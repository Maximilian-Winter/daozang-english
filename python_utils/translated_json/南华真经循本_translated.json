  "full_translation": "*The Southern Florescence True Classic: A Return to the Root*\n\n**Text Title:** *The Southern Florescence True Classic: A Return to the Root*\nAuthor: Luo Miandao of the Ming dynasty\nThirty fascicles\nSource edition: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category\n\n**Zhuangzi**\nNarrated by Luo Miandao of Luling Bamboo Peak\n\nZhuangzi was a man of Song, named Zhou, styled Zixiu. Born in Meng County of Suiyang, he once served as an officer in the Meng Lacquer Garden. His learning spanned all fields, yet its essence returned to the words of Laozi. Thus, he composed a work of over one hundred thousand characters, largely employing parables. His language flowed boundlessly, following his own inclinations, so that even kings and great ministers could not contain him.\n\nKing Wei of Chu, hearing of Zhuang Zhou’s worthiness, dispatched envoys with generous gifts to welcome him, offering the position of chief minister. Zhou laughed and said to the messengers: \"A thousand gold pieces are a weighty profit; the post of minister is a lofty rank. Have you alone not seen the sacrificial ox at the suburban rites? Reared for years, clad in embroidered robes, and led into the grand ancestral temple—at that moment, if it wished to be a lone piglet, could it do so? Begone swiftly, and do not defile me. I would rather wander and play in the filth, free and joyful, than be fettered by rulers. He never entered official service, fulfilling his own aspirations to the end.\"\n\nThe Tang dynasty posthumously enfeoffed him as the Perfected of Southern Florescence, and his book was titled *The Southern Florescence True Classic*.\n\n**Explanation of the Title in *The Southern Florescence True Classic: A Return to the Root***\n\nThough Zhuangzi’s writings are vast, uncanny, and strange, drifting beyond the Six Classics, they resemble heaven and earth, sun and moon—possessing constant principles and movements—yet wind and clouds open and close, spirits and ghosts transform, all of which cannot be lacking. Scholars of past and present have always marveled at them, yet their phrasing and diction belong to the language of the late Zhou, beyond the full comprehension of later ages.\n\nNevertheless, some passages remain verifiable. For instance, the questions of *Zheng* and *Huo* to the market supervisor regarding the measurement of hides correspond to the *Grand Archery* officers *Zheng* and *Huo* (see *The Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial*). The explanation of the ox with a white forehead, the pig with an upturned snout, and the man with hemorrhoids—none fit for the river—refers to the ancient Son of Heaven’s springtime expiatory sacrifices (see *The Han Treatise on Suburban Sacrifices*). *Tangzi* was the son of the *Chief of the Hall*, just as the legitimate son of the Zhou royal clan was called *Gate Master*. *Yitai* (Righteous Terrace) is *Yitai* (Ceremonial Terrace). Zheng Sinong said: \"In old texts, *yi* (ceremony) was written as *yi* (righteousness).\" The *doujian* (neck and shoulder) appears in *The Artificers’ Record*. The carpenter’s marking of the sounding stone’s hollows and numbers refers to *gu* (inspection), where *doujian* is the *gu* character. Such examples are numerous.\n\nWithout ancient learning, scholars cannot grasp these allusions. Many commentators either expound with empty discourse, drag in Chan Buddhist terms, or forcibly attach Confucian orthodox principles—most of which miss the original text’s intent.\n\nSlowly I remark: The marvelous subtleties of this text are peerless—yet who truly recognizes its wonder? Across the desolate span of eighteen hundred years, the author’s intent has remained pent-up and unexpressed, while plagiarists’ misapplications have only multiplied errors. Is this not a lamentable omission in the annals of cursive script?\n\nFortunately, I, Mian Dao, retired early to leisure, entrusting my aspirations to purity and emptiness. Thus, I found time to comb through a few passages with my humble insights, setting brush to paper until, unawares, a volume took shape. I dare hope this effort follows the original intent, and so I title it *Following the Root of the Zhuangzi*.\n\n*Following the Root of the Southern Florescence True Scripture*, Scroll One\nBy Lu Ling’s Bamboo Peak, Luo Mian Dao\nCollated by Disciple Peng Xiang\n\n**Inner Chapters: Free and Easy Wandering**\nTo wander freely without constraint—this is called *xiaoyaoyou* (free and easy wandering). Zhuangzi sought to inspire those who would study the Dao, and thus began with this title.\n\nThe Inner, Outer, and Miscellaneous Chapters are like sequential collections, with no fundamental difference in meaning. According to the *Han Arts and Letters*, the *Zhuangzi* originally comprised fifty-two chapters. Guo Xiang had already discerned that thirteen parts were cunningly spurious, leaving the extant thirty-three. Su Shi of the Eastern Slope later excised *Yielding the Throne*, *Robber Zhi*, *Discoursing on the Sword*, and *The Old Fisherman*, merging *Liezi* with the end of *Giving Away the Throne* into a single chapter—his judgment was precise. Yet I still deem *Refining the Will* and *Mending the Nature* superficial and inauthentic, and thus propose fixing the total at twenty-six chapters.\n\nThe Inner Chapters all establish their titles first, and the text’s meaning does not stray from them. The Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters merely extract the opening characters for their names, for the Inner Chapters’ intent suffices, while the Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters merely elaborate upon it.\n\n**In the northern darkness there is a fish, and his name is Kun.**\nThe vastness of Kun—who knows how many thousand *li* he spans? He transforms into a bird, and his name is Peng. The back of Peng—who knows how many thousand *li* it stretches? Roused to flight, his wings hang like clouds suspended from the sky. This bird, when the seas surge, will journey to the southern darkness. The southern darkness is the Celestial Pond.\n\nThe northern and southern darknesses are not merely the northern and southern seas, but the polar extremes of the sea, so distant and obscure that they are called *ming* (darkness). Kun, according to the *Erya*, is the general term for all fish roe, hence the *Nei Ze*’s \"roe sauce\" is read as *kun*. The *Lu Language* also states: \"In fish prohibitions, *kun* and *fu* both refer to fish roe.\" Zhuangzi takes the tiniest and makes it vast—this is the beginning of his playful absurdity. Peng does not appear in the classics. The *Island Barbarians’ Records* notes: \"In the layered lands of Kunlun, there is often a great Peng whose flight blots out the sun and can devour camels. A man once gathered a fallen Peng wing and cut its quill into a water bucket.\" Kun’s size is said to span \"who knows how many thousand *li*,\" and Peng’s back likewise—truly, the greater the substance, the greater its transformation.\n\n\"Roused to flight\" means mustering its fury to take off. \"When the seas surge, it will journey to the southern darkness\": *yun* (surge) means *dong* (movement). When typhoons arise, the sea’s *qi* stirs, and the bird migrates to avoid them. The *Lu Language* states: \"The *yuanju* bird halted outside the eastern gate of Lu for three days.\" Zhan Qin remarked: \"This year, the sea must be bracing for disaster.\" For the birds and beasts of great rivers all know to evade calamity. That year, the seas were beset by great winds, and the winter was unseasonably warm—this is the event in question.\n\nThe Celestial Pond is where the sea meets the sky, like the \"pond\" in \"bathing in the Salty Pond.\" A *chi* (pond) is where fish and birds alight; Peng’s alighting place is this pond. It is called the southern darkness, the Celestial Pond. Elsewhere it says: \"North of the barren lands, there is a dark sea, the Celestial Pond.\" For the term *minghai* (dark sea) still does not fully convey its remoteness, so it is further specified as the Celestial Pond, revealing it as the place where the sea meets the sky. This shows Peng’s flight from the northernmost sea to the southernmost, spanning such vast distances.\n\nThe opening speaks of Kun transforming into Peng, able to soar high and migrate far, drawing an analogy to humans transforming into sages or spirits, achieving the ultimate and attaining *xiaoyaoyou*. The word *hua* (transformation) appears at the outset; at first glance, it seems unremarkable, but upon closer reading, one realizes its indispensability.\n\n**The *Qi Xie* is a record of anomalies.**\nIts words state: \"When Peng journeys to the southern darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, ascends on the whirlwind to ninety thousand *li*, and departs with the six-month *xi* (breath).\" The *Qi Xie* is a book of Qi proverbs. Mencius said: \"The words of Qi’s rustics,\" so it is fitting that Qi customs would produce such proverbial sayings. The *Qi Xie*’s words are proverbial. Zhuangzi, though himself full of strange tales, calls the *Qi Xie* a \"record of anomalies\"—this is another instance of his playful absurdity.\n\n*Ji* (strike) means to beat. As Peng’s *qi* and momentum take flight, waves surge to a height of three thousand *li*. *Bo* (ascend) means to follow the wind’s circular motion. *Fuyao* (whirlwind) is a cyclone. The wind’s force lifts it in a spiraling ascent—hence the phrase \"the branches of the sea-bound whirlwind\" also draws from this meaning. \"Ninety thousand *li*\" refers to the distance from the northern darkness to the sky; from the Central Lands to the zenith, the distance would be even greater. According to the *Kao Ling Yao*: \"The celestial sphere spans 365¼ degrees, each degree measuring 2,932 *li* and 1,461/348 *li*. The circumference is 1,071,000 *li*. Taking the ratio of circumference to diameter as three to one, the diameter is 357,000 *li*—this is the diameter of the twenty-eight constellations’ circuit. Beyond the twenty-eight constellations, above, below, east, and west each extend 15,000 *li*, forming the four polar extremes, called the *sibiao* (four limits). Within the four limits and including the constellations, the total diameter is 387,000 *li*. The exact center of the sky is thus 193,500 *li*.\"\n\nThe earth lies at the center, with a thickness of thirty thousand *li*. At the spring equinox, the earth is precisely at the center. From this point, it gradually descends, and by the summer solstice, it has sunk fifteen thousand *li*, so that its upper edge aligns with the midpoint of the sky. After the summer solstice, the earth gradually rises again, and by the autumn equinox, it returns to the exact center of the sky. From there, it continues to ascend, and by the winter solstice, it has risen fifteen thousand *li*, so that its lower edge aligns with the midpoint of the sky. After the winter solstice, the earth gradually descends once more, perpetually ascending and descending within the span of thirty thousand *li*. The theory of the *siyou* (four movements) originally derives from the *Zhou Bei* text; whether the scholars of the armillary sphere acknowledge its validity remains uncertain, but their calculations of celestial degrees and terrestrial distances appear reliable. Furthermore, Zheng Xuan’s commentary on the *Rites of Zhou* employs the *gougu* method to measure the shadow of a gnomon, yielding 81,394 *li*, 30 *bu*, 5 *chi*, and 3 *cun* with 6 *fen*—this being the distance from the point directly beneath the sun to the earth, which is half the diameter of the sky. As for the phrase \"after six months of rest,\" it refers to the roc’s migration from the Northern Darkness to the Southern Darkness, traversing half the circumference of the sky, hence requiring only half a year of rest before pausing, demonstrating that the roc’s flight aligns with celestial measurements. The preceding passage speaks only of the distance of the roc’s migration; this section further proves the height of its flight. The initial statement of \"ninety thousand *li*\" is placed here, with the explanation following thereafter.\n\n\"Wild horses,\" \"dust,\" and \"living creatures blown by the breath\"—is the deep blue of the sky its true color? Or is it so distant that it has no limit? When viewed from above, it appears the same. *Xi* (息) means *qi*. \"Wild horses\" and \"dust\" are metaphors for the drifting *qi*. Zhang Zai of Hengqu said: \"The *qi* surges and swirls through the Great Void, ascending, descending, and soaring without cease. This is what the *Yi* calls *kunyi*, and what Zhuangzi refers to as 'living creatures blown by the breath'—is this not the 'wild horses'?\" Zhu Xi of Hui’an remarked: \"The Way of Qian forms the male, and the Way of Kun forms the female—this is the tumult of drifting *qi*.\" *Cangcang* (苍苍) is the color seen from afar. *Yi* (已) means \"to cease.\" This merely explains the phrase \"ninety thousand *li*.\" It warns against mistaking the drifting *qi*’s deep blue for the sky’s ultimate boundary, thereby doubting the existence of ninety thousand *li*. Thus, it clarifies that what appears in the Great Void like \"wild horses\" and \"dust\" is the creative power of nature, which uses this *qi* to animate living things. Humans, confined within this *qi*, remain unaware of it, perceiving only a distant, deep blue. Now, when we look up, is that deep blue the sky’s true color? Or is there still an infinite expanse beyond? Since the blue extends endlessly upward, the roc can ascend ninety thousand *li*. From above, looking down, the same deep blue appears—this is the realm of the tangible earth. It ceases here; no further ascent is possible. For the blue above is not like the blue below, which cannot be traversed. Du Meng of the Han said: \"The sky has no substance; when gazed upon, it is boundlessly high and distant, beyond the limits of human vision. Thus, it appears deep blue, which aligns with this passage.\" The phrase \"then it is so\" (*ze yi yi*) is often misread as \"and that is all\" (*er yi yi*), disrupting the coherence of the preceding and following text.\n\nAs for the transition—where passages often begin with phrases like \"furthermore\" (*qie fu*) or \"allow me to explain\" (*qing shi yan zhi*), recognizing this mechanism ensures the text remains unbroken—\n\nIf water is not deep, it lacks the strength to bear a great vessel. Pour a cup of water onto a level floor, and a mustard seed may serve as a boat; place a cup there, and it will stick fast, for the water is shallow and the vessel too large. If wind is not deep, it lacks the strength to bear great wings. Thus, at ninety thousand *li*, the wind lies beneath, and only then can one ride the wind. With the azure sky at one’s back and no obstacle to block the way, only then can one set course for the south.\n\n*Aotang* (坳堂) refers to a depression in the floor of a hall. \"A mustard seed as a boat\" means the seed floats like a vessel. *Pei* (培) means \"to accumulate.\" The \"azure sky\" is not the deep blue seen from below; only at ninety thousand *li* does the true azure appear. The preceding text states that deep blue is not the sky’s true color, so it is clear that azure is the true color. The Six Classics never speak of the \"azure sky,\" only the \"deep-blue sky,\" for they describe only what is visible. This further explains why the roc must fly to ninety thousand *li*: it requires the vast power of the wind to migrate so far. Water is likened to wind, and the vessel to the roc. If water is not deep, it cannot bear a great vessel; if wind is not deep, it cannot bear great wings. Thus, at ninety thousand *li*, the wind lies beneath, its force vast and abundant, and with the azure sky at one’s back, the celestial path is open and unobstructed. Only by harnessing this wind can the roc set course for the south. *Nai jin* (乃今) refers to the moment of migration. The following passage, \"and then it heads for the Southern Darkness,\" describes the completion of the journey.\n\nThis section describes the marvelous transformations of the *kun*-roc, citing the *Qi Xie* to prove its flight of ninety thousand *li*, and the passage on \"wild horses\" to clarify the principle behind reaching such heights. The cicada and the *yujiao* bird laughed at it, saying: \"I burst forth and fly, striking the elm and sandalwood; sometimes I do not reach them and simply fall to the ground—why go ninety thousand *li* to the south?\"\n\nThe *tiao* (蜩) is a black, cicada-like creature that sings in the fifth month; the *chan* (蝉) is mottled and sings after the seventh month; the *diaoliao* (蛁蟟) is green—there are many varieties. Commonly, they are all called cicadas, or *qianglang*, or water insects, or the transformations of *qicao* from dung. The *yujiao* (鸴鸠) is a bird originally named for its resemblance to the mountain magpie, hence called *hongjiu*. The *Monthly Ordinances* states: \"The *mingjiu* bird smooths its feathers.\" The commentary by Guo Pu cites: \"It resembles a mountain magpie but is smaller, with a short tail, dark blue-black, and very vocal. In the Jiangdong region, it is called *guzhuo* (鹘鸼).\"\n\nThe *Monthly Ordinances* states that in the second month of spring, the hawk transforms into the *jiu*; the *Royal Regulations* states that in the second month of autumn, the *jiu* transforms into the hawk. The *Zuozhuan* mentions the *Shuangjiu* clan, with Du’s commentary identifying it as the hawk. Since these two creatures transform into one another, the *jiu* may also be called the hawk. These two insects, small and capable of transformation, are thus contrasted with the *kun* and *peng*. \"To rise with decision\" means to take flight with all one’s strength, akin to the resolve in decisive battle. *Qiang* means to collide or strike. *Yu* and *fang* are the names of two trees. \"Sometimes I do not reach them and simply fall to the ground\"—at times, even the *yu* and *fang* are beyond my reach, and I must descend to the earth. This describes how the two insects cannot fly high, serving as the *tiao* and *jiu*’s mockery of the *peng*. How is one who ridicules the great Dao from a narrow perspective any different? One who travels to the *mangcang* returns after a day’s journey with a full belly; one who journeys a hundred *li* must prepare provisions the night before; one who travels a thousand *li* must gather supplies for three months. What do these two insects know? *Mangcang* refers to the distant haze, where the land appears green in a single glance. *Guo* describes a full belly, or courage—when the stomach is full, one is bold; when hungry, one is timid. The two insects are the *tiao* and *jiu*. The farther one travels, the more provisions one must accumulate; the broader the *peng*’s wings, the thicker the wind it must gather. What can these two insects possibly understand? Small knowledge does not reach great knowledge; short years do not reach long years. Both instances of *zhi* (知) are read in the level tone, linking the preceding and following phrases—a common stylistic device in Zhuangzi’s writing. The reason these two insects mock the *peng* is simply that their small understanding does not reach the *peng*’s great understanding. Thus, short and long years are used to illustrate small and great knowledge.\n\nHow do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows not the waxing and waning of the moon; the *huigū* knows not spring and autumn—these are short-lived creatures. South of Chu lies the *Mingling*, which takes five hundred years as its spring and five hundred years as its autumn. In high antiquity, there was the great *chun* tree, which takes eight thousand years as its spring and eight thousand years as its autumn. Yet Pengzu alone is renowned for his longevity—how pitiful it is that common people compare themselves to him! The *jun* is a ground fungus; the large ones are called *zhongdao*, while the small ones are called *jun*. The *jun*’s lifespan is measured in mornings, hence the term \"morning mushroom.\" The *huigū* is also a type of cicada. Zheng’s *Comprehensive Records* states: \"The *hanman*, properly called *huigū*, sings plaintively in the ninth and tenth months.\" Xiaoshan says: \"The *huigū* cries *zijiuzijiu*, and at year’s end, it has nothing to rely on.\" The *huigū* Zhuangzi refers to as knowing not spring and autumn is the small, purple-green cicada of the fourth and fifth months. *Ming* refers to the Southern Darkness; *ling* refers to the spirit turtle. The unicorn, phoenix, turtle, and dragon are called the Four Spirits. The *Mingling* is the spirit turtle of the Dark Sea. The morning mushroom and the great *chun* tree, the *huigū* and the *Mingling*, are presented as one plant and one animal in parallel—thus, it is clear that the *Mingling* is not a plant. \"Five hundred years as spring, five hundred years as autumn\"—the *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"A thousand-year-old turtle measures one foot and two inches.\" Two sets of five hundred years make up the thousand-year count. \"Eight thousand years as spring, eight thousand years as autumn\"—the character *chun* (椿) is split into two *eight* and *hundred*, multiplied by ten to yield two sets of eight thousand. This is likely a playful fabrication by the jester, akin to the character *hai* (亥) with its two heads and six bodies. Yet it has deceived the world for a thousand years, and none have seen through it.\n\nGenerally, when such things appear, people routinely dismiss them as allegory, unaware that even allegory must have some basis in resemblance. Those who read the *Zhuangzi* closely and see through such fabrications will find the art of the absurd exhausted.\n\nPeng Zu and ordinary people represent the short and long spans of human life. To compare ordinary people to Peng Zu is to make their lot pitiable indeed. This speaks to the vast disparity between short and long lifespans, just as there is between lesser and greater knowledge.\n\nThis is what Tang’s inquiry of Ji amounted to:\nThe passage where Tang questions Ji serves as a parallel to the cicada and the fledgling mocking the roc. In the far northern reaches of the barren lands lies the Dark Sea, a celestial lake. There is a fish there, its breadth spanning several thousand *li*, its length unknown—its name is Kun. There is also a bird there, named Peng, its back like a great mountain, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky. It beats the whirling winds, rising ninety thousand *li*, piercing the clouds, bearing the blue heavens on its back, then setting its course southward, bound for the Southern Darkness.\n\nThe quail scoffs at it, saying: \"Where is it off to? I leap and flutter upward, rising no more than a few yards before descending, wheeling among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the height of flight! Where is it off to?\" Such is the distinction between the small and the great.\n\nThe term \"ram's horns\" describes the spiraling form of the whirling winds. *Dream Pool Essays* records: \"In Wucheng County of Enzhou, a cyclone arose from the southwest, towering into the sky like ram's horns, and officials along with all the residents were swept into the clouds.\" *Miscellaneous Records* further states: \"A family in Meizhou kept several hundred fish in a deep pond for over thirty years. One day, under a clear sky without thunder, the pond roared like a storm, and all the fish leapt upward in a spiral like ram's horns, vanishing without a trace.\" Both accounts capture the essence of Zhuangzi’s original meaning.\n\n\"Piercing the clouds at ninety thousand *li*\"—at such heights, the clouds lie far below. \"Barren land\" refers to the saline-alkali flats, as in the *Book of Documents*: \"the vast saline shores by the sea.\" The *yan* (鴳) is a quail, akin to the sparrow and cicada. Fan’s commentary cites the *Rites of the Duke of Zhou*, identifying the *yan* as a quail. Li Xun notes: \"The *ru* (鴽) is the *yan*, which is the quail.\" The *Monthly Ordinances* of late spring state: \"Field mice transform into quails.\" Thus, the *yan* is but a minor transformation, hence its comparison to the cicada and turtledove.\n\nMoreover, Zhuangzi turns to the seashore to find a creature of slight transformation, illustrating how the cicada and turtledove mock the Peng. The turtledove, in its transformation, has lost its predatory instincts, while the cicada, barely freed from the mire, flits low between the elm and sandalwood, devoid of far-reaching vision. Their mockery is thus unsurprising—like rustic villagers who know nothing of great lords and sages.\n\nThough the barren-land quail is small in nature, confined to mugwort and wormwood, it dwells by the sea, where the vastness of the cosmos and the boundlessness of wind and moon are ever before its eyes. Yet even it presumptuously ridicules the great Peng. In human terms, this mirrors those who, though they walk in the footsteps of sages, remain incorrigibly foolish, abandoning all hope of self-improvement.\n\nThe passage from *Tang’s Inquiry of Ji* that follows gathers the threads of the preceding text. The earlier account from *Qi Xie’s Records of the Strange* now gives way to *Tang’s Inquiry of Ji*, which presents the matter as factual. Previously, the size of the Kun was said to span \"several thousand *li*,\" here its breadth is confirmed as \"several thousand *li*.\" Earlier, the Peng’s back was described as \"several thousand *li*,\" here it is likened to \"a great mountain.\" Where before it was said to \"beat the whirling winds and rise,\" here the phrase \"ram’s horns\" is added to depict its form.\n\nThis section expounds on the minor transformations of the cicada, turtledove, and barren-land quail, which mock the Peng’s ascent of ninety thousand *li*. The phrase \"ninety thousand *li*\" appears four times, with the primary aim of elucidating this line. It underscores that the Celestial Lake truly lies ninety thousand *li* from the heavens. The vastness of the void is boundless, and the spirit roams unobstructed, shattering the shallow, cramped views of the worldly and broadening the heart’s capacity for freedom.\n\nThus, the first passage sets forth a parable, while this section turns to a discussion of human nature.\n\nThose who take pride in fulfilling a single office, matching their conduct to a single village, aligning their virtue with a single lord, or winning the trust of a single state—such men regard themselves no differently than the cicada, turtledove, or barren-land quail. What sets them apart from those small-minded creatures? Yet even Song Rongzi would laugh at them.\n\nMoreover, when the whole world praises him, he feels no added encouragement; when the whole world condemns him, he feels no added discouragement. He has settled the distinction between inner and outer, discerned the boundary between honor and disgrace—this alone suffices. In his dealings with the world, he is not restless or eager. Still, he has yet to establish himself fully.\n\nThe phrase \"yet even\" describes his mocking demeanor, akin to the sense of \"still.\" The earlier group mocked the great with the small; Song Rongzi, in turn, mocks them by mocking the small with the great. Not only can he laugh at the former group, but he also embodies what follows. \"Not restless or eager\" means he is not anxious, while \"establish\" means to stand firm. Song Rongzi is not swayed by others’ praise or blame; the division of inner and outer, the boundary of honor and disgrace, are clear in his heart. He believes his self-possession is sufficient. Though he is not anxious about worldly affairs, he has yet to stand firm in solitude.\n\nLiezi could ride the wind and travel, soaring lightly and skillfully, returning only after fifteen days. Yet even he, in seeking good fortune, was not restless or eager. Though he avoided walking, he still depended on something. But one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth, harnesses the transformations of the six qi, and roams boundlessly—what does he depend on?\n\n\"Lightly\" conveys the clarity of the wind; \"skillfully\" means he excels at it. \"Fifteen days\" refers to half a month, a span far briefer than the Peng’s half-year breath. \"Seeking good fortune\" means he relies on the wind to travel, and the wind’s rising is his fortune. \"Not restless or eager\" means he is not anxious to obtain the wind as his fortune.\n\nOne who rides is the master, while one who harnesses is the assistant. The constancy of Heaven and Earth is the Supreme Ultimate moving to generate yang and settling to generate yin. What humans receive to live is called by Daoists the \"primordial qi.\" The six qi—yin and yang, wind and rain, darkness and light—include the Jueyin wind-wood, Shaoyin sovereign fire, Shaoyang ministerial fire, Taiyin damp-earth, Yangming dry-metal, and Taiyang cold-water. Though their names differ, their essence is the same, dispersed throughout Heaven and Earth and present within the human body.\n\nTo take constancy as the master and the six qi as the harness is akin to Laozi’s image of thirty spokes sharing one hub. Liezi surpasses Song Rongzi, yet he still depends on something. This group has yet to achieve complete transformation. But one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth, harnesses the transformations of the six qi, and spirit-roams without limit—all is drawn from within, so what need is there for external dependence? At this stage, all is transformed.\n\nThe following passage refers to those who attain this:\n\nThus, the perfected person has no self, the spirit-person has no merit, the sage has no fame.\n\nPrevious interpretations mistakenly treat these three lines as a conclusion to the above, but they actually introduce what follows. Having described two groups whose transformations are limited, this passage now turns to three groups whose transformations are vast. To be great and transformed is called sageliness; to be sagely and unfathomable is called spirit; the ultimate is called perfection. These three ranks also have degrees of depth. Without merit, there is no achievement, and thus no fame. Without self, even the self vanishes—how then could there be achievement?\n\nThe following passages provide evidence for each:\n\nXu You is a sage; the ethereal immortals of Mount Gushe are spirit-persons; the four masters are perfected persons.\n\nWhen Yao offered the world to Xu You, he said: \"The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for it to shine? The timely rain has fallen, yet you still irrigate—is it not laborious to bring moisture? You stand and the world is ordered, yet I still occupy your place. I see my own inadequacy—please, let me yield the world to you.\"\n\nXu You replied: \"You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. If I were to replace you, would I do so for fame? Fame is but the guest of reality—would I become a guest?\"\n\nThe wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs no more than a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes no more than a full belly. Return and rest, my lord—what use have you for the world? Though the cook neglects his kitchen, the invocator does not leap over the wine vessels and sacrificial stands to take his place.\n\nXu You withdrew to Mount Ji. The Grand Historian says: I ascended Mount Ji, and atop it lies the tomb of Xu You.\n\n*Stand* means to rise. *Corpse* means master. *Inadequate* means insufficient. Yao said that if Xu You were to rise, the world would be well-governed, yet he himself still occupied the position—seeing his own inadequacy, he could not compare to Xu You.\n\n*Name* is the guest of *reality*. Reality is the host, while name is the guest. \"Would I become a guest?\"—he refused to pursue fame.\n\nThe *jiao'ao* resembles a small yellow sparrow, also called *jiaoqiu*, or *tao que*; it is the \"tiao insect\" of the *Book of Songs*, commonly said to give birth to eagles. The *yan shu* is the mole, a large rat.\n\n\"Return and rest, my lord\"—to rest is to cease. When Yao visited Xu You, Xu You told him to return and set aside the matter of yielding the world. The repetition of \"my lord\" at the end conveys his deep respect.\n\nThis explains that the sage has no name, hence his words: \"Would I become a name? Name is the guest of reality—would I become a guest?\"\n\nJian Wu asked Lian Shu: \"I heard words from Jie Yu that were vast but without measure, going forth but never returning. I was alarmed and terrified by his speech—it was like the Milky Way, boundless and without end, wildly divergent and far from human sentiment.\" Lian Shu said: \"What did his words say?\"\n\nHe said: \"On the distant Mount Miaogu—*Miaogu* as in Song Guangping’s *Rhapsody on the Plum Blossom*, where it is glossed as *ye*—there dwells a spirit-person. Their skin is like ice and snow, their bearing supple as a maiden’s. They eat no grain, but drink the wind and sip the dew. They ride the clouds and qi, mount flying dragons, and roam beyond the four seas. Their spirit is so concentrated that they keep things free from blight and pestilence, and the yearly harvests ripen.\n\nI deem this mad and unbelievable.\"\n\nLian Shu said: \"Just as the blind cannot partake in the sight of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums, is it only the body that can be blind and deaf? The mind, too, may suffer such afflictions. These words of his are like *this maiden here*—these eight characters form a single phrase.\n\nThat person, that power of theirs, sweeps across the ten thousand things to unify them. The world seeks order, yet who would exhaust themselves over the affairs of the world? That person—nothing harms them. Though the great floods rise to the heavens, they do not drown; though great droughts melt metal and stone and scorch the mountains, they do not burn. Their dust and husks could still mold and cast a Yao or Shun—who would trouble themselves with worldly affairs?\n\nThe names of persons in Zhuangzi’s words may be real or fictitious; we cannot know whether Jian Wu and Lian Shu were historical, but Jie Yu was the Madman of Chu. Hence the following line: *I deem this mad and unbelievable.* ‘Going forth but never returning’ means speaking without ever looking back. *Jing* is the path before the gate; *ting* is the ground outside the hall. *Greatly divergent* means that while the path and courtyard are not far apart, Jie Yu’s words differ so vastly from ordinary speech that they seem as distant as the path is from the courtyard.\n\nMount Miaogu appears in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. *Naoyue* means pure and refined. *Chuzi* means maiden. *They keep things free from blight and pestilence, and the yearly harvests ripen* describes the transformative influence of their presence. *These words of his are like this maiden here*—these eight characters should be read as a single phrase, referring to Jie Yu. *You* means ‘like’; *shi* means ‘this’; *nü* means maiden, continuing the earlier description of the spirit-person’s bearing as *supple as a maiden’s*. As in the following line, where the word *yan* (words) is followed by *ye* (is), this is a rhetorical softening—reading it as two separate phrases would be incorrect.\n\n*Bangbo* is the sound of rolling stones, describing their power to set the ten thousand things in motion. *Seeking order* means desiring governance. *Bibi* means weary and burdened. *Dust and husks could still mold and cast a Yao or Shun*—what Yao and Shun attained was what the spirit-person discards. This speaks of the spirit-person’s lack of merit. It is said, *there dwells a spirit-person*, and again, *they keep things free from blight and pestilence, and the yearly harvests ripen*; *sweeps across the ten thousand things to unify them*; *the world seeks order*—all speak of merit.\n\nThe people of Song took ceremonial caps to Yue, but the Yue people cut their hair and tattooed their bodies, having no use for them. When Yao governed the people of the world and brought peace to the seas, he went to see the Four Masters on Mount Miaogu by the north bank of the Fen River, and there he was so overwhelmed that he forgot his rule over the world. The Four Masters need not be identified by name. Fenyang was Yao’s capital. After meeting the Four Masters on Mount Miaogu, Yao returned to the north bank of the Fen River, where he was as if bereft of his rule over the world—seeing the Four Masters had made him lose himself.\n\nThis first presents an analogy: the Yue people cut their hair and tattoo their bodies, so what use do they have for the ceremonial caps of Song? The Four Masters lived in reclusion in the mountains—what did they care for Yao’s governance? This speaks of the perfected person’s selflessness. The Four Masters knew no self, and when Yao saw them, he too lost what was his own.\n\nHui Shi said to Zhuangzi: \"The King of Wei gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to hold five *dan*. When filled with water or broth, its strength was not enough to lift itself. I split it open to make ladles, but they were too shallow and wobbled, holding little. Was it not vast and hollow? Yet I smashed it for its uselessness.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"You are truly inept at putting great things to use. There was a man of Song skilled in making an unchapping salve, and his family made their living for generations by washing and bleaching silk floss. A traveler heard of it and offered a hundred gold pieces for the recipe. The family gathered and deliberated: ‘We have washed and bleached silk floss for generations, earning only a few pieces of gold. Now we can sell this skill for a hundred gold in a single morning—let us give it to him.’ The traveler obtained it and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue raised a rebellion, the King of Wu made him a general. In winter, they fought on the water, and he routed the Yue forces. The king then enfeoffed him with land. The same ability to prevent chapping hands led one to a fief and another to a life of washing silk floss—the difference lay in how it was used.\n\nNow you have a gourd that holds five *dan*—why not consider making it into a great float and drifting upon the rivers and lakes? Instead, you fret that it is too shallow and wobbles, holding little. Then your mind is still like the tangled *peng* plant—bound to the thickets of the hills and marshes, unable to float upon the rivers and lakes.\"\n\nThis speaks of the use of a single vessel not yet transformed—if one were to float upon the rivers and lakes, it would be transformed.\n\nHui Shi said to Zhuangzi: \"I have a great tree—people call it the *chu*. Its trunk is gnarled and swollen, not fitting the inked line; its branches are twisted and curled, not fitting the compass or square. It stands by the road, but carpenters do not glance at it. Now your words are vast but useless—everyone rejects them alike.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Have you never seen the wildcat or the weasel? The *li sheng* is the weasel, shaped like a flying squirrel, reddish-yellow, with a large tail. It can devour mice—commonly called the *mouse-catcher*.\"\n\nGuo Pu states: \"In the region east of the Yangtze, it is called *sheng*.\" Crouching low, it lies in wait for the wandering creatures—*ao* (a term for creatures that roam freely, such as fowl and rodents). Leaping east and west, it bounds without regard for high or low, only to be caught in the snare’s trap—*pi* (entering the mechanism, as if subjected to punishment). It dies in the hunter’s net.\n\nNow consider the *li* ox—its size like clouds hanging from the heavens. This creature may be great, yet it cannot catch mice. The *li sheng*, though small, can capture prey but instead meets harm. The ox, vast yet unable to seize mice, preserves its life. Now you possess a great tree—why not plant it in the land of Nothing Whatever, the boundless wilds? Wander idly by its side, recline carefree beneath its shade. Unfelled by axes, untouched by harm, though of no use—where then lies its suffering?\n\nThis speaks of the use of a single tree not yet transformed—if one were to plant it in the land of Nothing Whatever, the boundless wilds, it would be transformed.\n\nThis chapter, titled \"Free and Easy Wandering,\" is threaded throughout by a single character: *transformation*. The first section describes the transformations of the *kun*-peng, the cicada, the fledgling dove, and the quail—each differing in scale, and thus their flight in height and depth. The second section speaks of human transformation, which likewise varies in magnitude, and thus the quality of their free and easy wandering. The third section shows that one may transform the useless into the useful and thereby achieve free and easy wandering.\n\nFor what Heaven bestows is fixed in measure—how could the cicada, fledgling dove, or quail be forced to match the *kun*-peng? Yet among humans, whether wise or foolish, worthy or unworthy, all may ascend the great Dao. Some, however, see themselves as the cicada, fledgling dove, or quail. Thus, at the chapter’s end, it is made clear: though one may resemble the hollow gourd, too frail to lift, or the *chu* tree—gnarled, swollen, and twisted—if one adapts to one’s nature and transforms with circumstance, how could one fail to achieve free and easy wandering?\n\n*The Classic of Southern Florescence, Following the Original Text, Scroll the First* (concluded)\n*The Classic of Southern Florescence, Following the Original Text, Scroll the Second*\n\n**Lu Lingzhu Peak’s Luo Miandao, Recorded by Disciple Peng Xiang (Collated Text)**\n\n**Inner Chapters: On the Equality of Things (Part One)**\n\nDuring the Warring States period, scholarship was in disarray, and disputes over right and wrong swarmed like bees. The ways of the world and the hearts of men had sunk into deep delusion. Confucians sought to silence heterodox doctrines and bar perverse conduct to safeguard the Way of the former sages. The teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, however, simply preserved their innate nature, never contending with others. Affirming what was right because it was right, rejecting what was wrong because it was wrong—thus, by allowing their inequalities to find their own equilibrium, they achieved harmony.\n\nThis chapter largely engages with Master Gongsun Long, addressing questions such as \"Is this right because that is wrong?\" or \"Is this wrong because that is right?\"—debates over \"white horses are not horses,\" the hardness and whiteness of stone, and the sameness or difference of things, all of which stem from Gongsun Long’s arguments.\n\nNanguo Ziqi leaned against his armrest, sat in stillness, lifted his gaze to the heavens, and exhaled deeply. His breath issued forth with a sound like *ta*, as if he had lost his other half. Nanguo Ziqi’s posture—leaning low over the armrest—was one of deep repose. *Xu* describes the act of opening the mouth to release breath; *ta* signifies the closing of the lips. One moment he bowed forward over the armrest, the next he tilted his head back to exhale, then suddenly closed his mouth. In an instant, three transformations unfolded, vivid as a painting. \"Losing his other half\" refers to the spirit’s pairing with form; here, he had cast off ears, eyes, and bodily frame as if dead.\n\nYan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, \"What is this state you have entered?\" Could one’s form truly be made like withered wood, and one’s heart like dead ashes? The one who now leans upon the armrest is not the same as the one who did so before.\n\nYan Cheng Ziyou was a disciple of Ziqin, surnamed Yan, given name Yan, styled Ziyou, posthumously honored as Cheng. The word \"could\" expresses his astonishment at the possibility. He marveled that a person’s form and heart could be brought to such a state, finding it both strange and admirable. The \"before\" refers to the moment when Ziqi leaned upon the armrest and gazed heavenward—then, he had seemed alive; now, he appeared as if dead.\n\nZiqi replied, \"Yan, is it not fitting that you ask this? Is it not fitting that I, in this state, should be questioned? Now, I have lost myself—do you understand?\" The *shen* (spirit) is \"I,\" the *xing* (form) is \"me.\" Though *wu* (I), *wo* (me), and *ji* (self) may seem interchangeable, *wo* and *ji* still carry a sense of personal attachment. Thus, Confucius spoke of \"overcoming the self\" when instructing Yan Yuan. Daoist cultivation refines the primordial spirit, regarding the body as something to be cast aside. In the moment when Ziqi’s breath issued forth with *ta*, his spirit withdrew into stillness, and both body and heart dissolved. Hence, he said, \"Now, I have lost myself.\" The question \"Do you understand?\" was Ziqi’s way of turning the inquiry back to Ziyou, then proceeding to explain.\n\n\"You have heard the *lai* of man but not the *lai* of earth; you have heard the *lai* of earth but not the *lai* of heaven. The *lai* of man leads to the *lai* of earth, and the *lai* of earth leads to the *lai* of heaven. If you were to hear the discourse on the *lai* of earth and heaven, you would understand why I have lost myself.\"\n\nZiyou said, \"May I ask the method?\"\n\nZiqi replied, \"The great clod—when it exhales its breath, called wind, nothing stirs. But when it stirs, the myriad hollows roar in fury. Have you alone never heard the long, sighing gusts? The great clod is heaven and earth. *Canliao* is the sound of the ceaseless wind, which, when prolonged, reaches far and wide. The mountain forests bend and sway, the great trees of a hundred spans hollowed with cavities—some like noses, some like mouths, some like ears, some like beams, some like rings, some like mortars. Noses, mouths, and ears resemble human forms; beams are stacked with gaps; rings are round and hollow within; mortars are sunken in the center—these resemble the shapes of vessels. Some resemble *jia* (pools), some resemble *wu* (puddles). *Jia* are where water gathers in ox tracks; *wu* are where water flows into depressions—these resemble the forms of earth. Some sounds are rushing, some whistling, some hissing, some inhaling, some wailing, some howling, some deep, some shrill. The first group describes shapes; this group describes sounds. *Ji* is like the rush of water; *xiao* is like the whir of an arrow in flight; *chi* is like a shout; *xi* is like a gasp; *jiao* is like a cry; *hao* is like a lament; *yao* is like a deep murmur; *yao* is like the caw of a crow. The first sounds lead, and the following sounds respond. *Yu* and *gan* are interchangeable—Han Fei said, \"The *gan* is the chief of the five notes.\" *Yu* describes the chorus of hollows, like fish mouths gaping in unison. A gentle breeze brings a faint harmony; a whirlwind brings a mighty harmony. When the fierce wind subsides, all the hollows fall silent.\n\nThe words \"leading\" and \"responding\" illustrate the nature of *lai*. Have you alone never seen the *tiaotiao* and *diaodiao*? *Tiaotiao* and *diaodiao* describe the swaying of treetops in the wind, a gentle, trembling motion. Today, people colloquially call a light breeze \"the *tiaotiao* wind.\" Tea-pickers refer to tender shoots as *diao*, plucking them with a *diaodiao* motion. This passage describes the *lai* of earth: when the wind rises, there are many sounds; when it ceases, all is suddenly still. Human life is just like this—this leads into the following discussion.\n\nZiyou said, \"The *lai* of earth is the chorus of the myriad hollows; the *lai* of man is the harmony of pipes and flutes. May I ask about the *lai* of heaven?\"\n\nZiqi replied, \"The wind blows in ten thousand different ways, yet each finds its own tone and measure. All things take their forms as they will—who is it that stirs them to anger?\" The word \"self\" here corresponds to the earlier \"me.\" Heaven’s generation of things is like the blowing of the wind. To depict the *lai* of heaven, the text employs the word \"blow.\" Though the wind blows in ten thousand different ways, it allows each to arise as if of its own accord, with the Creator having no part in it. All these manifold transformations are self-generated, their forceful emergence—who, then, is responsible?\n\nThe term \"anger\" (*nu*) must not be narrowly understood as human emotion; it signifies the violent emergence of manifold transformations, like the wind’s fierce onslaught that rouses the myriad hollows to a sudden clamor.\n\nGreat wisdom is expansive (*xianxian*), small wisdom is divisive (*jianjian*).\nGrand speech blazes (*yanyan*), petty chatter drones on (*zhanzhan*).\n*Xianxian* means layered defense upon defense.\n*Jianjian* means gap upon gap.\n*Yanyan* describes a scorching, overpowering presence.\n*Zhanzhan* conveys incessant, nagging insistence.\nThis speaks of the differences in people’s understanding and speech.\n\nIn sleep, the *hun*-souls intermingle; in waking, the body opens to the sounds of instruction, engaging with things in ceaseless construction, daily waging battle in the heart.\nShao Kangjie said: The spirit (*shen*) is the master of man. When one is about to sleep, it resides in the spleen; in deep sleep, it rests in the kidneys; when about to wake, it stirs in the liver; and upon full waking, it settles in the heart. What Zhuangzi calls the *hun* is what Kangjie terms the *shen*. In sleep, the spirit converges in the kidneys, and the body is still; in waking, the spirit abides in the heart, and the body moves. Upon waking and encountering things, countless schemes arise—this is elaborated below.\n\n*Man* (slow, tangled) is pronounced like *mo* (莫) and *ban* (半) combined.\n*Man* refers to undecorated silk, likening it to schemes so intricate they remain unseen. The *Shengyun Song* in the *Book of Rites* says, \"The rites are *manman* (错综) indeed,\" also invoking the sense of intricate interweaving.\n*Jiong* (cramped) and *mi* (dense).\n*Jiong* means digging into the earth to conceal things.\n*Mi* means fine and close-knit.\nThese three phrases describe the machinations of men, their syntax paralleling the earlier \"impetuous\" (*ji*) and \"resonant\" (*xiao*).\n\nSmall fears leave one trembling (*zhuizhui*), great fears leave one entangled (*manman*).\nIn minor fear, one trembles and cannot hold oneself together; in great fear, one’s schemes become like woven threads.\nThe syntax here parallels the earlier \"small harmony.\"\n\nTheir eruption is like the release of a crossbow’s trigger—this describes their judgment of right and wrong.\nTheir outward discharge is like an arrow loosed from a bow, the trigger (*ji gua*) inevitably finding its mark. Such is their fixation on right and wrong.\n\nTheir withering is like autumn and winter, speaking of their daily decline.\nTheir drowning in what they do makes it impossible for them to return.\nTheir sorrowful decay is like autumn’s desolation, speaking of how their hearts, scorched by toil and thought, daily waste away. This is further emphasized: such is the result of their submersion in worldly desires, rendering them incapable of self-reflection.\n\nTheir stifling and sinking are like a sealed letter, speaking of their aging in the mire.\nThe heart near death cannot be revived.\nTheir suffocation is like a bound and fastened letter, speaking of how they end their days in the ditches of craving. This is further emphasized: such is the heart nearing death, beyond restoration.\n\nFrom \"their eruption like the release of a crossbow’s trigger\" to \"beyond revival,\" the meaning parallels \"when the fierce wind subsides, the myriad hollows fall silent\"—have you not seen the swaying and trembling of reeds?\n\nHere, the text plainly declares the collapse of moral instruction. Yet below, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight suddenly arise again, revealing the surplus of its literary power.\n\nJoy, anger, sorrow, and delight; anxiety, sighing, transformation, and vexation; attachment, composure, abandon, and poise.\nThe character *zhi* (慹) combines \"grasp\" (*zhi* 执) and \"heart\" (*xin* 心), signifying a heart bound and constrained.\n*Yao* means governance; *yi* means dissipation; *qi* means the opening of clarity; *tai* means demeanor. Xunzi likewise said: \"None fail to be beautiful and alluring, adorned in strange garments and womanly finery, with blood, *qi*, demeanor, and bearing.\"\nConfucian texts speak only of the seven emotions, but Zhuangzi expands them to twelve.\n\nMusic emerges from emptiness; mushrooms form from steam.\nThese twelve are like music arising from the void or morning mushrooms sprouting from earth’s vapor. The pitch-pipes begin with the generation of one from nothing, then proceed from one to three, to nine, passing through the twelve earthly branches to reach 177,147—the true number of the Yellow Bell. From this, the twelve pitches are derived through reduction and augmentation. This is what is meant by \"music emerging from emptiness\" and \"mushrooms forming from steam\"—both born of the void, serving to depict the *lai* of heaven.\n\nDay and night succeed one another before us, yet none know where they sprout.\nEnough, enough!\n\nAt dawn and dusk we attain this—from whence does it arise?\nA sigh, and words: enough, enough!\nMortals rest content with this, attaining it but at dawn and dusk, yet mistaking it for the very source of their being.\n\nThis passage speaks of heaven’s *lai*.\nHeaven’s generation of humanity produces manifold emotions—\njust as when the wind stirs, manifold sounds arise.\nFrom the opening of the chapter to this point, Zhuangzi recounts the dialogue between Ziqi and his disciple, and what follows expands upon this theme.\n\nWithout that, there is no self; without the self, nothing is received.\nThis comes close, yet one knows not what compels it.\nAs if a true master existed, though no trace of it appears above.\nIts efficacy is trustworthy, yet its form remains unseen—it has power but no shape.\n\nTaking Ziqi’s \"the wind blows in ten thousand different ways, yet each finds its own accord\" and extracting its essence:\nthe argument that without that there is no self corresponds to \"the wind blows in ten thousand different ways, yet each finds its own accord\";\nwithout the self, nothing is received corresponds to \"each finds its own accord.\"\nWithout that creator, there would be no burden of self; without this self, how could one grasp so many transformations?\n\nZiqi’s explanation comes close, yet still falls short—\nit fails to reach the point where these transformations are commanded.\nThat which commands and is obeyed is as if a true master existed.\nThis true master is the wondrous truth of the Limitless, the union of the two qi and the five phases that constitute human life.\n\nWithin the human body resides this true master, and thus blood and qi are commanded,\nthe manifold transformations gathered in stillness, though no sign or omen is discernible.\nThere is no place to apply effort, yet its efficacy is verifiable—\nthe person who attains the Dao may deeply believe in it, yet ultimately cannot grasp it.\nThough there is the union of Kan and Li, the embrace of mother and child,\nand lingering affection, its essence remains formless.\nThis is the great Daoist principle from which the alchemical classics arise.\n\nThe hundred bones, nine orifices, six viscera—\nthe kidneys alone are two—all abide within, yet with whom shall I be intimate?\nDo you delight in all equally?\nOr is there partiality?\n\nAre all these but servants and handmaids?\nAre servants and handmaids insufficient to govern one another?\nDo they take turns as lord and subject?\nYet there is a true lord abiding within.\n\nTurning inward to my own body,\nthe hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera—none are not fully present.\nWith whom shall I be intimate?\nAgain posing the question to myself:\nDo you delight in all equally?\nOr is there partiality?\nThere is no principle of partial love.\n\nIf this be so, then are all but servants and handmaids?\nIf all are servants and handmaids, they are insufficient to govern one another,\nand must alternate as lord and subject.\nYet in winding through these doubts and difficulties, the conclusion remains:\nthere is a true lord abiding within.\nIt is the true lord that commands the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera.\nThe true lord is the true master—here only the terms \"lord\" and \"subject\" vary.\n\nWhether one attains this reality or not,\nit neither benefits nor harms the true.\nOnce receiving this completed form,\nit does not perish until its end.\nThis \"reality\" is the reality of having form yet being formless.\nWhether one attains this reality or not,\nit remains within the true,\nneither diminishing nor enhancing it—ever thus.\n\nFrom the moment one receives form, this true essence exists,\nborn together with life, never lost,\nawaiting only the exhaustion of form.\nYet in contending and yielding with things,\none’s actions race to their end like a galloping horse,\nand none can halt them—is this not lamentable?\nA lifetime of toil without seeing success,\nwearily laboring without knowing one’s destination—how can this not be pitiful?\nPeople call this \"not dying,\" but what benefit is there?\nWhen form transforms, the heart transforms with it—\ncan this not be called great sorrow?\n\n\"Contending\" means mutual harm;\n\"yielding\" means mutual submission.\nForm bears the true, and when form transforms, the heart transforms with it.\nWhat was said to \"not perish\" is also exhausted.\nThus it is said: \"Is this not lamentable?\"\nAgain: \"How can this not be pitiful?\"\nAnd again: \"Can this not be called great sorrow?\"\nThe words grow ever more poignant, its warning to the world ever deeper.\n\nIs human life inherently so deluded?\nAm I alone deluded, while others are not?\n\"Deluded\" means ignorant and unknowing.\n\nThis passage follows Zhuangzi’s discourse on the heavenly pipes,\npointing to the original endowment of the true master at life’s inception.\nThe subsequent sections vividly expound on right and wrong,\nshowing that such disputes are futile—\none need only clarify this true master.\n\nIf one follows the completed heart and takes it as teacher,\nwho alone would lack a teacher?\nWhy must one know the alternation of days and nights to realize the heart’s self-appropriation?\nEven the foolish possess this.\nBefore the heart is formed and yet there is right and wrong,\nit is like arriving in Yue today yet claiming to have arrived yesterday—\nturning nothing into something.\nEven if the divine Yu existed, he could not know such things—\nhow much less could I?\n\n\"Following the completed heart and taking it as teacher\"—\nthis continues from the exchange between Ziqi and his disciples.\n\"Why must one know the alternation of days and nights to realize the heart’s self-appropriation\"—\nthis follows from the idea that day and night alternate, each appropriating its time.\nThe \"completed heart\" is the heart governed by the true master,\nthe lord of all affairs.\nWithout this lord, the heart wanders east and west, never settled.\nThose who study the Way need not seek teachers externally—\nturning inward, the heart itself is sufficient.\nThis true master resides in all people,\npresent even in the ignorant and unknowing,\nnot only in those who understand the principle of day and night alternating, each self-appropriating.\nEven the foolish possess it.\n\nIf one does not know where the true master resides,\nand the heart is not yet formed yet already engages in disputes over right and wrong,\nit is like setting out for Yue today yet claiming to have arrived yesterday—\nis there any such principle?\nEven the divine Yu could not turn nothing into something to know the affairs of the world—\nhow much less could I?\n\nSpeech is not like the wind’s blowing.\nSpeakers have words, yet what they say remains unsettled.\nIs there truly speech?\nOr has there never been speech?\nDoes it differ from the chirping of fledglings?\nIs there distinction, or is there none?\n\nThis continues from the idea that the myriad things are not blown by the same wind.\nHuman speech is not like the heavenly pipes’ blowing of the ten thousand things, which is without intent.\nRather, it is the words of speakers.\nOnce issuing from people, how can it be free of partiality?\nThus its words remain unsettled, unreliable as a standard.\nBeing unsettled, people regard it as if it were nothing.\nHence it is said: Is there truly speech?\nOr has there never been speech?\n\nFledglings just hatched from the egg—\npeople hear the sounds of birds:\nmagpies herald good fortune, crows ill fortune,\nstorks’ cries foretell rain, cuckoos’ urge plowing—\nthese can be taken as reliable.\nBut the chirping of fledglings is unsettled and cannot be taken as reliable.\nHuman speech, being unsettled, is likewise.\n\nWhere is the Dao hidden that it has truth and falsehood?\nWhere is speech hidden that it has right and wrong?\nWhere does the Dao go that it does not abide?\nWhere does speech abide that it cannot be relied upon?\nThe Dao is hidden in minor accomplishments,\nspeech is hidden in florid embellishment.\nThus arise the disputes of Confucians and Mohists,\neach affirming what the other denies and denying what the other affirms.\nTo affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms,\nnothing is better than illumination.\n\nSummarizing the above: the Dao and speech are made the subject of discussion—\nwhat is called the \"completed heart\" is the Dao.\nThe great Dao is originally without truth or falsehood—\nwhy is it hidden and thus has truth and falsehood?\nPerfect speech is originally without right or wrong—\nwhy is it obscured and thus has right and wrong?\nWhere has the Dao gone that it does not abide?\nWhy does speech abide yet cannot be relied upon?\nThese are rhetorical questions, answered thus:\nthe Dao is hidden in the arts of minor accomplishments,\nspeech is hidden in superficial and insubstantial doctrines,\nhence the mutual disputes of the Confucian and Mohist schools.\n\nAs the Mohists deem the Confucians wrong, they naturally regard themselves as right. The Confucians, in turn, regard themselves as right and thus deem the Mohists wrong. Each affirms what the other denies and denies what the other affirms—this is the root of the endless disputes between the Confucians and Mohists. To further clarify: rather than striving to affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms, it is better to illumine one’s true master—meaning, to attend to one’s own cultivation and cease idle disputation over right and wrong.\n\nThe preceding passage concludes: \"Human life is inherently thus obscured.\" If I alone am obscured, do others not also suffer the same obscurity? Thus, this passage concludes: \"nothing is better than illumination.\" Illumination means knowing where the true master resides; the obscured do not know this.\n\nThe following two sections reiterate this point, deepening its emphasis. Things are not without their \"that\"; things are not without their \"this.\" From the perspective of \"that,\" one does not see; from the perspective of knowing, one knows. Thus it is said: \"That emerges from this, and this also arises from that.\" This is the doctrine of the mutual arising of \"that\" and \"this.\"\n\nThe previous section spoke only of right and wrong, yet right and wrong truly arise from the opposition of self and other. Thus, this section takes \"that\" and \"this\" as its subject. \"Things are not without their 'that'\" means all things possess self and other—what is \"that\" to me is \"that\" to another, and what is \"I\" to me is \"that\" to another. \"Things are not without their 'this'\" means all things possess right and wrong—what is right to another is \"this\" to me, and what is right to me is \"this\" to another.\n\n\"From the perspective of 'that,' one does not see\" means that from another’s viewpoint, one does not perceive their \"that.\" Why is this so? Because the other regards their \"that\" as \"I,\" and thus does not see it as \"that.\" If the other takes their wrong as right, they do not see what is truly right. \"From the perspective of the self, one knows\" means that from one’s own viewpoint, one perceives the other’s \"that.\" Seeing where the other is not right, one knows what is truly right. This shows that one must not be self-blinded, as others may not know themselves—yet from the self’s perspective, one knows.\n\n\"That emerges from this\" means that my designation of the other as \"that\" and the other’s designation of me as \"that\" both arise from self-affirmation. Thus, when I affirm myself, I ascribe wrong to the other and call them \"that.\" When the other affirms themselves, they ascribe wrong to me and call me \"that.\" \"This also arises from that\" means that my self-affirmation and the other’s self-affirmation both depend on the division between self and other. When I take the other as \"that,\" I necessarily ascribe wrong to them and regard myself as right. When the other takes me as \"that,\" they necessarily ascribe wrong to me and regard themselves as right. Thus, \"that\" and \"this\" arise endlessly.\n\nYet even as they arise, they perish; even as they perish, they arise. Even as they are affirmed, they are denied; even as they are denied, they are affirmed. Though the doctrine of \"that\" and \"this\" arises, it is appended with \"even as they arise,\" followed by a turn: \"though...\" For where there is arising, there is perishing; where there is perishing, there is arising. Where there is affirmation, there is denial; where there is denial, there is affirmation. Viewed through the principle of cyclical recurrence, the doctrine of \"that\" and \"this\" must have a time of cessation, and what now cannot be equalized must have a time when it can.\n\nThus, one follows right because of wrong, and follows wrong because of right. Therefore, the sage does not proceed by this path but illumines it by the heavens—this, too, is following right. For now, one follows their right and wrong, awaiting their natural resolution. It must be reiterated: one follows right because of wrong, and follows wrong because of right. Having followed right, one also follows wrong; having followed wrong, one also follows right. If one follows only one without the other, one remains mired in contention. Thus, the sage does not tread the path of right and wrong but transcends beyond things. Or, if there is right and wrong, one merely illumines it by the heavens—meaning, whether right or wrong, the heavens themselves oversee it. This is also a way of following right. Though it speaks of following right and wrong, it then speaks only of following right—this is an ellipsis. The following text further clarifies the doctrine of following right.\n\n\"This\" is also \"that,\" and \"that\" is also \"this.\" \"That\" has its own right and wrong, and \"this\" has its own right and wrong. Is there truly a \"that\" and \"this\"? Or is there truly no \"that\" and \"this\"? This is the sage’s way of following right. Whatever is \"this\" is also ascribed to \"that,\" and whatever is \"that\" is also taken as \"this.\" Thus, this entirely regards \"that\" as right and acknowledges its own wrong, while that entirely regards this as right and acknowledges its own wrong. Each has its own right and wrong—how, then, can they be divided into \"that\" and \"this\"?\n\nWhen \"that\" and \"this\" find no counterpart, this is called the pivot of the Dao. The pivot attains the center of the ring, responding to the infinite. \"This\" is one infinity, and \"not-this\" is another infinity. When \"that\" and \"this\" do not oppose each other, there is no right and wrong—this is called the pivot of the Dao. Another explanation of the pivot: the pivot is the door’s bolt. Placed at the center of the ring, it cannot be fixed yet opens and closes endlessly. The sage holds the pivot of the Dao and simply listens to the endless right and wrong—this, too, is following right. Thus it is said: \"nothing is better than illumination,\" echoing the earlier conclusion.\n\nTo use a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is not as good as using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. To use a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse. Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.\n\nWhat can be affirmed is affirmed; what cannot be affirmed is not affirmed. The Dao is enacted and becomes; things are named and thus are. How is it so? It is so because it is so. How is it not so? It is not so because it is not so. Things inherently have what they affirm; things inherently have what they accept. There is nothing that is not so; there is nothing that cannot be accepted.\n\nThis follows from the earlier passage on \"what can be affirmed and what cannot be affirmed.\" During the Warring States period, there was a debate over whether a white horse is not a horse—hence the reference. It then turns to the finger on one’s own body to discuss both together.\n\nThis is the finger, yet debaters must insist: using what is not a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is superior to using the class of fingers to illustrate that it is not a finger. This is the horse, yet debaters must insist: using what is not a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is superior to using the class of horses to illustrate that it is not a horse.\n\nIf heaven and earth are combined into one finger, then what people call a \"finger\" is no longer a finger. If the myriad things are summed into one horse, then what people call a \"horse\" is no longer a horse. From a perspective of attachment, one must regard a finger as a finger and a horse as a horse. From a perspective free of attachment, heaven and earth may be called a finger, and the myriad things may be called a horse. Thus, one must not cling to assertions of right and wrong. One should simply affirm what can be affirmed and reject what cannot be affirmed.\n\nThe Dao originally has no name; people enact it and thus establish the name of the Dao. Things originally have no name; people designate them and thus establish the names of things. Therefore, what is \"so\" and what is \"not so\" are merely human impositions. To affirm what is affirmed and deny what is denied is acceptable. Though things inherently possess their own principles—what is \"so\" and what is \"acceptable\" are also viewed as such—then nothing is not so, and nothing is unacceptable.\n\nHere, *duan di* (端的) means \"principle\" or \"definite basis.\" Thus, consider the examples of the rafter and the pillar, the ugly *Li* and the beautiful *Xishi*, the vast and the strange—all are united through the Dao. The rafter (*ting*) is the beam of a house; the pillar (*ying*) stands on the east and west sides of the hall. *Li* is an ugly person; *Xishi* is a beautiful one. The rafter lies horizontally while the pillar stands vertically; *Li* is hideous while *Xishi* is lovely. Though their forms are strange and varied, all are united through the Dao.\n\nTheir division is their completion; their completion is their destruction. All things are neither completed nor destroyed, for they return to unity. Their division is their fragmentation. What some regard as completion may be destruction for others. Thus, all things are neither completed nor destroyed; when reversed and united, they are but one. If one observes only from the perspective of completion, one does not see destruction. If one observes only from the perspective of destruction, one does not see completion. Observing the cycle of completion and destruction, one sees that completion may become destruction, and destruction may become completion—yet in reality, they are one.\n\nOnly the enlightened know that all is united, and thus they do not force their views but lodge them in the ordinary. The ordinary (*yong*) is use; use is unity; unity is attainment. Attaining this is near the subtlety of the Dao. Proceeding thus, acting without knowing why it is so—this is called the Dao.\n\nThe enlightened know that all is united, so they do not impose their views but lodge them in practical affairs. Lodging in practical affairs is use; use is unity. Unity is attainment in the heart. Having attained this, one approaches the Dao. This is what is meant by \"proceeding thus.\" Acting habitually without knowing why—this is called the Dao.\n\nTo exhaust one’s spirit in forcing unity without recognizing their sameness is called \"morning three.\" What is \"morning three\"? It is said: The monkey keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, \"Three in the morning and four in the evening.\" All the monkeys were angry. He then said, \"Very well, four in the morning and three in the evening.\" All the monkeys were pleased. The substance remained unchanged, yet joy and anger were employed—this, too, proceeds from the same principle.\n\nThus, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the evenness of heaven—this is called \"walking two paths.\" Those who labor their minds with one-sided views do not understand unity. Like the monkeys, who were unaware of their own reactions, the keeper accommodated their desires without altering the substance—this, too, follows the principle of \"proceeding thus.\" Therefore, the sage affirms what is affirmed and denies what is denied, harmonizing them so there is no contention and all rests in the balance of heaven’s principle. This is called \"walking two paths without contradiction.\"\n\nThe knowledge of the ancients reached its utmost. To what extent? To the point of believing there had never been any things—this is the utmost, the ultimate, beyond which nothing can be added. Next were those who believed things existed but had never been bounded. Next were those who believed boundaries existed but had never been right and wrong. The manifestation of right and wrong is the diminishment of the Dao. The diminishment of the Dao is the formation of attachment.\n\nFollowing the preceding discussion of the sage, we now speak of the ancients. Those who believed there had never been any things were like the *wuji* (the Ultimate of Non-being). To know this is to reach the utmost, the ultimate, beyond which nothing can be added. The *Doctrine of the Mean* also says: \"The workings of Heaven are without sound or scent—this is the utmost.\" If there had never been any things, how could there be right and wrong? Harmonizing right and wrong is the work of later sages; the ancients had no such distinctions. Is there truly completion and diminishment? Is there truly neither completion nor diminishment?\n\nCompletion and diminishment exist, and thus Master Zhao played the zither; completion and diminishment do not exist, and thus Master Zhao did not play the zither. When Master Zhao played the zither, when Music Master Kuang wielded his baton, and when Master Hui leaned against the parasol tree—these three men’s wisdom approached the subtlest point, all reaching their zenith, and thus their deeds were recorded in their later years. Only because they cherished their arts, distinguishing themselves from others, did they cherish them, desiring to make them manifest. Yet what they sought to illuminate was not meant to be illuminated, and so they ended in the obscurity of the \"hard and white\" debate. Moreover, Master Zhao’s son spent his life continuing his father’s legacy, yet in the end achieved nothing. Could this truly be called completion? If so, then I too have completed something; if not, then neither things nor I have ever completed anything. Thus, the radiance within confusion and doubt is what the sage contemplates. To refrain from employing such distinctions while lodging them in the ordinary—this is called \"illumination by means of the Dao.\"\n\n*Wen* was Master Zhao’s given name. *Zhi ce* refers to the baton used to play the zither. *Wu* denotes the parasol tree, from which zithers and lutes are made. *Ji* means \"approaching.\" *Zai* means \"to record.\" *Mo nian* refers to old age. *Lun* signifies \"continuation.\"\n\nTo speak of completion and diminishment: if one assumes their existence, it is like Master Zhao playing the zither; if one assumes their absence, it is like Master Zhao not playing the zither. Let us take Master Zhao’s zither-playing as an example. Master Zhao’s skill, along with that of Music Master Kuang and Master Hui, approached the subtlest point of wisdom, all being consummate masters of their arts. That he could rival Music Master Kuang and Master Hui demonstrates his mastery of the zither. His lifelong dedication to this art stemmed from his deep love for it, desiring to distinguish himself from others. Yet his devotion aimed only to make his art manifest to the world. What he sought to illuminate was not meant to be illuminated, and so he ended in obscurity, like the \"hard and white\" debate, which begins with clarity but ends in confusion. Master Zhao achieved no true completion, and his son, who spent his life continuing his father’s work, likewise found no one to appreciate his art. From this perspective, had Master Zhao never learned to play the zither, how could there have been completion or diminishment? Only because he loved playing the zither did completion and diminishment arise. If we judge by present appearances: if such dedication can be called completion, then I too have completed something; if not, then neither things nor I have ever completed anything. Thus, within the confusion and doubt that obscures all distinctions, there lies a radiance—the very thing the sage contemplates. To refrain from employing such distinctions while lodging them in the ordinary is what is meant by \"illumination by means of the Dao.\"\n\nHere ends the second scroll of the *Xunben* edition of the *True Classic of Southern Florescence*.\nHere begins the third scroll of the *Xunben* edition of the *True Classic of Southern Florescence*.\n\nHere begins the *Inner Chapters: On the Equality of Things (Part Two)*, collated by Lu Lingzhu’s disciple Peng Xiang of Bamboo Peak in Luling.\n\nSuppose I now speak of something—how could one know whether it belongs to the same category as this or not? Whether it belongs or does not belong, if both are taken as belonging, then it differs in no way from that. This passage follows from the earlier discussion of \"those who have speech.\"\n\nNow, if we take human speech—whether it resembles this or does not resemble this—all are alike in being speech. If this is deemed right, then that too is deemed right; if this is deemed wrong, then that too is deemed wrong. They are fundamentally alike. Or if this is deemed right while that is deemed wrong, they are still alike in their shared wrongness; if this is deemed wrong while that is deemed right, they are alike in their shared rightness. All are of one category, differing not from the other’s claims and thus beyond contention.\n\nYet let me attempt to speak of it: There is a beginning; there is that which precedes the beginning; there is that which precedes even that which precedes the beginning. There is being; there is non-being; there is that which precedes non-being; there is that which precedes even that which precedes non-being. Suddenly there is being and non-being, yet one cannot know which of the two truly is or is not. Now I have something to say, yet I do not know whether what I call it truly has meaning or truly has no meaning.\n\nLet me attempt to speak of it, let me try to speak of it. What was spoken before was human speech; what I now say is my own speech. Yet, taking another turn, if we examine the origins of Heaven and Earth and the myriad things, there was neither being nor non-being, nor even the absence of non-being. The discourse of being and non-being arose only in later ages. Thus, human speech is not to be relied upon, nor is my own speech truly meaningful.\n\nIn all the world, nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; nothing lives longer than a child who dies young, yet Peng Zu is short-lived. Heaven and Earth are born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one. Since we are already one, how could there be speech? Since we have already called it one, how could there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. Proceeding thus, even the most skilled mathematician cannot arrive at a sum—how much less the ordinary person? Therefore, from non-being to being, reaching three, how much more so from being to being? There is no need to proceed further; let it rest here.\n\nThe tip of an autumn hair is inherently small, yet if we say the tip of an autumn hair cannot be further divided, it may be called great. Beyond Mount Tai, there are still greater things, so it may be called small. A child who dies young is inherently short-lived, yet if we name it as such, it has lived its years, so it may be called long-lived. Beyond Peng Zu, there are still longer-lived beings, so he may be called short-lived. But when viewed through Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, there are no distinctions. Human life begins with a body that already contains a Heaven and Earth. Thus, Heaven and Earth are born together with me. There is nothing among the myriad things that is not so—thus, the myriad things and I are one body. What distinction is there between small and great, long-lived and short-lived?\n\nSince we are one, there is no room for speech. If one insists on speaking of \"one,\" then speech proliferates, and right and wrong become endless. Therefore, one should return to the origin of emptiness and non-being, resting in what is so—this responds to the earlier \"let it rest here.\"\n\nThe Dao has never had boundaries; speech has never had constancy. Yet for the sake of this, distinctions arise. Here, the Dao and speech are set in contrast to boundaries, further refining the notion of limits.\n\nLet me speak of these boundaries: there is left and right, there are ranks and principles, there are divisions and debates, there are competitions and contentions. These are called the eight virtues. *Ranks* refer to order; *principles* refer to appropriateness. Having established order, one must also ensure that each matter is fitting. *Divisions* refer to distinctions; *debates* refine them further. *Competition* pertains to the mind, while *contention* pertains to force. As the *Zuo Tradition* says: \"Not competing in mind but contending in force.\"\n\nBeyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss; within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not deliberate; regarding the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the intentions of the former kings, the sage deliberates but does not debate. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records the intentions of the former kings—it is a historical text. In the *Rites of Zhou*, the lesser scribe is charged with the records of the state. Thus, Heaven and Earth, past and present, are all that the sage does not speak of. *Deliberation* is more detailed than *discussion*; *debate* is more detailed than *deliberation*.\n\nTherefore, where there are divisions, there are also non-divisions; where there are debates, there are also non-debates. One asks: Why? The sage embraces them.\n\nThe scroll is to be stored away. The multitude debate it to display to one another. Thus it is said: in debate, there are things unseen. One seeks to see them yet paradoxically does not.\n\nThe great Dao is not named; great disputation does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest—*qiàn* (慊) here means \"to be sated with things,\" implying the heart’s attachment to them. Some are sated with satisfaction and sufficiency, others with resentment and lack. This speaks of how great integrity does not take integrity as self-sufficiency. Great courage does not harm.\n\nWhen the Dao is made manifest, it ceases to be the Dao; when words are debated, they fall short; when benevolence is constant, it fails to achieve completion; when one relies on courage to harm others, it is no longer the true Dao. To display it is to render it insufficient as the Dao. To debate it is to leave gaps unaddressed. Confined by habitual attachments, benevolence becomes limited and fails to fulfill its nature. Integrity, though pure, is not trusted—self-proclaimed purity cannot win others’ faith. Courage, when used to harm, does not achieve greatness.\n\nThese five, when rounded, nearly approach the square. *Rounded* (圆) means circular, adaptable. The great Dao is not named, and great courage does not seek gratification. These five principles are fundamentally fluid and natural; when the Dao is made manifest, it ceases to be the Dao, and when courage harms, it fails to achieve greatness. Yet if these five are rigidly adhered to, they nearly become square.\n\nThus, to know where to stop in what one does not know is perfection. Who knows the disputation of the unspeaking, the Dao of the unspoken? If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Treasury. It may be drawn from without ever being exhausted, poured from without ever being depleted, yet one knows not whence it comes—this is called *preserving illumination*. *Preserving* (葆) means to nurture. Before understanding this principle, one says: \"Nothing compares to clarity.\" Once this principle is grasped, one nurtures its radiance.\n\nThis passage is divided into five sections: the first concludes with *obscurity* (芒), the second, third, and fourth with *clarity* (以明), and the fifth with *preserving illumination* (葆光). *Obscurity* is the reverse of clarity, yet both are forms of brilliance. The general meaning is that externally, one follows what is so, while internally, one naturally illuminates the truth. Thus, the phrase \"follow what is so\" appears five times, while \"clarity\" appears three.\n\nTherefore, in ancient times, Yao asked Shun: \"I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when I face south, I feel unsettled. What is the reason?\" Shun replied: \"Those three rulers still dwell among the brambles and reeds. Why do you feel unsettled? In the past, when ten suns appeared together, all things were illuminated—how much more so for virtue that surpasses the sun?\" Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao were three states. Zong was one, Kuai two, and Xu’ao three. The \"three rulers\" were the lords of these states. *Still* (犹) means \"yet\"; *dwell* (存) means \"to be present\"; *you* (若) means \"you.\" These three rulers, secluded in remote places, had not yet witnessed the transformative power of virtue, like being concealed among overgrown weeds. What cause is there for resentment? One should instead return to one’s own virtue. Even the sun has places it cannot illuminate; when ten suns shine together, nothing is left unlit. How much more so for virtue’s illumination, which far exceeds the sun’s? Though these three states are remote, they will eventually cut through the brambles and thorns to come and submit—why attack them?\n\nNie Que asked Wang Ni: According to the *Biographies of Lofty Scholars*, Wang Ni was a worthy man of Yao’s time. The *Heaven and Earth* chapter states he was Nie Que’s teacher. \"Do you know what all things agree upon as right?\" He replied:\n\n\"How could I know this? Then are things without knowledge?\" He replied: \"How could I know this? Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it: How can one be certain that what I call knowing is not not-knowing? How can one be certain that what I call not-knowing is not knowing? Now let me ask you this: When people sleep in damp places, they suffer from lower back pain or partial paralysis—is this not so? Yet loaches do not. When dwelling in trees, one trembles with fear—is this not so? Yet monkeys do not. Which of these three knows the proper place to dwell? People eat domesticated animals; deer eat grass. Centipedes relish snakes; owls delight in mice. Which of these four knows the proper taste? Apes mate with gibbons; deer couple with elk; loaches swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Lady Li were considered beauties by men, yet fish dive deep at the sight of them, birds soar high, and deer flee in haste. Which of these four knows the proper beauty of the world? From my perspective, the distinctions of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and confused. How could I discern their distinctions?\"\n\nNie Que said: \"If you do not know benefit and harm, does the perfected person truly not know benefit and harm?\" Nie Que took Wang Ni to be a perfected person, so he found it strange that he did not know.\n\nWang Ni replied: \"The perfected person is divine. Great marshes may burn, yet they cannot be made hot; rivers and lakes may freeze, yet they cannot be made cold. Lightning may split mountains, winds may shake the seas, yet they cannot be startled. One such as this rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas. Life and death do not alter them—how much less the distinctions of benefit and harm!\"\n\nJu Quezi asked Chang Wuzi: \"I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in worldly affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Way, is not constrained by adherence to the Way, speaks without speaking, and speaks of what is without speech. The Master considered these careless words, but I regard them as the practice of the wondrous Way. What do you think?\"\n\nChang Wuzi replied: \"Even the Yellow Emperor would have found this enlightening to hear, yet how could one like Qiu (Chang Wuzi’s name) comprehend it? Moreover, you are too hasty in your calculations—seeing an egg and demanding a rooster to crow at dawn, seeing a slingshot and craving roasted quail. Let me speak to you recklessly, and you may listen recklessly—how about that? Abiding by the sun and moon, embracing the cosmos, aligning the harmonious, setting aside the slippery and confused, and serving with reverence. The masses toil endlessly, while the sage appears foolish and dull, blending the myriad ages into a single purity. All things are thus, and this is how they are enfolded within one another. How do I know that delighting in life is not delusion? How do I know that hating death is not like a youth lost and unable to find his way home?\"\n\nThe Lady of Li was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. Though not from the Li Rong tribe, she was still subject to the custom where men were esteemed and women held cheap. When the state of Jin first acquired her, she wept until her tears soaked her collar. Yet once she arrived at the royal court, sharing the king’s bed and feasting on fine meats, she came to regret her tears.\n\nHow do I know that the dead do not regret their former toil for life? One who dreams of drinking wine may wake weeping; one who dreams of weeping may wake to go hunting. In the midst of a dream, one does not know it is a dream. Within the dream, one may even interpret the dream—only upon waking does one realize it was a dream. And only with great awakening does one know that all this was a great dream. Yet fools believe themselves awake, priding themselves on their knowledge: \"Are you a lord? A herdsman?\"—thus dividing noble and base. How rigid! How shallow!\n\nI and you are both dreaming—what I call your dream is also a dream. Even this discourse is a dream. Such words are called *diaogui*—utterly strange. Should a great sage arise in ten thousand generations to unravel this, it would be as if encountering him at dawn or dusk. To speak of ten thousand generations as dawn and dusk is to say such a one is rare—perhaps never to appear. Yet if he were to arise after ten thousand generations, it would still be as near as dawn or dusk.\n\nIf you and I were to debate, and you prevailed over me, or I over you—would you truly be right and I wrong? Or I right and you wrong? Or might we both be right, or both wrong? You and I cannot know. Others are likewise shrouded in darkness. How could we entrust judgment to another? If we sought one who agrees with you to decide, how could they judge fairly, being of your mind? If we sought one who agrees with me, how could they judge fairly, being of my mind? If we sought one who differs from both of us, how could they judge fairly, being unlike us? If we sought one who agrees with both of us, how could they judge fairly, being like us? Thus, neither you, nor I, nor others can know—must we await that sage of ten thousand generations?\n\nWhat does it mean to harmonize with the *tianni*?\n\nQuquezi posed the question, for this too is a common expression among Daoists.\n\nLongwuzi replied: \"Is\" is not \"is,\" \"not\" is not \"not.\" If \"is\" were truly \"is,\" then its difference from \"not-is\" would require no debate. If \"so\" were truly \"so,\" then its difference from \"not-so\" would require no debate. In all matters, one should affirm what others deny; in all words, one should assent to what others reject. If what I affirm is truly affirmed, then this matter is settled—other matters, though denied, need not be contested for their difference. If what I assent to is truly assented to, then this word is settled—other words, though rejected, need not be contested for their difference.\n\nTransforming voices depend on one another, yet seem not to depend. *Huasheng*—like the \"influence of culture\" in books, or the \"voice of benevolence\" Mencius spoke of—refers to those who await instruction to be transformed. How much finer to be transformed without awaiting instruction! To be free of debate is already excellent; to be free even of voice is yet a higher level.\n\nTo harmonize with the *tianni*: *Tian* means \"natural,\" *ni* means \"incipience.\" The moment a beginning emerges, it arises from the naturalness of *tian*, without awaiting its full manifestation—this is called harmonizing with the *tianni*. To follow this with *manyan*—with wandering and unfolding.\n\nTo exhaust one’s years thus—\nForgetting age, forgetting rightness,\none stirs into the boundless,\nand so abides in the boundless.\n*Stirs*: to arise.\n*Abides*: to rest.\n*Boundless*: the limitless.\nArising in the limitless, one rests in the limitless.\n\n*Wangliang* asked the shadow, saying—\n*Wangliang*: the faint darkness beyond the shadow, what was earlier called the shadow’s shadow.\nIt hovers indistinctly, as if there were a middle between it and the shadow, hence the name *wangliang*.\n“Just now you were walking, now you are still;\njust now you were sitting, now you rise.\nWhy are you so lacking in constancy?”\n\nThe shadow replied:\n“Do I depend on something to be thus?\nWhat I depend on is form.\nDoes what I depend on in turn depend on something else to be thus?\nThe movement of form—something else causes it to be so.\nDo I depend on the snake’s belly-scales or the cicada’s wings?\nThe snake moves by its belly-scales, the cicada flies by its wings—yet once these creatures shed their forms, they become shapes that can neither walk nor fly.\nThe form I depend on is like the snake’s scales or the cicada’s wings: once the spirit departs, it can no longer move of itself.\nHow could I know why it is so, or why it is not so?\n\nWhen people speak of what is so and what is not so, it is like form.\nMy being so or not so is like the shadow.\nAnd what makes it so or not so is like form, which cannot know its own movement or stillness—how then could I know it?\n\nOnce, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering and flitting about, a butterfly indeed.\nHe felt himself following its joy—was it not so?\nYet he did not know it was Zhou.”\n\nSuddenly he awoke—startled, bewildered, as if roused from a trance. It was Zhou. Yet how could he know whether Zhou had dreamed he was a butterfly, or the butterfly now dreamed it was Zhou? Waking is but another dream, and thus it seemed the butterfly’s dream had become Zhou. Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. Yet if Zhou and the butterfly cannot know their own division, how could one discern the boundary between this and that, self and other? This is called the transformation of things.\n\nThis is the principle of the myriad things’ transformation: when one contemplates the metamorphosis of things, one sees that they need not be equal. This chapter is titled \"Equalizing Things,\" and thus concludes by returning to the word *thing*.\n\nThe second chapter of the *Nanhua* is widely deemed difficult to read. Here it is divided into three major sections: from Nan Guo Ziqi sitting with his back to the desk to *\"this is how they come into being\"* forms the first section, which itself contains three subsections—first, the dialogue between the master and disciple in their confusion; next, the earthly pipes; and finally, the heavenly pipes. From *\"without that, there is no self\"* to *\"this is called preserving one’s inner light\"* forms the second section, which contains five subsections—first, following Ziqi’s discourse on the heavenly pipes, it speaks of man’s inherent true master yet his ignorance of it; the subsequent subsections largely excerpt Gongsun Long’s paradoxes: the second on affirmation and negation, the third on right and wrong, the fourth on self and other, and the fifth on *\"not the finger\"* and *\"not the horse.\"* The conclusion is that nothing surpasses silence. From *\"Yao questioned Shun\"* to the end forms the third section, serving only to cite evidence in support of the preceding section’s meaning, arranged as in the previous chapter. It contains four subsections: the first speaks of virtue advancing beyond the sun to clarify the earlier exposition; the second speaks of the perfected person transcending life and death, and thus beyond right and wrong; the third speaks of the Dao as needing no cultivation, and thus beyond right and wrong; the fourth and fifth offer two analogies, showing that even within the human body there are things one cannot know—how then could one know right and wrong? Thus, one can only listen to the inequality of things and equalize them.\n\nHere ends the third scroll of the *Xunben* edition of the *True Classic of Nanhua*.\nHere begins the fourth scroll of the *Xunben* edition of the *True Classic of Nanhua*.\n\nLululing Bamboo Peak’s Luo Miandao, as recorded by his disciple Peng Xiang, collated and punctuated\n\n**Inner Chapters: The Pivot of Nurturing Life**\nThis chapter speaks of the pivot of nurturing life. It first states that nurturing life must accord with its natural course; later, it states that though one speaks of nurturing life, one should in truth regard death and life as one.\n\nOur life is bounded, yet knowledge is boundless. To pursue the boundless with the bounded is perilous; and to do so in the name of knowledge is perilous indeed.\n\nIn doing good, do not seek fame; in doing evil, do not court punishment. Follow the central path as your constant guide—thus can you preserve the body, fulfill life, nurture kin, and live out your years.\n\n*Near* means to draw close. *Follow* means to accord. *Supervisor* refers to the center, as the seam down the back of a garment is called the *du*; this is the sense intended here. Those who do good inevitably gain renown; those who do evil inevitably incur punishment. To nurture life well is to relinquish knowledge and forget both good and evil. Thus, in doing good, one does not draw near to fame’s allure; in doing evil, one does not draw near to punishment’s harm. For without the pursuit of good or evil, one naturally transcends the confines of punishment and reputation.\n\nYet do not cling to the center as a rigid rule. The *center* of which Laozi speaks—embracing the One and guarding the center—does not mean straddling the middle between good and evil. Zhu Xi, in his postscript to the *Supreme Polarity Discourse*, criticizes this interpretation, though it may not reflect the original intent.\n\nCook Ding, carving an ox for Lord Wenhui of Liang (King Hui of Liang), offers an analogy for nurturing life. Where his hand touches, where his shoulder leans—his strength applied, his shoulder tilts. Where his foot treads, where his knee presses (the sound *ji*, as the knee braces)—*huo!* (a crisp sound), the blade enters with a *xiang* (resonant rush), and the knife slices with a *huo* (sharp crack).\n\nThe *xu* sound—still a faint resonance, yet audible. The *huo* sound, however, is loud and clear. As the blade moves in rhythm, it is as though playing music, every stroke attuned to harmony. It matches the dance of *Sanglin*, and aligns with the cadence of *Lishou*. The *Zuozhuan* annotates: *Sanglin* was the music of the Shang sovereigns. The *Record of Rites* states: feudal lords used *Lishou* as their rhythmic measure. It further notes: *Lishou xu*—the moment when music converges. And again: feudal lords timed their audiences with the Son of Heaven to this measure. These two musical pieces are invoked because Tang prayed at *Sanglin*, offering himself as sacrifice, while the feudal lords sang *Lishou* in archery rites to rebuke those who failed to attend court. Both hold meaning for the art of ox-carving.\n\nLord Wenhui exclaimed, *\"Xi!\"*—a sigh of admiration—\"How sublime! Has skill ever reached such heights?\" Cook Ding laid down his blade and replied: \"Your servant pursues the *Dao*, advancing beyond mere technique. When I first began carving oxen, all I saw was the whole beast. After three years, I no longer saw the ox entire. Now, I encounter it with spirit rather than sight; my senses halt while my spirit moves. The eye’s office governs vision. I follow the natural pattern—*tian* as spontaneity, *li* as the inherent grain. The ox’s body possesses a natural structure; I cleave along its lines. I strike the great gaps (*pi* the wide fissures), guide the blade through the spacious hollows (*kuan*), and proceed as its fixed nature dictates. I have never touched the sinew-bound joints (*jing qing*), let alone the great bones (*gu*). A skilled cook replaces his knife yearly—he only cuts flesh. An ordinary cook changes his blade monthly—he hacks bone and dulls the edge. My knife has endured nineteen years—nineteen, a number accumulating to unity—and has carved thousands of oxen, yet its edge remains as if newly whetted from the grindstone. The blade’s edge is razor-thin, while the joints have space. To enter the space with what has no thickness—how vast the room for the blade’s play! Thus, after nineteen years, my knife is still as if newly sharpened. Yet whenever I encounter a dense cluster of bones, I perceive the difficulty, grow wary, fix my gaze, slow my movements, and move the blade with utmost care. Then—*huo!*—the ox falls apart like clods of earth. I stand holding the knife, look around in satisfaction, linger with self-assurance, then wipe the blade clean and put it away.\"\n\nLord Wenhui said, \"Excellent! From Cook Ding’s words, I have learned the art of nurturing life.\" Here, the discourse takes another turn: though my knife-work is indeed refined, whenever I reach a dense cluster, I recognize the challenge and dare not grow complacent. My former reliance on spirit rather than sight now sharpens into focused attention; my once-fluid motion slows to deliberate care; my blade’s effortless play becomes a movement of utmost precision. Only when the ox dissolves—*huo!*—like earth crumbling to the ground do I stand holding the knife, survey the scene with an unoccupied gaze, pause in quiet triumph, then tend to the blade and store it away. How different is the Way of nurturing life from this? Gongwen Xuan...\n\nGongwen Xuan was a native of Song. Upon seeing the Right Minister—a position held in the Song court alongside the Left Minister—he exclaimed in astonishment, \"What manner of man is this? How came he to be one-legged? Is this a natural deformity, or the result of punishment?\" For to be one-legged was to be maimed, as in the case of Sun Bin. \"Was this fate’s decree, or man’s doing?\" he wondered. Then he answered himself: \"It was Heaven, not man. Heaven’s creation made him thus solitary; man’s form is meant to be paired. From this we know it was Heaven’s work, not man’s.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Man is born with two feet; that he now has but one is Heaven’s doing. To suffer such a fate is simply the course of destiny—nothing more than Heaven’s will.\"\n\nA marsh pheasant takes ten steps to peck, a hundred steps to drink, yet it does not seek to be kept in a cage. Though its spirit may thrive, it finds no goodness in confinement. The pheasant in the marsh drinks and pecks at ease, never desiring the nourishment of a cage. Yet if caged, though its vitality may be preserved, it remains constrained—this is not true well-being. What matter if one is one-legged? But to serve as Right Minister, bound by office, is to court disaster. This is to lose the Way of nurturing life.\n\nWhen Lao Dan died, Qin Shi went to offer condolences. He wailed three times and departed. A disciple asked, \"Was he not your master’s friend?\" \"He was,\" Qin Shi replied. The disciple pressed, \"Then is such brief mourning proper?\" Qin Shi answered, \"At first, I thought him a true man, but now I see he was not.\" He referred to Lao Dan. \"At first, I took him for one of Lao Dan’s disciples, but now I see he was not—he was still entangled in worldly sentiment.\"\n\n\"When I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping as if for a son, and youths wailing as if for a mother. In their gathering, there must have been those who spoke without seeking to speak, who wept without seeking to weep. This is to flee from Heaven and betray one’s true nature, to forget what one has received—what the ancients called ‘the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.’ To gather and be moved thus is to flee from the principles of Heaven, to violate one’s true feelings, and to forget the destiny one is born with. In the ancient age of emptiness and tranquility, such behavior would be deemed a transgression against Heaven, a fault in the rites of mourning.\"\n\n\"When he came, the Master followed the time; when he departed, the Master followed the flow. To dwell in accord with the time and abide in the natural course is to remain untouched by joy or sorrow—what the ancients called ‘the celestial release.’ Life arrives as the time comes; death departs as the time flows. To accept the time is to find no excess in life’s joy; to follow the flow is to find no lack in death’s sorrow. The ‘celestial release’ refers to Heaven’s workings through yin and yang, the Five Phases, giving rise to all things. Man receives these at birth, bound by joy and anger, sorrow and happiness, fortune and misfortune, regret and blame—all that entangles him. Yet if one dwells in accord with the time and abides in the natural course, sorrow and joy cannot enter, and the bonds of Heaven are loosed.\"\n\n\"The men of old were thus, which is why Qin Shi wailed but three times before departing. A finger may trace the length of firewood, but the firewood is boundless while the finger is finite. Yet when the fire is passed from one to the next, its end is unknown. This is another parable to illustrate the principle of life and death. No man is immortal—why then grieve excessively?\"\n\nThe preceding sections spoke of nurturing life; this one speaks of viewing life and death as one. To see life and death as one is the very essence of nurturing life. Those who study the Way should take this as the foundation of their practice.\n\n*Thus concludes the fourth scroll of the Xunben edition of the Nan Hua True Classic. The fifth scroll follows.*\n\nBamboo Peak of Lulin, recorded by Luo Miandao, collated by disciple Peng Xiang\n\n**Inner Chapters: The Human World**\n\nHow could one soar high and flee far to escape the human world? Thus this chapter expounds the Way of dwelling in the human world.\n\nYan Hui sought an audience with Confucius and requested leave to depart.\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Confucius.\n\"To the state of Wei.\"\n\"What will you do there?\"\nHui replied: \"I have heard that the lord of Wei, Duke Chu, is in his prime, yet his conduct is willful. He treats his state lightly and fails to perceive his faults. He squanders the lives of his people, and the dead are measured by the land as if they were reeds in the marsh—so numerous that the people have nowhere to turn.\"\n\n*Quantified as if by measure. Marshes like Yunmeng. Reeds, a kind of grass. The dead are so vast that, measured against the land, the people perish like grass in the marsh.*\n\nChen Feng Hua said: \"I am daily worn down by war, bones lie exposed like wild grass, and the people have nowhere to turn. They move and are ensnared by punishments, with no escape.\"\n\nHui continued: \"I once heard you say, Master, that one should leave well-governed states and go to those in chaos. The gate of a physician sees many illnesses—just as a physician desires many illnesses to practice his craft, so too may one practice the Way in a disordered state. I wish to ponder the principles I have heard from you and consider their application, that perhaps Wei may yet be cured.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Alas! You are likely to go and be executed. The Way does not tolerate杂乱.杂乱 leads to excess, excess to disturbance, disturbance to anxiety, and anxiety cannot be remedied.\n\nThe perfected ones of old first established it within themselves before extending it to others. If what is established within yourself is not yet settled, how can you attend to the conduct of a violent man?\n\nMoreover, do you know where virtue is eroded and whence knowledge arises? Virtue is eroded by fame, and knowledge arises from contention. Fame is a means of mutual conflict; knowledge is an instrument of strife. Both are inauspicious tools, not to be employed in all circumstances.\n\nThough your virtue be profound and your trust unshakable, if you have not yet aligned with the people’s qi, and though your fame be uncontentious, if you have not yet reached their hearts—\n\n*Profound trust resides in one’s qi, hence it is said not yet aligned with the people’s qi. Non-contention resides in the heart’s intent, hence it is said not yet reached their hearts.*\n\n—if you forcibly present the language of仁义 and the墨绳 of standards before a violent man, you will make others resent what they perceive as your superiority. This is called *disaster-bringing*. One who brings disaster to others will surely have disaster reflected back upon them.\"\n\nShould you bring disaster upon others, you court peril for yourself.\n\nMoreover, if you merely delight in the worthy and despise the unworthy, why seek to distinguish yourself thus? If you, without instruction, remain silent, lords and princes will surely exploit others to vie for advantage, and their eyes will dazzle you—your vision will be confounded by their glare. Their countenance will level you—your expression will harmonize with theirs. Their mouths will entangle you—they will justify themselves in self-defense. Your demeanor will mirror theirs—adopting the posture of one struck and kneeling. Your heart will conform to theirs—thus solidifying their wrongdoing. This is like quenching fire with fire, or flood with flood—it is called *adding to the excess*. Unable to correct, you only compound the error. To follow their beginning without end is perilous; if you speak earnestly yet without credibility, you will surely perish before the violent.\n\nThey follow their own beginnings—how could their malice ever reach an end? If you admonish them, they will surely deem your words untrustworthy. Enraged by your sincerity, you will not escape punishment or execution.\n\nOf old, Jie slew Guan Longfeng, and Zhou slew Prince Bigan—both had cultivated their persons, humbling themselves to soothe the people, yet in doing so defied their superiors. Thus, their rulers punished them for their cultivation. These were men who prized fame.\n\nIn ancient times, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xu’ao, and Yu attacked Youhu. Their states became desolate ruins—*xu* means dwellings left empty; *li* means those who die without heirs. Their bodies were executed, their wars unceasing, their pursuit of substance insatiable. These were men who sought fame and substance.\n\nHave you alone not heard of this? Fame and substance are what even the sages cannot fully master—how much less can one like you! Cong, Zhi, Xu’ao sought to contend with Yao for fame and substance; Youhu sought to contend with Yu for fame and substance. Even Yao and Yu could not endure them and so attacked—how much less can you!\n\nYet if you must have some means, come and speak to me.\n\nYan Hui said: \"If I am upright yet empty, diligent yet single-minded—would that suffice?\"\nThe Master said: \"How could it? How could that suffice?\nWhen one’s yang-qi swells to overflowing brilliance, when one’s countenance shifts without constancy—this is what ordinary men dare not oppose. Following and pressing upon what moves others, one seeks to indulge the heart’s desires. Such is called the virtue of gradual accumulation, yet even this cannot be achieved—how much less the great virtue!\nOne will remain obstinate and unyielding, outwardly compliant yet inwardly uncritical. How could this ever suffice?\nUprightness and humility serve to exhaust one’s own capacities; diligence and single-mindedness serve to enter into others.\nWhen one’s yang-qi swells to overflowing brilliance, it means the Lord of Wei, taking his yang-nature as self-sufficient, acts with unbounded self-satisfaction. When his countenance shifts without constancy, it means his joy and anger have no fixed pattern, so no one dares oppose him. *An* is the same as *pressing*; *gan* means *to touch*. *Rong-yu* means *unrestrained indulgence*. Thus, following and pressing upon what touches him, he seeks to indulge his heart’s desires.\nThis is called the virtue of gradual accumulation, yet even this cannot be achieved—how much less the great virtue!\n*Obstinate* means *unyielding*. *Zi* means *to slander*. He will remain obstinate and unyielding, while you must outwardly comply yet inwardly cease to criticize him. In that case, what you call upright yet empty, diligent yet single-minded—how could this suffice? Outward compliance without inward criticism is precisely what was earlier called *indulging and shaping the heart’s desires*.\nThus, I am inwardly straight yet outwardly yielding, achieving and aligning above.\n*Inwardly straight* means *to follow Heaven as one’s companion*. One who follows Heaven as his companion knows that the Son of Heaven and himself are both children of Heaven. Does he alone seek that others praise his words, or that others condemn them? One who acts thus is called a childlike man. This is what it means to follow Heaven as one’s companion.\nYan Hui further spoke of these three principles: *Inwardly straight yet outwardly yielding* means to be direct within yet accommodating without; *achieving and aligning above* means to present one’s achievements and align them with the ancients. Being inwardly direct is to follow one’s Heavenly nature. Thus it is said...\"\n\nTo follow Heaven as one’s companion is to know that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven. Both are but children—how could one surpass the other and seek alone that others follow one’s own words? Would this not mean that one has surpassed even the Son of Heaven? If one can grasp this principle and not seek to prevail through one’s own judgments, then one remains whole. This is the intent of Heaven in treating all as its children. Thus it is said: one who acts thus is called a childlike man. To be like a child is to remain in a time before right and wrong are divided. This is what it means to follow Heaven as one’s companion.\n\nTo be outwardly yielding is to follow others as one’s companions. Bowing, kneeling, and curving one’s hands—these are the rites of a minister. If all others do so, how dare I refuse? To do what others do is to leave no room for blame. This is what it means to follow others as one’s companions. To be outwardly accommodating is to navigate human affairs with flexibility. Thus it is said: to follow others as one’s companions.\n\nTo achieve and align above is to follow the ancients as one’s companions. Though one’s words may instruct, their truth belongs to the ancients, not to oneself. If one acts thus, though direct, one does no harm. This is what it means to follow the ancients as one’s companions. To present the ancients’ established sayings is to speak not merely as recitation or instruction, but as admonition. For these are the offices of the ancients, not one’s own. Thus, though direct, one avoids causing harm. This is what it means to follow the ancients as one’s companions.\n\nIs this then acceptable?\nConfucius said: Alas, how could it be! There are too many policies and laws, yet no deliberation. One cannot interpose deliberation into them. Though steadfast, one remains blameless. Yet this is all there is to it—how could it reach the transformation of one who still follows his own mind? This is still to take one’s own mind as one’s teacher.\n\nYan Hui said: I have no further way forward. May I ask the method?\nConfucius said: Fast, and I will tell you. To act while possessing—is this easy? Those who find it easy are not favored by the August Heaven.\n\nYan Hui said: \"Hui’s family is poor. For months now, I have neither drunk wine nor eaten meat. If this is so, may I consider it fasting?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"This is the fast of sacrificial rites, not the fast of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui said: \"May I ask about the fast of the mind?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind but listen with qi. Listening stops at the ears, the mind stops at the tally. Qi is that which is empty and awaits things. The tally is what is called one’s nature. As Yang Xiong said in *Da Bin Xi*: 'Be cautious in cultivating your will, guard and observe the celestial tally.' This speaks of nature and the celestial tally, hence it is called the tally. Like a tally or contract, hearing sound stops at the ears, thought stops at the tally. Only qi has no thought—it is merely empty and awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fast of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui said: \"Before I had begun to be employed, I was truly myself. Once employed, I would no longer be myself. If I do not know the Dao, then my hundred limbs would have no one to obey. Truly, this is one—once Yan Hui attains the Dao, there is only emptiness. How could this body remain? Can this be called emptiness?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"You have exhausted it. I will tell you! If you can enter and wander within its enclosure without being moved by its name—entering, then speak; not entering, then stop. Without gate, without harm, dwelling in one abode and lodging in inevitability—then you are near. Take birds as an analogy: the state of Wei is like a cage for its ruler, the dragon. Yan Hui wishes to go to Wei, as if entering a cage. But if you enter and wander within the state without being moved by its illustrious name, this is called 'entering and wandering.' Though you enter, you retain the meaning of roaming freely, not constrained by circumstance. If you gain entry, then admonish; if you do not, then stop—there is no need to insist on entry. Yet if you do enter, consider the way of dwelling: Wei is not a place where one should reside. Without a single gate that is not harmful, you may only secure one dwelling and lodge this body in inevitability. To lodge is to reside without attachment. If you do this, you will be near to the Lord of Wei. 'Near' means close. This is to instruct Yan Hui on how to enter, dwell, and wait—remaining long enough to transform naturally. What follows is the way to effect that transformation.\n\nTo erase traces is easy; to walk without treading is difficult. It is easy for one to erase their tracks, but how can one not tread at all? To be employed by man is easy to feign; to be employed by Heaven is difficult to feign. Though human affairs contain the principles of Heaven, man may be deceived, but Heaven cannot. These four lines speak of Yan Hui’s need to efface his form and traces, and discard superficial falsity.\n\nI have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings. This analogy applies to the following line: I have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing with non-knowledge. Knowing without knowledge is great knowledge—yet I have never heard of such a person. These four lines speak of Yan Hui’s need to cast aside cunning intelligence.\n\nGaze upon that empty chamber: in an empty room, brightness is born, and auspiciousness comes to rest. This teaches Yan Hui the principle of an empty mind. Gazing upon the space within a gate and chamber is like the heart within a person. When an empty room is unobstructed, brightness naturally arises, and a hundred auspicious signs gather. When the mind is empty and unobstructed, it naturally becomes luminous, and ten thousand virtues congeal and rest. 'Comes to rest' means to rest and rest again. In the *Book of Changes*, yin and yang flow through the nine stars, and the central palace’s unobstructed brightness is considered auspicious—this also takes emptiness and lack of obstruction as its meaning. If one does not come to rest, this is called 'sitting in motion.' When the mind is unrestrained and knows no limit, the body may be still, but the mind is not—hence it is called 'sitting in motion.'\n\nIf you follow the ears and eyes, communicating inwardly but outwardly abandoning the mind’s knowledge, then ghosts and spirits will come to dwell—how much more so men! The ears and eyes are external, yet if you follow them inwardly, and the mind’s knowledge is internal, yet if you cast it outwardly—there is only emptiness. If this is so, then ghosts and spirits will come to dwell with you—how much more so men! The word 'dwell' responds to the earlier 'abode.'\n\nThis is the transformation of the ten thousand things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the lifelong practice of the ancient emperors Fu Xi and Qi. How much more so for one who is merely scattered and common! The principle of an empty mind is the means by which the ten thousand things are moved to transformation. It is the pivot by which Yu and Shun governed. It is what Fu Xi and Qi practiced throughout their lives. How much more so for the Lord of Wei, who is but a scattered and common man—how could he be difficult to transform?\"\n\nThe concluding passage about scattering horses is not part of the main text.\n\nWhen Gongzi Gao was about to be sent on a mission to Qi, he asked Confucius: \"The king has entrusted a weighty task to Zhuliang. Qi’s treatment of envoys is likely to be respectful but not urgent. Even a single state is not yet ready to be moved—how much less the feudal lords! I am deeply apprehensive.\"\n\nYou once told Zhuliang: \"In all matters, whether great or small, few are not brought to completion through joyful harmony. If a matter is not completed, there will surely be human calamities—punishment and blame. If it is completed, there will surely be the calamities of yin and yang—worry and illness from imbalance. Only one who possesses virtue can achieve success or failure without calamity.\"\n\n\"I eat coarse food and do not seek refinement. My kitchen stove is without desire for coolness. Now, upon receiving my mission in the morning, I drink ice in the evening—is this not internal heat? Coarse food is rough fare. 'Not seeking refinement' means not insisting on fine quality. 'Desire for coolness' refers to one who suffers from heat and seeks coolness. I eat only coarse, rough food and do not insist on refinement. My kitchen stove is simple, and the cook need not suffer from heat and long for coolness. Yet now, upon receiving my mission to Qi in the morning, I drink ice in the evening—this is the excess of worry and thought leading to internal heat, not the fault of food and drink.\"\n\n\"Before I have even reached the true nature of affairs—indeed, before I have grasped their essence—I have already incurred the harm of yin-yang imbalance. If the matter fails, there will inevitably be human-caused calamity; these are two dangers. As a minister, I am not equal to this task. Pray, tell me what to do.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"There are two great precepts in the world. The first is fate; the second is duty. Your love for your parents is fate—it cannot be untied from the heart. This is the principle of Heaven’s mandate, the natural arising of benevolence and love, which never parts from this heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is nowhere that is not the lord’s domain. 'Under heaven, none is not the king’s land; within the seas, none is not the king’s subject.' There is no escape within heaven and earth. These are called the great precepts.\n\nThus, in serving one’s parents, one finds contentment without choosing the place—this is the utmost of filial piety. In serving one’s lord, one finds contentment without choosing the task—this is the height of loyalty. In attending to one’s own heart, one remains unwavering in joy, unshaken by changing circumstances, accepting what cannot be helped as if it were fate—this is the perfection of virtue. As a minister and son, one must have something that cannot be obstructed. Focus on the true nature of affairs and forget the self—how then could one have leisure to delight in life and fear death? You may proceed in this way.\n\nLet me further share what I have heard: In close dealings, trust is naturally established without need for words. In distant dealings, loyalty must be expressed through words, and words must sometimes be conveyed by others. Conveying words that bring joy or anger to both parties is the most difficult task in the world. When both sides are pleased, their words will overflow with excessive praise; when both are angry, their words will overflow with excessive blame. If two states are both pleased, their words will inevitably contain exaggerated commendation; if both are angry, their words will inevitably contain exaggerated slander. This is why conveying such words is so difficult. All exaggeration is falsehood; falsehood cannot be trusted, and when trust is lacking, the messenger incurs misfortune.\n\nThus, the *Model Sayings* states: 'Transmit the constant truth of affairs; do not transmit exaggerated words, and you will be nearly blameless.' Moreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin with openness but often end in secrecy; when excess prevails, cunning abounds. Those who drink wine with propriety begin in order but often end in chaos; when excess prevails, strange amusements multiply. All things are like this. They begin with sincerity and trust but often end in vulgarity and coarseness. Their inception is simple, but their conclusion is inevitably grand.\n\nWords are like wind and waves; actions are like gain and loss. Wind and waves are easily stirred; gain and loss are easily endangered. Words, being insubstantial like waves following the wind, are easily set in motion. Actions, being real, constantly risk loss—hence, they are easily imperiled. Thus, anger arises without cause, and clever words become biased. When a beast is dying, it does not choose its sounds; its breath is ragged, and in this state, a vicious heart arises. If one encounters someone who vents their anger without regard for reason, one can only respond with clever, biased words—like a dying beast that cannot choose the quality of its sounds, only aware of its ragged breath. In this way, the harm of yin-yang imbalance arises, and a mental affliction takes root.\n\nWhen severity and exactitude reach their extreme, there will inevitably be an unworthy response, though one may not realize it. If one does not know how this comes to be, who can foresee the outcome? Thus, the *Model Sayings* states: 'Do not alter commands; do not urge completion—excess leads to harm.' Altering commands and urging completion endanger affairs. These two lines summarize the two *Model Sayings*: transmitting exaggerated words is excessive, and altering commands or urging completion is adding to or changing them, which leads to peril.\n\nWhat is beautifully accomplished takes time; what is badly accomplished cannot be undone. The perfection of beauty is difficult and requires long effort to achieve. The completion of evil is swift and leaves no time for correction. Can one not be cautious?\n\nMoreover, riding things to roam the mind and entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection. Why contrive a response? It is best to deliver the message—this is the difficult part. Why fabricate clever deceit to report to the Lord of Qi? Simply convey the Lord of Chu’s command. Yet I fear Lord Ye will deem this impractical, so I conclude by saying: this is the difficult part—referring to the earlier statement that this is the most difficult task in the world.\"\n\nYan He, a recluse of Lu, was about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei. He asked Qu Boyu: \"There is a man here whose nature is as if Heaven itself were destructive. If I deal with him without restraint, I endanger the state; if I deal with him with restraint, I endanger myself. His knowledge is just enough to recognize others’ faults but not to understand why they err. In such a case, what should I do?\"\n\nQu Boyu said: \"Excellent question! Be on guard, be careful, and rectify yourself! In form, do not be distant; in heart, do not be discordant. However, these two approaches have their pitfalls. In form, do not be too intimate; in heart, do not be too expressive. If your form is close but not intrusive, you will not be estranged, yet you must not indulge his preferences and follow him deceptively. If your heart is harmonious but not outwardly manifest, you will not be contrary, yet you must not display it externally and boast.\n\nIf your form is too intimate, you risk collapse, ruin, downfall, and stumbling. If your heart is too expressive, you risk becoming a reputation, a name, an omen, or a calamity. If he behaves like a child, then act like a child with him. If he is without boundaries, then be without boundaries with him. If he is without limits, then be without limits with him.\"\n\nTo attain this is to enter the realm of flawlessness. How could this be in vain? You must reach the state where flaws and errors do not arise.\n\nDo you not know the mantis? In its fury, it raises its arms to block the chariot’s wheel, unaware of its own incapacity—yet this is the very beauty of its ability. The mantis takes its power to obstruct as its finest trait.\n\nBeware, take heed: when one accumulates boasts of their own beauty and then provokes, they are on the brink. To boast is to vaunt. And you—you are nearly imperiled. If you amass praise for your own talents and beauty, then challenge with them, you court danger.\n\nDo you not know the keeper of tigers? He dares not feed it living prey, for fear of the rage that comes with killing; he dares not give it whole prey, for fear of the fury that comes with tearing it apart. Living prey must be slain, whole prey must be rent—thus stirring its wrath. He times its hunger and satiety, understanding the anger in its heart. Though tiger and man are of different kinds, the tiger flatters and submits to its keeper—this is compliance. Thus, what it kills is defiance. Such is the nature of compliance and defiance.\n\nThe lover of horses uses a basket to collect their dung and a conch-shell vessel to hold their urine. (The *shen* is a clam, used here to adorn the vessel.) Yet if a mosquito or horsefly alights upon the horse and the groom fails to brush it away at once, the horse will snap its bit, shatter its bridle, and trample its chest. Love may reach a point where it brings loss—can one not be cautious?\n\nThe tiger and horse are natures meant to illustrate the case of the Crown Prince Wei.\n\nCarpenter Shi traveled to Qi and, arriving at Quyuan, saw an oak that served as the village shrine. Its girth could shade an ox, its trunk measured a hundred spans around (a span here being the width of a hand), its height rivaled the mountains, and only after rising seventy feet did it put forth branches. A dozen or more of its side limbs could have been made into boats. Spectators thronged like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter did not so much as glance at it but walked on without pause. His disciple, having feasted his eyes, caught up with Carpenter Shi and said, “Since I first took up the axe to follow you, Master, I have never seen timber so magnificent. Why did you not even look at it but walk on without stopping?”\n\n“Enough,” said the carpenter. “Say no more. It is a useless tree. Make a boat from it, and it will sink; make a coffin, and it will rot at once; make a vessel, and it will break at once; make a door, and it will ooze sap like a *men* tree; make a pillar, and it will be eaten by worms. It is a tree of no use—hence its longevity.”\n\nWhen Carpenter Shi returned home, the shrine oak appeared to him in a dream and said, “With what would you compare me? Would you compare me to the so-called ‘fine timber’? Think of the hawthorn, pear, orange, and pomelo—all the fruit-bearing trees. When their fruit ripens, they are stripped; when it is plucked, they are abused. Their great branches are broken, their small branches are torn. This is how their abilities bring suffering to their lives. They do not live out their natural span but die halfway, struck down by the world’s blows. All things are like this. As for me, I have sought to be of no use for a long time. Nearly did I die—now at last I have found it: this is my great use. Had I been of use, would I have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—how can one thing judge another? And you, a nearly dead man of no consequence—what do you know of a useless tree?”\n\nCarpenter Shi awoke and interpreted his dream. His disciple said, “If it sought to be of no use, why does it serve as a shrine?”\n\n“Hush!” said the carpenter. “Say nothing. It merely lodges there, enduring the scorn of those who do not understand it. Were it not a shrine, would it not have been felled long ago? Moreover, what it preserves differs from what the common run preserves—how far removed is it to praise it with conventional standards!”\n\nMaster Nanbo Ziqi was wandering in Shangqiu when he saw a remarkable tree. A thousand four-horse chariots could shelter beneath it, its foliage shading all they relied upon. Ziqi said, “What tree is this?”\n\nThis must possess extraordinary timber, must it not? Yet gazing upward at its slender branches, they are gnarled and crooked—unfit for ridgepoles or beams. Looking down at its massive roots, they split like a broken axle, fissured and useless for coffins or outer caskets. Tasting its leaves, the mouth festers and is wounded; inhaling its scent, it drives one to raving madness for two days without cease.\n\nZiqi said, “This is indeed a useless tree—yet it has grown to such immense size! Alas!” Ziqi sighed to himself, “The spirit-like person employs this very uselessness.”\n\nIn the lands of Jing in Song, where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry thrive, those saplings of a hand’s span or two are felled to fashion perches for macaques; those of three or four arm-spans are hewn to craft the grand beams of renowned halls; those of seven or eight arm-spans are sawn for the flawless side-planks sought by noble households and wealthy merchants. Thus, before their natural span is complete, they meet an untimely end beneath the axe—such is the calamity of being useful. Here, then, is another instance of usefulness as peril, and thus the paradox is resolved.\n\nThe *Han \"Treatise on Suburban Sacrifices\"* records that the ancient Son of Heaven customarily performed the \"Spring Liberation Rites,\" speaking of absolving sins to seek blessings. They would offer a white-browed ox, a snub-nosed pig (for its nose was upturned and high, with a forehead crease), or a man afflicted with hemorrhoids—none of these could be used to ford the river, nor could they be sacrificed to the River God. The shamans and invocators knew this well, for such things, being of common use to men, were deemed inauspicious. Yet this is precisely what the spirit-like person regards as the greatest auspice.\n\nThere was one named Zhili Shu—\n*Zhili* describes his incomplete form; *Shu* was his name.\nHis chin was hidden in his navel,\n—*Qi* (navel) here is interchangeable with *ji* (to rise)—\nso that the hunchbacked could not see his chin, concealed as it was between his belly. His shoulders towered above his crown,\n—his head was lowered, his shoulders rising higher than his head—\nand his topknot pointed to the heavens.\n*—Cuo* (to gather) is read as *cu* (to bind); he gathered his hair into a topknot. In ancient times, the topknot was worn near the nape, so when the spine was bent and the head lowered, the topknot would point upward.*\nHis five *guan* were above,\n*—Guan* refers to the *shu* (transport points); the *shu* of the five viscera were all situated above.*\nhis two thighs formed his ribs,\n—his spine was within his thighs, so his two thighs served as his ribs—\nand he mended needles to sew clothes,\n—he could twist needles for sewing garments—\nenough to feed his mouth. He would shake the divining stalks and scatter the sacred grain,\n*—Gu* means to move the stalks for divination, as when people today draw lots. *Jing* refers to the refined rice used to offer to the spirits. The *Chu Ci* speaks of \"holding peppered grain to summon them,\" where the note explains *jing* as refined rice. *Bo* means to arrange it as an offering to the spirits.*\nthus performing divination and sacrificing to the spirits,\nenough to feed ten men.\n—His earnings were not merely enough to fill his own mouth.*\nWhen the authorities conscripted warriors, Zhili would stretch his arms among them,\n—relying on his uselessness, he did not hide himself—\nand when great labor was demanded, Zhili, citing his chronic illness, was exempted from service.\n—Being unfit for labor, when the authorities distributed grain to the sick, he received three *zhong*, six *hu*, and four *dou*, along with ten bundles of firewood.*\nThus, one whose form was as fragmented as Zhili’s could still nourish his body and live out his natural years—how much more, then, one whose virtue is fragmented!\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, Jie Yu, the Madman of Chu, wandered past his gate and called out:\n\"Phoenix! Phoenix!\nHow your virtue has declined!\nThe age to come cannot be awaited,\nthe age past cannot be pursued.\nWhen the world follows the Dao, the sage achieves his work;\nwhen the world loses the Dao, the sage preserves his life.\nIn this present time, one can but barely escape punishment.\nFortune is lighter than a feather, yet none know how to bear it;\ndisaster is heavier than the earth, yet none know how to avoid it.\nEnough! Enough!\nApproach others with virtue.\nPerilous! Perilous!\nMark the ground and hasten forth.\n—One should let their steps go where they may; if one marks the ground as their destination and rushes toward it, they will meet exhaustion and danger.*\n*Miyang! Miyang!*\nDo not harm my shoulders as I walk!\n*—Miyang* is the *mijue* (bracken fern). It grows thickly and can obscure the path of the sun, hence *miyang* (obscuring the yang). This is spoken metaphorically.*\nI walk in crooked paths,\n*—Que* is read as *xi* (a gap)—*\ndo not harm my feet!\"\n\nThe above is appended by way of commentary on the *Analects*; what follows are the words of *Zhuangzi*.\n\nMountain trees invite their own felling;\nfat and fire hasten their own burning.\nCinnamon is edible, so it is cut down;\nlacquer is useful, so it is slashed.\nAll men know the usefulness of the useful,\nyet none know the usefulness of the useless.\n\nThe foregoing concerns the oak of the sacred altar and the mulberry of Shangqiu—thus is this discourse tied to the theme of trees.\n\n*The True Classic of Southern Florescence, Following the Original Text, Scroll Five* (ends here)\n*The True Classic of Southern Florescence, Following the Original Text, Scroll Six*\nRecorded by Lu Lingzhufeng and Luo Miandao; collated by disciple Peng Xiang\n\n**Inner Chapters: \"Virtue’s Full Manifestation\"**\n*Fu* means \"verification.\"\nWhen virtue is full within, it is verified without.\nThough the form be incomplete, it is no hindrance—*Liezi* has a chapter titled \"Verification.\"\n\nIn Lu there was an amputee named Wang Tai. (Amputees are called *wu*; *tai* is his given name.) Those who followed him were as numerous as those who followed Confucius.\n\nZhou Changji asked Confucius, \"Wang Dai is an amputee, yet those who follow him divide Lu equally with you. When he stands, he does not teach; when he sits, he does not discourse. Yet they come to him empty and depart full. Is there truly a teaching without words, a shaping of the mind without form? What manner of man is he?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"This master is a sage. I have merely lagged behind and not yet gone to him. I too shall follow him, let alone those who are not my equal! Why should I rely on the multitudes of Lu? I shall lead all under Heaven to follow him.\"\n\nChangji said, \"Though he is an amputee, he surpasses you, Master—how much more so the common run of men! If this is so, how does he employ his mind?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Life and death are great matters, yet they do not alter him. Though heaven and earth collapse and fall, he would not be lost with them. He examines what is without reliance and does not shift with things; he commands the transformations of things while guarding their root.\"\n\nChangji said, \"What does this mean?\"\n\nConfucius said:\n\nSeeing from what sets them apart, the liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue; seeing from what unites them, the myriad things are all one. Such being the case, he wanders his mind in the harmony of virtue without knowing what the ears and eyes deem fitting. He regards what things share as one and does not see what they lose—seeing the loss of a foot as one would leave behind a clod of earth.\n\nChangji said, \"He cultivates himself. Through his knowledge, he attains his mind; through his mind, he attains the mind that is constant. Why then do people hold him in such esteem?\"\n\nChangji, though he had heard Confucius’ words, still did not grasp why Wang Tai was as he was. That man, in cultivating himself—judging by his knowledge—possessed no divine wisdom but merely the understanding his thoughts could reach; judging by his mind, he had no sagely heart but only the mind common to all. Why then should people revere him?\n\nConfucius said, \"People do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water. Only stillness can still the many. Water is one, yet it has places where it flows and places where it rests. People do not go to its flowing parts to see their reflections but to its still parts. This illustrates that Changji need not view Wang Tai as extraordinary but should simply see him as one who has attained the constant mind. His excellence lies precisely in stillness. The many come to rest where the still water is—all streams return to it and cease their flow. Wang Tai, with his constant mind, transforms others in the same way.\n\nEndowed by earth, only the pine and cypress remain verdant through winter and summer. Endowed by heaven, only Shun alone was upright. Fortunate indeed that he could rectify his own life and thereby rectify the lives of all. This further clarifies the principle that only stillness can still the many. All grasses and trees receive their mandate from earth, yet only the pine and cypress remain green through winter and summer. All people receive their mandate from heaven, yet only Shun attained uprightness. Amid the chaos of countless deviations, were it not for Shun’s uprightness, nearly the whole world would have fallen into depravity. Fortunate that Shun could rectify his own life and thereby rectify the lives of all under heaven—thus we see that only stillness can still the many.\n\nThe proof of preserving one’s beginning lies in the substance of fearlessness. A single brave warrior can charge into nine armies. Those who seek fame and bind themselves to their resolve are already like this—how much more so one who governs heaven and earth, stores the myriad things, merely lodges in the six limbs, mirrors the ears and eyes, unifies the knowledge of knowing, and whose mind has never died!\n\nThe proof of preserving one’s beginning is that it must yield verifiable signs, making it trustworthy. The substance of fearlessness is that true courage does not depend on others’ recognition. The nine armies refer to the ancient military formation based on the well-field system, where each army was divided into nine units that took turns in battle. Those who seek fame are those who preserve their beginning, while those who bind themselves to their resolve embody the substance of fearlessness. To govern heaven and earth means to take heaven and earth as one’s office and steward them. To store the myriad things means to treat all things as one’s treasury. *Zhi* means \"merely.\" *Yu* means to lodge without attachment. *Xiang* means to mirror without being real. \"Unifying the knowledge of knowing while the mind has never died\" means unifying the knowledge that is known without the mind ever being trapped by things and perishing. This responds to the earlier lines: \"Through his knowledge, he attains his mind; through his mind, he attains the mind that is constant.\"\n\nThe preceding two lines show that even those who seek fame and bind themselves to their resolve can become braver than ten thousand men—how much more so Wang Tai, who unifies his physical form and mind, and is not to be compared with those who seek fame and bind themselves to their resolve! Could he not move the multitudes of Lu?\n\nHe will choose a day to ascend to the heights. People will then follow him. How would he deign to concern himself with things?\n\n*Jia* means \"to reach.\" *Dengjia* means \"ascending to immortality,\" rising to heaven. In the *Great Master*, it is written: \"Ascending to the heights of the Dao.\" It is also pronounced *ge*. Cui’s version compares him to the stars below, saying that though he has life, he has no parents or death, and after ascending for three years, his form vanishes—also meaning he rises to heaven. This means that one day he will ascend to immortality and leave the human world behind. This is why people follow him. From this perspective, how would he deign to concern himself with things? The word \"things\" here responds to the earlier \"Why then do people hold him in such esteem?\"\n\nDaoist traditions often speak of choosing a day to ascend to immortality. Shentu Jia—of the Shentu clan—was an amputee who studied under Bohun Wuren (in the *Miscellaneous Chapters*, written as *Maoren*) alongside Zichan of Zheng. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I leave first, you stay behind; if you leave first, I will stay behind.\" He was ashamed to walk alongside an amputee. The next day, they again sat together in the same hall. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I leave first, you stay behind; if you leave first, I will stay behind. Now I am about to leave—can you stay behind? Or not?\" He asked this to ensure they would not leave together. \"Moreover, when you see the one in power, you do not avoid him—do you consider yourself equal to the one in power?\" (Here, Zichan refers to himself as the one in power.)\n\nShentu Jia replied, \"In Master Bohun Wuren’s school, is there really such a thing as one in power? Those who dwell in the Master’s school should forget distinctions of noble and base. Yet you delight in your position of power and place others behind you. I have heard that when a mirror is bright, dust does not settle on it; if it settles, the mirror is not bright. When one dwells long with the worthy, one commits no errors. Dwelling with the worthy to avoid errors is like using a mirror to grind away dust. Now, what you take as most important is the Master—you take from others to enlarge your virtue.\"\n\nAnd yet you still speak in such a way—is this not a fault? You have not yet ceased to err.\"\n\nZichan said, \"Since you are already as you are, do you still contend with Yao in goodness? Do you not reckon your virtue insufficient to turn back upon yourself? None who do good surpass Yao, yet you contend with Yao in goodness—this is to desire to surpass Yao and become the foremost man. You, having been careless and thus suffered amputation, still wish to contend with Yao in goodness. I fear your virtue is insufficient to turn back upon yourself and redress the fault of your amputation—how could you surpass Yao?\"\n\nShentu Jia replied, \"Those who explain their faults and yet are not deemed worthy of death are many; those who do not explain their faults and yet are not deemed worthy of life are few. *Self-explanation* means to state one’s own case. Following the previous mention of *fault*: if one states one’s faults, then one’s transgression is not great, and thus one suffers only amputation—those whose bodies are not deemed worthy of death are many. If one does not state one’s faults, others deem one’s crime extreme, deserving not merely amputation, and those whose bodies are not deemed worthy of life are few. To know there is no remedy and yet accept it as fate—only one of virtue can do this.\n\n\"Wandering within Yi’s drawn bow: the center is the very place where the arrow strikes. Yet to miss it is fate. Yi was skilled in shooting, and to wander within the range of his bow was to be in the place where the arrow must strike. Yet some escaped death by missing—this was fate. That I did not escape punishment was likewise fate.\n\n\"Many have mocked me for my incomplete foot, and I would flare up in anger. But when I came to the Master’s place, my anger would vanish and return to its source. Did the Master not wash me with goodness? I have wandered with you for nineteen years, yet you have never once taken me for a cripple. Now you wander with me within the bounds of form and yet seek me beyond form—is this not a fault? *Within the bounds of form*—virtue. *Beyond form*—amputation. To repeat: is this not a fault?\"\n\nZichan, startled, changed his expression and said, \"You need not speak thus.\"\n\nA cripple from Lu, Shushan Wuzhi, came to see Confucius. Confucius said, \"You were not careful, and already suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?\"\n\nWuzhi replied, \"I, not knowing my duty, failed to preserve my wholeness and treated my body lightly—thus I lost my foot. Now that I come, what remains of my honored foot still endures. *The right is honored*; though my left foot was amputated, my right foot remains. Thus I strive to preserve my wholeness. Heaven covers all without exception; Earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be like Heaven and Earth—how could I have known you would be thus, unable to bear my amputation?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"I am indeed coarse. Why not come in? Let me share with you what I have heard.\" Wuzhi departed.\n\nConfucius said, \"Disciples, take heed. Wuzhi, though a cripple, still strives to study and redress his past misdeeds—how much more should one of complete virtue do so!\"\n\nWuzhi said to Lao Dan, \"Is Confucius not yet a perfected person? Why does he show such deferential respect, treating his disciples as if they were his teachers? He seeks to make his name known through strange and marvelous deeds, unaware that the perfected person takes these as his own fetters.\"\n\nLao Dan said, \"Why not simply lead him to see death and life as a single thread, the permissible and the impermissible as a single strand, and thus free him from his fetters? Would this not suffice?\"\n\nWuzhi said, \"Heaven has punished him—how can it be undone?\"\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, \"In Wei there is an ugly man named Aitai Tuo. Men who dwell with him grow attached and cannot leave. Women who see him say to their parents, 'Rather than be another man’s wife, I would be this man’s concubine'—and there are more than ten such cases. He has never been heard to initiate speech; he merely harmonizes with others. He holds no position of rulership to save others from death, nor does he amass wealth to distribute it below...\"\n\nThe full moon’s fullness is likened to a man’s belly. Yet he startles the world with his ugliness, harmonizing without leading, his wisdom confined to no realm—yet male and female gather before him. These three phrases mark a turn in the preceding passage. \"Male and female\" refer to the men and women [mentioned earlier]. There must be something extraordinary about him.\n\nI summoned him to observe, and indeed, his ugliness startled the world. Yet when he dwelt with me, before a month had passed, I took note of his character; before a full year had elapsed, I trusted him. With no minister in the state, I offered him the governance. He responded with hesitation, as if declining. I felt shame—was I the shameful one?—and so turned inward. In the end, I entrusted him with the state. Soon after, he left me and departed. I grieved as if bereft, as though the kingdom held no joy for me. What manner of man is he?\n\nConfucius said, \"I once journeyed to Chu and chanced upon piglets nursing from their dead mother. After a moment, they shivered, glanced about, then abandoned her and fled. They did not see themselves in her, nor recognize her as their kind. What they loved in their mother was not her form, but that which animated her form. When they no longer saw themselves in her, the piglets knew only that their sustenance was gone; when they no longer recognized their kind, it was because the milk no longer resembled what they had known. That which animates form is spirit. The piglets, unaware of their mother’s death, fled when the spirit no longer connected.\n\nThis illustrates that in former days, your dealings with Aitai Tuo were not an exchange of forms but of spirits. To lose him is like the piglets losing their mother’s spirit.\n\nThose who die in battle are not buried with funeral fans; those who have lost their feet do not cherish their shoes. In both cases, the root is gone. Form is the root, while the fan and shoes are mere adornments. The consorts of the Son of Heaven do not cut their nails or pierce their ears, for one who draws near the ruler must not mar their form. A man who takes a wife remains apart from court for a time—*The Rites* prescribe that one in three years’ mourning or newly wed does not serve. If one whose form is whole may yet be thus, how much more one whose virtue is whole?\n\nNow Aitai Tuo wins trust without speaking, draws near without merit, and makes men offer him their states, fearing only that he will not accept. He must be one whose talents are whole and whose virtue does not manifest in form.\"\n\nDuke Ai said, \"What does it mean for talents to be whole?\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"Life and death, existence and annihilation, success and failure, wealth and poverty, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the workings of fate. They alternate day and night before us, yet knowledge cannot fathom their beginning. Thus they cannot disturb harmony or enter the mind’s sanctuary. To make one’s joy unbroken, to let day and night flow without gap, and to meet all things with the springtime of the heart—this is to bridge the intervals and bring forth the season within. The season does not arise from the qi of yin and yang, but from one’s own heart. This is what it means for talents to be whole.\n\nWhat does it mean for virtue not to manifest in form? Stillness is the fullness of water at rest. It may serve as a model, for it preserves its inner stillness without outward disturbance. Virtue is the cultivation of inner harmony. When virtue does not manifest in form, things cannot depart from it. Duke Ai’s attachment to Aitai Tuo is such a case.\"\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Confucius’ disciple Minzi, \"At first, I thought that by facing south as ruler of the world, upholding the people’s order, and grieving over their deaths, I had attained the utmost understanding. Now, hearing the words of a perfected person, I fear I lack substance, have treated my body lightly, and lost my state. I and Kong Qiu are not lord and subject, but friends in virtue.\"\n\nYin Qi, Zhi Li, Wu Shen—one guarded the city gate by standing on tiptoe, another was a man of broken form, and the last had no heels. Yet when they advised Duke Ling of Wei, he delighted in them, and when he looked upon whole men, their necks seemed too slender.\n\nThe neck is called *dou*. *Jianjian* describes its slender, elongated appearance. Delighting in the heel-less man while gazing upon whole men, the duke found their necks thin and long—ugly and unworthy of regard. The *Rites of Zhou*’s \"Artificer\" states: \"He counts the eyes and measures the neck.\" The commentary notes: \"A long neck,\" suggesting *jian* and *gu* share the same meaning.\n\nAnother man with a great goiter like a jar or urn advised Duke Huan of Qi. The duke delighted in him, yet when he looked upon whole men, their necks seemed *jianjian*. Thus, virtue may excel while form is forgotten. If one does not forget what ought to be forgotten but forgets what ought not to be forgotten, this is called true forgetting. What ought to be forgotten is form; what ought not to be forgotten is virtue. Yet the world forgets virtue while clinging to form—this is true forgetfulness.\n\nTherefore, the sage wanders freely, yet deems knowledge a blight, restraint glue, virtue a bond, and skill trade. The sage does not scheme—why employ knowledge? He does not carve—why employ glue? He suffers no loss—why employ virtue? He hoards no goods—why engage in trade? These four are the fasting of Heaven. The fasting of Heaven is the sustenance of Heaven. Having received sustenance from Heaven, why seek it from man?\n\n*Nie* means ominous blight; *yue*, strict restraint; *jiao*, fixation; *jie*, obligation; *gong*, craft; *shang*, merchant. The sage’s heart wanders in Heaven, yet he regards the wise as ominous, the restrained as rigid, the virtuous as bound to obligation, and the skilled as mere merchants. The sage does not plot—why use cunning? He does not carve—why use glue? Having nothing to lose, why practice the Way? Having no desire for gain, why engage in trade? Of these four lines, two are direct statements, two are metaphors. The term *shang* prompts the fourfold repetition.\n\nIt is the nurturance of Heaven—what Heaven bestows is constant. Receiving Heaven’s nurturance is to be fed by Heaven. Having received sustenance from Heaven, why seek it from man? This is like attaining Heaven’s nobility and not pursuing man’s rank.\n\nPossessing the form of man but not the passions of man: with the form of man, one mingles among men; without the passions of man, right and wrong do not adhere to one’s person. How tiny and insignificant—this is what binds one to humanity! How vast and grand—to stand alone in Heaven’s completion. *Ao* means release, the idea of attaining through letting go. This speaks of having no passions. Below, the text cites the debate with Huizi to expound the meaning of no passions.\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi: \"Do men truly have no passions?\"\nZhuangzi replied: \"Yes.\"\nHuizi said: \"If a man has no passions, how can he be called a man?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"The Dao gives him his appearance, Heaven gives him his form—how can he not be called a man?\"\nHuizi said: \"If he is called a man, how can he have no passions?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"This is not what I mean by passions. What I call having no passions is that a man does not inwardly harm his body with likes and dislikes, but constantly follows nature without embellishing life.\"\nHuizi said: \"Without embellishing life, how can one preserve one’s body?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"The Dao gives him his appearance, Heaven gives him his form—he does not inwardly harm his body with likes and dislikes. Now you strain your spirit externally, exhaust your essence, lean against a tree chanting, or rest on a withered paulownia in slumber. Heaven chose your form, yet you clamor about ‘hard and white.’\"\n\nThe Dao gives him his appearance, Heaven gives him his form—this is nature. \"Not embellishing life\" means that human life has the natural endowment of Heaven, to which not a hair’s breadth of human effort may be added. *Gaowu* refers to what is now called withered paulownia. *Wutong* and *gaotong* are synonymous, though the term may apply to various types of paulownia. Only the withered paulownia is used for lutes and zithers, hence the name. \"Resting on it in slumber\" means the instrument is always at hand, so even in weariness or drowsiness, one still clings to it. Standing, one leans against a tree chanting; sitting, one rests on a withered paulownia in slumber—these are the deeds of one who strains the spirit and exhausts the essence, who spurns Heaven’s gift to engage in debates over \"hard and white.\"\n\n*The True Classic of Southern Florescence, Following the Original Text, Scroll Six* ends.\n*The True Classic of Southern Florescence, Following the Original Text, Scroll Seven* begins.\n\n*The Record of Lu Lingzhu Peak by Luo Miandao, collated by his disciple Peng Xiang*\n\n**Inner Chapters: The Great Master Teacher**\nThis chapter expounds the esoteric essentials of the Dao, hence its title *The Great Master Teacher*.\n\nTo know what Heaven does and what man does—this is perfection.\nTo know what Heaven does is to be born of Heaven;\nTo know what man does is to nurture with what his knowledge knows what his knowledge does not know, so that he completes his Heaven-appointed years without dying prematurely—this is the fullness of knowledge.\n\nTo know what Heaven does is to embody the spontaneity of Heaven’s Dao.\nTo know what man does is to fulfill what human affairs ought to be.\nTo be born of Heaven is to follow Heaven in being born.\nWhat knowledge knows includes such things as cultivating goodness, shunning evil, pursuing fortune, and avoiding misfortune.\nWhat knowledge does not know is the utmost reality within oneself, which all possess yet do not recognize. If one can nurture it without harm, one may also complete one’s Heaven-appointed years without dying prematurely—this, too, is the fullness of knowledge.\n\nYet there is peril.\nFor knowledge must await something before it is *settled*, and what it awaits is precisely what is not settled.\nHow do we know that what I call Heaven is not man?\nOr that what I call man is not Heaven?\n\nEven so, in what is called knowing what man does, there remains cause for concern: though man may know it, he must still await Heaven before he attains certainty.\n*Settled* means *fixed*.\nYet what he awaits from Heaven is itself without fixity.\nAs with Yan and Robber Zhi, who lived long—goodness does not necessarily bring blessing, nor evil calamity—how then can we be sure that what I call Heaven does not belong to man, or what I call man does not belong to Heaven?\n\nOnly with the true person does true knowledge arise.\nThe true person alone truly knows the distinction between Heaven and man.\n\nWhat is the true person?\nThe true persons of old did not resist the few—though they gained little, they did not resent it.\nThey did not vaunt their achievements—though they succeeded, they did not inflate their qi.\nThey did not scheme for affairs—*affairs* encompasses all undertakings. They entrusted everything to spontaneity and did not plan ahead.\n\nSuch were they: when they erred, they did not regret; when they acted rightly, they did not congratulate themselves.\nSuch were they: they ascended heights without trembling, entered water without getting wet, entered fire without feeling heat—this is knowledge that has ascended to the utmost in the Dao.\n\nThus the true persons of old:\nIn sleep, they did not dream; in waking, they had no cares.\nTheir food was not savored; their breath was deep.\nThe true person’s breath reaches the heels; the common person’s breath reaches only the throat.\nDeep breath is as if stored in the feet; shallow breath emerges from the throat—though in truth, the *qi*-sea is the root of breath.\nThose who *qufu* (flatter and fawn) have constricted throats, their speech like lewd music.\n*Qufu* refers to those who ingratiate themselves with others. Their words, uttered between the throat, resemble wanton melodies.\nThe deeper one’s desires, the shallower one’s heavenly mechanism.\nThe *heavenly mechanism* is the natural movement of qi, that is, breath. Deep desires make breath shallow.\nThus those who *qufu* have deep desires, and their speech, like croaking, reveals a shallow heavenly mechanism.\n\nThe true persons of old did not delight in life, nor did they abhor death.\nThey did not rejoice in going forth, nor did they resist returning.\nThey came and went with effortless ease, nothing more.\nThey did not forget their beginning, nor did they seek their end.\nThey received and rejoiced in it; they forgot and returned to it.\nThis is called not using the mind to cast aside the Dao, not using man to assist Heaven—this is the true person.\n\nSuch were they:\nTheir minds were steadfast—*mind* here means *intent*, which did not wander.\nTheir demeanor was tranquil; their foreheads broad and smooth.\nTheir bearing was chill as autumn, warm as spring.\nTheir joy and anger passed through the four seasons, harmonizing with things without anyone knowing their limit.\n\nThus when the sage employs troops, he may destroy a state yet not lose the people’s hearts.\nHis beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet he does not act out of love for others.\nTherefore, one who delights in connecting with things is no sage;\nOne who has partiality is not humane;\nOne who relies on the seasons is not worthy—when primordial qi is undifferentiated, how can the four seasons be distinguished?\nOne who does not connect benefit and harm is no gentleman—when they are connected and made one, how can benefit and harm be distinguished?\nOne who pursues fame at the cost of self is no scholar;\nOne who loses self is not true—such cannot employ others, nor be employed by others.\n\nLike the ancient worthies—*Hujie*, *Wuguang* (a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time, whose ears were seven inches long), *Boyi*, *Shuqi*, *Jizi* (also called *Xuyu*; *Shizi* says Jizi’s name was *Xuyu*, though some say it was *Bigan*), *Jita*, *Shentu Di* (men of the Yin dynasty; *Xunzi* records that the latter carried a stone and drowned himself in the river)—they allowed themselves to be employed by others, followed others’ paths, yet did not follow their own.\n\nThe true persons of old:\nTheir appearance was fitting yet not cliquish—they harmonized with things without forming factions.\nThey seemed insufficient yet did not defer—humble and retiring, they did not lightly submit.\nThey were companionable yet not rigid—their bearing was relaxed and self-possessed, like a vessel with edges yet not hard or stubborn.\nThey were expansive yet not florid—their qi was vast and open, though empty, it was not merely ornamental.\nThey were buoyant, as if pleased!\nYet restrained, as if compelled!\n*Buoyant* means exuberant; *restrained* implies self-suppression. Though they seemed pleased, there was something they could not help.\nThey were full in their expression toward me, yet steadfast in their virtue toward me—though their appearance was full, their virtue was steadfast.\nThey were coarse, as if worldly—*coarse* means unrefined. Though they did not cultivate refinement, blending with the vulgar, they were vigilant in their loftiness and unruliness, beyond control.\n\nTheir affinity was boundless in their love of leisure, their oblivion so profound they forgot their own words. *Boundless* means continuous and unbroken; *oblivion* means abandonment and forgetting. Though their manner was sealed and impenetrable, with nothing to glimpse or trace, they remained forgetful, never boasting of themselves.\n\nThey took punishment as their foundation, ritual as their wings, wisdom as their timing, and virtue as their path. Taking punishment as their foundation meant they were lenient in their severity; taking ritual as their wings meant they could move through the world; taking wisdom as their timing meant they acted only when compelled by circumstance; taking virtue as their path meant that, like one who walks to the hills, they were seen as diligent in practice—yet their progress was natural.\n\nRitual is the root of personal conduct. The root serves as the foundation, while punishment aids governance. The law serves as wings; yet though punishment is established, it is tempered by leniency and does not kill, thus it can be the foundation. Though ritual is strict, it can be practiced throughout the world, thus it can be the wings. Virtue governs the natural—like the movement of the four seasons, it operates without deliberate intent to encompass all things. Like a traveler following a path, one responds to affairs not by force but by necessity, acting naturally. Thus, virtue’s cultivation is not forced, like accidental footprints on a mountain—those who do not understand may truly believe it is diligent effort. Therefore, their love of it was singular, and their lack of love was also singular.\n\nTheir singularity was singular, and their lack of singularity was also singular. The singular joined with Heaven as its companion; the non-singular joined with man as its companion. Heaven and man do not overcome one another—this is called the *True Person*. Those who loved it were fundamentally one with me; those who did not love it also regarded it as one. Thus, their oneness with me was singular, and their lack of oneness was also singular. The singular naturally joined with Heaven as its companion; the non-singular naturally joined with man as its companion. Heaven and man do not overcome one another—why then introduce likes and dislikes between them?\n\nLife and death are a matter of fate, as constant as night and day—this is Heaven. What man cannot interfere with is the nature of things. They took Heaven as their father and cherished it, yet how much more should they cherish what transcends it! Men take having a lord as better than themselves and die for it, yet how much more should they value what is true!\n\nWhen a spring dries up, fish find themselves stranded on land, breathing moisture onto one another, wetting each other with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it is better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao.\n\nThe nature of things is their true principle. Taking Heaven as one’s father means the father is the Heaven of the child. What transcends this is the Dao, loftier than the father. What is true in this Dao is the true lord. To be transformed by the Dao is to be dissolved in it, so that praise and blame vanish.\n\nLife and death are fate, like Heaven’s constancy of night and day—beyond human power to alter, an unchanging principle of things. One should return to this Dao alone. This Dao is more revered in man than lord or father, yet man does not realize it. Rather than entangling oneself in the fray of praise and blame, how much better to rise above it in this Dao.\n\nThe Great Clod burdens me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death—thus, to treat life well is to treat death well. Hiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh seems secure, yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry them away, and the unwitting will not know. Even when small and large are hidden appropriately, there is still escape. But to hide the world within the world is to leave no room for escape—this is the great truth of things.\n\nMen delight in possessing human form, yet if this form undergoes ten thousand transformations without end, how can its joy be measured! Thus, the sage wanders where things cannot escape and all are preserved. Embracing early death and old age, beginning and end—people emulate this, let alone the myriad things bound to it and awaiting the one transformation!\n\nTo treat life well and death well—this \"well\" belongs to the Creator. To embrace early death and old age, beginning and end—this \"well\" belongs to man. Embracing early death means that though one dies young, it is not a bad death. The one transformation differs from the ten thousand transformations: the ten thousand transformations are the myriad changes wrought by man, while the one transformation is the great leap, unbound by the Dao.\n\nReturning to life and death: life inevitably leads to death, yet those who cling to life and shun death still cannot escape. It is like hiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh, believing it secure—unaware that in the dead of night, the boat may be moved by a strong man, the mountain felled by force, all beyond expectation and unnoticed. Though the ravine is vast and the boat small, the marsh vast and the mountain small, each hidden appropriately, there is still escape. But to hide the world within the world is to leave no room for concealment—no place to flee. Thus, rather than hiding with intent, it is better to hide without intent.\n\nWhat is meant by \"hiding the world within the world\" is like tilling fields and digging wells, unaware of the Emperor’s power. The world, too, is a thing—thus, this is the great and constant truth of things. Earlier, only the nature of things was mentioned; here, \"constant\" and \"great\" are added, extending the analogy of hiding boats, mountains, and the world. It seems strange, so the word \"constant\" broadens it to the world, while \"great\" returns to the human body. Thus, it is said that even briefly possessing human form is cause for joy. What is precious about human form is that it contains ten thousand transformations—how can its joy be measured?\n\nThus, the sage wanders where things cannot escape and all abide—this is what is meant by \"hiding the world within the world.\" The sage grasps the essence of hiding the world, enabling the people to nurture life, bury the dead, and suffer no plague of epidemics or calamities. Yet people still admire and emulate such governance—how much more so when the Dao is hidden within the body, for it is the root of the ten thousand things and the source of all transformation, nearer and more intimate than hiding the world. Is there anything easier?\n\nThe Dao has sentiment and sincerity, is without action and without form; it may be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen. It is self-originating, self-rooted, existing before heaven and earth, enduring since ancient times. It spiritually animates ghosts and gods, gives birth to heaven and earth. Before the Supreme Ultimate, it is not lofty; below the six directions, it is not profound. Born before heaven and earth, it is not ancient; older than antiquity, it is not aged.\n\nThe term \"Dao\" reveals the Great Ancestral Master as possessing sentiment and sincerity, being without action and without form—just as the *Qiwu* chapter states: it may be practiced, is trustworthy yet without visible form, has sentiment yet no shape. It has the sentiment of union, the sincerity of verification, yet no deliberate action and no tangible image. It may be transmitted orally but not handed over, attained in the heart but not seen with the eyes. For it is formless, the root of yin-yang and the five phases, existing before heaven and earth. Ghosts and gods rely on it for their numinosity, heaven and earth rely on it for their generation—this is what Laozi calls the \"root of heaven and earth.\" Humans share the same pivot with creation, so within the body there is also a Supreme Ultimate. Laozi and Zhuangzi’s discourse on the Dao extends only this far. Later generations borrowed metaphors like lead, mercury, dragon, and tiger to make it clearer and more accessible.\n\nIt is not lofty, not profound, not ancient, not aged—all are words of praise. Fu Xi grasped it to harness heaven and earth; Fuxi attained it to inherit the mother of qi. The Northern Dipper holds it, remaining unconfused through the ages; the sun and moon hold it, ceaselessly revolving. Kanpi grasped it to inherit Kunlun, seizing the mother of primordial qi—the Northern Dipper is the celestial axis. Sima Biao says: Kanpi is a spirit with a human face and beast’s body. Feng Yi attained it to roam the great rivers. Sima Biao says: According to the *Qingling Zhuan*, Feng Yi was a man from Dishou in Tongxiang, Huayin, who ingested eight minerals, became a water immortal, and is known as the River Earl. Another account says he drowned in the river on the gengzi day of the eighth month. Jianwu grasped it to dwell on Mount Tai. Sima Biao says: A mountain spirit who did not die until the time of Confucius. The Yellow Emperor attained it to ascend to the cloudy heavens; Zhuanxu grasped it to reside in the Dark Palace. The Yellow Emperor ascended to heaven through the Dao. The Dark Palace is the palace of the north. The *Monthly Ordinances* says: Its emperor is Zhuanxu, its spirit is Xuanming. Yuqiang holds it, standing at the North Pole. Sima Biao says: The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: On an islet in the Northern Sea there is a spirit with a human face and bird’s body, wearing two blue snakes as earrings and treading two red snakes, named Yuqiang. The Queen Mother of the West attained it, seated in Shaoguang. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says: The Queen Mother of the West resembles a human, with a dog’s tail and disheveled hair, wearing a sheng-ornament and skilled in whistling, dwelling by the banks of the Xun River. The *Inner Biography of Emperor Wu of Han* says: The Queen Mother of the West and the Lady of the Upper Prime descended to the emperor, beautiful in appearance, divine immortals. Shaoguang, according to Sima Biao, is a cave name. Cui says: a mountain name. Another says: the name of the empty realm in the west. None know her beginning, none know her end. These two lines refer to the Queen Mother of the West. Peng Zu attained it, living from the time of Youyu through the Five Lords; Li says: The Five Lords are Kunwu of Xia, Da Peng and Shiwei of Yin, and Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin in Zhou. Fu Yue grasped it to assist Wu Ding, ruling the world, riding the eastern cord and the tail of the Winnowing Basket to join the ranks of the stars. Sima Biao says: Fu Yue is a star above the tail, meaning he rode between the eastern cord and the tail of the Winnowing Basket. The Winnowing Basket and Dipper are the eastern cord of the Milky Way’s ford. Cui’s version adds twenty-two more characters here, but they are inappropriate to the meaning. From the beginning of this chapter to this point, the essentials of the Great Dao are fully expounded. Yet fearing people might cling rigidly, the following text further elaborates that life and death are both void, broadening their vision—akin to the teachings of the School of Principle and the School of Nature.\n\nNanbo Zi Kui asked Nü Ou: \"You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like that of a child. How is this?\" He replied: \"I have heard the Dao.\" Nanbo Zi Kui said: \"May I learn it?\" He said: \"Alas! How could you?\"\n\nYou are not the right person for this.\n\nNow, there was one named Bu Liangyi who possessed the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might indeed become a sage. If not, to impart the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy indeed. Yet I still persisted in teaching him: after three days, he was able to put the world outside himself. Once he had put the world outside himself, I persisted further, and after seven days, he was able to put things outside himself. Once he had put things outside himself, I persisted further, and after nine days, he was able to put life outside himself. Only after putting life outside himself could he attain clarity at dawn. With a single dawn, he penetrated all—no need to wait for seven or nine days. After attaining clarity at dawn, he could perceive the solitary. After perceiving the solitary, he could transcend past and present. After transcending past and present, he could enter the realm of neither death nor life. That which kills life does not die; that which gives life to life does not live. Withering the form and deadening the heart is how one kills life yet does not die; indulging the passions and following desires is how one gives life to life yet does not live.\n\nAs a thing, it sends off all without exception, welcomes all without exception, destroys all without exception, and completes all without exception. Its name is *yingning*—tranquility through disturbance. *Jiang* means to send off. Though things may strike against it, they naturally settle into tranquility. *Yingning* is that which is completed only after disturbance.\n\nNanbo Zikui said: \"From whom did you hear this?\"\nHe replied: \"I heard it from the son of *Fumo*. The son of *Fumo* heard it from the grandson of *Luosong*. *Cheng* means to complete and settle. *Fumo* and *Luosong* are borrowed names for writing and recitation. The grandson of *Luosong* heard it from *Zhanming*; *Zhanming* heard it from *Niexu*. *Zhanming* and *Niexu* are borrowed names for seeing and hearing. *Niexu* heard it from *Xuyi*; *Xuyi* heard it from *Yuming* and *Yu’ou*. *Xuyi* and *Yushu* are borrowed names for laborers’ songs and chants. *Yu’ou* heard it from *Xuanming*; *Xuanming* heard it from *Canliao*; *Canliao* heard it from *Yishi*. *Canliao* refers to the vast and boundless beginning, the profound beyond profundity.\n\nZisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai said to one another: \"Who can take non-being as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tailbone? Who knows that death and life, existence and nonexistence, are one body? That one shall be my friend.\" The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord, and so they became friends.\n\nSoon after, Ziyu fell ill, and Zisi went to visit him.\nZiyu said of himself: \"How magnificent! The Creator is making me like this—so contorted!\" *Juju* means extreme curvature. *Jiang* suggests it may grow even worse. His back was hunched, his spine exposed.\n\nThe five orifices rise above, his chin sinks to his navel, his shoulders tower above his crown—these three phrases are explained in *\"Among the People.\"* His neck vertebrae jut toward heaven. *Juzhui* refers to the cervical vertebrae. *Ju* means \"joint.\" The twenty-four spinal joints protrude like tumors. These five lines all describe Ziyu’s form. The qi of yin and yang has fallen into disorder. This single line speaks of his illness. Yet his heart remains untroubled, and leaning on his staff, he gazes into the well, saying: \"Alas! The Creator is once more making me like this—so contorted!\"\n\nHe does not suffer from his affliction. Leaning on his staff and dragging himself forward, he naturally gazes into the well, his form already bent. Now, stricken again, his contortion will only grow worse. Zisi said: \"Do you resent it?\" Zisi spoke in jest: \"Do you resent this?\"\n\nZiyu replied: \"Why would I resent it? If gradually I were transformed, and my left arm became a rooster, I would use it to crow at dawn. If gradually my right arm became a crossbow, I would use it to hunt owls for roasting. If gradually my corpse became a wheel, and my spirit a horse, I would ride it—why would I need another chariot? Moreover, what comes is timing; what goes is compliance. Abiding in timing and complying with change, sorrow and joy cannot enter. This is what the ancients called *xuanjie*.\"\n\n*Jin* means \"gradual.\" *Jia* means \"suppose.\" *Shi* means \"to serve.\" *Xuan* is written as *xuan* (suspended), meaning *jie* (release). Like the release of something suspended, it is akin to the untying of an inverted hanging. Those who cannot free themselves are bound by things. When something is suspended above, if it suddenly unbinds itself, it is called *xuanjie*. Those who cannot free themselves have been forcibly tied by others, leaving no way to untangle themselves. This speaks of how deeply the heart is entangled by worldly concerns. Moreover, things have long been unable to overcome Heaven. Why should I resent it?\"\n\nSoon after, Zilai fell ill, gasping as if near death. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Li went to visit him and shouted: \"Away! Begone! Do not disturb his transformation!\"\n\nThe Daoists regard death as transformation, so Li shouted at them to leave and not disturb this transformation. Leaning against the doorway, he spoke to Zilai: \"How wondrous is the work of creation! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it turn you into a mouse’s liver? Or an insect’s limb?\"—for none can know into what form one might transform, or whether it may become something exceedingly small.\n\nZilai said: \"To parents, a child must obey their commands, no matter if they send them east, west, south, or north. The forces of yin and yang govern man no less than parents do. If they now draw near to my death and I refuse to heed them, I would be obstinate—what fault would lie with them? The great earth bears me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me in death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well.\n\n\"Now, when a great smith casts metal, if the metal leaps up and cries, *'I must become a* *Mo Ye* *sword!'* the smith would surely deem it ill-omened. Likewise, if one who has taken human form were to say, *'I am human! I am human!'* the Creator would surely deem them an ill-omened person. It is not necessary to insist on transforming into a human—what harm is there in becoming another thing? Now, if we take heaven and earth as a great furnace and creation as a great smith, where could one go and not be acceptable?\"\n\nThen Zilai fell into a peaceful slumber and awoke with a start—*peaceful* as in tranquil, and *awoke* as in the suddenness of waking. For life is but a dreamlike death, and death but an awakening.\n\nZisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Ziqin Zhang became friends and said to one another: \"Who among us can join together in non-joining, act for one another in non-acting? Who can ascend to heaven, roam the mists, soar boundlessly into the infinite, and forget life without end or limit?\" The three looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord—*soar* as in playful ascent. Since all three could do as they described, they no longer needed to respond, but simply exchanged smiles, their hearts free of discord. Thus they became friends, harmonious and without gap.\n\nWhen Zisang Hu died, his body had yet to be buried. Upon hearing this, Confucius sent Zigong to attend to the funeral rites. Zigong went to wait upon the proceedings—his task being to prepare the mourning rituals. As all three were men of Lu, Zigong was dispatched.\n\nThere, one wove reed mats, another plucked the zither, and together they sang in harmony:\n*\"Ah, come, Zisang Hu!*\n*Ah, come, Zisang Hu!*\n*You have returned to your true nature,*\n*While we still remain as men—oh!\"*\n\nZigong hastened forward and said, \"May I ask: is it proper to sing before the corpse?\"\nThe two looked at each other and smiled, saying, \"What does he know of the meaning of ritual?\"\n\"The essence of ritual arises from human feeling—if feeling does not stir, what use is ritual?\"\n\nZigong returned and reported to Confucius: \"What manner of men are they? They have cultivated their conduct to the point of disregarding their own forms, singing before the corpse without change of countenance. I have no words to describe them. What manner of men are they?\"\nConfucius said, \"They wander beyond the bounds, while I wander within them. Outer and inner do not reach one another—had I sent you to offer condolences, I would have been crude indeed. They are now companions of the Creator, roaming in the single qi of Heaven and Earth. *Bounds* here means the established norms. *Companions of the Creator* means they follow what gives them life and become one with it. Heaven and Earth generate all things through nothing more than a single qi; human life in the world is but a roaming within this single qi of Heaven and Earth. To them, life is an excrescent growth, death the bursting of a boil. If this is so, how could they know where life and death, before and after, truly lie? Borrowing from strange things, entrusting themselves to shared form; forgetting liver and gall, neglecting ears and eyes; circling through beginning and end, unaware of origin or end—vagrant beyond the dust, carefree in the work of non-action. How could they be muddled by worldly ritual, seeking to impress the eyes and ears of the crowd?\"\n\nZigong said, \"Then upon what bounds does the Master rely?\"\n*\"Muddled\"* means confused. *\"The eyes and ears of the crowd\"* refers back to the earlier question about ritual. Earlier, you spoke of wandering within bounds—now, seeing this, I wonder upon what bounds you rely.\nConfucius said, \"I am one of Heaven’s punished people. Yet even so, I share this with you.\"\nConfucius referred to himself: \"I cannot be like them—I am one of those punished by Heaven. Though this is so, I will share this Way with you.\"\nZigong said, \"May I ask what this bound is?\"\nConfucius said, \"Fish are made for water, men are made for the Dao. Those made for water dig ponds to be nourished; those made for the Dao find stillness without effort. *Bound* here means the method by which one attains mastery. Fish made for water dig ponds and are thus nourished; men made for the Dao find stillness without effort. Thus it is said: Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes, men forget one another in the arts of the Dao. Forgetting in rivers and lakes means no longer needing to dig ponds; forgetting in the arts of the Dao means no longer needing effortless stillness—being made for something is not as good as forgetting it.\"\n\nZigong said, \"May I ask about the *unconventional person*?\"\nConfucius was often out of step with the world, so Zigong asked about the *unconventional person*.\nConfucius said, \"The *unconventional person* is unconventional among men but equal to Heaven. Thus it is said: Heaven’s petty man is man’s noble man; man’s noble man is Heaven’s petty man.\"\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius, \"Mengsun Cai—when his mother died, he wept without tears, his heart felt no grief, and in his mourning station he showed no sorrow. Lacking these three, he yet overshadowed Lu with his mastery of mourning. Is it truly possible to gain a reputation without substance?\"\nYan Hui found this particularly strange.\nConfucius said, \"Mengsun Cai has exhausted it—he has advanced beyond knowledge. He surpasses those who know mourning rites. He sought simplicity but could not attain it—yet he has already simplified. Those who study the Dao desire to diminish their emotions but cannot; Mengsun Cai has already diminished his. Mengsun Cai does not know why he lives, nor why he dies. He does not know what to pursue first, nor what to follow after—whether death comes first or later. If he has transformed into a thing, does he wait for the transformations he does not know to reach him? And if he is about to transform, how could he know that he will not? If he is about not to transform, how could he know that he already has? *Transformed into a thing* refers to those already transformed; *transformations reaching him* refers to those not yet transformed. *Transformations he does not know* means those he does not realize have reached him. It is as if those who died earlier transformed into things, waiting for the transformations they do not know to reach them—yet those who are about to die, how could they know they will not transform? And those about not to transform, how could they know they already have? I and you are but dreamers who have not yet awakened—how could we know? Moreover, he has a startling form but an undamaged heart. *He* refers to those who study the Dao: though their physical changes may seem alarming, they do not harm the heart. He has a temporary dwelling but no emotional death. Human life in the world is fleeting as a single morning, yet this does not kill his emotions. Mengsun Cai alone awakens—when others weep, he weeps too, following their *so-ness*. *So* is a familiar term, like *you* or *thou*, the opposite of *I*. Parents are one’s close kin, while others may be called *you* or *thou*. Now Mengsun Cai merely awakens to others weeping and weeps with them—his weeping does not come from the heart but from their *so-ness*, treating his kin as if they were others’ kin. And yet, we call this *our* ears—how could we know what we truly mean by *our*?\"\n\nThe base text originally had only the single character *qie* (且), but adding *ye* (也) softens the phrasing for readability. *Qiefu* (且夫) and *qie* (且) share the same meaning. Following the earlier *nai* (乃), the *wu* (吾) below naturally arises. Suppose Confucius were to say: \"Yet *we*—I and Yan Hui—dare not view our kin as Mengsun Cai does, treating them as if they were others’ kin, calling them *our* own. But how can we truly know what we mean by *our*?\"\n\nThe text below elaborates this meaning:\nYet have you ever dreamed of being a bird soaring to the heavens, or a fish diving deep into the abyss? Do you know whether the speaker now is awake—or dreaming? Ordinary dreams of fish or birds are not so strange, but to dream of being a crow flying straight to the sky, or a fish plunging directly into the depths—clearly, in that moment, one’s self *is* the bird or fish. Yet here we are, speaking now—how can we be sure this is waking? Might it not be the dream instead? Seen thus, what we call *our* own remains unknowable. Earlier, it was said, \"We are merely dreaming and have not yet awakened\"; now it is said, \"Even waking may be a dream\"—this goes a step deeper.\n\nOne arrives at joy before laughter, offers laughter before arranging it.\n*Zao* (造) means \"to reach\"; *shi* (适) means \"contentment.\" Joy naturally gives rise to laughter, but when one suddenly attains a state of perfect contentment, true delight arises before laughter can follow. Then, when laughter is spontaneously offered, it comes without preparation. *Pai* (排) means \"to arrange.\" Spontaneous laughter arises unconsciously, without need for deliberate arrangement—this illustrates the natural, uncontrived truth that does not depend on rigid adherence to ritual and propriety.\n\nTo submit to fate and embrace transformation is to enter the vast and solitary One.\nExpanding on *pai* (排): human life’s wealth or poverty, high or low status, are all predetermined, like the arrangements of creation—one should simply accept them. Death dissolves all, returning to nothingness, which carries the sense of vast emptiness. *Yi* (一) refers to the primordial state before the Great Ultimate divided. To \"enter the vast and solitary One\" is to return to that origin.\n\nYierzi visited Xu You and asked: \"How did Yao assist you?\"\nYierzi replied: \"Yao told me: 'You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness, and clearly distinguish right from wrong.'\"\nXu You said: \"Then why have you come to me now? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness, and mutilated you with right and wrong. How will you wander the boundless, carefree, and ever-shifting paths?\"\n*Zisui* (恣睢) describes unbridled freedom; *zhuanxi* (转徙) means unrestrained movement.\nYierzi said: \"Even so, I wish to wander within their bounds.\"\nXu You said: \"You cannot. The blind have no part in the beauty of brows and eyes, nor the color of faces; the sightless have no share in the splendor of blue and yellow, embroidered patterns and brocade.\"\n*Wutongzi* (无瞳子) refers to the blind; *gu* (瞽) refers to those with pupils but no sight.\nYierzi said: \"Yet Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang lost his strength—\"\nBoth are hypothetical names: *Wu Zhuang* (无庄) means \"without adornment,\" *Ju Liang* (据梁) means \"relying on brute force.\"\n\"—and the Yellow Emperor lost his wisdom, all through the refining fires of the forge.\"\n*Chui* (锤) is interchangeable with *zhui* (锤).\n\"How can we know that the Creator will not heal my branding and mend my mutilation, allowing me to ride the perfected Way and follow you?\"\nXu You said: \"Alas!\"\n\nUnknowable it remains. Let me speak to you of its great outline!\n\nO my master! O my master—this is what is meant by the Great Ancestral Master! One who nurtures the ten thousand things yet claims no righteousness, whose blessings span ten thousand generations yet claims no benevolence, who is older than high antiquity yet claims no eld, who encompasses heaven and earth, carves and shapes all forms yet claims no craft—this is the realm in which one roams.\n\nYan Hui said: \"I have advanced.\"\nZhongni said: \"What do you mean?\"\nHe replied: \"I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness.\"\nZhongni said: \"Good, yet still not enough.\"\n\nAnother day, he appeared again and said: \"I have advanced.\"\nZhongni said: \"What do you mean?\"\nHe replied: \"I have forgotten ritual and music.\"\nZhongni said: \"Good, yet still not enough.\"\n*(For Laozi and Zhuangzi, benevolence and righteousness arise from human artifice, thus inferior to ritual and music.)*\n\nYet another day, he appeared again and said: \"I have advanced.\"\nZhongni asked: \"What do you mean?\"\nHe replied: \"I have attained *zuowang* (sitting-forgetting).\"\nZhongni started and said: \"What is *zuowang*?\"\nYan Hui replied: \"I have cast off my limbs and body, dimmed my hearing and sight, severed myself from form and abandoned knowledge, merging with the Great Thoroughfare—this is *zuowang*.\"\n\nZhongni said: \"To merge is to have no preferences; when nothing is not merged with, there are no private attachments. To transform is to have no constancy; only by following transformation can there be no fixed abode. And you have indeed proven yourself worthy! I, Qiu, would follow after you.\"\n\nZiyu and Zisang were friends, and for ten days it rained without cease. Ziyu said: \"Zisang must be in dire straits.\" He wrapped up rice and went to feed him.\n\nArriving at Zisang’s gate, he heard sounds like singing, like weeping—plucking his zither, Zisang cried: \"Father! Mother! Heaven! Man!\" His voice could no longer bear the strain, yet he hastened to recite his verse. (The word *qu* means \"to hasten,\" for his voice was spent with exhaustion; *quju* means to recite without melody or tune.)\n\nZiyu entered and asked: \"Why do you sing your verse in this way?\"\n\nZisang replied: \"I pondered who brought me to this extremity, but found no answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers all without partiality; Earth bears all without favor. Would Heaven and Earth single me out for poverty? I sought the cause, yet could not find it. And so I have come to this extremity—it is fate, nothing more!\"\n\n*The Seventh Scroll of the Nan Hua Zhen Jing, Following the Original Text, Concludes Here*\n*The Eighth Scroll of the Nan Hua Zhen Jing, Following the Original Text*\n*Recorded by Lu Lingzhufeng’s Luo Miandao, Collated by His Disciple Peng Xiang*\n*Inner Chapters: \"The Adjustment of Controversies\"*\n\nThis chapter serves to guide emperors and kings in their governance; should they comprehend its meaning, they would return to the era of High Antiquity. Thus concludes the Inner Chapters.\n\nNie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times received no answer. Thereupon Nie Que leapt with great joy and went to inform Master Pu Yi. Cui Yun notes: *He threw on his robe.* Master Pu Yi said: \"Do you now understand?\"\n\nThe Lord of Yu did not equal the Lord of Tai. Li notes: *The Lord of Tai refers to the Great Court Clan.* The Lord of Yu concealed benevolence to entice others—though he won the people, he had not yet transcended the realm of the artificial. The Lord of Tai lay at ease, rose unhurriedly, now taking himself for a horse, now for an ox. His knowledge was true to reality, his virtue utterly genuine, and he had never entered the realm of the artificial.\n\nThe Lord of Yu harbored and concealed the Dao of benevolence to bind the hearts of men—thus he too won the people. Yet he still emerged from human contrivance, unlike one who abides in non-contrivance, where all things commune without communion. Hence it is said: *He had not yet transcended the realm of the artificial.* As for the Lord of Tai of High Antiquity, he dwelt in natural spontaneity, without deliberate action. Sometimes he took himself for a horse, sometimes for an ox, with no fixed designation. This was because the Lord of Tai’s knowledge was truly authentic, his virtue profoundly real. Unlike the Lord of Yu, who embraced benevolence to entice others, his state was not intentional. Thus it is said: *He had never entered the realm of the artificial.* The phrase *had not yet transcended* gives rise to the phrase *had never entered.*\n\nJian Wu met Jie Yu the Madman. Jie Yu asked: \"What did Ri Zhongshi tell you?\" Jian Wu replied: \"He instructed me that a ruler must issue ordinances based on his own person, establishing enduring standards. Using his own conduct as a model, people would dare not disobey and would be transformed thereby.\"\n\nJie Yu said: \"This is deceptive virtue. In governing the world, it would be like crossing the sea by digging a river or making a mosquito bear a mountain. If you use standards to regulate conduct, people would drown in the sea; digging a river would be impossible; a mosquito could not bear a mountain. Does the sage’s governance concern externals? He rectifies himself and then acts, firmly accomplishing only what he is capable of. Does the sage’s governance extend to externals? He merely fulfills what lies within his nature. He rectifies himself and then acts, firmly and truthfully doing only what he can. Moreover, birds fly high to avoid the harm of arrows and nets, and field mice burrow deep beneath sacred mounds to escape the peril of fumigation and excavation—yet you would call these two creatures witless! If a ruler sought to align people with laws and measures, they would all flee to avoid them. Birds and mice know to avoid harm—how much more so humans! Would you call these two creatures witless?\"\n\nTian Gen wandered to Yin Yang and arrived at the banks of the Liao River, where he encountered an unnamed man and asked: \"I beg to inquire about governing the world.\" The unnamed man replied: \"Begone.\"\n\nYou are a vulgar man—why do you ask so impatiently? Your question brings no joy. I am now about to become human with the Creator of Things. When weary, I shall ride the boundless bird, soaring beyond the Six Directions to wander in the realm of Nothingness, dwelling in the vast and open wilds. Why do you trouble my heart with governance of the world?\n\nThe unnamed man replied: \"Let your mind wander in stillness, harmonize your qi with the void, follow things as they are without imposing your private will—and the world will be well-ordered.\"\n\nYang Ziju visited Lao Dan and said: \"Suppose there were a man swift and strong, keen and unyielding, penetrating and clear in all things, tireless in learning the Dao. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?\"\n\nLao Dan replied: \"In the eyes of the sage, he is but a convict laborer, bound by skill and toil, wearing out his body and startling his mind. Moreover, the patterns of tigers and leopards attract hunters, just as the agility of gibbons and macaques brings them to the leash of the trapper’s hound. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?\"\n\nYang Ziju, startled, asked: \"Then may I inquire about the governance of an enlightened king?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"The governance of an enlightened king covers all under heaven yet seems not to originate from himself. His transformation lends to the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. No name can be given to his achievement, and all things delight in themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in Nothingness.\"\n\nIn Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Cheng, who knew the life and death, survival and perishing, fortune and misfortune, long life and early death of men, predicting them by year, month, or day with godlike precision. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. When Liezi saw him, he was enchanted by his art and returned to tell Huzhi: \"At first I thought your Dao was supreme, but now I see there is something even greater.\"\n\nHuzhi said: \"I have shown you only its outward form, not its inner reality. Do you truly believe you have attained the Dao? I have shared with you only its surface, not its essence. How can you claim to have obtained the Dao?\"\n\n\"A flock of hens without a rooster—how then could they lay eggs? *The Kinship of the Three* states: 'A hen cannot lay eggs alone,' for to pursue a one-sided art is to fail in attaining the Dao. This illustrates where Liezi has yet to grasp its inner reality. Yet if you set the Dao in opposition to the world, can you truly expect others to believe you? If you insist on elevating the Dao above the world, how can you demand that people trust you? Thus, they will turn away from you.\"\n\nHuzhi said, \"Bring him here and let me test him.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Cheng to meet Huzhi. When they emerged, Ji Cheng said to Liezi, \"Alas! Your master is dead. He cannot live. He will not last ten days. I saw something strange—his qi resembled damp ashes.\"\n\nLiezi entered and, weeping until his robe was soaked, told Huzhi what had transpired. Huzhi said, \"I showed him the earthly pattern—still and unshaken, neither stirred nor disturbed. He saw only my sealed virtue-mechanism. Bring him again.\"\n\n\"Mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees are the earth’s patterns. When grasses and trees sprout, they rest in tranquil stillness, undisturbed, each following its own nature without need of correction. As the *Scripture of Salvation* says: 'The divine wind is silent; mountains and seas conceal the clouds. The heavens are free of drifting haze; the four qi are bright and clear. In a single land, earth and soil, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees lie level as one, no longer high or low.' This is what I mean by the sealed virtue-mechanism—concealed and unseeable. I showed him this, so he could not fathom me. Tell Liezi to bring him again tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Cheng to see Huzhi once more. When they emerged, Ji Cheng said to Liezi, \"Fortunate that your master met me! He is restored—fully alive! I saw his sealed adaptability.\"\n\nLiezi entered and reported this to Huzhi. Huzhi said, \"Earlier, I showed him heaven and earth—names and realities could not enter his mind, yet the mechanism stirred from the depths. He glimpsed only my good-mechanism. Bring him again.\"\n\n\"I saw his sealed adaptability—within concealment, there was flexibility, subtly different from yesterday’s sight. Sealed adaptability contrasts with sealed virtue. 'Heaven and earth' refers to the twelve celestial stems, the expanse of heaven. This term pairs with 'earthly pattern.' Earth governs stillness; heaven governs movement. By showing him heaven and earth, I meant that outwardly, names and realities could not penetrate his heart, while inwardly, the mechanism arose from the deepest place. Ji Cheng barely perceived the faint stirrings of my good-mechanism, yet much remained beyond his grasp. Tell him to return tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Cheng to see Huzhi again. When they emerged, Ji Cheng said, \"Your master is unsettled—I cannot divine him. Let him compose himself, and I will try again.\"\n\nLiezi entered and told Huzhi. Huzhi said, \"I just showed him the supreme harmony where nothing prevails—he saw only my balanced qi-mechanism. The depths of the *ni*-whirlpool, where Liezi writes *pan* (rice-water), should read *shen* (sediment), also meaning 'juice.' A still-water *shen* forms a deep pool; a flowing-water *shen* forms a deep pool. There are nine names for such pools, and here I used three. Bring him again after he has fasted to unify his mind.\"\n\n\"Supreme harmony\" refers to the great equilibrium, akin to the \"great peace.\" It lies between the sealed virtue-mechanism and the good-mechanism, with nothing surpassing it. The balanced qi-mechanism stands between earthly pattern and heaven-earth, where movement and stillness are evenly matched—this is equilibrium. The term \"balanced\" contrasts with \"adaptability\" above. By showing him the supreme harmony where nothing prevails, I meant the balanced qi-mechanism.\n\nThe *ni*-whirlpool is where the *ni* lingers. *Pan* is rice-water, the foam on a deep pool’s surface. A still-water *pan* forms a deep pool when water flows above but pools below. Where the *ni* lingers, where still water pools, where flowing water pools—all are called deep pools. The *Liezi*’s \"Yellow Emperor\" chapter lists nine names for deep pools: the *ni*-whirlpool’s *pan*, the still-water’s *pan*, the flowing-water’s *pan*, the overflowing-water’s *pan*, the surging-water’s *pan*, the rushing-water’s *pan*, the dammed-water’s *pan*, the Fen River’s *pan*, and the rich-water’s *pan*. *The Master of Huainan* also speaks of the nine-jade deep pools. Here, only three are mentioned, leaving others unused. The still-water deep pool exemplifies the earthly pattern.\n\nThe *Du*-virtue mechanism remains utterly unmoving. The *ni*-whirlpool’s deep pool serves as a metaphor for heaven and earth. Though the adept’s mechanism resembles still deep-pool water, the presence of *ni* coiling within reveals a subtle motion amid stillness. The flowing-water deep pool illustrates the supreme harmony of unopposable forces, the balanced qi-mechanism—where water flows above and pools below, each half in perfect equilibrium—thus serving as an analogy for the *taichong* protective qi.\n\nIf one cannot grasp these three examples, how could one comprehend the rest? Therefore, permission was granted for another encounter. The next day, he was again brought before Master Huzǐ. Before standing firmly, the visitor lost composure and fled. Master Huzǐ said, \"Pursue him.\" Liezi chased but could not overtake him. Returning, he reported to Master Huzǐ: \"He has vanished, he is lost—I could not reach him.\"\n\nFrom his perspective, it was *vanished*; from ours, it was *lost*. Master Huzǐ said, \"Earlier, I showed him what had never yet departed from my lineage. I met him with emptiness and *weiyi* (yielding compliance), leaving him unsure of who was who, so he took me for a follower, for a drifting current—hence his flight. My lineage is that of the great lineage-master. *Weiyi* means compliance. *Unsure of who was who* means no distinction between self and other. *Follower* describes one who trails like a younger brother after an elder. *Drifting current* likens one to a wave carried by the flow. Though transformations are boundless, they never depart from the great lineage. The great lineage is the root-source of the Dao—nothing but emptiness, without division between you and me. Taking me for a follower or drifting current, he could not fathom my nature and so fled.\"\n\nThereafter, Liezi returned home, believing he had never truly begun to learn. For three years, he did not venture out, cooking for his wife, eating like a pig eats human food, remaining indifferent to all affairs. He carved away ornamentation to restore simplicity, standing solitary as an unhewn block. *Carved away ornamentation to restore simplicity* means stripping away embellishment to return to plainness.\n\nIn this tumultuous age of divided domains, one should conclude life with this alone. Do not be a master of fame, a repository of schemes, a bearer of tasks, or a lord of knowledge. Embody the boundless and wander without trace. Exhaust what is received from heaven without claiming attainment—nothing but emptiness, echoing the earlier *emptiness*.\n\nThe sage’s mind functions like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without hoarding, thus mastering things without harm. Like a mirror’s clarity, it neither welcomes arriving things nor sends off departing ones, merely reflecting without injury from phenomena. The following text explains how one becomes harmed.\n\nThe Emperor of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Emperor of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Emperor of the Central Realm was Hundun. Shu and Hu would often meet in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them with great kindness. Shu and Hu conspired to repay Hundun’s virtue, saying: “All people have seven apertures—for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing. Only this one has none. Let us try to bore them for him.” Each day they bored one aperture, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.\n\nThis chapter is titled \"Fit for Emperors and Kings,\" and thus all it speaks of concerns the affairs of emperors and kings. At the chapter’s end, the passage where Master Huzi reveals himself to Ji Xian clarifies the Dao of responding to the world in accord with the times, ultimately returning to the theme of the Emperors of the Southern and Northern Seas.\n\nThe seven Inner Chapters are the most refined and precise, each first given a title before being composed.\n\n*The True Classic of Southern Florescence*, Following the Original Text, Scroll Eight—Concluded\n*The True Classic of Southern Florescence*, Following the Original Text, Scroll Nine\nRecorded by Luo Miandao of Zhufeng in Luling; collated by his disciple Peng Xiang\n\n**Outer Chapters: \"Webbed Toes\"**\nThe first seven chapters each have specially crafted titles, and the meaning of the chapter concludes with them. From this point onward, titles are taken from the opening characters of each chapter without particular intent, serving merely to elaborate on earlier themes.\n\nWebbed toes and extra fingers emerge from nature yet exceed virtue; wens and tumors emerge from form yet exceed nature. *Webbed toes* refers to the big toe being joined to the second toe. *Extra fingers* refers to additional fingers growing beside the hand. *Wens* are growths of flesh attached to the body, hence called *attached wens*; tumors are masses suspended from the body, hence called *hanging tumors*. *Nature* means life; *virtue* means attainment.\n\nExcess denotes superfluity. Webbed toes and extra fingers arise from heaven’s creation, yet from the perspective of what humans attain, they are superfluous; wens and tumors emerge after physical form, yet from the perspective of heaven’s creation, they are superfluous. Those who employ仁义 (humaneness and rightness) in manifold ways lodge them within the five viscera, yet this is not the true alignment of the Dao’s virtue/power.\n\n*Manifold ways* means multiple approaches. *Lodged within the five viscera* refers to associations such as the liver-spirit with humaneness and the lung-spirit with rightness.\n\nThus, what is conjoined to the foot is but useless flesh; what branches from the hand is but an extraneous digit. The phrase *manifold ways* extends the analogy of webbed toes and extra fingers to the dispositions of the five viscera—excessive deviation in the practice of humaneness and rightness, and over-elaboration in the application of intelligence.\n\nThus, what is conjoined to clarity disrupts the five colors, indulges in ornate patterns, and dazzles with azure, yellow, embroidered robes, and ceremonial garments—is this not the case with Li Zhu? Sima [Biao] states: \"A man of the Yellow Emperor’s time who could see the tip of an autumn hair at a hundred paces.\" Another account says he could see the point of a needle at a thousand *li*. Mencius calls him Li Lou.\n\nWhat is excessive in hearing disrupts the five tones, indulges in the six pitch-pipes, and resounds with metal, stone, silk, bamboo, Huangzhong, and Dalü—is this not the case with Shi Kuang?\n\nWhat branches from humaneness plucks at virtue and obstructs nature to garner fame, causing the world to clamor in support of unattainable standards—is this not the case with Zeng [Can] and Shi [Qiu]?\n\n*Plucks* means to draw out. *Clamor* is like the stirring of a reed-organ’s pipes. *Zeng* refers to Zeng Can. *Shi* refers to Shi Qiu.\n\nThose who are paired in sophistry pile tiles and knot cords to craft elusive phrases, roaming their minds amid the rigid debates of \"hard\" and \"white,\" \"same\" and \"different\"—is this not the exhaustion of half-step reputations in useless words? And are not Yang [Zhu] and Mo [Di] the very ones?\n\n*Piling tiles* means stacking vessels without toppling them. *Knotting cords* means untying them with skill—small tricks of dexterity, likening the sophist’s art. *Elusive phrases* are evasive words. *Exhaustion* means weariness. *Half-step* refers to half a pace, as if the sophist’s labor were that of a worn-out man hobbling forward.\n\nThus, all these are the many paired and branching paths, not the ultimate correctness of the world. That which is truly correct—here, the first *correct* may be a scribal error for *ultimate*—does not lose the truth of its nature and destiny. Therefore, what is joined is not called *paired*, and what branches is not called *forked* (a term for feet with extra toes); what is long is not called excessive, and what is short is not called deficient. Hence, though the teal’s legs are short, lengthening them brings sorrow; though the crane’s legs are long, shortening them brings grief. Thus, what is long by nature must not be cut, and what is short by nature must not be extended—there is nothing to remove or add that would not cause distress.\n\nIs it not that humaneness and rightness run counter to human nature? Why else do those humane men bear so much sorrow? Moreover, those whose toes are paired—severing them brings weeping; those whose hands have extra fingers—cutting them brings wailing. Whether in excess of the proper number or deficient, their sorrow is the same. Now, the humane men of this age gaze with bleary eyes at the world’s calamities, while the inhumane tear at the truth of their nature and destiny to glut themselves on wealth and honor. Is it not that humaneness and rightness run counter to human nature?\n\nSince the time after the Three Dynasties, why has the world been so clamorously noisy? *Clamorous* (pronounced *xiāo*) is a sound—since the time after the Three Dynasties, why has the world’s discourse on humaneness and rightness been so noisily clamorous?\n\nThose who rely on hooks, marking lines, compasses, and squares to achieve correctness are carving away their nature; those who depend on inked cords, glue, and lacquer to achieve solidity are encroaching upon their virtue. Bending and folding with rites and music, cooing and murmuring about humaneness and rightness to soothe the world’s heart—this is to lose what is constant and natural. The world has its constancy: the curved do not need hooks, the straight do not need marking lines, the round do not need compasses, the square do not need squares, adhesion does not need glue and lacquer, and binding does not need ropes. Thus, the world grows abundantly of itself, unaware of how it grows; all attain their due, unaware of how they attain it. Therefore, from ancient times to the present, there is no duality—it cannot be diminished.\n\n*A hook* is a tool for drawing curves. *Abundantly* means flourishingly. The nine-character phrase thus treats ancient and modern as one, without sign of decay. Then why should humaneness and rightness cling like glue, lacquer, and ropes, wandering between the Dao and virtue? It only confounds the world. Zhuangzi and Laozi exalted the Dao and virtue while belittling humaneness and rightness, hence these words.\n\nMinor delusion confuses direction; major delusion alters one’s nature. How do we know this is so? Since the time of Yu’s dynasty, when humaneness and rightness were raised to disturb the world, none have not rushed to answer the call of humaneness and rightness. Is this not to exchange one’s nature for humaneness and rightness? Let us test this claim: since the time after the Three Dynasties, the world has not failed to exchange its nature for things.\n\nThe petty man sacrifices himself for profit; the scholar sacrifices himself for fame; the grandee sacrifices himself for his house; the sage sacrifices himself for the world. Though these several types differ in their undertakings and their reputations bear different names, their injury to their nature and their self-sacrifice are one.\n\nZang and Gu—according to the *Fangyan*, in the northern borders of Qi and the northern outskirts of Yan, a male who marries a slave woman is called *Zang*, and a female who marries a slave is called *Gu*; thus, taking *Zang* as a name for the good, they also name the other *Gu*—were two men who herded sheep together and lost them all. When asked what Zang was doing, he was found clutching a bamboo slip, reading a book.\n\nWhen asked what Gu was doing, he was found playing *bo* and *sai*—*ce* (bamboo slips, two feet and four inches long); *sai* (to be read as *xi*, as in *The Book of Han*: Wuqiu Shouwang was skilled at *ge*, with the Five Palace Attendants’ note: *bo* and *sai*)—to pass the time. Though these two men differed in their pursuits, their loss of sheep was the same.\n\nBoyi died for fame beneath Shouyang, while Robber Zhi died for profit upon Dongling. Though these two men differed in what they died for, their injury to life and harm to nature were the same. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? The world is wholly given to self-sacrifice. Those who sacrifice themselves for benevolence and righteousness are commonly called gentlemen; those who sacrifice themselves for wealth and property are commonly called petty men. Though their sacrifices are one, some are called gentlemen, some petty men. Yet if we consider their injury to life and harm to nature, then Robber Zhi is no different from Boyi—what room is there to distinguish between gentleman and petty man?\n\nMoreover, those whose nature is bound to benevolence and righteousness, though as accomplished as Zengzi and Shi Yu, are not what I call truly good. Those whose nature is bound to the five flavors, though as discerning as Yu’er—*Shizi* says: \"Yu’er seasoned the ruler’s food with ginger\"; *Huainanzi* writes it as *Shen’er*—are not what I call truly good. Those whose nature is bound to the five tones, though as skilled as Music Master Kuang, are not what I call truly keen of hearing. Those whose nature is bound to the five colors, though as perceptive as Li Zhu, are not what I call truly clear of sight.\n\nWhat I call good is not the practice of benevolence and righteousness, but the preservation of one’s inherent power alone. What I call good is not the pursuit of benevolence and righteousness, but the fulfillment of one’s nature and destiny. What I call keen of hearing is not hearing others, but hearing oneself. What I call clear of sight is not seeing others, but seeing oneself.\n\nFor one who does not see himself but sees others, who does not attain for himself but attains for others, attains what others attain yet does not attain what he himself should attain—such a one follows others’ fulfillment without fulfilling himself. Whether Robber Zhi or Boyi, to follow others’ fulfillment without fulfilling oneself is equally perverse and excessive.\n\nI am ashamed before the Dao and its virtue; thus, above, I dare not adopt the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, and below, I dare not indulge in perverse and excessive actions.\n\n*The Nanhua True Scripture, Following the Original Text, Scroll Nine* ends here.\n*The Nanhua True Scripture, Following the Original Text, Scroll Ten* begins.\n\nBamboo Peak of Lulin, recorded by Luo Miandao, collated by disciple Peng Xiang\n\n*Outer Chapters: \"Horse's Hooves\"*\n\nThe horse—its hooves can tread frost and snow, its coat can ward off wind and cold. It grazes on grass and drinks from streams, lifts its feet to gallop across the land. Though there be ritual terraces and grand chambers, they are of no use to it.\n\nZheng Xuan, the Han scholar, notes: \"In ancient texts, *yi* (義) was written for *yi* (儀).\" The *yitai* refers to the \"terrace gate\" mentioned in the *Jiao Te Sheng*—a raised earthen platform with a roofed structure, its center serving as the gate, thus establishing the model for palace architecture. Even today, the term *yimen* persists. The heavens, too, have their \"Grand Terrace\" court. The *luzhen* denotes the main hall. To speak of *yitai* and *luzhen* is to encompass the entirety of palace architecture.\n\nThen came Bo Le—pronounced *Luo*, surnamed Sun, given name Yang—renowned for his mastery of horses. The *Star Canon of the Shi Clan* states: \"Bo Le is the name of a celestial star governing the finest steeds of heaven.\" Sun Yang’s skill in driving horses earned him this name. He declared, \"I excel at managing horses.\" He branded them, pared their hooves, carved into their flesh, and flayed their joints. He bound them with bridles and halters, tethered them to blackened racks—of these horses, twelve or thirteen in ten would perish. He starved and parched them, drove them at full gallop, drilled them into uniformity. Before them lay the torment of bit and rein, behind them the threat of whip and goad—by then, more than half the horses had died.\n\nThe *jue* is the mouthpiece; the *shi* refers to the ornamental tassels beneath the horse’s jaw.\n\nThe potter says: \"I excel at working clay.\" He kneads the earth.\n\nThe round conforms to the compass, the square to the carpenter’s square. The craftsman says: “I excel at working wood.” The curved meets the hook, the straight aligns with the marking-line. Yet do clay and wood by nature desire to conform to compass, square, hook, and line? Still, generation after generation, people praise Bo Le for his skill in managing horses, and potters and carpenters for their mastery of clay and wood. This is also the error of those who govern the world.\n\nI believe those who truly excel at governing the world do not act thus. The people possess an enduring nature: they know to clothe themselves and till the soil to feed themselves—this is called shared virtue. Unified yet impartial, this is called the freedom of Heaven. Thus, in the age of utmost virtue, their movements are steady, their gaze unassuming. At that time, mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes no boats or bridges. The myriad things flourished together, bound to their native lands. Birds and beasts gathered in flocks and herds, grasses and trees grew to their fullness. Thus, one could lead birds and beasts by tether and wander among them, or climb to peer into the nests of magpies and crows. In the age of utmost virtue, humans dwelt alongside birds and beasts, their kind mingling with the myriad things. How could one distinguish between noble and base? Alike in their lack of cunning, their virtue remained unbroken; alike in their lack of desire, they were called uncarved simplicity. In uncarved simplicity, the people’s nature was fulfilled.\n\nYet when the sage arose, he hobbled and strained for benevolence, tiptoed and stretched for righteousness—and the world began to doubt. Steady and solid, not hollow or frivolous. Obscure and unadorned, not bright or dazzling. *Biexie* (limping) and *qiji* (tiptoeing) describe forced effort, thus illustrating the contrivance of benevolence and righteousness. Indulgence became music, restraint became ritual—and the world began to divide. *Chanman* (indulgence) means excess, like overflowing waters. *Zhaipi* (restraint) means picking out and correcting what is deviant.\n\nIf unhewn simplicity is not destroyed, who would fashion sacrificial goblets? If white jade is not shattered, who would carve ceremonial tablets? If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, why seek benevolence and righteousness? If nature and emotion remain unsevered, why employ ritual and music? If the five colors are not disordered, who would create patterned adornments? If the five tones are not confused, who would harmonize them with the six pitch-pipes? To mar simplicity into implements is the fault of the craftsman; to ruin the Dao and virtue for the sake of benevolence and righteousness is the error of the sage.\n\nNow, returning to the horse as a metaphor, let us advance the argument further.\n\nWhen dwelling on land, horses eat grass and drink water; when pleased, they entwine necks in mutual affection; when angered, they turn their backs to kick one another. In joy, they cross necks and nuzzle in harmony; in fury, they part their backs to strike with their hooves. For when horses kick, they always direct their feet backward—hence the phrase \"turning their backs to kick.\" Thus, horses already possess this knowledge.\n\nYet when yokes and crossbars are imposed upon them—*heng* being the horizontal wood at the front of the carriage, *e* (the yoke) the device that restrains the horse’s neck—horses learn to feign armor’s edge, to sense the chokehold of city gates, to grow haughty and unruly, to deceive by accepting the bit, and to slip free of the reins. *Jie* means armor, for warhorses must wear it. *Yin* refers to city gates, which restrain treachery. *E* means to grasp, as city gates grasp and hold back villainy. *Zhiman* means arrogance and defiance. *Guixian* means feigning acceptance of the bit. *Qiepei* means stealing the reins beyond control. This describes how horses, familiar with human ways, foresee the signs of armor before donning it, anticipate the restraint of city gates before passing through, and thus become unmanageable—deceiving with the bit, slipping the reins—exhibiting such behavior.\n\nTherefore, that horses possess this knowledge and can even become thieves is the fault of Bo Le.\n\nIn the age of the赫胥氏, people knew not what to do nor where to go; they played with food in their mouths and wandered with bellies full. The people had already attained this state. But when sages came, bending and shaping ritual and music to correct the forms of the world, dangling benevolence and righteousness like suspended objects to soothe the hearts of the world, people began to stretch on tiptoe for knowledge, to vie for profit, and could not be stopped. This, too, is the fault of the sages.\n\nOne who hangs an object makes others stretch to reach it.\n\n*End of the Tenth Scroll of the Xunben Edition of the Nan Hua Zhen Jing*\n*Beginning of the Eleventh Scroll of the Xunben Edition of the Nan Hua Zhen Jing*\n\nLujing Bamboo Peak’s Luo Miandao, as recorded by his disciple Peng Xiang, annotates:\n\n**Outer Chapters: \"Opening the Satchel\"**\n\nWhen one intends to pry open a satchel—*qu* (胠), meaning the armpit—it is as though reaching in from beneath the arm. Thieves who probe into bags to steal necessitate precautions: they must fasten cords and seals, *jianteng* (缄縢), the tools of binding and marking, and secure bolts and locks. *Jue* (鐍), pronounced as in *guxue* (古穴), refers to the bolt’s tongue; *jiong* (扃) means to latch. This is what the world calls \"wisdom.\"\n\nYet when a great thief arrives, he hoists the chest, shoulders the satchel, and carries off the bag, fearing only that the cords, seals, bolts, and locks are not secure enough. Thus, what was once called wisdom is it not merely amassing spoils for the great thief?\n\nLet us examine this: Is there any so-called wisdom in the world that does not accumulate for the great thief? Is there any so-called sageliness that does not guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so?\n\nIn ancient times, the cities and towns of Qi stood in sight of one another, the cries of chickens and dogs audible between them. Nets and snares spread wide, plows and hoes pierced deep—*lei* (耒) being the handle of the plow, *nou* (耨) the weeding tool, as described in the *Shuowen*: \"a blade six inches long, a handle three feet, its edge two inches broad.\" Within a territory of over two thousand *li*, encompassing all within its four borders, the establishment of ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain, the governance of cities, villages, districts, and hamlets—was there ever a time these did not follow the models of the sages?\n\nYet Tian Chengzi slew the ruler of Qi in a single day and stole his state. What he stole was not merely the state—he seized along with it the sagely laws of wisdom. Thus, Tian Chengzi bore the name of a bandit, yet lived in the security of Yao and Shun. Small states dared not condemn him; great states dared not punish him. For twelve generations, he held Qi—was this not the theft of the state *and* its sagely laws to safeguard his bandit’s life?\n\nTian Chengzi is Chen Chengzi Heng. In the twenty-second year of Duke Zhuang’s reign in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Chen killed its crown prince, Yu Kou. Gongzi Wan, styled Jingzhong, fearing disaster, fled to Qi and became Duke Huan’s minister of works, concealing his clan name as Tian, for Chen and Tian sound alike. Five generations later, Lizi Qi became a minister to Duke Jing, collecting taxes from the people with a small measure but distributing grain with a large one, thereby winning the people’s favor and seizing control of Qi’s governance. Finally, his descendant Chengzi Heng assassinated Duke Jian, enthroned Duke Ping, and received fiefs larger than the duke’s own, ruling through Xiangzi Ban. Zhuangzi writes this in the time of King Xuan, hence \"eleven generations held Qi.\" Though Tian He had not yet usurped the state, the replacement of Jiang by Tian had already appeared in divination, so it is counted together.\n\nLet us examine further: Is there any so-called supreme wisdom in the world that does not accumulate for the great thief? Is there any so-called supreme sageliness that does not guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so?\n\nIn former times, Long Feng was beheaded, Bi Gan was disemboweled, Xi Zhong was torn apart, and Wu Zixu was torn to shreds—*mi* (靡) meaning *xumi* (胥靡), where *xu* (胥) is \"mutual\" and *mi* (靡) is \"to follow,\" a lighter punishment where offenders, clad in coarse cloth and bound with ropes, labored in chains. Though these four were virtuous, they could not escape execution.\n\nThus, the followers of Robber Zhi asked him: \"Does theft also have a Way?\" Zhi replied: \"Where can one go without a Way? To divine the treasures hidden in a chamber—that is sageliness. To enter first—that is courage. To exit last—that is righteousness. To know what is possible and what is not—that is wisdom. To divide spoils equally—that is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world has ever become a great thief.\"\n\nFrom this, we see that the good cannot stand without the Way of the sages, nor can Zhi act without it. Since the world’s good people are few and the unvirtuous many, the sages benefit the world little but harm it much. Thus it is said:\n\nWhen the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold;\nWhen Lu’s wine was thin, Handan was besieged.\n\nAs the *Shiwen* explains: Handan was the capital of Zhao. King Xuan of Chu summoned the feudal lords, but Duke Gong of Lu arrived late with weak wine. Enraged, the king sought to humiliate him, but the duke refused, saying: \"I am a descendant of the Duke of Zhou, elder among the feudal lords, practicing the rites and music of the Son of Heaven, with merit in the Zhou house. Though my wine was improper, to reproach its thinness is excessive.\" He departed without leave. The king, furious, sent troops with Qi to attack Lu. King Hui of Liang had long wished to strike Zhao but feared Chu, which was aiding Lu. Thus, Liang besieged Handan. Events follow one another—another account, from Xu Shen’s commentary on the *Huainanzi*: At a gathering of feudal lords, Lu presented wine to the King of Chu. Lu’s wine was thin, Zhao’s thick. The king’s wine steward demanded wine from Zhao, but Zhao refused. The steward, enraged, swapped Zhao’s thick wine for Lu’s thin one and presented it to the king, who then besieged Handan on the pretext of Zhao’s weak wine.\n\nWhen sages arise, great thieves appear. Abandon the attack on sages, release the restraint on bandits, and the world will begin to be ordered. When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. Once sages die, great thieves will not rise, and the world will be at peace without incident.\n\nAs long as sages do not die, great thieves will not cease. Though one may exalt sages to govern the world, this is but to enrich Robber Zhi. Fashion measures and bushels to quantify, and they will be stolen along with the measures; fashion scales and weights to weigh, and they will be stolen along with the scales; fashion tallies and seals to authenticate, and they will be stolen along with the tallies; fashion benevolence and righteousness to correct, and they will be stolen along with benevolence and righteousness.\n\nHow do we know this is so? Those who steal a belt-hook are executed, while those who steal a state become lords. Where the gates of lords stand, benevolence and righteousness abide. Are these not the theft of benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom? Thus, in the wake of great thieves—following the example of Deng Xi—lords arise, seizing benevolence and righteousness along with the gains of measures, scales, tallies, and seals. Though offered the rewards of high rank, none can be induced; though threatened with the axe, none can be deterred. That such great profit for Robber Zhi cannot be restrained is the fault of the sages.\n\nThus it is said: \"The fish must not leave the depths; the state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others.\" Those sages are the state’s sharpest tools, not what should be displayed to the world. Therefore, sever sageliness and cast off wisdom, and great thieves will cease; pluck out jade and shatter pearls, and petty thieves will not arise; burn tallies and break seals, and the people will return to simplicity; smash the steelyard and snap the balance, and the people will know no contention. To \"use simplicity to harmonize seals, use contention to harmonize scales\"—here, the text plays with words. Exhaust and destroy the world’s sagely laws, and only then may the people be fit for discussion. Confound the six pitch-pipes, melt down the zithers and lutes, deafen the ears of Music-Master Kuang, and the world will begin to preserve its hearing. Erase patterns, scatter the five colors, blind the eyes of Li Zhu, and the world will begin to preserve its sight. Break the marking-line and discard the compass and square, sever the fingers of Craftsman Chui, and the world will begin to possess its skill. Thus it is said: \"Great skill appears clumsy.\"\n\nCut short the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silence the mouths of Yang and Mo, cast aside benevolence and righteousness, and the world’s virtue will begin to merge in profound unity. When people preserve their sight, the world will not be dazzled; when they preserve their hearing, the world will not be burdened; when they preserve their knowledge, the world will not be deluded; when they preserve their virtue, the world will not be perverse. Those like Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo, Music-Master Kuang, Craftsman Chui, and Li Zhu all set their virtue outward and thereby dazzle and confuse the world—useless to the law.\n\nDo you alone not know of the age of perfect virtue? In ancient times, under the reigns of Rongcheng, Dating, Bohuang, Zhongyang, Lilu, Lixu, Xuanyuan, Hexu, Zunlu, Zhu Rong, Fuxi, and Shennong, the people knotted cords for use. They savored their food, admired their clothing, delighted in their customs, and rested content in their dwellings. Neighboring states were within sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs carried to one another, yet the people grew old and died without ever traveling between them. In such an age, perfect governance was already achieved.\n\nNow, however, it has come to this: the people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, \"In such-and-such a place there is a worthy,\" and carrying provisions, they rush toward him. They abandon their parents at home and forsake their lords’ service abroad. Footprints crisscross the borders of the states; carriage tracks entangle a thousand *li* beyond. This is the fault of those above who prize knowledge. If those above truly prize knowledge and lack the Way, the world will be thrown into great chaos.\n\nHow do we know this is so? When knowledge of bows, crossbows, nets, and snares multiplies, birds are thrown into confusion above; when knowledge of hooks, bait, traps, and weirs multiplies, fish are thrown into confusion in the water; when knowledge of fences, nets, and traps multiplies, beasts are thrown into confusion in the marshes; when knowledge of deceit, gradual poison, contention, sophistry, \"hard and white,\" and \"same and different\" multiplies, the common folk are bewildered by disputation. (Here, the text follows the earlier pattern, presenting three examples: \"deceit and gradual poison\" refers to knowledge used to deceive, accumulating into poison; \"hard and white\" refers to obstinately insisting on whiteness; \"same and different\" refers to conflating difference into sameness—all terms found in the writings of Gongsun Long. \"Contention\" means competing for superiority; \"sophistry\" means shifting and evasive argument. Those who obstinately insist on whiteness and dispute it engage in contention, making others shift and evade. \"Dissolving\" means scattering; \"dirt\" refers to the grime of the body. \"Dissolving dirt and sameness\" means scattering sameness as if shedding grime. The first phrase speaks of knowledge, the next two of disputation.)\n\nThus, the world is repeatedly thrown into great chaos, and the blame lies in the love of knowledge. The world all knows to seek what it does not know yet does not know to seek what it already knows; all knows to condemn what it does not consider good yet does not know to condemn what it already considers good. Thus, great chaos arises. Above, it confounds the brightness of sun and moon; below, it scorches the essence of mountains and rivers; in between, it topples the operations of the four seasons. Even the tiniest wriggling creatures and the smallest sprouting plants lose their nature. How severe is the chaos wrought by the love of knowledge—this has been the case since the Three Dynasties and after!\n\nAbandon the people of all kinds (here, \"kind\" is read in the rising tone, meaning categories—one type alone, without distinction or excellence) and delight instead in the flattery of the fawning; forsake the tranquil and effortless and delight instead in the restless scheming of the clever. Such restless scheming has already thrown the world into chaos.\n\n*The Eleventh Scroll of the Circulating Edition of the True Classic of Southern Florescence is complete.*\n*The Twelfth Scroll of the Circulating Edition of the True Classic of Southern Florescence.*\n\nLu Lingzhu of Bamboo Peak in Luling, recorded by disciple Luo Miandao and collated by Peng Xiang.\n\n**Outer Chapters: \"In You\"**\n\nWe hear of \"in-you-ing\" the world, but never of governing the world. To \"in\" it is to fear the world may indulge its nature; to \"you\" it is to fear the world may alter its virtue. If the world neither indulges its nature nor alters its virtue, is there any need to govern it?\n\nWhen Yao governed the world, he made it brim with joy—people delighted in their nature, yet this was not tranquility. When Jie governed the world, he made it languish in exhaustion—people suffered in their nature, yet this was not contentment. That which is neither tranquil nor content is not virtue; and nothing lacking virtue can endure long. The phrase \"in-you\" may have been current in those days, but today it reads strangely. As in the *Book of Songs*, where \"you-mi\" appears, \"in\" suggests letting things be as they are, while \"you\" means to allow. \"You\" is to be lenient. To \"in-you\" the world is to act without contrivance. To govern the world is to impose rites, music, punishments, and policies. If one \"ins\" and \"yous\" it, how can there be governance?\n\nThe exuberance of \"brimming with joy\" arises from a lack of \"inning\"; the exhaustion of \"languishing\" stems from a lack of \"you-ing.\" When one is excessively joyful, one aids the yang; when excessively angry, one aids the yin. \"Aids\" means to strengthen. Joy belongs to yang; anger to yin. When yin and yang are balanced in the body, there is no illness. But if joy is excessive, it strengthens yang to dominance; if anger is excessive, it strengthens yin to dominance. When both yin and yang are over-aided, the four seasons fail to arrive, the harmony of cold and heat is disrupted, and the body is harmed in return. This analogy of the four seasons’ yin and yang illustrates the yin and yang within the human body.\n\nIf people’s joy and anger are misplaced, their dwellings unsettled, their thoughts restless, and their conduct inconsistent, then the world begins with the unruly and the fierce, and later produces the deeds of Robber Zhi and Zeng Shen. \"Inconsistent conduct\" means actions that start but fail to follow through with order. \"Unruly and fierce\" describes those who cannot be controlled.\n\nThus, even if the entire world were marshaled to reward the good, it would not suffice; even if the entire world were marshaled to punish the wicked, it would not be enough. The world is too vast for rewards and punishments to be adequate. Yet since the Three Dynasties, rulers have clamored endlessly over rewards and punishments—how could they have had leisure to preserve the natural state of their lives? This passage on rewards and punishments arises from the discussion of joy and anger.\n\nMoreover, to delight in brightness is to indulge in form; to delight in keen hearing is to indulge in sound; to delight in benevolence is to disorder virtue; to delight in righteousness is to defy principle; to delight in ritual is to turn it into a craft; to delight in music is to turn it into licentiousness; to delight in sagacity is to turn it into artifice; to delight in knowledge is to turn it into fault-finding. How can the world then preserve the natural state of its life?\n\nThese eight may exist or not—either way, the world will not preserve the natural state of its life. But when these eight are present, they begin to entangle and ensnare the world in chaos. \"Aid\" means to assist, which is not natural. Ritual involves ornamentation, hence it becomes a craft; sagacity involves many skills, hence it becomes artifice; knowledge involves scrutinizing others’ faults, hence it is called fault-finding. \"Entangle\" describes a coiled, constricted state; \"ensnare\" suggests a flurry of meddling. Yet the world venerates and cherishes these things—how profoundly mistaken it is!\n\nIs it merely a matter of passing them by? No, people purify themselves to discuss them, kneel to present them, and drum and sing to dance for them. What am I to make of such things? \"Kneeling to present them\" echoes Laozi’s \"sitting to advance\"—what am I to make of such people?\n\nThus, when the noble person is compelled to oversee the world, nothing is better than non-action. Only through non-action can the natural state of life be preserved. Therefore, one who risks their life for the world may be entrusted with it; one who cherishes their life for the world may be charged with it. But one who values and cherishes their life more than governing the world is truly fit to be entrusted with it.\n\nThus, if the noble person can refrain from loosening their five viscera or flaunting their intelligence, abiding like a corpse yet manifesting like a dragon, silent as an abyss yet thundering like a storm, moving with spirit so that Heaven follows, and acting with ease so that the myriad things rise and flourish—then why would I presume to govern the world? \"Loosening\" and \"flaunting\" both harm the self. \"Abiding like a corpse\" means sitting motionless; \"manifesting like a dragon\" means transforming like a dragon. \"Silent as an abyss yet thundering like a storm\" describes stillness that contains movement, not mere lifelessness. \"The myriad things rise and flourish\" means all things are nurtured within one’s generative power, like steam accumulating to cook food.\n\nCui Qu asked Lao Dan: \"If one does not govern the world, how can the human heart be settled?\" Lao Dan replied: \"Be cautious—do not agitate the human heart. The human heart presses downward yet surges upward, rising and falling like a prisoner. It is pliant yet strong, sharp yet carved, scorching like fire, freezing like ice. In the blink of an eye, it can reach beyond the four seas. At rest, it is deep and still; in motion, it soars to Heaven. Proud and untamable, is it not the human heart alone?\n\nThis describes the human heart in extremes: when pressed, it shrinks and retreats; when spurred, it leaps and ascends. When pressed downward, though momentarily subdued like a prisoner, its indignation remains. When urged upward, if left unchecked, its fury can kill.\n\nSoft yet able to be firm—this is the heart’s pliancy yielding to strength. Sharp yet carved and polished—this is the heart’s hardness made supple. All these characters refer to the heart. *Ji* means swift; *fu* means to traverse. *Qi* means movement. \"Suspended to Heaven\" describes the heart in motion, as if hung from the sky. *Fènjiāo* is an unstoppable force.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to agitate the human heart. Yao and Shun, in their devotion, wore their thighs smooth of down and their shins bare of hair, exhausting their bodies to nurture the world. They fretted over their five viscera to enact benevolence and righteousness, strained their blood and *qi* to establish laws and measures—yet still, they could not prevail. Yao banished Huan Dou to Mount Chong, executed the Three Miao at Sanwei, and exiled Gong Gong to Youdu—this was his failure to master the world. By the time of the Three Kings, the world was thrown into great turmoil. Below, there were Jie and Robber Zhi; above, Zeng and Shi; and the Confucians and Mohists all arose. Thus, joy and anger bred suspicion, the foolish and the wise deceived one another, the good and the bad reviled each other, and truth and falsehood mocked one another—so the world declined. Great virtue diverged, and human nature and destiny dissolved into chaos. The world prized cunning, and the people exhausted themselves. Then came axes and saws, inked cords and chisels, to carve and shape them. The world was bound in fetters, trembling with fear, tiptoeing as if shackled. The great disorder lay in agitating the human heart. Thus, the worthy hid in the caves of great mountains, while the lords of ten thousand chariots trembled in their ancestral halls.\n\nIn this age, the executed lie piled upon one another, the imprisoned press shoulder to shoulder, and the punished stretch as far as the eye can see—yet the Confucians and Mohists still stretch their toes and wave their arms in the midst of fetters. *Líqì* means standing on tiptoe; *rǎngbì* means raising one’s arms to argue—both hands and feet in motion. Alas! How shameless they are, yet feel no shame! I do not know whether the wisdom of sages does not become the interlocking beams of a prison frame, or whether benevolence and righteousness do not become the shackles and chisels of a mortise. How do we know that Zeng and Shi are not the arrows of Jie and Robber Zhi? Arrows and bows are tools for harm—this means Zeng and Shi are but instruments for Jie and Robber Zhi. Therefore it is said: \"Abandon sagacity, discard knowledge, and the world will be greatly ordered.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor ruled as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, his commands obeyed throughout the world. Hearing that Master Guangcheng dwelt on Mount Kongtong—*Erya* says: \"North of the Dipper’s handle lies Kongtong Mountain\"; another account places it thirty *li* east of Yucheng in Liang—he went to see him, saying: \"I have heard that you have attained the perfection of the supreme Dao. I venture to ask: what is the essence of the supreme Dao? I wish to gather the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to govern *yin* and *yang* to bring life to all beings. How may this be done?\"\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: \"What you ask about is the substance of things; what you wish to govern is the remnant of things. What you inquire of is the fundamental essence of the Dao in things, while what you seek to control—*yin* and *yang*—is but their scattered residue. Since you began to govern the world, clouds gather before they amass into rain, plants wither before they yellow, and the light of the sun and moon grows dim. As for the petty minds of flatterers—how could they be worthy of discussing the supreme Dao?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white grass, and lived in seclusion for three months. Then he returned to seek the master again. Master Guangcheng lay with his head to the south. The Yellow Emperor approached from downwind, crawling on his knees, bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and asked: \"I have heard that you have attained the perfection of the supreme Dao. I venture to ask: how may one cultivate the body to attain longevity?\"\n\nMaster Guangcheng rose with a frown and said: \"Excellent question!\"\n\n\"Come, let me tell you of the supreme Dao.\n\nThe essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure;\nits ultimate state is dim and silent.\nSee nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness—\nthe body will then right itself.\nBe still, be pure; do not weary your form,\ndo not disturb your essence,\nand you may attain long life.\nLet the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing,\nthe heart know nothing—\nyour spirit will guard the body,\nand the body will endure.\nGuard your inner self, shut out the outer;\nexcessive knowledge brings ruin.\n\nI have guided you to the great brightness above,\nto the source of utmost yang;\nI have led you through the gate of profound obscurity,\nto the source of utmost yin.\n*Suì* means to proceed and reach one’s destination.\nThe sources of yin and yang are the primordial Great Ultimate.\n\nHeaven and earth have their offices,\nyin and yang have their treasuries.\nGuard your body with care,\nand all things will flourish of themselves.\n*Offices* are like government bureaus;\n*treasuries* are like storehouses.\n*Things* are what fill the bureaus and storehouses.\n\nI preserve the One and dwell in harmony.\nThus have I cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years,\nyet my form has never declined.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and said:\n\"Master Guangcheng, you are what may be called heaven!\"\n\nMaster Guangcheng said: \"Come.\nLet me tell you this:\nthose things are inexhaustible,\nyet people all take them for finite;\nthose things are unfathomable,\nyet people all take them for bounded.\nThose who attain my Dao\nrise above as emperors and below as kings;\nthose who lose my Dao\nsee light above but become earth below.\nIn life, they behold the light of sun and moon;\nin death, they return to earth.\nNow, the hundred flourishing things all arise from earth\nand return to earth.\n*The hundred flourishing things* refers to all that thrives.\n\nTherefore, I shall leave you\nand enter the gate of the boundless,\nto advance into the wilderness of the infinite.\nI shall share the radiance of the sun and moon,\nI shall endure with heaven and earth.\nWhen near me—ah, how inseparable!\nWhen far from me—ah, how obscure!\nWill all others perish,\nwhile I alone endure?\n*Mín* means the joining of threads;\n*hūn* means profound darkness.\n*When near me* refers to the realm one approaches—\nthe gate of the boundless, the wilderness of the infinite.\n*When far from me* refers to the world one leaves—\nthat is, departing from you.\nFrom now on, I fear that the immortal realm near me\nwill be as inseparable as joined threads,\nwhile the mundane world far from me\nwill fade into profound obscurity, never to be seen again!\nWill all those who have not attained the Dao perish,\nwhile I alone endure?\nThe three *hū* express sorrow for the world\nand lament the extinction of the Dao.\"\n\nCloud General was traveling east,\npassing the branch of the *fúyáo* tree—\nthe *fúyáo* is a divine tree growing in the Eastern Sea—\nwhen he happened upon Hong Meng.\nHong Meng, the primal qi of nature,\nwas slapping his thighs and leaping about in play.\nWhen Cloud General saw him, he halted in startled confusion,\nstood in solemn stillness, and asked:\n\"Venerable one, who are you?\nWhat are you doing here?\"\n\nHong Meng continued slapping his thighs and leaping without cease, then replied to Cloud General: \"Wandering.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"I wish to ask you something.\"\n\nHong Meng looked up at Cloud General and sighed: \"Ah.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"Heaven’s qi is disharmonious, earth’s qi is pent up, the six qi are unbalanced, and the four seasons are out of order. Now I wish to absorb the essence of the six qi to nurture all living things—how should I proceed?\"\n\nHong Meng slapped his thighs, leapt, and shook his head, saying: \"I do not know. I do not know.\"\n\nCloud General was thus unable to ask his question.\n\nAfter another three years, traveling east again, he passed through the wilds of Song and once more encountered Hong Meng. Cloud General rejoiced greatly, hastening forward to say: \"Has Heaven forgotten me? Has Heaven forgotten me?\" He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and entreated Hong Meng for instruction.\n\nHong Meng said: \"Drifting without aim, seeking nothing; reckless, knowing not where to go. The wanderer moves with restless steps, observing what is uncontrived. What do I know?\"\n\nCloud General said: \"I too thought myself reckless, yet the people follow wherever I go. I cannot be free of them, and now they imitate me. I wish to hear but a single word from you.\"\n\nHong Meng said: \"To disrupt the warp of Heaven, to defy the nature of things—this thwarts the mysterious workings of Heaven. Beasts scatter from their herds, and birds cry out in the night; calamity befalls the grasses and trees, disaster strikes even the insects. Alas! This is the fault of those who govern men.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"Then what am I to do?\"\nHong Meng said: \"Alas! How poisonous! Float away, return. Alas, how poisonous! I sigh for those who govern the world and leave behind such harm. Float away, return—Hong Meng wishes to depart in flight.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"I have encountered a heavenly trial. I beg to hear but a single word.\"\nHong Meng said: \"Alas! Cultivate the heart. Not 'nourish the heart' but 'heart-cultivation,' for the heart is cultivated through non-action. You need only abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. Cast off your form and body, expel your cleverness and wisdom, forget all categories and things. All categories—everything—must be forgotten with things. Merge into the vast primordial, unbind the heart and release the spirit, become vacant and without soul. The ten thousand things swirl in clouds, each returning to its root, each returning to its root yet unaware. This is what is meant by 'each thing possessing its own Supreme Polarity.' The 'swirling clouds' cannot be exhausted in a single word. In utter chaos, in primordial confusion, one passes one’s whole life without separation. If one claims to know it, one has already departed from it. It resides within the body, never once separated—only people cannot know it themselves. If one could know it, then it would be something external that could be left behind. Do not inquire into its name, for it has no name. Do not pry into its nature, for it has no nature. Things thus arise of themselves. This is what is meant by 'male and female unite their essence, and the ten thousand things are transformed and born.'\"\n\nCloud General said: \"Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me and shown me silence. Seeking it within myself, only now have I attained it. This is not found outside the self—turning inward to seek it, one finds it. This is what Laozi and Zhuangzi relied upon when they viewed heaven and earth, the chaff of human affairs, with such distant gaze. Yet those who inherit their teachings today merely engage in empty talk and sophistry, never grasping the reality.\"\n\nHe bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, rose, took his leave, and departed.\n\nThe common people all delight when others are like themselves and detest when others differ from themselves. Those who desire likeness and reject difference do so with the aim of standing out from the crowd. Yet those who aim to stand out from the crowd—have they ever truly stood out? Relying on the crowd to secure what they have heard, they are no better than the many. If someone differs from them, it is only because that person refuses to submit. Thus, they delight in those who are like themselves and detest those who differ, wishing all to submit and thereby surpass the crowd. Yet those who aim to stand out from the crowd—have they ever truly stood out? Only when all agree with them and no dissenting voices remain do their ears find peace. In this way, what they can do is far less than what the many can do. How have they ever stood out from the crowd?\n\nThose who would rule others’ states grasp at the advantages of the Three Kings while blind to the perils. This is to gamble with others’ states. How many gambles do not end in the ruin of others’ states? The chance of preserving another’s state is less than one in ten thousand, while the chance of ruining it is more than ten thousand to one if even a single misstep is made. How lamentable that those who possess lands do not understand this.\n\nTo speak of governing a state is to speak of standing out from the crowd. Those who possess lands possess a great thing. Possessing a great thing, one cannot be possessed by things. Only by not being possessed by things can one master things. Understanding that those who master things are not things themselves—how could this apply only to governing the world’s people? Moving in and out of the Six Directions, roaming the Nine Provinces, coming and going alone—this is called \"possessing alone.\" Those who possess alone are called \"most noble.\"\n\nA great thing is simply one great thing. \"Mastering things\" means dividing them by their kinds. \"Not being possessed by things\" means not being enslaved by things. The world is one undivided great whole—how can it be split into separate things? Only those who are not enslaved by things can govern its myriad details without being disturbed by their profusion. Thus it is said: \"Not being possessed by things, one can master things.\" Realizing that those who master things are not things themselves—how could this apply only to governing the world without the trouble of trivialities? Those who attain the Way alone are most noble and thus able to stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe teaching of the great person is like a shadow following form, an echo answering sound. When questioned, they respond, exhausting what is in their heart, matching heaven’s measure. Abiding where there is no echo, moving where there is no direction, they lead you to wander and return, stirring and roaming without end. \"Wander and return\"—to go and come back. Leading you to go and return, the restless people roam without end. Moving in and out without sides, with the sun without beginning, they praise and discuss the body, merging into great unity without self. Without self, how could there be anything seen? Those who see are the noble ones of old; those who see nothing are friends of heaven and earth.\n\nThat which is lowly yet cannot be shunned is things. That which is humble yet cannot be ignored is the people. That which is hidden yet cannot be avoided is affairs. That which is coarse yet cannot be omitted is laws. That which is distant yet cannot be abandoned is righteousness. That which is close yet cannot be narrowed is benevolence. That which is measured yet cannot be unaccumulated is ritual. That which is centered yet cannot be unexalted is virtue. That which is one yet cannot be unchanging is the Way. That which extends yet cannot be unenacted is heaven.\n\nThus the sage observes heaven yet does not assist, completes virtue yet is not burdened, emerges from the Way yet does not scheme, meets benevolence yet does not rely on it, approaches righteousness yet does not accumulate it, responds to ritual yet does not conceal, engages with affairs yet does not refuse, equalizes laws yet does not disorder, relies on the people yet does not belittle them, follows things yet does not abandon them. Things are not worth acting upon, yet they cannot be left unacted upon.\n\nThose who do not understand heaven are not pure in virtue. Those who do not comprehend the Way have no ground to stand upon. Those who do not understand the Way—how lamentable!\n\nWhat is the Dao? There is the Dao of heaven and the Dao of man. That which is revered through non-action is the Dao of heaven; that which is burdened through action is the Dao of man. The ruler embodies the Dao of heaven; the minister embodies the Dao of man. The distance between the Dao of heaven and the Dao of man is vast—this cannot but be examined.\n\nThis chapter’s meaning is shallow. If one’s words falter, they will surely be like a dog’s tail appended to sable fur.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve of the *Xunben* Edition of the *True Classic of Southern Florescence* concludes here.**\n*(Variant notes: #1 The received text reads ‘昔’ for ‘者’. #2#3 The received text reads ‘卓’ for ‘早’. #4 The received text reads ‘山’ for ‘上’.)*\n\n**Chapter Thirteen of the *Xunben* Edition of the *True Classic of Southern Florescence***\n*Recorded by Lu Lingzhufeng’s Luo Miandao, punctuated by his disciple Peng Xiang*\n\n**Outer Chapters: Heaven and Earth**\n\nThough heaven and earth are vast, their transformations are uniform; though the myriad things are numerous, their governance is one; though the people are many, their lord is singular. The lord originates in virtue and is completed by heaven. Thus it is said: The ancient rulers of the world practiced non-action—nothing more than the virtue of heaven.\n\nViewing words through the Dao, the lords of the world are rectified; viewing distinctions through the Dao, the righteousness of lord and minister is clarified; viewing abilities through the Dao, the offices of the world are well-ordered; viewing broadly through the Dao, the responses of the myriad things are complete.\n\nThus, that which pervades heaven and earth is virtue; that which courses through the myriad things is the Dao; that which governs people is affairs; that which possesses skill is technique. Technique is encompassed by affairs, affairs by righteousness, righteousness by virtue, virtue by the Dao, and the Dao by heaven. Thus it is said: Those of old who nurtured the world had no desires, yet the world was sufficient; practiced non-action, yet the myriad things were transformed; were profound and still, yet the hundred clans were settled.\n\nThe *Record* states: \"Comprehending the One, all affairs are complete; without intent, one attains it, and even ghosts and spirits submit.\"\n\nThe Master said: *(Note: These two instances of \"the Master said\" are treated as separate chapters in the Cui edition, but when connected to the preceding text, they serve as corroborating quotations. If detached, they lack coherence. It is suspected that \"the Master\" here refers to Laozi. The preceding quotation from the *Record* is also Laozi’s, so this continues his words. Otherwise, it would be one whom Zhuangzi revered. The later passage where \"the Master asked Lao Dan\" clearly refers to Confucius.)*\n\nThe Dao—it covers and bears the myriad things, vast and boundless! The noble person cannot but hollow out their heart. *(Hollow out the heart of its emotions and desires. The following text elaborates Zhuangzi’s exposition.)*\n\nNon-action as action is called heaven; non-action in speech is called virtue; loving people and benefiting things is called benevolence; unifying differences is called greatness; acting without eccentricity is called magnanimity; possessing myriad distinctions is called wealth.\n\nThus, holding to virtue is called discipline; the completion of virtue is called establishment; following the Dao is called fulfillment; not allowing things to wear down the will is called perfection. When the noble person is enlightened regarding these ten, they conceal their affairs in profound obscurity.\n\nThe greatness of the heart—how it surges forth, becoming the passage for the myriad things! Affairs are stored, yet the heart is not cramped; things depart, yet the heart does not linger.\n\nThose who are thus store gold in the mountains and pearls in the abyss; they do not prize wealth or draw near to nobility and riches; they do not delight in long life nor grieve over early death; they are not honored by success nor shamed by poverty. They do not confine the world’s benefits to their private share, nor do they take ruling the world as their own exalted position. *(Exalted, yet their fundamental heart remains luminous as ever.)* All things are one storehouse; death and life share the same form.\n\nThe Master said: The Dao—profound is its abode, limpid is its clarity! Even metal and stone cannot remain silent. *(Metal and stone have voices, but without striking, they do not sound.)* Who among the myriad things can determine it?\n\n*(Abode means stillness. 漻 (liú) describes the appearance of clear water. The fundamental nature of the Dao is like water, profound in its stillness, thus limpid in its clarity. It is also like metal and stone, which inherently possess their qualities—when struck, they resound. Extending this to water and metal, the principles of the myriad things are no different, yet people cannot discern and determine them.)*\n\nThose of kingly virtue move plainly yet are ashamed to be entangled in affairs; they establish their root and origin, and their knowledge communicates with the divine. Thus their virtue is vast. *(Kingly virtue: their virtue suffices to rule the world. Plainly moving: as in the common saying, \"plainly treading forward.\" Those of kingly virtue maintain a tranquil heart and regard entanglement in affairs as shameful. Yet by establishing their root and grasping the essential Dao, their wisdom naturally communicates with the divine, so their virtue is vast and suffices to rule the world.)*\n\nWhen their heart emerges, things adorn it. Thus, form does not arise without the Dao; life does not become luminous without virtue. Preserving form and exhausting life, establishing virtue and illuminating the Dao—is this not the mark of one of kingly virtue?\n\nVast and boundless! Suddenly emerging, suddenly moving, and the myriad things follow—this is what is called one of kingly virtue! *(This further elaborates from the perspective of the human heart. When the heart emerges, things adorn it—this is what is meant by \"human beings are tranquil at birth, this is the nature of heaven; stirred by things, they move, this is the desire of their nature.\" Our Confucians explain it plainly; Zhuangzi speaks with biting directness. Form does not arise without the Dao; life does not become luminous without virtue—Laozi and Zhuangzi’s conception of the Dao and virtue cannot be interpreted through our Confucian lens. 荡荡 (dàngdàng) describes a vastness that cannot be commanded. Only when one suddenly emerges and suddenly moves, with the myriad things following, does one truly embody kingly virtue.)*\n\nGazing into the obscure, listening to the soundless. Within obscurity, alone they see clarity; within silence, alone they hear harmony. *(Further, they are profound yet able to grasp things; divine yet able to be precise.)* Thus, in their interaction with the myriad things, they are utterly without substance yet supply what is sought; they roam freely and seize the essential, whether great or small, long or short, near or far.\n\nFrom *\"Gazing into the obscure\"* onward speaks of the marvels of the Way. In their interaction with the myriad things, its responses are inexhaustibly transformative—utterly empty, devoid of any fixed form, yet able to supply all that is sought. At times, it roams freely, yet always finds its place of return. Now vast, it suddenly becomes small; now long, it suddenly turns short; now short, it suddenly extends far. Such is the one who embodies kingly virtue.\n\n*(I suspect the preceding passage is an interpolated forgery, for it contains two instances of \"the Master said,\" and the depth and shallowness of its meaning stand out starkly. It should be excised.)*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Water and ascended the heights of Mount Kunlun, gazing southward. Upon his return, he lost his Dark Pearl. He sent Wisdom to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Li Zhu to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Chi Gou to seek it, but it was not found. Only when he sent Xiang Wang was it recovered.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor exclaimed: *\"How extraordinary! Could it be that only Xiang Wang could retrieve it?\"*\n\n*(All this is allegory. The Dark Pearl is the Dao. \"Wisdom\" refers to the cunning; Li Zhu, also known as Li Lou, is the keen-sighted. Chi Gou represents those reviled as incompetent—opposites of the cunning. Xiang Wang, \"Formless,\" is the opposite of the keen-sighted. The passage means that neither cleverness nor sharp vision suffices to grasp the Dao. Even the dull and shameless come close, yet still fall short; only by transcending all form can it be attained.)*\n\nYao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi.\n\nYao asked Xu You: *\"Could Nie Que be fit to match Heaven and become the Son of Heaven? I would rely on Wang Ni to assess him.\"*\n\nXu You replied: *\"How perilous! The world would be in ruins. Nie Que’s nature is keen, wise, and swift—his abilities surpass others, and he even takes human governance as if it were Heaven’s mandate. With such innate gifts, if he were to receive the throne, his excesses would only grow. He scrutinizes prohibitions against transgression yet does not understand how transgressions arise. Could he match Heaven? He would ride roughshod over others, forgetting Heaven. If he matched Heaven, he would trample over people while remaining oblivious to Heaven itself. He would take one body and multiply it into countless forms; he would exalt cunning, his mind racing like fire; he would be driven by trivial affairs, bound by things, ever glancing about to meet their demands, adapting to every circumstance, yet never abiding in constancy. How could such a one match Heaven?\"*\n\n*(Nevertheless, though Nie Que is as described, one cannot generalize about people. Just as there are clans and ancestors—clans have their elders, and ancestors are revered above all—Nie Que might serve as a father to many clans, but not as the father of fathers. That is the role of the ancestor.)*\n\n*\"Order is the harbinger of chaos; facing north is the prelude to disaster; facing south is the seed of tyranny. Nie Que’s talents might make him a leader in a disordered age, yet he would not escape the calamity of serving as a minister below or the treachery of ruling as a sovereign above—like a capable minister in a well-ordered age who becomes a villain in times of chaos.\"*\n\nYao observed the land of Hua, where a border guard said: *\"Ah! A sage!\"* He offered blessings, wishing the sage long life.\n\nYao declined.\n\nThe guard wished him wealth.\n\nYao declined.\n\nThe guard wished him many sons.\n\nYao declined.\n\nThe guard said: *\"Longevity, wealth, and many sons—these are what all people desire. Why do you alone refuse them?\"*\n\nYao replied: *\"Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many affairs; longevity brings many humiliations. These three do not nurture virtue, so I decline.\"*\n\nThe guard said: *\"At first, I took you for a sage, but now you are merely a gentleman. Heaven gives life to the people and assigns them duties. If you have many sons and assign them duties, what fear remains? If you are wealthy and distribute it, what affairs remain? The sage dwells like a quail and eats like a fledgling—unseen as a bird in flight. When the world is ordered, all things flourish together; when it is disordered, one cultivates virtue in seclusion. After a thousand years, weary of the world, one ascends as an immortal, riding the white clouds to the realm of the Emperor. With the three calamities averted and the body free from harm, what humiliation remains?\"*\n\nThe guard departed, but Yao followed and asked: *\"May I inquire further?\"*\n\nThe guard said: *\"Withdraw.\"*\n\nWhen Yao ruled the world, Bo Cheng Zi Gao was enfeoffed as a lord. When Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to Yu, Bo Cheng Zi Gao resigned his lordship to till the fields. Yu went to see him and found him plowing in the wilds. Yu hastened to stand downwind and asked: *\"In the past, when Yao ruled the world, you served as a lord. When Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to me, you resigned your lordship to plow. May I ask why?\"*\n\nBo Cheng Zi Gao replied: *\"In Yao’s time, there were no rewards, yet the people were encouraged; no punishments, yet the people stood in awe. Now you rely on rewards and punishments, yet the people grow ever less humane. Virtue has declined from this point; punishments have been established from this point. The chaos of later ages begins here.\"*\n\nThe Master said: \"Why not fully align with the Way and let it flow freely? Do not obstruct my affairs.\"\n\nPlowing diligently without pause—this is still abandonment. In the Great Beginning, there was Nonbeing; there was no Being, no name. From the One, all things arose, yet the One itself remained formless. That by which things are born is called *virtue*; before form emerged, all principles were already present, their order latent yet unbroken—this is called *ming* (fate). Stillness in motion gives rise to things; when things attain their inherent principles, this is called *form*. When form and body preserve spirit, each possessing its own pattern, this is called *nature*. Cultivating nature returns one to *virtue*; when *virtue* reaches its utmost, it merges with the primordial. This merging is emptiness; emptiness is vastness. The clamor of beaks falls silent; when beaks fall silent, they unite with Heaven and Earth. This union is seamless, like threads woven together—appearing foolish, appearing dull. This is called *mysterious virtue*, alignment with the *Great Compliance*.\n\nIf one asks whether the Great Beginning held Being or Nonbeing, the answer is: there was no Being, nor even this name. Yet within Nonbeing, the One arose—present, though not yet manifest. This is what is meant by \"the Limitless that is the Great Ultimate.\" All things receive this to be born—this is called *virtue*. Before form emerged, all principles were complete, each with its own order, though still undifferentiated—this is called *ming* (fate). When stillness moves, things are born. Each thing attains its inherent principles—this is called *form*. When form and body preserve the primordial spirit, each possessing its own pattern, this is called *nature*—what is meant by \"each thing containing a Great Ultimate.\" Cultivating nature returns one to *virtue*; when *virtue* reaches its peak, it merges with the formless beginning. This merging is emptiness; emptiness is boundlessness, beyond self and other. All the clamoring voices of the world become one. When beaks fall silent, they unite with Heaven and Earth. Seamless, like threads woven together—appearing foolish, appearing dull. *Mysterious virtue* is profound and wondrous; the *Great Compliance* ensures not a single being or thing is out of harmony.\n\nTradition holds that the Diagram of the Great Ultimate originated with recluses—this may well be so.\n\nConfucius asked Lao Dan: \"There is a man who practices the Way as if imitating it—affirming what others deny, denying what others affirm. A debater once said: 'Disjoin hardness and whiteness as if suspending them in the sky.' If this is so, can such a man be called a sage?\"\n\nLao Dan replied: \"This is but a clerk’s skill, a craftsman’s toil—wearying the body, startling the mind. The hound trained to catch raccoons ends up exhausted; the monkey’s agility lures it from the mountains. I tell you what you cannot hear and speak of what you cannot express: those with heads and tails but no heart or ears are legion; those with form and those without form or shape—all are ultimately nonexistent. Their movements and stillness, their life and death, their rise and fall—these are not their true essence. There is a Way of governance in man: forget things, forget Heaven, and it is called 'forgetting the self.' The one who forgets the self is said to enter Heaven.\"\n\n\"The Way of governance\" refers to the Way one governs, as if imitating or dissecting it. \"Suspended\" means displayed; \"sky\" means the universe—visible as if hung in the open. The passage from \"a clerk’s skill\" to \"from the mountains\" has been explained earlier. \"Heads and tails\" means having beginnings and ends. \"No heart\" means no heart to listen; \"no ears\" means not hearing.\n\nConfucius asked Lao Dan: \"There is a man whose Way of dwelling resembles that of a sage—affirming what others deny, denying what others affirm. A skilled debater once said: 'Separate hardness and whiteness as if displaying them in the sky, clearly visible.' If this man is like that, can he be called a sage?\"\n\nLao Dan replied: \"How could such a one be a sage? Let me tell you what you cannot hear and what you cannot speak of: among what people hear, some remember things with beginnings and ends, some listen without heart, as if without ears. Among what they say, some describe many things with form, some speak of the formless and shapeless as if present before them—yet all of this is ultimately unreal, mere emptiness. Their discussions of movement and stillness, life and death, rise and fall are but deceptive words, not the true principle of how things are. Debate is so useless. There is another Way of governance in man: he forgets things, forgets Heaven. Heaven is the source of things; to forget both is to forget utterly. The world calls those who forget much 'self-forgetters.' Thus, this man is called one who forgets the self. The one who forgets the self is said to enter Heaven—meaning he becomes one with Heaven. The line 'There is a Way of governance in man' responds to the earlier 'a man who practices the Way as if imitating it,' making the meaning clear.\"\n\nJiang Lü Mian went to see Ji Che and said: \"The Lord of Lu told me: 'I request your instruction.' I declined but was not permitted. Having already advised him, I do not know if it was fitting. Allow me to present it to you. I told the Lord of Lu: 'You must practice reverence and frugality, promote those who are publicly loyal without partiality—then who among the people would dare not be harmonious?'\"\n\nJi Che laughed heartily and said: \"If this is what you said, then compared to the virtue of emperors and kings, it is like a mantis raising its arms to block a chariot—it will surely fail. Moreover, if this is so, then he places himself in danger. His observation tower is crowded with things, and many will rush to follow his example.\"\n\nJiang Lü Mian started in alarm and said: \"I am bewildered by your words. Nevertheless, I wish to hear the drift of your teaching.\"\n\nJi Che said:\n\nWhen the Great Sage governs the world, he unsettles the people’s hearts, shaping them into teachings and transforming customs, eradicating their predatory impulses and fostering their solitary aspirations. It is as if their nature acts of itself, and the people know not how it comes to be. In this way, how could he be like a brother to Yao and Shun, who taught the people with deliberate methods? He desires unity in virtue, and the heart finds repose.\n\nTo dwell in lofty heights draws many to follow, and there is the peril of being unequal to the task. To unsettle the people’s hearts is to keep them from constraint. *Predatory impulses* are the inclinations to harm one another; *solitary aspirations* are the resolve of self-attainment. The phrase *\"how could he be like a brother to Yao and Shun\"* means that the Great Sage governs the world by letting things take their natural course, whereas Yao and Shun could not govern without leaving traces. Would the Great Sage deign to be a brother to Yao and Shun? *The heart finds repose* means the heart is at peace and still. When one shares virtue with the world without contrivance, the heart is at peace.\n\nZigong traveled south to Chu and, returning to Jin, passed by Hanyin. There he saw an old man preparing his garden beds, digging a tunnel to enter the well, and hoisting a jar to water the plants. He toiled laboriously, expending great effort for little result. Zigong said: \"Here is a device that can irrigate a hundred beds in a day, requiring little effort yet yielding great results. Would you not wish to use it?\" The gardener looked up and said: \"What do you mean?\"\n\nZigong said: \"Carve wood into a machine, with the rear heavy and the front light. Drawing water as if pulling, swift as boiling water overflowing—this is called a well-swing.\"\n\nThe gardener flushed with anger, his face darkening as he laughed: \"I have heard from my teacher that those who possess mechanical devices must engage in mechanical affairs, and those who engage in mechanical affairs must harbor a mechanical heart. When a mechanical heart lodges in the breast, purity and whiteness are incomplete—purity and whiteness being one’s original nature. If purity and whiteness are incomplete, the spirit’s vitality is unsettled. One whose spirit’s vitality is unsettled is not borne by the Dao. I do not fail to know of such things; I am ashamed to do them.\"\n\nZigong’s eyes dimmed with shame; he lowered his head and made no reply. After a while, the gardener said: \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I am a disciple of Confucius.\"\n\nThe gardener said: \"Are you not one of those who, with vast learning, presume to rival the sages, and with endless chatter, seek to overshadow the multitude? You strum a single string and sing mournful songs to peddle your reputation across the world! You are about to forget your spirit and qi, to ruin your body—how could you possibly govern yourself, let alone the world? Be on your way; do not hinder my work.\"\n\nZigong shrank back in dismay, his face pale. Overwhelmed with reverence, he felt ill at ease and walked thirty *li* before recovering. His disciples asked: \"Who was that man just now? Why did you change countenance and lose composure, remaining unsettled for the rest of the day?\"\n\nZigong replied: \"At first, I thought there was only one man in the world—meaning Confucius—but now I know there is another. I have heard the Master say: 'In affairs, seek what is fitting; in achievement, seek completion; expend little effort yet yield great results—this is the Way of the sage.' Yet now I see it is not so. One who holds to the Dao has virtue complete; with virtue complete, the body is whole; with the body whole, the spirit is whole. With the spirit whole, this is the Way of the sage. Entrusting one’s life to the people, moving among them without knowing one’s destination—how boundless, how perfectly pure! Entrusting my life to the people, moving among them without knowing where I go—this is merely to dwell in harmony with them, forgetting all else. How boundless, how perfectly whole! One must forget the heart that pursues profit, skill, and cunning. Such a person does not turn toward what is not his will, nor act on what is not his heart. Though the world praises him, if it aligns with his principles, he remains unmoved; though the world condemns him, if it contradicts his principles, he remains untroubled. The world’s praise or blame neither benefits nor harms him—this is what we call a person of complete virtue. I am but a man tossed by wind and waves.\"\n\nReturning to Lu, he reported this to Confucius. Confucius said: \"That man practices the arts of Hundun. Hundun refers to the Great Ultimate. He knows one thing but not two, cultivates his inner self but does not attend to externals. One who is clear and enters simplicity, who practices non-action and returns to uncarved simplicity, who embraces the spirit and wanders among the common people—were you truly startled? As for the arts of Hundun, how could you or I comprehend them?\"\n\nZhun Mang was traveling east to the Great Abyss when he encountered Yuan Feng on the shores of the Eastern Sea. Yuan Feng asked: \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To the Great Abyss.\"\n\n\"What will you do there?\"\n\n\"The Great Abyss, as a thing, receives all without filling, draws from without exhausting. I will wander there.\"\n\nYuan Feng said: \"Do you have no concern for the horizontal-eyed people? I wish to hear of sagely governance.\"\n\nZhun Mang said: \"Sagely governance? Let me speak of what it entails. Offices are established without error, talents are promoted without mistake, all circumstances are seen clearly and actions taken accordingly. One acts, and the world is transformed. With a wave of the hand or a glance, the people of the four directions all come—this is called sagely governance. Sagely governance means establishing offices and enacting policies without error, promoting talents without mistake, fully perceiving human affairs and acting accordingly. One acts with such care that no misstep is feared. I have said that when one cultivates oneself, the world is transformed. Once self-cultivation is achieved, a wave of the hand or a glance brings all people to follow.\"\n\n\"I wish to hear of the virtuous person.\"\n\nYuan Feng, hearing Zhun Mang’s words, found sagely governance not the ultimate. He asked again: \"I wish to hear of the virtuous person.\"\n\nZhun Mang said: \"The virtuous person dwells without thought, moves without calculation, harbors no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness. Within the four seas, all rejoice in shared benefit, all find peace in shared provision. He is tender as a child toward its mother, yet carefree as one who wanders and loses the Way. Wealth and resources abound, yet he does not know their source; food and drink suffice, yet he does not know their origin—this is the bearing of the virtuous person.\"\n\n\"I wish to hear of the spirit person.\"\n\nZhun Mang said: \"The supreme spirit rides the light, its form vanishing—this is called 'illuminating the vast.' After attaining the Dao, the spirit ascends and roams only in the realm of light. Looking down, its body is like withered wood or dung. This is called 'illuminating the vast,' meaning it shines through the boundless, no longer confined by form. When life is fully realized and emotions fully expressed, heaven and earth rejoice and all things dissolve. All things return to their true nature—this is called 'merging with the obscure.' To 'realize life fully' is to exhaust one’s destiny and express one’s emotions completely. As I have spoken of the spirit person’s state, so too one who exhausts the root of life and fully expresses emotions truly rejoices with heaven and earth, and all things vanish. All things return to their original nature, merging into the obscure and formless.\"\n\nMenwugui and Chizhang Manji observed the armies of King Wu. Chizhang Manji said: \"He does not measure up to the Yu clan.\"\n\nThus one avoids this calamity.\n\nMenwugui said: \"When the world is already well-governed, does it still require the Yu clan to govern it? Or does it wait until chaos arises before seeking order?\"\n\nChizhang Manji replied: \"That the world be well-governed is the very wish—why calculate whether it requires the Yu clan? If the world is well-governed, the wish is fulfilled; what need is there for the Yu clan? The Yu clan’s remedy for sores is like a bald man donning a wig or a sick man seeking a physician. A filial son, holding medicine to cure his compassionate father, wears a scorched expression—even the sage feels shame at this. King Wu’s armies certainly do not measure up to the Yu clan, yet even the Yu clan’s governance is no more than a physician using medicine to treat illness, not something arising from spontaneity.\n\nIn the age of utmost virtue, worthies are not exalted, abilities are not employed. The ruler is like the topmost branch—high above yet without intent, as the rulers of old were. The people are like wild deer: upright yet unaware of righteousness, loving yet unaware of benevolence, sincere yet unaware of loyalty, fitting yet unaware of trustworthiness, moving and employing one another without considering it a favor. Thus their actions leave no traces, their affairs no record.\n\nThe filial son does not flatter his parents, the loyal minister does not fawn upon his lord—this is the height of ministerial and filial excellence. When a parent’s words are affirmed and their conduct deemed good, the world calls the child unfilial; when a lord’s words are affirmed and their conduct deemed good, the world calls the minister disloyal. Yet how can one know this must be so? When the world’s so-called right is affirmed as right, and its so-called good is affirmed as good, it does not call such a one a flatterer. Is it then that the world’s standards are stricter toward kin and more reverent toward rulers?\n\nThe world deems loyal ministers and filial sons those who, when their lord or parent errs, admonish rather than flatter. Yet those who comply with and please their lord or parent are inevitably branded as flatterers, while those who comply with and please the world are not—thus one dares to admonish lord or parent but not the world. Are the world’s standards indeed stricter toward kin and more reverent toward rulers?\n\nWhen others call one a guide, one bristles with anger; when called a flatterer, one flushes with indignation. Yet all one’s life one guides others, all one’s life one flatters others—gathering crowds with polished words and elaborate similes, so that beginning and end, root and branch never align. People refuse the name of guide or flatterer, yet their conduct is nothing but lifelong flattery. They mix metaphors, embellish speech, and seek to assemble followers, yet never recognize their own actions—how can one’s own beginning and end, root and branch, not stand in mutual accusation?\n\nDraped in robes, adorned in colors, modulating one’s expression to ingratiate an age—yet never calling oneself a flatterer; joining others in debating right and wrong—yet never calling oneself one of the crowd: this is the height of folly.\n\nThis passage now turns to Shun: Shun draped his robes, and the world was governed; he displayed the five colors to adorn the five virtues, ruling with reverence from his southern-facing throne. Thus it is said: draped in robes, adorned in colors, modulating his expression. Shun thus pleased an entire age without calling himself a flatterer; he debated right and wrong with others without calling himself one of the crowd. This is the height of folly.\n\nThis speaks of Shun, yet the following text shifts to King Wu—seemingly a veiled critique, unnoticed by readers.\n\nOne who knows their own folly is not utterly foolish; one who knows their own confusion is not utterly confused.\"\n\nGreat confusion persists unsolved for a lifetime; great folly remains unenlightened to the end. Appending \"folly\" or adding \"confusion\" to a statement—such is the rhetorical style often seen in Zhuangzi’s writing.\n\nWhen three travel together and one is confused, the destination may still be reached, for confusion is but slight; if two are confused, effort is spent in vain, for confusion prevails. Now that the whole world is confused, though I have my own aspirations, they cannot be fulfilled. Is this not lamentable?\n\nThis uses the journey as a metaphor: if three set out together toward the east, but one wishes to go west, confusion is but partial, and the east may still be reached. If two wish to go west, confusion prevails, and all labor is wasted. The analogy refers to King Wu’s campaign against Zhou, when eight hundred states pledged allegiance—thus the whole world was confused. \"I\" here is Chi Zhang Manji speaking of himself. *Qi xiang* means \"desired direction.\" Though I have my own course, it cannot be realized—is this not lamentable? This deeply grieves the affair of King Wu.\n\nGrand music does not enter the ears of the village; when the vulgar tunes *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* are played, people cackle with delight. Thus lofty speech does not lodge in the hearts of the multitude; the profound is unspoken, and common speech prevails. If two earthen jars are struck as bells, confusion arises, and the true destination is lost.\n\nNow that the whole world is confused, though I have my aspirations, how can they be awaited? This again uses music as a metaphor: ancient music does not please the common ear, but vulgar tunes bring joy. If two strike earthen jars for sound, people delight in the novelty and are led astray. The music of antiquity cannot spread—how much less so when the whole world is confused! Though I have my own course, how can it be realized? The repeated metaphors and reiterated words make the meaning all the more poignant.\n\nOld commentaries, misled by the phrase \"the destination,\" read this as a continuation of the previous passage and emend *fou zhong* to *chui zhong*, which is mistaken. Here, \"the destination is lost\" echoes the earlier \"the destination may be reached.\" The former refers to a journey; this refers to the spread of music.\n\nTo know something is unattainable yet force it is yet another confusion. Therefore, it is best to let go and not pursue it. If not pursued, with whom should one share concern?\n\nThis subtly refers to those like Boyi: abandoning the matter and not examining it, one need not share others’ sorrows. Consider the leper who gives birth at midnight, hastily fetching a light to inspect the child, anxious lest it resemble himself. This illustrates one who need not share another’s concern: the leper fears his child will be like him, thus not wishing for sameness—so why share another’s sorrow?\n\nA hundred-year-old tree, split into sacrificial vessels, adorned with blue and yellow patterns, its offcuts discarded in the ditch—compared to the vessel, the ditch-bound scrap is base, yet both have lost their original nature. Robber Zhi and the virtuous Zeng and Shi differ in conduct, yet their loss of nature is the same.\n\nMoreover, there are five ways to lose one’s nature:\n1. The five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear;\n2. The five sounds confuse the ears, making them dull;\n3. The five odors choke the nose, causing the forehead to furrow;\n4. The five flavors cloy the mouth, making it numb;\n5. Desires and aversions agitate the heart, scattering the nature.\n\nThese five are all harms to life. Yet Yang Zhu and Mo Di, striving and self-satisfied, claim to have attained the Way—this is not what I call attainment. If distress can be called attainment, then the owl in a cage may also be said to have attained it.\n\nFurthermore, desires and aversions, sounds and colors, barricade the inner self; ceremonial caps, kingfisher plumes, sashes, and long girdles constrain the outer. Internally hemmed in by barriers, externally bound by cords, one glories in being entangled yet deems it attainment. If so, then prisoners with bound arms and fingers, or tigers and leopards in cages, may also be said to have attained it.\n\n*The True Classic of Southern Florescence* concludes here with Chapter Thirteen of the received text. Chapter Fourteen, \"The Dao of Heaven,\" follows in the Outer Chapters.\n\n*The True Classic of Southern Florescence*, following the received text, Chapter Fourteen: \"The Dao of Heaven\"\nRecorded by Lu Lingzhu of Bamboo Peak, Luling; collated by disciple Peng Xiang\n\nThe Dao of Heaven operates without accumulation, thus all things are completed;\nThe Dao of the Sovereign operates without accumulation, thus the world submits;\nThe Dao of the Sage operates without accumulation, thus all within the seas obeys.\nWithout accumulation, there is no stagnation.\n\nThose who are enlightened by Heaven, who penetrate the Sage, whose sixfold penetration and fourfold openness manifest the virtue of emperors and kings—when they act for themselves, they are obscurely quiescent, without exception.\nObscurely quiescent: all cleverness and brilliance are extinguished.\nSixfold penetration and fourfold openness: like the six directions and four quarters, all is thoroughly pervaded.\n\nThe stillness of the Sage is not because stillness is good, and thus he is still.\nHe does not take stillness as good and thereby impose it.\nNothing in the myriad things suffices to disturb his mind, thus he is still.\nWhen water is still, it clearly mirrors beard and brows, its level serves as a standard, and the great craftsman takes it as his model.\n*(The* Rites of Zhou*: \"The artisan levels the ground with water.\")*\nIf still water is so luminous, how much more so the spirit?\nIs the Sage’s mind still?\nIt is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the looking-glass of the myriad things.\n\nNow, emptiness, stillness, tranquility, quiescence, and non-action—these are the level of Heaven and Earth, the perfection of the Way and its power.\nThus emperors, kings, and sages rest therein.\nTo rest is to halt.\nAt rest, one is empty; empty, then full—fullness is order.\nWithin emptiness there is fullness, naturally possessing sequence.\nEmpty, then still; still, then moving; moving, then attaining.\nWithin stillness there is movement; moving, there is nothing it does not attain.\nStill, then non-action; in non-action, those who handle affairs bear their responsibility.\nIn non-action, those who manage affairs naturally assume their duty.\nIn non-action, one is carefree.\nCarefree: sorrow and calamity cannot abide, and one’s years and lifespan are long.\n\nNow, emptiness, stillness, tranquility, quiescence, and non-action—these are the root of the myriad things.\nIlluminating this and facing south, one becomes Yao as sovereign;\nIlluminating this and facing north, one becomes Shun as minister.\nPracticing this in the superior position, it is the virtue of emperors, kings, and the Son of Heaven;\nPracticing this in the inferior position, it is the Way of the obscure sage and the unadorned king.\nRetiring with this to dwell in leisure, wandering among rivers and seas, mountains and forests, scholars submit;\nAdvancing with this to govern the age, then achievements are great, fame is illustrious, and the world is unified.\n\nStill, one is a sage; moving, one is a king.\nIn non-action, one is revered; in simplicity and plainness, none in the world can rival their beauty.\n\nThose who comprehend the virtue of Heaven and Earth—this is called the great root and great origin, harmonizing with Heaven.\nThis is how one harmonizes and regulates the world, harmonizing with others.\nHarmonizing with others is called human joy;\nHarmonizing with Heaven is called Heavenly joy.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"My Master! My Master!\"—that is, the Great Master—\n\"Who carves the myriad things yet is not cruel;\nWhose beneficence extends to ten thousand generations yet is not benevolent;\nWho is older than high antiquity yet is not long-lived;\nWho covers and bears Heaven and Earth, who carves and adorns the forms of the multitude, yet is not skillful.\"\nThis is called Heavenly joy.\n\nThus it is said: One who knows Heavenly joy—\nIn life, they move with Heaven; in death, they transform with things.\nStill, they share the virtue of yin; moving, they share the wave of yang.\nThus, one who knows Heavenly joy has no resentment from Heaven, no blame from others, no encumbrance from things, no reproach from spirits.\n\nThus it is said:\nIn movement, they are Heaven; in stillness, they are Earth.\nWith a single mind settled, they rule the world.\nTheir spirits do not haunt; their souls do not weary.\nWith a single mind settled, the myriad things submit.\n\nSpeaking of emptiness and stillness, extending them to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things—this is called Heavenly joy.\nHeavenly joy is the Sage’s mind nurturing the world.\n\nNow, the virtue of emperors and kings takes Heaven and Earth as its model, the Way and its power as its master, and non-action as its constant.\nIn non-action, one employs the world and has surplus;\nIn action, one is employed by the world and is insufficient.\nThus the ancients prized non-action.\n\nWhen the superior practices non-action, the inferior also practices non-action—this is the inferior harmonizing in virtue with the superior.\nWhen the inferior harmonizes in virtue with the superior, they do not serve as ministers.\nWhen the inferior acts, the superior also acts—this is the superior harmonizing in the Way with the inferior.\nWhen the superior harmonizes in the Way with the inferior, they do not serve as lords.\nThe superior must practice non-action and employ the world; the inferior must act and be employed by the world.\nThis is the unchanging Way.\n\nThus the ancients who ruled the world—\nThough their knowledge encompassed Heaven and Earth, they did not scheme for themselves;\nThough their eloquence adorned the myriad things, they did not delight in themselves;\nThough their abilities exhausted the world within the seas, they did not act for themselves.\nHeaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform; Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured; emperors and kings practice non-action, yet the world achieves merit.\n\nThus it is said: None is more divine than Heaven, none richer than Earth, none greater than emperors and kings.\nThus it is said: The virtue of emperors and kings matches Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the Way of riding Heaven and Earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the multitudes of people.\n\nThe root lies above, the branches below;\nThe essential lies with the ruler, the details with the ministers.\nThe deployment of the three armies and the five weapons—this is the branch of virtue;\nRewards and punishments, advantages and harms, the application of the five punishments—this is the branch of teaching;\nRites, laws, measures, and standards; forms, names, comparisons, and details—this is the branch of governance;\nThe sounds of bells and drums, the adornments of feathers and plumes—this is the branch of music;\nWailing and weeping, mourning garments, degrees of severity in attire—this is the branch of mourning.\nThese five branches require the operation of spirit and the movement of the mind’s art before they can be followed.\n\nBranches and details—ancient people possessed them, but they are not what comes first.\nThe ruler leads, the minister follows; the father leads, the child follows; the elder brother leads, the younger brother follows; the elder leads, the younger follows; the man leads, the woman follows; the husband leads, the wife follows.\nNow, precedence in honor and rank, sequence in before and after—these are the movements of Heaven and Earth. Thus the Sage takes them as his model.\n\nHeaven is honored and Earth is humble—this is the proper station of the numinous;\nSpring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow—this is the sequence of the four seasons;\nThe transformations and creations of the myriad things, their sprouting forms and configurations, their waxing and waning, their flowing changes—\nEven Heaven and Earth, most numinous of all, possess this order of precedence and sequence, how much more so the Way of Man.\nIn ancestral temples, kinship is revered; in court, honor is revered; in village communities, seniority is revered; in affairs, worthiness is revered—this is the great order of the Dao.\nTo speak of the Dao while rejecting its order is not the Dao; to speak of the Dao while misrepresenting it is to grasp at nothing.\nThus the ancients who illuminated the great Dao first illuminated Heaven, then followed with virtue and power; once virtue and power were illuminated, benevolence and righteousness followed; once benevolence and righteousness were illuminated, the divisions of duty followed; once the divisions of duty were illuminated, forms and names followed; once forms and names were illuminated, the delegation of tasks followed; once the delegation of tasks was illuminated, investigation and examination followed (examination: pronounced *shěng*, meaning to trace origins and scrutinize forms);\nOnce investigation and examination were illuminated, right and wrong followed; once right and wrong were illuminated, rewards and punishments followed; once rewards and punishments were illuminated, the foolish and the wise were properly placed, the noble and the base occupied their stations, the benevolent and worthy, the unworthy and flawed, all accorded with their natures.\nAbilities were necessarily distinguished, names necessarily followed.\nWith this, one served superiors, nurtured subordinates, governed things, and cultivated the self; wisdom and schemes were not employed, for all necessarily returned to Heaven.\nThis is called Great Peace, the ultimate in governance.\nThus the text says: \"There are forms and names.\"\nForms and names—ancient people possessed them, but they are not what comes first.\nThose of old who spoke of the great Dao underwent five transformations before forms and names could be established, nine transformations before rewards and punishments could be discussed.\nFrom illuminating Heaven to establishing forms and names—five transformations; from illuminating Heaven to discussing rewards and punishments—nine transformations.\nTo abruptly speak of forms and names is to ignore their foundation; to abruptly speak of rewards and punishments is to ignore their beginning.\nTo speak of the Dao in reverse, to discourse on it while within it, is what men govern—how can they govern others?\nTo abruptly speak of forms, names, rewards, and punishments is to possess the tools of governance, not the Way of governance.\nSuch tools may be applied to the world, but they are insufficient to govern the world.\nThis is called a disputatious scholar, a man of partial understanding.\nRites, laws, measures, and degrees, the comparison and scrutiny of forms and names—ancient people possessed them.\nThese are how inferiors serve superiors, not how superiors nurture subiors.\n\nOf old, Shun asked Yao: \"How does the Son of Heaven employ his mind?\"\nYao said: \"I do not slight the bereft, I do not abandon the destitute, I grieve for the dead, I cherish the young and pity women—this is how I employ my mind.\"\nShun said: \"Admirable indeed, yet it is not great.\"\nYao said: \"Then what should it be?\"\nShun said: \"When the virtue of Heaven emerges in tranquility, the sun and moon shine and the four seasons proceed, like the constancy of day and night, like the movement of clouds and the falling of rain.\"\nYao said: \"Then I am but entangled and troubled!\" (Yao referred to himself.)\nYou, sir, align with Heaven; I align with men.\nNow Heaven and Earth are what the ancients deemed greatest, what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all praised.\nThus those of old who ruled all under Heaven—what did they do? They simply modeled themselves on Heaven and Earth.\nFor Heaven and Earth are what the ancients deemed greatest.\n\n(Here follows the passage from *Zhuangzi* where Confucius and Laozi converse:)\nConfucius was storing books in the Western Zhou archives when Zilu counseled: \"I have heard that the Keeper of the Archives in Zhou, a man named Lao Dan, has retired and lives at home. If you wish to store books, Master, why not seek his assistance?\"\nConfucius said: \"Very well.\"\nHe went to see Laozi, who refused. Thereupon Confucius expounded the Twelve Classics to persuade him (one account says the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*—the Six Classics—plus the Six *Weft* texts, totaling twelve; another says the *Changes*’ upper and lower canons plus the Ten Wings make twelve; another says the twelve ducal reigns of the *Spring and Autumn*. The accounts differ, and need not be rigidly adhered to).\nLaozi interrupted his discourse, saying: \"This is too prolix! I would hear the essentials.\"\nConfucius said: \"The essentials lie in benevolence and righteousness.\"\nLaozi said: \"May I ask: are benevolence and righteousness part of human nature?\"\nConfucius said: \"Indeed. The noble man who lacks benevolence cannot be perfected; without righteousness, he cannot live. Benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of man—what more is there to be done?\"\nLaozi said: \"May I ask: what are benevolence and righteousness?\"\nConfucius said: \"A joyful heart in harmony with things, universal love without partiality—this is the essence of benevolence and righteousness.\"\nLaozi said: \"Hmm! Nearly the last word! (A remark on how such talk comes too late.)\nUniversal love—is this not impractical? Without partiality—is this not itself partiality? Sir, do you wish to ensure that the world does not lose its shepherds? Then Heaven and Earth already have their constancy, the sun and moon their brightness, the stars and constellations their ranks, birds and beasts their flocks, trees and plants their uprightness.\nYou, sir, should follow virtue in your conduct, proceed by guiding and leading—this is already perfection. Why then laboriously brandish benevolence and righteousness like one beating a drum to seek a lost child?\nAh! You, sir, confuse human nature!\"\nShi Chengqi saw Laozi and asked: \"I have heard that you, sir, are a sage. I did not hesitate to travel far to seek an audience, journeying a hundred stages with calloused feet, never daring to rest. Now I observe that you are no sage. You have leftover vegetables in rat burrows yet abandon your younger sister—this is not benevolent. Before you, food is not fully consumed, yet you hoard without limit.\" (Rat burrows contain leftover scraps, yet he cannot even nourish his sister; food is not exhausted before him, yet his hoarding knows no bounds—these are all unenlightened acts. The first sentence, \"not benevolent,\" encompasses the following criticisms of abandoning his sister and hoarding, a rebuke based on worldly views, not an actual occurrence.)\n\nLaozi remained silent, offering no response. The next day, Shi Chengqi sought him again and said: \"Yesterday, I reproached you, but now my heart has truly retreated. *Retreated*—meaning withdrawn, no longer reproaching or criticizing. Why is this?\" Laozi replied: \"The man of cunning wisdom and divine sagacity—I once believed myself free of such traits. *Free*—meaning departed. In the past, when you called me an ox, you named me an ox; when you called me a horse, you named me a horse. If one truly possesses the reality, yet refuses the name others give, one invites calamity anew. I submit—always submit. I do not submit because submission is due. *Submit*—meaning to yield. My submission to others is but the constant presence of a yielding heart, not merely yielding to what is worthy of submission. Even when words are unworthy, I yield.\"\n\nShi Chengqi stepped aside like a wild goose avoiding its shadow, then advanced and asked how to cultivate the self. Laozi said: \"Your countenance is haughty, your gaze piercing, your brow broad and towering, your mouth gaping wide, your demeanor rigid. You are like a horse reined in yet still straining to bolt. Though tethered, its mind ever races. To move is to restrain, to act is to trigger the crossbow’s mechanism. To observe is to scrutinize, to know is to perceive excess. All this betrays a lack of trustworthiness. Such a man at the borderlands would be called a thief.\"\n\nLaozi continued: \"As for the Dao, it is not exhausted in greatness nor neglected in smallness, thus all things are complete within it. Vast—so boundless it contains all; profound—so unfathomable it cannot be measured. Forms, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are but the dregs of spirit. Who but the Perfected Man can stabilize them? The Perfected Man—though he possesses the world, how vast is this! Yet it does not burden him. Though the world seethes and struggles, he does not join it. He discerns the unreal and does not shift with profit. He exhausts the truth of things and guards their root. Thus, he transcends heaven and earth, forsakes the myriad things, and his spirit is never constrained. He penetrates the Dao, unites with virtue, sets aside benevolence and righteousness, and treats rites and music as guests—not as masters. The heart of the Perfected Man is thus settled.\"\n\nThis passage, in the manner of Laozi’s response to Shi Chengqi’s question:\n\nThe Dao prized by the world is but texts. Texts are merely words, and words have their value. What is valued in words is their meaning, and meaning has its source. Yet the source of meaning cannot be transmitted through words, though the world clings to transmitting words through texts. Though the world prizes them, they are not truly worthy—for what they prize is not what is truly prized. Thus, what can be seen are forms and colors; what can be heard are names and sounds. Alas! The world believes forms, colors, names, and sounds suffice to grasp the truth of things. Yet if forms, colors, names, and sounds truly do not suffice, then the wise do not speak, and those who speak are not wise. How, then, could the world recognize this?\n\nDuke Huan was reading in the hall when Wheelwright Bian, carving a wheel below, set down his mallet and chisel, ascended, and asked: \"May I dare ask what words Your Grace reads?\" The Duke replied: \"The words of a sage.\" The wheelwright said: \"Is the sage still alive?\"\n\nDuke Huan said: \"He is already dead.\"\nWheelwright Bian replied: \"Then what Your Grace reads is but the dregs and husks of the ancients.\"\n\nDuke Huan said: \"I read books—how dare a wheelwright pass judgment? If you have an explanation, speak; if not, you shall die.\"\nWheelwright Bian said: \"Your servant observes this through his own craft. When carving a wheel, if done too slowly, it is smooth but not firm; if done too swiftly, it is rough and does not fit. Neither too slow nor too swift—it is grasped by the hand and responds to the heart. The mouth cannot express it, yet a certain method resides therein. I cannot make my son understand it, nor can my son receive it from me. Thus, though I am seventy years old, I still carve wheels in my old age. The ancients and what they could not transmit are gone—then what Your Grace reads is but the dregs of the ancients.\"\n\n*The Fourteenth Scroll of the Xunben Edition of the Nan Hua True Scripture* concludes.\n*The Fifteenth Scroll of the Xunben Edition of the Nan Hua True Scripture*\nRecorded by Lu Lingzhufeng’s Luo Miandao, collated by his disciple Peng Xiang.\n\n**Outer Chapters: Heaven’s Revolutions**\nDoes Heaven revolve?\n\nDoes Earth abide in stillness?\nDo the sun and moon contend for their positions?\nThe sun and moon share the ecliptic—thus it is said they contend for their positions.\nWho governs this?\nWho upholds this order?\nIs it that some mechanism compels them, leaving them no choice?\nOr do they revolve of themselves, unable to halt?\nThat which has a mechanism is as if bound by something.\nThat which cannot halt of itself is as if unbound by anything.\nDo clouds form rain?\nOr does rain form clouds?\nWho bestows this abundance?\nWho, idle and indulgent in pleasure, urges forth these words—clouds as abundance, rain as bestowal?\nThe wind rises from the north, then turns west, then east, its sound rising in wandering ascent.\nWho exhales and inhales this?\nWho, idle and unoccupied, stirs and scatters it thus?\nThe wind rises from the north, then moves west and east, ascending in wandering flight.\nWhen it rises from the north, it naturally moves south—thus the south need not be named.\nWhen it ascends, it naturally rises from below—thus the below need not be spoken.\nMay I ask why?\nWu Xian Rao replied: Come, let me tell you.\n\nHeaven possesses the Six Ultimates and the Five Constants. If the emperor-kings align with them, there is order; if they oppose them, there is misfortune. The affairs of the Ninefold Luo bring governance to completion and virtue to fulfillment, overseeing the lands below, and all under heaven bear them—this is called the Supreme August. *Luo* is synonymous with *luo* (settlements), referring to the affairs of the nine provinces.\n\nThe Grand Steward Dang of Shang asked Zhuangzi about benevolence. Zhuangzi said: \"Tigers and wolves are benevolent.\" Dang asked: \"What do you mean?\" Zhuangzi replied: \"Father and son are affectionate—how is this not benevolence?\" Dang said: \"May I ask about perfect benevolence?\" Zhuangzi said: \"Perfect benevolence has no partiality.\" The Grand Steward said: \"I have heard that without partiality there is no love, and without love there is no filial piety. Can one say that perfect benevolence is unfilial?\" Zhuangzi said: \"Not so. Perfect benevolence is lofty indeed—filial piety is hardly sufficient to describe it. This is not a statement that surpasses filial piety, but one that falls short of it. This is what is meant by perfect benevolence having no partiality. That which surpasses is contrived; that which falls short is natural.\n\nConsider one traveling south to Ying: facing north, they do not see Mount Ming—why is this? It is because they are too far from it. *Mount Ming* is the name of a northern mountain. Just as one traveling far does not see Mount Ming, so too does perfect benevolence not see filial piety. Thus it is said: Reverent filial piety is easy; loving filial piety is difficult. Loving filial piety is easy; forgetting one’s kin is difficult. Forgetting one’s kin is easy; making one’s kin forget oneself is difficult. Making one’s kin forget oneself is easy; forgetting all under heaven is difficult. Forgetting all under heaven is easy; making all under heaven forget oneself is difficult.\n\nThe virtue of perfect benevolence leaves Yao and Shun behind without effort, its beneficence extending to ten thousand generations, yet none under heaven know it—how could it merely sigh and speak of benevolence and filial piety? Perfect benevolence is such that its virtue could be compared to Yao and Shun yet not pursued, its beneficence extending to ten thousand generations while none under heaven know it—how would it deign to sigh and boast of benevolence and filial piety?\n\nFilial devotion, fraternal respect, benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and incorruptibility—these are all self-exertions that labor one’s virtue and are not worthy of praise. Thus it is said: The most noble casts aside state rank; the most wealthy casts aside state wealth; the greatest aspiration casts aside fame and reputation. Only thus does the Dao remain unchanging.\n\nBeimen Cheng asked the Yellow Emperor: \"When Your Majesty performed the music of *Xianchi* in the wilds of Dongting, I first heard it and was afraid, then heard it again and grew weary, and finally heard it and was moved. Adrift and silent, I could not find myself.\" *Adrift* describes the unsettled spirit; *silent*, the inability to speak. *Not finding oneself* means the heart could not be at ease. The Emperor said: \"You were nearly correct. I performed it with human affairs, harmonized it with Heaven, conducted it with ritual and righteousness, and established it with the Great Purity.\n\nThe perfect music first responds to human affairs, accords with the principles of Heaven, is conducted with the Five Virtues, and answers to nature—only then does it regulate the four seasons and harmonize the myriad things. The four seasons arise in succession, and the myriad things follow their birth. Now flourishing, now declining, the patterns of civil and martial order unfold. Now clear, now turbid, yin and yang harmonize, their sounds flowing luminously. When hibernating creatures first stir, I startle them with thunder. Its end has no tail, its beginning no head. Now death, now life; now collapse, now rise—ever constant and inexhaustible, yet the One cannot be awaited.\n\nThus you were afraid. The four seasons and the myriad things speak to the spontaneity of creation. Flourishing and declining, civil and martial, clear and turbid, yin and yang—these describe their rhythms. *Their sounds flowing luminously* means their sounds flow smoothly and shine brightly. This line harmonizes the preceding rhyme, embodying the purity of following nature. When hibernating creatures first stir, I startle them with thunder. Its end has no tail, its beginning no head—it arises and ceases suddenly, like the unpredictability of thunder. Now death, now life; now collapse, now rise—ever cycling without end, yet the One cannot be awaited. Read this as a continuous passage: one death is followed by one life, one collapse by one rise, endlessly circulating, yet the One cannot be delayed. One death is followed by one life, one collapse by one rise, with no pause—how can it be awaited? Beimen Cheng, hearing the music thus, felt terror.\n\nI then performed it with the harmony of yin and yang, illuminating it with the brightness of the sun and moon. Its sounds could be short or long, soft or hard, transforming uniformly without adhering to fixed patterns. In valleys, it filled valleys; in pits, it filled pits. Stopping up the gaps, I guarded my spirit, measuring by things. Its sounds were expansive, its name lofty and bright. Thus ghosts and spirits guarded their hidden realms, while the sun, moon, and stars followed their courses. I halted it at the bounded, flowed it into the boundless. You wish to ponder it but cannot know it; to gaze upon it but cannot see it; to pursue it but cannot reach it.\n\nSuddenly standing on the Dao of the four voids, leaning against a withered catalpa and chanting: the eyes exhaust what they wish to see, strength is spent in what it wishes to pursue—I cannot attain it, so be it. The form fills the emptiness, even to the point of meandering. You meandered, thus grew weary.\" Continuing the preceding discussion of yin-yang harmony, I performed it with the harmony of yin and yang, illuminating it with the brightness of the sun and moon. Though harmonious, it had distinctions—this is what is called clarity. Its sounds could be short or long, soft or hard, transforming uniformly without adhering to fixed patterns—all embodying clarity. In valleys, it filled valleys; in pits, it filled pits—its sounds were all-pervading. *Stopping up the gaps* is like stopping the ears and covering the eyes. When my music was not performed, hearing and sight guarded their spirit, following the measure of things. The sounds received were great or small, the music’s tones expansive, its name lofty and bright.\n\nThe spirits and gods guard their hidden realms, the sun, moon, and stars follow their celestial paths—each without disorder. I halt it at the bounded, let it flow into the boundless. Sometimes halting, sometimes flowing, it has no constancy. Though you may strive to ponder it, you cannot know it; though you may gaze upon it, you cannot see it; though you may chase after it, you cannot reach it. Suddenly you stand lost amid the fourfold emptiness of the road, leaning against a withered catalpa, chanting—only to feel your vision exhausted, your strength spent. This is what is meant by \"though you wish to follow it, there is no way to do so.\" Since it cannot be attained, all you perceive is its form and image filling the void. Thus, the heart slackens and grows weary of itself.\n\nI then perform it with sounds of tirelessness, attuning it to the mandate of nature. Thus, it seems to blend and chase in profusion, like a forest of music without form; it spreads and unfurls without trailing, deep and dim without sound. It moves without direction, dwells in the obscure and unseen. Some call it death, some call it life; some call it substance, some call it glory. It flows and scatters, shifting without adhering to fixed sounds. The world doubts it and turns to the sages for verification. The sage is one who penetrates human nature and fulfills the mandate. The celestial mechanism does not unfold, yet the five offices are all complete—this is called the music of heaven. It speaks no words, yet the heart rejoices.\n\nThus, the Lord of Yan sang its praise:\n*\"Hear it, yet hear no sound;\nSee it, yet see no form.\nIt fills heaven and earth,\nEnvelops the six directions.\nYou wish to listen, yet find no point of contact—\nThus you are perplexed.\"*\n\nContinuing from the preceding discussion of weariness, I perform it with sounds of tirelessness. What is meant by tirelessness? It is attuned to the natural mandate of heaven—emerging from spontaneity, like the flowing course of heaven’s decree. Thus, its sounds seem to mingle and pursue one another in a dense profusion, growing together like a forest, rejoicing without form—this is what is called *yiru* (resonant clarity). When it scatters and arises, it exhausts itself without lingering; when it is deep and dim, it is utterly silent. Its movement has no fixed direction, its dwelling is in the profound and obscure. Some measure it and call it death, some call it life; some call it substance, some call it glory. All one sees is its flowing, scattering, and shifting, without adhering to fixed sounds. Thus, the world doubts it and examines its principles, turning to the sages for inquiry. The sage is one who understands human nature and attains the mandate. This music cannot be made by anyone but a sage.\n\nThe term *mandate* here corresponds to the earlier \"attuned to the mandate of nature.\" The celestial mechanism does not unfold—no artificial devices are employed. My offices are all complete; the governance of the five tones is fully established. The music of heaven is the spontaneous mandate itself. It speaks no words, yet the heart rejoices—its wonder cannot be captured in speech, yet the heart naturally awakens to joy.\n\nThe ode of the Lord of Yan is cited to reveal the marvel beyond sound. You seek to grasp its subtlety but find no point of contact—hence the perplexity.\n\nMusic begins with awe; awe gives rise to reverence. I follow with weariness; weariness gives rise to flight. It ends in confusion; confusion gives rise to foolishness. Foolishness gives rise to the Way, and the Way can be borne and journeyed with as one.\n\nThis concludes the three preceding sections, summarizing their ultimate return. Awe sharpens the spirit, as if haunted by ghosts and spirits—hence \"reverence.\" Weariness exhausts the heart and strength, prompting the desire to abandon it—hence \"flight.\" Confusion clouds knowledge—hence \"foolishness.\" Once foolish, one may enter the Way; once in the Way, one may ride alongside it. Thus, the discussion of music leads to the Way.\n\nThis passage resembles the performance of music in the wilds of Dongting—seemingly without beginning or end, difficult to grasp at first glance, yet upon careful examination, it has its own order. Since Confucius spoke to the Grand Music Master, even Zhuangzi, who does not merely plagiarize old words, discusses music in this way to achieve its subtlety.\n\nConfucius traveled west to Wei, and Yan Yuan asked Shi Jin (the Grand Music Master of Lu, named Jin): \"What do you think of my Master’s conduct?\"\nShi Jin replied: \"Alas! Your Master is in dire straits.\"\nYan Yuan said: \"Why?\"\nShi Jin said: \"Before a straw dog is displayed, it is kept in a fine basket, wrapped in embroidered cloth, and the priest fasts to prepare for its presentation. Once displayed, passersby trample its head and spine, and fuel-gatherers take it to burn. If one were to gather it again, place it in a fine basket, wrap it in embroidered cloth, and wander or rest beneath it, one would not only fail to dream but would surely suffer from *mi* (a condition where something enters the eye). Not only would dreams fail, but one would see omens and apparitions in the eyes. Now, your Master has taken the straw dogs of the former kings—already displayed—and leads his disciples to wander and rest beneath them. Thus, he was assaulted by the felling of a tree in Song, erased his traces in Wei, and was impoverished in Shang and Zhou—was this not like a dream? Originally, it was said one could not dream, yet now it is hastily declared, 'Was this not a dream?' Similarly, in the *Analects*, it was originally said one had not yet attained it, yet it is hastily declared, 'One fears attaining it.' He was besieged between Chen and Cai, went seven days without cooking a meal, and death and life became neighbors—was this not like *mi*? The people of Kuang mistook him for Yang Hu and besieged him, much like an apparition blinding the eyes.\n\nThe best way to travel on water is by boat, and the best way to travel on land is by cart. If, because a boat can travel on water, one seeks to push it on land, it will never move even a short distance in a lifetime. Are not past and present like water and land? Are not Zhou and Lu like boat and cart? Now, to seek to implement Zhou’s ways in Lu is like pushing a boat on land—laborious yet fruitless, and one’s person will surely suffer harm. He did not understand the transmission without fixed methods, which responds to things without exhaustion. Only by having no constant laws can one respond to the times without exhaustion.\"\n\nMoreover, have you alone not observed the well-sweep? When pulled, it bows; when released, it rises. It is drawn by others, not drawing others. Thus, it bows and rises without offending anyone. Are not the rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors like the wild pear, pear, orange, and pomelo? Their flavors differ, yet all are pleasing to the mouth. Thus, rites, righteousness, laws, and standards are things that change with the times. Now, if one were to dress an ape in the robes of the Duke of Zhou, it would surely gnaw, tear, and rend them, casting them off entirely before feeling at ease—observe here the difference between past and present, between the Duke of Zhou and today. When Xi Shi was afflicted with heart pain and knit her brows in her village, the ugly women of her village saw it and thought it beautiful. Returning home, they too clutched their chests and knit their brows. The rich of the village, seeing this, firmly shut their doors and refused to go out; the poor, seeing it, took their wives and children and fled. They knew the beauty of knitting brows but did not know why knitting brows was beautiful. Alas, how confined you are!\n\nConfucius, at the age of fifty-one, had still not heard the Dao. He then journeyed south to Pei to see Lao Dan. Lao Dan was a man of Chen, serving as minister in Ku County, which lay near Pei. Lao Dan said, “Have you come? I have heard that you are a worthy man of the north. Have you also attained the Dao?” Confucius replied, “I have not.” Lao Dan asked, “How have you sought it?” Confucius said, “I sought it in measures and numbers, yet after five years I had not attained it.” Lao Dan asked, “How else have you sought it?” Confucius said, “I sought it in yin and yang, yet after twelve years I had not attained it.” Lao Dan said, “Indeed. If the Dao could be offered, there would be none who would not offer it to their lord; if the Dao could be presented, there would be none who would not present it to their kin; if the Dao could be told to others, there would be none who would not tell it to their brothers; if the Dao could be given to others, there would be none who would not give it to their descendants. Yet this is not possible. Why? Because within, there is no master to abide, and without, there is no norm to proceed. That which issues from within is not received from without—thus the sage does not emerge. That which enters from without has no master within—thus the sage does not conceal. In one case, a person lacks a master within and cannot find where to abide. In another, there is no one without to affirm what is right, and thus one does not know how to proceed. Some may awaken to it spontaneously from within, yet without a teacher’s transmission, they refuse to receive instruction from without. Though the sage cannot cause this Dao to emerge from such a person, others may be guided by instruction from without, yet they abandon themselves and lack a master within. Though the sage cannot conceal this Dao within such a person, this is why the Dao cannot be sought.\n\nFame is a public vessel—one cannot take too much of it. Benevolence and righteousness are the travelers’ lodges of the former kings, where one may stay a single night but cannot dwell long. To be seen and held to many demands—if exposed and recognized, one will incur much blame and anger.\n\nThe perfected people of old borrowed the Way of benevolence and lodged in righteousness, roaming the wilds of carefree ease, feeding in the fields of simplicity, and standing in the gardens of non-transaction. Carefree ease is non-action; simplicity is easy sustenance; non-transaction is no expenditure. The ancients called this “roaming in the harvest of the real.” Those who take wealth as right cannot yield emolument; those who take prominence as right cannot yield fame.\n\nThose who cling to power cannot share authority with others—grasping it brings trembling, relinquishing it brings sorrow, and they see nothing clearly, only gazing endlessly at what they cannot cease pursuing. These are the people punished by Heaven. Seeing nothing of the supreme truth of the real, they only peer ceaselessly at their own unending desires—these are the people punished by Heaven.\n\nResentment, gratitude, taking, giving, admonition, instruction, life, and death—these eight are the instruments of rectification. Only those who follow great transformation without obstruction can wield them. Thus it is said: \"Rectification is rectitude.\" If one’s heart does not accept this, the Gate of Heaven remains closed. *Great transformation* means the great process of change, that is, Heaven. These eight are the tools for rectifying the world, but only by following the natural patterns of Heaven can one use them rightly: resent when resentment is due, show gratitude when gratitude is due, take when taking is due, give when giving is due, admonish when admonition is due, instruct when instruction is due, kill when killing is due, and spare when sparing is due. Only those who do not obscure these principles can wield them. Thus it is said: \"Rectification is rectitude.\" If even a trace of self-interest intrudes, it is no longer rectitude. When the world’s people reject this principle and insist on imposing their private will, they remain utterly blind to the patterns of Heaven—like the Gate of Heaven never opening.\n\nConfucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Lao Dan said: \"When chaff gets in your eyes, heaven and earth and the four directions seem to shift places. When mosquitoes and horseflies bite your skin, you cannot sleep all night. But benevolence and righteousness are far more grievous—they agitate the heart, and no disorder is greater. You would have the world not lose its simplicity, yet you yourself follow the wind and move, gathering virtue to stand tall. Why must you act so strenuously, like one carrying a drum in search of a lost child? Displaying lost righteousness to others is like striking a drum to find a missing child.\n\nThe egret does not bathe daily to stay white, nor the crow blacken itself daily to stay black. Black and white are their natural qualities, not worth debating. The spectacle of fame and reputation is not worth expanding. When a spring dries up, fish gather on dry land, puffing moisture at each other, moistening each other with foam—better to forget each other in rivers and lakes.\"\n\nConfucius visited Lao Dan and returned, silent for three days. His disciples asked: \"Master, when you saw Lao Dan, what correction did you seek?\" Confucius said: \"Only now have I seen the dragon. The dragon coalesces into ritual, disperses into pattern, rides the clouds and qi, and nourishes itself in yin and yang. My mouth gaped open, unable to close—what correction could I offer Lao Dan?\"\n\nZigong said: \"Then are there truly people who dwell like corpses yet manifest like dragons, thunder in voice yet plumb the depths in silence, moving like heaven and earth? Might I witness such a one?\" He then spoke of Confucius’ reputation to Lao Dan. Lao Dan was sitting in the hall and responded faintly: \"My years advance and depart—what warning do you bring me?\"\n\nZigong said: \"The governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors differed, yet their renown was the same. Why do you alone consider them not sages?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Young man, come closer. Why do you say they differed?\" Zigong replied: \"Yao passed the throne to Shun, Shun to Yu. Yu relied on labor, Tang on force; King Wen submitted to Zhou without daring to oppose, while King Wu opposed Zhou without submitting. Thus I say they differed.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Young man, come closer, and I will tell you of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors’ governance of the world. The Yellow Emperor’s rule made the people’s hearts unified—when someone’s parent died and they did not weep, none criticized them. Yao’s rule made the people’s hearts affectionate—when someone shortened mourning for a parent, none criticized them. Shun’s rule made the people’s hearts competitive—pregnant women gave birth at ten months, children spoke at five months, and before they could even crawl, people began to distinguish themselves. Yu’s rule made the people’s hearts change—each had their own intentions, and weapons had their own justifications. Killing bandits was not considered killing people. Each made their own kind, and the world was thus divided. The world was greatly alarmed, and the Confucians and Mohists arose. Their beginnings had order, yet now even women speak of it—what can be said?\n\nWhen someone shortened mourning for a parent, they reduced the five degrees of mourning from the highest. *People began to distinguish themselves* means that when the time came, it was natural; to do so prematurely was to impose human will on Heaven. *Weapons had their justifications* means that warfare became a matter of course. *Killing bandits was not considered killing* means that killing bandits was not yet killing—only killing in wars over land and cities was called killing. *Each made their own kind* means that originally, all under Heaven were one undifferentiated whole; now they divided into kinds, and this was called the world. *Their beginnings had order, yet now even women speak of it* means that the institution of marriage rites was meant to establish human order, yet now when women marry, the proper human relations are corrupted.\n\nI tell you: the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors’ governance of the world was called *governance*, yet no disorder was greater. The institutions of the Three Sovereigns obscured the brightness of sun and moon above, estranged the essence of mountains and rivers below, and disrupted the operations of the four seasons in between. Their wisdom was as cruel as the sting of a scorpion’s tail or a venomous snake’s fang. None could preserve the naturalness of their lives, yet they still called themselves sages—is this not shameful? Truly, it is shameless.\"\n\nZigong stood uneasily, shifting his feet. Confucius said to Lao Dan: \"I have studied the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn*—the Six Classics—for a long time, and thought I thoroughly understood their principles. I have sought audience with seventy-two rulers, expounding the Way of the former kings and clarifying the traces of the Zhou and Shao, yet not one ruler took up my words.\"\n\n\"The application—how extreme it is! Is it truly so difficult to persuade rulers, or is the Dao so hard to illuminate?\"\n\nLao Dan said, \"Fortunate indeed that you have not encountered a ruler of a well-ordered age. The Six Classics are but the worn traces of the former kings. Traces are what the footwear leaves behind, yet are traces the footwear itself? When white egrets gaze at one another, their pupils do not move, yet the wind of transformation stirs; when the male cries upon the upwind, the female responds from downwind, and the wind of transformation stirs. Each becomes its own male or female, thus the wind of transformation arises. Nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, and the Dao cannot be obstructed. If one attains the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be; if one loses it, there is nothing that can be.\"\n\nBefore three months had passed, Confucius sought audience again, saying, \"I have grasped it! Crows and magpies nurture their young, fish coat their eggs with foam, and wasps transform grubs—each follows its own transformation. Yet when a younger brother is born, the elder weeps.\"\n\n\"For too long, I have not acted as others act. If I do not transform with others, how can I transform them?\"\n\nLao Dan said, \"Good. You have grasped it. Crows and magpies raising their chicks is the constant principle of things. Fish coating their eggs with foam need not be like crows and magpies. As for wasps carrying grubs and transforming them, this is yet again not like fish. Observing their transformations, which is real? Which is false? Yet when humans bear children, they cling desperately to kinship, unaware that love grows distorted with age and rank. Thus, an elder brother cannot find peace when a younger brother is born—even creatures are not so foolish. That single word 'weeps' is deeply poignant. One who does not transform with others does not follow their change. If I do not follow their transformation, how can I expect others to follow mine? How then can I transform them?\"\n\n**Outer Chapters: Autumn Floods**\n\nWhen the autumn floods came, the hundred rivers poured into the Yellow River. The surging currents swelled so vast that between its banks and isles, oxen and horses could not be distinguished. The turbid flow obscured all—so distant were the shores that sight failed.\n\nThen the River Lord rejoiced, exulting that all the world’s beauty was his alone. Following the current eastward, he reached the Northern Sea. Gazing east, he saw no end to the waters. Thereupon, the River Lord turned his face in dismay, looked toward Ruo with a sigh, and said:\n\n\"There is a rustic saying: *'Hearing a hundred truths, one thinks none surpasses oneself.'* That is I. I once heard men belittle Confucius’ learning and mock Boyi’s righteousness, and I did not believe them. Now that I behold the boundlessness of your realm, had I not come to your gate, I would have been in peril—forever ridiculed by those of great understanding.\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea replied: \"A frog in a well cannot speak of the sea, for it is confined by its hollow. A summer insect cannot speak of ice, for it is bound by its season. A narrow scholar cannot speak of the Dao, for he is shackled by his teachings. Now that you have emerged from your banks and beheld the great sea, you know your own insignificance—only then can you be spoken with of great principles.\n\nOf all the waters under heaven, none is greater than the sea. The ten thousand rivers flow into it, yet it never fills, though none knows when they cease. The Tail Pit drains it, yet it never empties, though none knows when it ends. Unchanged by spring or autumn, unmoved by flood or drought, its measure surpasses the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow River beyond all reckoning. Yet I have never prided myself on this, for I compare my form to heaven and earth, and receive my qi from yin and yang. I stand between heaven and earth like a pebble or twig upon a great mountain. Aware of my own smallness, how could I boast?\n\nConsider the Four Seas within heaven and earth—are they not like a crevice in a marsh? Consider the Central States within the seas—are they not like a grain of millet in a granary? We number things by the tens of thousands, yet humanity is but one among them. All the people of the Nine Provinces, where grain is grown and boats and carts traverse, are but one among them. Compared to the ten thousand things, is this not like the tip of a hair upon a horse’s body?\n\nThe Five Emperors’ succession, the Three Kings’ strife, the benevolent men’s worries, the devoted scholars’ toils—all are encompassed herein. Boyi renounced it to gain fame; Confucius discoursed on it to display his erudition. Their self-importance—was it not like your former pride in your waters?\"\n\nThe River Lord said, \"Then may I esteem heaven and earth as great and the tip of a hair as small?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said, \"No. Things have no fixed measure, time no ceasing, divisions no constancy, beginnings and ends no permanence. Thus, the man of great wisdom observes near and far, so that the small does not seem few, nor the great many—for he knows measure is boundless. He verifies past and present, so that the distant does not weary him, nor the near make him strain—for he knows time has no end. He examines fullness and emptiness, so that gain does not elate him, nor loss grieve him—for he knows divisions have no constancy. He understands the level path, so that life does not delight him, nor death afflict him—for he knows beginnings and ends have no permanence.\n\nWhat a man knows is less than what he does not know; the time of his life is less than the time before his birth.\"\n\nSeeking to exhaust the realm of the utmost greatness through that which is most minute—this is why one becomes confused and cannot attain self-realization.\n\nFrom this perspective, how can one know that the tip of a hair suffices to determine the boundary of the most subtle, or that heaven and earth suffice to exhaust the realm of the utmost greatness?\n\nThe Lord of the River said, \"All the debaters of the world say that the most refined has no form, and the greatest cannot be encompassed. Is this truly so?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea replied, \"One who views the great from the perspective of the small cannot see it in full; one who views the small from the perspective of the great cannot discern it clearly. The refined is the subtlest of the small; the vast is the fullness of the great—thus they differ in their advantages. This is the nature of their conditions.\n\nThe refined and the coarse pertain to what has form; what has no form cannot be divided by numbers; what cannot be encompassed cannot be exhausted by numbers. What can be discussed in words is the coarse aspect of things; what can be grasped by intention is the refined aspect of things. What cannot be discussed in words, nor grasped by intention, does not pertain to the refined or the coarse.\n\nThus, the conduct of the great man: he does not act to harm others, nor does he boast of benevolence and kindness; he does not move for the sake of profit, nor does he despise menial servants; he does not contend over wealth and goods, nor does he pride himself on yielding; in affairs, he does not rely on others, nor does he boast of living by his own strength, nor does he despise the greedy and corrupt. His conduct differs from the common, yet he does not pride himself on being eccentric; his actions follow the multitude, yet he does not despise flatterers and sycophants. The world’s ranks and emoluments are insufficient to encourage him; disgrace and punishment are insufficient to shame him. He knows that right and wrong cannot be fixed as divisions, nor can the subtle and the great be determined as boundaries.\n\nIt is said: The man of the Dao does not strive for fame; the utmost virtue does not seek attainment; the great man has no self. This is the utmost of restrained destiny.\n\nThe conduct of the great man fundamentally does not harm others, nor does he consider benevolence and kindness as something to boast of. Fundamentally, he does not act for profit, nor does he despise menial servants—those who chase after gain. Fundamentally, he does not contend over wealth and goods, nor does he pride himself on his ability to yield. Fundamentally, in his affairs, he does not rely on others, nor does he consider living by his own strength as something to boast of. Nor does he despise the greedy and corrupt—those who do not hold to themselves but seek from others. His conduct fundamentally differs from worldly customs, yet he does not pride himself on being eccentric. His actions lie in following the multitude, and he does not despise flatterers and sycophants. He does not live by others’ strength—the following three phrases share a single meaning. His conduct differs from the common—the following four phrases share a single meaning. The utmost of restrained destiny is the extreme of restraint in one’s allotted portion, to the point of being indivisible and unassignable.\n\n*Ni* refers to the tip of a hair. Yet even this has its order, like the bearing of heaven and earth—soundless and scentless, this is the utmost.\n\nThe Lord of the River said, \"Beyond things, within things—where do distinctions of noble and base arise? Where do distinctions of small and great arise?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea replied, \"Viewed through the Dao, things have no noble or base. Viewed through things themselves, each esteems itself and deems others base. Viewed through custom, noble and base do not lie within oneself.\n\nViewed through differentiation: if one magnifies what is great in each, then nothing in the world is not great; if one diminishes what is small in each, then nothing in the world is not small. Knowing that heaven and earth are but a grain of millet, and that the tip of a hair is a mountain—then the distinctions of measurement become apparent.\n\nViewed through function: if one affirms what each possesses, then nothing in the world does not possess; if one negates what each lacks, then nothing in the world does not lack. Knowing that east and west are opposites yet cannot be without each other—then the divisions of function are settled.\n\nViewed through inclination: if one affirms what each affirms, then nothing in the world is not affirmed; if one negates what each negates, then nothing in the world is not negated. Knowing that Yao and Jie each affirmed their own ways and negated the other—then the inclinations of conduct become apparent.\n\nIn ancient times, Yao and Shun yielded the throne and became emperors; Zhi and Kuai yielded the throne and perished. Tang and Wu fought and became kings; the Duke of Bai fought and was destroyed. From this, we see that the rites of contention and yielding, the conduct of Yao and Jie, noble and base have their times—these cannot be taken as constant.\n\nA beam and a pillar are the same, yet one can batter down a city wall while the other cannot plug a hole—this speaks of differing implements. The fine steeds Qi Ji and Hua Liu can gallop a thousand *li* in a day, yet they cannot catch mice as well as a wildcat—this speaks of differing skills. The owl can seize fleas at night and discern the tip of a hair, yet in daylight it stares and cannot see a mountain—this speaks of differing natures.\n\nThus it is said: Should one take 'this' as the standard and reject 'not-this,' or take order as the standard and reject disorder? This is to fail to understand the principles of heaven and earth and the conditions of the myriad things. It is like taking heaven as the standard and rejecting earth, or taking yin as the standard and rejecting yang—its impossibility is clear. Yet if one still insists on speaking without ceasing, one is either foolish or deceitful.\n\nThe abdications of emperors and kings differed; the successions of the Three Dynasties differed. Those who go against their times and defy customs are called usurpers; those who accord with their times and follow customs are called righteous men.\n\nSilent, O Lord of the River—how could you know the gate of noble and base, the house of small and great?\"\n\nThe Lord of the River said, \"Then what should I do? What should I not do? How should I determine what to accept or reject, what to pursue or abandon? What am I to do in the end?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"From the perspective of the Dao, what is noble and what is base? This is called 'reversed extension.' If one clings to rigid intentions, one greatly obstructs the Dao. What is few and what is many? This is called 'reciprocal bestowal.' If one acts with singular focus, one deviates from the Dao.\n\nMajestic as a state with its ruler—it grants no private virtue. Reverent as a sacrifice with its altar—it confers no private blessing. Boundless as the four directions without end—it has no boundaries. Embracing the myriad things, who bears them up? This is called 'without fixed direction.'\n\nThe myriad things are equal; what is short and what is long? The Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and life, yet do not rely on their completion. Now empty, now full, they do not abide in their forms. Years cannot be lifted; time cannot be halted. Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness—when one ends, another begins. This is how we speak of the great principles and discuss the patterns of the myriad things.\n\nThings come into being as if galloping, as if racing. No movement without change, no moment without shift. What is to be done? What is not to be done? They will naturally transform of themselves.\n\n'Extension' means to draw out and lengthen. From the perspective of the Dao, there is fundamentally no nobility or baseness. If one takes nobility and baseness as opposites and extends them, one knows not how many degrees they span. From the standpoint of dukes and ministers, dukes are noble and ministers base; from the standpoint of ministers and grand masters, ministers are noble and grand masters base. Thus it is said: without nobility, without baseness—this is called 'reversed extension.' If one clings to one’s intentions, insisting that this is noble and that is base, one obstructs the Dao.\n\n'Reciprocal bestowal' is repayment. Those who repay others’ bestowals must calculate what is more and what is less. If one acts with singular focus, determining what is more and what is less to repay, one deviates from the Dao.\n\n'Reverent' here is akin to Mencius’s 'contented.' 'Embracing the myriad things, who bears them up?' speaks of loving all things without perceiving the merit of their support.\n\nThe Lord of the River said: \"Then what is noble about the Dao?\"\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"Those who know the Dao must comprehend its principles; those who comprehend its principles must understand its adaptability; those who understand its adaptability do not allow things to harm themselves.\n\nThe utmost in virtue—fire cannot burn them, water cannot drown them, cold and heat cannot harm them, birds and beasts cannot injure them. This does not mean they slight these things, but that they discern safety and danger, remain tranquil amid fortune and misfortune, are cautious in approach and retreat, and thus nothing can harm them. Thus it is said: Heaven is within, man is without; virtue resides in Heaven.\n\nKnow that human conduct is rooted in Heaven, positioned in attainment, and moves in accord with the turning of hooves—bending and stretching, returning to the essential and speaking of the ultimate.\"\n\nThe Lord of the River said: \"What is Heaven? What is man?\"\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"Oxen and horses having four legs is called Heaven; bridling a horse’s head, piercing an ox’s nose is called man. Thus it is said: Do not let man obliterate Heaven, do not let the artificial obliterate fate, do not let gain be sacrificed for reputation. Guard this carefully and do not lose it—this is called returning to one’s true nature.\n\nKui pitied the centipede, the centipede pitied the snake, the snake pitied the wind, the wind pitied the eye, the eye pitied the mind.\n\nKui said to the centipede: 'I leap and stride with my single foot—nothing compares to me. Now you move with ten thousand feet—how do you manage?'\nThe centipede said: 'Not so. Have you not seen one who spits?'\"\n\nThe spray scatters—some droplets large as pearls, some fine as mist, falling in countless profusion. Now I move by my Heavenly mechanism, yet know not how it comes to be.\n\nThe centipede said to the snake: \"I walk with many feet, yet cannot match your footless stride—why is this?\"\nThe snake replied: \"How can one alter what the Heavenly mechanism sets in motion? What need have I for feet?\"\n\nThe snake said to the wind: \"I move by flexing my spine and ribs—there is something to it. Yet you rise in a great rush from the Northern Sea, rush into the Southern Sea, and seem as if you were nothing at all—why is this?\"\nThe wind said: \"Indeed. I rise in a great rush from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea, yet a finger can overpower me, a toe can trample me. I, too, am overpowered by myself. Nevertheless, to snap great trees and topple mighty halls—only I can do this. Thus, to turn many small defeats into a great victory is the greatest victory of all. Only the sage can achieve this.\"\n\nConfucius was traveling in Kuang when men of Song surrounded him in several rings, yet he continued playing his zither and singing without pause. Zilu entered and said: \"Why is the Master so at ease?\"\nConfucius replied: \"Come, let me tell you. I have long sought to avoid adversity, yet cannot escape it—this is fate. I have long sought success, yet cannot attain it—this is timing. In the age of Yao and Shun, there were no men in adversity, not because of their wisdom; in the age of Jie and Zhou, there were no men of success, not because of their folly: the circumstances of the times made it so. The fisherman who travels the waters without fear of dragons and serpents shows courage; the hunter who travels the land without fear of rhinoceroses and tigers shows courage; but to know that adversity is a matter of fate, that success comes with timing, and to face great peril without fear—this is the courage of the sage. You, Zilu, take your place. My fate is governed by something beyond me.\"\n\nNot long after, armored soldiers advanced and declared: \"We mistook you for Yang Hu, hence the siege. Now that we see our error, we beg leave to withdraw.\"\n\nGongsun Long questioned Wei Mou, saying: \"In my youth, I studied the Way of the former kings; in maturity, I mastered the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I harmonized sameness and difference, separated hardness and whiteness; affirmed the untrue, negated the possible—baffling the wisdom of the hundred schools, exhausting the eloquence of all disputants. I took myself for one of perfect understanding. Yet now I hear the words of Zhuangzi, and feel only bewildered estrangement. Do I fall short in debate? Or do I simply lack his depth of insight? Now my beak hangs open—I dare ask: what is the method?\"\n\nPrince Mou leaned against his desk, sighed deeply, looked to the heavens, and laughed: \"Have you never heard of the frog in the shallow well? It said to the turtle of the Eastern Sea: 'How joyful I am! I leap and prance upon the well’s railing, rest upon the broken bricks of its walls. When I plunge into the water, it supports my armpits and cradles my chin; when I trample the mud, it swallows my feet and ankles. I turn to look at the shrimp, crabs, and tadpoles—none can match me. Moreover, to command the waters of this single ravine and straddle the joys of this shallow well—what more could one desire? Why not come and see for yourself?'\n\nThe turtle of the Eastern Sea had not yet set its left foot inside when its right knee was already pinned. It retreated in hesitation and told the sea: 'A distance of a thousand *li* cannot convey its vastness; a height of a thousand *ren* cannot plumb its depths. In the time of Yu, nine years out of ten saw floods, yet the waters did not increase; in the time of Tang, seven years out of eight saw drought, yet the shores did not diminish. Unchanged by the passage of moments or ages, unmoved by the ebb and flow of quantity—this is the great joy of the Eastern Sea.'\n\nWhen the frog in the shallow well heard this, it was struck dumb with astonishment, its gaze wandering in dismay, utterly lost. Now, if you cannot even discern the bounds of right and wrong, yet still wish to examine Zhuangzi’s words, it is like making a mosquito bear a mountain or a millipede race across a river—surely beyond your strength. And if you grasp not the subtleties of his discourse, yet seek only momentary advantage, are you not the frog in the shallow well?\n\nMoreover, he treads the Yellow Springs and ascends the Great Vast, unbound by south or north, released in all four directions, submerged in the unfathomable; unbound by east or west, beginning in the dark and obscure, returning to the Great Thoroughfare. Yet you would measure him with narrow scrutiny, seek him with argument—is this not like gazing at the sky through a tube or pointing at the earth with an awl? Is it not petty? Begone!\n\nHave you not heard of the young man from Shouling who went to Handan to learn its walk? Before mastering the state’s skill, he forgot his old gait and could only crawl home. If you do not leave now, you will forget your former ways and lose your craft.\"\n\nGongsun Long’s mouth gaped open, his tongue lifted and would not descend; he fled in haste.\n\nZhuangzi was fishing in the Pu River when the King of Chu sent two ministers to approach him first, saying: \"I wish to trouble you with the affairs of my realm.\"\n\nZhuangzi held his rod and did not turn, saying: \"I have heard that in Chu there is a sacred tortoise, dead for three thousand years. The king keeps it wrapped in silk and stored in a casket in his ancestral temple. Would this tortoise rather have died to leave its bones venerated, or lived to drag its tail through the mud?\"\n\nThe two ministers said: \"It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Go away. I will drag my tail through the mud.\"\n\nWhen Huizi was prime minister of Liang, Zhuangzi went to visit him. Someone told Huizi: \"Zhuangzi is coming to replace you as minister.\" Huizi grew alarmed and searched the state for three days and three nights.\n\nZhuangzi went to see him and said: \"In the south there is a bird called the *yuanchu*—do you know it? The *yuanchu* sets out from the Southern Sea and flies to the Northern Sea; it alights only on the *wutong* tree, eats only bamboo fruit, and drinks only sweet spring water. Then a *chi* hawk, clutching a rotten rat, saw the *yuanchu* pass overhead and looked up, crying: '*Ha!*' Now do you mean to frighten me with your state of Liang?\"\n\nZhuangzi and Huizi strolled upon the bridge over the Hao River. Zhuangzi said: \"The *tiao* fish swim leisurely—this is the joy of fish.\"\n\nHuizi said: \"You are not a fish—how do you know their joy?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"You are not me—how do you know I do not know the joy of fish?\"\n\nHuizi said: \"I am not you, so of course I do not know you; but you are certainly not a fish, so your ignorance of the fish’s joy is complete.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Let us return to the beginning. When you said, 'How do you know the joy of fish?' you already knew I knew it, yet you asked me. I know it from here, above the Hao.\"\n\nHuizi said: \"As you put it, I am not you, so of course I do not know you. But you are certainly not a fish, so your ignorance of the fish’s joy is complete. That you and I are both human is evident. You and the fish are different kinds—your complete lack of mutual understanding is clear.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Let us return to the beginning. Originally, we spoke only of the joy of fish, but then came the debate over knowledge. Now, let us follow the original thread. When you said, 'How do you know the joy of fish?' you already knew I knew it, yet you asked me deliberately. Now, as for how I know the joy of fish—I know it from here, above the Hao. The fish advance in the river, and I wander above it. Our joys are linked, an unplanned harmony—like bathing in the Yi or dancing in the wind at the *wuyu*.\"\n\n**Outer Chapters: Supreme Joy**\n\nIs there in the world a supreme joy, or is there none? Are there means to preserve life, or are there none? What should one do now, and what rely upon? What avoid, and where abide? What pursue, and what forsake? What find joy in, and what detest?\n\nWhat the world honors are wealth, nobility, long life, and goodness; what it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful sights, and sweet sounds. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and wickedness; what it finds bitter are the body denied comfort, the mouth denied rich flavors, the form denied fine garments, the eyes denied beautiful sights, and the ears denied sweet sounds. If these are not attained, one is gripped by great sorrow and fear—how foolishly this treats the body!\n\nThe wealthy exhaust themselves with toil, amassing wealth they cannot fully use—how estranged this is from the body. The noble pass days and nights in ceaseless calculation, weighing good and ill—how distant this is from the body. As for human life, it is born with sorrow. The long-lived grow dull and muddled, enduring long sorrow without death—what agony this is! How far removed from the body!\n\nThe steadfast man is praised by the world for his goodness, yet it is not enough to preserve his life. Do I know whether goodness is truly good? Or truly not good? If we deem it good, it is not enough to preserve life; if we deem it not good, it is enough to preserve others. It is said: \"When loyal remonstrance is unheeded, crouch low and follow—do not contend.\" Thus when Wu Zixu contended, his body was destroyed; had he not contended, his name would not have endured. Is there truly goodness, or is there none?\n\nAs for what the vulgar do and delight in, do I know whether their joy is truly joy? Or truly not joy? I observe that what the vulgar delight in is the clamor of the crowd, rushing together in a clanging throng as if they cannot help themselves. Yet all call it joy—do I find it joyful? Or do I not? I do not know whether it is truly joy or not. Is there truly joy, or is there none?\n\nI take non-action as true joy, yet this is what the vulgar find most bitter. Thus it is said: \"Supreme joy is no joy; supreme praise is no praise.\" The right and wrong of the world cannot truly be settled. Nevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong. Supreme joy preserves life—only non-action comes close to this.\n\nLet me try to speak of it: Heaven is clear through non-action; Earth is tranquil through non-action. Thus when the two non-actions combine, the myriad things are transformed. Vague and indistinct, from whence do they emerge? Indistinct and vague, without form do they appear? The ten thousand things, teeming and thriving, all grow from non-action. Thus it is said: \"Heaven and Earth act through non-action, yet there is nothing they do not do.\" Who among men can attain non-action?\n\nWhen Zhuangzi’s wife died, Huizi came to offer condolences. Zhuangzi was squatting with legs spread, drumming on a basin and singing. Huizi said: \"To live with someone, raise a child to adulthood, and grow old together—if upon her death you do not weep, it would be enough. But to drum on a basin and sing—is this not excessive?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Not so. When she first died, how could I alone not feel grief? Yet I examined her beginning and found she was originally without life. Not only without life, but originally without form; not only without form, but originally without *qi*. Amidst the vague and indistinct, there was transformation, and *qi* arose; the *qi* transformed and form arose; form transformed and life arose. Now it has transformed again into death. This is like the procession of the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer. She now lies peacefully in the great chamber, and if I were to wail and weep after her, I would consider myself ignorant of fate. Thus I stopped.\"\n\nZhilishu and Gujieshu were observing the mound of Mingbo, the ruins of Kunlun, where the Yellow Emperor once dwelled. Suddenly, a willow sprouted from Gujieshu’s left elbow, and he was startled and dismayed. Zhilishu said: \"Do you detest it?\"\n\nGujieshu replied: \"No—why should I detest it? Life is but a temporary borrowing. What borrows and gives rise to life is but dust and grime. Death and life are like day and night. Moreover, you and I observe transformation, and transformation has reached me—why should I detest it?\"\n\nMingbo is a term for the dead, like the \"Lord of the Dark\" in the *Wen Xuan*. The mound of Mingbo is a burial ground, located in the ruins of Kunlun. Kunlun has five cities and twelve towers, the abode of immortals. The Yellow Emperor was an ancient ruler who attained the Dao and ascended as an immortal. These words express sorrowful reminiscence: this man dwells in the realm of immortals yet cannot, like the Yellow Emperor, cultivate immortality and thus faces death.\n\nThe willow refers to the funeral bier. In the *Tan Gong*, the Zhou people placed *sha* on the walls. The commentary states: \"The wall is the *liu* covering.\" The *Zhengyi* says: \"The wall that screens the bier is like a wall screening a house, hence the screening object is called a wall. The wall is the *liu*.\" The *Feng Ren* commentary: \"*Liu* means gathering—the gathering of all adornments.\" Zhilishu and Gujieshu were observing among the mounds and ruins of the burial ground when, by the power of their thoughts, a willow for screening the bier suddenly sprouted from Gujieshu’s left elbow. An ominous sign—he was about to die. Thus he was startled and dismayed.\n\nZhilishu, though dismayed, asked Gujieshu: \"Do you detest it?\" Gujieshu replied: \"No—why should I detest it? What has life is but a temporary borrowing. This is what is meant by the four great elements provisionally combining. Since it is but a borrowing that gives rise to life, it is no more than dust and grime gathering together.\"\n\n\"Why cling or struggle? Thus he spoke: life and death are but day and night—this is the constant principle of the Dao, not worth alarm or dread. Life is but a temporary borrowing, and in this discourse on human life and death, the character for 'life' (*sheng*) does not again adhere to the earlier instance—here, it refers to the 'growth' (*sheng*) on his left elbow. Moreover, you and I observe transformation, and transformation has now reached us. Transformation means death.\n\nMencius said: *'Among those who face transformation, let no soil cling to the skin.'* This means that you and I came to the burial grounds to observe others' deaths, yet witnessed this ominous sign—death was about to reach us. If all men must die, then I too must die. Why should I detest it?\"\n\nSome mistakenly take *liu* (柳) to mean the willow tree, but this misinterprets the passage’s meaning.\n\nWhen Zhuangzi traveled to Chu, he saw an empty skull, bleached and still retaining form. He struck it with his horsewhip and questioned it: \"Did you, sir, covet life and lose the Way, bringing this upon yourself? Or did you suffer the fall of a state or the execution of the axe? Or did you commit some shameful deed, bringing disgrace upon your parents, wife, and children? Or did you endure the miseries of cold and hunger? Or did your years simply come to this end?\"\n\nHaving finished speaking, he took the skull as a pillow and lay down. At midnight, the skull appeared in a dream and said: \"Your words resemble those of a sophist. All you have spoken of are the burdens of the living—death knows none of these. Would you hear the truth of death?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Yes.\"\n\nThe skull replied: \"In death, there is no ruler above nor minister below, nor the affairs of the four seasons. At ease, one takes heaven and earth as spring and autumn. Even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass it.\"\n\nZhuangzi, unconvinced, said: \"If I had the Controller of Fate restore your form, giving you bones, flesh, and skin, and returning you to your parents, wife, children, neighbors, and acquaintances—would you desire this?\"\n\nThe skull frowned deeply and said: \"How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south to return to the toils of the human world?\"\n\nWhen Yan Hui traveled east to Qi, Confucius wore a troubled expression. Zigong rose from his mat and asked: \"May I dare ask why, when Yan Hui went east to Qi, you bear such a worried look?\"\n\nConfucius replied: \"Excellent question. Long ago, Guanzi spoke words I deeply admired: *'A small sack cannot hold a large object; a short rope cannot draw from the deep.'* Such is the way of fate—it has its completion, and form has its proper place. Neither can be diminished or augmented. I fear that Yan Hui will speak to the Marquis of Qi of the Ways of Yao, Shun, and the Yellow Emperor, and further cite the words of Suiren and Shennong. The marquis will search within himself and find nothing, and finding nothing, he will be perplexed. Perplexity in a man leads to death.\n\nHave you not heard the tale? Once, a seabird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu received it with ceremony, feasted it in the ancestral temple, performed the *Nine Shao* as music, and prepared a grand sacrifice as its meal. The bird, however, grew dazed and sorrowful, dared not eat a single morsel, nor drink a single cup, and died after three days. This was nourishing the bird as one nourishes oneself, not as a bird ought to be nourished. To nourish a bird as a bird, one should let it roost in deep forests, roam open plains, float upon rivers and lakes, feed on minnows and eels, follow its flock in flight, and rest at ease. It detests the clamor of human speech—why subject it to such clamor?\n\nWhen the music of *Xianchi* and *Nine Shao* was played in the wilds of Dongting, birds heard it and flew away, beasts heard it and fled, fish heard it and dove deep, while men, upon hearing it, gathered to listen. Fish live in water and thrive, yet men drown in it. Their natures differ, and so do their likes and dislikes. Thus the sages of old did not impose a single standard of ability nor demand uniformity in affairs. Names were confined to reality, and principles were set according to what was fitting—this is called 'orderly coherence and sustained good fortune.'\"\n\nLiezi was traveling when he stopped to eat by the roadside. From the *Liezi*: The character *cong* (从) below has *zhe* (者), and below *zhi* (指) has *gu* (顾). He said to his disciples, \"Bai Feng...\"\n\nUpon seeing a century-old skull, he plucked a stalk of mugwort and pointed at it, saying: \"Only you and I know that you have never died, nor have I ever been born. Are you truly nourished? Am I truly joyful? Seeds contain *qi*—when they encounter water, they become *jue* (絶); at the border of water and soil, they become the raiment of frogs and clams. Born on mounds, they become *lingxi* (陵舄); when *lingxi* finds damp shade, it becomes *wuzu* (乌足); the root of *wuzu* becomes *qicao* (蛴螬), while its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies, in turn, transform into insects, born beneath the hearth, their form like a cast-off skin, named *quduo* (鸲掇). After a thousand days, *quduo* becomes a bird called *ganyugu* (乾余骨). The foam of *ganyugu* becomes *simi* (斯弥), and *simi* becomes *shixi* (食酰). *Yilu* (颐辂) arises from *shixi*, *huangkuang* (黄軦) from *jiuyou* (九猷), *maorui* (瞀芮) from rotten grubs, *yangxi* (羊奚) from withered bamboo, old bamboo gives birth to *qingning* (青宁), *qingning* to *cheng* (程), *cheng* to horses, horses to humans—and humans, in turn, return to the *mechanism*. All things emerge from the *mechanism* and return to the *mechanism*. In life, they depend on nourishment; in death, they bear no burden—yet still, we fear. If you have never died and I have never been born, how can we know that you are not nourished or that I am not joyful?\n\n(For the passage beginning \"Seeds contain *qi*,\" the meaning is not entirely clear; here, only what can be understood is excerpted. *Jue* (□) is the ancient form of *jue* (絶). When earth reaches water, it is cut off—yet even there, things are born. At the intersection of water and soil, they become the raiment of frogs and clams. The raiment of frogs and clams is *shuixi* (水舄), the aquatic variety—what the *Book of Songs* calls \"gathering the *xu* (藚),\" referring to frogs and clams, which use it as their covering. Born on mounds, it becomes *lingxi* (陵舄), what the *Book of Songs* calls *fuyi* (芣苡), commonly known as *cheqian* grass. The same thing takes different forms in water and on land. *Shixi* (食酰) is the midge. *Qingning* (青宁) is the bamboo-root grub. An old man once said he saw a worm over five inches long, with another inch or so still attached—was this not the bamboo-root grub before its transformation, the so-called *qingning*? While staying in Anxiang, I saw a white moth fly into a lamp, and suddenly, one after another appeared behind it—not from birth, but from empty transformation. I also saw in Dongting Lake a mountain called Mingshan, its peak crowned with Yu’s Temple and many households. Every late spring, *quchun* (□鹑) swarm the temple and homes, swept up with bamboo brooms and pickled into vinegar. Merchants pay in advance, and at harvest, some remain half-transformed, still resembling mice—this is what the *Monthly Ordinances* calls \"field mice turning into *ru* (鴽).\" Observing this, how can one doubt the boundless transformations of heaven and earth simply because they lie beyond our senses?\n\nHorses give birth to humans, and humans return to the *mechanism*—how is this different from the Buddhist doctrine of reincarnation? Yet the Buddhist account is rigid: if one did evil in a past life, one may be reborn as a dog or horse, and only after exhausting one’s karma does one return to human form. What evidence supports this? Zhuangzi’s version is more fluid: all things emerge from the *mechanism* and return to the *mechanism*. The *mechanism* is where *qi* moves. To emerge from it is birth; to return to it is death. Between heaven and earth, there is only *yin* and *yang qi*, which generate the myriad things. In death, *yang qi* returns to heaven and *yin qi* to earth—yet this *qi* never leaves the realm of heaven and earth. Tomorrow, it will generate things anew, just as before, for it is merely *yin* and *yang qi* at work. One must not mistake a dead horse for a living person, or a dead person for a living horse.\n\nFrom *Master Zhu’s Recorded Sayings*: Zhang Hengqu said, \"When form dissolves, it returns to the origin to become human again. The thing we receive at birth, upon death, returns to the great origin. Then, from within, it is drawn out anew—this is most evident in human birth. If we followed the Buddhist account, heaven and earth would have to contain countless separate clusters of *qi*, each cycling through birth and death, entangled without end—how could this align with the workings of creation?\"\n\nFrom the *Brush Notes*: The people of Yanzhou still call tigers and leopards *cheng* (程), meaning \"worm.\" *The Authentic Scripture of Southern Florescence*, following the original text of Chapter Seventeen (the character *zhu* (诸) was emended to *shi* (视) in common editions).\n\n**From the Eighteenth Scroll of the *Authentic Scripture of Southern Florescence*, Following the Original Text**\n*(Recorded by Lu Ling’s Bamboo Peak Scholar Luo Miandao; collated by his disciple Peng Xiang)*\n\n**Outer Chapters: \"Attaining Life\"**\n\nOne who attains the essence of life does not strive for what is not essential to life.\n*\"Not essential\"*—as in the *Analects*: \"There is no need for this.\"\nThis speaks of such uselessness.\n\nOne who attains the essence of fate does not strive for what knowledge cannot alter.\n\nTo nourish the form, one must first attend to external things—yet there are cases where things are abundant while the form remains unnourished.\nLife necessarily begins with form inseparable—yet there are cases where form remains intact while life perishes.\nLife’s coming cannot be refused; its going cannot be halted.\nHow lamentable!\n\nThe world believes that nourishing the form suffices to preserve life—yet if nourishing the form truly does not suffice to preserve life, then what in this world is worth doing?\nThough it may not suffice, one cannot but do it—such is the inescapable burden.\nOne cannot escape having form.\n\nTo escape the burden of form, nothing surpasses abandoning the world.\nAbandoning the world means freedom from entanglements; freedom from entanglements means true equilibrium; true equilibrium means alternating renewal with that which gives life.\n*That*—the Creator.\nThe Creator gives me life, which must end in death—yet if I can preserve this life, I alternate renewal with the Creator.\nIn such alternation lies the subtlest essence.\n\nWhy abandon affairs? Why forsake life?\nAbandoning affairs spares the form from labor; forsaking life preserves the essence from depletion.\nWhen form is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven.\nHeaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things:\nUnited, they form a body; dispersed, they become a beginning.\nWhen form and essence remain undiminished, this is called *shifting*.\nEssence refined to its utmost returns to assist Heaven.\n*Heaven*—here rhyming with *tian*.\n*Shifting*—referring to the \"alternation\" above.\nThis means one can alternate with it.\n\nLife originally possesses this essence, yet worldly affairs nearly exhaust it.\nNow, by alternating renewal, one regains this essence—what gave me this life was Heaven.\nIf I, in turn, can preserve this life with Heaven, this is *assisting Heaven*.\n\nZi Liezi asked Guan Yin: \"The perfected person walks underwater without obstruction, treads fire without heat, moves above the myriad things without fear. How does one reach such a state?\"\nGuan Yin replied: \"This is the preservation of pure *qi*, not the realm of cunning, skill, or boldness. Sit, and I will tell you:\nAll things with appearance, form, sound, or color are merely *things*—how can one thing surpass another?\nWhat suffices to transcend them? Only *formlessness*.\nFormlessness is the origin of creation and the end of transformation.\nOne who attains this and exhausts it—how can mere things constrain them?\nThey dwell within the measure of restraint, conceal themselves in the traceless principle, and roam through the beginning and end of the myriad things.\nUnifying their nature, nurturing their *qi*, harmonizing their virtue, they commune with the source of all things.\nSuch a one’s Heavenly endowment remains whole, their spirit unbroken—how could things intrude?\n\nThe drunken man who falls from a cart, though swiftly, does not die.\nHis bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit remains whole.\nHe neither knows he is riding nor knows he has fallen; life and death, terror and dread do not enter his breast.\nThus, though he collides with things, he is not afraid.\nIf one preserved by wine can be thus, how much more one preserved by Heaven?\nThe sage hides within Heaven—thus nothing can harm them.\n\nThe avenger does not break the sword’s edge;\nEven one with a vengeful heart does not resent a fallen tile—thus the world attains balance.\nTherefore, there are no wars of conquest, no punishments of slaughter—this is the Way’s doing.\nDo not open the Heavenly in man, but open the Heavenly of Heaven.\nOpening Heaven’s Heaven gives birth to virtue; opening man’s Heaven harms life.\nDo not reject one’s Heavenly nature, nor neglect the human—then the people approach their true essence.\"\n\nConfucius traveled to Chu and, passing through a forest, saw a hunchbacked man catching cicadas as if plucking them.\nConfucius said: \"You are skillful—do you have a method?\"\nThe man replied: \"I do. After five or six months of stacking pellets without dropping them, I lose only a fraction; with three pellets, I lose one in ten; with five, it is as if plucking them.\nWhen I steady my body, it is like a withered stump; when I extend my arm, it is like a dead branch.\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast and the myriad things many, I am aware only of the cicada’s wings.\nI do not turn aside, nor do I let the myriad things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail?\"\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said: \"Where intent is undivided, it approaches the divine.\"\n*(The Shu edition reads \"approaches\" (*yi*), and below it says: \"The vessel’s divinity lies in its concentration (*ning*)—is this not the hunchbacked elder’s meaning?\")*\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"Once, when I crossed the deep rapids of Shang, the ferryman handled the boat as if by magic. I asked him: ‘Can one learn to handle a boat?’ He said: ‘Yes. A skilled swimmer can learn quickly. As for those who dive and excel in the depths—even if they’ve never seen a boat, they can handle it immediately.’ I asked him, but he did not explain. May I ask what this means?\"\nConfucius said: \"A skilled swimmer can learn quickly because they have forgotten the water. As for those who dive and excel in the depths—even if they’ve never seen a boat, they can handle it immediately because to them, deep pools are like hills, and a capsized boat is like a cart rolling backward.\nTen thousand dangers may lie before them, yet none enter their dwelling—where could they not be at ease?\nOne who stakes tiles in a game plays skillfully; one who stakes hooks hesitates; one who stakes gold grows confused.\nTheir skill is the same, yet when they fixate on the stake, they value externals.\nAll who value externals are clumsy within.\n*(Here, the text shifts from the heart to the finger.)*\"\n\nField Kai met Duke Wei of Zhou, who said: \"I have heard that Zhu Shen studied the art of life-nurturing. You, sir, have traveled with Zhu Shen—what have you learned from him?\"\n\nField Kai replied: \"I merely wield broom and dustpan to tend the gates and courtyards. What could I have learned from the Master?\"\n\nDuke Wei said: \"Do not decline, Master Tian. I wish to hear it.\"\n\nKai said: \"I heard the Master say: 'One who nurtures life well is like a shepherd herding sheep—he watches those lagging behind and whips them.'\"\n\nDuke Wei asked: \"What does this mean?\"\n\nField Kai said: \"In Lu there was Shan Bao, who dwelled in the cliffs and drank from streams, sharing no profit with the people. At seventy, his complexion remained like a child’s. Unluckily, he met a starving tiger, which killed and devoured him. There was also Zhang Yi, who frequented every high gate and thin curtain, running wherever he was called. At forty, he died of internal heat-illness. Bao nurtured his inner self, yet the tiger consumed his outer; Yi nurtured his outer self, yet illness attacked his inner. These two men both failed to whip the laggards.\n\nWhen sheep have already moved forward, they need no whip. Only those falling behind require it—this illustrates that one who has already nurtured the inner need not labor further within, but should tend the outer; one who has already nurtured the outer need not labor further without, but should tend the inner.\n\nConfucius said: 'Do not withdraw to hide, do not emerge to display, stand like firewood in the center.' If these three are attained, one’s name will surely reach its peak. 'Stand like firewood' means to stand like withered wood. 'Stand like firewood in the center' means neither to emerge nor withdraw.\n\nThose who fear the roads—if one in ten is killed, fathers and sons, brothers and kin will warn one another, mustering armed retinues before daring to venture out. Is this not wisdom? Yet what people truly should fear lies in their bedding and at their meals, yet they fail to guard against it—this is their error.\n\nThe sacrificial officer, clad in dark robes, approaches the pen to address the pig, saying: 'Why do you hate death? I will fatten you for three months, purify you for ten days, fast for three, spread white couch-grass, and place your shoulder and rump upon the carved platter—would you accept this?' For the pig’s sake, he would say: 'Better to eat chaff and糟 and be left in the pen.' For his own sake, he would accept a life of noble carriages and caps, and a death upon painted shields and among heaped boughs. For the pig, he rejects it; for himself, he accepts it—how does he differ from the pig?\n\nPainted shields bear the design of pheasant feathers. Heaped boughs are woven mats for gathering things.\n\nDuke Huan was hunting in Fa Marsh, with Guan Zhong driving his chariot, when he saw a ghost. The Duke grasped Guan Zhong’s hand and asked: 'What do you see, Father Zhong?'\n\nHe replied: 'Your servant sees nothing.'\"\n\nDuke Huan returned, choked with rage and fell ill, repeatedly refusing to leave his chamber. Among the Qi scholars was one named Huangzi Gao’ao, who said: \"The Duke has harmed himself; how could a ghost harm him? When the qi of pent-up fury scatters and fails to return, it leads to deficiency. If it rises but does not descend, it makes one prone to anger. If it sinks but does not ascend, it makes one prone to forgetfulness. If it departs the center and lodges in the heart, it causes illness.\"\n\nDuke Huan asked: \"Then do ghosts exist?\"\nHe replied: \"They do. In the depths lurks *Lü*. The hearth harbors *Ji*. In the dusty corners within doors, *Leiting* dwells. Beneath the northeast lies *Bei’e*, where *Xielong* and *Longyue* leap. Beneath the northwest, *Yiyang* resides. In waters abides *Wangxiang*; in mounds, *Shanxin*; in mountains, *Kui*; in the wilds, *Panghuang*; in marshes, *Weiyi*.\"\n\nThe Duke asked: \"What is the form of *Weiyi* like?\"\nHuangzi said: \"*Weiyi* is as large as a wheel hub, as long as a chariot shaft, clad in purple robes and a vermilion cap. As a creature, it is fearsome—when it hears the rumble of thunder-chariots, it clasps its head and stands upright. Whoever sees it is near to attaining hegemony.\"\n\nDuke Huan burst into laughter and said: \"This is what I saw!\" Thereupon, he straightened his robes and cap, sat with Huangzi, and before the day was out, his illness had vanished.\n\n---\n\nJingshengzi reared fighting cocks for the king. After ten days, the king asked: \"Are the cocks ready?\"\nHe replied: \"Not yet. They are still hollow and arrogant, relying on their qi.\"\nAfter another ten days, the king asked again.\nHe replied: \"Not yet. They still react to shadows and echoes.\"\nAfter another ten days, the king asked again.\nHe replied: \"Not yet. They still glare fiercely and bristle with qi.\"\nAfter another ten days, the king asked again.\nHe said: \"Nearly so. Though other cocks may crow, these remain unchanged—from a distance, they seem like wooden cocks. Their virtue is complete. No other cock dares respond; they turn and flee.\"\n\nConfucius observed the Lü Liang falls, where the water plunged from a height of thirty *ren*, its rapids surging for forty *li*, a place where even soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and thought he must be in distress, seeking death. He sent his disciples to follow the current and rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, his hair unbound, walking and singing as he strolled beneath the embankment. Confucius followed and questioned him, saying: \"I took you for a ghost, but upon closer inspection, you are a man. May I ask if there is a Dao to treading water?\"\n\nThe man replied: \"I have no Dao. I began with what was familiar, grew with my nature, and completed it through fate. I enter with the swirl and emerge with the surge, following the water’s Way without imposing my own will. This is how I tread it.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"What do you mean by beginning with what was familiar, growing with your nature, and completing it through fate?\"\n\nThe man replied: \"I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—this is what is familiar. I grew up in the water and am at ease in the water—this is my nature. I do not know why I am as I am, yet I am so—this is fate.\"\n\n*Qi* (齐) is read as *navel*; as in the *Zuozhuan*, where \"噬齐\" is also written as \"齐,\" referring to the swirling water’s entry point resembling a navel, while *gǔ* (汩) is where the water surges forth.\n\nZiqing carved wood into a *jù*, and when it was finished, those who saw it marveled as if it were the work of ghosts or spirits. The Lord of Lu saw it and asked him: \"What technique did you use to create this?\"\n\nThe craftsman replied: \"I am but a workman—what technique could I possess? Yet there is one thing: when I set out to carve a *jù*, I never dare to waste my *qi*. I must fast in purity and still my mind. After three days of fasting, I no longer dare entertain thoughts of rewards, ranks, or emoluments. After five days, I no longer dare entertain thoughts of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness. After seven days, I suddenly forget I have limbs or a body. At that moment, there is no court or state. My skill becomes whole, and all external distractions dissolve. Only then do I enter the mountain forests to observe the natural forms of trees, waiting until the perfect *jù* appears before me—only then do I set my hand to it. Otherwise, I stop. Thus, I unite Heaven with Heaven. This is why the finished vessel seems the work of spirits.\"\n\n*A jù* is the frame that holds bells and drums.\n\nDongye Ji presented his charioteering to Duke Zhuang. He advanced and retreated in perfect alignment with the marking line, turned left and right in perfect arcs as if drawn by a compass. The Duke believed no painted pattern could surpass it. He ordered Ji to drive a hundred intricate loops and return. Yan He encountered him and entered to say: \"Ji’s horses will fail.\" The Duke kept this private, not wishing to make it known.\n\nThe master craftsman Chui could turn his hand to match compass and square, yet it was not by calculation. Soon after, the chariot indeed failed and returned. The Duke asked, \"How did you know?\" He replied: \"His horses’ strength was exhausted, yet he still demanded more—thus I said they would fail.\"\n\nTo turn the hand and naturally match compass and square means to transform with things without the mind’s interference. Thus, his spirit-terrace remains unified and unshackled, forgetting the comfort of feet and sandals, the fit of waistband and sash, the rightness of knowledge and judgment, the mind’s ease. Neither inwardly altered nor outwardly swayed, he meets events with perfect accord. From the first step of ease, he never departs from ease—this is the ease of forgetting ease.\n\nThere was a man named Sun Xiu who came to Master Bian Qingzi’s door and exclaimed: \"Though I dwell in my village, none call me unrefined; though I face peril, none call me cowardly. Yet when I till the fields, the years do not favor me; when I serve a lord, the age does not favor me. Cast out by my village, driven from my district—what offense have I given Heaven? Why has fate treated me thus?\" Master Bian replied: \"Have you not heard of the Perfect Man’s way of conduct? He forgets his liver and gall, leaves behind his ears and eyes, wanders in boundless vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roams freely in the work of no-occupation—this is called acting without reliance, leading without domination. Now you adorn your knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate your person to expose others’ flaws, and stride forth as if bearing the sun and moon. You have preserved your bodily form intact, kept all nine orifices whole, and avoided midway afflictions like deafness, blindness, lameness, or deformity to be counted among men—you are already fortunate. Why then do you have leisure to complain of Heaven’s injustice? Begone!\"\n\nSun Xiu departed, and Master Bian entered.\n\nAfter a while, he sat gazing upward and sighed. A disciple asked: \"Master, why do you sigh?\"\n\nMaster Bian replied: \"Just now, Sun Xiu came, and I spoke to him of the Perfect Man’s virtue. I fear he was startled and may fall into confusion.\"\n\nThe disciple said: \"Not so. If Sun Xiu’s words were right and yours wrong, he would not be confused by what is right. If Sun Xiu’s words were wrong and yours right, he was already confused when he came—what fault is that of yours?\"\n\nMaster Bian said: \"Not so. Once there was a bird that alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu delighted in it, prepared a grand feast to entertain it, and performed the *Nine Shao* to please it. The bird grew anxious, sorrowful, and dizzy, and dared not eat or drink. This is called nourishing a bird with what nourishes oneself. As for nourishing a bird as a bird ought to be nourished, one should let it roost in deep forests, drift upon rivers and lakes, feed on whatever it encounters, and rest on level ground. Now Sun Xiu is a man of narrow understanding and scant knowledge. When I spoke to him of the Perfect Man’s virtue, it was like burdening a field mouse with chariots and horses, or delighting a sparrow with bells and drums—how could he not be startled?\"*\n\n*Kuan* means \"small opening\"; *qi* means \"to open.\" *Kuanqi* describes one of limited vision.\n\n*The Southern Florescence True Scripture, Following the Original Text, Chapter Eighteen, ends here.* #1 The character 是 was emended to 视 in accordance with the received text.\n\n*The Southern Florescence True Scripture, Following the Original Text, Chapter Nineteen. Collated by Peng Xiang, disciple of Lu Lingzhufeng’s lineage under Luo Miandao.*\n\n**Outer Chapters: The Mountain Tree**\n\nWhen Master Zhuang was traveling through the mountains, he saw a great tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. Asking the reason, he was told, \"It is of no use.\" Master Zhuang said, \"This tree, by being useless, has lived out its natural span.\"\n\nEmerging from the mountains, he lodged at the house of an old friend. The friend, delighted, ordered a servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked, \"One can caw, the other cannot— which should we kill?\" The host replied, \"Kill the one that cannot caw.\"\n\nThe next day, a disciple asked Master Zhuang, \"Yesterday, the tree in the mountains lived out its natural span by being useless; today, the host’s goose died for being useless. Where will you, Master, take your stand?\" Master Zhuang laughed and said, \"I will stand between usefulness and uselessness. Yet between usefulness and uselessness—though it seems so—it is not so, and thus one is not free from entanglement. But if one rides the Dao and floats upon virtue, it is otherwise: neither praised nor blamed, now dragon, now serpent, transforming with the times, never clinging to one form. Rising and falling, taking harmony as measure, drifting upon the ancestor of the ten thousand things. Treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by them—how then could one be entangled? This is the method of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor.\n\nAs for the nature of the ten thousand things and the transmission of human relations, it is not so. Union leads to separation, completion to ruin, sharpness to blunting, honor to slander, action to loss, worthiness to schemes, unworthiness to deceit. How can one be certain of anything? Alas! Remember this, disciples: it is only in the realm of Dao and virtue.\n\nThe worthy exhaust their minds scheming over affairs, while petty men turn to cunning and deceit.\n\nJiananyi of Shinan visited the Lord of Lu, who wore a troubled expression. Jiananyi asked, \"My lord, why this troubled look?\" The Lord of Lu replied, \"I study the Way of the former kings, cultivate the undertakings of my predecessors; I revere ghosts and honor the worthy; I practice this without the slightest lapse. Yet I cannot escape misfortune—this is why I am troubled.\"\n\nJiananyi said, \"My lord’s method of avoiding misfortune is shallow. The sleek fox and the patterned leopard dwell in the mountains and forests, crouch in caves and cliffs—this is stillness. They move by night and rest by day—this is vigilance. Though hungry and thirsty, in straitened circumstances, they still keep their distance upon the rivers and lakes while seeking food—this is steadfastness. Yet they cannot escape the calamity of nets and traps. What crime have they committed? Their skins bring disaster upon them. Is not the state of Lu your lordship’s skin? I wish you would carve away your form, shed your skin, wash your heart, cast off desire, and wander in the wilds where no man dwells.\"\n\n*Xu* means \"to assist\"; *shu* means \"to distance.\" Though hungry and thirsty, in straitened circumstances, they still keep their distance upon the rivers and lakes while seeking food—this means they remain in the mountains and forests, refusing to venture upon the rivers and lakes to seek food.\n\nIn the southern lands there is a city called the State of Establishing Virtue. Its people are simple and guileless, with few private interests and scant desires. They know how to work but not how to hoard; they give without seeking repayment. They do not know where duty leads, nor where ritual is headed.\n\nThe reckless and wayward tread the great square of the Dao. Their lives may be joyful, their deaths may be buried. I wish you would abandon your state, cast off custom, and walk in mutual support with the Way.\n\nYou say: \"That Way is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what then?\"\nMaster South-of-Market replies: \"Do not cling to form or pride, do not linger in one place, and take this as your carriage.\"\n\nYou say: \"That Way is secluded and remote, with no one there—with whom shall I be neighbors? I have no provisions, no food—how can I reach it?\"\nMaster South-of-Market replies: \"Reduce your expenses, diminish your desires, and though you have no grain, you will find sufficiency. Cross the river and float upon the sea; gaze upon it and you will not see its shore. The farther you go, the less you will know its end. Those who see you off will turn back from the shore—from then on, you will be far away.\"\n\nFrom the State of Establishing Virtue in the south to this point, later generations have interpolated these words, crude and shallow, surely not the authentic voice of Zhuangzi.\n\nThus, to possess others is a burden; to be possessed by others is a sorrow. Therefore, Yao neither possessed others nor was possessed by them. I wish to relieve you of your burdens, remove your sorrows, and wander alone with the Way in the boundless realm.\n\nWhen a double-hulled boat crosses a river, an empty boat drifts into it—even a man of narrow heart would not grow angry. But if there were a man aboard, he would shout to steer it away. If the first shout goes unheard, he shouts again; if still unheard, he curses in anger. Before, he was not angry, but now he is—before, the boat was empty, but now it is full. If a man can empty himself and wander through the world, who can harm him?\n\nWhen Beigong She levied taxes for Duke Ling of Wei to cast bells, he built an altar outside the outer gate of the capital. In three months, the upper and lower chimes were complete. Prince Qingji saw this and asked: \"What method did you employ?\"\nShe replied: \"In the space of unity, I dared not impose any method. I have heard: after carving and polishing, return to simplicity. Vast and unknowing, drifting and hesitant, like plants growing wild and without intent—sending off the departing, welcoming the arriving. Let those who come not be barred, let those who go not be stopped. Follow the strong and unyielding, adapt to the crooked and compliant, and let them reach their own end. Thus, though taxes were levied day and night, not a hair was harmed—how much more so for those who tread the great path?\"\n\nThe Way is one alone; if you act with purpose, you divide it into two. Thus, in the space of unity, I dared not impose any method.\n\nVast and unknowing, drifting and without intent, like plants growing wild—this is the appearance of having no mind. The strong and unyielding are those who do not follow; those who are crooked and compliant simply follow their nature. To \"let them reach their own end\" means to accept what comes of itself. \"Not harmed\" means not diminished. The \"great path\" is the great Way. If even tax collection can be so, how much more so governing the world by the great Way?\n\nConfucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Taigong Ren went to console him, asking: \"Are you near death?\"\n\"Yes,\" Confucius replied.\n\"Do you hate death?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\nTaigong Ren said: \"Let me speak to you of the way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea there is a bird called *Yidai*. As a bird, it is slow and sluggish, appearing incapable. It flies only when supported, perches only when pressed. It does not dare to advance first or retreat last; it does not dare to eat before others, but must take the leftovers. Thus, it is never driven from the flock, and others never harm it—so it escapes misfortune. The straight tree is the first felled; the sweet well is the first drained. You, I fear, adorn your knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate yourself to expose the corrupt, shining brightly like one who carries the sun and moon in procession—how could you escape harm?\n\nLong ago, I heard from a man of great completion: 'Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit; those who achieve merit fall; those who achieve fame lose it. Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the common people?' The Way flows but does not dwell in fame; it acts but does not claim a place. Pure and constant, it is like one who is mad, erasing traces and diminishing attachments, not seeking merit or fame. Thus, it demands nothing of others, and others demand nothing of it. The perfected person does not strive—why do you delight in this?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Excellent!\" He then parted from his friends and disciples, fled to the great marsh, wore coarse cloth and furs, ate acorns and chestnuts, and entered among beasts without disturbing their herds, among birds without disrupting their flocks. Birds and beasts did not shun him—how much less would men?\n\nConfucius asked Zisang Hu: \"I was twice banished from Lu, had a tree felled in Song, was forced to erase my tracks in Wei, was impoverished in Shang and Zhou, and besieged between Chen and Cai. I have suffered these many misfortunes, my close friends growing more distant, my followers scattering—why is this?\"\n\nZisang Hu replied: \"Have you not heard of the escape of the man from Jia? Jia was a man who relied on others to flee. Lin Hui abandoned a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a baby on his back and run. Someone asked: 'Was it for the sake of its value? The baby’s value is slight. Was it for the burden? The baby’s burden is great. Why abandon a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a baby and run?' Lin Hui said: 'That was bound by profit; this is bound by heaven. Those bound by profit abandon each other in straitened circumstances, misfortune, and harm; those bound by heaven gather together in straitened circumstances, misfortune, and harm. The difference between gathering and abandoning is vast. Moreover, the friendship of a gentleman is as bland as water; the friendship of a petty man is as sweet as wine. The gentleman’s blandness brings closeness; the petty man’s sweetness brings estrangement. Those who come together without cause will part without cause.'\"\n\nConfucius said: \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\" He then walked slowly and leisurely home, abandoned his studies, discarded his books, and his disciples no longer vied for his attention before him—yet their love for him grew deeper.\n\nAnother day, Zisang Hu said: \"When Shun was about to die, he earnestly warned Yu: 'Be vigilant!'\"\n\nShape should follow its natural course; emotions should follow their true nature. Following the natural course prevents separation; following true nature prevents exhaustion. Without separation or exhaustion, one does not seek adornment to match form. Thus, one does not depend on external things.\n\nZhenling Yu is a person’s name, and \"you\" refers to Shun.\n\nZhuangzi wore coarse cloth patched with hemp, tied his shoes with rough cords, and passed by King Wei. The king said: \"Why is the Master so weary?\" Zhuangzi replied: \"It is poverty, not weariness. A scholar who possesses the Dao and virtue yet cannot put them into practice—that is weariness. Worn-out clothes and tattered shoes are poverty, not weariness. This is what is called not encountering the right time. Has Your Majesty never seen the leaping monkeys? When they find themselves among nanmu, catalpa, and camphor trees, they grasp the vines and swing through the branches, reigning supreme—even Yi or Feng Meng could not take aim at them. Yet when they find themselves among thorn bushes, brambles, and jujube thickets, they move cautiously, glancing about in fear, trembling with dread. This is not because their sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened, but because their position is unfavorable, and they cannot fully display their abilities. Now, living amid a benighted ruler and chaotic ministers, how can one avoid weariness? This is like the fate of Bi Gan, whose heart was cut out as proof!\"\n\n*Zhengxi* means to straighten one’s sash.\n\nConfucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Leaning on a withered tree, he struck its dry branches and sang the airs of the *Yan* clan. There was the form of the music but not its precise structure, the sound but not its proper notes. The sound of the wood and the human voice blended like a plow turning the soil—loose and free—yet it resonated with the hearts of others. Yan Hui stood with folded hands, turning his gaze to observe. Fearing that Yan Hui might overreach in his admiration or grow sorrowful out of affection, Confucius said: \"Hui, it is easy to accept what heaven diminishes, but difficult to accept what others bestow. There is no beginning that is not also an end—humanity and heaven are one. Who is it that sings now?\"\n\nYan Hui said: \"May I ask why it is easy to accept what heaven diminishes?\" Confucius replied: \"Hunger, thirst, cold, and heat—when one is trapped and cannot move—are the workings of heaven and earth, the outflow of the movement of things. To speak of going along with them is to say one moves with them. As a minister, one does not dare to depart from this. If even the way of serving a ruler is like this, how much more so the way of awaiting heaven? Hunger, thirst, cold, and heat—when one is trapped and cannot move—are the flowing of heaven and earth’s *qi*, the movement and release of the myriad things, which cannot be stopped. To wish to avoid this, one would have to halt the *qi* of heaven and earth—one can only go along with it. A minister regards his ruler as heaven and earth; he must simply follow.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by it being difficult to accept what others bestow?\" Confucius said: \"At the outset, one’s path opens in all four directions, and ranks and emoluments arrive without end. What others find beneficial is not one’s own—one’s fate lies beyond such things. When one first gains employment, there are no obstacles. Ranks and emoluments may be grand and not without appeal, but one exhausts oneself in service only to benefit others—what does it have to do with oneself? One’s fate lies beyond such things. The gentleman does not steal; the worthy does not pilfer. What would I take from them? Thus it is said: No bird is wiser than the swallow. Where its eyes should not linger, it does not glance; even if its eggs fall, it abandons them and flees. Though it fears humans, it nests among them—only for the sake of the altars of soil and grain.\n\n*The swallow* is the swallow. *Does not glance* means it has no time. *Eggs* refers to its brood. *Altars of soil and grain* refers to the spring and autumn sacrifices to the gods of soil and grain. The swallow does not linger where it should not nest in human dwellings; even if its eggs fall, it abandons them without a backward glance. The reason is its fear of humans. Its nesting among humans only occurs during the sacrifices to the altars of soil and grain. Swallows come at the spring sacrifice and depart at the autumn sacrifice. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: 'Without bells and drums, it is called *stealth*.' This is merely a passing remark, yet commentators have made it needlessly abstruse and laughable—there are many such cases.\n\n\"What do you mean by 'there is no beginning that is not also an end'?\" Confucius said: \"When the myriad things transform, one does not know who succeeds them—how can one know their end? How can one know their beginning? One simply aligns with them and awaits.\"\n\n\"What does it mean for humans and Heaven to be one?\" Confucius said: \"Where there is humanity, there is Heaven; where there is Heaven, there is also Heaven. That humans cannot possess Heaven is their nature. The sage, at ease, embodies the passing and comes to an end. In all matters beyond human capacity, whatever humans accomplish is Heaven. And what Heaven accomplishes is also Heaven. That humans cannot possess themselves is simply the spontaneity of Heavenly nature. Only the sage is one with Heaven—at ease, embodying the passing, calmly allowing body and self to pass away together.\"\n\nZhuang Zhou wandered near the fence of Carved Mound and saw an unusual magpie coming from the south. Its wings spanned seven feet in breadth, its eyes measured an inch in circumference. It brushed against Zhou’s forehead in flight, descended, and alighted in a chestnut grove. Zhuang Zhou said: \"What bird is this? Its wings are vast yet it does not fly far; its eyes are large yet it does not see clearly.\" He tucked up his robe, strode forward, took up his sling, and waited. He saw a cicada enjoying the fine shade and forgetting its own form. A mantis, seizing the opportunity, struck at it, seeing only its gain and forgetting its own shape. The unusual magpie, drawn by profit, seized the chance, seeing only the advantage and forgetting its true nature. Zhuang Zhou, startled, said: \"Alas! Things indeed entangle one another—two kinds summon each other.\" He cast aside his sling and turned to flee, but the gamekeeper pursued him with shouts and curses.\n\nZhuang Zhou returned home and for three months did not step into the courtyard. Lan Ju approached and asked: \"Master, why have you been so withdrawn lately?\" Zhuang Zhou replied: \"I guarded my form and forgot my self; I gazed upon muddy waters and became lost in clear depths. Moreover, I have heard from my master: 'Enter their customs, follow their customs.' Now I wandered in Carved Mound and forgot my self; the unusual magpie brushed my forehead, and I wandered in the chestnut grove and forgot my true nature. The gamekeeper of the chestnut grove took me for a disgrace—this is why I have withdrawn.\"\n\nYang Zi traveled to Song and lodged at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines—one beautiful, the other ugly. The ugly one was honored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yang Zi asked the reason, and the innkeeper’s servant replied: \"The beautiful one is self-aware of her beauty, so I do not recognize her beauty; the ugly one is self-aware of her ugliness, so I do not recognize her ugliness.\" Yang Zi said: \"Disciples, take note: act with virtue and abandon the conduct of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be loved? One should simply practice virtuous deeds—then how could one fail to be loved by others?\"\n\n*The Nanhua True Classic, Following the Original Text, Chapter Nineteen Concludes*\n*The Nanhua True Classic, Following the Original Text, Chapter Twenty*\n\nLúlíng’s Bamboo Peak, recorded by Luó Miǎndào, collated by disciple Péng Xiáng\n\n**External Chapters: Tián Zǐfāng**\n\nTián Zǐfāng attended upon Marquis Wén of Wèi and repeatedly praised Xī Gōng. The Marquis said: \"Xī Gōng—is he your teacher?\" Zǐfāng replied: \"No. He is but a villager of Wúzé. His praises were so apt that Wúzé could not but speak of him.\" The Marquis said: \"Then do you have no teacher?\" Zǐfāng said: \"I do.\" The Marquis asked: \"Who is your teacher?\" Zǐfāng said: \"Dōngguō Shùnzǐ.\" The Marquis said: \"Then why have you never spoken of him?\" Zǐfāng said: \"His way of being is true. His appearance is human, yet his nature is of Heaven; he follows things while preserving his authenticity; he is pure yet embraces all. Though he bears a human form, he accords with Heaven’s spontaneity; though empty, he follows things while guarding his truth; though clear, he contains all things. When beings lack the Dao, he meets them with upright bearing to awaken them, dissolving their intentions. When confronted with perversity, he simply rectifies what lies within himself, and their resistance melts away. How could Wúzé be worthy of speaking of him?\"\n\nZǐfāng departed. The Marquis, lost in thought, remained silent the whole day. Summoning the ministers who stood before him, he said: \"Far indeed is the gentleman of perfect virtue! At first, I thought the words of sagely wisdom and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness were the ultimate. But when I heard of Zǐfāng’s teacher, my form dissolved and I had no desire to move; my mouth was sealed and I had no desire to speak. What I have learned is but a clay figurine. Truly, Wèi has been a burden to me.\"\n\nWēnbó Xuězǐ traveled to Qí and lodged in Lǔ. A man of Lǔ requested an audience with him. Wēnbó Xuězǐ said: \"I cannot. I have heard that the gentlemen of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. I do not wish to meet him.\" When he arrived in Qí and returned to lodge in Lǔ, the same man again requested an audience. Wēnbó Xuězǐ said: \"Before, he sought to see me; now, he seeks to see me again—he must have some inspiration to stir me.\" He went out to meet the guest, then returned and sighed. The next day, he met the guest again and returned, sighing once more. His servant said: \"Every time you meet this guest, you return and sigh. Why?\" He replied: \"I told you before: the people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. The one who saw me earlier advanced and retreated like a compass or square, moved with the composure of a dragon or tiger. When he admonished me, it was like a son; when he guided me, it was like a father. That is why I sighed.\"\n\nConfucius met him and did not speak. Zǐlù said: \"Master, you have long wished to see Wēnbó Xuězǐ. Now that you have met him, you do not speak. Why?\" Confucius said: \"In such a man, the Dao is present at a glance—how could words contain it? The Dao is present the moment one’s gaze falls upon him; there is no need for careful examination.\"\n\nYán Yuān asked Confucius: \"When the Master walks, I walk; when the Master hurries, I hurry; when the Master runs, I run; when the Master dashes away, leaving no trace of dust, I can only stare blankly behind.\" Confucius said: \"Yuān, what do you mean?\" He replied: \"When the Master walks, I walk; when the Master hurries, I hurry; when the Master debates, I debate; when the Master runs, I run; when the Master speaks of the Dao, I speak of the Dao. Yet when you dash away, leaving no trace of dust, I can only stare blankly behind. For the Master speaks without needing to establish trust, unites without needing to form bonds, and though without instruments, the people gather before you—yet I do not know why.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Alas! How can you not examine this? There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart, and the death of the body is secondary to it. The sun rises in the east and sets in the westernmost reaches; all things follow its pattern. Those with eyes and feet depend on it to complete their tasks. When it rises, they exist; when it sets, they perish. All things are thus: some depend on it to die, some depend on it to live. Once I received this completed form, I did not change but awaited its end. I move in response to things, day and night without pause, not knowing where it will end. My form was completed as if by the steaming of qi, and even knowing fate, I cannot plan for what lies ahead. I have followed this path daily. My whole life, I have extended my arm to you, yet you have lost it—is this not sorrowful? I grieve for you, Yuān. You cling to what I cling to. He has already exhausted it, yet you seek it as if it still exists—this is like searching for something in an abandoned marketplace. What I wear, you forget; what you wear, I also forget. Yet why should you worry? Though you forget the old me, there is something in me that cannot be forgotten.\"\n\n\"Staring blankly behind\" means gazing straight ahead yet unable to catch up. \"Though without instruments, the people gather before you\" means that without tools to stir the people, they dance before you of their own accord. Yán Yuān did not understand why, so Confucius said: \"Alas! How can you not examine this?\" The reason he did not understand was that he had fixed his heart upon death. Thus, he used the sun as a metaphor: all things follow the sun’s rising and setting in their work and rest, and their life and death likewise depend on it. Confucius merely moved in response to things, flowing with them without cease, accepting his completed form without discussing fate, simply proceeding day by day. \"As if by steaming\" means as if formed by the steaming of qi. My whole life, I have been with you as if I had no conduct apart from the others, yet you have taken what I showed you daily as unattainable. This is like never having clasped arms, only extending one arm before losing it—how could it not be sorrowful? What you spoke of was merely the timely, what you saw of me was only what could be seen. \"Clinging\" means seeing.\n\nHe refers to the Master as \"that one.\" That one has already attained perfect purity and emptiness, yet you seek in him what is substantial—like searching for a horse in a market stall. A market stall is indeed a place where horses are sold, but how could it always have horses?\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says, \"In the central courtyard, there is a cry.\" The annotation explains: \"The central courtyard is the path in the middle of the courtyard, a place for selling horses, with a path to facilitate their entry and exit.\" The *Book of Han* records: \"West of the Jianzhang Palace, there was a central courtyard spanning dozens of *li*.\" Yang Xiong’s *Preface to the ‘Feathered Hunt’* states: \"Sweet dew drips in the courtyard, sweet springs flow in the central path.\" Ban Gu’s *Rhapsody on the Western Capital* says: \"Before the central courtyard, the great pool is dredged.\"\n\n\"Péi-fú\" means to admire and follow. I admire your words, just as you admire mine—both should be utterly forgotten. Yet I fear Yan Yuan worries he will never attain this. Still, why should you worry? Within forgetting, there remains something unforgotten. What is forgotten is attachment; what remains unforgotten is the utmost truth. Though you forget my old teachings, if you gain something of your own, the unforgotten will still abide.\n\nConfucius visited Lao Dan, who had just washed his hair and was letting it dry, standing still as if not human. Confucius withdrew and waited to the side. After a while, he saw him and said: \"Was I deluded just now? Was it truly so? A moment ago, your form seemed like withered wood, as if you had abandoned things and stood apart from men.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"I let my heart wander in the beginning of things.\"\n\nConfucius asked: \"What do you mean?\"\n\nLao Dan replied: \"My heart was blocked and could not know; my mouth was shut and could not speak.\" (The character *bì* here is read as in \"to ward off evil,\" pronounced *bìyě*. The mouth was as if sealed and could not speak.) \"Yet I have tried to discuss with you what is to come. What is to come is what will be. Let me speak of the beginning of what will be: The utmost yin is solemn and still; the utmost yang blazes and surges. Solemn stillness emerges from heaven; blazing surging arises from earth. The two intermingle, harmonize, and things are born. Some serve as their pattern, yet no form is seen. They ebb and flow, fill and empty, now dark, now bright, changing day by day, month by month, acting without visible achievement. Life has its sprouting; death has its return. Beginning and end turn back without end, yet none know where they cease. If not this, then what is their source?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"May I ask about wandering in this?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"To attain this is the utmost beauty and utmost joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy—this is called the Perfect Man.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"I wish to hear the method.\"\n\nLao Dan replied: \"Herbivorous beasts do not shun swamps; aquatic creatures do not avoid water. Small changes occur without losing their great constancy. Joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness do not enter the breast. The world is where the myriad things are one. If you attain this oneness and become the same, then your four limbs and hundred parts will be but dust and grime, and life and death, beginning and end will be like day and night—nothing can disturb them. How much less could gain and loss, fortune and misfortune affect them? Those who discard servitude do so as if discarding mud and mire, knowing the body is nobler than servitude. Nobility lies within me and does not lose itself in change. Moreover, the myriad transformations have no end—what is there to trouble the heart? Those who have attained the Way understand this. Only those who have personally realized the Way can comprehend it.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Your virtue matches heaven and earth, yet you still borrow the utmost words to cultivate your heart. Of the noble men of old, who could escape this?\"\n\n(Here, *shuō* is read as *tuō*, meaning \"to escape.\")\n\nLao Dan said: \"Not so. Water, when it flows, does nothing yet naturally displays its ability. The Perfect Man, in regard to virtue, does not cultivate it, yet things cannot depart from him. Like heaven’s natural height, earth’s natural depth, the sun and moon’s natural brightness—what cultivation is needed?\"\n\nConfucius left and told Yan Hui: \"In the Way, I am like a vinegar fly. Without the Master’s uncovering of my blindness, I would not have known the great completeness of heaven and earth.\"\n\nZhuangzi visited Duke Ai of Lu. The Duke said: \"In Lu, there are many Confucians, but few who practice your methods.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Lu has few Confucians.\"\n\nThe Duke said: \"The whole state of Lu wears Confucian garb—how can you say there are few?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"I have heard that Confucians wear round caps to know the seasons, square shoes to know the earth’s forms, and jade pendants that sway to decide matters when they arise. Those who possess the Way are not necessarily those who wear its garb; those who wear its garb do not necessarily know the Way. If you truly do not believe this, why not issue a decree throughout the state: 'Those who lack this Way yet wear its garb shall be put to death.'\"\n\nThe Duke issued the decree for five days, and no one in Lu dared wear Confucian garb. Only one man, dressed as a Confucian, stood at the palace gate. The Duke summoned him and questioned him about state affairs. His answers were inexhaustible, shifting a thousand ways without end.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"With the whole state of Lu, there is only one Confucian—can this be called many?\"\n\nBaili Xi did not let rank and salary enter his heart, so when he fed cattle, the cattle grew fat. This made Duke Mu of Qin forget his lowly status and entrust him with governance. The lord of Yu did not let life and death enter his heart, so he could move others.\n\nThe Lord of Song Yuan was about to have paintings made. Many scribes arrived, bowed and stood, licked their brushes and mixed ink—half remained outside. One scribe arrived late, strolled in unhurriedly, bowed but did not stand, and went to his quarters. The Lord sent someone to observe him. He had taken off his clothes and was sitting cross-legged, bare-chested. The Lord said: \"He is the true painter.\"\n\nKing Wen observed at Zang and saw an old man fishing—but his fishing was no fishing. Though he fished, he did not fish. He did not hold his fishing for what could be caught but fished constantly.\n\nKing Wen wished to promote the old fisherman and entrust him with governance, yet feared his great ministers and elders would not accept it. He wished to let the matter rest, yet could not bear the thought of the people being left without a protector. Thus, at dawn, he gathered his ministers and said: \"Last night, I dreamed of a worthy man—dark of complexion, with a beard, riding a piebald horse with one red hoof. He called himself Yu and took charge of governance at Zang. Might this not bring relief to the people?\"\n\nThe ministers, startled, said: \"It was your late father, the former lord.\"\n\nKing Wen said: \"Then let us divine his will.\"\n\nThe ministers replied: \"The command of the former lord requires no further confirmation. What need is there for divination?\"\n\nThereupon, they welcomed the old fisherman of Zang and entrusted him with governance. No laws were altered, no new decrees issued. After three years, King Wen surveyed the realm and found: the ranks of scholars had dissolved their factions and scattered, high officials no longer sought to distinguish themselves, and the grain measures dared not enter the four borders. When the ranks of scholars dissolved their factions and scattered, it showed they valued unity; when high officials no longer sought distinction, it showed they shared a common purpose; when grain measures dared not enter the four borders, it showed the feudal lords harbored no divided loyalties.\n\nKing Wen then made him Grand Preceptor and, facing north, asked: \"Can governance thus extend to all under Heaven?\"\n\nThe old fisherman of Zang remained silent and gave no answer, then vaguely declined and fled by night, never to be heard of again.\n\nTo \"fish with a hook\" is to angle for what can be caught—namely, fish. To \"fish constantly\" is to cast the line habitually without intent to catch. It is not to hold one’s fishing for what can be caught but simply to fish without ceasing.\n\nThe \"former lord\" in King Wen’s dream was his father. \"No new decrees issued\" means he never issued a single command. \"Dissolved their factions\" means they abandoned their established positions and no longer sought to stand apart from others. This account follows the precedent of Lü Wang, yet appears as a separate matter.\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"Was King Wen still not content? Why did he need to dream?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Silence. Say no more. King Wen had already perfected it—what need is there for criticism? He merely followed the momentary impulse. That momentary impulse meant: 'I am worth a hundred of you, or three of you.'\"\n\nLie Yukou shot for Bohun Wuren, drawing the bow to its fullest and placing a cup of water on his elbow. When he loosed the arrow, it met the previous one, and as one arrow flew, another took its place on the string. At that moment, he resembled a wooden figure.\n\nBohun Wuren said: \"This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Let us ascend a high mountain, tread on perilous rocks, and stand above an abyss of a hundred fathoms. Then you may shoot.\"\n\nThereupon, Bohun Wuren climbed the high mountain, trod on perilous rocks, and stood above the abyss. Turning his back, he retreated until two-thirds of his feet hung over the edge, then beckoned Lie Yukou forward. Lie Yukou prostrated himself, sweat streaming to his heels.\n\nBohun Wuren said: \"The perfected man gazes up to the blue sky, plunges down to the Yellow Springs, roams to the eight limits, yet his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with fear in your eyes—you are in grave danger.\"\n\n\"Met the previous arrow\" means the arrow flew and struck the one before it. \"As one arrow flew, another took its place\" means that as one arrow was loosed, the next was already on the string. \"Turning his back, he retreated until two-thirds of his feet hung over the edge\" means he faced the mountain with his back to the abyss, retreating until two-thirds of his feet extended beyond the edge.\n\nShan Wu asked Sunshu Ao: \"You have thrice served as Prime Minister without pride, and thrice been dismissed without sorrow. At first, I doubted you, but now I see your nostrils flare with ease—what is the secret of your heart?\"\n\nSunshu Ao said: \"How do I surpass others? I accept what comes without refusal and let go what departs without hindrance. I regard gain and loss as no concern of mine, and thus remain free of sorrow. How do I surpass others? Moreover, how do I know whether it lies with them or with me? Whether it lies with them and vanishes from me, or with me and vanishes from them? I am still hesitating, still looking around—what leisure have I to consider whether men are noble or base?\"\n\n\"Nostrils flare with ease\" describes his calm breathing as he lies at rest.\n\nConfucius heard of this and said: \"The true men of old could not be swayed by the wise, seduced by the beautiful, robbed by thieves, or befriended by Fuxi or the Yellow Emperor. Life and death are great matters, yet they remained unchanged—how much more so titles and emoluments! Such men’s spirit threads through the great mountains without obstruction, enters the deepest springs without getting wet, dwells in lowliness without weariness, and fills Heaven and Earth. The more they give to others, the more they possess themselves.\"\n\n\"Without obstruction\" means without hindrance.\n\nThe King of Chu sat with the Lord of Fan. After a while, the King’s attendants announced three times that Fan had perished.\n\nThe Lord of Fan said: \"Fan’s perishing does not diminish my existence. If Fan’s perishing does not diminish my existence, then Chu’s existence does not ensure its own existence. From this perspective, Fan has never perished, and Chu has never existed.\"\n\n*The Twenty-First Scroll of the Southern Florescence True Classic (following the original text) ends here.*\n\n*External Chapters: \"Knowledge Wanders North\"*\n*The Twenty-First Scroll of the Southern Florescence True Classic (following the original text)*\n\nLu Lian of Bamboo Peak in Luling, as recorded by his disciple Peng Xiang, collated:\n\n*External Chapters: \"Knowledge Wanders North\"*\n\nKnowledge wandered north to the Dark Waters, ascended Hidden Peak’s Returning Cloud Mound, and there encountered Non-Action’s Discourse.\n\nKnowledge said to Non-Action’s Discourse: \"I wish to ask you: What thoughts, what reflections attain the Dao? What abiding, what practice settle into the Dao? What following, what path obtain the Dao?\"\n\nThree questions, yet Non-Action’s Discourse gave no answer. Not that he refused to answer—he did not know how to answer.\n\nKnowledge, receiving no response, returned south of the White Waters, ascended Fox Tower, and there beheld Mad Qu. Knowledge posed the same questions to Mad Qu.\n\nMad Qu said: \"Alas! I know the answers and would tell you, yet mid-speech I forget what I wished to say.\"\n\nKnowledge, still unanswered, returned to the Imperial Palace and questioned the Yellow Emperor.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"Without thought, without reflection—only then does one attain the Dao. Without abiding, without practice—only then does one settle into the Dao. Without following, without path—only then does one obtain the Dao.\"\n\nKnowledge asked the Yellow Emperor: \"You and I know these answers—pointing to the Yellow Emperor—yet those two—pointing to Non-Action’s Discourse and Mad Qu—do not. Which of you is correct?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"Non-Action’s Discourse is truly right; Mad Qu approaches it; you and I remain far from it. For those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Thus the sage enacts the teaching of no-words. The Dao cannot be attained; virtue cannot be reached. Benevolence may be practiced, righteousness may be diminished, ritual is mutual pretense. Therefore it is said: Lose the Dao, then virtue follows; lose virtue, then benevolence follows; lose benevolence, then righteousness follows; lose righteousness, then ritual follows. Ritual is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of chaos. Therefore it is said: Those who practice the Dao daily diminish, diminishing further and further, until they reach non-action. Through non-action, nothing is left undone. Now that you have already become entangled with things, to return to the root is no easy task. Is it not only the great person who finds it easy?\n\nLife is the companion of death; death is the beginning of life. Who knows their boundary? Human life is the gathering of qi. Gathered, it becomes life; scattered, it becomes death. If death and life are companions, what cause have I for sorrow? Thus the ten thousand things are one. What they deem wondrous is called spirit-like; what they despise is called foul decay. Yet foul decay transforms into spirit-like, and spirit-like transforms into foul decay. Therefore it is said: The world is pervaded by a single qi. Thus the sage values unity.\"\n\nKnowledge said to the Yellow Emperor: \"I asked Non-Action’s Discourse, and he did not respond—not that he refused me, but that he did not know how to respond. I asked Mad Qu, and mid-speech he wished to tell me yet did not—not that he refused me, but that mid-speech he forgot. Now I ask you, and you know the answers. Why, then, are you not close to the truth?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"He is truly right because he does not know. This one approaches it because he forgets. You and I remain far because we know.\"\n\nMad Qu heard this and deemed the Yellow Emperor’s words wise.\n\nHeaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons follow bright patterns yet do not debate; the ten thousand things have completed principles yet do not explain. The sage traces Heaven and Earth’s beauty and comprehends the ten thousand things’ principles. Thus the perfected person does nothing; the great sage does not act—this is called observing Heaven and Earth.\n\nNow, that numinous clarity and utmost essence accompany the hundred transformations. Things die and live, square and round—none know their root. Yet Pien and Pian, though alike, sustain the ten thousand things, which have endured since antiquity. The Six Directions are vast, yet nothing lies beyond their bounds; an autumn hair is small, yet depends on them to form its body. The world knows no constancy, yet all things rise and fall without ceasing. Yin and yang, the four seasons, move in their proper order. Obscurely, they seem absent yet remain; effortlessly, they take no form yet are spirit-like. The ten thousand things nurture and transform, unaware—this is called the root. Through it, one may observe Heaven.\n\nThat numinous clarity and utmost essence reside in the human heart. Yet people cannot observe as the sages do, so Heaven grants them that numinous clarity and utmost essence to accompany the hundred transformations. Thus things die and live, square and round—none know their root, yet the departed are gone, fluttering away without return. The principles of the ten thousand things have always endured; people simply fail to perceive them.\n\nThe Dao has no inside or outside, no small or great. The world is bound within the ebb and flow of growth and decline, ever-renewed and unchanging. The four seasons’ order moves without cease. Those who can be obscurely absent yet present, effortlessly formless yet spirit-like, nurturing the ten thousand things without awareness—only they know the root and may observe Heaven.\n\nNie Que asked the Way of Clothed-in-Skins. Clothed-in-Skins said: \"Straighten your form, unify your gaze—Heaven’s harmony will arrive. Collect your knowledge, unify your measures—spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will adorn you; the Dao will reside within you. Your eyes will be bright as a newborn calf’s, seeking no reason for things.\"\n\nBefore the words were finished, Nie Que fell asleep. Clothed-in-Skins rejoiced greatly, departed singing, and said: \"His form like withered bones, his heart like dead ashes—truly he knows reality, not clinging to the past. Dim and obscure, dark and indistinct, without mind, he cannot be schemed with. What manner of person is he?\"\n\nShun asked Cheng: \"Can the Dao be possessed?\"\n\nCheng said: \"Your body is not your own possession. How could you possess the Dao?\"\n\nShun said: \"If my body is not my own, who possesses it?\"\n\nCheng said: \"It is Heaven and Earth’s entrusted form. Life is not your own—it is Heaven and Earth’s entrusted harmony. Nature and destiny are not your own—they are Heaven and Earth’s entrusted compliance. Children and grandchildren are not your own—they are Heaven and Earth’s entrusted molting. Thus, when you walk, you know not where you go; when you abide, you know not what you hold; when you eat, you know not the taste.\"\n\nThe boundaries of Heaven and Earth are the expanses of yang qi—how could they be possessed?\n\nConfucius asked Lao Dan: \"Today, with leisure and tranquility, I venture to inquire about the supreme Dao.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Purify your mind through fasting, cleanse your spirit, and shatter your knowledge. The Dao is profound and hard to express. Let me speak of its outlines: radiance emerges from obscurity, order arises from formlessness, spirit is born of the Dao, and form originates from essence. All things beget one another through form. Thus, creatures with nine orifices are born from the womb, while those with eight emerge from eggs. Its coming leaves no trace; its going has no boundary. Without gate or chamber, it pervades all four directions in boundless vastness. Those who attain this have strong limbs, penetrating thoughts, keen ears, and sharp eyes. Their minds do not toil, yet they respond to things without fixed method. Heaven cannot but be high, Earth cannot but be broad, sun and moon cannot but move, and all things cannot but flourish—this is the Dao.\n\nMoreover, grasping it does not ensure understanding; debating it does not ensure wisdom. The sage has already settled this. As for that which gains nothing when augmented and loses nothing when diminished, this is what the sage preserves. Deep and still, it is like the sea; towering and vast, it returns to its beginning at the end. It measures and sustains the myriad things without exhaustion—this is the noble one’s Dao, yet it lies beyond them. All things turn to it for sustenance, yet it is never exhausted. This is the Dao.\n\nThere exists a being within the Central Kingdom, neither yin nor yang, dwelling between Heaven and Earth. For now, it is human, but it will return to its origin. Viewed from its root, life is but the shadow of things. Though some live long and others die young, how great is the difference? It is but a moment’s tale—why debate the right and wrong of Yao and Jie? The sage has already determined that one need not grasp or debate it. The sage’s teaching admits no addition or subtraction. Deep and still, it is like the sea; towering and vast, it returns to its beginning at the end—these words praise the sage’s Dao. To measure and sustain the myriad things without exhaustion—this is the noble one’s Dao, yet it lies beyond them. Those who strive to measure and sustain all things are merely pursuing externals. All things turn to it for sustenance, yet it is never exhausted. Is this the Dao? It is not sufficient to be called the Dao.\"\n\nOne in the Central States transcends beyond yin and yang, dwelling between heaven and earth merely as a transient human, soon to return to their origin. That origin is the Great Void. Viewed from the Great Void, human life is but a fleeting shadow. As the *Record of Rites* annotates: \"醷 is plum juice; 喑 means long-fermented.\" Though the juice ferments long, how much time can it truly hold? Those who live many days are called long-lived; those who live few, short-lived. Thus, all that世人 contend over is but a moment’s tale—why debate the right and wrong of Yao and Jie?\n\nFruits and gourds have their principles; though human relationships are complex, they serve to order ranks. The sage encounters them without resistance, passes them without clinging. Harmonizing and responding is virtue; coinciding and responding is the Dao. From this arise emperors and kings.\n\nThough fruits and gourds are humble things, their branches, flowers, and fruits still follow principles. The relationships of ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, friends—though seemingly intricate—serve to order ranks. The sage dwells among these human relationships, meeting them without resistance, never abandoning them; passing them without clinging, never lingering over them. Harmonizing with them and responding is how virtue is enacted; coinciding with them and responding is how the Dao is enacted. The rise of emperors and kings is no different.\n\nHuman life between heaven and earth is like a white colt passing through a gap—gone in an instant. Bursting forth, nothing fails to emerge; flowing smoothly, nothing fails to return. Transformed, one is born; transformed again, one dies. Living things mourn this; humankind grieves it. Loosening the bow-case of heaven, casting off the bonds of fate—tumultuous, winding, the soul departs, and the body follows. Thus, the great return.\n\nThe formless taking form, form dissolving into the formless—this is what all people know, yet it is not what the perfected strive for. This is what the multitude debate. Those who attain it do not debate; those who debate do not attain it. Clear insight finds no encounter; disputation is not as good as silence. The Dao cannot be heard; hearing is not as good as blocking the ears. This is called the Great Attainment.\n\nTumultuous, winding—these describe the loosening of the bow-case and casting off of bonds. \"The formless taking form\" means arising from nothing; \"form dissolving into the formless\" means returning to nothing. *值* means \"to encounter.\" The essence of the Great Dao is that clear insight cannot encounter it—thus, disputation is not as good as silence.\n\nDongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi: \"Where does the so-called Dao reside?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is nowhere absent.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Specify, and then it may be acceptable.\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in the ants.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Why so low?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in the weeds.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Why even lower?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in the tiles.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Why still lower?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in excrement and urine.\"\nDongguo Zi did not respond.\nZhuangzi said: \"Your question fundamentally misses the mark. When Zheng and Huo asked the market inspector about weighing a pig by stepping on it, the lower they went, the clearer the condition became. *期* means to specify. *质* means the root. Your question was vague and did not reach the root, so my answer was thus. Zheng and Huo refer to the *Rites of Drinking and Archery*, where there are officers called *Sizheng* and *Sihuo*. The market inspector weighs pigs by stepping on them to gauge their weight. Though *Sizheng*, *Sihuo*, and the market inspector have different duties, they are all involved in the same affair. Stepping on the pig—from its upper body to its lower—each step reveals more about its fatness or leanness. The common saying that a pig’s thighs being even indicates its fatness is an example. The more one descends, the more evident the condition becomes—thus, the Dao may be observed. You must not insist on certainty; nothing escapes it.\n\nThe supreme Dao is like this; so too is the great discourse. *Zhou* (all-encompassing), *bian* (pervasive), and *xian* (complete)—these are different names for the same reality, their meaning one. Have you ever wandered together in the Palace of Nothingness, merging in discussion without end? Have you ever practiced non-action together? Serene and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease? My will is emptied—wherever I go, I do not know my destination; departing and returning, I do not know where I rest. I have come and gone yet do not know my end, roaming through the Gate of Vastness. Great wisdom enters and does not know its limit.\n\n*莫* means \"not so\"; *必* means \"certain.\" This aligns with the *Analects*: \"No predisposition, no prejudice.\" The above states the Dao is nowhere absent, so here it says: you must neither insist nor deny—simply follow the natural course of things without resistance. This is what the supreme Dao is like; so too is the great discourse. *Zhou*, *bian*, and *xian*—though different names, their reality is one, encompassing all things. In this way, all is affirmed; otherwise, all is negated—thus, no contention arises.\n\n*尝* means \"to try.\" Have you ever wandered together in the Palace of Nothingness, merging in discussion without end? *寥* means \"empty.\" \"My will is emptied\"—my mind is void. Though I may go somewhere, it is as if I do not go, and I do not know my destination. Though I depart and return, I do not know where I rest. Though I have come and gone, I do not know I have done so—thus, I do not know my end. *Feng hong* is the gate of emptiness. The *Heavenly Questions* asks: \"Feng-yi’s image—how can it be known?\" The *Huainanzi* says: \"Before heaven and earth took form, feng-feng and yi-yi roamed.\" *Feng hong* means roaming through the gate of emptiness—great wisdom enters this gate and does not know its limit.\n\nThe one that gives rise to things has no boundary with things, yet things have boundaries—this is what is called the boundary of things. The boundary of what has no boundary is the boundary that is not a boundary. It is said that fullness and emptiness, growth and decline—what is full and empty is not full and empty, what grows and declines is not growth and decline, what is root and branch is not root and branch, what accumulates and disperses is not accumulation and dispersal.\n\nThe above further elaborates the meaning of not knowing its end or limit. *Wu wu* (the first *wu*): to enumerate and count things by name. *Suo wei* (\"what is called\") refers to what the multitude calls it. The second *wei* (\"it is said\") is the same as *bi* (\"that\"), also pointing to \"that\" which is called. To name and count things is inexhaustible, having no limit with them; what has a limit is merely what the multitude calls the boundary of things. In truth, it has no boundary, yet they call it a boundary—thus, it is the boundary of what has no boundary. What they call a boundary is, in truth, no boundary—thus, it is the boundary that is not a boundary.\n\nJi Hegan studied with the Divine Farmer under Old Dragon Ji. The Divine Farmer, leaning on his armrest, closed the door and dozed at midday. At noon, Ji Hegan pushed open the door and entered, saying: \"Old Dragon is dead.\" The Divine Farmer, still leaning on his armrest, grasped his staff and rose, then suddenly let it fall with a clatter and laughed, saying: \"Heaven knew my perversity, sloth, and arrogance—so pleased with myself—so it cast me aside and let him die. Alas! I have no one to inspire my wild words, and so he has died!\"\n\nYan Gang, hearing of this, said: \"Those who embody the Dao are what the noble ones of the world depend upon. Now, in the Dao, he had not even attained a ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, yet still knew to conceal his wild words before dying—how much more so for those who truly embody the Dao? What is seen has no form; what is heard has no sound. In human discourse, this is called the obscure and dark—thus, to discourse on the Dao is not the Dao.\"\n\n*Pai hu*: to push open the door. *Pao ran*: the sound of the staff being let fall.\n\nThe term \"Heaven\" here refers to Old Dragon Ji. \"I have no one to inspire my wild words, and so he has died\" means that much of what I spoke was reckless and ignorant. While Old Dragon Ji lived, my questions could be examined and corrected. Now that he has died, I have no one to inspire my wild words, and so I too shall fade into oblivion and die.\n\n\"Now, in the Dao, he had not even attained a ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair\" refers to Shen Nong. \"Concealing his wild words\" means having nothing to inspire them.\n\n\"In human discourse, this is called the obscure and dark\" means that those who discuss the Dao describe it as obscure and dark because it has no form and no sound.\n\nThereupon, Tai Qing asked Wu Qiong: \"Do you know the Dao?\"\nWu Qiong said: \"I do not know.\"\nHe then asked Wu Wei, who said: \"I know the Dao.\"\nTai Qing said: \"In your knowing of the Dao, are there principles?\"\nWu Wei said: \"There are.\"\nTai Qing said: \"What are these principles?\"\nWu Wei said: \"I know the Dao can be noble, can be base, can be bound, can be dispersed—these are the principles by which I know the Dao.\"\n\nTai Qing then asked Wu Shi: \"If this is so, then between Wu Qiong’s not-knowing and Wu Wei’s knowing, which is right and which is wrong?\"\nWu Shi said: \"Not-knowing is profound; knowing is shallow. Not-knowing is internal; knowing is external.\"\n\nThereupon, Tai Qing sighed and said: \"Is not-knowing then knowing? Is knowing then not-knowing? Who knows the knowing of not-knowing?\"\n\nWu Shi said: \"The Dao cannot be heard; what is heard is not the Dao. The Dao cannot be seen; what is seen is not the Dao. The Dao cannot be spoken; what is spoken is not the Dao. Do you know that which gives form to the formless? The Dao should not be named.\"\n\nWu Shi said: \"One who answers when asked about the Dao does not know the Dao. Even the one who asks about the Dao has not heard the Dao. The Dao admits no questions; questions admit no answers. To ask what cannot be asked is to ask into the inscrutable. To answer what cannot be answered is to lack inwardness. Responding to the inscrutable with what lacks inwardness—such a one outwardly does not observe the cosmos, inwardly does not know the Great Beginning. Thus, he does not pass beyond Kunlun, nor roam the Great Void.\"\n\nGuang Yao asked Wu You: \"Sir, do you exist? Or do you not exist?\"\nGuang Yao, receiving no answer, gazed intently at Wu You’s appearance: it was empty and hollow. He looked at him all day but saw nothing; he listened but heard nothing; he reached out but grasped nothing.\n\nGuang Yao said: \"This is perfection! Who could attain this? You can be without being, but you have not yet attained non-being. How could one reach this state of non-existence?\"\n\nThe master blacksmith of Da Ma, who forged belt hooks, was eighty years old yet never missed a hair’s breadth in his work. Da Ma asked: \"Is your skill innate, or do you follow a Way?\"\n\nThe smith replied: \"Your servant has a discipline. At twenty, I took delight in forging belt hooks. I saw nothing else in the world—nothing but hooks claimed my attention. Thus, what I employ borrows from what I do not employ, and so I long attain its use. How much more so for one who employs nothing without employing it? What thing does not draw upon this?\"\n\nDa Ma was the Grand Marshal. The \"belt-hook forger\" was a smith who hammered clasps.\n\nRan Qiu asked Confucius: \"Can one know what existed before Heaven and Earth?\"\nConfucius said: \"Yes. The past is as the present.\"\n\nRan Qiu, unsatisfied, withdrew. The next day, he returned and said: \"Yesterday, I asked whether one could know what existed before Heaven and Earth. You said, ‘Yes. The past is as the present.’ Yesterday, I understood clearly; today, I am confused. May I ask what this means?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Yesterday’s clarity came because your spirit first received it. Today’s confusion arises because you now seek it with what is not spirit. There is no past, no present, no beginning, no end. Could there be descendants before there were descendants?\"\n\nRan Qiu had no reply. Confucius said: \"Enough. No answer is needed. Do not use life to give life to death, nor use death to give death to life. Do life and death depend on something? All share a single body. Is there something that existed before Heaven and Earth? That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. Things cannot emerge before that which gives rise to them—just as there is no thing without self. The sage’s love for others never ends, for it draws from this very principle.\n\nThe spirit is the luminous clarity of the human heart. Yesterday’s clarity came when the heart’s spirit first grasped it. Today’s confusion arises when this heart is suddenly obscured, and what is not spirit intrudes. Heaven and Earth have no past or present, no beginning or end. Your question about what existed before Heaven and Earth is like asking whether there could be descendants before there were descendants. ‘No answer is needed’ means Ran Qiu’s question does not require an answer—I have spoken for you.\n\nLife arises of itself; it does not use life to give life to death. Death arises of itself; it does not use death to give death to life. Life and death do not depend on anything—they are simply one body in life, one body in death. How could there be something that existed before Heaven and Earth? That which bursts forth and is called ‘the giving rise to things’ is not itself a thing. Before birth, where was this body? Things cannot emerge before that which gives rise to them. It is as if something gives rise to them, and if something gives rise to them, then the Way of ceaseless arising has no end. The sage’s love for others never ends, for it draws from the principle of ceaseless arising.\"\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"I once heard you say, ‘Do not send off, do not welcome.’ May I ask about its wandering?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"The ancients transformed outwardly but remained untransformed inwardly. People today transform inwardly but remain untransformed outwardly. One who transforms with things is one who does not transform. How can one be at peace with transformation or non-transformation? How can one be at peace and yet grind against them? One must inevitably be worn away until little remains.\n\nThe parks of Xi Wei, the gardens of the Yellow Emperor, the halls of Yu, the chambers of Tang and Wu—these were the domains of rulers. The followers of Confucians and Mohists took them as masters, and so they contended with right and wrong. How much more so for people today? The sage dwells among things without harming them. One who does not harm things cannot be harmed by them. Only one who harms nothing can send off and welcome others.\n\nOne who transforms outwardly but remains untransformed inwardly responds to things without the heart following them. One who transforms inwardly but remains untransformed outwardly has no settled heart and is buffeted by affairs. To transform with things is outward transformation. To remain untransformed is inward non-transformation. What is this ‘peace’? What is transformation? What is non-transformation? How can one be at peace and yet grind against them? One will inevitably be consumed until little remains.\n\nFrom Xi Wei, the Yellow Emperor, Yu, Tang, and Wu down to the Confucians and Mohists, all contended with right and wrong, wearing each other away. How much more so for people today? Contention is more grinding than mere friction. Parks are narrower than gardens. Chambers are deeper than halls. The further one goes, the worse it becomes.\"\n\nThe character \"harm\" (傷) directly corresponds to \"grind\" (磨) and \"wear away\" (). Mountains and forests, marshes and wilds—do they bring me joy? Joy is not yet complete when sorrow follows. The coming of sorrow and joy, I cannot resist; their going, I cannot halt. How lamentable! The world’s people take things as mere inns. They know what they encounter but not what they do not. They know what they can do but not what they cannot. Those without knowledge or ability are indeed what people cannot avoid. Yet striving to avoid what cannot be avoided—is this not also lamentable?\n\nUltimate words transcend words; ultimate actions transcend actions. To equalize knowledge is to make what is known shallow.\n\n*The Twenty-First Scroll of the Xunben Edition of the Nan Hua Zhen Jing* concludes here.¹\n\n*The Twenty-Second Scroll of the Xunben Edition of the Nan Hua Zhen Jing*\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: Gengsang Chu**\n\nAmong the servants of Lao Dan was one named Gengsang Chu, who had partially grasped the Master’s Dao. He went north to dwell in the mountains of Weilei. Those among his retainers who were cunningly clever departed from him; those among his concubines who were ostentatiously kind withdrew.\n\nThose who were dull-witted remained to dwell with him; those who were restless and overbearing he employed as servants. After three years, Weilei flourished abundantly. The people of Weilei said to one another: “When Master Gengsang first arrived, we regarded him with surprise. Now, when we reckon our days, we find them insufficient, but when we reckon our years, we find them abundant. He must be a sage! Why do you not join together to honor him as a spirit, to offer him sacrifices of millet and grain?”\n\nWhen Gengsang Chu heard this, he turned southward, displeased. His disciples found this strange. Gengsang Chu said: “Disciples, why do you find me strange? When spring’s qi arises, the hundred grasses grow; when autumn arrives in due season, the myriad treasures ripen. Is it not the Dao’s unfolding that makes spring and autumn thus? The Perfect One, I have heard, dwells like a corpse in a walled chamber, while the common people roam wildly, not knowing where to turn. Now these petty folk of Weilei secretly wish to place me among the sacrificial vessels of the thousand worthies—am I to be one who is displayed like a marker? This is why I cannot let go of Master Lao Dan’s words. The Perfect One dwells like a corpse in a walled chamber, while the common people roam wildly, not knowing where to go—this means that when the Perfect One conceals himself, people do not know his name and thus wander without direction. A marker is made by raising wood so that all may see it. ‘Cannot let go of Master Lao Dan’s words’ means that the Way of Lao Dan takes non-action as its essence, yet people still cannot forget him; this is why I cannot let go of his words.”\n\nHis disciples said: “Not so. In a ditch of ordinary size, great fish have no room to turn their bodies, while eels and loaches rule there; on a hillock of a few fathoms, great beasts have no place to conceal themselves, while foxes and badgers thrive. Moreover, to honor the worthy and empower the capable, to put goodness and benefit first—this has been so since the time of Yao and Shun, let alone the people of Weilei. Master, you should listen to them.”\n\nGengsang Chu said: “Come here, young ones.”\n\nThe beast that fits in a carriage, once armored and parted from the mountain, cannot escape the snares of nets; the fish that swallows a boat, once beached and parted from the water, is tormented even by ants. Thus birds and beasts do not tire of heights, fish and turtles do not tire of depths. Those who preserve their bodily form and life conceal themselves, and nothing suffices for them but the deepest obscurity.\n\nMoreover, as for those two—Yao and Shun—what are they worth extolling? In their disputations, they would recklessly breach walls to plant mugwort and thistles, comb their hair strand by strand, count grains of rice to cook them—how could such petty fussing ever save the world? Promote the worthy, and the people contend; gather the clever, and the people steal. These measures do not enrich the people. The people’s pursuit of profit is relentless: sons kill fathers, ministers kill rulers; in broad daylight they rob, at midday they plunder.\n\nI tell you: the root of great disorder arose between Yao and Shun, and its branches endure a thousand generations hence. There will surely be men who devour one another.\n\nNanrong Chu sat bolt upright and said: “At my age, I am already old—how can I entrust myself to a practice that might reach such understanding?”\n\nGengsang Chu said: “Preserve your form, embrace your life, and let not your thoughts race restlessly. If you do this for three years, you may attain this understanding.”\n\nNanrong Chu said: “Eyes and form—I do not see their difference, yet the blind cannot see themselves; ears and form—I do not see their difference, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves; heart and form—I do not see their difference, yet the mad cannot grasp themselves. Form and form should open to one another, yet things somehow come between them. We seek each other but cannot find each other. Now you tell me: ‘Preserve your form, embrace your life, let not your thoughts race restlessly.’ I strain to hear the Way, but it reaches only my ears.”\n\nGengsang Chu said: “My words are exhausted. It is said: the fleeing bee cannot transform the hornworm, the Yue chicken cannot hatch the swan’s egg—only the Lu chicken can. Chickens are all chickens, their virtue no different. What distinguishes them is ability or inability, for their talents are inherently great or small. My talent is small and cannot transform you. Why not go south to see Laozi?”\n\nGengsang Chu taught Nanrong Chu to preserve his form, but Nanrong Chu was unconvinced: “Let me speak of form—eyes, ears, heart—all are part of the same body, no different in kind. Yet the blind cannot see themselves, the deaf cannot hear themselves, the mad cannot grasp themselves. When form is bestowed, it should open freely, yet things come between, so that though we seek each other, we cannot find each other. Thus form cannot be preserved whole.” Though Nanrong Chu strained to hear Gengsang Chu’s Way, it reached only his ears—his eyes saw nothing, his heart grasped nothing.\n\nGengsang Chu then drew an analogy: “The common saying captures it: the fleeing bee cannot transform the hornworm, the Yue chicken cannot hatch the swan’s egg. This illustrates that my talent is too small to transform you, so I send you to see Lao Dan.”\n\nNanrong Chu packed provisions and, after seven days and nights, arrived at Laozi’s abode. Laozi said: “Have you come from the land of Chu?”\n\nNanrong Chu said: “Yes.”\n\nLaozi said: “Why have you brought so many people with you?”\n\nNanrong Chu turned fearfully to look behind him.\n\nLaozi said: “Do you not understand what I mean?”\n\nNanrong Chu bowed his head in shame, then looked up and laughed, saying: “Now I have forgotten my answer and so lost my question.”\n\nLaozi said: “What do you mean?”\n\nNanrong Chu said: “If I am ignorant, people call me a fool—like Zhu, who was unworthy, so that later ages call the unperceptive ‘Zhu the fool.’ If I am wise, it only brings sorrow to my body. Without benevolence, I harm others; with benevolence, I bring sorrow upon myself. Without righteousness, I injure others; with righteousness, I bring sorrow upon myself. How can I escape this? These three sayings are my afflictions. I wish to ask you about them through Chu.”\n\nLaozi said: “Just now, I saw it in the space between your brows—I understood you then. Now you speak and confirm it. You are like one who has lost his parents, raising a pole to search the seas—you are a lost man, as if something is missing. Bewildered, you seek to return to your nature but have no way in. Pitiable indeed!”\n\nNanrong Chu asked to enter and rest in his lodging. He summoned what he loved and cast off what he hated. After ten days of sorrow, he saw Laozi again.\n\nLaozi said: “You have cleansed yourself—why are you still so troubled? Yet within, you still brim with what is foul. What is bound on the outside cannot be grasped if one clings too tightly—it must be released from within. What is entangled within cannot be grasped if one forces it—it must be released from without. Those bound both inside and out cannot be held by virtue and power—how much less those who act without the Way?”\n\n“Troubled” here means “distracted.” “Brim” means “overflowing.” You have cultivated and cleansed yourself, appearing composed, but this is only external. Within, you still flow with what is foul.\n\nHere the term \"韄\" signifies binding objects with leather straps to restrain them. \"犍\" refers to the bolt of a door that locks it shut. When what is restrained externally becomes too numerous to grasp, it will turn to internal resistance and closure. When what is restrained internally becomes chaotic and ungraspable, it will turn to external resistance and closure. With such afflictions both inside and out, even one possessed of virtue and power will be unable to maintain equilibrium—how much less those who merely imitate the Way in their conduct?\n\nNanrong Chu said: “When a villager falls ill, his neighbors come to his gate. If the patient can describe his symptoms, yet does not understand the cause of his illness, he remains as one who has not truly fallen ill.” The latter two instances of \"illness\" mean that if one can thoroughly explain the cause of the affliction, though the illness may be severe, it is as if it were not severe at all. “My hearing of the great Dao is like taking medicine that only worsens the disease. I wish only to learn the classic of preserving life.”\n\nLaozi said: “The classic of preserving life—can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it? Can you know good and ill fortune without divination? Can you come to rest? Can you cease? Can you abandon seeking in others and turn to seeking within yourself? Can you be carefree? Can you be uncontrived? Can you be like a child? A child may wail all day without hoarseness—for harmony is at its utmost. He may clench his fists all day without cramping—for he shares in the power. He may gaze all day without blinking—for his attention is not fixed on externals. He moves without knowing where he goes, dwells without knowing what he does, flowing with things and riding their waves. This is the classic of preserving life.”\n\nNanrong Chu said: “Is this then the virtue of the perfected one?” “This is what is called the thawing of ice and the melting of frost. The perfected one shares sustenance with others upon the earth and rejoices with them under heaven. He does not entangle himself with the gains and harms of men and things, nor does he conspire with others in strangeness, scheming, or affairs. He comes and goes with ease, uncontrived. This is the classic of preserving life.”\n\n“Then is this perfection?” “A child acts without knowing what he does, moves without knowing where he goes. His body is like the branch of a withered tree, his heart like dead ashes. In such a state, misfortune does not arrive, nor does fortune come. With neither misfortune nor fortune, how can there be human calamity?”\n\nNanrong Chu doubted whether Laozi’s words on the classic of preserving life were indeed the virtue of the perfected one. Laozi said: “Not so. This is what is called the thawing of ice and the melting of frost. When ice and frost first dissolve, they have not yet fully melted—this is not yet perfection. The perfected one shares sustenance with others upon the earth, comes and goes uncontrived—all this describes the state of the perfected. Yet what was spoken earlier is merely the classic of preserving life.”\n\nThen is this the ultimate state?” Nanrong Chu asked, “Is this the utmost of the Way of preserving life?”\n\nLaozi replied: “It is not yet the ultimate. What I have told you is merely this: one who embodies the childlike can be free from misfortune and fortune. When the cosmos is at peace and settled, it radiates the light of Heaven. One who radiates the light of Heaven—people see such a person, and those who cultivate themselves may thereby attain constancy. Those who attain constancy are abandoned by others yet aided by Heaven. Those abandoned by others are called the people of Heaven; those aided by Heaven are called the sons of Heaven.\n\nThe learner learns what cannot be learned. The doer does what cannot be done. The debater debates what cannot be debated. To know when to stop at what cannot be known—this is the ultimate. If there is any who does not conform to this, the great balance of Heaven will undo him.\n\nWhen the heart’s cosmos is at peace and settled, it naturally radiates the light of Heaven—this is what is called ‘settled life gives rise to wisdom.’ Those who see one radiating the light of Heaven may think it a human ability, yet they do not know it arises from the heart’s cosmos being at peace and settled—this is Heaven. There are those who cannot achieve this settled state of the heart’s cosmos and must rely on cultivation; even so, they cannot radiate the light of Heaven. They may only attain constancy. Those who attain constancy, though abandoned by others, are surely aided by Heaven. Those abandoned by others remain without rank and are the people of Heaven; those aided by Heaven hold rank and are the sons of Heaven.\n\nYet these are not the ultimate. The ultimate must utterly cast aside cleverness, knowledge, and deliberation, as if utterly incapable—only then is it the ultimate. Those who cannot achieve this are undone by the great balance of Heaven; it is not that Heaven does not aid them.\n\nThe great balance is my own great balance. Prepare things to nurture form; store what is unforeseen to establish the heart; maintain reverence within to reach without. If, despite this, myriad evils arrive, they are all of Heaven, not of man—they cannot disturb one’s accomplished virtue, nor can wayward matters enter the numinous terrace. The numinous terrace has something it holds, yet one does not know what it holds, nor can it be held.\n\n*Nurture* means to cultivate; *store* means to preserve; *establish* means to stand. Externally, one prepares things to nurture form; internally, one constantly preserves unforeseen defenses to establish the heart. One maintains reverence within to reach without. If misfortune arrives thus, it is all the decree of Heaven, not summoned by human affairs—it cannot disturb my accomplished virtue, nor can wayward matters enter my heart. Though the heart has something it holds, others do not know what it holds. There is that which cannot be held—this means that which cannot be grasped.\n\nHong Mai’s *Rongzhai Random Jottings* records Hong Qingxiang’s explanation, which is merely a Confucian interpretation: “If one does not see the sincerity within oneself manifest, every manifestation will be inappropriate. Though one’s deeds have entered a situation, one cannot let them go, and each time makes further errors. Doing evil in the open, others may punish it; doing evil in secret, ghosts may punish it. Only when one is clear about others and clear about ghosts can one act alone.”\n\nThis reverses the earlier text. Only when one has not yet achieved sincerity within does every manifestation miss the mark. Though one clearly knows it is insincere, one’s deeds have already entered the situation and cannot be removed. Unable to correct the error, one instead compounds it, thus incurring the calamities of others and ghosts—one cannot speak of wayward matters here.\n\nThose within their allotted bounds act without seeking fame; those beyond their allotted bounds act with expectations of vast expenditure. Those who act without seeking fame, though obscure, have a radiance; those who aspire to vast expenditure are but merchants. People see them as towering, yet they are hollow. Those who exhaust themselves in competition with things find things occupying their place; those who merely accommodate things cannot even contain themselves—how can they contain others? Those who cannot contain others have no intimacy; those with no intimacy are forsaken by all.\n\n*Within their allotted bounds* means within one’s proper role. Those who seek within their proper role do not pursue fame. Those who seek beyond their proper role aspire to vast and lavish expenditure. The *Doctrine of the Mean* says, “The Way of the noble person is vast yet hidden.” Those who act without seeking fame, though obscure, have a radiance in their use. Those who aspire to vast expenditure seek to dazzle and sell themselves in the world, like merchants. Or like one who stands on tiptoe—people see them as towering and grand, yet in truth they are not. Those who go beyond their bounds exhaust themselves in competition with things, and things instead occupy their place. Those within their bounds accommodate things without being burdened, and do not even know they have a self—how could they know others? Without others, even the closest kin are absent; without intimacy, all people are absent. This is the meaning of standing apart from the world.\n\nNo weapon is more reckless than the will; even *Mo Ye* is inferior. No enemy is greater than yin and yang—there is no escape from them between Heaven and Earth. It is not that yin and yang harm one; the heart causes it.\n\nThe Way flows through one’s allotted bounds—its completion is its destruction. What is detestable about allotted bounds is their duality; allotment exists for preparation. Why detest preparation? Because it implies something to prepare for. Thus, to go forth and not return is to see one’s ghost. To go forth and gain is called gaining death. To perish yet have substance—this is one kind of ghost. Using what has form to model what is formless—this is settled.\n\nOriginally, there was no completion or destruction; people divided themselves into two. Thus, the Way flows through one’s allotted bounds. What is detestable about allotment? How does one allot it? If distant, it must reach the extreme. Completion involves a hundred kinds of schemes to achieve success; destruction involves complete abandonment, letting ruin take its course.\n\n*Preparation* means extremity. Why detest extremity? Because once extreme, it is like one who goes forth and does not return. One only sees them pursuing external things, gradually worn away, like a ghost bent and unable to rise. Yet the world believes that going forth brings gain—this is nothing but the way of gaining death.”\n\nThe Way of gaining death extinguishes this life. Yet one believes it possesses true substance—how does this differ from a ghost? Using what has form to model what is formless is to use a person to model a ghost. What is \"settled\" cannot return to being human.\n\nTo go forth without root, to enter without aperture—possessing substance yet without location; having length yet without root or tip, where root and tip are the same. To emerge yet have no aperture is to possess substance. Possessing substance yet without location is space; having length yet without root or tip is time. There is life, there is death; there is going forth, there is entering. Entering and emerging without seeing its form—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is Non-Being. The myriad things emerge from Non-Being. Being cannot use Being to create Being; it must emerge from Non-Being, and even Non-Being is not Non-Being. The sage conceals himself therein.\n\nThe so-called Way emerges without showing its root, enters without showing its aperture, possesses substance yet does not reveal its location. *Piao* is the same as *biao*, meaning \"tip.\" It has length yet does not show its root or tip. Though it emerges without root and enters without aperture, it still possesses substance. It is not empty words—possessing substance yet without location, like the four directions and above and below of space, which have no fixed place. Having length yet without root or tip, like the past and present of time, which have no beginning or end. Life and death, going forth and entering—none reveal their form; this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is emptiness and Non-Being. The myriad things emerge from Non-Being. All Being cannot use Being to create Being; it must emerge from Non-Being, and even Non-Being is not Non-Being. The sage cherishes and conceals this Way.\n\nThe ancients, their knowledge reached a certain point. To what point? Some believed there had never been anything—this is the ultimate, the utmost, beyond which nothing can be added. Those next believed there were things, taking life as loss and death as return—thus they divided themselves. They already split life and death into two paths. Those next said: first there was Non-Being, then there was life, and life swiftly turned to death. They took Non-Being as the head, life as the body, and death as the tail. Who knows the one who guards the unity of Being, Non-Being, death, and life? I befriend such a one.\n\nThough these three differ, they belong to the same clan. The Zhaos and Jings were distinguished by office; the Jia clan was distinguished by fief. They were not the same. *Dai* means official duty; *feng* means enfeoffment. Though these three differ, they are like the Zhaos, Jings, and Jias—all noble clans of Chu—some distinguished by office, some by fief, yet differing in this alone.\n\nThere is life, and the five flavors congeal into blackness—*yan* (black) and *xian* (salty) are pronounced similarly—scattered, it is called \"shifting this.\" Once one speaks of \"shifting this,\" it is no longer what was spoken of. Yet it remains unknowable. The sacrificial meat of the *La* festival includes the tripe—*pi* (pronounced *pihai*, the third stomach of a cow)—which can be separated but not truly divided. One who inspects a house must circle the ancestral temple and bedchambers, then proceed to the resting quarters. This illustrates \"shifting this.\" *Yan* is the blackness at the bottom of a cauldron. *Piran* means \"scattered.\" *Yi shi* means the \"this\" that shifts and does not remain fixed. *La* is the name of the sacrifice held on the third *xu* day after the winter solstice. *Pi* is the omasum (the third stomach of a cow). *Hai* refers to the hair and flesh of the toes. *Yan* is the chamber for rest. What people take as \"this\" is like the specks at the bottom of a cauldron—scattered and shifting, never fixed. Thus it is called \"shifting this.\"\n\nTo speak of \"shifting this\" is fundamentally baseless, yet there are indeed unknowable things. For example, in the *La* sacrifice, the tripe and toe flesh are divided on the platter—this can be separated—but as parts of a single sacrificial animal, they cannot be truly divided. Or when inspecting a house, one must circle the ancestral temple and bedchambers to call it complete, yet one must also reach the resting quarters. To observe one aspect, one must divide to unite; to observe another, one must unite to divide—this is unknowable. From this perspective, where is there a true \"this\"? Thus the saying of \"shifting this.\"\n\nLet us speak of \"shifting this\": taking life as the root, knowledge as the teacher, and thereby riding upon right and wrong. Truly believing in names and realities, taking oneself as the essence, making others take it as one’s integrity—even dying to uphold this integrity. Those who do so use action as wisdom and inaction as foolishness; thoroughness as fame and poverty as disgrace. \"Shifting this\" is the way of people today—like the cicada and the owl, they are the same in their sameness.\n\nThe above speaks of \"there is life, and the five flavors congeal into blackness,\" scattered, called \"shifting this.\" This \"shifting this\" refers to people who take life as fundamental, valuing it too heavily. Following knowledge, they generate right and wrong; believing in names and realities, they know only themselves. Establishing integrity, they would even die without hesitation. Such people are moved by success and failure, poverty and prosperity. Thus, \"shifting this\" is the way of the common people today. How do they differ from the cicada and the owl in their narrow views? People are the same as these creatures—thus it is said they are \"the same in their sameness.\"\n\nTrampling a stranger’s foot in the marketplace, one apologizes profusely; trampling a brother’s foot, one merely soothes him; trampling a parent’s foot, one does not even do that. Thus it is said: the utmost ritual does not involve others; the utmost righteousness does not treat things as things; the utmost knowledge does not scheme; the utmost benevolence has no partiality; the utmost trust repels weapons without need for metal.\n\n*Jian* means \"to tread upon.\" Accidentally stepping on a stranger’s foot in the marketplace, one apologizes excessively for the lack of restraint. Stepping on a brother’s foot, one merely soothes him. For parents, not even soothing is necessary. *Bi* means \"to repel.\" The utmost trust does not require metal or jewels as collateral. It unbinds the knots of ambition, resolves the errors of the heart, removes the burdens of virtue, and opens the blockages of the Way.\n\nThe six of noble rank, wealth, prominence, majesty, fame, and profit stir the ambitions of the will; the six of countenance, movement, complexion, principle, qi, and intent distort the heart; the six of aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight burden virtue; the six of advancing, retreating, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability obstruct the Way. When these four sets of six do not agitate the breast, one is upright; upright, then still; still, then luminous; luminous, then empty; empty, then non-action and yet nothing is not done.\n\nThe passages in the text that are thus verbose and impertinent may well be omitted.\n\nThe Dao is the reverence of virtue; life is the radiance of virtue; nature is the essence of life. *Qin* means \"reverence,\" implying restraint. The Dao precedes virtue, hence it is said: the Dao is the reverence of virtue. With virtue, one nourishes the self, hence it is said: life is the radiance of virtue. Nature arises together with life, hence it is said: nature is the essence of life.\n\nWhen nature moves, it is called *wei*; the artificiality of *wei* is called loss. *Zhi* means \"to engage\"; *zhi* means \"to deliberate.\" The knowledge of what the wise do not know is like a sidelong glance. Movement through necessity is called virtue; movement without self is called governance. Names may oppose one another, yet realities align.\n\nYi excelled at hitting the subtle mark yet was clumsy at preventing others from praising him; the sage excels at Heaven yet is clumsy at humanity. One who excels at Heaven and is *liang* (good) at humanity may yet be capable of humanity. Only the complete person can do so. Only the insect-like can be insect-like; only the insect-like can be Heaven-like. The complete person detests Heaven, detests the Heaven of others, let alone the Heaven of oneself in relation to others.\n\nThe sage excels at uniting with Heaven yet is clumsy at preventing others from praising him. Only the complete person can excel at Heaven and also at humanity—yet how could they boast of this? If the insect-like can be insect-like and also Heaven-like, then being human-like and Heaven-like is not enough to boast of. Thus the complete person detests the reputation of being Heaven-like, and moreover detests the Heaven of others, let alone one’s own Heaven in relation to others.\n\nWhen a single sparrow approaches Yi, Yi must capture it—such is his might. If the world is made into a cage, then no sparrow can escape. Thus Tang used a kitchen servant to enclose Yi Yin, and Duke Mu of Qin used five sheepskins to enclose Bai Li Xi. Therefore, there is nothing that cannot be captured if one uses what they love as the cage.\n\nThe hunchback discards adornment, indifferent to external praise or blame. The convict climbs high without fear, having abandoned life and death. The amputee limps along, his form already incomplete, unconcerned with others’ praise or blame. The convict climbs high without fear, for among prisoners, life and death are held lightly. How can one who is swayed by external glory, disgrace, likes, or dislikes be caged?\n\nResponding without offering and forgetting others—by forgetting others, one thereby becomes a Heavenly person. Thus, one who is revered yet feels no joy, or insulted yet feels no anger, is one who harmonizes with Heavenly harmony. Anger expressed without anger means anger arises from non-anger; action performed as non-action means action arises from non-action. To still the mind, calm the qi; to spiritually attune, follow the heart. In action, to be fitting, align with necessity. The category of necessity is the Way of the sage.\n\n*Fu* means \"to respond.\" *Xie* is the same as *zhe*, meaning \"soft speech.\" In responding, one speaks softly and subtly, as if compelled, never forcing words upon others—so much so that one forgets others. This sentence should be read in three parts.\n\n*Nanhua Zhenjing Xunben*, Scroll Twenty-Two, concludes.\n\n#1 The character *zhe* 者 has been added according to the common edition.\n\n*Nanhua Zhenjing Xunben*, Scroll Twenty-Three\nRecorded by Lu Ling Zhu Feng’s Luo Miandao\nCollated by Disciple Peng Xiang\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: Xu Wugui**\n\nXu Wugui, through the introduction of Nü Shang, was granted an audience with Marquis Wu of Wei.\n*Shiwen* notes: Xu Wugui was a recluse from Minshan in Wei.\nLi [Yun] says: Wugui and Nü Shang were both favored courtiers of Wei.\n\nMarquis Wu greeted him, saying: “Master, you must be weary—exhausted by the toils of mountain and forest, and thus you have come to see me.”\nXu Wugui replied: “It is I who am wearied by you, my lord. What weariness have you for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your likes and dislikes, the true nature of your life will sicken. If you suppress your desires and cast off your likes and dislikes, your ears and eyes will sicken. I would weary you, my lord—what weariness have you for me?”\n\nMarquis Wu, appearing aloof and self-exalted, made no reply.\nAfter a moment, Xu Wugui continued: “Let me tell you how I judge dogs. Those of low quality seize their fill and stop—such is the virtue of a wildcat. Those of middling quality gaze as if toward the sun. Those of the highest quality seem as though they have forgotten their own singularity. Dogs are meant for hunting. The low-quality ones capture only enough to fill their bellies and then cease—this is mere wildcat talent. *De* here means ‘capacity.’ The middling ones, with lofty aspirations and far-reaching vision, like one gazing at the sun in the sky, disregard small prey before them—surely superior to the lower sort. Yet the highest quality ones consider hunting itself beneath them. Though hunting is the dog’s sole purpose, the finest among them lose sight of their specialization, transcending the common dog entirely.”\n\n“My judgment of dogs is not as refined as my judgment of horses. When I judge horses: the straight align with the marking cord, the curved with the hook, the square with the carpenter’s square, the round with the compass. This means they respond to the reins in perfect accord with these measures. Such are the horses of a state—yet they do not compare to the horses of the world. The horses of the world possess a perfected capacity, appearing anxious yet absent, as though they have lost their singularity. *Anxious yet absent*—as if dazed and forgetful. The horse’s singular purpose is to run. When it forgets its specialized task, it emerges as a steed beyond the ordinary. Such horses surpass all bounds, leaving no trace—transcending dust, their destination unknown. *Chaoyi* means ‘to surpass.’ *Juechen* means their hooves do not touch the earth, raising no dust.”\n\nMarquis Wu was greatly pleased and laughed.\nWhen Xu Wugui departed, Nü Shang asked: “Master, how did you alone succeed in delighting my lord? When I attempt to persuade him, whether I expound broadly with the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, or present the subtleties of the *Golden Tallies* and *Six Strategies*—the *Golden Tablets* and *Six Strategies* being chapters from the Zhou *Book of War*, the *Six Strategies* of the Grand Duke comprising the *Civil*, *Martial*, *Tiger*, *Leopard*, *Dragon*, and *Hound*—those who have served him with great merit are beyond counting, yet my lord has never so much as parted his lips. How did you delight him?”\n\n“Did you truly delight my lord to such an extent?”\nXu Wugui replied: “I merely told him how I judge dogs and horses.”\nNü Shang said: “Is that all?”\nXu Wugui said: “Have you not heard of the exiles of Yue? When they have been away from their state for several days, they rejoice at seeing those they know. When they have been away for a month, they rejoice at seeing those they once saw within the state. After a full year, they rejoice even at seeing those who merely resemble people—does this not show that the longer one is parted from others, the deeper one’s longing grows? Now, those who flee into the emptiness of the wilds, where brambles and thorns block the paths of weasels and badgers, stumble through the void, and when they hear the sound of human footsteps—*qiong*—they rejoice. How much more would they rejoice at the voices and coughs of brothers and kin at their side? For too long, has no one offered the words of a true person at my lord’s side?”\n\n*[Annotations within the text:]*\n*Zhu* means “to block.” *Liang* means “to stumble.” *Wei* means “to dwell.” The phrase describes hastening through an empty valley. *Qiongran* is the sound of footsteps. This illustrates how, for so long, no one has spoken essential words to Marquis Wu, so that even hearing talk of dogs and horses brings him joy.\n\nWhen Xu Wugui met with Marquis Wu, the marquis said: “Master, you dwell in the mountains and forests, eating acorns and chestnuts, spurning scallions and leeks, and have kept your distance from me for so long. Are you now aged? Do you crave the taste of wine and meat? Or do you believe I possess the good fortune of the altars of soil and grain?”\nXu Wugui replied: “I, Wugui, was born poor and lowly and have never dared to partake of your lordship’s wine and meat. I have come to offer you service.”\nThe marquis said: “What service? How do you intend to serve me?”\n\nXu Wugui said: \"I come to relieve the strain upon your lordship’s spirit and form.\"\nMarquis Wu said: \"What do you mean?\"\nXu Wugui replied: \"The nurturance of Heaven and Earth is one. Ascending heights does not make one tall; dwelling low does not make one short. Yet you alone, as lord of ten thousand chariots, afflict the people of your state to nourish your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—while the spirit does not consent to this. The spirit delights in harmony and detests perversity. Perversity is sickness, and thus I come to relieve it. Why does your lordship alone suffer from this sickness?\"\n\nMarquis Wu then asked what weighed upon his thoughts and caused him distress.\nMarquis Wu said: \"I have long wished to meet you, Master. I desire to cherish the people and practice righteousness by laying down arms—would this be possible?\"\nXu Wugui said: \"It would not. To cherish the people is the beginning of harming them; to practice righteousness by laying down arms is the root of raising arms. If you persist in this, it will likely not succeed. All perfected beauty is a baleful vessel. Though you act with benevolence and righteousness, you will verge on hypocrisy. Form inevitably begets form; once traces appear, further traces are added. Success inevitably invites attack; change inevitably brings external conflict. Once this heart stirs, it contends with external things.\n\nYou must not array your cranes in battle formation between the towers of the *Liqiao*, nor station infantry and cavalry in the ancestral temples of *Zitan*. The *Helie* is a battle formation, like the *Yuli*. The *Liqiao* is a tower’s name. *Tu* means foot soldiers; *ji*, cavalry. *Zitan* refers to the grounds of ancestral sacrifices. This is to say: desires and strife within the heart are like spears and halberds within a chamber.\n\nDo not store up resistance in your gains, for with gain comes loss, and adversity is already concealed within fortune. Do not seek to overcome others with skill, nor with strategy, nor with warfare. Those who slaughter the people’s soldiers and seize their lands to nourish their own selfishness and spirit—how can one know which side is right? Where does victory lie?\n\nIf you cannot desist, then as the saying goes—even if Mencius could not stop, there is still one path: cultivate sincerity within your breast to respond to the feelings of Heaven and Earth, and do not provoke conflict. The people’s deaths will have ceased; what need will you then have for laying down arms?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor, seeking to meet the Great Vastness at Mount Jucí, had Fangming as his driver and Changyu as his outrider. Zhangruo and Xipeng rode ahead of the horses, while Kunhun and Guji followed in the rear carriage. When they reached the wilds of Xiangcheng, the Seven Sages all lost their way and had no one to ask for directions. They happened upon a boy herding horses and asked him the way. \"Do you know Mount Jucí?\" they said. \"I do,\" he replied. \"Do you know where the Great Vastness resides?\"\n\nThe boy replied, \"I do.\"\nThe Yellow Emperor said, \"How extraordinary, little boy! Not only do you know Mount Jucí, but you also know where the Great Vastness resides. May I ask how to govern the world?\"\nThe boy said, \"Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to do? When I was young, I roamed freely within the Six Directions. The boy is not truly a boy, but merely appears youthful. I once suffered from a sudden affliction of dim-sightedness, and an elder instructed me: 'Ride the chariot of the sun and wander the wilds of Xiangcheng.' Because of my dim-sightedness, he taught me to ride the sun’s chariot so that I could see by following its light. Now that my illness has slightly improved, I am about to roam beyond the Six Directions. Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to do?\"\nThe Yellow Emperor said, \"Governing the world is indeed not your concern. Nevertheless, may I ask how to govern it?\"\nThe boy declined to answer. The Yellow Emperor asked again.\nThe boy said, \"What difference is there between governing the world and herding horses? It is merely a matter of removing what harms the horses.\"\nThe Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and departed, calling him \"Heavenly Master.\"\n\nA scholar finds no joy without the changes of thought and contemplation; an eloquent speaker finds no joy without the order of discourse and persuasion.\n\nThe scrutinizing scholar finds no joy without matters of critique and inquiry—all are confined by things. *Ling* means to override; *ping* means to question. They override and question every matter.\n\nThose who summon the age serve in court; those of middling ability take pride in office; those of physical strength boast of hardships; the brave rush into peril; warriors delight in battle; recluses cling to fame; legalists expand governance; ritualists revere decorum; the benevolent and righteous value connections. *Zhaoshi* means taking the world as one’s own task, as if stirring it; *xing chao* means standing in court; *su ming* means leaving a name; *gui ji* means prizing social ties.\n\nFarmers without the work of clearing weeds grow estranged; merchants without the bustle of markets grow estranged; commoners with daily tasks are diligent; artisans with skill in tools are bold. *Bi* means unity—without it, they lose their livelihood and scatter. *Quan* means exerting effort; *zhuang* means acting with courage.\n\nWealth unaccumulated troubles the greedy; power unconsolidated saddens the boastful—those who love grandeur and crave influence delight in change. When the times afford use, they cannot remain inactive. All these follow the seasons in accord, not altering with things.\n\nThey exhaust their bodies and natures, sinking into the myriad things, never returning—how lamentable! *Wu* means affairs; *tu* means kind. Those fond of power and change take joy in inconstancy. One should meet such times with equanimity; when opportunity arises, one cannot remain inactive, yet need not act like the greedy or boastful. Those who understand this principle align with the seasons without shifting with things. Yet people today exhaust their bodies and natures, sinking into the myriad things unawares, living out their lives without return—how pitiable!\n\nZhuangzi said: \"An archer who hits the mark without aiming is called a master shot—would it be right to say all under heaven are Yi?\" Huizi said: \"Yes.\" Zhuangzi said: \"If there is no universal rightness, and each takes their own rightness as right, would it be right to say all under heaven are Yao?\" Huizi said: \"Yes.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Then the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists—four schools—and you make five. Which is truly right? Or is it like Lu Ju? His disciple said: ‘I have grasped the Master’s Way! I can heat a cauldron in winter and make ice in summer!’ Lu Ju said: ‘This merely summons yang with yang and yin with yin—it is not what I call the Way. Let me show you my Way.’ Thereupon, he tuned two zithers, placing one in the hall and one in the chamber. When he plucked the *gong* note on one, the *gong* note on the other sounded; when he plucked the *jue* note, the *jue* note responded—their pitches were in harmony. Then he altered one string so it no longer fit the five notes. When he plucked it, all twenty-five strings vibrated, yet the sound was not distinct, for it had become the ruler of tones. Is this not like that?\n\nAn archer must aim at the target to hit it—this is called a master shot. If one hits by chance without aiming, would it be right to say all under heaven are Yi? This illustrates that if there is no universal rightness, and each takes their own rightness as right, would it be right to say all under heaven are Yao?\n\nHeating a cauldron in winter means making fire without flame in cold weather; making ice in summer means creating ice without cold in heat. Though these seem marvelous, they merely follow winter’s yang to summon yang for fire, or summer’s yin to summon yin for ice—nothing extraordinary.\n\n*Fei* means to place. He set one zither in the hall and one in the chamber. Plucking the *gong* note on one caused the *gong* note on the other to sound; plucking the *jue* note caused the *jue* note to respond. This seems marvelous, yet it occurs because their pitches harmonize—nothing extraordinary. Like when Cao Shaokui, a master of tones, visited a monk in Luoyang whose chime would sound day and night of its own accord. The monk, deeming it strange, fell ill. Shaokui, a friend, came to inquire. The monk explained, and just then, striking a bell caused the chime to sound again. Shaokui laughed: \"Prepare a feast tomorrow, and I will rid you of this.\" The monk complied. After eating, Shaokui took a file from his sleeve, struck the chime several times, and the sound ceased. The monk pressed him for the reason. He said: \"The chime’s pitch matched the bell’s, so they resonated.\" The monk rejoiced, and his illness was cured.\n\nAnother example: Li Sizhen heard a carriage bell’s echo underground. Digging, he found a bell—such things happen.\"\n\nThe term *dang* (当) means \"to govern.\" As the *Xue Ji* states: \"When a drum is struck without aligning with the pitch of the five tones, or when a single string is altered apart from the five notes, yet the drum is sounded without a governing tone, all twenty-five strings will resonate. Though this one string initially differs in no way, it becomes the master of all sounds. Thus, when struck, the other strings obey its command.\"\n\nThe sixty-four modes all arise from the *huangzhong* gong, for gong is the sovereign and thus commands the other pitches. This is but the natural principle—what is there to find strange? If such is the case, then Yuhuizi’s self-assurance resembles that of Lu Ju.\n\nHuizi said: \"Now, the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists all engage me in debate, clashing words and overpowering voices, yet they have never proven me wrong—what do you make of that?\" Huizi replied: \"Zhuangzi says I stand with the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists as five, yet who is correct? The four cannot refute me, so I am right, and they are wrong. What of this argument?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"A man of Qi sent his son to Song to serve as a gatekeeper, dismissing him because his body was imperfect. Yet though his form was flawed, he was still his own son—how could he bear to cast him out? Consider this: when seeking a tripod or bell, one binds and secures it for fear of damage. How does this compare to abandoning one’s child? Or when seeking a servant for the hall path, one keeps him within the domain—how does this differ from exiling a son abroad? In such ways, the principle of kinship is neglected. People are blinded by distinctions of closeness and distance, nobility and baseness, near and far, unaware of their own delusion. This illustrates how Huizi recognizes the errors of the four schools yet fails to see his own.\"\n\nThe man of Chu who lodged aboard a boat and served as a gatekeeper in exile once fought with a boatman in the dead of night, though he had not yet reached shore—enough to sow resentment. *Li* (离) means \"to reach,\" and *cen* (岑) refers to a mountain bank. The man of Chu, dwelling on a boat and limping as a gatekeeper in a foreign land, quarreled with the boatman at night when no one was present. He did not consider that before reaching shore, such conflict would only breed enmity. This further illustrates that contention not only blinds one to reason but also invites disaster.\n\nZhuangzi, passing by Huizi’s grave while attending a funeral, turned to his followers and said: \"A man of Ying had plaster as thin as a fly’s wing on the tip of his nose. He called upon Craftsman Shi to carve it away. Craftsman Shi swung his axe like the wind, heeding the task and striking, removing all the plaster without harming the nose. The man of Ying stood unmoved. When the Lord of Song heard of this, he summoned Craftsman Shi and said, 'Try it for me.' Craftsman Shi replied, 'Your servant once could do this. However, my partner is gone. The one who stood still was my partner. The one who struck was my tool. He has been dead for a long time. Since the Master’s passing, I have had no partner, no one to speak with.'\"\n\nWhen Guan Zhong fell ill, Duke Huan asked him: \"Your illness has grown severe. If it worsens, to whom should I entrust the state?\" Guan Zhong asked: \"Whom does the Duke wish to appoint?\" The Duke said: \"Bao Shuya.\" Guan Zhong replied: \"He will not do.\"\n\nGuan Zhong was a man of spotless integrity, a true gentleman. Toward those who fell short of his standards, he would not align himself; once he heard of another’s fault, he would remember it for life. If placed in charge of the state, above, he would oppose and thwart his lord; below, he would defy the people. It would not be long before he offended the ruler.\" The Duke said, \"Then who is suitable?\" Guan Zhong replied, \"If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do. His character is such that he forgets those above and neglects those below. He feels ashamed that he does not measure up to the Yellow Emperor, yet he pities those who fall short of himself. To distribute virtue among others is the mark of a sage; to distribute wealth among others is the mark of a worthy. To rule others with one’s worthiness has never won their hearts; to humble oneself before others with one’s worthiness has never failed to win their hearts. In governing the state, there are things he does not hear; in managing his household, there are things he does not see. If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do.\"\n\nThe King of Wu was sailing on the river when he ascended the Mountain of Monkeys. The troop of monkeys, seeing him, scattered in fear, fleeing into the dense thickets. One monkey, however, lingered—twisting and turning, it plucked and scratched, swinging and climbing with such skill that it caught the king’s eye. The king shot at it, but the monkey deftly caught the arrow in midair. The king then ordered his attendants to hasten their shots, and the monkey, clutching the arrow, died. The king turned to his companion, Yan Buyi, and said: \"This monkey flaunted its skill, relied on its agility, and thus behaved arrogantly toward me—only to meet this fate. Take heed!\" Alas.\n\nDo not let your countenance make you arrogant toward others! Upon returning, Yan Buyi took Dong Wu as his teacher, to temper his bearing, renouncing pleasure and ostentation. Three years later, the people of the state praised him.\n\nNanbo Zimo sat leaning on his armrest, gazing upward and sighing. Yan Chengzi entered and said: \"Master, you are the rarest of beings. Can one truly make the body like withered wood, the heart like dead ashes?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Once I dwelt at the mouth of a mountain cave. At that time, when Tian He caught sight of me, the multitudes of Qi thrice congratulated him—congratulating him on having found worth. I had to first relinquish it, and thus they knew it; I had to first offer it for sale, and thus they bought it. Had I not possessed it, how could they have known it? Had I not sold it, how could they have purchased it? Alas! I grieve for those who lose themselves; I grieve, too, for those who grieve for others; and I grieve yet again for those who grieve over the grief of others. From then on, the distance grows daily. From this point onward, the sorrow extends endlessly.\"\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, the King of Chu offered him a toast. Sunshu Ao stood holding the goblet, while Shinan Yiliao received the wine and made an offering, saying: \"Men of old—here, their words end.\" He praised Confucius, declaring him incomparable to men of today, and begged him to speak.\n\nConfucius said: \"I have heard of the wordless word, yet never before have I spoken it. Here, now, I shall speak: Shinan Yiliao juggled his balls and resolved the conflict between two families; Sunshu Ao slept soundly, feather fan in hand, and the people of Ying laid down their weapons. Would that I had a beak three feet long!\"\n\nSunshu Ao was the son of Wei Jia, named Ai Lie, and served as Prime Minister under King Zhuang of Chu—before Confucius’ time. Shinan Yiliao was skilled at juggling balls and bells, keeping eight in the air while one remained in his hand. When Chu and Song went to war, Yiliao bared his chest and performed his juggling before the army, halting the battle and securing victory. This, too, occurred after Confucius’ death. It is but an allegory.\n\nConfucius spoke of two men who resolved conflict and stilled weapons through non-action—then why should I speak at all? If words were of use, I would wish for a beak three feet long; if words were of no use, such a beak would be useless. That is what they call the Way beyond the Way, and this is what they call the eloquence beyond words. \"They\" refers to the two men; \"this\" refers to Confucius. Thus, virtue encompasses the unity of the Dao, and words cease where knowledge knows no more—this is perfection. The unity of the Dao cannot be matched by virtue; what knowledge cannot know cannot be expressed by eloquence. To bear the names of Confucian or Mohist is already perilous.\n\nThus, the sea does not refuse the eastward flow—such is its boundlessness. The sage embraces heaven and earth, bestowing blessings upon the world, yet none know his name. Therefore, in life he holds no rank, in death he bears no posthumous title; no wealth is amassed, no fame is established—this is the Great Man. A dog is not deemed good for its fine barking, nor a man for his fine words—how much less so for greatness. To be great is not enough to be called great, and how much less so for virtue. Yet nothing is more complete than heaven and earth. What do they seek to be so complete? One who knows completeness seeks nothing, loses nothing, discards nothing, and does not exchange the self for things. Turning inward without exhaustion, following antiquity without friction—this is the sincerity of the Great Man.\n\nZiqi had eight sons; he lined them up before him and summoned Jiufang Yin, saying: \"Examine my sons for me and tell me which is most auspicious.\" Jiufang Yin replied: \"Kun is the most auspicious.\" Ziqi started in surprise and joy: \"In what way?\" He said: \"Kun will share the ruler’s table and feast until the end of his days.\" Ziqi’s face fell, and tears welled up: \"How could my son come to such an extreme?\" Jiufang Yin said: \"To share the ruler’s table brings blessings to three clans—how much more to his parents. Now, sir, you hear this and weep—this is to reject fortune. The son is auspicious, but the father is not.\" Ziqi said: \"Yin, how could you know this? Is Kun truly auspicious? His fate is bound to meat and wine, entering only through nose and mouth—how could you know its origin? I have never herded, yet a ewe was born in the inner chamber; I have never hunted, yet a quail hatched in the hearth. I have never tended sheep, never hunted, yet these creatures appeared in my home as if born in the inner chamber or hearth. This echoes the *Book of Songs*: *'Without hunting, without stalking, why do I see quails hanging in your courtyard?'* Yet if one does not marvel at such things, what is there to wonder at?\n\nThose with whom I wander wander through heaven and earth; with them I roam in joy beneath the sky, with them I feast upon the earth. I do not involve myself in their affairs, do not join their schemes, do not share their marvels. With them I ride the sincerity of heaven and earth, untouched by things, and drift along without being bound to their concerns. Now, if this is so, is there any recompense from the world? Wherever strange omens appear, strange conduct must follow. Alas, this is not the fault of my son or me—it is heaven’s doing. This is why I weep.\"\n\nBefore long, Kun was sent to Yan, where bandits seized him on the road. Selling him whole would be difficult, but maiming him would make it easy. So they cut off his feet and sold him in Qi, where he ended up in the marketplace of Qu Gong—yet he still ate meat and lived out his days.\n\nNie Que met Xu You and asked: \"Where are you going?\" He replied: \"I am fleeing from Yao.\" \"Why?\" \"Yao is so earnestly benevolent that I fear he will become a laughingstock to the world. Future generations may even turn to cannibalism. The people are not hard to gather: love them and they draw near, benefit them and they come, praise them and they are encouraged, bring them what they hate and they scatter. Love and benefit arise from benevolence and righteousness, but those who discard benevolence and righteousness are few, while those who profit from them are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness lacks sincerity and is but a tool for the greedy and rapacious. Thus, for one man to decide what benefits the world is like a fleeting glance—momentary and unreliable. Yao knows that worthy men benefit the world but does not see that they also harm it. Only those beyond worthiness understand this.\"\n\nThere are those who are *nuan shu*, those who are *ru xu*, and those who are *quan lou*. The *nuan shu* learn the words of a single master, warming themselves with self-satisfaction, delighting in their own beauty, and believing themselves complete—yet they do not know that nothing has truly begun. This is what is called *nuan shu*. The *ru xu* are like lice on a pig: they choose sparse bristles, thinking it a vast palace; they nestle in the crooks of hooves, between teats and thighs, believing it a safe and comfortable dwelling. They do not know that one day the butcher will roll up his sleeves, spread straw, and light the fire—then they and the pig will burn together. They advance and retreat within their narrow domain—this is what is called *ru xu*. At ease, they cannot extricate themselves. *Ru* means stagnation; *xu* means waiting.\n\nThe *quan lou* is like Shun. Mutton does not long for ants, but ants long for mutton—because of its rank odor. Shun had a rank character, and the people delighted in him. He moved three times, and each time his settlement became a city; by the time he reached Deng’s ruins, he had a hundred thousand households. Yao, hearing of Shun’s worthiness, raised him from barren land, saying: \"I hope to receive his blessings.\" Shun was raised from barren land, his years advanced, his senses dulled, yet he could not return to rest—this is what is called *quan lou*. Bent and hunched, unable to stand upright. Thus, the spirit-man detests the multitude’s approach, for when the multitude comes, they do not harmonize, and when they do not harmonize, no benefit arises.\n\nThus, he has no extreme attachments, no extreme estrangements, embracing virtue and warming harmony to align with the world—this is called the Perfected Person.\n\nTo ants, he abandons knowledge; to fish, he attains strategy; to sheep, he abandons intent.\n\nWith eyes, he sees eyes; with ears, he hears ears; with heart, he returns to heart.\n\nSuch a one is level as a plumb line in stillness, and in change, follows the course. Above, it speaks of Shun gaining the multitude yet being unable to return to rest. Thus, it says the spirit-man detests the multitude’s approach, for when the multitude comes, each has likes and dislikes, and when they do not harmonize, strife arises, bringing no benefit. Therefore, one who holds no partiality in relations, embraces the Dao and warmth, aligning with the world—this is called the Perfected Person.\n\nAs for the earlier saying that ants long for mutton, ants possess knowledge, so they cannot be without desire. Sheep cannot be without intent, so they cannot be without rankness. The Perfected Person, however, to ants abandons knowledge, to sheep abandons intent. The insertion of \"to fish, he attains strategy\" follows naturally from the earlier discourse on the joy of fish in the Hao River.\n\n\"With eyes, he sees eyes; with ears, he hears ears; with heart, he returns to heart\"—these are no ordinary words. Without personally entering this state, one cannot know its levelness. \"Level as a plumb line\" describes the state of absolute stillness, where the line is straight and without crookedness. \"In change, follows the course\" describes the state of responding to things. \"Follows\" means that in the interplay of events, one responds with compliance, not being disturbed by them.\n\nThe Perfected Person of old awaited all with Heaven, not imposing human will upon Heaven. Heaven is spontaneity; humanity is contrivance. The Perfected Person of old: in gaining, it is life; in losing, it is death; in gaining, it is death; in losing, it is life—like medicine. In truth, *dong quai*, platycodon, chicken gizzard, and *shi ling* are each sovereign in their time—how can they all be named?\n\nGoujian, with three thousand armored men, perched on Mount Kuaiji, yet only Zhong knew how to preserve what was lost, and only Zhong did not know how sorrow would come to his own body. The Perfected Person of old entrusted gain and loss to spontaneity, recognizing that gain must entail loss, and loss must entail gain. One thing’s birth means another’s death; one thing’s death means another’s birth. They ever depend upon one another.\n\nTaking medicine as an analogy: *dong quai* and platycodon, chicken gizzard, and *shi ling* serve as sovereign, minister, assistant, and envoy in turn—where is constancy in gain or loss? Again, taking the affair of Yue as proof: Minister Zhong knew that after Yue’s fall it could be preserved, yet did not realize that in turn it would cost his own life—both are cases of gain and loss without constancy.\n\nThus it is said: The owl’s eyes have their proper use; the crane’s legs have their proper measure—severing them brings sorrow. From here, five *gu* (\"thus\") clauses further expound the meaning:\n\nThe owl’s eyes are bright at night and dim by day, each suited to its time. The crane’s legs are long or short as circumstance demands, each fitted to its measure. If severed with a blade, their life is harmed. The point is simply to follow their spontaneity.\n\nThus it is said: When wind passes, the river is diminished; when the sun passes, the river is diminished. Yet if only wind and sun were to guard the river together, the river would deem itself never disturbed—it relies on its source to flow onward. This passage returns to a more intimate point: it does not teach one to forcibly dismiss things as they arise. Rather, one must possess an inner constancy, like water with its source, to achieve this.\n\nThus water guards earth with certainty; a shadow guards its person with certainty; things guard their counterparts with certainty. This principle means that root and branch ever guard one another without separation—like water guarding earth, a shadow guarding its person, things guarding their counterparts—fixed and unchanging.\n\nThus the eye’s reliance on clarity is perilous; the ear’s reliance on acuity is perilous; the heart’s pursuit of externals is perilous. Whatever the faculty, its reliance on its storehouse is perilous. Once peril is formed, it cannot be altered. Disaster’s growth is swift and dense; its reversal depends on gradual effort; its fruition requires time. Yet people treasure these as their own jewels—is this not lamentable? Thus nations fall and peoples are slaughtered without end, yet none inquire into this.\n\nAgain, the three *dai* (\"perilous\") terms invert the earlier three *shen* (\"certain\") terms: heart, ears, and eyes—if they chase externals, they cannot remain fixed and become perilous. Expanding further, whatever one is capable of becomes harmful; the storehouse encompasses all. Once peril is formed, it cannot be altered, and disaster’s growth accelerates. To reverse peril into safety, disaster into fortune, one must follow the gradual path. Following is the work of incremental progress; even those who rigidly overcome themselves must wait long before speaking of goodness—for goodness is exceedingly difficult.\n\nYet the world indulges the desires of ears, eyes, and the heart’s cleverness as if they were treasures. In small matters, this brings ruin to the self; in great matters, it brings down nations and slaughters peoples—its calamity never ceases. Few indeed understand this inquiry.\n\nThus the foot’s contact with the ground is limited, yet it relies on what it does not tread to walk broadly. Human knowledge is scant, yet it relies on what it does not know to comprehend Heaven’s design.\n\nTo know the Great Unity, the Great Yin, the Great Eye, the Great Balance, the Great Square, the Great Faith, the Great Constancy—this is perfection. The Great Unity unites them; the Great Yin dissolves them; the Great Eye observes them; the Great Balance harmonizes them; the Great Square embodies them; the Great Faith verifies them; the Great Constancy sustains them.\n\nThere is a consummation of Heaven; there is a luminous following; there is a pivot in darkness; there is a beginning that has its counterpart. Thus, to dissolve them seems like not dissolving; to know them seems like not knowing. Only by not knowing can one come to know.\n\nThe ground the foot treads is minimal, yet what it does not tread is essential for walking. What knowledge grasps is minimal, yet what it does not grasp is the greater part. Knowing the Great Unity, the Great Yin, the Great Eye, the Great Balance, the Great Square, and the Great Faith may seem to encompass all, yet there remains an inexhaustible Heaven. One may believe they follow only what they ought, yet there is always something overseeing. One may think all is obscure, yet there is one who holds the pivot. One may think this is the beginning, yet there is always a counterpart—this counterpart then becomes the new beginning.\n\nFollowing the earlier statement that the Great Yin dissolves, this ultimate inquiry makes dissolution seem like non-dissolution, knowledge like non-knowledge. Only by not knowing can one truly know.\n\nThis inquiry cannot be bounded, yet it cannot be boundless. It is slippery yet substantial; ancient and modern do not replace it, nor can it be diminished—can this not be called the great *yanghuo*? Why then remain perplexed? To resolve confusion with non-confusion and return to non-confusion is the highest non-confusion.\n\nThe earlier passage spoke of \"not knowing to inquire,\" so here the character for \"inquiry\" is brought forward to conclude. If one inquires into this Dao, it has no bounds yet is never without bounds. What is spoken may seem like the debates of *hua* and *jian* (firmness and whiteness), yet here there is substance. All things undergo change, yet this remains unchanged and undiminished.\n\n*Yanghuo*: Xu Shen’s commentary on the *Huainanzi* states it is a term for vast numbers. The explanation is still unclear. *Yang* means to raise or proclaim; *huo* means to turn the hand repeatedly. It refers to raising and answering questions while gesturing with the hands. These two characters likely reflect contemporary colloquial usage—even today, Chan masters ascend the seat to expound the Dharma in this manner. Though the Dao’s discourse may seem divergent, it is in fact real—is this not a great proclamation? Why not inquire into this instead of remaining deluded? If one can resolve another’s confusion with one’s own non-confusion, enabling them to return to non-confusion, then perhaps all may be free from confusion. Even without an inquirer, one still hopes for someone to awaken—this is how those among the immortals direct their minds.\n\nThe twenty-third scroll of the *Nanhua True Scripture: Following the Original Text* concludes.\nThe twenty-fourth scroll of the *Nanhua True Scripture: Following the Original Text*\nRecorded by Luoling Zhu Feng’s Luo Miandao, collated by his disciple Peng Xiang\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: Zeyang**\n\nZeyang traveled in Chu. Yi Jie spoke of him to the king, but the king did not summon him. Yi Jie returned.\n\nA man of Peng, surnamed Peng Yang, saw King Guo and said: “Why does the Master not speak of me to the king?”\nKing Guo replied: “I am not equal to Gong Yuxiu.”\nPeng Yang said: “What does Gong Yuxiu do?”\nThe king said: “In winter, he retreats alone to the river to catch turtles; in summer, he rests in the mountain thickets. If someone passes by and asks, he says: ‘This is my home.’”\n\nPeng Yang was eager for advancement, so the king used the words of a recluse to make him reflect. “If even Yi Jie is incapable, how much more so am I? I am not even Yi Jie’s equal.”\n\nNow, Yi Jie’s character was such that he lacked virtue but possessed cunning. He did not commit himself but used his connections to mystify his dealings, firmly entangled in the realm of wealth and honor. Such men do not aid others with virtue but instead consume them. Like one freezing who borrows clothes in spring, or one sweltering who turns to winter’s cold wind—so too is the King of Chu.\n\nThe King of Chu’s bearing was imposing and stern. In punishing offenses, he was as relentless as a tiger. Without a man of true virtue to correct him, who could sway him?\n\nThus, when the sage is in adversity, he makes his family forget their poverty; when he prospers, he makes kings and lords forget their ranks and emoluments, transforming them to humility. Toward things, he delights in harmony; toward people, he rejoices in their communion while preserving himself.\n\nThus, sometimes without speaking, he harmonizes others; standing beside them, he transforms them—like the natural bond between father and son. When he returns to his dwelling, he remains at ease in his conduct. His influence on others’ hearts is so distant that he says: “Wait for Gong Yuxiu.”\n\nOne who does not commit himself but mystifies his dealings humbles himself to follow others, leaving them unable to fathom his motives. The freezing man, upon meeting spring, finds clothing; the sweltering man, upon meeting a cold wind, reverts to winter. This illustrates that though the King of Chu is steeped in the pursuit of profit and desire, with proper guidance, he is easily swayed.\n\n“Flatterers” refers to men like Yi Jie; “true virtue” refers to men like Gong Yuxiu. To subdue flatterers, one uses flattery; to subdue the upright, one uses the upright Way. “Transforming to humility” means becoming humble. “Standing beside others and transforming them” means standing with them and fostering the intimacy of father and son.\n\n“Ah, that man!”—whether concealing or acting, he remains unmoved by external concerns, far removed from the common heart of profit and desire. So distant is he.\n\nThis is the meaning of “This is my home.”\n\nThe above speaks of Gong Yuxiu.\n\nAs for Yi Jie, he could not reach the point of mutual aid and dissolution—thus the persuasion of Yi Jie. As for the freezing man, who can sway him once warmth arrives? Thus the persuasion of the King of Chu. Therefore, the sage descends below, and again speaks of following Gong Yuxiu above.\n\nThe sage comprehends the entangled, encompassing all as one body, yet unaware of why it is so—this is nature. Returning to the root, reviving the mandate, and moving with Heaven as teacher, others then follow and name him thus.\n\nAnxious in knowledge, yet his actions seldom align with the moment—how can he find stillness?\n\n\"Entangled\" refers to the knotted intricacies of affairs and principles, which only the sage can fully grasp. Permeating the entire body without exception, yet unaware of its source—this is what is meant by \"nature,\" its tranquility. Returning to the root, reviving the mandate, its movement—all stirring and arising—accords with Heaven. Others then follow and name him a sage.\n\nAnxious in knowledge, yet his actions seldom align with the moment—this is the meaning of \"though man’s years do not reach a hundred, he bears the cares of a thousand.\" One born beautiful, others offer him a mirror; if uninformed, he does not know his beauty surpasses others. Whether he knows or does not know, whether he hears or does not hear, his joy remains unceasing, and others’ admiration for him is likewise endless—this is nature.\n\nThe sage’s love for others: others bestow the name upon him, yet if uninformed, they do not know of his love. Whether they know or do not know, whether they hear or do not hear, his love for others remains unceasing, and their contentment in him is likewise endless—this uses man to illustrate the sage.\n\nAn old state, an old capital—gazing upon them brings boundless delight. Even if hills, grasses, and trees fill nine-tenths of the view, the delight remains; how much more when seeing what is seen and hearing what is heard, like a ten-*ren* tower hung with the music of the masses.\n\nRan Xiangshi grasped the center of the ring, following completion without beginning or end, without moment or interval. Daily transforming with things, he alone remains unchanging.\n\n\"Boundless delight\" means joy. \"Filling\" means convergence. \"The music of the masses\" refers to the interludes of *sheng* and *yong*. \"The center of the ring\" is the empty space within. Gazing upon an old state or capital, none fail to rejoice; even if grasses and trees fill nine-tenths, the joy persists—how much more when seeing what is seen and hearing what is heard, like a ten-*ren* tower hung with the music of the masses? Who would not see, who would not hear?\n\nLike Ran Xiangshi, who grasped the principle of emptiness within, daily transforming with things yet never truly changing.\n\nHe never abandons it.\n\nHow could he ever abandon it? \"Abandon\" means to cast aside. How could he ever elevate or set aside affairs without engaging with them?\n\nThose who follow Heaven yet fail to attain it follow both Heaven and things to their doom. In their conduct of affairs, what can be done? The sage has never begun with Heaven, never begun with man, never begun with beginnings, never begun with things. Moving with the world without ceasing, what he practices is complete yet never stagnant. In his convergence with it, what can be done?\n\nTang found his charioteer, and Menyin Dengheng served as his mentor. Following the teacher without constraint, he attained the principle of following completion. In governing, he oversaw the names of names; in applying the law, he achieved dual insight.\n\nConfucius exhausted his thoughts to serve as his mentor. The House of Rongcheng said: \"Remove the days, and there are no years; no inner, no outer.\" Heaven is spontaneity. If one insists on discarding laws to imitate others, this is not spontaneity. Those in the world who are not at peace with their nature sacrifice themselves to things. In their conduct of affairs, what can be done? This speaks of their inability to align with the Dao in their actions.\n\nThe sage, then, transcends even the absence of Heaven. Moreover, he causes kings and lords to forget rank and emolument, transforming them to humility. In relation to things, he delights in their communion; in relation to people, he rejoices in their connection while preserving himself.\n\nThus, some may remain silent yet harmonize others with a single utterance; standing alongside others, they transform them to the fitting bond of father and son.\n\nIn their return to stillness, they unify the scope of their influence. As for their effect upon the minds of outsiders, it is so distant that one says: \"Await Gongyue Xiu.\" Those who do not assert themselves to spiritually engage with others bend themselves to follow others, yet none can fathom their underlying intent.\n\nThe frozen, upon encountering spring, become as if clad in garments; the parched, upon meeting a cool breeze, revert to winter’s chill. This illustrates that even if King Chu is sunk in the depths of profit and desire, with proper guidance, he too may easily be led to follow.\n\n\"Flatterers\" refers to the likes of Yi Jie; \"those of upright virtue\" refers to the likes of Gongyue Xiu. One subdues flatterers by bending to their flattery, while one subdues the upright by means of the upright Way.\n\n\"Transformed to humility\" means transformed into humility and submission. \"Standing alongside others and transforming them\" refers to the fitting bond of father and son—standing alongside others, one transforms them into the intimacy of father and son.\n\n\"Ah, such a one!\" is an exclamation of admiration. Whether concealing or employing their abilities, they remain unmoved by external concerns, free from the common person’s mind of profit and desire—so distant is this from the ordinary.\n\nThis is but a provisional dwelling.\n\nThe above speaks of Gongyue Xiu.\n\nAs for Yi Jie, who could not reach the point of mutual aid and dissolution, it now speaks of Yi Jie. As for one frozen in rigidity, who could bend him? This speaks of the King of Chu.\n\nThus, the sage, by descending, again follows from Gongyue Xiu above.\n\nThe sage comprehends the entangled and obscure, penetrating all as one body, yet unaware of why it is so—this is nature. Returning to the root and reviving the mandate, moving with Heaven as teacher, others then follow and name him thus.\n\nAnxious in knowledge, yet his actions seldom align with the moment—when they come to rest, what then?\n\nEntangled and obscure, only the sage can fully comprehend such matters. Permeating the whole body without exception, yet unaware of why it is so—this is what is meant by nature in its quiescence. Returning to the root and reviving the mandate, in its movement, all stirring and arising accords with Heaven. Others then follow and name him a sage.\n\nAnxious in knowledge, yet his actions seldom align with the moment—this is like the saying that though man’s life does not span a century, he often harbors cares of a thousand years.\n\nOne born beautiful, others offer him a mirror; if not told, he does not know his beauty surpasses others. Whether knowing or not knowing, whether hearing or not hearing, his joy remains unceasing, and others’ fondness for him likewise knows no end—this is nature.\n\nThe sage’s love for others, others bestow upon him the name; if not told, he does not know his love for others. Whether knowing or not knowing, whether hearing or not hearing, his love for others remains unceasing, and others’ contentment in him likewise knows no end—this uses man to illustrate the sage.\n\nAn old state, an old capital—gazing upon them brings unbounded delight. Though hills and mounds, grasses and trees, may fill and block nine-tenths of it, still one feels unbounded delight. How much more when seeing what is seen and hearing what is heard, like a towering terrace suspended amid the throng of musicians?\n\nRan Xiangshi grasped the center of the ring, following completion without beginning or end, without moment or duration. Daily transforming with things, he alone remains untransformed.\n\nUnbounded delight is joy. *Min* means convergence. *Zhòngjiān* refers to the interludes of sheng and yong. The *center of the ring* is the empty space within.\n\nGazing upon an old state or capital, none fail to rejoice. Though grasses and trees converge to block nine-tenths, still one rejoices—how much more when seeing what is seen and hearing what is heard, like a ten-*ren* terrace suspended amid the multitude of musicians? Like Ran Xiangshi, who grasped the principle of its empty center, daily transforming with things yet never transformed.\n\nWould he ever abandon it?\n\nHow could he ever abandon it? *\"Hé\"* means \"how,\" and *\"shě\"* means \"to discard.\" How could he ever ascend to set aside affairs and not engage with them?\n\nThose who model themselves on Heaven yet fail to attain it—both Heaven and things become their sacrifices. In their conduct of affairs, what can be done? The sage has never begun with Heaven, never begun with man, never begun with beginnings, never begun with things. Moving in step with the world without cessation, their actions are complete yet never excessive. In their convergence with the Way, what can be done?\n\nTang found his charioteer, and Menyin Dengheng served as his mentor. Following the teacher without constraint, he attained the principle of following completion. In governing, he oversaw the names of names, and through the law of surplus, both were made manifest. Confucius exhausted his thoughts to serve as his mentor.\n\nThe House of Rongcheng said: \"Remove the days, and there are no years; no inner, no outer.\" Heaven is spontaneity. If one must depart from following it, it is no longer spontaneity. Yet the world contains those who are not at peace with their spontaneity, sacrificing themselves to things. In their conduct of affairs, what can be done? Their actions cannot align with the Dao.\n\nThe sage, however, even dispenses with Heaven—what then remains of man, of beginnings, of things? Though moving in step with the world, it does not hinder or obstruct. Though responding to affairs and engaging with things, their actions are thorough yet never sink into excess. In their convergence with the Dao, what can be done? It is the spontaneity of alignment with the Way.\n\n*\"Liǎng ruò zhī hé\"* refers to the two perspectives. Menyin Dengheng is sometimes said to be Yi Yin. When Tang took Menyin Dengheng as his teacher, he was not confined by rules, succeeding wherever he dwelled. Yet what he achieved was no more than overseeing Tang’s reputation, ensuring Tang’s renown in the world. But reputation is an external surplus beyond one’s true lot—what benefit does it bring to the fundamental? It merely allows others to see both ruler and minister in a favorable light. Yet Confucius and his followers exhaust their thoughts, believing they have transmitted this to the lords of their age.\n\nLater, the words of the House of Rongcheng are cited: \"The reason a year is called a year is because it is named by the accumulation of three hundred and sixty days. Remove the days, and there is no year. If one can eliminate it from the subtlest stirrings of thought, then there is no burden of external names—no inner, thus no outer.\"\n\nWhen Wei Ying made a pact with Marquis Tian Mou, the latter betrayed it. Wei Ying grew enraged and was about to send an assassin. Xishou, hearing of this, found it shameful and said: \"You are a lord of ten thousand chariots, yet you would resort to the ruse of a commoner. Let me receive two hundred thousand armored troops and attack him for you. I will capture his people, seize his cattle and horses, and make his lord’s back burn with inner heat. Then I will take his state. When Ji flees, I will strike his back and break his spine.\"\n\nJizi, hearing this, found it shameful and said: \"To build a wall ten *ren* high, only to tear it down once it reaches ten *ren*—this is the toil of convict laborers. Now, for seven years, no war has arisen. This is the foundation of your rule. Xian is a troublemaker; do not listen to him.\"\n\nHuazi, hearing this, found it disgraceful and said: \"Those who speak well of attacking Qi are troublemakers; those who speak well of not attacking are also troublemakers. Those who say that both attacking and not attacking are troublemakers—*they* are troublemakers as well.\"\n\nThe lord said: \"Then what should be done?\"\nHe replied: \"Seek the Way, and that is all.\"\n\nHuizi, hearing this, went to see Dai Jinren. Jinren said: \"There is a creature called the snail—do you know it?\"\nThe lord said: \"Yes.\"\nJinren said: \"On the left horn of the snail is a state called the House of Chu; on the right horn is a state called the House of Man. They constantly fight over territory, leaving tens of thousands of corpses. After pursuing the routed army for fifteen days, they return.\"\nThe lord said: \"Alas! Is this an empty tale?\"\n\nHe said: \"Allow your servant to make this real for you. Does Your Majesty imagine the four directions and the realms above and below to have limits?\"\nThe lord said: \"They are without limit.\"\nHe replied: \"To know the mind roams in the boundless, yet to return to the states that lie within reach—do they not seem as if they exist, as if they do not?\nThe lord said: \"So it is.\"\nHe continued: \"Within the reachable lies Wei; within Wei lies Liang; within Liang lies the king. Does the king differ from the House of Man?\"\nThe lord said: \"There is no difference.\"\nThe guest departed, and the lord was left in a daze, as if something had been lost.\n\nWhen the guest had gone, Huizi said: \"Blowing through a pipe produces a deep hum; blowing across a sword’s pommel yields but a faint whistle. Yao and Shun are those whom men praise. Yet to speak of Yao and Shun before Dai Jinren is like that faint whistle.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, he lodged at the thatched hut of Ant Mound. His neighbor had a servant and his wife climb to the roof. Zilu said: 'What are those bustling figures doing?'\nZhongni said: 'They are the attendants of a sage. He buries himself among the people, conceals himself at the margins. His voice fades, yet his aspiration knows no bounds. Though his mouth may speak, his heart never truly speaks. He goes against the world, yet his mind disdains to follow it—such is the one submerged in the land.'\nIs this not the Market South’s Yi Liao?\"\n\nZilu requested to go and summon him. Confucius said: \"Let it be. He knows that I am aware of him, knows that I am traveling to Chu, and takes me for one who would surely have the King of Chu summon him. Moreover, he takes me for a flatterer. If that is so, then even hearing the words of a sycophant would shame him—how much more to see him in person? What would he remain for?\" Zilu went to look, and his dwelling was empty.\n\nAnt Mound’s brew-seller was one who sold brew at Ant Mound. *Ascending the ridge* means climbing to the roof beam to gaze afar. *Bustling* means a crowd. *Attendant of a sage* refers to a follower of a sage. *Margins* means borders. *Submerged on land* means dwelling on level ground yet sinking into obscurity, akin to one who hides in the marketplace. \"Is this not Yi Liao of Market South?\" Yi Liao likewise concealed himself in Market South, unknown to others. *What would he remain for* means he would surely flee.\n\nThe Warden of Changwu asked Zilao: \"When governing, do not be reckless; when ordering the people, do not be careless. Formerly, when I cultivated grain, plowing recklessly, the harvest repaid me in kind; weeding carelessly, the harvest repaid me likewise. The following year, I changed my ways, deepened the plowing, and tended it with care. The grain flourished and multiplied, and I was sated for the whole year.\"\n\nZhuangzi, hearing this, said: \"Nowadays, when men cultivate their bodies and order their minds, many resemble what the Warden calls fleeing from Heaven, departing from nature, extinguishing their emotions, losing their spirit, and acting by convention. Thus, those who recklessly treat their nature breed the shoots of desire and aversion, which become the thorns of nature—reeds and rushes. At first sprouting, they seem to support our form, but soon they uproot our nature. When desire and aversion first sprout, one believes they can support our form, only to immediately uproot and disorder our nature. *First* and *soon* echo one another—how laughable to read *reeds and rushes first sprout* as a single phrase! All at once, they burst forth in uncontrolled discharge, erupting as boils, scabies, and sores, with internal heat and oily urine. Such is the consequence of acting by convention.\"\n\n*Thorns* means perverse growths. *Soon* means immediately. *Uproot* means to tear out. *Oily urine* refers to urine containing fatty discharge—all disorders of nature.\n\nBo Ju studied under Lao Dan and said: \"I beg to wander through the world.\" Lao Dan said: \"Enough.\"\n\nThe world remains thus. Bo Ju requested again, and Lao Dan said: \"Where will you begin?\" He replied: \"I will begin in Qi.\"\n\nThere he saw a condemned man—a criminal prisoner. He pushed forward to honor him, and urged him to rise from his emaciation and distress. *Pushed* means to esteem and uphold. *Urged him* means to rouse him from weakness and suffering. Removing his court robes, he covered the man with them, wailed to Heaven, and wept, saying: \"Alas! Alas! The world suffers great calamity, and you alone have been the first to encounter it.\"\n\nHe declared: \"Do not steal. Do not kill.\" (Both *steal* and *kill* read in the departing tone.) \"Only when honor and disgrace are established does one see what brings suffering; only when wealth and property are amassed does one see what sparks strife. Now, you establish what brings people suffering and amass what sparks their strife, exhausting their bodies with unending hardship. Could one hope to avoid reaching this state?\"\n\nThe rulers of old held that success lay with the people, while failure lay with themselves; that uprightness lay with the people, while crookedness lay with themselves. Thus, if even a single person lost their proper form, they would withdraw and take responsibility. Today, it is not so: they conceal their actions to fool the ignorant, magnify difficulties to blame the fearful, impose heavy burdens to punish the incapable, and distance their paths to ensure punishment never reaches them. When the people know their strength is exhausted, they resort to deception to continue. With deception arising daily, how can scholars and commoners not also deceive?\n\nWhen strength is insufficient, one resorts to pretense; when knowledge is insufficient, one resorts to deceit; when resources are insufficient, one resorts to theft. For the acts of theft and robbery, whom can one justly blame?\n\nWhen Qu Boyu reached sixty, he transformed sixty times, never failing to begin with what he deemed right, only to end by condemning it as wrong. How could he know that what he now calls right is not the wrong of fifty-nine transformations past?\n\nAll things have life, yet none see their root; all things emerge, yet none see their gate. People all honor the knowledge of what they know, but none know to rely on the knowledge of what they do not know before attaining true understanding—can this not be called a great delusion?\n\nEnough! Enough!\n\nYet there is no escape from this. Is this what is meant by \"ran\" and \"ping-ran\"? Both \"yu\" and \"hu\" are particles of doubt. This is to say, Qu Boyu believed he knew the errors of his forty-nine years, yet this cannot be called true knowledge.\n\nConfucius questioned the Grand Historian Da□, Bo Changqian, and Xi Wei, saying: \"Duke Ling of Wei indulged in wine and revelry, neglecting the governance of his state; he hunted with weapons, failing to respond to the diplomatic exchanges of the feudal lords. What made him Duke *Ling*?\"\n\nDa Qiang replied: \"It is *because* of this.\" The first *shi* (是) means \"this\"; the second *shi* (是) means \"what people deem right.\" He was posthumously named *Ling* based on what people deemed right.\n\nBo Changqian said: \"Duke Ling had three wives, with whom he bathed promiscuously. Yet when Historian Qiao presented the ceremonial jade, he grasped the silk and supported him with reverence. Though his arrogance was so extreme, his deference to the worthy was so solemn—this is why he was called Duke *Ling*.\"\n\nXi Wei said: \"When Duke Ling died, divination for burial in the ancestral tomb was inauspicious; divination for burial at Shaqu was auspicious. After digging several fathoms, they found a stone outer coffin. Washing and inspecting it, they saw an inscription: *'Do not rely on his son.'* Duke Ling seized and buried it. That he was called *Ling* was long determined. How could these two men understand it?\"\n\n*Tuan* (抟) means \"to grasp\"; *fu yi* (扶翼) means \"to have others assist him.\" *\"Do not rely on his son\"* means his son was untrustworthy.\n\nLittle Knowledge asked Great Master Diao: \"What is meant by 'village words'?\"\n\nGreat Master Diao replied: \"A village combines ten clans and a hundred families to form its customs, merging differences into unity and dispersing unity into differences. Now, if you point to the hundred parts of a horse and cannot obtain the horse, yet the horse stands before you, it is by assembling its hundred parts that you call it a horse. Thus, hills accumulate the lowly to become high; rivers converge waters to become great; the great person unites all to become impartial. Therefore, what enters from without has a master but is not clung to; what emerges from within has a norm but is not resisted. The four seasons have distinct qi, yet Heaven does not bestow favor, and so the year is completed. The five offices have distinct duties, yet the ruler does not act for private ends, and so there is no fame. Without fame, there is non-action; with non-action, there is nothing not done. Time has endings and beginnings; the world has changes and transformations. Fortune and misfortune are substantial, yet what seems adverse may be fitting, and what is pursued may differ in outcome. Those who seek to correct may err. Compared to a great marsh, all materials find their measure; observed in a great mountain, trees and stones share the same ground. This is what is meant by 'village words.'\"\n\n\"The great person unites all to become impartial. Thus, what enters from without has a public Dao as its master and is not clung to; what emerges from within has a public Dao to align with and is not resisted.\" *\"Does not bestow favor\"* means not treating it as a personal favor. *\"Time has endings and beginnings; the world has changes and transformations\"*—one cannot cling to uniformity. *\"Substantial\"* means real. Fortune for the good and misfortune for the excessive are both real principles. What seems adverse may be fitting—like the old man who lost his horse, which may not have been misfortune. *\"Those who pursue may differ in outcome; those who seek to correct may err\"*—people each follow their private inclinations, like faces differing, and in seeking to correct, they may instead go astray.\n\nLittle Knowledge said: \"Then is this sufficient to be called the Dao?\"\n\nGreat Master Diao said: \"No. Now, the number of things is not limited to ten thousand, yet we call them 'the ten thousand things' because we use the term for the greatest number to refer to them. Thus, Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; yin and yang are the greatest of qi; the Dao is their impartiality. To use their greatness to name and refer to them is acceptable, but once a name exists, how can it be compared? If you argue thus, it is like comparing dogs and horses—how far it falls short!\"\n\n\"Once the name of the Dao exists, how can it be compared to other things? If you compare it to other things, it is like using dogs and horses as analogies—it grows ever more distant.\"\n\nLittle Knowledge said: \"Within the four directions, encompassing the six directions, where do the myriad things arise?\"\n\nGreat Master Diao said: \"Yin and yang illuminate and cover each other, govern and succeed one another; the four seasons replace, give birth to, and destroy one another. Desires and aversions, departures and approaches arise in turn. Male and female unite in pairs, and thus there is constant existence. Safety and danger alternate; fortune and misfortune give rise to one another; urgency and leisure rub against each other; gathering and scattering form completion. These are the names and realities that can be recorded, the essences that can be noted. Following the sequence of their principles, the turning of their movements, exhaustion returns to the beginning, and endings return to the start—this is what things possess, what words exhaust, what knowledge reaches, nothing more than the limits of things. The person who perceives the Dao does not follow what is abandoned, nor trace what arises—this is where discussion ceases.\"\n\n*\"Arise in turn\"* means rising prominently. *\"Unite in pairs\"* means separating and joining. *\"Essences that can be noted\"* means recording the subtle and refined. *\"What words exhaust, what knowledge reaches\"*—nothing more than the limits of things. Only the person who perceives the Dao does not follow the endings of things nor trace their beginnings, returning them to nothingness. This is why debate ceases.\n\nLittle Knowledge said: \"Ji Zhen’s 'non-action' and Jie Zi’s 'someone causes it'—which of these two theories accords with reality, and which is biased in its reasoning?\"\n\nGreat Master Diao said: \"Cocks crow and dogs bark—this is what people know. Even with great wisdom, one cannot describe in words the transformations they undergo, nor anticipate in thought what they will do. Analyzing this, the essence reaches the unparalleled, the greatness reaches the unbounded. 'Someone causes it' and 'non-action' cannot escape from things and ultimately err. *Non-action* means there is no one who acts.\"\n\nMencius said: \"That which acts though nothing acts is Heaven.\" The \"someone causes it\" theory holds that something causes things to be so. Mencius said: \"Action is caused by something.\" Thus the two doctrines differ in this way. *Si* (斯) means \"to split apart.\" As the *Odes* says: \"With an axe one splits it; splitting and analyzing it, the subtle reaches the unparalleled, the great reaches the unbounded.\" What the *Odes* calls \"fur still has its patterns\" is surpassed by \"the workings of high Heaven, without sound, without scent\"—this is the ultimate. The theories of \"someone causes it\" and \"non-action\" cannot escape from things and ultimately remain flawed. \"Someone causes it\" is substantive; \"non-action\" is empty. That which has name and substance dwells among things; that which has no name and no substance resides in the emptiness of things. What can be spoken or conceived—speaking of it only increases its remoteness. What has not yet arisen cannot be feared; what has already perished cannot be obstructed. Life and death are not distant, yet their principle cannot be seen. \"Someone causes it\" and \"non-action\" are but suppositions of doubt. Observing their root, their going is without end; seeking their end, their coming is without cease. Without end, without cease—speaking of it is nothingness, sharing the principle of things. \"Someone causes it\" and \"non-action\" are the root of speech, beginning and ending with things. The Dao cannot be possessed; what is possessed cannot be without it. The name \"Dao\" is but a borrowed vehicle for its movement. \"Someone causes it\" and \"non-action\" are but partial aspects of things—how could they encompass the great square? If words suffice, then speaking all day exhausts the Dao; if words do not suffice, then speaking all day exhausts things. The Dao is the ultimate of things; speech and silence cannot contain it. Neither speech nor silence—discourse has its limits. It cannot be feared, nor can it be forbidden.\n\n*The Nanhua True Scripture, Following the Root*, Scroll 24 ends.\n*The Nanhua True Scripture, Following the Root*, Scroll 25\nRecorded by Lu Ling’s Bamboo Peak, Luo Miandao; collated by disciple Peng Xiang.\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: External Things**\n\nExternal things cannot be relied upon—thus Longfeng was executed, Bi Gan slain, Jizi feigned madness, Elai put to death, and Jie and Zhou perished. No ruler fails to desire loyalty from his ministers, yet loyalty does not always earn trust. Thus Wu Yun was cast into the river, Chang Hong died in Shu, his blood concealed, and after three years transformed into jade. No parent fails to desire filial piety from their children, yet filial piety does not always bring love. Thus Xiaoji grieved and Zeng Shen mourned.\n\nWhen wood rubs against wood, it ignites; when metal is held to fire, it melts. When yin and yang clash in their courses, heaven and earth convulse in great turmoil. *Gai* (絯) means \"to bind\"—thus thunder and lightning arise, fire emerges within water, and the great locust tree is consumed. Thunder and lightning are fire within water. Fire from thunder can burn wood, yet only the locust is mentioned, for it is the wood used to kindle fire.\n\nWhen one is deeply troubled yet finds no escape, *chen* (螴) and *dun* (蜳) cannot take form. The heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth, stifled and restless, drowned and knotted. When profit and harm grind against one another, the fire they generate is extreme. The multitude burns away their harmony, and even the moon, inherently yin, cannot withstand the fire’s ascent. Thus the Way collapses utterly.\n\nThis speaks again of the fire within the human heart—how one may be deeply troubled yet find no escape, as in the earlier examples of wood rubbing wood or metal held to fire, yet ultimately unable to flee. For the heart cannot forget profit and harm. *Chen* and *dun* describe insects stirring from hibernation yet still torpid. Affairs fail to come to fruition in this way. When things do not succeed, the heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth, oppressed and agitated, submerged and bound. With these afflictions, profit and harm grind together, and the heart’s fire grows ever more intense—not merely a fleeting flame like fire in water. The multitude, burning away the harmony of their nature, turns even the moon, which belongs to yin, into fire, unable to endure its excess. The subtlety of heaven’s principle cannot withstand the blazing of human desire, and so the Way crumbles and is lost.\n\nZhuang Zhou was poor, so he went to borrow grain from the Marquis of the River. The Marquis replied, \"Very well.\"\n\n\"I shall soon receive the gold from my fief—may I lend you three hundred pieces? Would that be acceptable?\"\n\nZhuang Zhou’s face flushed with anger as he replied: \"Yesterday, as I came, I heard a voice calling from the middle of the road. I turned to look and saw a carp in the rut of a cart wheel. I asked, 'Little carp, what brings you here?' It answered, 'I am a wave-minister of the Eastern Sea. Might you spare a dou or sheng of water to keep me alive?' I said, 'Very well. I am about to journey south to visit the kings of Wu and Yue. I shall divert the waters of the Western River to bring you home—would that do?' The carp’s face darkened with rage. 'I have lost the water that was my constant companion, my accustomed home. I have nowhere to go. A dou or sheng would be enough to keep me alive—just that much. Yet you speak as you do! You would do better to seek me now in the dried-fish market.'\"\n\nMaster Ren cast a great hook with a thick black line, baited with fifty castrated oxen, and crouched on Mount Kuaiji, casting his rod into the Eastern Sea. Day after day he fished, but for a year he caught nothing. Then a great fish took the bait, dragging the massive hook down in a plunge, thrashing its fins until white waves towered like mountains. The sea churned, its roar shaking the earth for a thousand li, as though gods and demons had been unleashed. When Master Ren landed the fish, he butchered and dried it. From the Zhe River eastward and Cangwu northward, none went unsatisfied by its flesh.\n\nYet later generations—those who weigh talent and debate men’s worth, those who recite and parrot what is already settled—all gaped in astonishment and spread the tale. But those who brandish their poles with thin lines, scurry to irrigation ditches, and watch over minnows and carp—how hard it is for them to catch a great fish! Those who adorn petty words to seek high office are as far from true attainment as the sky from the earth. Thus, one who has never heard of Master Ren’s way of life is far indeed from being fit to guide the world.\n\nThe Confucians rob graves with *Odes* and *Documents* in hand. A great Confucian calls down from above: \"Dawn breaks in the east—how goes the work?\" A lesser Confucian replies, \"The skirt and jacket are not yet removed, but there is a pearl in the mouth.\" The *Ode* says: *Green grows the wheat, / upon the mound it springs. / In life he gave no alms— / why hold a pearl in death?* They seize the corpse’s temples, press its cheeks, and with a metal mallet pry open the jaw, carefully working from the side to split the flesh without damaging the pearl in the mouth.\n\nThey even compose poems about grave-robbing Confucians, from *\"Green grows the wheat\"* to *\"Do no harm to the pearl in the river.\"* If one takes these as poems of only four lines, the rest must be the great Confucian’s instructions.\n\nA disciple of Lao Lai was gathering firewood when he encountered Confucius. Returning, he reported: \"There is a man over there—tall above, narrow below, slightly hunched, ears set back. His gaze seems fixed on the four seas. I do not know whose son he is.\" Lao Lai said, \"That is Qiu. Summon him.\" When Confucius arrived, Lao Lai said, \"Qiu, cast off your bodily pride and your cultivated knowledge—then you may be called a noble man.\" Confucius bowed and withdrew, his expression troubled. He asked, \"May I advance in my work?\" Lao Lai replied, \"To bear the wound of a single generation and yet act heedless of ten thousand generations’ peril—is this not stubborn poverty? Or have you simply failed to consider the consequences? To curry favor with delight is to court lifelong disgrace—this is but the conduct of the common crowd. Men lead one another by reputation, bind one another with obscurity. Rather than praise Yao and condemn Jie, it would be better to forget both and close the door on such judgments. To turn back is to invite harm; to act is to risk error. The sage hesitates to initiate affairs, yet each endeavor succeeds. Why, then, do you persist in your pride? Tall above’ means a long upper body; ‘narrow below’ means slender legs—said to be three inches shorter than Yu’s. ‘Slightly hunched’ means a slightly curved back. ‘Ears set back’ means they are not visible when viewed from the front. ‘Bodily pride’ is self-importance; ‘cultivated knowledge’ is polishing one’s appearance to seek recognition. ‘Heedless’ means acting without regard. ‘Heedless of ten thousand generations’ peril’ means acting as though one’s choices have no lasting consequences. ‘Stubborn’ is a turn of phrase: *Are you so stubbornly poor as to do this? Or have you simply failed to think it through?* ‘To curry favor with delight’ means flattering others to win their affection, unaware that this invites calamity for generations. Thus it is said: *To curry favor with delight is to court disaster.* Though you may see this as delight, it is lifelong disgrace—nothing more than the conduct of the common crowd, advancing no further. Men lead one another by reputation, bind one another with obscurity—nothing more.\"\n\nConcealment is obscurity. Confucius often praised Yao and condemned Jie, so his teaching went: *Rather than laud Yao and denounce Jie, better to forget both praise and blame—indeed, to dispense with praise altogether.* To act contrary to this principle is to invite harm; to act recklessly is to invite perversity.\n\nThe sage undertakes affairs with hesitation, as though compelled, and thus invariably succeeds. *Carrying out* means *acting.* How could it be otherwise? If one persists in such pride to the end, this is a warning against such persistence.\n\nDuke Yuan of Song dreamed in the dead of night of a man with disheveled hair peering through the side gate. Beside the gate, he said: *I come from Zailu’s deep abyss, where I am known as the Luminous One. I serve as the emissary of the Clear River to the River Lord. The fisherman Yu Qiu caught me by surprise.* The duke awoke and had the dream interpreted. The diviner said: *This is a spirit-turtle.* The duke asked: *Is there a fisherman named Yu Qiu?* His attendants replied: *There is.* The duke said: *Summon Yu Qiu to court.*\n\nThe next day, Yu Qiu appeared. The duke asked: *What did you catch?* He replied: *My net snared a white turtle, five feet in circumference.* The duke said: *Present your turtle.* When the turtle arrived, the duke wavered—first wanting to kill it, then to spare it. Unsure, he consulted the oracle, which said: *Slay the turtle for divination—it will be auspicious.* So they split the turtle open, drilling seventy-two times without a single miscast.\n\nConfucius remarked: *The spirit-turtle could appear in Duke Yuan’s dream yet could not escape Yu Qiu’s net. It could endure seventy-two divinations without error yet could not avoid the disaster of having its entrails carved out. Thus, even wisdom has its limits, and spirit its inadequacies. Though one may possess supreme knowledge, it is best to consult the many.*\n\nFish do not fear nets but fear pelicans. Discard petty cleverness, and great wisdom becomes clear; abandon contrived goodness, and true goodness arises. A newborn babe, though untaught by any master, learns to speak—simply by dwelling among those who can. Even with supreme knowledge, one does not compare to consulting the many. Fish fear pelicans, not nets—this is the fish’s ignorance. They know the pelican can harm them, yet the net comes from where they least expect. Little do they realize that the pelican’s harm is small, while the net’s is great.\n\nWhen a person discards petty cleverness, great wisdom becomes clear; when one ceases to pride oneself on goodness, true goodness arises naturally. Like a babe who learns speech without a master—simply by dwelling among speakers. Even the wise should consult the many.\n\nHui Shi said to Zhuangzi: *Your words are useless.* Zhuangzi replied: *Only when one understands uselessness can we speak of use. The earth is vast and great, yet what man uses is only enough to stand on. But if you dug beneath your feet to the Yellow Springs, would the ground still be of use?* Hui Shi said: *It would be useless.* Zhuangzi said: *Then the usefulness of the useless is clear.*\n\n*To place the feet* means *to set them down.* *To sink* means *to fall through.* Zhuangzi said: *If a man can wander freely, how could he not wander? If a man cannot wander, how could he wander at all?* Those with *drifting aspirations* and *decisive actions*—alas, are these not beyond the capacity of the supremely wise and profoundly virtuous? They plunge headlong without turning back, rush like fire without a glance behind. Though they may serve as ruler and minister for a time, when the age changes, they will no longer hold sway over one another. Thus it is said: *The perfected person does not linger in their actions.*\n\nTo honor the past and disparage the present is the way of scholars. If we observe the present age through the lens of the Xuwei clan, who could avoid being swept along? Only the perfected person can wander through the world without bias, adapting to others without losing themselves. They do not study others’ teachings, yet align with their intent without opposition.\n\n*To wander* means to float freely between heaven and earth, moving with the world without conflict. Is there one who can wander yet chooses not to? Or one who cannot wander yet does? Some can, some cannot. The following speaks of those who *drift* and *sever ties*—those who cannot wander—while the perfected person can.\n\n*Drifting aspirations* means indulging desires without restraint, forgetting to return. *Decisive actions* means acting with absolute resolve, beyond persuasion. Alas, these are not the province of the supremely wise and profoundly virtuous. For when wisdom is perfected, one does not drift; when virtue is profound, one does not sever ties. Such people, like one teetering on the edge of a precipice, do not retreat; like fire spreading unchecked, they do not look back. Though they may submit as ministers for a time, when the age changes, they no longer hold authority—all distinctions of rank vanish.\n\nHaving spoken of what is not good, let us speak of what is. Consider the ancient sage-kings like the Xuwei clan: in this present age, people follow the current, honoring their own rulers and no longer mentioning the Xuwei. Only the perfected person can bend yet wander through the world without bias or eccentricity. Though they adapt to others, they do not lose themselves. They do not study others’ teachings, yet align with their intent without opposition—like the debates of the Confucians and Mohists, following nature as though no division exists.\n\nEyes that penetrate are called *bright*; ears that penetrate are called *keen*; noses that penetrate are called *sensitive*; mouths that penetrate are called *discerning*; minds that penetrate are called *wise*; wisdom that penetrates is called *virtue.* The Dao does not tolerate blockage—blockage leads to choking, and if choking persists, it leads to trampling, from which a multitude of harms arise.\n\nLiving things rely on breath, yet if it is not abundant, it is not heaven’s fault. Heaven bores through them day and night without cease, yet man clogs their openings. *Sensitive* means *responsive.* *Penetrate* means *unobstructed.* The ears’ unobstructedness is *keenness*; the eyes’, *brightness*; the nose’s unobstructedness allows it to sense qi, causing the head to *quiver.* *Choking* means *obstructing the throat.* *Trampling* means *being trodden upon*—like feet unsteady in walking, as though trampled by others.\n\nThe three yin meridians of the foot all originate from the toes and ascend along the throat—is this not so? Qi flows through the channels and collaterals; thus, if choking persists unchecked, it transforms into foot ailments. Once foot ailments arise, a multitude of harms follow—not merely choking and trampling.\n\nThis illustrates that the Dao must not be obstructed; obstruction breeds afflictions of this kind. *Abundant* means *flourishing*. It is further said that sentient beings rely on the free circulation of breath to sustain this body. If their breath is not flourishing, it is not heaven’s doing. Heaven bores through human orifices, and qi circulates day and night without cease. Yet man himself clogs his own apertures. *Descend* means *to sink downward*. The breath within the human body all rises from below; if it descends without ascending, death ensues. This analogy of breath serves to illustrate the heart.\n\nThe *bao* (womb/bladder) has layered chambers; the character *gen* (艮) lacks a dot, signifying that the heart possesses *heavenly wandering*. If a chamber has no emptiness, then mother and daughter-in-law quarrel within; if the heart has no heavenly wandering, then the six senses contend. The great forests and towering mountains seem virtuous to men only because their spirits are unequal to them.\n\nVirtue overflows into fame, and fame overflows into ostentation. Schemes deepen through contention; barriers arise from clinging to office. Affairs are settled by the consensus of the many. In spring’s timely rains, grasses and trees burst forth in growth, and only then do the tools of cultivation—hoes and plows—begin their work. Yet more than half of the plants that are *inverted* (planted upside down) thrive unknowingly.\n\n*Chonglang* refers to layered thresholds, like the empty spaces within the *bao*. The *bao* has layered thresholds, while the heart possesses heavenly wandering. If a chamber has no emptiness, then mother and daughter-in-law are pressed together before one’s eyes. For when a chamber has empty space, mother and daughter-in-law may dwell in ease. If the heart lacks heavenly wandering, the six senses vie for dominance. Yet if the heart has a place for natural wandering, do passions and desires not contend?\n\nLikewise, when men behold great forests and mountains and deem them virtuous, it is because their minds are narrow and their spirits cannot match them. If one’s spirit were sufficient to meet them, why would one praise them?\n\nVirtue resides within, yet fame causes it to overflow; fame itself is colorless, yet ostentation causes it to overflow. *Overflow* is like water spilling beyond its bounds. Schemes, though originally without deep calculation, grow more entrenched through the desire to entice others. *Chai* (barriers) follows the meaning of *chai zha* (palisades) from the *Nei Tian Di* chapter. It refers to the fortified posts where officials stand guard, erecting palisades for defense. Palisades do not naturally arise in official precincts; affairs are not inherently fixed but are resolved by what the multitude deems fitting—all depart from the natural.\n\nFor example, in the season of spring rains, grasses and trees naturally flourish, yet only then do men sharpen their hoes and plows, harming growth and contravening nature. *Inverted* means *reversed*. Stillness can remedy illness; *zi* (目病, eye ailments) can ease aging; tranquility can halt haste. Yet these are the concerns of the toiling, not the idle who have never inquired; they are what startle the world, yet the spirit-like man has never inquired; they are what startle the state, yet the worthy man has never inquired.\n\nIn Yanmen, when a man’s kin died, he was appointed an official for his skill in mourning. Half his fellow villagers followed his example and mourned themselves to death. *Yanmen* was the name of a village. *Official* here means *leader*.\n\nWhen Yao offered the world to Xu You, Xu You fled; when Tang offered it to Wu Guang, Wu Guang grew angry. When Ji Ta heard of this, he led his disciples to crouch by the Kuai River, and the feudal lords came to offer condolences. Three years later, Shen Tu Di drowned himself in the Yellow River.\n\nThe *quan* (basket trap) is for catching fish, yet once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten; the *ti* (snare) is for catching hares, yet once the hare is caught, the snare is forgotten; words are for conveying meaning, yet once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. Where might I find a man who has forgotten words, that I might speak with him?\n\n*The Twenty-Fifth Scroll of the Circulating Edition of the Southern Florescence True Scripture Concludes*\n*The Twenty-Sixth Scroll of the Circulating Edition of the Southern Florescence True Scripture*\n\nLulu Bamboo Peak’s Luo Miandao, as recorded by his disciple Peng Xiang, collates and punctuates:\n\n*Miscellaneous Chapters: Parables*\n\nParables make up nine-tenths, weighty words seven-tenths, and goblet words emerge daily, harmonized by the Heavenly Boundary.\n\nA *parable* is speech by borrowed authority.\n*Weighty words* are speech spoken with solemnity.\n*Goblet words* are speech like wine poured in celebration.\n\n\"Nine-tenths\" and \"seven-tenths\" mean that nine or seven parts out of ten are so.\n\"Emerge daily\" means that such words arise day after day, not merely nine or seven parts out of ten.\n\nParables, nine-tenths of all, rely on external discourse.\nA loving father does not act as matchmaker for his own son.\nIf the father praises him, it is not as convincing as if someone else did.\nIt is not my fault—it is the fault of others.\nWhen something aligns with oneself, one responds; when it does not, one resists.\nWhat aligns with oneself is deemed right; what differs is deemed wrong.\n\nA loving father does not act as matchmaker for his son because he cannot recommend or advance him.\nA father cannot praise his own son; he must rely on others to praise him.\nThis shows that words spoken by oneself are not trusted; only when borrowed from others do people begin to believe.\nYet this borrowing is not my fault—it is the fault of others.\nPeople only favor what aligns with themselves and dislike what differs.\nThus, my words will not be believed, leaving no choice but to borrow authority.\n\nWeighty words, seven-tenths, serve to express one’s own speech.\nThese are the words of elders, whose years come first.\nYet if one lacks the warp and weft of beginnings and ends, merely counting years to claim elder status, this is not true precedence.\nIf one cannot surpass others, one lacks the Way of humanity.\nOne who lacks the Way of humanity is called a \"worn-out person.\"\n\nWeighty words are meant to end disputes, and such solemn speech must come from those of mature experience.\nPeople respect those called elders, yet true elders are not merely those whose years come first.\nIf one’s years come first but one’s words lack structure and coherence, merely relying on advanced age to claim seniority, this is not true precedence.\nWhat makes one surpass others is the ability to fulfill the Way of humanity.\nIf one cannot fulfill the Way of humanity, then despite long years, one is but a long-lasting, useless person.\n\nGoblet words emerge daily, harmonized by the Heavenly Boundary, flowing and extending to exhaust the years.\nWithout speech, all is equal.\nEquality and speech are not equal; speech and equality are not equal.\nThus it is said: \"Speak no words.\"\nTo speak of \"no words\" is to speak all one’s life yet never have spoken;\nTo never speak all one’s life is to never have failed to speak.\n\nThere is a source from which something is permissible, and a source from which it is not;\nThere is a source from which something is so, and a source from which it is not.\n\nWhence comes \"so\"? \"So\" is so in its being so.\nWhence comes \"not so\"? \"Not so\" is not so in its being not so.\nWhence comes \"permissible\"? \"Permissible\" is permissible in its being permissible.\nWhence comes \"impermissible\"? \"Impermissible\" is impermissible in its being impermissible.\n\nThings inherently have that which makes them so; things inherently have that which makes them permissible.\nYet there is nothing that is not so, nothing that is not permissible.\nWithout goblet words emerging daily, harmonized by the Heavenly Boundary, who could attain such enduring constancy?\n\nAll things are seeds, succeeding one another in different forms, beginning and end like a ring—none can grasp their order. This is called the Heavenly Equality.\nThe Heavenly Equality is the Heavenly Boundary.\n\nThose who have already seen the \"Equalizing Things\" chapter need no further redundant explanation.\n\nWithout speech, things naturally equalize; with speech, right and wrong arise in confusion, and equality is lost.\nThis is why equality and speech, speech and equality, are all unequal.\n\n\"Speak no words\"—to speak of \"no words\" is speech without words, without any verbal expression.\nIt is like music without sound.\nIf one speaks all one’s life yet fails to transform others, such speech is as if non-existent—this is to never have spoken.\nIf one never speaks all one’s life yet others are naturally transformed, then though one does not speak, it is as if one has taught them—this is to never have failed to speak.\n\nIs it permissible or not? Is it so or not so?\n\nThough all things have their origins, how can I claim to know them?\nI but affirm what is affirmed, approve what is approved—nothing more.\nThings inherently possess their own \"thusness\" and \"rightness,\" their own \"approval.\"\nI too deem nothing not thus, nothing not permissible.\n\nIt is not that the goblet words emerge daily, harmonizing with Heaven’s Boundary—how else could they endure without contention?\nThe character \"enduring\" (久) corresponds to \"daily emergence\" (日出).\n\nExpanding further: all things under Heaven share a single root, born of the Supreme Ultimate, the two qi, and the Five Phases—only their forms differ.\nIn truth, this principle and this qi alternate through expansion and contraction, waxing and waning, succeeding one another in an endless cycle without discernible order.\nThis is what is called Heaven’s Equality.\n\"Equality\" means sameness.\nWhy insist on disputing right and wrong?\n\nHeaven’s Equality is precisely Heaven’s Boundary, for its initial signs were already thus.\nZhuangzi said to Huizi: \"Confucius lived sixty years, and in sixty years he transformed. What he once deemed right, he later deemed wrong. Who knows whether what he now calls right is not what he deemed wrong at fifty-nine?\"\nHuizi replied: \"Confucius toiled his will and pursued knowledge.\"\nZhuangzi said: \"Confucius has renounced such things, though he never spoke of it.\nConfucius said: 'One receives one’s endowment from the Great Root and restores one’s numinous essence to life. When one sings, it accords with the pitch-pipes; when one speaks, it accords with the law. Profit and righteousness are set before one, yet likes and dislikes, right and wrong merely subdue people’s mouths. To make people submit in their hearts and dare not raise a contrary word, to establish a standard and settle the world’s settled—enough, enough! How could I ever reach such a one?'\"\n\n\"Pursuing knowledge\" means laboring in the pursuit of knowledge.\n\"Endowment\" is as Mencius said: \"Heaven’s bestowed endowment.\"\n\"The Great Root\" is the Great Origin.\n\"Restoring the numinous\" means the human heart is empty and numinous, yet obscured by material desires—restoring it returns it to its original state.\n\"Contrary\" (蘁) means opposition.\n\"Settling the world’s settled\" means the world has its own settled principles; one merely settles what is already settled.\n\nWhen Huizi heard Zhuangzi say Confucius transformed at sixty, he thought Confucius merely toiled his will and pursued knowledge, failing to achieve true transformation.\nZhuangzi said: \"Not so. Confucius said: 'One receives one’s nature from the Origin and returns to one’s empty numinosity. In life, when one sings, it accords with the pitch-pipes; when one speaks, it accords with the law. Profit and righteousness are set before one, yet one knows only likes and dislikes, right and wrong—this is the work of the Confucians, merely subduing people’s mouths. As for making people submit in their hearts and dare not oppose, this alone is the Way of the Perfected Person.' He then praised him, saying: 'Is the Way limited to this? Is it limited to this? How could I ever reach such a Perfected Person?'\"\nAll from \"enough, enough\" onward are Confucius’ words.\n\nMaster Zeng served twice, and his heart transformed twice. He said: \"When I first served to provide for my parents, three *fu* brought me joy; later, when I served, three thousand *zhong* were not enough, and my heart grieved.\"\nA disciple asked Confucius: \"Can Zeng Shen be said to have no attachments?\"\nConfucius said: \"He already has attachments. How could one without attachments feel sorrow?\"\nTo him, three *fu* and three thousand *zhong* were like watching sparrows, mosquitoes, and gnats pass before him.\n\"Attachments\" (縣) means entanglements.\n\n\"To say he had 'no entanglements in his transgressions' means that Zeng Shen’s service to his parents could be called utmost filial piety, with no fault to be found. Confucius said: 'His transgressions are already exposed. How could one without fault be moved to sorrow by grief? To him, three *fu* and three thousand *zhong* were like sparrows, mosquitoes, and gnats passing before him—what merit is there to speak of! Three thousand *zhong* were as sparrows, three *fu* as mosquitoes and gnats.'\n\nYan Chengzi You said to Dongguo Ziqi: 'Since I heard your teachings, in the first year I became rustic; in the second, I followed; in the third, I penetrated; in the fourth, things came to me; in the fifth, they arrived; in the sixth, spirits entered; in the seventh, Heaven was completed; in the eighth, I knew neither death nor life; in the ninth, I attained the Great Mystery.\nIn the first year, I returned to simplicity; in the second, I knew where to enter; in the third, nothing was beyond my reach; in the fourth, all things served me; in the fifth, they came as I summoned; in the sixth, spirits and gods drew near; in the seventh, I became one with Heaven; in the eighth, neither life nor death could move my heart; in the ninth, the divine mystery was unfathomable.'\n\nLife (生, pronounced as *qù* in *yǒuwéi*) is death. The passage exhorts Lord Gong that death has its causes, while life is yang and has no cause. Is this truly so? Where does one go? Where does one not go?\n\n*Quàn* (勸) means to exhort. *Gōng* (公) refers to the deceased. *Zì* (自) means 'cause'—the living act with purpose, while the dead are exhorted thus: Lord Gong believed death must have a cause, such as illness or execution, all brought about by human agency, whereas life arises naturally from yang qi, not by human effort. Is this teaching truly so? Where should one follow? Where should one not?\"\n\nHeaven has its celestial reckonings, earth has its human □—where should I seek them? None know where it ends; how then can there be no fate? None know where it begins; how then can there be fate? When there is resonance, how can there be no spirits? When there is no resonance, how can there be spirits?\n\nThose who discourse on Heaven speak of the laws of celestial reckonings. As for Earth, there are the traces of human investigation □. Are these truly sufficient to exhaust the principles of Heaven and Earth? Where should I seek them?\n\nHumans cannot be certain of their ultimate ends—wealth or poverty, nobility or baseness, long life or early death—how can one be sure there is a governing power? How can one say there is no fate? Yet at the moment of bestowal, who truly enacts it? How can one say there is fate? When good fortune befalls the virtuous and calamity the wicked, there is resonance—how can one say there are no spirits? Yet when Yan [Hui] dies young and Zhi [the Robber] lives long, there is no resonance—how can one say there are spirits? These are all words meant to awaken the deceased.\n\nThe crowd of *wangliang* spirits asked the Shadow: \"Before, you bowed your head; now, you raise it. Before, your hair was bound; now, it is loose. Before, you sat; now, you stand. Before, you walked; now, you stop. Why is this?\"\n\nThe Shadow replied: \"Why do you, old one, ask such trifling questions? I act, yet I know not why. I am like the cicada’s molted husk, the snake’s sloughed skin—seemingly so, yet not so. Fire and sunlight are my gathering; yin and night are my succession. That—do I depend on it? How much more so those who depend on what depends! When it comes, I come with it; when it goes, I go with it. When it is strong and yang, I am strong and yang with it. What question is there in strong yang?\"\n\n*Kuo* means bound hair. *Sou* is a term for an old man. *Shao* means \"slightly.\" *Bi* refers to form. *Kuang hu* is used for emphasis.\n\n\"Strong yang\" refers to qi of the yang that is not upright.\n\nThe relationship between *wangliang* and shadow is like that of an old man to another old man. When two old men meet in this world, how much time do they have to question one another? It is but a trifling moment. Why must you ask even slightly?\n\n\"I\" refers to the shadow speaking of itself. Though I possess this shadow, I know not why it is so. Thus, one might say the shadow is born of form, like the cicada’s husk or the snake’s sloughed skin—this explanation seems so, yet is not. The husk still belongs to the cicada; the sloughed skin still belongs to the snake. But the shadow? When fire and sunlight shine upon it, it gathers. When yin and night descend, it departs. Without fire or sunlight, even with form, there can be no shadow. From this, it is clear that form, though it may give rise to my shadow, must depend on something. How much more so *wangliang*, which relies on what depends! When form comes and goes, I come and go with it. When form is strong and yang, I am strong and yang with it. Yet strong yang is not the true essence of blood and qi, and the shadow that follows it to manifest form is likewise unreal—what question is there to ask?\n\nThis passage repeats earlier words yet surpasses them in subtlety, refining the old man’s analogy. The depth of this elder’s mind is boundless; one cannot say it falls short of the Inner Chapters.\n\nYang Ziju journeyed south to Pei, while Lao Dan traveled west to Qin. They met by chance at the outskirts of Liang. Midway, Laozi looked up to the heavens and sighed, saying: \"At first, I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.\" Yang Ziju made no reply. Upon reaching their lodging, he brought water for washing, a towel and comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: \"Earlier, your disciple wished to ask you, Master, but you were walking without pause, so I dared not. Now that you have paused, I beg to know my fault.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Your haughty and overbearing demeanor—with whom could you dwell? The purest white appears tainted; the greatest virtue seems insufficient.\"\n\nYang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: \"I humbly receive your instruction.\"\n\nOn his departure, the innkeeper and his household came to greet him. The inn’s master held the mat, his wife the towel and comb; the guests stepped aside from their seats, and the cook left the hearth. On his return, the innkeeper vied with him for a seat.\n\nHaving heard Laozi’s words, Yang Ziju deeply restrained and humbled himself, withdrawing into obscurity, so that others no longer scrutinized him.\n\nNow, following Su Shi of the Eastern Slope’s interpretation, I have removed the four chapters *Yielding the Throne*, *Robber Zhi*, *Discoursing on the Sword*, and *The Old Fisherman*, and appended *Lie Yukou’s* encounter with Bohun Wuren in Qi while returning mid-journey, merging them into a single parable.\n\nSu Shi’s *Record of the Zhuangzi Shrine* states: \"One may doubt whether *Robber Zhi* and *The Old Fisherman* truly slander Confucius, while *Yielding the Throne* and *Discoursing on the Sword* are shallow and far from the Dao. Upon repeated reading, I discerned their allegorical intent, concluding with: 'Yang Ziju traveled west to Qin and met Laozi. On his departure, the innkeeper and his household came to greet him—the master held the mat, his wife the towel and comb; the guests stepped aside from their seats, and the cook left the hearth. On his return, they vied with him for a seat.' Removing the four chapters *Yielding the Throne*, *Discoursing on the Sword*, *The Old Fisherman*, and *Robber Zhi*, I merged this with *Lie Yukou’s* return mid-journey to Qi, saying: 'I was startled. I dined at ten broth-sellers’ stalls, and five served me first.' Then I understood and laughed: 'This was indeed one chapter.' Those who fail to grasp Zhuangzi’s words to the end merely splice them into his text.\"\n\nLie Yukou was traveling to Qi when he turned back midway and encountered Bohun Wuren. Bohun Wuren asked: \"Why have you returned?\"\n\nHe replied: \"I was startled.\"\n\n\"Startled by what?\"\n\n\"I once dined at ten broth-sellers’ stalls, and five served me first.\"\n\nBohun Wuren said: \"If so, why be startled?\"\n\nHe replied: \"When inner sincerity is unresolved, outward demeanor gleams with false brilliance, overawing others’ hearts, causing them to slight the venerable and esteemed and to focus on their concerns. 'Inner sincerity unresolved' means one cannot attain emptiness within. 'Outward demeanor gleams with false brilliance' means one cannot rest in tracelessness. Outwardly, one may spy and craft a radiant display, thus becoming an object of scrutiny. 'To slight the venerable and esteemed' means one does not inquire whether others possess the Dao but merely honors them for their age and seniority. *Ni* means 'fermented' or 'aged.' 'Their concerns' refer to abandoning one’s natural state to engage in external deference, which is deemed wearisome. The broth-sellers merely peddle food and surplus goods; their profit is meager, their influence slight. Yet even they act thus—how much more so the lord of ten thousand chariots? He labors for the state and exhausts his knowledge in affairs. They will entrust me with tasks and demand results. That is why I was startled.\"\n\nBohun Wuren said: \"Well observed! Now that you have settled yourself, others will protect you.\"\n\nShortly after, he went to visit, and the shoes outside the door filled the entrance. \"Protect you\" means others will gather to shelter him. The *Annals of Han* records that Xiao and Cao feared crossing the city to protect the High Ancestor—its meaning is the same.\n\nBohun Wuren stood facing north, firmly planting his staff and pressing it against his chin until his skin wrinkled. After standing for a while, he departed without a word. The attendant informed Liezi, who rushed barefoot, clutching his shoes, and reached the gate, saying: \"Master, since you have come, have you no remedy to offer?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Enough! I already told you: 'Others will protect you'—and now they do. It is not that you can make others protect you, nor can you prevent them from doing so. What use is there in this?\"\n\nThe marvels of foreknowing arise from responsiveness. There must be a stimulus, and when shaken, one’s fundamental nature emerges. *Yu* means \"not yet.\" *Cai* may also be written as *xing* (nature). The responsiveness to what has not yet come to pass is what gives rise to the extraordinary. The verification of the multitude lies in the certainty of some stimulus, which then stirs one’s inherent nature. Yet this too is meaningless.\n\nAmong those who wander with you, none will tell you. Even those who keep your company will not inform you of this. Those who speak petty words are all poison to others. Petty words are clever, insinuating speech. When such petty words exist, they become harm to others. None awaken, none comprehend—why question one another? What is there to ask?\n\nThe cunning toil and the wise worry; the incapable seek nothing. They eat their fill and roam freely, drifting like an untethered boat, empty and wandering. There was a man of Zheng named Huan who recited and murmured in the land of Qiu. After just three years, Huan became a Confucian. His influence moistened the land for nine *li*, and his beneficence extended to his three clans, even prompting his younger brother to study Mohism.\n\nThe Confucians and Mohists debated, and their father sided with Mo Di. After ten years, Huan took his own life. In a dream, his father said to him: \"The one who made your son a Mohist was I. Why did you never once regard him favorably? Now I have become the fruit of the cypress on the grave.\" The Creator’s repayment to man does not repay the man himself but repays the Heaven within him—that which made him so. Yet man, believing himself to possess something that sets him apart from others, thereby demeans his kin.\n\nThe people of Qi who drew water from the well fought and grappled with one another. Thus it is said: All in the world today are like Huan. From this, even those with virtue find the Creator’s repayment unknowable—how much more so for those with the Dao? The ancients called this \"the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.\"\n\nMurmuring refers to recitation. \"Just three years\" means that in just three years, his Confucian studies were complete. \"The river moistens nine *li*\" is a metaphor for his beneficence extending to his three clans, meaning his official salary as a Confucian brought blessings to his lineage. \"Prompting his brother to study Mohism\" means he supported his brother in learning Mo Di’s teachings. *He* means \"why.\" *He hu* is an emphatic expression meaning \"why ever.\" In the dream, he told his father: \"The one who led your son to study Mohism was I. Yet you never once looked upon him with favor. Now I have died and become the fruit of the cypress and cedar on the grave.\"\n\nZhuangzi cited this story and concluded: The Creator’s repayment to man does not stoop to repaying what the man has done but often repays what he could not do. Huan, however, demanded repayment for his actions—this was his error. The Creator truly made his brother a Mohist, yet Huan resented it. By demeaning his kin, he was like the people of Qi who, when drawing water from the well, fought and grappled over something that belonged to no one. Those who seize and drink merely fight among themselves—this is ignorance of Heaven. All people today are like Huan.\n\nFrom this, it follows that even those with virtue find the Creator’s repayment unfathomable—how much more so for those with the Dao? Those with the Dao entrust everything to nature. The ancients called Huan’s kind \"those who flee from the punishment of Heaven.\"\n\nThe sage finds peace in what is naturally peaceful and does not seek peace in what is not; the multitude seeks peace in what is not peaceful and does not find peace in what is. These few lines suffice to convey Huan’s lack of peace.\n\nZhuangzi said: To know the Dao is easy; to refrain from speaking of it is hard. To know and not speak is to follow Heaven. To know and speak is to follow man. The ancients followed Heaven, not man.\n\nZhu Pingman studied dragon-slaying from Zhi Liyi, exhausting a thousand pieces of gold from his family. After three years, his skill was perfected, yet there was no use for his dragon-slaying craft—this too was following man.\n\nThe sage takes what must not be as what must not be, thus having no weapons. The multitude takes what must not be as what must be, thus having many weapons. Yielding to weapons, they act with ulterior motives. Weapons, when relied upon, lead to ruin—this is not following Heaven but man.\n\nThe petty man’s knowledge does not extend beyond bribes and memoranda. He exhausts his spirit in trivial and shallow matters, yet wishes to universally save the Dao and things, to unify form and emptiness. Those like this are lost in the cosmos, burdened by form and unaware of the Great Beginning.\n\n\"To universally save\" refers to the Dao and things; \"to unify\" refers to form and emptiness. It is like saying \"to achieve perfect balance.\" \"Burdened by form and unaware of the Great Beginning\" means being shackled by form and ignorant of the Great Beginning.\n\nThe perfected person returns their spirit to the beginningless and delights in deep slumber in the land of Nothing Whatever. Like water flowing without form, they release and disperse into the Great Purity. Alas! You take knowledge to reside in the tip of a hair yet do not know the great tranquility. The perfected person is like water, without intent. \"Knowledge in the tip of a hair\" is petty knowledge.\n\nThere was a man of Song named Cao Shang who was sent by the King of Song as an envoy to Qin. On his departure, he obtained several carriages. The king was pleased with him and added a hundred more carriages. Upon returning to Song, he saw Zhuangzi and said: \"Living in a cramped alley, impoverished and weaving sandals, with a withered neck and sallow face—this was my shortcoming. But to awaken a ruler of ten thousand chariots and follow him with a hundred carriages—this is my strength.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: The King of Qin had an illness and summoned physicians. Those who lanced boils and drained abscesses received one carriage; those who licked his hemorrhoids received five carriages. The lower the treatment, the more carriages they received. Did you perhaps treat his hemorrhoids? Why else would you receive so many carriages? Be on your way!\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Yan He, saying: \"I take Zhongni as the pillar of the state—will the kingdom then recover?\"\n\nYan He replied: \"Perilous indeed! It teeters on the brink.\n\n\"Zhongni adorns feathers to make patterns—patterns, pronounced *hua*, meaning ornate embellishments—adorns feathers to create such ornamentation. He busies himself with florid rhetoric, taking branch for root, spinning fragmented theories. He hardens his nature to display it to the people, yet does not know his own lack of sincerity. He receives it in the heart and governs it with the spirit—how could this suffice to lead the people? Man is born receiving this heart, with the spirit as its natural master. Yet Zhongni forcibly seeks to control it—how could this suffice to govern the people? *Fu* refers to Zhongni.\n\n\"Those people—you and I—ought to let them be, guided only by our bearing. Even if there are errors, it would suffice. Now you cause the people to abandon substance and learn falsity—this is no way to lead them. *Bi* refers to the people; *ru* to you, Duke; *yu* to myself, Yan He. *Yi* means direction, as in a nod or gesture. *Wu* means error. The people should be left to forget themselves; you and I need only guide them with our bearing—why impose governance? Though there may be some mistakes, it is better than forcing them into falsity.\n\n\"Considering the future, it would be better to cease. The state is difficult to govern. What is bestowed upon men yet not forgotten is not the natural dispensation of Heaven. If you take Zhongni as the pillar, you plan for future generations—better to desist, for the kingdom is hard to rule. What is given to men yet cannot be forgotten is not a natural bestowal.\n\n\"Merchants are not ranked among the gentry. Though circumstances may occasionally place them there, the spirit does not accept it. The heart does not wish to rank them so—*chi* means to rank. Yan He’s displeasure with Zhongni is thus.\n\n\"External punishments are meted out by metal and wood; internal punishments arise from movement and transgression. When petty men incur external punishments, metal and wood interrogate them; when they incur internal punishments, yin and yang consume them. Only the true person can escape both inner and outer punishments.\" Here Yan He expounds the Way of the true person, drawing a clear distinction from Zhongni.\n\nConfucius said: \"The human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to know than Heaven. Heaven has its seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer—and its fixed times of day and night. But man has a thick façade and deep emotions. Thus, some appear honest yet seek gain; some seem incapable yet possess talent; some are compliant yet sharp, or stubborn yet yielding; some are slow yet severe. *Hu* is read as *han*, *gan*—though firm, they are circuitous; though unhurried, they are harsh. Therefore, those who rush to righteousness as if parched may flee from it as if burned.\"\n\nThus, the noble person tests them from afar to observe their loyalty, tests them at close hand to observe their reverence, burdens them with tasks to observe their ability, suddenly questions them to observe their knowledge, sets urgent deadlines to observe their trustworthiness, entrusts them with wealth to observe their benevolence, warns them of danger to observe their integrity, intoxicates them with wine to observe their restraint, and mingles them in company to observe their demeanor. When all nine tests are complete, the unworthy are revealed.\n\nZheng Kaofu, upon his first appointment, bent low; upon his second, stooped; upon his third, bowed deeply, and crept along the wall—who would dare transgress? But such a man as this, upon his first appointment, puffed up with pride; upon his second, danced atop his carriage; upon his third, called his elders by name. Who could compare to Tang Xu? Zheng Kaofu’s conduct is recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. \"Such a man\" refers to the common sort. \"Danced atop his carriage\" means he danced with arms outstretched while riding. \"Called his elders by name\" means he addressed his seniors familiarly. Tang Xu refers to Xu You of the era of Emperor Yao. Xu You declined the empire and would not accept it—how could he be arrogant on account of rank? Who could truly match him?\n\nNo greater thief exists than virtue held with intent, and intent with an eye—once it has an eye, it turns inward; turning inward, it is undone. Five baleful virtues exist, and the central virtue is chief among them.\n\nWhat is the central virtue? The central virtue is one who takes self-satisfaction and reviles those who do not act as they do. The desires of the ear, eye, nose, mouth, and heart—these five are all baleful virtues, yet the heart’s desire, being central, is the chief of baleful virtues. Whoever takes self-satisfaction and reviles others for not doing as they do—this is baleful virtue.\n\nPoverty has eight extremes; success has three certainties. The two—poverty and success—are expounded below. \"Certainties\" means inevitabilities.\n\nThe body has six receptacles. Beauty, whiskers, height, stature, strength, splendor, courage, and boldness—these eight surpass others, yet by these one is impoverished. (Beauty and whiskers, height and stature are one; strength and splendor, courage and boldness are one. When Viscount Xiang of Zhao deemed a man with fine whiskers and great stature worthy, or one skilled in archery and charioteering worthy, these too were two matters.) Combining the six receptacles into eight, one is impoverished by what surpasses others—this further explains the eight extremes of poverty.\n\nCompliance, ease, and humility—these three all lead to success. Compliance means following the natural course; ease means acting with self-possession; humility means falling short of others through timidity and fear. These three do not seek success, yet success comes of itself—this explains the three certainties of success.\n\nWisdom that extends outward brings resentment when boldness stirs; benevolence and righteousness bring reproach. Only one who grasps the essence of life acts with towering self-assurance. One who grasps knowledge, though not reaching this, may still resemble it. One who grasps the great mandate of Heaven moves in accord with it; one who grasps the lesser mandate, though unable to match this, may still accept what befalls them. What is called success does not lie in acting outwardly.\n\nA man who had an audience with the King of Song was granted ten carriages. With these ten carriages, he grew arrogant toward Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi said: By the river lived a poor family who wove rushes to eat. Their son dived into the depths and obtained a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. His father said to him: Bring a stone to smash it! For a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces must lie in the ninefold abyss beneath the chin of a black dragon. That you could obtain it means you encountered its sleep. Had the black dragon awakened, what trace of you would remain?\n\nNow the depths of the state of Song are not merely a ninefold abyss; the King of Song is not merely a black dragon. That you could obtain the carriages means you encountered his sleep. Had the King of Song awakened, you would be reduced to dust.\n\nArrogance means haughty condescension, treating others as children. Weaving rushes means crafting implements from grass. \"What trace would remain?\" means the dragon would devour him, leaving nothing.\n\nSomeone sent an envoy to Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi replied to the messenger: Have you seen the sacrificial ox? It is clothed in embroidered silk and fed with fine grain. Yet when it is led into the great temple, though it might wish to be a lone calf, can it be so?\n\nAs Zhuangzi neared death, his disciples wished to give him a lavish burial. Zhuangzi said: I take heaven and earth as my inner and outer coffins, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars as my pearls, and the ten thousand things as my funeral gifts. Are my burial furnishings not complete? What could be added to this?\n\nHis disciples said: We fear the crows and kites will eat you.\n\nZhuangzi said: Above, I would be eaten by crows and kites; below, by ants and mole crickets. To take from one to give to the other—how partial is that!\n\nTo level with the uneven is to fail in leveling; to verify with the unverifiable is to fail in verification. Only the enlightened act, and the spiritually attuned verify. That the enlightened cannot surpass the spiritually attuned has long been so. Yet fools rely on what they see to impose upon others—this external effort is truly lamentable.\n\n*Verification* means proof.\n\n*Following the Original Text of the Southern Florescence True Scripture*, Scroll 26\n(Note: The character \"门\" in the original was emended to \"问\" following the received text.)\n(Note: The character \"汝\" was added following the received text.)\n\n*Following the Original Text of the Southern Florescence True Scripture*, Scroll 27\nRecorded by Luo Miandao of Luling Bamboo Peak; collated by disciple Peng Xiang.\n\nThe world abounds with those who practice the arts of governance—each deeming their methods unsurpassable. These are the *arts of branches*, where each clings to what they possess, believing none can exceed them.\n\nWhat was called the *Dao-arts* in antiquity—the arts of the Way—transcends these branch-arts. Where, then, does it reside? It is nowhere absent. How does the spirit descend? How does clarity emerge? The sage is born of it, the king is perfected by it—all trace back to the One, the Great Ultimate.\n\nUnsevered from the Source, one is a *Heavenly Person*; unsevered from essence, a *Spiritual Person*; unsevered from truth, a *Perfected Person*. Taking Heaven as their source, virtue as their root, and the Dao as their gate—this encompasses the Heavenly, Spiritual, and Perfected Persons.\n\nManifesting through transformation, one is a *sage*. Taking benevolence as grace, righteousness as principle, ritual as conduct, and music as harmony—this defines the sage. Radiant with compassion, one is a *noble person*. Taking law as division, names as standards, deeds as proof, and scrutiny as judgment—counting one, two, three, four—officials rank themselves thus. Taking duty as constant, sustenance as primary, fostering growth, storing provisions, caring for the aged, weak, orphaned, and widowed—this is the governance of the people. This describes the ranking of noble persons.\n\nFrom the Heavenly Person to the noble person, the Dao-arts of antiquity are fully encompassed. Yet what follows laments the divergence of past and present.\n\nThe ancients were complete: they matched the spirit’s brightness, harmonized with Heaven and Earth, nurtured the myriad things, brought concord to the world, and extended blessings to the people. They understood the fundamental principles and adhered to their applications, their influence pervading all—great and small, refined and coarse—with no place untouched.\n\nWhere their clarity was bound to measures and degrees, remnants of old laws and transmitted histories still endure. In the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, scholars of Zou and Lu, and the gentry, often elucidate them. The *Odes* convey intent, the *Documents* convey affairs, the *Rites* convey conduct, the *Music* conveys harmony, the *Changes* convey yin and yang, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* convey names and duties. These principles, scattered across the world and established in the Central States, are sometimes praised and expounded by the Hundred Schools.\n\nThis describes the Dao-arts of antiquity, encompassing Fuxi, Shennong, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Kings Wen and Wu, the Zhou, and Confucius. Yet when the world fell into great disorder, worthies and sages lost their clarity, and the Dao and virtue diverged. The world grasped at partial insights, each prizing their own. Like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth—each has its clarity but cannot communicate—so too the Hundred Schools’ arts each have their strengths and occasional uses. Yet they are incomplete, partial—scholars of a single corner.\n\nThey dissect the beauty of Heaven and Earth, analyze the principles of the myriad things, and examine the wholeness of the ancients. Few can fully embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the countenance of the spirit’s brightness. Thus, the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship dimmed and remained unexpressed, and the world’s people each pursued their desires, crafting their own methods. How lamentable!\n\nThe Hundred Schools departed and did not return—they will never reunite. Later scholars, unfortunate to have missed the purity of Heaven and Earth and the greatness of the ancients, saw the Dao-arts torn asunder by the world.\n\nThe world’s great disorder stems from partial insights—each grasping one aspect and delighting in their own bias. Like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth, each has its knowledge but cannot communicate. The Hundred Schools’ arts each have their strengths and occasional uses, yet they cling to partiality. Few, in examining the ancients’ wholeness, can fully embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the spirit’s countenance. Each crafts their own methods—how lamentable!\n\nNot indulging in later ages, not lavishing on the myriad things, not flaunting measures and degrees, but using the carpenter’s line to correct themselves and prepare for the world’s urgencies: this was a path within the ancient Dao-arts. Mo Di and Qin Guli heard its teachings and rejoiced in them. They overemphasized it, yet followed it to excess.\n\nThey composed the *Against Music*, calling it *Frugality*; they forbade singing in life and mourning in death. Such was the ancient Dao-arts, yet Mo Di’s followers alone delighted in these teachings, carrying them to extremes.\n\nThose who correct themselves with the carpenter’s line do so to an extreme degree. Their insistence on neither extravagance nor ostentation, neither excess nor display, is itself an extreme of compliance. In composing *Against Music*, they declare all their undertakings to be devoid of joy. Mozi advocated universal love and mutual benefit while opposing strife, and his Way forbade anger. He was diligent in study and broad in learning, yet neither aligned with the ancients nor diverged from the common crowd—his path neither matched the ancient kings’ nor differed from the multitude’s. He condemned the rites and music of antiquity: the Yellow Emperor had *Xianchi*, Yao had *Dazhang*, Shun had *Dashao*, Yu had *Daxia*, Tang had *Dahu*, King Wen had the music of the *Biyong* academy, and King Wu and the Duke of Zhou composed *Wu*—these were the music of old. In ancient funeral rites, noble and base had their proper forms, high and low their distinctions. The Son of Heaven was buried in seven layers of inner and outer coffins, the feudal lords in five, ministers in three, and scholars in two—these were the rites of old. Yet Mozi alone forbade singing in life and mourning attire in death, prescribing only a paulownia coffin three inches thick with no outer casket as the model. Teaching others thus, he showed no love for them; practicing it himself, he showed no love for himself. Though his Way had not yet failed, instructing others in meagerness was hardly a way to love them. Yet in his own conduct, he embraced meagerness, surely showing no love for himself. Thus, none could fault him, and his Way did not collapse.\n\nNevertheless, to sing yet condemn singing, to weep yet condemn weeping, to rejoice yet condemn rejoicing—is this truly fitting? Though what follows are Zhuangzi’s critical remarks: to refrain from singing when one ought to sing, to refrain from weeping when one ought to weep, to refrain from joy when one ought to rejoice—does this accord with human nature? His life was one of toil, his death one of meagerness; his Way was stark and unadorned, causing others sorrow and grief. His conduct was difficult to emulate. I fear it cannot be the Way of the sage, for it runs counter to the hearts of all under Heaven. The world cannot endure it. Though Mozi alone could bear it, what could he do for all under Heaven? Estranged from the world, he was far from the kingship of old. This is how he diverged from the ancient kings.\n\nMozi spoke of the Way, saying: \"In ancient times, Yu dammed the floods, dredged the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and opened the roads to the four barbarians and the nine provinces. There were three hundred great rivers, three thousand tributaries, and countless smaller streams. Yu personally wielded the basket and spade, the tools for carrying food and clothing, and dredged the myriad rivers of the world. His calves bore no flesh, his shins no hair; he bathed in harsh rains, combed through fierce winds, and established the ten thousand states. Yu was a great sage, yet he wearied his body for all under Heaven to such an extent. Thus, later Mohists wore coarse garments of fur and hemp, bound their feet in rough sandals, labored day and night without rest, and took self-imposed hardship as their ultimate principle, saying: 'Without this, one cannot follow Yu’s Way and is unworthy of being called a Mohist.'\"\n\nXiangli Qin’s disciples, such as Xiangli (a surname), Qin (a given name), and the followers of the Five Lords (the five ranks of feudal lords, as in the *Zuozhuan*),...\n\nThe southern Mohists—Ku Huo, Ji Chi, Deng Lingzi, and their ilk—all recited the *Mo Jing* yet diverged in their interpretations, calling themselves \"separate Mohists\" of distinct lineages. They engaged in debates over the \"hard and white\" and \"same and different,\" responding to one another with asymmetrical, unorthodox arguments—neither clashing nor contradicting, yet aligning in their discourse. They revered the *Juzi* as sages, each aspiring to serve as their proxy, hoping to become their successors. This dispute remains unresolved to this day.\n\nThe *Juzi*—akin to \"great ones\"—were chosen from the most eminent of their faction as sages. To serve as their proxy (*shi*, \"master\") was to become the lineage’s standard-bearer. Yet while some believed in this, others did not, and the debate has never been settled. Mo Di and Qin Guli’s intentions were sound, but their methods were flawed. They would have later Mohists vie in self-imposed hardship, boasting of calves without flesh and shins without hair. This is the height of chaos, the nadir of order—where disorder abounds and governance is scarce. Nevertheless, Mozi was truly one who loved the world and sought its betterment. Even if one were to seek such a figure in vain, they would persist, undeterred by emaciation—a true talent indeed. Unburdened by convention, unadorned by material things, uncompromising with others, and unyielding to the crowd, he desired the world’s peace to preserve the lives of the people. His own sustenance and that of others were to be met in full measure, and no more—thus baring his heart to make its purity known.\n\nAmong the ancient arts of the Dao, some resided in this approach. Song Xing and Yin Wen, hearing of its influence, were delighted. They crafted the \"Mount Hua cap\" as their emblem—its shape flat above and below, symbolizing balance. They engaged with all things by first distinguishing right from wrong, for bias obscures judgment. They spoke of the heart’s capacity, naming it \"the heart’s conduct.\" Through harmony, they sought to unite the world, proposing to establish it as the guiding principle. To describe the heart’s capacity was to depict its form; to name it was to define its function. *Er* (cooking to tenderness) was likened to fostering harmony, as one might prepare a feast to bring joy, thereby pacifying the realm. They urged that this principle be made the master of all.\n\nUnmoved by insult, they sought to quell strife and end warfare, rescuing the people from conflict. With this, they traversed the world, persuading rulers above and instructing the masses below. Though the world rejected them, they persisted, clamoring without cease—thus, though reviled above and below, they forced their presence. Yet their concern for others was vast, while their self-regard was minimal. They declared: \"Five *sheng* of rice suffice. The master may fear hunger, but though disciples starve, they never forget the world, laboring day and night without rest. They say: 'We must surely bring life to all!'\"\n\nWould they truly take pride in being saviors of the world? They declared: \"Five *sheng* of rice suffice.\" Yet the master feared hunger, and disciples, though starving, followed without respite, day and night. They said: \"We must surely bring life to the people!\" Would they take pride in those saviors of the world who do not give their all?\n\nThey said: \"The noble person is not overly scrupulous, nor does he lend himself to things. To deem something of no benefit to the world is to make clear that it is not as good as oneself.\" They took the prohibition of attack and cessation of warfare as external matters, and the restraint of passions and desires as internal. Whether great or small, refined or coarse, their conduct extended precisely to this point and no further. Though their learning differed in scale and depth, their conduct sufficed to reach this end. Thus, their words held no distinction of great or small, high or deep.\n\nImpartial yet not partisan, level and without bias, detached and without fixed intent, they followed things without duality, unburdened by deliberation, unguided by cunning. Toward things, they made no selection, but went along with them. \"Level\" means even and unobstructed. \"Detached and without fixed intent\" means meeting affairs with decisive action, without preconceived notions. \"Following things without duality\" means responding to matters without divided intentions. For instance, if one were engaged in a task and another generated a separate intention, this would be a sign of contrivance.\n\nAmong the ancient arts of the Dao, there were those who practiced this way. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard of its influence and delighted in it. They took the equalization of the myriad things as their foremost principle, saying: \"Heaven can cover them but cannot bear them; earth can bear them but cannot cover them; the great Dao can encompass them but cannot discriminate among them. Know that the myriad things all have what is acceptable and what is not.\"\n\nThus they said: \"Selection is not comprehensive; teaching does not reach all; only the Dao leaves nothing out.\" Therefore, Shen Dao abandoned knowledge and relinquished the self, acting only out of necessity. He was unencumbered by things, taking this as the principle of the Dao. He said: \"To know yet feign ignorance is to approach knowledge only to be harmed by its proximity.\" If one makes selections, they will not be comprehensive; if one uses this as teaching, it will not reach all. Only by returning to the Dao can nothing be lost.\n\n\"Unencumbered\" (*ling*) means clarity and coolness; \"detached\" (*tai*) means purification and cleansing. To be \"unencumbered and detached by things\" is to act with ease in all affairs. \"To know yet feign ignorance\" means that though one knows, one acts as if one does not. Both \"approach\" (*bo*) and \"proximity\" (*lin*) imply slightness—if one has even a slight knowledge, one will inevitably suffer slight harm.\n\nPeng Meng, Tian Pian, Shen Dao, Hui Shi, and Deng Xi were all contemporaries of King Xuan of Qi, residing at Jixia. Their learning was rooted in the Huang-Lao tradition. (See *Yin Wenzi* and *Xunzi*.)\n\nThey mocked the world’s esteem for worthies, indulging in unrestrained conduct without adherence to standards, and denounced the world’s great sages.\n\n\"Chui\" (椎, pronounced like *chui* in \"hammer\") and \"pai\" (拍) imply bending; \"wan\" (輐, pronounced *zhí* in \"straight tube\" and *duàn* in \"sever\") implies brevity—both adapt to things without contention. To \"hammer\" is to strike, to \"sever\" is to cut, yet both yield without resistance. Abandoning right and wrong, one may thus avoid entanglement.\n\nWithout reliance on wisdom or foresight, unaware of what lies ahead or behind, one stands towering and alone. Pushing others to turn back before proceeding, dragging one’s steps before advancing—like the swirling return of a whirlwind, the circling of a feather, the grinding of a millstone in its groove—one remains whole without fault, moving or still without transgression, never incurring blame.\n\nThe whirlwind’s return, the feather’s circling—both suggest yielding. The millstone’s groove, too, turns and emerges without resistance. Why is this so? For things devoid of knowledge bear no burden of self-assertion, no encumbrance of cleverness; their movement and stillness never depart from principle, and thus they pass their lives without praise.\n\nThus it is said: \"Attain the state of things without knowledge, and the worthies and sages become superfluous.\" A clod of earth does not lose the Dao.\n\nThe heroic and eminent mocked him, saying: \"Shen Dao’s Way is not the conduct of the living but the principle of the dead.\" They found it merely strange.\n\nA clod, devoid of knowledge, does not lose the Dao. Yet the heroic and eminent laughed among themselves: \"What Shen Dao practices is not the way of the living but the principle of the dead.\" They could only marvel in bewilderment.\n\nTian Pian was the same, having studied under Peng Meng and received the teaching of \"no-teaching.\" Peng Meng’s master said: \"The ancient Dao reaches the point where nothing is affirmed, nothing denied.\" Its manner was utterly still (*kuòrán*), beyond all description.\n\nYet even so, he could not escape the fate of being \"cut off like a turtle\" (*yuán duàn*). What he called the Dao was not the Dao, and what he spoke as right was not free from wrong.\n\nPeng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not understand the Dao. Nevertheless, in broad terms, they had once glimpsed something of it.\n\n\"Tian Pian was the same\" means he was like Shen Dao. Peng Meng was Tian Pian’s teacher. Tian Pian studied under Peng Meng and received the teaching of \"no words.\" Peng Meng’s master had said: \"The ancient Dao reaches the point where nothing is affirmed, nothing denied.\" Its manner was so obscure (*lùwǎngrán*) as to be inexpressible, and thus Peng Meng, too, remained silent.\n\nYet when Tian Pian returned from Peng Meng’s house, after some time, people no longer gathered to watch—though a few still came, like fish breaking the surface in scattered succession. Though his words did not astonish, some still recognized him.\n\nFrom this, we may conclude: what Tian Pian called the Dao was not the Dao, and even if his words were right, they were not free from wrong.\n\nZhuangzi assessed them, saying: \"Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao cannot be credited with understanding the Dao, yet viewed broadly, they had once heard something of it.\"\n\nZhuangzi, taking Lao Dan as one who understood the Dao, thus compared them to this passage. \"Taking the root as essential, the material as coarse; regarding accumulation as insufficiency, one dwells in serene solitude with the spirit luminaries.\"\n\nAmong the ancient arts of the Dao, there were those who embodied this. Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of their manner and delighted in it. They established it upon the constancy of \"non-being\" (*wúyǒu*) and centered it in the Great One (*Tàiyī*). They took gentleness, weakness, and humility as its outward form, and emptiness, non-destruction of the myriad things as its substance.\n\nGuan Yin said: \"Within oneself, hold no fixed position, and the forms of things will manifest of themselves. In movement, be like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. Fading like vanishing, silent like purity—harmonizing with those who are alike, giving life to those who attain it. Never preceding others, always following them.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Know the masculine, keep to the feminine, and be the world’s stream. Know the bright, keep to the obscure, and be the world’s valley.\" (Obscurity here means darkness; streams and valleys are empty yet capacious places—metaphors for the Mysterious Female (*Xuán Pìn*).)\n\n\"While others seek to be first, I alone take the rear,\" he said. \"I bear the world’s filth. While others seek fullness, I alone take emptiness. Without hoarding, I have abundance—abundance in tranquility. In conducting myself, I am unhurried and unburdened, acting without contrivance and laughing at others’ cleverness.\n\nWhile others seek fortune, I alone seek to bend and preserve wholeness, saying: 'Let me merely avoid blame.' Taking depth as my root, frugality as my guiding principle, I say: 'What is rigid will break; what is sharp will be blunted.' Always yielding to things, never cutting others down—this may be called the ultimate attainment.\n\nAh, Guan Yin and Lao Dan! Were they not the vast and true persons of antiquity? Silent and formless, their transformations without constancy—do they belong to death or life? Do they stand with heaven and earth?\"\n\nWhere does the spirit’s radiance go? Vast and boundless—whither does it drift? Sudden and fleeting—where does it alight? All things are gathered within it, yet none can claim it as their home.\n\nAmong the ancient arts of the Dao, there was one that dwelt herein. Zhuang Zhou heard its wind and delighted in it. With meandering discourse, wild and unbounded words, and speech without beginning or end, he gave free rein to his thoughts without constraint, refusing to be confined by partial views—meaning he would not be limited to a single perspective. He saw the world as sunk in turbidity, unfit for solemn speech or direct instruction. Thus, he used *zhi*-words to weave expansive tales, *zhong*-words to affirm truth, and *yu*-words to broaden his reach. Alone, he roamed with the spirit of heaven and earth, yet did not scorn or detach from the myriad things. He did not dispute right or wrong, but dwelt among the common world.\n\nThough his writings were grand and wondrous, their flow was harmonious and unmarred. Though his words were uneven and strange, they were striking to behold. Zhuangzi himself marveled at his own prose. His fullness could not be contained. Above, he wandered with the Creator; below, he befriended those beyond life and death, without beginning or end. In his grasp of the root, he was vast and expansive, profound and unrestrained. In his reverence for the source, he attained perfect harmony and ascended to the heights—this source being the unbroken lineage of the Dao.\n\nYet though he responded to transformation and dissolved the constraints of things, his principles were inexhaustible, his insights unchanging. Vague and obscure, they remained unfathomed.\n\nZhuangzi followed the teachings of Lao Dan. Since Lao Dan had already been praised as a vast and true person, what more could Zhuangzi add? Thus, the final passage merely addresses his writings.\n\nHui Shi was a man of many methods—contemporary with Zhuangzi as minister of Liang. While earlier passages spoke of the arts of the Dao, here alone they speak of \"many methods,\" referring to the arts of disputation. His writings filled five carts; his doctrines were contradictory and discordant; his words did not strike the mark.\n\nIn his *Discourse on Things*, he said: \"That which is greatest, having no outside, is called the Great One; that which is smallest, having no inside, is called the Small One. What has no thickness cannot be accumulated, yet it may extend a thousand *li*. The sky and earth are level; mountains and marshes are flat. The sun is at its zenith even as it declines; things are born even as they die. If great things are the same while small things differ, this is called the lesser sameness and difference. If all things are entirely the same or entirely different, this is called the greater sameness and difference.\"\n\nHis words did not align with reason, yet he proceeded to ponder the nature of things. He said: \"What has no thickness cannot be accumulated, yet its greatness may span a thousand *li*—for from the infinitesimal, accumulation may reach vastness. As for the sun’s decline, it may be observed aslant. The sky and earth, mountains and marshes—all share in the sun’s ascent and descent. The birth and death of things are likewise united in sameness. If great things are alike while small things differ, this is the lesser sameness and difference. If all things are entirely the same or entirely different, this is the greater sameness and difference.\"\n\n\"The south is both boundless and bounded. Today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday. Linked rings can be unlinked. I know the center of the world—it lies north of Yan and south of Yue. Embracing all things with universal love, heaven and earth become one body.\"\n\nHui Shi took this as his great principle, surveying the world to enlighten its debaters. The debaters of the world rejoiced in his company.\n\nThose who dwell in the north know nothing of the south’s geography and deem it boundless—yet in truth, it has limits. Though one may set out for Yue today, upon arrival, it is as if one had come yesterday. The center of the world is unknowable—yet the people of Yan and Yue each take their own land as the center, so the north of Yan and the south of Yue may also be deemed the center. To embrace all things with universal love is to make heaven and earth one body with oneself.\n\nEggs have feathers. A chicken has three feet. Ying possesses all under heaven. A dog can be a sheep. Horses lay eggs. A tadpole has a tail.\n\nFire is not hot. Mountains speak. Wheels do not touch the ground. Eyes do not see. The finger does not reach, and what reaches does not persist. A tortoise is longer than a snake. The carpenter’s square is not square; the compass cannot draw a circle. The socket does not encircle the tenon. The shadow of a flying bird never moves. The swiftness of an arrow’s flight includes moments of neither motion nor rest. A dog is not a hound. A yellow horse and a black ox make three. A white dog is black. A lone colt has never had a mother. If you take half of a one-foot staff each day, it will never be exhausted for ten thousand generations.\n\nDebaters used these propositions to engage with Hui Shi, and their exchanges continued endlessly. This passage records several such paradoxes of the time.\n\nFeathers grow within the egg—hence, \"eggs have feathers.\" A pheasant has two feet, but the intent behind its movement counts as a third—hence, \"a chicken has three feet.\" Ying was originally a state ruled by a marquis, yet it was called a kingdom—hence, \"Ying possesses all under heaven.\" The names of large and small sheep are assigned by people; if one first names a dog as a sheep, then people will call it a sheep. Horses are certainly born from the womb, yet since a foal is covered in hair at birth, how is it different from being born from an egg? Not only do creatures have tails—observe the characters for \"hook\" (钩), \"ding\" (丁), and \"child\" (子), all of which resemble tails. Xunzi also said, \"Hooks have bristles; eggs have feathers\"—these are difficult claims to uphold. Yet Deng Xi and Hui Shi could defend them. The commentary explains: \"Hooks having bristles\" is akin to \"a tadpole having a tail,\" for the curved part of *ding* (丁) forms a hook, and bristles resemble tails.\n\nFire is hot, yet in winter it is not. Mountains are still, yet an echo in an empty valley makes them \"speak.\" A perfectly round wheel does not touch the ground. The *Kao Gong Ji* states of wheelwrights: \"When inspecting a wheel, one desires it to be so smooth that no part stands out—this is the essence of roundness.\" Eyes may be obstructed and thus fail to see; a finger may miss its target and thus fail to reach. Even a straight path cannot be fully traversed. Snakes are long, yet tortoises are short—but since tortoises can foretell fortune, they are \"longer\" than snakes. The carpenter’s square is a tool for making right angles, yet its own form is not perfectly square. The compass is a tool for drawing circles, yet its own form cannot create a perfect circle. The socket is not designed to encircle the tenon—rather, the tenon fits into it. Though the shadow of a flying bird appears to move, it merely clings to the bird’s form and does not separate from it—hence, it \"never moves.\" Though an arrow flies swiftly, if it is not loosed, it does not move; once loosed, it cannot be stopped—thus, its swiftness lies in the archer, not the arrow itself.\n\nA dog and a hound are the same, yet one with dewclaws is called a *hound*, while one without is merely a *dog* and cannot be called a hound. A horse is one, yet there is also the category of \"yellow\"—that makes two. If the horse is inherently yellow, and people call it so, does that not make three? The same applies to a black ox. A black dog cannot become white, but a white dog can be dyed black—thus, one may say a dog can be called a \"black colt.\" Yet to say a \"lone colt\" implies it never had a mother—is this acceptable? A one-foot staff is not long, yet if you use half of it today and half of the remainder tomorrow, repeating this endlessly, it will never be exhausted for ten thousand generations.\n\nDebaters of the time used such arguments to engage with Hui Shi, their exchanges continuing without end. Huan Tuan, Gongsun Long, and their ilk—these sophists—distorted people’s minds and altered their intentions. They could triumph in verbal sparring but could not win over hearts; such was the confinement of the debaters. Hui Shi daily matched wits with others, setting himself apart from the world’s debaters with his strangeness—this was his root. Yet in his oral disputations, he considered himself the most worthy, declaring: \"Are not heaven and earth grand? I, Hui, possess a heroic spirit but lack the method.\" The confinement of the debaters refers to how none could escape the bounds of their own arguments. Ordinary debaters are common people; the world’s debaters transcend the ordinary, like those called the \"worthies of the world.\"\n\nThe root here means foundation. Hui Shi daily engaged in debate with ordinary people, but when he suddenly confronted Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long, he was pitted against the world’s debaters—was this not strange? His position was like the tangled roots of a tree, difficult to uproot. Yet in his speech, he boasted: \"Is my strength not like that of heaven and earth? How could others surpass heaven and earth?\" Such was his delusion. Though Hui Shi harbored a competitive spirit, he lacked the means to prevail. He began with many methods but ended with none—thus, he had neither method nor principle.\n\nIn the south there was a man of extraordinary talent named Huang Liao, who asked why heaven and earth do not collapse, and the causes of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. Hui Shi did not decline to answer nor pause to reflect but expounded on all things without end. Though his explanations were exhaustive, he still deemed them insufficient and added ever more bizarre claims, taking contrarian positions as truth and seeking fame through victory—thus, he found no harmony with others. Weak in virtue yet strong in disputation, his path was tortuous. \"Weak in virtue\" means deficient in moral power; \"strong in disputation\" means excessive in argumentation. *Tu* means path; *yu* means winding. Hui Shi’s way was circuitous and crooked.\n\nViewing Hui Shi’s abilities through the Dao of heaven and earth, he was like the labor of a single mosquito or gnat—what use was he to the world? Even if one’s partial theories were sound, to claim they were the most esteemed Dao would be perilous. Hui Shi could not find peace in this, scattering his efforts across all things without satisfaction, seeking only fame as a skilled debater. He could not settle into unity but instead sought to encompass all things, flaunting his ability.\n\nAlas! Hui Shi’s talents, though expansive, could not attain even the smallest gain. Chasing after the myriad things without return—this is like exhausting echoes for sound, like form racing alongside shadow. How lamentable!\n\nHui Shi said, “Heaven and earth are indeed grand!”—thus this passage speaks of the Way of heaven and earth. But how could Hui Shi truly comprehend it? In the closing section of his work, Zhuangzi thoroughly rebukes Hui Shi, making clear his disdain for the strategists of the Warring States. The final chapter recounts the arts of the Way: first the Heavenly Person, the Spirit Person, and the Perfect Person; then the Sage and the Noble Person. Only after the arts of the Way fragmented in later ages did the various schools diverge. Hui Shi’s methods are placed last of all.\n\nZhuangzi ranked himself after Lao Dan, never daring to claim superiority over the Six Classics. Having read thus far, could there be any chapters remaining? *The True Classic of Southern Florescence* concludes with this, the twenty-seventh scroll. *The True Classic of Southern Florescence*, twenty-eighth scroll. Recorded by Luo Miandao of Zhufeng in Luling; collated and punctuated by his disciple Peng Xiang. *Rejecting the False, Cultivating Sincerity*.\n\nCultivating Sincerity and Restoring Nature are shallow and clumsy. The four chapters beginning with *Yielding the Throne* are coarse and harsh. These are not the authentic words of Zhuangzi; they are rejected and appended to the end of the scroll.\n\nThose who *cultivate sincerity* exalt conduct, distancing themselves from the world and defying custom, their lofty discourses filled with resentment and reproach—this is but obstinacy. Such are the preferences of recluses in the mountains and valleys, men who are not of this world, those who delight in withering away or plunging into the abyss. Those who speak of benevolence and righteousness, loyalty and trust, reverence and frugality, deference and yielding—this is but refinement. Such are the preferences of gentlemen in peaceful times, teachers and admonishers, those who roam and dwell in the love of learning. Those who speak of great achievements, establishing great renown, honoring ruler and subject, rectifying high and low—this is but governance. Such are the preferences of courtiers, men who exalt their lord and strengthen the state, those who seek merit and annexation. Those who retreat to marshes and wilds, dwelling in seclusion, fishing and living idly—this is but inaction. Such are the preferences of men of rivers and seas, those who shun the world, those who delight in leisure. Those who practice breath control, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, imitating the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching—this is but longevity. Such are the preferences of practitioners of Daoist arts, those who nurture the body, those who seek the long life of Peng Zu.\n\nYet there are those who attain loftiness without cultivating sincerity, refinement without benevolence and righteousness, governance without merit and fame, seclusion without rivers and seas, longevity without Daoist arts. They forget nothing, yet possess all. Serene and boundless, all beauties follow them. This is the Way of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the Sage.\n\nThus it is said: Tranquility, stillness, emptiness, and non-action—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the essence of the Way and virtue. Thus it is said: When the Sage rests in ease, he is level and yielding. Being level and yielding, he is tranquil. Tranquil and level, cares and troubles cannot enter, perverse qi cannot assail. Thus his virtue is whole and his spirit unharmed.\n\nThus it is said: The Sage’s life is the movement of Heaven; his death is the transformation of things. At rest, he shares the virtue of yin; in motion, he moves with the waves of yang. He does not precede fortune nor initiate misfortune. He responds only after being stirred, moves only when pressed, rises only when compelled. He discards knowledge and precedent, following the principle of Heaven. No heavenly disasters, no burdens from things, no human reproach, no blame from spirits. His life is like floating; his death is like repose. He does not ponder nor scheme. Radiant yet not dazzling, trustworthy yet not bound by expectation. In sleep, he does not dream; awake, he has no worries. His spirit is pure and unadulterated; his soul does not weary. Emptiness and tranquility—only thus does he accord with the virtue of Heaven.\n\nThus it is said: Sorrow and joy are perversions of virtue; delight and anger are excesses of the Way; likes and dislikes are lapses of virtue. Therefore, a heart without sorrow or joy is the perfection of virtue; unity without care is the perfection of stillness; nothing to oppose is the perfection of emptiness; nothing to resist is the perfection of purity.\n\nThus it is said: When the body labors without rest, it breaks down; when essence is used without cease, it wearies; weariness leads to exhaustion. The nature of water is such that when unadulterated, it is clear; when undisturbed, it is level. If pent up and unmoving, it cannot remain clear—this is the image of Heavenly virtue.\n\nThus it is said: Pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, serene and non-active, moving in accord with Heaven’s course—this is the Way of nurturing the spirit. As for the sword of Gan and Yue, though cased and treasured, it is never used—this is the height of preciousness. When the spirit flows unimpeded in all four directions, reaching everywhere, above touching Heaven, below coiling upon Earth, transforming and nurturing the myriad things, beyond all image—its name is *Uniting with the Emperor*. The Way of purity and simplicity guards only the spirit. Guarding without loss, it unites with the spirit. The essence of unity penetrates, harmonizing with Heavenly order.\n\nA rustic saying goes: The common man values profit; the incorruptible man values fame; the worthy man esteems will; the Sage treasures essence. Thus, *simplicity* means having nothing mixed with it; *purity* means not harming the spirit. One who embodies purity and simplicity is called a *True Person*.\n\n*Restoring Nature*\nThose who *restore nature* through vulgar learning seek to return to their original state. (Some versions mistakenly add an extra \"vulgar\" due to scribal repetition.) Those who muddle their desires with vulgar thoughts to attain clarity are called the benighted. The ancients who cultivated the Way nurtured knowledge with tranquility. To live without employing knowledge is called nurturing tranquility with knowledge. Knowledge and tranquility nurture each other, and harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature.\n\nVirtue is harmony; the Way is principle. Virtue that embraces all is benevolence; the Way that orders all is righteousness. Righteousness made manifest and things drawn close is loyalty. Centered, pure, and returning to genuine feeling is joy. Trust in conduct, accommodating form, and following pattern is propriety. When propriety and joy spread everywhere, the world falls into chaos. When the upright are obscured and virtue is veiled, virtue does not overreach. Overreaching causes things to lose their nature.\n\nIn ancient times, people dwelt in primordial chaos, attaining tranquility with their age. In that era, yin and yang were harmonious and still, ghosts and spirits did not disturb, the four seasons kept their rhythm, the myriad things were unharmed, and the multitudes did not die young. Though people possessed knowledge, they had no use for it—this was called *Supreme Unity*. In that time, none acted, yet all was constantly spontaneous.\n\nWhen virtue declined, Suiren and Fuxi began to rule the world, and thus compliance was no longer unity. When virtue declined further, Shennong and the Yellow Emperor began to rule the world, and thus peace was no longer compliance. When virtue declined yet further, Yao and Shun began to rule the world, initiating the currents of governance and transformation. Integrity dissolved and simplicity scattered; they departed from the Way to pursue goodness, risked virtue to act. Then they abandoned nature and followed the heart. Heart matched heart in recognition, yet knowledge was insufficient to settle the world. Thus they adorned it with culture and augmented it with erudition.\n\nCulture obliterated substance, erudition drowned the heart—only then did the people first fall into confusion and delusion, unable to return to their nature and feelings and restore their origin.\n\nFrom this we see: the world lost the Way, the Way lost the world—the world and the Way mutually destroyed each other. How could the person of the Way arise in the world? How could the world arise in the Way? If the Way cannot arise in the world, and the world cannot arise in the Way, even if the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, his virtue is concealed. Yet concealment is not self-concealment.\n\nWhat the ancients called \"recluses\" did not crouch in hiding to avoid being seen, did not seal their words to prevent their utterance, did not bury their knowledge to withhold its expression—it was the great error of the times that compelled them. Had their time and destiny aligned with the flourishing of the world, they would have returned to unity without trace. Had their time and destiny been utterly at odds with the world, they would have deeply rooted themselves in tranquility and awaited their end. This is the Way of preserving the self.\n\nThe ancients who preserved themselves did not adorn knowledge with eloquence, did not exhaust the world with knowledge, did not exhaust virtue with knowledge. Serene in their place, they returned to their nature—what more was there to do? The Way is not fulfilled in petty conduct, virtue is not fulfilled in petty understanding. Petty understanding harms virtue, petty conduct harms the Way. Thus it is said: rectify the self and that is all.\n\nTo delight in wholeness is called \"attaining one’s aspiration.\" What the ancients called \"attaining one’s aspiration\" did not refer to carriages and caps of office. It meant nothing could augment their joy. What is now called \"attaining one’s aspiration\" refers to carriages and caps of office. Carriages and caps of office are not one’s nature and destiny—they are transient things that come by chance, a temporary lodging. Lodged in them, their coming cannot be fenced in, their going cannot be halted. Thus one does not indulge the heart for carriages and caps, nor follow the vulgar in poverty and distress. Their joy is the same in both, and so they are without sorrow. Now, if the lodging departs, they are no longer joyful. From this we see: though they may rejoice, they are never without distraction.\n\nThus it is said:\n\nThose who lose themselves in things and forfeit their nature to custom are called \"the people of inverted priorities.\"\n\n*Yielding the Throne*\nYao offered the world to Xu You, but Xu You declined. He then offered it to Zizhou Zhipu, who said: \"That I might be Son of Heaven is acceptable. However, I happen to suffer from a deep-seated melancholy, and am presently treating it. I have no leisure to govern the world.\" The world is of utmost weight, yet he would not let it harm his life—how much less would he do so for other things? Only one who does not take the world as his own concern may be entrusted with the world.\n\nShun offered the world to Zizhou Zhibo, who replied: \"I happen to suffer from a deep-seated melancholy, and am presently treating it. I have no leisure to govern the world.\" Thus the world is a great vessel, yet he would not exchange his life for it. This is how those who embody the Way differ from the vulgar.\n\nShun offered the world to Shan Juan. (Today, on Mount Cang in the south of Changde Prefecture, Wuling County, there stands the Altar of Shan Juan. During the He-Harmonizing reign of the Song, he was posthumously honored as \"Master of Reclusive Loftiness.\" The prefect Li Dao composed an inscription, and near the altar his tomb remains.) Shan Juan said: \"I stand in the midst of the cosmos. In winter I wear furs, in summer I wear coarse or fine hemp. In spring I plow and sow, and my body is sufficient for labor; in autumn I reap and gather, and my person is sufficient for rest and sustenance. I rise with the sun and work, I rest with the sun and sleep, wandering carefree between heaven and earth, my heart and mind content. Why would I take the world for myself? Alas, you do not understand me!\" He refused the offer. Then he departed and entered the deep mountains, and none knew his whereabouts.\n\nShun offered the world to his friend, the farmer of Shihu. The farmer of Shihu said: \"How earnest is the lord’s conduct! A man who conserves his strength!\" He deemed Shun’s virtue not yet perfected. Thereupon, he and his wife shouldered their burdens, led their child, and entered the sea, never to return.\n\nKing Tai of the Zhou dwelled in Bin, and the Di tribes attacked him. He offered them furs and silks, but they refused; he offered them dogs and horses, but they refused; he offered them pearls and jade, but they refused. What the Di sought was land. King Tai said: \"To dwell with a man’s elder brother and kill his younger brother, to dwell with a man’s father and kill his son—I cannot bear it. All of you, do your best to remain here. What difference is there between being my subjects and being subjects of the Di? Moreover, I have heard: one must not harm what is nurtured by what is used for nurturing.\" Thereupon, he took up his staff and departed. The people followed in a continuous stream.\n\nThus he established a state beneath Mount Qi. Indeed, King Tai of Danfu may be said to have known how to honor life. One who honors life, though rich and noble, does not harm the body with what sustains it; though poor and lowly, does not burden the form with profit. Yet men of this age who occupy high office and exalted rank all fear losing them. Seeing gain, they lightly cast away their lives—how can this not be delusion?\n\nThe people of Yue murdered their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, troubled by this, fled into the cinnabar caves, and Yue was left without a king. When they could not find Prince Sou, they pursued him into the cinnabar caves. Prince Sou refused to emerge, so the people of Yue smoked him out with mugwort and bore him forth in the royal carriage. Prince Sou grasped the reins and mounted the chariot, then looked to heaven and cried: \"Rulership! Rulership! Can you truly not spare me?\" Prince Sou did not despise being king—he despised the calamity that comes with kingship. Such a man may be said not to harm his life for the sake of a state. This is why the people of Yue desired him as their ruler.\n\nHan and Wei contended over invaded lands. Master Hua Zi visited Marquis Zhao of Wei, who wore a troubled expression. Master Hua Zi said: \"Suppose now that the world inscribed a pledge before you, its words saying: 'If your left hand seizes it, your right hand will be maimed; if your right hand seizes it, your left hand will be maimed. Yet whoever seizes it shall possess the world.' Would you seize it?\"\n\nMarquis Zhao said: \"I would not seize it.\"\n\nMaster Hua Zi said: \"Excellent. From this we see that both arms are weightier than the world, and the body is weightier than both arms. How much lighter than the world is Han! And how much lighter than Han is what you now contend over! Yet you grieve and harm your life with sorrow for what you cannot obtain.\"\n\nMarquis Zhao said: \"Well said.\"\n\nThe many who have instructed me are legion, yet never have I heard such words before. Master Hua Zi may truly be said to know the weight of things.\n\nWhen the Lord of Lu heard that Yan He was a man who had attained the Way, he dispatched an envoy bearing gifts to precede his visit. Yan He dwelt in a humble lane, clad in coarse cloth, and fed his own oxen. When the envoy of the Lord of Lu arrived, Yan He himself received him.\n\nThe envoy asked: \"Is this the house of Yan Wei?\"\n\nYan He replied: \"This is my house.\"\n\nThe envoy presented the gifts.\n\nYan He responded: \"I fear that if I mishear and accept, I may bring blame upon the envoy. It would be better to verify.\"\n\nThe envoy returned, confirmed the matter, and came again to seek him, but Yan He could not be found. Thus it was with Yan He—he truly despised wealth and honor.\n\nTherefore it is said: The essence of the Way is for the cultivation of the self; its remnants may be used to order the state; its dregs may be applied to govern the world. From this we see that the achievements of emperors and kings are but the leavings of sages, not the means by which one perfects the self and nourishes life. Yet the gentlemen of this vulgar age often endanger their bodies and cast aside their lives in pursuit of things—is this not lamentable?\n\nWhenever the sage acts, he must examine both his purpose and his means. Consider this: if a man were to use the pearl of Marquis Sui to shoot at a sparrow a thousand fathoms high, the world would surely laugh at him. Why? Because what he employs is weighty, while what he seeks is light. How much more so is life itself, which far exceeds the pearl of Marquis Sui in value!\n\nWhen Master Lie Zi was poor, his countenance bore the hue of hunger. A guest mentioned this to Zi Yang of Zheng, saying: \"Lie Yukou is a man of the Way. That he dwells in your state yet suffers poverty—does this not suggest that you, my lord, fail to esteem scholars?\"\n\nZi Yang of Zheng immediately ordered an official to send him grain. When Master Lie Zi saw the envoy, he bowed twice and declined. The envoy departed, and upon entering his home, Master Lie Zi’s wife struck her breast and said: \"I have heard that the wife and children of a man of the Way all enjoy ease and happiness. Yet now you bear the look of hunger, and when the lord sent you food, you refused it. Is this not fate?\"\n\nMaster Lie Zi laughed and said to her: \"The lord does not know me personally; he sent me grain on the word of another. When he seeks to punish me, he will likewise do so on the word of another. This is why I did not accept.\"\n\nIn the end, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Zi Yang.\n\nKing Zhao of Chu lost his kingdom, and Tuyang Shuo fled in the king’s retinue. When King Zhao regained his kingdom and sought to reward those who had followed him, he came to Tuyang Shuo. Tuyang Shuo said: \"When Your Majesty lost the kingdom, I lost my butcher’s stall. Now that Your Majesty has regained the kingdom, I have regained my butcher’s stall. My rank and emolument are already restored—what reward is there to give?\"\n\nThe king said: \"Insist that he accept.\"\n\nTuyang Shuo replied: \"When Your Majesty lost the kingdom, it was not my fault, so I dared not suffer punishment. Now that Your Majesty has regained the kingdom, it is not my merit, so I dare not claim reward.\"\n\nThe king said: \"Let him be received in audience.\"\n\nTuyang Shuo said: \"According to the laws of Chu, only those who have rendered great service and received heavy reward may be granted an audience. My wisdom was not sufficient to preserve the kingdom, nor was my courage sufficient to die in battle against the enemy. When the Wu army entered Ying, I fled from danger and avoided the foe—I did not follow Your Majesty by design. Now if Your Majesty wishes to set aside the law and break the covenant to receive me, this is not what I would have the world hear of me.\"\n\nThe king said to Marshal Zi Qi: \"Tuyang Shuo’s station is lowly, yet his principles are lofty. You shall extend to him the trust of the Three Standards of Honor.\"\n\nTuyang Shuo said: \"The rank of the Three Standards—I know it is nobler than a butcher’s stall. The emolument of ten thousand bushels—I know it is richer than a butcher’s profit. Yet how could I covet rank and emolument and thereby cause my lord to bear the name of reckless bestowal? I dare not accept. I wish only to return to my butcher’s stall.\" And so he would not receive it.\n\nYuan Xian dwelt in Lu. His dwelling was a walled hut thatched with green grass, its gate of woven brambles incomplete, its door pivot made of mulberry wood, its windows of jars. Two rooms were stopped with coarse cloth. The roof leaked, the floor was damp. Yet he sat upright and played the zither.\n\nZi Gong arrived in a grand carriage, clad in an inner robe of dark blue and an outer robe of white, his towering chariot too wide for the lane. He came to see Yuan Xian.\n\nYuan Xian, wearing a hat of rushes and hempen sandals, leaning on a staff of autumn millet, answered the door. Zi Gong said: \"Alas! Master, what ails you?\"\n\nYuan Xian replied: \"I have heard that to lack wealth is called poverty, but to study and be unable to practice is called affliction. Now I am poor, not afflicted.\"\n\nZi Gong stepped back, his face flushed with shame.\n\nYuan Xian laughed and said: \"To act for the sake of worldly approval, to befriend for the sake of cliques, to study for others, to teach for oneself, to cloak oneself in benevolence and righteousness, to adorn oneself with carriages and horses—these are things I cannot bear to do.\"\n\nZengzi dwelt in Wei. His padded robe had no outer garment, his complexion was sallow and emaciated, his hands and feet calloused. For three days he did not kindle a fire, for ten years he did not make new clothes. When he straightened his cap, its strings broke; when he grasped his lapel, his elbows showed; when he put on his shoes, their heels split. Yet he dragged his hempen robe and sang the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filling heaven and earth, as if issuing from metal and stone. The Son of Heaven could not make him a subject, the feudal lords could not make him a friend. Thus, he who cultivates the will forgets the body; he who cultivates the body forgets profit; he who attains the Way forgets the mind.\n\nConfucius said to Yan Hui: \"Hui, come. Your family is poor and your station low—why do you not enter office?\"\n\nYan Hui replied: \"I do not wish to enter office. Outside the outer wall I have fifty *mu* of fields, enough to provide gruel and porridge. Within the outer wall I have ten *mu* of fields, enough to provide silk and hemp. Playing the zither is enough to amuse myself. What I have learned of the Master’s Way is enough to bring me joy.\"\n\nYan Hui did not wish to enter office. Confucius’s countenance changed with solemnity, and he said: \"Excellent, Hui’s resolve! I have heard it said: he who knows contentment does not burden himself with profit; he who examines and attains self-mastery fears not loss; he who cultivates conduct within feels no shame without rank. I have recited these words for a long time, but only now, through Hui, do I truly see them—this is my own gain.\"\n\nPrince Mou of Zhongshan said to Zhanzi: \"Though my body dwells by rivers and lakes, my heart remains beneath the palace gates of Wei—what is to be done?\" Zhanzi replied: \"Value life. When life is valued, profit becomes light.\" Prince Mou of Zhongshan said: \"Though I know this, I cannot overcome myself.\" Zhanzi said: \"If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow your inclinations—what harm is there to the spirit? But if you cannot overcome yourself yet force yourself not to follow, this is called double injury. A doubly injured man belongs not to the long-lived.\"\n\nWei Mou was the son of a lord of ten thousand chariots, yet his retreat to cliffs and caves was harder to achieve than for a commoner. Though he had not yet attained the Way, he could be said to have grasped its intent.\n\nConfucius was beset between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food, subsisting on a thin gruel of wild greens without grain. His complexion was deeply worn, yet he still plucked the zither and sang within his chamber. As Yan Hui picked vegetables, Zilu and Zigong said to one another: \"Our Master was twice driven from Lu, his traces erased in Wei, his tree felled in Song, impoverished in Shang and Zhou, and besieged between Chen and Cai. Those who would kill him bear no guilt; those who would trample him face no prohibition. Yet he still plucks the zither and sings, never ceasing his music—can a gentleman be so shameless?\" Yan Hui had no reply and went in to tell Confucius.\n\nConfucius set aside his zither and sighed deeply: \"You and Ci are petty men. Summon them, and I will speak to them.\" Zilu and Zigong entered.\n\nZilu said: \"In such circumstances, one may truly be called destitute.\"\nConfucius replied: \"What words are these? The gentleman who is at one with the Dao is called 'at one'; he who is cut off from the Dao is called 'destitute.' Now I embrace the Dao of benevolence and righteousness yet encounter the calamities of a disordered age—how can this be called destitution? Thus, when I look within, I am not cut off from the Dao; when I face adversity, I do not lose my virtue. When the cold arrives and frost and snow descend, then I know the flourishing of the pine and cypress. The straits of Chen and Cai—are they not my good fortune?\"\n\nConfucius then calmly returned to his zither and played and sang, while Zilu, grasping his shield, danced vigorously. Zigong said: \"I did not know the height of heaven or the depth of earth. Those of old who attained the Dao found joy in adversity and joy in prosperity—what they rejoiced in was not adversity or prosperity. When the virtue of the Dao is present here, then adversity and prosperity become as the sequence of cold and heat, wind and rain.\"\n\nThus, Xu You took delight by the Ying River, and Gong Bo found contentment on Gong Peak. (Sima Qian notes: Gong Bo’s name was He. He cultivated his conduct and esteemed worthy men. During the troubles of King Li of Zhou, when the Son of Heaven’s line was broken, the feudal lords all requested that he become the new king. He ruled for fourteen years, but a great drought came, and houses burned. Divination was performed at Taiyang. The oracle said: \"King Li is the ancestral culprit; the Duke of Shao then established King Xuan.\" Gong Bo returned to his ancestral line, roaming carefree and content on the heights of Mount Gong. Yet this account may lack foundation. The *Records* state: \"The Duke of Zhou and the Duke of Shao administered the government together, which was called the Gonghe Regency.\")\n\nShun wished to cede the world to his friend Beiren Wuze. Beiren Wuze said: \"How strange is the ruler’s conduct! Dwelling in the furrows of the fields, yet wandering at Yao’s gate. Not content with that, he now seeks to sully me with his disgraceful conduct. I am ashamed to see him.\" Thereupon he cast himself into the Qingling Abyss.\n\nWhen Tang was about to attack Jie, he consulted Bian Sui. Bian Sui said: \"This is not my affair.\" Tang asked: \"Who would be suitable?\" He replied: \"I do not know.\" Tang then consulted Mao Guang. Mao Guang said: \"This is not my affair.\" Tang asked: \"Who would be suitable?\" He replied: \"I do not know.\" Tang said: \"What of Yi Yin?\" Mao Guang said: \"He is strong and enduring, able to bear disgrace—I know nothing beyond that.\" Thereupon Tang consulted with Yi Yin and attacked Jie, defeating him. He then offered the throne to Bian Sui. Bian Sui declined, saying: \"When the ruler consulted me about attacking Jie, he must have regarded me as a villain. Now that he has defeated Jie and offers me the throne, he must regard me as greedy. I was born in a disordered age, and a man without the Dao has twice sought to sully me with his disgraceful conduct—I cannot bear to hear of it again.\" He then cast himself into the Zhou River and died.\n\nTang next offered the throne to Mao Guang, saying: \"The wise plan, the martial execute, the benevolent reside—this is the Way of antiquity. Why do you not take the throne?\" Mao Guang declined, saying: \"To depose a ruler is not righteous; to kill the people is not benevolent; to let others face danger while I enjoy the benefits is not upright. I have heard it said: 'One does not accept emoluments that are not righteous; in an age without the Dao, one does not tread its soil—how much less accept its honors?' I cannot bear to see this any longer.\" He then carried a stone and drowned himself in the Lu River.\n\nIn the rise of the Zhou, there were two knights dwelling in Guzhu, named Boyi and Shuqi. The two said to one another: \"We have heard there is a man in the west who seems to possess the Dao. Let us go and observe.\" When they reached Qiyang, King Wu heard of them and sent Shu Dan to meet them.\n\nThey swore an oath, saying: \"We shall grant you two ranks of wealth and appoint you to one rank of office.\" They slaughtered an animal and buried it as a sacrificial pledge. The two looked at each other and laughed, saying: \"Ah, how strange! This is not what we call the Dao.\n\nIn the days when Shennong ruled all under Heaven, sacrifices were performed with utmost reverence, yet no blessings were sought. In his dealings with others, loyalty and sincerity governed all, yet nothing was demanded in return. Joy in governance was governance itself; joy in order was order itself. He did not build himself up by others’ ruin, nor exalt himself by others’ lowliness, nor profit from the times he encountered.\n\nNow the Zhou, seeing the disorder of Yin, has hastily seized power. They scheme above and traffic in bribes below; they rely on military force to maintain their might, slaughter animals to swear oaths as pledges of trust, parade their conduct to please the masses, and resort to killing and warfare to seize advantage. This is but replacing one form of violence with another.\n\nWe have heard that the knights of old, when encountering an age of order, did not shirk their duty; when facing an age of chaos, they did not cling to mere survival. Now all under Heaven is benighted, and the virtue of Zhou has declined. To align ourselves with Zhou would only sully our persons—better to avoid it and preserve the purity of our conduct.\"\n\nThe two then traveled north to Mount Shouyang, where they starved to death.\n\nAs for Boyi and Shuqi, when it came to wealth and honor, if it could be avoided, they would never rely on lofty integrity or perverse conduct to indulge their own wills while refusing to serve the world. Such was the steadfastness of these two knights.\n\n*The Twenty-Eighth Scroll of the Nan Hua Zhen Jing, Following the Original Text, Concludes*\n\n**The Twenty-Ninth Scroll of the Nan Hua Zhen Jing, Following the Original Text**\n\n*Collated by Peng Xiang, Disciple of Lu Ling Zhu Feng Luo Mian Dao*\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: Robber Zhi**\n\nThe following account resembles those found in the *Strategies of Lu* and the *Records of the Grand Historian*, likely composed by Chu Shaosun.\n\nConfucius was a friend of Liuxia Ji. Liuxia Ji’s younger brother was named Robber Zhi.\n\nRobber Zhi commanded nine thousand followers, rampaging across the world and terrorizing the feudal lords. He broke into homes, drove off people’s cattle and horses, seized their wives and daughters, coveted gain while forgetting kinship, showing no regard for parents or brothers, nor offering sacrifices to his ancestors. Wherever he passed, great states fortified their cities, small states took refuge in their strongholds, and the common people suffered greatly.\n\nConfucius said to Liuxia Ji: \"As a father, one must instruct his son; as an elder brother, one must teach his younger brother. If a father cannot instruct his son, or an elder brother cannot teach his younger brother, then the bond of father and son, elder and younger brother, is worthless. Now, sir, you are a man of talent in this age, yet your brother is Robber Zhi, a scourge upon the world, and you cannot teach him. I am secretly ashamed for you. Allow me to go and reason with him.\"\n\nLiuxia Ji replied: \"You say that a father must instruct his son, and an elder brother must teach his younger brother. But if a son does not heed his father’s instruction, or a younger brother does not accept his elder brother’s teaching, what can even your eloquence accomplish? Moreover, Zhi’s nature is such that his mind surges like a spring, his will gusts like the wind. He is strong enough to resist enemies, eloquent enough to gloss over wrongs. He delights when his heart is obeyed, rages when it is opposed, and is easily provoked by words. You must not go!\"\n\nConfucius did not listen. Yan Hui drove the carriage, and Zigong stood to the right as they went to see Robber Zhi.\n\nRobber Zhi was then resting his troops on the southern slope of Mount Tai, devouring the liver of a man. Confucius descended from the carriage and approached, addressing the herald: \"I, Kong Qiu of Lu, have heard of the general’s lofty virtue and humbly bow twice to the herald.\"\n\nThe herald went in to announce him. Robber Zhi, upon hearing this, flew into a rage. His eyes blazed like stars, his hair bristled to his cap, and he said: \"Is this not that crafty, deceitful man Kong Qiu of Lu? Tell him this: You fabricate words and invent phrases, falsely invoking Wen and Wu. You wear a cap of dead branches and gird yourself with the ribs of a dead ox. You spout endless, twisted arguments, eating without plowing, clothing yourself without weaving. You flap your lips and wag your tongue, stirring up right and wrong to delude the rulers of the world. You lead the scholars of the world astray, making them abandon their roots to falsely practice filial piety and brotherly love, all in hopes of seizing fiefs and riches. Your crimes are grave and heavy indeed! Flee at once! Or I shall add your liver to my midday meal.\"\n\nConfucius sent word again: \"I am fortunate to be acquainted with Ji and wish to gaze upon the hem of your robe.\"\n\nThe herald relayed this. Robber Zhi said: \"Let him come forward.\"\n\nConfucius hurried forward, stepped back from his mat, and bowed twice to Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi was enraged. He stretched out his legs, gripped his sword, glared fiercely, and roared like a nursing tiger: \"Come forward, Qiu! If your words please me, you shall live; if they oppose me, you shall die.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"I have heard that there are three virtues under Heaven: To be born and grow tall, surpassingly handsome, so that young and old, noble and base, all delight in seeing you—this is the highest virtue. To comprehend the workings of Heaven and Earth and distinguish all things—this is the middle virtue. To be brave, fierce, and resolute, gathering troops and leading armies—this is the lowest virtue. Whoever possesses even one of these virtues is fit to face south and declare himself sovereign. Now, general, you possess all three: your body stands eight feet and two inches tall, your face and eyes radiant, your lips like gleaming cinnabar, your teeth like aligned shells, your voice attuned to the Yellow Bell. Yet you are called Robber Zhi—I am secretly ashamed for you that you do not claim what is rightfully yours. If you are willing to heed me, I shall go south to Wu and Yue, north to Qi and Lu, east to Song and Wei, west to Jin and Chu, and have a great city of several hundred *li* built for you, establishing a domain of hundreds of thousands of households. I shall exalt you as a feudal lord, renewing the world with you, disbanding your troops, gathering and nurturing your brothers, and together offering sacrifices to your ancestors. This is the conduct of a sage and a man of talent, the wish of all under Heaven.\"\n\nRobber Zhi flew into a rage and said: \"Come forward, Qiu! Those who can be swayed by profit or admonished by words are but the foolish and vulgar masses. Now, to be tall and handsome, so that all who see you are pleased—this is the legacy of my parents. Even if you do not praise me, do I not know this myself? Moreover, I have heard that those who flatter others to their faces also slander them behind their backs. Now you speak to me of great cities and multitudes of people—you seek to lure me with profit and treat me like a tame beast. How can this last? The greatest of cities is still smaller than the world. Yao and Shun ruled all under Heaven, yet their descendants had not even a place to drive a nail. Tang and Wu became Sons of Heaven, yet their lines were later extinguished. Was this not because their gains were too great?\n\nFurthermore, I have heard that in ancient times, beasts were many and people few, so the people dwelled in nests to avoid them. By day they gathered acorns and chestnuts, by night they roosted in trees—thus they were called the people of the Nest Builder. In ancient times, people did not know clothing. In summer they piled up firewood, in winter they warmed themselves by it—thus they were called the people who knew how to live. In the age of Shennong, they lay at ease and rose carefree. People knew their mothers but not their fathers, living among the deer, plowing to eat, weaving to clothe themselves, with no thought of harming one another.\"\n\nThis was the height of utmost virtue. Yet even the Yellow Emperor could not fully realize virtue, battling Chiyou on the fields of Zhuolu, where blood flowed for a hundred li. Yao and Shun arose and established their ministers. Tang exiled his lord, and King Wu killed Zhou. From then on, the strong oppressed the weak, and the many tyrannized the few. Since the time of Tang and Wu, all have been followers of disorder.\n\nNow you, sir, cultivate the Way of Wen and Wu, grasp the world’s debates, and teach later generations. Wearing fine robes and sashes, you speak with artful words and feign virtuous conduct to delude the lords of the world, all to seek wealth and honor. No thief is greater than you—why does the world not call you *Thief Qiu* instead of calling me *Robber Zhi*?\n\nYou used honeyed words to persuade Zilu to follow you. You made Zilu remove his warrior’s cap, lay aside his long sword, and receive your teachings. The world all says: *Confucius can halt violence and forbid wrongdoing.* Yet in the end, Zilu sought to kill the lord of Wei but failed, and his body was minced upon the eastern gate of Wei. This was because your teaching was insufficient.\n\nDo you still claim to be a man of talent and a sage? You were twice driven from Lu, your traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Qi, besieged in Chen and Cai, and found no refuge under heaven. You taught Zilu to meet such a fate—unable to secure his own safety above or benefit others below—how can your Way be worthy of esteem?\n\nOf those the world exalts, none surpasses the Yellow Emperor. Yet even he could not preserve perfect virtue, fighting on the fields of Zhuolu where blood flowed for a hundred li. Yao was not kind, Shun was not filial, Yu was crippled, Tang exiled his lord, King Wu attacked Zhou, and King Wen was imprisoned at Youli. These six men are those the world reveres. Yet if we examine them closely, all were deluded by profit, forcing themselves against their true nature. Their conduct is truly shameful.\n\nThe world calls worthy men like Boyi and Shuqi. Boyi and Shuqi renounced the rulership of Gubuzhu, starved to death on Mount Shouyang, and their flesh went unburied. Bao Jiao adorned his conduct to condemn the age and died embracing a tree. Shentu Di remonstrated but was not heeded, so he carried a stone and drowned himself in the river, becoming food for fish and turtles. Jie Zitui was utterly loyal, cutting flesh from his thigh to feed Duke Wen. Later, the duke betrayed him, so Zitui left in anger and burned to death holding a tree. Weisheng arranged to meet a woman beneath a bridge; when she did not come and the waters rose, he refused to leave and drowned holding the bridge pillar. These six men differ not from dismembered dogs, drowned pigs, or beggars clutching gourds—all abandoned their names, scorned death, and failed to cherish their fundamental nature or nurture their lives.\n\nThe world calls loyal ministers like Prince Bigan and Wu Zixu. Zixu was sunk in the river, and Bigan had his heart cut out. These two are called loyal ministers, yet in the end, the world laughs at them. From a higher perspective, even Zixu and Bigan are not worthy of esteem.\n\nAs for what you, Qiu, tell me: if you speak of ghostly matters, I cannot know them. But if you speak of human affairs, it is no more than this—all things I have already heard and understood.\n\nNow I tell you of human nature: the eye desires to see beauty, the ear desires to hear sound, the mouth desires to savor flavor, and the will and qi desire fulfillment. Of men, the longest-lived reach a hundred years, the average eighty, the shortest sixty—yet when we subtract days lost to illness, frailty, mourning, death, and sorrow, the moments when one opens one’s mouth to laugh amount to no more than four or five days in a month.\n\nHeaven and earth are without end, but man’s death comes at its appointed time. Clutching the instrument of this appointed time, one entrusts oneself to the boundless expanse—suddenly, it is no different from a fine steed galloping past a crack in the wall. Those who cannot delight their will and nurture their lives are all men who have not mastered the Way.\n\nAll that you, Qiu, have said is what I reject. Go quickly, return home, and speak no more of it. Your Way is but a frenzied, babbling, deceitful, and hollow sham—it cannot preserve the true. What is there to discuss?\n\nConfucius bowed twice, hurried out, mounted his carriage, and grasped the reins—three times they slipped from his hands. His eyes were dazed and sightless, his complexion ashen like the dead. He leaned against the crossbar, head bowed, unable to catch his breath. Returning to the eastern gate of Lu, he chanced upon Liuxia Ji.\n\nLiuxia Ji said, “You have been absent these past days, and your carriage bears the marks of travel. Might you have gone to see Zhi?”\n\nConfucius looked up to the heavens and sighed, “Yes.”\n\nLiuxia Ji asked, “Did Zhi perhaps offend you as I warned?”\n\nConfucius replied, “Yes. I am one who, having no illness, yet cauterizes himself. I rushed to stroke the tiger’s head and braid its whiskers—nearly did I not escape the tiger’s jaws!”\n\nZizhang asked Mang Goude, “Why not act with virtue? Without virtuous action, one is not trusted; without trust, one is not employed; without employment, one gains no benefit. Thus, when one considers reputation and calculates profit, righteousness and truth are what matter. If one abandons reputation and profit and turns inward to the heart, then can a scholar go even a single day without virtuous action?”\n\nMang Goude replied, “The shameless grow rich, and the deceitful rise to prominence. The greatest of reputation and profit lie in shamelessness and deceit. Thus, when one considers reputation and calculates profit, trust and truth are what matter. If one abandons reputation and profit and turns inward to the heart, then does not the scholar’s action embrace the Heavenly?”\n\nZizhang said, “In ancient times, Jie and Zhou were honored as Sons of Heaven and possessed all under heaven. Yet if one were to tell Zang Ju, ‘Your conduct is like Jie and Zhou,’ his face would flush with shame, and he would bristle with resentment—such is the low regard of petty men. Confucius and Mo Di lived in poverty as commoners. Yet if one were to tell a prime minister, ‘Your conduct is like Confucius and Mo Di,’ his expression would change, and he would claim insufficiency—such is the true esteem of the scholar. Thus, to be a Son of Heaven does not necessarily confer honor, nor does poverty as a commoner necessarily confer disgrace. The distinction between honor and disgrace lies in the beauty or baseness of one’s conduct.”\n\nMang Goude said, “Petty thieves are imprisoned, but great thieves become lords. At the gates of lords, righteous scholars abide. In former times, Duke Huan of Qi killed his elder brother and took his sister-in-law, yet Guan Zhong served as his minister. Tian Chengzi murdered his lord and usurped the state, yet Confucius accepted his gifts.”\n\nThe judgment deems them base, the conduct degrades them—thus the true nature of word and deed wars within the breast. Is this not perverse?\n\nThus the *Book* says: “Who is vile? Who is noble? The accomplished stand at the head, the unaccomplished at the tail.”\n\nZizhang said: “If you do not act, kinship and estrangement will lack order, noble and base will lack righteousness, elder and younger will lack sequence. How then shall the Five Norms and Six Positions be distinguished?”\n\nMang Goude said: “Yao executed his eldest son, Shun exiled his younger brother—where is the order in kinship? Tang banished Jie, King Wu slew Zhou—where is the righteousness in noble and base? King Ji was the rightful heir, yet the Duke of Zhou killed his elder brother—where is the sequence in elder and younger? The Confucians preach hypocritical words, the Mohists advocate universal love—how then shall the Five Norms and Six Positions be distinguished?\n\nMoreover, you rectify for the sake of fame, I rectify for the sake of profit. In truth, fame and profit neither accord with principle nor reflect the Dao. Daily I dispute with you before Wu Yue, saying: ‘The petty man dies for wealth, the noble man dies for fame—their motives for altering their nature differ, yet in abandoning what they do to pursue what they do not, they are one and the same.’\n\nThus it is said: Do not be a petty man, lest you die in rebellion against Heaven. Do not be a noble man, but follow Heaven’s principle. Whether crooked or straight, align with the celestial pole. Observe the four directions, ebb and flow with the times. Whether right or wrong, grasp the revolving mechanism. Stand alone in intent, wander with the Dao. Act without contrivance, establish no fixed righteousness, lest you lose what you seek. Pursue no wealth, achieve no fame, lest you abandon Heaven.\n\nBigan was disemboweled, Zixu had his eyes gouged out—such are the calamities of loyalty. Zhigong testified against his father, Weisheng drowned holding to his word—such are the perils of trust. Baozi stood until he withered, Shenzi refused to defend himself—such are the harms of integrity. Confucius did not see his mother, Kuangzi did not see his father—such are the failures of righteousness.\n\nFrom the traditions of antiquity to the discourses of later ages, those esteemed as scholars rectify their words and align their deeds, yet still suffer misfortune and encounter disaster.”\n\nWu Zu asked Zhi He: “No man in the end fails to pursue fame and seek profit. The wealthy draw men to them; those drawn defer to them; those who defer honor them. To be honored and deferred is the Way to long life, bodily ease, and joy of heart. Yet you alone show no such intent—is your wisdom insufficient? Or do you know but lack the strength to act? Or do you deliberately reject the true path?”\n\nZhi He said: “These men, born in the same age and dwelling in the same village, regard those who transcend custom and surpass the world as lacking any guiding principle. Thus they survey the ages, discerning right and wrong. They conform to the俗 and transform with the世, abandoning what is most weighty, discarding what is most honorable, all for the sake of their pursuits. How can their discourse on the Way to long life, bodily ease, and joy of heart not be far from the mark?\n\nThe agony of sorrow, the peace of contentment—these are not reflected in the body. The terror of alarm, the joy of delight—these are not mirrored in the heart. They know what they do but not why they do it. Thus, though they be honored as Son of Heaven and possess all under Heaven, they cannot escape misfortune.”\n\nWu Zu said: “Wealth, to man, is without disadvantage. It exhausts beauty and exhausts power, reaching what the perfected cannot attain, what the worthy cannot equal. It wields the courage and strength of the heroic as its might, commands the wisdom and schemes of others as its insight, and appropriates the virtue of others as its own excellence. Though not enthroned, it is revered as a lord and father.\n\nMoreover, the allure of sound and color, flavor and power—these delight the heart without need of learning, comfort the body without need of imitation. Desires and aversions, approach and avoidance—these require no teacher, for they are man’s nature. Though all under Heaven condemn me, who can renounce them?”\n\nZhi He said: “The actions of the wise move in accord with the people, not transgressing their measure. Thus, content, they do not contend; lacking nothing, they do not seek. Those who lack seek, contending in all directions yet not deeming themselves greedy. Those who have surplus yield, relinquishing all under Heaven yet not deeming themselves incorrupt. The truth of incorruptibility and greed lies not in external compulsion but in reflecting on one’s own measure.\n\nThough enthroned as Son of Heaven, they do not use their nobility to domineer. Though possessing all under Heaven, they do not use their wealth to toy with others. Calculating the harm, considering the consequences, they deem it injurious to their nature, and thus decline and do not accept—not to seek fame and reputation.\n\nYao and Shun ruled as emperors and were revered, not to benevolently govern all under Heaven, but to avoid harming life with beauty. Shanjuan and Xu You declined the throne, not out of empty humility, but to avoid harming themselves with affairs. All sought what benefited them and declined what harmed them. Though all under Heaven calls them worthy, they did not act to cultivate fame and reputation.”\n\nWu Zu said: “If one must cling to fame, endure bodily hardship, forgo sweetness, and restrain nourishment to preserve life, one is no better than a chronic invalid, long afflicted yet not dead.”\n\nZhi He said: “Equilibrium is fortune, excess is harm—of all things, none is not so, and wealth is the most extreme. Now, the rich man’s ears are filled with the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes; his mouth savors the taste of fine meats and rich wines, stirring his mind and causing him to neglect his affairs—can this be called disorder? Engulfed in arrogance, he labors like one bearing a heavy burden uphill—can this be called suffering? Coveting wealth, he seeks consolation; craving power, he exhausts himself. At rest, he is drowned in indolence; in comfort, he is swollen with pride—can this be called sickness? Driven by the desire for wealth and the pursuit of profit, he is deafened as though his ears were walled up, yet does not avoid it; he is haughty yet does not desist—can this be called disgrace? Wealth accumulates yet goes unused; he clings to it without release, his heart filled with sorrow and bitterness, ever seeking more without cease—can this be called sorrow?”\n\nWithin, he fears the threats of extortion and demands; without, he dreads the harm of bandits and thieves. His inner chambers are fortified with towers and bars, and he dares not walk alone outside—can this be called fear? These six afflictions are the greatest harms under heaven, yet all are overlooked and left unexamined. When disaster strikes, he exhausts his nature and depletes his wealth in vain, unable even to restore a single day of peace. Thus, when viewed by name, they are unseen; when sought for profit, they are unattainable. Yet men strain their minds and break their bodies in contention for these—is this not delusion?\n\n*The Southern Florescence True Classic, Following the Root, Scroll Twenty-Nine Concludes*\n*The Southern Florescence True Classic, Following the Root, Scroll Thirty*\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: Discourse on Swords**\n\nLong ago, King Wen of Zhao delighted in swords. Over three thousand swordsmen thronged his gates as guests, clashing before him day and night. Each year, more than a hundred perished or were wounded, yet his passion knew no end. After three years of this, the state declined, and the feudal lords plotted against him.\n\nThe crown prince, Kui, grew anxious and offered a reward to his attendants: “Whoever can persuade the king to abandon his fondness for swordsmen shall receive a thousand gold pieces.” His attendants replied, “Zhuangzi is the one for this.”\n\nThe prince sent envoys bearing a thousand gold pieces to present to Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi declined the gift and accompanied the messengers to see the prince. “What instruction does the prince have for me,” he asked, “that he offers me a thousand gold pieces?” The prince replied, “I have heard that you are enlightened and sagely. I humbly present this gold to honor your attendants. If you refuse it, how dare I speak further?”\n\nZhuangzi said, “I have heard that the prince wishes to employ me to end the king’s obsession. If I persuade the king but displease him, or fail to satisfy the prince, I shall be executed—what use would gold be to me then? But if I please the king and satisfy the prince, what in Zhao could I not obtain?”\n\nThe prince said, “Indeed. My father sees only swordsmen.”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “Very well. I am skilled in the sword.”\n\nThe prince said, “But the swordsmen my father favors all have unkempt hair, bristling sideburns, drooping caps, tassels of coarse silk, short jackets, glaring eyes, and speak with difficulty. The king delights in them. If you appear before him in scholar’s robes, the outcome will be most unfavorable.”\n\nZhuangzi said, “Allow me to prepare a swordsman’s attire.” After three days, he had his sword attire ready and was presented to the prince, who then accompanied him to see the king.\n\nThe king drew his naked blade and waited. Zhuangzi entered the palace hall without haste, and when he saw the king, he did not bow. The king asked, “What instruction do you bring, that the prince has gone before me?”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “I have heard that Your Majesty delights in swords, so I have come to present myself with my sword.”\n\nThe king asked, “What can your sword do to restrain others?”\n\nZhuangzi answered, “My sword cuts down one man every ten paces, and its course is unobstructed for a thousand *li*.”\n\nThe king was greatly pleased and said, “You would be invincible under heaven!”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “The way of the sword is to present emptiness, offer advantage, strike after the opponent moves, and arrive first. I would like to demonstrate.”\n\nThe king said, “Rest now, return to your lodging, and await my command. I shall arrange a contest and summon you.”\n\nThe king then tested his swordsmen for seven days, during which over sixty were killed or wounded. He selected five or six and had them stand with their swords in the palace courtyard before summoning Zhuangzi.\n\nThe king said, “Today, let us see you contend with these men.”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “I have long awaited this.”\n\nThe king asked, “What length of sword do you wield?”\n\nZhuangzi said, “Any length will do, but I possess three swords, and I shall use whichever Your Majesty prefers. Allow me to describe them first, then demonstrate.”\n\nThe king said, “I wish to hear of the three swords.”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “There is the sword of the Son of Heaven, the sword of the feudal lords, and the sword of the commoner.”\n\nThe king asked, “What is the sword of the Son of Heaven like?”\n\nZhuangzi said, “The sword of the Son of Heaven has its edge in Yanxi and Shicheng, its guard in Mount Tai of Qi, its spine in Jin and Wei, its hilt in Zhou and Song, and its sides in Han and Wei. It is wrapped in the four barbarian tribes, bound by the four seasons, encircled by the Bohai Sea, and girded by Mount Heng. It is governed by the five phases, judged by punishment and virtue, opened by yin and yang, sustained by spring and summer, and wielded in autumn and winter. When this sword is thrust forward, nothing precedes it; when raised, nothing is above it; when pressed down, nothing is beneath it; when swung, nothing stands beside it. Above, it severs floating clouds; below, it cuts through the earth’s foundations. When this sword is employed, the feudal lords are brought to order, and all under heaven submit. This is the sword of the Son of Heaven.”\n\nKing Wen, bewildered and lost in thought, asked, “What is the sword of the feudal lords like?”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “The sword of the feudal lords has its edge in the wisdom and courage of knights, its guard in the purity and integrity of scholars, its spine in the worthiness and goodness of gentlemen, its hilt in the loyalty and sagacity of sages, and its sides in the boldness and heroism of warriors. When this sword is thrust forward, nothing precedes it; when raised, nothing is above it; when pressed down, nothing is beneath it; when swung, nothing stands beside it. Above, it follows the roundness of heaven, aligning with the three luminaries; below, it follows the squareness of earth, aligning with the four seasons.”\n\nThe sword of the feudal lords harmonizes the people’s will and pacifies the four quarters. When this sword is wielded, it strikes like thunder, and within the four borders, none fail to submit and heed the ruler’s command. Such is the sword of the feudal lords.\n\nThe king asked, “What is the sword of the common people like?”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “The sword of the common people: unkempt hair, bristling sideburns, a drooping cap, a frayed tassel, a short-backed robe, glaring eyes, and quarrelsome speech. They clash before one another, severing heads and necks above, piercing livers and lungs below. This sword of the common people differs not from cockfighting—once their lives are spent, they serve no purpose in the affairs of state. Now, though Your Majesty holds the position of the Son of Heaven, you favor the sword of the common people. Your servant humbly deems this unworthy of you.”\n\nThe king then led Zhuangzi to ascend the hall. The royal chef presented the meal, and the king circled the table thrice.\n\nZhuangzi said, “May Your Majesty sit composed and settle your qi. The matter of the sword has now been concluded.”\n\nThereafter, King Wen did not leave his palace for three months, and the swordsmen all perished where they stood.\n\n---\n\nConfucius wandered in the forest of black curtains and rested upon the Apricot Terrace.\n\nThe disciples read their books while Confucius strummed the zither and sang. Halfway through the melody, an old fisherman disembarked and approached. His beard and brows were snowy white, his hair unbound, his sleeves swaying as he walked up from the marshland. He halted at the edge of the shore, his left hand resting on his knee, his right hand supporting his chin, listening intently. When the song ended, he beckoned to Zilu and Zigong, who both came forward.\n\nThe stranger pointed at Confucius and asked, “What is that man doing?”\n\nZilu replied, “He is a gentleman of Lu.”\n\nThe stranger asked about his lineage.\n\nZilu answered, “His family name is Kong.”\n\nThe stranger asked, “And what does this Kong family practice?”\n\nZilu did not respond, but Zigong answered, “The Master Kong cultivates loyalty and trustworthiness in his nature, embodies benevolence and righteousness in his conduct, refines ritual and music, and discerns human relationships. Above, he is devoted to the rulers of the age; below, he transforms the common people, all for the benefit of the world. This is what the Kong family practices.”\n\nThe stranger asked further, “Is he a lord with lands?”\n\nZigong said, “No.”\n\n“Is he an advisor to kings and princes?”\n\nZigong said, “No.”\n\nThe stranger laughed and turned to leave, saying, “Benevolent, to be sure—but I fear he will not escape harm to himself. He wearies his mind and wears out his body, endangering his true nature. Alas!”\n\nFar indeed has he strayed from the Dao.\n\nZigong returned and reported to Confucius. Confucius pushed aside his zither and rose, saying, “He must be a sage!” Then he descended to seek him out. By the marsh’s edge, the stranger was just then staff in hand, drawing his boat toward shore. Glancing back, he saw Confucius, turned around, and stood facing him. Confucius retreated, bowed twice, and advanced.\n\nThe stranger asked, “What do you seek?”\n\nConfucius replied, “A short while ago, sir left with words unfinished. I, unworthy as I am, did not grasp their meaning. I have waited humbly in your wake, hoping to hear even the sound of your cough or spittle, that I might complete my understanding.”\n\nThe stranger exclaimed, “Ah! How earnest is your love of learning!”\n\nConfucius bowed twice and rose, saying, “From my youth I have cultivated learning, and now at sixty-nine, I have yet to hear the highest teaching. How dare I not remain open in heart?”\n\nThe stranger said, “Like attracts like, and like sounds resonate—this is the principle of Heaven. Let me set forth what I possess and expound upon what you pursue. What you pursue pertains to human affairs. When the Son of Heaven, the feudal lords, the great officers, and the common people—these four—each rectifies himself, governance is at its finest. When these four abandon their proper stations, no disorder could be greater. When officials attend to their duties and each person concerns himself with his own affairs, none oversteps his bounds. Thus, fields lie fallow and homes stand exposed, clothing and food are insufficient, taxes and levies go uncollected, wives and concubines are at odds, and elders and juniors lack proper order—these are the worries of the common people. Inability to fulfill one’s role, official duties left undone, conduct that is not pure and clear, subordinates who are negligent and idle, achievements unrecognized, ranks and emoluments unsecured—these are the worries of the great officers. The court lacks loyal ministers, the state is benighted and disordered, artisans lack skill, tribute is unworthy, seasonal offerings lag behind others, and one does not follow the Son of Heaven—these are the worries of the feudal lords. Yin and yang are out of harmony, cold and heat arrive untimely, harming the myriad things; feudal lords act with violence and disorder, seizing and attacking one another, ravaging the people; ritual and music lack moderation, resources are exhausted, human relationships are unadorned, and the hundred clans are licentious and chaotic—these are the worries of the Son of Heaven’s ministers.\n\nNow, you possess neither the authority of the Son of Heaven, the feudal lords, or their ministers above, nor the office of a great officer with its duties below, yet you presume to refine ritual and music, select human relationships, and transform the common people. Is this not overreaching in affairs?\n\nMoreover, people have eight flaws, and affairs have four perils—these cannot be left unexamined. To engage in affairs not one’s own is called *meddling*; to advance where none pays heed is called *flattery*; to speak in accord with another’s wishes is called *sycophancy*; to speak without discerning right or wrong is called *obsequiousness*; to delight in speaking of others’ faults is called *slander*; to sever friendships and estrange kin is called *treachery*; to praise falsely and deceive in order to ruin others is called *depravity*; to fail to distinguish good from bad, to accommodate both sides, and to stealthily seize what one desires is called *perfidy*. These eight flaws bring chaos to others externally and harm to oneself internally. The noble person does not befriend such, nor does the enlightened ruler employ them.\n\nAs for the four perils: to delight in managing great affairs, altering and changing constants in pursuit of merit and fame is called *presumptuousness*; to monopolize knowledge, arrogate affairs, encroach upon others, and act on one’s own is called *greed*; to see one’s faults yet not change, and to hear admonition yet grow worse is called *obduracy*; to approve only what accords with oneself and disapprove even what is good if it differs from oneself is called *arrogance*. These are the four perils. Only when one has cast off the eight flaws and refrains from the four perils can one be taught.\n\nConfucius sighed deeply, bowed twice, and rose, saying, “I was twice driven from Lu, had my traces erased in Wei, was made to fell a tree in Song, and was besieged between Chen and Cai. I do not know what errors I committed to incur these four slanders—why is this?”\n\nThe stranger’s expression turned somber as he said, “How difficult it is for you to awaken! There was a man who feared his shadow and loathed his footprints, and so ran to escape them. The more he lifted his feet, the more footprints he made; the faster he ran, the more his shadow clung to him. Believing he was still too slow, he ran without cease until he collapsed and died. He did not know that by standing in the shade he could rest his shadow, and by remaining still he could still his footprints—how foolish he was!\n\nYou scrutinize the space between benevolence and righteousness, examine the boundaries of sameness and difference, observe the changes of activity and stillness, adjust the measure of giving and receiving, order the passions of like and dislike, and harmonize the moderation of joy and anger—yet you nearly fail to escape harm. If you carefully cultivate your own person, guard your true nature, and return things to others, you will have no encumbrances. Now, instead of cultivating your own person, you seek from others—is this not misplaced?”\n\nConfucius sighed deeply and asked, “May I ask what is meant by *true*?”\n\nThe stranger said, “*True* is the utmost of essence and sincerity. Without essence and sincerity, one cannot move others. Thus, one who forces tears may seem sorrowful but is not mournful; one who forces anger may seem stern but is not awe-inspiring; one who forces affection may smile but is not harmonious. True sorrow is silent yet mournful; true anger is unexpressed yet awe-inspiring; true affection is unsmiling yet harmonious. When truth resides within, the spirit moves without. This is why truth is prized.\n\nApplied to human principles: in serving parents, it is filial piety; in serving rulers, it is loyalty; in drinking wine, it is joy; in mourning, it is sorrow. In all things, integrity must be primary: in achievement, merit is primary; in drinking wine, joy is primary; in mourning, sorrow is primary; in serving parents, suitability is primary. When merit is achieved, no trace of it remains; in serving parents with suitability, no account of the means is kept; in drinking wine with joy, no selection of vessels is made; in mourning with sorrow, no inquiry into ritual is had.\n\nRitual is what the common customs devise; truth is what one receives from Heaven, naturally and unalterably. Thus, the sage models himself on Heaven and values truth, not being bound by custom. The foolish do the opposite: they cannot model themselves on Heaven and are anxious about others; they do not know the value of truth and, in their mediocrity, are swayed by custom. Thus, they are never sufficient. How lamentable! You were early immersed in human artifice and only now hear of the great Dao.”\n\nConfucius bowed twice and rose, saying: “Today, I, Qiu, have had the good fortune of an encounter—truly as if favored by Heaven. You, Master, have not disdained to treat me as a servant and instruct me in person. Dare I ask where you dwell? I would follow and receive your teaching, that I might complete my study of the great Dao.”\n\nThe stranger replied: “I have heard this: those who can be led may be guided to the subtle Dao; those who cannot be led do not comprehend the Way. Take care not to guide them, lest you bring harm upon yourself. Strive on, for I leave you now.” With that, he poled his boat away, gliding along the reeds.\n\nYan Yuan turned the carriage, and Zilu handed the reins, but Confucius did not look back. Only when the water’s ripples stilled and the sound of the oar vanished did he dare to board. Zilu stepped beside the carriage and asked: “I, You, have long served you, yet never have I seen you meet another with such reverence. Kings of ten thousand chariots, lords of a thousand, when they meet you, do not fail to observe proper courtesy, yet you still bear a bearing of dignified reserve. Now this old fisherman, leaning on his staff and standing defiantly, and you bowed deeply, bending like a chime stone, responding with words and bows—was this not excessive? The disciples all find it strange. What has this fisherman done to deserve such treatment?”\n\nConfucius leaned on the crossbar and sighed, saying: “Truly, You, you are difficult to transform. Though you have been steeped in ritual and righteousness for some time, your coarse and rustic heart remains unchanged to this day. Come closer, and I will tell you: to meet an elder without reverence is to lack ritual; to meet a worthy without respect is to lack benevolence. If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself before others. If one does not humble oneself with utmost sincerity, one cannot attain the truth, and thus one’s person suffers lasting harm. Alas! There is no greater misfortune for a person than the lack of benevolence—and you alone cling to it!\n\nMoreover, the Dao is that by which all things proceed. All beings that lose it die; those that attain it live. In affairs, to go against it is to fail; to follow it is to succeed. Thus, wherever the Dao resides, the sage honors it. Now this old fisherman possesses the Dao—how could I dare not revere him?”\n\n*The Southern Florescence Scripture, following the original text, concludes its thirtieth scroll.*",

      "translated_text": "*The Southern Florescence True Classic: A Return to the Root*\n\n**Text Title:** *The Southern Florescence True Classic: A Return to the Root*\nAuthor: Luo Miandao of the Ming dynasty\nThirty fascicles\nSource edition: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category\n\n**Zhuangzi**\nNarrated by Luo Miandao of Luling Bamboo Peak\n\nZhuangzi was a man of Song, named Zhou, styled Zixiu. Born in Meng County of Suiyang, he once served as an officer in the Meng Lacquer Garden. His learning spanned all fields, yet its essence returned to the words of Laozi. Thus, he composed a work of over one hundred thousand characters, largely employing parables. His language flowed boundlessly, following his own inclinations, so that even kings and great ministers could not contain him.\n\nKing Wei of Chu, hearing of Zhuang Zhou’s worthiness, dispatched envoys with generous gifts to welcome him, offering the position of chief minister. Zhou laughed and said to the messengers: \"A thousand gold pieces are a weighty profit; the post of minister is a lofty rank. Have you alone not seen the sacrificial ox at the suburban rites? Reared for years, clad in embroidered robes, and led into the grand ancestral temple—at that moment, if it wished to be a lone piglet, could it do so? Begone swiftly, and do not defile me. I would rather wander and play in the filth, free and joyful, than be fettered by rulers. He never entered official service, fulfilling his own aspirations to the end.\"\n\nThe Tang dynasty posthumously enfeoffed him as the Perfected of Southern Florescence, and his book was titled *The Southern Florescence True Classic*.\n\n**Explanation of the Title in *The Southern Florescence True Classic: A Return to the Root***\n\nThough Zhuangzi’s writings are vast, uncanny, and strange, drifting beyond the Six Classics, they resemble heaven and earth, sun and moon—possessing constant principles and movements—yet wind and clouds open and close, spirits and ghosts transform, all of which cannot be lacking. Scholars of past and present have always marveled at them, yet their phrasing and diction belong to the language of the late Zhou, beyond the full comprehension of later ages.\n\nNevertheless, some passages remain verifiable. For instance, the questions of *Zheng* and *Huo* to the market supervisor regarding the measurement of hides correspond to the *Grand Archery* officers *Zheng* and *Huo* (see *The Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial*). The explanation of the ox with a white forehead, the pig with an upturned snout, and the man with hemorrhoids—none fit for the river—refers to the ancient Son of Heaven’s springtime expiatory sacrifices (see *The Han Treatise on Suburban Sacrifices*). *Tangzi* was the son of the *Chief of the Hall*, just as the legitimate son of the Zhou royal clan was called *Gate Master*. *Yitai* (Righteous Terrace) is *Yitai* (Ceremonial Terrace). Zheng Sinong said: \"In old texts, *yi* (ceremony) was written as *yi* (righteousness).\" The *doujian* (neck and shoulder) appears in *The Artificers’ Record*. The carpenter’s marking of the sounding stone’s hollows and numbers refers to *gu* (inspection), where *doujian* is the *gu* character. Such examples are numerous.\n\nWithout ancient learning, scholars cannot grasp these allusions. Many commentators either expound with empty discourse, drag in Chan Buddhist terms, or forcibly attach Confucian orthodox principles—most of which miss the original text’s intent.",

      "translated_text": "Slowly I remark: The marvelous subtleties of this text are peerless—yet who truly recognizes its wonder? Across the desolate span of eighteen hundred years, the author’s intent has remained pent-up and unexpressed, while plagiarists’ misapplications have only multiplied errors. Is this not a lamentable omission in the annals of cursive script?\n\nFortunately, I, Mian Dao, retired early to leisure, entrusting my aspirations to purity and emptiness. Thus, I found time to comb through a few passages with my humble insights, setting brush to paper until, unawares, a volume took shape. I dare hope this effort follows the original intent, and so I title it *Following the Root of the Zhuangzi*.\n\n*Following the Root of the Southern Florescence True Scripture*, Scroll One\nBy Lu Ling’s Bamboo Peak, Luo Mian Dao\nCollated by Disciple Peng Xiang\n\n**Inner Chapters: Free and Easy Wandering**\nTo wander freely without constraint—this is called *xiaoyaoyou* (free and easy wandering). Zhuangzi sought to inspire those who would study the Dao, and thus began with this title.\n\nThe Inner, Outer, and Miscellaneous Chapters are like sequential collections, with no fundamental difference in meaning. According to the *Han Arts and Letters*, the *Zhuangzi* originally comprised fifty-two chapters. Guo Xiang had already discerned that thirteen parts were cunningly spurious, leaving the extant thirty-three. Su Shi of the Eastern Slope later excised *Yielding the Throne*, *Robber Zhi*, *Discoursing on the Sword*, and *The Old Fisherman*, merging *Liezi* with the end of *Giving Away the Throne* into a single chapter—his judgment was precise. Yet I still deem *Refining the Will* and *Mending the Nature* superficial and inauthentic, and thus propose fixing the total at twenty-six chapters.\n\nThe Inner Chapters all establish their titles first, and the text’s meaning does not stray from them. The Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters merely extract the opening characters for their names, for the Inner Chapters’ intent suffices, while the Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters merely elaborate upon it.\n\n**In the northern darkness there is a fish, and his name is Kun.**\nThe vastness of Kun—who knows how many thousand *li* he spans? He transforms into a bird, and his name is Peng. The back of Peng—who knows how many thousand *li* it stretches? Roused to flight, his wings hang like clouds suspended from the sky. This bird, when the seas surge, will journey to the southern darkness. The southern darkness is the Celestial Pond.\n\nThe northern and southern darknesses are not merely the northern and southern seas, but the polar extremes of the sea, so distant and obscure that they are called *ming* (darkness). Kun, according to the *Erya*, is the general term for all fish roe, hence the *Nei Ze*’s \"roe sauce\" is read as *kun*. The *Lu Language* also states: \"In fish prohibitions, *kun* and *fu* both refer to fish roe.\" Zhuangzi takes the tiniest and makes it vast—this is the beginning of his playful absurdity. Peng does not appear in the classics. The *Island Barbarians’ Records* notes: \"In the layered lands of Kunlun, there is often a great Peng whose flight blots out the sun and can devour camels. A man once gathered a fallen Peng wing and cut its quill into a water bucket.\" Kun’s size is said to span \"who knows how many thousand *li*,\" and Peng’s back likewise—truly, the greater the substance, the greater its transformation.\n\n\"Roused to flight\" means mustering its fury to take off. \"When the seas surge, it will journey to the southern darkness\": *yun* (surge) means *dong* (movement). When typhoons arise, the sea’s *qi* stirs, and the bird migrates to avoid them. The *Lu Language* states: \"The *yuanju* bird halted outside the eastern gate of Lu for three days.\" Zhan Qin remarked: \"This year, the sea must be bracing for disaster.\" For the birds and beasts of great rivers all know to evade calamity. That year, the seas were beset by great winds, and the winter was unseasonably warm—this is the event in question.\n\nThe Celestial Pond is where the sea meets the sky, like the \"pond\" in \"bathing in the Salty Pond.\" A *chi* (pond) is where fish and birds alight; Peng’s alighting place is this pond. It is called the southern darkness, the Celestial Pond. Elsewhere it says: \"North of the barren lands, there is a dark sea, the Celestial Pond.\" For the term *minghai* (dark sea) still does not fully convey its remoteness, so it is further specified as the Celestial Pond, revealing it as the place where the sea meets the sky. This shows Peng’s flight from the northernmost sea to the southernmost, spanning such vast distances.\n\nThe opening speaks of Kun transforming into Peng, able to soar high and migrate far, drawing an analogy to humans transforming into sages or spirits, achieving the ultimate and attaining *xiaoyaoyou*. The word *hua* (transformation) appears at the outset; at first glance, it seems unremarkable, but upon closer reading, one realizes its indispensability.\n\n**The *Qi Xie* is a record of anomalies.**\nIts words state: \"When Peng journeys to the southern darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, ascends on the whirlwind to ninety thousand *li*, and departs with the six-month *xi* (breath).\" The *Qi Xie* is a book of Qi proverbs. Mencius said: \"The words of Qi’s rustics,\" so it is fitting that Qi customs would produce such proverbial sayings. The *Qi Xie*’s words are proverbial. Zhuangzi, though himself full of strange tales, calls the *Qi Xie* a \"record of anomalies\"—this is another instance of his playful absurdity.\n\n*Ji* (strike) means to beat. As Peng’s *qi* and momentum take flight, waves surge to a height of three thousand *li*. *Bo* (ascend) means to follow the wind’s circular motion. *Fuyao* (whirlwind) is a cyclone. The wind’s force lifts it in a spiraling ascent—hence the phrase \"the branches of the sea-bound whirlwind\" also draws from this meaning. \"Ninety thousand *li*\" refers to the distance from the northern darkness to the sky; from the Central Lands to the zenith, the distance would be even greater. According to the *Kao Ling Yao*: \"The celestial sphere spans 365¼ degrees, each degree measuring 2,932 *li* and 1,461/348 *li*. The circumference is 1,071,000 *li*. Taking the ratio of circumference to diameter as three to one, the diameter is 357,000 *li*—this is the diameter of the twenty-eight constellations’ circuit. Beyond the twenty-eight constellations, above, below, east, and west each extend 15,000 *li*, forming the four polar extremes, called the *sibiao* (four limits). Within the four limits and including the constellations, the total diameter is 387,000 *li*. The exact center of the sky is thus 193,500 *li*.\"",
      "overlap_context": "* (righteousness).\" The *doujian* (neck and shoulder) appears in *The Artificers’ Record*. The carpenter’s marking of the sounding stone’s hollows and numbers refers to *gu* (inspection), where *doujian* is the *gu* character. Such examples are numerous.\n\nWithout ancient learning, scholars cannot grasp these allusions. Many commentators either expound with empty discourse, drag in Chan Buddhist terms, or forcibly attach Confucian orthodox principles—most of which miss the original text’s intent.",

      "translated_text": "The earth lies at the center, with a thickness of thirty thousand *li*. At the spring equinox, the earth is precisely at the center. From this point, it gradually descends, and by the summer solstice, it has sunk fifteen thousand *li*, so that its upper edge aligns with the midpoint of the sky. After the summer solstice, the earth gradually rises again, and by the autumn equinox, it returns to the exact center of the sky. From there, it continues to ascend, and by the winter solstice, it has risen fifteen thousand *li*, so that its lower edge aligns with the midpoint of the sky. After the winter solstice, the earth gradually descends once more, perpetually ascending and descending within the span of thirty thousand *li*. The theory of the *siyou* (four movements) originally derives from the *Zhou Bei* text; whether the scholars of the armillary sphere acknowledge its validity remains uncertain, but their calculations of celestial degrees and terrestrial distances appear reliable. Furthermore, Zheng Xuan’s commentary on the *Rites of Zhou* employs the *gougu* method to measure the shadow of a gnomon, yielding 81,394 *li*, 30 *bu*, 5 *chi*, and 3 *cun* with 6 *fen*—this being the distance from the point directly beneath the sun to the earth, which is half the diameter of the sky. As for the phrase \"after six months of rest,\" it refers to the roc’s migration from the Northern Darkness to the Southern Darkness, traversing half the circumference of the sky, hence requiring only half a year of rest before pausing, demonstrating that the roc’s flight aligns with celestial measurements. The preceding passage speaks only of the distance of the roc’s migration; this section further proves the height of its flight. The initial statement of \"ninety thousand *li*\" is placed here, with the explanation following thereafter.\n\n\"Wild horses,\" \"dust,\" and \"living creatures blown by the breath\"—is the deep blue of the sky its true color? Or is it so distant that it has no limit? When viewed from above, it appears the same. *Xi* (息) means *qi*. \"Wild horses\" and \"dust\" are metaphors for the drifting *qi*. Zhang Zai of Hengqu said: \"The *qi* surges and swirls through the Great Void, ascending, descending, and soaring without cease. This is what the *Yi* calls *kunyi*, and what Zhuangzi refers to as 'living creatures blown by the breath'—is this not the 'wild horses'?\" Zhu Xi of Hui’an remarked: \"The Way of Qian forms the male, and the Way of Kun forms the female—this is the tumult of drifting *qi*.\" *Cangcang* (苍苍) is the color seen from afar. *Yi* (已) means \"to cease.\" This merely explains the phrase \"ninety thousand *li*.\" It warns against mistaking the drifting *qi*’s deep blue for the sky’s ultimate boundary, thereby doubting the existence of ninety thousand *li*. Thus, it clarifies that what appears in the Great Void like \"wild horses\" and \"dust\" is the creative power of nature, which uses this *qi* to animate living things. Humans, confined within this *qi*, remain unaware of it, perceiving only a distant, deep blue. Now, when we look up, is that deep blue the sky’s true color? Or is there still an infinite expanse beyond? Since the blue extends endlessly upward, the roc can ascend ninety thousand *li*. From above, looking down, the same deep blue appears—this is the realm of the tangible earth. It ceases here; no further ascent is possible. For the blue above is not like the blue below, which cannot be traversed. Du Meng of the Han said: \"The sky has no substance; when gazed upon, it is boundlessly high and distant, beyond the limits of human vision. Thus, it appears deep blue, which aligns with this passage.\" The phrase \"then it is so\" (*ze yi yi*) is often misread as \"and that is all\" (*er yi yi*), disrupting the coherence of the preceding and following text.\n\nAs for the transition—where passages often begin with phrases like \"furthermore\" (*qie fu*) or \"allow me to explain\" (*qing shi yan zhi*), recognizing this mechanism ensures the text remains unbroken—\n\nIf water is not deep, it lacks the strength to bear a great vessel. Pour a cup of water onto a level floor, and a mustard seed may serve as a boat; place a cup there, and it will stick fast, for the water is shallow and the vessel too large. If wind is not deep, it lacks the strength to bear great wings. Thus, at ninety thousand *li*, the wind lies beneath, and only then can one ride the wind. With the azure sky at one’s back and no obstacle to block the way, only then can one set course for the south.\n\n*Aotang* (坳堂) refers to a depression in the floor of a hall. \"A mustard seed as a boat\" means the seed floats like a vessel. *Pei* (培) means \"to accumulate.\" The \"azure sky\" is not the deep blue seen from below; only at ninety thousand *li* does the true azure appear. The preceding text states that deep blue is not the sky’s true color, so it is clear that azure is the true color. The Six Classics never speak of the \"azure sky,\" only the \"deep-blue sky,\" for they describe only what is visible. This further explains why the roc must fly to ninety thousand *li*: it requires the vast power of the wind to migrate so far. Water is likened to wind, and the vessel to the roc. If water is not deep, it cannot bear a great vessel; if wind is not deep, it cannot bear great wings. Thus, at ninety thousand *li*, the wind lies beneath, its force vast and abundant, and with the azure sky at one’s back, the celestial path is open and unobstructed. Only by harnessing this wind can the roc set course for the south. *Nai jin* (乃今) refers to the moment of migration. The following passage, \"and then it heads for the Southern Darkness,\" describes the completion of the journey.\n\nThis section describes the marvelous transformations of the *kun*-roc, citing the *Qi Xie* to prove its flight of ninety thousand *li*, and the passage on \"wild horses\" to clarify the principle behind reaching such heights. The cicada and the *yujiao* bird laughed at it, saying: \"I burst forth and fly, striking the elm and sandalwood; sometimes I do not reach them and simply fall to the ground—why go ninety thousand *li* to the south?\"\n\nThe *tiao* (蜩) is a black, cicada-like creature that sings in the fifth month; the *chan* (蝉) is mottled and sings after the seventh month; the *diaoliao* (蛁蟟) is green—there are many varieties. Commonly, they are all called cicadas, or *qianglang*, or water insects, or the transformations of *qicao* from dung. The *yujiao* (鸴鸠) is a bird originally named for its resemblance to the mountain magpie, hence called *hongjiu*. The *Monthly Ordinances* states: \"The *mingjiu* bird smooths its feathers.\" The commentary by Guo Pu cites: \"It resembles a mountain magpie but is smaller, with a short tail, dark blue-black, and very vocal. In the Jiangdong region, it is called *guzhuo* (鹘鸼).\"",

      "translated_text": "The *Monthly Ordinances* states that in the second month of spring, the hawk transforms into the *jiu*; the *Royal Regulations* states that in the second month of autumn, the *jiu* transforms into the hawk. The *Zuozhuan* mentions the *Shuangjiu* clan, with Du’s commentary identifying it as the hawk. Since these two creatures transform into one another, the *jiu* may also be called the hawk. These two insects, small and capable of transformation, are thus contrasted with the *kun* and *peng*. \"To rise with decision\" means to take flight with all one’s strength, akin to the resolve in decisive battle. *Qiang* means to collide or strike. *Yu* and *fang* are the names of two trees. \"Sometimes I do not reach them and simply fall to the ground\"—at times, even the *yu* and *fang* are beyond my reach, and I must descend to the earth. This describes how the two insects cannot fly high, serving as the *tiao* and *jiu*’s mockery of the *peng*. How is one who ridicules the great Dao from a narrow perspective any different? One who travels to the *mangcang* returns after a day’s journey with a full belly; one who journeys a hundred *li* must prepare provisions the night before; one who travels a thousand *li* must gather supplies for three months. What do these two insects know? *Mangcang* refers to the distant haze, where the land appears green in a single glance. *Guo* describes a full belly, or courage—when the stomach is full, one is bold; when hungry, one is timid. The two insects are the *tiao* and *jiu*. The farther one travels, the more provisions one must accumulate; the broader the *peng*’s wings, the thicker the wind it must gather. What can these two insects possibly understand? Small knowledge does not reach great knowledge; short years do not reach long years. Both instances of *zhi* (知) are read in the level tone, linking the preceding and following phrases—a common stylistic device in Zhuangzi’s writing. The reason these two insects mock the *peng* is simply that their small understanding does not reach the *peng*’s great understanding. Thus, short and long years are used to illustrate small and great knowledge.\n\nHow do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows not the waxing and waning of the moon; the *huigū* knows not spring and autumn—these are short-lived creatures. South of Chu lies the *Mingling*, which takes five hundred years as its spring and five hundred years as its autumn. In high antiquity, there was the great *chun* tree, which takes eight thousand years as its spring and eight thousand years as its autumn. Yet Pengzu alone is renowned for his longevity—how pitiful it is that common people compare themselves to him! The *jun* is a ground fungus; the large ones are called *zhongdao*, while the small ones are called *jun*. The *jun*’s lifespan is measured in mornings, hence the term \"morning mushroom.\" The *huigū* is also a type of cicada. Zheng’s *Comprehensive Records* states: \"The *hanman*, properly called *huigū*, sings plaintively in the ninth and tenth months.\" Xiaoshan says: \"The *huigū* cries *zijiuzijiu*, and at year’s end, it has nothing to rely on.\" The *huigū* Zhuangzi refers to as knowing not spring and autumn is the small, purple-green cicada of the fourth and fifth months. *Ming* refers to the Southern Darkness; *ling* refers to the spirit turtle. The unicorn, phoenix, turtle, and dragon are called the Four Spirits. The *Mingling* is the spirit turtle of the Dark Sea. The morning mushroom and the great *chun* tree, the *huigū* and the *Mingling*, are presented as one plant and one animal in parallel—thus, it is clear that the *Mingling* is not a plant. \"Five hundred years as spring, five hundred years as autumn\"—the *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"A thousand-year-old turtle measures one foot and two inches.\" Two sets of five hundred years make up the thousand-year count. \"Eight thousand years as spring, eight thousand years as autumn\"—the character *chun* (椿) is split into two *eight* and *hundred*, multiplied by ten to yield two sets of eight thousand.

One day, under a clear sky without thunder, the pond roared like a storm, and all the fish leapt upward in a spiral like ram's horns, vanishing without a trace.\" Both accounts capture the essence of Zhuangzi’s original meaning.\n\n\"Piercing the clouds at ninety thousand *li*\"—at such heights, the clouds lie far below. \"Barren land\" refers to the saline-alkali flats, as in the *Book of Documents*: \"the vast saline shores by the sea.\" The *yan* (鴳) is a quail, akin to the sparrow and cicada. Fan’s commentary cites the *Rites of the Duke of Zhou*, identifying the *yan* as a quail. Li Xun notes: \"The *ru* (鴽) is the *yan*, which is the quail.\" The *Monthly Ordinances* of late spring state: \"Field mice transform into quails.\" Thus, the *yan* is but a minor transformation, hence its comparison to the cicada and turtledove.\n\nMoreover, Zhuangzi turns to the seashore to find a creature of slight transformation, illustrating how the cicada and turtledove mock the Peng. The turtledove, in its transformation, has lost its predatory instincts, while the cicada, barely freed from the mire, flits low between the elm and sandalwood, devoid of far-reaching vision. Their mockery is thus unsurprising—like rustic villagers who know nothing of great lords and sages.\n\nThough the barren-land quail is small in nature, confined to mugwort and wormwood, it dwells by the sea, where the vastness of the cosmos and the boundlessness of wind and moon are ever before its eyes. Yet even it presumptuously ridicules the great Peng. In human terms, this mirrors those who, though they walk in the footsteps of sages, remain incorrigibly foolish, abandoning all hope of self-improvement.\n\nThe passage from *Tang’s Inquiry of Ji* that follows gathers the threads of the preceding text. The earlier account from *Qi Xie’s Records of the Strange* now gives way to *Tang’s Inquiry of Ji*, which presents the matter as factual. Previously, the size of the Kun was said to span \"several thousand *li*,\" here its breadth is confirmed as \"several thousand *li*.\" Earlier, the Peng’s back was described as \"several thousand *li*,\" here it is likened to \"a great mountain.\" Where before it was said to \"beat the whirling winds and rise,\" here the phrase \"ram’s horns\" is added to depict its form.\n\nThis section expounds on the minor transformations of the cicada, turtledove, and barren-land quail, which mock the Peng’s ascent of ninety thousand *li*. The phrase \"ninety thousand *li*\" appears four times, with the primary aim of elucidating this line. It underscores that the Celestial Lake truly lies ninety thousand *li* from the heavens. The vastness of the void is boundless, and the spirit roams unobstructed, shattering the shallow, cramped views of the worldly and broadening the heart’s capacity for freedom.\n\nThus, the first passage sets forth a parable, while this section turns to a discussion of human nature.",

      "translated_text": "Those who take pride in fulfilling a single office, matching their conduct to a single village, aligning their virtue with a single lord, or winning the trust of a single state—such men regard themselves no differently than the cicada, turtledove, or barren-land quail. What sets them apart from those small-minded creatures? Yet even Song Rongzi would laugh at them.\n\nMoreover, when the whole world praises him, he feels no added encouragement; when the whole world condemns him, he feels no added discouragement. He has settled the distinction between inner and outer, discerned the boundary between honor and disgrace—this alone suffices. In his dealings with the world, he is not restless or eager. Still, he has yet to establish himself fully.\n\nThe phrase \"yet even\" describes his mocking demeanor, akin to the sense of \"still.\" The earlier group mocked the great with the small; Song Rongzi, in turn, mocks them by mocking the small with the great. Not only can he laugh at the former group, but he also embodies what follows. \"Not restless or eager\" means he is not anxious, while \"establish\" means to stand firm. Song Rongzi is not swayed by others’ praise or blame; the division of inner and outer, the boundary of honor and disgrace, are clear in his heart. He believes his self-possession is sufficient. Though he is not anxious about worldly affairs, he has yet to stand firm in solitude.\n\nLiezi could ride the wind and travel, soaring lightly and skillfully, returning only after fifteen days. Yet even he, in seeking good fortune, was not restless or eager. Though he avoided walking, he still depended on something. But one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth, harnesses the transformations of the six qi, and roams boundlessly—what does he depend on?\n\n\"Lightly\" conveys the clarity of the wind; \"skillfully\" means he excels at it. \"Fifteen days\" refers to half a month, a span far briefer than the Peng’s half-year breath. \"Seeking good fortune\" means he relies on the wind to travel, and the wind’s rising is his fortune. \"Not restless or eager\" means he is not anxious to obtain the wind as his fortune.\n\nOne who rides is the master, while one who harnesses is the assistant. The constancy of Heaven and Earth is the Supreme Ultimate moving to generate yang and settling to generate yin. What humans receive to live is called by Daoists the \"primordial qi.\" The six qi—yin and yang, wind and rain, darkness and light—include the Jueyin wind-wood, Shaoyin sovereign fire, Shaoyang ministerial fire, Taiyin damp-earth, Yangming dry-metal, and Taiyang cold-water. Though their names differ, their essence is the same, dispersed throughout Heaven and Earth and present within the human body.\n\nTo take constancy as the master and the six qi as the harness is akin to Laozi’s image of thirty spokes sharing one hub. Liezi surpasses Song Rongzi, yet he still depends on something. This group has yet to achieve complete transformation. But one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth, harnesses the transformations of the six qi, and spirit-roams without limit—all is drawn from within, so what need is there for external dependence? At this stage, all is transformed.\n\nThe following passage refers to those who attain this:\n\nThus, the perfected person has no self, the spirit-person has no merit, the sage has no fame.\n\nPrevious interpretations mistakenly treat these three lines as a conclusion to the above, but they actually introduce what follows. Having described two groups whose transformations are limited, this passage now turns to three groups whose transformations are vast. To be great and transformed is called sageliness; to be sagely and unfathomable is called spirit; the ultimate is called perfection. These three ranks also have degrees of depth. Without merit, there is no achievement, and thus no fame. Without self, even the self vanishes—how then could there be achievement?\n\nThe following passages provide evidence for each:\n\nXu You is a sage; the ethereal immortals of Mount Gushe are spirit-persons; the four masters are perfected persons.\n\nWhen Yao offered the world to Xu You, he said: \"The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for it to shine? The timely rain has fallen, yet you still irrigate—is it not laborious to bring moisture? You stand and the world is ordered, yet I still occupy your place. I see my own inadequacy—please, let me yield the world to you.\"\n\nXu You replied: \"You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. If I were to replace you, would I do so for fame? Fame is but the guest of reality—would I become a guest?\"",

      "translated_text": "He said: \"On the distant Mount Miaogu—*Miaogu* as in Song Guangping’s *Rhapsody on the Plum Blossom*, where it is glossed as *ye*—there dwells a spirit-person. Their skin is like ice and snow, their bearing supple as a maiden’s. They eat no grain, but drink the wind and sip the dew. They ride the clouds and qi, mount flying dragons, and roam beyond the four seas. Their spirit is so concentrated that they keep things free from blight and pestilence, and the yearly harvests ripen.\n\nI deem this mad and unbelievable.\"\n\nLian Shu said: \"Just as the blind cannot partake in the sight of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums, is it only the body that can be blind and deaf? The mind, too, may suffer such afflictions. These words of his are like *this maiden here*—these eight characters form a single phrase.\n\nThat person, that power of theirs, sweeps across the ten thousand things to unify them. The world seeks order, yet who would exhaust themselves over the affairs of the world? That person—nothing harms them. Though the great floods rise to the heavens, they do not drown; though great droughts melt metal and stone and scorch the mountains, they do not burn. Their dust and husks could still mold and cast a Yao or Shun—who would trouble themselves with worldly affairs?\n\nThe names of persons in Zhuangzi’s words may be real or fictitious; we cannot know whether Jian Wu and Lian Shu were historical, but Jie Yu was the Madman of Chu. Hence the following line: *I deem this mad and unbelievable.* ‘Going forth but never returning’ means speaking without ever looking back. *Jing* is the path before the gate; *ting* is the ground outside the hall. *Greatly divergent* means that while the path and courtyard are not far apart, Jie Yu’s words differ so vastly from ordinary speech that they seem as distant as the path is from the courtyard.\n\nMount Miaogu appears in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. *Naoyue* means pure and refined. *Chuzi* means maiden. *They keep things free from blight and pestilence, and the yearly harvests ripen* describes the transformative influence of their presence. *These words of his are like this maiden here*—these eight characters should be read as a single phrase, referring to Jie Yu. *You* means ‘like’; *shi* means ‘this’; *nü* means maiden, continuing the earlier description of the spirit-person’s bearing as *supple as a maiden’s*. As in the following line, where the word *yan* (words) is followed by *ye* (is), this is a rhetorical softening—reading it as two separate phrases would be incorrect.\n\n*Bangbo* is the sound of rolling stones, describing their power to set the ten thousand things in motion. *Seeking order* means desiring governance. *Bibi* means weary and burdened. *Dust and husks could still mold and cast a Yao or Shun*—what Yao and Shun attained was what the spirit-person discards. This speaks of the spirit-person’s lack of merit. It is said, *there dwells a spirit-person*, and again, *they keep things free from blight and pestilence, and the yearly harvests ripen*; *sweeps across the ten thousand things to unify them*; *the world seeks order*—all speak of merit.\n\nThe people of Song took ceremonial caps to Yue, but the Yue people cut their hair and tattooed their bodies, having no use for them. When Yao governed the people of the world and brought peace to the seas, he went to see the Four Masters on Mount Miaogu by the north bank of the Fen River, and there he was so overwhelmed that he forgot his rule over the world. The Four Masters need not be identified by name. Fenyang was Yao’s capital. After meeting the Four Masters on Mount Miaogu, Yao returned to the north bank of the Fen River, where he was as if bereft of his rule over the world—seeing the Four Masters had made him lose himself.\n\nThis first presents an analogy: the Yue people cut their hair and tattoo their bodies, so what use do they have for the ceremonial caps of Song? The Four Masters lived in reclusion in the mountains—what did they care for Yao’s governance? This speaks of the perfected person’s selflessness. The Four Masters knew no self, and when Yao saw them, he too lost what was his own.\n\nHui Shi said to Zhuangzi: \"The King of Wei gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to hold five *dan*. When filled with water or broth, its strength was not enough to lift itself. I split it open to make ladles, but they were too shallow and wobbled, holding little. Was it not vast and hollow? Yet I smashed it for its uselessness.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"You are truly inept at putting great things to use. There was a man of Song skilled in making an unchapping salve, and his family made their living for generations by washing and bleaching silk floss. A traveler heard of it and offered a hundred gold pieces for the recipe. The family gathered and deliberated: ‘We have washed and bleached silk floss for generations, earning only a few pieces of gold. Now we can sell this skill for a hundred gold in a single morning—let us give it to him.’ The traveler obtained it and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue raised a rebellion, the King of Wu made him a general. In winter, they fought on the water, and he routed the Yue forces. The king then enfeoffed him with land. The same ability to prevent chapping hands led one to a fief and another to a life of washing silk floss—the difference lay in how it was used.\n\nNow you have a gourd that holds five *dan*—why not consider making it into a great float and drifting upon the rivers and lakes? Instead, you fret that it is too shallow and wobbles, holding little. Then your mind is still like the tangled *peng* plant—bound to the thickets of the hills and marshes, unable to float upon the rivers and lakes.\"\n\nThis speaks of the use of a single vessel not yet transformed—if one were to float upon the rivers and lakes, it would be transformed.\n\nHui Shi said to Zhuangzi: \"I have a great tree—people call it the *chu*. Its trunk is gnarled and swollen, not fitting the inked line; its branches are twisted and curled, not fitting the compass or square. It stands by the road, but carpenters do not glance at it. Now your words are vast but useless—everyone rejects them alike.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Have you never seen the wildcat or the weasel? The *li sheng* is the weasel, shaped like a flying squirrel, reddish-yellow, with a large tail. It can devour mice—commonly called the *mouse-catcher*.\"",

Leaping east and west, it bounds without regard for high or low, only to be caught in the snare’s trap—*pi* (entering the mechanism, as if subjected to punishment). It dies in the hunter’s net.\n\nNow consider the *li* ox—its size like clouds hanging from the heavens. This creature may be great, yet it cannot catch mice. The *li sheng*, though small, can capture prey but instead meets harm. The ox, vast yet unable to seize mice, preserves its life. Now you possess a great tree—why not plant it in the land of Nothing Whatever, the boundless wilds? Wander idly by its side, recline carefree beneath its shade. Unfelled by axes, untouched by harm, though of no use—where then lies its suffering?\n\nThis speaks of the use of a single tree not yet transformed—if one were to plant it in the land of Nothing Whatever, the boundless wilds, it would be transformed.\n\nThis chapter, titled \"Free and Easy Wandering,\" is threaded throughout by a single character: *transformation*. The first section describes the transformations of the *kun*-peng, the cicada, the fledgling dove, and the quail—each differing in scale, and thus their flight in height and depth. The second section speaks of human transformation, which likewise varies in magnitude, and thus the quality of their free and easy wandering. The third section shows that one may transform the useless into the useful and thereby achieve free and easy wandering.\n\nFor what Heaven bestows is fixed in measure—how could the cicada, fledgling dove, or quail be forced to match the *kun*-peng? Yet among humans, whether wise or foolish, worthy or unworthy, all may ascend the great Dao. Some, however, see themselves as the cicada, fledgling dove, or quail. Thus, at the chapter’s end, it is made clear: though one may resemble the hollow gourd, too frail to lift, or the *chu* tree—gnarled, swollen, and twisted—if one adapts to one’s nature and transforms with circumstance, how could one fail to achieve free and easy wandering?\n\n*The Classic of Southern Florescence, Following the Original Text, Scroll the First* (concluded)\n*The Classic of Southern Florescence, Following the Original Text, Scroll the Second*",

      "translated_text": "**Lu Lingzhu Peak’s Luo Miandao, Recorded by Disciple Peng Xiang (Collated Text)**\n\n**Inner Chapters: On the Equality of Things (Part One)**\n\nDuring the Warring States period, scholarship was in disarray, and disputes over right and wrong swarmed like bees. The ways of the world and the hearts of men had sunk into deep delusion. Confucians sought to silence heterodox doctrines and bar perverse conduct to safeguard the Way of the former sages. The teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, however, simply preserved their innate nature, never contending with others. Affirming what was right because it was right, rejecting what was wrong because it was wrong—thus, by allowing their inequalities to find their own equilibrium, they achieved harmony.\n\nThis chapter largely engages with Master Gongsun Long, addressing questions such as \"Is this right because that is wrong?\" or \"Is this wrong because that is right?\"—debates over \"white horses are not horses,\" the hardness and whiteness of stone, and the sameness or difference of things, all of which stem from Gongsun Long’s arguments.\n\nNanguo Ziqi leaned against his armrest, sat in stillness, lifted his gaze to the heavens, and exhaled deeply. His breath issued forth with a sound like *ta*, as if he had lost his other half. Nanguo Ziqi’s posture—leaning low over the armrest—was one of deep repose. *Xu* describes the act of opening the mouth to release breath; *ta* signifies the closing of the lips. One moment he bowed forward over the armrest, the next he tilted his head back to exhale, then suddenly closed his mouth. In an instant, three transformations unfolded, vivid as a painting. \"Losing his other half\" refers to the spirit’s pairing with form; here, he had cast off ears, eyes, and bodily frame as if dead.\n\nYan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, \"What is this state you have entered?\" Could one’s form truly be made like withered wood, and one’s heart like dead ashes? The one who now leans upon the armrest is not the same as the one who did so before.\n\nYan Cheng Ziyou was a disciple of Ziqin, surnamed Yan, given name Yan, styled Ziyou, posthumously honored as Cheng. The word \"could\" expresses his astonishment at the possibility. He marveled that a person’s form and heart could be brought to such a state, finding it both strange and admirable. The \"before\" refers to the moment when Ziqi leaned upon the armrest and gazed heavenward—then, he had seemed alive; now, he appeared as if dead.\n\nZiqi replied, \"Yan, is it not fitting that you ask this? Is it not fitting that I, in this state, should be questioned? Now, I have lost myself—do you understand?\" The *shen* (spirit) is \"I,\" the *xing* (form) is \"me.\" Though *wu* (I), *wo* (me), and *ji* (self) may seem interchangeable, *wo* and *ji* still carry a sense of personal attachment. Thus, Confucius spoke of \"overcoming the self\" when instructing Yan Yuan. Daoist cultivation refines the primordial spirit, regarding the body as something to be cast aside. In the moment when Ziqi’s breath issued forth with *ta*, his spirit withdrew into stillness, and both body and heart dissolved. Hence, he said, \"Now, I have lost myself.\" The question \"Do you understand?\" was Ziqi’s way of turning the inquiry back to Ziyou, then proceeding to explain.\n\n\"You have heard the *lai* of man but not the *lai* of earth; you have heard the *lai* of earth but not the *lai* of heaven. The *lai* of man leads to the *lai* of earth, and the *lai* of earth leads to the *lai* of heaven. If you were to hear the discourse on the *lai* of earth and heaven, you would understand why I have lost myself.\"\n\nZiyou said, \"May I ask the method?\"\n\nZiqi replied, \"The great clod—when it exhales its breath, called wind, nothing stirs. But when it stirs, the myriad hollows roar in fury. Have you alone never heard the long, sighing gusts? The great clod is heaven and earth. *Canliao* is the sound of the ceaseless wind, which, when prolonged, reaches far and wide. The mountain forests bend and sway, the great trees of a hundred spans hollowed with cavities—some like noses, some like mouths, some like ears, some like beams, some like rings, some like mortars. Noses, mouths, and ears resemble human forms; beams are stacked with gaps; rings are round and hollow within; mortars are sunken in the center—these resemble the shapes of vessels. Some resemble *jia* (pools), some resemble *wu* (puddles). *Jia* are where water gathers in ox tracks; *wu* are where water flows into depressions—these resemble the forms of earth. Some sounds are rushing, some whistling, some hissing, some inhaling, some wailing, some howling, some deep, some shrill. The first group describes shapes; this group describes sounds. *Ji* is like the rush of water; *xiao* is like the whir of an arrow in flight; *chi* is like a shout; *xi* is like a gasp; *jiao* is like a cry; *hao* is like a lament; *yao* is like a deep murmur; *yao* is like the caw of a crow. The first sounds lead, and the following sounds respond. *Yu* and *gan* are interchangeable—Han Fei said, \"The *gan* is the chief of the five notes.\" *Yu* describes the chorus of hollows, like fish mouths gaping in unison. A gentle breeze brings a faint harmony; a whirlwind brings a mighty harmony. When the fierce wind subsides, all the hollows fall silent.\n\nThe words \"leading\" and \"responding\" illustrate the nature of *lai*. Have you alone never seen the *tiaotiao* and *diaodiao*? *Tiaotiao* and *diaodiao* describe the swaying of treetops in the wind, a gentle, trembling motion. Today, people colloquially call a light breeze \"the *tiaotiao* wind.\" Tea-pickers refer to tender shoots as *diao*, plucking them with a *diaodiao* motion. This passage describes the *lai* of earth: when the wind rises, there are many sounds; when it ceases, all is suddenly still. Human life is just like this—this leads into the following discussion.\n\nZiyou said, \"The *lai* of earth is the chorus of the myriad hollows; the *lai* of man is the harmony of pipes and flutes. May I ask about the *lai* of heaven?\"\n\nZiqi replied, \"The wind blows in ten thousand different ways, yet each finds its own tone and measure. All things take their forms as they will—who is it that stirs them to anger?\" The word \"self\" here corresponds to the earlier \"me.\" Heaven’s generation of things is like the blowing of the wind. To depict the *lai* of heaven, the text employs the word \"blow.\" Though the wind blows in ten thousand different ways, it allows each to arise as if of its own accord, with the Creator having no part in it. All these manifold transformations are self-generated, their forceful emergence—who, then, is responsible?",

      "translated_text": "As the Mohists deem the Confucians wrong, they naturally regard themselves as right. The Confucians, in turn, regard themselves as right and thus deem the Mohists wrong. Each affirms what the other denies and denies what the other affirms—this is the root of the endless disputes between the Confucians and Mohists. To further clarify: rather than striving to affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms, it is better to illumine one’s true master—meaning, to attend to one’s own cultivation and cease idle disputation over right and wrong.\n\nThe preceding passage concludes: \"Human life is inherently thus obscured.\" If I alone am obscured, do others not also suffer the same obscurity? Thus, this passage concludes: \"nothing is better than illumination.\" Illumination means knowing where the true master resides; the obscured do not know this.\n\nThe following two sections reiterate this point, deepening its emphasis. Things are not without their \"that\"; things are not without their \"this.\" From the perspective of \"that,\" one does not see; from the perspective of knowing, one knows. Thus it is said: \"That emerges from this, and this also arises from that.\" This is the doctrine of the mutual arising of \"that\" and \"this.\"\n\nThe previous section spoke only of right and wrong, yet right and wrong truly arise from the opposition of self and other. Thus, this section takes \"that\" and \"this\" as its subject. \"Things are not without their 'that'\" means all things possess self and other—what is \"that\" to me is \"that\" to another, and what is \"I\" to me is \"that\" to another. \"Things are not without their 'this'\" means all things possess right and wrong—what is right to another is \"this\" to me, and what is right to me is \"this\" to another.\n\n\"From the perspective of 'that,' one does not see\" means that from another’s viewpoint, one does not perceive their \"that.\" Why is this so? Because the other regards their \"that\" as \"I,\" and thus does not see it as \"that.\" If the other takes their wrong as right, they do not see what is truly right. \"From the perspective of the self, one knows\" means that from one’s own viewpoint, one perceives the other’s \"that.\" Seeing where the other is not right, one knows what is truly right. This shows that one must not be self-blinded, as others may not know themselves—yet from the self’s perspective, one knows.\n\n\"That emerges from this\" means that my designation of the other as \"that\" and the other’s designation of me as \"that\" both arise from self-affirmation. Thus, when I affirm myself, I ascribe wrong to the other and call them \"that.\" When the other affirms themselves, they ascribe wrong to me and call me \"that.\" \"This also arises from that\" means that my self-affirmation and the other’s self-affirmation both depend on the division between self and other. When I take the other as \"that,\" I necessarily ascribe wrong to them and regard myself as right. When the other takes me as \"that,\" they necessarily ascribe wrong to me and regard themselves as right. Thus, \"that\" and \"this\" arise endlessly.\n\nYet even as they arise, they perish; even as they perish, they arise. Even as they are affirmed, they are denied; even as they are denied, they are affirmed. Though the doctrine of \"that\" and \"this\" arises, it is appended with \"even as they arise,\" followed by a turn: \"though...\" For where there is arising, there is perishing; where there is perishing, there is arising. Where there is affirmation, there is denial; where there is denial, there is affirmation. Viewed through the principle of cyclical recurrence, the doctrine of \"that\" and \"this\" must have a time of cessation, and what now cannot be equalized must have a time when it can.\n\nThus, one follows right because of wrong, and follows wrong because of right. Therefore, the sage does not proceed by this path but illumines it by the heavens—this, too, is following right. For now, one follows their right and wrong, awaiting their natural resolution. It must be reiterated: one follows right because of wrong, and follows wrong because of right. Having followed right, one also follows wrong; having followed wrong, one also follows right. If one follows only one without the other, one remains mired in contention. Thus, the sage does not tread the path of right and wrong but transcends beyond things. Or, if there is right and wrong, one merely illumines it by the heavens—meaning, whether right or wrong, the heavens themselves oversee it. This is also a way of following right. Though it speaks of following right and wrong, it then speaks only of following right—this is an ellipsis. The following text further clarifies the doctrine of following right.\n\n\"This\" is also \"that,\" and \"that\" is also \"this.\" \"That\" has its own right and wrong, and \"this\" has its own right and wrong. Is there truly a \"that\" and \"this\"? Or is there truly no \"that\" and \"this\"? This is the sage’s way of following right. Whatever is \"this\" is also ascribed to \"that,\" and whatever is \"that\" is also taken as \"this.\" Thus, this entirely regards \"that\" as right and acknowledges its own wrong, while that entirely regards this as right and acknowledges its own wrong. Each has its own right and wrong—how, then, can they be divided into \"that\" and \"this\"?\n\nWhen \"that\" and \"this\" find no counterpart, this is called the pivot of the Dao. The pivot attains the center of the ring, responding to the infinite. \"This\" is one infinity, and \"not-this\" is another infinity. When \"that\" and \"this\" do not oppose each other, there is no right and wrong—this is called the pivot of the Dao. Another explanation of the pivot: the pivot is the door’s bolt. Placed at the center of the ring, it cannot be fixed yet opens and closes endlessly. The sage holds the pivot of the Dao and simply listens to the endless right and wrong—this, too, is following right. Thus it is said: \"nothing is better than illumination,\" echoing the earlier conclusion.\n\nTo use a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is not as good as using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. To use a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse. Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.\n\nWhat can be affirmed is affirmed; what cannot be affirmed is not affirmed. The Dao is enacted and becomes; things are named and thus are. How is it so? It is so because it is so. How is it not so? It is not so because it is not so. Things inherently have what they affirm; things inherently have what they accept. There is nothing that is not so; there is nothing that cannot be accepted.\n\nThis follows from the earlier passage on \"what can be affirmed and what cannot be affirmed.\" During the Warring States period, there was a debate over whether a white horse is not a horse—hence the reference. It then turns to the finger on one’s own body to discuss both together.",

      "translated_text": "This is the finger, yet debaters must insist: using what is not a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is superior to using the class of fingers to illustrate that it is not a finger. This is the horse, yet debaters must insist: using what is not a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is superior to using the class of horses to illustrate that it is not a horse.\n\nIf heaven and earth are combined into one finger, then what people call a \"finger\" is no longer a finger. If the myriad things are summed into one horse, then what people call a \"horse\" is no longer a horse. From a perspective of attachment, one must regard a finger as a finger and a horse as a horse. From a perspective free of attachment, heaven and earth may be called a finger, and the myriad things may be called a horse. Thus, one must not cling to assertions of right and wrong. One should simply affirm what can be affirmed and reject what cannot be affirmed.\n\nThe Dao originally has no name; people enact it and thus establish the name of the Dao. Things originally have no name; people designate them and thus establish the names of things. Therefore, what is \"so\" and what is \"not so\" are merely human impositions. To affirm what is affirmed and deny what is denied is acceptable. Though things inherently possess their own principles—what is \"so\" and what is \"acceptable\" are also viewed as such—then nothing is not so, and nothing is unacceptable.\n\nHere, *duan di* (端的) means \"principle\" or \"definite basis.\" Thus, consider the examples of the rafter and the pillar, the ugly *Li* and the beautiful *Xishi*, the vast and the strange—all are united through the Dao. The rafter (*ting*) is the beam of a house; the pillar (*ying*) stands on the east and west sides of the hall. *Li* is an ugly person; *Xishi* is a beautiful one. The rafter lies horizontally while the pillar stands vertically; *Li* is hideous while *Xishi* is lovely. Though their forms are strange and varied, all are united through the Dao.\n\nTheir division is their completion; their completion is their destruction. All things are neither completed nor destroyed, for they return to unity. Their division is their fragmentation. What some regard as completion may be destruction for others. Thus, all things are neither completed nor destroyed; when reversed and united, they are but one. If one observes only from the perspective of completion, one does not see destruction. If one observes only from the perspective of destruction, one does not see completion. Observing the cycle of completion and destruction, one sees that completion may become destruction, and destruction may become completion—yet in reality, they are one.\n\nOnly the enlightened know that all is united, and thus they do not force their views but lodge them in the ordinary. The ordinary (*yong*) is use; use is unity; unity is attainment. Attaining this is near the subtlety of the Dao. Proceeding thus, acting without knowing why it is so—this is called the Dao.\n\nThe enlightened know that all is united, so they do not impose their views but lodge them in practical affairs. Lodging in practical affairs is use; use is unity. Unity is attainment in the heart. Having attained this, one approaches the Dao. This is what is meant by \"proceeding thus.\" Acting habitually without knowing why—this is called the Dao.\n\nTo exhaust one’s spirit in forcing unity without recognizing their sameness is called \"morning three.\" What is \"morning three\"? It is said: The monkey keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, \"Three in the morning and four in the evening.\" All the monkeys were angry. He then said, \"Very well, four in the morning and three in the evening.\" All the monkeys were pleased. The substance remained unchanged, yet joy and anger were employed—this, too, proceeds from the same principle.\n\nThus, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the evenness of heaven—this is called \"walking two paths.\" Those who labor their minds with one-sided views do not understand unity. Like the monkeys, who were unaware of their own reactions, the keeper accommodated their desires without altering the substance—this, too, follows the principle of \"proceeding thus.\" Therefore, the sage affirms what is affirmed and denies what is denied, harmonizing them so there is no contention and all rests in the balance of heaven’s principle. This is called \"walking two paths without contradiction.\"\n\nThe knowledge of the ancients reached its utmost. To what extent? To the point of believing there had never been any things—this is the utmost, the ultimate, beyond which nothing can be added. Next were those who believed things existed but had never been bounded. Next were those who believed boundaries existed but had never been right and wrong. The manifestation of right and wrong is the diminishment of the Dao. The diminishment of the Dao is the formation of attachment.\n\nFollowing the preceding discussion of the sage, we now speak of the ancients. Those who believed there had never been any things were like the *wuji* (the Ultimate of Non-being). To know this is to reach the utmost, the ultimate, beyond which nothing can be added. The *Doctrine of the Mean* also says: \"The workings of Heaven are without sound or scent—this is the utmost.\" If there had never been any things, how could there be right and wrong? Harmonizing right and wrong is the work of later sages; the ancients had no such distinctions. Is there truly completion and diminishment? Is there truly neither completion nor diminishment?",

      "translated_text": "Here begins the *Inner Chapters: On the Equality of Things (Part Two)*, collated by Lu Lingzhu’s disciple Peng Xiang of Bamboo Peak in Luling.\n\nSuppose I now speak of something—how could one know whether it belongs to the same category as this or not? Whether it belongs or does not belong, if both are taken as belonging, then it differs in no way from that. This passage follows from the earlier discussion of \"those who have speech.\"\n\nNow, if we take human speech—whether it resembles this or does not resemble this—all are alike in being speech. If this is deemed right, then that too is deemed right; if this is deemed wrong, then that too is deemed wrong. They are fundamentally alike. Or if this is deemed right while that is deemed wrong, they are still alike in their shared wrongness; if this is deemed wrong while that is deemed right, they are alike in their shared rightness. All are of one category, differing not from the other’s claims and thus beyond contention.\n\nYet let me attempt to speak of it: There is a beginning; there is that which precedes the beginning; there is that which precedes even that which precedes the beginning. There is being; there is non-being; there is that which precedes non-being; there is that which precedes even that which precedes non-being. Suddenly there is being and non-being, yet one cannot know which of the two truly is or is not. Now I have something to say, yet I do not know whether what I call it truly has meaning or truly has no meaning.\n\nLet me attempt to speak of it, let me try to speak of it. What was spoken before was human speech; what I now say is my own speech. Yet, taking another turn, if we examine the origins of Heaven and Earth and the myriad things, there was neither being nor non-being, nor even the absence of non-being. The discourse of being and non-being arose only in later ages. Thus, human speech is not to be relied upon, nor is my own speech truly meaningful.\n\nIn all the world, nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; nothing lives longer than a child who dies young, yet Peng Zu is short-lived. Heaven and Earth are born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one. Since we are already one, how could there be speech? Since we have already called it one, how could there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. Proceeding thus, even the most skilled mathematician cannot arrive at a sum—how much less the ordinary person? Therefore, from non-being to being, reaching three, how much more so from being to being? There is no need to proceed further; let it rest here.\n\nThe tip of an autumn hair is inherently small, yet if we say the tip of an autumn hair cannot be further divided, it may be called great. Beyond Mount Tai, there are still greater things, so it may be called small. A child who dies young is inherently short-lived, yet if we name it as such, it has lived its years, so it may be called long-lived. Beyond Peng Zu, there are still longer-lived beings, so he may be called short-lived. But when viewed through Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, there are no distinctions. Human life begins with a body that already contains a Heaven and Earth. Thus, Heaven and Earth are born together with me. There is nothing among the myriad things that is not so—thus, the myriad things and I are one body. What distinction is there between small and great, long-lived and short-lived?\n\nSince we are one, there is no room for speech. If one insists on speaking of \"one,\" then speech proliferates, and right and wrong become endless. Therefore, one should return to the origin of emptiness and non-being, resting in what is so—this responds to the earlier \"let it rest here.\"\n\nThe Dao has never had boundaries; speech has never had constancy. Yet for the sake of this, distinctions arise. Here, the Dao and speech are set in contrast to boundaries, further refining the notion of limits.\n\nLet me speak of these boundaries: there is left and right, there are ranks and principles, there are divisions and debates, there are competitions and contentions. These are called the eight virtues. *Ranks* refer to order; *principles* refer to appropriateness. Having established order, one must also ensure that each matter is fitting. *Divisions* refer to distinctions; *debates* refine them further. *Competition* pertains to the mind, while *contention* pertains to force. As the *Zuo Tradition* says: \"Not competing in mind but contending in force.\"\n\nBeyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss; within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not deliberate; regarding the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the intentions of the former kings, the sage deliberates but does not debate. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records the intentions of the former kings—it is a historical text. In the *Rites of Zhou*, the lesser scribe is charged with the records of the state. Thus, Heaven and Earth, past and present, are all that the sage does not speak of. *Deliberation* is more detailed than *discussion*; *debate* is more detailed than *deliberation*.\n\nTherefore, where there are divisions, there are also non-divisions; where there are debates, there are also non-debates. One asks: Why? The sage embraces them.",

      "translated_text": "The scroll is to be stored away. The multitude debate it to display to one another. Thus it is said: in debate, there are things unseen. One seeks to see them yet paradoxically does not.\n\nThe great Dao is not named; great disputation does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest—*qiàn* (慊) here means \"to be sated with things,\" implying the heart’s attachment to them. Some are sated with satisfaction and sufficiency, others with resentment and lack. This speaks of how great integrity does not take integrity as self-sufficiency. Great courage does not harm.\n\nWhen the Dao is made manifest, it ceases to be the Dao; when words are debated, they fall short; when benevolence is constant, it fails to achieve completion; when one relies on courage to harm others, it is no longer the true Dao. To display it is to render it insufficient as the Dao. To debate it is to leave gaps unaddressed. Confined by habitual attachments, benevolence becomes limited and fails to fulfill its nature. Integrity, though pure, is not trusted—self-proclaimed purity cannot win others’ faith. Courage, when used to harm, does not achieve greatness.\n\nThese five, when rounded, nearly approach the square. *Rounded* (圆) means circular, adaptable. The great Dao is not named, and great courage does not seek gratification. These five principles are fundamentally fluid and natural; when the Dao is made manifest, it ceases to be the Dao, and when courage harms, it fails to achieve greatness. Yet if these five are rigidly adhered to, they nearly become square.\n\nThus, to know where to stop in what one does not know is perfection. Who knows the disputation of the unspeaking, the Dao of the unspoken? If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Treasury. It may be drawn from without ever being exhausted, poured from without ever being depleted, yet one knows not whence it comes—this is called *preserving illumination*. *Preserving* (葆) means to nurture. Before understanding this principle, one says: \"Nothing compares to clarity.\" Once this principle is grasped, one nurtures its radiance.\n\nThis passage is divided into five sections: the first concludes with *obscurity* (芒), the second, third, and fourth with *clarity* (以明), and the fifth with *preserving illumination* (葆光). *Obscurity* is the reverse of clarity, yet both are forms of brilliance. The general meaning is that externally, one follows what is so, while internally, one naturally illuminates the truth. Thus, the phrase \"follow what is so\" appears five times, while \"clarity\" appears three.\n\nTherefore, in ancient times, Yao asked Shun: \"I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when I face south, I feel unsettled. What is the reason?\" Shun replied: \"Those three rulers still dwell among the brambles and reeds. Why do you feel unsettled? In the past, when ten suns appeared together, all things were illuminated—how much more so for virtue that surpasses the sun?\" Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao were three states. Zong was one, Kuai two, and Xu’ao three. The \"three rulers\" were the lords of these states. *Still* (犹) means \"yet\"; *dwell* (存) means \"to be present\"; *you* (若) means \"you.\" These three rulers, secluded in remote places, had not yet witnessed the transformative power of virtue, like being concealed among overgrown weeds. What cause is there for resentment? One should instead return to one’s own virtue. Even the sun has places it cannot illuminate; when ten suns shine together, nothing is left unlit. How much more so for virtue’s illumination, which far exceeds the sun’s? Though these three states are remote, they will eventually cut through the brambles and thorns to come and submit—why attack them?\n\nNie Que asked Wang Ni: According to the *Biographies of Lofty Scholars*, Wang Ni was a worthy man of Yao’s time. The *Heaven and Earth* chapter states he was Nie Que’s teacher. \"Do you know what all things agree upon as right?\" He replied:",
      "overlap_context": "nnals* records the intentions of the former kings—it is a historical text. In the *Rites of Zhou*, the lesser scribe is charged with the records of the state. Thus, Heaven and Earth, past and present, are all that the sage does not speak of. *Deliberation* is more detailed than *discussion*; *debate* is more detailed than *deliberation*.\n\nTherefore, where there are divisions, there are also non-divisions; where there are debates, there are also non-debates. One asks: Why? The sage embraces them.",

      "translated_text": "The Lady of Li was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. Though not from the Li Rong tribe, she was still subject to the custom where men were esteemed and women held cheap. When the state of Jin first acquired her, she wept until her tears soaked her collar. Yet once she arrived at the royal court, sharing the king’s bed and feasting on fine meats, she came to regret her tears.\n\nHow do I know that the dead do not regret their former toil for life? One who dreams of drinking wine may wake weeping; one who dreams of weeping may wake to go hunting. In the midst of a dream, one does not know it is a dream. Within the dream, one may even interpret the dream—only upon waking does one realize it was a dream. And only with great awakening does one know that all this was a great dream. Yet fools believe themselves awake, priding themselves on their knowledge: \"Are you a lord? A herdsman?\"—thus dividing noble and base. How rigid! How shallow!\n\nI and you are both dreaming—what I call your dream is also a dream. Even this discourse is a dream. Such words are called *diaogui*—utterly strange. Should a great sage arise in ten thousand generations to unravel this, it would be as if encountering him at dawn or dusk. To speak of ten thousand generations as dawn and dusk is to say such a one is rare—perhaps never to appear. Yet if he were to arise after ten thousand generations, it would still be as near as dawn or dusk.\n\nIf you and I were to debate, and you prevailed over me, or I over you—would you truly be right and I wrong? Or I right and you wrong? Or might we both be right, or both wrong? You and I cannot know. Others are likewise shrouded in darkness. How could we entrust judgment to another? If we sought one who agrees with you to decide, how could they judge fairly, being of your mind? If we sought one who agrees with me, how could they judge fairly, being of my mind? If we sought one who differs from both of us, how could they judge fairly, being unlike us? If we sought one who agrees with both of us, how could they judge fairly, being like us? Thus, neither you, nor I, nor others can know—must we await that sage of ten thousand generations?\n\nWhat does it mean to harmonize with the *tianni*?\n\nQuquezi posed the question, for this too is a common expression among Daoists.\n\nLongwuzi replied: \"Is\" is not \"is,\" \"not\" is not \"not.\" If \"is\" were truly \"is,\" then its difference from \"not-is\" would require no debate. If \"so\" were truly \"so,\" then its difference from \"not-so\" would require no debate. In all matters, one should affirm what others deny; in all words, one should assent to what others reject. If what I affirm is truly affirmed, then this matter is settled—other matters, though denied, need not be contested for their difference. If what I assent to is truly assented to, then this word is settled—other words, though rejected, need not be contested for their difference.\n\nTransforming voices depend on one another, yet seem not to depend. *Huasheng*—like the \"influence of culture\" in books, or the \"voice of benevolence\" Mencius spoke of—refers to those who await instruction to be transformed. How much finer to be transformed without awaiting instruction! To be free of debate is already excellent; to be free even of voice is yet a higher level.\n\nTo harmonize with the *tianni*: *Tian* means \"natural,\" *ni* means \"incipience.\" The moment a beginning emerges, it arises from the naturalness of *tian*, without awaiting its full manifestation—this is called harmonizing with the *tianni*.

Yet how could he know whether Zhou had dreamed he was a butterfly, or the butterfly now dreamed it was Zhou? Waking is but another dream, and thus it seemed the butterfly’s dream had become Zhou. Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. Yet if Zhou and the butterfly cannot know their own division, how could one discern the boundary between this and that, self and other? This is called the transformation of things.\n\nThis is the principle of the myriad things’ transformation: when one contemplates the metamorphosis of things, one sees that they need not be equal. This chapter is titled \"Equalizing Things,\" and thus concludes by returning to the word *thing*.\n\nThe second chapter of the *Nanhua* is widely deemed difficult to read. Here it is divided into three major sections: from Nan Guo Ziqi sitting with his back to the desk to *\"this is how they come into being\"* forms the first section, which itself contains three subsections—first, the dialogue between the master and disciple in their confusion; next, the earthly pipes; and finally, the heavenly pipes. From *\"without that, there is no self\"* to *\"this is called preserving one’s inner light\"* forms the second section, which contains five subsections—first, following Ziqi’s discourse on the heavenly pipes, it speaks of man’s inherent true master yet his ignorance of it; the subsequent subsections largely excerpt Gongsun Long’s paradoxes: the second on affirmation and negation, the third on right and wrong, the fourth on self and other, and the fifth on *\"not the finger\"* and *\"not the horse.\"* The conclusion is that nothing surpasses silence. From *\"Yao questioned Shun\"* to the end forms the third section, serving only to cite evidence in support of the preceding section’s meaning, arranged as in the previous chapter. It contains four subsections: the first speaks of virtue advancing beyond the sun to clarify the earlier exposition; the second speaks of the perfected person transcending life and death, and thus beyond right and wrong; the third speaks of the Dao as needing no cultivation, and thus beyond right and wrong; the fourth and fifth offer two analogies, showing that even within the human body there are things one cannot know—how then could one know right and wrong? Thus, one can only listen to the inequality of things and equalize them.\n\nHere ends the third scroll of the *Xunben* edition of the *True Classic of Nanhua*.\nHere begins the fourth scroll of the *Xunben* edition of the *True Classic of Nanhua*.",

      "translated_text": "Lululing Bamboo Peak’s Luo Miandao, as recorded by his disciple Peng Xiang, collated and punctuated\n\n**Inner Chapters: The Pivot of Nurturing Life**\nThis chapter speaks of the pivot of nurturing life. It first states that nurturing life must accord with its natural course; later, it states that though one speaks of nurturing life, one should in truth regard death and life as one.\n\nOur life is bounded, yet knowledge is boundless. To pursue the boundless with the bounded is perilous; and to do so in the name of knowledge is perilous indeed.\n\nIn doing good, do not seek fame; in doing evil, do not court punishment. Follow the central path as your constant guide—thus can you preserve the body, fulfill life, nurture kin, and live out your years.\n\n*Near* means to draw close. *Follow* means to accord. *Supervisor* refers to the center, as the seam down the back of a garment is called the *du*; this is the sense intended here. Those who do good inevitably gain renown; those who do evil inevitably incur punishment. To nurture life well is to relinquish knowledge and forget both good and evil. Thus, in doing good, one does not draw near to fame’s allure; in doing evil, one does not draw near to punishment’s harm. For without the pursuit of good or evil, one naturally transcends the confines of punishment and reputation.\n\nYet do not cling to the center as a rigid rule. The *center* of which Laozi speaks—embracing the One and guarding the center—does not mean straddling the middle between good and evil. Zhu Xi, in his postscript to the *Supreme Polarity Discourse*, criticizes this interpretation, though it may not reflect the original intent.\n\nCook Ding, carving an ox for Lord Wenhui of Liang (King Hui of Liang), offers an analogy for nurturing life. Where his hand touches, where his shoulder leans—his strength applied, his shoulder tilts. Where his foot treads, where his knee presses (the sound *ji*, as the knee braces)—*huo!* (a crisp sound), the blade enters with a *xiang* (resonant rush), and the knife slices with a *huo* (sharp crack).",

      "translated_text": "The *xu* sound—still a faint resonance, yet audible. The *huo* sound, however, is loud and clear. As the blade moves in rhythm, it is as though playing music, every stroke attuned to harmony. It matches the dance of *Sanglin*, and aligns with the cadence of *Lishou*. The *Zuozhuan* annotates: *Sanglin* was the music of the Shang sovereigns. The *Record of Rites* states: feudal lords used *Lishou* as their rhythmic measure. It further notes: *Lishou xu*—the moment when music converges. And again: feudal lords timed their audiences with the Son of Heaven to this measure. These two musical pieces are invoked because Tang prayed at *Sanglin*, offering himself as sacrifice, while the feudal lords sang *Lishou* in archery rites to rebuke those who failed to attend court. Both hold meaning for the art of ox-carving.\n\nLord Wenhui exclaimed, *\"Xi!\"*—a sigh of admiration—\"How sublime! Has skill ever reached such heights?\" Cook Ding laid down his blade and replied: \"Your servant pursues the *Dao*, advancing beyond mere technique. When I first began carving oxen, all I saw was the whole beast. After three years, I no longer saw the ox entire. Now, I encounter it with spirit rather than sight; my senses halt while my spirit moves. The eye’s office governs vision. I follow the natural pattern—*tian* as spontaneity, *li* as the inherent grain. The ox’s body possesses a natural structure; I cleave along its lines. I strike the great gaps (*pi* the wide fissures), guide the blade through the spacious hollows (*kuan*), and proceed as its fixed nature dictates. I have never touched the sinew-bound joints (*jing qing*), let alone the great bones (*gu*). A skilled cook replaces his knife yearly—he only cuts flesh. An ordinary cook changes his blade monthly—he hacks bone and dulls the edge. My knife has endured nineteen years—nineteen, a number accumulating to unity—and has carved thousands of oxen, yet its edge remains as if newly whetted from the grindstone. The blade’s edge is razor-thin, while the joints have space. To enter the space with what has no thickness—how vast the room for the blade’s play! Thus, after nineteen years, my knife is still as if newly sharpened. Yet whenever I encounter a dense cluster of bones, I perceive the difficulty, grow wary, fix my gaze, slow my movements, and move the blade with utmost care. Then—*huo!*—the ox falls apart like clods of earth. I stand holding the knife, look around in satisfaction, linger with self-assurance, then wipe the blade clean and put it away.\"\n\nLord Wenhui said, \"Excellent! From Cook Ding’s words, I have learned the art of nurturing life.\" Here, the discourse takes another turn: though my knife-work is indeed refined, whenever I reach a dense cluster, I recognize the challenge and dare not grow complacent. My former reliance on spirit rather than sight now sharpens into focused attention; my once-fluid motion slows to deliberate care; my blade’s effortless play becomes a movement of utmost precision. Only when the ox dissolves—*huo!*—like earth crumbling to the ground do I stand holding the knife, survey the scene with an unoccupied gaze, pause in quiet triumph, then tend to the blade and store it away.

      "translated_text": "Gongwen Xuan was a native of Song. Upon seeing the Right Minister—a position held in the Song court alongside the Left Minister—he exclaimed in astonishment, \"What manner of man is this? How came he to be one-legged? Is this a natural deformity, or the result of punishment?\" For to be one-legged was to be maimed, as in the case of Sun Bin. \"Was this fate’s decree, or man’s doing?\" he wondered. Then he answered himself: \"It was Heaven, not man. Heaven’s creation made him thus solitary; man’s form is meant to be paired. From this we know it was Heaven’s work, not man’s.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Man is born with two feet; that he now has but one is Heaven’s doing. To suffer such a fate is simply the course of destiny—nothing more than Heaven’s will.\"\n\nA marsh pheasant takes ten steps to peck, a hundred steps to drink, yet it does not seek to be kept in a cage. Though its spirit may thrive, it finds no goodness in confinement. The pheasant in the marsh drinks and pecks at ease, never desiring the nourishment of a cage. Yet if caged, though its vitality may be preserved, it remains constrained—this is not true well-being. What matter if one is one-legged? But to serve as Right Minister, bound by office, is to court disaster. This is to lose the Way of nurturing life.\n\nWhen Lao Dan died, Qin Shi went to offer condolences. He wailed three times and departed. A disciple asked, \"Was he not your master’s friend?\" \"He was,\" Qin Shi replied. The disciple pressed, \"Then is such brief mourning proper?\" Qin Shi answered, \"At first, I thought him a true man, but now I see he was not.\" He referred to Lao Dan. \"At first, I took him for one of Lao Dan’s disciples, but now I see he was not—he was still entangled in worldly sentiment.\"\n\n\"When I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping as if for a son, and youths wailing as if for a mother. In their gathering, there must have been those who spoke without seeking to speak, who wept without seeking to weep. This is to flee from Heaven and betray one’s true nature, to forget what one has received—what the ancients called ‘the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.’ To gather and be moved thus is to flee from the principles of Heaven, to violate one’s true feelings, and to forget the destiny one is born with. In the ancient age of emptiness and tranquility, such behavior would be deemed a transgression against Heaven, a fault in the rites of mourning.\"\n\n\"When he came, the Master followed the time; when he departed, the Master followed the flow. To dwell in accord with the time and abide in the natural course is to remain untouched by joy or sorrow—what the ancients called ‘the celestial release.’ Life arrives as the time comes; death departs as the time flows. To accept the time is to find no excess in life’s joy; to follow the flow is to find no lack in death’s sorrow. The ‘celestial release’ refers to Heaven’s workings through yin and yang, the Five Phases, giving rise to all things. Man receives these at birth, bound by joy and anger, sorrow and happiness, fortune and misfortune, regret and blame—all that entangles him. Yet if one dwells in accord with the time and abides in the natural course, sorrow and joy cannot enter, and the bonds of Heaven are loosed.\"\n\n\"The men of old were thus, which is why Qin Shi wailed but three times before departing. A finger may trace the length of firewood, but the firewood is boundless while the finger is finite. Yet when the fire is passed from one to the next, its end is unknown. This is another parable to illustrate the principle of life and death. No man is immortal—why then grieve excessively?\"\n\nThe preceding sections spoke of nurturing life; this one speaks of viewing life and death as one.

Both are but children—how could one surpass the other and seek alone that others follow one’s own words? Would this not mean that one has surpassed even the Son of Heaven? If one can grasp this principle and not seek to prevail through one’s own judgments, then one remains whole. This is the intent of Heaven in treating all as its children.

      "translated_text": "Yan Hui said: \"Hui’s family is poor. For months now, I have neither drunk wine nor eaten meat. If this is so, may I consider it fasting?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"This is the fast of sacrificial rites, not the fast of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui said: \"May I ask about the fast of the mind?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind but listen with qi. Listening stops at the ears, the mind stops at the tally. Qi is that which is empty and awaits things. The tally is what is called one’s nature. As Yang Xiong said in *Da Bin Xi*: 'Be cautious in cultivating your will, guard and observe the celestial tally.' This speaks of nature and the celestial tally, hence it is called the tally. Like a tally or contract, hearing sound stops at the ears, thought stops at the tally. Only qi has no thought—it is merely empty and awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fast of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui said: \"Before I had begun to be employed, I was truly myself. Once employed, I would no longer be myself. If I do not know the Dao, then my hundred limbs would have no one to obey. Truly, this is one—once Yan Hui attains the Dao, there is only emptiness. How could this body remain? Can this be called emptiness?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"You have exhausted it. I will tell you! If you can enter and wander within its enclosure without being moved by its name—entering, then speak; not entering, then stop. Without gate, without harm, dwelling in one abode and lodging in inevitability—then you are near. Take birds as an analogy: the state of Wei is like a cage for its ruler, the dragon. Yan Hui wishes to go to Wei, as if entering a cage. But if you enter and wander within the state without being moved by its illustrious name, this is called 'entering and wandering.' Though you enter, you retain the meaning of roaming freely, not constrained by circumstance. If you gain entry, then admonish; if you do not, then stop—there is no need to insist on entry. Yet if you do enter, consider the way of dwelling: Wei is not a place where one should reside. Without a single gate that is not harmful, you may only secure one dwelling and lodge this body in inevitability. To lodge is to reside without attachment. If you do this, you will be near to the Lord of Wei. 'Near' means close. This is to instruct Yan Hui on how to enter, dwell, and wait—remaining long enough to transform naturally. What follows is the way to effect that transformation.\n\nTo erase traces is easy; to walk without treading is difficult. It is easy for one to erase their tracks, but how can one not tread at all? To be employed by man is easy to feign; to be employed by Heaven is difficult to feign. Though human affairs contain the principles of Heaven, man may be deceived, but Heaven cannot. These four lines speak of Yan Hui’s need to efface his form and traces, and discard superficial falsity.\n\nI have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings. This analogy applies to the following line: I have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing with non-knowledge. Knowing without knowledge is great knowledge—yet I have never heard of such a person. These four lines speak of Yan Hui’s need to cast aside cunning intelligence.\n\nGaze upon that empty chamber: in an empty room, brightness is born, and auspiciousness comes to rest. This teaches Yan Hui the principle of an empty mind. Gazing upon the space within a gate and chamber is like the heart within a person. When an empty room is unobstructed, brightness naturally arises, and a hundred auspicious signs gather. When the mind is empty and unobstructed, it naturally becomes luminous, and ten thousand virtues congeal and rest. 'Comes to rest' means to rest and rest again. In the *Book of Changes*, yin and yang flow through the nine stars, and the central palace’s unobstructed brightness is considered auspicious—this also takes emptiness and lack of obstruction as its meaning. If one does not come to rest, this is called 'sitting in motion.' When the mind is unrestrained and knows no limit, the body may be still, but the mind is not—hence it is called 'sitting in motion.'\n\nIf you follow the ears and eyes, communicating inwardly but outwardly abandoning the mind’s knowledge, then ghosts and spirits will come to dwell—how much more so men! The ears and eyes are external, yet if you follow them inwardly, and the mind’s knowledge is internal, yet if you cast it outwardly—there is only emptiness. If this is so, then ghosts and spirits will come to dwell with you—how much more so men! The word 'dwell' responds to the earlier 'abode.'\n\nThis is the transformation of the ten thousand things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the lifelong practice of the ancient emperors Fu Xi and Qi. How much more so for one who is merely scattered and common! The principle of an empty mind is the means by which the ten thousand things are moved to transformation. It is the pivot by which Yu and Shun governed. It is what Fu Xi and Qi practiced throughout their lives. How much more so for the Lord of Wei, who is but a scattered and common man—how could he be difficult to transform?\"\n\nThe concluding passage about scattering horses is not part of the main text.\n\nWhen Gongzi Gao was about to be sent on a mission to Qi, he asked Confucius: \"The king has entrusted a weighty task to Zhuliang. Qi’s treatment of envoys is likely to be respectful but not urgent. Even a single state is not yet ready to be moved—how much less the feudal lords! I am deeply apprehensive.\"\n\nYou once told Zhuliang: \"In all matters, whether great or small, few are not brought to completion through joyful harmony. If a matter is not completed, there will surely be human calamities—punishment and blame. If it is completed, there will surely be the calamities of yin and yang—worry and illness from imbalance. Only one who possesses virtue can achieve success or failure without calamity.\"\n\n\"I eat coarse food and do not seek refinement. My kitchen stove is without desire for coolness. Now, upon receiving my mission in the morning, I drink ice in the evening—is this not internal heat? Coarse food is rough fare. 'Not seeking refinement' means not insisting on fine quality. 'Desire for coolness' refers to one who suffers from heat and seeks coolness. I eat only coarse, rough food and do not insist on refinement. My kitchen stove is simple, and the cook need not suffer from heat and long for coolness. Yet now, upon receiving my mission to Qi in the morning, I drink ice in the evening—this is the excess of worry and thought leading to internal heat, not the fault of food and drink.\"",

      "translated_text": "\"Before I have even reached the true nature of affairs—indeed, before I have grasped their essence—I have already incurred the harm of yin-yang imbalance. If the matter fails, there will inevitably be human-caused calamity; these are two dangers. As a minister, I am not equal to this task. Pray, tell me what to do.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"There are two great precepts in the world. The first is fate; the second is duty. Your love for your parents is fate—it cannot be untied from the heart. This is the principle of Heaven’s mandate, the natural arising of benevolence and love, which never parts from this heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is nowhere that is not the lord’s domain. 'Under heaven, none is not the king’s land; within the seas, none is not the king’s subject.' There is no escape within heaven and earth. These are called the great precepts.\n\nThus, in serving one’s parents, one finds contentment without choosing the place—this is the utmost of filial piety. In serving one’s lord, one finds contentment without choosing the task—this is the height of loyalty. In attending to one’s own heart, one remains unwavering in joy, unshaken by changing circumstances, accepting what cannot be helped as if it were fate—this is the perfection of virtue. As a minister and son, one must have something that cannot be obstructed. Focus on the true nature of affairs and forget the self—how then could one have leisure to delight in life and fear death? You may proceed in this way.\n\nLet me further share what I have heard: In close dealings, trust is naturally established without need for words. In distant dealings, loyalty must be expressed through words, and words must sometimes be conveyed by others. Conveying words that bring joy or anger to both parties is the most difficult task in the world. When both sides are pleased, their words will overflow with excessive praise; when both are angry, their words will overflow with excessive blame. If two states are both pleased, their words will inevitably contain exaggerated commendation; if both are angry, their words will inevitably contain exaggerated slander. This is why conveying such words is so difficult. All exaggeration is falsehood; falsehood cannot be trusted, and when trust is lacking, the messenger incurs misfortune.\n\nThus, the *Model Sayings* states: 'Transmit the constant truth of affairs; do not transmit exaggerated words, and you will be nearly blameless.' Moreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin with openness but often end in secrecy; when excess prevails, cunning abounds. Those who drink wine with propriety begin in order but often end in chaos; when excess prevails, strange amusements multiply. All things are like this. They begin with sincerity and trust but often end in vulgarity and coarseness. Their inception is simple, but their conclusion is inevitably grand.\n\nWords are like wind and waves; actions are like gain and loss. Wind and waves are easily stirred; gain and loss are easily endangered. Words, being insubstantial like waves following the wind, are easily set in motion. Actions, being real, constantly risk loss—hence, they are easily imperiled. Thus, anger arises without cause, and clever words become biased. When a beast is dying, it does not choose its sounds; its breath is ragged, and in this state, a vicious heart arises. If one encounters someone who vents their anger without regard for reason, one can only respond with clever, biased words—like a dying beast that cannot choose the quality of its sounds, only aware of its ragged breath. In this way, the harm of yin-yang imbalance arises, and a mental affliction takes root.\n\nWhen severity and exactitude reach their extreme, there will inevitably be an unworthy response, though one may not realize it. If one does not know how this comes to be, who can foresee the outcome? Thus, the *Model Sayings* states: 'Do not alter commands; do not urge completion—excess leads to harm.' Altering commands and urging completion endanger affairs. These two lines summarize the two *Model Sayings*: transmitting exaggerated words is excessive, and altering commands or urging completion is adding to or changing them, which leads to peril.\n\nWhat is beautifully accomplished takes time; what is badly accomplished cannot be undone. The perfection of beauty is difficult and requires long effort to achieve. The completion of evil is swift and leaves no time for correction. Can one not be cautious?\n\nMoreover, riding things to roam the mind and entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection. Why contrive a response? It is best to deliver the message—this is the difficult part. Why fabricate clever deceit to report to the Lord of Qi? Simply convey the Lord of Chu’s command. Yet I fear Lord Ye will deem this impractical, so I conclude by saying: this is the difficult part—referring to the earlier statement that this is the most difficult task in the world.\"\n\nYan He, a recluse of Lu, was about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei. He asked Qu Boyu: \"There is a man here whose nature is as if Heaven itself were destructive. If I deal with him without restraint, I endanger the state; if I deal with him with restraint, I endanger myself. His knowledge is just enough to recognize others’ faults but not to understand why they err. In such a case, what should I do?\"\n\nQu Boyu said: \"Excellent question! Be on guard, be careful, and rectify yourself! In form, do not be distant; in heart, do not be discordant. However, these two approaches have their pitfalls. In form, do not be too intimate; in heart, do not be too expressive. If your form is close but not intrusive, you will not be estranged, yet you must not indulge his preferences and follow him deceptively. If your heart is harmonious but not outwardly manifest, you will not be contrary, yet you must not display it externally and boast.\n\nIf your form is too intimate, you risk collapse, ruin, downfall, and stumbling. If your heart is too expressive, you risk becoming a reputation, a name, an omen, or a calamity. If he behaves like a child, then act like a child with him. If he is without boundaries, then be without boundaries with him. If he is without limits, then be without limits with him.\"",

Yet if a mosquito or horsefly alights upon the horse and the groom fails to brush it away at once, the horse will snap its bit, shatter its bridle, and trample its chest. Love may reach a point where it brings loss—can one not be cautious?\n\nThe tiger and horse are natures meant to illustrate the case of the Crown Prince Wei.\n\nCarpenter Shi traveled to Qi and, arriving at Quyuan, saw an oak that served as the village shrine. Its girth could shade an ox, its trunk measured a hundred spans around (a span here being the width of a hand), its height rivaled the mountains, and only after rising seventy feet did it put forth branches. A dozen or more of its side limbs could have been made into boats. Spectators thronged like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter did not so much as glance at it but walked on without pause. His disciple, having feasted his eyes, caught up with Carpenter Shi and said, “Since I first took up the axe to follow you, Master, I have never seen timber so magnificent. Why did you not even look at it but walk on without stopping?”\n\n“Enough,” said the carpenter. “Say no more. It is a useless tree. Make a boat from it, and it will sink; make a coffin, and it will rot at once; make a vessel, and it will break at once; make a door, and it will ooze sap like a *men* tree; make a pillar, and it will be eaten by worms. It is a tree of no use—hence its longevity.”\n\nWhen Carpenter Shi returned home, the shrine oak appeared to him in a dream and said, “With what would you compare me? Would you compare me to the so-called ‘fine timber’? Think of the hawthorn, pear, orange, and pomelo—all the fruit-bearing trees. When their fruit ripens, they are stripped; when it is plucked, they are abused. Their great branches are broken, their small branches are torn. This is how their abilities bring suffering to their lives. They do not live out their natural span but die halfway, struck down by the world’s blows. All things are like this. As for me, I have sought to be of no use for a long time. Nearly did I die—now at last I have found it: this is my great use. Had I been of use, would I have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—how can one thing judge another? And you, a nearly dead man of no consequence—what do you know of a useless tree?”\n\nCarpenter Shi awoke and interpreted his dream. His disciple said, “If it sought to be of no use, why does it serve as a shrine?”\n\n“Hush!” said the carpenter. “Say nothing. It merely lodges there, enduring the scorn of those who do not understand it. Were it not a shrine, would it not have been felled long ago? Moreover, what it preserves differs from what the common run preserves—how far removed is it to praise it with conventional standards!”\n\nMaster Nanbo Ziqi was wandering in Shangqiu when he saw a remarkable tree.

      "translated_text": "Seeing from what sets them apart, the liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue; seeing from what unites them, the myriad things are all one. Such being the case, he wanders his mind in the harmony of virtue without knowing what the ears and eyes deem fitting. He regards what things share as one and does not see what they lose—seeing the loss of a foot as one would leave behind a clod of earth.\n\nChangji said, \"He cultivates himself. Through his knowledge, he attains his mind; through his mind, he attains the mind that is constant. Why then do people hold him in such esteem?\"\n\nChangji, though he had heard Confucius’ words, still did not grasp why Wang Tai was as he was. That man, in cultivating himself—judging by his knowledge—possessed no divine wisdom but merely the understanding his thoughts could reach; judging by his mind, he had no sagely heart but only the mind common to all. Why then should people revere him?\n\nConfucius said, \"People do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water. Only stillness can still the many. Water is one, yet it has places where it flows and places where it rests. People do not go to its flowing parts to see their reflections but to its still parts. This illustrates that Changji need not view Wang Tai as extraordinary but should simply see him as one who has attained the constant mind. His excellence lies precisely in stillness. The many come to rest where the still water is—all streams return to it and cease their flow. Wang Tai, with his constant mind, transforms others in the same way.\n\nEndowed by earth, only the pine and cypress remain verdant through winter and summer. Endowed by heaven, only Shun alone was upright. Fortunate indeed that he could rectify his own life and thereby rectify the lives of all. This further clarifies the principle that only stillness can still the many. All grasses and trees receive their mandate from earth, yet only the pine and cypress remain green through winter and summer. All people receive their mandate from heaven, yet only Shun attained uprightness. Amid the chaos of countless deviations, were it not for Shun’s uprightness, nearly the whole world would have fallen into depravity. Fortunate that Shun could rectify his own life and thereby rectify the lives of all under heaven—thus we see that only stillness can still the many.\n\nThe proof of preserving one’s beginning lies in the substance of fearlessness. A single brave warrior can charge into nine armies. Those who seek fame and bind themselves to their resolve are already like this—how much more so one who governs heaven and earth, stores the myriad things, merely lodges in the six limbs, mirrors the ears and eyes, unifies the knowledge of knowing, and whose mind has never died!\n\nThe proof of preserving one’s beginning is that it must yield verifiable signs, making it trustworthy. The substance of fearlessness is that true courage does not depend on others’ recognition. The nine armies refer to the ancient military formation based on the well-field system, where each army was divided into nine units that took turns in battle. Those who seek fame are those who preserve their beginning, while those who bind themselves to their resolve embody the substance of fearlessness. To govern heaven and earth means to take heaven and earth as one’s office and steward them. To store the myriad things means to treat all things as one’s treasury. *Zhi* means \"merely.\" *Yu* means to lodge without attachment. *Xiang* means to mirror without being real. \"Unifying the knowledge of knowing while the mind has never died\" means unifying the knowledge that is known without the mind ever being trapped by things and perishing. This responds to the earlier lines: \"Through his knowledge, he attains his mind; through his mind, he attains the mind that is constant.\"\n\nThe preceding two lines show that even those who seek fame and bind themselves to their resolve can become braver than ten thousand men—how much more so Wang Tai, who unifies his physical form and mind, and is not to be compared with those who seek fame and bind themselves to their resolve! Could he not move the multitudes of Lu?\n\nHe will choose a day to ascend to the heights. People will then follow him. How would he deign to concern himself with things?\n\n*Jia* means \"to reach.\" *Dengjia* means \"ascending to immortality,\" rising to heaven. In the *Great Master*, it is written: \"Ascending to the heights of the Dao.\" It is also pronounced *ge*. Cui’s version compares him to the stars below, saying that though he has life, he has no parents or death, and after ascending for three years, his form vanishes—also meaning he rises to heaven. This means that one day he will ascend to immortality and leave the human world behind. This is why people follow him. From this perspective, how would he deign to concern himself with things? The word \"things\" here responds to the earlier \"Why then do people hold him in such esteem?\"\n\nDaoist traditions often speak of choosing a day to ascend to immortality. Shentu Jia—of the Shentu clan—was an amputee who studied under Bohun Wuren (in the *Miscellaneous Chapters*, written as *Maoren*) alongside Zichan of Zheng. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I leave first, you stay behind; if you leave first, I will stay behind.\" He was ashamed to walk alongside an amputee. The next day, they again sat together in the same hall. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I leave first, you stay behind; if you leave first, I will stay behind. Now I am about to leave—can you stay behind? Or not?\" He asked this to ensure they would not leave together. \"Moreover, when you see the one in power, you do not avoid him—do you consider yourself equal to the one in power?\" (Here, Zichan refers to himself as the one in power.)\n\nShentu Jia replied, \"In Master Bohun Wuren’s school, is there really such a thing as one in power? Those who dwell in the Master’s school should forget distinctions of noble and base. Yet you delight in your position of power and place others behind you. I have heard that when a mirror is bright, dust does not settle on it; if it settles, the mirror is not bright. When one dwells long with the worthy, one commits no errors. Dwelling with the worthy to avoid errors is like using a mirror to grind away dust. Now, what you take as most important is the Master—you take from others to enlarge your virtue.\"",
      "overlap_context": "\"\n\nChangji said, \"Though he is an amputee, he surpasses you, Master—how much more so the common run of men! If this is so, how does he employ his mind?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Life and death are great matters, yet they do not alter him. Though heaven and earth collapse and fall, he would not be lost with them. He examines what is without reliance and does not shift with things; he commands the transformations of things while guarding their root.\"\n\nChangji said, \"What does this mean?\"\n\nConfucius said:",

Following the previous mention of *fault*: if one states one’s faults, then one’s transgression is not great, and thus one suffers only amputation—those whose bodies are not deemed worthy of death are many. If one does not state one’s faults, others deem one’s crime extreme, deserving not merely amputation, and those whose bodies are not deemed worthy of life are few.

Confucius said, \"You were not careful, and already suffered such misfortune.

Now that I come, what remains of my honored foot still endures. *The right is honored*; though my left foot was amputated, my right foot remains. Thus I strive to preserve my wholeness. Heaven covers all without exception; Earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be like Heaven and Earth—how could I have known you would be thus, unable to bear my amputation?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"I am indeed coarse. Why not come in? Let me share with you what I have heard.\" Wuzhi departed.\n\nConfucius said, \"Disciples, take heed. Wuzhi, though a cripple, still strives to study and redress his past misdeeds—how much more should one of complete virtue do so!\"\n\nWuzhi said to Lao Dan, \"Is Confucius not yet a perfected person? Why does he show such deferential respect, treating his disciples as if they were his teachers? He seeks to make his name known through strange and marvelous deeds, unaware that the perfected person takes these as his own fetters.\"\n\nLao Dan said, \"Why not simply lead him to see death and life as a single thread, the permissible and the impermissible as a single strand, and thus free him from his fetters?

      "translated_text": "The full moon’s fullness is likened to a man’s belly. Yet he startles the world with his ugliness, harmonizing without leading, his wisdom confined to no realm—yet male and female gather before him. These three phrases mark a turn in the preceding passage. \"Male and female\" refer to the men and women [mentioned earlier]. There must be something extraordinary about him.\n\nI summoned him to observe, and indeed, his ugliness startled the world. Yet when he dwelt with me, before a month had passed, I took note of his character; before a full year had elapsed, I trusted him. With no minister in the state, I offered him the governance. He responded with hesitation, as if declining. I felt shame—was I the shameful one?—and so turned inward. In the end, I entrusted him with the state. Soon after, he left me and departed. I grieved as if bereft, as though the kingdom held no joy for me. What manner of man is he?\n\nConfucius said, \"I once journeyed to Chu and chanced upon piglets nursing from their dead mother. After a moment, they shivered, glanced about, then abandoned her and fled. They did not see themselves in her, nor recognize her as their kind. What they loved in their mother was not her form, but that which animated her form. When they no longer saw themselves in her, the piglets knew only that their sustenance was gone; when they no longer recognized their kind, it was because the milk no longer resembled what they had known. That which animates form is spirit. The piglets, unaware of their mother’s death, fled when the spirit no longer connected.\n\nThis illustrates that in former days, your dealings with Aitai Tuo were not an exchange of forms but of spirits. To lose him is like the piglets losing their mother’s spirit.\n\nThose who die in battle are not buried with funeral fans; those who have lost their feet do not cherish their shoes. In both cases, the root is gone. Form is the root, while the fan and shoes are mere adornments. The consorts of the Son of Heaven do not cut their nails or pierce their ears, for one who draws near the ruler must not mar their form. A man who takes a wife remains apart from court for a time—*The Rites* prescribe that one in three years’ mourning or newly wed does not serve. If one whose form is whole may yet be thus, how much more one whose virtue is whole?\n\nNow Aitai Tuo wins trust without speaking, draws near without merit, and makes men offer him their states, fearing only that he will not accept. He must be one whose talents are whole and whose virtue does not manifest in form.\"\n\nDuke Ai said, \"What does it mean for talents to be whole?\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"Life and death, existence and annihilation, success and failure, wealth and poverty, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the workings of fate. They alternate day and night before us, yet knowledge cannot fathom their beginning. Thus they cannot disturb harmony or enter the mind’s sanctuary. To make one’s joy unbroken, to let day and night flow without gap, and to meet all things with the springtime of the heart—this is to bridge the intervals and bring forth the season within. The season does not arise from the qi of yin and yang, but from one’s own heart. This is what it means for talents to be whole.\n\nWhat does it mean for virtue not to manifest in form? Stillness is the fullness of water at rest. It may serve as a model, for it preserves its inner stillness without outward disturbance. Virtue is the cultivation of inner harmony. When virtue does not manifest in form, things cannot depart from it. Duke Ai’s attachment to Aitai Tuo is such a case.\"\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Confucius’ disciple Minzi, \"At first, I thought that by facing south as ruler of the world, upholding the people’s order, and grieving over their deaths, I had attained the utmost understanding. Now, hearing the words of a perfected person, I fear I lack substance, have treated my body lightly, and lost my state. I and Kong Qiu are not lord and subject, but friends in virtue.\"\n\nYin Qi, Zhi Li, Wu Shen—one guarded the city gate by standing on tiptoe, another was a man of broken form, and the last had no heels.

      "translated_text": "The neck is called *dou*. *Jianjian* describes its slender, elongated appearance. Delighting in the heel-less man while gazing upon whole men, the duke found their necks thin and long—ugly and unworthy of regard. The *Rites of Zhou*’s \"Artificer\" states: \"He counts the eyes and measures the neck.\" The commentary notes: \"A long neck,\" suggesting *jian* and *gu* share the same meaning.\n\nAnother man with a great goiter like a jar or urn advised Duke Huan of Qi. The duke delighted in him, yet when he looked upon whole men, their necks seemed *jianjian*. Thus, virtue may excel while form is forgotten. If one does not forget what ought to be forgotten but forgets what ought not to be forgotten, this is called true forgetting. What ought to be forgotten is form; what ought not to be forgotten is virtue. Yet the world forgets virtue while clinging to form—this is true forgetfulness.\n\nTherefore, the sage wanders freely, yet deems knowledge a blight, restraint glue, virtue a bond, and skill trade. The sage does not scheme—why employ knowledge? He does not carve—why employ glue? He suffers no loss—why employ virtue? He hoards no goods—why engage in trade? These four are the fasting of Heaven. The fasting of Heaven is the sustenance of Heaven. Having received sustenance from Heaven, why seek it from man?\n\n*Nie* means ominous blight; *yue*, strict restraint; *jiao*, fixation; *jie*, obligation; *gong*, craft; *shang*, merchant. The sage’s heart wanders in Heaven, yet he regards the wise as ominous, the restrained as rigid, the virtuous as bound to obligation, and the skilled as mere merchants. The sage does not plot—why use cunning? He does not carve—why use glue? Having nothing to lose, why practice the Way? Having no desire for gain, why engage in trade? Of these four lines, two are direct statements, two are metaphors. The term *shang* prompts the fourfold repetition.\n\nIt is the nurturance of Heaven—what Heaven bestows is constant. Receiving Heaven’s nurturance is to be fed by Heaven. Having received sustenance from Heaven, why seek it from man? This is like attaining Heaven’s nobility and not pursuing man’s rank.\n\nPossessing the form of man but not the passions of man: with the form of man, one mingles among men; without the passions of man, right and wrong do not adhere to one’s person. How tiny and insignificant—this is what binds one to humanity! How vast and grand—to stand alone in Heaven’s completion. *Ao* means release, the idea of attaining through letting go. This speaks of having no passions. Below, the text cites the debate with Huizi to expound the meaning of no passions.\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi: \"Do men truly have no passions?\"\nZhuangzi replied: \"Yes.\"\nHuizi said: \"If a man has no passions, how can he be called a man?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"The Dao gives him his appearance, Heaven gives him his form—how can he not be called a man?\"\nHuizi said: \"If he is called a man, how can he have no passions?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"This is not what I mean by passions. What I call having no passions is that a man does not inwardly harm his body with likes and dislikes, but constantly follows nature without embellishing life.\"\nHuizi said: \"Without embellishing life, how can one preserve one’s body?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"The Dao gives him his appearance, Heaven gives him his form—he does not inwardly harm his body with likes and dislikes. Now you strain your spirit externally, exhaust your essence, lean against a tree chanting, or rest on a withered paulownia in slumber. Heaven chose your form, yet you clamor about ‘hard and white.’\"\n\nThe Dao gives him his appearance, Heaven gives him his form—this is nature. \"Not embellishing life\" means that human life has the natural endowment of Heaven, to which not a hair’s breadth of human effort may be added. *Gaowu* refers to what is now called withered paulownia. *Wutong* and *gaotong* are synonymous, though the term may apply to various types of paulownia. Only the withered paulownia is used for lutes and zithers, hence the name. \"Resting on it in slumber\" means the instrument is always at hand, so even in weariness or drowsiness, one still clings to it. Standing, one leans against a tree chanting; sitting, one rests on a withered paulownia in slumber—these are the deeds of one who strains the spirit and exhausts the essence, who spurns Heaven’s gift to engage in debates over \"hard and white.\"\n\n*The True Classic of Southern Florescence, Following the Original Text, Scroll Six* ends.\n*The True Classic of Southern Florescence, Following the Original Text, Scroll Seven* begins.",

If one can nurture it without harm, one may also complete one’s Heaven-appointed years without dying prematurely—this, too, is the fullness of knowledge.\n\nYet there is peril.\nFor knowledge must await something before it is *settled*, and what it awaits is precisely what is not settled.\nHow do we know that what I call Heaven is not man?\nOr that what I call man is not Heaven?\n\nEven so, in what is called knowing what man does, there remains cause for concern: though man may know it, he must still await Heaven before he attains certainty.\n*Settled* means *fixed*.\nYet what he awaits from Heaven is itself without fixity.\nAs with Yan and Robber Zhi, who lived long—goodness does not necessarily bring blessing, nor evil calamity—how then can we be sure that what I call Heaven does not belong to man, or what I call man does not belong to Heaven?\n\nOnly with the true person does true knowledge arise.\nThe true person alone truly knows the distinction between Heaven and man.\n\nWhat is the true person?\nThe true persons of old did not resist the few—though they gained little, they did not resent it.\nThey did not vaunt their achievements—though they succeeded, they did not inflate their qi.\nThey did not scheme for affairs—*affairs* encompasses all undertakings. They entrusted everything to spontaneity and did not plan ahead.\n\nSuch were they: when they erred, they did not regret; when they acted rightly, they did not congratulate themselves.\nSuch were they: they ascended heights without trembling, entered water without getting wet, entered fire without feeling heat—this is knowledge that has ascended to the utmost in the Dao.\n\nThus the true persons of old:\nIn sleep, they did not dream; in waking, they had no cares.\nTheir food was not savored; their breath was deep.\nThe true person’s breath reaches the heels; the common person’s breath reaches only the throat.\nDeep breath is as if stored in the feet; shallow breath emerges from the throat—though in truth, the *qi*-sea is the root of breath.\nThose who *qufu* (flatter and fawn) have constricted throats, their speech like lewd music.\n*Qufu* refers to those who ingratiate themselves with others. Their words, uttered between the throat, resemble wanton melodies.\nThe deeper one’s desires, the shallower one’s heavenly mechanism.\nThe *heavenly mechanism* is the natural movement of qi, that is, breath. Deep desires make breath shallow.\nThus those who *qufu* have deep desires, and their speech, like croaking, reveals a shallow heavenly mechanism.\n\nThe true persons of old did not delight in life, nor did they abhor death.\nThey did not rejoice in going forth, nor did they resist returning.\nThey came and went with effortless ease, nothing more.\nThey did not forget their beginning, nor did they seek their end.\nThey received and rejoiced in it; they forgot and returned to it.\nThis is called not using the mind to cast aside the Dao, not using man to assist Heaven—this is the true person.\n\nSuch were they:\nTheir minds were steadfast—*mind* here means *intent*, which did not wander.\nTheir demeanor was tranquil; their foreheads broad and smooth.\nTheir bearing was chill as autumn, warm as spring.\nTheir joy and anger passed through the four seasons, harmonizing with things without anyone knowing their limit.\n\nThus when the sage employs troops, he may destroy a state yet not lose the people’s hearts.\nHis beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet he does not act out of love for others.\nTherefore, one who delights in connecting with things is no sage;\nOne who has partiality is not humane;\nOne who relies on the seasons is not worthy—when primordial qi is undifferentiated, how can the four seasons be distinguished?\nOne who does not connect benefit and harm is no gentleman—when they are connected and made one, how can benefit and harm be distinguished?\nOne who pursues fame at the cost of self is no scholar;\nOne who loses self is not true—such cannot employ others, nor be employed by others.\n\nLike the ancient worthies—*Hujie*, *Wuguang* (a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time, whose ears were seven inches long), *Boyi*, *Shuqi*, *Jizi* (also called *Xuyu*; *Shizi* says Jizi’s name was *Xuyu*, though some say it was *Bigan*), *Jita*, *Shentu Di* (men of the Yin dynasty; *Xunzi* records that the latter carried a stone and drowned himself in the river)—they allowed themselves to be employed by others, followed others’ paths, yet did not follow their own.\n\nThe true persons of old:\nTheir appearance was fitting yet not cliquish—they harmonized with things without forming factions.\nThey seemed insufficient yet did not defer—humble and retiring, they did not lightly submit.\nThey were companionable yet not rigid—their bearing was relaxed and self-possessed, like a vessel with edges yet not hard or stubborn.\nThey were expansive yet not florid—their qi was vast and open, though empty, it was not merely ornamental.\nThey were buoyant, as if pleased!\nYet restrained, as if compelled!\n*Buoyant* means exuberant; *restrained* implies self-suppression.

      "translated_text": "Their affinity was boundless in their love of leisure, their oblivion so profound they forgot their own words. *Boundless* means continuous and unbroken; *oblivion* means abandonment and forgetting. Though their manner was sealed and impenetrable, with nothing to glimpse or trace, they remained forgetful, never boasting of themselves.\n\nThey took punishment as their foundation, ritual as their wings, wisdom as their timing, and virtue as their path. Taking punishment as their foundation meant they were lenient in their severity; taking ritual as their wings meant they could move through the world; taking wisdom as their timing meant they acted only when compelled by circumstance; taking virtue as their path meant that, like one who walks to the hills, they were seen as diligent in practice—yet their progress was natural.\n\nRitual is the root of personal conduct. The root serves as the foundation, while punishment aids governance. The law serves as wings; yet though punishment is established, it is tempered by leniency and does not kill, thus it can be the foundation. Though ritual is strict, it can be practiced throughout the world, thus it can be the wings. Virtue governs the natural—like the movement of the four seasons, it operates without deliberate intent to encompass all things. Like a traveler following a path, one responds to affairs not by force but by necessity, acting naturally. Thus, virtue’s cultivation is not forced, like accidental footprints on a mountain—those who do not understand may truly believe it is diligent effort. Therefore, their love of it was singular, and their lack of love was also singular.\n\nTheir singularity was singular, and their lack of singularity was also singular. The singular joined with Heaven as its companion; the non-singular joined with man as its companion. Heaven and man do not overcome one another—this is called the *True Person*. Those who loved it were fundamentally one with me; those who did not love it also regarded it as one. Thus, their oneness with me was singular, and their lack of oneness was also singular. The singular naturally joined with Heaven as its companion; the non-singular naturally joined with man as its companion. Heaven and man do not overcome one another—why then introduce likes and dislikes between them?\n\nLife and death are a matter of fate, as constant as night and day—this is Heaven. What man cannot interfere with is the nature of things. They took Heaven as their father and cherished it, yet how much more should they cherish what transcends it! Men take having a lord as better than themselves and die for it, yet how much more should they value what is true!\n\nWhen a spring dries up, fish find themselves stranded on land, breathing moisture onto one another, wetting each other with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it is better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao.\n\nThe nature of things is their true principle. Taking Heaven as one’s father means the father is the Heaven of the child. What transcends this is the Dao, loftier than the father. What is true in this Dao is the true lord. To be transformed by the Dao is to be dissolved in it, so that praise and blame vanish.\n\nLife and death are fate, like Heaven’s constancy of night and day—beyond human power to alter, an unchanging principle of things. One should return to this Dao alone. This Dao is more revered in man than lord or father, yet man does not realize it. Rather than entangling oneself in the fray of praise and blame, how much better to rise above it in this Dao.\n\nThe Great Clod burdens me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death—thus, to treat life well is to treat death well. Hiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh seems secure, yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry them away, and the unwitting will not know. Even when small and large are hidden appropriately, there is still escape. But to hide the world within the world is to leave no room for escape—this is the great truth of things.\n\nMen delight in possessing human form, yet if this form undergoes ten thousand transformations without end, how can its joy be measured! Thus, the sage wanders where things cannot escape and all are preserved. Embracing early death and old age, beginning and end—people emulate this, let alone the myriad things bound to it and awaiting the one transformation!\n\nTo treat life well and death well—this \"well\" belongs to the Creator. To embrace early death and old age, beginning and end—this \"well\" belongs to man. Embracing early death means that though one dies young, it is not a bad death. The one transformation differs from the ten thousand transformations: the ten thousand transformations are the myriad changes wrought by man, while the one transformation is the great leap, unbound by the Dao.\n\nReturning to life and death: life inevitably leads to death, yet those who cling to life and shun death still cannot escape. It is like hiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh, believing it secure—unaware that in the dead of night, the boat may be moved by a strong man, the mountain felled by force, all beyond expectation and unnoticed. Though the ravine is vast and the boat small, the marsh vast and the mountain small, each hidden appropriately, there is still escape. But to hide the world within the world is to leave no room for concealment—no place to flee. Thus, rather than hiding with intent, it is better to hide without intent.\n\nWhat is meant by \"hiding the world within the world\" is like tilling fields and digging wells, unaware of the Emperor’s power. The world, too, is a thing—thus, this is the great and constant truth of things. Earlier, only the nature of things was mentioned; here, \"constant\" and \"great\" are added, extending the analogy of hiding boats, mountains, and the world. It seems strange, so the word \"constant\" broadens it to the world, while \"great\" returns to the human body. Thus, it is said that even briefly possessing human form is cause for joy. What is precious about human form is that it contains ten thousand transformations—how can its joy be measured?",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the sage wanders where things cannot escape and all abide—this is what is meant by \"hiding the world within the world.\" The sage grasps the essence of hiding the world, enabling the people to nurture life, bury the dead, and suffer no plague of epidemics or calamities. Yet people still admire and emulate such governance—how much more so when the Dao is hidden within the body, for it is the root of the ten thousand things and the source of all transformation, nearer and more intimate than hiding the world. Is there anything easier?\n\nThe Dao has sentiment and sincerity, is without action and without form; it may be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen. It is self-originating, self-rooted, existing before heaven and earth, enduring since ancient times. It spiritually animates ghosts and gods, gives birth to heaven and earth. Before the Supreme Ultimate, it is not lofty; below the six directions, it is not profound. Born before heaven and earth, it is not ancient; older than antiquity, it is not aged.\n\nThe term \"Dao\" reveals the Great Ancestral Master as possessing sentiment and sincerity, being without action and without form—just as the *Qiwu* chapter states: it may be practiced, is trustworthy yet without visible form, has sentiment yet no shape. It has the sentiment of union, the sincerity of verification, yet no deliberate action and no tangible image. It may be transmitted orally but not handed over, attained in the heart but not seen with the eyes. For it is formless, the root of yin-yang and the five phases, existing before heaven and earth. Ghosts and gods rely on it for their numinosity, heaven and earth rely on it for their generation—this is what Laozi calls the \"root of heaven and earth.\" Humans share the same pivot with creation, so within the body there is also a Supreme Ultimate. Laozi and Zhuangzi’s discourse on the Dao extends only this far. Later generations borrowed metaphors like lead, mercury, dragon, and tiger to make it clearer and more accessible.\n\nIt is not lofty, not profound, not ancient, not aged—all are words of praise. Fu Xi grasped it to harness heaven and earth; Fuxi attained it to inherit the mother of qi. The Northern Dipper holds it, remaining unconfused through the ages; the sun and moon hold it, ceaselessly revolving. Kanpi grasped it to inherit Kunlun, seizing the mother of primordial qi—the Northern Dipper is the celestial axis. Sima Biao says: Kanpi is a spirit with a human face and beast’s body. Feng Yi attained it to roam the great rivers. Sima Biao says: According to the *Qingling Zhuan*, Feng Yi was a man from Dishou in Tongxiang, Huayin, who ingested eight minerals, became a water immortal, and is known as the River Earl. Another account says he drowned in the river on the gengzi day of the eighth month. Jianwu grasped it to dwell on Mount Tai. Sima Biao says: A mountain spirit who did not die until the time of Confucius. The Yellow Emperor attained it to ascend to the cloudy heavens; Zhuanxu grasped it to reside in the Dark Palace. The Yellow Emperor ascended to heaven through the Dao. The Dark Palace is the palace of the north. The *Monthly Ordinances* says: Its emperor is Zhuanxu, its spirit is Xuanming. Yuqiang holds it, standing at the North Pole. Sima Biao says: The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: On an islet in the Northern Sea there is a spirit with a human face and bird’s body, wearing two blue snakes as earrings and treading two red snakes, named Yuqiang. The Queen Mother of the West attained it, seated in Shaoguang. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says: The Queen Mother of the West resembles a human, with a dog’s tail and disheveled hair, wearing a sheng-ornament and skilled in whistling, dwelling by the banks of the Xun River. The *Inner Biography of Emperor Wu of Han* says: The Queen Mother of the West and the Lady of the Upper Prime descended to the emperor, beautiful in appearance, divine immortals. Shaoguang, according to Sima Biao, is a cave name. Cui says: a mountain name. Another says: the name of the empty realm in the west. None know her beginning, none know her end. These two lines refer to the Queen Mother of the West. Peng Zu attained it, living from the time of Youyu through the Five Lords; Li says: The Five Lords are Kunwu of Xia, Da Peng and Shiwei of Yin, and Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin in Zhou. Fu Yue grasped it to assist Wu Ding, ruling the world, riding the eastern cord and the tail of the Winnowing Basket to join the ranks of the stars. Sima Biao says: Fu Yue is a star above the tail, meaning he rode between the eastern cord and the tail of the Winnowing Basket. The Winnowing Basket and Dipper are the eastern cord of the Milky Way’s ford. Cui’s version adds twenty-two more characters here, but they are inappropriate to the meaning. From the beginning of this chapter to this point, the essentials of the Great Dao are fully expounded. Yet fearing people might cling rigidly, the following text further elaborates that life and death are both void, broadening their vision—akin to the teachings of the School of Principle and the School of Nature.\n\nNanbo Zi Kui asked Nü Ou: \"You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like that of a child. How is this?\" He replied: \"I have heard the Dao.\" Nanbo Zi Kui said: \"May I learn it?\" He said: \"Alas! How could you?\"",
      "overlap_context": "s, this is the great and constant truth of things. Earlier, only the nature of things was mentioned; here, \"constant\" and \"great\" are added, extending the analogy of hiding boats, mountains, and the world. It seems strange, so the word \"constant\" broadens it to the world, while \"great\" returns to the human body. Thus, it is said that even briefly possessing human form is cause for joy. What is precious about human form is that it contains ten thousand transformations—how can its joy be measured?",

      "translated_text": "You are not the right person for this.\n\nNow, there was one named Bu Liangyi who possessed the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might indeed become a sage. If not, to impart the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy indeed. Yet I still persisted in teaching him: after three days, he was able to put the world outside himself. Once he had put the world outside himself, I persisted further, and after seven days, he was able to put things outside himself. Once he had put things outside himself, I persisted further, and after nine days, he was able to put life outside himself. Only after putting life outside himself could he attain clarity at dawn. With a single dawn, he penetrated all—no need to wait for seven or nine days. After attaining clarity at dawn, he could perceive the solitary. After perceiving the solitary, he could transcend past and present. After transcending past and present, he could enter the realm of neither death nor life. That which kills life does not die; that which gives life to life does not live. Withering the form and deadening the heart is how one kills life yet does not die; indulging the passions and following desires is how one gives life to life yet does not live.\n\nAs a thing, it sends off all without exception, welcomes all without exception, destroys all without exception, and completes all without exception. Its name is *yingning*—tranquility through disturbance. *Jiang* means to send off.

Leaning against the doorway, he spoke to Zilai: \"How wondrous is the work of creation! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it turn you into a mouse’s liver? Or an insect’s limb?\"—for none can know into what form one might transform, or whether it may become something exceedingly small.\n\nZilai said: \"To parents, a child must obey their commands, no matter if they send them east, west, south, or north. The forces of yin and yang govern man no less than parents do. If they now draw near to my death and I refuse to heed them, I would be obstinate—what fault would lie with them? The great earth bears me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me in death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well.\n\n\"Now, when a great smith casts metal, if the metal leaps up and cries, *'I must become a* *Mo Ye* *sword!'* the smith would surely deem it ill-omened. Likewise, if one who has taken human form were to say, *'I am human! I am human!'* the Creator would surely deem them an ill-omened person. It is not necessary to insist on transforming into a human—what harm is there in becoming another thing? Now, if we take heaven and earth as a great furnace and creation as a great smith, where could one go and not be acceptable?\"\n\nThen Zilai fell into a peaceful slumber and awoke with a start—*peaceful* as in tranquil, and *awoke* as in the suddenness of waking. For life is but a dreamlike death, and death but an awakening.\n\nZisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Ziqin Zhang became friends and said to one another: \"Who among us can join together in non-joining, act for one another in non-acting? Who can ascend to heaven, roam the mists, soar boundlessly into the infinite, and forget life without end or limit?\" The three looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord—*soar* as in playful ascent. Since all three could do as they described, they no longer needed to respond, but simply exchanged smiles, their hearts free of discord. Thus they became friends, harmonious and without gap.",

      "translated_text": "When Zisang Hu died, his body had yet to be buried. Upon hearing this, Confucius sent Zigong to attend to the funeral rites. Zigong went to wait upon the proceedings—his task being to prepare the mourning rituals. As all three were men of Lu, Zigong was dispatched.\n\nThere, one wove reed mats, another plucked the zither, and together they sang in harmony:\n*\"Ah, come, Zisang Hu!*\n*Ah, come, Zisang Hu!*\n*You have returned to your true nature,*\n*While we still remain as men—oh!\"*\n\nZigong hastened forward and said, \"May I ask: is it proper to sing before the corpse?\"\nThe two looked at each other and smiled, saying, \"What does he know of the meaning of ritual?\"\n\"The essence of ritual arises from human feeling—if feeling does not stir, what use is ritual?\"\n\nZigong returned and reported to Confucius: \"What manner of men are they? They have cultivated their conduct to the point of disregarding their own forms, singing before the corpse without change of countenance. I have no words to describe them. What manner of men are they?\"\nConfucius said, \"They wander beyond the bounds, while I wander within them. Outer and inner do not reach one another—had I sent you to offer condolences, I would have been crude indeed. They are now companions of the Creator, roaming in the single qi of Heaven and Earth. *Bounds* here means the established norms. *Companions of the Creator* means they follow what gives them life and become one with it. Heaven and Earth generate all things through nothing more than a single qi; human life in the world is but a roaming within this single qi of Heaven and Earth. To them, life is an excrescent growth, death the bursting of a boil. If this is so, how could they know where life and death, before and after, truly lie? Borrowing from strange things, entrusting themselves to shared form; forgetting liver and gall, neglecting ears and eyes; circling through beginning and end, unaware of origin or end—vagrant beyond the dust, carefree in the work of non-action. How could they be muddled by worldly ritual, seeking to impress the eyes and ears of the crowd?\"\n\nZigong said, \"Then upon what bounds does the Master rely?\"\n*\"Muddled\"* means confused. *\"The eyes and ears of the crowd\"* refers back to the earlier question about ritual. Earlier, you spoke of wandering within bounds—now, seeing this, I wonder upon what bounds you rely.\nConfucius said, \"I am one of Heaven’s punished people. Yet even so, I share this with you.\"\nConfucius referred to himself: \"I cannot be like them—I am one of those punished by Heaven. Though this is so, I will share this Way with you.\"\nZigong said, \"May I ask what this bound is?\"\nConfucius said, \"Fish are made for water, men are made for the Dao. Those made for water dig ponds to be nourished; those made for the Dao find stillness without effort. *Bound* here means the method by which one attains mastery. Fish made for water dig ponds and are thus nourished; men made for the Dao find stillness without effort. Thus it is said: Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes, men forget one another in the arts of the Dao. Forgetting in rivers and lakes means no longer needing to dig ponds; forgetting in the arts of the Dao means no longer needing effortless stillness—being made for something is not as good as forgetting it.\"\n\nZigong said, \"May I ask about the *unconventional person*?\"\nConfucius was often out of step with the world, so Zigong asked about the *unconventional person*.\nConfucius said, \"The *unconventional person* is unconventional among men but equal to Heaven. Thus it is said: Heaven’s petty man is man’s noble man; man’s noble man is Heaven’s petty man.\"\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius, \"Mengsun Cai—when his mother died, he wept without tears, his heart felt no grief, and in his mourning station he showed no sorrow. Lacking these three, he yet overshadowed Lu with his mastery of mourning. Is it truly possible to gain a reputation without substance?\"\nYan Hui found this particularly strange.\nConfucius said, \"Mengsun Cai has exhausted it—he has advanced beyond knowledge. He surpasses those who know mourning rites. He sought simplicity but could not attain it—yet he has already simplified. Those who study the Dao desire to diminish their emotions but cannot; Mengsun Cai has already diminished his. Mengsun Cai does not know why he lives, nor why he dies. He does not know what to pursue first, nor what to follow after—whether death comes first or later. If he has transformed into a thing, does he wait for the transformations he does not know to reach him? And if he is about to transform, how could he know that he will not? If he is about not to transform, how could he know that he already has? *Transformed into a thing* refers to those already transformed; *transformations reaching him* refers to those not yet transformed. *Transformations he does not know* means those he does not realize have reached him. It is as if those who died earlier transformed into things, waiting for the transformations they do not know to reach them—yet those who are about to die, how could they know they will not transform? And those about not to transform, how could they know they already have? I and you are but dreamers who have not yet awakened—how could we know? Moreover, he has a startling form but an undamaged heart. *He* refers to those who study the Dao: though their physical changes may seem alarming, they do not harm the heart. He has a temporary dwelling but no emotional death. Human life in the world is fleeting as a single morning, yet this does not kill his emotions. Mengsun Cai alone awakens—when others weep, he weeps too, following their *so-ness*. *So* is a familiar term, like *you* or *thou*, the opposite of *I*. Parents are one’s close kin, while others may be called *you* or *thou*. Now Mengsun Cai merely awakens to others weeping and weeps with them—his weeping does not come from the heart but from their *so-ness*, treating his kin as if they were others’ kin. And yet, we call this *our* ears—how could we know what we truly mean by *our*?\"",
      "overlap_context": "ther: \"Who among us can join together in non-joining, act for one another in non-acting? Who can ascend to heaven, roam the mists, soar boundlessly into the infinite, and forget life without end or limit?\" The three looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord—*soar* as in playful ascent. Since all three could do as they described, they no longer needed to respond, but simply exchanged smiles, their hearts free of discord. Thus they became friends, harmonious and without gap.",

      "translated_text": "The base text originally had only the single character *qie* (且), but adding *ye* (也) softens the phrasing for readability. *Qiefu* (且夫) and *qie* (且) share the same meaning. Following the earlier *nai* (乃), the *wu* (吾) below naturally arises. Suppose Confucius were to say: \"Yet *we*—I and Yan Hui—dare not view our kin as Mengsun Cai does, treating them as if they were others’ kin, calling them *our* own. But how can we truly know what we mean by *our*?\"\n\nThe text below elaborates this meaning:\nYet have you ever dreamed of being a bird soaring to the heavens, or a fish diving deep into the abyss? Do you know whether the speaker now is awake—or dreaming? Ordinary dreams of fish or birds are not so strange, but to dream of being a crow flying straight to the sky, or a fish plunging directly into the depths—clearly, in that moment, one’s self *is* the bird or fish. Yet here we are, speaking now—how can we be sure this is waking? Might it not be the dream instead? Seen thus, what we call *our* own remains unknowable. Earlier, it was said, \"We are merely dreaming and have not yet awakened\"; now it is said, \"Even waking may be a dream\"—this goes a step deeper.\n\nOne arrives at joy before laughter, offers laughter before arranging it.\n*Zao* (造) means \"to reach\"; *shi* (适) means \"contentment.\" Joy naturally gives rise to laughter, but when one suddenly attains a state of perfect contentment, true delight arises before laughter can follow. Then, when laughter is spontaneously offered, it comes without preparation. *Pai* (排) means \"to arrange.\" Spontaneous laughter arises unconsciously, without need for deliberate arrangement—this illustrates the natural, uncontrived truth that does not depend on rigid adherence to ritual and propriety.\n\nTo submit to fate and embrace transformation is to enter the vast and solitary One.\nExpanding on *pai* (排): human life’s wealth or poverty, high or low status, are all predetermined, like the arrangements of creation—one should simply accept them. Death dissolves all, returning to nothingness, which carries the sense of vast emptiness. *Yi* (一) refers to the primordial state before the Great Ultimate divided. To \"enter the vast and solitary One\" is to return to that origin.\n\nYierzi visited Xu You and asked: \"How did Yao assist you?\"\nYierzi replied: \"Yao told me: 'You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness, and clearly distinguish right from wrong.'\"\nXu You said: \"Then why have you come to me now? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness, and mutilated you with right and wrong. How will you wander the boundless, carefree, and ever-shifting paths?\"\n*Zisui* (恣睢) describes unbridled freedom; *zhuanxi* (转徙) means unrestrained movement.\nYierzi said: \"Even so, I wish to wander within their bounds.\"\nXu You said: \"You cannot. The blind have no part in the beauty of brows and eyes, nor the color of faces; the sightless have no share in the splendor of blue and yellow, embroidered patterns and brocade.\"\n*Wutongzi* (无瞳子) refers to the blind; *gu* (瞽) refers to those with pupils but no sight.\nYierzi said: \"Yet Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang lost his strength—\"\nBoth are hypothetical names: *Wu Zhuang* (无庄) means \"without adornment,\" *Ju Liang* (据梁) means \"relying on brute force.\"\n\"—and the Yellow Emperor lost his wisdom, all through the refining fires of the forge.\"\n*Chui* (锤) is interchangeable with *zhui* (锤).\n\"How can we know that the Creator will not heal my branding and mend my mutilation, allowing me to ride the perfected Way and follow you?\"\nXu You said: \"Alas!\"",

His knowledge was true to reality, his virtue utterly genuine, and he had never entered the realm of the artificial.\n\nThe Lord of Yu harbored and concealed the Dao of benevolence to bind the hearts of men—thus he too won the people. Yet he still emerged from human contrivance, unlike one who abides in non-contrivance, where all things commune without communion. Hence it is said: *He had not yet transcended the realm of the artificial.* As for the Lord of Tai of High Antiquity, he dwelt in natural spontaneity, without deliberate action. Sometimes he took himself for a horse, sometimes for an ox, with no fixed designation. This was because the Lord of Tai’s knowledge was truly authentic, his virtue profoundly real. Unlike the Lord of Yu, who embraced benevolence to entice others, his state was not intentional. Thus it is said: *He had never entered the realm of the artificial.* The phrase *had not yet transcended* gives rise to the phrase *had never entered.*\n\nJian Wu met Jie Yu the Madman.

In governing the world, it would be like crossing the sea by digging a river or making a mosquito bear a mountain. If you use standards to regulate conduct, people would drown in the sea; digging a river would be impossible; a mosquito could not bear a mountain. Does the sage’s governance concern externals? He rectifies himself and then acts, firmly accomplishing only what he is capable of. Does the sage’s governance extend to externals? He merely fulfills what lies within his nature. He rectifies himself and then acts, firmly and truthfully doing only what he can. Moreover, birds fly high to avoid the harm of arrows and nets, and field mice burrow deep beneath sacred mounds to escape the peril of fumigation and excavation—yet you would call these two creatures witless! If a ruler sought to align people with laws and measures, they would all flee to avoid them. Birds and mice know to avoid harm—how much more so humans!

This illustrates where Liezi has yet to grasp its inner reality. Yet if you set the Dao in opposition to the world, can you truly expect others to believe you? If you insist on elevating the Dao above the world, how can you demand that people trust you? Thus, they will turn away from you.\"\n\nHuzhi said, \"Bring him here and let me test him.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Cheng to meet Huzhi. When they emerged, Ji Cheng said to Liezi, \"Alas! Your master is dead. He cannot live. He will not last ten days. I saw something strange—his qi resembled damp ashes.\"\n\nLiezi entered and, weeping until his robe was soaked, told Huzhi what had transpired. Huzhi said, \"I showed him the earthly pattern—still and unshaken, neither stirred nor disturbed. He saw only my sealed virtue-mechanism. Bring him again.\"\n\n\"Mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees are the earth’s patterns. When grasses and trees sprout, they rest in tranquil stillness, undisturbed, each following its own nature without need of correction. As the *Scripture of Salvation* says: 'The divine wind is silent; mountains and seas conceal the clouds. The heavens are free of drifting haze; the four qi are bright and clear. In a single land, earth and soil, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees lie level as one, no longer high or low.' This is what I mean by the sealed virtue-mechanism—concealed and unseeable. I showed him this, so he could not fathom me. Tell Liezi to bring him again tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Cheng to see Huzhi once more. When they emerged, Ji Cheng said to Liezi, \"Fortunate that your master met me! He is restored—fully alive! I saw his sealed adaptability.\"\n\nLiezi entered and reported this to Huzhi. Huzhi said, \"Earlier, I showed him heaven and earth—names and realities could not enter his mind, yet the mechanism stirred from the depths. He glimpsed only my good-mechanism. Bring him again.\"\n\n\"I saw his sealed adaptability—within concealment, there was flexibility, subtly different from yesterday’s sight. Sealed adaptability contrasts with sealed virtue. 'Heaven and earth' refers to the twelve celestial stems, the expanse of heaven. This term pairs with 'earthly pattern.' Earth governs stillness; heaven governs movement. By showing him heaven and earth, I meant that outwardly, names and realities could not penetrate his heart, while inwardly, the mechanism arose from the deepest place. Ji Cheng barely perceived the faint stirrings of my good-mechanism, yet much remained beyond his grasp. Tell him to return tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Cheng to see Huzhi again. When they emerged, Ji Cheng said, \"Your master is unsettled—I cannot divine him. Let him compose himself, and I will try again.\"\n\nLiezi entered and told Huzhi. Huzhi said, \"I just showed him the supreme harmony where nothing prevails—he saw only my balanced qi-mechanism. The depths of the *ni*-whirlpool, where Liezi writes *pan* (rice-water), should read *shen* (sediment), also meaning 'juice.' A still-water *shen* forms a deep pool; a flowing-water *shen* forms a deep pool. There are nine names for such pools, and here I used three. Bring him again after he has fasted to unify his mind.\"\n\n\"Supreme harmony\" refers to the great equilibrium, akin to the \"great peace.\" It lies between the sealed virtue-mechanism and the good-mechanism, with nothing surpassing it. The balanced qi-mechanism stands between earthly pattern and heaven-earth, where movement and stillness are evenly matched—this is equilibrium. The term \"balanced\" contrasts with \"adaptability\" above. By showing him the supreme harmony where nothing prevails, I meant the balanced qi-mechanism.\n\nThe *ni*-whirlpool is where the *ni* lingers. *Pan* is rice-water, the foam on a deep pool’s surface. A still-water *pan* forms a deep pool when water flows above but pools below. Where the *ni* lingers, where still water pools, where flowing water pools—all are called deep pools. The *Liezi*’s \"Yellow Emperor\" chapter lists nine names for deep pools: the *ni*-whirlpool’s *pan*, the still-water’s *pan*, the flowing-water’s *pan*, the overflowing-water’s *pan*, the surging-water’s *pan*, the rushing-water’s *pan*, the dammed-water’s *pan*, the Fen River’s *pan*, and the rich-water’s *pan*. *The Master of Huainan* also speaks of the nine-jade deep pools.

      "translated_text": "The *Du*-virtue mechanism remains utterly unmoving. The *ni*-whirlpool’s deep pool serves as a metaphor for heaven and earth. Though the adept’s mechanism resembles still deep-pool water, the presence of *ni* coiling within reveals a subtle motion amid stillness. The flowing-water deep pool illustrates the supreme harmony of unopposable forces, the balanced qi-mechanism—where water flows above and pools below, each half in perfect equilibrium—thus serving as an analogy for the *taichong* protective qi.\n\nIf one cannot grasp these three examples, how could one comprehend the rest? Therefore, permission was granted for another encounter. The next day, he was again brought before Master Huzǐ. Before standing firmly, the visitor lost composure and fled. Master Huzǐ said, \"Pursue him.\" Liezi chased but could not overtake him. Returning, he reported to Master Huzǐ: \"He has vanished, he is lost—I could not reach him.\"\n\nFrom his perspective, it was *vanished*; from ours, it was *lost*. Master Huzǐ said, \"Earlier, I showed him what had never yet departed from my lineage. I met him with emptiness and *weiyi* (yielding compliance), leaving him unsure of who was who, so he took me for a follower, for a drifting current—hence his flight. My lineage is that of the great lineage-master. *Weiyi* means compliance. *Unsure of who was who* means no distinction between self and other. *Follower* describes one who trails like a younger brother after an elder. *Drifting current* likens one to a wave carried by the flow. Though transformations are boundless, they never depart from the great lineage. The great lineage is the root-source of the Dao—nothing but emptiness, without division between you and me. Taking me for a follower or drifting current, he could not fathom my nature and so fled.\"\n\nThereafter, Liezi returned home, believing he had never truly begun to learn. For three years, he did not venture out, cooking for his wife, eating like a pig eats human food, remaining indifferent to all affairs. He carved away ornamentation to restore simplicity, standing solitary as an unhewn block. *Carved away ornamentation to restore simplicity* means stripping away embellishment to return to plainness.\n\nIn this tumultuous age of divided domains, one should conclude life with this alone. Do not be a master of fame, a repository of schemes, a bearer of tasks, or a lord of knowledge. Embody the boundless and wander without trace.

Sima [Biao] states: \"A man of the Yellow Emperor’s time who could see the tip of an autumn hair at a hundred paces.\" Another account says he could see the point of a needle at a thousand *li*. Mencius calls him Li Lou.\n\nWhat is excessive in hearing disrupts the five tones, indulges in the six pitch-pipes, and resounds with metal, stone, silk, bamboo, Huangzhong, and Dalü—is this not the case with Shi Kuang?\n\nWhat branches from humaneness plucks at virtue and obstructs nature to garner fame, causing the world to clamor in support of unattainable standards—is this not the case with Zeng [Can] and Shi [Qiu]?\n\n*Plucks* means to draw out. *Clamor* is like the stirring of a reed-organ’s pipes. *Zeng* refers to Zeng Can. *Shi* refers to Shi Qiu.",

      "translated_text": "Those who are paired in sophistry pile tiles and knot cords to craft elusive phrases, roaming their minds amid the rigid debates of \"hard\" and \"white,\" \"same\" and \"different\"—is this not the exhaustion of half-step reputations in useless words? And are not Yang [Zhu] and Mo [Di] the very ones?\n\n*Piling tiles* means stacking vessels without toppling them. *Knotting cords* means untying them with skill—small tricks of dexterity, likening the sophist’s art. *Elusive phrases* are evasive words. *Exhaustion* means weariness. *Half-step* refers to half a pace, as if the sophist’s labor were that of a worn-out man hobbling forward.\n\nThus, all these are the many paired and branching paths, not the ultimate correctness of the world. That which is truly correct—here, the first *correct* may be a scribal error for *ultimate*—does not lose the truth of its nature and destiny. Therefore, what is joined is not called *paired*, and what branches is not called *forked* (a term for feet with extra toes); what is long is not called excessive, and what is short is not called deficient. Hence, though the teal’s legs are short, lengthening them brings sorrow; though the crane’s legs are long, shortening them brings grief. Thus, what is long by nature must not be cut, and what is short by nature must not be extended—there is nothing to remove or add that would not cause distress.\n\nIs it not that humaneness and rightness run counter to human nature? Why else do those humane men bear so much sorrow? Moreover, those whose toes are paired—severing them brings weeping; those whose hands have extra fingers—cutting them brings wailing. Whether in excess of the proper number or deficient, their sorrow is the same. Now, the humane men of this age gaze with bleary eyes at the world’s calamities, while the inhumane tear at the truth of their nature and destiny to glut themselves on wealth and honor. Is it not that humaneness and rightness run counter to human nature?\n\nSince the time after the Three Dynasties, why has the world been so clamorously noisy? *Clamorous* (pronounced *xiāo*) is a sound—since the time after the Three Dynasties, why has the world’s discourse on humaneness and rightness been so noisily clamorous?\n\nThose who rely on hooks, marking lines, compasses, and squares to achieve correctness are carving away their nature; those who depend on inked cords, glue, and lacquer to achieve solidity are encroaching upon their virtue. Bending and folding with rites and music, cooing and murmuring about humaneness and rightness to soothe the world’s heart—this is to lose what is constant and natural. The world has its constancy: the curved do not need hooks, the straight do not need marking lines, the round do not need compasses, the square do not need squares, adhesion does not need glue and lacquer, and binding does not need ropes. Thus, the world grows abundantly of itself, unaware of how it grows; all attain their due, unaware of how they attain it. Therefore, from ancient times to the present, there is no duality—it cannot be diminished.\n\n*A hook* is a tool for drawing curves. *Abundantly* means flourishingly. The nine-character phrase thus treats ancient and modern as one, without sign of decay. Then why should humaneness and rightness cling like glue, lacquer, and ropes, wandering between the Dao and virtue? It only confounds the world. Zhuangzi and Laozi exalted the Dao and virtue while belittling humaneness and rightness, hence these words.\n\nMinor delusion confuses direction; major delusion alters one’s nature. How do we know this is so? Since the time of Yu’s dynasty, when humaneness and rightness were raised to disturb the world, none have not rushed to answer the call of humaneness and rightness. Is this not to exchange one’s nature for humaneness and rightness? Let us test this claim: since the time after the Three Dynasties, the world has not failed to exchange its nature for things.\n\nThe petty man sacrifices himself for profit; the scholar sacrifices himself for fame; the grandee sacrifices himself for his house; the sage sacrifices himself for the world. Though these several types differ in their undertakings and their reputations bear different names, their injury to their nature and their self-sacrifice are one.\n\nZang and Gu—according to the *Fangyan*, in the northern borders of Qi and the northern outskirts of Yan, a male who marries a slave woman is called *Zang*, and a female who marries a slave is called *Gu*; thus, taking *Zang* as a name for the good, they also name the other *Gu*—were two men who herded sheep together and lost them all.

Yet do clay and wood by nature desire to conform to compass, square, hook, and line? Still, generation after generation, people praise Bo Le for his skill in managing horses, and potters and carpenters for their mastery of clay and wood. This is also the error of those who govern the world.\n\nI believe those who truly excel at governing the world do not act thus. The people possess an enduring nature: they know to clothe themselves and till the soil to feed themselves—this is called shared virtue. Unified yet impartial, this is called the freedom of Heaven. Thus, in the age of utmost virtue, their movements are steady, their gaze unassuming. At that time, mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes no boats or bridges. The myriad things flourished together, bound to their native lands. Birds and beasts gathered in flocks and herds, grasses and trees grew to their fullness. Thus, one could lead birds and beasts by tether and wander among them, or climb to peer into the nests of magpies and crows. In the age of utmost virtue, humans dwelt alongside birds and beasts, their kind mingling with the myriad things. How could one distinguish between noble and base? Alike in their lack of cunning, their virtue remained unbroken; alike in their lack of desire, they were called uncarved simplicity. In uncarved simplicity, the people’s nature was fulfilled.\n\nYet when the sage arose, he hobbled and strained for benevolence, tiptoed and stretched for righteousness—and the world began to doubt. Steady and solid, not hollow or frivolous. Obscure and unadorned, not bright or dazzling. *Biexie* (limping) and *qiji* (tiptoeing) describe forced effort, thus illustrating the contrivance of benevolence and righteousness. Indulgence became music, restraint became ritual—and the world began to divide. *Chanman* (indulgence) means excess, like overflowing waters. *Zhaipi* (restraint) means picking out and correcting what is deviant.\n\nIf unhewn simplicity is not destroyed, who would fashion sacrificial goblets? If white jade is not shattered, who would carve ceremonial tablets? If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, why seek benevolence and righteousness? If nature and emotion remain unsevered, why employ ritual and music? If the five colors are not disordered, who would create patterned adornments? If the five tones are not confused, who would harmonize them with the six pitch-pipes? To mar simplicity into implements is the fault of the craftsman; to ruin the Dao and virtue for the sake of benevolence and righteousness is the error of the sage.\n\nNow, returning to the horse as a metaphor, let us advance the argument further.",

In joy, they cross necks and nuzzle in harmony; in fury, they part their backs to strike with their hooves. For when horses kick, they always direct their feet backward—hence the phrase \"turning their backs to kick.\" Thus, horses already possess this knowledge.\n\nYet when yokes and crossbars are imposed upon them—*heng* being the horizontal wood at the front of the carriage, *e* (the yoke) the device that restrains the horse’s neck—horses learn to feign armor’s edge, to sense the chokehold of city gates, to grow haughty and unruly, to deceive by accepting the bit, and to slip free of the reins. *Jie* means armor, for warhorses must wear it. *Yin* refers to city gates, which restrain treachery. *E* means to grasp, as city gates grasp and hold back villainy. *Zhiman* means arrogance and defiance. *Guixian* means feigning acceptance of the bit. *Qiepei* means stealing the reins beyond control. This describes how horses, familiar with human ways, foresee the signs of armor before donning it, anticipate the restraint of city gates before passing through, and thus become unmanageable—deceiving with the bit, slipping the reins—exhibiting such behavior.\n\nTherefore, that horses possess this knowledge and can even become thieves is the fault of Bo Le.\n\nIn the age of the赫胥氏, people knew not what to do nor where to go; they played with food in their mouths and wandered with bellies full.

      "translated_text": "Lujing Bamboo Peak’s Luo Miandao, as recorded by his disciple Peng Xiang, annotates:\n\n**Outer Chapters: \"Opening the Satchel\"**\n\nWhen one intends to pry open a satchel—*qu* (胠), meaning the armpit—it is as though reaching in from beneath the arm. Thieves who probe into bags to steal necessitate precautions: they must fasten cords and seals, *jianteng* (缄縢), the tools of binding and marking, and secure bolts and locks. *Jue* (鐍), pronounced as in *guxue* (古穴), refers to the bolt’s tongue; *jiong* (扃) means to latch. This is what the world calls \"wisdom.\"\n\nYet when a great thief arrives, he hoists the chest, shoulders the satchel, and carries off the bag, fearing only that the cords, seals, bolts, and locks are not secure enough. Thus, what was once called wisdom is it not merely amassing spoils for the great thief?\n\nLet us examine this: Is there any so-called wisdom in the world that does not accumulate for the great thief? Is there any so-called sageliness that does not guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so?\n\nIn ancient times, the cities and towns of Qi stood in sight of one another, the cries of chickens and dogs audible between them. Nets and snares spread wide, plows and hoes pierced deep—*lei* (耒) being the handle of the plow, *nou* (耨) the weeding tool, as described in the *Shuowen*: \"a blade six inches long, a handle three feet, its edge two inches broad.\" Within a territory of over two thousand *li*, encompassing all within its four borders, the establishment of ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain, the governance of cities, villages, districts, and hamlets—was there ever a time these did not follow the models of the sages?\n\nYet Tian Chengzi slew the ruler of Qi in a single day and stole his state. What he stole was not merely the state—he seized along with it the sagely laws of wisdom. Thus, Tian Chengzi bore the name of a bandit, yet lived in the security of Yao and Shun. Small states dared not condemn him; great states dared not punish him. For twelve generations, he held Qi—was this not the theft of the state *and* its sagely laws to safeguard his bandit’s life?\n\nTian Chengzi is Chen Chengzi Heng. In the twenty-second year of Duke Zhuang’s reign in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Chen killed its crown prince, Yu Kou. Gongzi Wan, styled Jingzhong, fearing disaster, fled to Qi and became Duke Huan’s minister of works, concealing his clan name as Tian, for Chen and Tian sound alike. Five generations later, Lizi Qi became a minister to Duke Jing, collecting taxes from the people with a small measure but distributing grain with a large one, thereby winning the people’s favor and seizing control of Qi’s governance. Finally, his descendant Chengzi Heng assassinated Duke Jian, enthroned Duke Ping, and received fiefs larger than the duke’s own, ruling through Xiangzi Ban. Zhuangzi writes this in the time of King Xuan, hence \"eleven generations held Qi.\" Though Tian He had not yet usurped the state, the replacement of Jiang by Tian had already appeared in divination, so it is counted together.\n\nLet us examine further: Is there any so-called supreme wisdom in the world that does not accumulate for the great thief? Is there any so-called supreme sageliness that does not guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so?\n\nIn former times, Long Feng was beheaded, Bi Gan was disemboweled, Xi Zhong was torn apart, and Wu Zixu was torn to shreds—*mi* (靡) meaning *xumi* (胥靡), where *xu* (胥) is \"mutual\" and *mi* (靡) is \"to follow,\" a lighter punishment where offenders, clad in coarse cloth and bound with ropes, labored in chains. Though these four were virtuous, they could not escape execution.\n\nThus, the followers of Robber Zhi asked him: \"Does theft also have a Way?\" Zhi replied: \"Where can one go without a Way? To divine the treasures hidden in a chamber—that is sageliness. To enter first—that is courage. To exit last—that is righteousness. To know what is possible and what is not—that is wisdom. To divide spoils equally—that is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world has ever become a great thief.\"\n\nFrom this, we see that the good cannot stand without the Way of the sages, nor can Zhi act without it. Since the world’s good people are few and the unvirtuous many, the sages benefit the world little but harm it much. Thus it is said:\n\nWhen the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold;\nWhen Lu’s wine was thin, Handan was besieged.\n\nAs the *Shiwen* explains: Handan was the capital of Zhao. King Xuan of Chu summoned the feudal lords, but Duke Gong of Lu arrived late with weak wine. Enraged, the king sought to humiliate him, but the duke refused, saying: \"I am a descendant of the Duke of Zhou, elder among the feudal lords, practicing the rites and music of the Son of Heaven, with merit in the Zhou house. Though my wine was improper, to reproach its thinness is excessive.\" He departed without leave. The king, furious, sent troops with Qi to attack Lu. King Hui of Liang had long wished to strike Zhao but feared Chu, which was aiding Lu. Thus, Liang besieged Handan. Events follow one another—another account, from Xu Shen’s commentary on the *Huainanzi*: At a gathering of feudal lords, Lu presented wine to the King of Chu. Lu’s wine was thin, Zhao’s thick. The king’s wine steward demanded wine from Zhao, but Zhao refused. The steward, enraged, swapped Zhao’s thick wine for Lu’s thin one and presented it to the king, who then besieged Handan on the pretext of Zhao’s weak wine.\n\nWhen sages arise, great thieves appear. Abandon the attack on sages, release the restraint on bandits, and the world will begin to be ordered. When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. Once sages die, great thieves will not rise, and the world will be at peace without incident.\n\nAs long as sages do not die, great thieves will not cease. Though one may exalt sages to govern the world, this is but to enrich Robber Zhi. Fashion measures and bushels to quantify, and they will be stolen along with the measures; fashion scales and weights to weigh, and they will be stolen along with the scales; fashion tallies and seals to authenticate, and they will be stolen along with the tallies; fashion benevolence and righteousness to correct, and they will be stolen along with benevolence and righteousness.",

      "translated_text": "How do we know this is so? Those who steal a belt-hook are executed, while those who steal a state become lords. Where the gates of lords stand, benevolence and righteousness abide. Are these not the theft of benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom? Thus, in the wake of great thieves—following the example of Deng Xi—lords arise, seizing benevolence and righteousness along with the gains of measures, scales, tallies, and seals. Though offered the rewards of high rank, none can be induced; though threatened with the axe, none can be deterred. That such great profit for Robber Zhi cannot be restrained is the fault of the sages.\n\nThus it is said: \"The fish must not leave the depths; the state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others.\" Those sages are the state’s sharpest tools, not what should be displayed to the world. Therefore, sever sageliness and cast off wisdom, and great thieves will cease; pluck out jade and shatter pearls, and petty thieves will not arise; burn tallies and break seals, and the people will return to simplicity; smash the steelyard and snap the balance, and the people will know no contention. To \"use simplicity to harmonize seals, use contention to harmonize scales\"—here, the text plays with words. Exhaust and destroy the world’s sagely laws, and only then may the people be fit for discussion. Confound the six pitch-pipes, melt down the zithers and lutes, deafen the ears of Music-Master Kuang, and the world will begin to preserve its hearing. Erase patterns, scatter the five colors, blind the eyes of Li Zhu, and the world will begin to preserve its sight. Break the marking-line and discard the compass and square, sever the fingers of Craftsman Chui, and the world will begin to possess its skill. Thus it is said: \"Great skill appears clumsy.\"\n\nCut short the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silence the mouths of Yang and Mo, cast aside benevolence and righteousness, and the world’s virtue will begin to merge in profound unity. When people preserve their sight, the world will not be dazzled; when they preserve their hearing, the world will not be burdened; when they preserve their knowledge, the world will not be deluded; when they preserve their virtue, the world will not be perverse. Those like Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo, Music-Master Kuang, Craftsman Chui, and Li Zhu all set their virtue outward and thereby dazzle and confuse the world—useless to the law.\n\nDo you alone not know of the age of perfect virtue? In ancient times, under the reigns of Rongcheng, Dating, Bohuang, Zhongyang, Lilu, Lixu, Xuanyuan, Hexu, Zunlu, Zhu Rong, Fuxi, and Shennong, the people knotted cords for use. They savored their food, admired their clothing, delighted in their customs, and rested content in their dwellings. Neighboring states were within sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs carried to one another, yet the people grew old and died without ever traveling between them. In such an age, perfect governance was already achieved.\n\nNow, however, it has come to this: the people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, \"In such-and-such a place there is a worthy,\" and carrying provisions, they rush toward him. They abandon their parents at home and forsake their lords’ service abroad. Footprints crisscross the borders of the states; carriage tracks entangle a thousand *li* beyond. This is the fault of those above who prize knowledge. If those above truly prize knowledge and lack the Way, the world will be thrown into great chaos.\n\nHow do we know this is so? When knowledge of bows, crossbows, nets, and snares multiplies, birds are thrown into confusion above; when knowledge of hooks, bait, traps, and weirs multiplies, fish are thrown into confusion in the water; when knowledge of fences, nets, and traps multiplies, beasts are thrown into confusion in the marshes; when knowledge of deceit, gradual poison, contention, sophistry, \"hard and white,\" and \"same and different\" multiplies, the common folk are bewildered by disputation. (Here, the text follows the earlier pattern, presenting three examples: \"deceit and gradual poison\" refers to knowledge used to deceive, accumulating into poison; \"hard and white\" refers to obstinately insisting on whiteness; \"same and different\" refers to conflating difference into sameness—all terms found in the writings of Gongsun Long. \"Contention\" means competing for superiority; \"sophistry\" means shifting and evasive argument. Those who obstinately insist on whiteness and dispute it engage in contention, making others shift and evade. \"Dissolving\" means scattering; \"dirt\" refers to the grime of the body. \"Dissolving dirt and sameness\" means scattering sameness as if shedding grime. The first phrase speaks of knowledge, the next two of disputation.)\n\nThus, the world is repeatedly thrown into great chaos, and the blame lies in the love of knowledge. The world all knows to seek what it does not know yet does not know to seek what it already knows; all knows to condemn what it does not consider good yet does not know to condemn what it already considers good. Thus, great chaos arises. Above, it confounds the brightness of sun and moon; below, it scorches the essence of mountains and rivers; in between, it topples the operations of the four seasons. Even the tiniest wriggling creatures and the smallest sprouting plants lose their nature. How severe is the chaos wrought by the love of knowledge—this has been the case since the Three Dynasties and after!\n\nAbandon the people of all kinds (here, \"kind\" is read in the rising tone, meaning categories—one type alone, without distinction or excellence) and delight instead in the flattery of the fawning; forsake the tranquil and effortless and delight instead in the restless scheming of the clever. Such restless scheming has already thrown the world into chaos.\n\n*The Eleventh Scroll of the Circulating Edition of the True Classic of Southern Florescence is complete.*\n*The Twelfth Scroll of the Circulating Edition of the True Classic of Southern Florescence.*",

To \"in\" it is to fear the world may indulge its nature; to \"you\" it is to fear the world may alter its virtue. If the world neither indulges its nature nor alters its virtue, is there any need to govern it?\n\nWhen Yao governed the world, he made it brim with joy—people delighted in their nature, yet this was not tranquility. When Jie governed the world, he made it languish in exhaustion—people suffered in their nature, yet this was not contentment. That which is neither tranquil nor content is not virtue; and nothing lacking virtue can endure long. The phrase \"in-you\" may have been current in those days, but today it reads strangely. As in the *Book of Songs*, where \"you-mi\" appears, \"in\" suggests letting things be as they are, while \"you\" means to allow. \"You\" is to be lenient. To \"in-you\" the world is to act without contrivance. To govern the world is to impose rites, music, punishments, and policies. If one \"ins\" and \"yous\" it, how can there be governance?\n\nThe exuberance of \"brimming with joy\" arises from a lack of \"inning\"; the exhaustion of \"languishing\" stems from a lack of \"you-ing.\" When one is excessively joyful, one aids the yang; when excessively angry, one aids the yin. \"Aids\" means to strengthen. Joy belongs to yang; anger to yin. When yin and yang are balanced in the body, there is no illness. But if joy is excessive, it strengthens yang to dominance; if anger is excessive, it strengthens yin to dominance. When both yin and yang are over-aided, the four seasons fail to arrive, the harmony of cold and heat is disrupted, and the body is harmed in return. This analogy of the four seasons’ yin and yang illustrates the yin and yang within the human body.\n\nIf people’s joy and anger are misplaced, their dwellings unsettled, their thoughts restless, and their conduct inconsistent, then the world begins with the unruly and the fierce, and later produces the deeds of Robber Zhi and Zeng Shen. \"Inconsistent conduct\" means actions that start but fail to follow through with order. \"Unruly and fierce\" describes those who cannot be controlled.\n\nThus, even if the entire world were marshaled to reward the good, it would not suffice; even if the entire world were marshaled to punish the wicked, it would not be enough. The world is too vast for rewards and punishments to be adequate. Yet since the Three Dynasties, rulers have clamored endlessly over rewards and punishments—how could they have had leisure to preserve the natural state of their lives? This passage on rewards and punishments arises from the discussion of joy and anger.\n\nMoreover, to delight in brightness is to indulge in form; to delight in keen hearing is to indulge in sound; to delight in benevolence is to disorder virtue; to delight in righteousness is to defy principle; to delight in ritual is to turn it into a craft; to delight in music is to turn it into licentiousness; to delight in sagacity is to turn it into artifice; to delight in knowledge is to turn it into fault-finding. How can the world then preserve the natural state of its life?\n\nThese eight may exist or not—either way, the world will not preserve the natural state of its life. But when these eight are present, they begin to entangle and ensnare the world in chaos. \"Aid\" means to assist, which is not natural. Ritual involves ornamentation, hence it becomes a craft; sagacity involves many skills, hence it becomes artifice; knowledge involves scrutinizing others’ faults, hence it is called fault-finding. \"Entangle\" describes a coiled, constricted state; \"ensnare\" suggests a flurry of meddling. Yet the world venerates and cherishes these things—how profoundly mistaken it is!\n\nIs it merely a matter of passing them by? No, people purify themselves to discuss them, kneel to present them, and drum and sing to dance for them. What am I to make of such things? \"Kneeling to present them\" echoes Laozi’s \"sitting to advance\"—what am I to make of such people?\n\nThus, when the noble person is compelled to oversee the world, nothing is better than non-action. Only through non-action can the natural state of life be preserved. Therefore, one who risks their life for the world may be entrusted with it; one who cherishes their life for the world may be charged with it. But one who values and cherishes their life more than governing the world is truly fit to be entrusted with it.\n\nThus, if the noble person can refrain from loosening their five viscera or flaunting their intelligence, abiding like a corpse yet manifesting like a dragon, silent as an abyss yet thundering like a storm, moving with spirit so that Heaven follows, and acting with ease so that the myriad things rise and flourish—then why would I presume to govern the world? \"Loosening\" and \"flaunting\" both harm the self. \"Abiding like a corpse\" means sitting motionless; \"manifesting like a dragon\" means transforming like a dragon. \"Silent as an abyss yet thundering like a storm\" describes stillness that contains movement, not mere lifelessness. \"The myriad things rise and flourish\" means all things are nurtured within one’s generative power, like steam accumulating to cook food.\n\nCui Qu asked Lao Dan: \"If one does not govern the world, how can the human heart be settled?\" Lao Dan replied: \"Be cautious—do not agitate the human heart. The human heart presses downward yet surges upward, rising and falling like a prisoner. It is pliant yet strong, sharp yet carved, scorching like fire, freezing like ice. In the blink of an eye, it can reach beyond the four seas. At rest, it is deep and still; in motion, it soars to Heaven. Proud and untamable, is it not the human heart alone?\n\nThis describes the human heart in extremes: when pressed, it shrinks and retreats; when spurred, it leaps and ascends. When pressed downward, though momentarily subdued like a prisoner, its indignation remains. When urged upward, if left unchecked, its fury can kill.",

      "translated_text": "Soft yet able to be firm—this is the heart’s pliancy yielding to strength. Sharp yet carved and polished—this is the heart’s hardness made supple. All these characters refer to the heart. *Ji* means swift; *fu* means to traverse. *Qi* means movement. \"Suspended to Heaven\" describes the heart in motion, as if hung from the sky. *Fènjiāo* is an unstoppable force.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to agitate the human heart. Yao and Shun, in their devotion, wore their thighs smooth of down and their shins bare of hair, exhausting their bodies to nurture the world. They fretted over their five viscera to enact benevolence and righteousness, strained their blood and *qi* to establish laws and measures—yet still, they could not prevail. Yao banished Huan Dou to Mount Chong, executed the Three Miao at Sanwei, and exiled Gong Gong to Youdu—this was his failure to master the world. By the time of the Three Kings, the world was thrown into great turmoil. Below, there were Jie and Robber Zhi; above, Zeng and Shi; and the Confucians and Mohists all arose. Thus, joy and anger bred suspicion, the foolish and the wise deceived one another, the good and the bad reviled each other, and truth and falsehood mocked one another—so the world declined. Great virtue diverged, and human nature and destiny dissolved into chaos. The world prized cunning, and the people exhausted themselves. Then came axes and saws, inked cords and chisels, to carve and shape them. The world was bound in fetters, trembling with fear, tiptoeing as if shackled. The great disorder lay in agitating the human heart. Thus, the worthy hid in the caves of great mountains, while the lords of ten thousand chariots trembled in their ancestral halls.\n\nIn this age, the executed lie piled upon one another, the imprisoned press shoulder to shoulder, and the punished stretch as far as the eye can see—yet the Confucians and Mohists still stretch their toes and wave their arms in the midst of fetters. *Líqì* means standing on tiptoe; *rǎngbì* means raising one’s arms to argue—both hands and feet in motion. Alas! How shameless they are, yet feel no shame! I do not know whether the wisdom of sages does not become the interlocking beams of a prison frame, or whether benevolence and righteousness do not become the shackles and chisels of a mortise. How do we know that Zeng and Shi are not the arrows of Jie and Robber Zhi? Arrows and bows are tools for harm—this means Zeng and Shi are but instruments for Jie and Robber Zhi. Therefore it is said: \"Abandon sagacity, discard knowledge, and the world will be greatly ordered.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor ruled as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, his commands obeyed throughout the world. Hearing that Master Guangcheng dwelt on Mount Kongtong—*Erya* says: \"North of the Dipper’s handle lies Kongtong Mountain\"; another account places it thirty *li* east of Yucheng in Liang—he went to see him, saying: \"I have heard that you have attained the perfection of the supreme Dao. I venture to ask: what is the essence of the supreme Dao? I wish to gather the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to govern *yin* and *yang* to bring life to all beings. How may this be done?\"\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: \"What you ask about is the substance of things; what you wish to govern is the remnant of things. What you inquire of is the fundamental essence of the Dao in things, while what you seek to control—*yin* and *yang*—is but their scattered residue. Since you began to govern the world, clouds gather before they amass into rain, plants wither before they yellow, and the light of the sun and moon grows dim. As for the petty minds of flatterers—how could they be worthy of discussing the supreme Dao?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white grass, and lived in seclusion for three months. Then he returned to seek the master again. Master Guangcheng lay with his head to the south. The Yellow Emperor approached from downwind, crawling on his knees, bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and asked: \"I have heard that you have attained the perfection of the supreme Dao. I venture to ask: how may one cultivate the body to attain longevity?\"\n\nMaster Guangcheng rose with a frown and said: \"Excellent question!\"",

Yet those who inherit their teachings today merely engage in empty talk and sophistry, never grasping the reality.\"\n\nHe bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, rose, took his leave, and departed.\n\nThe common people all delight when others are like themselves and detest when others differ from themselves. Those who desire likeness and reject difference do so with the aim of standing out from the crowd. Yet those who aim to stand out from the crowd—have they ever truly stood out? Relying on the crowd to secure what they have heard, they are no better than the many. If someone differs from them, it is only because that person refuses to submit. Thus, they delight in those who are like themselves and detest those who differ, wishing all to submit and thereby surpass the crowd. Yet those who aim to stand out from the crowd—have they ever truly stood out? Only when all agree with them and no dissenting voices remain do their ears find peace. In this way, what they can do is far less than what the many can do. How have they ever stood out from the crowd?\n\nThose who would rule others’ states grasp at the advantages of the Three Kings while blind to the perils. This is to gamble with others’ states. How many gambles do not end in the ruin of others’ states? The chance of preserving another’s state is less than one in ten thousand, while the chance of ruining it is more than ten thousand to one if even a single misstep is made. How lamentable that those who possess lands do not understand this.\n\nTo speak of governing a state is to speak of standing out from the crowd. Those who possess lands possess a great thing. Possessing a great thing, one cannot be possessed by things. Only by not being possessed by things can one master things. Understanding that those who master things are not things themselves—how could this apply only to governing the world’s people? Moving in and out of the Six Directions, roaming the Nine Provinces, coming and going alone—this is called \"possessing alone.\" Those who possess alone are called \"most noble.\"\n\nA great thing is simply one great thing. \"Mastering things\" means dividing them by their kinds. \"Not being possessed by things\" means not being enslaved by things. The world is one undivided great whole—how can it be split into separate things? Only those who are not enslaved by things can govern its myriad details without being disturbed by their profusion. Thus it is said: \"Not being possessed by things, one can master things.\" Realizing that those who master things are not things themselves—how could this apply only to governing the world without the trouble of trivialities? Those who attain the Way alone are most noble and thus able to stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe teaching of the great person is like a shadow following form, an echo answering sound. When questioned, they respond, exhausting what is in their heart, matching heaven’s measure. Abiding where there is no echo, moving where there is no direction, they lead you to wander and return, stirring and roaming without end. \"Wander and return\"—to go and come back. Leading you to go and return, the restless people roam without end. Moving in and out without sides, with the sun without beginning, they praise and discuss the body, merging into great unity without self. Without self, how could there be anything seen? Those who see are the noble ones of old; those who see nothing are friends of heaven and earth.\n\nThat which is lowly yet cannot be shunned is things. That which is humble yet cannot be ignored is the people. That which is hidden yet cannot be avoided is affairs. That which is coarse yet cannot be omitted is laws. That which is distant yet cannot be abandoned is righteousness. That which is close yet cannot be narrowed is benevolence. That which is measured yet cannot be unaccumulated is ritual. That which is centered yet cannot be unexalted is virtue. That which is one yet cannot be unchanging is the Way. That which extends yet cannot be unenacted is heaven.\n\nThus the sage observes heaven yet does not assist, completes virtue yet is not burdened, emerges from the Way yet does not scheme, meets benevolence yet does not rely on it, approaches righteousness yet does not accumulate it, responds to ritual yet does not conceal, engages with affairs yet does not refuse, equalizes laws yet does not disorder, relies on the people yet does not belittle them, follows things yet does not abandon them. Things are not worth acting upon, yet they cannot be left unacted upon.\n\nThose who do not understand heaven are not pure in virtue. Those who do not comprehend the Way have no ground to stand upon. Those who do not understand the Way—how lamentable!",

That which is revered through non-action is the Dao of heaven; that which is burdened through action is the Dao of man. The ruler embodies the Dao of heaven; the minister embodies the Dao of man. The distance between the Dao of heaven and the Dao of man is vast—this cannot but be examined.\n\nThis chapter’s meaning is shallow. If one’s words falter, they will surely be like a dog’s tail appended to sable fur.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve of the *Xunben* Edition of the *True Classic of Southern Florescence* concludes here.**\n*(Variant notes: #1 The received text reads ‘昔’ for ‘者’. #2#3 The received text reads ‘卓’ for ‘早’. #4 The received text reads ‘山’ for ‘上’.)*\n\n**Chapter Thirteen of the *Xunben* Edition of the *True Classic of Southern Florescence***\n*Recorded by Lu Lingzhufeng’s Luo Miandao, punctuated by his disciple Peng Xiang*\n\n**Outer Chapters: Heaven and Earth**\n\nThough heaven and earth are vast, their transformations are uniform; though the myriad things are numerous, their governance is one; though the people are many, their lord is singular. The lord originates in virtue and is completed by heaven. Thus it is said: The ancient rulers of the world practiced non-action—nothing more than the virtue of heaven.\n\nViewing words through the Dao, the lords of the world are rectified; viewing distinctions through the Dao, the righteousness of lord and minister is clarified; viewing abilities through the Dao, the offices of the world are well-ordered; viewing broadly through the Dao, the responses of the myriad things are complete.\n\nThus, that which pervades heaven and earth is virtue; that which courses through the myriad things is the Dao; that which governs people is affairs; that which possesses skill is technique. Technique is encompassed by affairs, affairs by righteousness, righteousness by virtue, virtue by the Dao, and the Dao by heaven. Thus it is said: Those of old who nurtured the world had no desires, yet the world was sufficient; practiced non-action, yet the myriad things were transformed; were profound and still, yet the hundred clans were settled.\n\nThe *Record* states: \"Comprehending the One, all affairs are complete; without intent, one attains it, and even ghosts and spirits submit.\"\n\nThe Master said: *(Note: These two instances of \"the Master said\" are treated as separate chapters in the Cui edition, but when connected to the preceding text, they serve as corroborating quotations. If detached, they lack coherence. It is suspected that \"the Master\" here refers to Laozi. The preceding quotation from the *Record* is also Laozi’s, so this continues his words. Otherwise, it would be one whom Zhuangzi revered. The later passage where \"the Master asked Lao Dan\" clearly refers to Confucius.)*\n\nThe Dao—it covers and bears the myriad things, vast and boundless! The noble person cannot but hollow out their heart. *(Hollow out the heart of its emotions and desires. The following text elaborates Zhuangzi’s exposition.)*\n\nNon-action as action is called heaven; non-action in speech is called virtue; loving people and benefiting things is called benevolence; unifying differences is called greatness; acting without eccentricity is called magnanimity; possessing myriad distinctions is called wealth.\n\nThus, holding to virtue is called discipline; the completion of virtue is called establishment; following the Dao is called fulfillment; not allowing things to wear down the will is called perfection. When the noble person is enlightened regarding these ten, they conceal their affairs in profound obscurity.\n\nThe greatness of the heart—how it surges forth, becoming the passage for the myriad things! Affairs are stored, yet the heart is not cramped; things depart, yet the heart does not linger.\n\nThose who are thus store gold in the mountains and pearls in the abyss; they do not prize wealth or draw near to nobility and riches; they do not delight in long life nor grieve over early death; they are not honored by success nor shamed by poverty. They do not confine the world’s benefits to their private share, nor do they take ruling the world as their own exalted position. *(Exalted, yet their fundamental heart remains luminous as ever.)* All things are one storehouse; death and life share the same form.\n\nThe Master said: The Dao—profound is its abode, limpid is its clarity! Even metal and stone cannot remain silent. *(Metal and stone have voices, but without striking, they do not sound.)* Who among the myriad things can determine it?\n\n*(Abode means stillness. 漻 (liú) describes the appearance of clear water. The fundamental nature of the Dao is like water, profound in its stillness, thus limpid in its clarity. It is also like metal and stone, which inherently possess their qualities—when struck, they resound. Extending this to water and metal, the principles of the myriad things are no different, yet people cannot discern and determine them.)*\n\nThose of kingly virtue move plainly yet are ashamed to be entangled in affairs; they establish their root and origin, and their knowledge communicates with the divine. Thus their virtue is vast. *(Kingly virtue: their virtue suffices to rule the world. Plainly moving: as in the common saying, \"plainly treading forward.\" Those of kingly virtue maintain a tranquil heart and regard entanglement in affairs as shameful. Yet by establishing their root and grasping the essential Dao, their wisdom naturally communicates with the divine, so their virtue is vast and suffices to rule the world.)*\n\nWhen their heart emerges, things adorn it. Thus, form does not arise without the Dao; life does not become luminous without virtue. Preserving form and exhausting life, establishing virtue and illuminating the Dao—is this not the mark of one of kingly virtue?\n\nVast and boundless! Suddenly emerging, suddenly moving, and the myriad things follow—this is what is called one of kingly virtue! *(This further elaborates from the perspective of the human heart. When the heart emerges, things adorn it—this is what is meant by \"human beings are tranquil at birth, this is the nature of heaven; stirred by things, they move, this is the desire of their nature.\" Our Confucians explain it plainly; Zhuangzi speaks with biting directness. Form does not arise without the Dao; life does not become luminous without virtue—Laozi and Zhuangzi’s conception of the Dao and virtue cannot be interpreted through our Confucian lens. 荡荡 (dàngdàng) describes a vastness that cannot be commanded. Only when one suddenly emerges and suddenly moves, with the myriad things following, does one truly embody kingly virtue.)*\n\nGazing into the obscure, listening to the soundless. Within obscurity, alone they see clarity; within silence, alone they hear harmony. *(Further, they are profound yet able to grasp things; divine yet able to be precise.)* Thus, in their interaction with the myriad things, they are utterly without substance yet supply what is sought; they roam freely and seize the essential, whether great or small, long or short, near or far.",

Such is the one who embodies kingly virtue.\n\n*(I suspect the preceding passage is an interpolated forgery, for it contains two instances of \"the Master said,\" and the depth and shallowness of its meaning stand out starkly. It should be excised.)*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Water and ascended the heights of Mount Kunlun, gazing southward. Upon his return, he lost his Dark Pearl. He sent Wisdom to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Li Zhu to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Chi Gou to seek it, but it was not found. Only when he sent Xiang Wang was it recovered.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor exclaimed: *\"How extraordinary! Could it be that only Xiang Wang could retrieve it?\"*\n\n*(All this is allegory. The Dark Pearl is the Dao. \"Wisdom\" refers to the cunning; Li Zhu, also known as Li Lou, is the keen-sighted. Chi Gou represents those reviled as incompetent—opposites of the cunning. Xiang Wang, \"Formless,\" is the opposite of the keen-sighted. The passage means that neither cleverness nor sharp vision suffices to grasp the Dao. Even the dull and shameless come close, yet still fall short; only by transcending all form can it be attained.)*\n\nYao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi.\n\nYao asked Xu You: *\"Could Nie Que be fit to match Heaven and become the Son of Heaven? I would rely on Wang Ni to assess him.\"*\n\nXu You replied: *\"How perilous! The world would be in ruins. Nie Que’s nature is keen, wise, and swift—his abilities surpass others, and he even takes human governance as if it were Heaven’s mandate. With such innate gifts, if he were to receive the throne, his excesses would only grow. He scrutinizes prohibitions against transgression yet does not understand how transgressions arise. Could he match Heaven? He would ride roughshod over others, forgetting Heaven. If he matched Heaven, he would trample over people while remaining oblivious to Heaven itself. He would take one body and multiply it into countless forms; he would exalt cunning, his mind racing like fire; he would be driven by trivial affairs, bound by things, ever glancing about to meet their demands, adapting to every circumstance, yet never abiding in constancy. How could such a one match Heaven?\"*\n\n*(Nevertheless, though Nie Que is as described, one cannot generalize about people. Just as there are clans and ancestors—clans have their elders, and ancestors are revered above all—Nie Que might serve as a father to many clans, but not as the father of fathers. That is the role of the ancestor.)*\n\n*\"Order is the harbinger of chaos; facing north is the prelude to disaster; facing south is the seed of tyranny. Nie Que’s talents might make him a leader in a disordered age, yet he would not escape the calamity of serving as a minister below or the treachery of ruling as a sovereign above—like a capable minister in a well-ordered age who becomes a villain in times of chaos.\"*\n\nYao observed the land of Hua, where a border guard said: *\"Ah! A sage!\"* He offered blessings, wishing the sage long life.\n\nYao declined.\n\nThe guard wished him wealth.\n\nYao declined.\n\nThe guard wished him many sons.\n\nYao declined.\n\nThe guard said: *\"Longevity, wealth, and many sons—these are what all people desire. Why do you alone refuse them?\"*\n\nYao replied: *\"Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many affairs; longevity brings many humiliations. These three do not nurture virtue, so I decline.\"*\n\nThe guard said: *\"At first, I took you for a sage, but now you are merely a gentleman. Heaven gives life to the people and assigns them duties. If you have many sons and assign them duties, what fear remains? If you are wealthy and distribute it, what affairs remain? The sage dwells like a quail and eats like a fledgling—unseen as a bird in flight. When the world is ordered, all things flourish together; when it is disordered, one cultivates virtue in seclusion. After a thousand years, weary of the world, one ascends as an immortal, riding the white clouds to the realm of the Emperor. With the three calamities averted and the body free from harm, what humiliation remains?\"*\n\nThe guard departed, but Yao followed and asked: *\"May I inquire further?\"*\n\nThe guard said: *\"Withdraw.\"*\n\nWhen Yao ruled the world, Bo Cheng Zi Gao was enfeoffed as a lord. When Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to Yu, Bo Cheng Zi Gao resigned his lordship to till the fields. Yu went to see him and found him plowing in the wilds. Yu hastened to stand downwind and asked: *\"In the past, when Yao ruled the world, you served as a lord. When Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to me, you resigned your lordship to plow. May I ask why?\"*\n\nBo Cheng Zi Gao replied: *\"In Yao’s time, there were no rewards, yet the people were encouraged; no punishments, yet the people stood in awe.

      "translated_text": "The Master said: \"Why not fully align with the Way and let it flow freely? Do not obstruct my affairs.\"\n\nPlowing diligently without pause—this is still abandonment. In the Great Beginning, there was Nonbeing; there was no Being, no name. From the One, all things arose, yet the One itself remained formless. That by which things are born is called *virtue*; before form emerged, all principles were already present, their order latent yet unbroken—this is called *ming* (fate). Stillness in motion gives rise to things; when things attain their inherent principles, this is called *form*. When form and body preserve spirit, each possessing its own pattern, this is called *nature*. Cultivating nature returns one to *virtue*; when *virtue* reaches its utmost, it merges with the primordial. This merging is emptiness; emptiness is vastness. The clamor of beaks falls silent; when beaks fall silent, they unite with Heaven and Earth. This union is seamless, like threads woven together—appearing foolish, appearing dull. This is called *mysterious virtue*, alignment with the *Great Compliance*.\n\nIf one asks whether the Great Beginning held Being or Nonbeing, the answer is: there was no Being, nor even this name. Yet within Nonbeing, the One arose—present, though not yet manifest. This is what is meant by \"the Limitless that is the Great Ultimate.\" All things receive this to be born—this is called *virtue*. Before form emerged, all principles were complete, each with its own order, though still undifferentiated—this is called *ming* (fate). When stillness moves, things are born. Each thing attains its inherent principles—this is called *form*. When form and body preserve the primordial spirit, each possessing its own pattern, this is called *nature*—what is meant by \"each thing containing a Great Ultimate.\" Cultivating nature returns one to *virtue*; when *virtue* reaches its peak, it merges with the formless beginning. This merging is emptiness; emptiness is boundlessness, beyond self and other. All the clamoring voices of the world become one. When beaks fall silent, they unite with Heaven and Earth. Seamless, like threads woven together—appearing foolish, appearing dull. *Mysterious virtue* is profound and wondrous; the *Great Compliance* ensures not a single being or thing is out of harmony.\n\nTradition holds that the Diagram of the Great Ultimate originated with recluses—this may well be so.\n\nConfucius asked Lao Dan: \"There is a man who practices the Way as if imitating it—affirming what others deny, denying what others affirm. A debater once said: 'Disjoin hardness and whiteness as if suspending them in the sky.' If this is so, can such a man be called a sage?\"\n\nLao Dan replied: \"This is but a clerk’s skill, a craftsman’s toil—wearying the body, startling the mind. The hound trained to catch raccoons ends up exhausted; the monkey’s agility lures it from the mountains. I tell you what you cannot hear and speak of what you cannot express: those with heads and tails but no heart or ears are legion; those with form and those without form or shape—all are ultimately nonexistent. Their movements and stillness, their life and death, their rise and fall—these are not their true essence. There is a Way of governance in man: forget things, forget Heaven, and it is called 'forgetting the self.' The one who forgets the self is said to enter Heaven.\"\n\n\"The Way of governance\" refers to the Way one governs, as if imitating or dissecting it. \"Suspended\" means displayed; \"sky\" means the universe—visible as if hung in the open. The passage from \"a clerk’s skill\" to \"from the mountains\" has been explained earlier. \"Heads and tails\" means having beginnings and ends. \"No heart\" means no heart to listen; \"no ears\" means not hearing.\n\nConfucius asked Lao Dan: \"There is a man whose Way of dwelling resembles that of a sage—affirming what others deny, denying what others affirm. A skilled debater once said: 'Separate hardness and whiteness as if displaying them in the sky, clearly visible.' If this man is like that, can he be called a sage?\"\n\nLao Dan replied: \"How could such a one be a sage? Let me tell you what you cannot hear and what you cannot speak of: among what people hear, some remember things with beginnings and ends, some listen without heart, as if without ears. Among what they say, some describe many things with form, some speak of the formless and shapeless as if present before them—yet all of this is ultimately unreal, mere emptiness. Their discussions of movement and stillness, life and death, rise and fall are but deceptive words, not the true principle of how things are. Debate is so useless. There is another Way of governance in man: he forgets things, forgets Heaven. Heaven is the source of things; to forget both is to forget utterly. The world calls those who forget much 'self-forgetters.' Thus, this man is called one who forgets the self. The one who forgets the self is said to enter Heaven—meaning he becomes one with Heaven. The line 'There is a Way of governance in man' responds to the earlier 'a man who practices the Way as if imitating it,' making the meaning clear.\"\n\nJiang Lü Mian went to see Ji Che and said: \"The Lord of Lu told me: 'I request your instruction.' I declined but was not permitted. Having already advised him, I do not know if it was fitting. Allow me to present it to you. I told the Lord of Lu: 'You must practice reverence and frugality, promote those who are publicly loyal without partiality—then who among the people would dare not be harmonious?'\"\n\nJi Che laughed heartily and said: \"If this is what you said, then compared to the virtue of emperors and kings, it is like a mantis raising its arms to block a chariot—it will surely fail. Moreover, if this is so, then he places himself in danger.

      "translated_text": "When the Great Sage governs the world, he unsettles the people’s hearts, shaping them into teachings and transforming customs, eradicating their predatory impulses and fostering their solitary aspirations. It is as if their nature acts of itself, and the people know not how it comes to be. In this way, how could he be like a brother to Yao and Shun, who taught the people with deliberate methods? He desires unity in virtue, and the heart finds repose.\n\nTo dwell in lofty heights draws many to follow, and there is the peril of being unequal to the task. To unsettle the people’s hearts is to keep them from constraint. *Predatory impulses* are the inclinations to harm one another; *solitary aspirations* are the resolve of self-attainment. The phrase *\"how could he be like a brother to Yao and Shun\"* means that the Great Sage governs the world by letting things take their natural course, whereas Yao and Shun could not govern without leaving traces. Would the Great Sage deign to be a brother to Yao and Shun? *The heart finds repose* means the heart is at peace and still. When one shares virtue with the world without contrivance, the heart is at peace.\n\nZigong traveled south to Chu and, returning to Jin, passed by Hanyin.

Drawing water as if pulling, swift as boiling water overflowing—this is called a well-swing.\"\n\nThe gardener flushed with anger, his face darkening as he laughed: \"I have heard from my teacher that those who possess mechanical devices must engage in mechanical affairs, and those who engage in mechanical affairs must harbor a mechanical heart. When a mechanical heart lodges in the breast, purity and whiteness are incomplete—purity and whiteness being one’s original nature. If purity and whiteness are incomplete, the spirit’s vitality is unsettled. One whose spirit’s vitality is unsettled is not borne by the Dao. I do not fail to know of such things; I am ashamed to do them.\"\n\nZigong’s eyes dimmed with shame; he lowered his head and made no reply. After a while, the gardener said: \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I am a disciple of Confucius.\"\n\nThe gardener said: \"Are you not one of those who, with vast learning, presume to rival the sages, and with endless chatter, seek to overshadow the multitude? You strum a single string and sing mournful songs to peddle your reputation across the world! You are about to forget your spirit and qi, to ruin your body—how could you possibly govern yourself, let alone the world? Be on your way; do not hinder my work.\"\n\nZigong shrank back in dismay, his face pale. Overwhelmed with reverence, he felt ill at ease and walked thirty *li* before recovering. His disciples asked: \"Who was that man just now? Why did you change countenance and lose composure, remaining unsettled for the rest of the day?\"\n\nZigong replied: \"At first, I thought there was only one man in the world—meaning Confucius—but now I know there is another. I have heard the Master say: 'In affairs, seek what is fitting; in achievement, seek completion; expend little effort yet yield great results—this is the Way of the sage.' Yet now I see it is not so. One who holds to the Dao has virtue complete; with virtue complete, the body is whole; with the body whole, the spirit is whole. With the spirit whole, this is the Way of the sage. Entrusting one’s life to the people, moving among them without knowing one’s destination—how boundless, how perfectly pure! Entrusting my life to the people, moving among them without knowing where I go—this is merely to dwell in harmony with them, forgetting all else. How boundless, how perfectly whole! One must forget the heart that pursues profit, skill, and cunning. Such a person does not turn toward what is not his will, nor act on what is not his heart. Though the world praises him, if it aligns with his principles, he remains unmoved; though the world condemns him, if it contradicts his principles, he remains untroubled. The world’s praise or blame neither benefits nor harms him—this is what we call a person of complete virtue. I am but a man tossed by wind and waves.\"\n\nReturning to Lu, he reported this to Confucius. Confucius said: \"That man practices the arts of Hundun. Hundun refers to the Great Ultimate. He knows one thing but not two, cultivates his inner self but does not attend to externals. One who is clear and enters simplicity, who practices non-action and returns to uncarved simplicity, who embraces the spirit and wanders among the common people—were you truly startled? As for the arts of Hundun, how could you or I comprehend them?\"\n\nZhun Mang was traveling east to the Great Abyss when he encountered Yuan Feng on the shores of the Eastern Sea. Yuan Feng asked: \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To the Great Abyss.\"\n\n\"What will you do there?\"\n\n\"The Great Abyss, as a thing, receives all without filling, draws from without exhausting. I will wander there.\"\n\nYuan Feng said: \"Do you have no concern for the horizontal-eyed people? I wish to hear of sagely governance.\"\n\nZhun Mang said: \"Sagely governance? Let me speak of what it entails. Offices are established without error, talents are promoted without mistake, all circumstances are seen clearly and actions taken accordingly. One acts, and the world is transformed. With a wave of the hand or a glance, the people of the four directions all come—this is called sagely governance. Sagely governance means establishing offices and enacting policies without error, promoting talents without mistake, fully perceiving human affairs and acting accordingly. One acts with such care that no misstep is feared. I have said that when one cultivates oneself, the world is transformed. Once self-cultivation is achieved, a wave of the hand or a glance brings all people to follow.\"\n\n\"I wish to hear of the virtuous person.\"\n\nYuan Feng, hearing Zhun Mang’s words, found sagely governance not the ultimate. He asked again: \"I wish to hear of the virtuous person.\"\n\nZhun Mang said: \"The virtuous person dwells without thought, moves without calculation, harbors no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness. Within the four seas, all rejoice in shared benefit, all find peace in shared provision. He is tender as a child toward its mother, yet carefree as one who wanders and loses the Way. Wealth and resources abound, yet he does not know their source; food and drink suffice, yet he does not know their origin—this is the bearing of the virtuous person.\"\n\n\"I wish to hear of the spirit person.\"\n\nZhun Mang said: \"The supreme spirit rides the light, its form vanishing—this is called 'illuminating the vast.' After attaining the Dao, the spirit ascends and roams only in the realm of light. Looking down, its body is like withered wood or dung. This is called 'illuminating the vast,' meaning it shines through the boundless, no longer confined by form. When life is fully realized and emotions fully expressed, heaven and earth rejoice and all things dissolve. All things return to their true nature—this is called 'merging with the obscure.' To 'realize life fully' is to exhaust one’s destiny and express one’s emotions completely. As I have spoken of the spirit person’s state, so too one who exhausts the root of life and fully expresses emotions truly rejoices with heaven and earth, and all things vanish. All things return to their original nature, merging into the obscure and formless.\"\n\nMenwugui and Chizhang Manji observed the armies of King Wu.

The people are like wild deer: upright yet unaware of righteousness, loving yet unaware of benevolence, sincere yet unaware of loyalty, fitting yet unaware of trustworthiness, moving and employing one another without considering it a favor. Thus their actions leave no traces, their affairs no record.\n\nThe filial son does not flatter his parents, the loyal minister does not fawn upon his lord—this is the height of ministerial and filial excellence. When a parent’s words are affirmed and their conduct deemed good, the world calls the child unfilial; when a lord’s words are affirmed and their conduct deemed good, the world calls the minister disloyal. Yet how can one know this must be so? When the world’s so-called right is affirmed as right, and its so-called good is affirmed as good, it does not call such a one a flatterer. Is it then that the world’s standards are stricter toward kin and more reverent toward rulers?\n\nThe world deems loyal ministers and filial sons those who, when their lord or parent errs, admonish rather than flatter. Yet those who comply with and please their lord or parent are inevitably branded as flatterers, while those who comply with and please the world are not—thus one dares to admonish lord or parent but not the world. Are the world’s standards indeed stricter toward kin and more reverent toward rulers?\n\nWhen others call one a guide, one bristles with anger; when called a flatterer, one flushes with indignation. Yet all one’s life one guides others, all one’s life one flatters others—gathering crowds with polished words and elaborate similes, so that beginning and end, root and branch never align. People refuse the name of guide or flatterer, yet their conduct is nothing but lifelong flattery. They mix metaphors, embellish speech, and seek to assemble followers, yet never recognize their own actions—how can one’s own beginning and end, root and branch, not stand in mutual accusation?\n\nDraped in robes, adorned in colors, modulating one’s expression to ingratiate an age—yet never calling oneself a flatterer; joining others in debating right and wrong—yet never calling oneself one of the crowd: this is the height of folly.\n\nThis passage now turns to Shun: Shun draped his robes, and the world was governed; he displayed the five colors to adorn the five virtues, ruling with reverence from his southern-facing throne. Thus it is said: draped in robes, adorned in colors, modulating his expression. Shun thus pleased an entire age without calling himself a flatterer; he debated right and wrong with others without calling himself one of the crowd. This is the height of folly.\n\nThis speaks of Shun, yet the following text shifts to King Wu—seemingly a veiled critique, unnoticed by readers.\n\nOne who knows their own folly is not utterly foolish; one who knows their own confusion is not utterly confused.\"",

      "translated_text": "Great confusion persists unsolved for a lifetime; great folly remains unenlightened to the end. Appending \"folly\" or adding \"confusion\" to a statement—such is the rhetorical style often seen in Zhuangzi’s writing.\n\nWhen three travel together and one is confused, the destination may still be reached, for confusion is but slight; if two are confused, effort is spent in vain, for confusion prevails. Now that the whole world is confused, though I have my own aspirations, they cannot be fulfilled. Is this not lamentable?\n\nThis uses the journey as a metaphor: if three set out together toward the east, but one wishes to go west, confusion is but partial, and the east may still be reached. If two wish to go west, confusion prevails, and all labor is wasted. The analogy refers to King Wu’s campaign against Zhou, when eight hundred states pledged allegiance—thus the whole world was confused. \"I\" here is Chi Zhang Manji speaking of himself. *Qi xiang* means \"desired direction.\" Though I have my own course, it cannot be realized—is this not lamentable? This deeply grieves the affair of King Wu.\n\nGrand music does not enter the ears of the village; when the vulgar tunes *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* are played, people cackle with delight. Thus lofty speech does not lodge in the hearts of the multitude; the profound is unspoken, and common speech prevails. If two earthen jars are struck as bells, confusion arises, and the true destination is lost.\n\nNow that the whole world is confused, though I have my aspirations, how can they be awaited? This again uses music as a metaphor: ancient music does not please the common ear, but vulgar tunes bring joy. If two strike earthen jars for sound, people delight in the novelty and are led astray. The music of antiquity cannot spread—how much less so when the whole world is confused! Though I have my own course, how can it be realized? The repeated metaphors and reiterated words make the meaning all the more poignant.\n\nOld commentaries, misled by the phrase \"the destination,\" read this as a continuation of the previous passage and emend *fou zhong* to *chui zhong*, which is mistaken. Here, \"the destination is lost\" echoes the earlier \"the destination may be reached.\" The former refers to a journey; this refers to the spread of music.\n\nTo know something is unattainable yet force it is yet another confusion. Therefore, it is best to let go and not pursue it. If not pursued, with whom should one share concern?\n\nThis subtly refers to those like Boyi: abandoning the matter and not examining it, one need not share others’ sorrows. Consider the leper who gives birth at midnight, hastily fetching a light to inspect the child, anxious lest it resemble himself. This illustrates one who need not share another’s concern: the leper fears his child will be like him, thus not wishing for sameness—so why share another’s sorrow?\n\nA hundred-year-old tree, split into sacrificial vessels, adorned with blue and yellow patterns, its offcuts discarded in the ditch—compared to the vessel, the ditch-bound scrap is base, yet both have lost their original nature. Robber Zhi and the virtuous Zeng and Shi differ in conduct, yet their loss of nature is the same.\n\nMoreover, there are five ways to lose one’s nature:\n1. The five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear;\n2. The five sounds confuse the ears, making them dull;\n3. The five odors choke the nose, causing the forehead to furrow;\n4. The five flavors cloy the mouth, making it numb;\n5. Desires and aversions agitate the heart, scattering the nature.\n\nThese five are all harms to life. Yet Yang Zhu and Mo Di, striving and self-satisfied, claim to have attained the Way—this is not what I call attainment. If distress can be called attainment, then the owl in a cage may also be said to have attained it.\n\nFurthermore, desires and aversions, sounds and colors, barricade the inner self; ceremonial caps, kingfisher plumes, sashes, and long girdles constrain the outer. Internally hemmed in by barriers, externally bound by cords, one glories in being entangled yet deems it attainment. If so, then prisoners with bound arms and fingers, or tigers and leopards in cages, may also be said to have attained it.\n\n*The True Classic of Southern Florescence* concludes here with Chapter Thirteen of the received text.

They simply modeled themselves on Heaven and Earth.\nFor Heaven and Earth are what the ancients deemed greatest.\n\n(Here follows the passage from *Zhuangzi* where Confucius and Laozi converse:)\nConfucius was storing books in the Western Zhou archives when Zilu counseled: \"I have heard that the Keeper of the Archives in Zhou, a man named Lao Dan, has retired and lives at home. If you wish to store books, Master, why not seek his assistance?\"\nConfucius said: \"Very well.\"\nHe went to see Laozi, who refused. Thereupon Confucius expounded the Twelve Classics to persuade him (one account says the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*—the Six Classics—plus the Six *Weft* texts, totaling twelve; another says the *Changes*’ upper and lower canons plus the Ten Wings make twelve; another says the twelve ducal reigns of the *Spring and Autumn*. The accounts differ, and need not be rigidly adhered to).\nLaozi interrupted his discourse, saying: \"This is too prolix! I would hear the essentials.\"\nConfucius said: \"The essentials lie in benevolence and righteousness.\"\nLaozi said: \"May I ask: are benevolence and righteousness part of human nature?\"\nConfucius said: \"Indeed. The noble man who lacks benevolence cannot be perfected; without righteousness, he cannot live. Benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of man—what more is there to be done?\"\nLaozi said: \"May I ask: what are benevolence and righteousness?\"\nConfucius said: \"A joyful heart in harmony with things, universal love without partiality—this is the essence of benevolence and righteousness.\"\nLaozi said: \"Hmm! Nearly the last word! (A remark on how such talk comes too late.)\nUniversal love—is this not impractical? Without partiality—is this not itself partiality? Sir, do you wish to ensure that the world does not lose its shepherds? Then Heaven and Earth already have their constancy, the sun and moon their brightness, the stars and constellations their ranks, birds and beasts their flocks, trees and plants their uprightness.\nYou, sir, should follow virtue in your conduct, proceed by guiding and leading—this is already perfection. Why then laboriously brandish benevolence and righteousness like one beating a drum to seek a lost child?\nAh! You, sir, confuse human nature!\"\nShi Chengqi saw Laozi and asked: \"I have heard that you, sir, are a sage. I did not hesitate to travel far to seek an audience, journeying a hundred stages with calloused feet, never daring to rest. Now I observe that you are no sage. You have leftover vegetables in rat burrows yet abandon your younger sister—this is not benevolent. Before you, food is not fully consumed, yet you hoard without limit.\" (Rat burrows contain leftover scraps, yet he cannot even nourish his sister; food is not exhausted before him, yet his hoarding knows no bounds—these are all unenlightened acts.

      "translated_text": "Laozi remained silent, offering no response. The next day, Shi Chengqi sought him again and said: \"Yesterday, I reproached you, but now my heart has truly retreated. *Retreated*—meaning withdrawn, no longer reproaching or criticizing. Why is this?\" Laozi replied: \"The man of cunning wisdom and divine sagacity—I once believed myself free of such traits. *Free*—meaning departed. In the past, when you called me an ox, you named me an ox; when you called me a horse, you named me a horse. If one truly possesses the reality, yet refuses the name others give, one invites calamity anew. I submit—always submit. I do not submit because submission is due. *Submit*—meaning to yield. My submission to others is but the constant presence of a yielding heart, not merely yielding to what is worthy of submission. Even when words are unworthy, I yield.\"\n\nShi Chengqi stepped aside like a wild goose avoiding its shadow, then advanced and asked how to cultivate the self. Laozi said: \"Your countenance is haughty, your gaze piercing, your brow broad and towering, your mouth gaping wide, your demeanor rigid. You are like a horse reined in yet still straining to bolt. Though tethered, its mind ever races. To move is to restrain, to act is to trigger the crossbow’s mechanism. To observe is to scrutinize, to know is to perceive excess. All this betrays a lack of trustworthiness. Such a man at the borderlands would be called a thief.\"\n\nLaozi continued: \"As for the Dao, it is not exhausted in greatness nor neglected in smallness, thus all things are complete within it. Vast—so boundless it contains all; profound—so unfathomable it cannot be measured. Forms, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are but the dregs of spirit. Who but the Perfected Man can stabilize them? The Perfected Man—though he possesses the world, how vast is this! Yet it does not burden him. Though the world seethes and struggles, he does not join it. He discerns the unreal and does not shift with profit. He exhausts the truth of things and guards their root. Thus, he transcends heaven and earth, forsakes the myriad things, and his spirit is never constrained. He penetrates the Dao, unites with virtue, sets aside benevolence and righteousness, and treats rites and music as guests—not as masters. The heart of the Perfected Man is thus settled.\"\n\nThis passage, in the manner of Laozi’s response to Shi Chengqi’s question:\n\nThe Dao prized by the world is but texts. Texts are merely words, and words have their value. What is valued in words is their meaning, and meaning has its source. Yet the source of meaning cannot be transmitted through words, though the world clings to transmitting words through texts. Though the world prizes them, they are not truly worthy—for what they prize is not what is truly prized. Thus, what can be seen are forms and colors; what can be heard are names and sounds. Alas! The world believes forms, colors, names, and sounds suffice to grasp the truth of things. Yet if forms, colors, names, and sounds truly do not suffice, then the wise do not speak, and those who speak are not wise. How, then, could the world recognize this?\n\nDuke Huan was reading in the hall when Wheelwright Bian, carving a wheel below, set down his mallet and chisel, ascended, and asked: \"May I dare ask what words Your Grace reads?\" The Duke replied: \"The words of a sage.\" The wheelwright said: \"Is the sage still alive?\"",

Can one say that perfect benevolence is unfilial?\" Zhuangzi said: \"Not so. Perfect benevolence is lofty indeed—filial piety is hardly sufficient to describe it. This is not a statement that surpasses filial piety, but one that falls short of it. This is what is meant by perfect benevolence having no partiality. That which surpasses is contrived; that which falls short is natural.\n\nConsider one traveling south to Ying: facing north, they do not see Mount Ming—why is this? It is because they are too far from it. *Mount Ming* is the name of a northern mountain. Just as one traveling far does not see Mount Ming, so too does perfect benevolence not see filial piety. Thus it is said: Reverent filial piety is easy; loving filial piety is difficult. Loving filial piety is easy; forgetting one’s kin is difficult. Forgetting one’s kin is easy; making one’s kin forget oneself is difficult. Making one’s kin forget oneself is easy; forgetting all under heaven is difficult. Forgetting all under heaven is easy; making all under heaven forget oneself is difficult.\n\nThe virtue of perfect benevolence leaves Yao and Shun behind without effort, its beneficence extending to ten thousand generations, yet none under heaven know it—how could it merely sigh and speak of benevolence and filial piety? Perfect benevolence is such that its virtue could be compared to Yao and Shun yet not pursued, its beneficence extending to ten thousand generations while none under heaven know it—how would it deign to sigh and boast of benevolence and filial piety?\n\nFilial devotion, fraternal respect, benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and incorruptibility—these are all self-exertions that labor one’s virtue and are not worthy of praise. Thus it is said: The most noble casts aside state rank; the most wealthy casts aside state wealth; the greatest aspiration casts aside fame and reputation. Only thus does the Dao remain unchanging.\n\nBeimen Cheng asked the Yellow Emperor: \"When Your Majesty performed the music of *Xianchi* in the wilds of Dongting, I first heard it and was afraid, then heard it again and grew weary, and finally heard it and was moved. Adrift and silent, I could not find myself.\" *Adrift* describes the unsettled spirit; *silent*, the inability to speak. *Not finding oneself* means the heart could not be at ease. The Emperor said: \"You were nearly correct. I performed it with human affairs, harmonized it with Heaven, conducted it with ritual and righteousness, and established it with the Great Purity.\n\nThe perfect music first responds to human affairs, accords with the principles of Heaven, is conducted with the Five Virtues, and answers to nature—only then does it regulate the four seasons and harmonize the myriad things. The four seasons arise in succession, and the myriad things follow their birth. Now flourishing, now declining, the patterns of civil and martial order unfold. Now clear, now turbid, yin and yang harmonize, their sounds flowing luminously. When hibernating creatures first stir, I startle them with thunder. Its end has no tail, its beginning no head. Now death, now life; now collapse, now rise—ever constant and inexhaustible, yet the One cannot be awaited.\n\nThus you were afraid. The four seasons and the myriad things speak to the spontaneity of creation. Flourishing and declining, civil and martial, clear and turbid, yin and yang—these describe their rhythms. *Their sounds flowing luminously* means their sounds flow smoothly and shine brightly. This line harmonizes the preceding rhyme, embodying the purity of following nature. When hibernating creatures first stir, I startle them with thunder. Its end has no tail, its beginning no head—it arises and ceases suddenly, like the unpredictability of thunder. Now death, now life; now collapse, now rise—ever cycling without end, yet the One cannot be awaited. Read this as a continuous passage: one death is followed by one life, one collapse by one rise, endlessly circulating, yet the One cannot be delayed. One death is followed by one life, one collapse by one rise, with no pause—how can it be awaited? Beimen Cheng, hearing the music thus, felt terror.\n\nI then performed it with the harmony of yin and yang, illuminating it with the brightness of the sun and moon. Its sounds could be short or long, soft or hard, transforming uniformly without adhering to fixed patterns. In valleys, it filled valleys; in pits, it filled pits. Stopping up the gaps, I guarded my spirit, measuring by things. Its sounds were expansive, its name lofty and bright. Thus ghosts and spirits guarded their hidden realms, while the sun, moon, and stars followed their courses. I halted it at the bounded, flowed it into the boundless. You wish to ponder it but cannot know it; to gaze upon it but cannot see it; to pursue it but cannot reach it.\n\nSuddenly standing on the Dao of the four voids, leaning against a withered catalpa and chanting: the eyes exhaust what they wish to see, strength is spent in what it wishes to pursue—I cannot attain it, so be it. The form fills the emptiness, even to the point of meandering. You meandered, thus grew weary.\" Continuing the preceding discussion of yin-yang harmony, I performed it with the harmony of yin and yang, illuminating it with the brightness of the sun and moon. Though harmonious, it had distinctions—this is what is called clarity. Its sounds could be short or long, soft or hard, transforming uniformly without adhering to fixed patterns—all embodying clarity. In valleys, it filled valleys; in pits, it filled pits—its sounds were all-pervading. *Stopping up the gaps* is like stopping the ears and covering the eyes. When my music was not performed, hearing and sight guarded their spirit, following the measure of things. The sounds received were great or small, the music’s tones expansive, its name lofty and bright.",

      "translated_text": "The spirits and gods guard their hidden realms, the sun, moon, and stars follow their celestial paths—each without disorder. I halt it at the bounded, let it flow into the boundless. Sometimes halting, sometimes flowing, it has no constancy. Though you may strive to ponder it, you cannot know it; though you may gaze upon it, you cannot see it; though you may chase after it, you cannot reach it. Suddenly you stand lost amid the fourfold emptiness of the road, leaning against a withered catalpa, chanting—only to feel your vision exhausted, your strength spent. This is what is meant by \"though you wish to follow it, there is no way to do so.\" Since it cannot be attained, all you perceive is its form and image filling the void. Thus, the heart slackens and grows weary of itself.\n\nI then perform it with sounds of tirelessness, attuning it to the mandate of nature. Thus, it seems to blend and chase in profusion, like a forest of music without form; it spreads and unfurls without trailing, deep and dim without sound. It moves without direction, dwells in the obscure and unseen. Some call it death, some call it life; some call it substance, some call it glory. It flows and scatters, shifting without adhering to fixed sounds. The world doubts it and turns to the sages for verification. The sage is one who penetrates human nature and fulfills the mandate. The celestial mechanism does not unfold, yet the five offices are all complete—this is called the music of heaven. It speaks no words, yet the heart rejoices.\n\nThus, the Lord of Yan sang its praise:\n*\"Hear it, yet hear no sound;\nSee it, yet see no form.\nIt fills heaven and earth,\nEnvelops the six directions.\nYou wish to listen, yet find no point of contact—\nThus you are perplexed.\"*\n\nContinuing from the preceding discussion of weariness, I perform it with sounds of tirelessness. What is meant by tirelessness? It is attuned to the natural mandate of heaven—emerging from spontaneity, like the flowing course of heaven’s decree. Thus, its sounds seem to mingle and pursue one another in a dense profusion, growing together like a forest, rejoicing without form—this is what is called *yiru* (resonant clarity). When it scatters and arises, it exhausts itself without lingering; when it is deep and dim, it is utterly silent. Its movement has no fixed direction, its dwelling is in the profound and obscure. Some measure it and call it death, some call it life; some call it substance, some call it glory. All one sees is its flowing, scattering, and shifting, without adhering to fixed sounds. Thus, the world doubts it and examines its principles, turning to the sages for inquiry. The sage is one who understands human nature and attains the mandate. This music cannot be made by anyone but a sage.\n\nThe term *mandate* here corresponds to the earlier \"attuned to the mandate of nature.\" The celestial mechanism does not unfold—no artificial devices are employed. My offices are all complete; the governance of the five tones is fully established. The music of heaven is the spontaneous mandate itself. It speaks no words, yet the heart rejoices—its wonder cannot be captured in speech, yet the heart naturally awakens to joy.\n\nThe ode of the Lord of Yan is cited to reveal the marvel beyond sound. You seek to grasp its subtlety but find no point of contact—hence the perplexity.\n\nMusic begins with awe; awe gives rise to reverence. I follow with weariness; weariness gives rise to flight. It ends in confusion; confusion gives rise to foolishness. Foolishness gives rise to the Way, and the Way can be borne and journeyed with as one.\n\nThis concludes the three preceding sections, summarizing their ultimate return. Awe sharpens the spirit, as if haunted by ghosts and spirits—hence \"reverence.\" Weariness exhausts the heart and strength, prompting the desire to abandon it—hence \"flight.\" Confusion clouds knowledge—hence \"foolishness.\" Once foolish, one may enter the Way; once in the Way, one may ride alongside it. Thus, the discussion of music leads to the Way.\n\nThis passage resembles the performance of music in the wilds of Dongting—seemingly without beginning or end, difficult to grasp at first glance, yet upon careful examination, it has its own order. Since Confucius spoke to the Grand Music Master, even Zhuangzi, who does not merely plagiarize old words, discusses music in this way to achieve its subtlety.\n\nConfucius traveled west to Wei, and Yan Yuan asked Shi Jin (the Grand Music Master of Lu, named Jin): \"What do you think of my Master’s conduct?\"\nShi Jin replied: \"Alas! Your Master is in dire straits.\"\nYan Yuan said: \"Why?\"\nShi Jin said: \"Before a straw dog is displayed, it is kept in a fine basket, wrapped in embroidered cloth, and the priest fasts to prepare for its presentation. Once displayed, passersby trample its head and spine, and fuel-gatherers take it to burn. If one were to gather it again, place it in a fine basket, wrap it in embroidered cloth, and wander or rest beneath it, one would not only fail to dream but would surely suffer from *mi* (a condition where something enters the eye). Not only would dreams fail, but one would see omens and apparitions in the eyes. Now, your Master has taken the straw dogs of the former kings—already displayed—and leads his disciples to wander and rest beneath them. Thus, he was assaulted by the felling of a tree in Song, erased his traces in Wei, and was impoverished in Shang and Zhou—was this not like a dream? Originally, it was said one could not dream, yet now it is hastily declared, 'Was this not a dream?' Similarly, in the *Analects*, it was originally said one had not yet attained it, yet it is hastily declared, 'One fears attaining it.' He was besieged between Chen and Cai, went seven days without cooking a meal, and death and life became neighbors—was this not like *mi*? The people of Kuang mistook him for Yang Hu and besieged him, much like an apparition blinding the eyes.\n\nThe best way to travel on water is by boat, and the best way to travel on land is by cart. If, because a boat can travel on water, one seeks to push it on land, it will never move even a short distance in a lifetime. Are not past and present like water and land? Are not Zhou and Lu like boat and cart? Now, to seek to implement Zhou’s ways in Lu is like pushing a boat on land—laborious yet fruitless, and one’s person will surely suffer harm. He did not understand the transmission without fixed methods, which responds to things without exhaustion. Only by having no constant laws can one respond to the times without exhaustion.\"",

They knew the beauty of knitting brows but did not know why knitting brows was beautiful. Alas, how confined you are!\n\nConfucius, at the age of fifty-one, had still not heard the Dao. He then journeyed south to Pei to see Lao Dan. Lao Dan was a man of Chen, serving as minister in Ku County, which lay near Pei. Lao Dan said, “Have you come? I have heard that you are a worthy man of the north. Have you also attained the Dao?” Confucius replied, “I have not.” Lao Dan asked, “How have you sought it?” Confucius said, “I sought it in measures and numbers, yet after five years I had not attained it.” Lao Dan asked, “How else have you sought it?” Confucius said, “I sought it in yin and yang, yet after twelve years I had not attained it.” Lao Dan said, “Indeed. If the Dao could be offered, there would be none who would not offer it to their lord; if the Dao could be presented, there would be none who would not present it to their kin; if the Dao could be told to others, there would be none who would not tell it to their brothers; if the Dao could be given to others, there would be none who would not give it to their descendants. Yet this is not possible. Why? Because within, there is no master to abide, and without, there is no norm to proceed. That which issues from within is not received from without—thus the sage does not emerge. That which enters from without has no master within—thus the sage does not conceal. In one case, a person lacks a master within and cannot find where to abide. In another, there is no one without to affirm what is right, and thus one does not know how to proceed. Some may awaken to it spontaneously from within, yet without a teacher’s transmission, they refuse to receive instruction from without. Though the sage cannot cause this Dao to emerge from such a person, others may be guided by instruction from without, yet they abandon themselves and lack a master within. Though the sage cannot conceal this Dao within such a person, this is why the Dao cannot be sought.\n\nFame is a public vessel—one cannot take too much of it. Benevolence and righteousness are the travelers’ lodges of the former kings, where one may stay a single night but cannot dwell long. To be seen and held to many demands—if exposed and recognized, one will incur much blame and anger.\n\nThe perfected people of old borrowed the Way of benevolence and lodged in righteousness, roaming the wilds of carefree ease, feeding in the fields of simplicity, and standing in the gardens of non-transaction. Carefree ease is non-action; simplicity is easy sustenance; non-transaction is no expenditure.

      "translated_text": "Those who cling to power cannot share authority with others—grasping it brings trembling, relinquishing it brings sorrow, and they see nothing clearly, only gazing endlessly at what they cannot cease pursuing. These are the people punished by Heaven. Seeing nothing of the supreme truth of the real, they only peer ceaselessly at their own unending desires—these are the people punished by Heaven.\n\nResentment, gratitude, taking, giving, admonition, instruction, life, and death—these eight are the instruments of rectification. Only those who follow great transformation without obstruction can wield them. Thus it is said: \"Rectification is rectitude.\" If one’s heart does not accept this, the Gate of Heaven remains closed. *Great transformation* means the great process of change, that is, Heaven. These eight are the tools for rectifying the world, but only by following the natural patterns of Heaven can one use them rightly: resent when resentment is due, show gratitude when gratitude is due, take when taking is due, give when giving is due, admonish when admonition is due, instruct when instruction is due, kill when killing is due, and spare when sparing is due. Only those who do not obscure these principles can wield them. Thus it is said: \"Rectification is rectitude.\" If even a trace of self-interest intrudes, it is no longer rectitude. When the world’s people reject this principle and insist on imposing their private will, they remain utterly blind to the patterns of Heaven—like the Gate of Heaven never opening.\n\nConfucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Lao Dan said: \"When chaff gets in your eyes, heaven and earth and the four directions seem to shift places. When mosquitoes and horseflies bite your skin, you cannot sleep all night. But benevolence and righteousness are far more grievous—they agitate the heart, and no disorder is greater. You would have the world not lose its simplicity, yet you yourself follow the wind and move, gathering virtue to stand tall. Why must you act so strenuously, like one carrying a drum in search of a lost child? Displaying lost righteousness to others is like striking a drum to find a missing child.\n\nThe egret does not bathe daily to stay white, nor the crow blacken itself daily to stay black. Black and white are their natural qualities, not worth debating. The spectacle of fame and reputation is not worth expanding. When a spring dries up, fish gather on dry land, puffing moisture at each other, moistening each other with foam—better to forget each other in rivers and lakes.\"\n\nConfucius visited Lao Dan and returned, silent for three days. His disciples asked: \"Master, when you saw Lao Dan, what correction did you seek?\" Confucius said: \"Only now have I seen the dragon. The dragon coalesces into ritual, disperses into pattern, rides the clouds and qi, and nourishes itself in yin and yang. My mouth gaped open, unable to close—what correction could I offer Lao Dan?\"\n\nZigong said: \"Then are there truly people who dwell like corpses yet manifest like dragons, thunder in voice yet plumb the depths in silence, moving like heaven and earth? Might I witness such a one?\" He then spoke of Confucius’ reputation to Lao Dan. Lao Dan was sitting in the hall and responded faintly: \"My years advance and depart—what warning do you bring me?\"\n\nZigong said: \"The governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors differed, yet their renown was the same. Why do you alone consider them not sages?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Young man, come closer. Why do you say they differed?\" Zigong replied: \"Yao passed the throne to Shun, Shun to Yu. Yu relied on labor, Tang on force; King Wen submitted to Zhou without daring to oppose, while King Wu opposed Zhou without submitting. Thus I say they differed.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Young man, come closer, and I will tell you of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors’ governance of the world. The Yellow Emperor’s rule made the people’s hearts unified—when someone’s parent died and they did not weep, none criticized them. Yao’s rule made the people’s hearts affectionate—when someone shortened mourning for a parent, none criticized them. Shun’s rule made the people’s hearts competitive—pregnant women gave birth at ten months, children spoke at five months, and before they could even crawl, people began to distinguish themselves. Yu’s rule made the people’s hearts change—each had their own intentions, and weapons had their own justifications. Killing bandits was not considered killing people. Each made their own kind, and the world was thus divided. The world was greatly alarmed, and the Confucians and Mohists arose. Their beginnings had order, yet now even women speak of it—what can be said?\n\nWhen someone shortened mourning for a parent, they reduced the five degrees of mourning from the highest. *People began to distinguish themselves* means that when the time came, it was natural; to do so prematurely was to impose human will on Heaven. *Weapons had their justifications* means that warfare became a matter of course. *Killing bandits was not considered killing* means that killing bandits was not yet killing—only killing in wars over land and cities was called killing. *Each made their own kind* means that originally, all under Heaven were one undifferentiated whole; now they divided into kinds, and this was called the world. *Their beginnings had order, yet now even women speak of it* means that the institution of marriage rites was meant to establish human order, yet now when women marry, the proper human relations are corrupted.\n\nI tell you: the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors’ governance of the world was called *governance*, yet no disorder was greater. The institutions of the Three Sovereigns obscured the brightness of sun and moon above, estranged the essence of mountains and rivers below, and disrupted the operations of the four seasons in between. Their wisdom was as cruel as the sting of a scorpion’s tail or a venomous snake’s fang. None could preserve the naturalness of their lives, yet they still called themselves sages—is this not shameful? Truly, it is shameless.\"\n\nZigong stood uneasily, shifting his feet. Confucius said to Lao Dan: \"I have studied the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn*—the Six Classics—for a long time, and thought I thoroughly understood their principles. I have sought audience with seventy-two rulers, expounding the Way of the former kings and clarifying the traces of the Zhou and Shao, yet not one ruler took up my words.\"",

      "translated_text": "\"The application—how extreme it is! Is it truly so difficult to persuade rulers, or is the Dao so hard to illuminate?\"\n\nLao Dan said, \"Fortunate indeed that you have not encountered a ruler of a well-ordered age. The Six Classics are but the worn traces of the former kings. Traces are what the footwear leaves behind, yet are traces the footwear itself? When white egrets gaze at one another, their pupils do not move, yet the wind of transformation stirs; when the male cries upon the upwind, the female responds from downwind, and the wind of transformation stirs. Each becomes its own male or female, thus the wind of transformation arises. Nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, and the Dao cannot be obstructed. If one attains the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be; if one loses it, there is nothing that can be.\"\n\nBefore three months had passed, Confucius sought audience again, saying, \"I have grasped it! Crows and magpies nurture their young, fish coat their eggs with foam, and wasps transform grubs—each follows its own transformation. Yet when a younger brother is born, the elder weeps.\"\n\n\"For too long, I have not acted as others act. If I do not transform with others, how can I transform them?\"\n\nLao Dan said, \"Good. You have grasped it. Crows and magpies raising their chicks is the constant principle of things. Fish coating their eggs with foam need not be like crows and magpies. As for wasps carrying grubs and transforming them, this is yet again not like fish. Observing their transformations, which is real? Which is false? Yet when humans bear children, they cling desperately to kinship, unaware that love grows distorted with age and rank. Thus, an elder brother cannot find peace when a younger brother is born—even creatures are not so foolish. That single word 'weeps' is deeply poignant.

      "translated_text": "**Outer Chapters: Autumn Floods**\n\nWhen the autumn floods came, the hundred rivers poured into the Yellow River. The surging currents swelled so vast that between its banks and isles, oxen and horses could not be distinguished. The turbid flow obscured all—so distant were the shores that sight failed.\n\nThen the River Lord rejoiced, exulting that all the world’s beauty was his alone. Following the current eastward, he reached the Northern Sea. Gazing east, he saw no end to the waters. Thereupon, the River Lord turned his face in dismay, looked toward Ruo with a sigh, and said:\n\n\"There is a rustic saying: *'Hearing a hundred truths, one thinks none surpasses oneself.'* That is I. I once heard men belittle Confucius’ learning and mock Boyi’s righteousness, and I did not believe them. Now that I behold the boundlessness of your realm, had I not come to your gate, I would have been in peril—forever ridiculed by those of great understanding.\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea replied: \"A frog in a well cannot speak of the sea, for it is confined by its hollow. A summer insect cannot speak of ice, for it is bound by its season. A narrow scholar cannot speak of the Dao, for he is shackled by his teachings. Now that you have emerged from your banks and beheld the great sea, you know your own insignificance—only then can you be spoken with of great principles.\n\nOf all the waters under heaven, none is greater than the sea. The ten thousand rivers flow into it, yet it never fills, though none knows when they cease. The Tail Pit drains it, yet it never empties, though none knows when it ends. Unchanged by spring or autumn, unmoved by flood or drought, its measure surpasses the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow River beyond all reckoning. Yet I have never prided myself on this, for I compare my form to heaven and earth, and receive my qi from yin and yang. I stand between heaven and earth like a pebble or twig upon a great mountain. Aware of my own smallness, how could I boast?\n\nConsider the Four Seas within heaven and earth—are they not like a crevice in a marsh? Consider the Central States within the seas—are they not like a grain of millet in a granary? We number things by the tens of thousands, yet humanity is but one among them. All the people of the Nine Provinces, where grain is grown and boats and carts traverse, are but one among them. Compared to the ten thousand things, is this not like the tip of a hair upon a horse’s body?\n\nThe Five Emperors’ succession, the Three Kings’ strife, the benevolent men’s worries, the devoted scholars’ toils—all are encompassed herein. Boyi renounced it to gain fame; Confucius discoursed on it to display his erudition. Their self-importance—was it not like your former pride in your waters?\"\n\nThe River Lord said, \"Then may I esteem heaven and earth as great and the tip of a hair as small?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said, \"No. Things have no fixed measure, time no ceasing, divisions no constancy, beginnings and ends no permanence. Thus, the man of great wisdom observes near and far, so that the small does not seem few, nor the great many—for he knows measure is boundless. He verifies past and present, so that the distant does not weary him, nor the near make him strain—for he knows time has no end. He examines fullness and emptiness, so that gain does not elate him, nor loss grieve him—for he knows divisions have no constancy. He understands the level path, so that life does not delight him, nor death afflict him—for he knows beginnings and ends have no permanence.\n\nWhat a man knows is less than what he does not know; the time of his life is less than the time before his birth.\"",

Where do distinctions of small and great arise?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea replied, \"Viewed through the Dao, things have no noble or base. Viewed through things themselves, each esteems itself and deems others base. Viewed through custom, noble and base do not lie within oneself.\n\nViewed through differentiation: if one magnifies what is great in each, then nothing in the world is not great; if one diminishes what is small in each, then nothing in the world is not small. Knowing that heaven and earth are but a grain of millet, and that the tip of a hair is a mountain—then the distinctions of measurement become apparent.\n\nViewed through function: if one affirms what each possesses, then nothing in the world does not possess; if one negates what each lacks, then nothing in the world does not lack. Knowing that east and west are opposites yet cannot be without each other—then the divisions of function are settled.\n\nViewed through inclination: if one affirms what each affirms, then nothing in the world is not affirmed; if one negates what each negates, then nothing in the world is not negated. Knowing that Yao and Jie each affirmed their own ways and negated the other—then the inclinations of conduct become apparent.\n\nIn ancient times, Yao and Shun yielded the throne and became emperors; Zhi and Kuai yielded the throne and perished. Tang and Wu fought and became kings; the Duke of Bai fought and was destroyed. From this, we see that the rites of contention and yielding, the conduct of Yao and Jie, noble and base have their times—these cannot be taken as constant.\n\nA beam and a pillar are the same, yet one can batter down a city wall while the other cannot plug a hole—this speaks of differing implements. The fine steeds Qi Ji and Hua Liu can gallop a thousand *li* in a day, yet they cannot catch mice as well as a wildcat—this speaks of differing skills. The owl can seize fleas at night and discern the tip of a hair, yet in daylight it stares and cannot see a mountain—this speaks of differing natures.\n\nThus it is said: Should one take 'this' as the standard and reject 'not-this,' or take order as the standard and reject disorder? This is to fail to understand the principles of heaven and earth and the conditions of the myriad things. It is like taking heaven as the standard and rejecting earth, or taking yin as the standard and rejecting yang—its impossibility is clear. Yet if one still insists on speaking without ceasing, one is either foolish or deceitful.\n\nThe abdications of emperors and kings differed; the successions of the Three Dynasties differed. Those who go against their times and defy customs are called usurpers; those who accord with their times and follow customs are called righteous men.\n\nSilent, O Lord of the River—how could you know the gate of noble and base, the house of small and great?\"\n\nThe Lord of the River said, \"Then what should I do? What should I not do? How should I determine what to accept or reject, what to pursue or abandon? What am I to do in the end?\"",

      "translated_text": "The Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"From the perspective of the Dao, what is noble and what is base? This is called 'reversed extension.' If one clings to rigid intentions, one greatly obstructs the Dao. What is few and what is many? This is called 'reciprocal bestowal.' If one acts with singular focus, one deviates from the Dao.\n\nMajestic as a state with its ruler—it grants no private virtue. Reverent as a sacrifice with its altar—it confers no private blessing. Boundless as the four directions without end—it has no boundaries. Embracing the myriad things, who bears them up? This is called 'without fixed direction.'\n\nThe myriad things are equal; what is short and what is long? The Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and life, yet do not rely on their completion. Now empty, now full, they do not abide in their forms. Years cannot be lifted; time cannot be halted. Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness—when one ends, another begins. This is how we speak of the great principles and discuss the patterns of the myriad things.\n\nThings come into being as if galloping, as if racing. No movement without change, no moment without shift. What is to be done? What is not to be done? They will naturally transform of themselves.\n\n'Extension' means to draw out and lengthen. From the perspective of the Dao, there is fundamentally no nobility or baseness. If one takes nobility and baseness as opposites and extends them, one knows not how many degrees they span. From the standpoint of dukes and ministers, dukes are noble and ministers base; from the standpoint of ministers and grand masters, ministers are noble and grand masters base. Thus it is said: without nobility, without baseness—this is called 'reversed extension.' If one clings to one’s intentions, insisting that this is noble and that is base, one obstructs the Dao.\n\n'Reciprocal bestowal' is repayment. Those who repay others’ bestowals must calculate what is more and what is less. If one acts with singular focus, determining what is more and what is less to repay, one deviates from the Dao.\n\n'Reverent' here is akin to Mencius’s 'contented.' 'Embracing the myriad things, who bears them up?' speaks of loving all things without perceiving the merit of their support.\n\nThe Lord of the River said: \"Then what is noble about the Dao?\"\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"Those who know the Dao must comprehend its principles; those who comprehend its principles must understand its adaptability; those who understand its adaptability do not allow things to harm themselves.\n\nThe utmost in virtue—fire cannot burn them, water cannot drown them, cold and heat cannot harm them, birds and beasts cannot injure them. This does not mean they slight these things, but that they discern safety and danger, remain tranquil amid fortune and misfortune, are cautious in approach and retreat, and thus nothing can harm them. Thus it is said: Heaven is within, man is without; virtue resides in Heaven.\n\nKnow that human conduct is rooted in Heaven, positioned in attainment, and moves in accord with the turning of hooves—bending and stretching, returning to the essential and speaking of the ultimate.\"\n\nThe Lord of the River said: \"What is Heaven? What is man?\"\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"Oxen and horses having four legs is called Heaven; bridling a horse’s head, piercing an ox’s nose is called man. Thus it is said: Do not let man obliterate Heaven, do not let the artificial obliterate fate, do not let gain be sacrificed for reputation.

Now that we see our error, we beg leave to withdraw.\"\n\nGongsun Long questioned Wei Mou, saying: \"In my youth, I studied the Way of the former kings; in maturity, I mastered the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I harmonized sameness and difference, separated hardness and whiteness; affirmed the untrue, negated the possible—baffling the wisdom of the hundred schools, exhausting the eloquence of all disputants. I took myself for one of perfect understanding. Yet now I hear the words of Zhuangzi, and feel only bewildered estrangement. Do I fall short in debate? Or do I simply lack his depth of insight? Now my beak hangs open—I dare ask: what is the method?\"\n\nPrince Mou leaned against his desk, sighed deeply, looked to the heavens, and laughed: \"Have you never heard of the frog in the shallow well? It said to the turtle of the Eastern Sea: 'How joyful I am! I leap and prance upon the well’s railing, rest upon the broken bricks of its walls. When I plunge into the water, it supports my armpits and cradles my chin; when I trample the mud, it swallows my feet and ankles. I turn to look at the shrimp, crabs, and tadpoles—none can match me. Moreover, to command the waters of this single ravine and straddle the joys of this shallow well—what more could one desire? Why not come and see for yourself?'\n\nThe turtle of the Eastern Sea had not yet set its left foot inside when its right knee was already pinned. It retreated in hesitation and told the sea: 'A distance of a thousand *li* cannot convey its vastness; a height of a thousand *ren* cannot plumb its depths. In the time of Yu, nine years out of ten saw floods, yet the waters did not increase; in the time of Tang, seven years out of eight saw drought, yet the shores did not diminish. Unchanged by the passage of moments or ages, unmoved by the ebb and flow of quantity—this is the great joy of the Eastern Sea.'\n\nWhen the frog in the shallow well heard this, it was struck dumb with astonishment, its gaze wandering in dismay, utterly lost. Now, if you cannot even discern the bounds of right and wrong, yet still wish to examine Zhuangzi’s words, it is like making a mosquito bear a mountain or a millipede race across a river—surely beyond your strength. And if you grasp not the subtleties of his discourse, yet seek only momentary advantage, are you not the frog in the shallow well?\n\nMoreover, he treads the Yellow Springs and ascends the Great Vast, unbound by south or north, released in all four directions, submerged in the unfathomable; unbound by east or west, beginning in the dark and obscure, returning to the Great Thoroughfare. Yet you would measure him with narrow scrutiny, seek him with argument—is this not like gazing at the sky through a tube or pointing at the earth with an awl? Is it not petty? Begone!\n\nHave you not heard of the young man from Shouling who went to Handan to learn its walk? Before mastering the state’s skill, he forgot his old gait and could only crawl home. If you do not leave now, you will forget your former ways and lose your craft.\"\n\nGongsun Long’s mouth gaped open, his tongue lifted and would not descend; he fled in haste.\n\nZhuangzi was fishing in the Pu River when the King of Chu sent two ministers to approach him first, saying: \"I wish to trouble you with the affairs of my realm.\"\n\nZhuangzi held his rod and did not turn, saying: \"I have heard that in Chu there is a sacred tortoise, dead for three thousand years. The king keeps it wrapped in silk and stored in a casket in his ancestral temple. Would this tortoise rather have died to leave its bones venerated, or lived to drag its tail through the mud?\"\n\nThe two ministers said: \"It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Go away. I will drag my tail through the mud.\"\n\nWhen Huizi was prime minister of Liang, Zhuangzi went to visit him. Someone told Huizi: \"Zhuangzi is coming to replace you as minister.\" Huizi grew alarmed and searched the state for three days and three nights.\n\nZhuangzi went to see him and said: \"In the south there is a bird called the *yuanchu*—do you know it? The *yuanchu* sets out from the Southern Sea and flies to the Northern Sea; it alights only on the *wutong* tree, eats only bamboo fruit, and drinks only sweet spring water. Then a *chi* hawk, clutching a rotten rat, saw the *yuanchu* pass overhead and looked up, crying: '*Ha!*' Now do you mean to frighten me with your state of Liang?\"\n\nZhuangzi and Huizi strolled upon the bridge over the Hao River. Zhuangzi said: \"The *tiao* fish swim leisurely—this is the joy of fish.\"\n\nHuizi said: \"You are not a fish—how do you know their joy?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"You are not me—how do you know I do not know the joy of fish?\"\n\nHuizi said: \"I am not you, so of course I do not know you; but you are certainly not a fish, so your ignorance of the fish’s joy is complete.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Let us return to the beginning. When you said, 'How do you know the joy of fish?' you already knew I knew it, yet you asked me. I know it from here, above the Hao.\"\n\nHuizi said: \"As you put it, I am not you, so of course I do not know you. But you are certainly not a fish, so your ignorance of the fish’s joy is complete. That you and I are both human is evident. You and the fish are different kinds—your complete lack of mutual understanding is clear.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Let us return to the beginning. Originally, we spoke only of the joy of fish, but then came the debate over knowledge. Now, let us follow the original thread. When you said, 'How do you know the joy of fish?' you already knew I knew it, yet you asked me deliberately. Now, as for how I know the joy of fish—I know it from here, above the Hao.

      "translated_text": "**Outer Chapters: Supreme Joy**\n\nIs there in the world a supreme joy, or is there none? Are there means to preserve life, or are there none? What should one do now, and what rely upon? What avoid, and where abide? What pursue, and what forsake? What find joy in, and what detest?\n\nWhat the world honors are wealth, nobility, long life, and goodness; what it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful sights, and sweet sounds. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and wickedness; what it finds bitter are the body denied comfort, the mouth denied rich flavors, the form denied fine garments, the eyes denied beautiful sights, and the ears denied sweet sounds. If these are not attained, one is gripped by great sorrow and fear—how foolishly this treats the body!\n\nThe wealthy exhaust themselves with toil, amassing wealth they cannot fully use—how estranged this is from the body. The noble pass days and nights in ceaseless calculation, weighing good and ill—how distant this is from the body. As for human life, it is born with sorrow. The long-lived grow dull and muddled, enduring long sorrow without death—what agony this is! How far removed from the body!\n\nThe steadfast man is praised by the world for his goodness, yet it is not enough to preserve his life. Do I know whether goodness is truly good? Or truly not good? If we deem it good, it is not enough to preserve life; if we deem it not good, it is enough to preserve others. It is said: \"When loyal remonstrance is unheeded, crouch low and follow—do not contend.\" Thus when Wu Zixu contended, his body was destroyed; had he not contended, his name would not have endured. Is there truly goodness, or is there none?\n\nAs for what the vulgar do and delight in, do I know whether their joy is truly joy? Or truly not joy? I observe that what the vulgar delight in is the clamor of the crowd, rushing together in a clanging throng as if they cannot help themselves. Yet all call it joy—do I find it joyful? Or do I not? I do not know whether it is truly joy or not. Is there truly joy, or is there none?\n\nI take non-action as true joy, yet this is what the vulgar find most bitter. Thus it is said: \"Supreme joy is no joy; supreme praise is no praise.\" The right and wrong of the world cannot truly be settled. Nevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong. Supreme joy preserves life—only non-action comes close to this.\n\nLet me try to speak of it: Heaven is clear through non-action; Earth is tranquil through non-action. Thus when the two non-actions combine, the myriad things are transformed. Vague and indistinct, from whence do they emerge? Indistinct and vague, without form do they appear? The ten thousand things, teeming and thriving, all grow from non-action. Thus it is said: \"Heaven and Earth act through non-action, yet there is nothing they do not do.\" Who among men can attain non-action?\n\nWhen Zhuangzi’s wife died, Huizi came to offer condolences. Zhuangzi was squatting with legs spread, drumming on a basin and singing. Huizi said: \"To live with someone, raise a child to adulthood, and grow old together—if upon her death you do not weep, it would be enough. But to drum on a basin and sing—is this not excessive?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Not so. When she first died, how could I alone not feel grief? Yet I examined her beginning and found she was originally without life. Not only without life, but originally without form; not only without form, but originally without *qi*. Amidst the vague and indistinct, there was transformation, and *qi* arose; the *qi* transformed and form arose; form transformed and life arose. Now it has transformed again into death. This is like the procession of the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer. She now lies peacefully in the great chamber, and if I were to wail and weep after her, I would consider myself ignorant of fate. Thus I stopped.\"\n\nZhilishu and Gujieshu were observing the mound of Mingbo, the ruins of Kunlun, where the Yellow Emperor once dwelled. Suddenly, a willow sprouted from Gujieshu’s left elbow, and he was startled and dismayed. Zhilishu said: \"Do you detest it?\"\n\nGujieshu replied: \"No—why should I detest it? Life is but a temporary borrowing. What borrows and gives rise to life is but dust and grime. Death and life are like day and night. Moreover, you and I observe transformation, and transformation has reached me—why should I detest it?\"\n\nMingbo is a term for the dead, like the \"Lord of the Dark\" in the *Wen Xuan*. The mound of Mingbo is a burial ground, located in the ruins of Kunlun. Kunlun has five cities and twelve towers, the abode of immortals. The Yellow Emperor was an ancient ruler who attained the Dao and ascended as an immortal. These words express sorrowful reminiscence: this man dwells in the realm of immortals yet cannot, like the Yellow Emperor, cultivate immortality and thus faces death.\n\nThe willow refers to the funeral bier. In the *Tan Gong*, the Zhou people placed *sha* on the walls. The commentary states: \"The wall is the *liu* covering.\" The *Zhengyi* says: \"The wall that screens the bier is like a wall screening a house, hence the screening object is called a wall. The wall is the *liu*.\" The *Feng Ren* commentary: \"*Liu* means gathering—the gathering of all adornments.\" Zhilishu and Gujieshu were observing among the mounds and ruins of the burial ground when, by the power of their thoughts, a willow for screening the bier suddenly sprouted from Gujieshu’s left elbow. An ominous sign—he was about to die. Thus he was startled and dismayed.\n\nZhilishu, though dismayed, asked Gujieshu: \"Do you detest it?\" Gujieshu replied: \"No—why should I detest it? What has life is but a temporary borrowing. This is what is meant by the four great elements provisionally combining. Since it is but a borrowing that gives rise to life, it is no more than dust and grime gathering together.\"",

      "translated_text": "\"Why cling or struggle? Thus he spoke: life and death are but day and night—this is the constant principle of the Dao, not worth alarm or dread. Life is but a temporary borrowing, and in this discourse on human life and death, the character for 'life' (*sheng*) does not again adhere to the earlier instance—here, it refers to the 'growth' (*sheng*) on his left elbow. Moreover, you and I observe transformation, and transformation has now reached us. Transformation means death.\n\nMencius said: *'Among those who face transformation, let no soil cling to the skin.'* This means that you and I came to the burial grounds to observe others' deaths, yet witnessed this ominous sign—death was about to reach us. If all men must die, then I too must die. Why should I detest it?\"\n\nSome mistakenly take *liu* (柳) to mean the willow tree, but this misinterprets the passage’s meaning.\n\nWhen Zhuangzi traveled to Chu, he saw an empty skull, bleached and still retaining form. He struck it with his horsewhip and questioned it: \"Did you, sir, covet life and lose the Way, bringing this upon yourself? Or did you suffer the fall of a state or the execution of the axe? Or did you commit some shameful deed, bringing disgrace upon your parents, wife, and children? Or did you endure the miseries of cold and hunger? Or did your years simply come to this end?\"\n\nHaving finished speaking, he took the skull as a pillow and lay down. At midnight, the skull appeared in a dream and said: \"Your words resemble those of a sophist. All you have spoken of are the burdens of the living—death knows none of these. Would you hear the truth of death?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Yes.\"\n\nThe skull replied: \"In death, there is no ruler above nor minister below, nor the affairs of the four seasons. At ease, one takes heaven and earth as spring and autumn. Even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass it.\"\n\nZhuangzi, unconvinced, said: \"If I had the Controller of Fate restore your form, giving you bones, flesh, and skin, and returning you to your parents, wife, children, neighbors, and acquaintances—would you desire this?\"\n\nThe skull frowned deeply and said: \"How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south to return to the toils of the human world?\"\n\nWhen Yan Hui traveled east to Qi, Confucius wore a troubled expression. Zigong rose from his mat and asked: \"May I dare ask why, when Yan Hui went east to Qi, you bear such a worried look?\"\n\nConfucius replied: \"Excellent question. Long ago, Guanzi spoke words I deeply admired: *'A small sack cannot hold a large object; a short rope cannot draw from the deep.'* Such is the way of fate—it has its completion, and form has its proper place. Neither can be diminished or augmented. I fear that Yan Hui will speak to the Marquis of Qi of the Ways of Yao, Shun, and the Yellow Emperor, and further cite the words of Suiren and Shennong. The marquis will search within himself and find nothing, and finding nothing, he will be perplexed. Perplexity in a man leads to death.\n\nHave you not heard the tale? Once, a seabird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu received it with ceremony, feasted it in the ancestral temple, performed the *Nine Shao* as music, and prepared a grand sacrifice as its meal. The bird, however, grew dazed and sorrowful, dared not eat a single morsel, nor drink a single cup, and died after three days. This was nourishing the bird as one nourishes oneself, not as a bird ought to be nourished. To nourish a bird as a bird, one should let it roost in deep forests, roam open plains, float upon rivers and lakes, feed on minnows and eels, follow its flock in flight, and rest at ease. It detests the clamor of human speech—why subject it to such clamor?\n\nWhen the music of *Xianchi* and *Nine Shao* was played in the wilds of Dongting, birds heard it and flew away, beasts heard it and fled, fish heard it and dove deep, while men, upon hearing it, gathered to listen. Fish live in water and thrive, yet men drown in it. Their natures differ, and so do their likes and dislikes. Thus the sages of old did not impose a single standard of ability nor demand uniformity in affairs. Names were confined to reality, and principles were set according to what was fitting—this is called 'orderly coherence and sustained good fortune.'\"\n\nLiezi was traveling when he stopped to eat by the roadside. From the *Liezi*: The character *cong* (从) below has *zhe* (者), and below *zhi* (指) has *gu* (顾). He said to his disciples, \"Bai Feng...\"",

      "translated_text": "Upon seeing a century-old skull, he plucked a stalk of mugwort and pointed at it, saying: \"Only you and I know that you have never died, nor have I ever been born. Are you truly nourished? Am I truly joyful? Seeds contain *qi*—when they encounter water, they become *jue* (絶); at the border of water and soil, they become the raiment of frogs and clams. Born on mounds, they become *lingxi* (陵舄); when *lingxi* finds damp shade, it becomes *wuzu* (乌足); the root of *wuzu* becomes *qicao* (蛴螬), while its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies, in turn, transform into insects, born beneath the hearth, their form like a cast-off skin, named *quduo* (鸲掇). After a thousand days, *quduo* becomes a bird called *ganyugu* (乾余骨). The foam of *ganyugu* becomes *simi* (斯弥), and *simi* becomes *shixi* (食酰). *Yilu* (颐辂) arises from *shixi*, *huangkuang* (黄軦) from *jiuyou* (九猷), *maorui* (瞀芮) from rotten grubs, *yangxi* (羊奚) from withered bamboo, old bamboo gives birth to *qingning* (青宁), *qingning* to *cheng* (程), *cheng* to horses, horses to humans—and humans, in turn, return to the *mechanism*. All things emerge from the *mechanism* and return to the *mechanism*. In life, they depend on nourishment; in death, they bear no burden—yet still, we fear. If you have never died and I have never been born, how can we know that you are not nourished or that I am not joyful?\n\n(For the passage beginning \"Seeds contain *qi*,\" the meaning is not entirely clear; here, only what can be understood is excerpted. *Jue* (□) is the ancient form of *jue* (絶). When earth reaches water, it is cut off—yet even there, things are born. At the intersection of water and soil, they become the raiment of frogs and clams. The raiment of frogs and clams is *shuixi* (水舄), the aquatic variety—what the *Book of Songs* calls \"gathering the *xu* (藚),\" referring to frogs and clams, which use it as their covering. Born on mounds, it becomes *lingxi* (陵舄), what the *Book of Songs* calls *fuyi* (芣苡), commonly known as *cheqian* grass. The same thing takes different forms in water and on land. *Shixi* (食酰) is the midge. *Qingning* (青宁) is the bamboo-root grub. An old man once said he saw a worm over five inches long, with another inch or so still attached—was this not the bamboo-root grub before its transformation, the so-called *qingning*? While staying in Anxiang, I saw a white moth fly into a lamp, and suddenly, one after another appeared behind it—not from birth, but from empty transformation. I also saw in Dongting Lake a mountain called Mingshan, its peak crowned with Yu’s Temple and many households. Every late spring, *quchun* (□鹑) swarm the temple and homes, swept up with bamboo brooms and pickled into vinegar. Merchants pay in advance, and at harvest, some remain half-transformed, still resembling mice—this is what the *Monthly Ordinances* calls \"field mice turning into *ru* (鴽).\" Observing this, how can one doubt the boundless transformations of heaven and earth simply because they lie beyond our senses?\n\nHorses give birth to humans, and humans return to the *mechanism*—how is this different from the Buddhist doctrine of reincarnation? Yet the Buddhist account is rigid: if one did evil in a past life, one may be reborn as a dog or horse, and only after exhausting one’s karma does one return to human form. What evidence supports this? Zhuangzi’s version is more fluid: all things emerge from the *mechanism* and return to the *mechanism*. The *mechanism* is where *qi* moves. To emerge from it is birth; to return to it is death. Between heaven and earth, there is only *yin* and *yang qi*, which generate the myriad things. In death, *yang qi* returns to heaven and *yin qi* to earth—yet this *qi* never leaves the realm of heaven and earth. Tomorrow, it will generate things anew, just as before, for it is merely *yin* and *yang qi* at work. One must not mistake a dead horse for a living person, or a dead person for a living horse.\n\nFrom *Master Zhu’s Recorded Sayings*: Zhang Hengqu said, \"When form dissolves, it returns to the origin to become human again. The thing we receive at birth, upon death, returns to the great origin. Then, from within, it is drawn out anew—this is most evident in human birth. If we followed the Buddhist account, heaven and earth would have to contain countless separate clusters of *qi*, each cycling through birth and death, entangled without end—how could this align with the workings of creation?\"\n\nFrom the *Brush Notes*: The people of Yanzhou still call tigers and leopards *cheng* (程), meaning \"worm.\" *The Authentic Scripture of Southern Florescence*, following the original text of Chapter Seventeen (the character *zhu* (诸) was emended to *shi* (视) in common editions).",

      "translated_text": "**From the Eighteenth Scroll of the *Authentic Scripture of Southern Florescence*, Following the Original Text**\n*(Recorded by Lu Ling’s Bamboo Peak Scholar Luo Miandao; collated by his disciple Peng Xiang)*\n\n**Outer Chapters: \"Attaining Life\"**\n\nOne who attains the essence of life does not strive for what is not essential to life.\n*\"Not essential\"*—as in the *Analects*: \"There is no need for this.\"\nThis speaks of such uselessness.\n\nOne who attains the essence of fate does not strive for what knowledge cannot alter.\n\nTo nourish the form, one must first attend to external things—yet there are cases where things are abundant while the form remains unnourished.\nLife necessarily begins with form inseparable—yet there are cases where form remains intact while life perishes.\nLife’s coming cannot be refused; its going cannot be halted.\nHow lamentable!\n\nThe world believes that nourishing the form suffices to preserve life—yet if nourishing the form truly does not suffice to preserve life, then what in this world is worth doing?\nThough it may not suffice, one cannot but do it—such is the inescapable burden.\nOne cannot escape having form.\n\nTo escape the burden of form, nothing surpasses abandoning the world.\nAbandoning the world means freedom from entanglements; freedom from entanglements means true equilibrium; true equilibrium means alternating renewal with that which gives life.\n*That*—the Creator.\nThe Creator gives me life, which must end in death—yet if I can preserve this life, I alternate renewal with the Creator.\nIn such alternation lies the subtlest essence.\n\nWhy abandon affairs? Why forsake life?\nAbandoning affairs spares the form from labor; forsaking life preserves the essence from depletion.\nWhen form is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven.\nHeaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things:\nUnited, they form a body; dispersed, they become a beginning.\nWhen form and essence remain undiminished, this is called *shifting*.\nEssence refined to its utmost returns to assist Heaven.\n*Heaven*—here rhyming with *tian*.\n*Shifting*—referring to the \"alternation\" above.\nThis means one can alternate with it.\n\nLife originally possesses this essence, yet worldly affairs nearly exhaust it.\nNow, by alternating renewal, one regains this essence—what gave me this life was Heaven.\nIf I, in turn, can preserve this life with Heaven, this is *assisting Heaven*.\n\nZi Liezi asked Guan Yin: \"The perfected person walks underwater without obstruction, treads fire without heat, moves above the myriad things without fear. How does one reach such a state?\"\nGuan Yin replied: \"This is the preservation of pure *qi*, not the realm of cunning, skill, or boldness. Sit, and I will tell you:\nAll things with appearance, form, sound, or color are merely *things*—how can one thing surpass another?\nWhat suffices to transcend them? Only *formlessness*.\nFormlessness is the origin of creation and the end of transformation.\nOne who attains this and exhausts it—how can mere things constrain them?\nThey dwell within the measure of restraint, conceal themselves in the traceless principle, and roam through the beginning and end of the myriad things.\nUnifying their nature, nurturing their *qi*, harmonizing their virtue, they commune with the source of all things.\nSuch a one’s Heavenly endowment remains whole, their spirit unbroken—how could things intrude?\n\nThe drunken man who falls from a cart, though swiftly, does not die.\nHis bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit remains whole.\nHe neither knows he is riding nor knows he has fallen; life and death, terror and dread do not enter his breast.\nThus, though he collides with things, he is not afraid.\nIf one preserved by wine can be thus, how much more one preserved by Heaven?\nThe sage hides within Heaven—thus nothing can harm them.\n\nThe avenger does not break the sword’s edge;\nEven one with a vengeful heart does not resent a fallen tile—thus the world attains balance.\nTherefore, there are no wars of conquest, no punishments of slaughter—this is the Way’s doing.\nDo not open the Heavenly in man, but open the Heavenly of Heaven.\nOpening Heaven’s Heaven gives birth to virtue; opening man’s Heaven harms life.\nDo not reject one’s Heavenly nature, nor neglect the human—then the people approach their true essence.\"\n\nConfucius traveled to Chu and, passing through a forest, saw a hunchbacked man catching cicadas as if plucking them.\nConfucius said: \"You are skillful—do you have a method?\"\nThe man replied: \"I do. After five or six months of stacking pellets without dropping them, I lose only a fraction; with three pellets, I lose one in ten; with five, it is as if plucking them.\nWhen I steady my body, it is like a withered stump; when I extend my arm, it is like a dead branch.\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast and the myriad things many, I am aware only of the cicada’s wings.\nI do not turn aside, nor do I let the myriad things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail?\"\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said: \"Where intent is undivided, it approaches the divine.\"\n*(The Shu edition reads \"approaches\" (*yi*), and below it says: \"The vessel’s divinity lies in its concentration (*ning*)—is this not the hunchbacked elder’s meaning?\")*\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"Once, when I crossed the deep rapids of Shang, the ferryman handled the boat as if by magic. I asked him: ‘Can one learn to handle a boat?’ He said: ‘Yes. A skilled swimmer can learn quickly. As for those who dive and excel in the depths—even if they’ve never seen a boat, they can handle it immediately.’ I asked him, but he did not explain. May I ask what this means?\"\nConfucius said: \"A skilled swimmer can learn quickly because they have forgotten the water. As for those who dive and excel in the depths—even if they’ve never seen a boat, they can handle it immediately because to them, deep pools are like hills, and a capsized boat is like a cart rolling backward.\nTen thousand dangers may lie before them, yet none enter their dwelling—where could they not be at ease?\nOne who stakes tiles in a game plays skillfully; one who stakes hooks hesitates; one who stakes gold grows confused.\nTheir skill is the same, yet when they fixate on the stake, they value externals.\nAll who value externals are clumsy within.\n*(Here, the text shifts from the heart to the finger.)*\"",

You, sir, have traveled with Zhu Shen—what have you learned from him?\"\n\nField Kai replied: \"I merely wield broom and dustpan to tend the gates and courtyards. What could I have learned from the Master?\"\n\nDuke Wei said: \"Do not decline, Master Tian. I wish to hear it.\"\n\nKai said: \"I heard the Master say: 'One who nurtures life well is like a shepherd herding sheep—he watches those lagging behind and whips them.'\"\n\nDuke Wei asked: \"What does this mean?\"\n\nField Kai said: \"In Lu there was Shan Bao, who dwelled in the cliffs and drank from streams, sharing no profit with the people. At seventy, his complexion remained like a child’s. Unluckily, he met a starving tiger, which killed and devoured him. There was also Zhang Yi, who frequented every high gate and thin curtain, running wherever he was called. At forty, he died of internal heat-illness. Bao nurtured his inner self, yet the tiger consumed his outer; Yi nurtured his outer self, yet illness attacked his inner. These two men both failed to whip the laggards.\n\nWhen sheep have already moved forward, they need no whip. Only those falling behind require it—this illustrates that one who has already nurtured the inner need not labor further within, but should tend the outer; one who has already nurtured the outer need not labor further without, but should tend the inner.\n\nConfucius said: 'Do not withdraw to hide, do not emerge to display, stand like firewood in the center.' If these three are attained, one’s name will surely reach its peak. 'Stand like firewood' means to stand like withered wood. 'Stand like firewood in the center' means neither to emerge nor withdraw.\n\nThose who fear the roads—if one in ten is killed, fathers and sons, brothers and kin will warn one another, mustering armed retinues before daring to venture out. Is this not wisdom? Yet what people truly should fear lies in their bedding and at their meals, yet they fail to guard against it—this is their error.\n\nThe sacrificial officer, clad in dark robes, approaches the pen to address the pig, saying: 'Why do you hate death? I will fatten you for three months, purify you for ten days, fast for three, spread white couch-grass, and place your shoulder and rump upon the carved platter—would you accept this?' For the pig’s sake, he would say: 'Better to eat chaff and糟 and be left in the pen.' For his own sake, he would accept a life of noble carriages and caps, and a death upon painted shields and among heaped boughs. For the pig, he rejects it; for himself, he accepts it—how does he differ from the pig?\n\nPainted shields bear the design of pheasant feathers. Heaped boughs are woven mats for gathering things.\n\nDuke Huan was hunting in Fa Marsh, with Guan Zhong driving his chariot, when he saw a ghost.

Among the Qi scholars was one named Huangzi Gao’ao, who said: \"The Duke has harmed himself; how could a ghost harm him? When the qi of pent-up fury scatters and fails to return, it leads to deficiency. If it rises but does not descend, it makes one prone to anger. If it sinks but does not ascend, it makes one prone to forgetfulness. If it departs the center and lodges in the heart, it causes illness.\"\n\nDuke Huan asked: \"Then do ghosts exist?\"\nHe replied: \"They do. In the depths lurks *Lü*. The hearth harbors *Ji*. In the dusty corners within doors, *Leiting* dwells. Beneath the northeast lies *Bei’e*, where *Xielong* and *Longyue* leap. Beneath the northwest, *Yiyang* resides.

      "translated_text": "**Outer Chapters: The Mountain Tree**\n\nWhen Master Zhuang was traveling through the mountains, he saw a great tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. Asking the reason, he was told, \"It is of no use.\" Master Zhuang said, \"This tree, by being useless, has lived out its natural span.\"\n\nEmerging from the mountains, he lodged at the house of an old friend. The friend, delighted, ordered a servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked, \"One can caw, the other cannot— which should we kill?\" The host replied, \"Kill the one that cannot caw.\"\n\nThe next day, a disciple asked Master Zhuang, \"Yesterday, the tree in the mountains lived out its natural span by being useless; today, the host’s goose died for being useless. Where will you, Master, take your stand?\" Master Zhuang laughed and said, \"I will stand between usefulness and uselessness. Yet between usefulness and uselessness—though it seems so—it is not so, and thus one is not free from entanglement. But if one rides the Dao and floats upon virtue, it is otherwise: neither praised nor blamed, now dragon, now serpent, transforming with the times, never clinging to one form. Rising and falling, taking harmony as measure, drifting upon the ancestor of the ten thousand things. Treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by them—how then could one be entangled? This is the method of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor.\n\nAs for the nature of the ten thousand things and the transmission of human relations, it is not so. Union leads to separation, completion to ruin, sharpness to blunting, honor to slander, action to loss, worthiness to schemes, unworthiness to deceit. How can one be certain of anything? Alas! Remember this, disciples: it is only in the realm of Dao and virtue.\n\nThe worthy exhaust their minds scheming over affairs, while petty men turn to cunning and deceit.\n\nJiananyi of Shinan visited the Lord of Lu, who wore a troubled expression. Jiananyi asked, \"My lord, why this troubled look?\" The Lord of Lu replied, \"I study the Way of the former kings, cultivate the undertakings of my predecessors; I revere ghosts and honor the worthy; I practice this without the slightest lapse. Yet I cannot escape misfortune—this is why I am troubled.\"\n\nJiananyi said, \"My lord’s method of avoiding misfortune is shallow. The sleek fox and the patterned leopard dwell in the mountains and forests, crouch in caves and cliffs—this is stillness. They move by night and rest by day—this is vigilance. Though hungry and thirsty, in straitened circumstances, they still keep their distance upon the rivers and lakes while seeking food—this is steadfastness. Yet they cannot escape the calamity of nets and traps. What crime have they committed? Their skins bring disaster upon them. Is not the state of Lu your lordship’s skin? I wish you would carve away your form, shed your skin, wash your heart, cast off desire, and wander in the wilds where no man dwells.\"\n\n*Xu* means \"to assist\"; *shu* means \"to distance.\" Though hungry and thirsty, in straitened circumstances, they still keep their distance upon the rivers and lakes while seeking food—this means they remain in the mountains and forests, refusing to venture upon the rivers and lakes to seek food.\n\nIn the southern lands there is a city called the State of Establishing Virtue.

      "translated_text": "The reckless and wayward tread the great square of the Dao. Their lives may be joyful, their deaths may be buried. I wish you would abandon your state, cast off custom, and walk in mutual support with the Way.\n\nYou say: \"That Way is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what then?\"\nMaster South-of-Market replies: \"Do not cling to form or pride, do not linger in one place, and take this as your carriage.\"\n\nYou say: \"That Way is secluded and remote, with no one there—with whom shall I be neighbors? I have no provisions, no food—how can I reach it?\"\nMaster South-of-Market replies: \"Reduce your expenses, diminish your desires, and though you have no grain, you will find sufficiency. Cross the river and float upon the sea; gaze upon it and you will not see its shore. The farther you go, the less you will know its end. Those who see you off will turn back from the shore—from then on, you will be far away.\"\n\nFrom the State of Establishing Virtue in the south to this point, later generations have interpolated these words, crude and shallow, surely not the authentic voice of Zhuangzi.\n\nThus, to possess others is a burden; to be possessed by others is a sorrow. Therefore, Yao neither possessed others nor was possessed by them. I wish to relieve you of your burdens, remove your sorrows, and wander alone with the Way in the boundless realm.\n\nWhen a double-hulled boat crosses a river, an empty boat drifts into it—even a man of narrow heart would not grow angry. But if there were a man aboard, he would shout to steer it away. If the first shout goes unheard, he shouts again; if still unheard, he curses in anger. Before, he was not angry, but now he is—before, the boat was empty, but now it is full. If a man can empty himself and wander through the world, who can harm him?\n\nWhen Beigong She levied taxes for Duke Ling of Wei to cast bells, he built an altar outside the outer gate of the capital. In three months, the upper and lower chimes were complete. Prince Qingji saw this and asked: \"What method did you employ?\"\nShe replied: \"In the space of unity, I dared not impose any method. I have heard: after carving and polishing, return to simplicity. Vast and unknowing, drifting and hesitant, like plants growing wild and without intent—sending off the departing, welcoming the arriving. Let those who come not be barred, let those who go not be stopped. Follow the strong and unyielding, adapt to the crooked and compliant, and let them reach their own end. Thus, though taxes were levied day and night, not a hair was harmed—how much more so for those who tread the great path?\"\n\nThe Way is one alone; if you act with purpose, you divide it into two. Thus, in the space of unity, I dared not impose any method.\n\nVast and unknowing, drifting and without intent, like plants growing wild—this is the appearance of having no mind. The strong and unyielding are those who do not follow; those who are crooked and compliant simply follow their nature. To \"let them reach their own end\" means to accept what comes of itself. \"Not harmed\" means not diminished. The \"great path\" is the great Way. If even tax collection can be so, how much more so governing the world by the great Way?\n\nConfucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Taigong Ren went to console him, asking: \"Are you near death?\"\n\"Yes,\" Confucius replied.\n\"Do you hate death?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\nTaigong Ren said: \"Let me speak to you of the way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea there is a bird called *Yidai*. As a bird, it is slow and sluggish, appearing incapable. It flies only when supported, perches only when pressed. It does not dare to advance first or retreat last; it does not dare to eat before others, but must take the leftovers. Thus, it is never driven from the flock, and others never harm it—so it escapes misfortune. The straight tree is the first felled; the sweet well is the first drained. You, I fear, adorn your knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate yourself to expose the corrupt, shining brightly like one who carries the sun and moon in procession—how could you escape harm?\n\nLong ago, I heard from a man of great completion: 'Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit; those who achieve merit fall; those who achieve fame lose it. Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the common people?' The Way flows but does not dwell in fame; it acts but does not claim a place. Pure and constant, it is like one who is mad, erasing traces and diminishing attachments, not seeking merit or fame. Thus, it demands nothing of others, and others demand nothing of it. The perfected person does not strive—why do you delight in this?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Excellent!\" He then parted from his friends and disciples, fled to the great marsh, wore coarse cloth and furs, ate acorns and chestnuts, and entered among beasts without disturbing their herds, among birds without disrupting their flocks. Birds and beasts did not shun him—how much less would men?\n\nConfucius asked Zisang Hu: \"I was twice banished from Lu, had a tree felled in Song, was forced to erase my tracks in Wei, was impoverished in Shang and Zhou, and besieged between Chen and Cai. I have suffered these many misfortunes, my close friends growing more distant, my followers scattering—why is this?\"\n\nZisang Hu replied: \"Have you not heard of the escape of the man from Jia? Jia was a man who relied on others to flee. Lin Hui abandoned a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a baby on his back and run. Someone asked: 'Was it for the sake of its value? The baby’s value is slight. Was it for the burden? The baby’s burden is great. Why abandon a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a baby and run?' Lin Hui said: 'That was bound by profit; this is bound by heaven. Those bound by profit abandon each other in straitened circumstances, misfortune, and harm; those bound by heaven gather together in straitened circumstances, misfortune, and harm. The difference between gathering and abandoning is vast. Moreover, the friendship of a gentleman is as bland as water; the friendship of a petty man is as sweet as wine. The gentleman’s blandness brings closeness; the petty man’s sweetness brings estrangement. Those who come together without cause will part without cause.'\"\n\nConfucius said: \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\" He then walked slowly and leisurely home, abandoned his studies, discarded his books, and his disciples no longer vied for his attention before him—yet their love for him grew deeper.\n\nAnother day, Zisang Hu said: \"When Shun was about to die, he earnestly warned Yu: 'Be vigilant!'\"",

      "translated_text": "Shape should follow its natural course; emotions should follow their true nature. Following the natural course prevents separation; following true nature prevents exhaustion. Without separation or exhaustion, one does not seek adornment to match form. Thus, one does not depend on external things.\n\nZhenling Yu is a person’s name, and \"you\" refers to Shun.\n\nZhuangzi wore coarse cloth patched with hemp, tied his shoes with rough cords, and passed by King Wei. The king said: \"Why is the Master so weary?\" Zhuangzi replied: \"It is poverty, not weariness. A scholar who possesses the Dao and virtue yet cannot put them into practice—that is weariness. Worn-out clothes and tattered shoes are poverty, not weariness. This is what is called not encountering the right time. Has Your Majesty never seen the leaping monkeys? When they find themselves among nanmu, catalpa, and camphor trees, they grasp the vines and swing through the branches, reigning supreme—even Yi or Feng Meng could not take aim at them. Yet when they find themselves among thorn bushes, brambles, and jujube thickets, they move cautiously, glancing about in fear, trembling with dread. This is not because their sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened, but because their position is unfavorable, and they cannot fully display their abilities. Now, living amid a benighted ruler and chaotic ministers, how can one avoid weariness? This is like the fate of Bi Gan, whose heart was cut out as proof!\"\n\n*Zhengxi* means to straighten one’s sash.\n\nConfucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Leaning on a withered tree, he struck its dry branches and sang the airs of the *Yan* clan. There was the form of the music but not its precise structure, the sound but not its proper notes. The sound of the wood and the human voice blended like a plow turning the soil—loose and free—yet it resonated with the hearts of others. Yan Hui stood with folded hands, turning his gaze to observe. Fearing that Yan Hui might overreach in his admiration or grow sorrowful out of affection, Confucius said: \"Hui, it is easy to accept what heaven diminishes, but difficult to accept what others bestow. There is no beginning that is not also an end—humanity and heaven are one. Who is it that sings now?\"\n\nYan Hui said: \"May I ask why it is easy to accept what heaven diminishes?\" Confucius replied: \"Hunger, thirst, cold, and heat—when one is trapped and cannot move—are the workings of heaven and earth, the outflow of the movement of things. To speak of going along with them is to say one moves with them. As a minister, one does not dare to depart from this. If even the way of serving a ruler is like this, how much more so the way of awaiting heaven? Hunger, thirst, cold, and heat—when one is trapped and cannot move—are the flowing of heaven and earth’s *qi*, the movement and release of the myriad things, which cannot be stopped. To wish to avoid this, one would have to halt the *qi* of heaven and earth—one can only go along with it. A minister regards his ruler as heaven and earth; he must simply follow.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by it being difficult to accept what others bestow?\" Confucius said: \"At the outset, one’s path opens in all four directions, and ranks and emoluments arrive without end. What others find beneficial is not one’s own—one’s fate lies beyond such things. When one first gains employment, there are no obstacles. Ranks and emoluments may be grand and not without appeal, but one exhausts oneself in service only to benefit others—what does it have to do with oneself? One’s fate lies beyond such things. The gentleman does not steal; the worthy does not pilfer. What would I take from them? Thus it is said: No bird is wiser than the swallow. Where its eyes should not linger, it does not glance; even if its eggs fall, it abandons them and flees. Though it fears humans, it nests among them—only for the sake of the altars of soil and grain.\n\n*The swallow* is the swallow. *Does not glance* means it has no time. *Eggs* refers to its brood. *Altars of soil and grain* refers to the spring and autumn sacrifices to the gods of soil and grain. The swallow does not linger where it should not nest in human dwellings; even if its eggs fall, it abandons them without a backward glance. The reason is its fear of humans. Its nesting among humans only occurs during the sacrifices to the altars of soil and grain. Swallows come at the spring sacrifice and depart at the autumn sacrifice. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: 'Without bells and drums, it is called *stealth*.' This is merely a passing remark, yet commentators have made it needlessly abstruse and laughable—there are many such cases.\n\n\"What do you mean by 'there is no beginning that is not also an end'?\" Confucius said: \"When the myriad things transform, one does not know who succeeds them—how can one know their end? How can one know their beginning? One simply aligns with them and awaits.\"",
      "overlap_context": ". The gentleman’s blandness brings closeness; the petty man’s sweetness brings estrangement. Those who come together without cause will part without cause.'\"\n\nConfucius said: \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\" He then walked slowly and leisurely home, abandoned his studies, discarded his books, and his disciples no longer vied for his attention before him—yet their love for him grew deeper.\n\nAnother day, Zisang Hu said: \"When Shun was about to die, he earnestly warned Yu: 'Be vigilant!'\"",

      "translated_text": "\"What does it mean for humans and Heaven to be one?\" Confucius said: \"Where there is humanity, there is Heaven; where there is Heaven, there is also Heaven. That humans cannot possess Heaven is their nature. The sage, at ease, embodies the passing and comes to an end. In all matters beyond human capacity, whatever humans accomplish is Heaven. And what Heaven accomplishes is also Heaven. That humans cannot possess themselves is simply the spontaneity of Heavenly nature. Only the sage is one with Heaven—at ease, embodying the passing, calmly allowing body and self to pass away together.\"\n\nZhuang Zhou wandered near the fence of Carved Mound and saw an unusual magpie coming from the south. Its wings spanned seven feet in breadth, its eyes measured an inch in circumference. It brushed against Zhou’s forehead in flight, descended, and alighted in a chestnut grove. Zhuang Zhou said: \"What bird is this? Its wings are vast yet it does not fly far; its eyes are large yet it does not see clearly.\" He tucked up his robe, strode forward, took up his sling, and waited. He saw a cicada enjoying the fine shade and forgetting its own form. A mantis, seizing the opportunity, struck at it, seeing only its gain and forgetting its own shape. The unusual magpie, drawn by profit, seized the chance, seeing only the advantage and forgetting its true nature. Zhuang Zhou, startled, said: \"Alas! Things indeed entangle one another—two kinds summon each other.\" He cast aside his sling and turned to flee, but the gamekeeper pursued him with shouts and curses.\n\nZhuang Zhou returned home and for three months did not step into the courtyard. Lan Ju approached and asked: \"Master, why have you been so withdrawn lately?\" Zhuang Zhou replied: \"I guarded my form and forgot my self; I gazed upon muddy waters and became lost in clear depths. Moreover, I have heard from my master: 'Enter their customs, follow their customs.' Now I wandered in Carved Mound and forgot my self; the unusual magpie brushed my forehead, and I wandered in the chestnut grove and forgot my true nature. The gamekeeper of the chestnut grove took me for a disgrace—this is why I have withdrawn.\"\n\nYang Zi traveled to Song and lodged at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines—one beautiful, the other ugly. The ugly one was honored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yang Zi asked the reason, and the innkeeper’s servant replied: \"The beautiful one is self-aware of her beauty, so I do not recognize her beauty; the ugly one is self-aware of her ugliness, so I do not recognize her ugliness.\" Yang Zi said: \"Disciples, take note: act with virtue and abandon the conduct of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be loved?

      "translated_text": "Lúlíng’s Bamboo Peak, recorded by Luó Miǎndào, collated by disciple Péng Xiáng\n\n**External Chapters: Tián Zǐfāng**\n\nTián Zǐfāng attended upon Marquis Wén of Wèi and repeatedly praised Xī Gōng. The Marquis said: \"Xī Gōng—is he your teacher?\" Zǐfāng replied: \"No. He is but a villager of Wúzé. His praises were so apt that Wúzé could not but speak of him.\" The Marquis said: \"Then do you have no teacher?\" Zǐfāng said: \"I do.\" The Marquis asked: \"Who is your teacher?\" Zǐfāng said: \"Dōngguō Shùnzǐ.\" The Marquis said: \"Then why have you never spoken of him?\" Zǐfāng said: \"His way of being is true. His appearance is human, yet his nature is of Heaven; he follows things while preserving his authenticity; he is pure yet embraces all. Though he bears a human form, he accords with Heaven’s spontaneity; though empty, he follows things while guarding his truth; though clear, he contains all things. When beings lack the Dao, he meets them with upright bearing to awaken them, dissolving their intentions. When confronted with perversity, he simply rectifies what lies within himself, and their resistance melts away. How could Wúzé be worthy of speaking of him?\"\n\nZǐfāng departed. The Marquis, lost in thought, remained silent the whole day. Summoning the ministers who stood before him, he said: \"Far indeed is the gentleman of perfect virtue! At first, I thought the words of sagely wisdom and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness were the ultimate. But when I heard of Zǐfāng’s teacher, my form dissolved and I had no desire to move; my mouth was sealed and I had no desire to speak. What I have learned is but a clay figurine. Truly, Wèi has been a burden to me.\"\n\nWēnbó Xuězǐ traveled to Qí and lodged in Lǔ. A man of Lǔ requested an audience with him. Wēnbó Xuězǐ said: \"I cannot. I have heard that the gentlemen of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. I do not wish to meet him.\" When he arrived in Qí and returned to lodge in Lǔ, the same man again requested an audience. Wēnbó Xuězǐ said: \"Before, he sought to see me; now, he seeks to see me again—he must have some inspiration to stir me.\" He went out to meet the guest, then returned and sighed. The next day, he met the guest again and returned, sighing once more. His servant said: \"Every time you meet this guest, you return and sigh. Why?\" He replied: \"I told you before: the people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. The one who saw me earlier advanced and retreated like a compass or square, moved with the composure of a dragon or tiger. When he admonished me, it was like a son; when he guided me, it was like a father. That is why I sighed.\"\n\nConfucius met him and did not speak. Zǐlù said: \"Master, you have long wished to see Wēnbó Xuězǐ. Now that you have met him, you do not speak. Why?\" Confucius said: \"In such a man, the Dao is present at a glance—how could words contain it? The Dao is present the moment one’s gaze falls upon him; there is no need for careful examination.\"\n\nYán Yuān asked Confucius: \"When the Master walks, I walk; when the Master hurries, I hurry; when the Master runs, I run; when the Master dashes away, leaving no trace of dust, I can only stare blankly behind.\" Confucius said: \"Yuān, what do you mean?\" He replied: \"When the Master walks, I walk; when the Master hurries, I hurry; when the Master debates, I debate; when the Master runs, I run; when the Master speaks of the Dao, I speak of the Dao. Yet when you dash away, leaving no trace of dust, I can only stare blankly behind. For the Master speaks without needing to establish trust, unites without needing to form bonds, and though without instruments, the people gather before you—yet I do not know why.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Alas! How can you not examine this? There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart, and the death of the body is secondary to it. The sun rises in the east and sets in the westernmost reaches; all things follow its pattern. Those with eyes and feet depend on it to complete their tasks. When it rises, they exist; when it sets, they perish. All things are thus: some depend on it to die, some depend on it to live. Once I received this completed form, I did not change but awaited its end. I move in response to things, day and night without pause, not knowing where it will end. My form was completed as if by the steaming of qi, and even knowing fate, I cannot plan for what lies ahead. I have followed this path daily. My whole life, I have extended my arm to you, yet you have lost it—is this not sorrowful? I grieve for you, Yuān. You cling to what I cling to. He has already exhausted it, yet you seek it as if it still exists—this is like searching for something in an abandoned marketplace. What I wear, you forget; what you wear, I also forget. Yet why should you worry? Though you forget the old me, there is something in me that cannot be forgotten.\"\n\n\"Staring blankly behind\" means gazing straight ahead yet unable to catch up. \"Though without instruments, the people gather before you\" means that without tools to stir the people, they dance before you of their own accord. Yán Yuān did not understand why, so Confucius said: \"Alas! How can you not examine this?\" The reason he did not understand was that he had fixed his heart upon death. Thus, he used the sun as a metaphor: all things follow the sun’s rising and setting in their work and rest, and their life and death likewise depend on it. Confucius merely moved in response to things, flowing with them without cease, accepting his completed form without discussing fate, simply proceeding day by day. \"As if by steaming\" means as if formed by the steaming of qi. My whole life, I have been with you as if I had no conduct apart from the others, yet you have taken what I showed you daily as unattainable. This is like never having clasped arms, only extending one arm before losing it—how could it not be sorrowful? What you spoke of was merely the timely, what you saw of me was only what could be seen. \"Clinging\" means seeing.",

      "translated_text": "He refers to the Master as \"that one.\" That one has already attained perfect purity and emptiness, yet you seek in him what is substantial—like searching for a horse in a market stall. A market stall is indeed a place where horses are sold, but how could it always have horses?\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says, \"In the central courtyard, there is a cry.\" The annotation explains: \"The central courtyard is the path in the middle of the courtyard, a place for selling horses, with a path to facilitate their entry and exit.\" The *Book of Han* records: \"West of the Jianzhang Palace, there was a central courtyard spanning dozens of *li*.\" Yang Xiong’s *Preface to the ‘Feathered Hunt’* states: \"Sweet dew drips in the courtyard, sweet springs flow in the central path.\" Ban Gu’s *Rhapsody on the Western Capital* says: \"Before the central courtyard, the great pool is dredged.\"\n\n\"Péi-fú\" means to admire and follow. I admire your words, just as you admire mine—both should be utterly forgotten. Yet I fear Yan Yuan worries he will never attain this. Still, why should you worry? Within forgetting, there remains something unforgotten. What is forgotten is attachment; what remains unforgotten is the utmost truth. Though you forget my old teachings, if you gain something of your own, the unforgotten will still abide.\n\nConfucius visited Lao Dan, who had just washed his hair and was letting it dry, standing still as if not human. Confucius withdrew and waited to the side. After a while, he saw him and said: \"Was I deluded just now? Was it truly so? A moment ago, your form seemed like withered wood, as if you had abandoned things and stood apart from men.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"I let my heart wander in the beginning of things.\"\n\nConfucius asked: \"What do you mean?\"\n\nLao Dan replied: \"My heart was blocked and could not know; my mouth was shut and could not speak.\" (The character *bì* here is read as in \"to ward off evil,\" pronounced *bìyě*. The mouth was as if sealed and could not speak.) \"Yet I have tried to discuss with you what is to come. What is to come is what will be. Let me speak of the beginning of what will be: The utmost yin is solemn and still; the utmost yang blazes and surges. Solemn stillness emerges from heaven; blazing surging arises from earth. The two intermingle, harmonize, and things are born. Some serve as their pattern, yet no form is seen. They ebb and flow, fill and empty, now dark, now bright, changing day by day, month by month, acting without visible achievement. Life has its sprouting; death has its return. Beginning and end turn back without end, yet none know where they cease. If not this, then what is their source?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"May I ask about wandering in this?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"To attain this is the utmost beauty and utmost joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy—this is called the Perfect Man.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"I wish to hear the method.\"\n\nLao Dan replied: \"Herbivorous beasts do not shun swamps; aquatic creatures do not avoid water. Small changes occur without losing their great constancy. Joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness do not enter the breast. The world is where the myriad things are one. If you attain this oneness and become the same, then your four limbs and hundred parts will be but dust and grime, and life and death, beginning and end will be like day and night—nothing can disturb them. How much less could gain and loss, fortune and misfortune affect them? Those who discard servitude do so as if discarding mud and mire, knowing the body is nobler than servitude. Nobility lies within me and does not lose itself in change. Moreover, the myriad transformations have no end—what is there to trouble the heart? Those who have attained the Way understand this. Only those who have personally realized the Way can comprehend it.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Your virtue matches heaven and earth, yet you still borrow the utmost words to cultivate your heart. Of the noble men of old, who could escape this?\"\n\n(Here, *shuō* is read as *tuō*, meaning \"to escape.\")\n\nLao Dan said: \"Not so. Water, when it flows, does nothing yet naturally displays its ability. The Perfect Man, in regard to virtue, does not cultivate it, yet things cannot depart from him. Like heaven’s natural height, earth’s natural depth, the sun and moon’s natural brightness—what cultivation is needed?\"\n\nConfucius left and told Yan Hui: \"In the Way, I am like a vinegar fly. Without the Master’s uncovering of my blindness, I would not have known the great completeness of heaven and earth.\"\n\nZhuangzi visited Duke Ai of Lu. The Duke said: \"In Lu, there are many Confucians, but few who practice your methods.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Lu has few Confucians.\"\n\nThe Duke said: \"The whole state of Lu wears Confucian garb—how can you say there are few?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"I have heard that Confucians wear round caps to know the seasons, square shoes to know the earth’s forms, and jade pendants that sway to decide matters when they arise. Those who possess the Way are not necessarily those who wear its garb; those who wear its garb do not necessarily know the Way. If you truly do not believe this, why not issue a decree throughout the state: 'Those who lack this Way yet wear its garb shall be put to death.'\"\n\nThe Duke issued the decree for five days, and no one in Lu dared wear Confucian garb. Only one man, dressed as a Confucian, stood at the palace gate. The Duke summoned him and questioned him about state affairs. His answers were inexhaustible, shifting a thousand ways without end.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"With the whole state of Lu, there is only one Confucian—can this be called many?\"\n\nBaili Xi did not let rank and salary enter his heart, so when he fed cattle, the cattle grew fat. This made Duke Mu of Qin forget his lowly status and entrust him with governance. The lord of Yu did not let life and death enter his heart, so he could move others.\n\nThe Lord of Song Yuan was about to have paintings made. Many scribes arrived, bowed and stood, licked their brushes and mixed ink—half remained outside. One scribe arrived late, strolled in unhurriedly, bowed but did not stand, and went to his quarters. The Lord sent someone to observe him. He had taken off his clothes and was sitting cross-legged, bare-chested. The Lord said: \"He is the true painter.\"\n\nKing Wen observed at Zang and saw an old man fishing—but his fishing was no fishing. Though he fished, he did not fish. He did not hold his fishing for what could be caught but fished constantly.",

      "translated_text": "King Wen wished to promote the old fisherman and entrust him with governance, yet feared his great ministers and elders would not accept it. He wished to let the matter rest, yet could not bear the thought of the people being left without a protector. Thus, at dawn, he gathered his ministers and said: \"Last night, I dreamed of a worthy man—dark of complexion, with a beard, riding a piebald horse with one red hoof. He called himself Yu and took charge of governance at Zang. Might this not bring relief to the people?\"\n\nThe ministers, startled, said: \"It was your late father, the former lord.\"\n\nKing Wen said: \"Then let us divine his will.\"\n\nThe ministers replied: \"The command of the former lord requires no further confirmation. What need is there for divination?\"\n\nThereupon, they welcomed the old fisherman of Zang and entrusted him with governance. No laws were altered, no new decrees issued. After three years, King Wen surveyed the realm and found: the ranks of scholars had dissolved their factions and scattered, high officials no longer sought to distinguish themselves, and the grain measures dared not enter the four borders. When the ranks of scholars dissolved their factions and scattered, it showed they valued unity; when high officials no longer sought distinction, it showed they shared a common purpose; when grain measures dared not enter the four borders, it showed the feudal lords harbored no divided loyalties.\n\nKing Wen then made him Grand Preceptor and, facing north, asked: \"Can governance thus extend to all under Heaven?\"\n\nThe old fisherman of Zang remained silent and gave no answer, then vaguely declined and fled by night, never to be heard of again.\n\nTo \"fish with a hook\" is to angle for what can be caught—namely, fish. To \"fish constantly\" is to cast the line habitually without intent to catch. It is not to hold one’s fishing for what can be caught but simply to fish without ceasing.\n\nThe \"former lord\" in King Wen’s dream was his father. \"No new decrees issued\" means he never issued a single command. \"Dissolved their factions\" means they abandoned their established positions and no longer sought to stand apart from others. This account follows the precedent of Lü Wang, yet appears as a separate matter.\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"Was King Wen still not content? Why did he need to dream?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Silence. Say no more. King Wen had already perfected it—what need is there for criticism? He merely followed the momentary impulse. That momentary impulse meant: 'I am worth a hundred of you, or three of you.'\"\n\nLie Yukou shot for Bohun Wuren, drawing the bow to its fullest and placing a cup of water on his elbow. When he loosed the arrow, it met the previous one, and as one arrow flew, another took its place on the string. At that moment, he resembled a wooden figure.\n\nBohun Wuren said: \"This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Let us ascend a high mountain, tread on perilous rocks, and stand above an abyss of a hundred fathoms. Then you may shoot.\"\n\nThereupon, Bohun Wuren climbed the high mountain, trod on perilous rocks, and stood above the abyss. Turning his back, he retreated until two-thirds of his feet hung over the edge, then beckoned Lie Yukou forward. Lie Yukou prostrated himself, sweat streaming to his heels.\n\nBohun Wuren said: \"The perfected man gazes up to the blue sky, plunges down to the Yellow Springs, roams to the eight limits, yet his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with fear in your eyes—you are in grave danger.\"\n\n\"Met the previous arrow\" means the arrow flew and struck the one before it. \"As one arrow flew, another took its place\" means that as one arrow was loosed, the next was already on the string. \"Turning his back, he retreated until two-thirds of his feet hung over the edge\" means he faced the mountain with his back to the abyss, retreating until two-thirds of his feet extended beyond the edge.\n\nShan Wu asked Sunshu Ao: \"You have thrice served as Prime Minister without pride, and thrice been dismissed without sorrow. At first, I doubted you, but now I see your nostrils flare with ease—what is the secret of your heart?\"\n\nSunshu Ao said: \"How do I surpass others? I accept what comes without refusal and let go what departs without hindrance. I regard gain and loss as no concern of mine, and thus remain free of sorrow. How do I surpass others? Moreover, how do I know whether it lies with them or with me? Whether it lies with them and vanishes from me, or with me and vanishes from them? I am still hesitating, still looking around—what leisure have I to consider whether men are noble or base?\"\n\n\"Nostrils flare with ease\" describes his calm breathing as he lies at rest.\n\nConfucius heard of this and said: \"The true men of old could not be swayed by the wise, seduced by the beautiful, robbed by thieves, or befriended by Fuxi or the Yellow Emperor. Life and death are great matters, yet they remained unchanged—how much more so titles and emoluments! Such men’s spirit threads through the great mountains without obstruction, enters the deepest springs without getting wet, dwells in lowliness without weariness, and fills Heaven and Earth. The more they give to others, the more they possess themselves.\"\n\n\"Without obstruction\" means without hindrance.\n\nThe King of Chu sat with the Lord of Fan. After a while, the King’s attendants announced three times that Fan had perished.\n\nThe Lord of Fan said: \"Fan’s perishing does not diminish my existence. If Fan’s perishing does not diminish my existence, then Chu’s existence does not ensure its own existence.

      "translated_text": "Lu Lian of Bamboo Peak in Luling, as recorded by his disciple Peng Xiang, collated:\n\n*External Chapters: \"Knowledge Wanders North\"*\n\nKnowledge wandered north to the Dark Waters, ascended Hidden Peak’s Returning Cloud Mound, and there encountered Non-Action’s Discourse.\n\nKnowledge said to Non-Action’s Discourse: \"I wish to ask you: What thoughts, what reflections attain the Dao? What abiding, what practice settle into the Dao? What following, what path obtain the Dao?\"\n\nThree questions, yet Non-Action’s Discourse gave no answer. Not that he refused to answer—he did not know how to answer.\n\nKnowledge, receiving no response, returned south of the White Waters, ascended Fox Tower, and there beheld Mad Qu. Knowledge posed the same questions to Mad Qu.\n\nMad Qu said: \"Alas! I know the answers and would tell you, yet mid-speech I forget what I wished to say.\"\n\nKnowledge, still unanswered, returned to the Imperial Palace and questioned the Yellow Emperor.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"Without thought, without reflection—only then does one attain the Dao. Without abiding, without practice—only then does one settle into the Dao. Without following, without path—only then does one obtain the Dao.\"\n\nKnowledge asked the Yellow Emperor: \"You and I know these answers—pointing to the Yellow Emperor—yet those two—pointing to Non-Action’s Discourse and Mad Qu—do not. Which of you is correct?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"Non-Action’s Discourse is truly right; Mad Qu approaches it; you and I remain far from it. For those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Thus the sage enacts the teaching of no-words. The Dao cannot be attained; virtue cannot be reached. Benevolence may be practiced, righteousness may be diminished, ritual is mutual pretense. Therefore it is said: Lose the Dao, then virtue follows; lose virtue, then benevolence follows; lose benevolence, then righteousness follows; lose righteousness, then ritual follows. Ritual is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of chaos. Therefore it is said: Those who practice the Dao daily diminish, diminishing further and further, until they reach non-action. Through non-action, nothing is left undone. Now that you have already become entangled with things, to return to the root is no easy task. Is it not only the great person who finds it easy?\n\nLife is the companion of death; death is the beginning of life. Who knows their boundary? Human life is the gathering of qi. Gathered, it becomes life; scattered, it becomes death. If death and life are companions, what cause have I for sorrow? Thus the ten thousand things are one. What they deem wondrous is called spirit-like; what they despise is called foul decay. Yet foul decay transforms into spirit-like, and spirit-like transforms into foul decay. Therefore it is said: The world is pervaded by a single qi. Thus the sage values unity.\"\n\nKnowledge said to the Yellow Emperor: \"I asked Non-Action’s Discourse, and he did not respond—not that he refused me, but that he did not know how to respond. I asked Mad Qu, and mid-speech he wished to tell me yet did not—not that he refused me, but that mid-speech he forgot. Now I ask you, and you know the answers. Why, then, are you not close to the truth?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"He is truly right because he does not know. This one approaches it because he forgets. You and I remain far because we know.\"\n\nMad Qu heard this and deemed the Yellow Emperor’s words wise.\n\nHeaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons follow bright patterns yet do not debate; the ten thousand things have completed principles yet do not explain. The sage traces Heaven and Earth’s beauty and comprehends the ten thousand things’ principles. Thus the perfected person does nothing; the great sage does not act—this is called observing Heaven and Earth.\n\nNow, that numinous clarity and utmost essence accompany the hundred transformations. Things die and live, square and round—none know their root. Yet Pien and Pian, though alike, sustain the ten thousand things, which have endured since antiquity. The Six Directions are vast, yet nothing lies beyond their bounds; an autumn hair is small, yet depends on them to form its body. The world knows no constancy, yet all things rise and fall without ceasing. Yin and yang, the four seasons, move in their proper order. Obscurely, they seem absent yet remain; effortlessly, they take no form yet are spirit-like. The ten thousand things nurture and transform, unaware—this is called the root. Through it, one may observe Heaven.\n\nThat numinous clarity and utmost essence reside in the human heart. Yet people cannot observe as the sages do, so Heaven grants them that numinous clarity and utmost essence to accompany the hundred transformations. Thus things die and live, square and round—none know their root, yet the departed are gone, fluttering away without return. The principles of the ten thousand things have always endured; people simply fail to perceive them.\n\nThe Dao has no inside or outside, no small or great. The world is bound within the ebb and flow of growth and decline, ever-renewed and unchanging. The four seasons’ order moves without cease. Those who can be obscurely absent yet present, effortlessly formless yet spirit-like, nurturing the ten thousand things without awareness—only they know the root and may observe Heaven.\n\nNie Que asked the Way of Clothed-in-Skins. Clothed-in-Skins said: \"Straighten your form, unify your gaze—Heaven’s harmony will arrive. Collect your knowledge, unify your measures—spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will adorn you; the Dao will reside within you. Your eyes will be bright as a newborn calf’s, seeking no reason for things.\"\n\nBefore the words were finished, Nie Que fell asleep. Clothed-in-Skins rejoiced greatly, departed singing, and said: \"His form like withered bones, his heart like dead ashes—truly he knows reality, not clinging to the past. Dim and obscure, dark and indistinct, without mind, he cannot be schemed with. What manner of person is he?\"\n\nShun asked Cheng: \"Can the Dao be possessed?\"\n\nCheng said: \"Your body is not your own possession. How could you possess the Dao?\"\n\nShun said: \"If my body is not my own, who possesses it?\"\n\nCheng said: \"It is Heaven and Earth’s entrusted form. Life is not your own—it is Heaven and Earth’s entrusted harmony. Nature and destiny are not your own—they are Heaven and Earth’s entrusted compliance. Children and grandchildren are not your own—they are Heaven and Earth’s entrusted molting. Thus, when you walk, you know not where you go; when you abide, you know not what you hold; when you eat, you know not the taste.\"",

The Dao is profound and hard to express. Let me speak of its outlines: radiance emerges from obscurity, order arises from formlessness, spirit is born of the Dao, and form originates from essence. All things beget one another through form. Thus, creatures with nine orifices are born from the womb, while those with eight emerge from eggs. Its coming leaves no trace; its going has no boundary. Without gate or chamber, it pervades all four directions in boundless vastness. Those who attain this have strong limbs, penetrating thoughts, keen ears, and sharp eyes. Their minds do not toil, yet they respond to things without fixed method. Heaven cannot but be high, Earth cannot but be broad, sun and moon cannot but move, and all things cannot but flourish—this is the Dao.\n\nMoreover, grasping it does not ensure understanding; debating it does not ensure wisdom. The sage has already settled this. As for that which gains nothing when augmented and loses nothing when diminished, this is what the sage preserves.

      "translated_text": "One in the Central States transcends beyond yin and yang, dwelling between heaven and earth merely as a transient human, soon to return to their origin. That origin is the Great Void. Viewed from the Great Void, human life is but a fleeting shadow. As the *Record of Rites* annotates: \"醷 is plum juice; 喑 means long-fermented.\" Though the juice ferments long, how much time can it truly hold? Those who live many days are called long-lived; those who live few, short-lived. Thus, all that世人 contend over is but a moment’s tale—why debate the right and wrong of Yao and Jie?\n\nFruits and gourds have their principles; though human relationships are complex, they serve to order ranks. The sage encounters them without resistance, passes them without clinging. Harmonizing and responding is virtue; coinciding and responding is the Dao. From this arise emperors and kings.\n\nThough fruits and gourds are humble things, their branches, flowers, and fruits still follow principles. The relationships of ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, friends—though seemingly intricate—serve to order ranks. The sage dwells among these human relationships, meeting them without resistance, never abandoning them; passing them without clinging, never lingering over them. Harmonizing with them and responding is how virtue is enacted; coinciding with them and responding is how the Dao is enacted. The rise of emperors and kings is no different.\n\nHuman life between heaven and earth is like a white colt passing through a gap—gone in an instant. Bursting forth, nothing fails to emerge; flowing smoothly, nothing fails to return. Transformed, one is born; transformed again, one dies. Living things mourn this; humankind grieves it. Loosening the bow-case of heaven, casting off the bonds of fate—tumultuous, winding, the soul departs, and the body follows. Thus, the great return.\n\nThe formless taking form, form dissolving into the formless—this is what all people know, yet it is not what the perfected strive for. This is what the multitude debate. Those who attain it do not debate; those who debate do not attain it. Clear insight finds no encounter; disputation is not as good as silence. The Dao cannot be heard; hearing is not as good as blocking the ears. This is called the Great Attainment.\n\nTumultuous, winding—these describe the loosening of the bow-case and casting off of bonds. \"The formless taking form\" means arising from nothing; \"form dissolving into the formless\" means returning to nothing. *值* means \"to encounter.\" The essence of the Great Dao is that clear insight cannot encounter it—thus, disputation is not as good as silence.\n\nDongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi: \"Where does the so-called Dao reside?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is nowhere absent.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Specify, and then it may be acceptable.\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in the ants.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Why so low?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in the weeds.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Why even lower?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in the tiles.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Why still lower?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in excrement and urine.\"\nDongguo Zi did not respond.\nZhuangzi said: \"Your question fundamentally misses the mark. When Zheng and Huo asked the market inspector about weighing a pig by stepping on it, the lower they went, the clearer the condition became. *期* means to specify. *质* means the root. Your question was vague and did not reach the root, so my answer was thus. Zheng and Huo refer to the *Rites of Drinking and Archery*, where there are officers called *Sizheng* and *Sihuo*. The market inspector weighs pigs by stepping on them to gauge their weight. Though *Sizheng*, *Sihuo*, and the market inspector have different duties, they are all involved in the same affair. Stepping on the pig—from its upper body to its lower—each step reveals more about its fatness or leanness. The common saying that a pig’s thighs being even indicates its fatness is an example. The more one descends, the more evident the condition becomes—thus, the Dao may be observed. You must not insist on certainty; nothing escapes it.\n\nThe supreme Dao is like this; so too is the great discourse. *Zhou* (all-encompassing), *bian* (pervasive), and *xian* (complete)—these are different names for the same reality, their meaning one. Have you ever wandered together in the Palace of Nothingness, merging in discussion without end? Have you ever practiced non-action together? Serene and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease? My will is emptied—wherever I go, I do not know my destination; departing and returning, I do not know where I rest. I have come and gone yet do not know my end, roaming through the Gate of Vastness. Great wisdom enters and does not know its limit.\n\n*莫* means \"not so\"; *必* means \"certain.\" This aligns with the *Analects*: \"No predisposition, no prejudice.\" The above states the Dao is nowhere absent, so here it says: you must neither insist nor deny—simply follow the natural course of things without resistance. This is what the supreme Dao is like; so too is the great discourse. *Zhou*, *bian*, and *xian*—though different names, their reality is one, encompassing all things. In this way, all is affirmed; otherwise, all is negated—thus, no contention arises.\n\n*尝* means \"to try.\" Have you ever wandered together in the Palace of Nothingness, merging in discussion without end? *寥* means \"empty.\" \"My will is emptied\"—my mind is void. Though I may go somewhere, it is as if I do not go, and I do not know my destination. Though I depart and return, I do not know where I rest. Though I have come and gone, I do not know I have done so—thus, I do not know my end. *Feng hong* is the gate of emptiness.

The Dao should not be named.\"\n\nWu Shi said: \"One who answers when asked about the Dao does not know the Dao. Even the one who asks about the Dao has not heard the Dao. The Dao admits no questions; questions admit no answers. To ask what cannot be asked is to ask into the inscrutable. To answer what cannot be answered is to lack inwardness. Responding to the inscrutable with what lacks inwardness—such a one outwardly does not observe the cosmos, inwardly does not know the Great Beginning. Thus, he does not pass beyond Kunlun, nor roam the Great Void.\"\n\nGuang Yao asked Wu You: \"Sir, do you exist? Or do you not exist?\"\nGuang Yao, receiving no answer, gazed intently at Wu You’s appearance: it was empty and hollow. He looked at him all day but saw nothing; he listened but heard nothing; he reached out but grasped nothing.\n\nGuang Yao said: \"This is perfection! Who could attain this? You can be without being, but you have not yet attained non-being. How could one reach this state of non-existence?\"",

      "translated_text": "The master blacksmith of Da Ma, who forged belt hooks, was eighty years old yet never missed a hair’s breadth in his work. Da Ma asked: \"Is your skill innate, or do you follow a Way?\"\n\nThe smith replied: \"Your servant has a discipline. At twenty, I took delight in forging belt hooks. I saw nothing else in the world—nothing but hooks claimed my attention. Thus, what I employ borrows from what I do not employ, and so I long attain its use. How much more so for one who employs nothing without employing it? What thing does not draw upon this?\"\n\nDa Ma was the Grand Marshal. The \"belt-hook forger\" was a smith who hammered clasps.\n\nRan Qiu asked Confucius: \"Can one know what existed before Heaven and Earth?\"\nConfucius said: \"Yes. The past is as the present.\"\n\nRan Qiu, unsatisfied, withdrew. The next day, he returned and said: \"Yesterday, I asked whether one could know what existed before Heaven and Earth. You said, ‘Yes. The past is as the present.’ Yesterday, I understood clearly; today, I am confused. May I ask what this means?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Yesterday’s clarity came because your spirit first received it. Today’s confusion arises because you now seek it with what is not spirit. There is no past, no present, no beginning, no end. Could there be descendants before there were descendants?\"\n\nRan Qiu had no reply. Confucius said: \"Enough. No answer is needed. Do not use life to give life to death, nor use death to give death to life. Do life and death depend on something? All share a single body. Is there something that existed before Heaven and Earth? That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. Things cannot emerge before that which gives rise to them—just as there is no thing without self. The sage’s love for others never ends, for it draws from this very principle.\n\nThe spirit is the luminous clarity of the human heart. Yesterday’s clarity came when the heart’s spirit first grasped it. Today’s confusion arises when this heart is suddenly obscured, and what is not spirit intrudes. Heaven and Earth have no past or present, no beginning or end. Your question about what existed before Heaven and Earth is like asking whether there could be descendants before there were descendants. ‘No answer is needed’ means Ran Qiu’s question does not require an answer—I have spoken for you.\n\nLife arises of itself; it does not use life to give life to death. Death arises of itself; it does not use death to give death to life. Life and death do not depend on anything—they are simply one body in life, one body in death. How could there be something that existed before Heaven and Earth? That which bursts forth and is called ‘the giving rise to things’ is not itself a thing. Before birth, where was this body? Things cannot emerge before that which gives rise to them. It is as if something gives rise to them, and if something gives rise to them, then the Way of ceaseless arising has no end. The sage’s love for others never ends, for it draws from the principle of ceaseless arising.\"\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"I once heard you say, ‘Do not send off, do not welcome.’ May I ask about its wandering?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"The ancients transformed outwardly but remained untransformed inwardly. People today transform inwardly but remain untransformed outwardly. One who transforms with things is one who does not transform. How can one be at peace with transformation or non-transformation? How can one be at peace and yet grind against them? One must inevitably be worn away until little remains.\n\nThe parks of Xi Wei, the gardens of the Yellow Emperor, the halls of Yu, the chambers of Tang and Wu—these were the domains of rulers. The followers of Confucians and Mohists took them as masters, and so they contended with right and wrong. How much more so for people today? The sage dwells among things without harming them. One who does not harm things cannot be harmed by them. Only one who harms nothing can send off and welcome others.\n\nOne who transforms outwardly but remains untransformed inwardly responds to things without the heart following them. One who transforms inwardly but remains untransformed outwardly has no settled heart and is buffeted by affairs. To transform with things is outward transformation. To remain untransformed is inward non-transformation. What is this ‘peace’? What is transformation? What is non-transformation? How can one be at peace and yet grind against them? One will inevitably be consumed until little remains.\n\nFrom Xi Wei, the Yellow Emperor, Yu, Tang, and Wu down to the Confucians and Mohists, all contended with right and wrong, wearing each other away.

The people of Weilei said to one another: “When Master Gengsang first arrived, we regarded him with surprise. Now, when we reckon our days, we find them insufficient, but when we reckon our years, we find them abundant. He must be a sage! Why do you not join together to honor him as a spirit, to offer him sacrifices of millet and grain?”\n\nWhen Gengsang Chu heard this, he turned southward, displeased. His disciples found this strange. Gengsang Chu said: “Disciples, why do you find me strange? When spring’s qi arises, the hundred grasses grow; when autumn arrives in due season, the myriad treasures ripen. Is it not the Dao’s unfolding that makes spring and autumn thus? The Perfect One, I have heard, dwells like a corpse in a walled chamber, while the common people roam wildly, not knowing where to turn. Now these petty folk of Weilei secretly wish to place me among the sacrificial vessels of the thousand worthies—am I to be one who is displayed like a marker? This is why I cannot let go of Master Lao Dan’s words. The Perfect One dwells like a corpse in a walled chamber, while the common people roam wildly, not knowing where to go—this means that when the Perfect One conceals himself, people do not know his name and thus wander without direction. A marker is made by raising wood so that all may see it. ‘Cannot let go of Master Lao Dan’s words’ means that the Way of Lao Dan takes non-action as its essence, yet people still cannot forget him; this is why I cannot let go of his words.”\n\nHis disciples said: “Not so. In a ditch of ordinary size, great fish have no room to turn their bodies, while eels and loaches rule there; on a hillock of a few fathoms, great beasts have no place to conceal themselves, while foxes and badgers thrive.

      "translated_text": "The beast that fits in a carriage, once armored and parted from the mountain, cannot escape the snares of nets; the fish that swallows a boat, once beached and parted from the water, is tormented even by ants. Thus birds and beasts do not tire of heights, fish and turtles do not tire of depths. Those who preserve their bodily form and life conceal themselves, and nothing suffices for them but the deepest obscurity.\n\nMoreover, as for those two—Yao and Shun—what are they worth extolling? In their disputations, they would recklessly breach walls to plant mugwort and thistles, comb their hair strand by strand, count grains of rice to cook them—how could such petty fussing ever save the world? Promote the worthy, and the people contend; gather the clever, and the people steal. These measures do not enrich the people. The people’s pursuit of profit is relentless: sons kill fathers, ministers kill rulers; in broad daylight they rob, at midday they plunder.\n\nI tell you: the root of great disorder arose between Yao and Shun, and its branches endure a thousand generations hence. There will surely be men who devour one another.\n\nNanrong Chu sat bolt upright and said: “At my age, I am already old—how can I entrust myself to a practice that might reach such understanding?”\n\nGengsang Chu said: “Preserve your form, embrace your life, and let not your thoughts race restlessly. If you do this for three years, you may attain this understanding.”\n\nNanrong Chu said: “Eyes and form—I do not see their difference, yet the blind cannot see themselves; ears and form—I do not see their difference, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves; heart and form—I do not see their difference, yet the mad cannot grasp themselves. Form and form should open to one another, yet things somehow come between them. We seek each other but cannot find each other. Now you tell me: ‘Preserve your form, embrace your life, let not your thoughts race restlessly.’ I strain to hear the Way, but it reaches only my ears.”\n\nGengsang Chu said: “My words are exhausted. It is said: the fleeing bee cannot transform the hornworm, the Yue chicken cannot hatch the swan’s egg—only the Lu chicken can. Chickens are all chickens, their virtue no different. What distinguishes them is ability or inability, for their talents are inherently great or small. My talent is small and cannot transform you. Why not go south to see Laozi?”\n\nGengsang Chu taught Nanrong Chu to preserve his form, but Nanrong Chu was unconvinced: “Let me speak of form—eyes, ears, heart—all are part of the same body, no different in kind. Yet the blind cannot see themselves, the deaf cannot hear themselves, the mad cannot grasp themselves. When form is bestowed, it should open freely, yet things come between, so that though we seek each other, we cannot find each other. Thus form cannot be preserved whole.” Though Nanrong Chu strained to hear Gengsang Chu’s Way, it reached only his ears—his eyes saw nothing, his heart grasped nothing.\n\nGengsang Chu then drew an analogy: “The common saying captures it: the fleeing bee cannot transform the hornworm, the Yue chicken cannot hatch the swan’s egg. This illustrates that my talent is too small to transform you, so I send you to see Lao Dan.”\n\nNanrong Chu packed provisions and, after seven days and nights, arrived at Laozi’s abode. Laozi said: “Have you come from the land of Chu?”\n\nNanrong Chu said: “Yes.”\n\nLaozi said: “Why have you brought so many people with you?”\n\nNanrong Chu turned fearfully to look behind him.\n\nLaozi said: “Do you not understand what I mean?”\n\nNanrong Chu bowed his head in shame, then looked up and laughed, saying: “Now I have forgotten my answer and so lost my question.”\n\nLaozi said: “What do you mean?”\n\nNanrong Chu said: “If I am ignorant, people call me a fool—like Zhu, who was unworthy, so that later ages call the unperceptive ‘Zhu the fool.’ If I am wise, it only brings sorrow to my body. Without benevolence, I harm others; with benevolence, I bring sorrow upon myself. Without righteousness, I injure others; with righteousness, I bring sorrow upon myself. How can I escape this? These three sayings are my afflictions. I wish to ask you about them through Chu.”\n\nLaozi said: “Just now, I saw it in the space between your brows—I understood you then. Now you speak and confirm it. You are like one who has lost his parents, raising a pole to search the seas—you are a lost man, as if something is missing. Bewildered, you seek to return to your nature but have no way in. Pitiable indeed!”\n\nNanrong Chu asked to enter and rest in his lodging. He summoned what he loved and cast off what he hated. After ten days of sorrow, he saw Laozi again.\n\nLaozi said: “You have cleansed yourself—why are you still so troubled? Yet within, you still brim with what is foul. What is bound on the outside cannot be grasped if one clings too tightly—it must be released from within. What is entangled within cannot be grasped if one forces it—it must be released from without. Those bound both inside and out cannot be held by virtue and power—how much less those who act without the Way?”\n\n“Troubled” here means “distracted.” “Brim” means “overflowing.” You have cultivated and cleansed yourself, appearing composed, but this is only external. Within, you still flow with what is foul.",

      "translated_text": "Here the term \"韄\" signifies binding objects with leather straps to restrain them. \"犍\" refers to the bolt of a door that locks it shut. When what is restrained externally becomes too numerous to grasp, it will turn to internal resistance and closure. When what is restrained internally becomes chaotic and ungraspable, it will turn to external resistance and closure. With such afflictions both inside and out, even one possessed of virtue and power will be unable to maintain equilibrium—how much less those who merely imitate the Way in their conduct?\n\nNanrong Chu said: “When a villager falls ill, his neighbors come to his gate. If the patient can describe his symptoms, yet does not understand the cause of his illness, he remains as one who has not truly fallen ill.” The latter two instances of \"illness\" mean that if one can thoroughly explain the cause of the affliction, though the illness may be severe, it is as if it were not severe at all. “My hearing of the great Dao is like taking medicine that only worsens the disease. I wish only to learn the classic of preserving life.”\n\nLaozi said: “The classic of preserving life—can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it? Can you know good and ill fortune without divination? Can you come to rest? Can you cease? Can you abandon seeking in others and turn to seeking within yourself? Can you be carefree? Can you be uncontrived? Can you be like a child? A child may wail all day without hoarseness—for harmony is at its utmost. He may clench his fists all day without cramping—for he shares in the power. He may gaze all day without blinking—for his attention is not fixed on externals. He moves without knowing where he goes, dwells without knowing what he does, flowing with things and riding their waves. This is the classic of preserving life.”\n\nNanrong Chu said: “Is this then the virtue of the perfected one?” “This is what is called the thawing of ice and the melting of frost. The perfected one shares sustenance with others upon the earth and rejoices with them under heaven. He does not entangle himself with the gains and harms of men and things, nor does he conspire with others in strangeness, scheming, or affairs. He comes and goes with ease, uncontrived. This is the classic of preserving life.”\n\n“Then is this perfection?” “A child acts without knowing what he does, moves without knowing where he goes. His body is like the branch of a withered tree, his heart like dead ashes. In such a state, misfortune does not arrive, nor does fortune come. With neither misfortune nor fortune, how can there be human calamity?”\n\nNanrong Chu doubted whether Laozi’s words on the classic of preserving life were indeed the virtue of the perfected one. Laozi said: “Not so. This is what is called the thawing of ice and the melting of frost. When ice and frost first dissolve, they have not yet fully melted—this is not yet perfection. The perfected one shares sustenance with others upon the earth, comes and goes uncontrived—all this describes the state of the perfected. Yet what was spoken earlier is merely the classic of preserving life.”",

      "translated_text": "Then is this the ultimate state?” Nanrong Chu asked, “Is this the utmost of the Way of preserving life?”\n\nLaozi replied: “It is not yet the ultimate. What I have told you is merely this: one who embodies the childlike can be free from misfortune and fortune. When the cosmos is at peace and settled, it radiates the light of Heaven. One who radiates the light of Heaven—people see such a person, and those who cultivate themselves may thereby attain constancy. Those who attain constancy are abandoned by others yet aided by Heaven. Those abandoned by others are called the people of Heaven; those aided by Heaven are called the sons of Heaven.\n\nThe learner learns what cannot be learned. The doer does what cannot be done. The debater debates what cannot be debated. To know when to stop at what cannot be known—this is the ultimate. If there is any who does not conform to this, the great balance of Heaven will undo him.\n\nWhen the heart’s cosmos is at peace and settled, it naturally radiates the light of Heaven—this is what is called ‘settled life gives rise to wisdom.’ Those who see one radiating the light of Heaven may think it a human ability, yet they do not know it arises from the heart’s cosmos being at peace and settled—this is Heaven. There are those who cannot achieve this settled state of the heart’s cosmos and must rely on cultivation; even so, they cannot radiate the light of Heaven. They may only attain constancy. Those who attain constancy, though abandoned by others, are surely aided by Heaven. Those abandoned by others remain without rank and are the people of Heaven; those aided by Heaven hold rank and are the sons of Heaven.\n\nYet these are not the ultimate. The ultimate must utterly cast aside cleverness, knowledge, and deliberation, as if utterly incapable—only then is it the ultimate. Those who cannot achieve this are undone by the great balance of Heaven; it is not that Heaven does not aid them.\n\nThe great balance is my own great balance. Prepare things to nurture form; store what is unforeseen to establish the heart; maintain reverence within to reach without. If, despite this, myriad evils arrive, they are all of Heaven, not of man—they cannot disturb one’s accomplished virtue, nor can wayward matters enter the numinous terrace. The numinous terrace has something it holds, yet one does not know what it holds, nor can it be held.\n\n*Nurture* means to cultivate; *store* means to preserve; *establish* means to stand. Externally, one prepares things to nurture form; internally, one constantly preserves unforeseen defenses to establish the heart. One maintains reverence within to reach without. If misfortune arrives thus, it is all the decree of Heaven, not summoned by human affairs—it cannot disturb my accomplished virtue, nor can wayward matters enter my heart. Though the heart has something it holds, others do not know what it holds. There is that which cannot be held—this means that which cannot be grasped.\n\nHong Mai’s *Rongzhai Random Jottings* records Hong Qingxiang’s explanation, which is merely a Confucian interpretation: “If one does not see the sincerity within oneself manifest, every manifestation will be inappropriate. Though one’s deeds have entered a situation, one cannot let them go, and each time makes further errors. Doing evil in the open, others may punish it; doing evil in secret, ghosts may punish it. Only when one is clear about others and clear about ghosts can one act alone.”\n\nThis reverses the earlier text. Only when one has not yet achieved sincerity within does every manifestation miss the mark. Though one clearly knows it is insincere, one’s deeds have already entered the situation and cannot be removed. Unable to correct the error, one instead compounds it, thus incurring the calamities of others and ghosts—one cannot speak of wayward matters here.\n\nThose within their allotted bounds act without seeking fame; those beyond their allotted bounds act with expectations of vast expenditure. Those who act without seeking fame, though obscure, have a radiance; those who aspire to vast expenditure are but merchants. People see them as towering, yet they are hollow. Those who exhaust themselves in competition with things find things occupying their place; those who merely accommodate things cannot even contain themselves—how can they contain others? Those who cannot contain others have no intimacy; those with no intimacy are forsaken by all.\n\n*Within their allotted bounds* means within one’s proper role. Those who seek within their proper role do not pursue fame. Those who seek beyond their proper role aspire to vast and lavish expenditure. The *Doctrine of the Mean* says, “The Way of the noble person is vast yet hidden.” Those who act without seeking fame, though obscure, have a radiance in their use. Those who aspire to vast expenditure seek to dazzle and sell themselves in the world, like merchants. Or like one who stands on tiptoe—people see them as towering and grand, yet in truth they are not. Those who go beyond their bounds exhaust themselves in competition with things, and things instead occupy their place. Those within their bounds accommodate things without being burdened, and do not even know they have a self—how could they know others? Without others, even the closest kin are absent; without intimacy, all people are absent. This is the meaning of standing apart from the world.\n\nNo weapon is more reckless than the will; even *Mo Ye* is inferior. No enemy is greater than yin and yang—there is no escape from them between Heaven and Earth. It is not that yin and yang harm one; the heart causes it.\n\nThe Way flows through one’s allotted bounds—its completion is its destruction. What is detestable about allotted bounds is their duality; allotment exists for preparation. Why detest preparation? Because it implies something to prepare for. Thus, to go forth and not return is to see one’s ghost. To go forth and gain is called gaining death. To perish yet have substance—this is one kind of ghost. Using what has form to model what is formless—this is settled.\n\nOriginally, there was no completion or destruction; people divided themselves into two. Thus, the Way flows through one’s allotted bounds. What is detestable about allotment? How does one allot it? If distant, it must reach the extreme. Completion involves a hundred kinds of schemes to achieve success; destruction involves complete abandonment, letting ruin take its course.\n\n*Preparation* means extremity. Why detest extremity? Because once extreme, it is like one who goes forth and does not return. One only sees them pursuing external things, gradually worn away, like a ghost bent and unable to rise. Yet the world believes that going forth brings gain—this is nothing but the way of gaining death.”",

      "translated_text": "The Way of gaining death extinguishes this life. Yet one believes it possesses true substance—how does this differ from a ghost? Using what has form to model what is formless is to use a person to model a ghost. What is \"settled\" cannot return to being human.\n\nTo go forth without root, to enter without aperture—possessing substance yet without location; having length yet without root or tip, where root and tip are the same. To emerge yet have no aperture is to possess substance. Possessing substance yet without location is space; having length yet without root or tip is time. There is life, there is death; there is going forth, there is entering. Entering and emerging without seeing its form—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is Non-Being. The myriad things emerge from Non-Being. Being cannot use Being to create Being; it must emerge from Non-Being, and even Non-Being is not Non-Being. The sage conceals himself therein.\n\nThe so-called Way emerges without showing its root, enters without showing its aperture, possesses substance yet does not reveal its location. *Piao* is the same as *biao*, meaning \"tip.\" It has length yet does not show its root or tip. Though it emerges without root and enters without aperture, it still possesses substance. It is not empty words—possessing substance yet without location, like the four directions and above and below of space, which have no fixed place. Having length yet without root or tip, like the past and present of time, which have no beginning or end. Life and death, going forth and entering—none reveal their form; this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is emptiness and Non-Being. The myriad things emerge from Non-Being. All Being cannot use Being to create Being; it must emerge from Non-Being, and even Non-Being is not Non-Being. The sage cherishes and conceals this Way.\n\nThe ancients, their knowledge reached a certain point. To what point? Some believed there had never been anything—this is the ultimate, the utmost, beyond which nothing can be added. Those next believed there were things, taking life as loss and death as return—thus they divided themselves. They already split life and death into two paths. Those next said: first there was Non-Being, then there was life, and life swiftly turned to death. They took Non-Being as the head, life as the body, and death as the tail. Who knows the one who guards the unity of Being, Non-Being, death, and life? I befriend such a one.\n\nThough these three differ, they belong to the same clan. The Zhaos and Jings were distinguished by office; the Jia clan was distinguished by fief. They were not the same. *Dai* means official duty; *feng* means enfeoffment. Though these three differ, they are like the Zhaos, Jings, and Jias—all noble clans of Chu—some distinguished by office, some by fief, yet differing in this alone.\n\nThere is life, and the five flavors congeal into blackness—*yan* (black) and *xian* (salty) are pronounced similarly—scattered, it is called \"shifting this.\" Once one speaks of \"shifting this,\" it is no longer what was spoken of. Yet it remains unknowable. The sacrificial meat of the *La* festival includes the tripe—*pi* (pronounced *pihai*, the third stomach of a cow)—which can be separated but not truly divided. One who inspects a house must circle the ancestral temple and bedchambers, then proceed to the resting quarters. This illustrates \"shifting this.\" *Yan* is the blackness at the bottom of a cauldron. *Piran* means \"scattered.\" *Yi shi* means the \"this\" that shifts and does not remain fixed. *La* is the name of the sacrifice held on the third *xu* day after the winter solstice. *Pi* is the omasum (the third stomach of a cow). *Hai* refers to the hair and flesh of the toes. *Yan* is the chamber for rest. What people take as \"this\" is like the specks at the bottom of a cauldron—scattered and shifting, never fixed. Thus it is called \"shifting this.\"\n\nTo speak of \"shifting this\" is fundamentally baseless, yet there are indeed unknowable things. For example, in the *La* sacrifice, the tripe and toe flesh are divided on the platter—this can be separated—but as parts of a single sacrificial animal, they cannot be truly divided. Or when inspecting a house, one must circle the ancestral temple and bedchambers to call it complete, yet one must also reach the resting quarters. To observe one aspect, one must divide to unite; to observe another, one must unite to divide—this is unknowable. From this perspective, where is there a true \"this\"? Thus the saying of \"shifting this.\"\n\nLet us speak of \"shifting this\": taking life as the root, knowledge as the teacher, and thereby riding upon right and wrong. Truly believing in names and realities, taking oneself as the essence, making others take it as one’s integrity—even dying to uphold this integrity. Those who do so use action as wisdom and inaction as foolishness; thoroughness as fame and poverty as disgrace. \"Shifting this\" is the way of people today—like the cicada and the owl, they are the same in their sameness.\n\nThe above speaks of \"there is life, and the five flavors congeal into blackness,\" scattered, called \"shifting this.\" This \"shifting this\" refers to people who take life as fundamental, valuing it too heavily. Following knowledge, they generate right and wrong; believing in names and realities, they know only themselves. Establishing integrity, they would even die without hesitation. Such people are moved by success and failure, poverty and prosperity. Thus, \"shifting this\" is the way of the common people today. How do they differ from the cicada and the owl in their narrow views? People are the same as these creatures—thus it is said they are \"the same in their sameness.\"\n\nTrampling a stranger’s foot in the marketplace, one apologizes profusely; trampling a brother’s foot, one merely soothes him; trampling a parent’s foot, one does not even do that. Thus it is said: the utmost ritual does not involve others; the utmost righteousness does not treat things as things; the utmost knowledge does not scheme; the utmost benevolence has no partiality; the utmost trust repels weapons without need for metal.\n\n*Jian* means \"to tread upon.\" Accidentally stepping on a stranger’s foot in the marketplace, one apologizes excessively for the lack of restraint. Stepping on a brother’s foot, one merely soothes him. For parents, not even soothing is necessary. *Bi* means \"to repel.\" The utmost trust does not require metal or jewels as collateral. It unbinds the knots of ambition, resolves the errors of the heart, removes the burdens of virtue, and opens the blockages of the Way.",

      "translated_text": "The six of noble rank, wealth, prominence, majesty, fame, and profit stir the ambitions of the will; the six of countenance, movement, complexion, principle, qi, and intent distort the heart; the six of aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight burden virtue; the six of advancing, retreating, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability obstruct the Way. When these four sets of six do not agitate the breast, one is upright; upright, then still; still, then luminous; luminous, then empty; empty, then non-action and yet nothing is not done.\n\nThe passages in the text that are thus verbose and impertinent may well be omitted.\n\nThe Dao is the reverence of virtue; life is the radiance of virtue; nature is the essence of life. *Qin* means \"reverence,\" implying restraint. The Dao precedes virtue, hence it is said: the Dao is the reverence of virtue. With virtue, one nourishes the self, hence it is said: life is the radiance of virtue. Nature arises together with life, hence it is said: nature is the essence of life.\n\nWhen nature moves, it is called *wei*; the artificiality of *wei* is called loss. *Zhi* means \"to engage\"; *zhi* means \"to deliberate.\" The knowledge of what the wise do not know is like a sidelong glance. Movement through necessity is called virtue; movement without self is called governance. Names may oppose one another, yet realities align.\n\nYi excelled at hitting the subtle mark yet was clumsy at preventing others from praising him; the sage excels at Heaven yet is clumsy at humanity. One who excels at Heaven and is *liang* (good) at humanity may yet be capable of humanity. Only the complete person can do so. Only the insect-like can be insect-like; only the insect-like can be Heaven-like. The complete person detests Heaven, detests the Heaven of others, let alone the Heaven of oneself in relation to others.\n\nThe sage excels at uniting with Heaven yet is clumsy at preventing others from praising him. Only the complete person can excel at Heaven and also at humanity—yet how could they boast of this? If the insect-like can be insect-like and also Heaven-like, then being human-like and Heaven-like is not enough to boast of. Thus the complete person detests the reputation of being Heaven-like, and moreover detests the Heaven of others, let alone one’s own Heaven in relation to others.\n\nWhen a single sparrow approaches Yi, Yi must capture it—such is his might. If the world is made into a cage, then no sparrow can escape. Thus Tang used a kitchen servant to enclose Yi Yin, and Duke Mu of Qin used five sheepskins to enclose Bai Li Xi. Therefore, there is nothing that cannot be captured if one uses what they love as the cage.\n\nThe hunchback discards adornment, indifferent to external praise or blame. The convict climbs high without fear, having abandoned life and death. The amputee limps along, his form already incomplete, unconcerned with others’ praise or blame. The convict climbs high without fear, for among prisoners, life and death are held lightly. How can one who is swayed by external glory, disgrace, likes, or dislikes be caged?\n\nResponding without offering and forgetting others—by forgetting others, one thereby becomes a Heavenly person. Thus, one who is revered yet feels no joy, or insulted yet feels no anger, is one who harmonizes with Heavenly harmony. Anger expressed without anger means anger arises from non-anger; action performed as non-action means action arises from non-action. To still the mind, calm the qi; to spiritually attune, follow the heart. In action, to be fitting, align with necessity. The category of necessity is the Way of the sage.\n\n*Fu* means \"to respond.\" *Xie* is the same as *zhe*, meaning \"soft speech.\" In responding, one speaks softly and subtly, as if compelled, never forcing words upon others—so much so that one forgets others. This sentence should be read in three parts.\n\n*Nanhua Zhenjing Xunben*, Scroll Twenty-Two, concludes.",

Stepping on a brother’s foot, one merely soothes him. For parents, not even soothing is necessary. *Bi* means \"to repel.\" The utmost trust does not require metal or jewels as collateral. It unbinds the knots of ambition, resolves the errors of the heart, removes the burdens of virtue, and opens the blockages of the Way.",

      "translated_text": "#1 The character *zhe* 者 has been added according to the common edition.\n\n*Nanhua Zhenjing Xunben*, Scroll Twenty-Three\nRecorded by Lu Ling Zhu Feng’s Luo Miandao\nCollated by Disciple Peng Xiang\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: Xu Wugui**\n\nXu Wugui, through the introduction of Nü Shang, was granted an audience with Marquis Wu of Wei.\n*Shiwen* notes: Xu Wugui was a recluse from Minshan in Wei.\nLi [Yun] says: Wugui and Nü Shang were both favored courtiers of Wei.\n\nMarquis Wu greeted him, saying: “Master, you must be weary—exhausted by the toils of mountain and forest, and thus you have come to see me.”\nXu Wugui replied: “It is I who am wearied by you, my lord. What weariness have you for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your likes and dislikes, the true nature of your life will sicken. If you suppress your desires and cast off your likes and dislikes, your ears and eyes will sicken. I would weary you, my lord—what weariness have you for me?”\n\nMarquis Wu, appearing aloof and self-exalted, made no reply.\nAfter a moment, Xu Wugui continued: “Let me tell you how I judge dogs. Those of low quality seize their fill and stop—such is the virtue of a wildcat. Those of middling quality gaze as if toward the sun. Those of the highest quality seem as though they have forgotten their own singularity. Dogs are meant for hunting. The low-quality ones capture only enough to fill their bellies and then cease—this is mere wildcat talent. *De* here means ‘capacity.’ The middling ones, with lofty aspirations and far-reaching vision, like one gazing at the sun in the sky, disregard small prey before them—surely superior to the lower sort. Yet the highest quality ones consider hunting itself beneath them. Though hunting is the dog’s sole purpose, the finest among them lose sight of their specialization, transcending the common dog entirely.”\n\n“My judgment of dogs is not as refined as my judgment of horses. When I judge horses: the straight align with the marking cord, the curved with the hook, the square with the carpenter’s square, the round with the compass. This means they respond to the reins in perfect accord with these measures. Such are the horses of a state—yet they do not compare to the horses of the world. The horses of the world possess a perfected capacity, appearing anxious yet absent, as though they have lost their singularity. *Anxious yet absent*—as if dazed and forgetful. The horse’s singular purpose is to run. When it forgets its specialized task, it emerges as a steed beyond the ordinary. Such horses surpass all bounds, leaving no trace—transcending dust, their destination unknown. *Chaoyi* means ‘to surpass.’ *Juechen* means their hooves do not touch the earth, raising no dust.”\n\nMarquis Wu was greatly pleased and laughed.\nWhen Xu Wugui departed, Nü Shang asked: “Master, how did you alone succeed in delighting my lord? When I attempt to persuade him, whether I expound broadly with the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, or present the subtleties of the *Golden Tallies* and *Six Strategies*—the *Golden Tablets* and *Six Strategies* being chapters from the Zhou *Book of War*, the *Six Strategies* of the Grand Duke comprising the *Civil*, *Martial*, *Tiger*, *Leopard*, *Dragon*, and *Hound*—those who have served him with great merit are beyond counting, yet my lord has never so much as parted his lips. How did you delight him?”",

When they have been away from their state for several days, they rejoice at seeing those they know. When they have been away for a month, they rejoice at seeing those they once saw within the state. After a full year, they rejoice even at seeing those who merely resemble people—does this not show that the longer one is parted from others, the deeper one’s longing grows? Now, those who flee into the emptiness of the wilds, where brambles and thorns block the paths of weasels and badgers, stumble through the void, and when they hear the sound of human footsteps—*qiong*—they rejoice.

This illustrates how, for so long, no one has spoken essential words to Marquis Wu, so that even hearing talk of dogs and horses brings him joy.\n\nWhen Xu Wugui met with Marquis Wu, the marquis said: “Master, you dwell in the mountains and forests, eating acorns and chestnuts, spurning scallions and leeks, and have kept your distance from me for so long.

Ascending heights does not make one tall; dwelling low does not make one short. Yet you alone, as lord of ten thousand chariots, afflict the people of your state to nourish your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—while the spirit does not consent to this. The spirit delights in harmony and detests perversity. Perversity is sickness, and thus I come to relieve it. Why does your lordship alone suffer from this sickness?\"\n\nMarquis Wu then asked what weighed upon his thoughts and caused him distress.\nMarquis Wu said: \"I have long wished to meet you, Master. I desire to cherish the people and practice righteousness by laying down arms—would this be possible?\"\nXu Wugui said: \"It would not. To cherish the people is the beginning of harming them; to practice righteousness by laying down arms is the root of raising arms. If you persist in this, it will likely not succeed. All perfected beauty is a baleful vessel. Though you act with benevolence and righteousness, you will verge on hypocrisy. Form inevitably begets form; once traces appear, further traces are added. Success inevitably invites attack; change inevitably brings external conflict. Once this heart stirs, it contends with external things.\n\nYou must not array your cranes in battle formation between the towers of the *Liqiao*, nor station infantry and cavalry in the ancestral temples of *Zitan*. The *Helie* is a battle formation, like the *Yuli*. The *Liqiao* is a tower’s name. *Tu* means foot soldiers; *ji*, cavalry. *Zitan* refers to the grounds of ancestral sacrifices. This is to say: desires and strife within the heart are like spears and halberds within a chamber.\n\nDo not store up resistance in your gains, for with gain comes loss, and adversity is already concealed within fortune. Do not seek to overcome others with skill, nor with strategy, nor with warfare. Those who slaughter the people’s soldiers and seize their lands to nourish their own selfishness and spirit—how can one know which side is right? Where does victory lie?\n\nIf you cannot desist, then as the saying goes—even if Mencius could not stop, there is still one path: cultivate sincerity within your breast to respond to the feelings of Heaven and Earth, and do not provoke conflict. The people’s deaths will have ceased; what need will you then have for laying down arms?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor, seeking to meet the Great Vastness at Mount Jucí, had Fangming as his driver and Changyu as his outrider.

They override and question every matter.\n\nThose who summon the age serve in court; those of middling ability take pride in office; those of physical strength boast of hardships; the brave rush into peril; warriors delight in battle; recluses cling to fame; legalists expand governance; ritualists revere decorum; the benevolent and righteous value connections. *Zhaoshi* means taking the world as one’s own task, as if stirring it; *xing chao* means standing in court; *su ming* means leaving a name; *gui ji* means prizing social ties.\n\nFarmers without the work of clearing weeds grow estranged; merchants without the bustle of markets grow estranged; commoners with daily tasks are diligent; artisans with skill in tools are bold. *Bi* means unity—without it, they lose their livelihood and scatter. *Quan* means exerting effort; *zhuang* means acting with courage.\n\nWealth unaccumulated troubles the greedy; power unconsolidated saddens the boastful—those who love grandeur and crave influence delight in change. When the times afford use, they cannot remain inactive. All these follow the seasons in accord, not altering with things.\n\nThey exhaust their bodies and natures, sinking into the myriad things, never returning—how lamentable! *Wu* means affairs; *tu* means kind. Those fond of power and change take joy in inconstancy. One should meet such times with equanimity; when opportunity arises, one cannot remain inactive, yet need not act like the greedy or boastful. Those who understand this principle align with the seasons without shifting with things. Yet people today exhaust their bodies and natures, sinking into the myriad things unawares, living out their lives without return—how pitiable!\n\nZhuangzi said: \"An archer who hits the mark without aiming is called a master shot—would it be right to say all under heaven are Yi?\" Huizi said: \"Yes.\" Zhuangzi said: \"If there is no universal rightness, and each takes their own rightness as right, would it be right to say all under heaven are Yao?\" Huizi said: \"Yes.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Then the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists—four schools—and you make five. Which is truly right? Or is it like Lu Ju? His disciple said: ‘I have grasped the Master’s Way! I can heat a cauldron in winter and make ice in summer!’ Lu Ju said: ‘This merely summons yang with yang and yin with yin—it is not what I call the Way. Let me show you my Way.’ Thereupon, he tuned two zithers, placing one in the hall and one in the chamber. When he plucked the *gong* note on one, the *gong* note on the other sounded; when he plucked the *jue* note, the *jue* note responded—their pitches were in harmony. Then he altered one string so it no longer fit the five notes. When he plucked it, all twenty-five strings vibrated, yet the sound was not distinct, for it had become the ruler of tones. Is this not like that?\n\nAn archer must aim at the target to hit it—this is called a master shot. If one hits by chance without aiming, would it be right to say all under heaven are Yi? This illustrates that if there is no universal rightness, and each takes their own rightness as right, would it be right to say all under heaven are Yao?\n\nHeating a cauldron in winter means making fire without flame in cold weather; making ice in summer means creating ice without cold in heat. Though these seem marvelous, they merely follow winter’s yang to summon yang for fire, or summer’s yin to summon yin for ice—nothing extraordinary.\n\n*Fei* means to place. He set one zither in the hall and one in the chamber. Plucking the *gong* note on one caused the *gong* note on the other to sound; plucking the *jue* note caused the *jue* note to respond. This seems marvelous, yet it occurs because their pitches harmonize—nothing extraordinary. Like when Cao Shaokui, a master of tones, visited a monk in Luoyang whose chime would sound day and night of its own accord. The monk, deeming it strange, fell ill. Shaokui, a friend, came to inquire. The monk explained, and just then, striking a bell caused the chime to sound again. Shaokui laughed: \"Prepare a feast tomorrow, and I will rid you of this.\" The monk complied. After eating, Shaokui took a file from his sleeve, struck the chime several times, and the sound ceased. The monk pressed him for the reason. He said: \"The chime’s pitch matched the bell’s, so they resonated.\" The monk rejoiced, and his illness was cured.\n\nAnother example: Li Sizhen heard a carriage bell’s echo underground. Digging, he found a bell—such things happen.\"",

      "translated_text": "The term *dang* (当) means \"to govern.\" As the *Xue Ji* states: \"When a drum is struck without aligning with the pitch of the five tones, or when a single string is altered apart from the five notes, yet the drum is sounded without a governing tone, all twenty-five strings will resonate. Though this one string initially differs in no way, it becomes the master of all sounds. Thus, when struck, the other strings obey its command.\"\n\nThe sixty-four modes all arise from the *huangzhong* gong, for gong is the sovereign and thus commands the other pitches. This is but the natural principle—what is there to find strange? If such is the case, then Yuhuizi’s self-assurance resembles that of Lu Ju.\n\nHuizi said: \"Now, the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists all engage me in debate, clashing words and overpowering voices, yet they have never proven me wrong—what do you make of that?\" Huizi replied: \"Zhuangzi says I stand with the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists as five, yet who is correct? The four cannot refute me, so I am right, and they are wrong. What of this argument?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"A man of Qi sent his son to Song to serve as a gatekeeper, dismissing him because his body was imperfect. Yet though his form was flawed, he was still his own son—how could he bear to cast him out? Consider this: when seeking a tripod or bell, one binds and secures it for fear of damage. How does this compare to abandoning one’s child? Or when seeking a servant for the hall path, one keeps him within the domain—how does this differ from exiling a son abroad? In such ways, the principle of kinship is neglected. People are blinded by distinctions of closeness and distance, nobility and baseness, near and far, unaware of their own delusion. This illustrates how Huizi recognizes the errors of the four schools yet fails to see his own.\"\n\nThe man of Chu who lodged aboard a boat and served as a gatekeeper in exile once fought with a boatman in the dead of night, though he had not yet reached shore—enough to sow resentment. *Li* (离) means \"to reach,\" and *cen* (岑) refers to a mountain bank. The man of Chu, dwelling on a boat and limping as a gatekeeper in a foreign land, quarreled with the boatman at night when no one was present. He did not consider that before reaching shore, such conflict would only breed enmity. This further illustrates that contention not only blinds one to reason but also invites disaster.\n\nZhuangzi, passing by Huizi’s grave while attending a funeral, turned to his followers and said: \"A man of Ying had plaster as thin as a fly’s wing on the tip of his nose. He called upon Craftsman Shi to carve it away. Craftsman Shi swung his axe like the wind, heeding the task and striking, removing all the plaster without harming the nose. The man of Ying stood unmoved. When the Lord of Song heard of this, he summoned Craftsman Shi and said, 'Try it for me.' Craftsman Shi replied, 'Your servant once could do this. However, my partner is gone. The one who stood still was my partner. The one who struck was my tool. He has been dead for a long time. Since the Master’s passing, I have had no partner, no one to speak with.'\"\n\nWhen Guan Zhong fell ill, Duke Huan asked him: \"Your illness has grown severe.

      "translated_text": "Confucius spoke of two men who resolved conflict and stilled weapons through non-action—then why should I speak at all? If words were of use, I would wish for a beak three feet long; if words were of no use, such a beak would be useless. That is what they call the Way beyond the Way, and this is what they call the eloquence beyond words. \"They\" refers to the two men; \"this\" refers to Confucius. Thus, virtue encompasses the unity of the Dao, and words cease where knowledge knows no more—this is perfection. The unity of the Dao cannot be matched by virtue; what knowledge cannot know cannot be expressed by eloquence. To bear the names of Confucian or Mohist is already perilous.\n\nThus, the sea does not refuse the eastward flow—such is its boundlessness. The sage embraces heaven and earth, bestowing blessings upon the world, yet none know his name. Therefore, in life he holds no rank, in death he bears no posthumous title; no wealth is amassed, no fame is established—this is the Great Man. A dog is not deemed good for its fine barking, nor a man for his fine words—how much less so for greatness. To be great is not enough to be called great, and how much less so for virtue. Yet nothing is more complete than heaven and earth. What do they seek to be so complete? One who knows completeness seeks nothing, loses nothing, discards nothing, and does not exchange the self for things. Turning inward without exhaustion, following antiquity without friction—this is the sincerity of the Great Man.\n\nZiqi had eight sons; he lined them up before him and summoned Jiufang Yin, saying: \"Examine my sons for me and tell me which is most auspicious.\" Jiufang Yin replied: \"Kun is the most auspicious.\" Ziqi started in surprise and joy: \"In what way?\" He said: \"Kun will share the ruler’s table and feast until the end of his days.\" Ziqi’s face fell, and tears welled up: \"How could my son come to such an extreme?\" Jiufang Yin said: \"To share the ruler’s table brings blessings to three clans—how much more to his parents. Now, sir, you hear this and weep—this is to reject fortune. The son is auspicious, but the father is not.\" Ziqi said: \"Yin, how could you know this? Is Kun truly auspicious? His fate is bound to meat and wine, entering only through nose and mouth—how could you know its origin? I have never herded, yet a ewe was born in the inner chamber; I have never hunted, yet a quail hatched in the hearth. I have never tended sheep, never hunted, yet these creatures appeared in my home as if born in the inner chamber or hearth. This echoes the *Book of Songs*: *'Without hunting, without stalking, why do I see quails hanging in your courtyard?'* Yet if one does not marvel at such things, what is there to wonder at?\n\nThose with whom I wander wander through heaven and earth; with them I roam in joy beneath the sky, with them I feast upon the earth. I do not involve myself in their affairs, do not join their schemes, do not share their marvels. With them I ride the sincerity of heaven and earth, untouched by things, and drift along without being bound to their concerns. Now, if this is so, is there any recompense from the world? Wherever strange omens appear, strange conduct must follow. Alas, this is not the fault of my son or me—it is heaven’s doing. This is why I weep.\"\n\nBefore long, Kun was sent to Yan, where bandits seized him on the road. Selling him whole would be difficult, but maiming him would make it easy. So they cut off his feet and sold him in Qi, where he ended up in the marketplace of Qu Gong—yet he still ate meat and lived out his days.\n\nNie Que met Xu You and asked: \"Where are you going?\" He replied: \"I am fleeing from Yao.\" \"Why?\" \"Yao is so earnestly benevolent that I fear he will become a laughingstock to the world. Future generations may even turn to cannibalism. The people are not hard to gather: love them and they draw near, benefit them and they come, praise them and they are encouraged, bring them what they hate and they scatter. Love and benefit arise from benevolence and righteousness, but those who discard benevolence and righteousness are few, while those who profit from them are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness lacks sincerity and is but a tool for the greedy and rapacious. Thus, for one man to decide what benefits the world is like a fleeting glance—momentary and unreliable. Yao knows that worthy men benefit the world but does not see that they also harm it. Only those beyond worthiness understand this.\"\n\nThere are those who are *nuan shu*, those who are *ru xu*, and those who are *quan lou*. The *nuan shu* learn the words of a single master, warming themselves with self-satisfaction, delighting in their own beauty, and believing themselves complete—yet they do not know that nothing has truly begun. This is what is called *nuan shu*. The *ru xu* are like lice on a pig: they choose sparse bristles, thinking it a vast palace; they nestle in the crooks of hooves, between teats and thighs, believing it a safe and comfortable dwelling. They do not know that one day the butcher will roll up his sleeves, spread straw, and light the fire—then they and the pig will burn together. They advance and retreat within their narrow domain—this is what is called *ru xu*. At ease, they cannot extricate themselves. *Ru* means stagnation; *xu* means waiting.\n\nThe *quan lou* is like Shun. Mutton does not long for ants, but ants long for mutton—because of its rank odor. Shun had a rank character, and the people delighted in him. He moved three times, and each time his settlement became a city; by the time he reached Deng’s ruins, he had a hundred thousand households. Yao, hearing of Shun’s worthiness, raised him from barren land, saying: \"I hope to receive his blessings.\" Shun was raised from barren land, his years advanced, his senses dulled, yet he could not return to rest—this is what is called *quan lou*. Bent and hunched, unable to stand upright. Thus, the spirit-man detests the multitude’s approach, for when the multitude comes, they do not harmonize, and when they do not harmonize, no benefit arises.",
      "overlap_context": "heir weapons. Would that I had a beak three feet long!\"\n\nSunshu Ao was the son of Wei Jia, named Ai Lie, and served as Prime Minister under King Zhuang of Chu—before Confucius’ time. Shinan Yiliao was skilled at juggling balls and bells, keeping eight in the air while one remained in his hand. When Chu and Song went to war, Yiliao bared his chest and performed his juggling before the army, halting the battle and securing victory. This, too, occurred after Confucius’ death. It is but an allegory.",

Above, it speaks of Shun gaining the multitude yet being unable to return to rest. Thus, it says the spirit-man detests the multitude’s approach, for when the multitude comes, each has likes and dislikes, and when they do not harmonize, strife arises, bringing no benefit. Therefore, one who holds no partiality in relations, embraces the Dao and warmth, aligning with the world—this is called the Perfected Person.\n\nAs for the earlier saying that ants long for mutton, ants possess knowledge, so they cannot be without desire. Sheep cannot be without intent, so they cannot be without rankness. The Perfected Person, however, to ants abandons knowledge, to sheep abandons intent. The insertion of \"to fish, he attains strategy\" follows naturally from the earlier discourse on the joy of fish in the Hao River.\n\n\"With eyes, he sees eyes; with ears, he hears ears; with heart, he returns to heart\"—these are no ordinary words. Without personally entering this state, one cannot know its levelness. \"Level as a plumb line\" describes the state of absolute stillness, where the line is straight and without crookedness. \"In change, follows the course\" describes the state of responding to things. \"Follows\" means that in the interplay of events, one responds with compliance, not being disturbed by them.\n\nThe Perfected Person of old awaited all with Heaven, not imposing human will upon Heaven. Heaven is spontaneity; humanity is contrivance. The Perfected Person of old: in gaining, it is life; in losing, it is death; in gaining, it is death; in losing, it is life—like medicine.

      "translated_text": "Taking medicine as an analogy: *dong quai* and platycodon, chicken gizzard, and *shi ling* serve as sovereign, minister, assistant, and envoy in turn—where is constancy in gain or loss? Again, taking the affair of Yue as proof: Minister Zhong knew that after Yue’s fall it could be preserved, yet did not realize that in turn it would cost his own life—both are cases of gain and loss without constancy.\n\nThus it is said: The owl’s eyes have their proper use; the crane’s legs have their proper measure—severing them brings sorrow. From here, five *gu* (\"thus\") clauses further expound the meaning:\n\nThe owl’s eyes are bright at night and dim by day, each suited to its time. The crane’s legs are long or short as circumstance demands, each fitted to its measure. If severed with a blade, their life is harmed. The point is simply to follow their spontaneity.\n\nThus it is said: When wind passes, the river is diminished; when the sun passes, the river is diminished. Yet if only wind and sun were to guard the river together, the river would deem itself never disturbed—it relies on its source to flow onward. This passage returns to a more intimate point: it does not teach one to forcibly dismiss things as they arise. Rather, one must possess an inner constancy, like water with its source, to achieve this.\n\nThus water guards earth with certainty; a shadow guards its person with certainty; things guard their counterparts with certainty. This principle means that root and branch ever guard one another without separation—like water guarding earth, a shadow guarding its person, things guarding their counterparts—fixed and unchanging.\n\nThus the eye’s reliance on clarity is perilous; the ear’s reliance on acuity is perilous; the heart’s pursuit of externals is perilous. Whatever the faculty, its reliance on its storehouse is perilous. Once peril is formed, it cannot be altered. Disaster’s growth is swift and dense; its reversal depends on gradual effort; its fruition requires time. Yet people treasure these as their own jewels—is this not lamentable? Thus nations fall and peoples are slaughtered without end, yet none inquire into this.\n\nAgain, the three *dai* (\"perilous\") terms invert the earlier three *shen* (\"certain\") terms: heart, ears, and eyes—if they chase externals, they cannot remain fixed and become perilous. Expanding further, whatever one is capable of becomes harmful; the storehouse encompasses all. Once peril is formed, it cannot be altered, and disaster’s growth accelerates. To reverse peril into safety, disaster into fortune, one must follow the gradual path. Following is the work of incremental progress; even those who rigidly overcome themselves must wait long before speaking of goodness—for goodness is exceedingly difficult.\n\nYet the world indulges the desires of ears, eyes, and the heart’s cleverness as if they were treasures. In small matters, this brings ruin to the self; in great matters, it brings down nations and slaughters peoples—its calamity never ceases. Few indeed understand this inquiry.\n\nThus the foot’s contact with the ground is limited, yet it relies on what it does not tread to walk broadly. Human knowledge is scant, yet it relies on what it does not know to comprehend Heaven’s design.\n\nTo know the Great Unity, the Great Yin, the Great Eye, the Great Balance, the Great Square, the Great Faith, the Great Constancy—this is perfection. The Great Unity unites them; the Great Yin dissolves them; the Great Eye observes them; the Great Balance harmonizes them; the Great Square embodies them; the Great Faith verifies them; the Great Constancy sustains them.\n\nThere is a consummation of Heaven; there is a luminous following; there is a pivot in darkness; there is a beginning that has its counterpart. Thus, to dissolve them seems like not dissolving; to know them seems like not knowing. Only by not knowing can one come to know.\n\nThe ground the foot treads is minimal, yet what it does not tread is essential for walking. What knowledge grasps is minimal, yet what it does not grasp is the greater part. Knowing the Great Unity, the Great Yin, the Great Eye, the Great Balance, the Great Square, and the Great Faith may seem to encompass all, yet there remains an inexhaustible Heaven. One may believe they follow only what they ought, yet there is always something overseeing. One may think all is obscure, yet there is one who holds the pivot. One may think this is the beginning, yet there is always a counterpart—this counterpart then becomes the new beginning.\n\nFollowing the earlier statement that the Great Yin dissolves, this ultimate inquiry makes dissolution seem like non-dissolution, knowledge like non-knowledge. Only by not knowing can one truly know.\n\nThis inquiry cannot be bounded, yet it cannot be boundless. It is slippery yet substantial; ancient and modern do not replace it, nor can it be diminished—can this not be called the great *yanghuo*? Why then remain perplexed? To resolve confusion with non-confusion and return to non-confusion is the highest non-confusion.\n\nThe earlier passage spoke of \"not knowing to inquire,\" so here the character for \"inquiry\" is brought forward to conclude. If one inquires into this Dao, it has no bounds yet is never without bounds. What is spoken may seem like the debates of *hua* and *jian* (firmness and whiteness), yet here there is substance. All things undergo change, yet this remains unchanged and undiminished.\n\n*Yanghuo*: Xu Shen’s commentary on the *Huainanzi* states it is a term for vast numbers. The explanation is still unclear. *Yang* means to raise or proclaim; *huo* means to turn the hand repeatedly. It refers to raising and answering questions while gesturing with the hands. These two characters likely reflect contemporary colloquial usage—even today, Chan masters ascend the seat to expound the Dharma in this manner. Though the Dao’s discourse may seem divergent, it is in fact real—is this not a great proclamation? Why not inquire into this instead of remaining deluded? If one can resolve another’s confusion with one’s own non-confusion, enabling them to return to non-confusion, then perhaps all may be free from confusion. Even without an inquirer, one still hopes for someone to awaken—this is how those among the immortals direct their minds.",

      "translated_text": "The twenty-third scroll of the *Nanhua True Scripture: Following the Original Text* concludes.\nThe twenty-fourth scroll of the *Nanhua True Scripture: Following the Original Text*\nRecorded by Luoling Zhu Feng’s Luo Miandao, collated by his disciple Peng Xiang\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: Zeyang**\n\nZeyang traveled in Chu. Yi Jie spoke of him to the king, but the king did not summon him. Yi Jie returned.\n\nA man of Peng, surnamed Peng Yang, saw King Guo and said: “Why does the Master not speak of me to the king?”\nKing Guo replied: “I am not equal to Gong Yuxiu.”\nPeng Yang said: “What does Gong Yuxiu do?”\nThe king said: “In winter, he retreats alone to the river to catch turtles; in summer, he rests in the mountain thickets. If someone passes by and asks, he says: ‘This is my home.’”\n\nPeng Yang was eager for advancement, so the king used the words of a recluse to make him reflect. “If even Yi Jie is incapable, how much more so am I? I am not even Yi Jie’s equal.”\n\nNow, Yi Jie’s character was such that he lacked virtue but possessed cunning. He did not commit himself but used his connections to mystify his dealings, firmly entangled in the realm of wealth and honor. Such men do not aid others with virtue but instead consume them. Like one freezing who borrows clothes in spring, or one sweltering who turns to winter’s cold wind—so too is the King of Chu.\n\nThe King of Chu’s bearing was imposing and stern. In punishing offenses, he was as relentless as a tiger. Without a man of true virtue to correct him, who could sway him?\n\nThus, when the sage is in adversity, he makes his family forget their poverty; when he prospers, he makes kings and lords forget their ranks and emoluments, transforming them to humility. Toward things, he delights in harmony; toward people, he rejoices in their communion while preserving himself.\n\nThus, sometimes without speaking, he harmonizes others; standing beside them, he transforms them—like the natural bond between father and son. When he returns to his dwelling, he remains at ease in his conduct. His influence on others’ hearts is so distant that he says: “Wait for Gong Yuxiu.”\n\nOne who does not commit himself but mystifies his dealings humbles himself to follow others, leaving them unable to fathom his motives. The freezing man, upon meeting spring, finds clothing; the sweltering man, upon meeting a cold wind, reverts to winter. This illustrates that though the King of Chu is steeped in the pursuit of profit and desire, with proper guidance, he is easily swayed.\n\n“Flatterers” refers to men like Yi Jie; “true virtue” refers to men like Gong Yuxiu. To subdue flatterers, one uses flattery; to subdue the upright, one uses the upright Way. “Transforming to humility” means becoming humble. “Standing beside others and transforming them” means standing with them and fostering the intimacy of father and son.\n\n“Ah, that man!”—whether concealing or acting, he remains unmoved by external concerns, far removed from the common heart of profit and desire. So distant is he.\n\nThis is the meaning of “This is my home.”",
      "overlap_context": "Chan masters ascend the seat to expound the Dharma in this manner. Though the Dao’s discourse may seem divergent, it is in fact real—is this not a great proclamation? Why not inquire into this instead of remaining deluded? If one can resolve another’s confusion with one’s own non-confusion, enabling them to return to non-confusion, then perhaps all may be free from confusion. Even without an inquirer, one still hopes for someone to awaken—this is how those among the immortals direct their minds.",

Yet Confucius and his followers exhaust their thoughts, believing they have transmitted this to the lords of their age.\n\nLater, the words of the House of Rongcheng are cited: \"The reason a year is called a year is because it is named by the accumulation of three hundred and sixty days. Remove the days, and there is no year. If one can eliminate it from the subtlest stirrings of thought, then there is no burden of external names—no inner, thus no outer.\"\n\nWhen Wei Ying made a pact with Marquis Tian Mou, the latter betrayed it. Wei Ying grew enraged and was about to send an assassin. Xishou, hearing of this, found it shameful and said: \"You are a lord of ten thousand chariots, yet you would resort to the ruse of a commoner. Let me receive two hundred thousand armored troops and attack him for you. I will capture his people, seize his cattle and horses, and make his lord’s back burn with inner heat. Then I will take his state. When Ji flees, I will strike his back and break his spine.\"\n\nJizi, hearing this, found it shameful and said: \"To build a wall ten *ren* high, only to tear it down once it reaches ten *ren*—this is the toil of convict laborers. Now, for seven years, no war has arisen. This is the foundation of your rule. Xian is a troublemaker; do not listen to him.\"\n\nHuazi, hearing this, found it disgraceful and said: \"Those who speak well of attacking Qi are troublemakers; those who speak well of not attacking are also troublemakers. Those who say that both attacking and not attacking are troublemakers—*they* are troublemakers as well.\"\n\nThe lord said: \"Then what should be done?\"\nHe replied: \"Seek the Way, and that is all.\"\n\nHuizi, hearing this, went to see Dai Jinren. Jinren said: \"There is a creature called the snail—do you know it?\"\nThe lord said: \"Yes.\"\nJinren said: \"On the left horn of the snail is a state called the House of Chu; on the right horn is a state called the House of Man. They constantly fight over territory, leaving tens of thousands of corpses. After pursuing the routed army for fifteen days, they return.\"\nThe lord said: \"Alas! Is this an empty tale?\"",

Like Ran Xiangshi, who grasped the principle of its empty center, daily transforming with things yet never transformed.\n\nWould he ever abandon it?",

Yet when Historian Qiao presented the ceremonial jade, he grasped the silk and supported him with reverence. Though his arrogance was so extreme, his deference to the worthy was so solemn—this is why he was called Duke *Ling*.\"\n\nXi Wei said: \"When Duke Ling died, divination for burial in the ancestral tomb was inauspicious; divination for burial at Shaqu was auspicious.

Now, if you point to the hundred parts of a horse and cannot obtain the horse, yet the horse stands before you, it is by assembling its hundred parts that you call it a horse. Thus, hills accumulate the lowly to become high; rivers converge waters to become great; the great person unites all to become impartial. Therefore, what enters from without has a master but is not clung to; what emerges from within has a norm but is not resisted. The four seasons have distinct qi, yet Heaven does not bestow favor, and so the year is completed. The five offices have distinct duties, yet the ruler does not act for private ends, and so there is no fame. Without fame, there is non-action; with non-action, there is nothing not done. Time has endings and beginnings; the world has changes and transformations. Fortune and misfortune are substantial, yet what seems adverse may be fitting, and what is pursued may differ in outcome. Those who seek to correct may err. Compared to a great marsh, all materials find their measure; observed in a great mountain, trees and stones share the same ground. This is what is meant by 'village words.'\"\n\n\"The great person unites all to become impartial. Thus, what enters from without has a public Dao as its master and is not clung to; what emerges from within has a public Dao to align with and is not resisted.\" *\"Does not bestow favor\"* means not treating it as a personal favor. *\"Time has endings and beginnings; the world has changes and transformations\"*—one cannot cling to uniformity. *\"Substantial\"* means real. Fortune for the good and misfortune for the excessive are both real principles. What seems adverse may be fitting—like the old man who lost his horse, which may not have been misfortune. *\"Those who pursue may differ in outcome; those who seek to correct may err\"*—people each follow their private inclinations, like faces differing, and in seeking to correct, they may instead go astray.\n\nLittle Knowledge said: \"Then is this sufficient to be called the Dao?\"\n\nGreat Master Diao said: \"No. Now, the number of things is not limited to ten thousand, yet we call them 'the ten thousand things' because we use the term for the greatest number to refer to them. Thus, Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; yin and yang are the greatest of qi; the Dao is their impartiality. To use their greatness to name and refer to them is acceptable, but once a name exists, how can it be compared? If you argue thus, it is like comparing dogs and horses—how far it falls short!\"\n\n\"Once the name of the Dao exists, how can it be compared to other things? If you compare it to other things, it is like using dogs and horses as analogies—it grows ever more distant.\"\n\nLittle Knowledge said: \"Within the four directions, encompassing the six directions, where do the myriad things arise?\"\n\nGreat Master Diao said: \"Yin and yang illuminate and cover each other, govern and succeed one another; the four seasons replace, give birth to, and destroy one another. Desires and aversions, departures and approaches arise in turn. Male and female unite in pairs, and thus there is constant existence. Safety and danger alternate; fortune and misfortune give rise to one another; urgency and leisure rub against each other; gathering and scattering form completion. These are the names and realities that can be recorded, the essences that can be noted. Following the sequence of their principles, the turning of their movements, exhaustion returns to the beginning, and endings return to the start—this is what things possess, what words exhaust, what knowledge reaches, nothing more than the limits of things. The person who perceives the Dao does not follow what is abandoned, nor trace what arises—this is where discussion ceases.\"\n\n*\"Arise in turn\"* means rising prominently. *\"Unite in pairs\"* means separating and joining. *\"Essences that can be noted\"* means recording the subtle and refined. *\"What words exhaust, what knowledge reaches\"*—nothing more than the limits of things. Only the person who perceives the Dao does not follow the endings of things nor trace their beginnings, returning them to nothingness. This is why debate ceases.\n\nLittle Knowledge said: \"Ji Zhen’s 'non-action' and Jie Zi’s 'someone causes it'—which of these two theories accords with reality, and which is biased in its reasoning?\"\n\nGreat Master Diao said: \"Cocks crow and dogs bark—this is what people know. Even with great wisdom, one cannot describe in words the transformations they undergo, nor anticipate in thought what they will do. Analyzing this, the essence reaches the unparalleled, the greatness reaches the unbounded. 'Someone causes it' and 'non-action' cannot escape from things and ultimately err. *Non-action* means there is no one who acts.\"",

      "translated_text": "Mencius said: \"That which acts though nothing acts is Heaven.\" The \"someone causes it\" theory holds that something causes things to be so. Mencius said: \"Action is caused by something.\" Thus the two doctrines differ in this way. *Si* (斯) means \"to split apart.\" As the *Odes* says: \"With an axe one splits it; splitting and analyzing it, the subtle reaches the unparalleled, the great reaches the unbounded.\" What the *Odes* calls \"fur still has its patterns\" is surpassed by \"the workings of high Heaven, without sound, without scent\"—this is the ultimate. The theories of \"someone causes it\" and \"non-action\" cannot escape from things and ultimately remain flawed. \"Someone causes it\" is substantive; \"non-action\" is empty. That which has name and substance dwells among things; that which has no name and no substance resides in the emptiness of things. What can be spoken or conceived—speaking of it only increases its remoteness. What has not yet arisen cannot be feared; what has already perished cannot be obstructed. Life and death are not distant, yet their principle cannot be seen. \"Someone causes it\" and \"non-action\" are but suppositions of doubt. Observing their root, their going is without end; seeking their end, their coming is without cease. Without end, without cease—speaking of it is nothingness, sharing the principle of things. \"Someone causes it\" and \"non-action\" are the root of speech, beginning and ending with things. The Dao cannot be possessed; what is possessed cannot be without it. The name \"Dao\" is but a borrowed vehicle for its movement. \"Someone causes it\" and \"non-action\" are but partial aspects of things—how could they encompass the great square? If words suffice, then speaking all day exhausts the Dao; if words do not suffice, then speaking all day exhausts things. The Dao is the ultimate of things; speech and silence cannot contain it.

      "translated_text": "**Miscellaneous Chapters: External Things**\n\nExternal things cannot be relied upon—thus Longfeng was executed, Bi Gan slain, Jizi feigned madness, Elai put to death, and Jie and Zhou perished. No ruler fails to desire loyalty from his ministers, yet loyalty does not always earn trust. Thus Wu Yun was cast into the river, Chang Hong died in Shu, his blood concealed, and after three years transformed into jade. No parent fails to desire filial piety from their children, yet filial piety does not always bring love. Thus Xiaoji grieved and Zeng Shen mourned.\n\nWhen wood rubs against wood, it ignites; when metal is held to fire, it melts. When yin and yang clash in their courses, heaven and earth convulse in great turmoil. *Gai* (絯) means \"to bind\"—thus thunder and lightning arise, fire emerges within water, and the great locust tree is consumed. Thunder and lightning are fire within water. Fire from thunder can burn wood, yet only the locust is mentioned, for it is the wood used to kindle fire.\n\nWhen one is deeply troubled yet finds no escape, *chen* (螴) and *dun* (蜳) cannot take form. The heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth, stifled and restless, drowned and knotted. When profit and harm grind against one another, the fire they generate is extreme. The multitude burns away their harmony, and even the moon, inherently yin, cannot withstand the fire’s ascent. Thus the Way collapses utterly.\n\nThis speaks again of the fire within the human heart—how one may be deeply troubled yet find no escape, as in the earlier examples of wood rubbing wood or metal held to fire, yet ultimately unable to flee. For the heart cannot forget profit and harm. *Chen* and *dun* describe insects stirring from hibernation yet still torpid. Affairs fail to come to fruition in this way. When things do not succeed, the heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth, oppressed and agitated, submerged and bound. With these afflictions, profit and harm grind together, and the heart’s fire grows ever more intense—not merely a fleeting flame like fire in water. The multitude, burning away the harmony of their nature, turns even the moon, which belongs to yin, into fire, unable to endure its excess. The subtlety of heaven’s principle cannot withstand the blazing of human desire, and so the Way crumbles and is lost.\n\nZhuang Zhou was poor, so he went to borrow grain from the Marquis of the River.

      "translated_text": "\"I shall soon receive the gold from my fief—may I lend you three hundred pieces? Would that be acceptable?\"\n\nZhuang Zhou’s face flushed with anger as he replied: \"Yesterday, as I came, I heard a voice calling from the middle of the road. I turned to look and saw a carp in the rut of a cart wheel. I asked, 'Little carp, what brings you here?' It answered, 'I am a wave-minister of the Eastern Sea. Might you spare a dou or sheng of water to keep me alive?' I said, 'Very well. I am about to journey south to visit the kings of Wu and Yue. I shall divert the waters of the Western River to bring you home—would that do?' The carp’s face darkened with rage. 'I have lost the water that was my constant companion, my accustomed home. I have nowhere to go. A dou or sheng would be enough to keep me alive—just that much. Yet you speak as you do! You would do better to seek me now in the dried-fish market.'\"\n\nMaster Ren cast a great hook with a thick black line, baited with fifty castrated oxen, and crouched on Mount Kuaiji, casting his rod into the Eastern Sea. Day after day he fished, but for a year he caught nothing. Then a great fish took the bait, dragging the massive hook down in a plunge, thrashing its fins until white waves towered like mountains. The sea churned, its roar shaking the earth for a thousand li, as though gods and demons had been unleashed. When Master Ren landed the fish, he butchered and dried it. From the Zhe River eastward and Cangwu northward, none went unsatisfied by its flesh.\n\nYet later generations—those who weigh talent and debate men’s worth, those who recite and parrot what is already settled—all gaped in astonishment and spread the tale. But those who brandish their poles with thin lines, scurry to irrigation ditches, and watch over minnows and carp—how hard it is for them to catch a great fish! Those who adorn petty words to seek high office are as far from true attainment as the sky from the earth. Thus, one who has never heard of Master Ren’s way of life is far indeed from being fit to guide the world.\n\nThe Confucians rob graves with *Odes* and *Documents* in hand. A great Confucian calls down from above: \"Dawn breaks in the east—how goes the work?\" A lesser Confucian replies, \"The skirt and jacket are not yet removed, but there is a pearl in the mouth.\" The *Ode* says: *Green grows the wheat, / upon the mound it springs. / In life he gave no alms— / why hold a pearl in death?* They seize the corpse’s temples, press its cheeks, and with a metal mallet pry open the jaw, carefully working from the side to split the flesh without damaging the pearl in the mouth.\n\nThey even compose poems about grave-robbing Confucians, from *\"Green grows the wheat\"* to *\"Do no harm to the pearl in the river.\"* If one takes these as poems of only four lines, the rest must be the great Confucian’s instructions.\n\nA disciple of Lao Lai was gathering firewood when he encountered Confucius. Returning, he reported: \"There is a man over there—tall above, narrow below, slightly hunched, ears set back. His gaze seems fixed on the four seas. I do not know whose son he is.\" Lao Lai said, \"That is Qiu. Summon him.\" When Confucius arrived, Lao Lai said, \"Qiu, cast off your bodily pride and your cultivated knowledge—then you may be called a noble man.\" Confucius bowed and withdrew, his expression troubled. He asked, \"May I advance in my work?\" Lao Lai replied, \"To bear the wound of a single generation and yet act heedless of ten thousand generations’ peril—is this not stubborn poverty? Or have you simply failed to consider the consequences? To curry favor with delight is to court lifelong disgrace—this is but the conduct of the common crowd. Men lead one another by reputation, bind one another with obscurity. Rather than praise Yao and condemn Jie, it would be better to forget both and close the door on such judgments. To turn back is to invite harm; to act is to risk error. The sage hesitates to initiate affairs, yet each endeavor succeeds. Why, then, do you persist in your pride? Tall above’ means a long upper body; ‘narrow below’ means slender legs—said to be three inches shorter than Yu’s. ‘Slightly hunched’ means a slightly curved back. ‘Ears set back’ means they are not visible when viewed from the front. ‘Bodily pride’ is self-importance; ‘cultivated knowledge’ is polishing one’s appearance to seek recognition. ‘Heedless’ means acting without regard. ‘Heedless of ten thousand generations’ peril’ means acting as though one’s choices have no lasting consequences. ‘Stubborn’ is a turn of phrase: *Are you so stubbornly poor as to do this? Or have you simply failed to think it through?* ‘To curry favor with delight’ means flattering others to win their affection, unaware that this invites calamity for generations. Thus it is said: *To curry favor with delight is to court disaster.* Though you may see this as delight, it is lifelong disgrace—nothing more than the conduct of the common crowd, advancing no further. Men lead one another by reputation, bind one another with obscurity—nothing more.\"",

      "translated_text": "Concealment is obscurity. Confucius often praised Yao and condemned Jie, so his teaching went: *Rather than laud Yao and denounce Jie, better to forget both praise and blame—indeed, to dispense with praise altogether.* To act contrary to this principle is to invite harm; to act recklessly is to invite perversity.\n\nThe sage undertakes affairs with hesitation, as though compelled, and thus invariably succeeds. *Carrying out* means *acting.* How could it be otherwise? If one persists in such pride to the end, this is a warning against such persistence.\n\nDuke Yuan of Song dreamed in the dead of night of a man with disheveled hair peering through the side gate. Beside the gate, he said: *I come from Zailu’s deep abyss, where I am known as the Luminous One. I serve as the emissary of the Clear River to the River Lord. The fisherman Yu Qiu caught me by surprise.* The duke awoke and had the dream interpreted. The diviner said: *This is a spirit-turtle.* The duke asked: *Is there a fisherman named Yu Qiu?* His attendants replied: *There is.* The duke said: *Summon Yu Qiu to court.*\n\nThe next day, Yu Qiu appeared. The duke asked: *What did you catch?* He replied: *My net snared a white turtle, five feet in circumference.* The duke said: *Present your turtle.* When the turtle arrived, the duke wavered—first wanting to kill it, then to spare it. Unsure, he consulted the oracle, which said: *Slay the turtle for divination—it will be auspicious.* So they split the turtle open, drilling seventy-two times without a single miscast.\n\nConfucius remarked: *The spirit-turtle could appear in Duke Yuan’s dream yet could not escape Yu Qiu’s net. It could endure seventy-two divinations without error yet could not avoid the disaster of having its entrails carved out. Thus, even wisdom has its limits, and spirit its inadequacies. Though one may possess supreme knowledge, it is best to consult the many.*\n\nFish do not fear nets but fear pelicans. Discard petty cleverness, and great wisdom becomes clear; abandon contrived goodness, and true goodness arises. A newborn babe, though untaught by any master, learns to speak—simply by dwelling among those who can. Even with supreme knowledge, one does not compare to consulting the many. Fish fear pelicans, not nets—this is the fish’s ignorance. They know the pelican can harm them, yet the net comes from where they least expect. Little do they realize that the pelican’s harm is small, while the net’s is great.\n\nWhen a person discards petty cleverness, great wisdom becomes clear; when one ceases to pride oneself on goodness, true goodness arises naturally. Like a babe who learns speech without a master—simply by dwelling among speakers. Even the wise should consult the many.\n\nHui Shi said to Zhuangzi: *Your words are useless.* Zhuangzi replied: *Only when one understands uselessness can we speak of use. The earth is vast and great, yet what man uses is only enough to stand on. But if you dug beneath your feet to the Yellow Springs, would the ground still be of use?* Hui Shi said: *It would be useless.* Zhuangzi said: *Then the usefulness of the useless is clear.*\n\n*To place the feet* means *to set them down.* *To sink* means *to fall through.* Zhuangzi said: *If a man can wander freely, how could he not wander? If a man cannot wander, how could he wander at all?* Those with *drifting aspirations* and *decisive actions*—alas, are these not beyond the capacity of the supremely wise and profoundly virtuous? They plunge headlong without turning back, rush like fire without a glance behind. Though they may serve as ruler and minister for a time, when the age changes, they will no longer hold sway over one another. Thus it is said: *The perfected person does not linger in their actions.*\n\nTo honor the past and disparage the present is the way of scholars. If we observe the present age through the lens of the Xuwei clan, who could avoid being swept along? Only the perfected person can wander through the world without bias, adapting to others without losing themselves. They do not study others’ teachings, yet align with their intent without opposition.\n\n*To wander* means to float freely between heaven and earth, moving with the world without conflict. Is there one who can wander yet chooses not to? Or one who cannot wander yet does? Some can, some cannot. The following speaks of those who *drift* and *sever ties*—those who cannot wander—while the perfected person can.\n\n*Drifting aspirations* means indulging desires without restraint, forgetting to return. *Decisive actions* means acting with absolute resolve, beyond persuasion. Alas, these are not the province of the supremely wise and profoundly virtuous. For when wisdom is perfected, one does not drift; when virtue is profound, one does not sever ties. Such people, like one teetering on the edge of a precipice, do not retreat; like fire spreading unchecked, they do not look back. Though they may submit as ministers for a time, when the age changes, they no longer hold authority—all distinctions of rank vanish.\n\nHaving spoken of what is not good, let us speak of what is. Consider the ancient sage-kings like the Xuwei clan: in this present age, people follow the current, honoring their own rulers and no longer mentioning the Xuwei. Only the perfected person can bend yet wander through the world without bias or eccentricity. Though they adapt to others, they do not lose themselves. They do not study others’ teachings, yet align with their intent without opposition—like the debates of the Confucians and Mohists, following nature as though no division exists.\n\nEyes that penetrate are called *bright*; ears that penetrate are called *keen*; noses that penetrate are called *sensitive*; mouths that penetrate are called *discerning*; minds that penetrate are called *wise*; wisdom that penetrates is called *virtue.* The Dao does not tolerate blockage—blockage leads to choking, and if choking persists, it leads to trampling, from which a multitude of harms arise.\n\nLiving things rely on breath, yet if it is not abundant, it is not heaven’s fault. Heaven bores through them day and night without cease, yet man clogs their openings. *Sensitive* means *responsive.* *Penetrate* means *unobstructed.* The ears’ unobstructedness is *keenness*; the eyes’, *brightness*; the nose’s unobstructedness allows it to sense qi, causing the head to *quiver.* *Choking* means *obstructing the throat.* *Trampling* means *being trodden upon*—like feet unsteady in walking, as though trampled by others.",

      "translated_text": "The three yin meridians of the foot all originate from the toes and ascend along the throat—is this not so? Qi flows through the channels and collaterals; thus, if choking persists unchecked, it transforms into foot ailments. Once foot ailments arise, a multitude of harms follow—not merely choking and trampling.\n\nThis illustrates that the Dao must not be obstructed; obstruction breeds afflictions of this kind. *Abundant* means *flourishing*. It is further said that sentient beings rely on the free circulation of breath to sustain this body. If their breath is not flourishing, it is not heaven’s doing. Heaven bores through human orifices, and qi circulates day and night without cease. Yet man himself clogs his own apertures. *Descend* means *to sink downward*. The breath within the human body all rises from below; if it descends without ascending, death ensues. This analogy of breath serves to illustrate the heart.\n\nThe *bao* (womb/bladder) has layered chambers; the character *gen* (艮) lacks a dot, signifying that the heart possesses *heavenly wandering*. If a chamber has no emptiness, then mother and daughter-in-law quarrel within; if the heart has no heavenly wandering, then the six senses contend. The great forests and towering mountains seem virtuous to men only because their spirits are unequal to them.\n\nVirtue overflows into fame, and fame overflows into ostentation. Schemes deepen through contention; barriers arise from clinging to office. Affairs are settled by the consensus of the many. In spring’s timely rains, grasses and trees burst forth in growth, and only then do the tools of cultivation—hoes and plows—begin their work. Yet more than half of the plants that are *inverted* (planted upside down) thrive unknowingly.\n\n*Chonglang* refers to layered thresholds, like the empty spaces within the *bao*. The *bao* has layered thresholds, while the heart possesses heavenly wandering. If a chamber has no emptiness, then mother and daughter-in-law are pressed together before one’s eyes. For when a chamber has empty space, mother and daughter-in-law may dwell in ease. If the heart lacks heavenly wandering, the six senses vie for dominance. Yet if the heart has a place for natural wandering, do passions and desires not contend?\n\nLikewise, when men behold great forests and mountains and deem them virtuous, it is because their minds are narrow and their spirits cannot match them. If one’s spirit were sufficient to meet them, why would one praise them?\n\nVirtue resides within, yet fame causes it to overflow; fame itself is colorless, yet ostentation causes it to overflow. *Overflow* is like water spilling beyond its bounds. Schemes, though originally without deep calculation, grow more entrenched through the desire to entice others. *Chai* (barriers) follows the meaning of *chai zha* (palisades) from the *Nei Tian Di* chapter. It refers to the fortified posts where officials stand guard, erecting palisades for defense. Palisades do not naturally arise in official precincts; affairs are not inherently fixed but are resolved by what the multitude deems fitting—all depart from the natural.\n\nFor example, in the season of spring rains, grasses and trees naturally flourish, yet only then do men sharpen their hoes and plows, harming growth and contravening nature. *Inverted* means *reversed*. Stillness can remedy illness; *zi* (目病, eye ailments) can ease aging; tranquility can halt haste. Yet these are the concerns of the toiling, not the idle who have never inquired; they are what startle the world, yet the spirit-like man has never inquired; they are what startle the state, yet the worthy man has never inquired.\n\nIn Yanmen, when a man’s kin died, he was appointed an official for his skill in mourning. Half his fellow villagers followed his example and mourned themselves to death. *Yanmen* was the name of a village. *Official* here means *leader*.\n\nWhen Yao offered the world to Xu You, Xu You fled; when Tang offered it to Wu Guang, Wu Guang grew angry. When Ji Ta heard of this, he led his disciples to crouch by the Kuai River, and the feudal lords came to offer condolences. Three years later, Shen Tu Di drowned himself in the Yellow River.\n\nThe *quan* (basket trap) is for catching fish, yet once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten; the *ti* (snare) is for catching hares, yet once the hare is caught, the snare is forgotten; words are for conveying meaning, yet once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. Where might I find a man who has forgotten words, that I might speak with him?\n\n*The Twenty-Fifth Scroll of the Circulating Edition of the Southern Florescence True Scripture Concludes*\n*The Twenty-Sixth Scroll of the Circulating Edition of the Southern Florescence True Scripture*",

      "translated_text": "\"Strong yang\" refers to qi of the yang that is not upright.\n\nThe relationship between *wangliang* and shadow is like that of an old man to another old man. When two old men meet in this world, how much time do they have to question one another? It is but a trifling moment. Why must you ask even slightly?\n\n\"I\" refers to the shadow speaking of itself. Though I possess this shadow, I know not why it is so. Thus, one might say the shadow is born of form, like the cicada’s husk or the snake’s sloughed skin—this explanation seems so, yet is not. The husk still belongs to the cicada; the sloughed skin still belongs to the snake. But the shadow? When fire and sunlight shine upon it, it gathers. When yin and night descend, it departs. Without fire or sunlight, even with form, there can be no shadow. From this, it is clear that form, though it may give rise to my shadow, must depend on something. How much more so *wangliang*, which relies on what depends! When form comes and goes, I come and go with it. When form is strong and yang, I am strong and yang with it. Yet strong yang is not the true essence of blood and qi, and the shadow that follows it to manifest form is likewise unreal—what question is there to ask?\n\nThis passage repeats earlier words yet surpasses them in subtlety, refining the old man’s analogy. The depth of this elder’s mind is boundless; one cannot say it falls short of the Inner Chapters.\n\nYang Ziju journeyed south to Pei, while Lao Dan traveled west to Qin. They met by chance at the outskirts of Liang. Midway, Laozi looked up to the heavens and sighed, saying: \"At first, I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.\" Yang Ziju made no reply. Upon reaching their lodging, he brought water for washing, a towel and comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: \"Earlier, your disciple wished to ask you, Master, but you were walking without pause, so I dared not. Now that you have paused, I beg to know my fault.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Your haughty and overbearing demeanor—with whom could you dwell? The purest white appears tainted; the greatest virtue seems insufficient.\"\n\nYang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: \"I humbly receive your instruction.\"\n\nOn his departure, the innkeeper and his household came to greet him. The inn’s master held the mat, his wife the towel and comb; the guests stepped aside from their seats, and the cook left the hearth. On his return, the innkeeper vied with him for a seat.\n\nHaving heard Laozi’s words, Yang Ziju deeply restrained and humbled himself, withdrawing into obscurity, so that others no longer scrutinized him.\n\nNow, following Su Shi of the Eastern Slope’s interpretation, I have removed the four chapters *Yielding the Throne*, *Robber Zhi*, *Discoursing on the Sword*, and *The Old Fisherman*, and appended *Lie Yukou’s* encounter with Bohun Wuren in Qi while returning mid-journey, merging them into a single parable.\n\nSu Shi’s *Record of the Zhuangzi Shrine* states: \"One may doubt whether *Robber Zhi* and *The Old Fisherman* truly slander Confucius, while *Yielding the Throne* and *Discoursing on the Sword* are shallow and far from the Dao. Upon repeated reading, I discerned their allegorical intent, concluding with: 'Yang Ziju traveled west to Qin and met Laozi. On his departure, the innkeeper and his household came to greet him—the master held the mat, his wife the towel and comb; the guests stepped aside from their seats, and the cook left the hearth. On his return, they vied with him for a seat.' Removing the four chapters *Yielding the Throne*, *Discoursing on the Sword*, *The Old Fisherman*, and *Robber Zhi*, I merged this with *Lie Yukou’s* return mid-journey to Qi, saying: 'I was startled. I dined at ten broth-sellers’ stalls, and five served me first.' Then I understood and laughed: 'This was indeed one chapter.' Those who fail to grasp Zhuangzi’s words to the end merely splice them into his text.\"\n\nLie Yukou was traveling to Qi when he turned back midway and encountered Bohun Wuren. Bohun Wuren asked: \"Why have you returned?\"\n\nHe replied: \"I was startled.\"\n\n\"Startled by what?\"\n\n\"I once dined at ten broth-sellers’ stalls, and five served me first.\"\n\nBohun Wuren said: \"If so, why be startled?\"\n\nHe replied: \"When inner sincerity is unresolved, outward demeanor gleams with false brilliance, overawing others’ hearts, causing them to slight the venerable and esteemed and to focus on their concerns. 'Inner sincerity unresolved' means one cannot attain emptiness within. 'Outward demeanor gleams with false brilliance' means one cannot rest in tracelessness. Outwardly, one may spy and craft a radiant display, thus becoming an object of scrutiny. 'To slight the venerable and esteemed' means one does not inquire whether others possess the Dao but merely honors them for their age and seniority. *Ni* means 'fermented' or 'aged.' 'Their concerns' refer to abandoning one’s natural state to engage in external deference, which is deemed wearisome. The broth-sellers merely peddle food and surplus goods; their profit is meager, their influence slight. Yet even they act thus—how much more so the lord of ten thousand chariots? He labors for the state and exhausts his knowledge in affairs. They will entrust me with tasks and demand results. That is why I was startled.\"\n\nBohun Wuren said: \"Well observed! Now that you have settled yourself, others will protect you.\"\n\nShortly after, he went to visit, and the shoes outside the door filled the entrance. \"Protect you\" means others will gather to shelter him. The *Annals of Han* records that Xiao and Cao feared crossing the city to protect the High Ancestor—its meaning is the same.\n\nBohun Wuren stood facing north, firmly planting his staff and pressing it against his chin until his skin wrinkled. After standing for a while, he departed without a word. The attendant informed Liezi, who rushed barefoot, clutching his shoes, and reached the gate, saying: \"Master, since you have come, have you no remedy to offer?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Enough! I already told you: 'Others will protect you'—and now they do. It is not that you can make others protect you, nor can you prevent them from doing so. What use is there in this?\"",

      "translated_text": "The marvels of foreknowing arise from responsiveness. There must be a stimulus, and when shaken, one’s fundamental nature emerges. *Yu* means \"not yet.\" *Cai* may also be written as *xing* (nature). The responsiveness to what has not yet come to pass is what gives rise to the extraordinary. The verification of the multitude lies in the certainty of some stimulus, which then stirs one’s inherent nature. Yet this too is meaningless.\n\nAmong those who wander with you, none will tell you. Even those who keep your company will not inform you of this. Those who speak petty words are all poison to others. Petty words are clever, insinuating speech. When such petty words exist, they become harm to others. None awaken, none comprehend—why question one another? What is there to ask?\n\nThe cunning toil and the wise worry; the incapable seek nothing. They eat their fill and roam freely, drifting like an untethered boat, empty and wandering. There was a man of Zheng named Huan who recited and murmured in the land of Qiu. After just three years, Huan became a Confucian. His influence moistened the land for nine *li*, and his beneficence extended to his three clans, even prompting his younger brother to study Mohism.\n\nThe Confucians and Mohists debated, and their father sided with Mo Di. After ten years, Huan took his own life. In a dream, his father said to him: \"The one who made your son a Mohist was I. Why did you never once regard him favorably? Now I have become the fruit of the cypress on the grave.\" The Creator’s repayment to man does not repay the man himself but repays the Heaven within him—that which made him so. Yet man, believing himself to possess something that sets him apart from others, thereby demeans his kin.\n\nThe people of Qi who drew water from the well fought and grappled with one another. Thus it is said: All in the world today are like Huan. From this, even those with virtue find the Creator’s repayment unknowable—how much more so for those with the Dao? The ancients called this \"the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.\"\n\nMurmuring refers to recitation. \"Just three years\" means that in just three years, his Confucian studies were complete. \"The river moistens nine *li*\" is a metaphor for his beneficence extending to his three clans, meaning his official salary as a Confucian brought blessings to his lineage. \"Prompting his brother to study Mohism\" means he supported his brother in learning Mo Di’s teachings. *He* means \"why.\" *He hu* is an emphatic expression meaning \"why ever.\" In the dream, he told his father: \"The one who led your son to study Mohism was I. Yet you never once looked upon him with favor. Now I have died and become the fruit of the cypress and cedar on the grave.\"\n\nZhuangzi cited this story and concluded: The Creator’s repayment to man does not stoop to repaying what the man has done but often repays what he could not do. Huan, however, demanded repayment for his actions—this was his error. The Creator truly made his brother a Mohist, yet Huan resented it. By demeaning his kin, he was like the people of Qi who, when drawing water from the well, fought and grappled over something that belonged to no one. Those who seize and drink merely fight among themselves—this is ignorance of Heaven. All people today are like Huan.\n\nFrom this, it follows that even those with virtue find the Creator’s repayment unfathomable—how much more so for those with the Dao? Those with the Dao entrust everything to nature. The ancients called Huan’s kind \"those who flee from the punishment of Heaven.\"\n\nThe sage finds peace in what is naturally peaceful and does not seek peace in what is not; the multitude seeks peace in what is not peaceful and does not find peace in what is. These few lines suffice to convey Huan’s lack of peace.\n\nZhuangzi said: To know the Dao is easy; to refrain from speaking of it is hard. To know and not speak is to follow Heaven. To know and speak is to follow man. The ancients followed Heaven, not man.\n\nZhu Pingman studied dragon-slaying from Zhi Liyi, exhausting a thousand pieces of gold from his family. After three years, his skill was perfected, yet there was no use for his dragon-slaying craft—this too was following man.\n\nThe sage takes what must not be as what must not be, thus having no weapons. The multitude takes what must not be as what must be, thus having many weapons. Yielding to weapons, they act with ulterior motives. Weapons, when relied upon, lead to ruin—this is not following Heaven but man.\n\nThe petty man’s knowledge does not extend beyond bribes and memoranda. He exhausts his spirit in trivial and shallow matters, yet wishes to universally save the Dao and things, to unify form and emptiness. Those like this are lost in the cosmos, burdened by form and unaware of the Great Beginning.\n\n\"To universally save\" refers to the Dao and things; \"to unify\" refers to form and emptiness. It is like saying \"to achieve perfect balance.\" \"Burdened by form and unaware of the Great Beginning\" means being shackled by form and ignorant of the Great Beginning.\n\nThe perfected person returns their spirit to the beginningless and delights in deep slumber in the land of Nothing Whatever. Like water flowing without form, they release and disperse into the Great Purity. Alas! You take knowledge to reside in the tip of a hair yet do not know the great tranquility. The perfected person is like water, without intent. \"Knowledge in the tip of a hair\" is petty knowledge.\n\nThere was a man of Song named Cao Shang who was sent by the King of Song as an envoy to Qin. On his departure, he obtained several carriages. The king was pleased with him and added a hundred more carriages. Upon returning to Song, he saw Zhuangzi and said: \"Living in a cramped alley, impoverished and weaving sandals, with a withered neck and sallow face—this was my shortcoming. But to awaken a ruler of ten thousand chariots and follow him with a hundred carriages—this is my strength.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: The King of Qin had an illness and summoned physicians. Those who lanced boils and drained abscesses received one carriage; those who licked his hemorrhoids received five carriages. The lower the treatment, the more carriages they received. Did you perhaps treat his hemorrhoids? Why else would you receive so many carriages? Be on your way!",

      "translated_text": "Duke Ai of Lu asked Yan He, saying: \"I take Zhongni as the pillar of the state—will the kingdom then recover?\"\n\nYan He replied: \"Perilous indeed! It teeters on the brink.\n\n\"Zhongni adorns feathers to make patterns—patterns, pronounced *hua*, meaning ornate embellishments—adorns feathers to create such ornamentation. He busies himself with florid rhetoric, taking branch for root, spinning fragmented theories. He hardens his nature to display it to the people, yet does not know his own lack of sincerity. He receives it in the heart and governs it with the spirit—how could this suffice to lead the people? Man is born receiving this heart, with the spirit as its natural master. Yet Zhongni forcibly seeks to control it—how could this suffice to govern the people? *Fu* refers to Zhongni.\n\n\"Those people—you and I—ought to let them be, guided only by our bearing. Even if there are errors, it would suffice. Now you cause the people to abandon substance and learn falsity—this is no way to lead them. *Bi* refers to the people; *ru* to you, Duke; *yu* to myself, Yan He. *Yi* means direction, as in a nod or gesture. *Wu* means error. The people should be left to forget themselves; you and I need only guide them with our bearing—why impose governance? Though there may be some mistakes, it is better than forcing them into falsity.\n\n\"Considering the future, it would be better to cease. The state is difficult to govern. What is bestowed upon men yet not forgotten is not the natural dispensation of Heaven. If you take Zhongni as the pillar, you plan for future generations—better to desist, for the kingdom is hard to rule. What is given to men yet cannot be forgotten is not a natural bestowal.\n\n\"Merchants are not ranked among the gentry. Though circumstances may occasionally place them there, the spirit does not accept it. The heart does not wish to rank them so—*chi* means to rank. Yan He’s displeasure with Zhongni is thus.\n\n\"External punishments are meted out by metal and wood; internal punishments arise from movement and transgression. When petty men incur external punishments, metal and wood interrogate them; when they incur internal punishments, yin and yang consume them. Only the true person can escape both inner and outer punishments.\" Here Yan He expounds the Way of the true person, drawing a clear distinction from Zhongni.\n\nConfucius said: \"The human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to know than Heaven. Heaven has its seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer—and its fixed times of day and night. But man has a thick façade and deep emotions. Thus, some appear honest yet seek gain; some seem incapable yet possess talent; some are compliant yet sharp, or stubborn yet yielding; some are slow yet severe. *Hu* is read as *han*, *gan*—though firm, they are circuitous; though unhurried, they are harsh. Therefore, those who rush to righteousness as if parched may flee from it as if burned.\"",

      "translated_text": "No greater thief exists than virtue held with intent, and intent with an eye—once it has an eye, it turns inward; turning inward, it is undone. Five baleful virtues exist, and the central virtue is chief among them.\n\nWhat is the central virtue? The central virtue is one who takes self-satisfaction and reviles those who do not act as they do. The desires of the ear, eye, nose, mouth, and heart—these five are all baleful virtues, yet the heart’s desire, being central, is the chief of baleful virtues. Whoever takes self-satisfaction and reviles others for not doing as they do—this is baleful virtue.\n\nPoverty has eight extremes; success has three certainties. The two—poverty and success—are expounded below. \"Certainties\" means inevitabilities.\n\nThe body has six receptacles. Beauty, whiskers, height, stature, strength, splendor, courage, and boldness—these eight surpass others, yet by these one is impoverished. (Beauty and whiskers, height and stature are one; strength and splendor, courage and boldness are one. When Viscount Xiang of Zhao deemed a man with fine whiskers and great stature worthy, or one skilled in archery and charioteering worthy, these too were two matters.) Combining the six receptacles into eight, one is impoverished by what surpasses others—this further explains the eight extremes of poverty.\n\nCompliance, ease, and humility—these three all lead to success. Compliance means following the natural course; ease means acting with self-possession; humility means falling short of others through timidity and fear. These three do not seek success, yet success comes of itself—this explains the three certainties of success.\n\nWisdom that extends outward brings resentment when boldness stirs; benevolence and righteousness bring reproach. Only one who grasps the essence of life acts with towering self-assurance. One who grasps knowledge, though not reaching this, may still resemble it. One who grasps the great mandate of Heaven moves in accord with it; one who grasps the lesser mandate, though unable to match this, may still accept what befalls them. What is called success does not lie in acting outwardly.\n\nA man who had an audience with the King of Song was granted ten carriages. With these ten carriages, he grew arrogant toward Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi said: By the river lived a poor family who wove rushes to eat. Their son dived into the depths and obtained a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. His father said to him: Bring a stone to smash it! For a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces must lie in the ninefold abyss beneath the chin of a black dragon. That you could obtain it means you encountered its sleep. Had the black dragon awakened, what trace of you would remain?\n\nNow the depths of the state of Song are not merely a ninefold abyss; the King of Song is not merely a black dragon. That you could obtain the carriages means you encountered his sleep. Had the King of Song awakened, you would be reduced to dust.\n\nArrogance means haughty condescension, treating others as children. Weaving rushes means crafting implements from grass. \"What trace would remain?\" means the dragon would devour him, leaving nothing.\n\nSomeone sent an envoy to Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi replied to the messenger: Have you seen the sacrificial ox? It is clothed in embroidered silk and fed with fine grain. Yet when it is led into the great temple, though it might wish to be a lone calf, can it be so?\n\nAs Zhuangzi neared death, his disciples wished to give him a lavish burial. Zhuangzi said: I take heaven and earth as my inner and outer coffins, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars as my pearls, and the ten thousand things as my funeral gifts. Are my burial furnishings not complete? What could be added to this?\n\nHis disciples said: We fear the crows and kites will eat you.\n\nZhuangzi said: Above, I would be eaten by crows and kites; below, by ants and mole crickets. To take from one to give to the other—how partial is that!\n\nTo level with the uneven is to fail in leveling; to verify with the unverifiable is to fail in verification. Only the enlightened act, and the spiritually attuned verify. That the enlightened cannot surpass the spiritually attuned has long been so. Yet fools rely on what they see to impose upon others—this external effort is truly lamentable.\n\n*Verification* means proof.\n\n*Following the Original Text of the Southern Florescence True Scripture*, Scroll 26\n(Note: The character \"门\" in the original was emended to \"问\" following the received text.)\n(Note: The character \"汝\" was added following the received text.)\n\n*Following the Original Text of the Southern Florescence True Scripture*, Scroll 27\nRecorded by Luo Miandao of Luling Bamboo Peak; collated by disciple Peng Xiang.",

      "translated_text": "The world abounds with those who practice the arts of governance—each deeming their methods unsurpassable. These are the *arts of branches*, where each clings to what they possess, believing none can exceed them.\n\nWhat was called the *Dao-arts* in antiquity—the arts of the Way—transcends these branch-arts. Where, then, does it reside? It is nowhere absent. How does the spirit descend? How does clarity emerge? The sage is born of it, the king is perfected by it—all trace back to the One, the Great Ultimate.\n\nUnsevered from the Source, one is a *Heavenly Person*; unsevered from essence, a *Spiritual Person*; unsevered from truth, a *Perfected Person*. Taking Heaven as their source, virtue as their root, and the Dao as their gate—this encompasses the Heavenly, Spiritual, and Perfected Persons.\n\nManifesting through transformation, one is a *sage*. Taking benevolence as grace, righteousness as principle, ritual as conduct, and music as harmony—this defines the sage. Radiant with compassion, one is a *noble person*. Taking law as division, names as standards, deeds as proof, and scrutiny as judgment—counting one, two, three, four—officials rank themselves thus. Taking duty as constant, sustenance as primary, fostering growth, storing provisions, caring for the aged, weak, orphaned, and widowed—this is the governance of the people. This describes the ranking of noble persons.\n\nFrom the Heavenly Person to the noble person, the Dao-arts of antiquity are fully encompassed. Yet what follows laments the divergence of past and present.\n\nThe ancients were complete: they matched the spirit’s brightness, harmonized with Heaven and Earth, nurtured the myriad things, brought concord to the world, and extended blessings to the people. They understood the fundamental principles and adhered to their applications, their influence pervading all—great and small, refined and coarse—with no place untouched.\n\nWhere their clarity was bound to measures and degrees, remnants of old laws and transmitted histories still endure. In the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, scholars of Zou and Lu, and the gentry, often elucidate them. The *Odes* convey intent, the *Documents* convey affairs, the *Rites* convey conduct, the *Music* conveys harmony, the *Changes* convey yin and yang, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* convey names and duties. These principles, scattered across the world and established in the Central States, are sometimes praised and expounded by the Hundred Schools.\n\nThis describes the Dao-arts of antiquity, encompassing Fuxi, Shennong, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Kings Wen and Wu, the Zhou, and Confucius. Yet when the world fell into great disorder, worthies and sages lost their clarity, and the Dao and virtue diverged. The world grasped at partial insights, each prizing their own. Like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth—each has its clarity but cannot communicate—so too the Hundred Schools’ arts each have their strengths and occasional uses. Yet they are incomplete, partial—scholars of a single corner.\n\nThey dissect the beauty of Heaven and Earth, analyze the principles of the myriad things, and examine the wholeness of the ancients. Few can fully embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the countenance of the spirit’s brightness. Thus, the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship dimmed and remained unexpressed, and the world’s people each pursued their desires, crafting their own methods. How lamentable!\n\nThe Hundred Schools departed and did not return—they will never reunite. Later scholars, unfortunate to have missed the purity of Heaven and Earth and the greatness of the ancients, saw the Dao-arts torn asunder by the world.\n\nThe world’s great disorder stems from partial insights—each grasping one aspect and delighting in their own bias. Like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth, each has its knowledge but cannot communicate. The Hundred Schools’ arts each have their strengths and occasional uses, yet they cling to partiality. Few, in examining the ancients’ wholeness, can fully embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the spirit’s countenance. Each crafts their own methods—how lamentable!\n\nNot indulging in later ages, not lavishing on the myriad things, not flaunting measures and degrees, but using the carpenter’s line to correct themselves and prepare for the world’s urgencies: this was a path within the ancient Dao-arts. Mo Di and Qin Guli heard its teachings and rejoiced in them. They overemphasized it, yet followed it to excess.\n\nThey composed the *Against Music*, calling it *Frugality*; they forbade singing in life and mourning in death. Such was the ancient Dao-arts, yet Mo Di’s followers alone delighted in these teachings, carrying them to extremes.",

      "translated_text": "Those who correct themselves with the carpenter’s line do so to an extreme degree. Their insistence on neither extravagance nor ostentation, neither excess nor display, is itself an extreme of compliance. In composing *Against Music*, they declare all their undertakings to be devoid of joy. Mozi advocated universal love and mutual benefit while opposing strife, and his Way forbade anger. He was diligent in study and broad in learning, yet neither aligned with the ancients nor diverged from the common crowd—his path neither matched the ancient kings’ nor differed from the multitude’s. He condemned the rites and music of antiquity: the Yellow Emperor had *Xianchi*, Yao had *Dazhang*, Shun had *Dashao*, Yu had *Daxia*, Tang had *Dahu*, King Wen had the music of the *Biyong* academy, and King Wu and the Duke of Zhou composed *Wu*—these were the music of old. In ancient funeral rites, noble and base had their proper forms, high and low their distinctions. The Son of Heaven was buried in seven layers of inner and outer coffins, the feudal lords in five, ministers in three, and scholars in two—these were the rites of old. Yet Mozi alone forbade singing in life and mourning attire in death, prescribing only a paulownia coffin three inches thick with no outer casket as the model. Teaching others thus, he showed no love for them; practicing it himself, he showed no love for himself. Though his Way had not yet failed, instructing others in meagerness was hardly a way to love them. Yet in his own conduct, he embraced meagerness, surely showing no love for himself. Thus, none could fault him, and his Way did not collapse.\n\nNevertheless, to sing yet condemn singing, to weep yet condemn weeping, to rejoice yet condemn rejoicing—is this truly fitting? Though what follows are Zhuangzi’s critical remarks: to refrain from singing when one ought to sing, to refrain from weeping when one ought to weep, to refrain from joy when one ought to rejoice—does this accord with human nature? His life was one of toil, his death one of meagerness; his Way was stark and unadorned, causing others sorrow and grief. His conduct was difficult to emulate. I fear it cannot be the Way of the sage, for it runs counter to the hearts of all under Heaven. The world cannot endure it. Though Mozi alone could bear it, what could he do for all under Heaven? Estranged from the world, he was far from the kingship of old. This is how he diverged from the ancient kings.\n\nMozi spoke of the Way, saying: \"In ancient times, Yu dammed the floods, dredged the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and opened the roads to the four barbarians and the nine provinces. There were three hundred great rivers, three thousand tributaries, and countless smaller streams. Yu personally wielded the basket and spade, the tools for carrying food and clothing, and dredged the myriad rivers of the world. His calves bore no flesh, his shins no hair; he bathed in harsh rains, combed through fierce winds, and established the ten thousand states. Yu was a great sage, yet he wearied his body for all under Heaven to such an extent. Thus, later Mohists wore coarse garments of fur and hemp, bound their feet in rough sandals, labored day and night without rest, and took self-imposed hardship as their ultimate principle, saying: 'Without this, one cannot follow Yu’s Way and is unworthy of being called a Mohist.'\"\n\nXiangli Qin’s disciples, such as Xiangli (a surname), Qin (a given name), and the followers of the Five Lords (the five ranks of feudal lords, as in the *Zuozhuan*),...",

      "translated_text": "The southern Mohists—Ku Huo, Ji Chi, Deng Lingzi, and their ilk—all recited the *Mo Jing* yet diverged in their interpretations, calling themselves \"separate Mohists\" of distinct lineages. They engaged in debates over the \"hard and white\" and \"same and different,\" responding to one another with asymmetrical, unorthodox arguments—neither clashing nor contradicting, yet aligning in their discourse. They revered the *Juzi* as sages, each aspiring to serve as their proxy, hoping to become their successors. This dispute remains unresolved to this day.\n\nThe *Juzi*—akin to \"great ones\"—were chosen from the most eminent of their faction as sages. To serve as their proxy (*shi*, \"master\") was to become the lineage’s standard-bearer. Yet while some believed in this, others did not, and the debate has never been settled. Mo Di and Qin Guli’s intentions were sound, but their methods were flawed. They would have later Mohists vie in self-imposed hardship, boasting of calves without flesh and shins without hair. This is the height of chaos, the nadir of order—where disorder abounds and governance is scarce. Nevertheless, Mozi was truly one who loved the world and sought its betterment. Even if one were to seek such a figure in vain, they would persist, undeterred by emaciation—a true talent indeed. Unburdened by convention, unadorned by material things, uncompromising with others, and unyielding to the crowd, he desired the world’s peace to preserve the lives of the people. His own sustenance and that of others were to be met in full measure, and no more—thus baring his heart to make its purity known.\n\nAmong the ancient arts of the Dao, some resided in this approach. Song Xing and Yin Wen, hearing of its influence, were delighted. They crafted the \"Mount Hua cap\" as their emblem—its shape flat above and below, symbolizing balance. They engaged with all things by first distinguishing right from wrong, for bias obscures judgment. They spoke of the heart’s capacity, naming it \"the heart’s conduct.\" Through harmony, they sought to unite the world, proposing to establish it as the guiding principle. To describe the heart’s capacity was to depict its form; to name it was to define its function. *Er* (cooking to tenderness) was likened to fostering harmony, as one might prepare a feast to bring joy, thereby pacifying the realm. They urged that this principle be made the master of all.\n\nUnmoved by insult, they sought to quell strife and end warfare, rescuing the people from conflict. With this, they traversed the world, persuading rulers above and instructing the masses below. Though the world rejected them, they persisted, clamoring without cease—thus, though reviled above and below, they forced their presence. Yet their concern for others was vast, while their self-regard was minimal. They declared: \"Five *sheng* of rice suffice. The master may fear hunger, but though disciples starve, they never forget the world, laboring day and night without rest. They say: 'We must surely bring life to all!'\"",

To deem something of no benefit to the world is to make clear that it is not as good as oneself.\" They took the prohibition of attack and cessation of warfare as external matters, and the restraint of passions and desires as internal. Whether great or small, refined or coarse, their conduct extended precisely to this point and no further. Though their learning differed in scale and depth, their conduct sufficed to reach this end. Thus, their words held no distinction of great or small, high or deep.\n\nImpartial yet not partisan, level and without bias, detached and without fixed intent, they followed things without duality, unburdened by deliberation, unguided by cunning. Toward things, they made no selection, but went along with them. \"Level\" means even and unobstructed. \"Detached and without fixed intent\" means meeting affairs with decisive action, without preconceived notions. \"Following things without duality\" means responding to matters without divided intentions. For instance, if one were engaged in a task and another generated a separate intention, this would be a sign of contrivance.\n\nAmong the ancient arts of the Dao, there were those who practiced this way. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard of its influence and delighted in it. They took the equalization of the myriad things as their foremost principle, saying: \"Heaven can cover them but cannot bear them; earth can bear them but cannot cover them; the great Dao can encompass them but cannot discriminate among them. Know that the myriad things all have what is acceptable and what is not.\"\n\nThus they said: \"Selection is not comprehensive; teaching does not reach all; only the Dao leaves nothing out.\" Therefore, Shen Dao abandoned knowledge and relinquished the self, acting only out of necessity. He was unencumbered by things, taking this as the principle of the Dao. He said: \"To know yet feign ignorance is to approach knowledge only to be harmed by its proximity.\" If one makes selections, they will not be comprehensive; if one uses this as teaching, it will not reach all. Only by returning to the Dao can nothing be lost.\n\n\"Unencumbered\" (*ling*) means clarity and coolness; \"detached\" (*tai*) means purification and cleansing. To be \"unencumbered and detached by things\" is to act with ease in all affairs. \"To know yet feign ignorance\" means that though one knows, one acts as if one does not. Both \"approach\" (*bo*) and \"proximity\" (*lin*) imply slightness—if one has even a slight knowledge, one will inevitably suffer slight harm.\n\nPeng Meng, Tian Pian, Shen Dao, Hui Shi, and Deng Xi were all contemporaries of King Xuan of Qi, residing at Jixia. Their learning was rooted in the Huang-Lao tradition.

To \"hammer\" is to strike, to \"sever\" is to cut, yet both yield without resistance. Abandoning right and wrong, one may thus avoid entanglement.\n\nWithout reliance on wisdom or foresight, unaware of what lies ahead or behind, one stands towering and alone. Pushing others to turn back before proceeding, dragging one’s steps before advancing—like the swirling return of a whirlwind, the circling of a feather, the grinding of a millstone in its groove—one remains whole without fault, moving or still without transgression, never incurring blame.\n\nThe whirlwind’s return, the feather’s circling—both suggest yielding. The millstone’s groove, too, turns and emerges without resistance. Why is this so? For things devoid of knowledge bear no burden of self-assertion, no encumbrance of cleverness; their movement and stillness never depart from principle, and thus they pass their lives without praise.\n\nThus it is said: \"Attain the state of things without knowledge, and the worthies and sages become superfluous.\" A clod of earth does not lose the Dao.\n\nThe heroic and eminent mocked him, saying: \"Shen Dao’s Way is not the conduct of the living but the principle of the dead.\" They found it merely strange.\n\nA clod, devoid of knowledge, does not lose the Dao. Yet the heroic and eminent laughed among themselves: \"What Shen Dao practices is not the way of the living but the principle of the dead.\" They could only marvel in bewilderment.\n\nTian Pian was the same, having studied under Peng Meng and received the teaching of \"no-teaching.\" Peng Meng’s master said: \"The ancient Dao reaches the point where nothing is affirmed, nothing denied.\" Its manner was utterly still (*kuòrán*), beyond all description.\n\nYet even so, he could not escape the fate of being \"cut off like a turtle\" (*yuán duàn*). What he called the Dao was not the Dao, and what he spoke as right was not free from wrong.\n\nPeng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not understand the Dao. Nevertheless, in broad terms, they had once glimpsed something of it.\n\n\"Tian Pian was the same\" means he was like Shen Dao. Peng Meng was Tian Pian’s teacher. Tian Pian studied under Peng Meng and received the teaching of \"no words.\" Peng Meng’s master had said: \"The ancient Dao reaches the point where nothing is affirmed, nothing denied.\" Its manner was so obscure (*lùwǎngrán*) as to be inexpressible, and thus Peng Meng, too, remained silent.\n\nYet when Tian Pian returned from Peng Meng’s house, after some time, people no longer gathered to watch—though a few still came, like fish breaking the surface in scattered succession. Though his words did not astonish, some still recognized him.\n\nFrom this, we may conclude: what Tian Pian called the Dao was not the Dao, and even if his words were right, they were not free from wrong.\n\nZhuangzi assessed them, saying: \"Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao cannot be credited with understanding the Dao, yet viewed broadly, they had once heard something of it.\"\n\nZhuangzi, taking Lao Dan as one who understood the Dao, thus compared them to this passage. \"Taking the root as essential, the material as coarse; regarding accumulation as insufficiency, one dwells in serene solitude with the spirit luminaries.\"\n\nAmong the ancient arts of the Dao, there were those who embodied this. Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of their manner and delighted in it. They established it upon the constancy of \"non-being\" (*wúyǒu*) and centered it in the Great One (*Tàiyī*). They took gentleness, weakness, and humility as its outward form, and emptiness, non-destruction of the myriad things as its substance.\n\nGuan Yin said: \"Within oneself, hold no fixed position, and the forms of things will manifest of themselves. In movement, be like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. Fading like vanishing, silent like purity—harmonizing with those who are alike, giving life to those who attain it. Never preceding others, always following them.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Know the masculine, keep to the feminine, and be the world’s stream. Know the bright, keep to the obscure, and be the world’s valley.\" (Obscurity here means darkness; streams and valleys are empty yet capacious places—metaphors for the Mysterious Female (*Xuán Pìn*).)\n\n\"While others seek to be first, I alone take the rear,\" he said. \"I bear the world’s filth. While others seek fullness, I alone take emptiness. Without hoarding, I have abundance—abundance in tranquility. In conducting myself, I am unhurried and unburdened, acting without contrivance and laughing at others’ cleverness.\n\nWhile others seek fortune, I alone seek to bend and preserve wholeness, saying: 'Let me merely avoid blame.' Taking depth as my root, frugality as my guiding principle, I say: 'What is rigid will break; what is sharp will be blunted.' Always yielding to things, never cutting others down—this may be called the ultimate attainment.\n\nAh, Guan Yin and Lao Dan! Were they not the vast and true persons of antiquity? Silent and formless, their transformations without constancy—do they belong to death or life? Do they stand with heaven and earth?\"",

      "translated_text": "Where does the spirit’s radiance go? Vast and boundless—whither does it drift? Sudden and fleeting—where does it alight? All things are gathered within it, yet none can claim it as their home.\n\nAmong the ancient arts of the Dao, there was one that dwelt herein. Zhuang Zhou heard its wind and delighted in it. With meandering discourse, wild and unbounded words, and speech without beginning or end, he gave free rein to his thoughts without constraint, refusing to be confined by partial views—meaning he would not be limited to a single perspective. He saw the world as sunk in turbidity, unfit for solemn speech or direct instruction. Thus, he used *zhi*-words to weave expansive tales, *zhong*-words to affirm truth, and *yu*-words to broaden his reach. Alone, he roamed with the spirit of heaven and earth, yet did not scorn or detach from the myriad things. He did not dispute right or wrong, but dwelt among the common world.\n\nThough his writings were grand and wondrous, their flow was harmonious and unmarred. Though his words were uneven and strange, they were striking to behold. Zhuangzi himself marveled at his own prose. His fullness could not be contained. Above, he wandered with the Creator; below, he befriended those beyond life and death, without beginning or end. In his grasp of the root, he was vast and expansive, profound and unrestrained. In his reverence for the source, he attained perfect harmony and ascended to the heights—this source being the unbroken lineage of the Dao.\n\nYet though he responded to transformation and dissolved the constraints of things, his principles were inexhaustible, his insights unchanging. Vague and obscure, they remained unfathomed.\n\nZhuangzi followed the teachings of Lao Dan. Since Lao Dan had already been praised as a vast and true person, what more could Zhuangzi add? Thus, the final passage merely addresses his writings.\n\nHui Shi was a man of many methods—contemporary with Zhuangzi as minister of Liang. While earlier passages spoke of the arts of the Dao, here alone they speak of \"many methods,\" referring to the arts of disputation. His writings filled five carts; his doctrines were contradictory and discordant; his words did not strike the mark.\n\nIn his *Discourse on Things*, he said: \"That which is greatest, having no outside, is called the Great One; that which is smallest, having no inside, is called the Small One. What has no thickness cannot be accumulated, yet it may extend a thousand *li*. The sky and earth are level; mountains and marshes are flat. The sun is at its zenith even as it declines; things are born even as they die. If great things are the same while small things differ, this is called the lesser sameness and difference. If all things are entirely the same or entirely different, this is called the greater sameness and difference.\"\n\nHis words did not align with reason, yet he proceeded to ponder the nature of things. He said: \"What has no thickness cannot be accumulated, yet its greatness may span a thousand *li*—for from the infinitesimal, accumulation may reach vastness. As for the sun’s decline, it may be observed aslant. The sky and earth, mountains and marshes—all share in the sun’s ascent and descent. The birth and death of things are likewise united in sameness. If great things are alike while small things differ, this is the lesser sameness and difference. If all things are entirely the same or entirely different, this is the greater sameness and difference.\"\n\n\"The south is both boundless and bounded. Today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday. Linked rings can be unlinked. I know the center of the world—it lies north of Yan and south of Yue. Embracing all things with universal love, heaven and earth become one body.\"\n\nHui Shi took this as his great principle, surveying the world to enlighten its debaters. The debaters of the world rejoiced in his company.\n\nThose who dwell in the north know nothing of the south’s geography and deem it boundless—yet in truth, it has limits. Though one may set out for Yue today, upon arrival, it is as if one had come yesterday. The center of the world is unknowable—yet the people of Yan and Yue each take their own land as the center, so the north of Yan and the south of Yue may also be deemed the center. To embrace all things with universal love is to make heaven and earth one body with oneself.\n\nEggs have feathers. A chicken has three feet. Ying possesses all under heaven. A dog can be a sheep. Horses lay eggs. A tadpole has a tail.",
      "overlap_context": "end and preserve wholeness, saying: 'Let me merely avoid blame.' Taking depth as my root, frugality as my guiding principle, I say: 'What is rigid will break; what is sharp will be blunted.' Always yielding to things, never cutting others down—this may be called the ultimate attainment.\n\nAh, Guan Yin and Lao Dan! Were they not the vast and true persons of antiquity? Silent and formless, their transformations without constancy—do they belong to death or life? Do they stand with heaven and earth?\"",

      "translated_text": "Fire is not hot. Mountains speak. Wheels do not touch the ground. Eyes do not see. The finger does not reach, and what reaches does not persist. A tortoise is longer than a snake. The carpenter’s square is not square; the compass cannot draw a circle. The socket does not encircle the tenon. The shadow of a flying bird never moves. The swiftness of an arrow’s flight includes moments of neither motion nor rest. A dog is not a hound. A yellow horse and a black ox make three. A white dog is black. A lone colt has never had a mother. If you take half of a one-foot staff each day, it will never be exhausted for ten thousand generations.\n\nDebaters used these propositions to engage with Hui Shi, and their exchanges continued endlessly. This passage records several such paradoxes of the time.\n\nFeathers grow within the egg—hence, \"eggs have feathers.\" A pheasant has two feet, but the intent behind its movement counts as a third—hence, \"a chicken has three feet.\" Ying was originally a state ruled by a marquis, yet it was called a kingdom—hence, \"Ying possesses all under heaven.\" The names of large and small sheep are assigned by people; if one first names a dog as a sheep, then people will call it a sheep. Horses are certainly born from the womb, yet since a foal is covered in hair at birth, how is it different from being born from an egg? Not only do creatures have tails—observe the characters for \"hook\" (钩), \"ding\" (丁), and \"child\" (子), all of which resemble tails. Xunzi also said, \"Hooks have bristles; eggs have feathers\"—these are difficult claims to uphold. Yet Deng Xi and Hui Shi could defend them. The commentary explains: \"Hooks having bristles\" is akin to \"a tadpole having a tail,\" for the curved part of *ding* (丁) forms a hook, and bristles resemble tails.\n\nFire is hot, yet in winter it is not. Mountains are still, yet an echo in an empty valley makes them \"speak.\" A perfectly round wheel does not touch the ground. The *Kao Gong Ji* states of wheelwrights: \"When inspecting a wheel, one desires it to be so smooth that no part stands out—this is the essence of roundness.\" Eyes may be obstructed and thus fail to see; a finger may miss its target and thus fail to reach. Even a straight path cannot be fully traversed. Snakes are long, yet tortoises are short—but since tortoises can foretell fortune, they are \"longer\" than snakes. The carpenter’s square is a tool for making right angles, yet its own form is not perfectly square. The compass is a tool for drawing circles, yet its own form cannot create a perfect circle. The socket is not designed to encircle the tenon—rather, the tenon fits into it. Though the shadow of a flying bird appears to move, it merely clings to the bird’s form and does not separate from it—hence, it \"never moves.\" Though an arrow flies swiftly, if it is not loosed, it does not move; once loosed, it cannot be stopped—thus, its swiftness lies in the archer, not the arrow itself.\n\nA dog and a hound are the same, yet one with dewclaws is called a *hound*, while one without is merely a *dog* and cannot be called a hound. A horse is one, yet there is also the category of \"yellow\"—that makes two. If the horse is inherently yellow, and people call it so, does that not make three? The same applies to a black ox. A black dog cannot become white, but a white dog can be dyed black—thus, one may say a dog can be called a \"black colt.\" Yet to say a \"lone colt\" implies it never had a mother—is this acceptable? A one-foot staff is not long, yet if you use half of it today and half of the remainder tomorrow, repeating this endlessly, it will never be exhausted for ten thousand generations.\n\nDebaters of the time used such arguments to engage with Hui Shi, their exchanges continuing without end. Huan Tuan, Gongsun Long, and their ilk—these sophists—distorted people’s minds and altered their intentions. They could triumph in verbal sparring but could not win over hearts; such was the confinement of the debaters. Hui Shi daily matched wits with others, setting himself apart from the world’s debaters with his strangeness—this was his root. Yet in his oral disputations, he considered himself the most worthy, declaring: \"Are not heaven and earth grand? I, Hui, possess a heroic spirit but lack the method.\" The confinement of the debaters refers to how none could escape the bounds of their own arguments. Ordinary debaters are common people; the world’s debaters transcend the ordinary, like those called the \"worthies of the world.\"\n\nThe root here means foundation. Hui Shi daily engaged in debate with ordinary people, but when he suddenly confronted Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long, he was pitted against the world’s debaters—was this not strange? His position was like the tangled roots of a tree, difficult to uproot. Yet in his speech, he boasted: \"Is my strength not like that of heaven and earth? How could others surpass heaven and earth?\" Such was his delusion. Though Hui Shi harbored a competitive spirit, he lacked the means to prevail. He began with many methods but ended with none—thus, he had neither method nor principle.\n\nIn the south there was a man of extraordinary talent named Huang Liao, who asked why heaven and earth do not collapse, and the causes of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. Hui Shi did not decline to answer nor pause to reflect but expounded on all things without end. Though his explanations were exhaustive, he still deemed them insufficient and added ever more bizarre claims, taking contrarian positions as truth and seeking fame through victory—thus, he found no harmony with others. Weak in virtue yet strong in disputation, his path was tortuous. \"Weak in virtue\" means deficient in moral power; \"strong in disputation\" means excessive in argumentation. *Tu* means path; *yu* means winding. Hui Shi’s way was circuitous and crooked.\n\nViewing Hui Shi’s abilities through the Dao of heaven and earth, he was like the labor of a single mosquito or gnat—what use was he to the world? Even if one’s partial theories were sound, to claim they were the most esteemed Dao would be perilous. Hui Shi could not find peace in this, scattering his efforts across all things without satisfaction, seeking only fame as a skilled debater. He could not settle into unity but instead sought to encompass all things, flaunting his ability.",

      "translated_text": "Cultivating Sincerity and Restoring Nature are shallow and clumsy. The four chapters beginning with *Yielding the Throne* are coarse and harsh. These are not the authentic words of Zhuangzi; they are rejected and appended to the end of the scroll.\n\nThose who *cultivate sincerity* exalt conduct, distancing themselves from the world and defying custom, their lofty discourses filled with resentment and reproach—this is but obstinacy. Such are the preferences of recluses in the mountains and valleys, men who are not of this world, those who delight in withering away or plunging into the abyss. Those who speak of benevolence and righteousness, loyalty and trust, reverence and frugality, deference and yielding—this is but refinement. Such are the preferences of gentlemen in peaceful times, teachers and admonishers, those who roam and dwell in the love of learning. Those who speak of great achievements, establishing great renown, honoring ruler and subject, rectifying high and low—this is but governance. Such are the preferences of courtiers, men who exalt their lord and strengthen the state, those who seek merit and annexation. Those who retreat to marshes and wilds, dwelling in seclusion, fishing and living idly—this is but inaction. Such are the preferences of men of rivers and seas, those who shun the world, those who delight in leisure. Those who practice breath control, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, imitating the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching—this is but longevity. Such are the preferences of practitioners of Daoist arts, those who nurture the body, those who seek the long life of Peng Zu.\n\nYet there are those who attain loftiness without cultivating sincerity, refinement without benevolence and righteousness, governance without merit and fame, seclusion without rivers and seas, longevity without Daoist arts. They forget nothing, yet possess all. Serene and boundless, all beauties follow them. This is the Way of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the Sage.\n\nThus it is said: Tranquility, stillness, emptiness, and non-action—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the essence of the Way and virtue. Thus it is said: When the Sage rests in ease, he is level and yielding. Being level and yielding, he is tranquil. Tranquil and level, cares and troubles cannot enter, perverse qi cannot assail. Thus his virtue is whole and his spirit unharmed.\n\nThus it is said: The Sage’s life is the movement of Heaven; his death is the transformation of things. At rest, he shares the virtue of yin; in motion, he moves with the waves of yang. He does not precede fortune nor initiate misfortune. He responds only after being stirred, moves only when pressed, rises only when compelled. He discards knowledge and precedent, following the principle of Heaven. No heavenly disasters, no burdens from things, no human reproach, no blame from spirits. His life is like floating; his death is like repose. He does not ponder nor scheme. Radiant yet not dazzling, trustworthy yet not bound by expectation. In sleep, he does not dream; awake, he has no worries. His spirit is pure and unadulterated; his soul does not weary. Emptiness and tranquility—only thus does he accord with the virtue of Heaven.\n\nThus it is said: Sorrow and joy are perversions of virtue; delight and anger are excesses of the Way; likes and dislikes are lapses of virtue. Therefore, a heart without sorrow or joy is the perfection of virtue; unity without care is the perfection of stillness; nothing to oppose is the perfection of emptiness; nothing to resist is the perfection of purity.\n\nThus it is said: When the body labors without rest, it breaks down; when essence is used without cease, it wearies; weariness leads to exhaustion. The nature of water is such that when unadulterated, it is clear; when undisturbed, it is level. If pent up and unmoving, it cannot remain clear—this is the image of Heavenly virtue.\n\nThus it is said: Pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, serene and non-active, moving in accord with Heaven’s course—this is the Way of nurturing the spirit. As for the sword of Gan and Yue, though cased and treasured, it is never used—this is the height of preciousness. When the spirit flows unimpeded in all four directions, reaching everywhere, above touching Heaven, below coiling upon Earth, transforming and nurturing the myriad things, beyond all image—its name is *Uniting with the Emperor*. The Way of purity and simplicity guards only the spirit. Guarding without loss, it unites with the spirit. The essence of unity penetrates, harmonizing with Heavenly order.\n\nA rustic saying goes: The common man values profit; the incorruptible man values fame; the worthy man esteems will; the Sage treasures essence. Thus, *simplicity* means having nothing mixed with it; *purity* means not harming the spirit. One who embodies purity and simplicity is called a *True Person*.\n\n*Restoring Nature*\nThose who *restore nature* through vulgar learning seek to return to their original state. (Some versions mistakenly add an extra \"vulgar\" due to scribal repetition.) Those who muddle their desires with vulgar thoughts to attain clarity are called the benighted. The ancients who cultivated the Way nurtured knowledge with tranquility. To live without employing knowledge is called nurturing tranquility with knowledge. Knowledge and tranquility nurture each other, and harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature.\n\nVirtue is harmony; the Way is principle. Virtue that embraces all is benevolence; the Way that orders all is righteousness. Righteousness made manifest and things drawn close is loyalty. Centered, pure, and returning to genuine feeling is joy. Trust in conduct, accommodating form, and following pattern is propriety. When propriety and joy spread everywhere, the world falls into chaos. When the upright are obscured and virtue is veiled, virtue does not overreach. Overreaching causes things to lose their nature.\n\nIn ancient times, people dwelt in primordial chaos, attaining tranquility with their age. In that era, yin and yang were harmonious and still, ghosts and spirits did not disturb, the four seasons kept their rhythm, the myriad things were unharmed, and the multitudes did not die young. Though people possessed knowledge, they had no use for it—this was called *Supreme Unity*. In that time, none acted, yet all was constantly spontaneous.\n\nWhen virtue declined, Suiren and Fuxi began to rule the world, and thus compliance was no longer unity. When virtue declined further, Shennong and the Yellow Emperor began to rule the world, and thus peace was no longer compliance. When virtue declined yet further, Yao and Shun began to rule the world, initiating the currents of governance and transformation. Integrity dissolved and simplicity scattered; they departed from the Way to pursue goodness, risked virtue to act. Then they abandoned nature and followed the heart. Heart matched heart in recognition, yet knowledge was insufficient to settle the world. Thus they adorned it with culture and augmented it with erudition.",

How could the person of the Way arise in the world? How could the world arise in the Way? If the Way cannot arise in the world, and the world cannot arise in the Way, even if the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, his virtue is concealed. Yet concealment is not self-concealment.\n\nWhat the ancients called \"recluses\" did not crouch in hiding to avoid being seen, did not seal their words to prevent their utterance, did not bury their knowledge to withhold its expression—it was the great error of the times that compelled them. Had their time and destiny aligned with the flourishing of the world, they would have returned to unity without trace. Had their time and destiny been utterly at odds with the world, they would have deeply rooted themselves in tranquility and awaited their end.

Serene in their place, they returned to their nature—what more was there to do? The Way is not fulfilled in petty conduct, virtue is not fulfilled in petty understanding. Petty understanding harms virtue, petty conduct harms the Way. Thus it is said: rectify the self and that is all.\n\nTo delight in wholeness is called \"attaining one’s aspiration.\" What the ancients called \"attaining one’s aspiration\" did not refer to carriages and caps of office.

Seeing gain, they lightly cast away their lives—how can this not be delusion?\n\nThe people of Yue murdered their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, troubled by this, fled into the cinnabar caves, and Yue was left without a king. When they could not find Prince Sou, they pursued him into the cinnabar caves. Prince Sou refused to emerge, so the people of Yue smoked him out with mugwort and bore him forth in the royal carriage. Prince Sou grasped the reins and mounted the chariot, then looked to heaven and cried: \"Rulership! Rulership!

He came to see Yuan Xian.\n\nYuan Xian, wearing a hat of rushes and hempen sandals, leaning on a staff of autumn millet, answered the door. Zi Gong said: \"Alas! Master, what ails you?\"\n\nYuan Xian replied: \"I have heard that to lack wealth is called poverty, but to study and be unable to practice is called affliction. Now I am poor, not afflicted.\"\n\nZi Gong stepped back, his face flushed with shame.\n\nYuan Xian laughed and said: \"To act for the sake of worldly approval, to befriend for the sake of cliques, to study for others, to teach for oneself, to cloak oneself in benevolence and righteousness, to adorn oneself with carriages and horses—these are things I cannot bear to do.\"\n\nZengzi dwelt in Wei. His padded robe had no outer garment, his complexion was sallow and emaciated, his hands and feet calloused. For three days he did not kindle a fire, for ten years he did not make new clothes. When he straightened his cap, its strings broke; when he grasped his lapel, his elbows showed; when he put on his shoes, their heels split. Yet he dragged his hempen robe and sang the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filling heaven and earth, as if issuing from metal and stone. The Son of Heaven could not make him a subject, the feudal lords could not make him a friend. Thus, he who cultivates the will forgets the body; he who cultivates the body forgets profit; he who attains the Way forgets the mind.\n\nConfucius said to Yan Hui: \"Hui, come. Your family is poor and your station low—why do you not enter office?\"\n\nYan Hui replied: \"I do not wish to enter office. Outside the outer wall I have fifty *mu* of fields, enough to provide gruel and porridge. Within the outer wall I have ten *mu* of fields, enough to provide silk and hemp. Playing the zither is enough to amuse myself. What I have learned of the Master’s Way is enough to bring me joy.\"",

Yet now you bear the look of hunger, and when the lord sent you food, you refused it. Is this not fate?\"\n\nMaster Lie Zi laughed and said to her: \"The lord does not know me personally; he sent me grain on the word of another. When he seeks to punish me, he will likewise do so on the word of another. This is why I did not accept.\"",

He ruled for fourteen years, but a great drought came, and houses burned. Divination was performed at Taiyang.

      "translated_text": "**The Twenty-Ninth Scroll of the Nan Hua Zhen Jing, Following the Original Text**\n\n*Collated by Peng Xiang, Disciple of Lu Ling Zhu Feng Luo Mian Dao*\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: Robber Zhi**\n\nThe following account resembles those found in the *Strategies of Lu* and the *Records of the Grand Historian*, likely composed by Chu Shaosun.\n\nConfucius was a friend of Liuxia Ji. Liuxia Ji’s younger brother was named Robber Zhi.\n\nRobber Zhi commanded nine thousand followers, rampaging across the world and terrorizing the feudal lords. He broke into homes, drove off people’s cattle and horses, seized their wives and daughters, coveted gain while forgetting kinship, showing no regard for parents or brothers, nor offering sacrifices to his ancestors. Wherever he passed, great states fortified their cities, small states took refuge in their strongholds, and the common people suffered greatly.\n\nConfucius said to Liuxia Ji: \"As a father, one must instruct his son; as an elder brother, one must teach his younger brother. If a father cannot instruct his son, or an elder brother cannot teach his younger brother, then the bond of father and son, elder and younger brother, is worthless. Now, sir, you are a man of talent in this age, yet your brother is Robber Zhi, a scourge upon the world, and you cannot teach him. I am secretly ashamed for you. Allow me to go and reason with him.\"\n\nLiuxia Ji replied: \"You say that a father must instruct his son, and an elder brother must teach his younger brother. But if a son does not heed his father’s instruction, or a younger brother does not accept his elder brother’s teaching, what can even your eloquence accomplish? Moreover, Zhi’s nature is such that his mind surges like a spring, his will gusts like the wind. He is strong enough to resist enemies, eloquent enough to gloss over wrongs. He delights when his heart is obeyed, rages when it is opposed, and is easily provoked by words. You must not go!\"\n\nConfucius did not listen. Yan Hui drove the carriage, and Zigong stood to the right as they went to see Robber Zhi.\n\nRobber Zhi was then resting his troops on the southern slope of Mount Tai, devouring the liver of a man. Confucius descended from the carriage and approached, addressing the herald: \"I, Kong Qiu of Lu, have heard of the general’s lofty virtue and humbly bow twice to the herald.\"\n\nThe herald went in to announce him. Robber Zhi, upon hearing this, flew into a rage. His eyes blazed like stars, his hair bristled to his cap, and he said: \"Is this not that crafty, deceitful man Kong Qiu of Lu? Tell him this: You fabricate words and invent phrases, falsely invoking Wen and Wu. You wear a cap of dead branches and gird yourself with the ribs of a dead ox. You spout endless, twisted arguments, eating without plowing, clothing yourself without weaving. You flap your lips and wag your tongue, stirring up right and wrong to delude the rulers of the world. You lead the scholars of the world astray, making them abandon their roots to falsely practice filial piety and brotherly love, all in hopes of seizing fiefs and riches. Your crimes are grave and heavy indeed! Flee at once! Or I shall add your liver to my midday meal.\"\n\nConfucius sent word again: \"I am fortunate to be acquainted with Ji and wish to gaze upon the hem of your robe.\"\n\nThe herald relayed this. Robber Zhi said: \"Let him come forward.\"\n\nConfucius hurried forward, stepped back from his mat, and bowed twice to Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi was enraged. He stretched out his legs, gripped his sword, glared fiercely, and roared like a nursing tiger: \"Come forward, Qiu! If your words please me, you shall live; if they oppose me, you shall die.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"I have heard that there are three virtues under Heaven: To be born and grow tall, surpassingly handsome, so that young and old, noble and base, all delight in seeing you—this is the highest virtue. To comprehend the workings of Heaven and Earth and distinguish all things—this is the middle virtue. To be brave, fierce, and resolute, gathering troops and leading armies—this is the lowest virtue. Whoever possesses even one of these virtues is fit to face south and declare himself sovereign. Now, general, you possess all three: your body stands eight feet and two inches tall, your face and eyes radiant, your lips like gleaming cinnabar, your teeth like aligned shells, your voice attuned to the Yellow Bell. Yet you are called Robber Zhi—I am secretly ashamed for you that you do not claim what is rightfully yours. If you are willing to heed me, I shall go south to Wu and Yue, north to Qi and Lu, east to Song and Wei, west to Jin and Chu, and have a great city of several hundred *li* built for you, establishing a domain of hundreds of thousands of households. I shall exalt you as a feudal lord, renewing the world with you, disbanding your troops, gathering and nurturing your brothers, and together offering sacrifices to your ancestors. This is the conduct of a sage and a man of talent, the wish of all under Heaven.\"\n\nRobber Zhi flew into a rage and said: \"Come forward, Qiu! Those who can be swayed by profit or admonished by words are but the foolish and vulgar masses. Now, to be tall and handsome, so that all who see you are pleased—this is the legacy of my parents. Even if you do not praise me, do I not know this myself? Moreover, I have heard that those who flatter others to their faces also slander them behind their backs. Now you speak to me of great cities and multitudes of people—you seek to lure me with profit and treat me like a tame beast. How can this last? The greatest of cities is still smaller than the world. Yao and Shun ruled all under Heaven, yet their descendants had not even a place to drive a nail. Tang and Wu became Sons of Heaven, yet their lines were later extinguished. Was this not because their gains were too great?\n\nFurthermore, I have heard that in ancient times, beasts were many and people few, so the people dwelled in nests to avoid them. By day they gathered acorns and chestnuts, by night they roosted in trees—thus they were called the people of the Nest Builder. In ancient times, people did not know clothing.

      "translated_text": "This was the height of utmost virtue. Yet even the Yellow Emperor could not fully realize virtue, battling Chiyou on the fields of Zhuolu, where blood flowed for a hundred li. Yao and Shun arose and established their ministers. Tang exiled his lord, and King Wu killed Zhou. From then on, the strong oppressed the weak, and the many tyrannized the few. Since the time of Tang and Wu, all have been followers of disorder.\n\nNow you, sir, cultivate the Way of Wen and Wu, grasp the world’s debates, and teach later generations. Wearing fine robes and sashes, you speak with artful words and feign virtuous conduct to delude the lords of the world, all to seek wealth and honor. No thief is greater than you—why does the world not call you *Thief Qiu* instead of calling me *Robber Zhi*?\n\nYou used honeyed words to persuade Zilu to follow you. You made Zilu remove his warrior’s cap, lay aside his long sword, and receive your teachings. The world all says: *Confucius can halt violence and forbid wrongdoing.* Yet in the end, Zilu sought to kill the lord of Wei but failed, and his body was minced upon the eastern gate of Wei. This was because your teaching was insufficient.\n\nDo you still claim to be a man of talent and a sage? You were twice driven from Lu, your traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Qi, besieged in Chen and Cai, and found no refuge under heaven. You taught Zilu to meet such a fate—unable to secure his own safety above or benefit others below—how can your Way be worthy of esteem?\n\nOf those the world exalts, none surpasses the Yellow Emperor. Yet even he could not preserve perfect virtue, fighting on the fields of Zhuolu where blood flowed for a hundred li. Yao was not kind, Shun was not filial, Yu was crippled, Tang exiled his lord, King Wu attacked Zhou, and King Wen was imprisoned at Youli. These six men are those the world reveres. Yet if we examine them closely, all were deluded by profit, forcing themselves against their true nature. Their conduct is truly shameful.\n\nThe world calls worthy men like Boyi and Shuqi. Boyi and Shuqi renounced the rulership of Gubuzhu, starved to death on Mount Shouyang, and their flesh went unburied. Bao Jiao adorned his conduct to condemn the age and died embracing a tree. Shentu Di remonstrated but was not heeded, so he carried a stone and drowned himself in the river, becoming food for fish and turtles. Jie Zitui was utterly loyal, cutting flesh from his thigh to feed Duke Wen. Later, the duke betrayed him, so Zitui left in anger and burned to death holding a tree. Weisheng arranged to meet a woman beneath a bridge; when she did not come and the waters rose, he refused to leave and drowned holding the bridge pillar. These six men differ not from dismembered dogs, drowned pigs, or beggars clutching gourds—all abandoned their names, scorned death, and failed to cherish their fundamental nature or nurture their lives.\n\nThe world calls loyal ministers like Prince Bigan and Wu Zixu. Zixu was sunk in the river, and Bigan had his heart cut out. These two are called loyal ministers, yet in the end, the world laughs at them. From a higher perspective, even Zixu and Bigan are not worthy of esteem.\n\nAs for what you, Qiu, tell me: if you speak of ghostly matters, I cannot know them.

      "translated_text": "Now I tell you of human nature: the eye desires to see beauty, the ear desires to hear sound, the mouth desires to savor flavor, and the will and qi desire fulfillment. Of men, the longest-lived reach a hundred years, the average eighty, the shortest sixty—yet when we subtract days lost to illness, frailty, mourning, death, and sorrow, the moments when one opens one’s mouth to laugh amount to no more than four or five days in a month.\n\nHeaven and earth are without end, but man’s death comes at its appointed time. Clutching the instrument of this appointed time, one entrusts oneself to the boundless expanse—suddenly, it is no different from a fine steed galloping past a crack in the wall. Those who cannot delight their will and nurture their lives are all men who have not mastered the Way.\n\nAll that you, Qiu, have said is what I reject. Go quickly, return home, and speak no more of it. Your Way is but a frenzied, babbling, deceitful, and hollow sham—it cannot preserve the true. What is there to discuss?\n\nConfucius bowed twice, hurried out, mounted his carriage, and grasped the reins—three times they slipped from his hands. His eyes were dazed and sightless, his complexion ashen like the dead. He leaned against the crossbar, head bowed, unable to catch his breath. Returning to the eastern gate of Lu, he chanced upon Liuxia Ji.\n\nLiuxia Ji said, “You have been absent these past days, and your carriage bears the marks of travel. Might you have gone to see Zhi?”\n\nConfucius looked up to the heavens and sighed, “Yes.”\n\nLiuxia Ji asked, “Did Zhi perhaps offend you as I warned?”\n\nConfucius replied, “Yes. I am one who, having no illness, yet cauterizes himself. I rushed to stroke the tiger’s head and braid its whiskers—nearly did I not escape the tiger’s jaws!”\n\nZizhang asked Mang Goude, “Why not act with virtue? Without virtuous action, one is not trusted; without trust, one is not employed; without employment, one gains no benefit. Thus, when one considers reputation and calculates profit, righteousness and truth are what matter. If one abandons reputation and profit and turns inward to the heart, then can a scholar go even a single day without virtuous action?”\n\nMang Goude replied, “The shameless grow rich, and the deceitful rise to prominence. The greatest of reputation and profit lie in shamelessness and deceit. Thus, when one considers reputation and calculates profit, trust and truth are what matter. If one abandons reputation and profit and turns inward to the heart, then does not the scholar’s action embrace the Heavenly?”\n\nZizhang said, “In ancient times, Jie and Zhou were honored as Sons of Heaven and possessed all under heaven. Yet if one were to tell Zang Ju, ‘Your conduct is like Jie and Zhou,’ his face would flush with shame, and he would bristle with resentment—such is the low regard of petty men. Confucius and Mo Di lived in poverty as commoners. Yet if one were to tell a prime minister, ‘Your conduct is like Confucius and Mo Di,’ his expression would change, and he would claim insufficiency—such is the true esteem of the scholar. Thus, to be a Son of Heaven does not necessarily confer honor, nor does poverty as a commoner necessarily confer disgrace. The distinction between honor and disgrace lies in the beauty or baseness of one’s conduct.”\n\nMang Goude said, “Petty thieves are imprisoned, but great thieves become lords. At the gates of lords, righteous scholars abide. In former times, Duke Huan of Qi killed his elder brother and took his sister-in-law, yet Guan Zhong served as his minister.

      "translated_text": "The judgment deems them base, the conduct degrades them—thus the true nature of word and deed wars within the breast. Is this not perverse?\n\nThus the *Book* says: “Who is vile? Who is noble? The accomplished stand at the head, the unaccomplished at the tail.”\n\nZizhang said: “If you do not act, kinship and estrangement will lack order, noble and base will lack righteousness, elder and younger will lack sequence. How then shall the Five Norms and Six Positions be distinguished?”\n\nMang Goude said: “Yao executed his eldest son, Shun exiled his younger brother—where is the order in kinship? Tang banished Jie, King Wu slew Zhou—where is the righteousness in noble and base? King Ji was the rightful heir, yet the Duke of Zhou killed his elder brother—where is the sequence in elder and younger? The Confucians preach hypocritical words, the Mohists advocate universal love—how then shall the Five Norms and Six Positions be distinguished?\n\nMoreover, you rectify for the sake of fame, I rectify for the sake of profit. In truth, fame and profit neither accord with principle nor reflect the Dao. Daily I dispute with you before Wu Yue, saying: ‘The petty man dies for wealth, the noble man dies for fame—their motives for altering their nature differ, yet in abandoning what they do to pursue what they do not, they are one and the same.’\n\nThus it is said: Do not be a petty man, lest you die in rebellion against Heaven. Do not be a noble man, but follow Heaven’s principle. Whether crooked or straight, align with the celestial pole. Observe the four directions, ebb and flow with the times. Whether right or wrong, grasp the revolving mechanism. Stand alone in intent, wander with the Dao. Act without contrivance, establish no fixed righteousness, lest you lose what you seek. Pursue no wealth, achieve no fame, lest you abandon Heaven.\n\nBigan was disemboweled, Zixu had his eyes gouged out—such are the calamities of loyalty. Zhigong testified against his father, Weisheng drowned holding to his word—such are the perils of trust. Baozi stood until he withered, Shenzi refused to defend himself—such are the harms of integrity. Confucius did not see his mother, Kuangzi did not see his father—such are the failures of righteousness.\n\nFrom the traditions of antiquity to the discourses of later ages, those esteemed as scholars rectify their words and align their deeds, yet still suffer misfortune and encounter disaster.”\n\nWu Zu asked Zhi He: “No man in the end fails to pursue fame and seek profit. The wealthy draw men to them; those drawn defer to them; those who defer honor them. To be honored and deferred is the Way to long life, bodily ease, and joy of heart. Yet you alone show no such intent—is your wisdom insufficient? Or do you know but lack the strength to act? Or do you deliberately reject the true path?”\n\nZhi He said: “These men, born in the same age and dwelling in the same village, regard those who transcend custom and surpass the world as lacking any guiding principle. Thus they survey the ages, discerning right and wrong. They conform to the俗 and transform with the世, abandoning what is most weighty, discarding what is most honorable, all for the sake of their pursuits. How can their discourse on the Way to long life, bodily ease, and joy of heart not be far from the mark?\n\nThe agony of sorrow, the peace of contentment—these are not reflected in the body. The terror of alarm, the joy of delight—these are not mirrored in the heart. They know what they do but not why they do it. Thus, though they be honored as Son of Heaven and possess all under Heaven, they cannot escape misfortune.”\n\nWu Zu said: “Wealth, to man, is without disadvantage. It exhausts beauty and exhausts power, reaching what the perfected cannot attain, what the worthy cannot equal. It wields the courage and strength of the heroic as its might, commands the wisdom and schemes of others as its insight, and appropriates the virtue of others as its own excellence. Though not enthroned, it is revered as a lord and father.\n\nMoreover, the allure of sound and color, flavor and power—these delight the heart without need of learning, comfort the body without need of imitation. Desires and aversions, approach and avoidance—these require no teacher, for they are man’s nature. Though all under Heaven condemn me, who can renounce them?”\n\nZhi He said: “The actions of the wise move in accord with the people, not transgressing their measure. Thus, content, they do not contend; lacking nothing, they do not seek. Those who lack seek, contending in all directions yet not deeming themselves greedy. Those who have surplus yield, relinquishing all under Heaven yet not deeming themselves incorrupt. The truth of incorruptibility and greed lies not in external compulsion but in reflecting on one’s own measure.\n\nThough enthroned as Son of Heaven, they do not use their nobility to domineer. Though possessing all under Heaven, they do not use their wealth to toy with others. Calculating the harm, considering the consequences, they deem it injurious to their nature, and thus decline and do not accept—not to seek fame and reputation.\n\nYao and Shun ruled as emperors and were revered, not to benevolently govern all under Heaven, but to avoid harming life with beauty. Shanjuan and Xu You declined the throne, not out of empty humility, but to avoid harming themselves with affairs. All sought what benefited them and declined what harmed them. Though all under Heaven calls them worthy, they did not act to cultivate fame and reputation.”\n\nWu Zu said: “If one must cling to fame, endure bodily hardship, forgo sweetness, and restrain nourishment to preserve life, one is no better than a chronic invalid, long afflicted yet not dead.”\n\nZhi He said: “Equilibrium is fortune, excess is harm—of all things, none is not so, and wealth is the most extreme. Now, the rich man’s ears are filled with the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes; his mouth savors the taste of fine meats and rich wines, stirring his mind and causing him to neglect his affairs—can this be called disorder? Engulfed in arrogance, he labors like one bearing a heavy burden uphill—can this be called suffering? Coveting wealth, he seeks consolation; craving power, he exhausts himself. At rest, he is drowned in indolence; in comfort, he is swollen with pride—can this be called sickness? Driven by the desire for wealth and the pursuit of profit, he is deafened as though his ears were walled up, yet does not avoid it; he is haughty yet does not desist—can this be called disgrace? Wealth accumulates yet goes unused; he clings to it without release, his heart filled with sorrow and bitterness, ever seeking more without cease—can this be called sorrow?”",

His inner chambers are fortified with towers and bars, and he dares not walk alone outside—can this be called fear? These six afflictions are the greatest harms under heaven, yet all are overlooked and left unexamined. When disaster strikes, he exhausts his nature and depletes his wealth in vain, unable even to restore a single day of peace. Thus, when viewed by name, they are unseen; when sought for profit, they are unattainable. Yet men strain their minds and break their bodies in contention for these—is this not delusion?\n\n*The Southern Florescence True Classic, Following the Root, Scroll Twenty-Nine Concludes*\n*The Southern Florescence True Classic, Following the Root, Scroll Thirty*\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: Discourse on Swords**\n\nLong ago, King Wen of Zhao delighted in swords. Over three thousand swordsmen thronged his gates as guests, clashing before him day and night. Each year, more than a hundred perished or were wounded, yet his passion knew no end. After three years of this, the state declined, and the feudal lords plotted against him.\n\nThe crown prince, Kui, grew anxious and offered a reward to his attendants: “Whoever can persuade the king to abandon his fondness for swordsmen shall receive a thousand gold pieces.” His attendants replied, “Zhuangzi is the one for this.”\n\nThe prince sent envoys bearing a thousand gold pieces to present to Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi declined the gift and accompanied the messengers to see the prince. “What instruction does the prince have for me,” he asked, “that he offers me a thousand gold pieces?” The prince replied, “I have heard that you are enlightened and sagely. I humbly present this gold to honor your attendants. If you refuse it, how dare I speak further?”\n\nZhuangzi said, “I have heard that the prince wishes to employ me to end the king’s obsession. If I persuade the king but displease him, or fail to satisfy the prince, I shall be executed—what use would gold be to me then? But if I please the king and satisfy the prince, what in Zhao could I not obtain?”\n\nThe prince said, “Indeed. My father sees only swordsmen.”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “Very well. I am skilled in the sword.”\n\nThe prince said, “But the swordsmen my father favors all have unkempt hair, bristling sideburns, drooping caps, tassels of coarse silk, short jackets, glaring eyes, and speak with difficulty. The king delights in them. If you appear before him in scholar’s robes, the outcome will be most unfavorable.”\n\nZhuangzi said, “Allow me to prepare a swordsman’s attire.” After three days, he had his sword attire ready and was presented to the prince, who then accompanied him to see the king.\n\nThe king drew his naked blade and waited. Zhuangzi entered the palace hall without haste, and when he saw the king, he did not bow. The king asked, “What instruction do you bring, that the prince has gone before me?”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “I have heard that Your Majesty delights in swords, so I have come to present myself with my sword.”\n\nThe king asked, “What can your sword do to restrain others?”\n\nZhuangzi answered, “My sword cuts down one man every ten paces, and its course is unobstructed for a thousand *li*.”\n\nThe king was greatly pleased and said, “You would be invincible under heaven!”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “The way of the sword is to present emptiness, offer advantage, strike after the opponent moves, and arrive first. I would like to demonstrate.”\n\nThe king said, “Rest now, return to your lodging, and await my command. I shall arrange a contest and summon you.”\n\nThe king then tested his swordsmen for seven days, during which over sixty were killed or wounded. He selected five or six and had them stand with their swords in the palace courtyard before summoning Zhuangzi.\n\nThe king said, “Today, let us see you contend with these men.”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “I have long awaited this.”\n\nThe king asked, “What length of sword do you wield?”\n\nZhuangzi said, “Any length will do, but I possess three swords, and I shall use whichever Your Majesty prefers. Allow me to describe them first, then demonstrate.”\n\nThe king said, “I wish to hear of the three swords.”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “There is the sword of the Son of Heaven, the sword of the feudal lords, and the sword of the commoner.”\n\nThe king asked, “What is the sword of the Son of Heaven like?”\n\nZhuangzi said, “The sword of the Son of Heaven has its edge in Yanxi and Shicheng, its guard in Mount Tai of Qi, its spine in Jin and Wei, its hilt in Zhou and Song, and its sides in Han and Wei. It is wrapped in the four barbarian tribes, bound by the four seasons, encircled by the Bohai Sea, and girded by Mount Heng. It is governed by the five phases, judged by punishment and virtue, opened by yin and yang, sustained by spring and summer, and wielded in autumn and winter. When this sword is thrust forward, nothing precedes it; when raised, nothing is above it; when pressed down, nothing is beneath it; when swung, nothing stands beside it. Above, it severs floating clouds; below, it cuts through the earth’s foundations. When this sword is employed, the feudal lords are brought to order, and all under heaven submit. This is the sword of the Son of Heaven.”\n\nKing Wen, bewildered and lost in thought, asked, “What is the sword of the feudal lords like?”\n\nZhuangzi replied, “The sword of the feudal lords has its edge in the wisdom and courage of knights, its guard in the purity and integrity of scholars, its spine in the worthiness and goodness of gentlemen, its hilt in the loyalty and sagacity of sages, and its sides in the boldness and heroism of warriors. When this sword is thrust forward, nothing precedes it; when raised, nothing is above it; when pressed down, nothing is beneath it; when swung, nothing stands beside it. Above, it follows the roundness of heaven, aligning with the three luminaries; below, it follows the squareness of earth, aligning with the four seasons.”",

      "translated_text": "Far indeed has he strayed from the Dao.\n\nZigong returned and reported to Confucius. Confucius pushed aside his zither and rose, saying, “He must be a sage!” Then he descended to seek him out. By the marsh’s edge, the stranger was just then staff in hand, drawing his boat toward shore. Glancing back, he saw Confucius, turned around, and stood facing him. Confucius retreated, bowed twice, and advanced.\n\nThe stranger asked, “What do you seek?”\n\nConfucius replied, “A short while ago, sir left with words unfinished. I, unworthy as I am, did not grasp their meaning. I have waited humbly in your wake, hoping to hear even the sound of your cough or spittle, that I might complete my understanding.”\n\nThe stranger exclaimed, “Ah! How earnest is your love of learning!”\n\nConfucius bowed twice and rose, saying, “From my youth I have cultivated learning, and now at sixty-nine, I have yet to hear the highest teaching. How dare I not remain open in heart?”\n\nThe stranger said, “Like attracts like, and like sounds resonate—this is the principle of Heaven. Let me set forth what I possess and expound upon what you pursue. What you pursue pertains to human affairs. When the Son of Heaven, the feudal lords, the great officers, and the common people—these four—each rectifies himself, governance is at its finest. When these four abandon their proper stations, no disorder could be greater. When officials attend to their duties and each person concerns himself with his own affairs, none oversteps his bounds. Thus, fields lie fallow and homes stand exposed, clothing and food are insufficient, taxes and levies go uncollected, wives and concubines are at odds, and elders and juniors lack proper order—these are the worries of the common people. Inability to fulfill one’s role, official duties left undone, conduct that is not pure and clear, subordinates who are negligent and idle, achievements unrecognized, ranks and emoluments unsecured—these are the worries of the great officers. The court lacks loyal ministers, the state is benighted and disordered, artisans lack skill, tribute is unworthy, seasonal offerings lag behind others, and one does not follow the Son of Heaven—these are the worries of the feudal lords. Yin and yang are out of harmony, cold and heat arrive untimely, harming the myriad things; feudal lords act with violence and disorder, seizing and attacking one another, ravaging the people; ritual and music lack moderation, resources are exhausted, human relationships are unadorned, and the hundred clans are licentious and chaotic—these are the worries of the Son of Heaven’s ministers.\n\nNow, you possess neither the authority of the Son of Heaven, the feudal lords, or their ministers above, nor the office of a great officer with its duties below, yet you presume to refine ritual and music, select human relationships, and transform the common people. Is this not overreaching in affairs?\n\nMoreover, people have eight flaws, and affairs have four perils—these cannot be left unexamined. To engage in affairs not one’s own is called *meddling*; to advance where none pays heed is called *flattery*; to speak in accord with another’s wishes is called *sycophancy*; to speak without discerning right or wrong is called *obsequiousness*; to delight in speaking of others’ faults is called *slander*; to sever friendships and estrange kin is called *treachery*; to praise falsely and deceive in order to ruin others is called *depravity*; to fail to distinguish good from bad, to accommodate both sides, and to stealthily seize what one desires is called *perfidy*. These eight flaws bring chaos to others externally and harm to oneself internally. The noble person does not befriend such, nor does the enlightened ruler employ them.\n\nAs for the four perils: to delight in managing great affairs, altering and changing constants in pursuit of merit and fame is called *presumptuousness*; to monopolize knowledge, arrogate affairs, encroach upon others, and act on one’s own is called *greed*; to see one’s faults yet not change, and to hear admonition yet grow worse is called *obduracy*; to approve only what accords with oneself and disapprove even what is good if it differs from oneself is called *arrogance*. These are the four perils. Only when one has cast off the eight flaws and refrains from the four perils can one be taught.\n\nConfucius sighed deeply, bowed twice, and rose, saying, “I was twice driven from Lu, had my traces erased in Wei, was made to fell a tree in Song, and was besieged between Chen and Cai. I do not know what errors I committed to incur these four slanders—why is this?”\n\nThe stranger’s expression turned somber as he said, “How difficult it is for you to awaken! There was a man who feared his shadow and loathed his footprints, and so ran to escape them. The more he lifted his feet, the more footprints he made; the faster he ran, the more his shadow clung to him. Believing he was still too slow, he ran without cease until he collapsed and died. He did not know that by standing in the shade he could rest his shadow, and by remaining still he could still his footprints—how foolish he was!\n\nYou scrutinize the space between benevolence and righteousness, examine the boundaries of sameness and difference, observe the changes of activity and stillness, adjust the measure of giving and receiving, order the passions of like and dislike, and harmonize the moderation of joy and anger—yet you nearly fail to escape harm. If you carefully cultivate your own person, guard your true nature, and return things to others, you will have no encumbrances. Now, instead of cultivating your own person, you seek from others—is this not misplaced?”\n\nConfucius sighed deeply and asked, “May I ask what is meant by *true*?”\n\nThe stranger said, “*True* is the utmost of essence and sincerity. Without essence and sincerity, one cannot move others. Thus, one who forces tears may seem sorrowful but is not mournful; one who forces anger may seem stern but is not awe-inspiring; one who forces affection may smile but is not harmonious. True sorrow is silent yet mournful; true anger is unexpressed yet awe-inspiring; true affection is unsmiling yet harmonious. When truth resides within, the spirit moves without. This is why truth is prized.\n\nApplied to human principles: in serving parents, it is filial piety; in serving rulers, it is loyalty; in drinking wine, it is joy; in mourning, it is sorrow. In all things, integrity must be primary: in achievement, merit is primary; in drinking wine, joy is primary; in mourning, sorrow is primary; in serving parents, suitability is primary. When merit is achieved, no trace of it remains; in serving parents with suitability, no account of the means is kept; in drinking wine with joy, no selection of vessels is made; in mourning with sorrow, no inquiry into ritual is had.\n\nRitual is what the common customs devise; truth is what one receives from Heaven, naturally and unalterably. Thus, the sage models himself on Heaven and values truth, not being bound by custom. The foolish do the opposite: they cannot model themselves on Heaven and are anxious about others; they do not know the value of truth and, in their mediocrity, are swayed by custom. Thus, they are never sufficient. How lamentable! You were early immersed in human artifice and only now hear of the great Dao.”",

      "translated_text": "Confucius bowed twice and rose, saying: “Today, I, Qiu, have had the good fortune of an encounter—truly as if favored by Heaven. You, Master, have not disdained to treat me as a servant and instruct me in person. Dare I ask where you dwell? I would follow and receive your teaching, that I might complete my study of the great Dao.”\n\nThe stranger replied: “I have heard this: those who can be led may be guided to the subtle Dao; those who cannot be led do not comprehend the Way. Take care not to guide them, lest you bring harm upon yourself. Strive on, for I leave you now.” With that, he poled his boat away, gliding along the reeds.\n\nYan Yuan turned the carriage, and Zilu handed the reins, but Confucius did not look back. Only when the water’s ripples stilled and the sound of the oar vanished did he dare to board. Zilu stepped beside the carriage and asked: “I, You, have long served you, yet never have I seen you meet another with such reverence. Kings of ten thousand chariots, lords of a thousand, when they meet you, do not fail to observe proper courtesy, yet you still bear a bearing of dignified reserve. Now this old fisherman, leaning on his staff and standing defiantly, and you bowed deeply, bending like a chime stone, responding with words and bows—was this not excessive? The disciples all find it strange. What has this fisherman done to deserve such treatment?”\n\nConfucius leaned on the crossbar and sighed, saying: “Truly, You, you are difficult to transform. Though you have been steeped in ritual and righteousness for some time, your coarse and rustic heart remains unchanged to this day. Come closer, and I will tell you: to meet an elder without reverence is to lack ritual; to meet a worthy without respect is to lack benevolence. If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself before others. If one does not humble oneself with utmost sincerity, one cannot attain the truth, and thus one’s person suffers lasting harm. Alas! There is no greater misfortune for a person than the lack of benevolence—and you alone cling to it!\n\nMoreover, the Dao is that by which all things proceed. All beings that lose it die; those that attain it live. In affairs, to go against it is to fail; to follow it is to succeed. Thus, wherever the Dao resides, the sage honors it. Now this old fisherman possesses the Dao—how could I dare not revere him?”\n\n*The Southern Florescence Scripture, following the original text, concludes its thirtieth scroll.*",
      "overlap_context": "ual is what the common customs devise; truth is what one receives from Heaven, naturally and unalterably. Thus, the sage models himself on Heaven and values truth, not being bound by custom. The foolish do the opposite: they cannot model themselves on Heaven and are anxious about others; they do not know the value of truth and, in their mediocrity, are swayed by custom. Thus, they are never sufficient. How lamentable! You were early immersed in human artifice and only now hear of the great Dao.”",
