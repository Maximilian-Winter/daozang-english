  "full_translation": "**The Original Purport of the Mysterious Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue**\n\n**Title:** *The Original Purport of the Mysterious Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* (also known as *The Original Purport of the Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, *The Original Purport of Laozi*, or *The Original Purport of the Mysterious Classic*). Composed by Du Daojian of the Yuan dynasty. Four juan. Prefaces by Li Liwu, Zhang Yucai, Mou Yan, Xu Tianyu, and others.\n\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* section, *Jade Instructions* category.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to *The Original Purport of the Mysterious Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***\n\nThe *Laozi* and the *Yijing* share the same Dao. The *Yijing* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate, yet the sacred scripture leaves it unelaborated. Its opening with *Qian* and *Kun* pertains to the Dao of the Posterior Heaven—modeled after heaven and earth, thus aligning the Confucian and Daoist paths with the workings of heaven and earth. The Supreme Change (*Taiyi*), unseen even in qi, is regarded by Daoists as the ancestor of the Great Dao, the nameless origin of heaven and earth, the Dao of the Prior Heaven. The Dao follows spontaneity, and thus the sage of old attained the wondrous return to nothingness. Alas! The entire *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* is contained herein.\n\nI have long held that the supreme Dao is not cumbersome, and so I once expressed it through diagrams and eulogies without daring to exhaust its meaning. One day, my nephew Jiancheng Xing arrived from Hangzhou and told me that he had recently met Master Du of Nangu. Their discussions often aligned with my diagrams and eulogies, and so he obtained Master Du’s work, *The Original Purport*. Upon reading it, I sighed that no one in this world had ever discussed these matters with such resonance—every word struck a chord within. It speaks of the mysterious as seemingly nonexistent, yet existence itself is again mysterious, seemingly existent yet nonexistent, the heaven that gives birth to all things. From this great revelation, the heaven of spontaneity endures, hidden yet ever-present.\n\nIt states: \"Within the emptiness of the Supreme Ultimate dwells the Valley Spirit.\" The valley’s emptiness, responsive and good, is the heart; the spirit’s stillness, numinous and true, is nature. It declares: \"The Supreme Ultimate is the primordial undifferentiated Great One; the Limitless is the formless Great Void before the Supreme Ultimate.\" It further says: \"Of the ten aspects of the Dao as a thing, the Supreme Ultimate is one.\" All these are profound discourses. As the saying goes, \"Build a cart behind closed doors, and it will match the tracks when taken out\"—truly so!\n\nIf one encounters a work like this, the causes and effects of past and present become instantly clear. Within the five thousand words of the *Laozi*, its principles are thoroughly expounded and elucidated, confirming that this is no empty rhetoric. Lord Lao’s Dao extends beyond the earliest beginnings; his spirit roams the boundless ancient past. He lived through the late Zhou dynasty, witnessing all the changes under heaven. To leave teachings for ten thousand generations—what benevolence and righteousness could surpass this? Yet some criticize it without reflection.\n\nGenerally, the Dao and its virtue are spoken of in terms of the Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate, while benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust are expressed through yin-yang and the Five Phases. The sage’s treatment of heaven, earth, and the myriad things as straw dogs is deemed \"without benevolence,\" yet this aligns with the Six Classics’ nurturing of benevolence. Consider the discussions on \"supreme virtue and supreme benevolence,\" \"losing the Dao and losing virtue,\" \"rejecting benevolence and abandoning wisdom\"—these describe the progression from the August to the Emperor, from the Emperor to the King. The Dao rises and falls, while the hegemons usurp benevolence, steal righteousness, and falsify propriety through cunning. *The Original Purport* truly grasps this meaning.\n\nMoreover, it states that the Dao governs the fate of the people, unaware of the life-giving power of benevolence, the growth fostered by propriety, the completion brought by righteousness—only the concealment of wisdom is esteemed. This is like a year without spring, summer, or autumn, perpetually in winter. How profound!\n\nAlas! The flow of the heavenly Dao and the shifts of the worldly Dao, once gone, do not return—such is the inevitable trend. To adapt and preserve them lies with humanity, and thus this classic was composed. It says: \"Its essence is most true; within it lies sincerity.\" The sincerity of the Five Constants is the earth of the Five Phases; the Dao of the Prior Heaven’s Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate cannot be altered by ten thousand changes—this is what is called *cheng* (integrity). Having gathered the essential purport of the classic to cultivate nature and conduct, I append it at the end of the scroll.\n\nWritten by Li Liwu of Xigu, on the Shangyuan Festival of the *yisi* year of the Dade era.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface by Zhang Yucai**\n\nThe eighty-one chapters of the *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* have been annotated by over three thousand scholars. Master Du of Nangu’s *Original Purport* begins with \"The Purport of the Mysterious Classic,\" primarily addressed to rulers. It further states that the sage Lao composed the *Mysterious Classic* to elucidate the august Dao and the imperial virtue. Its grand principles and essential themes are made clear from the very first scroll.\n\nIn this world, the classic, when unfolded, fills the six directions; when rolled up, it enters the tiniest speck of dust. Its essence cannot be confined to one corner. *The Original Purport* grasps its greatness, and thus its lesser aspects cannot contradict it.\n\nI have heard that Master Du of Nangu once accompanied Dongming in an imperial audience. Though he harbored earnest intentions, he did not have the chance to present this work. Perhaps his lifelong aspirations could not be expressed in his time, so he entrusted them to later generations. Those who obtain this work will achieve governance surpassing even that of Emperor Wen of Han. Master Du is truly extraordinary!\n\nWritten by Zhang Yucai, Inheritor of the Heavenly Master, on the Minor Snow of the *yisi* year of the Dade era.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface by Mou Yan**\n\nIn the cramped and dusty world, my heart is often troubled, and conversing with ordinary people brings no joy. When Master Du of Nangu arrived by boat, our discussions were transcendent, lifting my spirits. Together, we ascended the Cloud Peak of the Daoist sanctuary and lodged there. At midnight, by the light of a flickering lamp, he showed me his *Original Purport of Laozi*. I read through the night until dawn.\n\nMaster Du has studied extensively across all texts, and his work does more than merely elucidate the classic’s essential purport. On one chapter, he remarked, \"This pertains to the affairs of Yao and Shun.\" On another, he said, \"This concerns the deeds of Yu, King Wen, and King Wu.\" His interpretation treats Laozi as the Archivist of the Zhou, whose duty was to record history—and the hundred-chapter book is also history. Thus, he approached it through historical inquiry, which astonished me.\n\nEver since Sima Qian placed Laozi and Han Fei in the same biography, dissatisfaction has lingered for a thousand years. He Shanggong’s commentary on the *Laozi* frequently touches on breathing exercises and guiding-and-pulling techniques. Later, scholars like Sun Deng, Tao Hongjing, the Immortal of Pine Spirit, the Tang Daoist Cheng Xuanying, and Zhang Junxiang also annotated the *Laozi*. More recently, the immortalist Wang Fusi used the *Laozi* to interpret the *Yijing*, which some criticized. Yet his interpretation of the *Laozi* itself made no reference to the *Yijing*.\n\nTo Su Ziyou, who directly regarded it as an inheritance of enlightenment, a transmission of the lamp of the Śākya clan—how could the *Laozi* have foreseen that its later currents would reach such a state? Now, Master Du seeks it through the books of emperors and kings, cross-referencing it with their deeds. It is as if one emerges from darkness into light, from obscurity into grandeur, where the atmosphere and vision suddenly transform—how could this not be most fitting? Some say this is merely his *Origins of the Dao* commentary.\n\nAlas, the world has yet to discern Master Du’s true intent. For long has the Way been fragmented, each clinging to their own biases, vying to establish sects, even preserving remnants and guarding gaps to disparage others. None are willing to set aside their prejudices and seek the convergence of truth. Though Master Du titles his work *Original Purport*, he does not adhere to a single school. He harmonizes only with principle, follows only the classics, and venerates only what is correct, striving to leave no room for doubt in later generations regarding his master’s teachings. Such is his intent—truly magnanimous. How could it fundamentally differ from the *Origins of the Dao*?\n\nI, being of limited understanding, have not deeply examined the *Original Purport*, but I shall briefly discuss its general meaning.\n\nScholars of the Laozi’s teachings invariably favor Laozi over Confucius. The followers of Liezi and Zhuangzi go so far as to exalt their masters by disparaging Yao, Shun, and Confucius, using them as foils. Thus, Confucians label them as heterodox, and the teachings of Confucius and Laozi diverge into two paths. Yet the Laozi’s teachings were not inherently at odds with Confucianism. Its Way transcends being to function in non-being, gathering emptiness to transform the substantial, directly aiming to replace sagely wisdom and benevolence with a world of plain simplicity. Confucians often recoil at its radical renunciations, but how could they know whether such words are feigned or genuine?\n\nWhen its principles are applied well, the Western Han governed through tranquility. When followed poorly to the extreme, the Western Jin perished through vacuity. Must one abandon all restraints and standards to claim it differs from what I call the Way?\n\nMaster Du of Nangu, in his study of this teaching, does not interpret the Laozi’s text through Daoist doctrines. Instead, he draws from Confucianism to illuminate it. Through meticulous analysis of chapters and phrases, he ensures coherence without fragmentation, preferring not to dissect it piecemeal. By drawing analogies and comparing meanings, he fully incorporates the Way of the Five Emperors, the Three Kings, and the teachings of Confucius and Mencius into his explanations. It is like the five colors adapting to their subjects, blending harmoniously into brilliance; like the five notes, high and low, clear and deep, resonating to form a perfect melody; like thirty spokes converging at a single hub, each taking different paths east and west, yet ultimately aligning in their tracks. In my view, his work achieves unity.\n\nThe Laozi’s teachings aspire to restore the governance of knotted cords—a practice of Fuxi and Shen Nong from the distant past. Its discourse on the Valley Spirit traces back to the Yellow Emperor; its esteem for non-action resembles Shun; its valuing of humility and lack of boasting mirrors Yu. Countless subtle words and profound meanings align with the Six Classics. Observing the convergence of all schools, to claim Confucius and Laozi do not belong to the same tradition—I do not believe it.\n\nMaster Du, as one who has heard the Dao and progressed from subtlety to wonder, harmonizing differences into unity, embodies what Sima Qian called the Daoist spirit: single-minded, yet incorporating the strengths of Confucianism. Is this not so?\n\nIn my youth, when I first took office in Wuxing, I once drifted along Fengxi. Now, in old age, one day Master Du sent a letter through a mutual friend, presenting me with his *Original Purport*. Though I have not fully grasped its meaning, I privately admire his exhaustive and erudite synthesis.\n\nReaders should examine it in detail for themselves.\n\nWritten by the remnant subject Xu Tianyu, courtesy name Siwanfu, at Yichu Mountain Studio.\n\nI recall Sima Qian’s record of the Western Capital during the reign of Emperor Wen of Han, when the people lived in joy, and elders of sixty or seventy played like children. The prosperity of that golden age can still be imagined. Was this not the result of studying the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s teachings of tranquility? Yet the Han is not our only evidence.\n\nThe essence of the Laozi’s text lies in non-action and non-contention. These were the practices of the ancient sage-kings, which even Tang and Wu found difficult to uphold. As the Zhou declined, a purple aura crossed the pass westward. Moved by the times, Laozi composed his five thousand words, then departed, concealing his intent and deepening his hopes for the age. Once the text spread, it naturally found adherents. Yet its scholars—whether wielding the harsh techniques of Legalism or the abstruse theories of immortality—failed to mutually illuminate, instead turning to mutual criticism. Moreover, with hundreds of commentaries, few have truly grasped the original meaning of the classic.\n\nMaster Du of Nangu’s *Original Purport*, the last to emerge, decisively declares: This is my master’s exploration of ancient history, expounding the Way of Fuxi, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun. As Laozi served as the Archivist of the Zhou, the past was not distant, and the governance of \"wearing robes and knotting cords\" remained vividly before his eyes. No record is more trustworthy than history. To verify it through ancient history and make it easily credible—this truly begins with Master Du.\n\nBan Gu described Daoists as \"vacuous and self-contained,\" aligning with Yao’s abdication, yet overlooking the ruler’s role. His *Treatise on the Nine Schools* separates Confucianism from Daoism, tracing the Dao’s origin to the Heavenly Sage. Yet the Sage’s transmission—nameless, designated only as the Dao—was later monopolized as a school. Was this truly Laozi’s intent? If his teachings were applied today, they would purely return to the ancient Way of Confucius, offering great assistance.\n\nMaster Du, hailing from the Confucian tradition yet studying the Laozi’s teachings, does not favor one over the other but reconciles both. How admirable! Though I am dull and have not fully grasped his intent, I hope one day to retreat to the mountains, sharing a patch of land beneath the white clouds, to resolve doubts and clarify uncertainties—perhaps gaining insight beyond mere words and texts.\n\nWritten by Wang Yijian, courtesy name Lidefu, of Shanyin.\n\n*Original Purport of the Mysterious Classic of Dao and Virtue*, Volume One\nAnnotated by Du Daojian, Eminent Scholar of the Daoist Teachings of Dangtu\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nNameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad things.\nThrough constant non-being, one observes its mystery.\nThrough constant being, one observes its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet differ in name;\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound and again profound—\nThe gateway to all mysteries.\n\nThe *Original Purport* states:\nHeaven is the ancestor of all things; the Dao is the ancestor of Heaven.\nHeaven does not speak of the Dao—how can it be spoken? What can be spoken is not the Dao.\nIt is said: \"Cannot be spoken, cannot be named\"—this is the natural Heaven, constant and unchanging.\nThis is prior to Heaven.\nThat which \"can be spoken, can be named\" is the Heaven that generates things, changing yet not constant.\nThis is posterior to Heaven.\nHere we see the beginning of Heaven and Earth, the mother of the myriad things, the evidence of mystery, the interplay of being and non-being—again profound, encompassing the primordial origin of great transformation, leaving nothing unincluded.\nObserving the mystery of constant non-being, one perceives the nameless beginning.\nPerceiving the nameless beginning, one sees the Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate.\nObserving the manifestations of constant being, one perceives the named mother.\nPerceiving the named mother, one sees the Two Modes and the myriad things.\nThese two originally share the same beginning, emerge from the same mother, yet differ in name.\nDoubling them again and again, one perceives the profound and again profound—\nThe gateway to all mysteries.\nThe Heaven that generates things becomes manifest through this.\nThe natural Heaven remains subtly enduring.\nAbove form, below form—Heaven is this Dao, I am this Dao.\nWords beyond words, names beyond names—what need is there for more speech?\nHeaven does not speak; the sage also wishes to remain silent. Alas!\nLofty words do not reach the hearts of the multitude; ultimate words do not surpass common speech.\nThus, the sage does not speak, yet cannot but speak.\nWhen the mysterious sage journeyed west, the Keeper of the Pass, Yin Xi, knowing that the great Dao was about to withdraw, compelled him to write a book.\nReluctantly, he spoke, saying:\n\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\"\nMaster Guan Yin said: \"The Dao cannot be spoken; if it cannot be spoken, then the correct Dao is precisely this.\"\nThis is the explanation of the Dao.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, the two qi recombine as one—this is called the harmonious void.\nThe harmonious void embodies the essence of the Supreme Ultimate, the root of generation and transformation.\nThe Three Powers are established, and the human Dao arises.\nThe *Book* states: \"Only Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things; only humans are the spirits of the myriad things.\"\nFrom constant non-being upward, we speak of the Dao of Heaven; below, we speak of the human Dao.\nIf one can observe the Dao of Heaven and cultivate the human Dao, there is none who will not enter the realm of the sage.\nThe *Classic of the Hidden Correspondence* states: \"Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the movements of Heaven—this is perfection.\"\nConstant non-being is prior to Heaven; observing mystery, one sees the inherent self.\nConstant being is posterior to Heaven; observing manifestations, one sees the undying self.\nTracing its beginning, formless gives rise to form; tracing its end, form returns to formlessness.\nObserving the comings and goings of daily affairs and the movements of the heart-mind, none lie outside this Dao.\nThese two emerge from the same Dao yet differ in name.\nTheir sameness lies in this Dao.\nThe profound is one yet two, two yet one.\nThe profound seems non-being yet is being; again profound, it seems being yet is non-being—this is the myriad things.\nThe gateway implies entry and exit: the myriad things emerge from the mechanism and return to the mechanism.\nThe body contains Heaven and Earth; the heart-mind contains the Supreme Ultimate.\nKnowing, yet never born; never dying.\nAlas! The heart-mind of the sage is the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth.\nObserving the morning mists and evening clouds of Heaven and Earth, ever-changing yet impermanent, while the great void remains unchanged—\nOne knows that when the sage responds to the myriad affairs, his heart-mind is quiescent, and his celestial nature remains undisturbed.\nI have often said: Heaven and Earth are the great body; my body is the small Heaven and Earth.\nLike Yao’s boundless virtue—\n\"The people could not name it\"—\nThis may be called the sagely person of the Dao.\nThe *Classic* states:\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other;\nDifficulty and ease complete each other;\nLong and short shape each other;\nHigh and low incline toward each other;\nSound and voice harmonize with each other;\nFront and back follow each other.\nTherefore, the sage dwells in non-action and practices the teaching without words.\nThe myriad things arise, yet he does not reject them;\nHe gives life yet does not possess;\nHe acts yet does not rely;\nHe accomplishes yet does not dwell.\nOnly because he does not dwell does he not depart.\n\nThe *Original Purport* states:\nThe Dao stands alone, without counterpart; once there is duality, it becomes a thing.\nThings take form, and beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness arise.\nIf Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak of it, if Yao possesses great goodness yet does not know it—\nThen what ugliness or not-goodness could there be?\nOnce there is self-pride or self-promotion, a desire for others to know oneself—\nBeauty becomes ugliness, goodness becomes not-goodness.\nHow much more so if one desires all under Heaven to know?\nThe ancients, when possessing goodness, feared others knowing.\nToday, when possessing goodness, one fears others not knowing.\nHow shallow this is!\nThe purport of the *Mysterious Classic* was originally addressed to the ruler.\nThe ruler is the teacher and elder of all under Heaven.\nWhat the ruler above favors, those below will follow.\nThe *Book* states: \"Following the good brings fortune; following the perverse brings misfortune—like an echo following sound.\"\nAlas! It is not the shadow that moves the form, but the form that moves the shadow.\nIt is not the valley that moves the sound, but the sound that moves the valley.\nCan one not be cautious about this?\nThus, being and non-being, difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, sound and voice, front and back—\nThese six pairs give rise to and complete each other, shape and incline toward each other, harmonize and follow each other.\nAll possess duality—this is the inevitable principle.\nTherefore, the sage acts through non-action and teaches without words.\n\nNon-action does not mean inaction, but acting without contrivance. Non-speaking does not mean silence, but sparing the trouble of decrees and admonitions. Allowing the people and all things to act, grow, and function on their own—without refusal, possession, or reliance—thus can one achieve the work of nurturing life. When the work is accomplished, one does not claim credit, and so the merit does not depart. Should it be otherwise, the merit will vanish.\n\nThe *Classic* refers to sages only from the sovereigns of remote antiquity down to Yao; thereafter, it speaks of kings, dukes, marquises, good men, noble persons, and great men. Distinctions in virtue are made, and praise or censure is implied—scholars must view this with the eyes of the ancients, observing the era before the Zhou and the Warring States.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nDo not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend.\nDo not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal.\nDo not display what is desirable, and the people’s hearts will not be disordered.\nThus, in the sage’s governance, he empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their ambitions, and strengthens their bones, ever keeping the people without cunning or desire. He ensures that the clever dare not act; by acting through non-action, nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe ancient sage composed the *Mysterious Classic* to illuminate the imperial Dao and the virtue of emperors. The world is vast, and things are manifold—what exists in the world must not exist in me. If those above exalt their own superiority over others, prize rare goods, or display their desires, then those below will take these three as their hearts’ aims: they will contend, steal, and create disorder. Only when I have no desires will they, though rewarded, not covet. Thus, in governing the world, the sage must first empty his own mind, not obstructing affairs; fill his own belly, not allowing evil to enter; weaken his own ambitions, not competing with things; and strengthen his own bones, not opposing with force. He constantly keeps the people from transgressive knowledge and usurping desires. Even if there were one as wise as the giant Longbo, who could hook the six great turtles, he would not dare to commit the slightest transgression or usurpation—how then could there be rebellious ministers or treacherous sons? The rulers of remote antiquity governed the world by acting without contrivance, and so nothing remained ungoverned.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nAbysmal! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\nBlunting its sharpness, untying its tangles,\nHarmonizing its light, uniting with its dust—\nProfound! It seems ever present.\nI know not whose child it is; it seems the image of what preceded the Lord.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThat which governs Heaven and Earth and administers the myriad things is the mind. The mind is the pivot of the Dao; all people possess this mind, and in this mind, the Dao resides. Only through its empty subtlety and wondrous function, its abysmal stillness and capacity, can it embrace the six directions without appearing full. Its knowledge pervades the myriad things without departing from its source. Once this Dao is obscured by things, the mind becomes as if blocked by thatch. When responding to affairs and engaging with things, one must first rectify what lies within, and then what lies without will not disturb. At the first hint of entanglement or sharpness disturbing the center, one must blunt and untie it. When purity is thorough, one can harmonize light and dust, coexisting without conflict. Thus, one’s empty subtlety and wondrous function, luminous and penetrating, lie hidden within—profound, as if ever present. To regard it as mine, I know not whose child it is; to regard it as not mine, it yet resembles the image of what preceded my spirit and lord. Unless one is clear and bright, with a spirit-like will and qi, who could comprehend this?\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not benevolent; he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nThe space between Heaven and Earth—is it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it produces.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion; it is better to hold to the center.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nHeaven’s duty is to cover, Earth’s duty is to bear, and the sage’s duty is to transform. Enabling the myriad things and the hundred clans to each fulfill their lives, and though they accomplish this, they do not regard it as benevolence—such is the utmost benevolence. Not regarding it as benevolence, they have no expectation of reward, and thus, like straw dogs, no thought of discarding things. It is like the state’s sacrificial offerings, where straw dogs are bound for the spirits. During the sacrifice, though the straw dog is humble, it must be set out; once the rite is complete, though the embroidered silk is noble, it must be removed. How could there be a mind that distinguishes between noble and base? It is simply a matter of what is fitting. Moreover, the myriad things and the hundred clans are what Heaven and Earth rely upon to perfect their virtue of covering and bearing, and what the sage relies upon to perfect his work of transformation—how should they be treated? Observe the space between Heaven and Earth, like a bellows: empty yet capacious, it does not exhaust; moving without losing the center, it produces ever more. The sounds of Heaven’s pipes are myriad and different, yet if they arise of themselves, each takes what it will—who is the one who forces them? The sage’s relation to the hundred clans is the same. Should he act much or speak often, issuing frequent decrees, he will soon be exhausted. One must regard Heaven and Earth as a bellows, empty the mind to embody the Dao, and truly hold to the center—this is how Yao, reverent and silent in non-action, treated all equally as straw, and the world was governed.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe valley spirit does not die; it is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nSubtle and continuous, as if present—its use is inexhaustible.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe valley spirit is the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is empty at its center, and the valley spirit resides there. Heaven has this valley spirit, and humans have this valley spirit—its nature as a valley is the same. Mysterious and identical with yin and yang, it embraces and contains creation; its spirit is the wondrous functioning of the myriad things. Only because it does not die can it generate and transform without end. The Mysterious Female is yin and yang.\n\nThe gate is the portal through which Qian and Kun undergo their transformations; the root is the source from which the myriad transformations arise. \"Subtle and continuous, as if present\"—this endures from ancient times to the present without cease. \"Its use is inexhaustible\"—this arises from spontaneity.\n\nThis passage elaborates upon the preceding chapter’s analogy of the bellows and the key to Heaven and Earth, revealing that the Supreme Ultimate within our hearts and the Dao of our bodies as Heaven and Earth flow in unison with the Creator, never born and never dying. The valley’s emptiness responds with perfect receptivity, serving as a metaphor for our hearts. The spirit’s stillness engenders numinosity, serving as an analogy for our nature. In the midst of profound quiescence, one perceives the wondrous resonance of responsiveness—only then is the meaning of \"not dying\" revealed. Yet spirit cannot arise without qi, nor can qi be numinous without spirit. Where spirit is spoken of, qi is already present. When spirit and qi intermingle and merge, only then is the Mysterious Female manifest.\n\nThe Mysterious (Xuan) takes root in Heaven, possessing the virtue of the Father—it is the origin of spirit. The Female (Pin) takes root in Earth, possessing the virtue of the Mother—it is the origin of qi. Is not the Mysterious Female the Heaven and Earth within our bodies? The gate is where spirit and qi return to their origin, the place of their interaction, as if something were present. Inhaling and exhaling, yet none perceive the gate—thus may the opening and closing of our bodies be seen. The root is where spirit and qi return to their origin, the ground of their intermingling, as if something were present. Generation after generation, transformation after transformation, yet none perceive the root—thus may the Supreme Ultimate within our bodies be seen. Observing its \"as if present\" within the continuous flow, one finds its \"inexhaustible use.\" From this, we may understand how the Old Sage, spanning the Shang and Zhou dynasties for over nine hundred years, mastered the essentials of cultivating the Dao and nurturing longevity—all encompassed herein.\n\nThe *Liezi* also contains this passage, though it attributes it not to Laozi but to the Yellow Emperor. The *Book* states: It is evident that Laozi’s *Five Thousand Characters* draws extensively from the ancient words of the *Canon* and *Classic*. For instance, wherever the *Classic* speaks of \"therefore the sage,\" \"what the ancients called,\" \"it is said in established teachings,\" \"thus the sages declared,\" or \"there are words on the use of arms,\" it clearly cites the transmitted sayings of the ancient sages. Thus, Confucius, though he \"transmitted but did not create,\" subtly aligned himself with them. Only those who \"believe in and delight in antiquity\" may be spoken to of this Dao.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nHeaven is eternal, Earth enduring.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and enduring\nIs that they do not live for themselves—\nThus they can long endure.\nTherefore the sage places himself last yet finds himself first,\nConsiders himself external yet finds himself preserved.\nIs it not because he is selfless?\nThus he fulfills his self.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nHeaven’s eternity and Earth’s endurance cannot be surpassed. Yet by what principle do Heaven and Earth attain their long and enduring nature? The heart of Heaven and Earth is one with all things, capable of generating life without taking self-preservation as its own life. Thus, nothing harms them, and they attain long life. Observing this, the sage embodies the Dao in action, free from the slightest trace of self-interest. He knows only to place the world before himself and to internalize the Dao while externalizing his own person. Thus, though he places himself last, he is inevitably first—people push him forward. Though he considers himself external, he is inevitably preserved—nothing harms him. The body is one’s closest possession, yet to place it last and externalize it is fundamentally selfless. By placing oneself last and externalizing oneself, one paradoxically finds oneself first and preserved—self-interest is thus fulfilled. How could the sage intentionally seek self-interest? It is precisely through selflessness that he fulfills his self-interest. The sage governs Heaven and Earth and administers the myriad things, yet never selfishly preserves his own life. Only by not living for himself does the vitality of life endure.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe highest virtue is like water.\nWater benefits the myriad things yet contends not;\nIt dwells in places all others disdain—\nThus it is near to the Dao.\nIn dwelling, be like the earth.\nIn the heart, be like the abyss.\nIn association, be like kindness.\nIn speech, be like truth.\nIn governance, be like order.\nIn affairs, be like capability.\nIn action, be like timeliness.\nOnly by not contending\nDoes one avoid blame.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe highest virtue is perfect virtue. The nature of water is perfectly virtuous. The person of highest virtue is humble and lowly, possessing the virtue of water. When Yu served as Minister of Works, he had already grasped the goodness of water’s nature, enabling him to fully realize water’s nature and accomplish the work of regulating the waters. From the highest virtue, he effortlessly entered the realm of the sage. There is no other reason—he simply acted without contrivance. Mencius said, \"No person is without goodness; no water is without downward flow\"—there is indeed a reason for this. Water benefits things without contention, dwelling in places all disdain, thus it is near to the Dao. Water’s virtues are manifold. The *Classic* lists seven; the rest may be inferred by analogy. Abiding where it dwells, it is \"good at dwelling in the earth.\" Clear and deep, undisturbed, it is \"good at the heart like the abyss.\" Moistening things without partiality, it is \"good at association like kindness.\" Flowing downward without change, it is \"good at speech like truth.\" Softness overcoming strength, it is \"good at governance like order.\" Bearing the heavy and floating the light, it is \"good at affairs like capability.\" Waxing and waning without loss, it is \"good at action like timeliness.\" If one can emulate water’s virtue, conduct oneself with goodness, and contend with nothing, what blame could there be? At the moment of Yao’s transmission to Shun and Shun’s to Yu, they should have been most diligent in humility and non-boasting, contending with none. Only Yu was truly worthy of contending for merit.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nTo hold and fill it to the brim\nIs not as good as stopping in time.\nTo hammer and sharpen it to a point\nCannot be long preserved.\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall,\nNone can guard them.\nWealth and honor leading to arrogance\nBring calamity upon oneself.\nWhen merit is achieved and fame established, withdraw—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nHumility leads to increase, fullness to loss; hardness breaks, softness endures—this is the inevitable principle of Heaven. Thus, one who understands the noble must restrain himself, and the sharp must be swiftly blunted—this is the way of the wise in preserving themselves. If one holds fullness without caution or sharpens a point without concealment, the vessel will surely overturn, and the blade will surely break—its inability to be long preserved is clear. When gold and jade fill the hall, who can guard them? Wealth and honor leading to arrogance bring calamity upon oneself.\n\nThose who occupy high positions, bearing heavy seals of office, grow arrogant, extravagant, dissolute, and insatiable—never knowing moderation or contentment. When the tripod shatters and the cauldron overturns, none can preserve their vital essence, and all perish without meeting a natural end. How much better is the gourd on Mount Ji or the single boat on the Five Lakes! Thus we know: merit need not be great—only those who know when to stop succeed. Fame need not be lofty—only those who know contentment attain fulfillment.\n\nHow few in this world escape the net of profit, break free from the tether of fame, withdraw from the rushing current, and preserve themselves in accord with the Dao of Heaven! To achieve merit and retire—this is the Dao of Heaven, grasped only by Yao and Shun.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nCarry your soul and embrace the One—can you never part from it?\nConcentrate your qi and attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?\nPurify and refine your profound vision—can you be without blemish?\nLove the people and govern the state—can you do so without action?\nThe gates of Heaven open and close—can you remain feminine?\nUnderstand the four directions—can you do so without knowledge?\nGive life and nurture, yet do not possess;\nAct, yet do not rely;\nLead, yet do not dominate—\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nOnly by cultivating the self can one govern the state, for the self is like the state, and the hundred limbs like the multitude. Thus the noble person cannot but cultivate the self. Human life carries the soul and embraces the One—can it hold them without separation? If not separated, it becomes One. Qi is the master of the hundred limbs; concentrate your qi and attain suppleness—can you be like an infant? If like an infant, you attain suppleness. The profound cannot be seen; purify and refine your vision—can you be without blemish? Without blemish, you attain the profound. To love the people and govern the state, value preservation and peace—can you do so without action? Without action, you attain peace. The gates of Heaven open and close; value stillness and guard it—can you remain feminine? If feminine, you attain stillness. To understand the four directions, value unimpeded clarity—can you do so without knowledge? Without knowledge, you are not obstructed.\n\nOne who embodies these six attainments, cultivating the self and governing the state, gives life through the Dao and nurtures through virtue. Each thing and self attains its natural course—giving life, acting, leading, yet not possessing, not relying, not dominating. This is why the people of Emperor Yao knew nothing, understood nothing, and asked, \"What has the emperor’s power to do with us?\"—this is called profound virtue.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThirty spokes share one hub;\nWhere it is empty, lies the use of the wheel.\nClay is shaped into a vessel;\nWhere it is empty, lies the use of the vessel.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room;\nWhere it is empty, lies the use of the room.\nThus, being serves as advantage,\nNon-being serves as use.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe sage observes images to create tools, benefiting the world—there is wisdom in this. Movement is round, stillness square—these are the images of Heaven and Earth. Their emptiness is their use. Qi forms the sun, moon, and stars; shape forms mountains, rivers, and plants. Being exists within non-being, non-being within being—nothing is excluded. Thirty spokes share one hub: the wheel’s roundness images Heaven, the carriage’s square images Earth—this is the \"being\" of the cart. Its emptiness is its \"non-being.\" Where it is empty lies the cart’s use. Observing how the hollow hub turns and the empty carriage bears, we see that form serves the advantage of the formless, and the formless serves the use of form—its wonder lies therein.\n\nThe *Classic* speaks of the wheel’s spokes and hub but not of the wheel, carriage, shaft, or traces—yet in speaking of the cart, its entirety is implied. The same principle applies to shaping clay into vessels or cutting doors and windows to make a room. The Dao speaks of being and non-being, the *Book of Changes* of movement and stillness—both are one. Clarify the non-being of the Dao, and you see the stillness of the *Changes*. Clarify the movement of the *Changes*, and you see the being of the Dao. The meaning of being and non-being, the mechanism of movement and stillness—how vast they are!\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate,\nRacing and hunting madden the mind,\nRare goods corrupt conduct.\nThus the sage is for the belly, not the eyes—\nTherefore he rejects that and chooses this.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nWhen the sage is above, he serves as a model for the people, and the world follows his example. What those above favor, those below emulate—like wind and cloud responding to dragon and tiger, or water and fire to moisture and dryness, without need for summoning. Thus, whatever is vain, extravagant, and harmful to the people’s livelihood is rejected and not chosen.\n\nKnowing that the five colors dazzle and blind the eyes, he does not pursue adornment but guards purity and simplicity. Knowing that the five tones confuse and deafen the ears, he does not indulge in lewd music but guards silence and stillness. Knowing that the five flavors cloy and dull the palate, he does not seek delicacies but guards frugality and plainness. Knowing that racing and hunting madden the mind, he does not indulge in frivolous amusements but guards tranquility and constancy. Knowing that rare goods corrupt conduct, he does not pursue worldly treasures but guards the Heavenly nobility.\n\nThese five are all extravagances that agitate the true nature and harm the people’s livelihood—no benefit to sustaining life. They are not the way of filling the belly, strengthening the root, and enduring long. Thus the sage values the substance of the belly, not the splendor of the eyes. Therefore he rejects that and chooses this, practicing frugality himself to encourage the people. He seeks to transform the world naturally, so each person is content, no external desires usurp their nature, and the world is governed.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nFavor and disgrace are both startling;\nRegard great calamity as you do your body.\nWhat is meant by \"favor and disgrace are both startling\"?\nFavor is lowly—\nTo gain it is startling, to lose it is startling—\nThis is what is meant by \"favor and disgrace are both startling.\"\nWhat is meant by \"regard great calamity as you do your body\"?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nIs that I have a body.\nIf I had no body,\nWhat calamity could I have?\nThus, one who values the self as the world\nMay be entrusted with the world;\nOne who loves the self as the world\nMay be charged with the world.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe sage values the self through the Dao, while the multitude values the self through fame—how vastly different they are!\n\nTo value the self through the Dao is non-action. To value the self through fame is to act without cease for the self. Favor and disgrace are both startling—where there is favor, there is disgrace; how could one not be startled? To regard great calamity as one does the self: whether valuing the self or valuing fame, the calamity is the same.\n\nWhat is meant by \"favor and disgrace\"? Favor is lowly, and fame is thereby manifest. To gain it is startling, to lose it is startling—fearing loss and coveting gain, both are equally startling. What is meant by \"regarding great calamity as one does the self\"? The reason I have great calamity is that I have a self, and having a self means clinging to things. Clinging to things, one cannot escape the burden of fame. Without a self, one forgets things; forgetting things, the burden of fame is cast off. This is spoken for those who value the self through fame. The sage values the self through the Dao—what weariness could there be?\n\nKnowing fame is not worth valuing, one sees the value of the self. Knowing the self is not worth valuing, one sees the value of the Dao. Seeing the value of the Dao, what calamity could I have? When Han and Wei contended over land, Master Zihua advised Marquis Zhaoxi to cast off his two arms in exchange for the world. The marquis refused—thus his two arms were heavier than the world. The self is heavier than two arms, and the Dao is heavier still than the self.\n\nWhen the noble person is compelled to govern the world, they must be able to value the self as the world—such valuing may entrust them with the world. To love the self as the world—such love may charge them with the world. \"Valuing\" speaks of position; \"loving\" speaks of virtue. Valuing position allows one to be entrusted; loving virtue allows one to be charged. Yet knowing position may be relinquished while virtue cannot, then favor and disgrace become light—what calamity could I have?\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nLook and it cannot be seen—it is called *Yi*.\nListen and it cannot be heard—it is called *Xi*.\nGrasp and it cannot be held—it is called *Wei*.\nThese three cannot be fathomed,\nThus they merge into one.\nAbove, it is not bright;\nBelow, it is not dark.\nEndless, it cannot be named,\nReturning to nothingness.\nThis is called the formless form,\nThe imageless image,\nCalled the indistinct and evanescent.\nMeet it and you do not see its beginning;\nFollow it and you do not see its end.\nHold to the ancient Dao\nTo master the present being.\nTo know the ancient beginning\nIs called the thread of the Dao.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nOne cannot but know the Dao; the Dao cannot but know the ancient. The ancient must have a beginning, and the beginning must have something. The things of the world are many—what thing is not the Dao? What Dao is not a thing? It cannot be named. Seek it by sight, by hearing, by grasping—*Yi*, unseen; *Xi*, unheard; *Wei*, unobtainable. Question it with words, yet it cannot be reached, thus it merges into one. Observe its above—it is not bright; observe its below—it is not dark. Endless, it cannot be named; once named, it returns to nothingness. The formless form, the imageless image, indistinct and evanescent—meet it and you do not see its beginning; follow it and you do not see its end. Thereby one sees that nothing is not the Dao, and no Dao is not a thing—the Dao is thus. If one can hold to this ancient, wondrously formless Dao to govern the wondrously formed present, not only may one perfect the self, but may also order the world, returning all to the Dao. Who would then be bound by things?\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe ancients who were good as scholars\nWere subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating,\nToo deep to be known.\nIt is only because they could not be known\nThat I force descriptions of them:\nHesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;\nCautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;\nReserved, as if a guest;\nYielding, as ice about to melt;\nSimple, as uncarved wood;\nVast, as a valley;\nOpaque, as muddy water.\nWho can make the muddy clear through stillness?\nWho can make the still come to life through movement?\nOne who preserves this Dao does not desire fullness.\nIt is only because they are not full\nThat they can be worn yet newly made.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe ancients who were good as scholars embraced the Dao and dwelled in constancy, cultivating hidden virtue, flowing with the world without self-importance. They attained the subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating principle, which the multitude could not know. Only because they could not be known do I force descriptions of them—like the seven \"as ifs\" below, all embodying the mean, neither leaning nor drifting.\n\nHesitant, as if crossing a winter stream—no hasty advance.\nCautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides—no reckless movement.\nReserved, as if a guest—no wantonness.\nYielding, as ice about to melt—no rigidity.\nSimple, as uncarved wood—no adornment.\nVast, as a valley—no obstruction.\nOpaque, as muddy water—no artifice.\n\nWho can make the muddy clear through stillness? Who can make the still come to life through movement? The order and disorder, safety and danger of human affairs are like the waxing and waning of heaven’s way—movement reaches its extreme and turns to stillness; stillness reaches its extreme and turns to movement. Had Qu Yuan known this Dao, his loyalty would not have led to drowning. Had Bo Yi known this Dao, his purity would not have led to starvation. Thus it is said: One who preserves this Dao does not desire fullness, having no insistence on fulfilling the self. Only without insisting on fulfilling the self can one be worn yet newly made—speaking of abiding in constancy without great change. The Old Sage passed through the two dynasties of Shang and Zhou, thrice parted at the Pass, four times entered the archives, wandering for over nine hundred years, and in his later years journeyed to the shifting sands—none knew his end. This is how to be good.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nAttain utmost emptiness,\nAbide in profound stillness.\nThe ten thousand things arise together,\nAnd I observe their return.\nThings flourish abundantly,\nEach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nStillness is called returning to life;\nReturning to life is called constancy.\nKnowing constancy is called illumination.\nNot knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.\nKnowing constancy, one is all-embracing;\nAll-embracing, one is impartial;\nImpartial, one is kingly;\nKingly, one is heavenly;\nHeavenly, one is of the Dao;\nOf the Dao, one is enduring.\nTo the end of life, one is not imperiled.\n\n*The Original Purport* states:\nBefore the ten thousand things, there was Heaven and Earth;\nbefore Heaven and Earth, there was the Supreme Polarity;\nbefore the Supreme Polarity, there was utter emptiness and perfect stillness—\nan unformed One abiding therein, which is the root of Heaven and Earth.\nYet it does not speak of attaining the Supreme Polarity but of governing utmost emptiness,\nfor utmost emptiness is the Nameless.\nAt the inception of utmost emptiness and profound stillness,\nthe ten thousand things arise together,\nand I observe their return—\nthus the heart of Heaven and Earth is revealed.\nThings flourish abundantly,\neach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nstillness is called returning to life;\nreturning to life is called constancy.\nKnowing constancy is called illumination.\nFrom this perspective,\nmy own return to the root and restoration to life\nreveal their constancy and illumination.\nNot knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune—\none strays far from the Dao.\nKnowing constancy, one is all-embracing—\nstillness and emptiness.\nAll-embracing, one is impartial—\nemptiness and vastness.\nImpartial, one is kingly—\nvastness to which all under Heaven return.\nKingly, one is heavenly—\nman models himself on Heaven.\nHeavenly, one is of the Dao—\nHeaven models itself on the Dao.\nOf the Dao, one is enduring—\nthe Dao models itself on spontaneity.\nTo the end of life, one is not imperiled—\nthus it is clear that before the Supreme Polarity,\nthere abides an utterly empty, perfectly still, unformed One,\nand in its imperilment lies its enduring nature.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nOf the highest,\nthose below merely know of its existence.\nNext,\nthey draw near and praise it.\nNext,\nthey fear it and revile it.\nWhere trust is insufficient,\nthere is distrust.\nHow solemnly it treasures its words!\nIts work complete, its affairs accomplished,\nthe hundred clans say, \"We are naturally so.\"\n\n*The Original Purport* states:\nIn the age of remote antiquity,\nmen dwelt in nests and caves,\nfree from taxes, levies, and corvée labor,\nfrom rites, music, punishments, and laws,\nfrom canons, models, instructions, and admonitions.\nThose below knew only that a ruler existed above,\nand those above knew only that the people existed below—\nall was harmonious, spontaneous, and non-action.\nNext, the Three Sovereigns introduced the first stroke,\nestablished writing and contracts,\nand taught the people the use of nets, plows, boats, and carts—\nthus the world first had action.\nThe people reaped its benefits,\nand the world drew near.\nNext, the Five Emperors instituted rites, music, laws, and measures—\nthe people gained security,\nand the world praised them.\nNext, Qi attacked Youhu, Tang exiled Jie, and King Wu overthrew Zhou—\nweapons were drawn,\nand the world feared them.\nNext, King Zhao marched south, King Yi descended the hall, King Ping moved east,\nand men inquired about the cauldrons and challenged succession—\nthe world reviled them.\nThis arose from nothing else:\nthe trust of those above in those below was insufficient,\nand the trust of those below in those above was lacking.\nIn the governance of Tang Yao,\nthe people knew not and could not name it—\nwhat words were there to treasure?\nAs the saying goes: \"The highest establishes virtue;\nnext, merit;\nnext, words\"—\nthese are not sought but arise of necessity.\nAlas! From remote antiquity to the Five Hegemons,\nobserving how those below knew of its existence, drew near, praised, feared, or reviled it—\nin a few words, not a single ancient name is mentioned,\nyet it encompasses thousands of generations,\nimplicitly discernible—\ntruly profound indeed!\nThus I know this is the nameless ancient history.\n\nGuanzi also said: In the governance of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang,\nall under Heaven called it \"natural.\"\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nWhen the Great Dao declined, there arose benevolence and righteousness.\nWhen wisdom and cleverness emerged, there arose great falsity.\nWhen the six relations fell into disharmony, there arose filial piety and compassion.\nWhen the state fell into chaos and disorder, there arose loyal ministers.\n\n*The Original Purport* states:\nWith the rise of the Three Sovereigns, the Great Dao declined—\nthe beginning of the scattering of simplicity.\nWith the Five Emperors, there arose benevolence and righteousness.\nWith the rise of the Three Kings, wisdom and cleverness emerged.\nWith the Five Hegemons, great falsity arose.\nThis continues the purport of the preceding chapter.\nThe sovereign’s Dao, the emperor’s virtue, the king’s wisdom, the hegemon’s falsity—\nas the world’s virtue declined further and grew ever more shallow,\nloyalty and filial piety became manifest.\nWas this not the inevitable flow of Heaven’s course?\nAlas! From the profound antiquity onward, I cannot examine it.\nIn the age of Emperor Yao,\nevery household was worthy of enfeoffment—\nwho were the loyal ministers, who the filial sons?\nYet when Great Shun was unfortunate enough to have a blind father, Gu Sou,\nand a haughty brother, Xiang,\nwho plotted daily to kill him—\nwhether digging a well or repairing a granary—\nShun’s heart remained set on bringing Gu Sou to joy and resolving their enmity.\nOnly through the difficulty of a stubborn father and haughty brother\nis Great Shun’s filial compassion revealed.\nHad Jie not been cruel and oppressive, Longfeng would not have been killed.\nHad Zhou not been lewd and disorderly, Bigan would not have died remonstrating—\nhow else would the loyalty of these ministers be seen?\nThus when kinship is harmonious, the name of filial piety is hidden,\nyet filial piety is never absent.\nWhen the world is well-governed, the name of loyalty is obscured,\nyet loyalty is never absent.\nAlas! When loyalty and filial piety shine forth in the world,\nbenevolence and righteousness are lost and deceit arises—\nhow far this is from the sovereign’s wind!\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nAbandon sageliness and discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.\nAbandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and compassion.\nAbandon skill and discard profit, and there will be no thieves or robbers.\nThese three, as teachings, are insufficient—\nthus let them have something to which to belong:\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nreduce selfishness, diminish desires.\n\n*The Original Purport* states:\nSageliness, wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness are the great roots of the world—\nhow can they be abandoned?\nThis continues the purport of the preceding chapter.\nThe people’s benefit, filial piety, and compassion—\nfrom these arise thieves and robbers.\nIf they knew that ornamentation could be stripped away and simplicity restored,\nthen all who feign sageliness to startle the foolish,\nwield benevolence and righteousness to brandish weapons,\nor employ skill and profit to incite thieves—\nthese would be abandoned.\nLet the people dwell securely, and the land’s benefits will increase a hundredfold.\nLet households have enough for their needs, and the people will return to filial piety and compassion—\nhow could there be thieves?\nIn the late ages of the Three Dynasties,\nthe Dao no longer returned to its ancient source.\nWhat they called the heart of sageliness, wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, skill, and profit\nwas nothing but the theft of the former kings’ model words,\nadorned to deceive the present age—\nas when Tian Cheng murdered his lord and seized the state of Qi—\nwas this not robbery?\n\nThus it is said: these three—when deemed insufficient as cultural adornments—must be made subordinate to something greater. One ought to trace back to the emperors and sovereigns of antiquity, contemplating the restoration of the ancient Way. Outwardly, manifest purity and simplicity; inwardly, embrace unadulterated sincerity. Rectify oneself above to encourage those below. Even if one cannot achieve complete selflessness and desirelessness, one should at least strive for minimal self-interest and few desires, thereby avoiding the conduct of thieves and robbers. When the people’s benefits are sufficient, filial piety and compassion may be restored.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\n*\"Abandon learning, and there will be no worries.\"*\nBetween \"yea\" and \"nay,\" how great is the distance?\nBetween good and evil, what is the difference?\nWhat people fear cannot but be feared.\nVast and boundless—how endless it seems!\n\nThe multitude bustles and rejoices,\nas if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nas if ascending the springtime terrace.\nI alone remain cautious, as yet without sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet learned to smile,\nadrift, as if with no place to return.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nwhile I alone seem to have lost something.\nWhat a fool’s heart I possess!\nSo guileless—\nwhile the common folk are bright and clear,\nI alone seem dim.\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning,\nI alone am dull and muddled.\nVast as the sea, drifting without end,\nstill as if nowhere to abide.\nThe multitude all have their uses,\nwhile I alone seem stubborn and coarse.\nI alone differ from others,\nyet I prize seeking sustenance from the Mother.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe Way of the sage is learning of inner attainment.\nThe way of the world is learning of external acquisition.\nThe sage does not pursue external acquisition, hence:\n*\"Abandon learning, and there will be no worries.\"*\nYet between \"yea\" and \"nay,\" how great is the distance?\nBetween good and evil, what is the difference?\nWhat people fear refers to the multitude and the common folk of later ages—\nthus one cannot but fear them.\nTheir bustling abundance, their brightness and clarity,\nall have their purposes—\nhow vast and boundless it remains!\nFeasting on the grandest sacrifice, ascending the springtime terrace—\ntheir external acquisitions are plain to see.\nI alone remain cautious, as yet without sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet learned to smile,\nadrift, as if with no place to return.\nWhile the multitude all have more than enough,\nI alone seem to have lost something.\nWhat a fool’s heart I possess!\nSo guileless—\nI alone seem dim,\nI alone am dull and muddled,\nvast as the sea, drifting without end,\nstill as if nowhere to abide.\nWhile the multitude all have their uses,\nI alone seem stubborn and coarse.\nI alone differ from others,\nyet I prize seeking sustenance from the Mother.\nThe Mother is the Dao.\nWhat is sought lies within oneself—\nis this not inner attainment?\nAttaining what is inherently one’s own,\none no longer pursues external acquisition.\nWorldly learning may be abandoned,\nand I shall have no worries.\n\n*Original Meaning of the Mysterious Classic of the Dao and Virtue*, Scroll One (concluded)\n#1 Originally written as *chang* (常); according to the context, it should be *di* (帝).\n*Original Meaning of the Mysterious Classic of the Dao and Virtue*, Scroll Two\nCommentary by the Teaching Gate’s Eminent Scholar, Du Daojian of Dangtu\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.\nAs for the Dao as a thing—\nit is only dim, only vague.\nVague yet dim, within it there are images.\nDim yet vague, within it there are things.\nDeep and obscure, within it there is essence.\nIts essence is utterly real,\nwithin it there is sincerity.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nits name has never departed,\nby which we observe the origins of the myriad beings.\nHow do I know the origins of the myriad beings are thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\n\"Great\" means vast. \"Virtue\" means attainment. Attainment within one’s heart is called virtue. \"Bearing\" means capacity. Possessing great virtue, one’s cosmic capacity becomes boundless—following only the Dao, nothing is not encompassed. Thus the origins of the myriad beings may be observed.\nYet what is the Dao as a thing like?\nIt is only dim, only vague.\nVague yet dim, within it there are images—seemingly absent yet present.\nDim yet vague, within it there are things—seemingly present yet absent.\nDeep and obscure, within it there is essence—what is attained within one’s heart.\nIts essence is utterly real—what one inherently possesses.\nWithin it there is sincerity—truly existing within oneself.\nFrom ancient times to the present, its name has never departed,\nfor it has existed since before heaven and earth, since ancient times.\nWhat we forcibly name the Dao remains the same today as of old.\nThe greatness of heaven and earth, the multitude of the myriad beings—\nby this, all are complete within me.\nHow then do I know the origins of the myriad beings are thus?\nBy observing with what my heart has itself attained—this is how it may be known.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nBent, then whole; crooked, then straight;\nhollow, then full; worn, then new;\nlittle, then attained; much, then confused.\nThus the sage embraces the One,\nserving as the model for all under heaven.\nNot self-displaying, therefore luminous.\nNot self-asserting, therefore illustrious.\nNot self-boasting, therefore meritorious.\nNot self-aggrandizing, therefore enduring.\nIt is only by not contending\nthat none under heaven can contend with him.\nThe saying of old, \"Bent, then whole\"—how could it be empty words?\nTruly whole, one returns to it.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nBeing bent can embody sincerity—sincere, then whole.\nWhat the sage embraces as the One, serving as the model for all under heaven, is sincerity.\nSincerely guarding what is crooked, in time it will straighten itself.\nSincerely guarding what is hollow, in time it will fill itself.\nSincerely guarding what is worn, in time it will renew itself.\nSincerely guarding what is little, in time it will attain itself.\nIf even slightly insincere, taking much as attainment—this is confusion.\nConfused, one does not attain.\nThus the sage does not self-display, therefore luminous.\nDoes not self-assert, therefore illustrious.\nDoes not self-boast, therefore meritorious.\nDoes not self-aggrandize, therefore enduring.\nOnly by guarding the preceding six\ncan the latter four avoid contending with things.\nThus none under heaven can provoke contention.\nThe saying of old, \"Bent, then whole\"—how could it be empty words?\nEmbracing my own Oneness to serve as the model for all under heaven—\nthen truly whole, one returns to it.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nSparse words are natural.\nWhirlwinds do not last the morning;\ntorrential rains do not last the day.\nWhat causes these? Heaven and earth.\nIf even heaven and earth cannot endure,\nhow much less can man?\nTherefore, those who engage with the Dao:\nthose of the Dao are one with the Dao,\nthose of virtue are one with virtue,\nthose of loss are one with loss.\nOne with the Dao, the Dao also attains them.\nOne with virtue, virtue also attains them.\nOne with loss, loss also attains them.\nWhere sincerity is insufficient, there is disbelief.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nSparse words are natural—words of non-words, actions of non-action,\nthe Dao of utmost sincerity without ceasing.\nIf one takes words as action, as intention—then sincerity is insufficient, and there is disbelief.\nSincerity ceases.\nThis chapter, following the preceding chapter’s theme of sincere wholeness, elucidates it further.\nThe attainment or loss of the Dao depends on the division between sincerity and insincerity.\nSincere, then attained; insincere, then lost.\nWhirlwinds and torrential rains harm the myriad beings,\ninevitably causing collapse—unable to last even a morning or evening,\nself-incapable of endurance—this is not the Dao of utmost sincerity.\nWhat then causes these? Heaven and earth.\nIf even heaven and earth’s whirlwinds and torrential rains cannot endure,\nhow much less can man?\nIf a state has harsh governance and oppressive decrees,\nharming the hundred clans and inevitably leading to exhaustion—\nthis too will be unable to endure.\nIs this the Dao of utmost sincerity? No.\nSincere, then one does not act with harshness or oppression.\nThus those under heaven who engage with the Dao\nfollow only what is above.\nIf above follows the Dao, below is one with the Dao.\nIf above follows virtue, below is one with virtue.\nIf above follows loss, below is one with loss.\nThus one with the Dao, the Dao also attains them.\nOne with virtue, virtue also attains them.\nOne with loss, loss also attains them.\nWhere sincerity is insufficient, there is disbelief—can one not be cautious in this?\nObserve the *Doctrine of the Mean*: \"Bent, then sincere; sincere, then formed;\nformed, then manifest; manifest, then luminous; luminous, then moving;\nmoving, then transforming; transforming, then transforming others.\"\nOnly the utmost sincerity under heaven can transform.\nFrom the bent and sincere, through six transformations, then comes transformation—\nthis is not easily altered.\nWhen the noble person occupies office, wields governance, and transforms all under heaven,\nhow can the Dao of utmost sincerity be allowed to cease?\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nOne who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm;\none who strides cannot walk.\nOne who self-displays is not luminous;\none who self-asserts is not illustrious;\none who self-boasts has no merit;\none who self-aggrandizes does not endure.\nIn the Dao, these are called\n\"leftover food and parasitic conduct.\"\nThings may detest them—\nthus those with the Dao do not dwell in them.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nOne who overreaches cannot stand firm.\nThe path of officialdom in the worldly realm—\nthough seemingly unrelated, they are never truly unrelated.\nPeople chase after fame and position,\nand with the slightest impetuous heart,\nthey fall into the realm where the Dao is unseen.\nFrom a lowly position, things are placed far away—\nthe heart desires hasty attainment,\nstraining upward in pursuit.\nNot only can things not be obtained,\nbut even one’s feet cannot stand firm.\n\n「跨者不行。 To stride too boldly is to fail in action.\n\n欲速进而大跨，未有能行者矣。\nOne who seeks swift advancement yet overreaches—\nthere has never been one who could succeed.\n\n盖由心不知道，物欲所牵，过望功名，\nThis is because the heart does not grasp the Dao,\ndragged by the cravings of things,\nexcessively coveting fame and position,\n\n曾不知分彼心，必有不容自己之惑，\nyet unaware of the limits of the heart,\nit must harbor afflictions that cannot be contained.\n\n不颠厌不已也，\nEver restless, never sated—\noh, how pitiful!\n\n故曰：自见者不明，自是者不彰，自伐者无功，自矜者不长。\nThus it is said:\nOne who self-displays is not luminous;\none who self-asserts is not illustrious;\none who self-boasts has no merit;\none who self-aggrandizes does not endure.\n\n其六者之在道也，\nThese six transgressions, in the Dao,\n譬犹残余之食，赘洗之行，\nare like leftover scraps of food and parasitic habits—\n物或恶之，故有道者不处。\nthings may detest them—\nthus those who follow the Dao do not dwell in them.\n\n《经》曰：有物混成，先天地生。\nThe *Classic* states:\nThere is a thing of

*Passing*—\n逝曰远，\n*Passing* is called *Distant*—\n远曰返。\n*Distant* is called *Returning*.\n\n故道大，天大，地大，王亦大。\nThus the Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nand the King is also Great.\n\n域中有四大，而王居其一焉。\nWithin the realm of the Great,\nthere are four Greatnesses,\nand the King holds one among them.\n\n人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然。\nHumans model themselves after Earth,\nEarth models itself after Heaven,\nHeaven models itself after the Dao,\nand the Dao models itself after *Naturalness*.\n\n《原旨》曰：有物混成，先天地生。\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThere is a thing of undifferentiated unity,\nborn before Heaven and Earth.\n\n天地之先，无物也。\nBefore Heaven and Earth,\nthere was nothing.\n\n而曰有物混成，\nYet it is said there was a thing of undifferentiated unity—\n是何物耶。\nwhat thing was this?\n\n天地之先，有五太。\nBefore Heaven and Earth,\nthere were the Five *Supremes*.\n\n列子止言太易、太初、太始、太素，\nThe *Liezi* speaks only of *Supreme Facile*,\n*Supreme Primordial*,\n*Supreme Beginning*,\nand *Supreme Substance*,\n而不言太极。\nbut does not mention *Supreme Polarity*.\n\n又言气形质具，而未相离。\nIt also says:\n*Qi* takes form and substance,\nyet they are not yet distinct.\n\n故曰浑沦。\nThus it is called *Undifferentiated*.\n\n浑沦者，言万物浑沦而未相离也，\n*Undifferentiated*—\nspeaking of all things in undifferentiated unity,\n非太极乎。\nis it not the *Supreme Polarity*?\n\n夫列子得之发明及此，\nNow, the *Liezi* expounds upon this,\n是知有物混成非物也，\nknowing that the \"thing of undifferentiated unity\"\nis not a thing at all,\n指万物相浑沦者而言也。\nbut refers to all things in their state of undifferentiated unity.\n\n吾尝曰：未有吾身，先有天地。\nI have said:\nBefore my body existed,\nHeaven and Earth already were.\n\n未有天地，先有吾心。\nBefore Heaven and Earth existed,\nmy heart already was.\n\n吾心此道也，\nMy heart is this Dao—\n岂惟吾哉。\nnot just my own.\n\n人莫不有是心，\nAll people possess this heart,\n心莫不有是道，\nand all hearts possess this Dao.\n知此谓之知道，\nTo know this is to know the Dao,\n得此谓之得道。\nto attain this is to attain the Dao.\n\n然则道何自而知，何从而得哉。\nYet how does one come to know the Dao,\nand from where does one attain it?\n\n吾将欲言，而忘其所欲言也。\nI would speak of it,\nyet I forget what I wished to say.\n\n余尝於酒扫之暇，隐几神进，\nIn my leisure moments,\nafter drinking and sweeping,\nI sit quietly and concentrate my spirit,\n适仰先天混成之道，\nto contemplate the Dao of undifferentiated unity before Heaven and Earth—\n寂寥无朕独立周行，\nsilent and vast, with no trace,\nit stands alone yet circulates universally.\n化化生生，\nIt transforms and gives birth to transformations,\n今古不忒，\nfrom ancient times to now, it is never erring.\n是宜可为天下母也。\nIt is fitting to call it the Mother of all under Heaven.\n\n老圣谦辞，谓吾不知其名，字之曰道，\nThe venerable sage humbly says,\n\"I do not know its name,\nso I call it the Dao.\"\n\n强为之名曰大。\nFor want of a better term, I name it *Great*.\n\n此一节摹写道妙若可即席而励奋语。\nThis passage vividly depicts the Dao’s subtlety,\nas though one could be inspired and roused\nwhile seated right before them.\n\n首章言无名天地之始，\nThe opening chapter speaks of the nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth,\n演至此而漏泄春风，\nand now, in unfolding this,\nit reveals the vitality of the Dao—\n有不容閟者矣。\nthere is no way to conceal it.\n\n大曰逝，\nThe Great is called *Passing*—\n逝，往也。\n*Passing* means *to go*.\n\n逝曰远，\n*Passing* is called *Distant*—\n远而无所至极也。\n*Distant* yet without any ultimate destination.\n\n远曰返，\n*Distant* is called *Returning*—\n返，复也。\n*Returning* means *to return*.\n\n复则可以见天地之心矣。\nTo return is to perceive the heart of Heaven and Earth.\n\n此道之盈虚消息，\nThis is the Dao’s waxing and waning,\n如环无端。\nlike a circle with no beginning or end.\n\n先乎天地，莫知其始。\nBefore Heaven and Earth,\nno one knows its origin.\n\n后乎天地，莫见其终。\nAfter Heaven and Earth,\nno one sees its conclusion.\n\n故以道观天地，则见道大。\nThus, when observing Heaven and Earth through the Dao,\none sees the Dao’s Greatness.\n\n以天地观帝王，则见天地大。\nWhen observing emperors through Heaven and Earth,\none sees the Greatness of Heaven and Earth.\n\n以帝王观人民，则见帝王大。\nWhen observing the people through emperors,\none sees the Greatness of emperors.\n\n虽然究其端倪，四者之大，莫不均囿大虚之域法则也。\nThough they differ in appearance,\nthe Greatness of these four—\nthe Dao, Heaven, Earth, and the King—\nall conform to the principles of the boundless void.\n\n人能仰观俯察，近取远求，\nIf humans can gaze upward and downward,\ndraw near and reach far,\n由地而知天，\nfrom Earth, they can know Heaven,\n知道，\nand from the Dao, they can know Naturalness,\n知自然，\ntaking this as their model—\n取以为法，\n内而正心诚意，\nwithin, they rectify their hearts and make their intentions sincere,\n外而修齐治平，\nwithout, they cultivate harmony and bring peace,\n以至功成身退，入圣超凡，\nuntil their deeds are accomplished and they withdraw,\nascending to sainthood and transcending the mundane,\n投身不殆，\ntheir bodies never faltering—\n是则可与此道伺久也，已噫焉。\nthen they may dwell with this Dao for long.\nAh, how noble!\n\n得知自然者，而与之言哉。\nOnly those who know *Naturalness*\ncan speak of it with them.\n\n惟知自然者，则可与言道也。\nOnly those who know *Naturalness*\ncan speak of the Dao with them.\n\n王亦大，一作人，\nThe King is also Great—\none variant reads *humans*—\n言王则人在焉。\nbut when it speaks of the King,\nit implies humans are present.\n\n今从王，\nI follow the reading of *King* here,\n尊君也。\nto honor the ruler.\n\n《经》曰：重为轻根，静为躁君。\nThe *Classic* states:\n*Weightiness* is the root of *lightness*,\nand *stillness* is the sovereign of *restlessness*.\n\n是以君子终曰行，不离辎重。\nThus the virtuous one always says,\n\"I will go,\"\nyet never leaves their *burden*—\n虽有荣观，\nthough there may be splendor and grandeur,\n燕处超然。\nthey dwell in rest with an effortless transcendence.\n\n奈何万乘之主，而以身轻天下。\nYet how can a ruler of ten thousand chariots\nmake their body *light* to the world?\n轻则失臣，\n*Lightness* leads to losing their ministers,\n躁则失君。\nand *restlessness* leads to losing their sovereignty.\n\n《原旨》曰：天下之理，重能制轻，静能制躁，\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nIn the principles of the world,\n*weightiness* can govern *lightness*,\nand *stillness* can govern *restlessness*—\n自然之道也。\nthis is the Dao of Naturalness.\n\n曰重，曰静，根本也。\n*Weightiness* and *stillness*\nare the roots and foundations—\n君主也。\nthe rulers.\n\n曰轻，曰躁，枝叶也。\n*Lightness* and *restlessness*\nare the branches and leaves—\n臣民也。\nthe ministers and people.\n\n根者重则枝叶茂，\nWhen the roots are *weighty*,\nthe branches and leaves flourish.\n君者静则臣民安，\nWhen the ruler is *still*,\nthe ministers and people are at ease.\n\n吾计其天下之必归往，\nI calculate that the world\nmust inevitably return to this—\n四海之必清平矣。\nand that the four seas will inevitably become serene and peaceful.\n\n是以君子终曰行不离辎重，\nThus the virtuous one always says,\n\"I will go,\"\nyet never leaves their *burden*—\n虽有荣观，\nthough there may be splendor and grandeur,\n燕处超然，\nthey dwell in rest with an effortless transcendence—\n君子士之知道者也。\nthis is the Dao of the virtuous scholar.\n\n惟君子而知此道，\nOnly the virtuous scholar knows this Dao,\n故行不离辎重，\nthus they go yet never leave their *burden*,\n燕处则超然，\nand dwell in rest with an effortless transcendence—\n见其行不失重，\nit is seen that their going does not lose *weightiness*,\n居不失静也。\nand their dwelling does not lose *stillness*.\n\n奈何万乘而以身轻天下，\nYet how can a ruler of ten thousand chariots\nmake their body *light* to the world?\n叹三代之昏主，\nAlas for the rulers of the Three Dynasties—\n反有不如君子之知道，\nthey even failed to match the Dao of the virtuous scholar,\n而能守重静者也。\nyet could not uphold *weightiness* and *stillness*.\n\n若桀、纣可谓身轻天下者矣。\nLike Jie and Zhou,\nthey may be called those who made their bodies *light* to the world.\n\n伊尹五就而不能用，\nYi Yin five times approached them,\nyet they could not employ him;\n微子抱祭器而归周，\nWei Zi carried the sacrificial vessels and returned to the Zhou—\n轻则失臣也。\n*lightness* leads to losing their ministers.\n\n禹、汤建久长之业，\nYu and Tang established enduring and long-lasting achievements,\n卒以其昏主暴虐而亡，\nyet ultimately perished\nbecause of their foolish rulers’ cruelty and tyranny—\n躁则失君也。\n*restlessness* leads to losing their sovereignty.\n\n有国有家者，可不戒哉。\nRulers who possess states and families—\ncan they not be warned?\n\n《经》曰：善行，无辙迹。\nThe *Classic* states:\nGood conduct leaves no tracks or traces;\n善言，无瑕谪。\ngood speech has no flaws or defects;\n善计，不用筹策。\ngood planning does not require calculations or strategies;\n善闭，无关键而不可开。」\ngood closure requires no locks or keys,\nyet cannot be opened.\n\n「Good binding, though lacking cords or knots, cannot be undone.\nThus, the Sage always excels in saving others,\nso there are none abandoned.\nAlways excels in saving things,\nso there are none discarded.\nThis is called *embracing clarity*.\n\nTherefore, the virtuous person is the teacher of the unvirtuous,\nwhile the unvirtuous serve as the resources of the virtuous.\nTo not hold one’s teacher in high regard,\nnor cherish one’s resources,\nthough seemingly great confusion—\nthis is called *the essential mystery*.\n\n*The Original Meaning* states:\nThere is the kind of goodness with *compassionate gentleness*,\nand the kind with *utter appropriateness*.\nIf one attains the goodness of *utter appropriateness*,\nthen there is nothing it does not fit,\nnothing it does not perfect.\nGood conduct, good speech, good planning, good closure, good binding—\nthose aligned with the Dao all reside in *utter appropriateness*.\nWithout tracks or traces,\nwithout flaws or defects,\nwithout calculations or strategies,\nwithout locks or keys yet unopenable,\nwithout cords or knots yet unbreakable—\nin things, this means there are no gaps for scrutiny.\n\nThus, the Sage saves people and things,\nalways through *my* goodness,\nso there is no abandonment of people or things.\nThis is called *embracing clarity*.\n*Embracing clarity* means\nacting in what is most fitting,\nyet never doing what is unfitting.\n\nTherefore, the virtuous person\ncan be the teacher of the unvirtuous.\nThe unvirtuous\ncan be the resources of the virtuous.\nTeachers originally exist to guide others with goodness.\nIf one teaches others, then one’s own heart is not held in high regard.\nThus,\nMencius said: *\"Capital is for using people well.\"*\nIf one uses people as resources,\nthen one’s own heart loses affection.\nThus, the noble one does not harm others through what sustains them,\nand so does not hold their teachers in high regard,\nnor cherish their resources.\nOne does not regard others’ teachers as noble,\nnor others’ resources as beloved.\nFrom the perspective of the world,\nthough it may seem like great confusion—\nfrom the perspective of the Dao,\nthis is called *the essential mystery*.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nKnow the *heroic* yet hold to the *receptive*,\nand you become the valley of the world.\nAs the valley of the world,\nyour virtue never departs,\nreturning to the *infant*.\nKnow the *white* yet hold to the *black*,\nand you become the model of the world.\nAs the model of the world,\nyour virtue does not overreach,\nreturning to the *Non-Extreme*.\nKnow the *honored* yet hold to the *humiliated*,\nand you become the basin of the world.\nAs the basin of the world,\nyour virtue is complete,\nreturning to the *Uncarved*.\nThe *Uncarved* disperses into things below—\nthe Sage uses it,\nand it becomes officials and leaders,\nthus great governance does not harm.\n\n*The Original Meaning* states:\nThe *infant*—the marvelous form of *my* body.\nThe *Non-Extreme*—the marvelous form of heaven, earth, and all things.\nThe *Uncarved*—the marvelous form of the Dao.\nKnowing the marvelous form of *my* body,\none holds to the *receptive* without the heart of contending for the *heroic*,\nthus able to be the valley of the world.\nAs the valley of the world—\na metaphor for the sea.\nThe sea contains all things,\nrevealing that one’s constant virtue never departs\nfrom the marvelous form of *my* body,\nreturning to the *infant*.\n\nKnowing the marvelous form of heaven, earth, and all things,\none holds to the *black* without the heart of flaunting the *white*,\nthus able to be the model of the world.\nAs the model of the world—\na metaphor for *embracing unity*.\nUnity can gather all things,\nrevealing that one’s constant virtue does not overreach\nthe marvelous form of heaven, earth, and all things,\nreturning to the *Non-Extreme*.\n\nKnowing the marvelous form of the Dao,\none holds to the *humiliated* without the heart of coveting the *honored*.\nTo hold to the *humiliated*—\nto hold to the lowly.\nThus able to be the basin of the world.\nAs the basin of the world—\na metaphor for deep, bottomless valleys.\nWhen the first *yang* stirs,\nthe root of primordial *qi* lies therein.\nThis is where one’s constant virtue is complete\nin the marvelous form of the Dao,\nreturning to the *Uncarved*.\nThe *Uncarved* disperses into things below—\nthe divine vessels of the world.\nWhen the Sage uses them,\nthey become officials and leaders,\nthus able to govern the world greatly,\nwithout causing harm or injury.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\n*\"Those who would take the world and act upon it—\nI see that they will not succeed.\nThe divine vessels of the world cannot be seized.\nTo act upon them is to ruin them;\nto grasp them is to lose them.\nThus, things sometimes move or follow,\nsometimes warm or cool,\nsometimes strong or weak,\nsometimes bear or collapse.\nTherefore, the Sage avoids excess,\navoids extravagance,\navoids extravagance.\"*\n\n*The Original Meaning* states:\nThe Sage sits in the precious position and leads the world,\nlike the great sea controlling all rivers,\nlistening as they flow toward their tributaries.\nIf one harbors the intent to take,\nthen the rivers dry up,\nand those flowing toward tributaries cease—\nthe sea’s exhaustion awaits.\nTo sit in the precious position yet harbor the intent to take the world,\nand to amass—\nis this not like the sea drying up rivers\nand cutting off their flow toward tributaries?\nI see that they will not succeed is clear.\n\nThe divine vessels of the world—\nthe precious position of emperors and kings.\nLife depends on it.\nIt cannot be achieved by cleverness,\nnor seized by force.\nTo act upon it is to ruin it;\nto grasp it is to lose it.\nThus, things sometimes move or follow,\nsometimes warm or cool,\nsometimes strong or weak,\nsometimes bear or collapse.\nThe *things* referred to—\nthe divine vessels mentioned earlier—\nare what the world relies upon,\nand cannot be treated as one’s own possessions.\n*Following* means migration.\n*Warming/cooling* means praise and blame.\n*Strong/weak* means prosperity and decline.\n*Bearing/collapsing* means safety and peril.\nThe *sometimes* reflects\nthat the Way has no constancy,\nand the people are to be feared.\nThus, the Sage knows\nthat safety must have peril,\nand avoids excess.\nKnows that prosperity must have decline,\nand avoids extravagance.\nKnows that praise must have blame,\nand avoids extravagance.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\n*\"Those who assist rulers with the Dao\ndo not use force to dominate the world.\nTheir affairs return naturally—\nwhere the army passes, thorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great armies, there are years of famine.\nThus, the virtuous achieve only what is fitting,\ndaring not to take by force.\"*\n\n「Thus, the fruits of action must be reaped without arrogance,\nwithout boasting,\nwithout pride,\nand only when unavoidable—\nthis is the way of reaping fruits without force.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they grow old—\nthis is called *not* the Dao.\nNot the Dao means early ruin.\n\n*The Original Meaning* states:\nChapter A: When rulers possess the world,\nit is because they have the land.\nWith the land, there are ancestral altars.\nWith ancestral altars, there are the people.\nThe ancestral altars and the people—\nthese are the sacred tools of the world.\nThe previous chapter admonished rulers with the Dao,\nthis chapter warns ministers against using arms.\nAh! The wisdom of the ancient Sage is profound indeed.\nEven to not aspire to the world—\nthis is why he stands as a teacher for a hundred generations.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven favors life and abhors killing,\nfilling the abundant and nourishing the modest,\nvaluing gentleness and not favoring harshness.\nGentleness brings life,\nharshness brings death—\nthis is the inevitable course of nature.\n\nThus, the virtuous act only when unavoidable.\nWhen the people of the world are led by the Dao,\nthe ministers should assist the ruler,\nprotect the ancestral altars,\nand ensure the people’s safety.\nIf they instead use arms to dominate the world,\nthey overturn the ancestral altars,\npoison the people—\nthis is even worse.\nMoreover, arms have no constant victor,\ntheir consequences return naturally,\nand defeat follows swiftly—\nhow can one not be warned?\n\nIf ministers cannot assist their ruler with the Dao,\nbut instead indulge in reckless warfare,\nboast of martial prowess,\nand scheme for glory within the state,\nthen they waste their people through battle.\nThe people cannot endure,\nand if they do not die in war,\nthey flee and abandon the land.\nThe calamities of arms are such across the world.\nWhere the army marches,\nplowing and weeding cease,\nand thorns and brambles grow.\nA hundred *li* of war brings harm to a hundred *li*.\nA thousand *li* of war brings harm to a thousand *li*.\nAfter great armies are raised,\nwithout waiting for floods or droughts,\nthe years become calamitous.\nIs this the Dao of a virtuous minister?\n\nThe virtuous achieve only what is fitting,\ndaring not to take by force—\nthus, they should carefully examine what they take.\n\nObserve Confucius, when answering Duke Ling’s inquiry about warfare at a sacrificial feast,\nand you will know that arms are not to be spoken of lightly.\nWhen answering Zigong’s question about governance,\nyou will know that arms can be abandoned.\nAlas! The Sage Confucius’ concern for the world—\nhow is it different from the ancient Sage’s?\n\nTo reap fruits without arrogance,\nwithout boasting,\nwithout pride,\nand only when unavoidable—\nthis means that when natural reason dictates,\nas in what I have spoken,\none must know that it is unavoidable\nand proceed accordingly—\nonly then does one embody the Dao of reaping without force.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they grow old—\nif ministers, at the height of their power,\ndo not know when to retreat,\nbut instead engage in military posturing and political games,\nthen danger is near.\nThis is called *not* knowing the Dao,\nand not the Dao means early ruin—\nhow much more so when bows are stored and dogs are slaughtered,\nonly hastening their own downfall!\n\nHow then can they hope to assist the ruler,\nbring order to the state,\nand achieve peace in the world?\nThose who hear this should take heed.\n\n*The Classic* states:\n*\"Fine arms are ominous instruments,\nwhich things often detest,\nso those who follow the Dao do not wield them.\nThe virtuous should honor the left in peace,\nbut honor the right in war.\nArms are ominous instruments,\nnot the tools of the virtuous,\nused only when unavoidable.\nSerenity and simplicity are supreme.\nVictory should not be gloried in—\nto glory in it is to delight in killing.\nThose who delight in killing cannot aspire to rule the world.\nAuspicious matters favor the left,\nominous matters favor the right.\nThe lesser general is placed on the left,\nthe supreme general on the right—\nthis is to liken them to funeral rites.\nWhen many are killed,\nthey should be mourned with sorrowful tears.\nVictory should be treated as funeral rites.\"*\n\n*The Original Meaning* says:\n*\"Bows and arrows have long threatened the world,\nand yet the world has always had those who steal them\nto defy the Son of Heaven—\nthis has been so since ancient times.\nHow can arms not be treated with caution?\nArms are instruments of killing.\nYet they are called 'fine arms'—\nthere must be those who delight in killing.\nOminous instruments are instruments of harm.\nEarlier, they were called sacred tools,\nnow they are called instruments of harm—\nsometimes revered as sacred,\nsometimes reviled as ominous—\nhow can one possess the world\nwhile allowing such conflicting hearts to arise?\nThus, those who follow the Dao do not wield them.\nThis follows the remaining meaning of the previous chapter,\nwarning ministers who love to use arms.*\n\nWhen the world is at peace,\nthe virtuous in office should value the left.\nBut when war arises,\nthey should value the right.\nArms are ominous instruments,\nnot the tools of the virtuous,\nused only when unavoidable.\nThey should always uphold serenity and simplicity as supreme.\n\nSerenity and simplicity—\nthe ruler’s teacher seeks to nurture the people,\nnot to revel in captives and deceit,\nnor to harbor treacherous intentions.\nThus, though they may win,\nthey do not take pride in it.\nIf they do take pride,\nit is because they delight in killing.\nThose who delight in killing cannot aspire to rule the world.\n\nLike the Duke of Chu’s Ziyou at Chengpu,\nor Jin’s Xianguo at Ji,\nall those who wield arms and love war\nultimately cannot achieve their ambitions.\n\nMencius told King Xiang of Liang:\n*\"Those who do not delight in killing can unite the world.\nAgain he said:\nThe world has no one who does not seek harmony,\nhow can one who delights in killing\naspire to rule the world?\"*\n\nThe left is the honored position,\nthe right is the lowly position.\nAuspicious matters favor the left—\nthis is joyful.\nOminous matters favor the right—\nthis is sorrowful.\nThe lesser general is placed on the left,\nfor he does not bear sole responsibility for killing,\nand thus is given an honored position.\nThe supreme general is placed on the right,\nfor he holds the power of life and death,\nand thus is given a lowly position.\nThis clearly shows that ominous matters should not be honored.\n\nAlas! When receiving orders from the general,\nthe general commands the army,\nand the ruler’s orders may not always be obeyed.\nAt such times, how should the ruler’s heart be?\nIt is perilous.\nThus, the lesser general is placed on the left,\nto show the need for caution,\nwhile the supreme general is placed on the right,\nto bear the ominous name of war.»\n\nThe **Dao** is ever nameless.\nThe **uncarved block**—though small—\nthe world dare not enslave.\nIf lords and kings could guard it well,\nall things would come as guests.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends.\nNo command from Heaven,\nyet all is balanced.\nAt first, the **Dao** was nameless,\nbut when names were given,\nHeaven knew to halt.\nTo know when to stop\nis how one avoids ruin.\n\nLike the **Dao** in the world,\nit is akin to streams and valleys\nwith the great rivers and seas.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\nThe **Dao** is ever nameless—\nnameless, hence honored.\nThe **uncarved block** has no form—\nno form, hence vast.\nOnly by not dwelling in what is honored and vast\ndoes it remain small yet unassailable by the world.\nIf lords and kings could embody\nthis nameless honor and formless greatness,\nguard it without loss,\nthey would not need to proclaim their virtue to all under Heaven—\nyet the multitude of people and things\nwould naturally submit.\n\nFor lords and kings to the people,\nas Heaven and Earth to all things,\nthis response and that reaction\nare governed by one principle.\n\nObserve Heaven and Earth’s weaving and binding,\nthe union of yin and yang,\nand sweet dew descends—\nnothing but the **harmony of balance** at work.\n\nThat which is balanced without command\nshows how all things first divided,\ntheir **spirit-essence and vital qi** allotted,\ntheir beginnings and growth\nrequiring not a hair’s breadth of human effort.\n\nFrom the **Dao**’s nameless origin\nto the giving of names,\neach thing follows its own principle.\nOnce names are given,\nwhen deeds are done and matters settled,\nHeaven knows to halt—\nthe **Dao** of withdrawal.\n\nThe ancients who grasped this\nwere exalted as emperors or kings.\nThose who do not know the **Dao**,\nthe **Way** is long past—\nhow much more so\nwhen bows are stored and dogs are boiled,\nonly hastening their own downfall?\n\nHow then could they hope\nto aid the sovereign’s rule,\ngovern the state in order,\nand bring peace to the world?\nHearers of this should take warning.\n\nThe *Scripture* says:\n**\"Excellent weapons are not auspicious instruments**—\nthings may detest them,\nso those who follow the **Dao** do not dwell upon them.\nThe gentleman in peace values the left,\nin war values the right.\n\nWeapons are not auspicious instruments,\nnot the tools of the gentleman,\nused only when there is no other choice.\nCalm and unassuming is the highest virtue,\nto conquer yet not take pleasure in it.\n\nBut those who take pleasure in it\ndelight in killing people.\nThose who delight in killing people\ncannot hope to prevail in the world.\n\nAuspicious matters favor the left—\nthis is joyful.\nOminous matters favor the right—\nthis is sorrowful.\nThe lesser general is placed on the left,\nfor he does not bear sole responsibility for killing,\nand thus is given an honored position.\nThe supreme general is placed on the right,\nfor he holds the power of life and death,\nand thus is given a lowly position.\nThis clearly shows that ominous matters should not be honored.\n\nAlas!

seas.\n\n*The Original Meaning* says:\nThe **Dao** is ever nameless—\nnameless, hence revered.\nThe **uncarved block** has no form—\nno form, hence vast.\nThough it does not dwell in reverence or vastness,\nit is small yet none dare enslave it.\nIf lords and kings could embody this nameless reverence,\nthis formless vastness,\nand guard it without loss,\nthey would not need to proclaim their virtue to all under heaven—\nyet the multitude of people and things would submit as guests.\n\nFor lords and kings to the people,\nas Heaven and Earth to all things,\nthis response and that reaction—\nthey share the same principle.\nObserve how Heaven and Earth, in their interplay,\nwith yin and yang united,\ndescend sweet dew—\nall arising from the **harmony of balance**.\nNone commands it, yet all is equal.\nAt first, the **Dao** was nameless,\nbut when names were given,\none thing, one principle—\nnames given, deeds accomplished,\nHeaven knows when to halt—\nthe **Way of withdrawal**.\n\nThe ancients who grasped this\nwere **Emperors above** and **Kings below**—\nFuxi and King Wen.\nFuxi attained it as **Emperor**,\ndrawing the six primordial strokes,\nwith **Heaven** to the south and **Earth** to the north,\nfixing their positions,\nand first giving names—\nthus the **Emperor’s Way** flourished.\nWhen King Wen attained it as **King**,\nthe **Dao** was fully realized—\nnames had been given.\nHe then composed the eight trigrams of **Later Heaven**,\nwith **Heaven** withdrawing to the northwest,\n**Earth** to the southwest—\nHeaven knew when to halt.\nTo know when to halt\nis how one avoids ruin.\nWithdrawing at the right time—\nwhat danger could there be?\nThe **Emperor-King’s** spirit is thus revealed.\n\nThe Sage gathers the essence of Heaven and Earth,\nclarifying the **uncarved block**,\nand for those who would be lords and kings,\nexplains it in parables and mysteries—\nthe principles are now fully laid out.\nYet fearing later ages might not grasp its meaning,\nhe speaks again in closer terms:\n*\"The **Dao** in the world is like rivers and valleys to the seas.\"*\n\nThis elucidates what was seen earlier:\n*\"The heroic, about to take the world.\"*\n\n*The Scripture* says:\nHe who knows others is wise,\nhe who knows himself is enlightened.\nHe who overcomes others has strength,\nhe who overcomes himself is powerful.\nHe who knows contentment is rich,\nhe who perseveres has resolve.\nHe who does not lose his place endures,\nhe who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\n\n*The Original Meaning* says:\nLife and death are great matters indeed.\nExamined closely,\nwhen one is manifest, they are human;\nwhen hidden, they are spirits and gods.\nManifest, they return to humanity—\nno ancient or modern, no wise or foolish—\nall the same.\nYet in life,\nprosperity and adversity, gain and loss,\ncycle like clouds—\nemotions shift with circumstances,\nas one bows and rises through an age,\nlike the Creator’s alternating dark and bright,\nexpanding and contracting—\never-changing, a myriad forms in a day.\nWithout the **Dao** to guide them,\nwho would not stumble and fall?\n\nThus one must first know self and others,\nthen can fully respond to the world and engage with things—\nthe **Way of humanity**,\nthe **Way of knowing life and death**.\n\nHe who knows others is wise,\nhe who knows himself is enlightened.\nBy \"know,\" I do not mean knowing their clans or kin,\ntheir achievements or deeds—\nonly their hearts.\nTo know another’s heart,\nwhat task could not be accomplished with wisdom?\nTo know one’s own heart,\nwhat action could not be measured with clarity?\n\nHe who overcomes others has strength—\nfor desire burns fiercely in them.\nHe who overcomes himself is powerful—\nfor Heaven’s principle is clear.\nHe who knows contentment is rich—\nfor his inner substance is full.\nHe who perseveres has resolve—\nfor his body is strong and healthy.\nHe who does not lose his place endures—\nfor he abides in the **Middle Way**.\nHe who dies yet does not perish is long-lived—\nfor his essence returns whole.\n\nMortals, in their rise and fall,\ntheir lifespan fixed by transformation,\ndo not merely possess enduring virtue or great deeds\nto prolong this age—\nbut those who are manifest as human,\nhidden as spirits and gods,\nseem to vanish yet endure,\nunseen yet divine—\ntruly, the unperishing exists.\n\n*The Scripture* says:\nThe **Great Dao** flows—\nit can be neither grasped nor resisted.\nAll things rely on it to live,\nyet it does not claim credit.\nIt accomplishes without naming itself.\nIt nurtures all things yet does not rule—\never without desire,\nit may be called **small**.\nAll things return to it yet it does not rule—\nit may be called **great**.\nThus the Sage never claims greatness,\nand so achieves true greatness.\n\n*The Original Meaning* says:\nThe Sage nurtures the people,\nnot boasting of achievements or virtue—\nfor he embodies the **Dao**.\nThough the world bears him up without burden,\nand he delights in spreading virtue without restraint,\nthough he does not desire greatness,\nit is inevitable.\nThe **Great Dao** flows—\nomnipresent, neither left nor right.\nWherever it goes,\nall things rely on it to live,\nyet it does not refuse.\nThings live because of it—\nno refusal, no gratitude.\nIt accomplishes without claiming credit—\nwhat deeds remain to claim?\nIt nurtures all things yet does not rule—\nwhat it should nurture, it nurtures—\nhow could it claim mastery?\nEver without desire,\nit may be called **small**—\nthe ultimate in humility.\nAll things return to it yet it does not rule—\nit may be called **great**.\nWith no intention to receive,\nthings come of their own accord.\nWith no intention to be great,\nthings grow great of their own accord.\nSuch is the **Dao** in its essence.\nThus the Sage takes the **Dao** as his heart,\nnurtures all the people,\nthough his deeds and virtues are great,\nhe never considers himself great—\nand so the world submits,\nand he achieves true greatness.\n\nI conclude this chapter,\nleaning back, savoring in silence,\nwandering in spirit to antiquity,\nand there I see the **Emperor of Primordial Times**,\nhis followers like wild deer,\nthe **Great Uncarved** in its pure simplicity—\nstill vibrant, as if alive.\n\n*The Scripture* says:\nHold fast to the **Great Symbol**—\nthe world will come.\nCome without harm,\nsecure and at peace.\nJoy and bait—\npassengers will stop.\nWhen the **Dao** leaves the mouth,\nit is bland, without taste.\nTo look at it, insufficient to see;\nto listen, insufficient to hear;\nto use it, inexhaustible.\n\n*The Original Essence* says:\nThe **Dao** is vast without bounds—\nthe Sage follows its pattern and embodies it,\nto nurture all under Heaven.\n\nThe **Four Quarters** and **Eight Barbarians**,\nall are embraced with love and nourished,\ntheir needs met without measure—\nthus the world comes to him.\n\nWhen they come, they are unharmed,\nsettled in peace,\npeace brings tranquility,\ntranquility brings harmony.\n\nThe ancients who practiced this—\n**Yellow Emperor** was one.\nObserving the **Dao** of Heaven,\nholding fast to its ways,\nhe ruled with ease while all under Heaven was ordered.\n\nYet what is this \"order\"?\nJoy and bait—\npassengers stop when they arrive.\nWeapons against rebels\nare like joy and bait for travelers:\nwhen guests come, spread music and food to entertain them,\nand they will stay—\nthen depart.\n\nWhen **Chiyou**’s chaos arose, it must be punished—\nweapons were raised.\nWhen **Yandi** returned, he was pardoned—\nweapons could then be laid down.\n\nWeapons cannot always be wielded,\nnor can they always be governed by ritual.\nDrinking wine begins with order,\nbut ends in disorder.\n\nWhen harmony reaches its peak,\nstrange delights arise—\nso too with all things:\nbeginning with sincerity,\nending in vulgarity.\nAt first, it is simple,\nbut when complete,\nit becomes excessive.\nThus, weapons—\nhow can one not be wary?\n\nThe **Dao** as speech,\nwhen spoken, is bland without taste—\nnot like joy and bait,\nbut like the **Great Symbol**.\n\nThe **Symbol** has no form,\nso it cannot be seen.\nThe **Symbol** has no sound,\nso it cannot be heard.\nThe Sage follows and applies it—\nits use is boundless.\n\n*The Scripture* says:\nTo seek to nourish,\nfirst stretch it taut.\nTo seek to weaken,\nfirst strengthen it.\nTo seek to abandon,\nfirst establish it.\nTo seek to take,\nfirst give it—\nthis is called **subtle clarity**.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard.\nFish cannot escape the deep—\na state’s sharp tools\nshould not be displayed to the people.\n\n*The Original Essence* says:\nDay and night alternate in brightness and obscurity,\npeople and things wax and wane—\nthe unceasing flow of antiquity and present,\nfor **Great Transformation** moves through the cosmos.\nSome things cannot escape:\nspring brings warmth, winter brings cold,\nautumn brings coolness, summer brings heat—\ntheir cycles shift without end,\nthe natural order.\n\nWhat intent does **Transformation** have?\nThus cold and heat succeed each other,\nand the year’s work is complete.\nTo seek to nourish,\nfirst stretch it taut—\nthis is **opening and closing**.\nTo seek to weaken,\nfirst strengthen it—\nthis is **subtraction and addition**.\nTo seek to abandon,\nfirst establish it—\nthis is **negation and affirmation**.\nTo seek to take,\nfirst give it—\nthis is **life and death**.\nThis is the **subtle yet clear** work of **Great Transformation**.\n\nThus the soft overcomes the hard.\nSoftness is the nature of **qi**.\nThings change and flow.\nHardness is the nature of form.\nThings grow strong and then decay.\nTo know change and flow,\nwithout falling into rigidity or decay—\nthen victory lies within our grasp.\n\nFish cannot escape the deep.\nFish are the people,\nthe deep is the state,\nwater is the sharp tools.\nSharp tools are wealth and food.\nWhen the deep holds water, fish are secure;\nwhen the state has wealth and food, the people are secure.\nWater hidden in the deep—\nfish do not flee.\nWealth and food hidden in the world—\nthe people do not flee.\n\nFor a ruler governing a state,\ncan he display the means of accumulation to the people?\nKnowing the flow of **Great Transformation**,\nthe ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness,\nthe fixed principles of nature—\nthen the mind of reckoning\nwill naturally have no need for excess.\nHow much more so when the state’s resources\nare stored throughout the world,\nlike water drying in winter and filling in spring—\nnever lacking—\nwhat need for worry?\n\n*The Scripture* says:\nThe **Dao** acts without action,\nyet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nall things would transform of their own accord.\nIf transformation begins to stir,\nI will steady it with the **Unnamed Primordial**.\n\nThe **Unnamed Primordial** will also not desire—\nnot desiring, it remains still,\nand the world will align itself.\n\n*The Original Essence* says:\nThe **Dao** acts without action,\nyet nothing remains undone.\nThe **Dao** has fixed principles:\nwhat should be done and what should not.\nNot doing what should not be done,\ndoing what should be done—\nthen spring will be spring,\nsummer will be summer,\nyin and yang will not err,\nwithout words, the four seasons proceed.\nIf things and their **Dao** reverse their nature,\ndisastrous **qi** arises,\nthe seasons lose harmony,\nand things are harmed.\n\nSo too with governance.\nIf lords and kings embody the **Dao** of governance,\nupholding what the ruler should do,\nnot doing what the ruler should not—\nthen rulers will be rulers,\nministers will be ministers,\ntheir roles without error.\nThe ruler need not speak,\nand all officials will be correct.\nAll things will transform of their own accord.\n\nThe altars and people—\nnone will dare overstep their place,\ndoing what they should,\nnot doing what they should not.\n\nIf imperial virtue falters,\nalternative policies arise.\nIf the ruler fully embodies the **Dao** of rule,\nand ministers fully embody the **Dao** of service,\nsuperiors do not oppress inferiors,\ninferiors do not overstep superiors—\nhow could anyone dare defy their will\nand not conform to the **Dao**?\n\nIf transformation begins to stir,\nit means that after transformation,\nthere is still another desire to act.\nThe ruler’s path must consider:\n*Why does this desire to act arise?*\nThere must be those who provoke it.\nDo not wait for them to act first—\nexamine what I have not yet done correctly,\nreturn to what is correct,\nand steady it with stillness.\n\nThus, their intentions will naturally dissipate,\ntheir crimes exposed without need for words,\nand they will transform of their own accord.\nHow dare they act again?\n\nThis is called:\n*I will steady it with the **Unnamed Primordial**.*\nThe **Unnamed Primordial** will also not desire—\nthe ruler, ashamed of his virtue,\nthe people, fearful of his might—\nhe must also forget speech,\nserene as if unaware—\nthis is called *not desiring*.\nNot desiring, he remains still,\nand the world will align itself.\n\nThe **Dao**’s action without action,\nyet nothing remains undone.\n\nIf people of this age\nwere as inert as logs or stones,\nonly then could they be called \"without action\"—\nhow then could anything be done?\n\n「This is not what I know.\n\nFrom the original meaning of *Dao De Xuan Jing* (卷之二竟), and the original meaning of *Dao De Xuan Jing* (卷之三):\n\nThe Master of the Teachings, **Du Daojian** of Cangtu, annotates:\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nThe **virtue** of the **Way**’s highest does not cling to virtue—\nthus, it has **virtue**.\n\nThe **virtue** of the **Way**’s lowest does not abandon virtue—\nthus, it lacks **virtue**.\n\nThe **Way**’s highest acts without action—\nyet nothing is left undone.\n\nThe **Way**’s lowest acts for action—\nyet it has much to do.\n\nThe **Way**’s highest **ren** acts with intention—\nyet nothing is left undone.\n\nThe **Way**’s highest **yi** acts with intention—\nyet it has much to do.\n\nThe **Way**’s highest **li** acts with intention—\nyet none respond in kind,\nso it forces arms and persists.\n\nThus, one loses the **Way** and then finds **virtue**,\nloses **virtue** and then finds **ren**,\nloses **ren** and then finds **yi**,\nloses **yi** and then finds **li**.\n\nFor **li** is but the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nyet the root of chaos.\n\nPreconceived knowledge is but the superficial bloom of the **Way**,\nyet the beginning of folly.\n\nTherefore, the **great man** abides in its depth,\nnot dwelling in its shallowness.\n\nHe holds to its substance,\nnot lingering on its ornamentation.\n\nThus, he abandons that and takes this.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\nThe **Way** is to tread.\n**Virtue** is to attain.\nTo tread the **Way** and attain **virtue**—\nthis is called the **Way**’s highest **virtue**.\n\nThe heart of the **Way**’s highest **virtue** does not exalt itself in **virtue**,\nso the hearts of people naturally turn to it—\nthus, it has **virtue**, and its **virtue** is vast.\n\nThe heart of the **Way**’s lowest **virtue** does not forget itself in **virtue**,\nso the hearts of people may not necessarily turn to it—\nthus, it lacks **virtue**, and its **virtue** is small.\n\nThe **Way**’s highest **virtue** has no intention of acting,\nno means to act—\nthis is the **Way**’s secondary aspect.\n\nThe **Way**’s lowest **virtue** has intention of acting,\nmeans to act—\nthus, its **virtue** is low.\n\nThe **Way**’s highest **ren** has intention of acting,\nyet no means to act—\nthis is **virtue**’s secondary aspect.\n\nThe **Way**’s highest **yi** has intention of acting,\nyet it has means to act—\nthis is **ren**’s secondary aspect.\n\nThe **Way**’s highest **li** has intention of acting,\nyet none respond in kind—\nthis is **yi**’s secondary aspect.\n\nIf none respond with strength,\nthen the heart of the unworthy arises,\nand when the heart of the unworthy arises,\nit forces arms and persists—\nthis is not strange.\n\nThus, one loses the **Way** and then finds **virtue**,\nloses **virtue** and then finds **ren**,\nloses **ren** and then finds **yi**,\nloses **yi** and then finds **li**.\n\nFor **li** is but the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nyet the root of chaos.\nChaos brings forth much forcing of arms.\n\nPreconceived knowledge is but the **Way**’s superficial bloom,\nthe **Way**’s lack of substance now revealed,\nfolly’s beginning.\nThe shallow customs are already evident—\nthus, the **great man** abides in the **Way**’s depth and substance,\nnot dwelling in the **li**’s superficiality.\n\nHence, it is said: *abandon that and take this.*\n\nAlas! The **Way** descends to become the **virtue** of the Emperor,\nthe Emperor’s **virtue** descends to become the **ren** and **yi** of the King,\nthe King’s **ren** and **yi** descend to become the **yi** and **strategy** of the **Duke**,\nthe **Duke**’s **strategy** descends to become the deceit and chaos of the Warring States,\nforcing arms and persisting—\nthe people cannot endure it.\n\nThus, the **Way** of the **Way**’s highest and the **Way**’s lowest is revealed,\nand the division of **virtue** and **desire** is established.\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* are composed,\nand the distinctions of names are defined—\nthough the words differ, their meaning is one.\n\nThe **great man** with aspirations for his age,\naiming to enlighten the ruler and benefit the people,\nneed not be bound by office or seclusion—\nhe refines his words and establishes sincerity,\nfor the **Way** is within them.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nThose of old who attained **Oneness**—\nthe heavens attained **Oneness**, thus it was clear.\nThe earth attained **Oneness**, thus it was tranquil.\nThe **spirit** attained **Oneness**, thus it was responsive.\nThe **valleys** attained **Oneness**, thus they were full.\nAll things attained **Oneness**, thus they were born.\nThe lords and kings attained **Oneness**, thus they became the **acme** of the world.\n\nIf they overreach in attaining it—\nthe heavens, lacking clarity, would fear to split.\nThe earth, lacking tranquility, would fear to erupt.\nThe **spirit**, lacking responsiveness, would fear to stagnate.\nThe **valleys**, lacking fullness, would fear to dry.\nAll things, lacking birth, would fear to perish.\nThe lords and kings, lacking nobility, would fear to fall.\n\nThus, nobility is rooted in humility,\nand height is founded on lowliness—\nhence, lords and kings call themselves *lonely*, *few*, and *unfilled*—\nthis is their rooting in humility,\nis it not?\n\nThus, they overreach in attaining **Oneness**,\nyet have no **Oneness**—\nthey do not desire brilliance like jade,\nnor aloofness like stone.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\nThe **Way**’s presence among heaven, earth, **spirit**, things, and rulers of the people—\nnone lack their portion,\nyet one can only diminish, not increase it.\nThus, the heavens diminish in the west and north,\nthe earth lacks in the east and south—\nonly by their diminishing and lacking,\nand not by self-satisfaction,\ncan they endure long.\n\nThe Sage has no absolute power,\nand the **Way** is the same.\nOnly by having no absolute power,\ncan one be called Sage.\n\nIf one understands this **Way** as a lord or king,\none must not fail to practice humility and self-lowering—\nhow much more so for subjects and commoners,\nwho do not know of humility and self-lowering!\n\nObserving from the greatest aspect,\none should not cling to what should not be—\nmany such cases exist.\nObserving from the smallest aspect,\none should not abandon what should be—\nmany such cases exist.\n\nSince neither should be abandoned nor should be clung to,\nmany things can be diminished, yet not all—\nthe **Way** also has its portions.\n\nThose of old who attained **Oneness**—\nlike heaven, earth, **spirit**, **valleys**, all things, and lords and kings—\nnone failed to attain their portion,\nthus they could be clear, tranquil, responsive, full, born,\nand become the **acme** of the world.\nThis is attaining to the extreme.\n\nIf they overreach to the extreme—\nthe heavens, lacking clarity, would fear to split.\nThe earth, lacking tranquility, would fear to erupt.\nThe **spirit**, lacking responsiveness, would fear to stagnate.\nThe **valleys**, lacking fullness, would fear to dry.\nAll things, lacking birth, would fear to perish.\nThe lords and kings, lacking nobility, would fear to fall.\n\nIf one lacks portions and yet seeks to contain them all,\nhow can it endure?\n\nThus, nobility is rooted in humility,\nand height is founded on lowliness.\nKnowing the danger of overreaching,\none must not forget humility and lowliness when in high and noble positions—\nthe foundation is thus secure.\n\nHence, lords and kings call themselves *lonely*, *few*, and *unfilled*—\nspeaking of their **virtue** being lonely and few,\nwords of self-humility.\nThis is their rooting in humility,\nis it not?\n\nReflecting on their own words,\nand yet sighing in lamentation,\nthus they overreach in attaining **Oneness**,\nyet have no **Oneness**—\nspeaking of **virtue**’s noble self-concealment.\nIf **virtue**’s noble self-concealment is within what I attain,\nthen those who have the heart to reveal and flaunt\nwill be few indeed.»\n\nThe Wheel, as an object, inherently possesses a complete form—\nit cannot be said to have many spokes, yokes, hubs, or axles,\nyet if one seeks to make it a Wheel by counting and demanding these parts,\nthen the Wheel is lost.\n\nThus, the Way of lords and kings does not desire\nto be polished like jade (*琭琭*),\nbut rather to multiply their **virtue**.\nNor does it wish to be rugged like a *·* stone (*落落*),\nbut to diminish themselves through **virtue**.\n\nNeither multiplying nor diminishing,\nthen the former attainment of **Oneness** naturally aligns with the proper distribution of parts.\nWhen the proper distribution of parts is attained,\nhow can it not endure?\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Reversal is the movement of the Dao,\nand weakness is its operation.*\nAll things under heaven are born of **Being**,\nand **Being** is born of **Non-Being**.\"\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*\"Reversal is the movement of the Dao,\nand weakness is its operation.*\nThe upper sentence speaks of **substance**,\nthe lower of **operation**.\nThe substance of the Dao is **operation** itself.\nThus, reversal and return are one—\nreturning to what reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Dao has no fixed substance,\nonly change is its substance.\nWhen it moves, **Transformation** and **Manifestation** flow,\nand all things are born.\nWeakness is softness.\nThe soft and weak are the companions of life.\nThe Dao has no fixed operation,\nonly **Manifestation** is its operation.\nWhen it operates, the intention of life unfolds and applies itself,\nand all things find tranquility.\n\nAh! All things under heaven are born of **Being**,\nand **Being** is born of **Non-Being**—\n**Being** and **Non-Being**—\nwhat are they truly?\n\n**Void** transforms into **Spirit**,\n**Spirit** transforms into **Qi**,\n**Qi** transforms into **Form**—\nall that possess **Form** and **Qi** are things.\nThings must decay,\nand when they decay, they return to **Non-Being**.\nIf there is **Oneness** that does not decay,\nwhat remains is it?\n\nObserving that **Qi** brings forth things,\none knows that **Spirit** generates **Qi**,\nand **Spirit** is born of the Dao.\n**Spirit** is nature,\n**Qi** is fate—\ntogether, they are called the Dao.\nThe Sage establishes teaching,\nso that people may cultivate the Dao,\neach rectifying their nature and fate—\nthis is rooted in this principle.\n\nZhongni exhausts nature to reach fate,\nspeaking of reversal to its end.\nZisii says fate is nature,\nspeaking of the origin of the beginning.\nThe Master Lao speaks of returning to fate but not of nature—\nthis is the saying that **Being** is born of **Non-Being**,\nfor nature is already present.\n\nI have often discussed nature—\nwhat I inherently possess—\nand fate—\nwhat Heaven bestows at the beginning of life.\nNature without fate,\nI have no means to live.\nFate without nature,\nHeaven has no means to bestow.\nNature and fate mutually nourish each other,\nand only then is the Dao of life fully realized.\nAt the end of life,\nwhen form perishes and fate returns,\nonly nature does not perish—\nit endures with the Dao through long cultivation.\nThis is called cultivating the Dao.\nAttaining this is called attaining the Dao.\n\nThose who study the Dao may fail to examine their own original nature,\nyet ask of others about fate—\nthis is not understanding the proper relationship between nature and fate.\nI have obtained this principle and will expound it further.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The superior man hears the Dao and diligently practices it.\nThe middle man hears the Dao and holds it uncertainly, as if it exists or does not.\nThe inferior man hears the Dao and laughs greatly at it.\nIf one does not laugh, it is not sufficient to be called the Dao.\nThus, the Sage’s speech is established as **Being**,\nyet the Dao is as if in darkness.\nAdvancing the Dao is like retreating,\nleveling the Dao is like obstructing it.\nThe highest **virtue** is like a valley,\nthe greatest brightness is like a stain,\nthe broadest **virtue** is like insufficiency,\nthe established **virtue** is like theft,\nthe genuine simplicity is like perversity.\nThe greatest square has no corners,\nthe greatest vessel is slow to form,\nthe greatest sound is rare in tone,\nthe greatest image is formless.\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless.\nOnly the Dao is good at lending itself and yet completing its task.\"*\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*\"The Dao has sentiment and trustworthiness,\nno action and no form—\nit can be transmitted but not received,\nit can be attained yet not seen.\nThe superior man hears the Dao and comprehends its sentiment and trustworthiness,\nand also grasps its actionless and formless nature—\nthus, he diligently practices it.\nThe middle man hears the Dao and, though he comprehends its sentiment and trustworthiness,\nhas yet to grasp its actionless and formless nature—\nthus, he holds it uncertainly, as if it exists or does not.\nThe inferior man hears the Dao and is perplexed by both aspects—\nthus, he laughs greatly at it.\nIndeed, the inferior man’s innate endowment is shallow,\nand he is further drowned by human desires—\nHeaven’s principles are not yet clear,\nand the things of the world that have form and action,\nhe has yet to attain—\nhow much less could he grasp the Dao’s actionless and formless nature?\nThus, the inferior man cannot help but laugh.\nIf he does not laugh, it is not sufficient to reveal the greatness of my Dao.\n\nEstablished speech, anciently spoken,\nthe Dao is as if in darkness,\nadvancing the Dao is like retreating,\nleveling the Dao is like obstructing it,\nthe highest **virtue** is like a valley,\nthe greatest brightness is like a stain,\nthe broadest **virtue** is like insufficiency,\nthe established **virtue** is like theft,\nthe genuine simplicity is like perversity.\nThese eight aspects speak of the Dao’s **operation**—\n**Being** as if **Non-Being**.\n\nThe greatest square has no corners,\nthe square has no corners, thus it is greatest.\nThe greatest vessel is slow to form,\nthe vessel is slow to form, thus it is greatest.\nThe greatest sound is rare in tone,\nthe sound is rare in tone, thus it is greatest.\nThe greatest image is formless,\nthe image is formless, thus it is greatest.\nThese four aspects speak of the Dao’s **substance**—\n**reality** as if **void**.\n\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless,\nknown yet unsaid,\ncapable yet unacted upon.\nOnly the Dao is good at lending itself and yet completing its task.\nOnly because it is good at lending itself,\nit can be transmitted.\nOnly because it is yet completing its task,\nit can be attained.\nThus, the unattainable and unseen aspects of the Dao—\nthe Dao is not an external thing,\nso it cannot be grasped by the hand or seen by the eye.\nOnly in hearing the Dao and diligently practicing it,\nseeking its presence within oneself,\nwill one naturally attain it without waiting for reception or prolonged seeking.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The Dao gives birth to **Oneness**,\n**Oneness** gives birth to the **Two**,\nthe **Two** gives birth to the **Three**,\nand the **Three** gives birth to all things.\nAll things bear **Yin** while embracing **Yang**,\nand the interplay of **Qi** creates harmony.\nWhat people detest are the lonely, few, and unfilled—\nyet lords and kings take these as their titles.\nThus, things may be diminished to benefit,\nor benefited to diminish.\nWhat people teach is also what I teach.\nThe strong and rigid do not find their proper death—\nI will take this as my teacher’s principle.\"*\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*\"The heart of Heaven and Earth in giving birth to things has no other purpose—\nto block my **substance**,\nto lead my **nature**,\nand to harmonize the **Qi** of **Oneness** alone.\"*\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"That which creates and gives birth does not exhaust itself in merging—\nthis, then, is what?*\n**Succession and harmony** is **the central harmony**.\n\n*The Dao gives birth to **Oneness**,\nwhich is **the Unexcelled** and **the Supreme Unexcelled**.*\n**Oneness** gives birth to the **Two**,\nand the **Twofold Polarities** arise.\nThe **Two** gives birth to the **Three**,\nand the **Three Powers** are established, giving birth to all things.\nThis is called **the Three giving birth to all things**.\n\nAll things bear **Yin** while embracing **Yang**,\nand the interplay of **Qi** creates harmony.\n**Heaven is Yang**, **Earth is Yin**—\nthe **Two Qi** intermingle and resonate,\nrefining their union to coalesce,\na singular point in the void,\nthus forming **succession and harmony**.\n\nThe purest and most refined is **the Human**,\nthe mixed and irregular is **the Material**.\nHumans and things receive their forms—\nbefore and after, bowing and stooping—\nembodying the **Yin-Yang** pattern.\n\nThose who combine the **Three Powers** yet remain **Twofold** are found in me.\nTo uphold **central harmony** is to align with **Heaven and Earth**,\nto nurture all things is to rectify the **Dao**.\n\nAh! **Heaven and Earth** are the parents of all things.\n**Humans** are the **souls** of all things.\nThe **Directly Perceptive and Intelligent** act as the **Primordial Sovereign**,\nthe **Primordial Sovereign** nurtures the people as parents.\nThe **Sage** takes the **Heaven and Earth’s** nurturing of all things and the **people as their children** as his heart.\n\nAlas, in the **Later Ages of the Three Dynasties**,\neach valued **intellect and strength**,\ncontended for land, harming the people,\nthe rulers lost what they cherished,\nthe common folk suffered cruelty.\nThe **Mysterious Sage** embodied **Heaven and Earth’s** nurturing heart,\nfollowing the **Dao’s** **succession and harmony**,\nvaluing **gentleness and weakness**,\nwarning against **rigidity and strength**,\nto teach and nurture the world.\nThus, he used the **lords and kings’** titles of **lonely, few, and unfilled** as an analogy:\n*'What people detest are the lonely, few, and unfilled—\nyet lords and kings take these as their titles.'*\nThis is to uphold **gentleness and weakness**,\nyet **lonely, few, and unfilled** are paradoxically my virtues.\nHow much more so for those below—\nwho may boast of **intellect and strength**,\nyet fail to recognize **rigidity and strength** as warnings?\n\nThus, things may be diminished to benefit,\nor benefited to diminish.\nThose who act in **Heaven’s Way** undetermined,\nwhen human desires burn fiercely,\nknow only to boast of **intellect and strength** as victory.\nThe **gentle** suffer loss,\nthe **strong** gain benefit.\nBut once **Heaven’s Way** is established,\nthe **gentle** are benefited,\nthe **strong** are diminished.\n\nThose who have not heard the **Dao**,\noften value **intellect and strength**,\nflaunt **rigidity and strength**,\nand even teach others that **rigidity and strength** are good—\njust as I uphold **central harmony**,\nguard **gentleness and weakness**,\nand teach others that **gentleness and weakness** are good.\n\nThe **Sage’s** and the **fool’s** perceptions differ as **Heaven and Earth**.\nYet the **strong and rigid** never meet their proper death—\nthis is a warning.\nI will take this as my teacher’s principle.\nTo see the unvirtuous and reflect inwardly is also teaching and admonishing.\n\nTo cultivate oneself without understanding this is to fail in attaining **my central harmony**.\nTo govern the realm without understanding this is to fail in nurturing all things between **Heaven and Earth**.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*'The utmost **gentleness** in the world\novercomes the utmost **firmness** in the world.\nThe **non-existent** enters the **non-gap**.\nI know this is the benefit of **non-action**.\nThe teaching of **non-speech** is the benefit of **non-action**,\nfew in the world can attain it.'*\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*'The previous chapter elucidates the **virtue of succession and harmony**,\nto warn the **strong and rigid** that they will not meet their proper death.\nThis chapter speaks of the **principle of utmost gentleness**,\nto illustrate that it overcomes the **utmost firmness** in the world.\nThese are all **Heaven’s Way** in its natural principles.\nThe **Sage** presents them clearly,\nto warn the world—\nnot merely relying on empty words.\nHow can this be proven?\nObserve the **Heavenly Movement** in the **Supreme Void**,\nancient and modern, ceaseless—\nwho compels it thus?\nThere is a **Bell** that tolls without rest to move it.\nThus it is said:\n*The **floating Heaven** and the **bearing Earth** are **Qi**,\nand **water**.\n**Qi** is the **formless water**,\n**water** is the **formed Qi**.\n**Water**, though **gentle**, conquers **firmness**—\nthe **strong** cannot overcome it.\n**Qi**, though **gentle**, moves and overcomes—\nthe **firmest** cannot resist it.\nThe **Sage** speaks of **utmost gentleness** yet does not mention **Qi**—\n**Qi** is surely present.\n**Heaven**, with its **succession and harmony** of **utmost gentleness**,\noperates through the **dry and firm** body of **the Supreme Unexcelled**—\nthis is **the utmost gentleness** overcoming **the utmost firmness** in the world.\nThe **non-existent** enters the **non-gap**.\nThe **non-existent** is **Qi**.\n**Qi** has no substance—\nthus it is called **non-existent**.\nThe **non-gap** is **emptiness**.\nObserve how the **non-existent Qi** enters the **Supreme Void’s** emptiness—\n**Qi** acts without effort,\nyet the four seasons proceed naturally.\nThe four seasons speak not,\nyet all things are born—\nits benefits are vast indeed.\nThus I know the benefit of **non-action**.\nThe teaching of **non-speech** is the benefit of **non-action**,\nfew in the world can attain it.\n\nThe phrase *\"few in the world can attain it\"* is an exclamation of lament.\nThe **Sage** embodies **Heaven’s Way**,\nyet engages in **non-action** and **non-speech**,\nto teach the world.\nSimple and clear—\nit should be trustworthy.\nYet why are there so few who believe and follow?\nIf belief does not reach them,\nhow can they act accordingly?\nThe **Sage** truly has no desires—\nyet if people must be convinced,\nthe heart naturally laments this phrase,\nwhich cannot be withheld.\n\nThis **Dao** was grasped by **Laozi** and **Confucius**,\nyet they could not practice it in their age—\nthus **Confucius** also had his sigh of *\"I wish to speak but cannot.\"*\nAgain he said:\n*\"If there were someone who used me,\nwould I not make him the **Eastern Zhou**?\"*\nThe **Sage’s** sorrow was for the world,\nand he took the **Dao** upon himself.\nIf this is so,\ncould it be that he truly wished to speak but could not?\nCould it not be that he wished to practice in his age?\nThere must have been reasons he could not—\nand he accepted them.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*'**Name** and **body**—which is closer?\n**Body** and **wealth**—which is more?\n**Gain** and **loss**—which is more harmful?\nThus, the more one loves,\nthe greater the expense.\nThe more one hoards,\nthe greater the loss.\nTo know **sufficiency** is to avoid disgrace.\nTo know **cessation** is to avoid peril.\nThis can endure long.'*\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*'Nurturing life and preserving the body\nis how one preserves **Heaven**.\nTo nurture life without knowing how to preserve the body,\nor to preserve the body without knowing how to preserve **Heaven**,\nis like feeding livestock.\nAll things that possess **Qi** and **body** between **Heaven and Earth**,\nnone lack their own nurturing.\"*\n\nThe *Classic* speaks:\n\n*\"Heaven grants to all things—\neach has its own Dao and measure,\ngreat and small, long and short,\nnot awaiting request,\nyet those who nurture are never without sustenance.\n\nOnly because it is not awaited by seeking,\ndoes one unseen receive what nourishes,\nand when not sought, still not fail to receive what nourishes.\nIf one seeks and yet receives what nourishes,\nor does not seek yet fails to receive what nourishes,\nthen Heaven would favor the private,\nand desire that men obstruct themselves.\n\nIf Heaven desires that men obstruct themselves,\nthen sentient beings would long accumulate what nourishes yet never die,\nand the insentient would fail to receive what nourishes, nearly perishing.\nHow can this be said to reflect Heaven’s utmost fairness?\n\nOnly because it is not awaited by seeking,\ndoes one not dare to seek it.\nThis is how it becomes Heaven.\nWhy alone does man fail to perceive delusion,\nand harbor the heart to seek more sustenance?\n\nIf one harbors the heart to seek more sustenance,\nthen the food of fame and the greed for wealth—\nif not lost here, will be lost there,\nand in reverse, one fails to preserve Heaven’s granted sustenance.\nThis is truly pitiable.\n\nThe Sage pities those who fail to awaken,\nand instructs them:\nCompare fame to the body—\nwhich is closer?\nCompare the body to wealth—\nwhich is more?\nCompare gain to loss—\nwhich is more harmful?\nThe more one loves,\nthe greater the expense.\nThe more one hoards,\nthe greater the loss.\nOnly by knowing sufficiency\nand not loving excessively,\ndoes one avoid disgrace’s harm.\nKnowing cessation\nand not hoarding greatly,\ndoes one avoid peril’s harm.\nThen one may fulfill the goodness of nurturing,\nand Heaven’s granted sustenance will be preserved.\nThis is how one may endure long.\n\nFor the ruler who knows this Dao,\nhe does not await the people’s seeking,\nyet does not neglect what Heaven grants to nourish.\nFor the subject who knows this Dao,\nhe does not dare to seek from above,\nyet remains content with his own self-nourishment.\nNot loving excessively,\nnot hoarding greatly,\nknowing cessation and sufficiency,\neach preserving his own sustenance,\nthen households may endure,\nand states may last long.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*'Great completion seems deficient—\nits use is not exhausted.\nGreat fullness seems empty—\nits use is not spent.\nGreat uprightness seems bent—\ngreat skill seems clumsy,\ngreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\nAgitation overcomes cold,\nstillness overcomes heat,\nand serene stillness is the Way’s rectitude for all under Heaven.'*\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*'The virtue of humility is vast indeed!\nHeaven’s Dao diminishes excess yet benefits humility,\nso the lowly are rescued and radiance is clear.\nGreat completion seems deficient—\nits use is not exhausted.\nEarth’s Dao transforms excess into flowing humility,\nso the lowly ascend upward.\nGreat fullness seems empty—\nits use is not spent.\nGhosts and spirits harm excess yet favor humility,\nso the honored are radiant.\nGreat uprightness seems bent.\n\nHuman nature abhors excess yet loves humility,\nso the lowly are uncrossable.\nGreat skill seems clumsy.\n\nThe gentleman practices *kǎo* (积) the many and aiding the few,\nbalancing things with just application.\nGreat eloquence seems hesitant.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold—\nthe earth lies above the mountains.\nStillness overcomes heat—\nthe mountains lie below the earth.\nSerene stillness is the Way’s rectitude for all under Heaven.\nHumility is the gentleman’s virtue,\nand all the people serve it.\n\nAh! The Dao of the *Book of Changes* and the *Laozi*,\nthough named differently, springs from the same source.\nThe *Dao De Jing* unfolds in the mound and classic texts,\nthe *Yijing* manifests in diagrams and words.\nAll observe Heaven’s Dao to illuminate human nature.\n\nThe previous chapter speaks of fame and wealth\nto warn against excessive love and hoarding,\nand of gain and loss\nto clarify knowing cessation and sufficiency—\nthus the meaning of *kǎo* (积), aiding, and balanced application, is evident.\n\nThis chapter speaks of those who sing of ‘unknowing sufficiency’,\nand desire gain to avoid blame and calamity,\nthus the virtue of humility is clear.\n\nSome say: *‘Shèng’* (胜) means ‘extreme’.\nExtreme agitation brings cold,\nextreme stillness brings heat—\nthis is speaking of *Qi*.\nSome say: Agitation can overcome cold,\nstillness can overcome heat—\nthis is speaking of *Dao*.\n\nHumility is present indeed.\nYet then the *Hexagram of Humility*’s sixth line says:\n*'Not enriching oneself with neighbors,\nbeneficial to use slander to invade and plunder.'*\nAnd the top line says: *‘Resounding humility,\nbeneficial to use troops to march and conquer states.’*\nBut this lower chapter says:\n*'When the Way prevails under Heaven,\nthe war-horses are turned back to manure.\nWhen the Way does not prevail under Heaven,\nwar-horses are born in the suburbs.'*\nThen humility’s words of invasion and marching troops—\nis this not untenable?\n\nKnowing lowliness yet uncrossable,\n*aiding the many and the few* with balanced application—\nthis is acceptable.\nIf one must reach the point where war-horses are born in the suburbs,\nwhat need has humility of such?\n\nThe Sage’s Dao of the *Laozi* teaches\nthat softness overcomes hardness,\nthus aligning with humility.\nYet Shen Buhai and Han Fei failed to learn well,\ndescending into legalism and name-schooling,\nbecoming the wretched offenders of the Sage’s gate for ten thousand ages.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*'When the Way prevails under Heaven,\nthe war-horses are turned back to manure.\nWhen the Way does not prevail under Heaven,\nwar-horses are born in the suburbs.\nNo crime is greater than desiring gain,\nno calamity greater than unknowing sufficiency,\nno blame greater than coveting what is obtained.'*\nThus, the sufficiency of sufficiency,\nis always sufficiency.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*'The ancient rulers of all under Heaven—\nthe vastness of their lands,\nthe multitude of their people,\nthe longevity of their sovereigns—\nfrom Yao and Shun onward,\ntoo distant to trace.\nYet in the words of the *Yugong*,\nwe see that Yao’s and Shun’s reigns\neastward reached the sea,\nwestward extended to the flowing sands,\nnorthward to the boundless frontier,\nand their teachings spread to all four seas.\nTheir people matched their lands.\n\nYao ruled as Son of Heaven,\nShun, Yu, Ji, Xie, and Gao Yao as ministers.\nThey swayed the people with ease—\nnone could name their virtue.\nManifest in the *Strike-the-Earth* song,\nwe know them as the age of the Way’s prevalence.\nYao was not yet very old,\nyet he yielded the throne to Shun.\nShun followed Yao’s Dao,\nnot yet very old,\nyet he yielded the throne to Yu.\nYao and Shun,\nthough not losing Heaven’s honor and eminence,\nboth lived over a hundred years,\nand their descendants did not lose their lands’ boundaries,\nnor abandon the duty of ancestral sacrifices.\nSuch as the two Sages,\ncan truly be called sufficiency’s sufficiency—\nalways sufficiency.\n\nWhen the Way prevails under Heaven,\nthe war-horses are turned back to manure—\nthe prosperity of Tang and Yu is evident.\nWhen the Way does not prevail under Heaven,\nwar-horses are born in the suburbs—\nthe decline of Xia and Shang is evident.\nNo crime is greater than desiring gain—\nexcessive love brings great expense.'*\n\nMisfortune knows no greater than the failure to know sufficiency—\nexcessive hoarding brings swift ruin.\n\nNo fault is greater than the desire to possess—\nwhat I desire to possess, others also desire to possess.\nWhy then would the world not contend?\nWhy would war-horses not multiply?\n\nTo flee what is without the Way\nand seek what is with the Way,\nis better than enduring the decline of Xia and Shang,\nand striving for the prosperity of Tang and Yu.\nTo know sufficiency is to always suffice—\nthus one will not lose the eminence of Yao and Shun.\n\nYet if the Way prevails under Heaven,\nit must have rulers like Yao and Shun,\nministers like Gao Yao and Kui,\nand people like those of Tang and Yu—\nthen every household may be ennobled,\nand all will recognize the weight of the world,\nwithout harming their own lives.\n\nWho then would bear the guilt of desire,\nthe calamity of insatiability,\nthe fault of covetousness?\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nWithout leaving one’s door, one knows the world.\nWithout peering through a window, one sees the Way of Heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\n\nThus the Sage acts without knowing,\nnames without seeing,\naccomplishes without doing.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\nWithout leaving one’s door, one knows the world—\nthis is the speech of the Sage who follows the Way.\nWho else but Yu and Yi refused Yao’s abdication?\n\nWithout peering through a window, one sees the Way of Heaven—\nYu declined Yao’s throne, saying:\n“The sun and moon have risen,\ntimely rains descend,\nthe glow of torches and the nourishment of irrigation—\nare they not difficult and laborious?”\n\nYu’s refusal to descend from Mount Ji,\nthis was how he knew the world.\nOnce order is established,\nthe farther one goes, the less one knows—\nthis is the fate of those who stop at insatiability.\nThe Way does not prevail, yet they know—\nthis is why Yu did not succeed Yao.\n\n“To name without seeing”—\nshall I seek fame?\nOr shall I be a guest?\n\n“To accomplish without doing”—\nI have no need of the world’s affairs.\n\nYu’s refusal of Yao’s abdication\nwas to achieve eternal renown without leaving his door—\nperhaps he was even more virtuous than Yao.\n\nThe cow of Chu Fu\nwould not drink from the Washui River—\nthis was to bear no name of right or wrong without peering through a window,\nand thus surpass even Yu.\n\nYao passed the Mandate to Shun,\nShun to Yu.\nYao and Shun were Sages with both the Way and position,\nChu Fu and Yu were Sages with the Way but without position.\nThose like Chu Fu and Yu\ncan be said to have no fame yet achieve fame—\nthis is to accomplish without doing.\n\nZhuangzi and Huizi observed fish by the Hao Pond.\nZhuangzi said:\n“The carp glides leisurely—\nthis fish is joyful.”\n\nHuizi said:\n“You are not a fish—\nhow do you know the fish is joyful?”\n\nZhuangzi replied:\n“I know it at the Hao Pond.\nThe waters of the Hao are deep,\nnets cannot reach them,\nand the fish do not need to leap from the pond.\nYet I know that in all the world’s waters,\nthere are still nets that harm them.\nThus they rejoice in their leisure,\nand do not emerge.”\n\nThe fish’s refusal to leap from the Hao Pond\nis like Chu Fu and Yu’s refusal to descend from Mount Ji.\n\nAlas! Without the Later Kings,\nwe could not see the Sagehood of Yao and Shun.\nWithout Yao and Shun,\nwe could not see the exalted virtue of Chu Fu and Yu.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nTo study is to daily increase,\nto follow the Way is to daily decrease.\nDecrease until it is empty,\nuntil there is no doing—\nno doing, yet nothing remains undone.\nTo take the world,\none must act with non-action.\nWhen action arises,\nit is insufficient to take the world.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\nTo study is to increase—\nthis is the way of the common people.\nTo follow the Way is to decrease—\nthis is the way of the Sage.\n\nThe wise cannot lack human-heartedness,\nthe foolish cannot lack Dao-heartedness.\nWhen Yao entrusted the Mandate to Shun, he said:\n“Hold fast to the Mean—\nwhat more could be subtracted?”\n\nWhen Shun entrusted the Mandate to Yu,\nhe added words of human-heartedness, Dao-heartedness, and perilous subtlety—\nthis was what could not be avoided in decreasing.\n\nTo decrease again and again,\nuntil there is no doing—\nno doing, yet nothing remains undone.\n“Decrease” means to remove human desires.\n“Decrease again” means to purge human desires utterly.\nWhen human desires are purged,\nthere is no indulging in self.\nWithout indulging in self,\nall that is done is what Heaven’s principle demands,\nand cannot but be done.\n\nAs Yu’s flood control—\npassing his door three times without entering—\nhis labor is evident.\nYet he said, *“Act in what is without doing,”*\nthus revealing that all Yu did\nwas what must be done and could not be avoided.\n\n“To take the world” means not to take\nthe world’s lands and people,\nits dogs and horses, its jade and silk.\nIt means to take joy in what others deem good.\n“Without doing” means to act in what is without doing.\nOnly by taking joy in what others deem good\nand acting in what is without doing\nwill the world rally to you,\nas water flows downward.\n\nWhen action arises,\nit is insufficient to take the world.\n“Action” means forcing others to follow you\nbecause you believe none are your equal—\nthis is the way of the common people.\nHow could it suffice to take the world?\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\nDo not deviate from the Way to seek the people’s praise,\nnor deceive the people to satisfy your desires.\nThese words are well taken.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nThe Sage has no fixed heart,\nbut takes the hearts of the people as heart.\nThe good, I make good;\nthe ungood, I also make good—virtue is good.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nthe untrustworthy, I also trust—virtue is trust.\nThe Sage moves through the world with solemnity,\nharmonizing the hearts of the people.\nThe people all focus their ears and eyes,\nwhile the Sage treats them like infants.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\nThe Sage responds to things without being preceded by them,\nthus having no fixed heart.\nThis follows the meaning of the previous chapter:\nvirtue and the Way can be constant,\nbut the heart cannot be constant.\nThe heart of the Sage is vast as the sky without clouds,\nstill as water without ripples.\nFish leap, kites fly—\nnothing escapes its response.\nThus the Sage unifies all things,\nand flows with the high and low,\nharmonizing with Heaven and Earth,\ntaking the hearts of the people as heart.\n\nWith the hearts of the people as my own,\nthen there is nothing that does not respond naturally—\nI simply respond to it with the Way.\n\nThe virtuous, I respond to with virtue—\nthe unvirtuous, I also respond to with virtue—**virtue is virtue**.\nThe trustworthy, I respond to with trust—\nthe untrustworthy, I also respond to with trust—**virtue is trust**.\n\nVirtue has no constant teacher,\nbut takes virtue itself as its teacher.\nThus, all virtue under Heaven is virtue,\nand no one fails to be virtuous.\n\nWith trust as the trust of all under Heaven,\nno one fails to be trustworthy.\n\nThe Sage moves through the world with solemnity,\nharmonizing the hearts of all people.\nThe Sage with **positioned speech**—\nlike **Emperor Yao** in his **tolerant governance** of all.\n\n**Shun told Yu**:\n*\"Consult the multitude,\nabandon self to follow others,\ndo not oppress the helpless,\ndo not neglect the poor and destitute.\nOnly when the **Emperor’s timing** is perfect,\ndoes solemnity and harmonization of hearts appear.\"*\n\nThe people all focus their ears and eyes,\nwhile Heaven sees as the people see,\nHeaven hears as the people hear—\nvirtue and transformation spread,\nwhere hearts naturally turn.\nThe Sage treats them all as infants—\n**one regards them with the eyes of a赤子 (*baby/innocent child*).**\n\nAs for **啮缺 (*Niè Kuē*)**, though he could be the father of the multitude,\nhe could not be the father of the multitude’s father—\nhe was but a single step removed from **Emperor Yao**.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"To be born and enter death,\nthose who belong to life are thirteen in ten,\nthose who belong to death are thirteen in ten.\nHumans who live,\nthirteen in ten move toward death’s domain.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause of the **thick nourishment of life**.*\n\nI have heard that those who skillfully **cultivate life (*shè shēng*)***\nwalk on land and do not meet **兕 (*rú*)** or tigers,\nenter armies and are not struck by weapons or soldiers.\n**兕 (*rú*)** have nowhere to lodge their horns,\ntigers have nowhere to place their claws,\nsoldiers have nowhere to wield their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no **death’s domain** for them.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*\"All things under Heaven and Earth,\nnone do not have **clans** and **ancestors**.\n**Clans** refer to their multitude,\n**ancestors** refer to their intimacy.\nThis is the great **连庐 (*lián lú*)** of Heaven and Earth and all things.\nTo be born and enter death—\nlife brings death,\ndeath brings life—\nthis is the constant principle of Heaven.\nHow could the heart interfere with it?\n\nKnowing my **出 (*chū*)** and **入 (*rù*)**—\nnever having been born,\nnever having died—\nthen who are those who belong to life?\nWho are those who belong to death?\nAnd who are those who belong to neither life nor death?\n\nLife is thirteen in ten,\ndeath is thirteen in ten,\nneither life nor death is thirteen in ten—\nthis makes nine.\nWhat kind of thing is this?\n\nThe **Dao** is tenfold,\nthe **三才 (*Three Powers*)** each take their three,\nand the remaining one is the **祖 (*ancestor*)** of **太极 (*Tàijí*)**.\nThose who belong to life are the **天三阳 (*Heaven’s Three Yang*)**—\nlight and clear **气 (*qi*)**, the kin of the sun, moon, and stars.\nThose who belong to death are the **地三阴 (*Earth’s Three Yin*)**—\nheavy and turbid **气 (*qi*)**, the kin of mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees.\nThose who belong to neither life nor death are the **人三元 (*Human’s Three Elements*)**—\n**冲和 (*chōng hé*)** **气 (*qi*)**, the kin of **精 (*jing*)**, **气 (*qi*)**, and **神 (*shén*)**.\n\nHumans as humans,\nnone do not combine these **Three Powers**,\nwhile also embracing the **祖 (*ancestor*)** of **太极 (*Tàijí*)**,\nthus attaining their life.\nThis is what **Mencius** called:\n*'All things are complete within me'*—\nhumans are thus noble as well.\n\nHaving attained their life,\nthey do not regard it as their own.\nThose who **nourish their ancestor** while being intimate,\nyet **move toward death’s domain**—\nthis is truly pitiful.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they forget their own source of nobility,\nyet seek externally to add to their nourishment,\nincreasing their **thick nourishment of life**.\nThis is called **calculating on the left**—\nonce the heart is set upon this,\nthey will **enter tiger’s dens** and **tread upon white blades**,\nunmindful of peril and ruin,\nand none will refrain.\n\nI have heard that those who skillfully **cultivate life (*shè shēng*)***\nwalk on land and do not meet **兕 (*rú*)** or tigers—\nthey have no **心 (*heart*)** of entering dens.\nEnter armies and are not struck by weapons or soldiers—\nthey have no **心 (*heart*)** of treading blades.\nFrom where does **兕 (*rú*)** come to lodge its horns?\nFrom where does the tiger come to place its claws?\nFrom where do soldiers come to wield their blades?\nWhy is this so?\nBecause I have no **death’s domain**,\nand thus nothing can harm me.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The Dao **gives birth** to it,\n**virtue** **nurtures** it,\nthings **take form** from it,\n**势 (*shì*)** **completes** it.\nThus all things do not fail to **revere the

(*Xuán Dé*)** **virtue/power**.\"*\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*\"The Dao gives birth,\nvirtue nurtures,\nthings take form,\n**势 (*shì*)** completes—\nthis follows the meaning of the previous

said:\n**'The Dao gives birth, nurtures, lengthens, rears, completes, ripens, nourishes, and covers.\nIt gives birth yet does not possess,\nacts yet does not rely,\nlengthens yet does not

before Heaven and Earth took form,\nthe beginning before there was any beginning—\nits origin is ancient indeed.\nHow could one not say that the **Divine One** attains **spirituality** through **Oneness**?\n\nThe Dao speaks of **Divine Clarity**,\nthe Release School speaks of **Spiritual Radiance**,\nthe Confucian speaks of **Keen Insight**—\nall speak of the same beginning.\n\nThis is called the **mother** of the world.\nThe **mother** is that from which all things emerge.\nNo one lacks this mother.\nHaving obtained the mother, **spirituality** is born from **clarity**,\nand knowing its children, **clarity** gives rise to **radiance**.\n\nHaving known its children, return and safeguard its mother—\nknow that its radiance must be guarded,\nits clarity must not depart.\nWhen radiance does not depart from clarity,\nthen **Divine Clarity** is preserved.\nThough the body perishes, the clarity will not fail.\n\nThe mother is also **qi**.\nThe child is **spirit**.\nWhen **spirit** and **qi** guard each other,\nthen **radiance** and **clarity** arise.\n\nThe **Nurture-Life** school speaks of\nsealing the senses and lowering the curtain,\nretracting sight and returning hearing—\nthis is rooted in this principle.\n\nTo close the senses’ openings, shut the gates—\nthis is the **Way** for oneself.\nInternally attaining its nourishment,\nthen **Divine Clarity** is preserved.\nWhen **Divine Clarity** is preserved,\nthen one’s whole life will know no toil is fitting.\n\nTo open the senses’ openings, aid in affairs—\nthis is the **Way** for others.\nExternally attaining its nourishment,\nthen it manifests as deeds and enterprises.\nWhen enterprises are accomplished,\nthen one’s whole life will know no regret is fitting.\n\nThus, **Fu Xi** attained it to **inherit the mother’s qi**,\nthe **Yellow Emperor** attained it to **ascend to the Clouded Sky**,\nwhile **Tang and Wu** with their lifespans of no more than a hundred years,\nplotted to establish enterprises lasting a thousand ages.\n\nThe **Way** of **inner Sagehood and outer Kingship** differs thus.\n\nTo see what is small is called **clarity**—\nknowing the subtle and the manifest.\nSmallness carries the meaning of **children**.\nTo hold fast to softness is called **strength**—\nknowing softness and hardness.\nSoftness carries the meaning of **mother**.\n\nTo employ its radiance—radiance of the **child**,\nthe **mother** summons her **child**.\nTo return and restore its clarity—clarity of the **mother**,\nthe **child** hides within the **mother’s womb**.\nThis is the **Way** of knowing the **child** and safeguarding the **mother**.\n\nIf guarded without loss,\nthen calamity will not reach the body—\nthis is called **clinging to the constant**.\n**Clinging** means **uniting**.\nUniting with the **Great Constant**—\nthis is called **\"steadfastly holding the central\"**,\nthis is called **\"standing alone, unchanging\"**,\nthis is called **\"not leading the myriad laws\"**—\nall share this **Way**.\n\nIs this not the **Great Man’s** exit from the world,\nhis accomplishments fulfilled and name established?\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Let me be resolutely aware—\nwalking the Great Dao,\nonly reverence is feared.\nThe Great Dao is smooth,\nyet people love shortcuts.\nThe court is ever more empty,\nthe fields ever more overgrown,\nthe granaries ever more bare.\nThey wear embroidered robes,\nbelt sharp swords,\ncarry food and goods—\nwealth overflows.\nThis is called **robber’s boast**—\nnot the Dao indeed.\"*\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\nThe **Old Sage** sighed at the decline of the Three Dynasties,\nwhen feudal lords contended for hegemony,\nthe people barely surviving,\nand thus composed words to lament himself:\n*\"Let me be resolutely aware of governance—\nwalking the Great Dao,\nonly reverence is feared.\nYour words do not stir strife.\nIf the ruler does not stir strife, the people are at ease,\nand the people at ease, the state is governed.\nThis is called **‘no neglect, no waste’**—\nthe four quarters bring tribute as kings.\nThe Great Dao is the **straight path**.\nThe **shortcut** is the **byway**.\nSpeaking of how, at that time, feudal lords and great ministers\npursued merit through martial prowess,\nloved wealth and indulged in luxury,\nabandoning the straight path and not following it,\nprioritizing schemes that sparked contention across the land.\n\nThe court is ever more empty—\nofficials proliferate, palaces grow extravagant.\nThe fields are ever more overgrown—\nthe people scatter, farmlands lie fallow.\nThe granaries are ever more bare—\ngrain is depleted, storehouses are utterly empty.\n\nClothing should suffice to cover the body—\nwhy adorn with embroidery?\nThe belt should suffice for stability—\nwhy carry a sharp sword?\nFood should suffice to fill the stomach—\nwhy indulge in rich delicacies to gluttony?\nWealth should suffice for practical use—\nwhy hoard treasures beyond necessity?\n\nAll these bring no benefit to life,\nyet harm governance.\nThis is called **robbery’s boast of wealth**—\nnot the Sage’s **Way**.\"*\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The well-built does not topple,\nthe well-embraced does not slip,\nand descendants offer unbroken sacrifices.\nCultivate it in the self, its virtue becomes **true**.\nCultivate it in the family, its virtue becomes **abundant**.\nCultivate it in the village, its virtue becomes **long-lasting**.\nCultivate it in the state, its virtue becomes **prosperous**.\nCultivate it in the world, its virtue becomes **universal**.\nThus, observe the self to understand the self,\nobserve the family to understand the family,\nobserve the village to understand the village,\nobserve the state to understand the state,\nobserve the world to understand the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\"*\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\nThe establishment of the *Hong Fan* [Classic]\nuses the **Royal Pivot** to set an example for the people.\nThe Sage’s **embracing of Oneness**\nis the model for the world,\nthe foundation for establishing the people’s fate.\n\nTo **build** must be like Heaven and Earth’s **upright mountains**,\neternally unshaken—\nto **embrace** must be like rivers and seas **encompassing the land**,\neternally unbroken—\nonly then can one speak of **excellence**.\n\n**Yu** completed the waterworks,\nextended the Five Regions outward,\napproaching the Four Seas,\nestablishing the Five Ministers—\nhow could this not be **unshaken**?\nWith ancestral temples and people—\nhow could this not be **unbroken**?\nWith the virtue of **Qi’s** descendants,\npassed down through generations,\nhow could sacrifices not continue?\nYet see **Yu’s** ancestor,\nand **Jie’s** descendant.\n**Jie’s** virtue was in darkness,\nthe people plunged into suffering—\nonce the people’s hearts departed,\nthe ancestral temples were lost.\nWhere are the ancestral sacrifices now?\nThis is because **Jie** failed to know\n**self-cultivation** reaching this far.\n**Shang’s** **Zhou** was the same.\n\nThus the Sage could not but speak—\nfor from the Son of Heaven to the commoner,\nall must take **self-cultivation** as the foundation.\nYet the **true Dao** is for governing the self,\nits remnants for governing the state,\nits dregs for governing the world.\n\n「When governance grows broader, the Dao grows more distant—\none must know what to guard with caution.\n\nCultivate within the self,\nand its virtue becomes true.\nGuard carefully the cultivation of the self,\nand the true virtue is attained.\n\nCultivate within the family,\nand its virtue becomes the remnant.\nIf one can master the family,\nthen blessings shall overflow abundantly.\n\nCultivate within the village,\nand its virtue becomes enduring.\nThus one becomes a friend to the virtuous of the village.\n\nCultivate within the state,\nand its virtue becomes abundant.\nAll its people shall take delight in it.\n\nCultivate within the world,\nand its virtue becomes universal.\nAll under heaven shall admire it.\n\nTherefore, to observe the self through the self,\nthe self shall be cultivated.\nTo observe the family through the family,\nthe family shall be harmonized.\nTo observe the village through the village,\nthe village shall flourish.\nTo observe the state through the state,\nthe state shall be well-ordered.\nTo observe the world through the world,\nthe world shall be in peace.\n\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy observing through this Dao—\nthen it can be understood.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nThe depth of virtue is like that of an infant.\nVenomous insects do not sting,\nferocious beasts do not attack,\nand crows do not swoop.\nThough bones are frail and sinews soft,\nits grasp is firm.\nIt knows not the union of male and female,\nyet cries when needed—\nthe utmost purity of essence.\n\nAll day it weeps without hoarseness,\nthe utmost harmony of qi.\nTo know harmony is to know constancy,\nto know constancy is to know clarity,\nto nurture life is auspicious,\nto let the heart command the qi is strength.\n\nWhen things reach their peak,\nthey grow old—\nthis is called *not the Dao*,\nand *not the Dao* brings early decline.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\nThe depth of virtue—\nthe previous chapter spoke of cultivating virtue and observing virtue,\nnot mentioning what virtue lies in,\nbut here it speaks of the depth of virtue,\ncomparing it to an infant.\nThus the virtue of an infant is virtue itself.\n\nObserving its essence complete and qi harmonized,\nits softness and weakness as true constancy,\nthe virtue of an infant is evident.\nAs for venomous insects, ferocious beasts, and ravenous crows,\nall are the utmost evil of things,\nwith hearts of poison and harm,\nyet they do not sting, attack, or swoop upon the infant.\nThis has no other reason—\nit is the utmost power of gentle virtue.\n\nIn the chapter of birth and death,\nthere is no death,\nand its virtue resembles this.\nThese venomous insects are all creatures with poison,\nyet they lack wisdom.\nThey still do not harm the infant,\nhow much less would the wise harm it?\nYet those evil men, though they act unvirtuously,\nare they truly without wisdom?\nThey simply lack the capacity to inflict harm.\n\nThe infant’s bones are frail, sinews soft—\ninitially, it has no great strength,\nyet its grasp is firm.\nIt knows not the union of male and female,\ninitially having no carnal desires,\nyet cries when needed—\nthe utmost purity of essence.\n\nAll day it weeps without hoarseness,\nthe utmost harmony of qi.\nHarmony is the constancy of virtue,\nto know harmony is to know constancy,\nto know constancy is to know clarity,\nand clarity encompasses all without exclusion.\n\nTo nurture life is auspicious,\nand auspiciousness is omens.\nWith a heart that nurtures life,\neven virtue becomes ominous.\n\nTo let the heart command the qi is strength—\nthe heart of one near death.\nTo let the heart command the qi is the sign of one nearing death.\n\nWhen things reach their peak,\nthey grow old,\nand old they die—\nthis is called *not the Dao*.\nThis has no other reason—\nwhen gentle virtue is lost,\nit is not a lasting way,\nonly early decline.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nThe wise do not speak,\nthose who speak lack wisdom.\nBlock the mouth of the *Jue* [1],\nclose the gates of the *Men* [2],\ndull the sharp,\nuntangle the chaotic,\nharmonize the light,\nblend with the dust—\nthis is called *mysterious observation*.\n\nOne cannot draw near or keep at a distance,\ncannot profit or harm,\ncannot elevate or degrade—\nthus it is held in highest honor by all under heaven.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\nThose who harbor the Dao\ncan be sullied or exalted,\nrise and fall with the times,\nbe seen as foolish or wise,\nfloat and sink with the world.\n\nLike the hidden few of Nan Guo Zi Ran,\nor the feigned simplicity of Yan Zi,\nthis is the wise who do not speak.\nLike the disputations of Gong Sun Long,\nthis is the speaker who lacks wisdom.\nHis wisdom is attainable,\nhis foolishness is not.\n\nTo block the *Jue* and close the gates,\nto dull the sharp and untangle the chaotic,\nto harmonize the light and blend with the dust—\nthese six are mysteriously unified,\nthus one cannot draw near or keep at a distance,\nlacking a heart of praise or encouragement.\nOne cannot profit or harm,\nlacking a heart of covetousness or malice.\nOne cannot elevate or degrade,\nlacking a heart of ambition or disgrace.\n\nAll these are insufficient to burden the heart,\nthus one can remain at ease in the times and顺顺 [3],\nliving as if floating,\ndying as if resting—\ndeath and life bring no change to oneself,\nhow much less the matters of profit and harm?\nThus one can be like the deep stillness before thunder,\nmysteriously unified with all phenomena,\nmoving divinely as heaven follows,\nwithout revealing its jade-like angles,\nso that the common folk may not recognize it—\nhence it is held in highest honor by all under heaven.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nGovern the state with *zhèng* [4],\nemploy *qí* [5] in warfare,\nand take the world with no action.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe world has many taboos,\nyet the people grow poorer.\nThe people have many tools of profit,\nyet the state grows more chaotic.\nMen have many clever arts,\nyet strange things proliferate.\nLaws and decrees grow ever more prominent,\nyet thieves and robbers abound.\nThus the Sage says:\nI take no action,\nyet the people transform themselves.\nI love tranquility,\nyet the people become upright.\nI have no affairs,\nyet the people grow rich.\nI have no desires,\nyet the people return to simplicity.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*Zhèng* is governance.\nThe myriad achievements of Yao were all harmonious,\nand the hundred measures of Shun were timely and ordered—\nthis is to govern the state with *zhèng*.\n\n*Qí* is the variation of *zhèng*.\nYu’s battle-array was marshaled for seven months,\nand the Miao tribes were subdued—\nthis is to employ *qí* in warfare.\nTang [6] waged war because Jie’s descendant failed to sacrifice,\nand thus he extinguished eleven states.\nJie, though abandoned, still possessed the myriad Xia—\nthis was the next degree of *qí*.\n\nThe Zhou [7] waged war because Jie’s descendant did not follow the Dao,\nand at the great assembly at the River Jin,\nthey battled at Mu Ye,\nand Jie’s descendant, though burned, still held the myriad Shang—\nthis was yet another degree of *qí*.\n\nThe *Art of War* says:\nThe highest warfare is to strike the plans,\nthe next is to sever alliances,\nthe next is to strike the armies.»\n\n---\n[1] *Jue* (兑) – The *Jue* hexagram in the *Yijing* (Classic of Changes), representing joy, exhilaration, or the mouth.\n[2] *Men* (门) – The

expedition against **Xià** (夏), and **Zhōu’s** assault on **Shāng** (商), we see the principle at work.\n\nWhen this is carried further, the *Qí* (奇) transforms into *Zhà* (诈)—deception—\nand deception then gives rise to *Luàn* (乱)—chaos.\n\nTo acquire the realm with no action of one’s own,\nis to embody the *Zhāng Mò* (章末) doctrine of *Wúwéi* (无为) and love of stillness,\nof *Wúshì* (无事) and *Wúyù* (无欲).\n\nHow do I know this to be true?\nFor when the **Zhōu** dynasty declined in the middle,\nKing **Lì** (厉王) coveted profit,\nand appointing **Róng Gōng** (荣公) as his minister,\nhe monopolized gain and harmed the people,\nso when the **Wèi** (卫) perverts and **Wū** (巫) censors reported him,\nhe had them killed.\nThe land was filled with taboos,\nyet the people grew ever poorer.\n\nThe **Huái Yí** (淮夷) raided in rebellion,\nand the people rose up against one another.\nKing **Yōu** (幽王) fled to **Jìng** (竞),\nand the **Gònghè** (共和) administration took charge,\nas the people multiplied their clever devices\nand the state flourished in corruption.\n\nKing **Yōu** (幽王) grew dissolute and debauched,\nand appointed **Shí Fù** (石父) as his minister,\nwho was skilled in flattery and profit-seeking,\nentrusted with affairs and given full authority,\nhis governance filled with perversity,\nso some lords rebelled,\nwhile the **Róng-Dí** (戎狄) slew him.\n\nWhen men abound in cunning arts,\nstrange contrivances multiply,\nlaws and decrees grow ever more explicit,\nand thieves and robbers proliferate.\n\nThus the sage says:\n*\"If I act with **Wúwéi** (无为), the people will transform themselves;\nIf I love **jìng** (静), the people will become upright;\nIf I have **Wúshì** (无事), the people will grow rich;\nIf I have **Wúyù** (无欲), the people will return to simplicity.\"*\n\nThe words of the ancient sages,\nthe **Xuánshèng** (玄圣) cites them as proof,\nare they not in accord with the sayings of *Fén* (坟) and *Diǎn* (典)?\n\nIn the second year of King **Yōu** (幽王),\nthe three rivers of the **Xī Zhōu** (西周) trembled.\nThe Grand Historian **Bó Yáng Fù** (伯阳父) declared:\n*\"In days past, when the **Yí** (伊) and **Luò** (洛) rivers dried up, **Xià** (夏) perished;\nwhen the **Jiāng** (江) river dried up, **Shāng** (商) perished.\nNow the **Zhōu** (周) **virtue** (德) is like that of the three dynasties in their decline—\nthey will not endure beyond the count of ten years.\"*\n\nThat year, the three rivers dried up,\nand the **Qí Shān** (岐山) collapsed.\nThree years later, the **Shēn Hòu** (申侯) was deposed,\nand the former heir **Yí Jiù** (宜臼) was removed,\nwhile favor was bestowed upon **Bào Sì** (褒姒) as queen,\nand her son **Bó Fú** (伯服) was made heir.\n\nThe **Bó Yáng** (伯阳) read the records and said:\n*\"The **Zhōu** (周) is already destroyed.\"*\n\nIn the eleventh year, the king sought to kill the former heir **Yí Jiù** (宜臼),\nand marched against **Shēn** (申).\nThe **Shēn Hòu** (申侯) allied with the **Dèng** (邓) people,\nsummoning the **Xī Yí** (西夷) and **Quǎn Róng** (犬戎),\nto attack and slay the king,\nand install the former heir **Yí Jiù** (宜臼) as **Píng Wáng** (平王).\nHe relocated to the **East Capital** (东都),\nand the **West Capital** (西周) was indeed abandoned.\n\n**Bó Yáng** (伯阳), surnamed **Lǎoshèng** (老圣),\nonce served **Xī Bó** (西伯) as the **Cángshǐ** (藏史),\nand under King **Chéng** (成王) as **Zhùxiàshǐ** (柱下史),\nwhile in the time of King **Yōu** (幽王) he was the **Grand Historian** (太史).\nHe cultivated the **Dao** (道) and nourished his years,\noften holding the **Shìkuài** (史快) office,\nand expounding the *Xuánjīng* (玄经).\nHis divinations and records endure for ten thousand generations—\nthis is what I call the **nameless ancient historian** (无名古史),\nwhose truth can now be verified.\n\nThough his station was that of a subject,\nhis **Dao** (道) surpassed that of a hundred kings—\nhe was a sage who held the **Dao** (道) yet lacked position.\n\nThe *Jīng* (经) states:\n*\"When governance is **mènmèn** (闷闷) [deep and unobtrusive],\nits people are **chúnhún** (淳淳) [pure and sincere].\nWhen governance is **cháhè** (察察) [sharp and scrutinizing],\nits people are **quēquē** (缺缺) [deficient and cunning].\"*\n\nMisfortune, oh, where fortune leans,\nFortune, oh, where misfortune lurks—\nWho knows their ultimate measure?\nIs it not the absence of **Zhèng** (正)?\n\n**Zhèng** (正) becomes *Qí* (奇),\n**Shàn** (善) becomes *Yāo* (妖).\nThe people’s confusion is indeed long-standing.\n\nThus the sage is square yet does not cut,\nhonest yet not harsh,\nupright yet not domineering,\nbright yet not dazzling.\n\nThe *Yuanzhǐ* (原旨) says:\n*\"Governance like that of **Fūzǐ** (夫子) [the sage],\nwhere **virtue** (德) is the foundation of **mènmèn** (闷闷) governance,\nand **Lǐ** (礼) is used for harmonization—\nits policies are broad and expansive,\nand the people take joy in their work,\nwhile customs become **chúnhún** (淳淳) and **cháhè**

(汤) waged war because of **Gě Bó** (葛伯)’s failure to worship,\nyet his guilt surpassed that of **Jié** (桀),\nand through **Zhōu** (周), **Shàn** (善) became *Yāo* (妖).\nThe people’s confusion is indeed

having a realm—this is the Dao of enduring roots and lasting life (长生久视).\"*\n\n*The Original Meaning says:*\n*\"To govern people is to nourish their exterior (外).*\n*Knowing what the body should nourish, one knows what people and all things should nourish.*\n*To serve Heaven is to nourish the interior (内).*\n*Knowing what the heart should nourish, one knows what spirit (精) should nourish.*\n*All that Heaven bestows within us—none should be neglected in nourishment.*\n*The way of nourishment is none other than *yin* (音).*\n*Frugality (啬) is the preservation of love (保爱).*\n*Only *yin*—this is called early cultivation (早服).*\n*Diligent cultivation is the method of nourishment.*\n*Early cultivation is called the accumulation of profound virtue (重积德).*\n*Only by

harm people—*\n*the Sage also does not harm people.*\n*When neither harms the other, virtue returns in exchange (德交归).\"*\n\n*The Original Meaning says:*\n*\"To govern a great realm, treat it as if boiling a small fish (小鲜).*\n*A small fish (鲜)—a tiny fish.*\n*Boiling a tiny fish—disturb it and it disintegrates, overheat it and it disintegrates; there is a middle way (中道).*\n*A great realm is

The people are Heaven’s cherished children (赤子),*\n*The ruler is Heaven’s eldest child (元子).*\n*The eldest is the longest in virtue (善之长).*\n*If the eldest does not harm the young, Heaven will surely aid them—*\n*this is called neither harming the other, thus virtue returns in exchange (德交归).*\n*By this, it is seen that Heaven has no favorites—*\n*only virtue does it assist.\"*\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"A great realm is the confluence (下流), the intersection of the world (天下之交),*\n*the world’s intersection is the receptive (牝).*\n*The receptive ever conquers the assertive (牡) through

the great realm.*\n*Thus, sometimes one humbles to take, sometimes one humbles and takes.*\n*A great realm seeks only to shelter people,*\n*A small realm seeks only to submit to service.*\n*Both obtain what they desire, thus the great should properly humble itself.\"*\n\n*The Original Meaning says:*\n*\"A great realm is the confluence (下流), the intersection of the world (天下之交)—*\n*like when Duke Xuan of Qi asked Mencius about the exchange between neighboring realms (交邻国).*\n*A great realm to a small realm is like the sea to rivers—*\n*when the great is lowly, the small will return to it.*\n*Thus, a great realm must practice humility well,*\n*then it can communicate with all small realms of the world.*\n*It is like the world’s intersection being receptive (牝)—*\n*The receptive ever conquers the assertive (牡) through stillness (静),*\n*The receptive is lowly through stillness—*\n*when a great realm is both humbly lowly and governs with stillness,*\n*like the receptive subduing the assertive through stillness,*\n*then the small realms will not need to be subdued by force but will return on their own.*\n*Thus, when a great realm humbles itself to a small realm, it takes the small realm.*\n*Only the virtuous can govern the great to serve the small—*\n*thus Tang served Ge, and King Wen served Kunyi.*\n*When a small realm humbles itself to a great realm, it takes the great realm.*\n*Only the wise can govern the small to serve the great—*\n*thus the Great King served the Xirong, and Goujian served Wu.\"*\n\n「Thus, when a realm humbles itself to take others, yet governs the great to serve the small, it is one who rejoices in the Dao/Way (乐天者).\nWhen a realm humbles itself and yet takes others, yet governs the small to serve the great, it is one who fears the Dao/Way (畏天者).\n\nA great realm seeks only to encompass and nourish (兼畜) all under heaven—\nthe one who rejoices in the Dao/Way preserves the world.\nA small realm seeks only to submit and serve others—\nthe one who fears the Dao/Way preserves its own land.\nBoth attain what they desire,\nexchanging mutual sustenance (交相养) and finding harmony (得其宜),\nlike mountains and valleys to grasses and trees (草木),\nwhen they do not sharply distinguish between the high and the low (不锐上丰下),\nthen they honor the roots while slighting the branches (则重本轻末).\nFor the great, when they dwell in humility (处下),\nthe small will find no realm they cannot bear and contain (容载).\nWhen the small flourish and spread their virtue (敷荣),\nthe great will find no realm that is not abundantly prosperous (富庶).\nThus, the great ought to dwell in humility (为下).\n\nWhen Confucius saw Laozi,\nand afterward Mencius emerged,\nwas there not one who gained wisdom from what they saw and heard?\nThe *Classics* say:\n*The Dao/Way is the hidden mystery (奥) of all things,*\n*a treasure for the virtuous (善人之宝),*\n*a safeguard for the unvirtuous (不善人之所保).*\n*Fine words can be used to trade (市),*\n*noble deeds can elevate a person (加人).*\n*Though people may be unvirtuous, why should they be abandoned?*\nThus, when establishing a Son of Heaven (天子) and appointing the Three Exalted Ministers (三公),\neven if one offers a jade tablet with four horses,\nit is not as valuable as simply sitting and imparting this Dao/Way.\nThis is why the ancients held this Dao/Way in such esteem—\nwas it not because seeking it brings reward (有所得),\nand possessing it exempts one from blame (有罪以免)?\n\nThus, it is the most precious for all under heaven.\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*The Dao/Way encompasses Heaven and Earth,*\n*concealing and nurturing all things,*\n*like a household’s inner chambers (阃奥).*\n*When the virtuous obtain it, they can make it a treasure for themselves.*\n*When the unvirtuous obtain it, they can make it a safeguard for themselves.*\n*Fine words can be used to trade,*\n*like Yao’s admonition to Shun: “Consider the matter well.”*\n*Noble deeds can elevate a person,*\n*as when you ascended to the imperial throne (汝陟帝位者).*\n*Fine words and noble deeds are the Dao/Way manifested externally (发于外者),*\n*yet even these can be used to trade and elevate—*\n*how much more so when the Dao/Way is preserved within!*\n*Though people may be unvirtuous, why should they be abandoned?*\n*The Book of Documents* says:\n*“To know people is wisdom (哲),*\n*to appoint them properly is governance (官人).*\n*To settle the people is benevolence (惠),*\n*and the common folk will cherish you (黎民怀之).”*\n*If one is wise and benevolent,*\n*why fear the treachery of Huan Dou (欢兜),*\n*why be exiled by the Youmiao (有苗),*\n*why dread the deceitful tongues and pleasing appearances of Gong Ren (孔壬)?*\n\n*Observe Yao’s words “Ah!” and “Alas!” (曰吁曰佛),*\n*and the wickedness of the Four Tyrants (四凶) was known*\n*even without Shun’s judgment.*\n*Yet, when their wickedness was proclaimed (声其不善),*\n*Yao did not immediately punish them (不即罪),*\n*which shows his imperial virtue (帝德) was broad and far-reaching,*\n*his benevolence as vast as Heaven (其仁如天),*\n*and he did not lightly take life (不轻杀戮).*\n\nThus, when establishing a Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Exalted Ministers,\nthe Son of Heaven acts as father and mother to the people (作民父母),\nthe Three Exalted Ministers discuss the Dao/Way and govern the realm (论道经邦),\nthey harmonize (燮) the principles of yin and yang,\nassist in the transformation and nurturing of all things (赞化育),\nsettle the people, and preserve the world.\n*The Book of Documents* says:\n*“Do not neglect the officials of the people (无旷庶官),*\n*for the work of Heaven, let man take its place (天工人其代之).”*\n*Beyond this, inspect the four directions (巡四岳),*\n*audience the feudal lords (朝诸侯),*\n*though one may have the honor of a jade tablet with four horses,*\n*or the splendor of a chariot with four horses,*\n*these are but external matters (外物),*\n*far less valuable than humbling oneself and facing south,*\n*sitting to impart this Dao/Way,*\n*and letting all under heaven govern itself (自治).*\n\nThis is why the ancients held this Dao/Way in such esteem—\nwas it not for this reason?\nIt is not merely that seeking it brings reward,\nand possessing it exempts one from blame.\nThus, it is the most precious for all under heaven.\n\nWhen the people are ignorant and misguided (昏垫),\nand unfortunately bear the guilt of wickedness (有不善之罪),\nthen the ruler laments and pities them, saying:\n*“I am the one who wronged them.”*\n*“Yea” (耶) is an uncertain word.*\n*This is not to condone their wickedness,*\n*but to recognize that those who carry out punishments (自有司杀者) exist.*\n*Thus, he holds the left contract (执左契) and does not blame the people,*\n*using this virtue of cherishing life (好生之德)*\n*to win the hearts of the people (洽于民心).*\n*If one were like Yao, they could be called*\n*the most precious for all under heaven and all ages.*\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*“To act without action (无为),*\n*to govern without governance (无事),*\n*to savor without savoring (无味).*\n*Great or small, many or few,*\n*repay resentment with virtue (报怨以德).*\n*Plan for difficulty in its ease (图难於其易),*\n*achieve greatness in its smallness (为大於其细).*\n*The most difficult matters in the world,*\n*must be begun in ease (必作於易).*\n*The greatest affairs in the world,*\n*must be begun in smallness (必作於细).*\n*Thus, the Sage never strives for the great,*\n*and so can achieve the great.*\n\n*He who makes light of promises,*\n*will be few in his trustworthiness (寡信).*\n*He who is prone to change,*\n*will encounter many difficulties (多难).*\n*Thus, the Sage still finds difficulty,*\n*and so never faces difficulty.*\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*The aged Sage (老圣) sighed at the corruption of the Dao/Way,*\n*that the clever and deceitful (智诈) deceived one another,*\n*leading to chaos (为乱),*\n*and there was no way to restore the hearts of the people (无以挽回人心).*\n*Thus, he expounded the ancient Way of non-action (敷迷上古无为之化),*\n*to instruct posterity (诏后世),*\n*to turn the shallow and deceptive (锲薄) winds of the age*\n*into the pure and thick (淳厚) qi of virtue,*\n*and to rely on the Dao/Way.*\n\n*Thus, to act without action is to follow nature (法自然).*\n*To govern without governance is to align with Heaven’s principles (顺天理).*\n*To savor without savoring is to delight in simplicity (乐恬淡).*\n*Great or small, many or few—*\n*all are contained within the relations of lord and subject, ruler and common folk (君臣民庶在焉).*\n*To repay resentment with virtue,*\n*when there is interaction between the high and the low (上下之交),*\n*if there is wickedness, then one should repay it with virtue as their heart.*\n*As it says: “I treat the good with goodness, and the wicked also with goodness.”*\n\n*Plan for difficulty in its ease,*\n*achieve greatness in its smallness—*\n*one’s schemes must be cautious from the beginning (谨始),*\n*and not allow difficulties to grow unchecked (无使滋蔓难图).*\n*The most difficult matters in the world,*\n*must be begun in ease (必作於易).*\n*The greatest affairs in the world,*\n*must be begun in smallness (必作於细).*\n*This is the principle of things (物理所在).*\n*From the subtle to the manifest (从微至着),*\n*like the easy reversals of the *I Ching* (易之不远复),*\n*without regret or remorse (无祇悔),*\n*from one yang to two yangs (一阳二阳),*\n*accumulating to become the *Qian* (乾).*\n*Thus, the Sage never strives for the great,*\n*and so can achieve the great.*\n\n*The Sage has the virtue of *Qian* (六阳之德),*\n*not making themselves great,*\n*yet achieving greatness.*\n\n*He who makes light of promises,*\n*will be few in his trustworthiness.*\n*He who is prone to change,*\n*will encounter many difficulties.*\n*The hearts of people are shallow and fickle (浇薄),*\n*often behaving thus.*\n*Few begin with good intentions,*\n*fewer still see them through (鲜克有终).*\n*Thus, the Sage finds difficulty in the beginning.*\n*The Sage’s heart,*\n*worries before the world’s worries (先天下之忧而忧),*\n*and rejoices after the world’s rejoicings (后天下之乐而乐).*\n*This is the one who has both beginning and end (有始有卒).*\n*Only because the Sage finds difficulty in the beginning,*\n*do they never face difficulty in the end.*\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*“Its stability is easy to maintain,*\n*its early signs are easy to plan against.*\n*Its fragility is easy to shatter,*\n*its subtlety is easy to disperse.”*\n\n「To act before things exist,\nAnd govern before chaos arises.\nA tree as thick as a man can embrace,\nGrows from a tiny sprout.\nA nine-tiered terrace,\nRises from a pile of earth.\nA journey of a thousand *li*,\nBegins beneath one’s feet.\n\nThe doer invites ruin,\nThe grasping one invites loss.\nThus, the Sage acts without doing—no ruin;\nHolds without grasping—no loss.\n\nThe people’s undertakings,\nOften falter as they near completion.\nTo guard the end as the beginning,\nThen no matter will fail.\n\nTherefore, the Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize hard-to-obtain goods.\nLearns without learning,\nReversing the errors of the multitude.\nTo aid the natural flourishing of all things,\nAnd dare not act.\n\n*The Original Meaning* says:\n*“Its stability is easy to maintain,”*\nThis follows the previous chapter’s intent,\nSpeaking of the principles of all things under Heaven.\nTo preserve their completion,\nOne must be cautious at their outset.\nIn times of peace and tranquility,\nGuard against reckless action—\nThen stability is easy to uphold.\nLike planning before a matter takes shape,\nBreaking what is brittle,\nDispersing what is subtle.\n\nTo act before things exist,\nIs not to force existence—\nThis is how to prevent ruin before it begins.\nTo govern before chaos arises,\nIs not to force order—\nThis is how to settle and restrain before disorder takes hold.\n\nThus, it is likened to a tree’s growth from a sprout,\nA terrace’s rise from a pile of earth,\nA journey’s start from one’s feet.\nAt their beginning, their signs are most faint,\nYet when they reach their end,\nThe tree is as thick as an embrace,\nThe terrace stands nine layers high,\nThe journey spans a thousand *li*.\n\nIs this not the work of many years?\nTheir beginnings must not be neglected.\n\nIn all matters under Heaven,\nOnce one’s heart turns to action,\nDefeat often follows.\nTo exert force and grasp,\nLoss and regret often ensue.\nWhat one undertakes with all one’s strength,\nWill later bring misfortune.\n\nThus, the Sage does without forcing—\nNo ruin in undertakings.\nDoes not cling to rigidity—\nNo loss or regret.\n\nThe common people are otherwise.\nTheir undertakings,\nOften falter as they near completion,\nFor they have not heard the Way of maintaining stability.\nTo guard the end as the beginning,\nThen no matter will fail—\nOnly the Sage can achieve this.\nTherefore, the Sage, like King Wen,\nHeld two-thirds of the realm under Heaven,\nYet served the Shang dynasty—\nThis shows their desire without desiring,\nTheir disregard for hard-to-obtain treasures.\n\nTo view the people as wounded,\nTo gaze upon the Dao yet not see it—\nThis shows their learning without learning,\nReversing the errors of the multitude.\n\nBut to aid the natural flourishing of all things,\nAnd dare not act—\nIn the end, this is simply non-action.\n\nThus it is said:\n“With King Ji as father,\nAnd King Wu as son,\nThe Sage without worries—\nIs this not King Wen?”\n\n*The Classics* say:\n“Ancient masters of the Dao,\nDid not enlighten the people,\nBut rather sought to befuddle them.\nThe people’s difficulty in governance,\nArises from their excess of cleverness.\nThus, to govern with cleverness,\nIs the thief of the state.\nTo govern without cleverness,\nIs the state’s blessing.\nKnowing these two truths,\nIs the model for governance.\nTo always know the model,\nIs called the Mysterious Virtue.\nThe Mysterious Virtue is profound and distant,\nOpposed to things—\nOnly then does one reach the Great Harmony.\n\n*The Original Meaning* says:\n“Ancient masters of the Dao,\nLike Yao’s governance of the world,\nWhere the people neither recognized nor knew—\nWas this not to enlighten them,\nBut rather to befuddle them?\n\nWhy so?\nThe ruler governed with non-action,\nLetting the people follow without knowing—\nThis was the state’s blessing.\nThe people’s difficulty in governance,\nCame from the ruler’s stimulation of their cleverness.\n\nMan possesses five natures,\nAll bestowed by Heaven,\nNone without natural principles,\nJust as Heaven has the Five Phases.\nSpring nurtures *ren*,\nSummer fosters *li*,\nAutumn fulfills *yi*,\nWinter conceals *zhi*,\nAnd *xin* flows through all four seasons.\nThus, the cold and heat regulate the seasons,\nAnd floods and droughts do not occur,\nDefects and diseases do not arise,\nAnd all things flourish.\n\nTo govern the people as if holding their fate,\nYet unaware of *ren*’s springing,\n*Li*’s growth,\n*Yi*’s fulfillment,\nAnd only valuing *zhi*’s concealment—\nThen the year is always winter,\nAnd all things are stored yet not born.\n\nCan this be called a year?\nA year of constant winter,\nAnd all things stored yet not born—\nGovernance that favors cleverness,\nIs only hoarding and not knowing release.\nCan this be called governance?\n\nIt is better to have thieving ministers\nThan ministers of hoarding.\nThus, to govern with cleverness,\nIs to rob one’s people,\nAnd thereby rob one’s state.\nTo govern without cleverness,\nIs to bless one’s people,\nAnd thereby bless one’s state.\nKnowing these two truths,\nIs the model for governance.\nTo always know the model,\nAnd not exalt cleverness—\nThen blessings extend to the state,\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nThe Mysterious Virtue,\nIs to aid the natural flourishing of things,\nAnd not to enlighten the people.\nThe Mysterious Virtue is profound and distant,\nOpposed to things—\nThis speaks of its difference from governance through cleverness.\nTo govern without cleverness,\nOnly then does one reach the Great Harmony.\nGreat Harmony means all things fulfill their nature of growth and completion.\n\n*The Classics* say:\n“Rivers and seas become kings of all valleys\nBecause they excel in yielding.\nThus, the Sage desires to be above others,\nBy speaking from below.\nTo be first among others,\nBy placing themselves last.\nThus, the Sage, though in high position,\nDoes not burden the people,\nThough in front,\nDoes not harm the people.\nThus, all under Heaven gladly follow,\nAnd never tire—\nBecause they do not contend,\nNo one under Heaven can contend with them.\n\n*The Original Meaning* says:\n“Rivers and seas become kings of all valleys\nBecause they excel in yielding.\nThis ties together the meaning of the previous chapters.\nRivers and seas excel in yielding,\nThus they become kings of all valleys.\nTherefore, the Sage follows the Way of yielding,\nAnd does not desire to be above others.\nYet, when necessity compels them to be above others,\nThey say:\n‘To desire to be above others,\nBy speaking from below.’\nThough in high position,\nTheir words remain humble.”\n\nThe Sage does not contend—\nIs this not the meaning of *humble reception and benefit*?\n\nThough their name may come first,\nTheir person follows behind.\nYet there are those who push forward and take precedence.\nOnly because they can yield and follow,\nThe Sage, though in high position, does not burden the people—\nNot because they seek to exalt themselves.\nThough in front, they do not harm the people—\nNot because they seek to obstruct others.\nOnly because they do not burden or harm,\nAll under Heaven gladly follow without tiring of their being above or first.\n\nWhy is this?\nBecause they do not contend with the people for high position or precedence,\nThus no one under Heaven can bear to contend with them.\n\n*The Mysterious Classic* states:\nWhen speaking of cultivating oneself,\nThe governance of family and state is included.\nWhen speaking of governing the state and family,\nCultivating oneself is included.\nThe wise observer will surely grasp the deeper meaning beyond the words.\n\n*The Classic* says:\nAll under Heaven say my Dao is vast yet seems unworthy.\nOnly because it is vast does it seem unworthy.\nIf it were worthy for long, it would be trifling.\nI possess three treasures; I guard and hold them:\nFirst, *compassion*;\nSecond, *frugality*;\nThird, *not daring to be first under Heaven*.\n\nCompassion makes one courageous.\nFrugality makes one abundant.\nNot daring to be first under Heaven makes one a vessel of excellence and leader.\n\nNow they abandon compassion and seek courage,\nAbandon frugality and seek abundance,\nAbandon yielding and seek precedence—\nThey are doomed.\n\nCompassion means victory in war and steadfastness in defense.\nHeaven aids them, shielding them with compassion.\n\n*The Original Meaning* says:\nThe Sage’s Dao is not the *Wuwei* of ancient antiquity,\nNor the harmonious Way of Tang and Yu.\nIts greatness is formless—\nIt cannot be sought through names or speech.\nFew common people recognize it,\nThus it is said: *All under Heaven say my Dao is vast yet seems unworthy.*\nMeaning it is beyond comparison.\n\nOnly because it is vast does it seem unworthy.\nIf it were worthy for long, it would be trifling—\nSelf-explanatory words, like saying:\n*Only Heaven is great; only Yao followed it—*\nWho could truly emulate it?\n\nAs for Yu’s leveling the earth and completing Heaven’s work,\nThat can be traced and followed.\n\nThe Sage laments that all under Heaven say my Dao is vast yet seems unworthy,\nSo he further explains the lesser aspects:\nI have three treasures; I guard and hold them.\nGuard and hold means to cherish and preserve them.\nFirst, *compassion*—not daring to slaughter Heaven’s people wantonly.\nSecond, *frugality*—not daring to waste Heaven’s resources recklessly.\nThird, *not daring to be first under Heaven*—not daring to initiate Heaven’s punishments.\n\nCompassion makes one courageous—\nReturning victorious, the troops dance with dry reeds, and the people rally.\nFrugality makes one abundant—\nWearing simple garments to honor the spirits,\nBuilding low halls to invest in canals and dikes.\nNot daring to be first under Heaven makes one a vessel of excellence and leader.\n\nShun appointed Zongzhen as his teacher, then promoted Gao Yao,\nSaying: *“Let me abdicate.”*\nThe ministers refused, so he yielded.\nThus, the ancients who practiced this were like Yu.\n\nNow they abandon compassion and seek courage—\nThus they slaughtered Long Fang and Bi Gan.\nAbandon frugality and seek abundance—\nThus they built tilted palaces of jade and yew,\nChambers of gemstone and pearl gates.\nAbandon yielding and seek precedence—\nThus they imprisoned Tang on the Southern Mound and at Youli,\nAnd met their doom at Nanhuo and Muyewild.\nThe ancients who practiced this were like Jie and Zhou.\n\nCompassion means victory in war—\nThe benevolent are invincible—\nAnd steadfastness in defense.\nThe people would die for them without hesitation.\nHeaven aids them, shielding them with compassion.\nThus they escaped the calamities of the Southern Mound and Youli.\nThe ancients who practiced this were like Tang and Wen.\n\nWhen Tang overthrew Jie, he said:\n*“In ancient Xia, the rulers and their successors flourished in virtue,\nAnd there were no Heavenly calamities.\nMountains, rivers, ghosts, and spirits—\nAll were at peace.\nEven birds, beasts, fish, and tortoises thrived.\nBut their descendants did not follow this.\nHeaven sent disaster,\nAnd entrusted it to me by decree.”*\n\nWhen Zhou attacked Zhou, they said:\n*“Only the wicked have no remorse.\nThey dwell in arrogance,\nDo not sacrifice to Heaven or the spirits,\nAnd abandon their ancestral temples.\nThe crimes of Shang are complete—\nHeaven’s mandate punishes them.”*\n\nThis is what is meant by *worthy*.\nTang and Wu could not be the rulers of Yao and Shun—\nTheir lesser status is clear.\n\n*The Classic* says:\nThe skilled warrior does not rely on force,\nThe skilled fighter does not rage,\nThe skilled victor does not contend,\nThe skilled leader serves below.\n\nThis is called the *virtue of non-contention*,\nThis is called the *power of using people*,\nThis is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—\nThe ultimate of the ancients.\n\n*The Original Meaning* says:\nThe ancients skilled in being a warrior did not rely on force—\nWas it not Wen Wang?\nImprisoned at Youli, he was betrayed by Chonghou Hu.\nWen Wang received the Mandate,\nAnd after six years, he attacked Chong.\nThe skilled fighter does not rage—\nChonghou Hu advised Zhou,\nWho offered the western lands of Luo and red-soil fields a thousand *li* to Zhou,\nAsked to abolish the *pao-lao* torture,\nAnd was granted bows, arrows, axes, and iron,\nThus gaining control over military campaigns as *Xiber*,\nOverseeing the southern states of Jiang, Han, and Ru,\nAnd the surrounding vassals.\n\nThe skilled victor does not contend—\nLü Shang, a man from the Eastern Sea,\nMet over seventy rulers without being heard,\nAnd people called him a madman.\nFishing at Weiyang,\nXiber labored and questioned him:\n*“Do you take pleasure in fishing?”*\nLü Shang replied:\n*“The noble takes pleasure in their aspirations,\nThe petty in their deeds.\nI fish not for pleasure.”*\nXiber spoke with him and was greatly delighted,\nSaying: *“My ancestor, Taigong, has long awaited you.”*\nThus he was called *Taigong Wang*,\nAnd appointed as teacher.\n\nThe skilled leader serves below—\nAs in the *Four Virtues* described above—\nThis is called the *virtue of non-contention*,\nThis is called the *power of using people*,\nThis is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—\nThe ultimate of the ancients.\n\n*Harmonizing with Heaven* means:\nIt is the ultimate standard for rulers.\n\nAs for the **Wen Wang**—he was indeed the finest exemplar of a scholar-official in antiquity, worthy of being a model for all under Heaven and future generations.\n\nIn days past, **Xī Bó** once asked **Taigong**,\n*“The Shang king’s crimes kill the innocent—will you aid me in my distress?”*\nTaigong replied:\n*“The Dao of Heaven brings no calamity—one must not act first.\nThe Dao of humanity brings no calamity—one must not plot first.”*\n\nAgain he asked:\n*“When a ruler’s actions and undertakings invite calamity or divine retribution, how does this manifest?”*\nTaigong said:\n*“Heavy taxation and lavish palaces bring widespread sickness and pestilence.\nFrost and dew destroy the five grains, and silk and hemp fail to mature.\nExcessive hunting and fowling, disregarding seasonal prohibitions, bring frequent great winds, and the grains bear no fruit.\nDesecrating sacred mountains and damming great rivers brings frequent great floods.\nPursuing warfare without cease brings eclipses of the sun and moon, and the White Star strays from its course.”*\n\n**Xī Bó** said, *“Truly so. Within no more than ten years, Shang perished, and all under Heaven turned to Zhou—this too is the proof of benevolent frugality and not acting first.”*\n\nThe **Classic** says:\n*“In war, there is a saying: I dare not be the aggressor, but only the defender.\nI dare not advance even an inch, but retreat a foot.\nThis is called *‘having no march’*—\n*‘no arms’*—*‘no enemy’*—*‘no weapons.’*\nNo greater calamity exists than contempt for the enemy—\ncontempt for the enemy nearly loses my treasure.”*\n\nThus, when armies clash, the one who first yields will win.\n\nThe **Original Meaning** says:\n*“Warfare is meant to guard against unforeseen threats, not to threaten all under Heaven.\nIn war, there is a saying—quoting ancient military doctrine, as follows:\nThe side that strikes first is the aggressor; the side that responds is the defender.\nI dare not be the aggressor, nor dare I strike first to threaten all under Heaven.\nBut if I am the defender, and the enemy does not provoke me, I must respond only when forced—this is guarding against the unforeseen.\nEven when forced to respond, I still dare not advance an inch to contempt the enemy;\nrather, I retreat a foot to fortify my defense.\nThis is called *‘having no march.’*\n*March* refers to leading an army—\n*‘no march’* means having no aggressive intent, though the army moves, it does not advance lightly.\n\n*‘No arms’*—*‘arms’* means defense—\n*‘no arms’* means having no intent to strike, though defending, one does not lightly raise a hand.\n\n*‘No enemy’*—*‘enemy’* means to provoke—\n*‘no enemy’* means having no intent to provoke, though engaging in battle, one does not lightly confront the enemy.\n\n*‘No weapons’*—*‘weapons’* are instruments of slaughter—\nThough wielding instruments of slaughter, one does not resort to killing.\nWhy? No greater calamity exists than contempt for the enemy.\n\nThe feudal lords treat their states as their hearts—\nthus, they cannot always avoid being the first to strike.\nThe Son of Heaven treats all under Heaven as his heart—\nthese are my people, those are also my people—\nharming them is harming myself.\nHow could I lightly contempt the enemy?\n\nThis is why **Yú** bowed to **Chang’s** words and recalled his armies,\nso that the **Miao people** submitted in peace.\n\nAlas, contempt for the enemy nearly loses my treasure—\n*‘treasure’* refers to the *three treasures* of the previous chapter:\nthe true treasure is virtue, and kindness and kinship are the treasures.\nThus, all under Heaven’s people are my treasures.\nTherefore, when armies clash, the compassionate will prevail.\nFor when two armies face each other, if one is moved by pity and spares life,\nthe hearts of the people will be revealed—\nwithout battle, their armies will yield, and victory is assured.”\n\nThis concludes the meaning of the two preceding chapters.\nThe previous chapter praised **Wen Wang** for his non-martial virtue,\nwhile subtly restraining the intent toward **Wū Wáng**.\n\nThe sages, both ancient and modern, often cite warfare,\ntaking **Yú’s** pacification of the **Miao** as their model.\n\nThe **Classic** says:\n*“My words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice.\nYet none under Heaven can know them,\nnone can practice them.\nWords have their roots, deeds have their lords.\nIt is only because of ignorance\nthat they do not know me.\nFew know me—\nthus, I am precious.\nTherefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.\nSome manuscripts read: *‘None know me.’*”*\n\nThe **Original Intent** states:\n*\"Words are the means to bear the Dao.\nKnowledge is knowing the Dao; practice is walking the Dao.\nVery easy to know, very easy to practice—\nI have no hidden meaning for you.\nTo walk it is to find harmony on all sides,\nYet none under Heaven can know or practice it—\nAh, what a lament!\nWords have their roots, deeds have their lords.\nWords with roots are all drawn from the ancient texts of *Fen* and *Dian*,\nAnd deeds with lords are all grounded in the Emperor’s Way.\nHow could this be mere empty speech?\nTo not know words is to not know the Dao—\nThus, they do not know me.\nSince they cannot know, nor can they practice,\nTheir lack of knowledge is evident.\nOnly because of ignorance\nAre those who know me few—\nThis is not surprising.\nAlas, few know me,\nSo I am precious—\nOr as some say, *‘the law.’*\nMy Dao is taken from the Dao,\nThus I am precious.\n\nThe **Original Intent** says:\nKnowledge is knowing the Dao;\nIgnorance is not knowing the Dao.\nTo know while not speaking is exalted;\nTo speak while not knowing is folly.\nOnly those who scorn folly\nDo so because they are not folly.\nThe sage is not folly,\nBecause the sage scorns folly—\nThus, the sage is not folly.\n*(The Classic says: To know while not speaking is exalted;\nTo speak while not knowing is folly.\nOnly those who scorn folly\nDo so because they are not folly.\nThe sage is not folly,\nBecause the sage scorns folly—\nThus, the sage is not folly.)*\nThe **Original Intent** says:\nThe sage knows without error, acts without error—\nWho would regret this?\n\nIn ancient Zhou, there stood a bronze man,\nWith three sealed mouths and inscriptions on his back.\nWhen the sage was in Zhou,\nSurely the bronze man was made—\nYet Confucius, upon seeing Zhou,\nHad once been deceived by touching it.\nThe previous chapter said:\n‘Very easy to know, very easy to practice—\nYet none under Heaven can know or practice it.’\nThis chapter speaks of:\n‘To know while not speaking is exalted;\nTo speak while not knowing is folly.’\nDoes the Dao truly remain unknowable forever?\nTo know is to know, to not know is to not know—\nThis is knowing.\n\nThe **Classic** says:\n*\"If the people do not fear punishment,\nThen the greatest punishment has arrived.\nDo not narrow their dwelling,\nDo not weary their birth.\nOnly because of not wearying\nIs it that they do not weary me.\nThus, the sage knows himself but does not reveal himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself—\nHence, he discards that and takes this.\"*\n\nThe **Original Intent** says:\nPunishment is the law.\nThe people value their bodies,\nYet when punishment is added—\nWho does not know to fear?\nYet there are those who disregard the axe and the blade,\nAnd transgress against it—\nWhy?\nBecause the greatest punishment has arrived.\nThey know they have no escape,\nAnd even the lowly fear suffering—\nHow much more those of great strength!\nTang left Xia’s net of three sides—\nThis was well-founded.\nThe southern lords of Han heard it say:\n‘Tang’s virtue extended even to birds and beasts—\nForty states submitted to him.’\nAlas, Jie was a ruler,\nTang was a subject.\nTo comfort me is to be my successor,\nTo oppress me is to be my enemy—\nThe heart of the great man,\nHow could it be narrow?\nIf narrow, then there are things it cannot contain,\nAnd it monopolizes blessings and imposes punishments—\nReaching everywhere, none can endure.\nIf the people cannot endure,\nThen subjects kill their rulers,\nSons kill their fathers—\nSurely there are those it cannot contain.\nThis is why Jie perished\nAnd Tang rose.\nDo not narrow their dwelling—\nTheir dwelling is the heart.\nA heart not narrow is where spirit and clarity reside,\nAnd all things are contained within the Way of life.\nDo not weary their birth—\nTheir birth is both inner spirit and clarity,\nAnd outer people and things—\nAll must not be weary.\nIf weary, then the heart will abandon me—\nThis is the Way of life and death.\nOnly because of not wearying\nDo I not weary them.\nThus, they do not weary me.\nThe sage knows himself but does not reveal himself—\nWithout the heart of arrogating others.\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself—\nWithout the heart of threatening others.\nHence, he discards that narrowness and weariness,\nAnd takes this knowing and loving.\"*\n\nThe **Classic** says:\n*\"Courageous in daring brings death,\nCourageous in not daring brings life.\nThese two paths—\nOne brings benefit, one brings harm.\nWhat the heavens abhor,\nWho knows their cause?\nThus, even the sage finds it difficult.\nThe Way of Heaven\nConquers without strife,\nResponds without words,\nSummons without calling.\nIt is tranquil yet ever-planning.\nThe Heavenly net is vast and wide,\nThough sparse, it does not lose a single thread.\"*\n\nThe **Original Intent** says:\nCourage is resolve;\nDaring is *qi*.\nResolve reaches its end,\n*Qi* follows next.\nTo hold resolve without unleashing *qi* is the Way of life.\nIf *qi* is one, then it moves;\nIf resolve moves and *qi* strays—\nThen it is the Way of stumbling and death.\nTo know these two paths—\nOne brings benefit, one brings harm,\nFor resolve and *qi* are two things—\nIf their Way is mastered, then benefit.\nIf their Way is lost, then harm.\nWhat the heavens abhor,\nWho knows their cause?\nThis is the origin of abhorrence.\nThe heavens love life and abhor death—\nWho can know the heavenly intent to abhor death\nAnd not defy it?\nThus, even the sage finds it difficult.\nThe heavenly intent is unfathomable,\nYet the sage still considers it difficult,\nAnd does not act with daring courage.\nThe Way of Heaven\nConquers without strife—\nSoftness overcomes hardness.\nResponds without words—\nSincerity moves the spirit.\n\nThe Way does not summon yet comes of its own accord—\nWhen one does good, a hundred blessings descend;\nWhen one does evil, a hundred calamities descend.\n\nThus, when one is cautious yet skillful in counsel,\nThe Dao of Heaven rewards virtue and punishes licentiousness.\n\nThe Heavenly Net is vast and open,\nYet nothing escapes its grasp.\n\nHeaven’s will is inscrutable,\nLife’s decree is not constant—\nIf one’s virtue is constant,\nOne preserves one’s station.\nIf virtue is not constant,\nThe Nine Realms bring ruin.\n\nFor calamity and blessing have no gate—\nOnly the self invites them.\n\nWhen Jie and Zhou ruled as tyrants,\nHad they but appointed the worthy and heeded counsel,\nKnown Heaven’s abhorrence,\nAnd not acted with reckless daring,\nEven though they were cautious—\nHow could the sages Shang and Wu dare not submit?\n\nAlas, how dire!\nWas it not that Jie and Zhou brought ruin upon themselves?\nOr was it the Heavenly Net’s vastness that never fails?\n\nHow the sage’s words cannot be defied!\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The people do not fear death—\nHow can you frighten them with death?\"*\n\nIf one makes death a constant terror,\nAnd those who act strangely are seized and killed—\nWho would dare?\n\nOnly the proper officers should kill.\nTo usurp the role of the executioner\nIs to usurp the place of the master carpenter in his craft.\nTo usurp the master carpenter’s chisel—\nFew escape uninjured hands.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*\"To cherish life and abhor death—\nThis is the common heart of all.\"*\n\nThe people do not fear death—\nHow can you frighten them with death?\n\nThis follows the previous chapter’s intent,\nLamenting that the Way of the King is not in action—\nWhen the people do not die by war,\nThey die by famine—\nWho kills them?\n\nYet laws are made strict,\nTaxes and levies are multiplied,\nThe people are coerced by threats,\nDriven to their deaths with no escape—\nNot that they do not fear death,\nBut that they cannot avoid it.\n\nMencius said:\n*\"To kill with the blade or with governance—\nThis is the same intent.\"*\n\nIf the people do not fear death,\nIt means they cannot endure life,\nAnd harbor a heart of equal indifference to death.\n\nIf the ruler relaxes laws,\nLightens taxes and labor,\nReduces burdens—\nThen the people, each nourished in their place,\nWould fear strange actions and unrest.\n\nIf the people are properly nourished,\nYet some still cause unrest—\nSeize them and kill them as proper officers,\nPlace them under punishment—\nThis is Heaven’s killing.\n\nWho dares say the people always fear death,\nAnd dare not transgress?\n\nThe proper executioner is Heaven.\nTo usurp Heaven’s killing is to act as man.\nTo kill rightly is Heaven’s killing;\nTo kill wrongly is to kill as man—\nHow could it not injure?\n\nLike the master carpenter’s craft—\nTo usurp the master’s chisel,\nFew escape uninjured hands.\nThis illustrates killing by governance—\nTruly, it is self-injury.\n\nWhen the Zhou Dynasty moved east,\nAuthority fell to the feudal lords,\nWho unilaterally waged war—\nLike usurping the master’s chisel,\nNot only did the proper order collapse,\nBut the armies of the feudal lords,\nRavaging a thousand *li*,\nSlaughtered the people—\nThey had no time to fear death.\n\nWhen Heaven’s decree overcame man,\nFew did not fail—\nThis is the meaning of injury to the hands.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxes—\nThus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty to govern comes from their rulers’ interference—\nThus they are difficult to govern.\nThe people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ excessive pursuit of life—\nThus they treat death lightly.\"*\n\nOnly those who do not cling to life\nAre wiser than those who prize it.\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*\"The state depends on the people as its root,\nThe people depend on food as their heaven.\nA state cannot exist without the people,\nJust as the people cannot exist without food.\nThe people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxes—\nThus they hunger.\nIn the late periods of the Three Dynasties,\nThe great granaries were alike.\nOnce, the Five Hegemons contended for power,\nImposing labor and warfare,\nUnequal rewards and burdens,\nScarce state resources,\nFields left uncultivated,\nTaxes uncollected—\nAnd yet they increased levies.\nThis is why the people starved.\nWhen starving, they stole and schemed without restraint—\nThus they were difficult to govern.\nNot that the people were difficult to govern,\nBut because their rulers acted.\nWhen rulers act, the people act in turn.\nThe people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ excessive pursuit of life.\nThose who exhaust a nation’s people\nTo nourish their ears, eyes, noses, and mouths—\nTheir spirits do not permit it.\nTheir spirits not permitted,\nThus they treat death lightly.\nOnly those who do not cling to life\nAre wiser than those who prize it.\nWhy?\nBecause nourishing life must first be rooted in substance—\nYet even with abundance, many fail to nourish themselves.\nIf the laws of a declining age are followed,\nEven the sages would not adopt them.\"*\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"When a person is born, they are soft and weak;\nWhen they die, they become stiff and strong.\nAll things, grass and trees—\nWhen they are born, they are soft and fragile;\nWhen they die, they wither and decay.\nThus, the stiff and strong are the companions of death,\nThe soft and weak are the companions of life—\nHence, strong armies do not conquer,\nStrong trees are easily split.\nThe strong and great are beneath,\nThe soft and weak are above.\"*\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*\"Death and life are profound.\nThe companions of life, the companions of death—\nI have already spoken of their essence in *Entering and Exiting Death*.\nAlas, when a person is born, they are soft and weak—\nThe soft and weak are the companions of life.\nWhen they die, they become stiff and strong—\nThe stiff and strong are the companions of death.\nIs it only for humans?\nAll things are the same.\nThus it is also said:\nAll things, grass and trees—\nWhen they are born, they are soft and fragile;\nWhen they die, they wither and decay.\nTrace their origin in life and death—\nIt lies in the two *qi* of yin and yang.\nThe two *qi* originate from the One *Qi* of the Supreme Polarity,\nThe One *Qi* originates from the Boundless Void of the Great Emptiness.\nThe *Classic* says:\n*The myriad things under Heaven are born from Being,\nBeing is born from Non-Being.*\nIn the *Yijing*, it says:\n*The Great Polarity is born from the *Yi*,\nFrom which the Two Complements arise.*\nThe *Yi* is without yet reaches the utmost of Being—\nTo know the *Yi* is without yet reaches the utmost of Being,\nIs to know the *Yi* is Boundless.\nThe *Yi* has the Great Polarity—\nHow could it not be called Boundless and the Great Polarity?\nThe Great Polarity is the undifferentiated *qi* at the origin of things,\nThe Boundless is the formless Great Emptiness before the Great Polarity.\nThe Buddhist school says:\n*All dharmas return to One,\nOne returns to where?*\nIt is also the saying:\nBeing is born from Non-Being,\nAnd again returns to Non-Being.\"*\n\nThus, what is the role of those who follow life, and what of those who follow death? From the Great Polarity arise the Two Complements—*Qian* the firm, *Kun* the yielding—heaven and earth uniting in virtue.\n\n*Qian* is heaven. Heaven’s One generates water: the father is firm, the child yielding, so water’s nature is soft and weak, its virtue to follow downward. Earth’s Two generates fire: the mother is yielding, the child firm, so fire’s nature is flaming upward, its virtue dry and hard.\n\nWere it not for fire’s firmness, *Qian*’s vigorous body would not manifest. Were it not for water’s yielding, *Kun*’s accommodating function would not be fulfilled. Only through the interplay of firm and yielding does the enduring and vast virtue emerge.\n\nIn birth, the human is soft and weak—heaven’s water sustains it. In death, it becomes rigid and strong—earth’s fire reclaims it. Only when firm and yielding balance does the work of life and death complete itself, and thus the Dao of longevity and enduring vision lies within. Hence, the nurturers of life take this as their law.\n\nThe yielding and weak give life; the firm and strong bring death. Just as a strong army cannot prevail—it is attacked by many—so too a rigid tree is felled by many axes. The firm and great are lowly; the yielding and weak are exalted. This is the Way of Heaven.\n\nThe sages and the old masters say: yielding and weak preserve *qi*; firm and strong deplete the body. When *qi* is harmonious, life flourishes; when the body is robust, aging comes. Aging leads to death, and death must return to its source. To return to the infant state, to return to the Boundless—this is the Way of return.\n\nThe *Classic* says: The Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow. The high are lowered; the low are raised. The excessive are diminished; the deficient are supplemented. Heaven’s Way is to diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient. But the Way of humanity is otherwise: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. Who can serve the world with its excess? Only the Daoist.\n\nThus the sage acts without relying on it, achieves without claiming it, and does not seek to be seen as virtuous.\n\n*The Original Meaning* says: In the *Hongfan*, the ninth category is *Huangji* (the Sovereign Polarity). The Sovereign establishes the Polarity, speaking of the central Way standing firm, its central path encompassing the nine categories.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow. Using the analogy of drawing and releasing, the high are lowered, the low are raised—this is seen in the balance of high and low. The excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented—this is seen in the balance of great and small.\n\nEarth’s *qi* ascends; heaven’s *qi* descends—this is the Way of lowering the high and raising the low. Extreme heat turns to cold; extreme cold turns to warmth—this is the Way of diminishing the excessive and supplementing the deficient. The Way of Heaven thus bends toward the middle, achieving harmony and establishing the positions of heaven and earth, nurturing all things.\n\nBut the Way of nurturing humanity is otherwise: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. Heaven’s nature and human desires are ever in opposition. The so-called gentleman practices the Mean; the petty man rejects it. Who can serve the world with its excess, as heaven’s clouds move and rain nourishes all things? Only the Daoist—this is the saying: *Virtue lies in good governance; governance lies in nurturing the people.*\n\nThe sage acts without presumption, expecting no reward. When the work is done, he does not dwell on it—this is the Way of Heaven. He does not seek to be seen as virtuous; he simply holds to the Mean.\n\nThe sage’s deeds are both action and non-action, encompassing heaven and earth. The common people do not recognize this.\n\nAh! The heavens’ burden is without sound or scent.\n\nThe *Classic* says: Under Heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than water. Yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the firm and strong. There is no substitute for it. Thus, the yielding overcomes the firm; the weak overcomes the strong. All know this, yet none can practice it.\n\nHence the sage says: To bear the nation’s impurities is to be its sovereign. To bear the nation’s misfortunes is to be its king. His words seem inverted.\n\n*The Original Meaning* says: Softness overcomes hardness; the female overcomes the male—this is the principle. No thing is softer and weaker than water, yet when it reaches its fullness, it breaches dams and floods rivers, and none can resist it.\n\nThe old sages pitied the decline of the Xia and Shang dynasties, fearing the rise of a second age of decline. Thus, through the question of Guan Yin, they admonished and rescued them, saying: All know this, yet none can practice it. Only Lord Yu attained it, using water to control water, leveling the earth so heaven’s order was fulfilled. King Tang attained it, conquering east and west, ever fearful of falling behind. The Western King attained it, subduing the barbarians and punishing the arrogant, yet none dared to rebel.\n\nIs this not the very essence of how the soft overcomes the hard? Had Jie understood this, he might have governed like the sage-kings Yu and Tang, and never would Tang have conquered him. Had Zhou understood this, he might have learned from the fall of Xia, and never would Wu have overthrown him. But because of their rigid cruelty and stubborn ignorance, there arose ministers who usurped their thrones—how dire the consequence!\n\nThus the sages declared: To bear a nation’s calamities is to be its sovereign. To bear a nation’s misfortunes is to be its king over all. These are the words of the ancient sages. When Gun was drowned, when Tang and Wen were imprisoned, none suffered greater calamities than they. Yet when Yu received the Mandate of Heaven through abdication, when Tang and Wu seized power themselves, they became sovereigns and kings over all.\n\nAlas! Jie and Zhou were indeed tyrants as rulers, while Tang and Wu were indeed sages as subjects. If Yu, through merit, received the Mandate peacefully, then no reproach attaches. But if Tang and Wu, through cunning and force, took the throne themselves, how could they avoid shame? Only King Wen, with his utmost reverence toward Zhou, never straying from propriety, could be compared in virtue to Yao and Shun.\n\nThe true intent of *The Mysterious Classic* is to admonish rulers: Rectify yourself, and you rectify the people. Rectify the people, and the realm’s order is fulfilled. How could a subject ever presume to replace his sovereign?\n\nThe proper relationship between ruler and subject: I, the people of the Yellow Emperor’s age, were unshackled by laws yet content with our food—coarse grains to eat, hollowed gourds to drink from, simple garments to wear, fur to ward off cold, and shelters of nests and caves to shield us from wind and rain. We took joy in our customs, cradling our infants and patting our bellies in contentment. Neighboring lands lay in sight, yet our paths never clashed. The sounds of roosters and dogs reached one another, yet all things flourished without harm. The people lived to old age without seeking one another’s company, knowing no desire to contest cities or lands. Heaven’s Way and Earth’s bounty were never wanting.\n\nTo ponder this passage: the ancient simplicity and purity still resonates through heaven and earth—just as it was then, so it remains now. Thus we know the sages’ wisdom was beyond the grasp of later-age tyrants.\n\nWhat they called a \"great sage encountered once in ten thousand years\" is one whose understanding dawns as naturally as day follows night.\n\n*The Classic* says:\n*\"Faithful words lack beauty; beautiful words lack truth.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue lack virtue.\nThe wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\nThe sage does not hoard.\nThe more one gives to others, the more one possesses.\nThe more one shares with others, the more one has.\nHeaven’s Way benefits without harming.\nThe sage’s Way acts without contention.\"*\n\n*The Original Meaning* says:\nThe sage’s heart is the heart of heaven and earth—boundless in acceptance, boundless in giving. Like water poured in but never full, drawn upon but never exhausted.\n\nBut common people are otherwise:\nBeautiful words lack truth, for they prize ornamentation.\nFaithful words lack beauty, for the Way values simplicity.\nThe virtuous do not argue, for they embrace all without reservation.\nThose who argue lack virtue, for they cling to words.\nThe wise are not learned, for they merge into oneness.\nThe learned are not wise, for they count without measure.\nThe sage does not hoard, for they align with the ebb and flow of time.\nThe more one gives to others, the more one possesses—\nfor the heart of nurturing life is ever-present.\nThe more one shares with others, the more one has—\nfor the heart of creation is inexhaustible.\nHeaven’s Way benefits without harming.\nHeaven’s lack of favor is itself the greatest favor.\nThe original intent of *The Mysterious Classic on Dao and Virtue* concludes here.",

      "translated_text": "**The Original Purport of the Mysterious Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue**\n\n**Title:** *The Original Purport of the Mysterious Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* (also known as *The Original Purport of the Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, *The Original Purport of Laozi*, or *The Original Purport of the Mysterious Classic*). Composed by Du Daojian of the Yuan dynasty. Four juan. Prefaces by Li Liwu, Zhang Yucai, Mou Yan, Xu Tianyu, and others.\n\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* section, *Jade Instructions* category.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to *The Original Purport of the Mysterious Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***\n\nThe *Laozi* and the *Yijing* share the same Dao. The *Yijing* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate, yet the sacred scripture leaves it unelaborated. Its opening with *Qian* and *Kun* pertains to the Dao of the Posterior Heaven—modeled after heaven and earth, thus aligning the Confucian and Daoist paths with the workings of heaven and earth. The Supreme Change (*Taiyi*), unseen even in qi, is regarded by Daoists as the ancestor of the Great Dao, the nameless origin of heaven and earth, the Dao of the Prior Heaven. The Dao follows spontaneity, and thus the sage of old attained the wondrous return to nothingness. Alas! The entire *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* is contained herein.\n\nI have long held that the supreme Dao is not cumbersome, and so I once expressed it through diagrams and eulogies without daring to exhaust its meaning. One day, my nephew Jiancheng Xing arrived from Hangzhou and told me that he had recently met Master Du of Nangu. Their discussions often aligned with my diagrams and eulogies, and so he obtained Master Du’s work, *The Original Purport*. Upon reading it, I sighed that no one in this world had ever discussed these matters with such resonance—every word struck a chord within. It speaks of the mysterious as seemingly nonexistent, yet existence itself is again mysterious, seemingly existent yet nonexistent, the heaven that gives birth to all things. From this great revelation, the heaven of spontaneity endures, hidden yet ever-present.\n\nIt states: \"Within the emptiness of the Supreme Ultimate dwells the Valley Spirit.\" The valley’s emptiness, responsive and good, is the heart; the spirit’s stillness, numinous and true, is nature. It declares: \"The Supreme Ultimate is the primordial undifferentiated Great One; the Limitless is the formless Great Void before the Supreme Ultimate.\" It further says: \"Of the ten aspects of the Dao as a thing, the Supreme Ultimate is one.\" All these are profound discourses. As the saying goes, \"Build a cart behind closed doors, and it will match the tracks when taken out\"—truly so!\n\nIf one encounters a work like this, the causes and effects of past and present become instantly clear. Within the five thousand words of the *Laozi*, its principles are thoroughly expounded and elucidated, confirming that this is no empty rhetoric. Lord Lao’s Dao extends beyond the earliest beginnings; his spirit roams the boundless ancient past. He lived through the late Zhou dynasty, witnessing all the changes under heaven. To leave teachings for ten thousand generations—what benevolence and righteousness could surpass this? Yet some criticize it without reflection.\n\nGenerally, the Dao and its virtue are spoken of in terms of the Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate, while benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust are expressed through yin-yang and the Five Phases. The sage’s treatment of heaven, earth, and the myriad things as straw dogs is deemed \"without benevolence,\" yet this aligns with the Six Classics’ nurturing of benevolence. Consider the discussions on \"supreme virtue and supreme benevolence,\" \"losing the Dao and losing virtue,\" \"rejecting benevolence and abandoning wisdom\"—these describe the progression from the August to the Emperor, from the Emperor to the King. The Dao rises and falls, while the hegemons usurp benevolence, steal righteousness, and falsify propriety through cunning. *The Original Purport* truly grasps this meaning.\n\nMoreover, it states that the Dao governs the fate of the people, unaware of the life-giving power of benevolence, the growth fostered by propriety, the completion brought by righteousness—only the concealment of wisdom is esteemed. This is like a year without spring, summer, or autumn, perpetually in winter. How profound!\n\nAlas! The flow of the heavenly Dao and the shifts of the worldly Dao, once gone, do not return—such is the inevitable trend. To adapt and preserve them lies with humanity, and thus this classic was composed. It says: \"Its essence is most true; within it lies sincerity.\" The sincerity of the Five Constants is the earth of the Five Phases; the Dao of the Prior Heaven’s Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate cannot be altered by ten thousand changes—this is what is called *cheng* (integrity). Having gathered the essential purport of the classic to cultivate nature and conduct, I append it at the end of the scroll.\n\nWritten by Li Liwu of Xigu, on the Shangyuan Festival of the *yisi* year of the Dade era.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface by Zhang Yucai**\n\nThe eighty-one chapters of the *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* have been annotated by over three thousand scholars. Master Du of Nangu’s *Original Purport* begins with \"The Purport of the Mysterious Classic,\" primarily addressed to rulers. It further states that the sage Lao composed the *Mysterious Classic* to elucidate the august Dao and the imperial virtue. Its grand principles and essential themes are made clear from the very first scroll.\n\nIn this world, the classic, when unfolded, fills the six directions; when rolled up, it enters the tiniest speck of dust. Its essence cannot be confined to one corner. *The Original Purport* grasps its greatness, and thus its lesser aspects cannot contradict it.\n\nI have heard that Master Du of Nangu once accompanied Dongming in an imperial audience. Though he harbored earnest intentions, he did not have the chance to present this work. Perhaps his lifelong aspirations could not be expressed in his time, so he entrusted them to later generations. Those who obtain this work will achieve governance surpassing even that of Emperor Wen of Han. Master Du is truly extraordinary!\n\nWritten by Zhang Yucai, Inheritor of the Heavenly Master, on the Minor Snow of the *yisi* year of the Dade era.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface by Mou Yan**\n\nIn the cramped and dusty world, my heart is often troubled, and conversing with ordinary people brings no joy. When Master Du of Nangu arrived by boat, our discussions were transcendent, lifting my spirits. Together, we ascended the Cloud Peak of the Daoist sanctuary and lodged there. At midnight, by the light of a flickering lamp, he showed me his *Original Purport of Laozi*. I read through the night until dawn.\n\nMaster Du has studied extensively across all texts, and his work does more than merely elucidate the classic’s essential purport. On one chapter, he remarked, \"This pertains to the affairs of Yao and Shun.\" On another, he said, \"This concerns the deeds of Yu, King Wen, and King Wu.\" His interpretation treats Laozi as the Archivist of the Zhou, whose duty was to record history—and the hundred-chapter book is also history. Thus, he approached it through historical inquiry, which astonished me.\n\nEver since Sima Qian placed Laozi and Han Fei in the same biography, dissatisfaction has lingered for a thousand years. He Shanggong’s commentary on the *Laozi* frequently touches on breathing exercises and guiding-and-pulling techniques. Later, scholars like Sun Deng, Tao Hongjing, the Immortal of Pine Spirit, the Tang Daoist Cheng Xuanying, and Zhang Junxiang also annotated the *Laozi*. More recently, the immortalist Wang Fusi used the *Laozi* to interpret the *Yijing*, which some criticized. Yet his interpretation of the *Laozi* itself made no reference to the *Yijing*.",

      "translated_text": "To Su Ziyou, who directly regarded it as an inheritance of enlightenment, a transmission of the lamp of the Śākya clan—how could the *Laozi* have foreseen that its later currents would reach such a state? Now, Master Du seeks it through the books of emperors and kings, cross-referencing it with their deeds. It is as if one emerges from darkness into light, from obscurity into grandeur, where the atmosphere and vision suddenly transform—how could this not be most fitting? Some say this is merely his *Origins of the Dao* commentary.\n\nAlas, the world has yet to discern Master Du’s true intent. For long has the Way been fragmented, each clinging to their own biases, vying to establish sects, even preserving remnants and guarding gaps to disparage others. None are willing to set aside their prejudices and seek the convergence of truth. Though Master Du titles his work *Original Purport*, he does not adhere to a single school. He harmonizes only with principle, follows only the classics, and venerates only what is correct, striving to leave no room for doubt in later generations regarding his master’s teachings. Such is his intent—truly magnanimous. How could it fundamentally differ from the *Origins of the Dao*?\n\nI, being of limited understanding, have not deeply examined the *Original Purport*, but I shall briefly discuss its general meaning.\n\nScholars of the Laozi’s teachings invariably favor Laozi over Confucius. The followers of Liezi and Zhuangzi go so far as to exalt their masters by disparaging Yao, Shun, and Confucius, using them as foils. Thus, Confucians label them as heterodox, and the teachings of Confucius and Laozi diverge into two paths. Yet the Laozi’s teachings were not inherently at odds with Confucianism. Its Way transcends being to function in non-being, gathering emptiness to transform the substantial, directly aiming to replace sagely wisdom and benevolence with a world of plain simplicity. Confucians often recoil at its radical renunciations, but how could they know whether such words are feigned or genuine?\n\nWhen its principles are applied well, the Western Han governed through tranquility. When followed poorly to the extreme, the Western Jin perished through vacuity. Must one abandon all restraints and standards to claim it differs from what I call the Way?\n\nMaster Du of Nangu, in his study of this teaching, does not interpret the Laozi’s text through Daoist doctrines. Instead, he draws from Confucianism to illuminate it. Through meticulous analysis of chapters and phrases, he ensures coherence without fragmentation, preferring not to dissect it piecemeal. By drawing analogies and comparing meanings, he fully incorporates the Way of the Five Emperors, the Three Kings, and the teachings of Confucius and Mencius into his explanations. It is like the five colors adapting to their subjects, blending harmoniously into brilliance; like the five notes, high and low, clear and deep, resonating to form a perfect melody; like thirty spokes converging at a single hub, each taking different paths east and west, yet ultimately aligning in their tracks. In my view, his work achieves unity.\n\nThe Laozi’s teachings aspire to restore the governance of knotted cords—a practice of Fuxi and Shen Nong from the distant past. Its discourse on the Valley Spirit traces back to the Yellow Emperor; its esteem for non-action resembles Shun; its valuing of humility and lack of boasting mirrors Yu. Countless subtle words and profound meanings align with the Six Classics. Observing the convergence of all schools, to claim Confucius and Laozi do not belong to the same tradition—I do not believe it.\n\nMaster Du, as one who has heard the Dao and progressed from subtlety to wonder, harmonizing differences into unity, embodies what Sima Qian called the Daoist spirit: single-minded, yet incorporating the strengths of Confucianism. Is this not so?\n\nIn my youth, when I first took office in Wuxing, I once drifted along Fengxi. Now, in old age, one day Master Du sent a letter through a mutual friend, presenting me with his *Original Purport*. Though I have not fully grasped its meaning, I privately admire his exhaustive and erudite synthesis.\n\nReaders should examine it in detail for themselves.\n\nWritten by the remnant subject Xu Tianyu, courtesy name Siwanfu, at Yichu Mountain Studio.\n\nI recall Sima Qian’s record of the Western Capital during the reign of Emperor Wen of Han, when the people lived in joy, and elders of sixty or seventy played like children. The prosperity of that golden age can still be imagined. Was this not the result of studying the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s teachings of tranquility? Yet the Han is not our only evidence.\n\nThe essence of the Laozi’s text lies in non-action and non-contention. These were the practices of the ancient sage-kings, which even Tang and Wu found difficult to uphold. As the Zhou declined, a purple aura crossed the pass westward. Moved by the times, Laozi composed his five thousand words, then departed, concealing his intent and deepening his hopes for the age. Once the text spread, it naturally found adherents. Yet its scholars—whether wielding the harsh techniques of Legalism or the abstruse theories of immortality—failed to mutually illuminate, instead turning to mutual criticism. Moreover, with hundreds of commentaries, few have truly grasped the original meaning of the classic.\n\nMaster Du of Nangu’s *Original Purport*, the last to emerge, decisively declares: This is my master’s exploration of ancient history, expounding the Way of Fuxi, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun. As Laozi served as the Archivist of the Zhou, the past was not distant, and the governance of \"wearing robes and knotting cords\" remained vividly before his eyes. No record is more trustworthy than history. To verify it through ancient history and make it easily credible—this truly begins with Master Du.\n\nBan Gu described Daoists as \"vacuous and self-contained,\" aligning with Yao’s abdication, yet overlooking the ruler’s role. His *Treatise on the Nine Schools* separates Confucianism from Daoism, tracing the Dao’s origin to the Heavenly Sage. Yet the Sage’s transmission—nameless, designated only as the Dao—was later monopolized as a school. Was this truly Laozi’s intent? If his teachings were applied today, they would purely return to the ancient Way of Confucius, offering great assistance.\n\nMaster Du, hailing from the Confucian tradition yet studying the Laozi’s teachings, does not favor one over the other but reconciles both. How admirable! Though I am dull and have not fully grasped his intent, I hope one day to retreat to the mountains, sharing a patch of land beneath the white clouds, to resolve doubts and clarify uncertainties—perhaps gaining insight beyond mere words and texts.\n\nWritten by Wang Yijian, courtesy name Lidefu, of Shanyin.\n\n*Original Purport of the Mysterious Classic of Dao and Virtue*, Volume One\nAnnotated by Du Daojian, Eminent Scholar of the Daoist Teachings of Dangtu",

Distinctions in virtue are made, and praise or censure is implied—scholars must view this with the eyes of the ancients, observing the era before the Zhou and the Warring States.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nDo not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend.\nDo not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal.\nDo not display what is desirable, and the people’s hearts will not be disordered.\nThus, in the sage’s governance, he empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their ambitions, and strengthens their bones, ever keeping the people without cunning or desire. He ensures that the clever dare not act; by acting through non-action, nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe ancient sage composed the *Mysterious Classic* to illuminate the imperial Dao and the virtue of emperors. The world is vast, and things are manifold—what exists in the world must not exist in me. If those above exalt their own superiority over others, prize rare goods, or display their desires, then those below will take these three as their hearts’ aims: they will contend, steal, and create disorder. Only when I have no desires will they, though rewarded, not covet. Thus, in governing the world, the sage must first empty his own mind, not obstructing affairs; fill his own belly, not allowing evil to enter; weaken his own ambitions, not competing with things; and strengthen his own bones, not opposing with force. He constantly keeps the people from transgressive knowledge and usurping desires. Even if there were one as wise as the giant Longbo, who could hook the six great turtles, he would not dare to commit the slightest transgression or usurpation—how then could there be rebellious ministers or treacherous sons? The rulers of remote antiquity governed the world by acting without contrivance, and so nothing remained ungoverned.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nAbysmal! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\nBlunting its sharpness, untying its tangles,\nHarmonizing its light, uniting with its dust—\nProfound! It seems ever present.\nI know not whose child it is; it seems the image of what preceded the Lord.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThat which governs Heaven and Earth and administers the myriad things is the mind. The mind is the pivot of the Dao; all people possess this mind, and in this mind, the Dao resides. Only through its empty subtlety and wondrous function, its abysmal stillness and capacity, can it embrace the six directions without appearing full. Its knowledge pervades the myriad things without departing from its source. Once this Dao is obscured by things, the mind becomes as if blocked by thatch. When responding to affairs and engaging with things, one must first rectify what lies within, and then what lies without will not disturb. At the first hint of entanglement or sharpness disturbing the center, one must blunt and untie it. When purity is thorough, one can harmonize light and dust, coexisting without conflict. Thus, one’s empty subtlety and wondrous function, luminous and penetrating, lie hidden within—profound, as if ever present. To regard it as mine, I know not whose child it is; to regard it as not mine, it yet resembles the image of what preceded my spirit and lord. Unless one is clear and bright, with a spirit-like will and qi, who could comprehend this?\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not benevolent; he treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nThe space between Heaven and Earth—is it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it produces.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion; it is better to hold to the center.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nHeaven’s duty is to cover, Earth’s duty is to bear, and the sage’s duty is to transform. Enabling the myriad things and the hundred clans to each fulfill their lives, and though they accomplish this, they do not regard it as benevolence—such is the utmost benevolence. Not regarding it as benevolence, they have no expectation of reward, and thus, like straw dogs, no thought of discarding things. It is like the state’s sacrificial offerings, where straw dogs are bound for the spirits. During the sacrifice, though the straw dog is humble, it must be set out; once the rite is complete, though the embroidered silk is noble, it must be removed. How could there be a mind that distinguishes between noble and base? It is simply a matter of what is fitting. Moreover, the myriad things and the hundred clans are what Heaven and Earth rely upon to perfect their virtue of covering and bearing, and what the sage relies upon to perfect his work of transformation—how should they be treated? Observe the space between Heaven and Earth, like a bellows: empty yet capacious, it does not exhaust; moving without losing the center, it produces ever more. The sounds of Heaven’s pipes are myriad and different, yet if they arise of themselves, each takes what it will—who is the one who forces them? The sage’s relation to the hundred clans is the same. Should he act much or speak often, issuing frequent decrees, he will soon be exhausted. One must regard Heaven and Earth as a bellows, empty the mind to embody the Dao, and truly hold to the center—this is how Yao, reverent and silent in non-action, treated all equally as straw, and the world was governed.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe valley spirit does not die; it is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nSubtle and continuous, as if present—its use is inexhaustible.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe valley spirit is the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is empty at its center, and the valley spirit resides there. Heaven has this valley spirit, and humans have this valley spirit—its nature as a valley is the same. Mysterious and identical with yin and yang, it embraces and contains creation; its spirit is the wondrous functioning of the myriad things. Only because it does not die can it generate and transform without end. The Mysterious Female is yin and yang.",

      "translated_text": "The gate is the portal through which Qian and Kun undergo their transformations; the root is the source from which the myriad transformations arise. \"Subtle and continuous, as if present\"—this endures from ancient times to the present without cease. \"Its use is inexhaustible\"—this arises from spontaneity.\n\nThis passage elaborates upon the preceding chapter’s analogy of the bellows and the key to Heaven and Earth, revealing that the Supreme Ultimate within our hearts and the Dao of our bodies as Heaven and Earth flow in unison with the Creator, never born and never dying. The valley’s emptiness responds with perfect receptivity, serving as a metaphor for our hearts. The spirit’s stillness engenders numinosity, serving as an analogy for our nature. In the midst of profound quiescence, one perceives the wondrous resonance of responsiveness—only then is the meaning of \"not dying\" revealed. Yet spirit cannot arise without qi, nor can qi be numinous without spirit. Where spirit is spoken of, qi is already present. When spirit and qi intermingle and merge, only then is the Mysterious Female manifest.\n\nThe Mysterious (Xuan) takes root in Heaven, possessing the virtue of the Father—it is the origin of spirit. The Female (Pin) takes root in Earth, possessing the virtue of the Mother—it is the origin of qi. Is not the Mysterious Female the Heaven and Earth within our bodies? The gate is where spirit and qi return to their origin, the place of their interaction, as if something were present. Inhaling and exhaling, yet none perceive the gate—thus may the opening and closing of our bodies be seen. The root is where spirit and qi return to their origin, the ground of their intermingling, as if something were present. Generation after generation, transformation after transformation, yet none perceive the root—thus may the Supreme Ultimate within our bodies be seen. Observing its \"as if present\" within the continuous flow, one finds its \"inexhaustible use.\" From this, we may understand how the Old Sage, spanning the Shang and Zhou dynasties for over nine hundred years, mastered the essentials of cultivating the Dao and nurturing longevity—all encompassed herein.\n\nThe *Liezi* also contains this passage, though it attributes it not to Laozi but to the Yellow Emperor. The *Book* states: It is evident that Laozi’s *Five Thousand Characters* draws extensively from the ancient words of the *Canon* and *Classic*. For instance, wherever the *Classic* speaks of \"therefore the sage,\" \"what the ancients called,\" \"it is said in established teachings,\" \"thus the sages declared,\" or \"there are words on the use of arms,\" it clearly cites the transmitted sayings of the ancient sages. Thus, Confucius, though he \"transmitted but did not create,\" subtly aligned himself with them. Only those who \"believe in and delight in antiquity\" may be spoken to of this Dao.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nHeaven is eternal, Earth enduring.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and enduring\nIs that they do not live for themselves—\nThus they can long endure.\nTherefore the sage places himself last yet finds himself first,\nConsiders himself external yet finds himself preserved.\nIs it not because he is selfless?\nThus he fulfills his self.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nHeaven’s eternity and Earth’s endurance cannot be surpassed. Yet by what principle do Heaven and Earth attain their long and enduring nature? The heart of Heaven and Earth is one with all things, capable of generating life without taking self-preservation as its own life. Thus, nothing harms them, and they attain long life. Observing this, the sage embodies the Dao in action, free from the slightest trace of self-interest. He knows only to place the world before himself and to internalize the Dao while externalizing his own person. Thus, though he places himself last, he is inevitably first—people push him forward. Though he considers himself external, he is inevitably preserved—nothing harms him. The body is one’s closest possession, yet to place it last and externalize it is fundamentally selfless. By placing oneself last and externalizing oneself, one paradoxically finds oneself first and preserved—self-interest is thus fulfilled. How could the sage intentionally seek self-interest? It is precisely through selflessness that he fulfills his self-interest. The sage governs Heaven and Earth and administers the myriad things, yet never selfishly preserves his own life. Only by not living for himself does the vitality of life endure.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe highest virtue is like water.\nWater benefits the myriad things yet contends not;\nIt dwells in places all others disdain—\nThus it is near to the Dao.\nIn dwelling, be like the earth.\nIn the heart, be like the abyss.\nIn association, be like kindness.\nIn speech, be like truth.\nIn governance, be like order.\nIn affairs, be like capability.\nIn action, be like timeliness.\nOnly by not contending\nDoes one avoid blame.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe highest virtue is perfect virtue. The nature of water is perfectly virtuous. The person of highest virtue is humble and lowly, possessing the virtue of water. When Yu served as Minister of Works, he had already grasped the goodness of water’s nature, enabling him to fully realize water’s nature and accomplish the work of regulating the waters. From the highest virtue, he effortlessly entered the realm of the sage. There is no other reason—he simply acted without contrivance. Mencius said, \"No person is without goodness; no water is without downward flow\"—there is indeed a reason for this. Water benefits things without contention, dwelling in places all disdain, thus it is near to the Dao. Water’s virtues are manifold. The *Classic* lists seven; the rest may be inferred by analogy. Abiding where it dwells, it is \"good at dwelling in the earth.\" Clear and deep, undisturbed, it is \"good at the heart like the abyss.\" Moistening things without partiality, it is \"good at association like kindness.\" Flowing downward without change, it is \"good at speech like truth.\" Softness overcoming strength, it is \"good at governance like order.\" Bearing the heavy and floating the light, it is \"good at affairs like capability.\" Waxing and waning without loss, it is \"good at action like timeliness.\" If one can emulate water’s virtue, conduct oneself with goodness, and contend with nothing, what blame could there be? At the moment of Yao’s transmission to Shun and Shun’s to Yu, they should have been most diligent in humility and non-boasting, contending with none. Only Yu was truly worthy of contending for merit.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nTo hold and fill it to the brim\nIs not as good as stopping in time.\nTo hammer and sharpen it to a point\nCannot be long preserved.\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall,\nNone can guard them.\nWealth and honor leading to arrogance\nBring calamity upon oneself.\nWhen merit is achieved and fame established, withdraw—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nHumility leads to increase, fullness to loss; hardness breaks, softness endures—this is the inevitable principle of Heaven. Thus, one who understands the noble must restrain himself, and the sharp must be swiftly blunted—this is the way of the wise in preserving themselves. If one holds fullness without caution or sharpens a point without concealment, the vessel will surely overturn, and the blade will surely break—its inability to be long preserved is clear. When gold and jade fill the hall, who can guard them? Wealth and honor leading to arrogance bring calamity upon oneself.",

      "translated_text": "Those who occupy high positions, bearing heavy seals of office, grow arrogant, extravagant, dissolute, and insatiable—never knowing moderation or contentment. When the tripod shatters and the cauldron overturns, none can preserve their vital essence, and all perish without meeting a natural end. How much better is the gourd on Mount Ji or the single boat on the Five Lakes! Thus we know: merit need not be great—only those who know when to stop succeed. Fame need not be lofty—only those who know contentment attain fulfillment.\n\nHow few in this world escape the net of profit, break free from the tether of fame, withdraw from the rushing current, and preserve themselves in accord with the Dao of Heaven! To achieve merit and retire—this is the Dao of Heaven, grasped only by Yao and Shun.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nCarry your soul and embrace the One—can you never part from it?\nConcentrate your qi and attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?\nPurify and refine your profound vision—can you be without blemish?\nLove the people and govern the state—can you do so without action?\nThe gates of Heaven open and close—can you remain feminine?\nUnderstand the four directions—can you do so without knowledge?\nGive life and nurture, yet do not possess;\nAct, yet do not rely;\nLead, yet do not dominate—\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nOnly by cultivating the self can one govern the state, for the self is like the state, and the hundred limbs like the multitude. Thus the noble person cannot but cultivate the self. Human life carries the soul and embraces the One—can it hold them without separation? If not separated, it becomes One. Qi is the master of the hundred limbs; concentrate your qi and attain suppleness—can you be like an infant? If like an infant, you attain suppleness. The profound cannot be seen; purify and refine your vision—can you be without blemish? Without blemish, you attain the profound. To love the people and govern the state, value preservation and peace—can you do so without action? Without action, you attain peace. The gates of Heaven open and close; value stillness and guard it—can you remain feminine? If feminine, you attain stillness. To understand the four directions, value unimpeded clarity—can you do so without knowledge? Without knowledge, you are not obstructed.\n\nOne who embodies these six attainments, cultivating the self and governing the state, gives life through the Dao and nurtures through virtue. Each thing and self attains its natural course—giving life, acting, leading, yet not possessing, not relying, not dominating. This is why the people of Emperor Yao knew nothing, understood nothing, and asked, \"What has the emperor’s power to do with us?\"—this is called profound virtue.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThirty spokes share one hub;\nWhere it is empty, lies the use of the wheel.\nClay is shaped into a vessel;\nWhere it is empty, lies the use of the vessel.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room;\nWhere it is empty, lies the use of the room.\nThus, being serves as advantage,\nNon-being serves as use.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe sage observes images to create tools, benefiting the world—there is wisdom in this. Movement is round, stillness square—these are the images of Heaven and Earth. Their emptiness is their use. Qi forms the sun, moon, and stars; shape forms mountains, rivers, and plants. Being exists within non-being, non-being within being—nothing is excluded. Thirty spokes share one hub: the wheel’s roundness images Heaven, the carriage’s square images Earth—this is the \"being\" of the cart. Its emptiness is its \"non-being.\" Where it is empty lies the cart’s use. Observing how the hollow hub turns and the empty carriage bears, we see that form serves the advantage of the formless, and the formless serves the use of form—its wonder lies therein.\n\nThe *Classic* speaks of the wheel’s spokes and hub but not of the wheel, carriage, shaft, or traces—yet in speaking of the cart, its entirety is implied. The same principle applies to shaping clay into vessels or cutting doors and windows to make a room. The Dao speaks of being and non-being, the *Book of Changes* of movement and stillness—both are one. Clarify the non-being of the Dao, and you see the stillness of the *Changes*. Clarify the movement of the *Changes*, and you see the being of the Dao. The meaning of being and non-being, the mechanism of movement and stillness—how vast they are!\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate,\nRacing and hunting madden the mind,\nRare goods corrupt conduct.\nThus the sage is for the belly, not the eyes—\nTherefore he rejects that and chooses this.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nWhen the sage is above, he serves as a model for the people, and the world follows his example. What those above favor, those below emulate—like wind and cloud responding to dragon and tiger, or water and fire to moisture and dryness, without need for summoning. Thus, whatever is vain, extravagant, and harmful to the people’s livelihood is rejected and not chosen.\n\nKnowing that the five colors dazzle and blind the eyes, he does not pursue adornment but guards purity and simplicity. Knowing that the five tones confuse and deafen the ears, he does not indulge in lewd music but guards silence and stillness. Knowing that the five flavors cloy and dull the palate, he does not seek delicacies but guards frugality and plainness. Knowing that racing and hunting madden the mind, he does not indulge in frivolous amusements but guards tranquility and constancy. Knowing that rare goods corrupt conduct, he does not pursue worldly treasures but guards the Heavenly nobility.\n\nThese five are all extravagances that agitate the true nature and harm the people’s livelihood—no benefit to sustaining life. They are not the way of filling the belly, strengthening the root, and enduring long. Thus the sage values the substance of the belly, not the splendor of the eyes. Therefore he rejects that and chooses this, practicing frugality himself to encourage the people. He seeks to transform the world naturally, so each person is content, no external desires usurp their nature, and the world is governed.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nFavor and disgrace are both startling;\nRegard great calamity as you do your body.\nWhat is meant by \"favor and disgrace are both startling\"?\nFavor is lowly—\nTo gain it is startling, to lose it is startling—\nThis is what is meant by \"favor and disgrace are both startling.\"\nWhat is meant by \"regard great calamity as you do your body\"?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nIs that I have a body.\nIf I had no body,\nWhat calamity could I have?\nThus, one who values the self as the world\nMay be entrusted with the world;\nOne who loves the self as the world\nMay be charged with the world.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe sage values the self through the Dao, while the multitude values the self through fame—how vastly different they are!",

      "translated_text": "To value the self through the Dao is non-action. To value the self through fame is to act without cease for the self. Favor and disgrace are both startling—where there is favor, there is disgrace; how could one not be startled? To regard great calamity as one does the self: whether valuing the self or valuing fame, the calamity is the same.\n\nWhat is meant by \"favor and disgrace\"? Favor is lowly, and fame is thereby manifest. To gain it is startling, to lose it is startling—fearing loss and coveting gain, both are equally startling. What is meant by \"regarding great calamity as one does the self\"? The reason I have great calamity is that I have a self, and having a self means clinging to things. Clinging to things, one cannot escape the burden of fame. Without a self, one forgets things; forgetting things, the burden of fame is cast off. This is spoken for those who value the self through fame. The sage values the self through the Dao—what weariness could there be?\n\nKnowing fame is not worth valuing, one sees the value of the self. Knowing the self is not worth valuing, one sees the value of the Dao. Seeing the value of the Dao, what calamity could I have? When Han and Wei contended over land, Master Zihua advised Marquis Zhaoxi to cast off his two arms in exchange for the world. The marquis refused—thus his two arms were heavier than the world. The self is heavier than two arms, and the Dao is heavier still than the self.\n\nWhen the noble person is compelled to govern the world, they must be able to value the self as the world—such valuing may entrust them with the world. To love the self as the world—such love may charge them with the world. \"Valuing\" speaks of position; \"loving\" speaks of virtue. Valuing position allows one to be entrusted; loving virtue allows one to be charged. Yet knowing position may be relinquished while virtue cannot, then favor and disgrace become light—what calamity could I have?\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nLook and it cannot be seen—it is called *Yi*.\nListen and it cannot be heard—it is called *Xi*.\nGrasp and it cannot be held—it is called *Wei*.\nThese three cannot be fathomed,\nThus they merge into one.\nAbove, it is not bright;\nBelow, it is not dark.\nEndless, it cannot be named,\nReturning to nothingness.\nThis is called the formless form,\nThe imageless image,\nCalled the indistinct and evanescent.\nMeet it and you do not see its beginning;\nFollow it and you do not see its end.\nHold to the ancient Dao\nTo master the present being.\nTo know the ancient beginning\nIs called the thread of the Dao.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nOne cannot but know the Dao; the Dao cannot but know the ancient. The ancient must have a beginning, and the beginning must have something. The things of the world are many—what thing is not the Dao? What Dao is not a thing? It cannot be named. Seek it by sight, by hearing, by grasping—*Yi*, unseen; *Xi*, unheard; *Wei*, unobtainable. Question it with words, yet it cannot be reached, thus it merges into one. Observe its above—it is not bright; observe its below—it is not dark. Endless, it cannot be named; once named, it returns to nothingness. The formless form, the imageless image, indistinct and evanescent—meet it and you do not see its beginning; follow it and you do not see its end. Thereby one sees that nothing is not the Dao, and no Dao is not a thing—the Dao is thus. If one can hold to this ancient, wondrously formless Dao to govern the wondrously formed present, not only may one perfect the self, but may also order the world, returning all to the Dao. Who would then be bound by things?\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nThe ancients who were good as scholars\nWere subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating,\nToo deep to be known.\nIt is only because they could not be known\nThat I force descriptions of them:\nHesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;\nCautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;\nReserved, as if a guest;\nYielding, as ice about to melt;\nSimple, as uncarved wood;\nVast, as a valley;\nOpaque, as muddy water.\nWho can make the muddy clear through stillness?\nWho can make the still come to life through movement?\nOne who preserves this Dao does not desire fullness.\nIt is only because they are not full\nThat they can be worn yet newly made.\n\nThe *Original Meaning* states:\nThe ancients who were good as scholars embraced the Dao and dwelled in constancy, cultivating hidden virtue, flowing with the world without self-importance. They attained the subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating principle, which the multitude could not know. Only because they could not be known do I force descriptions of them—like the seven \"as ifs\" below, all embodying the mean, neither leaning nor drifting.\n\nHesitant, as if crossing a winter stream—no hasty advance.\nCautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides—no reckless movement.\nReserved, as if a guest—no wantonness.\nYielding, as ice about to melt—no rigidity.\nSimple, as uncarved wood—no adornment.\nVast, as a valley—no obstruction.\nOpaque, as muddy water—no artifice.\n\nWho can make the muddy clear through stillness? Who can make the still come to life through movement? The order and disorder, safety and danger of human affairs are like the waxing and waning of heaven’s way—movement reaches its extreme and turns to stillness; stillness reaches its extreme and turns to movement. Had Qu Yuan known this Dao, his loyalty would not have led to drowning. Had Bo Yi known this Dao, his purity would not have led to starvation. Thus it is said: One who preserves this Dao does not desire fullness, having no insistence on fulfilling the self. Only without insisting on fulfilling the self can one be worn yet newly made—speaking of abiding in constancy without great change. The Old Sage passed through the two dynasties of Shang and Zhou, thrice parted at the Pass, four times entered the archives, wandering for over nine hundred years, and in his later years journeyed to the shifting sands—none knew his end. This is how to be good.\n\nThe *Classic* states:\nAttain utmost emptiness,\nAbide in profound stillness.\nThe ten thousand things arise together,\nAnd I observe their return.\nThings flourish abundantly,\nEach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nStillness is called returning to life;\nReturning to life is called constancy.\nKnowing constancy is called illumination.\nNot knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.\nKnowing constancy, one is all-embracing;\nAll-embracing, one is impartial;\nImpartial, one is kingly;\nKingly, one is heavenly;\nHeavenly, one is of the Dao;\nOf the Dao, one is enduring.\nTo the end of life, one is not imperiled.",

formless vastness,\nand guard it without loss,\nthey would not need to proclaim their virtue to all under heaven—\nyet the multitude of people and things would submit as guests.\n\nFor lords and kings

      "translated_text": "From the examples of **Yǔ’s** conquest of the **Yóu Mín** (有苗), **Táng’s** expedition against **Xià** (夏), and **Zhōu’s** assault on **Shāng** (商), we see the principle at work.\n\nWhen this is carried further, the *Qí* (奇) transforms into *Zhà* (诈)—deception—\nand deception then gives rise to *Luàn* (乱)—chaos.\n\nTo acquire the realm with no action of one’s own,\nis to embody the *Zhāng Mò* (章末) doctrine of *Wúwéi* (无为) and love of stillness,\nof *Wúshì* (无事) and *Wúyù* (无欲).\n\nHow do I know this to be true?\nFor when the **Zhōu** dynasty declined in the middle,\nKing **Lì** (厉王) coveted profit,\nand appointing **Róng Gōng** (荣公) as his minister,\nhe monopolized gain and harmed the people,\nso when the **Wèi** (卫) perverts and **Wū** (巫) censors reported him,\nhe had them killed.\nThe land was filled with taboos,\nyet the people grew ever poorer.\n\nThe **Huái Yí** (淮夷) raided in rebellion,\nand the people rose up against one another.\nKing **Yōu** (幽王) fled to **Jìng** (竞),\nand the **Gònghè** (共和) administration took charge,\nas the people multiplied their clever devices\nand the state flourished in corruption.\n\nKing **Yōu** (幽王) grew dissolute and debauched,\nand appointed **Shí Fù** (石父) as his minister,\nwho was skilled in flattery and profit-seeking,\nentrusted with affairs and given full authority,\nhis governance filled with perversity,\nso some lords rebelled,\nwhile the **Róng-Dí** (戎狄) slew him.\n\nWhen men abound in cunning arts,\nstrange contrivances multiply,\nlaws and decrees grow ever more explicit,\nand thieves and robbers proliferate.\n\nThus the sage says:\n*\"If I act with **Wúwéi** (无为), the people will transform themselves;\nIf I love **jìng** (静), the people will become upright;\nIf I have **Wúshì** (无事), the people will grow rich;\nIf I have **Wúyù** (无欲), the people will return to simplicity.\"*\n\nThe words of the ancient sages,\nthe **Xuánshèng** (玄圣) cites them as proof,\nare they not in accord with the sayings of *Fén* (坟) and *Diǎn* (典)?\n\nIn the second year of King **Yōu** (幽王),\nthe three rivers of the **Xī Zhōu** (西周) trembled.\nThe Grand Historian **Bó Yáng Fù** (伯阳父) declared:\n*\"In days past, when the **Yí** (伊) and **Luò** (洛) rivers dried up, **Xià** (夏) perished;\nwhen the **Jiāng** (江) river dried up, **Shāng** (商) perished.\nNow the **Zhōu** (周) **virtue** (德) is like that of the three dynasties in their decline—\nthey will not endure beyond the count of ten years.\"*\n\nThat year, the three rivers dried up,\nand the **Qí Shān** (岐山) collapsed.\nThree years later, the **Shēn Hòu** (申侯) was deposed,\nand the former heir **Yí Jiù** (宜臼) was removed,\nwhile favor was bestowed upon **Bào Sì** (褒姒) as queen,\nand her son **Bó Fú** (伯服) was made heir.\n\nThe **Bó Yáng** (伯阳) read the records and said:\n*\"The **Zhōu** (周) is already destroyed.\"*\n\nIn the eleventh year, the king sought to kill the former heir **Yí Jiù** (宜臼),\nand marched against **Shēn** (申).\nThe **Shēn Hòu** (申侯) allied with the **Dèng** (邓) people,\nsummoning the **Xī Yí** (西夷) and **Quǎn Róng** (犬戎),\nto attack and slay the king,\nand install the former heir **Yí Jiù** (宜臼) as **Píng Wáng** (平王).\nHe relocated to the **East Capital** (东都),\nand the **West Capital** (西周) was indeed abandoned.\n\n**Bó Yáng** (伯阳), surnamed **Lǎoshèng** (老圣),\nonce served **Xī Bó** (西伯) as the **Cángshǐ** (藏史),\nand under King **Chéng** (成王) as **Zhùxiàshǐ** (柱下史),\nwhile in the time of King **Yōu** (幽王) he was the **Grand Historian** (太史).\nHe cultivated the **Dao** (道) and nourished his years,\noften holding the **Shìkuài** (史快) office,\nand expounding the *Xuánjīng* (玄经).\nHis divinations and records endure for ten thousand generations—\nthis is what I call the **nameless ancient historian** (无名古史),\nwhose truth can now be verified.\n\nThough his station was that of a subject,\nhis **Dao** (道) surpassed that of a hundred kings—\nhe was a sage who held the **Dao** (道) yet lacked position.\n\nThe *Jīng* (经) states:\n*\"When governance is **mènmèn** (闷闷) [deep and unobtrusive],\nits people are **chúnhún** (淳淳) [pure and sincere].\nWhen governance is **cháhè** (察察) [sharp and scrutinizing],\nits people are **quēquē** (缺缺) [deficient and cunning].\"*\n\nMisfortune, oh, where fortune leans,\nFortune, oh, where misfortune lurks—\nWho knows their ultimate measure?\nIs it not the absence of **Zhèng** (正)?\n\n**Zhèng** (正) becomes *Qí* (奇),\n**Shàn** (善) becomes *Yāo* (妖).\nThe people’s confusion is indeed long-standing.\n\nThus the sage is square yet does not cut,\nhonest yet not harsh,\nupright yet not domineering,\nbright yet not dazzling.\n\nThe *Yuanzhǐ* (原旨) says:\n*\"Governance like that of **Fūzǐ** (夫子) [the sage],\nwhere **virtue** (德) is the foundation of **mènmèn** (闷闷) governance,\nand **Lǐ** (礼) is used for harmonization—\nits policies are broad and expansive,\nand the people take joy in their work,\nwhile customs become **chúnhún** (淳淳) and **cháhè** (察察).*\n\n*\"Or governance like that of **Qí** (齐),\nwhere **Xíng** (刑) [laws] are enforced strictly—\nits decrees are severe and rigid,\nand the people are left bewildered and at a loss,\ntheir actions **quēquē** (缺缺).*\n\n*\"This is the saying: ‘When the upper levels carve too finely,\nthe lower levels respond with **Bùxiào** (不肖) [depravity].’*\nMisfortune, oh, where fortune leans,\nFortune, oh, where misfortune lurks—\nrelying on fortune to act arrogantly,\nmisfortune is soon to follow;\nfearing misfortune and cultivating **virtue** (德),\nfortune is soon to follow.\nMisfortune and fortune alternate like winter and summer—\nwho knows their ultimate measure?\n\n*\"**Yíng** (盈) and **Xū** (虚), **xiāoxì** (消息)—\nwhen things reach their extreme,\nthey must change—\nthere is no fixed **Zhèng** (正) or **Yé** (邪).*\n\n*\"The **Dao** of Heaven has no constant form—\nthis is the language of doubt and verification.*\n\n**Yǔ** (禹) ascended the **Lù Dì** (陆帝) throne with **Zhèng** (正) governance,\nyet his descendants did not follow it.\nThe **Huángtiān** (皇天) sent calamity,\nand through **Táng** (汤), it corrected **Zhèng** (正) with *Qí* (奇).\n\n**Táng** (汤) waged war because of **Gě Bó** (葛伯)’s failure to worship,\nyet his guilt surpassed that of **Jié** (桀),\nand through **Zhōu** (周), **Shàn** (善) became *Yāo* (妖).\nThe people’s confusion is indeed long-standing.\n\n*\"To know preservation yet not know destruction,\nto know gain yet not know loss—\nthis has been the case from ancient times.\"*",

Dao/Way preserves the world.\nA small realm seeks only to submit and serve others—\nthe one who fears the Dao/Way preserves its own land.\nBoth attain what they desire,\nexchanging mutual sustenance (交相养) and finding harmony (得其宜),\nlike mountains and valleys to grasses and trees (草木),\nwhen they do not sharply distinguish between the high and the low (不锐上丰下),\nthen they honor the roots while slighting the branches (则重本轻末).\nFor the great, when they dwell in humility (处下),\nthe small will find no realm they cannot bear and contain (容载).\nWhen the small flourish and spread their virtue (敷荣),\nthe great will find no realm that is not abundantly prosperous (富庶).\nThus, the great ought to dwell in humility (为下).\n\nWhen Confucius saw Laozi,\nand afterward Mencius emerged,\nwas there not one who gained wisdom from what they saw and heard?\nThe *Classics* say:\n*The Dao/Way is the hidden mystery (奥) of all things,*\n*a treasure for the virtuous (善人之宝),*\n*a safeguard for the unvirtuous (不善人之所保).*\n*Fine words can be used to trade (市),*\n*noble deeds can elevate a person (加人).*\n*Though people may be unvirtuous, why should they be abandoned?*\nThus, when establishing a Son of Heaven (天子) and appointing the Three Exalted Ministers (三公),\neven if one offers a jade tablet with four horses,\nit is not as valuable as simply sitting and imparting this Dao/Way.\nThis is why the ancients held this Dao/Way in such esteem—\nwas it not because seeking it brings reward (有所得),\nand possessing it exempts one from blame (有罪以免)?\n\nThus, it is the most precious for all under heaven.\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*The Dao/Way encompasses Heaven and Earth,*\n*concealing and nurturing all things,*\n*like a household’s inner chambers (阃奥).*\n*When the virtuous obtain it, they can make it a treasure for themselves.*\n*When the unvirtuous obtain it, they can make it a safeguard for themselves.*\n*Fine words can be used to trade,*\n*like Yao’s admonition to Shun: “Consider the matter well.”*\n*Noble deeds can elevate a person,*\n*as when you ascended to the imperial throne (汝陟帝位者).*\n*Fine words and noble deeds are the Dao/Way manifested externally (发于外者),*\n*yet even these can be used to trade and elevate—*\n*how much more so when the Dao/Way is preserved within!*\n*Though people may be unvirtuous, why should they be abandoned?*\n*The Book of Documents* says:\n*“To know people is wisdom (哲),*\n*to appoint them properly is governance (官人).*\n*To settle the people is benevolence (惠),*\n*and the common folk will cherish you (黎民怀之).”*\n*If one is wise and benevolent,*\n*why fear the treachery of Huan Dou (欢兜),*\n*why be exiled by the Youmiao (有苗),*\n*why dread the deceitful tongues and pleasing appearances of Gong Ren (孔壬)?*\n\n*Observe Yao’s words “Ah!” and “Alas!” (曰吁曰佛),*\n*and the wickedness of the Four Tyrants (四凶) was known*\n*even without Shun’s judgment.*\n*Yet, when their wickedness was proclaimed (声其不善),*\n*Yao did not immediately punish them (不即罪),*\n*which shows his imperial virtue (帝德) was broad and far-reaching,*\n*his benevolence as vast as Heaven (其仁如天),*\n*and he did not lightly take life (不轻杀戮).*\n\nThus, when establishing a Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Exalted Ministers,\nthe Son of Heaven acts as father and mother to the people (作民父母),\nthe Three Exalted Ministers discuss the Dao/Way and govern the realm (论道经邦),\nthey harmonize (燮) the principles of yin and yang,\nassist in the transformation and nurturing of all things (赞化育),\nsettle the people, and preserve the world.\n*The Book of Documents* says:\n*“Do not neglect the officials of the people (无旷庶官),*\n*for the work of Heaven, let man take its place (天工人其代之).”*\n*Beyond this, inspect the four directions (巡四岳),*\n*audience the feudal lords (朝诸侯),*\n*though one may have the honor of a jade tablet with four horses,*\n*or the splendor of a chariot with four horses,*\n*these are but external matters (外物),*\n*far less valuable than humbling oneself and facing south,*\n*sitting to impart this Dao/Way,*\n*and letting all under heaven govern itself (自治).*\n\nThis is why the ancients held this Dao/Way in such esteem—\nwas it not for this reason?\nIt is not merely that seeking it brings reward,\nand possessing it exempts one from blame.\nThus, it is the most precious for all under heaven.\n\nWhen the people are ignorant and misguided (昏垫),\nand unfortunately bear the guilt of wickedness (有不善之罪),\nthen the ruler laments and pities them, saying:\n*“I am the one who wronged them.”*\n*“Yea” (耶) is an uncertain word.*\n*This is not to condone their wickedness,*\n*but to recognize that those who carry out punishments (自有司杀者) exist.*\n*Thus, he holds the left contract (执左契) and does not blame the people,*\n*using this virtue of cherishing life (好生之德)*\n*to win the hearts of the people (洽于民心).*\n*If one were like Yao, they could be called*\n*the most precious for all under heaven and all ages.*\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*“To act without action (无为),*\n*to govern without governance (无事),*\n*to savor without savoring (无味).*\n*Great or small, many or few,*\n*repay resentment with virtue (报怨以德).*\n*Plan for difficulty in its ease (图难於其易),*\n*achieve greatness in its smallness (为大於其细).*\n*The most difficult matters in the world,*\n*must be begun in ease (必作於易).*\n*The greatest affairs

trustworthiness (寡信).*\n*He who is prone to change,*\n*will encounter many difficulties (多难).*\n*Thus, the Sage still finds difficulty,*\n*and so never faces difficulty.*\n\nThe *Original Meaning* says:\n*The aged Sage (老圣) sighed at the corruption of the Dao/Way,*\n*that the clever and deceitful (智诈) deceived one another,*\n*leading to chaos (为乱),*\n*and there was no way to restore the hearts of the people (无以挽回人心).*\n*Thus, he expounded the ancient Way of non-action (敷迷上古无为之化),*\n*to instruct posterity (诏后世),*\n*to turn the shallow and deceptive (锲薄) winds of the age*\n*into the pure and thick (淳厚) qi of virtue,*\n*and to rely on the Dao/Way.*\n\n*Thus, to act without action is to follow nature (法自然).*\n*To govern without governance is to align with Heaven’s principles (顺天理).*\n*To savor without savoring is to delight in simplicity (乐恬淡).*\n*Great or small, many or few—*\n*all are contained within the relations of lord and subject, ruler and common folk (君臣民庶在焉).*\n*To repay resentment with virtue,*\n*when there is interaction between the high and the low (上下之交),*\n*if there is wickedness, then one should repay it with virtue as their heart.*\n*As it says: “I treat the good with goodness, and the wicked also with goodness.”*\n\n*Plan for difficulty in its ease,*\n*achieve greatness in its smallness—*\n*one’s schemes must be cautious from the beginning (谨始),*\n*and not allow difficulties to grow unchecked (无使滋蔓难图).*\n*The most difficult matters in the world,*\n*must be begun in ease (必作於易).*\n*The greatest affairs in the world,*\n*must be begun in smallness (必作於细).*\n*This is the principle of things (物理所在).*\n*From the subtle to the manifest (从微至着),*\n*like the easy reversals of the *I Ching* (易之不远复),*\n*without regret or remorse (无祇悔),*\n*from one yang to two yangs (一阳二阳),*\n*accumulating to become the *Qian* (乾).*\n*Thus, the Sage never strives for the great,*\n*and so can achieve the great.*\n\n*The Sage has the virtue of *Qian* (六阳之德),*\n*not making themselves great,*\n*yet achieving greatness.*\n\n*He who makes light of promises,*\n*will be few in his trustworthiness.*\n*He who is prone to change,*\n*will encounter many

(有始有卒).*\n*Only because the Sage finds difficulty in the beginning,*\n*do they never face difficulty in the end.*\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*“Its stability is easy to maintain,*\n*its early signs are

      "translated_text": "Thus, what is the role of those who follow life, and what of those who follow death? From the Great Polarity arise the Two Complements—*Qian* the firm, *Kun* the yielding—heaven and earth uniting in virtue.\n\n*Qian* is heaven. Heaven’s One generates water: the father is firm, the child yielding, so water’s nature is soft and weak, its virtue to follow downward. Earth’s Two generates fire: the mother is yielding, the child firm, so fire’s nature is flaming upward, its virtue dry and hard.\n\nWere it not for fire’s firmness, *Qian*’s vigorous body would not manifest. Were it not for water’s yielding, *Kun*’s accommodating function would not be fulfilled. Only through the interplay of firm and yielding does the enduring and vast virtue emerge.\n\nIn birth, the human is soft and weak—heaven’s water sustains it. In death, it becomes rigid and strong—earth’s fire reclaims it. Only when firm and yielding balance does the work of life and death complete itself, and thus the Dao of longevity and enduring vision lies within. Hence, the nurturers of life take this as their law.\n\nThe yielding and weak give life; the firm and strong bring death. Just as a strong army cannot prevail—it is attacked by many—so too a rigid tree is felled by many axes. The firm and great are lowly; the yielding and weak are exalted. This is the Way of Heaven.\n\nThe sages and the old masters say: yielding and weak preserve *qi*; firm and strong deplete the body. When *qi* is harmonious, life flourishes; when the body is robust, aging comes. Aging leads to death, and death must return to its source. To return to the infant state, to return to the Boundless—this is the Way of return.\n\nThe *Classic* says: The Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow. The high are lowered; the low are raised. The excessive are diminished; the deficient are supplemented. Heaven’s Way is to diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient. But the Way of humanity is otherwise: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. Who can serve the world with its excess? Only the Daoist.\n\nThus the sage acts without relying on it, achieves without claiming it, and does not seek to be seen as virtuous.\n\n*The Original Meaning* says: In the *Hongfan*, the ninth category is *Huangji* (the Sovereign Polarity). The Sovereign establishes the Polarity, speaking of the central Way standing firm, its central path encompassing the nine categories.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow. Using the analogy of drawing and releasing, the high are lowered, the low are raised—this is seen in the balance of high and low. The excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented—this is seen in the balance of great and small.\n\nEarth’s *qi* ascends; heaven’s *qi* descends—this is the Way of lowering the high and raising the low. Extreme heat turns to cold; extreme cold turns to warmth—this is the Way of diminishing the excessive and supplementing the deficient. The Way of Heaven thus bends toward the middle, achieving harmony and establishing the positions of heaven and earth, nurturing all things.\n\nBut the Way of nurturing humanity is otherwise: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive. Heaven’s nature and human desires are ever in opposition. The so-called gentleman practices the Mean; the petty man rejects it. Who can serve the world with its excess, as heaven’s clouds move and rain nourishes all things? Only the Daoist—this is the saying: *Virtue lies in good governance; governance lies in nurturing the people.*\n\nThe sage acts without presumption, expecting no reward. When the work is done, he does not dwell on it—this is the Way of Heaven. He does not seek to be seen as virtuous; he simply holds to the Mean.\n\nThe sage’s deeds are both action and non-action, encompassing heaven and earth. The common people do not recognize this.\n\nAh! The heavens’ burden is without sound or scent.\n\nThe *Classic* says: Under Heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than water. Yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the firm and strong. There is no substitute for it. Thus, the yielding overcomes the firm; the weak overcomes the strong. All know this, yet none can practice it.\n\nHence the sage says: To bear the nation’s impurities is to be its sovereign. To bear the nation’s misfortunes is to be its king. His words seem inverted.\n\n*The Original Meaning* says: Softness overcomes hardness; the female overcomes the male—this is the principle. No thing is softer and weaker than water, yet when it reaches its fullness, it breaches dams and floods rivers, and none can resist it.\n\nThe old sages pitied the decline of the Xia and Shang dynasties, fearing the rise of a second age of decline. Thus, through the question of Guan Yin, they admonished and rescued them, saying: All know this, yet none can practice it. Only Lord Yu attained it, using water to control water, leveling the earth so heaven’s order was fulfilled. King Tang attained it, conquering east and west, ever fearful of falling behind. The Western King attained it, subduing the barbarians and punishing the arrogant, yet none dared to rebel.",

      "translated_text": "Is this not the very essence of how the soft overcomes the hard? Had Jie understood this, he might have governed like the sage-kings Yu and Tang, and never would Tang have conquered him. Had Zhou understood this, he might have learned from the fall of Xia, and never would Wu have overthrown him. But because of their rigid cruelty and stubborn ignorance, there arose ministers who usurped their thrones—how dire the consequence!\n\nThus the sages declared: To bear a nation’s calamities is to be its sovereign. To bear a nation’s misfortunes is to be its king over all. These are the words of the ancient sages. When Gun was drowned, when Tang and Wen were imprisoned, none suffered greater calamities than they. Yet when Yu received the Mandate of Heaven through abdication, when Tang and Wu seized power themselves, they became sovereigns and kings over all.\n\nAlas! Jie and Zhou were indeed tyrants as rulers, while Tang and Wu were indeed sages as subjects. If Yu, through merit, received the Mandate peacefully, then no reproach attaches. But if Tang and Wu, through cunning and force, took the throne themselves, how could they avoid shame? Only King Wen, with his utmost reverence toward Zhou, never straying from propriety, could be compared in virtue to Yao and Shun.\n\nThe true intent of *The Mysterious Classic* is to admonish rulers: Rectify yourself, and you rectify the people. Rectify the people, and the realm’s order is fulfilled. How could a subject ever presume to replace his sovereign?\n\nThe proper relationship between ruler and subject: I, the people of the Yellow Emperor’s age, were unshackled by laws yet content with our food—coarse grains to eat, hollowed gourds to drink from, simple garments to wear, fur to ward off cold, and shelters of nests and caves to shield us from wind and rain. We took joy in our customs, cradling our infants and patting our bellies in contentment. Neighboring lands lay in sight, yet our paths never clashed. The sounds of roosters and dogs reached one another, yet all things flourished without harm. The people lived to old age without seeking one another’s company, knowing no desire to contest cities or lands. Heaven’s Way and Earth’s bounty were never wanting.\n\nTo ponder this passage: the ancient simplicity and purity still resonates through heaven and earth—just as it was then, so it remains now. Thus we know the sages’ wisdom was beyond the grasp of later-age tyrants.\n\nWhat they called a \"great sage encountered once in ten thousand years\" is one whose understanding dawns as naturally as day follows night.\n\n*The Classic* says:\n*\"Faithful words lack beauty; beautiful words lack truth.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue lack virtue.\nThe wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\nThe sage does not hoard.\nThe more one gives to others, the more one possesses.\nThe more one shares with others, the more one has.\nHeaven’s Way benefits without harming.\nThe sage’s Way acts without contention.\"*\n\n*The Original Meaning* says:\nThe sage’s heart is the heart of heaven and earth—boundless in acceptance, boundless in giving. Like water poured in but never full, drawn upon but never exhausted.\n\nBut common people are otherwise:\nBeautiful words lack truth, for they prize ornamentation.\nFaithful words lack beauty, for the Way values simplicity.\nThe virtuous do not argue, for they embrace all without reservation.\nThose who argue lack virtue, for they cling to words.\nThe wise are not learned, for they merge into oneness.\nThe learned are not wise, for they count without measure.\nThe sage does not hoard, for they align with the ebb and flow of time.\nThe more one gives to others, the more one possesses—\nfor the heart of nurturing life is ever-present.\nThe more one shares with others, the more one has—\nfor the heart of creation is inexhaustible.\nHeaven’s Way benefits without harming.\nHeaven’s lack of favor is itself the greatest favor.\nThe original intent of *The Mysterious Classic on Dao and Virtue* concludes here.",

Thus, through the question of Guan Yin, they admonished and rescued them, saying: All know this, yet none can practice it. Only Lord Yu attained it, using water to control water, leveling the earth so heaven’s order was fulfilled. King Tang attained it, conquering east and west, ever fearful of falling behind. The Western King attained it, subduing the barbarians and punishing the arrogant, yet none dared to rebel.",
