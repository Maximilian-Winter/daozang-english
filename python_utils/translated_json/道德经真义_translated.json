In its preface, it states: “The Huang [commentary] is particularly profound, truly revealing the mysterious Dao, each word bearing essential meaning. Thus, it should rightly be called *‘Refined Essence’* rather than *‘Annotated’*—hence the name change upon reissue, to benefit all.”\n\nThe following excerpt is taken from Xiao Tian Shi’s preface to the large-character edition of *The Refined Essence of the Daoist Classic*.\n\n**(I)** Across the ages, hundreds of scholars have annotated *The Daoist Classic*, with over fifty editions included in *The Daoist Canon*. The earliest commentaries were by Han Fei and He Shang Gong. Han Fei provided only *“Explicating Laozi”* and *“Parables of Laozi”*, while systematic annotation began with He Shang Gong. Among all the commentaries that have flourished over the millennia, the Wang Bi edition stands preeminent. During the Tang and Song dynasties, lesser scholars proliferated, and their works gradually increased in number—perhaps twenty to thirty enduring fine editions—but few achieved complete fidelity without error.\n\n**(II)** The annotated editions within *The Daoist Canon* each possess their merits: the Tang Xuanzong edition emphasizes **exhausting principles and perfecting nature** (穷理尽性), **sitting in forgetfulness and abandoning traces** (坐忘遗照), **reducing matters and non-action** (损事无为), and **governing the body and affairs** (理身理事); the Song Huizong edition, comprising three versions, frequently cites passages from *The Zuo Tradition* and *The Book of Changes* (《左》、《易》) to support its interpretations. The Ming Taizu edition’s annotations adhere strictly to **cultivating harmony and achieving peace** (修齐治平), while Su Shi’s son, Su Zhe’s commentary, delves deeply into the **root essence** (根宗), offering many insights into **nature’s intrinsic essence** (性之言) and harmonizing the perspectives of three schools into a singular intent. In the Qing dynasty, Daoist talents emerged in abundance, with Longyuanzi, Song Changqing, and Master Huang Yuangji producing the finest commentaries. Among these, Master Huang’s work most effectively **follows the strengths of each school** (宗各家之所长) and **complements their shortcomings** (补百家之不足). The Song dynasty edition has already been published in the *Daoist Canon*’s third collection; this edition reprints Master Huang’s commentary within it.\n\n**(III)** The distinctive features of Master Huang’s commentary are as follows: each chapter begins with **the eternal Dao** (常道), followed by **the Dao of alchemy** (丹道); it first discusses **worldly methods** (世法), then **alchemical methods** (丹法). The subtleties of Daoist learning are meticulously examined, with **profound meaning and refined logic** (精微，文理密察). It encompasses both **fundamentals and applications** (本末兼赅), harmonizing **form and function** (体用咸宜).\n\n「Its excellence lies in **fusing Confucianism into Dao** (融儒入道) while leaving **no trace of artificiality** (凿空无痕); and in **expanding Dao to exalt Confucianism** (因道弘儒) while maintaining **a unified and complete whole** (浑全一体). It clarifies **the Dao and cultivates virtue** (明道修德), thereby setting **the standard for the customs of the world** (端天下之风尚); and it **nurtures the heart and harmonizes the qi** (养心养气), sufficient to **rectify the minds of all beings** (正成世之人心). The author **illuminates the Dao of immortality** (明仙道) through **every word as unbreakable truth** (字字金科玉律); and **embodies the sacred learning** (体圣学) to elucidate **mystical studies** (阐玄学), with **each utterance a direct transmission of the essence** (言言口诀心传). Deep yet accessible, warm and straightforward—**putting it into practice** (以之为用), one may **clarify the mind and perceive true nature** (明心见性), **attain sainthood and ascend to the Dao** (入圣登真), **manifest wisdom in worldly affairs** (明哲处世), or **govern the state and bring peace to the world** (治国平天下). Whether in **official life or seclusion**, it is equally applicable (仕隐咸宜). Judging by its merit, it is **indeed an immortal masterpiece** (不朽名着) among commentaries on the *Dao De Jing*. **Regardless of Daoist or Confucian schools**, all may **revere it as the supreme scripture** (无上圣经), viewing it as **the unparalleled path to sainthood and immortality** (修圣修仙之不二法门).\n\n**(IV)** The **alchemical Dao’s texts grow ever more profound with age** (丹道经籍，愈古愈玄). In the **Upper Antiquity**, **alchemical scriptures were hidden in nine out of ten** (上古丹经，十隐八九); in the **Middle Antiquity**, **half were concealed** (中古丹经，十隐其半); until **recent times**, only **two or three out of ten were revealed** (近代丹经，十隐二三). This work by Master Huang was completed during the **transition between the Daoguang and Xianfeng reigns of the Qing dynasty** (清道咸之交), hence its ability to **unfurl the mystic mechanisms** (畅述玄机) and **display the essence of the Dao** (大露宗风), revealing **what the past sages kept secret** (往圣之所不泄者) and transmitting **what the past sages never imparted** (往圣之所不传者). In terms of **alchemical methods alone** (就丹法言丹法), this single text **already encompasses the vital essence of myriad alchemical canons** (括尽千经万典之要蕴), **without omission of great or small** (巨细无遗).\n\nWhen Master Huang lectured at **Hall of Joyous Nurturing** (乐育堂), thousands of disciples entered his gate (入门弟子数千人). His works, *Hall of Joyous Nurturing Sayings* (《乐育堂语录》) and *Essentials of the Daoist Gate* (《道门语要》), have long circulated and are **held in high regard by the world** (风行，为世所重). Yet his *Oral Essentials of the Mystic Dao* (《玄宗口诀》) was **rarely copied and transmitted** (传抄很少). His texts such as *Seeking the Heart* (《求心》) and *Awakening the Heart* (《醒心》) have **already been lost** (已失传), and now that this work has been recovered, it is **unendurable to let it vanish again** (不忍再令其湮没).\n\n**(V)** This book was originally published in **Qing Guangxu Year 10** (清光绪十年), with its plates stored in **Ziliu井, Sichuan** (四川自流井, 今自贡市自井区). Errors such as **misprints of fish for deer and boar for pig** (鲁鱼亥豕) were numerous. Three years ago, a printed edition was obtained from **Mr. Yin Qitang** (殷启唐先生), later sent back to South America. This year, the **unpunctuated edition from Mr. Wan Yang’s Hall of Nurturing Virtue** (乙亥华阳汪氏养性斋刊本), preserved by **Mr. Ma Bingwen and Mr. Ma Jiekang**, was acquired. Subsequently, a **refined edition from the Nanjing Red Cross Daoist Institute** (南京红十字会道院精刊本) was obtained through **Mr. Fu Anding** (傅安澄先生). For this reprinting, the original plan was to use the **Hall of Nurturing Virtue edition** (马养性斋刊本), but after careful collation and correction, the **Daoist Institute edition** (傅藏道院刊本) was chosen instead. **Mr. Yu Zheng** (俞以正) was too busy with Buddhist affairs to write about the provenance of these collected editions.\n\n**Winter, 12th month, Year of the Rat (庚子孟冬月), Taipei** (台北),\n**Shen Shi Xiao Tian Shi** (文山肖天石) wrote this.\n\n**Master Huang’s Preface to the Original Edition: The Three Teachings’ Dao is the Dao of the Sage** (三教之道，圣道而已). Confucianism speaks of **ultimate sincerity** (至诚), Daoism of **golden elixir** (金丹), Buddhism of **true emptiness** (真空)—yet all **refer to the same primordial qi of the Great Void** (太虚一气), **pervading heaven, earth, and all beings** (贯乎天地人物). Only the **Sage uniquely probes its source** (独探其原) and **reaches its utmost** (造其极), **unifying with the boundless emptiness of heaven and earth** (与天地虚圆无二), thus becoming the Sage. It **can be both firm and yielding** (能刚能柔), **both circular and square** (可圆可方), **defying form or description** (无形状可拟), **transcending sound or scent** (无声臭可拘). Its **divine transformations and marvelous operations** (神灵变化) are **inexhaustible** (其妙无穷), with **aspects beyond comprehension** (有不可得而窥测者). If all is **natural and spontaneous** (皆自然天然), **originally so** (本来特事), **neither augmented by the Sage nor diminished by the ordinary** (处圣不增，处凡不减), then even **the lesser beings—birds, beasts, grasses, and trees** (鸟兽草木之微)—**share the same qi and the same principle** (同此一气、同此一理) as the Sage.\n\nConsider the **vast, unfathomable ocean** (汪洋大海). Though its waters are **most difficult to measure** (水至难测), a **single ladleful** (一勺) contains no less than the **entire sea** (一海). The **qi of the Great Void** (太虚之气) is **likewise boundless**. Though **heaven, earth, sages, and all beings** (天地、圣贤、人物) may appear **diverse and chaotic** (纷纭错杂), with **ten thousand things unequal** (万有不齐), their **initial reception of qi and formation** (受气成形之初) all **originate from the same qi** (同此一气). Beyond this, **there is no other vital qi** (别无生气), nor **any other generative principle** (别无生理)—what differs is merely **the varied dispositions and endowments** (姿禀之各殊).\n\nMencius said, **\"The Yao and Shun shared the same nature as ordinary people\"** (尧舜与人同); and again, **\"The distinction between humans and beasts is slight\"** (人之异于禽兽者几希). This is **indeed a true discourse** (诚确论也).\n\nThe times are such that the **Dao/Way of the world declines daily** (世风日下), and **folk customs grow ever more deceitful** (民俗益偷). Though the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) belongs to the **plain and ordinary** (平常), people often regard it with **strange and bizarre eyes** (诡怪离奇目之). Thus, **Confucianism is ever more unlike true Confucianism** (儒益非儒), **Buddhism is ever more unlike true Buddhism** (释益非释), and **Daoism is ever more unlike true Daoism** (道益非道).\n\nIf one does not **point out the roots and origins** (指出根源), **pierce through and reveal the mysteries** (抉破窍妙), then **the Great Dao/Way will grow ever more obscured and unmanifest** (大道愈晦而不彰), and **human hearts will grow ever more corrupt and difficult to govern** (人心愈坏而难治)—until **all must be reduced to sharing the same fate as birds, beasts, grasses, and trees** (与鸟兽草木同群), while **sages and worthies are likened to mere barbarians and uncouth men** (圣贤直等诸弁髦), and **the Great Dao/Way becomes as perilous as a pile of eggs** (大道益危如累卵), **hanging precariously between heaven and earth** (虚悬天壤), with **no one daring to bear the weight of this sacred culture** (无人能任斯文之责).\n\nIn this fortunate age of **prosperity and peace** (恭逢盛世), when the **world is at rest** (天下平安), I **chanced upon** (适遇) **renowned mountain companions** (名山道友) and engaged in **discussions of the mysterious and wondrous** (谈玄说妙). Their words were **not mere idle chatter** (实非空谈者流), nor **empty rhetoric for the ears** (徒来口耳之用), but **truly beneficial** (不无小补于世). Thus, I **gained insight in their midst** (因得与于其际).\n\nThe **many esteemed friends** (群尊) **honored me with the teacher’s seat** (予以师席), so I **night and day expounded** (日夜讲论) the **\"Scripture of Dao and Virtue\"** (“道德”一经), treating it as **evidence for cultivating the self and establishing virtue/power** (修身立德之证). Before I knew it, **I had written page upon page** (不觉连篇累牍). Yet **their flaws were evident time and again** (第其瑕疵迭见), and **I found it hard to question such lofty minds** (殊难质诸高明).\n\nStill, **there were places where their thoughts aligned with the lofty subtleties of the Supreme One** (有与太上微意偶合处), and **their words did offer some small benefit to the world** (不无小补于世). My **friends urged me to edit and publish** (众友请付剞厥), **to make known to the world and future generations** (公诸天下后世). Though **I truly feel much shame in this annotation** (予于此注实多抱愧), I **do not dare deceive myself or others** (不敢自欺欺人).\n\nYet **I could not refuse their earnest entreaties** (无奈众友念切), so I **reluctantly agreed** (始诺其请). Now that this **publication is about to commence** (兹刊刻肇始), I **therefore set forth these few words at the beginning** (故弁数言于篇首), **to recount the origins of this annotation** (以叙此注之由来).\n\nWinter of the **10th year of Guangxu** (光绪十年孟冬月)\n**Dànyàn** (谷旦) **Huángjiǎn** (黄裳) **self-preface** (元吉自序)\n\n**Chapter One: The Gateway to All Marvels**\n\n**The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;**\n**The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.**\n\nBefore the naming of Heaven and Earth, there was the Nameless—\nThe origin of all ten thousand things.\nThus, **to observe its marvel through desirelessness,**\nAnd **to observe its subtleties through desire.**\n\nThese two, though differing in name, arise from the same source,\nAnd are called the **Mysterious**—\n**Mysterious beyond measure, the gateway to all marvels.**\n\nZhūzǐ said: *\"The Dao is like a path, shared by all.\"*\n\nIn truth, it is the principle by which **Heaven, Earth, and all beings are born.**\nBefore Heaven and Earth were divided, this Dao hung in the boundless void;\nAfter Heaven and Earth were opened, this Dao was entrusted to the realms of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhat Dao is this?\nIt existed before Heaven and Earth and endures eternally,\nIt follows after Heaven and Earth yet never decays.\nBorn before Heaven and Earth, it mingles within the void—\n**Neither visible nor audible.**\n\nThus, the Supreme One says:\n*\"Speaking of the Dao, it is subtle and hidden—*\n**Truly, there is no Dao to speak of.**\nWhat can be spoken of are but its manifestations,\nNot the eternal Dao itself.\"*\n\n*\"Speaking of names, they are empty and without substance—*\n**Truly, there is no name to speak of.**\nWhat can be named are but its dregs,\nNot the eternal Name itself.\"*\n\nIf one does not know the Dao,\n**How shall one observe it in the *Odes*?**\nIt says: *\"The carriage of Heaven moves—*\n**Without sound, without scent\"**—\n*The Dao cannot be grasped in words!*\n\nAgain it says: *\"The mandate of Heaven is solemn and unceasing\"**—\n*The Dao cannot be without designation.*\n\nKnow that within the **uttermost void,**\nThere exists the **uttermost reality;**\nWithin the **uttermost emptiness,**\nThere exists the **uttermost substance.**\n\nThe Dao is truly beyond what can be spoken of.\n\nThe Supreme One, in boundless compassion, taught the world:\nBefore the **Hóngmèng** stirrings, all was **indistinct and formless**—\nThough called *Nameless*, yet Heaven, Earth, and all beings are nurtured within it.\nThus, it is the **beginning of Heaven and Earth.**\n\nWhen stillness endured long enough,\nAnd **qi** moved with a pulse,\nThen came the **Namable**—\nA vast **Tàihé** breath of primordial qi,\nCirculating through the cosmos,\nNourishing all life.\nThus, it is the **mother of all things.**\n\n*Beginning* refers to the **cluster of primordial qi** before Heaven and Earth opened;\n*Mother* refers to the **transformation and birth of all things** after their division.\n\nFor the student at the outset,\nThere is no other method—\nOnly **sitting upright with a focused mind,**\n**Discarding all thoughts,**\n**Observing with a veiled gaze.**\n\nBeneath the heart, above the kidneys,\nThere seems a **void within the void.**\n**Spirit and qi** reflect each other,\n**Breath by breath, returning endlessly.**\nLet them **flow in and out naturally,**\nBut **concentrate both spirit and qi** in the **central palace** as the primary focus.\n\nIn no time, **spirit and qi merge as one.**\nThen, **listen to the indistinct murmur,**\n**Without a single conscious thought.**\nAfter long practice, **dimly aware,**\nOne enters the realm of **\"Where-Nothing-Is.\"**\n\nAt this moment,\nOne does not know if **spirit enters qi or qi returns to spirit**—\n**All is undifferentiated, beyond self and world, beyond place and Heaven,**\nYet not in **stupor**—\nFor if in stupor, one would become **a withered tree, cold ashes.**\n\nThe cultivator, having reached this point,\n**Must extinguish the stirring of thought,**\n**Yet preserve the luminous awareness.**\nOnly thus—**wise yet appearing foolish, enlightened yet not acting**—\nIn the instant of **no-knowing, no-awareness,**\nA sudden **awakening stirs,**\nAnd the **Tàijí** is established.\n\nKnow that within this **awakening,**\n**Spontaneous and unforced,**\nLies one’s **original true awareness.**\nThe Daoists call this the **Mysterious Gateway, the Subtle Aperture**—\nFound in **each inhalation and exhalation.**\n\nWhen inhaling, it is **yin, stillness, non-being;**\nWhen exhaling, it is **yang, motion, being.**\nEven in this **single breath,**\nThere lies a **subtle aperture.**\n\nIf one seeks **true awakening,**\nIt is in this **moment of awakening**—\nA **truly real, undeniably solid, thought-free, dross-free original self** that emerges.\n\nThus it is said:\n**Heaven and Earth awaken with this moment and give birth to ten thousand things;**\n**Humans awaken with this moment and forge the Golden Elixir.**\n\nBut this awakening is **like lightning and a spark—**\nPresent in the instant, yet gone in a blink.\nThe difference lies in **a hair’s breadth.**\n\nThe scholar must **discern this clearly in ordinary times**\nTo **grasp it firmly when the moment arises.**\n\nEven the **Great Awakened Ones** of old\nAchieved nothing beyond this **accumulation of awakening.**\n\nIf the cultivator does not begin with\n**Desirelessness and desire, observing marvel and aperture,**\nThen from where shall they establish their foundation?\n\nThough **non-being and being, marvel and aperture**\nAre but **yin-stillness and yang-motion**—\n**One breath divided into two breaths,**\nYet the two breaths still return to **one breath.**\n\nWhen stillness endures long enough and motion arises,\n**Non-being generates being—**\nCalled **\"One Yang is born, the Active Child.\"**\n\nWhen motion reaches its peak and returns to stillness,\n**Being returns to non-being—**\nCalled **\"Returning to the Root, restoring the Mandate.\"**\n\nAll are but the **divided yin and yang of the Supreme Ultimate.**\n\nThough differing in name,\nThey arise from **one source—**\nThe Supreme One calls it **Mysterious.**\n**Mysterious** means **profound and distant.**\n\nThe scholar who seeks the **Mysterious Dao**\nMust **be still again and again,**\n**Be steadfast yet again,**\nUntil within, **all is undisturbed—**\nThis is **observing marvel through desirelessness.**\n**The first Mysterious.**\n\nWhen **qi stirs and moves,**\nThough there is awareness, **no single thought arises;**\nThough there is motion, **no single notion lingers.**\n**One mind, no dual thoughts—**\nThis is **observing aperture through desire.**\n**The second Mysterious.**\n\nAs for **Mysterious beyond measure,**\nIt is truly the **return to the Root—**\nWhat else could be the **Gateway to All Marvels?**\n\nAlas, though common folk possess this **subtle aperture,**\nThey do not **nurture it directly,**\nThus it **opens and closes in vain,**\nUntil it is **exhausted without end.**\n\nThe **Perfect Sage**, when the **Mysterious Gateway** and **Aperture** open,\nFixes with **one gaze** and **one hand**—\n**Cultivates and nurtures** with **unremitting care,**\nNever allowing it to stray for an instant—\nThus **directly attaining** the **Supreme Root Source**,\nAnd **becoming** the **Great Awakened Golden Immortal.**\n\nThe **initial practice** lies within the **Mysterious Gateway** and **Aperture.**\nThe **First Chapter** of the *Taoist Canon* already points out\n**The Nameless and the Named,**\n**Observing Marvel through Desirelessness** and **Observing Aperture through Desire,**\nSufficiently revealing that **cultivation of the Dao**\nDeparts from nothing else but this **Mysterious Gateway** and **Aperture.**\nHence, the **opening four verses**\nSpeak of the **Great Dao’s Root Source**—\nTruly **formless and stateless,**\nBeyond **conception and exhaustive inquiry.**\n\nOnly in the **beginning of Heaven and Earth’s** unmanifested state,\n**Chaotic and indistinct,**\nWithout **any discernible trace,**\nIs it like when a person **directly nurtures** in **stillness.**\n\nAt the **moment Heaven and Earth suddenly split open,**\n**Stillness reaches its peak and motion begins,**\n**Awakening in an instant,**\nThis is when a person **discerns qi in movement**—\nThe **foundation** for **refining the elixir.**\n\nWithin **this fleeting glance,**\nWithout **the wisdom-pearl** or **the insight-sword,**\nOne cannot attain it.\n\nEssentially, **the moment thoughts arise** is the **Mysterious Feminine,**\nTruly the **beginning of Heaven’s splitting and Earth’s opening.**\nSince ancient times, **divine immortals and sages**\nHave all been **born from this moment of awakening and movement.**\n\nIt is also said:\n**\"Observing Marvel through Desirelessness,\"**\n**\"Observing Aperture through Desire,\"**\nThese two—**one still, one moving**—\nMutually **serve as their own roots,**\nThus **same in origin, yet different in name.**\n\nAll things with **form and likeness**\nCan be **grasped through contemplation and divination,**\nBut this **subtle aperture**—\n**Without yet present, present yet without,**\nCannot be **named or described by measure.**\n\nEven if the **tongue hangs like a suspended river,**\nIt cannot **utter a single word** of its truth—\nHence it is called **Mysterious beyond Mysterious.**\n\nThe scholar **must not regard it as distant and obscure,**\nYet **still fails to inquire** into its **concrete reality.**\n\nIf one **truly seeks it** in this **dim and hazy** state,\nWhile others see it as **flickering and vague,**\nFor oneself, it is **graspable and certain.**\n\nWith **time, practice brings forth vitality,**\nAnd **each step aligns with the Dao.**\n**Chapter Two: *Accomplishment without Dwelling***\n\nAll under Heaven know **beauty** as **beauty**—\nThen **ugliness** already arises;\nAll know **goodness** as **goodness**—\nThen **non-goodness** already appears.\n\nThus, **the presence and absence of forms** are **interdependent,**\n**Difficulty and ease** **complement each other,**\n**Length and shortness** **define one another,**\n**High and low** **lean toward equilibrium,**\n**Sounds and voices** **harmonize together,**\n**Before and after** **follow in sequence.**\n\nHence, the **Sage acts in non-doing,**\n**Practices speechless instruction,**\n**All things arise** yet **no claim is made,**\n**Life unfolds** yet **no possession is taken,**\n**Actions are done** yet **no credit is retained,**\n**Accomplishment is achieved** yet **no dwelling is taken;**\n**Only by not dwelling does it not depart.**\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"I urge you to exhaustively seek the origin of your vital body,\nReturning to the Root and Source—this is the Elixir Sage.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Exhaustively seek the origin of your vital body at the moment of receiving life,\nDo not blame the Heavenly Mechanism for being fully revealed.\"*\n\nFrom this perspective, it is clear that\nAt the **beginning of receiving life,**\n**Heaven’s principles** are **wholly manifest,**\nWithout **any flaw or blemish.**\nWhen they say **beauty** or **ugliness,**\n**Goodness** or **deformity,**\nThese are all **harmful to the Dao.**\n\nWhat is the **Great Dao** truly like?\nIn **Confucianism**, it is called **\"Hidden and Subtle\"**—\nWithin it lies the **essence of unseen and unheard.**\nIn **Buddhism**, it is called **\"That\"**—\nWithin it lies the **true reality of neither good nor evil.**\nIn **Daoism**, it is called **\"Mysterious Gateway\"**—\nWithin it lies the **depth of no thought and no deliberation.**\n\nThe **Great Dao’s Root Source**\nUltimately **originates from here.**\nOnce **imagined or conceptualized,**\nIt **falls into the trap of duality;**\nOnce **discussed or theorized,**\nIt **traps itself in the net of words.**\nThough **ancient sages and immortals**\nPraise the Dao’s **marvels** and say it is **beautiful** or **good,**\nThey all **flicker at its form**—\nNone truly **discern its essence.**\n\nFor **goodness** is **contrasted by evil,**\nAnd **beauty** is **contrasted by deformity.**\nMoreover, **beauty is present here, yet ugliness too;**\n**Goodness is present here, yet deformity too.**\nThis is **indeed the post-Heavenly interplay of yin and yang**—\n**With opposition, with victories and losses,**\nNot the **pre-Heavenly single primordial qi.**\n\nThus, the *Taoist Canon* says:\n*\"All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—\nThen ugliness already arises;\nAll know goodness as goodness—\nThen non-goodness already appears.\"*\n\nIt is known that **people do not seek the Dao’s formless qi,**\nBut only **speak of beauty as beauty, goodness as goodness**—\nThis is **abandoning the root for the branches.**\n\nThe *Taoist Canon* **specifically instructs** the **initial practice**,\nAnd **declares to the masses:**\nWhen a person **begins seated meditation,**\n**All thoughts must be released,**\n**The mind utterly empty,**\nNo **single affair** **interfering within the chest.**\n\nOnly then **lower the curtain and seal the mouth,**\n**Observe the formless elixir field**—\n**Concentrate the spirit** and **regulate the breath,**\n**Regulate the breath** and **concentrate the spirit,**\nThus, **with time, spirit and qi merge into one cluster,**\nAnd **in an instant** they **enter the distant void**—\nThis is **non-doing.**\n\nWhen **stillness reaches its utmost extreme,**\n**Suddenly, one awakens and moves**—\nThis is **doing.**\n\nFrom **this initial thought arising within the rules,**\n**Chaotic and continuous, surging and boundless,**\n**Spirit follows qi’s foundation, qi follows spirit’s motion,**\n**Without knowing yet knowing, without awareness yet aware,**\nThe **Gateway to the Mysterious Feminine** **stands revealed.**\n\nThus, **strictly adhering to the rules within the rules,**\n**Concentrating the spirit beyond the form,**\n**One breath in, one breath out,**\n**One forward, one backward,**\n**Qi must return to the Mysterious Aperture.**\n\n**Breathing follows naturalness**—\nThis is the **root of Heaven, Earth, and all beings,**\nThe **foundation of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,**\nThe **most secret heavenly mechanism** of our **Daoist School,**\n**Not to be lightly divulged.**\n\nFor **practitioners of the Dao,**\n**Better to seek it in yin and yang**—\n**More concrete and verifiable**—\nThan in the **indescribable void.**\n\n**The presence and absence of forms** **interdependently arise**—\nNothing more than **stillness giving way to movement,**\n**Movement giving way to stillness,**\n**Emerging from the Mysterious, entering the Feminine,**\n**Balancing the harmony of yin and yang.**\n\n**Difficulty and ease** **complement each other**—\nNothing more than **rigidity yielding to flexibility,**\n**Flexibility yielding to rigidity,**\n**Refining in the cauldron, tempering with the sword,**\n**One heating, one cooling.**\n\n**Length and shortness** **define one another**—\nThis is **breathing in and out,**\n**The governing and directing channels’ flow,**\n**The forward breath being short, the backward breath being long.**\n\n**High and low** **lean toward equilibrium**—\nThis is **fire above, causing it to descend,**\n**Water below, causing it to ascend,**\nThe **wondrous application** of **inversion and separation.**\n\n**Sound and voice harmonize**—\nThis is **spirit merging with qi**, **a hundred vessels flowing freely**,\nAs though a crane calls and the flock responds in unison—\nVoices in resonance, unsummoned yet arriving.\n\n**Front and back follow one another**—\nThis is **the Child racing behind**, **the Noon descending ahead**,\n**Heaven and Earth in union**, **harmonized as one mass**,\nClinging yet never parting.\n\nThese are all **returning the post-heaven yin-yang to the pre-heaven Non-Extreme**.\n\nThe Sage knows the **root of the Way**—\n**Vague and boundless, vast and untraceable**—\nIn governing affairs, **he prizes non-action**,\nAnd follows the **reverent self-restraint, the flowing robe** of old.\n\nIn teaching, **he takes silence as his principle**,\nAnd embodies the **subtle transformation of spirit-preservation**.\n\nThe Sage acts, and all things behold—\nWhat difficulty could there be?\n\nThus, **plowing fields and digging wells**,\nThey are born into life yet forget their own deeds;\n**Opening sources and regulating flow**,\nThey guide transformation yet erase their own traces.\n\nEven if their **virtue fills Heaven and Earth**,\nAnd their name resounds across the world,\nThe Sage would still **shun it as shameful**—\nFor empty fame has never borne real achievement.\n\nHow could it compare to the *Book of Documents* saying:\n*\"You alone do not boast, do not vaunt yourself—*\n*None under Heaven can contend with you in ability, in merit,\"*\nYet still **diminish the thought of human strife**?\n\nThis is surely the realm of **spirit-transformation**,\nThe **tranquil and settled heaven**,\nWhere one simply **finds contentment in self-sufficiency**,\nNever forgetting the **true essence of self-realization**.\n\nThe ancients spoke of **viewing wealth and nobility as fleeting clouds**,\nAnd **discarding fame like worn-out shoes**—\nIs this not what they meant?\n\nYet, **when the Way is complete, virtue stands firm**,\n**Achievement realized, name naturally follows**.\n\nThough the Sage does not claim merit,\nThe world and future ages **ceaselessly praise the Way**—\nThus, **without speaking of merit, merit matches sun and moon**,\n**Without speaking of name, name weighs heavier than antiquity**.\n\nOnly because **he does not dwell on it** does it not depart.\n\nStudents must **from the utmost emptiness and profound stillness**,\nNurture forth the **true essence of neither beauty nor goodness**,\nOnly then can cultivation have its foundation.\n\nWhat is this Way?\n**The Mysterious Pass**!\n\nAbandon this, and there is **no life**.\nThe cultivator, **abandoning this Mysterious Pass**,\nHas no other so-called Way.\n\nIf one takes **beauty and goodness as the Way**,\nIt is but **post-heaven dust and filth**.\n\nThe *Taoist Canon* warns of this,\nHoping people will **trace the source from the flow**.\n\nOtherwise, the praise of **beauty and goodness**\nIs also the virtue of the **gentlemen of the Three Dynasties**—\nHow could one blame them too severely?\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"One yin, one yang—this is the Way.\"*\nThus, **yang is not the Way**, **yin is not the Way**—\nThe Way lies **between yin and yang**!\n\nMoreover, the **Way is principle**, **yin and yang are qi**.\nPrinciple without qi cannot stand,\nQi without principle cannot move.\n\nTo speak of the Way alone is **formless and indescribable**,\nOnly when observed through **yin and yang’s manifestations**\nDoes it truly have **concrete evidence**.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the **true essence of neither goodness nor beauty**,\nDirectly **uncovering the root of the Great Way**,\nHoping people will **establish their foundation and set their extreme**,\nAs the basis for **cultivating the self and governing the world**.\n\nThe phrases on **ease and difficulty, presence and absence**\nTeach one to **return from opposing yin-yang to the true unity of qi**.\nWithin this, it also teaches one to **seek the Mysterious Pass**\nAs the **root of elixir-refining**.\n\nAs for **preserving the Center and nurturing the Elixir**,\n**The Child’s vitality thriving**, **turning the River-Chariot**—\nAll are **layered revelations**.\n\nOnly the Sage points directly to the source,\nThus **reverent self-restraint and non-action**,\n**Silent yet trusted**—\nThough there is **action and doing**, in oneself there is **no trace of virtue**.\n\nWhen achievement is complete and one retires,\nTo **view wealth and nobility as unworthy of weight**—\nWho but the Sage could attain this learning?\n\nStudents ponder and gain insight—\nNot only do they have a **foundation for practice**,\nBut also a **path to transcendence**.\n\nOther commentaries say:\n*\"All under Heaven know why beauty and goodness are beauty and goodness,*\n*Then they themselves will not do evil or wrong.\"*\nThis teaching is also correct.\n\nBut the *Taoist Canon* speaks mostly from the **source**,\nNot falling into the **Two Vehicles**.\n\n**Chapter Three:**\n*\"See no desirable things,*\n*Hold no virtue in high regard—*\n*Thus the people do not contend.*\n*Do not prize hard-to-obtain goods—*\n*Thus the people do not steal.*\n*See no desirable things—*\n*Thus the heart does not乱 (be disturbed).\"*\n\nTherefore, the Sage’s governance—\n**Empty their minds, fill their bellies,**\n**Weaken their wills, strengthen their bones,**\n**Always keep the people in ignorance and desirelessness,**\nSo that even the wise **dare not act**.\n\n**Non-action**—\nThen there is **nothing left ungoverned**.\n\nThe Sage’s governance of the world—\n**Better to do nothing than to act,**\nAnd even better to **act without acting**.\n\nIn transforming the people and establishing customs—\n**Better to transform than to influence,**\nAnd even better to **let them rest in harmony without disturbance**.\n\nThus, **Yao and Shun**, with **reverent self-restraint and flowing robes**,\nBrought **the Four Quarters into order**—\nWhat **principle of transformation** was this?\n\nIt was simply:\n**The ruler’s lack of scheming made the people still,**\n**The ruler’s lack of desire made the people upright,**\n**The ruler’s lack of greed made the people settled.**\n\nOtherwise, **busy and agitated**,\nThey believe they are **benefiting the people and removing their hardships**,\nYet **they do not realize how greatly they disturb them**.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The people originally do not contend—*\n*Yet the ruler provokes contention.*\n*The people originally are not greedy—*\n*Yet the ruler’s greed incites them.*\n*The people originally have no thoughts, no desires—*\n*Yet the ruler leads with strange arts, licentious cleverness,*\n*Gay clothing, and fine foods.\"*\n\nHow could they **not contend, not be greedy, have no cravings, no desires**?\n\nIf one **cultivates the self and rectifies the heart**,\n**Serene and unadorned, indifferent to all things**,\nAnd **does not hold virtue and ability in high regard**,\nThen the people **will naturally be at ease and not contend**.\n\nIf one **does not prize hard-to-obtain goods as noble**,\nThen the people **will value modesty and shame**,\nAnd **will not steal**.\n\nMoreover, the **arenas of sound, color, wealth, and profit** are many—\nFor the eyes, **see nothing, desire nothing**,\nAnd **each finds their own natural ease**—\nThen the **empty, responsive, lively spirit**\n**Naturally remains ever-present and undisturbed**.\n\nThis matter is not beyond human capacity—\nOnly the Sage shuts out ear and eye,\nSevers all private inclinations,\nEmbraces the One to empty the heart.\nWhen the heart is empty, the elixir’s source is refined.\n\nThus, he gathers the **Dao’s luminous yang-qi** from heaven and earth,\nTo transform the yin-essence,\nDay by day, month by month,\nUntil the yin-essence naturally vanishes\nAnd the yang-qi flourishes—\nFilling the belly to preserve the form,\nThis is **congealing the body with the Way**,\n**prolonging life with technique**—\nThe very method of transcending death and escaping birth.\n\nMoreover, by focusing the qi to attain supreme softness,\nLike an infant’s feeble strength,\nUnable to grasp anything—\nThough supremely soft,\nYet when it moves, it is firm.\nObserve its vast and deep, towering and surging—\nTruly it can encompass heaven and earth with ease.\nAll knowing and desiring—\nWhere has it gone?\n\nThe Sage cultivates himself thus.\nAnd with this, he governs the world—\nWithin himself, no knowledge, no desire—\nNot only do the foolish wander in muddled confusion,\nIn harmony with the silent and tranquil heaven,\nBut even the clever and wise scholars,\nWho daily boast of their talents and rely on their intelligence,\nFearful only of failing to excel—\nNow, serene and indifferent, they abandon their private knowledge,\nReturning to primordial simplicity.\nThis is *able but does not act*—\nNot because they cannot, but because they dare not.\n\nYet, though born between heaven and earth,\nOne cannot escape the void\nAnd stand apart from all things—\nThere must be the Way of human relationships and daily practice.\nHow then can one *not* act?\n\nBut if one follows its natural course,\nActing without contrivance—\nThough one acts, it remains non-action—\nJust as heaven acts without speaking yet transforms all,\nAnd the seasons proclaim their teachings without command;\nThe Emperor governs without action,\nWhile ministers administer the affairs.\nAction is its trace,\nNon-action is its essence.\nThus, seated in majesty, the world rejoices in peace—\nAh, how splendid!\n\nThe Way is ever plain,\nNot vaunting novelty,\nNot prizing strangeness.\nWhen a state honors the virtuous—\nThis is a noble thing,\nYet if one boasts of it,\nThen the virtuous remain virtuous,\nBut the unworthy will also feign virtue.\nEven the virtuous may reject what is rejected,\nWhile the unworthy reject what is virtuous—\nThus, contention arises.\nEach side proclaims its own merits,\nMutually supporting factions,\nAnd the world becomes troubled.\n\nWhen a state manages finances—\nThis is a common practice,\nYet if rare goods and distant treasures are prized,\nThe people will scale mountains and cross seas,\nRisking peril and danger,\nUndeterred by toil or fear for life,\nTo gather and present them to the court.\nWhen they fail to obtain them,\nThey resort to every scheme—\nEven theft and robbery are not shunned.\n\nAs for clothing and food—\nThese are daily necessities,\nYet if one demands exquisite delicacies\nAnd fine silks,\nSeeing what is desirable and desiring it—\nWhen will extravagance cease?\n\nThus, the Sage values the inner over the outer,\nMust empty the heart to nourish the spirit,\nFill the belly to nourish the qi,\nSo that spirit and qi merge as one,\nFlowing harmoniously through the body—\nSmooth, relaxed, and joyful,\nAnd the will grows weak.\nMoreover, the spirit steadies like a mountain,\nThe qi flows like a spring,\nAnd the bones grow strong.\nEver holding to the One,\nEver guarding the Center—\nNot only is one’s own desire and thought extinguished,\nBut even the clever and wise,\nMoved by this, transform themselves,\nDaring not to act arbitrarily.\n\nSome say: *If one acts, there will be chaos and criticism;\nIf one does not act, there will be purity but scorn.*\nBetween action and non-action—\nThis is difficult indeed.\n\nYet to act in accordance with principle,\nNot presumptuously—\nAction and non-action are equal.\nThus, Confucius praised Shun:\n*\"He who governs by non-action—\nIs this not Shun?\"*\n\n**Chapter Four: Blending with the Dust**\n\nThe Way is boundless yet applied—\nSometimes not full,\nDeep like the source of all things.\nIt dulls the sharp,\nUnravels the tangled,\nBlends its light,\nMerges with the dust.\nMysterious—\nAs if it exists.\nI do not know whose child it is,\nResembling the Emperor before the beginning.\nThe Emperor—\nThe Supreme Sovereign.\nThe beginning—\nThe beginningless beginning.\n\nWhat is the Way?\nThe Great Harmony, one breath,\nFilling heaven and earth,\nIts measure encompassing the cosmos,\nIts spirit permeating past and future,\nIts virtue extending to all lands and nations.\nFrom embryonic to born, from wet to dry,\nFrom flying to creeping, from moving to still—\nThere is nowhere it is not.\n\nHow vast is the Way?\n\nYet in its essence,\nEmpty and boundless,\nFormless and void—\nIf unseen, it seems excessive;\nWhen it manifests in use,\nIt is harmonious and embraced—\nApplied here, it fits;\nPlaced there, it is appropriate.\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"Left, left—nothing is unsuited;\nRight, right—nothing is lacking.\"*\nTruly like rivers flowing to the sea,\nYet the sea does not overflow.\nIs this not the fundamental principle of all things?\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"The virtue of ghosts and spirits—\nIt rests upon all things without omission.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Speak of small things without exaggeration,\nSpeak of great things without omission.\"*\nIts vast and deep—\nTruly there is an inexhaustible mystery.\n\nThe Way is so difficult to describe—\nHow then shall later generations cultivate it?\n\nThe Most High, compassionate toward ordinary people,\nPoints to its essence:\nOrdinary people cannot enter the Way\nBecause the clever and wise,\nRelying on their talents,\nAct arbitrarily,\nThus blocking the luminous spirit\nAnd failing to see.\n\nNow, to cultivate the Way,\nOne must know that cleverness and wisdom\nAre demons that obstruct the path.\nThus, one must discard intelligence,\nDim the brightness,\nSet aside private perceptions of ear and eye,\nReturning to primordial chaos,\nAnd extinguish all arrogance of talent,\nAll reliance on cleverness,\nAll haughtiness toward others—\nThen the human heart dies,\nAnd the Dao-heart is born.\nKnowledge is extinguished,\nAnd wisdom shines forth.\n\nThe ancient scholars said: Those with cleverness and talent are not to be feared—only those who sink deeply into the Way, purify the heart, and observe its principles are truly formidable. Is this not the truth?\n\nPractitioners must primarily focus on calming the spirit, refining thoughts, reducing desires, and clarifying the heart. Yet how can one tame the restless mind—awareness, thought, and calculation—where foul and false impulses surge like tangled silk? Before one thought subsides, another arises; before one reflection fades, another emerges. I must exhort and encourage myself, granting myself both leniency and resolution—like unraveling chaotic threads, I must trace their origins and straighten them; like clearing overgrown vines, I must uproot them and level the ground. Only then do the entanglements dissolve, and the celestial sovereign remains ever serene.\n\nYet this is but the practice of solitary stillness—still far from thriving in tumultuous places. If one can only be still and not move, it remains a rootless study. One must also reflect in stillness, but when thrust into bustling crowds, one must be especially vigilant! In all things, yield precedence to others, place yourself last, exalt others above, and willingly submit below. Thus, you will neither clash with the world nor contend with people.\n\nMoreover, men delight in the same while loathing the different—this is the common nature of the world. I must only follow the current, align with their kind, and harmonize with them. Though I possess a luminous and upright heart, I will never display its edges. I must only intuitively grasp its mechanisms, subtly uphold its essence—cherishing those who agree, tolerating those who differ. Hence, the man of Lu who hunted deer, and Confucius himself who hunted deer. In ancient times, when the Great Way was yet unclear, all sages blended with the vulgar to avoid harm.\n\nAgain, observe the Sixth Patriarch after receiving the robe and bowl—though his enlightenment was complete, its subtleties remained unexhausted. Thus, he lingered in the world, dwelling in Huìjì Mountain, living among hunters with unfeigned ease, escaping calamity. Had he not harmonized with the dust and blended with the mundane, how could he have preserved his life?\n\nThrough dynamic and static cultivation, ever-adapting with expedient means, the originally pure, still, and luminous essence naturally abides within. Yet it is not a fixed attainment—if it were fixed, it would not be the Way. If it had a place or abode, it would not be the Way. A single pulse of luminous spirit flickers beneath the golden court. What is this Way?\n\nIt arises before Heaven and Earth, mingling within the void. I know not whence it comes, nor whither it goes—whose child is it? The *Classic* says: *\"There is a primal thing, indistinctly formed, born before Heaven and Earth.\"* Is this not the profound mystery of the Way?\n\nWhat was before the Emperor? Nothing but the undifferentiated chaos, the indistinct *Hóngmáng*, a single breath of emptiness. When the One gave rise to myriad transformations and all things returned to spring, the Way dispersed through Heaven, Earth, and all beings—yet it remains inscrutable. Those who seek to illuminate the Way’s essence must perceive it in the moment when Heaven and Earth are on the verge of unfolding, when the unfurled suddenly unfurls, and measure it. Then they grasp the Way’s origin, and their practice will not lack foundation.\n\nThe Most High sketches the Way’s form for all to see, teaching those who seek the Great Way to first recognize its source. To seek the source, one must first purge deceit from the heart and preserve sincerity, beginning with humble, gradual cultivation. Over time, one attains the realm of divine transformation, realizing that the Way’s essence dwells perpetually within one’s nature, never leaving the embrace.\n\nOne must discern its traces in stillness, using cultivation, reflection, and preservation to safeguard true nature—neither overwhelming others with arrogance nor confusing the mind with excess. This is what Zhāng Zǐ called \"liberating oneself from private desires.\"\n\nPiercing the clouds, one beholds the blue sky; severing the vines, one reveals the true face. Yet when interacting with others, some bury their light, blending with the dust; some flaunt their talents or abilities; others assume the guise of recluse, displaying lofty detachment. History shows many who, through such displays, invited disaster and ruin—great harm to the Way. Like the Han dynasty’s imprisonment of scholars or the Jin dynasty’s persecution of the \"pure currents,\" though rooted in petty treachery, it also stemmed from ignorance of the sage’s art of self-preservation.\n\nIf one blends with the vulgar, harmonizes with the world, and mingles with the dust like the *lingzhī* among common grasses or the phoenix flying with common birds—unnoticed yet fragrant, unseen yet exalted—then, through such concealment and nurturing, the still and eternal Way manifests indistinctly between the brows: present yet not present, with form yet without form.\n\nAs the *Zhōngyōng* says: *\"The movements of Heaven are soundless and odorless.\"* Truly profound! What else could be before the Emperor?\n\n---\n**Chapter Five: Not Knowing to Uphold the Middle**\n\nHeaven and Earth are not kind—they treat all things as sacrificial dogs.\nThe sage is not kind—they treat the people as sacrificial dogs.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet unyielding, moving yet ever producing.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—better to uphold the Middle.\n\nThe ceaseless generation and transformation between Heaven and Earth, its unrestrained motion, is entirely governed by this primal *qi*, sustaining all within. It supports Heaven above, Earth below, and connects with all beings, leaving nothing outside its sway.\n\nWhen this *qi* is undifferentiated and vast, governing all things in orderly harmony, it is called *lǐ* (principle).\nWhen it flows boundlessly, encompassing all things in its transformative circulation, it is called *qi*.\nThe unity of *lǐ* and *qi* is called *rén* (virtue/power).\n\nThus, the ancient scholars said: *\"The virtuous one, with all human desires purified, allows Heaven’s principle to flow freely—without a trace of artificial contrivance.\"*\n\nIt is also said: *\"To generate and transform is called virtue/power.\"*\n\nIn essence, the virtuous one is like the *rén* (virtue/power) of wood—its generative principle and *qi* are fully present.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate all things, the Sage nourishes all people—none of this is achieved without the *lǐ* (principle) and *qi* flowing through them. How could it be merely a matter of outward actions?\n\nThus, the Supreme Sage spoke to elucidate the Dao: *\"If Heaven and Earth lacked this vital generative *qi*, and only had the teachings of spring, summer, autumn, winter, cold, heat, warmth, and coolness to circulate and regulate, then all things would have no foundation to draw upon—how could *qi* be received, how could form be established? They would be regarded as lightly as straw dogs, utterly unworthy of regard, only to be seen gradually worn away.*\n\n*If the Sage lacked this true primordial essence, and relied solely on ministers and officials, decrees, and legal codes to instruct the common people, then the rural masses would have no means of enlightenment—how could people be transformed, how could families be sustained? Truly, they would be treated as contemptibly as straw dogs, utterly indifferent to their plight, only to see them gradually crushed.*\n\n*Yet how is it that Heaven and Earth, though without intent, encompass all things within their wind, clouds, rain, and dew? How is it that the Sage, though silent, assists and completes all things, and all take delight within the world? It is evident that both Heaven and Earth and the Sage rely on this primal *qi*, permeating among the people and all things—though there may be exploitation, there is also generation; though there may be coercion, there is also moral cultivation. It is precisely the apparent lack of virtue/power in Heaven, Earth, and the Sage that reveals their ultimate virtue/power.*\n\n*If people do not recognize the Sage, let them observe Heaven and Earth: above, it floats as Heaven; below, it condenses as Earth. Within, it is empty yet luminous, boundless yet without obstruction—nothing more than an opening and closing, like the bellows’ endless breath and the flute’s resonant flow, vast and unrestrained. When it is empty and without form, it follows the *qi*’s rise and fall, unyielding yet flexible. When it moves and becomes sound, it responds to the transformations of all things, ever producing the extraordinary.*\n\n*To observe Heaven and Earth is to see the bellows and flute. How could the Sage be any different?*\n\n*Scholars who uphold the Middle and embrace the One, empty yet without trace, vast yet without end—when they conceal it deeply, its manifestation is boundless. Compared to those who fill halls with speech and rooms with doctrine, the difference is as vast as heaven and earth. The former sets teachings by speech, exhausting them in instruction—how could it compare to treasuring our essence, enriching our *qi*, wandering beyond form, and letting *qi* circulate through every pore?*\n\n*Truly, the study of the Middle is the essential path to cultivating the self. This is the primal *qi*—cultivating the self lies here, governing the world lies here. Beyond this, so-called institutions and laws are but the traps and snares for catching fish and rabbits. Fish and rabbits must rely on traps and snares to be obtained, yet to say they cannot be caught without them is wrong, and to say the traps and snares *are* the fish and rabbits is equally wrong.*\n\n*The Great Dao is like supplementing yin with yang—short steps forward, long steps back; the small return of jade nectar, the great return of golden nectar—all are but traps and snares for catching fish and rabbits. If one mistakenly takes them for the source of the Dao, even a hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand miles of deviation.*\n\n*Only this primal *qi*—silent, odorless, formless, the shared generative *qi* of Heaven, Earth, and all beings—must be sought by the scholar in cultivation. Only then will they not engage in empty refining. Otherwise, refining essence, *qi*, spirit, and emptiness are all studies without foundation. Even if practiced from childhood, one will remain unaccomplished to old age.*\n\n*The Supreme Sage teaches one to focus on the Middle: the key lies in the bellows and flute—students must explore this themselves! The phrase *\"not virtue/power\"* in this chapter is rhetorical.*\n\n**Chapter Six: The Unending Spirit of the Valley**\nThe unending Spirit of the Valley is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nEnduring yet unexhausted, its use is effortless.\n\nCultivation is but this: because humans have a body, *qi* and nature are constrained ahead, desires obscure behind—like pure gold and fine jade, originally without flaw, yet when plunged into mud, the finest gold loses its purity, the finest jade its luster. Thus, to restore their original state, one must employ the force of washing and the skill of polishing.\n\nThe Supreme Sage instructs the starting point of cultivation: *\"The Spirit of the Valley does not die.\"* What is the Spirit of the Valley? A mountain cave is called a valley, speaking of its emptiness; unrestrained transformation is called spirit, speaking of its vitality. \"Not dying\" means ever-awake and unobscured.\n\nIf one can nourish this empty, vital, and unobscured body as the foundation, then cultivation becomes easy. Yet it is formless and shadowless, impossible to grasp—only through the seen and heard can one glimpse its traces.\n\nThe ancients said: *\"To make the Spirit of the Valley never die, one must establish the foundation in the Mysterious Female.\"* Why is it called Mysterious? Mysterious is Heaven. Why is it called Female? Female is Earth. Heaven and Earth unite, and the Mysterious Female emerges; the Mysterious Female emerges, and opening-closing is complete. Between them, one ascends and one descends, one goes and one returns, revolving within the void—this is the gate of the Mysterious Female.\n\nConfucius said, *\"The *Kàn* and *Kūn* are the gate of the *Yì*.\"* Is this not true?\n\nThis gate is the path of yin and yang, the realm of Heaven and Earth’s transformation, the place where all things originate. To follow it is the door of death; the Sage inverts it, making it the gate of life.\n\n「To cultivate the elixir (*dàn*) and achieve the Dao/Way of eternal life and prolonged vision, one must not abandon this gate of the Mysterious Female—there is no other path.\n\nWhat else could be the root of Heaven and Earth? When practitioners (*xiūshì*) hang the curtain and observe with contemplation, in the state of ignorance and chaos, they must extinguish the mundane mind (*fánxīn*). Suddenly, with one awakening, the Dao/Way-mind (*dàoxīn*) is born.\n\nWhat is called \"stillness\" is the Original Spirit (*yuánshén*), and what is called \"movement\" is the True Intention (*zhēnyì*). Within this, the *tāixī* breath stirs—do not rigidly cling to the *dāntián* (elixir field); instead, observe its ascent and descent, its coming and going, its leisurely and lively flow, and one attains the true *tāixī* breath.\n\nThe ancients said: *\"To emerge from the Mysterious and enter the Female\"*—this is neither the original face of the self nor the true face of the self. Only in this space of emerging and entering does the marvelous *dì* (truth/essence) reside, which is the *qí* and *líng* (emptiness and responsiveness) of the Dao/Way.\n\nThe True Yin and True Yang, manifesting as the *qi* of True Unity (*zhēnyī*), are the essence here. The root of Heaven and Earth—could it lie beyond this?\n\nIt must be known that the Spirit of the Valley (*gǔshén*) is the principle (*lǐ*) of the Supreme Ultimate (*tàijí*); the Mysterious Female is the *qi* of yin and yang. In the preheaven (*xiāntiān*) state, principle and *qi* were originally one; in the postheaven (*hòutiān*) state, principle and *qi* cannot be spoken of together.\n\nThose who seek the Dao/Way must not indulge in a single moment of agitation or neglect a single thought. Only by borrowing the void of the Mysterious Female to nurture the emptiness and responsiveness of the Valley Spirit—neither clinging nor rejecting, neither forgetting nor aiding—can one attain it.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Endless as if it exists, use it without strain.\"* The Great Dao/Way is formless yet gives birth to Heaven and Earth; the Great Dao/Way is nameless yet brings forth all things.\n\nThe Sage, embodying the Dao/Way while appearing formless and manifesting the Dao/Way while appearing empty, reveals this most hidden and subtle essence as the Valley Spirit. The Valley Spirit—this God of the Void Valley—when questioned, seems to answer; when responded to, echoes like a sound—this is immortality (*bùsǐ*).\n\nIn the human body, it is the unobscured essence of this emptiness and responsiveness. Since humans lost their innate Heavenly conscience (*tiānhuì*), the Valley Spirit has long been submerged and obscured!\n\nLater practitioners, wishing to preserve the Valley Spirit eternally and maintain its emptiness and responsiveness, consider it the foundation of the Golden Elixir (*jīndān*) and the root of the Dao/Way of transcendence (*xiāndào*), yet they revolve in vain without a handle.\n\nOnly by seeking the Dao/Way through the interplay of *wu* (non-being) and *yǒu* (being), observing the marvelous and the subtle, can one begin. When being and non-being are balanced, the marvelous and subtle open together, and the Mysterious Female stands revealed.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"This orifice is not an ordinary orifice,\nHeaven and Earth together form it.\nIt is called the God-Spirit Hole (*shénqìxué*),\nWithin it lies the *Kàn* and *Lǐ* essence (*kānlí jīng*).\n\"* Only when essence (*jīng*), *qi*, and spirit (*shén*) are fused into one does it become the marvelous orifice of being and non-being, the gate of life and death.\n\nOtherwise, it remains an ordinary orifice, lacking the true One Primordial *qi* (*yīyuán zhēnzǎi*). When empty, it falls into coarse void; when solid, it is bound by form—both are not the body of emptiness and responsiveness.\n\nOnly this gate of the Mysterious Female—neither empty nor solid, yet both empty and solid—holds the true being that cannot be spoken of. Stillness is formless; movement has manifestations. Stillness is not the root of Heaven and Earth; movement is not the origin of all things.\n\nOnly where stillness and movement intersect is the place of the *Kàn* and *Lǐ* reversal, the realm of the Moon and Sun’s interplay—this is the true root of Heaven and the womb of Earth.\n\nWhen the student reaches the true Mysterious and true Female, with each ascent and descent—this *qi* condenses into nature (*xìng*), disperses into emotions (*qíng*)—from the state of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, the *dharma* (phenomena/manifestations) emerge.\n\nKnowing this orifice, the entire Dao/Way of immortality and transcendence is exhausted here.\n\n*\"Endless as if it exists\"*—this makes clear that nourishment must be prolonged, and only then will the *tāixī* breath stir and move.\n*\"Use it without strain\"*—this means that extraction and replenishment have their proper times, and the *fǔhuǒ* (alchemical fire) must not be recklessly added or diminished.\n\nIf humans follow the natural Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth, then the Golden Elixir will be attained.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven Endures, Earth Lasts**\nHeaven endures, Earth lasts.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can endure and last is that they do not generate themselves—thus they can eternally generate.\n\nTherefore, the Sage places his body after his body, yet his body comes first; he externalizes his body, yet his body remains. Is this not because he has no selfishness?\n\nOnly because he has no selfishness can he fulfill his selfishness. The *qi* of Heaven and Earth flows boundlessly and eternally, enduring countless eons without exhaustion—all because of the silent operation of the true One Primordial Sovereign (*yuánzhě*) within them. Thus Heaven and Earth endure and last without end.\n\nIn generating and nurturing all things, in prolonging the lives of the myriad peoples, they do so without ceasing—yet Heaven and Earth have never been insufficient. Thus the *qi*-mechanism (*qìjī*) endures eternally without wear.\n\nThe Supreme Sage says, *\"Heaven endures, Earth lasts\"*—is this not true?\n\nYet why can Heaven and Earth endure and last? It is because they do not generate themselves. If they had a self-generating mind, then Heaven and Earth would have emotions, and Heaven too would age.\n\nOnly by not having self-generation can they generate all things, and by generating all things, their own generation never ceases. Thus the generation of all things is the generation of Heaven and Earth—this is called eternal generation.\n\nThe common people are mostly ignorant of this principle of generation, seeking death instead of life, seeking swift death instead of eternal life. They drown in the fields of power and wealth, sink in the depths of sound, color, profit, and gain.\n\nThey constantly calculate, endlessly scheme—before a few years pass, their essence is exhausted, their *qi* weakened, their vitality scattered, their spirit lost. They toil through countless hardships yet struggle to enjoy even one lifetime.\n\nSeeking life while actually hastening death—how can this be lamented enough!\n\nThus the Sage follows Heaven and models Earth, refusing to chase after power and wealth, yet also not greedily pursuing the arts of prolonging life and increasing longevity. Only the Great Dao/Way comes first.\n\nHe clears the field of his heart, purifies it, and meticulously cultivates the root of his life (*mìngdì*). Whatever means of nourishing the body or refining the form exist, he does not spare time to contrive them.\n\nIn the end, his virtue (*dé*) is established, and none of his kind surpasses him; his name is made, and later generations still look up to his form.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Endless as if it exists, use it without strain.\"*\n\nThe Sage is not one who neglects his own body while it thrives, nor who forsakes his own body while it yet remains. Truly, he far surpasses those who selfishly harm their own lives a hundredfold.\n\nYet the Sage is not one who feigns emotions or stands apart for show. Since ancient times, simplicity and tranquility have been his virtues—clear and pure in heart, never floating with the crowd nor clinging to form. He stands firm in great impartiality, like Heaven and Earth in their boundless generosity.\n\nMortals are often self-seeking, burdened with cares; the Sage holds no private thoughts, his spirit bright and detached beyond all things. A single radiant essence of emptiness and boundless void, ever-shining yet never dimmed.\n\nWere it but a mortal frame of flesh and blood, a stinking skin-bag, constantly fretted over day and night—how could it ever remain whole and not decay, enduring and not perish? It is only through his impartiality that the Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth, shines like the sun and moon, and yet fulfills his own purpose.\n\nLater seekers of the Dao/Way, desiring their bodies to be immortal and their spirits unbroken, though they toil in austerity, cast off defilements, and refine themselves through long practice—naturally pure and clear, another realm of Heaven and Earth, beyond worldly life and death—how could such joy be surpassed?\n\nHeaven and Earth speak not; they rely solely on the primal *qi* of unity, circulating effortlessly between them. Thus they renew endlessly, their vital force never ceasing. Because Heaven and Earth endure eternally, they remain ever fresh across the ages.\n\nThe Sage harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, nurturing the *qi* of Great Unity, returning to the primal truth of chaos. In seclusion, his virtue becomes sublime; in action, it becomes the Way of the Sage-King.\n\nWhat are the words of those who speak of self-cultivation? They seek only lonely mountains and silent sitting, never touching the affairs of men. And those who claim to govern the world? They expend all their energy and effort, their entire being entangled in calculations for others!\n\nSuch men cling to one extreme or another, each to their own private ends. They are not those who are still in quietude, nor those who act with purpose and clarity.\n\nThe Sage in adversity remains pure and untainted, his true form steadfast as mountains and rivers. In prosperity, he benefits all, his mortal form as light as a fleeting title.\n\nWhen his name is known throughout the cosmos and his body stands alone before all ages—when his virtue covers the world and his essence persists beyond this life—is it not because he held nothing private?\n\nThe student who casts off all selfishness, empties the illusions of form, and forever escapes the roots of dust—his accumulated virtue will dwell in the mortal world, and his ascension will endure in Heaven and Earth. To reject self-interest and yet attain true longevity is as different from the worldly as the heavens from the mud.\n\nWho can truly abandon the allure of external desires?\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Virtue is Like Water**\n\nThe supreme virtue is like water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\ndwelling where others find revulsion,\nthus approaching the Dao/Way.\n\nIts place is humble, its heart deep,\nits words trustworthy, its governance wise,\nits actions effective, its movements timely.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\ndoes it suffer no blame.\n\nThe Great Dao/Way has no other mystery—\nonly the union of spirit and *qi*,\nreturning to the boundless *Tai Ji*,\nthe single breath of life given by parents at birth.\n\nIf one does not attend to the Dao/Way,\nthen spirit and *qi* are divided,\nlike lead and mercury scattered—\nfor water and fire are thus separated.\n\nMencius said: *\"The people are not nourished by water and fire, they cannot live.\"*\nThis applies both to daily needs\nand to the essentials of cultivation.\n\nSometimes fire warms water, and true yang manifests;\nsometimes water sustains fire, and sweet dew arises.\nThe marvels of water and fire\nare truly beyond measure.\n\nYet water and fire share the same essence—\nspeak of water, and fire is known.\n\nWater’s nature is to descend;\nthe Dao/Way values humility.\nThus the Sage of supreme virtue\nis even-tempered, his will gentle and yielding,\nletting all things flourish in their own time—\nnone escape his beneficence.\n\nIn truth, his virtue covers the world yet he knows not of it,\nhis actions fill the cosmos yet he claims them not.\nOnly by following Heaven and Earth’s natural order,\nfulfilling the place of all things,\ndoes he remain without conflict—\ntruly like water in its boundless nourishment.\n\nNot only this—\nall things prefer clarity to turbidity,\nelevation to descent.\nWater cleanses all things yet keeps itself impure,\nserves others with elevation yet humbles itself below.\nAh, water! Water!\nHow perfectly it mirrors the Dao!\n\nThe Sage’s nature is one with water’s—\ngentle, not rigid,\nhumble in self-giving.\nWhat others cannot endure, the Sage accepts as ever-present;\nwhat others most abhor, the Sage bears with ease.\nThus he harms none, nor does he contend with any.\nNone but the Sage of the Dao/Way can do so.\nHence it is said: *\"Dwelling where others find revulsion, he approaches the Dao.\"*\n\nWhat the Dao/Way offers to oneself\nis to occupy one’s natural place and move without hindrance.\nEven in matters of gain or loss,\ncalamity or death—\nwhat others cannot bear—\nthe Sage of the Dao/Way views all with equal measure.\n\nThe gentleman speaks of principle, not *qi*;\ndiscusses nature, not fate—\nonly the cultivation of virtue and self-reflection matter.\n\nStill, virtue arises from unity,\nand its refinement follows many paths.\nHow could it be without a guiding source,\nvast and boundless,\nyet grounded in an ultimate foundation?\n\nThere must be a realm of supreme goodness,\nwhere it rests without shifting,\nonly then can it grow subtly yet steadily,\nas Heaven’s truth fills the day,\nand human desires fade.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"The mountain stands firm, its back unyielding, yet it does not harm its own body. It moves within its courtyard, yet none see its person.\"*\nThis is the Sage’s humble dwelling.\n\nTo dwell in peace is to draw from its depth.\nTo gaze inward at his heart—\nempty, yet holding nothing—\ndeep as the abyss, yet deeper still.\n\n「Externally observing what is granted,\nselecting worthy individuals for association—\nthis is the depth of his benevolence.\n\nWhen it comes to his words,\na thousand gold pieces are not worth a single promise,\nfor *\"speech is trustworthy\"* (言善信).\nIn governing affairs,\ngreat kindness is inferior to great virtue,\nfor *\"good governance brings order\"* (政善治).\nExtending this to all things—\nwhether matter, deed, movement, or stillness—\nhe finds the Dao in every detail.\n\nAssigning tasks to others,\nhe only expects them not to fail in their capacity.\nActing with kindness in motion,\nhe merely seeks that action aligns with its proper time.\n\nThus the Sage cultivates himself and governs the world in this manner.\nThis arises from *\"resting at supreme goodness\"* (止于至善),\nfinding his place of ease,\nand then all his actions conform to proper measure.\n\nFor in every moment and place,\nthere is no slightest flaw or deficiency—\nwhat need is there for contention?\n\nOnly when one does not contend,\ndoes humanity respond with gratitude and reverence,\nengraved in bone and mind—\nthis is the Sage’s unyielding gaze,\nand where could resentment or blame arise?\n\nEven the wicked are transformed into the good.\n\nWhen his virtue reaches its peak,\nhe acts without effort, naturally,\nall resting in the unknowing, unseeing Heaven.\nNearly forgetting the water-like goodness of supreme virtue,\ngentle yet firm, unerring—\nno path is unlucky.\n\nPointing to the heart of supreme goodness,\never plain and ordinary,\nneither fond nor hateful,\nvast and boundless,\nwithout bias or tilt,\nperfectly harmonious and yielding.\n\nThus, though elevated, he is not arrogant;\nthough lowly, he does not betray.\nToward himself, no blame;\ntoward others, no grievance.\n\nYet, what makes this possible?\nIt is not the learning of the common world that can reach its heights,\nnor the hollow studies without root that can establish its foundation.\n\nTherefore, the highest Sage dwells in the realm most reviled by the crowd,\nthen reveals a place of goodness.\nUltimately, what is this place?\nIt is the *inch-deep sincerity of the heart* (寸衷寸地).\n\nTo attain this place is to have life and nature as a support;\nto lose it is to have spirit and *qi* without master.\n\nWithout a master, there is chaos—\nhow could all things be in harmony,\nuniting inner and outer,\nand acting in self and others without contention?\n\nStill, if one says this place *exists*,\none risks falling into rigid attachment;\nif one says it *does not exist*,\none stumbles into dull emptiness.\n\nThis is likely the realm where existence and nonexistence are not fixed,\nand motion and stillness are not constrained.\n\nTo cultivate the supreme Dao,\none must carefully examine its essence—\naccumulate abundant *yin* merit (多积阴功),\nbroadly promote virtuous deeds (广敦善行),\nand perhaps ascend to divine Heaven (上格神天),\nor gain guidance from a teacher (或得师指),\nor awaken through divine insight (或因神悟),\nthus attaining understanding of this place,\nand only then avoiding stray paths and left-handed doctrines,\nfulfilling one’s lifelong aspirations.\n\nWhen this place is clearly understood,\nthe Dao is half attained.\n\nThe following words on *\"heart\"* (心) and *\"speech\"* (言)\nillustrate that in every moment and place,\none must examine and uphold supreme goodness,\nlest one dwell in goodness without first attaining its foundation.\n\nAll that follows,\nno matter how slight, must align with goodness—\nthis is true essential learning and foundational practice.\nIf one neglects this,\nholding oneself and interacting with others,\nall things will crumble to ruin.\n\nI have therefore briefly revealed this,\nhoping those with aspiration in the world\nwill not rely on their talents and intellect,\nrecklessly guessing and presuming,\nwhile failing to cultivate virtue and turn back to the Dao.\n\nOnly with an open heart seeking the Way can one proceed.\n\n---\n**Chapter Nine: *Achievement and Withdrawal* (功成身退)**\n\nTo hold and fill oneself,\nis inferior to having already attained.\nTo clutch and sharpen oneself,\ncannot be preserved long.\n\nGold and jade fill the halls,\nyet none can guard them.\nRich and noble yet proud,\none invites one’s own misfortune.\n\nWhen achievement is complete and name is fulfilled,\nthen one withdraws—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"To cross the river, one must use a raft;\nonce ashore, one need not keep the boat.\"*\nAgain they said:\n*\"Before attaining achievement, one must study the Way;\nwhen achievement is attained, one must forget the Way.\"*\nThese few words are indeed the most vital for cultivating the Dao.\n\nIf one practices the Dao and fulfills deeds,\nhaving already entered the realm of refined and vast achievement,\nyet still clings and guards it,\nboasting of superior learning and profound cultivation,\none cannot avoid the rise of arrogance and agitation,\nleading either to withdrawal and retreat\nor to contradictory and perverse actions.\n\nIf this is so,\nwhere then is the Dao?\nWhat remains of virtue?\n\nThe Supreme Sage says:\n*\"To hold and fill, it is better to cease;\nto clutch and sharpen, one cannot long preserve.\"*\n\nWhen a practitioner’s refinement is yet insufficient,\none must not fail to sift and purify a thousandfold,\nto wash forth my single point of utmost purity,\nas the foundation for eternal life.\n\nIf one obtains true Yang,\nboiling it in the morning and refining it in the evening,\nthe primordial essence fills one’s body inside and out,\nthen one’s body stands firm as a wall a thousand *zhang* high,\none’s mind clear as an autumn moon in a frigid pool.\nThe external *gonads* shrink like those of a child,\nand thus the realm of complete impermeability is attained.\n\nAt this time, when essence is full within the body,\nit is unwise to further apply fire elixirs—\none must stop the fire and instead\nbe blank and unaware, hazy and unknowing,\nsuddenly forgetting the state of essence-fullness\nas the true attainment.\n\nIf one clings to fullness without ceasing,\none risks the peril of spilled elixirs and overturned crucibles—\nit is better to cease early than to suffer harm.\n\nWhen the *qi* is yet insufficient,\none must boil and refine it a thousandfold,\nstirring the martial and civil *divine fires*,\nto forge the primordial *one-yuan true qi* forth,\nas the basis for prolonging life.\nWhen the mundane *qi* is fully refined,\nit transforms into a single piece of pure Yang—\nmost vast, most resolute—\npenetrating the very marrow of one’s sinews and bones,\nvigorous as a dragon, fierce as a tiger.\nWhat greater refinement and sharpness could there be?\n\nI must focus the *qi* to attain softness,\njust as an infant is pure and ignorant.\nOnly then can one long preserve the *qi*,\nreaching the state where both form and spirit are wondrous,\nand one is truly united with the Dao.\nIf one clutches sharpness without rest,\none risks the calamity of flames consuming the fields—\nhow could one expect to preserve it long?\n\nThus, one sees from human affairs that the Way of Heaven is known:\nIn spring, warmth prevails;\nby summer, the scorching sun commands,\nand the gentle warmth is gone.\nIn autumn, coolness descends;\nby winter, the cold dominates,\nand the western winds vanish.\n\nWhen things grow and their purpose is fulfilled,\nwhen the season runs its course and its name is complete,\nHeaven and Earth withdraw and conceal themselves,\nto nurture the virtue of Yang harmony.\nIf winter’s cold were to mix with spring’s warmth,\nand summer’s heat were to blend with autumn’s chill,\nthen the Way of Heaven would be inverted,\nthe seasons would stray from their proper order,\nand the failure to withdraw when achievement is complete\nwould breed perverse *qi*—\nits harm to mortals would be great.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, one withdraws—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\"*\n\nIf Heaven is thus,\nhow much more so for mortals?\nIn history, wise ministers and accomplished men,\nwhose deeds were resplendent and whose fame was renowned,\nyet who did not know to retreat into the mountains,\nlike *Wenzhong* of Yue or *Hanxin* of Han,\nsuffered many calamities—\ntheir lives cut short, their families ruined.\n\nTherefore, those who study the Dao,\nwhen their essence is refined and their *qi* is full,\nmust not fail to forget the Way and forget their form,\nlest they ruin their own Dao.\nIf one has not yet reached this state,\nhow could one abandon the Way and the form?\n\nThis teaching instructs those who cultivate the Great Dao:\nto discard one step, to advance another,\nnever to be self-satisfied or complacent,\nlest arrogance and agitation arise,\nand disaster strike without delay.\nEven without the peril of leakage,\none would still stagnate midway,\nunable to cross to the other shore\nand enter the realm of divine transformation.\n\n*The Awakening to True Reality* says:\n*\"Before refining the elixir, one must refine swiftly;\nwhen refined, one must know to stop and suffice.\nIf one still holds to the fullness of the heart,\none risks ruin and humiliation one day.\"*\n\nIt is clear the Dao has no end,\nachievement knows no limit—\nwhat use is this pretended sufficiency?\n\nIn history, many cultivators\nsuffered calamities—\ntheir lives cut short, their families ruined—\nall because they did not know\nthe Way of *hiding brilliance and nurturing obscurity*,\nof blending with the world and mingling with the dust.\n\nThe *Elixir Canon* says:\n*\"Cultivate while blending with the world,\nand harmonize the light—\nround when round, square when square.\nHidden or revealed, obeying or defying,\nnone shall recognize—\nhow could one teach others to see\nthe realm of concealment and display?\"*\n\nThus, the true Daoists,\nwhen their virtue is profound,\nmust hide themselves and not reveal their brilliance,\nbowing and rising with the times,\nlest they differ and be recognized,\ngood or evil—\nonly then can they long preserve their lives.\n\nOtherwise, when cultivating virtue yet slander arises,\nwhen the Dao is high yet defamation comes,\nthough it may be due to others’ depravity,\nit is also from one’s own excessive display.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Careless hoarding invites theft,\nand primping invites licentiousness\"—\ntruly self-inflicted.\n\nWhy then should those who are self-satisfied\nexpect to avoid harm?\n\nI wish those who come after me:\nbefore making progress, to follow the Way in practice,\nwhen deeply cultivated, to stop and not apply the fire—\nonly then may one avoid the calamity of burning one’s body.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Focusing Qi to Attain Softness**\nTo bear the *yingshen* (vital soul) and embrace unity,\ncan one avoid separation?\nTo focus the *qi* to attain softness,\ncan one be like an infant?\nTo purge and clear the profound vision,\ncan one be without blemish?\nTo love one’s country and govern the people,\ncan one be without action?\nTo open and close the Heavenly Gate,\ncan one be without yielding?\nTo be clear and all-pervasive,\ncan one be without knowing?\n\nTo *nourish* and *cherish*,\nto *nourish* without possession,\nto act without reliance,\nto grow without slaughtering—\nthis is called *mysterious virtue*.\n\nThis chapter begins by speaking of the Dao of refining essence into *qi*.\nOnce the essence and *qi* are within the body,\none must maintain a single heart and single virtue,\nand not allow them to stray even slightly.\nIf they stray, the three treasures—\nessence, *qi*, and spirit—\nwill scatter and not reunite,\nunable to attain the utmost,\nas the foundation for elixir refinement.\n\nThus the Supreme Sage says:\n*\"To bear the yingshen and embrace unity,\ncan one avoid separation?\"*\n\nThe *yingshen* refers to blood.\nBlood is generated by the heart,\nthe *po* (ethereal soul) is stored in the heart—\none must surely illuminate the elixir field,\nkeeping the heart unmoving,\nso that the *shen* (spirit) may flow\nfrom the sun to the moon,\nand the moon may return to pure dryness.\n\nThis arises when the heart’s Yang enters the kidney’s Yin,\nand the divine fire illuminates the blood-water.\nThough water is cold and metal is chilled,\nthe divine fire boils and simmers it,\nand it rises naturally,\nunfettered and boundless.\n\nThe Perfect Sage knows this mysterious female (玄牝) as the root of heaven and earth,\nand thus within each breath—\none inhalation, one exhalation—\nwhen the subtle Yang stirs,\nhe seizes it with a single glance,\ngrasp it with one hand,\nand directs a drop of his own mercury (己汞) to meet it,\nspinning left, drawing right,\nraising it back to the central field (中田),\ncongealing it without dispersion—\nthen he bears the *po* (魄) and returns,\nembracing unity and resting,\nwithout pause,\nand thus the true Yang flourishes,\nthe true *qi* surges.\n\nFrom this, he operates the River Vehicle (河车),\nstokes the fire from the Empty Danger Hole (虚危穴),\ndrawing it to the Tail Lock (尾闾),\nbeating the nine-layered iron drum (九重铁鼓),\nand activating the Three-Legged Golden Toad (三足金蟾),\nascending it to the crown—\nall must be done with singular focus,\nunbroken and unwavering—\nuntil it rises to the Mud Ball (泥丸),\nthe Muni’s Precious Pearl (牟尼宝珠) obtained.\nIf he does not then nourish it for a moment,\nthe Mud Ball’s Yin essence will not transform,\nhow can he achieve the fusion of lead and mercury (铅汞)?\nRefined into sweet dew divine elixir (甘露神水),\nit moistens the hundred vessels (百脉) of the body.\n\nHaving nourished the Mud Ball,\nhe next draws it down to the Lower Red Palace (下重楼),\nentering the Vermilion Court (绛宫),\nthus withdrawing the Yin symbol at noon (午退阴符).\n\nYet when stoking the fire,\none must take its vigor (刚),\nnot relying on the force of dry vigor (乾健之力),\nfor true gold cannot ascend.\nAnd when withdrawing the symbol,\none must take its gentleness (柔),\nnot employing the virtue of yielding compliance (柔顺之德),\nor the Yang lead (阳铅) will remain scattered,\nunable to subdue the mercury and forge the elixir (伏汞成丹).\nThus it is said:\n*\"Can one focus the *qi* to achieve gentleness like a newborn?\"*\n\nIts meaning instructs:\nAfter the Yin is generated at noon (阴生午后),\none must illuminate with a clear mind (一心朗照),\nletting the *qi* mechanism descend naturally,\nas it will—\nunforced and unconstrained,\nyet fully understood—\nthis is the yielding compliance of the *Kūn* hexagram (坤卦柔顺),\nthe path of the virtuous one’s cultivation (君子修行之道).\n\nWhen descending to the Vermilion Court (降宫) for nourishment,\nreturning to the Earth Vessel (土釜),\nsealing it firmly,\none must only reside in tranquility (恬淡),\nharmonizing and settling it,\nin a mere instant—\nthe breath ceases as if nonexistent,\nthe spirit’s movement seems extinguished—\nthis is the attainment of gentleness (致柔).\n\nNourished for a while,\nthe spirit and *qi* return to their roots,\nlike fire seeds in the furnace,\nlong congealed and concentrated,\nnot allowed to scatter wildly,\nnaturally the true *qi* circulates,\nturning through the body—\nthe mind at peace,\nthe limbs supple,\nas if the body of a newborn,\nfluffy and delicate,\nshowing the state of tender weakness beyond endurance (柔弱不堪任物),\nthis is sufficient proof of the elixir’s congealing (丹凝之象).\n\nFrom here, lead and mercury unite,\nwater and fire harmonize—\none must then wash the heart and purge the mind,\ncultivating the single true lead (真铅).\n\nIf the heart wanders even slightly,\nthe elixir will scatter—\nnot only will the elixir have no chance to complete,\nbut even the lead from the Water Village (水乡之铅)\nwill no longer be mine.\n\nThe *Scripture of Purity* (《清净经》) states:\n*\"The heart without its heart, things without their things.\nThe void without its void, the nonexistent without its nonexistent—\nserene and ever still,\nthus the constant quietude.\"*\nWhat flaw could there be?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Can one purify and peer into the mysteries without blemish?\"*\n\nEven if the external elixir is obtained,\ninternal illumination is not strict—\nif human desires are not yet purified,\nheavenly principles not yet refined,\nhow could a single grain of millet elixir (黍球)\nemerge empty yet complete in form (虚而成象)?\n\nWhen the elixir is within the body,\none must still preserve essence and enrich *qi*,\nto form the sacred embryo (圣胎).\n\nYet this preservation must follow nature’s course,\nthis enrichment must accord with spontaneity (自在).\nThe unforced preservation surpasses forced preservation,\nthe unconstrained enrichment surpasses constrained enrichment.\nOtherwise, clinging to preciousness,\nfew escape harm.\n\nThe elixir is primordial *qi* (先天元气),\nformless and undefined—\nwhy must it be made manifest?\nIf one seeks its traces,\none risks stirring the post-heaven fire (火动后天),\nand the great Dao of the primordial will be lost.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Can one love the people and govern the state without action?\"*\nThe people are like essence (民比精也),\nthe state like *qi* (国喻气也).\nThe key to governing lies in benevolence to love the people.\n\nEstablishing laws to govern,\nthis is but the minor gratification of a hegemon (霸者),\nfar from the king’s virtue of non-action (王者的无为而治).\nRepeatedly bright and refined (重熙累治),\nthe contest lies in action and non-action.\n\nThe path to cultivating the body:\nessence steadied is like the people at ease,\n*qi* abundant is like the state prosperous.\nRefining oneself makes essence steadied,\nnourishing directly makes *qi* abundant—\nextreme purity (浩然) and great vigor (刚大),\nfilling both realms (两间),\nas if seeing it as one’s fixed possession,\na common practice,\nnot boasting of ability,\nnot flaunting wisdom—\nmuddled and indistinct,\nas if forgetting the very act of cultivation,\nnon-action yet great action emerges.\n\nWhen the student reaches this stage,\nessence full and *qi* abundant,\nnourishing it long and steadily,\nnaturally the crown splits and the elixir ascends,\nable to ride the clouds in high flight,\nsoar over the ocean isles—\ncompared to those who formerly adhered to the strict rules,\nfocusing *qi* to achieve gentleness,\nthe difference is vast!\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Can one open and close the Heavenly Gate without duality?\"*\nThis speaks of the former days,\nwhen adjusting the spirit and nourishing the embryo (调神养胎)\ncould not avoid clinging to duality (守雌).\nNow the Yang spirit is robust and flourishing,\nfree from the mundane body,\nbursting through the Heavenly Gate,\nascending to the celestial expanse—\ntruly joyous!\n\nHow is the *qi* robust?\nAt this point, the heart is like a clear mirror,\nthe nature like still water,\nilluminating the heavens,\nlively on the earth—\nall knowledge and perception (知觉之识神)\ntransform into the void and boundless (空洞之元神).\n\nForeknowledge and foresight (前知后晓),\nburning yet dissolving (烛照糜遗),\nthis is clarity—\nthus all paths are open without contradiction.\n\nYet ever serene and ever illuminated,\nno trace of illumination or stillness remains;\never clear and ever aware,\nno thought of clarity or perception lingers.\nIt is as if all things come and are reflected,\nlike a high-hanging mirror,\nwhere nothing can hide—\nyet all must be rooted in non-action (无为),\naction as its use (有为).\n\nWhen the Yang has not yet arisen,\none accumulates essence and enriches *qi* to generate it;\nonce the Yang has arisen,\none treasures essence and enriches *qi* to store it.\nWhen later the form is retained to transform the world,\naccumulating merit and virtue—\nthough born, one does not boast of nurturing (不夸辅育之功),\nthough acting, one does not rely on effort (不恃矜持之力),\nthough long-lived, one does not depend on constraint (不假制伏之劳).\n\nThus, the heart of one eon is the heart of ten thousand eons—\ntruly, it may be called the celestial sovereign,\nempowered to oversee the creation of the cosmos.\nHence, it is called the **\"Mysterious Virtue/Power\" (玄德)**.\n\nWhen this master speaks of the nine stages of refining the foundation to obtain the elixir,\nof purifying oneself to return the cinnabar,\nand of shedding the mortal form to gain the pearl—\nthe essence lies in nothingness reaching its utmost and stillness attaining its depth,\nin embracing the Three and holding the One,\nin the hazy and indistinct, the boundless and formless.\nFrom the foundation to returning the cinnabar,\nall depends on the interplay of indistinct yet knowing,\nand of transforming the manifest from the unmanifest.\n\nThe Dao/Way originates at the beginning of **Hongmeng (鸿蒙)**,\nmixed within the void of emptiness.\nIt is unseen, unheard—\nhow then can one who practices it take hold?\nThe Sage knows the Dao/Way’s essence is formless,\nyet its function manifests in phenomena.\nThus, with the formless as substance,\nand the substantial as formless,\nthey steal the **qi** from the realm of **Hun-Dun (浑浑沌沌)**,\nand gather the spirit within the hazy and indistinct.\nTo perfect the Great Oneness of the Dao/Way,\nand to become an immortal sage forever—\n\nWhat is meant by **\"substantial yet manifest\"**?\nThe true yin and true yang,\nand all sentient beings of the same kind.\n\nWhat is meant by **\"formless yet void\"**?\nThe root of the primordial Dao/Way,\nand the **Dragon-Tiger (龙虎)** **Eight Trigrams (二八)** initial threads of **qi**.\n\nWhere **qi** exists without matter,\nthe Dao/Way shines forth.\nThus it is said:\n*\"When yin and yang unite, the primordial qi appears;\nwhen yin and yang divide, the later-heaven vessels form.\"*\n\nThe *Yijing (易)* says:\n*\"Above the form, it is called Dao/Way;\nbelow the form, it is called qi.\"*\nWithout vessels, there is no way to perceive the Dao/Way;\nwithout the Dao/Way, there is no means to bear the vessels.\n\nThe **Most High (太上)** borrows the analogy of a **chariot (车)**:\nA chariot has spokes and a hub;\nthirty spokes symbolize the movement of the sun and moon,\nwhile the hub sits at the center,\npierced by all the axles.\nThe hub is hollow within,\nthe spokes gather without—\nthus it turns effortlessly.\nIf not for this inner void,\nhow could one be carried?\nHow could things be stored?\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"When it is void, then the chariot’s use is realized.\"*\n\nAgain, like pottery:\nMixing water with clay,\nkneading the clay into vessels,\nonce fired and refined,\nthey are solid without yet hollow within—\nyet for all practical purposes,\nhuman utility lies not in the clay’s substance,\nbut in the empty void.\nAs with **Tao Can (陶侃)** moving bricks,\nif not for the space within that is void and empty,\nhow could they be turned with ease?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When it is void, then the vessel’s use is realized.\"*\n\nFurther, consider building a dwelling:\nOne must carve doors and windows within it,\nand only then does light pour forth.\nOnce inside this dwelling,\nthe doors and windows seem unnecessary—\none focuses on the empty space,\nwhere one may rest one’s knees.\nThough the dwelling is formed as substance,\ntrue residence lies in its practical emptiness.\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"When it is void, then the dwelling’s use is realized.\"*\n\nFrom these three analogies observed,\nthe void is not without form as chariot, vessel, and dwelling;\nthe void is not without form as carrier, storehouse, and abode.\nYet those who dwell in the formless\nare the ones who enrich the practical use of the manifest.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The manifest is for utility, the void is for function;\nboth manifest and void\nare mutually their roots.\"*\n\nIn essence, the Dao/Way is originally void and formless—\nyet without yin and yang, it cannot be seen.\n**Qi** belongs to yin and yang—\nyet without the Dao/Way, it cannot arise.\nYin and yang are born after heaven and earth,\nhaving definite shapes and locations,\nand cannot be the elixir of eternal life.\nOnly by seeking the Dao/Way within yin and yang,\nand returning through yin and yang to the **Great Ultimate (太极)**,\ncan the primordial and later-heaven be united,\nand the Dao/Way be attained.\n\nLater alchemists who refine the elixir\nmerely ingest the manifest **qi**,\nunaware of forging the formless elixir.\nIf they wish to become immortals,\nare they not traveling south while aiming north?\n\nThe Dao/Way has no name,\nyet it is named **\"Dao/Way\"**.\nThe Dao/Way has no practice,\nyet it is called **\"practice\"**.\n\nFor the Dao/Way as a thing,\nwhen it reaches utmost void and utmost formlessness,\nonly then can it reach utmost divinity and sainthood.\nObserve how the **qi** of heaven and earth is clear and empty,\nwith nothing at all—\nyet when it is suppressed for long,\nand the **qi** mechanism stirs,\nthen yin and yang arise.\n\nThus, myriad forms and colors appear,\nwith patterns distinct and chapters brilliant,\nfilling the four extremes.\nWho creates them?\nWho gives them birth?\n\nAll things arise from the Dao/Way generating **one qi**,\nand from **one qi** transforming into yin and yang,\nthus giving birth to the myriad things.\nHence it is said:\n*\"The Dao/Way from emptiness and nothingness generates **one qi**,\nthen from **one qi** produces yin and yang.\nYin and yang thus form the three transformations,\nand the three transformations regenerate the flourishing of myriad changes.\"*\n\nThose who practice the Dao/Way to attain its true essence\nand achieve the body of immortality and sainthood\nmust first use yin and yang as their tools,\nthen take emptiness and nothingness as their foundation,\nand thus the Great Dao/Way is attained.\n\nThe three **\"without\"** characters within the chapter\nrefer to the void as **\"without\"**—\nroughly speaking, the practitioner moves from **\"without\"** to **\"with\"**\nand from **\"with\"** back to **\"without\"**\nuntil reaching a clear and empty **one qi**,\nand only then does the Great Dao/Way take form.\nIts meaning is doubtless derived from this.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twelve: Discarding the Extraneous, Taking the Essential**\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes;\nthe five tones deafen the ears;\nthe five flavors dull the palate;\nhunting and galloping in the wild drive the mind to madness;\nrare treasures bring misfortune upon one’s conduct.\n\nThus the sage prioritizes the belly over the eyes,\nand so discards the extraneous while taking the essential.\n\nThe world’s restless pursuit—\nracing the heart through the fields of sound, color, wealth, and gain—\ncasting the gaze far and wide,\ndelighting the heart and pleasing the mouth—\nis this not because the joys within are truly satisfying?\n\nYet who knows that worldly pleasures are limited,\nwhile the joys of the heart are boundless?\n\nMoreover, where pleasure resides, sorrow also dwells.\nWhat benefits the body harms the heart.\n\nTake the brilliance of five-colored patterns—\ntheir hues radiant, their designs dazzling—\nwho does not gaze upon them with delight,\nor behold them with awe?\nYet the more one fixes the eyes upon them,\nthe more the spirit grows dizzy.\n\nHow much vital essence does a life contain?\nTo linger over sights and indulge the senses,\ndeeming them beautiful—\nwho does not end up with obstructed **qi**, a fading spirit,\na disordered mind,\nand eyes that, ironically, grow blind?\nThus it is said: *\"The five colors blind the eyes\"*—\na truth most profound.\n\nAs for the melodies of silk and bamboo,\nthe sounds of pipes and flutes—\neven the ancients did not abandon them.\nYet the foolish and debauched,\nlost in female consorts and singing boys,\nexhaust their vital essence for fleeting pleasure!\nBefore the music even ends,\nits lingering echoes still resound—\nyet the soul’s inner reserves are drained outward,\nand the ears grow deaf.\nThus it is said: *\"The five tones deafen the ears.\"*\n\nAs for the palate’s tastes—\nharmonious sweetness and richness,\nbalanced in thickness and thinness—\neven the sage requires them.\nBut gluttonous folk,\ngreedy for the mouth’s delights,\npile exotic dishes upon the table,\nfill the kitchen with strange fare—\nthough they spend a fortune on a single meal,\nthey never hesitate.\nDo they not know that what pleases the mouth harms the heart?\nMoreover, the heart holds boundless true flavors—\nwithout fatty richness, yet naturally sweet;\nwithout rich meats, yet naturally sated.\nThose who merely seek to satisfy the mouth\nare but chasing empty gratification.\nThus it is said: *\"The five flavors dull the palate.\"*\n\nAs for hunting—\nin ancient times, emperors used it to eliminate pests and protect the people,\nto ensure agricultural peace.\nLater generations, however, pursued beasts and birds,\nchasing them through fields and forests,\nsetting dogs loose to ravage the wilds,\neven slaughtering harmless serpents, insects, and creatures without cause.\nSome took pleasure in cruelty, harming life for sport,\nshowing no remorse.\nIn the end, the heavens repay such deeds—\nthe netherworld’s punishments are inevitable.\nIn an instant, misfortune follows.\nMoreover, when one gallops through the wilds,\none unleashes the violent nature within—\nthe body grows wild, the mind grows wild.\nThus the *Tao Te Ching* warns: *\"Hunting and galloping drive the mind to madness.\"*\n\nFurthermore, rare and strange treasures—\nemperors did not hoard them in their eyes,\nfor this cultivated refined tastes and peaceful customs.\nLater generations, however, prized the strange and unusual,\nspending half their lives scheming and toiling,\nexhausting their vital essence on goods.\nYet what one covets, others covet too—\nand in seeking to possess it alone,\nthe tide of plunder grows ever stronger.\nThe ancients said: *\"An ordinary man bears no guilt,\nyet suspicion clings to him like a shadow.\"*\nThus it is known that the richer the hoard,\nthe deeper the coming ruin—\na truth not false.\n\nEven if one guards against it with all one’s strength,\nprotects it with every means—\nif the heavens and spirits do not favor it,\nit will still perish in the end.\nLife and fate are precious—\nonce the soul departs, where are the treasures then?\nWhy not value the inner and disregard the outer?\n\nThus the *Tao Te Ching* solemnly warns:\n*\"Rare treasures bring misfortune upon one’s conduct.\"*\nTherefore, those who grasp the high Dao\nempty their minds to nurture their nature,\nfill their bellies to sustain their lives;\nknowing that the primordial **one qi** comes with birth\nand departs with death—\nit is the unbreakable treasure of the body—\nif one focuses wholly upon it,\nall external things become like passing clouds—\nthus their spirit remains pure and unobstructed,\nas if receiving offerings from mortals,\nor ruling as celestial sovereigns,\nyet they still appear humble and unassuming.\n\nNow ask—\nare the zithers of Shun, the ivory pipes of Zhao,\nthe lyres of Qi, or the lodges of Lu\nstill preserved today?\nLong since lost to oblivion!\n\nThus it is known:\nthings are finite, but the Dao/Way is infinite;\nmortals are limited, but the Dao/Way is boundless.\nTo seek longevity, one must set aside the finite things of the world\nand cultivate the formless essence of life—\nonly then will one know what to value and what to discard.\n\nAlas—\nunless one is a sage of profound insight,\nhow can one discard the extraneous and take the essential?\n\nThe fundamental teaching for cultivating the self\nis fundamentally opposed to the ways of the world.\nOne must know:\nwhat the world desires, the Dao/Way rejects;\nwhat the world pursues, the Dao/Way avoids.\n\nWhat the world covets, the Dao/Way abandons.\nFor though fame, desire, wealth, and gain\nmay bring profit to the body,\nthey bring no benefit to the heart.\nIndeed, once the heart grows greedy,\nthe body itself falls into discord.\n\nAs for the cultivation of one’s true nature and vital essence—\nthough it seems formless and intangible,\nit is not something the body can deem unworthy.\nIf one can discard external temptations,\nnurture what is inherently true,\nand devote oneself wholeheartedly to cultivation,\nseeking nothing from without,\nthen ultimately, virtue and achievement will be complete,\nand the Dao/Way of longevity will be attained.\n\nWhat treasure in all the world\ncan compare to this?\n\nYet fear arises:\nif resolve is not steadfast,\nif progress in the Dao/Way lacks courage,\nif reason and desire clash,\nif heaven and humanity conflict,\nthen reaching the utmost will be difficult indeed.\n\nMay those who follow later\nfirst cultivate stillness and sincerity,\nthen refine the lead and subdue the mercury,\nand when returning to the origin,\nembracing simplicity and returning to truth—\nwhat difficulty is there in ascending to consort with the immortals?\n\nThus the sage cultivates the inner, not the outer;\nnourishes the vital core, not the senses;\ndiscards the false to preserve the true,\nand with singular focus, concentrates the spirit,\nfulfilling one’s nature and establishing one’s destiny—\nhow could this not far surpass the world’s fleeting glories by ten thousandfold?\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation as Sudden Alarms**\n\nHonor and humiliation—both must be met with sudden alarm.\nTo hold great calamity as one’s own self—what does this mean?\n\nWhat is meant by *\"honor and humiliation as sudden alarm\"*?\nHonor is of lesser worth; to gain it is cause for alarm,\nto lose it is cause for alarm—\nthis is called *\"honor and humiliation as sudden alarm.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by *\"to hold great calamity as one’s own self\"*?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nis that I have this body.\nBut if I have no body,\nwhat calamity could I have?\n\nThus, to value the body as the foundation for all under heaven\nis to make it worthy of trust.\nTo cherish the body as the foundation for all under heaven\nis to make it worthy of reliance.\n\nMencius said: *\"What is most important to guard? Guarding the body is most important.\"*\nThe *Book of Poetry* says: *\"Both wise and enlightened, preserving one’s self.\"*\n\nHow greatly did the ancients value the body!\n\nFor with this body,\nnot only does one’s own nature and vital essence depend on it for existence,\nbut within one’s family,\nnone can live without relying on it.\n\nExtending this further—\nto establish the heart for heaven and earth,\nto establish destiny for all things,\nto continue the learning of past sages,\nto bring eternal peace to future generations—\nall this is governed by this body alone.\n\nYet though this body governs the cosmos,\nit is the Dao/Way alone that governs this body.\nThe Dao/Way cannot exist independently in empty space;\nit must rely on humanity to uphold it.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The body exists, so the Dao/Way exists;\nthe body perishes, so the Dao/Way perishes.\"*\n\nGreat practitioners, before the Dao/Way is complete,\nmust distance themselves from the world,\nretreat into mountains and forests,\nconceal their brilliance and nurture obscurity,\ndelight in the Dao/Way and endure poverty,\nhearing no human voices,\nspeaking not of worldly affairs,\ntheir feet never treading the dust of the world—\nhow could this be merely to avoid calamity and preserve the body?\nIt is also to establish the body and fulfill one’s destiny.\n\nAs for worldly honors and humiliations,\nthey are regarded as ordinary occurrences,\nnot worth the slightest concern.\nThough suddenly summoned by imperial decree,\nor honored with gifts and invitations,\nthough princes and ministers bestow extraordinary favors,\nor though humble dwellings are adorned with imperial splendor—\nthings that make others rejoice to madness—\nthe sage remains only more detached.\n\nShould misfortune strike, with reputation exceeding measure,\nand slanderous tongues bring sudden disgrace,\nshould one’s family suffer unjust accusations,\nthe sage alone does not shift blame to others\nbut accepts responsibility themselves.\n\nThe ancient sages, when honored, did not lose their true nature;\nwhen humiliated, did not lose their body—\nand for good reason.\nAll understood the Dao/Way of preserving the body:\nthey did not nourish it with fame and wealth,\nbut cultivated it with virtue, righteousness, and morality—\nthus achieving an unbreakable body,\nrelied upon by all ages.\n\nYet if one clings to the body in selfishness,\nprizes it above all,\ncompetes for name and gain,\nschemes for food and clothing,\nstruggles ceaselessly in restless pursuit,\ncontending without end,\nseizing without restraint—\nthen calamity will follow swiftly on its heels.\n\nThus the noble one values concealing their worth to await the right moment,\nand establishing the body to uphold virtue.\n\nThe supreme sage observes that people cannot\nreside in honor while fearing disaster,\nnor avert calamity before it manifests—\nhence the exhortation:\n*\"Honor and humiliation as sudden alarm,\nto hold great calamity as one’s own self.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by *\"honor and humiliation as sudden alarm\"*?\nIt is because honor is a later-acquired glory,\nnot an inherent nobility—\nthus it is said *\"honor is of lesser worth.\"*\nYet common human nature clings to gain and loss,\nso gaining it is cause for alarm,\nlosing it is cause for alarm—\nthis is *\"honor and humiliation as sudden alarm.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by *\"to hold great calamity as one’s own self\"*?\nIt is because one’s very existence as a body\nis the source of calamity.\nIf there were no body,\nfrom where would calamity arise?\n\nWhile the Dao/Way is not yet complete,\none must retain the body as the vessel for cultivation.\nBut once the shell is cast off and ascent is achieved—\nwhen one has spirit without form,\nwhat calamity could befall?\n\nEven while dwelling in the world,\nall entanglements are severed,\nthe One True Essence contained within—\nthough traversing the four directions,\none moves freely as they will,\nand what great calamity could there be?\n\nThose who cultivate today,\ndesiring to become gods of ten thousand years,\nthe hope of ten thousand people,\nachieving extraordinary deeds,\nestablishing eternal merit—\nmust ensure that every word and action\nis without the slightest excess.\nOnly by valuing the body and preserving it\ncan one become worthy of bearing the destiny of all under heaven.\n\nOnly by restraint in every movement and stillness\ncan one become worthy of being relied upon by all under heaven.\n\nLike Shun, who plowed in the fields for years\nbefore being summoned three times with sincere respect,\nand who took upon himself the responsibility of ruling the people as Yao and Shun had—\nor like Zhuge Liang, who reclined in Nanyang,\nyet when offered silk and jade,\nassumed the role of a pillar supporting the Three Kingdoms—\n\nTo entrust the fate of a six-foot infant\nand the destiny of a hundred-li realm—\nwho else but such a one could bear this responsibility?\n\nTo seek the Dao of selflessness and rise high above the world,\nyet fail to use the Way to benefit all under heaven,\nand let all under heaven wander freely within the Great Dao—\nthis is a path far removed indeed.\n\nThis speaks of the body’s inherent nobility,\nrequiring no external search,\nand of a virtue beyond comparison to worldly honors of rank and wealth.\n\nIf one strives with unremitting effort from this point—\nas the ancients said, *\"Toil for two or three years,\nand joy shall endure for ten thousand ages\"*—\ntruly, this is no falsehood.\nWhat then are the shocks of favor or disgrace,\nor the sighs of noble suffering?\n\nWhen scholars have not yet attained the Great Dao,\nthey must rely upon this body as their vessel for cultivation.\nIf one merely regards food and clothing,\nwealth and glory, as the essentials for nourishing the body,\nthen the mortal frame grows heavy,\nand the Primal Dao-body is sure to suffer thereby.\n\nOnce the Primal Dao-body is impaired,\nthe mortal frame itself will scarcely endure long.\nThus does the common man love his body\nand yet ultimately lose it.\n\nOnly the Sage knows that all things are but phantoms,\nborn of impermanence and destruction,\nand cannot be taken as true.\nOnly my Primal Dao-qi is the source of my birth,\nenduring for one age, or a hundred,\nor ten thousand years.\n\nWithout true cultivation of this,\nhow could the mortal frame ever exist?\nThis is the inner body within man—\npreserve it, and life continues;\nlose it, and death ensues.\n\nDissipate it, and it becomes matter;\ncongeal it, and it becomes the Dao-immortal.\nNever for an instant can it be abandoned.\n\nThe Supreme Sage teaches one to be diligent and cautious,\nnever daring to neglect even the smallest matter,\nnever allowing a single thought to waver,\nand especially not to contend with others for strength or victory.\nOnly by serene self-contentment,\nby purity without dust,\ncan one truly adapt to one’s own nature.\n\nThough he has not yet emerged to aid the people,\nthe common folk already rejoice in his safety within the four inches.\nHow else could the myriad generations be saved?\nThe people’s reverence for him is profound and sincere.\n\nTo find no joy in one’s own pleasure,\nbut joy in the pleasure of all under heaven,\nto feel no sorrow in one’s own woes,\nbut sorrow in the woes of all under heaven—\nwhat greater trust could there be?\n\n**Chapter XIV: The Symbol Without Symbol**\nWhat cannot be seen is called *Yī* (the tranquil);\nWhat cannot be heard is called *Xī* (the subtle);\nWhat cannot be grasped is called *Wēi* (the minute).\nThese three cannot be questioned,\nso they merge into one.\n\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nits lower depths are not dark—\nendless and nameless,\nreturning to the formless.\nThis is called the state without form,\nthe symbol without symbol—\nthe Dao of *huǎnghǔ* (vague and indistinct).\n\nPursue it, and you cannot see its head;\nfollow it, and you cannot find its tail.\nTo wield the ancient Dao\nand govern the present with it,\nto know the origins of the ancient—\nthis is called the Dao’s thread.\n\nAll things under heaven must have their order,\nonly then can one grasp the main points,\nhold the leading lines,\nand proceed without confusion.\nHow much more so for cultivating the Dao?\n\nThe source of the Great Dao is the Primal Dao-qi;\nThe root of the Great Dao is the Primal Dao-qi.\nWhat is the Primal Dao-qi?\n*The Odes* say: *\"The mandate of Heaven, serene and unceasing.\"*\n\nWhat is the root of the Great Dao?\n*The Odes* say: *\"The carriage of Heaven, without sound or scent.\"*\nWhen essence and qi unite in harmony, this is the Dao.\n\nIf cultivators recognize this guiding principle,\nand discern its subtle beginnings,\nthen by regulating emotions with wisdom,\nand fixing nature with righteousness,\nand by taking the Dao-qi of emptiness and nothingness as their foundation—\nthe path to longevity is attained.\n\nIf one takes clarity and brightness,\nlucidity and distinctness,\nas the method of cultivation,\nI fear the Dao has no true substance,\nand all efforts are in vain.\n\nThus the Supreme Sage describes the Primal Dao:\n*\"What cannot be seen is called Yī;\nWhat cannot be heard is called Xī;\nWhat cannot be grasped is called Wēi.\"*\n\nThe heart communicates with the eyes—\nthe eyes harbor the spirit.\nThe kidneys communicate with the ears—\nthe ears harbor the essence.\nThe spleen communicates with the limbs—\nthe limbs belong to the spleen,\nthe spleen belongs to earth,\nearth nurtures all things,\nand the true qi congeals within.\nThus the spirit and essence reside there.\n\nIf the eyes perceive something,\nif the ears hear something,\nif the hands act—\nthese are all the shaped, colored, sounded, and scented essence-qi of the post-heaven.\nThey can only form matter,\nnot the Dao itself.\n\nOnly when the eyes see nothing—\nthen the post-heaven wood-nature is revealed;\nOnly when the ears hear nothing—\nthen the post-heaven metal-essence is revealed;\nOnly when the hands grasp nothing—\nthen the post-heaven intent-earth is revealed.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe post-heaven water, fire, and earth\ngive rise to form;\nThe pre-heaven metal, wood, and earth\nlead to immortality.\n\nWhat is called *Yī*, *Xī*, and *Wēi*\nare all profound and mysterious,\nbeyond all reach—\ntruly, there is what cannot be exhausted.\n\nIf one can merge the five essences into one essence,\nand blend the three primal elements into one,\nthen the true essence-qi is here,\nand the natural sovereign is here as well.\n\nThus *Awakening to the True* says:\n*\"The maiden wears green robes (fire engenders water),\nthe young man wraps himself in white silk (water engenders metal).\nSee it, yet cannot use it (post-heaven water, fire, earth),\nuse it, yet cannot see it (pre-heaven metal, wood, earth).\nIn vague indistinctness we meet (blended into one),\nin boundless darkness there is change.\nIn a flash, flames rise—\nthe True Person emerges.\"*\n\nWhen cultivators know this,\nthey know the source of the Great Dao,\nand the key to cultivating it.\n\nIf they do not know its origin in emptiness and nothingness,\nbut cling to the filth of their mortal frame,\nto confused and impure spirit,\nto a generated and enlightened mind,\nand to deliberate visualizations—\nI fear their stored essence is not deep,\nand their manifestation will not be smooth.\n\nThis is the work of refining essence, qi, and spirit,\nso that it never departs from the state of *hún-dùn* (chaotic unity).\nOnce in chaotic unity,\nwith time the embryo grows long,\nand the yang-spirit is born—\nbut the methods of nurturing the embryo and fostering the spirit\nmust also be understood,\nas taught in the previous chapter:\n*\"Love the people, govern the realm,\nand practice the Dao of non-action.\"*\n\nThe cultivator knows this—\nwhen the yang-spirit moves in and out,\nits flow is natural and unfettered.\nAt times, the spirit ascends to the upper realm,\nyet one cannot trace its origin from above—\nthus it is not dazzling.\nAt times, the spirit withdraws to the lower depths,\nyet one does not neglect its hidden abode—\nthus it is not obscured.\n\nFrom this, it extends endlessly and subtly,\ncontinuously and firmly,\nineffable and beyond deliberate action—\nreturning to the primordial state before one’s parents gave birth,\nwhere all is indistinct and nothing exists in particular.\n\nThe *Yì* says: *\"Wash the heart and retreat, hiding in the profound.\"*\nThis is its very essence!\nHence it is said: *\"Reverting to the state of nothingness.\"*\n\nThough nothingness it may be,\nyet all things under heaven—\nten thousand affairs, ten thousand beings—\narise from this void.\nThus the *Tàishàng* speaks of the *Dao*’s formless form,\nits shapeless shape—\nfor indeed, what form or shape does it possess?\nOnly a fleeting glimpse within the *huǎnghuǎng hūhū* (dimly indistinct).\n\nIf truly dimly indistinct,\nthen the *zhēnyuán* (true essence) will emerge.\nGreet its opportunity and guide it—\none sees not from where it arises,\nfor its beginning is unseen—\nfollow its *qi* and draw it forth—\none sees not where it ends,\nfor its conclusion is unmarked.\nSuch is the vastness of the *Dao*.\n\nIs this not the great *Zhōushā* (boundless space) of the *Jìnguān* (pure land),\nrefined into the finest *háománg* (hair’s tip)?\nThis *Dao*—what *Dao* is it?\nIt is the *yuánshǐ* (primordial) *qì* of *yīnqì* (one breath),\nthe true sovereign of the human body’s organs and bones.\n\nTo obtain it is to live;\nto lose it is to die.\nTo preserve it fully is to be human;\nto neglect it is to become mere matter—\nits manifestation lies only in a hair’s breadth.\n\nWhen a student of the *Dao* attains this primordial *qì*,\nharmonizing and regulating the five organs and hundred bones,\nthen their hair and nails shine with vitality,\ntheir skin and flesh grow smooth and supple—\nthis is called *\"grasp the ancient Dao,\nto govern the present with its power.\"*\n\nIf a person can recognize this primordial *qì*—\nthe very breath that gave rise to heaven and earth,\nthe unfathomable essence of antiquity—\nand take it as the guiding principle of their body,\nthe mastermind of all affairs,\nthen their foundation stands firm while their actions unfold naturally,\ntheir root is upright and their branches align in order.\n\nIf a student of the *Dao* does not regard this primordial *qì* as their foundation,\nbut seeks to cultivate *zhèngjué* (enlightened awareness),\nfalling instead into tangential paths,\nthen woe unto them!\n\nThis describes the substance of the *Dao*.\nOnly those who study the *Dao* and grasp its substance\ncan have a place to begin their practice.\n\nIf the *qì* of true unity is the source of innate life and vitality,\nit cannot be compared to the later-born *jīng-qì-shén* (essence, *qi*, and spirit).\nTo perceive the life-*qì*,\none must merge the innate truth with the true essence into one,\nonly then attaining the *qì* of true unity.\n\nThough this *qì* is boundless and profound,\nits form and shape are indistinct,\nyet all things under heaven—\nthose with form and shape—\nemerge from this very formlessness and shapelessness.\nTruly, it is the framework of the great *Dao*,\nthe foundation of heaven, earth, and all beings.\n\nThe *Dao* speaks of *\"guarding the center\"* (守中),\nBuddhism of *\"contemplating emptiness\"* (观空),\nConfucianism of *\"cultivating solitude with caution\"* (慎独)—\nall share the same fundamental function.\n\nThus, from the perspective of others,\nit seems as though there is nothing to see or hear,\nyet within oneself, it is utterly clear—\nboth supremely empty and supremely real,\nboth utterly nonexistent and utterly present.\n\nHence *Zǐsī* said:\n*\"Do not reveal the hidden,\ndo not display the subtle.\"*\n\nThe scholar’s diligence in cultivating solitude\nis indeed unremitting.\n\nIn essence, the hidden and subtle realms of solitude,\nthough there may be what can be revealed or substantiated,\nthe roots of the great *Dao*\nare only profound and mysterious—\nineffable yet described,\nshapeless yet symbolized,\nultimately indistinct and tranquil.\n\nStudents of the *Dao* must,\nbefore the yang arises, await it in *huǎnghuǎng hūhū* (dimly indistinct),\nwhen the yang is already born, greet it in *huǎnghuǎng hūhū*,\nwhen the yang returns to the furnace and enters the cauldron,\nguard and nurture it in *huǎnghuǎng hūhū*—\nnever stirring the mind to deliberate enlightenment,\nso that they may never fail to attain the *Dao*’s return at any time or place.\n\nEarlier, it was said:\nWhen the yang-spirit appears,\nit illuminates heaven and penetrates earth,\nreaching the profound and subtle,\nand upon sudden enlightenment,\nthe radiant landscape is pure and natural—\nknowing yet as though unaware,\nawake yet as though unenlightened—\nhow much more so at the very start of practice,\nwhen one must not be *huǎnghuǎng hūhū* (dimly indistinct),\nbut instead quiet the mortal mind to birth the *Dao*-heart.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Subtle and Profound Penetration**\nThe ancients who excelled in cultivation\nwere subtle and profound,\ndeep beyond comprehension.\n\nOnly because they were beyond comprehension\ndid they forcefully describe their appearance:\n*\"Cautious, as though crossing a river in winter,*\n*solemn, as though fearing neighbors on all sides,*\n*dignified, as though a guest,*\n*dissipated, as though ice about to melt,*\n*unadorned, as though uncarved wood,*\n*vast, as though an empty valley,*\n*muddy, as though turbid waters.*\n\nWho can clarify the turbid,\nletting it settle slowly into clarity?\nWho can remain still,\nyet stir for ages into life?\n\nThose who preserve this *Dao* do not wish to be full,\nthus their vessel never wears out.\nThe *Tàishàng* spoke of the *Dao*’s substance in the previous chapter;\nnow he speaks of those who embody the *Dao*.\n\nMan and the *Dao* are two yet one.\nThe *Dao* is invisible,\nyet through man, it becomes visible.\nHow can man become transcendent?\nThrough the *Dao*, he attains transcendence.\n\nWhat is the *Dao*?\nIt is the *qì* of true unity.\nThe *qì* of true unity is the *dé* (virtue/power) of the *Zhōngyōng* (Doctrine of the Mean).\n\nTo cultivate the great *Dao*, what else is there?\n*Wénwáng* (King Wen) served the *Shàngdì* (August Heaven) with utmost reverence,\nand *Kǒngzǐ* (Confucius) stood with feet drawn in,\nas though bound by a thread.\n\nThe *Dao* as *Dao*\nis nothing more than this single act of reverence.\nIf a person can hold reverence in their heart,\nnever carelessly neglecting a single thought or deed,\nis not the great *Dao* already within them?\n\nThough it is so,\nthe *Dao* has no strange wonders—\nit relies entirely on those who embody it.\nThus the *Dao* is not suspended empty in heaven and earth.\n\nHence the *Tàishàng* says:\nThe ancients who excelled in cultivation\nwere not dualistic in their actions,\nthus their birth of beings was unfathomable.\nHow profound and mysterious is their attainment!\n\n*\"Motionless yet responsive,\ncommunicating without effort.\"*\nHow supremely profound and penetrating is this!\n\nObserve their hearts—vast and boundless—\ntheir *qì*—abundant and flowing—\nnot unlike the depths of rivers and streams,\nmaking them impossible to measure or recognize.\n\nThus the *Tàishàng* says:\n*\"Only because it is beyond recognition,\ndo they forcefully describe its appearance.\"*\n\n「To reveal the true unknowability within,\nyet forcefully describe its outward form—\ntheir hearts ever cautious in solitude,\ntheir sincerity ever present in all things,\nlike the cautious traveler crossing a river,\nwaiting for ice to freeze before daring to proceed;\nor the vigilant night walker,\nwaiting for the wind to still before moving forward—\nthis is the utmost care.\n\nTheir solemn composure,\nlike a distinguished guest arriving from afar,\nnever daring to slacken in demeanor;\ntheir effortless release—\nunburdened by ties,\nsmooth as flowing water,\nvanished without trace—\ntheir loyal and virtuous hearts,\ntheir benevolent treatment of all,\npure as the uncarved *Tàipǔ* (太朴),\nunpolished yet seamless in harmony.\n\nTheir dignified bearing,\ntheir humble self-restraint—\nwhat differs from the profound depths of mountain valleys,\nempty yet boundless,\nvast yet containing all?\n\nTheir form is thus,\nand their nature may be known.\nAll is contained within the silent *huntian* (浑天),\nfollowing the *imperial* (帝) pattern yet unrecognized.\n\nLike *Shùn* (舜) dwelling in the mountains,\nno distinction from the wild mountain folk.\n\nCan their *hun* (浑) and *è* (噩) ways be imitated by the dull and turbid?\nThough *hun* (浑) and *è* (浊) may seem alike,\nsaints and commoners share one principle—\nthe turbidity of common folk is truly turbid;\nthe turbidity of the sage,\nthough appearing like turbidity,\nis in truth the utmost turbidity and the utmost clarity.\n\nYet the sage does not claim sainthood,\nfor that is how they become the sage;\nthe commoner does not claim ordinariness,\nfor that is how they remain the commoner.\n\nWho can clarify the heart’s stains,\nmaking it serene,\nwaiting for its stillness to endure,\nuntil pure light reveals itself?\n\nWho can nurture the nature’s innate tranquility,\nsoaking and expanding it,\nuntil through prolonged cultivation,\nits growth is gradual,\nits essence refined like medicine,\nits spirit distilled like elixir?\n\nIs not the *Dao* of preserving life\ntruly found here?\n\nThis is stillness to concentrate the spirit,\nmovement to generate the *qi*—\nto guard the center,\nto live in the *yang* (陽) as the child of time.\n\nFrom this, ascending and descending,\nreturning all to the furnace within,\ngradually refining, gradually distilling,\ngradually distilling, gradually concentrating—\nnothing but a single, undivided heart,\nall distractions emptied,\nto preserve this *yang* alone.\n\nThe more one has, the more they heal;\nthe more one empties, the more they empty.\nWith a heart of utter emptiness,\nno thought of fullness clinging—\nthus they can restore the *one true* (真一) *qi*,\nand attain the *constant Dao* (真常之道).\n\nWhat does *\"能敝不新成\"* mean?\nIt is that what is newly formed\nwill soon decay,\nbut here, decay is impossible—\ndecay marks its traces,\nno decay marks its spirit.\n\nOne true essence contained within,\nten thousand spirits manifest without—\nits subtlety and profundity,\nits mysterious penetration,\nare indeed as such.\n\nThe seven sentences beginning with *\"若\"* (if)\nall borrow external forms to depict the Dao’s marvels,\ntruly revealing its profound and unfathomable depths.\n\nThe sentences beginning with *\"孰能\"* (who can)\nspeak to those seeking to enter the Dao\nyet failing to cultivate virtue.\n\nTurbidity cannot be clarified,\nyet stillness preserves the heart’s purity;\ntranquility is precious when enduring,\nyet movement reveals the spirit’s boundless wisdom.\n\nFullness invites loss,\nso one must not crave excess;\nnovelty decays swiftly,\nso one must not cling to the new.\n\nI hope the seeker may be empty yet dignified,\nuncarved yet unpolished,\nvast and boundless (*hunhun huānghuāng* 浑浑灏灏),\never displaying the sincere and trustworthy winds of virtue—\nthen no heart will fail to transform into Dao-heart,\nno *qi* will remain unaltered into true *qi*.\n\nDo not hesitate, thinking it too profound to measure—\npress forward without delay!\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Ultimate Emptiness and Sincere Stillness**\n*Extreme emptiness, sincere stillness.*\nGuard the utmost emptiness,\npreserve the deepest stillness.\nAll things arise together,\nand I observe their return.\n\nThings are myriad,\neach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is stillness,\nstillness is restoring the vital breath.\nRestoring the vital breath is constancy,\nknowing constancy is enlightenment.\nIgnorance of constancy brings reckless action—disaster.\nKnowing constancy brings tolerance,\ntolerance brings impartiality,\nimpartiality brings sovereignty,\nsovereignty aligns with the heavens,\nthe heavens embody the Dao,\nthe Dao endures eternally—\nliving a life undying in truth.\n\nIf one seeks to cultivate the great Dao,\nto become a *golden immortal* (金仙),\nenduring countless eons without decay,\nfrom the very first step,\nthey must not fail to grasp its root.\n\nWhat is the root?\nIt is the *mysterious pass* (玄关窍).\n\nCultivating truth and refining the Dao\nis not a single path—\nhow can this *mysterious pass* alone contain all its essence?\n\nFor the heavens have their heavenly root,\nthings have their roots of origin,\nhumans have their human sources—\nnever has one achieved supreme attainment,\nor immortal deeds,\nwithout a foundation.\n\nObserve the heavens and earth before their opening—\nindeed, they were vast and silent, without sound.\nAfter their unfolding,\nthey became boundless and limitless.\n\nIs this the heavenly root?\nThe boundless and formless,\nindeed, cannot be called the heavenly root.\nIs this the heavenly root?\nThe flourishing and endless,\nalso cannot be named the heavenly root.\n\nThen where is this root?\nIt lies in the moment of *impending opening* (將開未開).\n\nObserve humanity before birth—\nindeed, they were faint and indistinct, without form.\nAfter birth,\nthey proliferate endlessly, without end.\n\nIs this the root before birth?\nThe indistinct and unshaped,\nindeed, cannot be called the root of humanity.\nIs this the root after birth?\nThe ever-changing and boundless,\nalso cannot be seen as the root of humanity.\n\nThen where is this root?\nIt lies in the moment of *impending birth* (將生未生).\n\nTo cultivate the great Dao,\ncan one ignore this *mysterious pass* and act recklessly?\n\nThe *Tàishàng* (太上) teaches the method of nurturing the Dao and seeking the mysterious:\n*\"Extreme emptiness, sincere stillness,\nand I observe their return.\"*\n\nThis is the key for the aspirant to attain the *mysterious pass*—\nonly by withdrawing all superficiality,\nreturning to the sincere and solid,\nconcentrating the spirit in emptiness,\nnurturing the *qi* in stillness,\nreaching the utmost emptiness,\npreserving the deepest stillness—\nwill all phenomena naturally dissolve,\nand one true essence be held within.»\n\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"Return reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nMaster Zhāo further states:\n*\"At the midpoint of the Winter Solstice,\nthe Heavenly Root reaches its utmost subtlety.\nWhen the first Yang stirs,\nall things begin to be born.\nThis is when Heavenly Principle returns—\nthe ancients likened it to the *active child hour* (活子时).\nIt is also said:\n*'When the first Yang emerges,\nthe dim and murky awaken.'*\n\nThis is precisely the moment when all things return to their rectitude,\nwhen Heaven and Earth renew their cycle.\nHere, the primordial *ancestral qi* of the Pre-Heavenly First Beginning\ncan be keenly observed.\n\nYet its mechanism is exceedingly subtle,\nits qi exceedingly swift—\nit is present now, but gone in an instant.\nLike lightning or a spark,\nit vanishes in the blink of an eye.\n\nObserve the grasses and trees:\nWhen they flourish in form—\nbranches and leaves,\nradiant and vivid—\nall their splendor and order\nare insufficient as the root of rebirth,\nthe origin of renewal.\nOnly when they withdraw and return,\ntransforming life into death,\ndo they bear fruit and return to their roots—\njust as the adept’s *elixir head* (丹头) does.\n\nWhen they return to their roots,\nthey also return from motion to stillness.\nOnce returned to stillness,\nthey once again descend to the initial moment of seeding—\nfor things, this is returning to their origin;\nfor humanity, this is restoring one’s mandate.\nIt is no different.\n\nSpring and autumn pass—\nthe old gives way to the new;\nlife and death alternate—\nflowers bloom and then wither.\nThus, the adept’s way of restoring one’s mandate\nis also the interplay of Heaven and Earth’s two *qi*,\nthe natural flow of a single *qi*—\nthe most ordinary, most constant of ways.\n\nTo know the constant is to grasp the Great Dao.\nFrom here, one’s practice will not stray.\n\nYet the world’s deviant paths—\nignoring the roots of the Great Dao,\nunwilling to purify the mind and clear the thoughts,\nto investigate origins and return to fundamentals—\nsome refine the nature of perception,\nsome cultivate the *qi* of form,\nsome gather seven metals and eight stones as medicine,\nsome take young boys and girls to forge the elixir—\nwith no foundation, how can the Dao be obtained?\nMoreover, fixated on one extreme,\nthey stray into false paths,\nand many meet ruin in body and life.\nAll this stems from not knowing the Dao as the constant,\nthus seeking hidden wonders,\ntreading perilous paths,\nand inviting misfortune.\n\nOnly when one knows the Dao as true and eternal—\npresent in all people, sufficient in all things—\ndoes one not rejoice in knowing it,\nnor marvel at possessing it.\nLike water and fire to humanity,\nit is taken and used freely.\nIn emptiness, it is boundless in capacity;\nto all things, it is equally impartial—\na heart of boundless fairness.\n\nSuch fairness without selfishness\nis akin to the Sage.\n*\"My people, my kin; all things, my companions.\"*\nStanding with Heaven and Earth as foundation,\nuniting all things in a single source—\nhow could this not be one with Heaven?\n\nHeaven is the Dao; the Dao is Heaven.\nBeyond Heaven, there is no Dao;\nbeyond the Dao, there is no Heaven.\nOnly Heaven is supreme;\nonly the Sage follows its law.\nOnly the Dao is exalted;\nonly Heaven is its model.\n\nThus, humanity has birth and death,\nbut the Dao endures eternally, unspent.\nEven in transcendence or shedding the shell,\nthere comes a time of decline.\nYet though the form perishes, the spirit does not;\nthough the body is lost, the *qi* is not lost.\n\nThe *Shī* says:\n*\"The King stands above,\nilluminating Heaven.\"*\nIs this not what is meant?\n\nAll this comes from attaining *extreme emptiness* and *sincere stillness*,\nobserving the signs of Return—\nthus achieving the unfathomable.\n\nScholars dare not neglect the root and act recklessly, inviting disaster.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* teaches the fundamental practice,\nthe essential study of the head and mind.\nWhere one gains strength here,\nstrength is gained everywhere.\nIf scholars grasp this meaning,\nthey will diligently adhere to the rule,\nunceasingly, from non-being to being,\nfrom being to non-being—\neven in a single breath,\nthe root of the Great Dao is present;\neven in a meal’s time,\nthe First Beginning of the Great Dao is preserved.\n\nFrom this single thread of subtle mechanism,\ngathering and refining it,\ngradually it swells into an unstoppable vigor—\nall from the accumulation of that first Yang.\n\nEven if the mighty *qi* fills Heaven and Earth,\nif the Yang spirit pierces the constellations of *Dòu* and *Niú*,\nwhat is it not the result of this true *qi*?\n\nThe student who fails to obtain this true *qi*\nand instead refines the post-Heavenly form and spirit\nis but a single hair from nine oxen,\na grain from the sea—\nhow dare they compare with Heaven and Earth?\n\nOnly by walking this path and uniting with Heaven and Earth\ncan one endure for billions of years unbroken.\nThe adept must earnestly grasp the core principle,\nseizing the moment without loss.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Work Completed, the Body Fulfilled**\n\nThe *Tàishàng* says:\n*\"The highest does not know its existence\"* (others render this as *\"The lowest knows its existence\"*, but it contradicts the text’s intent—an error in transmission);\nNext, it is honored and praised;\nNext, it is feared;\nNext, it is insulted.\nWhen trust is insufficient,\nthere is distrust.\n*\"Ah, how precious are words!\"*\nWhen the work is complete and the matter fulfilled,\nthe people all say, *\"This is natural.\"*\n\n(*\"Ah, how precious\"*—this speaks of ease and sincerity,\nthe careful weight of one’s declarations.)\n\nThe **Dao** of the **Tàishàng** in cultivating the body is the same as the **Dao** of governing the world—nothing more than **one true essence**.\n\nWhen this **true essence** is held within, the self is refined;\nwhen it responds to all things, all things are fulfilled.\nThough there may be distinctions between inner and outer, self and others,\nthis **true essence** of the heart remains unchanging.\n\nIf a person attains **sincerity** without ceasing,\nthen the response of others is also unceasing.\nIf **sincerity** falters even slightly,\nthen the response of things is also impaired.\n\nFor all share this heart,\nand this heart shares this principle:\nCultivate the self, and the world naturally harmonizes;\nlose the **true essence**, and the world must descend into chaos.\nFrom the **Three Sovereigns** and **Five Emperors** down to the present,\nthere has never been any deviation.\n\nThe **Tàishàng** desires that people refine themselves through the **Dao** of **sincerity and trust**,\nand likewise govern others through it.\nUnseen yet manifest,\nunstirred yet transformative,\neffortless yet accomplished—\nTo the self, there is no conscious method of governance;\nto others, it is felt as subtle influence and transformation,\nunaware of its own workings.\nThis was the pure wind of antiquity—\nI have long failed to behold it.\n\nThus the **Tàishàng** says:\n*\"The highest does not know its existence.\"*\nWhen ruler and people rejoice together in the radiant light of Heaven and Earth,\nhow could such divine transformation exist\nwithout the abiding **sincerity and trust**?\n\nAs the noble winds of antiquity have faded,\nthe **Tàishàng’s** perfect governance is unheard of,\nand the world’s customs decline further,\nthe **Great Dao** growing ever more estranged—\nto the point where even speech and sight cannot bear witness.\n\nIf one is not far removed from antiquity,\nthis **Dao** may still linger,\nhuman nature not yet corrupted,\n**true sincerity** yet remaining—\nthough not the profound sincerity of the most ancient times,\nit still shines as the brilliance of the present age.\nThe same governance, yet one achieves transformation without effort,\nwhile another applies benevolence with deliberate intent.\n\nTo cherish the people as one’s own children,\nto love them as family—\nin such times, reverence for the worthy and respect for elders\ncomes naturally, like echoes in response.\nEven if trust is not perfectly aligned,\nvirtuous transformation cannot be fully uniform—\nyet through affection and love,\nthrough encouragement and praise,\nwithout harsh words or threats,\none inspires them to cherish virtue and fear authority.\nThough not attaining the **Tàishàng’s** level,\nthis still follows the **Dao** and the path—\nwhat is called *\"When the Great Dao is abandoned, there arises benevolence and righteousness.\"*\n\nWhen the **Sovereign** descends to **Emperor**,\nand the **Emperor** to **King**,\nall still govern through the **virtue/power** of knowing **Dao** and practicing the **Way of the King**.\n\nAs ancient customs fade further,\nthe **Great Dao** grows ever more neglected,\n**Kings** descend to **Conquerors**,\npretending to uphold the **true essence**,\neach heart its own,\neach perspective its own—\nfar removed from the **Emperor’s** and **King’s** unified **virtue/power** of trust.\n\nThus, though rituals, teachings, laws, and decrees remain,\nthe **true essence** of the heart is utterly different.\nOnly through talent and cunning does one govern the world,\nrelying on laws and measures to guide the people—\nif their actions are appropriate and measures lawful,\nthe people fear to break the law or violate the rules,\nand such a ruler is deemed clever,\nhis age one of great peace.\n\nYet lower still—\nthose who rely on cleverness to drive the people,\nwho use deceit to rule the masses,\nwith deceitful and cunning hearts,\nemploying deceitful and cunning governance—\nwhen they boast arrogantly, satisfied with their schemes,\nnone dare say they are not wiser than the **Three Kings** or more talented than the **Five Conquerors**,\nyet the people of this age\nlive in constant dread, even in the dead of night,\nfor their oppression is indeed severe.\nThough the people dare not speak,\ntheir hearts are alienated,\nand there is never a moment of true governance—\nthus disaster and chaos follow swiftly.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"When the ruler values trust, the people act with sincerity.\"*\nIf trust is lacking within oneself,\nhow can one expect trust from the people?\nThis is how ruler and subjects deceive and betray one another.\n\nThough institutions, decrees, teachings, and commands\nare not abandoned even by the Sage,\nyet sincerity and deceit differ,\nand their responses are distinct.\nOnly when the **Emperor** or **King** sets the example,\ninspiring trust in the people,\ndo laws stand firm and governance succeed,\nwords carry weight, and the people believe—\nultimately radiating brilliance to the four quarters,\naccomplishing the work and fulfilling the task,\nas with **Yao** transforming the times through **Yong**,\nor **Shun** governing through effortless **non-action**,\nwhile the people say, *\"This is natural.\"*\n\nAh!\nThis is the reach of **true trust**—\nhow vast the difference\nbetween this and those who lack trust within!\n\nThe **Dao** of **virtue/power** is a single thread,\npermeating all things—\ncultivating the self is here,\ngoverning the world is here,\nand all affairs of the world and all things\nfall within this scope.\n\nEven in this chapter’s *\"Tàishàng\"*—\nit speaks of the highest person\nembracing the highest nature,\nthus called *\"Tàishàng.\"*\n**Supreme virtue** is pure, untouched, and non-acting;\nthe six senses are steadied.\nNext, through reverence and love, one transforms the people—\nsensing, one responds.\nNext, through awe and severity, one governs the world.\nNext, through cleverness, one guides the people—\nthis is called *\"artifice.\"*\nYet its most refined essence is **trust**.\n**Trust** belongs to **Earth**—\nthroughout cultivation, its wondrous use lies in **Earth’s sincerity**.\nThus the **Tàishàng** says:\n*\"Its essence is most true, within it lies **trust\"**—\nthis is the **elixir’s foundation**.\n**Trust** is nothing but **sincerity**.\nIf a person attains **sincerity** without ceasing,\nthen the **elixir** as **elixir** is already within.\n\nYet **trust** and deceit are ever so close—\none moment of mindfulness makes a sage,\none moment of negligence makes a fool.\nThe divide between humanity and beasts,\nlife and death—\nit hinges on but a breath.\n\nI wish the later generations would seek **true trust**\nas the **constant Dao**.\n\nWhere is **trust** found?\nIt is the **Mystic Pass**, the single aperture—\ndo people know it?\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Abandoned**\n\nWhen the **Great Dao** is abandoned,\nthere arises **benevolence and righteousness**.\nWhen **wisdom** emerges,\nthere arises **great deceit**.\nWhen familial bonds fracture,\nthere arises **filial piety and affection**.\nWhen the state falls into confusion,\nthere arise **loyal ministers**.\n\nObserve the ancient world:\ncustoms were sincere and unadorned,\npeople were simple and unrefined,\neach followed their nature,\nfulfilled their destiny,\nsettled into their ways,\ntook joy in their labors—\nlike things moving with Heaven,\nacting in accordance with nature,\nrequiring no contrivance or arrangement,\nfollowing the natural course of their being,\nunaware of why it was so.\n\nZhuangzi spoke of those burdened with the weight of ritual and law—\ntheir clumsy sincerity, their weary toil,\nmoving in harmony with Heaven,\nrich with genuine intent.\n\nThis is how they remain unknowing and unknowable,\nfollowing the patterns of the **Dao**.\n\nWhat kind of transformation is this?\n\nNothing more than a **mystic unity**—\nunthinking, carefree,\none with the **Great Dao**.\n\nYet as the **Imperial Way** declines,\nthe **Great Dao** fades further,\nand those in power speak of **benevolence and righteousness**,\ndiligently performing their duties,\ndaring not to stray.\n\nTo dwell in **righteousness** and practice **benevolence**—\nthis too is the noble deed of sages,\nnot entirely to be condemned.\nBut compared to ancient times of flourishing **Dao**,\nwhen the **Great Dao** shone bright,\nand hearts were simple and unadorned,\n**benevolence and righteousness** existing naturally within—\nhow vast the difference!\n\nThus, the **Ancient Sage** sighed:\n*\"When the **Great Dao** is abandoned,\nthere arises **benevolence and righteousness**.\"*\n\nFrom this, both rulers and subjects\ncovet the name of **benevolence and righteousness**,\nwhile hypocrites exploit them for deceit.\nThough **benevolence and righteousness** remain,\ntheir practice has decayed.\nIs this the fault of **benevolence and righteousness** itself?\nRather, it is the harm wrought by those\nwho force interpretations upon them,\nwho cling to **righteousness** and are ensnared by **benevolence**.\n\nStill, they speak of **benevolence and righteousness**—\nthough not the true **Dao**,\nthey have not yet reached **great deceit**.\n\nAfter this, customs grew ever more perverse,\nhearts ever more corrupt.\nEven the transmission of **benevolence and righteousness**\nwas nearly lost.\nNow, in court and countryside, among rulers and subjects,\nall flaunt their **wisdom** and display their **cleverness**—\nwithin these exchanges,\ndeceit and trickery prevail.\nHow can they hope to govern their families or states?\n\nThus, father and son grow estranged,\nbrothers quarrel,\neven husbands and wives, friends and neighbors—\neach with their own heart, their own perspective—\nbarely resembling the harmony of **Hu and Yue**,\nlet alone greater unity!\nIf a son proves filial, the court rewards him;\nif a father shows kindness, the village praises him.\nAlas! **Filial piety** and **parental kindness**—\nthese are the eternal laws of Heaven and Earth,\nthe natural order of the home.\nWhy should they be singled out for praise?\n\nYet when **six relationships** are fractured,\nwhile disobedience spreads,\nand family strife erupts—\nthen those who practice **filial piety** and **parental kindness**\nare held up with solemn reverence,\ntheir deeds displayed to inspire the world.\nHow far this falls from the **Ancient Sage’s** golden age,\nwhen **filial piety** was natural,\nwhen **parental kindness** required no name!\n\nStill, even this **filial piety** and **parental kindness**\nare but responses to discord—\nyet today’s world prefers ornamentation,\nempty display,\nwhere those who claim **filial piety** and **parental kindness**\nare countless.\n\nAnd after the **Five Hegemons**,\nkin slaughtered kin,\nlords took hostages of their rulers—\nno wonder tyrants ruled above,\nwhile insolent ministers defied below,\nand the state fell into chaos.\nFortunately, **loyal ministers** arose to stabilize the land,\nthough success or failure could not be foreseen—\ntheir devotion exhausted, their loyalty unyielding.\nSome, like **Zhuge Liang’s** six expeditions to Qishan,\nor **Jiang Ziya’s** nine campaigns into the Central Plains,\ncould not reverse fate with force,\nnor preserve the realm with their hearts.\n\nFor ministers serve their lords—\nthey wish to be **good ministers**, not **loyal ones**.\nIf fortune favors peace,\nthey share in governing the state;\nif war erupts,\nthey display their talents to aid the world.\nWhen the age is corrupt,\nHeaven reveals **loyal ministers**;\nwhen **loyal ministers** appear,\nHeaven sustains the corruption.\nYet even if **loyal ministers** restore order,\ntransforming martial fury into a realm of **ritual and propriety**—\nthis still falls short of the **Ancient Sage’s** era of effortless harmony.\n\nAlas! **Loyal ministers** would prefer obscurity—\notherwise, one man’s loyalty brings ruin to the land.\nThis is the **Ancient Sage’s** lament for the times,\nhis sorrow for the present, his longing for the past,\nwishing all—rulers and subjects—\nto return to **primordial simplicity**,\nto **unknowing unity**:\ntheir **virtue** unbroken, their desires none,\ntheir **Way** ever sufficient—\ncontent, serene,\nall dwelling in effortless peace,\nunaware of their path.\n\nEven **benevolence, wisdom, filial piety, loyal ministers**—\nall are taken as given,\ntheir existence unspoken, their names unspoken—\nwhat greater **simplicity** is there?\n\nThough this speaks to governance,\nit also applies to self-cultivation.\nThe opening lines describe a **primordial age**,\nuntouched by artifice,\nlike the **uncarved block**—\nno effort required,\nthe **Dao** complete in itself.\n\nBut once the **original nature** is lost,\none must borrow from **pre-Heaven yin and yang** to restore it.\n**Yin and yang** are **benevolence and righteousness**—\nthe saying *\"When the **Great Dao** is abandoned,\nthere arises **benevolence and righteousness**.\"*\n\nTo discern the true **qi** within and without,\nto nourish with **wisdom** what is pure—\nthis is not entirely authentic,\nfor it mixes with **post-Heaven** influences,\nand cannot avoid **deceit**.\nThis is the meaning of:\n*\"When **wisdom** emerges,\nthere arises **great deceit**.\"*\n\nAs for **nourishing yin to balance yang**—\nthis reconciles the **six senses**,\nrestoring **great harmony**—\nthe metaphor of **filial piety and kindness**.\n\nThrough **vigorous tempering and refining**—\nthis calms the **inner chaos**,\nelevating to **clarity**—\nthe essence of **loyal ministers**.\n\nUnderstand this, and the **Dao** is near.\nWhat greater **Way** is there than\nfollowing one’s **original, uncarved nature**?\nThose who cultivate do so by this alone.\n\n**Chapter Nineteenth: Minimal Self-Interest and Desires**\n\n*\"Few in self-interest, scant in desires,\nabandon **saintly wisdom** and discard **wisdom**,\nthe people’s benefit grows a hundredfold;\nabandon **virtue** and cast aside **righteousness**,\nthe people return to **filial piety and kindness**.\n\nDiscard **artifice** and forsake **profit**,\nand thieves and robbers vanish.\nThese three **refinements** are insufficient,\nso they must be paired with their **essences**:\n*seeing the unadorned and embracing the uncarved*,\nfew in self-interest, scant in desires,\nabandon learning to be free of cares.\n\nUnder the heavens, the multitude of people and things,\nthe **accomplished and unaccomplished**, noble and base—\nall unequal,\nyet none escape the **principle of Dao** and the **flow of qi**,\nmerely differing in how they are **penetrated**.\n\nWhen their **nature** is **obstructed** and **not in harmony**,\nwhen **emotions** clash and **intentions** are blocked,\nit is because those above lack means to **inspire**,\nand those below lack means to **transform**.\n\nIn ancient times, the **most sage rulers**,\nfollowing **Nature’s Dao**,\npracticed **effortless governance**,\nneither delighting in **actions** for the sake of **achievement**,\nnor wearying of **actions** to neglect **government**.\n\nThough they possessed **brilliant wisdom**,\nthey **encompassed all within the realm of effortlessness**,\nin the **pure and tranquil abode**,\nso that those below, observing and being **transformed**,\nnaturally **honored their kin**,\n**extended their elders**,\n**settled their customs**,\nand **found joy in their livelihoods**,\nwith none failing to return to their **original nature**,\nand none **unfulfilled** in their **growth**.\n\nThis was the **age of antiquity**,\nwhen people were all **sincere and thick**,\nand things **proliferated abundantly**—\ntheir benefit was indeed more than a hundredfold!\n\nAs for the **most virtuous

unrestrained**,\n**unadorned and pure**,\nthey **neither spoke of right and wrong**,\nnor **straight and crooked**,\nyet **followed Heaven’s movement**,\n**conformed to Nature’s course**,\nnaturally **without favor or bias**,\nreturning to the **domain of Great Centrality and Rectitude**.\n\nWhen the people **observed, were inspired, and transformed**,\nas sons they **naturally practiced filial piety toward their parents**,\nas fathers they **naturally showed kindness to their children**.\nThough there were **unfilial and unkind** individuals,\naccustomed to such **habits**,\nthey too **gradually transformed**—\nhow **prosperous** was this!\n\nLater generations of **rulers with peerless brilliance**,\n**exceptional acuity**,\nyet who **governed with artifice**,\ndid not **understand the Dao’s foundation of effortlessness**—\n**guiding** it was easy,\n**contradicting** it was difficult.\nThus some **delighted in frequent changes**, disturbing the people,\n**establishing laws and regulations**,\nultimately leading to **national calamities**,\nwhere the people **barely survived**.\n\nSome **loved martial exploits**, neglecting governance,\n**exhausting armies and waging wanton wars**,\nending with **empty treasuries**,\nthe people **unable to bear their fate**—\nno wonder then that **poverty and national decline** arose,\nthat **plundering and banditry** spread,\nand **thieves and robbers ran rampant** under Heaven.\n\nSuch rulers,\n**masters of artifice**,\ndid not **know to wield their cleverness** in **effortless Heaven**,\n**effortless Earth**,\nbut **coveted profit** to enrich the state,\nleading to **waning national strength**,\n**disturbed customs**—\nsuch was their folly.\n\nIf they could **discard artifice while embodying it**,\nexpressing their **true intent**,\n**following the natural course**,\n**rectifying the dharma without scheming for profit**,\n**illuminating the Dao without calculating achievements**,\nthen the **virtue of the noble** would be **wind**,\nthe **virtue of the petty** would be **grass**—\nnaturally, like **water flowing downward**,\nor **fire blazing upward**,\nthere would be **what could not be restrained**.\n\nIn such times, would the people still\n**ignore propriety and shame**,\n**commit theft and robbery**, or **pursue what is not right**?\nNone would.\n\nThis is **great wisdom as if foolish**,\n**great virtue as if enduring**,\n**great artifice as if clumsy**—\nlater generations, seeing this,\nwould deem them **unfit to be rulers**,\n**unfit to govern**.\n\nYet the **pervasive influence of sage virtue**,\nthe **reaching of benevolent grace**,\nthe **application of wisdom and artifice**,\nthough lacking in **external adornment**,\nhad **far greater substance within**.\n\n**Desires and principles** originally **do not conspire**—\nsufficiency in **external adornment** is **suspect within**,\n**reducing ornamentation** only **enriches the essence**.\nThe **sage abandons wisdom**,\nthe **virtuous abandon righteousness**,\nthe **artful abandon profit**—\nall to **strengthen substance**,\n**discard ornamentation**.\n\nThough the people below are **utterly foolish**,\nthey **constantly take the ruler’s actions** as their **guide**.\nThus, **rejecting adornment and valuing substance**,\nit **naturally unifies the petty people’s hearts** in the **original source**,\n**untouched and uncarved**.\n\nFor they **see only governance of unadorned substance**,\nand thus **embrace** the **true uncarved simplicity**.\nSuch **wholeness and naturalness**—\nclothing and food,\neach **settled in its proper way**;\n**reciprocal courtesy and exchanges**,\neach **conforming to its due measure**.\nThough their **qi and constitution** are limited,\nthey **cannot fully prevent** the **sprouting of self-interest and desires**,\nyet these would be **few and scant**.\n\nIn sum:\n**Sainthood, virtue, artifice**—\nall are **substance**;\n**wisdom, righteousness, profit**—\nall are **ornamentation**.\nAbandoning **sainthood and discarding wisdom**,\nabandoning **virtue and discarding righteousness**,\nabandoning **artifice and discarding profit**—\nall to **ensure ornamentation is insufficient**,\n**substance remains abundant**,\neach **with its proper domain**.\n\nWhen the people **nourish themselves on virtue**,\n**drink in harmony** from within—\nhow could they **not benefit endlessly**,\nwith **filial piety and kindness daily flourishing**,\nand **theft transformed into goodness**?\n\nThis **prosperous governance**,\nI have long failed to **behold**.\n\nThis **parable of cultivation**—\nfirst, **preserve the heart and nurture the nature**,\nwhen **heart and nature return to their original state**,\nthen the **post-Heaven qi and essence**\nalso **return to the pre-Heaven qi and essence**.\n\nIf one **has not yet seen the nature and clarified the heart**,\nbut **merely uses the post-Heaven constitution and qi**,\nor the **sensate heart and awareness**,\nthen the **refined essence is but common essence**,\nthe **qi is but common qi**—\nhow could one **obtain the true unified essence**,\nthe **true unified qi** to **forge the elixir**?\n\nCultivators must **seek from the source** a **great fundamental principle**,\na **true head of understanding**,\nto **take command**.\nThen **refining essence, tempering qi, and purifying spirit**—\nall would be **achieved**.\n\nWhen this **meaning is awakened**,\nnot only would one **understand the Classic of the Most High**,\n**govern the world and cultivate the self**—\neverywhere **a single thread**—\nbut also the **Four Books and Five Classics**,\nnone would **not be elixir texts**.\n\nOther commentaries say:\nWhen those above **abandon sainthood and wisdom**,\nthe people **only know profit**,\nso those **seeking profit** increase a hundredfold;\nwhen they **abandon virtue and righteousness**,\nthe people **do not know to love their kin**,\nso they **greatly oppose filial piety and kindness**—\nthis is **what should not be abandoned** yet is abandoned,\nand such are its **harmful effects**.\"\n\nWhen it comes to **crafty profit, sainthood, wisdom, and virtue clashing with righteousness**—\nif one can **sever and abandon them**,\nthen where would thieves and robbers arise?\nThis is **what should be abandoned** and is abandoned—\nits **effects** are thus.\n\nThis **discourse is truly \"high.\"**\n\nBelow these three, it means:\n**Governing the people does not require decrees**—\nonly that **commands must originate from what is personally practiced and aligned with**.\nSeeing **unadorned simplicity** brings **determination**,\nembracing **rough jade** preserves **spirit**—\nfew desires, little private gain—\nthis is **\"holding the world yet not partaking\"**,\nnot the **abundant transformation of non-action**—\nhow could one **ever attain this**?\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Differing from Others**\n**Abandoning learning brings no sorrow.**\n\nHow far apart are **\"yes\"** and **\"ah\"**?\nHow far apart are **\"good\"** and **\"evil\"**?\nWhat people **fear**, one **cannot fail to fear**.\n\nAh! **Its boundlessness knows no end!**\n\nThe crowd bustles and rejoices,\nas if feasting on **the grandest sacrificial meat**,\nas if ascending **Spring Terrace**—\nI alone remain **serene and unmarked**,\nlike an infant **yet unborn** (before leaving the womb).\n**Drifting, drifting**—\nas if **having nowhere to return** (untouched by traces)!\n\nThe crowd all **have excess**,\nwhile I alone seem **forsaken**.\nMy heart is that of a **fool**!\n\n**Muddled**—while the vulgar are **bright**,\nI alone am **dim**;\nthe vulgar are **sharp-sighted**,\nI alone am **obscured**.\n\n**Dull**—like the sea’s **indifference to external desire**,\n**whirling**—like **no fixed form**,\nthe crowd all **have purpose**,\nwhile I alone am **stubborn and crude**.\n\nI alone **differ from others**,\nyet **nourish at the Mother’s breast**.\n\nThe **Sage’s attainment is supreme**,\ncalled **\"Abandoning Learning.\"**\nPure **vital impulse** flows unrestrained—\nno thought, no worry.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"The Most High watches over you—\ndo not let your heart be divided.\"*\n\nThus, **acting from one’s natural station**,\none **indifferently accepts** poverty or wealth, gain or loss—\nnowhere **not at ease**—\nso it is said: **\"no sorrow.\"**\n\nSuch a realm—\ncompared to the **unlearned and unskilled**—\nis **not merely a chasm**,\nyet the gap is **not distant**.\n\nLike **echoes**—\nboth respond, yet **\"yes\"** is direct while **\"ah\"** is flattery—\nthe response is the same,\nbut the **source of response**—\nhow far apart are they?\n\nFrom ancient times, the **divide between Sage and commoner**\nlies only in **good and evil**—\nand the distinction between them\nrests solely on **reverence or licentiousness**,\na contest of **a single thought**—\nhow far apart are they?\n\nFor **human-heartedness is perilous**,\n**Dao-heartedness is subtle**—\na hair’s breadth of difference\nleads to **thousands of miles of error**.\nWhat people **dread and guard against**,\nI too **cannot fail to fear** what people fear.\n\nThus, from the **first step forward**,\none must **withdraw and gather spirit-light**,\nreturning it to **primordial chaos**—\nwhether in **action or stillness**,\nin **change or constancy**,\nall as **the age of Great Void**,\nbefore Heaven and Earth were cleaved—\nvast and boundless,\nas if **night had no end**.\n\nThus, **within there is a master**,\nwhile **external things do not disturb**.\n\nWhen applied to **governance and decrees**,\nthe people naturally **transform and thrive**.\nThose who **feed on the Sage’s virtue**\nfeast as if on **the grandest sacrificial meat**;\nthose who **dwell in the Sage’s domain**\nrejoice as if on **Spring Terrace**—\nhow could this be compared\nto **lonely cultivation in quietude**?\n\nThus, **fulfilling the world yet unaware of merit**,\n**acting in the world yet unaware of deeds**—\nwhile the crowd **takes delight**,\nI alone am **dull and tranquil**, **faint as mist**.\n\nLike an infant **still in the womb**,\nbefore birth—\na **cluster of primordial qi**,\n**wholly embraced**,\nrising and falling, circulating without end—\n**harmonizing with Heaven and Earth**,\n**unaware of its destination**.\n\nOthers **act**, while I **do not**—\nthe crowd **has excess to sustain them**,\nwhile I **stand alone, abandoned by the world**,\nfar beyond what others can reach.\n\nFrom their view, few would not call me **foolish**;\nyet **turning inward**, I only feel **my heart cleansed and hidden in depth**,\n**at ease with Heaven, accepting my fate**—\nhow could this be the heart of a fool?\n\nIt is merely **great wisdom as folly**,\n**great skill as clumsiness**.\n\nOtherwise, how could I **bring such joy to labor and peace to dwelling**,\nmoving people so swiftly toward **spirit-transformation**?\n\nSuch is **the Great Polarity**, a **whirling chaos** held in embrace—\n**muddled**, like a **chicken’s egg yet unhatched**,\nwith **no trace of yin or yang**,\n**no knowledge at all**.\n\nThe vulgar are **brightly discerning** in all things,\nwhile I alone am **dimly unaware**;\nthe vulgar are **keenly perceptive** in all things,\nwhile I alone am **obscured in ignorance**.\n\nAm I truly **dim and ignorant**,\n**obscured and unaware**?\nRather, it is **hiding one’s traces and concealing one’s light**,\n**embedding clarity in depth**—\nday by day, month by month,\n**refining the elixir through nine transformations**,\n**reaching the Sage’s virtue**,\nand becoming **an immortal unchanging through the ages**.\n\nIts **vast transformation** is like **Heaven and Earth’s dimness**,\n**embracing all phenomena within thought**.\n\nIts **subtle spirit** is like **flowing clouds and water**—\n**no fixed place**,\n**nurturing all life within**.\n\nFrom the **outside**, the crowd all **have purpose in the world**,\nwhile I alone am **stubborn and crude**.\nYet **within**—\nthe **Way is high and beautiful**,\n**transcending the masses**,\n**unmatched and uniquely Sage**.\n\nThis is how I **differ from others**,\n**unreachable by people**.\n\nFor **commoners scatter outward**,\nlosing their **original Heavenly nature**,\nwhile **Sages cultivate inwardly**,\n**preserving their inherent nature**.\n\nThe **Sage differs from the commoner**—\nall because **later Heaven returns to Earlier Heaven**.\n\nLater Heaven is **emotion**—**child’s qi**;\nEarlier Heaven is **nature**—**Mother’s qi**.\nReturning from **emotion to nature**,\njust as a child **clings to its mother**,\n**reluctant to part**—\nthus it is said: **\"Noble is the one who seeks nourishment at the Mother’s breast.\"**\n\nMencius said: *\"The Way of learning and inquiry is nothing else—\nmerely the recovery of the lost heart.\"*\n\nThe distinction between Sage and madman lies in but a single thought.\nIs the Dao so distant?\nAre the methods so numerous?\nIf one seeks the Way,\nand does not seek it in the boundless, formless moment—\nwhere else shall they apply themselves?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The Dark Mother, the Dark Mother—\ntruly the Dark Mother.\nNot in the heart, nor in the kidneys.\nInvestigate the origin of life and the receipt of fate—\ndo not blame the Heavenly mechanism for being fully revealed.\"*\n\nWhat is there at the origin of life?\nReflect upon this,\nand the Way is half attained.\n\nFirst, it is said that the Sage abandons learning.\nAlready possessing eternal joy and inner stillness,\nfree from worry and care,\ndaily actions and habits all return to the undifferentiated Heaven.\nUntouched, uncarved,\nunsoiled, unstained—\nthat which, when gazed upon, grows ever higher,\nbeyond all measure,\ntruly that which may be aspired to but never reached.\n\nYet though the effort is so extreme,\nthe true divide lies only in the distinction between reverence and licentiousness.\nCan one fear its profundity and retreat in hesitation?\n\nYanzi said: *\"What kind of person was Shun? What kind of person am I?\nThose who act likewise are no different.\"*\nThis is no falsehood.\n\nYet it is not the empty, idle learning of the vulgar.\nThe Sage cultivates innate virtue to renew the people,\nletting all beings nourish themselves on virtue and drink in harmony,\nplaying in the radiant light of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThis Way—what Way is it?\nThe Way of utmost sincerity,\nexhausting the nature of Self, of humanity, of things.\nAh!\nWhen nature is thus exhausted,\nwhat more is there to learn?\nIt is nothing but nourishing on the Mother’s qi.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 21: The Container of the Great Virtue**\n\nThe Container of the Great Virtue\nfollows only the Dao.\n\nThe Dao as a thing—\nvague and indistinct.\nIndistinct and vague,\nyet within it there are forms;\nvague and indistinct,\nyet within it there are things.\nDeep and dark,\nyet within it there is essence.\nIts essence is most true,\nand within it there is authenticity.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nits name does not fade,\nas it oversees all things.\n\nHow do I know the state of all things?\nBy this.\n\nThe Container of the Great Virtue\nis the Dark Gateway’s aperture.\nThe ancients said:\n*\"One aperture, the Dark Gateway’s hole—\nHeaven and Earth together formed it.\nWithin it hides the divine qi’s cavern,\nnamed the yin-yang essence.\"*\n\nAgain it is said:\n*\"One aperture, the Dark Gateway’s great door—\nHere, lead is forged and cinnabar refined.\"*\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"These two apertures’ methods—\nthe metallic qi also harmonizes with them.\"*\n\nThus the Dao speaks of *\"the Gate of the Dark Mother,\"*\nthe Confucian of *\"the Gate of Principle and Righteousness,\"*\nthe Buddha of *\"the Gate of Non-Duality.\"*\n\nAll are but the Container of the Great Virtue’s capacity:\nHeaven, Earth, and all things\nare born from within it.\nIt is neither empty nor non-empty,\nneither the Dao nor non-Dao—\nempty and the Dao are one.\nEmpty and the Dao do not separate.\nWithout emptiness, there is no Dao;\nwithout the Dao, there is no emptiness.\nThus it is said:\n*\"It follows only the Dao.\"*\n\nIf one seeks the Dao,\nand abandons this empty vessel—\nwhere else shall they seek?\n\nBut emptiness without form\nis mere vulgar emptiness.\nHow then shall the student gather medicine and refine the elixir?\n\nIt must be empty yet containing ultimate reality,\nnonexistent yet encompassing ultimate existence—\nonly then does it avoid one-sided learning.\n\nThe practitioner, having set aside all concerns,\nrests quietly for a moment,\nobserving this aperture.\nIndistinct, as if nonexistent;\nvague, as if something.\nIn the depths of emptiness and stillness,\nthe divine spark moves—\nthe formless becomes formed.\nThis is the radiance of the Self’s nature,\nthe floating of wood and fire—\nthe initial stirrings of the subtle yang.\n\nAgain, with this divine light’s fleeting movement,\ncontain it with the gaze and direct it downward.\nVague, as if aware;\nindistinct, as if knowing nothing—\nwithin it, the yang essence stirs—\nthis is when the light of yin first meets the palace of yin.\n\nAt this time, the vital force is weak,\nbeyond taking.\nOnly the two stages of the *Adopted Mother* method\nadjust and regulate the errant yin-qi,\nmeeting in the aperture’s center.\nOne stage for adjustment and extraction,\none for returning to the furnace and nourishing.\n\nFollowing the method without pause,\nfire enters water’s depths,\nwater’s gold is born—\ndim and dark, unknown in its extremity,\nthis is when the divine qi merges\nand the yin-yang essence is generated.\n\nYet when true essence is born,\nthe body stands like a wall,\nthe mind like cold ashes—\nnaturally, the whole body softens and rejoices,\nthe essence of limbs and body\nall return to the Dark Aperture.\n\nThere is great authenticity here—\nmelted like ice thawing,\nvast like a tide rising.\nNot like before, indistinct and vague,\nunnameable.\n\nThis true essence\nis truly the One Essence,\nnot the later-Heaven mingled essence that can be compared.\nIt is also the original essence\nfrom which Heaven, Earth, and all things first emerged—\nthe common true essence of all.\n\nLike the winter solstice’s yang,\nthe child’s hour at midnight,\nthe success of a year and a day—\nthough not limited to this,\nthe vital force’s movements all begin here.\n\nAs if a thousand-layered tower\nbegins with a clod of earth,\na ten-thousand-li journey\nbegins with a single step.\n\nThis is the root of Heaven, Earth, and all things’ generation.\nIf the source is misplaced,\nwhat extremity will the outcome reach?\n\nThus, from ancient times to now,\nall who cultivate the Dao\nnever depart from gathering this true qi—\nonly then do the signs of life emerge.\n\nExamining all things at their birth,\nnone differ from this single true essence,\nforming shapes and bodies.\n\nAnd how do I know all things share this?\nBecause within this empty aperture,\ntrue qi accumulates.\nOver time, the Dark Gateway opens\nand true essence is born.\n\nIn essence,\nvagueness is the density of light,\nindistinctness is the subtlety of the mechanism.\nWithin the indistinct and vague—\nthe true yin of the yin-center\nis the thing.\n\n「The true yang within the **Kan** center—\nthis is the essence of the **Yao-Ming**,\nthe subtle and profound.\n\nThe scholar must know this true essence,\nand only then can the practice reach its utmost.\n\nThis vague and indistinct is the nature of light’s effulgent transcendence,\nthus it is said, *“there is form”* (**有象**);\nthis indistinct and vague is the nature of light’s downward illumination upon the **Kan** palace,\nwhere true yang stirs to motion,\nthus it is said, *“there is substance”* (**有物**).\n\nThe essence of **Yao-Ming**—\nthis is the essence of the **Five Agents** (**二五**), hence it is called *most true* (**甚真**).\n\nTo obtain this true essence,\none must first know true faith (**真信**).\n\nTrue faith is when yin and yang alternate in their movements,\nnever missing the timing of their shifts.\nWhen the moment of true faith first arrives,\nthe response must be precise and unerring,\nthen the work of **seizing and subduing** (**擒伏**) will be achieved.\n\nWhen ordinary people first begin cultivation,\nthey must necessarily pass through vague and indistinct **Yao-Ming**,\nbefore the impure desires cease,\nand the natural principle (**天理**) remains constant.\nThe common breath (**凡息**) halts,\nand the true breath (**真息**) appears.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause the human heart is too bright,\nand awareness arises too easily.\n\nIf one reaches **Yao-Ming**,\nwhere awareness does not stir,\nthen the original nature (**元性**) and original life (**元命**)\nmerge into one.\n\nThis very vague and indistinct **Yao-Ming**—\nit is the essential key for cultivators.\nWhen the student sits in stillness and clarity (**静定**),\nsuddenly, a fleeting awareness arises,\nat this time, the spirit-qi (**神气**) condenses in the **elixir field** (**丹田**),\npure and unified,\nand the student also does not know where it leads.\nThis is the nature and life returning to the **limitless void** (**无极**) of Heaven.\n\nThough there is this external principle (**外有是理**),\nwithin the **elixir field** (**丹田**), there must also be a harmonized **qi mechanism** (**融和气机**),\nonly then is it true evidence.\n\nFrom this single point of harmonization,\ngathered back into the **refining furnace** (**归炉**),\nsealed and nurtured with warmth,\nit will naturally emerge as the **true yang**—a single breath of **qi**.\n\nBut when the practice reaches this stage,\nthere is great peril.\nOnly by guarding with a single mind (**一心内守**),\nand illuminating the center (**了照当中**),\ncan it be unified as the **elixir medicine** (**丹药**),\nthus attaining longevity and immortality (**长生不老**).\n\nIf one harbors another thought (**生一它念**),\nthis very **original qi** (**元气**)\nwill already be mixed with the **post-heaven** (**后天**)\nand will no longer be pure.\n\nIf one indulges in a single lustful thought (**动一淫思**),\nthis **qi mechanism** will scatter outward,\nand the true essence (**真精**) will leak away.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*The matter of leaking essence (**泄精**)—\nit is not necessary to be with husband and wife,\neven a single thought’s movement,\nand the true essence will no longer be contained within the body,\nas if fleeing like running **dan**.*\n\nThe student must make the heart and **qi** unified (**心与气合**),\nand the breath and spirit intertwined (**息与神交**),\nconstantly dwelling in this **cavity** (**腔子**).\nWith time,\nendless delight (**无穷趣味**) will naturally arise.\n\nYet this is truly difficult;\nIf one can penetrate the **mysterious mechanism** (**玄机**),\nthen there will be no difficulty.\n\n「Initially, one merely employs the method of **lifting and nudging** (**提掇**), forbidding this point of true **qi** (**真气**) from dispersing downward, nor allowing this true **qi** to scatter among the six sense gates (**六根门头**). It is all about a single-hearted return to **fate** (**皈命**), and the five bodies (**五体**) offering sincere allegiance.\n\nWith time, one’s **true essence** (**真精**) will naturally be full and free from lustful thoughts (**不思色**).\nMay the student preserve and guard the **original essence** (**元精**), not allowing it to leak even a drop.\n\nAt first, it is difficult to always practice the **familiar Dao** (**熟道**).\nBut if one can endure again and again (**一忍再忍**), and not allow even a single thought to stir (**不许念头稍动**), within three months, the **external yang** (**外阳**) will naturally withdraw and be contained.\n\nWhen the **external yang** is withdrawn and contained,\nthen one will see that the **original essence** (**元气**) within the body is abundant,\nand the **immortal** (**长生不老**) and **transcendent** (**人仙**) will thus be attained—\nfor what is transcendence so distant after all?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Fully Returning to Itself**\n*\"When bent, it is whole; when twisted, it becomes straight. When hollowed, it overflows; when worn, it renews. When few, it suffices; when many, it confuses.\"*\nThus, the **sage** (**圣人**) embraces **Oneness** (**抱一**) as a model for the world.\n\nBy not seeing oneself, one becomes bright (**不自见故明**);\nBy not asserting oneself, one becomes evident (**不自是故彰**);\nBy not praising oneself, one attains merit (**不自伐故有功**);\nBy not boasting of oneself, one endures (**不自矜故长**).\n\nFor only by not contending does one ensure that none in the world can contend with them.\nWhat the ancients called *\"When bent, it is whole\"*—\nis this not true?\n\nIndeed, it is **whole** and **returns** to itself.\nThe essence of the **Great Dao** (**大道**) lies in reaching the **void** (**无**) while containing the **ultimate** (**至有**);\nReturning the **ultimate** to the **void** (**至无**), only then does one attain the **method of dual cultivation** (**性命双修**).\n\nFor **nature** (**性**) is fundamentally **void** (**无**), yet **void** arises from **ultimate** (**有**);\n**fate** (**命**) is fundamentally **ultimate** (**有**), yet **ultimate** arises from **void** (**无**).\nIf one clings to **void** (**虚无**), one falls into dull emptiness (**顽空**);\nIf one clings to **ultimate** (**实有**), one becomes ensnared by **forms and names** (**拘名象**).\nEven if one does not descend into false and unorthodox delusions (**妄诞不经**),\nit is still a one-sided practice (**一边之学**), ultimately unable to equal the **Great Dao** (**大道**).\n\nThe practitioner must first lay down all **ten thousand entanglements** (**万缘**), and not stain themselves with even a speck of **dust** (**纤尘**).\nWithin **Oneness** (**一**) and **having nothing** (**无所有**),\none must seek out a single spark of **life-force** (**生机**) to serve as the **elixir foundation** (**丹本**).\nThis is what the ancients called **true yang** (**真阳**), also known as **true lead** (**真铅**), or **true One-essence** (**真一之气**).\n\nThe **Supreme Sage** (**太上**) said: *\"When bent, it is whole\"*—\nmeaning that within the body’s hidden depths (**隐微**), the realm of **solitary knowing and solitary awareness** (**独知独觉**),\nthere exists a **complete, pristine, and fluid** (**浑沦完全、活泼流通**) **mechanism** (**机**).\nBy preserving and nurturing this,\nrefining and distilling it,\none can reach **elixir completion** (**丹成**) and **transcendence** (**仙就**).\n\nThe ancients likened it to the **slightest thread of yang** (**冬至一线微阳**) at the Winter Solstice,\nwhich brings forth **unceasing life** (**生生不已**).\nOr they likened it to the **first three days’ crescent moon** (**初三一弯新月**),\ngradually waxing full until the fifteenth day (**十五月圆**),\nall signifying the meaning of **wholeness through bending** (**由曲而全**).\n\nFor **bending** is **hidden** (**曲隐**), and in the hidden depths (**隐微**),\nthe **mechanism** (**机**) is subtle,\nyet its **fulfillment** (**成**) is grand.\nAs the *Zhongyong* says: *\"When bent, it can have\"* (**曲能有**), and this is indeed so.\n\nWithin the **bending** (**一曲**), all is the **essence of principle and qi** (**理气之元**);\nIn the **whole** (**全体**), all is the **refined essence of the Great Ultimate** (**太极之粹**).\nThus, *\"When bent, it is whole\"* (**曲则全**).\n\nThe **sage** (**圣人**) having discovered this **bending** (**曲**), diligently and cautiously guards it,\ncircling and containing it like a hen brooding her egg (**如鸡温卵**),\nor a dragon nurturing its pearl (**如龙养珠**).\nWith a single-hearted inward vigilance (**一心内守**), they do not allow it to be exposed externally (**不许外露**).\n\nIn time, it becomes vast as the tides (**浩浩如潮**),\nrising and ascending upward (**逆而上伸**).\nA single surge of **clear and rigid qi** (**清刚之气**) stands firm and ascends straight,\ntranscending the **sphere of sun and moon** (**日月之表**),\nencompassing the **boundaries of heaven and earth** (**天地之外**).\n\nThe *Kun* hexagram says:\n*\"When the earth reaches its utmost softness, it moves and becomes hard\"* (**坤至柔而动也刚**),\nall from the **residue of bending** (**致曲之余**),\nhidden and dormant in the **cauldron of earth** (**土釜**).\nIt accumulates until it overflows the heavens (**滔天**),\nbursting forth unstoppably (**勃不可遏**).\nSuch is its nature.\n\nMoreover, **twistedness** (**枉**) becomes **yin** (**阴**) and **softness** (**柔**), yet this is the same **qi** (**气**);\n**straightness** (**直**) becomes **yang** (**阳**) and **rigidity** (**刚**), yet this is also the same **qi** (**气**).\nThough it is said to transform from **twisted to straight** (**由枉而直**),\nin truth, it is **both twisted and straight** (**即枉即直**).\n\nAfter penetrating the **hidden depths** (**隐曲**) and uncovering the **root source** (**本源**),\nits **manifestation** (**见**) becomes easy,\nbut **guarding** it is difficult (**为守则难**).\nOnly by **refining it gently** (**优焉游焉**),\nnurturing its **initial traces** (**端倪**),\nand further **lowering oneself** (**卑以下人**),\nmaintaining **humility** (**谦**) in self-cultivation (**自待**),\ncan one avoid the **restless and violent** (**躁暴急迫**) nature,\nprevent **erroneous perceptions** (**邪见**), and\nnot stir **mundane fire** (**凡火**).\nOnly then can one forge the **golden elixir** (**金丹**).\n\nThus, one **controls the qi with the spirit** (**以神驭气**), and **unites the spirit with the qi** (**以气合神**),\nhidden yet manifest without trace (**隐显无端**), changing yet unmeasurable (**变化莫测**).\nThis is the *\"ultimate sincerity without pause\"* (**至诚无息**),\n*\"embodying things without omission\"* (**体物无遗**),\n*\"present in all yet not in any\"* (**无在而无不在**).\nHow can it be anything but **overflowing** (**盈**)?\n\nYet one must be **humble** (**谦**) to receive benefit,\nand **hollowed** (**洼**) to become **full** (**为盈**).\nOtherwise, how could one contain all **ultimate** (**万有**)?\n\nAs for this **slightest spark of bending** (**一曲之微**),\nit is all part of one’s **original nature** (**本来之物**).\nThis is what is meant by *\"worn\"* (**敝**),\nfor *\"worn\"* is also *\"old\"* (**敝即故**).\nAs the *Zhongyong* says: *\"To review the old and know the new\"* (**温故而知新**).\n\nIf the student wishes to obtain **news** (**新闻**) and generate **new intentions** (**新意**),\nthey must not neglect to **review the old** (**故有**) and **nurture it** (**温之**).\nOnly then can they attain the **new** (**新**).\nThis is also *\"worn yet renewed\"* (**敝即新**).\n\nThough *\"worn\"* is little (**敝亦无几**),\nif one nurtures it in its **fewness** (**少而养之**),\nthe **vast and harmonious qi** (**浩然之气**) can fill heaven and earth,\nand pierce the **Big Dipper** (**贯斗牛**).\n\nIf one claims the **Dao** is vast and all-encompassing (**浩潮弥纶**),\nthat it is **present in all yet not in any** (**无在不是**),\nand takes its **many** (**多**) aspects to practice,\nI fear **principle and desire** (**理欲**) will become **entangled** (**杂乘**),\nand **good and evil** (**善恶**) will be **indistinguishable** (**莫辨**).\nSometimes guarding the **middle** (**守中**), sometimes collecting **medicinal herbs** (**采药**),\nsometimes advancing **fire** (**进火**) and retreating **symbols** (**退符**),\nclinging to **forms** (**着象**) and grasping **names** (**执名**),\nthe more one does, the better (**多多益善**),\nyet it remains a **rootless practice** (**无本之学**),\nhaving not attained **cessation and return** (**止归**),\nand is ultimately a **tangle of confusion** (**一个迷团**).\nNo wonder one remains **lifelong in doubt, never enlightened** (**毕生怀疑莫悟**).\n\nThe **sage** (**圣人**) embraces **Oneness** (**抱一**) for self-cultivation (**自修**),\nand also applies it to the world (**施之天下**),\nas a **model for all** (**天下楷模**).\nIf one does not know that the **method of bending** (**一曲之道**) is truly the **unifying method** (**一贯之道**),\nand occasionally strays from it—\n**occasional straying** (**偶离**) means **no model** (**无式**),\n**no model** means **no attainment** (**无成**),\nand the **Dao** is thus **unreliable** (**何赖焉**).\n\nFor the **Dao** is fundamentally **one principle of heaven and humanity** (**天人一理**),\n**all things share the same source** (**物我同源**),\nand is **common to all** (**公共之物**).\nYet today’s students each **cling stubbornly to their own views** (**固执己见**),\nclaiming none can surpass them (**谓人莫己若**).\nEven this **boastful thought** (**矜骄之念**) has already obscured their **innate clarity** (**灵明**),\nand they do not understand to **measure the ancient and apply it to the present** (**酌古准今**),\nnor to **take the law from its highest source** (**取法乎上**).\n\nThe *Zhongyong* says:\n*\"The **Dao of the gentleman** is **darkly luminous** (**暗然**) and naturally stands forth\"* (**自章**),\n*\"The **Dao of the petty person** is **brightly evident** (**的然**) and naturally perishes\"* (**自亡**).\n\n「The **Dao** of the true cultivator is indeed something to be held with solemn reverence. Even if one approaches the brink of divine transformation, it is merely what one ought to achieve by duty and nature—why must one display it to the world and boast of one’s accomplishments? If one praises oneself, not only will others despise it, but the merit itself will be false and not genuine. The ancients, after achieving their goals, withdrew humbly, never claiming credit for their deeds; it is fitting that their merit should cover the world and serve as a model for all ages.\n\nAs for self-cultivation and self-discipline, it is like clothing that brings warmth or food that satisfies hunger—each person attains their own comfort and joy, and what others possess is sufficient for them. Why should one be arrogant and self-conceited, boasting of one’s strengths? Though it is said that wisdom grows daily and insight expands each day, this is merely a common trait of human nature—only that I have attained it earlier. Where is the true merit in that?\n\nIf one boasts of their strengths, then those strengths will become weaknesses. Even the most foolish person would not willingly fall behind—how many disputes do not originate from this? The gentleman has no need to contend, so the world cannot contend with his ability. The ancient saying, *\"Bend and you will remain whole\"* (**曲则全**), is indeed not empty words—does it not mean that one must fully receive and fully return to attain the **Dao**? This is the **Zhongyong**’s **Dao**, and the next level is the **Dao** of bending (**致曲**), which is hidden yet profound (**隐曲**).\n\nThe **Dao** is called *\"**Xuanqiao**\"* (**玄窍**), the Buddha calls it *\"**Nagaraja**\"* (**那个**), and the Confucian calls it *\"**duanni**\"* (**端倪**). Though it is not void nor empty, it is the origin from which heaven and earth opened, and all beings emerged. At every moment, its movement and stillness are visible.\n\nWhen it is still and gives rise, it does not come from external stimulation—\nsuddenly one becomes aware, and this awareness itself is bending (**曲**).\nWhen it moves and manifests, it arises from spontaneous resonance—\nsuddenly it stirs, and this stirring itself is bending (**曲**).\nEssentially, all comes from a time of ignorance and unawareness,\nwhen the **qi**’s momentum moves on its own.\nIt moves and suddenly one is aware—this is true movement, true awareness.\nBut its momentum is extremely subtle, fleeting in an instant;\na mere shift of thought or breath is already **postnatal** (**后天**),\nand cannot serve as the root of life for beings,\nnor as the foundation for refining the elixir (**炼丹**).\n\nWe receive **qi** and take form as beings and things—\nall from this single moment of differentiation.\nThe right and wrong, true and false of **Dao** cultivation—\nwhich does not originate from this single moment?\n*The Zhou Shu* says:\n*\"**Wàngniàn** (**罔念**) leads to madness, **kèniàn** (**克念**) leads to sainthood.\"*\nThe difference between sainthood and madness is decided by this single moment—\nso swift, this is what is meant by bending (**一曲**).\n\nThe ancients likened it to lightning and the flash of a stone,\nor to riding a thousand-li horse that leaves the dust behind and gallops on.\nAt this moment, one must have the **Buddha’s wisdom eye** (**智珠**) brightly illuminating\nto recognize it clearly.\nOnce this **origin** (**端倪**) is known,\none must still nourish and expand it—\nas Mencius said: *\"Fire begins with a spark, water with a trickle,\nyet they grow vast and fill the heavens and earth.\"*\n\nBut how does one expand?\nIt is not by forcing oneself to submit—\nonly then can **true qi** (**正气**) stretch naturally.\nIt is not by lowering oneself artificially—\nonly then can **heavenly virtue** (**天德**) remain whole.\nOne must only guard the **Dao**’s original state within things,\nunmixed and undivided,\nwarm in its stillness,\nembracing **oneness** (**一**),\nnot seeking novelty in new ends,\nnor indulging in the complexity of names and forms (**名象**).\nThus, one will not fall deeper into confusion with each passing day,\nbut instead find joy in the **Dao**’s ceaseless renewal (**日新又新**).\n\nThe ancient sages knew that bending (**一曲**) is the stage for attaining immortality and sainthood,\nso they embraced **qi** with the **Dao**,\nlet the **Dao** depend on **qi**,\nand united **Dao** and **qi** without separation,\nas the essential method for self-cultivation,\nand as the model for all under heaven.\nIf one insists on their own views,\nthen they obscure their own clarity and fail to shine.\nWhat’s more, self-praise leads to labor without merit,\nand self-conceit leads to shortcoming rather than growth.\n\nWisdom arises from emotion (**智起情生**),\noften becoming the **Dao**’s greatest harm.\nOnly by not insisting on one’s own views,\nnot praising oneself nor boasting of one’s strengths,\ncan one’s mind remain tranquil and **qi** harmonious—\nthen naturally, there will be no evil outside,\nno exhaustion within,\nand who will contend with them?\n\nThe **Dao**’s subtle and silent transformation is thus:\nunless one embraces **oneness** (**抱一**) and fully receives and returns,\nhow can one return to the **Taishang**’s (**太始**) original beginning?\n\n**Chapter 23: Rare Speech and Naturalness**\nRare speech and naturalness (**希言自然**).\nHence, gusts of wind do not last all morning,\nsudden rains do not persist all day.\nWho is responsible for this?\nHeaven and earth.\nEven heaven and earth cannot endure long—\nhow much less so humanity?\nThus, those who practice the **Dao**:\nthose aligned with the **Dao** are in harmony with the **Dao**,\nthose aligned with **virtue** (**德**) are in harmony with **virtue**,\nthose aligned with loss are in harmony with loss.\nThose in harmony with the **Dao** find the **Dao** rejoices in their attainment;\nthose in harmony with **virtue** find **virtue** rejoices in their attainment;\nthose in harmony with loss find loss rejoices in their attainment—\ntruly, there is no doubt,\nthere is no disbelief.\n\nThe **Dao** is fundamentally without sound or breath (**无声无息**),\nso it is called *\"**rare speech**\"* (**希言**).\nThe **Dao** is fundamentally without action or contrivance (**无为无作**),\nso it is called *\"**naturalness**\"* (**自然**).\n\nWhat can endure, what can last—\nit is nothing but following heaven’s movement and acting in accordance with one’s nature,\nlistening solely to the **qi**’s momentum as it unfolds.\nIf one forces or fabricates, unable to follow the **qi**’s momentum,\nand fails to align with the **Heaven-Earth**’s (**乾坤**) revolving cycles,\nthe rising and setting of the sun and moon,\nthen it will be like fleeting winds of boiling soup,\nviolent torrents of rain—\nuprooting great trees, surging across flat plains,\ncoming swiftly, departing swiftly—\nhow could their force endure all day or all morning?\n\nYet who is responsible for this?\nAsk heaven and earth, and they will not know.\nFor heaven and earth are the sovereign rulers of all things—\nif they do not follow their own constant ways,\nthey still cannot endure long.\nHow much less so humanity, which exists within heaven and earth,\nlike a single grain in the **Taicang** (**太仓**)?\nIf one does not practice the **Dao**’s enduring way,\nhow can they hope to last?\n\nThus, the **Taishang** (**太上**) teaches that the **Dao**’s source\nis **wuwei** (**无为**) as its essence,\nand naturalness (**自然**) as its function.\nIf one does not attend to this,\nbut instead boasts of shortcuts,\nor seeks out marvelous tricks,\none is mistaken!\n\nObserve those who study the **Dao**—\nthough they may dwell in distant east, west, south, or north,\nand their teachings vary in sound,\nyet if they have a resolve for the **Dao**,\nand do not stray into false paths,\nthey will all converge in perfect accord without division.»\n\nTo walk the Dao and gain insight within—this is called **virtue**.\nOnce one knows how to cultivate the Dao,\n**virtue** naturally arises within them.\nAll who clearly manifest their **virtue**,\nfree from distraction and confusion,\nfind themselves in silent accord as one.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Those who align with the Dao are one with the Dao,\nthose who align with **virtue** are one with **virtue**—\nwhat strange wonder is there in this?\"*\n\nAt the outset of practice,\ncultivation follows the Dao and **virtue**,\nadheres to principles and rules,\neffortless yet unburdened, free from entanglement.\nWhen one reaches the stage of profound self-realization,\nsettled in ease and deepened in insight,\nresources flow effortlessly in all directions—\nwhat was once gained now seems suddenly lost.\nWith pure dedication, all merges into one,\nas though crafting a wheel behind closed doors,\nyet when it rolls, the rims align perfectly—\nall is unified.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Those who lose are one with loss.\"*\n\nThese three stages differ in their effort,\neach advancing along distinct paths.\nYet when the labor endures long,\nand suffering fades into tranquility,\na boundless serenity emerges,\nrich with delight—\nspontaneously expressing the natural workings of heaven.\nSuffering is exhausted—\nwhere then does joy find its limit?\nThus it is said:\n*\"Those who align with the Dao find the Dao rejoices in them;\nthose who align with **virtue** find **virtue** rejoices in them;\nthose who align with loss find loss rejoices in them.\"*\n\nClearly, the essence of **wuwei** is what all cultivate together,\nand the art of naturalness is what all employ in common.\nEven sages spanning ten thousand *li*,\nor divine beings across ten thousand years—\nthough time and place may shift,\nthey naturally harmonize as though seals fit perfectly,\nall converging toward the same path.\n\nIf one claims that naturalness is not always thus,\nthen delusion obstructs within,\nand strange methods arise.\nSome cling rigidly to the concrete, stubbornly fixed,\nothers cling to emptiness, practicing solitary stillness.\nSuch cases are countless—\nall stem from failing to trust the principle of **wuwei**,\nthe Dao of naturalness,\nand instead clinging to their own views as truth.\n\nNo wonder those who begin young in the Dao\nfind no fruition in their later years—\ntheir resolve exceeds their learning,\nyet they never grasp the true meaning,\nstraying into false paths.\nHow tragic!\nHow lamentable!\n\nThis speaks of the **Dao of wuwei** and naturalness—\nthe same that governs heaven and earth, sun and moon,\nthe unseen and the spirits of the dead and living.\nAll follow this principle:\n**wuwei** and naturalness,\nwhere birth is fulfillment,\nand action is spontaneous use.\n\nYet ordinary people, once born,\nexhaust their cleverness day and night—\nhow much of their innate **Dao** remains?\nOnly those of lofty **Dao** follow nature’s constant way.\n\nThough their early efforts may seem forced,\nonce perfected, they return to the realm of **wuwei** and naturalness,\nas if effortless—\nwithout striving, yet hitting the mark,\nmoving freely along the **Dao**.\n\nThus, the sage observing the Great **Dao** sees\nthe principle of **wuwei** and naturalness\nclearly before their eyes—\nno need for agreement, yet all align.\nBut common folk, gazing at the Great **Dao**,\nbelieve only sages and immortals dare speak of it;\nordinary people dare not.\n\nThe *Zhongyong* says:\n*\"Strive in learning, struggle in difficulty—\nsuccess brings unity.\"*\nIs this mere deceit?\nNo.\n\n---\n\nYet the root of this lies in the initial unbelief in the **Dao** of *wuwei* and naturalness,\nentering through the gate of *budaode* (not the Way).\nThe further one strays, the deeper the separation—\nthus, the **Dao** of *wuwei* and naturalness cannot be fully embraced,\nand distinctions arise like divided households.\n\nOnly those who grasp this principle\nwill not be misled by false paths and heterodox teachings.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Perils of Self-Imposed Extremes**\nHe who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm,\nhe who strides cannot walk steadily.\nHe who insists on his own view sees nothing clearly,\nhe who clings to his own righteousness cannot shine forth.\nHe who boasts of his own merits gains no true success,\nhe who vaunts his own virtues cannot endure.\n\nIn the **Dao**, such actions are called\nsuperfluous food and burdensome exertion.\nMen may detest them, hence the **Dao**-bearer does not indulge.\n\nEarlier, it was said that the **Dao** is spoken of rarely and naturally,\nnot like the world’s coarse and dull masses,\nwho mistake idleness for *wuwei* and reckless abandon for naturalness.\n\nTruly, this is the **Dao** of Great Balance and Rectitude,\nconforming to Heaven’s principle and human nature,\nfollowing the sage’s path and the kingly **Way**,\npreserving and reflecting upon the origin,\nreturning to the source—\nthus, in harmony with Heaven’s command,\nthere is *wuwei* yet nothing remains undone,\nnaturalness yet nothing unnatural.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"To exhaust principle and fulfill nature, reaching even to fate\"*—\nthis must be the man of **Dao**!\n\nExcess is fault, deficiency is also fault.\nThe *Shujing* states: *\"Without partiality or cliques, the kingly **Way** flows vast and unrestricted\"*—\nthis is indeed the case.\n\nEven as a man stands upright,\nthere is an original constancy that does not alter.\nThe *tiptoeing* (跂) is when both feet are raised in support.\nThe *Shijing* says: *\"On tiptoe, I await him\"*—\nwith this stance, one may gaze far and wide,\nbut if it is meant to endure, how can it last?\n\nThe *striding* (跨) is when both feet are spread apart.\nWith this, one may ride astride a horse and rest upon the saddle,\nbut if it is meant for walking, how can it proceed?\nThe enlightened do not cling to their own views—\nclinging to one’s own view, clarity is lost.\nThe illustrious do not insist on their own sight—\ninsisting on one’s own sight, brilliance is obscured.\n\nOften, those who boast of their own merits reap no true success,\nfor success that is genuine cannot be concealed by others—\nwhy boast at all?\nOften, those who vaunt their own virtues cannot last,\nfor virtues that endure command natural reverence—\nwhy need to vaunt?\n\nIf one does not believe in the **Dao** of *wuwei* and naturalness,\nand does not know how *\"without doing, yet all things are done\"* (莫之为而为),\n*\"without striving, yet all things are achieved\"* (莫之致而致),\nthen all actions are left to Heaven—\nhow effortless!\n\nTo move yet cannot help but move,\nto stop yet cannot help but stop—\nmovement and stillness blend in effortless spontaneity,\nhow tranquil!\n\nIf one fails to grasp the void yet without trace (虚而无朕),\nit is like being vast yet unable to contain—\nor if one adds an extra thought,\nor forces an additional perspective,\nlike gluttony’s excess or labor’s overstrain—\nnot only is it unprofitable, but it harms.\n\nThe scholar must align with the *wuwei* of Heaven’s **virtue**,\nfollow the *ziran* (自然) of things’ inherent principle—\nnot only should one not impose human contrivances upon it,\nbut even things themselves should be allowed their ease.\n\nRegulate one’s diet and rest—\nif even slightly mismatched, exceeding the natural measure,\nwhether through overindulgence or excessive asceticism—\nlike a dog’s overstuffed belly bringing injury,\nor a cow’s overworked body bringing exhaustion—\nthis is to invite inner unrest and self-detestation.\n\nHence it is said: *\"Men may detest them.\"*\n\nThose who twist and strain, seeking to stand or walk,\nto shine or be illustrious,\nto achieve merits that move others,\nor virtues that surpass the crowd—\nsuch endeavors are indeed difficult!\n\nThe **Dao**-bearing gentleman despises them utterly,\ndeeming them unworthy of his own company.\n\nThis rare mention of naturalness\nis but one principle: **cleanness** (清净).\n\nWhat is **cleanness** (清)?\nWhen not a single thought arises.\n\nWhat is **purity** (净)?\nWhen not a speck of dust defiles the mind.\n\nThe goal is for this heart\nto be like a mirror without dust,\nor still water without ripples—\na single luminous, empty spirit,\nand **cleanness** is attained.\n\nIf the world’s common folk,\ndull and muddled, spend the day doing nothing,\nthis is not **cleanness**.\n\nOnly when **cleanness** holds light,\nand **purity** reflects brilliance,\nlike a moonlit pool’s unobstructed radiance—\nthen does one truly grasp **cleanness**.\n\nYet if even a trace of self-display or self-righteousness remains,\nit becomes an obstruction.\n\nThus, the seeker of the **Dao** must cultivate a boundless heart,\nletting no thing or thought disturb his mind or occupy his spirit.\nThrough prolonged nurturing, a single luminous spark\nilluminates all—\nlike the sun and moon in the sky,\npenetrating every corner.\n\nOnly fear arises when\none thought of clarity is followed by another of indulgence—\nthen clarity is no longer constant.\n\nMencius’ strength lay in *yangqi* (养气),\nfor when *qi* is undisturbed, the spirit is naturally luminous,\nand when the spirit is luminous, the heart is naturally at ease—\nthus he spoke not of nurturing the heart but of nurturing the *qi*,\ntruly knowing that when the will is unified, it moves the *qi*,\nand when the *qi* is unified, it moves the will.\n\nIf one merely claims to nurture the heart\nwithout seeking to nurture the *qi*,\nmany will never find peace in their hearts their whole lives.\n\nWhen the heart is truly **cleanness** (清净),\nthe true *yang* (真阳) naturally arises.\nAll ascensions and descents, movements and transformations,\nmust follow their natural course.\n\nTo force the *tiptoeing* (跂) to stand,\nor the *striding* (跨) to walk—\nexcessive food or burdensome exertion—\nthese are all misalignments.\nThings already detest them—\nhow much more so will men?\n\nHence, the **Dao**-bearing gentleman\ncannot bear to indulge in such things.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Fifth: The **Dao** Follows Naturalness**\nThere exists a primordial unity (有物混成),\nborn before Heaven and Earth,\nsilent and vast (寂兮寥兮),\nself-sufficient yet unchanging (独立而不改),\ncirculating without exhaustion (周行而不殆),\ncapable of being the Mother of all under Heaven.\n\nI do not know its name—\nI call it **Dao** (道),\nand forcefully name it *Great* (大).\n*Great* means *passing* (逝),\n*passing* means *distant* (远),\n*distant* means *returning* (反).\n\nThus, the **Dao** is *Great*,\nHeaven is *Great*,\nEarth is *Great*,\nand the king is also *Great*.\nWithin the realm, there are four *Great* ones,\nand the king stands among them.\n\nThe king follows Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the **Dao**,\nand the **Dao** follows naturalness (*ziran*).\n\nWhat is the **Dao**?\nIt is the undifferentiated state before *Hongmeng* (鸿蒙) split,\nwhen Heaven and Earth had not yet taken form,\nwhen man and things were yet unshaped—\na boundless, chaotic *qi* (混混沌沌),\n\nBoundless and boundless, measureless and endless,\nas if there were a thing formed from the chaos,\nswirling in reality, born before Heaven and Earth—\nthis is what is called the **Wuji** (無極).\n\nSilent and void yet teeming with vitality,\nvast yet containing motion—\nthis is what is called the **Taiji** (太極).\n\nAll things have duality,\nyet the **Taiji** is undivided.\n\nFrom its single movement,\nHeaven and Earth were opened,\nYin and Yang divided,\nthe Four Symbols and Five Phases contained within.\nHumans and things proliferate,\nthe sun and moon wax and wane—\nhow could it not be that the more they generate,\nthe more the **Taiji** seems to diminish?\n\nYet this chaotic, primordial substance—\ninvisible to sight, inaudible to hearing,\nyet present in all things, at all times—\nsolitary yet complete,\nwholly unified yet ever-generating,\nendlessly transforming—\nfrom chaos to the present,\nunchanging in its constant measure,\nflowing as one *qi* within independence,\ncirculating through the Dharma-realm,\nopening and closing effortlessly,\ncycling endlessly.\n\nIf one speaks of ordinary things,\nit seems as though it might be exhausted!\nYet it flows through the Three Realms,\nfills all beings,\nHeaven relies on it for clarity,\nEarth on stability,\nvalleys on fullness,\nhumans on life—\nall following its natural course.\n\nWithin it, things generate themselves,\ncomplete themselves,\nwhile the **Taiji** remains wholly intact,\nyet never diminished.\n\nThough myriad transformations arise endlessly,\nall emerge from it—\nthus it can be the Mother of all under Heaven.\n\nHeaven is most exalted,\nand thus may be named;\nEarth is most profound,\nand thus may be named.\nYet this **Wuji**—the ultimate of the ultimate—\nneither divine nor formless,\nsilent yet ceaseless—\nI know not its name,\nand thus call it **Dao**.\n\nThe **Dao** is the shared path of Heaven, Earth, and all beings,\nthe common origin.\nThe **Dao** encompasses Heaven and Earth,\nyet Heaven and Earth cannot encompass the **Dao**.\nThe **Dao** nurtures all beings,\nyet all beings cannot nurture the **Dao**.\nIts vastness is unfathomable—\nI forcefully name it *Great*.\n\nOh, the **Dao** is *Great*!\nHow it moves forward endlessly,\nwith nothing to halt it!\nBeyond *Great* is *Passing*—\nhow it transcends all boundaries,\nfills the absolute void,\nendlessly distant and immeasurable!\nBeyond *Passing* is *Distant*—\nfor all things, when extremes meet,\nthey return—\nhow it turns and flows,\ncycling without end!\nThus it is also named *Returning*.\n\nSuch names, though varied,\ncan only slightly describe its grandeur.\nYet what is greater than the **Dao**?\nBeyond the **Dao**, only Heaven is *Great*.\nBeyond Heaven, only Earth is *Great*.\nAbove Earth, only the king is *Great*.\nThus, within the four directions,\nthere are four *Great* ones,\nand the king stands among them.\n\nThe king is the first among all things,\ngoverning rivers and mountains,\nruling over humans and things,\nworthy to be named *Great* alongside Heaven and Earth.\nYet the king is borne by Earth,\nso he follows Earth in governance.\nEarth is covered by Heaven,\nso Earth follows Heaven in decree.\nAnd Heaven is nurtured by the **Dao**,\nso Heaven follows the **Dao** in administration.\nAll ultimately stem from naturalness,\nrequiring no coercion or arrangement.\nIs the **Dao** then something separate?\nI forcefully name it *the **Dao** follows naturalness*.\n\nThe scholar who cultivates both nature (*xing*) and life (*ming*)\nmust take the *li* (principles) and *qi* of Heaven and Earth as substance,\nand their functions as practice.\nThus, cultivating nature exhausts nature,\nrefining life establishes life—\nhow could mere talk of *naturalness* compare?\n\nHeaven and Earth are vast and boundless,\nencompassing both the most apparent and subtle,\nthe most empty and solid.\nYet all forms and colors arise from within—\nwhat is this thing?\n\nBorn before Heaven and Earth,\ngoverning within them,\nestablished in purity yet unchanging,\ncirculating through the sands of existence without exhaustion—\ntruly the Mother of all under Heaven.\n\nBefore the opening of creation,\nthis maternal *qi* existed,\nand only then did Heaven and Earth arise.\nAfter the opening of creation,\nthis maternal *qi* sustained,\nand only then did humans and things emerge.\nI know not its name—\nI forcefully call it **Dao**, call it *Great*.\n*Great* encompasses all,\n*Passing* reaches everywhere,\nand nothing is too *Distant* to attain.\n\nKnow that extremes must return—\nthe **Dao**’s grandeur is not merely among the four *Great* ones!\n\nThe student of the **Dao** must not speak idly of *naturalness*,\nbut must instead focus the mind and regulate the breath—\nfocusing the mind so it does not scatter,\naligning the human heart with the heart of Heaven and Earth;\nregulating the breath so it does not falter,\nharmonizing human *qi* with the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAssisting the cosmos,\nweaving through Heaven and Earth—\nwhat greater function is there?\nIt lies within one’s mind and body,\na breath’s span away.\n\nAs the *Zhongyong* says:\n*“Attain harmony, and Heaven and Earth take their positions,\nand all things are nurtured.”*\nIs this not what it means?\n\nIf one constantly nurtures the mind,\nmoment by moment cultivates *qi*,\nand beyond mere sustenance and rest,\nremains ever-aware—\nallowing no stray thought, no broken breath—\nonly then is illness averted.\nOtherwise, even a moment’s neglect invites external evils to disturb.\nWhen right *qi* is lost,\nevil *qi* easily enters—\nthis is inevitable.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*“If one’s thoughts never arise,\ndesires never form,\nHeaven and Earth cannot fathom their secrets,\nghosts and spirits cannot discern their workings.”*\nThis is no falsehood.\n\nSome say one must first establish the foundation (*zhujī*) to attain longevity.\nYet the student of the **Dao** needs no such foundation—\nonly that mind and *qi* remain constantly knit as one,\nnever scattered,\nand then ghosts and spirits cannot seize the soul or spirit.\nMy life is mine alone—\nnot by Heaven’s decree.\n\nThe Master says:\n*\"I do not fear the blame of divulging this—\nshould later scholars fail to uphold these teachings,\nthey will have no way to answer me.*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as the Light’s Root, the Still as the Restless’ Lord**\nThe heavy is the root of the light,\nthe still is the sovereign of the restless.\nThus the Sage, throughout the day,\nwalks without abandoning the burdened cart—\nthough there be splendid sights,\nhe rests as one detached.\n\nAlas, how can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nhold his body so lightly to the world?\nLightness brings loss of *qi*,\nrestlessness brings loss of spirit.\nThe path of cultivation\nconcerns but two things: spirit and *qi*.\nTo refine and nourish them,\nto return them to the Original Beginning’s Heaven—\nthis is all.\n\nIn the **pre-heaven** stage,\n*qi* is undifferentiated, formless,\never dense and settled;\nspirit dwells in the shapeless,\never subtle and ineffable.\nOnce entering the **post-heaven** stage,\nthe heavy *qi* becomes light and ascends,\nthe still spirit becomes restless and moves.\nThe *qi* is not as lively as in pre-heaven,\never damp and murky, failing to purify;\nthe spirit is not as luminous as in pre-heaven,\nsevered from its root, yet alone it shines.\nThis is why life fails to take hold,\nand nature becomes hard to refine.\n\nScholars who seek longevity\nmust know that *qi* must return to its root.\nHow can the root be restored?\nThe light and scattered *qi* must be\nreclaimed to the realm of depth and solidity,\nsteadfast and unyielding,\ncongealed into one mass—\nthen *qi* returns to life,\nand its vastness fills the Heaven.\nThe restless and deluded spirit must be\nreclaimed to the land of clarity,\never lucid and serene,\nfree and at ease—\nthen spirit returns to nature,\nand its unity knows no bounds.\n\nThus, when spirit returns to its original nature,\nand *qi* returns to its original life,\nit is as though Heaven and Earth\nhad not yet begun to manifest—\nundivided, boundless,\nvast and endless.\nThe more it congeals and solidifies,\nthe swifter its movement;\nthe more it is empty and without trace,\nthe more boundless its function.\n\nBy this,\nthe *qi* grows ever heavy yet ever light—\nthis is the **Hao** and **Ran** *qi*,\nmost great, most resolute,\nfilling Heaven and Earth;\nthe spirit, able to be still yet also active—\nas the *Yijing* says:\n*\"Wondrously transforming all things, it is the spirit.\"*\nZǐsī’s words: *\"Supreme sincerity is like the spirit\"*—\nthis is correct.\n\nThus the Sage, in his adherence to the **Dao**,\nwalks throughout the day without straying from the burdened cart,\nlest his light *qi* weigh down the heavy,\nand hinder the movement’s mechanism.\nSuch steadfast self-mastery—\ndoes it not quicken his progress?\nEven if there be the beauty of sounds and colors,\nthe allure of wealth and profit,\nthese are the splendid sights of the common folk,\nnot the concerns of the virtuous.\n\nWhen such things appear before his eyes,\nthe virtuous man remains as one in seclusion,\ndetached from all things,\nas though they do not exist.\nAlas, how can he who holds the rule of ten thousand chariots,\nthe highest honor and rank,\na body capable of becoming an immortal or Buddha,\nfail to cherish himself,\nyet cling to worldly pleasures,\nthe joys of mortal life, as his fate?\nIs this not to hold his body lightly,\nand view himself as too small?\n\nLightness brings loss of *qi*—\n*qi* lost, the form of the subject is lost;\nrestlessness brings loss of spirit—\nspirit lost, the form of the sovereign is lost.\nWhen both spirit and *qi* are lost,\nand one claims the body can still endure—\nhow few there are!\n\nThis is truly to not know\nthat the human body is hard to obtain,\nthe Central Lands hard to be born in,\nyet to hold oneself lightly—\nis this not a great lament?\n\nSome cling to the dusty world’s splendor,\ncovet the path of officialdom,\nsaying that those who benefit themselves are many,\nand those who enrich their families are great.\nYet they do not see that\nthe fields of wealth and nobility\nare also the lands of sword and war!\nFrom ages past,\nthe elephant perished by its tusks,\nthe jade brought ruin by its embrace—\ntheir harm can be counted!\n\nHow is it that men\nonly see the small and fail to follow the great?\nAh! This grievous indeed!\"\n\nThe water is light and floats—\nthis is the *post-heaven qi*, an external elixir.\nGold is heavy and sinks—\nthis is the *pre-heaven essence*, called true lead—\nalso called *golden elixir*, also called the *White Tiger’s crescent qi*.\nIts names vary, yet it is the internal elixir.\n\nPre-heaven gold generates water,\nthe natural order of creation,\ngiving life to man—\nthus, *heavy is the root of light*.\n\nMan born of *post-heaven* is but\na raging, light, and floating *qi* in action—\nthus water’s *qi* is light and floats,\npassions and desires multiply,\nthe treasure of life is lost—\nhence, aging and decay come easily.\n\nThe sage has the method of *inverse cultivation*,\nnothing but water giving birth to gold again,\nlight returning to heavy,\nto restore the unity of *pre-heaven qi*.\n\nThus, throughout the day he walks,\nnever straying from his burden—\nneither swaying nor tipping,\nsteadfast and upright,\nnurturing vast *qi* to fill heaven and earth.\n\nThis is the Dao of *inverse cultivation* for the immortal,\nforged through elixir refinement.\nIn sum, it is the transformation\nfrom form to formlessness—\none matter of the elixir path.\n\nFire is dry and active—\nthe *post-heaven spirit*, an external elixir.\nWood is still and congealed—\nthe *pre-heaven essence*, called true mercury,\ntrue essence, also called *Green Dragon*, *True One qi*.\nIts names are many, yet all are internal elixirs.\n\nPre-heaven wood generates fire,\nthe natural order of creation,\ngiving life to man—\nthus, *stillness is the sovereign of agitation*.\n\nOnce man takes form,\npurely the restless, deceitful spirit of confused thought prevails—\nthus fire’s nature is wild and erratic,\nfraud and trickery abound,\ntrue essence is bound and lost—\nhence, weakness and collapse come easily.\n\nThe sage has the method of *inverted application*,\nnothing but fire giving birth to wood again,\nagitation returning to stillness,\nto restore the unity of the dual spirit.\n\nThough there may be splendor and ease,\nall phenomena are empty,\none true essence is held—\nnurturing the Great Awakening Golden Immortal,\nsummoning the celestial heights.\n\nThis is the elixir path of *inverted refinement*,\nby which immortality is achieved.\nIn essence, it is the return\nfrom awareness to non-awareness—\nanother branch of cultivation.\n\nThis is the refinement of external elixirs\nto cultivate internal elixirs,\nreturning from *post-heaven* to *pre-heaven*.\n\nLet me speak plainly:\nThe Dao of birth follows the natural order,\nthe Dao of immortality inverts and overcomes—\nfor if it does not overcome, it does not give life,\nnor can it achieve completion.\nThus, the *River Diagram* and *Luo Book* employ both generation and overcoming.\n\nNow, the cultivation of Confucian and Buddhist scholars\ndiffers from my Dao—\nthey follow the natural order,\nconforming to the measure of spontaneity.\nMy Dao alone inverts and refines,\nrequiring strenuous effort and deliberate action.\nIf one fails to overcome,\nthere can be no birth or completion.\n\nYet cultivation in accordance with nature is easy,\nwhile inverted cultivation is difficult.\nWithout a true master,\nwithout the correct method,\nreckless gathering and reckless refinement\nrarely fail to bring harm.\nOnce a true master is obtained,\nonce the correct method is known—\nif one does not seize the immortal opportunity,\nif one does not perform virtuous deeds,\nthen the spirits of heaven will not aid,\ndemons will entangle,\nand one will surely fail at the brink of success—\nelixir overturned, cauldron shattered,\nlife and body both lost.\nThis is truly something to be cautious of!\n\nHow does one invert and overcome?\nAt first, one follows the natural order,\nimitating the method of husband and wife,\nwith fire entering the water’s domain—\nthis is the spirit entering the *qi*—\nthis is the common father and mother producing the elixir.\n\nWhen fire steams and water boils,\ngold is born from the water’s depths.\nAt this time, the mystic orifice opens,\ntrue faith arrives—\ntrue yang is born, and the child elixir is produced—\nthis is the external elixir.\n\nOnce the gold *qi* is born,\ntrue lead is sufficient.\nWith fire hastening and water surging,\nwood bearing gold upward,\nurging it step by step,\ngently guiding it,\nascending to the *Kan* cauldron,\npairing true lead with true mercury,\nusing true fire and true intent to draw it down\ninto the elixir field,\nentering the *Kun* womb—\nwith furnace and cauldron harmonizing the elixir substances,\nthis is the reversal of *Kan* as male,\nthe restoration of *Li* as female.\n\nReversing male and female,\nselecting host and guest,\nreturning them to the furnace,\nboiling and refining for a time,\nthen awaiting the movement of true yang fire,\nto make the great elixir of gold and fire.\n\nThis is the birth of the internal elixir,\nalso called the birth of the great elixir.\nThis is the sacred father and holy mother\nconjoining to bear it.\n\nAs for the earlier minor elixir’s birth,\nits movement lies outside the kidney passage,\nits *qi* is small—\nthus it is called the *minor elixir*, the *external elixir*.\nThis, however, moves within the *qi* roots—\nwhen born, there are celestial omens of stars,\nearthly signs of tides,\nand tremors in the six senses—\nthus it is called the *internal elixir*, the *great elixir*,\nalso called *golden elixir*.\n\nAgain, with this golden elixir,\none stirs the *River Vehicle*,\nagitates the *Xun* wind,\napplies the *Kun* fire,\nand refines the true essence of the *Li* palace.\nTrue *qi* merges with true essence,\nusing *pre-heaven* yang *qi*\nto subdue *post-heaven* yin essence—\nthe yin essence also merges with true *qi*\nand transforms into the sacred embryo.\n\nTrue *qi* is born from true essence—\nthis is the child *qi*—\n*qi* returns to essence,\nthus likened to the child entering the mother’s womb.\nThe child clings to the mother and comes,\nthe mother clings to the child and remains.\nChild and mother embrace,\nspirit and *qi* depend on each other.\n\nWithin, the true fire burns;\nwithout, the *yin* and *yang* fires are applied—\ninternal and external refinement together\nform the sacred embryo.\nAs it is said:\n*\"When lead is nearly spent and mercury dries,\nit transforms into a single mass of purple gold.\"*\n\nThe great elixir path differs from the path of birth\nonly in its inversion of creation,\nits reversal of heaven and earth.\n\nAll those with virtue, with fate, with the Dao,\nwho encounter this exposition,\nmay apply themselves without fear of heterodox calamity.\n\nYet the celestial secrets are fully revealed here.\nIf there are those who aid in virtue,\nwho receive celestial inspiration,\nwho understand this meaning—\nthey must not lightly divulge it,\nlest they incur guilt.\n\n「As for the scripture’s mention of *\"the sovereign of ten thousand chariots\"* (萬乘之主), it refers to the **original spirit** (元神) within the human body.\n\nIndeed, no one’s heart does not wish for their own body to be at peace and their hundred years of life to be strong and unbroken. Yet how can one know the **Dao’s enticement** (誘物化) and the rise of emotions, while still recklessly expending their body for the sake of the world? This is **qi** (氣) that is hollow and dissipated, losing its essence; this is the **spirit** (神) that is restless and ungrounded, losing its clarity. Even if the body remains, its vitality is scarce indeed—how much more so for the **great elixir Dao** (金丹大道)?\n\nThis exposition has now meticulously clarified the principles of **foundation-building** (築基), **self-refinement** (煉己), **forming the elixir** (結丹), **returning the elixir** (還丹), **jade nectar** (玉液), and the **small and great circulation** (小大周天). Those of noble birth and scholarly standing should cherish and never forget it, lest they fail to grasp its truth and practice it to its fullest.\n\nThus, upon attaining completion and realizing the Dao, one becomes a **celestial immortal** (神仙) forever, free from the sufferings of the mortal world. Is this not most fortunate? Each should strive accordingly!\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seventh: Always Doing Good to Save Others**\nTo act in goodness without leaving a trace,\nto speak in goodness without flaw,\nto advise without need of calculation,\nto close without latch or key yet unopenable,\nto bind without cords yet unbreakable—\nthis is why the **Sage** (聖人) always does good to save others,\nand thus never abandons anyone;\nalways does good to transform things,\nand thus nothing is cast aside.\n\nThis is called **inheriting clarity** (袭明).\nThus, the good person becomes the teacher of the ungood,\nand the ungood person becomes the **resource** (資) of the good.\nIf one does not honor their teacher,\nnor cherish their resource,\nthough wise, they remain in great confusion.\nThis is called **the essence of subtlety** (要妙).\n\nThe **Sage’s** heart seeks only within themselves,\nnot from others.\nIn their application to affairs and things,\n**non-action** (無為) yet nothing is unaccomplished,\nand wherever they act, it is fitting—\nwithin, they lack no self-fulfillment,\nwithout, they cause no harm to others.\n\nAs the *I Ching* says:\n*\"When the time is to stop, they stop;\nwhen the time is to act, they act—\nneither movement nor stillness loses its proper moment,\ntheir Dao is radiant and clear.\"*\nCould this not be the **Sage**?\n\nWhen it comes to action,\nthey act when the time is right—\nthat is all.\nThey see neither the source of their coming,\nnor the destination of their going—\nhow could there be any trace?\n\nTheir goodness in action is such.\n\nWhen it comes to speech,\nthey speak when the time is right—\nthat is all.\nWithin, they suffer no humiliation,\nwithout, they bring no shame to others—\nhow could there be any flaw to be criticized?\n\nTheir goodness in speech is such.\n\nAs for matters requiring calculation,\nor affairs needing deliberation,\nthey measure by **reason** (理),\nand weigh by **humanity** (情).\nThey act in accordance with reason,\nand cease when fitting with humanity—\nwhen more is needed, they give more;\nwhen less is needed, they give less.\nWhy bother with the labor of calculation?\nThis is **spontaneous response without contrivance** (因應無心),\nwhere both self and others transform naturally—\nwhat else could be called **good judgment** (善計)?\n\nThere are also matters that should be closed or bound.\nFor others, failure to close leads to chaos,\nfailure to bind leads to dispersal—\nyet the **Sage** cuts off all external ties,\nand no internal thought arises.\nComplete and whole,\nis this not what is meant by **good closure** (善閉)?\n\nThough there are no cords to bind,\nno keys to secure,\nthere is no gap to exploit—\nit is as if sealed tightly,\nand thus cannot be opened or undone.\nIs this not **the natural perfection of the Dao** (天理浑全),\nunassailable?\n\nAs for these principles,\nthey follow **the natural order of Heaven** (自然之天),\nuntainted by human contrivance.\nThus their effects are such.\n\nIn essence, they **cultivate inwardly** (內修) **while emulating outwardly** (外慕),\n**self-correcting** (自正) **without seeking anything else**.\nThis is how they **establish themselves and others** (立己立人),\nleaving no one abandoned;\n**perfect themselves and transform things** (成己成物),\ndiscarding no talent.\n\nHow great is their virtue in saving and benefiting others!\nThis is **not merely inheriting clarity** (重袭其明),\nbut also **extending it to govern and transform** (理民及物).\n\nYet the good person does not know themselves as good at first—\nthey forget the distinction between self and others,\nso the ungood revere them as teachers.\nThe good person is also not self-satisfied—\nwhen they see the ungood,\nthe good person takes them as **resources** (資).\nThey follow what is good,\nand correct what is ungood—\nthus, through this, the good person advances further in goodness,\nuntil they reach the realm of **great transformation and divine perfection** (美大化神).\n\nIf common people rely on their own talents,\nboast of their own abilities,\nand ignore the good as if it were nonexistent—\nnot learning from them as models,\nnor abandoning the ungood as worthless—\ninstead, they despise them and deem them unworthy,\nnot understanding that *\"seeing the worthy, one should emulate them;\nseeing the unworthy, one should reflect inwardly\"* (見賢思齊，不賢內省).\nThough good and evil differ,\nthey are both **teachers and resources for self-improvement** (師資).\nSuch people, who do not honor their teachers\nnor cherish their resources,\nare truly the **foolish and self-deluded** (愚而好自用，賤而好自專),\nnot the **enlightened** (昏昧人).\n\nGoodness is what one learns from,\nevil is what one takes warning from.\nWherever one encounters it,\nit benefits themselves—\nno one is without benefit to their body.\nThis is truly the **essential method for self-cultivation** (修己之要術),\nthe **wondrous Dao for governing the body** (治身之妙道).\nLet all strive accordingly!\n\nThis exposition reveals the **Sage’s** words,\nwhich encompass all things.\n\nThe principles of affairs and things\nare none other than the **Dao of life and essence** (性命之道).\n**Substance and function** (體用) are inherently unified,\n**root and branch** (本末) never separate.\n\nFor instance, *\"good action leaves no trace\"* (善行無辙迹),\nextended to the **flow of qi** (氣機流行),\nthe **self-moving celestial chariot** (河車自運),\nis also such.\n\n*\"Good speech leaves no flaw\"* (善言無瑕摘),\nmeaning there is no **method to be spoken of** (法可說),\nthis is called **spontaneous expression** (說法).\nIt is also said to be the **intention of the ancestors** (祖師西來意).\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Heaven speaks not, yet the four seasons move in their course,\nand all things are brought to birth.\"*\nIf there are flaws to be criticized,\nthen there must be speech to be seen—\nthis is not the **Sage’s** true understanding of **heart and spirit** (心領神會).\n\nThe **Buddhist school** (釋氏) says:\n*\"The Dao is originally without words,\nyet people have spoiled it by speaking of it.\"*\nThis is their meaning.\n\n*\"Good judgment requires no calculation\"* (善計無筹策),\nfor the **circulation’s** (周天) numbers\nare merely a metaphor for the three hundred transformations—\nin truth, there are no **divination lines** (爻策) to calculate.\nIf there were, it would not be the **natural fire at its proper stage** (火候).\n\n*\"Good closure has no latch or key\"* (善閉無關鍵),\nmeaning it is the **primordial chaos unbroken** (鸿蒙未破),\nthe **original spirit** (元神) silent and still,\nthe **original qi** (元氣) in profound obscurity,\nreturning to the **beginning of the Primordial** (元始之初),\nto form the embryo and become the **Sage** (聖).」\n\nIf there is closure, there must be opening—\nthis is not the Dao of inner cultivation.\n\n*\"Good binding has no cords or ties,\"*\nfor the spirit clings to qi and congeals,\nlife depends on nature and abides.\nWhen spirit and qi harmonize,\nthey return to the **Primordial Polarity (Taiji)**,\nforming the **millet-grain pearl**—\nthe body of the **Yang Spirit**.\n\nIf forced together, it is not natural congealing,\nand one cannot thereby restore life to its true essence.\nYet such is its effect.\n\nThe essence of cultivation lies only in\nturning toward the good when seeing it,\ncorrecting faults when they arise,\nlearning from the categories of good and evil,\nand reflecting inwardly to make it one’s practice.\n\nIf one boasts of talent, relies on intelligence,\ndespises the Dao and scorns others,\ndoes not honor one’s teacher,\ndoes not cherish one’s resources—\neven with talent and wisdom,\none remains a foolish man,\nunworthy of entering the Way.\n\nHere lies the subtle key to cultivation:\nthe Sage and the common man share the same path.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Eighth: Constant Virtue Does Not Depart**\n\nKnow the **masculine** and hold to the **feminine**,\nto become the **valley of the world**;\nTo be the **valley of the world**,\nconstant virtue does not depart,\nreturning to the **infant**.\n\nKnow the **white** and hold to the **black**,\nto become the **model of the world**;\nTo be the **model of the world**,\nconstant virtue does not err,\nreturning to the **Ultimate**.\n\nKnow the **honor** and hold to the **humiliation**,\nto become the **valley of the world**;\nTo be the **valley of the world**,\nconstant virtue is then complete,\nreturning to the **Uncarved Block (Pu)**.\n\nThe **Uncarved Block** scatters to become vessels;\nthe Sage uses them as **officials and leaders**.\nThus, the great **measure** is not cut.\n\nThe Dao of cultivation:\n**qi** is born from the **Yang**.\nOperate the **River Chariot (Hecarot)**, moving by **Child-Midday**.\nWhen the **lead’s qi** is fully extracted\nand the **mercury’s essence** is sufficient,\nthen lead and mercury merge into one **qi**—\nthis is when the **masculine** is united to forge the **elixir**,\nbut one must still **nurture the feminine** to nourish the **elixir**.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Know the masculine, hold to the feminine.\"*\n\nThe **masculine** is **Yang**; the **feminine** is **Yin**.\nWhen **Yin** and **Yang** harmonize,\n**masculine** and **feminine** interact,\nand **gold is hidden in water**;\n**water** again generates **gold**,\nand when the **golden qi** is full,\nthe **tidal signs** arrive.\nIts momentum is like a **valley stream**,\nflowing downward from above,\nlike the **accumulation and exhaustion** of a ravine.\n\nThe cultivator knows that **Yang** does not arise from **Yang** but from **Yin**,\nso one does not cling to the **masculine** but to the **feminine**.\nOver time, subtle **Yang** gradually emerges,\n**Yin dross** is fully transformed,\nand the **constant virtue** of returning to the **Root** and restoring **Command** must never be separated for an instant.\n\nFrom this, **Yin** and **Yang** copulate,\nforming the **immortal embryo**,\nand day by day, it is nurtured into the **infant**—\nthis is inevitable.\nAs the *Awakening to Reality* says:\n*\"Within the masculine, the feminine is embraced to form the sacred embryo.\"*\n\nOnce lead and mercury merge,\nfusing into one,\ntake this copulating essence\nand refine it in the **Kun Palace (Earth)**—\n**true lead** is born.\n\nThis is called *\"knowing the white and holding to the black.\"*\nThe **white** is **essence**; the **black** is **water**.\nBefore the **essence** is produced,\nthe **Kun body** is originally empty,\nyet through union with **Qian (Heaven)**,\n**Kun** becomes **Kan (Water)**.\nThus, **gold is born from water**,\nnourished by the **Mother Qi**.\nHence it is called **Mother Qi**.\nAs the *Awakening to Reality* says:\n*\"From the black, take the white as the elixir’s mother.\"*\n\nWhen **true lead** is obtained,\nuse a drop of one’s own **mercury** to welcome it.\nLifting left and right,\nquietly await the **White Tiger’s** head passing through.\nIf one hears the **thunder beneath the earth**,\nthere is indeed the **elixir-heart piercing the sun**,\n**overwhelming qi reaching the heavens**—\nI remain steadfast in my **void-cave**,\nnot the least perturbed.\nThis is the time of **refining essence into qi**.\n\nAfterward, operate the **wheelbarrow (lunlu)**,\nascend the **three vehicles (sanjia)**,\nfrom the **double spine-gate** up to the **cinnabar field (daniwan)**,\nfollowing the **four cardinal directions (zi-wu-mao-you)**,\nand aligning with the **four seasons**.\nThis is to be the **model of the world**.\n\nAll things—growth, contraction, storage, and return—\ndo not differ in the slightest from the **Heaven’s transformations**.\n\nThus, ascending and descending,\nreturning to the **earthly furnace**,\ntransforming the **manifest** back to the **unmanifest**,\nreturning to the **Ultimate Void**.\nThis is the **Great Circulation’s** moment—\nthe **jade liquid elixir** is here.\n\nAt this time, the **golden elixir** returns to the **mysterious orifice**,\nmerging with the **true unity of the Azure Dragon’s qi**,\nrefining into the **non-dual Primordial Spirit**—\nthis is the time of **refining qi into spirit**.\n\nTo cultivate further, the Dao of **refining spirit back to the void**—\nonly **mixed and indistinct**,\nnurturing the **void**;\n**blended and submerged**,\nperfecting **principle and qi**;\ntransforming **discrimination into wisdom**,\nbecoming **holy yet appearing foolish**.\n\n「Each day and night,\nspeak not lightly,\nmind free of other thoughts—\nlike a simpleton,\nutterly without knowledge or perception.\n\nThough insults come in abundance,\nstand as though unaware,\njust as **Shun** dwelled in the deep mountains,\nno different from a mountain recluse.\n\nThis is the **honor of the sage**,\nthe **humiliation of the immortal**.\n\nUnless thus, one cannot **nurture the void** and **harmonize with the Dao**.\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"Open the mouth, the spirit-qi scatters,\ndisturbed thoughts chill the fire’s alchemy.\nHe who knows to return and restore—\nhis golden treasure weighs like mountains.\"*\n\nIf one rashly speaks a word,\nor recklessly harbors a thought,\nthen one is like a thief of the elixir.\n\nThe Dao grows higher,\nthe path grows riskier.\nAt this stage of elixir refinement,\nit is the most perilous terrain—\nthus ancient masters,\nafter attaining **fruit of the Dao**,\nfeigned deafness and dumbness,\nacted mad and deranged—\nall for the sake of **nurturing the void** and **harmonizing with the Dao**.\n\nWhy else would they endure such suffering?\n\nFor the mind holds nothing,\nthis is the **ultimate valley** of the world.\n\nAs the **ultimate valley**,\none must further **cool the intent like ice**,\n**clarify the heart as water**,\nand only then can the **constant’s** mysterious **virtue/power** be fully realized.\n\nYet **true emptiness is not emptiness**,\n**wondrous existence is not existence**.\nAt first, from **void** to **manifest**,\nthen from **manifest** to **void**,\nuntil **void** and **manifest** stand not.\n\nThis is the **returning to the origin**,\n**restoring to the Primordial Simplicity**—\nthe Dao of **Great Circulation** achieved.\n\nThough, when gathered, it is one,\nwhen dispersed, it is myriad.\nIn eternal generation,\nin endless transformation—\nwhere is not the **vessel’s** dwelling?\nWhere is not the **Primordial Simplicity’s** scattering?\n\nThis is the saying of **Primordial Simplicity scattering as vessels**.\n\nThe **sage** applies it:\nnot clinging to **vessels** yet scattering **Primordial Simplicity**,\nmeaning **void** and **stillness** rule as the **master of the body**,\nthe **total support of all transformations**—\nlike the world’s officials, none second.\n\nAnd what is meant by *\"the Great Measure does not cut\"*?\nIt is the **Dao’s** all-encompassing embrace,\nno excess in its bounds,\nno distortion in its fulfillment—\nsufficient for governance.\nIf it cuts, then it is artificial,\nnot the **original nature** of **Heaven**.\n\nThe **sage** does not cut,\nmerely returning to the **mixed and indistinct** **Heaven**.\n\nDo scholars understand this?\n\nIf one examines **Confucius’** chapter on *\"The Container of Virtue\"* alongside,\nthen the essence of **refining essence**,\n**refining qi**,\n**refining spirit** is fully grasped.\n\nYet, its subtleties I dare speak of again:\n*\"Formerly, when I met my teacher,\nhe gave the oral precept:\n‘Only concentrate spirit into the qi orifice.’\"*\n\nUnless one **returns the light** and **reflects the brilliance** to the elixir field,\nthen **golden water** will remain turbid.\n\nOnce knowing to **concentrate spirit in the Kundalini Palace**,\nif one ceases the **constant practice**,\nthen **water and fire** will scatter,\nand from where will the **Primordial Unity’s** **pre-heaven qi** arise?\n\nThough **concentrating spirit** is essential,\n**regulating breath** is no less so.\n\nIf one knows to **concentrate spirit in the qi orifice**,\nyet fails to **regulate inhalation and exhalation**,\nsending breath downward into the **yin cave**,\nthen though spirit may dwell,\nbreath will not flow freely—\nno means to **fan the wind** and **stir the fire**,\nto **still ordinary breath** and **reveal true breath**,\nto **quell ordinary mind** and **awaken true mind**.\n\nAnd since **spirit-fire** entirely depends on **spirit-breath**,\nif **spirit-breath** does not blow,\nnot only will **water and fire** remain unclean,\nbut the **golden embryo** will fail to refine.\n\nOnce **spirit is concentrated** and **breath is regulated**,\none knows where to **return and restore**—\nat the moment when **spirit merges** and **qi flows freely**,\nlike **Heaven** before its opening,\ndark and indistinct,\nthen all wandering thoughts and turbid qi\ncan be gathered and purified,\njust as the **sun and moon** undergo a cycle of eclipse,\nrevealing a new brilliance.\nThus, **silent and still**,\nat the time of **no knowledge, no awareness**,\nsuddenly **knowledge and awareness** arise—\nthis is the **Great Circulation’s** foundation,\nthe **mysterious pass’s** manifestation,\nthe **first stir of yang**,\nthe **beginning of all things**.\n\nIf one can **seize this moment**,\n**grasp it firmly**,\nthen it is truly the **handling of mist and clouds**.\n\nThe **elixir canon** says *\"When the time comes, the spirit knows\"*,\nand *\"The true child is active at the moment\"*—\nthis is what is meant.\n\nAt this moment, one must **harvest it immediately**;\nif delayed even slightly,\nthen **post-heaven knowledge and awareness** will intrude,\nunfit for the **golden elixir’s** medicine.\n\nThis **critical juncture**,\none must **lay down all entanglements**,\n**raise no thought**,\nand swiftly seek with **true intent**—\nonly then does one obtain the **true pure medicine**.\n\nOne must **be still again and again**,\n**sink deeper and deeper**,\nand in the time of **no knowledge, no awareness**,\nseek the place of **knowledge and awareness**—\nthen perhaps it will be found.\n\nIf one says *\"no thought arises\"*,\nwhy then does one **seek with intent**?\nIs it not that **seeking with intent** itself\nfalls into **post-heaven knowledge and awareness**?\n\nYet one does not know—\nthis **true intent**,\nlike a **hidden flame**,\nnot seen yet always present—\nmerely **moved by the mechanism**, the **spirit follows naturally**,\nsuch is the **spontaneous response**.\n\nIf one says **true intent** is truly **intent**,\nthen it falls into **rigidity**.\nIf one says **true intent** is truly **no intent**,\nthen it drifts into **stubborn emptiness**.\n\nBetween **intent** and **no intent**,\nthe student must **awaken to this**.\n\nThe *I Ching* says:\n*\"Quietly still, yet unmoved,\nit responds and thus communicates\"*—\nthis is it.\n\nOnly then is **true knowing, true awareness**,\nall driven by **true intent**.\n\nThough, **true intent** arises from **true heart**,\none must have a **heart emptied and pure**,\nits brilliance unincreased by **having**,\nunlessened by **lacking**.\nWith this **true heart**,\nonly then is **true intent**.\nWith this **true intent**,\nonly then is **true breath**.\n\nOne must **possess insight**,\n**never miss the opportunity**,\nthen each refinement yields its own **growth and benefit**.\n\nAt this stage,\nif one **constantly harvests**,\nthen **true yang** will naturally emerge.\nOne must further **refine oneself** and **await the moment**,\nnever harboring even a hint of **forcing movement**,\nthen **post-heaven knowledge and awareness** will not intrude,\nand the **pre-heaven’s** **ultimate yang essence**,\nthe **Primordial Unity’s qi**,\nwill through **long cultivation** accumulate—\nthen the **great medicine** will arise,\ncapable of **returning youth** and **reversing aging.**»\n\nOnly fear is the unwillingness to accumulate merit and practice to establish **external cultivation**.\nUphold propriety in conduct and refine the moral order to cultivate **inner virtue**—\nthis alone serves as the foundation for reception.\n\nThe common saying goes:\n*\"Not fearing one instance,\nonly fearing accumulation.\nNot fearing suddenness,\nonly fearing contrivance.\"*\nTruly, these words are wise.\n\nThe student who seeks to know the **Dao of intent** must not merely rely on spontaneity.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Eliminate Excess and Extremity**\n\n*\"If one seeks to take the world by force,\nI see it as inevitable failure.\nThe world is a divine instrument—\nit cannot be seized, cannot be grasped.\nTo act upon it brings ruin;\nto cling to it brings loss.\"*\n\nThus, things either move or follow,\nare drawn in or exhaled,\nare strong or weak.\nTherefore, the Sage eliminates excess,\neliminates extravagance,\neliminates excessiveness.\n\nThe **Dao** is originally without sound or scent,\npure and natural in its clarity.\nThe practitioner must also remain unknowing and unrecognizing,\npurely yielding to nature—\nthis is the heart-seal of ancestors from antiquity to the present,\nunalterable and beyond deviation.\n\nYet, the world’s heterodox sects mock our **Way** as solitary cultivation and silent refinement,\nultimately calling it stubborn emptiness and uselessness.\nHow could I not reflect upon this?\n\n*\"If one seeks to govern the world with active measures,\nI see that the more one acts, the more inevitable failure becomes.\nThe world, though vast, is originally governed by the divine instrument.\nWhat is called the **Primordial Dao** is the silent, natural one.\nThe world is the framework of the divine instrument;\nthe divine instrument is the sovereign of the world.\nThe world may be acted upon, but the divine instrument cannot be seized.\nIf one acts upon it, at first there is confusion and excess,\nuntil restraints are abandoned and boundaries transgressed,\nand **Heaven’s virtue** is utterly exhausted—\nthis is precisely why action leads to ruin.\nHow much better to succeed through **non-action** than to fail through action!\nHow much better to attain the **Dao** through non-attachment than to lose through attachment!\"*\n\nSince the **Dao** originates from **Heaven**,\nand **Heaven’s Way** is **non-action**,\nyet spontaneous transformation arises within it—\nhow could it be otherwise?\n\nObserve the moment of birth:\nThe **Primordial Yang** initiates with **Heaven’s Element**—\nsometimes **yang** moves forward first;\n**Earth’s Element** sustains life—\nsometimes **yin** follows afterward.\nMotion and stillness interdependently root each other,\neach with its necessity.\n\nAs for **qi**—\nwhen extended, it bends inward, and inhalation arises naturally;\nwhen contracted, it expands, and exhalation flows effortlessly.\nThus, **vital breath** flourishes,\nand **generative vitality** endures forever.\n\nYet, due to differing endowments,\nsome are strong with abundant **qi** and robust **essence**,\nothers weak with scarce **qi** and feeble **essence**—\nall these are disparities of **post-heaven** cultivation.\nSince things are inherently distinct,\nsometimes **qi** ascends vigorously,\nsometimes it descends gently—\nall these are the natural operations of **Heaven’s Way**,\nbeyond human contrivance.\n\nEven at the outset, there may be traces of effort,\nyet one must follow the momentum and align with the moment—\nacting when appropriate, resting when due,\nblending effort with spontaneity,\nso that over time it remains unspent.\n\nThis is why the Sage, when gathering medicinal herbs or refining elixirs,\nmust eliminate what is already excessive,\neliminate what is overly extravagant,\neliminate what is overly extreme—\nalways returning to moderation,\nconstantly embodying harmony.\nThough it may seem like **action**,\nit is equal to **non-action**;\nthough it may seem like **doing**,\nit is the same as **non-doing**.\n\nThus, **being** and **non-being** generate each other—\nonly then can one speak of the **Great Dao**.\nThis is the saying: *\"The **Great Dao** is **non-action**\"*—\n**non-action** being the study of **nurturing innate nature**;\nyet it also involves **action**—\n**action** being the craft of **cultivating post-heaven life**.\nOne must know that **action** and **non-action**,\nthough differing in their names for cultivating **nature and life**,\nshare the same sovereign principle—\nnever to be moved arbitrarily,\nfor movement is deviation from the **Middle**.\n\nWhether **action** or **non-action** is improper,\nthe key is to maintain the **Middle** without confusion,\nto know the times and circumstances,\nto advance when opportunity arises,\nto retreat when difficulty comes—\nthen **non-action** is achieved,\nand **action** is also attained.\n\nWhat is this **sovereign principle**?\nIt is the **divine instrument of the world**.\nIf one knows the original source,\nreturning to **undifferentiated unity**,\n**void yet luminous, unobscured**—\ninitially, **action** is necessary;\nultimately, **non-action** is necessary.\nOtherwise, if one insists on **non-action** and spontaneity alone,\nwhy did Confucius speak of the **Dao**,\nwhy did he speak of **striving to practice**,\nwhy did he speak of **choosing the good and holding fast**?\n\nKnow that the **Way of self-cultivation** lies in **nature and life**;\nthe **work of nature and life** requires balancing ease and effort,\nnot rigidly distinguishing them—\nall depends on the **divine clarity of virtue**.\n\nAs in governing a state:\norder is maintained through culture,\nchaos through force—\nresponding to the times, acting in accordance with **Heaven**,\nthus harmonizing left and right,\nnever failing to meet the occasion.\n\nThis is the **Dao** for the enlightened—\ndifficult to convey to the rigid and dull.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty: The Virtuous Achieve Fruit**\n\n*\"Those who assist the sovereign with the **Dao**\ndo not use force to dominate the world—\ntheir affairs return favorably:\nwhere the army encamps, brambles grow;\nafter great battles, there are years of famine.\nThus, the virtuous achieve **fruit** alone,\ndaring not to seek strength through it.\nAchieve **fruit** without arrogance,\nachieve **fruit** without boasting,\nachieve **fruit** only when unavoidable,\nachieve **fruit** without coercion.\nWhen things reach their peak, they grow old—\nthis is called **not the Way**,\nand **not the Way** perishes early.\"*\n\nIn the ancient world,\neach ruler governed their own realm,\neach remembered their people—\nharmonious and bright,\nsharing a peaceful **Heaven** without strife;\nself and others forgotten,\nboundaries dissolved in transformation—\nhow could there be warfare?\n\nWhen shared labor led to chaos and warfare arose,\n**Chiyou** rebelled against **Heaven**, and arms were raised.\nThus, culture had **jade and silk**,\nmartial arts had **weapons and armor**;\ngovernance relied on **ritual and music**,\nchaos on **spears and shields**—\nhence, courts valued both **culture and martial virtue** equally.\n\nYet the **Dao**-aligned sage-ruler, enlightened and in high station,\nassists the flourishing court,\naids in establishing **order**,\nserving the sovereign solely through the **Way**,\nnever coercing the world with arms.\n\nWhy is this so?\nFor he who slays another’s father and brother,\nothers will likewise slay his father and brother.\nHuman hearts yearn to return to harmony,\n**Heaven’s** **Dao** favors restoration.\nGrudges and retribution know no end.\n\nMoreover, where armies pass,\nthe people suffer harm;\nwhere troops march,\neven chickens and dogs perish.\nThus, slaughter and death multiply—\ncorpses fill great ravines,\nblood pools at long walls.\nHighborn and lowly alike\nbecome mere bones.\nThe living are fewer than the dead,\nthe dead outnumber the living.\n\nThus, villages fall silent,\nfields lie abandoned,\nand thorns take root.\n\nThe **killing qi** severely harms **Great Harmony**,\nthe **perverse winds** provoke **Heaven’s** wrath.\nConsequently, **yin** and **yang** fail to blend,\nrain and sun come untimely—\ndrought and flood alternate,\ndisasters strike in succession,\nfamine follows hard upon hunger,\nand the people face ruin before nightfall.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"After a great army, famine must follow—*\n*inevitable fate.\"*\n\nYet when hunger and cold press hard,\nbanditry grows daily;\nwhen years bring scarcity,\nrebellions erupt—\nsometimes war is unavoidable.\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Warfare values swiftness over hesitation,\"*\nso the skilled warrior acts decisively.\n\nA **ren**-**yi** army arrives like timely rain,\nrescuing those suspended in peril,\ngreeted with **hújiāng** [milk and wine].\nAs when **King Wu** in single campaign\npacified the realm—\nnot for personal glory,\nnor to crush the enemy’s leader alone.\nHow dare one indulge in slaughter for a moment,\nor seize strength for oneself!\n\nIf victorious, do not boast—\nboasting breeds love of war;\ndo not self-praise—\nself-praise harbors hidden martial ambition.\nEven if subduing tyrants as easily as turning a palm,\nelevating the people to prosperity,\nthis is but the common duty of generals—\nhow could it be cause for arrogance?\n\nFor arrogance breeds killing.\nEven if boldness leads to chaos,\nsaving the people from fire and water,\nif three treacherous intentions lurk within—\nthough no blood is spilled,\nthe seed of slaughter is already sown.\nThis is **not the Way**.\n\nKnow this: war is a last resort for sages,\nyet even without losing a single soldier,\nwithout breaking a single general,\nwithout harming a single civilian,\nwithout damaging a single thing,\nit cannot claim to restore **peace’s** refined order.\nWhat then of those who are not sages?\nAct decisively, but without coercion.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"Exhort the lord not to seek noble titles—*\n*one man’s triumph means ten thousand bones lie dry.\"*\nReflect on this: war is perilous,\nbattle is a deadly omen—\n**not the Way** of nurturing life.\n\nWhat of prolonged conflict,\ndragging on for years,\nexhausting troops and treasury,\nalienating subjects and provoking resentment?\nIf it can end yet does not,\nhow can it serve the state?\n\nOr when armies face off in stalemate,\nyear after year, supplies dwindling—\na single moment’s negligence,\nand the enemy seizes the pass,\ncutting off grain and provisions—\nsoldiers flee at the first rumor,\ntroops scatter at the first sign,\nonce-mighty forces reduced to ashes.\nWhat wonder is there in this?\n\nFor it is true: when things reach their peak, they grow old—\nthis is the inevitable course.\n\nWar is used to punish the un-**Dao** with the **Dao**.\nYet if one delights in war and strife,\npretending to pacify the people while harming them,\nclaiming to suppress chaos while fostering it—\nthis is the ultimate **not the Way**.\n\nTo punish the un-**Dao** while acting un-**Dao** oneself—\nhow much better to cultivate fields, repel bandits,\nrest armies, and foster neighborly peace,\nacting early rather than late.\n\nTake **Yu’s** conquest of the **Three Miao**:\nthe Miao people resisted stubbornly,\nyet **Yu** did not rely on arms but on **virtue**—\ndancing the **dry-羽** at the two stages,\nand in seventy years, the Miao submitted.\nThis is **威** without coercion,\n**武** without force—\nfar surpassing brute power.\nDo rulers know this?\n\nThis speaks of **fire-alchemy**,\n**symbolic correspondence**,\n**gathering** and **refining**—\nall deliberate action.\nYet compared to waging war and conquering enemies,\nit is a far graver affair,\nnot to be taken lightly.\n\nAs **Zengzi** tempered himself in battle,\n**Zisi** warned of caution in war—\nonly then can one transform **qi** and essence,\nrestoring the original **pre-Heaven** form.\n\nLike the unbroken maiden’s purity,\nuntouched and unharmed,\none may act in due season,\nfollow the **Way** without bias,\nencounter no peril or danger,\nand reach the realm of **spiritual transformation**.\n\nBut for the broken and the aged,\nwhen **post-Heaven** lead and mercury near exhaustion—\nwhere does life depend?\nOne must resort to **enumerating bamboo to summon tortoises**,\n**playing the zither to call phoenixes**—\nonly then do **jade sprouts** and **spiritual herbs** appear,\n**pills and elixirs** ready for gathering and refining,\ntransmuting the mortal form into nothingness,\nforming the **sage-embryo** at the **Linguan** [spiritual pass].\n\nYet the **fire-alchemy** requires utmost precision—\nwithout a true master’s oral transmission,\none cannot penetrate its subtleties.\nEven if the secrets of **Heaven’s** mechanisms are obtained,\nif inner **virtue** or outer practice falls short,\n**Heaven and the numinous** will not aid.\n\nOnly with a **empty heart** seeking the **Way**,\naccumulating **virtue** and cultivating **power**,\nwithout guilt in any deed,\nwith **ren** in every moment,\nhumble, yielding, patient, and gentle—\n**spirit** abiding in **qi**,\n**qi** clinging to **spirit**,\nunbroken continuity,\nrooted in the deepest foundation—\nnever forgetting at the right time,\nnever abandoning in distraction,\nalways mindful without ceasing.\n\nThus it is said: *\"He who aids the sovereign with the Dao does not rely on arms to subdue the world.\"* Even if one attains perfect refinement, yet after the fire-alchemical tempering, when all coarse *qi* has been purged and true *qi* has yet to accumulate, one’s state will be indeterminate—neither fully present nor fully absent, subtle and hard to discern. Moreover, there are those who, without refining, see their *qi* scatter, and those whose *qi* scatters the more they refine—all due to the mind’s fluctuations, like creeping vines that resist eradication. Hence it is said: *\"Where the teacher treads, brambles spring up.\"* How much more so when the divine fire is kindled, and the yin-*qi* cannot be retained, while long-standing ailments and childhood infirmities are all driven forth—some exiting through sweat and filth, others manifesting as sores and toxins, in varied forms.\n\nThe cultivator must not be alarmed by these as illness; only a tranquil mind can transmute *qi*. It is clear that the Way of self-refinement must transform the common body into a jade-like one, the turbid form into a golden one. Never be startled—for alarm stirs the posterior-heaven’s vulgar fire, gravely injuring the primal *qi*.\n\nThus it is said: *\"After a great campaign, there will surely be years of hardship.\"* The skilled warrior values decisiveness; the adept alchemist values divine swiftness. Hence it is said: *\"Decisive, and nothing more.\"* When the cultivator reaches this stage of pure yang transformation, he must not rely on his strength—assuming he can go without hunger or thirst, move like the wind, dispense with stove in winter or fan in summer, and wield extraordinary powers far beyond the common man, boasting of his might. Such self-conceit stirs the posterior-heaven’s vulgar fire anew; even if he avoids external censure, his inner elixir will surely falter. What need to speak of those who, after ten months of gestation and three years of nursing, complete every task with clockwork precision, then vaunt their achievements, arrogantly lording over others? Such behavior is far from the vessel of the Dao.\n\nEven if one succeeds in deeds, one must also succeed in repaying debts. The peril of collapse is beyond reckoning!\n\nWorse still, if one relies on his strength while failing to cultivate humility and sincerity, even if he practices virtue and concentrates on the Dao, he will be like a rigid tree—strong yet lifeless—unable to rival the supple, fragile yet vital plant. Day by day, year by year, as time passes, his vital essence will only wane. How could he then long enjoy the pleasures of mortal life?\n\nThus it is said: *\"When things are at their peak, decay follows.\"* From this, it is clear that those who exalt themselves only bring themselves low, and those who boast only court danger. How un-Dao!\n\nBetter to abandon rigid strength, to be plain and unassuming, to accept fate with equanimity, letting heaven arrange all things—thus achieving strength without striving, the Dao without effort. Here lies the peril of the initial fire-alchemical practice; let the scholar beware.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Tranquility and Simplicity as Supreme**\n\nWarfare is an ominous instrument; men detest it, and thus those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it. The gentleman, in peace, values the left; in war, the right. Warfare is no instrument of the gentleman—it is used only when unavoidable, and even then, tranquility is paramount. To rejoice in victory is to delight in killing, and he who delights in killing cannot prevail in the world.\n\nThus, auspicious rites favor the left, while inauspicious ones favor the right. Hence, the left is reserved for the vice-general, the right for the supreme commander, both treated with funeral rites. Many lives lost demand lamentation; victory, too, is met with funeral rites. The sage governs the world with virtue and morality as supreme, law and teaching secondary. Only when absolutely necessary does he raise armies, prepare arms, and send his eldest sons to war, his younger to bear the dead. To do so is to invite calamity—*the Book of Changes* warns deeply against it.\n\nHow much worse for those who indulge in the ferocity of the tiger’s gaze, the eagle’s boldness, who flaunt arms on the battlefield and wield might in the barracks, who see conquest as gain and war as skill! Such warfare is not merely chaotic—it is the very epitome of disorder. For the finest weapon is not the one that kills, but the one that ceases killing. The ancients called halting the blade *wu* (martial virtue); these men call exhaustion of arms their prowess—yet such is no instrument for the ruler.\n\nWhat, then, is the ruler’s true instrument? The Dao. Virtue. The love of life and hatred of slaughter. To speak of arms is to invite killing.\n\nWhen the clamor of slaughter resounds, when rivers and mountains tremble, even chickens and dogs are unsettled—what horror is there beyond? How much more so for worms that cling to life, ants that fear death? Even the most insignificant creatures recoil from it—what then of men? Thus, those who follow the Dao avoid it entirely.\n\nAll things value yang over yin—the left, representing yang, is the breath of life; the right, representing yin, is the seed of slaughter. Therefore, the gentleman, in ordinary times, honors the left. Only in war does he abandon the left for the right, revealing how deeply he despises arms.\n\nEven if one must remove tyrants, punish the wicked, and rescue the people—raising righteous banners and forming disciplined ranks—warfare remains an ominous instrument, one even the sage avoids. In times of peace, a nation needs no martial preparations. When borders cry out in distress and rebellion flares, and only then must arms be raised, they must be wielded with precision, rewards and punishments meted out with rigor. Where the army marches, the people offer water and grain; where the soldiers pass, the fields remain undisturbed. This is the way of subduing both the yielding and the rigid—through awe and virtue—clearly demonstrated.\n\nLet there be no display of martial might, no boasting of strategic brilliance. Only tranquility and non-action, ease and naturalness.\n\n「Though dwelling in lands of tumultuous warfare, he maintains an orderly and tranquil demeanor among his troops.\n\nWith this, how could any city not be taken? With this, how could any enemy not be crushed? Victory is assured.\n\nYet still, such victories are but commonplace in the art of war—how can one claim glory like inscribed tripods, or record exploits in banners and armor? Would one thus set this as a model for future generations?\n\nIf this were held as a model, it would inevitably mean enduring the suffering of countless commoners to gain personal fame and fortune. Without the virtue of a life-giving being, yet harboring the intent to kill, how can this be justified?\n\nHe who delights in killing, his heart is cruel, his methods harsh and unyielding. Unable to embrace broad tolerance, he is ever petty and self-righteous.\n\nSuch a person cannot aspire to dominion over the world. If he were to achieve dominion, the masses would have no survivors.\n\nIn ancient times, auspicious rites were held on the left, and inauspicious on the right. A subordinate general, being second in rank, should reside on the left, yet he is placed on the right; a supreme general, being highest in rank, should reside on the right, yet he is placed on the left.\n\nThis is but the knowledge that he who holds absolute authority over slaughter and conquest is the supreme general. Subordinate generals must obey his commands and may not flaunt their own martial might—this is akin to treating funeral rites as military rites.\n\nHow much more fitting is it to engage in a solemn exchange of state letters, and to command soldiers to sing dirges for the deceased?\n\nThis is the utmost of caution and restraint.\n\nAnd what of the saying, *“He who kills many should weep with sorrow”*? It reveals that warfare is a grievous matter, one that wounds the natural compassion for all life, and arises only from dire necessity!\n\nThus, those who visit ancient battlefields see corpses filling the city walls and moats, blood pooling in the trenches and ravines, as if the heavens and earth themselves weep in sorrow, and the grasses and trees sigh in grief—what then of the people?\n\nEven if victorious in battle, with enemy chieftains subdued and the masses at peace, upon reflection, one sees that half the innocent children beneath the heavens are made to wander as refugees, and half perish. The heart is filled with sorrow!\n\nHow dare one return in triumph, boast of victories, and praise one’s own prowess?\n\nTo harbor such thoughts without a shred of virtue, yet display only remorse, is to treat oneself as one already in mourning.\n\nMencius said:\n*“I am skilled in forming ranks, I am skilled in waging war—this is a great crime!\nOnly when a sovereign loves virtue does the world stand without rival.”*\nAnd again:\n*“To awe the world is not done by the might of arms.”*\n\nThis clearly demonstrates that martial prowess without slaughter, and the virtuous without enemies, are the true models for an age of peace. Yet the use of arms is not the usual way of the sage, nor something the worthy ruler esteems.\n\nThis analogy is like using fire at the furnace—an act of necessity for the aged and infirm, to revive and mend what is broken, not to be done lightly. How can one claim singular merit or boast of extraordinary skill?\n\nThose who pursue the false paths of leftist Dao, such as kindling flames to retreat from calamity, gathering herbs to forge elixirs, or all manner of contrived actions, mistakenly believe these to be the way of the immortals. They are far astray!\n\nYet the vigor of youth requires no such labor—one may attain the elixir effortlessly. But the aged body, long steeped in physical decay and worldly desires, without the fierce refining and urgent tempering of Daoic practice, will find that its vital essence remains untransformed, and its desires unvanquished.\n\nWith a defiled and polluted body, how can one practice the Dao of non-action and naturalness?\n\nThis is like trying to welcome honored guests in a filthy dwelling—impossible!\n\nOne must first purify the impurities within oneself, and only then will form and matter dissolve, the root of attachment be eradicated, and the original true nature manifest freely within.\n\nAlthough one may forcefully cultivate, it must still be done with ease and naturalness, lest the post-heavenly fire of effort harm one’s innate vitality.\n\nThus, the highest ideal is to embrace tranquility and non-action, to achieve victory without glory.\n\nOtherwise, one has only post-heavenly cultivation without pre-heavenly foundation, mere common qi without true essence. A single breath of fiery passion—how long can it endure?\n\nHence it is said: *“Those who take pride in this are those who delight in killing.”*\nTo delight in killing is to nurture a heart brimming with slaughter—how can such a one be the master of the world and receive its blessings?\n\nIt is certain that he cannot aspire to dominion over the world.\n\nTherefore, those who cultivate the Dao, though they employ action as their practice, must also possess a heart of benevolence and compassion, one of humility and gentleness. Only then will the post-heavenly align with the pre-heavenly.\n\nThe ancients understood the fire’s tempering without reliance on divination, and the measure of medicines without weighing scales. They moved in harmony with the heavens and acted in accordance with their true nature.\n\nThough they engaged in action, they did no harm.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Knowing the Stopping Point Brings No Peril**\n\nThe Dao/Way is ever nameless.\nThough crude and simple, the world dares not submit to it.\nIf lords and kings could but guard it,\nAll things would willingly come as guests.\n\nHeaven and earth unite in embrace,\nAnd sweet dew descends—\nNo one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.\n\nWhen first the Dao/Way is cultivated with form,\nAnd form is given a name,\nOne must know when to stop—\nFor knowing the stopping point brings no peril.\n\nThe Dao/Way in the world is like streams and valleys to the great rivers and seas.\nThe Dao/Way itself is boundless and formless,\nYet truly all phenomena stand in orderly array,\nNo person lacks it, no thing is without it.\n\nBefore humans took form,\nThis essence was their foundation.\nAfter humans were born,\nThis essence became their root.\n\nThough it be most subtle and hidden,\nOne must never for a moment be parted from it—\nFor separation means all affairs and things collapse into ruin.\n\nHence it is said: *“The Dao/Way is ever nameless.”*\nYet for the sake of those who study it,\nOne must give it a name.\n\nA single grain of millet, the yang spirit three inches long,\nDwelling in the mysterious palace of self-sojourning,\nPermeating the dharma realm,\nIs like the pristine and complete *Taipu* (太朴).\n\nThough its form be small,\nIts function is vast.\n\nAll affairs and things in the world\nRely upon this as their sovereign—\nWho dares to submit to it afterward?\n\nEven as lords and kings wield the authority of life and death,\nAnd stand as masters of the myriad people,\nWho dares not obey their commands?\n\nThe man who attains this *Taipu* (太朴),\nWith unwavering reverence and devotion,\nPreserves it without ever losing it—\nEven from distant lands and foreign shores,\nThey come by sea and mountain paths,\nHow much more so those nearby?\n\nThus it is seen that all nations submit as guests,\nAll due to this *Taipu*’s power to safeguard.\n\nYet after a man is born,\nHis **qi** and innate nature constrain him,\nAnd desires for things blind him—\nFew indeed are those who retain the Dao/Way.\n\nIf one wishes to embrace *Taipu* and remain whole and pure,\nOnly by imitating Heaven and Earth can this be done.\n\nHeaven’s **qi** descends, Earth’s **qi** ascends—\nLike man’s yin-yang (*kān-lí* 坎離) union,\nWater and fire in harmonious balance.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite,\nSweet dew descends like pearls,\nNaturally falling into the *Zhonggong* (中宮)—\nThis is the interplay of yin and yang,\nThe sun and moon sharing the same palace—\nWho makes them do so?\nWho commands their harmony?\n\nAll is due to the Dao/Way as their sovereign.\n\nBut what name does the Dao/Way truly have?\nSome call it *\"Zhenqian\"* (真鉛),\nOthers *\"Jindan\"* (金丹).\n\nThe ancients coined these names\nOnly for the benefit of later practitioners.\n\nOnce practitioners know its name,\nThey must seek its true essence.\n\nFrom the very moment yin and yang unite,\nA single point descends into the Yellow Court—\nOne must then remain steadfast in its place, unmoving in its dwelling,\nOnly then does the Great Dao endure.\n\nOnce one knows where to halt,\nThe central sovereign abides unshaken—\nWhy then should one suffer birth and death,\nOr fall prey to danger and peril?\n\nFor the Dao, when dispersed abroad,\nIs boundless as the vast heavens,\nMysterious as the primordial chaos.\nYet when gathered within,\nIt is indistinct, formless—\nRetreating, yet profound in its concealment.\n\nIf scholars fail to grasp its fundamental principle,\nThey cannot find their true resting place.\nThen they scatter without order,\nUnable even to establish themselves—\nHow could they ever hope to transcend others?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the sea.\"*\n\nOnly by returning to its source\nDoes one achieve its fullness.\n\nAs Master Zisi taught:\n*\"The Way of the virtuous is subtle yet profound—*\n*This is the single root from which myriad branches arise,*\n*And all branches return to that single root.\"*\n\nIn this chapter, the sweet dew is born\nFrom the union of lead and mercury,\nAnd *\"knowing where to halt\"* is the gathering of divine qi in the Yellow Court.\n\nThe *Taishang* speaks of this in general terms;\nNow I shall elaborate the Dao for the seeker:\n\nThose who wish to cultivate life and nature\nMust first clarify lead and mercury.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Mercury is the original substance of my family,*\n*Lead is the immortal elixir of another house.\"*\n\nIf one speaks only of mind and nature,\nThere is no way to grasp it—\nThus the ancient immortals named it *mercury*.\n\nThis mercury is not external—\nIt is the soul’s essence, the vital fluid within:\nFrom tears, saliva, semen, blood, and the refined qi of the body,\nThe turbid residues of post-heaven transformation,\nIlluminated by divine fire for long ages,\nUntil it becomes the most refined essence.\n\nThis essence is the vessel of original nature—\nPure, untainted, equal to the boundless void.\nIf one relies solely on the post-heaven physical essence,\nAnd stirs it with martial or civil fire,\nWithout divine illumination,\nThe essence will not transform,\nAnd the soul’s nature will have no foundation.\n\nThus, those who refine the elixir\nMust first refine essence into qi—\nAs the saying goes:\n*\"This essence is not the common man’s—*\n*It is the Jade Emperor’s saliva from his mouth.\"*\n\nThe Jade Emperor is but a metaphor for the heart;\nThe heart’s essence is that saliva.\n\nOnce essence generates mercury,\nThe essence descends into the *kān* (坎) palace,\nWhile true yang ascends,\nTheir union in the Yellow Court’s inner cauldron—\nI gather divine qi here,\nAnd over time, true lead emerges,\nBurgeoning like silk threads—\nThis is what is called *\"obtaining the medicine.\"*\n\nYet this essence is true water,\nTrue yang is true qi,\nAnd true qi is lead.\nMercury is essence, lead is the common substance—\nBoth are post-heaven, tangible lead and mercury,\nUseful only for procreation,\nNot for the elixir of immortality.\n\nOnly when mercury descends\nAnd lead ascends,\nMeeting in the central palace,\nWith concentrated spirit and regulated breath,\nDoes the vapor rise—\nLike mist, like smoke,\nLike tides, like the sea—\nOnly then is it true lead,\nThe foundation for elixir refinement—\nThe union of *kān* and *lí* yielding the medicine.\n\nThen, stirring yang fire and yin talisman,\nAscending from the tailbone to the brain’s marrow.\nThe brain’s marrow, long storing yin essence,\nCombines with this true lead-qi,\nForming a unity—\nThis is *\"heaven and earth unite to form the elixir.\"*\n\nWhen yang ascends to the brain’s marrow,\nWhat does one perceive?\nA clarity of mind and senses,\nNo longer the usual daze—\nLike wind dispersing clouds,\nThe sky clears, the air is pure—\nA new and wondrous state—\nOnly then is it true mercury.\nThe earlier mercury was still common mercury,\nUnfit to nourish the immortal embryo.\n\nWhen lead and mercury merge in the brain’s marrow,\nThe coarse essence and qi of the body\nCombine and transform—\nNo longer lead, nor mercury,\nBut a cool, serene, and tranquil taste,\nSweet as dew, fragrant as nectar,\nNot the crude, turbid essence of before—\nThis is what the ancients called *\"monk’s milk poured upon the crown.\"*\n\nIt descends from the upper palate,\nSwallowed and nurtured in the Yellow Court—\nSealed and perfected.\n\nWhen this true essence is born,\nThe body softens like silk,\nNeither fully asleep nor awake;\nThe restless mind and body now still,\nUnshaken, at peace—\nFirm in its place, secure in its dwelling—\nWhat peril could there be?\n\nThis state requires supreme stillness and clarity.\nAs for the method of gathering,\nIt is achieved by single-minded concentration,\nWithout the slightest distraction—\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"The unforced gathering surpasses forced gathering.\"*\n\nThe practitioner advances step by step,\nEach step bearing its own verification.\nIf there is no genuine foundation,\nThe work remains incomplete.\nWhen the celestial mechanism is fully revealed,\nOne must personally verify it.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing Others and Knowing Oneself**\n\nTo know others is wisdom,\nTo know oneself is enlightenment.\nTo overcome others is strength,\nTo overcome oneself is power.\n\nContentment brings wealth,\nDiligence brings resolve.\nTo remain steadfast is endurance,\nTo die yet not perish is longevity.\n\nThe Way of self-cultivation\nIs none other than nature and fate.\n\nIf one wishes to fulfill nature and establish fate,\nOne must first preserve the heart and nurture nature,\nSafeguard life and complete the form.\nThrough cultivation, refinement, accumulation, and repetition,\nOriginal nature expands,\nAnd fate rests within oneself.\n\nYet to fulfill the heart,\nOne must first know nature—\nTo grasp the essence of life,\nPure as heaven’s principle,\nUnmixed with human desires—\nThis is true wisdom.\n\nFrom this, one restrains desires and preserves principle,\nEver-mindful, ever-vigilant,\nEnsuring private desires are utterly purged,\nWhile heaven’s principle flows freely—\nPiercing the original face,\nAwake and unobstructed,\nEver-clear and luminous—\nThis is the perfect enlightenment.\n\nThis is not mere imagination—\nIt is self-knowing, beyond others’ comprehension.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"To know others is wisdom,*\n*To know oneself is enlightenment.\"*\n\nIf one seeks to establish one’s fate,\nFirst, one must refine oneself.\nRefinement of the self has two aspects:\nOne is **material desire**—\nIf material desire is not purged,\nHeaven’s true nature cannot manifest.\nTo abandon this and yet seek elixirs to forge the *dan*,\nIs like fine grain mixed with weeds and millet—\nUnless the weeds are first uprooted,\nBoth good and bad will grow together.\nUnless one first overcomes human desires,\nMaintaining steadfastness and vigilance,\nThere will be resolve, but not necessarily power.\nThus it is said:\n*\"To conquer others is to have strength.\"*\n\nThe second is **constitutional qi**—\nIf one’s qi and nature are not transformed,\nHow can the body be made firm?\nThus, one strips away the skin to preserve the fluids,\nStrips away the fluids to preserve the spirit,\nStrips away the spirit to return to emptiness—\nLayer by layer, stripped bare,\nOnly then can one align with the Dao and attain truth.\nIf not for a strong constitution and robust qi,\nHow could one overcome the six evils and subdue the myriad yin forces,\nMaking the body within and without as pure as jade,\nTransforming the mortal form into an immortal body?\nThus it is said:\n*\"To conquer oneself is to be strong.\"*\n\nWhen refinement of the self is complete,\nOne’s fate is established—\nIs the work not fulfilled here?\nIs the Dao not achieved here?\n\nYet, kindling fire has its time,\nExtinguishing fire has its moment—\nIf, when the fire is at its peak,\nOne does not practice extinguishing it,\nThe essence will follow the movement of the qi and dissipate.\nThus, stopping to nourish the *dan* is like a poor man accumulating wealth—\nOne always feels abundant.\nHaving mastered extinguishing the fire,\nOne must further advance the fire to nourish the *dan*,\nRetreat the fire to warm the *dan*.\nUnless one is resolute,\nOne cannot maintain an unbroken, seamless breath like this.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Heaven’s movement is vigorous—\nThe noble one strengthens themselves without ceasing.\"*\n\nIs this not the resolve of the strong and determined?\n\nAfter this stage of tempering and nourishment,\nOne need only rest the mind and spirit,\nLetting nature take its course,\nNever losing one’s footing for a single moment.\n\nAs Master Zisi said:\n*\"The utmost sincerity knows no pause—\nWithout pause, it endures.\"*\n\nYet when the common body is transformed and the true spirit ascends,\nIt is like the death of an ordinary man.\nFor the death of an ordinary man means the scattering of the spirit;\nBut the death of the Sage means the spirit remains whole—\nThough the form dies, the spirit lives on.\nHow could it not share in the longevity of Heaven and Earth?\n\nThis speaks of knowing the human path,\nConquering human desires—\nStill, it is but the pursuit of principle and the fulfillment of nature.\n\nOnly when nature is seen and the mind is illuminated,\nPiercing through to the original source,\nWith spirit strong and qi robust,\nAnd all impurities purged,\nCan one truly fulfill nature and establish fate.\n\nNature and fate are not two separate paths—\nThey return to the undifferentiated chaos before creation,\nWhere the yin-spirit is utterly extinguished\nAnd the yang-spirit is perfected.\n\nEven in the stages of refining essence into qi,\nAnd refining qi into spirit,\nThere remains the practice of extinguishing fire to nourish the *dan*.\nThe *Wuzhen* says:\n*\"If one clings to fullness without end,\nThey risk sudden disgrace and ruin.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nRefining essence into qi is the beginning of forming the embryo;\nRefining qi into spirit is the completion of forming the embryo.\nIf one does not know how to extinguish the fire,\nThe qi will not enter the embryo.\nThough essence is refined into qi,\nIt may still revert to essence through the movement of qi.\nAnd if one does not know how to extinguish the fire,\nThe spirit will not condense in the void—\nThough qi is refined into spirit,\nIt may still revert to qi through the movement of the spirit.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Knowing sufficiency is always sufficiency—\nA life free from disgrace.\"*\nThe words of the Supreme Sage are no deception.\n\nWhen the spirit returns to Great Stillness,\nThe qi follows into Great Stillness as well.\nA hundred years pass like a single day.\nA wandering thought means the *dan* is lost.\nSuch a heavy burden and distant path—\nOnly the strong and determined\nCan maintain their resolve\nAnd endure without weariness over time.\n\nWith the *sanmei* fire perfected,\nAscending to the heights above,\nThough dead, they live on—\nTheir spirit shares in the longevity of Heaven and Earth.\nThe entire process of the Golden Elixir is fulfilled here.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Unassuming Sage**\n\nThe Dao is vast and boundless,\nYet cannot be confined to left or right.\nAll things rely on it to live,\nYet it does not claim ownership of its deeds.\nIt clothes all things without ruling them.\nTo always lack desire is to be called \"small.\"\n\nAll things return to it without it claiming mastery—\nThis is to be called \"great.\"\nThus, the Sage never considers themselves great,\nAnd so they achieve true greatness.\n\nThe Dao is a boundless, unfathomable depth.\nIts vastness knows no shore.\nThe *Shijing* says:\n*\"Left, left—this is the Lord’s proper way;\nRight, right—this is what the noble one possesses.\"*\nFrom this, one sees how the Dao adapts to each moment,\nFulfilling all without fail,\nNourishing all without measure.\n\nWhat is this Dao?\nIt is the origin of all things’ generation.\nThe Dao exists in Heaven and Earth,\nAnd all things draw from it to live,\nYet it does not reject their chaos.\nBecause the Dao lacks nothing,\nAll things flourish without obstruction.\n\nThough the path of nurturing life is sufficient,\nAnd things rely on it to complete their being,\nIt is as if they generate and fulfill themselves—\nThe Dao does not appear to act,\nYet how could its achievements be otherwise?\n\nThough it is not named as having form,\nYet Heaven and Earth are vast,\nAnd the four seas stretch far—\nNo person escapes its embrace,\nNo thing avoids its coverage.\nLet all things generate and nurture themselves,\nYet the Dao seems unaware of birth or growth.\nIt universally protects all,\nEncompassing everything—\nTruly, *\"it clothes all things without claiming to give life.\"*\n\nWhen the Dao’s work is complete,\nIts grandeur is boundless and nameless.\nTo always lack desire is to always be pure and clear—\nThe eternal Dao.\n\nWhen viewed as small, it is named so,\nYet not even a blade of grass or tree is excluded;\nIt encompasses all things without flaw,\nA seamless unity where all dust is transformed.\nThis is the meaning of *\"small beyond breaking.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"To always lack desire is to be called 'small.'\"*\n\nWhen viewed as great, it spreads across Heaven and Earth,\nNurturing all life;\nSpanning ancient and present,\nContaining all things—\nYet nothing is excluded, no one left out.\nThis is the meaning of *\"great beyond bearing.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"All things return to it without it claiming mastery—\nThis is to be called 'great.'\"*\n\nHow profound and hidden is the Sage’s Dao!\nThe Sage aligns with the True Dao—\nAt rest, they guard the One and embrace the Center,\nMerging with the tranquil Heaven.\nIn action, they follow things and adapt to circumstances,\nEmbodying the forms of timely conduct.\n\nOnly Heaven is great,\nAnd only the Sage follows its example.\nThe Sage’s greatness is truly equal to Heaven’s.\nYet the Sage never considers themselves great—\nOnly by not considering themselves great\nCan they achieve true greatness.\nThis is why they are called the Great Sage.\n\nThis speaks of the Dao’s vastness—\nGenerating all things with abundance,\nClothing all things with sufficiency.\nWhether small or great, all is contained within.\nThe Sage achieves greatness\nBecause their cultivation has true roots.\n\nNow, the specific methods are detailed:\nWhen seated in meditation,\nFirst, concentrate the spirit,\nThen regulate the breath.\nWhen the spirit is fully concentrated—\nThere is no need for浩然正气 of utmost vigor and rigidity,\nFilling Heaven and Earth;\nOnly that the mind is free of agitation,\nThe will untethered,\nFeeling the heart as an empty vessel,\nNot possessing even a thought.\nThe mind, like ice melting,\nGenerates no trace of awareness—\nThe body stands firm,\nAs steadfast as a mountain,\nUnshaken, unmoved.\nThus, the spiritual light descends to illuminate the *qixue*,\nSilently observing as the yin-*zhiqi* and the *gonggong* qi converge\nWithin the *danting*.\n\nWith gentle warmth, I refine the spirit-fire,\nSlowly simmering the elixir,\nAs a faint zephyr softly breathes,\nGently fanning the flames—\nNaturally, the essence melts and the qi transforms.\nThis is the refining of essence into qi.\n\nHow do we know it is the refining of essence into qi?\nBefore this, the external qi was not gathered,\nAnd my inner spirit, unpaired,\nExisted separately—\nThe *kan* and *li* energies remained distinct,\nUnconnected, their breaths uncoordinated.\nWhen the external qi is drawn inward\nTo govern the inner yin-essence,\nThe essence transforms at the qi’s arrival.\nThe upper *xīn* and lower *shèn* energies merge as one,\nAnd the *gōnggōng* chamber rests in ease,\nThe *shènfǔ* in freedom.\nThe external breath and the inner true breath\nMerge into a single qi,\nLike husband and wife in union—\nGathered yet never dispersing.\nDay fills, month swells,\nAnd the true yang now manifests in form.\nThis is the clear sign of qi transformation.\n\nOnce the qi is refined,\nThe work ascends further.\nWhat is meant by ascending?\nAt this stage, breath and spirit merge,\nQi and essence intertwine,\nCongealing in the *dāntián*,\nTwisting and flowing like a living dragon swimming—\nEndless transformations in a single day.\nI only concentrate the spirit within,\nDirect the breath without,\nAnd let it unfold naturally—\nNaturally, stillness gives way to motion,\nMotion returns to stillness.\nThis is the refining of qi into spirit.\n\nWhen stillness endures long,\nMy qi grows harmonized,\nAnd what once swirled in the *dāntián*\nIs now fully refined—\nSeemingly present, yet absent,\nMoving yet still.\nThe essence is imperceptible,\nBut upon close examination, it is known.\nAt this moment, all knowing and awareness must be extinguished,\nAll thoughts erased, all emptiness dissolved—\nEven the converging spirit-qi of the *dāntián*\nIs left to stir and adjust itself,\nTo warm and temper on its own.\nI only maintain emptiness and quietude,\nPurely yielding to nature—\nThe spirit enters the qi unknowingly,\nThe qi envelops the spirit unperceived.\nAfter such a cycle of refining,\nA fragrant breeze naturally arises,\nRising through the hundred channels,\nPerfuming the entire body.\nThis is called *shēngshén*—spirit generating qi.\n\nAgain, the spirit grows ever refined,\nWisdom ever expanding.\nWithin the single mind,\nOnly a breath arises from the *guī* channel—\nPure, subtle, and luminous as jade.\nThis is called *qìshēngshén*—qi generating spirit.\n\nThus, spirit and qi nourish each other,\nMutually engendering.\nNow is the time to let go completely—\nNeither clinging nor detaching,\nAs if with intent, yet without purpose.\nThis is the true practice of refining spirit back to emptiness.\n\nThese three stages of practice—\nRefining essence, qi, and spirit—\nCan be achieved simultaneously.\nThe practitioner must follow the Dao,\nNot stopping at mere crude merging of spirit and qi,\nBefore attaining great stillness,\nNor abandoning the seat when spirit and qi blend into indistinction,\nBefore reaching the realm of effortless, pure, and natural ease.\nOne must persist in this path,\nFrom refining essence onward,\nUntil qi grows long and spirit thrives,\nTransforming into pure, natural clarity.\nThen, applying the *guīlú* method,\nOnly then does one align with Heaven and Earth’s filling and emptying,\nWith the seasons’ spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\nThus, the practice is complete in a full cycle.\n\nWhen practiced thus,\nMy qi grows ever harmonized,\nMy spirit ever still,\nWithin me, infinite transformations,\nEndless vitality.\nDay and night, the work continues—\nUninterrupted, meticulous—\nYin and yang in perfect balance,\nTrue qi naturally perfuming,\nAscending to the *níwán*,\nDescending to the *dānfǔ*,\nPenetrating the hundred channels,\nPiercing the flesh—\nA surging force that cannot be restrained.\nThis is the path of the *Héchē*—\nNaturally open, requiring only slight guidance.\nNot like the false paths of others,\nWhere one forces their own empty intentions,\nDeadly and rigid in their movements,\nIgnoring the natural rise and fall of stillness and motion.\n\nWith time, the elixir forms, the Dao is realized—\nWalking through mist, flying through air,\nConsorting with Heaven.\nThe Sage achieves greatness—\nTruly not a light matter.\n\n---\n**Chapter 35: Going Without Harm**\n\nHold the Great Symbol,\nAnd all under Heaven will come.\nGo without harm,\nAnd peace and ease prevail.\nMusic and bait may halt the passing traveler,\nBut the Dao, once spoken,\nIs bland, without taste.\nIt cannot be seen,\nCannot be heard,\nCannot be exhausted in use.\nWhat is this Great Symbol?\nIt is the Dao that generates Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things.\nBecause it encompasses all,\nIt is called the Great Symbol.\nWhat symbol is this?\nIt is the boundless, the limitless.\nYet without a symbol, what can be held?\nAnd without holding, what is there to grasp?\nThis does not contradict the Dao.\n\nIf one can always hold it, always preserve it,\nWithout forgetting or forcing,\nThen the Great Symbol is held,\nAnd the Great Dao is present.\n\nConfucius once told Yan Yuan:\n*\"One day of self-discipline and returning to ritual,\nAnd all under Heaven will return to virtue.\"*\nThus, the Dao’s fulfillment\nIs the fulfillment of all under Heaven.\nWhether returning to the Dao or to virtue,\nAll is done with sincere and willing hearts—\nWhat harm could there be?\n\nI know that one qi flows continuously,\nAnd all things transform in silence.\nFlooding and draining,\nAbove and below in perfect harmony\nWithin the vast movement of Heaven.\nThis is the natural order,\nNot something achieved in an instant.\nIf one merely adorns the senses for a moment,\nIt will still flow ceaselessly.\nBut like refined music that lingers in the heart,\nOr bait that delights the palate—\nSuch things may make the traveler pause,\nLinger, and forget their journey,\nYet they can only be enjoyed temporarily,\nNot sustained.\n\nOnly the Dao is without taste—\nNot rich, not sweet, not savory—\nYet it does not leave the palate unsatisfied,\nNor the heart unpleased.\nThis is the supreme flavor within the tasteless,\nBeyond the world’s indulgent flavors.\n\n---\n\nAlthough the Dao has no fixed place nor form,\nIt is difficult to imagine, difficult to grasp.\nThus it is said:\n*\"See it not, hear it not—*\nYet take from it without end,\nUse it without depletion,\nSuch is its nature.\n\nIt truly encompasses Heaven and Earth without excess,\nShapes all things without omission—\nThis is why the Dao is called great.\n\nLet scholars know what to aspire to!\n\nThis speaks of how mortals must emulate the interplay of Heaven and Earth,\nOnly then will the ebb and flow be harmonized,\nAs when refined music stirs the soul,\nOr fragrant bait delights the senses—\nSuch wonders evoke sighs of admiration.\n\nYet its realm is not easily attained.\n\nIf one’s passions are fierce and vitality wanes,\nWithout first descending from the extreme of motion,\nGradually reaching the realm of stillness,\nThen the mortal mind does not die,\nNor does the Dao-mind arise.\nThe common breath never ceases,\nWhile the true breath is unseen.\n\nOnly at the juncture where motion reaches its peak and stillness emerges,\nMust one not intervene with true intent to govern it.\nThis intent is yin—\nIt belongs to the self as *jǐ tǔ* [1].\nSoon, it becomes vague and indistinct,\nAs yin and yang mingle in embrace,\nEntering the boundless void—\nNeither dream nor waking,\nNeither sleep nor awareness.\nWithin this settled stillness,\nA sudden thread of warmth arises,\nMingling and continuous,\nQi flowing freely, spirit harmonized,\nThe two meeting faintly in the *Huángfáng* [2]—\nOn the verge of separation yet already parting,\nParting yet suddenly unified.\nThis is the manifestation of *true lead* [3].\n\nThe heart’s blossoms burst forth,\nWarmth permeates the body,\nThe primordial spirit leaps—\nNot forced by sensation,\nBut naturally arising.\nThus the signs of the Mysterious Pass appear,\nAnd the foundation of the Great Polarity is laid.\n\nAt this moment, only a single point of true heart,\nEmits true intent to gather and contain it.\nThis intent is yang—\nIt belongs to the self as *wù tǔ* [4].\nIn essence, it is one intent,\nYet merely the division of motion and stillness\nInto the two *tǔ* [5] of *wù* and *jǐ*.\n\nFor when the Mysterious Mother remains unopened,\nWithin the chaos of the undifferentiated,\nThis true intent, the master of desirelessness,\nIs called *yin tǔ* [6].\nBut once the Mysterious Mother opens\nAnd the true mechanism appears,\nThen one observes desire\nAnd penetrates its depths—\nCalled *yang tǔ* [7].\n\nOne is the nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nOne is the named mother of all things.\nTo generate Heaven, Earth, man, and all beings,\nIt is this single point of true intent\nThat flows through them all.\n\nThose who practice must wield this true intent to govern their transformations,\nOr else they will be swayed by sensation and stray in thought,\nOr driven by movement and lose their focus.\n\n*\"The Celestial Pass is controlled by me,\nThe Earthly Axis by my heart;\nThe cosmos resides within the body,\nAll transformations spring from the mind—*\nAll are directed by this moment’s luminous awareness,\nWhich governs and sustains them.\n\nThus it is said:\n*If one breath is too early,*\nThen the true mechanism has not yet emerged—\nHarvesting it yields no benefit.\n*If one breath is too late,*\nThen common thoughts have already arisen—\nHarvesting it brings only confusion,\nUnfit as medicine for refining the vital essence.\n\nThis requires great wisdom and great strength,\nOnly then can one discern it clearly\nAnd grasp it firmly\nAs the foundation for attaining transcendence and sainthood.\n\nThough this Mysterious Pass begins with gentle, delicate qi,\nOnly a faint warmth felt rising from the lower *yuán* [8],\nOver time it surges through the body,\nAs if unstoppable in its momentum.\nThe student must recognize it at its subtlest stage,\nWielding true intent to guide it—\nNot the slightest dispersion allowed.\nWith time, the qi-mechanism grows mighty,\nUnrestrained yet steady—\nFollowing its course without interference,\nNeither clinging to nor resisting its flow—\nThus one attains it.\n\nWhen the qi-mechanism is robust and flourishing,\nStillness alone summons the Celestial Mechanism’s movement,\nSwift as thunder—\nEven in the midst of all clamor,\nIt cannot be restrained.\nOne must have a heart of luminous awareness\nTo govern it,\nOr else there will be no distinction.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The State’s Sharpest Tools**\nIf one seeks to *conceal* them,\nFirst, they must be *fully displayed*.\nIf one seeks to *weaken* them,\nFirst, they must be *fully fortified*.\nIf one seeks to *abolish* them,\nFirst, they must be *fully flourished*.\nIf one seeks to *seize* them,\nFirst, they must be *fully granted*.\nThis is called *subtle clarity*.\n\nSoftness overcomes hardness,\nWeakness overcomes strength.\nFish cannot be pulled from the depths.\n\nThe state’s sharpest tools\nMust not be revealed to the people.\n\nHeaven has its fullness and emptiness, its waxing and waning,\nMan has his longevity and brevity, his poverty and abundance—\nThis too is the constant flow of *qi-numbers*.\n\nYet it applies only to the common mortal,\nNot to the sage.\nThe sage possesses the power to *reverse* Heaven and Earth,\nThe virtue to *turn* the Great Polarity—\nNo more than overturning yin and yang,\nAnd acting contrary to the workings of *造化* [9].\n\nJust as autumn arrives,\nAll things withdraw inward,\nYet what is sought is concealed and hard to gather—\nThe sage then *fortifies* the movement of Heaven and Earth’s qi,\n*Strengthens* the vitality of blood and breath.\n\nWhen winter comes,\nAll things decay,\nYet what is sought is withered and hard to revive—\nThe sage then *reignites* the qi’s manifestations,\nAnd *grants* the years as his own.\n\nThis is *both subtle and clear*,\n*Both constant and extraordinary*—\nUnfathomable to those who are not sages.\n\nTo shift from peril to safety,\nFrom chaos to order,\nOnly the divine and courageous can attain this transformation.\n\nYet in truth, their method is but *softness* and *weakness*.\nOnly because of their softness can they overcome hardness,\nOnly because of their weakness can they overcome strength.\n\nWhat is their means?\n*\"Man without essence perishes,\nFish without water dies—*\nOnce pulled from the depths,\nThe water dries and life’s mechanism vanishes.\n\nSimilarly, man’s *yuánzhēn* [10]—\nHis single essence—\nIs but a fragile remnant.\nMan and fish share the same reliance on water,\nYet it is not the dew of Heaven,\nBut the *Dao-creating* depths,\nThe water of the *One Primordial*.\n\nIt flows ceaselessly,\nFrequently nourishing all things.\n\nZhuangzi once said:\n*\"They moisten each other with dew,\nThey breathe upon each other with mist—*\nYet it is better to *forget each other in the rivers and lakes*.\" [11]\nLater generations strayed into false paths,\nTaking the *shaped* and *substantial* essence\nAs the foundation for refining longevity—\nThey failed to grasp the Dao as *thing*,\n*Strong yet moderate, pure yet complete*,\nArising from *vague indistinctness, boundless void, and natural emptiness*.\"\n\nThe secrets of alchemical fire and the refined essence of culinary arts are not imparted to the unworthy—only to the saintly master, the utterly sincere, or those who have rendered merit and virtue, who seek the Way with an empty heart and earnestly pursue a teacher. Few are those who can naturally align with the Dao’s favor.\n\nFor the mysteries of Heaven are profound and secret, the weight of Heaven and Earth is supreme, and even the spirits revere them. To recklessly transmit these truths to the unworthy invites calamity upon the Nine Ancestors. It is like the state’s most precious instruments—never to be revealed lightly. Thus, the virtuous man keeps them guarded and concealed. Do the scholars understand this?\n\nThis speaks of those who cultivate the Dao, truly wielding the cosmos in their grasp and nurturing all transformations in their hearts. Yet it is enough to observe the Way of Heaven, to hold fast to its operations, to follow it and take from it, to oppose it and apply it.\n\nIt is not a matter of harboring life’s vitality within the mechanism of destruction—what is called the overwhelming darkness of ultimate Yin, the austere brilliance of ultimate Yang. The overwhelming emerges from Heaven, the austere from Earth. To draw ultimate Yang from ultimate Yin—that is the source of opportunity.\n\nIf one can take the Yang from the black mountain’s cavern, or seize the treasure from the demon’s lair, then one has stolen life’s vitality from within the mechanism of destruction. Yet all this is drawn from the void of Heaven and Earth, seized from the emptiness and stillness of the human form—this is the true essence, not the common essence of the world.\n\nIf one can steal it without losing the proper moment, applying it with a single effort, there will be a corresponding advancement. I urge the scholar to cultivate with gentleness and weakness, to establish virtue and merit, so as to earn the favor of the divine and receive the transmitted incantations of the immortals. Otherwise, even the greatest matters—those that shake Heaven and Earth and move the spirits—will rarely be transmitted, for the laws of Heaven are most strict and cannot be defied.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"If the Dao could be offered to others, then all would offer it to their lords.\nIf the Dao could be advanced to others, then all would advance it to their kin.\nIf the Dao could be given to others, then all would give it to their brothers.\nIf the Dao could be transmitted to others, then all would transmit it to their descendants.*\nYet none of these are possible—why? Because without inner virtue, the Dao cannot stand; without inner mastery, the Dao cannot move.\"\n\nWhen we examine the words of the sages together, we see that the state’s most precious instruments must not be revealed lightly. Later generations of cultivators must not treat the Great Dao as common property, imparting it indiscriminately to all, lest they invite Heaven’s retribution and have no recourse for regret.\n\nThis is the meaning of *public yet not public, not public yet public*—a subtlety beyond the grasp of the unenlightened. Let them take heed.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao’s Constant Non-Action**\n\nThe Dao constantly does nothing yet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it, all things would transform of their own accord.\nWhen transformation stirs to act, I shall restrain it with the nameless Primordial Simplicity.\nThe nameless Primordial Simplicity—it too shall not desire.\nThrough non-desire, stillness prevails, and the world will settle of its own accord.\n\nThough the Dao acts naturally without doing, to fixate on non-action alone becomes the doctrine of stubborn emptiness.\nOne must root oneself in non-action while employing action’s principles—\nnon-action within action, action yet still non-action—\nthus the essence stands firm and the Dao moves,\nthe Dao is complete and virtue is fulfilled.\n\nThis is the constant responsiveness and constant stillness,\nconstant tranquility and constant alertness—\nwhen released, it fills the six directions;\nwhen withdrawn, it hides in the central void.\nAt this moment of boundless indistinction, there is the certainty of seated illumination without omission.\nThough called non-action, action is contained within;\nthough called action, non-action encompasses it.\nThus the Great Dao resides within me, the Great Root ever abides.\n\nEven the most exalted lords and kings—\nif they lack this Dao as their foundation,\nall things become divided and difficult to transform.\nOnly by holding fast to this Dao\ncan the people and all things harmonize in nature and sentiment,\nin resonance and breath,\nnaturally transforming and subtly influencing one another,\nuntil the age of Great Peace takes form.\n\nYet in times of enduring tranquility, ancient ways grow difficult to uphold.\nThis is the inevitable course of human inclination and the fixed order of things—nothing strange in it.\n\nWhen creation becomes frequent and splendor arises, human hearts grow more treacherous, and calamities multiply.\nThis is the fate of Heaven and Earth’s cycles, beyond mortal escape.\nOnly the sage possesses the methods to preserve tranquility and sustain fullness,\nthe strategies for enduring peace and lasting governance.\n\nIn the early ages of culture’s dawn,\nwith non-action, non-doing, non-thought, non-care,\nin the undivided, nameless Primordial Simplicity,\nthey cultivated it within themselves and applied it to others,\nguiding those before and leading those behind,\npurely in accord with Heaven, untainted by human contrivance—\nthus they stabilized the court within and the realm without.\n\nThe first line of *Layered Array*: *\"The sun lingers, beneficial to reside in the true\"*—\nthis is the first stabilization for those in the age of primordial darkness.\nFor even stones conceal jade and mountains gleam,\nwhile waters cradle pearls and rivers enchant.\nIf the Primordial Simplicity itself can exert such influence,\nhow much more so the nameless Primordial Simplicity?\nTo unite all people and things under its governance?\n\nIf it is not returned to its original unity and purity,\nit will never bring the extremes to their proper convergence,\nnor ensure all attain the ease of the ancestral hall.\n\nOnly by being unaware and unknowing,\nby following the Will of the Emperor,\nby forgetting virtue and morality,\nby not recognizing the harmony of Heaven and humanity—\nonly then does one attain this.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The nameless Primordial Simplicity—it too shall not desire.\nThrough non-desire, stillness prevails,\nand the world will settle of its own accord.\"*\nThis is the tranquil simplicity of effortless governance,\nwhere the ruler does not know what to do to transform,\nand the people do not know what to do to respond—\nruler and subjects both rest in the Dao of non-action,\nacting without knowing why, yet acting perfectly.\n\nThus Shun governed through non-action,\nand alone endured through the ages.\n\nFor those who rule over the people,\ncan they not take non-action as their foundation?\n\nThis discourse on governing the world\nfinds its root in non-action.\nThe way of cultivating oneself\nis no different.\n\nYet one hears of the **Dharma/正法**—is it not more sublime than this?\n\nIf one does not cultivate it here,\nthen one’s **spirit/精神** shall surely be depleted,\nand life’s span shall be hard to prolong.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, **qi/氣息** fades away,\nand one knows not whether one becomes a ghost or a **蜮** (spectral spirit),\nor a beast or a bird.\n\nThrough the cycles of the **Six Paths/六道**,\none turns endlessly—when shall one escape?\n\nNow, the **Dharma/法筳** is widely proclaimed,\nthe **Great Dao/大道** expansively opened—\nhow can one not hasten cultivation,\nlest time slip by in vain?\n\nAll things, compared to the human body’s\nfive senses and hundred limbs,\n**spirit/精神** and **vital essence/血氣**—\nif one can uphold the constant **Dao/Way of non-action/無為常道**,\nthen all cares shall cease of their own accord,\nand the hundred bones shall all be in order.\nThe skin shall be moist and supple,\nthe hair bright and lustrous—\nnot unlike the **Golden Form/金相** and **Jade Nature/玉質**.\n\nIf **noble lords/侯王** can uphold it,\nthen all things shall transform naturally—\nlike the **inner light/一心內照**,\ntheir changes become attuned and responsive.\n\nYet the **fire/火** is not yet refined,\nand the **substance/氣質** remains impure.\n\nAt this moment, **spirit/精神** is greatly harmonized,\nand **wisdom/智慧** frequently arises—\nsome delight in discussing the past and future,\nto display their talents;\nothers take pleasure in speaking of great deeds and worldly achievements,\nto boast before others.\n\nAll such actions stem from\nthe **impurity of virtue/power/道德未純**.\n\nThe elixir of jade nectar now perfected,\nonce more the furnace and cauldron are set in order,\nthe heavens and earth are reborn anew—\nyet still the **Nameless Primordial/無名太朴** is poured\ninto the **Eight Trigrams Furnace/八卦炉**,\nwithin by **Heaven’s Natural Divine Fire/天然神火**,\nwithout by the **ordinary furnace of adjustment/增減凡炉**,\nas time and fire refine—\neven the **Nameless Primordial** is utterly forgotten.\n\nWhen **ignorance and desire are absent/無知無欲**,\nand tranquility and simplicity reign—\nthen the mortal form transforms,\nreturning naturally to the **Primordial Qi/先天一氣**,\nand the **Dao of Transcendence/仙道** is fulfilled.\n\nAs it is said:\n*\"To desire nothing is to remain still—\nthen the world shall naturally align itself.\"*\n\nThis is the **Supreme Way/太上** of governing the world and cultivating the self—\nits single thread that binds all else.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Virtue of the Supreme Virtue/上德不德**\n\nThe **Supreme Virtue/上德** does not cling to virtue,\nand thus virtue arises.\nThe **Lower Virtue/下德** clings to virtue,\nand thus virtue is lost.\n\nThe **Supreme Virtue** acts without action,\nyet nothing is left undone.\nThe **Lower Virtue** acts with action,\nyet nothing is fully accomplished.\n\nThe **Supreme Benevolence** acts without contrivance,\nwhile the **Supreme Righteousness** acts with contrivance.\nThe **Supreme Propriety** acts with formality,\nyet when none respond,\nit forces itself—\narms bared, it seizes.\n\nThus, when the **Dao is lost**, virtue emerges;\nwhen **virtue is lost**, benevolence arises;\nwhen **benevolence is lost**, righteousness takes hold;\nwhen **righteousness is lost**, propriety is enforced.\n\nFor **propriety** is the thinnest veil of **loyalty and trust**,\nyet it is the **beginning of chaos**.\n\n**Preconceived notions** are the **ornaments of the Dao**,\nthe **first seeds of folly**.\n\nThus, the **true man** dwells in **substance, not ornament**,\nin **reality, not illusion**—\nand so he discards the latter for the former.\n\nIn the **ancient times**, the winds were vast and untrammled—\none surrendered to **Heaven’s course**,\nthe waters flowed deep and boundless—\neach found ease in their **true nature**.\nAbove and below acted without contrivance,\nrulers and people shared in joy.\n**Sincerity and thickness** became the custom,\nand disputes did not arise.\n\nHow pure was the **Dao** in those days!\nAll was due to resting in **Heaven’s effortless way**,\nfollowing **nature’s spontaneous flow**.\nEach aged in their **aging**, nurtured their **young**,\nhonored the **wise**, cherished their **kin**,\ntended fields with contentment, feasted on **virtue’s nourishment**,\nand drank from **harmony’s cup**—\nunaware of **virtue’s name**,\nlet alone the teachings of **benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom**.\n\nYet they embraced **primordial purity**,\nlet **qi’s movements** unfold naturally—\nand **Heaven and Earth** flowed in unison,\nas if untaught yet transformed,\neffortless yet accomplished,\nin perfect accord with **virtue and the Dao**,\nwith no conflict between **benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom**.\n\nWhen **virtue and the Dao** are spoken together,\nthe **Dao** is the **essence**, **virtue** the **function**.\nWhen **virtue, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom** are discussed as one,\nthen **virtue and the Dao** are again the **essence**,\nwhile the rest are **functions**.\n\nLater sages, though establishing these teachings\nto **civilize the people**,\nnamed **virtue and the Dao**,\nand divided them into **benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom**—\nyet in truth, **virtue and the Dao** contain them,\nand they in turn contain **virtue and the Dao**—\nno separation, no lack.\n\nBut in later ages, **virtue and the Dao** were divided.\nAnd further still, **benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom**\nbecame fixed in one-sided extremes—\nall due to the **shift of cosmic cycles** and the **deceit of human hearts**.\n\nThe **Supreme Way** wished to return all to their **roots**,\nto **reclaim their origin**,\nand so it sighed:\n*\"The man of **Supreme Virtue**, acting without contrivance,\ndoes not know virtue—\nand thus his virtue endures.\nThe man of **Lower Virtue**, knowing virtue’s worth,\nloves its name and practices it,\nfearing to lose it—\nand thus his virtue is ever in peril.\n\nHis thoughts scatter and his purity shatters—\nnot like the **Supreme Virtue’s** single, unbroken sincerity,\nwhere no trace of contrivance remains.\nFor through clinging to virtue,\nhe becomes **without virtue**.\"*\n\nMoreover, when the **Supreme Virtue** acts without action,\nthe world aligns in **effortless harmony**;\nwhen the **Lower Virtue** acts with action,\nthe age grows **ornate and divided**,\nand all delight in **artificial contrivance**.\n\nIs it not so?\nThe **carefree** still the world’s **machinations**,\nwhile the **ambitious** ignite them anew?\n\nYet when **times are exhausted**, they renew;\nwhen **things are exhausted**, they transform;\nwhen **men are exhausted**, they return.\n\nIn this **age of turmoil**,\nwhen customs grow **decadent** and **hearts unsteady**,\nthe **primordial purity** is long buried.\nThere must arise a **ruler who loves benevolence**,\nwho **clarifies the source**, **rectifies the root**,\nturning chaos to order,\ndanger to safety—\nthough forced to act,\nhe yet **adapts to the times**,\n**follows the natural course**,\nso that **action remains non-action**—\nthus, with **clothes of simplicity**, the world is governed.\n\nThen there are those who **love righteousness**,\nwho in times of **disorder** seek to restore **peace**,\nand with **zealous vigor** sweep away corruption—\nyet though they may **renew the world**,\ntheir **example spreads**,\nand the **struggle for dominance** among people and things\ncannot be stilled.\n\nAnd when the **rulers of propriety** arise,\nthe hearts of men grow yet more **corrupt**.\nThey **observe formalities**,\ndebate **reciprocity**,\nsometimes **giving much yet receiving little**,\nsometimes **granting favors only to meet grudges**—\nand thus they cannot rest in **true ease**.\n\nMorning brings **changes in governance**,\ncustoms shift between **loss and gain**—\nthey cannot **harmonize near and far**,\nand at the slightest **disagreement**,\narms are raised in **conflict**,\nwar drums sound—\nthey cannot **dwell together in peace**.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the **Dao is lost**, virtue arises;\nwhen **virtue is lost**, benevolence takes hold;\nwhen **benevolence is lost**, righteousness is enforced;\nwhen **righteousness is lost**, propriety is observed.\"*\n\nDown to this day,\nmen grow ever more **corrupt**,\naffairs ever more **entangled**,\nwhile **loyalty and trust** have **decayed beyond repair**—\nand so **propriety** is invoked to **preserve order**.\n\nYet alas—\nit is but **superficial adornment**,\nnot **sincere transformation from within**.\nDaily **interactions multiply**,\n**disputes swell**—\nthose who rely on **propriety** to **bind hearts**\nhave not considered:\n*What is observed externally must spring from within.*\nOtherwise, **disaster looms**,\nand **division deepens**—\nseeking **peace through conflict**,\nthey plunge into **greater peril**.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"**Loyalty and trust**, though thin,\nare the **root of chaos**.\"*\n\n*\"As for wisdom, it is not some extraordinary scheme or preemptive stratagem—it is the **Dao/Way** of **sincere discernment** (*chéng ér míng*), which comes without deliberation (*bù sī ér dé*), without study (*bù xué ér néng*), and naturally clear as a mirror. How could it be compared to the **deceitful and contrived** (*nì zhuā yì xìn*)?\n\nYet **the splendor of Dao/Way** is not **its true substance**. Moreover, **excessive scrutiny** (*chá chá wéi míng*) must inevitably lead to **empty fabrications and falsehoods** (*xū wū jià wěi*), without one’s awareness.\n\nEven if one **reflects upon oneself** (*zài jǐ*), one may **boast of special insight** (*jīng tè shí*), but in truth, this is the **beginning of folly** (*yú zhī shǐ*).\n\nThus, a **true man** (*dà zhàng fū*) with **true insight** (*zhēn shí*) and **resolute power** (*dìng lì*) knows that **sincerity and depth** (*dūn hòu*) are the **Dao/Way of propriety** (*lǐ*), so he **takes its substance** (*qǔ qí hòu*), not its **superficial veneer** (*qǔ qí báo*). Knowing that **the splendor of Dao/Way** is not **true wisdom** (*zhī qí huá fēi zhī huá*), he **takes its substance** (*qǔ qí shí*), not its **splendor** (*qǔ qí huá*).\n\n**Discarding and embracing** (*qù qǔ yōu yí*) are as they should be, and so the **Great Dao/Way** is not difficult to restore.\n\nThis shows that when **virtue/power** (*dào*) is lost, **benevolence** (*rén*) and **righteousness** (*yì*) arise; when **benevolence** and **righteousness** are lost, **propriety** (*lǐ*) and **wisdom** (*zhì*) emerge—ever descending, a result of **human hearts and customs** (*rén xīn fēng sú*), nothing strange about it.\n\nAs for **cultivation and nourishment** (*xiū yǎng*), **swallowing saliva and refining qi** (*yàn jīn fú qì*) brings forth a **transformation of the Dao/Way** (*dào yī biàn*); **gathering herbs and alchemizing elixirs** (*cǎi yào liàn dān*) brings forth another **transformation of the Dao/Way** (*dào yī biàn*). Down to this day, **erroneous teachings** (*fēn fēn zuǒ dào*) abound—beyond reckoning!\n\nWho truly understands that **the Mystic Pass** (*xuān guān*)—a single aperture—is the **essence of Dao/Way cultivation** (*xiū dào zhī yào wù*)?\n\nI now reveal it to people: To **perceive this Mystic Pass** (*rèn qí xuān guān*), one must first endure **great toil and labor** (*dà chén láo*), then **great rest and respite** (*dà xiū xiē*), before one can **penetrate its depths** (*liǎo chè*).\n\nIt is also said:\n*'When thoughts arise, that is the **illness** (*bìng*); when they are not prolonged, that is the **medicine** (*yào*).'*\n*'Lay down the butcher’s cleaver, and instantly become a **Buddha** (*fó*).'*\n\nAll this amounts to nothing more than **dusty emotions and fleeting thoughts** (*chén qíng zá niàn*), swirling and chaotic—when one **awakens within them** (*cóng zhōng yī jué*), that is the **Mystic Pass** (*xuān guān*), the **so-called 'returning to the shore'** (*huí tóu shì àn*).\n\nIt is also said:\n*'The **far shore** (*bǐ àn*) is not distant—**the radiant light of enlightenment** (*huí guāng fǎn zhào*) is itself the **shore**.'*\n\nBut fear arises when, before the **Mystic Pass** is opened (*xuān guān wèi kāi*), one **prematurely imposes contrivance** (*xiān jiā yī fān yì sī qù sūn duó*); or when, after the **Mystic Pass** is opened (*xuān guān jì kāi*), one **adds further fixation** (*yòu jiā yī fān yì sī qù shǒu hù*).\n\nSuch **proliferating thoughts** (*niàn lǜ fēn chéng*) are like **heaven’s original clouds and veils** (*yīn tiān běn wú yún yì*)—when they disperse, the **vast and wondrous landscape of clarity** (*tài kōng miào jǐng*) reveals itself. Yet if one **again imposes smoke and dust** (*zhuǎn lìng qīng míng guǎng dà zhī tiān yīn qí yān chén*), the **clear and boundless heaven** (*qīng míng guǎng dà zhī tiān*) will be **narrowed and constricted** (*yīn qí yān chén*), its **luminosity obscured** (*zhuǎn lìng qīng míng guǎng dà zhī tiān yīn qí yān chén*), and its **darkness unrecognizable** (*hūn àn mò biàn*).\n\nThe **Buddha** said:\n*'One must **abide thus** (*yìng rú shì zhù*), **subduing the heart** (*xiàng fú qí xīn*) in this way.'*\n\nSuch **profound mechanisms** (*xuān jī*) cannot be **approximated by a single word** (*zǒng shī bù dé yī háo nǐ yì*), for approximation is **not true**. Nor can they be **grasped by half a thought** (*zhuó bù dé bàn diǎn sī lǜ*), for thought is **misguided**.\n\nOnly when the **Mystic Pass** is **not yet opened** (*xuān guān wèi kāi*), do I **follow its natural illumination** (*shùn qí liǎo zhào zhī yì*). When the **Mystic Pass** is **already opened** (*xuān guān jì kāi hòu*), I **rest in its effortless clarity** (*ān qí zuò zhào zhī hún*).\n\nIf **thoughts scatter wildly** (*niàn ruò fēn chéng*), I **withdraw them** (*jī shōu huí*), and **withdrawal itself is the way** (*shōu huí jì shì*). If the **spirit is dim and obscured** (*shén rú hūn wǎng*), I **reorder it** (*zhěng dùn*), and **reordering itself is the way** (*zhěng dùn jì shì*).\n\nHow **simple and effortless** (*rú hé jiǎn jiě biàn yì*) is this?\n\nYet some **fix their minds on the bed while seeking repose** (*rèn qí chén shàng ān chén*), or **search for movement within stillness** (*dòng zhōng xún dòng*), or **seek stillness within motion** (*jìng lǐ qiú jìng*), thereby **falling into contrived analysis** (*qiú yú chuān záo*).\n\nWhile the **Mystic Pass** lies **plainly before them** (*xuān guān fēn míng zài qián*), they **fail to recognize it due to later-day knowledge and speculation** (*yīn hòu tiān zhī lǜ zhē bì ér bù zài yǐ*).\n\nI now reveal a **key principle** (*yào jué*): Let **thoughts swirl chaotically** (*rèn tā sī niàn fēn fēn mò kě liǎo què*), yet I **awaken within them** (*néng yī jué ér dòng biàn jiù sǎo chú*), and this **awakening is the Mystic Pass** (*zhì jì shì xuān guān*).\n\nIt is clear that **one’s Dao/Way cultivation** (*rén zhī xiū liàn*) depends solely on this **awakened and luminous mind** (*jué zhào zhī xīn*), which must always **shine forth like the sun in an empty sky** (*cháng xū guāng míng dòng zhào*), **untainted by even a speck of darkness** (*yī háo hūn hēi bù dé*). If **darkness creeps in** (*hūn hēi jì luò wū àn dì yù*), one **falls into defilement** (*luò wū àn dì yù*).\n\nIf one **can disperse the clouds and mists** (*néng bō kāi yún wù*), then **blue sky and white sun** (*qīng tiān bái rì*) lie **brightly before** (*míng míng zài qián*).\n\nYet if **thoughts of the world arise** (*rú shēng tā xiǎng*), one **falls into the ordinary man’s rut** (*luò fán fū wō jiù*), not the **foundation of the Immortal** (*fēi shén jiān běn*).\n\nIn summary, the **Immortal’s teachings** (*xiān jiā wú tā miào jué*) have no other **secret** (*miào jué*), only **illuminating the heart and seeing true nature** (*míng xīn jiàn xìng*), which is the **essence of cultivation** (*xiū liàn yào zhǐ*).\n\nIf one asks: *What is **elixir** (*dān*)?*\nIt is the **original qi** (*yuán qì*) within my **elixir field** (*dān zhōng*), the **primordial essence** (*yuán xìng*).\n\nYet this **original qi** (*yuán qì*) is **indivisible from my innate spirit** (*yuán shén*), both **uniting as one** (*huì hé yī chù*), which is the **single point of Heavenly Fate** (*tiān mìng*) before **the return to the Ultimate Supreme** (*fǎn huán tàijí wújí*), when **parents had not yet given birth** (*fù mǔ wèi shēng qián*).\n\nIf one **can establish life through true nature** (*néng yǐ xìng lì mìng*) and **fulfill true nature through Heavenly Fate** (*yǐ mìng liǎo xìng*), then **eternal life without death** (*cháng shēng bù sǐ*) is achieved.\n\nBut if one **seeks alchemy in the Water Realm** (*shuǐ fǔ qiú xuān*), desiring to **cultivate the Golden Elixir** (*chéng jīn yè zhī dān*), yet **lacks the innate breath of the Primordial Spirit** (*bù dé xiān tiān shén xī*), and **harvests, refines, and tempers** (*cǎi qìng pēng liàn*) without **mastering the natural ascent and descent** (*jìn tuì wēn yǎng*)—then the **Primordial Nature** (*xiān tiān yuán xìng*) and the **Primordial Fate** (*xiān tiān yuán mìng*) **cannot spontaneously unite** (*bù néng zǎn wǔ cù liù wéi chéng jīn dān*).\n\nThough this is so, once **Primordial Nature** and **Primordial Fate** are attained (*jì dé yuán xìng yuán mìng yǐ*), if one **lacks true and genuine breath** (*yòu wú zhēn zhèng pēi xī*), it is like **a man and woman in the world who cannot find a matchmaker** (*róng rén shì nán nǚ bù dé méi bǐ*), though they **come and go in intercourse** (*wǎng lái jiāo tōng*), they **cannot form a conjugal bond** (*yì néng jié wéi fū fù*).\n\nThus the **elixir scriptures** (*dān jīng*) say:\n*'**True intent** (*zhēn yì*) is the **matchmaker** (*méi bǐ*).'*\n\nNow it is also said:\n*'**True breath** (*zhēn xī*) is the **matchmaker** (*méi bǐ*).'*\nIs this not **contrary to the ancient scriptures** (*yǐ bù yú gǔ jīng xiāng bèi hū*)?\n\nThose who **do not know True Intent** (*bù zhī zhēn yì zhě liàn dān jiāo hé zhī shén*) are **deceived by the alchemical process** (*liàn dān jiāo hé zhī shén*); **True Breath** (*zhēn xī*) is the **instrument of alchemical union** (*liàn dān jiāo hé zhī qì*), but fundamentally, it is the **united essence of spirit and qi** (*yào zhī jié yǐ shén qì èr zhě hé wéi yī ér yǐ*).\n\nIf there is **no True Breath** (*dì wú zhēn xī*), then **True Qi** (*zhēn qì*) **cannot ascend and descend on its own** (*bù néng zì shēng zì jiàng*), nor **unite and temper itself** (*huì hé wēn yǎng*), nor **form the Mystic Pearl** (*jié chéng xuān zhū*).\n\nOnce **True Breath** is attained (*jì dé zhēn xī*), if one **lacks True Intent** (*yòu wú zhēn yì*) to **command, gather, and seal it strictly** (*hào lìng shè chí yán mì*), then **True Breath** **cannot come and go, advance and retreat** (*zhēn xī yì bù néng wǎng lái jìn tuì*), nor **remain effortlessly natural** (*rú rú zì rú*).\n\nThus it is said: **True Intent** is the **key to elixir cultivation** (*liàn dān zhī yào*).\n\nYet if **True Intent** **cannot unite with the Primordial Spirit** (*bù dé zhēn zhèng yuán shén*), then **from where does True Intent begin** (*zhēn yì cóng hé ér shǐ*)?\n\nOnly when the **Mystic Pass** is first opened (*xuān guān qiǎo kāi zhī chū*), does one **recognize this True Intent** (*rèn qǔ zhè diǎn zhēn yì*), and then **return to hold it fast** (*yú shì fǎn ér chí zhī*), as **Master Yan’s earnest devotion** (*xué yán zǐ quán quán fú yīng*), thus attaining it.\n\nMoreover, the **Primordial Spirit’s manifestations** (*yuán shén suǒ liù lù*) are **True Intent itself** (*zhēn yì*), **a single act of goodness** (*yī shàn*), and also the **Dao/Way of attaining one to fulfill all things** (*yī dé ér wàn shì bì zhī dào*).\n\nIf the **student recognizes this clearly** (*xué rén rèn qǔ fēn míng*), then the **foundation of the Great Elixir** (*dà dān zhī běn*) is established.\n\nAncient **Master Qiu** said:\n*'If the **breath** (*xī*) has even a **single speck of instability** (*yī háo wèi dìng*), then the **Fate** (*mìng*) is not **one’s own**.'*\n\nI reveal to the **student** (*xué rén*): To **seek eternal life** (*qiú cháng shēng*), one must first **subdue the breath** (*xiān xū fú qì*).\"\n\n「Yet, *subduing the breath* (*fú qì*) has two meanings: one is to suppress and store this *qi* within the **Central Palace** (*zhōng gōng*), remaining **still and unmoving** (*rú rú bù dòng*); the second is to **strictly regulate and govern** (*guǎn shì yán mì*) it, for within this *subduing of the breath* (*fú qì*) lies the **Dao/Way of attaining eternal life** (*cháng shēng*).\n\nBeyond these, there is no other path. **Practitioners** (*xiū xíng rén*) must follow this teaching diligently, lest they fail to honor my **one sincere intention** (*yī piàn kǔ zhōng*).\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Humble as the Foundation**\n\nThe ancients who **attained the One** (*dé yī*):\n\n- **Heaven** (*Tiān*) attains the One to be **clear** (*qīng*),\n- **Earth** (*Dì*) attains the One to be **settled** (*níng*),\n- **Spirit** (*shén*) attains the One to be **responsive** (*líng*),\n- **Grain** (*gǔ*) attains the One to be **full** (*yíng*),\n- **All things** (*wàn wù*) attain the One to **generate** (*shēng*),\n- **Lords and kings** (*hóu wáng*) attain the One to **establish their sovereignty** (*wéi tiān xià zhēn*)—\n  such is the **result of attaining the One** (*qí zhì yī zhī*).\n\nWithout **clarity** (*qīng*), **Heaven** (*Tiān*) would fear **rupture** (*liè*);\nwithout **settlement** (*níng*), **Earth** (*Dì*) would fear **upheaval** (*fā*);\nwithout **responsiveness** (*líng*), **Spirit** (*shén*) would fear **extinction** (*xiē*);\nwithout **generation** (*shēng*), **All things** (*wàn wù*) would fear **annihilation** (*miè*);\nwithout **sovereignty** (*zhēn*), **Lords and kings** (*hóu wáng*) would fear their **prestige** (*guì gāo*) being **overthrown** (*jié*).\n\nThus, the **prestigious** (*guì*) relies on the **humble** (*jiàn*) as its **foundation** (*běn*),\nand the **elevated** (*gāo*) rests upon the **lowly** (*xià*) as its **base** (*jī*).\n\nHence, **Lords and kings** (*hóu wáng*) call themselves **lonely** (*gū*), **bereft** (*guǎ*), **unworthy** (*bù gū*—*unworthy of the title \"king\"*),\nfor this is their way of **holding the humble as foundation** (*yǐ jiàn wéi běn*), is it not?\n\nTherefore, **the One** (*yī*) is **sovereign** (*zhēn*) without a **chariot** (*chē*),\ndoes not desire **polished brilliance** (*tián tián rú yù*—*like jade, smooth and gleaming*) **or** **sterile rigidity** (*luò luò rú shí*—*like stone, cold and unyielding*).\n\nThe **Great Dao/Way** (*Dà Dào*) has no other secret—\n**the One** (*yī*) alone is its essence.\n\nWhat is this **One** (*yī*)?\n\nThe primordial **qi** (*yuanqi*) of **Hongmeng** before differentiation—\nthe **boundless** (*wújí*), **chaotic** (*hún*), and **formless** (*wúxíng*)—\ngave birth to the **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*), the source of all things.\n\nIn truth, the **primordial qi** (*yuanqi*) is shapeless—\nthis is called **Boundlessness** (*Wújí*).\nAll things arise from **Boundlessness** and take form—\nthis is the **root of the world**, called the **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*).\nThis is the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **Sage** (*shèngrén*), though nameless, names it—\nthus it is called **One** (*yī*).\nWithout the **One**, there are no things;\nwithout things, there is no **One**.\nTo possess it is to live;\nto lose it is to perish.\n\nSince the **Beginning of Origins** (*Yuánshǐ*), all that has taken form and manifested—\nendlessly flowing, eternally generating—\nfrom the vast **Great Cycle** (*Dà Zhōu*) to the minute **dust-mote** (*wēichén*), none escape it.\n\nAs the *Zhōngyōng* says:\n*\"It cannot be seen, cannot be heard,\nyet nothing can be omitted from its embrace.\"*\nWhat else could this be?\n\nThus, when all is considered:\nThe **Heaven’s** clarity comes from the **One**;\nthe **Earth’s** stability comes from the **One**;\nthe **Spirit’s** responsiveness comes from the **One**;\nthe **valley’s** fullness comes from the **One**;\nthe **birth of all things** comes from the **One**;\nthe **Lord’s** rectification of himself and the world\nis nothing but the **One’s** sovereign virtue.\n\nThough great and small differ in form,\nnoble and base diverge in path,\ncoarse and refined vary in substance,\ndark and bright in manifestation—\nwhether mortal or ghost—\nhow could anything transcend this **One** as its encompassing embrace?\n\nFor even **Heaven**, though most exalted,\nwithout the **One** would fear collapse;\nthe **Earth**, though most solid,\nwithout the **One** would fear upheaval;\nthe **Spirit**, though most subtle,\nwithout the **One** would fear stagnation;\nthe **echo in the valley**, though most resonant,\nwithout the **One** would fear exhaustion;\nall **things**, though most manifold,\nwithout the **One** would fear annihilation;\n**Lords and kings**, though most high and noble,\nwithout the **One** to rectify the world,\nwould fear that lofty rank brings peril,\nand exalted name brings ruin—\nhow then could the **One** be neglected?\n\nIf one follows the **One** and disperses into the ten thousand things—\nvast and boundless, profound and unfathomable—\nthen **Heaven, Earth, Spirit, and Valley**,\nall **things, and Lords and kings**,\nall rely on this **One** as their sovereign master,\nspanning the heavens and filling the earth,\nwithout gap or flaw, exhaustively complete—\nsuch is its extremity.\nThus, nothing is higher than the **Dao/Way**,\nnothing more noble than the **One**.\n\nYet from **non-being** to **being**, what is there to exalt?\nFrom **subtlety** to **manifestation**, what is there to prize?\nEven if nobility surpasses the **Capital** (*Jīng*—*i.e., the most exalted rank*),\nit is still the **qi** rising from the **humble**—\nthus it is said: *\"The noble relies on the humble as its foundation.\"*\n\nEven if height reaches **Boundlessness**,\nit is still the **qi** ascending from the **lowly**—\nthus it is said: *\"The elevated rests upon the lowly as its base.\"*\n\nTake **Lords and kings** of the world—\nthough their rank is high as **Lords**,\ntheir title noble as **Kings**—\nthey know the **Dao/Way** rises from the **lowly**,\nnobility from the **humble**,\nthus they call themselves *\"Lonely\"* (*gū*), *\"Bereft\"* (*guǎ*), *\"Unworthy\"* (*bù gū*).\nIs this not relying on the **humble as foundation**?\n\nIf one does not dwell in the **humble**,\nbut places oneself too high,\nthen the **heart lacks a master**, the **Dao/Way** does not stand,\nthe **mind is scattered**, the **Spirit** does not coalesce.\nTo harmonize all things in **Great Centrality** (*Dà Zhōng*) and return to the **One Dao/Way**—\nhow few can achieve this!\n\nEven one who drives **many chariots** cannot govern both inner and outer,\nwhile one who drives a **single chariot** still holds its core—\nthus, having **many chariots** is like having none at all.\nGreed for multiplicity is not as good as embracing the **One**.\n\nLike **jade**, if it is **excessively polished and multiplied**,\nits value diminishes;\nlike **stone**, if it is **layered and precarious**,\ndanger arises—\nthese are what the **Supreme Sage** does not desire.\n\nHow much better to embrace the **One**,\nbeginning from the **humble** and **lowly**,\nultimately reaching heights beyond compare,\nnobility beyond speech—\nthis is the path of **cultivating the Dao/Way** to **perfection**,\nwhere there is **only the One**, no second.\n\nConfucius said: *\"My Dao/Way is one, threading through all.\"*\nMencius said: *\"The Dao/Way is one and only.\"*\nYet—what is this **One**?\n\nThe ancients spoke of **Hongmeng’s** boundless haze—\nwithout thought or defilement,\na **void yet luminous**, **quiet yet aware**—\nthis singular substance.\n\nWhen **expansive**, it contains the **Dharma-realm** (*Fǎjiè*);\nwhen **constricted**, not even a **speck of dust** can stand.\nWhen **manifest**, it reaches the **Nine Yí and Eight Huáng** without limit;\nwhen **hidden**, it scrutinizes the **finest motes** without omission.\nThis is the **Extreme of Boundlessness** (*Wújí zhī jí*),\nthe **Spirit beyond spirit** (*Bù shén zhī shén*),\ntruly beyond naming or conception.\nThe **Dao/Way of Nature and Life** is none other than this.\n\nThe **Supreme Sage** likens **Lords and kings** to the **human heart**—\nif the **heart** can constantly hold and preserve the **One**,\nwithout forgetting or aiding its excess,\nmoment by moment returning inward,\never internally illuminating,\nthen the **One** is never lost.\nThe **One** is **solitary** (*dú*).\n\nIn **solitary awareness**, with **awe and vigilance**,\nthis is the **original highest, noblest state**—\nperhaps it can be long preserved.\nYet this is the **study of cultivating Nature** (*xìng*),\nso **guarding the One in solitude** suffices to attain it.\n\nBut **nurturing Life** (*mìng*) involves action—\nif one does not begin from the **lowly** and refine from the **humble**,\neven the **elixir** is hard to obtain—\nwhat of the **Golden Elixir** (*jīndān*)?\n\nThe **lowly** refers to the **Lower Dantian** (*xià dāntián*);\nthe **humble** refers to the **filthy lower realm**.\nThe seeker, desiring the **One Yang’s revival** (*yī yáng lái fù*),\nmust have **qi** surging upward from below—\nhow else would one obtain **clear and firm qi** as the **treasure of longevity**?\n\nIf not by descending into the **Lower Field of Turbidity** (*xià tián zhuó xiāng*),\nusing **Spirit-fire** to illuminate downward,\nrefining the **most potent Yang qi**—\nhow else would one secure the **foundation of the Elixir**?\n\nThe ancients said: *\"Seeking Yang within Yin, stealing treasure from the ghost’s lair\"*—\ntruly not false!\n\nAbove all, one must have **a single heart, no dual thoughts**—\nthis is the **Dao/Way of guarding the One**.\n\nWhen naturally attained, **self and others are forgotten**—\nthen the **One** is obtained.\n\nWhen the cultivator reaches this state,\nall things and affairs are handled with ease and precision—\n*\"Obtaining the One, all matters are complete.\"*\nIs this not true?\n\nIf one clings to form and appearance, rushing about in pursuit of myriad affairs,\nentangled by the seven emotions and six desires,\nbound by family, wife, and children,\nreluctant to let go—\nthen the Dao/Way is distant indeed.\n\nDo not speak of external distractions as beyond the Dao—\neven in matters of nurturing the heart and nature,\ncultivating the Dao and refining the Elixir,\nadvancing fire and withdrawing talismans,\ngathering and sealing—\nall these names are but symbolic constructs,\nestablished as methods for later students.\n\nIf the mind harbors even a thread of impurity,\nit becomes an obstruction to the Dao.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* said: *\"Make the many into one, so that no wheel turns without a wheel\"*—\nnot desiring the gleam of jade or the rigidity of stone.\n\nThe Dao is but one Dao—\nwhy should the student seek elsewhere?\n\n**Chapter 40: The Generated from the Non-Generated**\n\n*\"The returning is the movement of the Dao;*\n*the yielding is the function of the Dao.\"*\n\nUnder heaven, all things are generated from the Existent,\nthe Existent from the Non-Generated.\n\nThe Great Dao is complete in all,\nperfect in each—\nwhy seek further?\n\nYet since birth, humans are bound by *qi* and obscured by things,\nlured by knowledge, ensnared by desires—\nthus the Dao is often drowned and lost.\n\nUnless one internally dispels all entanglements,\nexternally repels all disturbances,\nconcentrates the spirit and regulates the breath,\nabandons thought and forgets artifice—\nhow can the first Yang arise,\nhow can the Dao-qi return?\n\nThus it is said: *\"The returning is the movement of the Dao.\"*\nThis is the foundation of Elixir refinement.\n\nWhen the medicine returns to the furnace,\nthe Elixir coarsely forms,\nmercury and lead merge as one—\nday and night, one observes internally,\nand the Golden Elixir emerges.\n\nFrom this point onward, after gathering,\nit flows continuously, ever-present—\nhumble yet descending, yielding yet soft—\nthis is the marvel of the Returned Elixir.\n\nYet it is not only the Returned Elixir that requires this—\nfrom the first step to completion,\none must always focus the mind inwardly,\nconcentrate the *qi* to achieve softness.\n\nFor the Elixir is forged from the unified *qi* of Great Harmony;\nthe cultivator must treat it with humility and moderation.\nThe slightest roughness\nstirs the vulgar fire,\nharming the Dao.\n\nThus it is said: *\"The yielding is the function of the Dao.\"*\n\nThough all things under heaven\nbegin with form, appearance, matter, and principle,\ntheir origin does not arise from the Existent alone.\nThe Sage, when the Great Dao is complete,\nthough manifesting in myriad transformations,\npossesses all things—\nyet first, they gather and refine from the utmost emptiness and non-being,\nthen the great function flows, the vast *qi* fills the two extremes.\n\nIf not refined from non-being,\nhow could one encompass heaven and earth,\nbe so pervasive and boundless?\n\nThus it is said: *\"The Existent is generated from the Non-Generated.\"*\n\nThe essentials of a student’s cultivation:\nFirst, from non-being to being—\nfrom stillness, refining the subtle Yang;\nNext, from being to non-being—\nfrom agitation, returning to tranquility;\nFinally, again from non-being to being—\nmixed and indistinct, self and others forgotten—\nover time, the Yang spirit of three inches emerges,\nthe golden body of sixteen feet.\n\nThus being and non-being alternate endlessly,\ncycling without end.\nThe student must follow this path precisely,\nlest they err.\n\nThis speaks of the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir—\nnothing else, only the true *qi* flowing through the body,\nfilling it entirely.\nIn stillness, like the depths of a pool;\nin motion, like the surge of tides.\nOnly the pure and refined can inwardly illuminate,\nself-examine, and verify—\nthis cannot be exhausted by words.\n\nIf one understands that the moving principle is the root of my generation,\nthen the Elixir of eternal life—\nhow could it be external to this?\n\nMoreover, it is something shared by all—\nno difference, no lack.\nYet because the body moves and essence does not generate,\nthe mind moves and *qi* does not settle—\nthus the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death\nendlessly cycle, without end.\n\nIf one wishes to escape all this,\nthey must first attain nourishment in stillness,\nonly then can they seize the principle in motion,\nrestore the original *qi* of generation.\n\nBut this moving principle is subtle in force,\ndelicate in *qi*—\na moment’s carelessness,\nand suddenly *guǐshuǐ* arises,\ntransforming the original essence into post-heaven form—\nuseless.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Seen, it cannot be used;*\n*used, it cannot be seen.\"*\n\nFrom this single movement onward,\nif gathering is timely,\nthen longevity has its root,\nthe Great Elixir has its foundation.\n\nIf one clings to what is possessed and forces it,\nfixates on what is favored and guards it rigidly—\nthough the medicine may sometimes be obtained,\nthe Elixir may await completion—\nyet the *qi* is not pure and harmonious;\nthus later gathering and refining are flawed,\nand the unified *qi* of Great Harmony\nis injured by the violent vulgar fire.\n\nThe Dao’s most potent Yang must be nurtured with endurance,\nhumility, and softness—\nonly then can the Elixir’s path be fulfilled.\n\nThus the *Tàishàng* taught:\n*\"Dull its sharpness, untangle its chaos,*\n*harmonize its brilliance, blend it with the dust.\"*\n\nThough the Dao moves with *qi*,\nit remains the generation of being from non-being;\nif the Existent is not nourished with yielding,\nit cannot return to the emptiness of heaven—\nhow then could the Dao be complete?\n\nPeople know that the return of Yang is the Dao’s moving principle,\nyet they do not know that returning to the origin,\nthe manifest must revert to the non-manifest—\nfor the manifest is the Dao’s trace,\nthe non-manifest is the Dao’s truth.\n\nUnderstanding this, cultivation need not fear a lack of foundation.\n\n**Chapter 41: The Great Vessel Takes Long to Mature**\n\nThe superior sage hears the Dao and diligently practices it;\nthe mediocre sage hears the Way, now retaining it, now forgetting it;\nthe inferior sage hears the Dao and laughs at it—\nunless one laughs, it cannot be called the Dao.\n\nThus the *Tàishàng* proclaimed:\n*\"Clarify the Way as if in darkness,\nadvance the Way as if retreating,\nlevel the Way as if uneven,\nvirtue’s height as a valley,\ngreat brightness as disgrace,\nabundant virtue as insufficiency,\nestablished virtue as laziness,\nthe straightforward as mutable,\nthe great square as cornerless,\nthe great vessel as slow to mature,\nthe great sound as rare in tone,\nthe great image as formless.\"*\n\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless—\nonly the Dao can be freely given and fulfilled.\n\nBefore heaven and earth came into being,\nthere was only boundless void and indistinct haze,\na vast, indistinct *qi* of primordial harmony.\nAfter long fermentation, the *qi* transformed and filled the cosmos,\nand suddenly, with a stir, the *Tàijí* took root.\n\nMotion became Yang—light and clear *qi* rising to form heaven;\nstillness became Yin—heavy and turbid *qi* settling to form earth.\nWhen heaven and earth unfolded, all beings flourished.\nYet among countless multitudes, how few emulate heaven and earth’s function!\n\nOnly the sage, awakening from chaos, refines the Great Elixir.\nTo govern the body is to transform the world.\nThough I dare not remain silent, I do not indiscriminately teach all.\nFollowing circumstances and adapting to things,\nthis aligns with heaven and earth’s boundless, selfless measure.\n\nAt times, I meet the superior sage—\nhearing my Dao, he rejoices and pursues it diligently,\nwithout hesitation. Such a person I have long sought.\n\nAt times, I meet the mediocre sage—\nmy words enter his mind as commonplace,\nneither strange nor wondrous, yet he still cherishes them,\nyearning to attain them in a single stride.\nAlas, worldly tastes are thick while Dao’s flavor is thin,\nholy intent shallow while mundane thoughts run deep—\nhe drifts or conforms, retaining or losing it, unable to escape.\n\nAs for the inferior sage, deeply entrenched in habit,\nhis nature twisted, upon hearing my Dao,\nhe doubts it as deceitful, a delusion misleading the world,\nand accuses me of gathering crowds and amassing wealth.\nYet the gentleman’s cultivation begins with the union of Yin and Yang;\nthe sage’s Way lies within the interplay of heaven and earth—\nharmony brings life, resistance fosters transcendence.\nThough their methods differ, their essence is one,\nyet the vulgar scoff, calling divine transformation mere illusion.\nHow could such cultivation ascend beyond the celestial layers?\nOr how could one, nurturing this nature, merge with heaven and earth’s flow?\nYet why are sages and immortals so few throughout history?\nThus they mock my words as boastful, my conduct as deceitful and eccentric.\n\nAlas, this Way can only be revealed to kindred spirits,\nnot to those of shallow vision and limited hearing!\nThe mayfly knows not dusk, the cicada knows not seasons,\nthe well-frog knows not the sea—\nwhy should I be surprised at their laughter?\n\nUnless one laughs, how can one perceive the Dao’s utmost simplicity and constancy,\nits utmost divinity and strangeness—\nfor divinity and strangeness lie within the ordinary.\n\nThe Dao itself has no form, sound, or scent—\nwhat words can describe it?\nYet when words are spoken, it is only because later cultivators,\nlacking a clear path to progress or gradual ascent,\nmust resort to metaphor and false names to guide them.\n\nIf one truly knows the Dao as emptiness and nature as function,\none must proceed from Yin to Yang, from low to high.\nDarkness is the root of clarity, retreat the foundation of advancement.\nThough one is enlightened, one must seem obscured,\nso that hidden depths may reach their utmost clarity.\nThough one advances, one must seem to retreat,\nso that withdrawal may hasten, and progress extend further.\n\nThe Dao encompasses both near and far—\nthough I am in perfect accord with it,\nI remain as if unchanged in myself, unaltered toward others,\nequal and unassuming.\n\nThe Dao encompasses both great and small—\nthough I am one with virtue,\nI am as if neither having nor lacking,\nempty yet not full—\nvirtue as a valley.\n\nWhen the Dao shines brightly in the world,\npraised endlessly, never ceasing from lips,\nI feel no personal gain, only shame,\nthus it is said: *\"Great brightness as disgrace.\"*\n\nWhen virtue fills within,\nacting everywhere without exhaustion,\nI seem deficient, increasingly inadequate,\nthus it is said: *\"Abundant virtue as insufficiency.\"*\n\nWhen establishing virtue and conduct,\naligned with heaven and earth without contradiction,\nI seem self-satisfied and lazy,\nlacking the will to uplift,\nthus it is said: *\"Established virtue as laziness.\"*\n\nIf one’s sincerity is complete and nature exhausted,\nverified by spirits and gods without doubt,\nyet I seem mutable and unreliable,\nlacking firmness,\nthus it is said: *\"The straightforward as mutable.\"*\n\nSuch cultivation of heart and nature,\nvigilant and refined,\nthough slandered, leaves no opening for intrusion;\nthough corrupting influences abound, no gap remains to exploit.\nIn the world, those who cultivate the Dao and manifest virtue\nyet suffer disgrace—\nlet them reflect inward.\nIf one truly hides one’s traces, humbles oneself,\ntreasures disgrace, and extends virtue without claiming it,\nestablishes virtue without boasting—\ncould such a one be accused of deceit or called a fabricator?\n\nI know this is not the case.\nEven if fate is predetermined and calamities unavoidable,\nwhat heaven does, one must accept and submit to,\nresting in destiny while listening to heaven’s will.\nThus the gentleman bears lifelong concern,\nnot momentary distress—I am ever more certain of this.\n\nMoreover, the Dao has no fixed form, shape, sound, or scent to describe—\nthose who cling to rigid propriety, guarding themselves,\ncannot move freely and naturally.\nI, however, am the great square without corners,\na boundless unity, unconfined by edges—\nwhat need for hesitation?\n\nThe things that are easily attained are not beautiful to behold,\nand those hastened to completion are not great vessels.\n\nI can follow the Way step by step, ascending without seeking swift results,\nnot reckoning shallow gains, abiding long in its practice—\nthus great attainment is surely possible, why should I feel deficient within?\n\nIndeed, the Dao is subtle beyond words, naturally elusive.\nIt is best described as vague and indistinct.\n\nI can attain to the utmost emptiness and profound stillness,\nthen the great sound arises without sound,\nand the great form manifests without form!\n\nIts application spans the four seas and remains ever valid,\nits transmission through ten thousand generations knows no end—\nhow could it merely be esteemed in one age,\nwhile failing to shine through all future generations?\n\nThe *Shijing* says:\n*\"There is none there who is evil,\nAnd here is none who is not pure.\"*\n\nThe Dao’s establishment and practice truly possess such divine and wondrous qualities.\n\nBetween these, who is the doer and who is the recipient?\nIt is also said:\n*\"To practice the Dao is to lend virtue generously and complete it.\"*\n\nThis is the way of those who embrace the Dao in the world—\ntheir use is never insufficient,\nthey give to all things without depletion,\nand even beyond the dusty boundaries of existence, they have abundance.\nMoreover, they enable the transformation of all things to flourish,\ntruly the highest adept.\n\nThe **Tàishàng** warns against those who do not conceal their light nor cultivate obscurity,\nwho establish virtue and refine the self—\nthose who, upon gaining even a little, boast and exalt themselves.\n\nWhile the **Five Aggregates** remain unemptied and the **Six Dusts** uncleansed,\nthey are like a house roofed with straw and thatch,\nfire that still relies on fuel to burn.\n\nIf one only cultivates oneself without seeking harmony with others,\nthey drift aimlessly, returning to the realm of **Nonbeing**—\nthe boundless wilds where nothing exists.\nEven if external harm comes,\nit is like lighting a fire in empty space—\nit will eventually extinguish itself.\n\nSuch cultivation is true cultivation of the self.\nOnly when done thusly\ncan people and people both rest in peace within the Dao’s boundless expanse,\notherwise, they gain nothing from the Dao\nand instead invite blame.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Being without yet appearing as having,\nemptiness without yet seeming full,\nrestraint without yet becoming expansive.\"*\n\nHis insight into what others despise is fitting indeed.\n\nFor those who cultivate the Dao in this manner,\nthey can be free from the need to seek external validation,\nand also avoid the distress of external blame.\n\n**Chapter 42: Loss and Gain**\nThe Dao gives birth to **One**,\n**One** gives birth to **Two**,\n**Two** gives birth to **Three**,\n**Three** gives birth to all things.\n\nAll things carry **yin** within and embrace **yang**,\nand the **succession of qi** brings harmony.\n\nWhat people detest are the lonely, widowed, and childless,\nyet kings and nobles prize such titles.\n\nThus, some things are diminished yet gain,\nwhile others are increased yet lose.\n\nWhat people revere, I also teach:\n*\"The strong and arrogant will not meet their end.\"*\n\nI shall take this as my guiding principle.\n\nThe Daoists, from beginning to end, refine and cultivate,\nholding **emptiness and nonexistence** as their ultimate essence.\n\nThe **Primordial Heavenly Sovereign**,\nwhose Dao-name is **Emptiness-Naturalness**,\nexpresses this very meaning.\n\nFrom emptiness comes reality—\nthis is called **true reality**.\nFrom nonexistence comes existence—\nthis is called **true existence**.\n\nIf one does not embrace emptiness nor nonexistence,\nnot only are the **Seven Emotions and Six Desires** stifled,\nbut the true spirit and original nature are also blocked,\nleaving no means to respond to all things or transform the **yang spirit**.\n\nEven if one practices **observing emptiness and illumination**,\nand clings with even a trace of stubborn resolve,\nit is still a case of the mind controlling the mind,\ndirectly obscuring the original face beyond recognition.\n\nIn summary, **emptiness and nonexistence** are the Dao’s essence,\n**harmonious succession** is its function.\nIf humans can align with this,\nthen the Dao is nearly attained.\n\nThe **Tàishàng** says: *\"The Dao gives birth to One\"*—\nwhat does the Dao possess?\nOnly **emptiness**.\n\nYet within the utmost emptiness,\na single **qi** stirs—\nand heaven and earth are born.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"There was a **cosmic unity** before heaven and earth were formed.\"*\n\nBefore the **Ultimate Void**,\nit was **mixed and chaotic**—\njust this one emptiness.\n\nWhen it moves, it becomes **yang**;\nwhen it stills, it becomes **yin**—\nthis is the *\"**Great Polarity** of the *Yijing*, from which the **Two Complements** arise.\"*\n\nThis is the saying:\n*\"The Dao gives birth to One, One gives birth to Two.\"*\n\nIn the human body,\nit is within the **subtle and indistinct**,\nthat **One Awareness** splits open—\nthe opening and closing of **Heaven and Earth**,\nthe ebb and flow of **qi**—\nstillness and condensation form **yin** and **essence**;\nmovement and circulation form **yang** and **qi**.\n\nIf there is no **true intention** of the **Primordial Spirit** to govern them,\nthen **yin** and **yang** scatter in disorder,\nand there is no way to generate life and attain the Dao.\n\nIt is clear that between the **two qi of yin and yang**,\nthe **Primordial Spirit** and **true intention** are greatly relied upon to maintain their balance—\nthis is the saying: *\"Two gives birth to Three.\"*\n\nFrom this,\n**one yin and one yang**,\n**one movement and one stillness**,\n**qi** flows in transformation,\nits sovereignty remains unchanged—\nand all things are born endlessly—\nthis is the saying: *\"Three gives birth to all things.\"*\n\nSome say:\n*\"Heaven One generates water, yet metal also generates water;\nEarth Two generates fire, yet wood also generates fire;\nHeaven Three generates wood, yet water also generates wood;\nEarth Four generates metal, yet soil also generates metal.\"*\n\nUsing the **Five Phases** to explain the **Primordial Sovereign’s** meaning of *\"One, Two, Three, and all things\"*—\nthis is all strained interpretation;\nit is not as clear as the theory:\nthe Dao is the **Ultimate Void**,\nOne is the **Great Polarity**,\nTwo are **yin and yang**,\nHeaven One and Earth Two combine to form Three—\nthis is the explicit reasoning.\n\n*\"All things carry yin within and embrace yang,\nand the **succession of qi** brings harmony\"*\nclearly shows the Dao as the **Primordial Qi of Emptiness-Naturalness**,\ntransforming into **yin and yang**,\nand all things are born from **yin and yang**.\n\n**Succession** means **central harmony**—\nif **yin and yang** lack this central **qi**,\nthen the center has no master, and the master is unsettled.\nEven the birth of things is difficult,\nlet alone cultivating the Dao?\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth in their **primordial state**,\nall things become **pure and complete**.\"*\n\nIt is evident that the **Three Treasures**—**essence, qi, spirit**—\nmust all be fully realized,\nso that **yin and yang** unite with the **Great Polarity** and become inseparable.\n\nIf **yin and yang** are distinct yet the **Great Polarity** is lost,\nthen the **transformative power** falters,\nand the generative mechanism of all things is extinguished.\nGenerally speaking,\neven in refining the Dao and alchemical elixirs,\none cannot do without **true yin and true yang**,\nbut without the **Great Harmony’s Primordial Qi**,\nthe elixir cannot be formed,\nand the Dao is difficult to attain—\nfor the Dao is originally the **Great Harmony’s single qi**, structured and complete.\n\nGenerating humans or immortals\nis but one principle,\nthe only difference lies in whether one follows or opposes it.\n\nThe **Primordial Qi** is the substance,\nwhile **yin and yang** are its functions—\nthus the Dao of **Golden Elixir** is attained.\n\nObserve the kings and nobles,\nwhose rank is highest,\nwhose fortune most exalted—\nyet they call themselves *\"lonely\"* (*gu*), *\"widowed\"* (*guǎ*), *\"unworthy\"* (*bùgǔ*).\nWhat is their intent?\n\nFor the lofty are prone to peril,\nthe full to depletion—\nlike lightning’s flash, followed by thunder’s strike.\nOnly those who do not cling to their height,\nwho do not boast of their nobility,\nbut instead cultivate a heart of humility and gentleness,\nmay long preserve their wealth and power,\nand escape ruin.\n\nThus, what common folk abhor—\n*\"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" \"unworthy\"*—\nare the very titles of kings and nobles.\n\nIf the **Dao** is the supreme treasure of Heaven and Earth,\nhow can those who cultivate it ignore the virtue of humility and gentleness?\n\nThe *Classic of Documents* says:\n*\"Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain.\"*\nNone have ever escaped this truth.\n\nGain does not begin with gain—\nit must first be lost, then gained anew.\nLoss does not begin with loss—\nit must first be gained, then lost.\n\nThus, riches and poverty,\nprosperity and adversity,\nextreme bending yields to stretching,\nand extreme stretching must bend again—\nthis is the cyclical **Heavenly Dao**,\nthe natural order,\neven Heaven and Earth cannot evade it,\nhow much less can mortals?\n\nAh! Human affairs are thus—\nhow different is the **Great Dao**?\n\nThe adept seeks the **One Yang’s Revival** (*yī yáng lái fù*),\nyet first must all entanglements be extinguished,\npure and tranquil **Harmonious Qi** alone remaining,\nwith no trace of restless ambition.\n\nOnly through ceaseless diminishment—\nuntil nothing remains—\ndoes **True Yang** arise within the congealed **group yin**,\nbringing no small benefit to the self.\n\nBut if one arrogantly prizes their talents,\nboasts of their wisdom,\ntheir mind will not be empty,\nand their ambition will be full—\nnone escape being misled by their own thoughts,\nor consumed by errant fire.\n\nTo seek gain and instead suffer loss—\nthis is the way of all things under Heaven,\nnot only in the cultivation of the **Dao**.\n\nAs for all worldly affairs,\nthey are but illusory phantoms,\nunworthy of fixation—\nyet still, people take them as lessons for the uninitiated.\n\nKnow that the **Great Dao of Golden Elixir**\nconcerns the present moment,\nyet its consequences stretch across eternity—\nhow can it not be taken as law?\n\nThus the **Supreme Sage** said:\n*\"What others teach, I too teach.\"*\nWhat is taught?\n**Ultimate gentleness** alone.\n\nIf one does not employ gentleness but instead relies on force,\nthey will be like the tyrants of the world—\nravaging and plundering,\nyet none escape the law’s net,\nor meet a good end.\n\nThus, the proud and violent court death,\nwhile gentleness is the path to life—\nthis is truly the essential method of cultivation.\n\nMy teaching to others begins with gentleness and weakness—\nhow can the adept afford to neglect it?\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality* says:\n*\"From emptiness, the **Primordial Qi** is born,\nfrom **Qi**, **yin and yang** arise.\n**Yin and yang** form the **Three Bodies**,\nand the **Three Bodies** give rise to all flourishing things.\"*\nThis is the meaning of:\n*\"One generates Two, Two generates Three, Three generates all things.\"*\n\nAt the outset of seated meditation,\none must first extinguish all emotional ties,\nsweep away delusions,\nattain utter emptiness and stillness,\nindistinguishable from stupor—\nneither fully asleep nor awake.\nThis is the undifferentiated **Hun-Dun** state,\nthe very **Dao**.\n\nSuddenly, a stir—\na dim awakening.\nAfter this movement,\nall phenomena seem void,\nyet a single **Spirit** moves alone—\nembracing the **Primordial**, preserving the **One**—\nsome call it **True Mind**,\nothers **Right Awareness**,\nor the **Buddha’s Perfect and Equal Awakening**.\n\nAt this moment, there is but one mind,\nno duality of thought.\n\nIf the **Yang** generates and the **medicine** matures,\nand its vigor is robust and harmonious,\nthen apply the **Two-Phase Method**:\n**First Phase**: Collect and return to the **Palace**—one phase.\n**Second Phase**: Seal and consolidate in the **Furnace**—another phase.\n\nThis is the **One Movement** as **Yang**—**Yang** governs ascent;\nthe **One Stillness** as **Yin**—**Yin** governs descent.\n\nObserve the strength of the **Qi’s** movement—\nif it is now fully vigorous,\nthen begin the **River-Vehicle’s** circulation,\nwith the **Four Phases** of collection:\n**Boiling, refining, ingestion, and alchemy**—\nthus **True Mercury** is purified.\n\nThis is the **collection of Yang** and **union with Yin**,\nall arising from the **One**.\n\nEven in a single breath,\na single opening or closing—\n**Qi** divides from **One** into **Two** without fail.\n\nYet the **heart’s essence** and **kidney’s qi**,\nthe **heart’s yin** and **kidney’s yang**—\nall depend on **True Mind** for collection,\nrefinement, copulation, and harmonization.\n\nThus, **yin and yang** as **Two Qi**,\nunited with **True Mind** as the **Three Bodies**,\nall unfolding naturally—\nno contrivance, no artificial forcing.\n\nYet it must begin with humility and retreat.\nThe slightest trace of arrogance or self-strengthening—\nat best, the **Elixir** is ruined;\nat worst, life is forfeited.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The violent do not meet a natural death—\nI take this as my lesson.\"*\n\nStudents must know:\nBefore attaining the **Elixir**, rely on a **quiet and still** mind;\nafter attaining it, nourish with **gentle and harmonious** intent—\nbeware of excessive thought or worry,\nof pride or self-assertion.\n\nThis is the **supreme key within the key**—\nlet the student take heed!\n\nOtherwise, filled with delusions,\nhow can the **Dao** endure?\nSuch cultivation is **blind alchemy**—\nall rigidity, so that even attainment becomes loss.\n\nSuch practice is **blind cultivation**—\nwithout medicine or **Elixir**, yet rushing to collect and refine,\nnot only burning in vain,\nbut surely damaging **Spirit** and **essence**.\n\nThe harm to body and mind is no small matter—\nyet still they refuse to blame themselves,\ninstead blaming the **Dao** as false,\nthe **Golden Elixir** as untrustworthy:\nSuch a one truly does not know the **Dao** as **Way**.\n\nOnly in **utter emptiness** and **utter gentleness**,\nby preserving the mind in **quiet stillness**,\nand nourishing the **Qi** in **harmony**,\ncan the **Dao** fail to succeed?\n\nThis speaks of the **Daoist**’s cultivation—\nto heal ailments, prolong life,\nascend as an immortal, become a sage—\nall rests on the **Three Treasures** alone.\n\nYet **essence** is not the **essence of copulation**,\nbut the **Primordial True Suchness**—\na luminous **Spirit**—\nas when it was said:\n*\"Vague and indistinct, yet within it, forms exist.\"*\n\nThis arises from **emptiness**, and **emptiness** is the **Dao**. *\"The **Dao** gives birth to One\"* means **emptiness** generates **essence**, and **essence** is **nature**. **Qi** is not the **Qi** of breathing, but rather *\"the Primordial True Suchness, a single **Qi** diffused\"*—as was said before: *\"Vague and indistinct, within it, things exist.\"*\n\nThis arises from **One**, and **One** is **essence**. *\"One gives birth to Two\"* means **essence** generates **Qi**, and **Qi** is **life-force**. **Spirit** is not the **Spirit** of deliberation, but rather *\"the luminous radiance alone, clear and unwavering\"*—as was said before: *\"Dim and dark, within it, **essence** exists, that **essence** most true, within it, **faith** is.\"* From Two, the myriad transformations arise; **Two** is **Qi**, and *\"Two gives birth to Three\"* means **Qi** generates **Spirit**—**Spirit** being the **Primordial True Suchness** and the **True Will**.\n\nAll are transformations of the **Great Harmony**, a single **Qi**. Only by **gentleness** and **harmony** can one nurture it, and thus attain it.\n\nIf one clings to **One** with **impatience**, or harbors a **violent and harsh** **Qi**, these are of a different kind, far from the **Dao**.\n\nEven preserving the body is difficult—how much more so to aspire to immortality! Hence the **strictures against excess**.\n\nThe **Taoist Master** teaches through **endurance of suffering** and **compassionate mercy**, so His words are thus.\n\nConfucius expounded the *Book of Changes*, and in the **Modest** hexagram, he thrice expressed his intent, while the **golden person’s tilted vessel** and such demonstrate His profound instruction—is this not the same meaning?\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: The Benefit of Non-Action**\n\n*\"The **Dao** of utmost **gentleness**,\nranges across the **Dao** of utmost **firmness**.\nThere is no entering into the **Dao** of no interstice—\nthus I know the benefit of **non-action**.\"*\n\nThe **Dao** of **silent instruction**,\nthe **benefit of non-action**,\nthe world few can attain.\n\nWhat is the **Dao**? It is the **Primordial Chaos**, a single **Qi**.\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth opened,\nthis **Qi** existed in the **void**.\nAfter Heaven and Earth were formed,\nthis **Qi** dwelled within Heaven and Earth.\n\nThis **Qi** was eternal before Heaven and Earth,\nand does not perish after them.\nWhen Heaven and Earth obtained this **Qi**,\nthey became the **Dao**.\nThe **Dao** being Heaven and Earth,\nthe **Dao** is contained within them.\n\nOnly Heaven and Earth can embrace this **Qi**,\nthus their eternal transformation.\nThe **eternal unobstructed** is this **Qi**,\nthe **endlessly flowing**, sustaining all beings—also this **Qi**,\nfor all is interconnected by one **Qi**.\n\nThe Sage models himself after Heaven and Earth.\nHis **sincerity** within is what manifests outwardly;\nthough inner and outer differ,\nthe **Qi** remains undivided.\nHis fulfillment of self is what perfects others;\nthough self and others vary,\nthe **Qi** is never split.\n\nWhat is its nature?\nIt is **emptiness**.\n\nWhen one **Qi** is clear, all **Qi** is clear;\n**emptiness** is never obscure—\nwhen one **Qi** is clear,\nall **Qi** is illuminated.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"To govern is like the North Star in its place,\nwhile all the stars naturally bow in reverence.\"*\n\nMencius said:\n*\"The virtuous man surpasses the transformations,\nhis **Spirit** flows with Heaven and Earth above and below.\"*\n\nThis is the **sincerity** that,\nwithout pause or delay,\ncan naturally be one with the **Qi**,\npermeating and sustaining all.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The greatness of the world, from me it is at ease.\nThe multitude of beings, from me they are nourished.\nThe vastness of past and present, from me it is connected.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s **Dao** is truly boundless.\nReflecting upon this,\nwhat is the limit of the universe?\nThe **Dao** can encompass it—how vast is it!\nEven gold and jade, the firmest of substances,\nthe **Dao** can penetrate them—is it not **firm**?\n\nYet it is heard in the *Book of Odes*:\n*\"The mandate of Heaven, serene and ceaseless.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"The carriage of Heaven, silent and odorless.\"*\n\nHere is **gentleness** beyond compare.\nThough Heaven and Earth lack this **Qi**,\nthey would be inert and useless.\nThough beings lack this **Qi**,\nthey would be dull and lifeless.\n\nWith it, they live;\nwithout it, they perish.\nThis is *\"the **Dao** of utmost **gentleness**,\nranging across the **Dao** of utmost **firmness**\"*—\nfor without **Qi**, there is no substance.\n\nGreat as the **Three Thousand Worlds**,\nsmall as dust or hair,\nall are contained within this **Qi**.\nNot only is it of utmost **gentleness**,\nbut it is also of **utter nothingness**—\nis this not what Confucius meant by:\n*\"See it not, hear it not,\ntouch it not—yet it cannot be dismissed?\"*\n\nHow can there be separation?\nWhen things reach ultimate **gentleness**, they lose their use;\nyet the **Dao**’s ultimate **gentleness** alone sustains the world’s utmost **firmness**.\nWhen things reach **utter nothingness**, what purpose do they serve?\nOnly the **Dao**’s **utter nothingness** governs all existence.\n\nThis is but the **Primordial Chaos**, a single **Qi**,\nflowing without obstruction.\n\nThus the **Taoist Master** says:\n*\"Thus I know the benefit of **non-action**.\"*\n\nMoreover, Heaven and Earth act without **action** yet transform,\nthe Sage governs without **action** yet rules.\nNo single person or thing escapes their influence—\nis this not the **Qi**’s all-encompassing and boundless sway?\n\nWithin the human body,\nthe **vast and pure **Qi** flows naturally,\nnot requiring forced circulation,\nbut spontaneously irrigating the whole frame,\nfilling every hair and pore—\nits benefits are indeed profound.\n\nAs for the **Dao**’s instruction,\nthe ancients taught by **example**, not by words.\nThe **Dao** of teaching is truly not twice as real as the **Dao** of non-teaching.\n\nHeaven does not speak, yet the seasons proceed;\nthe Sage does not speak, yet the world transforms.\nTo observe the **North Star’s** upright posture,\nor the **Sage’s** humble bearing—\nare these not of the same **Dao**?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The **Dao** of silent instruction,\nthe **benefit of non-action**,\nthe world few can attain.\"*\n\nAh, how profound!\nThis describes the **Dao**’s natural **non-action**,\nencompassing Heaven and Earth,\nnourishing all beings,\nrooted in the **Great Harmony**, a single **Qi**,\nflowing through the cosmos,\npenetrating Heaven and humanity,\nwith neither great nor small,\nnor hidden nor revealed,\nall fully present.\n\nHere is the **Dao** of utmost **gentleness** yet able to birth utmost **firmness**,\nof **utter nothingness** yet able to contain all existence.\nThus, one **Qi** connects to all **Qi**,\none movement sets all in motion—\nechoes in an empty valley,\neach sound answered in kind.\n\nThis **Dao**’s divine mystery—\nnone can surpass it!\nWho but the **Sage** could grasp it thus?\n\nIf one is but a novice,\nyet holds true faith in mind,\nand sets a bold resolve,\nfollowing the **Way** and keeping to its path,\nfrom shallow to deep,\nfrom low to high,\nbeginning with forced effort,\nyet through time becoming natural,\nonly then can one pierce through its essence.\n\nOne must endure, endure again,\nand bear, bear once more,\nthrough the twelve **times** of day,\nwithout stirring **disgust** or **retreat** in heart.\nWhen deep understanding dawns,\none rests in **tranquility**, nurturing life’s **vitality**,\nencountering abundance on all sides,\nthen suddenly comprehends the **Great Harmony’s** intent—\ntruly without a false word.\n\nAs for refining the **foundation of cultivation**,\nthe ancients said:\n*\"When **essence** is born, there is a chance to refine the **medicine**,\nwhen the **medicine** appears, there is a chance to gather it.\"*\n\n**Primordial Qi**, born of **God**, generates **essence**,\n**essence** then generates **Qi**—\nthis is the principle by which Heaven and Earth give birth to all things,\nin accord with the **Dao**.\n\nIf one follows it naturally,\nthough able to bear sons and daughters,\n**essence** will be drained,\n**Qi** will scatter,\nuntil exhaustion and death.\n\nThe **Great Harmony** pities mortal men,\nlost in the **waves of birth and death**,\nendlessly **revolving**—\nthus it reveals the **Dao of inverse cultivation**,\nreturning to the **root**, restoring youth to age,\nstrength to weakness,\nuntil one attains **immortality** and **sainthood**,\nforever beyond **birth and death**.\n\nAt first, it teaches one to **attain emptiness** and **nurture stillness**,\nfrom the state of **ignorance and unawareness**,\nseeking the place of **awareness and knowledge**.\nThe *I Ching* says:\n*\"Motionless yet responsive—\nthis is the **Dao** of **primordial transformation**.\"*\n\n**Postnatal essence** has form,\n**Primordial essence** leaves no trace—\nyet within the **vague and indistinct**,\nthere is substance.\nThis is called **\"the Mysterious Pass\"**—\nwhen stirred, the **Great Polarity** is established.\nFrom here, one **concentrates the spirit** in **emptiness**,\n**unites the Qi** in **voidness**,\n**illuminates the mind** within,\nobserving the **breath’s** ebb and flow—\nopening and closing,\nrising and falling,\nascending and descending,\nretrieving it back to the **Central Palace**,\nbathing and nourishing it warmly.\n\nIn a short while, at the **boundless depths**,\nsuddenly a thought arises from within the **rules**,\na **Qi** emerges from **emptiness**—\nthis is **essence generating Qi**.\n\nThis **Qi** is not of form—\nif it were of form,\nthen it would have **beginning and end**,\n**limits and measure**—\nhow could it embrace Heaven and Earth,\npenetrate the finest **hair**,\nbe present in all things,\nand shatter all **rigidity**?\n\nThis **Qi** is the **root of life** for all things—\nto grasp it is to live,\nto lose it is to die.\nThough it is **uttermost gentleness**,\nit can command the **uttermost firmness**,\nthough it is **uttermost nothingness**,\nit can govern the **uttermost existence**.\nThe ancient **immortals** likened it to **medicine**,\nfor it can cure **aging and sickness**,\nand nourish the **embryo of immortality**.\n\nThus they say:\n*\"The elixir of **prolonged life**,\nthe **returning-soul nectar**,\"*\nand also:\n*\"The **True Person’s** root of **long life**.\"*\nIndeed, it is the **world’s most precious treasure**.\n\nThe ancients declared:\n*\"A thousand weights of gold\ncannot be exchanged for even a thread of this **Qi**.\"*\n\nIf mortals can obtain this **Qi**,\nthen **long life** is assured.\n\nYet the method of gathering it\nmust also **harmonize with the center** and **align upright**,\nonly then can one avoid **calamity**.\n\nIf one has **medicine** but fails to blend it properly,\nor **refine it** poorly,\nor takes it at an **improper time**,\nor nourishes it without **right method**,\nand misjudges the **fire’s** strength—\nwhether **cultivating** or **harvesting**,\nwhether **old** or **tender**,\nwhether **heavy** or **light** in dosage—\nany error will bring disaster,\njust as when **yin and yang**,\n**cold and heat**,\nshift out of season,\nleading to **heavenly calamities**,\nand all things perishing.\n\nStudents who **harmonize** the **Great Harmony’s** teachings,\nboth **earlier and later chapters**,\nand **apply them** with care,\nwill never go astray.\n\nI reveal this **cultivation method**—\ntruly worth more than **ten thousand gold**!\nIf one can **penetrate** this **secret**,\nthen in all things there is **grasp**,\nthe **elixir of long life** can be obtained,\nand the **lands of the immortals** will pose no difficulty.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The More You Hoard, the Greater Your Loss**\nWhich is more **intimate**—\n**name** or **body**?\nWhich is more **abundant**—\n**body** or **wealth**?\nWhich brings more **suffering**—\n**gain** or **loss**?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The more you cherish, the greater your **expenditure**,\nthe more you hoard, the greater your **depletion**.\"*\n\n**Knowing contentment** brings no **humiliation**,\n**knowing restraint** brings no **peril**—\nthus one may **endure long**.\n\nMen who **covet name** and **wealth**,\ndo not all believe\nthat **name** can exalt their **body**,\nthat **wealth** can nourish their **body**—\nif the **body** lacks **name**, it will be **obscured** and **unrenowned**;\nif the **body** lacks **wealth**, it will be **wretched** and **hard-pressed**.\n\nThus, those who **pursue name**,\nforsake their **body** without **regard**;\nthose who **covet wealth**,\nlose their **body** without **hesitation**.\n\nThe merchant **Jia** said:\n*\"The greedy man **serves wealth**,\nthe **resolute hero** **serves name**.\"*\nHuman nature is thus—\nthe same throughout **ancient and modern times**.\n\nYet consider:\nWhich is more **intimate**—\n**name** or **body**?\n**Name** is **external**,\n**body** is **internal**.\nMen seek **name** for their **body**—\nwhy then **endanger the body** for **name**?\nIs it not that **name** is **distant**,\nwhile the **body** is **near**?\n\nWhich is more **abundant**—\n**body** or **wealth**?\nThe **body** is **noble**,\n**wealth** is **base**.\nAll seek **wealth** for their **body**—\nwhy then **lose the body** for **wealth**?\nIs it not that the **body** is **scarce**,\nwhile **wealth** is **plentiful**?\n\nHow **foolish** their thoughts are!\n\nIf one has **name** yet **nature** is lost,\nor one has **body** yet **name** is not exalted—\nwhich is **gain**, which is **loss**?\n\nTo **forsake the body** while **wealth** remains **empty**,\nor to **lose wealth** yet **life** remains **firm**—\nwhich endures, which perishes?\n\nBy this reasoning,\nit is better to **gain the body** and **lose name and wealth**,\nthan to **gain name and wealth** while **losing the body**.\n\nMoreover, those who **covet name and wealth**,\n**diminish their spirit** and **harm their life**—\ntheir **excessive love** brings **great expenditure**;\nthose who **hoard deeply**,\nemploy **scheming** and **injure** their **body and mind**—\ntheir **abundant storage** brings **great depletion**.\n\nTo be **held in esteem** is to be **feared by the state**,\nto **accumulate wealth** is to be **resented by the **Creator****.\n\nFrom ancient times,\nmen of **great power** have **suffered calamity**,\nthose with **much wealth** have been **put to death**—\nhow many such cases are there!\n\nAll because they **failed to restrain** themselves,\ndid not **withdraw** in time,\n**greedily pursued** more without **end**,\nthus **incurring the people’s enmity**,\nand **earning Heaven’s punishment**.\n\nOnly those who **know contentment** and **know restraint**,\nremain **steady** and **unshaken**,\nfree from **humiliation** and **peril**,\nwithout **danger** or **inclination to fall**,\nand thus **long preserve** their **body**,\neven unto their **descendants**.\n\n「Thus **Rang Li** avoided **the calamity of Goujian**,\nand **Zhang Liang** attained **the leisure of the Red Pine Immortal**.\n\nTruly, they were men who understood the **subtle Dao**!\n\nLet those who follow them take heed of this **cultivated wisdom**.\n\nThis is an analogy of **knowing contentment and restraint** to **stoking the furnace and nurturing the elixir**,\nusing **renown** to liken **the illusory landscape**,\nand **wealth** to liken **the medicinal alchemy**.\n\nThose who **covet the phantom landscape** are often **ensnared by demons**,\nand those who **pursue external transport** seldom escape **fate’s retribution**.\n\nBefore the **medicine returns to the cauldron**,\nit must be **stirred by flame** to refine it;\nonce the **medicine enters the tripod**,\nthe **flame must be restrained** to cultivate it.\n\nIf the **flame is unrestrained** and one fails to **halt its force**,\nnot only will the **elixir fail** and the **tripod overturn**,\nbut one will **invite sickness and misfortune**,\nand even **lose life and burn the body**,\nfalling into **great peril and ruin**.\n\nAnd yet, the **Great Dao** is **void and boundless**,\nwith no grand distinction among mortals.\n\nSome **lust after fine wine and delicacies**,\n**adorn themselves with beauty and splendor**,\n**hoard gold, jade, pearls, and precious stones**,\n**pursue palaces and towers**;\n\nOthers **face temptations from celestial and earthly demons**,\n**ghostly and divine demons**,\nas **various trials** come to test their **Dao**—\nsome **boast of becoming immortals**,\nothers **claim to be true humans**,\n**proudly asserting they have ascended to the Celestial Hall of Precious Ascension**—\nyet because of **a single stray thought**,\ntheir **spirit is depleted**,\nand **many fail to attain the Great Dao**.\n\nOr some **mistakenly revere the spirit**,\nand **the Three Corpses** become their **bane**,\n**believing there is a body beyond the body**,\nwhile the **golden elixir**, the **supreme treasure**,\n**is squandered in an instant**—\nsuch cases are also numerous.\n\nAll these misfortunes arise from\n**the flame being unrestrained** and **fire not halted**,\n**the elixir failing to return** and **not being nurtured**,\nthus **their aspirations scatter** while **their spirit dissipates**,\n**outer distractions disrupt** and **inner essence perishes**.\n\nFor those who **cultivate the Dao**,\n**illusory renown, illusory forms,**\n**illusory landscapes, and illusory shapes**,\nmust be **dismissed with a single stroke**,\n**taken with no attachment**—\nso, in **knowing restraint and contentment**,\nand **constantly nurturing the spiritual elixir**,\nthey **attain ultimate goodness**,\nand **never face decline or ruin**.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Fifth: Great Attainment as Deficiency**\nGreat attainment appears as deficiency,\nyet its **utility is unexhausted**.\n\nGreat fullness seems as emptiness,\nyet its **utility is inexhaustible**.\n\nGreat rectitude appears as bending,\ngreat skill as clumsiness,\ngreat eloquence as stammering.\n\n**Calmness overcomes coldness**, **tranquility overcomes heat**,\n**purity and stillness** are the **right path for the world**.\n\nThe **Dao** is naturally **void and boundless**,\n**moving in accordance with Heaven**,\n**acting in alignment with innate nature**,\n**uniting with the creation of Heaven and Earth**,\n**sharing the eternal rise of Sun and Moon**—\n**having nothing yet possessing all things**,\n**doing nothing yet accomplishing all things**.\n\nWhen the **Great Dao** is not yet fully attained or filled,\nthere are still **traces of action**,\n**forms and images** that can be glimpsed,\nand one feels **self-satisfied and content**,\n**overwhelmed with joy**;\n\nYet when **great attainment** is finally achieved,\nit seems as if **deficiencies abound**,\nand **great attainment** appears as **no attainment at all**.\n\nWhen **great fullness** is reached,\nit seems like **void and formless emptiness**,\nand **great fullness** appears as **never having been filled**.\n\nIs this not **the more one studies, the worse one becomes**,\n**the more one excels, the more one is disparaged**?\n\nNo, it is not so.\n\nFor the **Dao** is inherently the **original good** of mankind—\n**pure, empty, and without trace**,\n**still and settled**—\nwhen **form and spirit** are both **perfectly refined**,\nand **one’s essence merges with the True Dao**,\n**self and Dao become one**—\nwhat **attainment** or **fullness** remains?\n\nIf **attainment and fullness** still persist,\nthen **self and Dao remain as two**,\nand **one has not yet reached the realm of divine transformation**.\n\nThus, for those who **cultivate the Dao**,\n**the more they possess, the more they relinquish**,\n**the more they accumulate, the more they diminish**—\nthey **never see attainment or fullness**.\n\nHence, **great attainment appears as deficiency**,\nand **great fullness as emptiness**.\n\nTherefore, **all phenomena are emptied**,\nand **one alone embraces the True**.\n\n**Taking things as causes**,\n**responding naturally to times**,\n**truly filling Heaven and Earth**,\n**penetrating past and present**,\n**universal and unchanging**—\n\nHow could its **utility ever be exhausted**?\nHow could its **application ever be spent**?\n\nWhen the mind is empty as the sea,\nand the spirit still as a mountain,\nyet one feels utterly useless—\nthen suddenly, when **qi** expands boundless,\nwhen **virtue/power** is supreme and vast,\nhow could it be so straightforward?\nYet one finds the burden of constraint unbearable.\n\nWhen **spirit** is wondrous and boundless,\ncapable of constancy and change,\nhow could it be so ingenious?\nYet one only feels the stupidity of ignorance.\n\nWhen speech is plain yet meaning profound,\nwhen words are few yet truth subtle,\nspeaking only when necessary,\nuttering only when the time is right—\nhow could eloquence be so vast?\nYet one feels only stammering,\nas if unable to speak at all.\n\nBecause of this—\nthis bending, this clumsiness, this stammering—\nthe heart aligns with **emptiness**,\nthe will with **humility**,\n**virtue/power** with **breadth**,\nand deeds grow ever more sublime.\n\nThis is indeed the **Dao** returning to **emptiness**,\nlearning returning to **spontaneity**.\nUniting with the turning of Heaven and Earth without knowing,\npassing with the sun and moon without awareness—\nthus its attainment is great and enduring.\n\nIf one follows the principle of the **Great Polarity** (*Taiji*),\nharmonizing with the constant of yin and yang,\nand endures prolonged cultivation—\nwhen **lead** and **fire** are fully refined,\nwithstanding nine winters of cold;\nwhen the **elixir** is solidified and settled,\nforgotten after three cycles—\nis this not what the **Supreme Sage** meant by\n*\"agitation overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat\"*?\n\nWhen clarity and purity reside within,\nwhen **emptiness** and **spirit** are unobstructed,\nreturning to the **mysterious and tranquil Heaven**,\nembodying the **harmonious and peaceful**—\nwhat agitation, what cold, what stillness, what heat remains?\n\nThe scholar cultivates a **quiet and still** mind,\ntransforming the seasons of cold and heat,\nand thus the **true qi** of the body solidifies—\nthe **true Dao** of the world is established.\nWhat need is there to fear the proliferation of **heterodox paths**?\n\nThis is the **Dao** in its utmost **plainness** and **constancy**,\nits utmost **emptiness** and **nothingness**.\nBefore one attains the realm of **emptiness** and **nothingness**,\nwithin the domain of the **ordinary**—\none only feels **fullness**, not **deficiency**;\none only feels **advantage**, not **shortcoming**.\n\nThus the **Supreme Sage** said:\n*\"The less one has, the more one gains;\nthe more one has, the more confused one becomes.\"*\nThe proverb states:\n*\"A great bell makes no sound;\na full jar makes no echo.\"*\nTruly not false.\n\n**Great virtue** is not virtue—\nthus it is virtue;\n**great action** is non-action—\nthus it is action.\nNot mere modest words.\n\nThe **Dao** originates from **emptiness** and **qi** as one.\nBecause one has **attainment**, there is **no attainment**;\nbecause one has **no attainment**, that is **true attainment**.\nThus, the higher the **Dao**,\nthe lower the heart;\nthe greater the **virtue/power**,\nthe more humble the will—\nthis alone aligns with the **Dao** perfectly.\n\nIf one has even a slight excess,\none boasts arrogantly, proud and haughty,\ncontemptuous of others, domineering—\nthen the absence of **Dao** and **virtue/power** is evident.\n\nThus the **Supreme Sage** said:\n*\"In learning, one gains daily;\nin the **Dao**, one diminishes daily—\ndiminish again, diminish,\nuntil one reaches **nothingness**.\"*\nOnly then does one attain.\n\nThe scholar must not view **cultivating the Dao** and **refining the elixir**\nlike the arts of a hundred craftsmen,\nassuming progress if it seems beneficial.\nIf **cultivation** is rooted in **emptiness**,\nand the **work** reaches **forgetting**—\nthis is progress.\nWhen **forgetting** is forgotten,\none has entered the realm of **transformation**.\n\nFor the scholar of the **Dao**,\nretreat is advancement,\nweakness is strength.\n**Emptiness** becomes **fullness**,\n**non-action** becomes **action**,\n**reversal** is **uprightness**,\n**subtraction** is **increase**.\nThus, the progress or stagnation of learning\ndepends solely on whether the heart has **forgotten** or not.\n\n---\n**Chapter 46: When the World Has the Dao**\n\nWhen the world has the **Dao**,\nwarhorses are driven out to manure fields.\nWhen the world lacks the **Dao**,\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo crime is greater than **desire**,\nno calamity greater than **insatiability**.\nNo fault is greater than **greed**.\n\nThus, **contentment** is **contentment**—\n**contentment** is always **contentment**.\n\nWhen the world has the **Dao**,\nrulers and people alike are at ease.\nConquest and warfare are unnecessary,\nso horses are released into the forests,\nfields are plowed and tilled,\nmerely to fertilize the land.\n\nWhen the world lacks the **Dao**,\nchaos has already taken root.\nBandits and thieves rise in succession,\nweapons clash daily—\nwithout armies, how could peace be maintained?\nThus, warhorses are raised in the wilds,\nawaiting the state’s needs.\n\nThe rise and fall of horses\ndepend on whether the world has the **Dao** or not—\ntheir fate is bound to the world’s great order.\n\nAlas!\nHow could we have rulers as rulers,\nministers as ministers,\nfathers as fathers,\nsons as sons—\nupholding **ren** and discussing **righteousness**,\ncherishing **poetry** and explaining **rites**,\nrestoring the **Dao** of the **Great Peace**?\n\nYet in times of enduring peace and prosperity,\nluxury and indulgence flourish,\ndesires multiply, and greed emerges.\nHaving this, yet lacking that—\nexotic skills and decadent arts\nare arrayed before them.\n\nFine clothes and delicious food are insufficient,\nso they crave palatial chambers and jade terraces.\nA thousand-*li* domain seems too narrow,\nand they covet the vastness of ten-thousand-*li* borders.\n\nAlas!\nWithin, **lust** runs rampant;\nwithout, **debauchery** spreads.\nAdding to this is the pursuit of profit and haste,\nexhausting military might and reckless warfare,\nendless demands and insatiable greed—\ninternal and external chaos ensues.\nWhat need is there for waiting for ruin?\n\nAll this stems from a single **desire** at its origin.\nWhen **desire** arises, **greed** is born;\nwhen **greed** is born, one seeks what is not yet obtained,\nand fears losing what is already possessed.\nIf this continues,\n**principles** remain unbroken,\n**calamities** do not arise,\nthe state does not collapse,\nthe world does not face annihilation—\nthis is impossible.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"No crime is greater than **desire**.\"*\nIf there were no **desire**,\nhow could **greed** arise?\nIf **greed** does not arise,\nthen the winds of **deceitful harmony, deceitful completion, and deceitful beauty**\nwould not easily reappear.\n\nIt is also said:\n*\"No calamity is greater than **insatiability**.\"*\nIf a person’s **desire** does not arise,\nthis **will** is always satisfied,\nthis **heart** is always at ease,\nneeding nothing from the world,\nharming no one.\nWhen things go well, one accepts them;\nwhen things go ill, one accepts them as well—\nfrom where would **calamity** arise?\n\nAgain, it is said:\n*\"No fault is greater than **greed**.\"*\nIf one knows **contentment**,\none naturally guards one’s **portion** and accepts one’s **fate**,\nfollowing the **times** and listening to **Heaven**,\nwithout flattery or arrogance,\nwithout strife or seizure—\nwalking the **straight and easy path**,\nlong basking in the **Great Harmony**—\nwhat **fault** could there be?\n\n「How much more so when the true heart is inwardly clear,\nand the true nature inwardly settled,\nwhen one cultivates oneself in stillness,\nalways finds joy within,\nand follows one’s innate station without conforming to the external world.\n\nThose who hold the **Dao/Way** of the world naturally preserve their world;\nthose who hold a state naturally preserve their state;\nthose who hold life naturally preserve their life.\nWhat they fear is that once the **desire** arises,\nthey cannot cut it off and eliminate it,\nultimately reaching **extreme extravagance** and **unbridled greed**,\nyet finding no way to save themselves.\n\nIs there a **Dao/Way** to **desire** the world and obtain it?\nFrom ancient times, the fate of **gain** and **loss** depends on a single thought.\nA single thought, once set in motion, is difficult to reverse—\nthus, vast calamity is born.\nThis is how a **misguided thought** leads to a **catastrophe** of unimaginable scale.\n\nLife and death hang by a thread,\na slender chance.\nIf one can preserve this slender chance,\none will surely open a **vast and auspicious plan**.\nThis is how a **resolute thought** brings endless blessings.\n\nThus, one must know:\nA single thought of **desire**,\nthough its beginning may be slight,\nits end is great—\ncan one not be cautious?\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"**Contentment**, **contentment**, always **contentment**.\"*\nThose who do not know **contentment**,\nthe more they seek, the more they lose,\nand the more they lose, the more they seek.\nThus, they exhaust their strength and weary their spirit,\nendlessly toiling and laboring—\nwhat benefit is there in this?\n\nDo they not know that **prosperity** and **adversity**, **gain** and **loss**,\nare governed by **Heaven**,\nnot by human effort?\nWhy toil and weary oneself daily,\nwhen it is better to rest and let things be as they are?\n\nIf one knows **contentment**,\nthey follow their natural state,\nacting without contrivance—\nwhat need for worry or concern?\nWithout scheming or seeking,\nwhere would they go without attaining what is good?\nLet people take heed of this!」\n\n「This likens the world to the human body,\nand compares the horse to using fire to refine elixirs.\n\nIf a person possesses the **Dao/Way**,\nthen their vital essence is abundant and their **qi** is full—\nwhy bother refining elixirs?\nTo follow and preserve it naturally is sufficient.\n\nIf they lack the **Dao/Way**,\nthen their essence is depleted and their **qi** dissipates,\nand they must resort to nurturing their body and mind with the **elemental spirit** (*yuánshén*) and **true breath** (*zhēnxī*).\nBut at the outset of practice,\nthey must first cultivate externally,\nhence the saying:\n*\"**Steed of war** is born in the wilderness.\"*\nWhen their vitality flourishes and the medicine takes effect,\nthey then proceed with the **fire-alchemy** (*huǒdān*), **retreat of the elixir** (*tuìdān*), and **warding-off formulas** (*fǎ*)—\nmethods of **field combat** (*yězhàn*) and **defending the city** (*shǒuchéng*).\nThey gather all into the furnace,\nslowly warming and nourishing.\n\nWhen impurities are fully purged\nand pure radiance arises,\nthe world is once again at peace,\nthe state without strife,\nand the horse returns to **Mount Hua**,\nhence the saying:\n*\"**Drive the steed back** to till the fields.\"*\nYet the chaos of the world\nand the peril of one’s own life\nall stem from a single moment of **desire** (*yù*).\nIf not cut off,\nit festers and grows unseen,\nuntil the vital essence is exhausted,\nand life and body cannot be preserved—\nhow tragic is this?\n\nWhenever **desire** arises in a person,\nthey must seek to fulfill it before finding satisfaction.\nEven if all things go as they wish,\nhow can the **abyss of desire** be filled?\nHow can **greed** and **covetousness** be sated?\nOnce they have **the Rampart Pass** (*Lǒng*), they gaze upon **Mount Shu** (*Shù*)—\nendlessly turning, never ceasing—\nthose who hold the world lose the world,\nand those who possess life and body,\nhow could they not forfeit their very lives?\n\nThe *Shijing* says:\n*\"Without scheming or seeking,\nwhy should they go without attaining what is good?\"*\n\nOnly those who know **contentment** can dwell in tranquility,\nconstantly abiding in the **Dao/Way**-aligned realm of Heaven.\nThey need no **meritorious deeds** to mend their flaws,\nbut simply follow their natural course,\nunifying with Heaven itself.\n\nThe **Supreme Sage** (*Tàishàng*) warns:\n*\"No sin is greater than **desire**\"*—\nthese three words teach one to **block the source** (*dùjiān*) and **guard against the subtle** (*fángwēi*), cautioning against the **deceit of seeking** (*qīqiú*) and the **labor of contrivance** (*jiāo láo*).\nThis is the same teaching as Confucian **\"solemn vigilance\"** (*shèndú*) and Buddhist **\"right awakening\"** (*zhèngjué*).\n\nHave scholars ever grasped this truth?\n**Chapter Forty-Seven: *The Uncontrived Attainment* (*Bùwéi ér chéng*)」\n\nTo dwell within yet know the world beyond,\nto gaze not through windows yet perceive the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\nThe farther one roams, the less one knows—\nthus the **Supreme Sage** acts without action, names without seeing, achieves without doing.\n\nThe **virtuous** (*junzi*) possesses all things within,\nyet without stepping beyond his courtyard refines his being.\nThe shifts of the world, the changes of hearts,\nand the mechanisms of preserving life while extinguishing ruin,\nof reversing chaos into order—\nall are crystal-clear within his mind.\nIs this achieved through mere craft or calculation?\nTruly, for **qi** and self share a single source:\nto exhaust the logic of one’s own nature\nis to encompass the logic of all under Heaven.\nThus, one knows the world without leaving home.\n\nThe ancients shaped creation through mind alone,\nwithout opening windows to conceal their radiance,\nyet the silent **Emperor** (*Dì*) and the ceaseless **Heavenly Mandate** (*Tiānmìng*)\nand the mysteries of growth, decline, and transformation—\nall are fully illuminated within.\nIs this gained through mere conjecture?\nIt is because **Heaven and humanity are one continuum** (*tiānrén yīguàn*):\nto cultivate one’s own life\nis to align with the **Heavenly Command** (*Tiānmìng*).\nThus, one perceives the **Dao/Way** of Heaven without peering through windows.\n\nIf one wanders distant lands, inquiring into the world’s affairs,\nor consorts with noble friends, probing the subtleties of **Heavenly Mandate**—\none may gain some knowledge.\nBut I fear that if one seeks knowledge outside oneself,\nrather than within,\none’s understanding, though gained, will be lesser than what lies near.\nHence it is said:\n*\"The farther one goes, the less one knows.\"*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** shines brightly between doors and windows—\nwhy abandon what is near to chase what is far?\nMencius said:\n*\"Speaking near yet pointing far is good speech;\nupholding brevity while applying broadly is good **Dao/Way**.\"*\nReflecting thus, the more one studies, the nearer yet farther it becomes,\nthe more concise yet expansive it grows—\nhow can the near and the concise be neglected?\n\nThus the **Supreme Sage** embraces **Oneness** (*yī*), containing the three,\nobserving emptiness while cultivating stillness,\nnever leaving his door or hut,\nnever treading the dusty markets,\ndwelling among wood and stone,\nroaming with deer and swine,\nnot moving a step, not befriending a soul—\nyet it seems lonely.\nBut when the spirit is settled, wisdom arises;\nthough he does not act, his deeds surpass those who do.\nThough he lacks knowledge, his insight surpasses those who know.\nCommon folk take what they see as their pursuit,\nbut the **Sage** does not seek what is seen—\nthus, day and night, he remains steadfast (*qiánqián*),\nresting thought and abandoning artifice\nin the unseen and unheard,\nguarding against deceit and contrivance in the unmanifest.\nWith only inner knowing and no outward perception—\nit seems as if in utter darkness—\nyet the **Ultimate** (*Wújí*) gives rise to life.\nThough unseen, it is ever manifest;\nthough unnamed, it is ever present.\n\nAs for the myriad beings of the world,\nthe hidden realms of spirits and ghosts—\nall are governed by this **Uncontrived** **Dao/Way**.\nWith order and essence,\nbeginning and ending are fulfilled.\nWhat is feared is being ensnared by perception,\nclinging to names and forms,\nboasting of achievements,\nhoarding insights—\nthus the mind scatters, unable to unify in **virtue** (*dé*).\nThe heart becomes cluttered, unlike the **Great Void** (*Tàixū*).\nHence the **Dao/Way** fails to manifest, and **virtue** remains unchanged.\nNo wonder one exhausts oneself in vain across lifetimes, gaining nothing.\n\nIf applied to governing the world,\none cannot harmonize with **Heavenly Principle** (*lǐ*) to achieve natural unity—\nwithout action, the world would spontaneously align.\nIf applied to cultivating the self,\none cannot refine the **Void** and merge with the **Dao/Way**—\nwithout action, the body would naturally attain true transformation.\nWhat use is mere external seeking?\n\nThus the **virtuous** must be ever vigilant in solitude,\nfor the essence of humanity and the origin of **Heavenly Mandate**\nlie in what is sought yet naturally known.\nThis speaks of the **Dao/Way** taking **Uncontrived** as its foundation,\n**solemn vigilance** as its key—\nthus, **Uncontrived** yet nothing remains undone,\n**Unknowing** yet nothing remains unknown.\nYet this is not the **Uncontrived** of withered wood and dead ashes.\nEarlier, I spoke of *\"all phenomena as emptiness, one spirit alone illuminating\"*—\nthis is the true intent;\nand *\"one awakening sets motion in motion, one **Yang** gives rise to life\"*—\nthis is the **Original Qi** (*yuánqì*).\nGathering medicine or refining elixirs\nis but the cultivation of these two—**nature** (*xìng*) and **life** (*mìng*).\nWithout true intent, where would **nature** depend?\nWithout true **qi**, how could **life** be refined?\nTo gather true intent with true **qi**,\nwhen the two merge into one,\nit returns to the **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*)’s beginning—\nthis is called the **Elixir** (*dān*).\n\nWithin **Uncontrived**, there must still be action and doing;\nwithin **Unknowing**, there must still be knowing and awareness—\nonly then does one not fall into emptiness or cling to form.\nWhen cultivation deepens, emptiness becomes form,\nand form becomes emptiness.\nIn time, both are forgotten,\nand one merges seamlessly with **Dao/Way**—\nthus attaining its utmost harmony.\n\nIf one does not know the **Dao/Way** of humanity,\none may still perceive the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\nConfucius said:\n*\"How does Heaven speak?\nThe four seasons proceed, and all things are born\"*—\nthis is the essence of **Uncontrived**.\n\nThis is the **Supreme Dao/Way**.\n**Uncontrived** is **Heavenly Nature** (*tiānxìng*),\n**Action** is **Heavenly Mandate** (*tiānmìng*);\n**Unknowing** is the **Original Spirit** (*yuánshén*),\n**Awareness** is the **Original Qi** (*yuánqì*).\nBetween Heaven and Earth, there must be both two and one\nto achieve transformation—\nboth divine and not divine,\nnot divine yet divine—\nthus attaining the marvel of **Oneness** within duality,\ndivinity within transformation.\nThis cannot be exhausted by words.\nIt lies with you, the cultivator:\nnurture the **Void** and the **Spiritual** (*xūlíng*),\nconstantly guard the **Void** and the **Awakened** (*xūxǐng*).\nThus **nature** and **life** endure,\nand the **Great Dao/Way** may be fulfilled.\n\nDo not confuse **Uncontrived** with **Action**—\neach side taken in isolation,\nthough seemingly orthodox,\nleads to divergent paths.\nConsider this well.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight: *Daily Diminishing for the Dao/Way, Daily Increasing for Learning* (*Wéidào rì sǔn, wéixué rì yì*)**\n\nTo take the world requires **Uncontrived**—\nyet when affairs arise, it is insufficient to take the world.\nScholars memorize texts and master arts,\nvaluing teachers and friends,\nseeking much and hearing much—\nonly then do thoughts flourish and wisdom emerge.\n\nThe knowing grows ever broader, the deeds ever more abundant—\nonly then can one wield the brush to compose with ease,\nor swing the axe to shape with mastery.\nThus it is said: *\"To cultivate learning is to daily increase.\"*\n\nBut for the Dao/Way, the reverse holds true.\nIf one takes wide reading and mastery of ancient texts as their pursuit,\nyet fails to turn inward, to self-reflection and single-minded guarding,\nthen though their knowledge expands and insights multiply,\ntheir mind will scatter and their spirit grow chaotic.\nThough learning increases, the Dao/Way diminishes—\nuntil, in time, they are lost in the undifferentiated *Taiji*,\ndrowned in the boundless, with nothing remaining.\n\nThus the cultivator of the Dao/Way must proceed like peeling a banana leaf or unraveling silk—\nthe more they strip away, the less remains;\nthe more they draw forth, the more it vanishes,\nuntil they reach the realm of *wu-wu* (non-being of non-being).\nOnly then have they attained it.\n\nWhen cultivation reaches this stage,\nnaturally the divine and mysterious become unfathomable,\ntransformations boundless:\nwhen gathered, it is present;\nwhen dispersed, it is absent.\nDesire one, and it is one;\ndesire ten thousand, and it is ten thousand.\nThe sun, moon, and stars revolve at my command;\nwinds, clouds, thunder, and rain obey my orchestration.\nWhat greater power is there?\n\nYet scholars, taking one principle and discarding another,\nlike eating sugarcane—\nonce consumed, it is cast aside—\nstill return to nothingness.\nThus it is said: *\"To cultivate the Dao/Way is to daily diminish,\ndiminish again and again, until reaching Uncontrived—\nUncontrived, yet nothing remains undone.\"*\n\nObserve those who seek to take the world:\nthey cannot avoid raising armies and mobilizing troops,\nbrandishing weapons and comparing blades—\nhow could they remain in *wu-wu*?\nYet even amid affairs, they must return to *wu-wu*,\nlest their mind and virtue scatter,\nand their strategies fail to emerge.\nThus commanders issue stern orders:\ntheir ears hear nothing external,\ntheir eyes see nothing external,\ntheir heart wanders to no external schemes—\nonly then can they respond with spontaneity,\nand take the world as effortlessly as turning the palm.\n\nOtherwise, chaos reigns—\nthe more affairs multiply, the more the mind is disordered;\nthe more disordered, the more the spirit grows dim.\nBefore the enemy even arrives, they cannot remain composed;\nat the first clash, their ranks dissolve into confusion.\nTo hope for victory in such a battle is surely difficult.\nWhat then of pacifying the eastern barbarians while the western nomads rise anew—\none crisis unresolved, another erupting—\nif they do not know to remain still to govern movement,\nor rest to await exertion,\nfew escape defeat and ruin.\nAnciently, those who fled in defeat,\nwhose cities fell in ruin,\nall succumbed to the perils of *having affairs*.\n\nThus military strategy employs tactics of surprise and ambush.\nWhen the enemy sees banners filling the horizon,\ntrees trembling as soldiers,\neven facing overwhelming odds,\ntheir courage shatters—\nnone dare stand their ground.\nOnly by treating affairs as though they were nonexistent,\ncasting aside all entanglements,\nand maintaining single-minded inner illumination—\nlike Zhuge Liang amidst a million troops,\nhis headgear and fan untroubled,\neffortlessly at ease—\ncould he preserve the western Shu,\nprolonging the Han’s survival in its hour of peril.\nHad his mind been entangled in affairs,\nhis inner clarity would have faltered,\nhis spirit lost its master—\nlike Xu Shu, distracted by his mother’s return to Cao Cao,\nunable to offer further counsel,\nand thus failing to aid the emperor in restoring the realm.\nHow could such a one take the world?\n\nThis speaks to those cultivating the Dao/Way:\nif they see only increase, not diminution,\ntheir mind grows clouded and the Dao/Way fails to coalesce.\nThus it is said: *\"Virtue/power is singular—\nwhen divided into two or three, it grows dim.\"*\nOnly by refining and forgetting in turn,\nforgetting and refining anew,\ncan they avoid becoming obstacles to the Dao/Way.\nIf memories persist, clamoring without cease,\nthey become the true concern of our path.\nThus they must gradually dissolve and vanish into absolute nothingness—\nonly then is *xing* (nature) fully realized.\n\nThen, from nothingness, true being arises,\nand one can move unseen among ghosts and spirits,\ntransformations beyond measure.\nThe text speaks of *\"the world\"* as a metaphor for the Dao/Way,\n*\"taking the world\"* as cultivating it,\n*\"having affairs\"* and *\"no affairs\"* as *having-for* and *Uncontrived*.\nIf one remains pure and Uncontrived,\nthey are in harmony with the primordial *qi*—\nwhat difficulty is there in attaining the Dao/Way?\nThis is the essence of *taking the world*.\n\nBut if they manipulate *having-for*,\nentirely relying on later-heaven exertion,\nthey fall into tangential paths—\nthis is the opposite of *taking the world*.\n\nSome may ask: *\"How can gathering herbs or refining elixirs be Uncontrived?\"*\nKnow this: when *qi* ascends, follow its ascent—\nnot by first intending to ascend.\nWhen *qi* descends, follow its descent—\nnot by first intending to descend.\nEven if gathering is exhaustive,\nif refining is manifold,\nit is still pure spontaneity,\nwith not a trace of contrivance—\nthough it appears as *having-for*, it remains *Uncontrived*.\nThose who merely swallow saliva or inhale *qi*\nare far from attaining the elixir or the Dao/Way.\n\n---\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: *The Sage Has No Fixed Mind* (*Shèng wú chángxīn*)**\n\nThe sage has no fixed mind,\nbut takes the minds of the people as their own.\nTo the virtuous, they are virtuous;\nto the unvirtuous, they are also virtuous—\nthus their virtue is perfect.\nTo the trustworthy, they are trustworthy;\nto the untrustworthy, they are also trustworthy—\nthus their trust is perfect.\nThe sage moves among the people,\nblending their heart with the world’s,\nas though it were their own.\n\nThe people fix their ears and eyes upon the sage,\nyet the sage treats them like children.\nThe sage’s mind is vast and hollow,\nclear and luminous—\nit contains all things without exclusion,\nyet illuminates all things without attachment—\nlike a still mirror reflecting light,\nits radiance unfailing.\nIt adapts to each thing as it arises,\nwithout a trace of preconception—\nhow profound is its clarity!\nThe great encompasses all without limit,\nthe small is contained without omission—\nbeauty and ugliness, good and evil,\nnone escape its embrace—\nhow boundless is its capacity!\n\nYet what mind is this?\nNeither forced nor contrary to nature—\nthus it is said: *\"The sage has no fixed mind.\"*\nMeaning the sage does not anticipate before arrival,\nnor cling after departure,\nnor linger in the present—\nmerely responding to each situation as it arises,\nadapting to circumstances,\nand taking the minds of the people as their own.\n\nAnd what mind do the people have?\nOnly to love what is good and hate what is evil.\n\nThus the sage rewards and encourages the people’s goodness,\nwhile guiding and nurturing even their faults.\nGoodness and fault alike—\nthe sage embraces them all with boundless virtue and measure.\nSo the good are joyfully drawn toward virtue,\nwhile the faulty spontaneously turn from vice to righteousness—\nthis is the **\"virtue of goodness.\"**\nWhen the ruler cherishes goodness, the people dare not fail to follow.\nThe response is inevitable—\nits mechanism unfailing.\n\nThe sage reveres and honors those of faith,\nwhile loving and longing for even the faithless.\nFaith and doubt alike—\nthe sage encompasses them both with unshaken sincerity.\nSo the faithful find harmony and deepen their trust,\nwhile the doubtful rise resolute and turn doubt into faith—\nthis is the **\"virtue of sincerity.\"**\nWhen the ruler cherishes sincerity, the people dare not fail to act in truth.\nTheir reciprocal bond—\nhow divine its reach!\n\nWhen the people’s virtue grows thick,\nwhat doubt remains?\n\nSince all share this heart,\nand this heart shares this principle,\nthe sage observes myriad minds with a single mind,\nharmonizes myriad principles with one principle.\nThough the world be vast, it is contained by sincerity;\nthough the people be many, they are gathered by righteousness.\nEven among the wise and deceitful, the loyal and false—\nhowever unequal they may be—\nthe sage is impartial, treating all with equal kindness.\nWith open sincerity and public fairness,\nplacing his heart before theirs,\nhe unifies the world under one principle—\nand the people daily improve without knowing it.\nHow profound is this transformation beyond mere teaching!\nHow could later methods—\nexhorting filial piety, urging loyalty,\ndemonstrating rites and righteousness—\never compare?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"He blends the world’s hearts in tranquil unity.\"*\n\nFor he views the world as one family,\nunites all under heaven as one body—\nhis compassion all-embracing,\nhis unity with the people complete.\nThus the people revere his virtue, embrace his kindness,\nlove him as parents, honor him as a deity,\nlook to him as teacher and guardian.\nAll they hear or see is measured against the sage’s voice and bearing—\nnothing else exists in their awareness.\nHence it is said:\n*\"The people fix their ears and eyes upon him.\"*\n\nIf the people’s expectation of the sage is thus,\nwhat else could the sage be but—\ngoverning the multitude with gentleness,\nleading them with tenderness,\nlike parents to children:\nwhether wise or foolish, virtuous or base,\nhis love is equal;\nhis guidance sincere.\n\nIf such governance fails to transform the world,\nit has never been.\n\nThus is the way of **non-action**.\n\nCompared to those who rely on speech and law,\nthe difference is as vast as heaven and earth.\n\nIn the *Classic*, **\"the sage\"** signifies the heart,\n**\"the world\"** signifies the body.\nThe sage’s cultivation of self\ndoes not exceed nurturing the **original spirit** and **original qi**.\n\nYet humans possess an original spirit and a mundane spirit;\noriginal qi and mundane qi.\nAt the outset, how could one avoid stray thoughts\nor fail to stir mundane breath?\nOnly those who understand for long\nsee the original spirit emerge.\nIf I meet them with an even mind—\neven if stray thoughts linger,\nI still meet them with an even mind.\nIf the original spirit fails to appear,\nit has never been.\n\nOnce the original spirit arises,\ncultivation has its master—\nthen one must quietly guard the **elixir field**,\nnurturing the original qi.\nIf the original qi moves of its own accord,\nI meet it with harmonious breath—\neven if mundane breath does not yet cease,\nI still meet it with harmonious breath.\nIf the original qi fails to generate,\nit will not.\n\nKnow this:\nThe original spirit is obscured by the mundane spirit,\nlike a bright mirror long sealed by dust—\nunless diligently polished, how could it suddenly shine?\nThe original qi is drowned by mundane breath,\nlike white silk stained by oil—\nunless thoroughly cleansed, how could it return to purity?\nYet if at this point a restless mind arises,\nor an evil thought stirs,\nyou seek the original spirit as essence,\nwhile the mundane mind only grows stronger.\nTo seek enlightenment—\nis it not difficult?\nTo seek the original qi as master,\nwhile mundane breath only intensifies—\nhow could this be easy?\n\nYet the sage’s governance of the world\ndoes not distinguish good from evil, true from false—\nhe treats all with a single heart of kindness and sincerity:\nthe good he affirms as good,\nthe evil he also affirms as good;\nthe faithful he affirms as faithful,\nthe faithless he also affirms as faithful.\nA childlike purity, complete in his embrace.\nThis is the **void**, this is the **Way**.\nFrom the void, spirit naturally arises;\nfrom the Way, qi naturally flows.\nThings unfold spontaneously, without contrivance.\nOtherwise, if the heart is not void,\nthe Way does not yet exist—\nhow could the spirit then manifest,\nor the Way’s qi endure?\n\nCultivating self and governing the world—\nthe Way is one, the principle is singular.\nTo know governance is to know self-cultivation;\nto grasp external causes is to grasp inner truth.\nThus, using this principle to illustrate,\nits instruction to learners is profound and direct.\n\nThe student must diligently guard the true and constant,\nskillfully nurture the void—\nthen the original spirit and original qi\nwill naturally return.\n\nIf a stray thought arises,\nor a foreign breath stirs,\nfear that the more you cultivate, the farther the Way recedes.\nLet the student beware!\n\n**Chapter Fifty: The Depth of Generative Generativity**\nBirth and death.\nThose who cling to life—thirteen in ten;\nthose who cling to death—thirteen in ten;\nthose who, in living, tread death’s path—thirteen in ten.\nWhy so?\nBecause of their excessive attachment to life.\n\nThe art of nurturing life is such that\none who walks the land meets no rhinoceros or tiger,\nand one who enters battle is unharmed by weapons or blades.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to strike with its horn,\nthe tiger no place to extend its claws,\nthe blade no place to lodge its edge.\nHow so?\nBecause there is no place of death within them.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate all things—\nthough myriad transformations and changes occur without end,\ntheir Way remains within one yin and one yang alone,\nswelling and waning, advancing and retreating, preserving and perishing.\nBetween them, too, lies nothing but the flow of *taiji* principle and qi.\n\nLife and death are like day and night—\ncycling endlessly, ceaseless in their motion,\njust as life and death cycle, alternating without pause.\nYet within this flexing and returning,\nthe interplay is inherently dual, without deviation.\n\nSpeaking of those who enter and exit birth and death:\nthree in ten thrive when encountering yang qi,\nthree in ten perish when meeting yin qi.\nEven those who, against Heaven and Earth’s constant yin-yang,\ngain life from yang, are no different from others.\nOnce born, knowledge unfolds, desires arise,\nworldly cravings stir, and actions multiply—\nthus they exhaust their essence, deplete their spirit,\nshorten their years, and lose their lives—\nthese are the three in ten who court death’s domain.\n\nThus, the tally of life does not match that of death;\nthe workings of yin exceed those of yang.\nDoes the generative principle of *zào huà* fear exhaustion?\nYet the primal *taiji* is soundless, scentless—\nmoving, it generates yang; still, it generates yin.\nIt manifests as the Five Phases,\nscatters as myriad things,\nexhausting all oddities, beyond speech,\nyet never lacking.\n\nThus, to follow it brings endless life;\nto defy it leads to return to the source.\nWhen life is extinguished, death is renewed;\nwhen death is stilled, life stirs anew—\nthis is the Way of *zào huà*’s interdependence,\nthe virtue of ghosts and gods in utmost sincerity,\nembedded from primordial beginnings to this day,\nunchanged.\n\nWere it otherwise, all things would live without dying,\nand the teeming multitude would fill the cosmos—\nHeaven and Earth would lack space to contain them,\nand the mechanism of generation would falter.\nIt is the ebbing that rests the swelling,\nthe voiding that preserves the full—\nthis is how the principle of life endures.\n\nIf one understands the depth of Heaven and Earth’s generativity,\nit lies in this ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness.\nThus, observing Heaven’s Way, holding to Heaven’s course,\none seeks life’s pulse amid death’s mechanisms,\nand breathes vitality from death’s grasp.\nFollowing the seasons’ orders—\nspring’s growth, summer’s fullness, autumn’s harvest, winter’s storage—\nembracing the functions of generation, flourishing, contraction, and repose,\nthose who align with Heaven’s order and reverse its application\nare like Heaven and Earth, nurturing all things\nto sustain an unobstructed cosmos for ten thousand years;\nwhile the human body, returning to its root and origin,\nbecomes a saint beyond compare through the ages—\nall this stems from this very principle.\n\nThis is not the task of the feeble-minded.\nOnly those skilled in nurturing life\nemploy the inverted laws of yin-yang,\nthe counteractive methods of *zào huà*—\ndescending to ascend, advancing to retreat;\nin stillness, observing effortlessly; in motion, awaiting yang’s birth;\nurgently propelling the *dòu* handle, leisurely guarding the *yào* furnace;\nreturning to *taiji*, restoring to utmost sincerity;\nemerging with entry, enduring with exit—\nthroughout the ages, unchanging;\nharmonizing with sun and moon, uniting with Heaven and Earth…\nThus, even when confronting great peril,\nthey emerge unscathed.\nEven the fierce tiger or rhinoceros\nbecome companions;\neven the sharpest blades\ndissolve into nothingness.\nWhy fear the rhinoceros’ horn, the tiger’s claws,\nor the blade’s strike,\nand calculate life and death in an instant?\nHow is this possible?\nBecause they dwell in no place of death.\n\n「And what of the Sage who refines their nature and establishes their life’s purpose over years?\nWhen gathered, they take form; when dispersed, they become *qi*.\nThe sun and moon revolve at my command,\nThe winds and thunders obey my bidding.\n\nThough the tiger and rhinoceros rage fiercely,\nAnd blades though sharp and weapons though mighty,\nHow can they reach the *formed*?\nOnly the *formless* can subdue the *formed*—\nHow can the *formed* ever constrain the *formless*?\n\nAlas! All things with form have birth and death,\nBut the Sage, formless, transcends birth and death—\nIndeed, they master the primal source of life and death.\nTo all things, this appears as birth and death,\nYet who would dare to harm them?\nThis is the tenfold fullness of Heaven and Earth,\nThe threefold interplay of three yang and three yin.\n\nHumans inherit the three yang of *Buqian* (乾) and meet the three yin of *Bunkun* (坤) at death.\nThis is the eternal principle of Heaven and Earth—\nOne yin and one yang, bending and stretching,\nComing and going, cyclically interdependent.\nWithout yin, there is no yang;\nWithout death, there is no life.\n\nThus, retreat and concealment are but ways\nTo nurture the profound *virtue/power* of life’s continuity.\nYet in abandoning themselves to passion and desire,\nDestroying principle and losing their humanity,\nTheir death differs from others—\nFor those who follow yin-yang’s order,\nAre embraced by *Taiji*’s undifferentiated wholeness,\nAnd move with the true *qi* of the two polarities.\n\nBut those who defy *zào huà*’s methods—\nTheir original *yuánqì* (元气) is lost,\nAnd they succumb to excessive *yīnxié* (阴邪).\nHence they say, *“Ten and three”* (十有三).\n\nTen is the fullness, the Dao’s embrace of Heaven and Earth;\nThree is Heaven’s One generating Water, Earth’s Two generating Fire,\nHeaven One and Earth Two merging into Water and Fire’s trio.\nMoreover, Heaven’s One generates Water,\nMetal is born from Water;\nEarth’s Two generates Fire,\nWood is born from Fire—\nThus the four *xiàng* (象) are complete.\n\nSoil has no fixed place,\nRoaming through the four *xiàng*,\nAnd when the purest essence of *Taiji* rules\nThe *qi* of yin-yang,\nAnd governs the mechanisms of *zào huà*,\nIt becomes *Wújí* (无极) in Heaven and Earth.\n\nYet in the human body, *Taiji*’s principle reveals itself:\nAt rest, as the *yuánshén* (元神) of silence and scentlessness, undivided;\nIn motion, as the *liángzhīliángnéng* (良知良能) of timely action and true intention—\nTogether, they form the *Wǔxíng* (五行).\n\nThis is the shared *virtue/power* of life’s continuity,\nIn all things—when present, it dwells in them;\nWhen absent, it returns to the boundless *Tàixū* (太虚).\nIt neither increases nor decreases with life and death of beings.\n\nThus the adept at preserving life,\nEntering their chamber to meditate in stillness,\nCaptures the moment when one yang returns,\nHolding it to ascend, to descend,\nAnd to return to the furnace for nourishment—\nNinefold transformations of the elixir,\nTenfold perfection of the fire’s *candidate* (候).\n\n“High is the Dao, and dragons and tigers submit;\nGreat is *virtue/power*, and spirits grow tender”—\nWhat harm can the tiger’s horn, the rhinoceros’ claws,\nOr blades and weapons inflict?\n\nObserve the ancients:\nIn secluded mountain depths,\nRhinoceroses gathered in herds,\nWolves consorted in packs,\nYet willingly tamed, content to roam freely—\nNot a few such tales exist.\n\nOr lone horsemen charging forth,\nTribes surrendering their hearts,\nDiscarding armor, abandoning spears,\nRevering them as divine,\nLoving them like kin.\n\nAnd further still—\nFilial piety moving Heaven,\nBandits yielding sincerity;\nStrict virtue and chastity,\nCausing rogues to pause in guilt—\nAll from the *virtue/power* of utmost sincerity,\nWhich stirs them deeply.\n\nObserve again:\nThe rhinoceros cannot strike with its horn,\nThe tiger cannot place its claws,\nThe blade cannot find its target—\nThis is no false claim.\n\nFor the essence of *lǐqì* (理气) is not the yin-yang of *zào huà*.\nI can remain tranquil and serene,\nReaching the boundless light,\nYet what birth and death can touch me?\n\nThose who know birth and death are but traces;\nI can erase these traces,\nReturning to the undifferentiated fate,\nThe harmonious Heaven—\nThough traces of life and death persist,\nThe principle remains everlasting, unobstructed.\nWhy then rejoice in life’s fleeting pleasure,\nOr dread death’s inevitable sorrow?\n\nThe ancient Sages sacrificed life for righteousness,\nAnd died to fulfill *rén* (仁).\nTo them, the knife and saw were commonplace,\nAnd the cauldron’s boiling a trivial matter—\nWhy was this so?\nBecause they had attained the inner truth,\nAnd feared nothing externally.\n\nHence it is said, *“No place of death.”*\n\nMoreover, the fullness of Water is seven,\nCombined to make thirteen as well.\n**Chapter 51: Revering the Dao and Honoring Virtue/Power**\n\nThe Dao brings forth life,\n*Virtue/power* sustains it,\nThings take form through it,\nAnd circumstances perfect it.\nThus all things reverence the Dao\nAnd honor *virtue/power*.\n\nThe Dao’s reverence,\nThe *virtue/power*’s nobility—\nNone command them, yet they persist naturally.\nSo the Dao brings forth life,\n*Virtue/power* sustains it,\nNurtures and fosters it,\nPerfects and matures it,\nAnd nourishes it with care.\nLife is given yet not possessed,\nAction is done yet not relied upon,\nGrowth is guided yet not controlled—\nThis is called *mystic virtue/power*.\n\nThe Dao has no name,\nNo name means no limit.\nThis is the pure *qi* of emptiness,\nThe shared source of life’s continuity in Heaven, Earth, and all beings.\nFor it is neither having nor lacking,\nNeither vast nor small,\nYet encompasses all things without exception—\nHence it is called *“Great Virtue/Power.”*\n\nThe Dao is the *Taiji* shared by all things;\n*Virtue/power* is the *Taiji* inherent in each thing.\nThus all things draw life from it,\nRooted in the principle of the boundless void,\nThe *yuánqì* (元气) vast and all-pervading.\nNo matter great or small, hidden or revealed,\nAll depend on this Dao for life,\nAnd entrust their essence to its fate.\n\nWithin it, yin-yang harmonize their principles,\nAnd the sun and moon revolve in its depths—\nLike grasses and trees:\nResting in day and night,\nNourished by rain and dew,\nAnd thus strengthened at their roots.\n\nThis is the Dao bringing forth life,\nAnd *virtue/power* sustaining it.\nAll things, receiving this nurturing,\nAre transformed by its influence—\nFirst they take on *qi*,\nWith time they develop form.\nThus they grow secretly, steadily,\nDay by day, month by month,\nUntil humans become fully human,\nAnd things become fully what they are—\nWithout flaw or omission.\n\nThus all things reverence the Dao,\nAnd honor *virtue/power*.\nFor the Dao is the principle of life’s birth,\nWithout which there is no means to sustain life.\n\n*Virtue/power* is the source of nurturing all things—\nWithout it, there is no way to store and cultivate.\n\nHow great is the reverence for the Dao,\nAnd the honor for *virtue/power*?\nYet both are granted from Heaven,\nAnd take things as their occasion.\nNo need for forced action—\nNaturally aligned with the Way.\nWithout contrivance, effortlessly embodying *virtue/power*.\nNo one commands it, no one ordains it,\nYet ever thus—\nNothing compelled, all returns to the natural.\n\nWhat is this Dao?\nThe grand central path of Heaven and Earth,\nThe essential key for sages to attain immortality and enlightenment.\nIf one seeks to cultivate the Golden Immortal,\nHow else but through the Dao?\n\nThus, one concentrates the spirit in the void,\nUnites the *qi* in the boundless.\nAt the juncture of emptiness and stillness,\nIn the faint and obscure,\nThe primordial true *qi* emerges—\nThis is the birth of the Dao.\n\nOnce the Dao is born,\nThen nourish it in stillness,\nDraw from its motion;\nHold it straight within,\nAnd all phenomena dissolve into emptiness.\nEver grasp, ever preserve—\nDo not forget, do not abandon—\nThen the foundation of *virtue/power* is established.\n\nYet if one follows the Dao to bring it forth,\nThe Dao will grow daily;\nIf one relies on *virtue/power* to nurture it,\nThen *virtue/power* will flourish daily.\nTo grow and nurture—\nLike things thriving and multiplying,\nUntil autumn arrives and ripening is inevitable.\n\nWhen the Dao is thus complete and ripe,\nAnd its cultivation and protection continue—\nWhat difference is there from humanity?\n\nEssentially, it is but returning to the initial state before form,\nAnd restoring the undivided truth.\n\nIn truth, what is this \"life\"?\nIts life is the self-moving *qi* of the void.\nWhy claim it as mine to possess?\n\nEven when the signs of life appear—\nInternally circulating the Heavenly Canopy,\nExternally pushing the Dipper’s handle—\nIt seems like action,\nYet purely entrusted to nature,\nWithout the slightest arrogance or contrivance—\nIs this not effortless yet not relying on effort?\n\nTo cultivate thus,\n*Virtue/power* advances daily,\nThe Dao grows daily,\nAnd natural transformation lies within reach—\nHeaven and Earth governed by the mind—\nThough myriad changes arise,\nThey cannot disrupt the steadfastness of one who holds the essence.\n\nThis is the unruling ruler,\nExceeding all rulers—\nIs this not the profound and distant *virtue/power*?\n\nThis speaks of one who steals Heaven and Earth’s primordial *qi*\nAs the foundation for the elixir,\nThen nurtures, sustains, stores, and grows it,\nReturning to the original Heaven—\nThus attaining the Dao.\n\nYet to steal Heaven and Earth’s primordial *qi*,\nOne must first recognize the boundless gateway of the formless.\n\nWhere is this gateway?\nBefore Hongmeng’s division,\nAt the dawn of Heaven and Earth,\nIn the indistinct and chaotic—\nA sudden stirring,\nAnd the true mechanism moves of its own accord.\nThis is where the primordial *qi* resides,\nAnd the cultivator must gather it as the elixir’s seed.\n\nLike when the myriad yins congeal and close,\nAll things retreat and wither—\nYet when winter solstice’s yang returns,\nThe Dao is born.\n\nThus, one refines essence and preserves life,\nNurturing within the Eight Trigram Furnace.\nOver time, the *qi* swells and fills,\nLike all things flourishing in summer—\nThis is the accumulation.\n\nOnce things are full and ripe,\nFlowers bloom into fruit.\nLike autumn’s harvest of treasures complete.\n\nIn the human body,\nNurturing the embryo to return to its original form—\nThis is completion and ripening.\n\nWhen things are ripe,\nThey return to their origin—\nLike winter’s grasses and trees bearing fruit,\nLeaves falling back to roots,\nReturning to the three years of suckling,\nNine years of wall-gazing,\nRefining the pure yang body,\nAchieving the golden-colored *dharma-body*—\nOne must release all entanglements,\nHold no thoughts,\nEmpty and hollow,\nSilently awaiting the yang’s birth.\n\nThough life arises,\nIt was originally self-existent—\nYet one must not cling to it as one’s own.\n\nEven with techniques of ascent and descent,\nAdvancement and retreat—\nThese are still contrivances,\nYet all must follow the natural movement of *qi*,\nWithout the slightest force or coercion—\nIs this not effortless yet not relying on contrivance?\n\nAs *virtue/power* advances daily,\nThe Dao grows daily,\nAnd the *yin* and *yang* forces refine,\nBathing and sealing firmly—\nAll are governed by the original spirit within.\n\nThis is having a master yet no master,\nRuling yet no ruler—\nHow profound and distant is this Dao!\nThus it is called *\"Playful Virtue.\"*\n\n**Chapter 52: The Origin of the World**\nThe world has a beginning,\nWhich becomes the mother of the world.\nHaving obtained its mother,\nOne knows its children;\nHaving known its children,\nOne returns to guard its mother—\nAnd thus avoids peril throughout life.\n\nSeal the *yui* (mouth),\nClose the gate,\nAnd labor no more for life.\nOpen and return to clarity—\nNo harm will come to the body—\nThis is called *\"Following the Constant.\"*\n\nThe Golden Elixir—what is it?\nNothing but the primordial true *qi* of the first Heaven.\nAncients likened it to true lead,\nTo golden flowers,\nTo white snow,\nTo the initial bowstring *qi* of the White Tiger—\nAll metaphors,\nYet ultimately referring to the union of Heaven and Earth,\nWhere Heaven loses a *yang* and falls into the Earth’s domain,\nAnd Earth, obtaining this Heavenly *yang*’s golden nature,\nBecomes solid and forms the *kan* (water).\nThus it is called \"golden\"—\nFor it descends from the Heavenly Trigram,\nAnd in the body is called *yang* essence.\n\nThough this essence dwells in the water palace,\nIt is the primordial *qi* of the first Heaven,\nCapable of becoming the mother of elixir cultivation.\nThe adept, refining medicine at the furnace,\nMust force the *yang* lead from the water palace as the elixir’s mother.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"All the body’s blood is pure yin,\nThe body’s yang essence few recognize.\"*\nThis yang essence—\nNeither inside nor outside,\nNot entering the six sense-gates,\nNot among the six dusts—\nHidden in the form-mountain,\nSeen yet unseen,\nHeard yet unheard,\nYet ever generating and unceasing—\nIt is the true seed and great foundation of the body.\n\nIf the yin essence does not obtain this primordial yang lead as its mother,\nThe yin essence will scatter easily,\nWith no way to congeal into the elixir.\n\n「Thus, the *qi* of this body—\nShared by all sentient beings of the same kind—\nIs refined in the alchemical furnace;\n\nThen the primordial *yang* *qi* of the first Heaven,\nAnd the profoundest *yin* essence,\nEmerge from the state of *void* extremity and tranquil stillness,\nFrom the hazy and boundless depths—\nThis is the **upper elixir mother**, also the **mother *qi****.\n\nWith *yang* fire, one compels it to ascend and surge,\nUntil it reaches the *nīhuán* (泥丸, \"mud pellet\"),\nWhere it mingles with the long-accumulated *yin* karma,\nDescending to the upper palate,\nTransforming into sweet dew—\nThis is the **yin essence**, also called the **child *qi****.\n\nFrom this point, it descends to the **heavy palace** (重楼),\nPouring into the **divine chamber** (神房),\nTo be ingested and swallowed,\nWarming the gentle divine fire,\nNurturing this primordial *yang* *qi* and profoundest *yin* essence—\nThis is what the **Supreme Sage** (太上) meant by:\n*\"Having obtained its mother, one knows its child;\nHaving known its child, one returns to guard its mother.\"*\n\nAt first, the mother *qi* descends to embrace the child,\nThen the child *qi* clings to the mother in abiding,\nAnd finally, child and mother unite in harmony,\nNourishing each other—\nAs *yin* and *yang* interact yet return to their original source,\nEven death cannot harm one.\n\nFrom this, one must firmly uphold the **Rule of the Middle** (规中),\nWhere a single spirit is contained within—\nEndeavor to keep inner thoughts from straying outward,\nAnd external thoughts from entering in,\nSilencing speech, sealing the six sense-gates,\nContinuously and subtly,\nWithout wavering or ceasing,\nNeither aiding nor neglecting,\nWhether diligent or not—\nSo throughout life, one attains the **Golden Immortal** (金仙) state.\n\nOtherwise, if one seeks external gain,\nOne has already lost the internal treasure.\n\nAs it is said:\n*\"The mouth opens, the divine *qi* scatters;\nThe mind is disordered, the fire’s power wanes.\"*\n\nThose who value the external over the internal—\nTheir vital essence is already spent,\nTheir life-root where is it?\n\nHence, they are doomed throughout life.\n\nIf one can seal the **mouth of the *yīn* vessel** (塞兑) and close the gates,\nPreserving essence and gathering *qi*,\nThe mother *qi* and child *qi* merge to form the elixir.\n\nThe ancients said:\nThe **Emperor of Primordial Beginning** (元始天王),\nHangs a single **millet pearl** (黍珠) in the void,\nSeemingly present yet not,\nSeemingly empty yet not empty—\nOnly those who silently perceive with a focused mind\nCan truly see it.\n\nNothing is smaller than this elixir,\nAnd those who can see it are the truly wise.\n\nWhen the *yang* *qi* emerges,\nThe entire body softens like silk—\nThis is the **ultimate gentleness**.\n\nIf one can guard this ultimate gentle *qi*,\nWithout mixing a single thought,\nWithout adding a single perception,\nOver time, it will naturally manifest as **vast and surging *qi***,\nPiercing the heavens and filling the sun.\n\nThus, *\"Guarding gentleness is called strength.\"*\n\nYet at the outset of practice,\nThe divine light descends to illuminate the **sea of *qi*** (气海),\nThen the fire steams and the water boils,\nThe **golden essence** (金精) radiates,\nLike tides, like fire,\nLike mist, like smoke—\nI must then **withdraw sight and return hearing** (收视返听),\nSafeguarding its brilliance,\nGuiding it back to the **earthly crucible** (土釜),\nRestoring it to my primordial *yang* *qi*—\nSmall gains extend life and ward off illness,\nGreat gains achieve immortality and sainthood—\nWhat harm can come to the body then?\n\nOtherwise, old age, sickness, and death,\nWill arrive in the blink of an eye—\nHow can one not grieve?\n\nAll this is self-made,\nNot predestined by Heaven.\n\nIf one does not love the Dao,\nDoes one not love one’s body?\n\nDo not bring ruin upon yourself,\nFor regret will come too late.\n\nThis is the **true and constant Dao** (真常之道),\nOnly the **perfected** (至人) can follow its constancy,\nWithout defying its Way.\n\nThus, day by day, month by month,\nOne reaches the **divine and boundless mystery** (神妙无方),\nWhere transformations are unfathomable.\n\nThe saying goes:\n*\"Steadfastness is the foundation for becoming a Sage;\nA vacant heart is the vessel for bearing the Dao.\"*\nCan one afford to neglect it?\n\nThese words speak of the **true *yang* primordial *qi***,\nWhich originates from the moment one receives *qi* and takes form—\nFor life arises from *qi*,\nAnd *qi* is not trifling.\n\nConsider before birth—\nDid one not possess this *qi*?\nAfter death—\nThis *qi* is not necessarily extinguished.\n\nThe **primordial *yang* *qi*** (先天一气),\nSuspended in the **Great Void** (太空),\nExists within things when there are things,\nReturns to the Great Void when there are none.\n\nAll phenomena within Heaven and Earth,\nFrom the most mundane to the grandest,\nHave birth and death to speak of—\nBut this *qi* is neither born nor extinguished,\nNeither defiled nor pure,\nNeither increased nor diminished,\nEmpty yet not empty,\nNot empty yet empty—\nThe most divine and most wondrous of all,\nHence the **initial *qi* of all ten thousand things** (天下万物生生不息之始气).\n\nIf a Daoist practitioner knows how to obtain this **initial *qi***,\nThen the **Way of Longevity** (长生之道) can be attained,\nAnd the **state of Immortal Sagehood** (神仙之位) can be verified.\n\nFor the Immortal Sage is not inherently wondrous—\nIt is merely the *yang* *qi* lingering upon the *yin* essence,\nRefined over time until the *yin* essence transforms into *yang* *qi*,\nAnd the *yang* *qi* returns to the *yang* spirit—\nAs it is said:\n*\"This body is not that of a common mortal,\nBut the Immortal Sage from the Great Luo Heaven.\"*\n\nIf one were to cultivate only one aspect,\nHow could one attain **perfection of both form and spirit** (形神俱妙),\nIn harmony with the Dao,\nReaching the **ultimate extremes of odd and even** (极奇极变),\nThe **Sage’s self-illuminating essence** (至圣自灵)?\n\nThus, when the fire reaches its proper stage,\nThe golden elixir manifests—\nNaturally, the mouth forgets speech,\nThe tongue forgets taste,\nThe nose forgets scent,\nThe eyes see nothing,\nThe ears hear nothing—\nAs it is said:\n*\"The elixir field holds treasure,\nNaturally, one forgets all external appearances.\"*\n\nThis is the principle:\nThe one who **lightens the external** (轻外) **heavens the internal** (重内),\nThe one who guards the internal **forgets the external** (忘外)—\nAn unchanging law.\n\nYet before attaining the elixir,\nOne must still seal the *yīn* vessel and close the gates,\nTo accumulate essence and gather *qi*—\nAnd know that seeing the **small elixir** (小丹) is wisdom,\nWhile guarding the **Great Harmony** (太和) brings natural strength.\n\nEntering *qi* with the spirit,\nStoring spirit within *qi*—\nSuddenly, a single **millet pearl** appears,\nIts light permeating the **Dharma Realm** (法界)—\nThis is the moment when the **golden elixir radiates** (金丹焕发),\nAnd the **Great Dao is about to manifest** (大道将发).\n\nAt first, one uses the spirit to descend and await the *qi*,\nThen the *qi* arises,\nAnd one again uses the spirit to compel it upward,\nDriving it back to its source—\nThus attaining the **elixir of longevity** (长生之丹),\nAnd what harm can come to the body then?\n\nThis is achieved through constant practice and unceasing effort.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: Walking the Great Dao**\n*\"Let me, with some awareness, walk the Great Dao,\nOnly fearing the Way’s own rules.\"*\n\nThe Great Dao is so smooth,\nYet people prefer shortcuts.\nMorning is so clear,\nYet fields grow overgrown,\nGranaries remain empty.\n\nWearing embroidered silks, girding sharp blades,\nSated with food and drink, yet wealth overflows—\nThis is called the **thief’s staff** (盗竿).\nHow can this be the Dao?\n\nThe **gentleman’s Way** begins with husband and wife;\nThe **Sage’s Way** does not stray beyond yin and yang.\nIf one follows Heaven’s movement and acts in accordance with nature,\nCultivating virtue for oneself is **ren** (仁),\nAnd transforming the world is **wisdom** (智).\nUniting inner and outer in perfect harmony,\nThus all measures find their proper place and all things flourish.\n\nWhat need is there for contrived schemes?\nWhat is there to fear?\n\nYet the Dao is fundamentally plain and ordinary,\nLacking any hidden strangeness.\nIn the latter ages, men weary of moderation and delight in the bizarre,\nThus straying into crooked paths and byways, unaware.\n\nTake the court above:\nIts laws and institutions are truly the means to civilize the people,\nYet the ignorant fail to recognize them,\nAnd all are discarded as obsolete.\nThey favor the newly promoted while spurning old ministers,\nDelight in constant change and upend governance.\nAncestral precedents are all swept away—\nLike a man’s vital *qi* being drained.\n\nThe court lacks good governance, the countryside lacks models.\nThus, farmers abandon their fields to seek ease,\nLand lies fallow, weeds and grasses grow unchecked—\nThe source of wealth is exhausted.\nExpenditures grow ever greater,\nGranaries are depleted, grain stores empty—\nThe reserves of wealth are spent.\n\nThey do not seek inner substance but only boast outward splendor.\nThus, garments must gleam with brilliance,\nBlades must gleam with sharpness,\nFeasts must overflow with delicacies,\nWealth must abound—\nYet they do not consider the depletion of the roots,\nOnly the rivalry of the branches.\nTo desire the inexhaustible and the unending,\nTo act without hindrance in all things—\nIs this not delusion?\n\nAll this arises from rejecting the natural Way of Heaven,\nFrom neglecting the ordinary, daily Dao.\nIt is like a thief stealing goods—\nHiding his head while exposing his tail,\nStanding like a staff—\nVisible only in shadow, not in form—\nA metaphor for those who practice the Dao with falsehood for truth.\n\nWhat of the Great Dao?\nThis is the sudden, clear knowing—\nNot contrived, not forced.\n\nThe vast and boundless *qi*, the primordial unity of Heaven and Earth at its first opening—this is the **original *Zǔqì* of Pre-Heaven**. Just as Mencius, upon suddenly seeing a child fall into a well, had a surge of alarm, compassion, and distress—this is the **sudden knowing of true *liángzhī*** in my Dao.\n\nThe stirring of such true *liángzhī* is not difficult to recognize, yet to act upon it and sustain it forever is no simple matter. When it moves, the world before one’s eyes is clear—yet in the blink of an eye, one is drawn into transformation, desire arises, emotions stir, and unaware, it slips into the private knowledge of **Post-Heaven**. This is why it must be tempered and applied with caution—**its power is truly to be feared**.\n\nOnly when the **eye holds the wisdom-pearl** and the **chest wields the insight-sword** can one pierce through the demons of illusion and sever the threads of desire. From **plucking herbs** to **returning to the elixir**, all are the unfolding of true *liángzhī* into true *liángnéng*—a path smooth and unadorned, with no trace of the strange. This is why the **Great Dao is so effortlessly vast**.\n\nAlas, though the **Great Dao is plain and ordinary**, those who seek swift progress and immediate results often stray from the **Kāngzhuāng Path**, venturing into narrow, twisted side trails. They mistake their own deviation for attainment, yet never awaken in their lifetime—**how lamentable!**\n\nThe body is like the morning sun: it longs for adornment yet fears annihilation. Only by **quelling evil and preserving sincerity** can one first purify desire and fully manifest Heaven’s principle. How could the **spiritual radiance** ever be allowed to fade? How could the **vital essence** ever be depleted? Without embroidered beauty, yet naturally resplendent; without oil and grain, yet fully sated—**why cling to external ornamentation or indulge in feasts?**\n\nThe **insight-sword** is keen—**no need for borrowed blades**. When the **Three Treasures** are perfected, **internal wealth** is inexhaustible—**no need for external riches**. Those who grasp this truly **steal the Heavenly *Língyáng* *qi*** to forge the elixir.\n\nYet today’s practitioners, abandoning **the Doctrine of the Mean**, rush toward **crooked paths**. Their bodies are thick with dust and filth—**how can they ever be cleansed?** Moreover, they recklessly provoke misfortune, losing their **Original *Yuányáng*** *qi*. Thus, they flit about in vain, never attaining the **empty void’s divine spirit**. When desolation reaches its peak, **the orifices are not entirely sealed**—**how can their vitality ever be restored?** When strength is exhausted and spirit drained, **there is no sign of repletion**. **Poverty is indeed to be lamented**—**how could their essence ever be whole?**\n\nThey boast of **external brilliance**, yet their adornments are mere pretense; they wield **blades of sharpness**, yet prize only the **waistband’s display**. **This is truly the end!**\n\nWhy do they not instead **learn how practitioners cleverly use the mechanisms** to **steal back the Original *qi***? The *I Ching* says: *“He who composes the *Yì* knows well how to steal.”*—just this is meant.\n\nTo abandon this and seek elsewhere is already **fragmented and extreme**—**how dare one claim it as the Great Dao?** The commentary below states that the phrase *“suddenly knowing”* is but a fleeting glimpse of clarity—**how could it ever be called true knowing?** Yet when tested in actual practice, one often falters in execution—hence the warning.\n\nThis reveals the **difficulty of the Great Dao**. The next section speaks of scholars who do not delve into the **root source** but only pride themselves on **external refinement**; who do not seek **true attainment** but only chase **empty fame**—just as one stands a staff and sees only its shadow, mistaking semblance for reality. **This is truly the thief of the staff.**\n\nThe lesson holds true. From ancient times, all who had the Dao—**their skin smooth and luminous, their hair crisp and bright**—these effects were shared by common folk, yet still not proof enough. **What of refining essence and *qi*?** When the **Yang Light** touches, **Yīnmái** cannot endure—just as frost and snow melt in the sun. Thus, even **aged illnesses** dissolve into **ulcers and pus**, expelled through the **large and small intestines**, not only for beginners but even at the stage of **Great Elixir Return**—**there are always transformations**.\n\nThe **Three Corpses and Six Bandits**, bleeding and oozing pus, their stench unbearable—**only those whose hearts are settled and whose faith in the principles is unshaken, who have truly penetrated the scriptures, can avoid this**.\n\nOne must know that **restraining desire and preserving sincerity**, **removing turbidity and retaining purity**—each layer involves the **dissipation of Yin *qi*** and the **subtle growth of Yang**. Practitioners of the Dao cannot ignore these **external manifestations**.\n\nDo not fixate on **bodily glory** or **swift movement**—**these cannot be relied upon as proof**. Even **soaring through clouds, vanishing into ghosts**, **a thousand transformations in a moment, ten thousand miles in an instant**—**these cannot be trusted as the Dao**. For **strange and marvelous phenomena**, **heterodox and perverse teachings** will inevitably **lead one astray**, producing **monstrous deviations**. **Pity that a lifetime’s vitality is wasted on crooked paths!** To **aspire to transcendence** yet fall into **the Three Paths and Six Realms**—**is this not deeply regrettable?**\n\nThe essence of this chapter by the **Supreme Sage** teaches that **only by recognizing true *liángzhī* can one avoid error**. Yet today’s Dao practitioners seek only **smooth skin and strong bodies**—**they do not realize that external labor exhausts the mind, while the Original Fields lie fallow and the Treasure Granaries empty**. Many have already **damaged their Pre-Heaven essence**.\n\nThough **Post-Heaven** may be intact, **what good is it?** Truly, when the **Three Treasures** gather, **external form naturally radiates**. Yet those who **dash outward** while **boasting of food and clothing**—**why not instead seek within, enriching the inner wealth first?** When **internal riches are full**, **external wealth comes naturally**. **Is this not unlike thieves**—**who steal not the Heavenly *Língyáng* *qi* but only the name of the Sage’s refinement?**\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: Cultivating the Body**\n*\"The well-built stands firm, the well-embraced does not slip—*\n*their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\"*\n\n**Cultivating the body**, its **virtue is complete**;\n**Cultivating the family**, its **virtue overflows**;\n**Cultivating the village**, its **virtue grows long**;\n**Cultivating the state**, its **virtue becomes abundant**.\n\n「**Cultivating the Way in the world**, its **virtue becomes universal**. Hence, one **observes the body through the body**, the **family through the family**, the **village through the village**, the **state through the state**, and the **world through the world**. **How do I know the world is thus?** By this.\n\nThe **Heaven and Earth** in giving birth to humans, **bestow *qi* to establish life** and **impart *lǐ* (principle/pattern) to perfect nature**. *Qi* and *lǐ* are originally unified—**nature and life** are inseparable. **All are but the pure, boundless *qi*, revolving through Heaven and Earth**, waxing and waning, ebbing and flowing, **wholly in accord with the natural**, **creative transformations** passing through **countless generations**. Though human kinds may differ and **the Creator’s works** vary in measure, **this *qi* is shared**, **this *lǐ* is shared**, **never changing in its essence**.\n\nThe **Sage dwells at the center**, **establishing the poles**, **erect and unyielding**, **independent yet not leaning**, **moderate yet never in peril**. Though **prosperity and adversity, life and death, joy and sorrow** all differ, **this *lǐ* and this *qi* flow within a single body**, **filling the two great realms (Heaven and Earth)**, **never diminished in the slightest**. **Is this not the meaning of “the well-built stands firm”?**\n\nOtherwise, **what has form and substance**—even so **the towering Tai Mountain**, **lofty and thick**—still **faces the risk of collapse**. For **what is formed**, though firm and enduring, **finds it hard to last**. Yet **the formless *lǐ* and *qi*, unchanging with things, unmoved by numbers**, **ever renewed through the ages**. This **Dao** is **rooted in oneself**, **transforming harmoniously to all**—**naturally deep in benevolence and thick in grace**, **penetrating to the marrow and flesh**, **so the people love and cherish it, their devotion unceasing**, **none for a breath’s time detached or disconnected**.\n\nThough **daily bound like glue or invested like bamboo**, one may say **“how firm!”**; though **mixed like water and milk**, one may say **“how harmonious!”**—yet **gathering and scattering are without constancy**, **changes and shifts are swift**, **and in the blink of an eye, discord appears**. But **benevolent heart and benevolent reputation**, **those touched by its grace love it and forget not**, **those who hear its wind cherish it and abandon not**—**how unlike the child’s dependence on father and elder brother**, **or the arm’s response to the heart’s will**, **with no separation or disconnection?** **Is this not the meaning of “the well-embraced does not slip”?**\n\nFrom this, **the virtuous person** cherishes **his own virtue** and **loves his own kin**; **the petty man** enjoys **his own pleasures** and **seeks his own gain**. **All is but governance by the unadorned robe**, **sharing in the rest of the effortless**. Though the **Sage may not always remain**, **his virtue and grace deeply ingrained in the hearts of men** **endure forever, never fading**.\n\nThe *Shijing* says:\n*“Enduring generations of descendants,\nDo not neglect their offerings.”*\n**Is this not what is meant?**\n\nIn ancient times, Confucius praised **Shun’s great filial piety**, saying:\n*“In the ancestral temples, he is honored;\nHis descendants safeguard his legacy.”*\n**This shows virtue without bounds**—**descendants’ sacrifices** **everlasting, like the ceaseless steam of offerings and the ever-renewed ancestral dishes**. The saying goes:\n*“He who has virtue for ten generations\nShall have descendants who preserve it for ten generations.\nHe who has virtue for a hundred generations\nShall have descendants who preserve it for a hundred generations.”*\n**As for great virtue enduring eternally**, even **a billion or ten billion years**, **his descendants shall follow in succession**, **ever more flourishing and lasting**, **for such is the unchanging principle**.\n\nThis is all **by the Dao of effortless naturalness**—**internally cultivated in oneself yet never lost**, **externally extended to others yet never forgotten**—**thus Heaven’s body is nourished to its fullest**, **and the world enjoys its boundless blessings**. **When a man cultivates this Dao in his own person**, **both form and spirit are perfected**, **and he is in truth united with the Dao**. **The Dao is the body, the body is the Dao**—**this Dao and this body**, **two without divergence**—**how could virtue be more true?**\n\nMoreover, **when the Dao is cultivated in the village**, **the village unites as one**; **when the Dao is cultivated in the state**, **the state regards itself as one**. **How vast and abundant is its virtue?** If **one can remain tranquil and unforced**, **serene and desireless**, **naturally the winds of the four quarters move**, **the world turns to benevolence**, **the people cherish his virtue**, **without end**—**how could virtue be more universal?** This is **not by force or by bribery**, but **the innate goodness of Heaven**, **cultivated in the true, unrestrained heart**—**like the wanderer’s longing for home** or **the aged’s joy in reunion**, **a happiness that comes when none expects it**.\n\n**Man and self differ in body yet share the same heart**,\n**share the same life and thus respond in kind**—\n**so manifesting virtue renews the people**,\n**calming them comes from cultivating oneself**,\n**none differing in this**.\n\n**What is more**, the **village is the accumulation of the family**, the **state is the expansion of the village**—**the world’s vastness**, **the multitude of its people**, **are but the family, the village, the state gradually extended and broadened**, **gradually gathered and multiplied**. **Know that the Dao of one is the Dao of family, state, and Heaven as one**; **cultivating oneself is cultivating family, state, and world**. **Reflecting inward, one must extend outward**—**there is the silent transformation, the subtle change**, **the ease of custom and the shift of winds**, **and thus all rejoice in their shared happiness**.\n\nThus it is said:\n*“First virtue and transformation, then human hearts arise;\nFirst human hearts, then customs and mores follow.”*\n**Its Dao lies in the body**,\n**its virtue extends to the family**,\n**and its transformation spreads like grass bowing to the wind**,\n**reaching no distance it does not embrace**,\n**extending through village and state unto the world**.\n\n**Ah! How do I know the world is thus?** By this.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*“Great is the **primordial element of *Qián*** (Heaven)!\n**Strong and unyielding, moderate and correct**—\n**pure and refined, its essence is perfect!”**\nThis is **the Dao of the preheaven *Qián* (Heavenly Stem), the ultimate strength and vigor**, **standing firm between Heaven and Earth**, **flowing through all things**, **embracing all without remainder**, **its sincerity unceasing**. **Its force is ever-extending yet never bending**, **straight yet never obstructed**, **supporting Heaven and bearing Earth**, **reaching the Han and piercing the sky**—**never has the state been even slightly shaken**.\n\nYet **it is the boundless extreme of the extreme**,\n**the spirit without spirit**,\n**and thus stands unshaken, so firm.»\n\nMan can establish his **body upon the boundless** (*wújí*) and **center his primordial spirit** in its function—thus the ancients spoke of **gathering the great elixir from the unmoving**, **conducting the fire-alchemy within the realm of non-action**. **Rooted in the center, erecting the pole**, the **vast and boundless *qi*** flows, **with *qi* dependent upon spirit**, **spirit and *qi* mutually resonating**, **knotted as one cluster**—thus returning to the root and restoring the command, **the Dao abides**.\n\nNow, **the birth of man**—**spirit and *qi* unite**; **his death**—**spirit and *qi* separate**. If man can **harmonize nature and life**, **fuse spirit and *qi***, then he **embraces the primordial and preserves the One**. **My fate is mine alone, not Heaven’s**—what escape could there be?\n\nThus, **spirit depends upon spirit**, **qi upon qi**, **one thread flowing through generations**, **one true essence permeating all**—**capable of myriad transformations**, **vanishing as ghost and emerging as spirit**, **manifesting countless forms**, **enjoying countless eons**. How could it be said that **a child begets a grandson, who begets a child again**, **generation upon generation**, **roots deep and leaves flourishing**, **source distant yet flow unending**, **illuminating the ancestral rites across ten thousand ages without cessation**?\n\nYet it is no more than **using primordial *qi* as medicine** and **primordial spirit as the alchemical fire**. **Primordial *qi* is no-*qi*** (*wúqì*), **primordial spirit is no-spirit** (*bùshén*). **Refining *qi* with spirit yields the Dao**, just as **fusing fire with medicine yields the elixir**. **Common elixirs may succeed or fail**, but **true elixir knows no end nor beginning**—thus it is said: *“The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir endures ten thousand years without erosion.”*\n\nIt is nothing but **cultivating one’s own virtue** and **refining one’s own body**—**not derived from later influences**, **not borrowed from without**—**thus its virtue is true**.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth give birth to man, **pure or impure, wise or foolish**, yet **when the august and sacred descend**, from the family to the realm, **each possesses an inherent constancy**. Thus, **a single heart can permeate ten thousand households**, **a single virtue can inspire ten thousand people**.\n\n**Cultivating the self to harmonize the family**—**virtue overflows**; **cultivating the self to transform the village**—**virtue endures**. As for **governing the state and pacifying the world**, it is nothing but **the sage’s robe swaying while the world transforms**—**there is no external cultivation of the self that can universally attain such influence**. This is the **constant Dao of the age**.\n\nConversely, **if one cultivates the self**, how could it differ?\n\nDiscussing the state and the world, it is **a matter of progressing from near to far**, **layer by layer**—**not a step-by-step retreat**. From the initial practice: **refining essence**, yet **qi and spirit are present**. The second step: **refining qi**, yet **spirit and essence remain**. The third step: **refining spirit**, yet **essence and qi are still within**. **Returning to the void and merging with the Dao**, **the Dao merging with nature**—**from beginning to end, it never departs**; **to depart is to lose the Dao**.\n\nThe **body is like essence**, but **essence is not the essence of mutual resonance**—it is the **initial essence received from the Great Void’s Five Phases**, the **inherited primordial essence that forms the body**. **Cultivating the body is refining essence into qi**. The practitioner, at first, **holds this essence to live and grow**. **Refining essence to cultivate the body is no different from cultivating the body itself**—how true is this!\n\nSpeaking of **qi**, essence is **closer to the body**, while **qi is slightly more distant**. *“Cultivating the family, its virtue overflows”*—**gathering external true yang-qi** to **refine internal true yin-essence** is like **using the body to harmonize the family**; **what abundance does one gain from oneself?**\n\nThe village, when viewed from the body, is **farther still**, yet **closer than the family**. It is like **spirit**, yet **spirit is fire**. **Heat belongs to qi**, **light belongs to spirit**—**two yet one**. **Cultivating the village is refining spirit back to the void**. Thus it is said: *“Its virtue endures”*, for **long life is boundless and eternal**.\n\nAs for the **state**, compared to the village it is **nearer**, yet **farther than the body**, its breadth **not visible in a single glance**. The **state is like the void**—**cultivating the state is refining the void to merge with the Dao**. **Refining until the void**, **becoming one with the clear and empty**, **illuminating the great thousandfold world**—what of the world itself? Thus it is said: *“Its virtue is universal.”*\n\nWhether observing **the body from the body**, **the family from the family**, **the village from the village**, **the state from the state**, or **the world from the world**—it is nothing but **using one’s own self and family as the model for the world’s self and family**, **taking the highest sage as analogy**—**its intent is intimate**, **its meaning profound**. The **Great Dao has no other path**: **refining essence to its utmost**, until it reaches **the void of natural spontaneity**. **Exhausted!**\n\nThe **learner of the Great Dao** has no other way: **only diminishing again and again**, until it reaches **the spontaneity of non-action**. **Non-action yet nothing remains undone**—**exhausted!**\n\nYet **internal elixirs and external elixirs**, **internal alchemy and external alchemy**, **drawing from the *Kàn* to fill the *Lí***, **extracting lead to add mercury**—**all these metaphors and names** ultimately refer to **the essence, *qi*, and spirit received from Heaven and Earth within the body**—**inherently possessed since birth**, yet **entrapped within the fleshly shell**, thus called *“yin-essence, yin-qi, yin-spirit”*; **since it comes with life itself**, it is called *“internal medicine.”*\n\nWhen the practitioner begins his work, he **must first close the senses and seal the orifices**, **concentrating within**, **regulating his breath**, **merging the Three Primordials into one cauldron**—**one cauldron refining the Three Primordials**—**named “refining essence”**, yet in truth **spirit and *qi* all return to one orifice**. Only when **spirit is harmonized and *qi* flows freely**, **united as one**, does the **vital mechanism activate**, **steaming and rising**—this is called **qi-transformation**, or **gold born from water’s depths**, or **the union of parents yielding the medicine**.\n\nThis is the **human way of procreation**; if one does not know the **method of inverse cultivation**, the moment **it transforms into postnatal, tangible essence**, it **leaks through the kidney passage**. Thus: *“Conserve *qi* and retain essence—this is the decisive path to longevity.”*\n\n**If man seeks longevity**, **the transformation of essence into *qi***—**this is the wondrous elixir of life**.\n\nWhen there are signs of conflict, one must urgently **internalize the Celestial Ganges** and **push outward the Dipper’s handle**, advance and retreat the **River Chariot**, and **reclaim the Central Palace** to **reforge anew**.\n\nThis is the **refinement of the inner elixir**, where **essence, *qi*, and spirit** merge as one—how much more than mere **qi-transformation**!\n\nOne **yin**, one **yang**—one **Kan**, one **Li**—first, with the body’s inherent capacities, **converging in the Yellow Chamber**, nurturing for a moment, and **vital *qi* arises**. This is **spirit entering *qi***, refining the **heavenly earthly-external celestial yang-*qi** from within the body’s essence—**this is essence-refinement into *qi***.\n\nNext, **harvesting this *qi* to ascend**, **guiding it to descend**, returning it to the **earthly cauldron** for repeated brewing and refining—**this is lead tempering mercury**, **subduing yang-*qi* beneath yin-essence**.\n\nFor **essence** is originally what the body inherently possesses, hence called **\"separated yin-essence of the self.\"** **Qi** arises from essence’s transformation, hence called **\"Kan-Wu yang-*qi**.\" It is not that **essence belongs to the heart** or **qi originates within the kidneys**.\n\nFrom **Yongquan to Qihai**, all belong to **yang**—**yang is Kan**; from **Nihuan to Xuanguan**, all belong to **yin**—**yin is Li**. Thus, **water-fire *qi*** are **Kan and Li**, not **heart and kidneys** being **Kan and Li**—this is now clear.\n\nAgain, **Kan’s *qi* is called earthly soul**—in **external elixir**, it is the **White Tiger**; in **internal elixir**, it is the **golden elixir**. This **elixir** arises from **extracting lead and adding mercury**, merging into one—all belonging to the **water palace’s mysterious pearl**.\n\nThe **internal-external distinction** is layer upon layer of **peeling**, not truly separate.\n\n**Li Palace’s essence is called heavenly spirit**—in **external elixir**, it is the **Green Dragon**; in **internal elixir**, it is **one’s true essence**. **Gold born from water** is **essence’s *qi*-transformation**—in **external elixir**, it is the **White Tiger’s initial crescent *qi***; in **internal elixir**, it is the **silver within lead**.\n\nAgain, it is called the **golden elixir**, the **great elixir of longevity**. Only this **Primordial *qi* of Heaven** sinks into the human body—if not **subdued by spiritual fire**, it will **sink and not rise**.\n\nEven if it stirs to move, it will **tilt and fail**—like oil in a lamp: **without oil, the flame extinguishes**; **without *qi*, life perishes**. Life’s continuity lies here, hence it is the **great elixir of longevity**.\n\nSince it **originates from Heaven but falls into Kan**, now **returning from Kan to Heaven**—this is the origin of the **golden elixir’s doctrine**.\n\nIf one seeks **longevity**, apart from this **water-bound lead**, there is **no other substance**.\n\nThough this **golden elixir** is said to belong to all, **without spiritual fire’s brewing**, it cannot arise.\n\nOnce the **true gold is born**, then **seize the White Tiger and subdue the Dragon**, causing the **Green Dragon to submit to the Tiger**. The **Dragon and Tiger *qi*** reunite in the **Yellow Chamber**, their **mutual devouring and consuming** forming the **golden elixir**.\n\nReturning to the **earthly cauldron**, merging with **true essence**, then **nurturing with spiritual fire** to form the **sacred embryo**. Once the embryo forms, **internally using natural true fire**, **endlessly within the spirit chamber**, while **externally adding mundane fire**, circulating through the body—**daily, one’s mercury encases and secures true essence**. Over time, it **sheds its shell and emerges**.\n\nAscending to **Nihuan**, refining the **void**, striving to return to **its original, natural state**. It is not that **essence, *qi*, and spirit** are **three separate treasures**, nor that **internal and external elixirs** are distinct. Unless one **sits until the cushion is worn through**, **grinds the knees raw**, and **endures self-cultivation in suffering**, how can one **penetrate its profound truth**?\n\nI now merely outline the **general principles**, merely pointing **later learners** toward the **main path**.\n\nThe **Dao is inherently ordinary**—not extraordinary. The more refined, the more ordinary it becomes.\n\nAs for its **transformations**, which seem boundless—**to worldly eyes**, it appears **unfathomable and unattainable**. Yet, with **Laozi’s *Dao De Jing* in mind**, even the **Three Pure Ones** are merely **ordinary mortals** who achieved it.\n\nBut **mortals** take **life and death** as **joy and sorrow**, while **immortals** view them **as day and night**. **Life and death** are like **rising and resting**—**carried out naturally**, without unease.\n\nThose who say **longevity and immortality** are **the Daoist’s delight** are mistaken. **Mortals** take **longevity as honor**, but **immortals** find **fulfillment in natural necessity**. Even if it means **sacrificing life for virtue** or **abandoning life for righteousness**, they **welcome it naturally**.\n\nOtherwise, who does not fear **the agony of the executioner’s blade**? **Ancient worthies and sages** often saw **the cauldron as a joyous place** and **death as a peaceful path**—**seeing truth clearly**, **trusting fate’s decree**. Their **living and dying** are all **guided by this heart**.\n\nTo **live uneasily** is worse than **dying swiftly**—like **staying awake in pain**, better to **sleep long**. As long as **spirit endures and principle is whole**, what is there to honor in **life** or shame in **death**?\n\nOne must **yield to Nature’s course**, **never clinging to life in this world**. To **cherish life and fear death** is the way of **common, vulgar folk**, not the **sage’s timely response to Heaven**.\n\nOtherwise, why did **Confucius die at seventy**, and **Yan Hui at thirty**? They **followed Heaven’s movement**, **daring not to defy it**. Who among mortals could comprehend this?\n\nI humbly hope that scholars seek only the inner truth, not the outer trappings—viewing trials, hardships, life, and death with equal indifference.\n\nThis heart is how vast, how serene! A proverb says:\n*\"Recognize the Way and depart in peace,\nLet Heaven’s will unfold as it may.\"*\n\nThus, one attains ease in life and tranquility in death,\nForever a true transcendent—\nHow superior to those who cling to life and fear death,\nNow joyful within, now troubled in heart,\nTheir minds never finding rest!\n\nWhat of those with lofty Dao? Heaven may wish to retain them\nTo set an example and guide the common folk.\nI neither reject nor pursue this—\nI simply yield to it, with no attachment.\nHow could I let such matters disturb my heart?\n\nFor life and death are both the Dao.\nTo live fully in the Dao, to die fully in the Dao—\nWhat need then for likes or dislikes?\n\nAll who harbor preferences within\nDisturb their spirit and lose their nature,\nUnworthy of being called *xian* [transcendent].\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Fifth: The Depth of Virtue/Power**\nThe depth of virtue/power is like that of an infant:\nPoisonous creatures do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not seize,\nRaptors do not strike.\n\nThough bones are frail and sinews soft, their grasp is firm.\nUnknowing of male and female union, yet life stirs—\nThe essence is at its peak.\n\nCrying all day yet the throat does not grow hoarse—\nHarmony is at its peak.\n\nTo know harmony is to know constancy;\nTo know constancy is to know clarity.\nIncreasing life is auspicious.\nForcing *qi* by will is strength—\nBut strength leads to aging, which is against the Dao.\nAgainst the Dao is premature decay.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth in their primal state,\nAll things refined in purity.\nMale and female unite in essence,\nAll things born in generation.\"*\n\nAt the beginning of birth, distant not from Heaven,\nTheir *qi* is soft and tender—\nGuide it by its momentum, nurture it by its opportunity,\nAnd one may yet reach the realm of pure transformation,\nThe primal harmony of Heaven.\n\nMencius said:\n*\"The noble sage does not lose the heart of an infant.\"*\n\nWhen an infant first cries upon entering the world,\nThough it possesses its own universe and opens new creation,\nYet it is undifferentiated, a bundle of pure innocence.\nWithout knowledge, without thought—\nStillness and transformation are one,\nMovement and Heaven align.\n\nThe ancient transcendent sages contained boundless light and virtue,\nTheir depth without limit—\nCompared to the infant, they are nearly equal.\n\nIn their parents’ embrace, nurtured and cared for,\nUnable to walk, unable to act,\nYet poisonous creatures cannot sting them,\nAnd fierce beasts cannot seize them.\n\nThough fierce birds of prey hover—\nThey cannot strike, for movement knows no direction,\nAnd steps know no path.\nThus, no dread of venomous creatures,\nYet venomous creatures cannot sting them;\nNo dread of fierce beasts,\nYet fierce beasts cannot seize them.\n\nEven when perched in danger upon the couch,\nOr reclining in slumber on the bed,\nThey are not spied upon by birds of prey—\nYet birds of prey would come to strike them.\nBut when youth has ripened and movement is unrestrained,\nThough there be the joys of wandering,\nThey cannot match the tranquility of the chamber—\nFew escape the calamities of malevolent things.\n\nHow much more so for the infant at birth,\nUnknowing of the union of male and female,\nTheir essence pure and vital, life’s momentum ever flourishing.\n\nIf one can concentrate the *qi* and soften like a newborn,\nThen the essence may be refined.\nEven when wailing ceaselessly from dawn to dusk,\nTheir throat never grows hoarse—\nNot from deliberate calling,\nNor from forced utterance.\nAll is the spontaneous motion of Heaven’s mechanism,\nThe natural resonance of Heaven’s sounds,\nWithout contrivance, without artifice—\nThe utmost harmony.\n\nTo grasp the primal harmony within,\nIs to attain the eternal Dao,\nWithout the slightest human effort to force or bend it,\nBut to preserve its eternal nature,\nAnd rest in its inherent state.\n\nAs the *Shijing* says:\n*\"Both wise and enlightened,\nTo preserve oneself thus—*\nIs this not what is meant?\"\n\nIf not with harmonious and yielding *qi*\nCultivated within body and mind,\nHow could one be born and grow ever more vital,\nThe Heavenly Body flourishing without decay?\nNo blessing surpasses this among mortals.\n\nYet once strength and vigor take hold,\nThe Heavenly Heart is disrupted by the human heart,\nAnd the dissipation of spirit is great.\n\nNow, taking the primal harmony as the Dao,\nGreat stillness alone can bring great motion,\nAnd supreme softness alone can overcome supreme hardness.\n\nThus, let the heart govern the *qi*,\nAnd strive to make this *qi* return to the state of the infant—\nDo not let the *qi* disturb the heart,\nLest the heart stray from the primal harmony.\nOnly then may one achieve harmony without dissipation—\nHow mighty is this rectification!\nIt is not merely the infant who embodies this.\n\nObserve all things:\nIn their beginning, they are soft and fragile;\nIn their end, they are strong and robust.\nSoftness and fragility are the seeds of life,\nStrength and robustness are the omens of death.\nThus, when things grow strong, they grow old,\nNot as when they are young, they live.\nLife preserves its Dao,\nDeath abandons its Dao.\nHence it is said: *\"Things that age are against the Dao,\nAnd against the Dao, it is better to have never been.\"*\n\nLet those who cultivate the Dao\nEarly abandon the *qi* of aging,\nAnd seek the *qi* of the infant.\nIf one truly attains the state of the infant—\nFearless, without terror,\nWithout knowledge, without thought,\nA boundless undifferentiated whole,\nFlowing beyond all forms—\nThis is harmony.\n\nFor the Dao of Heaven nurtures all things through harmony.\nIf one knows this,\nThen vitality flows without ceasing—\nThus it is called *constant*.\nTo know the constant is to penetrate yin and yang,\nTo align with creation—\nThus it is called *enlightenment*.\nTo cultivate the self and establish one’s fate,\nTo seize the power of Heaven and Earth’s life and death—\nNo blessing surpasses this among mortals.\n\nRefining the spirit and returning to the void,\nAttaining the Dao of unending life—\nHow could this not be the ultimate strength?\nWhat is there that is not the Dao?\n\nThis is the method of cultivating the self,\nTaking the infant as its symbol.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The infant moves without knowing where,\nWalks without knowing where it goes,\nIts body like withered wood,\nIts heart like dead ashes—\nDisaster does not come,\nFortune does not arrive.\"*\n\nIf disaster and fortune are nonexistent,\nHow could there be human calamities or harm from things?\n\nThe lines on *\"poisonous creatures\"* express this very meaning.\n\nLater, when gathering herbs or refining elixirs,\nOne must take the pristine, tender water of the first hour—\nThis water is the source of all life.\nLike a wheel of red sun at midnight,\nClear and bright, illuminating the vast sea;\nOr like a crescent moon in autumn,\nEmerging in the *Geng* and *Zhen* directions—\nThis is when the adept’s mystical pass opens,\nVague and distant, yet this realm is attained.\n\nFor when the initial *qi* is cultivated in softness,\nIt is like all things bending their branches and sprouting leaves.\nNurture and nourish it thus,\nAnd it will grow daily and monthly,\nUntil returning to the root of life,\nAnd bearing the fruit of fulfillment.\n\nBut in the declining years of twilight,\nThings have aged and are withering,\nUnfit to be gathered as medicine.\nYet aging is not measured by years—\nIt refers to the *qi* of the herb growing old and unfit for elixir.\n\nIf measured by years,\nEven at eighty or ninety,\nOne may still cultivate the Dao of eternal youth.\nFor as long as breath remains,\nThis very *qi* of primal harmony suffuses the body,\nWithout the slightest deficiency.\n\nThe adept who has not pierced through the celestial realm within the waters of the self—\nwith inner and outer *qi* flowing as two distinct currents—\nwill often pass by the truth before their very eyes.\n\nThe student who seeks to cultivate the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir\nmust empty the heart to inquire of the Way,\naccumulate virtue to reverse the heavens,\nor the true teacher will never be drawn to manifest,\nand the *White Tiger Canon* will remain unfound.\nEven if youth enters the Dao,\nthey will surely grow old without attainment.\n\nMany have erred by following false teachers,\nwandering down false paths,\nand wasted their lifetimes’ essence in the realm of beasts.\nLet the student beware!\n\n**Chapter 56: The Most Noble for All Under Heaven**\n\nThe wise do not speak; those who speak do not understand.\nClose the mouth, shut the gate,\ndull the sharpness, resolve the tangled,\nharmonize the light, blend with the dust—\nthis is called *Mystic Unity*.\n\nThus, one cannot be too close nor too distant,\ntoo beneficial nor too harmful,\ntoo noble nor too lowly.\nTherefore, they are the most noble for all under heaven.\n\nGenerally, those without virtue,\nwhen they hear a good word or see a good deed,\nimmediately chatter grandly to stir others,\nthus pleasing the moment without ever\ntransforming their face or purifying their heart,\nor reflecting inwardly to verify the truth.\n\nConfucius said, *\"Hearsay and gossip are the abandonment of virtue,\"*\nand this is indeed not false.\n\nBut the true knower of the Great Dao,\nwhen they occasionally grasp something,\nis occupied morning and evening with solemn vigilance—\nhow could they have the leisure to speak for others’ ears?\nEven if they ponder the old to know the new,\nand suddenly grasp the meaning,\nthey possess it themselves and find it in themselves—\nlike one sated with food and drink,\ndrunk and full,\nknowing the taste for themselves alone,\nyet unable to convey it to others.\n\nThose who love to speak of such things\nmust surely lack something within themselves.\n\nMoreover, virtue is for oneself, cultivation is for oneself—\nonce truly known, it must be guarded all the more.\nFear that a single careless word\nmight cause even a breath to stray,\nand the Way lost from the heart.\nThis is why the wise do not speak.\n\nIf they speak, it is because they lack virtue within themselves,\ntruly knowing nothing of the Dao.\nIf they truly knew, why would they so lightly reveal it?\nThus, those who speak do not understand—\nthis is even more evident.\n\nBesides, the essence is what cannot be spoken of,\nand what can be spoken of is but dross.\nThe wise do not fail to speak because they cannot,\nbut because it is difficult to speak.\nThose who speak do not fail to know,\nbut only see the surface.\n\nAs the saying goes, *\"When you’ve grasped it, close your mouth.\"*\nIndeed, knowing the Dao is not easy—\nhow could one waste their *qi* with words,\nor taint their spirit with idle chatter,\nboasting of talents and abilities to stand out,\nonly to invite the disdain of the vulgar?\n\nThus, the high ones of the Way\nclose the mouth and shut the gate to nurture their *qi*;\ndull the sharpness and resolve the tangled to steady their spirit;\nharmonize their light and blend with the dust,\nbowing and rising with the times,\nfloating and sinking with the world,\nas if foolish, as if drunk,\nas if slow of speech, as if mad—\nwhen the multitude is confused, they too are confused,\nneither flaunting their oddities nor setting themselves apart,\ncontradicting neither themselves nor the world.\n\nShould even a trace of pretense or ambition arise,\nthey cannot help but speak grandly to satisfy a moment’s pleasure.\nSuch people seek either fame or gain—\nhave they not heard the *Taishang*’s words to Confucius?\n\n*\"Those who can be fed with wine and meat,\nI will whip and beat.\nThose who can be honored with rank and wealth,\nI will pierce and insult.\"*\n\nOnly by secluding oneself to cultivate in secret,\nembracing the primal and guarding the One,\nremaining silent and still,\n*qi* dim and mysterious,\ntranquil and without desire,\nacting without action, doing without doing—\nthen one cannot be too close nor too distant,\ntoo beneficial nor too harmful,\ntoo noble nor too lowly.\n\nThis is to seek within oneself, not without,\nnot seeking from others,\nfulfilling one’s nature and returning to one’s life—\nthus, they are the most noble for all under heaven.\n\nWithin the Three Realms, only the Dao is supreme.\nI cultivate my Dao, and thus my Dao is noble—\nnothing under heaven surpasses this.\n\nThe *Taishang* said: *\"Few know me, thus I am noble.\"*\nDo the students know this as well?\n\nThe person of the Way must not speak lightly,\nfor few in the world understand the Dao.\nIf one indulges in idle talk,\nnot only does it harm oneself internally,\nbut it also invites external scorn from others.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says: *\"If secrets are not kept, harm will follow.\"*\nThroughout history, many cultivators\nhave invited disaster by carelessly revealing secrets.\n\nThus, the virtuous are cautious and do not speak lightly.\nEven if one speaks to the worthy,\nthey proceed with utmost caution and deliberation,\ntesting again and again,\nbefore solemnly vowing to heaven and earth,\nascending the platform to teach—\nyet they dare not speak too high or too far,\nlest they prattle endlessly.\n\nThis shows the ancient practice of concealing brilliance and obscuring the light,\nand their reverence for the Dao and awe of heaven.\n\nThose who speak lightly know nothing within themselves.\nIf they truly knew, they would be too occupied with self-cultivation and verification\nto have leisure for idle talk.\n\nThose who speak without restraint\nare already bound to fall from nobility.\n\nWith my Dao noble and my Way exalted,\nI can extend from one age to ten thousand ages—\nwho under heaven can surpass this?\n\nLet the student cultivate what lies within,\nmoment by moment, inwardly observing,\nlest the wind of idle discourse arise.\n\n**Chapter 57: Governing the Realm with Rectitude**\n\nGovern the realm with rectitude,\nemploy the strange in warfare,\nand take the world without conflict.\nHow do I know this to be true?\n\nBecause: the more taboos there are under heaven,\nthe poorer the people become;\n\nWhen the people pursue profit and greed, the state grows corrupt;\nwhen the people indulge in cleverness, strange things proliferate;\nwhen laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits abound.\n\nThus the Sage said:\n*\"I do without action, yet the people transform themselves.\nI love stillness, yet the people align themselves.\nI take no action, yet the people grow wealthy.\nI desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nConfucius said: *\"My Dao is one, threading through all things.\"*\nThis is to say: the Dao is singular, yet all things under heaven—\nten thousand affairs, ten thousand beings—\nare but this Dao manifesting and flowing.\nAs the saying goes: *\"One root branches into myriad forms,\nyet myriad forms return to one root.\"*\n\nTo govern oneself and the world—\nthis is the great principle.\nThe Dao of governing the world\nlies in ensuring that scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants\neach find their proper place in life;\nthat filial piety and brotherly love, loyalty and trust\nfollow the innate goodness of humanity.\nThese are daily, ever-present matters—\nthe great principles of the world,\nthe eternal laws of ages past and to come,\nthe constant Dao, the true Way.\nWhat each person ought to fulfill\nis what each person inherently possesses as virtue.\n\nFor those who rule the people,\npracticing frugality in person,\nexhausting oneself in filial piety and benevolence,\nleading by example for all under heaven,\nand governing with solemn dignity—\none must guide them without ceasing,\ncalming with stillness, steadying with composure,\navoiding frivolous actions that would embolden disorder,\nand maintaining rectitude so that all things fall into order naturally,\nlike wind sweeping grass flat.\nThus, as Mencius said:\n*\"Rectify the ruler, and the state is settled.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"The world has endured for ages.\"*\nNow one age of order, then one of chaos—\na cycle that repeats without fail,\nfrom ancient times to this day.\n\nThough in times of order, ritual and music prevail,\nand in times of chaos, arms and warfare dominate,\nwhen two armies face each other in battle,\nwhen great enemies clash,\nthe fate of the state and the lives of the people\nrest upon a single general—\nhow could this not be of utmost weight?\n\nThough the arts of strategy and calculation,\nthe cleverness of schemes and tactics,\nare not the pursuits of the virtuous,\nyet to uphold Heaven’s mandate in punishing rebels\nand to wield great righteousness in relieving the people\nis not to shun extraordinary means to victory.\n\nThus, military strategy includes:\nambushes and covert raids,\nexploiting fatigue and exhaustion,\ndividing and sowing discord,\nfeigning weakness to deceive,\nmoving like ghosts and spirits in the unseen.\nUsing the strange in warfare,\none is undefeated in battle,\nunconquered in assault,\nspilling no blood,\ndraining no wealth,\nwhile the people live long in a land of order,\nenjoying eternal peace—\nhow could this not be the Way of Non-Action?\n\nYet to unite mountains and rivers under one rule,\nto merge heaven and earth under one sovereignty—\nhow could there be no affairs at all?\nBut if one lets all things unfold naturally\nwhile maintaining an unshaken, composed heart,\nthen naturally one harmonizes with Heaven,\nand Heaven’s favor descends;\none is revered by the people,\nand all under heaven willingly submits.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The sages of Tang and Yu governed with a cup of wine,\nwhile Tang and Wu conquered with a single move on the board.\"*\n\nOnly when one does not covet the world\ncan one take the world without effort—\nthus the mind remains undisturbed,\nand one’s capacity matches that of Heaven and Earth.\nTherefore, ruling China and pacifying the barbarians\ncomes effortlessly, as if by fate.\n\nSuch is the Dao of governing the world.\nHow do I know this to be true?\nBecause the Dao of governing the world\nis none other than the Dao of governing oneself—\nthe body is like a state.\nWhat one sees, hears, speaks, and does\nmust conform to ritual;\none’s thoughts and deliberations\nmust align with humaneness.\nNeither internal distractions nor external intrusions\nshould disrupt the settled nature—\nonce the mind is steadied, the body follows suit.\nWhen stillness is cultivated over time,\nHeaven’s natural impulses move on their own.\n\nTo use the ordinary method of nurturing life\nas the alchemical method of reversal,\napproaching the furnace with fire—\nthis is fraught with danger.\nThe Sage likens it to warfare:\none must act according to the times,\nseize opportunities as they arise,\nharvest at the right moment,\nrefine with precision,\nchoose the right terrain for battle,\nand defend with strategy.\nOne must wait for the opportune moment,\nseize the advantage,\nand strike with extraordinary tactics.\n\nAs for stopping the fire when the medicine is sufficient,\nwarming the furnace when the elixir is ripe,\nascending the sun’s essence to the void,\nnurturing the immortal embryo in its unbroken state—\none must still cultivate the divine chamber in stillness,\nremaining utterly detached from all affairs,\nonly then can the elixir be perfected,\nand immortality achieved.\nThis is the Dao of governing oneself—\na metaphor for the achievement of governing the world.\nThus, I know the Dao of governing the world\nthrough the method of governing oneself.\n\nTo take the world requires Non-Action,\nyet to hold the world requires avoiding excess.\nOtherwise, with endless edicts and prohibitions,\nsuspended laws and decrees,\nthe people will grow weary of compliance,\nand corruption will inevitably follow,\nneglecting their duties.\nThus, when laws multiply, the people grow poorer.\n\nGold, jade, pearls, and jewels,\ncarriages, horses, fine clothes—\nthough these are the people’s tools of utility,\nonce greed arises, desire is insatiable,\nand the mind grows clouded,\nthe qi grows turbid.\nSimplicity and sincerity fade,\nwhile deceit and cunning prevail.\nWhen a clever artisan emerges,\npeople admire and emulate them,\nand soon strange and bizarre things fill the courts.\nAlas!\n\nIn the flourishing ages of the Three Dynasties,\nthe rulers were divine and sagely,\nthe people pure and virtuous.\nLaws were enacted but not enforced,\ninstitutions established but not applied—\nthus they were called ages of prosperity.\n\nNow, however, legal nets are vast and dense,\nlike a fine mesh;\nfive-tiered punishments loom heavy,\nwith no mercy for transgressors;\nthree-chapter codes stand severe,\nwith no pardon for offenders.\nYet why, when laws grow stricter,\ndo crimes multiply?\nWhy, when decrees proliferate,\ndo thieves increase?\nIt is because virtue is insufficient to win the people’s hearts,\nand thus laws cannot instill fear in their resolve.\n\nFrom ancient times, those who drove the people to rebellion\nwere never those who lacked such coercive measures.\nThis is evident since the Qin and Han dynasties.\n\nThe ancient Sage said:\n*\"Heaven rules through Non-Action and is thereby honored;\nman rules through Non-Action and is thereby burdened.\"*\nIf I govern with reverence and simplicity,\nnot overwhelming the people with excess,\nnot confusing the state with constant change,\nbut instead maintaining solemnity in the highest halls,\nand stillness in the deepest palaces—\nthen the people will naturally progress toward goodness,\nunaware of who has guided them.\n\n「Yet, with a tranquil heart as my dwelling and profound silence as my defense, I attend solely to the cultivation of sincere intent and the rectification of my mind—\nbut who knows that rectifying one’s own self is the means to rectify the court,\nand rectifying the court is the means to rectify the people?\nAll this arises from that very stillness and composure.\n\nWhen the people are rectified, they honor their own kin and uphold their own elders,\ntransgressing no bounds, and thus their households endure forever.\nThen, they till the fields to eat, dig wells to drink,\nrise with the sun and rest with the moon.\nGranaries overflow with abundance,\nand their every gesture is free from care—\nfor the people grow rich naturally.\n\nSuch is the way when rulers allow things to unfold naturally,\nacting without contrivance,\nand thus the people are transformed and moved by them.\n\nMoreover, in serene repose and quietude,\nwith natural ease and effortless stillness,\none attains the tranquil essence—\nthe *真* (*zhen*, \"true nature\")—\nand the people, in response, will not fail to cultivate the virtues of loyalty and sincerity,\nnor will they lose their innate simplicity and unadorned customs.\n\nThe *Classic of Documents* (*Shu*) states:\n*\"If one person is fundamentally virtuous (*元良*, *yuánliáng*), all nations will stand firm (*贞*, *zhēn*).\"*\nIts principle lies hidden in subtlety,\nyet its effect is manifest in the harmony of Heaven and Earth.\n\nMy wish is that those who seek to govern the world\nfocus first on rectifying the ruler’s heart,\nand those who seek to cultivate their own person\nprioritize nourishing the *天君* (*Tiānjūn*, \"Heavenly Sovereign\"—i.e., the mind).\nThis truth is already clear—\nno need for further elaboration.\n\nIn my reflections on seated meditation (*打坐*, *dǎzuò*), at first,\nthe *阳气* (*yángqì*, \"yang-qi\"—vital, ascending energy) sinks to the depths like the sea,\nas if winter lingered into its final days—\nall around, a profound stillness.\n\nWhen the divine light descends to illuminate,\nit is like the *阳* (*yáng*, \"yang\"—life-giving principle) emerging at the winter solstice,\nyet the silence remains unbroken,\nthe walls stark and empty—\nstill, as before.\n\nFrom this point, the breath of *气机* (*qìjī*, \"qi-movement\") gradually revolves,\nand soon, the three yangs (*三阳*, *sānyáng*) flourish in harmony,\nwhile all things return to the vitality of spring—\nflowers crimson, leaves verdant,\nwater clear and mountains bright—\nthe peak of yang’s vigor is already evident.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is thus.\nWhat is the human body compared to it?\n\nOnly when one tilts the head slightly downward,\nand gazes gently below,\ndoes the *阴极阳生* (*yīnjí yángshēng*, \"yin at its peak gives rise to yang\") manifest.\n\nAt this precise moment,\nit is not like the earlier effort—\ngrasping a single intent\nand counting breaths.\n\nOne must now abandon the *外火* (*wàihuǒ*, \"external fire\"—artificial, forced energy),\nhalt the *内火* (*nèihuǒ*, \"internal fire\"—self-driven effort),\nand let nature take its course without restraint—\nyet not fall into old habits unknowingly.\n\nThis is the cultivation of the *存有觉之心* (*cún yǒu jué zhī xīn*, \"mind aware of inherent existence\")\nto nourish the *无为之性* (*wúwéi zhī xìng*, \"nature of Non-Action\").\n\nWhen awareness and illumination endure long,\nand righteousness and benevolence mature,\nwhat need remains for cultivation or restraint?\nOne need only abide in the natural order.\n\nOtherwise, if at the outset one does not exert effort,\nthe wild monkey and untamed horse\nmay prove difficult to subdue in time.\n\nEven when they come to submit,\none must not, as Mencius warned,\n*\"tie the pig after it has entered the pen\"* (*放豚入苙*, *fàng tún rù yǒu*—i.e., impose rigid control once harmony is achieved).\nTo do so would only make them restless and uneasy,\nforcing them back into resistance.\n\nWhat then is the proper method?\nThe *I Ching* (*易*, *Yì*) says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth in their natural state,\nand all things transform into purity.\"* (*天地絪缊，万物化醇* *Tiāndì gǒu yún, wànwù huà chún*)\n\n「If this *gǒu yún* [絪缊] qi is cultivated within the body,\nit is like stilling the inner fire and outer form,\nremaining motionless and undivided,\nallowing the breath to flow naturally.\n\nFor those whose practice is pure and refined,\none need not consciously hold onto it—\nbut if this stage has not yet been reached,\nthe mind of awareness must never be forgotten.\n\nIf forgotten, one risks drifting into habitual tendencies,\nunaware of the ceaseless arising and passing of thoughts—\nendless cycles of birth and death—\nuntil the original, untainted essence\nis swallowed by the very mind of generation and annihilation.\n\nThe ancient Buddhas taught:\n*\"Know the source of arising,\nand you know the source of ceasing.\"*\n\nThus, one must nurture this awareness,\nuntil over time the origins of arising and ceasing are seen,\nand then, over time again, the state before any thought arises is glimpsed—\nonly then is it attained.\n\nAs for the teachings of the Yellow Court [黃庭],\nthey speak of neither presence nor absence,\nneither inner nor outer;\nyet they are also within the body of form,\nyet not entirely within it.\n\nWhere lies this subtle secret?\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Concentrate the mind in emptiness,\nand merge the qi in the boundless.\"*\n\nTo concentrate the mind in emptiness,\nand merge the qi in the boundless,\nis like dwelling in the elixir field [丹田],\nyet not fixating the gaze inward to observe,\nnor forcing the mind and qi to cling within.\n\nOnly by focusing the mind at the navel’s lower region,\nnot far from the flesh and skin,\ndoes one achieve the \"neither inner nor outer\" state.\n\nDirecting intention there,\none feels the breath at mouth and nostrils cease,\nwhile the elixir field’s qi\nrolls and swells in the space where inner and outer meet,\nknotted into a singular whole—\ntruly *gǒu yún* [絪絪缊缊],\nundifferentiated and pure,\neffortlessly rising and falling,\nin perfect accord with Heaven’s primordial qi,\nuninterrupted and seamless.\n\nHere, essence, qi, and spirit are born,\nclose to the divine—\nthis is the \"merging qi in the boundless\" teaching.\n\nThe ancients called it *\"primal qi\"* [元气],\n*\"embryonic breath\"* [胎息],\nor *\"the True Person’s breath reaching the heels\"* [真人之息以踵].\nWhat else could it be?\n\nThe *\"primal qi\"* is that undefiled breath\nwithin the boundless, formless void—\na single, pure exhalation, clear and empty.\n\nThe *\"embryonic breath\"* is this:\nwhen one first receives qi in the womb,\nthe body is nourished there,\nmouth and nostrils yet unopened—\nhow then does it take in breath to live?\n\nOnly this navel-field qi,\ncommuning with the mother’s navel-wheel [脐轮],\nis why the child grows daily.\n\nWhen the cry of birth pierces the earth,\nand life begins outside the womb,\nthis qi flows in and out through the mouth and nostrils—\nthis is the *\"each establishes their own heaven and earth\"* [各立乾坤] principle.\n\nI show that the navel-wheel’s qi\nmeets the external Heavenly breath,\nneither fully inner nor outer,\n*gǒu yún* [絪缊] and mingled—\na seamless fusion—\nwhich is to return to the moment of first receiving qi,\nand reconnect with the mother’s breath—\nthis is the embryonic breath.\n\nThe *\"True Person’s breath reaching the heels\"* means:\nthe True Person’s breath is stored deeply,\nspreads subtly,\ninvisible, inaudible, untouchable—\ndeep and profound,\nlike qi extending to the soles of the feet.\n\nThe breath of mouth and nostrils is not useless,\nbut it must be allowed to act naturally;\none cannot rely solely on it for inhalation and exhalation.\nIf one uses only this breath\nwithout first focusing the mind\nat the navel’s lower region—\none inch and three *fēn* [分] below the flesh—\nand seeking this void within the void,\nto draw Heavenly qi into the infinite,\nthe result will be a mingling of purity and turbidity,\nmaking alchemical refinement impossible.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Heaven generates people with the One Primal Qi [一元真气],\nwhich is neither mouth nor nostrils,\nnor the subtle, sentient soul [灵] of knowing and moving.\"*\n\nThey also said:\n*\"The Mysterious Feminine Gate [玄牝之门] few know,\nDo not waste breath through mouth and nostrils.\nThough you practice inhalation and exhalation for a thousand ages,\nHow could you ever grasp the Golden Rooster seizing the Rabbit?\"*\n[金乌搦兔儿]\n\nFrom these few lines alone,\nit is clear that *\"emerging from the Mysterious,\nentering the Feminine\"* [出玄入牝]\nrefers to the space\none inch and three *fēn* [分] below the navel,\nwhere the qi *yīn yīn yūn yūn* [氤氤氲氲],\ncondenses into a single mass.\n\nThose who study the Dao,\nwhether at meal times or in idle conversation,\nmust subtly direct a little intention,\nfocusing the mind in the void’s single orifice—\nnaturally merging qi in the boundless,\nand seeing the True Qi move,\nin ineffable wonder.\n\nYet in this breath regulation,\none knows the mind does not enter within,\nand the Water of the Abyss [坎水] naturally clarifies.\n\nThis is the unspoken secret of generations of immortals and sages.\nI now reveal it plainly—\nlater scholars must not dismiss it as empty words.\n\n**Chapter 58: Calamity, Fortune’s Shadow**\nIts governance is muted and unassuming,\nits people pure and refined.\n\nIts governance is sharp and scrutinizing,\nits people restless and deficient.\n\nCalamity, fortune’s leaning post;\nFortune, calamity’s hidden root.\nWho knows their ultimate measure?\nWhen the upright becomes the strange,\nwhen the good becomes the demonic.\n\nThe people’s delusion has endured long.\n\nThus, the sage\nis square without cutting,\nhonest without rigidity,\nstraight without excess,\nbright without blinding.\n\nHeaven and Earth transform without intent,\nthe sovereign rules without action.\nThis Way of Non-Action\nis the great principle and law\nby which the sage opened Heaven and Earth,\nunified the world and ordered all things.\n\nThe ruler governs all people,\nregulates all affairs—\nnothing surpasses this.\n\nIf one indulges in action,\ngovernance is not true governance,\nrule is not true rule.\nThough their writings gleam and their deeds shine,\nthey cannot achieve the harmonious, luminous state\nwhere all rejoice in the flourishing and abundant transformation.\n\nThus, the *Tàishàng* [太上] says:\n*\"Governance is the rectification of the self\"* [政者正也],\nto correct others’ deviations with one’s own rectitude.\n\nSince ancient times,\nthose who govern the people\nhave established human norms,\nregulated Heaven’s order—\nwhether knowing or seeming ignorant,\nwhether acting or seeming inaction,\nall let Heaven’s spontaneity move freely.\n\nAt first, there is no arbitrary cleverness,\nno inventing of measures or rigid rules,\nno hanging of laws or reading of edicts—\nyet through the power of virtue,\na silent resonance arises beyond words.\n\n---\n\nThus, their governance is **mùn-mùn** [闷闷], as if a simpleton without knowledge.\nYet the people’s trust and faith [感孚] are also **chún-chún** [淳淳], bearing the pristine winds of antiquity, unchanged in the slightest.\n\nThe ruler governs through **wúwéi** [无为], the people transform through **wúwéi** [无为].\nAbove and below share in the tranquil **Tian** [天] of no affairs,\nresting in grandeur—how magnificent!\n\nIf the ruler strives with diligence [励精图治], exhausts his strength in governance [竭力谋为],\nremoves the wicked and evil [拔去凶邪], elevates the virtuous and talented [登崇俊杰],\nrecords even minor kindnesses [小善必录], punishes great offenses [大过必惩],\nand dispenses rewards and penalties without distinction—clear as ice and sharp as a mirror [赏罚无殊冰镜],\nhis oversight stern as divine judgment [监观俨若神明],\nthen his governance is **chá-chá** [察察], none escaping his discerning gaze [藻鉴].\nIs this not weighty indeed?\n\nYet when the ruler demands excessive scrutiny [好苛求],\nthe people respond with cunning artifice [化为机巧],\nfragile and hollow, each boasting their petty wisdom [缺缺然无不以小智自矜].\nThe ruler acts through **yǒuwéi** [有为], the people conform through **yǒuwéi** [有为],\nand woeful is the difficulty of governing the people’s hearts!\n\nFor if the ruler does not purify the source [清其源],\nthen the people cannot rectify their roots [正其本].\n\nIndeed, **wúwéi** [无为] is the **Tàishàng** [太上]’s original, undivided **zhēn** [真].\n**Yǒuwéi** [有为] is the later, contrived **wéi** [伪].\nThe effects of **mùn-mùn** [闷闷] and **chá-chá** [察察] are thus utterly contrasting.\n\nThis is the **Dao** [道]—one alone, two is not.\nYet when the **Tàiji** [太极] of **xiāntiān** [先天] remains undifferentiated,\npure and undivided, there is no **yīnyáng** [阴阳] to name,\nno **shàn’è** [善恶] to perceive.\nThe *Yìjīng* [《易》] says:\n*\"The simple is easily known, the unadorned is easily followed\"* [易则易知，简则易从],\nthus making governance vast and enduring.\n\nIf the **Tàipú** [太朴] of **hòutiān** [后天] is incomplete,\n**yīnyáng** [阴阳] permeates its beginning and end,\nand misfortune and fortune alternate as hidden dependencies [互祸福为倚伏],\nwith fortune within misfortune and misfortune within fortune,\nthen the cycle of **huòfú** [祸福] turns endlessly.\n\nThus, **yǒuwéi** [有为] is not necessarily unvirtuous,\nbut when things reach their limit, they transform;\nwhen time reaches its extreme, it reverses.\nThe mechanism of **yīnyáng** [阴阳]’s interplay is inherently such.\nWho knows the **dǐjí** [底级] and can steadfastly maintain the **zhèng** [正]?\n\nMoreover, the **zhèng** [正] inverted becomes the **qí** [奇],\nthe **shàn** [善] repeated becomes the **yāo** [妖].\nGovernance through **wúwéi** [无为] is pure **Tian** [天].\nGovernance through **yǒuwéi** [有为] is mixed with **rén** [人].\nMixed with **rén** [人], the **zhèng** [正] contains the **qí** [奇],\nthe **shàn** [善] harbors the **yāo** [妖].\nIts origins lie in subtle shifts [隐微],\nits responses arise swiftly from echoes [影响],\nand its momentum is indeed relentless [不容稍闲].\nNo wonder deceit and guile [尔虞我诈] become habitual,\na nature so ingrained that none awaken to it.\nThe days of this state have long passed.\n\nThus, the **Sage** [圣人] rules the **empire** [宇],\nrooted in the **Dao** [道] of **wúwéi** [无为],\nordering his own conduct while guiding the people,\nrectifying himself to transform others.\nHis **fāng** [方] is so natural that it seems no **fāng** [方] at all—\nperhaps he attains **biàn** [变] and **tōng** [通] without recourse to artificial measures [裁截]?\nHis **lián** [廉] is so thorough that he forgets its existence—\nperhaps he merges with the **sú** [俗] while remaining luminous and unblemished [和光不伤]?\nHis **zhí** [直] is upright, yet he neither blindly acquiesces [唯诺] nor recklessly follows his own desires [径情].\nHe adheres to principle and practice [认理行持], never daring to indulge himself.\nHis **gěnggài** [梗概] and **fēngguī** [风规] are truly worthy of reverence and awe.\n\nAs for his **transformation** [化] of all living beings,\nhis **en** [恩] extends to the four quarters—\nnearly rivaling the radiance of stars and clouds,\nvying with the heavens for brilliance—\nyet he alone conceals his traces, never flaunting them.\nHow does he vanish his presence and extinguish his voice?\n\nThis is **wúwéi** [无为] as essence, **zìrán** [自然] as function.\nTo govern by aligning with desires [从欲以治],\nto act by applying principle [须理以施],\nso that the winds of the four directions move,\nand none fail to flourish in the **yōng** [雍] of transformation,\nall partaking in the **Tàigǔ** [太古]’s **Tian** [天].\nIs this not the case?\n\nThe **Dao** [道] is called the **Dàdào** [大道],\n**elixir** [丹] is called the **Jīndān** [金丹],\nyet both are beyond **name** [名] and **xiàng** [象].\nIn **Tian** [天], it is the **qīngkōng** [清空] of **yīqì** [一气].\nIn **rén** [人], it is the **xūwú** [虚无] of **zìrán** [自然].\nFrom **xiūliàn** [修炼]’s beginning to end,\nits core remains no other than this.\n\nIf a person knows the **chōngmò** [冲漠] without traces is the **root of the Dao** [大道根源],\nthe **origin of the elixir** [金丹本始],\nand from the **extreme of emptiness and profound stillness** [虚极静笃]\nnurtures a **hún-hún** [浑浑] **lún-lún** [沦沦] state,\nfree from **knowledge** [知识] and **pènglǜ** [念虑],\nthen my **xìngqíng** [性情], **jīngqì** [精气], and **shén** [神]\nare all matters of **xiāntiān** [先天]’s **Tàihé** [太和] **yīqì** [一气].\nTo **xiūdào** [修道] is to achieve **Dào** [道],\nto **liàndān** [炼丹] is to perfect the **elixir** [丹],\nand what is strange or perilous to fear?\n\nBut if one does not know **wúwéi** [无为] as the **foundation** [本],\nand merely takes **yǒuwéi** [有为] as merit [功],\nthen **knowledge** [知识] never ceases,\nand **fēnráo** [纷扰] grows ever more.\nHow could one not fall into the **hòutiān** [后天]’s **yǒuxíng** [有形] **yǒusè** [有色] **záwàng** [杂妄]?\n\nThe **Tàishàng** [太上] likens governance to the **Dao** [道],\nand the people to the **body** [身].\nWhen the **Dao** [道] refines **xiāntiān** [先天]’s **wúwéi** [无为],\nit achieves the **unspoiled golden body** [不坏金身].\nWhen the **Dao** [道] refines **hòutiān** [后天]’s **yǒushí** [有识],\nhow could it not result in the **duōyuán** [二元] **shén** [神]?\n\nEven if refined well,\nit is but the **shǒushíguǐ** [守尸鬼]—\nhow could it transcend **yīnyáng** [阴阳],\nescape **shēngsǐ** [生死],\nand eternally become the **immortal** [神仙] of all ages?\n\nAnd yet, once one falls into **yǒuwéi** [有为],\nthe **Tàiji** [太极] is divided, and **yīnyáng** [阴阳] arises.\n**Yīnyáng** [阴阳] separates, and **shàn’è** [善恶] emerges,\nwith **huòfú** [祸福] then interchanging.\nWho knows that the **extreme refinement** [极功] of **Dao** cultivation,\nthough it may involve a **step of life-preservation** [炼命],\nis not without the **use of yǒuwéi** [有为]?\nYet it must be through **yǒuyòng** [有用] to reach **wúyòng** [无用],\nand through **yǒugōng** [有功] to attain **wúgōng** [无功],\nonly then does one avoid the **biānjì** [边际].\n\nMencius says: *\"There must be affairs to attend to, but do not cling to them\"* [必有事焉而勿正].\nThe **key to cultivation** [修道之要] lies precisely here.\n\nDiscussing the **human heart** [人心], one motion brings one stillness,\none **yīn** [阴] brings one **yáng** [阳].\n**Yé** [邪] and **zhèng** [正], **shàn** [善] and **è** [恶]\nare inherently cyclical, interdependent,\nand ceaseless in their coming and going.\nThus, where there is **zhèng** [正], there is **yé** [邪],\nand where there is **shàn** [善], there is **è** [恶].\nOnly when one returns to **húnwàng** [浑忘],\nundivided and unseparated,\nis there no **shàn’è** [善恶].\n\nOtherwise, **zhèng** [正] inverted becomes **qí** [奇],\n**shàn** [善] repeated becomes **yāo** [妖].\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"Heaven honors **wúwéi** [无为] as supreme,\nwhile mortals burden themselves with **yǒuwéi** [有为].\"*\n\nThus, even in the **time of yǒuwéi** [有为],\none must ultimately return to **wúwéi** [无为]\nto avoid the **peril of tilting the cauldron** [倾丹倒鼎].\n\nAlas, the common folk and vulgar scholars of this world\nspeak of **elixir** [丹] yet cling to the **dāntián** [丹田];\nobstinately fixate on the **Héchē** [河车]’s path,\nrestricting themselves to the **body** [身]’s form—\ntheir **understanding of wúwéi** [无为]’s essence has long been lost.\n\n「Only the sage understands the Dao/Way of cultivation and refinement.\nThough there are fire and stages, medicines and substances,\nDragon and Tiger, male and female,\ncauldrons and furnaces, zithers and swords—\nall manner of names and forms—\nthey are like the nets and snares used for catching fish and rabbits:\n*When fish and rabbits are not yet obtained,*\n*one must employ the nets and snares;*\n*When fish and rabbits are secured,*\n*the nets and snares are forgotten.*\n\nIf one clings to names and forms,\nall are not the Dao/Way.\n\nThus, *when square, be square,*\n*when chaste, be chaste,*\n*when upright, be upright,*\n*when bright, be bright—*\nyet all must be wúwéi [无为],\nshìwúshì [事无事],\nreturning to the undivided **húnwàng** [浑忘] of Heaven.\n\nLet the scholar take the Dao/Way of wúwéi [无为] as natural essence,\nestablishing essence first before applying it in practice.\nEven with **yǒuwéi** [有为],\nit remains wúwéi [无为].\n\nDo you know this?\nDo you believe this?\n\n**Chapter 59: Long-Life and Everlasting Vision**\nTo govern humanity and serve Heaven,\nnothing surpasses **sè** [啬].\nFor **sè** [啬] is the early **fú** [服].\nEarly **fú** [服] is called **chóngjī dé** [重积德].\n**Chóngjī dé** [重积德] conquers all.\nTo conquer all is to know no limits;\nto know no limits is to have a realm.\nA realm that endures is long-lasting.\nThis is called the Dao/Way of **shēngén jiǔshì** [长生久视],\ndeep-rooted and firmly established.\n\nThe Dao/Way of governing humanity is the same as serving Heaven—\nfor humanity and Heaven are fundamentally one **qi** [气].\nThus, serving Heaven does not go beyond governing humanity.\nDo not say Heaven’s Dao/Way is distant—\nit resides within humanity’s Dao/Way, so near.\n\nIf one does not know Heaven’s Dao/Way,\nfirst observe the human heart.\nTo exhaust all human affairs is to align with Heaven’s Dao/Way.\nThough high and low differ greatly,\nas long as one prioritizes **ānmín** [安民],\nHeaven’s heart unifies when the people are settled.\n\nIts essence lies in valuing agriculture and the roots—\nteaching the people to till and reap first.\nFor the people are the foundation of the state,\nand food is their Heaven.\nOnce **sè** [啬] is practiced,\nclothing and food will be abundant,\nand the body and family will be secure.\n\nAs Mencius said:\n*\"Plant the five grains, and when the five grains are ripe, the people will flourish.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"The sage governs the world,\nmaking grain and rice as plentiful as water and fire—\nhow could the people fail to be kind?\"*\n\nThus, those who lead must urgently embrace **sè** [啬],\nso the people may engage in joyful labor and dwell in peace,\nnurturing life and honoring death.\n\nThere are those who, unseen and unheard,\nearly cultivate the hearts of the people,\nwho delight in their devotion as if feasting on the finest sacrificial meats.\nThis is **not speaking of virtue/power** [修德] yet virtue/power is cultivated,\n**not speaking of upholding virtue/power** [尚德] yet virtue/power is upheld.\n\nEven when plowing one-third of the land yields one harvest,\nand plowing nine-tenths yields three harvests—\nwhen grain and millet abound,\nto make wine and sacrificial drinks,\nto offer to ancestors and kin,\nto perform all rites—\nthe virtue/power [德] thus accumulated is profound and weighty.\nWho else but this can claim such virtue/power?\n\nSo, opening the Dao/Way of Heaven with great benevolence,\nbestowing boundless blessings,\nnaturally aids the weak and attacks the benighted,\noverthrows chaos and rescues the lost—\nand conquers all it encounters.\n\nThus, all it faces are swept aside,\nno one dares to meet in battle.\nNot only does it pacify neighboring states,\nbut even distant lands and strange realms\nare blessed with timely rains and harmonious relations.\n\nEastward it spreads, westward it advances,\nnorthward it reaches, southward it connects—\nits teachings extend to all four directions,\nand who can know its limits?\n\nSince it knows no limits,\nthe **imperial Dao/Way** [帝道] flourishes far and wide,\nthe **imperial vision** [皇图] is firmly established,\nand the realm is secured.\n\nThe *Book of Han* states:\n*\"The Yellow River flows like a belt,\nand Mount Tai gleams like a whetstone.\nThe realm endures in lasting peace,\nand love extends to all descendants.\"*\n\nIndeed, there is no deviation here.\n\nWhen humanity governs a realm,\nit has the means to obtain one—\nand what is that means?\nIt is the **mother-qi** [母气] of the realm.\nIf there is no mother-qi,\nhow could one obtain a realm?\n\nThis is the fundamental ground—\nwhat humanity should urgently study.\n\nBefore obtaining a realm,\none must seek the mother;\nonce a realm is obtained,\none must cherish the mother.\nA realm’s mother is like a tree’s root,\nor water’s source—\nit endures long and never ceases.\nThis Dao/Way of governing the world\nalso applies to refining the body.\n\nThe scholar who practices the Dao/Way\ncan maintain **zhōngbǎo yī** [中抱一],\nconcentrate the breath, and regulate the spirit—\nfirst seeking **yǒngzǐ** [汞子] to find **qiānmǔ** [铅母],\nthen nurturing **qiānmǔ** [铅母] with **yǒngzǐ** [汞子],\nuntil **qiān** [铅] and **yǒng** [汞] unite,\nchild and mother merge,\nreturning to the original,\nreverting to **tàipǔ** [太朴].\nThis is called the Dao/Way of **shēngén jiǔshì** [长生久视],\ndeep-rooted and firmly established.\n\nThus, one becomes **saintly** [圣] though ordinary,\n**Heavenly** [天] though human.\n\nThe Dao/Way of refining the body\nis not different from governing the world.\nThis is to govern humanity and serve Heaven,\nto exhaust all human affairs and align with Heaven’s Dao/Way.\nAs it is said:\n*\"Humanity and Heaven are fundamentally one qi,\nmutually responsive and harmonious.\nThe yang comes from the void above,\nembracing me as master and sovereign.\"*\n\nThis is not an easy matter.\n\nIts Dao/Way lies in **xūwú** [虚无],\nits practice akin to tilling and reaping.\nFirst, one **stores and nurtures**, **reflects and examines** [存养省察],\nthen **guides the nature to encompass emotions** [以性摄情].\nWhen **water and fire merge** [水火混融],\nand **kan and li harmonize** [坎离和合],\nthe **preheaven qi** [先天气] moves,\ncirculating through the **zhou tiān** [周天].\nAs it is said:\n*\"When the union of Heaven and Earth ceases,\na single point descends into the Yellow Court.\"*\n\nThis is to draw **kanzhōng zhī huáng** [坎中之潢],\nfilling the **void within li** [离中之虚].\nThus, the foundation of life is fortified,\nand the **virtue/power of immortality** [人仙之功] is achieved.\n\nThis is like the practitioner of **sè** [啬]\nwho opens fields and clears land,\nplows and harvests—\nonly then can one sow and cultivate the five grains.\n\nFrom this, one further takes the **yin essence from li** [离中阴精],\nsending it down into the **kan palace** [坎户].\nThen, one merges the **yang qi from kan** [坎中阳气]\nwith the **yin essence from li** [离中阴精],\nforming a single family,\nseeding it in the **dāntián** [丹田] as medicine.\n*\"When others have none, I possess it;\nwhen others are empty, I am full.\"*\n\nWait until true **qiānmǔ** [铅母] arises here—\nthen, with **yang qiān** [阳铅], one restrains **yin yǒng** [阴汞],\nso its **flying nature** [好飞者] does not scatter;\nand with **yin qiān** [阴铅], one nurtures **yang qiān** [阳铅],\nso its **sinking disposition** [好沉者] does not descend.\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality* [《悟真》] says:\n*\"In the golden cauldron, retain the scarlet mercury,\nIn the jade pool, first descend the silver from the water.\"*\n\nWhen the **qiān** [铅] and **yǒng** [汞] fly and float,\nlike dust particles in sunlight streaming through a clear window,\neach drifting away—\nuntil the **residual yang from kan** [坎府外之余阳] is fully absorbed,\nreturning to the **li palace** [离宫],\nand the **private yǒng** [阴汞] and **personal recognition** [私识] are completely digested,\nrestoring the **pure yang treasure** [纯阳至宝] of the elixir.\nThis can ascend to the **Hàn** [汉] and pierce the heavens,\nfly with the spirits and walk among the saints—\nwhen the **shén tāi** [神胎] is formed,\nand the **xiān yīng** [仙婴] is complete.\n\n「Though the practice is not easily attained! One must first **cultivate resolve and nourish qi** [持志养气], like a farmer plowing and weeding—\nnot without toil and hardship.\nYet in the end, the **spirit is tranquil, the qi settled** [神闲气定].\n\nWithin, the **single principle** [一理] is complete and undivided;\nwithout, one adapts to circumstances, ever balanced.\nThis is not a fleeting act—\nit aligns with the **Dao/Way** [大道] when truly undertaken.\n\nThrough refining **nature** [修性] and tempering **life-force** [炼命],\none has already prepared the **submissive guest** [以宾服后起] to meet future causes,\nand all burdens vanish, leaving no trace behind.\nOne fulfills **human virtue** [人道] to merge with **heavenly power** [天德],\nnot something achieved in mere morning or evening.\n\nLike a nation’s governance,\nit rests on **sincere integrity** [赤诚求],\n**deep compassion and abundant virtue** [深仁厚德],\nrooted in the people’s hearts,\npenetrating to the marrow—\nits virtue accumulates without end,\nits weight knows no limit.\n\nThus, what one seeks to **exclude** [无不除] is never left undone,\nwhat one strives to **overcome** [克] is never left unattained.\nWith **heavenly embrace serene and settled** [天怀淡定],\none walks the **Five Phases** [五] in calm assurance.\nWhether in **change** [处变] or **constancy** [处常],\none moves in **preordained station** [素位],\nnever without **finding ease in all things** [无入而不自得].\n\nIf one applies this to **refine nature** [炼性], **nature is perfected** [性尽];\nif to **cultivate life-force** [修命], **life-force stands firm** [命立].\n\nIn the **void of boundless emptiness** [冲漠无朕],\nall **phenomena** [万象] rise in full array—\ntruly, there is none who knows its ultimate depths.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* [太上] says:\n*\"Internally observe the heart, yet the heart has no heart.\nExternally observe the body, yet the body has no body.\nDistant observation of all things, yet things have no things.\nEmpty of all that is empty, void of all that is void—\nthere is no void, nor is there any that is not void.\"*\n\nThose who can **awaken to this** [悟], may **transmit the sacred path** [传圣道].\nThis is the **\"externalizing the body yet the body remains\"** [外其身而身存]—\nthe **body as a nation** [身犹国也].\n\nJust as a **sage-ruler governs without action** [王者无为而治],\nyet stands upright at the **southern face** [正南面],\nand holds **nation and world** [有国有天下].\n\nSimilarly, **yin essence** [阴精] resides within one,\nlong mingled with the **father’s essence** [父精] and **mother’s blood** [母血].\nWithout the **primordial yang qi** [先天阳气],\nit cannot **self-generate and grow** [自生自长].\n\nFor **postnatal yin essence** [后天阴精],\nits origin is from **primordial qi** [先天],\nbut **yin essence is hard to retain** [阴精难固],\nand **emotions and desires are easily unsettled** [情欲易摇].\nWithout the **earthly-heavenly external yang qi** [天地外来灵阳之气],\none cannot **condense and form the elixir** [结而成丹],\nnor achieve **immortality and non-death** [长生不死].\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The mother of a lasting realm,\ncan endure forever.\"*\n\nOnly the **sage** [圣人] unites **true yin and true yang** [真阴真阳],\nthe two **qi** into **one** [一气],\nand **refines** [煅] a **drop of millet** [黍米]—\nthis is called **golden elixir** [金丹],\n**true qiān** [真铅],\nand the **White Tiger’s First Scripture** [白虎首经].\nIts essence is none other than **primordial qi** [先天一气].\n\nFrom the **form-body** [色身], through **endless refining and washing** [千烧万炼，千磨万洗],\ngradually **extracting and condensing** [渐采渐凝],\nsometimes **simmering, sometimes refining** [时烹时炼],\nthe **golden elixir** [金丹] is formed—\n**luminous and complete** [英英有象],\nthe **so-called \"stealing the earthly-heavenly qi to use as elixir base\"** [人盗天地之气以为丹母].\n\nThis is the **rooted and enduring path** [深根蒂固],\nof **long life and lasting vision** [长生久视].\n\nTo **combine the earthly-heavenly luminous yang** [天地灵阳]\nwith **one’s own true qi** [一己真气],\nand **form the sacred embryo** [结成圣胎],\nthe ancient **Daoist immortals** [仙] say:\n*\"When the **primordial yang first stirs** [先天一阳初动],\none **moves a drop of innate mercury** [运一点己汞] to greet it.\"*\n\nThus, **inner contact and outer stimulation** [内触外激] yield **form** [有象],\n**outer contact and inner resonance** [外触内感] bring **spirit** [有灵].\nLike **magnet attracting iron** [磁吸铁],\nthey **naturally align** [自然吻合].\n\nThe **mercury child** [汞子] **constructs the water palace** [造水府],\nseeking the **qiān mother** [求铅母].\nOnce the **mother is obtained** [得其母],\nit **relies on the child** [复依其子].\n\n**Child and mother in harmony** [子母和谐],\n**clustered in the central palace** [团结中宫],\nthe **great elixir is complete** [大丹成],\nand the **path of immortality is realized** [神仙证].\n\nThe **beginning and end, root and branch** [本末] of elixir refinement,\nthe *Tàishàng* [太上] has already **exhaustively taught** [道尽].\nScholars must **attend closely and grasp its meaning** [细心体会].\nThough **traces and symbols may seem similar** [迹象虽相似],\nthere are **great distinctions in essence and refinement** [精粗大有分别].\n\nYet until the **right moment** [其时] arrives,\none cannot **know** [知].\nWithout a **true teacher’s guidance** [真师指授],\nthere is no way to **illuminate** [明].\n\nThis requires **heavenly, earthly, and human connections** [天缘地缘人缘],\nthe **three causes converging** [三缘凑合],\nbefore one may **enter the chamber and begin work** [入室行工].\n\nLater scholars must first **accumulate sincerity and cultivate virtue** [积诚修德],\n**empty oneself to seek a teacher** [虚己求师],\nonly then may the **three causes be united** [结三缘] and entry gained.\nDo not **take joy in mere attainment** [一得自喜],\nfor then there will be **no aspiration to ascend** [无向上之志].\n\n**Resolutely pledge and surrender** [矢志投诚],\n**with all strength pressing forward** [一力前进],\n**step by step, unceasingly** [迤逦做去]—\nthis is acceptable.\n\nAt the very outset of practice,\nthere is **no crack to enter, no gap to seize** [无缝可入，无隙可乘],\njust as **chewing wax pills** [咀嚼蜡丸]—\n**bland and tasteless** [淡泊无味].\n\nZhū Zǐ [朱子] says:\n*\"In learning, one must **strive with vigor** [猛奋],\n**endure patience in self-realization** [体认耐烦辛].\nToil through the day,\nand in time, **bitterness yields to sweetness** [苦尽甘来],\n**suppression gives birth to joy** [闷极乐生]—\nthen **the Dao advances and the mind finds clarity** [道进而心有得].\n\nAt this juncture,\nwhen **principle and desire ride together** [理欲杂乘],\nand **heavenly and human forces clash** [天人交战],\nit is most difficult to act.\n\nIts **advance and retreat** [进退] hinge on this **passage** [关].\nIf this **passage is broken through** [关攻得破],\nthen **Confucius’ words hold true**:\n*\"The splendor of the ancestral temple,\nthe wealth of all officials,\nthe endless enjoyment of rewards\"* [宗庙之美，百官之富，赏玩之不置].\n\nDo not **wilt and falter** [萎靡不振],\nnor **let one’s own spirit weaken** [自家精神放弱],\nfor then one will **never enter the gate** [终身不得其门而入] in this lifetime.\n\nMost importantly,\n**empty the mind** [虚其心],\n**expand the resolve** [大其志],\n**stir the spirit** [鼓其神],\nand **establish virtue and function** [立德立功],\n**refine nature and temper life-force** [修性修命].\n\nKnow that this is the **greatest matter between heaven and earth** [天地间第一大事],\nand without **great strength** [大力量], it cannot be accomplished.\n\nIn days past, there was a couplet:\n*\"Brace iron shoulders to bear **Daoist rectitude** [道义],\nUnfurl trembling hands to craft **sacred texts** [文章].\"*\n\nAh!\nEven in the world,\na **single talent or skill** [一材一艺],\nor the **pursuit of minor scholarly fame** [小小科名],\nrequires **toil and endurance** [辛苦耐烦].\nTo **achieve great deeds and virtues** [大功德],\none must **employ a full measure of true spirit** [满腹真精神],\nonly then may **heaven and the divine favor** [神天默佑] be invoked,\nand **its fruits observed** [观厥成].\nHow much more so for the **Dao** [道],\nthe **greatest matter of heaven** [天大一件事]!\n\nThus the **Buddha** [佛] says:\n*\"I descended into this realm for the **great cause and connection** [大事因缘].*\n*So too do I.\"*\n\nScholars who have **met a true teacher** [遇真师],\nmust **grasp my words with sincere heart and true intent** [以真心诚意体认],\nonly then may they be counted as **great men of the world** [人间大大丈夫].\n\n**Chapter Sixty: Two Do Not Harm Each Other**\nTo govern a **great realm** [大国] is like **cooking fresh delicacies** [烹小鲜].\nTo **apply the Dao to the world** [莅天下],\nits **spirits are not uncanny** [其鬼不神].\n\nIt is not that its **spirits are not uncanny** [其鬼不神],\nbut that its **spirit does not harm** [其神不伤人].\nIt is not that its **spirit does not harm** [其神不伤人],\nbut that the **sage also does not harm** [圣人亦不伤人].\n\nBecause **two do not harm each other** [两不相伤],\n**virtue returns in mutual accord** [故德交归焉].\n\nThe **Dao** [道] is the **shared principle** [共有之理]\nof all **heaven and earth, beings and things** [天下人物].\nTo **refine oneself with this principle** [修身],\nis to **govern the world with this principle** [治世].\n\nTo establish oneself is to establish others; to reach oneself is to reach others.\nWithout waiting for a change of thought, without needing to delay time—how easy and simple it is!\n\nThus, the **Supreme Sage** said: *\"To govern a great realm is like cooking fresh delicacies.\"*\n\nWhen a realm is great, its affairs must be numerous, its people many. If one does not grasp the **Dao**, then matters will inevitably become chaotic and convoluted—like trying to untangle disordered silk, the more one tries to govern, the more tangled it becomes.\n\nOnly by refining oneself with the **Dao** shared by all—governing the multitude with this same principle—do the **principles** align, the **qi** flow uninterrupted, and the governance become effortlessly effective.\n\nOtherwise, relying solely on laws, decrees, stratagems, and technical measures to command the world—when openly enforced, it breeds resentment among the people, and their hearts grow deceitful and multifarious; when secretly imposed, it provokes the wrath of the **spirits**, and calamities and disasters multiply.\n\nFor humans are the sovereigns of **ghosts and spirits**. When rulers impose heavy taxes and cruel tyranny, leaving the people with no refuge, then **ghosts and spirits**, lacking any attachment, must stir up omens and portents—famine, pestilence, and misfortune follow inevitably.\n\nThus, the **stone spirit** appeared in **Jin**, the **comet** in **Qi**, the **serpents fought** in **Zheng**, **Bo You** became a vengeful ghost, **Shen Sheng** was haunted by spirits, the **Two Rascals** fell ill beyond cure, **Shen Xin** descended, and **Guo** was destroyed—though these were said to be the work of **ghosts and spirits**, they were truly the result of the ruler’s lack of the **Dao**.\n\nIf those who rule the people truly refine themselves with the **Dao** and transform the people with the **Dao**, then even the most **obscure and stubborn spirits** will naturally gravitate toward them—no grievances arise among the people, no disasters from the **ghosts**. Mountains and rivers remain unscathed, no strange phenomena appear, and all enjoy a flourishing peace.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\n*\"Our ancient kings diligently cultivated their virtue.\nThere were no celestial calamities—mountains, rivers, ghosts, and spirits were all at peace.\"*\n\nIs this not because the **spirits are not uncanny**?\nFor **demons and spirits**, mountain **precincts** and water **monsters**, all depend on some attachment, require their offerings, and follow their natural course without interference. Even if there are **spirits**, they have nothing to manifest; even if they manifest, how could they cause harm?\n\nThus, **yin** and **yang**, humans and **ghosts**, all play and frolic under the bright heavens—how could they harm anyone?\n\nIt is not that the **spirit does not harm**, but that the **Sage**, possessing the **Dao**, lacks the prying intelligence of the overly perceptive and the self-aggrandizing benevolence of the overly sentimental. They carefully refine themselves, uphold natural relationships, maintain reverence in action and simplicity in conduct, avoiding all unnecessary complexity—never causing the slightest harm to others.\n\nWhen **yin** and **yang** are harmonized, the people and all things flourish; when rituals are honored, **ghosts and spirits** are at ease. In the unseen realm, there is no mutual intrusion. Thus, all under heaven willingly submit to the **Sage’s virtue** and return to its accord.\n\nAh! The governance of **non-action** is drawn near from the self and far from all things. The unknowing and unknowing—this is the **Way of the Emperor**. Compared to those who rely on strict decrees and harsh punishments, hoping for diligence through fear—who is more difficult, who is more burdensome? The difference is as vast as heaven and earth!\n\nWhy do people not seek the fundamental principle?\n\nThis is the **great realm** illustrating the **great Dao**, just as **cooking fresh delicacies** illustrates **alchemical refinement**. Fresh delicacies—such as lamb, fish, and meat—are cooked only with soy sauce, vinegar, salt, and plum sauce, balancing the five flavors. Supporting what is deficient, restraining what is excessive, and gently nurturing with warm fire, the flavors emerge naturally over time, pleasing both body and palate.\n\nRefining the **Great Elixir** likewise requires harmonizing the four **symbols**, gathering the five **phases**, making the three **blossoms** converge in one **cauldron** and the five **qi** gather in the central **field**. Then, the natural divine fire slowly nurtures—no need for artificial adjustment, no forced manipulation. It proceeds naturally, and in seven returns and nine revolutions, it is as easy as turning one’s palm.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Slowly tend the alchemical furnace, watching the fire’s nature,\nOnly rest the spirit and let heaven’s work unfold naturally.\"*\n\nHow effortless it is!\n\nThus, the **Dao of non-action** is the **Dao of ruling the world**, and it is also the **elixir of Great Return** for refining oneself.\n\nIn a **Great Peace**, governance reaches its highest principle—regulations are light, the people transform naturally. Above, there is **non-action**, yet all is governed; below, there is **non-action**, yet all is transformed. All **ghostly omens and malevolent spirits** vanish without a trace—not that they are annihilated, but that they naturally dissolve into the **Dao of non-action**, their deceits and transformations having no place to manifest. Droughts, floods, plagues, and epidemics cannot arise.\n\nIn the human body, **ghosts** are the **yin**, still and unaware; **spirits** are the **yang**, dynamic and active. For those who cultivate greatly, the mind encompasses all things yet remains without mind, emotions respond to all things yet remain without emotion. **Yin** contains **yang**, **yang** contains **yin**—stillness without stillness, motion without motion. Motion and stillness interact; **yin** and **yang** mutually root each other.\n\nIt is not that there is no awareness in unawareness or action in non-action. Rather, within unawareness lies awareness; within non-action lies action.\n\nWhen it is said, *\"its spirits are not uncanny,\"* it is not that they are dull and lifeless. For the awareness within unawareness is the **true and equal awakening**; non-action in action is the natural unfolding of heaven’s will. How could it compare to the deceptive awareness of the overly conscious or the rigid adherence of the overly active, which would harm the **original elixir**?\n\nWhen it is said, *\"its spirit does not harm,\"* it is not that the **spirit does not harm**, but that the **Dao of non-action** preserves the innate **true nature** of life and the ceaseless **numinous qi** of existence—uninterrupted sincerity, encompassing all things without omission. Though there may be creation and destruction, there is no true loss or gain; though there may be fullness and emptiness, there is no true increase or decrease.\n\nThe so-called *\"unperturbed and unalarmed,\"* *\"without worry or concern\"*—this is it.\n\nAnd how could it harm others? It is not that the sage does not harm others, but rather that with the **vital force** of spontaneous vitality, he preserves the **original true nature**; with the **harmonizing trance** of the Three Mysteries, he nurtures the **free-flowing elixir**. At once, the **divine fire** refines, and the ghosts wail while the spirits cry out, the malevolent retreat in submission—**the True Person** emerges.\n\nThis is called *\"the two not harming each other,\"* who could say otherwise? Both in heaven and among men, all praise its **virtue**.\n\nAh! The interplay of darkness and light—**not the virtue of the spirit**, how could it reach such heights?\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One: The Great Must Descend**\n\nThe great state descends to flow beneath,\na gathering place for all under heaven,\nthe **receptive** of all under heaven.\n\nThe **receptive** always takes the **creative** through stillness,\nstillness as the foundation of descent.\nThus, when the great state descends beneath the small state,\nit takes the small state;\nwhen the small state descends beneath the great state,\nit takes the great state.\nHence, either it descends to take,\nor it descends while taking.\n\nThe great state seeks only to **harbor** all people,\nthe small state seeks only to **submit** and serve others.\nWhen both attain what they desire,\nthe great state is fitting to descend.\n\nThe **Supreme Sage** speaks of cultivating the Dao and refining the elixir—\nall must take **gentleness** as the principle,\nstillness as the essence.\n\nThough it may be said that *\"gentleness and passivity are useless,\"*\nand *\"solitude and seclusion are hard to accomplish,\"*\nyet at the outset of seated meditation,\none must first arise from stillness,\nrigidity from gentleness—\nonly then is the **true and equal Dao** revealed.\n\nThe analogy: *\"The great state descends to flow beneath,\"*\nspeaks of water having high and low—\nthe high water must flow downward before it ceases.\n\nIf the great state humbles itself and restrains its ambition,\nwith no thought of arrogance or deception,\nit will be admired by all under heaven—\nlike the low-lying land where all streams converge,\nits influence is inevitable.\n\nThus it is said: *\"The gathering place of all under heaven.\"*\n\nWhen all under heaven gather,\nit is because they can descend themselves.\nDescending, their **qi** is most **gentle**—\nnot the utmost **rigidity**.\n\nWhich among things is more **creative** than the **creative**?\nWhich is more **receptive** than the **receptive**?\n\nThe **creative** is yang, **rigidity**;\nthe **receptive** is yin, **gentleness**.\nThus, it is fitting that the **creative yang** should surpass the **receptive yin**—\nyet why does the **receptive** always overcome the **creative**?\n\nIt is because the **receptive** can attain stillness.\nThe ancients said: *\"Stillness governs movement,\"*\ntheir words are unerring—\njust as the low supports the high,\nits influence is inevitable.\n\nHow much more so for the great state,\nwhich descends to **nurture** itself,\nis **humble** to **protect** others,\nand yet all states come to **revere** and **submit**?\n\nThus, descending is the basis of **high** virtue,\nstillness the root of descent.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nsometimes the great state descends beneath the small state—\nlike **Tang the Victorious** descending to **Bo Ge**,\nultimately taking **Bo Ge’s** lands,\n**nurturing** and **possessing** them—\nthis is the case.\n\nOr the small state descends beneath the great state—\nlike **Gou Jian** submitting to the **King of Wu**,\nultimately taking **Wu’s** legacy,\n**harboring** and **possessing** it—\nthis is the case.\n\nOr the great state does not act great but acts small—\nthus it takes the small state as effortlessly as turning one’s palm.\n\nOr the small state remains content in its smallness and serves the great—\nthus it takes the great state as easily as picking up a blade of grass.\n\nDiscussing the **proud and mighty** great states,\nthey are truly the models for all states,\n**nurturing** and **calming** with method,\n**embracing** and **reconciling** with strategy—\nnot desiring to swallow all under heaven,\nto unify the land by force,\nbut rather to **harbor** the small states,\nto make all under heaven a single family—\nonly those with **great virtue** beyond others\ncan **rest** and **contain** with ease.\n\nThus, it is fitting that all under heaven should **return** to **Ren**,\nall directions **submit** to the **Mandate**.\n\nThe **petty and insignificant**,\nall equally part of the **feudal division**,\nas vassals offering tribute in fear and trembling—\nnot desiring to **exalt** themselves to **humble** others,\nnor to **preserve** their lineage by **prolonging** their rule,\nbut only to **submit** and **serve** to **fulfill** themselves,\nto **extend** the **respite** of the common people—\nonly those with **great wisdom** beyond others\ncan **restrain** themselves and descend with ease.\n\nThus, it is fitting that the people’s hearts **love** and **revere**,\nthe **Mandate** comes to **return**.\n\nMoreover, men must have **aspirations** and **desires**,\nthe great state desires to **harbor** all people,\nthe small state desires to **submit** and **serve**—\nboth desires, one of **Ren** and one of **wisdom**,\nhave already attained what they seek,\nwithout straying into the **private desires** of men—\nthis shows that great and small states,\nby **name**, follow their **principle**,\n**settle** in their **allotted roles**,\nand none dare **transgress** their duties.\n\nAlthough the small state descends,\nits principle is inevitable;\nthe great state, especially, must **dwell** in descent—\nonly then does the **True Person** begin to **stand erect**,\nbecoming the **reliance** for all under heaven.\n\nThus is the **Age of Peace**—\nhow different is the **cultivation** of the body?\n\n*\"The great state\"* is an analogy for the **original spirit**,\n*\"descending flow\"* for the **divine light** descending to illuminate the **elixir field**,\nwhile the **yin essence** also descends into the **elixir field**,\nthe **divine fire** refines—\nthe essence transforms into **qi**, which then generates **spirit**.\n\nThis **elixir field** is the **original pass**.\n\nThe **elixir field** is the **total support** of the body,\nthe **convergence** of the five **qi**,\nthe **condensation** of the three **blossoms**—\nwhere the elixir forms and the **spirit** gestates,\nwhere the **spirit** emerges and the **sage** is born—\nall refining occurs within this single **pass**.\n\nThus it is said: *\"The gathering place of all under heaven,\"*\nlike all rivers converging at the sea—\nhere is where the elixir is refined.\n\nAnd the method of **combining medicines**,\nagain values **gentleness** and **flexibility** as the core—\nthus it takes its symbol from the **receptive** of all under heaven.\n\nThe **receptive** is **gentleness**, **harmony**—\nthe **Supreme Sage’s** **Dao**, also called *\"concentrating qi to achieve gentleness.\"*\n\nIn such **utter gentleness** and **harmony**,\nthe **original essence** flows freely,\ntransforming into **qi** to generate **spirit**.\n\nMoreover, the **original essence** resides within—\nstillness **cultivates** the **kidney qi**,\nuntil the **divine fire** refines,\nthe essence transforms into **qi**,\nand then the **reverse cultivation** technique is applied—\n**ascending** and **swallowing** it,\nreturning it to the **earthly crucible** to **lead refine mercury**,\nthus **using the creative to govern the receptive**—\nthis is the **River Vehicle** and beyond.\n\nIf at the **beginning of cultivation**,\nthe heart is **externally yang** and **internally yin**,\nthe **kidneys** are **externally yin** and **internally yang**.\n\n「Speaking of the post-heavenly form,\nthe heart’s external yang is the *male* (社),\nthe kidneys’ external yin is the *female* (牝).\n\nNow, when the *emptiness of the Receptive* (离中虚) becomes yin,\nand the *fullness of the Abysmal* (坎中满) becomes yang,\nit is as the *Awakening to Truth* says:\n*“Though others may be the host, I am the guest”*;\nand again:\n*“Though yang is the male body of a woman,\nyin, though the female body, is the male essence.”*\nThis is the inversion of Heaven and Earth—\nthe Receptive reversed becomes the *male*,\nthe Abysmal reversed becomes the *female*.\n\nThe method of cultivation seeks to\ntransform the heart’s rigidity into gentleness,\nits agitation into stillness;\nto transmute the kidneys’ softness into firmness,\nits stillness into motion.\n\nThus, the Receptive’s gentle harmony\nnourishes the Abysmal’s fierce yang—\nthis is *“fire within birthing wooden fluid,\nwater within forging adamantine steel.”*\nBy the heart directing the *qi*,\nand by nature tempering the passions—\nwhen emotions do not move recklessly,\nit is only through silence and gentleness,\nhumility and yielding below.\n\nThis refines the heart’s nature.\nHence, the *upper field’s* sweet nectar\nflows into the *primordial sea*;\nthe fluid then transforms into *qi* and enters the *elixir field*.\n\n*“The great realm yields to the small realm”*\nrefers to the descent from the upper field to the lower.\n*“Taking the small realm”* means extracting the *golden water qi* from the elixir field,\nreversing it through the *River Vehicle*,\nand ascending to the *celestial pass*—this is so.\n*“The small realm yields to the great realm”*\nis again descending from the lower field to *Kunlun*—this is so.\n\nTo take the *great realm* is to merge Kunlun’s golden fluid,\nreturning it to the *Yellow Court*.\nI take the upper field’s sweet, pure nectar,\nflowing it into the lower elixir field to generate *qi*—\nthen to extract the elixir field’s *qi* is to take from the great realm below.\nOr, the elixir field’s *qi* ascends in reverse to the celestial pass to generate fluid—\nswallowing the celestial pass’s *qi* is to take from the small realm below.\n\nThis is the golden water ascending,\nthe lead-qi merging with marrow,\nthe essence condensing, the *qi* harmonized—\nin an instant, transforming into sweet dew, divine water,\nflowing to the upper palate,\ndrop by drop returning to its source—\nthis is the moment when fluid transforms into *qi*.\n\nWhen the *qi* mechanism is robust,\nagain operate the *River Vehicle*,\nsending it upward to Kunlun,\nswallowing the brain’s sea marrow and essence,\nthen descending back to the Yellow Court—\nthis is when *qi* transforms into fluid.\n\nYet, *“the great realm is the downward flow”*—\nwith gentleness and stillness,\nresting with boundless capacity,\ntruly surpassing others in measure—\nthis is when spirit transforms *qi* and *qi* refines essence,\nfilling the elixir field.\n\nThus, the *desire to nurture others’ virtue*\npossesses the small realm’s inner clarity,\nknowing its strength cannot rival,\nwillingly submitting to serve—\ntruly surpassing others in magnanimity.\nThis is when essence generates *qi*, *qi* generates spirit,\nalso returning to depend on the Yellow Court.\n\nThus, the *way of serving others*.\nBoth desires are without external longing—\nso the elixir completes its nine transformations,\nthe Dao ascends to the ninth heaven,\neternally enduring alongside Heaven and Earth.\nWhat then is the exchange of its virtue?\n\nThe subtle key to cultivating the self\nfinds no equal to this.\nThose who attain it treasure it—\ndo not lightly divulge it.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao is Most Precious to the World**\n\nThe Dao is the mystery of all things,\nthe treasure of the virtuous,\nthe safeguard of the unvirtuous.\nFine words can be traded,\nnoble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\nWhat is there to discard in a person’s unvirtue?\nThus, though one may have a wall to block swift horses,\nit is not as good as advancing this Dao.\n\nWhy was this Dao held most precious in antiquity?\nWas it not to seek and obtain,\nto avoid guilt and escape punishment?\nThus, it is most precious to the world.\n\nThe Great Dao arises before Heaven and Earth,\nmingles within the void and formlessness,\ndim and indistinct—\nvisible yet unseen, heard yet unheard, grasped yet untouched—\nyet truly that upon which all things depend for life.\n\nZisi said:\n*“The way of the noble is costly and hidden.”*\nWithout the Dao, there is no thing;\nwithout things, there is no Dao.\nThe Great Cycle’s boundaries,\nrefined into the finest dust—\nit cannot be sought through traces or symbols,\ncannot be exhausted by speech.\nTruly, it contains the utmost void yet embraces the utmost reality,\nthe utmost emptiness yet encompasses the utmost substance—\nvast and boundless, profound and unfathomable.\nNo mystery surpasses this.\n\nThe virtuous know this Dao is the most vital to the human body,\nso they cherish and conceal it,\ncultivate and treasure it,\nnever willing to part from it even for a breath.\nThe unvirtuous also know that with the Dao,\nlife may be preserved and fortune attained,\nbut without it,\nlife is hard to prolong and calamity abounds.\nNo better strategy exists for preserving the body.\n\nMoreover, if this Dao of *the Middle Way* is expressed in speech,\nit becomes *fine words*—\nlike precious goods sold in the marketplace,\nwhich all love and covet,\ndesiring to possess.\nIf this ordinary Dao is manifested in conduct,\nit becomes *noble action*—\nlike the stature of a great lord,\nwhich all respect and honor,\neach elevating it above themselves.\n\nIf it cannot be spoken of,\nits market reverses into disgrace;\nif it cannot be practiced,\nits bestowal invites slander.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*“Heaven nurtures the people,\nestablishing things with their proper norms.\nThe people’s inherent nature\nloves this virtuous power.”*\nThis shows that though good and evil differ,\ntheir love of virtue is one.\n\nSeeing the virtuous, I should revere them.\nEven seeing the unvirtuous—\nhow can I hate them?\nIt is only that their *qi* and nature are occasionally skewed,\ntheir desires not yet refined,\nand thus they stray from the Dao.\nYet their source is ultimately unchanging.\n\nIf one can transform and guide them,\neven the most wicked may turn toward goodness.\nGreat indeed is Heaven and Earth’s rejection of nothing,\nthe Sage’s rejection of no one.\n\nIf there are those rejected,\nit is self-rejection—\nhow could the Daoist endure to cast them out?\nHeaven creates the people and establishes rulers over them,\nmaking them teachers,\nso that they may govern the world and set the Three Ministers—\nall to统驭 the common folk,\nto transform and guide the masses.\nCorrecting oneself to correct the court,\ncorrecting the court to correct the world.\n\n「Let the myriad lands harmonize in unity,\nand may the winds of the four quarters stir in accord,\nso that the Son of Heaven may long preserve his august dignity,\nand the Three Ministers may long enjoy their noble rank—\nonly then shall he rest.\n\nIf one cannot uphold the Dao as Heaven’s way,\nto renew and sustain the people,\nhow could one ever permanently secure Heaven’s mandate,\nand enjoy boundless blessings?\n\nEven with the splendor of arched walls before him,\nand fine carriages drawn by four steeds behind,\nhe cannot find a moment’s ease.\n\nHow much better to approach the Dao daily,\never vigilant at dawn and diligent at dusk,\nnever forgetting, but sitting in its embrace!\n\nThe *Chu Book* says:\n*\"The treasure of Chu is none other than goodness—\ngoodness alone is the treasure.\"*\n\nThe *Shang Book* says:\n*\"Treasure only the virtuous,\nand the common folk shall be at peace.\"*\n\nThis is the Dao—\nthe most prized by ancient emperors, kings, ministers, and officials alike.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?\nBecause the Dao is the inherent path of all people,\none who seeks it shall find it,\nand its pursuit is swift and effortless.\n\nIf one upholds this Dao,\nhe becomes a true man of worth;\nif one defies and betrays it,\nhe becomes a great offender against Heaven and Earth.\n\nIs it merely that he has faults\nand cannot avoid straying into error?\nZisi’s son said:\n*\"The Dao must never be abandoned for an instant.\"*\n\nLet men strive earnestly!\nFor the Dao is a great matter in life—\nwhether Son of Heaven or Three Ministers,\nall should cherish and hold it dear.\n\nEven with arched walls and four-horse carriages,\nthey are not as beneficial as mastering the Dao.\nDo not say, *\"I am too aged,\nmy qi too diminished,\"*\nand thus excuse oneself—\nthis is not acceptable.\n\nThough gold elixir and jade elixir\nmay require the refinement of post-heaven *qi*, essence, and spirit\nto attain immortality and sainthood,\nthey are not the core of our teaching.\n\nThe ancients spoke of *\"Great Harmony as the Dao,\"*\nand again of *\"Emptiness-Nothingness as the Dao.\"*\nThus, if one does not grasp the principle of Emptiness-Nothingness,\nor the Dao of Great Harmony,\neven if he refines essence and subdues *qi*,\nenters the realm of non-duality (*feifei*),\nstill he will differ not from the common man.\n\nTherefore, in our Daoist practice of elixir cultivation,\none must take the Primordial Spirit (*yuánshén*) as the master,\nand the Primordial *Qi* (*yuánqì*) as the assistant to the spirit,\nusing true breathing as the means to forge the elixir.\n\nWithout the Primordial Spirit,\nthere is no foundation for the elixir;\nwithout the Primordial *Qi*,\nthere is no aid to refine it.\n\nThis is like a fetus having a child within it—\nwithout the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood,\nit remains empty and unformed.\n\nOnce the Primordial Spirit and *Qi* are obtained,\nwithout true fetal breathing (*táixī*),\nthe spirit and *qi* cannot coalesce in one place,\nmerge as a single whole,\nand return to the original state of Great Purity (*táisù*).\n\nI impart this further truth:\nWhen a person practices cultivation,\nhaving obtained the Primordial Spirit and *Qi*,\nand possessing true breath to regulate,\nhe must gather the five into four,\nand merge the three into one.\nYet without true intention as the guiding commander,\nthe energies shall scatter and disperse,\nnever spontaneously uniting to form the elixir.\n\nBut whence does true intention arise?\nIt must come from the state of utmost Emptiness and profound stillness,\nwhen there is no knowing and no awareness—\nsuddenly, the *qi*-mechanism is touched,\nand awareness begins.\nThis is the true intention,\nnot the same as ordinary mind or ordinary intention.\n\nThus the ancients said,\n*\"Sainthood is not attained by others—\nonly by this one who cultivates without attachment.\"*\n\nYet without the gold within water,\nand the *qi* within essence,\nas aids to support it,\neven the Primordial nature remains suspended and ungrounded,\nand may fall into dull, inert voidness.\n\nOnce knowing the birth of the elixir,\nwithout true breath to regulate and refine,\nhow could one gather and cook it into the elixir?\n\nThus, true breath is the essential tool for elixir cultivation,\nand true intention is the sovereign ruler of true breath.\n\nFor those who have not yet attained unity of spirit and *qi*,\nhow can they achieve stillness and concentration?\n\nOnce spirit and *qi* are returned to their command,\nthey must be deeply fermented—\nonly then shall the elixir be fully realized.\n\nDo not dare to arouse the bright, aware mind,\nfor this shall only cause separation between wood and metal,\nand block the interaction of *kàn* and *lí* (water and fire).\n\nI use this to illuminate the mysteries of the Dao—\nlater scholars who grasp its meaning,\nlet them cherish and guard it carefully!\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three: The Great as the Non-Great**\nTo act in greatness is to act in non-action (*wúwéi*),\nto do in doing is to do in non-doing (*shìwúshì*),\nto taste in tastelessness is to taste the Dao.\n\nGreat and small, much and little—\nto repay resentment with virtue.\n\nTo attempt the difficult in its ease,\nto achieve the great in its minute.\n\nThe most difficult things under Heaven\nmust be begun in simplicity;\nthe greatest affairs under Heaven\nmust be rooted in the smallest details.\n\nTherefore, the Sage never acts in greatness,\nand thus can accomplish the great.\n\nHe who makes light of his promises\nshall be found lacking in trustworthiness;\nhe who seeks much shall encounter many difficulties.\n\nThus the Sage treats difficulty as difficulty,\nand so shall he never face true difficulty.\n\nThe Dao is inherently the Middle Way (*zhōngyōng*),\none that all may learn,\nand each may attain.\n\nYet because of the obstruction of things\nand the constriction of *qi*,\nif one does not forcefully cut away these hindrances,\nhow can he penetrate and see the original face of reality?\n\nLike washing clothes—\nlong stained by dust and filth,\none cannot remove it in a single step.\nIt must be gradually scrubbed,\ndelicately plucked,\nonly then can the ragged cloth be made whole and new.\n\nIf one uses too much force,\nnot only shall the filth not be removed,\nbut the garment itself may be torn.\n\nThus the practitioner who seeks to penetrate the fundamental truth,\nhow can he fail to proceed step by step?\n\nAt first, he must strive and discipline himself,\nwithout reckless haste;\nwith time, he grows natural in the Middle Way,\nand sees the original nature of Heaven.\n\nWhen his work reaches the stage of refining Emptiness and uniting with the Dao,\nhe acts in non-action;\nwhen he responds to the Dao in its natural way,\nhe does without doing.\n\nPlain and unremarkable,\nwhat taste can there be?\nWithout taste,\nwhat can there be to weary of?\n\nAs for the great going to the small,\nthe waning yielding to the waxing,\nuntil the point of retribution—\nthis is not done with resentment,\nbut with virtue.\nAll these are the utmost transformations,\nthe complete fulfillment of cause and effect.\n\nYet in applying this,\nhe is even-handed without bias;\nin repaying resentment with virtue,\nthere is no strange sentiment.\n\nMoreover, virtue is the shared goodness of all people,\nto repay with virtue is to act with the natural,\npure, and untainted spirit of man.»\n\nConforming to the Way of things, governing people with humanity,\neven in matters of greatness and smallness, excess and deficiency,\nall align with the movement of Heaven—\neach moment is the Dao,\neverywhere without deviation,\nyet never conflicting with oneself,\nnor offending others.\n\nAlas, this Dao is both supremely difficult and supremely easy,\nboth supremely vast and supremely minute.\n\nYet worldly cultivators, seeking swift results and immediate effects,\noften pursue what is difficult,\ndelight in what is grand,\nunaware that difficulty lies in ease,\nand that the foundation of the great lies in the small.\nThus, all great undertakings in the world must begin with the minute.\n\nHow much more so the Dao, the root of all things and affairs?\nCan it not be approached by first mastering ease before difficulty,\nand smallness before greatness?\n\nOtherwise, those who advance too swiftly will retreat just as quickly—\nhow then could they hope to attain the realm of divine transformation?\n\nTherefore, the sages of old knew that the Dao has stages to ascend,\nthat learning has a path to progress.\nThey did not contemplate distant grandeur,\nbut focused solely on the immediate essence,\nrefining dross, nurturing the source—\nlike water seeping into grass and wood,\nnaturally changing day by day, month by month,\ngrowing without visible growth.\n\nThus, from the subtle beginnings,\nfrom the crude to the refined,\nfrom action and affairs to non-action and non-doing—\nthe more insipid, the richer;\nthe nearer, the farther—\nuntil the attainment of sublime greatness.\n\nThe sage never seeks the great directly,\nand thus achieves it.\n\nToday’s scholars, at their very outset,\nalready aspire to become immortals.\nThe greater their ambition, the harder the task,\nand most falter halfway through.\n\nOnly by persevering with steadfast endurance,\nby maintaining an unyielding, ceaseless resolve,\ncan the difficult become easy,\nand the great be grasped through the small.\n\nI urge scholars to seek difficulty in ease,\nto achieve greatness through the minute,\nto proceed with measured patience and maturity,\nlest they rush to recklessness and superficiality.\n\nOtherwise, not only will they fail to grasp the Dao’s profundity\nby cultivating a heart of sincerity and depth from the start,\nbut even in their most trivial promises,\nthose who act lightly will lack trustworthiness,\nand their regrets will only deepen.\nThose who seek ease will often encounter difficulty,\nand retreat will follow swiftly—\nthis is inevitable.\n\nThus, the sage’s cultivation begins with ease and smallness as its foundation,\nyet remains ever diligent and cautious—\nthis resolve never wanes.\nBy first addressing what is difficult,\nlater progress becomes as smooth as pushing a boat downstream,\nacting without effort—\nthus it is said, *\"In the end, there is no difficulty.\"*\n\nThese three phrases—*\"For non-action\"*\n—are the pure work of spontaneous alignment.\n\nWhat follows—*\"Seeking difficulty in ease\"*\n—expresses the intent that profound mastery must begin with the shallow and near.\n\nAs for the Alchemical Way,\nspeaking of lead and mercury—\nwhat are these things?\nLet it be clarified:\nThis matter concerns only the two poles of yin and yang.\n\nWhen mercury is paired with lead,\nit is as the female paired with the male.\nAfter their union, primordial *qi* is generated,\nthen this *qi* is merged with yin *qi* in the central palace,\nand thus the elixir is formed.\n\nIn the primordial state, *Li* (離) is the pure yang of *Qian* (乾),\nand *Kan* (坎) is the pure yin of *Kun* (坤).\nWhen the *qi* mechanism moves,\nthe central *yao* of *Qian* enters *Kun*,\nand the central *yao* of *Kun* enters *Qian*’s cavity—\n*Qian* thus becomes empty and turns into *Li*,\nwhile *Kun* becomes solid and turns into *Kan*.\nHence, though *Qian* is yang, it contains yin,\nand though *Kun* is yin, it contains yang—\nyet it is not the original pure yin, pure yang, or the undifferentiated *Tai Ji*.\n\nStill, it remains authentic.\nWith time, the spirit generates essence,\nand *qi* transforms into blood,\ngiving rise to the nature of substance and *qi*,\nand the fate of life’s measure.\n\nSince there is a mind with thought and awareness,\nand a body of *qi*, blood, and form,\nit differs from the original *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nThe adept, through methodical cultivation,\ndraws the single point of *yi* mercury from *Li*’s center—\n(mercury is heart fluid;\nthough fluid belongs to yin,\nit arises from *Li* fire and carries its nature)—\nand descends it into *Kan*’s palace,\ninfusing *Kan*’s single point of yin blood—\n(blood is *Kan* water;\nthough water belongs to yang,\nit emerges from *Kan* water and is essentially cold)—\nas the ancients said:\n*\"Fire enters the water domain,\"*\n*\"Spirit enters the *qi* realm.\"*\nLike ice encountering fire,\nor charcoal heating a pot,\nit naturally warms, generating a pulsating *qi* of yin vitality.\n\nThough fire enters water,\nit is like adding charcoal beneath a pot—\nthe rising heat steams upward in vigor,\nand true lead is born.\n\nGuided by the spirit, it ascends to the *niwan* (cinnabar field)—\njust as alcohol vapors rise in a heated still,\ncondensing into dew that drips into the jar—\n(which is what our teaching calls *\"true mercury,\"*\nor *\"Hurry, pour the North Sea’s first tidewater\nto nourish the old tree’s roots\"*).\nIn truth, *qi* has transformed into fluid.\n\nReturning to the furnace for warmth and nourishment,\nthe fluid again becomes *qi*,\ncycling endlessly in ascent and descent,\nuntil the body of *qi* and blood is exhausted,\nyin *qi* is stripped away,\nand the mortal form is transmuted into a golden body,\nthe turbid transformed into the pure,\nrestoring the original *Tai Ji*—\nthe law-body of non-arising and non-perishing.\n\nThe late Zhu Yuan Yu once said:\n*\"When speaking of *Kan* and *Li*,\nthe essence of *Li* and the *qi* of *Kan* within the body\nare both vulgar lead.\nOnly when *Kan* and *Li* unite,\nand true yin and true yang converge,\ndoes a single point of true yang emerge—\nthis is the seed of primordial true lead.\nYet without a master’s oral instructions,\neven if one forcibly restrains it,\none can only preserve the color of the body.\nWhen the lower *dan*tian is full and strong,\nit will inevitably collapse over time.\nThe student who attains this yang birth\nhas only completed half the work—\nhow could they hope to gestate and become a sage?\n\nOnly by drawing this yang *qi* upward,\nmerging it with the body’s yin essence,\nand further combining it with the spirit marrow and essence fluid of the *niwan* and *jiangong* (vermilion palace)—\nthis is truly *\"The eastern household’s daughter (wood mercury),\nthe western neighbor’s son (gold lead),\nuniting as husband and wife in the nuptial chamber.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Mother urges drinking *tíhú* wine,\neach day perfuming and steeping in intoxication’s embrace.\n\nThis is the union of *Yīn* and *Yáng* to forge the *Dān*—\nwhat came before was merely *Kǎn* and *Lí* merging to yield the medicine.\n\nWith this true *qián* (true lead) and true *gǒng* (true mercury) united,\nonly then can one refine the *huándān* (returned elixir).\nFor *qián* is the gold born from water,\nand *gǒng* is the wood born from fire.\nWhat came before was but common lead and common mercury—\nnow, this is the true *qián* and true *gǒng*.\n\nIf the student follows this path,\ncultivating the *shén* (spirit) without agitating the *qì* (breath),\nthen perhaps they will not err in their endeavor.\n\n**Chapter 64: Effortless and Non-grasping**\n*Wúwéi wúzhí* (effortless and non-grasping) is fundamental and easy to uphold,\nits unmanifested state easy to plan for,\nits fragile nature easy to shatter,\nits subtle essence easy to disperse.\nAct before it arises,\nrectify before it becomes disordered.\n\nA tree of embrace—begins from a hair’s end;\na nine-tiered terrace—begins from piled earth;\na thousand-*lǐ* journey—begins beneath one’s feet.\nThose who act bring ruin,\nthose who grasp lose hold.\nThus, the sage acts without effort,\nand so knows no ruin;\ngrasps nothing,\nand so loses nothing.\nThe people’s undertakings\noften falter just as completion nears.\nTo be cautious at the end as at the beginning—\nthen there will be no ruinous affairs.\n\nThus, the sage desires without desiring,\ndoes not prize hard-to-obtain treasures;\nlearns without learning,\nreverses the errors of others.\nTo aid all things in their natural unfolding,\nwithout daring to interfere.\nThe *Dao* of cultivating the self\nbegins with restraining desire.\nThe key to restraining desire:\nto rectify it before it manifests is easy,\nto rectify it as it begins to manifest is difficult;\nto rectify it when it is manifesting is still more difficult,\nto rectify it after it has manifested is hardest.\n\nHence, the *Tàishàng* (Supreme Sage) says:\n*“Its settled state is easy to uphold,\nits unmanifested state is easy to plan for.”*\nWhen one resides in quiet solitude,\nthe mind not enslaved by affairs,\naffairs not disturbing the mind,\nstill and unmoving,\nsettled in its place—\nthen upholding oneself and guarding the body\nis most effortless.\n\nMoreover, in silence and obscurity,\nwithout knowing or awareness,\nno trace or sign to seek—\nhere, to devise plans and ponder,\nto banish idle thoughts and preserve sincerity,\nits momentum is most natural,\nits opportunity most ripe.\nFor common *qì* is soft and fragile,\ncommon mind is subtle and fleeting—\nnot yet entangled without end,\nnot yet turning ceaselessly—\nhere, to break through perverse thoughts,\nto scatter the seeds of desire,\nand restore the natural *Dao* of Heaven,\nthe sincerity of the uncontrived—\nhow difficult could it be to sever the bonds of karma\nand instantly reveal the original nature of the self?\n\nThis is not some separate act of effort—\nit is merely *“acting before it arises.”*\n\n「The ancient sage sought to prevent calamity before its sprouting,\nto scrutinize the signs when movement was imminent—\nthus sweeping away all smoke and clouds,\nleaving no thorns or brambles to grow.\n\nAgain, when the world was at peace,\neven if a tyrant or minor rogue\nseized the moment to cause disorder,\nit was no difficulty for a lone horseman to emerge,\nsee instant surrender,\nand quell the disturbance before it took root—\nits ease was indeed so great.\n\nThis discipline of self-refinement is still relatively attainable;\nbut if one seeks to perfect the **Nine Transformations**,\nit cannot be measured by years and months.\n\nHow many are the ordinary, mundane folk\nwho do not know that the **Dao/Way** is the great path of Heaven and Earth,\nand that humanity is the true person of the cosmos!\nSome may chance upon a **dharma** assembly\nand attain fulfillment in a single lifetime;\nsome may miss the right **karmic conditions**\nand require several lifetimes before completion;\nsome may undergo repeated cultivation and many trials,\nencountering fortunate circumstances,\nyet fail to perfect their **virtue/power**—\ntheir nature perverse, their disposition flawed—\nthey nearly succeed, then fail,\nand in failing, never attain.\n\nTruly profound are the mysteries of the **Great Dao/Way**,\nnot easily fathomed!\n\nIf one does not know the **Dao/Way** has its own means of realization,\nlet them observe how things come to fruition:\nA tree with arms to embrace—\nits origin was but a tiny sprout—\nthrough the nurturing warmth of yin and yang,\nchanging daily and monthly,\ngrows into a great tree.\n\nA nine-tiered tower—\nits foundation was merely piled earth—\nthrough human labor and diligent gathering,\never renewing and flourishing day by day,\nsuddenly becomes a towering edifice.\n\nOr, as with a unified realm of rivers and mountains,\na thousand *li* of territory to traverse—\ncould one expect to reach it with a single step,\nor measure the journey by days?\nIts beginning is but one step at a time,\nfrom near to far,\nuntil at last one arrives.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is called great,\nfor it truly encompasses the vastness of Heaven and Earth,\nthe capacity to nurture all beings—\nhow could it not require layered effort to attain,\nor winding progress to unfold?\n\nOnly those who deeply grasp the **Dao/Way**\ndo not seek swift results,\ndo not measure progress by near gains—\nthough gold and jade may be polished,\ntheir resolve remains unpolished;\nthough seasons change,\ntheir diligence does not wane—\nthus, they grow from small to great,\nfrom low to high,\nfrom near to far,\njust as the tree with arms to embrace,\nthe nine-tiered tower,\nor the thousand-*li* journey—\nand suddenly reveal wonders beyond compare.\n\nYet, the **Dao/Way** is the **natural Dao/Way**,\nand its attainment requires **natural virtue/power**—\nMencius spoke of **\"gathering and nurturing\"** (*jìyì shēngqì*) **[1]**\nto achieve effortless fulfillment, unceasing renewal.\n\nAt first, it aligns with the **Heaven-Earth transformations**,\nyet its radiance remains ever the same as the sun and moon.\nIf one acts with contrivance,\nthe act will fail;\nif one grasps with attachment,\nthe grasper will lose.\n\nHeaven and Earth, the sun and moon—\neternally turning without cessation—\ndo they not achieve their transformations without effort?\nIf Heaven and Earth labored to cycle endlessly,\nor the sun and moon clung to movement,\nhow could they endure for ten thousand ages?\n\nThe saying goes:\n*\"If Heaven had emotions, Heaven would grow old;\nthe sun moves without intent, yet its light remains constant.\"*\nIs this not the truth?\n\nThus, the ancient sages\nrefined the **Dao/Way** with utmost precision,\nharmonizing perfectly with nature’s flow.\nThey acted without contrivance—\ntheir **virtue/power** never failed;\nthey grasped without attachment—\nwhat loss of **virtue/power** could there be?\n\nYet today’s practitioners of the **Dao/Way**\nmistake **non-action** (*wúwéi*) for mere inaction,\nsometimes acting, sometimes abandoning—\nthey do not know when to move or when to rest,\nwhen to align with the natural rhythms,\nor when to stray far from them.\nSome nearly perfect their attainment,\nthen suddenly falter,\nand in faltering, never complete it at all.\n\nThe *Classic of Documents* says:\n*\"Be cautious of its end,\nfor it begins with the first steps.\"*\nThus, it endures through countless ages without decay.\n\nAs for rare treasures,\nwhich people value highly—\nthe sage blends with the common, his light unassuming,\nno different from others,\nyet he seeks the **Dao/Way** and not wealth.\nAt first, he does not even know\nthat the world holds such treasures as precious,\nso he does not prize them—\nhis detachment and clarity of purpose are thus.\n\nOtherwise, in matters of sight, hearing, speech, and action,\nin daily customs and conduct,\nthose who abandon moral restraint and indulge in licentiousness\nneed not be spoken of—\neven among those who pursue the **Dao/Way**,\nwhether they cling to emptiness or solidity,\nto attachment or non-attachment,\nall are errors.\n\nNow, I alone follow the methods of the ancients,\nembrace the **Dao/Way** of old,\nand express my own views—\nnot to claim they surpass all others,\nbut to weigh the **Great Dao/Way** as a standard.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is my own **Dao/Way**,\nlearning is my own learning—\nI find it through myself,\nand it is self-attained—\nwhat need is there for further study?\n\nMoreover, people often err in their actions,\nwhile I alone act without contrivance.\nWith my **Dao/Way** of non-action,\nI correct the excesses of others—\nthis is to rectify myself in order to rectify others.\nAnd with my **Dao/Way** of non-action,\nI assist all things that fall short—\nthis is to regulate my own conduct\nand lead all beings by example—\nmy reverence for such rectitude is thus.\n\nThe sage’s person is the **Dao/Way**’s dwelling,\nthe foundation on which all beings depend—\nhow could he pause even for a breath?\n\nAt the outset, when I spoke of\n*\"its ease in upholding and guarding\"* and the following lines,\nI referred to the **Mystic Pass** (*Xuānguān*) **[2]**\n—a single aperture where,\nin perfect stillness, one is moved by sensation alone.\n\nEven in moments of **non-perception** (*bùdǔ*) and **non-hearing** (*bùwén*),\nhere lies the true essence of neither good nor evil.\nThe Buddha called it **\"that\"** (*nāgarā*),\nthe Confucian said **\"gathering and nurturing\"** (*jìxī*).\nBoth speak of this same reality.»\n\n---\n**[1]** *Jìyì shēngqì* (集義生氣): A phrase from Mencius, often translated as \"gathering virtue to generate the vital force\" or \"accumulating righteousness to invigorate moral energy.\"\n**[2]** *Xuānguān* (玄關): A term in Daoist and Buddhist meditation referring to the \"mystic gate\" or \"gate of the profound,\" a metaphor for the gateway to enlightenment or spiritual realization.\n\n「Like the morning sun upon lotus and willow,\nthe tender crimson and fresh green in dawn’s breeze—\nso delicate and lovely in their bloom.\n\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth in their primal union,\nall things refined in their pure transformation.\nMale and female in their union of essence,\nall things born in their natural generation.\"*\n**[3]**\n\nThis speaks only of the **initial qi** (*chūqì*) **[4]**\nsoft as dawn, still close to Heaven’s Way.\nZhūzǐ’s verse declares:\n*\"A half-acre pond opens like a mirror,\nwhere Heaven’s light and clouds’ shadows drift and linger.\"*\n**[5]**\n\nHere, the **Dao-heart** (*dàoxīn*) **[6]**\nand **human heart** (*rénxīn*) **[7]**\nare clearly distinct at a glance.\n\nTo **hold fast to this resolve** (*chízhì*) **[8]**\nand **nurture the qi** (*yǎngqì*), **[9]**\nto **establish the teaching** (*lìjiào*) **[10]**\nand **sever entanglements** (*gēduàn qiānhán*), **[11]**\nto **ascend the other shore** (*dàn dēng bǐ’àn*) **[12]**\n—all this is possible.\n\nThe *Lǐ* says:\n*\"Humans are born in stillness,\nthis is Heaven’s nature.\"*\n**[13]**\nYet when stirred by things,\nthis is the nature of desire.\n\nLike Heaven and Earth at the **primordial unity** (*yīyuán chūfù*), **[14]**\nall phenomena returning to spring’s renewal.\nThough things interact and desires stir,\nthey are still matters of Heaven’s nature,\nrooted in **emptiness and stillness** (*xūjìng*), **[15]**\nand aligned with the natural Way.\n\nOne need only **gently restrain** (*qiěqiě bǎchí*) **[16]**\nwithout great effort of wisdom or strategy—\nthen **desire can be checked** (*èyù*) **[17]**\nand **sincerity preserved** (*cúnchéng*), **[18]**\nwhile **evil inclinations are repelled** (*xiányé*) **[19]**\nand **rightness restored** (*guīzhèng*). **[20]\n\nFor the **sprouts** (*méngniè*) **[21]**\nare still tender and weak,\nand **human desire** (*rényù*) **[22]**\nis easily cut off—\nthen **Heaven’s principle** (*tiānlǐ*) **[23]**\ncan return as it was.\n\nThe ancients called this the **Mystic Pass** (*Xuānguān*) **[2]**\nor the **\"Gate of Life, Door of Death\"** (*Shēngmén Sǐhù*). **[24]\nWhen the **human heart retreats and hides** (*rénxīn tuìcáng*) **[25]**\nand **Heaven’s heart shines forth** (*tiānxīn zhàoyào*), **[26]**\nit is because, in the time of **non-being and non-chaos** (*wèiyǒu wèiluàn*), **[27]**\none **acts upon and governs** (*wéiyú zhìyú*) **[28]**\nthem.\n\nYet when the **first Yang stirs** (*yīyáng chūdòng*), **[29]**\nits mechanism is subtle,\nits force swift.\n\nBy the **second and third Yang**, **[30]**\nthe **spirit condenses** (*shén níng*) **[31]**\nand the **qi gathers** (*qì jù*), **[32]**\nthe **true essence moves** (*zhēnjīng zìdòng*) **[33]**\n—vast as the tide’s rise,\nflowing like ice melting into water.\n\nAll these changes\nbegin from the **Mystic Pass** (*Xuānguān*) **[2]**\nand grow from the **subtle to the manifest** (*zìwēi érzháo*), **[34]**\nfrom the **small to the great** (*yúxiǎo érdà*), **[35]**\nfrom the **near to the distant** (*zìjìn éryuǎn*). **[36]\n\nTo **advance the fire and talismans** (*jìn huǒ jìn fú*), **[37]**\nto **transport the River Chariot** (*héchē bānyùn*), **[38]**\nto **regenerate Yang Lead** (*yángqiān zàishēng*) **[39]**\nand **reunite Yin Mercury** (*yīnggǒng fùhé*), **[40]**\nto **cook and refine** (*shí pēng shí liàn*) **[41]**\ngradually, until the **spirit is complete** (*shén wán*) **[31]**\nand the **qi is robust** (*qì zhuàng*), **[9]**\nwhen the **elixir is ripe** (*yào shú*) **[42]**\nand the **Dan is perfected** (*dān yuán*), **[43]**\nand even the **six senses tremble** (*liùgēn zhèndòng*) **[44]**\nwhile the **six powers are fully realized** (*liùtōng jùzú*), **[45]**\n—all this stems from the **Mystic Pass** (*Xuānguān*) **[2]**\nonce it begins to move.\n\nAt this **initial stirring** (*chūdòng*), **[46]**\nthe **source is purest** (*shuǐyuán zhìqīng*).\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The white tiger’s first experience is the greatest treasure,\nthe divine pool’s water is true gold.\"*\n**[47]\n\nIf one **awakens to this** (*yījué*) **[48]**\nand **restrains it firmly** (*bǎchí dédìng*), **[49]**\nthen daily, one **refines one’s own Mercury** (*bāngù yǐjīng*), **[50]**\n**encloses and guards the Yin essence** (*bāogù yīnjīng*), **[51]**\njust as the **new crescent moon** (*xīnyuè*) **[52]**\nfirst appears as a faint trace,\nthen grows to half its wheel by the **upper arc** (*shàngxián*), **[53]**\nand finally fills to fullness at the **fifteenth day** (*shíwǔ yíngmǎn*). **[54]\n\nThus, the sage understands\nthat all under Heaven’s affairs and things\nrise from the **low to the high** (*yúbēi zhìgāo*), **[55]**\nfrom the **near to the distant** (*yújìn zhìyuǎn*), **[56]**\nall following the **natural Way** (*zìrán zhīdào*) **[57]**\nwithin them.\n\nSo, the sage **acts without acting** (*wéiyú wúwéi*) **[58]**\nand **grasps without grasping** (*zhíyú wúzhí*) **[59]**\n—just as Heaven does not speak\nyet the **four seasons proceed** (*sìshí xíng*) **[60]**\nand **all things are born** (*bǎiwù shēng*).\nHow unlike the common folk,\nwho **reckon ruin as accomplishment** (*huìnuì shìshì*) **[61]**\nand **failure as success** (*bàinuì shìgōng*)! **[62]\n\nThose who follow this path\ndo so from a **single expanse of pristine clarity** (*yīpiàn xūlíng*), **[63]**\nwholly undivided.\n\nThey **do not know what to desire** (*zìwù suǒyù*) **[64]**\nand **equally forget the idea of non-desire** (*yìbìng wángwúyù*).\nThus, it is said:\n*\"Desire is not desire.\"* **[65]\n\nEven the **precious millet** (*shúzhū*) **[66]**\nis not sought for its own sake—\nits **being arises from non-being** (*zìwú ér yǒu*), **[67]**\nso though it exists,\nit remains **non-being** (*réngwú*).\nThis **natural virtue** (*xiū suǒ zìjù*) **[68]**\nis possessed by those who cultivate the Way,\nnot needing to be sought from without.\n\nEven if one **studies** (*yǒuxué*), **[69]**\nit is as though one **studies nothing** (*réngshì wúxué*).\nThus, it is said:\n*\"Learning is not learning.\"* **[70]\n\nSimilarly, with **one’s own purity** (*yījǐ zhīchún*) **[71]**\ntransforming the **impurity of all under Heaven** (*tiānxià zhībó*), **[72]**\nor **gathering all under Heaven’s impurity** (*hé tiānxià zhībó*)\ninto **one’s own purity** (*guī yījǐ zhīchún*), **[73]\nthe sage’s **guiding and nurturing** (*yòuyè zhòngrén*) **[74]**\nand **assisting all things** (*fǔxiàng wànwù*) **[75]**\nare rooted in the natural Way alone—\nhow unlike those who **flaunt their private wisdom** (*chěng qí sīzhì*)! **[76]\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Fifth: The Sage Who Cultivates the Way**\nThe ancients who were **good at cultivating the Way** (*shàn wéidào*) **[77]**\ndid not seek to **enlighten the people** (*míng mín*) **[78]**\nbut rather to **make them simple** (*yú zhī*). **[79]\n\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause their **wisdom is excessive** (*zhī duō*).\nThus, to **govern with wisdom** (*yǐzhī zhìguó*) **[80]**\nis to **plunder the state** (*guó zhī zéi*); **[81]\nto **not govern with wisdom** (*bùyǐzhī zhìguó*)\nis to **bring the state blessings** (*guó zhī fú*).\nKnowing these two principles is the **pattern** (*kǎishì*). **[82]\n\nTo **constantly know the pattern** (*chángzhī kǎishì*)\nis called **profound virtue** (*Xuándé*).\n**[1]**\nThis **profound virtue** (*Xuándé*) **[1]**\nis deep,\nfar-reaching,\nand **contrary to things** (*yǔwù fǎn*).\nOnly then does one reach **great harmony** (*Dàshùn*). **[83]\n\nUnder Heaven, all affairs **prioritize wisdom** (*shàngzhī*) **[84]**\nbut the **Way alone does not** (*dào bù shàngzhī*)\nand instead **values simplicity** (*shàngyú*).\nSimplicity is near to the Way.\n\nThe **sage’s lineage** (*shèngmén yīguàn xīnchuán*) **[85]**\nhas been **transmitted like kindling** (*yú yú zhī*).\nOnly **simple and unrefined Zēngzǐ** (*yú Rú zhī Zēngzǐ*) **[86]**\nreceived it.\n\nThus, the ancients who were sages\n**governed the world with the Way** (*yǐdào zhìtiānxià*)\nand **met the people through the Way** (*yǔ mín xiāngjiàn yú dào*) **[87]**\n—but not like this,\nfor it is better to **transform with the people in the Way** (*yǔ mín xiānghuà yú dào*) **[88]**\nthan to **simply meet them in the Way**.\nIn **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún è’ěr*), **[89]**\nboth return to the **clear and still Heaven** (*qīngjìng zhī tiān*) **[90]—\nwhile those who merely **till fields and dig wells** (*yīshí gēngtián záo jǐng*) **[91]**\nrise with the sun and labor,\nthen rest as the sun sets,\n**forgetting the Emperor’s power** (*wàng dìlì yú héyǒu*) **[92]**\nand **following the Emperor’s Way** (*shùn dì yú bùzhī*).\n**[93]\n\nAh! How refined is their simplicity!**[94]」\n\n「Descending to later generations, the scholars and officials do not value *qu* (愚) but instead value *zhi* (智). **[95]**\nThen, scheming and contrivance proliferate, human hearts grow ever more corrupt,\ngreed and vulgarity worsen daily, and customs become increasingly deceitful.\nThe ruin of this people’s moral standards and rites, their transgressions of law and regulations,\nand the pity of those who do not fear death—**[96]**\nit is difficult to enumerate them all.\nAll are those who prize talent and cleverness, seeking false gains,\nwhile even the people’s *qu* (愚) now indulge in dark machinations.\nThe people’s natural sincerity is pierced through,\nwhile deceit and guile abound—**[97]**\nthey cheat and scheme against one another,\nand those who govern them indeed have more to manage than they can handle.\nThus it is said:\n“**To govern the state with cleverness is the state’s ruin,\nto not govern the state with cleverness is the state’s blessing.**” **[98]**\nWhy is this so?\n\nIt is because if the people are given knowledge,\ntheir undifferentiated sincerity is already broken;\nif they remain in ignorance and unawareness,\ntheir nameless simplicity is preserved.\nThe two differ in cleverness and *qu* (愚),\nand their benefits and harms are distinct.\nBetter to value *qu* (愚) and gain benefit\nthan to value cleverness and incur harm.\n\nKnowing these two principles,\nnot only does one govern the world thus,\nbut also cultivate one’s self—**[99]**\nthey are both worthy of being models.\n\nKnowing these models,\none is near the **Dao/Way**.\n\nGreat practitioners of the **Dao/Way**,\nin the state of not seeing and not hearing, **[100]**\nreturn to the spirit of no thought and no concern.\nThis cannot be achieved by merely closing one’s ears and eyes,\nor by suppressing cleverness and awareness—**[101]**\nonly then can one attain **stillness and tranquility**.\n\nIf there is even a trace of calculation,\nor a single scheming thought,\nthen the **Primordial Purity** (*Tàipǔ*) **[102]**\nis incomplete, and the **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*) **[103]**\nis lost—**[104]**\nruined indeed.\n\nKnowing that cleverness harms oneself,\nwhile *qu* (愚) benefits one’s body,\nto not flaunt one’s cleverness\nand to joyfully uphold one’s *qu* (愚)—**[105]**\nthis is called **Mysterious Virtue/Power** (*Xuándé*).\nAll that can be named is not **Mysterious Virtue/Power**;\nonly what cannot be named or spoken of,\ndeep and boundless, distant and unfathomable—**[106]**\nthis can be called **Mysterious Virtue/Power**.\n\nThough it shares with flying and creeping things,\nand with the dull and sluggish, **[107]**\nthe same lack of desire and knowledge,\nthey cannot attain the **ultimate source** (*jīngyuán*) **[108]**\nor exhaust its threads—**[109]**\nthey merely live in perpetual darkness.\nHumans, however, progress from coarse to refined,\nfrom the source to its branches,\nuntil they reach **the Three Primordials united**, **[110]**\nand the **Great Ultimate returns to the Supreme Ultimate**. **[111]**\nEven then, they may still achieve **transformation into the divine** (*shénhuà*), **[112]**\nbut it is not yet truly reversing with things. **[113]\n\nTo govern the state, one should not value cleverness,\nbut to cultivate the **Dao/Way**, one must especially cherish *qu* (愚).\nIndeed, cleverness is the state’s thief,\nwhile *qu* (愚) is the seed of the **Dao/Way**.\n\nHow can *qu* (愚) be the seed of the **Dao/Way**?\nConsider: within **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*), **[114]**\nthere is no thought or concern,\nno knowledge—**[115]**\nis this not what is called *qu* (愚)?\n\nSuddenly awakening within it,\nthis is the **non-arising, non-perishing** (*wúshēng wúmiè*) **[116]**\noriginal nature.\nNo one can claim to hold onto this awakening,\nto cultivate the **Supreme and Perfect Awakening** (*shàngshì zhèngjué zhèngjué*) **[117]**\nand thereby escape the cycle of rebirth,\nunsubjected to the **influence of yin and yang** (*yīnyáng gǔzhào*), **[118]**\nunbound by ghosts and spirits.\n\nEven within this **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*), **[119]**\nif one suddenly awakens,\nand I guard this true awakening without letting it disperse,\nthis single awakening has already reached **Prajñāpāramitā** (*bōluómí*). **[120]\nIf one can steadfastly uphold it,\nconstantly guard it,\nthen the seeds of rebirth\nwill be severed from here.\n\nIf one gives rise to another thought,\nor forms another view,\nthis is the **postnatal awareness of desire** (*shòutiān shíyù zhī shén*) **[121]**\nmixing in—**[122]**\nwhat is said:\n“**Infinite movements give rise to the root of birth and death,\nthe deluded call it the original person.**” **[123]\n\nIn essence, the spirit is one,\nbut desire makes it two.\nTwo thoughts, three minds,\nare the **defiled roots and dust** (*záwàng gēnchén*) **[124]**\nthat lead to the path of birth and death.\nOnly with one mind,\nno dual thoughts,\nhaving right awareness,\nno deluded mind—**[125]**\nthe **Dao/Way** lies here.\n\nIf one can further dissolve this single right awareness,\nthis is the **Great Ultimate returning to the Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí huán yú Wújí*), **[126]**\nand the **Golden Immortals’** (*Jīnxian*) **[127]**\nrealization lies within this refining of the void.\n\nWhat is **refining the void** (*liànxū*)?\nIt is like in the state of **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*), **[128]**\nmuddled and confused,\nas *qu* (愚) as if drunk,\nwith no awareness and no knowledge—**[129]**\nthis is the void.\nWhen seated practice reaches **no self, no person**, **[130]**\nno place, no heaven,\nthis too is refining the void.\n\nIt is further said:\n“The essentials of learning the **Dao/Way** begin with forgetting the self,\nthen forgetting others, **[131]**\nthen forgetting the **Dao/Way** itself,\nuntil one reaches the **forgetting of forgetting** (*wàngwàng zhī jí*) **[132]**\n—this is the ultimate attainment.\n\nIf one can take this single moment as master,\nand use true awakening as function,\nthe **Dao/Way** is not distant.\n\nHowever, though the method of refining the void is thus,\nits practice must begin with refining the nature.\nAncient people called this **forging the mirror** (*zhùjìng*). **[133]\n\nIf the mind is not refined,\none is dim and confused,\nunaware even if it is right before one’s eyes—**[134]**\nhow much more so for those who possess the **Six Perfections** (*liùtōng*)? **[135]\nIf one’s mind is still clouded by private desires,\nthen one has not yet reached the void.\n\nAfter true awakening,\none must not allow even a thread or fragment of desire to remain in one’s chest—**[136]\nthen the **Numinous Platform’s** (*Língtái*) **[137]**\nprecious mirror will always shine brightly,\nand yet it need not be fully perfected and complete—**[138]\nit is the emission of a single ray of light.\n\nEven within this **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*), **[139]**\nif one suddenly gains a single awareness,\nand no longer knows anything else,\nif one suddenly awakens,\nand no longer seeks another awakening—**[140]\nthis single moment is already piercing and bright,\nreaching all four directions without obstruction.\n\nThough students of the **Dao/Way** have a full vessel of private desires,\nsuddenly to expect purity like white jade or gold—**[141]\nhow could this be achieved by a single moment of voidness?\nIt is necessary first to forge the **Yin and Yang Swords** (*cíhóng èr jiàn*), **[142]**\nto eliminate the **demons of form and no-form** (*yǒuxíng wúxíng zhī mó*). **[143]\n\nIf these swords are not sharp,\nthen the **demons of desire, form, heaven, and humans** (*yùmó, sèmó, tiānmó, rénmó*) **[144]\ncannot be swept away and thoroughly purged,\nand the **true face of the Great Primordial** (*Qínyuán zhēnmiànmù*) **[145]\ncannot be revealed.\n\nFor human desires and heavenly principles\nare mixed for many years,\nthough one wishes to stand alone in the central current,\nthere are forces difficult to resist.\n\nThus, though one knows clearly,\none still transgresses—**[146]\nthis is because those who draw one into human desires are many,\nwhile those who draw one into heavenly principles are few.\n\nNow I tell those who study:\nTo achieve a **pure and still body of dharma** (*qīngjìng fǎshēn*), **[147]\none must first have a pure and still spirit.\nTo obtain a pure and still spirit,\none must have **vast and boundless qi**.\nWhat is called forging the swords has no other method—**[148]\nit is by nurturing the **morning qi** (*píngdàn zhī qì*) **[149]\ndirectly without harm,\nuntil one attains the **vast and mighty** (*hàorán gāngdà*). **[150]」\n\nOnce the spirit-sword is forged and its edge sharp,\nit can cleave demons and sever evil.\nAt that time,\nno matter how alluring the seductive sounds or beautiful forms may be,\nthe mind remains undisturbed—\neven if a fair maiden lies beside one in sleep,\none would not know.\nNo matter how fierce the malevolent spirits or ominous omens approach,\nthe spirit remains unshaken—\neven if a mountain like Tai collapses before one,\nthere would be no fear.\n\nThose who forge this spirit-sword\nmust possess a will as resolute as the divine—\nyet they often falter in practice,\nstarting and stopping,\nunwilling to firmly establish their footing at once.\n\nIf one can sever with a single stroke,\nand extinguish a private thought the moment it arises,\nnever allowing it to resurface,\nthen the path of birth-and-death’s cycle is cut.\nThe Daoist student has no other secret—\nonly fear of failing to recognize the mirror-sword of clarity.\nIf one recognizes it,\nthen in this instant, the luminous mirror shines universally,\nadmitting no evil or delusion,\nwhile the wisdom-sword hangs suspended—\ndesire-demons are severed at once.\nFrom this moment, if one holds fast to a single thought,\nthen the divine chamber may be formed,\nand the elixir refined.\n\nThis luminous mirror and wisdom-sword\nare the essential tasks of the cultivator.\nIf the sword’s edge is dull,\nhow can it sever evil spirits?\nThus, the more one restrains the heart,\nthe more it becomes disordered.\nIf the precious mirror lacks light,\nhow can one distinguish principle from desire?\nThus, the more one strives to overcome,\nthe more it multiplies.\n\nMencius spoke of nurturing *qi* but not of nurturing the heart—\ntruly, when *qi* is sufficient, the heart naturally settles.\nThose who merely force the heart,\nwithout knowing that righteousness generates *qi*,\nare far from the Dao.\n\nLi Erqu said:\n*\"The human heart is naturally joyous,\nyet it binds itself with private desires.\nWhen private desires first arise,\nthe clear knowing still perceives it.\nOnce perceived, it is dispelled at once—\nthis heart remains joyous as before.\"*\n\nThe humble old man said:\n*\"Luminous and silent, it pervades the sands of the river—\nthe mundane and the sage originally share one home.\nWhen not a thought arises, the whole body manifests;\nthe six senses stir, yet are veiled by clouds.\nSevering vexations only increases suffering,\nseeking True Suchness is also delusion.\nWorldly affairs follow their course without obstruction,\nNirvana and death are but empty flowers.\"*\n\nLet those who study heart-nature ponder these words thrice!\n\n**Chapter 66: The King of All Valleys**\nThe reason the river and sea can be the king of all valleys\nis that they excel in descending—\nthus they become the king of all valleys.\n\nTherefore, the Sage who wishes to surpass others\nmust first speak in a way that places them below;\nwho wishes to lead others\nmust first place themselves behind.\nThus, the Sage, though in high station, is not feared,\nthough in the forefront, is not resented.\nThus, the world willingly follows without tiring.\n\nBecause they do not contend,\nthe world cannot contend with them.\n\nAll people wish others to serve them,\nyet some, though unwilling to serve, are served,\nwhile others, though eager to be served, are served even less—\nthis is because they exalt themselves,\nunwilling to lower their hearts or humble their *qi*.\n\nObserve how the river and sea are where all valleys flow—\nit is because they descend that they become the king of valleys.\nIf the river and sea were to place themselves above the valleys,\nthough the valleys might still flow toward them,\nwhat would receive them?\nThus, the Sage perceives this early:\nto surpass others, one must speak in a way that places them below—\nas Yao consulted the Four Mountains,\nand Shun inquired of the Four Gates—\nall teachings, commands, and matters\nwere sought from ministers and neighbors,\nnever exalting their own wisdom.\nThis is why the more one descends,\nthe more others ascend.\n\nTo lead others, one must place oneself behind—\nas Yu, Gao, and Yi, though enlightened first,\nin all things yielded precedence to others,\nplacing themselves last.\nThis is why the more one retreats,\nthe more others advance.\n\nBecause they place themselves below and behind,\neven seated on the imperial throne,\nthey lack the awe of tyranny—\nthus, they are not feared.\nThough they hold the mandate of the divine,\nthey lack the harshness of domination—\nthus, they are not resented.\nTherefore, the world willingly follows them as leaders,\nwithout a trace of aversion.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"There is none there who is evil,\nhere none who is exhausted.\nMay it be that night and day,\nto perpetuate one’s good name.\"*\nWhat else is this but:\nbecause they do not contend for superiority or precedence,\nothers naturally place them above and before,\nrevering their teachings, fearing their spirit,\nand endlessly receiving their grace and virtue—\nhow could they then dare to contend for superiority or precedence,\nand vie with the Sage for victory?\n\nThis is an analogy for elixir refinement:\nfirst, the divine fire descends into the elixir field,\nthen the fire steams and the water boils,\nand gold forms at the water’s base—\nonly then does the elixir of longevity emerge.\n\nHumans receive the central essence of Heaven and Earth to live,\noriginally complete and whole.\nYet after birth,\n*qi* and constitution constrain them,\nand desires obscure them—\nthe original *qi* of Heaven,\nlong scattered through the body’s stale *qi*,\ncannot be gathered in one place for ages.\n\nNow, to converge the Five Phases,\nharmonize the Four Symbols,\nunite them in the central palace,\nand return to the mysterious orifice—\none must first release all entanglements,\nallow no private thoughts to arise,\nlower the curtain to seal the mouth,\nview with the eyes through the nose,\noppose the nose to the navel,\nand descend the heart-fire into the elixir field—\nin but a moment’s work,\nthe mysterious passage opens,\nand the primal Yang returns.\nThe *qi* of the whole body\nnaturally gathers in the elixir field,\nfusing and effervescing,\na joy beyond naming.\n\nYet at the outset of observation,\nif the fire is not intense, the metal does not emerge from the ore;\nif the fire is too fierce, it scorches the essence and blood,\nstifling the vital spark.\nOnly when it clings yet does not adhere,\nis present yet absent,\ndoes the *qi* of the elixir field leap with movement.\n\nThis is like the river and sea’s ability to descend to all valleys—\nthe valleys thus flow toward them.\nThe Sage can descend to all under Heaven—\nthus all under Heaven turns to them.\n\nIn a single body,\nthe heart is the most exalted and noble,\nwhile all other limbs are small and lowly.\n\n「——The Dao/Way thus uses the vastness of the river and sea and the nobility of the Sage to illustrate the heart,\nwhile the smallness of the valleys and the lowliness of the myriad people serve to illustrate the hundred bodies,\nillustrating the **elixir field**.\n\nPractitioners of the Dao/Way must also take \"descending\" as their foundation,\ntake \"lowliness\" as their base,\nand not place themselves above the noble and exalted,\nso that they may descend beneath others—\nthus what they achieve will be effortless.\n\nAs for ordinary mortals,\ntheir essence (*shén*) is the master,\nwhile their *qi* follows its movements of activity and rest,\ngiving rise to birth and death,\nto the creation and nurturing of males and females.\n\nBut the **Perfect Person** (*zhìrén*) takes *qi* as the master,\nand their essence (*shén*) obeys its transformations and shifts.\nAs the *Treasure of Awakening* says,\n*\"Though others are the hosts, I am the guest\"*—this is so.\n\nFor those who truly cultivate the Dao/Way,\nwhen the *qi* moves,\nthey reverse the workings of Nature,\nupset the order of Heaven and Earth,\nand merely listen as it ascends and descends,\nenters and exits the furnace,\nsealing and refining—\nthen await the true essence,\ncycling and turning,\nnever relying on the essence (*shén*) to govern it.\n\nBut when they observe the true *qi* in its harmonious surge,\nand reverse the natural order in their cultivation,\nthe work is complete in nine cycles,\nthe elixir ripens, the pearl becomes luminous—\nis this not exalted, towering above all?\n\nResplendent, they stand first—\nyet how can they be the revered ones of the ten thousand households,\nthe objects of admiration for all under Heaven?\n\nOnly when they dwell in lowliness and follow behind in this manner,\ndoes their single-minded and tranquil aspiration,\ntheir humble and harmonious heart,\nprevent the overturning of the elixir field or the furnace,\nthe flight of mercury or the scattering of lead.\nThus, when they are above, others do not weigh them down;\nwhen they are before, others do not harm them.\nSince they do not contend,\nall under Heaven cannot contend with them.\n\n**Chapter 67: I Possess Three Treasures**\nAll under Heaven say I am great—\nit seems I do not resemble them.\nFor only the great can seem not to resemble them;\nif I resembled them, long ago I would have been small.\n\nI possess Three Treasures,\nwhich I hold and preserve:\nthe first is called **compassion** (*cí*),\nthe second is called **frugality** (*jiǎn*),\nthe third is **not daring to act before all under Heaven**.\n\nFor compassion (*cí*) brings forth courage;\nfrugality (*jiǎn*) brings forth breadth;\nnot daring to act before all under Heaven\nbrings forth completion and longevity.\n\nNow to abandon compassion (*cí*) for courage,\nto abandon frugality (*jiǎn*) for breadth,\nto abandon following behind for acting first—\nthis is death.\n\nFor compassion (*cí*), when used in battle, brings victory;\nwhen used in defense, brings firmness.\nWhen Heaven intends to save them,\nit shields them with compassion (*cí*).\n\nThe Dao/Way is originally boundless,\nyet it is also the **Great Ultimate** (*tàijí*).\nNeither great nor small,\nneither great nor small—\nit is both great and small.\n\nThere are indeed words beyond thought and conjecture that cannot be exhausted.\nIf one insists on calling it \"great,\"\nthen *\"the boundless and mighty *qi*,\nfilling the space between Heaven and Earth\"* is the description.\nIf one seeks to depict it as \"small,\"\nthen *\"the nameless gem,\nmost hidden and subtle,\nconcealed in the vast expanse\"* is the portrayal.\n\nIn its relation to humanity,\nto possess it means life,\nto lose it means death.\nAll arise from the boundless yet manifest,\nfrom the subtle yet becoming substantial.\n\nFor indeed, the origin lies in the subtle,\nwhile its unfolding is in the great.\nBetter to speak of its smallness to reveal the Dao/Way\nthan to speak of its greatness to explain it.\n\nThus the Dao/Way says,\n*\"All under Heaven says I am great.\"*\n\nFor \"I\" is the Dao/Way itself.\nThe Dao/Way originally has no form, no body—\nyet now it is called \"great,\"\nwhich implies the Dao/Way has form and body that can be likened—\nthis seems not to resemble the Dao/Way.\n\nOnly the great cannot be named as \"great,\"\nso it does not resemble what others call \"great.\"\nIf one wishes to embody the Dao/Way of Heaven,\nto resemble my form,\nfrom the opening of Heaven to the present day,\nthose who established the poles of Heaven,\nwho expounded the Dao/Way and clarified the teachings—\nlong ago,\nthey all used the **Ultimate of Boundlessness** (*wújí*) as the ultimate,\nthe **non-divine essence** (*bùshén*’s *shén*) as the essence,\nthe most subtle and minute as the Dao/Way.\n\nYet the Dao/Way is so silent and odorless,\nso vague and distant—\nhow then can scholars begin to cultivate it?\n\nThe Dao/Way says,\n*\"I possess Three Treasures,\nwhich I hold and preserve.\"*\nIf one earnestly does not lose them,\ntreasures them as treasures,\nand never forgets them,\nthen one may return to the origin,\nrestore the source,\nand revive the primordial descent of the Sovereign.\n\nWhat are these Three Treasures?\nThe first is compassion (*cí*), which is also **benevolence** (*rén*).\nBenevolent and compassionate,\nit is the fundamental essence of Heaven.\nThe gentleman embodies benevolence (*rén*),\nand this suffices to nurture humanity.\n\nMoreover, it encompasses the four cardinal virtues,\nand includes all virtues—\nbenevolence (*rén*) is within them,\nand thus the Dao/Way is within them.\nPursue it to its fullest,\nand it can embrace Heaven and Earth,\npermeate past and present.\n\nThis is the foundation of the **Golden Elixir** (*jīndān*),\nwhich cultivators should earnestly treasure and reflect upon.\n\nYet its Dao/Way extends to the utmost greatness,\nwhile its roots arise from the utmost subtlety.\nIf one does not know to forget all thoughts,\nto inwardly illuminate with a single awareness,\nbut instead only strives for breadth and becomes scattered,\nfor comprehensiveness and becomes superficial,\nthen they will gain nothing of benevolence (*rén*),\nnothing of the Dao/Way.\n\nOnly when one turns inward to seek within themselves,\nsteadfastly guards it in the heart,\nand when they wish to establish, they establish for others,\nwhen they wish to reach, they reach for others—\nthis is the ancient saying:\n*\"To grasp one is to accomplish all ten thousand affairs.\"*\nIs this not the essence of frugality (*jiǎn*)?\n\nFor frugality (*jiǎn*) is the method to seek benevolence (*rén*),\nthe key to cultivating the Dao/Way.\nScholars, having known its compassion (*cí*),\nshould further nourish it with frugality (*jiǎn*),\nonly then can they align with the Dao/Way.\n\nAlthough,\nif one is self-proclaimed as great and exalted,\nand lacks the measure of humility and harmony,\nthen within they only know themselves,\nand outwardly they disdain all others.\nThey boast of their cleverness,\nand arrogantly claim wisdom—\nthey proudly declare themselves as those who first awaken and first harmonize,\noften believing that none under Heaven can surpass them—\nin the end,\ntheir nature is not tranquil,\ntheir *qi* is not harmonious,\nand even if they wish for the elixir to complete nine cycles,\nfor the Dao/Way to reach the ninth heaven—\nthis is difficult indeed.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The essential key to refining the elixir is\nto take **awakened awareness** (*língjué*) as the Dao/Way’s form,\nand **harmonious surge** (*chōnghé*) as the Dao/Way’s function.\nThus, in all things and places,\none should not dare to act before all under Heaven.\"*\n\nMoreover, compassion (*cí*) is\nthe innate capacity of human hearts.\nTo exhaust one’s own heart\nin establishing the fate of all things—\nwhat a vast vow!\nTo nourish the nature of a single inch\nin seeking the peace of all things—\nwhat a mighty spirit!\n\nThose who guard compassion (*cí*)\nare those who cultivate courage.\nZengzi said to Zixiang,\n*\"When reflecting upon oneself and not shrinking back,\neven if clad in coarse garments and living in a humble dwelling,\nI would not fear.\"*」\n\nSelf-reflection brings contraction—\nthough facing ten thousand men,\nI would still go forward.\n\nIs there one who possesses a single piece of compassion,\nyet lacks the courage to bend even a hair?\nNecessarily, what one guards must be restrained,\nbefore what one extends can be vast.\nWithout restraint, how can there be breadth?\n\nOnly by carefully attending to actions,\nmoderating thoughts,\nfocusing the mind within the inch of heart,\ngathering the hundred limbs at the elixir field—\nendlessly, unceasingly,\nunbroken, unflagging,\nunceasingly pure—\nwithout slackness, without waste,\none naturally refines the self\nand the world finds peace.\n\nWithout frugality, how could there be breadth?\n\nTo dare not act before all under Heaven—\nthis is the radiant virtue of humility and reverence,\nthe stable and auspicious goodness.\nIf one can yield and conform to all under Heaven,\nnone will dare contend with them,\nand if one can follow and receive the Dao/Way,\nthe Dao/Way in silence will aid its fulfillment.\nWithout the virtue of harmonious surge,\nhow dare one act before all under Heaven,\nand yet achieve such greatness in late maturity?\n\nThus, compassion, frugality, and yielding—\nthese are the fundamental beginnings of seeking the Dao/Way.\nCourage, breadth, and precedence—\nthese are the later manifestations of serving the Dao/Way.\n\nYet today’s scholars are not so.\nAbandoning compassion for courage,\nthey nurture a heart of ruthlessness;\nabandoning frugality for breadth,\nthey harbor greedy desires;\nabandoning yielding for precedence,\nthey court contention—\nall are paths to death.\nEven if they barely survive,\nthey are but walking corpses among the living,\nmingling recklessly with the crowd—\nwhat difference is there between them and the dead?\n\nIn summary, compassion is the vital principle of humanity,\na nature shared by all.\nOnly by guarding it with restraint,\nexpressing it with harmony,\ndoes compassion and pity flow naturally from sincerity,\nand none under Heaven can fail to be moved and submit.\nCompassion suffices to command others—\nthe virtuous have no rival.\nWhy should they not be invincible in battle,\nunshakable in defense,\nand free from shame before all under Heaven?\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\n*\"Heaven’s dark and nurturing influence descends upon the people,\nharmonizing their dwellings.\"*\nGranting them life and fulfillment,\nthey eternally enjoy the peace of Heaven—\nthis is what is meant by Heaven’s intent to save them.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"The mandate of Heaven is profound and unceasing.\"*\nIt reveals the pure and boundless *qi*,\nflowing and unfailing, boundless in its nurturing—\ntruly, it is guarded by compassion alone.\n\nThe Dao/Way is called the Great Dao,\nits essence is the boundless and the Supreme Ultimate.\nYet without beginning from the boundless,\nhow could one, amid the indistinct and formless,\ndiscern the origins of the Supreme Ultimate’s roots?\n\nScholars must first clarify the Dao’s source,\nwithin the unseen and unheard,\nseeking the most hidden and subtle essence—\nthis is the so-called empty yet responsive.\n\nThough its subtlety is extreme—\nlike a grain of millet or a pearl—\nit is as if there were something to perceive.\nIn truth, it is form without form,\nshape without shape—\napproach it, and you see no head;\nfollow it, and you see no tail.\nIt is the gentle compassion within the human heart.\n\nEven the most hardened and base of men\ncannot extinguish their innate compassion.\nConfucius said:\n*\"If I desire virtue,\nvirtue will immediately come.\"*\n\n「Refining the elixir—what else is there to it?\nIt is nothing but nurturing this innate compassion.\n\nWhat is this compassion?\nLike King Qi of the State of Qi who, seeing a cow trembling in fear, could not bear to harm it,\nor a commoner who, upon witnessing a weak child fall into a well, feels a surge of pity—\nthese are all stirrings of the *ren* heart,\nwhere the *Dao*’s gentle breath returns.\n\nWhen one reflects upon this,\nthis impulse, this thought, is ever-present—\nonly fearing that men may not yet perceive it.\n\nScholars must begin from the natural and true,\nexpanding and cultivating outward,\nthus laying the foundation for elixir refinement.\n\nYet one must not seek breadth at the expense of neglect—\nonly guard simplicity and subtlety.\n\nWith a single mind devoted to preserving life,\nand the five senses in full submission,\nthe ancients said:\n*\"The heart must dwell within the chest,\nand thoughts must never stray beyond the *Zongzhi* gate.\"*\n\nFrom this, the more refined the simplicity,\nthe broader the expansion;\nthe more subtle the essence,\nthe more manifest its brilliance.\n\nThe more precise the restraint,\nthe more vast its reach.\nCan scholars not take frugality as their root?\n\nThough *virtue/power* lies in humility,\nstrict simplicity is indeed a fine method to avoid loss—\nyet if one does not temper it with modesty and harmony,\nthe danger of impulsive violence may arise,\nlike flames scorching the elixir.\nThus, guarding simplicity must also be utterly harmonious,\never humble, ever small,\nnever presuming to lead—\nonly then does one achieve *emptiness* and serve others.\n\nWhen compassion is ever-present,\nthe *Dao*’s breath will surely remain.\n\nIf one values courage over compassion,\nluxury over frugality,\nand seeks to lead rather than follow,\nhow can one hope to possess the Three Treasures,\nunshaken and unlost?\n\nMoreover, compassion brings favor—\nuse it in battle, and victory will be certain;\nemploy it in defense, and the fortress will stand firm.\nThis is like the metaphor of tending the furnace,\nburning away the Three Corpses of malice,\nand bathing in the *Dao*’s purity—\nthus safeguarding the embryo, the fetus, and the original spirit.\n\nIt is this gentle and harmonious heart\nthat is essential for refining the elixir and nurturing the *Dao*.\n\nConsider that Heaven, in creating man,\ngrants him life and endows him with compassion—\nnone are without it.\nIf one can temper thoughts to align with compassion,\nthe elixir of eternal life is already within reach.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Virtue of Non-Contention**\nA true warrior does not rely on force,\na true fighter does not rage,\na true victor does not contend,\nand a true leader serves those beneath him.\n\nThis is the virtue of non-contention,\nthis is the power of serving others,\nthis is aligning with Heaven—\nthe ancient ideal.\n\nWarriors (*shì*, 士), are judges of men.\nJudges of men wield armies,\nand their essence is martial valor.\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"Firm yet responsive, venturing risks while yielding to them,\nmighty in spirit yet never slaying.\"*\nThis is martial valor without violence—\nthe warrior’s true excellence.\n\nWhen facing a great enemy,\ntwo armies locked in battle,\none must not fail to deploy troops,\nbrandish weapons, and charge with the fury of rivers and thunder.\nYet, when examined closely,\nsoldiers are few—\nyet a mighty foe suddenly presses the borders.\nIt is not difficult to repel the invaders of the Central Plains\nwith music, or to break the siege of a hostile state\nwith harmonious melodies.\nThis is the power of unyielding yet without anger—\nthe iron mace tempered in gentleness.\n\nWhen the time comes to return in triumph,\nvibrant with victory,\nwhile others boast in the court,\nhe alone humbles himself—\nthe so-called \"Great Tree General\"—\nand can stand without shame.\n\nEven if rewards are lavishly bestowed,\nhe remains ever modest—\nthis is how the true victor does not contend.\n\nThe *Shū* says:\n*\"You alone do not contend,\nand thus none under Heaven can contend with you.\"*\nIs this not what it means?\n\nSuch men arise from heeding wise counsel,\ngathering broad thoughts for mutual benefit,\nnot relying on their own talents,\nbut using the talents of others as their own;\nnot boasting of their own wisdom,\nbut employing the wisdom of others as their own.\n\nThis is the meaning of humbling oneself to serve others.\nIf one does not listen to noble words,\nconsult good paths,\nkeep an open heart like a valley,\nand maintain modesty while shining with virtue,\nhow can one hope to rule the world\nwith the skill of a warrior or victor?\n\nThis is the virtue of non-contention,\nwhich wins the people.\n\nThis is the power of serving others,\nwhich commands the world.\n\nThis is the way of following the people below,\naligning with Heaven above—\nthus winning the hearts of the people.\n\nThis is the power of serving others,\nwhich commands the world.\n\nThis is the way of following the people below,\naligning with Heaven above—\nto stand with Heaven and Earth,\nand achieve the ancient ideal of humanity.\n\nAlas! Without the saint’s utmost sincerity,\nexhausting his nature,\nhow could one, in the midst of war and chaos,\nembody the spirit of peace and courtesy,\nwielding force without violence,\nacting in anger yet without rage,\ncontending yet without strife?\n\nAnd when it comes to ruling with benevolence,\nplanning with humility,\nplacing the worthy in office,\nand employing the capable in their roles—\nthe men of the world all offer their loyalty,\npour out their sincerity,\nand eagerly rush to perform their duties,\nsacrificing their lives as commanded—\nas the seasons flow naturally without speech,\nand all things present their offerings in harmony,\nthis is how one aligns with Heaven and Earth\nand achieves the ancient ideal of humanity.\n\nThe *Shī* says:\n*\"Ponder the virtuous Lord Ji, who aligned with Heaven,\nand none could surpass his excellence.\"*\nIf not for such men, who else could we follow?\n\nThis speaks of the elixir’s growth and the furnace’s fire—\nthough there are methods of fierce refining and rapid tempering,\nthey must still adapt to the moment,\nfollow the natural course,\nand act with force without violence—\nthus avoiding the calamity of overturned elixir or shattered crucible.\n\nWhen the *qi*’s movement is unrestrained,\nthe true *yang* energy flourishes,\nmighty and unyielding,\nfilling the two great voids—\nwhat difference is there from a warrior’s blazing fury,\nsweeping all before him?\n\nEven when gathering and refining the fire,\nit is only because the boundless *qi* is expanded—\nnot a love of strength for its own sake.\n\nThus, after purification,\ncommon bones transmute into jade bones,\nand mortal flesh becomes a golden body.\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"Taking the Golden Elixir in the palm of one’s hand\nis like seizing the world as one would pick up a mustard seed.\"*\n\nOnly when the spirit is concentrated without distraction,\nand breath is regulated without effort,\ndoes one purely follow Heaven,\nunmixed with human interference.\nEven when Heaven and man clash,\nreason and desire vie,\none must not fail to suppress desire with reason,\nand exhaust humanity to merge with Heaven.\n\nWhen study reaches its essence and virtue is perfected,\nwhen compassion is deep and wisdom mature—\nfree of all selfish ambition, of striving for merit or skill—\nthis is how the virtuous stand unchallenged beneath Heaven and Earth.\n\nSuch is the way of the humble and yielding,\nof emptying oneself to serve others,\nlistening to the rise and fall of *qi* and moving with it.\nThus the Elixir forms unseen yet manifest,\nunchanging yet transforming,\neffortless yet complete—\nwhat difference is there from a master’s skill in guiding others?\n\nIn cultivating the human Dao,\nif one remains ever at peace,\never yielding,\ndesire suppressed without force,\nvirtue upheld without effort—\nthis is the virtue of *wu zheng* [non-contention].\n\nWith a heart of non-contention,\nfollowing principle to act,\nresponding to circumstances with ease—\nit is as if using others’ strength to achieve one’s own purpose,\nthus encompassing Heaven and Earth’s transformations without overreaching.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"What does Heaven speak? The four seasons move in it,\nand all things take life from it.\"*\n\nThe Sage aligns with the Dao’s truth,\nupright as the celestial threads and terrestrial measures,\nsetting the standard for all ages to come.\n\n**Chapter LXIX: The Victorious Through Compassion**\n\nThere is a military saying:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor while the enemy is passive,\nnor advance an inch without retreating a foot.\"*\n\nThis is called:\nmoving without moving,\npushing without arms,\nholding without weapons,\nyet standing unconquered.\n\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—\nto do so risks losing what is most precious.\nThus, when armies clash,\nthe compassionate prevail.\n\nAncient strategists spoke thus:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor but must be the guest.\"*\nThe aggressor is like a sovereign—\none who issues commands and rules with authority;\nthe guest is like a minister—\none who obeys the sovereign’s will, as in *\"Let others be the host, I the guest.\"*\n\nThus, when I am the aggressor,\nit is the post-Heaven human heart that takes command,\nwhile the pre-Heaven Dao-heart steps back in submission.\nHow dare I make the post-Heaven human heart the aggressor,\nonly to then make it the guest,\nrelying on it as if it were my very life?\n\n*\"I dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot\"* means:\nwhen victorious, even an inch gained must be held firm;\nwhen defeated, not even a single step withdrawn may be conceded.\nTo advance an inch in gain while retreating a foot in loss—\nthis is to gain little and lose much,\neasy to fail, hard to succeed.\nIn warfare, this is the mark of an incompetent general;\nin Dao cultivation, this is the fate of one who achieves nothing.\nHow dare I?\n\nOnly by yielding to others as the aggressor,\nsubmitting myself as the guest,\ncan I ensure they have openings to exploit,\nwhile I have no vulnerabilities to attack—\nthus controlling others without being controlled,\navoiding humiliation.\n\nAdvance when opportunity arises,\nretreat when danger looms.\nIn advancing, one must rouse the spirit of boldness;\nin retreating, one must not present a vulnerable posture.\nSuch caution, such vigilance—\nit is nothing but always yielding precedence to others,\nwhile placing oneself last.\n\nThus, when marching an army,\nit seems others can move while I cannot;\nyet when I press forward with resolve,\nbrandishing my arms—\nit seems others have arms while I have none.\nWhen facing the enemy in battle,\ntwo armies locked in combat—\nit seems others can contend while I cannot.\n\nThough drums thunder and flags billow,\nthough they wield weapons, I do not lack arms.\nYet I advance not lightly, retreat not lightly—\ntruly knowing that the fate of the state,\nthe rise or fall of the nation,\nrests on this single battle.\nHow can the enemy be treated with contempt?\n\nObserve the ancients who treated the enemy with caution—\nthey often succeeded;\nthose who underestimated the enemy—\nthey often failed.\nAs seen in Guan Zhong’s campaign against the Shanrong,\nor Zi Yu’s battle at Chengpu.\n\nMoreover, the prosperity or decline of the court\ndepends on the success or failure of its generals.\nIf one does not approach matters with utmost prudence,\nbut instead flaunts their talent or relies on their wit,\nboasting *\"None surpass me\"*—\nlike Meng Ming’s reckless advance or Gao Gu’s overconfidence—\nthere has never been one who did not bring ruin to the state,\ndestroy their own house,\nor extinguish their ancestral rites.\n\nThe Sage’s greatest treasure is *xin* [trust].\nTo underestimate the enemy is to betray the sovereign’s trust.\n\nWhen two armies oppose each other,\ntwo forces clash—\nyet one remains weak, yielding,\nutterly compassionate and benevolent.\nThey fear the *sha fa* [killing energy] disrupting Heaven and Earth’s harmony,\nand take no joy in military might expanding territory.\nWarfare is resorted to only as a last necessity.\nThough no weeping for fallen soldiers,\nthe heart of compassion and sorrow\nalready permeates the assembled armies,\nand the common people are moved to gratitude.\n\nThus, the virtuous either do not war,\nor if they do, they prevail.\nIs this not because the heart of sorrow\nextends to others,\nentering their very beings?\n\nThis illustrates the birth of true *yang* energy,\nthe *qi* flourishing—\nonly then may the fire be refined.\nIf one does not patiently await the *yin* [lead] *qi*’s movement,\nbut instead forces the spirit’s ascent and descent,\nadvance and retreat in rigid cycles—\nthere will be no failure to burn the body with wild fire,\nto suffer great humiliation.\n\nAt the four critical junctures,\none must await the *kan* [water] *qi*’s natural impulse,\nlest *li* [fire] usurp dominance—\nhence, *\"I dare not be the aggressor but must be the guest.\"*\n\nIn the Dao of cultivation,\nprogress is constant, regression brings disaster.\nLike Heaven’s ceaseless motion,\nwater’s unceasing flow—\nonly thus does one ascend daily.\nIf one proceeds intermittently, then halts,\nexposed to cold after brief warmth—\nthis is to advance an inch while retreating a foot,\ngaining little, losing much,\nand thus never achieving success in this lifetime.\n\nThis arises from ignorance of the way of returning to the Root,\nrestoring the Mandate—\nthe path of daily practice,\nwhich cannot be seized by clever schemes,\nnor attained through contrivance.\n\nTo cultivate the Dao of alchemy in reverse—\nto align with Nature’s spontaneous flow—\nis to learn as though unlearning,\nto labor without labor,\nto follow the natural sequence,\nto advance with the momentum,\nunhindered, unforced—\nlike Yu taming the floods,\nacting where no action is needed.\n\nIf one recklessly stokes the fire,\nlightly advancing and retreating,\nit is like a general underestimating the enemy—\nnever fails to kindle disaster,\nburning the elixir,\nshattering the furnace and crucible,\nuntil lead and mercury scatter in ruin.\n\nAh! To trust Nature purely,\nwith reverent caution,\nis to weave through radiance unbroken.\nBut if one contrives clever schemes,\nthe treasure of longevity\nwill be ravaged by the post-heaven corpse-thief,\ndestroyed utterly—\nhow then could one hope for an elixir\nboth enduring and vast?\n\nOnly with boundless compassion,\ntenfold sorrow,\ndoes one act with peace,\nproceed with gentleness—\nthen Nature yields without resistance,\nand victory is inevitable.\n\nThe seeker must not let post-heaven intellect dominate,\nbut let primordial *qi* retreat and listen.\nOnly then may one avoid error.\n\n**Chapter Seventy: The Humble Garment, the Precious Jade**\nMy words are easy to know,\neasy to practice.\nYet none under Heaven can know them,\nnone can practice them.\n\nWords have their root,\naffairs have their master.\nOnly the ignorant fail to recognize me.\nFew know me—\nthus I am noble.\n\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse rags,\nyet cradles jade within.\nHe obscures his traces in mountains and caves,\nhiding his life in rocks and hollows—\nonly to follow the nature of life and fate,\nharmonize with Heaven and Earth,\ncultivate what lies within himself,\nwhile others’ knowledge or ignorance\nhe does not concern himself with.\nThus the wise grow wiser,\nwhile the foolish grow more foolish.\n\nThe Supreme’s words—\nevery line is Dao,\nevery character touches the self.\nTo speak of Dao is to speak of the self,\nand to speak of the self is to speak of Dao—\nnothing is simpler than this.\nYet what is difficult to know or practice?\n\nIt is only that people seek far\nwhen the Dao is near,\ndemand difficulty\nwhen the matter is easy.\nThey neglect the true, constant Dao,\nand instead pursue dregs and remnants—\nlike rhetoric, memorization, legalisms, and divination.\nThe more they learn, the more their minds stray;\nthe more they do, the more their nature decays.\nNo wonder the Supreme’s words\nwere universally understood in his time,\nyet only he alone preserved them afterward.\nIt is because they failed to grasp\nthat words have a root,\naffairs have a master.\n\nThis root, this master—\nit is the “middle” within the self.\nWhen Yao and Shun passed on the heart-transmission,\nit was nothing but *“faithfully holding to the middle.”*\nLater, in Confucius’ *“pure unity”*,\nZengzi’s *“solitary vigilance”*,\nWang Yangming’s *“innate knowledge”*—\nall point to the self’s *“middle.”*\nThis *“middle”* encompasses much.\n\nWithin the body, it lies in guarding the *xing* (formal) middle—\nZhu Xi said: *“Guard the middle, regulate the outer.”*\nTo guard the middle is to turn light inward,\nfocus on the center.\nAt the point one inch below the navel—\nneither clinging nor rejecting.\n\nIt also lies in guarding the formless middle—\nas the *Zhongyong* says:\n*“Before joy, anger, sorrow, or delight arise—this is the middle.”*\nLu Congyan taught Li Yanping:\n*“In stillness, observe the state before joy, anger, sorrow, or delight arise—\nthis unseen, unheard moment,\nwhere caution and awe are natural,\nnature settles, the spirit clears,\nand the original face appears.\nThen human desires grow pure,\nHeaven’s principle shines anew.\nSince ancient sages, immortals, and Buddhas—\nall took this as their first step.\nYet one must first guard the strenuous middle,\nand finally attain the effortless middle.”*\n\nThough the Three Teachings name it differently,\nthey all take *“middle”* as root and master.\nEven in my teaching—\nto concentrate the spirit, regulate the breath,\nthen return to observe the original orifice,\nletting the heart have no heart,\nthe *qi* have no *qi*—\nonly then does the heart grow still,\nthe breath harmonize.\nThe key lies in *“heart still.”*\nNo disturbance in the heart is stillness;\nto hold fast to the middle is stillness.\nStillness is within this middle.\n\nThe heart here is the *Xuan Guan* orifice of the *Dan Jing*—\nwhen spirit and *qi* become interdependent,\nthe substance of *Xuan Guan* is already established,\nthis is the root of the Dao/Way,\nthe origin of the Golden Elixir.\n\nAs for advancing fire and retreating symbols,\nshifting and transporting the *He Che*,\nall actions and efforts—\nthey ultimately value humility, harmony,\nsoftness, and compliance.\n\nBe composed and tranquil,\nneither aiding nor neglecting.\nWhat is essential returns to the Void,\nyet the Void gives rise to the Form.\nWhen Form and Void stand not,\nthen one aligns with Heaven’s natural Dao/Way.\n\nThis is the attainment of unity,\nwhereby all matters are concluded—\nthe essence of my teaching’s *“One with a thread that runs through all.”*\n\nIf scholars grasp this thus,\nthe *Taishang*’s subtleties may be understood,\nand they shall not be misled by peripheral or heterodox paths.\n\nIf one fails to recognize the *宗* of speech,\nthe *君* of practice,\nand does not permit entry into the hall of truth\nwhile wandering in other directions—\nthe person who knows this and acts accordingly\nwill naturally find fulfillment within,\nno longer coveting the external.\nLike the sage who bears coarse robes yet harbors precious virtue,\nthey radiate effortlessly, ceaselessly.\n\n**Chapter 71: The Superiority of Knowing the Unknown**\n*\"Knowing the unknown\"* is superior—\n\n「Unknown yet knowing, is an ailment.\nOnly when one recognizes this ailment as an ailment,\ndoes one truly avoid falling ill.\n\nThe sage does not fall ill,\nbecause they recognize the ailment of knowing what they do not know,\nthus they do not fall ill.\n\nWhen illuminated by sagacious wisdom,\none’s mind is like a spotless mirror,\nstill water without ripples—\nall things come and are reflected with perfect clarity,\nnot the slightest trace of evasion.\n\nThis is the divine insight, naturally penetrating;\nit arises from things as their condition,\nemerging like the heart’s own expression.\nNot conjectured as clarity,\nnor divined as knowledge.\n\nTheir knowing stems from the innate luminosity of nature,\nnot from preordained foresight,\nyet they discern what others cannot.\n\nThis is the loftiest of sages,\nnot the reach of common folk.\n\nCommon folk cannot fathom principles with their intelligence,\nnor illuminate things with their insight—\nthey often surmise the sincerity or deceit of others,\nand guess at the rise or fall of matters—\nif by chance they hit upon the truth,\npeople call their mind clear as a mirror,\nand they themselves boast of their piercing discernment like a god.\n\nThis kind of divined knowing\nis not the divine penetration of insight,\nbut forcing ignorance into knowledge:\nthough they claim to know,\ntheir hearts labor and fret,\ntheir hearts labor and fret—\nthe illness is already severe,\nfor they deceive themselves as clever,\nyet only drain their vital *qi*.\n\nOnly when one regards forced knowing as the true illness,\ndoes one then cure the illness they have recognized.\n\nThus, one exhausts principles to fulfill nature,\nrefines life to await Heaven’s timing.\nWise yet not using wisdom,\nintelligent yet appearing foolish—\nnaturally, their hearts are empty as water,\ntheir nature bright as ice,\na single luminous spirit,\nshining through the *Triśarā* (三千),\nwhy would they suffer from scheming or contrivance?\n\nTherefore, they do not fall ill.\n\nThe sage’s understanding of affairs and principles\npossesses innate foresight,\nutterly devoid of divination or guesswork.\nHence, while common folk fall ill,\nthe sage does not fall ill—\nfor they can recognize what they do not know,\nwhat they do not see clearly,\nand thus with wholehearted devotion,\nthey surrender to the mystery of life,\ntheir five senses aligned in truth,\nall gathered within the single aperture of the *玄关* (Mysterious Pass).\n\nWith time, their luminous spirit blazes forth,\nilluminating without remainder—\ntruly, wherever they are, it is fitting,\nand nothing they do is unadvantageous.\n\nBecause they recognize the ailment of knowing what they do not know,\nthey do not fall ill.\n\nThis speaks of knowing through insight—\nthe highest attainment;\nif knowing through feigned cleverness,\nit is indeed a grave misfortune.\n\nOnly when one regards forced knowing as the true misfortune,\ndoes one then have no misfortune.\n\nThe sage’s escape from misfortune\nlies in always treating this misfortune as misfortune,\nthus they have no misfortune.\n\nThe grand meaning is now clear;\nno need to elaborate further.»\n\n「Now let us further elucidate the subtleties of the **Dao/Way**:\n\nIn general, when practicing seated meditation (*dàzuò*), one must first cultivate **定** (meditative stability) within the **離宮** (Palace of Rebirth), achieving a single resonance before self-reflection and self-verification. If indeed it is found to be utterly empty and devoid of substance, then the mind is clarified and **性** (true nature) is seen.\n\nThus, I have often said: At the outset of still-sitting, this mind hangs suspended in the **太虚** (Great Emptiness). Only when the body and mind are settled, and **意** (intent) and **氣** (qi) are harmonized, does one gradually gather and return the mind to reflect upon its own **本宫** (Root Palace). When one arrives at the state of absolute emptiness, with nothing between the chest, then from this moment of awakening and illumination, the **十方三界** (Ten Directions and Three Realms) are nowhere that does not enter one’s awakened illumination.\n\nYet, **awakening-nature** neither arises nor perishes—it merely is, **了了自了** (clearly self-illuminating), **如如自如** (suchness self-so). Through this, one seeks the **玄** (Mysterious), and the source water becomes supremely pure, naturally becoming the foundation for my **結丹** (alchemical elixir).\n\nIn a flash, the **性光** (nature-light) spontaneously manifests. How does one perceive this? It is within the **恍恍惚惚** (dimly vague) state I previously demonstrated. Suddenly, upon awakening, movement occurs—this is the essential beginning of cultivating the Dao/Way. Yet, to gather **情** (passions) with **性** (nature), if one does not first uncover the true nature of **性**, and abruptly descends into the **水府** (Abode of Water) to seek the Mysterious, how can one possibly gather **情** when there is no **性**?\n\nFor indeed, there exists the **虛靈** (void-spirit) and **蓬勃** (vigorous) **機** (mechanism). Know that **離** is not of the mind—when one concentrates the ears on sound, the eyes on light, and restrains the senses from scent, taste, and touch, these are all affairs of the **神火** (spiritual fire), hence it is called **屬離** (attributed to Rebirth). **坎** is not **氣** (qi)—wherever **精氣** (essence-qi) resides, it is **屬坎** (attributed to Abyss). Even if one directs the spirit into the blood, and the fire into the water, the **氣機** (qi-mechanism) may not yet be activated—one must firmly grasp and pull, stirring the waves from the **海底** (ocean’s depths), ascending them into the **丹田** (Elixir Field). After prolonged refining, when the **火功** (fire cultivation) is sufficient, suddenly the **天機** (heavenly mechanism) is activated, causing the entire body to surge with vitality, from the ten fingers to the whole body, ceaselessly trembling. The body stands like a wall, the intent as cold as ashes. When the **丹田**’s **氣** grows warm, this is the **火** (fire) at its **不老不嫩** (neither too strong nor too weak) peak of coalescence. If this effect is not observed, one remains merely **微微** (slightly faint), and fire cannot be practiced. If one sees this state for long yet fails to ignite the fire, only then does one apply fire to the already dissipated **氣**—this is the **藥老無用** (elixir past its prime, useless).\n\nStudents must carefully discern this.\n\nHowever, when the **微陽** (subtle yang) first stirs, it may not immediately produce such vigorous **氣**—one need only settle the mind and ease the intent, harmonizing the breath, and may proceed with the **子午河車** (Child-Midday Elixir Circulation). For indeed, the human body possesses **形質** (form-substance) blood, which remains **污污渾渾** (filthy and turbid), a mass of stagnant blood, unless refined by the **神火** (spiritual fire). Only through the illumination of the spiritual fire does a single point of **真氣** (true qi) emerge from the blood.\n\nThis is what the **Buddha** spoke of: *“In this fivefold turbid and evil world, I cultivated and attained the fruit of the Dao/Way.”*\n\nAgain, the ancients said: *“To take treasure from the ghost’s nest, to seek lead beneath the black mountain”*—these are all but the **真氣** (true qi) extracted from turbid essence and decayed blood through the refining of spiritual fire. Once the **氣** (qi) moves, **陽** (yang) arises—one must then know that **子** (Child) advances the yang-light, while **午** (Midday) retreats the **陰符** (yin-symbol). The **卯酉沐浴** (Tiger-Dog Bathing) methods, when practiced, allow one to gather this **真陽** (true yang), making it circulate and flow internally to dispel the **陰私** (hidden yin) within the **臟腑** (zang-fu organs), and externally to attract the **天地靈陽** (heaven-earth’s numinous yang). With prolonged practice, the **氣質** (qi-nature) also transforms.\n\nThis method of **河車** (Elixir Circulation) holds boundless profundity. The ancients spoke of *“gas brightens, Child-Midday draws and adds”*—drawing refers to extracting **鉛** (lead) from the Abode of Water, and adding refers to supplementing **汞** (mercury) from the Palace of Rebirth. **汞** is the **靈液** (numinous fluid) within the heart, the **後天** (post-heaven) containing the **先天** (pre-heaven). From the **色身** (form-body), **渾精敗血** (turbid essence and decayed blood), the **神火** (spiritual fire) refines and produces this **甘露** (ambrosia)—this is **鉛** (lead), the **氣** (qi) within the blood. **氣** (Qi) is what the ancients called the **金** (gold) in water, a **先天** (pre-heaven) within **後天** (post-heaven); it can only solidify the **凡林** (mundane body), not generate the **法身** (Dharma-body).\n\nThis is the medicine produced by the **坎離交** (Abyss-Rebirth interaction), yet still insufficient for **神丹** (spiritual elixir). One must then gather **情** (passions) with **性** (nature), and return **性** to **性** (nature to nature), harmonizing **性情** (nature-passions) to refine together in the **坤爐** (Kun Furnace). Suddenly, the **真陽** (true yang) emerges, forming the **乾坤交** (Heaven-Earth interaction) to congeal the elixir—only then can one refine **神丹** (spiritual elixir) into the **真仙子** (true immortal embryo).\n\nIn summary, there is no other method of cultivation—only the **河車** (Elixir Circulation) turning. At the **初關** (First Pass), one must exert effort; at the **中關** (Middle Pass), the **河車** (Elixir Circulation) is activated by both **天人** (heaven and humanity); when one reaches the **上關** (Upper Pass), the **河車** (Elixir Circulation) is purely natural, without fail.\n\nAs for the **卯酉沐浴** (Tiger-Dog Bathing) methods, these are merely precautions for beginners lest their minds be troubled and the fire be stirred prematurely, causing their work to falter. When one reaches pure mastery, no methods are needed. It all depends on the student’s ability to **神而明之** (manifest and clarify the spirit).」\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear Authority**\n\nThe people do not fear authority—then true authority has arrived.\n\nDo not confine their dwelling, do not exhaust their life.\nOnly because they are not exhausted, they are not exhausted.\nThus, the Sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nloves himself but does not exalt himself.\nHence, he discards that and embraces this.\n\nWhat is called authority is the great framework of norms and teachings,\nthe most sacred principle of Heaven, which must not be violated.\nIf one knows to be cautious in solitude, even in bed and shadow,\nand fears Heaven’s authority in hidden deeds,\nthen naturally Heaven bestows pure blessings,\nand longevity extends without bound.\n\nThe *Classic of Poetry* says:\n*\"Fear Heaven’s authority,\nand in its time, you shall be preserved.\"*\n\nIf Heaven’s authority looms close at hand,\nyet one does not guard against it with vigilance and clarity,\ncausing moral order to collapse,\nand propriety and righteousness to vanish—\nthen conscience perishes,\nHeaven’s punishment is unrelenting,\nand calamity cannot be avoided,\nwhile life itself is imperiled.\n\nThis is why it is said:\n*The people do not fear authority—then true authority has arrived.*\n\nYet this arises because they do not know\nto take *ren* (benevolence) as their secure dwelling,\nbut abandon it without inhabiting it;\nto take *qi* (vital breath) as their life,\nbut discard it and bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nAlas! Those people, unfortunate,\nborn not in the ancient age,\nfear authority as *de* (virtue/power) and *wei* (awe),\nrevere clarity as *ming* (illumination) and *huai* (embrace)—\nthus, in ignorance and transgression,\nHeaven’s signs are ignored,\nand droughts, floods, plagues, and famines arise in succession.\n\nOnly the rulers above should guide them\nto dwell in the boundless realm of the world,\nso that their minds may roam in the harmonious expanse of *Taihe*,\nnot confining themselves in narrowness,\nnor daily courting ruin;\nshould lead them to draw upon the vast *he* (noble) *qi*,\nso that they may nourish themselves in the pure and empty Heaven,\nnot exhausting their life,\nnor inviting self-destruction.\n\nOnly by cherishing the principle of preserving life,\nsafeguarding Heaven’s innate goodness,\nand never growing weary or decaying—\nthen the *Classic of Poetry* says:\n*\"Revere Heaven’s wrath,\nand dare not trifle with it;\nrevere Heaven’s decrees,\nand dare not rush blindly.\"*\n\nHeaven observes their virtue,\ngranting them prosperity and flourishing,\ngranting them longevity and preservation—\ntruly, they share in the eternal duration of Heaven and Earth.\nThus, they are not exhausted.\n\nWho but the Sage can achieve this?\n\nThe ancient emperors, reverent and non-actional,\nexalted in great virtue,\nday by day, month by month,\ncleansing their hearts and purifying their thoughts,\npenetrating the mysteries of creation,\ndiscerning the original Heaven—\nonly knew themselves.\n\nAs for deeds, writings, and outward achievements,\nthe Sage utterly rejects them as means of self-display.\n\nMoreover, he remains ever-vigilant, morning and evening,\ncherishing the Dao and guarding his essence,\nnever straying from *ren* for a single breath—\nnone can surpass him in this.\n\nHis self-love is such that\neven what others hold in highest esteem—\nnames, positions, fame, and glory—\nthe Sage does not deem them worthy of pride.\n\nThough the Sage’s own self-awareness and self-love\nare what all people commonly know and cherish—\nyet common people, knowing them, must display them,\nloving them, must exalt them;\nwhile the Sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nloves himself but does not exalt himself.\n\nHe is cautious in solitude, yet does not flaunt himself before others;\nhe values preservation, yet does not boast before the world.\nHow can common people compare?\n\nIt is said: abandon desire, fulfill humanity, align with Heaven,\nthus transcending humanity to become Sage,\nseparating from the common to become divine,\nand attaining immortality of countless eons—\nall this arises from\nself-awareness of dwelling in boundless ease,\nself-love of eternal joy,\nuniting in this and not dividing from it,\nso that the people naturally turn to goodness without knowing why.\n\nApart from this, how could it be so?\n\nThis speaks of not confining one’s dwelling—\nthen one’s dwelling must be vast.\nNot exhausting one’s life—\nthen one’s life must endure.\n\nYet in the practice, the original spirit and the recognizing spirit\nmust be understood.\n\nWhen a person first receives *qi*,\nfrom the moment of parents’ union,\na single grain of millet forms—\nat this time, indistinct and indistinct,\nonly a cluster of *Taihe* qi,\nwith no trace of knowledge.\n\nYet it is supremely divine, supremely wondrous,\nexhausting all transformations,\ngiving rise to boundless affairs in the world—\nall from this single spark of sentient qi,\nfrom non-knowing to knowing,\nfrom non-action to action,\nall beginning here.\n\nAt this stage, Heaven and humanity share one principle,\nthings and self share one source,\nsubstance and function are complete,\nmanifest and subtle are unbroken—\nthus, it is called the *original spirit*.\n\nThis is what Heaven bestows.\n\nWhen the flesh-and-blood form is complete,\nten months in the womb fulfilled,\na cry, and the infant is born—\nthen the *recognizing spirit* begins to take shape.\n\nThe *original spirit* is the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nshared by all things, hidden within the void.\nOnce it enters the human body,\nit dwells concealed in the empty cavities within.\n\nThis is Heaven’s gift.\nThose who cultivate the Great Dao\ncannot seek it through emptiness or form.\n\nOnly by being utterly without knowledge,\nutterly without possession,\nsweeping away all dust and haze,\ndoes the inner truth reveal itself,\nand divine mystery arise.\n\nAs for the *recognizing spirit*,\nit is the ghostly essence of the human body,\nthe seed of countless rebirths,\nrequiring the completion of the five senses\nand the hundred bones—\nonly when descending into birth and taking form\ndoes the soul have a place to depend upon.\n\nThe ancients called this the *postnatal recognizing spirit*,\nfor it arises from having form and body.\n\nThis is the great distinction between the *original spirit*.\n\nYet after birth, the two spirits—original and recognizing—\nmerge into one.\nSometimes the *original spirit* acts,\nwhile the *recognizing spirit* retreats in obedience—\nthough the intentions of the postnatal self may stir,\nthey must emerge through *ren, yi, li, zhi*,\nmanifesting as joy, anger, sorrow, or delight,\nand the *recognizing spirit* transforms into the *original spirit*.\n\nSometimes the *recognizing spirit* dominates,\nwhile the *original spirit* hides unseen—\nthough the traces of *ren, yi, li, zhi* appear,\nthey all become private affection, private love,\nprivate hatred, private resentment,\nand the *original spirit* transforms into the *recognizing spirit*.\n\nThus, all that arises from the body and senses—mouth and ears—is the *recognizing spirit*.\nWhen the *recognizing spirit* dominates,\nwhere is the radiant clarity, the upright and just,\ncapable of aligning with Heaven and Earth,\nquestioning the spirits and deities?\n\nOnly in the boundless chaos,\ndoes the spirit stir at a single sensation—\nhere, Heavenly Principle is pure and complete,\nuntainted by postnatal *recognizing spirit* and perception.\nIf one can firmly stand in this state,\nproceeding with steadfast resolve,\nthen one acts purely in accordance with Heavenly Principle,\nwithout the slightest trace of human desire’s private influence.\n\nThus, I instruct people:\nwhen in a state of no knowing, no awareness,\nto seek the *play of the mysterious* at the Pass.\nFor at this moment,\none is unified with Heaven and Earth,\nharmonious with the void and space.\n\nIf one can grasp this from the outset,\nthen Heaven and Earth’s eternal generation\nwill not be difficult to manifest within oneself;\nthe void’s transformations\nwill not be difficult to embody as spirit.\nAt this moment, when one awakens,\ntruly, it is the root of Heaven, Earth, and humankind.\n\nIf practitioners do not begin here,\nthen from where shall they ascend to the stages of Immortal and Sage?\n\nIn essence,\nthat which emerges without thought or deliberation is the *original spirit*;\nthat which arises with purpose, perception, and from the colored body is the *recognizing spirit*.\nThe *original spirit* is formless,\nthe *recognizing spirit* leaves traces.\nOne comes from emptiness,\nthe other issues from the colored body—\nthese two are vastly dissimilar.\n\nHaving understood that the *original spirit* is born from emptiness,\nand the *recognizing spirit* from the colored body,\nI thus rectify the root and clear the source,\nstriving to close the inner and outer *Three Treasures*,\nnot permitting a single thought or perception\nto arise from form, image, thought, or deliberation.\n\nThrough such cultivation and such nurturing,\nover time, even the vital essence of the corpse-like body\nwill transmute into pure and serene *original spirit*,\nand the eighty-four thousand hairs\nwill become protective spirits of the *Dharma*.\n\nThis is called\n*transforming the recognizing spirit into the original spirit*,\n*converting the yin into yang*—\nthis is achieved by firmly grounding oneself in emptiness,\nnot allowing the colored body’s perceptions to entangle the mind.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 73: Not Summoning Yet It Comes**\n*\"The bold are slain; the bold in restraint are saved.\"*\nThese two paths bring either gain or harm.\nWhat Heaven detests, who can fathom its reason?\nThus, even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven\nis victorious without strife,\nresponds without speaking,\ncomes without being summoned,\nand yet its schemes are ever-good.\nThe Heavenly net is vast and sweeping,\ncoursed yet never failing.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"The Heavenly mandate—\nmysterious and ceaseless.\"*\n\nHe who steals the *qi* of Heaven and Earth to make elixir,\nsteals from the mysterious and ceaseless Heavenly mandate.\n\nThis mandate, in Heaven, is the pure and serene *qi*;\nin humankind, it is the *Great Harmony qi*.\nOnly through nurturing from dawn’s first light,\nuntil the *boundless and overflowing qi* fills the two great voids,\ndoes one return to the root and recover the mandate,\nflowing above and below with Heaven and Earth alike.\n\nWhat is this nurturing?\nFirst, in the *death of false thoughts*—\nthe *death of false thoughts* values firmness;\nfirmness does not bend to external things,\nthus allowing *upright qi* to persist.\nSecond, in the *life of true Principle*—\nthe *life of true Principle* values gentleness;\ngentleness pleases all hearts,\nthus allowing *boundless qi* to solidify.\n\nThese two—\none pressing forward without hesitation, resolute in daring,\nis the *death-mind*;\none hesitating and faltering, willingly yielding to weakness,\nis the *life-qi*.\n\nThe bold in daring are slain;\nthe bold in restraint are saved—\nthis is the foundation of advance and retreat,\nthe root of failure and triumph.\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"At high noon, the sun declines;\nwhen the moon is full, it wanes.\"*\n\nHeaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness\nfollow the rhythms of time,\nsometimes bringing gain, sometimes harm,\noften contrary to the world’s expectations.\n\nThus, what humankind rejoices in,\nHeaven may detest.\n\nBut what does Heaven truly detest?\nThe *Heavenly Sovereign’s* love for life—\nsometimes it does not foster life but brings death;\nthe *Highest Sovereign’s* reverence for *virtue*—\nsometimes it does not reward *virtue* but metes out punishment.\n\nThis is life within death,\ndeath within life—\nits meaning profound and subtle,\nbeyond what humankind can measure.\n\nWhat Heaven detests, who can know its reason?\nThus, the Sage who cultivates the Dao\nknows that *blessing* is the foundation of *calamity*,\nthat *gentleness* is the essence of *firmness*,\nand balances *experience* and *authority* in their use,\nforgetting gain and dulling ambition,\nto uphold what is right,\nnot contending with the common for profit or harm,\nbut discerning within oneself what aligns or opposes.\n\nAs for disasters and blessings,\nbestowing fortune or misfortune,\neven the Sage struggles to perceive their subtleties,\nlet alone those below them.\n\nFor the Dao of the Sage\nis also the Dao of Heaven.\nThe Sage follows nature purely,\nwhile advance, retreat, ascent, and descent\nturn within the body’s transformations.\nHeaven’s Dao is effortless and natural,\nwhile life, growth, contraction, and storage\nflow ceaselessly through the *Great Void’s* expanse—\nthus it does not contend with all things for strength,\nyet its influence is ever-present,\nso that even the most skilled cannot resist it—\nthis is victory without strife.\n\nIt does not speak of Principle to the common folk,\nyet its disasters and blessings reach everywhere,\nno place escaping—\nthis is response without speaking.\n\nThough its effects may vary in swiftness or weight,\nin darkness, there is an unseen balance,\na measure beyond mortal scheming.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Not summoned yet it comes,\nspontaneous yet its schemes are ever-good.\"*\n\nEven if one’s talent and cunning surpass others,\nand one’s insight pierces the depths,\nthough one may fluster and conceal—\nwhat use is it?\n*\"The Heavenly net is vast and sweeping,\ncoursed yet never failing.\"*\nTruly, this is not false.\n\nTo suppress desire is to value daring;\nwithout daring, the human heart runs wild,\nhuman desire clings endlessly—\nthus the bold in daring are slain—\nthis is the *death of the recognizing spirit*.\nTo preserve Principle is to value gentleness;\nwithout gentleness, ordinary *qi* becomes violent,\nthe *original spirit* unsettled—\nthus the bold in restraint are saved—\nthis is the *life of the original spirit*.\n\nYet the *death of the false heart* aids the *life of the true*—\nthe human heart is easily extinguished,\nthe Dao-heart easily kindled.\nBut within, there is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nHeaven has its affections and aversions,\npunishment and virtue applied in tandem,\nlife and death employed together.\nThough some may grasp this,\nthey fail to perceive how life thrives within death’s mechanism,\nor how vitality lurks within mortality’s grasp—\nthe world struggles to fathom this.\n\nWho can fathom Heaven’s aversions?\nThe Sage aligns their heart with Heaven and Earth,\nknowing that what Heaven abhors is precisely what it cherishes—\nfor without aversion, there could be no true affection.\nThis cyclical marvel, even the Sage finds hard to grasp.\nYet the Sage’s Way is none other than Heaven’s Way.\n\nHeaven does not contend with the common folk over right and wrong,\nyet nurtures all things—none escape its warmth and care,\nnor transgress and stray.\nIt does not speak of trust and response,\nyet yin and yang alternate in perfect accord—\nnone fail to harmonize, nor transgress and stray.\nTruly, Heaven and humanity share the same Way:\nstill and unmoving, yet responsive and unified—\nhow wondrous its transformation!\nAll things and I share the same source,\nboundless and impartial—\nwhen things come, they are met with fitting response—\nhow could action be otherwise?\n\nThe Perfect One, with their unthinking, unburdened truth,\nsilently works divine power in the realm of life and death,\nstealthily seizing Heaven’s intent within the palace of creation.\nThey enter the Watery Realm, forge the Golden Country,\nfollow the Venerable One, severing sight and sound.\nTo them, death is life, life is death—\nthey know not how victory and response intertwine,\nlike parent and child, husband and wife—\nunsummoned yet arriving, unplanned yet harmonized.\nIs this not the swiftest trust and response, the most divine?\n\nAs for calamities and blessings, rewards and punishments,\nfortune and misfortune, the Heavenly net is vast and sweeping—\nnone escape its threads.\nFor emptiness is the Dao, the Dao is Heaven—\none cannot escape emptiness, nor the Heavenly net.\nTo not defy the Dao is to not defy Heaven—\nhow could Heaven’s rest be otherwise?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Four: The People Do Not Fear Death**\nIf the people do not fear death,\nhow can you frighten them with death?\nIf I could make the people always fear death as something extraordinary,\nI could seize and execute them—who would dare?\nBut there are always those charged with execution who carry it out.\nTo substitute for those who execute is like substituting for the Master Carpenter.\nHe who substitutes for the Master Carpenter—\nhow few escape uninjured?\n\nAncient rulers who governed the world\nmust follow what easily moves the people’s emotions\nand preemptively guard against it.\nThey do not follow the ruler’s joys and sorrows,\nbut observe the people’s affections and aversions,\nguiding them by their natural inclinations for their benefit—\nthus their teachings succeed without rigidity,\ntheir governance thrives without excess.\n\nIf the people destroy propriety and family bonds,\ntransgressing norms and rank,\nyet show no fear of death,\nthen my establishment of the Five Punishments,\ndisplayed on the ceremonial grounds,\ndeclared on auspicious days—\nthis is but wasted effort,\noffering no benefit to the state or its people.\nIs this not a waste of effort?\n\nOnly by leveraging the people’s love of life and fear of death\ncan I punish those who dare commit wickedness and deceit—\nthis is to strike one to warn a hundred,\nto deter few while inspiring many to sincerity.\nThus the people themselves—\nfathers admonish their sons,\nelders encourage their younger brothers—\nnone dare act as a stepping-stone to chaos,\nrisking life to court death.\n\nYet execution rests with those above,\nbut the reason for killing lies in the nature of the offender.\nOnly the supremely virtuous may execute the supremely unvirtuous—\nthen the people themselves execute without resentment,\nand die with acceptance.\n\nMencius said, *“Only Heaven’s officers may be executed.”*\nIf Heaven’s officers may be killed,\nthen there are always those charged with execution.\nBut if it is not Heaven’s officer and yet the violent are punished with violence,\nthis is to govern disorder with disorder—\nnot only does the people’s chaos worsen,\nbut substituting for those who execute is like\na substitute craftsman wielding the axe to shape the wheel—\nhow could they rival the Master’s skill and perfection?\n\nExamining artisans past and present,\nnone can match the Master’s craft—\nyet those who substitute for the Master Carpenter,\nhow many escape unharmed?\nAlas, the people are unfortunate—\nnot born in an age of virtue,\nso bandits and criminals act without restraint.\nEven more unfortunate, they encounter no executioners—\nno guidance or awakening is possible,\nand so the thin grow thinner,\nwhile even the virtuous become thin.\nIs this not deeply lamentable?\n\n「To liken caution in solitude to the fear of death,\none must know that if a person is diligent in self-cultivation,\nthen the distinction between Heaven and humanity becomes clear,\nand the division between principle and desire is manifest.\n\nWhen desires are few but fail to be fully restrained,\nand one strives to avoid transgressions yet cannot—\nhere, with constant vigilance and earnest striving,\nreflecting on even the subtlest inclinations,\nand curbing the false and deceptive,\nit is not difficult to achieve purity of principle and clarity of mind,\nand instantly reveal the original face of things.\n\nBut in places where no one observes or hears,\nand where there is no daily practice of moral cultivation or self-restraint,\nwhen desires surge and emotions overwhelm,\nthinking to uproot evil and eradicate sin,\nand suddenly perceiving the true nature—\nthe result must be that evil is not uprooted but multiplies,\nand the more one strives to purify the heart, the more it becomes disordered.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* says: *\"The people do not fear death—how can you frighten them with death?\"*\nThe principle and its effect are thus interdependent—\nonly by being cautious in solitude can one truly know the falsity of desires.\nThen, when desires arise in the moment,\none can restrain them with resolve,\nand thus return to the rectitude of Heaven’s heart.\n\nWhen one thought is swept away,\nand another remains pure,\nevil will not spontaneously regenerate at that juncture.\n\nAs for the people who habitually fear death,\nthose who dare to transgress or disrespect\nand corrupt the norms of propriety,\nI shall seize and execute them—who will dare?\nFor the Daoist drives out the non-Daoist,\njust as a benevolent ruler soothes the masses,\ngoverns the common folk,\nand with utmost compassion restrains the most uncompassionate,\nwith supreme justice punishes the unjust—\nnaturally, none who submit will remain secure,\nwhile the near ones are content and the distant ones come,\npreventing the rise of rebellions or counterattacks,\nnor turning into enemies or causing harm.\n\nA scholar who seeks to discard falsehood and preserve sincerity,\nto return to the root and reflect on the origin,\nmust do so gradually and steadfastly,\nuntil one insight opens and all faculties become responsive,\nand the original spirit is at peace, obeying the commands of the mind.\n\nAs it is said, *\"If a person can remain constantly pure,\nthen all of Heaven and Earth shall be his domain.\"*\nAnd again: *\"If a person can rectify his spirit,\nthen all evils will not dare to approach.\"*\n\nThis is akin to the executioner’s punishment—\nno resentment when he kills,\nno unease when one dies—\nthe same natural Dao, the same rare effect.\n\n**Chapter 75: The Sage Values Life Less Than Nobility**\nThe people’s hunger arises from their rulers’ excessive tax consumption,\nthus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in governance stems from their rulers’ interference,\nthus they are hard to govern.\nThe people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ extravagant pursuit of life,\nthus they hold life lightly.\n\nOnly those who do not prioritize life itself\nare truly wiser than those who revere it.\n\nFrom ancient times, the people have been the foundation of the state,\nand food is their Heaven.\nA state without people—who shall support it?\nPeople without food—how shall they live?\n\nThus, for those in power,\nthere must be diligence in opening fields and cultivating land,\ndeepening the roots before the people have eaten;\nestablishing rites and moderating changes,\nregulating the flow after the people have eaten;\nand further, reducing labor to make up for shortages,\nand curtailing expenditures to aid those in need—\nso the people themselves provide ample sustenance,\nand there are no laments of scarcity or hunger.\nEven if drought strikes and famine follows,\nif the granaries are stocked,\nworries of calamity vanish.\n\nBut in the world today,\nrulers indulge in arrogance and licentiousness,\ntheir wasteful spending ever increasing:\nsome seek rare delights and curiosities for amusement,\nothers build palaces of jade and pavilions of precious stones to satisfy their desires.\nOften, the granaries are emptied,\nyet their expenditures do not diminish.\nEven basic provisions are lacking,\nand they impose heavier burdens:\nfirst, they add extra taxes and levies,\nstill fearing the people’s resistance;\nthen, they seize ruthlessly and demand excessively,\neven disregarding Heaven’s will.\nTheir love of music and beauty is paramount,\nluxury and extravagance reach their height.\nThey drain the vital essence of the people,\nwhile indulging their own debauchery.\nWhen the state’s treasury is exhausted,\nyet their demands relentlessly continue—\nhow can one expect no hunger,\neven in years of abundant harvests and frequent blessings?\n\nIn the age of *Zhuó Lóng*,\nclothing was for all, food for all,\nhomes for all, fields for all—\neach cherished their kin,\neach honored their elders.\nThe virtuous did not need to be taught rites and propriety,\nfor they naturally resided in benevolence and followed righteousness;\nthe common folk did not require lessons in loyalty and sincerity,\nfor they found contentment in their work and peace in their homes.\nThe ruler’s conduct itself was the governance,\nwhile the people transformed themselves effortlessly.\nCustoms were pure without intent,\nmanners ancient without seeking them—\nhow flourishing and harmonious was that era!\n\nBut later,\nas laws and regulations multiplied,\ncustoms grew ever more corrupt;\nthe more decrees were proclaimed,\nthe more thieves and bandits thrived.\nEven in tyrannical rulers, this is expected,\nbut even wise and enlightened kings,\nwho strive with vigor and exert themselves in governance,\nfind that the more complex their policies become,\nthe more falsehoods arise,\nand the stricter their laws,\nthe more deceitful schemes emerge.\nIs this not because the *qi* and its influence are hard to reverse,\nnor because Heaven’s will is unchangeable?\nOr is it because they fail to grasp the root and foundation,\nand instead seek remedies in superficial measures?\nNot only does this fail to benefit the people,\nit also burdens the Way of the world.\n\nThe people’s hearts are inherently without strife,\nyet their rulers disturb them with policies;\nthe people’s emotions are naturally without desire,\nyet their rulers disrupt them with rigid codes.\nFor every additional decree from the court,\nthe common folk devise a hundred more deceits;\nfor every new regulation,\nthe people invent a hundred more clever evasions.\nNo wonder the world’s ways are so corrupt,\nthe people’s hearts shift daily,\nand governance becomes ever more difficult.\n\nOnly when the ruler sits upright and relaxed,\ndoes the people below naturally settle into order and obedience.\nAbove and below live in harmony under the natural governance of Heaven—\nis this not joyful?\n\nMoreover,\nthe more one seeks to preserve life,\nthe heavier the burden on the mind grows,\nand the greater the depletion of vital *qi*.\nAs the spirit and *qi* dissipate,\nlife itself is extinguished—\nthe more one clings to life, the sooner death comes.\nThus, the more extravagant the pursuit of life,\nthe more lightly death is held.\n\nOnly those who do not regard life as an honor,\nnor place excessive weight on preserving it,\nwho take food and clothing as they come,\nand do not compete with others in their expenditures,\nwill find peace of mind and bodily ease,\ntheir true nature restored and life prolonged,\nand enjoy eternal, boundless blessings.»\n\nNurturing the *Taihe* within,\none naturally invites Heaven’s favor—\nhow much more excellent than those who prize artificial contrivance\nby a millionfold measure?\n\nThe spirit is the sovereign; the people, the vital *qi*.\nFollowing the constant Dao,\ntaking the spirit as master,\nwhile the *qi* moves in accordance.\n\nThus, when the spirit strays,\nthe *qi* immediately dissipates.\nThe depletion of *qi*\narises from the spirit’s unrest—\njust as the people’s hunger\ncomes from excessive taxation above.\nThough their forms differ,\ntheir principle is one.\n\nThe heart is sovereign over the body;\nwhen the Heavenly Lord is serene,\nall limbs obey his command.\nBut if the Heavenly Lord is disturbed,\nthen the body’s *qi* is exhausted—\nhow much more so when the fields are laid waste?\n\nThus, the Dao of immortals lies in returning to the original,\ntaking *qi* as master,\nwhile the spirit follows its command—\njust as a ruler yields to desires and follows the people’s will,\nso that *qi* is full and the spirit complete,\nand the people at peace, the state flourishing.\n\nThis is the way of the superior serving the inferior,\nof the above having surplus to supplement the below’s lack—\ntreating the world as oneself, not oneself as the world.\n\nThough the Dao of the Elixir speaks of *action*,\nit must arise from *non-action* to *action*,\nand *action* return to *non-action*—\nonly then does one grasp the primordial *qi* of Heaven,\nable to transcend humanity and attain sainthood.\n\nIf one relies solely on contrivance,\nthe spirit will not be still, nor the *qi* strong.\nNecessarily, refining will fail to gather *qi*,\nthe more one refines, the more scattered the *qi* becomes.\n\nOnly by following its natural course and guiding it appropriately,\nadapting measures to the time,\nwhether cultivating oneself or governing the people,\nmust one hold this view.\n\nIf one fears poverty and death,\nexhausting the spirit and *qi* in pursuit of a finite, later-born life,\nnight and day in torment,\nsleep and wakefulness in distress—\nhow much the spirit and *qi* are wasted!\n\nMoreover, life is Heaven’s decree,\nnot something one can claim.\nThe ruler fears that those who cling to life\nwill only hasten their own demise.\nOnly by not valuing this limited, later-born life,\nand instead preserving the boundless, primordial essence,\ncan one safeguard the true nature and secure life—\nthen the body itself becomes precious.\n\n---\n**Chapter 76: The Soft and Weak Hold High Ground**\nThe complete person is soft and weak in life,\nbut rigid and strong in death.\nGrasses and trees, in life, are tender and fragile,\nbut in death, withered and brittle.\nThus, the rigid and strong are companions of death,\nwhile the soft and weak are companions of life.\n\nTherefore, the strong in arms do not conquer,\nthe rigid in wood cannot bend.\nThe strong and great must yield to the lowly,\nwhile the soft and weak ascend above.\n\nWhen a person receives the warm *yang* *qi*, they live;\nwhen they receive the cold *yin* *qi*, they die.\nWhen the warm *yang* *qi* gathers,\nthe four limbs grow supple,\nthe body soft and pliant,\nand life’s vitality never ceases.\nBut when cold *yin* *qi* congeals,\nthe flesh dries and withers,\nthe skin and fur crack and fall away,\nand death’s *qi* approaches.\n\nObserve the pot and steamer—\nwhen steaming, the *yang* *qi* rises thickly,\nand things dissolve and transform.\nBut in freezing weather,\nthings grow cold and hard.\n\nObserve the earth in spring and summer—\nwhen *yang* *qi* is fierce, all things flourish and grow,\nnone failing to thrive.\nBut when autumn and winter meet,\n*yin* *qi* prevails, and all things wither and fall.\n\nHuman and thing share the same source,\nwith no distinction between them.\nThus, all things under Heaven,\nwhether great or small,\nare companions of death in their rigidity,\nand companions of life in their softness.\n\nConsider warfare—\noften the strong are defeated,\nwhile the weak prevail—\nas when Ziyu’s overrigidity led to defeat,\nand Bibi’s yielding won victory over Chu.\nWhy is this?\nBecause the strong decline gradually,\nwhile the weak hold the seeds of rise—\nthus, they cannot prevail.\n\nObserve the trees—\nwood is most rigid,\nyet when *yin* *qi* is strong and *yang* *qi* weak,\nit is bound and broken,\nwith no way to nourish itself.\n\nThe strong and great exhaust their life *qi*,\nwhile death’s *qi* approaches—\ntruly, the lowest of things.\nThe soft and weak dissolve *yin* and strengthen *yang*,\nbecoming the highest of things.\n\nHow can one not embrace weakness and reject strength,\nnot yield to the lowly and ascend above?\n\nThe Dao of cultivation most emphasizes the *Xuan Guan* orifice,\nthe origin of Heaven, earth, and all things’ life-giving *qi*.\nThis *qi* is supremely soft yet firm,\nsupremely weak yet strong—\nyet neither soft nor hard, neither weak nor strong is seen.\nIn the hazy, distant void,\nsuddenly, *yin* contains *yang*,\ndeath gives birth to life—\nseemingly present, yet absent;\nseemingly real, yet empty—\nthis is the true, scentless, soundless,\nHeaven’s initial mechanism.\n\nIf one can steal this primordial, void-beginning *qi*,\nthen the origin of Heaven’s life-giving essence is obtained,\nand attaining immortality is no difficulty.\n\nEven if one steals the *Xuan Guan* origin-*qi*\nas the Elixir’s treasure,\nyet in the four seasons of gathering medicine,\none must focus *qi* to achieve softness—\nlike an infant, bones soft and body weak yet grasp firm—\nonly then does one obtain the initial *qi* as the Elixir’s foundation.\n\nIn the four seasons of refining fire,\none must know the body’s softness, like cotton,\nunmatched in comfort—\nthis is the primordial, unspun, blooming vitality,\nthe symbol of harmonious, lively *qi*.\nWith this *yang* *qi*, one can refine the Elixir.\n\nAt the stage of returning to the cauldron and sealing,\nstill one must be softly persistent,\nclearly aware,\nneither slack nor reckless—\nlike drunkenness, like madness,\nthe spirit lazy in thought,\nthe mouth lazy in speech—\nas the saying goes:\n*\"Under Heaven, spring clouds are as lazy as I—\nwho knows I am even lazier than spring?\"*\n\nOnly such softness and weakness\npreserve the primordial *yang* *qi*,\nable to endure without decay.\n\nIn summary,\nten months in the womb,\nthree years at the breast,\nnine years of seclusion—\nall are the primordial soft and weak *qi*,\nwhich completes the Elixir and achieves immortality.\n\nThe cultivator must seek this tender *qi*,\nlest they burn and refine in vain,\nwasting their spirit and *qi*.\n\n---\n**Chapter 77: Acting Without Relying**\n\n**Chapter 78: Receiving the Realm’s Filth**\n\nThe Way of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high it depresses, the low it raises;\nThe excessive it diminishes, the deficient it supplements.\nThe Way of Heaven supplements the deficient and diminishes the excessive,\nBut the Way of Man is otherwise—\nIt diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho then can serve the world with their excess?\nOnly the Sage of the Way.\n\nThus the Sage acts without relying,\nAchieves without dwelling—\nDoes he not wish to be seen as virtuous?\nThe Way of Heaven flows and nourishes all things,\nThrough ceaseless interplay of yin and yang,\nForward and backward, alternating without end—\nGreat, central, and perfectly just,\nNeither partial nor biased.\nHence, when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises;\nWhen yang reaches its extreme, yin arises.\nIf yin is excessive and yang is weak,\nThen yin is suppressed and yang is bolstered;\nIf yang is excessive and yin is weak,\nThen yang is suppressed and yin is bolstered.\nEbb and flow, swelling and waning,\nMove in harmony with the seasons,\nThus life and transformation unfold,\nAchieving effortless spontaneity,\nAn eternal, unexhausted Heaven.\nWhat differs from one who draws a bow?\nWith bow held firm and intent upright,\nThe body straight, the front and rear arms aligned—\nThe high is depressed, the low is raised,\nThe excessive is diminished, the deficient is supplemented.\nThen, following the natural motion,\nThe arrow finds its mark without fail.\nHow unlike the Way of Heaven’s natural course—\nTaking the people’s fat and marrow,\nFilling their bellies,\nYet often diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho then can use the ruler’s excess\nTo supplement the people’s deficiency?\nOnly the Sage of the Way,\nWho follows the Way of Heaven and aligns with human nature,\nDiminishing where diminished, supplementing where supplemented,\nSo that the common folk have no cause for grievance.\nThough acting for oneself,\nIt is still in accordance with the Way of Heaven—\nNever boasting of one’s deeds;\nThough achieving, it is only sincerity—\nNever claiming credit for one’s work.\nSuch a person,\nTruly aligns with Heaven’s effortless transformation,\nNot forcing the natural course,\nNot desiring to be seen in action.\nThe glory of creation shines upon all—\nIs it not because the virtuous do not seek to be seen as virtuous?\nThis is why Heaven has no limits,\nAnd only the Sage unites Heaven and Earth.\n\nAt birth, man is pure yin and pure yang,\nPerfectly balanced, neither superior nor inferior.\nThus, day by day, month by month,\nHis bones grow soft, his body weak yet thrives.\nAfter life begins,\nFire dwells above, water below—\nWater and fire do not intermingle,\nSo yin is always excessive, yang always deficient.\nWhen yang-water is scorched by yin-fire,\nThe human heart grows ever more restless,\nWorldly passions burn brighter,\nWhile the true heart fades daily,\nTrue *qi* dwindles away—\nThe vital principle of life is lost.\nIf the excessive yin-fire supplements the deficient yang-water,\nAnd after supplementing yang-water,\nStill restrains the excessive yin-fire—\nLike one drawing a bow,\nDiminishing the excessive, supplementing the deficient—\nThen yin and yang are restored.\nThis is all the natural movement of water and fire,\nThe natural interplay of yin and yang,\nAnd Heaven knows not of their doing.\nThe Way of Man is burdened by action,\nThe Way of Heaven is honored by non-action.\nWhat else is cultivation but\nReturning post-Heaven yin and yang\nTo pre-Heaven yin and yang,\nFlowing endlessly in effortless spontaneity?\n\n**Chapter 79: Receiving the Realm’s Filth**\nThe world has nothing softer or weaker than water,\nYet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the hard and strong.\nThere is no substitute for it.\nThus, the weak overcomes the strong,\nThe soft overcomes the hard—\nAll know this, yet none can practice it.\nTherefore the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the realm’s filth is to be its sovereign.\nTo bear the realm’s misfortunes is to be its king.\"*\nThis is contrary speech.\n\nThe *Taishang* chapter before spoke of the soft and weak as the source of life,\nAnd the hard and strong as the source of death.\nThus, the soft and weak occupy the high,\nThe hard and strong occupy the low—\nIt is clear that the utmost softness is the utmost strength,\nThe utmost weakness is the utmost power.\nOne must practice day and night,\nEver choosing the soft and weak as beneficial to all,\nAlways dwelling in the low and filthy without aversion.\nThough but a drop, men may scorn it.\nThough but a ladleful, men may despise it.\nYet when it accumulates into a deep pool,\nGathers into an ocean,\nIt becomes vast and boundless—\nIt can bear ships and also capsize them;\nIt can nurture life and also destroy it.\nNot only does the world have no equal,\nBut even those skilled at overcoming the hard and strong\nCannot break what is firm, cannot shatter what is strong,\nAnd none can resist it.\nThus, the world’s utmost softness\nCan govern the world’s utmost hardness;\nThe world’s utmost weakness\nCan drive the world’s utmost strength.\nWater, water!\nHow soft and weak it is,\nYet how hard and strong it becomes!\n\nMoreover, there is no task easier than attacking water,\nYet the hard and strong cannot conquer it.\nWhy then do men not embrace softness and reject hardness,\nNot choose weakness and reject strength?\nIs it not because, though they know the soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong,\nTheir innate virtue, once stirred,\nIs immediately stained by desire and habit,\nSo they bristle with arrogance,\nUnwilling to rest in softness and weakness.\nThus, cleverness grows while principle fades,\nPartiality thrives while true nature is lost.\nThe result is that the moral heart departs,\nThe human heart arises;\nForeign *qi* flourishes, true *qi* wanes.\nLife’s foundation is gone, its vitality extinguished—\nHow could one then hope for ceaseless generation?\nThe Sage says, *\"To bear the realm’s filth is to be its sovereign,\"*\nAs did King Tang: *\"If I have guilt, it lies not with the myriad lands;\nIf the myriad lands have guilt, it lies with me.\"*\n\n「To retreat is to advance—\nThus one receives the Heavenly Mandate from the boundless.\n\n*\"To bear the realm’s ill fortune is to rule the world.\"*\nAs did King Wu: *\"I have conquered you, not because my father, King Wen, was guilty,\nBut because I, your humble subject, was unvirtuous.\"*\n\nTo later is to be prior—\nThus one bears Heaven’s grace without replacement.\n\nHow could it compare with later ages’ *bed of thorns and tasting gall*,\nOr those who endure filth and accept slander?\nThis is the eternal, unchanging principle,\nAn immutable scripture through the ages—\nThe true words of the world,\nYet the Sage only turns inward to seek within oneself,\nNever demanding this of others.\n\nWater is a metaphor for the initial movement of *yang*—\nThe true essence begins to form.\nIts mechanism is most weak,\nIts force most soft.\nYet gradually it gathers and solidifies,\nDay by day, month by month,\nUntil it becomes the vast and boundless *qi*,\nMost great and most hard,\nFilling the two extremes,\nUnifying all things—\nYet nothing is too firm for it not to penetrate,\nNothing is too strong for it not to overcome.\n\n*The Awakening to Truth* says:\n*\"The White Tiger’s first scripture is a priceless treasure,\nThe Godly Pool’s true scripture of essence.\nThe highest excellence is like water, benefiting its source deeply—\nNot comparable to ordinary elixirs.\"*\n\nObserve how *qi*’s softness and weakness resemble water:\nMost soft yet containing inherent hardness,\nMost weak yet encompassing utmost strength—\nTruly possessing the power to prop up the heavens and support the earth,\nTo cradle the sun and raise the moon,\nTo summon wind and call rain,\nTo drive thunder and wield lightning.\nThis is the world’s ultimate firmness and strength.\n\nThough called *vast qi*,\nIts essence is the true elixir.\nOne must nurture it with utmost softness and weakness,\nAnd act with *wuwei* as the method,\nAchieve *wuwei* as the function—\nOnly then may one attain it.\n\nWhat is meant by *\"To bear the realm’s filth is to be its sovereign,\nTo bear the realm’s ill fortune is to rule the world\"*?\nIt is the ancient practice of self-reproach,\nOf declaring, *\"Truly, I am unvirtuous—\nWhat wrong have the people committed?\"*\n\nIf scholars seek virtue in others,\nWhy not first cultivate it within oneself?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine: Always Do Good to Others**\n*\"To reconcile great grievances will surely leave lingering grievances—\nHow then can it be called virtue?\"*\nThus the Sage holds the left contract,\nYet does not blame others.\nTherefore, the virtuous govern contracts,\nThe unvirtuous govern disputes.\nHeaven’s Dao has no favorites,\nYet always favors the virtuous.\nThe way of cultivating oneself,\nIs to cherish virtue as its treasure.\nThe way of doing virtue,\nIs to first govern oneself.\nFor the Dao resides within,\nNot without;\nCultivation lies in oneself,\nNot in others.\nOnly by observing inwardly at all times,\nAnd reflecting back upon oneself at every moment—\nTo correct faults and reinforce virtues—\nMay one truly clarify virtue within oneself,\nAnd forever be the worthy child of Heaven and Earth,\nThe complete Sage and Saint,\nWithout any deficiency.\n\nIt is clear that those who do virtue\nOnly question their own cultivation and reflection,\nNot others’ compliance or defiance.\nIf one blames others yet does not blame oneself,\nObserves only outward appearances and not inward truth—\nThough one may momentarily disperse anger,\nAnd not reach the point of enmity,\nYet without the method of inward self-reproach,\nOr the practice of restraining anger and purifying desire,\nEven if one resolves conflicts externally,\nOne cannot release them from the unseen depths—\nHow could one then remain pure and dust-free,\nFree and joyful in oneself,\nAnd return to the original virtue of Heaven and Earth?\n\nThus, *\"To reconcile great grievances will surely leave lingering grievances—\nHow then can it be called virtue?\"*\n\nOnly the Sage governs the self and interacts with others,\nIn dealing with oneself and awaiting others,\nAlways prioritizing self-cultivation,\nAnd never concerning oneself with others’ judgments or preferences.\nLike sealing a contract,\nDividing left and right to hold it—\nForever relying on it,\nAnd making clear the intention:\n*\"No fear of you deceiving me,\nNo fear of I deceiving you.\"*\n\nThe Sage holds *virtue/power* as one holds the left contract,\nOnly cultivating within oneself and never blaming others—\nThis is why they align with Heaven and Earth in their greatness.\n\nThis is called *\"The virtuous govern contracts.\"*\nThe unvirtuous, however,\nPlace weight on the external and slight the internal,\nOften regard scrutiny as clarity,\nAnd must account for others’ enmities—\nThis is *\"The unvirtuous govern disputes.\"*\n\nThose who *\"govern disputes\"*,\nTake fault-finding as their task,\nNever reflect inwardly yet the people do not follow—\nHow can they compare with those who *\"govern contracts\"*,\nWho blame themselves heavily and others lightly,\nAnd thus all are trusting and faithful!\n\nIt is known that blaming others\nIs to slight oneself—\nOne’s own virtue cannot be complete;\nBlaming oneself\nIs to slight others—\nOne’s own virtue is truly achieved.\n\nIf one does good to others,\nHeaven’s favor will attend—\nFor endless ages without fail.\n\n*The Classic of Documents* says:\n*\"The August Heaven has no favorites,\nIt aids only virtue\"—\nIs this not the same as *The Supreme Dao*’s saying:\n*\"Heaven’s Dao has no favorites,\nYet always favors the virtuous?\"*\n\nThe Sage’s learning,\nIs to wash the heart and retreat into secrecy.\nRegarding outward virtues and vices,\nRight and wrong, compliance or defiance—\nAll are not considered.\nThus, one filters thoughts and sinks into reflection,\nConcentrates the spirit and silently observes,\nUntil the heart is clear and nature revealed,\nDesires purified and principles refined—\nAbove, aligning with Heaven in virtue,\nThrough endless ages without erosion.\n\nIts foundation begins with *guarding the center*,\nIts completion lies in *embryonic breathing*—\nDo you know of this within?\n\nThe ancients spoke of *embryonic breathing*—\nStudents must not mistake it for external breath or external *qi*.\nIt is when ordinary breath ceases,\nAnd the true *yin* and true *yang* of the *dantian*,\nThe original spirit and original *qi*,\nFuse into one cluster,\nMixing into one breath—\n*Yīnyīn yǔnyǔn* (vaporous and misty),\n*Péngpéng bó bó* (vigorous and flourishing),\nOpening and closing like gates,\nHaving and not having like a phantom.\nVisible yet unseen,\nAudible yet unheard—\nImagined yet with traces,\nFaintly perceived yet with form.\nThis is perhaps the original breath of life.\n\nThe heart attains it and has substance,\nThe nature attains it and has function—\nWithout this breath, one cannot live.\nTo become a Sage of the highest rank,\nOne cannot be without this breath as its master.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"At the beginning of life,\nThe foundation is *li* (principle), giving rise to breath,\nThe breath giving rise to form—\nThis is the natural sequence of Heaven and Earth in generating life.\"*\n\nReturning to reverse cultivation, one truly begins by slowly stirring the *yang* fire and *yin* talisman from the myriad forms and colors, drawing them back into the Five Bright Palaces. With the primordial *Taiyi* ancestral *qi* and the natural divine fire, one refines them—thus transforming form into a single breath.\n\nOnce this breath is refined into one, it can then be transmuted into spirit.\nIf one steadfastly guards the void and nurtures the numinous *yang*,\neven without returning to the primordial *Wuji*,\none may manifest form when exiting and leave no trace when entering.\nWhat difference does the Dao have from ordinary people?\n\nIn essence, this prenatal breath is none other than the moment when one returns to the state of *yin-yang* fusion—the original *qi* and blood of one’s parents’ union.\nIf one cultivates this prenatal breath,\nday and night with the true intent of *wuwei* (non-action) as *youwei* (action),\nand *wusi* (non-thought) as *yousi* (thought),\npreserving and gathering it,\nit will coalesce into a spiritual embryo and become the original spirit.\n\nWhen the ten months are complete and the form is whole,\nit sheds its shell and ascends through the crown,\npiercing the heavens and soaring to the celestial realm—\nriding the *luán* crane and the *hè* heron,\nsoaring among the clouds,\nwandering beyond the skies,\nand ascending to the Jade Capital—\nall in the blink of an eye.\n\nYet this prenatal breath,\nthough refined from the mortal’s colored body,\nis not the same as the vulgar *jing* and *qi* or the coarse spirit that forms it.\nThough alchemists cannot do without the postnatal, tangible *jing* and *qi* as their foundation,\nthey do not rely on them entirely.\nFor postnatal *jing* and *qi* are all substantial and bound by fate—\nsubject to birth and death, the wheel of rebirth is inevitable.\nMoreover, coarse *jing* and coarse *qi* are all dull and sluggish—\nhow could they possess any numinous essence?\nIt is only by subjecting these vulgar substances within the mortal form\nto countless refinements,\nextracting that pristine, dust-free, supremely numinous and divine *jing-qi-shén*,\nand returning it to oneself as the True One *qi*,\nthat one may forge the immortal embryo and spiritual elixir.\n\nWhat is called *\"extracting lead and adding mercury\"* is no more than this.\nAll else that clings to form and color is not the true Dao.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The embryo forms from the latent breath,\nand the breath rests within the embryo.\"*\nThus, to forge the spiritual elixir and achieve an ageless body,\none cannot do without nurturing the prenatal breath.\nTo have the prenatal breath condense within the void of the *dantian*,\none must first form the embryo—\notherwise, it will not return.\nIf even a trace of vulgar *qi* mingles in,\nor if the spirit wanders externally while the mortal mind strays,\nthe spirit will scatter and the *qi* will dissipate,\nunable to unite like parent and child, husband and wife,\ngathering without dispersing.\nDo you understand?\n\n---\n**Chapter Eighty: The Small State, the Few People**\nIn a small state with few people,\nlet there be implements of war numbering ten to a hundred,\nbut let them not be used.\nLet the people hold death in reverence\nand not wander far from home.\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nthey shall have no need to ride them.\nThough there are armor and weapons,\nthey shall have no place to display them.\nLet the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\nLet their food be simple,\ntheir clothing plain,\ntheir dwellings secure,\ntheir customs joyful.\nNeighboring states, though nearby,\nshall hear only the sounds of roosters and dogs—\nthe people shall not visit one another\nuntil they die of old age.\n\nA small state with few people,\nremote and sparsely populated,\nwould find it difficult to become a great and flourishing realm,\nor to uphold the refined customs of antiquity.\nYet if one reduces wasteful expenditures\nand simplifies elaborate rituals,\nso that implements of war numbering ten to a hundred\nare not used,\nthen consumption will be less while goods will be more—\nthe wealth of the state can thus be achieved.\nMoreover, if one does not indulge desires lightly,\nnor risk death for private gain,\nnor wander to distant lands or settle in foreign soils,\nbut instead cherishes parents and loves siblings,\nholding death in reverence and not straying far—\nthen a world of tranquility, harmony, and kinship can be attained.\n\nThus, *\"charming our sovereign, cherishing this land,\"*\nthough there are boats and carriages,\nno one will venture far to foreign lands,\nleaving their ancestral homeland.\nWhen the court’s benevolence and grace penetrate to the marrow,\nits favor as deep as that of a parent,\nits bond as close as siblings—\neven rebellious and stubborn men will be transformed into the virtuous.\nThough there are armor and weapons,\nthey shall have no place to display them.\n\nThus, with the ruler serene and the people content,\nthe people at ease and the state prosperous,\nif one restores the governance of knotted cords\nand embraces the harmony of the *Tahe*,\ncherishing kin and honoring elders,\nsettling in their homes and tending their fields,\ndelighting in their food and clothing,\nproviding secure dwellings and joyful customs,\nand fostering simplicity to shape the wind of virtue—\nwhat fear is there that the state will be small or the people few,\nor that it will be difficult to achieve greatness and abundance through benevolence and virtue?\n\nWhen the people love their ruler as they do their parents,\nand the ruler regards his people as his children and siblings,\nwith unwavering loyalty and deep affection—\neven a moment’s separation would be unbearable.\nThough neighboring states are close enough to see and hear,\nfrom youth to old age, from birth to death,\nthe people shall not once visit them.\n\nThis is because the people, moved by gratitude and transformed by virtue,\nhold their ruler in profound reverence.\nThus, they enjoy the governance of *wuwei*\nand bask in the celestial favor of the Dao,\nnever willing to stray even a step.\nHow then could the state fear being small,\nor the people fear being few?\n\nNecessarily, their influence will extend to the four quarters,\ntheir reputation spread far and wide,\nand the world will turn to benevolence,\nall nations uniting in harmony.\n\n---\nThis is an analogy for those aged and weakened in *jing* and *qi* in their cultivation.\nWhen a person grows old,\ntheir *jing* and *qi* scatter,\ntheir lead and mercury diminish—\nto practice the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir seems nearly impossible.\nYet one does not realize that the matter of the Golden Elixir\ndoes not depend on postnatal *jing* and *qi*,\nbut on the primordial lead and mercury.\nIf one attains the supreme method of the True One,\nextracting and ingesting it,\nwhether old or young,\none may obtain the medicine in an instant or half a breath,\nachieving success in a thousand years or three months.\n\nThe only misfortune is that one does not hear of the True One *qi* of the primordial,\nbut instead relies on the postnatal, tangible *jing*—\nnot only will the elderly fail to achieve anything,\nbut even the young and vigorous will never succeed.\n\nAt the very outset of practice, one must forcefully endure,\nkeeping the hands from moving recklessly,\nthe feet from stepping lightly,\nthe eyes from gazing outward,\nthe ears from listening to extraneous sounds,\nthe mouth from speaking,\nand the mind from straying in idle thought—\nfrom morning till night,\ncleansing the mind of anxieties,\nnurturing the inner self,\nretiring into seclusion,\nso that not even a thread may pull at you,\nnor a speck of dust burden you.\nWith time, this accumulates until sincerity gives rise to clarity,\nand naturally,\nthe gaze turns inward,\nthe tongue’s vitality is preserved within,\nthe heart’s essence is stored internally,\nthe limbs move with ease,\nand every action aligns with the Dao.\n\nThis illustrates the principle of\n*\"a hundredfold vessel unused, yet when used, it lacks nothing.\"*\nThe term *\"min\"* (民) here compares to the body.\n\nAs one grows old,\nwho does not fear death with utmost intensity,\nor cherish life with profound longing?\nYet to fear death without knowing how to seek life\nis merely futile dread.\n\nOnly through meticulous solitude and constant inward observation,\nmoment by moment reflecting back,\nnever straying from the space of one’s own mind,\ndoes one, over time, attain harmony within—\nso that even the heavens and earth may find their proper place,\nand all things flourish under cultivation.\nHow much more so for the self,\nwhich remains unaligned and uncultivated?\n\nThis is the practice of nurturing the *Xuanhua* (玄化),\ncultivating the *Gu* (谷) spirit—\nenduring like a thread unbroken,\nusing it without strain;\never-present like a steady glow,\nguarding it without flaw;\nstill yet ever luminous,\nluminous yet ever still—\n*(that is, ever responsive yet ever tranquil,\nwithout force or artifice).*\n\nThis is what is meant by\n*\"moving yet unrestrained, still yet nurturing harmony.\"*\n\nIt does not involve manipulating the *Hecar* (河车) or shifting the *Doubing* (斗柄);\nnor does it require wielding martial might—\nthough battle may befit the field,\ndefense suits the city,\nand ritual purity is paramount—\ntaking analogy from the alchemist’s careful tending of the furnace,\nand the master’s strategic victory over adversity.\n\nThis is the method of pure cultivation,\nnot the craft of balancing *yin* and *yang* through supplementation.\nNot only can the elderly, through such discipline,\nobtain the elixir and return to their original state,\nbut even the young, adhering to this practice,\nmay persist unceasingly, without division or pause,\nharmonizing with the serene and reverent heavens.\n\nYet those who rush impatiently seek no swift results,\nand those who demand hasty completion are no true vessels.\nOnly through slow, leisurely cultivation—\nlike water’s gradual seepage,\nor fire’s steady permeation—\ndoes virtue refine and benevolence mature,\nand the Dao find fulfillment.\n\nThus,\n*\"Though there be chariots and carriages, they serve no purpose;\nThough there be armor and arms, they find no deployment.\"*\n\nThe advance and retreat, the ascent and descent,\nthe laws of morning concentration and evening obscurity—\nthe Supreme Sage has already spoken of this:\n*\"War is the precursor to years of calamity.\"*\nThis clearly shows that the practice of tending the furnace,\ngathering elixir, and kindling the fire\nis established solely for those whose post-natal *qi* is bound\nand whose essence is obscured by materiality—\nfor if one does not adhere to this method,\nthen ordinary *qi* cannot be transformed,\nand the true gold cannot be refined.\n\nIf one instead takes stillness as their practice,\navoiding all methods of boiling and simmering,\nand merely abides in emptiness and tranquility,\nthen unknowingly and without effort,\nin a state of non-action and non-thought,\none naturally becomes vast and boundless,\npure and upright in essence,\nsilently harmonized with Heaven,\nwithout need of speech, thought, or deliberation,\nflowing seamlessly with Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the *\"restoring of the people to the use of knotted cords.\"*\nNo texts are established, no words are relied upon,\nand yet *\"the Sage above does not use calculations.\"*\n*\"Let them find their food sweet and their garments fine,\"*\nand thus the essence permeates within,\nwhile the *qi* circulates without.\nSweet within and beautiful without—\nthere is that which cannot be named.\n\n*\"Let them dwell in contentment and take joy in their customs,\"*\nand then the heart finds its natural virtue,\nmoving wherever it wills, in perfect accord.\nWhen cultivation reaches this stage,\none’s clarity is ever-present, effortless, and unbound—\nencountering the world without attachment,\nmeeting things without being stained—\nthough sights and sounds may arise,\nthey are as though unseen and unheard,\nnever giving rise to thought through form and sound.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Neighboring states may be in view, yet there is no coming and going between them.\"*\n\nThis is the supreme and highest path,\nthe lowest and lowest path—\nthe most profound of profundities,\nthe most wondrous of wonders.\nAh!\n\nWhen cultivation reaches this stage, one is in great harmony with the Dao.\n\nSpeaking of Daoist practice, the ancients had two primary methods: those who cultivated through purity, and those who cultivated through yin-yang supplementation. Cultivation through purity means refining the void and unity—no need to refine essence or *qi*. Yet this is not for the ordinary practitioner; only those of superior root and capacity can speak of it. If one’s innate foundation is truly extraordinary, then from this single step onward, all actions align with the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth—unlike the teachings of my master today, which still involve contrivance.\n\nFor within the human body lie the mechanisms of yin-yang *kan* and *li*, *qián* and *kūn*, opening and closing, sun and moon, water and fire, ascent and descent, advance and retreat—just as the heavens move in their courses, all naturally, without need of artificial manipulation. One need only rectify the original spirit, letting it act without knowing, without thinking, without deliberation. Then the pure and empty *qi* surges boundlessly, naturally inhaling and exhaling, rising and falling like the opening and closing of *qián* and *kūn*, the movement of sun and moon, the ascent of water and descent of fire, the ebb and flow of yin and yang. Though there are stages of fire and heat, they are merely about calming the mind, reducing desires, maintaining stillness, and inner observation—letting true *qi* circulate without ceasing. Though there are advances and retreats, ascents and descents, they are merely about letting true water ascend and true fire descend.\n\nEven in alchemical bathing, it is only about restraining anger, suppressing desires, purifying thoughts, and cleansing the heart—so that the Great Harmony may dwell within. Though one may obtain elixirs and refine the pill, it is only about taking spirit as father and *qi* as mother, intertwining the two into a unified whole, merging without separation, and generating that primordial point of true essence that gave birth to Heaven and Earth—the true essence of the *li* palace, also called the true mercury of the human body. By refining my spirit-*qi* into this true mercury, a fetus forms, and later gives rise to the yang spirit, bones and flesh, blood and vessels, the five viscera and six bowels, hair and skin, clarity and awareness—none of which differ from the human form. Divided, it can manifest as myriad bodies; united, it returns to one *qi*—all arising from the union of spirit-father and *qi*-mother, their fusion forging this true mercury’s essence as the yang spirit.\n\nYet this true mercury requires the right moment to manifest. The heart governs the *qi* of the five viscera; when the central *qi* ascends, the *qi* of the five viscera ascends with it; when the central *qi* descends, the *qi* of the five viscera descends in turn. Its movement stems from the activity of true mercury; its stillness, from its repose. In essence, movement and stillness, ascent and descent—all belong to the natural Dao. One need only follow its natural operation.\n\nYet few ancient immortals began with this method. What is meant by yin-yang supplementation? First, one must recognize the foundation of the *Tàijí*, the emergence of primordial yang, and then invest this point of true yang *qi* into the *dāntián*, as if parents unite, their essence and blood merging into a cluster within the womb. This is the primordial true seed, planted in the *jiāngàn* palace of *qián*, where lead and mercury are refined daily, gradually growing until, one day, it emerges from the shell—only then does the immortal, free of the mortal form, appear. Without this true seed, one’s efforts are in vain. Though some attainment may be made, it will only preserve the physical body and never generate the transcendent form.\n\nDo you understand? With this point of true yang *qi* planted in the womb, one may then direct divine light downward. Over time, as the true yang stirs, one may draw the water of *kān* upward and guide the fire of *lí* downward, refining all the turbid yin dross and corpse-*qi* of the physical form, extracting only pure *qi* to combine with my luminous yang, merging into the pill, nourishing it into spirit—thus achieving flight and transformation. Yet even this is the natural Dao.\n\nOrdinary mortals, trapped in the post-heavenly realm, have depleted spirit and *qi*, and their years grow old. Like travelers far from home, they must return from afar—hence the need for effort. Since spirit and *qi* remain divided, unable to unite, during seated practice, one must focus intent and expend some energy, drawing both spirit and *qi* into the *dāntián*, forbidding even a thread to escape or a breath to stray. One breath in, ten breaths out; ten breaths in, a hundred out—it matters not. Thus, sealing the great gate, preserving spirit at the elixir bolt, one practices in stages. Then, when external breathing pauses, true breathing begins. Again, one nourishes it, and soon the true yang *qi* surges like wind and clouds—then one quickly opens the pass and guides it upward. Its ascent is guided by spirit, not *qi*; one need only focus the mind on the *wěilú* and proceed.\n\nWhen the true *qi* rushes forth, one nourishes it briefly before descending. In short, when true yang first stirs, some effort is required before ascent or descent becomes possible. For the turbid *qi* of the mortal form is too heavy; only vigorous agitation can dispel its filth, revealing the pure and luminous spirit-*qi* that will become the foundation of the pill. Hence the ancients said: *\"At first, one gathers the medicine—without fierce, martial fire and urgent refining, true gold cannot be extracted from the ore. This is why martial fire is called ‘wild battle.’\"*\n\nOnce ascent and descent are complete, when the *dāntián* is full and the mind at ease, one may then employ the method of refining the void, following the *qi*’s natural movements to perfect it.\n\n「This, though seemingly forced, is indeed the natural way things must be—one should practice accordingly.\n\n**Chapter Eighty-One: Acting Without Striving**\n*\"Genuine words are not adorned; adorned words are not genuine.*\n*The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\n*The wise do not seek vast knowledge; those who seek vast knowledge lack true wisdom.\n*The Sage does not hoard.*\n\n*Having given to others, the Sage gains even more;\nHaving shared with others, the Sage’s virtue increases.*\n\n*The Dao of Heaven is beneficial yet not harmful;\nThe Dao of the Sage is to act without striving.*\n\nThis chapter summarizes the entire text, showing that all words of the *Moral Teachings* are true and unerring. One must not dismiss this scripture merely because its language is not elegant, placing it aside without discussion or contemplation.\n\n*Know that the Dao has no name—it is forcibly named as the Way;\nThe Way has no words—all words are obstacles.*\n\nYet for the sake of teaching and guiding beings, one must establish provisional names as stepping-stones for later learners. Once words are spoken, they must come from sincerity, and their expression must be measured and true.\n\n*This is indeed a profound and earnest discourse,*\n*aligned with antiquity yet free from error,*\n*applied to the present yet universally fitting.*\n*Without embellishment or falsehood,*\n*it requires no rhetorical flourish—why seek excess?*\n*Direct transmission and unadorned guidance reveal the very nature of one’s own mind.*\n\n*Words are genuine when spoken from sincerity—no need for ornamentation.*\n*As for eloquent prose and literary grace,*\n*that is the speech of scholars and literati,*\n*who adorn themselves with superficial brilliance to please the world,*\n*yet their words lack true authenticity.*\n\n*If their words are genuine and they act with virtue,*\n*they need not resort to sophistry to deceive others—what need for argument then?*\n*Those who argue are like the deaf and blind claiming sharp hearing and keen sight,*\n*pretending to wisdom beyond their actual grasp,*\n*covering ears while stealing bells—*\n*such behavior is hardly virtuous.*\n\n*Virtue lies within oneself, wisdom within one’s heart—*\n*why must it be vast?*\n*Confucius said, “My Way is one, and it runs through all things.”*\n*Mencius said, “The Way is but one.”*\n*What need for breadth is there?*\n\n*Those who seek breadth are like those who fail to grasp the Way’s true essence,*\n*whose words lack proper alignment,*\n*who wander through the doctrines of myriad schools—*\n*this is mere memorization and rhetorical study,*\n*not the Sage’s profound learning in the classics,*\n*nor the cultivation of the Great and Just through proper conduct.*\n\n*In essence, the Way is such that nothing exists beyond it.*\n*It can be taken without restraint,*\n*used without exhaustion.*\n\n*The Sage is both empty and not empty,*\n*both possessing and not possessing.*\n*Like a bright mirror suspended in the void,*\n*reflecting clear waves without end—*\n*how could there be any accumulation?*\n*If there were accumulation,*\n*it would mean the mirror is stained with dust,*\n*the water is muddied with sediment—*\n*this is not the Sage’s original, empty and luminous essence,*\n*nor the boundless and impartial nature of the Sage.*\n\n*Only when the Sage’s essence is thus empty and luminous,*\n*does he respond to circumstances and follow natural inclinations.*\n*Though the myriad people are in chaos,*\n*virtue cannot be universally applied,*\n*yet if one man bears guilt and takes responsibility,*\n*his virtue is already complete.*\n\n*Even if all nine regions are aligned,*\n*blessings cannot reach everywhere,*\n*yet if one place remains untouched by kindness,*\n*this heart will always bear sorrow.*\n*In giving to others,*\n*how could there be any excess in humility?*\n\n*Thus it is said:*\n*Having given to others, the Sage’s merit grows even greater;\nHaving shared with others, the Sage’s virtue becomes even more abundant.*\n\n*It is like the mirror’s light—*\n*when things approach, they are reflected;*\n*when things depart, the reflection ceases,*\n*with no premeditated intent in between.*\n\n*The Sage’s heart is also as such.*\n\n*Moreover,*\n*The Sage’s heart is the very heart of Heaven,*\n*The Sage’s Way is the very Way of Heaven.*\n\n*Heaven operates in silent transformation,*\n*though there are phases of waxing and waning,*\n*of fullness and emptiness—*\n*all belong to the mechanism of nurturing life,*\n*offering benefit without harm.*\n\n*The Sage acts without contrivance,*\n*though there may be loss or gain,*\n*bestowal or deprivation—*\n*all belong to the response of benevolence,*\n*also acting without striving.*\n\n*If Heaven and Earth were to act with benefit or harm,*\n*then Heaven and Earth would be partial, not impartial,*\n*and how could they endure for ten thousand years without change?*\n*If the Sage were to act with contrivance or striving,*\n*then the Sage would hoard, not disperse,*\n*and how could his utmost sincerity persist without end?*\n\n*Ah!*\n*Heaven and Earth are vast; the Sage is vast.*\n*Even if words are genuine,*\n*they arise from the heart’s expression,*\n*without pretense or artifice.*\n*Rooted in self and verified among the common people,*\n*it is the inherent virtue of Heaven,*\n*a shared faculty of all human hearts.*\n\n*To act for others is to act for oneself,*\n*to give to others is to give to oneself.*\n*This is the principle of unity between self and other,*\n*of shared origin between Heaven and humanity,*\n*where the Sage aligns with Heaven’s virtue,*\n*and his measure is revealed.*\n\n**Closing Words**\nNow that this scripture’s annotations are complete, I call upon all my disciples and say:\n\n*\"Today, the Great Dao is as fragile as a pile of eggs.\nIt depends on you, those who study the Way,\nto uphold Heaven and Earth,\nto rectify and restore the cosmic balance.\n\nEven if one speaks of the wicked and rebellious,\nthere may be conflict and violence,\nyet Heaven has its arrangements—\nit will never allow you to face unforeseen calamity.\n\nOnly fear that you may hold virtue too narrowly,\nfail to embrace the Way with sincerity,\nwaver in resolve—\nsometimes acting, sometimes abandoning it—\nfor then you sever your connection with Heaven.\n\nUnable to align with Heaven above,\neven if Heaven bestows its tenfold benevolence\nand desires to nurture you in a realm of peace and tranquility,\nhow could you receive and uphold Heaven’s grace if you cannot meet it halfway?\n\nYou have now nearly attained the Way and understood its essence,\nmastering its practice with firm conviction.\nOnly when you move or speak,\nmust you breathe in harmony with Heaven—\nthen Heaven will love and cherish you,\nembrace and protect you without ceasing.\n\nFor the Way is Heaven’s presence,\nto cherish the Way is to cherish Heaven,\nto love the Way is to love Heaven.\n\nWhen such silent accord is achieved,\nyou will naturally attain auspicious blessings.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is inherently aligned with the Way of humanity—\nobserve throughout antiquity and the present,\nonly those who defy the Way fail to gain Heaven’s favor,\nnever has one who follows the Way failed to receive Heaven’s blessing.\nYou should now awaken to this truth.\n\nIn summary,*\n*each should follow their own conviction,*\n*each should fulfill their own sincerity.*\n*Beyond this, external judgments of right and wrong,*\n*of fortune and misfortune,*\n*all belong to Heaven’s ultimate decree.*\n*You must not fret over taking others’ roles—*\n*leave such concerns to Heaven.\"*」\n\n「The essence of the Great Dao lies solely in the interplay of **shén** [神, spirit/mind] and **qì** [氣, qi].\n\nYet there is a distinction between **xiān tiān** [先天, prenatal] and **hòu tiān** [後天, postnatal]—this the cultivator must never fail to grasp.\n\nThe ancient scriptures say:\nThe **xiān tiān yuán shén** [先天元神, primordial prenatal spirit] is the **tǐ** [體, substance];\nThe **hòu tiān shí shén** [後天識神, postnatal awakened spirit] is the **yòng** [用, function].\nWithout the **xiān tiān yuán shén**, the Great Dao has no **zhǔ** [主, master];\nWithout the **hòu tiān shí shén**, the Great Dao lacks application.\n\nYou must diligently refine and cultivate—\nat the moment when all is **hún hún** [混混, obscure] and **duì duì** [沌沌, chaotic],\nwhen there is neither knowing nor awareness,\nyou must nurture the **xiān tiān yuán shén** to serve as sovereign.\n\nThen, with a sudden start and awakening,\nthe **hòu tiān shí shén** emerges—\nnot the fleeting, erratic **sī shí** [私識, private perceptions],\nbut the **zhèng děng zhèng jué** [正等正覺, true and proper awakened spirit],\nwhich stirs and brings forth cognition—hence it is called **shí shén** [識神, spirit of discernment].\n\nFear only that once this **shí shén** arises,\nit will be **fēn fēn rǎo rǎo** [紛紛擾擾, tumultuous and disturbed],\nwith delusive, chaotic thoughts flooding endlessly—\nand you will fall into **sī liú** [私流, private currents] and **yù** [欲, desire],\nrendering you incapable of refining the **dān** [丹, elixir].\n\nOnly when the mind is **yī xīn liào zhào** [一心了照, singularly illuminated]\nand your resolve is **shì zhì méi tā** [矢志靡它, unwaveringly fixed]\nwill your scattered thoughts cease,\nyour **shén** [神, spirit] congeal,\nand your breath become regulable—\nfor breath adjusted, the elixir will form.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"A single mind focused on the silk threads,\nno sight of the white reeds across the river.\"*\n\nEven though called **shí shén** [識神, spirit of discernment],\nits nature is that of the **yuán shén** [元神, primordial spirit].\n\nHence the ancients declared:\n*\"Heaven’s heart as sovereign, primordial spirit as function.\nSkillfully employ the thief’s mechanism,\nreturning it to the造化 [zào huà, creative transformation] of yin and yang.\"*\nWhat need then for fear of failing to ascend to **shèng shén** [聖神, sacred spirit]!\n\nDo you also comprehend this truth?\nIn essence, once Heaven’s heart is activated,\nyou must constantly **wěn xù** [常常穩蓄, stabilize and contain it],\nnot allowing a single thought to wander,\na single breath to stray into impurity—\nthen Heaven’s heart will remain steadfast,\nthe Dao-heart will congeal,\nand though **shí** [識, discernment] exists, it will be as if it does not.\n\nFor the scholar refining **zhēn** [真, the True],\nat the very outset of practice,\nthe key lies in subduing the mind\nand silencing the **máng shí** [妄識, false perceptions] of the eyes, ears, body, and intentions.\nThus, you gather the spirit at the **dān qiāng** [丹扃, elixir gate],\nand regulate the breath at the **dān tián** [丹田, elixir field],\nstriving to extinguish all **fán xī** [凡息, ordinary breaths],\nuntil the **yuán qì** [元氣, primordial qi] begins to submit.\n\nOnce the **yuán qì** [元氣, primordial qi] returns,\n**yīn yīn** [氤氤, misty] and **huó pō** [活泼, lively],\n**wǎn zhuǎn yōu yáng** [宛轉悠揚, undulating and free],\nlike a living dragon in motion—\ntenfold vigor and vitality.\n\nThis robust **yuán qì** [元氣, primordial qi] suffices to operate the **hé chē** [河車, River Vehicle].\n\nIf the **qì** [氣, qi] and **jī** [機, mechanism] surge violently,\nand you fail to perform the **hé chē** [河車, River Vehicle] method—\ntransforming **jīng** [精, essence] into **qì** [氣, qi],\nand **qì** [氣, qi] into **shén** [神, spirit]—\nyou must still congeal at the **dān dǐng** [丹鼎, elixir cauldron].\nYet without proper **huǒ huà** [火化, fire transformation],\nthe **yīn jīng** [陰精, yin essence] cannot solidify,\nand will not remain long in the **hòu tiān dǐng** [後天鼎, postnatal cauldron].\nThe moment **fán huǒ** [凡火, ordinary fire] stirs,\nit will incite **yīn gēn** [淫根, lustful roots]\nand **shēng yín shì** [生淫事, generate lustful matters],\nand all will be lost.\n\nEven if you forcefully suppress it,\npreventing any movement,\nthe **hòu tiān jīng qì** [後天精氣, postnatal essence-qi]\nare all of pure **yīn** [陰, yin],\nuntempered and unrefined—\nthey will inevitably leak,\nwhether suppressed or not.\n\nWith this method practiced,\nyou can seize control from Heaven, Earth, and the **guǐ shén** [鬼神, spirits and demons],\nand master the **zào huà yīn yáng** [造化陰陽, transformative laws of yin and yang],\nthus commanding and reclaiming:\n*\"My life is mine to command, not Heaven’s.\"*\n\nThis is the Dao of the **cháng shēng bù lǎo** [長生不老, immortal longevity],\nthe so-called **Yán luó lǎo zǐ** [閻羅老子, Lord of the Underworld]\nhaving no power over you.\n\nThus, the method must not be revealed to the unworthy,\nlest Heaven’s spirit lose its authority over **shàn è bào yìng** [善惡報應, virtue and vice, rewards and retributions].\n\nDo you also grasp this intent?\nYou must **jǐn cuī màn gǔ** [緊催慢鼓, tightly urge and slowly strike],\nactivating the **tuó tǔ jī guān** [橐龠機關, bellows mechanism],\nuntil **fán xī** [凡息, ordinary breaths] cease,\n**zhēn xī** [真息, true breaths] emerge,\nthe human heart dies,\nand the Dao-heart is reborn.\n\nThis **hé chē** [河車, River Vehicle] method is as described.\nYet if applied indiscriminately to **shǒu zhōng** [守中, holding the center],\nbefore the **qì jī** [氣機, qi mechanisms] are unobstructed,\nand the **xīn shén** [心神, mind-spirit] is at peace,\nmerely relying on **chún rèn zìrán** [純任自然, absolute passivity],\nhow can the spirit and qi ever coalesce?\nWhat medicinal substance could you then extract?\n\nThis must be done when the **xuān guān** [玄關, Mysterious Gate] first appears—\nas the **shèn qì** [腎氣, kidney qi] ascends\nand the **xīn yè** [心液, heart fluid] descends,\nemploying the **shù xī** [數息, counted breaths] as **wǔ huǒ** [武火, martial fire],\nwithout allowing a single thought to stray,\na single breath to rush unchecked.\n\nOnly then will the **fán xī** [凡息, ordinary breaths] still,\nthe **zhēn xī** [真息, true breaths] manifest,\nthe human heart perish,\nand the Dao-heart arise.\n\nIf you speak loosely of **naturalness** [自然],\nthere can be no **naturalness** at all.\n\nThus it is said: Even those with **innate wisdom** [生知, *shēngzhī*]—the **sages** [聖人, *shèngrén*]—\nmust still **descend to labored knowledge** [下困知勉行工夫, *xiàkùn zhī miǎnxíng gōngfū*],\nand only then will they attain it.\n\nThe ancients spoke:\n*\"The White Tiger of West Mountain rages unchecked,*\n*the Green Dragon of East Sea cannot be withstood.*\n*With both hands seize them to make them fight to the death—*\n*transformed into a single mass of purple jade frost.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"To subdue the Dragon, your will must be as vast as Heaven,*\n*to tame the Tiger, your heart must be bold, your qi like smoke.*\n*Even a **foolish and dullard** [痴蠢愚人, *chīchōng yúrén*] can grasp this,*\n*and I will teach them to stand upon the earth as **transcendent beings** [神仙, *shénxiān*].\"*\n\nThis **martial fire** [武火, *wǔhuǒ*],\nwhen applied to the time when **Dragon and Tiger** [龍虎, *lónghǔ*] do not yet meet,\nwhen **water and fire** [水火, *shuǐhuǒ*] do not yet harmonize,\nthen it may be used.\nBut if practicing the **River Vehicle** [河車, *héchē*],\nwhen **Dragon roars and Tiger howls** [龍吟虎啸, *lóngyín hǔxiào*],\nwhen **husband and wife respond in unison** [夫唱妇随, *fūchàng fùsuí*],\nand you still employ this method,\nthen you risk **forcing the true qi to scatter and disperse** [迫逐真气散乱, *pòizhú zhēnqì sànluàn*],\nas **Mencius** [孟子] said:\n*\"Like chasing a **fleeing piglet** [放豚, *fàngtún*],*\n*once it

      "translated_text": "**Preface (Excerpt)**\n\n**Note:**\nThe annotated edition of *The Daoist Classic of Laozi and Zhuangzi* was republished in Taiwan in 1970 under the title *The Refined Essence of the Daoist Classic*. In its preface, it states: “The Huang [commentary] is particularly profound, truly revealing the mysterious Dao, each word bearing essential meaning. Thus, it should rightly be called *‘Refined Essence’* rather than *‘Annotated’*—hence the name change upon reissue, to benefit all.”\n\nThe following excerpt is taken from Xiao Tian Shi’s preface to the large-character edition of *The Refined Essence of the Daoist Classic*.\n\n**(I)** Across the ages, hundreds of scholars have annotated *The Daoist Classic*, with over fifty editions included in *The Daoist Canon*. The earliest commentaries were by Han Fei and He Shang Gong. Han Fei provided only *“Explicating Laozi”* and *“Parables of Laozi”*, while systematic annotation began with He Shang Gong. Among all the commentaries that have flourished over the millennia, the Wang Bi edition stands preeminent. During the Tang and Song dynasties, lesser scholars proliferated, and their works gradually increased in number—perhaps twenty to thirty enduring fine editions—but few achieved complete fidelity without error.\n\n**(II)** The annotated editions within *The Daoist Canon* each possess their merits: the Tang Xuanzong edition emphasizes **exhausting principles and perfecting nature** (穷理尽性), **sitting in forgetfulness and abandoning traces** (坐忘遗照), **reducing matters and non-action** (损事无为), and **governing the body and affairs** (理身理事); the Song Huizong edition, comprising three versions, frequently cites passages from *The Zuo Tradition* and *The Book of Changes* (《左》、《易》) to support its interpretations. The Ming Taizu edition’s annotations adhere strictly to **cultivating harmony and achieving peace** (修齐治平), while Su Shi’s son, Su Zhe’s commentary, delves deeply into the **root essence** (根宗), offering many insights into **nature’s intrinsic essence** (性之言) and harmonizing the perspectives of three schools into a singular intent. In the Qing dynasty, Daoist talents emerged in abundance, with Longyuanzi, Song Changqing, and Master Huang Yuangji producing the finest commentaries. Among these, Master Huang’s work most effectively **follows the strengths of each school** (宗各家之所长) and **complements their shortcomings** (补百家之不足). The Song dynasty edition has already been published in the *Daoist Canon*’s third collection; this edition reprints Master Huang’s commentary within it.\n\n**(III)** The distinctive features of Master Huang’s commentary are as follows: each chapter begins with **the eternal Dao** (常道), followed by **the Dao of alchemy** (丹道); it first discusses **worldly methods** (世法), then **alchemical methods** (丹法). The subtleties of Daoist learning are meticulously examined, with **profound meaning and refined logic** (精微，文理密察). It encompasses both **fundamentals and applications** (本末兼赅), harmonizing **form and function** (体用咸宜).",

      "translated_text": "「Its excellence lies in **fusing Confucianism into Dao** (融儒入道) while leaving **no trace of artificiality** (凿空无痕); and in **expanding Dao to exalt Confucianism** (因道弘儒) while maintaining **a unified and complete whole** (浑全一体). It clarifies **the Dao and cultivates virtue** (明道修德), thereby setting **the standard for the customs of the world** (端天下之风尚); and it **nurtures the heart and harmonizes the qi** (养心养气), sufficient to **rectify the minds of all beings** (正成世之人心). The author **illuminates the Dao of immortality** (明仙道) through **every word as unbreakable truth** (字字金科玉律); and **embodies the sacred learning** (体圣学) to elucidate **mystical studies** (阐玄学), with **each utterance a direct transmission of the essence** (言言口诀心传). Deep yet accessible, warm and straightforward—**putting it into practice** (以之为用), one may **clarify the mind and perceive true nature** (明心见性), **attain sainthood and ascend to the Dao** (入圣登真), **manifest wisdom in worldly affairs** (明哲处世), or **govern the state and bring peace to the world** (治国平天下). Whether in **official life or seclusion**, it is equally applicable (仕隐咸宜). Judging by its merit, it is **indeed an immortal masterpiece** (不朽名着) among commentaries on the *Dao De Jing*. **Regardless of Daoist or Confucian schools**, all may **revere it as the supreme scripture** (无上圣经), viewing it as **the unparalleled path to sainthood and immortality** (修圣修仙之不二法门).\n\n**(IV)** The **alchemical Dao’s texts grow ever more profound with age** (丹道经籍，愈古愈玄). In the **Upper Antiquity**, **alchemical scriptures were hidden in nine out of ten** (上古丹经，十隐八九); in the **Middle Antiquity**, **half were concealed** (中古丹经，十隐其半); until **recent times**, only **two or three out of ten were revealed** (近代丹经，十隐二三). This work by Master Huang was completed during the **transition between the Daoguang and Xianfeng reigns of the Qing dynasty** (清道咸之交), hence its ability to **unfurl the mystic mechanisms** (畅述玄机) and **display the essence of the Dao** (大露宗风), revealing **what the past sages kept secret** (往圣之所不泄者) and transmitting **what the past sages never imparted** (往圣之所不传者). In terms of **alchemical methods alone** (就丹法言丹法), this single text **already encompasses the vital essence of myriad alchemical canons** (括尽千经万典之要蕴), **without omission of great or small** (巨细无遗).\n\nWhen Master Huang lectured at **Hall of Joyous Nurturing** (乐育堂), thousands of disciples entered his gate (入门弟子数千人). His works, *Hall of Joyous Nurturing Sayings* (《乐育堂语录》) and *Essentials of the Daoist Gate* (《道门语要》), have long circulated and are **held in high regard by the world** (风行，为世所重). Yet his *Oral Essentials of the Mystic Dao* (《玄宗口诀》) was **rarely copied and transmitted** (传抄很少). His texts such as *Seeking the Heart* (《求心》) and *Awakening the Heart* (《醒心》) have **already been lost** (已失传), and now that this work has been recovered, it is **unendurable to let it vanish again** (不忍再令其湮没).\n\n**(V)** This book was originally published in **Qing Guangxu Year 10** (清光绪十年), with its plates stored in **Ziliu井, Sichuan** (四川自流井, 今自贡市自井区). Errors such as **misprints of fish for deer and boar for pig** (鲁鱼亥豕) were numerous. Three years ago, a printed edition was obtained from **Mr. Yin Qitang** (殷启唐先生), later sent back to South America. This year, the **unpunctuated edition from Mr. Wan Yang’s Hall of Nurturing Virtue** (乙亥华阳汪氏养性斋刊本), preserved by **Mr. Ma Bingwen and Mr. Ma Jiekang**, was acquired. Subsequently, a **refined edition from the Nanjing Red Cross Daoist Institute** (南京红十字会道院精刊本) was obtained through **Mr. Fu Anding** (傅安澄先生). For this reprinting, the original plan was to use the **Hall of Nurturing Virtue edition** (马养性斋刊本), but after careful collation and correction, the **Daoist Institute edition** (傅藏道院刊本) was chosen instead. **Mr. Yu Zheng** (俞以正) was too busy with Buddhist affairs to write about the provenance of these collected editions.\n\n**Winter, 12th month, Year of the Rat (庚子孟冬月), Taipei** (台北),\n**Shen Shi Xiao Tian Shi** (文山肖天石) wrote this.\n\n**Master Huang’s Preface to the Original Edition: The Three Teachings’ Dao is the Dao of the Sage** (三教之道，圣道而已). Confucianism speaks of **ultimate sincerity** (至诚), Daoism of **golden elixir** (金丹), Buddhism of **true emptiness** (真空)—yet all **refer to the same primordial qi of the Great Void** (太虚一气), **pervading heaven, earth, and all beings** (贯乎天地人物). Only the **Sage uniquely probes its source** (独探其原) and **reaches its utmost** (造其极), **unifying with the boundless emptiness of heaven and earth** (与天地虚圆无二), thus becoming the Sage. It **can be both firm and yielding** (能刚能柔), **both circular and square** (可圆可方), **defying form or description** (无形状可拟), **transcending sound or scent** (无声臭可拘). Its **divine transformations and marvelous operations** (神灵变化) are **inexhaustible** (其妙无穷), with **aspects beyond comprehension** (有不可得而窥测者). If all is **natural and spontaneous** (皆自然天然), **originally so** (本来特事), **neither augmented by the Sage nor diminished by the ordinary** (处圣不增，处凡不减), then even **the lesser beings—birds, beasts, grasses, and trees** (鸟兽草木之微)—**share the same qi and the same principle** (同此一气、同此一理) as the Sage.\n\nConsider the **vast, unfathomable ocean** (汪洋大海). Though its waters are **most difficult to measure** (水至难测), a **single ladleful** (一勺) contains no less than the **entire sea** (一海). The **qi of the Great Void** (太虚之气) is **likewise boundless**. Though **heaven, earth, sages, and all beings** (天地、圣贤、人物) may appear **diverse and chaotic** (纷纭错杂), with **ten thousand things unequal** (万有不齐), their **initial reception of qi and formation** (受气成形之初) all **originate from the same qi** (同此一气). Beyond this, **there is no other vital qi** (别无生气), nor **any other generative principle** (别无生理)—what differs is merely **the varied dispositions and endowments** (姿禀之各殊).\n\nMencius said, **\"The Yao and Shun shared the same nature as ordinary people\"** (尧舜与人同); and again, **\"The distinction between humans and beasts is slight\"** (人之异于禽兽者几希). This is **indeed a true discourse** (诚确论也).",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter One: The Gateway to All Marvels**\n\n**The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;**\n**The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.**\n\nBefore the naming of Heaven and Earth, there was the Nameless—\nThe origin of all ten thousand things.\nThus, **to observe its marvel through desirelessness,**\nAnd **to observe its subtleties through desire.**\n\nThese two, though differing in name, arise from the same source,\nAnd are called the **Mysterious**—\n**Mysterious beyond measure, the gateway to all marvels.**\n\nZhūzǐ said: *\"The Dao is like a path, shared by all.\"*\n\nIn truth, it is the principle by which **Heaven, Earth, and all beings are born.**\nBefore Heaven and Earth were divided, this Dao hung in the boundless void;\nAfter Heaven and Earth were opened, this Dao was entrusted to the realms of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhat Dao is this?\nIt existed before Heaven and Earth and endures eternally,\nIt follows after Heaven and Earth yet never decays.\nBorn before Heaven and Earth, it mingles within the void—\n**Neither visible nor audible.**\n\nThus, the Supreme One says:\n*\"Speaking of the Dao, it is subtle and hidden—*\n**Truly, there is no Dao to speak of.**\nWhat can be spoken of are but its manifestations,\nNot the eternal Dao itself.\"*\n\n*\"Speaking of names, they are empty and without substance—*\n**Truly, there is no name to speak of.**\nWhat can be named are but its dregs,\nNot the eternal Name itself.\"*\n\nIf one does not know the Dao,\n**How shall one observe it in the *Odes*?**\nIt says: *\"The carriage of Heaven moves—*\n**Without sound, without scent\"**—\n*The Dao cannot be grasped in words!*\n\nAgain it says: *\"The mandate of Heaven is solemn and unceasing\"**—\n*The Dao cannot be without designation.*\n\nKnow that within the **uttermost void,**\nThere exists the **uttermost reality;**\nWithin the **uttermost emptiness,**\nThere exists the **uttermost substance.**\n\nThe Dao is truly beyond what can be spoken of.\n\nThe Supreme One, in boundless compassion, taught the world:\nBefore the **Hóngmèng** stirrings, all was **indistinct and formless**—\nThough called *Nameless*, yet Heaven, Earth, and all beings are nurtured within it.\nThus, it is the **beginning of Heaven and Earth.**\n\nWhen stillness endured long enough,\nAnd **qi** moved with a pulse,\nThen came the **Namable**—\nA vast **Tàihé** breath of primordial qi,\nCirculating through the cosmos,\nNourishing all life.\nThus, it is the **mother of all things.**\n\n*Beginning* refers to the **cluster of primordial qi** before Heaven and Earth opened;\n*Mother* refers to the **transformation and birth of all things** after their division.\n\nFor the student at the outset,\nThere is no other method—\nOnly **sitting upright with a focused mind,**\n**Discarding all thoughts,**\n**Observing with a veiled gaze.**\n\nBeneath the heart, above the kidneys,\nThere seems a **void within the void.**\n**Spirit and qi** reflect each other,\n**Breath by breath, returning endlessly.**\nLet them **flow in and out naturally,**\nBut **concentrate both spirit and qi** in the **central palace** as the primary focus.\n\nIn no time, **spirit and qi merge as one.**\nThen, **listen to the indistinct murmur,**\n**Without a single conscious thought.**\nAfter long practice, **dimly aware,**\nOne enters the realm of **\"Where-Nothing-Is.\"**\n\nAt this moment,\nOne does not know if **spirit enters qi or qi returns to spirit**—\n**All is undifferentiated, beyond self and world, beyond place and Heaven,**\nYet not in **stupor**—\nFor if in stupor, one would become **a withered tree, cold ashes.**\n\nThe cultivator, having reached this point,\n**Must extinguish the stirring of thought,**\n**Yet preserve the luminous awareness.**\nOnly thus—**wise yet appearing foolish, enlightened yet not acting**—\nIn the instant of **no-knowing, no-awareness,**\nA sudden **awakening stirs,**\nAnd the **Tàijí** is established.\n\nKnow that within this **awakening,**\n**Spontaneous and unforced,**\nLies one’s **original true awareness.**\nThe Daoists call this the **Mysterious Gateway, the Subtle Aperture**—\nFound in **each inhalation and exhalation.**\n\nWhen inhaling, it is **yin, stillness, non-being;**\nWhen exhaling, it is **yang, motion, being.**\nEven in this **single breath,**\nThere lies a **subtle aperture.**\n\nIf one seeks **true awakening,**\nIt is in this **moment of awakening**—\nA **truly real, undeniably solid, thought-free, dross-free original self** that emerges.\n\nThus it is said:\n**Heaven and Earth awaken with this moment and give birth to ten thousand things;**\n**Humans awaken with this moment and forge the Golden Elixir.**\n\nBut this awakening is **like lightning and a spark—**\nPresent in the instant, yet gone in a blink.\nThe difference lies in **a hair’s breadth.**\n\nThe scholar must **discern this clearly in ordinary times**\nTo **grasp it firmly when the moment arises.**\n\nEven the **Great Awakened Ones** of old\nAchieved nothing beyond this **accumulation of awakening.**\n\nIf the cultivator does not begin with\n**Desirelessness and desire, observing marvel and aperture,**\nThen from where shall they establish their foundation?\n\nThough **non-being and being, marvel and aperture**\nAre but **yin-stillness and yang-motion**—\n**One breath divided into two breaths,**\nYet the two breaths still return to **one breath.**\n\nWhen stillness endures long enough and motion arises,\n**Non-being generates being—**\nCalled **\"One Yang is born, the Active Child.\"**\n\nWhen motion reaches its peak and returns to stillness,\n**Being returns to non-being—**\nCalled **\"Returning to the Root, restoring the Mandate.\"**\n\nAll are but the **divided yin and yang of the Supreme Ultimate.**\n\nThough differing in name,\nThey arise from **one source—**\nThe Supreme One calls it **Mysterious.**\n**Mysterious** means **profound and distant.**\n\nThe scholar who seeks the **Mysterious Dao**\nMust **be still again and again,**\n**Be steadfast yet again,**\nUntil within, **all is undisturbed—**\nThis is **observing marvel through desirelessness.**\n**The first Mysterious.**\n\nWhen **qi stirs and moves,**\nThough there is awareness, **no single thought arises;**\nThough there is motion, **no single notion lingers.**\n**One mind, no dual thoughts—**\nThis is **observing aperture through desire.**\n**The second Mysterious.**\n\nAs for **Mysterious beyond measure,**\nIt is truly the **return to the Root—**\nWhat else could be the **Gateway to All Marvels?**\n\nAlas, though common folk possess this **subtle aperture,**\nThey do not **nurture it directly,**\nThus it **opens and closes in vain,**\nUntil it is **exhausted without end.**",

care,**\nNever allowing it to stray for an instant—\nThus **directly attaining** the **Supreme Root Source**,\nAnd **becoming** the **Great Awakened Golden Immortal.**\n\nThe **initial practice** lies within the **Mysterious Gateway** and **Aperture.**\nThe **First Chapter** of the *Taoist Canon* already points out\n**The Nameless and the Named,**\n**Observing Marvel through Desirelessness** and **Observing Aperture through Desire,**\nSufficiently revealing that **cultivation of the Dao**\nDeparts from nothing else but this **Mysterious Gateway** and **Aperture.**\nHence, the **opening four

**this fleeting glance,**\nWithout **the wisdom-pearl** or **the insight-sword,**\nOne cannot attain it.\n\nEssentially, **the moment thoughts arise** is the **Mysterious Feminine,**\nTruly the **beginning of Heaven’s splitting and Earth’s opening.**\nSince ancient times, **divine immortals and sages**\nHave all been **born from this moment of awakening and movement.**\n\nIt is also said:\n**\"Observing Marvel through Desirelessness,\"**\n**\"Observing Aperture through Desire,\"**\nThese two—**one still, one moving**—\nMutually **serve as their own roots,**\nThus **same in

without,**\nCannot be **named or described by measure.**\n\nEven if the **tongue hangs like a suspended river,**\nIt cannot **utter a single word** of its truth—\nHence it is called **Mysterious beyond Mysterious.**\n\nThe scholar **must not regard it as distant and obscure,**\nYet **still fails to inquire** into its **concrete reality.**\n\nIf one **truly seeks it** in this **dim and hazy** state,\nWhile others see it as **flickering and vague,**\nFor oneself, it is **graspable and certain.**\n\nWith **time, practice brings forth vitality,**\nAnd **each step aligns with the Dao.**\n**Chapter Two: *Accomplishment without Dwelling***\n\nAll under Heaven know **beauty** as **beauty**—\nThen **ugliness** already arises;\nAll know **goodness** as **goodness**—\nThen **non-goodness** already appears.\n\nThus, **the presence and absence of forms** are **interdependent,**\n**Difficulty and ease** **complement each other,**\n**Length and shortness** **define one another,**\n**High and low** **lean toward equilibrium,**\n**Sounds and voices** **harmonize together,**\n**Before and after** **follow in sequence.**\n\nHence, the **Sage acts in

vital body,\nReturning to the Root and Source—this is the Elixir Sage.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Exhaustively seek the origin of your vital body at the moment of receiving life,\nDo not blame the Heavenly

**\"Hidden and Subtle\"**—\nWithin it lies the **essence of unseen and unheard.**\nIn **Buddhism**, it is called **\"That\"**—\nWithin it lies the **true reality of neither good nor evil.**\nIn **Daoism**, it is called **\"Mysterious Gateway\"**—\nWithin it lies the **depth of no thought and no deliberation.**\n\nThe **Great Dao’s Root Source**\nUltimately **originates from here.**\nOnce **imagined or conceptualized,**\nIt **falls into the trap of duality;**\nOnce **discussed or theorized,**\nIt **traps itself in the net of words.**\nThough **ancient sages and immortals**\nPraise the

**contrasted by deformity.**\nMoreover, **beauty is present here, yet ugliness too;**\n**Goodness is present here, yet deformity too.**\nThis is **indeed the post-Heavenly interplay of yin and

spirit beyond the form,**\n**One breath in, one breath out,**\n**One forward, one backward,**\n**Qi must return to the Mysterious Aperture.**\n\n**Breathing follows naturalness**—\nThis is the **root of Heaven, Earth, and all beings,**\nThe **foundation of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,**\nThe **most secret heavenly mechanism** of our **Daoist School,**\n**Not to be lightly divulged.**\n\nFor

in resonance, unsummoned yet arriving.\n\n**Front and back follow one another**—\nThis is **the Child racing behind**, **the Noon descending ahead**,\n**Heaven and Earth in union**, **harmonized as one mass**,\nClinging yet never parting.\n\nThese are all **returning the post-heaven yin-yang to the pre-heaven Non-Extreme**.\n\nThe Sage knows the **root of the Way**—\n**Vague and boundless, vast and untraceable**—\nIn governing affairs, **he prizes non-action**,\nAnd follows the **reverent self-restraint, the flowing robe** of old.\n\nIn teaching, **he takes silence as his principle**,\nAnd embodies the **subtle transformation of spirit-preservation**.\n\nThe Sage acts, and all things behold—\nWhat difficulty could there be?\n\nThus, **plowing fields and digging wells**,\nThey are born into life yet forget their own deeds;\n**Opening sources and regulating flow**,\nThey guide transformation yet erase their own traces.\n\nEven if their **virtue fills Heaven and Earth**,\nAnd their name resounds across the world,\nThe Sage would still **shun it as shameful**—\nFor empty fame has never borne real achievement.\n\nHow could it compare to the *Book of Documents* saying:\n*\"You alone do not boast, do not vaunt yourself—*\n*None under Heaven can contend with you in ability, in merit,\"*\nYet still **diminish the thought of human strife**?\n\nThis is surely the realm of **spirit-transformation**,\nThe **tranquil and settled heaven**,\nWhere one simply **finds contentment in self-sufficiency**,\nNever forgetting the **true essence of self-realization**.\n\nThe ancients spoke of **viewing wealth and nobility as fleeting clouds**,\nAnd **discarding fame like worn-out shoes**—\nIs this not what they meant?\n\nYet, **when the Way is complete, virtue stands firm**,\n**Achievement realized, name naturally follows**.\n\nThough the Sage does not claim merit,\nThe world and future ages **ceaselessly praise the Way**—\nThus, **without speaking of merit, merit matches sun and moon**,\n**Without speaking of name, name weighs heavier than antiquity**.\n\nOnly because **he does not dwell on it** does it not depart.\n\nStudents must **from the utmost emptiness and profound stillness**,\nNurture forth the **true essence of neither beauty nor goodness**,\nOnly then can cultivation have its foundation.\n\nWhat is this Way?\n**The Mysterious Pass**!\n\nAbandon this, and there is **no life**.\nThe cultivator, **abandoning this Mysterious Pass**,\nHas no other so-called Way.\n\nIf one takes **beauty and goodness as the Way**,\nIt is but **post-heaven dust and filth**.\n\nThe *Taoist Canon* warns of this,\nHoping people will **trace the source from the flow**.\n\nOtherwise, the praise of **beauty and goodness**\nIs also the virtue of the **gentlemen of the Three Dynasties**—\nHow could one blame them too severely?\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"One yin, one yang—this is the Way.\"*\nThus, **yang is not the Way**, **yin is not the Way**—\nThe Way lies **between yin and yang**!\n\nMoreover, the **Way is principle**, **yin and yang are qi**.\nPrinciple without qi cannot stand,\nQi without principle cannot move.\n\nTo speak of the Way alone is **formless and indescribable**,\nOnly when observed through **yin and yang’s manifestations**\nDoes it truly have **concrete evidence**.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the **true essence of neither goodness nor beauty**,\nDirectly **uncovering the root of the Great Way**,\nHoping people will **establish their foundation and set their extreme**,\nAs the basis for **cultivating the self and governing the world**.\n\nThe phrases on **ease and difficulty, presence and absence**\nTeach one to **return from opposing yin-yang to the true unity of qi**.\nWithin this, it also teaches one to **seek the Mysterious Pass**\nAs the **root of elixir-refining**.\n\nAs for **preserving the Center and nurturing the Elixir**,\n**The Child’s vitality thriving**, **turning the River-Chariot**—\nAll are **layered revelations**.\n\nOnly the Sage points directly to the source,\nThus **reverent self-restraint and non-action**,\n**Silent yet trusted**—\nThough there is **action and doing**, in oneself there is **no trace of virtue**.\n\nWhen achievement is complete and one retires,\nTo **view wealth and nobility as unworthy of weight**—\nWho but the Sage could attain this learning?\n\nStudents ponder and gain insight—\nNot only do they have a **foundation for practice**,\nBut also a **path to transcendence**.\n\nOther commentaries say:\n*\"All under Heaven know why beauty and goodness are beauty and goodness,*\n*Then they themselves will not do evil or wrong.\"*\nThis teaching is also correct.\n\nBut the *Taoist Canon* speaks mostly from the **source**,\nNot falling into the **Two Vehicles**.\n\n**Chapter Three:**\n*\"See no desirable things,*\n*Hold no virtue in high regard—*\n*Thus the people do not contend.*\n*Do not prize hard-to-obtain goods—*\n*Thus the people do not steal.*\n*See no desirable things—*\n*Thus the heart does not乱 (be disturbed).\"*\n\nTherefore, the Sage’s governance—\n**Empty their minds, fill their bellies,**\n**Weaken their wills, strengthen their bones,**\n**Always keep the people in ignorance and desirelessness,**\nSo that even the wise **dare not act**.\n\n**Non-action**—\nThen there is **nothing left ungoverned**.\n\nThe Sage’s governance of the world—\n**Better to do nothing than to act,**\nAnd even better to **act without acting**.\n\nIn transforming the people and establishing customs—\n**Better to transform than to influence,**\nAnd even better to **let them rest in harmony without disturbance**.\n\nThus, **Yao and Shun**, with **reverent self-restraint and flowing robes**,\nBrought **the Four Quarters into order**—\nWhat **principle of transformation** was this?\n\nIt was simply:\n**The ruler’s lack of scheming made the people still,**\n**The ruler’s lack of desire made the people upright,**\n**The ruler’s lack of greed made the people settled.**\n\nOtherwise, **busy and agitated**,\nThey believe they are **benefiting the people and removing their hardships**,\nYet **they do not realize how greatly they disturb them**.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The people originally do not contend—*\n*Yet the ruler provokes contention.*\n*The people originally are not greedy—*\n*Yet the ruler’s greed incites them.*\n*The people originally have no thoughts, no desires—*\n*Yet the ruler leads with strange arts, licentious cleverness,*\n*Gay clothing, and fine foods.\"*\n\nHow could they **not contend, not be greedy, have no cravings, no desires**?\n\nIf one **cultivates the self and rectifies the heart**,\n**Serene and unadorned, indifferent to all things**,\nAnd **does not hold virtue and ability in high regard**,\nThen the people **will naturally be at ease and not contend**.\n\nIf one **does not prize hard-to-obtain goods as noble**,\nThen the people **will value modesty and shame**,\nAnd **will not steal**.\n\nMoreover, the **arenas of sound, color, wealth, and profit** are many—\nFor the eyes, **see nothing, desire nothing**,\nAnd **each finds their own natural ease**—\nThen the **empty, responsive, lively spirit**\n**Naturally remains ever-present and undisturbed**.",

      "translated_text": "This matter is not beyond human capacity—\nOnly the Sage shuts out ear and eye,\nSevers all private inclinations,\nEmbraces the One to empty the heart.\nWhen the heart is empty, the elixir’s source is refined.\n\nThus, he gathers the **Dao’s luminous yang-qi** from heaven and earth,\nTo transform the yin-essence,\nDay by day, month by month,\nUntil the yin-essence naturally vanishes\nAnd the yang-qi flourishes—\nFilling the belly to preserve the form,\nThis is **congealing the body with the Way**,\n**prolonging life with technique**—\nThe very method of transcending death and escaping birth.\n\nMoreover, by focusing the qi to attain supreme softness,\nLike an infant’s feeble strength,\nUnable to grasp anything—\nThough supremely soft,\nYet when it moves, it is firm.\nObserve its vast and deep, towering and surging—\nTruly it can encompass heaven and earth with ease.\nAll knowing and desiring—\nWhere has it gone?\n\nThe Sage cultivates himself thus.\nAnd with this, he governs the world—\nWithin himself, no knowledge, no desire—\nNot only do the foolish wander in muddled confusion,\nIn harmony with the silent and tranquil heaven,\nBut even the clever and wise scholars,\nWho daily boast of their talents and rely on their intelligence,\nFearful only of failing to excel—\nNow, serene and indifferent, they abandon their private knowledge,\nReturning to primordial simplicity.\nThis is *able but does not act*—\nNot because they cannot, but because they dare not.\n\nYet, though born between heaven and earth,\nOne cannot escape the void\nAnd stand apart from all things—\nThere must be the Way of human relationships and daily practice.\nHow then can one *not* act?\n\nBut if one follows its natural course,\nActing without contrivance—\nThough one acts, it remains non-action—\nJust as heaven acts without speaking yet transforms all,\nAnd the seasons proclaim their teachings without command;\nThe Emperor governs without action,\nWhile ministers administer the affairs.\nAction is its trace,\nNon-action is its essence.\nThus, seated in majesty, the world rejoices in peace—\nAh, how splendid!\n\nThe Way is ever plain,\nNot vaunting novelty,\nNot prizing strangeness.\nWhen a state honors the virtuous—\nThis is a noble thing,\nYet if one boasts of it,\nThen the virtuous remain virtuous,\nBut the unworthy will also feign virtue.\nEven the virtuous may reject what is rejected,\nWhile the unworthy reject what is virtuous—\nThus, contention arises.\nEach side proclaims its own merits,\nMutually supporting factions,\nAnd the world becomes troubled.\n\nWhen a state manages finances—\nThis is a common practice,\nYet if rare goods and distant treasures are prized,\nThe people will scale mountains and cross seas,\nRisking peril and danger,\nUndeterred by toil or fear for life,\nTo gather and present them to the court.\nWhen they fail to obtain them,\nThey resort to every scheme—\nEven theft and robbery are not shunned.\n\nAs for clothing and food—\nThese are daily necessities,\nYet if one demands exquisite delicacies\nAnd fine silks,\nSeeing what is desirable and desiring it—\nWhen will extravagance cease?\n\nThus, the Sage values the inner over the outer,\nMust empty the heart to nourish the spirit,\nFill the belly to nourish the qi,\nSo that spirit and qi merge as one,\nFlowing harmoniously through the body—\nSmooth, relaxed, and joyful,\nAnd the will grows weak.\nMoreover, the spirit steadies like a mountain,\nThe qi flows like a spring,\nAnd the bones grow strong.\nEver holding to the One,\nEver guarding the Center—\nNot only is one’s own desire and thought extinguished,\nBut even the clever and wise,\nMoved by this, transform themselves,\nDaring not to act arbitrarily.\n\nSome say: *If one acts, there will be chaos and criticism;\nIf one does not act, there will be purity but scorn.*\nBetween action and non-action—\nThis is difficult indeed.\n\nYet to act in accordance with principle,\nNot presumptuously—\nAction and non-action are equal.\nThus, Confucius praised Shun:\n*\"He who governs by non-action—\nIs this not Shun?\"*\n\n**Chapter Four: Blending with the Dust**\n\nThe Way is boundless yet applied—\nSometimes not full,\nDeep like the source of all things.\nIt dulls the sharp,\nUnravels the tangled,\nBlends its light,\nMerges with the dust.\nMysterious—\nAs if it exists.\nI do not know whose child it is,\nResembling the Emperor before the beginning.\nThe Emperor—\nThe Supreme Sovereign.\nThe beginning—\nThe beginningless beginning.\n\nWhat is the Way?\nThe Great Harmony, one breath,\nFilling heaven and earth,\nIts measure encompassing the cosmos,\nIts spirit permeating past and future,\nIts virtue extending to all lands and nations.\nFrom embryonic to born, from wet to dry,\nFrom flying to creeping, from moving to still—\nThere is nowhere it is not.\n\nHow vast is the Way?\n\nYet in its essence,\nEmpty and boundless,\nFormless and void—\nIf unseen, it seems excessive;\nWhen it manifests in use,\nIt is harmonious and embraced—\nApplied here, it fits;\nPlaced there, it is appropriate.\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"Left, left—nothing is unsuited;\nRight, right—nothing is lacking.\"*\nTruly like rivers flowing to the sea,\nYet the sea does not overflow.\nIs this not the fundamental principle of all things?\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"The virtue of ghosts and spirits—\nIt rests upon all things without omission.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Speak of small things without exaggeration,\nSpeak of great things without omission.\"*\nIts vast and deep—\nTruly there is an inexhaustible mystery.\n\nThe Way is so difficult to describe—\nHow then shall later generations cultivate it?\n\nThe Most High, compassionate toward ordinary people,\nPoints to its essence:\nOrdinary people cannot enter the Way\nBecause the clever and wise,\nRelying on their talents,\nAct arbitrarily,\nThus blocking the luminous spirit\nAnd failing to see.\n\nNow, to cultivate the Way,\nOne must know that cleverness and wisdom\nAre demons that obstruct the path.\nThus, one must discard intelligence,\nDim the brightness,\nSet aside private perceptions of ear and eye,\nReturning to primordial chaos,\nAnd extinguish all arrogance of talent,\nAll reliance on cleverness,\nAll haughtiness toward others—\nThen the human heart dies,\nAnd the Dao-heart is born.\nKnowledge is extinguished,\nAnd wisdom shines forth.",

      "translated_text": "The ancient scholars said: Those with cleverness and talent are not to be feared—only those who sink deeply into the Way, purify the heart, and observe its principles are truly formidable. Is this not the truth?\n\nPractitioners must primarily focus on calming the spirit, refining thoughts, reducing desires, and clarifying the heart. Yet how can one tame the restless mind—awareness, thought, and calculation—where foul and false impulses surge like tangled silk? Before one thought subsides, another arises; before one reflection fades, another emerges. I must exhort and encourage myself, granting myself both leniency and resolution—like unraveling chaotic threads, I must trace their origins and straighten them; like clearing overgrown vines, I must uproot them and level the ground. Only then do the entanglements dissolve, and the celestial sovereign remains ever serene.\n\nYet this is but the practice of solitary stillness—still far from thriving in tumultuous places. If one can only be still and not move, it remains a rootless study. One must also reflect in stillness, but when thrust into bustling crowds, one must be especially vigilant! In all things, yield precedence to others, place yourself last, exalt others above, and willingly submit below. Thus, you will neither clash with the world nor contend with people.\n\nMoreover, men delight in the same while loathing the different—this is the common nature of the world. I must only follow the current, align with their kind, and harmonize with them. Though I possess a luminous and upright heart, I will never display its edges. I must only intuitively grasp its mechanisms, subtly uphold its essence—cherishing those who agree, tolerating those who differ. Hence, the man of Lu who hunted deer, and Confucius himself who hunted deer. In ancient times, when the Great Way was yet unclear, all sages blended with the vulgar to avoid harm.\n\nAgain, observe the Sixth Patriarch after receiving the robe and bowl—though his enlightenment was complete, its subtleties remained unexhausted. Thus, he lingered in the world, dwelling in Huìjì Mountain, living among hunters with unfeigned ease, escaping calamity. Had he not harmonized with the dust and blended with the mundane, how could he have preserved his life?\n\nThrough dynamic and static cultivation, ever-adapting with expedient means, the originally pure, still, and luminous essence naturally abides within. Yet it is not a fixed attainment—if it were fixed, it would not be the Way. If it had a place or abode, it would not be the Way. A single pulse of luminous spirit flickers beneath the golden court. What is this Way?\n\nIt arises before Heaven and Earth, mingling within the void. I know not whence it comes, nor whither it goes—whose child is it? The *Classic* says: *\"There is a primal thing, indistinctly formed, born before Heaven and Earth.\"* Is this not the profound mystery of the Way?\n\nWhat was before the Emperor? Nothing but the undifferentiated chaos, the indistinct *Hóngmáng*, a single breath of emptiness. When the One gave rise to myriad transformations and all things returned to spring, the Way dispersed through Heaven, Earth, and all beings—yet it remains inscrutable. Those who seek to illuminate the Way’s essence must perceive it in the moment when Heaven and Earth are on the verge of unfolding, when the unfurled suddenly unfurls, and measure it. Then they grasp the Way’s origin, and their practice will not lack foundation.\n\nThe Most High sketches the Way’s form for all to see, teaching those who seek the Great Way to first recognize its source. To seek the source, one must first purge deceit from the heart and preserve sincerity, beginning with humble, gradual cultivation. Over time, one attains the realm of divine transformation, realizing that the Way’s essence dwells perpetually within one’s nature, never leaving the embrace.\n\nOne must discern its traces in stillness, using cultivation, reflection, and preservation to safeguard true nature—neither overwhelming others with arrogance nor confusing the mind with excess. This is what Zhāng Zǐ called \"liberating oneself from private desires.\"\n\nPiercing the clouds, one beholds the blue sky; severing the vines, one reveals the true face. Yet when interacting with others, some bury their light, blending with the dust; some flaunt their talents or abilities; others assume the guise of recluse, displaying lofty detachment. History shows many who, through such displays, invited disaster and ruin—great harm to the Way. Like the Han dynasty’s imprisonment of scholars or the Jin dynasty’s persecution of the \"pure currents,\" though rooted in petty treachery, it also stemmed from ignorance of the sage’s art of self-preservation.\n\nIf one blends with the vulgar, harmonizes with the world, and mingles with the dust like the *lingzhī* among common grasses or the phoenix flying with common birds—unnoticed yet fragrant, unseen yet exalted—then, through such concealment and nurturing, the still and eternal Way manifests indistinctly between the brows: present yet not present, with form yet without form.\n\nAs the *Zhōngyōng* says: *\"The movements of Heaven are soundless and odorless.\"* Truly profound! What else could be before the Emperor?\n\n---\n**Chapter Five: Not Knowing to Uphold the Middle**\n\nHeaven and Earth are not kind—they treat all things as sacrificial dogs.\nThe sage is not kind—they treat the people as sacrificial dogs.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet unyielding, moving yet ever producing.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—better to uphold the Middle.\n\nThe ceaseless generation and transformation between Heaven and Earth, its unrestrained motion, is entirely governed by this primal *qi*, sustaining all within. It supports Heaven above, Earth below, and connects with all beings, leaving nothing outside its sway.\n\nWhen this *qi* is undifferentiated and vast, governing all things in orderly harmony, it is called *lǐ* (principle).\nWhen it flows boundlessly, encompassing all things in its transformative circulation, it is called *qi*.\nThe unity of *lǐ* and *qi* is called *rén* (virtue/power).\n\nThus, the ancient scholars said: *\"The virtuous one, with all human desires purified, allows Heaven’s principle to flow freely—without a trace of artificial contrivance.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "ly,\nThus blocking the luminous spirit\nAnd failing to see.\n\nNow, to cultivate the Way,\nOne must know that cleverness and wisdom\nAre demons that obstruct the path.\nThus, one must discard intelligence,\nDim the brightness,\nSet aside private perceptions of ear and eye,\nReturning to primordial chaos,\nAnd extinguish all arrogance of talent,\nAll reliance on cleverness,\nAll haughtiness toward others—\nThen the human heart dies,\nAnd the Dao-heart is born.\nKnowledge is extinguished,\nAnd wisdom shines forth.",

      "translated_text": "It is also said: *\"To generate and transform is called virtue/power.\"*\n\nIn essence, the virtuous one is like the *rén* (virtue/power) of wood—its generative principle and *qi* are fully present.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate all things, the Sage nourishes all people—none of this is achieved without the *lǐ* (principle) and *qi* flowing through them. How could it be merely a matter of outward actions?\n\nThus, the Supreme Sage spoke to elucidate the Dao: *\"If Heaven and Earth lacked this vital generative *qi*, and only had the teachings of spring, summer, autumn, winter, cold, heat, warmth, and coolness to circulate and regulate, then all things would have no foundation to draw upon—how could *qi* be received, how could form be established? They would be regarded as lightly as straw dogs, utterly unworthy of regard, only to be seen gradually worn away.*\n\n*If the Sage lacked this true primordial essence, and relied solely on ministers and officials, decrees, and legal codes to instruct the common people, then the rural masses would have no means of enlightenment—how could people be transformed, how could families be sustained? Truly, they would be treated as contemptibly as straw dogs, utterly indifferent to their plight, only to see them gradually crushed.*\n\n*Yet how is it that Heaven and Earth, though without intent, encompass all things within their wind, clouds, rain, and dew? How is it that the Sage, though silent, assists and completes all things, and all take delight within the world? It is evident that both Heaven and Earth and the Sage rely on this primal *qi*, permeating among the people and all things—though there may be exploitation, there is also generation; though there may be coercion, there is also moral cultivation. It is precisely the apparent lack of virtue/power in Heaven, Earth, and the Sage that reveals their ultimate virtue/power.*\n\n*If people do not recognize the Sage, let them observe Heaven and Earth: above, it floats as Heaven; below, it condenses as Earth. Within, it is empty yet luminous, boundless yet without obstruction—nothing more than an opening and closing, like the bellows’ endless breath and the flute’s resonant flow, vast and unrestrained. When it is empty and without form, it follows the *qi*’s rise and fall, unyielding yet flexible. When it moves and becomes sound, it responds to the transformations of all things, ever producing the extraordinary.*\n\n*To observe Heaven and Earth is to see the bellows and flute. How could the Sage be any different?*\n\n*Scholars who uphold the Middle and embrace the One, empty yet without trace, vast yet without end—when they conceal it deeply, its manifestation is boundless. Compared to those who fill halls with speech and rooms with doctrine, the difference is as vast as heaven and earth. The former sets teachings by speech, exhausting them in instruction—how could it compare to treasuring our essence, enriching our *qi*, wandering beyond form, and letting *qi* circulate through every pore?*\n\n*Truly, the study of the Middle is the essential path to cultivating the self. This is the primal *qi*—cultivating the self lies here, governing the world lies here. Beyond this, so-called institutions and laws are but the traps and snares for catching fish and rabbits. Fish and rabbits must rely on traps and snares to be obtained, yet to say they cannot be caught without them is wrong, and to say the traps and snares *are* the fish and rabbits is equally wrong.*\n\n*The Great Dao is like supplementing yin with yang—short steps forward, long steps back; the small return of jade nectar, the great return of golden nectar—all are but traps and snares for catching fish and rabbits. If one mistakenly takes them for the source of the Dao, even a hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand miles of deviation.*\n\n*Only this primal *qi*—silent, odorless, formless, the shared generative *qi* of Heaven, Earth, and all beings—must be sought by the scholar in cultivation. Only then will they not engage in empty refining. Otherwise, refining essence, *qi*, spirit, and emptiness are all studies without foundation. Even if practiced from childhood, one will remain unaccomplished to old age.*\n\n*The Supreme Sage teaches one to focus on the Middle: the key lies in the bellows and flute—students must explore this themselves! The phrase *\"not virtue/power\"* in this chapter is rhetorical.*\n\n**Chapter Six: The Unending Spirit of the Valley**\nThe unending Spirit of the Valley is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nEnduring yet unexhausted, its use is effortless.\n\nCultivation is but this: because humans have a body, *qi* and nature are constrained ahead, desires obscure behind—like pure gold and fine jade, originally without flaw, yet when plunged into mud, the finest gold loses its purity, the finest jade its luster. Thus, to restore their original state, one must employ the force of washing and the skill of polishing.\n\nThe Supreme Sage instructs the starting point of cultivation: *\"The Spirit of the Valley does not die.\"* What is the Spirit of the Valley? A mountain cave is called a valley, speaking of its emptiness; unrestrained transformation is called spirit, speaking of its vitality. \"Not dying\" means ever-awake and unobscured.\n\nIf one can nourish this empty, vital, and unobscured body as the foundation, then cultivation becomes easy. Yet it is formless and shadowless, impossible to grasp—only through the seen and heard can one glimpse its traces.\n\nThe ancients said: *\"To make the Spirit of the Valley never die, one must establish the foundation in the Mysterious Female.\"* Why is it called Mysterious? Mysterious is Heaven. Why is it called Female? Female is Earth. Heaven and Earth unite, and the Mysterious Female emerges; the Mysterious Female emerges, and opening-closing is complete. Between them, one ascends and one descends, one goes and one returns, revolving within the void—this is the gate of the Mysterious Female.\n\nConfucius said, *\"The *Kàn* and *Kūn* are the gate of the *Yì*.\"* Is this not true?\n\nThis gate is the path of yin and yang, the realm of Heaven and Earth’s transformation, the place where all things originate.

      "translated_text": "「To cultivate the elixir (*dàn*) and achieve the Dao/Way of eternal life and prolonged vision, one must not abandon this gate of the Mysterious Female—there is no other path.\n\nWhat else could be the root of Heaven and Earth? When practitioners (*xiūshì*) hang the curtain and observe with contemplation, in the state of ignorance and chaos, they must extinguish the mundane mind (*fánxīn*). Suddenly, with one awakening, the Dao/Way-mind (*dàoxīn*) is born.\n\nWhat is called \"stillness\" is the Original Spirit (*yuánshén*), and what is called \"movement\" is the True Intention (*zhēnyì*). Within this, the *tāixī* breath stirs—do not rigidly cling to the *dāntián* (elixir field); instead, observe its ascent and descent, its coming and going, its leisurely and lively flow, and one attains the true *tāixī* breath.\n\nThe ancients said: *\"To emerge from the Mysterious and enter the Female\"*—this is neither the original face of the self nor the true face of the self. Only in this space of emerging and entering does the marvelous *dì* (truth/essence) reside, which is the *qí* and *líng* (emptiness and responsiveness) of the Dao/Way.\n\nThe True Yin and True Yang, manifesting as the *qi* of True Unity (*zhēnyī*), are the essence here. The root of Heaven and Earth—could it lie beyond this?\n\nIt must be known that the Spirit of the Valley (*gǔshén*) is the principle (*lǐ*) of the Supreme Ultimate (*tàijí*); the Mysterious Female is the *qi* of yin and yang. In the preheaven (*xiāntiān*) state, principle and *qi* were originally one; in the postheaven (*hòutiān*) state, principle and *qi* cannot be spoken of together.\n\nThose who seek the Dao/Way must not indulge in a single moment of agitation or neglect a single thought. Only by borrowing the void of the Mysterious Female to nurture the emptiness and responsiveness of the Valley Spirit—neither clinging nor rejecting, neither forgetting nor aiding—can one attain it.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Endless as if it exists, use it without strain.\"* The Great Dao/Way is formless yet gives birth to Heaven and Earth; the Great Dao/Way is nameless yet brings forth all things.\n\nThe Sage, embodying the Dao/Way while appearing formless and manifesting the Dao/Way while appearing empty, reveals this most hidden and subtle essence as the Valley Spirit. The Valley Spirit—this God of the Void Valley—when questioned, seems to answer; when responded to, echoes like a sound—this is immortality (*bùsǐ*).\n\nIn the human body, it is the unobscured essence of this emptiness and responsiveness. Since humans lost their innate Heavenly conscience (*tiānhuì*), the Valley Spirit has long been submerged and obscured!\n\nLater practitioners, wishing to preserve the Valley Spirit eternally and maintain its emptiness and responsiveness, consider it the foundation of the Golden Elixir (*jīndān*) and the root of the Dao/Way of transcendence (*xiāndào*), yet they revolve in vain without a handle.\n\nOnly by seeking the Dao/Way through the interplay of *wu* (non-being) and *yǒu* (being), observing the marvelous and the subtle, can one begin. When being and non-being are balanced, the marvelous and subtle open together, and the Mysterious Female stands revealed.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"This orifice is not an ordinary orifice,\nHeaven and Earth together form it.\nIt is called the God-Spirit Hole (*shénqìxué*),\nWithin it lies the *Kàn* and *Lǐ* essence (*kānlí jīng*).\n\"* Only when essence (*jīng*), *qi*, and spirit (*shén*) are fused into one does it become the marvelous orifice of being and non-being, the gate of life and death.\n\nOtherwise, it remains an ordinary orifice, lacking the true One Primordial *qi* (*yīyuán zhēnzǎi*). When empty, it falls into coarse void; when solid, it is bound by form—both are not the body of emptiness and responsiveness.\n\nOnly this gate of the Mysterious Female—neither empty nor solid, yet both empty and solid—holds the true being that cannot be spoken of. Stillness is formless; movement has manifestations. Stillness is not the root of Heaven and Earth; movement is not the origin of all things.\n\nOnly where stillness and movement intersect is the place of the *Kàn* and *Lǐ* reversal, the realm of the Moon and Sun’s interplay—this is the true root of Heaven and the womb of Earth.\n\nWhen the student reaches the true Mysterious and true Female, with each ascent and descent—this *qi* condenses into nature (*xìng*), disperses into emotions (*qíng*)—from the state of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, the *dharma* (phenomena/manifestations) emerge.\n\nKnowing this orifice, the entire Dao/Way of immortality and transcendence is exhausted here.\n\n*\"Endless as if it exists\"*—this makes clear that nourishment must be prolonged, and only then will the *tāixī* breath stir and move.\n*\"Use it without strain\"*—this means that extraction and replenishment have their proper times, and the *fǔhuǒ* (alchemical fire) must not be recklessly added or diminished.\n\nIf humans follow the natural Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth, then the Golden Elixir will be attained.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven Endures, Earth Lasts**\nHeaven endures, Earth lasts.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can endure and last is that they do not generate themselves—thus they can eternally generate.\n\nTherefore, the Sage places his body after his body, yet his body comes first; he externalizes his body, yet his body remains. Is this not because he has no selfishness?\n\nOnly because he has no selfishness can he fulfill his selfishness. The *qi* of Heaven and Earth flows boundlessly and eternally, enduring countless eons without exhaustion—all because of the silent operation of the true One Primordial Sovereign (*yuánzhě*) within them. Thus Heaven and Earth endure and last without end.\n\nIn generating and nurturing all things, in prolonging the lives of the myriad peoples, they do so without ceasing—yet Heaven and Earth have never been insufficient. Thus the *qi*-mechanism (*qìjī*) endures eternally without wear.\n\nThe Supreme Sage says, *\"Heaven endures, Earth lasts\"*—is this not true?\n\nYet why can Heaven and Earth endure and last? It is because they do not generate themselves. If they had a self-generating mind, then Heaven and Earth would have emotions, and Heaven too would age.\n\nOnly by not having self-generation can they generate all things, and by generating all things, their own generation never ceases. Thus the generation of all things is the generation of Heaven and Earth—this is called eternal generation.\n\nThe common people are mostly ignorant of this principle of generation, seeking death instead of life, seeking swift death instead of eternal life. They drown in the fields of power and wealth, sink in the depths of sound, color, profit, and gain.\n\nThey constantly calculate, endlessly scheme—before a few years pass, their essence is exhausted, their *qi* weakened, their vitality scattered, their spirit lost. They toil through countless hardships yet struggle to enjoy even one lifetime.\n\nSeeking life while actually hastening death—how can this be lamented enough!\n\nThus the Sage follows Heaven and models Earth, refusing to chase after power and wealth, yet also not greedily pursuing the arts of prolonging life and increasing longevity. Only the Great Dao/Way comes first.\n\nHe clears the field of his heart, purifies it, and meticulously cultivates the root of his life (*mìngdì*). Whatever means of nourishing the body or refining the form exist, he does not spare time to contrive them.\n\nIn the end, his virtue (*dé*) is established, and none of his kind surpasses him; his name is made, and later generations still look up to his form.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Endless as if it exists, use it without strain.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Sage is not one who neglects his own body while it thrives, nor who forsakes his own body while it yet remains. Truly, he far surpasses those who selfishly harm their own lives a hundredfold.\n\nYet the Sage is not one who feigns emotions or stands apart for show. Since ancient times, simplicity and tranquility have been his virtues—clear and pure in heart, never floating with the crowd nor clinging to form. He stands firm in great impartiality, like Heaven and Earth in their boundless generosity.\n\nMortals are often self-seeking, burdened with cares; the Sage holds no private thoughts, his spirit bright and detached beyond all things. A single radiant essence of emptiness and boundless void, ever-shining yet never dimmed.\n\nWere it but a mortal frame of flesh and blood, a stinking skin-bag, constantly fretted over day and night—how could it ever remain whole and not decay, enduring and not perish? It is only through his impartiality that the Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth, shines like the sun and moon, and yet fulfills his own purpose.\n\nLater seekers of the Dao/Way, desiring their bodies to be immortal and their spirits unbroken, though they toil in austerity, cast off defilements, and refine themselves through long practice—naturally pure and clear, another realm of Heaven and Earth, beyond worldly life and death—how could such joy be surpassed?\n\nHeaven and Earth speak not; they rely solely on the primal *qi* of unity, circulating effortlessly between them. Thus they renew endlessly, their vital force never ceasing. Because Heaven and Earth endure eternally, they remain ever fresh across the ages.\n\nThe Sage harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, nurturing the *qi* of Great Unity, returning to the primal truth of chaos. In seclusion, his virtue becomes sublime; in action, it becomes the Way of the Sage-King.\n\nWhat are the words of those who speak of self-cultivation? They seek only lonely mountains and silent sitting, never touching the affairs of men. And those who claim to govern the world? They expend all their energy and effort, their entire being entangled in calculations for others!\n\nSuch men cling to one extreme or another, each to their own private ends. They are not those who are still in quietude, nor those who act with purpose and clarity.\n\nThe Sage in adversity remains pure and untainted, his true form steadfast as mountains and rivers. In prosperity, he benefits all, his mortal form as light as a fleeting title.\n\nWhen his name is known throughout the cosmos and his body stands alone before all ages—when his virtue covers the world and his essence persists beyond this life—is it not because he held nothing private?\n\nThe student who casts off all selfishness, empties the illusions of form, and forever escapes the roots of dust—his accumulated virtue will dwell in the mortal world, and his ascension will endure in Heaven and Earth. To reject self-interest and yet attain true longevity is as different from the worldly as the heavens from the mud.\n\nWho can truly abandon the allure of external desires?\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Virtue is Like Water**\n\nThe supreme virtue is like water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\ndwelling where others find revulsion,\nthus approaching the Dao/Way.\n\nIts place is humble, its heart deep,\nits words trustworthy, its governance wise,\nits actions effective, its movements timely.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\ndoes it suffer no blame.\n\nThe Great Dao/Way has no other mystery—\nonly the union of spirit and *qi*,\nreturning to the boundless *Tai Ji*,\nthe single breath of life given by parents at birth.\n\nIf one does not attend to the Dao/Way,\nthen spirit and *qi* are divided,\nlike lead and mercury scattered—\nfor water and fire are thus separated.\n\nMencius said: *\"The people are not nourished by water and fire, they cannot live.\"*\nThis applies both to daily needs\nand to the essentials of cultivation.\n\nSometimes fire warms water, and true yang manifests;\nsometimes water sustains fire, and sweet dew arises.\nThe marvels of water and fire\nare truly beyond measure.\n\nYet water and fire share the same essence—\nspeak of water, and fire is known.\n\nWater’s nature is to descend;\nthe Dao/Way values humility.\nThus the Sage of supreme virtue\nis even-tempered, his will gentle and yielding,\nletting all things flourish in their own time—\nnone escape his beneficence.\n\nIn truth, his virtue covers the world yet he knows not of it,\nhis actions fill the cosmos yet he claims them not.\nOnly by following Heaven and Earth’s natural order,\nfulfilling the place of all things,\ndoes he remain without conflict—\ntruly like water in its boundless nourishment.\n\nNot only this—\nall things prefer clarity to turbidity,\nelevation to descent.\nWater cleanses all things yet keeps itself impure,\nserves others with elevation yet humbles itself below.\nAh, water! Water!\nHow perfectly it mirrors the Dao!\n\nThe Sage’s nature is one with water’s—\ngentle, not rigid,\nhumble in self-giving.\nWhat others cannot endure, the Sage accepts as ever-present;\nwhat others most abhor, the Sage bears with ease.\nThus he harms none, nor does he contend with any.\nNone but the Sage of the Dao/Way can do so.\nHence it is said: *\"Dwelling where others find revulsion, he approaches the Dao.\"*\n\nWhat the Dao/Way offers to oneself\nis to occupy one’s natural place and move without hindrance.\nEven in matters of gain or loss,\ncalamity or death—\nwhat others cannot bear—\nthe Sage of the Dao/Way views all with equal measure.\n\nThe gentleman speaks of principle, not *qi*;\ndiscusses nature, not fate—\nonly the cultivation of virtue and self-reflection matter.\n\nStill, virtue arises from unity,\nand its refinement follows many paths.\nHow could it be without a guiding source,\nvast and boundless,\nyet grounded in an ultimate foundation?\n\nThere must be a realm of supreme goodness,\nwhere it rests without shifting,\nonly then can it grow subtly yet steadily,\nas Heaven’s truth fills the day,\nand human desires fade.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"The mountain stands firm, its back unyielding, yet it does not harm its own body. It moves within its courtyard, yet none see its person.\"*\nThis is the Sage’s humble dwelling.\n\nTo dwell in peace is to draw from its depth.\nTo gaze inward at his heart—\nempty, yet holding nothing—\ndeep as the abyss, yet deeper still.",

*\"resting at supreme goodness\"* (止于至善),\nfinding his place of ease,\nand then all his actions conform to proper measure.\n\nFor in every moment and place,\nthere is no slightest flaw or

the morning and refining it in the evening,\nthe primordial essence fills one’s body inside and out,\nthen one’s body stands firm as a wall a thousand *zhang* high,\none’s mind clear as an autumn moon in a frigid pool.\nThe external *gonads* shrink like those of a child,\nand thus the realm of complete impermeability is attained.\n\nAt this time, when essence is full within the body,\nit is unwise to further apply fire elixirs—\none must stop the fire and instead\nbe blank and unaware, hazy and unknowing,\nsuddenly forgetting the state of essence-fullness\nas the true attainment.\n\nIf one clings to fullness without ceasing,\none risks the peril of spilled elixirs and overturned crucibles—\nit is better to cease early than to suffer harm.\n\nWhen the *qi* is yet insufficient,\none must boil and refine it a thousandfold,\nstirring the martial and civil *divine fires*,\nto forge the primordial *one-yuan true qi* forth,\nas the basis for prolonging life.\nWhen the mundane *qi* is fully refined,\nit transforms into a single piece of pure Yang—\nmost vast, most resolute—\npenetrating the very marrow of one’s sinews and bones,\nvigorous as a dragon, fierce as a tiger.\nWhat greater refinement and sharpness could there be?\n\nI must focus the *qi* to attain softness,\njust as an infant is pure and ignorant.\nOnly then can one long preserve the *qi*,\nreaching the state where both form and spirit are wondrous,\nand one is truly united with the Dao.\nIf one clutches sharpness without rest,\none risks the calamity of flames consuming the fields—\nhow could one expect to preserve it long?\n\nThus, one sees from human affairs that the Way of Heaven is known:\nIn spring, warmth prevails;\nby summer, the scorching sun commands,\nand the gentle warmth is gone.\nIn autumn, coolness descends;\nby winter, the cold dominates,\nand the western winds vanish.\n\nWhen things grow and their purpose is fulfilled,\nwhen the season runs its course and its name is complete,\nHeaven and Earth withdraw and conceal themselves,\nto nurture the virtue of Yang harmony.\nIf winter’s cold were to mix with spring’s warmth,\nand summer’s heat were to blend with autumn’s chill,\nthen the Way of Heaven would be inverted,\nthe seasons would stray from their proper order,\nand the failure to withdraw when achievement is complete\nwould breed perverse *qi*—\nits harm to mortals would be great.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When achievement is complete and name is fulfilled, one withdraws—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\"*\n\nIf Heaven is thus,\nhow much more so for mortals?\nIn history, wise

swiftly;\nwhen refined, one must know to stop and suffice.\nIf one still holds to the fullness of the heart,\none risks ruin and humiliation one day.\"*\n\nIt is clear the Dao has no end,\nachievement knows no limit—\nwhat use is this pretended sufficiency?\n\nIn history, many cultivators\nsuffered calamities—\ntheir lives cut short, their families ruined—\nall because they did not know\nthe Way of

one’s own excessive display.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Careless hoarding invites theft,\nand primping invites licentiousness\"—\ntruly self-inflicted.\n\nWhy then should those who are self-satisfied\nexpect to avoid harm?\n\nI wish those who come after me:\nbefore making progress, to follow the Way in practice,\nwhen deeply cultivated, to stop and not apply the fire—\nonly then may one avoid the calamity of burning one’s body.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Focusing Qi to Attain Softness**\nTo bear the *yingshen* (vital soul) and embrace unity,\ncan one avoid separation?\nTo focus the *qi* to attain softness,\ncan one be like an infant?\nTo purge and clear the profound vision,\ncan one be without blemish?\nTo love one’s country and govern the people,\ncan one be without action?\nTo open and close the Heavenly Gate,\ncan one be without yielding?\nTo be clear and all-pervasive,\ncan one be without knowing?\n\nTo *nourish* and *cherish*,\nto *nourish* without possession,\nto act without reliance,\nto grow without slaughtering—\nthis is called *mysterious virtue*.\n\nThis chapter begins by speaking of the Dao of refining essence into *qi*.\nOnce the essence and *qi* are within the body,\none must maintain a single heart and single virtue,\nand not allow them to stray even slightly.\nIf they stray, the three treasures—\nessence, *qi*, and spirit—\nwill scatter and not reunite,\nunable to attain the utmost,\nas the foundation for elixir refinement.\n\nThus the Supreme Sage says:\n*\"To bear the yingshen and embrace unity,\ncan one avoid separation?\"*\n\nThe *yingshen* refers to blood.\nBlood is generated by the heart,\nthe *po* (ethereal soul) is stored in the heart—\none must surely illuminate the elixir field,\nkeeping the heart unmoving,\nso that the *shen* (spirit) may flow\nfrom the sun to the moon,\nand the moon may return to pure dryness.\n\nThis arises when the heart’s Yang enters the kidney’s Yin,\nand the divine fire illuminates the blood-water.\nThough water is cold and metal is chilled,\nthe divine fire boils and simmers it,\nand it rises naturally,\nunfettered and boundless.",
      "overlap_context": "ained, one must forget the Way.\"*\nThese few words are indeed the most vital for cultivating the Dao.\n\nIf one practices the Dao and fulfills deeds,\nhaving already entered the realm of refined and vast achievement,\nyet still clings and guards it,\nboasting of superior learning and profound cultivation,\none cannot avoid the rise of arrogance and agitation,\nleading either to withdrawal and retreat\nor to contradictory and perverse actions.\n\nIf this is so,\nwhere then is the Dao?\nWhat remains of virtue?",

      "translated_text": "The Perfect Sage knows this mysterious female (玄牝) as the root of heaven and earth,\nand thus within each breath—\none inhalation, one exhalation—\nwhen the subtle Yang stirs,\nhe seizes it with a single glance,\ngrasp it with one hand,\nand directs a drop of his own mercury (己汞) to meet it,\nspinning left, drawing right,\nraising it back to the central field (中田),\ncongealing it without dispersion—\nthen he bears the *po* (魄) and returns,\nembracing unity and resting,\nwithout pause,\nand thus the true Yang flourishes,\nthe true *qi* surges.\n\nFrom this, he operates the River Vehicle (河车),\nstokes the fire from the Empty Danger Hole (虚危穴),\ndrawing it to the Tail Lock (尾闾),\nbeating the nine-layered iron drum (九重铁鼓),\nand activating the Three-Legged Golden Toad (三足金蟾),\nascending it to the crown—\nall must be done with singular focus,\nunbroken and unwavering—\nuntil it rises to the Mud Ball (泥丸),\nthe Muni’s Precious Pearl (牟尼宝珠) obtained.\nIf he does not then nourish it for a moment,\nthe Mud Ball’s Yin essence will not transform,\nhow can he achieve the fusion of lead and mercury (铅汞)?\nRefined into sweet dew divine elixir (甘露神水),\nit moistens the hundred vessels (百脉) of the body.\n\nHaving nourished the Mud Ball,\nhe next draws it down to the Lower Red Palace (下重楼),\nentering the Vermilion Court (绛宫),\nthus withdrawing the Yin symbol at noon (午退阴符).\n\nYet when stoking the fire,\none must take its vigor (刚),\nnot relying on the force of dry vigor (乾健之力),\nfor true gold cannot ascend.\nAnd when withdrawing the symbol,\none must take its gentleness (柔),\nnot employing the virtue of yielding compliance (柔顺之德),\nor the Yang lead (阳铅) will remain scattered,\nunable to subdue the mercury and forge the elixir (伏汞成丹).\nThus it is said:\n*\"Can one focus the *qi* to achieve gentleness like a newborn?\"*\n\nIts meaning instructs:\nAfter the Yin is generated at noon (阴生午后),\none must illuminate with a clear mind (一心朗照),\nletting the *qi* mechanism descend naturally,\nas it will—\nunforced and unconstrained,\nyet fully understood—\nthis is the yielding compliance of the *Kūn* hexagram (坤卦柔顺),\nthe path of the virtuous one’s cultivation (君子修行之道).\n\nWhen descending to the Vermilion Court (降宫) for nourishment,\nreturning to the Earth Vessel (土釜),\nsealing it firmly,\none must only reside in tranquility (恬淡),\nharmonizing and settling it,\nin a mere instant—\nthe breath ceases as if nonexistent,\nthe spirit’s movement seems extinguished—\nthis is the attainment of gentleness (致柔).\n\nNourished for a while,\nthe spirit and *qi* return to their roots,\nlike fire seeds in the furnace,\nlong congealed and concentrated,\nnot allowed to scatter wildly,\nnaturally the true *qi* circulates,\nturning through the body—\nthe mind at peace,\nthe limbs supple,\nas if the body of a newborn,\nfluffy and delicate,\nshowing the state of tender weakness beyond endurance (柔弱不堪任物),\nthis is sufficient proof of the elixir’s congealing (丹凝之象).\n\nFrom here, lead and mercury unite,\nwater and fire harmonize—\none must then wash the heart and purge the mind,\ncultivating the single true lead (真铅).\n\nIf the heart wanders even slightly,\nthe elixir will scatter—\nnot only will the elixir have no chance to complete,\nbut even the lead from the Water Village (水乡之铅)\nwill no longer be mine.\n\nThe *Scripture of Purity* (《清净经》) states:\n*\"The heart without its heart, things without their things.\nThe void without its void, the nonexistent without its nonexistent—\nserene and ever still,\nthus the constant quietude.\"*\nWhat flaw could there be?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Can one purify and peer into the mysteries without blemish?\"*\n\nEven if the external elixir is obtained,\ninternal illumination is not strict—\nif human desires are not yet purified,\nheavenly principles not yet refined,\nhow could a single grain of millet elixir (黍球)\nemerge empty yet complete in form (虚而成象)?\n\nWhen the elixir is within the body,\none must still preserve essence and enrich *qi*,\nto form the sacred embryo (圣胎).\n\nYet this preservation must follow nature’s course,\nthis enrichment must accord with spontaneity (自在).\nThe unforced preservation surpasses forced preservation,\nthe unconstrained enrichment surpasses constrained enrichment.\nOtherwise, clinging to preciousness,\nfew escape harm.\n\nThe elixir is primordial *qi* (先天元气),\nformless and undefined—\nwhy must it be made manifest?\nIf one seeks its traces,\none risks stirring the post-heaven fire (火动后天),\nand the great Dao of the primordial will be lost.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Can one love the people and govern the state without action?\"*\nThe people are like essence (民比精也),\nthe state like *qi* (国喻气也).\nThe key to governing lies in benevolence to love the people.\n\nEstablishing laws to govern,\nthis is but the minor gratification of a hegemon (霸者),\nfar from the king’s virtue of non-action (王者的无为而治).\nRepeatedly bright and refined (重熙累治),\nthe contest lies in action and non-action.\n\nThe path to cultivating the body:\nessence steadied is like the people at ease,\n*qi* abundant is like the state prosperous.\nRefining oneself makes essence steadied,\nnourishing directly makes *qi* abundant—\nextreme purity (浩然) and great vigor (刚大),\nfilling both realms (两间),\nas if seeing it as one’s fixed possession,\na common practice,\nnot boasting of ability,\nnot flaunting wisdom—\nmuddled and indistinct,\nas if forgetting the very act of cultivation,\nnon-action yet great action emerges.\n\nWhen the student reaches this stage,\nessence full and *qi* abundant,\nnourishing it long and steadily,\nnaturally the crown splits and the elixir ascends,\nable to ride the clouds in high flight,\nsoar over the ocean isles—\ncompared to those who formerly adhered to the strict rules,\nfocusing *qi* to achieve gentleness,\nthe difference is vast!\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Can one open and close the Heavenly Gate without duality?\"*\nThis speaks of the former days,\nwhen adjusting the spirit and nourishing the embryo (调神养胎)\ncould not avoid clinging to duality (守雌).\nNow the Yang spirit is robust and flourishing,\nfree from the mundane body,\nbursting through the Heavenly Gate,\nascending to the celestial expanse—\ntruly joyous!\n\nHow is the *qi* robust?\nAt this point, the heart is like a clear mirror,\nthe nature like still water,\nilluminating the heavens,\nlively on the earth—\nall knowledge and perception (知觉之识神)\ntransform into the void and boundless (空洞之元神).\n\nForeknowledge and foresight (前知后晓),\nburning yet dissolving (烛照糜遗),\nthis is clarity—\nthus all paths are open without contradiction.\n\nYet ever serene and ever illuminated,\nno trace of illumination or stillness remains;\never clear and ever aware,\nno thought of clarity or perception lingers.\nIt is as if all things come and are reflected,\nlike a high-hanging mirror,\nwhere nothing can hide—\nyet all must be rooted in non-action (无为),\naction as its use (有为).\n\nWhen the Yang has not yet arisen,\none accumulates essence and enriches *qi* to generate it;\nonce the Yang has arisen,\none treasures essence and enriches *qi* to store it.\nWhen later the form is retained to transform the world,\naccumulating merit and virtue—\nthough born, one does not boast of nurturing (不夸辅育之功),\nthough acting, one does not rely on effort (不恃矜持之力),\nthough long-lived, one does not depend on constraint (不假制伏之劳).",

shedding the mortal form to gain the pearl—\nthe essence lies in nothingness reaching its utmost and stillness attaining its depth,\nin embracing the Three and holding the One,\nin the hazy and indistinct, the boundless and formless.\nFrom the foundation to returning the cinnabar,\nall depends on the interplay of indistinct yet knowing,\nand of transforming the manifest from the unmanifest.\n\nThe Dao/Way originates at the beginning of **Hongmeng (鸿蒙)**,\nmixed within the void of emptiness.\nIt is unseen, unheard—\nhow then can one who practices it take hold?\nThe Sage knows the Dao/Way’s essence is formless,\nyet its function manifests in phenomena.\nThus, with the formless as substance,\nand the substantial as formless,\nthey steal the **qi** from the realm of **Hun-Dun (浑浑沌沌)**,\nand gather the spirit within the hazy and indistinct.\nTo perfect the Great Oneness of the Dao/Way,\nand to become an immortal sage forever—\n\nWhat is meant by **\"substantial yet

**Eight Trigrams (二八)** initial threads of **qi**.\n\nWhere **qi** exists without matter,\nthe Dao/Way shines forth.\nThus it is said:\n*\"When yin and yang unite, the primordial qi appears;\nwhen yin

perceive the Dao/Way;\nwithout the Dao/Way, there is no means to bear the vessels.\n\nThe **Most High (太上)** borrows the analogy of a **chariot (车)**:\nA chariot has spokes and a hub;\nthirty spokes symbolize the movement of the sun and moon,\nwhile the hub sits at the center,\npierced by all the axles.\nThe hub is hollow within,\nthe spokes gather without—\nthus it turns effortlessly.\nIf not

clay,\nkneading the clay into vessels,\nonce fired and refined,\nthey are solid without yet hollow within—\nyet for all practical purposes,\nhuman utility lies not in the clay’s substance,\nbut in the empty void.\nAs with **Tao Can (陶侃)** moving bricks,\nif not for the space within that is void and empty,\nhow could they be turned with ease?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When it is void, then the vessel’s use is realized.\"*\n\nFurther, consider building a dwelling:\nOne must carve doors and windows within it,\nand only then does light pour forth.\nOnce inside this dwelling,\nthe doors and windows seem unnecessary—\none focuses on the empty space,\nwhere one may rest one’s knees.\nThough the dwelling is formed as substance,\ntrue residence lies in its practical emptiness.\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"When it is void, then the dwelling’s use is realized.\"*\n\nFrom these three analogies observed,\nthe void is not without form as chariot, vessel, and dwelling;\nthe void is not without form as carrier, storehouse, and abode.\nYet those who dwell in the formless\nare the ones who enrich the practical use of the manifest.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The manifest is for utility, the void is for function;\nboth manifest and void\nare mutually their roots.\"*\n\nIn essence, the Dao/Way is originally void and formless—\nyet without yin and yang, it cannot be seen.\n**Qi** belongs to yin and

Dao/Way within yin and yang,\nand returning through yin and yang to the **Great Ultimate (太极)**,\ncan the primordial and later-heaven be united,\nand the Dao/Way be attained.\n\nLater alchemists who refine the elixir\nmerely ingest the manifest **qi**,\nunaware of forging the formless elixir.\nIf they wish to become immortals,\nare they not traveling south while aiming north?\n\nThe Dao/Way has no name,\nyet it is named **\"Dao/Way\"**.\nThe Dao/Way has no practice,\nyet it is called **\"practice\"**.\n\nFor the Dao/Way as a thing,\nwhen it reaches utmost void and utmost formlessness,\nonly

of all under heaven—\nwhat greater trust could there be?\n\n**Chapter XIV: The Symbol Without Symbol**\nWhat cannot be seen is called *Yī* (the tranquil);\nWhat cannot be heard is called *Xī* (the subtle);\nWhat cannot be grasped is called *Wēi* (the minute).\nThese three cannot be questioned,\nso they merge into one.\n\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nits lower depths are not dark—\nendless and nameless,\nreturning to the formless.\nThis is called the state without form,\nthe symbol without symbol—\nthe Dao of *huǎnghǔ* (vague and indistinct).\n\nPursue it, and you cannot see its head;\nfollow it, and you cannot find its tail.\nTo wield the ancient Dao\nand govern the present with it,\nto know the origins of the ancient—\nthis is called the Dao’s thread.\n\nAll things under heaven must have their order,\nonly then can one grasp the main points,\nhold the leading lines,\nand proceed without confusion.\nHow much more so for cultivating the Dao?\n\nThe source of the Great Dao is the Primal Dao-qi;\nThe root of the Great Dao is the Primal Dao-qi.\nWhat is the Primal Dao-qi?\n*The Odes* say: *\"The mandate of Heaven, serene and unceasing.\"*\n\nWhat is the root of the Great Dao?\n*The Odes* say: *\"The carriage of Heaven, without sound or scent.\"*\nWhen essence and qi unite in harmony, this is the Dao.\n\nIf cultivators recognize this guiding principle,\nand discern its subtle beginnings,\nthen by regulating emotions with wisdom,\nand fixing nature with righteousness,\nand by taking the Dao-qi of emptiness and nothingness as their foundation—\nthe path to longevity is attained.\n\nIf one takes clarity and brightness,\nlucidity and distinctness,\nas the method of cultivation,\nI fear the Dao has no true substance,\nand all efforts are in vain.\n\nThus the Supreme Sage describes the Primal Dao:\n*\"What cannot be seen is called Yī;\nWhat cannot be heard is called Xī;\nWhat cannot be grasped is called Wēi.\"*\n\nThe heart communicates with the eyes—\nthe eyes harbor the spirit.\nThe kidneys communicate with the ears—\nthe ears harbor the essence.\nThe spleen communicates with the limbs—\nthe limbs belong to the spleen,\nthe spleen belongs to earth,\nearth nurtures all things,\nand the true qi congeals within.\nThus the spirit and essence reside there.\n\nIf the eyes perceive something,\nif the ears hear something,\nif the hands act—\nthese are all the shaped, colored, sounded, and scented essence-qi of the post-heaven.\nThey can only form matter,\nnot the Dao itself.\n\nOnly when the eyes see nothing—\nthen the post-heaven wood-nature is revealed;\nOnly when the ears hear nothing—\nthen the post-heaven metal-essence is revealed;\nOnly when the hands grasp nothing—\nthen the post-heaven intent-earth is revealed.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe post-heaven water, fire, and earth\ngive rise to form;\nThe pre-heaven metal, wood, and earth\nlead to immortality.\n\nWhat is called *Yī*, *Xī*, and *Wēi*\nare all profound and mysterious,\nbeyond all reach—\ntruly, there is what cannot be exhausted.\n\nIf one can merge the five essences into one essence,\nand blend the three primal elements into one,\nthen the true essence-qi is here,\nand the natural sovereign is here as well.\n\nThus *Awakening to the True* says:\n*\"The maiden wears green robes (fire engenders water),\nthe young man wraps himself in white silk (water engenders metal).\nSee it, yet cannot use it (post-heaven water, fire, earth),\nuse it, yet cannot see it (pre-heaven metal, wood, earth).\nIn vague indistinctness we meet (blended into one),\nin boundless darkness there is change.\nIn a flash, flames rise—\nthe True Person emerges.\"*\n\nWhen cultivators know this,\nthey know the source of the Great Dao,\nand the key to cultivating it.\n\nIf they do not know its origin in emptiness and nothingness,\nbut cling to the filth of their mortal frame,\nto confused and impure spirit,\nto a generated and enlightened mind,\nand to deliberate visualizations—\nI fear their stored essence is not deep,\nand their manifestation will not be smooth.\n\nThis is the work of refining essence, qi, and spirit,\nso that it never departs from the state of *hún-dùn* (chaotic unity).\nOnce in chaotic unity,\nwith time the embryo grows long,\nand the yang-spirit is born—\nbut the methods of nurturing the embryo and fostering the spirit\nmust also be understood,\nas taught in the previous chapter:\n*\"Love the people, govern the realm,\nand practice the Dao of non-action.\"*",

extends endlessly and subtly,\ncontinuously and firmly,\nineffable and beyond deliberate action—\nreturning to the primordial state before one’s parents gave birth,\nwhere all is indistinct and nothing exists in particular.\n\nThe *Yì* says: *\"Wash the heart and retreat, hiding in the profound.\"*\nThis is its very essence!\nHence it is said: *\"Reverting to the state of nothingness.\"*\n\nThough nothingness it may be,\nyet all things under heaven—\nten thousand affairs, ten thousand beings—\narise from this void.\nThus the *Tàishàng* speaks of the *Dao*’s formless form,\nits shapeless shape—\nfor indeed, what form or shape does it possess?\nOnly a fleeting glimpse within the *huǎnghuǎng hūhū* (dimly indistinct).\n\nIf truly dimly indistinct,\nthen the *zhēnyuán* (true essence) will emerge.\nGreet its opportunity and guide it—\none sees not from where it arises,\nfor its beginning is unseen—\nfollow its *qi* and draw it forth—\none sees not where it ends,\nfor its conclusion is unmarked.\nSuch is the vastness of the *Dao*.\n\nIs this not the great *Zhōushā* (boundless space) of the *Jìnguān* (pure land),\nrefined into the finest *háománg* (hair’s tip)?\nThis *Dao*—what *Dao* is it?\nIt is the *yuánshǐ* (primordial) *qì* of *yīnqì* (one breath),\nthe true sovereign of the human body’s organs and bones.\n\nTo obtain it is to live;\nto lose it is to die.\nTo preserve it fully is to be human;\nto neglect it is to become mere matter—\nits manifestation lies only in a hair’s breadth.\n\nWhen a student of the *Dao* attains this primordial *qì*,\nharmonizing and regulating the five organs and hundred bones,\nthen their hair and nails shine with vitality,\ntheir skin and flesh grow smooth and supple—\nthis is called *\"grasp the ancient Dao,\nto govern the present with its power.\"*\n\nIf a person can recognize this primordial *qì*—\nthe very breath that gave rise to heaven and earth,\nthe unfathomable essence of antiquity—\nand take it as the guiding principle of their body,\nthe mastermind of all affairs,\nthen their foundation stands firm while their actions unfold naturally,\ntheir root is upright and their branches align in

woe unto them!\n\nThis describes the substance of the *Dao*.\nOnly those who study the *Dao* and grasp its substance\ncan have a place to begin their practice.\n\nIf the *qì* of true unity is the source of innate life and vitality,\nit cannot be compared to the later-born *jīng-qì-shén* (essence, *qi*, and spirit).\nTo perceive the life-*qì*,\none must merge the innate truth with the true essence into one,\nonly then attaining the *qì* of true unity.\n\nThough this *qì* is boundless and profound,\nits form and shape are indistinct,\nyet all things under heaven—\nthose with form and shape—\nemerge from this very formlessness and shapelessness.\nTruly, it is the framework of the great *Dao*,\nthe foundation of heaven, earth, and all beings.\n\nThe *Dao* speaks of *\"guarding the center\"* (守中),\nBuddhism of *\"contemplating emptiness\"* (观空),\nConfucianism of *\"cultivating solitude with caution\"* (慎独)—\nall share the same fundamental function.\n\nThus, from the perspective of others,\nit seems as though there is nothing to see or hear,\nyet within oneself, it is utterly clear—\nboth supremely empty and supremely real,\nboth utterly nonexistent and utterly present.\n\nHence *Zǐsī* said:\n*\"Do not reveal the hidden,\ndo not display the subtle.\"*\n\nThe scholar’s diligence in cultivating solitude\nis indeed unremitting.\n\nIn essence, the hidden and subtle realms of solitude,\nthough there may be what can be revealed or substantiated,\nthe roots of the great *Dao*\nare only profound and mysterious—\nineffable yet described,\nshapeless yet symbolized,\nultimately indistinct and tranquil.\n\nStudents of the *Dao* must,\nbefore the yang arises, await it in *huǎnghuǎng hūhū* (dimly indistinct),\nwhen the yang is already born, greet it in *huǎnghuǎng hūhū*,\nwhen the yang returns to the furnace and enters the cauldron,\nguard and nurture it in *huǎnghuǎng hūhū*—\nnever stirring the mind to deliberate enlightenment,\nso that they may never fail to attain the *Dao*’s return at any time or place.\n\nEarlier, it was said:\nWhen the yang-spirit appears,\nit illuminates heaven and penetrates earth,\nreaching the profound and subtle,\nand upon sudden enlightenment,\nthe radiant landscape is pure and natural—\nknowing yet as though unaware,\nawake yet as though unenlightened—\nhow much more so at the very start of practice,\nwhen one must not be *huǎnghuǎng hūhū* (dimly indistinct),\nbut instead quiet the mortal mind to birth the *Dao*-heart.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Subtle and Profound Penetration**\nThe ancients

wood,*\n*vast, as though an empty valley,*\n*muddy, as though turbid waters.*\n\nWho can clarify the turbid,\nletting it settle slowly into clarity?\nWho can remain still,\nyet stir for ages into life?\n\nThose who preserve this *Dao* do not wish to be full,\nthus their vessel never wears out.\nThe *Tàishàng* spoke of the *Dao*’s substance in the previous chapter;\nnow he speaks of those who embody the *Dao*.\n\nMan and the *Dao* are two yet one.\nThe *Dao* is invisible,\nyet through man, it becomes visible.\nHow can man become transcendent?\nThrough the *Dao*, he attains transcendence.\n\nWhat is the *Dao*?\nIt is the *qì* of true unity.\nThe *qì* of true unity is the *dé* (virtue/power) of the *Zhōngyōng* (Doctrine of the Mean).\n\nTo cultivate the great *Dao*, what else is there?\n*Wénwáng* (King Wen) served the *Shàngdì* (August Heaven) with utmost reverence,\nand *Kǒngzǐ* (Confucius) stood with feet drawn in,\nas though bound by a thread.\n\nThe *Dao* as *Dao*\nis nothing more than this single act of reverence.\nIf a person can hold reverence in their heart,\nnever carelessly neglecting a single thought or deed,\nis not the great *Dao* already within them?\n\nThough it is so,\nthe *Dao* has no strange wonders—\nit relies entirely on those who embody it.\nThus the *Dao* is not suspended empty in heaven and earth.\n\nHence the *Tàishàng* says:\nThe ancients who excelled in cultivation\nwere not dualistic in their actions,\nthus their birth of beings was unfathomable.\nHow profound and mysterious is their attainment!\n\n*\"Motionless yet responsive,\ncommunicating without effort.\"*\nHow supremely profound and penetrating is this!\n\nObserve their hearts—vast and boundless—\ntheir *qì*—abundant and flowing—\nnot unlike the depths of

      "translated_text": "「Initially, one merely employs the method of **lifting and nudging** (**提掇**), forbidding this point of true **qi** (**真气**) from dispersing downward, nor allowing this true **qi** to scatter among the six sense gates (**六根门头**). It is all about a single-hearted return to **fate** (**皈命**), and the five bodies (**五体**) offering sincere allegiance.\n\nWith time, one’s **true essence** (**真精**) will naturally be full and free from lustful thoughts (**不思色**).\nMay the student preserve and guard the **original essence** (**元精**), not allowing it to leak even a drop.\n\nAt first, it is difficult to always practice the **familiar Dao** (**熟道**).\nBut if one can endure again and again (**一忍再忍**), and not allow even a single thought to stir (**不许念头稍动**), within three months, the **external yang** (**外阳**) will naturally withdraw and be contained.\n\nWhen the **external yang** is withdrawn and contained,\nthen one will see that the **original essence** (**元气**) within the body is abundant,\nand the **immortal** (**长生不老**) and **transcendent** (**人仙**) will thus be attained—\nfor what is transcendence so distant after all?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Fully Returning to Itself**\n*\"When bent, it is whole; when twisted, it becomes straight. When hollowed, it overflows; when worn, it renews. When few, it suffices; when many, it confuses.\"*\nThus, the **sage** (**圣人**) embraces **Oneness** (**抱一**) as a model for the world.\n\nBy not seeing oneself, one becomes bright (**不自见故明**);\nBy not asserting oneself, one becomes evident (**不自是故彰**);\nBy not praising oneself, one attains merit (**不自伐故有功**);\nBy not boasting of oneself, one endures (**不自矜故长**).\n\nFor only by not contending does one ensure that none in the world can contend with them.\nWhat the ancients called *\"When bent, it is whole\"*—\nis this not true?\n\nIndeed, it is **whole** and **returns** to itself.\nThe essence of the **Great Dao** (**大道**) lies in reaching the **void** (**无**) while containing the **ultimate** (**至有**);\nReturning the **ultimate** to the **void** (**至无**), only then does one attain the **method of dual cultivation** (**性命双修**).\n\nFor **nature** (**性**) is fundamentally **void** (**无**), yet **void** arises from **ultimate** (**有**);\n**fate** (**命**) is fundamentally **ultimate** (**有**), yet **ultimate** arises from **void** (**无**).\nIf one clings to **void** (**虚无**), one falls into dull emptiness (**顽空**);\nIf one clings to **ultimate** (**实有**), one becomes ensnared by **forms and names** (**拘名象**).\nEven if one does not descend into false and unorthodox delusions (**妄诞不经**),\nit is still a one-sided practice (**一边之学**), ultimately unable to equal the **Great Dao** (**大道**).\n\nThe practitioner must first lay down all **ten thousand entanglements** (**万缘**), and not stain themselves with even a speck of **dust** (**纤尘**).\nWithin **Oneness** (**一**) and **having nothing** (**无所有**),\none must seek out a single spark of **life-force** (**生机**) to serve as the **elixir foundation** (**丹本**).\nThis is what the ancients called **true yang** (**真阳**), also known as **true lead** (**真铅**), or **true One-essence** (**真一之气**).\n\nThe **Supreme Sage** (**太上**) said: *\"When bent, it is whole\"*—\nmeaning that within the body’s hidden depths (**隐微**), the realm of **solitary knowing and solitary awareness** (**独知独觉**),\nthere exists a **complete, pristine, and fluid** (**浑沦完全、活泼流通**) **mechanism** (**机**).\nBy preserving and nurturing this,\nrefining and distilling it,\none can reach **elixir completion** (**丹成**) and **transcendence** (**仙就**).\n\nThe ancients likened it to the **slightest thread of yang** (**冬至一线微阳**) at the Winter Solstice,\nwhich brings forth **unceasing life** (**生生不已**).\nOr they likened it to the **first three days’ crescent moon** (**初三一弯新月**),\ngradually waxing full until the fifteenth day (**十五月圆**),\nall signifying the meaning of **wholeness through bending** (**由曲而全**).\n\nFor **bending** is **hidden** (**曲隐**), and in the hidden depths (**隐微**),\nthe **mechanism** (**机**) is subtle,\nyet its **fulfillment** (**成**) is grand.\nAs the *Zhongyong* says: *\"When bent, it can have\"* (**曲能有**), and this is indeed so.\n\nWithin the **bending** (**一曲**), all is the **essence of principle and qi** (**理气之元**);\nIn the **whole** (**全体**), all is the **refined essence of the Great Ultimate** (**太极之粹**).\nThus, *\"When bent, it is whole\"* (**曲则全**).\n\nThe **sage** (**圣人**) having discovered this **bending** (**曲**), diligently and cautiously guards it,\ncircling and containing it like a hen brooding her egg (**如鸡温卵**),\nor a dragon nurturing its pearl (**如龙养珠**).\nWith a single-hearted inward vigilance (**一心内守**), they do not allow it to be exposed externally (**不许外露**).\n\nIn time, it becomes vast as the tides (**浩浩如潮**),\nrising and ascending upward (**逆而上伸**).\nA single surge of **clear and rigid qi** (**清刚之气**) stands firm and ascends straight,\ntranscending the **sphere of sun and moon** (**日月之表**),\nencompassing the **boundaries of heaven and earth** (**天地之外**).\n\nThe *Kun* hexagram says:\n*\"When the earth reaches its utmost softness, it moves and becomes hard\"* (**坤至柔而动也刚**),\nall from the **residue of bending** (**致曲之余**),\nhidden and dormant in the **cauldron of earth** (**土釜**).\nIt accumulates until it overflows the heavens (**滔天**),\nbursting forth unstoppably (**勃不可遏**).\nSuch is its nature.\n\nMoreover, **twistedness** (**枉**) becomes **yin** (**阴**) and **softness** (**柔**), yet this is the same **qi** (**气**);\n**straightness** (**直**) becomes **yang** (**阳**) and **rigidity** (**刚**), yet this is also the same **qi** (**气**).\nThough it is said to transform from **twisted to straight** (**由枉而直**),\nin truth, it is **both twisted and straight** (**即枉即直**).\n\nAfter penetrating the **hidden depths** (**隐曲**) and uncovering the **root source** (**本源**),\nits **manifestation** (**见**) becomes easy,\nbut **guarding** it is difficult (**为守则难**).\nOnly by **refining it gently** (**优焉游焉**),\nnurturing its **initial traces** (**端倪**),\nand further **lowering oneself** (**卑以下人**),\nmaintaining **humility** (**谦**) in self-cultivation (**自待**),\ncan one avoid the **restless and violent** (**躁暴急迫**) nature,\nprevent **erroneous perceptions** (**邪见**), and\nnot stir **mundane fire** (**凡火**).\nOnly then can one forge the **golden elixir** (**金丹**).\n\nThus, one **controls the qi with the spirit** (**以神驭气**), and **unites the spirit with the qi** (**以气合神**),\nhidden yet manifest without trace (**隐显无端**), changing yet unmeasurable (**变化莫测**).\nThis is the *\"ultimate sincerity without pause\"* (**至诚无息**),\n*\"embodying things without omission\"* (**体物无遗**),\n*\"present in all yet not in any\"* (**无在而无不在**).\nHow can it be anything but **overflowing** (**盈**)?\n\nYet one must be **humble** (**谦**) to receive benefit,\nand **hollowed** (**洼**) to become **full** (**为盈**).\nOtherwise, how could one contain all **ultimate** (**万有**)?\n\nAs for this **slightest spark of bending** (**一曲之微**),\nit is all part of one’s **original nature** (**本来之物**).\nThis is what is meant by *\"worn\"* (**敝**),\nfor *\"worn\"* is also *\"old\"* (**敝即故**).\nAs the *Zhongyong* says: *\"To review the old and know the new\"* (**温故而知新**).\n\nIf the student wishes to obtain **news** (**新闻**) and generate **new intentions** (**新意**),\nthey must not neglect to **review the old** (**故有**) and **nurture it** (**温之**).\nOnly then can they attain the **new** (**新**).\nThis is also *\"worn yet renewed\"* (**敝即新**).\n\nThough *\"worn\"* is little (**敝亦无几**),\nif one nurtures it in its **fewness** (**少而养之**),\nthe **vast and harmonious qi** (**浩然之气**) can fill heaven and earth,\nand pierce the **Big Dipper** (**贯斗牛**).\n\nIf one claims the **Dao** is vast and all-encompassing (**浩潮弥纶**),\nthat it is **present in all yet not in any** (**无在不是**),\nand takes its **many** (**多**) aspects to practice,\nI fear **principle and desire** (**理欲**) will become **entangled** (**杂乘**),\nand **good and evil** (**善恶**) will be **indistinguishable** (**莫辨**).\nSometimes guarding the **middle** (**守中**), sometimes collecting **medicinal herbs** (**采药**),\nsometimes advancing **fire** (**进火**) and retreating **symbols** (**退符**),\nclinging to **forms** (**着象**) and grasping **names** (**执名**),\nthe more one does, the better (**多多益善**),\nyet it remains a **rootless practice** (**无本之学**),\nhaving not attained **cessation and return** (**止归**),\nand is ultimately a **tangle of confusion** (**一个迷团**).\nNo wonder one remains **lifelong in doubt, never enlightened** (**毕生怀疑莫悟**).\n\nThe **sage** (**圣人**) embraces **Oneness** (**抱一**) for self-cultivation (**自修**),\nand also applies it to the world (**施之天下**),\nas a **model for all** (**天下楷模**).\nIf one does not know that the **method of bending** (**一曲之道**) is truly the **unifying method** (**一贯之道**),\nand occasionally strays from it—\n**occasional straying** (**偶离**) means **no model** (**无式**),\n**no model** means **no attainment** (**无成**),\nand the **Dao** is thus **unreliable** (**何赖焉**).\n\nFor the **Dao** is fundamentally **one principle of heaven and humanity** (**天人一理**),\n**all things share the same source** (**物我同源**),\nand is **common to all** (**公共之物**).\nYet today’s students each **cling stubbornly to their own views** (**固执己见**),\nclaiming none can surpass them (**谓人莫己若**).\nEven this **boastful thought** (**矜骄之念**) has already obscured their **innate clarity** (**灵明**),\nand they do not understand to **measure the ancient and apply it to the present** (**酌古准今**),\nnor to **take the law from its highest source** (**取法乎上**).\n\nThe *Zhongyong* says:\n*\"The **Dao of the gentleman** is **darkly luminous** (**暗然**) and naturally stands forth\"* (**自章**),\n*\"The **Dao of the petty person** is **brightly evident** (**的然**) and naturally perishes\"* (**自亡**).",

      "translated_text": "「The **Dao** of the true cultivator is indeed something to be held with solemn reverence. Even if one approaches the brink of divine transformation, it is merely what one ought to achieve by duty and nature—why must one display it to the world and boast of one’s accomplishments? If one praises oneself, not only will others despise it, but the merit itself will be false and not genuine. The ancients, after achieving their goals, withdrew humbly, never claiming credit for their deeds; it is fitting that their merit should cover the world and serve as a model for all ages.\n\nAs for self-cultivation and self-discipline, it is like clothing that brings warmth or food that satisfies hunger—each person attains their own comfort and joy, and what others possess is sufficient for them. Why should one be arrogant and self-conceited, boasting of one’s strengths? Though it is said that wisdom grows daily and insight expands each day, this is merely a common trait of human nature—only that I have attained it earlier. Where is the true merit in that?\n\nIf one boasts of their strengths, then those strengths will become weaknesses. Even the most foolish person would not willingly fall behind—how many disputes do not originate from this? The gentleman has no need to contend, so the world cannot contend with his ability. The ancient saying, *\"Bend and you will remain whole\"* (**曲则全**), is indeed not empty words—does it not mean that one must fully receive and fully return to attain the **Dao**? This is the **Zhongyong**’s **Dao**, and the next level is the **Dao** of bending (**致曲**), which is hidden yet profound (**隐曲**).\n\nThe **Dao** is called *\"**Xuanqiao**\"* (**玄窍**), the Buddha calls it *\"**Nagaraja**\"* (**那个**), and the Confucian calls it *\"**duanni**\"* (**端倪**). Though it is not void nor empty, it is the origin from which heaven and earth opened, and all beings emerged. At every moment, its movement and stillness are visible.\n\nWhen it is still and gives rise, it does not come from external stimulation—\nsuddenly one becomes aware, and this awareness itself is bending (**曲**).\nWhen it moves and manifests, it arises from spontaneous resonance—\nsuddenly it stirs, and this stirring itself is bending (**曲**).\nEssentially, all comes from a time of ignorance and unawareness,\nwhen the **qi**’s momentum moves on its own.\nIt moves and suddenly one is aware—this is true movement, true awareness.\nBut its momentum is extremely subtle, fleeting in an instant;\na mere shift of thought or breath is already **postnatal** (**后天**),\nand cannot serve as the root of life for beings,\nnor as the foundation for refining the elixir (**炼丹**).\n\nWe receive **qi** and take form as beings and things—\nall from this single moment of differentiation.\nThe right and wrong, true and false of **Dao** cultivation—\nwhich does not originate from this single moment?\n*The Zhou Shu* says:\n*\"**Wàngniàn** (**罔念**) leads to madness, **kèniàn** (**克念**) leads to sainthood.\"*\nThe difference between sainthood and madness is decided by this single moment—\nso swift, this is what is meant by bending (**一曲**).\n\nThe ancients likened it to lightning and the flash of a stone,\nor to riding a thousand-li horse that leaves the dust behind and gallops on.\nAt this moment, one must have the **Buddha’s wisdom eye** (**智珠**) brightly illuminating\nto recognize it clearly.\nOnce this **origin** (**端倪**) is known,\none must still nourish and expand it—\nas Mencius said: *\"Fire begins with a spark, water with a trickle,\nyet they grow vast and fill the heavens and earth.\"*\n\nBut how does one expand?\nIt is not by forcing oneself to submit—\nonly then can **true qi** (**正气**) stretch naturally.\nIt is not by lowering oneself artificially—\nonly then can **heavenly virtue** (**天德**) remain whole.\nOne must only guard the **Dao**’s original state within things,\nunmixed and undivided,\nwarm in its stillness,\nembracing **oneness** (**一**),\nnot seeking novelty in new ends,\nnor indulging in the complexity of names and forms (**名象**).\nThus, one will not fall deeper into confusion with each passing day,\nbut instead find joy in the **Dao**’s ceaseless renewal (**日新又新**).\n\nThe ancient sages knew that bending (**一曲**) is the stage for attaining immortality and sainthood,\nso they embraced **qi** with the **Dao**,\nlet the **Dao** depend on **qi**,\nand united **Dao** and **qi** without separation,\nas the essential method for self-cultivation,\nand as the model for all under heaven.\nIf one insists on their own views,\nthen they obscure their own clarity and fail to shine.\nWhat’s more, self-praise leads to labor without merit,\nand self-conceit leads to shortcoming rather than growth.\n\nWisdom arises from emotion (**智起情生**),\noften becoming the **Dao**’s greatest harm.\nOnly by not insisting on one’s own views,\nnot praising oneself nor boasting of one’s strengths,\ncan one’s mind remain tranquil and **qi** harmonious—\nthen naturally, there will be no evil outside,\nno exhaustion within,\nand who will contend with them?\n\nThe **Dao**’s subtle and silent transformation is thus:\nunless one embraces **oneness** (**抱一**) and fully receives and returns,\nhow can one return to the **Taishang**’s (**太始**) original beginning?\n\n**Chapter 23: Rare Speech and Naturalness**\nRare speech and naturalness (**希言自然**).\nHence, gusts of wind do not last all morning,\nsudden rains do not persist all day.\nWho is responsible for this?\nHeaven and earth.\nEven heaven and earth cannot endure long—\nhow much less so humanity?\nThus, those who practice the **Dao**:\nthose aligned with the **Dao** are in harmony with the **Dao**,\nthose aligned with **virtue** (**德**) are in harmony with **virtue**,\nthose aligned with loss are in harmony with loss.\nThose in harmony with the **Dao** find the **Dao** rejoices in their attainment;\nthose in harmony with **virtue** find **virtue** rejoices in their attainment;\nthose in harmony with loss find loss rejoices in their attainment—\ntruly, there is no doubt,\nthere is no disbelief.\n\nThe **Dao** is fundamentally without sound or breath (**无声无息**),\nso it is called *\"**rare speech**\"* (**希言**).\nThe **Dao** is fundamentally without action or contrivance (**无为无作**),\nso it is called *\"**naturalness**\"* (**自然**).\n\nWhat can endure, what can last—\nit is nothing but following heaven’s movement and acting in accordance with one’s nature,\nlistening solely to the **qi**’s momentum as it unfolds.\nIf one forces or fabricates, unable to follow the **qi**’s momentum,\nand fails to align with the **Heaven-Earth**’s (**乾坤**) revolving cycles,\nthe rising and setting of the sun and moon,\nthen it will be like fleeting winds of boiling soup,\nviolent torrents of rain—\nuprooting great trees, surging across flat plains,\ncoming swiftly, departing swiftly—\nhow could their force endure all day or all morning?\n\nYet who is responsible for this?\nAsk heaven and earth, and they will not know.\nFor heaven and earth are the sovereign rulers of all things—\nif they do not follow their own constant ways,\nthey still cannot endure long.\nHow much less so humanity, which exists within heaven and earth,\nlike a single grain in the **Taicang** (**太仓**)?\nIf one does not practice the **Dao**’s enduring way,\nhow can they hope to last?\n\nThus, the **Taishang** (**太上**) teaches that the **Dao**’s source\nis **wuwei** (**无为**) as its essence,\nand naturalness (**自然**) as its function.\nIf one does not attend to this,\nbut instead boasts of shortcuts,\nor seeks out marvelous tricks,\none is mistaken!\n\nObserve those who study the **Dao**—\nthough they may dwell in distant east, west, south, or north,\nand their teachings vary in sound,\nyet if they have a resolve for the **Dao**,\nand do not stray into false paths,\nthey will all converge in perfect accord without division.»",

not be misled by false paths and heterodox teachings.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Perils of Self-Imposed Extremes**\nHe who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm,\nhe who strides cannot walk steadily.\nHe who insists on his own view sees nothing clearly,\nhe who clings to his own righteousness cannot shine forth.\nHe who boasts of his own merits gains no true success,\nhe who vaunts his own virtues cannot endure.\n\nIn the **Dao**, such actions are called\nsuperfluous food and burdensome exertion.\nMen may detest them, hence the **Dao**-bearer does not indulge.\n\nEarlier, it was said that the **Dao** is spoken of rarely and naturally,\nnot like the world’s coarse and dull masses,\nwho mistake idleness for *wuwei* and reckless abandon for naturalness.\n\nTruly, this is the **Dao** of Great Balance and Rectitude,\nconforming to Heaven’s principle and human nature,\nfollowing the sage’s path and the kingly **Way**,\npreserving and reflecting upon the origin,\nreturning to the source—\nthus, in harmony with Heaven’s command,\nthere is *wuwei* yet nothing remains undone,\nnaturalness yet nothing unnatural.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"To exhaust principle and fulfill nature, reaching even to fate\"*—\nthis must be the man of **Dao**!\n\nExcess is fault, deficiency is also fault.\nThe *Shujing* states: *\"Without partiality or cliques, the kingly **Way** flows vast and unrestricted\"*—\nthis is indeed the case.\n\nEven as a man stands upright,\nthere is an original constancy that does not alter.\nThe *tiptoeing* (跂) is when both feet are raised in support.\nThe *Shijing* says: *\"On tiptoe, I await him\"*—\nwith this stance, one may gaze far and wide,\nbut if it is meant to endure, how can it last?\n\nThe *striding* (跨) is when both feet are spread apart.\nWith this, one may ride astride a horse and rest upon the saddle,\nbut if it is meant for walking, how can it proceed?\nThe enlightened do not cling to their own views—\nclinging to one’s own view, clarity is lost.\nThe illustrious do not insist on their own sight—\ninsisting on one’s own sight, brilliance is obscured.\n\nOften, those who boast of their own merits reap no true success,\nfor success that is genuine cannot be concealed by others—\nwhy boast at all?\nOften, those who vaunt their own virtues cannot last,\nfor virtues that endure command natural reverence—\nwhy need to vaunt?\n\nIf one does not believe in the **Dao** of *wuwei* and naturalness,\nand does not know how *\"without doing, yet all things are done\"* (莫之为而为),\n*\"without striving, yet all things

perspective,\nlike gluttony’s excess or labor’s overstrain—\nnot only is it unprofitable, but it harms.\n\nThe scholar must align with the *wuwei* of Heaven’s **virtue**,\nfollow the *ziran* (自然) of things’ inherent principle—\nnot only should one not impose human contrivances upon it,\nbut even things themselves should be allowed their ease.\n\nRegulate one’s diet and rest—\nif even slightly mismatched, exceeding the natural measure,\nwhether through overindulgence or excessive asceticism—\nlike a dog’s overstuffed belly bringing injury,\nor a cow’s overworked body bringing exhaustion—\nthis is to invite inner unrest and self-detestation.\n\nHence it is said: *\"Men may detest them.\"*\n\nThose who twist and strain, seeking to stand or walk,\nto shine or be illustrious,\nto achieve merits that move others,\nor virtues that surpass the crowd—\nsuch endeavors are indeed difficult!\n\nThe **Dao**-bearing gentleman despises them utterly,\ndeeming them unworthy of his own company.\n\nThis rare mention of naturalness\nis but one principle: **cleanness** (清净).\n\nWhat is **cleanness** (清)?\nWhen not a single thought arises.\n\nWhat is **purity** (净)?\nWhen not a speck of dust defiles the mind.\n\nThe goal is for this heart\nto be like a mirror without dust,\nor still water without ripples—\na single luminous, empty spirit,\nand **cleanness** is attained.\n\nIf the world’s common folk,\ndull and muddled, spend the day doing nothing,\nthis is not **cleanness**.\n\nOnly when **cleanness** holds light,\nand **purity** reflects brilliance,\nlike a moonlit pool’s unobstructed radiance—\nthen does one truly grasp **cleanness**.\n\nYet if even a trace of self-display or self-righteousness remains,\nit becomes an obstruction.\n\nThus, the seeker of the **Dao** must cultivate a boundless heart,\nletting no thing or thought disturb his mind or occupy his spirit.\nThrough prolonged nurturing, a single luminous spark\nilluminates all—\nlike the sun and moon in the sky,\npenetrating every corner.\n\nOnly fear arises when\none thought of clarity is followed by another of indulgence—\nthen clarity is no longer constant.\n\nMencius’ strength lay in *yangqi* (养气),\nfor when *qi* is undisturbed, the spirit is naturally luminous,\nand when the spirit is luminous, the heart is naturally at ease—\nthus he spoke not of nurturing the heart but of nurturing the *qi*,\ntruly knowing that when the will is unified, it moves the *qi*,\nand when the *qi* is unified, it moves the will.\n\nIf one merely claims to nurture the heart\nwithout seeking to nurture the *qi*,\nmany will never find peace in their hearts their whole lives.\n\nWhen the heart is truly **cleanness** (清净),\nthe true *yang* (真阳) naturally arises.\nAll ascensions and descents, movements and transformations,\nmust follow their natural course.\n\nTo force the *tiptoeing* (跂) to stand,\nor the *striding* (跨) to walk—\nexcessive food or

This is **qi** (氣) that is hollow and dissipated, losing its essence; this is the **spirit** (神) that is restless and ungrounded, losing its clarity. Even if the body remains, its vitality is scarce indeed—how much more so for the **great elixir Dao** (金丹大道)?\n\nThis exposition has now meticulously clarified the principles of **foundation-building** (築基), **self-refinement** (煉己), **forming the elixir** (結丹), **returning the elixir** (還丹), **jade nectar** (玉液), and the **small and great circulation** (小大周天). Those of noble birth and scholarly standing should cherish and never forget it, lest they fail to grasp its truth and practice it to its fullest.\n\nThus, upon attaining completion and realizing the Dao, one becomes a **celestial immortal** (神仙) forever, free from the sufferings of the mortal world. Is this not most fortunate? Each should strive accordingly!\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seventh: Always Doing Good to Save Others**\nTo act in goodness without leaving a trace,\nto speak in goodness without flaw,\nto advise without need of calculation,\nto close without latch or key yet unopenable,\nto bind without cords yet unbreakable—\nthis is why the **Sage** (聖人) always does good to save others,\nand thus never abandons anyone;\nalways does good to transform things,\nand thus nothing is cast aside.\n\nThis is called **inheriting clarity** (袭明).\nThus, the good person becomes the teacher of the ungood,\nand the ungood person becomes the **resource** (資) of the good.\nIf one does not honor their teacher,\nnor cherish their resource,\nthough wise, they remain in great confusion.\nThis is called **the essence of subtlety** (要妙).\n\nThe **Sage’s** heart seeks only within themselves,\nnot from others.\nIn their application to affairs and things,\n**non-action** (無為) yet nothing is unaccomplished,\nand wherever they act, it is fitting—\nwithin, they lack no self-fulfillment,\nwithout, they cause no harm to others.\n\nAs the *I Ching* says:\n*\"When the time is to stop, they stop;\nwhen the time is to act, they act—\nneither movement nor stillness loses its proper moment,\ntheir Dao is radiant and clear.\"*\nCould this not be the **Sage**?\n\nWhen it comes to action,\nthey act when the time is right—\nthat is all.\nThey see neither the source of their coming,\nnor the destination of their going—\nhow could there be any trace?\n\nTheir goodness in action is such.\n\nWhen it comes to speech,\nthey speak when the time is right—\nthat is all.\nWithin, they suffer no humiliation,\nwithout, they bring no shame to others—\nhow could there be any flaw to be criticized?\n\nTheir goodness in speech is such.\n\nAs for matters requiring calculation,\nor affairs needing deliberation,\nthey measure by **reason** (理),\nand weigh by **humanity** (情).\nThey act in accordance with reason,\nand cease when fitting with humanity—\nwhen more is needed, they give more;\nwhen less is needed, they give less.\nWhy bother with the labor of calculation?\nThis is **spontaneous response without contrivance** (因應無心),\nwhere both self and others transform naturally—\nwhat else could be called **good judgment** (善計)?\n\nThere are also matters that should be closed or bound.\nFor others, failure to close leads to chaos,\nfailure to bind leads to dispersal—\nyet the **Sage** cuts off all external ties,\nand no internal thought arises.\nComplete and whole,\nis this not what is meant by **good closure** (善閉)?\n\nThough there are no cords to bind,\nno keys to secure,\nthere is no gap to exploit—\nit is as if sealed tightly,\nand thus cannot be opened or undone.\nIs this not **the natural perfection of the Dao** (天理浑全),\nunassailable?\n\nAs for these principles,\nthey follow **the natural order of Heaven** (自然之天),\nuntainted by human contrivance.\nThus their effects are such.\n\nIn essence, they **cultivate inwardly** (內修) **while emulating outwardly** (外慕),\n**self-correcting** (自正) **without seeking anything else**.\nThis is how they **establish themselves and others** (立己立人),\nleaving no one abandoned;\n**perfect themselves and transform things** (成己成物),\ndiscarding no talent.\n\nHow great is their virtue in saving and benefiting others!\nThis is **not merely inheriting clarity** (重袭其明),\nbut also **extending it to govern and transform** (理民及物).\n\nYet the good person does not know themselves as good at first—\nthey forget the distinction between self and others,\nso the ungood revere them as teachers.\nThe good person is also not self-satisfied—\nwhen they see the ungood,\nthe good person takes them as **resources** (資).\nThey follow what is good,\nand correct what is ungood—\nthus, through this, the good person advances further in goodness,\nuntil they reach the realm of **great transformation and divine perfection** (美大化神).\n\nIf common people rely on their own talents,\nboast of their own abilities,\nand ignore the good as if it were nonexistent—\nnot learning from them as models,\nnor abandoning the ungood as worthless—\ninstead, they despise them and deem them unworthy,\nnot understanding that *\"seeing the worthy, one should emulate them;\nseeing the unworthy, one should reflect inwardly\"* (見賢思齊，不賢內省).\nThough good and evil differ,\nthey are both **teachers and resources for self-improvement** (師資).\nSuch people, who do not honor their teachers\nnor cherish their resources,\nare truly the **foolish and self-deluded** (愚而好自用，賤而好自專),\nnot the **enlightened** (昏昧人).\n\nGoodness is what one learns from,\nevil is what one takes warning from.\nWherever one encounters it,\nit benefits themselves—\nno one is without benefit to their body.\nThis is truly the **essential method for self-cultivation** (修己之要術),\nthe **wondrous Dao for governing the body** (治身之妙道).\nLet all strive accordingly!\n\nThis exposition reveals the **Sage’s** words,\nwhich encompass all things.\n\nThe principles of affairs and things\nare none other than the **Dao of life and essence** (性命之道).\n**Substance and function** (體用) are inherently unified,\n**root and branch** (本末) never separate.\n\nFor instance, *\"good action leaves no trace\"* (善行無辙迹),\nextended to the **flow of qi** (氣機流行),\nthe **self-moving celestial chariot** (河車自運),\nis also such.\n\n*\"Good speech leaves no flaw\"* (善言無瑕摘),\nmeaning there is no **method to be spoken of** (法可說),\nthis is called **spontaneous expression** (說法).\nIt is also said to be the **intention of the ancestors** (祖師西來意).\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Heaven speaks not, yet the four seasons move in their course,\nand all things are brought to birth.\"*\nIf there are flaws to be criticized,\nthen there must be speech to be seen—\nthis is not the **Sage’s** true understanding of **heart and spirit** (心領神會).\n\nThe **Buddhist school** (釋氏) says:\n*\"The Dao is originally without words,\nyet people have spoiled it by speaking of it.\"*\nThis is their meaning.\n\n*\"Good judgment requires no calculation\"* (善計無筹策),\nfor the **circulation’s** (周天) numbers\nare merely a metaphor for the three hundred transformations—\nin truth, there are no **divination lines** (爻策) to calculate.\nIf there were, it would not be the **natural fire at its proper stage** (火候).\n\n*\"Good closure has no latch or key\"* (善閉無關鍵),\nmeaning it is the **primordial chaos unbroken** (鸿蒙未破),\nthe **original spirit** (元神) silent and still,\nthe **original qi** (元氣) in profound obscurity,\nreturning to the **beginning of the Primordial** (元始之初),\nto form the embryo and become the **Sage** (聖).」",

**inner virtue**—\nthis alone serves as the foundation for reception.\n\nThe common saying goes:\n*\"Not fearing one instance,\nonly fearing accumulation.\nNot fearing suddenness,\nonly fearing contrivance.\"*\nTruly, these words are wise.\n\nThe student who seeks to know the **Dao of intent** must not merely rely on spontaneity.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Eliminate Excess and Extremity**\n\n*\"If one seeks to take the world by force,\nI see it as inevitable failure.\nThe world is a divine instrument—\nit cannot be seized, cannot be grasped.\nTo act upon it brings ruin;\nto cling to it brings loss.\"*\n\nThus, things either move or follow,\nare drawn in or exhaled,\nare strong or weak.\nTherefore, the Sage eliminates excess,\neliminates extravagance,\neliminates excessiveness.\n\nThe **Dao** is originally without sound or scent,\npure and natural in its clarity.\nThe practitioner must also remain unknowing and unrecognizing,\npurely yielding to nature—\nthis is the heart-seal of ancestors from antiquity to the present,\nunalterable and beyond deviation.\n\nYet, the world’s heterodox sects mock our **Way** as solitary cultivation and silent refinement,\nultimately calling it stubborn emptiness and uselessness.\nHow could I not reflect upon this?\n\n*\"If one seeks to govern the world with active measures,\nI see that the more one acts, the more inevitable failure becomes.\nThe world, though vast, is originally governed by the divine instrument.\nWhat is called the **Primordial Dao** is the silent, natural one.\nThe world is the framework of the divine instrument;\nthe divine instrument is the sovereign of the world.\nThe world may be acted upon, but the divine instrument cannot be seized.\nIf one acts upon it, at first there is confusion and excess,\nuntil restraints are abandoned and boundaries transgressed,\nand **Heaven’s virtue** is utterly exhausted—\nthis is precisely why action leads to ruin.\nHow much better to succeed through **non-action** than to fail through action!\nHow much better to attain the **Dao** through non-attachment than to lose through attachment!\"*\n\nSince the **Dao** originates from **Heaven**,\nand **Heaven’s Way** is **non-action**,\nyet spontaneous transformation arises within it—\nhow could it be otherwise?\n\nObserve the moment of birth:\nThe **Primordial Yang** initiates with **Heaven’s Element**—\nsometimes **yang** moves forward first;\n**Earth’s Element** sustains life—\nsometimes **yin** follows afterward.\nMotion and stillness interdependently root each other,\neach with its necessity.\n\nAs for **qi**—\nwhen extended, it bends inward, and inhalation arises naturally;\nwhen contracted, it expands, and exhalation flows effortlessly.\nThus, **vital breath** flourishes,\nand **generative vitality** endures forever.\n\nYet, due to differing endowments,\nsome are strong with abundant **qi** and robust **essence**,\nothers weak with scarce **qi** and feeble **essence**—\nall these are disparities of **post-heaven** cultivation.\nSince things are inherently distinct,\nsometimes **qi** ascends vigorously,\nsometimes it descends gently—\nall these are the natural operations of **Heaven’s Way**,\nbeyond human contrivance.\n\nEven at the outset, there may be traces of effort,\nyet one must follow the momentum and align with the moment—\nacting when appropriate, resting when due,\nblending effort with spontaneity,\nso that over time it remains unspent.\n\nThis is why the Sage, when gathering medicinal herbs or refining elixirs,\nmust eliminate what is already excessive,\neliminate what is overly extravagant,\neliminate what is overly extreme—\nalways returning to moderation,\nconstantly embodying harmony.\nThough it may seem like **action**,\nit is equal to **non-action**;\nthough it may seem like **doing**,\nit is the same as **non-doing**.\n\nThus, **being** and **non-being** generate each other—\nonly then can one speak of the **Great Dao**.\nThis is the saying: *\"The **Great Dao** is **non-action**\"*—\n**non-action** being the study of **nurturing innate nature**;\nyet it also involves **action**—\n**action** being the craft of **cultivating post-heaven life**.\nOne must know that **action** and **non-action**,\nthough differing in their names for cultivating **nature and life**,\nshare the same sovereign principle—\nnever to be moved arbitrarily,\nfor movement is deviation from the **Middle**.\n\nWhether **action** or **non-action** is improper,\nthe key is to maintain the **Middle** without confusion,\nto know the times and circumstances,\nto advance when opportunity arises,\nto retreat when difficulty comes—\nthen **non-action** is achieved,\nand **action** is also attained.\n\nWhat is this **sovereign principle**?\nIt is the **divine instrument of the world**.\nIf one knows the original source,\nreturning to **undifferentiated unity**,\n**void yet luminous, unobscured**—\ninitially, **action** is necessary;\nultimately, **non-action** is necessary.\nOtherwise, if one insists on **non-action** and spontaneity alone,\nwhy did Confucius speak of the **Dao**,\nwhy did he speak of **striving to practice**,\nwhy did he speak of **choosing the good and holding fast**?\n\nKnow that the **Way of self-cultivation** lies in **nature and life**;\nthe **work of nature and life** requires balancing ease and effort,\nnot rigidly distinguishing them—\nall depends on the **divine clarity of virtue**.\n\nAs in governing a

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: *\"He who aids the sovereign with the Dao does not rely on arms to subdue the world.\"* Even if one attains perfect refinement, yet after the fire-alchemical tempering, when all coarse *qi* has been purged and true *qi* has yet to accumulate, one’s state will be indeterminate—neither fully present nor fully absent, subtle and hard to discern. Moreover, there are those who, without refining, see their *qi* scatter, and those whose *qi* scatters the more they refine—all due to the mind’s fluctuations, like creeping vines that resist eradication. Hence it is said: *\"Where the teacher treads, brambles spring up.\"* How much more so when the divine fire is kindled, and the yin-*qi* cannot be retained, while long-standing ailments and childhood infirmities are all driven forth—some exiting through sweat and filth, others manifesting as sores and toxins, in varied forms.\n\nThe cultivator must not be alarmed by these as illness; only a tranquil mind can transmute *qi*. It is clear that the Way of self-refinement must transform the common body into a jade-like one, the turbid form into a golden one. Never be startled—for alarm stirs the posterior-heaven’s vulgar fire, gravely injuring the primal *qi*.\n\nThus it is said: *\"After a great campaign, there will surely be years of hardship.\"* The skilled warrior values decisiveness; the adept alchemist values divine swiftness. Hence it is said: *\"Decisive, and nothing more.\"* When the cultivator reaches this stage of pure yang transformation, he must not rely on his strength—assuming he can go without hunger or thirst, move like the wind, dispense with stove in winter or fan in summer, and wield extraordinary powers far beyond the common man, boasting of his might. Such self-conceit stirs the posterior-heaven’s vulgar fire anew; even if he avoids external censure, his inner elixir will surely falter. What need to speak of those who, after ten months of gestation and three years of nursing, complete every task with clockwork precision, then vaunt their achievements, arrogantly lording over others? Such behavior is far from the vessel of the Dao.\n\nEven if one succeeds in deeds, one must also succeed in repaying debts. The peril of collapse is beyond reckoning!\n\nWorse still, if one relies on his strength while failing to cultivate humility and sincerity, even if he practices virtue and concentrates on the Dao, he will be like a rigid tree—strong yet lifeless—unable to rival the supple, fragile yet vital plant. Day by day, year by year, as time passes, his vital essence will only wane. How could he then long enjoy the pleasures of mortal life?\n\nThus it is said: *\"When things are at their peak, decay follows.\"* From this, it is clear that those who exalt themselves only bring themselves low, and those who boast only court danger. How un-Dao!\n\nBetter to abandon rigid strength, to be plain and unassuming, to accept fate with equanimity, letting heaven arrange all things—thus achieving strength without striving, the Dao without effort. Here lies the peril of the initial fire-alchemical practice; let the scholar beware.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Tranquility and Simplicity as Supreme**\n\nWarfare is an ominous instrument; men detest it, and thus those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it. The gentleman, in peace, values the left; in war, the right. Warfare is no instrument of the gentleman—it is used only when unavoidable, and even then, tranquility is paramount. To rejoice in victory is to delight in killing, and he who delights in killing cannot prevail in the world.\n\nThus, auspicious rites favor the left, while inauspicious ones favor the right. Hence, the left is reserved for the vice-general, the right for the supreme commander, both treated with funeral rites. Many lives lost demand lamentation; victory, too, is met with funeral rites. The sage governs the world with virtue and morality as supreme, law and teaching secondary. Only when absolutely necessary does he raise armies, prepare arms, and send his eldest sons to war, his younger to bear the dead. To do so is to invite calamity—*the Book of Changes* warns deeply against it.\n\nHow much worse for those who indulge in the ferocity of the tiger’s gaze, the eagle’s boldness, who flaunt arms on the battlefield and wield might in the barracks, who see conquest as gain and war as skill! Such warfare is not merely chaotic—it is the very epitome of disorder. For the finest weapon is not the one that kills, but the one that ceases killing. The ancients called halting the blade *wu* (martial virtue); these men call exhaustion of arms their prowess—yet such is no instrument for the ruler.\n\nWhat, then, is the ruler’s true instrument? The Dao. Virtue. The love of life and hatred of slaughter. To speak of arms is to invite killing.\n\nWhen the clamor of slaughter resounds, when rivers and mountains tremble, even chickens and dogs are unsettled—what horror is there beyond? How much more so for worms that cling to life, ants that fear death? Even the most insignificant creatures recoil from it—what then of men? Thus, those who follow the Dao avoid it entirely.\n\nAll things value yang over yin—the left, representing yang, is the breath of life; the right, representing yin, is the seed of slaughter. Therefore, the gentleman, in ordinary times, honors the left. Only in war does he abandon the left for the right, revealing how deeply he despises arms.\n\nEven if one must remove tyrants, punish the wicked, and rescue the people—raising righteous banners and forming disciplined ranks—warfare remains an ominous instrument, one even the sage avoids. In times of peace, a nation needs no martial preparations. When borders cry out in distress and rebellion flares, and only then must arms be raised, they must be wielded with precision, rewards and punishments meted out with rigor. Where the army marches, the people offer water and grain; where the soldiers pass, the fields remain undisturbed. This is the way of subduing both the yielding and the rigid—through awe and virtue—clearly demonstrated.\n\nLet there be no display of martial might, no boasting of strategic brilliance. Only tranquility and non-action, ease and naturalness.",

      "translated_text": "「Though dwelling in lands of tumultuous warfare, he maintains an orderly and tranquil demeanor among his troops.\n\nWith this, how could any city not be taken? With this, how could any enemy not be crushed? Victory is assured.\n\nYet still, such victories are but commonplace in the art of war—how can one claim glory like inscribed tripods, or record exploits in banners and armor? Would one thus set this as a model for future generations?\n\nIf this were held as a model, it would inevitably mean enduring the suffering of countless commoners to gain personal fame and fortune. Without the virtue of a life-giving being, yet harboring the intent to kill, how can this be justified?\n\nHe who delights in killing, his heart is cruel, his methods harsh and unyielding. Unable to embrace broad tolerance, he is ever petty and self-righteous.\n\nSuch a person cannot aspire to dominion over the world. If he were to achieve dominion, the masses would have no survivors.\n\nIn ancient times, auspicious rites were held on the left, and inauspicious on the right. A subordinate general, being second in rank, should reside on the left, yet he is placed on the right; a supreme general, being highest in rank, should reside on the right, yet he is placed on the left.\n\nThis is but the knowledge that he who holds absolute authority over slaughter and conquest is the supreme general. Subordinate generals must obey his commands and may not flaunt their own martial might—this is akin to treating funeral rites as military rites.\n\nHow much more fitting is it to engage in a solemn exchange of state letters, and to command soldiers to sing dirges for the deceased?\n\nThis is the utmost of caution and restraint.\n\nAnd what of the saying, *“He who kills many should weep with sorrow”*? It reveals that warfare is a grievous matter, one that wounds the natural compassion for all life, and arises only from dire necessity!\n\nThus, those who visit ancient battlefields see corpses filling the city walls and moats, blood pooling in the trenches and ravines, as if the heavens and earth themselves weep in sorrow, and the grasses and trees sigh in grief—what then of the people?\n\nEven if victorious in battle, with enemy chieftains subdued and the masses at peace, upon reflection, one sees that half the innocent children beneath the heavens are made to wander as refugees, and half perish. The heart is filled with sorrow!\n\nHow dare one return in triumph, boast of victories, and praise one’s own prowess?\n\nTo harbor such thoughts without a shred of virtue, yet display only remorse, is to treat oneself as one already in mourning.\n\nMencius said:\n*“I am skilled in forming ranks, I am skilled in waging war—this is a great crime!\nOnly when a sovereign loves virtue does the world stand without rival.”*\nAnd again:\n*“To awe the world is not done by the might of arms.”*\n\nThis clearly demonstrates that martial prowess without slaughter, and the virtuous without enemies, are the true models for an age of peace. Yet the use of arms is not the usual way of the sage, nor something the worthy ruler esteems.\n\nThis analogy is like using fire at the furnace—an act of necessity for the aged and infirm, to revive and mend what is broken, not to be done lightly. How can one claim singular merit or boast of extraordinary skill?\n\nThose who pursue the false paths of leftist Dao, such as kindling flames to retreat from calamity, gathering herbs to forge elixirs, or all manner of contrived actions, mistakenly believe these to be the way of the immortals. They are far astray!\n\nYet the vigor of youth requires no such labor—one may attain the elixir effortlessly. But the aged body, long steeped in physical decay and worldly desires, without the fierce refining and urgent tempering of Daoic practice, will find that its vital essence remains untransformed, and its desires unvanquished.\n\nWith a defiled and polluted body, how can one practice the Dao of non-action and naturalness?\n\nThis is like trying to welcome honored guests in a filthy dwelling—impossible!\n\nOne must first purify the impurities within oneself, and only then will form and matter dissolve, the root of attachment be eradicated, and the original true nature manifest freely within.\n\nAlthough one may forcefully cultivate, it must still be done with ease and naturalness, lest the post-heavenly fire of effort harm one’s innate vitality.\n\nThus, the highest ideal is to embrace tranquility and non-action, to achieve victory without glory.\n\nOtherwise, one has only post-heavenly cultivation without pre-heavenly foundation, mere common qi without true essence. A single breath of fiery passion—how long can it endure?\n\nHence it is said: *“Those who take pride in this are those who delight in killing.”*\nTo delight in killing is to nurture a heart brimming with slaughter—how can such a one be the master of the world and receive its blessings?\n\nIt is certain that he cannot aspire to dominion over the world.\n\nTherefore, those who cultivate the Dao, though they employ action as their practice, must also possess a heart of benevolence and compassion, one of humility and gentleness. Only then will the post-heavenly align with the pre-heavenly.\n\nThe ancients understood the fire’s tempering without reliance on divination, and the measure of medicines without weighing scales. They moved in harmony with the heavens and acted in accordance with their true nature.\n\nThough they engaged in action, they did no harm.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Knowing the Stopping Point Brings No Peril**\n\nThe Dao/Way is ever nameless.\nThough crude and simple, the world dares not submit to it.\nIf lords and kings could but guard it,\nAll things would willingly come as guests.\n\nHeaven and earth unite in embrace,\nAnd sweet dew descends—\nNo one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.\n\nWhen first the Dao/Way is cultivated with form,\nAnd form is given a name,\nOne must know when to stop—\nFor knowing the stopping point brings no peril.\n\nThe Dao/Way in the world is like streams and valleys to the great rivers and seas.\nThe Dao/Way itself is boundless and formless,\nYet truly all phenomena stand in orderly array,\nNo person lacks it, no thing is without it.\n\nBefore humans took form,\nThis essence was their foundation.\nAfter humans were born,\nThis essence became their root.\n\nThough it be most subtle and hidden,\nOne must never for a moment be parted from it—\nFor separation means all affairs and things collapse into ruin.\n\nHence it is said: *“The Dao/Way is ever nameless.”*\nYet for the sake of those who study it,\nOne must give it a name.\n\nA single grain of millet, the yang spirit three inches long,\nDwelling in the mysterious palace of self-sojourning,\nPermeating the dharma realm,\nIs like the pristine and complete *Taipu* (太朴).\n\nThough its form be small,\nIts function is vast.\n\nAll affairs and things in the world\nRely upon this as their sovereign—\nWho dares to submit to it afterward?\n\nEven as lords and kings wield the authority of life and death,\nAnd stand as masters of the myriad people,\nWho dares not obey their commands?",

      "translated_text": "From the very moment yin and yang unite,\nA single point descends into the Yellow Court—\nOne must then remain steadfast in its place, unmoving in its dwelling,\nOnly then does the Great Dao endure.\n\nOnce one knows where to halt,\nThe central sovereign abides unshaken—\nWhy then should one suffer birth and death,\nOr fall prey to danger and peril?\n\nFor the Dao, when dispersed abroad,\nIs boundless as the vast heavens,\nMysterious as the primordial chaos.\nYet when gathered within,\nIt is indistinct, formless—\nRetreating, yet profound in its concealment.\n\nIf scholars fail to grasp its fundamental principle,\nThey cannot find their true resting place.\nThen they scatter without order,\nUnable even to establish themselves—\nHow could they ever hope to transcend others?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the sea.\"*\n\nOnly by returning to its source\nDoes one achieve its fullness.\n\nAs Master Zisi taught:\n*\"The Way of the virtuous is subtle yet profound—*\n*This is the single root from which myriad branches arise,*\n*And all branches return to that single root.\"*\n\nIn this chapter, the sweet dew is born\nFrom the union of lead and mercury,\nAnd *\"knowing where to halt\"* is the gathering of divine qi in the Yellow Court.\n\nThe *Taishang* speaks of this in general terms;\nNow I shall elaborate the Dao for the seeker:\n\nThose who wish to cultivate life and nature\nMust first clarify lead and mercury.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Mercury is the original substance of my family,*\n*Lead is the immortal elixir of another house.\"*\n\nIf one speaks only of mind and nature,\nThere is no way to grasp it—\nThus the ancient immortals named it *mercury*.\n\nThis mercury is not external—\nIt is the soul’s essence, the vital fluid within:\nFrom tears, saliva, semen, blood, and the refined qi of the body,\nThe turbid residues of post-heaven transformation,\nIlluminated by divine fire for long ages,\nUntil it becomes the most refined essence.\n\nThis essence is the vessel of original nature—\nPure, untainted, equal to the boundless void.\nIf one relies solely on the post-heaven physical essence,\nAnd stirs it with martial or civil fire,\nWithout divine illumination,\nThe essence will not transform,\nAnd the soul’s nature will have no foundation.\n\nThus, those who refine the elixir\nMust first refine essence into qi—\nAs the saying goes:\n*\"This essence is not the common man’s—*\n*It is the Jade Emperor’s saliva from his mouth.\"*\n\nThe Jade Emperor is but a metaphor for the heart;\nThe heart’s essence is that saliva.\n\nOnce essence generates mercury,\nThe essence descends into the *kān* (坎) palace,\nWhile true yang ascends,\nTheir union in the Yellow Court’s inner cauldron—\nI gather divine qi here,\nAnd over time, true lead emerges,\nBurgeoning like silk threads—\nThis is what is called *\"obtaining the medicine.\"*\n\nYet this essence is true water,\nTrue yang is true qi,\nAnd true qi is lead.\nMercury is essence, lead is the common substance—\nBoth are post-heaven, tangible lead and mercury,\nUseful only for procreation,\nNot for the elixir of immortality.\n\nOnly when mercury descends\nAnd lead ascends,\nMeeting in the central palace,\nWith concentrated spirit and regulated breath,\nDoes the vapor rise—\nLike mist, like smoke,\nLike tides, like the sea—\nOnly then is it true lead,\nThe foundation for elixir refinement—\nThe union of *kān* and *lí* yielding the medicine.\n\nThen, stirring yang fire and yin talisman,\nAscending from the tailbone to the brain’s marrow.\nThe brain’s marrow, long storing yin essence,\nCombines with this true lead-qi,\nForming a unity—\nThis is *\"heaven and earth unite to form the elixir.\"*\n\nWhen yang ascends to the brain’s marrow,\nWhat does one perceive?\nA clarity of mind and senses,\nNo longer the usual daze—\nLike wind dispersing clouds,\nThe sky clears, the air is pure—\nA new and wondrous state—\nOnly then is it true mercury.\nThe earlier mercury was still common mercury,\nUnfit to nourish the immortal embryo.\n\nWhen lead and mercury merge in the brain’s marrow,\nThe coarse essence and qi of the body\nCombine and transform—\nNo longer lead, nor mercury,\nBut a cool, serene, and tranquil taste,\nSweet as dew, fragrant as nectar,\nNot the crude, turbid essence of before—\nThis is what the ancients called *\"monk’s milk poured upon the crown.\"*\n\nIt descends from the upper palate,\nSwallowed and nurtured in the Yellow Court—\nSealed and perfected.\n\nWhen this true essence is born,\nThe body softens like silk,\nNeither fully asleep nor awake;\nThe restless mind and body now still,\nUnshaken, at peace—\nFirm in its place, secure in its dwelling—\nWhat peril could there be?\n\nThis state requires supreme stillness and clarity.\nAs for the method of gathering,\nIt is achieved by single-minded concentration,\nWithout the slightest distraction—\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"The unforced gathering surpasses forced gathering.\"*\n\nThe practitioner advances step by step,\nEach step bearing its own verification.\nIf there is no genuine foundation,\nThe work remains incomplete.\nWhen the celestial mechanism is fully revealed,\nOne must personally verify it.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing Others and Knowing Oneself**\n\nTo know others is wisdom,\nTo know oneself is enlightenment.\nTo overcome others is strength,\nTo overcome oneself is power.\n\nContentment brings wealth,\nDiligence brings resolve.\nTo remain steadfast is endurance,\nTo die yet not perish is longevity.\n\nThe Way of self-cultivation\nIs none other than nature and fate.\n\nIf one wishes to fulfill nature and establish fate,\nOne must first preserve the heart and nurture nature,\nSafeguard life and complete the form.\nThrough cultivation, refinement, accumulation, and repetition,\nOriginal nature expands,\nAnd fate rests within oneself.\n\nYet to fulfill the heart,\nOne must first know nature—\nTo grasp the essence of life,\nPure as heaven’s principle,\nUnmixed with human desires—\nThis is true wisdom.\n\nFrom this, one restrains desires and preserves principle,\nEver-mindful, ever-vigilant,\nEnsuring private desires are utterly purged,\nWhile heaven’s principle flows freely—\nPiercing the original face,\nAwake and unobstructed,\nEver-clear and luminous—\nThis is the perfect enlightenment.\n\nThis is not mere imagination—\nIt is self-knowing, beyond others’ comprehension.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"To know others is wisdom,*\n*To know oneself is enlightenment.\"*",

the true spirit ascends,\nIt is like the death of an ordinary man.\nFor the death of an ordinary man means the scattering of the spirit;\nBut the death of the Sage means the spirit remains whole—\nThough the form dies, the spirit lives on.\nHow could it not share in the longevity of Heaven and Earth?\n\nThis speaks of knowing the human path,\nConquering human desires—\nStill, it is but the pursuit of principle and the fulfillment of nature.\n\nOnly when nature is seen and the mind is illuminated,\nPiercing through to the original source,\nWith spirit strong and qi robust,\nAnd all

*\"small beyond breaking.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"To always lack desire is to be called 'small.'\"*\n\nWhen viewed as great, it spreads across Heaven and Earth,\nNurturing all life;\nSpanning

greatness is truly equal to Heaven’s.\nYet the Sage never considers themselves great—\nOnly by not considering themselves great\nCan they achieve true greatness.\nThis is why they are called the Great

      "translated_text": "With gentle warmth, I refine the spirit-fire,\nSlowly simmering the elixir,\nAs a faint zephyr softly breathes,\nGently fanning the flames—\nNaturally, the essence melts and the qi transforms.\nThis is the refining of essence into qi.\n\nHow do we know it is the refining of essence into qi?\nBefore this, the external qi was not gathered,\nAnd my inner spirit, unpaired,\nExisted separately—\nThe *kan* and *li* energies remained distinct,\nUnconnected, their breaths uncoordinated.\nWhen the external qi is drawn inward\nTo govern the inner yin-essence,\nThe essence transforms at the qi’s arrival.\nThe upper *xīn* and lower *shèn* energies merge as one,\nAnd the *gōnggōng* chamber rests in ease,\nThe *shènfǔ* in freedom.\nThe external breath and the inner true breath\nMerge into a single qi,\nLike husband and wife in union—\nGathered yet never dispersing.\nDay fills, month swells,\nAnd the true yang now manifests in form.\nThis is the clear sign of qi transformation.\n\nOnce the qi is refined,\nThe work ascends further.\nWhat is meant by ascending?\nAt this stage, breath and spirit merge,\nQi and essence intertwine,\nCongealing in the *dāntián*,\nTwisting and flowing like a living dragon swimming—\nEndless transformations in a single day.\nI only concentrate the spirit within,\nDirect the breath without,\nAnd let it unfold naturally—\nNaturally, stillness gives way to motion,\nMotion returns to stillness.\nThis is the refining of qi into spirit.\n\nWhen stillness endures long,\nMy qi grows harmonized,\nAnd what once swirled in the *dāntián*\nIs now fully refined—\nSeemingly present, yet absent,\nMoving yet still.\nThe essence is imperceptible,\nBut upon close examination, it is known.\nAt this moment, all knowing and awareness must be extinguished,\nAll thoughts erased, all emptiness dissolved—\nEven the converging spirit-qi of the *dāntián*\nIs left to stir and adjust itself,\nTo warm and temper on its own.\nI only maintain emptiness and quietude,\nPurely yielding to nature—\nThe spirit enters the qi unknowingly,\nThe qi envelops the spirit unperceived.\nAfter such a cycle of refining,\nA fragrant breeze naturally arises,\nRising through the hundred channels,\nPerfuming the entire body.\nThis is called *shēngshén*—spirit generating qi.\n\nAgain, the spirit grows ever refined,\nWisdom ever expanding.\nWithin the single mind,\nOnly a breath arises from the *guī* channel—\nPure, subtle, and luminous as jade.\nThis is called *qìshēngshén*—qi generating spirit.\n\nThus, spirit and qi nourish each other,\nMutually engendering.\nNow is the time to let go completely—\nNeither clinging nor detaching,\nAs if with intent, yet without purpose.\nThis is the true practice of refining spirit back to emptiness.\n\nThese three stages of practice—\nRefining essence, qi, and spirit—\nCan be achieved simultaneously.\nThe practitioner must follow the Dao,\nNot stopping at mere crude merging of spirit and qi,\nBefore attaining great stillness,\nNor abandoning the seat when spirit and qi blend into indistinction,\nBefore reaching the realm of effortless, pure, and natural ease.\nOne must persist in this path,\nFrom refining essence onward,\nUntil qi grows long and spirit thrives,\nTransforming into pure, natural clarity.\nThen, applying the *guīlú* method,\nOnly then does one align with Heaven and Earth’s filling and emptying,\nWith the seasons’ spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\nThus, the practice is complete in a full cycle.\n\nWhen practiced thus,\nMy qi grows ever harmonized,\nMy spirit ever still,\nWithin me, infinite transformations,\nEndless vitality.\nDay and night, the work continues—\nUninterrupted, meticulous—\nYin and yang in perfect balance,\nTrue qi naturally perfuming,\nAscending to the *níwán*,\nDescending to the *dānfǔ*,\nPenetrating the hundred channels,\nPiercing the flesh—\nA surging force that cannot be restrained.\nThis is the path of the *Héchē*—\nNaturally open, requiring only slight guidance.\nNot like the false paths of others,\nWhere one forces their own empty intentions,\nDeadly and rigid in their movements,\nIgnoring the natural rise and fall of stillness and motion.\n\nWith time, the elixir forms, the Dao is realized—\nWalking through mist, flying through air,\nConsorting with Heaven.\nThe Sage achieves greatness—\nTruly not a light matter.\n\n---\n**Chapter 35: Going Without Harm**\n\nHold the Great Symbol,\nAnd all under Heaven will come.\nGo without harm,\nAnd peace and ease prevail.\nMusic and bait may halt the passing traveler,\nBut the Dao, once spoken,\nIs bland, without taste.\nIt cannot be seen,\nCannot be heard,\nCannot be exhausted in use.\nWhat is this Great Symbol?\nIt is the Dao that generates Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things.\nBecause it encompasses all,\nIt is called the Great Symbol.\nWhat symbol is this?\nIt is the boundless, the limitless.\nYet without a symbol, what can be held?\nAnd without holding, what is there to grasp?\nThis does not contradict the Dao.\n\nIf one can always hold it, always preserve it,\nWithout forgetting or forcing,\nThen the Great Symbol is held,\nAnd the Great Dao is present.\n\nConfucius once told Yan Yuan:\n*\"One day of self-discipline and returning to ritual,\nAnd all under Heaven will return to virtue.\"*\nThus, the Dao’s fulfillment\nIs the fulfillment of all under Heaven.\nWhether returning to the Dao or to virtue,\nAll is done with sincere and willing hearts—\nWhat harm could there be?\n\nI know that one qi flows continuously,\nAnd all things transform in silence.\nFlooding and draining,\nAbove and below in perfect harmony\nWithin the vast movement of Heaven.\nThis is the natural order,\nNot something achieved in an instant.\nIf one merely adorns the senses for a moment,\nIt will still flow ceaselessly.\nBut like refined music that lingers in the heart,\nOr bait that delights the palate—\nSuch things may make the traveler pause,\nLinger, and forget their journey,\nYet they can only be enjoyed temporarily,\nNot sustained.\n\nOnly the Dao is without taste—\nNot rich, not sweet, not savory—\nYet it does not leave the palate unsatisfied,\nNor the heart unpleased.\nThis is the supreme flavor within the tasteless,\nBeyond the world’s indulgent flavors.",
      "overlap_context": "ated—\nThere is no need for浩然正气 of utmost vigor and rigidity,\nFilling Heaven and Earth;\nOnly that the mind is free of agitation,\nThe will untethered,\nFeeling the heart as an empty vessel,\nNot possessing even a thought.\nThe mind, like ice melting,\nGenerates no trace of awareness—\nThe body stands firm,\nAs steadfast as a mountain,\nUnshaken, unmoved.\nThus, the spiritual light descends to illuminate the *qixue*,\nSilently observing as the yin-*zhiqi* and the *gonggong* qi converge\nWithin the *danting*.",

      "translated_text": "---\n\nAlthough the Dao has no fixed place nor form,\nIt is difficult to imagine, difficult to grasp.\nThus it is said:\n*\"See it not, hear it not—*\nYet take from it without end,\nUse it without depletion,\nSuch is its nature.\n\nIt truly encompasses Heaven and Earth without excess,\nShapes all things without omission—\nThis is why the Dao is called great.\n\nLet scholars know what to aspire to!\n\nThis speaks of how mortals must emulate the interplay of Heaven and Earth,\nOnly then will the ebb and flow be harmonized,\nAs when refined music stirs the soul,\nOr fragrant bait delights the senses—\nSuch wonders evoke sighs of admiration.\n\nYet its realm is not easily attained.\n\nIf one’s passions are fierce and vitality wanes,\nWithout first descending from the extreme of motion,\nGradually reaching the realm of stillness,\nThen the mortal mind does not die,\nNor does the Dao-mind arise.\nThe common breath never ceases,\nWhile the true breath is unseen.\n\nOnly at the juncture where motion reaches its peak and stillness emerges,\nMust one not intervene with true intent to govern it.\nThis intent is yin—\nIt belongs to the self as *jǐ tǔ* [1].\nSoon, it becomes vague and indistinct,\nAs yin and yang mingle in embrace,\nEntering the boundless void—\nNeither dream nor waking,\nNeither sleep nor awareness.\nWithin this settled stillness,\nA sudden thread of warmth arises,\nMingling and continuous,\nQi flowing freely, spirit harmonized,\nThe two meeting faintly in the *Huángfáng* [2]—\nOn the verge of separation yet already parting,\nParting yet suddenly unified.\nThis is the manifestation of *true lead* [3].\n\nThe heart’s blossoms burst forth,\nWarmth permeates the body,\nThe primordial spirit leaps—\nNot forced by sensation,\nBut naturally arising.\nThus the signs of the Mysterious Pass appear,\nAnd the foundation of the Great Polarity is laid.\n\nAt this moment, only a single point of true heart,\nEmits true intent to gather and contain it.\nThis intent is yang—\nIt belongs to the self as *wù tǔ* [4].\nIn essence, it is one intent,\nYet merely the division of motion and stillness\nInto the two *tǔ* [5] of *wù* and *jǐ*.\n\nFor when the Mysterious Mother remains unopened,\nWithin the chaos of the undifferentiated,\nThis true intent, the master of desirelessness,\nIs called *yin tǔ* [6].\nBut once the Mysterious Mother opens\nAnd the true mechanism appears,\nThen one observes desire\nAnd penetrates its depths—\nCalled *yang tǔ* [7].\n\nOne is the nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nOne is the named mother of all things.\nTo generate Heaven, Earth, man, and all beings,\nIt is this single point of true intent\nThat flows through them all.\n\nThose who practice must wield this true intent to govern their transformations,\nOr else they will be swayed by sensation and stray in thought,\nOr driven by movement and lose their focus.\n\n*\"The Celestial Pass is controlled by me,\nThe Earthly Axis by my heart;\nThe cosmos resides within the body,\nAll transformations spring from the mind—*\nAll are directed by this moment’s luminous awareness,\nWhich governs and sustains them.\n\nThus it is said:\n*If one breath is too early,*\nThen the true mechanism has not yet emerged—\nHarvesting it yields no benefit.\n*If one breath is too late,*\nThen common thoughts have already arisen—\nHarvesting it brings only confusion,\nUnfit as medicine for refining the vital essence.\n\nThis requires great wisdom and great strength,\nOnly then can one discern it clearly\nAnd grasp it firmly\nAs the foundation for attaining transcendence and sainthood.\n\nThough this Mysterious Pass begins with gentle, delicate qi,\nOnly a faint warmth felt rising from the lower *yuán* [8],\nOver time it surges through the body,\nAs if unstoppable in its momentum.\nThe student must recognize it at its subtlest stage,\nWielding true intent to guide it—\nNot the slightest dispersion allowed.\nWith time, the qi-mechanism grows mighty,\nUnrestrained yet steady—\nFollowing its course without interference,\nNeither clinging to nor resisting its flow—\nThus one attains it.\n\nWhen the qi-mechanism is robust and flourishing,\nStillness alone summons the Celestial Mechanism’s movement,\nSwift as thunder—\nEven in the midst of all clamor,\nIt cannot be restrained.\nOne must have a heart of luminous awareness\nTo govern it,\nOr else there will be no distinction.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The State’s Sharpest Tools**\nIf one seeks to *conceal* them,\nFirst, they must be *fully displayed*.\nIf one seeks to *weaken* them,\nFirst, they must be *fully fortified*.\nIf one seeks to *abolish* them,\nFirst, they must be *fully flourished*.\nIf one seeks to *seize* them,\nFirst, they must be *fully granted*.\nThis is called *subtle clarity*.\n\nSoftness overcomes hardness,\nWeakness overcomes strength.\nFish cannot be pulled from the depths.\n\nThe state’s sharpest tools\nMust not be revealed to the people.\n\nHeaven has its fullness and emptiness, its waxing and waning,\nMan has his longevity and brevity, his poverty and abundance—\nThis too is the constant flow of *qi-numbers*.\n\nYet it applies only to the common mortal,\nNot to the sage.\nThe sage possesses the power to *reverse* Heaven and Earth,\nThe virtue to *turn* the Great Polarity—\nNo more than overturning yin and yang,\nAnd acting contrary to the workings of *造化* [9].\n\nJust as autumn arrives,\nAll things withdraw inward,\nYet what is sought is concealed and hard to gather—\nThe sage then *fortifies* the movement of Heaven and Earth’s qi,\n*Strengthens* the vitality of blood and breath.\n\nWhen winter comes,\nAll things decay,\nYet what is sought is withered and hard to revive—\nThe sage then *reignites* the qi’s manifestations,\nAnd *grants* the years as his own.\n\nThis is *both subtle and clear*,\n*Both constant and extraordinary*—\nUnfathomable to those who are not sages.\n\nTo shift from peril to safety,\nFrom chaos to order,\nOnly the divine and courageous can attain this transformation.\n\nYet in truth, their method is but *softness* and *weakness*.\nOnly because of their softness can they overcome hardness,\nOnly because of their weakness can they overcome strength.\n\nWhat is their means?\n*\"Man without essence perishes,\nFish without water dies—*\nOnce pulled from the depths,\nThe water dries and life’s mechanism vanishes.\n\nSimilarly, man’s *yuánzhēn* [10]—\nHis single essence—\nIs but a fragile remnant.\nMan and fish share the same reliance on water,\nYet it is not the dew of Heaven,\nBut the *Dao-creating* depths,\nThe water of the *One Primordial*.\n\nIt flows ceaselessly,\nFrequently nourishing all things.\n\nZhuangzi once said:\n*\"They moisten each other with dew,\nThey breathe upon each other with mist—*\nYet it is better to *forget each other in the rivers and lakes*.\" [11]\nLater generations strayed into false paths,\nTaking the *shaped* and *substantial* essence\nAs the foundation for refining longevity—\nThey failed to grasp the Dao as *thing*,\n*Strong yet moderate, pure yet complete*,\nArising from *vague indistinctness, boundless void, and natural emptiness*.\"",

      "translated_text": "The secrets of alchemical fire and the refined essence of culinary arts are not imparted to the unworthy—only to the saintly master, the utterly sincere, or those who have rendered merit and virtue, who seek the Way with an empty heart and earnestly pursue a teacher. Few are those who can naturally align with the Dao’s favor.\n\nFor the mysteries of Heaven are profound and secret, the weight of Heaven and Earth is supreme, and even the spirits revere them. To recklessly transmit these truths to the unworthy invites calamity upon the Nine Ancestors. It is like the state’s most precious instruments—never to be revealed lightly. Thus, the virtuous man keeps them guarded and concealed. Do the scholars understand this?\n\nThis speaks of those who cultivate the Dao, truly wielding the cosmos in their grasp and nurturing all transformations in their hearts. Yet it is enough to observe the Way of Heaven, to hold fast to its operations, to follow it and take from it, to oppose it and apply it.\n\nIt is not a matter of harboring life’s vitality within the mechanism of destruction—what is called the overwhelming darkness of ultimate Yin, the austere brilliance of ultimate Yang. The overwhelming emerges from Heaven, the austere from Earth. To draw ultimate Yang from ultimate Yin—that is the source of opportunity.\n\nIf one can take the Yang from the black mountain’s cavern, or seize the treasure from the demon’s lair, then one has stolen life’s vitality from within the mechanism of destruction. Yet all this is drawn from the void of Heaven and Earth, seized from the emptiness and stillness of the human form—this is the true essence, not the common essence of the world.\n\nIf one can steal it without losing the proper moment, applying it with a single effort, there will be a corresponding advancement. I urge the scholar to cultivate with gentleness and weakness, to establish virtue and merit, so as to earn the favor of the divine and receive the transmitted incantations of the immortals. Otherwise, even the greatest matters—those that shake Heaven and Earth and move the spirits—will rarely be transmitted, for the laws of Heaven are most strict and cannot be defied.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"If the Dao could be offered to others, then all would offer it to their lords.\nIf the Dao could be advanced to others, then all would advance it to their kin.\nIf the Dao could be given to others, then all would give it to their brothers.\nIf the Dao could be transmitted to others, then all would transmit it to their descendants.*\nYet none of these are possible—why? Because without inner virtue, the Dao cannot stand; without inner mastery, the Dao cannot move.\"\n\nWhen we examine the words of the sages together, we see that the state’s most precious instruments must not be revealed lightly. Later generations of cultivators must not treat the Great Dao as common property, imparting it indiscriminately to all, lest they invite Heaven’s retribution and have no recourse for regret.\n\nThis is the meaning of *public yet not public, not public yet public*—a subtlety beyond the grasp of the unenlightened. Let them take heed.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao’s Constant Non-Action**\n\nThe Dao constantly does nothing yet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it, all things would transform of their own accord.\nWhen transformation stirs to act, I shall restrain it with the nameless Primordial Simplicity.\nThe nameless Primordial Simplicity—it too shall not desire.\nThrough non-desire, stillness prevails, and the world will settle of its own accord.\n\nThough the Dao acts naturally without doing, to fixate on non-action alone becomes the doctrine of stubborn emptiness.\nOne must root oneself in non-action while employing action’s principles—\nnon-action within action, action yet still non-action—\nthus the essence stands firm and the Dao moves,\nthe Dao is complete and virtue is fulfilled.\n\nThis is the constant responsiveness and constant stillness,\nconstant tranquility and constant alertness—\nwhen released, it fills the six directions;\nwhen withdrawn, it hides in the central void.\nAt this moment of boundless indistinction, there is the certainty of seated illumination without omission.\nThough called non-action, action is contained within;\nthough called action, non-action encompasses it.\nThus the Great Dao resides within me, the Great Root ever abides.\n\nEven the most exalted lords and kings—\nif they lack this Dao as their foundation,\nall things become divided and difficult to transform.\nOnly by holding fast to this Dao\ncan the people and all things harmonize in nature and sentiment,\nin resonance and breath,\nnaturally transforming and subtly influencing one another,\nuntil the age of Great Peace takes form.\n\nYet in times of enduring tranquility, ancient ways grow difficult to uphold.\nThis is the inevitable course of human inclination and the fixed order of things—nothing strange in it.\n\nWhen creation becomes frequent and splendor arises, human hearts grow more treacherous, and calamities multiply.\nThis is the fate of Heaven and Earth’s cycles, beyond mortal escape.\nOnly the sage possesses the methods to preserve tranquility and sustain fullness,\nthe strategies for enduring peace and lasting governance.\n\nIn the early ages of culture’s dawn,\nwith non-action, non-doing, non-thought, non-care,\nin the undivided, nameless Primordial Simplicity,\nthey cultivated it within themselves and applied it to others,\nguiding those before and leading those behind,\npurely in accord with Heaven, untainted by human contrivance—\nthus they stabilized the court within and the realm without.\n\nThe first line of *Layered Array*: *\"The sun lingers, beneficial to reside in the true\"*—\nthis is the first stabilization for those in the age of primordial darkness.\nFor even stones conceal jade and mountains gleam,\nwhile waters cradle pearls and rivers enchant.\nIf the Primordial Simplicity itself can exert such influence,\nhow much more so the nameless Primordial Simplicity?\nTo unite all people and things under its governance?\n\nIf it is not returned to its original unity and purity,\nit will never bring the extremes to their proper convergence,\nnor ensure all attain the ease of the ancestral hall.\n\nOnly by being unaware and unknowing,\nby following the Will of the Emperor,\nby forgetting virtue and morality,\nby not recognizing the harmony of Heaven and humanity—\nonly then does one attain this.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The nameless Primordial Simplicity—it too shall not desire.\nThrough non-desire, stillness prevails,\nand the world will settle of its own accord.\"*\nThis is the tranquil simplicity of effortless governance,\nwhere the ruler does not know what to do to transform,\nand the people do not know what to do to respond—\nruler and subjects both rest in the Dao of non-action,\nacting without knowing why, yet acting perfectly.\n\nThus Shun governed through non-action,\nand alone endured through the ages.\n\nFor those who rule over the people,\ncan they not take non-action as their foundation?\n\nThis discourse on governing the world\nfinds its root in non-action.\nThe way of cultivating oneself\nis no different.",

Down to this day, **erroneous teachings** (*fēn fēn zuǒ dào*) abound—beyond reckoning!\n\nWho truly understands that **the Mystic Pass** (*xuān guān*)—a single aperture—is the **essence of Dao/Way cultivation** (*xiū dào zhī yào wù*)?\n\nI now reveal it to people: To **perceive this Mystic Pass** (*rèn qí xuān guān*), one must first endure **great toil and labor** (*dà chén láo*), then **great rest and respite** (*dà xiū xiē*), before one can **penetrate its depths** (*liǎo chè*).\n\nIt is also said:\n*'When thoughts arise, that is the **illness** (*bìng*); when they are not prolonged, that is the **medicine** (*yào*).'*\n*'Lay down the butcher’s cleaver, and instantly become a **Buddha** (*fó*).'*\n\nAll this amounts to nothing more than **dusty emotions and fleeting thoughts** (*chén qíng zá niàn*), swirling and chaotic—when one **awakens within them** (*cóng zhōng yī jué*), that is the **Mystic Pass** (*xuān guān*), the **so-called 'returning to the shore'** (*huí tóu shì àn*).\n\nIt is also said:\n*'The **far shore** (*bǐ àn*) is not distant—**the radiant light of enlightenment** (*huí guāng fǎn zhào*) is itself the **shore**.'*\n\nBut fear arises when, before the **Mystic Pass** is opened (*xuān guān wèi kāi*), one **prematurely imposes contrivance** (*xiān jiā yī fān yì sī qù sūn duó*); or when, after the **Mystic Pass** is opened (*xuān guān jì kāi*), one **adds further fixation** (*yòu jiā yī fān yì sī qù shǒu hù*).\n\nSuch **proliferating thoughts** (*niàn lǜ fēn chéng*) are like **heaven’s original clouds and veils** (*yīn tiān běn wú yún yì*)—when they disperse, the **vast and wondrous landscape of clarity** (*tài kōng miào jǐng*) reveals itself. Yet if one **again imposes smoke and dust** (*zhuǎn lìng qīng míng guǎng dà zhī tiān yīn qí yān chén*), the **clear and boundless heaven** (*qīng míng guǎng dà zhī tiān*) will be **narrowed and constricted** (*yīn qí yān chén*), its **luminosity obscured** (*zhuǎn lìng qīng míng guǎng dà zhī tiān yīn qí yān chén*), and its **darkness unrecognizable** (*hūn àn mò biàn*).\n\nThe **Buddha** said:\n*'One must **abide thus** (*yìng rú shì zhù*), **subduing the heart** (*xiàng fú qí xīn*) in this way.'*\n\nSuch **profound mechanisms** (*xuān jī*) cannot be **approximated by a single word** (*zǒng shī bù dé yī háo nǐ yì*), for approximation is **not true**.

If **darkness creeps in** (*hūn hēi jì luò wū àn dì yù*), one **falls into defilement** (*luò wū àn dì yù*).\n\nIf one **can disperse the clouds and mists** (*néng bō kāi yún wù*), then **blue sky and white sun** (*qīng tiān bái rì*) lie **brightly before** (*míng míng zài qián*).\n\nYet if **thoughts of the world arise** (*rú shēng tā xiǎng*), one **falls into the ordinary man’s rut** (*luò fán fū wō jiù*), not the **foundation of the Immortal** (*fēi shén jiān běn*).\n\nIn summary, the **Immortal’s teachings** (*xiān jiā wú tā miào jué*) have no other **secret** (*miào jué*), only **illuminating the heart and seeing true nature** (*míng xīn jiàn xìng*), which is the **essence of cultivation** (*xiū liàn yào zhǐ*).\n\nIf one asks: *What is **elixir** (*dān*)?*\nIt is the **original qi** (*yuán qì*) within my **elixir field** (*dān zhōng*), the **primordial essence** (*yuán xìng*).\n\nYet this **original qi** (*yuán qì*) is **indivisible from my innate spirit** (*yuán shén*), both **uniting as one** (*huì hé yī chù*), which is the **single point of Heavenly Fate** (*tiān mìng*) before **the return to the Ultimate Supreme** (*fǎn huán tàijí wújí*), when **parents had not yet given birth** (*fù mǔ wèi shēng qián*).\n\nIf one **can establish life through true nature** (*néng yǐ xìng lì mìng*) and **fulfill true nature through Heavenly Fate** (*yǐ mìng liǎo xìng*), then **eternal life without death** (*cháng shēng bù sǐ*) is achieved.\n\nBut if one **seeks alchemy in the Water Realm** (*shuǐ fǔ qiú xuān*), desiring to **cultivate the Golden Elixir** (*chéng jīn yè zhī dān*), yet **lacks the innate breath of the Primordial Spirit** (*bù dé xiān tiān shén xī*), and **harvests, refines, and tempers** (*cǎi qìng pēng liàn*) without **mastering the natural ascent and descent** (*jìn tuì wēn yǎng*)—then the **Primordial Nature** (*xiān tiān yuán xìng*) and the **Primordial Fate** (*xiān tiān yuán mìng*) **cannot spontaneously unite** (*bù néng zǎn wǔ cù liù wéi chéng jīn dān*).\n\nThough this is so, once **Primordial Nature** and **Primordial Fate** are attained (*jì dé yuán xìng yuán mìng yǐ*), if one **lacks true and genuine breath** (*yòu wú zhēn zhèng pēi xī*), it is like **a man and woman in the world who cannot find a matchmaker** (*róng rén shì nán nǚ bù dé méi bǐ*), though they **come and go in intercourse** (*wǎng lái jiāo tōng*), they **cannot form a conjugal bond** (*yì néng jié wéi fū fù*).\n\nThus the **elixir scriptures** (*dān jīng*) say:\n*'**True intent** (*zhēn yì*) is the **matchmaker** (*méi bǐ*).'*\n\nNow it is also said:\n*'**True breath** (*zhēn xī*) is the **matchmaker** (*méi bǐ*).'*\nIs this not **contrary to the ancient scriptures** (*yǐ bù yú gǔ jīng xiāng bèi hū*)?\n\nThose who **do not know True Intent** (*bù zhī zhēn yì zhě liàn dān jiāo hé zhī shén*) are **deceived by the alchemical process** (*liàn dān jiāo hé zhī shén*);

      "translated_text": "If one clings to form and appearance, rushing about in pursuit of myriad affairs,\nentangled by the seven emotions and six desires,\nbound by family, wife, and children,\nreluctant to let go—\nthen the Dao/Way is distant indeed.\n\nDo not speak of external distractions as beyond the Dao—\neven in matters of nurturing the heart and nature,\ncultivating the Dao and refining the Elixir,\nadvancing fire and withdrawing talismans,\ngathering and sealing—\nall these names are but symbolic constructs,\nestablished as methods for later students.\n\nIf the mind harbors even a thread of impurity,\nit becomes an obstruction to the Dao.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* said: *\"Make the many into one, so that no wheel turns without a wheel\"*—\nnot desiring the gleam of jade or the rigidity of stone.\n\nThe Dao is but one Dao—\nwhy should the student seek elsewhere?\n\n**Chapter 40: The Generated from the Non-Generated**\n\n*\"The returning is the movement of the Dao;*\n*the yielding is the function of the Dao.\"*\n\nUnder heaven, all things are generated from the Existent,\nthe Existent from the Non-Generated.\n\nThe Great Dao is complete in all,\nperfect in each—\nwhy seek further?\n\nYet since birth, humans are bound by *qi* and obscured by things,\nlured by knowledge, ensnared by desires—\nthus the Dao is often drowned and lost.\n\nUnless one internally dispels all entanglements,\nexternally repels all disturbances,\nconcentrates the spirit and regulates the breath,\nabandons thought and forgets artifice—\nhow can the first Yang arise,\nhow can the Dao-qi return?\n\nThus it is said: *\"The returning is the movement of the Dao.\"*\nThis is the foundation of Elixir refinement.\n\nWhen the medicine returns to the furnace,\nthe Elixir coarsely forms,\nmercury and lead merge as one—\nday and night, one observes internally,\nand the Golden Elixir emerges.\n\nFrom this point onward, after gathering,\nit flows continuously, ever-present—\nhumble yet descending, yielding yet soft—\nthis is the marvel of the Returned Elixir.\n\nYet it is not only the Returned Elixir that requires this—\nfrom the first step to completion,\none must always focus the mind inwardly,\nconcentrate the *qi* to achieve softness.\n\nFor the Elixir is forged from the unified *qi* of Great Harmony;\nthe cultivator must treat it with humility and moderation.\nThe slightest roughness\nstirs the vulgar fire,\nharming the Dao.\n\nThus it is said: *\"The yielding is the function of the Dao.\"*\n\nThough all things under heaven\nbegin with form, appearance, matter, and principle,\ntheir origin does not arise from the Existent alone.\nThe Sage, when the Great Dao is complete,\nthough manifesting in myriad transformations,\npossesses all things—\nyet first, they gather and refine from the utmost emptiness and non-being,\nthen the great function flows, the vast *qi* fills the two extremes.\n\nIf not refined from non-being,\nhow could one encompass heaven and earth,\nbe so pervasive and boundless?\n\nThus it is said: *\"The Existent is generated from the Non-Generated.\"*\n\nThe essentials of a student’s cultivation:\nFirst, from non-being to being—\nfrom stillness, refining the subtle Yang;\nNext, from being to non-being—\nfrom agitation, returning to tranquility;\nFinally, again from non-being to being—\nmixed and indistinct, self and others forgotten—\nover time, the Yang spirit of three inches emerges,\nthe golden body of sixteen feet.\n\nThus being and non-being alternate endlessly,\ncycling without end.\nThe student must follow this path precisely,\nlest they err.\n\nThis speaks of the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir—\nnothing else, only the true *qi* flowing through the body,\nfilling it entirely.\nIn stillness, like the depths of a pool;\nin motion, like the surge of tides.\nOnly the pure and refined can inwardly illuminate,\nself-examine, and verify—\nthis cannot be exhausted by words.\n\nIf one understands that the moving principle is the root of my generation,\nthen the Elixir of eternal life—\nhow could it be external to this?\n\nMoreover, it is something shared by all—\nno difference, no lack.\nYet because the body moves and essence does not generate,\nthe mind moves and *qi* does not settle—\nthus the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death\nendlessly cycle, without end.\n\nIf one wishes to escape all this,\nthey must first attain nourishment in stillness,\nonly then can they seize the principle in motion,\nrestore the original *qi* of generation.\n\nBut this moving principle is subtle in force,\ndelicate in *qi*—\na moment’s carelessness,\nand suddenly *guǐshuǐ* arises,\ntransforming the original essence into post-heaven form—\nuseless.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Seen, it cannot be used;*\n*used, it cannot be seen.\"*\n\nFrom this single movement onward,\nif gathering is timely,\nthen longevity has its root,\nthe Great Elixir has its foundation.\n\nIf one clings to what is possessed and forces it,\nfixates on what is favored and guards it rigidly—\nthough the medicine may sometimes be obtained,\nthe Elixir may await completion—\nyet the *qi* is not pure and harmonious;\nthus later gathering and refining are flawed,\nand the unified *qi* of Great Harmony\nis injured by the violent vulgar fire.\n\nThe Dao’s most potent Yang must be nurtured with endurance,\nhumility, and softness—\nonly then can the Elixir’s path be fulfilled.\n\nThus the *Tàishàng* taught:\n*\"Dull its sharpness, untangle its chaos,*\n*harmonize its brilliance, blend it with the dust.\"*\n\nThough the Dao moves with *qi*,\nit remains the generation of being from non-being;\nif the Existent is not nourished with yielding,\nit cannot return to the emptiness of heaven—\nhow then could the Dao be complete?\n\nPeople know that the return of Yang is the Dao’s moving principle,\nyet they do not know that returning to the origin,\nthe manifest must revert to the non-manifest—\nfor the manifest is the Dao’s trace,\nthe non-manifest is the Dao’s truth.\n\nUnderstanding this, cultivation need not fear a lack of

      "translated_text": "The things that are easily attained are not beautiful to behold,\nand those hastened to completion are not great vessels.\n\nI can follow the Way step by step, ascending without seeking swift results,\nnot reckoning shallow gains, abiding long in its practice—\nthus great attainment is surely possible, why should I feel deficient within?\n\nIndeed, the Dao is subtle beyond words, naturally elusive.\nIt is best described as vague and indistinct.\n\nI can attain to the utmost emptiness and profound stillness,\nthen the great sound arises without sound,\nand the great form manifests without form!\n\nIts application spans the four seas and remains ever valid,\nits transmission through ten thousand generations knows no end—\nhow could it merely be esteemed in one age,\nwhile failing to shine through all future generations?\n\nThe *Shijing* says:\n*\"There is none there who is evil,\nAnd here is none who is not pure.\"*\n\nThe Dao’s establishment and practice truly possess such divine and wondrous qualities.\n\nBetween these, who is the doer and who is the recipient?\nIt is also said:\n*\"To practice the Dao is to lend virtue generously and complete it.\"*\n\nThis is the way of those who embrace the Dao in the world—\ntheir use is never insufficient,\nthey give to all things without depletion,\nand even beyond the dusty boundaries of existence, they have abundance.\nMoreover, they enable the transformation of all things to flourish,\ntruly the highest adept.\n\nThe **Tàishàng** warns against those who do not conceal their light nor cultivate obscurity,\nwho establish virtue and refine the self—\nthose who, upon gaining even a little, boast and exalt themselves.\n\nWhile the **Five Aggregates** remain unemptied and the **Six Dusts** uncleansed,\nthey are like a house roofed with straw and thatch,\nfire that still relies on fuel to burn.\n\nIf one only cultivates oneself without seeking harmony with others,\nthey drift aimlessly, returning to the realm of **Nonbeing**—\nthe boundless wilds where nothing exists.\nEven if external harm comes,\nit is like lighting a fire in empty space—\nit will eventually extinguish itself.\n\nSuch cultivation is true cultivation of the self.\nOnly when done thusly\ncan people and people both rest in peace within the Dao’s boundless expanse,\notherwise, they gain nothing from the Dao\nand instead invite blame.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Being without yet appearing as having,\nemptiness without yet seeming full,\nrestraint without yet becoming expansive.\"*\n\nHis insight into what others despise is fitting indeed.\n\nFor those who cultivate the Dao in this manner,\nthey can be free from the need to seek external validation,\nand also avoid the distress of external blame.\n\n**Chapter 42: Loss and Gain**\nThe Dao gives birth to **One**,\n**One** gives birth to **Two**,\n**Two** gives birth to **Three**,\n**Three** gives birth to all things.\n\nAll things carry **yin** within and embrace **yang**,\nand the **succession of qi** brings harmony.\n\nWhat people detest are the lonely, widowed, and childless,\nyet kings and nobles prize such titles.\n\nThus, some things are diminished yet gain,\nwhile others are increased yet lose.\n\nWhat people revere, I also teach:\n*\"The strong and arrogant will not meet their end.\"*\n\nI shall take this as my guiding principle.\n\nThe Daoists, from beginning to end, refine and cultivate,\nholding **emptiness and nonexistence** as their ultimate essence.\n\nThe **Primordial Heavenly Sovereign**,\nwhose Dao-name is **Emptiness-Naturalness**,\nexpresses this very meaning.\n\nFrom emptiness comes reality—\nthis is called **true reality**.\nFrom nonexistence comes existence—\nthis is called **true existence**.\n\nIf one does not embrace emptiness nor nonexistence,\nnot only are the **Seven Emotions and Six Desires** stifled,\nbut the true spirit and original nature are also blocked,\nleaving no means to respond to all things or transform the **yang spirit**.\n\nEven if one practices **observing emptiness and illumination**,\nand clings with even a trace of stubborn resolve,\nit is still a case of the mind controlling the mind,\ndirectly obscuring the original face beyond recognition.\n\nIn summary, **emptiness and nonexistence** are the Dao’s essence,\n**harmonious succession** is its function.\nIf humans can align with this,\nthen the Dao is nearly attained.\n\nThe **Tàishàng** says: *\"The Dao gives birth to One\"*—\nwhat does the Dao possess?\nOnly **emptiness**.\n\nYet within the utmost emptiness,\na single **qi** stirs—\nand heaven and earth are born.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"There was a **cosmic unity** before heaven and earth were formed.\"*\n\nBefore the **Ultimate Void**,\nit was **mixed and chaotic**—\njust this one emptiness.\n\nWhen it moves, it becomes **yang**;\nwhen it stills, it becomes **yin**—\nthis is the *\"**Great Polarity** of the *Yijing*, from which the **Two Complements** arise.\"*\n\nThis is the saying:\n*\"The Dao gives birth to One, One gives birth to Two.\"*\n\nIn the human body,\nit is within the **subtle and indistinct**,\nthat **One Awareness** splits open—\nthe opening and closing of **Heaven and Earth**,\nthe ebb and flow of **qi**—\nstillness and condensation form **yin** and **essence**;\nmovement and circulation form **yang** and **qi**.\n\nIf there is no **true intention** of the **Primordial Spirit** to govern them,\nthen **yin** and **yang** scatter in disorder,\nand there is no way to generate life and attain the Dao.\n\nIt is clear that between the **two qi of yin and yang**,\nthe **Primordial Spirit** and **true intention** are greatly relied upon to maintain their balance—\nthis is the saying: *\"Two gives birth to Three.\"*\n\nFrom this,\n**one yin and one yang**,\n**one movement and one stillness**,\n**qi** flows in transformation,\nits sovereignty remains unchanged—\nand all things are born endlessly—\nthis is the saying: *\"Three gives birth to all things.\"*\n\nSome say:\n*\"Heaven One generates water, yet metal also generates water;\nEarth Two generates fire, yet wood also generates fire;\nHeaven Three generates wood, yet water also generates wood;\nEarth Four generates metal, yet soil also generates metal.\"*\n\nUsing the **Five Phases** to explain the **Primordial Sovereign’s** meaning of *\"One, Two, Three, and all things\"*—\nthis is all strained interpretation;\nit is not as clear as the theory:\nthe Dao is the **Ultimate Void**,\nOne is the **Great Polarity**,\nTwo are **yin and yang**,\nHeaven One and Earth Two combine to form Three—\nthis is the explicit reasoning.\n\n*\"All things carry yin within and embrace yang,\nand the **succession of qi** brings harmony\"*\nclearly shows the Dao as the **Primordial Qi of Emptiness-Naturalness**,\ntransforming into **yin and yang**,\nand all things are born from **yin and yang**.\n\n**Succession** means **central harmony**—\nif **yin and yang** lack this central **qi**,\nthen the center has no master, and the master is unsettled.\nEven the birth of things is difficult,\nlet alone cultivating the Dao?\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth in their **primordial state**,\nall things become **pure and complete**.\"*\n\nIt is evident that the **Three Treasures**—**essence, qi, spirit**—\nmust all be fully realized,\nso that **yin and yang** unite with the **Great Polarity** and become inseparable.\n\nIf **yin and yang** are distinct yet the **Great Polarity** is lost,\nthen the **transformative power** falters,\nand the generative mechanism of all things is extinguished.\nGenerally speaking,\neven in refining the Dao and alchemical elixirs,\none cannot do without **true yin and true yang**,\nbut without the **Great Harmony’s Primordial Qi**,\nthe elixir cannot be formed,\nand the Dao is difficult to attain—\nfor the Dao is originally the **Great Harmony’s single qi**, structured and complete.\n\nGenerating humans or immortals\nis but one principle,\nthe only difference lies in whether one follows or opposes it.",

feels **fullness**, not **deficiency**;\none only feels **advantage**, not **shortcoming**.\n\nThus the **Supreme Sage** said:\n*\"The less one has, the more one gains;\nthe more one has, the more

**no attainment**, that is **true attainment**.\nThus, the higher the **Dao**,\nthe lower the heart;\nthe greater the **virtue/power**,\nthe more humble the will—\nthis alone aligns with the **Dao** perfectly.\n\nIf one has even a slight excess,\none boasts arrogantly, proud and haughty,\ncontemptuous of others, domineering—\nthen the absence of **Dao** and **virtue/power** is evident.\n\nThus the **Supreme Sage** said:\n*\"In learning, one gains daily;\nin the **Dao**, one diminishes daily—\ndiminish again, diminish,\nuntil one reaches **nothingness**.\"*\nOnly then does one attain.\n\nThe

**emptiness**,\nand the **work** reaches **forgetting**—\nthis is progress.\nWhen **forgetting** is forgotten,\none has entered the realm of **transformation**.\n\nFor the scholar of the

**Supreme Sage** acts without action, names without seeing, achieves without doing.\n\nThe **virtuous** (*junzi*) possesses all things within,\nyet without stepping beyond his courtyard refines his being.\nThe shifts of the world, the changes of hearts,\nand the mechanisms of preserving life while extinguishing ruin,\nof reversing chaos into order—\nall are crystal-clear within his mind.\nIs this achieved through mere craft or calculation?\nTruly, for **qi** and self share a single source:\nto exhaust the logic of one’s own nature\nis to encompass the logic of all under Heaven.\nThus, one knows the world without leaving home.\n\nThe ancients shaped creation through mind alone,\nwithout opening windows to conceal their radiance,\nyet the silent **Emperor** (*Dì*) and the ceaseless **Heavenly Mandate** (*Tiānmìng*)\nand the mysteries of growth, decline, and transformation—\nall are fully illuminated within.\nIs this gained through mere conjecture?\nIt is because **Heaven and humanity are one continuum** (*tiānrén yīguàn*):\nto cultivate one’s own life\nis to align with the **Heavenly Command** (*Tiānmìng*).\nThus, one perceives the **Dao/Way** of Heaven without peering through windows.\n\nIf one wanders distant lands, inquiring into the world’s affairs,\nor consorts with noble friends, probing the subtleties of **Heavenly Mandate**—\none may gain some knowledge.\nBut I fear that if one seeks knowledge outside oneself,\nrather than within,\none’s understanding, though gained, will be lesser than what lies near.\nHence it is said:\n*\"The farther one goes, the less one knows.\"*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** shines brightly between doors and windows—\nwhy abandon what is near to chase what is far?\nMencius said:\n*\"Speaking near yet pointing far is good speech;\nupholding brevity while applying broadly is good **Dao/Way**.\"*\nReflecting thus, the more one studies, the nearer yet farther it becomes,\nthe more concise yet expansive it grows—\nhow can the near and the concise be neglected?\n\nThus the **Supreme Sage** embraces **Oneness** (*yī*), containing the three,\nobserving emptiness while cultivating stillness,\nnever leaving his door or hut,\nnever treading the dusty markets,\ndwelling among wood and stone,\nroaming with deer and swine,\nnot moving a step, not befriending a soul—\nyet it seems lonely.\nBut when the spirit is settled, wisdom arises;\nthough he does not act, his deeds surpass those who do.\nThough he lacks knowledge, his insight surpasses those who know.\nCommon folk take what they see as their pursuit,\nbut the **Sage** does not seek what is seen—\nthus, day and night, he remains steadfast (*qiánqián*),\nresting thought and abandoning artifice\nin the unseen and unheard,\nguarding against deceit and contrivance in the unmanifest.\nWith only inner knowing and no outward perception—\nit seems as if in utter darkness—\nyet the **Ultimate** (*Wújí*) gives rise to life.\nThough unseen, it is ever manifest;\nthough unnamed, it is ever present.\n\nAs for the myriad beings of the world,\nthe hidden realms of spirits and ghosts—\nall are governed by this **Uncontrived** **Dao/Way**.\nWith order and essence,\nbeginning and ending are fulfilled.\nWhat is feared is being ensnared by perception,\nclinging to names and forms,\nboasting of achievements,\nhoarding insights—\nthus the mind scatters, unable to unify in **virtue** (*dé*).\nThe heart becomes cluttered, unlike the **Great Void** (*Tàixū*).\nHence the **Dao/Way** fails to manifest, and **virtue** remains unchanged.\nNo wonder one exhausts oneself in vain across lifetimes, gaining nothing.\n\nIf applied to governing the world,\none cannot harmonize with **Heavenly Principle** (*lǐ*) to achieve natural unity—\nwithout action, the world would spontaneously align.\nIf applied to cultivating the self,\none cannot refine the **Void** and merge with the **Dao/Way**—\nwithout action, the body would naturally attain true transformation.\nWhat use is mere external seeking?\n\nThus the **virtuous** must be ever vigilant in solitude,\nfor the essence of humanity and the origin of **Heavenly Mandate**\nlie in what is sought yet naturally known.\nThis speaks of the **Dao/Way** taking **Uncontrived** as its foundation,\n**solemn vigilance** as its key—\nthus, **Uncontrived** yet nothing remains undone,\n**Unknowing** yet nothing remains unknown.\nYet this is not the **Uncontrived** of withered wood and dead ashes.\nEarlier, I spoke of *\"all phenomena as emptiness, one spirit alone illuminating\"*—\nthis is the true intent;\nand *\"one awakening sets motion in motion, one **Yang** gives rise to life\"*—\nthis is the **Original Qi** (*yuánqì*).\nGathering medicine or refining elixirs\nis but the cultivation of these two—**nature** (*xìng*) and **life** (*mìng*).\nWithout true intent, where would **nature** depend?\nWithout true **qi**, how could **life** be refined?\nTo gather true intent with true **qi**,\nwhen the two merge into one,\nit returns to the **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*)’s beginning—\nthis is called the **Elixir** (*dān*).\n\nWithin **Uncontrived**, there must still be action and doing;\nwithin **Unknowing**, there must still be knowing and awareness—\nonly then does one not fall into emptiness or cling to form.\nWhen cultivation deepens, emptiness becomes form,\nand form becomes emptiness.\nIn time, both are forgotten,\nand one merges seamlessly with **Dao/Way**—\nthus attaining its utmost harmony.\n\nIf one does not know the **Dao/Way** of humanity,\none may still perceive the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\nConfucius said:\n*\"How does Heaven speak?\nThe four seasons proceed, and all things are born\"*—\nthis is the essence of **Uncontrived**.\n\nThis is the **Supreme Dao/Way**.\n**Uncontrived** is **Heavenly Nature** (*tiānxìng*),\n**Action** is **Heavenly Mandate** (*tiānmìng*);\n**Unknowing** is the **Original Spirit** (*yuánshén*),\n**Awareness** is the **Original Qi** (*yuánqì*).\nBetween Heaven and Earth, there must be both two and one\nto achieve transformation—\nboth divine and not divine,\nnot divine yet divine—\nthus attaining the marvel of **Oneness** within duality,\ndivinity within transformation.\nThis cannot be exhausted by words.\nIt lies with you, the cultivator:\nnurture the **Void** and the **Spiritual** (*xūlíng*),\nconstantly guard the **Void** and the **Awakened** (*xūxǐng*).\nThus **nature** and **life** endure,\nand the **Great Dao/Way** may be fulfilled.\n\nDo not confuse **Uncontrived** with **Action**—\neach side taken in isolation,\nthough seemingly orthodox,\nleads to divergent paths.\nConsider this well.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight: *Daily Diminishing for the Dao/Way, Daily Increasing for Learning* (*Wéidào rì sǔn, wéixué rì yì*)**\n\nTo take the world requires **Uncontrived**—\nyet when affairs arise, it is insufficient to take the world.\nScholars

said: *\"To cultivate learning is to daily increase.\"*\n\nBut for the Dao/Way, the reverse holds true.\nIf one takes wide reading and mastery of ancient texts as their pursuit,\nyet fails to turn inward, to self-reflection and single-minded guarding,\nthen though their knowledge expands and insights multiply,\ntheir mind will scatter and their spirit grow chaotic.\nThough learning increases, the Dao/Way diminishes—\nuntil, in time, they are lost in the undifferentiated *Taiji*,\ndrowned in the boundless, with nothing remaining.\n\nThus the cultivator of the Dao/Way must proceed like peeling a banana leaf or unraveling silk—\nthe more they strip away, the less remains;\nthe more they draw forth, the more it vanishes,\nuntil they reach the realm of *wu-wu* (non-being of

present;\nwhen dispersed, it is absent.\nDesire one, and it is one;\ndesire ten thousand, and it is ten thousand.\nThe sun, moon, and stars revolve at my command;\nwinds, clouds, thunder, and rain

external,\ntheir heart wanders to no external schemes—\nonly then can they respond with spontaneity,\nand take the world as effortlessly as turning the palm.\n\nOtherwise, chaos reigns—\nthe more affairs multiply, the more the mind is disordered;\nthe more disordered, the more the spirit grows dim.\nBefore the enemy even arrives, they cannot remain composed;\nat the first clash, their ranks dissolve into confusion.\nTo hope for victory in such a battle is surely difficult.\nWhat then of pacifying the eastern barbarians while the western nomads rise anew—\none crisis unresolved, another erupting—\nif they do not know to remain still to govern movement,\nor rest to await exertion,\nfew escape defeat and ruin.\nAnciently, those who fled in defeat,\nwhose cities fell in ruin,\nall

facing overwhelming odds,\ntheir courage shatters—\nnone dare stand their ground.\nOnly by treating affairs as though they were nonexistent,\ncasting aside all entanglements,\nand maintaining single-minded inner illumination—\nlike Zhuge Liang amidst a million troops,\nhis headgear and fan untroubled,\neffortlessly at ease—\ncould he preserve the western Shu,\nprolonging the Han’s survival in its hour of peril.\nHad his mind been entangled in affairs,\nhis inner clarity would have faltered,\nhis spirit lost its master—\nlike Xu Shu, distracted by his mother’s return to Cao Cao,\nunable to offer further counsel,\nand thus failing to aid the emperor in restoring the realm.\nHow could such a one take the world?\n\nThis speaks to those cultivating the Dao/Way:\nif they see only increase, not diminution,\ntheir mind grows clouded and the Dao/Way fails to coalesce.\nThus it is said: *\"Virtue/power is singular—\nwhen divided into two or three, it grows dim.\"*\nOnly by refining and forgetting in turn,\nforgetting and refining anew,\ncan they avoid becoming obstacles to the Dao/Way.\nIf memories persist, clamoring without cease,\nthey become the true concern of our path.\nThus they must gradually dissolve and vanish into absolute nothingness—\nonly then is *xing* (nature) fully realized.\n\nThen, from nothingness, true being arises,\nand one can move unseen among ghosts and spirits,\ntransformations beyond measure.\nThe text speaks of *\"the world\"* as a metaphor for the Dao/Way,\n*\"taking the world\"* as cultivating it,\n*\"having affairs\"* and *\"no affairs\"* as *having-for* and *Uncontrived*.\nIf one remains pure and Uncontrived,\nthey are in harmony with the primordial *qi*—\nwhat difficulty is there in attaining the Dao/Way?\nThis is the essence of *taking the world*.\n\nBut if they manipulate *having-for*,\nentirely relying on later-heaven exertion,\nthey fall into tangential paths—\nthis is the opposite of *taking the world*.\n\nSome may ask: *\"How can gathering herbs or refining elixirs be Uncontrived?\"*\nKnow this: when *qi* ascends, follow its ascent—\nnot by first intending to ascend.\nWhen *qi* descends, follow its descent—\nnot by first intending to descend.\nEven if gathering is exhaustive,\nif refining is manifold,\nit is still pure spontaneity,\nwith not a trace of contrivance—\nthough it appears

one principle.\nThough the world be vast, it is contained by sincerity;\nthough the people be many, they are gathered by righteousness.\nEven among the wise and deceitful, the loyal and false—\nhowever unequal they may be—\nthe sage is impartial, treating all with equal kindness.\nWith open sincerity and public fairness,\nplacing his heart before theirs,\nhe unifies the world under one principle—\nand the people daily improve without knowing it.\nHow profound is this transformation beyond mere teaching!\nHow could later methods—\nexhorting filial piety, urging loyalty,\ndemonstrating rites and righteousness—\never compare?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"He blends the world’s hearts in tranquil unity.\"*\n\nFor he views the world as one family,\nunites all under heaven as one body—\nhis compassion all-embracing,\nhis unity with the people complete.\nThus the people revere his virtue, embrace his kindness,\nlove him as parents, honor him as a deity,\nlook to him as teacher and guardian.\nAll they hear or see is measured against the sage’s voice and bearing—\nnothing else exists in their awareness.\nHence it is said:\n*\"The people fix their ears and eyes upon him.\"*\n\nIf the people’s expectation of the sage is thus,\nwhat else could the sage be but—\ngoverning the multitude with gentleness,\nleading them with tenderness,\nlike parents to children:\nwhether wise or foolish, virtuous or base,\nhis love is equal;\nhis guidance sincere.\n\nIf such governance fails to transform the world,\nit has never been.\n\nThus is the way of **non-action**.\n\nCompared to those who rely on speech and law,\nthe difference is as vast as heaven and earth.\n\nIn the *Classic*, **\"the sage\"** signifies the heart,\n**\"the world\"** signifies the body.\nThe sage’s cultivation of self\ndoes not exceed nurturing the **original spirit** and **original qi**.\n\nYet humans possess an original spirit and a mundane spirit;\noriginal qi and

mind—\neven if stray thoughts linger,\nI still meet them with an even mind.\nIf the original spirit fails to appear,\nit has never been.\n\nOnce the original spirit arises,\ncultivation has its master—\nthen one must quietly guard the **elixir field**,\nnurturing the original qi.\nIf the original qi moves of its own accord,\nI meet it with harmonious breath—\neven if mundane breath does not yet cease,\nI still meet it with harmonious breath.\nIf the original qi fails to generate,\nit will not.\n\nKnow this:\nThe original spirit is obscured by the mundane spirit,\nlike a bright mirror long sealed by dust—\nunless diligently polished, how could it suddenly shine?\nThe original qi is drowned by mundane breath,\nlike white silk stained by oil—\nunless thoroughly cleansed, how could it return to purity?\nYet if at this point a restless mind arises,\nor an evil thought stirs,\nyou seek the original spirit as essence,\nwhile the mundane mind only grows stronger.\nTo seek enlightenment—\nis it not difficult?\nTo seek the original qi as master,\nwhile mundane breath only intensifies—\nhow could this be easy?\n\nYet the sage’s governance of the world\ndoes not distinguish good from evil, true from false—\nhe treats all with a single heart of kindness and sincerity:\nthe good he affirms as good,\nthe evil he also affirms as good;\nthe faithful he affirms as faithful,\nthe faithless he also affirms as faithful.\nA childlike purity, complete in his embrace.\nThis is the **void**, this is the **Way**.\nFrom the void, spirit naturally arises;\nfrom the Way, qi naturally flows.\nThings unfold spontaneously, without contrivance.\nOtherwise, if the heart is not void,\nthe Way does not yet exist—\nhow could the spirit then manifest,\nor the Way’s qi endure?\n\nCultivating self and governing the world—\nthe Way is one, the principle is singular.\nTo know governance is to know self-cultivation;\nto grasp external causes is to grasp inner truth.\nThus, using this principle to illustrate,\nits instruction to learners is profound and direct.\n\nThe student must diligently guard the true and constant,\nskillfully nurture the void—\nthen the original spirit and original qi\nwill naturally return.\n\nIf a stray thought arises,\nor a foreign breath stirs,\nfear that the more you cultivate, the farther the Way recedes.\nLet the student

      "translated_text": "「And what of the Sage who refines their nature and establishes their life’s purpose over years?\nWhen gathered, they take form; when dispersed, they become *qi*.\nThe sun and moon revolve at my command,\nThe winds and thunders obey my bidding.\n\nThough the tiger and rhinoceros rage fiercely,\nAnd blades though sharp and weapons though mighty,\nHow can they reach the *formed*?\nOnly the *formless* can subdue the *formed*—\nHow can the *formed* ever constrain the *formless*?\n\nAlas! All things with form have birth and death,\nBut the Sage, formless, transcends birth and death—\nIndeed, they master the primal source of life and death.\nTo all things, this appears as birth and death,\nYet who would dare to harm them?\nThis is the tenfold fullness of Heaven and Earth,\nThe threefold interplay of three yang and three yin.\n\nHumans inherit the three yang of *Buqian* (乾) and meet the three yin of *Bunkun* (坤) at death.\nThis is the eternal principle of Heaven and Earth—\nOne yin and one yang, bending and stretching,\nComing and going, cyclically interdependent.\nWithout yin, there is no yang;\nWithout death, there is no life.\n\nThus, retreat and concealment are but ways\nTo nurture the profound *virtue/power* of life’s continuity.\nYet in abandoning themselves to passion and desire,\nDestroying principle and losing their humanity,\nTheir death differs from others—\nFor those who follow yin-yang’s order,\nAre embraced by *Taiji*’s undifferentiated wholeness,\nAnd move with the true *qi* of the two polarities.\n\nBut those who defy *zào huà*’s methods—\nTheir original *yuánqì* (元气) is lost,\nAnd they succumb to excessive *yīnxié* (阴邪).\nHence they say, *“Ten and three”* (十有三).\n\nTen is the fullness, the Dao’s embrace of Heaven and Earth;\nThree is Heaven’s One generating Water, Earth’s Two generating Fire,\nHeaven One and Earth Two merging into Water and Fire’s trio.\nMoreover, Heaven’s One generates Water,\nMetal is born from Water;\nEarth’s Two generates Fire,\nWood is born from Fire—\nThus the four *xiàng* (象) are complete.\n\nSoil has no fixed place,\nRoaming through the four *xiàng*,\nAnd when the purest essence of *Taiji* rules\nThe *qi* of yin-yang,\nAnd governs the mechanisms of *zào huà*,\nIt becomes *Wújí* (无极) in Heaven and Earth.\n\nYet in the human body, *Taiji*’s principle reveals itself:\nAt rest, as the *yuánshén* (元神) of silence and scentlessness, undivided;\nIn motion, as the *liángzhīliángnéng* (良知良能) of timely action and true intention—\nTogether, they form the *Wǔxíng* (五行).\n\nThis is the shared *virtue/power* of life’s continuity,\nIn all things—when present, it dwells in them;\nWhen absent, it returns to the boundless *Tàixū* (太虚).\nIt neither increases nor decreases with life and death of beings.\n\nThus the adept at preserving life,\nEntering their chamber to meditate in stillness,\nCaptures the moment when one yang returns,\nHolding it to ascend, to descend,\nAnd to return to the furnace for nourishment—\nNinefold transformations of the elixir,\nTenfold perfection of the fire’s *candidate* (候).\n\n“High is the Dao, and dragons and tigers submit;\nGreat is *virtue/power*, and spirits grow tender”—\nWhat harm can the tiger’s horn, the rhinoceros’ claws,\nOr blades and weapons inflict?\n\nObserve the ancients:\nIn secluded mountain depths,\nRhinoceroses gathered in herds,\nWolves consorted in packs,\nYet willingly tamed, content to roam freely—\nNot a few such tales exist.\n\nOr lone horsemen charging forth,\nTribes surrendering their hearts,\nDiscarding armor, abandoning spears,\nRevering them as divine,\nLoving them like kin.\n\nAnd further still—\nFilial piety moving Heaven,\nBandits yielding sincerity;\nStrict virtue and chastity,\nCausing rogues to pause in guilt—\nAll from the *virtue/power* of utmost sincerity,\nWhich stirs them deeply.\n\nObserve again:\nThe rhinoceros cannot strike with its horn,\nThe tiger cannot place its claws,\nThe blade cannot find its target—\nThis is no false claim.\n\nFor the essence of *lǐqì* (理气) is not the yin-yang of *zào huà*.\nI can remain tranquil and serene,\nReaching the boundless light,\nYet what birth and death can touch me?\n\nThose who know birth and death are but traces;\nI can erase these traces,\nReturning to the undifferentiated fate,\nThe harmonious Heaven—\nThough traces of life and death persist,\nThe principle remains everlasting, unobstructed.\nWhy then rejoice in life’s fleeting pleasure,\nOr dread death’s inevitable sorrow?\n\nThe ancient Sages sacrificed life for righteousness,\nAnd died to fulfill *rén* (仁).\nTo them, the knife and saw were commonplace,\nAnd the cauldron’s boiling a trivial matter—\nWhy was this so?\nBecause they had attained the inner truth,\nAnd feared nothing externally.\n\nHence it is said, *“No place of death.”*\n\nMoreover, the fullness of Water is seven,\nCombined to make thirteen as well.\n**Chapter 51: Revering the Dao and Honoring Virtue/Power**\n\nThe Dao brings forth life,\n*Virtue/power* sustains it,\nThings take form through it,\nAnd circumstances perfect it.\nThus all things reverence the Dao\nAnd honor *virtue/power*.\n\nThe Dao’s reverence,\nThe *virtue/power*’s nobility—\nNone command them, yet they persist naturally.\nSo the Dao brings forth life,\n*Virtue/power* sustains it,\nNurtures and fosters it,\nPerfects and matures it,\nAnd nourishes it with care.\nLife is given yet not possessed,\nAction is done yet not relied upon,\nGrowth is guided yet not controlled—\nThis is called *mystic virtue/power*.\n\nThe Dao has no name,\nNo name means no limit.\nThis is the pure *qi* of emptiness,\nThe shared source of life’s continuity in Heaven, Earth, and all beings.\nFor it is neither having nor lacking,\nNeither vast nor small,\nYet encompasses all things without exception—\nHence it is called *“Great Virtue/Power.”*\n\nThe Dao is the *Taiji* shared by all things;\n*Virtue/power* is the *Taiji* inherent in each thing.\nThus all things draw life from it,\nRooted in the principle of the boundless void,\nThe *yuánqì* (元气) vast and all-pervading.\nNo matter great or small, hidden or revealed,\nAll depend on this Dao for life,\nAnd entrust their essence to its fate.\n\nWithin it, yin-yang harmonize their principles,\nAnd the sun and moon revolve in its depths—\nLike grasses and trees:\nResting in day and night,\nNourished by rain and dew,\nAnd thus strengthened at their roots.\n\nThis is the Dao bringing forth life,\nAnd *virtue/power* sustaining it.\nAll things, receiving this nurturing,\nAre transformed by its influence—\nFirst they take on *qi*,\nWith time they develop form.\nThus they grow secretly, steadily,\nDay by day, month by month,\nUntil humans become fully human,\nAnd things become fully what they are—\nWithout flaw or omission.\n\nThus all things reverence the Dao,\nAnd honor *virtue/power*.\nFor the Dao is the principle of life’s birth,\nWithout which there is no means

*virtue/power*?\nYet both are granted from Heaven,\nAnd take things as their occasion.\nNo need for forced action—\nNaturally aligned with the Way.\nWithout contrivance, effortlessly embodying *virtue/power*.\nNo one commands it, no one ordains it,\nYet ever thus—\nNothing compelled, all returns to the natural.\n\nWhat is this Dao?\nThe grand central path of Heaven and Earth,\nThe essential key for sages to attain immortality and enlightenment.\nIf one seeks to cultivate the Golden Immortal,\nHow else but through the Dao?\n\nThus, one concentrates the spirit in the void,\nUnites the *qi* in the boundless.\nAt the juncture of emptiness and stillness,\nIn the faint and obscure,\nThe primordial true *qi* emerges—\nThis is the birth of the Dao.\n\nOnce the Dao is born,\nThen nourish it in stillness,\nDraw from its motion;\nHold it straight within,\nAnd all phenomena dissolve into emptiness.\nEver grasp, ever preserve—\nDo not forget, do not abandon—\nThen the foundation of *virtue/power* is established.\n\nYet if one follows the Dao to bring it forth,\nThe Dao will grow daily;\nIf one relies on *virtue/power* to nurture it,\nThen *virtue/power* will flourish daily.\nTo grow and nurture—\nLike things thriving and multiplying,\nUntil autumn arrives and ripening is inevitable.\n\nWhen the Dao is thus complete and ripe,\nAnd its cultivation and protection continue—\nWhat difference is there from humanity?\n\nEssentially, it is but returning to the initial state before form,\nAnd restoring the undivided truth.\n\nIn truth, what is this \"life\"?\nIts life is the self-moving *qi* of the void.\nWhy claim it as mine to possess?\n\nEven when the signs of life appear—\nInternally circulating the Heavenly Canopy,\nExternally pushing the Dipper’s handle—\nIt seems like action,\nYet purely entrusted to nature,\nWithout the slightest arrogance or contrivance—\nIs this not effortless yet not relying on effort?\n\nTo cultivate thus,\n*Virtue/power* advances daily,\nThe Dao grows daily,\nAnd natural transformation lies within reach—\nHeaven and Earth governed by the mind—\nThough myriad changes arise,\nThey cannot disrupt the steadfastness of one who holds the essence.\n\nThis is the unruling ruler,\nExceeding all rulers—\nIs this not the profound and distant *virtue/power*?\n\nThis speaks of one who steals Heaven and Earth’s primordial *qi*\nAs the foundation for the elixir,\nThen nurtures, sustains, stores, and grows it,\nReturning to the original Heaven—\nThus attaining the Dao.\n\nYet to steal Heaven and Earth’s primordial *qi*,\nOne must first recognize the boundless gateway of the formless.\n\nWhere is this gateway?\nBefore Hongmeng’s division,\nAt the dawn of Heaven and Earth,\nIn the indistinct and chaotic—\nA sudden stirring,\nAnd the true mechanism moves of its own accord.\nThis is where the primordial *qi* resides,\nAnd the cultivator must gather it as the elixir’s seed.\n\nLike when the myriad yins congeal and close,\nAll things retreat and wither—\nYet when winter solstice’s yang returns,\nThe Dao is born.\n\nThus, one refines essence and preserves life,\nNurturing within the Eight Trigram Furnace.\nOver time, the *qi* swells and fills,\nLike all things flourishing in summer—\nThis is the accumulation.\n\nOnce things are full and ripe,\nFlowers bloom into fruit.\nLike autumn’s harvest of treasures complete.\n\nIn the human body,\nNurturing the embryo to return to its original form—\nThis is completion and ripening.\n\nWhen things are ripe,\nThey return to their origin—\nLike winter’s grasses and trees bearing fruit,\nLeaves falling back to roots,\nReturning to the three years of suckling,\nNine years of wall-gazing,\nRefining the pure yang body,\nAchieving the golden-colored *dharma-body*—\nOne must release all entanglements,\nHold no thoughts,\nEmpty and hollow,\nSilently awaiting the yang’s birth.\n\nThough life arises,\nIt was originally self-existent—\nYet one must not cling to it as one’s own.\n\nEven with techniques of ascent and descent,\nAdvancement and retreat—\nThese are still contrivances,\nYet all must follow the natural movement of *qi*,\nWithout the slightest force or coercion—\nIs this not effortless yet not relying on contrivance?\n\nAs *virtue/power* advances daily,\nThe Dao grows daily,\nAnd the *yin* and *yang* forces refine,\nBathing and sealing firmly—\nAll are governed by the original spirit within.\n\nThis is having a master yet no master,\nRuling yet no ruler—\nHow profound and distant is this Dao!\nThus it is called *\"Playful Virtue.\"*\n\n**Chapter 52: The Origin of the World**\nThe world has a beginning,\nWhich becomes the mother of the world.\nHaving obtained its mother,\nOne knows its children;\nHaving known its children,\nOne returns to guard its mother—\nAnd thus avoids peril throughout life.\n\nSeal the *yui* (mouth),\nClose the gate,\nAnd labor no more for life.\nOpen and return to clarity—\nNo harm will come to the body—\nThis is called *\"Following the Constant.\"*\n\nThe Golden Elixir—what is it?\nNothing but the primordial true *qi* of the first Heaven.\nAncients likened it to true lead,\nTo golden flowers,\nTo white snow,\nTo the initial bowstring *qi* of the White Tiger—\nAll metaphors,\nYet ultimately referring to the union of Heaven and Earth,\nWhere Heaven loses a *yang* and falls into the Earth’s domain,\nAnd Earth, obtaining this Heavenly *yang*’s golden nature,\nBecomes solid and forms the *kan* (water).\nThus it is called \"golden\"—\nFor it descends from the Heavenly Trigram,\nAnd in the body is called *yang* essence.\n\nThough this essence dwells in the water palace,\nIt is the primordial *qi* of the first Heaven,\nCapable of becoming the mother of elixir cultivation.\nThe adept, refining medicine at the furnace,\nMust force the *yang* lead from the water palace as the elixir’s mother.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"All the body’s blood is pure yin,\nThe body’s yang essence few recognize.\"*\nThis yang essence—\nNeither inside nor outside,\nNot entering the six sense-gates,\nNot among the six dusts—\nHidden in the form-mountain,\nSeen yet unseen,\nHeard yet unheard,\nYet ever generating and unceasing—\nIt is the true seed and great foundation of the body.\n\nIf the yin essence does not obtain this primordial

      "translated_text": "「Thus, the *qi* of this body—\nShared by all sentient beings of the same kind—\nIs refined in the alchemical furnace;\n\nThen the primordial *yang* *qi* of the first Heaven,\nAnd the profoundest *yin* essence,\nEmerge from the state of *void* extremity and tranquil stillness,\nFrom the hazy and boundless depths—\nThis is the **upper elixir mother**, also the **mother *qi****.\n\nWith *yang* fire, one compels it to ascend and surge,\nUntil it reaches the *nīhuán* (泥丸, \"mud pellet\"),\nWhere it mingles with the long-accumulated *yin* karma,\nDescending to the upper palate,\nTransforming into sweet dew—\nThis is the **yin essence**, also called the **child *qi****.\n\nFrom this point, it descends to the **heavy palace** (重楼),\nPouring into the **divine chamber** (神房),\nTo be ingested and swallowed,\nWarming the gentle divine fire,\nNurturing this primordial *yang* *qi* and profoundest *yin* essence—\nThis is what the **Supreme Sage** (太上) meant by:\n*\"Having obtained its mother, one knows its child;\nHaving known its child, one returns to guard its mother.\"*\n\nAt first, the mother *qi* descends to embrace the child,\nThen the child *qi* clings to the mother in abiding,\nAnd finally, child and mother unite in harmony,\nNourishing each other—\nAs *yin* and *yang* interact yet return to their original source,\nEven death cannot harm one.\n\nFrom this, one must firmly uphold the **Rule of the Middle** (规中),\nWhere a single spirit is contained within—\nEndeavor to keep inner thoughts from straying outward,\nAnd external thoughts from entering in,\nSilencing speech, sealing the six sense-gates,\nContinuously and subtly,\nWithout wavering or ceasing,\nNeither aiding nor neglecting,\nWhether diligent or not—\nSo throughout life, one attains the **Golden Immortal** (金仙) state.\n\nOtherwise, if one seeks external gain,\nOne has already lost the internal treasure.\n\nAs it is said:\n*\"The mouth opens, the divine *qi* scatters;\nThe mind is disordered, the fire’s power wanes.\"*\n\nThose who value the external over the internal—\nTheir vital essence is already spent,\nTheir life-root where is it?\n\nHence, they are doomed throughout life.\n\nIf one can seal the **mouth of the *yīn* vessel** (塞兑) and close the gates,\nPreserving essence and gathering *qi*,\nThe mother *qi* and child *qi* merge to form the elixir.\n\nThe ancients said:\nThe **Emperor of Primordial Beginning** (元始天王),\nHangs a single **millet pearl** (黍珠) in the void,\nSeemingly present yet not,\nSeemingly empty yet not empty—\nOnly those who silently perceive with a focused mind\nCan truly see it.\n\nNothing is smaller than this elixir,\nAnd those who can see it are the truly wise.\n\nWhen the *yang* *qi* emerges,\nThe entire body softens like silk—\nThis is the **ultimate gentleness**.\n\nIf one can guard this ultimate gentle *qi*,\nWithout mixing a single thought,\nWithout adding a single perception,\nOver time, it will naturally manifest as **vast and surging *qi***,\nPiercing the heavens and filling the sun.\n\nThus, *\"Guarding gentleness is called strength.\"*\n\nYet at the outset of practice,\nThe divine light descends to illuminate the **sea of *qi*** (气海),\nThen the fire steams and the water boils,\nThe **golden essence** (金精) radiates,\nLike tides, like fire,\nLike mist, like smoke—\nI must then **withdraw sight and return hearing** (收视返听),\nSafeguarding its brilliance,\nGuiding it back to the **earthly crucible** (土釜),\nRestoring it to my primordial *yang* *qi*—\nSmall gains extend life and ward off illness,\nGreat gains achieve immortality and sainthood—\nWhat harm can come to the body then?\n\nOtherwise, old age, sickness, and death,\nWill arrive in the blink of an eye—\nHow can one not grieve?\n\nAll this is self-made,\nNot predestined by Heaven.\n\nIf one does not love the Dao,\nDoes one not love one’s body?\n\nDo not bring ruin upon yourself,\nFor regret will come too late.\n\nThis is the **true and constant Dao** (真常之道),\nOnly the **perfected** (至人) can follow its constancy,\nWithout defying its Way.\n\nThus, day by day, month by month,\nOne reaches the **divine and boundless mystery** (神妙无方),\nWhere transformations are unfathomable.\n\nThe saying goes:\n*\"Steadfastness is the foundation for becoming a Sage;\nA vacant heart is the vessel for bearing the Dao.\"*\nCan one afford to neglect it?\n\nThese words speak of the **true *yang* primordial *qi***,\nWhich originates from the moment one receives *qi* and takes form—\nFor life arises from *qi*,\nAnd *qi* is not trifling.\n\nConsider before birth—\nDid one not possess this *qi*?\nAfter death—\nThis *qi* is not necessarily extinguished.\n\nThe **primordial *yang* *qi*** (先天一气),\nSuspended in the **Great Void** (太空),\nExists within things when there are things,\nReturns to the Great Void when there are none.\n\nAll phenomena within Heaven and Earth,\nFrom the most mundane to the grandest,\nHave birth and death to speak of—\nBut this *qi* is neither born nor extinguished,\nNeither defiled nor pure,\nNeither increased nor diminished,\nEmpty yet not empty,\nNot empty yet empty—\nThe most divine and most wondrous of all,\nHence the **initial *qi* of all ten thousand things** (天下万物生生不息之始气).\n\nIf a Daoist practitioner knows how to obtain this **initial *qi***,\nThen the **Way of Longevity** (长生之道) can be attained,\nAnd the **state of Immortal Sagehood** (神仙之位) can be verified.\n\nFor the Immortal Sage is not inherently wondrous—\nIt is merely the *yang* *qi* lingering upon the *yin* essence,\nRefined over time until the *yin* essence transforms into *yang* *qi*,\nAnd the *yang* *qi* returns to the *yang* spirit—\nAs it is said:\n*\"This body is not that of a common mortal,\nBut the Immortal Sage from the Great Luo Heaven.\"*\n\nIf one were to cultivate only one aspect,\nHow could one attain **perfection of both form and spirit** (形神俱妙),\nIn harmony with the Dao,\nReaching the **ultimate extremes of odd and even** (极奇极变),\nThe **Sage’s self-illuminating essence** (至圣自灵)?\n\nThus, when the fire reaches its proper stage,\nThe golden elixir manifests—\nNaturally, the mouth forgets speech,\nThe tongue forgets taste,\nThe nose forgets scent,\nThe eyes see nothing,\nThe ears hear nothing—\nAs it is said:\n*\"The elixir field holds treasure,\nNaturally, one forgets all external appearances.\"*\n\nThis is the principle:\nThe one who **lightens the external** (轻外) **heavens the internal** (重内),\nThe one who guards the internal **forgets the external** (忘外)—\nAn unchanging law.\n\nYet before attaining the elixir,\nOne must still seal the *yīn* vessel and close the gates,\nTo accumulate essence and gather *qi*—\nAnd know that seeing the **small elixir** (小丹) is wisdom,\nWhile guarding the **Great Harmony** (太和) brings natural strength.\n\nEntering *qi* with the spirit,\nStoring spirit within *qi*—\nSuddenly, a single **millet pearl** appears,\nIts light permeating the **Dharma Realm** (法界)—\nThis is the moment when the **golden elixir radiates** (金丹焕发),\nAnd the **Great Dao is about to manifest** (大道将发).\n\nAt first, one uses the spirit to descend and await the *qi*,\nThen the *qi* arises,\nAnd one again uses the spirit to compel it upward,\nDriving it back to its source—\nThus attaining the **elixir of longevity** (长生之丹),\nAnd what harm can come to the body then?\n\nThis is achieved through constant practice and unceasing effort.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: Walking the Great Dao**\n*\"Let me, with

      "translated_text": "The vast and boundless *qi*, the primordial unity of Heaven and Earth at its first opening—this is the **original *Zǔqì* of Pre-Heaven**. Just as Mencius, upon suddenly seeing a child fall into a well, had a surge of alarm, compassion, and distress—this is the **sudden knowing of true *liángzhī*** in my Dao.\n\nThe stirring of such true *liángzhī* is not difficult to recognize, yet to act upon it and sustain it forever is no simple matter. When it moves, the world before one’s eyes is clear—yet in the blink of an eye, one is drawn into transformation, desire arises, emotions stir, and unaware, it slips into the private knowledge of **Post-Heaven**. This is why it must be tempered and applied with caution—**its power is truly to be feared**.\n\nOnly when the **eye holds the wisdom-pearl** and the **chest wields the insight-sword** can one pierce through the demons of illusion and sever the threads of desire. From **plucking herbs** to **returning to the elixir**, all are the unfolding of true *liángzhī* into true *liángnéng*—a path smooth and unadorned, with no trace of the strange. This is why the **Great Dao is so effortlessly vast**.\n\nAlas, though the **Great Dao is plain and ordinary**, those who seek swift progress and immediate results often stray from the **Kāngzhuāng Path**, venturing into narrow, twisted side trails. They mistake their own deviation for attainment, yet never awaken in their lifetime—**how lamentable!**\n\nThe body is like the morning sun: it longs for adornment yet fears annihilation. Only by **quelling evil and preserving sincerity** can one first purify desire and fully manifest Heaven’s principle. How could the **spiritual radiance** ever be allowed to fade? How could the **vital essence** ever be depleted? Without embroidered beauty, yet naturally resplendent; without oil and grain, yet fully sated—**why cling to external ornamentation or indulge in feasts?**\n\nThe **insight-sword** is keen—**no need for borrowed blades**. When the **Three Treasures** are perfected, **internal wealth** is inexhaustible—**no need for external riches**. Those who grasp this truly **steal the Heavenly *Língyáng* *qi*** to forge the elixir.\n\nYet today’s practitioners, abandoning **the Doctrine of the Mean**, rush toward **crooked paths**. Their bodies are thick with dust and filth—**how can they ever be cleansed?** Moreover, they recklessly provoke misfortune, losing their **Original *Yuányáng*** *qi*. Thus, they flit about in vain, never attaining the **empty void’s divine spirit**. When desolation reaches its peak, **the orifices are not entirely sealed**—**how can their vitality ever be restored?** When strength is exhausted and spirit drained, **there is no sign of repletion**. **Poverty is indeed to be lamented**—**how could their essence ever be whole?**\n\nThey boast of **external brilliance**, yet their adornments are mere pretense; they wield **blades of sharpness**, yet prize only the **waistband’s display**. **This is truly the end!**\n\nWhy do they not instead **learn how practitioners cleverly use the mechanisms** to **steal back the Original *qi***? The *I Ching* says: *“He who composes the *Yì* knows well how to steal.”*—just this is meant.\n\nTo abandon this and seek elsewhere is already **fragmented and extreme**—**how dare one claim it as the Great Dao?** The commentary below states that the phrase *“suddenly knowing”* is but a fleeting glimpse of clarity—**how could it ever be called true knowing?** Yet when tested in actual practice, one often falters in execution—hence the warning.\n\nThis reveals the **difficulty of the Great Dao**. The next section speaks of scholars who do not delve into the **root source** but only pride themselves on **external refinement**; who do not seek **true attainment** but only chase **empty fame**—just as one stands a staff and sees only its shadow, mistaking semblance for reality. **This is truly the thief of the staff.**\n\nThe lesson holds true. From ancient times, all who had the Dao—**their skin smooth and luminous, their hair crisp and bright**—these effects were shared by common folk, yet still not proof enough. **What of refining essence and *qi*?** When the **Yang Light** touches, **Yīnmái** cannot endure—just as frost and snow melt in the sun. Thus, even **aged illnesses** dissolve into **ulcers and pus**, expelled through the **large and small intestines**, not only for beginners but even at the stage of **Great Elixir Return**—**there are always transformations**.\n\nThe **Three Corpses and Six Bandits**, bleeding and oozing pus, their stench unbearable—**only those whose hearts are settled and whose faith in the principles is unshaken, who have truly penetrated the scriptures, can avoid this**.\n\nOne must know that **restraining desire and preserving sincerity**, **removing turbidity and retaining purity**—each layer involves the **dissipation of Yin *qi*** and the **subtle growth of Yang**. Practitioners of the Dao cannot ignore these **external manifestations**.\n\nDo not fixate on **bodily glory** or **swift movement**—**these cannot be relied upon as proof**. Even **soaring through clouds, vanishing into ghosts**, **a thousand transformations in a moment, ten thousand miles in an instant**—**these cannot be trusted as the Dao**. For **strange and marvelous phenomena**, **heterodox and perverse teachings** will inevitably **lead one astray**, producing **monstrous deviations**. **Pity that a lifetime’s vitality is wasted on crooked paths!** To **aspire to transcendence** yet fall into **the Three Paths and Six Realms**—**is this not deeply regrettable?**\n\nThe essence of this chapter by the **Supreme Sage** teaches that **only by recognizing true *liángzhī* can one avoid error**. Yet today’s Dao practitioners seek only **smooth skin and strong bodies**—**they do not realize that external labor exhausts the mind, while the Original Fields lie fallow and the Treasure Granaries empty**. Many have already **damaged their Pre-Heaven essence**.\n\nThough **Post-Heaven** may be intact, **what good is it?** Truly, when the **Three Treasures** gather, **external form naturally radiates**. Yet those who **dash outward** while **boasting of food and clothing**—**why not instead seek within, enriching the inner wealth first?** When **internal riches are full**, **external wealth comes naturally**. **Is this not unlike thieves**—**who steal not the Heavenly *Língyáng* *qi* but only the name of the Sage’s refinement?**\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: Cultivating the Body**\n*\"The well-built stands firm, the well-embraced does not slip—*\n*their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\"*\n\n**Cultivating the body**, its **virtue is complete**;\n**Cultivating the family**, its **virtue overflows**;\n**Cultivating the village**, its **virtue grows long**;\n**Cultivating the state**, its **virtue becomes abundant**.",

How could it be said that **a child begets a grandson, who begets a child again**, **generation upon generation**, **roots deep and leaves flourishing**, **source distant yet flow unending**, **illuminating the ancestral rites across ten thousand ages without cessation**?\n\nYet it is no more than **using primordial *qi* as medicine** and **primordial spirit as the alchemical fire**. **Primordial *qi* is no-*qi*** (*wúqì*), **primordial spirit is no-spirit** (*bùshén*). **Refining *qi* with spirit yields the Dao**, just as **fusing fire with medicine yields the elixir**. **Common elixirs may succeed or fail**, but **true elixir knows no end nor beginning**—thus it is said: *“The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir endures ten thousand years without erosion.”*\n\nIt is nothing but **cultivating one’s own virtue** and **refining one’s own body**—**not derived from later influences**, **not borrowed from without**—**thus its virtue is true**.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth give birth to man, **pure or impure, wise or foolish**, yet **when the august and sacred descend**, from the family to the realm, **each possesses an inherent constancy**. Thus, **a single heart can permeate ten thousand households**, **a single virtue can inspire ten thousand people**.\n\n**Cultivating the self to harmonize the family**—**virtue overflows**; **cultivating the self to transform the village**—**virtue endures**. As for **governing the state and pacifying the world**, it is nothing but **the sage’s robe swaying while the world transforms**—**there is no external cultivation of the self that can universally attain such influence**. This is the **constant Dao of the age**.\n\nConversely, **if one cultivates the self**, how could it differ?\n\nDiscussing the state and the world, it is **a matter of progressing from near to far**, **layer by layer**—**not a step-by-step retreat**. From the initial practice: **refining essence**, yet **qi and spirit are present**. The second step: **refining qi**, yet **spirit and essence remain**. The third step: **refining spirit**, yet **essence and qi are still within**. **Returning to the void and merging with the Dao**, **the Dao merging with nature**—**from beginning to end, it never departs**; **to depart is to lose the Dao**.\n\nThe **body is like essence**, but **essence is not the essence of mutual resonance**—it is the **initial essence received from the Great Void’s Five Phases**, the **inherited primordial essence that forms the body**. **Cultivating the body is refining essence into qi**. The practitioner, at first, **holds this essence to live and grow**. **Refining essence to cultivate the body is no different from cultivating the body itself**—how true is this!\n\nSpeaking of **qi**, essence is **closer to the body**, while **qi is slightly more distant**. *“Cultivating the family, its virtue overflows”*—**gathering external true yang-qi** to **refine internal true yin-essence** is like **using the body to harmonize the family**; **what abundance does one gain from oneself?**\n\nThe village, when viewed from the body, is **farther still**, yet **closer than the family**. It is like **spirit**, yet **spirit is fire**. **Heat belongs to qi**, **light belongs to spirit**—**two yet one**. **Cultivating the village is refining spirit back to the void**. Thus it is said: *“Its virtue endures”*, for **long life is boundless and eternal**.\n\nAs for the **state**, compared to the village it is **nearer**, yet **farther than the body**, its breadth **not visible in a single glance**. The **state is like the void**—**cultivating the state is refining the void to merge with the Dao**. **Refining until the void**, **becoming one with the clear and empty**, **illuminating the great thousandfold world**—what of the world itself? Thus it is said: *“Its virtue is universal.”*\n\nWhether observing **the body from the body**, **the family from the family**, **the village from the village**, **the state from the state**, or **the world from the world**—it is nothing but **using one’s own self and family as the model for the world’s self and family**, **taking the highest sage as analogy**—**its intent is intimate**, **its meaning profound**. The **Great Dao has no other path**: **refining essence to its utmost**, until it reaches **the void of natural spontaneity**. **Exhausted!**\n\nThe **learner of the Great Dao** has no other way: **only diminishing again and again**, until it reaches **the spontaneity of non-action**. **Non-action yet nothing remains undone**—**exhausted!**\n\nYet **internal elixirs and external elixirs**, **internal alchemy and external alchemy**, **drawing from the *Kàn* to fill the *Lí***, **extracting lead to add mercury**—**all these metaphors and names** ultimately refer to **the essence, *qi*, and spirit received from Heaven and Earth within the body**—**inherently possessed since birth**, yet **entrapped within the fleshly shell**, thus called *“yin-essence, yin-qi, yin-spirit”*; **since it comes with life itself**, it is called *“internal medicine.”*\n\nWhen the practitioner begins his work, he **must first close the senses and seal the orifices**, **concentrating within**, **regulating his breath**, **merging the Three Primordials into one cauldron**—**one cauldron refining the Three Primordials**—**named “refining essence”**, yet in truth **spirit and *qi* all return to one orifice**. Only when **spirit is harmonized and *qi* flows freely**, **united as one**, does the **vital mechanism activate**, **steaming and rising**—this is called **qi-transformation**, or **gold born from water’s depths**, or **the union of parents yielding the medicine**.\n\nThis is the **human way of procreation**; if one does not know the **method of inverse cultivation**, the moment **it transforms into postnatal, tangible essence**, it **leaks through the kidney passage**.

Thus, **water-fire *qi*** are **Kan and Li**, not **heart and kidneys** being **Kan and Li**—this is now clear.\n\nAgain, **Kan’s *qi* is called earthly soul**—in **external elixir**, it is the **White Tiger**; in **internal elixir**, it is the **golden elixir**.

omens of death.\nThus, when things grow strong, they grow old,\nNot as when they are young, they live.\nLife preserves its Dao,\nDeath abandons its Dao.\nHence it is said: *\"Things that age are against the Dao,\nAnd against the Dao, it is better to have never been.\"*\n\nLet those who cultivate the Dao\nEarly abandon the *qi* of aging,\nAnd seek the *qi* of the infant.\nIf one truly attains the state of the infant—\nFearless, without terror,\nWithout knowledge, without thought,\nA boundless undifferentiated whole,\nFlowing beyond all forms—\nThis is harmony.\n\nFor the Dao of Heaven nurtures all things through harmony.\nIf one knows this,\nThen vitality flows without ceasing—\nThus it is called *constant*.\nTo know the constant is to penetrate yin and yang,\nTo align with creation—\nThus it is called *enlightenment*.\nTo cultivate the self and establish one’s fate,\nTo seize the power of Heaven and Earth’s life and death—\nNo blessing surpasses this among mortals.\n\nRefining the spirit and returning to the void,\nAttaining the Dao of unending life—\nHow could this not be the ultimate strength?\nWhat is there that is not the Dao?\n\nThis is the method of cultivating the self,\nTaking the infant as its symbol.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The infant moves without knowing where,\nWalks without knowing where it goes,\nIts body like withered wood,\nIts heart like dead ashes—\nDisaster does not come,\nFortune does not arrive.\"*\n\nIf disaster and fortune are nonexistent,\nHow could there be human calamities or harm from things?\n\nThe lines on *\"poisonous creatures\"* express this very meaning.\n\nLater, when gathering herbs or refining elixirs,\nOne must take the pristine, tender water of the first hour—\nThis water is the source of all life.\nLike a wheel of red sun at midnight,\nClear and bright, illuminating the vast sea;\nOr like a crescent moon in autumn,\nEmerging in the *Geng* and *Zhen* directions—\nThis is when the adept’s mystical pass opens,\nVague and distant, yet this realm is attained.\n\nFor when the initial *qi* is cultivated in softness,\nIt is like all things bending their branches and sprouting leaves.\nNurture and nourish it thus,\nAnd it will grow daily and monthly,\nUntil returning to the root of life,\nAnd bearing the fruit of fulfillment.\n\nBut in the declining years of twilight,\nThings have aged and are withering,\nUnfit to be gathered as medicine.\nYet aging is not measured by years—\nIt refers to the *qi* of the herb growing old and unfit for elixir.\n\nIf measured by years,\nEven at eighty or ninety,\nOne may still cultivate the Dao of eternal youth.\nFor as long as breath remains,\nThis very *qi* of primal harmony suffuses the body,\nWithout the slightest deficiency.",

true teacher will never be drawn to manifest,\nand the *White Tiger Canon* will remain unfound.\nEven if youth enters the Dao,\nthey will surely grow old without attainment.\n\nMany have erred by following false teachers,\nwandering down false paths,\nand wasted their lifetimes’ essence in the realm of beasts.\nLet the student beware!\n\n**Chapter 56: The Most Noble for All Under

called *Mystic Unity*.\n\nThus, one cannot be too close nor too distant,\ntoo beneficial nor too harmful,\ntoo noble nor too lowly.\nTherefore, they are the most noble for all under heaven.\n\nGenerally, those without virtue,\nwhen they hear a good word or see a good deed,\nimmediately chatter grandly to stir others,\nthus pleasing the moment without ever\ntransforming their face or purifying their heart,\nor reflecting inwardly to verify the truth.\n\nConfucius said, *\"Hearsay and gossip are the abandonment of virtue,\"*\nand this is indeed not false.\n\nBut the true knower of the Great Dao,\nwhen they occasionally grasp something,\nis occupied morning and evening with solemn vigilance—\nhow could they have the leisure to speak for others’ ears?\nEven if they ponder the old to know the new,\nand suddenly grasp the meaning,\nthey possess it themselves and find it in themselves—\nlike one sated with food and drink,\ndrunk and full,\nknowing the taste for themselves alone,\nyet unable to convey it to others.\n\nThose who love to speak of such things\nmust surely lack something within themselves.\n\nMoreover, virtue is for oneself, cultivation is for oneself—\nonce truly known, it must be guarded all the more.\nFear that a single careless word\nmight cause even a breath to stray,\nand the Way lost from the heart.\nThis is why the wise do not speak.\n\nIf they speak, it is because they lack virtue within themselves,\ntruly knowing nothing of the Dao.\nIf they truly knew, why would they so lightly reveal it?\nThus, those who speak do not understand—\nthis is even more evident.\n\nBesides, the essence is what cannot be spoken of,\nand what can be spoken of is but dross.\nThe wise do not fail to speak because they cannot,\nbut because it is difficult to speak.\nThose who speak do not fail to know,\nbut only see the surface.\n\nAs the saying goes, *\"When you’ve grasped it, close your mouth.\"*\nIndeed, knowing the Dao is not easy—\nhow could one waste their *qi* with words,\nor taint their spirit with idle chatter,\nboasting of talents and abilities to stand out,\nonly to invite the disdain of the vulgar?\n\nThus, the

dust,\nbowing and rising with the times,\nfloating and sinking with the world,\nas if foolish, as if drunk,\nas if slow of speech, as if mad—\nwhen the multitude is confused, they too are confused,\nneither flaunting their oddities nor setting themselves apart,\ncontradicting neither themselves nor the world.\n\nShould even a trace of pretense or ambition arise,\nthey cannot help but

whip and beat.\nThose who can be honored with rank and wealth,\nI will pierce and insult.\"*\n\nOnly by secluding oneself to cultivate in secret,\nembracing the primal and guarding the One,\nremaining silent and still,\n*qi* dim and mysterious,\ntranquil and without desire,\nacting without action, doing without doing—\nthen one cannot be too close nor too distant,\ntoo beneficial nor too harmful,\ntoo noble nor too lowly.\n\nThis is to seek within oneself, not without,\nnot seeking from others,\nfulfilling one’s nature and returning to one’s life—\nthus, they are the most noble for all under heaven.\n\nWithin the Three Realms, only the Dao is supreme.\nI cultivate my Dao, and thus my Dao is noble—\nnothing under heaven surpasses this.\n\nThe *Taishang* said: *\"Few know me, thus I am noble.\"*\nDo the students know this as well?\n\nThe person of the Way must not speak lightly,\nfor few in the world understand the Dao.\nIf one indulges in idle talk,\nnot only does it harm oneself internally,\nbut it also invites external scorn from others.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says: *\"If secrets are not kept, harm will follow.\"*\nThroughout history, many cultivators\nhave invited disaster by carelessly revealing secrets.\n\nThus, the virtuous are cautious and do not speak lightly.\nEven if one speaks to the worthy,\nthey proceed with utmost caution and deliberation,\ntesting again and again,\nbefore solemnly vowing to heaven and earth,\nascending the platform to teach—\nyet they dare not speak too high or too far,\nlest they prattle

ceasing,\ncalming with stillness, steadying with composure,\navoiding frivolous actions that would embolden disorder,\nand maintaining rectitude so that all things fall into order naturally,\nlike

cycle that repeats without fail,\nfrom ancient times to this day.\n\nThough in times of order, ritual and music prevail,\nand in times of chaos, arms and warfare dominate,\nwhen two armies face each other in battle,\nwhen great enemies clash,\nthe fate of the state and the lives of the people\nrest upon a single general—\nhow could this not be of utmost weight?\n\nThough the arts of strategy and calculation,\nthe cleverness of schemes and tactics,\nare not the pursuits of the virtuous,\nyet to uphold Heaven’s mandate in punishing rebels\nand to wield great righteousness in relieving the people\nis not to shun extraordinary means to victory.\n\nThus, military strategy includes:\nambushes and covert raids,\nexploiting fatigue and exhaustion,\ndividing and sowing discord,\nfeigning weakness to deceive,\nmoving like ghosts and spirits in the unseen.\nUsing the strange in warfare,\none is undefeated in battle,\nunconquered in assault,\nspilling no blood,\ndraining no wealth,\nwhile the people live long in a land of order,\nenjoying eternal peace—\nhow could this not be the Way of Non-Action?\n\nYet to unite mountains and rivers under one rule,\nto merge heaven and earth under one sovereignty—\nhow could there be no affairs at all?\nBut if one lets all things unfold naturally\nwhile maintaining an unshaken, composed heart,\nthen naturally one harmonizes with Heaven,\nand Heaven’s favor descends;\none is revered by the people,\nand all under heaven willingly submits.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The sages of Tang and Yu governed with a cup of wine,\nwhile Tang and Wu conquered with a single move on the board.\"*\n\nOnly when one does not covet the world\ncan one take the world without effort—\nthus the mind remains undisturbed,\nand one’s capacity matches that of Heaven and Earth.\nTherefore, ruling China and pacifying the barbarians\ncomes effortlessly, as if by fate.\n\nSuch is the Dao of governing the world.\nHow do I know this to be true?\nBecause the Dao of governing the world\nis none other than the Dao of governing oneself—\nthe body is like a state.\nWhat one sees, hears, speaks, and does\nmust conform to ritual;\none’s thoughts and deliberations\nmust align with humaneness.\nNeither internal distractions nor external intrusions\nshould disrupt the settled nature—\nonce the mind is steadied, the body follows suit.\nWhen stillness is cultivated over time,\nHeaven’s natural impulses move on their own.\n\nTo use the ordinary method of nurturing life\nas the alchemical method of reversal,\napproaching the furnace with fire—\nthis is fraught with danger.\nThe Sage likens it to warfare:\none must act according to the times,\nseize opportunities as they arise,\nharvest at the right moment,\nrefine with precision,\nchoose the right terrain for battle,\nand defend with strategy.\nOne must wait for the opportune moment,\nseize the advantage,\nand strike with extraordinary tactics.\n\nAs for stopping the fire when the medicine is sufficient,\nwarming the furnace when the elixir is ripe,\nascending the sun’s essence to the void,\nnurturing the immortal embryo in its unbroken state—\none must still cultivate the divine chamber in stillness,\nremaining utterly detached from all affairs,\nonly then can the elixir be perfected,\nand immortality achieved.\nThis is the Dao of governing oneself—\na metaphor for the achievement of governing the world.\nThus, I know the Dao of governing the world\nthrough the method of governing oneself.\n\nTo take the world requires Non-Action,\nyet to hold the world requires avoiding excess.\nOtherwise, with endless edicts and prohibitions,\nsuspended laws and decrees,\nthe people will grow weary of compliance,\nand corruption will inevitably follow,\nneglecting their duties.\nThus, when laws multiply, the people grow poorer.\n\nGold, jade, pearls, and jewels,\ncarriages, horses, fine clothes—\nthough these are the people’s tools of utility,\nonce greed arises, desire is insatiable,\nand the mind grows clouded,\nthe qi grows turbid.\nSimplicity and sincerity fade,\nwhile deceit and cunning prevail.\nWhen a clever artisan emerges,\npeople admire and emulate them,\nand soon strange and bizarre things fill the courts.\nAlas!\n\nIn the flourishing ages of the Three Dynasties,\nthe rulers were divine and sagely,\nthe people pure and virtuous.\nLaws were enacted but not enforced,\ninstitutions established but not applied—\nthus they were called ages of prosperity.\n\nNow, however, legal nets are vast and dense,\nlike a fine mesh;\nfive-tiered punishments loom heavy,\nwith no mercy for transgressors;\nthree-chapter codes stand severe,\nwith no pardon for offenders.\nYet why, when laws grow stricter,\ndo crimes multiply?\nWhy, when decrees proliferate,\ndo thieves increase?\nIt is because virtue is insufficient to win the people’s hearts,\nand thus laws cannot instill fear in their resolve.\n\nFrom ancient times, those who drove the people to rebellion\nwere never those who lacked such coercive measures.\nThis is evident since the Qin and Han dynasties.\n\nThe ancient Sage said:\n*\"Heaven rules through Non-Action and is thereby honored;\nman rules through Non-Action and is thereby burdened.\"*\nIf I govern with reverence and simplicity,\nnot overwhelming the people with excess,\nnot confusing the state with constant

flow naturally.\n\nFor those whose practice is pure and refined,\none need not consciously hold onto it—\nbut if this stage has not yet been reached,\nthe mind of awareness must never be forgotten.\n\nIf forgotten, one risks drifting into habitual tendencies,\nunaware of the ceaseless arising and passing of thoughts—\nendless cycles of birth and death—\nuntil the original, untainted essence\nis swallowed by the very mind of generation and annihilation.\n\nThe ancient Buddhas taught:\n*\"Know the source of arising,\nand you know the source of ceasing.\"*\n\nThus, one must nurture this awareness,\nuntil over time the origins of arising and ceasing are seen,\nand then, over time again, the state before any thought arises is glimpsed—\nonly then is it attained.\n\nAs for the teachings of the Yellow Court [黃庭],\nthey speak of neither presence nor absence,\nneither inner nor outer;\nyet they are also within the body of form,\nyet not entirely within it.\n\nWhere lies this subtle secret?\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Concentrate the mind in emptiness,\nand merge the qi in the boundless.\"*\n\nTo concentrate the mind in emptiness,\nand merge the qi in the boundless,\nis like dwelling in the elixir field [丹田],\nyet not fixating the gaze inward to observe,\nnor forcing the mind and qi to cling within.\n\nOnly by focusing the mind at the navel’s lower region,\nnot far from the flesh and skin,\ndoes one achieve the \"neither inner nor outer\" state.\n\nDirecting intention there,\none feels the breath at mouth and nostrils cease,\nwhile the elixir field’s qi\nrolls and swells in the space where inner and outer meet,\nknotted into a singular whole—\ntruly *gǒu yún* [絪絪缊缊],\nundifferentiated and pure,\neffortlessly rising and falling,\nin perfect accord with Heaven’s primordial qi,\nuninterrupted and seamless.\n\nHere, essence, qi, and spirit are born,\nclose to the divine—\nthis is the \"merging qi in the boundless\" teaching.\n\nThe ancients called it *\"primal qi\"* [元气],\n*\"embryonic breath\"* [胎息],\nor *\"the True Person’s breath reaching the heels\"* [真人之息以踵].\nWhat else could it be?\n\nThe *\"primal qi\"* is that undefiled breath\nwithin the boundless, formless void—\na single, pure exhalation, clear and empty.\n\nThe *\"embryonic breath\"* is this:\nwhen one first receives qi in the womb,\nthe body is nourished there,\nmouth and nostrils yet unopened—\nhow then does it take in breath to live?\n\nOnly this navel-field qi,\ncommuning with the mother’s navel-wheel [脐轮],\nis why the child grows daily.\n\nWhen the cry of birth pierces the earth,\nand life begins outside the womb,\nthis qi flows in and out through the mouth and nostrils—\nthis is the *\"each establishes their own heaven and earth\"* [各立乾坤] principle.\n\nI show that the navel-wheel’s qi\nmeets the external Heavenly breath,\nneither fully inner nor outer,\n*gǒu yún* [絪缊] and mingled—\na seamless fusion—\nwhich is to return to the moment of first receiving qi,\nand reconnect with the mother’s breath—\nthis is the embryonic breath.\n\nThe *\"True Person’s breath reaching the heels\"* means:\nthe True Person’s breath is stored deeply,\nspreads subtly,\ninvisible, inaudible, untouchable—\ndeep and profound,\nlike qi extending to the soles of the feet.\n\nThe breath of mouth and nostrils is not useless,\nbut it must be allowed to act naturally;\none cannot rely solely on it for inhalation and exhalation.\nIf one uses only this breath\nwithout first focusing the mind\nat the navel’s lower region—\none inch and three *fēn* [分] below the flesh—\nand seeking this void within the void,\nto draw Heavenly qi into the infinite,\nthe result will be a mingling of purity and turbidity,\nmaking alchemical refinement impossible.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Heaven generates people with the One Primal Qi [一元真气],\nwhich is neither mouth nor nostrils,\nnor the subtle, sentient soul [灵] of knowing and moving.\"*\n\nThey also said:\n*\"The Mysterious Feminine Gate [玄牝之门] few know,\nDo not waste breath through mouth and nostrils.\nThough you practice inhalation and exhalation for a thousand ages,\nHow could you ever grasp the Golden Rooster seizing the Rabbit?\"*\n[金乌搦兔儿]\n\nFrom these few lines alone,\nit is clear that *\"emerging from the Mysterious,\nentering the Feminine\"* [出玄入牝]\nrefers to the space\none inch and three *fēn* [分] below the navel,\nwhere the qi *yīn yīn yūn yūn* [氤氤氲氲],\ncondenses into a single mass.\n\nThose who study the Dao,\nwhether at meal times or in idle conversation,\nmust subtly direct a little intention,\nfocusing the mind in the void’s single orifice—\nnaturally merging qi in the boundless,\nand seeing the True Qi move,\nin ineffable wonder.\n\nYet in this breath regulation,\none knows the mind does not enter within,\nand the Water of the Abyss [坎水] naturally clarifies.\n\nThis is the unspoken secret of generations of immortals and sages.\nI now reveal it plainly—\nlater scholars must not dismiss it as empty words.\n\n**Chapter 58: Calamity, Fortune’s Shadow**\nIts governance is muted and unassuming,\nits people pure and refined.\n\nIts governance is sharp and scrutinizing,\nits people restless and deficient.\n\nCalamity, fortune’s leaning post;\nFortune, calamity’s hidden root.\nWho knows their ultimate measure?\nWhen the upright becomes the strange,\nwhen the good becomes the demonic.\n\nThe people’s delusion has endured long.\n\nThus, the sage\nis square without cutting,\nhonest without rigidity,\nstraight without excess,\nbright without blinding.\n\nHeaven and Earth transform without intent,\nthe sovereign rules without action.\nThis Way of Non-Action\nis the great principle and law\nby which the sage opened Heaven and Earth,\nunified the world and ordered all

writings gleam and their deeds shine,\nthey cannot achieve the harmonious, luminous state\nwhere all rejoice in the flourishing and abundant transformation.\n\nThus, the *Tàishàng* [太上] says:\n*\"Governance is the rectification of the self\"* [政者正也],\nto correct others’ deviations with one’s own rectitude.\n\nSince ancient times,\nthose who govern the people\nhave established human norms,\nregulated Heaven’s order—\nwhether knowing or seeming ignorant,\nwhether acting or seeming inaction,\nall let Heaven’s spontaneity move freely.\n\nAt first, there is no arbitrary

      "translated_text": "To establish oneself is to establish others; to reach oneself is to reach others.\nWithout waiting for a change of thought, without needing to delay time—how easy and simple it is!\n\nThus, the **Supreme Sage** said: *\"To govern a great realm is like cooking fresh delicacies.\"*\n\nWhen a realm is great, its affairs must be numerous, its people many. If one does not grasp the **Dao**, then matters will inevitably become chaotic and convoluted—like trying to untangle disordered silk, the more one tries to govern, the more tangled it becomes.\n\nOnly by refining oneself with the **Dao** shared by all—governing the multitude with this same principle—do the **principles** align, the **qi** flow uninterrupted, and the governance become effortlessly effective.\n\nOtherwise, relying solely on laws, decrees, stratagems, and technical measures to command the world—when openly enforced, it breeds resentment among the people, and their hearts grow deceitful and multifarious; when secretly imposed, it provokes the wrath of the **spirits**, and calamities and disasters multiply.\n\nFor humans are the sovereigns of **ghosts and spirits**. When rulers impose heavy taxes and cruel tyranny, leaving the people with no refuge, then **ghosts and spirits**, lacking any attachment, must stir up omens and portents—famine, pestilence, and misfortune follow inevitably.\n\nThus, the **stone spirit** appeared in **Jin**, the **comet** in **Qi**, the **serpents fought** in **Zheng**, **Bo You** became a vengeful ghost, **Shen Sheng** was haunted by spirits, the **Two Rascals** fell ill beyond cure, **Shen Xin** descended, and **Guo** was destroyed—though these were said to be the work of **ghosts and spirits**, they were truly the result of the ruler’s lack of the **Dao**.\n\nIf those who rule the people truly refine themselves with the **Dao** and transform the people with the **Dao**, then even the most **obscure and stubborn spirits** will naturally gravitate toward them—no grievances arise among the people, no disasters from the **ghosts**. Mountains and rivers remain unscathed, no strange phenomena appear, and all enjoy a flourishing peace.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\n*\"Our ancient kings diligently cultivated their virtue.\nThere were no celestial calamities—mountains, rivers, ghosts, and spirits were all at peace.\"*\n\nIs this not because the **spirits are not uncanny**?\nFor **demons and spirits**, mountain **precincts** and water **monsters**, all depend on some attachment, require their offerings, and follow their natural course without interference. Even if there are **spirits**, they have nothing to manifest; even if they manifest, how could they cause harm?\n\nThus, **yin** and **yang**, humans and **ghosts**, all play and frolic under the bright heavens—how could they harm anyone?\n\nIt is not that the **spirit does not harm**, but that the **Sage**, possessing the **Dao**, lacks the prying intelligence of the overly perceptive and the self-aggrandizing benevolence of the overly sentimental. They carefully refine themselves, uphold natural relationships, maintain reverence in action and simplicity in conduct, avoiding all unnecessary complexity—never causing the slightest harm to others.\n\nWhen **yin** and **yang** are harmonized, the people and all things flourish; when rituals are honored, **ghosts and spirits** are at ease. In the unseen realm, there is no mutual intrusion. Thus, all under heaven willingly submit to the **Sage’s virtue** and return to its accord.\n\nAh! The governance of **non-action** is drawn near from the self and far from all things. The unknowing and unknowing—this is the **Way of the Emperor**. Compared to those who rely on strict decrees and harsh punishments, hoping for diligence through fear—who is more difficult, who is more burdensome? The difference is as vast as heaven and earth!\n\nWhy do people not seek the fundamental principle?\n\nThis is the **great realm** illustrating the **great Dao**, just as **cooking fresh delicacies** illustrates **alchemical refinement**. Fresh delicacies—such as lamb, fish, and meat—are cooked only with soy sauce, vinegar, salt, and plum sauce, balancing the five flavors. Supporting what is deficient, restraining what is excessive, and gently nurturing with warm fire, the flavors emerge naturally over time, pleasing both body and palate.\n\nRefining the **Great Elixir** likewise requires harmonizing the four **symbols**, gathering the five **phases**, making the three **blossoms** converge in one **cauldron** and the five **qi** gather in the central **field**. Then, the natural divine fire slowly nurtures—no need for artificial adjustment, no forced manipulation. It proceeds naturally, and in seven returns and nine revolutions, it is as easy as turning one’s palm.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Slowly tend the alchemical furnace, watching the fire’s nature,\nOnly rest the spirit and let heaven’s work unfold naturally.\"*\n\nHow effortless it is!\n\nThus, the **Dao of non-action** is the **Dao of ruling the world**, and it is also the **elixir of Great Return** for refining oneself.\n\nIn a **Great Peace**, governance reaches its highest principle—regulations are light, the people transform naturally. Above, there is **non-action**, yet all is governed; below, there is **non-action**, yet all is transformed. All **ghostly omens and malevolent spirits** vanish without a trace—not that they are annihilated, but that they naturally dissolve into the **Dao of non-action**, their deceits and transformations having no place to manifest. Droughts, floods, plagues, and epidemics cannot arise.\n\nIn the human body, **ghosts** are the **yin**, still and unaware; **spirits** are the **yang**, dynamic and active. For those who cultivate greatly, the mind encompasses all things yet remains without mind, emotions respond to all things yet remain without emotion. **Yin** contains **yang**, **yang** contains **yin**—stillness without stillness, motion without motion. Motion and stillness interact; **yin** and **yang** mutually root each other.\n\nIt is not that there is no awareness in unawareness or action in non-action. Rather, within unawareness lies awareness; within non-action lies action.\n\nWhen it is said, *\"its spirits are not uncanny,\"* it is not that they are dull and lifeless. For the awareness within unawareness is the **true and equal awakening**; non-action in action is the natural unfolding of heaven’s will. How could it compare to the deceptive awareness of the overly conscious or the rigid adherence of the overly active, which would harm the **original elixir**?\n\nWhen it is said, *\"its spirit does not harm,\"* it is not that the **spirit does not harm**, but that the **Dao of non-action** preserves the innate **true nature** of life and the ceaseless **numinous qi** of existence—uninterrupted sincerity, encompassing all things without omission. Though there may be creation and destruction, there is no true loss or gain; though there may be fullness and emptiness, there is no true increase or decrease.",

It is not that the sage does not harm others, but rather that with the **vital force** of spontaneous vitality, he preserves the **original true nature**; with the **harmonizing trance** of the Three Mysteries, he nurtures the **free-flowing elixir**. At once, the **divine fire** refines, and the ghosts wail while the spirits cry out, the malevolent retreat in submission—**the True Person** emerges.\n\nThis is called *\"the two not harming each other,\"* who could say otherwise? Both in heaven and among men, all praise its **virtue**.\n\nAh! The interplay of darkness and light—**not the virtue of the spirit**, how could it reach such heights?\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One: The Great Must Descend**\n\nThe great state descends to flow beneath,\na gathering place for all under heaven,\nthe **receptive** of all under heaven.\n\nThe **receptive** always takes the **creative** through stillness,\nstillness as the foundation of descent.\nThus, when the great state descends beneath the small state,\nit takes the small state;\nwhen the small state descends beneath the great state,\nit takes the great state.\nHence, either it descends to take,\nor it descends while taking.\n\nThe great state seeks only to **harbor** all people,\nthe small state seeks only to **submit** and serve others.\nWhen both attain what they desire,\nthe great state is fitting to descend.\n\nThe **Supreme Sage** speaks of cultivating the Dao and refining the elixir—\nall must take **gentleness** as the principle,\nstillness as the essence.\n\nThough it may be said that *\"gentleness and passivity are useless,\"*\nand *\"solitude and seclusion are hard to accomplish,\"*\nyet at the outset of seated meditation,\none must first arise from stillness,\nrigidity from gentleness—\nonly then is the **true and equal Dao** revealed.\n\nThe analogy: *\"The great state descends to flow beneath,\"*\nspeaks of water having high and low—\nthe high water must flow downward before it ceases.\n\nIf the great state humbles itself and restrains its ambition,\nwith no thought of arrogance or deception,\nit will be admired by all under heaven—\nlike the low-lying land where all streams converge,\nits influence is inevitable.\n\nThus it is said: *\"The gathering place of all under heaven.\"*\n\nWhen all under heaven gather,\nit is because they can descend themselves.\nDescending, their **qi** is most **gentle**—\nnot the utmost **rigidity**.\n\nWhich among things is more **creative** than the **creative**?\nWhich is more **receptive** than the **receptive**?\n\nThe **creative** is yang, **rigidity**;\nthe **receptive** is yin, **gentleness**.\nThus, it is fitting that the **creative yang** should surpass the **receptive yin**—\nyet why does the **receptive** always overcome the **creative**?\n\nIt is because the **receptive** can attain stillness.\nThe ancients said: *\"Stillness governs movement,\"*\ntheir words are unerring—\njust as the low supports the high,\nits influence is inevitable.\n\nHow much more so for the great state,\nwhich descends to **nurture** itself,\nis **humble** to **protect** others,\nand yet all states come to **revere** and **submit**?\n\nThus, descending is the basis of **high** virtue,\nstillness the root of descent.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nsometimes the great state descends beneath the small state—\nlike **Tang the Victorious** descending to **Bo Ge**,\nultimately taking **Bo Ge’s** lands,\n**nurturing** and **possessing** them—\nthis is the case.\n\nOr the small state descends beneath the great state—\nlike **Gou Jian** submitting to the **King of Wu**,\nultimately taking **Wu’s** legacy,\n**harboring** and **possessing** it—\nthis is the case.\n\nOr the great state does not act great but acts small—\nthus it takes the small state as effortlessly as turning one’s palm.\n\nOr the small state remains content in its smallness and serves the great—\nthus it takes the great state as easily as picking up a blade of grass.\n\nDiscussing the **proud and mighty** great states,\nthey are truly the models for all states,\n**nurturing** and **calming** with method,\n**embracing** and **reconciling** with strategy—\nnot desiring to swallow all under heaven,\nto unify the land by force,\nbut rather to **harbor** the small states,\nto make all under heaven a single family—\nonly those with **great virtue** beyond others\ncan **rest** and **contain** with ease.\n\nThus, it is fitting that all under heaven should **return** to **Ren**,\nall directions **submit** to the **Mandate**.\n\nThe **petty and insignificant**,\nall equally part of the **feudal division**,\nas vassals offering tribute in fear and trembling—\nnot desiring to **exalt**

indistinct—\nvisible yet unseen, heard yet unheard, grasped yet untouched—\nyet truly that upon which all things depend for life.\n\nZisi said:\n*“The way of the noble is costly and hidden.”*\nWithout the Dao, there is no thing;\nwithout things, there is no Dao.\nThe Great Cycle’s boundaries,\nrefined into the finest dust—\nit cannot be sought through traces or symbols,\ncannot be exhausted by speech.\nTruly, it contains the utmost void yet embraces the utmost reality,\nthe utmost emptiness yet encompasses the utmost substance—\nvast and boundless, profound and unfathomable.\nNo mystery surpasses this.\n\nThe virtuous know this Dao is the most vital to the human body,\nso they cherish and conceal it,\ncultivate and treasure it,\nnever willing to part from it even for a breath.\nThe

Heaven’s mandate,\nand enjoy boundless blessings?\n\nEven with the splendor of arched walls before him,\nand fine carriages drawn by four steeds behind,\nhe cannot find a moment’s ease.\n\nHow much

goodness—\ngoodness alone is the treasure.\"*\n\nThe *Shang Book* says:\n*\"Treasure only the virtuous,\nand the common folk shall be at peace.\"*\n\nThis is the Dao—\nthe most prized by ancient emperors, kings, ministers, and officials alike.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?\nBecause the Dao is the inherent path of all people,\none who seeks it shall find it,\nand its pursuit is swift and effortless.\n\nIf one upholds this Dao,\nhe becomes a true man of worth;\nif one defies and betrays it,\nhe becomes a great offender against Heaven and Earth.\n\nIs it merely that he has faults\nand cannot avoid straying into error?\nZisi’s son said:\n*\"The Dao must never be abandoned for an instant.\"*\n\nLet men strive earnestly!\nFor the Dao is a great matter in

say, *\"I am too aged,\nmy qi too diminished,\"*\nand thus excuse oneself—\nthis is not acceptable.\n\nThough gold elixir and jade elixir\nmay require the refinement of post-heaven *qi*, essence, and spirit\nto attain immortality and sainthood,\nthey are not the core of our teaching.\n\nThe ancients spoke of *\"Great Harmony as the Dao,\"*\nand again of *\"Emptiness-Nothingness as the Dao.\"*\nThus, if one does not grasp the principle of Emptiness-Nothingness,\nor the Dao of Great Harmony,\neven if he refines essence and subdues *qi*,\nenters the realm of non-duality (*feifei*),\nstill he will differ not from the common man.\n\nTherefore, in our Daoist practice of elixir cultivation,\none must take the Primordial Spirit (*yuánshén*) as the master,\nand the Primordial *Qi* (*yuánqì*) as the assistant to the spirit,\nusing true breathing as the means to forge the elixir.\n\nWithout the Primordial Spirit,\nthere is no foundation for the elixir;\nwithout the Primordial *Qi*,\nthere is no aid to refine it.\n\nThis is like a fetus having a child within it—\nwithout the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood,\nit remains empty and unformed.\n\nOnce the Primordial Spirit and *Qi* are obtained,\nwithout true fetal breathing (*táixī*),\nthe spirit and *qi* cannot coalesce in one place,\nmerge as a single whole,\nand return to the original state of Great Purity (*táisù*).\n\nI impart this further truth:\nWhen a person practices cultivation,\nhaving obtained the Primordial Spirit and *Qi*,\nand possessing true breath to regulate,\nhe must gather the five into four,\nand merge the three into one.\nYet without true intention as the guiding commander,\nthe energies shall scatter and disperse,\nnever spontaneously uniting to form the elixir.\n\nBut whence does true intention arise?\nIt must come from the state of utmost Emptiness and profound stillness,\nwhen there is no knowing and no awareness—\nsuddenly, the *qi*-mechanism is touched,\nand awareness begins.\nThis is the true intention,\nnot the same as ordinary mind or ordinary intention.\n\nThus the ancients said,\n*\"Sainthood is not attained by others—\nonly by this one who cultivates without attachment.\"*\n\nYet without the gold within water,\nand the *qi* within essence,\nas aids to support it,\neven the Primordial nature remains suspended and ungrounded,\nand may fall into dull, inert voidness.\n\nOnce knowing the birth of the elixir,\nwithout true breath to regulate and refine,\nhow could one gather and cook it into the elixir?\n\nThus, true breath is the essential tool for elixir cultivation,\nand true intention is the sovereign ruler of true breath.\n\nFor those who have not yet attained unity of spirit and *qi*,\nhow can they achieve stillness and concentration?\n\nOnce spirit and *qi* are returned to their command,\nthey must be deeply fermented—\nonly then shall the elixir be fully realized.\n\nDo not dare to arouse the bright, aware mind,\nfor this shall only cause separation between wood and metal,\nand block the interaction of *kàn* and *lí* (water and fire).\n\nI use this to illuminate the mysteries of the Dao—\nlater scholars who grasp its meaning,\nlet them cherish and guard it carefully!\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three: The Great as the Non-Great**\nTo act in greatness is to act in non-action (*wúwéi*),\nto do in doing is to do in non-doing (*shìwúshì*),\nto taste in tastelessness is to taste the Dao.\n\nGreat and small, much and little—\nto repay resentment with virtue.\n\nTo attempt the difficult in its ease,\nto achieve the great in its minute.\n\nThe most difficult things under Heaven\nmust be begun in simplicity;\nthe greatest affairs under Heaven\nmust be rooted in the smallest details.\n\nTherefore, the Sage never acts in greatness,\nand thus can accomplish the great.\n\nHe who makes light of his promises\nshall be found lacking in trustworthiness;\nhe who seeks much shall encounter many difficulties.\n\nThus the Sage treats difficulty as difficulty,\nand so shall he never face true difficulty.\n\nThe Dao is inherently the Middle Way (*zhōngyōng*),\none that all may learn,\nand each may attain.\n\nYet because of the obstruction of things\nand the constriction of *qi*,\nif one does not forcefully cut away these hindrances,\nhow can he penetrate and see the original face of reality?\n\nLike washing clothes—\nlong stained by dust and filth,\none cannot remove it in a single step.\nIt must be gradually scrubbed,\ndelicately plucked,\nonly then can the ragged cloth be made whole and new.\n\nIf one uses too much force,\nnot only shall the filth not be removed,\nbut the garment itself may be torn.\n\nThus the practitioner who seeks to penetrate the fundamental truth,\nhow can he fail to proceed step by step?\n\nAt first, he must strive and discipline himself,\nwithout reckless haste;\nwith time, he grows natural in the Middle Way,\nand sees the original nature of Heaven.\n\nWhen his work reaches the stage of refining Emptiness and uniting with the Dao,\nhe acts in non-action;\nwhen he responds to the Dao in its natural way,\nhe does without doing.\n\nPlain and unremarkable,\nwhat taste can there be?\nWithout taste,\nwhat can there be to weary of?\n\nAs for the great going to the small,\nthe waning yielding to the waxing,\nuntil the point of retribution—\nthis is not done with resentment,\nbut with virtue.\nAll these are the utmost transformations,\nthe complete fulfillment of cause and effect.\n\nYet in applying this,\nhe is even-handed without bias;\nin repaying resentment with virtue,\nthere is no strange sentiment.\n\nMoreover, virtue is the shared goodness of all people,\nto repay with virtue is to act with the natural,\npure,

      "translated_text": "Conforming to the Way of things, governing people with humanity,\neven in matters of greatness and smallness, excess and deficiency,\nall align with the movement of Heaven—\neach moment is the Dao,\neverywhere without deviation,\nyet never conflicting with oneself,\nnor offending others.\n\nAlas, this Dao is both supremely difficult and supremely easy,\nboth supremely vast and supremely minute.\n\nYet worldly cultivators, seeking swift results and immediate effects,\noften pursue what is difficult,\ndelight in what is grand,\nunaware that difficulty lies in ease,\nand that the foundation of the great lies in the small.\nThus, all great undertakings in the world must begin with the minute.\n\nHow much more so the Dao, the root of all things and affairs?\nCan it not be approached by first mastering ease before difficulty,\nand smallness before greatness?\n\nOtherwise, those who advance too swiftly will retreat just as quickly—\nhow then could they hope to attain the realm of divine transformation?\n\nTherefore, the sages of old knew that the Dao has stages to ascend,\nthat learning has a path to progress.\nThey did not contemplate distant grandeur,\nbut focused solely on the immediate essence,\nrefining dross, nurturing the source—\nlike water seeping into grass and wood,\nnaturally changing day by day, month by month,\ngrowing without visible growth.\n\nThus, from the subtle beginnings,\nfrom the crude to the refined,\nfrom action and affairs to non-action and non-doing—\nthe more insipid, the richer;\nthe nearer, the farther—\nuntil the attainment of sublime greatness.\n\nThe sage never seeks the great directly,\nand thus achieves it.\n\nToday’s scholars, at their very outset,\nalready aspire to become immortals.\nThe greater their ambition, the harder the task,\nand most falter halfway through.\n\nOnly by persevering with steadfast endurance,\nby maintaining an unyielding, ceaseless resolve,\ncan the difficult become easy,\nand the great be grasped through the small.\n\nI urge scholars to seek difficulty in ease,\nto achieve greatness through the minute,\nto proceed with measured patience and maturity,\nlest they rush to recklessness and superficiality.\n\nOtherwise, not only will they fail to grasp the Dao’s profundity\nby cultivating a heart of sincerity and depth from the start,\nbut even in their most trivial promises,\nthose who act lightly will lack trustworthiness,\nand their regrets will only deepen.\nThose who seek ease will often encounter difficulty,\nand retreat will follow swiftly—\nthis is inevitable.\n\nThus, the sage’s cultivation begins with ease and smallness as its foundation,\nyet remains ever diligent and cautious—\nthis resolve never wanes.\nBy first addressing what is difficult,\nlater progress becomes as smooth as pushing a boat downstream,\nacting without effort—\nthus it is said, *\"In the end, there is no difficulty.\"*\n\nThese three phrases—*\"For non-action\"*\n—are the pure work of spontaneous alignment.\n\nWhat follows—*\"Seeking difficulty in ease\"*\n—expresses the intent that profound mastery must begin with the shallow and near.\n\nAs for the Alchemical Way,\nspeaking of lead and mercury—\nwhat are these things?\nLet it be clarified:\nThis matter concerns only the two poles of yin and yang.\n\nWhen mercury is paired with lead,\nit is as the female paired with the male.\nAfter their union, primordial *qi* is generated,\nthen this *qi* is merged with yin *qi* in the central palace,\nand thus the elixir is formed.\n\nIn the primordial state, *Li* (離) is the pure yang of *Qian* (乾),\nand *Kan* (坎) is the pure yin of *Kun* (坤).\nWhen the *qi* mechanism moves,\nthe central *yao* of *Qian* enters *Kun*,\nand the central *yao* of *Kun* enters *Qian*’s cavity—\n*Qian* thus becomes empty and turns into *Li*,\nwhile *Kun* becomes solid and turns into *Kan*.\nHence, though *Qian* is yang, it contains yin,\nand though *Kun* is yin, it contains yang—\nyet it is not the original pure yin, pure yang, or the undifferentiated *Tai Ji*.\n\nStill, it remains authentic.\nWith time, the spirit generates essence,\nand *qi* transforms into blood,\ngiving rise to the nature of substance and *qi*,\nand the fate of life’s measure.\n\nSince there is a mind with thought and awareness,\nand a body of *qi*, blood, and form,\nit differs from the original *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nThe adept, through methodical cultivation,\ndraws the single point of *yi* mercury from *Li*’s center—\n(mercury is heart fluid;\nthough fluid belongs to yin,\nit arises from *Li* fire and carries its nature)—\nand descends it into *Kan*’s palace,\ninfusing *Kan*’s single point of yin blood—\n(blood is *Kan* water;\nthough water belongs to yang,\nit emerges from *Kan* water and is essentially cold)—\nas the ancients said:\n*\"Fire enters the water domain,\"*\n*\"Spirit enters the *qi* realm.\"*\nLike ice encountering fire,\nor charcoal heating a pot,\nit naturally warms, generating a pulsating *qi* of yin vitality.\n\nThough fire enters water,\nit is like adding charcoal beneath a pot—\nthe rising heat steams upward in vigor,\nand true lead is born.\n\nGuided by the spirit, it ascends to the *niwan* (cinnabar field)—\njust as alcohol vapors rise in a heated still,\ncondensing into dew that drips into the jar—\n(which is what our teaching calls *\"true mercury,\"*\nor *\"Hurry, pour the North Sea’s first tidewater\nto nourish the old tree’s roots\"*).\nIn truth, *qi* has transformed into fluid.\n\nReturning to the furnace for warmth and nourishment,\nthe fluid again becomes *qi*,\ncycling endlessly in ascent and descent,\nuntil the body of *qi* and blood is exhausted,\nyin *qi* is stripped away,\nand the mortal form is transmuted into a golden body,\nthe turbid transformed into the pure,\nrestoring the original *Tai Ji*—\nthe law-body of non-arising and non-perishing.\n\nThe late Zhu Yuan Yu once said:\n*\"When speaking of *Kan* and *Li*,\nthe essence of *Li* and the *qi* of *Kan* within the body\nare both vulgar lead.\nOnly when *Kan* and *Li* unite,\nand true yin and true yang converge,\ndoes a single point of true yang emerge—\nthis is the seed of primordial true lead.\nYet without a master’s oral instructions,\neven if one forcibly restrains it,\none can only preserve the color of the body.\nWhen the lower *dan*tian is full and strong,\nit will inevitably collapse over time.\nThe student who attains this yang birth\nhas only completed half the work—\nhow could they hope to gestate and become a sage?\n\nOnly by drawing this yang *qi* upward,\nmerging it with the body’s yin essence,\nand further combining it with the spirit marrow and essence fluid of the *niwan* and *jiangong* (vermilion palace)—\nthis is truly *\"The eastern household’s daughter (wood mercury),\nthe western neighbor’s son (gold lead),\nuniting as husband and wife in the nuptial chamber.\"*",

instant surrender,\nand quell the disturbance before it took root—\nits ease was indeed so great.\n\nThis discipline of self-refinement is still relatively attainable;\nbut if one seeks to perfect the **Nine Transformations**,\nit cannot be measured by years and months.\n\nHow many are the ordinary, mundane folk\nwho do not know that the **Dao/Way** is the great path of Heaven and Earth,\nand that humanity is the true person of the cosmos!\nSome may chance upon a **dharma** assembly\nand attain fulfillment in a single lifetime;\nsome may miss the right **karmic conditions**\nand require several lifetimes before completion;\nsome may undergo repeated cultivation and many trials,\nencountering fortunate circumstances,\nyet fail to perfect their **virtue/power**—\ntheir nature perverse, their disposition flawed—\nthey nearly succeed, then fail,\nand in failing, never attain.\n\nTruly profound are the mysteries of the **Great Dao/Way**,\nnot easily fathomed!\n\nIf one does not know the **Dao/Way** has its own means of realization,\nlet them observe how things come to fruition:\nA tree with arms to embrace—\nits origin was but a tiny sprout—\nthrough the nurturing warmth of yin and yang,\nchanging daily and monthly,\ngrows into a great tree.\n\nA nine-tiered tower—\nits foundation was merely piled earth—\nthrough human labor and diligent gathering,\never renewing and flourishing day by day,\nsuddenly becomes a towering edifice.\n\nOr, as with a unified realm of rivers and mountains,\na thousand *li* of territory to traverse—\ncould one expect to reach it with a single step,\nor measure the journey by days?\nIts beginning is but one step at a time,\nfrom near to far,\nuntil at last one arrives.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is called great,\nfor it truly encompasses the vastness of Heaven and Earth,\nthe capacity to nurture all beings—\nhow could it not require layered effort to attain,\nor winding progress to unfold?\n\nOnly those who deeply grasp the **Dao/Way**\ndo not seek swift results,\ndo not measure progress by near gains—\nthough gold and jade may be polished,\ntheir resolve remains unpolished;\nthough seasons change,\ntheir diligence does not wane—\nthus, they grow from small to great,\nfrom low to high,\nfrom near to far,\njust as the tree with arms to embrace,\nthe nine-tiered tower,\nor the thousand-*li* journey—\nand suddenly

goes:\n*\"If Heaven had emotions, Heaven would grow old;\nthe sun moves without intent, yet its light remains constant.\"*\nIs this not the truth?\n\nThus, the ancient sages\nrefined the **Dao/Way**

conduct,\nthose who abandon moral restraint and indulge in licentiousness\nneed not be spoken of—\neven among those who pursue the **Dao/Way**,\nwhether they cling to emptiness or solidity,\nto attachment or non-attachment,\nall are errors.\n\nNow, I alone follow the methods of the ancients,\nembrace the **Dao/Way** of old,\nand express my own views—\nnot to claim they surpass all others,\nbut to weigh the **Great Dao/Way** as a standard.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is my own **Dao/Way**,\nlearning is my own learning—\nI find it through myself,\nand it is self-attained—\nwhat need is

blessing.**” **[98]**\nWhy is this so?\n\nIt is because if the people are given knowledge,\ntheir undifferentiated sincerity is already broken;\nif they remain in ignorance and unawareness,\ntheir

(*Xuándé*).\nAll that can be named is not **Mysterious Virtue/Power**;\nonly what cannot be named or spoken of,\ndeep and boundless, distant and unfathomable—**[106]**\nthis can be called **Mysterious

**[112]**\nbut it is not yet truly reversing with things. **[113]\n\nTo govern the state, one should not value cleverness,\nbut to cultivate the **Dao/Way**, one must especially cherish *qu* (愚).\nIndeed, cleverness is the state’s thief,\nwhile *qu* (愚) is the seed of the **Dao/Way**.\n\nHow can *qu* (愚) be the seed of the **Dao/Way**?\nConsider: within **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*), **[114]**\nthere is no thought or concern,\nno knowledge—**[115]**\nis this not what is called *qu* (愚)?\n\nSuddenly awakening within it,\nthis is the **non-arising, non-perishing** (*wúshēng wúmiè*) **[116]**\noriginal nature.\nNo one can claim to hold onto this awakening,\nto cultivate the **Supreme and Perfect Awakening** (*shàngshì zhèngjué zhèngjué*) **[117]**\nand thereby escape the cycle of rebirth,\nunsubjected to the **influence of yin and yang** (*yīnyáng gǔzhào*), **[118]**\nunbound by ghosts and spirits.\n\nEven within this **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*), **[119]**\nif one suddenly awakens,\nand I guard this true awakening without letting it disperse,\nthis single awakening has already reached **Prajñāpāramitā** (*bōluómí*). **[120]\nIf one can steadfastly uphold it,\nconstantly guard it,\nthen the seeds of rebirth\nwill be severed from here.\n\nIf one gives rise to another thought,\nor forms another view,\nthis is the **postnatal awareness of desire** (*shòutiān shíyù zhī shén*) **[121]**\nmixing in—**[122]**\nwhat is said:\n“**Infinite movements give rise to the root of birth and death,\nthe deluded call it the original person.**” **[123]\n\nIn essence, the spirit is one,\nbut desire makes it two.\nTwo thoughts, three minds,\nare the **defiled roots and dust** (*záwàng gēnchén*) **[124]**\nthat lead to the path of birth and death.\nOnly with one mind,\nno dual thoughts,\nhaving right awareness,\nno deluded mind—**[125]**\nthe **Dao/Way** lies here.\n\nIf one can further dissolve this single right awareness,\nthis is the **Great Ultimate returning to the Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí huán yú Wújí*), **[126]**\nand the **Golden Immortals’** (*Jīnxian*) **[127]**\nrealization lies within this refining of the void.\n\nWhat is **refining the void** (*liànxū*)?\nIt is like in the state of **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*), **[128]**\nmuddled and confused,\nas *qu* (愚) as if drunk,\nwith no awareness and no knowledge—**[129]**\nthis is the void.\nWhen seated practice reaches **no self, no person**, **[130]**\nno place, no heaven,\nthis too is refining the void.\n\nIt is further said:\n“The essentials of learning the **Dao/Way** begin with forgetting the self,\nthen forgetting others, **[131]**\nthen forgetting the **Dao/Way** itself,\nuntil one reaches the **forgetting of forgetting** (*wàngwàng zhī jí*) **[132]**\n—this is the ultimate attainment.\n\nIf one can take this single moment as master,\nand use true awakening as function,\nthe **Dao/Way** is not distant.\n\nHowever, though the method of refining the void is thus,\nits practice must begin with refining the nature.\nAncient people called this **forging the mirror** (*zhùjìng*). **[133]\n\nIf the mind is not refined,\none is dim and confused,\nunaware even if it is right before one’s eyes—**[134]**\nhow much more so for those who possess the **Six Perfections** (*liùtōng*)? **[135]\nIf one’s mind is still clouded by private desires,\nthen one has not yet reached the void.\n\nAfter true awakening,\none must not allow even a thread or fragment of desire to remain in one’s chest—**[136]\nthen the **Numinous Platform’s** (*Língtái*) **[137]**\nprecious mirror will always shine brightly,\nand yet it need not be fully perfected and complete—**[138]\nit is the emission of a single ray of light.\n\nEven within this **undifferentiated unity** (*húnhún*), **[139]**\nif one suddenly gains a single awareness,\nand no longer knows anything else,\nif one suddenly awakens,\nand no longer seeks another awakening—**[140]\nthis single moment is already piercing and bright,\nreaching all four directions without obstruction.\n\nThough students of the **Dao/Way** have a full vessel of private desires,\nsuddenly to expect purity like white jade or gold—**[141]\nhow could this be achieved by a single moment of voidness?\nIt is necessary first to forge the **Yin and Yang Swords** (*cíhóng èr jiàn*), **[142]**\nto eliminate the **demons of form and no-form** (*yǒuxíng wúxíng zhī mó*). **[143]\n\nIf these swords are not sharp,\nthen the **demons of desire, form, heaven, and humans** (*yùmó, sèmó, tiānmó, rénmó*) **[144]\ncannot be swept away and thoroughly purged,\nand the **true face of the Great Primordial** (*Qínyuán zhēnmiànmù*) **[145]\ncannot be revealed.\n\nFor human desires and

and before,\nrevering their teachings, fearing their spirit,\nand endlessly receiving their grace and virtue—\nhow could they then dare to contend for superiority or precedence,\nand vie with the Sage for victory?\n\nThis is an analogy for elixir refinement:\nfirst, the divine fire descends into the elixir field,\nthen the fire steams and the water boils,\nand gold forms at the water’s base—\nonly

      "translated_text": "「——The Dao/Way thus uses the vastness of the river and sea and the nobility of the Sage to illustrate the heart,\nwhile the smallness of the valleys and the lowliness of the myriad people serve to illustrate the hundred bodies,\nillustrating the **elixir field**.\n\nPractitioners of the Dao/Way must also take \"descending\" as their foundation,\ntake \"lowliness\" as their base,\nand not place themselves above the noble and exalted,\nso that they may descend beneath others—\nthus what they achieve will be effortless.\n\nAs for ordinary mortals,\ntheir essence (*shén*) is the master,\nwhile their *qi* follows its movements of activity and rest,\ngiving rise to birth and death,\nto the creation and nurturing of males and females.\n\nBut the **Perfect Person** (*zhìrén*) takes *qi* as the master,\nand their essence (*shén*) obeys its transformations and shifts.\nAs the *Treasure of Awakening* says,\n*\"Though others are the hosts, I am the guest\"*—this is so.\n\nFor those who truly cultivate the Dao/Way,\nwhen the *qi* moves,\nthey reverse the workings of Nature,\nupset the order of Heaven and Earth,\nand merely listen as it ascends and descends,\nenters and exits the furnace,\nsealing and refining—\nthen await the true essence,\ncycling and turning,\nnever relying on the essence (*shén*) to govern it.\n\nBut when they observe the true *qi* in its harmonious surge,\nand reverse the natural order in their cultivation,\nthe work is complete in nine cycles,\nthe elixir ripens, the pearl becomes luminous—\nis this not exalted, towering above all?\n\nResplendent, they stand first—\nyet how can they be the revered ones of the ten thousand households,\nthe objects of admiration for all under Heaven?\n\nOnly when they dwell in lowliness and follow behind in this manner,\ndoes their single-minded and tranquil aspiration,\ntheir humble and harmonious heart,\nprevent the overturning of the elixir field or the furnace,\nthe flight of mercury or the scattering of lead.\nThus, when they are above, others do not weigh them down;\nwhen they are before, others do not harm them.\nSince they do not contend,\nall under Heaven cannot contend with them.\n\n**Chapter 67: I Possess Three Treasures**\nAll under Heaven say I am great—\nit seems I do not resemble them.\nFor only the great can seem not to resemble them;\nif I resembled them, long ago I would have been small.\n\nI possess Three Treasures,\nwhich I hold and preserve:\nthe first is called **compassion** (*cí*),\nthe second is called **frugality** (*jiǎn*),\nthe third is **not daring to act before all under Heaven**.\n\nFor compassion (*cí*) brings forth courage;\nfrugality (*jiǎn*) brings forth breadth;\nnot daring to act before all under Heaven\nbrings forth completion and longevity.\n\nNow to abandon compassion (*cí*) for courage,\nto abandon frugality (*jiǎn*) for breadth,\nto abandon following behind for acting first—\nthis is death.\n\nFor compassion (*cí*), when used in battle, brings victory;\nwhen used in defense, brings firmness.\nWhen Heaven intends to save them,\nit shields them with compassion (*cí*).\n\nThe Dao/Way is originally boundless,\nyet it is also the **Great Ultimate** (*tàijí*).\nNeither great nor small,\nneither great nor small—\nit is both great and small.\n\nThere are indeed words beyond thought and conjecture that cannot be exhausted.\nIf one insists on calling it \"great,\"\nthen *\"the boundless and mighty *qi*,\nfilling the space between Heaven and Earth\"* is the description.\nIf one seeks to depict it as \"small,\"\nthen *\"the nameless gem,\nmost hidden and subtle,\nconcealed in the vast expanse\"* is the portrayal.\n\nIn its relation to humanity,\nto possess it means life,\nto lose it means death.\nAll arise from the boundless yet manifest,\nfrom the subtle yet becoming substantial.\n\nFor indeed, the origin lies in the subtle,\nwhile its unfolding is in the great.\nBetter to speak of its smallness to reveal the Dao/Way\nthan to speak of its greatness to explain it.\n\nThus the Dao/Way says,\n*\"All under Heaven says I am great.\"*\n\nFor \"I\" is the Dao/Way itself.\nThe Dao/Way originally has no form, no body—\nyet now it is called \"great,\"\nwhich implies the Dao/Way has form and body that can be likened—\nthis seems not to resemble the Dao/Way.\n\nOnly the great cannot be named as \"great,\"\nso it does not resemble what others call \"great.\"\nIf one wishes to embody the Dao/Way of Heaven,\nto resemble my form,\nfrom the opening of Heaven to the present day,\nthose who established the poles of Heaven,\nwho expounded the Dao/Way and clarified the teachings—\nlong ago,\nthey all used the **Ultimate of Boundlessness** (*wújí*) as the ultimate,\nthe **non-divine essence** (*bùshén*’s *shén*) as the essence,\nthe most subtle and minute as the Dao/Way.\n\nYet the Dao/Way is so silent and odorless,\nso vague and distant—\nhow then can scholars begin to cultivate it?\n\nThe Dao/Way says,\n*\"I possess Three Treasures,\nwhich I hold and preserve.\"*\nIf one earnestly does not lose them,\ntreasures them as treasures,\nand never forgets them,\nthen one may return to the origin,\nrestore the source,\nand revive the primordial descent of the Sovereign.\n\nWhat are these Three Treasures?\nThe first is compassion (*cí*), which is also **benevolence** (*rén*).\nBenevolent and compassionate,\nit is the fundamental essence of Heaven.\nThe gentleman embodies benevolence (*rén*),\nand this suffices to nurture humanity.\n\nMoreover, it encompasses the four cardinal virtues,\nand includes all virtues—\nbenevolence (*rén*) is within them,\nand thus the Dao/Way is within them.\nPursue it to its fullest,\nand it can embrace Heaven and Earth,\npermeate past and present.\n\nThis is the foundation of the **Golden Elixir** (*jīndān*),\nwhich cultivators should earnestly treasure and reflect upon.\n\nYet its Dao/Way extends to the utmost greatness,\nwhile its roots arise from the utmost subtlety.\nIf one does not know to forget all thoughts,\nto inwardly illuminate with a single awareness,\nbut instead only strives for breadth and becomes scattered,\nfor comprehensiveness and becomes superficial,\nthen they will gain nothing of benevolence (*rén*),\nnothing of the Dao/Way.\n\nOnly when one turns inward to seek within themselves,\nsteadfastly guards it in the heart,\nand when they wish to establish, they establish for others,\nwhen they wish to reach, they reach for others—\nthis is the ancient saying:\n*\"To grasp one is to accomplish all ten thousand affairs.\"*\nIs this not the essence of frugality (*jiǎn*)?\n\nFor frugality (*jiǎn*) is the method to seek benevolence (*rén*),\nthe key to cultivating the Dao/Way.\nScholars, having known its compassion (*cí*),\nshould further nourish it with frugality (*jiǎn*),\nonly then can they align with the Dao/Way.\n\nAlthough,\nif one is self-proclaimed as great and exalted,\nand lacks the measure of humility and harmony,\nthen within they only know themselves,\nand outwardly they disdain all others.\nThey boast of their cleverness,\nand arrogantly claim wisdom—\nthey proudly declare themselves as those who first awaken and first harmonize,\noften believing that none under Heaven can surpass them—\nin the end,\ntheir nature is not tranquil,\ntheir *qi* is not harmonious,\nand even if they wish for the elixir to complete nine cycles,\nfor the Dao/Way to reach the ninth heaven—\nthis is difficult indeed.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The essential key to refining the elixir is\nto take **awakened awareness** (*língjué*) as the Dao/Way’s form,\nand **harmonious surge** (*chōnghé*) as the Dao/Way’s function.\nThus, in all things and places,\none should not dare to act before all under Heaven.\"*\n\nMoreover, compassion (*cí*) is\nthe innate capacity of human hearts.\nTo exhaust one’s own heart\nin establishing the fate of all things—\nwhat a vast vow!\nTo nourish the nature of a single inch\nin seeking the peace of all things—\nwhat a mighty spirit!\n\nThose who guard compassion (*cí*)\nare those who cultivate courage.\nZengzi said to Zixiang,\n*\"When reflecting upon oneself and not shrinking back,\neven if clad in coarse garments and living in a humble dwelling,\nI would not fear.\"*」",

cow trembling in fear, could not bear to harm it,\nor a commoner who, upon witnessing a weak child fall into a well, feels a surge of pity—\nthese are all stirrings of the *ren* heart,\nwhere the *Dao*’s gentle breath returns.\n\nWhen one reflects upon this,\nthis impulse, this thought, is ever-present—\nonly fearing that men may not yet perceive it.\n\nScholars must begin from the natural and true,\nexpanding and cultivating outward,\nthus laying the foundation for elixir refinement.\n\nYet one must not seek breadth at the expense of neglect—\nonly guard simplicity and subtlety.\n\nWith a single mind devoted to preserving life,\nand the five senses in full submission,\nthe ancients said:\n*\"The heart must dwell within the chest,\nand thoughts must never stray beyond the *Zongzhi* gate.\"*\n\nFrom this, the more refined the simplicity,\nthe broader the expansion;\nthe more subtle the essence,\nthe more manifest its brilliance.\n\nThe more precise the restraint,\nthe more vast its reach.\nCan scholars not take frugality as their root?\n\nThough *virtue/power* lies in humility,\nstrict simplicity is indeed a fine method to avoid loss—\nyet if one does not temper it with modesty and harmony,\nthe danger of impulsive violence may arise,\nlike flames scorching the elixir.\nThus, guarding simplicity must also be utterly harmonious,\never humble, ever small,\nnever presuming to lead—\nonly then does one achieve *emptiness* and serve others.\n\nWhen compassion is ever-present,\nthe *Dao*’s breath will surely remain.\n\nIf one values courage over compassion,\nluxury over frugality,\nand seeks to lead rather than follow,\nhow can one hope to possess the Three Treasures,\nunshaken and unlost?\n\nMoreover, compassion brings favor—\nuse it in battle, and victory will be certain;\nemploy it in defense, and the fortress will stand firm.\nThis is like the metaphor of tending the furnace,\nburning away the Three Corpses of malice,\nand bathing in the *Dao*’s purity—\nthus safeguarding the embryo, the fetus, and the original spirit.\n\nIt is this gentle and harmonious heart\nthat is essential for refining the elixir and nurturing the *Dao*.\n\nConsider that Heaven, in creating man,\ngrants him life and endows him with compassion—\nnone are without it.\nIf one can temper thoughts to align with compassion,\nthe elixir of eternal life is already within reach.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Virtue of Non-Contention**\nA true warrior does not rely on force,\na true fighter does not rage,\na true victor does not contend,\nand a true leader serves those beneath him.\n\nThis is the virtue of non-contention,\nthis is the power of serving others,\nthis is aligning with Heaven—\nthe ancient ideal.\n\nWarriors (*shì*, 士), are judges of men.\nJudges of men wield armies,\nand their essence is martial valor.\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"Firm yet responsive, venturing risks while yielding to them,\nmighty in spirit yet never slaying.\"*\nThis is martial valor without violence—\nthe warrior’s true excellence.\n\nWhen facing a great enemy,\ntwo armies locked in battle,\none must not fail to deploy troops,\nbrandish weapons, and charge with the fury of rivers and thunder.\nYet, when examined closely,\nsoldiers are few—\nyet a mighty foe suddenly presses the borders.\nIt is not difficult to repel the invaders of the Central Plains\nwith music, or to break the siege of a hostile state\nwith harmonious melodies.\nThis is the power of unyielding yet without anger—\nthe iron mace tempered in gentleness.\n\nWhen the time comes to return in triumph,\nvibrant with victory,\nwhile others boast in the court,\nhe alone humbles himself—\nthe so-called \"Great Tree General\"—\nand can stand without shame.\n\nEven if rewards are lavishly bestowed,\nhe remains ever modest—\nthis is how the true victor does not contend.\n\nThe *Shū* says:\n*\"You alone do not contend,\nand thus none under Heaven can contend with you.\"*\nIs this not what it means?\n\nSuch men arise from heeding wise counsel,\ngathering broad thoughts for mutual benefit,\nnot relying on their own talents,\nbut using the talents of others as their own;\nnot boasting of their own wisdom,\nbut employing the wisdom of others as their own.\n\nThis is the meaning of humbling oneself to serve others.\nIf one does not listen to noble words,\nconsult good paths,\nkeep an open heart like a valley,\nand maintain modesty while shining with virtue,\nhow can one hope to rule the world\nwith the skill of a warrior or victor?\n\nThis is the virtue of non-contention,\nwhich wins the people.\n\nThis is the power of serving others,\nwhich commands the world.\n\nThis is the way of following the people below,\naligning with Heaven above—\nthus winning the hearts of the people.\n\nThis is the power of serving others,\nwhich commands the world.\n\nThis is the way of following the people below,\naligning with Heaven above—\nto stand with Heaven and Earth,\nand achieve the ancient ideal of humanity.\n\nAlas! Without the saint’s utmost sincerity,\nexhausting his nature,\nhow could one, in the midst of war and chaos,\nembody the spirit of peace and courtesy,\nwielding force without violence,\nacting in anger yet without rage,\ncontending yet without strife?\n\nAnd when it comes to ruling with benevolence,\nplanning with humility,\nplacing the worthy in office,\nand employing the capable in their roles—\nthe men of the world all offer their loyalty,\npour out their sincerity,\nand eagerly rush to perform their duties,\nsacrificing their lives as commanded—\nas the seasons flow naturally without speech,\nand all things present their offerings in harmony,\nthis is how one aligns with Heaven and Earth\nand achieves the ancient ideal of humanity.\n\nThe *Shī* says:\n*\"Ponder the virtuous Lord Ji, who aligned with Heaven,\nand none could surpass his excellence.\"*\nIf not for such men, who else could we follow?\n\nThis speaks of the elixir’s growth and the furnace’s fire—\nthough there are methods of fierce refining and rapid tempering,\nthey must still adapt to the moment,\nfollow the natural course,\nand act with force without violence—\nthus avoiding the calamity of overturned elixir or shattered crucible.\n\nWhen the *qi*’s movement is unrestrained,\nthe true *yang* energy flourishes,\nmighty and unyielding,\nfilling the two great voids—\nwhat difference is there from a warrior’s blazing fury,\nsweeping all before him?\n\nEven when gathering and refining the fire,\nit is only because the boundless *qi* is expanded—\nnot a love of strength for its own sake.\n\nThus, after purification,\ncommon bones transmute into jade bones,\nand mortal flesh becomes a golden body.\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"Taking the Golden Elixir in the palm of one’s hand\nis like seizing the world as one would pick up a mustard seed.\"*\n\nOnly when the spirit is concentrated without distraction,\nand breath is regulated without effort,\ndoes one purely follow Heaven,\nunmixed with human interference.\nEven when Heaven and man clash,\nreason and desire vie,\none must not fail to suppress desire with reason,\nand exhaust humanity to merge with Heaven.",

losing what is most precious.\nThus, when armies clash,\nthe compassionate prevail.\n\nAncient strategists spoke thus:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor but must be the guest.\"*\nThe aggressor is like a sovereign—\none who issues commands and rules with authority;\nthe guest is like a minister—\none who obeys the sovereign’s will, as in *\"Let others be the host, I the guest.\"*\n\nThus, when I am the aggressor,\nit is the post-Heaven human heart that takes command,\nwhile the pre-Heaven Dao-heart steps back in submission.\nHow dare I make the post-Heaven human heart the aggressor,\nonly to then make it the guest,\nrelying on it as if it were my very life?\n\n*\"I dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot\"* means:\nwhen victorious, even an inch gained must be held firm;\nwhen defeated, not even a single step withdrawn may be conceded.\nTo advance an inch in gain while retreating a foot in loss—\nthis is to gain little and lose much,\neasy to fail, hard to succeed.\nIn warfare, this is the mark of an incompetent general;\nin Dao cultivation, this is the fate of one who achieves nothing.\nHow dare I?\n\nOnly by yielding to others as the aggressor,\nsubmitting myself as the guest,\ncan I ensure they have openings to exploit,\nwhile I have no vulnerabilities to attack—\nthus controlling others without being controlled,\navoiding humiliation.\n\nAdvance when opportunity arises,\nretreat when danger looms.\nIn advancing, one must rouse the spirit of boldness;\nin retreating, one must not present a vulnerable posture.\nSuch caution, such vigilance—\nit is nothing but always yielding precedence to others,\nwhile placing oneself last.\n\nThus, when marching an army,\nit seems others can move while I cannot;\nyet when I press forward with resolve,\nbrandishing my arms—\nit seems others have arms while I have none.\nWhen facing the enemy in battle,\ntwo armies locked in combat—\nit seems others can contend while I cannot.\n\nThough drums thunder and flags billow,\nthough they wield weapons, I do not lack arms.\nYet I advance not lightly, retreat not lightly—\ntruly knowing that the fate of the state,\nthe rise or fall of the nation,\nrests on this single battle.\nHow can the enemy be treated with contempt?\n\nObserve the ancients who treated the enemy with caution—\nthey often succeeded;\nthose who underestimated the enemy—\nthey often failed.\nAs seen in Guan Zhong’s campaign against the Shanrong,\nor Zi Yu’s battle at Chengpu.\n\nMoreover, the prosperity or decline of the court\ndepends on the success or failure of its generals.\nIf one does not approach matters with utmost prudence,\nbut instead flaunts their talent or relies on their wit,\nboasting *\"None surpass me\"*—\nlike Meng Ming’s reckless advance or Gao Gu’s overconfidence—\nthere has never been one who did not bring ruin to the state,\ndestroy their own house,\nor extinguish their ancestral rites.\n\nThe Sage’s greatest treasure is *xin*

either do not war,\nor if they do, they prevail.\nIs this not because the heart of sorrow\nextends to others,\nentering their very beings?\n\nThis illustrates the birth of true *yang* energy,\nthe *qi* flourishing—\nonly then may the fire be refined.\nIf one does not patiently await the *yin* [lead] *qi*’s movement,\nbut instead forces the spirit’s ascent and descent,\nadvance and retreat in

      "translated_text": "「Now let us further elucidate the subtleties of the **Dao/Way**:\n\nIn general, when practicing seated meditation (*dàzuò*), one must first cultivate **定** (meditative stability) within the **離宮** (Palace of Rebirth), achieving a single resonance before self-reflection and self-verification. If indeed it is found to be utterly empty and devoid of substance, then the mind is clarified and **性** (true nature) is seen.\n\nThus, I have often said: At the outset of still-sitting, this mind hangs suspended in the **太虚** (Great Emptiness). Only when the body and mind are settled, and **意** (intent) and **氣** (qi) are harmonized, does one gradually gather and return the mind to reflect upon its own **本宫** (Root Palace). When one arrives at the state of absolute emptiness, with nothing between the chest, then from this moment of awakening and illumination, the **十方三界** (Ten Directions and Three Realms) are nowhere that does not enter one’s awakened illumination.\n\nYet, **awakening-nature** neither arises nor perishes—it merely is, **了了自了** (clearly self-illuminating), **如如自如** (suchness self-so). Through this, one seeks the **玄** (Mysterious), and the source water becomes supremely pure, naturally becoming the foundation for my **結丹** (alchemical elixir).\n\nIn a flash, the **性光** (nature-light) spontaneously manifests. How does one perceive this? It is within the **恍恍惚惚** (dimly vague) state I previously demonstrated. Suddenly, upon awakening, movement occurs—this is the essential beginning of cultivating the Dao/Way. Yet, to gather **情** (passions) with **性** (nature), if one does not first uncover the true nature of **性**, and abruptly descends into the **水府** (Abode of Water) to seek the Mysterious, how can one possibly gather **情** when there is no **性**?\n\nFor indeed, there exists the **虛靈** (void-spirit) and **蓬勃** (vigorous) **機** (mechanism). Know that **離** is not of the mind—when one concentrates the ears on sound, the eyes on light, and restrains the senses from scent, taste, and touch, these are all affairs of the **神火** (spiritual fire), hence it is called **屬離** (attributed to Rebirth). **坎** is not **氣** (qi)—wherever **精氣** (essence-qi) resides, it is **屬坎** (attributed to Abyss). Even if one directs the spirit into the blood, and the fire into the water, the **氣機** (qi-mechanism) may not yet be activated—one must firmly grasp and pull, stirring the waves from the **海底** (ocean’s depths), ascending them into the **丹田** (Elixir Field). After prolonged refining, when the **火功** (fire cultivation) is sufficient, suddenly the **天機** (heavenly mechanism) is activated, causing the entire body to surge with vitality, from the ten fingers to the whole body, ceaselessly trembling. The body stands like a wall, the intent as cold as ashes. When the **丹田**’s **氣** grows warm, this is the **火** (fire) at its **不老不嫩** (neither too strong nor too weak) peak of coalescence. If this effect is not observed, one remains merely **微微** (slightly faint), and fire cannot be practiced. If one sees this state for long yet fails to ignite the fire, only then does one apply fire to the already dissipated **氣**—this is the **藥老無用** (elixir past its prime, useless).\n\nStudents must carefully discern this.\n\nHowever, when the **微陽** (subtle yang) first stirs, it may not immediately produce such vigorous **氣**—one need only settle the mind and ease the intent, harmonizing the breath, and may proceed with the **子午河車** (Child-Midday Elixir Circulation). For indeed, the human body possesses **形質** (form-substance) blood, which remains **污污渾渾** (filthy and turbid), a mass of stagnant blood, unless refined by the **神火** (spiritual fire). Only through the illumination of the spiritual fire does a single point of **真氣** (true qi) emerge from the blood.\n\nThis is what the **Buddha** spoke of: *“In this fivefold turbid and evil world, I cultivated and attained the fruit of the Dao/Way.”*\n\nAgain, the ancients said: *“To take treasure from the ghost’s nest, to seek lead beneath the black mountain”*—these are all but the **真氣** (true qi) extracted from turbid essence and decayed blood through the refining of spiritual fire. Once the **氣** (qi) moves, **陽** (yang) arises—one must then know that **子** (Child) advances the yang-light, while **午** (Midday) retreats the **陰符** (yin-symbol). The **卯酉沐浴** (Tiger-Dog Bathing) methods, when practiced, allow one to gather this **真陽** (true yang), making it circulate and flow internally to dispel the **陰私** (hidden yin) within the **臟腑** (zang-fu organs), and externally to attract the **天地靈陽** (heaven-earth’s numinous yang). With prolonged practice, the **氣質** (qi-nature) also transforms.\n\nThis method of **河車** (Elixir Circulation) holds boundless profundity. The ancients spoke of *“gas brightens, Child-Midday draws and adds”*—drawing refers to extracting **鉛** (lead) from the Abode of Water, and adding refers to supplementing **汞** (mercury) from the Palace of Rebirth. **汞** is the **靈液** (numinous fluid) within the heart, the **後天** (post-heaven) containing the **先天** (pre-heaven). From the **色身** (form-body), **渾精敗血** (turbid essence and decayed blood), the **神火** (spiritual fire) refines and produces this **甘露** (ambrosia)—this is **鉛** (lead), the **氣** (qi) within the blood. **氣** (Qi) is what the ancients called the **金** (gold) in water, a **先天** (pre-heaven) within **後天** (post-heaven); it can only solidify the **凡林** (mundane body), not generate the **法身** (Dharma-body).\n\nThis is the medicine produced by the **坎離交** (Abyss-Rebirth interaction), yet still insufficient for **神丹** (spiritual elixir). One must then gather **情** (passions) with **性** (nature), and return **性** to **性** (nature to nature), harmonizing **性情** (nature-passions) to refine together in the **坤爐** (Kun Furnace). Suddenly, the **真陽** (true yang) emerges, forming the **乾坤交** (Heaven-Earth interaction) to congeal the elixir—only then can one refine **神丹** (spiritual elixir) into the **真仙子** (true immortal embryo).\n\nIn summary, there is no other method of cultivation—only the **河車** (Elixir Circulation) turning.

Those people, unfortunate,\nborn not in the ancient age,\nfear authority as *de* (virtue/power) and *wei* (awe),\nrevere clarity as *ming* (illumination) and *huai* (embrace)—\nthus, in ignorance and transgression,\nHeaven’s signs are ignored,\nand droughts, floods, plagues, and famines arise in succession.\n\nOnly the rulers above should guide them\nto dwell in the boundless realm of the world,\nso that their minds may roam in the harmonious expanse of *Taihe*,\nnot confining themselves in narrowness,\nnor daily courting ruin;\nshould lead them to draw upon the vast *he* (noble) *qi*,\nso that they may nourish themselves in the pure and empty Heaven,\nnot exhausting their life,\nnor inviting self-destruction.\n\nOnly by cherishing the principle of preserving life,\nsafeguarding Heaven’s innate goodness,\nand never growing weary or decaying—\nthen the *Classic of Poetry* says:\n*\"Revere Heaven’s wrath,\nand dare not trifle with it;\nrevere Heaven’s decrees,\nand dare not rush blindly.\"*\n\nHeaven observes their virtue,\ngranting them prosperity and flourishing,\ngranting them longevity and preservation—\ntruly, they share in the eternal duration of Heaven and Earth.\nThus, they are not exhausted.\n\nWho but the Sage can achieve this?\n\nThe ancient emperors, reverent and non-actional,\nexalted in great virtue,\nday by day, month by month,\ncleansing their hearts and purifying their thoughts,\npenetrating the mysteries of creation,\ndiscerning the original Heaven—\nonly knew themselves.\n\nAs for deeds, writings, and outward achievements,\nthe Sage utterly rejects them as means of self-display.\n\nMoreover, he remains ever-vigilant, morning and evening,\ncherishing the Dao and guarding his essence,\nnever straying from *ren* for a single breath—\nnone can surpass him in this.\n\nHis self-love is such that\neven what others hold in highest esteem—\nnames, positions, fame, and glory—\nthe Sage does not deem them worthy of pride.\n\nThough the Sage’s own self-awareness and self-love\nare what all people commonly know and cherish—\nyet common people, knowing them, must display them,\nloving them, must exalt them;\nwhile the Sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nloves himself but does not exalt himself.\n\nHe is cautious in solitude, yet does not flaunt himself before others;\nhe values preservation, yet does not boast before the world.\nHow can common people compare?\n\nIt is said: abandon desire, fulfill humanity, align with Heaven,\nthus transcending humanity to become Sage,\nseparating from the common to become divine,\nand attaining immortality of countless eons—\nall this arises from\nself-awareness of dwelling in boundless ease,\nself-love of eternal joy,\nuniting in this and not dividing from it,\nso that the people naturally turn to goodness without knowing why.\n\nApart from this, how could it be so?\n\nThis speaks of not confining one’s dwelling—\nthen one’s dwelling must be vast.\nNot exhausting one’s life—\nthen one’s life must endure.\n\nYet in the practice, the original spirit and the recognizing spirit\nmust be understood.\n\nWhen a person first receives *qi*,\nfrom the moment of parents’ union,\na single grain of millet forms—\nat this time, indistinct and indistinct,\nonly a cluster of *Taihe* qi,\nwith no trace of knowledge.\n\nYet it is supremely divine, supremely wondrous,\nexhausting all transformations,\ngiving rise to boundless affairs in the world—\nall from this single spark of sentient qi,\nfrom non-knowing to knowing,\nfrom non-action to action,\nall beginning here.\n\nAt this stage, Heaven and humanity share one principle,\nthings and self share one source,\nsubstance and function are complete,\nmanifest and subtle are unbroken—\nthus, it is called the *original spirit*.\n\nThis is what Heaven bestows.\n\nWhen the flesh-and-blood form is complete,\nten months in the womb fulfilled,\na cry, and the infant is born—\nthen the *recognizing spirit* begins to take shape.\n\nThe *original spirit* is the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nshared by all things, hidden within the void.\nOnce it enters the human body,\nit dwells concealed in the empty cavities within.\n\nThis is Heaven’s gift.\nThose who cultivate the Great Dao\ncannot seek it through emptiness or form.\n\nOnly by being utterly without knowledge,\nutterly without possession,\nsweeping away all dust and haze,\ndoes the inner truth reveal itself,\nand divine mystery arise.\n\nAs for the *recognizing spirit*,\nit is the ghostly essence of the human body,\nthe seed of countless rebirths,\nrequiring the completion of the five senses\nand the hundred bones—\nonly when descending into birth and taking form\ndoes the soul have a place to depend upon.\n\nThe ancients called this the *postnatal recognizing spirit*,\nfor it arises from having form and body.\n\nThis is the great distinction between the *original spirit*.\n\nYet after birth, the two spirits—original and recognizing—\nmerge into one.\nSometimes the *original spirit* acts,\nwhile the *recognizing spirit*

clear,\nand the division between principle and desire is manifest.\n\nWhen desires are few but fail to be fully restrained,\nand one strives to avoid transgressions yet cannot—\nhere, with constant vigilance and earnest striving,\nreflecting on even the subtlest inclinations,\nand curbing the false and deceptive,\nit is not difficult to achieve purity of principle and clarity of mind,\nand instantly reveal the original face of things.\n\nBut in places where no one observes or hears,\nand where there is no daily practice of moral cultivation or self-restraint,\nwhen desires surge and emotions overwhelm,\nthinking to uproot evil and eradicate sin,\nand suddenly perceiving the true nature—\nthe result must be that evil is not uprooted but multiplies,\nand the more one strives to purify the heart, the more it becomes disordered.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* says: *\"The people do not fear death—how can you frighten them with death?\"*\nThe principle and its effect are thus interdependent—\nonly by being cautious in solitude can one truly know the falsity of desires.\nThen, when desires arise in the moment,\none can restrain them with resolve,\nand thus return to the rectitude of Heaven’s heart.\n\nWhen one thought is swept away,\nand another remains pure,\nevil will not spontaneously regenerate at that juncture.\n\nAs for the people who habitually fear death,\nthose who dare to transgress or disrespect\nand corrupt the norms of propriety,\nI shall seize and execute them—who will dare?\nFor the Daoist drives out the non-Daoist,\njust as a benevolent ruler soothes the masses,\ngoverns the common folk,\nand with utmost compassion restrains the most uncompassionate,\nwith supreme justice punishes the unjust—\nnaturally, none who submit will remain secure,\nwhile the near ones are content and the distant ones come,\npreventing the rise of rebellions or counterattacks,\nnor turning into enemies or causing harm.\n\nA scholar who seeks to discard falsehood and preserve sincerity,\nto return to the root and reflect on the origin,\nmust do so gradually and steadfastly,\nuntil one insight opens and all faculties become responsive,\nand the original spirit is at peace, obeying the commands of the mind.\n\nAs it is said, *\"If a person can remain constantly pure,\nthen all of Heaven and Earth shall be his domain.\"*\nAnd again: *\"If a person can rectify his spirit,\nthen all evils will not dare to approach.\"*\n\nThis is akin to the executioner’s punishment—\nno resentment when he kills,\nno unease when one dies—\nthe same natural Dao, the same rare effect.\n\n**Chapter 75: The Sage Values Life Less Than Nobility**\nThe people’s hunger arises from their rulers’ excessive tax consumption,\nthus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in governance stems from their rulers’ interference,\nthus they are hard to govern.\nThe people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ extravagant pursuit of life,\nthus they hold life lightly.\n\nOnly those who do not prioritize life itself\nare truly wiser than those who revere it.\n\nFrom ancient times, the people have been the foundation of the state,\nand food is their Heaven.\nA state without people—who shall support it?\nPeople without food—how shall they live?\n\nThus, for those in power,\nthere must be diligence in opening fields and cultivating land,\ndeepening the roots before the people have eaten;\nestablishing rites and moderating changes,\nregulating the flow after the people have eaten;\nand further, reducing labor to make up for shortages,\nand curtailing expenditures to aid those in need—\nso the people themselves provide ample sustenance,\nand there are no laments of scarcity or hunger.\nEven if drought strikes and famine follows,\nif the granaries are stocked,\nworries of calamity vanish.\n\nBut in the world today,\nrulers indulge in arrogance and licentiousness,\ntheir wasteful spending ever increasing:\nsome seek rare delights and curiosities for amusement,\nothers build palaces of jade and pavilions of precious stones to satisfy their desires.\nOften, the granaries are emptied,\nyet their expenditures do not diminish.\nEven basic provisions are lacking,\nand they impose heavier burdens:\nfirst, they add extra taxes and levies,\nstill fearing the people’s resistance;\nthen, they seize ruthlessly and demand excessively,\neven disregarding Heaven’s will.\nTheir love of music and beauty is paramount,\nluxury and extravagance reach their height.\nThey drain the vital essence of the people,\nwhile indulging their own debauchery.\nWhen the state’s treasury is exhausted,\nyet their demands relentlessly continue—\nhow can one expect no hunger,\neven in years of abundant harvests and frequent blessings?\n\nIn the age of *Zhuó Lóng*,\nclothing was for all, food for all,\nhomes for all, fields for all—\neach cherished their kin,\neach honored their elders.\nThe virtuous did not need to be taught rites and propriety,\nfor they naturally resided in benevolence and followed righteousness;\nthe common folk did not require lessons in loyalty and sincerity,\nfor they found contentment in their work and peace in their homes.\nThe ruler’s conduct itself was the governance,\nwhile the people transformed themselves effortlessly.\nCustoms were pure without intent,\nmanners ancient without seeking them—\nhow flourishing and harmonious was that era!\n\nBut later,\nas laws and regulations multiplied,\ncustoms grew ever more corrupt;\nthe more decrees were proclaimed,\nthe more thieves and bandits thrived.\nEven in tyrannical rulers, this is expected,\nbut even wise and enlightened kings,\nwho strive with vigor and exert themselves in governance,\nfind that the more complex their policies become,\nthe more falsehoods arise,\nand the stricter their laws,\nthe more deceitful schemes emerge.\nIs this not because the *qi* and its influence are hard to reverse,\nnor because Heaven’s will is unchangeable?\nOr is it because they fail to grasp the root and foundation,\nand instead seek remedies in superficial measures?\nNot only does this fail to benefit the people,\nit also burdens the Way of the world.\n\nThe people’s hearts are inherently without strife,\nyet their rulers disturb them with policies;\nthe people’s emotions are naturally without desire,\nyet their rulers disrupt them with rigid codes.\nFor every additional decree from the court,\nthe common folk devise a hundred more deceits;\nfor every new regulation,\nthe people invent a hundred more clever evasions.\nNo wonder the world’s ways are so corrupt,\nthe people’s hearts shift daily,\nand governance becomes ever more difficult.\n\nOnly when the ruler sits upright and relaxed,\ndoes the people

comes.\nThus, the more extravagant the pursuit of life,\nthe more lightly death is held.\n\nOnly those who do not regard life as an honor,\nnor place excessive weight on preserving it,\nwho take food

summer—\nwhen *yang* *qi* is fierce, all things flourish and grow,\nnone failing to thrive.\nBut when autumn and winter meet,\n*yin* *qi* prevails, and all things wither and fall.\n\nHuman and thing share the same source,\nwith no distinction between them.\nThus, all things under Heaven,\nwhether great or small,\nare companions of death in their rigidity,\nand companions of life in their softness.\n\nConsider warfare—\noften the strong are defeated,\nwhile the weak prevail—\nas when Ziyu’s overrigidity led to defeat,\nand Bibi’s yielding won victory over Chu.\nWhy is this?\nBecause the strong decline gradually,\nwhile the weak hold the seeds of rise—\nthus, they cannot prevail.\n\nObserve the trees—\nwood is most rigid,\nyet when *yin* *qi* is strong and *yang* *qi* weak,\nit is bound and broken,\nwith no way to nourish itself.\n\nThe strong and great exhaust their life *qi*,\nwhile death’s *qi* approaches—\ntruly, the lowest of things.\nThe soft and weak dissolve *yin* and

deficient it supplements.\nThe Way of Heaven supplements the deficient and diminishes the excessive,\nBut the Way of Man is otherwise—\nIt diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho then can serve the world with their excess?\nOnly the Sage of the Way.\n\nThus the Sage acts without relying,\nAchieves without dwelling—\nDoes he not wish to be seen as virtuous?\nThe Way of Heaven flows and nourishes all things,\nThrough ceaseless interplay of yin and yang,\nForward and backward, alternating without end—\nGreat, central, and perfectly just,\nNeither partial nor biased.\nHence, when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises;\nWhen yang reaches its extreme, yin arises.\nIf yin is excessive and yang is weak,\nThen yin is suppressed and yang is bolstered;\nIf yang is excessive and yin is weak,\nThen yang is suppressed and yin is bolstered.\nEbb and flow, swelling and waning,\nMove in harmony with the seasons,\nThus life and transformation unfold,\nAchieving effortless spontaneity,\nAn eternal, unexhausted Heaven.\nWhat differs from one who draws a bow?\nWith bow held firm and intent upright,\nThe body straight, the front and rear arms aligned—\nThe high is depressed, the low is raised,\nThe excessive is diminished, the deficient is supplemented.\nThen, following the natural motion,\nThe arrow finds its mark without fail.\nHow unlike the Way of Heaven’s natural course—\nTaking the people’s fat and marrow,\nFilling their bellies,\nYet often diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho then can use the ruler’s excess\nTo supplement the people’s deficiency?\nOnly the Sage of the Way,\nWho follows the Way of Heaven and aligns with human nature,\nDiminishing where diminished, supplementing where supplemented,\nSo that the common folk have no cause for grievance.\nThough acting for oneself,\nIt is still in accordance with the Way of Heaven—\nNever boasting of one’s deeds;\nThough achieving, it is only sincerity—\nNever claiming credit for one’s work.\nSuch a person,\nTruly aligns with Heaven’s effortless transformation,\nNot forcing the natural course,\nNot desiring to be seen in action.\nThe glory of creation shines upon all—\nIs it not because the virtuous do not seek to be seen as virtuous?\nThis is why Heaven has no limits,\nAnd only the Sage unites Heaven and Earth.\n\nAt birth, man is pure yin and pure yang,\nPerfectly balanced, neither superior nor inferior.\nThus, day by day, month by month,\nHis bones grow soft, his body weak yet thrives.\nAfter life begins,\nFire dwells above, water below—\nWater and fire do not intermingle,\nSo yin is always excessive, yang always deficient.\nWhen yang-water is scorched by yin-fire,\nThe human heart grows ever more restless,\nWorldly passions burn brighter,\nWhile the true heart fades daily,\nTrue *qi* dwindles away—\nThe vital principle of life is lost.\nIf the excessive yin-fire supplements the deficient yang-water,\nAnd after supplementing yang-water,\nStill restrains the excessive yin-fire—\nLike one drawing a bow,\nDiminishing the excessive, supplementing the deficient—\nThen yin and yang are restored.\nThis is all the natural movement of water and fire,\nThe natural interplay of yin and yang,\nAnd Heaven knows not of their doing.\nThe Way of Man is burdened by action,\nThe Way of Heaven is honored by non-action.\nWhat else is cultivation but\nReturning post-Heaven yin and yang\nTo pre-Heaven yin and yang,\nFlowing endlessly in effortless spontaneity?\n\n**Chapter 79: Receiving the Realm’s Filth**\nThe world has nothing softer or weaker than water,\nYet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the hard and strong.\nThere is no substitute for it.\nThus, the weak overcomes the strong,\nThe soft overcomes the hard—\nAll know this, yet none can practice it.\nTherefore the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the realm’s filth is to be its sovereign.\nTo bear the realm’s misfortunes is to be its king.\"*\nThis is contrary speech.\n\nThe *Taishang* chapter before spoke of the soft and weak as the source of life,\nAnd the hard and strong as the source of death.\nThus, the soft and weak occupy the high,\nThe hard and strong occupy the low—\nIt is clear that the utmost softness is the utmost strength,\nThe utmost weakness is the utmost power.\nOne must practice day and night,\nEver choosing the soft and weak as beneficial to all,\nAlways dwelling in the low and filthy without aversion.\nThough but a drop, men may scorn it.\nThough but a ladleful, men may despise it.\nYet when it accumulates into a deep pool,\nGathers into an ocean,\nIt becomes vast and boundless—\nIt can bear ships and also capsize them;\nIt can nurture life and also destroy it.\nNot only does the world have no equal,\nBut even those skilled at overcoming the hard and strong\nCannot break what is firm, cannot shatter what is strong,\nAnd none can resist it.\nThus, the world’s utmost softness\nCan govern the world’s utmost hardness;\nThe world’s utmost weakness\nCan drive the world’s utmost strength.\nWater, water!\nHow soft and weak it is,\nYet how hard and strong it becomes!\n\nMoreover, there is no task easier than attacking water,\nYet the hard and strong cannot conquer it.\nWhy then do men not embrace softness and reject hardness,\nNot choose weakness and reject strength?\nIs it not because, though they know the soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong,\nTheir innate virtue, once stirred,\nIs immediately stained by desire and habit,\nSo they bristle with arrogance,\nUnwilling to rest in softness and weakness.\nThus, cleverness grows while principle fades,\nPartiality thrives while true nature is lost.\nThe result is that the moral heart departs,\nThe human heart arises;\nForeign *qi* flourishes, true *qi* wanes.\nLife’s foundation is gone, its vitality extinguished—\nHow could one then hope for ceaseless generation?\nThe Sage says, *\"To bear the realm’s filth is to be its sovereign,\"*\nAs

      "translated_text": "Returning to reverse cultivation, one truly begins by slowly stirring the *yang* fire and *yin* talisman from the myriad forms and colors, drawing them back into the Five Bright Palaces. With the primordial *Taiyi* ancestral *qi* and the natural divine fire, one refines them—thus transforming form into a single breath.\n\nOnce this breath is refined into one, it can then be transmuted into spirit.\nIf one steadfastly guards the void and nurtures the numinous *yang*,\neven without returning to the primordial *Wuji*,\none may manifest form when exiting and leave no trace when entering.\nWhat difference does the Dao have from ordinary people?\n\nIn essence, this prenatal breath is none other than the moment when one returns to the state of *yin-yang* fusion—the original *qi* and blood of one’s parents’ union.\nIf one cultivates this prenatal breath,\nday and night with the true intent of *wuwei* (non-action) as *youwei* (action),\nand *wusi* (non-thought) as *yousi* (thought),\npreserving and gathering it,\nit will coalesce into a spiritual embryo and become the original spirit.\n\nWhen the ten months are complete and the form is whole,\nit sheds its shell and ascends through the crown,\npiercing the heavens and soaring to the celestial realm—\nriding the *luán* crane and the *hè* heron,\nsoaring among the clouds,\nwandering beyond the skies,\nand ascending to the Jade Capital—\nall in the blink of an eye.\n\nYet this prenatal breath,\nthough refined from the mortal’s colored body,\nis not the same as the vulgar *jing* and *qi* or the coarse spirit that forms it.\nThough alchemists cannot do without the postnatal, tangible *jing* and *qi* as their foundation,\nthey do not rely on them entirely.\nFor postnatal *jing* and *qi* are all substantial and bound by fate—\nsubject to birth and death, the wheel of rebirth is inevitable.\nMoreover, coarse *jing* and coarse *qi* are all dull and sluggish—\nhow could they possess any numinous essence?\nIt is only by subjecting these vulgar substances within the mortal form\nto countless refinements,\nextracting that pristine, dust-free, supremely numinous and divine *jing-qi-shén*,\nand returning it to oneself as the True One *qi*,\nthat one may forge the immortal embryo and spiritual elixir.\n\nWhat is called *\"extracting lead and adding mercury\"* is no more than this.\nAll else that clings to form and color is not the true Dao.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The embryo forms from the latent breath,\nand the breath rests within the embryo.\"*\nThus, to forge the spiritual elixir and achieve an ageless body,\none cannot do without nurturing the prenatal breath.\nTo have the prenatal breath condense within the void of the *dantian*,\none must first form the embryo—\notherwise, it will not return.\nIf even a trace of vulgar *qi* mingles in,\nor if the spirit wanders externally while the mortal mind strays,\nthe spirit will scatter and the *qi* will dissipate,\nunable to unite like parent and child, husband and wife,\ngathering without dispersing.\nDo you understand?\n\n---\n**Chapter Eighty: The Small State, the Few People**\nIn a small state with few people,\nlet there be implements of war numbering ten to a hundred,\nbut let them not be used.\nLet the people hold death in reverence\nand not wander far from home.\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nthey shall have no need to ride them.\nThough there are armor and weapons,\nthey shall have no place to display them.\nLet the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\nLet their food be simple,\ntheir clothing plain,\ntheir dwellings secure,\ntheir customs joyful.\nNeighboring states, though nearby,\nshall hear only the sounds of roosters and dogs—\nthe people shall not visit one another\nuntil they die of old age.\n\nA small state with few people,\nremote and sparsely populated,\nwould find it difficult to become a great and flourishing realm,\nor to uphold the refined customs of antiquity.\nYet if one reduces wasteful expenditures\nand simplifies elaborate rituals,\nso that implements of war numbering ten to a hundred\nare not used,\nthen consumption will be less while goods will be more—\nthe wealth of the state can thus be achieved.\nMoreover, if one does not indulge desires lightly,\nnor risk death for private gain,\nnor wander to distant lands or settle in foreign soils,\nbut instead cherishes parents and loves siblings,\nholding death in reverence and not straying far—\nthen a world of tranquility, harmony, and kinship can be attained.\n\nThus, *\"charming our sovereign, cherishing this land,\"*\nthough there are boats and carriages,\nno one will venture far to foreign lands,\nleaving their ancestral homeland.\nWhen the court’s benevolence and grace penetrate to the marrow,\nits favor as deep as that of a parent,\nits bond as close as siblings—\neven rebellious and stubborn men will be transformed into the virtuous.\nThough there are armor and weapons,\nthey shall have no place to display them.\n\nThus, with the ruler serene and the people content,\nthe people at ease and the state prosperous,\nif one restores the governance of knotted cords\nand embraces the harmony of the *Tahe*,\ncherishing kin and honoring elders,\nsettling in their homes and tending their fields,\ndelighting in their food and clothing,\nproviding secure dwellings and joyful customs,\nand fostering simplicity to shape the wind of virtue—\nwhat fear is there that the state will be small or the people few,\nor that it will be difficult to achieve greatness and abundance through benevolence and virtue?\n\nWhen the people love their ruler as they do their parents,\nand the ruler regards his people as his children and siblings,\nwith unwavering loyalty and deep affection—\neven a moment’s separation would be unbearable.\nThough neighboring states are close enough to see and hear,\nfrom youth to old age, from birth to death,\nthe people shall not once visit them.\n\nThis is because the people, moved by gratitude and transformed by virtue,\nhold their ruler in profound reverence.\nThus, they enjoy the governance of *wuwei*\nand bask in the celestial favor of the Dao,\nnever willing to stray even a step.\nHow then could the state fear being small,\nor the people fear being few?\n\nNecessarily, their influence will extend to the four quarters,\ntheir reputation spread far and wide,\nand the world will turn to benevolence,\nall nations uniting in harmony.\n\n---\nThis is an analogy for those aged and weakened in *jing* and *qi* in their cultivation.\nWhen a person grows old,\ntheir *jing* and *qi* scatter,\ntheir lead and mercury diminish—\nto practice the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir seems nearly impossible.\nYet one does not realize that the matter of the Golden Elixir\ndoes not depend on postnatal *jing* and *qi*,\nbut on the primordial lead and mercury.\nIf one attains the supreme method of the True One,\nextracting and ingesting it,\nwhether old or young,\none may obtain the medicine in an instant or half a breath,\nachieving success in a thousand years or three months.\n\nThe only misfortune is that one does not hear of the True One *qi* of the primordial,\nbut instead relies on the postnatal, tangible *jing*—\nnot only will the elderly fail to achieve anything,\nbut even the young and vigorous will never succeed.",

      "translated_text": "When cultivation reaches this stage, one is in great harmony with the Dao.\n\nSpeaking of Daoist practice, the ancients had two primary methods: those who cultivated through purity, and those who cultivated through yin-yang supplementation. Cultivation through purity means refining the void and unity—no need to refine essence or *qi*. Yet this is not for the ordinary practitioner; only those of superior root and capacity can speak of it. If one’s innate foundation is truly extraordinary, then from this single step onward, all actions align with the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth—unlike the teachings of my master today, which still involve contrivance.\n\nFor within the human body lie the mechanisms of yin-yang *kan* and *li*, *qián* and *kūn*, opening and closing, sun and moon, water and fire, ascent and descent, advance and retreat—just as the heavens move in their courses, all naturally, without need of artificial manipulation. One need only rectify the original spirit, letting it act without knowing, without thinking, without deliberation. Then the pure and empty *qi* surges boundlessly, naturally inhaling and exhaling, rising and falling like the opening and closing of *qián* and *kūn*, the movement of sun and moon, the ascent of water and descent of fire, the ebb and flow of yin and yang. Though there are stages of fire and heat, they are merely about calming the mind, reducing desires, maintaining stillness, and inner observation—letting true *qi* circulate without ceasing. Though there are advances and retreats, ascents and descents, they are merely about letting true water ascend and true fire descend.\n\nEven in alchemical bathing, it is only about restraining anger, suppressing desires, purifying thoughts, and cleansing the heart—so that the Great Harmony may dwell within. Though one may obtain elixirs and refine the pill, it is only about taking spirit as father and *qi* as mother, intertwining the two into a unified whole, merging without separation, and generating that primordial point of true essence that gave birth to Heaven and Earth—the true essence of the *li* palace, also called the true mercury of the human body. By refining my spirit-*qi* into this true mercury, a fetus forms, and later gives rise to the yang spirit, bones and flesh, blood and vessels, the five viscera and six bowels, hair and skin, clarity and awareness—none of which differ from the human form. Divided, it can manifest as myriad bodies; united, it returns to one *qi*—all arising from the union of spirit-father and *qi*-mother, their fusion forging this true mercury’s essence as the yang spirit.\n\nYet this true mercury requires the right moment to manifest. The heart governs the *qi* of the five viscera; when the central *qi* ascends, the *qi* of the five viscera ascends with it; when the central *qi* descends, the *qi* of the five viscera descends in turn. Its movement stems from the activity of true mercury; its stillness, from its repose. In essence, movement and stillness, ascent and descent—all belong to the natural Dao. One need only follow its natural operation.\n\nYet few ancient immortals began with this method. What is meant by yin-yang supplementation? First, one must recognize the foundation of the *Tàijí*, the emergence of primordial yang, and then invest this point of true yang *qi* into the *dāntián*, as if parents unite, their essence and blood merging into a cluster within the womb. This is the primordial true seed, planted in the *jiāngàn* palace of *qián*, where lead and mercury are refined daily, gradually growing until, one day, it emerges from the shell—only then does the immortal, free of the mortal form, appear. Without this true seed, one’s efforts are in vain. Though some attainment may be made, it will only preserve the physical body and never generate the transcendent form.\n\nDo you understand? With this point of true yang *qi* planted in the womb, one may then direct divine light downward. Over time, as the true yang stirs, one may draw the water of *kān* upward and guide the fire of *lí* downward, refining all the turbid yin dross and corpse-*qi* of the physical form, extracting only pure *qi* to combine with my luminous yang, merging into the pill, nourishing it into spirit—thus achieving flight and transformation. Yet even this is the natural Dao.\n\nOrdinary mortals, trapped in the post-heavenly realm, have depleted spirit and *qi*, and their years grow old. Like travelers far from home, they must return from afar—hence the need for effort. Since spirit and *qi* remain divided, unable to unite, during seated practice, one must focus intent and expend some energy, drawing both spirit and *qi* into the *dāntián*, forbidding even a thread to escape or a breath to stray. One breath in, ten breaths out; ten breaths in, a hundred out—it matters not. Thus, sealing the great gate, preserving spirit at the elixir bolt, one practices in stages. Then, when external breathing pauses, true breathing begins. Again, one nourishes it, and soon the true yang *qi* surges like wind and clouds—then one quickly opens the pass and guides it upward. Its ascent is guided by spirit, not *qi*; one need only focus the mind on the *wěilú* and proceed.\n\nWhen the true *qi* rushes forth, one nourishes it briefly before descending. In short, when true yang first stirs, some effort is required before ascent or descent becomes possible. For the turbid *qi* of the mortal form is too heavy; only vigorous agitation can dispel its filth, revealing the pure and luminous spirit-*qi* that will become the foundation of the pill. Hence the ancients said: *\"At first, one gathers the medicine—without fierce, martial fire and urgent refining, true gold cannot be extracted from the ore. This is why martial fire is called ‘wild battle.’\"*\n\nOnce ascent and descent are complete, when the *dāntián* is full and the mind at ease, one may then employ the method of refining the void, following the *qi*’s natural movements to perfect it.",

and **hòu tiān** [後天, postnatal]—this the cultivator must never fail to grasp.\n\nThe ancient scriptures say:\nThe **xiān tiān yuán shén** [先天元神, primordial prenatal spirit] is the **tǐ** [體, substance];\nThe **hòu tiān shí shén** [後天識神, postnatal awakened spirit] is the **yòng** [用, function].\nWithout the **xiān tiān yuán shén**, the Great Dao has no **zhǔ** [主, master];\nWithout the **hòu tiān shí shén**, the Great Dao lacks application.\n\nYou must diligently refine and cultivate—\nat the moment when all is **hún hún** [混混, obscure] and **duì duì** [沌沌, chaotic],\nwhen there is neither knowing nor awareness,\nyou must nurture the **xiān tiān yuán shén** to serve as sovereign.\n\nThen, with a sudden start and awakening,\nthe **hòu tiān shí shén** emerges—\nnot the fleeting,

solidify,\nand will not remain long in the **hòu tiān dǐng** [後天鼎, postnatal cauldron].\nThe moment **fán huǒ** [凡火, ordinary fire] stirs,\nit will incite **yīn gēn** [淫根, lustful roots]\nand **shēng
