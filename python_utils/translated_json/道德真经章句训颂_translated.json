  "full_translation": "**Title: *Commentary on the Chapters and Sentences of the Dao De Jing*\n**Author:** Yuan Zhen (元账嗣成, *Yuan Zhen’s posthumous name*)\n**Two volumes**\n\n**Source Text:** *Dao De Jing* (道德真经) in *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), *Dongshen* (洞神) Section, *Jue* (玉诀) Category.\n\n**Preface to the *Commentary on the Chapters and Sentences of the Dao De Jing*:**\n\nThe **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao** (太上老君) possesses the **Dao** (道) of vast profundity and the **virtue/power** (德) of boundless magnitude. He upholds simplicity while bestowing generosity, conceals the great and applies it where it seems useless, and embodies boundless action within the realm of **non-action** (无为). He transcends the **Ultimate** (太极) yet is not of antiquity, and extends beyond the **Three Realms** (三极) yet is not of the present age.\n\nThose who grasp its lofty brilliance are called **Heaven** (天), those who grasp its vast depth are called **Earth** (地). The sun and moon receive it to alternate their luminous roles, the four seasons receive it to regulate their courses, and the mountains and rivers receive it to sustain their flowing and steadfast forms.\n\nThe **great** (洪) and the **subtle** (纤), the **high** (高) and the **low** (下), the **soaring** (飞) and the **concealed** (潜), the **active** (动) and the **rooted** (植)—each attains a portion of this **Dao** (道) and thus becomes the myriad things. Among these things, the most **responsive** (灵) is **humanity** (人).\n\nThough I cannot fathom its full scope beyond its established boundaries, nor comprehend its intricacies beyond its given forms, I compel myself to name it the **Dao**. Without the **Sage** (圣人), this **Dao** would not exist; without the **Classic** (经), this **Dao** would not be transmitted. Hence, the **Dao** is difficult to hear, yet through the **Classic** it may be heard; the **Dao** is difficult to see, yet through the **Classic** it may be seen.\n\nThose who recite this **Classic**, if they gain even a thread of insight into **non-action** (无为), may thereby **cultivate their own person** (修身), **harmonize their families** (齐家), **settle the people** (安民), and **bring the world to great peace** (措天下於太平). Yet even this is but its **coarse** (粗) application.\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* (南华经) states: *\"Its dust and dross, its husks and chaff, are still sufficient to mold the worthies Yao and Shun.\"* Is this not true?\n\nAs for the **essential roots of nature** (性根) and the **foundations of life** (命蒂), their **interwoven** (交摄) and **mutually fused** (互融) essence—where **wondrous manifestation** (妙有) meets **true emptiness** (真空), and **subtle speech** (微言) reveals **profound meaning** (显说).\n\nThe lofty words in layered profundity are like solitary peaks and sheer cliffs;\nThe supreme taste in serene simplicity is like prime wine and grand broths.\nIts clarity is like flowers in a mirror’s reflection;\nIts depth is like the moon in water’s embrace.\n\nIt may be grasped in silent accord, yet not comprehended through speech;\nIt may be met with divine intuition, yet not pursued through outward traces.\nUnless one possesses a singular vision and meets Laozi in the boundless void,\nIt is difficult to even hint at its slightest essence.\n\nMy ancestor, the True Lord of Rectified Unity,\nTwice receiving divine guidance,\nDescended to the Western Shu,\nPersonally transmitting the ultimate Dao,\nUnveiling the intent beyond the Five Thousand Words—\nNo residue remains.\n\nOur lineage has guarded it for countless centuries,\nPassed down through generations like dust,\nFaithfully preserving the sacred teachings of the Most High Laozi,\nAs the foremost vow of our sect.\n\nThus, at every triennial assembly where scriptures are transmitted and blessings bestowed,\nThis Classic is expounded upon,\nSo that those in the hall and seekers of the Way may drink deeply,\nEach fulfilling their measure.\n\nYet even if one instructs ten thousand miles of people daily,\nThe time would still be insufficient.\n\nTo be a disciple of Laozi yet not know his Dao\nIs like eating full daily yet not recognizing the grains,\nOr holding a candle all night yet not knowing fire.\n\nNot only does one fail oneself,\nBut does one not deeply betray the Sage’s reverence for scripture?\n\nOut of this recklessness, I have expounded its meaning,\nSetting forth its chapters and phrases.\n\nI do not dare claim to have grasped Laozi’s intent,\nYet if my disciples and those who honor virtue and delight in the Dao\nMay ponder it and gain insight,\nThen the Elixir of Immortality need not be sought elsewhere—\nThe ultimate Dao is inherently ours.\nWhen merit is complete and practice fulfilled,\nThe Dharmakāya remains unbroken—\nThis is an inner certainty.\n\nThose who understand its meaning a thousand years hence\nShall find it as commonplace as dawn and dusk.\n\nOh, my fellow seekers—\nShould we not strive with vigor?\n\n「至治壬戌夏五月，嗣汉三十九代天师太玄子张嗣成再拜稽首谨序。」\nIn the summer fifth month of the *Zhìzhì* era (1309 CE), the 39th Heavenly Master of the Han succession, **Lord Taixuan Zhang Sicheng**, prostrates himself twice in reverence and respectfully composes this preface.\n\n---\n\n「**道德真经章句训颂卷上 嗣汉三十九代天师太玄子张嗣成训颂 道可道章第一**」\n**Commentary on the *Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, Volume One: The 39th Heavenly Master of the Han succession, Lord Taixuan Zhang Sicheng’s Explanation**\n**Chapter One: *The Dao That Can Be Spoken***\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the Eternal Dao;\nThe Name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.\n\n*The Void* is named the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\n*The One* is named the mother of all things.\n\nEver seek the Void with unwavering desire to behold its subtlety;\nEver seek the One with unwavering desire to behold its manifestation.\n\nThese two—though of one origin, yet bearing different names—\nAre both called the *Mysterious*.\n\nThe *Mysterious* again the *Mysterious*—\nThe gateway through which all subtleties arise.\n\nHow shall I constrain the Dao with rigid labels?\nSpeak of it clearly, yet it is not so.\n\nThe interplay of *Void* and *One* in their creative transformations—\nOnly through probing *principle* and *qi* is the true mechanism revealed.\n\nAh! Those who have not yet awakened to the fact that it is neither *Void* nor *One*,\nYet cling to the notion of the Eternal Dao and the Eternal Name—\nFrom such delusion, they conceive themselves, yet fail to grasp the formless essence.\n\nWhat is the Dao?\nIt is *principle* and *qi*.\n\nThe *principle* that arises from the *Void* is called *li*;\nThe *qi* that manifests in the *One* is called *qi* itself.\nWith this *principle*, the Dao is named;\nWith this *qi*, the Dao takes form.\n\nThe *principle* abides in the *Void* yet is divine,\nThus it is natural and the essence of *xìng*.\nThe *qi* abides in the *One* yet is empty,\nThus it is natural and the source of *mìng*.\n\nHeaven and Earth, all things—none can defy it.\n\nCompare it to a *tǔlǐng*—\nIts construction must follow its path.\nThus, where there is *principle*, there must be *qi*;\nWhere there is *qi*, there must be form.\n\nForm becomes Heaven and Earth, all things—\nThis is the *Dao that can be spoken*, the *Name that can be named*.\n\nYet the *principle* as *principle* and the *qi* as *qi*—\nCan they not also be spoken of and named?\n\nThus, it is neither *Void* nor *One*,\nYet the *Void* and *One* cannot be easily grasped—\nThis is the Eternal Dao, the Eternal Name.\n\nThe beginning of Heaven and Earth, when spoken of as *principle*, is the *Void*;\nThe mother of all things, when spoken of as *qi*, is the *One*.\n\nEver seek the *Void* with unwavering desire, and one attains stillness—\nThus one beholds the *principle* before its manifestation.\nEver seek the *One* with unwavering desire, and one attains responsiveness—\nThus one beholds the *qi* in its unfolding.\n\nSame origin, different names, the *Mysterious*—\nAll subtleties arise from the interplay of *principle* and *qi*,\nWith neither *Void* nor *One* to constrain them.\n\nTerms like *subtlety*, *manifestation*, and *gateway*—\nAre but guides to lead the student onward in cultivation.\n\nIn this way, when one delves deeply,\nAll myriad things, though vast in number,\nAre never separate from *principle* and *qi*, from *xìng* and *mìng*.\n\n---\n\n「**天下皆知章第二**」\n**Chapter Two: *All Under Heaven Know***\n\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—\nThen ugliness arises.\nAll know goodness as goodness—\nThen what is not good arises.\n\nThus, the *Void* and *One* give rise to each other,\nHard and soft complete one another,\nLong and short define one another,\nHigh and low balance one another,\nSounds and voices harmonize one another,\nFront and back follow one another.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in affairs of *wuwei*,\nPractices the teaching of *non-speech*.\n\nAll things arise yet he does not claim them,\nThey are born yet he does not possess them,\nHe acts yet does not rely upon it,\nWhen the task is done, he does not dwell upon it.\n\nOnly because he does not dwell upon it—\nThus it does not depart from him.\n\nEven slight deviations from the *One* harm the great harmony,\nYet no opposition exists—this is the realm of *emptiness*.\n\nWhen spring arrives, all things awaken with intent—\nWhy seek elsewhere the function of creation?\n\nAh! Now all words are utterly exhausted—\nHow shall I name this for my disciples?\n\nIf I chance to speak with Yao and Shun of the *ascendant peace*,\nIt is but a fleeting vision in dreams.\n\n---\n\n「**不尚贤章第三**」\n**Chapter Three: *Not Valuing the Virtuous***\n\nNot valuing the virtuous, the people do not contend;\nNot prizing difficult-to-obtain wealth, the people do not steal;\nNot displaying what is desirable, the hearts do not grow乱.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nEmpties the hearts, fills the bellies,\nWeakens the will, strengthens the bones.\n\nEver makes them without knowledge and without desire,\nSo that even the knowing dare not act.\n\nActing in *wuwei*,\nThen there is nothing that cannot be governed.\n\nHow does the Sage govern?\nHe simply extinguishes the impulse to create.\n\nAll people wander in their own *tian*—\nWhat have I to do with myself?\n\nAh! When hungry, one eats; when weary, one sleeps—\nAll under Heaven, originally, has no single affair.\n\n---\n\n「**道冲章第四**」\n**Chapter Four: *The Dao is Unbound***\n\nThe Dao is unbound yet used—\nSometimes it does not fill.\nDeep as the abyss, it seems the source of all things.\n\nIt blunts the sharp, resolves the tangled,\nHarmonizes the bright, aligns the dust—\nSerene, it seems as though it might yet remain.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nYet it precedes the Emperor.\n\nThe *Void* is unconstrained—\nWhere does it find obstruction?\nAll that is manifest, it contains within itself.\n\nWhen things come, do not compete with them;\nWhen affairs pass, the heart remains cool.\n\nNo place to flee from the bright moon,\nThe world vast and hazy.\n\nLeisurely, one recognizes Me—\nI am the *Emptied Sovereign*.\n\nAh! Laughable—these years gazing at shadows,\nNow, even the *water mirror* is forgotten.\n\n---\n\n「**天地不仁章第五**」\n**Chapter Five: *Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent***\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent,\nYet treat all things as *chúdòu*;\n\nThe Sage is not benevolent,\nYet treats all people as *chúdòu*.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nIs it not like a *tǔlǐng*?\n\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever emerging.\n\nMany words exhaust the meaning,\nBetter to guard the *Middle*.\n\nAll things employ and discard the *chúdòu*—\nUsed in sacrifice, then cast aside.\nYet this employing and discarding—\nIs but the fitting of the times,\nNot the Sage’s heart of preference or aversion.\n\nWhy should I burden My heart?\n\nCompare it to a single breath—\nIt seeks the wind naturally.\n\nAt the juncture of the *Void* and *emptiness*,\nHow divine is the response of *qi*!\n\nDo not weary in chewing the tongue—\nI grasp this, My true essence.\n\nAh! When one forgets the mutual reliance,\nOnly then does benevolence reach its utmost,\nThus the Sage does not act as benevolent.\n\nBecause the Sage does not act as benevolent,\nThus he can be forgotten by all.\n\nWhere he passes, transformation occurs.\nAll words, myriad teachings—\nWhich are not mere illusions?\n\n---\n「**谷神不死章第六**」\n**Chapter Six: *The Spirit of the Valley Does Not Die***\n\nThe spirit of the valley does not die,\nThis is called the *Mysterious Female*.\n\nThe *Mysterious Female*’s gateway,\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nContinuous yet ever present,\nUsed yet without depletion.\n\nStrange and wondrous—*principle* and *qi* in their forms—\nFrom *emptiness* to *reality*, they mutually generate.\n\nOriginally, Heaven and Earth are but one thing,\nEndless responses—this is My essence.\n\nAh! This is the place of My birth,\nThis is the path to the *Daoyuan*.\n\nThe *Hidden Female* transforms into the *wooden rooster*,\nWhy labor to seal the clay pot?\n\n「**谷言虚空章第六**」\n**Chapter Six: *The Valley Speaks of Emptiness***\n\nThe valley speaks of emptiness,\nFor emptiness is the *principle* of the spirit.\n\nThe *Mysterious Female* holds the *principle* of life-giving,\nThe source from which *qi* arises.\n\nCalled the *Gate*,\nIt bears the meaning of opening and closing,\nWhere yin and yang are complete.\n\nBecause there is yin and yang, there are Heaven and Earth,\nAnd all things take form accordingly.\n\nBefore their manifestation,\nThey originate from emptiness,\nThus their use is boundless.\n\n---\n\n「**天长地久章第七**」\n**Chapter Seven: *Heaven and Earth Endure***\n\nHeaven and Earth endure,\nBecause they do not generate themselves,\nThus they can endure eternally.\n\nTherefore, the Sage places his body last,\nYet his body is first;\nHe abandons his body,\nYet his body is preserved.\n\nIs this not because he has no selfishness?\nThus he fulfills his selfishness.\n\nHow can Heaven and Earth escape beginning and end,\nYet alone endure, surpassing the *Original Worker*?\n\nTo know *nature* and *command* is to prolong life for all—\nDo not say the immortals are not impartial.\n\nAh! To know *nature* and preserve the spirit,\nTo know *command* and follow *qi*,\nWithout selfishness—this is the ultimate *principle*.\n\n---\n\n「**上善若水章第八**」\n**Chapter Eight: *The Supreme Good is Like Water***\n\nThe supreme good is like water,\nFor water benefits all things without striving,\nDwelling where others scorn to be,\nThus it approaches the *Way*.\n\nIt rests in the lowly places,\nIts heart is deep,\nIts virtue is kind,\nIts words are trustworthy,\nIts governance is effective,\nIts deeds are accomplished,\nIts actions are timely.\n\nBecause it does not contend,\nIt incurs no blame.\n\nHere, softness overcomes hardness—\nThe marvel of *nature*’s use is boundless.\n\nThe jade-green pool reflects my true face,\nNo need to gaze into the boundless sea.\n\nAh! When reaching the boundless sea,\nEven greater clarity and tranquility arise,\nAll phenomena embraced in emptiness.\n\nAll under Heaven share its rain and dew,\nA single pool of sweetness endures.\n\n---\n\n「**持而盈之章第九**」\n**Chapter Nine: *Hold and Fill***\n\nHold and fill—\nIt is better to stop before fullness;\nShape and sharpen—\nIt cannot be long preserved.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them;\nRich and noble yet arrogant,\nThey invite their own ruin.\n\nWhen the deed is done,\nWhen the name is achieved,\nWithdraw—this is the *Way* of Heaven.\n\nFullness tilts, rigidity breaks—\nThe four seasons cycle as they will.\nClear moon and cool wind are true enjoyment,\nOnly then do the sages inherit their legacy.\n\nAh! Heaven warns against excess,\nHumanity values humility.\nTo attain harmony between Heaven and man,\nNo shame in the *Book of the Ramparts*.\n\n---\n\n「**载营魄章第第十**」\n**Chapter Ten: *Nurturing Essence and Soul***\n\nNurturing essence and soul, embracing unity—\nHow could it ever depart?\n\nFocusing *qi* to attain softness—\nCould one be like an infant?\n\nPurifying and gazing into the void—\nCould one remain without blemish?\n\nLoving the people, governing the state—\nCould one act without doing?\n\nHeaven’s gate opens and closes—\nCould one remain without duality?\n\nClarity and openness in all directions—\nCould one remain without knowing?\n\nNurturing yet not possessing,\nCreating yet not relying,\nNourishing yet not controlling—\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\nThe Four Great Elements coalesce,\nEntrusted to luminous clarity.\n\nPreserve it with ease,\nUnconcerned and unrestrained.\n\nWithin, what is there to see?\nThe world naturally settles.\n\nThe mechanism of entering and exiting—\nDiscerning motion and stillness.\n\nWhile others are dazzled, I am as if blind.\nNot claiming merit, not revering the sage.\n\nBody and use are natural—\nThis is true *nature* and *command*.\n\nAh! True *nature* and *command* lie here,\nUnfathomable, uncontradictable.\n\nSoul and spirit merge to form a person,\nEmbracing unity—this is guarding *nature*.\n\nWhat is meant by attaining softness, void-gazing,\nNon-action, non-duality, non-knowing, non-possession, non-reliance, non-control—\nAll speak of the *Way* of embracing unity in accordance with *nature*.\n\n---\n\n「**三十辐章第十一**」\n**Chapter Eleven: *Thirty Spokes***\n\nThirty spokes share one hub,\nYet it is the emptiness that gives the chariot its use;\nClay is shaped into vessels,\nYet it is the emptiness that gives them their function;\nDoors and windows are carved for a room,\nYet it is the emptiness that gives it its purpose.\n\nThus, having is for utility,\nEmptiness is for use.\n\nThe azure sky is vast and boundless,\nAll phenomena it contains without limit.\n\nA mere clod of earth—\nA well brings forth the spring.\n\nAh! Do not say two things are great,\nFor they exist within emptiness.\n\nWhere else could emptiness be placed?\nOriginally, it does not extend beyond oneself.\n\nEmptiness is space—\nThe chariot’s space bears loads,\nThe vessel’s space holds contents,\nThe room’s space provides dwelling.\n\nThis speaks of the boundless use of Heaven and Earth’s emptiness,\nExpanded to its utmost.\n\nAnd it says it does not extend beyond oneself—\nThe heart, contracted to its essence.\n\n---\n\n「**五色章第十二**」\n**Chapter Twelve: *The Five Colors***\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate,\nGalloping and hunting drive the mind to madness,\nRare treasures lead to erratic conduct.\n\nThus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes,\nAnd takes this while discarding that.\n\nForm is a burden to me—\nHow much more so eyes, ears, and mouth?\n\nA hollow heart and a full belly—\nThus one clarifies taking and discarding.\n\nAh! This is the path all must walk,\nConcentrating essence, refining reality in practice.\n\nWhen the belly is full and all is forgotten,\nInner and outer alike dissolve distinctions.\n\n---\n\n「**宠辱章第十三**」\n**Chapter Thirteen: *Honor and Humiliation***\n\nHonor and humiliation—like a startle,\nGreat calamity—like a personal injury.\n\nWhat is meant by honor and humiliation?\nHonor is exalted, humiliation is lowly;\nGaining it is like a startle, losing it is like a startle—\nThis is called honor and humiliation as a startle.\n\nWhat is meant by great calamity as personal injury?\nMy great calamity arises because I have a body.\nWhen I have no body, what calamity do I have?\n\nThus, to value the body for all under Heaven—\nIf one can entrust all under Heaven to the body;\nTo love the body for all under Heaven—\nIf one can commit all under Heaven to the body.\n\nHonor precedes humiliation,\nWealth precedes great calamity.\n\nWhy be startled by it?\nThis body is also external.\n\nThis can be spoken of with those who know,\nThus one values and loves oneself.\n\nAll under Heaven is a single hut,\nEntrustment may have its place.\n\nAh! This speaks of the calamity of having a body—\nWhat benefit is all under Heaven to me?\n\nIf the body is forgotten, I am forgotten;\nXú Zhōng’s wind and bottle stir no emotion—\nThis is still not forgetting the body,\nThis is still not forgetting the body.\n\n「To behold me as though I have abandoned myself—\nHow does this compare to the case of Nánguō Zǐ Qí?\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen Vision**\nWhen seen, no form is named—this is called *yí* (平易, simplicity),\nWhen heard, no sound is named—this is called *xī* (希微, subtlety),\nWhen grasped, nothing is obtained—this is called *wēi* (微妙, elusiveness).\nThese three qualities,\nCannot be summoned or questioned,\nThus they merge into one.\n\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nIts lower depths are not dim.\nBoundless yet nameless,\nIt returns to the formless void.\nThis is called the *state* of the *stateless*,\nThe *symbol* of the *formless*—\nThis is called *hūhuǎng* (惚恍, vague and indistinct).\n\nApproach it and you see not its head,\nFollow it and you see not its tail.\nHold fast to the ancient Dao,\nTo govern the present with its essence.\nTo know the ancient origins—\nThis is called the * Dao Mémò* (道冒, the Dao’s beginning).\n\nNot hearing is true hearing,\nNot seeing is true seeing.\nNo need to grasp the firewood pitchfork,\nNo need to blow—it reveals itself naturally.\n\nNo beginning means no end,\nPast and present are one thread,\nFrom it arise myriad transformations,\nYet it remains the original face.\n\nAh! Recognizing the original face,\nLifting the *zhèngfǎ gāng* (正法鋼, the iron staff of correct teaching),\nClearly it is the *Xūhuáng* (虚皇, the Void Emperor),\nBowing to the Ten Directions in surrender.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Virtue of the True Gentleman**\nThe ancient virtue of the true gentleman—\nSubtle, profound, and beyond comprehension,\nDeeply unknowable.\nBecause it is unknowable,\nHe feigns its outward form:\nLighthearted yet cautious, as if crossing a river in winter,\nSolemn yet wary, as if fearing his neighbors,\nDignified yet aloof, like a guest,\nDissolved yet clear, as if ice about to break,\nThick yet simple, like uncarved wood,\nVast yet hollow, like an empty valley,\nMuddled yet pure, like turbid water.\nWho can make turbid water still and gradually clear?\nWho can settle the restless and make it move slowly, then flourish?\nThose who preserve this Dao do not wish to be full.»\n\n「For only by not being full can one avoid constant renewal.\nIt is because of what exists within,\nThat it manifests without.\nWithout and within—what does the heart contain?\nThus, nothing remains unsolved.\nOnly by being still and waiting,\nDoes one align with movement and response.\nAh, the unpossessed is truly possessed—\nThus it remains ever-present.\nAh, ever-present yet not present,\nNot present yet unbroken,\nNeither colored nor empty,\nNeither strange nor monstrous.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Ancient Virtue of the Ultimate Void**\nTo attain the ultimate void,\nAnd steadfastly guard stillness—\nWhen all things arise together,\nI observe their return to root.\nThings teem and flourish,\nEach returning to its origin.\nReturning to origin is stillness,\nStillness is restoring vital breath.\nRestoring vital breath is constancy,\nKnowing constancy is clarity.\nTo not know constancy,\nAnd act presumptuously—\nIs perilous.\nKnowing constancy is tolerance,\nTolerance is impartiality,\nImpartiality is sovereignty,\nSovereignty is heaven,\nHeaven is Dao,\nDao is enduring,\nAnd one who abides in it faces no ruin.\nIt is said: \"No obstruction, no wind passes through,\nLeaves fall, the forest stands empty, year after year the same.\"\nThe void and stillness were once explained in ancient times,\nQi returns to the primal sea, life endless.\nAh, only the nature of qi is subtle,\nAnd I alone know stillness.\nIf a person can remain perpetually clear and still,\nAll of heaven and earth shall return to him.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sage**\nThe supreme sage—\nThe lowest knows of his existence;\nThe next, cherishes and praises him;\nThe next, fears and reviles him.\nWhen trust is insufficient,\nThere will be distrust.\nAh, how precious is his silence!\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nThe people all say, \"It was natural.\"\nIn times of harmony,\nWhen frost and snow abound,\nThe people’s joy and fear follow the seasons.\nAh, who was it that struck the earth in song?\nA thousand years have passed, yet his melody still resounds.\nAh, the qi of Yao, Shun, and Yu differed little in their splendor,\nRise and decline followed in turn—\nSuch is heaven and earth.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Decline of the Great Dao**\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned,\nThere arises benevolence and righteousness;\nWhen wisdom and intelligence emerge,\nThere arises great deceit;\nWhen the six relationships are discordant,\nThere arise filial and loving subjects;\nWhen the state is in chaos,\nThere arise loyal ministers.\nWithout the Three Sovereigns,\nWithout the Five Emperors,\nThe Three Kings do not arise,\nThe Five Hegemons do not emerge.\nNo Blind Old Man nor King Tang of Shang,\nNow is the time to observe heaven and earth’s beginning.\nAh, to observe beyond heaven and earth’s origin,\nTo perceive the wondrous before the beginning—\nOnly to find delight in wine’s essence,\nAnd not trouble the sober with its transmission.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Abandoning Wisdom**\nDiscard the sage and abandon wisdom,\nAnd the people benefit a hundredfold;\nDiscard benevolence and abandon righteousness,\nAnd the people return to filial piety and love;\nDiscard cleverness and abandon profit,\nAnd thieves and robbers vanish.\nThese three measures—\nTo use them as ornament is insufficient!\nThus, they must be relinquished.\nSeeing undyed simplicity,\nEmbracing unrefined purity,\nWith few desires and little private gain.\nThe original chaos had no seven orifices,\nYet suddenly, eagerly, they were carved for it.\nWho knows that within love, poison still breeds?\nPoison kills vital qi, yet heaven remains unaware.\nAh, the two become one, the one is split,\nThe small obstructs the great.\nOnly when the heart has attachments,\nDoes it become its own harm.\nQi moves with singular purpose,\nThe primal is without opposition.\nRetracting vision, returning hearing,\nFocuses solely on what is within me.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Ceasing Learning Brings No Worry**」\n\nThe *Yes* and the *Ah*—how far apart are they?\nThe good and the evil—how far apart are they?\n\nWhat people fear, one must not fail to fear.\nAh, its vastness knows no end!\n\nThe multitude bustles and rejoices,\nAs if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nAs if ascending the Spring Terrace.\nYet I alone stand still, unmarked by signs,\nLike an infant yet to be weaned—\nContented and drifting, as if nowhere bound.\n\nWhile others have abundance, I alone seem forsaken.\nAh, my foolish heart!\nPure and unadorned—\nWhile the common folk are bright and clear,\nI alone am dim and murky.\nWhile the common folk are sharp and discerning,\nI alone am dull and confused.\n\nSerene as the sea, yet restless as if boundless—\nWhile others have purpose, I alone seem crude and base.\nI alone differ from others, yet depend on my mother for sustenance.\n\nThe Dao is forgotten in unity, undivided.\nLike an infant, it only seeks the breast,\nLying content, drifting—what need has it of anything else?\n\nWhen strength grows long, myriad disturbances arise;\nLoss and gain within and without—\nThus, learning becomes a burden.\n\nOnly by ceasing learning am I free of burdens.\nAh, wondrous! Wondrous! Returning to the origin of heaven and earth.\nAlas, to study is to lose the true—\nThe true is already lost, yet seeking it must be done within study.\n\nBefore others, speak not of dreams as truth—\nLest you deceive the foolish into graying in vain.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Virtue of the Dao’s Form**\nThe Dao’s form follows only the Dao itself.\nThe Dao, as a thing, is only vague and indistinct.\nVague and indistinct—yet within it, there are forms;\nIndistinct and vague—yet within it, there are things.\nDeep and dark—yet within it, there is essence,\nIts essence most true—yet within it, there is verity.\nFrom ancient times to now, its name does not fade,\nTo observe the myriad things.\n\nHow do I know the myriad things are thus?\nBy this:\nOnly the void exists—\nOnly the void has spirit,\nOnly the spirit has *qi*,\nOnly the *qi* has essence.\nVoid and *qi* intermingle,\nSubstance without form—\nGrasped in stillness, wondrous transformations flow ceaselessly.\n\nAh, the three treasures—spirit, *qi*, essence—\nFrom nonexistence to existence, naturally formed.\nAll things in the world are thus—\nDo not doubt the immortals’ true renown.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Fullness of Flexibility**\nBend, and you are whole;\nTwist, and you are straight.\nHollow, and you are filled;\nWorn, and you are renewed.\nFew, and you gain;\nMany, and you are confused.\n\nThus, the sage embraces unity as the model for all under heaven.\nNot self-aware, hence clear;\nNot self-righteous, hence illustrious;\nNot self-praising, hence meritorious;\nNot self-conceited, hence enduring.\n\nOnly by not contending does one avoid contention from others.\nWas it not said that \"bend and you are whole\"?\nTruly, fullness lies in sincerity.\nSincerity alone is whole—\nWhere sincerity reaches, nothing is otherwise.\n\nThe Confucian scholars—who claims they differ?\nFor a thousand years, they have only inquired about rites.\nAh, the Non-Ultimate and the Ultimate,\nThe Nameless and the Named—\nOnly sincerity and unity hold the true void.\n\nBend and you are whole, twist and you are straight,\nHollow and you are filled, worn and you are renewed,\nFew and you gain, many and you are confused—\nNaturally, they follow one another.\n\nDarkly, the sun rises;\nClearly, the sun sets.\nSubtract, and it increases;\nHumility and honor shine forth.\n\nThis is where it returns—\nDebate is like comparing millet to husks.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Simplicity of Few Words**\nFew words, naturalness—\nThus, the gusting wind does not last a morning,\nThe sudden rain does not last a day.\n\nWho does this?\nHeaven and earth.\nEven heaven and earth cannot endure long—\nHow much less so for humans?\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao:\nThose who align with the Dao, the Dao delights in them;\nThose who align with virtue, virtue delights in them;\nThose who align with loss, loss delights in them.\n\nFaith insufficient, there is doubt.\nWhen words are natural, they are real—\nLike heaven and earth in their constancy.\nThe unnatural is neither real nor enduring—\nAll return to one hidden principle.\n\nAh, neither speech nor silence—\nIts pursuit is already exhausted.\nNeither pretense nor change—\nGusting wind, sudden rain.\nThus, they are the same in their sameness—\nWho differs in their difference?\n\nTransformation! Ah, sincerity!\nNowhere it does not reach.\nSpeak only when the time is right,\nAnd people will not weary of your words.\n\nWords are not the Dao—\nWords untimely are not trusted,\nNot trusted, not sincere,\nNot sincere, not constant.\n\nGusting wind, sudden rain—\nThe changes of heaven and earth.\nChange cannot endure long—\nSuch is the natural order.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Unsteady Do Not Stand**\nThe limping do not stand,\nThe striding do not walk,\nThe self-aware are not enlightened,\nThe self-righteous are not illustrious,\nThe self-praising have no merit,\nThe self-conceited do not endure.\n\nIn the Dao, they are called \"excess food, superfluous steps\"—\nThings may despise them, so those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.\n\nThose who strive for height do not know their feet are raised,\nThose who rush forward do not know their steps are wide.\nThose who cling to possession do not transform,\nThose who follow traces only prolong things.\n\nAh, the Dao diminishes again and again—\nWithout self, what more is there to seek?\nThe Tang and Yu had excess food,\nHeaven and earth bore a superfluous mole.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Formless Unity**\nThere was a formless unity,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\nSilent and boundless, it stands alone yet never alters,\nCircumnavigates yet never falters.\nIt may be called the Mother of Heaven and Earth.\n\nI know not its name, so I call it **Dao**,\nAnd forcefully name it **Great**.\n\nGreat passes away,\nPassing away grows distant,\nDistant returns.\n\nThus, the Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nAnd the Sovereign is also Great.\nWithin the Four Great of the realm,\nThe Sovereign holds one.\n\nHumans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows **Ziran** [自然, \"So of Itself\"].\n\nThe Dao has no fixed form—\nAh, its mystery in **Huncheng** [混成, \"Formless Unity\"]!\n\nWithin and without, Heaven and Earth,\nTransform and give birth through transformations.\n\nSeeking it, one cannot find—\nYet forcefully name it and it is named.\n\nWho can reverse it?\nThe **ling** [灵, \"spirit/soul\"] of all things.\n\nAh, the **ling** of **Ziran** [自然]—\nDo not grasp it with form!\n\nAh, to covet the peak of **Kunlun**,\nLayer upon layer, building loftier halls.\nYet right before your eyes, **Kunlun** stands—\nPointing to others, can you truly see?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Weight as Root of Lightness**\nThe weight is the root of lightness,\nThe stillness is the lord of agitation.\n\nThus the Sage moves all day yet never strays from his baggage,\nThough adorned with splendor, he dwells in serene detachment.\n\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nLighten himself upon the world?\n\nLightness brings loss of ministers,\nAgitation brings loss of subjects.\n\nAh, profound is the **Kunyuan** [坤元, \"Earthly Origin\"]—\nWeight and stillness suffice.\n\nNot to walk while walking,\nNot to dwell while dwelling,\nTo govern the world—\nThis does not exceed following Earth.\n\nAh, when spring arrives, willow fluff drifts aloft,\nOnly the east wind they say holds sway.\nYet gone, it finds no resting place—\nIn vain do Heaven and Earth stretch vast!\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Virtue of Good Conduct**\nGood conduct leaves no tracks,\nGood speech has no flaws or blemishes,\nGood calculation needs no reckoning or strategy,\nGood closure has no doors or bolts yet cannot be opened,\nGood binding has no cords or knots yet cannot be undone.\n\nThus the Sage is always good at saving others,\nAnd so there are none he discards;\nAlways good at saving things,\nAnd so there are none he casts aside.\n\nThis is called **Ximing** [袭明, \"Emulating Clarity\"].\n\nGood people are teachers for the not-good,\nNot-good people are resources for the good.\nIf one does not honor their teachers,\nDoes not cherish their resources,\nEven if wise, they are greatly confused—\nThis is called the **key mystery**.\n\nIf there is no place to apply one’s strength,\nThen there is no way to glimpse their openings;\nIf one applies their virtue,\nThen there is a way to share their gains.\n\nTo take from all is to have no bias,\nTo boast of oneself is to be ensnared.\n\nAh, the **Yuanzao** [元造, \"Original Maker\"] does not cling to form,\nWhat purpose does the Sage hold in mind?\n\nSpring’s gentle warmth, flowers in bloom,\nThe sea’s embrace, waters deep.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Masculine**\n\nKnow its masculine, hold to its feminine,\nAnd you become the **river** [溪] of the world.\n\nTo become the **river** of the world,\nOne’s constant virtue never strays—\nReturning to the **baby-child** [婴儿].\n\nKnow its white, hold to its black,\nAnd you become the **model** [式] of the world.\n\nTo become the **model** of the world,\nOne’s constant virtue never errs—\nReturning to the **Wujie** [无极, \"Formlessness\"].\n\nKnow its glory, hold to its shame,\nAnd you become the **valley** [谷] of the world.\n\nTo become the **valley** of the world,\nOne’s constant virtue is complete—\nReturning to the **Pu** [朴, \"Uncarved\"].\n\nThe **Pu** scatters and becomes vessels,\nThe Sage uses it and becomes the **officials** [官长],\nThus great measures are never cut.\n\nMy body is wondrous like the baby-child,\nHeaven and Earth are wondrous like the **Wujie** [无极],\nThe Dao’s essence is wondrous like the **Dapu** [大朴, \"Great Uncarved\"].\n\nObserve its wonder,\nAnd you know its **boundary** [徼, \"limit\"].\n\nFirm yet yielding,\nBright yet not dazzling,\nNoble yet humbly low—\nThis is to grasp its essence.\n\nAh, the **Dapu** scatters,\nHeaven and Earth become vessels.\n\nTo grasp its essence,\nTo use Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Dao originally has no form—\nForcefully calling it **Dapu** [大朴, \"Great Uncarved\"].\n\nWhat is the **Dapu** [大朴] truly like?\nWhen scattered and sought,\nThe beginning of Heaven and Earth, all things—\nYet still one sees its **unbegun wonder** [未始之妙],\nCalled the **Wujie** [无极].\n\nWhen gathered and sought,\nMy body’s birth—\nStill there remains the wonder of the yet-unborn,\nCalled the baby-child.\n\nThe baby-child is the wonder of form,\nThe **Wujie** [无极] is the wonder of no form.\n\nThus the wonder of the **Dapu** [大朴] lies between **having** and **non-having**,\nHaving yet non-having,\nNon-having yet having—\nThis is how it becomes the Dao.\n\nHumans are the **ling** [灵] of things,\nTo embody the Dao and know it—\nTo walk the Dao is to be bound by it.\n\nTo know the masculine and hold to the feminine,\nTo know the white and hold to the black,\nTo know the glory and hold to the shame—\nTo know and act upon this is the **Way** [方].\n\nTo never leave nor guard is to be complete,\nAll called **constant virtue**—\nThe Dao’s essence is the body,\nVirtue is its application.\n\nTo know this is to hold **creation** in my palm.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Approach to Taking**\n\nWhen one is about to take the world and do so,\nI see it as unavoidable.\n\nThe world is a **divine vessel** [神器],\nUnfit to be acted upon.\n\nTo act upon it is to ruin it,\nTo grasp it is to lose it.\n\nAll things either move or follow,\nEither sigh or blow,\nEither are strong or weak,\nEither bear or collapse.\n\nThus the Sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids excessiveness.\n\nTo act without acting—\nThis is how one gathers what cannot be gained;\nTo have no mind yet mind—\nThis is how one governs what leaves no trace.\n\nEven Heaven and Earth do not know my **crafting** [裁成],\nThen who knows it as the **Emperor’s power** [帝力]?\n\nAh, to grasp the world’s movement,\nTo toy with things’ transformations—\nAll is **Ziran** [自然] and natural,\nWisdom and strength are all borrowed.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao**\n\nTo assist the Sovereign with the Dao—\nNot to coerce the world with arms,\nHis undertakings are **revered** [好还, \"returned with favor\"].\n\nWhere the army encamps,\nBriars and thorns arise.\nAfter great armies,\nSurely come years of calamity.\n\nThus the good one is **firm** [果] but not arrogant,\nFirm yet not self-praising,\nFirm yet not proud,\nFirm yet not forced—\nThis is to be firm yet not coercive.\n\nThings grow old when they are strong—\nThis is called **not-Dao**,\n**Not-Dao** brings early ruin.\n\nGreat virtue is **life** [生],\nTo cease the sword is **martial** [武].\n\nOne moment’s wrongdoing\nHarms the **qi** [炁] of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAh, to do good and receive a hundred blessings,\nThe **Great God** [上帝] descends upon you.\n\nThe **fine arms** [佳兵]—\nA **disastrous** [不祥] instrument,\nThings may loathe them,\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.\n\nThe **junzi** [君子] at home values the left,\nIn war values the right.\n\nArms are a **disastrous** instrument,\nNot the tool of the **junzi** [君子],\nUsed only when there is no alternative,\nTo be **calm and simple** is the highest way.\n\n---\n\nTo conquer yet not delight in victory—\nYet those who delight in victory,\nThese are those who take pleasure in killing.\n\nThose who take pleasure in killing\nCannot fulfill their ambitions in the world.\n\nAuspicious matters honor the left,\nInauspicious matters honor the right.\n\nThe Left General takes the left,\nThe Upper General takes the right—\nThis is to treat them as funeral rites.\n\nMany killed, weep with sorrow and lament,\nVictory in war is treated as funeral rites.\n\nPrepared yet unused preserves the army intact,\nMobilized yet without battle is the highest victory,\nTo exchange positions is not what we revere,\nTo lament their deeds is to show profound warning.\n\nAh, the *Jinlu* [金箓] of Nine Truths thrice admonishes:\nCompassion and mercy, no killing—this is the true talisman.\n\n*O noble one*, do not speak of ennoblement,\nFor every triumph built on a field of bones.\n\n---\n**Chapter 32: The Dao Ever Nameless**\n\nThe Dao ever nameless,\nThough crude and small,\nThe world dares not submit to it.\n\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nAll things would come of their own accord.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nDescending sweet dew—\nNo one commands it, yet all is balanced.\n\nWhen first named, names were made.\nKnowing when to stop,\nKnowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.\n\nThe Dao in the world\nIs like rivers and valleys to the sea.\nSubtle yet honored—*li* [理],\nResponsive yet certain—*qi* [炁],\nDispersed yet named—*form* [形],\nGrasped yet unreturned—*instrument* [器].\n\nAh, emerging from the instrument,\nReturning to the void,\nEmbracing the One from all things’ beginning.\n\n---\n**Chapter 33: Knowing Others is Wisdom**\n\nKnowing others is wisdom,\nKnowing oneself is enlightenment.\nOvercoming others is strength,\nOvercoming oneself is power.\n\nKnowing contentment is wealth,\nPersistent action is will.\nUnshaken in one’s principles endures long,\nDying yet not perishing is longevity.\n\nSelf-knowledge and self-mastery hold deep virtue,\nSincere, firm, and pure—guard this center.\n\nThe nine orifices, the hundred bones—all illusory,\nNo past, no future—this is true emptiness.\n\nAh, clear in stillness,\nAt ease in constancy,\nThus one possesses one’s nature,\nNot yielding to fate’s command.\n\n---\n**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows**\n\nThe Great Dao flows—\nIt cannot be confined to left or right.\nAll things rely on it to live, yet it does not claim.\nWhen its work is done, it does not dwell upon it.\nIt clothes all things yet does not lord over them—\nThus it is ever without desire,\nAnd may be called *small* indeed;\nAll things return to it yet it does not lord over them—\nThus it may be called *great* indeed.\n\nTherefore, the sage never claims greatness,\nAnd thus achieves true greatness.\nOnly because it is unattached,\nNo one can fathom its workings.\nNo one can fathom its workings,\nThus all things cannot defy it.\nOnly those who do not claim greatness for themselves can achieve it.\n\nAh, Heaven and Earth, ten thousand things—\nOnly form obstructs.\nThe great cannot be small,\nThe small cannot be great.\n\n---\n**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**\n\nGrasp the Great Symbol,\nAnd the world will come.\nCome yet cause no harm,\nPeace and ease prevail.\nDelight and bait—\nPassing guests will stop.\n\nThe Dao spoken of—\nIts taste is insipid.\nLook upon it—insufficient to see,\nListen to it—insufficient to hear,\nUse it—never exhausted.\nMysterious symbol without form,\nMysterious delight without sound,\nMysterious bait without taste,\nMysterious use without ability—\nThey return of their own accord,\nThey complete themselves of their own accord.\n\nAh, blowing the dragon flute,\nStriking the *dù* drum.\nThe purple camel’s hump rises from the emerald pot,\nTen thousand ants, a thousand flies gather briefly.\nHow to cleanse the dust of three lifetimes?\nI give you a cup of ever-flowing water.\n\n---\n**Chapter 36: When One Would Seize**\n\nWhen one would seize it,\nFirst must one firmly release it;\nWhen one would weaken it,\nFirst must one firmly strengthen it;\nWhen one would destroy it,\nFirst must one firmly establish it;\nWhen one would take from it,\nFirst must one firmly give to it.\nThis is called *subtle clarity*.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nFish cannot escape the depths,\nThe state’s sharpest tools\nMust not be shown to others.\nOpposites give rise to each other—\nThis is the inevitable *li* [理].\nFulfill our use,\nAnd softness suffices.\n\nFish forget the depths,\nPeople forget advantage.\nForgetting yet not forgetting—\nThis is how governance is achieved.\n\nAh, humans dwell between *li* and *qi*,\nLike fish in water—\nUnaware of their being,\nLife and death in entering and exiting.\nFollow it in accordance with *li*,\nGuard it with softness of *qi*,\nTreasure the utmost within,\nHeaven and Earth in one beginning and end.\n\n---\n**Chapter 37: The Dao Ever Without Action**\n\nThe Dao ever without action yet without not acting,\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nAll things would transform of their own accord.\n\nWhen transformation stirs to act,\nI shall restrain it with the nameless crude.\nThe nameless crude—\nIt too shall not desire.\nWithout desire, in stillness,\nThe world will self-correct.\nNatural yet not forced—this is Heaven’s way,\nUniform yet not uniform—this is things’ nature.\nHold to its way,\nAttain its nature,\nAnd return to the formless form.\nSilent, vast—\nNo scent, no sound—\nWho then commands Heaven’s clarity and Earth’s peace?\n\nAh, observe water to know the Dao’s use of subtlety—\nThe waves stilled, yet wind may blow again.\nNo harm in standing quietly until it settles,\nFor then all will see its reflection.\n\nIt is said:\n\"Constant action yet without action,\nTo complete without dwelling, not to lord over, not to lead,\nSoftness, stillness,\nReturn, naturalness,\nDiminish again, diminish—\nAll these stem from one fundamental meaning,\nThe way to seek the Dao.\"\n\nThe *Daodejing*’s five thousand words\nOriginally flow as one continuous meaning,\nMaster River-Up divided them into eighty-one chapters,\nYet its intent remains inherent.\nThough some passages seem forced by analysis,\nThe reader, by seeking the whole through its divisions,\nShall naturally awaken to understanding.\n\n---\n*End of Commentary on the Chapters of the Daodejing, Volume One*\n*End of Commentary on the Chapters of the Daodejing, Volume Two*\n\nThe succession of the Thirty-Ninth Heavenly Master, Great Mystic Sage Zhang Sici, *Commentary and Praise on the Chapter of Supreme Virtue Without Virtue*, Chapter Thirty-Eight:\n\nSupreme virtue is without virtue—\nThus it has virtue.\nInferior virtue clings to virtue—\nThus it lacks virtue.\nSupreme virtue acts without action,\nYet nothing is left undone.\nInferior virtue acts and yet leaves much undone.\nSupreme benevolence acts without leaving anything undone,\nSupreme righteousness acts and yet leaves much undone.\nSupreme propriety acts, yet none respond—\nThen it forces compliance with arms outstretched.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence follows;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety follows.\nFor propriety is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nYet the first cause of chaos.\nPremeditation is the adornment of the Dao,\nYet the beginning of folly.\nThus, the noble man dwells in substance, not in ornament,\nIn reality, not in pretense—\nHence he discards the latter and takes the former.\n\nThe Imperial Way bends, the Sovereign’s virtue declines,\nKings and tyrants mix, and benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom arise in succession,\nA myriad words and thousand phrases—\nRhetoric triumphs over substance.\nYang seeks longevity, yin seeks transformation—\nClay and stone become elixirs, resembling oranges.\nThe Five Phases invert, primordial *qi* dissipates—\nAlchemists swarm with mere techniques.\nAlas! Since the world’s beginning,\nAll have been puppets of the past—\nThough each generation grows more ingenious,\nEach solution is worse than the last.\n\n*Chapter on the Ancient Attainment of Oneness*, Chapter Thirty-Nine:\n\nThose who attained Oneness in antiquity—\nHeaven attained Oneness and thus was clear,\nEarth attained Oneness and thus was tranquil,\nThe numinous attained Oneness and thus was responsive,\nThe valleys attained Oneness and thus were full,\nAll things attained Oneness and thus lived,\nThe lords and kings attained Oneness and thus ruled the world with integrity.\nYet if they lost that Oneness—\nHeaven, without clarity, would fear to fracture,\nEarth, without tranquility, would fear to erupt,\nThe numinous, without responsiveness, would fear to falter,\nThe valleys, without fullness, would fear to dry,\nAll things, without life, would fear to perish,\nThe lords and kings, without integrity, would fear to decline.\nThus, nobility finds its root in humility,\nExaltation finds its foundation in lowliness.\nHence, lords and kings call themselves \"lonely, bereaved, and unworthy\"—\nIs this not their rooting in humility?\nIs it not so?\nThus, the attainment of Oneness in numbers:\nThough ten thousand chariots gather, there is no chariot.\n\nThe jade of old was not polished bright,\nNor chiseled sharp—rough as stone.\nHeaven’s movement thrives through strength,\nEarth’s bearing thrives through stillness.\nThe numinous shifts without fixed form,\nThe valleys empty to receive their fill.\nAll things in their diversity arise naturally,\nLords and kings govern through self-restraint.\n\nPurity follows—\nDuality brings discord.\nStone cannot be jade,\nJade cannot be stone,\nYet when stone may be jade and jade may be stone—\nThis is called *full virtue*.\n\nAh! Void and *qi* clash in wondrous strangeness,\nTen thousand forms, ten thousand shapes arise without end.\nEach thing’s nature acts as it must—\nWho knows the thread that binds them all?\n\n**The Movement of the Dao’s Return (Chapter 40)**\nThe Dao’s return is movement,\nThe Dao’s use is softness.\nAll things arise from *having*,\n*Having* arises from *non-being*.\n\nStillness governs motion,\nSubstance governs function.\n*Having* and *non-being* cycle endlessly,\nLike waking after a dream.\n\nAh! *Non-being* is spirit,\nSpirit is nature,\nVoid is *qi*,\n*Qi* is life.\nMutually they embody and function,\nMotion and stillness—\nWho escapes death and severs response?\n\n**The Noble Hear the Dao (Chapter 41)**\nThe noble hear the Dao and diligently act upon it;\nThe mediocre hear the Dao and half-forget it;\nThe lowly hear the Dao and laugh—\nIf they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.\n\nThus the ancient said:\nThe bright Dao appears dim,\nAdvancing the Dao seems retreat,\nThe smooth Dao seems rough,\nHighest virtue seems a valley,\nGreat whiteness seems shame,\nAmple virtue seems lacking,\nEstablished virtue seems stolen,\nSincerity seems perverse,\nThe greatest square has no corners,\nThe greatest vessel is fashioned late,\nThe greatest sound is near-silent,\nThe greatest form is shapeless,\nThe Dao is hidden, nameless.\n\nOnly the Dao\nLends itself and completes.\nThe wise see it and grow clearer,\nThe dim see it and grow dimmer—\nPeople’s habits differ,\nYet the Dao’s essence and function are ever-present.\n\nNot prizing one’s own worth,\nNot claiming preeminence—\nOnly by yielding *having* to *non-being*\nCan one generate the vastness of Heaven and Earth,\nSurpass their enduring span.\n\nAh! The Dao is void and natural,\nYet faith and doubt alike fail to grasp it fully.\nDo not follow the habits that divide people—\nBetter to forget before laughter comes.\n\n**The Dao Generates Oneness (Chapter 42)**\nThe Dao generates Oneness,\nOneness generates Two,\nTwo generates Three,\nThree generates all things.\nAll things bear *yin* and embrace *yang*,\nTheir *qi* mingles in harmony.\nWhat men despise—\nThe lonely, bereaved, unworthy—\nAre the titles of kings and lords.\n\nThus some things are benefited by loss,\nOthers by gain.\nWhat men teach as right,\nIs also my teaching.\nThe strong and violent\nDo not meet a natural end.\nI will make this my guiding principle.\n\n*Tai Ji* by name,\nTwo *Yin-Yang* in form,\nThree *Heaven-Earth-Man* complete.\nThings move in their ranks—\nLowly in name,\nEmpty in fullness,\nThus preserving their life.\n\nAh! The numinous thrives through spirit,\nLife through *qi*—\nEmpty and yielding,\nOne may match Heaven and Earth.\n\n**The Softest in the World (Chapter 43)**\nThe softest in the world\nOvercomes the hardest in the world.\nEntering where there is no gap—\nThus the benefit of *wuwei* is great.\nTeaching without words,\nBenefiting without action—\nFew in the world attain it.\n\nWithin Heaven and Earth, *qi* swirls and condenses,\nMetals harden and dissolve.\nNo trace, no flaw—\nThings arise and form without awareness.\n\nAh! The rope saw cuts wood,\nDripping water wears stone.\nSilently know this—\nMystery aligns with nature.\n\n**Which is Dearer: Name or Body? (Chapter 44)**\nWhich is dearer: name or body?\nWhich is more: body or wealth?\nWhich is more harmful: gain or loss?\nThus excessive love brings great expenditure,\nHoarding brings great loss.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,\nKnowing limits brings no peril—\nThus one may endure.\n\nHigh renown brings slander,\nWealth invites theft—\nGain and loss cycle endlessly.\nOnly flesh and blood decay beyond repair.\nAh! The restless strive—\nWhy not turn inward?\n\nAh! The body itself is affliction,\nWhat more could one seek outside?\nRecognize the formless treasure—\nWithout the body, true freedom.\n\n**Great Achievement Seems Deficient (Chapter 45)**\nGreat achievement seems incomplete,\nYet its use is unexhausted.\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nYet its use is boundless.\nGreat straightness seems bent,\nGreat skill seems clumsy,\nGreat eloquence seems tongue-tied.\n\nFrenzy overcomes cold,\nStillness overcomes heat—\nCalm and quiet are the norm for all things.\nHeaven’s Way, Earth’s Way, Man’s Way—\nAll in their mystery rely on humility.\nCold and heat naturally alternate,\nAll things return to the void.\n\nAh! Heaven and Earth are formed,\nInner and outer—*qi*.\nGreat is its use—\nOnly emptiness suffices.\n\n**When the Dao Prevails (Chapter 46)**\nWhen the Dao prevails,\nWarhorses plow the fields.\nWhen the Dao fades,\nWarhorses breed in the wilds.\nNo greater crime than craving desire,\nNo greater calamity than insatiability,\nNo greater fault than grasping.\nThus he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\nWarhorses are worth less than dung,\nPlow oxen sing as they till—\nClothing and food, each home provides.\nBeware of greed and excess.\n\nAh! Desire’s first sprout\nGrows from not knowing when to stop.\nUnlucky to obtain—\nDisaster lurks in fear.\nThe *Loulan* horse, a thousand li of bones,\nThe *Yuntai* edict—\nToo late to lament.\n\n**Not Leaving the Door (Chapter 47)**\nNot leaving the door,\nOne knows the world.\nNot peering through the window,\nOne sees the Dao.\nThe farther one goes,\nThe less one knows.\n\nThus the sage acts without going,\nSees without looking,\nAchieves without doing.\nFollowing footprints,\nStraining the eyes—\nThings turn endlessly without end.\nAt one moment’s stillness, clarity arises naturally,\nPiercing to the marrow of all things.\n\nAh! Order and chaos, rise and fall,\nYin and yang’s shifts—\nAll gathered in the self,\nNone in contradiction.\n\nNurture *qi*, preserve spirit,\nCultivate spirit, nurture the True.\nTrue realized, the Dao is one—\nEternal spring for ten thousand ages.\n\n**Chapter 48: Daily Learning and the Dao**\nDaily learning brings daily gain,\nDaily Dao brings daily loss.\nLoss upon loss,\nUntil one reaches *wuwei*—\n*Wuwei* yet nothing remains undone.\n\nThus to take the world,\nOne must act with *wuwei*.\nWhen action arises,\nIt is insufficient to take the world.\n\nTrue learning flows naturally,\nAsking nothing, debating nothing.\nLoss without gain is futile—\nOnly gain can bring loss.\nCease not in loss,\nAnd human desires will be exhausted.\n\nAll the world’s goods,\nI take with joy.\nAh! Studying the Dao wearies the mind—already a demon’s work,\nStudying immortality or *fa*—how much more so?\nWho knows true learning is effortless?\nWhen truly learned, affairs multiply.\n\n**Chapter 49: The Sage’s Unchanging Heart**\nThe sage has no fixed heart,\nTaking the people’s heart as his own.\nThe good, I approve;\nThe unvirtuous, I also approve—\nThus virtue is complete.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nThus trust is complete.\n\nThe sage moves among the world in simplicity,\nBlending his heart with the people’s.\nAll gaze with their ears and eyes,\nThe sage treats them as children.\n\nNot clinging to this,\nThe Dao follows;\nNot dividing from that,\nVirtue is contained.\nThe people, my kin;\nAll things, my companions—\nLet their hearts return to innocence.\n\nAh! No distinctions among people and things,\nInclusive harmony, one accord.\nAll things generate and regenerate—\nTruly, the vastness of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter 50: Birth and Death**\nBirth and death—\nThirteen perish in life,\nThirteen perish in death,\nThirteen perish in life’s motion toward death.\nWhy so?\nBecause of the excess of *shēngshēng* [vital proliferation].\n\n「Thus it is said that those who skillfully cultivate life—\nThey walk upon land and do not meet rhinoceros or tiger,\nThey enter battle and are not harmed by armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,\nThe tiger has no ground to set its claws,\nWeapons have no room to hold their blades.\nWhy so?\nBecause there is no place where death may take them.\nBirth and death are the natural order,\nNot departing from the Dao’s measure—\nThirteen perish in life,\nThirteen perish in death,\nAnd thirteen more perish in life’s motion toward death.\nExceeding in the pursuit of life,\nOne falls into death’s domain—\nThus three more perish, making six in death.\nLife three, death six—\nTogether they form nine.\nNeither life nor death—\nOnly one remains.\nThis one is the *kūn* [Receptive] root,\nThis one is the *qián* [Creative] origin—\nThus preserving my spirit,\nThus gathering my *qi*.\nSpirit and *qi* void and empty,\nOne without division—\nThings and self alike vanish,\nWhat harm, what burden?\n\nAh! One and two rely upon each other yet never part,\nFollowing life and death’s numbers, hard to defy.\nNot seeking Heaven and Earth beyond my *qi*,\nWho in dreams could know if dreams are real?\nHeaven, Earth, and all things—\nWithin and without, none depart from *qi*.\n*Qi* gathers and form arises,\n*Qi* flows and life is sustained.\nWhat is called nurturing life—\nIs but following *qi*’s flow.\n\nThe Way of nurturing life—\nIf one indulges in excess, harming *qi* to bring death,\nThen three more perish, making six in death.\nLife three, death six—\nTogether they form nine.\nNeither life nor death—\nOnly one remains.\n\nAh! This is the marvel of spirit and *qi* in void and emptiness,\nForgetting life and death,\nEntering and exiting without hindrance—\nWhat need have I of external things?\n\nUnderstanding stillness,\nKnowing its source and thus attaining stillness,\nNot like counting breaths in rigid sitting,\nOr dull stupor, mistaking it for emptiness.\nIf one sits dully in emptiness,\nHow could they observe *qi*’s flow to see Heaven and Earth?\n\nYet when *yang qi* is weak,\nAnd *yin qi* is congested,\n*Yin* ever thrives,\n*Yang* ever suppressed—\nSuccess is hard,\nFailure is easy.\nDays of clarity are few,\nDays of obscurity are many—\nThus the fate of thirteen in life and six in death is manifest.\n\nNot the root of right and wrong,\nYet all stem from human affairs.\nThe *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nIn my body, not a moment ceases to flow.\nThose who nurture life must be cautious in their movements.\n\n**Chapter 51: The Dao Nourishes Life**\nThe Dao nourishes it,\nVirtue cherishes it,\nThings give it shape,\nCircumstances perfect it.\nThus all things honor the Dao and revere virtue.\nThe Dao’s honor,\nVirtue’s nobility—\nNone command them yet they act naturally.\nTherefore the Dao nourishes, cherishes, lengthens, and matures it,\nAnd sustains it with care.\nIt gives life yet does not possess it,\nActs yet does not rely on it,\nLengthens yet does not control it—\nThis is called *xián dé* [profound virtue].\n\nFormless yet honored,\nEmerging from all things—\nThis is the Dao.\nNameless yet noble,\nNurturing all beings—\nThis is virtue.\nThousands of forms, myriad states,\nGreat and small, diverse and layered—\nThese are things.\nPast and present, bending and extending, growing and waning—\nThese are circumstances.\nHonor its honor,\nRevere its nobility—\nIt applies to all without exception,\nIt pervades all without obstruction,\nYet does not know its own source—\nThis is called supreme reason.\n\nAh! The Dao nourishes, virtue cherishes—\nWhat wondrous purpose lies beyond trace?\nBetter yet, forget both honor and nobility,\nLet them be clay tiles or gold—\nIt matters not.\n\n**Chapter 52: The Origin of the World**\nThe world has an origin,\nWhich serves as the world’s mother.\nHaving obtained its mother,\nOne knows its child—\nHaving known its child,\nOne returns to guard its mother,\nAnd thus perishes not in life.\n\nSeal its *yuè* [Joy] orifice,\nClose its gates—\nA lifetime’s labor yields no fruit.\nOpen its *yuè* orifice,\nAccomplish its work—\nA lifetime’s labor brings no salvation.\n\nSeeing the small is called wisdom,\nHolding to the soft is called strength.\nUsing its radiance,\nThen returning to its source—\nNo calamity befalls the body,\nThis is called *xí cháng* [following the constant].\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth,\nBefore parents—\nThe origin, not yet an origin,\nThis is called *yī yuán* [One Origin].\nAs father and mother,\nCreation emerges from it—\nKnowing emergence yet returning to origin,\nThus the spirit is preserved whole.\n\nThe spirit whole and unadulterated,\nWisdom and radiance in unity—\nExternal thoughts do not intrude,\nInternal speech does not issue forth—\nClearly perceived,\nBlue sky, white sun—\nNo creation, no transformation,\nWhat need have I of things?\n\nKnowing the subtle and the manifest,\nKnowing the soft and the hard,\nKnowing action and concealment,\nKnowing change and constancy—\nThe sage ascends to *Dǐng Hú* [Cauldron Lake],\nThe ruler governs as *Táo Tāng* [Emperor Yao].\nAh!

The **yin body** [阴体] is **soft and weak** [柔弱], yet employs **hardness and strength** [刚强];\nthe **yang body** [阳体] is **hard and strong** [刚强], yet employs **softness and weakness** [柔弱].\n**Reversing the Five Phases** [五行颠倒] is but a **minor technique** [小技];\n**life** and **death** of **myriad things** [万物死生],\nare all under **mastery** [归掌握].\n\n**Chapter 77**\n*The Dao of Heaven*\nThe **Dao** of **Heaven** [天之道],\nis it not like **drawing a bow** [张弓]?\n\nThe **high** are **lowered** [抑],\nthe **low** are **raised** [举],\nthe **excessive** are **reduced** [损],\nthe **deficient** are **supplemented** [补].\nThe **Dao** of **Heaven** [天之道]:\n**Reduce** the excessive,\n**supplement** the deficient.\n\nThe **Dao** of **humans** [人之道] is otherwise:\n**Reduce** the deficient to **serve** the excessive.\nWho can **serve the world** [奉天下] with the excessive?\n\nOnly those who follow the **Dao** [有道者].\nThus the sage **acts** [为] yet does not **rely upon** [恃],\n**achieves** [功成] yet does not **reside in** [居].\nHis **not desiring** to be seen as **virtuous** [不欲见贤],\nwhat is the **Dao** of **Heaven** like?\n\nUsing the **bow** as an **analogy** [譬诸],\nwhen it is **fully drawn** [既张],\nit will soon **relax** [不久必弛].\nThe **high** must be **lowered** [必抑],\nthe **low** must be **raised** [必举],\nthe **excessive** must be **reduced** [必损],\nthe **deficient** must be **supplemented** [必补].\n\nUsing the bow as an analogy, all things share one principle—yet people do not follow Heaven’s way, instead acting contrary to it. Who understands this truth? This is the way of taking what is right.\n\nOnly the sage, though not yet sage, is the sage by this very means.\n\nAh! Heaven’s Dao is like the bow—relaxing after tension, the two *qi* forces cycling endlessly for whom? If one truly recognizes the mark at the center, all things and the bow alike are forgotten.\n\n**Chapter 78: The World’s Softness and Weakness**\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the hard and strong—none can replace it. Thus, the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong.\n\nAll know this, yet none can practice it. Therefore, the sage says:\n*\"Bear the nation’s filth—this is called the guardian of the ancestral altars;\nBear the nation’s misfortunes—this is called the ruler of the world.\"*\nTrue words seem contrary.\n\nHere, virtue is prized in constancy—constancy makes the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.\nTo receive filth from below and form the sea, the sea’s work lies in enduring time.\n\nAh! Water conquers with softness—who does not know? Yet none can practice it, for they cannot maintain it.\nAccumulating goodness and embracing breadth, unceasing and steadfast, virtue is complete, the Dao is fulfilled—Heaven and Earth all submit.\n\n**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Grievances**\nTo reconcile great grievances must leave lingering grievances—how can this be good? Thus, the sage holds the left contract yet does not demand repayment from others.\n\nTherefore, one with virtue oversees the contract, one without oversees the tally.\nHeaven’s Dao favors none—it always aligns with the virtuous.\nGrievances should not arise, nor should they be reconciled—reconciliation without end only deepens the calamity.\nThe origin of grievances lies with others, yet blame returns here—the analogy of holding the contract reveals the logic of retribution.\n\nWhat should be demanded is not demanded—only virtue is taken.\nOne with virtue holds virtue—this is called overseeing the contract.\n*Simpèi* (彻) means \"track\"—its cyclical meaning is illustrated by overseeing the tally, where grievances persist unchecked.\nHeaven’s Dao favors none—only the virtuous does it aid. The virtuous do not demand retribution—Heaven itself repays them.\n\nAh! All things vanish in boundless clarity—where are grievances? Where is virtue named?\nIf all were virtuous, from whence would Heaven’s aid come? In ancient times, green mountains remain green.\n\n(*Simpèi* is also written as *zhé* 辙.)\n\n**Chapter 80: Small States, Few People**\nIn small states with few people, let there be ten- or hundred-person tools yet leave them unused; let the people value death yet not flee far. Though there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them; though there are armor and weapons, they have no need to display them. Let the people return to knotted cords for record-keeping.\n\nLet them find their food sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.\nNeighboring states are visible, the sounds of roosters and dogs heard between them—yet the people die of old age without visiting one another.\nRelying on what is useless yet finding self-sufficiency in it,\nThe Dao runs parallel without contradiction, all things flourish yet each finds its place.\nTheir intentions are shared, yet their paths do not meet.\nAh! The sage’s embrace is vast—already complete in a hundred-li realm.\n\nAh! The Dao is naturally effortless, customs naturally pure—mountains, rivers, people, ancient as today.\nThe Azure Ox departs, leaving no trace—who knows the heart of its past service to the world?\n\n**Chapter 81: True Words Are Not Ornate**\nTrue words are not ornate; ornate words are not true.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\nThe sage accumulates nothing—yet the more they give to others, the more they possess; the more they bestow, the more they have.\n\nHeaven’s Dao benefits without harming;\nThe sage’s Dao acts without striving.\nBeautiful speech is flowery; true speech is plain.\nThose who argue create strife; the virtuous create no ill.\nUnity brings knowledge; multiplicity brings breadth.\nThe sage accumulates nothing—emptiness governs all, giving to others only increases their own abundance, mirroring the workings of creation, like the timing of deep springs.\n\nBenefit without harm, action without strife—this is both Heaven and humanity, one yet not two.\nAll things are as they should be; all things are complete. Great is the Dao! By it, all begins and ends.\n\nAh! Not-speech, not-Dao—Dao is not-speech, speech is not-Dao.\nWho knows the subtlety of argument and learning? The mystery is never passed on.\nHuman laws follow Heaven; Heaven follows the Dao—what does the Dao follow? It follows *ziran* (自然).\nThe *Morality and Virtue Classic* (道德真经) *Commentary and Praise* concludes here.\n\n---\n*\"Although\" and its success are one*—the word *\"although\"* (虽然) is likely superfluous.",

He upholds simplicity while bestowing generosity, conceals the great and applies it where it seems useless, and embodies boundless action within the realm of **non-action** (无为). He transcends the **Ultimate** (太极) yet is not of antiquity, and extends beyond the **Three Realms** (三极) yet is not of the present age.\n\nThose who grasp its lofty brilliance are called **Heaven** (天), those who grasp its vast depth are called **Earth** (地). The sun and moon receive it to alternate their luminous roles, the four seasons receive it to regulate their courses, and the mountains and rivers receive it to sustain their flowing and steadfast forms.\n\nThe **great** (洪) and the **subtle** (纤), the **high** (高) and the **low** (下), the **soaring** (飞) and the **concealed** (潜), the **active** (动) and the **rooted** (植)—each attains a portion of this **Dao** (道) and thus becomes the myriad things. Among these things, the most **responsive** (灵) is **humanity** (人).\n\nThough I cannot fathom its full scope beyond its established boundaries, nor comprehend its intricacies beyond its given forms, I compel myself to name it the **Dao**. Without the **Sage** (圣人), this **Dao** would not exist; without the **Classic** (经), this **Dao** would not be transmitted.

Those who have not yet awakened to the fact that it is neither *Void* nor *One*,\nYet cling to the notion of the Eternal Dao and the Eternal Name—\nFrom such delusion, they conceive themselves, yet fail to grasp the formless essence.\n\nWhat is the Dao?\nIt is *principle* and *qi*.\n\nThe *principle* that arises from the *Void* is called *li*;\nThe *qi* that manifests in the *One* is called *qi* itself.\nWith this *principle*, the Dao is named;\nWith this *qi*, the Dao takes form.\n\nThe *principle* abides in the *Void* yet is divine,\nThus it is natural and the essence of *xìng*.\nThe *qi* abides in the *One* yet is empty,\nThus it is natural and the source of *mìng*.\n\nHeaven and Earth, all things—none can defy it.\n\nCompare it to a *tǔlǐng*—\nIts construction must follow its path.\nThus, where there is *principle*, there must be *qi*;\nWhere there is *qi*, there must be form.\n\nForm becomes Heaven and Earth, all things—\nThis is the *Dao that can be spoken*, the *Name that can be named*.\n\nYet the *principle* as *principle* and the *qi* as *qi*—\nCan they not also be spoken of and named?\n\nThus, it is neither *Void* nor *One*,\nYet the *Void* and *One* cannot be easily grasped—\nThis is the Eternal Dao, the Eternal Name.\n\nThe beginning of Heaven and Earth, when spoken of as *principle*, is the *Void*;\nThe mother of all things, when spoken of as *qi*, is the *One*.\n\nEver seek the *Void* with unwavering desire, and one attains stillness—\nThus one beholds the *principle* before its manifestation.\nEver seek the *One* with unwavering desire, and one attains responsiveness—\nThus one beholds the *qi* in its unfolding.\n\nSame origin, different names, the *Mysterious*—\nAll subtleties arise from the interplay of *principle* and *qi*,\nWith neither *Void* nor *One* to constrain them.\n\nTerms like *subtlety*, *manifestation*, and *gateway*—\nAre but guides to lead the student onward in cultivation.\n\nIn this way, when one delves deeply,\nAll myriad things, though vast in number,\nAre never separate from *principle* and *qi*, from *xìng* and *mìng*.\n\n---\n\n「**天下皆知章第二**」\n**Chapter Two: *All Under Heaven Know***\n\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—\nThen ugliness arises.\nAll know goodness as goodness—\nThen what is not good arises.\n\nThus, the *Void* and *One* give rise to each other,\nHard and soft complete one another,\nLong and short define one another,\nHigh and low balance one another,\nSounds and voices harmonize one another,\nFront and back follow one another.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in affairs of *wuwei*,\nPractices the teaching of *non-speech*.\n\nAll things arise yet he does not claim them,\nThey are born yet he does not possess them,\nHe acts yet does not rely upon it,\nWhen the task is done, he does not dwell upon it.\n\nOnly because he does not dwell upon it—\nThus it does not depart from him.\n\nEven slight deviations from the *One* harm the great harmony,\nYet no opposition exists—this is the realm of *emptiness*.\n\nWhen spring arrives, all things awaken with intent—\nWhy seek elsewhere the function of creation?\n\nAh! Now all words are utterly exhausted—\nHow shall I name this for my disciples?\n\nIf I chance to speak with Yao and Shun of the *ascendant peace*,\nIt is but a fleeting vision in dreams.\n\n---\n\n「**不尚贤章第三**」\n**Chapter Three: *Not Valuing the Virtuous***\n\nNot valuing the virtuous, the people do not contend;\nNot prizing difficult-to-obtain wealth, the people do not steal;\nNot displaying what is desirable, the hearts do not grow乱.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nEmpties the hearts, fills the bellies,\nWeakens the will, strengthens the bones.\n\nEver makes them without knowledge and without desire,\nSo that even the knowing dare not act.\n\nActing in *wuwei*,\nThen there is nothing that cannot be governed.\n\nHow does the Sage govern?\nHe simply extinguishes the impulse to create.\n\nAll people wander in their own *tian*—\nWhat have I to do with myself?\n\nAh! When hungry, one eats; when weary, one sleeps—\nAll under Heaven, originally, has no single affair.\n\n---\n\n「**道冲章第四**」\n**Chapter Four: *The Dao is Unbound***\n\nThe Dao is unbound yet used—\nSometimes it does not fill.\nDeep as the abyss, it seems the source of all things.\n\nIt blunts the sharp, resolves the tangled,\nHarmonizes the bright, aligns the dust—\nSerene, it seems as though it might yet remain.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nYet it precedes the Emperor.\n\nThe *Void* is unconstrained—\nWhere does it find obstruction?\nAll that is manifest, it contains within itself.\n\nWhen things come, do not compete with them;\nWhen affairs pass, the heart remains cool.\n\nNo place to flee from the bright moon,\nThe world vast and hazy.\n\nLeisurely, one recognizes Me—\nI am the *Emptied Sovereign*.\n\nAh! Laughable—these years gazing at shadows,\nNow, even the *water mirror* is forgotten.\n\n---\n\n「**天地不仁章第五**」\n**Chapter Five: *Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent***\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent,\nYet treat all things as *chúdòu*;\n\nThe Sage is not benevolent,\nYet treats all people as *chúdòu*.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nIs it not like a *tǔlǐng*?\n\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever emerging.\n\nMany words exhaust the meaning,\nBetter to guard the *Middle*.\n\nAll things employ and discard the *chúdòu*—\nUsed in sacrifice, then cast aside.\nYet this employing and discarding—\nIs but the fitting of the times,\nNot the Sage’s heart of preference or aversion.\n\nWhy should I burden My heart?\n\nCompare it to a single breath—\nIt seeks the wind naturally.\n\nAt the juncture of the *Void* and *emptiness*,\nHow divine is the response of *qi*!\n\nDo not weary in chewing the tongue—\nI grasp this, My true essence.\n\nAh! When one forgets the mutual reliance,\nOnly then does benevolence reach its utmost,\nThus the Sage does not act as benevolent.\n\nBecause the Sage does not act as benevolent,\nThus he can be forgotten by all.\n\nWhere he passes, transformation occurs.\nAll words, myriad teachings—\nWhich are not mere illusions?\n\n---\n「**谷神不死章第六**」\n**Chapter Six: *The Spirit of the Valley Does Not Die***\n\nThe spirit of the valley does not die,\nThis is called the *Mysterious Female*.\n\nThe *Mysterious Female*’s gateway,\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nContinuous yet ever present,\nUsed yet without depletion.\n\nStrange and wondrous—*principle* and *qi* in their forms—\nFrom *emptiness* to *reality*, they mutually generate.\n\nOriginally, Heaven and Earth are but one thing,\nEndless responses—this is My essence.\n\nAh! This is the place of My birth,\nThis is the path to the *Daoyuan*.\n\nThe *Hidden Female* transforms into the *wooden rooster*,\nWhy labor to seal the clay pot?",

gains.\n\nTo take from all is to have no bias,\nTo boast of oneself is to be ensnared.\n\nAh, the **Yuanzao** [元造, \"Original Maker\"] does not cling to form,\nWhat purpose does the Sage hold in mind?\n\nSpring’s gentle warmth, flowers in bloom,\nThe sea’s embrace, waters deep.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Masculine**\n\nKnow its masculine, hold to its feminine,\nAnd you become the **river** [溪] of the world.\n\nTo become the **river** of the world,\nOne’s constant virtue never strays—\nReturning to the **baby-child** [婴儿].\n\nKnow its white, hold to its black,\nAnd you become the **model** [式] of the world.\n\nTo become the **model** of the world,\nOne’s constant virtue never errs—\nReturning to the **Wujie** [无极, \"Formlessness\"].\n\nKnow its glory, hold to its shame,\nAnd you become the **valley** [谷] of the world.\n\nTo become the **valley** of the world,\nOne’s constant virtue is complete—\nReturning to the **Pu** [朴, \"Uncarved\"].\n\nThe **Pu** scatters and becomes vessels,\nThe Sage uses it and becomes the **officials** [官长],\nThus great measures are never cut.\n\nMy body is wondrous like the baby-child,\nHeaven and Earth are wondrous like the **Wujie** [无极],\nThe Dao’s essence is wondrous like the **Dapu** [大朴, \"Great Uncarved\"].\n\nObserve its wonder,\nAnd you know its **boundary** [徼, \"limit\"].\n\nFirm yet yielding,\nBright yet not dazzling,\nNoble yet humbly low—\nThis is to grasp its essence.\n\nAh, the **Dapu** scatters,\nHeaven and Earth become vessels.\n\nTo grasp its essence,\nTo use Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Dao originally has no form—\nForcefully calling it **Dapu** [大朴, \"Great Uncarved\"].\n\nWhat is the **Dapu** [大朴] truly like?\nWhen scattered and sought,\nThe beginning of Heaven and Earth, all things—\nYet still one sees its **unbegun wonder** [未始之妙],\nCalled the **Wujie** [无极].\n\nWhen gathered and sought,\nMy body’s birth—\nStill there remains the wonder of the yet-unborn,\nCalled the baby-child.\n\nThe baby-child is the wonder of form,\nThe **Wujie** [无极] is the wonder of no form.\n\nThus the wonder of the **Dapu** [大朴] lies between **having** and **non-having**,\nHaving yet non-having,\nNon-having yet having—\nThis is how it becomes the Dao.\n\nHumans are the **ling** [灵] of things,\nTo embody the Dao and know it—\nTo walk the Dao is to be bound by it.\n\nTo know the masculine and hold to the feminine,\nTo know the white and hold to the black,\nTo know the glory and hold to the shame—\nTo know and act upon this is the **Way** [方].\n\nTo never leave nor guard is to be complete,\nAll called **constant virtue**—\nThe Dao’s essence is the body,\nVirtue is its application.\n\nTo know this is to hold **creation** in my palm.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Approach to Taking**\n\nWhen one is about to take the world and do so,\nI see it as unavoidable.\n\nThe world is a **divine vessel** [神器],\nUnfit to be acted upon.\n\nTo act upon it is to ruin it,\nTo grasp it is to lose it.\n\nAll things either move or follow,\nEither sigh or blow,\nEither are strong or weak,\nEither bear or collapse.\n\nThus the Sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids excessiveness.\n\nTo act without acting—\nThis is how one gathers what cannot be gained;\nTo have no mind yet mind—\nThis is how one governs what leaves no trace.\n\nEven Heaven and Earth do not know my **crafting** [裁成],\nThen who knows it as the **Emperor’s power** [帝力]?\n\nAh, to grasp the world’s movement,\nTo toy with things’ transformations—\nAll is **Ziran** [自然] and natural,\nWisdom and strength are all borrowed.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao**\n\nTo assist the Sovereign with the Dao—\nNot to coerce the world with arms,\nHis undertakings are **revered** [好还, \"returned with favor\"].\n\nWhere the army encamps,\nBriars and thorns arise.\nAfter great armies,\nSurely come years of calamity.\n\nThus the good one is **firm** [果] but not arrogant,\nFirm yet not self-praising,\nFirm yet not proud,\nFirm yet not forced—\nThis is to be firm yet not coercive.\n\nThings grow old when they are strong—\nThis is called **not-Dao**,\n**Not-Dao** brings early ruin.\n\nGreat virtue is **life** [生],\nTo cease the sword is **martial** [武].\n\nOne moment’s wrongdoing\nHarms the **qi** [炁] of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAh, to do good and receive a hundred blessings,\nThe **Great God** [上帝] descends upon you.\n\nThe **fine arms** [佳兵]—\nA **disastrous** [不祥] instrument,\nThings may loathe them,\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.\n\nThe **junzi** [君子] at home values the left,\nIn war values the right.\n\nArms are a **disastrous** instrument,\nNot the tool of the **junzi** [君子],\nUsed only when there is no

is the highest victory,\nTo exchange positions is not what we revere,\nTo lament their deeds is to show profound warning.\n\nAh, the *Jinlu* [金箓] of Nine Truths thrice admonishes:\nCompassion and mercy, no killing—this is the true talisman.\n\n*O noble one*, do not speak of ennoblement,\nFor every triumph built on a field of bones.\n\n---\n**Chapter 32: The Dao Ever Nameless**\n\nThe Dao ever

enlightenment.\nOvercoming others is strength,\nOvercoming oneself is power.\n\nKnowing contentment is wealth,\nPersistent action is will.\nUnshaken in one’s principles endures long,\nDying yet not perishing is longevity.\n\nSelf-knowledge and self-mastery hold deep virtue,\nSincere, firm, and pure—guard this center.\n\nThe nine orifices, the hundred bones—all illusory,\nNo past, no future—this is true emptiness.\n\nAh, clear in stillness,\nAt ease in constancy,\nThus one possesses one’s nature,\nNot yielding to fate’s command.\n\n---\n**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows**\n\nThe Great Dao flows—\nIt cannot be confined to left or right.\nAll things rely on it to live, yet it does not claim.\nWhen its work is done, it does not dwell upon it.\nIt clothes all things yet does not lord over them—\nThus it is ever without desire,\nAnd may be called *small* indeed;\nAll things return to it yet it does not lord over them—\nThus it may be called *great* indeed.\n\nTherefore, the sage never claims greatness,\nAnd thus achieves true greatness.\nOnly because it is unattached,\nNo one can fathom its workings.\nNo one can fathom its workings,\nThus all things cannot defy it.\nOnly those who do not claim greatness for themselves can achieve it.\n\nAh, Heaven and Earth, ten thousand things—\nOnly form obstructs.\nThe great cannot be small,\nThe small cannot be great.\n\n---\n**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**\n\nGrasp the Great Symbol,\nAnd the world will come.\nCome yet cause no harm,\nPeace and ease prevail.\nDelight and bait—\nPassing guests will stop.\n\nThe Dao spoken of—\nIts taste is insipid.\nLook upon it—insufficient to see,\nListen to it—insufficient to hear,\nUse it—never exhausted.\nMysterious symbol without form,\nMysterious delight without sound,\nMysterious bait without taste,\nMysterious use without ability—\nThey return of their own accord,\nThey complete themselves of their own accord.\n\nAh, blowing the dragon flute,\nStriking the *dù* drum.\nThe purple camel’s hump rises from the emerald pot,\nTen thousand ants, a thousand flies gather briefly.\nHow to cleanse the dust of three lifetimes?\nI give you a cup of ever-flowing water.\n\n---\n**Chapter 36: When One Would Seize**\n\nWhen one would seize it,\nFirst must one firmly release it;\nWhen one would weaken it,\nFirst must one firmly strengthen it;\nWhen one would destroy it,\nFirst must one firmly establish it;\nWhen one would take from it,\nFirst must one firmly give to it.\nThis is called *subtle clarity*.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nFish cannot escape the depths,\nThe state’s sharpest tools\nMust not be shown to others.\nOpposites give rise to each other—\nThis is the inevitable *li* [理].\nFulfill our use,\nAnd softness suffices.\n\nFish forget the depths,\nPeople forget advantage.\nForgetting yet not forgetting—\nThis is how governance is achieved.\n\nAh, humans dwell between *li* and *qi*,\nLike fish in water—\nUnaware of their being,\nLife and death in entering and exiting.\nFollow it in accordance with *li*,\nGuard it with softness of *qi*,\nTreasure the utmost within,\nHeaven and Earth in one beginning and end.\n\n---\n**Chapter 37: The Dao Ever Without Action**\n\nThe Dao ever without action yet without not acting,\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nAll things would transform of their

quietly until it settles,\nFor then all will see its reflection.\n\nIt is said:\n\"Constant action yet without action,\nTo complete without dwelling, not to lord over, not to lead,\nSoftness,

I have lost myself—\nwhat is true gain or loss?\n\n*On Ease and Simplicity, Chapter 64*\nIts ease is simple to uphold,\nits unseen signs are simple to plan,\nits fragility is simple to float away,\nits subtlety is simple to disperse.\n\nAct before it exists,\norder before it is disordered.\nA tree of ten arms begins from a tiny sprout;\na nine-tiered tower rises from piled earth;\na journey of a thousand *lǐ* begins beneath one’s feet.\n\nThe doer brings ruin,\nthe clinger loses hold.\nThe Sage acts without acting,\nand so knows no ruin;\nholds without clinging,\nand so suffers no loss.\n\nWhen the people undertake affairs,\nthey often falter just as completion nears.\nIf you guard the end as you guard the beginning,\nthere will be no ruined undertakings.\n\nThus the Sage desires without desiring,\ndoes not prize hard-to-obtain goods;\nlearns without learning,\ncorrects the errors of the common people,\nto assist the natural unfolding of all things—\nand never dares to act.\n\nSeeing the world’s *few* (precursors) and then acting,\nto fulfill the world’s tasks;\nknowing the world’s *wēi* (subtleties) and then acting,\nto dissipate the world’s transformations.\n\nThere are gains and losses that can be weighed before the *few* (precursors),\nand wisdom insufficient to reveal the *wēi* (subtleties).\nTherefore, guard the end as you guard the beginning—\nabandon this, take that—\nso that you may assist the natural creation of all things\nand follow the principles of **Dao/Way**.\n\nAh! Seek your cloak before the snow and frost arrive,\na woodworm can still bore through stone.\nAct without scheming and still find fulfillment,\nadding legs to a snake only brings misfortune.\n\n*Ancient Masters Skilled in the Dao, Chapter 65*\nThe ancients skilled in the Dao\ndid not seek to enlighten the people,\nbut rather to befuddle them.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern,\nbecause their cleverness is too great.\nTo govern with cleverness is to harm the state,\nto govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing.\n\nKnowing these two principles is the **kǎishì** (standard/criterion).\nThe one who can know the **kǎishì** (standard/criterion)\nis said to possess **Xuándé** (Mysterious Virtue).\n\n**Xuándé** (Mysterious Virtue) is profound and distant,\ncontrary to things—\nonly then does one reach the **great order**.\n\nCleverness flows like water,\nfoolishness nears the true.\n\nLend them their own harm,\nand they will harm others.\n\nThe true returns to simplicity,\nand the people transform with purity.\n\nThus, when the standard is taken,\nthe world returns to **rén** (benevolence).\n\nAh! Qin ruled with cleverness to fool the masses,\nyet did not know the masses fooled Qin.\nIf you grasp the truth of foolishness,\nask Han Wen of old.\n\n*Jiānghǎi as the Sovereign of All Valleys, Chapter 66*\nJiānghǎi (the sea) can be sovereign of all valleys,\nbecause it excels in yielding to them,\nand so becomes their master.\n\nThus the Sage, wishing to lead the people,\nmust speak in terms of yielding to them;\nwishing to serve the people,\nmust place himself behind them.\n\nThus the Sage stands above yet the people do not feel burdened,\nleads yet the people do not suffer harm,\nand so the world gladly follows and does not weary.\n\nBecause he does not contend,\nthe world cannot contend with him.\n\nNo humility compares to the sea,\nand all waters flow toward it;\nno self-subtraction compares to the Sage,\nand all the people return to him.\n\nWaters flow toward it and so exhaust the earth’s advantages,\nthe people return to it and so harness the times of Heaven—\nthus humility is the foundation of exaltation,\nand self-subtraction is the root of enrichment.\nThese are all hidden in their *wu* (non-being),\nwho can know their purpose?\n\nAh! The Dao of **humble yet exalted, subtract yet enrich**—\nobserve the sea to understand the **creative principle**.\n\nLook now at the Milky Way in the sky,\nits tail has never known a reverse flow.\n\n*The World Speaks of the Dao, Chapter 67*\nThe world speaks of my Dao as vast,\nyet it seems unlike.\n\nOnly because it is vast does it seem unlike.\nIf it were like, it would have long been trivial.\n\nI hold three treasures,\nprotecting and upholding them.\nThe first is **cí** (compassion),\nthe second is **jiǎn** (frugality),\nthe third is *not daring to lead the world*.\n\n**Cí** (compassion) brings courage,\n**jiǎn** (frugality) brings abundance,\nnot daring to lead the world\nbrings completion and longevity.\n\nNow abandon **cí** for courage,\nabandon **jiǎn** for abundance,\nabandon humility for precedence—\ndeath will follow.\n\n**Cí** (compassion) in battle ensures victory,\n**cí** (compassion) in defense ensures stability.\nWhen Heaven would rescue someone,\nit shields them with **cí** (compassion).\n\nThe Dao is vast without form—\nif it takes form, it becomes small.\n\nOnly these three treasures can govern the world.\n**Cí** (compassion) sustains life,\n**jiǎn** (frugality) enriches the people,\nnot daring to lead\npreserves enduring peace.\n\nOnly by guarding and remaining tranquil\ncan one achieve lasting completion.\n\nAbundance aids mutual support,\ncourage drives righteousness—\nabandon these to take others,\nbeware, lest death ensue.\nReturn to them, and you will attain eternal life.\n\nThe Dao has no favorites,\nit rewards only the **good**.\n\nAh! These three treasures are shared by all—\nhaving them depends on the person.\n\nHow else guard the **qi**?\nHow else conserve the **jīng** (essence)?\nDisturbing and striving to lead,\nhow can one preserve one’s **shén** (spirit)?\n\n**Shén** (spirit) preserved, **jīng** (essence) and **qi** harmonized—\nenduring and tranquil, let no emotions stir.\n\nNeither contend nor defend—\nnaturally, my true self is fulfilled.\n\n*On the Virtuous Scholar, Chapter 68*\nThe virtuous scholar is not martial,\nthe skilled warrior does not rage,\nthe conqueror of enemies does not contend,\nthe master of people places himself beneath them.",

      "translated_text": "Using the bow as an analogy, all things share one principle—yet people do not follow Heaven’s way, instead acting contrary to it. Who understands this truth? This is the way of taking what is right.\n\nOnly the sage, though not yet sage, is the sage by this very means.\n\nAh! Heaven’s Dao is like the bow—relaxing after tension, the two *qi* forces cycling endlessly for whom? If one truly recognizes the mark at the center, all things and the bow alike are forgotten.\n\n**Chapter 78: The World’s Softness and Weakness**\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the hard and strong—none can replace it. Thus, the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong.\n\nAll know this, yet none can practice it. Therefore, the sage says:\n*\"Bear the nation’s filth—this is called the guardian of the ancestral altars;\nBear the nation’s misfortunes—this is called the ruler of the world.\"*\nTrue words seem contrary.\n\nHere, virtue is prized in constancy—constancy makes the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.\nTo receive filth from below and form the sea, the sea’s work lies in enduring time.\n\nAh! Water conquers with softness—who does not know? Yet none can practice it, for they cannot maintain it.\nAccumulating goodness and embracing breadth, unceasing and steadfast, virtue is complete, the Dao is fulfilled—Heaven and Earth all submit.\n\n**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Grievances**\nTo reconcile great grievances must leave lingering grievances—how can this be good? Thus, the sage holds the left contract yet does not demand repayment from others.\n\nTherefore, one with virtue oversees the contract, one without oversees the tally.\nHeaven’s Dao favors none—it always aligns with the virtuous.\nGrievances should not arise, nor should they be reconciled—reconciliation without end only deepens the calamity.\nThe origin of grievances lies with others, yet blame returns here—the analogy of holding the contract reveals the logic of retribution.\n\nWhat should be demanded is not demanded—only virtue is taken.\nOne with virtue holds virtue—this is called overseeing the contract.\n*Simpèi* (彻) means \"track\"—its cyclical meaning is illustrated by overseeing the tally, where grievances persist unchecked.\nHeaven’s Dao favors none—only the virtuous does it aid. The virtuous do not demand retribution—Heaven itself repays them.\n\nAh! All things vanish in boundless clarity—where are grievances? Where is virtue named?\nIf all were virtuous, from whence would Heaven’s aid come? In ancient times, green mountains remain green.\n\n(*Simpèi* is also written as *zhé* 辙.)\n\n**Chapter 80: Small States, Few People**\nIn small states with few people, let there be ten- or hundred-person tools yet leave them unused; let the people value death yet not flee far. Though there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them; though there are armor and weapons, they have no need to display them. Let the people return to knotted cords for record-keeping.\n\nLet them find their food sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.\nNeighboring states are visible, the sounds of roosters and dogs heard between them—yet the people die of old age without visiting one another.\nRelying on what is useless yet finding self-sufficiency in it,\nThe Dao runs parallel without contradiction, all things flourish yet each finds its place.\nTheir intentions are shared, yet their paths do not meet.\nAh! The sage’s embrace is vast—already complete in a hundred-li realm.\n\nAh! The Dao is naturally effortless, customs naturally pure—mountains, rivers, people, ancient as today.\nThe Azure Ox departs, leaving no trace—who knows the heart of its past service to the world?\n\n**Chapter 81: True Words Are Not Ornate**\nTrue words are not ornate; ornate words are not true.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\nThe sage accumulates nothing—yet the more they give to others, the more they possess; the more they bestow, the more they have.\n\nHeaven’s Dao benefits without harming;\nThe sage’s Dao acts without striving.\nBeautiful speech is flowery; true speech is plain.\nThose who argue create strife; the virtuous create no ill.\nUnity brings knowledge; multiplicity brings breadth.\nThe sage accumulates nothing—emptiness governs all, giving to others only increases their own abundance, mirroring the workings of creation, like the timing of deep springs.\n\nBenefit without harm, action without strife—this is both Heaven and humanity, one yet not two.\nAll things are as they should be; all things are complete. Great is the Dao! By it, all begins and ends.\n\nAh! Not-speech, not-Dao—Dao is not-speech, speech is not-Dao.\nWho knows the subtlety of argument and learning? The mystery is never passed on.\nHuman laws follow Heaven; Heaven follows the Dao—what does the Dao follow? It follows *ziran* (自然).\nThe *Morality and Virtue Classic* (道德真经) *Commentary and Praise* concludes here.\n\n---\n*\"Although\" and its success are one*—the word *\"although\"* (虽然) is likely superfluous.",
