  "full_translation": "**The Authentic Scripture of the Life-Nurturing Mechanism and Golden Elixir**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Authentic Scripture of the Life-Nurturing Mechanism and Golden Elixir*\nOne scroll, unattributed; likely composed during the Northern Song dynasty.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Category of Miscellaneous Arts*.\n\n---\n\n**The Authentic Scripture of the Life-Nurturing Mechanism and Golden Elixir**\n\n**First Mechanism: The Primordial Lock**\nWithin the Primordial Lock, Heaven and Earth are born, the Qian and Kun, the sun and moon, and the stars are transformed. This is the Dark Abyss of the Primal Source, where purity and turbidity, black and white, become one. From black arises white, and from turbidity emerges clarity. Clarity is yang, Heaven, and life; turbidity is yin, Earth, and nature. From the One arises the Two, then the harmonious Center, which is the true black. This is the root of human existence: from black blood is born, blood transforms into essence, and essence circulates through the black, giving rise to *ying* and *wei*. When *ying* and *wei* intermingle, one enters the true Dao. Their stem converges into the One.\n\n**Second Mechanism: The Embryonic Sphere**\nThe second mechanism is called the Embryonic Sphere, resembling a hen’s egg, connected above by the stem. Atop the stem are two fine threads, as slender as silk: the left governs essence, the right governs urine. Life is prolonged through the black, which draws essence to form marrow. Marrow transforms into flesh and skin: flesh becomes fat, skin becomes blood; fat is black and fluid, while blood forms saliva. When saliva enters the *Weilü* (Tail Gate), there are three apertures: the left draws essence, the right draws blood, and the center circulates the black. Essence draws blood, and blood refines into essence. Essence is the foundation of human life and nature. As the *Yinfu Jing* states: \"When the Three Thieves are harmonized, the Three Powers are at peace.\"\n\n**Third Mechanism: The Upper Palace**\nThe Upper Palace is the Gate of the Brain Spirit, where the fluid is refined and swallowed. Beneath the tongue lie three apertures, corresponding below to the *Weilü* Gate. The left is called the Solar Soul, the Metal Gate; the right is called the Lunar Spirit, the Jade Portal; the center is named the Jade Spring, the gateway where the ten thousand spirits converge—this is the Jade Gate. When the Jade Gate is moist, the black flows and circulates; when it is dry, the body withers and decays. The essential technique of cultivation lies in refining, swallowing, and guiding the fluid to the lower source, where it transforms into Golden Fluid, then generates blood, and blood refines into essence, allowing the black to flow smoothly. Rotating left and right, it enters the Primordial Lock. From the Primordial Lock, it returns, passing through the *Weilü* to gather at the Dark Palace.\n\n**Fourth Mechanism: The Dark Palace and the Yellow Court**\nBefore the Dark Palace lies the Yellow Court. Essence, black, and blood circulate from the kidneys to the navel. The navel is the courtyard where the ten thousand spirits gather. Essence, black, and blood ascend from the *Weilü* Gate, first turning left to pay homage to the Yellow Prime Lord, the ancestor of Wood, thus forming lead.\n\n**Fifth Mechanism: The Return to the Dark Palace**\nFrom the Yellow Court, it rotates right and returns to the Dark Palace, entering the Central Dark Court. There, essence, black, and blood unite with Earth, merging into the One—this is called the *Primordial Black*. It occupies the position of the *First Nine*, giving rise to the Four Blacks, which are named lead. Lead is the yang within yin; the outer black is tin, the white is gold—this is the gold within water.\n\n**Sixth Mechanism: The Ascent of Lead-Gold**\nThe gold within lead ascends in reverse from the Dark Court. The Dark Court corresponds to the North, thus called the *Kan Male*. Gradually reversing its course, it ascends to Kunlun. At the nape lies the Golden Lock Gate; if not yet opened, one must sway and shake until the two leaves of the Golden Lock Gate part, allowing homage to the White Prime Lord. The gold within lead then transforms into true essence, called the *hun*—the black within Wood. This black passes through the Central Pool, entering the yin position, and becomes mercury.\n\n**Seventh Mechanism: The Transformation into Mercury**\nWhen lead enters the Central Pool, it transforms into mercury. The Central Pool is the *Niwan* (Muddy Pellet), wherein resides the spirit called the White Prime Lord, the spirit of the brain’s marrow. Lead is the *hun*; the white gold within lead is called the *Cinnabar Child*. The *Cinnabar Child* is the grandchild of Wood and the child of Fire, the yin within yang. From cinnabar emerges quicksilver, hence the name *Cinnabar Child*. The *Cinnabar Child* is the Old Woman, also the Lunar Spirit—the black of Water, thus revealing the Two Modes.\n\n**Eighth Mechanism: The Circulation of Mercury**\nMercury flows and circulates from the Central Pool of *Niwan*, soaring and descending like the true black of Water, its number being three. Thin as mist, it ascends Kunlun and enters the *Anou* Pool, where it circulates. The *Anou* Pool is called the Purple Tenuity Palace, within which dwells the spirit known as the Lord of Kunlun. The Purple Cloud Lord is the master of the hundred spirits. Lead and mercury become the left sun and right moon, circulating day and night, illuminating the Grotto Chamber. From the front, this is the number five of Wood.\n\n**Ninth Mechanism: The Perfection of Wood’s True Black**\nWhen Wood’s true black is complete, it becomes Solar Crystal, aligning with the *Jia* position. Internally, it sustains the liver, ruling in the *yin* (Tiger) hour, rotating left to arrive at the Dark Obscurity. One *cun* above the brows lies the Dark Obscurity Grotto Chamber—this is the pure yang black, now manifesting in azure hue, like a wheel covering the crown. It resembles a radiant purple mist, making the hair lustrous as if freshly washed. This is the *Weilü* Gate, circulating through the left path and returning to Kunlun.\n\n**Tenth Mechanism: The Perfection of Water’s True Black**\nWhen Water’s true black is complete, it becomes Lunar Radiance, aligning with the *Geng* position. Internally, it sustains the lungs, ruling in the *shen* (Monkey) hour, rotating right to arrive at the Dark Obscurity. One *cun* and two *fen* between the brows is called the Jade Chamber, where the pure yin black manifests as a white canopy above the crown. The face becomes fair and luminous, perpetually radiant, as if encased in ice. This is the harmonious black, circulating through the right path from the *Weilü* Gate and returning to Kunlun.\n\n**Eleventh Mechanism: The Essence of Wood and Water**\nThe *hun* is the true qi of Wood, lead, and the dragon. The Lunar Spirit is the true qi within Water, mercury, and the tiger.\n\n**The Generation of the Five Phases and the Elixir**\nWater generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal—this is the Golden Elixir.\n\n**Twelfth Mechanism: The Union of Lead and Mercury**\nWhen lead and mercury unite, it is like spring snow within the Cavern Chamber and Jade Chamber, resembling the sun and moon in ceaseless revolution, penetrating downward to the Lu Gate. The Lu Gate consists of the two apertures within the nose, through which the harmonious true black descends from the Cavern Chamber and Jade Chamber, entering the Twelve-Storied Tower of the Lofty Mansion to reach the Jade Terrace. One must close the mouth and drink the fluid of the Jade Pool; only then does the elixir receive the fluid and pass through the Twelve-Storied Tower. Thus, it lingers subtly, neither entering nor exiting, traversing the twelve rings to descend to the Crimson Palace and pay homage to the Imperial Lord. The Imperial Lord is the heart, where the Southern Palace conceals true Water.\n\n**Thirteenth Mechanism: The Flow of Lead and Mercury**\nWhen lead and mercury unite and arrive at the Crimson Palace, they follow the current into the Black Sea. From the Black Sea, they flow into the Sea of Blood, from the Sea of Blood into the Sea of Essence, and from the Sea of Essence into the Sea of Marrow. The Sea of Marrow is the navel; opposite the navel lies the Dark Gate, and between them is the Yellow Court. Within it resides a sovereign, known as the Yellow Prime Lord. When lead and mercury reach the Yellow Court and behold the Yellow Prime Lord, they at last meet their master. The Yellow Prime Lord is true Earth.\n\n**Fourteenth Mechanism: The Formation of the Flowing Pearl**\nWhen lead and mercury unite within the Yellow Court and obtain true Earth, they gradually descend to one *cun* below the navel, called the Spirit Chamber. Within it dwells a divine tortoise that drinks the essence-black, transforming it into the *po* of beings, thereby forming the Flowing Pearl.\n\n**Fifteenth Mechanism: The Refinement of the Flowing Pearl**\nWhen lead and mercury transmute into the Flowing Pearl, the divine tortoise inhales and exhales, circulating it within the Spirit Chamber. Two *cun* below lies the Orchid Terrace and Purple Palace, within which is a chamber called the Jade Chamber. Inside the chamber stands a crucible, shaped like a gourd—square above and round below—where Water and Fire interact above and below, known as the *Completion of the Crossing*. To the left of the crucible is the sun, to the right the moon; the sun is the dragon, the moon the tiger. When lead and mercury enter the crucible, they take root and sprout. The fluid irrigates and germinates the sprout, called the Yellow Sprout. This completes the first transformation, the first revolution.\n\n**Sixteenth Mechanism: The Birth of the Yellow Sprout**\nThe Yellow Sprout is the root of lead and mercury, the foundation of harmonious true black. Metal and Wood overcome each other, dragon and tiger devour one another; lead transforms into the Infant, mercury becomes the Maiden. Like the moon’s third day, when it first appears in the *Geng* position, the true black of Water is newly born. This is the Flower Concealed in the *Kan* Gate, where true Metal is just concealed. This completes the second transformation, called the Second Black, the second revolution.\n\n**Seventeenth Mechanism: The Second Black**\nThe Second Black is the solar essence and lunar radiance, the image of dragon and tiger. By closing the breath and absorbing the fluid, the true black of the lower origin enters the crucible and transforms into something like a chicken’s egg. Within it lies the elixir, white outside and yellow within, where Water and Fire contend. Like the moon’s fifth day, when it appears in the *Ding* position, this is *Ren* Fire. The elixir in the crucible resembles thin ice—this is the third transformation, called the Divine Talisman of White Snow, the third revolution.\n\n**Eighteenth Mechanism: The Divine Talisman of White Snow**\nThe Divine Talisman of White Snow is the Infant as yang and the Maiden as yin; when yin and yang’s true black unite, they have not yet formed male or female. The elixir within the crucible reverts to the Flowing Pearl. By closing the breath to guide the true black, the crucible emits a sound like thunder. It then congeals into a mass, resembling the Valley Spirit, manifesting in four colors. Like the moon’s eighth day, when it stands opposite *Zi* and *Wu*, overcoming and subduing Water and Fire, this is the Fourfold Spirit Elixir. This is the fourth transformation, the fourth revolution.\n\n**Nineteenth Mechanism: The Fourfold Spirit**\nThe Fourfold Spirit is the white silver refined from black lead and the true mercury burned from the pearl. White Metal is essence, and essence is true Water and Fire. Water’s number is one, Fire’s number is two; the true black of the lower origin congeals into White Horse’s Teeth. Using the River Chariot to transport the harmonious true black, it circulates through the Elixir Field and cycles through the Stone Chamber. This is the White Horse’s Teeth, the fifth revolution.\n\n**Twentieth Mechanism: The White Horse’s Teeth**\nThe White Horse’s Teeth is the treasure formed when mercury congeals within the Elixir Field, like the bud of a pearl, its color like spring snow. Using the River Chariot to transport it into the Central Palace, the true black of the Yellow Court descends to the lower Elixir Field. The Teeth change color like that of chrysanthemums. By closing the mouth and drinking the fluid of the brain’s spirit, its taste is like millet, its fragrance like citrus—this is called the *Knife’s Edge*, also known as the River Chariot. This is the sixth transformation, the sixth revolution.\n\n**Twenty-First Mechanism: The Knife’s Edge**\nThe Knife’s Edge is the true black of the Yellow Court. By focusing the mind, closing the breath, and swallowing the nectar of Jade Spring, one guides the harmonious true black. The fluid is sweet and delicious, also called *Qiong* Nectar or Jade Fluid, like the full moon. On the fifteenth day, when the three *Qian* complete the Knife’s Edge, it transforms into a crimson hue, resembling a small mountain within the Elixir Field. A divine being, named the Cinnabar Radiance of the Sun, constantly guards the Treasure Mountain, called the Spirit Sand. This is the seventh revolution.\n\n**Twenty-Second Mechanism: The Spirit Sand**\nThe Spirit Sand is the treasure formed when lead and mercury unite, completing the Sevenfold Return Elixir. Within the crucible, it remains unmoving, like a mountain anchoring the lower Elixir Field, dispersing yin-black to form pure yang. The elixir’s color resembles a rooster’s comb, with pearls linked in succession above—this is the eighth transformation, the eighth revolution.\n\n**Twenty-Third Mechanism: The Sevenfold Return Sand**\nThe Sevenfold Return Sand is the true black that has formed the Infant, the true nature that communicates with the numinous. At times, it moves within the navel, ascending to pay homage to the Imperial Lord, circulating throughout the body to reverse aging and restore youth, turning white hair black again. When the revolutions of the elixir’s celestial cycle are complete, it is called the Returned Elixir. It enters the middle Elixir Field within the Crimson Palace, descends to the Three Corpses, and enters the Nine Cities, naturally acquiring the spirits of the three *hun* and seven *po*, which ever come to appear before the Daoist adept.\n\nThis is the ninth transformation, the ninth revolution.\n\n**Twenty-Fourth: The Ninefold Return Elixir’s Completion**\nThe true nature remains ever-present, daily passing through the Three Barriers and circulating within the Nine Palaces. The Three Elixir Fields each contain three palaces, making nine in total. Within the Nine Palaces are three halls, each with its sovereign who governs the myriad spirits. Only when these spirits never depart from the body can one attain longevity and enduring vision—this is called the True Person.\n\n**Twenty-Fifth: The Upper Elixir Field**\nThe Upper Elixir Field is the head, its rear called the Mud-Pill Palace. Within it resides the White Prime Lord, who governs six brain spirits and seven youths. The brain spirits are named Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother, also called Dao Father and Dao Mother. At the crown of the Mud-Pill Palace lies the Purple Tenuity Palace, also called the Kunlun Palace, wherein dwells the Imperial Lord, titled the Heavenly Emperor. He commands seventy-two spirits and twenty-four youths—this is called the True Person. Opposite the Mud-Pill Palace at the front is the Profound Darkness Palace, where the Cavern Chamber governs eighty-one spirits and thirty-six youths—this is called the Profound Darkness. These are the three palaces of the Upper Elixir Field. When the elixir returns here to pay homage, it is called the Sevenfold Return to Heaven and Humanity.\n\n**Twenty-Sixth: The Middle Elixir Field**\nThe Middle Elixir Field is the heart. One inch above it lies the Lotus Palace, wherein resides the Master Father and Master Mother, who govern one hundred twenty spirits and thirty-six youths, all clad in brocade cinnabar robes and jade-silk coverings. When the elixir reaches this palace, it turns crimson-purple and is called the Suspended Pearl, returning to the Central Palace. This palace is named the Crimson Palace, wherein dwells the Red Imperial Lord, clad in vermilion robes and crimson sashes, governing three hundred sixty fire spirits and sixty-four red-robed youths. This palace oversees the brewing of divine liquor, called the Golden Nectar. One inch below the heart is the Pass-Origin Palace, wherein resides the Dragon Emperor, governing three hundred forty spirits and forty-nine youths, all clad in five-colored robes. This palace constantly drinks the Cloud-Tooth Nectar, called the Five Elders’ Cloud-Tooth.\n\n**Twenty-Seventh: The Lower Elixir Field**\nThe Lower Elixir Field lies three inches below the navel and is called the Elixir Field. It contains three palaces. One inch below the navel is the Profound Prime Palace, wherein resides the Court Elder Lord, governing four hundred two spirits and one hundred twenty youths, all clad in azure silk robes and coverings. This palace’s sovereign constantly drinks the Immortal Wine of Zhongshan, commanding the six spirits to guard and stabilize the Stone Chamber—this is called the Golden Elixir. Birds feed upon it to become phoenixes; serpents consume it to become dragons—this is the Golden Elixir.\n\n**Twenty-Eighth: The Immortal**\nWhen one has accumulated the blackness of the black, naturally perfecting their true nature, this is called the True Person. Morning and evening, they guard the Three Ones and revolve the Five Phases, refining nectar and swallowing saliva, sealing the mouth and curling the tongue. By abstaining from the five grains, the body remains ever-fluid. They nurture the elixir, visualizing and contemplating the blackness, moving in stillness, circulating the qi through the four seasons to flow throughout the body. Constantly practicing ablution, the blood transforms into white cream, suffusing the entire body with smooth, lustrous radiance. Only then is the work of the Nine Returns complete—this is called the Great Return Elixir.\n\n**Twenty-Ninth: The Purple, Azure, and Yellow**\nDay and night, one contemplates this blackness, which naturally forms clouds, multiplying its power severalfold. It moves like a galloping horse, forever dispelling care and sorrow. The key lies in steadfast resolve and guarding tranquility. The incantation states:\n*The Dragon-Tiger True Elixir flows downward to this palace, its color purple, azure, and yellow. When gathered, it forms the Seven Treasures; when scattered, it becomes pearls. It irrigates the twenty-four nodes, corresponding to the twenty-four qi. Gathered as the Seven Treasures, it divides into twelve: the upper six form yang, the lower six form yin—this is called Qian and Kun. Qian is Heaven, the Father, yang—this is Metal. Kun is Earth, the Mother, yin—this is the Nine Returns.*\n\nTwo inches below the navel is the Yellow Court Inner Palace, wherein resides the Yellow Prime Lord, governing four hundred eighty-four spirits and one hundred eight youths, all clad in yellow robes and yellow silk. This palace constantly drinks the solar essence, its nectar irrigating the numinous root. Three inches below the navel is the Elixir Field, its palace called the Orchid Terrace Palace, wherein resides the Golden Lord, governing seven hundred twenty spirits and two hundred four youths, all clad in crimson brocade and golden-threaded robes. Within this palace, all is still and unmoving. Morning and evening, it consumes the Primordial Harmony qi and drinks from the Flowery Pool’s broth, transforming into the Purple Gold Elixir. The incantation states:\n*The liver spirit joins with brightness, the kidney spirit nurtures the infant. The upper hun is Embryonic Radiance, the middle hun is Effulgent Spirit, the lower hun is Dark Essence. The seven po are Corpse Dog, Hidden Arrow, Magpie Yin, Swallowing Thief, Foulness, and Dazzling Lung. Hasten, hasten, as in the law’s command!*\n\nAnother incantation states:\n*Manifest the blackness nine times, vanquish the malevolent po and inauspicious forces. Heavenly beasts guard the gates, jade maidens hold the passes. Refine the hun into a gentle substance, keeping it with me, never to move recklessly. Observe its form and cherish it. If you hunger or thirst, enter the Flowery Elixir. Hasten, hasten, as in the law’s command!*\n\n**Thirtieth: The Essence of the Hundred Grains**\nThe essence of the hundred grains is the earth’s vitality; the five flavors’ external allure is the stench of demonic filth. By abstaining from grains and forsaking fine tastes, following prior cultivation methods, the fetal qi naturally perfects its true nature.\n\n**Thirty-First: The Heart**\nThe heart is the sovereign within the body, the lord of the five viscera. When the heart is clear and serene, it commands the majesty of the myriad spirits. In movement and stillness, one constantly recites the prior incantation for forty-nine days, and the hundred spirits’ numinosity will manifest. Before any affair arises, a spirit will come to forewarn—this is the protection of the hundred numina. The elixir appears twice daily: at dawn upon the crown, at dusk upon the navel—this is called the Numinous Elixir.\n\n**Thirty-Second: Traversing the Six Directions**\nAt *mao* and *you*, concealment achieves completion. The kidneys are the root; the kidneys pertain to water, the heart to fire. The kidneys belong to the north, called Lead; the heart to the south, called Mercury. Water and fire complete each other—this is the principle of the Nine Revolutions, the rationale of the Returned Elixir. It is named: *Within the Li Palace lies the image, the image conceals true water; the Kan gate holds the flower, hiding refined gold.* This is called true Lead and true Mercury.\n\n**Thirty-Third: The Dragon and Tiger**\n*Mao* is the dark essence of the east’s blue-green wood, the solar soul, named the Dragon, concealed within the Li Palace. *You* is the dark essence of the west’s white metal, the lunar spirit, named the Tiger, emerging from the Kan position. This is the principle of reversal: above, it harmonizes with Jade Spring; below, with the Golden Gate. Jade Spring’s fluid and the Golden Gate’s essence—these two substances, yin and yang, interact within the Central Yellow Court, attaining the earth’s true dark essence, thereby forming the Purple Gold Elixir. The Returned Elixir is complete, granting one prolonged years and extended life—this is called the True Person.\n\n**Thirty-Fourth: The Jade Stem**\nSimply drink the Five Flowers daily, and the essence-dark naturally coalesces, like a stalk of white jade. Forever severing thoughts and desires, they self-extinguish. Wherever one wills to go, the intent arrives, and one may hold the breath for a thousand cycles. Whether sitting or moving, nothing obstructs. The hundred vessels flow smoothly, the flesh plumps, the body transforms—golden sinews, jade bones. This is called *refining form to generate spirit*, and the Dao of transcending the mundane to enter sagehood is fully realized!\n\n**Thirty-Fifth: The Life of Primal Yang**\nThe Cinnabar Field harbors within it a tortoise, which constantly drinks the harmonious dark and feeds on solar essence and lunar flower. One must abstain from the five grains and five flavors. The heart acts with virtue: rescuing those in peril, aiding those in distress, and when calamity befalls oneself, not avoiding it—thus the misfortune vanishes instantly. Disasters cannot taint, harms cannot entangle. This is cultivation, entering true sagehood—this is the true Dao.\n\n**Thirty-Sixth: The Secret Transmission**\nBathe, fast, and enter the chamber facing east. Recite the incantation ten thousand times, then loosen the hair and close the eyes, abandoning the five flavors. The true and proper dark returns, the mind’s gate stilled. When the count is complete, the Jade Maiden informs you, and the Six Dings pay homage to the Supreme. Then, facing north, declare: *The master imparts the Wind-Net Gold Sword, severing hair and flesh, ascending mountains to congeal the elixir, where the Jade Radiance may be proclaimed. Seven ancestors escape dark suffering, and one attains immortality.* This is the mechanism of cultivation—it may be called secret.\n\nIf you wish to transmit it, first observe the person: whether they practice filial piety at home, serve the state without fail, remain loyal and never forget kindness, accumulate good deeds among people, uphold virtue without lapse, and refrain from the ten evils. Only one who, upon receiving the master’s teaching, discards wealth like dust may be entrusted with transmission. Those who slight the Dao, valuing wealth over life, must not be taught—lest the master’s nine generations fall. Keep it secret! Keep it secret!\n\n\"Proceed! Here ends the true formula of the Golden Elixir, the mechanism of nurturing life.\"",

      "translated_text": "**The Authentic Scripture of the Life-Nurturing Mechanism and Golden Elixir**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Authentic Scripture of the Life-Nurturing Mechanism and Golden Elixir*\nOne scroll, unattributed; likely composed during the Northern Song dynasty.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Category of Miscellaneous Arts*.\n\n---\n\n**The Authentic Scripture of the Life-Nurturing Mechanism and Golden Elixir**\n\n**First Mechanism: The Primordial Lock**\nWithin the Primordial Lock, Heaven and Earth are born, the Qian and Kun, the sun and moon, and the stars are transformed. This is the Dark Abyss of the Primal Source, where purity and turbidity, black and white, become one. From black arises white, and from turbidity emerges clarity. Clarity is yang, Heaven, and life; turbidity is yin, Earth, and nature. From the One arises the Two, then the harmonious Center, which is the true black. This is the root of human existence: from black blood is born, blood transforms into essence, and essence circulates through the black, giving rise to *ying* and *wei*. When *ying* and *wei* intermingle, one enters the true Dao. Their stem converges into the One.\n\n**Second Mechanism: The Embryonic Sphere**\nThe second mechanism is called the Embryonic Sphere, resembling a hen’s egg, connected above by the stem. Atop the stem are two fine threads, as slender as silk: the left governs essence, the right governs urine. Life is prolonged through the black, which draws essence to form marrow. Marrow transforms into flesh and skin: flesh becomes fat, skin becomes blood; fat is black and fluid, while blood forms saliva. When saliva enters the *Weilü* (Tail Gate), there are three apertures: the left draws essence, the right draws blood, and the center circulates the black. Essence draws blood, and blood refines into essence. Essence is the foundation of human life and nature. As the *Yinfu Jing* states: \"When the Three Thieves are harmonized, the Three Powers are at peace.\"\n\n**Third Mechanism: The Upper Palace**\nThe Upper Palace is the Gate of the Brain Spirit, where the fluid is refined and swallowed. Beneath the tongue lie three apertures, corresponding below to the *Weilü* Gate. The left is called the Solar Soul, the Metal Gate; the right is called the Lunar Spirit, the Jade Portal; the center is named the Jade Spring, the gateway where the ten thousand spirits converge—this is the Jade Gate. When the Jade Gate is moist, the black flows and circulates; when it is dry, the body withers and decays. The essential technique of cultivation lies in refining, swallowing, and guiding the fluid to the lower source, where it transforms into Golden Fluid, then generates blood, and blood refines into essence, allowing the black to flow smoothly. Rotating left and right, it enters the Primordial Lock. From the Primordial Lock, it returns, passing through the *Weilü* to gather at the Dark Palace.\n\n**Fourth Mechanism: The Dark Palace and the Yellow Court**\nBefore the Dark Palace lies the Yellow Court. Essence, black, and blood circulate from the kidneys to the navel. The navel is the courtyard where the ten thousand spirits gather. Essence, black, and blood ascend from the *Weilü* Gate, first turning left to pay homage to the Yellow Prime Lord, the ancestor of Wood, thus forming lead.\n\n**Fifth Mechanism: The Return to the Dark Palace**\nFrom the Yellow Court, it rotates right and returns to the Dark Palace, entering the Central Dark Court. There, essence, black, and blood unite with Earth, merging into the One—this is called the *Primordial Black*. It occupies the position of the *First Nine*, giving rise to the Four Blacks, which are named lead. Lead is the yang within yin; the outer black is tin, the white is gold—this is the gold within water.\n\n**Sixth Mechanism: The Ascent of Lead-Gold**\nThe gold within lead ascends in reverse from the Dark Court. The Dark Court corresponds to the North, thus called the *Kan Male*. Gradually reversing its course, it ascends to Kunlun. At the nape lies the Golden Lock Gate; if not yet opened, one must sway and shake until the two leaves of the Golden Lock Gate part, allowing homage to the White Prime Lord. The gold within lead then transforms into true essence, called the *hun*—the black within Wood. This black passes through the Central Pool, entering the yin position, and becomes mercury.\n\n**Seventh Mechanism: The Transformation into Mercury**\nWhen lead enters the Central Pool, it transforms into mercury. The Central Pool is the *Niwan* (Muddy Pellet), wherein resides the spirit called the White Prime Lord, the spirit of the brain’s marrow. Lead is the *hun*; the white gold within lead is called the *Cinnabar Child*. The *Cinnabar Child* is the grandchild of Wood and the child of Fire, the yin within yang. From cinnabar emerges quicksilver, hence the name *Cinnabar Child*. The *Cinnabar Child* is the Old Woman, also the Lunar Spirit—the black of Water, thus revealing the Two Modes.\n\n**Eighth Mechanism: The Circulation of Mercury**\nMercury flows and circulates from the Central Pool of *Niwan*, soaring and descending like the true black of Water, its number being three. Thin as mist, it ascends Kunlun and enters the *Anou* Pool, where it circulates. The *Anou* Pool is called the Purple Tenuity Palace, within which dwells the spirit known as the Lord of Kunlun. The Purple Cloud Lord is the master of the hundred spirits. Lead and mercury become the left sun and right moon, circulating day and night, illuminating the Grotto Chamber. From the front, this is the number five of Wood.\n\n**Ninth Mechanism: The Perfection of Wood’s True Black**\nWhen Wood’s true black is complete, it becomes Solar Crystal, aligning with the *Jia* position. Internally, it sustains the liver, ruling in the *yin* (Tiger) hour, rotating left to arrive at the Dark Obscurity. One *cun* above the brows lies the Dark Obscurity Grotto Chamber—this is the pure yang black, now manifesting in azure hue, like a wheel covering the crown. It resembles a radiant purple mist, making the hair lustrous as if freshly washed. This is the *Weilü* Gate, circulating through the left path and returning to Kunlun.\n\n**Tenth Mechanism: The Perfection of Water’s True Black**\nWhen Water’s true black is complete, it becomes Lunar Radiance, aligning with the *Geng* position. Internally, it sustains the lungs, ruling in the *shen* (Monkey) hour, rotating right to arrive at the Dark Obscurity. One *cun* and two *fen* between the brows is called the Jade Chamber, where the pure yin black manifests as a white canopy above the crown. The face becomes fair and luminous, perpetually radiant, as if encased in ice. This is the harmonious black, circulating through the right path from the *Weilü* Gate and returning to Kunlun.\n\n**Eleventh Mechanism: The Essence of Wood and Water**\nThe *hun* is the true qi of Wood, lead, and the dragon. The Lunar Spirit is the true qi within Water, mercury, and the tiger.",

      "translated_text": "**The Generation of the Five Phases and the Elixir**\nWater generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal—this is the Golden Elixir.\n\n**Twelfth Mechanism: The Union of Lead and Mercury**\nWhen lead and mercury unite, it is like spring snow within the Cavern Chamber and Jade Chamber, resembling the sun and moon in ceaseless revolution, penetrating downward to the Lu Gate. The Lu Gate consists of the two apertures within the nose, through which the harmonious true black descends from the Cavern Chamber and Jade Chamber, entering the Twelve-Storied Tower of the Lofty Mansion to reach the Jade Terrace. One must close the mouth and drink the fluid of the Jade Pool; only then does the elixir receive the fluid and pass through the Twelve-Storied Tower. Thus, it lingers subtly, neither entering nor exiting, traversing the twelve rings to descend to the Crimson Palace and pay homage to the Imperial Lord. The Imperial Lord is the heart, where the Southern Palace conceals true Water.\n\n**Thirteenth Mechanism: The Flow of Lead and Mercury**\nWhen lead and mercury unite and arrive at the Crimson Palace, they follow the current into the Black Sea. From the Black Sea, they flow into the Sea of Blood, from the Sea of Blood into the Sea of Essence, and from the Sea of Essence into the Sea of Marrow. The Sea of Marrow is the navel; opposite the navel lies the Dark Gate, and between them is the Yellow Court. Within it resides a sovereign, known as the Yellow Prime Lord. When lead and mercury reach the Yellow Court and behold the Yellow Prime Lord, they at last meet their master. The Yellow Prime Lord is true Earth.\n\n**Fourteenth Mechanism: The Formation of the Flowing Pearl**\nWhen lead and mercury unite within the Yellow Court and obtain true Earth, they gradually descend to one *cun* below the navel, called the Spirit Chamber. Within it dwells a divine tortoise that drinks the essence-black, transforming it into the *po* of beings, thereby forming the Flowing Pearl.\n\n**Fifteenth Mechanism: The Refinement of the Flowing Pearl**\nWhen lead and mercury transmute into the Flowing Pearl, the divine tortoise inhales and exhales, circulating it within the Spirit Chamber. Two *cun* below lies the Orchid Terrace and Purple Palace, within which is a chamber called the Jade Chamber. Inside the chamber stands a crucible, shaped like a gourd—square above and round below—where Water and Fire interact above and below, known as the *Completion of the Crossing*. To the left of the crucible is the sun, to the right the moon; the sun is the dragon, the moon the tiger. When lead and mercury enter the crucible, they take root and sprout. The fluid irrigates and germinates the sprout, called the Yellow Sprout. This completes the first transformation, the first revolution.\n\n**Sixteenth Mechanism: The Birth of the Yellow Sprout**\nThe Yellow Sprout is the root of lead and mercury, the foundation of harmonious true black. Metal and Wood overcome each other, dragon and tiger devour one another; lead transforms into the Infant, mercury becomes the Maiden. Like the moon’s third day, when it first appears in the *Geng* position, the true black of Water is newly born. This is the Flower Concealed in the *Kan* Gate, where true Metal is just concealed. This completes the second transformation, called the Second Black, the second revolution.\n\n**Seventeenth Mechanism: The Second Black**\nThe Second Black is the solar essence and lunar radiance, the image of dragon and tiger. By closing the breath and absorbing the fluid, the true black of the lower origin enters the crucible and transforms into something like a chicken’s egg. Within it lies the elixir, white outside and yellow within, where Water and Fire contend. Like the moon’s fifth day, when it appears in the *Ding* position, this is *Ren* Fire. The elixir in the crucible resembles thin ice—this is the third transformation, called the Divine Talisman of White Snow, the third revolution.\n\n**Eighteenth Mechanism: The Divine Talisman of White Snow**\nThe Divine Talisman of White Snow is the Infant as yang and the Maiden as yin; when yin and yang’s true black unite, they have not yet formed male or female. The elixir within the crucible reverts to the Flowing Pearl. By closing the breath to guide the true black, the crucible emits a sound like thunder. It then congeals into a mass, resembling the Valley Spirit, manifesting in four colors. Like the moon’s eighth day, when it stands opposite *Zi* and *Wu*, overcoming and subduing Water and Fire, this is the Fourfold Spirit Elixir. This is the fourth transformation, the fourth revolution.\n\n**Nineteenth Mechanism: The Fourfold Spirit**\nThe Fourfold Spirit is the white silver refined from black lead and the true mercury burned from the pearl. White Metal is essence, and essence is true Water and Fire. Water’s number is one, Fire’s number is two; the true black of the lower origin congeals into White Horse’s Teeth. Using the River Chariot to transport the harmonious true black, it circulates through the Elixir Field and cycles through the Stone Chamber. This is the White Horse’s Teeth, the fifth revolution.\n\n**Twentieth Mechanism: The White Horse’s Teeth**\nThe White Horse’s Teeth is the treasure formed when mercury congeals within the Elixir Field, like the bud of a pearl, its color like spring snow. Using the River Chariot to transport it into the Central Palace, the true black of the Yellow Court descends to the lower Elixir Field. The Teeth change color like that of chrysanthemums. By closing the mouth and drinking the fluid of the brain’s spirit, its taste is like millet, its fragrance like citrus—this is called the *Knife’s Edge*, also known as the River Chariot. This is the sixth transformation, the sixth revolution.\n\n**Twenty-First Mechanism: The Knife’s Edge**\nThe Knife’s Edge is the true black of the Yellow Court. By focusing the mind, closing the breath, and swallowing the nectar of Jade Spring, one guides the harmonious true black. The fluid is sweet and delicious, also called *Qiong* Nectar or Jade Fluid, like the full moon. On the fifteenth day, when the three *Qian* complete the Knife’s Edge, it transforms into a crimson hue, resembling a small mountain within the Elixir Field. A divine being, named the Cinnabar Radiance of the Sun, constantly guards the Treasure Mountain, called the Spirit Sand. This is the seventh revolution.\n\n**Twenty-Second Mechanism: The Spirit Sand**\nThe Spirit Sand is the treasure formed when lead and mercury unite, completing the Sevenfold Return Elixir. Within the crucible, it remains unmoving, like a mountain anchoring the lower Elixir Field, dispersing yin-black to form pure yang. The elixir’s color resembles a rooster’s comb, with pearls linked in succession above—this is the eighth transformation, the eighth revolution.\n\n**Twenty-Third Mechanism: The Sevenfold Return Sand**\nThe Sevenfold Return Sand is the true black that has formed the Infant, the true nature that communicates with the numinous. At times, it moves within the navel, ascending to pay homage to the Imperial Lord, circulating throughout the body to reverse aging and restore youth, turning white hair black again. When the revolutions of the elixir’s celestial cycle are complete, it is called the Returned Elixir. It enters the middle Elixir Field within the Crimson Palace, descends to the Three Corpses, and enters the Nine Cities, naturally acquiring the spirits of the three *hun* and seven *po*, which ever come to appear before the Daoist adept.",

      "translated_text": "This is the ninth transformation, the ninth revolution.\n\n**Twenty-Fourth: The Ninefold Return Elixir’s Completion**\nThe true nature remains ever-present, daily passing through the Three Barriers and circulating within the Nine Palaces. The Three Elixir Fields each contain three palaces, making nine in total. Within the Nine Palaces are three halls, each with its sovereign who governs the myriad spirits. Only when these spirits never depart from the body can one attain longevity and enduring vision—this is called the True Person.\n\n**Twenty-Fifth: The Upper Elixir Field**\nThe Upper Elixir Field is the head, its rear called the Mud-Pill Palace. Within it resides the White Prime Lord, who governs six brain spirits and seven youths. The brain spirits are named Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother, also called Dao Father and Dao Mother. At the crown of the Mud-Pill Palace lies the Purple Tenuity Palace, also called the Kunlun Palace, wherein dwells the Imperial Lord, titled the Heavenly Emperor. He commands seventy-two spirits and twenty-four youths—this is called the True Person. Opposite the Mud-Pill Palace at the front is the Profound Darkness Palace, where the Cavern Chamber governs eighty-one spirits and thirty-six youths—this is called the Profound Darkness. These are the three palaces of the Upper Elixir Field. When the elixir returns here to pay homage, it is called the Sevenfold Return to Heaven and Humanity.\n\n**Twenty-Sixth: The Middle Elixir Field**\nThe Middle Elixir Field is the heart. One inch above it lies the Lotus Palace, wherein resides the Master Father and Master Mother, who govern one hundred twenty spirits and thirty-six youths, all clad in brocade cinnabar robes and jade-silk coverings. When the elixir reaches this palace, it turns crimson-purple and is called the Suspended Pearl, returning to the Central Palace. This palace is named the Crimson Palace, wherein dwells the Red Imperial Lord, clad in vermilion robes and crimson sashes, governing three hundred sixty fire spirits and sixty-four red-robed youths. This palace oversees the brewing of divine liquor, called the Golden Nectar. One inch below the heart is the Pass-Origin Palace, wherein resides the Dragon Emperor, governing three hundred forty spirits and forty-nine youths, all clad in five-colored robes. This palace constantly drinks the Cloud-Tooth Nectar, called the Five Elders’ Cloud-Tooth.\n\n**Twenty-Seventh: The Lower Elixir Field**\nThe Lower Elixir Field lies three inches below the navel and is called the Elixir Field. It contains three palaces. One inch below the navel is the Profound Prime Palace, wherein resides the Court Elder Lord, governing four hundred two spirits and one hundred twenty youths, all clad in azure silk robes and coverings. This palace’s sovereign constantly drinks the Immortal Wine of Zhongshan, commanding the six spirits to guard and stabilize the Stone Chamber—this is called the Golden Elixir. Birds feed upon it to become phoenixes; serpents consume it to become dragons—this is the Golden Elixir.\n\n**Twenty-Eighth: The Immortal**\nWhen one has accumulated the blackness of the black, naturally perfecting their true nature, this is called the True Person. Morning and evening, they guard the Three Ones and revolve the Five Phases, refining nectar and swallowing saliva, sealing the mouth and curling the tongue. By abstaining from the five grains, the body remains ever-fluid. They nurture the elixir, visualizing and contemplating the blackness, moving in stillness, circulating the qi through the four seasons to flow throughout the body. Constantly practicing ablution, the blood transforms into white cream, suffusing the entire body with smooth, lustrous radiance. Only then is the work of the Nine Returns complete—this is called the Great Return Elixir.\n\n**Twenty-Ninth: The Purple, Azure, and Yellow**\nDay and night, one contemplates this blackness, which naturally forms clouds, multiplying its power severalfold. It moves like a galloping horse, forever dispelling care and sorrow. The key lies in steadfast resolve and guarding tranquility. The incantation states:\n*The Dragon-Tiger True Elixir flows downward to this palace, its color purple, azure, and yellow. When gathered, it forms the Seven Treasures; when scattered, it becomes pearls. It irrigates the twenty-four nodes, corresponding to the twenty-four qi. Gathered as the Seven Treasures, it divides into twelve: the upper six form yang, the lower six form yin—this is called Qian and Kun. Qian is Heaven, the Father, yang—this is Metal. Kun is Earth, the Mother, yin—this is the Nine Returns.*\n\nTwo inches below the navel is the Yellow Court Inner Palace, wherein resides the Yellow Prime Lord, governing four hundred eighty-four spirits and one hundred eight youths, all clad in yellow robes and yellow silk. This palace constantly drinks the solar essence, its nectar irrigating the numinous root. Three inches below the navel is the Elixir Field, its palace called the Orchid Terrace Palace, wherein resides the Golden Lord, governing seven hundred twenty spirits and two hundred four youths, all clad in crimson brocade and golden-threaded robes. Within this palace, all is still and unmoving. Morning and evening, it consumes the Primordial Harmony qi and drinks from the Flowery Pool’s broth, transforming into the Purple Gold Elixir. The incantation states:\n*The liver spirit joins with brightness, the kidney spirit nurtures the infant. The upper hun is Embryonic Radiance, the middle hun is Effulgent Spirit, the lower hun is Dark Essence. The seven po are Corpse Dog, Hidden Arrow, Magpie Yin, Swallowing Thief, Foulness, and Dazzling Lung. Hasten, hasten, as in the law’s command!*\n\nAnother incantation states:\n*Manifest the blackness nine times, vanquish the malevolent po and inauspicious forces. Heavenly beasts guard the gates, jade maidens hold the passes. Refine the hun into a gentle substance, keeping it with me, never to move recklessly. Observe its form and cherish it. If you hunger or thirst, enter the Flowery Elixir. Hasten, hasten, as in the law’s command!*\n\n**Thirtieth: The Essence of the Hundred Grains**\nThe essence of the hundred grains is the earth’s vitality; the five flavors’ external allure is the stench of demonic filth. By abstaining from grains and forsaking fine tastes, following prior cultivation methods, the fetal qi naturally perfects its true nature.\n\n**Thirty-First: The Heart**\nThe heart is the sovereign within the body, the lord of the five viscera. When the heart is clear and serene, it commands the majesty of the myriad spirits. In movement and stillness, one constantly recites the prior incantation for forty-nine days, and the hundred spirits’ numinosity will manifest. Before any affair arises, a spirit will come to forewarn—this is the protection of the hundred numina. The elixir appears twice daily: at dawn upon the crown, at dusk upon the navel—this is called the Numinous Elixir.",

      "translated_text": "**Thirty-Second: Traversing the Six Directions**\nAt *mao* and *you*, concealment achieves completion. The kidneys are the root; the kidneys pertain to water, the heart to fire. The kidneys belong to the north, called Lead; the heart to the south, called Mercury. Water and fire complete each other—this is the principle of the Nine Revolutions, the rationale of the Returned Elixir. It is named: *Within the Li Palace lies the image, the image conceals true water; the Kan gate holds the flower, hiding refined gold.* This is called true Lead and true Mercury.\n\n**Thirty-Third: The Dragon and Tiger**\n*Mao* is the dark essence of the east’s blue-green wood, the solar soul, named the Dragon, concealed within the Li Palace. *You* is the dark essence of the west’s white metal, the lunar spirit, named the Tiger, emerging from the Kan position. This is the principle of reversal: above, it harmonizes with Jade Spring; below, with the Golden Gate. Jade Spring’s fluid and the Golden Gate’s essence—these two substances, yin and yang, interact within the Central Yellow Court, attaining the earth’s true dark essence, thereby forming the Purple Gold Elixir. The Returned Elixir is complete, granting one prolonged years and extended life—this is called the True Person.\n\n**Thirty-Fourth: The Jade Stem**\nSimply drink the Five Flowers daily, and the essence-dark naturally coalesces, like a stalk of white jade. Forever severing thoughts and desires, they self-extinguish. Wherever one wills to go, the intent arrives, and one may hold the breath for a thousand cycles. Whether sitting or moving, nothing obstructs. The hundred vessels flow smoothly, the flesh plumps, the body transforms—golden sinews, jade bones. This is called *refining form to generate spirit*, and the Dao of transcending the mundane to enter sagehood is fully realized!\n\n**Thirty-Fifth: The Life of Primal Yang**\nThe Cinnabar Field harbors within it a tortoise, which constantly drinks the harmonious dark and feeds on solar essence and lunar flower. One must abstain from the five grains and five flavors. The heart acts with virtue: rescuing those in peril, aiding those in distress, and when calamity befalls oneself, not avoiding it—thus the misfortune vanishes instantly. Disasters cannot taint, harms cannot entangle. This is cultivation, entering true sagehood—this is the true Dao.\n\n**Thirty-Sixth: The Secret Transmission**\nBathe, fast, and enter the chamber facing east. Recite the incantation ten thousand times, then loosen the hair and close the eyes, abandoning the five flavors. The true and proper dark returns, the mind’s gate stilled. When the count is complete, the Jade Maiden informs you, and the Six Dings pay homage to the Supreme. Then, facing north, declare: *The master imparts the Wind-Net Gold Sword, severing hair and flesh, ascending mountains to congeal the elixir, where the Jade Radiance may be proclaimed. Seven ancestors escape dark suffering, and one attains immortality.* This is the mechanism of cultivation—it may be called secret.\n\nIf you wish to transmit it, first observe the person: whether they practice filial piety at home, serve the state without fail, remain loyal and never forget kindness, accumulate good deeds among people, uphold virtue without lapse, and refrain from the ten evils. Only one who, upon receiving the master’s teaching, discards wealth like dust may be entrusted with transmission. Those who slight the Dao, valuing wealth over life, must not be taught—lest the master’s nine generations fall. Keep it secret! Keep it secret!",
      "overlap_context": "overeign within the body, the lord of the five viscera. When the heart is clear and serene, it commands the majesty of the myriad spirits. In movement and stillness, one constantly recites the prior incantation for forty-nine days, and the hundred spirits’ numinosity will manifest. Before any affair arises, a spirit will come to forewarn—this is the protection of the hundred numina. The elixir appears twice daily: at dawn upon the crown, at dusk upon the navel—this is called the Numinous Elixir.",
