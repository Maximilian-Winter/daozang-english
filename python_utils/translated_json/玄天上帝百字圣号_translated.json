distressed.\nAll deeds and efforts wholly unfulfilled,\nLike the bright moon obscured by drifting clouds.\n\n**Plans and Hopes:**\nWithin your own heart, intentions waver,\nYet others remain unhurried, untroubled.\nWealth and possessions, like mountains, are fated—\nBest to guard the old and await the right time.\n\n**Household:**\nWhy does this household stir such sorrow?\nFrom north and south, misfortune presses near.\nOffer thanks to the gods, amend your ways for good,\nOr else your furrowed brow will never clear.\n\n**Marriage:**\nSweet words and clever speech—how false the heart!\nWild butterflies and reckless winds are not to trust.\nIf you doubt, just watch the garden’s blooms:\nOne gust of wind and rain, and all is undone.\n\n**Lost Property:**\nLost now, you rush in vain,\nNeglecting care until too late.\nTo know where traces lead,\nWait for the mid-month moon’s bright light.\n\n**Legal Matters:**\nAffairs weigh on the heart like a knife’s edge,\nBetter to endure than force a reckless hand.\nThough others spin in circles, wheels within wheels,\nThe game may be won, but the move is not high.\n\n**Traveler:**\nYou ask of the traveler—still not returned,\nThe journey home blocked by mountain upon mountain.\nWith whip in hand and weary steed, he sets forth,\nOnly for threads of fate to bind him to noble ties.\n\n**Illness:**\nNo spirits guard this house—ghostly ills abound,\nThe sick grow faint, their minds adrift in time.\nIf you seek health and strength again,\nCast your wealth aside in charity’s swift act.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nFor the household, all is peaceful;\nlost property remains unseen.\nThe sick should perform blessings;\nwealth will not come.\nThe traveler has not arrived;\nlegal matters drag on.\nOfficial posts remain unattained;\nmarriage is hard to unite.\nA sixth-month birth brings difficulty;\nfields and silkworms yield halfway.\nLivestock remain safe.\n\n---\n\n**Divination Slip Thirty-Two: Ill Fortune – Stars Encroach Upon the Moon**\n\n**Sacred Meaning:**\nStars encroach upon the moon—beware,\nSmall mouths bring calamity, misfortune near.\nThe sick may yet recover half through rites,\nDevoutly pray to heaven, offer thanks sincere.\n\n**Plans and Hopes:**\nSince ancient times, fame, profit, and war’s schemes,\nThough many plot, few ever gain their prize.\nBetter to still the heart and bear with patience,\nLest cunning turns to folly, and you’re deceived.\n\n**Household:**\nWhy do shadows bring repeated woe?\nBecause the house is haunted by restless spirits.\nIf you seek peace and safety once again,\nSeek out a monk to honor the Dharma’s light.\n\n**Marriage:**\nThe match was meant to be, a union round,\nYet others stir up strife and ruin near.\nIf you would see it done, act swiftly now,\nOr linger in delay, alone and cold.\n\n**Lost Property:**\nClearly lost to the east, the truth is known,\nThough many know, none dare to speak its name.\nIf it is wealth, it will not be regained,\nEven kin will turn their backs, their hearts grown sour.\n\n**Legal Matters:**\nThe young stir trouble without cause,\nTwisting right into wrong, a bitter loss.\nSettle this swiftly, make peace now,\nLest you be dragged into prison’s walls.\n\n**Traveler:**\nGone in haste, yet slow to return,\nWhy does he tarry, lingering still?\nAlas, his path is blocked by unseen binds—\nPray for

curse,\nLest loved ones weep in sorrow’s wake.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nFor the household, fortune is ill;\nguard against gossip and strife.\nLost property remains unseen;\nillness is grave.\nWealth

Meaning:**\nNewly sharpened, the dragon sword gleams bright,\nWho dares stand against its charging might?\nNow grasped in hand, its power soars—\nA hero’s strength, beyond the common fight.\n\n**Plans and Hopes:**\nNot yet has Lei Huan returned it to the deep,\nThrough countless trials, its edge is forged in pain.\nThis will shall rise, a dragon in its time,\nIts towering horns piercing the azure sky.\n\n**Household:**\nA splendid home renewed, its fortunes rise,\nSpring’s season brings affairs to full reward.\nPlanting and harvest yield tenfold increase,\nAnd noble office brings harmony restored.\n\n**Marriage:**\nSince ancient times, marriage is no mere chance,\nEven across ten thousand miles, bonds form.\nNow is the time to seal this union true—\nDo not let the pipa drift to another’s shore.\n\n**Lost Property:**\nDo not fret over a moment’s loss,\nHasten home to plan your next pursuit.\nTo the northwest, where paths diverge,\nSomeone will face you, revealing all.\n\n**Legal Matters:**\nOthers stir trouble, dragging you in,\nNo need to doubt—this is no false dispute.\nA wise one will speak justice’s truth,\nNo righteous soul will suffer unjust blame.\n\n**Traveler:**\nThe sword leaves its bronze sheath, swift as its edge,\nThe traveler is already halfway home.\nIf he meets the hour of *zi* or *wu*, his return is near,\nFear not the mountains, though they number ten thousand.\n\n**Illness:**\nThe flesh may waste, yet bones remain unyielding,\nEach day brings weariness, but no true cure.\nIf you hold fast to loyalty and filial

years.\n\n**Plans and Hopes:**\nFor years beneath the pines, it cherished its plumage,\nRefusing to bow its head before the rich and noble.\nToday it soars into the azure vastness—\nOnly now is its

hidden protection—\nThe tracks may yet be found by the steps and bridge.\n\n**Legal Matters:**\nHeed these words of caution—no need for worry,\nThough the lawsuit reaches the court, you are not free.\nFortunately, a noble ally lends their strength,\nAnd your name shall never reach the imperial court.\n\n**Traveler:**\nI know you treasure letters from home as gold,\nBut today I bring news to ease your heart.\nThough the journey is long, home lies near—\nBeyond the gate, the horse whinnies as your traveler returns.\n\n**Illness:**\nThe calamity came as if bound for the Western Heaven,\nYet

schemes may yet succeed.\nBut when the Three Yangs usher in prosperity,\nKnow that fame and profit are ripe for the taking.\n\n**Household:**\nAuspicious qi welcomes your door, all things renewed,\nAs noble guests arrive, drawing close in kinship.\nIf autumn or winter bring delays,\nSpring and summer shall bring wealth and family to fruition.\n\n**Marriage:**\nHeaven ordains this bond, uniting two as one—\nHow could they not be destined, drawn together in counsel?\nIn clear waters, watch the fish at play,\nThen cast your line with care.\n\n**Lost Property:**\nThe trail is faint, the hiding

others’ wealth and rank, your heart grows restless.\nIf you seek fame and profit now,\nGo ask the Hegemon of Wu by the Black River.\n\n**Household:**\nWhy venture out when all is well?\nBeware lest fire or theft bring woe instead.\nThis spring, guard against harm to your family—\nOnly in autumn may you find peace.\n\n**Marriage:**\nYour heart now longs for swift union,\nYet fate and year do not align.\nIf you seek a partner now,\nWait until the Yellow River’s nine waves run clear.\n\n**Lost Property:**\nThe lost item lies plainly by the shore,\nBut you lack the fate to reclaim it.\nReturn home and weigh your heart—\nPerhaps the times are adverse; blame not the heavens.\n\n**Legal Matters:**\nDo not submit documents to the court, for it bodes ill—\nLest you be entangled and cast into
