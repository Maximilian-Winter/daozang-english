  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the \"Central Harmony\" Chapter of the *Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Inner Teachings***\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Commentary on the \"Central Harmony\" Chapter of the *Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Inner Teachings***\n**Author:** Unknown, approximately dated to the Tang dynasty.\nA commentary on the seventh fascicle of the *Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Inner Teachings*. One fascicle.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, *Tai Ping* Section.\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Master Zhang Daoling bowed with hands clasped before the Most High Lord Lao’s Way, saying: \"I wish to hear the clear instructions for cultivating the Dao, the origins of attaining the Dao, the graded ranks and standards, the methods of reverence and respect, the teachings of Central Harmony, the doctrines of longevity, and the rituals of precepts and prohibitions. This humble one, Daoling, stands at the lowest rank and has yet to comprehend the Inner Teachings. I beseech you to bestow compassion, unfold the sweet dew of the Dao, and let all celestial and human beings, men and women, hear the numinous sounds.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"Daoling’s questions regarding these methods are most excellent principles, the truest and foremost, the supreme and essential teachings—such doctrines are not found in the *Five Fascicles Scripture* of the Outer Teachings. I shall now expound upon them; listen carefully and receive them.\n\nThe *Scripture of Central Harmony* is indeed the wondrous formula for ascending to perfection and the essential method for entering the Dao. Its principles penetrate the profound mystery; its meanings encompass the dual abandonment. Cultivating it within oneself, the path to ascending mystery may be exhausted; cherishing it in one’s heart, the gate of the True Unity is thoroughly opened.\n\nWhat is meant by *Central Harmony*? *Central* is the name for that which is not external; *Harmony* is the term for following and complying. Gathering the mind within is called *Central*; aligning with the Dao without opposition is called *Harmony*. Thus, this teaching of *Central Harmony* follows the *Chapter on Opening Conditions*. Good and evil conditions cause people to abandon evil and practice good. Fearing they may become attached to good and evil, the teaching of Central Harmony is expounded. It not only instructs them to abandon evil but also urges them to contemplate goodness. Contemplating goodness and abandoning evil is called *Central Harmony*.\n\nWithin this single term *Central Harmony*, six distinctions are made:\n1. The first urges the cultivation of Central Harmony;\n2. The second, beginning with ‘I observe the ten directions,’ urges the cultivation of conduct free from transgressions;\n3. The third, beginning with ‘all men and women under heaven,’ urges the establishment of meritorious goodness;\n4. The fourth, beginning with ‘the Dao addresses Daoling,’ urges the practice of the method;\n5. The fifth, beginning with ‘sensual desires ruin affairs,’ urges the upholding of the Five Precepts;\n6. The sixth, beginning with ‘upholding the method and cultivating the Dao,’ clarifies the benefits of reciting the scripture and practicing the teachings.\n\nThe preceding text is divided into two parts: first, the Heavenly Master requests the method of entering the Dao; second, the Heavenly Worthy explains the meaning of Central Harmony. Within the request, there are two intentions: the initial request and the explanation of its purpose.\n\nNow, first, the occasion of the Heavenly Master’s request is analyzed, from the Heavenly Master to the meaning of precepts and prohibitions. *At that time* refers to the moment when conditions and karmic connections converge. *Heavenly Master* is the title of the Dharma Master of the Three Heavens; *Zhang* is his surname, and *Daoling* his given name. *Bowed with hands clasped before the Way* signifies that when seeking instruction, one rises; when receiving teachings, one rises. Since he wished to inquire about profound meanings, he bowed with hands clasped before the Way.\n\n*I wish to hear the clear instructions for cultivating the Dao* means he desired to hear the distinct and essential instructions for cultivation. *The origins of attaining the Dao* refers to the original causes and methods of realizing the Dao and becoming a perfected one. *The graded ranks and standards* inquires about the hierarchical stages of practice and the sequence of attaining perfection. *The methods of reverence and respect* refers to the methods of careful reverence. *The teachings of Central Harmony* refers to the teachings of Central Harmony that align with the Dao. *The doctrines of longevity* refers to the teachings of attaining the Dao and longevity. *The rituals of precepts and prohibitions* refers to the regulations and prohibitions of the precepts.\n\nThis clarifies the Heavenly Master’s request. Below, the purpose of the request is explained. From *This humble one, Daoling, stands at the lowest rank* to *let all hear the numinous sounds*, the Heavenly Master, in seeking profound teachings, aimed to benefit others. Thus, he first adopted a joyful countenance and humble demeanor, humbly declaring himself a lowly disciple of the lowest rank, unversed in the principles of the Inner Teachings. He beseeched the Most High to bestow compassion, unfold the sweet dew of the wondrous Dharma, so that all celestial and human beings, men and women, might together hear the numinous and virtuous teachings.\n\nFrom the beginning up to this point, the Heavenly Master requests the essential methods of entering the Dao. From here onward, the Most High expounds the wondrous Dharma of Central Harmony. This section is divided into two parts: first, praising the request and granting permission to speak; second, the proper explanation. The first part is further divided into two: first, praising the request; second, granting permission.\n\nNow, the praise of the request: From *The Dao spoke: Daoling’s questions* to *such doctrines are not found in the scriptures*, the Most High praises the Heavenly Master, saying that the methods of attaining the Dao, the rituals of precepts and prohibitions, and the like, which you have just inquired about, are most excellent principles, the supreme and most true, the foremost and wondrous, the unsurpassed and profound essential teachings—such doctrines are not found in the *Five Fascicles Scripture* of the Outer Teachings.\n\nHaving praised the request, below, permission to speak is granted: *I shall now expound upon them; listen carefully and receive them.* *I* is the name of self-mastery. The Most High addresses the Heavenly Master, saying that your previous questions align perfectly with my intentions. I shall now unfold and expound upon them for you; listen carefully, receive them, and practice accordingly.\n\nFrom the beginning up to this point, the praise of the request and granting of permission are complete. From here onward, the proper explanation is given. This section is divided into three parts: first, the distinctions in the stages of attaining the Dao; second, the essential practices for entering the Dao; third, the Heavenly Master’s understanding and resolution.\n\nWithin the first part, there are four distinctions: first, presenting the three grades; second, listing the three names; third, explaining according to the names; fourth, concluding with an exhortation to practice.\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"In my teachings and commandments, there are clear instructions. The grades of attaining the Dao are invariably three: the highest attains immortality, the middle attains the Mud-Pill Palace, and the lowest attains longevity. Those who attain immortality and become perfected ascend to heaven naturally, riding the radiance of daylight to reach the Purple Dawn. Their heads bear fleshly topknots, and their bodies are like vajra. Jade lads scatter flowers, celestial maidens harmonize with mist, phoenixes sing on either side, and dragons chant before and behind. Their majesty and adornment are solemn and wondrous, all being celestial beings.\"\n\nThose who attain the Mud-Pill Palace transcend mortality, evade the Earth Bureau, and with their hun-souls and spirits purified and rectified, ascend to the Celestial Hall. Some fill vacancies among the immortals, others are born as sage-kings. Through successive transmigrations, they accumulate virtue and power, and when their deeds are complete and blessings established, cloud chariots come to welcome them. The merit of deliverance is not confined to a single lifetime. With unwavering resolve, they attain the rank of Immortal Kings.\n\nThe method for attaining longevity ensures robust health and averts death. By abstaining from grains and purifying the intestines, ceasing to rely on ordinary sustenance, and consuming herbs and plants, one repels corpse-demons. When their allotted lifespan ends, they avoid subjugation to the Northern Feng, becoming instead the masters of the underworld, overseeing the records of human and ghostly life and death. After three hundred and sixty years, they advance to become immortals. In calculating their merit, if they are reborn through gestation, their transmigration remains undying, sharing the same root as the Mud-Pill attainment.\n\nYet all three grades require the cultivation of the body, harmonizing qi and nature, reversing worldly conduct, severing attachments to glory and sensuality, and aligning with the Dao. These precepts comprise five meanings:\n\nFirst, one must not indulge in licentiousness, harboring wayward thoughts that exhaust the spirit and deplete essence, causing the hun and po souls to scatter, the upright qi to depart, and malevolent forces to draw near.\n\nSecond, one must not succumb to wrathful emotions, allowing the heart to surge with fury, the mouth to spew curses and invective, and the voice to shake heaven and earth. The spirits will not protect such a person; the true officials within the body will report to the Three Heavens, inscribing one’s name in the ledger of sins, making immortality unattainable.\n\nThird, one must not harbor malicious thoughts or envy others. Heavenly spirits record such transgressions, and the Earth Bureau submits reports, inscribing one’s name in the Black Register, leading to punishment and even death. This is the gravest offense, bringing harm to descendants.\n\nFourth, one must not drink wine to the point of confusion, defiling the body and altering one’s true nature, disregarding scriptural precepts, flouting official laws, disrespecting parents and rulers, and failing to recognize kinship, all while being led astray by desire. The hun and po souls wail in sorrow, defilement taints the five spirits, and curses pour forth unrestrained, fostering rebellion and disobedience. Heaven inflicts calamity, and the body suffers misfortune.\n\nFifth, one must not covet wealth and profit, for wealth is but dung and dust, yet people wield knives in its pursuit. In this degenerate age, human hearts are treacherous and violent, and in seeking advantage, they devise schemes to harm others. Wealth becomes an enemy to the body—what use is it? If one possesses it without hoarding, one should plant it in the field of blessings. An empty hall and a purified chamber are the abodes of immortals.\n\nThese five precepts must not be violated even once. They are as perilous as treading on thin ice or walking on empty air; once the sentence is decreed, one remains unaware. The wise, whether sitting, rising, lying, or resting, must ever hold themselves in strict observance. Without transgression, the reward of blessings will be manifest.\n\nThose who disbelieve and slander the scriptural teachings, refusing to follow the Five Precepts, will incur calamity in this very life. What I have spoken is true and not false. At the outset of transmission, one must find the right recipient.\n\nDao-Ling bowed and assented, vowing to comply.\n\nTo propagate the teachings is to proclaim the scriptural doctrines, establish regulations and precepts, and possess clear and essential instructions. As for the grades of attaining the Dao, there are invariably three kinds. Having enumerated these, the text next lists their names: the highest attains immortality, the middle attains the Mud-Pill Palace, and the lowest attains longevity.\n\nImmortals soar freely, transforming in myriad ways. Some ride steeds to visit the Jade Dawn, others mount cloud chariots to roam the Wondrous Profit. They may be like the benevolent transformation of Ren An’s armor or Wang Zijin’s departure from the Zhou emperor.\n\nThose who attain the Mud-Pill Palace transcend mortality and realize non-action, discarding the corpse to cross to the other shore. They resemble Buddhist monks feigning entry into nirvana or immortal lords leaving behind empty coffins.\n\nThose who attain longevity enjoy extended lifespans and robust vitality, like Fang Shu, who lived nine thousand years, or Peng Zu, who reached eight hundred.\n\nHaving listed the three names, the text proceeds to explain them in order, from \"immortals attaining perfection\" to \"all being celestial beings.\"\n\nThese celestial immortals, having attained the true Dao, naturally become weightless, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, soaring on radiance and riding clouds to reach the Purple Tenuity’s palace. They consult the Jade Dawn’s great Dao and pay homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. Their heads naturally bear crimson topknots, requiring no combing, and their bodies possess vajra-like substance, impervious to harm. Jade lads attend beside them, scattering flowers like flying snow; celestial maidens burn myriad incenses, their fragrance as dense as ascending clouds. On either side, phoenixes sing and simurghs chant; before and behind, dragons encircle them. Their majesty and adornment are solemn and wondrous, all being celestial immortals.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of immortals. Next, the text explains the attainment of the Mud-Pill Palace, from \"transcending mortality\" to \"attaining the rank of Immortal Kings.\"\n\nThose who transcend the Mud-Pill Palace attain deliverance, evading the underworld’s ghostly officials. With their hun-souls and spirits purified and serene, they ascend to the Celestial Hall’s pure realm, some filling vacancies among the immortals, others born into the families of sage-kings. They must further accumulate virtuous deeds through transmigration, constantly cultivating the scriptural Dao. When the merit of three thousand deeds is complete and the power of ninety thousand virtues is perfected, cloud chariots come to welcome them, and divine dragons bear them aloft. Through successive transmigrations and the accumulation of good deeds, with diligent effort and unwavering resolve, they attain the rank of Immortal Kings, governing all numinous officials.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the Mud-Pill attainment. Next, the text explains longevity.\n\nThe method for attaining longevity ensures robust health and delays death, ultimately sharing the same root as the Mud-Pill attainment. The Way of longevity requires vigor and strength, necessitating abstention from grains to purify the intestines, dining on mist and absorbing qi, consuming green pines, ingesting purple cypress, savoring white atractylodes, and consuming Solomon’s seal. One repels the Three Corpses and Nine Worms, eliminating the Four Demons and bandits. When the allotted lifespan ends, one avoids the Northern Emperor’s Fengdu, instead becoming an underworld official, recording the life and death of humans and ghosts. After three hundred and sixty years, one advances to become an immortal. If the tally of merit remains insufficient, one may be reborn through gestation, yet their transmigration remains undying, sharing the same root as the Mud-Pill attainment.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the three grades’ relative profundity. The following section serves as the conclusion: all three require utmost effort and alignment with the Dao.\n\nThose who seek to attain the three preceding grades must all uphold precepts and cultivate the body, softening their qi and nature, ensuring their conduct is harmonious. Their actions must oppose worldly customs, severing all attachment to glory, sensual pleasures, and profit—only then may they align and unite with the Dao.\n\nThe above concludes the explanation of the three grades’ relative profundity in practice and rank. What follows next expounds the essential methods of harmony.\n\nWithin this section, five distinctions are made: first, the enumeration of precepts; second, their naming. The first, second, and third employ analogies to emphasize the precepts; the fourth clarifies the harm to those who transgress; the fifth urges transmission to the worthy.\n\nWe begin by enumerating the precepts. These precepts, in their meaning, number five—thus harmonizing them, or in practice, five articles. This enumeration complete, their names are listed below:\n\n1. One must not indulge in licentiousness or unite with depravity. First, one must not give free rein to lustful desires, allowing the mind to dwell on perversity, exhausting spirit and vitality, and damaging the hun and po souls. Once true departure occurs, bodily corruption swiftly encroaches. The hun and po refer to the three hun and seven po. The three hun are: the Radiant Spirit, the Embryonic Light, and the Dark Essence.\n\nThis concludes the first precept; the second follows.\n\n2. One must not give rein to anger or wrath. One must not indulge in contention, rage, or clamor, nor utter curses or imprecations that shake heaven or stir the earth with resentment. Such grave transgressions invite no divine protection; the Three Corpses within the body will report them, and the Three Heavens will record the offenses. Once condemned, one can never attain immortality. The Three Corpses are Peng Ju, Peng Zhi, and Peng Jiao.\n\nThis concludes the second precept; the third follows.\n\n3. One must not harbor malicious thoughts or toxic intentions. One must not entertain evil schemes, plot harm, envy the worthy, or resent those superior to oneself. Heavenly spirits will record such deeds, and earthly officials will report them, inscribing the transgressions in the Black Register. Not only will this bring punishment upon oneself, but calamity will also extend to descendants.\n\nThis concludes the third precept; the fourth follows.\n\n4. One must not drink wine to the point of madness and recklessness. One must not sink into drunkenness, defiling the five spirits, altering one’s true nature, violating scriptures and precepts, disregarding royal decrees, disrespecting teachers, and confounding proper relations. Even as the hun and po souls wail and the viscera seethe, one may still rail and rage, defying heaven, inviting misfortune and disaster upon oneself.\n\nThis concludes the fourth precept; the fifth follows.\n\n5. One must not covet wealth or money. Wealth and money are but dung and dust, hindering practice and burdening the body. In life, they invite robbery and plunder; in death, grave desecration. Since they are unnecessary, one should instead distribute them to sow blessings in the field of merit. An empty hall is called the home of immortals; its gates will naturally be pure and noble.\n\nThe above lists the Five Precepts. What follows employs analogies to urge adherence.\n\nThese five must not be violated even once; their blessings and retributions are manifest. To break even one is to perish, like treading on empty air or walking on thin ice. If one persists in transgression without repentance, the resulting guilt will be inescapable, known to all. The wise should take heed, ever vigilant in sitting and lying down. If one’s conduct remains unchanging, the principle of karmic reward will naturally become clear.\n\nThis concludes the analogies urging adherence; what follows clarifies the harm of violating precepts.\n\nIf there are those who doubt or disparage the scriptures, bringing misfortune upon themselves—such fools who scorn and reject the teachings, refusing to follow the Five Precepts, thereby committing the transgressions of the Three Evils—will suffer immediate calamities, as detailed in the first scroll of this scripture.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the harm to transgressors; what follows urges careful selection of recipients for transmission.\n\nWhat I have spoken today is true and not false. You must choose the right person to transmit this to, and never pass it on lightly.\n\nThis concludes the establishment of precepts; the Celestial Master responds below.\n\nDao-ling bowed his head, assented, and vowed to obey. With the instructions thus given, how could he dare disobey or neglect them? He rose, affirming his acceptance of the sacred words.\n\nThe above concludes the exhortation to practice harmonious conduct. What follows is the second major section, urging the cultivation of conduct free from transgressions.\n\nWithin this section, two main divisions exist: from the beginning to \"the residual qi in food,\" which enumerates transgressions and urges their abandonment; and from \"what Dao-ling and his lady wish\" onward, which expounds the methods for avoiding transgressions. The former is further divided into two parts: first, the enumeration of evil deeds; second, the clarification of hypocrisy to reinforce the initial exposition. This is further subdivided into four: first, the absence of goodness among worldly people; second, the presence of evil; third, the manifestation of evil persons; fourth, the enumeration of their evil deeds.\n\nThe Dao states: I observe the ten directions and all future ages—among the people, Daoists, men and women, the virtuous who uphold precepts, and those in the world who single-mindedly follow the Dao—there is not even one in ten thousand. Why is this so?\n\nIn later ages, customs grow shallow and base. Officials and commoners vie in ostentation, coveting glory and wealth, while benevolence and righteousness wither. Cunning is deemed wisdom; fathers and sons deceive one another; rulers and ministers betray their duties. They exchange favors and bribes to buy office...\n\nThey dismiss the loyal and upright, appointing the flattering and wicked; they trust treacherous ministers and form cliques to curry favor. The wealthy and noble chase one another’s company, while the poor and lowly are cast aside. Their robes, carriages, and horses are adorned with extravagant splendor, believing this brings success, and they fill the roads with their procession. Those who hold power and rank treat others as if they were nothing; those with even slight wealth see the rich and poor as walking separate paths. The noble and the base each follow what suits them; delighting in worldly affairs, how could they think of the Dao?\n\nSuch people, clinging to these attachments, are all fools. Though they may briefly enjoy ease, it is not worth desiring. Why is this so? Fools are shallow and superficial; once they attain glory and prominence, they become arrogant and extravagant, indulging in excess, following their whims without restraint, and disregarding propriety. The Dao’s purity and emptiness does not accept such people. With the divine now distant, evil spirits invade them. Some feign virtue while betraying truth, praying to ghosts and making supplications. The heavenly net is vast, and though their punishment has not yet come, it is inevitable.\n\nIt is like cooking rice: when the fire below is extinguished, the lingering steam in the pot cannot last long. Though evil people may not yet face retribution, they are like that fading steam. The Dao is profound—what people desire is life, prizing the years of their existence; what they despise is death, deeming it lowly. Is this not so? Heaven and earth are impartial, rewarding the good with life and punishing the wicked with death. This fortune and misfortune arise from the unseen. Calamity is not something the wealthy and noble can avoid through supplication, nor is it something the poor and lowly can escape by mere aversion.\n\nCultivating goodness brings blessings; doing evil invites disaster. Even if a ruler possesses boundless treasures, when facing death, he would offer a city’s worth of gold to beg for life—could it ever be obtained? The worthy, though poor and lowly, need not forcefully seek wealth and rank, exhausting their spirit and wasting their essence, abandoning what truly sustains them, growing arrogant and disordering their minds, causing them to lose the Dao and shortening their lives. Yet fools, seeing the wealthy and noble, desire to be like them, laboring in vain for such aspirations, and even if they attain it, it is not grand. Since what they gain is not grand, it is better to practice non-action.\n\nIf one seeks to fulfill their wishes, they should cultivate themselves, aspire to the Great Vehicle, harmonizing all—great and small—with a unified heart. They should receive the supreme great scriptures, prepare a hall for fasting with a seat for the celestial texts, sweep away dust and filth, maintaining purity and solemnity. They should burn incense and light lamps, illuminating their resting place, observe long fasts with earnest reflection, and meditate on the numinous and contemplate the true. The Dao will descend, and their wishes will be fulfilled in due time. Their seven generations of ancestors will receive blessings, and in life and death, they will attain immortality. As long as one practices diligently, the Dao will not fail them.\n\nIf one has wishes to fulfill, they should not rely on gold, silk, or bribes; nor on worldly connections or pride; nor on meat and wine offerings; nor on clever words or expedient means. With a sincere heart, they should return to the Dao, and through non-action, all will naturally come to fruition according to their original aspirations. If one wishes to create the conditions for merit, they may offer what they can—whether incense, oil, or alms during fasting—to establish their merit, contributing according to their capacity, without needing to give excessively. This makes clear that retribution cannot be limited or measured.\n\nIf one imitates worldly people, turning away from the Dao to pray to evil spirits, they will gain not a single blessing, and misfortune will block their door. However, even if one performs such meritorious deeds and fulfills their wishes, the rewards—though vast as the sky—still do not compare to receiving and upholding this scripture, making offerings and practicing rituals, and meditating on it day and night. The merit of such actions is greater by thousands or tens of thousands of times. Why is this? This scripture is what the perfected beings of the ten directions who have attained the supreme Dao aspire to practice, for it is the means by which they achieve the Way.\n\nIf there are good men and good women who can awaken their innate Dao-mind and receive and uphold this scripture, no wish will go unfulfilled, and no blessing will fail to come. Yet people differ in their capacities, and minds vary in sharpness and dullness. The wise and discerning, though they drill deeply with diligence, still fear they may not reach the goal; the foolish and ignorant, though they may stray and turn away, still fear they may not distance themselves enough. Given such differences, what more can be said?\n\nDao-ling, you should transmit this scripture to later students who are fit to attain the true. Even those of middling capacity should be enlightened, so they may enter the gate of the Dharma.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: I observe the men and women of the ten directions—whether Daoist priests or nuns, or laypeople—none cultivate goodness. Those who leave the household life harbor jealousy and plot in secret; those who remain in the world are arrogant, lewd, murderous, and thieving. Except for those who transcend the world, there is not a single one who gives their whole heart. This concludes the explanation of the absence of goodness; what follows clarifies the presence of evil deeds.\n\nWithin this passage, there are three distinctions: first, the exposition of evil deeds; next, the identification of evil people; and finally, the enumeration of their evil manifestations. Here, we first explain the evil deeds. Why does the Heavenly Worthy speak thus of the degeneracy and falsity of later ages, the shallowness of human sentiment, and the way officials and commoners compete for glory and splendor, abandoning the rites of benevolence and righteousness, knowing only to greedily pursue wealth and rank, turning from the Dao to practice cunning, fathers and sons deceiving one another to their faces, rulers and ministers harboring different intentions, seizing every opportunity to endanger one another?\n\nAs a ruler, one’s perception and hearing are not clear, and they trust the words of powerful ministers. They exchange favors and use bribes to buy office; they dismiss and exile the loyal and upright, appointing the wicked and flattering. The noble remain in the wilderness while the base occupy the court. They form factions and groups, the wealthy and noble chasing one another, abandoning the orphaned and widowed, oppressing the poor. Their carriages, horses, and robes are adorned with extravagant splendor, and they fill the roads with their ostentatious procession. Those in power treat others as if they were nothing; the rich and poor are treated as different species. Those who hoard wealth are called noble, while the poor and pure are deemed base. Delighting in worldly affairs, is there even one who thinks of the Dao?\n\nThis concludes the exposition of evil deeds; what follows identifies the evil people. Such reckless and unrestrained individuals are all worldly fools. Though they may briefly enjoy ease, how could they be worthy of desire?\n\nHere concludes the identification of evil people; what follows describes their evil manifestations. The reason for this is that foolish people, being shallow and base, are invaded by malevolent spirits. The purpose of these words is to address the shallowness of fools, who cannot look ahead or behind, relying on their power and excess, acting with arrogance and extravagance, transgressing laws and norms, indulging their desires without restraint, and disregarding rites and regulations. The Great Dao is frugal, pure, and empty—it does not accept such individuals. Since the divine spirits have already distanced themselves, malevolent ghosts readily invade and harm them.\n\nThis concludes the general exposition of evil deeds; what follows elaborates on their consequences. This section is divided into three parts: first, doctrinal explanation; second, analogical explanation; and third, the synthesis of analogy. We begin with the doctrinal explanation.\n\nSome align with falsehood and turn from truth, though their punishment has yet to be meted out. Others embrace calamity and deception, forsaking the Dao to revere evil, praying to ghosts and spirits for blessings and protection. Yet the heavenly net is vast and wide—though its mesh is loose, nothing escapes. Though the reckoning of sins may be delayed, the retribution for misdeeds is clear. Here ends the doctrinal explanation; what follows is the analogical explanation.\n\nIt is like extinguishing the fire after the rice is cooked—how can it last long? Here ends the analogy; what follows synthesizes it. Though evil people may not yet face punishment, they are like lingering embers.\n\nThus far, we have enumerated and examined transgressions. What follows presents the method to depart from wrongdoing. This section is divided into three parts: first, clarifying that the Dao of Heaven is impartial and inevitably metes out rewards and punishments; second, explaining that to depart from wrongdoing, one must only cultivate goodness; and third, demonstrating the harm of evil karma and urging its abandonment.\n\nWithin the first part, there are five subdivisions: first, explaining that human nature delights in life and abhors death, yet people fail to cultivate goodness and distance themselves from evil; second, clarifying that the Dao of Heaven is just and its rewards and punishments are unerring; third, showing that calamities and blessings arise from karma, not power or influence; fourth, advising the worthy not to covet worldly glory; and fifth, lamenting that fools cannot comprehend this.\n\nWe begin by explaining that people delight in life and detest death. The Lady of Daoling once wished that life be valued—yet is it not so? Worldly fools cannot cultivate goodness or distance themselves from evil; they merely wish for peace, longevity, and to avoid premature death or misfortune. Whether noble or base, who does not desire this? Here ends the explanation of delighting in life and detesting death; what follows clarifies that rewards and punishments are certain.\n\nHeaven and Earth are just and impartial. Though retribution emerges from the unseen, the heavenly eye is bright and clear, perceiving even the most minute details. Rewards for goodness and punishments for evil are decisive and unerring, all arising from the unseen, without letting worldly people perceive it. Here ends the explanation of unerring rewards and punishments; what follows demonstrates that the arising of good and evil is inescapable.\n\nDisasters and misfortunes are not what the rich and noble seek or pray for, yet they cannot be averted. Blessings and calamities arrive unexpectedly: the poor desire them but they do not come, while the rich try to repel them but cannot. Here ends the explanation of good and evil arising from karma; what follows elucidates the principle of karmic retribution.\n\nCultivating goodness brings blessings, while doing evil invites disaster—how can one escape? Cultivating goodness summons blessings, while doing evil inevitably incurs calamity. Neither rank nor position can avert it, nor can gold or jade bribe it away. Here ends the explanation of karmic retribution; what follows advises the worthy not to covet worldly glory.\n\nThe poor and lowly need not forcibly seek wealth and nobility. Riches and honor are decreed by Heaven, glory arises from karma—do not exhaust your spirit or waste your thoughts in improper striving. It leads people to lose the Dao, become confused, and shorten their years. Here ends the advice against coveting worldly glory; what follows laments that fools cannot comprehend this.\n\nYet fools, seeing the wealthy and noble, wish to equal them, unaware that their own fate is ill and their bones inauspicious. Even if they attain such status, it will not be grand or enduring; their downfall is near, and ruin inevitable. Better to still the heart, practice non-action, and remain free of trouble.\n\nThus far, we have clarified the impartiality of the Dao of Heaven. What follows urges the cultivation of conduct to depart from wrongdoing. This section is divided into five parts: first, urging cultivation; second, urging the abandonment of evil; third, extolling the supremacy of scriptures to encourage devotion; fourth, explaining the differing paths of fools and the wise, and the compassion of sages; and fifth, concluding with an exhortation to transmit these teachings.\n\nWe begin by urging cultivation. If you seek to fulfill your wishes and desires, all will accord with the intentions of your heart. If you desire long life, enduring vision, and the joy of non-action, first receive and uphold the scriptures. Harmonize your heart and devote your intent, prepare a pure and solemn hall with a proper seat, place the celestial texts reverently, and offer incense and lamps. Practice with single-minded devotion, empty the heart, and contemplate the true. The Dao does not fail those who act—it calculates merit and fulfills wishes. Seven generations of ancestors receive blessings, and the living attain immortality. If you but practice diligently, the scriptures will not be in vain.\n\nIf you seek to fulfill your wishes and desires, do not rely on bribes, wealth, clever words, or offerings of food and drink. In these four matters, if you act as desired, simply contemplate the Dao and preserve the true, and blessings will come naturally. Here ends the urging of cultivation; what follows encourages the establishment of merit.\n\nIf you wish to create fields of blessings, there is no limit to the merit. If you desire to build merit and establish virtue to seek hidden protection, you may, according to your faith, offer alms, incense, and oil, exerting your utmost sincerity. The blessings from such clarity are boundless. Thus far, we have urged the establishment of merit and cultivation; what follows urges the abandonment of evil.\n\nIf you imitate worldly people, turn from the Dao, and pray to evil spirits, disaster will block your door. Do not turn from the Dao, belittle the true, or revere evil. Praying to ghosts a thousand times will bring no blessing—only disaster will block your door. Here ends the urging to abandon evil; what follows encourages the reception of scriptures.\n\nWithin the section on upholding scriptures, there are three parts: first, explaining the supremacy of scriptures to encourage devotion; second, elucidating the purpose of receiving scriptures; and third, urging the benefits of upholding scriptures. We begin by considering the reception of scriptures.\n\nYet the merit and virtue thus cultivated, the benefits thus accrued—let us first urge the reception of scriptures. For the merit of such deeds, the fulfillment of such vows, may multiply a thousandfold, ten thousandfold. Yet when weighing the efficacy of virtuous practice, we find that no act of merit, no offering sown in fields of blessing, can compare to the reception and upholding of this scripture—even a single sentence, a single verse.\n\nThus far, we have extolled the supremacy of the scriptures to encourage devotion; below, we elucidate their purpose. Why is this so? This scripture is the path by which the perfected beings of the ten directions attain the Dao. It is the parent of all sages, the source from which all virtues arise, the way by which all who attain the Dao and achieve perfection must tread.\n\nNext, we expound the benefits of upholding the scriptures. If there be a virtuous man or woman who awakens the natural intent of the Dao and receives and upholds this scripture, what blessing will not be theirs? What goodness will not follow?\n\nThus far, we have weighed the merit of virtuous deeds and urged the benefits of upholding the scriptures. Below, we lament the divergence between the wise and the foolish in their choices. Alas! People differ in lifespan, and minds differ in acuity. Some are swift, some slow; some minds are bright, others dim. The wise exert themselves tirelessly, ever fearing they fall short; the foolish turn away and slander, their thoughts as distant as Mount Tai. How can such disparity be resolved?\n\nHere ends the lament of the sage; below, we urge the transmission of the teachings. Lord Dao commanded: \"You, Dao-ling, shall transmit this scripture to later disciples, guiding them into the gate of the Dao.\" When the Most High entrusted the Heavenly Master with the transmission of this scripture to later learners, there were signs of their destined union with the perfected. Whether in broad strokes or fine detail, one must weigh the essentials, that the filth of the heart may be cleansed and all may return to the chamber of the Dao.\n\nThus far, we have recounted past errors and urged their abandonment. What follows is the third section, which clarifies the harm of evil deeds and urges repentance. Within this section, there are two parts: first, the Heavenly Master’s inquiry, and second, the Dao Lord’s response.\n\nThe first part is further divided: first, the assembly of immortals present at the reception of the Dharma, and second, the circumstances of the inquiry. We begin with the immortals gathered at the time of the Dharma’s reception.\n\nAt that time, Dao-ling received the Dharma. All the great sages, Brahma-heaven Daoists, perfected beings of wondrous conduct, and envoys of the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions—seven hundred million in all—gathered before the Dao to praise Dao-ling. Amidst the assembly, Dao-ling, adorned in ritual vestments, stood with hands clasped before the Dao and inquired about the causes of calamity and fortune.\n\nDao-ling said: \"I observe that among all who revere the Dao and uphold the Dharma, some encounter disasters, sudden illnesses, or violent deaths; some face official summons, slander, or misfortune; their endeavors fail, their desires go unfulfilled. I do not know whether such afflictions arise from past karmic causes or present transgressions. I humbly beseech your illumination to clarify what remains obscure.\"\n\nThe Venerable Lord replied: \"Such misfortunes arise from human wickedness, and they are also the result of past lives. Why is this so? Though people revere the Dao, their devotion is not earnest. Though they know the Dao is supreme and wish to follow it, their conduct and nature remain no different from the vulgar. They do not cast aside deceit and falsehood, yet seek to approach the true and perfected with such impurity—this can never succeed. The true and the deceitful are as incompatible as thieves and watchful guards. Though they profess to follow the great Dao, they also pray to evil spirits, their hearts wavering between two paths, thus aligning themselves with the false. Such people, though nominally followers of the Dao, hope for its protection, yet the Dao does not accept them. Clinging to demonic influences, they claim allegiance to the Dao. When disaster, illness, misfortune, or peril strike, they expect the Dao to shield them, yet the Dao does not save them. Demonic spirits and malevolent ghosts assail them, and the Dao does not intervene. Their bodies meet death, their families face ruin. Yet these foolish and vulgar people fail to awaken, turning instead to resentment, declaring the Dao powerless. Even if they do not speak it aloud, their hearts harbor bitterness and reproach.\"\n\nHow can such people fail to rectify their conduct, transform their hearts, and immerse themselves in the passage of days and months, hoping to avert calamity? Not one in ten thousand shall be spared. Stubborn in their perverse nature, their hearts unchanged, upon the end of their lives, they shall descend into the Three Paths and Five Sufferings—then, what use is regret?\n\nHow grievous are these foolish and vulgar ones, who revere the false and belittle the true! Why do they not purify their hearts and renew themselves here and now? The wise hold fast to true faith, cultivating and upholding the scriptures and precepts.\n\nThe Great Dao is most revered, lofty and without peer, boundless and all-encompassing, enfolding heaven and earth. It governs the host of spirits, gives life to the myriad things—from the soaring and creeping to all creatures that breathe—all are brought forth by the Dao. The majestic spirit of the Dao gathers all, disperses all, dissolves all, accomplishes all, and subdues all. It grasps the pivot of heaven’s mechanism, commands the myriad spirits, precedes all that is prior, and exhausts all that is boundless.\n\nHumans dwell within it, their years and lives fleeting as the blink of an eye. All things are perfected by the Dao, all things arise from the Dao. It pities and cherishes all beings as a mother grieves for her child. Thus, it sets forth the laws for humanity, bidding them cultivate the Dao and practice its ways. Those who achieve great merit ascend as immortals; those of middling merit attain the Mud-Pill Palace; those of lesser merit extend their years.\n\nSuch towering rewards, yet people remain unaware, sinking together in delusion, refusing to cast off their vulgar deceits. For this, I shed tears and speak these verses:\n\nIn past lives, they sowed evil seeds,\nIn this life, they accumulate no pure fragrance.\nClinging to the false while professing the Dao,\nThey invite misfortune and ill fate.\nTrue qi lends no strength,\nWhile evil brings only disaster.\nWhen the Three Calamities arrive as one,\nTheir families are ruined, their bodies perish.\nSeven generations of ancestors sink into the Three Bureaus,\nTheir souls and spirits dragged away.\nThey tread upon the Mountain of Knives,\nTheir hands wounded by the Forest of Swords.\nAbove and below, the Five Courts of Suffering,\nBlood flows, festering into sores.\nFor ten thousand kalpas, no pardon is granted,\nAs they revolve through the Five Paths’ grounds.\nYet if there are those who follow the precepts,\nThe Heavenly Officials shall descend to welcome them.\n\nWhen the Heavenly Master received the Daoist teachings, the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, Daoist masters, Perfected Ones, and Transcendent Lords of wondrous realms dispatched envoys to offer praise. Some rode clouds or harnessed the sun, steering chariots upon celestial terraces—seven hundred billion in all, gathered beneath the Ascending Mystery Seat. Once this assembly had taken their places, the proceedings turned to the sequence of inquiries below.\n\nWithin this discourse, two distinctions are made: first, the effect is raised to trace its cause; next, the cause is examined to clarify its effect. The initial inquiry concerns the cause.\n\nDao-ling observed that those who devotedly follow the Dao and its precepts often fail to attain their desires. Though the world’s people uphold the Dao and its laws, and should be shielded by sacred power, why do they so frequently encounter misfortune, calamity, and peril—even untimely death? Some succumb to sudden illness, others to unjust imprisonment; their endeavors fail, and nothing prospers. This concludes the inquiry into effects to trace their causes. Next, the cause is examined to clarify the effect.\n\nIt remains unclear what offenses these individuals have committed. Are their sufferings the result of present transgressions or karmic retribution from past lives? With this question posed, the Most High Lord Lao begins His response.\n\nWithin His answer, prose and verse intermingle. The prose is divided into three main sections: first, the enumeration of evil deeds; second, the exhortation to abandon evil; and third, the encouragement to cultivate the Dao. The first section is further divided into two parts: first, the exposition of evil’s origins, and second, the explanation of evil’s manifestations.\n\nNow addressing the first part, Lord Lao replies: Such afflictions arise from human wickedness, rooted in past lives. These troubled souls fall into two categories: those who bring suffering upon themselves, and those upon whom past-life misfortunes descend.\n\nHaving outlined the origins of evil, the text proceeds to explain its manifestations. Why do those who follow the Dao with insufficient diligence fail to perceive its rewards? Initially, they may grow resentful, wavering in their commitment, lacking sincerity. Their devotion flickers, their resolve falters. Though they hear of the Dao’s exalted nature and rejoice in its pursuit, they have not shed worldly ways; their hearts remain tainted by deceit. How can they attain the true Dao while clinging to falsehood? When the false encounters the true, it is like a thief meeting a watchful guard. Because their hearts are not steadfast, Heaven allows evil to take hold. As they cling to corrupt spirits, the true Dao withholds its protection. Even when disaster or illness strikes, no aid is granted; the corrupt spirits prevail, leading to bodily death and the ruin of their households. Yet the foolish, worldly masses remain oblivious, even declaring the Dao powerless and harboring resentment.\n\nThis concludes the exposition of evil deeds; what follows is the exhortation to repent. Why do these individuals not rectify their conduct while repentance is still possible? Why do they not refine their precepts and transform their hearts? Day by day, they steep themselves in corruption. Heaven’s net is vast and wide-meshed, yet nothing escapes it; rewards for good and punishments for evil are meted out without exception. Why do you persist in perversity? If you cannot reflect on your transgressions and make amends, your life will end in the dark depths of evil destinies—what use will regret be then?\n\nHaving urged repentance, the text next exhorts the abandonment of evil. How pitiable are the foolish masses, who persist in error to this extent! The Great Sage, in boundless compassion, grieves for their plight. How can they bear to revere falsehood and belittle the Dao, refusing to uphold the precepts and cultivate truth? Why not wash away wickedness and renew yourselves with virtuous deeds?\n\nHaving enumerated evil and urged its abandonment, the text turns to the Dao to encourage its cultivation. This section is divided into four parts: first, the Dao’s exalted nature demands cultivation; second, the Dao’s power demands cultivation; third, the Dao’s creative capacity demands cultivation; and fourth, the Dao’s benefits demand its pursuit.\n\nFirst, the Dao’s exalted nature: The worthy must rectify their hearts, uphold the scriptures and precepts, for the Great Dao is most revered—all things arise from it. The wise and discerning should align their hearts, receive the great scriptures, and diligently cultivate the supreme Dao. The Dao’s laws are sublime and beyond comprehension. Heaven and Earth endure by its grace; the myriad beings flourish through its nurture. Vast, it encompasses all without limit; subtle, it enters the infinitesimal. Given the Dao’s lofty and wondrous nature, why do the worthy not cultivate and uphold it?\n\nNext, the Dao’s power: The Dao’s numinous might extends everywhere, even to the boundless. Its divine power summons all, averts all, subdues all. It grasps the celestial mechanisms, commands all spirits. It precedes all precedence, exhausts all limits. This concludes the explanation of the Dao’s power.\n\nNext, the Dao’s creative capacity: Though human lifespans are fleeting, one must cultivate the Dao and practice its ways. Though lives vary in length, all exist within the Dao’s creation. The Great Dao, like a mother grieving for her child, earnestly expounds the scriptures and precepts, urging all to cultivate the Dao and study immortality.\n\nHaving explained the Dao’s benefits, the text proceeds to assess merit and conduct. Those whose merit is supreme ascend as immortals. This illustrates how the depth of one’s merit determines the measure of one’s reward—yet people remain unaware, persisting in evil without reform, sinking together into ruin, with no hope of return. The Great Sage, moved by compassion, weeps for them and leaves behind scriptures and precepts, exhorting them to abandon wickedness.\n\nThis concludes the prose; what follows are the verses. The verses are divided into three parts: first, a single line on the causes of evil; next, a single line on the effects of evil; and finally, a single line exhorting the cultivation of the Dao.\n\nFirst, the causes of evil:\nIn past lives, they sowed evil seeds,\nIn this life, they accumulate no pure fragrance.\nClinging to the false while professing the Dao,\nThey invite misfortune and ill fate.\n\nThis concludes the verse on evil’s causes; next, the verse on evil’s effects:\nTrue qi lends no strength,\nWhile evil brings only disaster.\nWhen the Three Calamities arrive as one,\nTheir families are ruined, their bodies perish.\nSeven generations of ancestors sink into the Three Bureaus,\nTheir souls and spirits dragged away.\nThey tread upon the Mountain of Knives,\nTheir hands wounded by the Forest of Swords.\nAbove and below, the Five Courts of Suffering,\nBlood flows, festering into sores.\nFor ten thousand kalpas, no pardon is granted,\nAs they revolve through the Five Paths’ grounds.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis concludes the admonition against evil; next, the exhortation to cultivate the Dao.\n\nShould there be disciples of the precepts and laws,\nHeavenly officials descend to welcome them.\nIf there are disciples of the precepts and laws,\nHeavenly officials descend to greet them,\nPhoenix chariots drifting in misty clouds,\nDragon carriages towering amidst the void.\n\nFrom the above to this point concludes the exposition on avoiding transgressions. What follows is the third major section, urging the establishment of meritorious deeds.\n\nWithin this section, there are three distinctions:\nFirst, the prose exposition, to urge the establishment of merit;\nNext, the verse and hymn, to urge the practice of the Dao;\nAfter the verse, examples of benefits are given to encourage.\n\nWithin the prose exposition, there are four distinctions:\nFirst, the exhortation to reform transgressions;\nSecond, the exhortation to establish merit;\nThird, the exhortation to cultivate practice;\nFourth, the clarification of benefits obtained.\n\nWithin the section on reforming transgressions, there are two intentions:\nFirst, to urge the abandonment of evil and the preservation of mindfulness;\nNext, to urge the upholding of scriptures for repentance.\n\nThe first part has two aspects:\nFirst, to urge the abandonment of evil;\nNext, to urge mindfulness of the Dao.\n\nFirst, the correction of past transgressions is explained.\n\nThe Dao says: Men and women of the world, turning away from the true and correct, disobeying teachings and precepts, indulge only in lust, desire, wealth, honor, glory, sensual pleasures, riches, wine, and meat. They follow their hearts’ desires, acting with arrogance and excess—how could they ever contemplate the Dao?\n\nWhen people constantly contemplate the Dao, the Dao also contemplates them.\nPeople are like fish, the Dao like water—\nFish live when they obtain water, and die when they lose it.\nIf the qi of the Dao does not reside within,\nThe human body becomes empty;\nWhen the body is empty, how can it endure for long?\nThe key lies in diligent progress, preserving mindfulness of the utmost truth.\n\nI address all worthy ones: If you wish to preserve your life, transcend the mortal form, attain the Dao, and achieve true perfection, you should revere and receive *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Ascending Mystery and the Inner Teachings of the True One*. You must purify your hearts, eliminate past transgressions, reform and cultivate future goodness, and align with the scriptural laws.\n\nThose who can do this accord with the intent of the Supreme Orthodox and True Dao.\n\nAll who follow the Dao must eliminate transgressions, establish merit, reflect on their sins, and make amends for their faults.\n\nIf, before encountering the scriptural laws, you have killed with your own hands, you should save and revive one person on the verge of death to atone for it.\nOnce the transgression is eliminated, you also gain the merit of saving a life.\n\nIf you have committed robbery or theft, taking others’ property, after receiving the Dharma, you should vow with heart and mouth, using your private wealth to bestow alms upon the poor and establish meritorious deeds.\nOnce the debt is resolved, you also gain the reward of bestowing kindness.\n\nIf you have slandered those superior to yourself with your words, falsely accused and harmed the worthy and good, or wrongly accused the innocent, you should promote and elevate the worthy to make amends.\nOnce the burden is settled, you also gain the recompense of advancing the virtuous.\n\nTurning misfortune into fortune—these are the essential words.\n\nThus, when the practice of the Dao is established, your words and commands must be treasured.\nWhen you see others making mistakes, admonish and exhort one another, propagate the scriptural Dharma, and universally deliver gods and humans.\nLet all men and women obtain the benefits of the Dharma.\nSuch meritorious rewards are immeasurable.\n\nDo not claim the Dao is formless and act with arrogance and disdain. Instead, devote yourself to diligent cultivation, maintaining purity day and night.\nIf you see people suffering from illness, you should save and deliver them.\nDo not deceive the foolish with cunning, exploit power to feign deceit, rely on ghosts and spirits to intimidate the people, or seize others’ property.\nDo not boast of minor knowledge, claim greatness, belittle the foolish and lowly, or slander one another.\nDo not engage in frivolous discussions, pointing out the faults of the worthy.\nDo not harbor private greed and malice, respecting the noble while shaming the humble, favoring the rich while abandoning the poor, or feigning generosity for personal gain.\nDo not seek blessings by following personal desires, considering it benevolence.\nThe Dao will never comply, ghosts will not serve you, and if you destroy the true Dharma, you will suffer the consequences yourself.\n\nStrive to seek those of like mind, befriend those of the same Dharma.\n\nIf men and women cannot read or write, simply receive the scriptural Dharma, devote your hearts to the Dao, listen to the recitation of scriptures and precepts, gather in the fasting hall, and attentively receive without forgetting.\nYou may also burn incense in the hall, sit in purity, maintaining separation between men and women, with solemn and proper demeanor. Calm your spirits, concentrate your minds, and listen clearly to the sounds of the Dharma.\nDo not speak frivolously, lean or slouch improperly.\nDo not let your minds wander to other thoughts, grow lazy, or fall asleep. Do not face each other, chattering noisily, exhausting your bodies with self-imposed labor, suffering without gain.\n\nIf you can be reverent and solemn according to the Dharma, you will receive boundless blessings. The immortal officials who attend the scriptures will naturally come to protect you, ensuring you remain free from disaster and attain the Dao to ascend to heaven.\n\nThen, the Most High Lord Lao spoke in verse:\n\nRevere emptiness and honor the Great Vehicle,\nSevering both form and desire.\nThe essentials arise from diligent progress,\nLeaving no place for demonic forces to array.\nTransform misfortune by cultivating virtuous conduct,\nAnd past debts naturally vanish.\nMerit accumulates and renews daily,\nTranscending the mundane with distinction.\nWords and commands must be treasured and employed,\nGreat merit is thereby established.\nThere are foolish and evil people in the world\nWho invoke names and establish ghostly teachings.\nThey practice private deceit in public conduct,\nA thousand words yield not a single effect.\nIndulging their hearts in demonic affairs,\nThey bring upon themselves great trials.\nUnknowing of the source of their transgressions,\nThey suddenly meet with ruin and violence.\nTheir souls are imprisoned in the courts of Fengdu,\nWhere pain and poison arrive in full.\nYet there are those who delight in the Dharma,\nEntrusting their faith to causes and conditions.\nThough they may not understand written words,\nTheir hearts recognize the intent within.\nEmpty their minds of perverse thoughts,\nListening to the recitation of thousands of words.\nDevoting their hearts, they attain the Dao,\nThus becoming Supreme Perfected Ones.\nSimply by upholding and contemplating,\nTheir merit naturally fills the heavens.\n\nAll good men,\nFocus your minds and listen to my scripture.\nDo not engage in idle discussions,\nOr act without sincerity.\nFirst, it disrupts the supreme teachings;\nSecond, it exhausts the body.\nExhausting the body brings self-suffering,\nAnd the reward for love is not wisdom.\nYou should be reverent and solemn,\nDo not slight the divine spirits.\nWhen you see those who diligently progress,\nThey ascend as immortals to fill heavenly offices.\nSoaring beyond the Brahma realms,\nTheir learning is not at all difficult.\nWhy cling to the impurities of the world,\nAnd not aspire to transcend form and spirit?\n\n---\n\nThe Golden Gates offer no joy in wandering,\nTogether we serve at the Northern Portal.\nI see the fivefold sufferers’ torment—\nWailing atop the Knife Mountain’s peak,\nTheir faces bereft of human semblance,\nBegging among the hungry ghosts.\nHeaven’s punishments are ever applied,\nEnduring trials through kalpas unending.\nThis comes from failing to accumulate goodness,\nSlandering and harming the true and worthy.\nRetribution arrives in an instant,\nYet fools insist it is not so.\nIf one does not reform oneself,\nThey alone fall to heaven’s ruin.\n\nFar better to cultivate the great Dao,\nJoining the host of Perfected Ones.\nIn this world, men and women alike\nAll turn from the true and upright,\nUnable to uphold precepts or scriptures,\nOnly craving glory, wealth, and honor,\nIndulging in wine and meat to please their hearts,\nLetting wealth and desire fill their minds.\nThey know only excess, pride, and extravagance—\nNot one among them thinks of the Dao.\n\nThis first urges reform of evil,\nNext urges the keeping of mindfulness.\nThere is a dharma with parable,\nThat people may always think of the Dao,\nAnd the Dao will think of them in return.\nIf one can think of the Dao,\nHow could the Dao not think of them?\nThe analogy is made clear:\nPeople are like fish within water—\nWhen the water is lost, they die.\nThus the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says:\nPeople are within the Dao, the Dao within people;\nFish are within water, water within fish.\nWhen the Dao departs, people die;\nWhen water dries, the fish’s life ends.\nThis is the meaning.\nBelow, the analogy is applied\nTo urge the cultivation of the Dao.\nWhen the Dao’s qi does not abide,\nThe human body becomes empty.\nIf one maintains mindfulness of the utmost truth,\nThe Dao’s qi will not depart,\nAnd the body will not become empty.\nIf the body is empty,\nHow can it endure long?\nOne must diligently cultivate the supreme Dao,\nMaintaining mindfulness of the utmost truth.\n\nThis urges reform of evil and keeping of mindfulness.\nNext, it urges upholding scriptures to eliminate transgressions.\nThe text is divided into three parts:\nFirst, urging the upholding of scriptures;\nSecond, urging the elimination of transgressions;\nThird, clarifying attainment of the Dao.\nFirst, urging the scriptures:\nIt tells all worthy ones,\nIf you wish to preserve life and transcend the self,\nYou must revere the *True One Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.\nThe Dao tells the worthy:\nIf you desire life, transcendence, and attainment of the Dao,\nYou must honor and receive the *True One Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.\nIts power will sustain you,\nAnd you will naturally attain the Dao.\n\nThis urges the receiving of scriptures.\nNext, urging the elimination of transgressions:\nAll should purify their hearts\nTo accord with the scripture’s dharma.\nThey must wash away filth,\nReflect on their faults, and make amends,\nFollowing only the Dao,\nDevoting themselves only to the dharma.\n\nThis urges the elimination of transgressions.\nBelow, it clarifies attainment of the Dao:\nThose who can do this\nAccord with the intent of the supreme true Dao.\nIf one follows the Dao without deviation,\nThey merge with the utmost principle.\nThus the *Daoist Scripture* says:\nThose who are one with the Dao,\nThe Dao also attains them.\nThis is the meaning.\n\nThe above urges reform of transgressions.\nBelow, it urges the establishment of meritorious deeds.\nWithin the section on establishing merit,\nThere are five distinctions:\nFirst, urging the ransoming of lives;\nSecond, urging almsgiving;\nThird, urging the promotion of the worthy;\nFourth, clarifying the benefits of establishing merit;\nFifth, concluding exhortations.\nFirst, urging the ransoming of lives:\nAll who would embody the Dao\nMust eliminate transgressions and establish merit,\nEven gaining the merit of reviving others.\nAll who wish to embody the Dao\nMust eliminate transgressions and establish merit.\nIf before upholding scriptures and precepts,\nThey personally committed killing,\nThey should save those on the verge of death\nTo make amends for past faults.\nThus, their karmic debts are erased,\nAnd they also gain the blessing of aiding others.\n\nThis urges the ransoming of lives.\nNext, urging almsgiving:\nIf they once robbed others of their wealth,\nThey should also gain the reward of bestowing kindness.\nIf before hearing the scriptures’ dharma,\nThey plundered others’ possessions,\nThey should now vow in heart and word,\nReflect on their faults, and make amends.\nWith their own private wealth,\nThey should bestow alms upon the poor,\nPlanting seeds in the field of blessings,\nEstablishing merit and virtue.\nThus, their past debts are settled,\nAnd they also gain the merit of bestowing kindness.\n\nThis urges almsgiving.\nNext, urging the promotion of the worthy:\nIf they once slandered those superior to themselves,\nThey should also gain the reward of promoting the worthy.\nIf they ever slandered those superior to themselves,\nPraised the unworthy, or defamed the innocent,\nEnvying and resenting the noble,\nThey should now recommend and elevate the worthy,\nExtolling those of great learning.\nThus, their past debts are erased,\nAnd they also gain the reward of promoting the worthy.\n\nBelow, clarifying the benefits of establishing merit,\nTurning misfortune into blessing:\nThese are true and essential words—\nTheir merit is immeasurable.\nIt urges turning from evil thoughts\nTo cultivate blessings and goodness.\nWhen the Dao’s practice is established,\nIts words must be treasured.\nIf one sees others’ faults,\nThey should expound the scriptures and precepts,\nEnabling all—men and women alike—\nTo receive the dharma’s benefits.\nSuch merit is towering,\nBoundless and immeasurable.\n\nThis clarifies the benefits.\nBelow, it sets forth admonitions and exhortations:\nDo not think the Dao formless and become arrogant,\nBut diligently cultivate with reverence,\nMaintaining purity of heart day and night.\n\nThe above urges the cultivation of goodness and establishment of merit.\nBelow, it properly urges the abandonment of transgressions.\nThere are two distinctions:\nFirst, urging reform of transgressions;\nSecond, urging cultivation of goodness.\nFirst, urging reform of transgressions:\nIf one sees people suffering from illness,\nThey should save and deliver them.\nSeeing others in distress,\nAssist them in performing blessings.\nWith a mind to save and deliver,\nThey may attain peace and stability.\nDo not use cunning to deceive the foolish,\nRelying on spirits and ghosts to frighten the world,\nExtorting others’ wealth.\nThough possessing some spiritual insight,\nDo not manipulate the worthy,\nDisdain the lowly,\nSlander one another,\nRespect the noble and shame the humble,\nDelight in wealth and abandon the poor,\nHold love and hatred in duality,\nDeceive with false expectations,\nRefuse to follow others’ sentiments to bestow kindness,\nOr indulge desires and drive others away.\nCarefully consider:\nEven spirits and ghosts will not comply,\nAnd in the true dharma, there is truly no efficacy.\nInstead, one’s own body will suffer calamity.\n\nThis urges reform of transgressions.\nNext, urging cultivation of the Dao:\nThose of like aspiration should seek one another,\nThose of like dharma should befriend one another.\nThey must honor and receive the great scriptures,\nDevoting their hearts to delighting in the Dao.\nIf the dharma’s teachings are not yet clear,\nThey should consult those who understand,\nListening and reciting with careful reception,\nNot allowing forgetfulness.\nThey must also maintain solemn dignity,\nCalming the spirit and aligning the body,\nNot letting the mind wander to other thoughts,\nOr indulge in drowsiness and slumber,\nEngaging in idle chatter face to face—\nIn the end, they will gain nothing.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis concludes the urging to cultivate and depart from transgressions; below clarifies the benefits gained.\n\nIf one can be reverently attentive according to the dharma, then boundless blessings will be received, even to the point of attaining the Dao and ascending to heaven. If one can be reverently attentive according to the dharma, then immeasurable blessings will be received, and the immortal officials who attend the scriptures will naturally come to protect them. Not only will they be free from calamity for the remainder of their lives, but they will even ascend to the heavenly halls.\n\nThe preceding long prose passage concludes here. From this point onward, verses are recited to urge the establishment of merit.\n\nWithin the verses, there are divisions: first, two and a half lines praise the establishment of merit and the benefits gained.\n\n*\"In the world there are the foolish and ignorant...\"* (two and a half lines) describe the harm of evil conduct.\n\n*\"Those who delight in the dharma...\"* (five lines) urge the upholding of the scriptures.\n\n*\"Seeing those who are diligent...\"* (five and a half lines) present goodness in contrast to evil, urging choice between them.\n\nNow, first recite the upholding of the scriptures:\n\n**Honoring the Void, revering the Great Vehicle—**\n**Even demons dare not list their faults.**\n\nHonor the Void and uphold the Great Dharma.\nCut off all glory and desire, and eliminate them entirely.\nOnce diligence arises within the heart,\nWhat external demon would dare to enumerate their transgressions?\n\nThis concludes the urging to establish merit; below clarifies the benefits.\n\n**Transforming misfortune through cultivating virtue—**\n**Great merit is thereby accomplished.**\n\nIf one can abandon coarse thoughts and reform to cultivate good conduct,\nThen past transgressions and debts will naturally dissipate like clouds.\nVirtue and power tower majestically, advancing with each passing day.\nTranscending the mundane, one ascends lightly,\nUtterly distinct from the world.\nPeople must follow this great merit,\nFor it is thereby accomplished.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the benefits of establishing merit; next clarifies the harm of evil conduct.\n\n*\"In the world there are foolish people...\"*\nWho invoke names to establish ghostly teachings,\nPrivately deceiving yet openly practicing them—\nTen thousand words, not one is true.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of evil conduct; next clarifies the losses incurred.\n\n**Following the heart to perform demonic deeds—**\n**Punishment and suffering arrive thus.**\n\nIndulging one’s foolish nature to perform demonic deeds,\nCorruption fills and guilt is certain.\nCalamity and torment come of their own accord.\nUnaware of the day of death’s approach,\nSuddenly, brutal violence befalls.\nThe soul is imprisoned in the ghostly courts of Fengdu,\nWhere pain and poison reach their peak.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the harm of evil conduct. Below urges the cultivation of the scriptural dharma.\n\nThe text is divided into two parts: first, verses praising those who believe in the dharma; then, verses praising those who listen and receive it.\n\nFirst, recite those who practice the dharma:\n\n**Those who must delight in the dharma,**\n**Respect and believe, taking goodness as their cause.**\nThough they may not understand the written word,\nTheir hearts remain sincere and earnest.\nThey set aside right and wrong,\nListening to and reciting the scriptural passages.\n\nThis clarifies belief in the dharma; below clarifies the benefits gained.\n\n**Devoting the heart, the Dao is attained—**\n**Virtue and power naturally fill the heavens.**\n\nDevoting the heart, one attains the immortal Dao,\nAnd accomplishes the supreme, perfect truth.\nSimply by receiving and upholding the wondrous scriptures,\nVirtue and power naturally become vast.\n\nThe preceding verses on those who believe and receive conclude here. Below recite those who listen to the dharma:\n\n**All good men and women,**\n**Focus your hearts to listen to my scripture.**\nDo not face one another with idle chatter,\nNor harbor thoughts of confusion.\nFirst, this disturbs the supreme teachings;\nSecond, it wearies your bodies.\nWearying the body is but self-inflicted toil,\nLater receiving the retribution of dullness.\nIt is better to honor and serve the scriptural Dao,\nAnd never again slight the divine spirits.\n\nThe preceding urging to uphold the scriptures concludes here. Below presents goodness in contrast to evil to urge choice between them.\n\nThe text is divided into two: first, presenting good and evil to urge choice; then, urging cultivation of the Dao to clarify the benefits gained.\n\nThe first part is further divided: first, one line presents goodness to urge its adoption; then, five lines present evil to urge its abandonment.\n\nFirst, urging the adoption of goodness:\n\n**Seeing those who are diligent—**\n**Learning is thus not at all difficult.**\n\nSeeing those who are diligent,\nAbandoning the secular to cultivate the scriptural Dao,\nThey will surely attain immortality and transcend the world.\nThen, they will fill the heavenly offices,\nAscending high and soaring beyond the mundane,\nFlying beyond the bounds of the Brahma realms.\nThrough cultivation and learning, this is attained—\nTruly, it is not difficult.\n\nThis concludes the urging to adopt goodness; below urges the abandonment of evil.\n\n**Why cling to the impure and beautiful?**\n**Alone, you will fall to heavenly ruin.**\n\nThis laments that people of this age are submerged in worldly dust,\nNot aspiring to ascend in spirit and soar lightly,\nOr wander and feast in the mysterious capital.\nInstead, they will be bound to the northern gate,\nRevolving through the five destinies,\nWailing beside cauldrons of boiling water,\nShrieking atop blades and swords.\nTheir faces and bodies endure hardship,\nScorched by hunger and cold.\nBegging for food, they find no place to turn.\nHeavenly punishments are fully applied,\nTheir bodies suffer torment,\nFor kalpas upon kalpas, through countless years.\nAll because they slandered the worthy and good,\nDisbelieved in past lives,\nPersisted in evil without reform,\nAnd thus brought about their own heavenly ruin.\n\nThis concludes the urging to adopt goodness and abandon evil. Below urges cultivation of the Dao:\n\n**Nothing compares to cultivating the great Dao—**\n**The host of sages will gather with you.**\n\nNothing compares to cultivating the scriptures and propagating the Dao,\nIlluminating the dharma gate,\nSo that you may befriend the host of perfected immortals.\n\nThe preceding verses urging the establishment of merit conclude here. Below summarizes the urging to cultivate goodness and the benefits gained.\n\nThe text is divided into two: first, clarifying the benefits of self-cultivation; then, urging reverence and secrecy.\n\nAfter Laozi finished reciting the verses, he addressed Daoling, saying:\n\"In times past, through countless kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, in boundless and limitless eras, I cultivated this chapter, chanting its verses, practicing its rituals, and playing with its words, thereby attaining my present retribution. Its purport is subtle and profound, the mystery within the mystery. Now I tell you this in earnest—revere it well, and do not reveal it to those who lack faith.\"\n\nShould any harbor doubt or slander, their lineage shall be extinguished to the last.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: \"In kalpas past beyond count, I cultivated these scriptural verses, chanting their meaning, practicing their rites with diligent devotion, and thus attained the supreme Dao-fruit of this day. Know that the purport of this scripture is profound and far-reaching, the mystery within the mystery.\"\n\nHere concludes the exposition of its benefits; below urges reverence and secrecy. Now I earnestly tell you—hold it in deepest respect, for the consequences of transgression extend to the annihilation of one’s lineage. This great scripture I now proclaim to you; receive it with utmost care, cherish the Dao with fervent devotion, and transmit it no further. Should others doubt or revile it, their lineage shall be extinguished.\n\nHere ends the urging to establish meritorious deeds. Below begins the fourth major section of the preceding text, which exhorts the method of scripture cultivation, comprising both prose and verse. Within the prose, there are two divisions: first, presenting the dual conditions of good and evil to illustrate human life and destiny; then, setting forth the scriptural precepts to urge cultivation. The first division is further divided into two: first, the evils of life and death; then, the matters of karmic retribution. Within the former, there are four parts: first, the ignorance of the worldly; second, the shared desire for evil; third, the failure to attain one’s desires; fourth, the concluding exhortation to relinquish. We begin with the ignorance of the worldly.\n\nLord Lao addressed Daoling, saying: \"Among the ten thousand things, humans are the most noble. Yet dwelling between Heaven and Earth, all know the day of their birth but not the day of their death. Whether good or evil, wealthy or poor, each wishes for long life—who desires an early demise? Death is what humans do not delight in, yet how can any escape it? Only by not being born can one avoid this difficulty. Yet even this class has its causes and conditions: those who cultivate goodness receive goodness, and their spirits become good; those who commit evil receive evil, and their spirits become evil. Thus, half reside in the halls of my Dao, and half in demonic hells. It is like an echo—none fails to receive a response.\n\nHuman lifespan is ordained by the Void. The Void does not speak, so sages were established. Sages concealed their forms, leaving behind scriptures and precepts. These scriptures and precepts are called the Dao. They urge people to do good, teaching them to cultivate life, first to eliminate transgressions, second to attain immortality. Not only does one avoid death, but one becomes a perfected immortal. Such blessings cannot be obtained by seeking wealth or status, nor by offerings of wine and meat to spirits. They arise solely from the reverent observance of scriptures and precepts by worthy Daoists through diligent practice. First suffering, then reward—its response is clear as day.\n\nOf all that Heaven and Earth generate, humans are the most noble. Yet the foolish, clouded by delusion, lack clear wisdom. They know only the day of their birth and their wealth or rank, not the hour of their death.\"\n\nHere concludes the exposition of worldly ignorance; next, the shared desires of high and low.\n\n\"Whether good or evil, all share the same aspirations: to be wealthy, noble, and long-lived. Who would wish for poverty and an early death?\"\n\nHere concludes the exposition of shared desires for evil; next, the failure to attain one’s desires.\n\n\"Death is what humans do not delight in, yet how can any escape it? The body perishes, the soul departs—all abhor this, yet who can avoid it?\"\n\nBelow, the concluding exhortation: only by not being born can one avoid this. Though one may seek to avoid death, it is better still not to be born. Refine the body and return to the True—what affliction remains?\n\nHere concludes the exposition of the joys and sorrows of life and death to urge relinquishment; below, the matters of karmic retribution.\n\n\"Yet even this class has its causes and conditions—good and evil actions differ, and so do their karmic retributions. Thus, as spirits, their fates diverge, some ascending, some sinking. It is like an echo responding to a call, or a seed yielding its fruit.\"\n\nThis presents the causes and conditions of good and evil to awaken understanding. Below, the proper exposition of scriptural methods to urge cultivation. Within this section, there are three divisions: first, presenting the scriptures to urge; second, clarifying the benefits of the scriptures; third, explaining the methods of upholding the scriptures. We begin with presenting the scriptures to urge.\n\n\"Human life is ordained by the Void, so sages were established to expound scriptures and precepts. These scriptures and precepts are the Dao itself. Those who propagate the Dharma thereby attain the True Dao.\"\n\nHere concludes the presentation of the scriptures to urge; next, the benefits of cultivating the scriptures.\n\n\"Urging people to do good and teaching them to cultivate life—those who uphold the scriptures prolong their years. Not only do they avoid death, but they attain the True Dao and become immortals.\"\n\nHere concludes the exposition of the benefits of upholding the scriptures; below, the methods of cultivation.\n\n\"Such blessings cannot be obtained by seeking wealth or status, nor by offerings to spirits. Only through upholding the scriptures, observing the precepts, and enduring hardship in self-cultivation does the reward become as radiant as the sun and moon.\"\n\nHere concludes the prose on upholding the scriptures; below, verses exhort the same. Within this section, there are two parts: first, five lines urging the abandonment of evil to heed the scriptures—*Why not diligently ascend the Dao?*; then, one and a half lines urging diligent devotion to reform the Dao. The first part is further divided into three: first, the ignorance of the worldly; second, the divergent fates of ascent and descent; third, the exhortation to the scriptural Dharma.\n\nThus, Lord Lao spoke in verse:\n\n\"Humans are the most noble,\nYet take no joy in the Dharma’s splendor.\nLife and death follow their course,\nNone know where they shall go.\nIn darkness they seek without knowing,\nOnly at retribution’s hour do they awaken.\nThe wicked enter the three torments,\nThe good obtain great mercy.\nIf one accords with the True,\nHear the scriptures, contemplate goodness.\nDo not feign deafness and blindness,\nHearing the Dharma yet pretending folly.\nI pity all heavenly and mortal beings,\nThus I leave these supreme words,\nThe great Dharma for humanity,\nThe excellent physician for the world.\"\n\nWealth and bribes should be used in accordance with the Dao,\nDo not pray to deviant shrines.\nTen million times, not a single return,\nWhile malevolent qi brings daily increasing calamity.\nWhy not diligently follow the Supreme Dao,\nSeeing the Dharma and devising plans in the heart?\n\nThe wicked receive wicked retribution,\nYet it is better to establish a foundation of goodness.\nThrough苦行 one obtains sweet reward,\nNaturally ascending the Mystic Terrace.\n\nThe preceding verses admonish the ignorance of the worldly,\nThat humans are most noble,\nYet only at retribution’s hour do they awaken.\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nOnly humans are noble—\nWhy not diligently cultivate the scriptures,\nDelighting in purity and splendor?\nInstead, they surrender to fate, unaware of life and death’s course,\nWandering in endless darkness,\nOnly realizing at retribution’s hour.\n\nThis concludes the exposition on the ignorance of the worldly.\nNext, it distinguishes the divergent fates of ascent and descent:\nThe wicked enter the three torments,\nThe good obtain great mercy.\nThe wicked descend into hell,\nWhere body and soul suffer thrice daily;\nThe good ascend to heaven,\nWhere the Great Sage, in compassion, welcomes and guides them.\n\nThis concludes the distinction of divergent fates.\nNext, it exhorts listening to the Dharma:\nIf one accords with the True,\nHearing the scriptures and contemplating goodness,\nTo the point of \"malevolent qi brings daily increasing calamity.\"\nIf one accords with the True,\nOne must contemplate goodness and listen to the scriptures,\nNever feigning deafness and blindness,\nHearing the Dharma yet pretending folly.\n\nThe Great Sage pities all heavenly and mortal beings,\nThus leaving these supreme teachings,\nThe great Dharma for humanity,\nThe excellent physician for the world.\nWealth should be used in accordance with the Dao,\nNever praying to deviant shrines or spirits.\nTen million times, there is no return,\nWhile malevolent qi grows daily.\n\nThis concludes the exhortation to abandon evil;\nNext, it urges cultivation of the Dao:\nWhy not strive for the Supreme Dao,\nNaturally ascending the Mystic Terrace?\nWhy not diligently cultivate the Supreme Dao,\nSeeing the Dharma and devising plans in the heart?\nActing wickedly brings wicked retribution—\nBetter to establish a foundation of goodness.\nThrough苦行, the reward is naturally sweet,\nSerenely upon the Mystic Terrace.\n\nThus far, the exhortation to uphold the scriptural Dharma concludes.\nHereafter begins the second major section,\nWhich urges adherence to the Five Precepts.\nWithin this section, there are both prose and verse.\nIn the prose, five distinctions are made:\nFirst, citing evil to urge its abandonment;\nSecond, citing the precepts to urge cultivation;\nThird, clarifying the benefits of upholding the precepts;\nFourth, clarifying the losses of transgressors;\nFifth, exhorting secrecy and caution.\n\nFirst, urging the abandonment of evil:\nThe Dao states: Sensual desire ruins affairs—\nIt must not be indulged.\nYet all in the world, wise or foolish, noble or base, share the same desires.\nOnly Daoists can hold fast to their resolve,\nFirmly upholding the teachings and precepts,\nRestraining themselves,\nIn conduct and movement, their hearts never inclining toward deviance.\nAmidst love and desire,\nThey never transgress even once.\nWhen they see beauty, profit, glory, or dazzling splendor,\nThey cover their eyes with the precepts;\nWhen they hear praise or blame, or the five tones,\nThey seal their ears with the precepts;\nWhen they encounter the eight delicacies or sweet, fragrant delicacies,\nThey shut their mouths with the precepts;\nWhen they crave wealth, the seven treasures, or rare jewels,\nIndulging their passions to excess,\nThey subdue their hearts with the precepts;\nWhen their minds incline toward lewdness or covetous, wicked deeds,\nThey break their feet with the precepts.\n\nThose who can practice these five\nWill cause their seven ancestors to be born in heaven,\nClothed and fed naturally,\nTheir bodies attaining immortality,\nAscending at dawn in broad daylight.\nIf they undergo liberation by means of the corpse,\nThey will transform and become perfected.\nThe worthy, with sincere devotion, uphold these precepts.\nIf men or women cannot accept and practice them,\nThere is nothing to be done—\nI would rather give someone ten thousand gold pieces\nThan write these words.\n\nDao-ling, you must choose whom to transmit this to,\nDo not leak the true scripture.\nAttachment to sensual desire and emotion\nDestroys oneself and ruins the body.\nWorldly people cannot relinquish these.\nThis concludes the urging to abandon evil;\nNext, citing the precepts to urge cultivation.\n\nFirst, describing the upholder of the precepts,\nThen, the precepts themselves.\nOnly Daoists,\nTo the point of \"never transgressing even once\";\nOnly Daoists,\nAlone able to awaken and understand,\nFirmly upholding the teachings and precepts,\nRestraining body and mind,\nEven amidst love and desire,\nNever violating them.\n\nThis concludes the description of the upholder of the precepts;\nNext, the precepts themselves:\nWhen seeing beauty, profit, glory, or dazzling splendor,\nCover the eyes with the precepts, allowing no gaze;\nWhen hearing the five tones, lewd sounds, or seductive music,\nSeal the ears with the precepts, allowing no hearing;\nWhen encountering the eight delicacies or sweet, fragrant dishes,\nShut the mouth with the precepts, allowing no tasting;\nWhen desiring money, rare treasures, or exotic goods,\nSubdue the heart with the precepts, restraining thoughts and desires;\nWhen inclined toward lewdness or covetous, wicked deeds,\nBreak the feet with the precepts, preventing them from moving.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the precepts;\nNext, the benefits of upholding them.\nHaving described the practice of these five,\nNext, the losses of transgressors:\nIf men or women cannot accept and practice them,\nTo the point of \"I would rather give someone ten thousand gold pieces than write these words.\"\nLamenting that people of the age value wealth and despise the Dao,\nThus these words are spoken.\nTogether they sink and drown—what can be done?\nThis concludes the explanation of the losses of transgressors;\nNext, exhorting transmission.\n\nDao-ling, you must choose whom to transmit this to,\nDo not leak the true scripture.\nIf a person of reverence and faith,\nPossessing the ten superior qualities,\nComes seeking to receive it,\nFirst offer gold as a token of sincerity,\nTest them to ensure no retreat,\nThen entrust the scripture to them.\nIf they hesitate or doubt,\nKeep it secret and do not transmit it.\n\nThis concludes the prose;\nBelow are the verses.\nIn the verses, four distinctions are made:\nFirst, three and a half lines on the losses of those who do not uphold the precepts;\nSecond, three and a half lines on the benefits of upholding the precepts;\nThird, three lines on abandoning the five kinds of evil;\nFourth, two and a half lines on the benefits of reforming transgressions.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao then spoke in verse:\n\n\"What is desire?\nIt all arises from the heart.\"\n\nThe eyes behold radiant beauty,\nThe ears drink in the five tones,\nThe mouth savors the eight delicacies,\nThe heart covets wealth and glory,\nThe mind lusts after lewd and wicked deeds,\nThe hands and feet carry them out.\n\nWhen the five evils are not restrained,\nJudgment appears in the omen’s form,\nForever cut off from the Way of life,\nThe dark soul sinks into the ghostly prison.\nWhen the sentence is served and they emerge,\nThey are human in form but lack feeling.\n\nThose who uphold the precepts and do no evil\nSeal the five gates of the heart:\nThe eyes do not gaze on alluring appearances,\nThe ears do not seek clamorous sounds,\nThe mouth does not feast on sweet delights,\nThe heart does not love money and wealth,\nThe mind harbors no impure thoughts,\nThe hands and feet do not act on them.\n\nWhen the five evils are stilled and cease,\nHow can judgment be pronounced?\nForever united with the true Dao,\nNo longer do they fall to the ghostly officials.\nMerit accumulates from the precepts,\nAnd they ascend in broad daylight to the Jade Dawn.\n\nThe eye treats beauty as an enemy,\nNever wishing to see it once;\nThe ear treats sound as a foe,\nNever desiring to hear it;\nThe mouth treats flavor as bitterness,\nNever allowing itself to be tainted;\nThe heart treats treasure as fault,\nNever indulging in longing;\nThe mind treats wickedness as a thief,\nNever wishing to share its path;\nThe feet treat the level path as an obstacle,\nNever delighting to tread its course.\n\nThe five sufferings share one road,\nNever inclining toward perverse views.\nThose who can do this\nAre called the rarest of the rare.\nHaving mastered what is difficult,\nImpurities have no place to linger.\nThe body is pure, the spirit at peace,\nThe August One guards the cinnabar field.\nConduct perfected arises from cause,\nThus they ascend to the heavens above.\n\n\"What is desire?\nIt all arises from the heart.\"\nThe first \"desire\" refers to the mind of covetousness,\nThe second \"desire\" to the objects of greed.\nFrom where do these two minds arise?\nAll from one’s own inverted and deluded thoughts.\n\nThis concludes the general statement;\nBelow are the particulars.\nFrom \"The eyes behold radiant beauty\" to \"the hands and feet carry them out\":\nThe eyes recklessly gaze on the five colors,\nThe ears indiscriminately take in the five sounds,\nThe mouth relishes rich and crisp flavors,\nThe heart schemes for bribes and goods,\nThe mind, lusting after evil deeds,\nThe hands and feet then carry them out.\n\nThis clarifies the commission of evil;\nBelow, the losses are made clear.\nFrom \"When the five evils are not restrained\" to \"they are human in form but lack feeling\":\nWhen the five desires of the heart are unrestrained,\nDisaster and judgment appear in the omen’s form,\nForever cut off from the Way of long life,\nThe dark soul sinks into the ghostly prison.\nWhen the sentence is served and they emerge to receive form,\nTheir six senses are incomplete.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the harm from violating the precepts;\nBelow, the benefits of upholding the precepts are made clear.\n\"Those who uphold the precepts and do no evil,\nSeal the five gates of desire\"—this is the general statement.\nBelow are the particulars:\nFrom \"The eyes do not gaze on alluring appearances\" to \"the hands and feet do not act on them\":\nThe eyes do not behold beauty,\nThe ears do not seek sounds,\nThe mouth does not taste sweetness,\nThe heart does not accept wealth,\nEven the mind harbors no external thoughts,\nThe feet do not wander recklessly.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of upholding the precepts;\nBelow, the benefits are made clear.\nFrom \"When the five evils are stilled and cease\" to \"they ascend in broad daylight to the Jade Dawn\":\nWhen the five desires of the heart are stilled and cease,\nHow can judgment be falsely imposed?\nForever united with the true Dao,\nNo longer do they sink into the ghostly prison.\nMerit accumulates from the precepts,\nAnd they ascend in broad daylight to the Jade Capital.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the benefits of upholding the precepts;\nNext, the ability to abandon the five kinds of evil is expounded.\nFrom \"The eye treats beauty as an enemy\" to \"never delighting to tread its course\":\nThe eye treats beauty as an enemy,\nNever allowing itself a single glance;\nThe ear treats sound as a foe,\nNever permitting itself to hear;\nThe mouth finds flavor bitter,\nNever allowing itself to be tainted;\nThe heart treats treasure as fault,\nNever indulging in longing;\nThe mind treats wickedness as a thief,\nNever wishing to share its path;\nThe feet treat the level path as an obstacle,\nNever delighting to tread its course.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of abandoning the five kinds of evil;\nBelow, the benefits are made clear.\nFrom \"The five sufferings share one road\" to \"thus they ascend to the heavens above\":\nThe five desires arise from one mind,\nNever inclining toward perverse and deluded attachments.\nThose who can thus abandon them\nAre called the rarest of the rare.\nHaving mastered what is difficult,\nImpurities have no place to linger.\nThe body is pure, the spirit at peace,\nThe August One abides in the cinnabar field.\nConduct perfected arises from the precepts,\nThus they attain the Way of soaring emptiness.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the benefits of upholding the precepts.\nFrom here onward is the sixth major section,\nWhich exhorts the upholding of the scripture and cultivation of practice,\nTo clarify the benefits.\nWithin this text, there are four distinctions:\nFirst, cultivation of practice to abandon evil;\nSecond, establishing resolve to uphold the scripture;\nThird, the benefits of practicing the scripture;\nFourth, a warning against careless transmission.\n\nThe preceding text has two parts:\nFirst, an exhortation to cultivate the Dao;\nNext, an exhortation to abandon evil.\nIt speaks only of preserving the Dao:\n\"In upholding the Dharma and cultivating the Dao, be diligent;\nIn cultivating the body, be steadfast;\nIn advancing, be enduring;\nIn upholding the precepts, be firm;\nIn focused thought, be unwavering;\nIn careful contemplation, never depart from the Dao.\nAbandon evil, abandon delusion,\nAbandon demonic influences, abandon deceit,\nAbandon lewdness, abandon desire,\nCast aside all wrongdoing,\nThus embracing the true to attain ascent to the heavens.\nThis is to labor first and receive reward later,\nTo transcend the mortal body and ascend as an immortal.\nLook to the future, not merely the present.\nEvil brings no immediate calamity,\nGood brings no immediate blessing.\nReflect carefully on this,\nDevote yourself earnestly to the task,\nExert your strength in upholding the scripture and Dharma.\"\n\nThis scripture is lofty and wondrous,\nEncompassing the Three Caverns,\nThe supreme, most true, and foremost mysterious chapter.\nThose who receive and uphold it\nAre unexcelled among humanity.\nWithout the mysterious name,\nNot one in ten thousand will see it.\n\nThose with sincere intent should approach this as one parched and starving seeks food and drink, as one freezing seeks winter garments, or one sweltering seeks spring raiment; as the destitute finding treasure, or the lowly attaining rank. As one toiling desperately seeks rest, weary and longing for sleep; as one yearning, desiring fulfillment. Upon obtaining this scripture and Dharma, cultivate this resolve: endure hardship in accordance with the Dao, and boundless blessings shall follow.\n\nThis scripture has delivered countless souls. Those who cultivate the Dao and recite it shall attain the rank of Perfected; those in fear and reciting it shall be untouched by demons; the ill reciting it shall rise from their deathbeds; the distressed reciting it shall find natural joy; officials reciting it shall see their prison gates stay closed. If recited for the deceased, they shall rest in peace; the impoverished reciting it shall secure wealth; those facing mortal peril reciting it shall all have their lives extended; the ignorant reciting it shall gain wisdom and sagacity.\n\nOne who recites it bestows blessings upon nine generations of kin, delivers limitless beings, and nourishes the Ten Heavens. Without distinction of high or low, great or small, boundless and infinite, all receive the grace of compassion. You must guard this secret—take care not to recklessly disseminate it. To carelessly reveal the scripture or transmit it to the unworthy invites the judgment of wind-knives and consignment to the courts of ghosts. You would do well to heed this; my words are not empty.\n\nDao Ling bowed in reverence, expressed gratitude, and departed.\n\nThose who wish to uphold the scriptural precepts, study the Dao, and cultivate the body must fortify their resolve with sincerity, focus their thoughts with clarity, and keep the Dao in their hearts whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. This admonition to maintain mindfulness is followed by the exhortation to abandon evil and delusion, demonic influences and deceit, to the point of not being swayed by immediate pleasures. One must cast aside the six kinds of wrongdoing and embrace the true nature. Though the labor comes first, ascension to immortality follows. One should anticipate future rewards rather than seek present gratification.\n\nThis exhortation to forsake evil is followed by the encouragement to uphold the scriptures. It is divided into three parts: first, a direct exhortation; second, an illustrative exhortation; and third, a synthesis of the analogy. The preceding text is further divided: first, the encouragement to uphold the scriptures, then the praise of the scripture’s exalted virtue.\n\nHere begins the first part. Though evil brings no immediate calamity and good no immediate blessing, the transformation wrought by blessings and virtue is inevitable. One should therefore devote oneself earnestly to receiving the scriptural Dharma. This concludes the encouragement to receive the scriptures, followed by praise of the Dharma.\n\nThis scripture is lofty and wondrous, encompassing the Three Caverns, supreme and most true, the foremost of the mysterious. As the scripture is exalted, so too are those who receive it. Without the mysterious name and the bone of an immortal, one will never encounter this scripture. This concludes the praise of the Dharma. Below, an analogy is drawn: those with sincere intent should be like one parched and starving seeking food and drink, to the point of yearning for fulfillment. This concludes the analogy, followed by the synthesis: upon seeing this scripture and Dharma, one should cultivate this resolve, enduring hardship in accordance with the Dao, and boundless blessings shall follow.\n\nThe eight contemplations above, if pursued with diligence and in accordance with the Dao, will bring limitless blessings. This concludes the encouragement to uphold and recite the scriptures, followed by the enumeration of its benefits.\n\nThis scripture has delivered countless beings, and its ten blessings are as follows: those who cultivate the Dao and recite it attain the rank of Perfected; those in fear reciting it are untouched by demons; the ill reciting it rise from their deathbeds; the distressed reciting it find natural joy; officials reciting it see their prison gates stay closed; if recited for the deceased, they rest in peace; the impoverished reciting it secure wealth; those facing mortal peril reciting it have their lives extended; the ignorant reciting it gain wisdom and sagacity; and one who recites it bestows blessings upon nine generations of kin. This concludes the ten blessings of the scripture, followed by the expounding of its vast and far-reaching merits.\n\nIt delivers limitless beings, its grace flows through the Ten Heavens, without distinction of high or low, boundless and infinite, all bathed in its compassion. The blessings of this scripture are beyond comprehension, nourishing the Ten Heavens and flowing through all realms. This concludes the praise of the scripture’s benefits, followed by the warning against careless transmission.\n\nYou must guard this secret—take care not to recklessly disseminate it. To carelessly reveal the scripture or transmit it to the unworthy invites the judgment of wind-knives and consignment to the courts of ghosts. You would do well to heed this; my words are not empty. This concludes the warning, followed by the Heavenly Master’s reception of the teaching. Dao Ling bowed in reverence, expressed gratitude, and departed.\n\nHere concludes the scroll on the \"Harmonious Practice\" of the *Supreme Pervading Mystery Inner Teachings of the Numinous Treasure*. Next, the assembly shall convene at Penglai, where the revelation of the great and manifest truth shall be expounded.\n\nThen the Heavenly Master inquired further, saying: \"How may one be delivered from the myriad perils of the world?\"\n\nThe Most High Lord of Dao replied with a verse:\n\nThe Way of Heaven and Earth is boundless,\nThe mud-pill palace of the head is void and empty.\nIf you have not once vowed to uphold the precepts,\nHow can you hope to hear and recite the scriptures and commandments?\n\nThose who fail to understand this\nWill toil in vain and gain nothing.\nThey delight in superficial sentiment without true devotion,\nAnd though they seek, they shall not attain.\n\nNext, the text exhorts reverence and secrecy:\n\nHaving spoken the verse, the Lord of Dao addressed Dao Ling, saying: \"You must constantly guard these teachings in the depths of your heart. Those who recklessly disclose them shall incur the wrath of the Three Officers and be bound in the Nine Darknesses. Their lifespan shall be cut short, their plans thwarted, and their wealth scattered. This is the gravest of transgressions.\n\nOnly by embracing the truth and preserving the scripture’s secrecy may one ascend to the Eight Effulgences, emerge from the cycle of suffering, and attain treasures beyond measure.\"",

      "translated_text": "**Commentary on the \"Central Harmony\" Chapter of the *Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Inner Teachings***\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Commentary on the \"Central Harmony\" Chapter of the *Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Inner Teachings***\n**Author:** Unknown, approximately dated to the Tang dynasty.\nA commentary on the seventh fascicle of the *Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Inner Teachings*. One fascicle.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, *Tai Ping* Section.\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Master Zhang Daoling bowed with hands clasped before the Most High Lord Lao’s Way, saying: \"I wish to hear the clear instructions for cultivating the Dao, the origins of attaining the Dao, the graded ranks and standards, the methods of reverence and respect, the teachings of Central Harmony, the doctrines of longevity, and the rituals of precepts and prohibitions. This humble one, Daoling, stands at the lowest rank and has yet to comprehend the Inner Teachings. I beseech you to bestow compassion, unfold the sweet dew of the Dao, and let all celestial and human beings, men and women, hear the numinous sounds.\"\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"Daoling’s questions regarding these methods are most excellent principles, the truest and foremost, the supreme and essential teachings—such doctrines are not found in the *Five Fascicles Scripture* of the Outer Teachings. I shall now expound upon them; listen carefully and receive them.\n\nThe *Scripture of Central Harmony* is indeed the wondrous formula for ascending to perfection and the essential method for entering the Dao. Its principles penetrate the profound mystery; its meanings encompass the dual abandonment. Cultivating it within oneself, the path to ascending mystery may be exhausted; cherishing it in one’s heart, the gate of the True Unity is thoroughly opened.\n\nWhat is meant by *Central Harmony*? *Central* is the name for that which is not external; *Harmony* is the term for following and complying. Gathering the mind within is called *Central*; aligning with the Dao without opposition is called *Harmony*. Thus, this teaching of *Central Harmony* follows the *Chapter on Opening Conditions*. Good and evil conditions cause people to abandon evil and practice good. Fearing they may become attached to good and evil, the teaching of Central Harmony is expounded. It not only instructs them to abandon evil but also urges them to contemplate goodness. Contemplating goodness and abandoning evil is called *Central Harmony*.\n\nWithin this single term *Central Harmony*, six distinctions are made:\n1. The first urges the cultivation of Central Harmony;\n2. The second, beginning with ‘I observe the ten directions,’ urges the cultivation of conduct free from transgressions;\n3. The third, beginning with ‘all men and women under heaven,’ urges the establishment of meritorious goodness;\n4. The fourth, beginning with ‘the Dao addresses Daoling,’ urges the practice of the method;\n5. The fifth, beginning with ‘sensual desires ruin affairs,’ urges the upholding of the Five Precepts;\n6. The sixth, beginning with ‘upholding the method and cultivating the Dao,’ clarifies the benefits of reciting the scripture and practicing the teachings.\n\nThe preceding text is divided into two parts: first, the Heavenly Master requests the method of entering the Dao; second, the Heavenly Worthy explains the meaning of Central Harmony. Within the request, there are two intentions: the initial request and the explanation of its purpose.\n\nNow, first, the occasion of the Heavenly Master’s request is analyzed, from the Heavenly Master to the meaning of precepts and prohibitions. *At that time* refers to the moment when conditions and karmic connections converge. *Heavenly Master* is the title of the Dharma Master of the Three Heavens; *Zhang* is his surname, and *Daoling* his given name. *Bowed with hands clasped before the Way* signifies that when seeking instruction, one rises; when receiving teachings, one rises. Since he wished to inquire about profound meanings, he bowed with hands clasped before the Way.\n\n*I wish to hear the clear instructions for cultivating the Dao* means he desired to hear the distinct and essential instructions for cultivation. *The origins of attaining the Dao* refers to the original causes and methods of realizing the Dao and becoming a perfected one. *The graded ranks and standards* inquires about the hierarchical stages of practice and the sequence of attaining perfection. *The methods of reverence and respect* refers to the methods of careful reverence. *The teachings of Central Harmony* refers to the teachings of Central Harmony that align with the Dao. *The doctrines of longevity* refers to the teachings of attaining the Dao and longevity. *The rituals of precepts and prohibitions* refers to the regulations and prohibitions of the precepts.\n\nThis clarifies the Heavenly Master’s request. Below, the purpose of the request is explained. From *This humble one, Daoling, stands at the lowest rank* to *let all hear the numinous sounds*, the Heavenly Master, in seeking profound teachings, aimed to benefit others. Thus, he first adopted a joyful countenance and humble demeanor, humbly declaring himself a lowly disciple of the lowest rank, unversed in the principles of the Inner Teachings. He beseeched the Most High to bestow compassion, unfold the sweet dew of the wondrous Dharma, so that all celestial and human beings, men and women, might together hear the numinous and virtuous teachings.\n\nFrom the beginning up to this point, the Heavenly Master requests the essential methods of entering the Dao. From here onward, the Most High expounds the wondrous Dharma of Central Harmony. This section is divided into two parts: first, praising the request and granting permission to speak; second, the proper explanation. The first part is further divided into two: first, praising the request; second, granting permission.\n\nNow, the praise of the request: From *The Dao spoke: Daoling’s questions* to *such doctrines are not found in the scriptures*, the Most High praises the Heavenly Master, saying that the methods of attaining the Dao, the rituals of precepts and prohibitions, and the like, which you have just inquired about, are most excellent principles, the supreme and most true, the foremost and wondrous, the unsurpassed and profound essential teachings—such doctrines are not found in the *Five Fascicles Scripture* of the Outer Teachings.\n\nHaving praised the request, below, permission to speak is granted: *I shall now expound upon them; listen carefully and receive them.* *I* is the name of self-mastery. The Most High addresses the Heavenly Master, saying that your previous questions align perfectly with my intentions. I shall now unfold and expound upon them for you; listen carefully, receive them, and practice accordingly.\n\nFrom the beginning up to this point, the praise of the request and granting of permission are complete. From here onward, the proper explanation is given. This section is divided into three parts: first, the distinctions in the stages of attaining the Dao; second, the essential practices for entering the Dao; third, the Heavenly Master’s understanding and resolution.\n\nWithin the first part, there are four distinctions: first, presenting the three grades; second, listing the three names; third, explaining according to the names; fourth, concluding with an exhortation to practice.\n\nThe Dao spoke: \"In my teachings and commandments, there are clear instructions. The grades of attaining the Dao are invariably three: the highest attains immortality, the middle attains the Mud-Pill Palace, and the lowest attains longevity. Those who attain immortality and become perfected ascend to heaven naturally, riding the radiance of daylight to reach the Purple Dawn. Their heads bear fleshly topknots, and their bodies are like vajra. Jade lads scatter flowers, celestial maidens harmonize with mist, phoenixes sing on either side, and dragons chant before and behind. Their majesty and adornment are solemn and wondrous, all being celestial beings.\"",

      "translated_text": "Those who attain the Mud-Pill Palace transcend mortality, evade the Earth Bureau, and with their hun-souls and spirits purified and rectified, ascend to the Celestial Hall. Some fill vacancies among the immortals, others are born as sage-kings. Through successive transmigrations, they accumulate virtue and power, and when their deeds are complete and blessings established, cloud chariots come to welcome them. The merit of deliverance is not confined to a single lifetime. With unwavering resolve, they attain the rank of Immortal Kings.\n\nThe method for attaining longevity ensures robust health and averts death. By abstaining from grains and purifying the intestines, ceasing to rely on ordinary sustenance, and consuming herbs and plants, one repels corpse-demons. When their allotted lifespan ends, they avoid subjugation to the Northern Feng, becoming instead the masters of the underworld, overseeing the records of human and ghostly life and death. After three hundred and sixty years, they advance to become immortals. In calculating their merit, if they are reborn through gestation, their transmigration remains undying, sharing the same root as the Mud-Pill attainment.\n\nYet all three grades require the cultivation of the body, harmonizing qi and nature, reversing worldly conduct, severing attachments to glory and sensuality, and aligning with the Dao. These precepts comprise five meanings:\n\nFirst, one must not indulge in licentiousness, harboring wayward thoughts that exhaust the spirit and deplete essence, causing the hun and po souls to scatter, the upright qi to depart, and malevolent forces to draw near.\n\nSecond, one must not succumb to wrathful emotions, allowing the heart to surge with fury, the mouth to spew curses and invective, and the voice to shake heaven and earth. The spirits will not protect such a person; the true officials within the body will report to the Three Heavens, inscribing one’s name in the ledger of sins, making immortality unattainable.\n\nThird, one must not harbor malicious thoughts or envy others. Heavenly spirits record such transgressions, and the Earth Bureau submits reports, inscribing one’s name in the Black Register, leading to punishment and even death. This is the gravest offense, bringing harm to descendants.\n\nFourth, one must not drink wine to the point of confusion, defiling the body and altering one’s true nature, disregarding scriptural precepts, flouting official laws, disrespecting parents and rulers, and failing to recognize kinship, all while being led astray by desire. The hun and po souls wail in sorrow, defilement taints the five spirits, and curses pour forth unrestrained, fostering rebellion and disobedience. Heaven inflicts calamity, and the body suffers misfortune.\n\nFifth, one must not covet wealth and profit, for wealth is but dung and dust, yet people wield knives in its pursuit. In this degenerate age, human hearts are treacherous and violent, and in seeking advantage, they devise schemes to harm others. Wealth becomes an enemy to the body—what use is it? If one possesses it without hoarding, one should plant it in the field of blessings. An empty hall and a purified chamber are the abodes of immortals.\n\nThese five precepts must not be violated even once. They are as perilous as treading on thin ice or walking on empty air; once the sentence is decreed, one remains unaware. The wise, whether sitting, rising, lying, or resting, must ever hold themselves in strict observance. Without transgression, the reward of blessings will be manifest.\n\nThose who disbelieve and slander the scriptural teachings, refusing to follow the Five Precepts, will incur calamity in this very life. What I have spoken is true and not false. At the outset of transmission, one must find the right recipient.\n\nDao-Ling bowed and assented, vowing to comply.\n\nTo propagate the teachings is to proclaim the scriptural doctrines, establish regulations and precepts, and possess clear and essential instructions. As for the grades of attaining the Dao, there are invariably three kinds. Having enumerated these, the text next lists their names: the highest attains immortality, the middle attains the Mud-Pill Palace, and the lowest attains longevity.\n\nImmortals soar freely, transforming in myriad ways. Some ride steeds to visit the Jade Dawn, others mount cloud chariots to roam the Wondrous Profit. They may be like the benevolent transformation of Ren An’s armor or Wang Zijin’s departure from the Zhou emperor.\n\nThose who attain the Mud-Pill Palace transcend mortality and realize non-action, discarding the corpse to cross to the other shore. They resemble Buddhist monks feigning entry into nirvana or immortal lords leaving behind empty coffins.\n\nThose who attain longevity enjoy extended lifespans and robust vitality, like Fang Shu, who lived nine thousand years, or Peng Zu, who reached eight hundred.\n\nHaving listed the three names, the text proceeds to explain them in order, from \"immortals attaining perfection\" to \"all being celestial beings.\"\n\nThese celestial immortals, having attained the true Dao, naturally become weightless, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, soaring on radiance and riding clouds to reach the Purple Tenuity’s palace. They consult the Jade Dawn’s great Dao and pay homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. Their heads naturally bear crimson topknots, requiring no combing, and their bodies possess vajra-like substance, impervious to harm. Jade lads attend beside them, scattering flowers like flying snow; celestial maidens burn myriad incenses, their fragrance as dense as ascending clouds. On either side, phoenixes sing and simurghs chant; before and behind, dragons encircle them. Their majesty and adornment are solemn and wondrous, all being celestial immortals.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of immortals. Next, the text explains the attainment of the Mud-Pill Palace, from \"transcending mortality\" to \"attaining the rank of Immortal Kings.\"\n\nThose who transcend the Mud-Pill Palace attain deliverance, evading the underworld’s ghostly officials. With their hun-souls and spirits purified and serene, they ascend to the Celestial Hall’s pure realm, some filling vacancies among the immortals, others born into the families of sage-kings. They must further accumulate virtuous deeds through transmigration, constantly cultivating the scriptural Dao. When the merit of three thousand deeds is complete and the power of ninety thousand virtues is perfected, cloud chariots come to welcome them, and divine dragons bear them aloft. Through successive transmigrations and the accumulation of good deeds, with diligent effort and unwavering resolve, they attain the rank of Immortal Kings, governing all numinous officials.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the Mud-Pill attainment. Next, the text explains longevity.\n\nThe method for attaining longevity ensures robust health and delays death, ultimately sharing the same root as the Mud-Pill attainment. The Way of longevity requires vigor and strength, necessitating abstention from grains to purify the intestines, dining on mist and absorbing qi, consuming green pines, ingesting purple cypress, savoring white atractylodes, and consuming Solomon’s seal. One repels the Three Corpses and Nine Worms, eliminating the Four Demons and bandits. When the allotted lifespan ends, one avoids the Northern Emperor’s Fengdu, instead becoming an underworld official, recording the life and death of humans and ghosts. After three hundred and sixty years, one advances to become an immortal. If the tally of merit remains insufficient, one may be reborn through gestation, yet their transmigration remains undying, sharing the same root as the Mud-Pill attainment.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the three grades’ relative profundity. The following section serves as the conclusion: all three require utmost effort and alignment with the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Those who seek to attain the three preceding grades must all uphold precepts and cultivate the body, softening their qi and nature, ensuring their conduct is harmonious. Their actions must oppose worldly customs, severing all attachment to glory, sensual pleasures, and profit—only then may they align and unite with the Dao.\n\nThe above concludes the explanation of the three grades’ relative profundity in practice and rank. What follows next expounds the essential methods of harmony.\n\nWithin this section, five distinctions are made: first, the enumeration of precepts; second, their naming. The first, second, and third employ analogies to emphasize the precepts; the fourth clarifies the harm to those who transgress; the fifth urges transmission to the worthy.\n\nWe begin by enumerating the precepts. These precepts, in their meaning, number five—thus harmonizing them, or in practice, five articles. This enumeration complete, their names are listed below:\n\n1. One must not indulge in licentiousness or unite with depravity. First, one must not give free rein to lustful desires, allowing the mind to dwell on perversity, exhausting spirit and vitality, and damaging the hun and po souls. Once true departure occurs, bodily corruption swiftly encroaches. The hun and po refer to the three hun and seven po. The three hun are: the Radiant Spirit, the Embryonic Light, and the Dark Essence.\n\nThis concludes the first precept; the second follows.\n\n2. One must not give rein to anger or wrath. One must not indulge in contention, rage, or clamor, nor utter curses or imprecations that shake heaven or stir the earth with resentment. Such grave transgressions invite no divine protection; the Three Corpses within the body will report them, and the Three Heavens will record the offenses. Once condemned, one can never attain immortality. The Three Corpses are Peng Ju, Peng Zhi, and Peng Jiao.\n\nThis concludes the second precept; the third follows.\n\n3. One must not harbor malicious thoughts or toxic intentions. One must not entertain evil schemes, plot harm, envy the worthy, or resent those superior to oneself. Heavenly spirits will record such deeds, and earthly officials will report them, inscribing the transgressions in the Black Register. Not only will this bring punishment upon oneself, but calamity will also extend to descendants.\n\nThis concludes the third precept; the fourth follows.\n\n4. One must not drink wine to the point of madness and recklessness. One must not sink into drunkenness, defiling the five spirits, altering one’s true nature, violating scriptures and precepts, disregarding royal decrees, disrespecting teachers, and confounding proper relations. Even as the hun and po souls wail and the viscera seethe, one may still rail and rage, defying heaven, inviting misfortune and disaster upon oneself.\n\nThis concludes the fourth precept; the fifth follows.\n\n5. One must not covet wealth or money. Wealth and money are but dung and dust, hindering practice and burdening the body. In life, they invite robbery and plunder; in death, grave desecration. Since they are unnecessary, one should instead distribute them to sow blessings in the field of merit. An empty hall is called the home of immortals; its gates will naturally be pure and noble.\n\nThe above lists the Five Precepts. What follows employs analogies to urge adherence.\n\nThese five must not be violated even once; their blessings and retributions are manifest. To break even one is to perish, like treading on empty air or walking on thin ice. If one persists in transgression without repentance, the resulting guilt will be inescapable, known to all. The wise should take heed, ever vigilant in sitting and lying down. If one’s conduct remains unchanging, the principle of karmic reward will naturally become clear.\n\nThis concludes the analogies urging adherence; what follows clarifies the harm of violating precepts.\n\nIf there are those who doubt or disparage the scriptures, bringing misfortune upon themselves—such fools who scorn and reject the teachings, refusing to follow the Five Precepts, thereby committing the transgressions of the Three Evils—will suffer immediate calamities, as detailed in the first scroll of this scripture.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the harm to transgressors; what follows urges careful selection of recipients for transmission.\n\nWhat I have spoken today is true and not false. You must choose the right person to transmit this to, and never pass it on lightly.\n\nThis concludes the establishment of precepts; the Celestial Master responds below.\n\nDao-ling bowed his head, assented, and vowed to obey. With the instructions thus given, how could he dare disobey or neglect them? He rose, affirming his acceptance of the sacred words.\n\nThe above concludes the exhortation to practice harmonious conduct. What follows is the second major section, urging the cultivation of conduct free from transgressions.\n\nWithin this section, two main divisions exist: from the beginning to \"the residual qi in food,\" which enumerates transgressions and urges their abandonment; and from \"what Dao-ling and his lady wish\" onward, which expounds the methods for avoiding transgressions. The former is further divided into two parts: first, the enumeration of evil deeds; second, the clarification of hypocrisy to reinforce the initial exposition. This is further subdivided into four: first, the absence of goodness among worldly people; second, the presence of evil; third, the manifestation of evil persons; fourth, the enumeration of their evil deeds.\n\nThe Dao states: I observe the ten directions and all future ages—among the people, Daoists, men and women, the virtuous who uphold precepts, and those in the world who single-mindedly follow the Dao—there is not even one in ten thousand. Why is this so?\n\nIn later ages, customs grow shallow and base. Officials and commoners vie in ostentation, coveting glory and wealth, while benevolence and righteousness wither. Cunning is deemed wisdom; fathers and sons deceive one another; rulers and ministers betray their duties. They exchange favors and bribes to buy office...",

      "translated_text": "They dismiss the loyal and upright, appointing the flattering and wicked; they trust treacherous ministers and form cliques to curry favor. The wealthy and noble chase one another’s company, while the poor and lowly are cast aside. Their robes, carriages, and horses are adorned with extravagant splendor, believing this brings success, and they fill the roads with their procession. Those who hold power and rank treat others as if they were nothing; those with even slight wealth see the rich and poor as walking separate paths. The noble and the base each follow what suits them; delighting in worldly affairs, how could they think of the Dao?\n\nSuch people, clinging to these attachments, are all fools. Though they may briefly enjoy ease, it is not worth desiring. Why is this so? Fools are shallow and superficial; once they attain glory and prominence, they become arrogant and extravagant, indulging in excess, following their whims without restraint, and disregarding propriety. The Dao’s purity and emptiness does not accept such people. With the divine now distant, evil spirits invade them. Some feign virtue while betraying truth, praying to ghosts and making supplications. The heavenly net is vast, and though their punishment has not yet come, it is inevitable.\n\nIt is like cooking rice: when the fire below is extinguished, the lingering steam in the pot cannot last long. Though evil people may not yet face retribution, they are like that fading steam. The Dao is profound—what people desire is life, prizing the years of their existence; what they despise is death, deeming it lowly. Is this not so? Heaven and earth are impartial, rewarding the good with life and punishing the wicked with death. This fortune and misfortune arise from the unseen. Calamity is not something the wealthy and noble can avoid through supplication, nor is it something the poor and lowly can escape by mere aversion.\n\nCultivating goodness brings blessings; doing evil invites disaster. Even if a ruler possesses boundless treasures, when facing death, he would offer a city’s worth of gold to beg for life—could it ever be obtained? The worthy, though poor and lowly, need not forcefully seek wealth and rank, exhausting their spirit and wasting their essence, abandoning what truly sustains them, growing arrogant and disordering their minds, causing them to lose the Dao and shortening their lives. Yet fools, seeing the wealthy and noble, desire to be like them, laboring in vain for such aspirations, and even if they attain it, it is not grand. Since what they gain is not grand, it is better to practice non-action.\n\nIf one seeks to fulfill their wishes, they should cultivate themselves, aspire to the Great Vehicle, harmonizing all—great and small—with a unified heart. They should receive the supreme great scriptures, prepare a hall for fasting with a seat for the celestial texts, sweep away dust and filth, maintaining purity and solemnity. They should burn incense and light lamps, illuminating their resting place, observe long fasts with earnest reflection, and meditate on the numinous and contemplate the true. The Dao will descend, and their wishes will be fulfilled in due time. Their seven generations of ancestors will receive blessings, and in life and death, they will attain immortality. As long as one practices diligently, the Dao will not fail them.\n\nIf one has wishes to fulfill, they should not rely on gold, silk, or bribes; nor on worldly connections or pride; nor on meat and wine offerings; nor on clever words or expedient means. With a sincere heart, they should return to the Dao, and through non-action, all will naturally come to fruition according to their original aspirations. If one wishes to create the conditions for merit, they may offer what they can—whether incense, oil, or alms during fasting—to establish their merit, contributing according to their capacity, without needing to give excessively. This makes clear that retribution cannot be limited or measured.\n\nIf one imitates worldly people, turning away from the Dao to pray to evil spirits, they will gain not a single blessing, and misfortune will block their door. However, even if one performs such meritorious deeds and fulfills their wishes, the rewards—though vast as the sky—still do not compare to receiving and upholding this scripture, making offerings and practicing rituals, and meditating on it day and night. The merit of such actions is greater by thousands or tens of thousands of times. Why is this? This scripture is what the perfected beings of the ten directions who have attained the supreme Dao aspire to practice, for it is the means by which they achieve the Way.\n\nIf there are good men and good women who can awaken their innate Dao-mind and receive and uphold this scripture, no wish will go unfulfilled, and no blessing will fail to come. Yet people differ in their capacities, and minds vary in sharpness and dullness. The wise and discerning, though they drill deeply with diligence, still fear they may not reach the goal; the foolish and ignorant, though they may stray and turn away, still fear they may not distance themselves enough. Given such differences, what more can be said?\n\nDao-ling, you should transmit this scripture to later students who are fit to attain the true. Even those of middling capacity should be enlightened, so they may enter the gate of the Dharma.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: I observe the men and women of the ten directions—whether Daoist priests or nuns, or laypeople—none cultivate goodness. Those who leave the household life harbor jealousy and plot in secret; those who remain in the world are arrogant, lewd, murderous, and thieving. Except for those who transcend the world, there is not a single one who gives their whole heart. This concludes the explanation of the absence of goodness; what follows clarifies the presence of evil deeds.\n\nWithin this passage, there are three distinctions: first, the exposition of evil deeds; next, the identification of evil people; and finally, the enumeration of their evil manifestations. Here, we first explain the evil deeds. Why does the Heavenly Worthy speak thus of the degeneracy and falsity of later ages, the shallowness of human sentiment, and the way officials and commoners compete for glory and splendor, abandoning the rites of benevolence and righteousness, knowing only to greedily pursue wealth and rank, turning from the Dao to practice cunning, fathers and sons deceiving one another to their faces, rulers and ministers harboring different intentions, seizing every opportunity to endanger one another?\n\nAs a ruler, one’s perception and hearing are not clear, and they trust the words of powerful ministers. They exchange favors and use bribes to buy office; they dismiss and exile the loyal and upright, appointing the wicked and flattering. The noble remain in the wilderness while the base occupy the court. They form factions and groups, the wealthy and noble chasing one another, abandoning the orphaned and widowed, oppressing the poor. Their carriages, horses, and robes are adorned with extravagant splendor, and they fill the roads with their ostentatious procession. Those in power treat others as if they were nothing; the rich and poor are treated as different species. Those who hoard wealth are called noble, while the poor and pure are deemed base. Delighting in worldly affairs, is there even one who thinks of the Dao?\n\nThis concludes the exposition of evil deeds; what follows identifies the evil people. Such reckless and unrestrained individuals are all worldly fools. Though they may briefly enjoy ease, how could they be worthy of desire?",

      "translated_text": "Here concludes the identification of evil people; what follows describes their evil manifestations. The reason for this is that foolish people, being shallow and base, are invaded by malevolent spirits. The purpose of these words is to address the shallowness of fools, who cannot look ahead or behind, relying on their power and excess, acting with arrogance and extravagance, transgressing laws and norms, indulging their desires without restraint, and disregarding rites and regulations. The Great Dao is frugal, pure, and empty—it does not accept such individuals. Since the divine spirits have already distanced themselves, malevolent ghosts readily invade and harm them.\n\nThis concludes the general exposition of evil deeds; what follows elaborates on their consequences. This section is divided into three parts: first, doctrinal explanation; second, analogical explanation; and third, the synthesis of analogy. We begin with the doctrinal explanation.\n\nSome align with falsehood and turn from truth, though their punishment has yet to be meted out. Others embrace calamity and deception, forsaking the Dao to revere evil, praying to ghosts and spirits for blessings and protection. Yet the heavenly net is vast and wide—though its mesh is loose, nothing escapes. Though the reckoning of sins may be delayed, the retribution for misdeeds is clear. Here ends the doctrinal explanation; what follows is the analogical explanation.\n\nIt is like extinguishing the fire after the rice is cooked—how can it last long? Here ends the analogy; what follows synthesizes it. Though evil people may not yet face punishment, they are like lingering embers.\n\nThus far, we have enumerated and examined transgressions. What follows presents the method to depart from wrongdoing. This section is divided into three parts: first, clarifying that the Dao of Heaven is impartial and inevitably metes out rewards and punishments; second, explaining that to depart from wrongdoing, one must only cultivate goodness; and third, demonstrating the harm of evil karma and urging its abandonment.\n\nWithin the first part, there are five subdivisions: first, explaining that human nature delights in life and abhors death, yet people fail to cultivate goodness and distance themselves from evil; second, clarifying that the Dao of Heaven is just and its rewards and punishments are unerring; third, showing that calamities and blessings arise from karma, not power or influence; fourth, advising the worthy not to covet worldly glory; and fifth, lamenting that fools cannot comprehend this.\n\nWe begin by explaining that people delight in life and detest death. The Lady of Daoling once wished that life be valued—yet is it not so? Worldly fools cannot cultivate goodness or distance themselves from evil; they merely wish for peace, longevity, and to avoid premature death or misfortune. Whether noble or base, who does not desire this? Here ends the explanation of delighting in life and detesting death; what follows clarifies that rewards and punishments are certain.\n\nHeaven and Earth are just and impartial. Though retribution emerges from the unseen, the heavenly eye is bright and clear, perceiving even the most minute details. Rewards for goodness and punishments for evil are decisive and unerring, all arising from the unseen, without letting worldly people perceive it. Here ends the explanation of unerring rewards and punishments; what follows demonstrates that the arising of good and evil is inescapable.\n\nDisasters and misfortunes are not what the rich and noble seek or pray for, yet they cannot be averted. Blessings and calamities arrive unexpectedly: the poor desire them but they do not come, while the rich try to repel them but cannot. Here ends the explanation of good and evil arising from karma; what follows elucidates the principle of karmic retribution.\n\nCultivating goodness brings blessings, while doing evil invites disaster—how can one escape? Cultivating goodness summons blessings, while doing evil inevitably incurs calamity. Neither rank nor position can avert it, nor can gold or jade bribe it away. Here ends the explanation of karmic retribution; what follows advises the worthy not to covet worldly glory.\n\nThe poor and lowly need not forcibly seek wealth and nobility. Riches and honor are decreed by Heaven, glory arises from karma—do not exhaust your spirit or waste your thoughts in improper striving. It leads people to lose the Dao, become confused, and shorten their years. Here ends the advice against coveting worldly glory; what follows laments that fools cannot comprehend this.\n\nYet fools, seeing the wealthy and noble, wish to equal them, unaware that their own fate is ill and their bones inauspicious. Even if they attain such status, it will not be grand or enduring; their downfall is near, and ruin inevitable. Better to still the heart, practice non-action, and remain free of trouble.\n\nThus far, we have clarified the impartiality of the Dao of Heaven. What follows urges the cultivation of conduct to depart from wrongdoing. This section is divided into five parts: first, urging cultivation; second, urging the abandonment of evil; third, extolling the supremacy of scriptures to encourage devotion; fourth, explaining the differing paths of fools and the wise, and the compassion of sages; and fifth, concluding with an exhortation to transmit these teachings.\n\nWe begin by urging cultivation. If you seek to fulfill your wishes and desires, all will accord with the intentions of your heart. If you desire long life, enduring vision, and the joy of non-action, first receive and uphold the scriptures. Harmonize your heart and devote your intent, prepare a pure and solemn hall with a proper seat, place the celestial texts reverently, and offer incense and lamps. Practice with single-minded devotion, empty the heart, and contemplate the true. The Dao does not fail those who act—it calculates merit and fulfills wishes. Seven generations of ancestors receive blessings, and the living attain immortality. If you but practice diligently, the scriptures will not be in vain.\n\nIf you seek to fulfill your wishes and desires, do not rely on bribes, wealth, clever words, or offerings of food and drink. In these four matters, if you act as desired, simply contemplate the Dao and preserve the true, and blessings will come naturally. Here ends the urging of cultivation; what follows encourages the establishment of merit.\n\nIf you wish to create fields of blessings, there is no limit to the merit. If you desire to build merit and establish virtue to seek hidden protection, you may, according to your faith, offer alms, incense, and oil, exerting your utmost sincerity. The blessings from such clarity are boundless. Thus far, we have urged the establishment of merit and cultivation; what follows urges the abandonment of evil.\n\nIf you imitate worldly people, turn from the Dao, and pray to evil spirits, disaster will block your door. Do not turn from the Dao, belittle the true, or revere evil. Praying to ghosts a thousand times will bring no blessing—only disaster will block your door. Here ends the urging to abandon evil; what follows encourages the reception of scriptures.\n\nWithin the section on upholding scriptures, there are three parts: first, explaining the supremacy of scriptures to encourage devotion; second, elucidating the purpose of receiving scriptures; and third, urging the benefits of upholding scriptures. We begin by considering the reception of scriptures.",

Yet when weighing the efficacy of virtuous practice, we find that no act of merit, no offering sown in fields of blessing, can compare to the reception and upholding of this scripture—even a single sentence, a single verse.\n\nThus far, we have extolled the supremacy of the scriptures to encourage devotion; below, we elucidate their purpose. Why is this so? This scripture is the path by which the perfected beings of the ten directions attain the Dao. It is the parent of all sages, the source from which all virtues arise, the way by which all who attain the Dao and achieve perfection must tread.\n\nNext, we expound the benefits of upholding the scriptures. If there be a virtuous man or woman who awakens the natural intent of the Dao and receives and upholds this scripture, what blessing will not be theirs? What goodness will not follow?\n\nThus far, we have weighed the merit of virtuous deeds and urged the benefits of upholding the scriptures. Below, we lament the divergence between the wise and the foolish in their choices. Alas! People differ in lifespan, and minds differ in acuity. Some are swift, some slow; some minds are bright, others dim. The wise exert themselves tirelessly, ever fearing they fall short; the foolish turn away and slander, their thoughts as distant as Mount Tai. How can such disparity be resolved?\n\nHere ends the lament of the sage; below, we urge the transmission of the teachings. Lord Dao commanded: \"You, Dao-ling, shall transmit this scripture to later disciples, guiding them into the gate of the Dao.\" When the Most High entrusted the Heavenly Master with the transmission of this scripture to later learners, there were signs of their destined union with the perfected. Whether in broad strokes or fine detail, one must weigh the essentials, that the filth of the heart may be cleansed and all may return to the chamber of the Dao.\n\nThus far, we have recounted past errors and urged their abandonment. What follows is the third section, which clarifies the harm of evil deeds and urges repentance. Within this section, there are two parts: first, the Heavenly Master’s inquiry, and second, the Dao Lord’s response.\n\nThe first part is further divided: first, the assembly of immortals present at the reception of the Dharma, and second, the circumstances of the inquiry. We begin with the immortals gathered at the time of the Dharma’s reception.\n\nAt that time, Dao-ling received the Dharma. All the great sages, Brahma-heaven Daoists, perfected beings of wondrous conduct, and envoys of the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions—seven hundred million in all—gathered before the Dao to praise Dao-ling. Amidst the assembly, Dao-ling, adorned in ritual vestments, stood with hands clasped before the Dao and inquired about the causes of calamity and fortune.\n\nDao-ling said: \"I observe that among all who revere the Dao and uphold the Dharma, some encounter disasters, sudden illnesses, or violent deaths; some face official summons, slander, or misfortune; their endeavors fail, their desires go unfulfilled. I do not know whether such afflictions arise from past karmic causes or present transgressions. I humbly beseech your illumination to clarify what remains obscure.\"\n\nThe Venerable Lord replied: \"Such misfortunes arise from human wickedness, and they are also the result of past lives. Why is this so? Though people revere the Dao, their devotion is not earnest. Though they know the Dao is supreme and wish to follow it, their conduct and nature remain no different from the vulgar. They do not cast aside deceit and falsehood, yet seek to approach the true and perfected with such impurity—this can never succeed. The true and the deceitful are as incompatible as thieves and watchful guards. Though they profess to follow the great Dao, they also pray to evil spirits, their hearts wavering between two paths, thus aligning themselves with the false. Such people, though nominally followers of the Dao, hope for its protection, yet the Dao does not accept them. Clinging to demonic influences, they claim allegiance to the Dao. When disaster, illness, misfortune, or peril strike, they expect the Dao to shield them, yet the Dao does not save them. Demonic spirits and malevolent ghosts assail them, and the Dao does not intervene. Their bodies meet death, their families face ruin. Yet these foolish and vulgar people fail to awaken, turning instead to resentment, declaring the Dao powerless. Even if they do not speak it aloud, their hearts harbor bitterness and reproach.\"",

Why do they not purify their hearts and renew themselves here and now? The wise hold fast to true faith, cultivating and upholding the scriptures and precepts.\n\nThe Great Dao is most revered, lofty and without peer, boundless and all-encompassing, enfolding heaven and earth. It governs the host of spirits, gives life to the myriad things—from the soaring and creeping to all creatures that breathe—all are brought forth by the Dao.

It grasps the pivot of heaven’s mechanism, commands the myriad spirits, precedes all that is prior, and exhausts all that is boundless.\n\nHumans dwell within it, their years and lives fleeting as the blink of an eye. All things are perfected by the Dao, all things arise from the Dao. It pities and cherishes all beings as a mother grieves for her child. Thus, it sets forth the laws for humanity, bidding them cultivate the Dao and practice its ways.

      "translated_text": "When the Heavenly Master received the Daoist teachings, the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, Daoist masters, Perfected Ones, and Transcendent Lords of wondrous realms dispatched envoys to offer praise. Some rode clouds or harnessed the sun, steering chariots upon celestial terraces—seven hundred billion in all, gathered beneath the Ascending Mystery Seat. Once this assembly had taken their places, the proceedings turned to the sequence of inquiries below.\n\nWithin this discourse, two distinctions are made: first, the effect is raised to trace its cause; next, the cause is examined to clarify its effect. The initial inquiry concerns the cause.\n\nDao-ling observed that those who devotedly follow the Dao and its precepts often fail to attain their desires. Though the world’s people uphold the Dao and its laws, and should be shielded by sacred power, why do they so frequently encounter misfortune, calamity, and peril—even untimely death? Some succumb to sudden illness, others to unjust imprisonment; their endeavors fail, and nothing prospers. This concludes the inquiry into effects to trace their causes. Next, the cause is examined to clarify the effect.\n\nIt remains unclear what offenses these individuals have committed. Are their sufferings the result of present transgressions or karmic retribution from past lives? With this question posed, the Most High Lord Lao begins His response.\n\nWithin His answer, prose and verse intermingle. The prose is divided into three main sections: first, the enumeration of evil deeds; second, the exhortation to abandon evil; and third, the encouragement to cultivate the Dao. The first section is further divided into two parts: first, the exposition of evil’s origins, and second, the explanation of evil’s manifestations.\n\nNow addressing the first part, Lord Lao replies: Such afflictions arise from human wickedness, rooted in past lives. These troubled souls fall into two categories: those who bring suffering upon themselves, and those upon whom past-life misfortunes descend.\n\nHaving outlined the origins of evil, the text proceeds to explain its manifestations. Why do those who follow the Dao with insufficient diligence fail to perceive its rewards? Initially, they may grow resentful, wavering in their commitment, lacking sincerity. Their devotion flickers, their resolve falters. Though they hear of the Dao’s exalted nature and rejoice in its pursuit, they have not shed worldly ways; their hearts remain tainted by deceit. How can they attain the true Dao while clinging to falsehood? When the false encounters the true, it is like a thief meeting a watchful guard. Because their hearts are not steadfast, Heaven allows evil to take hold. As they cling to corrupt spirits, the true Dao withholds its protection. Even when disaster or illness strikes, no aid is granted; the corrupt spirits prevail, leading to bodily death and the ruin of their households. Yet the foolish, worldly masses remain oblivious, even declaring the Dao powerless and harboring resentment.\n\nThis concludes the exposition of evil deeds; what follows is the exhortation to repent. Why do these individuals not rectify their conduct while repentance is still possible? Why do they not refine their precepts and transform their hearts? Day by day, they steep themselves in corruption. Heaven’s net is vast and wide-meshed, yet nothing escapes it; rewards for good and punishments for evil are meted out without exception. Why do you persist in perversity? If you cannot reflect on your transgressions and make amends, your life will end in the dark depths of evil destinies—what use will regret be then?\n\nHaving urged repentance, the text next exhorts the abandonment of evil. How pitiable are the foolish masses, who persist in error to this extent! The Great Sage, in boundless compassion, grieves for their plight. How can they bear to revere falsehood and belittle the Dao, refusing to uphold the precepts and cultivate truth? Why not wash away wickedness and renew yourselves with virtuous deeds?\n\nHaving enumerated evil and urged its abandonment, the text turns to the Dao to encourage its cultivation. This section is divided into four parts: first, the Dao’s exalted nature demands cultivation; second, the Dao’s power demands cultivation; third, the Dao’s creative capacity demands cultivation; and fourth, the Dao’s benefits demand its pursuit.\n\nFirst, the Dao’s exalted nature: The worthy must rectify their hearts, uphold the scriptures and precepts, for the Great Dao is most revered—all things arise from it. The wise and discerning should align their hearts, receive the great scriptures, and diligently cultivate the supreme Dao. The Dao’s laws are sublime and beyond comprehension. Heaven and Earth endure by its grace; the myriad beings flourish through its nurture. Vast, it encompasses all without limit; subtle, it enters the infinitesimal. Given the Dao’s lofty and wondrous nature, why do the worthy not cultivate and uphold it?\n\nNext, the Dao’s power: The Dao’s numinous might extends everywhere, even to the boundless. Its divine power summons all, averts all, subdues all. It grasps the celestial mechanisms, commands all spirits. It precedes all precedence, exhausts all limits. This concludes the explanation of the Dao’s power.\n\nNext, the Dao’s creative capacity: Though human lifespans are fleeting, one must cultivate the Dao and practice its ways. Though lives vary in length, all exist within the Dao’s creation. The Great Dao, like a mother grieving for her child, earnestly expounds the scriptures and precepts, urging all to cultivate the Dao and study immortality.\n\nHaving explained the Dao’s benefits, the text proceeds to assess merit and conduct. Those whose merit is supreme ascend as immortals. This illustrates how the depth of one’s merit determines the measure of one’s reward—yet people remain unaware, persisting in evil without reform, sinking together into ruin, with no hope of return. The Great Sage, moved by compassion, weeps for them and leaves behind scriptures and precepts, exhorting them to abandon wickedness.\n\nThis concludes the prose; what follows are the verses. The verses are divided into three parts: first, a single line on the causes of evil; next, a single line on the effects of evil; and finally, a single line exhorting the cultivation of the Dao.\n\nFirst, the causes of evil:\nIn past lives, they sowed evil seeds,\nIn this life, they accumulate no pure fragrance.\nClinging to the false while professing the Dao,\nThey invite misfortune and ill fate.\n\nThis concludes the verse on evil’s causes; next, the verse on evil’s effects:\nTrue qi lends no strength,\nWhile evil brings only disaster.\nWhen the Three Calamities arrive as one,\nTheir families are ruined, their bodies perish.\nSeven generations of ancestors sink into the Three Bureaus,\nTheir souls and spirits dragged away.\nThey tread upon the Mountain of Knives,\nTheir hands wounded by the Forest of Swords.\nAbove and below, the Five Courts of Suffering,\nBlood flows, festering into sores.\nFor ten thousand kalpas, no pardon is granted,\nAs they revolve through the Five Paths’ grounds.",

They follow their hearts’ desires, acting with arrogance and excess—how could they ever contemplate the Dao?\n\nWhen people constantly contemplate the Dao, the Dao also contemplates them.\nPeople are like fish, the Dao like water—\nFish live when they obtain water, and die when they lose it.\nIf the qi of the Dao does not reside within,\nThe human body becomes empty;\nWhen the body is empty, how can it endure for long?\nThe key lies in diligent progress, preserving mindfulness of the utmost truth.\n\nI address all worthy ones: If you wish to preserve your life, transcend the mortal form, attain the Dao, and achieve true perfection, you should revere and receive *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Ascending Mystery and the Inner Teachings of the True One*. You must purify your hearts, eliminate past transgressions, reform and cultivate future goodness, and align with the scriptural laws.\n\nThose who can do this accord with the intent of the Supreme Orthodox and True Dao.\n\nAll who follow the Dao must eliminate transgressions, establish merit, reflect on their sins, and make amends for their faults.\n\nIf, before encountering the scriptural laws, you have killed with your own hands, you should save and revive one person on the verge of death to atone for it.\nOnce the transgression is eliminated, you also gain the merit of saving a life.\n\nIf you have committed robbery or theft, taking others’ property, after receiving the Dharma, you should vow with heart and mouth, using your private wealth to bestow alms upon the poor and establish meritorious deeds.\nOnce the debt is resolved, you also gain the reward of bestowing kindness.\n\nIf you have slandered those superior to yourself with your words, falsely accused and harmed the worthy and good, or wrongly accused the innocent, you should promote and elevate the worthy to make amends.\nOnce the burden is settled, you also gain the recompense of advancing the virtuous.\n\nTurning misfortune into fortune—these are the essential words.\n\nThus, when the practice of the Dao is established, your words and commands must be treasured.\nWhen you see others making mistakes, admonish and exhort one another, propagate the scriptural Dharma, and universally deliver gods and humans.\nLet all men and women obtain the benefits of the Dharma.\nSuch meritorious rewards are immeasurable.\n\nDo not claim the Dao is formless and act with arrogance and disdain. Instead, devote yourself to diligent cultivation, maintaining purity day and night.\nIf you see people suffering from illness, you should save and deliver them.\nDo not deceive the foolish with cunning, exploit power to feign deceit, rely on ghosts and spirits to intimidate the people, or seize others’ property.\nDo not boast of minor knowledge, claim greatness, belittle the foolish and lowly, or slander one another.\nDo not engage in frivolous discussions, pointing out the faults of the worthy.\nDo not harbor private greed and malice, respecting the noble while shaming the humble, favoring the rich while abandoning the poor, or feigning generosity for personal gain.\nDo not seek blessings by following personal desires, considering it benevolence.\nThe Dao will never comply, ghosts will not serve you, and if you destroy the true Dharma, you will suffer the consequences yourself.\n\nStrive to seek those of like mind, befriend those of the same Dharma.\n\nIf men and women cannot read or write, simply receive the scriptural Dharma, devote your hearts to the Dao, listen to the recitation of scriptures and precepts, gather in the fasting hall, and attentively receive without forgetting.\nYou may also burn incense in the hall, sit in purity, maintaining separation between men and women, with solemn and proper demeanor. Calm your spirits, concentrate your minds, and listen clearly to the sounds of the Dharma.\nDo not speak frivolously, lean or slouch improperly.\nDo not let your minds wander to other thoughts, grow lazy, or fall asleep. Do not face each other, chattering noisily, exhausting your bodies with self-imposed labor, suffering without gain.\n\nIf you can be reverent and solemn according to the Dharma, you will receive boundless blessings. The immortal officials who attend the scriptures will naturally come to protect you, ensuring you remain free from disaster and attain the Dao to ascend to heaven.\n\nThen, the Most High Lord Lao spoke in verse:\n\nRevere emptiness and honor the Great Vehicle,\nSevering both form and desire.\nThe essentials arise from diligent progress,\nLeaving no place for demonic forces to array.\nTransform misfortune by cultivating virtuous conduct,\nAnd past debts naturally vanish.\nMerit accumulates and renews daily,\nTranscending the mundane with distinction.\nWords and commands must be treasured and employed,\nGreat merit is thereby established.\nThere are foolish and evil people in the world\nWho invoke names and establish ghostly teachings.\nThey practice private deceit in public conduct,\nA thousand words yield not a single effect.\nIndulging their hearts in demonic affairs,\nThey bring upon themselves great trials.\nUnknowing of the source of their transgressions,\nThey suddenly meet with ruin and violence.\nTheir souls are imprisoned in the courts of Fengdu,\nWhere pain and poison arrive in full.\nYet there are those who delight in the Dharma,\nEntrusting their faith to causes and conditions.\nThough they may not understand written words,\nTheir hearts recognize the intent within.\nEmpty their minds of perverse thoughts,\nListening to the recitation of thousands of words.\nDevoting their hearts, they attain the Dao,\nThus becoming Supreme Perfected Ones.\nSimply by upholding and contemplating,\nTheir merit naturally fills the heavens.\n\nAll good men,\nFocus your minds and listen to my scripture.\nDo not engage in idle discussions,\nOr act without sincerity.\nFirst, it disrupts the supreme teachings;\nSecond, it exhausts the body.\nExhausting the body brings self-suffering,\nAnd the reward for love is not wisdom.\nYou should be reverent and solemn,\nDo not slight the divine spirits.\nWhen you see those who diligently progress,\nThey ascend as immortals to fill heavenly offices.\nSoaring beyond the Brahma realms,\nTheir learning is not at all difficult.\nWhy cling to the impurities of the world,\nAnd not aspire to transcend form and spirit?\n\n---",

faces bereft of human semblance,\nBegging among the hungry ghosts.\nHeaven’s punishments are ever applied,\nEnduring trials through kalpas unending.\nThis comes from failing to accumulate goodness,\nSlandering and harming the true and worthy.\nRetribution arrives in an instant,\nYet fools insist it is not so.\nIf one does not reform oneself,\nThey alone fall to heaven’s ruin.\n\nFar better to cultivate the great Dao,\nJoining the host of Perfected Ones.\nIn this world, men and women alike\nAll turn from the true and upright,\nUnable to uphold precepts or scriptures,\nOnly craving glory, wealth, and honor,\nIndulging in wine and meat to please their hearts,\nLetting wealth and desire fill their minds.\nThey know only excess, pride, and extravagance—\nNot one among them thinks of the Dao.\n\nThis first urges reform of evil,\nNext urges the keeping of mindfulness.\nThere is a dharma with parable,\nThat people may always think of the Dao,\nAnd the Dao will think of them in return.\nIf one can think of the Dao,\nHow could the Dao not think of them?\nThe analogy is made clear:\nPeople are like fish within water—\nWhen the water is lost, they die.\nThus the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says:\nPeople are within the Dao, the Dao within people;\nFish are within water, water within fish.\nWhen the Dao departs, people die;\nWhen water dries, the fish’s life ends.\nThis is the meaning.\nBelow, the analogy is applied\nTo urge the cultivation of the Dao.\nWhen the Dao’s qi does not abide,\nThe human body becomes empty.\nIf one maintains mindfulness of the utmost truth,\nThe Dao’s qi will not depart,\nAnd the body will not become empty.\nIf the body is empty,\nHow can it endure long?\nOne must diligently cultivate the supreme Dao,\nMaintaining mindfulness of the utmost truth.\n\nThis urges reform of evil and keeping of mindfulness.\nNext, it urges upholding scriptures to eliminate transgressions.\nThe text is divided into three parts:\nFirst, urging the upholding of scriptures;\nSecond, urging the elimination of transgressions;\nThird, clarifying attainment of the Dao.\nFirst, urging the scriptures:\nIt tells all worthy ones,\nIf you wish to preserve life and transcend the self,\nYou must revere the *True One Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.\nThe Dao tells the worthy:\nIf you desire life, transcendence, and attainment of the Dao,\nYou must honor and receive the *True One Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.\nIts power will sustain you,\nAnd you will naturally attain the Dao.\n\nThis urges the receiving of scriptures.\nNext, urging the elimination of transgressions:\nAll should purify their hearts\nTo accord with the scripture’s dharma.\nThey must wash away filth,\nReflect on their faults, and make amends,\nFollowing only the Dao,\nDevoting themselves only to the dharma.\n\nThis urges the elimination of transgressions.\nBelow, it clarifies attainment of the Dao:\nThose who can do this\nAccord with the intent of the supreme true Dao.\nIf one follows the Dao without deviation,\nThey merge with the utmost principle.\nThus the *Daoist Scripture* says:\nThose who are one with the Dao,\nThe Dao also attains them.\nThis is the meaning.\n\nThe above urges reform of transgressions.\nBelow, it urges the establishment of meritorious deeds.\nWithin the section on establishing merit,\nThere are five distinctions:\nFirst, urging the ransoming of lives;\nSecond, urging almsgiving;\nThird, urging the promotion of the worthy;\nFourth, clarifying the benefits of establishing merit;\nFifth, concluding exhortations.\nFirst, urging the ransoming of lives:\nAll who would embody the Dao\nMust eliminate transgressions and establish merit,\nEven gaining the merit of reviving others.\nAll who wish to embody the Dao\nMust eliminate transgressions and establish merit.\nIf before upholding scriptures and precepts,\nThey personally committed killing,\nThey should save those on the verge of death\nTo make amends for past faults.\nThus, their karmic debts are erased,\nAnd they also gain the blessing of aiding others.\n\nThis urges the ransoming of lives.\nNext, urging almsgiving:\nIf they once robbed others of their wealth,\nThey should also gain the reward of bestowing kindness.\nIf before hearing the scriptures’ dharma,\nThey plundered others’ possessions,\nThey should now vow in heart and word,\nReflect on their faults, and make amends.\nWith their own private wealth,\nThey should bestow alms upon the poor,\nPlanting seeds in the field of blessings,\nEstablishing merit and virtue.\nThus, their past debts are settled,\nAnd they also gain the merit of bestowing kindness.\n\nThis urges almsgiving.\nNext, urging the promotion of the worthy:\nIf they once slandered those superior to themselves,\nThey should also gain the reward of promoting the worthy.\nIf they ever slandered those superior to themselves,\nPraised the unworthy, or defamed the innocent,\nEnvying and resenting the noble,\nThey should now recommend and elevate the worthy,\nExtolling those of great learning.\nThus, their past debts are erased,\nAnd they also gain the reward of promoting the worthy.\n\nBelow, clarifying the benefits of establishing merit,\nTurning misfortune into blessing:\nThese are true and essential words—\nTheir merit is immeasurable.\nIt urges turning from evil thoughts\nTo cultivate blessings and goodness.\nWhen the Dao’s practice is established,\nIts words must be treasured.\nIf one sees others’ faults,\nThey should expound the scriptures and precepts,\nEnabling all—men and women alike—\nTo receive the dharma’s benefits.\nSuch merit is towering,\nBoundless and immeasurable.\n\nThis clarifies the benefits.\nBelow, it sets forth admonitions and exhortations:\nDo not think the Dao formless and become arrogant,\nBut diligently cultivate with reverence,\nMaintaining purity of heart day and night.\n\nThe above urges the cultivation of goodness and establishment of merit.\nBelow, it properly urges the abandonment of transgressions.\nThere are two distinctions:\nFirst, urging reform of transgressions;\nSecond, urging cultivation of goodness.\nFirst, urging reform of transgressions:\nIf one sees people suffering from illness,\nThey should save and deliver them.\nSeeing others in distress,\nAssist them in performing blessings.\nWith a mind to save and deliver,\nThey may attain peace and stability.\nDo not use cunning to deceive the foolish,\nRelying on spirits and ghosts to frighten the world,\nExtorting others’ wealth.\nThough possessing some spiritual insight,\nDo not manipulate the worthy,\nDisdain the lowly,\nSlander one another,\nRespect the noble and shame the humble,\nDelight in wealth and abandon the poor,\nHold love and hatred in duality,\nDeceive with false expectations,\nRefuse to follow others’ sentiments to bestow kindness,\nOr indulge desires and drive others away.\nCarefully consider:\nEven spirits and ghosts will not comply,\nAnd in the true dharma, there is truly no efficacy.\nInstead, one’s own body will suffer calamity.\n\nThis urges reform of transgressions.\nNext, urging cultivation of the Dao:\nThose of like aspiration should seek one another,\nThose of like dharma should befriend one another.\nThey must honor and receive the great scriptures,\nDevoting their hearts to delighting in the Dao.\nIf the dharma’s teachings are not yet clear,\nThey should consult those who understand,\nListening and reciting with careful reception,\nNot allowing forgetfulness.\nThey must also maintain solemn dignity,\nCalming the spirit and aligning the body,\nNot letting the mind wander to other thoughts,\nOr indulge in drowsiness and slumber,\nEngaging in idle chatter face to

      "translated_text": "Here follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis concludes the urging to cultivate and depart from transgressions; below clarifies the benefits gained.\n\nIf one can be reverently attentive according to the dharma, then boundless blessings will be received, even to the point of attaining the Dao and ascending to heaven. If one can be reverently attentive according to the dharma, then immeasurable blessings will be received, and the immortal officials who attend the scriptures will naturally come to protect them. Not only will they be free from calamity for the remainder of their lives, but they will even ascend to the heavenly halls.\n\nThe preceding long prose passage concludes here. From this point onward, verses are recited to urge the establishment of merit.\n\nWithin the verses, there are divisions: first, two and a half lines praise the establishment of merit and the benefits gained.\n\n*\"In the world there are the foolish and ignorant...\"* (two and a half lines) describe the harm of evil conduct.\n\n*\"Those who delight in the dharma...\"* (five lines) urge the upholding of the scriptures.\n\n*\"Seeing those who are diligent...\"* (five and a half lines) present goodness in contrast to evil, urging choice between them.\n\nNow, first recite the upholding of the scriptures:\n\n**Honoring the Void, revering the Great Vehicle—**\n**Even demons dare not list their faults.**\n\nHonor the Void and uphold the Great Dharma.\nCut off all glory and desire, and eliminate them entirely.\nOnce diligence arises within the heart,\nWhat external demon would dare to enumerate their transgressions?\n\nThis concludes the urging to establish merit; below clarifies the benefits.\n\n**Transforming misfortune through cultivating virtue—**\n**Great merit is thereby accomplished.**\n\nIf one can abandon coarse thoughts and reform to cultivate good conduct,\nThen past transgressions and debts will naturally dissipate like clouds.\nVirtue and power tower majestically, advancing with each passing day.\nTranscending the mundane, one ascends lightly,\nUtterly distinct from the world.\nPeople must follow this great merit,\nFor it is thereby accomplished.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the benefits of establishing merit; next clarifies the harm of evil conduct.\n\n*\"In the world there are foolish people...\"*\nWho invoke names to establish ghostly teachings,\nPrivately deceiving yet openly practicing them—\nTen thousand words, not one is true.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of evil conduct; next clarifies the losses incurred.\n\n**Following the heart to perform demonic deeds—**\n**Punishment and suffering arrive thus.**\n\nIndulging one’s foolish nature to perform demonic deeds,\nCorruption fills and guilt is certain.\nCalamity and torment come of their own accord.\nUnaware of the day of death’s approach,\nSuddenly, brutal violence befalls.\nThe soul is imprisoned in the ghostly courts of Fengdu,\nWhere pain and poison reach their peak.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the harm of evil conduct. Below urges the cultivation of the scriptural dharma.\n\nThe text is divided into two parts: first, verses praising those who believe in the dharma; then, verses praising those who listen and receive it.\n\nFirst, recite those who practice the dharma:\n\n**Those who must delight in the dharma,**\n**Respect and believe, taking goodness as their cause.**\nThough they may not understand the written word,\nTheir hearts remain sincere and earnest.\nThey set aside right and wrong,\nListening to and reciting the scriptural passages.\n\nThis clarifies belief in the dharma; below clarifies the benefits gained.\n\n**Devoting the heart, the Dao is attained—**\n**Virtue and power naturally fill the heavens.**\n\nDevoting the heart, one attains the immortal Dao,\nAnd accomplishes the supreme, perfect truth.\nSimply by receiving and upholding the wondrous scriptures,\nVirtue and power naturally become vast.\n\nThe preceding verses on those who believe and receive conclude here. Below recite those who listen to the dharma:\n\n**All good men and women,**\n**Focus your hearts to listen to my scripture.**\nDo not face one another with idle chatter,\nNor harbor thoughts of confusion.\nFirst, this disturbs the supreme teachings;\nSecond, it wearies your bodies.\nWearying the body is but self-inflicted toil,\nLater receiving the retribution of dullness.\nIt is better to honor and serve the scriptural Dao,\nAnd never again slight the divine spirits.\n\nThe preceding urging to uphold the scriptures concludes here. Below presents goodness in contrast to evil to urge choice between them.\n\nThe text is divided into two: first, presenting good and evil to urge choice; then, urging cultivation of the Dao to clarify the benefits gained.\n\nThe first part is further divided: first, one line presents goodness to urge its adoption; then, five lines present evil to urge its abandonment.\n\nFirst, urging the adoption of goodness:\n\n**Seeing those who are diligent—**\n**Learning is thus not at all difficult.**\n\nSeeing those who are diligent,\nAbandoning the secular to cultivate the scriptural Dao,\nThey will surely attain immortality and transcend the world.\nThen, they will fill the heavenly offices,\nAscending high and soaring beyond the mundane,\nFlying beyond the bounds of the Brahma realms.\nThrough cultivation and learning, this is attained—\nTruly, it is not difficult.\n\nThis concludes the urging to adopt goodness; below urges the abandonment of evil.\n\n**Why cling to the impure and beautiful?**\n**Alone, you will fall to heavenly ruin.**\n\nThis laments that people of this age are submerged in worldly dust,\nNot aspiring to ascend in spirit and soar lightly,\nOr wander and feast in the mysterious capital.\nInstead, they will be bound to the northern gate,\nRevolving through the five destinies,\nWailing beside cauldrons of boiling water,\nShrieking atop blades and swords.\nTheir faces and bodies endure hardship,\nScorched by hunger and cold.\nBegging for food, they find no place to turn.\nHeavenly punishments are fully applied,\nTheir bodies suffer torment,\nFor kalpas upon kalpas, through countless years.\nAll because they slandered the worthy and good,\nDisbelieved in past lives,\nPersisted in evil without reform,\nAnd thus brought about their own heavenly ruin.\n\nThis concludes the urging to adopt goodness and abandon evil. Below urges cultivation of the Dao:\n\n**Nothing compares to cultivating the great Dao—**\n**The host of sages will gather with you.**\n\nNothing compares to cultivating the scriptures and propagating the Dao,\nIlluminating the dharma gate,\nSo that you may befriend the host of perfected immortals.\n\nThe preceding verses urging the establishment of merit conclude here. Below summarizes the urging to cultivate goodness and the benefits gained.\n\nThe text is divided into two: first, clarifying the benefits of self-cultivation; then, urging reverence and secrecy.\n\nAfter Laozi finished reciting the verses, he addressed Daoling, saying:\n\"In times past, through countless kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, in boundless and limitless eras, I cultivated this chapter, chanting its verses, practicing its rituals, and playing with its words, thereby attaining my present retribution. Its purport is subtle and profound, the mystery within the mystery. Now I tell you this in earnest—revere it well, and do not reveal it to those who lack faith.\"",

      "translated_text": "Should any harbor doubt or slander, their lineage shall be extinguished to the last.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: \"In kalpas past beyond count, I cultivated these scriptural verses, chanting their meaning, practicing their rites with diligent devotion, and thus attained the supreme Dao-fruit of this day. Know that the purport of this scripture is profound and far-reaching, the mystery within the mystery.\"\n\nHere concludes the exposition of its benefits; below urges reverence and secrecy. Now I earnestly tell you—hold it in deepest respect, for the consequences of transgression extend to the annihilation of one’s lineage. This great scripture I now proclaim to you; receive it with utmost care, cherish the Dao with fervent devotion, and transmit it no further. Should others doubt or revile it, their lineage shall be extinguished.\n\nHere ends the urging to establish meritorious deeds. Below begins the fourth major section of the preceding text, which exhorts the method of scripture cultivation, comprising both prose and verse. Within the prose, there are two divisions: first, presenting the dual conditions of good and evil to illustrate human life and destiny; then, setting forth the scriptural precepts to urge cultivation. The first division is further divided into two: first, the evils of life and death; then, the matters of karmic retribution. Within the former, there are four parts: first, the ignorance of the worldly; second, the shared desire for evil; third, the failure to attain one’s desires; fourth, the concluding exhortation to relinquish. We begin with the ignorance of the worldly.\n\nLord Lao addressed Daoling, saying: \"Among the ten thousand things, humans are the most noble. Yet dwelling between Heaven and Earth, all know the day of their birth but not the day of their death. Whether good or evil, wealthy or poor, each wishes for long life—who desires an early demise? Death is what humans do not delight in, yet how can any escape it? Only by not being born can one avoid this difficulty. Yet even this class has its causes and conditions: those who cultivate goodness receive goodness, and their spirits become good; those who commit evil receive evil, and their spirits become evil. Thus, half reside in the halls of my Dao, and half in demonic hells. It is like an echo—none fails to receive a response.\n\nHuman lifespan is ordained by the Void. The Void does not speak, so sages were established. Sages concealed their forms, leaving behind scriptures and precepts. These scriptures and precepts are called the Dao. They urge people to do good, teaching them to cultivate life, first to eliminate transgressions, second to attain immortality. Not only does one avoid death, but one becomes a perfected immortal. Such blessings cannot be obtained by seeking wealth or status, nor by offerings of wine and meat to spirits. They arise solely from the reverent observance of scriptures and precepts by worthy Daoists through diligent practice. First suffering, then reward—its response is clear as day.\n\nOf all that Heaven and Earth generate, humans are the most noble. Yet the foolish, clouded by delusion, lack clear wisdom. They know only the day of their birth and their wealth or rank, not the hour of their death.\"\n\nHere concludes the exposition of worldly ignorance; next, the shared desires of high and low.\n\n\"Whether good or evil, all share the same aspirations: to be wealthy, noble, and long-lived. Who would wish for poverty and an early death?\"\n\nHere concludes the exposition of shared desires for evil; next, the failure to attain one’s desires.\n\n\"Death is what humans do not delight in, yet how can any escape it? The body perishes, the soul departs—all abhor this, yet who can avoid it?\"\n\nBelow, the concluding exhortation: only by not being born can one avoid this. Though one may seek to avoid death, it is better still not to be born. Refine the body and return to the True—what affliction remains?\n\nHere concludes the exposition of the joys and sorrows of life and death to urge relinquishment; below, the matters of karmic retribution.\n\n\"Yet even this class has its causes and conditions—good and evil actions differ, and so do their karmic retributions. Thus, as spirits, their fates diverge, some ascending, some sinking. It is like an echo responding to a call, or a seed yielding its fruit.\"\n\nThis presents the causes and conditions of good and evil to awaken understanding. Below, the proper exposition of scriptural methods to urge cultivation. Within this section, there are three divisions: first, presenting the scriptures to urge; second, clarifying the benefits of the scriptures; third, explaining the methods of upholding the scriptures. We begin with presenting the scriptures to urge.\n\n\"Human life is ordained by the Void, so sages were established to expound scriptures and precepts. These scriptures and precepts are the Dao itself. Those who propagate the Dharma thereby attain the True Dao.\"\n\nHere concludes the presentation of the scriptures to urge; next, the benefits of cultivating the scriptures.\n\n\"Urging people to do good and teaching them to cultivate life—those who uphold the scriptures prolong their years. Not only do they avoid death, but they attain the True Dao and become immortals.\"\n\nHere concludes the exposition of the benefits of upholding the scriptures; below, the methods of cultivation.\n\n\"Such blessings cannot be obtained by seeking wealth or status, nor by offerings to spirits. Only through upholding the scriptures, observing the precepts, and enduring hardship in self-cultivation does the reward become as radiant as the sun and moon.\"\n\nHere concludes the prose on upholding the scriptures; below, verses exhort the same. Within this section, there are two parts: first, five lines urging the abandonment of evil to heed the scriptures—*Why not diligently ascend the Dao?*; then, one and a half lines urging diligent devotion to reform the Dao. The first part is further divided into three: first, the ignorance of the worldly; second, the divergent fates of ascent and descent; third, the exhortation to the scriptural Dharma.\n\nThus, Lord Lao spoke in verse:\n\n\"Humans are the most noble,\nYet take no joy in the Dharma’s splendor.\nLife and death follow their course,\nNone know where they shall go.\nIn darkness they seek without knowing,\nOnly at retribution’s hour do they awaken.\nThe wicked enter the three torments,\nThe good obtain great mercy.\nIf one accords with the True,\nHear the scriptures, contemplate goodness.\nDo not feign deafness and blindness,\nHearing the Dharma yet pretending folly.\nI pity all heavenly and mortal beings,\nThus I leave these supreme words,\nThe great Dharma for humanity,\nThe excellent physician for the world.\"",
      "overlap_context": " secrecy.\n\nAfter Laozi finished reciting the verses, he addressed Daoling, saying:\n\"In times past, through countless kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, in boundless and limitless eras, I cultivated this chapter, chanting its verses, practicing its rituals, and playing with its words, thereby attaining my present retribution. Its purport is subtle and profound, the mystery within the mystery. Now I tell you this in earnest—revere it well, and do not reveal it to those who lack faith.\"",

foundation of goodness.\nThrough苦行 one obtains sweet reward,\nNaturally ascending the Mystic Terrace.\n\nThe preceding verses admonish the ignorance of the worldly,\nThat humans are most noble,\nYet only at retribution’s hour do they awaken.\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nOnly humans are noble—\nWhy not diligently cultivate the scriptures,\nDelighting in purity and splendor?\nInstead, they surrender to fate, unaware of life and death’s course,\nWandering in endless darkness,\nOnly realizing at retribution’s hour.\n\nThis concludes the exposition on the ignorance of the worldly.\nNext, it distinguishes the divergent fates of ascent and descent:\nThe wicked enter the three torments,\nThe good obtain great mercy.\nThe wicked descend into hell,\nWhere body and soul suffer thrice daily;\nThe good ascend to heaven,\nWhere the Great Sage, in compassion, welcomes and guides them.\n\nThis concludes the distinction of divergent fates.\nNext, it exhorts listening to the Dharma:\nIf

second major section,\nWhich urges adherence to the Five Precepts.\nWithin this section, there are both prose and verse.\nIn the prose, five distinctions are made:\nFirst, citing evil to urge its abandonment;\nSecond, citing the precepts to urge cultivation;\nThird, clarifying the benefits of upholding the precepts;\nFourth, clarifying the losses of transgressors;\nFifth, exhorting secrecy and caution.\n\nFirst, urging the abandonment of evil:\nThe Dao states: Sensual desire ruins affairs—\nIt must not be indulged.\nYet all in the world, wise or foolish, noble or base, share the same desires.\nOnly Daoists can hold fast to their resolve,\nFirmly upholding the teachings and precepts,\nRestraining themselves,\nIn conduct and movement, their hearts never inclining toward deviance.\nAmidst love and desire,\nThey never transgress even once.\nWhen they see beauty, profit, glory, or dazzling splendor,\nThey cover their eyes with the precepts;\nWhen they hear praise or blame, or the five tones,\nThey seal their ears with the precepts;\nWhen they encounter the eight delicacies or sweet, fragrant delicacies,\nThey shut their mouths with the precepts;\nWhen they crave wealth, the seven treasures, or rare jewels,\nIndulging their passions to excess,\nThey subdue their hearts with the precepts;\nWhen their minds incline toward lewdness or covetous, wicked deeds,\nThey break their feet with the precepts.\n\nThose who can practice these five\nWill cause their seven ancestors to be born in heaven,\nClothed and fed naturally,\nTheir bodies attaining immortality,\nAscending at dawn in broad daylight.\nIf they undergo liberation by means of the corpse,\nThey will transform and become perfected.\nThe worthy, with sincere devotion, uphold these precepts.\nIf men or women cannot accept and practice them,\nThere is nothing to be done—\nI would rather give someone ten thousand gold pieces\nThan write these words.\n\nDao-ling, you must choose whom to transmit this to,\nDo not leak the true scripture.\nAttachment to sensual desire and emotion\nDestroys oneself and ruins the body.\nWorldly people cannot relinquish these.\nThis concludes the urging to abandon evil;\nNext, citing the precepts to urge cultivation.\n\nFirst, describing the upholder of the precepts,\nThen, the precepts themselves.\nOnly Daoists,\nTo the point of \"never transgressing even once\";\nOnly Daoists,\nAlone able to awaken and understand,\nFirmly upholding the teachings and precepts,\nRestraining body and mind,\nEven amidst love and desire,\nNever violating them.\n\nThis concludes the description of the upholder of the precepts;\nNext, the precepts themselves:\nWhen seeing beauty, profit, glory, or dazzling splendor,\nCover the eyes with the precepts, allowing no gaze;\nWhen hearing the five tones, lewd sounds, or seductive music,\nSeal the ears with the precepts, allowing no hearing;\nWhen encountering the eight delicacies or sweet, fragrant dishes,\nShut the mouth with the precepts, allowing no tasting;\nWhen desiring money, rare treasures, or exotic goods,\nSubdue the heart with the precepts, restraining thoughts and desires;\nWhen inclined toward lewdness or covetous, wicked deeds,\nBreak the feet with the precepts, preventing them from moving.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the precepts;\nNext, the benefits of upholding them.\nHaving described the practice of these five,\nNext, the losses of transgressors:\nIf men or women cannot accept and practice them,\nTo the point of \"I would rather give someone ten thousand gold pieces than write these words.\"\nLamenting that people of the age value wealth and despise the Dao,\nThus these words are spoken.\nTogether they sink and drown—what can be done?\nThis concludes the explanation of the losses of transgressors;\nNext, exhorting transmission.\n\nDao-ling, you must choose whom to transmit this to,\nDo not leak the true scripture.\nIf a person of reverence and

hesitate or doubt,\nKeep it secret and do not transmit it.\n\nThis concludes the prose;\nBelow are the verses.\nIn the verses, four distinctions are made:\nFirst, three and a half lines on the losses of those who do not uphold the precepts;\nSecond, three and a half lines on the benefits of upholding the precepts;\nThird, three lines on abandoning the five kinds of evil;\nFourth, two and a half

unrestrained,\nDisaster and judgment appear in the omen’s form,\nForever cut off from the Way of long life,\nThe dark soul sinks into the ghostly prison.\nWhen the sentence is served and they emerge to receive form,\nTheir six senses are incomplete.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the harm from violating the precepts;\nBelow, the benefits of upholding the precepts are made clear.\n\"Those who uphold the precepts and do no evil,\nSeal the five gates of desire\"—this is the general statement.\nBelow are the particulars:\nFrom \"The eyes do not gaze on alluring appearances\" to \"the hands and feet do not act on them\":\nThe eyes do not behold beauty,\nThe ears do not seek sounds,\nThe mouth does not taste sweetness,\nThe heart does not accept wealth,\nEven the mind harbors no external thoughts,\nThe feet do not wander recklessly.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of upholding the precepts;\nBelow, the benefits are made clear.\nFrom \"When the five evils are stilled and cease\" to \"they ascend in broad daylight to the Jade Dawn\":\nWhen the five desires of the heart are stilled and cease,\nHow can judgment be falsely imposed?\nForever united with the true Dao,\nNo longer do they sink into the ghostly prison.\nMerit accumulates from the precepts,\nAnd they ascend in broad daylight to the Jade Capital.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the benefits of upholding the precepts;\nNext, the ability to abandon the five kinds of evil is expounded.\nFrom \"The eye treats beauty as an enemy\" to \"never delighting to tread its course\":\nThe eye treats beauty as an enemy,\nNever allowing itself a single glance;\nThe ear treats sound as a foe,\nNever permitting itself to hear;\nThe mouth finds flavor bitter,\nNever allowing itself to be tainted;\nThe heart treats treasure as fault,\nNever indulging in longing;\nThe mind treats wickedness as a thief,\nNever wishing to share its path;\nThe feet treat the level path as an obstacle,\nNever delighting to tread its course.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of abandoning the five kinds of evil;\nBelow, the benefits are made clear.\nFrom \"The five sufferings share one road\" to \"thus they ascend to the heavens above\":\nThe five desires arise from one mind,\nNever inclining toward perverse and deluded attachments.\nThose who can thus abandon them\nAre called the rarest of the rare.\nHaving mastered what is difficult,\nImpurities have no place to linger.\nThe body is pure, the spirit at peace,\nThe August One abides in the cinnabar field.\nConduct perfected arises from the precepts,\nThus they attain the Way of soaring emptiness.\n\nThis concludes the explanation of the benefits of upholding the precepts.\nFrom here onward is the sixth major section,\nWhich exhorts the upholding of the scripture and cultivation of practice,\nTo clarify the benefits.\nWithin this text, there are four distinctions:\nFirst, cultivation of practice to abandon evil;\nSecond, establishing resolve to uphold the scripture;\nThird, the benefits of practicing the scripture;\nFourth, a warning against careless transmission.\n\nThe preceding text has two parts:\nFirst, an exhortation to cultivate the Dao;\nNext, an exhortation to abandon evil.\nIt speaks only of preserving the Dao:\n\"In upholding the Dharma and cultivating the Dao, be diligent;\nIn cultivating the body, be steadfast;\nIn advancing, be enduring;\nIn upholding the precepts, be firm;\nIn focused thought, be unwavering;\nIn careful contemplation, never depart from the Dao.\nAbandon evil, abandon delusion,\nAbandon demonic influences, abandon deceit,\nAbandon lewdness, abandon desire,\nCast aside all wrongdoing,\nThus embracing the true to attain ascent to the heavens.\nThis is to labor first and receive reward later,\nTo transcend the mortal body and ascend as an immortal.\nLook to the future, not merely the present.\nEvil brings no immediate calamity,\nGood brings no immediate blessing.\nReflect carefully on this,\nDevote yourself earnestly to the task,\nExert your strength in upholding the scripture and Dharma.\"\n\nThis scripture is lofty and wondrous,\nEncompassing the Three Caverns,\nThe supreme, most true, and foremost mysterious chapter.\nThose who receive and uphold it\nAre unexcelled among humanity.\nWithout the mysterious name,\nNot one in ten thousand will see it.",

      "translated_text": "Those with sincere intent should approach this as one parched and starving seeks food and drink, as one freezing seeks winter garments, or one sweltering seeks spring raiment; as the destitute finding treasure, or the lowly attaining rank. As one toiling desperately seeks rest, weary and longing for sleep; as one yearning, desiring fulfillment. Upon obtaining this scripture and Dharma, cultivate this resolve: endure hardship in accordance with the Dao, and boundless blessings shall follow.\n\nThis scripture has delivered countless souls. Those who cultivate the Dao and recite it shall attain the rank of Perfected; those in fear and reciting it shall be untouched by demons; the ill reciting it shall rise from their deathbeds; the distressed reciting it shall find natural joy; officials reciting it shall see their prison gates stay closed. If recited for the deceased, they shall rest in peace; the impoverished reciting it shall secure wealth; those facing mortal peril reciting it shall all have their lives extended; the ignorant reciting it shall gain wisdom and sagacity.\n\nOne who recites it bestows blessings upon nine generations of kin, delivers limitless beings, and nourishes the Ten Heavens. Without distinction of high or low, great or small, boundless and infinite, all receive the grace of compassion. You must guard this secret—take care not to recklessly disseminate it. To carelessly reveal the scripture or transmit it to the unworthy invites the judgment of wind-knives and consignment to the courts of ghosts. You would do well to heed this; my words are not empty.\n\nDao Ling bowed in reverence, expressed gratitude, and departed.\n\nThose who wish to uphold the scriptural precepts, study the Dao, and cultivate the body must fortify their resolve with sincerity, focus their thoughts with clarity, and keep the Dao in their hearts whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. This admonition to maintain mindfulness is followed by the exhortation to abandon evil and delusion, demonic influences and deceit, to the point of not being swayed by immediate pleasures. One must cast aside the six kinds of wrongdoing and embrace the true nature. Though the labor comes first, ascension to immortality follows. One should anticipate future rewards rather than seek present gratification.\n\nThis exhortation to forsake evil is followed by the encouragement to uphold the scriptures. It is divided into three parts: first, a direct exhortation; second, an illustrative exhortation; and third, a synthesis of the analogy. The preceding text is further divided: first, the encouragement to uphold the scriptures, then the praise of the scripture’s exalted virtue.\n\nHere begins the first part. Though evil brings no immediate calamity and good no immediate blessing, the transformation wrought by blessings and virtue is inevitable. One should therefore devote oneself earnestly to receiving the scriptural Dharma. This concludes the encouragement to receive the scriptures, followed by praise of the Dharma.\n\nThis scripture is lofty and wondrous, encompassing the Three Caverns, supreme and most true, the foremost of the mysterious. As the scripture is exalted, so too are those who receive it. Without the mysterious name and the bone of an immortal, one will never encounter this scripture. This concludes the praise of the Dharma. Below, an analogy is drawn: those with sincere intent should be like one parched and starving seeking food and drink, to the point of yearning for fulfillment. This concludes the analogy, followed by the synthesis: upon seeing this scripture and Dharma, one should cultivate this resolve, enduring hardship in accordance with the Dao, and boundless blessings shall follow.\n\nThe eight contemplations above, if pursued with diligence and in accordance with the Dao, will bring limitless blessings. This concludes the encouragement to uphold and recite the scriptures, followed by the enumeration of its benefits.\n\nThis scripture has delivered countless beings, and its ten blessings are as follows: those who cultivate the Dao and recite it attain the rank of Perfected; those in fear reciting it are untouched by demons; the ill reciting it rise from their deathbeds; the distressed reciting it find natural joy; officials reciting it see their prison gates stay closed; if recited for the deceased, they rest in peace; the impoverished reciting it secure wealth; those facing mortal peril reciting it have their lives extended; the ignorant reciting it gain wisdom and sagacity; and one who recites it bestows blessings upon nine generations of kin. This concludes the ten blessings of the scripture, followed by the expounding of its vast and far-reaching merits.\n\nIt delivers limitless beings, its grace flows through the Ten Heavens, without distinction of high or low, boundless and infinite, all bathed in its compassion. The blessings of this scripture are beyond comprehension, nourishing the Ten Heavens and flowing through all realms. This concludes the praise of the scripture’s benefits, followed by the warning against careless transmission.\n\nYou must guard this secret—take care not to recklessly disseminate it. To carelessly reveal the scripture or transmit it to the unworthy invites the judgment of wind-knives and consignment to the courts of ghosts. You would do well to heed this; my words are not empty. This concludes the warning, followed by the Heavenly Master’s reception of the teaching. Dao Ling bowed in reverence, expressed gratitude, and departed.\n\nHere concludes the scroll on the \"Harmonious Practice\" of the *Supreme Pervading Mystery Inner Teachings of the Numinous Treasure*. Next, the assembly shall convene at Penglai, where the revelation of the great and manifest truth shall be expounded.",
