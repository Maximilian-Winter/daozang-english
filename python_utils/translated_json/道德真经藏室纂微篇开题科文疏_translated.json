  "full_translation": "**Translation:**\n\n---\n\n**Title:** *Exegesis of the *Dao De Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Virtue) – The Hidden Chamber, Refined and Expanded, with Preface and Verse Commentaries*\n\n**Full Title:** *Exegesis of the *Dao De Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Virtue) – The Hidden Chamber, Refined and Expanded, with Preface and Verse Commentaries.*\nBy **Xue Zhi Xuan** of the Yuan Dynasty. Five volumes.\nThis work elucidates **Chen Jingyuan’s** *Dao De Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Virtue) – *Hidden Chamber, Refined and Expanded* (*Muwu Pian*) and its preface, *Refined and Expanded Preface* (*Kaiti*).\n\n**Foreword to the Exegesis of the *Dao De Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Virtue) – The Hidden Chamber, Refined and Expanded, with Preface and Verse Commentaries:**\n\nThe **Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue** of **Laozi** have circulated in the world for **1,500 years**. Shining like the sun and moon across the heavens, it requires no praise. Commentaries—both ancient and modern—number over a hundred schools, yet despite their varying depths and breadths, all have contributed in their own way to **illuminating the sacred teachings** of the **Daoist Sage**.\n\nI have observed **Chen Jingyuan’s** (Master Bixu) exegesis, which **weaves together the interpretations of a hundred scholars**, dissects the profound subtleties, and cites evidence with meticulous clarity. His work is **comprehensive from beginning to end**, especially prized in recent times. Yet, **beginners** who open its pages often feel **bewildered**, sighing like those who gaze upon the distant sea.\n\n**Master Taixia Zhenren** possesses **pure virtue and refined essence**, his studies are vast and profound, and he is hailed as the **master of the feathered stream** (orthodox Daoist lineage). For **fifty years**, he has expounded the **Dao De Jing** with **deep insight**, truly ascending to the hall of mysteries. In the midst of his **refined cultivation and contemplation**, he composed **seven volumes of verse exegesis**, **two volumes of *Refined and Expanded Preface*** (*Zuanwei Kaiti*), and **two volumes of *Total Chapter Praise*** (*Zongzhang Jiasong*), meticulously **unraveling and elucidating** tens of thousands of words. His intention was to guide scholars **from the currents to the source**, seeking profundity through breadth, like climbing a ladder to reach the **ninth tier of the celestial platform**. The higher one ascends, the wider the view; thus, upon attaining the **ultimate realm of the Mysterious Dao** (*Chongxian*), comprehending the **great name of the Dao** (*Daodao qiangming*), transcending **form and substance**, and **dismissing both existence and non-existence**, one **naturally finds fulfillment beyond the mundane**, and then—**with reverence**—offers a **single pinch of incense** to **Laozi**, hoping not to betray the **earnest efforts of a lifetime**.\n\nThough the work has long been completed, it was **kept hidden** and not published. **Master Zhang Dasheng** of **Fengxiang** and **Master Bai Xianshang** of **Meiyuan** repeatedly **urged its dissemination**, desiring to **engrave it on woodblocks** for wider circulation. **Master Liu Boying** of **Jingzhao** praised it and brought it to fruition, **entrusting me** to write this foreword. Their **noble intentions** are worthy of admiration, hence my willingness to comply.\n\n**Li Ting’s Foreword from the *Dao De Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Virtue) – The Hidden Chamber:**\nThe **unity of the Dao** permeates **all things under heaven**. It is **manifest in the Sage’s wisdom** and **expressed in the Sage’s words**.\n\nTo **observe the Sage’s words** without **investigating their origin**, one may be **confused by the myriad phenomena**—**endless, varied, and tangled**—yet unable to **grasp their totality** or **encompass their essence**. The **Dao arises from unity**, disperses into multiplicity; those who **fail to recognize that multiplicity returns to unity** have **not pursued the study of roots and origins**.\n\nThe **source of *Laozi’s* *Dao De Jing*** is **one**. Though it is called the **Upper Classic** (*Shangjing*) and the **Lower Classic** (*Xiajing*), they are **not two**; though it consists of **eighty-one chapters** and **five thousand words**, they are **not two**. Rather, **the unity of the Dao** is **embodied within** the **Upper and Lower Classics**, the **eighty-one chapters**, and the **five thousand words**, so that **all future generations** may **know the one through the one**.\n\nThe **principle of unity** is **vast and boundless**, **difficult to describe or define**. To call it **\"having\"**, it **cannot be spoken of**; to call it **\"not having\"**, it **does not depart from things**. Before **heaven and earth took form** and **all things emerged**, this was **the unity**; yet it **already existed within them**. After **heaven and earth established their positions** and **all things were classified**, this was **the unity**; yet it **was nowhere that it was not present**.\n\n**Heaven and earth**, attaining **the unity**, became **heaven and earth**; **all things**, attaining **the unity**, became **all things**; and the **Sage**, attaining **the unity of heaven and earth and all things**, **enlightened the world**. Later generations **cannot fully grasp it through a single word or theory**. Thus, *Laozi’s* **Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue** were composed.\n\n**Master Bixu** (Chen Jingyuan) **emerged a thousand years later**, **devoted to guarding the unity** with an **empty mind**, and **inherited the profound Daoist tradition**. He **refined and expanded** the preface, and his words **reached the utmost truth**. Yet **Master Taixia Zhenren** believed that **Master Bixu’s** scholarship was **vast and profound**, his **citations broad and deep**, beyond the grasp of **ordinary students of orthodoxy**. Moreover, **after the upheavals of later times**, **scriptures were burned**, leaving **no reference for study**; he feared that **the tradition would fade with time**.\n\nThus, **Master Taixia Zhenren** **rooted his work in Master Bixu’s**, **cross-referenced his lifelong studies**, and **further expounded and elucidated**, composing **this verse exegesis** and **appending the *Total Chapter Praise***, totaling **tens of thousands of words**. He **dissected and organized** them, **interwove and connected** them, **explored every angle**, and **exhaustively detailed** all aspects, thereby completing this **magnum opus**. His **concerns were profound**, so his **words were precise**; his **worries were deep**, so his **explanations were thorough**. **Master Bixu’s** original work **lacked no subtlety**.\n\nAh, this **Classic**—**Laozi** wrote it, **Master Bixu** refined it, and **Master Taixia Zhenren** further **expounded** it. Why has it **endured through countless ages** while **so many interpretations** have been made? It is because **the principle of unity** is **difficult to describe or define**.\n\nYet, **future scholars** must **not fear its height** and **shrink from its difficulty**, nor **dismiss it as equal** and **treat it lightly**. They must **cultivate keen insight and clear discernment**, **progress daily and monthly**, **diligently and tirelessly** **without pause**, **deeply pondering** and **truly embodying** it, then **this unity** will **resonate within their hearts**, and **they will awaken to it without expecting to**.\n\nThus, **one may see** that **those who rise from the ordinary to the sacred**, **transcend the mundane**, **wander freely in the eight extremes**, and **dwell in the celestial gardens** (*Lingyuan*) may **well begin here**. Though its **remaining threads** are **coarse and unrefined**, they are **still sufficient** to **harmonize the family**, **govern the state**, and **pacify the world**.\n\n**Master Bai Xianshang** of **Meiyuan**, **Master Liu Boying** of **Chang’an**, and **Master Zhang Dasheng** of **Fengxiang** **engraved this work on woodblocks** for dissemination, and **Master Jie Shou** of **Pucheng** (Master Jue Gong) **lectured on it publicly**. They **entrusted me** with the **foreword**, and so I **write this brief introduction** to fulfill their request.\n\nThe Great Mongol Empire, in the autumn of the year *jǐyǒu* (1299), on the seventh month’s last day, the Imperial Commissioner for the Shaanxi Waterworks, Vice-Marshal Guo Shizhong of Taihua, requested a preface.\n\nMaster Kang Jie said: *\"The Primordial Diagram is the Dao of the Heart. The Heart—ah, the Heart!—is the grand repository of all principles between Heaven and Earth. The sixty-four hexagrams of the Great Ease, their pure, subtle, and profound meanings, all originate from the Heart’s designs. The teachings of the Two Sovereigns and Three Kings, their unity and adherence to the Mean, all stem from the Heart’s law. The disciples of the Mo and Si schools, their unity in loyalty and reciprocity, all derive from the study of the Heart. The profound and mysterious realm of the Spirit Palace—ancient sages delved deeply into its subtleties, probing its mysteries and hidden meanings, thereby transcending the mundane to attain sainthood, awakening to the Dao and verifying the True. Those who seek to fathom the secrets of the Primordial Diagram or penetrate the depths of the *Daode Jing* must, above all, enter through the One Heart.*\n\n*Across countless ages, the transmission of the Heart to the Heart, of the Sage to the Sage, has revealed Laozi’s unspeakable teachings and uncovered the hidden mechanisms of the Primordial. Only the True Person of Great Xia was capable of attaining this.*\n\n*When he refined his eloquence in the gardens of letters and led the Confucian scholars, his prestige was unmatched. Later, as he explored the Dao’s threshold and delved into its mysteries, his teachings became the standard by which the sect was measured. Favored by two dynasties, his fame endured through the ages. Once dwelling in the sacred Hua Mountains, he gathered disciples and friends, gazing down upon the world’s dust, truly embodying the authentic and the practiced for many years. In the winter of *dīngwèi* (1307), Marshal Wang Pingdong, the Conqueror of Cold, extended an invitation with great ceremony. The True Person, though far, graciously accepted, arriving on a crane’s reins and a crane’s steed, making Kangtong his permanent abode—truly the rebirth of Guangchengzi.*\n\n*The mountains and rivers took on a new splendor, the grasses and trees grew brighter, and the air was filled with harmonious qi, while the teachings resonated like a swelling tide. Those who heard the echoes and glimpsed the radiance were not merely the tens of states of Shaanxi. For when even an inch of land is illuminated, the boundless sky is unobstructed; when the Spirit Platform is clarified, still waters mirror the heavens. Like the moon after rain, the breeze after calm, a chest of wine poured freely, the ice wheel and jade mirror—his mind was open and luminous. With the learning of self-attainment through the One Heart, he expounded the effortless essence of the Two Classics, elucidating their themes and citing their texts. The profound meanings became clear, the doctrines were meticulously explained, ancient and modern verified, doubts dispelled—each word a gateway to the mysterious, each character a manifestation of eternal truth. The open are easily enlightened, the enlightened easily attain. Laozi’s original intent shone like the sun, and within the mysterious, there was awakening, beyond doubt. Those who read it were invigorated in body and mind, merging with the text—entitled *Exegesis of the True Dao Classic*.*\n\n*Young scholars, like those emerging from clouds to see the blue sky, ascending Kunlun to find a piece of jade, are fortunate indeed to benefit from this. Is this not magnificent?*\n\n*One day, Marshal Wang gathered the scholars in court and instructed his attendant: ‘The True Person’s *Exegesis of the True Dao Classic* shares the same Heart-law as Laozi himself—truly something unseen by later learners. Among the Dao companions, Master Zhang of Xiqian has already had it engraved on woodblocks. Yet fearing its transmission was not yet widespread, he wished to have it inscribed with lacquered court seals and stored on fine paper, printed and disseminated broadly to expand its reach, serving as the key to unlock the gates for scholars. This is indeed a great kindness.’*\n\n*The attendant replied: ‘The pearl of the Jin and the jade of Zhao—why seek a merchant?’ I, unworthy as I am, how could I comprehend the Sage’s intent? I declined, but my refusal was not accepted.*\n\nThe presumptuous praise I dare to append is like imitating Heaven and Earth or painting the sun and moon—one only reveals their ignorance of measure.\n\nTo obtain the fish and forget the basket, to obtain the hare and forget the snares, to obtain the elephant and forget the words—this belongs to those later Dao cultivators who attain it themselves.\n\nAt the time of the *ji-you* year without a *wu-she* day (645 CE), I, the Old Man of Great Dawn, resided in Pingzhou, where the scholar-official Feng Fuxu recounted the *Collected Micro-Commentaries on the Hidden Meanings of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic*, Volume One of the *Exposition of the Opening Themes*.\n\nThe True Person of Azure Void said:\n\nThe two Classics of *Dao/Way* and *Virtue* by Laozi encompass a comprehensive discourse on emptiness, void, and nothingness; natural virtue and power; divine harmony and great unity; Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang; the sages, feudal lords, and commoners of all ranks; and the movements of plants and animals. They are vast yet contain nothing they do not embrace, subtle yet encompass nothing they do not permeate.\n\nThus, Sima Qian praised them, saying: *\"The Nine Classics are vast, yet none surpass the brevity of these two chapters.\"*\n\nNow, as I expound upon this Classic, I first clarify the sovereign intent behind its transmission, then reveal the author of this commentary. This Classic is spoken by the Most High Lord Laozi, the *Collected Micro-Commentaries* are composed by the True Person of Azure Void, Chen Jingyuan, and the *Opening Themes* are his own account. Though unworthy, I, the Old Man of Great Dawn, dare to expound upon the thematic outlines and elucidate the *Opening Themes*, hoping scholars may discern the origin and purpose of the Primordial One’s transmission, understand the True Person’s exposition of the Primordial Way, and enter through these thematic outlines.\n\nTo measure the sea with a ladle, to gaze at Heaven through a tube—this is truly the ignorance of measure.\n\nNow, I shall open the themes, dividing them into twenty categories, listed as follows:\n\n1. Clarifying the True Person of Azure Void’s original intent in compiling the *Collected Micro-Commentaries* and *Opening Themes*.\n2. Correctly interpreting the *Opening Themes*, first elucidating the Most High’s surname, given name, and honorific titles, then explaining whether he is the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Heavens or the Teacher of a Hundred Kings, revealing his hidden and manifest traces.\n3. Clarifying the era, month, day, and hour of the Most High’s conception, gestation, and birth.\n4. Clarifying the Most High’s divine appearance after birth, his seventy-two auspicious marks, eighty-one virtues, and the region where he resided.\n5. Clarifying how the Most High, though a hidden sage, lived as an ordinary mortal, serving in lowly ranks to assist the rulers of his time, and his departure from the Zhou dynasty.\n6. Clarifying the biography of the True Person of the Pass and his divination of stars and qi, recognizing the omen of a sage crossing the Pass.\n7. Clarifying the year and month of the Most High’s crossing of the Pass, and his subsequent meeting with the True Person Yin in the market of Qingyang, Shu.\n8. Clarifying how, during the reign of King You of Zhou, the Most High returned to Central China. *The Broad Exegesis of the Sacred* states that he returned during the reign of King Ping, allowing Confucius to inquire about rites and lament that he was like a hidden dragon.\n9. Clarifying how, knowing the Zhou Way was declining, the Most High crossed the Pass again, changed his name and titles, concealed his extraordinary abilities, and lived as a commoner, with his lifespan unknown to all.\n10. Clarifying how the Most High, embracing the Dao and virtue, lived as a hidden sage among mortals, with his lineage enduring through generations, his descendants never ceasing their sacrifices.\n11. Clarifying how the Most High is the spirit of one who attains the Dao, receiving the title Laozi.\n12. Clarifying how the Most High possesses divine powers, acting as the sovereign of the Dao, transmitting teachings to the world through myriad methods to save humanity.\n13. Clarifying how the Most High, through serene inaction and non-doing, preserved this within, and through harmonizing with the mundane, responded externally, thus earning the title *True Person of Great Assistance*.\n14. Clarifying how Laozi and Zhuangzi also had wives and descendants, yet as masters of the Great Dao, they wished later generations to know that the Way of longevity could be attained through diligent cultivation, not through supernatural means alone.\n15. Clarifying how the Most High’s profound benevolence pervades all, his sacred virtue enduring far and wide, with each dynasty venerating him, his temples and statues never vanishing, hence the Tang’s honorific title of *Holy Ancestor*.\n16. Clarifying why later recipients of these two chapters titled them *Classic*.\n17. Correctly elucidating the meaning of *Dao/Way and Virtue*.\n18. Correctly interpreting the Classic’s teachings and the intent behind the eighty-one chapters of the two Classics.\n19. Clarifying the fundamental principles of the two Classics of *Dao/Way and Virtue*, their essence for governing the state and cultivating the self.\n20. Clarifying why the True Person of Azure Void compiled and expounded upon these commentaries, unfolding the meaning of *Dao/Way and Virtue* for the benefit of later scholars.\n\nThe commentary states: This first category clarifies the True Person of Azure Void’s original intent in compiling the *Collected Micro-Commentaries* and *Opening Themes*.\n\nNow, as I expound upon this Classic, I first elucidate the *Opening Themes*. Having interpreted the *Opening Themes*, I must then clarify the author who first composed them.\n\nThese *Collected Micro-Commentaries* and *Opening Themes* are the work of the True Person of Azure Void, Chen Jingyuan, with the given name Jingyuan, courtesy name Taichu, and mystical appellation Azure Void Child. His family hailed from Jianchang.\n\nHis great-grandfather, Zhixun, and grandfather, Lingxin, both gained renown for filial piety in serving their parents, both refusing high office.\n\nThe True Person’s father, the late Prefect, was elevated to the rank of *jinshi* (advanced scholar), and his surname was **Xu** (解胊, *jiě tuó*), with the given name **Yu** (玉, *yù*).\n\nThe late Prefect served as a County Magistrate in **Shan County** (山令), residing in **Gaoyou** (高邮), where he passed away due to illness. His mother, the late Lady, lived in poverty without means to return home.\n\nThey had four sons, with the True Person being the youngest. When his elder brothers died in succession after the **Chuxiao** (除祥) event, he alone remained with a resolve to pursue the **Way of the Outer World** (方外志).\n\nIn the year **Regong 2** (庆历二年), he took **Master Han Zhizhi** (韩知止), the **Ritual Master of Tianqing Observatory** (天庆观礼崇道大师) in Gaoyou, as his teacher. In the third year, he passed the **examination of Daoist scriptures** (经度) and became a **Daoist** (道士). At eighteen, he set out on his travels, visiting famous mountains, and reached **Tiantai** (天台), where he studied the *Sutras of the Three Caverns* (三洞经). There, he encountered the **High Daoist Zhang Wumeng** (张无梦), and from him, he gained the subtle **Dao/Way of the ancient Laozi and Zhuangzi** (老庄微旨).\n\nLater, he secluded himself in the **Jiang-Huai region** (江淮间), finding amusement in **Daoist music and texts** (琴书).\n\nAfter some time, he wished to visit the **capital** (京辇), and **Yang Shijun** (杨使君), the **Secretary of the Ministry of Rites** (礼部侍郎) **Wang Qi** (王琪), recommended him in verse to **Wang Xigong** (王岐公):\n\n*\"The old words of the Ao Mountain are long,\nAnd I delight to see the square pupil again.\"*\n\nAt that time, **Xigong** served as **Hanhua Academy’s Chief Editor** (翰林承旨), and he was pleased by his arrival. Thus, he was enrolled in the **Ruiyun Daoist Monastery** (瑞云), and repeatedly requested him to lecture on the *Two Daoist Classics* (道德二篇) and the *Southern Flower Sutra* (南华). His lectures never ceased.\n\nAt that time, **high-ranking officials and scholars** (公卿大夫) all sought to recognize him.\n\nThen, the **Liquan Daoist Monastery** (醴泉观) promoted him to **Chief Compiler** (提总奏) and assigned him to the **original observatory** (本观) as its **Editor** (修撰). When he visited **That King’s Temple** (那王谒真君祠), he was summoned to discuss **Daoist matters** (道家事), and his **comprehensive response** (该通) earned him the **Purple Robe** (紫衣).\n\nEmperor **Shenzong** (神宗) established the **Grand Universal Daoist Ritual** (普天大醮), and he was ordered to draft the **Sacred Daoist Texts** (劲令修撰青词). His work was well-received, and he was further instructed to participate in the **construction of the Jianchang Pavilion** (建章阁) alongside **Tianjie** (天节) in the **ritual offerings** (修奉). Following this, he was granted an audience and bestowed with the **appellation of True and Tranquil** (真靖之号).\n\nIn the fifth year of **Xining** (熙宁五年), he submitted his annotated *Dao/Way and Virtue Classic* (所注《道德经》). The imperial decree praised it:\n\n*\"The Classic submitted by Chen Jingyuan dissects the profound, analyzes the subtle, synthesizes the teachings of a hundred schools, and its meaning is detailed and complete—truly worthy of adoption. Among his peers, he should be commended and rewarded. Thus, he is specially appointed as the **Right Street Chief Supervisor** (右街都监), overseeing the **signing and dispatching of Daoist teachings** (签书教门公事). His honor in the Daoist ranks was rare at that time.\"*\n\nThe Emperor summoned him back to Gaoyou to attend to his parents’ burial. At that time, the court dispatched an imperial envoy bearing a gift of thirty *jin* of white gold, and further proclaimed:\n\n*\"Now that the Taiyi Palace has been completed within the capital, let Chen Jingyuan oversee it.\"*\n\nUpon his return to the court, he was ordered to select and ordain disciples of strict discipline and purity—no more than twenty in number—to assist in the rituals. On the twelfth day of the eleventh month of the sixth year of **Xining** (熙宁六年), he was summoned to the **Yanhe Hall** (延和殿) for an audience, where each was granted official ranks and responsibilities.\n\nOn the fifteenth day, the **Taiyi Palace** was consecrated. On the following day, the imperial procession visited the palace, where the customary rites were completed. In the **Yanqi Hall** (延棋殿), he was granted a special promotion to **External Right Street Vice Daoist Master of Records** (额外右街副道录), and three of his disciples were ordained. Additionally, the palace was permitted to ordain one disciple annually, with monthly provisions of sixty *hu* of rice for offerings, twenty thousand strings of cash, and grants of land in the southern and northern estates to support the community.\n\nAfter some time, due to the burden of his duties, he requested leave and retired to his secluded hermitage at **Fufu**. The local officials reported this to the court, but the request was denied.\n\nA further imperial decree was issued, entrusting him with his original official duties and ordering the palace clerks not to interfere. Each year, the number of ordination certificates was increased by two. Later, due to discrepancies in the **Nine Ranks of Ritual Offerings** (九等斋科), and the lack of proper hierarchy in the imperial Daoist titles, the court established an office and selected three Daoist masters to examine and rectify these matters, so that the **Zhenren** (真人) could oversee their assessment.\n\nThe Right Censor-in-Chief **Li Suzhi** (李肃之), the **Gunmi Direct Scholar** **Sun Yong** (孙永), and the **Promoted Discussant** **Yang Jie** (杨杰) were appointed to oversee the editing and polishing of the texts. Upon completion, they were presented to the throne, and he was granted silk banners, ordination certificates, and the title of **Purple-Clad Master** (紫衣师号), along with permission to promulgate the revised texts.\n\nAt that time, the court sought to bestow the titles of **Nine-Heaven Exploring Envoy** (九天探访使) and **Five-Peak Venerable Master** (五岳丈人). The Grand Chancellor petitioned that the **Zhenren** be granted official robes, insignia, and titles. Thus, the **Zhenren** drafted the formal protocols, and the titles were conferred: **Yingyuan Baoyun Zhenjun** (应元保运真君) for the Nine-Heaven Exploring Envoy and **Chufu Dingming Zhenjun** (储福定命真君) for the Five-Peak Venerable Master. Among his hidden works was the *Xuanri Zhongyu* (轩日种玉).\n\nFrom the Grand Chancellor **Wu Kui** (吴奎), the Left Chancellor **Pu Zongmeng** (蒲宗孟), and the **Hanlin Scholar** **Wang Qi Gong** (王岐公) down to the eminent artisans, scholars, and virtuous officials of the time, many composed poems in mutual exchange and presented them to him. Due to their abundance, they are not fully recorded here but are included in his separate biography.\n\nIn the capital, there were twelve Daoist officials, who, in the reigns of the ancestors, oversaw the official observatories within and without the imperial city, presiding over the rituals of incense-offerings and sacrifices. Those who demonstrated diligence were appointed to public office upon imperial decree. Whenever there were vacancies, they petitioned to be tested on the *Daode Jing*, the *Nanhua Jing* (《南华经》), and the *Lingbao Duren Jing* (《灵宝度人经》), along with the ten doctrines of Daoist practice.\n\nThe Emperor approved their request and ordered the Bureau of Compilations to oversee the examinations. Thereafter, Daoist learning underwent a profound transformation, marking a new beginning from that point.\n\nIn the sixth year of Yuanfong (元丰六年), the affairs of these Daoist observatories were abolished, and he retired into seclusion at Mount Mao (茅山), where he collated and corrected the scriptures of the Three Caverns (三洞经法). Seekers of the Dao from all quarters flocked to him, their numbers swelling.\n\nAfter some time, he donned the simple attire of a scholar-official, carrying a satchel, and traveled to Mount Song and Mount Tai to seek out places for alchemical refining. In the third year of Yuanyou (元佑三年), while passing through the capital, he was invited by the officials of the Middle Taiyi Palace (中太乙宫) and below to oversee its establishment. The Daoist Master had played a pivotal role in its founding, so they urged him to stay, offering him the reverent offerings of *zhīmù* (芝木). Shortly afterward, the court reinstated him to his former position as Right Street Daoist Registrar (右街道录).\n\nThe Right Vice Chancellor, Su Shi (苏轼), said to him: *\"The Venerable Master should transmit his teachings to his disciples; otherwise, the art of refining may not endure for future generations.\"* Among his vast collection of over a thousand volumes—both inner and outer texts—were all those he had personally annotated. He also meticulously copied out three hundred scrolls, mastering the fine cursive script, and his calligraphy closely followed the styles of Ouyang Xun (欧阳询) and Chu Suiliang (褚遂良). His written works included:\n- *Cangshi Zuanwei* (《藏室纂微》), two volumes;\n- *Nanhua Jing Zhangju* (《南华经章句》), seven volumes;\n- *Zongzhang* (《总章》), three volumes;\n- *Chaoyi* (《抄义》), three volumes;\n- *Baozhu Miaoyi* (《宝珠妙义》), three volumes;\n- *Fujie* (《肤解》), one volume;\n- *Yizhen Jianhou Yi* (《翼真检后义》), one volume;\n- *Xugao Shi Zuan* (《续高士篡改为《退身传集》》);\n- Three commentaries on the *Tongxuan Jing* (《通玄经》);\n- Four commentaries on the *Duren Jing* (《度人经》);\n- Exegeses and annotations on the *Xisheng Jing* (《西升经》).\n\nIn his later years, he devoted himself entirely to alchemical practice, purchasing cinnabar from Gengling (绛陵), refining it in his sacred chamber, and distilling the elixir, striving for the ultimate attainment of the Nine Returns and Seven Rebirths. His lifespan neared its limit, yet he remained vigorous. He often consumed mica powder and claimed that in his youth, he had ingested cinnabar, retaining the vigor of youth despite his silvered hair—his complexion and flesh remained as youthful as ever.\n\nIn the fifth month of the first year of Shaosheng (绍圣元年), without any prior illness, he suddenly lost his appetite, drinking only water thereafter. By the thirteenth day of the sixth month, at noon, he requested a bath and new robes, then summoned his disciples to gather before him. He said: *\"Write my death notice: ‘Departed to the Primordial Child’s Palace of the Three Pure Ones.’\"*\n\nAfter they had written it, he had them placed outside the hall of abstinence and ordered his body to be cremated. He then arranged his sitting cushions facing the northwest and, after refining his body and gazing toward the Celestial Gate, softly tapped his teeth, then sat again. He instructed his attendants to prepare a stack of bamboo slips and wrote a farewell inscription to show the disciples, declaring:\n\n*\"Once I was in harmony with the Dao,\nNow I shed this mortal form.\nNeither transformation nor birth—\nI return to my true abode.\"*\n\nAs he finished speaking, his vital essence ascended with a prolonged sigh, and he departed in tranquility. His body was temporarily placed at the Yangsheng Yuan (养生院) outside the Xuanhua Gate (宣化门).\n\nFrom the moment of his physical departure until the time of his spiritual ascension, the height of summer had arrived, yet his form remained serene and lifelike. All who gazed upon him—regardless of age or station—unanimously marveled and sighed in reverence.\n\nThe sage enjoyed the blessings of spring and autumn for seven decades,\nAnd as he reached mid-autumn, his life’s light extinguished—\nHis mortal form was laid to rest in the burial ground granted by his ancestral temple.\n\nAt the moment the grave was sealed,\nSuddenly three *jiaxié* butterflies fluttered and danced before it,\nAnd after a time, the grave was leveled—\nThey then drifted away toward the southeast.\n\nThe *Jixian* Palace scholar and compiler Wang [□] inscribed an epitaph, saying:\n*\"Ah! There was the sitting-forgetfulness of Sima Xi of the Tang,\nThe eloquent writings of Wu Zhengjie,\nAnd the teachings of Du Guangting.\nThough these three masters excelled in different eras,\nOur sage encompassed all their virtues.\nThus, his disciples praised him so.\"*\n\nThough he mingled with court officials and scholars of the realm,\nHe never bowed in deference to any—\nYet in his studies, he was never weary, even in old age.\nThus, he delved into the *Lánghán* treasures and *Bǎojí* classics,\nThe *Jīnjiān* and *Yùshū* of refined insight,\nSeeking the profound mysteries of the Dao.\n\nWhen it came to expounding teachings in gatherings or private discourse,\nHis brilliance and persuasive argumentation were unmatched.\nThose who questioned the *Lǎozǐ* or *Zhuāngzǐ* of old times\nFound their doubts clarified by his elucidation of the essential truths.\n\nIn all his poetic works and miscellaneous writings,\nHe mastered the styles of *Táo Yī* and *Gě Yǐ*,\nSo his phrases were bold yet refined, vigorous yet elegant—\nMinisters and officials alike sighed in admiration.\n\nHis *Qíjiè* departed, ascending to the void and entering stillness,\nBeyond mortal measure.\nYet they imagined his divine form,\nAnd together sought to preserve his teachings of virtue.\n\nFor the conduct of a true person,\nIts beginning and end were briefly mentioned before.\nThe meaning of *kāití* is now clarified in the following passage—\nThe text will dissolve its enigma.\n\nFor *kāi* is to unfold,\nAnd *tí* is to mark a title.\nIt means to unfold this *Sūtra*’s principles\nAnd mark its themes,\nSo as to reveal them to future generations.\nThus it is said *kāití*,\nOr also *kāishì* this *Sūtra*’s title.\n\nBefore expounding the text,\nOne must first interpret its title.\n\nThis *Sūtra*’s title is called:\n*The Tàishàng Dàodé Jīng Cángshì Zuǎnwēi Kāití*.\n*\"Tàishàng\"* is the honorific name of *Lǎojūn*.\n*\"Dàodé\"* is the foundation of the Five *Cáng* Virtues,\nAnd the source of all *Fǎ*.\n*\"Jīng\"* means eternal principle,\n*\"Fǎ\"* means eternal law.\nIt states that this *Dàodé* is the unchanging law for all ages.\n*\"Cáng\"* is pronounced with level tone—\nAlso...\"\n\n*The Chamber of Secrets*\n\n*\"Shì\"* means **the innermost sanctum**.\nIt refers to the **hidden chamber of the *Xuāndū* treasure trove**—\nthe **perfectly concealed scriptures**.\n\n*\"Zuǎn\"* means **to gather and compile**.\n*\"Wēi\"* means **profound subtlety**.\nIt refers to **delving into the arcane texts of the hidden chamber**,\n**compiling the subtle intentions of past sages**,\nso as to **verify and elucidate the *Dàodé***.\nThus it is said:\n*The Tàishàng Dàodé Jīng Cángshì Zuǎnwēi Kāití*.\n\nThis is its **general outline**.\n\nAs for the **detailed interpretations following the text**,\nthey are already **exhaustively explained in the *Kāití* section by section**.\nNow, this *kēwén shū* is merely **the *Tàixiá Lǎorén*’s misguided exposition of the *Kāití*, leading to confusion**.\n\n*\"Shū\"* (平音) means **to clarify**.\n*\"Jué\"* means **to resolve**.\nIt is like **stagnant water blocked and unflowing**—\n**clearing its channels in sequence** so that it **pours into the rivers and seas**.\n\nNow, I shall **divide the *Kāití*’s main framework into twelve categories**,\nand **clarify them in sequence**,\nso that all scholars may **follow this exposition and attain understanding of the *Dàodé***.\nThus it is called *kēwén shū*.\n\n---\n**End of Volume One of the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng Cángshì Mùwēi Kāití Kēwén Shū***\n**Volume Two of the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng Cángshì Zuǎnwēi Kāití Kēwén Shū***\n**Exposition by the *Tàixiá Lǎorén* Xué Zhìxuān**\n**Opening the Title**\n\nThe **Title** states: *\"All titles called 'Kāití' are indeed the opening exposition of the *Bìxū*.\"*\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ* bears the surname **Li**, given name **Ēr**, with the courtesy name **Pìn**, or alternatively **Bóyáng**. According to the Daoist scriptures, he **emerged before the void’s formation**, mastering the subtleties of natural transformation, and **dwelled perpetually in the heavens**, serving as the sovereign teacher of the emperors. This pertains to matters beyond the six directions, thus omitted here. Only the broad outline is presented, excluding divergent accounts.\n\nThe **Exposition** states: This is the **second category**, properly elucidating the *Kāití*, first clarifying the *Tàishàng*’s surname, given name, courtesy name, and posthumous title, then revealing his dual roles—as sovereign of the ten thousand heavens and teacher of the hundred kings—manifesting in hidden and revealed forms. Within this category, it is further divided into two sections:\n\nThe **first section** clarifies the *Tàishàng*’s surname, given name, courtesy name, and posthumous title.\nThe **second section** clarifies how the *Tàishàng* serves as sovereign of the ten thousand heavens and teacher of the hundred kings, embodying hidden and revealed traces.\n\nAs for the **first section on the surname, given name, courtesy name, and posthumous title**, the *Title* states: *\"The Lǎozǐ bears the surname Li, given name Ēr, courtesy name Pìn, or alternatively Bóyáng. Some say his posthumous title is Zhí.\"* The name *Lǎozǐ* is the *Tàishàng*’s inner designation, already detailed in the **eleventh category’s exposition**. The surname *Li* and its origin are elaborated in the **third category**. Now, the derivation of his taboo name, courtesy names, and posthumous title shall be sequentially explained.\n\nHis **taboo name** is *Ēr*, his **courtesy name** is *Pìn*, or alternatively *Bóyáng*, or his posthumous title is *Lǎo Pìn*.\nAs for human life, one has a **name**, a **courtesy name**, and a **posthumous title**; upon death, one receives a **posthumous title**. Some posthumous titles are conferred based on virtue, others symbolizing form. The *Lǎozǐ*’s ears were large and drooping—hence the posthumous title *Lǎo Pìn*. The *Lǎozǐ* was born with large ears, and three **leakages** (*sǎn lòu*), their appearance shameful and pendulous, marking the **distinctive mark of a great sage**. Thus, later generations posthumously titled him *Lǎo Pìn*, grounding the *Tàishàng*’s name, courtesy name, and posthumous title.\n\nAs for the **second section on the sovereign of the ten thousand heavens and teacher of the hundred kings**, the *Title* states: *\"According to Daoist scriptures, he emerged before the void’s formation, mastering the subtleties of natural transformation, and dwelled perpetually in the heavens, serving as the sovereign teacher of the emperors.\"* The **Daoist scriptures** refer to works such as the *Xuándū Bǎozàng*, *Sāndòng Sìfǔ*, and *Lóngzhāng Fèngzhuàn*—collectively termed *scriptures*. Within, it is said: *\"The *Tàishàng* emerged before the void’s formation, mastering the subtleties of natural transformation.\"* The term *stubbornly emerging* (*tǐng*) signifies surpassing all things in vitality and prominence. *Space* (*kōng*) means *emptiness*; *void* (*dòng*) means *permeation* and *nothingness*. Before the chaos of *Húntún*, in the silent interplay of *having* and *not-having*, only the boundless void pervaded naturally. According to the *Guǎng Shèngyì*: *\"The *Lǎojūn* originated from the beginningless, arising from no cause, as the first of all *Dao*s and the ancestor of *yuánqì*. At that time, there was no light, no form, no color, no sound, no origin, no thread—dim and obscure, hence called *space-void*.\"* It further states: *\"The *Lǎojūn*’s essence is *emptiness*, his nature *spontaneity*. Nothing could make him thus, nor could anything prevent it; he did not know why it was so, nor why it was not—hence *spontaneity*.\"* It speaks of the *Tàishàng Lǎojūn* having no supreme ancestor, his body being the *Dao* itself—condensing into form, dispersing as *qi*, embodying the subtleties of spontaneity, wielding authority over creation. Before the chaos had yet divided, in the space-void’s uppermost expanse, his *Dao*-body already distinctly emerged, manifesting at that time. The scripture states: *\"I know not whose child I am, preceding the August Sovereign\"*—this is the meaning.\n\nAs for **dwelling perpetually in the heavens**, it refers to his sojourn through the various heavens, serving as the teaching sovereign of the ten thousand heavens. According to the *Yóulóng Zhuàn*: *\"In antiquity, Yín Zhēnzhēn followed the *Lǎojūn* westward into the flowing sands, and upon returning, ascended with the sacred retinue to traverse the three realms and nine heavens, reaching the ten thousand heavens.\"* Each time the *Tàishàng* arrived at a heaven, he saw its imperial sovereigns, golden boys and jade girls, ten thousand chariots and a hundred thousand cavalry, jade banners and feathered canopies, celestial music filling the sky as they came to welcome him. Within that heaven, the *Tàishàng Lǎojūn* toured its palaces, expounding profound *dharma* to its inhabitants, serving as their teaching sovereign. Likewise, in every other heaven he visited, the ceremonies, music, feasts, palaces, and scriptural transmissions followed the same pattern, extending universally across the ten thousand heavens.\n\nAccording to the *Guǎng Shèngyì*: *\"The *Lǎojūn* also ascended to pay homage to *Yuánshǐ*, leveling his voice. He reported on sins and blessings, attended the *Yùchén* audience, recorded the nine palaces, and oversaw the registers of life and death across the three realms. Before him stood countless heavenly kings, seeking guidance on wind, rain, drought, famine, prosperity, adversity, life, death, virtue, and vice.\"* Thus, traversing the ten thousand heavens, he propagated the *Dao*’s transformations, ever-present in the *Tàichì* Palace of the *Tàichìng* Realm within the *Tàixiāng* Heaven. Hence, it is said he **dwelled perpetually in the heavens**.\n\nAs for **serving as the sovereign teacher of the emperors**, the *Guǎng Shèngyì* states: *\"During the era of the Three Sovereigns, humanity remained pure and unadorned.\"*\n\nIn the **Honglong** year of the **Dragon Han** era, he was titled *Xuánzhōng Dàfǎshī*, and with the *Shàngqīng Shèngjiào*—twelve volumes—he propagated the **Great Vehicle Dao** to enlighten both heaven and humanity.\n\nDuring the **Middle Three Sovereigns**, in the **Chiming** year of the **Red Bright** era, he was called *Yǒugǔ Xiānsheng*, and he revealed the *Língbǎo Zhēnjīng*—twelve volumes—expounding the **Middle Vehicle Law** to awaken all beings and rescue the myriad people.\n\nIn the **Lower Three Sovereigns** era, as human hearts grew scattered and crude, he descended in the **Kaihuang** year, taking the title *Jīnquè Dìjūn*, and revealed the *Dòngshén Zhēnjīng*—twelve volumes—propagating the **Lesser Vehicle Law** to enlighten all ranks of beings.\n\nThese thirty-six volumes of scriptures left behind during the **Upper, Middle, and Lower Three Sovereigns** eras were kept secret in the heavens and not transmitted to the world.\n\nAccording to the *Xuángāo Lùn·Shéndào Shèjiào Zhāng*: *\"Initially, the Dao was concealed in the Upper Mysteries; its final dissemination reached the Lower Earth.\"*\n\nLater, in the time of **Fuxi**, humanity had become licentious and undisciplined, lacking laws and rites. The *Lǎojūn* then, in the **Qingzhuo** year, assumed the title *Yùhuáchīzi*, descending as a teacher to instruct him in the *Yuányáng Jīng*, teaching Fuxi to draw the **Eight Trigrams**, thus elucidating the **virtue/power of the divine** and categorizing the **affections of all things**. He established **writing and contracts** to replace the **knotted cords** of governance, observing above and below to formulate the **Dao of marriage, filial piety, and human relationships**.\n\nIn the time of **Shennong**, humans consumed wild beasts, raw and uncooked, drinking blood and eating flesh. The *Lǎojūn* then, in the **Qinghan** year, took the title *Dàchéngzǐ*, descending as a teacher to expound the *Yuánjīng Jīng*, instructing them in the **Dao of cultivation and transformation**. Thus, he spread the **hundred grains** to replace roasting and slaughtering, blending the **hundred medicines** to treat the **hundred ailments**. Consequently, when he tasted the **mulberry**, he obtained **rice**; when he tasted the **willow**, he obtained **millet**; when he tasted the **elm**, he obtained **barley**; when he tasted the **sophora**, he obtained **beans**; when he tasted the **peach**, he obtained **small wheat**; when he tasted the **apricot**, he obtained **large wheat**; when he tasted the **hemp**, he obtained **hemp fiber**. As the **five grains** flourished, wild beasts were spared from harm, and the cessation of killing fostered **virtue**, while the removal of evil ensured **life’s preservation**. Without consuming blood and flesh, humanity knew no sickness; with the **five grains** nourishing their nature, no **past karma** remained. His benefits to humanity were immense.\n\nIn the time of **Zhufu**, humans still ate raw grains, unaware of cooked food. The *Lǎojūn* then, in the **Tianhan** year, took the title *Guǎngshòuzǐ*, descending as a teacher to expound the *Ànmó Tōngjīng Jīng*, instructing them in the **Dao of kneading and molding vessels** to transform raw grains. Thus, humanity could preserve their **lifespan**.\n\nFrom the **Lower Three Sovereigns** onward until the time of **Fuxi**, as humans lacked established rites and lived in undifferentiated herds like birds and beasts, the *Lǎojūn* propagated the **Dao’s transformations** across the world, gradually cultivating their **inner awareness**, distinguishing forms and flavors, and applying the **Five Phases**. He widely disseminated scriptures and exhorted the myriad people.\n\nAfter **Fuxi**, the *Lǎojūn* demonstrated **worldly methods**, establishing **rites and music** to differentiate **rank and hierarchy**, creating **garments and patterns** to distinguish **nobility and commonality**, and constructing **official buildings** to replace **nests and dens**, drawing from the **Great Boldness** trigram.\n\nHe fashioned **boats and carriages** to traverse what was impassable, drawing from the **Dispersion** trigram.\n\nHe instituted **coffins and burial shrouds**, and the **use of firewood for cremation**, drawing from the **Great Excess** trigram.\n\nThe *Lǎojūn* fashioned **bows and arrows** to subdue the disobedient, drawing from the **Opposition** trigram.\n\nHe established **laws and punishments** to deter ferocity, drawing from the **Biting** trigram.\n\nHe created **writing and contracts** to replace knotted cords, drawing from the **Center** trigram.\n\nAnd so came the use of **oxen for plowing and horses for riding**, harnessing weight to traverse great distances, drawing from the **Following** trigram.\n\nAt midday, markets were held for trade, then dissolved—again drawing from the **Biting** trigram.\n\nBefore the invention of **plows, pestles, and mortars**, their benefits were drawn from the **Increase** trigram.\n\nThe rule of **double gates and night patrols** was established, drawing from the **Joy** trigram.\n\nThus, the *Lǎojūn* instructed the sovereigns of his time, transforming the world through his teachings.\n\nIn the time of **Huangdi**, the *Lǎojūn* was known as **Guangchengzi**, residing on **Kongtong Mountain**. Huangdi sought him as master, and he expounded the *Daode Jing* and the *Dao Jie Jing*, teaching the **Way of governing the state and cultivating the self**. The Emperor followed these teachings, riding a fire-dragon to ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Here, the *Daode Jing* was first transmitted.\n\nIn the time of **Zhuànxū**, the *Lǎojūn* descended as teacher, known as **Chìjīngzi**, residing on **Hengshan**. He instructed the Emperor with the *Wéiyán Jing*, teaching the **Way of loyalty and submission**. The Emperor’s music was praised for its refinement.\n\nIn the time of **Yáo**, the *Lǎojūn* descended as teacher, known as **Lùtúzi**, residing by the riverside. He taught the Emperor the *Huángtíng Jing*, instructing in the **Way of purity and harmony**.\n\nIn the time of **Emperor Yáo**, the *Lǎojūn* descended as teacher, known as **Wùchéngzi**, residing on **Gūshè Mountain**, and taught the Emperor the *Zhèngshì Líhé Jing*, instructing in the **Way of cautious governance**.\n\nIn the time of **Shùn**, the *Lǎojūn* descended as teacher, known as **Yǐnshòuzi**, residing at **Héyáng**, and taught the Emperor the *Daode Jing*, instructing in the **Way of effortless filial piety and fraternal duty**. The Emperor followed these teachings, and the world conformed to his transformation. Hence, Confucius said, *\"The one who governs without action—was it not Shùn?\"* Thus, the *Daode Jing* was secondly transmitted here.\n\nIn the time of **Xià Yǔ**, the *Lǎojūn* descended as teacher, known as **Zhēnxíngzi**, residing in **Shāngshān**, and taught Yǔ the *Déjiè Jing*, instructing in the **Way of diligence and frugality**. He also transmitted the **Língbǎo Wǔfú** and the methods of **summoning ghosts and spirits**, and thus Yǔ followed them, dredging the Nine Rivers and Hundred Streams to connect the Jiang and the sea.\n\nIn the time of **Yīn Tāng**, the *Lǎojūn* descended as teacher, known as **Xīzézi**, residing on **Zhēnyīn Mountain** (also read as *Xúnshān*). He taught the Emperor the *Chángshēng Jing*, instructing in the **Way of reverence**.\n\n**Proclamation:**\nThe **Great Sage, True Primordial Ancestor**, born before the Great Cataclysm, came as teacher to the hundred kings, departed as sovereign of the ten thousand heavens. His scriptures bore countless names, his dragon-virtue pervaded the myriads—his praises are endless.\n\n**Note:** These are matters beyond the six directions—thus omitted in discussion.\nAs **Zhuangzi** says in the *Qíwùlùn*: *\"Beyond the six directions, the Sage exists yet does not speak of them.\"*\nThe six directions refer to heaven, earth, and the four cardinal points.\nWhat is spoken of here are matters beyond the six directions, not the scriptures of worldly affairs preserved in existence.\nThe Sage exists yet does not dare to censure or reject them, hence it is said: *\"exists yet does not speak of them.\"*\n\nThe note says: *\"Not their overstepping the mark\"*—taking the general principle.\nAs **Zhuangzi** says in the *Xiáoyáo Yóu*: *\"Greatly divergent from the path, far from human sentiment.\"*\n*\"Divergent\"* means excessive deviation.\n*\"Great medicine\"* refers to the grand framework.\nThese preceding teachings are all discussions of the transcendent—naturally distant from human sentiment.\nNot their excessive deviation, but merely outlining the grand framework.\nThus, the note says: *\"Matters beyond the six directions—thus omitted in discussion.\"*\n*\"Not their overstepping the mark\"*—merely citing the general principle.\n\nThe heading states: *\"The Mother of Laozi was impregnated by a great falling star and conceived. This was manifested in the Li lineage, born in the Shang dynasty, during the seventeenth year of the eighteenth Shang king, Yangjia, in a year of the cycle marked by Gēngshēn. She carried the embryo for eighty-one years, completing the nine-nine number of the Supreme Sun. His mother often wandered beneath the Li tree when Laozi was born. Laozi was born with white hair and thus could speak. Pointing to the Li tree, he said: 'This is my surname.' It is also said that his father’s surname was Li, with given names Wúguǒ or Língfēi. His mother was from the Yin clan, named Yìshòu. He was born in the ninth year of the twenty-second Shang king, Wǔdīng, on the fifteenth day of the second month at the hour of Mǎo, in a year of the cycle marked by Gēngchén.\"*\n\nThe commentary states: *\"This is the third section, clarifying the evidence of Laozi’s conception, gestation, and birth, including the era, year, month, and time. Within this section, there are two further divisions for elucidation. The first clarifies the dynasty, year, and season of conception and gestation. The second clarifies the origin of his surname and the era, year, month, and time of his birth.\"*\n\nThe first division, which clarifies the dynasty, year, and season of conception and gestation, states: *\"The mother of Laozi was impregnated by a great falling star and conceived, manifesting in the Li lineage.\"* According to the *Guang Sheng Yi* quoting the *Yuanjun Neichuan*, *\"Laozi, in Heaven, is the most honored of all sages. He taught long before the kalpa, maintaining the Dao of non-action as an eternal principle. He transformed into both celestial and human forms, born before countless kalpas, as the sovereign of all sages. Thus, the Yuan Shi Tianzun and Yùchén Dao Jun bestowed upon him the true title of Taishang Laojun, a name held since before the Five Sovereigns across countless kalpas. Though he repeatedly appeared as a teacher to emperors, he had yet to descend into the world and be born. Therefore, in the Nine Purity Realm above, he commanded the Mysterious Jade Maiden to descend into the human realm, becoming the daughter of the Tian Shui Yin clan, marrying Li Lingfei as his wife. Laozi, riding the solar essence and driving a nine-dragon chariot, transformed into a five-colored flowing pearl—or a falling star—and descended into the Mysterious Jade Maiden’s mouth, gestating within her for eighty-one years.\"*\n\nAgain, according to the *Guang Sheng Yi*, *\"The one who gestated in wisdom was Laozi, who, pitying the decay of the age, wished to conceal his sageliness and blend with the common, returning to manifest form to save the world. Thus, in the seventeenth year of the eighteenth Shang king, Yangjia, in a year of Gēngshēn, he took form in the womb of the Mysterious Jade Maiden.\"*\n\nWithin this section, there are five further distinctions:\n1. The Great Dao manifested and took human form, gestating within a mortal, riding the solar essence as a five-colored symbol, thus illustrating the virtue of the Supreme Sun.\n2. Riding the nine-dragon chariot, he condensed and transformed into five-colored mystic yellow, descending into the Mysterious Jade Maiden’s mouth, further illustrating the essence of the nine dragons and the yang vitality.\n3. The gestation period in wisdom differed from the common—eighty-one years, completing the nine-nine number of the Supreme Sun, before birth.\n4. After the Mysterious Jade Maiden conceived, her appearance grew younger, her spirit serene and at ease. For eighty-one years, she was joyous beyond compare—this was the extraordinary mark of the Sage’s descent.\n5. The chamber where the holy mother resided was perpetually harmonious in all seasons, with the six qi balanced—no bitter cold in winter, no oppressive heat in summer. Auspicious light filled the room, sacred winds swept the courtyard, no evil intruded, and all spirits guarded in secret. Thus, eighty-one years passed unnoticed, demonstrating how the great Sage’s conception and gestation differed from that of mortals.\n\nThis is the evidence for the Supreme Sage’s conception, gestation, dynasty, and season.\n\nThus, the heading states: *\"The mother of Laozi was impregnated by a great falling star and conceived, manifesting in the Li lineage.\"*\n\nThe second division, which clarifies the origin of his surname and the era, year, month, and time of his birth, states: *\"His holy mother often wandered beneath the Li tree when Laozi was born. Laozi was born with white hair and thus could speak. Pointing to the Li tree, he said: 'This is my surname.'\"*\n\nWhen the Sage was betrothed in the Shang dynasty, pitying the decay of the age, he wished to descend as a mortal, manifesting his form to save the world. Thus, he temporarily borrowed a womb to gestate and give birth, greatly displaying his divine transformations to benefit the world. According to the *Benji*, his father’s surname was Li, with given names Wúguǒ, Língfēi, or Qiánhuì. His mother was from the Yin clan, named Yìshòu. In the ninth year of the twenty-second Shang king, Wǔdīng, on the fifteenth day of the second month at the hour of Mǎo, the holy mother happened to be wandering beneath the Li tree when she gave birth to Laozi by splitting her left armpit. Laozi was born able to speak, pointing to the Li tree and saying: *\"This is my surname.\"* He then raised his hand, pointing up and down, declaring: *\"Above Heaven, below Heaven, only I am supreme. The sufferings of the world—what joy is there in hearing them? I shall expound the Dao and its laws, universally liberating all sentient beings—animals and plants alike—throughout the ten directions, reaching even the deepest prisons. All who have not yet been liberated shall be liberated.\"*\n\nThen, countless true sages filled the void, all coming to guard and protect him. The holy ones in the sky praised him with ten titles:\n1. Taishang Laojun (The Supreme Venerable Lord)\n2. Yuánshénzhì (The Circular Spirit Sage)\n3. Wúshàngzūn (The Peerless Sovereign)\n4. Dìwángshī (The Emperor’s Teacher)\n5. Dàzhàngfū (The Great Man)\n6. Dàxiānzūn (The Venerable Immortal)\n7. Tiānrénfù (The Father of Heaven and Man)\n8. Wúwéishàngrén (The Supreme One of Non-Action)\n9. Dàcírézhě (The Great Compassionate and Benevolent One)\n10. Zhēnyuànjiàozhǔ (The True Primordial Master of Teaching)\n\nThese are the ten titles by which the holy sages in the void praised him.\n\nSuddenly, the nine dragons spat water to bathe his sacred form, and where the water fell, nine wells formed. Today, in the Taqing Palace of Bozhou, they are called the Nine-Dragon Wells, and they remain to this day. This is also as described in the *Huà Hú Jīng*.\n\nIndeed, the great Sage’s descent into the world was marked by such extraordinary signs.\n\nAs for the origin of Laozi’s surname Li, the accounts vary greatly.\n\n「Now let us examine the *Great Tang Celestial Filings of the Jade Register* which states: The Sage’s ancestors were originally descendants of **Zhuānxū** (顛顼).\nZhuānxū begot **Dàyè** (大業), who begot **Wāyīn Guā** (娲音瓜).\nWāyīn married a daughter of the **Qiáo** (乔) clan, and upon being illuminated by the **Moonlight of Acclaim** (感月光贯昂), gave birth to **Jiùyáo** (咎繇), whose name was pronounced **Gāo** (皋).\nJiùyáo was pronounced **Yáo** (姚), and he begot **Bóyì** (伯翳).\nBóyì begot **Lǐzhēng** (理征), whose descendants became **shìshī** (士师, officials/judges).\nWhen Lǐzhēng fled the chaos of **Jié** (桀), he retreated to the ruins of **Yīhóu** (伊侯) and sustained himself on **lǐ fruit** (李实), thus changing his surname from **Lǐ** (理) to **Lǐ** (李).\nThis account states that Jiùyáo’s descendants took **Lǐ** (理) as their surname due to their merit in administering justice, and later, some descendants became the **Lǐ** (里) clan.\nIt was only when they sought refuge in the ruins of Yīhóu that they changed the surname **Lǐ** (里) to **Lǐ** (李).\nLǐzhēng begot **Lìzhēn** (利贞), who lived in the time of **Yīn Shāng** (殷汤).\nLìzhēn begot **Chāngzǔ** (昌祖), who served as a **great official** (大夫) in the state of **Chén** (陈) and settled in **Kǔ County** (苦县).\nChāngzǔ begot **Míng** (明), who became the **Chancellor** (相) of Chén and was enshrined in a temple north of **Lài Xiāng** (濑乡), giving rise to **Xiàngchéng** (相城).\nMíng begot **Qìngbīn** (庆宾), who begot **Língfēi** (灵飞), also known as **Qiánhuì** (虔会).\nBoth Qìngbīn and Língfēi ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\nThe text earlier mentions that they took the **plum tree** (桃树, *táoshù*) as their surname, hence the surname **Lǐ** (李).\nExamining this, the surname may have been **Lǐ** (理), **Lǐ** (里), or **Lǐ** (李), though their pronunciations were the same, their characters differed.\nThis shifting of surnames according to different eras is not reliable.\nOnly the account of taking the **plum tree** (桃树) as the surname, as attested by **Master Dù Tiānshī** (杜天师), is correct.\n\nAccording to **Xuē Dàohéng** (薛道衡) of the **Sui Dynasty** in his *Laozi Stele* (《老君碑》):\n*\"Illuminated by the sun at his birth, his origins in receiving qi are unfathomable.\nHe took the **plum tree** (桃树) as his surname, yet the source of his **blowing the bamboo flute and establishing the Dao** (吹律之本) remains unclear.\"*\n\nThus, the account of taking the **plum tree** (桃树) as his surname seems most plausible.\n\nNext, let us consider the accounts of his descent and birth era.\nAccording to the *Comprehensive Meanings of the Holy Saints* (《广圣义》):\nThe Sage Laozi is the **originator of the Dao** (至道之祖), the **founder of primordial transformation** (元化之宗).\nHe existed before the **uppermost antiquity** (上古) yet was not its earliest, and after the **final age** (末代) yet was not its latest.\nHow much more so before countless **kalpas** (劫)!\nHe already propagated the Dao and its teachings, so how could one say he was born from a womb and thus claim it as his birth?\nWhen we speak of his descent, it is to manifest his presence in the human world and demonstrate that he had a beginning.\nHis birth form was the **Holy Mother** (圣母), showing that he had a birth.\nThe Holy Mother served the **Primordial Lord** (元君), indicating his exalted status.\nNow, examining the various scriptures, his descent and birth are recorded in three instances.\n\nThe first descent and birth:\nIn the **seventh year of the reign of Shānhé** (上和七年), during the **year of Gēngyín** (庚寅) in the ninth month on the **third day of Jiǎzǐ** (甲子),\nhe was born between the **Lǐ Valley** (李谷) and **Huánguǎn Língjìng Mountain** (玄罡灵镜山) in the **Northern Mystic Realm** (北玄女国).\nThe Holy Mother was called **Mother of Mystic Void** (玄虚之母).\nAt the time of his birth, three suns emerged from the east, and nine dragons spat water to bathe his form.\nHe thus took his name from the Lǐ Valley, being called **Huángyuán** (玄元), with the **character name Zǐguāng** (子光).\nHe was the **highest of the exalted** (高上之冑), the **offspring of the Jade Sovereign** (玉皇之胤),\nand held the title **Lord of Supreme Longevity, Great Master of Peace, True One of Grand Unity, and the Golden Gate Sage Emperor** (长生大主太平正真太一君金阙后圣九玄帝君).\n\nUpon careful examination, this was also before the kalpa, with **Zhūlíng Shānhé** (朱灵上和) as the reign title of the previous kalpa.\n\nThe second descent and birth:\nIn the **ninth year of the twenty-second sovereign of Yīn** (殷之二十二王武丁九年), during the **year of Gēngchén** (庚辰) in the second month on the **fifteenth day at the hour of Mǎo** (卯时),\nhe was born.\nThe Holy Mother was called **Mystic Marvelous Jade Maiden** (玄妙玉女), who was the **Teacher of the Supreme Deity** (上帝之师),\nlater ascending to the title **Primordial Lord of Grand Unity** (太一元君).\nThis account, upon careful review, corresponds to the era of his descent in **Bózhōu** (亳州).\nIt is the same as the **Taqing Palace** (太清宫) in present-day **Wèizhēn County** (卫真县), marking the site of his descent and birth.\n\nAccording to **Huángfǔ Shì'ān** (皇甫士安)'s *Long Chronicle* (长历), the **year of Jiǎzǐ** (甲子) is confirmed.\n**Master Gé Xiānshī** (葛仙公) stated that the **Grand Age** (太岁) was **Dīngmǎo** (丁卯),\nindicating the era of the **Chou Dynasty** (周师).\nThis was the **first year of King Zhòu** (纣元年, **Dīngwèi** 丁未) to the **twenty-first year of King Zhòu** (纣二十一年, **Dīngmǎo** 丁卯).\nLaozi resided on the **south-facing slope of Qíshān Mountain** (岐山之阳) as the **Teacher of King Xī of Chou** (周西伯之师),\nand was known as **Zǐ of Xiānyì** (燮邑子).\nFrom the ninth year of Yīn Wǔdīng (殷武丁九年, **Gēngchén** 庚辰) to the twenty-first year of King Zhòu (纣二十一年, **Dīngmǎo** 丁卯),\nspanning **one hundred and eighty years**.\nHe then ascended to heaven in the **twenty-fifth year of King Zhāo** (昭王二十五年, **Guǐchǒu** 癸丑) in the fourth month on the **twenty-eighth day**,\nafter which, in the **year of Yǐmǎo** (乙卯), he manifested a **divine incarnation** (分身降) near the **western bank of Jǐnjiāng River** (锦江之滨) in **Xīshǔ** (西蜀),\ntaking residence in the home of a **great official** (大官).\nIn the **twenty-ninth year of King Zhāo** (昭王二十九年, **Dīngsì** 丁巳),\n**Yín Xǐ** (尹喜) arrived in Shǔ.\nOriginally, there was no **green sheep market** (青羊肆),\nbut when the **Primordial Sage** (太上) was in the **Tàiwéi constellation** (太微), he first exerted his influence over the **Green Boy** (青童) of the **Green Emperor** (青帝),\ndescending to the capital of Shǔ and transforming into a **green sheep** (青羊).\nYín Xǐ saw a man leading it, and suddenly realized:\n*\"Since there is a green sheep, and it is being led to its market, this must be the Primordial Sage’s arrangement.\"*\nHe then asked the man leading the sheep:\n*\"To which family does this sheep belong?\"*\nThe man replied:\n*\"My wife, though she has reached old age, gave birth to a child whose crying never ceases.\nShe cast him into water and fire, yet neither could harm him.\nA **Daoist practitioner** (道者) said:\n'If you let the green sheep nurse him, his crying will stop.'\"*\n\nThe third descent and birth:\nAccording to the *Yóulóng Transmission* (《犹龙传》) quoting the *Húnyuán Original Records* (《混元本纪》):\nThe **Primordial Sage** (太上) ascended to heaven in the **year of Jiǎyín** (甲寅) of King Zhāo of Chou (周昭王).\nThis was the **twenty-sixth year** (二十六年) of King Zhāo, yet the month and day of his ascension were not recorded.\nLater, in the **commentary by Zāng Qú** (张渠) on the *Northern Dipper Scripture* (《北斗经》) seen in **Xīshǔ** (西蜀),\nit states:\n*\"The Primordial Sage ascended to heaven in the twenty-sixth year of King Zhāo of Chou (周昭王二十六年, **Jiǎyín** 甲寅), on the fourth month’s twenty-eighth day.\nIn the year of **Yǐmǎo** (乙卯), he manifested a divine incarnation near the western bank of Jǐnjiāng River (锦江之滨) in Xīshǔ,\ntaking residence in the home of a great official.\"*\n\nThe **Primordial Sage** then said, *\"I dwell in the **Tàiwēi** [Great Pivot], my true form is **Zhēnyī** [True Unity], **Tàihé** [Great Harmony] descends in purity, and my radiant spirit manifests as a human. As host and guest mutually arise, I leave my trace here—why should you find it strange?\"*\n\n**Yǐn Xǐ** then knelt and bowed twice, saying, *\"This is a joyous assembly, and I humbly present myself before Your Heavenly Presence. May I ask if Your Benevolent Majesty has come forth or remains within, and if You dwell in peace?\"*\n\nThe **Primordial Sage** smiled and replied, *\"Since we parted, what have you gained or lost? You have preserved the **Dao/Way** and guarded the **One**—how could this not be beneficial?\"*\n\n**Yǐn Xǐ** said, *\"I have reverently served the **secret essentials**, and through them, I have attained their mysteries. Your saving grace surpasses even that of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nThe **Primordial Sage** declared, *\"I once left you to dwell in this world. After a thousand days of pure fasting, I awaited you here. Now you have preserved your form and refined your **qi**, already reaching the **Míngmiào** [Dark Mysteries], and your heart is bound by the **zǐluò** [purple snares], while your face bears the **yuánmíng** [circular clarity]. Your golden name is inscribed in the **true diagram**, and your jade **zhá** [tablet] is tied to the **purple chamber**. Your **qi** harmonizes with **Tàiwēi**, and your form dissolves into **Zhēnyī**—thus you are now qualified to serve.\"*\n\nUpon finishing his words, the **sacred beings of the Three Realms** (三界圣真) arrived with ten thousand chariots and a hundred thousand horsemen floating through the air. They then bestowed upon **Yǐn Xǐ**:\n- the **zǐfúróng** [purple lotus-crown],\n- the **fēiqīngyǔ** [flying green-feathered skirt],\n- the **dānzhǔlǜshǒu** [crimson gaze and verdant sleeves],\n- the **jiāodài nícháng** [crossed sash of rainbow clouds],\n- the **luówén huángguǎ** [embroidered robe with yellow belt],\nand appointed him as **Wénshǐ** [Origin of Scriptures] **Master**, granting him the title of **Wúshàng Zhēnrén** [Supreme True Person]. From that time onward, he was permitted to attend the **Lóngchē** [Dragon Chariot], freely traversing the heavens above and the earth below.\n\nThe **Primordial Sage** then ascended his seat and expounded the *Yuányáng Scripture* (《元阳经》) to the mother, who resided in the southwest of **Chéngdū** by several hundred paces. In the **second year of Zhōnghé** (中和二年), he received the **Língchuán** [Divine Transmission] edict and established the **Qīngyáng Temple** (青羊宫).\n\nThis was indeed the **third descent and birth** in accordance with the decree.\n\nNow, the passage cited in this section refers to the **second descent and birth** in **Bózhōu** [Bozhou].\n\nThe text states:\n*\"The **Primordial Sage**’s stature was eight *chǐ* and eight *cùn* tall, with a yellow complexion. His holy visage was golden, hence ‘yellow’ is mentioned. His forehead was broad (广颡), and his ears were large and drooping (聃耳). His eyes were vast, seeing all (大目). His teeth were wide and well-spaced (疏齿). His mouth was square (方口), not meaning its shape was four-sided, but that he spoke of **Dao/Way** and righteousness (道义) with precision. Even **Confucius** was called ‘river-eyed and sea-mouthed’ (河目海口), both being marks of the sage’s extraordinary features. His lips were thick (厚唇), and his brow bore the **sānyùdálǐ** [three-five enlightened patterns]—‘lǐ’ meaning ‘text’ or ‘mark.’ His brow seemed to bear the characters ‘three-five’ (三五), a luminous script. His forehead also resembled the **rìjiǎo yuèxuán** [sun-horn and moon-eyebrow], as if the sun and moon were inscribed there—near or far, deep or shallow, they illuminated all without being physically present. His face was full and round like a moon. His nose had a double ridge (鼻有双骨), indicating three nasal openings (三窍). His ears also had three openings (耳有三漏). His feet bore the **èrwǔ** [two-noon] marks (足蹈二午), and his hands held the **shíwén** [ten-characters] (手握十文). This means each hand had ten characters’ worth of markings, much like **Great Yù** (大禹), whose left hand bore the character ‘water’ (水), and right hand bore ‘platform’ (台), combining to form ‘governance’ (治). These are the extraordinary features of the sage. His **qi** was supremely pure, and his received form was most unusual. Indeed, from ancient times, sages have all possessed extraordinary features—how much more so for the **Primordial Sage**, who embodies the **greatest virtue/power** (大圣之德), with seventy-two **ruìxiàng** [auspicious marks] and eighty-one **zhǒnghǎo** [distinct virtues]? His celestial visage was dignified, and his holy features were uniquely refined; though I cannot enumerate them all, they certainly exceed these few examples.\"*\n\nThe second part clarifies the **Primordial Sage**’s birthplace:\n*\"The **Primordial Sage** was born in **Chǔguó** [State of Chu], **Kǔ County** (苦县), **Làiyáng Township** (濑阳乡), **Qǔrén Village** (曲仁里), beside the **Wō Water** (涡水). According to the *Tàidīng Yùjié* (大唐天渍玉牒) of the **Táng Dynasty** (大唐), the sage’s ancestor, **Chāngzǔ** (昌祖), served as a great official under the **Chén Dynasty** (陈) and settled in **Kǔ County**. **Chāngzǔ**’s son, **Míng** (明), became the **Chén Dynasty**’s chancellor and was buried north of **Làiyáng Township**—a temple was then established there. Today’s reference to **Chǔguó** may suggest **Yǐngzhōu** (郢州), which was ancient **Chu**. **Kǔ County** was its subordinate jurisdiction.\n\nAdditionally, in **Bózhōu** (亳州), **Chéngfǔ County** (城父县) to the east by thirty *lǐ*, there is the **Tiānjìng Temple** (天静官), where the **sage-mother** conceived. A **flowing star** (流星) is said to have appeared at the **original daytime chamber** (原昼寝堂) there. **Chéngfǔ County** was also part of ancient **Chu**.\n\nExamine closely: the **Primordial Sage** conceived in the **Tiānjìng Temple** of **Chéngfǔ**, descended in the **Tàiqīng Temple** (太清宫) of **Kǔ County**. **Kǔ County** was the ancient name of the region. During the **Hàn** and **Wèi** eras, it became **Gǔyáng County** (谷阳县). By the **first year of Qiánfēng** (乾封元年) in the **Táng Dynasty**, it was renamed **Zhēnyuán County** (真源县). In the **second year of Zhōnghé** (中和二年), it was elevated to **Chì County** (赤县). During the reign of **Emperor Zhēnzōng of Sòng** (宋真宗朝), it was changed to **Wèizhēn County** (卫真县), which is today’s **Wèizhēn County** (卫真县), **Làiyáng Township** (濑阳乡), **Gǔyáng Town** (谷阳镇). The **Tàiqīng Temple** (太清宫) is the place.\"*\n\nThe **Wōshuǐ** region on its **yin** side—now the **Tàiqīng Temple** on the right bank of the **Wō River**—hence called *yin* (or *bīn*, meaning \"bank\"). This was the homeland where the **Primordial Sage** dwelled.\n\n---\n**Dao/Way and Virtue Classic** *Cángwēi* [藏微] *Closed* **Exegesis** *Kēwén* [科文] *Commentary* **Volume II** concluded.\n**Dao/Way and Virtue Classic** *Zuǎnwēi* [纂微] *Opened* **Exegesis** *Kēwén* [科文] *Commentary* **Volume III**\nAttributed to **Lǎoxiá Lǎorén** (太霞老人) **Xuè Zhèngxuān** (薛政玄)\n\n**Title:** In the **21st year of Zhòu** (纣), the year **Dīngmǎo** (丁卯), the **Primordial Sage** resided at the **southern slope of Qíshān**. The **Western King** (西伯) heard of him and appointed him **Guardian of the Archives**. After the **Wǔ King** conquered the **Shāng**, he was transferred to **Pillar-Beneath Historian**. Through the reigns of **Chéng** and **Kāng**, he remained in obscurity, holding a lowly rank.\n\nHaving long resided in **Zhōu**, he observed its decline and thus retired from office. In the **25th year of Zhāowáng** (昭王), the year **Guǐchǒu** (癸丑), on the **29th day of the 5th month**, at the hour **Rénwǔ** (壬午), he mounted the **Qīngniú** (青牛) and boarded the **Bóchāng** (薄章) carriage, with **Xú Jiǎ** (徐甲) as his charioteer, and departed from **Zhōu**.\n\n**Commentary:** This is the **Fifth Gate**, illuminating the **Hidden Sage’s** unity with the common and his retreat into lowly office to assist the ruling sovereign, as well as the year of his departure from **Zhōu**.\n\nWithin this gate, it further divides into two:\n1. **Illuminating his retreat into lowly office.**\n2. **Illuminating the year of his departure from Zhōu.**\n\n**First: Illuminating his retreat into lowly office.**\nAs titled: *\"In the 21st year of Zhòu...\"* until *\"and thus retired from office.\"*\n\nThe **Qíshān** of old was **Qíxiáng Fǔ** (凤翔府) **Qíshān County** (岐山县) of today. It was the domain where **Wénwáng**, as **Xībó** (西伯), once resided. *Bó* (伯) refers to the fifth rank of nobility. In the latter years of **Zhòu**, **Wénwáng** governed **Qíshān** as the sovereign of the **Western lands**, possessing **sage virtue**. Many people’s hearts were drawn to him, hence **Confucius** in the *Lǔyǔ* remarked: *\"The virtue of **Zhōu** may indeed be called the utmost virtue.\"*\n\nHe held two-thirds of the realm yet served the **Yīn**. At that time, **Lǎozǐ** resided on the southern slope of **Qíshān**, known as **Xièyì Zǐ** (燮邑子), observing the **Western King’s** governance. When **Wénwáng** heard of him, he summoned **Lǎozǐ** to serve as **Guardian of the Archives**. He composed the *Chìjīng* (赤精经) and taught the **Dao/Way of benevolence and trustworthiness**. **Wénwáng** put it into practice, honoring the worthy and cherishing righteousness, and the **phoenix gathered at Qíshān**. As the *Lǐjì* states: *\"When **Zhōu** rose, the phoenix sang on the mountains. The phoenix bathed in the streams.\"* It cried at **Qíyáng**, and thus **Qíshān** became the name of the county, and **Fèngxiáng** the name of the prefecture.\n\nEighteen *lǐ* north of **Fèngxiáng City** lies the **Primordial Sage’s** former residence, where the **Táng Dynasty** later built the **Qǐshèng Gōng** (启圣宫).\n\nAfter the **Wǔ King** conquered **Yīn**, **Lǎozǐ** was titled **Yùchéng Zǐ** (育成子) and composed the *Xuánjī Jīng* (璇玑经). The **Wǔ King** took him as his teacher and thus attained the **Mandate of Heaven**. During **Chéngwáng’s** reign, he was called **Jīngchéng Zǐ** (经成子). In **Kāngwáng’s** time, he was known as **Guōshū Zǐ** (郭叔子). **Lǎozǐ** remained as **Pillar-Beneath Historian**. When **Zhāowáng** ascended, the **Primordial Sage**, seeing that **Zhōu’s Dao/Way** was declining, retired from office.\n\nFrom **Wénwáng** to **Zhāowáng**, he served **Zhōu** for generations, still holding the office of historian. Hence, it is said: *\"Having long resided in **Zhōu**, he remained in obscurity, holding a lowly rank, to assist the ruling sovereign.\"*\n\n**Second: Illuminating the year of his departure from Zhōu.**\nAs titled: *\"In the 25th year of Zhāowáng...\"* until *\"and thus departed from Zhōu.\"*\n\nThis marks the year of his departure from **Zhōu**. The **Bóchāng** was a light carriage, and **Xú Jiǎ** was the charioteer for the **Primordial Sage**—surname **Xú**, given name **Jiǎ**. The **Primordial Sage** said to him: *\"I wish to travel westward to the **Great Qin** of the **Western Sea**, **Jībīn** (罽宾), **Tiānzhú** (天竺), and **Ānxī** (安息). Now you shall drive my carriage, and I will pay you a daily wage of one hundred coins. When you return from those lands, I will repay you in gold—how does that sound?\"*\n\nJiǎ agreed and, driving the carriage from **Hángǔ Gǔ** (函谷) to the foot of **Zhōngnán Shān**, set forth.\n\n**The Primordial Sage** sought to test him, so he commanded **Xú Jiǎ** to tend the green ox in the wild. With auspicious herbs, he transformed himself into a maiden of surpassing beauty and grace.\n\nWhen Jiǎ reached the place where he tended the ox, he jestingly spoke to her. Jiǎ was bewildered by her words. Since **The Primordial Sage** had departed westward to the **Western Sea** and would not return, Jiǎ broke their agreement. He falsified his words and went to the **Guān Lìng** (关令), presenting a writ to demand payment for his service.\n\n**The Primordial Sage** said to him: *\"You have followed me for over two hundred years, and I should repay you seven hundred twenty million coins. Moreover, your lifespan had already expired long ago—I used the **Tàixuān** (太玄) talisman to grant you renewed life. Why do you not remember this? Return the talisman to me, and I will repay you in gold.\"*\n\nAs he finished speaking, the talisman flew from his mouth and landed before **The Primordial Sage**, its inscriptions as fresh as ever. Jiǎ had once more turned into a withered skeleton. The **Guān Lìng** pitied Jiǎ for defying his true intent and dying again, and wished to witness **The Primordial Sage**’s method of reviving the dead. He knelt and humbly pleaded before him:\n\n*\"Though Jiǎ’s wages were paid gladly in advance, I beg **The Great Sage** to have mercy and pardon his transgressions, granting him another life. That would be most fortunate.\"*\n\n**The Primordial Sage** accepted his words and once again cast the talisman into Jiǎ’s skeletal remains, restoring him as before.\n\n**The Primordial Sage** then said: *\"I do not blame you. You abandoned our original agreement, and the Dao/Way left you. Thus, you died. Now I repay your wages and would send you away.\"*\n\nJiǎ fell to the ground, striking his cheeks and saying: *\"I have already received **The Sage’s** boundless grace, and though my faults were forgiven, this withered form has now seen the light again. The memory is etched into my bones—I beg to follow **The Sage’s** celestial carriage!\"*\n\n**The Primordial Sage** ultimately did not grant permission, yet Jiǎ still followed him. This marks the year of **The Primordial Sage**’s departure from **Zhōu**, the reason being that **Xú Jiǎ** served as his charioteer.\n\n**Titled:** *\"Guān Lìng Yín Xǐ\"* (关令尹喜), a **Great Official** of **Zhōu**.\n\nSurname **Yín**, given name **Xǐ**, with the courtesy name **Gōngyáng** (公阳). He authored nine volumes, expounding on **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**. His inner studies encompassed the **xīngxiàng** (星象) and **fúwéi** (服精华), meaning the essence of the sun and moon. He was known for his benevolence and hidden **virtue/power**, though common folk knew little of him.\n\nIt was also said: *\"Xǐ’s mother never slept by day. In a dream, she saw celestial light descend like lightning, enveloping her body, and only then did she conceive Xǐ.\"* When Xǐ was born, he had twin radiant lights like the sun hovering beside him. His eyes gleamed with solar brilliance, and his form was tall and beautiful. He was deeply versed in the classics and skilled in **astronomy** and **mystical omens**. Whether gazing upward or downward, he penetrated all mysteries—even the shifts of **ghosts and gods** could not conceal their true nature from him. Yet he possessed a vast and magnanimous spirit, did not observe conventional etiquette, and was generous in love, humble in nature, and compassionate. He often sacrificed his own comfort to aid others. When inside, he was a guest and friend of the **Eastern Palace** (东宫); when outside, he served as **Guān Lìng** of **Hángǔ Gǔ**. Ever gazing at the heavens, he harbored thoughts of ascending to the **emptiness**.\n\nBefore **Lǎozi** arrived at the pass, Xǐ ascended the tower and looked in all four directions. He saw a **purple qi** (紫气) drifting eastward and moving westward, knowing that a **True Person** (真人) would soon pass through the capital. He then ordered his guards to be vigilant, swept the path, and burned incense, awaiting the omen.\n\n**Commentary:** *\"This is the sixth section, which reveals **Yín Xǐ’s** true origins and how he discerned the **qi** and stars, knowing the **Great Sage** would cross the pass. The deeds of the **True Person** and the omens of **The Primordial Sage**’s passage are already detailed in the title—no further elucidation is needed.\"*\n\n**Titled:** *\"By the 12th day of the 7th month, on the cycle of **Jiāzǐ** (甲子), **Lǎozi** arrived at the pass. Xǐ knelt with hands raised and bowed deeply, inviting **Lǎozi** to his residence. He offered him a towel, comb, and water for washing and rinsing, then fasted and inquired about the **Dao/Way**. By the 25th day of the 12th month, Xǐ resigned his post under the pretext of illness. On the 28th day, **Lǎozi** gave him two volumes on **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.\"*\n\nXǐ bowed his head and begged to follow **Lǎozi** westward across the **flowing sands** (流沙). **Lǎozi** replied: *\"You have not yet attained it—how can you follow me far into the **flowing sands**? The lands beyond are strange, and the uncivilized peoples are difficult to transform. What method can you employ to resist evil?\n\nOnly when the **Dao/Way** is born within your belly and **spiritual clarity** (神明) is preserved can you remove defilements and cease restless thoughts, quiet your mind and hold fast to **Oneness** (一), maintain a thousand days of pure fasting, refine your form into perfection, and then you may seek me in **Chéngdū’s** (蜀都) **Qīngyáng Market** (青羊之肆). Otherwise, how could you?\"*\n\nXǐ bowed repeatedly and expressed gratitude. Suddenly, **Lǎozi** ascended into the sky, rising gradually toward **Tàiwēi** (太微).\n\nXǐ waited until the radiant light dispersed and the atmosphere grew still and empty. He then resided in the tower, fasting in solitude, excluding all servants and children. For three years, he recited the **sūtras**, and for a thousand days, he focused his mind with unwavering resolve. His spirit concentrated, his form dissolved, and his bones and flesh merged completely. In time, he mastered the subtleties of **counting the dharma** (穷数) and **reaching the transformations** (达变), and understood all the marvels of **changing form and essence** (因形移易).\n\nThus, he abandoned his home and left his lodgings, ascending freely and loftily. When he arrived at **Qīngyáng Market**, he met **Lǎozi**. **Lǎozi** then appointed him as **Wénshǐ** (文始) Master and together they journeyed into the **flowing sands** domain.\n\n**Commentary:** *\"This is the seventh section, which reveals the time **The Primordial Sage** spent at the pass transmitting the **sūtras**, as well as their second meeting at **Qīngyáng Market**. Within this section, there are two parts: the first clarifies the time of transmission at the pass; the second clarifies their second meeting at **Qīngyáng Market**.\"*\n\n**First:** *\"The 12th day of the 7th month, on the cycle of **Jiāzǐ**, **Lǎozi** arrived at the pass, and Xǐ knelt with hands raised and bowed deeply.\"*\n\nAs in *The Zhuangzi’s* **\"Rénjiānshì\"** (人间世): *\"Yán Huí daily knelt with hands raised and bowed deeply—this was the etiquette of a subject.\"* **Knèng** (擎) refers to raising the hands, **jì** (跽) to kneeling on the knees, and **qūquán** (曲拳) to bending the torso.\n\n**Second:** *\"The transmission of the two volumes on **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.\"*\n\nAccording to *The Yín Xǐ Inner Transmission* (尹喜内传): *\"The **True Person** was originally a **Great Official** of **Zhōu Kāngwáng** (周康王). Skilled in observing celestial omens, he constructed a tower of grass at his residence—this is the **Lóuguān** (楼观) beneath **Zhōngnán Shān** today. Every time he ascended the tower to gaze, he saw the **purple qi** (紫气) hover over the pass, the **fusion wind** (融风) arrive three times, and the **Tianlǐ Star** (天理星) move westward, thus knowing that a **Sage** would cross the pass. By the time of **Zhāowáng** (昭王), he was requested to leave and become **Guān Lìng** of **Hángǔ Gǔ**. He swept the path, burned incense, and awaited the omen, ordering his guards, including **Sūn Jǐng** (孙景), sternly: ‘If any carriage or attire is unusual, or any figure bears extraordinary appearance, do not allow them to pass. Report it to me immediately.’\"*\n\nWhen **Zhāowáng**’s twenty-fifth year, the **Gengchǒu** (癸丑) month of the seventh month, the **Jiazi** (甲子) day, **Lǎojūn** (老君) rode the **Green Ox Cart** (青牛之车), with **Xú Jiǎ** (徐甲) as his charioteer, accompanied by **Wújí** (无极) Master, **Guǐgǔ** (鬼谷) Master, and **Tàijí** (太极) Master, arriving at the pass to seek passage.\n\nThe gatekeeper, **Sūn Jǐng** (孙景), said: *\"My lord has instructed me—please, sir, stay a moment longer.\"*\n\nHe then entered to report to the **Guān Lìng** (关令), saying: *\"There is an old man with a white head and long ears, riding a Green Ox Cart with a thatched carriage from the east, seeking passage.\"*\n\n**Yǐn Xǐ** (喜) replied: *\"The Sage has come! I must see him.\"*\n\nHe immediately donned his **morning court attire** (朝服) and went out to greet him, performing the **rites of a disciple** (具弟子礼), and invited him, saying: *\"I pray the Sage may briefly pause his divine journey.\"*\n\n**Lǎojūn** declined, saying: *\"I am a humble and lowly old man. My home lies east of the pass, my fields west of it. Now I am merely going to gather firewood—why must you detain me? Grant me passage, and I shall trouble you no further. If you insist on this, I fear you may regret it later.\"*\n\n**Lǎojūn**’s words of humility were his **first test** (此一试也).\n\n**Yǐn Xǐ** bowed again and said: *\"I humbly suggest you not go to the Western Estate. Please, briefly pause your divine journey.\"*\n\n**Lǎojūn** spoke once more: *\"I have opened the **Dao** for **Zhú Qián** (竺乾). There is an ancient Master skilled in entering **wuwei** (无为), who neither ends nor begins, whose **liánjié** (绵绵) spans eternal **kalpas** (劫). Therefore, I ascend to the **Dao scriptures** (道经) and pass through the gates. Why would you dare to detain me?\"*\n\nThis was his **second test** (此二试也).\n\n**Yǐn Xǐ** said: *\"Now I perceive the Sage’s true form surpasses all—he is the most exalted being in the heavens. Why should he journey to the distant lands of the east? I beg you, do not speak further, and stay a little longer to show mercy.\"*\n\n**Lǎojūn** asked: *\"By what sign do you know this?\"*\n\n**Yǐn Xǐ** replied: *\"Last winter, in the tenth month, the **Tianlǐ Star** (天理星) moved westward over **Yì** (易). Now it has returned from the autumnal **shuò** (朔), and the **fusion wind** (融风) has arrived three times. Moreover, the **purple qi** (紫气) from the southeast appeared like a dragon or serpent and moved westward—this is the proof that the **True Person** (真人) is crossing the pass. I have long studied celestial omens and hidden **patterns of the cosmos** (秘纬). In all my observations, past and present, the omens have never failed to manifest.\n\nYesterday, the signs were thus, so I knew a Sage would pass through the gates. Since then, I have thought of him day and night without respite. Now I see the **Dao’s green light** (道绿), and indeed, I have encountered your divine journey. I pray you may show kindness and instruction, and save those lost in darkness.\"*\n\nSince **Lǎojūn** had passed all three tests, he smiled contentedly and said: *\"I know you have a connection with the Dao, so I came to test you. Now that you know me, I too know you. After repeated exchanges like this, I shall grant your request.\"*\n\n「Thus the Four Sages said: *\"Observing the encounter between Lǎojūn and Yǐn Shēng, could it not be that you have already dimly perceived the Way’s hidden workings?*\nYet those who cling to this humble phrase are merely seeking to teach the world the proper etiquette of receiving instruction.\n\nSo Yǐn Shēng invited Lǎojūn to his dwelling and prepared a seat, performing the rites of a disciple, bowing respectfully before him in service.\n\nLǎojūn asked: *\"Do you wish to propagate the vast and great Dao for the world?\"*\nYǐn Shēng replied: *\"The Great Sage is about to withdraw; I beg you to write a book for me.\"*\nThus, Lǎojūn bestowed the two treatises of *Dao* and *德* (virtue/power).\n\nAccording to *Guǎng Shèng Yì* (The Grand Sage’s Meaning), it was in the twenty-fifth year of King Zhāo of the Zhou dynasty, on the twelfth day of the seventh month, a day marked by *guǐchǒu* (甲子), that Lǎojūn crossed the pass. Why so? Because Yǐn Shēng served as a great officer of King Kāng, and by the time of King Zhāo, he held the post of *Hángǔ Guān* (函谷关令), thus enabling their meeting.\n\nHowever, according to Zàng Xuǎnjìng (臧玄静), in the time of King Yōu, when Lǎojūn departed through the Lǒng Guān (陇关), the year and month of his crossing the *Hángǔ Guān* (函谷关) differed entirely. Moreover, in the first year of King Yōu (庚申), and the eleventh year (庚午), there was no *guǐchǒu* (癸丑) within those years—this is clearly erroneous.\n\nFurthermore, Wén Rúhǎi (文如海) states that it was in the twenty-second year of King Chéng (成王) during *guǐchǒu* (癸丑) that he crossed the pass. This occurred before Yǐn Shēng’s time, meaning Lǎojūn could not have met him—another contradiction.\n\nIt is also said that in the forty-third year of King Píng (平王) during *guǐchǒu* (癸丑), he crossed the pass. Yet this was far after Yǐn Shēng’s era, making the dates entirely inconsistent—all these claims are merely speculative.\n\nNow, examining both ancient and modern accounts, the twenty-fifth year of King Zhāo of the Zhou dynasty, on the twelfth day of the seventh month, marked by *guǐchǒu* (甲子), is the most reliable date, as it aligns perfectly without doubt. The day and month of his crossing have already been established.\n\nAs for the timing of the transmission of the scriptures, according to *Guǎng Shèng Yì* (The Grand Sage’s Meaning), quoting *Gě Xiānwēng Nèi Zhuàn* (葛仙翁内传), in the time of the Yellow Emperor (Huángdì), Lǎojūn was known as *Guǎngchéngzǐ* (广成子), residing in *Kōngtóngshān* (空同山). There, he expounded the two treatises of *Dao* and *德* (virtue/power), along with the five methods of longevity (五茄之法), which were later called the Five Sacred Images (五圣图).\n\nAgain, the *Lǎojūn Nèi Zhuàn* (老君内传) states: In the time of Emperor Shùn (舜), Lǎojūn was called *Yǐn Shòuzǐ* (尹寿子), dwelling in *Héyáng* (河阳). He expounded the *Dao德经* (Dao/Virtue Classic) and taught the Dao of filial piety and fraternal duty without action (孝悌无为之道). The Emperor followed it, withdrawing his own power to let things unfold naturally, honoring the Dao and valuing virtue. Thus, he united the sixteen clans, known as the Eight Primordial (八元) and Eight Auspicious (八凯).\n\nHe banished the Four Evils (四凶), enlightened the Four Eyes (明四目), sharpened the Four Ears (达四聪), outwardly soothed the people, and inwardly cherished the nine clans. All under heaven followed him and transformed.\n\nConfucius said: *\"The one who ruled without action—was it not Shùn?\"*\nThe accounts of all these schools state that it was in the twenty-fifth year of King Zhāo of the Zhou dynasty, on the twelfth day of the seventh month, marked by *guǐchǒu* (甲子), that Lǎojūn crossed the pass. By that same year, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, Yǐn Shēng feigned illness and resigned his office, and on the twenty-eighth day of the same month, he received the two treatises of *Dao* and *德* (virtue/power).\n\nThe *Shǐjì Liè Zhuàn* (史记列传) records: *\"Lǎojūn wrote a book for Yǐn Shēng of over five thousand words.\"*\nAgain, Wáng Zǐnián’s *Shíyí Jì* (拾遗记) states: *\"When Lǎojūn was in the Zhou era, he resided in *Jǐngshìshān* (景室山) and often discussed matters of heaven and earth’s creation with the Five Elders (五老人), composing a book of over ten thousand words. Later, he edited out its redundancies, leaving only five thousand words.\"*\n\nNow, according to *Héshànggōng* (河上公) teaching the Han Emperor Wéndì (文帝) the *Shàngxià* (上下) two treatises of the *Dao德经* (Dao/Virtue Classic) and their annotations, he said to the Emperor: *\"Since I annotated this scripture, it has already been over seventeen hundred years. It has been passed down through three generations, and now to you, the fourth. Do not doubt its authenticity.\"*\n\nThis clearly shows that the scripture was not only spoken to Yǐn Shēng but also not composed in *Jǐngshìshān* (景室山).\n\nAgain, according to *Lièzǐ* (列子) quoting *Huángdì Shū* (黄帝书) in the chapter *Gǔshén Bùsǐ* (谷神不死), in the time of the Yellow Emperor (Huángdì), Lǎojūn was called *Guǎngchéngzǐ* (广成子) and expounded these two treatises of *Dao* and *德* (virtue/power). This is why the Yellow Emperor wrote the book, fully incorporating this chapter as proof.\n\nIn ancient times, the *Chōngtú Zhēnrén* (冲虚真人) expounded the celestial omens to his disciples, and according to what was seen in the Yellow Emperor’s book, it was called *Huángdì Shū* (黄帝书).\n\nSimilarly, there are many references in the *Zhuāng* (庄) and *Liè* (列) texts that cite Lǎodān (老聃) and Confucius as evidence, and later generations, when composing their own works and citing these texts as proof, often do not specify whether it is *Zhuāngzi* (庄子) or *Lièzi* (列子) saying it, nor do they distinguish whether it is Lǎodān (老聃) or Confucius speaking—it is all the same.\n\nAgain, considering the timeline of the scripture’s transmission: If it were indeed during King Zhāo’s time that Lǎojūn first wrote the book for Yǐn Shēng, then by the time of Emperor Wéndì of the Han, it would not have reached even a thousand years. Thus, *Héshànggōng* (河上公) could not have claimed that his annotations had been seventeen hundred years in the making. It was passed down through three generations, and now to you, the fourth.\n\nBy this reasoning, the differing accounts of the years prove that the scripture was first transmitted in the time of the Yellow Emperor, then again in the time of Emperor Shùn, thirdly in Yǐn Shēng’s time, and fourthly in Emperor Wéndì’s time.\n\nHence, it is said that the scripture has been passed down through three generations, and now to you, the fourth. I suspect that the seventeen hundred years should actually be two thousand three hundred years.\n\nWhy is that?」\n\nFrom the time of the Yellow Emperor through the reigns of Zhuanxu, Gaoxin, Tang, and Yu, roughly **385 years** passed. Then, from Shun through the Three Dynasties, the Qin, and until the first year of Emperor Xiaowen of the Han, **2,101 years** were recorded. From the Yellow Emperor down to Emperor Xiaowen of the Han, the total spans **2,386 years**.\n\nI suspect that since **Ge Xian Weng** compiled the *Preface to the Commentary on the Two Daoist Scriptures of Heshang Gong*, the passage of time has been long, and it is likely that the original **2,000 characters** were mistakenly written as **1,000**, while **385 years** was misrecorded as **785 years**—perhaps an error in carving the woodblocks.\n\nMoreover, from the Yellow Emperor to the time of Shun, roughly **385 years** elapsed. Shun lived to **100 years**, ruled for **39 years**, and passed the throne to Yu. From Yu to Jie, **17 generations** of descendants succeeded one another over **432 years**, until he was overthrown by Tang. From Tang to Zhou, **31 generations** followed in **629 years**, until they were destroyed by the Zhou. The Zhou, from King Wu to King Pian, spanned **37 generations** and **867 years**, until they were conquered by the Qin. The Qin, from King Zhao Xiang to the end of Child Ying, endured **45 years**, until they were overthrown by the Han. The Han, from Emperor Gaozu through Empress Lü, Emperor Hui, and down to the first year of Emperor Wendi, lasted **28 years**. Altogether, from the Yellow Emperor to Emperor Xiaowen of the Han, the total reaches **over 2,300 years**—this is now clear.\n\nI also suspect that the term *注* (commentary) should properly be rendered as *着* (composing). Why is that?\n\nThe act of *注* is to annotate and explain meaning, while *着* is to manifest and display meaning—*着* also means \"to compose.\" I believe that in the time of the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun, these were all sacred texts created by the sages to save the world and establish laws, and there was no need for annotations or elucidations. Therefore, it is appropriate to say: *\"Since the Yellow Emperor composed this scripture, over 2,300 years have passed.\"* This implies that from the Yellow Emperor’s revelation of the Dao, through Shun, Yinxu, and Emperor Wendi’s time, it is merely a transmission. Hence, it is said: *\"The scripture has been passed down through three generations, now reaching you, the fourth.\"* Scholars of refinement should ponder this carefully.\n\nThe second reason is to clarify that after the Yellow Emperor transmitted the scripture to Yinxu, they further convened in the market of Qingyang in Shu Prefecture. The text states:\n\n*\"Yinxu knelt and begged, 'May I follow the Old Master westward across the Flowing Sands?' The Old Master replied, 'You have not yet attained the Dao—how can you follow me to distant lands like the Flowing Sands?'*\n\nThe Flowing Sands are a distant realm, where the uncivilized and stubborn are difficult to transform—*犷* (guang) means crude and unrefined. But what method can subdue evil? Only by nurturing the Dao within the body, preserving divine clarity, and practicing purity of mind—ceasing all defilements, halting all thoughts, quieting the heart, and abiding in the One—through a thousand days of strict fasting, refining the form to its essence, can one then seek me in the market of Qingyang in Shu. How else could this be?*\n\nYinxu bowed repeatedly in gratitude. After the Old Master finished transmitting the scripture, he suddenly ascended in a rising mist to the **Taiwei** constellation. The Taiwei is one of the celestial enclosures—*Zimwei* (紫微垣) is the dwelling of the Northern Pole Sovereign, *Tianshi* (天市垣) that of the Southern Pole Sovereign, and *Taiwei* (太微垣) the abode of the Heavenly Sovereign. The *Guangshengyi* (《广圣义》) states: *\"The Old Master, in the stars, is the Heavenly Sovereign.\"* Hence, it is said that he ascended to the Taiwei.\n\nThe *Xishengjing* (《西升经》) says:\n\n*\"After the Old Master finished his teaching, he vanished suddenly. In a moment, his palace radiated a five-colored celestial glow—yellow, green, black, white, and azure. Yinxu emerged from the courtyard, knelt, and said, 'I beg the divine person to appear once more and grant me a single essential principle, so that I may abide in the Origin.' Immediately, he looked upward and saw the Old Master suspended in the air, tens of yards above the ground. His form was that of a golden man, appearing and disappearing indistinctly, with no fixed age—now old, now young. The Old Master said, 'I solemnly admonish you: guard this well. Cease all defilements, halt all thoughts, quiet your heart, and abide in the One. When all defilements are removed and all affairs concluded, this is the essence of my Dao.' After his admonition, he vanished. Yinxu waited until the radiance dispersed and the surroundings fell silent, then ascended to his chamber, fasting and purifying himself. He excluded all servants, recited the scripture for three years, and meditated deeply for a thousand days. His mind became concentrated, his form dissolved, and his bones and flesh merged into one.*\n\n*Concentration of the mind and dissolution of the form, the merging of bones and flesh*—this is what **Liezi’s** teacher, Lao Shang’s friend **Bo Gaozi**, achieved after nine years of learning the art of riding the wind. At that point, whatever his mind focused upon or whatever his mouth spoke of, he no longer knew whether it was beneficial or harmful to himself, nor whether it was beneficial or harmful to others. He no longer recognized his teacher or his friend, as his inner and outer distinctions had vanished. Then, his eyes became like ears, ears like nostrils, nostrils like mouth—all senses indistinguishable. His mind concentrated, his form dissolved, and his bones and flesh merged into one. He did not realize what he leaned upon or what he stepped on, drifting east and west with the wind like a dry leaf or empty shell. He did not know whether the wind carried him or if he carried the wind.\n\n*凝* (ning) means steadfast; *释* (shi) means to abandon; *融* (rong) means harmony. This describes how internally, his spirit was steadfast and concentrated, while externally, his body and its orifices were uniformly harmonized into one.\n\nThe *Liezi* also states: *\"The heart dies, the form dissolves.\"* Hence, it is said: *\"The mind concentrated, the form dissolved, and the bones and flesh merged into one,\"* meaning that Yinxu also attained such profound techniques.\n\nEventually, he exhausted the subtle mysteries of numbers and transformations, and mastered the marvels of altering form through its essence—nothing was beyond his grasp.\n\n*Exhausting the subtle mysteries of numbers and transformations, mastering the marvels of altering form*—this is what the *Chongxu Jing* (《冲虚经》) refers to in the section on King Mu of Zhou: *\"Laochengzi learned the art of illusion from the words of Mr. Yinwen.\"* Mr. Yinwen told Laochengzi:\n\n*\"Exhausting the subtle mysteries of numbers and transformations, mastering the marvels of altering form—this is called transformation, this is called illusion.\"*\n\n「The *Zhu* [注] states: *\"Exhausting the dual principles [二仪] of numbers and transformations, grasping the cycles of yin and yang [阴阳之纪]\"*—this is to manipulate the myriad forms [陶运万形] with ease, as though one had no difficulty. It is also like the **True Person** [真人] who, after receiving the **Dao/Way** of the **Highest Venerable** [太上] from the **Highest Venerable’s** third descent into the mortal realm [第三度降生], could then exhaust the numbers of heaven and earth and all things [穷天地万物之数], comprehend the transformations of yin and yang’s creative power [达阴阳造化之变], and achieve the marvels of dispersing form and scattering shadow [分形散影之卫], of hidden and revealed, of change and fluidity [隐显变通之妙]—nothing was beyond his grasp.\n\nThus, he abandoned his home and forswore his dwelling, ascending in lofty detachment [超然高蹈]. Having visited the **Green Sheep Market** [青羊之肆], he met **Laozi** [老子]. **Laozi** bestowed upon him the title **Mr. Beginning of Culture** [文始先生], and together they wandered to the **City of Flowing Sands** [流沙之城].\n\nThe **Green Sheep Market** [青羊之肆] was where the **Highest Venerable** [太上] descended for the third time—its significance has already been explained in the chapter on **Descent into the Mortal Realm** [降生门].\n\nHaving met the **True Person** [真人] again, he followed the **Cloud Chariot** [云驾] as they ascended the **Paths of the Celestial Ones** [上道诸天], descended to traverse the **Flowing Sands’ Eighty-One Kingdoms** [下历流沙八十一国], and opened the **Dao/Way** at the **Western Extremity** [西极].\n\nThe text notes: *\"During the reign of King Zhao [昭王], he emerged from the Pass [关], guiding the Western barbarians [西胡]. By the time of King You [幽王], he returned to the Central States [中夏].\"* King You was the **thirteenth sovereign of the Zhou Dynasty** [周之第一十三王].\n\nThe *Guang Sheng Yi* [《广圣义》] states that he returned to the Central States during the reign of King Ping [平王], who was the **fourteenth sovereign** [第一十四王].\n\nThus, **Confucius** [孔子] went to Zhou and reverently served **Laozi** [老子], asking him about **ritual** [礼].\n\n**Laozi** said: *\"The person you speak of—his flesh and bones have long since decayed, yet only his words remain with you.\"*\n\nMoreover, *\"The gentleman [君子] rides the wind when his time is right; if his time is not right, he travels with a straw hat and coarse matting [蓬累六水切].\"* [While the original reads \"不得其时则蓬累六水切\", the translation follows the poetic structure from the previous section, interpreting \"蓬累\" as \"straw hat and coarse matting\" and \"六水\" as \"the six rivers\" (a metaphor for humble travel).]\n\n*\"I have heard that a wise merchant hides his wealth as though he were empty, and a gentleman of great **virtue/power** [盛德] appears with humble bearing, as though foolish. Abandon your arrogance and excessive desires, your haughty demeanor and licentious thoughts—these are all of no benefit to you. This is all I have to tell you.\"*\n\nWhen **Confucius** left, he said to his disciples: *\"I know how the crow flies, and how the fish swims, and how the beast runs. The runner can be ensnared in nets, the swimmer caught with lines, the fowl trapped with snares. But the dragon—how can I know it rides the wind and clouds to ascend to heaven, nourished by yin and yang, wandering in the **Supreme Clarity** [太清]? I could not follow it. Today, I saw **Laozi**—he is like the dragon.\"*\n\nThe *Shu* [疏] says: *\"This is the eighth chapter, which clarifies that the **Highest Venerable** [太上] returned to the Central States during the reign of King You of Zhou. Thus, **Confucius** went to Zhou and was able to ask about **ritual**, and he sighed, saying that **Laozi** was like the dragon.\"*\n\nEarlier, **Confucius** told **Nan Rong Jing Shu** [南宫敬叔]: *\"I have heard that **Laozi** [老聃] is vast in ancient knowledge and clear in present understanding, mastering the origins of **ritual** and **music** [礼乐], illuminating the return of **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** [道德之归]. Then he is my teacher. I shall ask him.\"*\n\nThus, **Confucius** went to Zhou and asked **Laozi** [老聘] about **ritual**, and in doing so, spoke to him of **benevolence** and **righteousness** [仁义].\n\n**Laozi** replied: *\"The crow does not blacken by bathing daily, nor does the wild goose whiten by washing itself. The simplicity of black and white is not sufficient to distinguish them, and the observation of fame and shame is not enough to broaden their essence. Fish in a dried-up spring, together on dry land, moistening each other with spittle, nourishing each other with droplets—this is not as good as forgetting each other in the vast rivers and lakes [江湖].\"*\n\n*\"Now, the person you speak of—his flesh and bones have long since decayed. Only his words remain with you.\"*\n\nAs **Confucius** was about to leave Zhou, **Lao Shi** [老耻] said: *\"I have heard that the wealthy give others wealth, and the benevolent give others words. I have borrowed the title of the benevolent, so I ask to give you words in parting.*\n\n*\"In general, those scholars of the present age who are keenly insightful yet close to death [近於死者] are fond of criticizing others. Those who are widely learned and eloquent yet endanger themselves are fond of exposing others’ faults. As a subject, one must not harbor personal ambitions; as a son, one must not resent one’s parents. Moreover, the gentleman rides the wind when his time is right; if his time is not right, he travels with a straw hat and coarse matting [蓬累]. The straw hat and coarse matting [蓬累] are coarse hats and mats [籉笠]. A wise merchant hides his wealth as though he were empty, and a gentleman of great **virtue/power** appears with humble bearing, as though foolish. Abandon your arrogance and excessive desires, your haughty demeanor and licentious thoughts—these are all of no benefit to you. This is all I have to tell you.\"*\n\nWhen **Confucius** returned, he remained silent for three days. His disciples were puzzled and asked him: *\"Master, why do you not speak? What did you learn from **Laozi**?\"*\n\n**Confucius** said: *\"When we were in Lu, if someone’s thoughts were vast as a flying goose [飞鸿], I would shape my thoughts like a bow or crossbow and shoot them down, never failing to hit and surpass them. If someone’s thoughts were leisurely as a wandering deer [游鹿], I would shape my thoughts like a hunting dog and pursue them, never failing to catch and strike them. If someone’s thoughts were deep as a fish in a well, sunk in the ninefold abyss [九重之渊], I would shape my thoughts like a hook or fishing line [钧缴], and cast them in, never failing to retrieve and control them. But when I saw the dragon, I could not comprehend it. The dragon, when gathered, forms a complete body; when dispersed, becomes a pattern of scales. It rides the clouds and qi, nourishes itself in yin and yang, and wanders in the **Supreme Clarity** [太清]. I could not follow it. Today, I saw **Laozi**—he is like the dragon. It left me with my mouth open yet unable to speak, my tongue extended yet unable to retract, my form exhausted and spirit bewildered, yet I did not know where to settle. How could I then instruct **Lao Shi** [老聘]?\"*\n\n*\"That which he [the *Zhu* annotator] briefly mentions, I have elaborated in detail. This concludes the third scroll of the *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power True Classic* [道德真经] *Hidden Chamber* [藏室] *Collected Subtleties* [慕微] *Annotations* [开题] *Commentary on the Sacred Texts* [科文疏]. The fourth scroll of the *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power True Classic* [道德真经] *Hidden Chamber* [藏室] *Collected Subtleties* [纂微] *Annotations* [开题] *Commentary on the Sacred Texts* [科文疏] is now complete.\"*\n\n**Translation:**\n\n---\n\n**太霞老人薛致玄述**\n*The Preface by Master Xie Zhixuan of Taixia*\n\n**题曰：**\nAt a time when the world was in darkness and the **Dao/Way of the Sage-King** [王道] declined, he [the **Supreme Clarity** [太上]] thus re-emerged beyond the pass.\nSome say his name was **Laozi**, others pronounce it **Taishi Dù** [太史儋都甘切].\nSome say he lived to over a hundred and sixty years, others claim over two hundred—his longevity arising from his cultivation of the **Dao/Way** and nourishment of life.\nSome say he received the **Dao/Way** from **Rongcheng**, others that he inquired of **Changzhu**, yet none can confirm whether this is true; all call him the **Hidden Sage** [隐君子].\n\n**疏曰：**\nThis is the **ninth gate**, clarifying that the **Supreme Clarity**, knowing the **Dao/Way of Zhou** [周道] had declined, thus re-emerged beyond the pass, altering his name and title, concealing his traces among the common folk. His lifespan—whether short or long—none could know. Thus, the people of his time named him the **Hidden Sage**.\n\nIn the **Yōu-Lǐ era** [幽、厉之世], the world was in chaos, the **Dao/Way of Zhou** in decay. Therefore, the **Supreme Clarity** changed his name and title to obscure himself—sometimes called **Laozi**, sometimes **Taishi Dù**. One account says **Laozi**, at over seventy years old, still had his mother alive, and to honor her, he wore patterned garments, or feigned childish stumbles and cries to delight her. Such was his filial piety. **Taishi Dù**, during the **Yōu-Lǐ era**, served as a historian—another of the **Supreme Clarity’s** hidden names.\n\nSome say he received the **Dao/Way** from **Rongcheng**.\n*The Liezi* states: *\"Only the Yellow Emperor and Rongchengzi dwelled upon the Kunlun peaks, fasting together for three months.\"* Thus, **Rongcheng** was a figure of the Yellow Emperor’s time.\n\nSome say he inquired of **Changzhu**.\n**Changzhu**—unknown from which dynasty—his source unclear—was simply a sage of his time.\n\nThe **Supreme Clarity**, as the **Ancestor of the Great Dao/Way** and **Source of Ten Thousand Teachings**, is either the **Master of Ten Thousand Heavens** or the **Teacher of Hundred Kings**. How could he require disciples to know the **Dao/Way** for him? It is merely to emphasize that the **Dao/Way** must have its revered teachers, and doctrine its guiding masters. Thus, he assumed the guise of a disciple to illustrate the method of transmission—all metaphorical, as when **Confucius** said: *\"I was not born knowing; I loved antiquity and sought it earnestly.\"* The intent is the same.\n\nSome say he lived to over a hundred and sixty, others to over two hundred—his longevity from cultivating the **Dao/Way** and nourishing life. Seeing the **Dao/Way of Zhou** decline, he re-emerged beyond the pass, now hidden, now manifest, yet none could confirm his deeds. The people of his time thus called him the **Hidden Sage**.\nHence, the *Records of the Grand Historian’s* **Laozi Biography** states: *\"Laozi was sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed, living over two hundred years before entering the western deserts, his end unknown—truly the **Hidden Sage**.\"*\n\nThe term **\"Sage\"** [君] is a noble title for one of **Dao/Way**, while **\"Child\"** [子] is an honorific for one of **virtue/power** [德].\nAnciently, teachers were also called **\"Child.\"**\nThose who teach others, possessing both **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, are called **\"Sages.\"**\nThus, a **\"Sage\"** is one who is both a **Master** and a **Teacher**.\n*The Book of Rites* says: *\"The scholar who can expound broadly is one who can become a teacher. The teacher who can instruct broadly is one who can become a leader. The leader who governs broadly is one who can become a **Sage-King**.\"*\nTo be a **Sage-King** and a **Teacher**, one’s **virtue/power** must be vast and luminous—thus, they are called **\"Sages.\"**\nAnother interpretation: Even among the common folk, if one possesses **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, they are revered as **\"Sages.\"**\nBut if one lacks **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, though elevated in rank, they are despised as **\"petty men\"** [小人].\nThus, **Dao/Way** compares to **Sage-Kingship**, **virtue/power** to **Teachership**—only then is one a **\"Sage.\"**\nHow much more fitting, then, that the **Primordial Emperor, Supreme Clarity Laozi**, as the **Source of Dao/Way and Virtue/Power**, the **Model for Emperors and Kings**, should be called a **\"Sage\"**?\nBecause he descended like a dragon, humble in station, his comings and goings unfathomable, he is called the **Hidden Sage**.\n\n**题曰：**\nThe name of **Laozi’s** son was **Zōng**.\n**Zōng** served **Wei** as a general, earning a fief at **Duàngān**.\n**Zōng’s** son was **Zhù**, **Zhù’s** son was **Gōng**, and **Gōng’s** distant descendant was **Jiǎ**.\n**Jiǎ** served under **Emperor Wen of Han**, and **Jiǎ’s** son was **Xiè**, who held the seal of **King Jiaoxi** as **Grand Tutor**, thus settling his family in **Qi**.\n*\"Print\"* [印] here refers to the name of **King Jiaoxi**.\n\n**疏曰：**\nThis is the **tenth gate**, illustrating how the **Supreme Clarity**, embracing **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, concealed his sagehood among the common folk, his lineage enduring through generations, with unbroken ancestral rites.\n\nThe text is already clear; no further elucidation is needed.\n\n**题曰：**\nWhere there are **Heaven and Earth**, there is **Dao/Way and skill** [道术]. The guardians of the **Dao/Way** have never been absent since time began.\nFrom **Fuxi** onward, through the **Three Dynasties**, eminent **Dao/Way-guardians** have appeared in every age.\nAs for **Laozi**, though born a mortal, he was among the most refined in attaining the **Dao/Way**.\nThe common folk, seeing his longevity and his white hair from birth, thus called him **\"Laozi.\"**\n*\"Lao\"* is an honorific for the aged, *\"zi\"* a general appellation.\n\n**疏曰：**\nThis is the **eleventh gate**, clarifying that the **Supreme Clarity** was a mortal of exceptional **Dao/Way-attainment**, thus bearing the name **\"Laozi.\"**\n\nOriginally, at the dawn of **Heaven and Earth’s** unfolding, human hearts were pure and undivided, the **Dao/Way** unsullied and unscattered. Though the name of **\"Dao/Way and skill\"** had not yet emerged, its essence already permeated the world.\nAfter **Fuxi**, writing and contracts arose, laws and institutions gradually took form, and the **Dao/Way-guardians** thereby gained renown.\nFrom the **Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors** down to the **Three Kings and Five Hegemons**, our **Supreme Clarity** has, in every age, served as their teacher, instructing the rulers of his time, establishing laws and statutes for the benefit of posterity. Thus, those skilled in **Dao/Way and technique** have never been absent, hence the statement: *\"Eminent **Dao/Way-guardians** appear in every age.\"*\n\nOnly our **Supreme Clarity**, though born a mortal, was among the most refined in attaining the **Dao/Way**.\nThe people saw his longevity and his perpetually aged appearance, thus naming him **\"Laozi.\"**\n\n「According to the *Guangsheng Yi* [广圣义], it states: The **Laozi** [老子] was born from the **jewel embryo** [琼胎], nurtured by **Supreme Wisdom** [寄慧] for eighty-one years, and upon his sacred birth, he was born with a snowy-white head. The **Supreme Mother** [圣母] thus bestowed upon him his name to reveal this to the world.\n\nWithin this **Dao/Way-teaching** [道] tradition, there are five distinct interpretations of his name:\n\n1. The **Supreme Clarity** [圣人] descended into the mortal realm, differing from the common folk. The **Supreme Mother** [圣母] named him **\"Lao\"** [老] because he was born aged, and **\"zi\"** [子] because he was newborn. As he was also born with a white head, these two terms were combined, thus he is called **Laozi** [老子].\n\n2. He illuminates the **Dao/Way** [道] in opposition to worldly conventions. **\"Lao\"** [老] signifies longevity, while **\"zi\"** [子] denotes youth. Though mortals age from youth to old age, the **Supreme Clarity** [太上] was aged at birth and later attained youth, thus clarifying his retreat from the world to return to his primordial essence.\n\n3. **\"Lao\"** [老] means \"examine\" or \"test,\" for he scrutinizes all sages. **\"Zi\"** [子] means \"procreate,\" for he gives birth to all things. Thus, the **Old Master** [老君] is the progenitor of all beings and the patriarch of all sages, hence his name as **\"Laozi\"** [老子]—examiner and progenitor.\n\n4. The **Supreme Clarity** [圣人] bestows his name in reverse, from end to beginning. **\"Lao\"** [老] signifies the end, while **\"zi\"** [子] signifies the beginning. Though mortals begin with youth and end with age, the **Old Master** [老君] begins with age and returns to youth, urging all to cultivate the **Dao/Way** [道] by reversing aging and returning to infancy. Hence, he is called **Laozi** [老子].\n\n5. He abandons traces and harmonizes with the world, conforming to its ways. **\"Lao\"** [老] is used because he was born with a white head, hence appearing aged. **\"Zi\"** [子] is a common term for males, akin to how **Confucius** [孔子], **Mencius** [孟子], **Zhuangzi** [庄子], and **Liezi** [列子] are named by their surnames. **Laozi** [老子], **Huguanzi** [鹖冠子], **Baopuzi** [抱朴子], and **Huainanzi** [淮南子] derive their names from their teachings or deeds. The **Preface to the Secrets** [序诀] states: The name **Laozi** [老子] originated from countless **kalpas** [劫] ago, its meaning vast and profound, stretching infinitely into the distant past. This is not because he was aged at birth but because he existed long before countless **kalpas** [劫], hence the name **Lao** [老]. Indeed, he was born from the **Supreme Mother** [圣母], emerging from her left flank, his head already snowy-white, and thus named **Laozi** [老子]. His name **Laozi** [老子] arose from the **Mysterious** [玄], predating heaven and earth, without the bounds of aging or decline, hence **Laozi** [老子]. This is the testimony of the **Preface to the Secrets** [序诀].\n\nExamining these interpretations closely, his name was not conferred due to his aged appearance at birth. Rather, the **Old Master** [老君] taught the **Dao/Way** [道] across countless **kalpas** [劫], manifested his form, and perpetually appeared aged, thus earning the name **Laozi** [老子]. The name **Laozi** [老子] emerged at this time, but the title **Old Master** [老君] predates the countless **kalpas** [劫] before it.\n\nIt is also said: When the **Old Master** [老君] was about to reveal the great teachings and spread the **Dao/Way-transformations** [化] across the world, he declared: *\"The **Dao/Way** [道] cannot lack a revered teacher, and the teachings cannot lack a sovereign master.\"* Thus, he became a disciple of the **Supreme Clarity, Yucun** [太上玉宸大道君], who is the **Divine Lord of Primordial Beginning** [元始天尊]'s student. The **Divine Lord of the **Dao/Way** [道君] is the origin of **Dao/Way** [道] and the source of its penetration, born before countless **kalpas** [劫], as the ancestor of **Dao-essence** [道炁]. Hence, he is called the **Great Divine Lord of the **Dao/Way** [大道君]. The **Divine Lord of Primordial Beginning** [元始天尊] is the sovereign of countless heavens and the ruler of countless worlds, born before the vast **kalpa** [浩劫], as the fundamental root of **Dao-essence** [道炁].\n\nThe **Divine Lord of Primordial Beginning** [元始天尊], the **Supreme Clarity, Yucun** [太上大道君], and the **Old Master** [老君] span both celestial and earthly realms, their transformations boundless. They were born before countless **kalpas** [劫] and endure eternally thereafter, revered by all heavens and followed by all emperors, thus bestowed the true title **Supreme Clarity, Old Master** [太上老君]. The three sages, as teachers, established the hierarchy of those who transmit the teachings.\n\n**\"Tai\"** [太] denotes the utmost extent of greatness. **\"Shang\"** [上] denotes the utmost height. **\"Lao\"** [老] denotes the utmost longevity. **\"Jun\"** [君] denotes the utmost reverence. Thus, the **Supreme Clarity, Old Master** [太上老君] is the most exalted in greatness, height, longevity, and reverence, surpassing the **Five Supreme Clarities** [五太], embodying the full essence of the **Four Extremes** [四极]. Hence, he is called **Supreme Clarity, Old Master** [太上老君]. The title **Old Master** [老君] originates from this.\n\nMoreover, **\"Tai Shang\"** [太上] is explained in the *Guangsheng Yi* [广圣义] as the sovereign title for the **Dao/Way-teaching** [教] and the ultimate attainment of **sainthood** [圣]. It is further elucidated: **\"Tai\"** [太] means \"great,\" with none greater than **\"Tai\"** [太]. **\"Shang\"** [上] means \"high,\" with none higher than **\"Shang\"** [上]. Thus, it signifies the highest rank of one who cultivates **Dao/Way** [道] and attains ultimate fruition.\n\nSimilarly, mortals who practice **Dao/Way** [道] progress from the common to **Dao/Way** [道], from **Dao/Way** [道] to **immortality** [仙], from **immortality** [仙] to **authentic** [真], and from **authentic** [真] to **sage** [圣]. The ultimate rank of **sainthood** [圣] ascends to **Tai Shang** [太上]. **Tai Shang** [太上] possesses all six **perfections** [六通] and ten thousand **virtues/powers** [万德], inheriting the **Dharma-ruler’s** [法王] position and overseeing all sages, thus attaining this sovereign and ultimate title. Just as worldly emperors, succeeding in their lineage, are called **Tai Shang Huangdi** [太上皇], so too is this.\n\nSince the **Divine Lord of Primordial Beginning** [元始天尊], there have been **Tai Shang Da Dao Jun** [太上大道君], **Tai Shang Lao Jun** [太上老君], **Tai Shang Zhangren** [太上丈人], and **Tai Shang Gao Huangdi** [太上高皇帝]. Though they share this sovereign and ultimate title, they do not transmit the teachings.\n\nOnly the **Great Divine Lord of the **Dao/Way** [大道君] and the **Supreme Clarity, Old Master** [太上老君] are the sovereigns of all heavens and the patriarchs of all teachings. Thus, in the **Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries** [三洞四辅], as well as in all scriptures, the title **\"Tai Shang\"** [太上] is prepended to their names, signifying that **\"Tai Shang\"** [太上] is the sovereign title for the **Dao/Way-teaching** [教] and the ultimate attainment of **sainthood** [圣].\n\nThe names **Laozi** [老子], **Old Master** [老君], and **Supreme Clarity** [太上] have been briefly explained above. Yet, the **Supreme Clarity** [太上] conforms to the **Dharma** [法] and manifests his name through the ages, with the number of his **kalpas** [劫] as boundless as the sands of the **Huan River** [洹]. Why so?\n\nAccording to the *Xisheng Jing* [西升经], since the beginning of this world, the changes have been as numerous as the sands of the earth, and the slightest movement brings forth a **kalpa** [劫]. Indeed, the **Old Master** [老君] has endured countless hardships.\n\nThe *Youlong Zhuan* [犹龙传] further states: The **Old Master** [老君] was born in the **void** [空洞], his transformations natural and spontaneous. His wisdom is boundless, his **virtue/power** [圣德] complete. His form cannot be measured, and his names are without end. In heaven, he is the sovereign of all heavens; among sages, he is the ruler of all sages; among **immortals** [仙], he is the total of all **immortals** [仙]; among the **authentic** [真], he is the first of all **authentic** [真]; among the stars, he is the **Celestial Emperor** [天皇大帝]; in teaching, he is the **Supreme Clarity, Old Master** [太上老君]. Sometimes he manifests a thousand two hundred names, sometimes reveals one hundred eighty titles, sometimes as the **Father of Non-Action** [无为父], sometimes as the **Mother of All Things** [万物母]. He cycles with the **Great Dao** [大道], as the root of heaven and earth. His vast and boundless presence cannot be named exhaustively.\n\nThe **Emerald Void** [碧虚] thus states: *\"This discourse on the names of Laozi is a brief account.\"* Now, examining all the scriptures and expanding upon it, we speak of the full details. The **Supreme Virtue/Power** [太上之德]—how vast is it not?\n\nThe text reads: *\"Since one receives the mandate, there are those who inherently possess divine penetration and transcendent insight.\"* Endowed with **qi** [气] unlike common mortals, they should naturally be the sovereigns of the **Dao** [道]. Thus, they can be aided by the **Celestial Deities** [天神], followed by all **immortals** [仙]. Therefore, the methods they propagate to deliver the world—such as the **Nine Elixirs and Eight Stones** [九丹八石], **jade nectar and golden liquid** [玉醴金液], preserving the **True Essence** [真] and guarding the **Original** [元], contemplating the **spirit** [神] and traversing the **inner chambers** [藏], cultivating **qi** [气] and refining the form, dispelling calamities and warding off evils, commanding ghosts and nourishing the nature, abstaining from grains and undergoing transformation, averting rigid constraints and issuing precepts, or enslaving specters and demons—all these are the **Supreme Clarity, Old Master**’s [太上老君] habitual practices for saving the world, not the ultimate of the ultimate.\n\nMoreover, in governing households and states, even extending to the realm, these are but the **Dao**’s [道] earthly shepherds and the **Sages**’ [圣人] secondary affairs. As the **Zhuangzi’s \"Let the King Rule\"** [《庄子让王篇》] states: *\"The **True Dao** [道之真] is used to govern the self; its remnants are applied to the state, and earthly shepherds to rule the world.\"* The remnants are like the coarse threads of silk—first, one must extract the refined strands before the silk is revealed. Silk is the **True Essence** [真], while the remnants are the **coarse** [赢]. The remnants are not yet the **True Essence** [真], how much less so their leavings?\n\nAgain, as in selecting vegetables: the **True Essence** [真] is the vegetable itself. Earthly shepherds are but the **dung and soil** [粪壤], coarse and unrefined things. All the aforementioned methods are expedient teachings tailored to the circumstances for superficial deliverance of the world. Hence, the **Emerald Void** [碧虚] concludes that these are not the ultimate of the ultimate, but rather the **Dao**’s [道] earthly shepherds and the **Sages**’ [圣人] secondary affairs—is this not fitting?\n\nThe ultimate of the ultimate is the **True Dao** [道之真] used to govern the self. The text states: *\"Laozi was tranquil and non-acting, solely devoted to longevity. Thus, though he remained long in the Zhou dynasty without advancing in rank or position, he sought to harmonize with the mundane, internally embodying naturalness. He valued the **Dao**’s [道] subtle and void essence, adapting to transformations through non-action, and so wrote books of profound mystery and unrecognizability, while the **Dao** [道] was achieved, he departed—this is the so-called Broad and Great **True Person** [博大真人].\"*\n\nThe commentary states: This is the **Thirteenth Gate**, which elucidates how the **Supreme Sage** [太上] maintained inner tranquility through **serene simplicity and non-action**, while outwardly harmonizing with the world. This is what is called the **Broad and Great True Person** [博大真人]. The text states: *\"Laozi was serene and non-acting, solely devoted to longevity.\"*\n\nThe *Southern Flower Scripture* [《南华经》] *Chapter on Intentions* [《刻意篇》] says:\n*\"Serene simplicity, stillness, and emptiness—this is the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth, the essence of **Dao** and **virtue** [道德]. Thus, the **Sage** rests in repose, and so attains simplicity. Simplicity leads to serene simplicity. When serene and simple, worries cannot enter, and malevolent **qi** cannot assail. Thus, his **virtue** is complete, and his spirit unharmed—this is the **Way** of longevity.\"*\n\nTherefore, the **Emerald Void** [碧虚] praises the **Supreme Sage** as one who was serene and non-acting, solely devoted to longevity, for this very reason.\n\nNext, it states: *\"Though he remained long in the Zhou dynasty without advancing in rank or position.\"* Indeed, Laozi, from the time of **Wen** and **Wu** through **Cheng** and **Kang**, until the reign of **Zhao Wang**, departed the pass during the **You** and **Li** dynasties, spanning hundreds of years. Yet, he held only the positions of **Historian** [藏史], **Pillar Historian** [柱史], or **Grand Historian** [太史]. Thus, it is said: *\"Though he remained long in the Zhou dynasty without advancing in rank or position.\"*\n\nHe sought to harmonize with the world externally, while internally embodying emptiness and naturalness. When worldly affairs arose, he responded only when compelled, adhering to the **Way** of non-action and aligning with the principles of transformation. Hence, it is said: *\"He adapted through emptiness and non-action.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* *Chapter on Intentions* states:\n*\"Only when moved does one respond; only when pressed does one act; only when unavoidable does one rise.\"*\n\nThe **Supreme Sage’s** **Dao** in retreat, presence, speech, and silence was thus—how could ordinary people comprehend it? Therefore, the **Emerald Void** sighs: *\"His writings were profound and unrecognizable; when the **Dao** was achieved, he departed—this is what is called the **Broad and Great True Person**.\"*\n\nThe scripture says:\n*\"The ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, mysterious, and profound—deeply unrecognizable.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* *Chapter on the Great Master* states:\n*\"The **True Person’s** breathing reaches the soles of his feet, while commoners breathe at their throats. Those with deep desires have shallow **Heavenly Mechanism** [天机]. Thus, the **True Person’s** demeanor is rooted in **Dao**, profound and distant—commoners cannot recognize it.\"*\n\nWhy? *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The **Way** of purity and simplicity is guarded solely by the spirit. Guard it without loss, and it merges with the spirit. When perfectly unified, it aligns with **Heavenly Order** [天伦]. **Heaven** is nature; **Order** is principle. Once merged with the spirit, wisdom flows unimpeded, thus attaining the mysterious and natural.\"*\n\nA folk saying goes:\n*\"Commoners value profit, the virtuous value fame, the worthy value aspiration, and the **Sage** values purity.\"*\n\nThus, *purity* means unmixed, and *simplicity* means untainted spirit. To embody purity and simplicity is to be a **True Person**. Even ordinary people call this the **True Person**—how much more so for **Laozi**, the ancestor of all **Dao**s and the master of all teachings?\n\nTherefore, the **Emerald Void** cites the *Southern Flower Scripture* *Chapter on the World* [《天下篇》]:\n*\"Rooted in depth, governed by restraint—rigidity invites destruction, sharpness invites blunting. Always accommodating to things, never diminishing others—this is the ultimate.\"*\n\n**Guan Yin** and **Lao Dan**—were they not the **Broad and Great True Persons** of antiquity? Is this not fitting?\n\nThe text states: *\"Moreover, Laozi’s descendants performed unceasing sacrifices at **Qi** [杞], ascending to **Yujing** [玉京]. **Zhuangzi**, beating his basin to send off his wife, then entered to serve the **Celestial Sovereign** [帝宸]—both were masters of the **Dao**, causing later generations to believe that longevity was attainable through study, not through supernatural feats alone.\"*\n\nThis is called the **Teaching Beyond the Square** [方外之教], preserving the pure antiquity.\n\nThe commentary states: This is the **Fourteenth Gate**, which clarifies that the **Supreme Sage** and **Zhuangzi**, though they had wives, children, and descendants, were masters of the **Great Dao**. They sought to show the world that the **Way** of longevity could be attained through study, not through supernatural feats alone.\n\nThe text states: *\"Moreover, Laozi’s descendants performed unceasing sacrifices at **Qi**.\"* The scripture says:\n*\"The skilled builder does not cling; the skilled embrace does not abandon. Descendants continue sacrifices unceasingly—this is the text of the original *Chapter Fifty-Four*.\"*\n\nIts meaning has already been elucidated in this chapter.\n\n*\"Ascending to **Yujing**\"*—the *Scripture on Guiding the People* [《度人经》] says:\n*\"The **Yùluóxiāo Terrace**, the **Jade Mountain Upper Capital**, the **Supreme Beyond Supreme**, the **Great Luo Jade Purity**—vast and boundless, like the void, as if nonexistent yet existing. This is the dwelling of the **Upper Saints of the Three Purities** [三清上圣]. Mentioning the **Great Luo Jade Purity** implies the **Upper Purity** and **Supreme Purity** within it are known.\"*\n\nThus, it is said: *\"Ascending to **Yujing**.\"*\n\nNext, it states: *\"**Zhuangzi**, beating his basin to send off his wife, then entered to serve the **Celestial Sovereign**.\"* The *Southern Flower Scripture* *Chapter on Perfect Joy* [《至乐篇》] says:\n*\"When **Zhuangzi’s** wife died, **Huizi** condoled him. **Zhuangzi** sat cross-legged, feet stretched out arrogantly, sawing wood with a song. **Huizi** said: ‘Living with someone, growing old together, and then dying—even without weeping, that is enough. Yet you beat your basin and sing—is this not excessive?’ **Zhuangzi** replied: ‘Not so. At her death, how could I not mourn? But considering her origin—she was never born. Not only was she never born, but she had no form. Not only no form, but no **qi**. She mingled with the indistinct and the indistinct, transforming into **qi**, **qi** transforming into form, form transforming into life. Now she transforms again into death—this is the cycle of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. People lie still in the great hall, taking Heaven and Earth as their dwelling. Yet I, clattering and wailing in pursuit of her, deemed myself unaligned with **Heaven’s Command** [命], so I stopped.’\"*\n\nIt also says: *\"Entering to serve the **Celestial Sovereign**.\"* According to the *New Record of the Dan Platform* [《丹台新录》]:\n*\"**Zhuangzi** ascended as **Grand Master of the Great Mystery** [太玄博士], a position of immortality.\"*\n\n「Thus it is said: \"Entering to serve the Celestial Sovereign.\" It is further inscribed: *\"All are Dao’s Grand Masters.\"*\n\nHe intended to make the world believe that longevity could be cultivated through learning—not through divine or extraordinary means, but through study. This is the teaching of the **outer realm** [方外], which carries the **pure and ancient Daoist wind** [淳古之風].\n\nNow, the teaching of the **inner realm** [方内] discusses the **Dao of human relations** [人倫之道] and the **methods of governance for the world** [治世之法]. The teaching of the **outer realm** [方外] expounds upon the **mysterious and ancient Daoist wind** [玄古之風] and the **methods of transcendence** [出世之法].\n\nWhy so? The *Zhuangzi: Grand Master* [《莊子·大宗師》] states:\n\nThe three friends—**Zi Sanghu** [子桑户], **Mengzi Fan** [孟孫反], and **Zi Qin Zhang** [子琴張]—lived together in harmony, without discord. When **Zi Sanghu** died and had not yet been buried, **Confucius** heard of it and sent **Zigong** [子貢] to attend to the funeral rites. Some plucked strings, others struck the **qin** [琴], and together they sang in harmony:\n\n*\"Alas, here comes Zi Sanghu! Alas, here comes Zi Sanghu!\nYet he has returned to his true nature,\nAnd I still cling to human existence—ah, how fitting!\"*\n\n**Zigong** hurried forward and asked: *\"May I inquire: to stand beside a corpse and sing—is this proper ritual?\"*\n\nThe two men looked at each other and laughed: *\"How could you possibly understand the meaning of ritual?\"*\n\n**Zigong** withdrew and reported to **Confucius**: *\"What kind of men are they? They practice no cultivation, yet they abandon their physical forms. Standing beside the corpse, they sing, their complexions unchanged—there is no way to describe them. What kind of men are they?\"*\n\n**Confucius** replied: *\"They dwell beyond the realm of the world’s conventions. I, however, dwell within the world’s conventions. The outer and inner realms do not intersect, yet I sent you to mourn them—how crude of me!\"*\n\n*\"Those men are already becoming one with the Creator, wandering in the **one qi** of Heaven and Earth. To them, life is but a parasitic growth, a **wart** [附赘] or **canker** [音缀], and death is its removal, like **surgically excising a wart** [决疣] or **draining a boil** [溃瘫]. If they are like this, how could they know the order of death and life?\"*\n\n*\"The teaching of the outer realm is by no means limited to this single example. It is merely a broad outline of its principles.\"*\n\nThus, the *Bìxū Sequence* states:\n\n*\"Though Laozi and Zhuangzi had wives, children, and descendants, they ultimately became the grand masters of the **Dao** and the teachers of humanity and Heaven. This is because they mingled among the common folk while their minds wandered beyond worldly concerns, diligently practicing the **Dao** to its fullest extent. They sought to teach mortals that **long life** is a skill to be cultivated—not a matter of supernatural feats alone. Therefore, it is said that this is the **outer realm’s teaching**, bearing the purity of ancient virtue.\"*\n\n---\n**Moral Canon of the Dao: Commentary on Hidden Mysteries**\n*Volume Four of the *Cangshì Mùwēi* Closed Exegesis*\n*Volume Five of the *Cangshì Zuǎnwēi* Open Exegesis*\n*Compiled by the Elder of Great Dawn, Xue Zhìxuān*\n\n**Title:** Yet, across the dynasties, they were revered without ceasing. In the first year of *Tiānshòu* (695 CE), Emperor Gaozong posthumously conferred upon Laozi the title **Playen Emperor**. In the first year of *Guāngzhù* (684 CE), the Empress Dowager posthumously conferred upon Lady Yin the title **Primordial Empress**, thus making her the **Holy Ancestor of the Tang**.\n\n**Commentary:** This is the fifteenth chapter, which clarifies that the **Playen Emperor’s** boundless virtue endures eternally, and across the dynasties, he was revered without ceasing. Thus, the Tang honored him as the **Holy Ancestor**.\n\n**Title:** Those who were revered without ceasing across the dynasties—from the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Sui, down to the Tang and Song—each generation paid homage, each age venerated him, and the temples were continuously restored. Thus, the *Lóuguān* pavilions in the southern mountains of *Cháng’ān* were the former residence of the **True Person Yin**, where the **Playen One** transmitted the scriptures.\n\nDuring the reign of King Mu of Zhou, the temples were adorned, and those who sought seclusion were summoned. Du Chong and the **True Person Yin’s** younger brother, Yin Guǐ, were appointed to oversee the observatory, and seven Daoist priests were ordained—this has since seen eight periods of flourishing and eight of decline.\n\nThe *Tàiqīng* Office in *Bózhōu* was the place of the **Playen One’s** birth. Across the dynasties, it was honored with inscriptions, including the *Cài Yōng* stele, the *Biàn Shào* stele, and the *Xuē Dàohéng* stele of the Sui. The Tang-era steles are now corrupted and incomplete, and it is unclear who composed them. As Wang Xīyí once wrote:\n\n*\"The twin gates stand in ruins, lost to Tang custom,\nYet the broken steles still bear Han’s refined prose.\"*\n\nIn the Song, there was the *Zhāng Shāngyīng* stele—clear evidence of their perpetual veneration.\n\nIn *Fèngxiàng Fǔ*, *Qíshān*’s southern slope stands the *Qǐshèng* Palace, said to be the residence of **Wénwáng’s** son, **Xièyì**.\n\nIn *Píngyáng Fǔ*, *Fúshān Xiàn*’s *Tiānshèng* Observatory was where, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, the **Playen One** manifested in a green-muzzled white donkey.\n\nThen there is the *Qīngyáng* Palace in *Chéngdū*, the *Yùjú* Observatory in *Qínzhōu*, originally called the *Qǐlíng* Palace, as well as the *Tàixiāo* Palace, the *Wèndào* Palace on *Kōngtóng Shān*, the *Tiānjìng* Palace in *Chéngfǔ Xiàn*, and the *Shàngqīng* Palace on *Běidēng Shān*—manifestations and veneration without end, too numerous to enumerate.\n\nAs for the Tang’s honorific of **Holy Ancestor**, it was in the first year of *Tiānshòu* (695 CE), on the twenty-eighth day of the second month, in the year of the *Bingyín* (1957 in the sexagenary cycle), that the title **Playen Emperor** was posthumously bestowed upon the **Playen One**.\n\nAccording to the *Guāngshèngyì*, the four characters **Playen Emperor** are explained thus:\n\n*\"Playen\" refers to depth, subtlety, and also the **Dao** and Heaven. It speaks of the **Dao**’s supreme, ineffable mystery—its profound and subtle essence, hence the term **Playen**.*\n\n*\"Yuan\" means origin, root, and ancestor. The *Ēryǎ* states: \"Zhào, zǔ, yuán, tái, yāngluò, quán yú, shǐ\" (to begin, to found, to originate). It means the **Playen One** is the root of the **Dao** and the ancestor of all things. Whether in the world or beyond it, all laws stem from him—thus, he is called **Yuan**.*\n\n*\"Huáng\" means great, referring to the **Dao** itself. It is also said, \"The **Dao** is great, hence **Huáng**.\" The *Shàngshū Xù* states: \"The books of the Three Sovereigns are called *Sānfén*, meaning the great **Dao**.\" Thus, it is **Huáng**.*\n\n*\"Dì\" means Heaven. His virtue aligns with Heaven, second only to the **Dao**. It is also said, \"Great virtue is called **Dì**.\" The *Shū Xù* states: \"The books of the Five Emperors are called *Wǔdiǎn*, meaning the constant **Dao**.\" When both **Dao** and virtue are spoken of together, it is called **Huángdì**. It is also said, \"To follow the **Dao** and align with Heaven is to be **Huángdì**.\" Thus, it is the **Playen Emperor**.*\n\nIn the reign of Emperor Xuānzong, the titles **Holy Ancestor** were added, making it **Holy Ancestor Playen Emperor**.\n\nIn ancient times, kings did not dare call themselves emperors, and emperors did not dare call themselves sovereigns—hence the distinction between the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings. When Qin Shǐhuáng unified the world and extinguished the Zhou, he burned the records of past dynasties, rewrote history, and sought to establish a precedent. He took the title of the Three Sovereigns above and the Five Emperors below, combining them into **Huángdì**, declaring himself the first of his kind—thus, **First Emperor**.\n\nTherefore, the Tang, in honoring the **Playen One** as the **Holy Ancestor**, also issued a decree posthumously conferring the title **Holy Ancestor Playen Emperor**. The county of *Gǔyáng* was renamed *Zhēnyuán*, and the local Yin clan was granted a one-year tax exemption to honor their ancestral roots.\n\nIn the first year of *Guāngzhù* (684 CE), the Empress Dowager issued a decree posthumously conferring upon Lady Yin, the **Holy Mother**, the title **Primordial Empress**. To the north of the *Tàiqīng* Palace, one *lǐ* away, a palace was built, named *Dòngxiāo* Palace, with *Xiāntiān* Observatory to the left and *Guānglíng* Palace to the right. The central structure was the *Dòngxiāo* Palace, the **Holy Mother’s** former residence. Her burial mound and a surviving sandal were still present.\n\nIn the reign of Emperor Zhēnzōng of the Song, the **Playen One** was posthumously honored as **Playen Emperor of Supreme Primordial Virtue**.\n\nThe term **Playen** has already been explained. As for **Hùnyuán**, it speaks of the **Playen One** emerging before the chaos of *Hùntūn* and enduring at the dawn of countless *yàjié* (aeons). Thus, he is called **Hùnyuán**.\n\nThe **Playen Emperor of Supreme Primordial Virtue** thus holds the title **\"Supreme Virtue\"**—for the **Playen One** always speaks of achieving success without claiming credit, enduring without dominating, and possessing no virtue that could be named, hence he is called **\"Supreme Virtue.\"**\n\nThe terms *Emperor* and *Playen* have already been explained earlier, thus the full title is **Playen Emperor of Supreme Primordial Virtue**. Moreover, the county of *Zhēn Yuán* was renamed *Wèi Zhēn*, which remains its present name. Hence, it is said that the posthumous honor bestowed upon Laozi as **Playen Emperor of Supreme Primordial Virtue** stems from this.\n\nThe title reads: *\"In ancient times, the Old Master composed two treatises, one called* **Dao** *and the other* **De***. Now it is known as the* **Laozi’s Dao De Jing***, likely because after Master Guan Yin received the teachings, he designated them with this title.\"*\n\nThe commentary states: *\"This is the sixteenth section, clarifying the origin of the term* **Jing** *(Scripture) *after the* **Holy Mother** *received these two treatises.\"*\n\nIndeed, the **Dao De Jing** originally consisted only of the two treatises on **Dao** and **De**, with no mention of *Jing* and no count of eighty-one chapters. The term **Jing** means \"constant\"—that is, the teachings of **Dao** and **De** are eternal principles that must be followed by all ages without alteration. Thus, knowing that the **Holy Mother** later revered these two treatises, they were elevated to the status of **Jing**. The term *Jing* in the title of this work is likewise applied after Master Guan Yin received the teachings.\n\nThis is akin to the Confucian Five Classics—*Yì* (Changes), *Shàngshū* (Book of Documents), *Máo Shī* (Odes), *Chūnqiū* (Spring and Autumn Annals), and *Lǐjì* (Record of Rites)—which initially bore only their original names. Later scholars, in their respect for the teachers and veneration of the texts, elevated them to the status of the Five Classics.\n\nAgain, the four masters—Zhuangzi, Liezi, Wenzi, and Kangcangzi—originally composed works simply titled *Zhuangzi*, *Liezi*, *Wenzi*, and *Kangcangzi*. During the reign of Emperor Xuánzōng of the Tang, who revered the **Playen Way** and honored Daoist teachings, their works were renamed as follows: *Zhuangzi* became the *Nánhuá Zhēnxīng Jing* (South Flower Scripture of True Mystery), *Liezi* became the *Chōngxū Zhìdé Zhēnxīng Jing* (Scripture of True Virtue and Supreme Mystery), *Wenzi* became the *Tōngxuán Zhēnxīng Jing* (Scripture of True Perfection), and *Kāngcāngzi* became the *Dònglíng Zhēnxīng Jing* (Scripture of True Mysterious Essence). This is of the same meaning.\n\nMoreover, our **Playen Old Master** expounds the roots of **Dao** and **De**, serving as the progenitor of all teachings. Later scholars, in their reverence, elevate these works to the status of **Jing**. Is this not entirely appropriate?\n\nMaster Heshang further divided the **Upper** and **Lower Jing** into eighty-one chapters.\n\nThe title states: *\"**Dao** is indeed profound and difficult to speak of. There exists a formless substance, hence it is named* **Dao** *with force. Since it permeates all things, it is called* **Tōng** *(Permeating). Again,* **Dao** *is also* **Dào** *(to tread). As for the* **Dao** *of paths and roads, it is something that people revere and follow in practice. Hence,* **Dao** *is the awe-inspiring aspect of* **De** *(Virtue). Where there is* **Dao**, *there must be* **De**. *And* **De** *is* **Dé** *(to obtain). Obtaining within the heart and without in things, it is something that cannot be lost, hence all things obtain life through it—this is* **De***. Where there is* **De**, *there must be complete* **Dao**. *Since* **Dao** *and* **De** *are mutually dependent yet inseparable, they are called* **Dao De** *together.\"*\n\nThe commentary states: *\"This is the seventeenth section, which elucidates the meaning of* **Dao De** *and its explanations.\"*\n\nThe title further states: *\"**Dao** is indeed profound and difficult to speak of. There exists a formless substance, hence it is named* **Dao** *with force.\"* The profound and mysterious meaning is explained thus: **Dao** has no form, no shadow, no color, no sound. It cannot be distinguished by the divine mouth, being too profound and mysterious to be articulated. Hence, Zhuangzi says: *\"**Dao** is indeed profound and difficult to speak of,\"* which is already detailed in the first chapter of this **Jing**.\n\nAgain, this **Jing** states: *\"**Dao** is the profound mystery of all things.\"* And the *Dù Rén Jing* (Scripture of Transforming People) states: *\"This is called the profound mystery that is difficult to seek.\"* This is also akin to Mencius’ teaching of nurturing the *Hàorán* **Qi** (the expansive and boundless **Qi**), which he calls difficult to speak of. Zhuangzi also says: *\"**Dao** cannot be spoken of; if spoken of, it is not accurate.\"* This is the same meaning.\n\nHence, it is said that **Dao** is indeed profound and difficult to speak of.\n\nAgain, the title states: *\"There exists a formless substance, hence it is named* **Dao** *with force.\"* This is the text from the twenty-fifth chapter of this **Jing**, which has already been explained in this section and will not be repeated.\n\nAgain, the title states: *\"**Dao** is also* **Tōng** *(Permeating), since it permeates all things.\"* Hence, it is called *Tōng* (Permeating).\n\nAgain, it says: *\"**Dao** is also* **Dào** *(to tread).\"* As for the **Dao** of paths and roads, it is something that people revere and follow in practice. Another explanation states: **Dao** is guidance. Guidance means to lead. It refers to guiding the lost to enlightenment and leading the ordinary to the sacred.\n\nThe *Zìrán Jing* (Scripture of Nature) states: *\"This is the guidance of the end back to the origin.\"* The origin is true nature, and the end is false emotions. Hence, **Dao** is the guidance of false emotions back to true nature. Therefore, it is said that **Dao** is guidance.\n\nZhuangzi’s *Gēngsāng Pǔ* (Chapter of Geng Sang Pu) states: *\"**Dao** is the awe-inspiring aspect of* **De** *(Virtue).\"* Awe-inspiring means reverence. It states that what can be revered in **De** is **Dao**.\n\nThe title states: *\"Where there is* **Dao**, *there must be* **De***.\"* **De** is obtaining. Obtaining **Dao** within oneself and applying it to all things, it is something that cannot be lost. All things obtain life through it—this is **De**.\n\nThe general principle is that all things must first rely on **Dao Qi** (the **Qi** of **Dao**) to exist, then nurtured and sustained by **De**. Hence, the **Jing** states: *\"**Dao** gives birth to it;* **De** *nourishes it.\"* This is the case.\n\nAnother explanation states: **De** is completion. It is the means by which all beings are guided to attain the fruit of the boundless **Dao**. Hence, it is called **De**.\n\nThe title states: *\"Where there is* **De**, *there must be complete* **Dao***. Since* **Dao** *and* **De** *are mutually dependent yet inseparable, they are called* **Dao De** *together.\"*\n\n**Dao** is the essence of **De**, and **De** is the manifestation of **Dao**. The essence establishes the foundation, and the manifestation clarifies the essence. This is like the roots and branches of plants and trees, where the roots and branches are the essence, and the flowers and fruits are the manifestation.\n\nThus, it is known that flowers and fruits all arise from the roots and branches. If there were no roots and branches, then how could flowers and fruits emerge?\n\nWithout flowers and fruit, how could the wondrous functions of the roots and branches ever be revealed?\n\nThus, it is known that flowers and fruit, roots and branches—all are but one body of the plant.\n\nThis is like the **Dao** and **De** in their essence and function.\n\nThe roots and branches, with their wondrous functions, are subtle and hidden, yet what people do not follow.\n\nFlowers and fruit are manifest and clear, yet what people see.\n\nYet what is seen and unseen all arise from one body—just as the **Dao** is formless, distant, and unseen by people.\n\n**De** has actions and manifestations, yet what people see.\n\nHowever, the nonexistent and the existent, the hidden and the manifest—all are one body, now made clear.\n\nAccording to the *Guang Sheng Yi* [Extensive Explanation of Sacred Meaning], it states:\n\n**\"Dao De** is one yet possesses two aspects—its meaning is one yet not one, two yet not two. Two yet not two, because of one; one yet not one, because of two. It cannot be said there is a body without body, nor can it be said there is function without function. Rather, it is that which has no body is the body, the body without body; that which has no function is the function, the function without function.\n\nTo seek its essence: beyond emptiness and being, neither yin nor yang, unseen by sight or hearing, untouchable and indistinguishable.\n\nTo seek its function: capable of both expedient and reality, adaptable to left or right, containing the small within the great, the great within the small.\n\nIts essence is boundless, its function inexhaustible—thus, the meaning of **Dao De**’s essence and function is indeed beyond thought and discussion.\n\nOnly when one transcends essence and function, discards both existence and nonexistence, does one reach this truth.\n\nThus, the title states: *\"Where there is* **De**, *there must be complete* **Dao***. Since* **Dao** *and* **De** *are mutually dependent yet inseparable, they are called* **Dao De** *together.\"*\n\nHence, Sima Qian said:\n\n*\"Those who follow the yin-yang school are excessive and cause confusion; those who follow Confucianism are broad but prone to overthinking; those who follow Mohism are harsh and harm nature; those who pursue fame are superficial and lack substance; those who uphold legalism are cruel and unkind. Only the teachings of Laozi are called the Great **Dao**—\n\nClear and empty, taking no action, yet concentrating the spirit,\nMoving in harmony with the formless, suffusing all things.\n\nIts methods adapt to changing times, responding to transformations in all things, fitting every circumstance.\n\nIts principles are concise yet easy to practice, its actions few yet its results great.\nIts practice is simple, its words easy to understand—\nRooted in emptiness and nonexistence, employing natural progression as its function.\n\nWithout fixed form or constant shape, it thus thoroughly understands the nature of all things.\n\nNeither leading nor following things, it thus becomes the sovereign of all things.\n\nTherefore, it precedes the Yellow Old [classics] and follows the Six Classics, uniquely praising Daoism for its purity and reverence.\n\nThus, it is said: The vastness of the Nine Classics does not compare to the brevity of the Two Chapters [of the *Dao De Jing*].\"*\n\nThe title states:\n\n*\"Jing* [Classic] refers to what is constant and what is law—\nSpeaking of principles that are constant and can be emulated, as in the meaning of the Nine Classics being something to emulate.\n\nAgain, *jing* is the honored term for scripture.\nNow, the *Dao Jing* [Classic of the **Dao**] is above, the *De Jing* [Classic of **De**] below—\nThe first line of the upper chapter takes its title from *‘The **Dao** that can be spoken of is not the eternal **Dao**,’*\nThe first line of the lower chapter takes its title from *‘Highest **De** is without **De**, thus it is called **De**.’*\nLater commentators, therefore, follow the text to generate meaning.\n\nSpeaking of **Dao** without **De**, it cannot be revealed.\nSpeaking of **De** without **Dao**, it cannot be clarified.\nThe **Dao** is without action and form, thus it precedes the transformation of things.\n**De** has function and action, thus it follows the generation of things.\nThe **Dao** precedes, hence it is placed above.\n**De** follows, hence it is placed below.\n\nAgain, when the **Dao** declines, **De** arises; when **De** declines, the Five Constants emerge—\nThis makes clear that **Dao De** is the foundation of all practices and the source of the Five Constants.\n\nThus, the *Dao Jing* comes first, the *De Jing* follows.\nThe two volumes together symbolize the generation of the two principles [yin-yang],\nAnd the eighty-one chapters represent the extreme number of the sun.\n\nTherefore, the upper chapter elucidates the **Dao** by emulating Heaven,\nThe lower chapter elucidates **De** by emulating Earth—\nHeaven’s number is odd, hence the upper chapter has thirty-seven sections.\nEarth’s number is even, hence the lower chapter has forty-four sections.\n\nThus, it begins with ancient sages and continues the ancient tradition.\n\nThe commentary states:\n*This is the eighteenth gate, properly clarifying the meaning of the term ‘jing’ and the intent behind the eighty-one chapters of the upper and lower classics.*\n\nWithin this gate, there are two divisions:\nThe first properly clarifies the meaning of the term ‘jing.’\nThe second elucidates the intent behind the eighty-one chapters of the upper and lower classics.\n\nFirst, properly clarifying the meaning of the term ‘jing’:\nThe title states: *\"Jing* refers to what is constant and what is law—\nSpeaking of principles that are constant and can be emulated, as in the meaning of the Nine Classics being something to emulate.\n\nAgain, *jing* is the honored term for scripture.\nAccording to the explanations in the *Guang Sheng Yi*, the term *jing* has four conventional interpretations:\nOne, *‘by’*—meaning the Three Worlds’ Celestial Sovereigns and the ten-directional saints all attain enlightenment and true reality through the teachings of the *jing*.\nTwo, *‘path’*—meaning it opens and communicates principles, guiding sentient beings as a bridge for scholars and a path to true reality.\nThree, *‘law’*—meaning it reveals profound truths and subtle principles, serving as a model for all beings and a standard for all saints.\nFour, *‘constant’*—meaning its profound principles are distant and silent, a timeless standard for all ages and rulers.\n\nPossessing these four meanings, it is collectively called *jing*.\nSometimes, it is formed by condensed *qi* and written in cloud-like script, with characters a *zhang* [ten feet] wide, eight-cornered with drooping rays.\nSometimes, it is inscribed in jade letters or jade plates, with dragon-script and phoenix-bindings, descending at the beginning of a kalpa and returning to Heaven at its end.\nSometimes, it is engraved on jade or gold, written on bamboo, wood, silk, or paper, transmitted and transformed across time, with seals and clerical scripts adapting to the era.\n\nThough their marvels differ, all are sacred and true secrets—\nExcellent remedies for healing ailments, wondrous gates to transcendence.\n\nEven if ages change and metals decay into stone, our *Dao De Jing* [True Classic of **Dao De**] remains in the world, eternally benefiting humans and celestial beings, enduring for countless kalpas as the supreme path for self-cultivation and governance, the standard for attaining fruit and true reality.\n\nThus, it is called *jing*.\"\n\nThe second part elucidates the essence of the **Upper Dao Classic** and **Lower De Classic**, as well as the eighty-one chapters.\n\nIt is titled *The Dao Classic* above and *The De Classic* below—so it is said—originating from ancient sages, yet still following the old traditions. The title is already clear, and no further explanation is needed.\n\nAgain, observing the preface of the Tang Emperor Minghuang, it states: Though the **Classic** is divided into two parts, the **Dao** is first and **De** follows, yet the names of *body* (体 *tǐ*) and *function* (用 *yòng*) may be scattered, but their essence cannot be scattered. The true and solid essence is called *body*—that is, the **Mysterious Body**. The adaptable and responsive function is called *function*—that is, the **Mysterious Function**. Hence, the **Classic** speaks of *same origin, different names*, and *same essence, called Mysterious*. When speaking of their origin, they are divided into two; when speaking of their unity, they merge into one. Thus, it is said: *Names may be scattered, but essence cannot be scattered*.\n\nTherefore, the **Upper Dao Classic** says: *\"This is called Mysterious Virtue\"* (是谓玄德 *shì wèi xuán dé*).\nAgain: *\"The form of boundless virtue\"* (孔德之容 *kǒng dé zhī róng*).\nAgain: *\"Virtue is in accord with the Way\"* (德者同於道 *dé zhě tóng yú dào*).\nAgain: *\"The abiding virtue never departs\"* (常德不离 *cháng dé bù lí*).\nHence, it is said: *The Way relies on virtue*.\n\nThe **Lower De Classic** says: *\"Only after losing the Way do we speak of virtue\"* (失道而后德 *shī dào ér hòu dé*).\nAgain: *\"Reversion is the movement of the Way\"* (反者道之动 *fǎn zhě dào zhī dòng*).\nAgain: *\"The Way generates unity\"* (道生一 *dào shēng yī*).\nAgain: *\"The Great Way is most smooth\"* (大道甚夷 *dà dào shèn yí*).\nHence, it is said: *Virtue originates from the Way*.\n\nThus, the **Classic** presents *body* and *function* in alternating exposition, revealing the core essence without rigidly distinguishing them by their titles.\n\nIt is titled: *This Classic takes **Double Mysterious** as its core, **Nature** as its body, and **Dao De** as its function*. Its essence lies in governing the self and the realm. To govern the realm, one must *do nothing while the people transform themselves*, and *desire nothing while the people return to simplicity*. To govern the self, one must *chill the **Jue** [mouth/joy] and close the **Men** [gates]*, so that the *Spirit of the Grain* (谷神 *gǔ shén*) does not perish, and *private desires are few while cravings are scarce*. These are its core principles, which may be spoken of.\n\nBut the **Mysterious** that is *seen but not seen, heard but not heard*—the **Mysterious** beyond the **Mysterious**, the **Gate of All Marvels**—is perhaps beyond what can be spoken or transmitted. Those who wander its halls and courtyards claim to have ascended the hall and glimpsed its depths, but only when they delve deeply and ponder with precision do they, in the Dao, know its *fine tip of an autumn hair* (秋毫之端 *qiū háo zhī duān*), yet still grasp but a fraction of its whole. The preface says: *This is the nineteenth gate, revealing the core principles of the **Dao** and **De** Classics, the great essence of governing the realm and the self, left for later generations to inherit*. Within this gate, there are two further divisions. The first elucidates the core principles of **Dao De**. The second reveals the great essence of governing the realm and the self.\n\nThe first, which elucidates the core principles of **Dao De**, is titled: *This Classic takes **Double Mysterious** as its core, **Nature** as its body, and **Dao De** as its function*. **Double Mysterious** as the core is evidenced by the **Classic**’s words: *\"All called Mysterious\"* (同谓之玄 *tóng wèi zhī xuán*), *\"the **Mysterious** beyond the **Mysterious**, the **Gate of All Marvels**\"* (玄之又玄，众妙之门 *xuán zhī yòu xuán, zhòng miào zhī mén*). Again: *\"Reduce it again, reduce it again, until reaching **Do-Nothing***\"* (损之又损，以至於无为 *sǔn zhī yòu sǔn, yǐ zhì yú wúwéi*). **Nature** as the *body* is evidenced by the **Classic**’s words: *\"All the people say I am **Nature**\"* (百姓皆谓我自然 *bǎi xiànng jiē wèi wǒ zìrán*). Again: *\"Humans follow Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Way, the Way follows **Nature**\"* (人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然 *rén fǎ dì, dì fǎ tiān, tiān fǎ dào, dào fǎ zìrán*). **Dao De** as the *function* is evidenced by the **Classic**’s words: *\"The Way is **Surging** yet its **Function** is applied\"* (道冲而用之 *dào chōng ér yòng zhī*). Again: *\"Reversion is the movement of the Way\"* (反者道之动 *fǎn zhě dào zhī dòng*), *\"The yielding is the **Way’s** withdrawal\"* (弱者道之甩 *ruò zhě dào zhī shuǎi*). Again: *\"Great fullness seems **Surging**—its **Function** is inexhaustible\"* (大盈若冲，其用不穷 *dà yíng ruò chōng, qí yòng bù qióng). These are its great principles.\n\nThe meanings of each phrase are individually clarified in their respective chapters, and I shall not repeat them here.\n\nThe *Guangsheng Yi* [Comprehensive Sacred Meaning] says: *The core and its tendency are unified*—that is, this **True Classic of Dao De** encompasses all meanings, pointing to their intent and purpose, each with its own masterful principle. Moreover, the scholars such as **He Shang Gong** [Riverbank Master], **Yan Junping** [Sage of Strictness], all expounded on the **Way** of governing the realm. The **Songling Immortal**, **Sun Deng** of the Wei Dynasty, **Tao Yuanming** [Hidden Residence Sage] of the Liang Dynasty, **Gu Huan** of the Southern Qi, all expounded on the **Way** of governing the self. The monks **Luo Shi** in the time of **Fu Jian**, **Futuo Cheng** in the time of the **Hou Zhao**, and **Duo Lue** in the reign of **Liang Wu Emperor**, all expounded on the **Way** of matters, principles, and cause-and-effect. The Daoists **Meng Zhizhou**, **Zang Xuanjing**, **Zhu Lian** of the Chen Dynasty, **Liu Jinxi** of the Sui Dynasty, **Cheng Xuaneng**, **Cai Zihuang**, **Huang Xuan’ao**, **Li Rong**, **Che Xuanbi**, **Zhang Huichao**, and **Li Yuanxing** of the Tang Dynasty, all expounded on the **Way** of **Double Mysterious**. **He Yan**, **Zhong Hui**, **Du Yuankai**, **Wang Fusi**, **Yang Fu**, **Lu Shi**, and **Liu Renhui**, all expounded on the **Way** of **Do-Nothing** and **Void Extremity** for governing the family and the realm.\n\nThese scholars, in their interpretations and expositions, each have their own distinct tendencies. Moreover, each school’s reception of learning and establishment of doctrine also differs. **Yan Junping** took *Mysterious and Void* as his core. **Gu Huan** took *Do-Nothing* as his core. **Meng Zhizhou** and **Zang Xuanjing** took *Dao De* as their core. **Liang Wu Emperor** took *Neither Existence nor Non-Existence* as his core. **Sun Deng** took **Double Mysterious** as his core. Among these doctrines, **Sun Deng’s** is the most profound.\n\nThe **True Person of Azure Emptiness** [Laozi], who compiled these subtle teachings, also took **Double Mysterious** as his core, **Nature** as his *body*, and **Dao De** as his *function*. When practiced in the realm, it leads to *Do-Nothing and no affairs*, naturally attaining **Great Peace**. When practiced in the family, it brings *harmony among the six relations*, and *no calamities intrude*. When practiced in the self, it means *embracing unity and guarding the center*, naturally ascending to the **Way’s** fruition. Those who attain it *soar through the void and tread upon the luminous*, gazing long and living forever. Those who lose it suffer *calamity upon the self and the family*, with *shortened lifespan and hastened death*. It depends on the **Upper Sage** [superior person] who is diligent, guarding and embracing it, always as the standard model.\n\nThe second part, which reveals the great essence of governing the realm and the self—titled *Its essence lies in governing the self and the realm*—concerns the *fine tip of an autumn hair* that is but a fraction of the whole. The above titles are all verified by this **Classic** itself, with their meanings clarified in the respective chapters below. I shall not repeat them here.\n\nFurthermore, according to the *Tang **Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary**’s preface*, it states: *The **Dao** and **De** Classics, their essence lies in governing the self and the realm*. To govern the realm is to *abolish arrogance and discard ornamentation*, practicing *Do-Nothing and saying nothing* as the teaching. To govern the self is to *manifest simplicity and embrace purity*, with *few private desires and scarce cravings*, striving for *a void heart and a substance-filled belly*.\n\nThe essential meaning here may be spoken of thus:\n\nWhen it comes to exhausting principle and fulfilling nature—\nto close off desires and still thoughts,\nto dwell in the true and practice expedient means,\nto sit in forgetfulness and abandon illumination—\nto diminish again and again, to make it ever more profound—\nthese are matters so subtle they can scarcely be spoken of or transmitted.\n\nWhat is meant by exhausting principle and fulfilling nature?\nAccording to the *Guangsheng Yi*:\nExhausting principle means penetrating to the deepest, most subtle truths of all things.\nFulfilling nature means exhausting the inherent nature bestowed upon all beings.\nWhen the principles of things are fully exhausted and the natures of beings are fully realized,\nthen one attains the ultimate in life’s purpose.\n\nClosing off desires and stilling thoughts:\nWhen the mind follows a scene and gives rise to craving, it is called *desire* (*lǜ*).\nWhen the heart clings to thoughts and fixates, it is called *thought* (*xiǎng*).\nWithin this teaching, these are divided into four categories:\nThe first is when the mind follows a virtuous scene and gives rise to virtuous craving—this is called *virtuous desire*.\nThe second is when the mind follows a wicked scene and gives rise to wicked craving—this is called *wicked desire*.\nThe third is when the heart clings to virtuous thoughts—this is called *virtuous thought*.\nThe fourth is when the heart clings to wicked thoughts—this is called *wicked thought*.\nThough all four arise from scenes, they are distinguished as virtuous or wicked.\n\nFor those who first cultivate the Dao,\nafter closing off wicked desires and stilling wicked thoughts,\nthey lower their minds, allowing them to settle—\ntheir thoughts and reflections grow pure and true,\nand they gradually enter the Dao’s path.\nEven virtuous desires and virtuous thoughts are then forgotten.\nOnly then can one exhaust the subtle principles and realize true nature,\nforgetting desires and thoughts alike,\nand thus attain the Dao.\nHence it is said: *Exhaust principle, fulfill nature, close desires, still thoughts.*\n\nTo dwell in the true and practice expedient means:\nAccording to the *Guangsheng Yi*,\nthe *true* refers to the profound, mysterious, and subtle essence—\nthe wondrous source of the Dao,\nthe path of the Great Vehicle.\nThe *expedient* means adapting to circumstances, establishing teachings according to time,\nreferring to the paths of the Middle and Lesser Vehicles,\nused to guide those lost in delusion.\n*Delusion* may also be read as *enlightenment*.\n\nThis is like governing the self and the realm—\nfirst employing expedient teachings,\nthen entering the Great Dao.\nThus it is said: *Dwell in the true, practice expedient means.*\n\nTo sit in forgetfulness and abandon illumination:\nAccording to the *Guangsheng Yi*,\n*Sitting in forgetfulness* is as the *Zhuangzi*’s *Great Master* says:\nAbandoning limbs, discarding perception,\nsevering form and discarding wisdom,\nmerging with the boundless—\nthis is called *sitting in forgetfulness*.\n*Abandoning illumination* refers to the Dao’s profound mystery,\nwhich cannot be articulated in words,\nbut only grasped through the mind’s illumination.\nOnce enlightenment comes through this illumination,\nthe illumination itself is forgotten—\nhence *abandoning illumination*.\nThese are all teachings of the Great Vehicle.\n\nTo diminish again and again, to make it ever more profound—\n\nAll this is the text of the original scripture, to be elucidated chapter by chapter.\n\nThis is the most subtle and wondrous of the Dao,\nhence it is said: *Almost impossible to obtain and speak of, yet passed down.*\n\nThus its teachings are **comprehensive** (*yuan*), its text **concise** (*jue*), its meaning **unobstructed** (*chang*), and its words **profound** (*ni*).\n\nThose who wander in its **corridors** (*lang*) and **vestibules** (*ting*)—\nbelieve they have ascended the hall and glimpsed its mysteries (*ao*).\nYet when they delve deeply and ponder with earnest intent,\nonly then do they understand the Dao—\nknowing its finest tip (*qiuhao zhī duan*), yet grasping but a fraction of its ten-thousandth part.\n\nIts teachings are **comprehensive** (*yuan*)—\nThe *Guangsheng Yi* says:\nThe Way has five teachings, divided into five distinctions.\n1. The first is to **blunt sharpness and resolve entanglements** (*cuo rui jie fen*), harmonizing light with dust—*the initial teaching*.\n2. The second is to **embrace simplicity and preserve purity** (*jian su bao pu*), maintaining a **void heart** (*xu xin*) and **substantial belly** (*shi fu*)—*the gradual teaching*.\n3. The third is to **let the body lag behind while it leads** (*hou qi shen er shen xian*), and **externalize the body while it remains** (*wai qi shen er shen cun*)—*the half-teaching*.\n4. The fourth is to **diminish it again and again** (*sun zhi you sun*), until it reaches **non-action** (*wu wei*), where **non-action** is yet **nothing it does not accomplish** (*wu wei er wu bu wei*)—*the full teaching*.\n5. The fifth is to **remain ever serene** (*dan ran chang cun*), using it without exertion (*bu qin*), for though heaven and earth may have an end, the **Great Dao remains unchanging** (*da dao wu bian*)—*the comprehensive teaching*.\n\nCombined, these form the **teachings** (*jiao*).\nAll five are complete,\nencompassing myriad practices (*wan xing zong bao*).\nHence it is said: *Its teachings are comprehensive*.\n**Comprehensive** (*yuan*) means **penetrating all things** (*tong yi qie*), for the Dao is nowhere absent.\n\nIts meaning is **concise** (*jue*)—\nThe *Guangsheng Yi* says:\n**Concise** (*jue*) is **simplification**.\nNot exceeding two scrolls of text,\nwith over five thousand characters,\nyet encompassing all dharmas (*wan fa bao luo*)—is this not concise?\n\nIts text is **unobstructed** (*chang*)—\nThe *Guangsheng Yi* says:\n**Unobstructed** (*chang*) means **clear and swift** (*tong kuai*).\nThe scripture says: *\"My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice\"*—is this not unobstructed?\n\nIts words are **profound** (*ni*)—\nThe *Guangsheng Yi* says:\n**Profound** (*ni*) means **near** (*jin*).\nThe scripture says: *\"Observe the body with the body, observe the family with the family, and thus observe the world with the world\"*—\nand again: *\"Without stepping outside, know the world; without peering through the window, see the Dao\"*—is this not profound?\n\nThose who wander in its **vestibules** (*lang*) and **ruins** (*fei*)—\nbelieve they have ascended the hall and glimpsed its mysteries (*ao*).\nThe *Guangsheng Yi* says:\n**Corridors** (*lang*) are the **walkways before the hall** (*ting qian*).\n**Ruins** (*fei*) are the **vestibules beneath the hall** (*ting xia*).\n**Mysteries** (*ao*) are the **inner

(*li*) and nature (*xing*), reaching the utmost of profundity.\nYet when they delve deeply and ponder with earnest intent,\nonly then do they realize that in the finest tip (*qiuhao zhī duan*) of the Dao,\nthey have grasped but a fraction of its ten-thousandth part.\n\nThe *Guangsheng Yi* says:\n*\"To immerse oneself in study, to probe and investigate,\nto exert one’s thoughts in seeking the Dao’s mysteries,\nto exhaust the Dao’s sources,\nto annotate and elucidate with the intent of capturing the sage’s meaning—\nthe more one seeks, the less the principle is understood,\nand the deeper the

(*mo*).\nTo say that at the **end of a hair’s tip** (*qiuhao zhī mo*)\none has not yet grasped a single part in ten-thousand—\nthis is the utmost of scarcity.\n\nThus, the **True Person of Azure Void** (*Bìxū Zhēnrén*) opens with this preface,\nalso saying: *Its essence lies in governing the body and the state*.\nYet only when they delve deeply and ponder with earnest intent\ndo they

Five volumes.\nThis work elucidates **Chen Jingyuan’s** *Dao De Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Virtue) – *Hidden Chamber, Refined and Expanded* (*Muwu Pian*) and its preface, *Refined and Expanded Preface* (*Kaiti*).\n\n**Foreword to the Exegesis of the *Dao De Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Virtue) – The Hidden Chamber, Refined and Expanded, with Preface and Verse Commentaries:**\n\nThe **Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue** of **Laozi** have circulated in the world for **1,500 years**. Shining like the sun and moon across the heavens, it requires no praise. Commentaries—both ancient and modern—number over a hundred schools, yet despite their varying depths and breadths, all have contributed in their own way to **illuminating the sacred teachings** of the **Daoist Sage**.\n\nI have observed **Chen Jingyuan’s** (Master Bixu) exegesis, which **weaves together the interpretations of a hundred scholars**, dissects the profound subtleties, and cites evidence with meticulous clarity. His work is **comprehensive from beginning to end**, especially prized in recent times. Yet, **beginners** who open its pages often feel **bewildered**, sighing like those who gaze upon the distant sea.\n\n**Master Taixia Zhenren** possesses **pure virtue and refined essence**, his studies are vast and profound, and he is hailed as the **master of the feathered stream** (orthodox Daoist lineage). For **fifty years**, he has expounded the **Dao De Jing** with **deep insight**, truly ascending to the hall of mysteries. In the midst of his **refined cultivation and contemplation**, he composed **seven volumes of verse exegesis**, **two volumes of *Refined and Expanded Preface*** (*Zuanwei Kaiti*), and **two volumes of *Total Chapter Praise*** (*Zongzhang Jiasong*), meticulously **unraveling and elucidating** tens of thousands of words. His intention was to guide scholars **from the currents to the source**, seeking profundity through breadth, like climbing a ladder to reach the **ninth tier of the celestial platform**. The higher one ascends, the wider the view; thus, upon attaining the **ultimate realm of the Mysterious Dao** (*Chongxian*), comprehending the **great name of the Dao** (*Daodao qiangming*), transcending **form and substance**, and **dismissing both existence and non-existence**, one **naturally finds fulfillment beyond the mundane**, and then—**with reverence**—offers a **single pinch of incense** to **Laozi**, hoping not to betray the **earnest efforts of a lifetime**.\n\nThough the work has long been completed, it was **kept hidden** and not published. **Master Zhang Dasheng** of **Fengxiang** and **Master Bai Xianshang** of **Meiyuan** repeatedly **urged its dissemination**, desiring to **engrave it on woodblocks** for wider circulation. **Master Liu Boying** of **Jingzhao** praised it and brought it to fruition, **entrusting me** to write this foreword. Their **noble intentions** are worthy of admiration, hence my willingness to comply.\n\n**Li Ting’s Foreword from the *Dao De Jing* (True Classic of the Dao and Virtue) – The Hidden Chamber:**\nThe **unity of the Dao** permeates **all things under heaven**. It is **manifest in the Sage’s wisdom** and **expressed in the Sage’s words**.\n\nTo **observe the Sage’s words** without **investigating their origin**, one may be **confused by the myriad phenomena**—**endless, varied, and tangled**—yet unable to **grasp their totality** or **encompass their essence**. The **Dao arises from unity**, disperses into multiplicity; those who **fail to recognize that multiplicity returns to unity** have **not pursued the study of roots and origins**.\n\nThe **source of *Laozi’s* *Dao De Jing*** is **one**. Though it is called the **Upper Classic** (*Shangjing*) and the **Lower Classic** (*Xiajing*), they are **not two**; though it consists of **eighty-one chapters** and **five thousand words**, they are **not two**. Rather, **the unity of the Dao** is **embodied within** the **Upper and Lower Classics**, the **eighty-one chapters**, and the **five thousand words**, so that **all future generations** may **know the one through the one**.\n\nThe **principle of unity** is **vast and boundless**, **difficult to describe or define**. To call it **\"having\"**, it **cannot be spoken of**; to call it **\"not having\"**, it **does not depart from things**. Before **heaven and earth took form** and **all things emerged**, this was **the unity**; yet it **already existed within them**. After **heaven and earth established their positions** and **all things were classified**, this was **the unity**; yet it **was nowhere that it was not present**.\n\n**Heaven and earth**, attaining **the unity**, became **heaven and earth**; **all things**, attaining **the unity**, became **all things**; and the **Sage**, attaining **the unity of heaven and earth and all things**, **enlightened the world**. Later generations **cannot fully grasp it through a single word or theory**. Thus, *Laozi’s* **Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue** were composed.\n\n**Master Bixu** (Chen Jingyuan) **emerged a thousand years later**, **devoted to guarding the unity** with an **empty mind**, and **inherited the profound Daoist tradition**. He **refined and expanded** the preface, and his words **reached the utmost truth**. Yet **Master Taixia Zhenren** believed that **Master Bixu’s** scholarship was **vast and profound**, his **citations broad and deep**, beyond the grasp of **ordinary students of orthodoxy**. Moreover, **after the upheavals of later times**, **scriptures were burned**, leaving **no reference for study**; he feared that **the tradition would fade with time**.\n\nThus, **Master Taixia Zhenren** **rooted his work in Master Bixu’s**, **cross-referenced his lifelong studies**, and **further expounded and elucidated**, composing **this verse exegesis** and **appending the *Total Chapter Praise***, totaling **tens of thousands of words**. He **dissected and organized** them, **interwove and connected** them, **explored every angle**, and **exhaustively detailed** all aspects, thereby completing this **magnum opus**. His **concerns were profound**, so his **words were precise**; his **worries were deep**, so his **explanations were thorough**. **Master Bixu’s** original work **lacked no subtlety**.\n\nAh, this **Classic**—**Laozi** wrote it, **Master Bixu** refined it, and **Master Taixia Zhenren** further **expounded** it. Why has it **endured through countless ages** while **so many interpretations** have been made? It is because **the principle of unity** is **difficult to describe or define**.\n\nYet, **future scholars** must **not fear its height** and **shrink from its difficulty**, nor **dismiss it as equal** and **treat it lightly**. They must **cultivate keen insight and clear discernment**, **progress daily and monthly**, **diligently and tirelessly** **without pause**, **deeply pondering** and **truly embodying** it, then **this unity** will **resonate within their hearts**, and **they will awaken to it without expecting to**.\n\nThus, **one may see** that **those who rise from the ordinary to the sacred**, **transcend the mundane**, **wander freely in the eight extremes**, and **dwell in the celestial gardens** (*Lingyuan*) may **well begin here**. Though its **remaining threads** are **coarse and unrefined**, they are **still sufficient** to **harmonize the family**, **govern the state**, and **pacify the world**.\n\n**Master Bai Xianshang** of **Meiyuan**, **Master Liu Boying** of **Chang’an**, and **Master Zhang Dasheng** of **Fengxiang** **engraved this work on woodblocks** for dissemination, and **Master Jie Shou** of **Pucheng** (Master Jue Gong) **lectured on it publicly**. They **entrusted me** with the **foreword**, and so I **write this brief introduction** to fulfill their request.",

      "translated_text": "The Great Mongol Empire, in the autumn of the year *jǐyǒu* (1299), on the seventh month’s last day, the Imperial Commissioner for the Shaanxi Waterworks, Vice-Marshal Guo Shizhong of Taihua, requested a preface.\n\nMaster Kang Jie said: *\"The Primordial Diagram is the Dao of the Heart. The Heart—ah, the Heart!—is the grand repository of all principles between Heaven and Earth. The sixty-four hexagrams of the Great Ease, their pure, subtle, and profound meanings, all originate from the Heart’s designs. The teachings of the Two Sovereigns and Three Kings, their unity and adherence to the Mean, all stem from the Heart’s law. The disciples of the Mo and Si schools, their unity in loyalty and reciprocity, all derive from the study of the Heart. The profound and mysterious realm of the Spirit Palace—ancient sages delved deeply into its subtleties, probing its mysteries and hidden meanings, thereby transcending the mundane to attain sainthood, awakening to the Dao and verifying the True. Those who seek to fathom the secrets of the Primordial Diagram or penetrate the depths of the *Daode Jing* must, above all, enter through the One Heart.*\n\n*Across countless ages, the transmission of the Heart to the Heart, of the Sage to the Sage, has revealed Laozi’s unspeakable teachings and uncovered the hidden mechanisms of the Primordial. Only the True Person of Great Xia was capable of attaining this.*\n\n*When he refined his eloquence in the gardens of letters and led the Confucian scholars, his prestige was unmatched. Later, as he explored the Dao’s threshold and delved into its mysteries, his teachings became the standard by which the sect was measured. Favored by two dynasties, his fame endured through the ages. Once dwelling in the sacred Hua Mountains, he gathered disciples and friends, gazing down upon the world’s dust, truly embodying the authentic and the practiced for many years. In the winter of *dīngwèi* (1307), Marshal Wang Pingdong, the Conqueror of Cold, extended an invitation with great ceremony. The True Person, though far, graciously accepted, arriving on a crane’s reins and a crane’s steed, making Kangtong his permanent abode—truly the rebirth of Guangchengzi.*\n\n*The mountains and rivers took on a new splendor, the grasses and trees grew brighter, and the air was filled with harmonious qi, while the teachings resonated like a swelling tide. Those who heard the echoes and glimpsed the radiance were not merely the tens of states of Shaanxi. For when even an inch of land is illuminated, the boundless sky is unobstructed; when the Spirit Platform is clarified, still waters mirror the heavens. Like the moon after rain, the breeze after calm, a chest of wine poured freely, the ice wheel and jade mirror—his mind was open and luminous. With the learning of self-attainment through the One Heart, he expounded the effortless essence of the Two Classics, elucidating their themes and citing their texts. The profound meanings became clear, the doctrines were meticulously explained, ancient and modern verified, doubts dispelled—each word a gateway to the mysterious, each character a manifestation of eternal truth. The open are easily enlightened, the enlightened easily attain. Laozi’s original intent shone like the sun, and within the mysterious, there was awakening, beyond doubt. Those who read it were invigorated in body and mind, merging with the text—entitled *Exegesis of the True Dao Classic*.*\n\n*Young scholars, like those emerging from clouds to see the blue sky, ascending Kunlun to find a piece of jade, are fortunate indeed to benefit from this. Is this not magnificent?*\n\n*One day, Marshal Wang gathered the scholars in court and instructed his attendant: ‘The True Person’s *Exegesis of the True Dao Classic* shares the same Heart-law as Laozi himself—truly something unseen by later learners. Among the Dao companions, Master Zhang of Xiqian has already had it engraved on woodblocks. Yet fearing its transmission was not yet widespread, he wished to have it inscribed with lacquered court seals and stored on fine paper, printed and disseminated broadly to expand its reach, serving as the key to unlock the gates for scholars. This is indeed a great kindness.’*\n\n*The attendant replied: ‘The pearl of the Jin and the jade of Zhao—why seek a merchant?’ I, unworthy as I am, how could I comprehend the Sage’s intent? I declined, but my refusal was not accepted.*",

They are vast yet contain nothing they do not embrace, subtle yet encompass nothing they do not permeate.\n\nThus, Sima Qian praised them, saying: *\"The Nine Classics are vast, yet none surpass the brevity of these two chapters.\"*\n\nNow, as I expound upon this Classic, I first clarify the sovereign intent behind its transmission, then reveal the author of this commentary. This Classic is spoken by the Most High Lord Laozi, the *Collected Micro-Commentaries* are composed by the True Person of Azure Void, Chen Jingyuan, and the *Opening Themes* are his own account. Though unworthy, I, the Old Man of Great Dawn, dare to expound upon the thematic outlines and elucidate the *Opening Themes*, hoping scholars may discern the origin and purpose of the Primordial One’s transmission, understand the True Person’s exposition of the Primordial Way, and enter through these thematic outlines.\n\nTo measure the sea with a ladle, to gaze at Heaven through a tube—this is truly the ignorance of measure.\n\nNow, I shall open the themes, dividing them into twenty categories, listed as follows:\n\n1. Clarifying the True Person of Azure Void’s original intent in compiling the *Collected Micro-Commentaries* and *Opening Themes*.\n2. Correctly interpreting the *Opening Themes*, first elucidating the Most High’s surname, given name, and honorific titles, then explaining whether he is the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Heavens or the Teacher of a Hundred Kings, revealing his hidden and manifest traces.\n3. Clarifying the era, month, day, and hour of the Most High’s conception, gestation, and birth.\n4. Clarifying the Most High’s divine appearance after birth, his seventy-two auspicious marks, eighty-one virtues, and the region where he resided.\n5. Clarifying how the Most High, though a hidden sage, lived as an ordinary mortal, serving in lowly ranks to assist the rulers of his time, and his departure from the Zhou dynasty.\n6. Clarifying the biography of the True Person of the Pass and his divination of stars and qi, recognizing the omen of a sage crossing the Pass.\n7. Clarifying the year and month of the Most High’s crossing of the Pass, and his subsequent meeting with the True Person Yin in the market of Qingyang, Shu.\n8. Clarifying how, during the reign of King You of Zhou, the Most High returned to Central China. *The Broad Exegesis of the Sacred* states that he returned during the reign of King Ping, allowing Confucius to inquire about rites and lament that he was like a hidden dragon.\n9. Clarifying how, knowing the Zhou Way was declining, the Most High crossed the Pass again, changed his name and titles, concealed his extraordinary abilities, and lived as a commoner, with his lifespan unknown to all.\n10. Clarifying how the Most High, embracing the Dao and virtue, lived as a hidden sage among mortals, with his lineage enduring through generations, his descendants never ceasing their sacrifices.\n11. Clarifying how the Most High is the spirit of one who attains the Dao, receiving the title Laozi.\n12. Clarifying how the Most High possesses divine powers, acting as the sovereign of the Dao, transmitting teachings to the world through myriad methods to save humanity.\n13. Clarifying how the Most High, through serene inaction and non-doing, preserved this within, and through harmonizing with the mundane, responded externally, thus earning the title *True Person of Great Assistance*.\n14. Clarifying how Laozi and Zhuangzi also had wives and descendants, yet as masters of the Great Dao, they wished later generations to know that the Way of longevity could be attained through diligent cultivation, not through supernatural means alone.\n15. Clarifying how the Most High’s profound benevolence pervades all, his sacred virtue enduring far and wide, with each dynasty venerating him, his temples and statues never vanishing, hence the Tang’s honorific title of *Holy Ancestor*.\n16. Clarifying why later recipients of these two chapters titled them *Classic*.\n17. Correctly elucidating the meaning of *Dao/Way and Virtue*.\n18. Correctly interpreting the Classic’s teachings and the intent behind the eighty-one chapters of the two Classics.\n19. Clarifying the fundamental principles of the two Classics of *Dao/Way and Virtue*, their essence for governing the state and cultivating the self.\n20. Clarifying why the True Person of Azure Void compiled and expounded upon these commentaries, unfolding the meaning of *Dao/Way and Virtue* for the benefit of later scholars.\n\nThe commentary states: This first category clarifies the True Person of Azure Void’s original intent in compiling the *Collected Micro-Commentaries* and *Opening Themes*.\n\nNow, as I expound upon this Classic, I first elucidate the *Opening Themes*. Having interpreted the *Opening Themes*, I must then clarify the author who first composed them.\n\nThese *Collected Micro-Commentaries* and *Opening Themes* are the work of the True Person of Azure Void, Chen Jingyuan, with the given name Jingyuan, courtesy name Taichu, and mystical appellation Azure Void Child. His family hailed from Jianchang.\n\nHis great-grandfather, Zhixun, and grandfather, Lingxin, both gained renown for filial piety in serving their parents, both refusing high office.",

      "translated_text": "In the capital, there were twelve Daoist officials, who, in the reigns of the ancestors, oversaw the official observatories within and without the imperial city, presiding over the rituals of incense-offerings and sacrifices. Those who demonstrated diligence were appointed to public office upon imperial decree. Whenever there were vacancies, they petitioned to be tested on the *Daode Jing*, the *Nanhua Jing* (《南华经》), and the *Lingbao Duren Jing* (《灵宝度人经》), along with the ten doctrines of Daoist practice.\n\nThe Emperor approved their request and ordered the Bureau of Compilations to oversee the examinations. Thereafter, Daoist learning underwent a profound transformation, marking a new beginning from that point.\n\nIn the sixth year of Yuanfong (元丰六年), the affairs of these Daoist observatories were abolished, and he retired into seclusion at Mount Mao (茅山), where he collated and corrected the scriptures of the Three Caverns (三洞经法). Seekers of the Dao from all quarters flocked to him, their numbers swelling.\n\nAfter some time, he donned the simple attire of a scholar-official, carrying a satchel, and traveled to Mount Song and Mount Tai to seek out places for alchemical refining. In the third year of Yuanyou (元佑三年), while passing through the capital, he was invited by the officials of the Middle Taiyi Palace (中太乙宫) and below to oversee its establishment. The Daoist Master had played a pivotal role in its founding, so they urged him to stay, offering him the reverent offerings of *zhīmù* (芝木). Shortly afterward, the court reinstated him to his former position as Right Street Daoist Registrar (右街道录).\n\nThe Right Vice Chancellor, Su Shi (苏轼), said to him: *\"The Venerable Master should transmit his teachings to his disciples; otherwise, the art of refining may not endure for future generations.\"* Among his vast collection of over a thousand volumes—both inner and outer texts—were all those he had personally annotated. He also meticulously copied out three hundred scrolls, mastering the fine cursive script, and his calligraphy closely followed the styles of Ouyang Xun (欧阳询) and Chu Suiliang (褚遂良). His written works included:\n- *Cangshi Zuanwei* (《藏室纂微》), two volumes;\n- *Nanhua Jing Zhangju* (《南华经章句》), seven volumes;\n- *Zongzhang* (《总章》), three volumes;\n- *Chaoyi* (《抄义》), three volumes;\n- *Baozhu Miaoyi* (《宝珠妙义》), three volumes;\n- *Fujie* (《肤解》), one volume;\n- *Yizhen Jianhou Yi* (《翼真检后义》), one volume;\n- *Xugao Shi Zuan* (《续高士篡改为《退身传集》》);\n- Three commentaries on the *Tongxuan Jing* (《通玄经》);\n- Four commentaries on the *Duren Jing* (《度人经》);\n- Exegeses and annotations on the *Xisheng Jing* (《西升经》).\n\nIn his later years, he devoted himself entirely to alchemical practice, purchasing cinnabar from Gengling (绛陵), refining it in his sacred chamber, and distilling the elixir, striving for the ultimate attainment of the Nine Returns and Seven Rebirths. His lifespan neared its limit, yet he remained vigorous. He often consumed mica powder and claimed that in his youth, he had ingested cinnabar, retaining the vigor of youth despite his silvered hair—his complexion and flesh remained as youthful as ever.\n\nIn the fifth month of the first year of Shaosheng (绍圣元年), without any prior illness, he suddenly lost his appetite, drinking only water thereafter. By the thirteenth day of the sixth month, at noon, he requested a bath and new robes, then summoned his disciples to gather before him. He said: *\"Write my death notice: ‘Departed to the Primordial Child’s Palace of the Three Pure Ones.’\"*\n\nAfter they had written it, he had them placed outside the hall of abstinence and ordered his body to be cremated. He then arranged his sitting cushions facing the northwest and, after refining his body and gazing toward the Celestial Gate, softly tapped his teeth, then sat again. He instructed his attendants to prepare a stack of bamboo slips and wrote a farewell inscription to show the disciples, declaring:\n\n*\"Once I was in harmony with the Dao,\nNow I shed this mortal form.\nNeither transformation nor birth—\nI return to my true abode.\"*\n\nAs he finished speaking, his vital essence ascended with a prolonged sigh, and he departed in tranquility. His body was temporarily placed at the Yangsheng Yuan (养生院) outside the Xuanhua Gate (宣化门).\n\nFrom the moment of his physical departure until the time of his spiritual ascension, the height of summer had arrived, yet his form remained serene and lifelike. All who gazed upon him—regardless of age or station—unanimously marveled and sighed in reverence.",

      "translated_text": "The **Title** states: *\"All titles called 'Kāití' are indeed the opening exposition of the *Bìxū*.\"*\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ* bears the surname **Li**, given name **Ēr**, with the courtesy name **Pìn**, or alternatively **Bóyáng**. According to the Daoist scriptures, he **emerged before the void’s formation**, mastering the subtleties of natural transformation, and **dwelled perpetually in the heavens**, serving as the sovereign teacher of the emperors. This pertains to matters beyond the six directions, thus omitted here. Only the broad outline is presented, excluding divergent accounts.\n\nThe **Exposition** states: This is the **second category**, properly elucidating the *Kāití*, first clarifying the *Tàishàng*’s surname, given name, courtesy name, and posthumous title, then revealing his dual roles—as sovereign of the ten thousand heavens and teacher of the hundred kings—manifesting in hidden and revealed forms. Within this category, it is further divided into two sections:\n\nThe **first section** clarifies the *Tàishàng*’s surname, given name, courtesy name, and posthumous title.\nThe **second section** clarifies how the *Tàishàng* serves as sovereign of the ten thousand heavens and teacher of the hundred kings, embodying hidden and revealed traces.\n\nAs for the **first section on the surname, given name, courtesy name, and posthumous title**, the *Title* states: *\"The Lǎozǐ bears the surname Li, given name Ēr, courtesy name Pìn, or alternatively Bóyáng. Some say his posthumous title is Zhí.\"* The name *Lǎozǐ* is the *Tàishàng*’s inner designation, already detailed in the **eleventh category’s exposition**. The surname *Li* and its origin are elaborated in the **third category**. Now, the derivation of his taboo name, courtesy names, and posthumous title shall be sequentially explained.\n\nHis **taboo name** is *Ēr*, his **courtesy name** is *Pìn*, or alternatively *Bóyáng*, or his posthumous title is *Lǎo Pìn*.\nAs for human life, one has a **name**, a **courtesy name**, and a **posthumous title**; upon death, one receives a **posthumous title**. Some posthumous titles are conferred based on virtue, others symbolizing form. The *Lǎozǐ*’s ears were large and drooping—hence the posthumous title *Lǎo Pìn*. The *Lǎozǐ* was born with large ears, and three **leakages** (*sǎn lòu*), their appearance shameful and pendulous, marking the **distinctive mark of a great sage**. Thus, later generations posthumously titled him *Lǎo Pìn*, grounding the *Tàishàng*’s name, courtesy name, and posthumous title.\n\nAs for the **second section on the sovereign of the ten thousand heavens and teacher of the hundred kings**, the *Title* states: *\"According to Daoist scriptures, he emerged before the void’s formation, mastering the subtleties of natural transformation, and dwelled perpetually in the heavens, serving as the sovereign teacher of the emperors.\"* The **Daoist scriptures** refer to works such as the *Xuándū Bǎozàng*, *Sāndòng Sìfǔ*, and *Lóngzhāng Fèngzhuàn*—collectively termed *scriptures*. Within, it is said: *\"The *Tàishàng* emerged before the void’s formation, mastering the subtleties of natural transformation.\"* The term *stubbornly emerging* (*tǐng*) signifies surpassing all things in vitality and prominence. *Space* (*kōng*) means *emptiness*; *void* (*dòng*) means *permeation* and *nothingness*. Before the chaos of *Húntún*, in the silent interplay of *having* and *not-having*, only the boundless void pervaded naturally. According to the *Guǎng Shèngyì*: *\"The *Lǎojūn* originated from the beginningless, arising from no cause, as the first of all *Dao*s and the ancestor of *yuánqì*. At that time, there was no light, no form, no color, no sound, no origin, no thread—dim and obscure, hence called *space-void*.\"* It further states: *\"The *Lǎojūn*’s essence is *emptiness*, his nature *spontaneity*. Nothing could make him thus, nor could anything prevent it; he did not know why it was so, nor why it was not—hence *spontaneity*.\"* It speaks of the *Tàishàng Lǎojūn* having no supreme ancestor, his body being the *Dao* itself—condensing into form, dispersing as *qi*, embodying the subtleties of spontaneity, wielding authority over creation. Before the chaos had yet divided, in the space-void’s uppermost expanse, his *Dao*-body already distinctly emerged, manifesting at that time. The scripture states: *\"I know not whose child I am, preceding the August Sovereign\"*—this is the meaning.\n\nAs for **dwelling perpetually in the heavens**, it refers to his sojourn through the various heavens, serving as the teaching sovereign of the ten thousand heavens. According to the *Yóulóng Zhuàn*: *\"In antiquity, Yín Zhēnzhēn followed the *Lǎojūn* westward into the flowing sands, and upon returning, ascended with the sacred retinue to traverse the three realms and nine heavens, reaching the ten thousand heavens.\"* Each time the *Tàishàng* arrived at a heaven, he saw its imperial sovereigns, golden boys and jade girls, ten thousand chariots and a hundred thousand cavalry, jade banners and feathered canopies, celestial music filling the sky as they came to welcome him. Within that heaven, the *Tàishàng Lǎojūn* toured its palaces, expounding profound *dharma* to its inhabitants, serving as their teaching sovereign. Likewise, in every other heaven he visited, the ceremonies, music, feasts, palaces, and scriptural transmissions followed the same pattern, extending universally across the ten thousand heavens.\n\nAccording to the *Guǎng Shèngyì*: *\"The *Lǎojūn* also ascended to pay homage to *Yuánshǐ*, leveling his voice. He reported on sins and blessings, attended the *Yùchén* audience, recorded the nine palaces, and oversaw the registers of life and death across the three realms. Before him stood countless heavenly kings, seeking guidance on wind, rain, drought, famine, prosperity, adversity, life, death, virtue, and vice.\"* Thus, traversing the ten thousand heavens, he propagated the *Dao*’s transformations, ever-present in the *Tàichì* Palace of the *Tàichìng* Realm within the *Tàixiāng* Heaven. Hence, it is said he **dwelled perpetually in the heavens**.\n\nAs for **serving as the sovereign teacher of the emperors**, the *Guǎng Shèngyì* states: *\"During the era of the Three Sovereigns, humanity remained pure and unadorned.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The heading states: *\"The Mother of Laozi was impregnated by a great falling star and conceived. This was manifested in the Li lineage, born in the Shang dynasty, during the seventeenth year of the eighteenth Shang king, Yangjia, in a year of the cycle marked by Gēngshēn. She carried the embryo for eighty-one years, completing the nine-nine number of the Supreme Sun. His mother often wandered beneath the Li tree when Laozi was born. Laozi was born with white hair and thus could speak. Pointing to the Li tree, he said: 'This is my surname.' It is also said that his father’s surname was Li, with given names Wúguǒ or Língfēi. His mother was from the Yin clan, named Yìshòu. He was born in the ninth year of the twenty-second Shang king, Wǔdīng, on the fifteenth day of the second month at the hour of Mǎo, in a year of the cycle marked by Gēngchén.\"*\n\nThe commentary states: *\"This is the third section, clarifying the evidence of Laozi’s conception, gestation, and birth, including the era, year, month, and time. Within this section, there are two further divisions for elucidation. The first clarifies the dynasty, year, and season of conception and gestation. The second clarifies the origin of his surname and the era, year, month, and time of his birth.\"*\n\nThe first division, which clarifies the dynasty, year, and season of conception and gestation, states: *\"The mother of Laozi was impregnated by a great falling star and conceived, manifesting in the Li lineage.\"* According to the *Guang Sheng Yi* quoting the *Yuanjun Neichuan*, *\"Laozi, in Heaven, is the most honored of all sages. He taught long before the kalpa, maintaining the Dao of non-action as an eternal principle. He transformed into both celestial and human forms, born before countless kalpas, as the sovereign of all sages. Thus, the Yuan Shi Tianzun and Yùchén Dao Jun bestowed upon him the true title of Taishang Laojun, a name held since before the Five Sovereigns across countless kalpas. Though he repeatedly appeared as a teacher to emperors, he had yet to descend into the world and be born. Therefore, in the Nine Purity Realm above, he commanded the Mysterious Jade Maiden to descend into the human realm, becoming the daughter of the Tian Shui Yin clan, marrying Li Lingfei as his wife. Laozi, riding the solar essence and driving a nine-dragon chariot, transformed into a five-colored flowing pearl—or a falling star—and descended into the Mysterious Jade Maiden’s mouth, gestating within her for eighty-one years.\"*\n\nAgain, according to the *Guang Sheng Yi*, *\"The one who gestated in wisdom was Laozi, who, pitying the decay of the age, wished to conceal his sageliness and blend with the common, returning to manifest form to save the world. Thus, in the seventeenth year of the eighteenth Shang king, Yangjia, in a year of Gēngshēn, he took form in the womb of the Mysterious Jade Maiden.\"*\n\nWithin this section, there are five further distinctions:\n1. The Great Dao manifested and took human form, gestating within a mortal, riding the solar essence as a five-colored symbol, thus illustrating the virtue of the Supreme Sun.\n2. Riding the nine-dragon chariot, he condensed and transformed into five-colored mystic yellow, descending into the Mysterious Jade Maiden’s mouth, further illustrating the essence of the nine dragons and the yang vitality.\n3. The gestation period in wisdom differed from the common—eighty-one years, completing the nine-nine number of the Supreme Sun, before birth.\n4. After the Mysterious Jade Maiden conceived, her appearance grew younger, her spirit serene and at ease. For eighty-one years, she was joyous beyond compare—this was the extraordinary mark of the Sage’s descent.\n5. The chamber where the holy mother resided was perpetually harmonious in all seasons, with the six qi balanced—no bitter cold in winter, no oppressive heat in summer. Auspicious light filled the room, sacred winds swept the courtyard, no evil intruded, and all spirits guarded in secret. Thus, eighty-one years passed unnoticed, demonstrating how the great Sage’s conception and gestation differed from that of mortals.\n\nThis is the evidence for the Supreme Sage’s conception, gestation, dynasty, and season.\n\nThus, the heading states: *\"The mother of Laozi was impregnated by a great falling star and conceived, manifesting in the Li lineage.\"*\n\nThe second division, which clarifies the origin of his surname and the era, year, month, and time of his birth, states: *\"His holy mother often wandered beneath the Li tree when Laozi was born. Laozi was born with white hair and thus could speak. Pointing to the Li tree, he said: 'This is my surname.'\"*\n\nWhen the Sage was betrothed in the Shang dynasty, pitying the decay of the age, he wished to descend as a mortal, manifesting his form to save the world. Thus, he temporarily borrowed a womb to gestate and give birth, greatly displaying his divine transformations to benefit the world. According to the *Benji*, his father’s surname was Li, with given names Wúguǒ, Língfēi, or Qiánhuì. His mother was from the Yin clan, named Yìshòu. In the ninth year of the twenty-second Shang king, Wǔdīng, on the fifteenth day of the second month at the hour of Mǎo, the holy mother happened to be wandering beneath the Li tree when she gave birth to Laozi by splitting her left armpit. Laozi was born able to speak, pointing to the Li tree and saying: *\"This is my surname.\"* He then raised his hand, pointing up and down, declaring: *\"Above Heaven, below Heaven, only I am supreme. The sufferings of the world—what joy is there in hearing them? I shall expound the Dao and its laws, universally liberating all sentient beings—animals and plants alike—throughout the ten directions, reaching even the deepest prisons. All who have not yet been liberated shall be liberated.\"*\n\nThen, countless true sages filled the void, all coming to guard and protect him. The holy ones in the sky praised him with ten titles:\n1. Taishang Laojun (The Supreme Venerable Lord)\n2. Yuánshénzhì (The Circular Spirit Sage)\n3. Wúshàngzūn (The Peerless Sovereign)\n4. Dìwángshī (The Emperor’s Teacher)\n5. Dàzhàngfū (The Great Man)\n6. Dàxiānzūn (The Venerable Immortal)\n7. Tiānrénfù (The Father of Heaven and Man)\n8. Wúwéishàngrén (The Supreme One of Non-Action)\n9. Dàcírézhě (The Great Compassionate and Benevolent One)\n10. Zhēnyuànjiàozhǔ (The True Primordial Master of Teaching)\n\nThese are the ten titles by which the holy sages in the void praised him.\n\nSuddenly, the nine dragons spat water to bathe his sacred form, and where the water fell, nine wells formed. Today, in the Taqing Palace of Bozhou, they are called the Nine-Dragon Wells, and they remain to this day. This is also as described in the *Huà Hú Jīng*.\n\nIndeed, the great Sage’s descent into the world was marked by such extraordinary signs.\n\nAs for the origin of Laozi’s surname Li, the accounts vary greatly.",

      "translated_text": "「Now let us examine the *Great Tang Celestial Filings of the Jade Register* which states: The Sage’s ancestors were originally descendants of **Zhuānxū** (顛顼).\nZhuānxū begot **Dàyè** (大業), who begot **Wāyīn Guā** (娲音瓜).\nWāyīn married a daughter of the **Qiáo** (乔) clan, and upon being illuminated by the **Moonlight of Acclaim** (感月光贯昂), gave birth to **Jiùyáo** (咎繇), whose name was pronounced **Gāo** (皋).\nJiùyáo was pronounced **Yáo** (姚), and he begot **Bóyì** (伯翳).\nBóyì begot **Lǐzhēng** (理征), whose descendants became **shìshī** (士师, officials/judges).\nWhen Lǐzhēng fled the chaos of **Jié** (桀), he retreated to the ruins of **Yīhóu** (伊侯) and sustained himself on **lǐ fruit** (李实), thus changing his surname from **Lǐ** (理) to **Lǐ** (李).\nThis account states that Jiùyáo’s descendants took **Lǐ** (理) as their surname due to their merit in administering justice, and later, some descendants became the **Lǐ** (里) clan.\nIt was only when they sought refuge in the ruins of Yīhóu that they changed the surname **Lǐ** (里) to **Lǐ** (李).\nLǐzhēng begot **Lìzhēn** (利贞), who lived in the time of **Yīn Shāng** (殷汤).\nLìzhēn begot **Chāngzǔ** (昌祖), who served as a **great official** (大夫) in the state of **Chén** (陈) and settled in **Kǔ County** (苦县).\nChāngzǔ begot **Míng** (明), who became the **Chancellor** (相) of Chén and was enshrined in a temple north of **Lài Xiāng** (濑乡), giving rise to **Xiàngchéng** (相城).\nMíng begot **Qìngbīn** (庆宾), who begot **Língfēi** (灵飞), also known as **Qiánhuì** (虔会).\nBoth Qìngbīn and Língfēi ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\nThe text earlier mentions that they took the **plum tree** (桃树, *táoshù*) as their surname, hence the surname **Lǐ** (李).\nExamining this, the surname may have been **Lǐ** (理), **Lǐ** (里), or **Lǐ** (李), though their pronunciations were the same, their characters differed.\nThis shifting of surnames according to different eras is not reliable.\nOnly the account of taking the **plum tree** (桃树) as the surname, as attested by **Master Dù Tiānshī** (杜天师), is correct.\n\nAccording to **Xuē Dàohéng** (薛道衡) of the **Sui Dynasty** in his *Laozi Stele* (《老君碑》):\n*\"Illuminated by the sun at his birth, his origins in receiving qi are unfathomable.\nHe took the **plum tree** (桃树) as his surname, yet the source of his **blowing the bamboo flute and establishing the Dao** (吹律之本) remains unclear.\"*\n\nThus, the account of taking the **plum tree** (桃树) as his surname seems most plausible.\n\nNext, let us consider the accounts of his descent and birth era.\nAccording to the *Comprehensive Meanings of the Holy Saints* (《广圣义》):\nThe Sage Laozi is the **originator of the Dao** (至道之祖), the **founder of primordial transformation** (元化之宗).\nHe existed before the **uppermost antiquity** (上古) yet was not its earliest, and after the **final age** (末代) yet was not its latest.\nHow much more so before countless **kalpas** (劫)!\nHe already propagated the Dao and its teachings, so how could one say he was born from a womb and thus claim it as his birth?\nWhen we speak of his descent, it is to manifest his presence in the human world and demonstrate that he had a beginning.\nHis birth form was the **Holy Mother** (圣母), showing that he had a birth.\nThe Holy Mother served the **Primordial Lord** (元君), indicating his exalted status.\nNow, examining the various scriptures, his descent and birth are recorded in three instances.\n\nThe first descent and birth:\nIn the **seventh year of the reign of Shānhé** (上和七年), during the **year of Gēngyín** (庚寅) in the ninth month on the **third day of Jiǎzǐ** (甲子),\nhe was born between the **Lǐ Valley** (李谷) and **Huánguǎn Língjìng Mountain** (玄罡灵镜山) in the **Northern Mystic Realm** (北玄女国).\nThe Holy Mother was called **Mother of Mystic Void** (玄虚之母).\nAt the time of his birth, three suns emerged from the east, and nine dragons spat water to bathe his form.\nHe thus took his name from the Lǐ Valley, being called **Huángyuán** (玄元), with the **character name Zǐguāng** (子光).\nHe was the **highest of the exalted** (高上之冑), the **offspring of the Jade Sovereign** (玉皇之胤),\nand held the title **Lord of Supreme Longevity, Great Master of Peace, True One of Grand Unity, and the Golden Gate Sage Emperor** (长生大主太平正真太一君金阙后圣九玄帝君).\n\nUpon careful examination, this was also before the kalpa, with **Zhūlíng Shānhé** (朱灵上和) as the reign title of the previous kalpa.\n\nThe second descent and birth:\nIn the **ninth year of the twenty-second sovereign of Yīn** (殷之二十二王武丁九年), during the **year of Gēngchén** (庚辰) in the second month on the **fifteenth day at the hour of Mǎo** (卯时),\nhe was born.\nThe Holy Mother was called **Mystic Marvelous Jade Maiden** (玄妙玉女), who was the **Teacher of the Supreme Deity** (上帝之师),\nlater ascending to the title **Primordial Lord of Grand Unity** (太一元君).\nThis account, upon careful review, corresponds to the era of his descent in **Bózhōu** (亳州).\nIt is the same as the **Taqing Palace** (太清宫) in present-day **Wèizhēn County** (卫真县), marking the site of his descent and birth.\n\nAccording to **Huángfǔ Shì'ān** (皇甫士安)'s *Long Chronicle* (长历), the **year of Jiǎzǐ** (甲子) is confirmed.\n**Master Gé Xiānshī** (葛仙公) stated that the **Grand Age** (太岁) was **Dīngmǎo** (丁卯),\nindicating the era of the **Chou Dynasty** (周师).\nThis was the **first year of King Zhòu** (纣元年, **Dīngwèi** 丁未) to the **twenty-first year of King Zhòu** (纣二十一年, **Dīngmǎo** 丁卯).\nLaozi resided on the **south-facing slope of Qíshān Mountain** (岐山之阳) as the **Teacher of King Xī of Chou** (周西伯之师),\nand was known as **Zǐ of Xiānyì** (燮邑子).\nFrom the ninth year of Yīn Wǔdīng (殷武丁九年, **Gēngchén** 庚辰) to the twenty-first year of King Zhòu (纣二十一年, **Dīngmǎo** 丁卯),\nspanning **one hundred and eighty years**.\nHe then ascended to heaven in the **twenty-fifth year of King Zhāo** (昭王二十五年, **Guǐchǒu** 癸丑) in the fourth month on the **twenty-eighth day**,\nafter which, in the **year of Yǐmǎo** (乙卯), he manifested a **divine incarnation** (分身降) near the **western bank of Jǐnjiāng River** (锦江之滨) in **Xīshǔ** (西蜀),\ntaking residence in the home of a **great official** (大官).\nIn the **twenty-ninth year of King Zhāo** (昭王二十九年, **Dīngsì** 丁巳),\n**Yín Xǐ** (尹喜) arrived in Shǔ.\nOriginally, there was no **green sheep market** (青羊肆),\nbut when the **Primordial Sage** (太上) was in the **Tàiwéi constellation** (太微), he first exerted his influence over the **Green Boy** (青童) of the **Green Emperor** (青帝),\ndescending to the capital of Shǔ and transforming into a **green sheep** (青羊).\nYín Xǐ saw a man leading it, and suddenly realized:\n*\"Since there is a green sheep, and it is being led to its market, this must be the Primordial Sage’s arrangement.\"*\nHe then asked the man leading the sheep:\n*\"To which family does this sheep belong?\"*\nThe man replied:\n*\"My wife, though she has reached old age, gave birth to a child whose crying never ceases.\nShe cast him into water and fire, yet neither could harm him.\nA **Daoist practitioner** (道者) said:\n'If you let the green sheep nurse him, his crying will stop.'\"*\n\nThe third descent and birth:\nAccording to the *Yóulóng Transmission* (《犹龙传》) quoting the *Húnyuán Original Records* (《混元本纪》):\nThe **Primordial Sage** (太上) ascended to heaven in the **year of Jiǎyín** (甲寅) of King Zhāo of Chou (周昭王).\nThis was the **twenty-sixth year** (二十六年) of King Zhāo, yet the month and day of his ascension were not recorded.\nLater, in the **commentary by Zāng Qú** (张渠) on the *Northern Dipper Scripture* (《北斗经》) seen in **Xīshǔ** (西蜀),\nit states:\n*\"The Primordial Sage ascended to heaven in the twenty-sixth year of King Zhāo of Chou (周昭王二十六年, **Jiǎyín** 甲寅), on the fourth month’s twenty-eighth day.\nIn the year of **Yǐmǎo** (乙卯), he manifested a divine incarnation near the western bank of Jǐnjiāng River (锦江之滨) in Xīshǔ,\ntaking residence in the home of a great official.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The **Primordial Sage** then said, *\"I dwell in the **Tàiwēi** [Great Pivot], my true form is **Zhēnyī** [True Unity], **Tàihé** [Great Harmony] descends in purity, and my radiant spirit manifests as a human.

May I ask if Your Benevolent Majesty has come forth or remains within, and if You dwell in peace?\"*\n\nThe **Primordial Sage** smiled and replied, *\"Since we parted, what have you gained or lost? You have preserved the **Dao/Way** and guarded the **One**—how could this not be beneficial?\"*\n\n**Yǐn Xǐ** said, *\"I have reverently served the **secret essentials**, and through them, I have attained their mysteries. Your saving grace surpasses even that of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nThe **Primordial Sage** declared, *\"I once left you to dwell in this world. After a thousand days of pure fasting, I awaited you here. Now you have preserved your form and refined your **qi**, already reaching the **Míngmiào** [Dark Mysteries], and your heart is bound by the **zǐluò** [purple snares], while your face bears the **yuánmíng** [circular clarity]. Your golden name is inscribed in the **true diagram**, and your jade **zhá** [tablet] is tied to the **purple chamber**. Your **qi** harmonizes with **Tàiwēi**, and your form dissolves into **Zhēnyī**—thus you are now qualified to serve.\"*\n\nUpon finishing his words, the **sacred beings of the Three Realms** (三界圣真) arrived with ten thousand chariots and a hundred thousand horsemen floating through the air. They then bestowed upon **Yǐn Xǐ**:\n- the **zǐfúróng** [purple lotus-crown],\n- the **fēiqīngyǔ** [flying green-feathered skirt],\n- the **dānzhǔlǜshǒu** [crimson gaze and verdant sleeves],\n- the **jiāodài nícháng** [crossed sash of rainbow clouds],\n- the **luówén huángguǎ** [embroidered robe with yellow belt],\nand appointed him as **Wénshǐ** [Origin of Scriptures] **Master**, granting him the title of **Wúshàng Zhēnrén** [Supreme True Person]. From that time onward, he was permitted to attend the **Lóngchē** [Dragon Chariot], freely traversing the heavens above and the earth below.\n\nThe **Primordial Sage** then ascended his seat and expounded the *Yuányáng Scripture* (《元阳经》) to the mother, who resided in the southwest of **Chéngdū** by several hundred paces. In the **second year of Zhōnghé** (中和二年), he received the **Língchuán** [Divine Transmission] edict and established the **Qīngyáng Temple** (青羊宫).\n\nThis was indeed the **third descent and birth** in accordance with the decree.\n\nNow, the passage cited in this section refers to the **second descent and birth** in **Bózhōu** [Bozhou].\n\nThe text states:\n*\"The **Primordial Sage**’s stature was eight *chǐ* and eight *cùn* tall, with a yellow complexion. His holy visage was golden, hence ‘yellow’ is mentioned. His forehead was broad (广颡), and his ears were large and drooping (聃耳). His eyes were vast, seeing all (大目). His teeth were wide and well-spaced (疏齿). His mouth was square (方口), not meaning its shape was four-sided, but that he spoke of **Dao/Way** and righteousness (道义) with precision. Even **Confucius** was called ‘river-eyed and sea-mouthed’ (河目海口), both being marks of the sage’s extraordinary features. His lips were thick (厚唇), and his brow bore the **sānyùdálǐ** [three-five enlightened patterns]—‘lǐ’ meaning ‘text’ or ‘mark.’ His brow seemed to bear the characters ‘three-five’ (三五), a luminous script. His forehead also resembled the **rìjiǎo yuèxuán** [sun-horn and moon-eyebrow], as if the sun and moon were inscribed there—near or far, deep or shallow, they illuminated all without being physically present. His face was full and round like a moon. His nose had a double ridge (鼻有双骨), indicating three nasal openings (三窍). His ears also had three openings (耳有三漏). His feet bore the **èrwǔ** [two-noon] marks (足蹈二午), and his hands held the **shíwén** [ten-characters] (手握十文). This means each hand had ten characters’ worth of markings, much like **Great Yù** (大禹), whose left hand bore the character ‘water’ (水), and right hand bore ‘platform’ (台), combining to form ‘governance’ (治). These are the extraordinary features of the sage. His **qi** was supremely pure, and his received form was most unusual. Indeed, from ancient times, sages have all possessed extraordinary features—how much more so for the **Primordial Sage**, who embodies the **greatest virtue/power** (大圣之德), with seventy-two **ruìxiàng** [auspicious marks] and eighty-one **zhǒnghǎo** [distinct virtues]? His celestial visage was dignified, and his holy features were uniquely refined; though I cannot enumerate them all, they certainly exceed these few examples.\"*\n\nThe second part clarifies the **Primordial Sage**’s birthplace:\n*\"The **Primordial Sage** was born in **Chǔguó** [State of Chu], **Kǔ County** (苦县), **Làiyáng Township** (濑阳乡), **Qǔrén Village** (曲仁里), beside the **Wō Water** (涡水). According to the *Tàidīng Yùjié* (大唐天渍玉牒) of the **Táng Dynasty** (大唐), the sage’s ancestor, **Chāngzǔ** (昌祖), served as a great official under the **Chén Dynasty** (陈) and settled in **Kǔ County**. **Chāngzǔ**’s son, **Míng** (明), became the **Chén Dynasty**’s chancellor and was buried north of **Làiyáng Township**—a temple was then established there. Today’s reference to **Chǔguó** may suggest **Yǐngzhōu** (郢州), which was ancient **Chu**. **Kǔ County** was its subordinate jurisdiction.\n\nAdditionally, in **Bózhōu** (亳州), **Chéngfǔ County** (城父县) to the east by thirty *lǐ*, there is the **Tiānjìng Temple** (天静官), where the **sage-mother** conceived. A **flowing star** (流星) is said to have appeared at the **original daytime chamber** (原昼寝堂) there. **Chéngfǔ County** was also part of ancient **Chu**.\n\nExamine closely: the **Primordial Sage** conceived in the **Tiānjìng Temple** of **Chéngfǔ**, descended in the **Tàiqīng Temple** (太清宫) of **Kǔ County**. **Kǔ County** was the ancient name of the region. During the **Hàn** and **Wèi** eras, it became **Gǔyáng County** (谷阳县). By the **first year of Qiánfēng** (乾封元年) in the **Táng Dynasty**, it was renamed **Zhēnyuán County** (真源县). In the **second year of Zhōnghé** (中和二年), it was elevated to **Chì County** (赤县). During the reign of **Emperor Zhēnzōng of Sòng** (宋真宗朝), it was changed to **Wèizhēn County** (卫真县), which is today’s **Wèizhēn County** (卫真县), **Làiyáng Township** (濑阳乡), **Gǔyáng Town** (谷阳镇).

When **Wénwáng** heard of him, he summoned **Lǎozǐ** to serve as **Guardian of the Archives**. He composed the *Chìjīng* (赤精经) and taught the **Dao/Way of benevolence and trustworthiness**. **Wénwáng** put it into practice, honoring the worthy and cherishing righteousness, and the **phoenix gathered at Qíshān**. As the *Lǐjì* states: *\"When **Zhōu** rose, the phoenix sang on the mountains. The phoenix bathed in the streams.\"* It cried at **Qíyáng**, and thus **Qíshān** became the name of the county, and **Fèngxiáng** the name of the prefecture.\n\nEighteen *lǐ* north of **Fèngxiáng City** lies the **Primordial Sage’s** former residence, where the **Táng Dynasty** later built the **Qǐshèng Gōng** (启圣宫).\n\nAfter the **Wǔ King** conquered **Yīn**, **Lǎozǐ** was titled **Yùchéng Zǐ** (育成子) and composed the *Xuánjī Jīng* (璇玑经).

In **Kāngwáng’s** time, he was known as **Guōshū Zǐ** (郭叔子). **Lǎozǐ** remained as **Pillar-Beneath Historian**.

      "translated_text": "**The Primordial Sage** sought to test him, so he commanded **Xú Jiǎ** to tend the green ox in the wild. With auspicious herbs, he transformed himself into a maiden of surpassing beauty and grace.\n\nWhen Jiǎ reached the place where he tended the ox, he jestingly spoke to her. Jiǎ was bewildered by her words. Since **The Primordial Sage** had departed westward to the **Western Sea** and would not return, Jiǎ broke their agreement. He falsified his words and went to the **Guān Lìng** (关令), presenting a writ to demand payment for his service.\n\n**The Primordial Sage** said to him: *\"You have followed me for over two hundred years, and I should repay you seven hundred twenty million coins. Moreover, your lifespan had already expired long ago—I used the **Tàixuān** (太玄) talisman to grant you renewed life. Why do you not remember this? Return the talisman to me, and I will repay you in gold.\"*\n\nAs he finished speaking, the talisman flew from his mouth and landed before **The Primordial Sage**, its inscriptions as fresh as ever. Jiǎ had once more turned into a withered skeleton. The **Guān Lìng** pitied Jiǎ for defying his true intent and dying again, and wished to witness **The Primordial Sage**’s method of reviving the dead. He knelt and humbly pleaded before him:\n\n*\"Though Jiǎ’s wages were paid gladly in advance, I beg **The Great Sage** to have mercy and pardon his transgressions, granting him another life. That would be most fortunate.\"*\n\n**The Primordial Sage** accepted his words and once again cast the talisman into Jiǎ’s skeletal remains, restoring him as before.\n\n**The Primordial Sage** then said: *\"I do not blame you. You abandoned our original agreement, and the Dao/Way left you. Thus, you died. Now I repay your wages and would send you away.\"*\n\nJiǎ fell to the ground, striking his cheeks and saying: *\"I have already received **The Sage’s** boundless grace, and though my faults were forgiven, this withered form has now seen the light again. The memory is etched into my bones—I beg to follow **The Sage’s** celestial carriage!\"*\n\n**The Primordial Sage** ultimately did not grant permission, yet Jiǎ still followed him. This marks the year of **The Primordial Sage**’s departure from **Zhōu**, the reason being that **Xú Jiǎ** served as his charioteer.\n\n**Titled:** *\"Guān Lìng Yín Xǐ\"* (关令尹喜), a **Great Official** of **Zhōu**.\n\nSurname **Yín**, given name **Xǐ**, with the courtesy name **Gōngyáng** (公阳). He authored nine volumes, expounding on **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**. His inner studies encompassed the **xīngxiàng** (星象) and **fúwéi** (服精华), meaning the essence of the sun and moon. He was known for his benevolence and hidden **virtue/power**, though common folk knew little of him.\n\nIt was also said: *\"Xǐ’s mother never slept by day. In a dream, she saw celestial light descend like lightning, enveloping her body, and only then did she conceive Xǐ.\"* When Xǐ was born, he had twin radiant lights like the sun hovering beside him. His eyes gleamed with solar brilliance, and his form was tall and beautiful. He was deeply versed in the classics and skilled in **astronomy** and **mystical omens**. Whether gazing upward or downward, he penetrated all mysteries—even the shifts of **ghosts and gods** could not conceal their true nature from him. Yet he possessed a vast and magnanimous spirit, did not observe conventional etiquette, and was generous in love, humble in nature, and compassionate. He often sacrificed his own comfort to aid others. When inside, he was a guest and friend of the **Eastern Palace** (东宫); when outside, he served as **Guān Lìng** of **Hángǔ Gǔ**. Ever gazing at the heavens, he harbored thoughts of ascending to the **emptiness**.\n\nBefore **Lǎozi** arrived at the pass, Xǐ ascended the tower and looked in all four directions. He saw a **purple qi** (紫气) drifting eastward and moving westward, knowing that a **True Person** (真人) would soon pass through the capital. He then ordered his guards to be vigilant, swept the path, and burned incense, awaiting the omen.\n\n**Commentary:** *\"This is the sixth section, which reveals **Yín Xǐ’s** true origins and how he discerned the **qi** and stars, knowing the **Great Sage** would cross the pass. The deeds of the **True Person** and the omens of **The Primordial Sage**’s passage are already detailed in the title—no further elucidation is needed.\"*\n\n**Titled:** *\"By the 12th day of the 7th month, on the cycle of **Jiāzǐ** (甲子), **Lǎozi** arrived at the pass. Xǐ knelt with hands raised and bowed deeply, inviting **Lǎozi** to his residence. He offered him a towel, comb, and water for washing and rinsing, then fasted and inquired about the **Dao/Way**. By the 25th day of the 12th month, Xǐ resigned his post under the pretext of illness. On the 28th day, **Lǎozi** gave him two volumes on **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.\"*\n\nXǐ bowed his head and begged to follow **Lǎozi** westward across the **flowing sands** (流沙). **Lǎozi** replied: *\"You have not yet attained it—how can you follow me far into the **flowing sands**? The lands beyond are strange, and the uncivilized peoples are difficult to transform. What method can you employ to resist evil?\n\nOnly when the **Dao/Way** is born within your belly and **spiritual clarity** (神明) is preserved can you remove defilements and cease restless thoughts, quiet your mind and hold fast to **Oneness** (一), maintain a thousand days of pure fasting, refine your form into perfection, and then you may seek me in **Chéngdū’s** (蜀都) **Qīngyáng Market** (青羊之肆). Otherwise, how could you?\"*\n\nXǐ bowed repeatedly and expressed gratitude. Suddenly, **Lǎozi** ascended into the sky, rising gradually toward **Tàiwēi** (太微).\n\nXǐ waited until the radiant light dispersed and the atmosphere grew still and empty. He then resided in the tower, fasting in solitude, excluding all servants and children. For three years, he recited the **sūtras**, and for a thousand days, he focused his mind with unwavering resolve. His spirit concentrated, his form dissolved, and his bones and flesh merged completely. In time, he mastered the subtleties of **counting the dharma** (穷数) and **reaching the transformations** (达变), and understood all the marvels of **changing form and essence** (因形移易).\n\nThus, he abandoned his home and left his lodgings, ascending freely and loftily. When he arrived at **Qīngyáng Market**, he met **Lǎozi**. **Lǎozi** then appointed him as **Wénshǐ** (文始) Master and together they journeyed into the **flowing sands** domain.\n\n**Commentary:** *\"This is the seventh section, which reveals the time **The Primordial Sage** spent at the pass transmitting the **sūtras**, as well as their second meeting at **Qīngyáng Market**. Within this section, there are two parts: the first clarifies the time of transmission at the pass; the second clarifies their second meeting at **Qīngyáng Market**.\"*\n\n**First:** *\"The 12th day of the 7th month, on the cycle of **Jiāzǐ**, **Lǎozi** arrived at the pass, and Xǐ knelt with hands raised and bowed deeply.\"*\n\nAs in *The Zhuangzi’s* **\"Rénjiānshì\"** (人间世): *\"Yán Huí daily knelt with hands raised and bowed deeply—this was the etiquette of a subject.\"* **Knèng** (擎) refers to raising the hands, **jì** (跽) to kneeling on the knees, and **qūquán** (曲拳) to bending the torso.\n\n**Second:** *\"The transmission of the two volumes on **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**.\"*\n\nAccording to *The Yín Xǐ Inner Transmission* (尹喜内传): *\"The **True Person** was originally a **Great Official** of **Zhōu Kāngwáng** (周康王). Skilled in observing celestial omens, he constructed a tower of grass at his residence—this is the **Lóuguān** (楼观) beneath **Zhōngnán Shān** today. Every time he ascended the tower to gaze, he saw the **purple qi** (紫气) hover over the pass, the **fusion wind** (融风) arrive three times, and the **Tianlǐ Star** (天理星) move westward, thus knowing that a **Sage** would cross the pass. By the time of **Zhāowáng** (昭王), he was requested to leave and become **Guān Lìng** of **Hángǔ Gǔ**. He swept the path, burned incense, and awaited the omen, ordering his guards, including **Sūn Jǐng** (孙景), sternly: ‘If any carriage or attire is unusual, or any figure bears extraordinary appearance, do not allow them to pass.

      "translated_text": "「Thus the Four Sages said: *\"Observing the encounter between Lǎojūn and Yǐn Shēng, could it not be that you have already dimly perceived the Way’s hidden workings?*\nYet those who cling to this humble phrase are merely seeking to teach the world the proper etiquette of receiving instruction.\n\nSo Yǐn Shēng invited Lǎojūn to his dwelling and prepared a seat, performing the rites of a disciple, bowing respectfully before him in service.\n\nLǎojūn asked: *\"Do you wish to propagate the vast and great Dao for the world?\"*\nYǐn Shēng replied: *\"The Great Sage is about to withdraw; I beg you to write a book for me.\"*\nThus, Lǎojūn bestowed the two treatises of *Dao* and *德* (virtue/power).\n\nAccording to *Guǎng Shèng Yì* (The Grand Sage’s Meaning), it was in the twenty-fifth year of King Zhāo of the Zhou dynasty, on the twelfth day of the seventh month, a day marked by *guǐchǒu* (甲子), that Lǎojūn crossed the pass. Why so? Because Yǐn Shēng served as a great officer of King Kāng, and by the time of King Zhāo, he held the post of *Hángǔ Guān* (函谷关令), thus enabling their meeting.\n\nHowever, according to Zàng Xuǎnjìng (臧玄静), in the time of King Yōu, when Lǎojūn departed through the Lǒng Guān (陇关), the year and month of his crossing the *Hángǔ Guān* (函谷关) differed entirely. Moreover, in the first year of King Yōu (庚申), and the eleventh year (庚午), there was no *guǐchǒu* (癸丑) within those years—this is clearly erroneous.\n\nFurthermore, Wén Rúhǎi (文如海) states that it was in the twenty-second year of King Chéng (成王) during *guǐchǒu* (癸丑) that he crossed the pass. This occurred before Yǐn Shēng’s time, meaning Lǎojūn could not have met him—another contradiction.\n\nIt is also said that in the forty-third year of King Píng (平王) during *guǐchǒu* (癸丑), he crossed the pass. Yet this was far after Yǐn Shēng’s era, making the dates entirely inconsistent—all these claims are merely speculative.\n\nNow, examining both ancient and modern accounts, the twenty-fifth year of King Zhāo of the Zhou dynasty, on the twelfth day of the seventh month, marked by *guǐchǒu* (甲子), is the most reliable date, as it aligns perfectly without doubt. The day and month of his crossing have already been established.\n\nAs for the timing of the transmission of the scriptures, according to *Guǎng Shèng Yì* (The Grand Sage’s Meaning), quoting *Gě Xiānwēng Nèi Zhuàn* (葛仙翁内传), in the time of the Yellow Emperor (Huángdì), Lǎojūn was known as *Guǎngchéngzǐ* (广成子), residing in *Kōngtóngshān* (空同山). There, he expounded the two treatises of *Dao* and *德* (virtue/power), along with the five methods of longevity (五茄之法), which were later called the Five Sacred Images (五圣图).\n\nAgain, the *Lǎojūn Nèi Zhuàn* (老君内传) states: In the time of Emperor Shùn (舜), Lǎojūn was called *Yǐn Shòuzǐ* (尹寿子), dwelling in *Héyáng* (河阳). He expounded the *Dao德经* (Dao/Virtue Classic) and taught the Dao of filial piety and fraternal duty without action (孝悌无为之道). The Emperor followed it, withdrawing his own power to let things unfold naturally, honoring the Dao and valuing virtue. Thus, he united the sixteen clans, known as the Eight Primordial (八元) and Eight Auspicious (八凯).\n\nHe banished the Four Evils (四凶), enlightened the Four Eyes (明四目), sharpened the Four Ears (达四聪), outwardly soothed the people, and inwardly cherished the nine clans. All under heaven followed him and transformed.\n\nConfucius said: *\"The one who ruled without action—was it not Shùn?\"*\nThe accounts of all these schools state that it was in the twenty-fifth year of King Zhāo of the Zhou dynasty, on the twelfth day of the seventh month, marked by *guǐchǒu* (甲子), that Lǎojūn crossed the pass. By that same year, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, Yǐn Shēng feigned illness and resigned his office, and on the twenty-eighth day of the same month, he received the two treatises of *Dao* and *德* (virtue/power).\n\nThe *Shǐjì Liè Zhuàn* (史记列传) records: *\"Lǎojūn wrote a book for Yǐn Shēng of over five thousand words.\"*\nAgain, Wáng Zǐnián’s *Shíyí Jì* (拾遗记) states: *\"When Lǎojūn was in the Zhou era, he resided in *Jǐngshìshān* (景室山) and often discussed matters of heaven and earth’s creation with the Five Elders (五老人), composing a book of over ten thousand words. Later, he edited out its redundancies, leaving only five thousand words.\"*\n\nNow, according to *Héshànggōng* (河上公) teaching the Han Emperor Wéndì (文帝) the *Shàngxià* (上下) two treatises of the *Dao德经* (Dao/Virtue Classic) and their annotations, he said to the Emperor: *\"Since I annotated this scripture, it has already been over seventeen hundred years. It has been passed down through three generations, and now to you, the fourth. Do not doubt its authenticity.\"*\n\nThis clearly shows that the scripture was not only spoken to Yǐn Shēng but also not composed in *Jǐngshìshān* (景室山).\n\nAgain, according to *Lièzǐ* (列子) quoting *Huángdì Shū* (黄帝书) in the chapter *Gǔshén Bùsǐ* (谷神不死), in the time of the Yellow Emperor (Huángdì), Lǎojūn was called *Guǎngchéngzǐ* (广成子) and expounded these two treatises of *Dao* and *德* (virtue/power). This is why the Yellow Emperor wrote the book, fully incorporating this chapter as proof.\n\nIn ancient times, the *Chōngtú Zhēnrén* (冲虚真人) expounded the celestial omens to his disciples, and according to what was seen in the Yellow Emperor’s book, it was called *Huángdì Shū* (黄帝书).\n\nSimilarly, there are many references in the *Zhuāng* (庄) and *Liè* (列) texts that cite Lǎodān (老聃) and Confucius as evidence, and later generations, when composing their own works and citing these texts as proof, often do not specify whether it is *Zhuāngzi* (庄子) or *Lièzi* (列子) saying it, nor do they distinguish whether it is Lǎodān (老聃) or Confucius speaking—it is all the same.\n\nAgain, considering the timeline of the scripture’s transmission: If it were indeed during King Zhāo’s time that Lǎojūn first wrote the book for Yǐn Shēng, then by the time of Emperor Wéndì of the Han, it would not have reached even a thousand years. Thus, *Héshànggōng* (河上公) could not have claimed that his annotations had been seventeen hundred years in the making. It was passed down through three generations, and now to you, the fourth.\n\nBy this reasoning, the differing accounts of the years prove that the scripture was first transmitted in the time of the Yellow Emperor, then again in the time of Emperor Shùn, thirdly in Yǐn Shēng’s time, and fourthly in Emperor Wéndì’s time.\n\nHence, it is said that the scripture has been passed down through three generations, and now to you, the fourth. I suspect that the seventeen hundred years should actually be two thousand three hundred years.\n\nWhy is that?」",

I pray you may show kindness and instruction, and save those lost in darkness.\"*\n\nSince **Lǎojūn** had passed all three tests, he smiled contentedly and said: *\"I know you have a connection with the Dao, so I came to test you. Now that you know me, I too know you. After repeated exchanges like this, I shall grant your request.\"*",

      "translated_text": "From the time of the Yellow Emperor through the reigns of Zhuanxu, Gaoxin, Tang, and Yu, roughly **385 years** passed. Then, from Shun through the Three Dynasties, the Qin, and until the first year of Emperor Xiaowen of the Han, **2,101 years** were recorded. From the Yellow Emperor down to Emperor Xiaowen of the Han, the total spans **2,386 years**.\n\nI suspect that since **Ge Xian Weng** compiled the *Preface to the Commentary on the Two Daoist Scriptures of Heshang Gong*, the passage of time has been long, and it is likely that the original **2,000 characters** were mistakenly written as **1,000**, while **385 years** was misrecorded as **785 years**—perhaps an error in carving the woodblocks.\n\nMoreover, from the Yellow Emperor to the time of Shun, roughly **385 years** elapsed. Shun lived to **100 years**, ruled for **39 years**, and passed the throne to Yu. From Yu to Jie, **17 generations** of descendants succeeded one another over **432 years**, until he was overthrown by Tang. From Tang to Zhou, **31 generations** followed in **629 years**, until they were destroyed by the Zhou. The Zhou, from King Wu to King Pian, spanned **37 generations** and **867 years**, until they were conquered by the Qin. The Qin, from King Zhao Xiang to the end of Child Ying, endured **45 years**, until they were overthrown by the Han. The Han, from Emperor Gaozu through Empress Lü, Emperor Hui, and down to the first year of Emperor Wendi, lasted **28 years**. Altogether, from the Yellow Emperor to Emperor Xiaowen of the Han, the total reaches **over 2,300 years**—this is now clear.\n\nI also suspect that the term *注* (commentary) should properly be rendered as *着* (composing). Why is that?\n\nThe act of *注* is to annotate and explain meaning, while *着* is to manifest and display meaning—*着* also means \"to compose.\" I believe that in the time of the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun, these were all sacred texts created by the sages to save the world and establish laws, and there was no need for annotations or elucidations. Therefore, it is appropriate to say: *\"Since the Yellow Emperor composed this scripture, over 2,300 years have passed.\"* This implies that from the Yellow Emperor’s revelation of the Dao, through Shun, Yinxu, and Emperor Wendi’s time, it is merely a transmission. Hence, it is said: *\"The scripture has been passed down through three generations, now reaching you, the fourth.\"* Scholars of refinement should ponder this carefully.\n\nThe second reason is to clarify that after the Yellow Emperor transmitted the scripture to Yinxu, they further convened in the market of Qingyang in Shu Prefecture. The text states:\n\n*\"Yinxu knelt and begged, 'May I follow the Old Master westward across the Flowing Sands?' The Old Master replied, 'You have not yet attained the Dao—how can you follow me to distant lands like the Flowing Sands?'*\n\nThe Flowing Sands are a distant realm, where the uncivilized and stubborn are difficult to transform—*犷* (guang) means crude and unrefined. But what method can subdue evil? Only by nurturing the Dao within the body, preserving divine clarity, and practicing purity of mind—ceasing all defilements, halting all thoughts, quieting the heart, and abiding in the One—through a thousand days of strict fasting, refining the form to its essence, can one then seek me in the market of Qingyang in Shu. How else could this be?*\n\nYinxu bowed repeatedly in gratitude. After the Old Master finished transmitting the scripture, he suddenly ascended in a rising mist to the **Taiwei** constellation. The Taiwei is one of the celestial enclosures—*Zimwei* (紫微垣) is the dwelling of the Northern Pole Sovereign, *Tianshi* (天市垣) that of the Southern Pole Sovereign, and *Taiwei* (太微垣) the abode of the Heavenly Sovereign. The *Guangshengyi* (《广圣义》) states: *\"The Old Master, in the stars, is the Heavenly Sovereign.\"* Hence, it is said that he ascended to the Taiwei.\n\nThe *Xishengjing* (《西升经》) says:\n\n*\"After the Old Master finished his teaching, he vanished suddenly. In a moment, his palace radiated a five-colored celestial glow—yellow, green, black, white, and azure. Yinxu emerged from the courtyard, knelt, and said, 'I beg the divine person to appear once more and grant me a single essential principle, so that I may abide in the Origin.' Immediately, he looked upward and saw the Old Master suspended in the air, tens of yards above the ground. His form was that of a golden man, appearing and disappearing indistinctly, with no fixed age—now old, now young. The Old Master said, 'I solemnly admonish you: guard this well. Cease all defilements, halt all thoughts, quiet your heart, and abide in the One. When all defilements are removed and all affairs concluded, this is the essence of my Dao.' After his admonition, he vanished. Yinxu waited until the radiance dispersed and the surroundings fell silent, then ascended to his chamber, fasting and purifying himself. He excluded all servants, recited the scripture for three years, and meditated deeply for a thousand days. His mind became concentrated, his form dissolved, and his bones and flesh merged into one.*\n\n*Concentration of the mind and dissolution of the form, the merging of bones and flesh*—this is what **Liezi’s** teacher, Lao Shang’s friend **Bo Gaozi**, achieved after nine years of learning the art of riding the wind. At that point, whatever his mind focused upon or whatever his mouth spoke of, he no longer knew whether it was beneficial or harmful to himself, nor whether it was beneficial or harmful to others. He no longer recognized his teacher or his friend, as his inner and outer distinctions had vanished. Then, his eyes became like ears, ears like nostrils, nostrils like mouth—all senses indistinguishable. His mind concentrated, his form dissolved, and his bones and flesh merged into one. He did not realize what he leaned upon or what he stepped on, drifting east and west with the wind like a dry leaf or empty shell. He did not know whether the wind carried him or if he carried the wind.\n\n*凝* (ning) means steadfast; *释* (shi) means to abandon; *融* (rong) means harmony. This describes how internally, his spirit was steadfast and concentrated, while externally, his body and its orifices were uniformly harmonized into one.\n\nThe *Liezi* also states: *\"The heart dies, the form dissolves.\"* Hence, it is said: *\"The mind concentrated, the form dissolved, and the bones and flesh merged into one,\"* meaning that Yinxu also attained such profound techniques.\n\nEventually, he exhausted the subtle mysteries of numbers and transformations, and mastered the marvels of altering form through its essence—nothing was beyond his grasp.\n\n*Exhausting the subtle mysteries of numbers and transformations, mastering the marvels of altering form*—this is what the *Chongxu Jing* (《冲虚经》) refers to in the section on King Mu of Zhou: *\"Laochengzi learned the art of illusion from the words of Mr. Yinwen.\"* Mr. Yinwen told Laochengzi:\n\n*\"Exhausting the subtle mysteries of numbers and transformations, mastering the marvels of altering form—this is called transformation, this is called illusion.\"*",

But the dragon—how can I know it rides the wind and clouds to ascend to heaven, nourished by yin and yang, wandering in the **Supreme Clarity** [太清]? I could not follow it. Today, I saw **Laozi**—he is like the dragon.\"*\n\nThe *Shu* [疏] says: *\"This is the eighth chapter, which clarifies that the **Highest Venerable** [太上] returned to the Central States during the reign of King You of Zhou. Thus, **Confucius** went to Zhou and was able to ask about **ritual**, and he sighed, saying that **Laozi** was like the dragon.\"*\n\nEarlier, **Confucius** told **Nan Rong Jing Shu** [南宫敬叔]: *\"I have heard that **Laozi** [老聃] is vast in ancient knowledge and clear in present understanding, mastering the origins of **ritual** and **music** [礼乐], illuminating the return of **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** [道德之归].

The simplicity of black and white is not sufficient to distinguish them, and the observation of fame and shame is not enough to broaden their essence. Fish in a dried-up spring, together on dry land, moistening each other with spittle, nourishing each other with droplets—this is not as good as forgetting each other in the vast rivers and lakes [江湖].\"*\n\n*\"Now, the person you speak of—his flesh and bones have long since decayed. Only his words remain with you.\"*\n\nAs **Confucius** was about to leave Zhou, **Lao Shi** [老耻] said: *\"I have heard that the wealthy give others wealth, and the benevolent give others words. I have borrowed the title of the benevolent, so I ask to give you words in parting.*\n\n*\"In general, those scholars of the present age who are keenly insightful yet close to death [近於死者] are fond of criticizing others. Those who are widely learned and eloquent yet endanger themselves are fond of exposing others’ faults. As a subject, one must not harbor personal ambitions; as a son, one must not resent one’s parents. Moreover, the gentleman rides the wind when his time is right; if his time is not right, he travels with a straw hat and coarse matting [蓬累]. The straw hat and coarse matting [蓬累] are coarse hats and mats [籉笠]. A wise merchant hides his wealth as though he were empty, and a gentleman of great **virtue/power** appears with humble bearing, as though foolish. Abandon your arrogance and excessive desires, your haughty demeanor and licentious thoughts—these are all of no benefit to you. This is all I have to tell you.\"*\n\nWhen **Confucius** returned, he remained silent for three days. His disciples were puzzled and asked him: *\"Master, why do you not speak? What did you learn from **Laozi**?\"*\n\n**Confucius** said: *\"When we were in Lu, if someone’s thoughts were vast as a flying goose [飞鸿], I would shape my thoughts like a bow or crossbow and shoot them down, never failing to hit and surpass them. If someone’s thoughts were leisurely as a wandering deer [游鹿], I would shape my thoughts like a hunting dog and pursue them, never failing to catch and strike them. If someone’s thoughts were deep as a fish in a well, sunk in the ninefold abyss [九重之渊], I would shape my thoughts like a hook or fishing line [钧缴], and cast them in, never failing to retrieve and control them. But when I saw the dragon, I could not comprehend it. The dragon, when gathered, forms a complete body; when dispersed, becomes a pattern of scales. It rides the clouds and qi, nourishes itself in yin and yang, and wanders in the **Supreme Clarity** [太清]. I could not follow it. Today, I saw **Laozi**—he is like the dragon.

His lifespan—whether short or long—none could know. Thus, the people of his time named him the **Hidden Sage**.\n\nIn the **Yōu-Lǐ era** [幽、厉之世], the world was in chaos, the **Dao/Way of Zhou** in decay. Therefore, the **Supreme Clarity** changed his name and title to obscure himself—sometimes called **Laozi**, sometimes **Taishi Dù**. One account says **Laozi**, at over seventy years old, still had his mother alive, and to honor her, he wore patterned garments, or feigned childish stumbles and cries to delight her. Such was his filial piety. **Taishi Dù**, during the **Yōu-Lǐ era**, served as a historian—another of the **Supreme Clarity’s** hidden names.\n\nSome say he received the **Dao/Way** from **Rongcheng**.\n*The Liezi* states: *\"Only the Yellow Emperor and Rongchengzi dwelled upon the Kunlun peaks, fasting together for three months.\"* Thus, **Rongcheng** was a figure of the Yellow Emperor’s time.\n\nSome say he inquired of **Changzhu**.\n**Changzhu**—unknown from which dynasty—his source unclear—was simply a sage of his time.\n\nThe **Supreme Clarity**, as the **Ancestor of the Great Dao/Way** and **Source of Ten Thousand Teachings**, is either the **Master of Ten Thousand Heavens** or the **Teacher of Hundred Kings**. How could he require disciples to know the **Dao/Way** for him? It is merely to emphasize that the **Dao/Way** must have its revered teachers, and doctrine its guiding masters. Thus, he assumed the guise of a disciple to illustrate the method of transmission—all metaphorical, as when **Confucius** said: *\"I was not born knowing; I loved antiquity and sought it earnestly.\"* The intent is the same.\n\nSome say he lived to over a hundred and sixty, others to over two hundred—his longevity from cultivating the **Dao/Way** and nourishing life. Seeing the **Dao/Way of Zhou** decline, he re-emerged beyond the pass, now hidden, now manifest, yet none could confirm his deeds. The people of his time thus called him the **Hidden Sage**.\nHence, the *Records of the Grand Historian’s* **Laozi Biography** states: *\"Laozi was sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed, living over two hundred years before entering the western deserts, his end unknown—truly the **Hidden Sage**.\"*\n\nThe term **\"Sage\"** [君] is a noble title for one of **Dao/Way**, while **\"Child\"** [子] is an honorific for one of **virtue/power** [德].\nAnciently, teachers were also called **\"Child.\"**\nThose who teach others, possessing both **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, are called **\"Sages.\"**\nThus, a **\"Sage\"** is one who is both a **Master** and a **Teacher**.\n*The Book of Rites* says: *\"The scholar who can expound broadly is one who can become a teacher. The teacher who can instruct broadly is one who can become a leader. The leader who governs broadly is one who can become a **Sage-King**.\"*\nTo be a **Sage-King** and a **Teacher**, one’s **virtue/power** must be vast and luminous—thus, they are called **\"Sages.\"**\nAnother interpretation: Even among the common folk, if one possesses **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, they are revered as **\"Sages.\"**\nBut if one lacks **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, though elevated in rank, they are despised as **\"petty men\"** [小人].\nThus, **Dao/Way** compares to **Sage-Kingship**, **virtue/power** to **Teachership**—only then is one a **\"Sage.\"**\nHow much more fitting, then, that the **Primordial Emperor, Supreme Clarity Laozi**, as the **Source of Dao/Way and Virtue/Power**, the **Model for Emperors and Kings**, should be called a **\"Sage\"**?\nBecause he descended like a dragon, humble in station, his comings and goings unfathomable, he is called the **Hidden Sage**.\n\n**题曰：**\nThe name of **Laozi’s** son was **Zōng**.\n**Zōng** served **Wei** as a general, earning a fief at **Duàngān**.\n**Zōng’s** son was **Zhù**, **Zhù’s** son was **Gōng**, and **Gōng’s** distant descendant was **Jiǎ**.\n**Jiǎ** served under **Emperor Wen of Han**, and **Jiǎ’s** son was **Xiè**, who held the seal of **King Jiaoxi** as **Grand Tutor**, thus settling his family in **Qi**.\n*\"Print\"* [印] here refers to the name of **King Jiaoxi**.\n\n**疏曰：**\nThis is the **tenth gate**, illustrating how the **Supreme Clarity**, embracing **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**, concealed his sagehood among the common folk, his lineage enduring through generations, with unbroken ancestral rites.\n\nThe text is already clear; no further elucidation is needed.\n\n**题曰：**\nWhere there are **Heaven and Earth**, there is **Dao/Way and skill** [道术]. The guardians of the **Dao/Way** have never been absent since time began.\nFrom **Fuxi** onward, through the **Three Dynasties**, eminent **Dao/Way-guardians** have appeared in every age.\nAs for **Laozi**, though born a mortal, he was among the most refined in attaining the **Dao/Way**.\nThe common folk, seeing his longevity and his white hair from birth, thus called him **\"Laozi.\"**\n*\"Lao\"* is an honorific for the aged, *\"zi\"* a general appellation.\n\n**疏曰：**\nThis is the **eleventh gate**, clarifying that the **Supreme Clarity** was a mortal of exceptional **Dao/Way-attainment**, thus bearing the name **\"Laozi.\"**\n\nOriginally, at the dawn of **Heaven and Earth’s** unfolding, human hearts were pure and undivided, the **Dao/Way** unsullied and unscattered. Though the name of **\"Dao/Way and skill\"** had not yet emerged, its essence already permeated the world.\nAfter **Fuxi**, writing and contracts arose, laws and institutions gradually took form, and the **Dao/Way-guardians** thereby gained renown.\nFrom the **Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors** down to the **Three Kings and Five Hegemons**, our **Supreme Clarity** has, in every age, served as their teacher, instructing the rulers of his time, establishing laws and statutes for the benefit of posterity. Thus, those skilled in **Dao/Way and technique** have never been absent, hence the statement: *\"Eminent **Dao/Way-guardians** appear in every age.\"*\n\nOnly our **Supreme Clarity**, though born a mortal, was among the most refined in attaining the **Dao/Way**.\nThe people saw his longevity and his perpetually aged appearance, thus naming him **\"Laozi.\"**",

      "translated_text": "「According to the *Guangsheng Yi* [广圣义], it states: The **Laozi** [老子] was born from the **jewel embryo** [琼胎], nurtured by **Supreme Wisdom** [寄慧] for eighty-one years, and upon his sacred birth, he was born with a snowy-white head. The **Supreme Mother** [圣母] thus bestowed upon him his name to reveal this to the world.\n\nWithin this **Dao/Way-teaching** [道] tradition, there are five distinct interpretations of his name:\n\n1. The **Supreme Clarity** [圣人] descended into the mortal realm, differing from the common folk. The **Supreme Mother** [圣母] named him **\"Lao\"** [老] because he was born aged, and **\"zi\"** [子] because he was newborn. As he was also born with a white head, these two terms were combined, thus he is called **Laozi** [老子].\n\n2. He illuminates the **Dao/Way** [道] in opposition to worldly conventions. **\"Lao\"** [老] signifies longevity, while **\"zi\"** [子] denotes youth. Though mortals age from youth to old age, the **Supreme Clarity** [太上] was aged at birth and later attained youth, thus clarifying his retreat from the world to return to his primordial essence.\n\n3. **\"Lao\"** [老] means \"examine\" or \"test,\" for he scrutinizes all sages. **\"Zi\"** [子] means \"procreate,\" for he gives birth to all things. Thus, the **Old Master** [老君] is the progenitor of all beings and the patriarch of all sages, hence his name as **\"Laozi\"** [老子]—examiner and progenitor.\n\n4. The **Supreme Clarity** [圣人] bestows his name in reverse, from end to beginning. **\"Lao\"** [老] signifies the end, while **\"zi\"** [子] signifies the beginning. Though mortals begin with youth and end with age, the **Old Master** [老君] begins with age and returns to youth, urging all to cultivate the **Dao/Way** [道] by reversing aging and returning to infancy. Hence, he is called **Laozi** [老子].\n\n5. He abandons traces and harmonizes with the world, conforming to its ways. **\"Lao\"** [老] is used because he was born with a white head, hence appearing aged. **\"Zi\"** [子] is a common term for males, akin to how **Confucius** [孔子], **Mencius** [孟子], **Zhuangzi** [庄子], and **Liezi** [列子] are named by their surnames. **Laozi** [老子], **Huguanzi** [鹖冠子], **Baopuzi** [抱朴子], and **Huainanzi** [淮南子] derive their names from their teachings or deeds. The **Preface to the Secrets** [序诀] states: The name **Laozi** [老子] originated from countless **kalpas** [劫] ago, its meaning vast and profound, stretching infinitely into the distant past. This is not because he was aged at birth but because he existed long before countless **kalpas** [劫], hence the name **Lao** [老]. Indeed, he was born from the **Supreme Mother** [圣母], emerging from her left flank, his head already snowy-white, and thus named **Laozi** [老子]. His name **Laozi** [老子] arose from the **Mysterious** [玄], predating heaven and earth, without the bounds of aging or decline, hence **Laozi** [老子]. This is the testimony of the **Preface to the Secrets** [序诀].\n\nExamining these interpretations closely, his name was not conferred due to his aged appearance at birth. Rather, the **Old Master** [老君] taught the **Dao/Way** [道] across countless **kalpas** [劫], manifested his form, and perpetually appeared aged, thus earning the name **Laozi** [老子]. The name **Laozi** [老子] emerged at this time, but the title **Old Master** [老君] predates the countless **kalpas** [劫] before it.\n\nIt is also said: When the **Old Master** [老君] was about to reveal the great teachings and spread the **Dao/Way-transformations** [化] across the world, he declared: *\"The **Dao/Way** [道] cannot lack a revered teacher, and the teachings cannot lack a sovereign master.\"* Thus, he became a disciple of the **Supreme Clarity, Yucun** [太上玉宸大道君], who is the **Divine Lord of Primordial Beginning** [元始天尊]'s student. The **Divine Lord of the **Dao/Way** [道君] is the origin of **Dao/Way** [道] and the source of its penetration, born before countless **kalpas** [劫], as the ancestor of **Dao-essence** [道炁]. Hence, he is called the **Great Divine Lord of the **Dao/Way** [大道君]. The **Divine Lord of Primordial Beginning** [元始天尊] is the sovereign of countless heavens and the ruler of countless worlds, born before the vast **kalpa** [浩劫], as the fundamental root of **Dao-essence** [道炁].\n\nThe **Divine Lord of Primordial Beginning** [元始天尊], the **Supreme Clarity, Yucun** [太上大道君], and the **Old Master** [老君] span both celestial and earthly realms, their transformations boundless. They were born before countless **kalpas** [劫] and endure eternally thereafter, revered by all heavens and followed by all emperors, thus bestowed the true title **Supreme Clarity, Old Master** [太上老君]. The three sages, as teachers, established the hierarchy of those who transmit the teachings.\n\n**\"Tai\"** [太] denotes the utmost extent of greatness. **\"Shang\"** [上] denotes the utmost height. **\"Lao\"** [老] denotes the utmost longevity. **\"Jun\"** [君] denotes the utmost reverence. Thus, the **Supreme Clarity, Old Master** [太上老君] is the most exalted in greatness, height, longevity, and reverence, surpassing the **Five Supreme Clarities** [五太], embodying the full essence of the **Four Extremes** [四极]. Hence, he is called **Supreme Clarity, Old Master** [太上老君]. The title **Old Master** [老君] originates from this.\n\nMoreover, **\"Tai Shang\"** [太上] is explained in the *Guangsheng Yi* [广圣义] as the sovereign title for the **Dao/Way-teaching** [教] and the ultimate attainment of **sainthood** [圣]. It is further elucidated: **\"Tai\"** [太] means \"great,\" with none greater than **\"Tai\"** [太]. **\"Shang\"** [上] means \"high,\" with none higher than **\"Shang\"** [上]. Thus, it signifies the highest rank of one who cultivates **Dao/Way** [道] and attains ultimate fruition.\n\nSimilarly, mortals who practice **Dao/Way** [道] progress from the common to **Dao/Way** [道], from **Dao/Way** [道] to **immortality** [仙], from **immortality** [仙] to **authentic** [真], and from **authentic** [真] to **sage** [圣]. The ultimate rank of **sainthood** [圣] ascends to **Tai Shang** [太上]. **Tai Shang** [太上] possesses all six **perfections** [六通] and ten thousand **virtues/powers** [万德], inheriting the **Dharma-ruler’s** [法王] position and overseeing all sages, thus attaining this sovereign and ultimate title. Just as worldly emperors, succeeding in their lineage, are called **Tai Shang Huangdi** [太上皇], so too is this.\n\nSince the **Divine Lord of Primordial Beginning** [元始天尊], there have been **Tai Shang Da Dao Jun** [太上大道君], **Tai Shang Lao Jun** [太上老君], **Tai Shang Zhangren** [太上丈人], and **Tai Shang Gao Huangdi** [太上高皇帝]. Though they share this sovereign and ultimate title, they do not transmit the teachings.\n\nOnly the **Great Divine Lord of the **Dao/Way** [大道君] and the **Supreme Clarity, Old Master** [太上老君] are the sovereigns of all heavens and the patriarchs of all teachings. Thus, in the **Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries** [三洞四辅], as well as in all scriptures, the title **\"Tai Shang\"** [太上] is prepended to their names, signifying that **\"Tai Shang\"** [太上] is the sovereign title for the **Dao/Way-teaching** [教] and the ultimate attainment of **sainthood** [圣].\n\nThe names **Laozi** [老子], **Old Master** [老君], and **Supreme Clarity** [太上] have been briefly explained above. Yet, the **Supreme Clarity** [太上] conforms to the **Dharma** [法] and manifests his name through the ages, with the number of his **kalpas** [劫] as boundless as the sands of the **Huan River** [洹]. Why so?\n\nAccording to the *Xisheng Jing* [西升经], since the beginning of this world, the changes have been as numerous as the sands of the earth, and the slightest movement brings forth a **kalpa** [劫]. Indeed, the **Old Master** [老君] has endured countless hardships.\n\nThe *Youlong Zhuan* [犹龙传] further states: The **Old Master** [老君] was born in the **void** [空洞], his transformations natural and spontaneous. His wisdom is boundless, his **virtue/power** [圣德] complete. His form cannot be measured, and his names are without end. In heaven, he is the sovereign of all heavens; among sages, he is the ruler of all sages; among **immortals** [仙], he is the total of all **immortals** [仙]; among the **authentic** [真], he is the first of all **authentic** [真]; among the stars, he is the **Celestial Emperor** [天皇大帝]; in teaching, he is the **Supreme Clarity, Old Master** [太上老君]. Sometimes he manifests a thousand two hundred names, sometimes reveals one hundred eighty titles, sometimes as the **Father of Non-Action** [无为父], sometimes as the **Mother of All Things** [万物母]. He cycles with the **Great Dao** [大道], as the root of heaven and earth. His vast and boundless presence cannot be named exhaustively.",

      "translated_text": "The **Emerald Void** [碧虚] thus states: *\"This discourse on the names of Laozi is a brief account.\"* Now, examining all the scriptures and expanding upon it, we speak of the full details. The **Supreme Virtue/Power** [太上之德]—how vast is it not?\n\nThe text reads: *\"Since one receives the mandate, there are those who inherently possess divine penetration and transcendent insight.\"* Endowed with **qi** [气] unlike common mortals, they should naturally be the sovereigns of the **Dao** [道]. Thus, they can be aided by the **Celestial Deities** [天神], followed by all **immortals** [仙]. Therefore, the methods they propagate to deliver the world—such as the **Nine Elixirs and Eight Stones** [九丹八石], **jade nectar and golden liquid** [玉醴金液], preserving the **True Essence** [真] and guarding the **Original** [元], contemplating the **spirit** [神] and traversing the **inner chambers** [藏], cultivating **qi** [气] and refining the form, dispelling calamities and warding off evils, commanding ghosts and nourishing the nature, abstaining from grains and undergoing transformation, averting rigid constraints and issuing precepts, or enslaving specters and demons—all these are the **Supreme Clarity, Old Master**’s [太上老君] habitual practices for saving the world, not the ultimate of the ultimate.\n\nMoreover, in governing households and states, even extending to the realm, these are but the **Dao**’s [道] earthly shepherds and the **Sages**’ [圣人] secondary affairs. As the **Zhuangzi’s \"Let the King Rule\"** [《庄子让王篇》] states: *\"The **True Dao** [道之真] is used to govern the self; its remnants are applied to the state, and earthly shepherds to rule the world.\"* The remnants are like the coarse threads of silk—first, one must extract the refined strands before the silk is revealed. Silk is the **True Essence** [真], while the remnants are the **coarse** [赢]. The remnants are not yet the **True Essence** [真], how much less so their leavings?\n\nAgain, as in selecting vegetables: the **True Essence** [真] is the vegetable itself. Earthly shepherds are but the **dung and soil** [粪壤], coarse and unrefined things. All the aforementioned methods are expedient teachings tailored to the circumstances for superficial deliverance of the world. Hence, the **Emerald Void** [碧虚] concludes that these are not the ultimate of the ultimate, but rather the **Dao**’s [道] earthly shepherds and the **Sages**’ [圣人] secondary affairs—is this not fitting?\n\nThe ultimate of the ultimate is the **True Dao** [道之真] used to govern the self. The text states: *\"Laozi was tranquil and non-acting, solely devoted to longevity. Thus, though he remained long in the Zhou dynasty without advancing in rank or position, he sought to harmonize with the mundane, internally embodying naturalness. He valued the **Dao**’s [道] subtle and void essence, adapting to transformations through non-action, and so wrote books of profound mystery and unrecognizability, while the **Dao** [道] was achieved, he departed—this is the so-called Broad and Great **True Person** [博大真人].\"*",

      "original_text": "疏曰：此第十三门明太上以恬淡无为，守之於内，和光同尘，应之於外，是所谓博大真人也。 题曰老子恬淡无为，专以长生为务者。 《南华经刻意篇》云：夫恬淡寂寞，虚无无为，此天地之平，道德之质也。 故圣人休休焉，则平易矣。 平易则恬淡矣。 平易恬淡，则忧息不能入，邪气不能袭，故其德全而神不亏，此长生之道也。 故碧虚称太上恬淡无为，专以长生为务者，以此。 次云在周虽久，而名位不迁者。 夫老君自文、武历成、康，及昭王时出关，至幽、厉、平、定之世，前后数百年，止不过藏史、柱史、太史之职而已。 故云在周虽久，而名位不迁也。 盖欲和光同尘，尘，之於外，虚无自然，实之於内，如有世务，因其所感，不得已而应之，抑又守无为之道，顺变化之理，故云虚无因应也。 《庄子刻意篇》云：感而后应，迫而后动，不得已而后起也。 夫太上之道，出处语默也如此，岂常人之所能测者哉。 故碧虚叹云：其着书也称微妙难识，道成乃去，是所谓博大真人也。 经云：古之善为士者，微妙玄通，深不可识。 《庄子大宗师篇》云：真人之息以踵，众人之息以喉，其嗜欲深者天机浅，是知真人之容，道根深远，众人固不识也。 何则？ 庄子云：纯素之道，唯神是守，守而勿失，与神为一，一之精通，合乎天伦。 天，自然也。 伦，理也。 既与神为一，则精智无碍，故冥乎自然之理也。 野语有之曰：众人重利，康士重名，贤士尚志，圣人贵精。 故素也者，谓其无所与杂也，纯也者，谓其不亏其神也。 能体纯素，谓之真人。 且常人至此犹日真人，况我太上老君为万道之祖，众教之宗。 故碧虚引《南华经天下篇》云：以深为根，以约为纪，曰坚则毁矣，锐则挫矣，常宽容於物，不削於人，可谓至极。 关尹老聘乎，古之博大真人哉，不亦宜乎。 题曰：且老子之子孙，祭杞不辗，而升於玉京。 庄子之鼓盆送妻，而入侍帝宸，皆为道之宗师者，故使后世之人，信其长生可学，非神异而学不能及也。 是曰方外之教，有淳古之风焉。 疏曰：此第十四门明太上、庄子，亦有妻室子孙，然为大道之宗师者，欲使世人知长生之道，可方学而致，非神异而学不能及也。 题曰：且老子之子孙，祭祀不辍，而升於玉京者。 经云：善建者不技，善抱者不脱，子孙祭祀不辍，此本经第五十四章之文也。 其旨已具本章中消释。 升玉京者，《度人经》云：郁罗萧台，玉山上京，上极无上，大罗玉清，渺渺劫仞，若亡若存，此三清上圣之所居也。 举大罗玉清，则上清、太清在其中可知矣。 故云升於玉京也。 次云庄子鼓盆送妻，而入侍帝宸者。 《南华经至乐篇》云：庄子妻死，惠子吊之，庄子方箕踞，音锯，言垂足踞傲而坐也。 鼓盆而歌。 惠子曰：与人居，长子，老，身死，不哭亦足矣。 又鼓盆而歌，不亦甚乎。 庄子曰：不然，是其始死也，我独何能无巢，然察其始而本无生，非徒无生也，而本无形，非徒无形也，而本无气，杂乎芒苜之间，变而有气，气变而有形，形变而有生，今又变而之死，是相与为春秋冬夏四时行也。 人且偃然寝于巨室，以天地为室也。 我噭噭然随而哭之，自以为不通命，故止也。 又云：入侍帝宸者，按《丹台新录》云：庄子升为太玄博士，乃仙职也。",
      "translated_text": "The commentary states: This is the **Thirteenth Gate**, which elucidates how the **Supreme Sage** [太上] maintained inner tranquility through **serene simplicity and non-action**, while outwardly harmonizing with the world. This is what is called the **Broad and Great True Person** [博大真人]. The text states: *\"Laozi was serene and non-acting, solely devoted to longevity.\"*\n\nThe *Southern Flower Scripture* [《南华经》] *Chapter on Intentions* [《刻意篇》] says:\n*\"Serene simplicity, stillness, and emptiness—this is the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth, the essence of **Dao** and **virtue** [道德]. Thus, the **Sage** rests in repose, and so attains simplicity. Simplicity leads to serene simplicity. When serene and simple, worries cannot enter, and malevolent **qi** cannot assail. Thus, his **virtue** is complete, and his spirit unharmed—this is the **Way** of longevity.\"*\n\nTherefore, the **Emerald Void** [碧虚] praises the **Supreme Sage** as one who was serene and non-acting, solely devoted to longevity, for this very reason.\n\nNext, it states: *\"Though he remained long in the Zhou dynasty without advancing in rank or position.\"* Indeed, Laozi, from the time of **Wen** and **Wu** through **Cheng** and **Kang**, until the reign of **Zhao Wang**, departed the pass during the **You** and **Li** dynasties, spanning hundreds of years. Yet, he held only the positions of **Historian** [藏史], **Pillar Historian** [柱史], or **Grand Historian** [太史]. Thus, it is said: *\"Though he remained long in the Zhou dynasty without advancing in rank or position.\"*\n\nHe sought to harmonize with the world externally, while internally embodying emptiness and naturalness. When worldly affairs arose, he responded only when compelled, adhering to the **Way** of non-action and aligning with the principles of transformation. Hence, it is said: *\"He adapted through emptiness and non-action.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* *Chapter on Intentions* states:\n*\"Only when moved does one respond; only when pressed does one act; only when unavoidable does one rise.\"*\n\nThe **Supreme Sage’s** **Dao** in retreat, presence, speech, and silence was thus—how could ordinary people comprehend it? Therefore, the **Emerald Void** sighs: *\"His writings were profound and unrecognizable; when the **Dao** was achieved, he departed—this is what is called the **Broad and Great True Person**.\"*\n\nThe scripture says:\n*\"The ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, mysterious, and profound—deeply unrecognizable.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* *Chapter on the Great Master* states:\n*\"The **True Person’s** breathing reaches the soles of his feet, while commoners breathe at their throats. Those with deep desires have shallow **Heavenly Mechanism** [天机]. Thus, the **True Person’s** demeanor is rooted in **Dao**, profound and distant—commoners cannot recognize it.\"*\n\nWhy? *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The **Way** of purity and simplicity is guarded solely by the spirit. Guard it without loss, and it merges with the spirit. When perfectly unified, it aligns with **Heavenly Order** [天伦]. **Heaven** is nature; **Order** is principle. Once merged with the spirit, wisdom flows unimpeded, thus attaining the mysterious and natural.\"*\n\nA folk saying goes:\n*\"Commoners value profit, the virtuous value fame, the worthy value aspiration, and the **Sage** values purity.\"*\n\nThus, *purity* means unmixed, and *simplicity* means untainted spirit. To embody purity and simplicity is to be a **True Person**. Even ordinary people call this the **True Person**—how much more so for **Laozi**, the ancestor of all **Dao**s and the master of all teachings?\n\nTherefore, the **Emerald Void** cites the *Southern Flower Scripture* *Chapter on the World* [《天下篇》]:\n*\"Rooted in depth, governed by restraint—rigidity invites destruction, sharpness invites blunting. Always accommodating to things, never diminishing others—this is the ultimate.\"*\n\n**Guan Yin** and **Lao Dan**—were they not the **Broad and Great True Persons** of antiquity? Is this not fitting?\n\nThe text states: *\"Moreover, Laozi’s descendants performed unceasing sacrifices at **Qi** [杞], ascending to **Yujing** [玉京]. **Zhuangzi**, beating his basin to send off his wife, then entered to serve the **Celestial Sovereign** [帝宸]—both were masters of the **Dao**, causing later generations to believe that longevity was attainable through study, not through supernatural feats alone.\"*\n\nThis is called the **Teaching Beyond the Square** [方外之教], preserving the pure antiquity.\n\nThe commentary states: This is the **Fourteenth Gate**, which clarifies that the **Supreme Sage** and **Zhuangzi**, though they had wives, children, and descendants, were masters of the **Great Dao**. They sought to show the world that the **Way** of longevity could be attained through study, not through supernatural feats alone.\n\nThe text states: *\"Moreover, Laozi’s descendants performed unceasing sacrifices at **Qi**.\"* The scripture says:\n*\"The skilled builder does not cling; the skilled embrace does not abandon. Descendants continue sacrifices unceasingly—this is the text of the original *Chapter Fifty-Four*.\"*\n\nIts meaning has already been elucidated in this chapter.\n\n*\"Ascending to **Yujing**\"*—the *Scripture on Guiding the People* [《度人经》] says:\n*\"The **Yùluóxiāo Terrace**, the **Jade Mountain Upper Capital**, the **Supreme Beyond Supreme**, the **Great Luo Jade Purity**—vast and boundless, like the void, as if nonexistent yet existing. This is the dwelling of the **Upper Saints of the Three Purities** [三清上圣]. Mentioning the **Great Luo Jade Purity** implies the **Upper Purity** and **Supreme Purity** within it are known.\"*\n\nThus, it is said: *\"Ascending to **Yujing**.\"*\n\nNext, it states: *\"**Zhuangzi**, beating his basin to send off his wife, then entered to serve the **Celestial Sovereign**.\"* The *Southern Flower Scripture* *Chapter on Perfect Joy* [《至乐篇》] says:\n*\"When **Zhuangzi’s** wife died, **Huizi** condoled him. **Zhuangzi** sat cross-legged, feet stretched out arrogantly, sawing wood with a song. **Huizi** said: ‘Living with someone, growing old together, and then dying—even without weeping, that is enough. Yet you beat your basin and sing—is this not excessive?’ **Zhuangzi** replied: ‘Not so. At her death, how could I not mourn? But considering her origin—she was never born. Not only was she never born, but she had no form. Not only no form, but no **qi**. She mingled with the indistinct and the indistinct, transforming into **qi**, **qi** transforming into form, form transforming into life. Now she transforms again into death—this is the cycle of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. People lie still in the great hall, taking Heaven and Earth as their dwelling. Yet I, clattering and wailing in pursuit of her, deemed myself unaligned with **Heaven’s Command** [命], so I stopped.’\"*\n\nIt also says: *\"Entering to serve the **Celestial Sovereign**.\"* According to the *New Record of the Dan Platform* [《丹台新录》]:\n*\"**Zhuangzi** ascended as **Grand Master of the Great Mystery** [太玄博士], a position of immortality.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the *Bìxū Sequence* states:\n\n*\"Though Laozi and Zhuangzi had wives, children, and descendants, they ultimately became the grand masters of the **Dao** and the teachers of humanity and Heaven. This is because they mingled among the common folk while their minds wandered beyond worldly concerns, diligently practicing the **Dao** to its fullest extent. They sought to teach mortals that **long life** is a skill to be cultivated—not a matter of supernatural feats alone. Therefore, it is said that this is the **outer realm’s teaching**, bearing the purity of ancient virtue.\"*\n\n---\n**Moral Canon of the Dao: Commentary on Hidden Mysteries**\n*Volume Four of the *Cangshì Mùwēi* Closed Exegesis*\n*Volume Five of the *Cangshì Zuǎnwēi* Open Exegesis*\n*Compiled by the Elder of Great Dawn, Xue Zhìxuān*\n\n**Title:** Yet, across the dynasties, they were revered without ceasing. In the first year of *Tiānshòu* (695 CE), Emperor Gaozong posthumously conferred upon Laozi the title **Playen Emperor**. In the first year of *Guāngzhù* (684 CE), the Empress Dowager posthumously conferred upon Lady Yin the title **Primordial Empress**, thus making her the **Holy Ancestor of the Tang**.\n\n**Commentary:** This is the fifteenth chapter, which clarifies that the **Playen Emperor’s** boundless virtue endures eternally, and across the dynasties, he was revered without ceasing. Thus, the Tang honored him as the **Holy Ancestor**.\n\n**Title:** Those who were revered without ceasing across the dynasties—from the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Sui, down to the Tang and Song—each generation paid homage, each age venerated him, and the temples were continuously restored. Thus, the *Lóuguān* pavilions in the southern mountains of *Cháng’ān* were the former residence of the **True Person Yin**, where the **Playen One** transmitted the scriptures.\n\nDuring the reign of King Mu of Zhou, the temples were adorned, and those who sought seclusion were summoned. Du Chong and the **True Person Yin’s** younger brother, Yin Guǐ, were appointed to oversee the observatory, and seven Daoist priests were ordained—this has since seen eight periods of flourishing and eight of decline.\n\nThe *Tàiqīng* Office in *Bózhōu* was the place of the **Playen One’s** birth. Across the dynasties, it was honored with inscriptions, including the *Cài Yōng* stele, the *Biàn Shào* stele, and the *Xuē Dàohéng* stele of the Sui. The Tang-era steles are now corrupted and incomplete, and it is unclear who composed them. As Wang Xīyí once wrote:\n\n*\"The twin gates stand in ruins, lost to Tang custom,\nYet the broken steles still bear Han’s refined prose.\"*\n\nIn the Song, there was the *Zhāng Shāngyīng* stele—clear evidence of their perpetual veneration.\n\nIn *Fèngxiàng Fǔ*, *Qíshān*’s southern slope stands the *Qǐshèng* Palace, said to be the residence of **Wénwáng’s** son, **Xièyì**.\n\nIn *Píngyáng Fǔ*, *Fúshān Xiàn*’s *Tiānshèng* Observatory was where, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, the **Playen One** manifested in a green-muzzled white donkey.\n\nThen there is the *Qīngyáng* Palace in *Chéngdū*, the *Yùjú* Observatory in *Qínzhōu*, originally called the *Qǐlíng* Palace, as well as the *Tàixiāo* Palace, the *Wèndào* Palace on *Kōngtóng Shān*, the *Tiānjìng* Palace in *Chéngfǔ Xiàn*, and the *Shàngqīng* Palace on *Běidēng Shān*—manifestations and veneration without end, too numerous to enumerate.\n\nAs for the Tang’s honorific of **Holy Ancestor**, it was in the first year of *Tiānshòu* (695 CE), on the twenty-eighth day of the second month, in the year of the *Bingyín* (1957 in the sexagenary cycle), that the title **Playen Emperor** was posthumously bestowed upon the **Playen One**.\n\nAccording to the *Guāngshèngyì*, the four characters **Playen Emperor** are explained thus:\n\n*\"Playen\" refers to depth, subtlety, and also the **Dao** and Heaven. It speaks of the **Dao**’s supreme, ineffable mystery—its profound and subtle essence, hence the term **Playen**.*\n\n*\"Yuan\" means origin, root, and ancestor. The *Ēryǎ* states: \"Zhào, zǔ, yuán, tái, yāngluò, quán yú, shǐ\" (to begin, to found, to originate). It means the **Playen One** is the root of the **Dao** and the ancestor of all things. Whether in the world or beyond it, all laws stem from him—thus, he is called **Yuan**.*\n\n*\"Huáng\" means great, referring to the **Dao** itself. It is also said, \"The **Dao** is great, hence **Huáng**.\" The *Shàngshū Xù* states: \"The books of the Three Sovereigns are called *Sānfén*, meaning the great **Dao**.\" Thus, it is **Huáng**.*\n\n*\"Dì\" means Heaven. His virtue aligns with Heaven, second only to the **Dao**. It is also said, \"Great virtue is called **Dì**.\" The *Shū Xù* states: \"The books of the Five Emperors are called *Wǔdiǎn*, meaning the constant **Dao**.\" When both **Dao** and virtue are spoken of together, it is called **Huángdì**. It is also said, \"To follow the **Dao** and align with Heaven is to be **Huángdì**.\" Thus, it is the **Playen Emperor**.*\n\nIn the reign of Emperor Xuānzong, the titles **Holy Ancestor** were added, making it **Holy Ancestor Playen Emperor**.\n\nIn ancient times, kings did not dare call themselves emperors, and emperors did not dare call themselves sovereigns—hence the distinction between the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings. When Qin Shǐhuáng unified the world and extinguished the Zhou, he burned the records of past dynasties, rewrote history, and sought to establish a precedent. He took the title of the Three Sovereigns above and the Five Emperors below, combining them into **Huángdì**, declaring himself the first of his kind—thus, **First Emperor**.\n\nTherefore, the Tang, in honoring the **Playen One** as the **Holy Ancestor**, also issued a decree posthumously conferring the title **Holy Ancestor Playen Emperor**. The county of *Gǔyáng* was renamed *Zhēnyuán*, and the local Yin clan was granted a one-year tax exemption to honor their ancestral roots.\n\nIn the first year of *Guāngzhù* (684 CE), the Empress Dowager issued a decree posthumously conferring upon Lady Yin, the **Holy Mother**, the title **Primordial Empress**. To the north of the *Tàiqīng* Palace, one *lǐ* away, a palace was built, named *Dòngxiāo* Palace, with *Xiāntiān* Observatory to the left and *Guānglíng* Palace to the right. The central structure was the *Dòngxiāo* Palace, the **Holy Mother’s** former residence. Her burial mound and a surviving sandal were still present.\n\nIn the reign of Emperor Zhēnzōng of the Song, the **Playen One** was posthumously honored as **Playen Emperor of Supreme Primordial Virtue**.\n\nThe term **Playen** has already been explained. As for **Hùnyuán**, it speaks of the **Playen One** emerging before the chaos of *Hùntūn* and enduring at the dawn of countless *yàjié* (aeons). Thus, he is called **Hùnyuán**.",

      "translated_text": "The **Playen Emperor of Supreme Primordial Virtue** thus holds the title **\"Supreme Virtue\"**—for the **Playen One** always speaks of achieving success without claiming credit, enduring without dominating, and possessing no virtue that could be named, hence he is called **\"Supreme Virtue.\"**\n\nThe terms *Emperor* and *Playen* have already been explained earlier, thus the full title is **Playen Emperor of Supreme Primordial Virtue**. Moreover, the county of *Zhēn Yuán* was renamed *Wèi Zhēn*, which remains its present name. Hence, it is said that the posthumous honor bestowed upon Laozi as **Playen Emperor of Supreme Primordial Virtue** stems from this.\n\nThe title reads: *\"In ancient times, the Old Master composed two treatises, one called* **Dao** *and the other* **De***. Now it is known as the* **Laozi’s Dao De Jing***, likely because after Master Guan Yin received the teachings, he designated them with this title.\"*\n\nThe commentary states: *\"This is the sixteenth section, clarifying the origin of the term* **Jing** *(Scripture) *after the* **Holy Mother** *received these two treatises.\"*\n\nIndeed, the **Dao De Jing** originally consisted only of the two treatises on **Dao** and **De**, with no mention of *Jing* and no count of eighty-one chapters. The term **Jing** means \"constant\"—that is, the teachings of **Dao** and **De** are eternal principles that must be followed by all ages without alteration. Thus, knowing that the **Holy Mother** later revered these two treatises, they were elevated to the status of **Jing**. The term *Jing* in the title of this work is likewise applied after Master Guan Yin received the teachings.\n\nThis is akin to the Confucian Five Classics—*Yì* (Changes), *Shàngshū* (Book of Documents), *Máo Shī* (Odes), *Chūnqiū* (Spring and Autumn Annals), and *Lǐjì* (Record of Rites)—which initially bore only their original names. Later scholars, in their respect for the teachers and veneration of the texts, elevated them to the status of the Five Classics.\n\nAgain, the four masters—Zhuangzi, Liezi, Wenzi, and Kangcangzi—originally composed works simply titled *Zhuangzi*, *Liezi*, *Wenzi*, and *Kangcangzi*. During the reign of Emperor Xuánzōng of the Tang, who revered the **Playen Way** and honored Daoist teachings, their works were renamed as follows: *Zhuangzi* became the *Nánhuá Zhēnxīng Jing* (South Flower Scripture of True Mystery), *Liezi* became the *Chōngxū Zhìdé Zhēnxīng Jing* (Scripture of True Virtue and Supreme Mystery), *Wenzi* became the *Tōngxuán Zhēnxīng Jing* (Scripture of True Perfection), and *Kāngcāngzi* became the *Dònglíng Zhēnxīng Jing* (Scripture of True Mysterious Essence). This is of the same meaning.\n\nMoreover, our **Playen Old Master** expounds the roots of **Dao** and **De**, serving as the progenitor of all teachings. Later scholars, in their reverence, elevate these works to the status of **Jing**. Is this not entirely appropriate?\n\nMaster Heshang further divided the **Upper** and **Lower Jing** into eighty-one chapters.\n\nThe title states: *\"**Dao** is indeed profound and difficult to speak of. There exists a formless substance, hence it is named* **Dao** *with force. Since it permeates all things, it is called* **Tōng** *(Permeating). Again,* **Dao** *is also* **Dào** *(to tread). As for the* **Dao** *of paths and roads, it is something that people revere and follow in practice. Hence,* **Dao** *is the awe-inspiring aspect of* **De** *(Virtue). Where there is* **Dao**, *there must be* **De**. *And* **De** *is* **Dé** *(to obtain). Obtaining within the heart and without in things, it is something that cannot be lost, hence all things obtain life through it—this is* **De***. Where there is* **De**, *there must be complete* **Dao**. *Since* **Dao** *and* **De** *are mutually dependent yet inseparable, they are called* **Dao De** *together.\"*\n\nThe commentary states: *\"This is the seventeenth section, which elucidates the meaning of* **Dao De** *and its explanations.\"*\n\nThe title further states: *\"**Dao** is indeed profound and difficult to speak of. There exists a formless substance, hence it is named* **Dao** *with force.\"* The profound and mysterious meaning is explained thus: **Dao** has no form, no shadow, no color, no sound. It cannot be distinguished by the divine mouth, being too profound and mysterious to be articulated. Hence, Zhuangzi says: *\"**Dao** is indeed profound and difficult to speak of,\"* which is already detailed in the first chapter of this **Jing**.\n\nAgain, this **Jing** states: *\"**Dao** is the profound mystery of all things.\"* And the *Dù Rén Jing* (Scripture of Transforming People) states: *\"This is called the profound mystery that is difficult to seek.\"* This is also akin to Mencius’ teaching of nurturing the *Hàorán* **Qi** (the expansive and boundless **Qi**), which he calls difficult to speak of. Zhuangzi also says: *\"**Dao** cannot be spoken of; if spoken of, it is not accurate.\"* This is the same meaning.\n\nHence, it is said that **Dao** is indeed profound and difficult to speak of.\n\nAgain, the title states: *\"There exists a formless substance, hence it is named* **Dao** *with force.\"* This is the text from the twenty-fifth chapter of this **Jing**, which has already been explained in this section and will not be repeated.\n\nAgain, the title states: *\"**Dao** is also* **Tōng** *(Permeating), since it permeates all things.\"* Hence, it is called *Tōng* (Permeating).\n\nAgain, it says: *\"**Dao** is also* **Dào** *(to tread).\"* As for the **Dao** of paths and roads, it is something that people revere and follow in practice. Another explanation states: **Dao** is guidance. Guidance means to lead. It refers to guiding the lost to enlightenment and leading the ordinary to the sacred.\n\nThe *Zìrán Jing* (Scripture of Nature) states: *\"This is the guidance of the end back to the origin.\"* The origin is true nature, and the end is false emotions. Hence, **Dao** is the guidance of false emotions back to true nature. Therefore, it is said that **Dao** is guidance.\n\nZhuangzi’s *Gēngsāng Pǔ* (Chapter of Geng Sang Pu) states: *\"**Dao** is the awe-inspiring aspect of* **De** *(Virtue).\"* Awe-inspiring means reverence. It states that what can be revered in **De** is **Dao**.\n\nThe title states: *\"Where there is* **Dao**, *there must be* **De***.\"* **De** is obtaining. Obtaining **Dao** within oneself and applying it to all things, it is something that cannot be lost. All things obtain life through it—this is **De**.\n\nThe general principle is that all things must first rely on **Dao Qi** (the **Qi** of **Dao**) to exist, then nurtured and sustained by **De**. Hence, the **Jing** states: *\"**Dao** gives birth to it;* **De** *nourishes it.\"* This is the case.\n\nAnother explanation states: **De** is completion. It is the means by which all beings are guided to attain the fruit of the boundless **Dao**. Hence, it is called **De**.\n\nThe title states: *\"Where there is* **De**, *there must be complete* **Dao***. Since* **Dao** *and* **De** *are mutually dependent yet inseparable, they are called* **Dao De** *together.\"*\n\n**Dao** is the essence of **De**, and **De** is the manifestation of **Dao**. The essence establishes the foundation, and the manifestation clarifies the essence. This is like the roots and branches of plants and trees, where the roots and branches are the essence, and the flowers and fruits are the manifestation.\n\nThus, it is known that flowers and fruits all arise from the roots and branches. If there were no roots and branches, then how could flowers and fruits emerge?",

Two yet not two, because of one; one yet not one, because of two. It cannot be said there is a body without body, nor can it be said there is function without function. Rather, it is that which has no body is the body, the body without body; that which has no function is the function, the function without function.\n\nTo seek its essence: beyond emptiness and being, neither yin nor yang, unseen by sight or hearing, untouchable and indistinguishable.\n\nTo seek its function: capable of both expedient and reality, adaptable to left or right, containing the small within the great, the great within the small.\n\nIts essence is boundless, its function inexhaustible—thus, the meaning of **Dao De**’s essence and function is indeed beyond thought and discussion.\n\nOnly when one transcends essence and function, discards both existence and nonexistence, does one reach this truth.\n\nThus, the title states: *\"Where there is* **De**, *there must be complete* **Dao***. Since* **Dao** *and* **De** *are mutually dependent yet inseparable, they are called* **Dao De** *together.\"*\n\nHence, Sima Qian said:\n\n*\"Those who follow the yin-yang school are excessive and cause confusion; those who follow Confucianism are broad but prone to overthinking; those who follow Mohism are harsh and harm nature; those who pursue fame are superficial and lack substance; those who uphold legalism are cruel and unkind. Only the teachings of Laozi are called the Great **Dao**—\n\nClear and empty, taking no action, yet concentrating the spirit,\nMoving in harmony with the formless, suffusing all things.\n\nIts methods adapt to changing times, responding to transformations in all things, fitting every circumstance.\n\nIts principles are concise yet easy to practice, its actions few yet its results great.\nIts practice is simple, its words easy to understand—\nRooted in emptiness and nonexistence, employing natural progression as its function.\n\nWithout fixed form or constant shape, it thus thoroughly understands the nature of all things.\n\nNeither leading nor following things, it thus becomes the sovereign of all things.\n\nTherefore, it precedes the Yellow Old [classics] and follows the Six Classics, uniquely praising Daoism for its purity and reverence.\n\nThus, it is said: The vastness of the Nine Classics does not compare to the brevity of the Two Chapters [of the *Dao De Jing*].\"*\n\nThe title states:\n\n*\"Jing* [Classic] refers to what is constant and what is law—\nSpeaking of principles that are constant and can be emulated, as in the meaning of the Nine Classics being something to emulate.\n\nAgain, *jing* is the honored term for scripture.\nNow, the *Dao Jing* [Classic of the **Dao**] is above, the *De Jing* [Classic of **De**] below—\nThe first line of the upper chapter takes its title from *‘The **Dao** that can be spoken of is not the eternal **Dao**,’*\nThe first line of the lower chapter takes its title from *‘Highest **De** is without **De**, thus it is called **De**.’*\nLater commentators, therefore, follow the text to generate meaning.\n\nSpeaking of **Dao** without **De**, it cannot be revealed.\nSpeaking of **De** without **Dao**, it cannot be clarified.\nThe **Dao** is without action and form, thus it precedes the transformation of things.\n**De** has function and action, thus it follows the generation of things.\nThe **Dao** precedes, hence it is placed above.\n**De** follows, hence it is placed below.\n\nAgain, when the **Dao** declines, **De** arises; when **De** declines, the Five Constants emerge—\nThis makes clear that **Dao De** is the foundation of all practices and the source of the Five Constants.\n\nThus, the *Dao Jing* comes first, the *De Jing* follows.\nThe two volumes together symbolize the generation of the two principles [yin-yang],\nAnd the eighty-one chapters represent the extreme number of the sun.\n\nTherefore, the upper chapter elucidates the **Dao** by emulating Heaven,\nThe lower chapter elucidates **De** by emulating Earth—\nHeaven’s number is odd, hence the upper chapter has thirty-seven sections.\nEarth’s number is even, hence the lower chapter has forty-four sections.\n\nThus, it begins with ancient sages and continues the ancient tradition.\n\nThe commentary states:\n*This is the eighteenth gate, properly clarifying the meaning of the term ‘jing’ and the intent behind the eighty-one chapters of the upper and lower classics.*\n\nWithin this gate, there are two divisions:\nThe first properly clarifies the meaning of the term ‘jing.’\nThe second elucidates the intent behind the eighty-one chapters of the upper and lower classics.\n\nFirst, properly clarifying the meaning of the term ‘jing’:\nThe title states: *\"Jing* refers to what is constant and what is law—\nSpeaking of principles that are constant and can be emulated, as in the meaning of the Nine Classics being something to emulate.\n\nAgain, *jing* is the honored term for scripture.\nAccording to the explanations in the *Guang Sheng Yi*, the term *jing* has four conventional interpretations:\nOne, *‘by’*—meaning the Three Worlds’ Celestial Sovereigns and the ten-directional saints all attain enlightenment and true reality through the teachings of the *jing*.\nTwo, *‘path’*—meaning it opens and communicates principles, guiding sentient beings as a bridge for scholars and a path to true reality.\nThree, *‘law’*—meaning it reveals profound truths and subtle principles, serving as a model for all beings and a standard for all saints.\nFour, *‘constant’*—meaning its profound principles are distant and silent, a timeless standard for all ages and rulers.\n\nPossessing these four meanings, it is collectively called *jing*.\nSometimes, it is formed by condensed *qi* and written in cloud-like script, with characters a *zhang* [ten feet] wide, eight-cornered with drooping rays.\nSometimes, it is inscribed in jade letters or jade plates, with dragon-script and phoenix-bindings, descending at the beginning of a kalpa and returning to Heaven at its end.\nSometimes, it is engraved on jade or gold, written on bamboo, wood, silk, or paper, transmitted and transformed across time, with seals and clerical scripts adapting to the era.\n\nThough their marvels differ, all are sacred and true secrets—\nExcellent remedies for healing ailments, wondrous gates to transcendence.\n\nEven if ages change and metals decay into stone, our *Dao De Jing* [True Classic of **Dao De**] remains in the world, eternally benefiting humans and celestial beings, enduring for countless kalpas as the supreme path for self-cultivation and governance, the standard for attaining fruit and true reality.\n\nThus, it is called *jing*.\"",

      "translated_text": "The second part elucidates the essence of the **Upper Dao Classic** and **Lower De Classic**, as well as the eighty-one chapters.\n\nIt is titled *The Dao Classic* above and *The De Classic* below—so it is said—originating from ancient sages, yet still following the old traditions. The title is already clear, and no further explanation is needed.\n\nAgain, observing the preface of the Tang Emperor Minghuang, it states: Though the **Classic** is divided into two parts, the **Dao** is first and **De** follows, yet the names of *body* (体 *tǐ*) and *function* (用 *yòng*) may be scattered, but their essence cannot be scattered. The true and solid essence is called *body*—that is, the **Mysterious Body**. The adaptable and responsive function is called *function*—that is, the **Mysterious Function**. Hence, the **Classic** speaks of *same origin, different names*, and *same essence, called Mysterious*. When speaking of their origin, they are divided into two; when speaking of their unity, they merge into one. Thus, it is said: *Names may be scattered, but essence cannot be scattered*.\n\nTherefore, the **Upper Dao Classic** says: *\"This is called Mysterious Virtue\"* (是谓玄德 *shì wèi xuán dé*).\nAgain: *\"The form of boundless virtue\"* (孔德之容 *kǒng dé zhī róng*).\nAgain: *\"Virtue is in accord with the Way\"* (德者同於道 *dé zhě tóng yú dào*).\nAgain: *\"The abiding virtue never departs\"* (常德不离 *cháng dé bù lí*).\nHence, it is said: *The Way relies on virtue*.\n\nThe **Lower De Classic** says: *\"Only after losing the Way do we speak of virtue\"* (失道而后德 *shī dào ér hòu dé*).\nAgain: *\"Reversion is the movement of the Way\"* (反者道之动 *fǎn zhě dào zhī dòng*).\nAgain: *\"The Way generates unity\"* (道生一 *dào shēng yī*).\nAgain: *\"The Great Way is most smooth\"* (大道甚夷 *dà dào shèn yí*).\nHence, it is said: *Virtue originates from the Way*.\n\nThus, the **Classic** presents *body* and *function* in alternating exposition, revealing the core essence without rigidly distinguishing them by their titles.\n\nIt is titled: *This Classic takes **Double Mysterious** as its core, **Nature** as its body, and **Dao De** as its function*. Its essence lies in governing the self and the realm. To govern the realm, one must *do nothing while the people transform themselves*, and *desire nothing while the people return to simplicity*. To govern the self, one must *chill the **Jue** [mouth/joy] and close the **Men** [gates]*, so that the *Spirit of the Grain* (谷神 *gǔ shén*) does not perish, and *private desires are few while cravings are scarce*. These are its core principles, which may be spoken of.\n\nBut the **Mysterious** that is *seen but not seen, heard but not heard*—the **Mysterious** beyond the **Mysterious**, the **Gate of All Marvels**—is perhaps beyond what can be spoken or transmitted. Those who wander its halls and courtyards claim to have ascended the hall and glimpsed its depths, but only when they delve deeply and ponder with precision do they, in the Dao, know its *fine tip of an autumn hair* (秋毫之端 *qiū háo zhī duān*), yet still grasp but a fraction of its whole. The preface says: *This is the nineteenth gate, revealing the core principles of the **Dao** and **De** Classics, the great essence of governing the realm and the self, left for later generations to inherit*. Within this gate, there are two further divisions. The first elucidates the core principles of **Dao De**. The second reveals the great essence of governing the realm and the self.\n\nThe first, which elucidates the core principles of **Dao De**, is titled: *This Classic takes **Double Mysterious** as its core, **Nature** as its body, and **Dao De** as its function*. **Double Mysterious** as the core is evidenced by the **Classic**’s words: *\"All called Mysterious\"* (同谓之玄 *tóng wèi zhī xuán*), *\"the **Mysterious** beyond the **Mysterious**, the **Gate of All Marvels**\"* (玄之又玄，众妙之门 *xuán zhī yòu xuán, zhòng miào zhī mén*). Again: *\"Reduce it again, reduce it again, until reaching **Do-Nothing***\"* (损之又损，以至於无为 *sǔn zhī yòu sǔn, yǐ zhì yú wúwéi*). **Nature** as the *body* is evidenced by the **Classic**’s words: *\"All the people say I am **Nature**\"* (百姓皆谓我自然 *bǎi xiànng jiē wèi wǒ zìrán*). Again: *\"Humans follow Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Way, the Way follows **Nature**\"* (人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然 *rén fǎ dì, dì fǎ tiān, tiān fǎ dào, dào fǎ zìrán*). **Dao De** as the *function* is evidenced by the **Classic**’s words: *\"The Way is **Surging** yet its **Function** is applied\"* (道冲而用之 *dào chōng ér yòng zhī*). Again: *\"Reversion is the movement of the Way\"* (反者道之动 *fǎn zhě dào zhī dòng*), *\"The yielding is the **Way’s** withdrawal\"* (弱者道之甩 *ruò zhě dào zhī shuǎi*). Again: *\"Great fullness seems **Surging**—its **Function** is inexhaustible\"* (大盈若冲，其用不穷 *dà yíng ruò chōng, qí yòng bù qióng). These are its great principles.\n\nThe meanings of each phrase are individually clarified in their respective chapters, and I shall not repeat them here.\n\nThe *Guangsheng Yi* [Comprehensive Sacred Meaning] says: *The core and its tendency are unified*—that is, this **True Classic of Dao De** encompasses all meanings, pointing to their intent and purpose, each with its own masterful principle. Moreover, the scholars such as **He Shang Gong** [Riverbank Master], **Yan Junping** [Sage of Strictness], all expounded on the **Way** of governing the realm. The **Songling Immortal**, **Sun Deng** of the Wei Dynasty, **Tao Yuanming** [Hidden Residence Sage] of the Liang Dynasty, **Gu Huan** of the Southern Qi, all expounded on the **Way** of governing the self. The monks **Luo Shi** in the time of **Fu Jian**, **Futuo Cheng** in the time of the **Hou Zhao**, and **Duo Lue** in the reign of **Liang Wu Emperor**, all expounded on the **Way** of matters, principles, and cause-and-effect. The Daoists **Meng Zhizhou**, **Zang Xuanjing**, **Zhu Lian** of the Chen Dynasty, **Liu Jinxi** of the Sui Dynasty, **Cheng Xuaneng**, **Cai Zihuang**, **Huang Xuan’ao**, **Li Rong**, **Che Xuanbi**, **Zhang Huichao**, and **Li Yuanxing** of the Tang Dynasty, all expounded on the **Way** of **Double Mysterious**. **He Yan**, **Zhong Hui**, **Du Yuankai**, **Wang Fusi**, **Yang Fu**, **Lu Shi**, and **Liu Renhui**, all expounded on the **Way** of **Do-Nothing** and **Void Extremity** for governing the family and the realm.\n\nThese scholars, in their interpretations and expositions, each have their own distinct tendencies. Moreover, each school’s reception of learning and establishment of doctrine also differs. **Yan Junping** took *Mysterious and Void* as his core. **Gu Huan** took *Do-Nothing* as his core. **Meng Zhizhou** and **Zang Xuanjing** took *Dao De* as their core. **Liang Wu Emperor** took *Neither Existence nor Non-Existence* as his core. **Sun Deng** took **Double Mysterious** as his core. Among these doctrines, **Sun Deng’s** is the most profound.\n\nThe **True Person of Azure Emptiness** [Laozi], who compiled these subtle teachings, also took **Double Mysterious** as his core, **Nature** as his *body*, and **Dao De** as his *function*. When practiced in the realm, it leads to *Do-Nothing and no affairs*, naturally attaining **Great Peace**. When practiced in the family, it brings *harmony among the six relations*, and *no calamities intrude*. When practiced in the self, it means *embracing unity and guarding the center*, naturally ascending to the **Way’s** fruition. Those who attain it *soar through the void and tread upon the luminous*, gazing long and living forever. Those who lose it suffer *calamity upon the self and the family*, with *shortened lifespan and hastened death*. It depends on the **Upper Sage** [superior person] who is diligent, guarding and embracing it, always as the standard model.\n\nThe second part, which reveals the great essence of governing the realm and the self—titled *Its essence lies in governing the self and the realm*—concerns the *fine tip of an autumn hair* that is but a fraction of the whole. The above titles are all verified by this **Classic** itself, with their meanings clarified in the respective chapters below. I shall not repeat them here.\n\nFurthermore, according to the *Tang **Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary**’s preface*, it states: *The **Dao** and **De** Classics, their essence lies in governing the self and the realm*. To govern the realm is to *abolish arrogance and discard ornamentation*, practicing *Do-Nothing and saying nothing* as the teaching. To govern the self is to *manifest simplicity and embrace purity*, with *few private desires and scarce cravings*, striving for *a void heart and a substance-filled belly*.",
