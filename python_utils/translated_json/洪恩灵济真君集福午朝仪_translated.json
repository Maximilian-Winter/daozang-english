deign to look upon us with penetrating insight.\n\nWe have heard that the Crimson Qi of the Cavernous Yang\nShines forth with radiant brilliance in the numinous chart.\n\nThe vermilion clouds of the cinnabar firmament\nCast their shade, beheld in awe beneath the feathered canopy.\nThe profound mysteries are deeply glimpsed within the treasury of wonders,\nThe Perfect Real is solemnly witnessed in its radiant advent.\n\nWe yearn for the Yang’s brilliance to merge with spring’s warmth,\nAs the vermilion terrace grows misty and mild;\nFollowing courtly rites to greet the day,\nThe Purple Pole’s winds blow pure and clear.\n\nMoved by the workings of Creation’s mechanism,\nThe teachings of the Immortals and Perfected flow forth.\nAuspicious hues intertwine beyond the sun,\nResonant tones of jade echo through the cloud-layers.\n\nWith earnest devotion we expound the teachings,\nWith steadfast resolve we offer praise—\nGazing as though You were present,\nYour descending insight is not distant.\n\nWith sincere and wholehearted devotion,\nWe have now made our supplication,\nFollowing the purport of these words,\nWith utmost reverence and sincerity.\n\nWe aspire to repay Your grace with doubled veneration,\nAnd to extend blessings for the realm’s enduring felicity.\nThe ranks of egrets hasten in orderly array,\nThe distant chime of the day’s clepsydra is heard;\nFragrant warmth rises from the dragon-carved censer,\nAs the hallowed breeze and luminous air revolve.\n\nMay the Perfected and Sacred One deign to accept our offering,\nUniting the hidden and manifest in mutual trust.\n\nToday, at the noon audience,\nWe ascend the altar and perform the Dao,\nThe assembly of ritualists,\nNow kindles the first pinch of incense, chanting:\nThe incense reaches the Lingji Palace,\nSpreading through the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates to form a canopy of splendor,\nOffered to the Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates.\n\nMay this fragrant smoke\nBe offered to the Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates,\nAnd to the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace.\n\nWe, Your servants, take refuge in the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace,\nAnd dedicate the merit of this pinch of incense,\nReverently to the Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates,\nThe Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates,\nAnd the Nine Heavenly Ranks of the Five Marchmounts’ Treasuries of Numinosity.\n\nThe literary compositions unfurl like brocade,\nResplendent as the stars’ trailing radiance;\nThe grace of rain and dew, the light of favor,\nWondrously turn the pivot of the celestial mechanism.\n\nAssisting and upholding the Imperial Pole,\nMoistening and nourishing all living beings.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense,\nFrom our refuge in the virtue of the Perfected Lord, the Great Sage Host, and the Most True,\nThat after attaining the Dao, they may long preserve Heaven’s enduring existence,\n*In harmony: With the Dao they unite as true.*\n\nAt the daylight watch, proclamations resound,\nThe Celestial Countenance bears joy;\nMeasuring the lodged intent with reverent service,\nThrough morning audience we extend our prayers.\n\nOn this noon audience, ascending the altar to perform the Dao,\nWe beseech the dharma assembly:\nOffering this second pinch of incense,\n*In harmony: The incense reaches the Lingji Palace, suffusing the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates as a canopy of treasures, to honor the Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates.*\n\nMay the smoke of this incense honor\nThe Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates,\nAnd the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace.\n\nWe, Your servants, take refuge in the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace,\nAnd dedicate the merit of this pinch of incense,\nReverently to the August Emperor, our Lord,\nHumbly wishing His Majesty’s exalted throne endure,\nEver sheltering the realm.\n\nMay earth endure and Heaven last,\nAscending to ten thousand years of sagely longevity;\nMay the sea embrace and spring nurture,\nAwakening the joy of all people.\n\nMay the frontiers know no dust of war,\nAnd the fields yield their plowing and weaving;\nMay loyal ministers illumine the court,\nAnd the seas and lands attain pure tranquility.\nMay these auspicious signs herald the flourishing of perfect governance,\nAnd the long unfolding of Great Peace’s propitious destiny.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense,\nFrom our refuge in the virtue of the Perfected Lord, the Great Sage Host, and the Most True,\nThat after attaining the Dao, they may forever preserve long life,\n*In harmony: With the Dao they unite as true.*\n\nTen thousand sages share one radiance,\nA single light universally bestowed;\nThe sun of kindness broadly opens in the cinnabar realm,\nThe light of compassion is reverently beheld in the numinous palace.\n\nOn this noon audience, ascending the altar to perform the Dao,\nWe beseech the dharma assembly:\nOffering this third pinch of incense,\n*In harmony: The incense reaches the Lingji Palace, suffusing the Nine Heavens’ palaces and gates as a canopy of clouds, to honor the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace.*\n\nMay the smoke of this incense honor\nThe Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates,\nThe Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates,\nAnd the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace.\n\nWe, Your servants, take refuge in the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace,\nAnd dedicate the merit of this pinch of incense,\nTo the Crown Prince, the imperial princes, the pillars of state,\nThe ministers and officials, the people of the realm,\nAnd all beings within the world.\n\nHumbly we pray:\nMay the Three Virtues flourish and abound,\nHarmoniously aiding the myriad affairs of governance.\nMay brilliance and clarity increase,\nAnd sagely learning daily renew in virtue and enterprise.\nMay body and mind embody trust and compliance,\nAnd cultivation and governance perfectly accord with Heaven’s intent.\nMay a hundred blessings gather in abundance,\nAnd a thousand auspicious signs converge.\n\nMay anxieties yet unmanifest forever cease,\nAnd joys yet to come arrive in profusion.\nMay they ascend to the felicity of benevolence and longevity,\nAnd flourish in the blessings of harmony and peace.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense,\nFrom our refuge in the virtue of the Perfected Lord, the Great Sage Host, and the Most True,\nThat after attaining the Dao, they may forever preserve long life,\n*In harmony: With the Dao they unite as true.*\n\n*Chanting the directions, repenting the directions.*\n\nFirst, second invocations—threefold prostrations.\nReverently re-declaring the sacred ranks, we, your subjects in attendance, together with the officiating officials and assembly, humbly and earnestly re-present this supplication to the august thrones.\n\nWe have heard that the Great Potter’s wheel scatters all things, universally infusing the qi of life in ceaseless flow. Utmost sincerity moves the numinous, and we aspire that our earnest hearts may ascend to meet them. Now, as the sun rides the zenith of equinox, we solemnly array our ranks to attend the celestial court above. The nine-hued radiance of the image abides, and the ten directions inter-reflect in splendor. The eight phoenixes’ chant resounds in response, and the myriad norms unfold in full.\n\nWe, your servants, reverently receive the imperial mandate to offer repayment through devotion, and serve the jiao rites with utmost reverence. The offerings of milfoil and pondweed embody the gravity of ritual intent, and the sacrificial feast is not distant; the incense and flowers resplendently adorn the altar’s solemnity, and our responsive praise is but scrupulous. Our gaze ascends to the jade steps, our ranks arrayed upon the jeweled terraces.\n\nYet through ten thousand kalpas of ignorance, the karmic conditions remain unwashed; though we toil at the Three Vehicles’ truths, our devotion to the Dao is in vain. First, we beseech the mercy of lenient pardon, that we may exhaust the utmost of our earnest entreaty.\n\nAbove, we pray that the imperial domain expand in grandeur, and the precious throne stand secure in majesty. May the ancestral altars endure for ten thousand years, and the chariots and written scripts of the four seas last forever. May the heir apparent’s virtue of cultured refinement flourish, brilliantly aiding the myriad affairs; may the imperial kinsmen and feudatories together share the diligence of joint assistance, extending auspiciousness through a hundred generations.\n\nFurther, we hope that the Five Phases follow their proper sequence, and the Six Qi harmoniously converge; that all people embody the compassion of universal love, and all beings fulfill the nature of their creation. May the teachings shine forth in brilliance, and the transformative power of the Dao flourish in action. May every sentient being together realize the omniscience of enlightenment.\n\nThus may the luminous transformation of the Perfected Lord’s great compassion be fulfilled above, and the sincerity of our refuge and devotion be answered below.\n\nRespectfully presented for your hearing.\n\nTwelve Vows—\nAbiding in spirit, we burn incense.\n\nMay the Fragrant Official Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant Fragrant Spirits and Divine Officers hereby cause the site where I, your servant, ascended the altar at the noon audience to perform the Daoist rites to naturally generate golden liquid elixirs, azure mushroom blossoms, and jade stalks of immortality. May the hundred numinous spirits and assembled perfected beings gather here before this incense burner. May our utmost sincerity be felt and responded to, bringing blessings and prosperity in abundance; may the divine ever grant their support, and may both family and state together attain purity and tranquility.\n\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid-scented smoke, conveying the words I have just uttered swiftly to the presence of the Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Golden Portal of the Nine Heavens and the Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens.\n\n*Exiting the Hall Chant*\n*Stepping Forth from the Chamber*\n\nThe Noon Rite of the Vast Grace Numinous Aid Perfected Lord for Gathering Blessings is now complete.",

Utmost sincerity moves the numinous, and we aspire that our earnest hearts may ascend to meet them. Now, as the sun rides the zenith of equinox, we solemnly array our ranks to attend the celestial court above. The nine-hued radiance of the image abides, and the ten directions inter-reflect in splendor. The eight phoenixes’ chant resounds in response, and the myriad norms unfold in full.\n\nWe, your servants, reverently receive the imperial mandate to offer repayment through devotion, and serve the jiao rites with utmost reverence. The offerings of milfoil and pondweed embody the gravity of ritual intent, and the sacrificial feast is not distant; the incense and flowers resplendently adorn the altar’s solemnity, and our responsive praise is but scrupulous. Our gaze ascends to the jade steps, our ranks arrayed upon the jeweled terraces.\n\nYet through ten thousand kalpas of ignorance, the karmic conditions remain unwashed; though we toil at the Three Vehicles’ truths, our devotion to the Dao is in vain. First, we beseech the mercy of lenient pardon, that we may exhaust the utmost of our earnest entreaty.\n\nAbove, we pray that the imperial domain expand in grandeur, and the precious throne stand secure in majesty. May the ancestral altars endure for ten thousand years, and the chariots and written scripts of the four seas last forever. May the heir apparent’s virtue of cultured refinement flourish, brilliantly aiding the myriad affairs; may the imperial kinsmen and feudatories together share the diligence of joint assistance, extending auspiciousness through a hundred generations.\n\nFurther, we hope that the Five Phases follow their proper sequence, and the Six Qi harmoniously converge; that all people embody the compassion of universal love, and all beings fulfill the nature of their creation. May the teachings shine forth in brilliance, and the transformative power of the Dao flourish in action. May every sentient being together realize the omniscience of enlightenment.\n\nThus may the luminous transformation of the Perfected Lord’s great compassion be fulfilled above, and the sincerity of our refuge and devotion be answered below.\n\nRespectfully presented for your hearing.\n\nTwelve Vows—\nAbiding in spirit, we burn incense.",
