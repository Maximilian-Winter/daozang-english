  "full_translation": "*The Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection*\n*Title: The Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection*\n*Sixty scrolls, unattributed, likely dating to the Yuan dynasty.*\n*Source text: \"Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era,\" Dongzhen Section, Methods Category.*\n\n*Scroll Fourteen of The Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection: The Transmission of the Dao from Zhong-Lü*\n*Recorded by Pure Yang Perfected Immortal Zhongli Quan (Yunfang), Enlightening Pure Yang Perfected Immortal Lü (Dongbin) of Mount Yanxia, Transmitted by Hua Yang Perfected Immortal Shi Jianwu (Xisheng)*\n\n**On True Immortals**\n\nLü said: When a person is born, how can one live without illness, remain vigorous without aging, and exist without dying? By what Dao can this be achieved?\n\nZhong said: Human life begins when father and mother unite, and the two qi converge, forming essence and blood into the fetal sac. After the Great Beginning, there arises the Great Substance. Yin receives and Yang generates; qi follows the transformation of the fetus. After three hundred days, the form is complete, and the numinous light enters the body, separating from the mother. After the Great Simplicity, there is already ascent and descent. The yellow sprout grows, and after five thousand days, the qi reaches its full measure—eighty-one zhang in total—only then, at the age of fifteen, is one called a \"youthful boy.\" At this time, Yin is half within Yang, comparable to the light of the setting sun. Beyond this, one loses primordial Yang, dissipates true qi, and when qi weakens, illness, death, and extinction follow. Through a lifetime of ignorance, one harms one’s own numinous light, lives a life of misfortune and stubbornness, and dimly exhausts one’s allotted lifespan. Thus, in the next life, the body differs in rank, and lifespans vary in length. Having been born, one perishes; having perished, one is reborn, turning endlessly without awakening, life after life falling into degradation. One loses the body to other species, the spirit to different shells, and the root-nature of utmost truth no longer returns to humanity. Wandering the byways of the Dao, one is forever without liberation. If one encounters a true immortal or perfected being who dissolves one’s karmic retribution, sheds the skin and discards the shell, and regains a human body, one remains in a state of stupor, muteness, and ignorance. After accumulating merit for a hundred kalpas, one ascends to a blessed realm, yet still suffers hunger, cold, and lingering afflictions. Gradually advancing, one slowly regains a complete form, yet still dwells among slaves and servants in lowly stations. If one then commits further transgressions, it is like a ball rolling down a plank—one re-enters the byways of the wheel of rebirth.\n\nLü said: Born in the Middle Kingdom, fortunate to live in an age of peace, with clothing and food somewhat sufficient and time not yet too late—those who love are at ease, while those who resent fall ill; those who covet live, while those who fear die. Today, having met my revered teacher, I bow again and again, entreating you: considering that the matter of life and death is of utmost importance, might you deign to expound the principle of being without illness or death, and instruct this poor scholar?\n\nZhong said: If one wishes to avoid the turning wheel of rebirth and not enter the shells of other species, one should ensure that the body is free from the suffering of illness, aging, and death—standing between heaven and earth, embracing Yin and holding Yang, thus being human. As a human, one should not become a ghost; among humans, one cultivates to become an immortal; among immortals, one ascends to become celestial.\n\nLü said: When a person dies, they become a ghost; when the Dao is accomplished, one becomes an immortal. Immortals are of one kind—why then do you speak of ascending from immortals to become celestial?\n\nZhong said: Immortals are not of one kind. Those who are purely Yin without Yang are ghosts. Those who are purely Yang without Yin are immortals. Those in whom Yin and Yang are mixed are humans. Only humans can become ghosts or immortals. If in youth one does not cultivate but indulges the passions and follows the will, one falls ill and dies, becoming a ghost. If one awakens and cultivates, transcending the ordinary and entering sageliness, one sheds the mortal form and becomes an immortal. Immortals have five ranks, and the methods have three degrees of accomplishment. Cultivation depends on the individual, and the fruition of merit follows one’s allotted portion.\n\nLü said: You say the methods have three degrees of accomplishment, yet immortals have five ranks—why is this?\n\nZhong said: The methods have three degrees of accomplishment: small accomplishment, middle accomplishment, and great accomplishment—each different. Immortals have five ranks: ghost immortals, human immortals, earth immortals, spirit immortals, and celestial immortals—all are immortals, yet not equal. Ghost immortals do not depart from ghosts; human immortals do not depart from humans; earth immortals do not depart from earth; spirit immortals do not depart from spirits; celestial immortals do not depart from heaven.\n\nLü said: What is meant by a ghost immortal?\n\nZhong said: The ghost immortal is the lowest of the five immortals. One transcends within Yin, yet the spirit-image is unclear, the ghostly barrier has no surname, and the Three Mountains have no name. Though one does not enter the wheel of rebirth, one can scarcely return to Penglai or Yingzhou, and in the end, has no place to return—only to be reborn in a womb and take shelter in a dwelling. This is all.\n\nLü said: This being a ghost immortal, what methods and what practices lead to such a state?\n\nZhong said: Those who cultivate yet do not awaken to the great Dao from the outset, desiring quick success, become like withered wood, their hearts like dead ashes. Their spirit and consciousness are inwardly guarded, their will undivided and undispersed. From concentration, they emit a Yin spirit—this is a clear and numinous ghost, not a purely Yang immortal. Because their will is undivided, their Yin spirit does not scatter, hence they are called ghost immortals. Though called immortals, they are in truth ghosts. The followers of Buddhism who practice to this point claim to have attained the Dao—truly laughable!\n\nLü said: What is meant by a human immortal?\n\nZhong said: The human immortal is the second lowest of the five immortals. Those who cultivate the Dao yet do not awaken to the great Dao obtain one method within the Dao, one technique within that method, and hold to their faith and will without wavering for their entire lives. The qi of the Five Phases err in their convergence and union; the physical form is somewhat firm, and the eight perverse epidemics cannot harm them. They enjoy much peace and little illness—this is called a human immortal.\n\nLü said: What methods and what practices lead to this state of human immortality?\n\nZhong said: Those who cultivate may at first hear of the great Dao, but their karma is heavy and their fortune thin. All manner of demonic obstacles cause them to abandon their original resolve, and they stop at small accomplishments in the methods, unable to change or progress for their entire lives, unable to adapt to the four seasons. For example, those who cut off the five flavors—how would they know of the six qi? Those who forget the seven emotions—how would they know of the ten precepts?\n\nThose who practice rinsing and swallowing mistake it for exhalation and inhalation; those who cling to sexual arts deride purity and contention as folly. Those who delight in seizing qi from things rather than from heaven and earth refuse to abandon grain-eating; those who fix their minds to absorb the essence of sun and moon refuse to practice daoyin. Sitting alone in breath-holding—how would they know of spontaneity? Bending the body and toiling the form—how would they recognize non-action? Absorbing yin by taking a woman’s qi differs from contracting the Golden Turtle; nourishing yang by consuming a woman’s milk differs from refining the elixir. By analogy, such methods are countless, yet all belong to the Dao. Unable to embrace the great Dao in its entirety, they achieve mastery only in one method or one technique within it, attaining peace, longevity, and nothing more—hence they are called human immortals.\n\nThere is another class: those who delight in fleeting pleasures and grow weary of perseverance, who practice carelessly, mistime their efforts, and disorder their days. Instead of gaining longevity, they bring on illness—such cases abound in the world.\n\nLü said: What then is an earth immortal?\n\nZhong said: An earth immortal stands halfway between heaven and earth, possessing the talent of a divine immortal. Failing to awaken to the great Dao, they remain within the methods of minor attainment. Though their achievements are not outwardly visible, they attain long life and dwell in the world without dying among men.\n\nLü said: How does one begin the path to earth immortality?\n\nZhong said: First, one must grasp the principle of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, and the numbers of the sun and moon’s generation and completion. Within the body, one employs years and months; within the day, one employs hours and moments. First, one must recognize Dragon and Tiger; next, one must pair Kan and Li. One must distinguish the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source, and discern the earliness and lateness of qi’s seasons. Gathering the True One, observing the Two Modes, arraying the Three Powers, distinguishing the Four Images, differentiating the Five Movements, stabilizing the Six Qi, assembling the Seven Treasures, ordering the Eight Trigrams, and traversing the Nine Provinces. The Five Phases are inverted, qi is transmitted from mother to child, and fluids circulate between husband and wife. The Three Fields are reversed and refined into the elixir, which permanently anchors the Lower Field. Refining the form to dwell in the world, one attains long life without death, becoming an immortal of the earthly realm—hence called an earth immortal.\n\nLü said: What is a divine immortal?\n\nZhong said: A divine immortal, weary of dwelling in the dusty world, continues their practice without cease, linking the joints as one. Lead is drawn out and mercury added, refining the golden essence to the crown and returning the jade fluid as the elixir. The form is refined into qi, the Five Qi ascend to the origin, and the Three Yang gather at the crown. When merit is complete, the form is forgotten, and the fetal immortal transforms spontaneously. Yin is exhausted and yang is pure; a body appears outside the body. Shedding the mortal frame, one ascends as an immortal, transcends the ordinary, and enters sagehood. Leaving the dusty world behind, one returns to the Three Mountains—hence called a divine immortal.\n\nLü said: What is a heavenly immortal?\n\nZhong said: A heavenly immortal, weary of dwelling in the dusty realm, continues their practice without cease until they attain liberation—thus becoming a divine immortal. A divine immortal, weary of dwelling on the Three Isles, transmits the Dao among men. Above, they have merit; below, they have conduct. When merit and conduct are complete, they receive the celestial writ and return to the Grotto-Heavens—hence called a heavenly immortal. Once a heavenly immortal, if weary of dwelling in the Grotto-Heavens, they may take office as a celestial official: the lower are Water Officials, the middle are Earth Officials, and the upper are Heavenly Officials. Having rendered great service to heaven and earth, and great conduct in past and present, they are promoted through the ranks. After serving in the thirty-six Grotto-Heavens, they return to the eighty-one Yang Heavens; after serving in the eighty-one Yang Heavens, they return to the realm of the Three Pure Ones, the Spontaneous, and the Non-Being.\n\nLü said: Ghost immortals are surely beyond seeking, and heavenly immortals beyond daring to hope for. Might I hear of the methods for human, earthly, and divine immortals?\n\nZhong said: Human immortals do not transcend the methods of minor attainment; earthly immortals do not transcend the methods of middle attainment; divine immortals do not transcend the methods of great attainment. These three levels of attainment are, in truth, one. Using methods to seek the Dao is not difficult; using the Dao to seek immortality, immortality is easily attained.\n\nLü said: From ancient times to the present, those who cultivate life have not failed to seek longevity, nor to seek ascent as immortals. Yet why do they not attain longevity or ascend as immortals?\n\nZhong said: Their methods do not accord with the Dao. Relying on extensive learning and forced memorization, they create minor tests and pursue heterodox paths, inevitably falling into illness and death. Yet they still claim to have achieved liberation in death, misleading the world. They mutually praise one another, preventing the great Dao from being heard. Even those with sincere faith and苦志, who practice diligently for a long time, ultimately see no results and pass away with the seasons. Alas! To discourse on the great Dao...\n\nLü said: What then is this great Dao?\n\nZhong said: The great Dao is formless and nameless, unquestioned and unanswered. Vast beyond all bounds, minute beyond all measure—none can truly know it, none can truly practice it.\n\nLü said: From ancient times to the present, those who have attained mastery first study the Dao, then possess the Dao, then realize the Dao, and finally perfect the Dao. In this world, they enter Penglai Isle; they ascend to the Grotto Heavens, then to the Heaven of Yang, and finally to the Three Pure Realms—all are those who have perfected the Dao. Yet now, Master, you alone say the Dao cannot be known or practiced. Does this mean the Dao remains hidden from you?\n\nZhong said: I have certainly not concealed the Dao. Rather, those in the world who claim to follow it possess only the name of loving the Dao. Though they may hear of the great Dao, they lack faith; though they may have faith, they lack苦志. They change their course by evening from what they pursued at dawn, forget what they sat to do when they stand, begin with diligence but end in sloth. Thus I say the great Dao is difficult to know and difficult to practice.\n\nLü said: What is the principle behind the Dao being difficult to know and difficult to practice?\n\nZhong said: Because minor heterodox methods yield quick results, the common crowd readily transmits them to one another, persisting until death without awakening. This has become a corrupt custom that undermines the great Dao. Some practice fasting, some abstain from grain, some gather qi, some rinse and swallow saliva, some leave their wives, some forsake flavors, some meditate in dhyāna, some maintain silence, some engage in visualization, some cultivate yin, some ingest qi, some endure cold, some calm the mind, some sever worldly ties, some open the crown of the head, some contract the genitals, some withdraw from the world, some study texts, some refine elixirs, some regulate breath, some practice daoyin, some expel and absorb, some engage in sexual arts, some make offerings, some provide alms, some perform acts of salvation, some enter mountains, some discern their nature, some remain unmoving, some receive and uphold precepts. The minor heterodox methods are too numerous to recount.\n\nFor instance, some seek the essence of the sun and moon, seize the qi of heaven and earth, fix their thoughts and intentions, and hope to congeal cinnabar. They contort their bodies and exhaust their forms, desiring liberation. Restricting outflow while increasing intake may cure illness. Mistaking this for true fetal breathing or thoughtless silence may nurture the nature. Yet they point to it as the true qi of the Great One, the unyielding golden spear, the Yellow River flowing backward—mere inferior methods for nurturing life. Their bodies like withered wood, their minds like dead ashes—these are but minor arts of gathering spirit.\n\nAlas! From ancient times to the present, those who follow the Dao have painstakingly fixed their minds on such practices. They swallow saliva as medicine—how can they attain transformation? They amass qi as an elixir—how can it remain? They designate the liver as the dragon and the lungs as the tiger—how can they unite? They identify Kan as lead and Li as mercury—how can they refine and replenish? They irrigate in all seasons, hoping for the yellow sprout to grow. With single-minded focus, they seek the great medicine, yet they miscount years and months, waste days and hours. Unaware of the root of the Five Phases, how can they comprehend the transformations of the Three Powers?\n\nSeeking branches and plucking leaves, they mislead later generations, causing the great Dao to grow ever more distant and neglected. Heresies arise and become custom, losing the original intent of the ancient masters. This stems from hearsay and superficial learning, passing techniques to the ignorant, who in turn instruct others. Thus they pass through the seasons and descend to the Yellow Springs, a pitiful outcome.\n\nIt is not that I do not wish to expound the great Dao, but the world’s people bear heavy karma and meager fortune. They distrust the celestial mechanism, value wealth over life, and willingly become lowly ghosts.\n\nLü said: The minor heterodox methods are now clear. May I hear of the great Dao?\n\nZhong said: The Dao originally requires no question, and questions originally elicit no answer. Yet when the true origin divides, the great simplicity scatters. The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three. The One is essence, the Two is function, the Three is transformation. Essence and function arise from yin and yang; transformation results from their union. The Three Powers—Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—all derive from the One Dao. The Dao generates the Two Qi, the Two Qi generate the Three Powers, the Three Powers generate the Five Phases, and the Five Phases generate the myriad things. Among the myriad things, the most intelligent and noble is humanity.\n\nOnly humanity can fathom the principles of the myriad things, fully realize its own nature, and thereby master destiny. Preserving life and safeguarding destiny to unite with the Dao, one may attain the same enduring solidity as Heaven and Earth.\n\nLü said: Heaven and Earth endure forever, spanning millennia without end, while human life lasts a hundred years, and even seventy is rare. Why does the Dao reside in Heaven and Earth yet seem distant from humanity?\n\nZhong said: The Dao is not distant from humanity; humanity distances itself from the Dao. The reason it distances itself is that it nurtures life without knowing the method. The reason it does not know the method is that it practices without recognizing the timing. The reason it does not recognize timing is that it fails to grasp the mechanism of Heaven and Earth.\n\nLü said: May I hear of this mechanism of Heaven and Earth?\n\nZhong said: The mechanism of Heaven and Earth is the operation of the great Dao, through which they ceaselessly ascend and descend, enduring without end. They have never lightly revealed it to humanity.\n\nLü said: How does Heaven and Earth’s mechanism manifest in their operation of the Dao? How does it manifest in their practice? How does operation begin? How is practice perfected?\n\nZhong said: Once the great Dao divides, forms arise, and with forms come numbers. Heaven embodies the Dao of Qian, with the One as its essence, light and pure above, employing yang. Earth embodies the Dao of Kun, with the Two as its essence, heavy and turbid below, employing yin. Yang ascends and yin descends; their union is the function of Qian and Kun, never departing from the Dao.\n\nAnd its inception has its time, its fruition its day.\n\nLü said: Heaven embodies the Dao of Qian, employing yang, and yang governs ascent—how then does it unite with Earth? Earth embodies the Dao of Kun, employing yin, and yin governs descent—how then does it unite with Heaven? If Heaven and Earth do not unite, how can yin and yang converge? If yin and yang do not converge, how can Qian and Kun function? Without the function of Qian and Kun, though there be a time of inception and a day of fruition, how can the great Dao be attained?\n\nZhong said: The Dao of Heaven takes Qian as its essence and yang as its function, accumulating qi above. The Dao of Earth takes Kun as its essence and yin as its function, accumulating water below. Heaven practices the Dao by Qian seeking Kun: once sought, it becomes the eldest son, called Zhen; twice sought, the middle son, called Kan; thrice sought, the youngest son, called Gen. Thus does Heaven unite with Earth, and through Earth’s Dao seeking Kun’s Dao, the three yang are born. Then Earth practices the Dao by Kun seeking Qian: once sought, it becomes the eldest daughter, called Xun; twice sought, the middle daughter, called Li; thrice sought, the youngest daughter, called Dui. Thus does Earth unite with Heaven, and through Kun’s Dao seeking Qian’s Dao, the three yin are born. The three yang converge with the three yin, and the myriad things are born; the three yin converge with the three yang, and the myriad things are completed. The union of Heaven and Earth fundamentally arises from Qian and Kun seeking each other, thereby operating within the Dao. Qian and Kun seeking each other generate the six qi; the six qi converging divide into the five phases; the five phases converging give birth to and complete the myriad things. When the Dao of Qian descends, the three seekings conclude, and its yang ascends again, yang concealing yin within, returning above to Heaven. When the Dao of Kun ascends, the three seekings conclude, and its yin descends again, yin concealing yang within, returning below to Earth. Yang concealing yin—its yin does not dissipate, and is called true yin. When true yin reaches Heaven, it is born through yang, so when yin descends from Heaven, how can it be without yang? Yin concealing yang—its yang does not perish, and is called true yang. When true yang reaches Earth, it is activated through yin, so when yang ascends from Earth, how can it be without yin? Yang concealing yin—its yin does not dissipate, returning to Earth; yin concealing yang—its yang does not perish, returning to Heaven. Revolving and beginning anew, operating without cease, their union never departs from the Dao—thus do they endure and remain firm.\n\nLü said: The mechanism of Heaven and Earth, operating within the Dao to attain longevity, is the achievement of their function. Though humans possess intelligence and aspire to embrace the great Dao through tranquility—whether to attain peace and longevity, immortality, or transcendence and ascension—how do they activate and operate the great Dao, moving in accord with the celestial mechanism to likewise endure and remain firm, abiding through the eons?\n\nZhong said: The great Dao is formless, taking form through what it attains. The great Dao is nameless, taking names through what it possesses. Heaven and Earth attain it and call it the Dao of Qian and Kun; the sun and moon attain it and call it the Dao of yin and yang. If humans attain it in the court, it is called the Dao of ruler and minister; in the inner chambers, the Dao of husband and wife; in the village, the Dao of elder and younger; in the school, the Dao of friends; in the household, the Dao of father and son. Thus, what appears externally is never without the Dao. As for the union of father and mother: the father’s yang essence advances first while yin follows, true qi entering true water, the fire of the heart and the water of the kidneys refining into essence. Once the essence is emitted, encountering the mother’s yin, it first advances with water to cleanse the useless places; encountering the mother’s yang, it first advances with blood to receive it before the uterus. Essence and blood form the fetal sac, and true qi enters the mother’s womb. Over days and months, true qi transforms and shapes the person. Like Heaven and Earth practicing the Dao, Qian and Kun seeking each other generate the three yin and three yang: true qi as yang, true water as yin, yang concealing water within, yin concealing qi within. Qi governs ascent, and within qi is true water; water governs descent, and within water is true qi. True water is true yin; true qi is true yang. True yang follows water in descending, as Qian seeks Kun: above is Zhen, in the middle is Kan, below is Gen. Comparing this to humans, with the center as the measure, from above downward: Zhen is the liver, Kan the kidneys, Gen the bladder. True yin follows qi in ascending, as Kun seeks Qian: below is Xun, in the middle is Li, above is Dui. Comparing this to humans, with the center as the measure, from below upward: Xun is the gallbladder, Li the heart, Dui the lungs. Once the form is complete and the allotted time fulfilled, the child departs from the mother. After birth, original yang resides in the kidneys, generating true qi through original yang; true qi ascends to the heart. Through true qi, true fluid is generated, and true fluid returns to the origin. Ascending and descending in ceaseless exchange, if nothing is depleted, one may prolong life. If one knows the timing without error and regulates addition and withdrawal with precision, one may attain immortality. If one engages in cultivation without weariness and persists in practice without cease, yin will be exhausted and yang purified, allowing one to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood. This is the profound principle of the celestial mechanism, a matter not transmitted through the ages. If you hold faith without doubt, regard fame and profit as fleeting as willow twigs, love and attachment as formidable as bandits, avoid illness as one fears death, guard against losing the body to another shell, and contemplate the transmigration of the spirit into other forms—if you possess the resolve for tranquility, then first strengthen your root, lest original yang be lost and true qi dissipated.\n\nWhen qi flourishes, the ethereal soul harbors no yin; when yang is robust, the corporeal soul contains qi. In their ascent and descent, they emulate nothing beyond heaven and earth; in their waxing and waning, they resemble the sun and moon.\n\n**On the Sun and Moon**\nLü said: \"The principles of heaven and earth are but roughly understood. Can the intertwining cycles and conjunctions of the sun and moon be likened to man?\"\nI wish to hear of this.\n\nZhong said: \"The Great Dao is formless, yet it engenders heaven and earth. The Great Dao is nameless, yet it propels the sun and moon. The sun and moon are the essence of Greater Yin and Greater Yang, silently recording the degrees of heaven and earth’s conjunctions, aiding in the generation and transformation of the myriad things. Rising in the east and setting in the west, they divide day and night; moving south and north, they determine cold and heat. Unceasing in their alternation of day and night, hastening the succession of cold and heat, the corporeal soul gives birth to the ethereal soul, and the ethereal soul gives birth to the corporeal soul. Advancing and retreating in due time, they do not err from the reckoning of Qian and Kun; coming and going by measure, they do not deviate from the appointed cycles of heaven and earth.\"\n\nLü said: \"How do they rise in the east and set in the west to divide day and night?\"\nZhong said: \"When primal chaos first divided and the Dark and Yellow settled into place, the form of heaven and earth resembled an egg, with the Six Directions enclosed within, round as a sphere. The sun and moon rise and set, moving above the heavens and below the earth, circling east and west in their course like a wheel. When the sun rises in the east and has not yet set in the west, it is day; when it sets in the west and has not yet risen in the east, it is night—thus the sun’s rising and setting divide day and night. The moon’s rising and setting differ from the sun’s: it bears its corporeal soul in the west and receives its ethereal soul in the east, shining its light by night while its ethereal soul lies hidden by day. As days and hours accumulate, it rises and sets, moving from west to east. At first, the ethereal soul is born within the corporeal soul, appearing like a drawn bow, its light shining in the west at early night. Next, the ethereal soul fills half the corporeal soul, corresponding to the first quarter, its light shining in the south at early night. Then, the ethereal soul fills the corporeal soul entirely, facing the sun, its light shining in the east at early night. Next, the corporeal soul is born within the ethereal soul, appearing like a broken mirror, its ethereal soul hidden in the west at early day. Then, the corporeal soul fills half the ethereal soul, corresponding to the last quarter, its ethereal soul hidden in the south at early day. Finally, the corporeal soul fills the ethereal soul entirely, turning its back to the sun, its ethereal soul hidden in the east at early day—thus the moon’s rising and setting divide day and night.\"\n\nLü said: \"How do they move south and north to determine cold and heat?\"\nZhong said: \"After the winter solstice, the sun rises at the beginning of *chen* with fifty *fen* and sets at the end of *shen* with fifty *fen*. Thereafter, its rising and setting shift from south to north, reaching the summer solstice as the limit. After the summer solstice, the sun rises at the end of *yin* with fifty *fen* and sets at the beginning of *xu* with fifty *fen*. Thereafter, its rising and setting shift from north to south, reaching the winter solstice as the limit. From south to north, from winter to summer, cold turns to heat; from north to south, from summer to winter, heat turns to cold. The summer day is the winter night, and the winter day is the summer night. After the winter solstice, the moon rises from north to south, corresponding to the summer day; after the summer solstice, the moon rises from south to north, corresponding to the winter day—thus the sun and moon’s coming and going determine cold and heat.\"\n\nLü said: \"The mechanism of heaven and earth, the ascent and descent of yin and yang, is no different from man’s practice. Can the sun and moon’s rising and setting, their coming and going, their intertwining cycles and conjunctions, be likened to man?\"\nZhong said: \"The mechanism of heaven and earth lies in the ascent and descent of yin and yang. In their ascent and descent, the Supreme Ultimate is born; in their mutual generation and completion, they cycle endlessly, never straying from the Dao and thus attaining longevity. If the cultivator takes heaven and earth as their model, they too may attain long life without death. If likened to the sun and moon’s measured movements, their coming and going, their conjunctions, it is only that the moon receives the sun’s ethereal soul, transforming yang into yin, exhausting yin and purifying yang, so that the moon’s radiance gleams, dispelling its dark corporeal soul, like the sun’s brilliance illuminating the earth below. At such a time, it is like man’s cultivation: refining qi into spirit, shedding the mortal form to ascend as an immortal, forging a body of pure yang.\"\n\nLü said: \"For those who cultivate the truth and uphold the Dao, in grasping the principles of heaven and earth’s yin-yang ascent and descent, the sun and moon’s essence in their conjunctions—where should they begin their practice, and which of the two should come first?\"\nZhong said: \"First, emulate the celestial mechanism, clarify the principles of yin and yang’s ascent and descent, so that true water and true fire merge as one, refining the great elixir to eternally guard the cinnabar field, enduring through eons without death and attaining a lifespan equal to heaven and earth. If weary of the dusty world and persisting in practice, then seize the conjunction of sun and moon, refining yang with yang so that yin does not arise, nurturing spirit with qi so that spirit does not scatter. With the five qi converging at the origin and the three flowers gathering at the crown, one severs ties with the vulgar and returns to the Three Isles.\"\n\nLü said: \"If the efficacy of such practice deeply penetrates its purport, the only concern is not knowing the proper timing.\"\nZhong said: \"The ascent and descent of heaven and earth’s yin and yang conjoin once a year; the sun and moon’s essence comes and goes, conjoining once a month; man’s qi and fluids conjoin once a day and night.\"\n\n**On the Four Seasons**\nLü said: \"May I hear of the conjunctions of heaven, earth, sun, and moon in years, months, days, and hours?\"\nZhong said: \"There are four kinds of time: for a man who lives a hundred years, from one to thirty is the time of youth and vigor; from thirty to sixty is the time of maturity; from sixty to ninety is the time of old age; from ninety to a hundred or a hundred and twenty is the time of decline and decay—this is the first kind, the time within the body. If reckoned by the twelve earthly branches, five days make a *hou*, three *hou* make a *qi*, three *qi* make a *jie*, two *jie* make a season, and the seasons are spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\"\n\nIn spring, yin holds half of yang, and its qi transforms from cold to warmth—this is the time of spring. In summer, yang contains yang, and its qi transforms from warmth to heat—this is the time of summer. In autumn, yang holds half of yin, and its qi transforms from heat to chill—this is the time of autumn. In winter, yin contains yin, and its qi transforms from chill to cold—this is the time of winter. These are called the times within the year, the second kind.\n\nWhen the pitch pipes resonate in sequence—*lü* arising from *zhong* and *zhong* from *lü*—a month consists of thirty days, three hundred and sixty hours, and three thousand *ke* with one hundred eighty thousand divisions. From the new moon to the first quarter, yin holds half of yang; from the first quarter to the full moon, yang contains yang; from the full moon to the last quarter, yang holds half of yin; from the last quarter to the dark moon, yin contains yin. These are the times within the month, the third kind.\n\nTaking sixty *fen* as one *ke*, eight *ke* and twenty *fen* as one hour, and one and a half hours as one *gua*, the *gua* fixes the eight directions, while the cardinal divisions number four. From *zi* to *mao*, yin holds half of yang, as lesser yang arises within greater yin. From *mao* to *wu*, yang contains yang, as pure lesser yang gives rise to greater yang. From *wu* to *you*, yang holds half of yin, as lesser yin arises within greater yang. From *you* to *zi*, yin contains yin, as pure lesser yin gives rise to greater yin. These are the times within the day, the fourth kind.\n\nThat which is swift to lose and hard to gain is the time within the body. That which departs quickly and returns slowly is the months within the year. That which flashes like lightning or sparks like flint is the hours within the day. Days accumulate into months, months into years; as years and months slip by, the light of time speeds onward. Yet men still covet fame and chase profit, their deluded hearts unchecked; they dote on children and cherish grandchildren, their attachments ever renewed. Even if they turn their hearts to the Dao, how can they escape old age and failing qi? Like spring snow or autumn blossoms, they endure but a fleeting moment; like the setting sun or the morning moon, they cast no light that lasts. For those who follow the Dao, the rarest treasure is the time within the body.\n\nBright sun and enchanting scenes, a hundred flowers in bloom, waterside pavilions and lofty towers, refreshing winds and carefree delight, moonlit conversations and snowy-day feasts—indulging in endless pleasures, they fritter away their finite time. Even if they turn their hearts to the Dao, it is only when illness clings to the body. Like a broken boat yet to cross the river, who would not seek rescue? Like a leaking roof repaired again, who could bear to abandon further mending? For those who follow the Dao, they squander the time of youth within their prime.\n\nThe neighbor’s rooster has not yet crowed, yet they chide themselves for rising late; the street drums are barely heard, yet they regret returning home too soon. Greed and delusion never pause for rest, and vain desires know no satisfaction. Gold and jade fill the hall, but when illness comes, what can withstand it? A house full of children and grandchildren—yet when the breath ceases, who can take their place? Day and night turn without cease, yet the world remains unaware. For those who follow the Dao, the most lamentable is the time within the day.\n\nLü said: \"The time within the body, the time within the year, the time within the month, and the time within the day—all are time. Yet why, Master, do you deem the time within the body the hardest to obtain and the time within the day the most regrettable?\"\n\nZhong said: \"For those who follow the Dao, youth is hard to come by. In youth, cultivation strengthens the root and foundation; all things are easily accomplished, and great attainment may be reached in a thousand days. For those who follow the Dao, middle age is also hard to come by. In middle age, cultivation first repairs and completes, then proceeds to progress. At first, one returns from old age to youth; later, one enters sagehood and transcends the mundane.\n\nYet those who follow the Dao may not awaken in youth, nor realize in middle age. Some turn their minds to clarity and stillness only after disaster strikes; others set their hearts on the subtle and formless only when illness befalls. In late-life cultivation, one must first speak of salvation and protection, then of supplementation and benefit. Only then, beginning with the lesser accomplishment, can one accumulate merit to reach the middle accomplishment. The middle accomplishment allows one to accumulate merit only to the point of returning from old age to youth and refining the form to abide in the world. Yet the five qi cannot ascend to the origin, the three yangs cannot gather at the crown, and casting off the mortal frame to ascend as an immortal remains unattainable. Thus, the time within the body is the hardest to obtain.\"\n\nLü said: \"I now understand that the time within the body is indeed hard to obtain. But why is the time within the day most regrettable?\"\n\nZhong said: \"A single day for a person is like a month for the sun and moon, like a year for heaven and earth. The Great Dao gives birth to heaven and earth; heaven and earth divide above and below, separated by eighty-four thousand *li*. After the winter solstice, yang ascends from within the earth. For each *qi*, lasting fifteen days, it rises seven thousand *li*. Over one hundred eighty days, yang ascends to heaven, and the Supreme Ultimate generates yin. After the summer solstice, yin descends from within heaven. For each *qi*, lasting fifteen days, it descends seven thousand *li*. Over one hundred eighty days, yin descends to earth, and the Supreme Ultimate regenerates yang. Thus it cycles endlessly, ceaselessly revolving without straying from the Dao—hence its longevity.\n\nThe sun and moon, set in motion, take form, each encircling eight hundred forty *li*. After the new moon, six arises within nine. For each day, comprising twelve hours, the *hun* advances seventy *li* within the *po*. Over fifteen days, comprising one hundred eighty hours, the *hun* advances eight hundred forty *li* within the *po*. After the full moon, nine arises within six. For each day, comprising twelve hours, the *po* advances seventy *li* within the *hun*. Over fifteen days, comprising one hundred eighty hours, the *po* advances eight hundred forty *li* within the *hun*. Thus it cycles endlessly, ceaselessly revolving without straying from the Dao—hence its firmness.\n\nThe Great Dao nurtures the myriad things, and among them, the most numinous and noble is man.\"\n\nThe human heart and kidneys, separated by eight *cun* and four *fen* above and below, ascend and descend in yin and yang—no different from Heaven and Earth. Within *qi* arises fluid, within fluid arises *qi*; *qi* and fluid generate each other, following the same path as the sun and moon. Heaven and Earth intertwine through *qian* and *kun* in the ascent and descent of yin and yang, uniting once a year without straying from the Dao—thus each year begets another. The sun and moon, through the interplay of *hun* and *po*, exchange their essence, uniting once a month without straying from the Dao—thus each month begets another. Yet in human union, though it occurs day and night, one knows not the moment of union, nor the method of refinement; when depletion comes, one knows not how to replenish, and when abundance comes, one knows not how to gather. When yin unites, one knows not how to nurture yang; when yang unites, one knows not how to refine yin. Within the month, one discerns not gain and loss; within the day, one practices no discipline. Thus a year passes without yielding another, a day without yielding another. Exposed to wind, lying in dampness, braving heat and cold, one refuses cultivation yet willingly suffers illness, squandering time in idleness, sitting in wait for death.\n\nLü says: Those who follow the Dao are not unaware that their years pass in vain, their months slip by in neglect, while illness clings to the body and the hour of death draws near. Yet they fail in cultivation for want of method, in practice for want of timing—thus the union of yin and yang falters, and the discipline of months and hours lacks precision.\n\nZhong says: Within the body, a year is measured; within the year, a month; within the month, a day; within the day, an hour. For the *qi* of the five viscera waxes and wanes with the month, advances and retreats with the day, and unites with the hour. Moving through five phases, *qi* transmits across six intervals—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth align without error, while East, West, South, North, and Center follow their ordained numbers. Refine essence to generate true *qi*, refine *qi* to unite with yang spirit, refine spirit to unite with the Great Dao.\n\nOn the Five Phases\nLü says: The *qi* of the five viscera corresponds to Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth; the positions of the Five Phases correspond to East, West, South, North, and Center. How then do they generate and complete one another, uniting in due time? How does one gather them at the proper hour? I would hear of this.\n\nZhong says: When the Great Dao divided, it gave birth to Heaven and Earth; when Heaven and Earth separated, the Five Emperors took their places. In the East resides the Azure Emperor, who executes the spring mandate—within yin, yang arises, causing the myriad things to be born. In the South resides the Vermilion Emperor, who executes the summer mandate—within yang, yang ascends, causing the myriad things to grow. In the West resides the White Emperor, who executes the autumn mandate—within yang, yin arises, causing the myriad things to mature. In the North resides the Black Emperor, who executes the winter mandate—within yin, yin advances, causing the myriad things to die. Each of the four seasons spans ninety days, with eighteen days at the end of each season governed by the Yellow Emperor. Thus, in spring, he assists the Azure Emperor in bringing forth life; in summer, he follows the Vermilion Emperor in nurturing growth; in autumn, he aids the White Emperor in fruition; and in winter, he restrains the Black Emperor to enforce severity. The Five Emperors each govern seventy-two days, totaling three hundred and sixty days to form a year, assisting Heaven and Earth in enacting the Dao.\n\nThe Azure Emperor begets offspring named *jia* and *yi*, which are Wood of the East. The Vermilion Emperor begets offspring named *bing* and *ding*, which are Fire of the South. The Yellow Emperor begets offspring named *wu* and *ji*, which are Earth of the Center. The White Emperor begets offspring named *geng* and *xin*, which are Metal of the West. The Black Emperor begets offspring named *ren* and *gui*, which are Water of the North. Manifest in time as symbols, Wood becomes the Azure Dragon, Fire the Vermilion Bird, Earth the Curved Array, Metal the White Tiger, and Water the Dark Warrior. Manifest in time to generate things: when *yi* and *geng* unite in spring, elm appears green while white, preserving the colors of Metal and Wood; when *xin* and *bing* unite in autumn, jujube appears white while red, preserving the colors of Metal and Fire; when *ji* and *geng* unite at summer’s end and autumn’s beginning, melon appears green while yellow, preserving the colors of Earth and Wood; when *ding* and *ren* unite in summer, paulownia appears red while black, preserving the colors of Water and Fire; when *gui* and *wu* unite in winter, tangerine appears black while yellow, preserving the colors of Water and Earth. By analogy, when the Five Emperors interact and manifest in time, life arises in countless things.\n\nLü says: The Five Phases operate in time as such—how then do they operate within humans?\nZhong says: Only humans possess a head round and feet square, embodying the image of Heaven and Earth. With yin descending and yang ascending, they further contain the mechanism of Heaven and Earth. The kidneys are Water, the heart is Fire, the liver is Wood, the lungs are Metal, and the spleen is Earth. Regarding the mutual generation of the Five Phases: Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal, Metal generates Water—what generates is the mother, what is generated is the child. Regarding their mutual overcoming: Water overcomes Fire, Fire overcomes Metal, Metal overcomes Wood, Wood overcomes Earth, Earth overcomes Water—what overcomes is the husband, what is overcome is the wife.\n\nIn terms of mother and child: kidney *qi* generates liver *qi*, liver *qi* generates heart *qi*, heart *qi* generates spleen *qi*, spleen *qi* generates lung *qi*, lung *qi* generates kidney *qi*. In terms of husband and wife: kidney *qi* overcomes heart *qi*, heart *qi* overcomes lung *qi*, lung *qi* overcomes liver *qi*, liver *qi* overcomes spleen *qi*, spleen *qi* overcomes kidney *qi*. The kidneys are the husband of the heart, the mother of the liver, the wife of the spleen, and the child of the lungs. The liver is the husband of the spleen, the mother of the heart, the wife of the lungs, and the child of the kidneys. The heart is the husband of the lungs, the mother of the spleen, the wife of the kidneys, and the child of the liver. The lungs are the husband of the liver, the mother of the kidneys, the wife of the heart, and the child of the spleen. The spleen is the husband of the kidneys, the mother of the lungs, the wife of the liver, and the child of the heart.\n\nThe heart’s internal manifestation is the pulse, its external manifestation is complexion. Its gate and door reside in the tongue, subject to the kidneys’ restraint while driven to serve the lungs—such is the principle of husband and wife. When it receives the liver, it flourishes; when it encounters the spleen, it wanes—such is the principle of mother and child. The kidneys’ internal manifestation is bone, their external manifestation is hair. Their gates and doors are the two ears, subject to the spleen’s restraint while driven to serve the heart—such is the principle of husband and wife. When they receive the lungs, they flourish; when they encounter the liver, they wane—such is the principle of mother and child. The liver’s internal manifestation is sinew, its external manifestation is nails. Its gates and doors are the eyes, subject to the lungs’ restraint while driven to serve the spleen—such is the principle of husband and wife. When it encounters the kidneys, it flourishes; when it encounters the heart, it wanes—such is the principle of mother and child. The lungs’ internal manifestation is skin, their external manifestation is body hair. Their gates and doors are the nose, subject to the heart’s restraint while driven to serve the liver—such is the principle of husband and wife. When they receive the spleen, they flourish; when they encounter the kidneys, they wane—such is the principle of mother and child. The spleen’s internal manifestation is the viscera, nourishing the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs equally; its external manifestation is flesh. Its gates and doors are the lips and mouth, regulating the ebb and flow of breath, subject to the liver’s restraint while driven to serve the kidneys—such is the principle of husband and wife. When it receives the heart, it flourishes; when it encounters the lungs, it wanes—such is the principle of mother and child. These are the Five Phases within humans, mutually generating and overcoming as husbands, wives, mothers, and children, their transmission of *qi* and fluctuations of strength manifest herein.\n\nLü says: The heart is Fire—how then can Fire descend? The kidneys are Water—how can Water ascend? The spleen is Earth, and Earth at the center supports Fire to flourish—does it not then overcome Water below? The lungs are Metal, and Metal above, when adjacent to Fire below, is damaged—how can it generate Water? In mutual generation, they are separated by intervals; in mutual overcoming, they are closely bound and difficult to alter. With these Five Phases thus harming and overcoming one another, what is to be done?\n\nZhong says: The Five Phases return to their origin, a single *qi* drawing them forth. Primordial yang ascends and generates true Water; true Water transforms and generates true *qi*; true *qi* transforms and generates the yang spirit. At the outset, the Five Phases are fixed in position, each with one husband and one wife.\n\nThe kidneys are Water, and within Water lies Metal—Metal being the mother of Water. At the beginning, one must recognize the Metal within Water. Water naturally resents Earth, so after gathering the medicine, Earth must be returned to Water.\n\nThe dragon is the image of the liver; the tiger is the spirit of the lungs. The yang dragon emerges from the Li Palace; the yin tiger arises from the Kan position.\n\nWhen the Five Phases move in reverse, *qi* is transmitted from child to mother—from *zi* to *wu*, this is the time when yang is born of yang. When the Five Phases are inverted, fluids flow between husband and wife—from *wu* to *zi*, this is refining yang within yin.\n\nYang cannot be completed without yin, yet in the end, there is no yin that does not perish. Yin cannot be generated without yang, yet in the end, when yin is cut off, longevity is achieved.\n\nLü says: The Five Phases originate from the single *qi* of yin and yang—what is meant by \"single *qi*\"?\n\nZhong says: The single *qi* refers to when father and mother unite, their essence and blood transforming to form the body. The kidneys generate the spleen; the spleen generates the liver; the liver generates the lungs; the lungs generate the heart; the heart generates the small intestine; the small intestine generates the large intestine; the large intestine generates the gallbladder; the gallbladder generates the stomach; the stomach generates the bladder. Thus, yin forms the body through essence and blood, while yang resides solely at the origin of life’s beginning—a single point of primordial yang within the two kidneys.\n\nNow, the kidneys are Water, and within Water lies Fire. When Fire ascends, it becomes *qi*, and this *qi* rises to pay homage to the heart. The heart is yang, and when yang unites with yang, the Supreme Ultimate generates yin. Thus, accumulated *qi* generates fluid, and this fluid descends from the heart, returning to the kidneys.\n\nThe liver is the mother of the heart and the child of the kidneys, transmitting the *qi* of the kidneys to the heart. The lungs are the wife of the heart and the mother of the kidneys, conveying the fluids of the heart to the kidneys.\n\nThe ascent and descent of *qi* and fluids resemble the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth; the transmission between liver and lungs is like the cyclical movement of the sun and moon. The Five Phases are but names and numbers. In their union and generation, primordial yang and a single *qi* are the foundation. Within *qi*, true Water is born; within fluids, true *qi* arises. The kidneys are the root of *qi*; the heart is the source of fluids. When the numinous root is firm, all is indistinct and subtle. Within *qi*, true Water naturally arises; when the heart’s source is pure, all is profound and obscure. Within fluids, true Fire naturally exists. Within Fire, one recognizes the true dragon; within Water, one discerns the true tiger.\n\nWhen dragon and tiger unite, they transform into the yellow sprout. When the yellow sprout is conjoined, it coalesces into the great medicine—this is called the Golden Elixir. Once the Golden Elixir is achieved, one is called an immortal.\n\nLü says: When the Golden Elixir is complete and the body is shed to ascend as an immortal, returning to the Ten Isles—this is well understood. But what is meant by the \"yellow sprout\"?\n\nZhong says: It is the true dragon and the true tiger.\n\nLü says: What are the dragon and tiger?\n\nZhong says: The dragon is not the liver but the yang dragon. The yang dragon emerges from within the true Water of the Li Palace. The tiger is not the lungs but the yin tiger. The yin tiger arises from within the true Fire of the Kan position.\n\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating the Dao: Zhong-Lü Transmission of the Dao, Scroll Fourteen (conclusion)*\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating the Dao: Zhong-Lü Transmission of the Dao, Scroll Fifteen*\n\nZhenyang Perfected Zhongli Quan (Yunfang) instructed Pure Yang Perfected Lü Dongbin (Yanpin) of Mount Dong, who transmitted it to Huayang Perfected Shi Jianwu (Xisheng). On Water and Fire.\n\nLü says: Those who attain long life refine the Golden Elixir. To refine the Golden Elixir, one must first gather the yellow sprout. To obtain the yellow sprout, one must secure the dragon and tiger. The true dragon emerges from the Li Palace, the true tiger arises from the Kan position. Within Li and Kan reside water and fire—what are water and fire?\n\nZhong says: In the body, when speaking of water, there are the Four Seas, Five Lakes, Nine Rivers, Three Isles, Flowery Pond, Jasper Pond, Phoenix Pond, Heavenly Pond, Jade Pond, Kun Pond, Primordial Abyss, and Root Garden. There are divine water, golden waves, jade liquid, jasper springs, yang suet, and white snow—such names cannot be fully enumerated. When speaking of fire in the body, there are only the sovereign fire, ministerial fire, and civilian fire. These three fires take primordial yang as their root and generate true qi. When true qi gathers, one is at peace; when true qi weakens, illness arises. If true qi is dissipated and primordial yang lost, primordial yang exhausted, pure yin prevails, and the primordial spirit departs the body—this is called death.\n\nLü says: Within the human body, a single point of primordial yang ignites the three fires. These three fires arise amid the multitude of waters and yin forces, easily dissipated yet difficult to blaze brightly. If yang is weak and yin abundant, fire scant and water plentiful, one swiftly declines and cannot attain long life. What is to be done?\n\nZhong says: The heart is the sea of blood, the kidneys the sea of qi, the brain the sea of marrow, and the spleen and stomach the sea of water and grain—thus are these Four Seas. The five viscera each have their fluids, governing the positions of east, west, south, north, and center—thus are these Five Lakes. The small intestine, two zhang and four chi in length, winds through nine curves—these are the Nine Rivers. Below the small intestine lies the Primordial Abyss—thus is this described. The head is the upper isle, the heart the middle isle, and the kidneys the lower isle—within these Three Isles, the root and source are spoken of as the Garden of Fragrance. The Flowery Pond lies below the Yellow Court, the Jasper Pond emerges before the Cinnabar Gate, the Kun Pond connects above to the Jade Capital, and the Heavenly Pond directly pierces the Inner Court. The Phoenix Pond lies between the heart and lungs, the Jade Pond within the lips and teeth. Divine water is born within qi, golden waves descend from heaven. Where the red dragon dwells, jasper liquid naturally flows; the jade spring of the mortal embryo only reveals white snow and yang suet after transformation. Watering must be timely to nourish blazing vigor: first the jade liquid, then the golden liquid—both can be used to revert the elixir. Withdrawal and replenishment must be measured to correspond with bathing: first the middle field, then the lower field—both can be used to refine the form. Jade medicine and golden blossoms transform the body into yellow and white; ghee and sweet dew refine it into wondrous fragrance. Such are the efficacies of water.\n\nAs for fire: the civilian fire ascends to assist kidney qi in generating true water; kidney fire ascends to merge with heart liquid, producing true qi. In small measure, it subdues demons and dispels illness; in great measure, it refines the body and burns the elixir. When applied to the Zhou Tian cycle, fire arises to incinerate the body; when the Yang Pass is restrained, it reverts to the origin and refines the medicine. Distinguishing the terrain of the Nine Continents nurtures the yang spirit; burning the burdens of the Three Corpses expels yin ghosts. Ascending, it strikes through the Three Passes in one thrust; descending, it dissolves the Seven Po. Refining form into qi, one becomes light and soars like flight; refining qi into spirit, one sheds the embryo like a molting cicada. Such are the efficacies of fire.\n\nLü says: At first, I heard your instruction and feared that scant fire and abundant water would lead to swift decline. Now, having listened to your lofty discourse, I see that water and fire possess such wondrous efficacy. Ultimately, how does one transform things so that the few can overcome the many, and the weak can become strong?\n\nZhong says: When the two eights of yin dissolve, the nine threes of yang grow. The radiant Golden Elixir can be accomplished in days; with seven returns and nine reversions, the fetal immortal naturally transforms. True qi resides in the heart, and the heart is the source of liquid. Primordial yang resides in the kidneys, and the kidneys are the sea of qi. The bladder is the civilian fire, yet without the civilian fire, it cannot function. The bladder is also the palace of fluids. If one fails to comprehend the celestial mechanism and fathom the mysterious principle, even those who uphold the Dao will struggle to achieve transformation and may succumb to illness and death.\n\nLü says: What is meant by transformation that causes yang to grow and yin to dissolve, allowing the Golden Elixir to form and the fetal immortal to naturally transform?\n\nZhong says: The heart and kidneys are separated by eight cun and four fen—this mirrors the fixed positions of heaven and earth. The generation of qi and liquid from the Supreme Ultimate mirrors the union of yin and yang. The twelve hours of a day mirror the twelve months of a year. The heart generates liquid, yet it does not do so on its own: it is because lung liquid descends to the heart, and the liquid of the heart flows. The liquid flows as husband and wife, descending from above to return to the lower field—this is called \"the wife returning to the husband’s palace.\" The kidneys generate qi, yet they do not do so on their own: it is because bladder qi ascends, and kidney qi flows. The qi flows as mother and child, ascending from below to pay homage to the middle origin—this is called \"the husband returning to the wife’s chamber.\" Liver qi guides kidney qi upward to reach the heart. The heart is fire. When the two qi merge, they steam the lungs; lung liquid descends from the heart—this is called \"the heart generating liquid.\" Since the liquid born of the heart is not dissipated, it is called true water. Lung liquid conveys heart liquid downward to the kidneys. The kidneys are water. When the two waters merge, they moisten the bladder; bladder qi ascends from the kidneys—this is called \"the kidneys generating qi.\" Since the qi born of the kidneys is not consumed, it is called true fire. True fire emerges from within water—vague and indistinct, within it lies something. Gazing, one cannot see it; seeking, one cannot grasp it.\n\nTrue water emerges from within fire—dim and obscure, within it lies essence. Gazing, one cannot retain it; retaining, one cannot hold it.\n\nLü says: The kidneys are water. Qi born of water is called true fire. But what substance lies within fire? The heart is fire. Liquid born of fire is called true water. What essence lies within water? The substance within fire and the essence within water—being formless and ungraspable, even if sought, it is hard to obtain; even if obtained, what use is it?\n\nZhong says: The ancient sages of highest attainment never departed from this. When the two substances unite in intercourse, they transform into the yellow sprout. When the count is complete and the embryo perfected, the great medicine is formed—this is the true dragon and true tiger.\n\n**On the Dragon and Tiger**\nLü says: The dragon is the image of the liver; the tiger is the spirit of the lungs. Now, within this heart-fire, liquid is born—this liquid is true water. Within this water, dim and obscure, the true dragon lies hidden. Why does the dragon, though not in the liver, emerge from the Li Palace? Within this kidney-water, qi is born—this qi is true fire. Within this fire, vague and indistinct, the true tiger lies concealed. Why does the tiger, though not in the lungs, arise from the Kan position?\n\nZhong says: The dragon is a yang entity. Ascending and soaring in the heavens, when it roars, clouds arise; when it receives moisture, it nourishes the myriad things. In imagery, it is the Azure Dragon; in direction, it is Jia and Yi; in substance, it is wood; in season, it is spring; in the Dao, it is benevolence; in the hexagrams, it is Zhen; within the five viscera of the human body, it is the liver.\n\nThe tiger is a yin entity. Running upon the earth, when it howls, wind arises; when it reaches the mountains, its might subdues the hundred creatures. In imagery, it is the White Tiger; in direction, it is Geng and Xin; in substance, it is metal; in season, it is autumn; in the Dao, it is righteousness; in the hexagrams, it is Dui; within the five viscera of the human body, it is the lungs.\n\nNow, the liver is yang yet resides in a yin position. Thus, kidney qi transmits to liver qi, moving as mother and child—water generates wood. When kidney qi is sufficient, liver qi is born. Once liver qi is born, it severs the kidney’s residual yin, and pure yang qi ascends.\n\nThe lungs are yin yet reside in a yang position. Thus, heart liquid transmits to lung liquid, moving as husband and wife—fire restrains metal. When heart liquid arrives, lung liquid is born. Once lung liquid is born, it severs the heart’s residual yang, and pure yin liquid descends.\n\nSince the liver pertains to yang and severs the kidney’s residual yin, we know that when qi passes through the liver, it becomes pure yang. Within pure yang qi, true unity’s water is concealed—vague and formless, it is called the yang dragon.\n\nSince the lungs pertain to yin and sever the heart’s residual yang, we know that when liquid reaches the lungs, it becomes pure yin. Within pure yin liquid, the correct yang’s radiance is borne—dim and unseen, it is called the yin tiger.\n\nQi ascends and liquid descends; inherently, they cannot unite. Yet within qi lies true unity’s water, which, upon seeing liquid, harmonizes with it. Within liquid lies correct yang’s qi, which, upon seeing qi, naturally gathers.\n\nIf, during transmission, one applies the method to govern it—preventing kidney qi from scattering, gathering true unity’s water from within qi; preventing heart liquid from dissipating, extracting correct yang’s radiance from within liquid—then mother and child meet, mutually cherishing each other. Daily, it grows to the size of a millet grain. After a hundred days, the medicine’s power is complete without flaw. After two hundred days, the sacred embryo hardens. After three hundred days, the fetal immortal is perfected—its form like a pellet, its color like a red tangerine. This is called the elixir medicine. Forever anchoring the lower field, preserving form and abiding in the world, one endures through eons, becoming an immortal upon the earth.\n\nLü says: Kidney water generates qi, and within qi lies true unity’s water—this is called the yin tiger. The tiger, upon seeing liquid, harmonizes with it. Heart fire generates liquid, and within liquid lies correct yang’s qi—this is called the yang dragon. The dragon, upon seeing qi, harmonizes with it. Things gather by kind, and principles divide by nature—this is only natural.\n\nWhen qi is born, liquid also descends. Does true unity’s water within qi not follow liquid downward, transmitting through the five viscera? When liquid is born, qi also ascends. Does correct yang’s qi within liquid not follow qi upward, emerging from the layered tower?\n\nTrue water follows liquid downward—the tiger cannot unite with the dragon. True yang follows qi upward—the dragon cannot unite with the tiger. If dragon and tiger do not unite, how can the yellow sprout arise? Without the yellow sprout, how can the great medicine be formed?\n\nZhong says: When kidney qi is born, it is like the sun emerging from the sea—mist and dew cannot obscure its light. Liquid descends like a sparse curtain—how can it withstand the qi? When qi is robust, true unity’s water naturally flourishes.\n\nWhen heart liquid is born, it is like the severe sky killing things—breath cannot resist its cold. Qi ascends like a jade screen—how can it withstand the liquid? When liquid is abundant, correct yang’s qi may be strong or weak—its certainty is not assured.\n\nLü says: Qi and liquid each arise in their own time. When it is the time for qi to be born, if qi is abundant, true unity’s water is also abundant. When it is the time for liquid to be born, if liquid is abundant, correct yang’s qi is also abundant. Yet why is their flourishing and decline not guaranteed?\n\nZhong says: Kidney qi is easily dissipated—what is hard to obtain is the true tiger. Heart liquid is hard to accumulate—what is easily lost is the true dragon. The ten thousand volumes of elixir classics discuss nothing beyond yin and yang. Within yin and yang, the essence is nothing but dragon and tiger. Among those who uphold the Dao, perhaps one or two in ten thousand understand. Some, though widely read and learned, may know the principles of dragon and tiger but fail to recognize the moment of their union, unaware of the method of gathering. Thus, from ancient times to the present, accomplished scholars—though they cultivate with white-haired devotion, achieving only minor attainment—prolong life across generations but never hear of transcending. This is because they cannot unite dragon and tiger, gather the yellow sprout, and refine the elixir medicine.\n\nOn the Elixir Medicine\n\nLü said: \"The principles of dragon and tiger are now understood—may I hear of the great medicine of the Golden Elixir?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"What is called 'medicine' can cure illness. There are three grades of illness: lying in drafts or dampness, braving heat or cold, overwork or indolence, hunger or surfeit at untimely hours—if one does not rest when unwell, illness comes daily. Such is seasonal sickness. Then there are those who refuse to cultivate and discipline themselves, indulging their passions and desires, scattering their primordial yang and depleting their true qi—when they grow old and withered, it is called aging. Such is the sickness of years. And when qi is exhausted and the body hollow, the hun-soul disperses and the shen-soul scatters, a long sigh escapes, the four great elements lose their master, and the body lies abandoned in the wild—this is called death. Such is the sickness of the body.\n\nFor seasonal sickness, as the four seasons cycle through cold, heat, warmth, and frost, if yang is excessive and yin insufficient, one should treat it with cold; if yin is excessive and yang insufficient, one should treat it with warmth. The aged tend toward cold, the young toward heat; the stout have abundant phlegm, the emaciated suffer from accumulations. Men’s illnesses arise from qi, women’s afflictions stem from blood. One supplements the deficient and reduces the excessive, preserves the weak and diminishes the surplus. For minor cases, acupuncture and moxibustion suffice; for severe ones, medicinal decoctions are used. Though occasional discomfort may lead to seasonal illness, a skilled physician can prescribe remedies tailored to the ailment, and all may be cured.\n\nYet how is the sickness of aging to be healed? How is the sickness of death to be treated? Those ancient physicians who could wash the intestines and replenish the flesh—restoring youthful complexion to wrinkled faces and white hair—none have mastered their art. Those who could replace the crown of the head and rejoin severed limbs—preserving form and dwelling in the world to attain long life—none have grasped their method.\"\n\nLü said: \"Occasional discomfort, when it becomes seasonal illness, can indeed be cured by skilled physicians and famous medicines. But what of the sickness of decrepit old age, the suffering of qi’s exhaustion and life’s end? How are these to be treated—is there no medicine for them?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"There are three grades of illness: seasonal sickness is cured by herbal medicines. For the sickness of the body and the sickness of years, there are two kinds of medicine: the Internal Elixir and the External Elixir.\"\n\nLü asked: \"What is the External Elixir?\"\n\nZhong said: \"In ancient times, the Most High Primordial Lord transmitted the Dao to humanity, explaining the principles of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, the proper cycles of the sun and moon. Thereafter, elixir classics filled the world, and people came to know the great Dao. The Venerable Guangcheng taught the Yellow Emperor, who, in the intervals of governance, practiced according to the method but saw no results for a long time. Guangcheng then revealed that between heart and kidney there exists true qi and true water, and between qi and water there exists true yin and true yang. Their union forms the great medicine, comparable to the supreme treasure hidden within metals and stones. Thus, on Mount Kongtong, he refined the great elixir using internal methods.\n\nAmong the eight stones, only cinnabar is used, and mercury is extracted from it. Among the five metals, only black lead is used, and silver is drawn from it. Mercury corresponds to the yang dragon, silver to the yin tiger. The heart’s fire is like cinnabar’s redness, the kidney’s water like lead’s blackness. The yearly fire follows the seasons without losing the strategy of heaven and earth; the monthly fire adjusts additions and subtractions according to the proper balance of civil and martial. A three-tiered furnace is erected, each tier nine inches high, square on the outside and round within, gathering the qi of the eight directions and aligning with the seasons of the four times. The golden crucible, containing lead and mercury, is no different from the liquid of the lungs. Sulfur serves as the medicine, harmonizing with the numinous cinnabar, comparable to the Yellow Dame.\n\nAfter three years of minor completion, consuming it can eradicate all illness. After six years of medium completion, it naturally extends life. After nine years of great completion, one ascends and moves freely. A stalwart warrior, stretching his arms, can traverse a thousand or ten thousand miles. Though he may not return to Penglai, he will not die even in the great kalpas of the human world.\"\n\nLü said: \"Since ancient times, many have refined elixirs, yet few have seen success. Why is this?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"There are three reasons why elixir refinement fails: First, one cannot distinguish true from false medicinal materials, nor understand the fire phases of additions and subtractions. The supreme treasure is thus reduced to smoke and ash in an instant, wasting time and effort, with nothing achieved. Second, though the medicinal materials may be fine, if one does not know the fire phases—or knows the fire phases but lacks the materials—the two do not harmonize, and nothing is achieved. Third, though the materials may be excellent and the fire phases appropriate, with no error in years, months, or days, and though the elixir is completed with sufficient qi, if one’s external conduct is not prepared, it transforms into a black crane and soars into the void, leaving no means to consume it. These are the three reasons for failure.\n\nMoreover, medicinal materials are the essence and fruit of heaven and earth’s finest qi, while fire phases are the protection of immortals who cultivate the Dao. In the time of the Three Sovereigns, the Yellow Emperor refined the nine-times-cycled elixir before it was complete. After the Five Emperors, the Primordial One refined the elixir for three years before it was done. By the Warring States period, baleful qi congealed in the sky, corpses littered the fields, and things could no longer receive heaven and earth’s finest qi—thus the world lacked medicinal materials. Those who possessed the method fled calamity and died in mountain valleys. Elixir formulas and immortal arts, though recorded on bamboo and silk, rotted away over time, and the world no longer had them. If the mundane world had medicinal materials, the First Emperor of Qin would not have sought them on the islands of the sea. If the mundane world had elixir formulas, Wei Boyang would not have studied the *Book of Changes*. Yet some, with vast learning and strong memory, mislead later generations, ruining ten thousand households without a single success—seeking externally is also a mistake.\"\n\nLü said: \"The principles of the External Elixir originate from Guangchengzi, who used internal methods as his model. Even if one achieves completion, it takes nine years, and medicinal materials are hard to find, formulas difficult to obtain. In the end, one may ascend and soar, but never sees transcendence into sagehood or return to the Ten Isles.\"\n\n\"May I dare ask about the Internal Elixir—could I hear of it?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"The External Elixir is not without use, but those who follow the Dao often awaken to this only in their later years, when their root and source are no longer deeply firm. The kidneys are the root of qi; if the root is not deep, the leaves cannot flourish. The heart is the source of fluids; if the source is not clear, the flow cannot be long. Thus, one borrows the Five Metals and Eight Stones, accumulating days and months to refine the Three Grades, each with three ranks, forming the Nine-Rank Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir. This aids in connecting one’s true qi, refining the form to abide in the world, and ascending lightly as if in flight.\n\nYet if one cultivates the Internal Work, recognizing the moment of union and knowing the method of gathering, the Embryonic Immortal is achieved, and transcendence is attained in a matter of days. Those who fail to comprehend this cling to the External Elixir, adding fire and increasing days to ingest it, hoping to ascend to the celestial realms—truly laughable. Since they do not investigate the source of the External Elixir, let me expound in detail the principles of the Internal Elixir.\n\nThe medicinal materials of the Internal Elixir arise from the heart and kidneys—something all people possess. The medicinal materials of the Internal Elixir originally reside in Heaven and Earth, which we see every day. The fire timing follows the cycles of the sun and moon’s waxing and waning; the refinement emulates the harmony of husband and wife’s union. The Sacred Embryo forms, and true qi is born. Within qi, there is qi—like a dragon nurturing its pearl. The Great Elixir is completed, and the Yang Spirit emerges. Beyond the body, there is another body—like a cicada shedding its husk.\n\nWithin this Internal Elixir, the Dragon and Tiger unite to transform into the Yellow Sprout, and from the Yellow Sprout, Lead and Mercury are distinguished.\n\n**On Lead and Mercury**\nLü said: \"The Internal Elixir does not transcend the Dragon and Tiger. The Tiger emerges from the Kan Palace—this is the water within qi. The Dragon emerges from the Li Palace—this is the qi within water. The External Elixir takes Mercury from cinnabar, likening it to the Yang Dragon, and uses the silver within lead, likening it to the Yin Tiger. Yet Lead and Mercury are External Elixir substances—how then do the Dragon and Tiger unite to transform into the Yellow Sprout, and from the Yellow Sprout, Lead and Mercury are distinguished? What, then, are the Lead and Mercury within the Internal Elixir?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"That which embraces the quality of Heavenly Oneness and stands as the chief of the Five Metals is black lead. Lead gives birth to silver, and thus lead is the mother of silver. That which responds to the qi of the Great Yang and stands as the chief of all stones is cinnabar. Cinnabar gives birth to Mercury, and thus Mercury is the child of cinnabar. What is difficult to extract is the silver within lead; what is easy to lose is the Mercury within cinnabar. When silver and Mercury are combined and refined, they naturally become a supreme treasure—this is the principle of Lead and Mercury as seen in the External Elixir.\n\nIf we speak of the Internal Work as it appears in humans, ancient and modern discussions differ, so let us take the most profound and wondrous explanation. At the moment of parents’ union, essence and blood combine, enclosing true qi, which is entrusted to the mother’s purely Yin palace, where the spirit is concealed within the unseparated Yin and Yang. After three hundred days, the embryo is complete; after five thousand days, the qi is full.\n\nIn terms of the Five Phases, the human body is fundamentally essence and blood—water comes first. In terms of the Five Viscera, essence and blood form the physical image, and the kidneys are born first. Within the Kidney Water, hidden from the moment of conception, lies the parents’ true qi. This true qi is concealed within the inner kidneys of a person—this is what is called Lead. The upright qi within the kidneys, the true Oneness Water within qi, is named the True Tiger—this is what is meant by the silver within lead.\n\nKidney qi transmits to Liver qi, and Liver qi transmits to Heart qi. The Heart qi reaches the Great Ultimate and generates fluid, within which resides the upright Yang qi—this is what is called cinnabar, the fluid of the heart. What is called Mercury is the upright Yang qi within the heart’s fluid. When the true Oneness Water within qi cherishes and harmonizes with the upright Yang qi within the fluid, qi and fluid accumulate to form the embryonic sac, which is conveyed into the Yellow Court. With flawless firing, the Embryonic Immortal naturally transforms—this is comparable to the union of lead and silver with Mercury, refined into a treasure.\n\nLü said: \"Among the Five Metals, one extracts silver from lead. Within the Eight Stones, Mercury is drawn from cinnabar. Placed in the crucible and matched with medicinal ingredients, Mercury naturally becomes cinnabar, and silver naturally becomes a treasure. Yet how does one extract silver from the Lead within a person? How does one draw Mercury from the cinnabar within a person? How does Mercury become cinnabar, and how does silver become a treasure?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"Lead fundamentally arises from the union of the parents’ true qi, pure and undivided. After the form is complete, it is stored within the kidneys. The two kidneys face each other, and together their qi ascends—this is called the Primordial Yang qi. Within this qi is water—this is called the true Oneness Water. Water rises with qi; when qi abides, water abides; when qi scatters, water scatters. This water and qi are like mother and child, never parting. The discerning eye sees only the qi, not the water. When this true Oneness Water unites with the heart’s upright Yang qi, this is called the Dragon and Tiger mating to transform into the Yellow Sprout, which becomes the Great Elixir.\n\nThe material of the Great Elixir fundamentally uses the true Oneness Water as its embryo, internally enclosing the upright Yang qi—just as in former days, the parents’ true qi, essence, and blood formed the embryonic sac. After three hundred days of transformation, the embryo is complete and the qi is full, the form and spirit fully prepared. The Embryonic Immortal resembles a millet grain, nurtured without deficiency. Initially, Yin retains Yang; next, Yang is used to refine Yin. Qi transforms into essence, essence into Mercury, Mercury into a pearl, the pearl into cinnabar, and cinnabar into the Golden Elixir. Once the Golden Elixir is achieved, true qi is naturally born. Refining qi into spirit, one attains transcendence, transforming into a Fire Dragon to emerge from the dark road, riding a Black Crane to enter the Peng Isle.\n\nLü said: \"Form uniting with form gives birth to form; qi uniting with qi gives birth to qi. The number does not exceed three hundred days. After the division of form, why do male and female appearances differ? And what is the color of one’s own cinnabar?\"\n\nZhong said: \"When the forms of father and mother unite, the father’s essence advances first, while the mother’s blood follows later. If blood envelops essence, a daughter is formed—internally Yang yet externally Yin, resembling the mother, for blood lies on the outside. If the mother’s blood advances first and the father’s essence follows later, with essence enveloping blood, a son is formed—internally Yin yet externally Yang, resembling the father, for essence lies on the outside.\n\nBlood, originating from the heart, lacks the true Yang qi. Essence, born of the kidneys, possesses the true Yang qi. This true Yang qi is the root of Mercury, the true Unity of Water. When harmonized, it enters the Yellow Court. Mercury is boiled in Lead’s decoction, while Lead is refined by Mercury’s fire. Without Mercury, Lead cannot transform into the pure Yang qi.\n\nLü said: \"Lead resides in the kidneys, generating the primordial Yang qi. Within this qi lies the true Unity of Water, invisible to the eye. When Lead obtains Mercury—Mercury being the true Yang qi—this true Yang qi refines Lead. As Lead’s generative qi flourishes, it uplifts the true Unity of Water, enabling ascent.\n\nYet Mercury, being the true Yang qi, is the true Unity of Water that forms the embryonic sac. Conveyed into the Yellow Court, it becomes the union of Dragon and Tiger, Yin and Yang in perfect balance. If boiled in Lead’s decoction, excess Yin dissipates the true Yang—how then can the Great Medicine arise, or qi generate qi within?\"\n\nZhong said: \"When kidney qi merges with heart qi, qi at its extreme generates fluid. Within this fluid lies the true Yang qi, which pairs with the true Unity of Water. This is called the Tiger’s union, yielding a grain as small as a millet—named the Golden Elixir, the Great Medicine—conveyed into the Yellow Court.\n\nThe Yellow Court lies below the spleen and stomach, above the bladder, north of the heart, south of the kidneys, west of the liver, and east of the lungs. Above it is clear, below turbid; externally, it corresponds to the four colors. Its capacity holds two *sheng*, its pathways connect to the eight waters. The Medicine obtained dwells within day and night. If one gathers the Medicine but fails to apply the fire, the Medicine will dissipate and cannot be retained. If one applies the fire but fails to gather the Medicine, the Yang within Yin cannot be preserved, merely arousing kidney qi to warm and strengthen the lower origin.\n\nIf the Medicine is gathered at the proper time and the fire applied in due measure, one must first borrow qi from Lead to stoke the fire, thereby solidifying the Great Medicine and permanently anchoring it in the lower field—this is the method of gathering and supplementation. Refining Mercury to replenish the cinnabar field prolongs life and enhances longevity, enabling one to become an Earth Immortal.\n\nIf, however, one gathers the Medicine and extracts primordial Lead from behind the elbow to fly the Golden Essence, once Lead is drawn, Mercury must be added. Without adding Mercury, merely returning essence to replenish the brain, how can true qi be generated? Without true qi, how can the Yang spirit be achieved? Once Mercury is added, Lead must be drawn. Without drawing Lead, merely refining Mercury to replenish the cinnabar field, how can cinnabar transform? Without this transformation, how can the Golden Elixir be achieved?\n\nLü said on extraction and supplementation: Gathering the Medicine relies on the water within qi, while applying the fire borrows the qi within Lead. Ultimately, extracting Lead forms the Great Medicine; supplementing with Mercury can then replenish the cinnabar field.\n\nWhat is the principle of extraction and supplementation?\"\n\nZhong said: \"In ancient times, the supreme sages transmitted the Dao to humanity. The people of the distant past were simple and unadorned, obscure and unknowing, unable to comprehend the Great Dao. Heaven and Earth illustrated Yin and Yang, the proper ascent and descent of their qi, exchanging warmth and cold, heat and chill, so that the seasons followed their course. A year’s cycle completed, it began anew, never deviating from the Dao—thus Heaven and Earth endure.\n\nNot content that people remained ignorant of the great principle, confined to a single corner, they likened it to the workings of the sun and moon’s essence, their advance and retreat governed by the times of dawn, fullness, waning, and new moon. Their rising and setting proceeded without error; a month’s cycle completed, it began anew, never deviating from the Dao—thus the sun and moon endure.\n\nYet as cold comes and heat departs, heat departs and cold returns, people fail to grasp the proper ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth’s qi. The moon waxes full, then wanes; people indulge in endless desires, squandering their limited time. Wealth and luxury, when tallied, merely adorn the fleeting dream of life. Love and sorrow, when all is said and done, become debts for the next life. Before the song ends, bitterness arrives; as fame and profit peak, youth fades.\n\nThose who covet wealth and goods believe it will endure for ten thousand kalpas. Those who dote on children and grandchildren hope to remain together forever. Ceaseless greed and delusion, the vain pursuit of immortality—all dissipate the primordial Yang and scatter the true qi. Only when grave illness clings to the body do they cease their striving; only when the final hour arrives do they bow their heads.\n\nThe true immortals and supreme sages, pitying their plight and seeing them sink into deep ruin, wished for people to awaken to the Great Dao. They first expounded the principle of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang, their ascent and descent, then likened it to the sun and moon’s essence, their advance and retreat.\n\nYet some, failing to grasp the celestial mechanism, misconstrue the mysterious and subtle, comparing inner medicine to outer medicine, speaking of the inanimate as if it were animate. The inanimate refers to metals and minerals—outer medicine. The animate refers to qi and fluids—inner medicine. The vastness of Heaven and Earth, the brightness of the sun and moon, outer metals and minerals, inner qi and fluids—once gathered, they must be supplemented; once supplemented, they must be extracted. The principle of extraction and supplementation is the foundation of creation.\n\nAfter the winter solstice, Yang ascends from the earth, which extracts its Yin. Greater Yin is drawn to become Terminal Yin; Lesser Yang is added to become Yang Brightness. Terminal Yin is drawn to become Lesser Yin; Yang Brightness departs to become Greater Yang. Without this, cold would not transform into warmth, nor warmth into heat.\"\n\nAfter the summer solstice, Yin descends from heaven, which extracts its Yang. Greater Yang is drawn to become Yang Brightness; Lesser Yin is added to become Terminal Yin. Yang Brightness is drawn to become Lesser Yang; Terminal Yin is added to become Greater Yin. Without this, heat would not transform into chill, nor chill into cold.\n\nThus, the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang give rise to the six qi, and this is the verification of extraction and supplementation. Just as the moon receives the sun’s essence and the sun transforms the moon’s spirit—during the first fifteen days, the moon extracts its spirit while the sun supplements its essence. Once the essence is full, its light illumines the earth below. Without this, there would be no waxing from new moon to first quarter, nor from first quarter to full moon. As the moon restores its Yin spirit and the sun withdraws its Yang essence—during the latter fifteen days—the sun extracts its essence while the moon supplements its spirit. Once its light fades and its Yin spirit is complete, there would be no waning from full moon to last quarter, nor from last quarter to new moon. Thus, the cyclical movement of the sun and moon gives rise to the nine and six, and this is the verification of extraction and supplementation.\n\nOrdinary people, failing to grasp the celestial mechanism and unable to fathom the profound principle, do not realize that the true immortals and highest sages—knowing that what the human heart cherishes is freedom from illness and longevity—refined metals and minerals into the great elixir. Knowing that what the human heart desires is gold and silver, they transformed lead and mercury into supreme treasures. Their original intent was to awaken the world to this great principle: even inanimate metals and minerals, when fired with precise timing and supplemented and extracted in measured cycles, can still prolong life and enhance vitality. How much more so, then, with the animate true Yang qi of one’s own body and the primordial water of the One, when one understands the moment of union and the method of gathering, accumulating day upon month, qi within qi, refining qi into spirit, and thus attaining liberation—this is a feat rare in all of history.\n\nYet few in the world attain such understanding. One must devote oneself wholeheartedly to practice, forsaking all external affairs, emulating the enduring constancy of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, and guiding deluded followers to turn their minds toward the Dao. Hence arose the discourse on outer medicine. Though sages and worthies of past and present have expounded these teachings, making them known to the world, people still fail to awaken. They deceive themselves and others, losing sight of the original intent of the ancient masters. They extract mercury from cinnabar, use mercury to transmute lead, dry lead with mercury, employ mercury to transform copper—heedless of their own lives, madly pursuing wealth, mutually praising one another under the pretense of cultivating the Dao, when in truth they covet profit and are fixated on the arts of gold and silver.\n\nThe ancient sages and immortals, compelled by circumstance, adapted their teachings to the capacities of beings, using lead and mercury as metaphors for inner alchemy. Lead and mercury, though derived from metals and minerals—lifeless substances—can still be transformed into treasure through the work of creation. How much more so, then, with the animate substances produced by one’s own body, which function like lead and mercury? Surely they, too, possess the power of creation. And if they possess such power, they are by no means inferior to those yellow and white substances.\n\nThose who uphold the Dao must delve deeply into this and not cling solely to external elixirs or the defense of elixir altars. Now, the lead within a person is the origin of Heaven and Earth, arising from the Great Beginning to form the Great Substance; it is the mother of the myriad things, emerging from the Great Substance to become the Great Simplicity. In its essence, it is metal within water; in its function, it is water within fire. It is the ancestor of the Five Phases and the root of the Great Dao. Thus, when gathering medicine, one supplements mercury, and to supplement mercury, one must extract lead—but this extraction of lead does not lie without. From the lower field it enters the upper field, called \"flying golden essence behind the elbow,\" or \"activating the river chariot to move dragon and tiger,\" or \"returning essence to replenish the brain and attain immortality.\"\n\nOnce lead is extracted afterward, mercury naturally descends from the middle. From the middle field it returns to the lower field, where dragon and tiger unite to transform into the yellow sprout. This is the inversion of the Five Phases. Thus, by extracting lead and supplementing mercury, one nurtures the immortal embryo—this is the reversal of the three fields. Without the inversion of the Five Phases, dragon and tiger do not unite; without the reversal of the three fields, the immortal embryo does not fill with qi. Extracting lead and supplementing mercury, after one hundred days the medicine’s power is complete; after two hundred days the sacred embryo is firm; after three hundred days the immortal embryo is perfected and true qi is born. Once true qi is born, refining qi into spirit, the work is fulfilled and form is forgotten—the immortal embryo transforms of itself, and this is called \"immortal.\"\n\nLü said: \"That which comes from metals and minerals is outer lead and outer mercury; through extraction and supplementation, it can become treasure. But that which arises from the true qi of one’s parents, stored in the kidneys, and becomes lead, and the medicine formed by the union of the true One and the correct Yang, transformed into mercury—through extraction and supplementation, can this generate spirit? Does true lead and true mercury also involve extraction and supplementation?\"\n\nZhong said: \"At first, one obtains mercury by using lead, but using lead is ultimately mistaken. Thus, one extracts it and enters the upper palace. The primordial qi is not transmitted; instead, essence returns to the brain. The mercury obtained daily, as Yin is exhausted and Yang is purified, transforms essence into cinnabar, and cinnabar into gold—this is called true lead. True lead is the true qi of one’s own body, obtained through union. True lead arises within true qi, the true water of the One within darkness. The five qi pay homage to the origin, and the three Yang gather at the crown. Formerly, golden essence descended into the cinnabar field, refined the form, and the body and bones took on a golden hue. Now, true lead ascends into the inner palace, and the body emits white light. From below to above, from above to below, returning the elixir and refining the form—all is the work of golden essence in cyclical movement. From front to back, from back to front, refining the body and merging qi—all is the work of true qi’s creation. Without extraction and supplementation, merely gathering medicine and advancing the fire in daily practice, how could such efficacy be achieved?\"\n\nLü said: \"In extracting and supplementing, how can one ensure that ascent and descent are measured, and front and back are without error?\"\n\nZhong said: \"When it is time to ascend, do not descend; when it is time to extract, do not supplement. In ascent and descent, there must be no deviation by even a hair’s breadth—this is the power of the river chariot.\"\n\n**On the River Chariot**\n\nLü said: \"What is this so-called River Chariot?\"\n\nZhong said: \"In ancient times, a man of will and wisdom observed how floating clouds could obscure the sun and thus fashioned a canopy to harness yin; how fallen leaves could drift upon the waves and thus devised a boat to bear objects; how tumbleweeds, borne by the wind, turned endlessly without cease—and from this, he created the chariot. Now, the chariot as an object embodies the image of heaven and earth, its wheels and hubs likened to the sun and moon. Advanced Daoists draw their analogy from the chariot. Yet while a chariot travels upon land and turns across the earth, the River Chariot has its own rationale. Within the human body, yang is scant and yin abundant, and where water prevails, the chariot takes its meaning from conveyance, while the river symbolizes the dominance of yin. Thus, this River Chariot does not move upon land but upon water. From above to below, now behind, now ahead, it is harnessed within the Eight Jewels’ domain and driven through the Four Seas. Ascending to heaven, it enters Kunlun; once the crossing is complete, it descends to the Phoenix Tower. It carries primordial yang straight into the Southern Palace, bears true qi in winding return to the Palace of Longevity, traversing the Nine Provinces without pause, patrolling the Three Fields without rest. When dragon and tiger unite, the Yellow Dame is driven into the Yellow Court; when lead and mercury part, the Metal Youth is conveyed into the Golden Palace. A thousand streams of Jade Spring are transported in but half a day’s work; a single flask of Golden Liquid is borne past in the time it takes to ask. Without this chariot’s conveyance, how could union be achieved? Following the seasons and responding to the nodes, one must rely on this chariot to bear the work—only then will efficacy appear. In nurturing yang and refining yin to establish the task, one must rely on this chariot to bear it—only then will there be no error. Before heaven and earth are purified, if yin and yang are to interact, it is the work of this chariot. Before the cosmos is complete, if qi and blood are to circulate, it is the work of this chariot. From without to within, it conveys the pure qi of heaven and earth to draw forth the primordial yang of one’s own palace. From the mortal to the sacred, it transports the true qi of yin and yang to refine and replenish the primordial spirit of one’s own body. Its merits cannot be fully recounted.\"\n\nLü said: \"The River Chariot has such wondrous uses—may I ask, in principle, what within the human body constitutes it? Once obtained, how is it employed?\"\n\nZhong said: \"The River Chariot arises from the true qi of the northern direction, the water’s center. The kidneys store true qi, and the upright qi born of true qi is called the River Chariot. Its workings are rarely heard of in past or present, for true immortals keep it secret and do not speak of it. When Qian twice seeks Kun and gives birth to Kan, Kan is fundamentally water, the essence of yin. Yang, having sought yin, returns bearing yin to restore its position, passing through Gen, Zhen, and Xun. With yang seeking yin and thereby drawing yin, it conveys yin into Li, where it receives yang and is born—this is the River Chariot bearing yin into the yang palace. When Kun twice seeks Qian and gives birth to Li, Li is fundamentally fire, the essence of yang. Yin, having sought yang, returns embracing yang to restore its position, passing through Kun, Dui, and Qian. With yin seeking yang and thereby drawing yang, it conveys yang into Kan, where it receives yin and is born—this is the River Chariot bearing yang into the yin palace. When medicine is gathered from the Nine Palaces above and brought down into the Yellow Court, when lead is drawn from the Winding River below and borne upward into the Inner Sanctum—Jade Liquid and Golden Liquid are the foundation of the returned elixir, and their conveyance refines the form, causing water to ascend. Sovereign Fire and People’s Fire are the basis of refining the form, and their conveyance fires the elixir, causing fire to descend. The Five Qi’s audience at the origin occurs at its appointed time; the Three Flowers’ gathering at the crown occurs on its appointed day. When spirits gather, demons multiply—bearing true fire to burn the body extinguishes the Three Corpses. When the medicine is complete and the sea runs dry, conveying the rosy nectar to bathe, one enters water without ripples. Such are the workings of the River Chariot.\"\n\nLü said: \"The River Chariot, born of the northern direction’s upright qi, turns without end, bearing and loading yin and yang, each with its own accomplishment—its labors are not uniform. I beg you, Master, to explain in detail.\"\n\nZhong said: \"The Five Phases circulate in return, endlessly revolving. To silently grasp the art of inversion, exchanging dragon and tiger to transform the Yellow Sprout—this is the Lesser River Chariot. Flying the Golden Essence behind the elbow, returning essence to the Mud Pill Palace, drawing lead and adding mercury to form the Great Medicine—this is the Greater River Chariot. If dragon and tiger exchange to transform the Yellow Sprout, if lead and mercury unite to form the Great Medicine, if true qi is born and the Five Qi pay audience at the Central Origin, if the yang spirit is perfected and the Three Spirits ascend to the Inner Sanctum—then the Purple Gold Elixir is complete, ever like a pair of soaring black cranes; the White Jade Mercury is settled, steadfast as a leaping fire dragon. A myriad golden rays envelop the mortal frame in radiance; a single jade tree blooms with fresh, resplendent blossoms. Whether emerging or entering, one moves freely; whether departing or arriving, one encounters no obstruction. Bearing the spirit into the body, one blends with the passing age; transforming the sacred and leaving the mundane, one becomes a feathered transcendent—this is called the Purple Chariot. These two chariots are distinguished by upper, middle, and lower accomplishments, thus called the Three Accomplishments. This refers to the verification of their efficacy, unlike the Three Vehicles of the Buddhist teachings—the Goat Cart, the Deer Cart, and the Great Ox Cart. In Daoist terms, beyond the River Chariot, there are three further chariots: When gathering fire and directing the mind with intent to attack illness, it is called the Daily Chariot. When the crossing is complete, from above to below, yin and yang unite in proper harmony, water and fire coexist, and in stillness one hears the sound of thunder—this is called the Thunder Chariot. If the mind becomes entangled in phenomena, the nature is enslaved by emotion, and one is moved by external things to scatter the true yang qi, dissipating it from within to without without cease—over time, qi weakens and the body declines, leading to aging. Or if the Eight Evils and Five Epidemics are borne inward, true qi and primordial yang cannot resist, and one grows old, falls ill, and dies—this is called the Broken Chariot.\"\n\nLü said: When the Five Phases invert and dragon and tiger unite, the Lesser River Chariot has already begun its course. When the Three Fields reverse and golden essence flies behind the elbow, the Greater River Chariot is about to commence. Yet when shall the Purple River Chariot be attained?\n\nZhong said: The cultivator of the Dao, having heard the Great Way and encountered an enlightened teacher, comprehends the principles of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, the cycles of the sun and moon’s coming and going. First, they harmonize yin and yang; next, they gather and disperse water and fire. Then, they gather the medicine and advance the fire, adding mercury and drawing forth lead—thus the Lesser River Chariot is surely set in motion. When golden essence from behind the elbow enters the crown, the great elixir of the Yellow Court gradually forms, striking through the Three Passes to ascend directly into the Inner Court, with the posterior rising and the anterior gathering, supplementing above and refining below—thus the Greater River Chariot is surely set in motion. Only after the golden and jade liquids return as the cinnabar elixir, refining the form, then refining qi, then refining spirit, and finally refining spirit to merge with the Dao—only then is the Dao accomplished, transcending the mortal realm to enter the ranks of immortals. At that time, it is called the Purple River Chariot.\n\n*The Fifteenth Scroll of Zhong-Lü’s Transmission of the Dao from the Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection concludes.*\n*The Sixteenth Scroll of Zhong-Lü’s Transmission of the Dao from the Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection.*\n\nMaster Zhongli Quan of Perfected Yang, styled Yunfang, records the discourse of Master Lü Dongbin of Perfected Yang, styled Yunpin, as collected by Master Shi Jianwu of Perfected Hua-Yang on the topic of the Returned Elixir.\n\nLü said: \"Refining form into qi, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit to merge with the Dao—these I dare not presume to comprehend. What, then, is meant by the Returned Elixir?\"\n\nZhongli replied: \"The so-called elixir is not a color; red and yellow cannot attain it. The so-called elixir is not a taste; sweetness and harmony cannot conjoin it. The elixir is the Cinnabar Field. There are three Cinnabar Fields: the upper field is the abode of spirit, the middle field the mansion of qi, and the lower field the chamber of essence. From essence arises qi, qi resides in the middle cinnabar, and from qi arises spirit, spirit abides in the upper cinnabar. True water and true qi conjoin to form essence, and the two essences reside in the lower cinnabar. All who uphold the Dao possess these three cinnabar fields. Yet, though qi is born in the kidneys, it has not yet ascended to the Central Origin; though spirit is stored in the heart, it has not yet transcended the Upper Court. This is what is meant by the essence-spirit’s failure to return and unite. Though one may possess the three cinnabar fields, they ultimately remain useless.\"\n\nLü said: \"Within the mysterious lies the even more mysterious. All people possess a destiny, yet if there is no essence within that destiny, it is not one’s own qi but the primal yang of one’s parents. Without essence, there is no qi; it is not one’s own spirit but the primal spirit of one’s parents. Essence, qi, and spirit are the treasures of the three fields—how then can they be made to abide perpetually within the three palaces of upper, middle, and lower?\"\n\nZhongli and Lü said: \"From the kidneys arises qi, and within qi lies the True One’s water. If this water returns to the lower cinnabar, essence nourishes the numinous root, and qi naturally arises. From the heart arises fluid, and within fluid lies the qi of Correct Yang. If this qi returns to the middle cinnabar, qi nourishes the numinous source, and spirit naturally arises. Gathering the numinous as spirit and merging spirit into the Dao to return to the upper cinnabar—only then is transcendence achieved.\"\n\nLü said: \"There are upper, middle, and lower cinnabar fields. To return is to go back to where one came from—hence the term Returned Elixir. The principle of the Returned Elixir is profound and subtle; pray, expound upon it in detail.\"\n\nZhongli said: \"There is the Lesser Returned Elixir, the Greater Returned Elixir, the Sevenfold Returned Elixir, the Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir, the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir, the Jade Liquid Returned Elixir, the elixir that returns the lower cinnabar to the upper, the elixir that returns the upper cinnabar to the middle, the elixir that returns the middle cinnabar to the lower, the elixir that returns yang to yin, and the elixir that returns yin to yang. These differ not only in name but also in the timing and method of their practice.\"\n\nLü said: \"What is the Lesser Returned Elixir?\"\n\nZhongli said: \"The Lesser Returned Elixir originates in the lower origin. The lower origin is the ruler of the five viscera and the root of the three fields. Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, and metal generates water—thus they mutually engender. There is no deviation in timing; when one should generate, it draws forth what has not yet been generated, like a mother’s love for her child. Fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, and water overcomes fire—thus they mutually overcome. There is no loss of measure; when one should overcome, it supplements what has not yet been overcome, like the union of husband and wife. Qi and fluid circulate in a cycle: from midnight to noon, yin and yang arise; from dawn to dusk, yin halts. In the span of one day and night, it returns to the lower cinnabar. Each cycle of return is called the Lesser Returned Elixir. Those who uphold the Dao gather the medicine and advance the fire to complete the lower cinnabar—this is the principle behind it.\"\n\nLü said: \"Now that the Lesser Returned Elixir is understood, what is the Greater Returned Elixir?\"\n\nZhongli said: \"When dragon and tiger conjoin, they transform into the yellow sprout; when lead is drawn and mercury added, the great medicine is formed. In the Palace of Dark Warrior, the golden essence first stirs; beneath the Mountain of Jade Capital, the true qi just ascends. The river chariot courses over the ridge, and the jade liquid irrigates the central thoroughfare. From the lower field it enters the upper field, and from the upper field it returns to the lower field. The posterior rises and the anterior gathers, completing the cycle—this is called the Greater Returned Elixir. Those who uphold the Dao arouse the dragon and tiger to soar as golden essence, nurture the immortal embryo to generate true mercury, and thus complete the middle cinnabar—this is the principle behind it.\"\n\nLü said: \"Now that the Greater Returned Elixir is understood, what are the Sevenfold Returned Elixir and the Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir?\"\n\nZhongli said: \"The numbers of generation and completion in the five phases total fifty-five. Heaven is one, earth is two; heaven is three, earth is four; heaven is five, earth is six; heaven is seven, earth is eight; heaven is nine, earth is ten. One, three, five, seven, and nine are yang, totaling twenty-five; two, four, six, eight, and ten are yin, totaling thirty. Beginning with the kidneys as water, the numbers of generation are: water one, fire two, wood three, metal four, earth five—these are the generating numbers of the five phases, three yang and two yin. Beginning with the kidneys as water, the numbers of completion are: water six, fire seven, wood eight, metal nine, earth ten—these are the completing numbers of the five phases, three yin and two yang. Within the human body, the Way of the five phases’ generation and completion is fully present. Water corresponds to the kidneys, which hold one and six; fire corresponds to the heart, which holds two and seven; wood corresponds to the liver, which holds three and eight; metal corresponds to the lungs, which hold four and nine; earth corresponds to the spleen, which holds five and ten. Each viscus possesses both yin and yang. Yin reaches its peak at eight and flourishes at two; thus, when qi arrives at the liver, the residual yin of the kidneys is exhausted, and when qi reaches the heart, the Supreme Ultimate generates yin, for two resides in the heart while eight resides in the liver. Yang reaches its end at nine and flourishes at one; thus, when fluid arrives at the lungs, the residual yang of the heart is exhausted, and when fluid reaches the kidneys, the Supreme Ultimate generates yang, for one resides in the kidneys while nine resides in the lungs. Those who uphold the Dao first conjoin dragon and tiger to gather the heart’s qi of Correct Yang—the qi of Correct Yang is the heart’s seven. Seven returns to the Central Origin and enters the lower field, nurturing the immortal embryo before returning to the heart—this is called the Sevenfold Returned Elixir.\"\n\nWhen the two and eight of yin dissolve, true qi arises and the heart is devoid of yin, thus severing the two; the Great Elixir is achieved and the liver is devoid of yin, thus severing the eight. Once the two and eight of yin dissolve, the nine and three of yang may flourish. When the liver severs its yang to assist the heart, it becomes three; the liver’s qi flourishes. When the seven returns to the heart, severing the lung’s fluid, and the lung’s nine revolves to assist the heart, the nine and three of yang flourish—this is the Ninefold Revolved Elixir.\n\nMaster Lü says: The Sevenfold Return refers to the heart’s yang returning to the heart and residing in the Central Elixir. The Ninefold Revolve refers to the lung’s yang, originally born of the heart, revolving and returning to the heart, also residing in the Central Elixir. Having understood the Sevenfold Return and Ninefold Revolve, what then is the meaning of \"golden fluid and jade fluid,\" the exchange among the upper, central, and lower fields, the interplay of yin and yang in the returning elixir?\n\nMaster Zhong says: Former worthies and ancient sages often spoke of lung fluid entering the lower field as the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir, and heart fluid entering the lower field as the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir. Though this discourse is not without subtlety, it does not fully reveal the profound mechanism. For the lung generates the kidneys—metal engenders water—yet how can metal entering water be called a returned elixir? The kidneys restrain the heart—water overcomes fire—yet how can water entering fire be called a returned elixir?\n\nThe golden fluid is the lung’s fluid. As the fetal sac, the lung’s fluid contains dragon and tiger, safeguarding and conveying them within the Yellow Court. When the Great Elixir nears completion, it is drawn from behind the elbow and ascends, the lung’s fluid entering the upper palace, then descending to the Central Elixir, and from the Central Elixir returning to the lower field—thus it is called the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir.\n\nThe jade fluid is the kidney’s fluid. Following the original qi upward to the Jade Pond, it scatters into blossoms of jade and refines into white snow. If it is gathered from the central field into the lower field when the elixir is present, it bathes the immortal embryo; if it is ascended from the central field into the four limbs to refine the form, it transforms the mortal bones. Neither ascending nor gathering, it circulates and returns—thus it is called the water of one, its water following yang to ascend, the yin returning as yang elixir. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born, and within yin resides the qi of Correct Yang; this qi follows yin downward—this is the yang returning as yin elixir.\n\nReplenishing the brain and refining the crown, the lower returns to the upper; completing the hexagram and irrigating, the upper returns to the center; firing the elixir and advancing the flame, the center returns to the lower; refining the body and incinerating the form, the lower returns to the center. The Five Phases invert, the Three Fields revolve, mutually exchanging until the form is transformed into qi, qi refined into spirit. From the lower field it ascends to the central field, from the central field to the upper field, from the upper field out through the Gate of Heaven, casting off the mortal frame to enter the ranks of sages and immortals—only then is the work of the Three Ascensions complete. From below to above, there is no further return.\n\nOn Refining the Form.\n\nLü said: \"Now that the returning elixir is understood, may I hear of the principle of refining the form?\"\nZhong replied: \"When a person is born, form and spirit serve as outer and inner, spirit being the master of form, form the dwelling of spirit. The essence within form generates qi, and qi generates spirit. From fluids arises qi, and from qi arise fluids—these are the mother and child within form. Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water; qi transmits between mother and child, fluids circulate between husband and wife—these are the yin and yang within form. Water transforms into fluid, fluid into blood, blood into essence, all born of yin receiving yang. If yin and yang are improperly balanced, then tears, mucus, saliva, and sweat issue uncontrollably, and yin loses its generative power. Qi transforms into essence, essence into pearl, pearl into mercury, mercury into cinnabar, all formed of yang receiving yin. If yin and yang are improperly balanced, then illness, aging, suffering, and death ensue, and yang cannot achieve completion. Without yang, yin cannot be born; without yin, yang cannot be completed.\n\nThose who follow the Dao cultivate yang but not yin, refine the self but not external things. At the inception of receiving qi in one’s own body, the true qi of father and mother unite to form essence and blood as the fetal sac, lodging the embryo within the mother’s purely yin palace. Yin generates yin, and through form, form is shaped. When the fetus is complete and qi is full, the six-foot frame is entirely yin, possessing but a single point of primordial yang. If one wishes for long life and immortality, refining the form to abide in the world and endure through eons; if one wishes to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood, refining the form into qi to attain a body beyond the body—\n\nLü said: \"Form is image, yin; yin has substance and engages in activity. To prevent form from transforming into qi and transcending the mortal frame to enter the ranks of sages is the supreme method of refinement. By preserving qi within form and nourishing form with qi, one achieves minor benefits of peace and longevity, and major benefits of preserving form to abide in the world. The aged return to youth, the not-yet-aged maintain their complexion and attain long life—three hundred and sixty years as one year, thirty-six thousand years as one kalpa, thirty-six thousand kalpas as one great kalpa. Through countless great kalpas, enduring as long as heaven and earth, such is the verification of refining the form.\n\nYet the principle of refining the form, the mechanism of creation and transformation, yields such verification—may I hear of it?\"\nZhong said: \"When a person’s form is complete, the fetus is perfected in three hundred days. After birth, qi is full in five thousand days. The five-foot-five-inch body corresponds to the generative numbers of the Five Phases. Variations in size are measured by inches, with length and proportion harmonized. Above the heart lies the Nine Heavens, below the kidneys the Nine Earths. From kidneys to heart is eight inches and four fen, from heart to the first ring of the *chonglou* eight inches and four fen, from the first ring of the *chonglou* to the crown eight inches and four fen. From kidneys to crown spans three feet and five inches two fen. The primordial qi fills this in one day and night through three hundred and twenty cycles, each cycle two feet and five inches two fen, totaling eighty-one zhang of primordial qi, corresponding to the pure yang number of nine nines.\n\nThe distance between heart and kidneys accords with the proper separation of heaven and earth. From kidneys to crown spans two feet and five inches, further aligning with the pure yang number of five fives in the Five Phases. Thus, primordial qi follows exhalation to exit. Upon exiting, the constructive and defensive qi all communicate with the upright qi of heaven and earth, responding to seasons and nodes, now uniting, now parting, their measure boundless, following inhalation to enter. Upon entering, the channels and network vessels all open. With each exhalation and inhalation, the true qi of heaven, earth, and humanity circulate before the Twelve Stories. One departure and one return constitute one breath. Between day and night, a person has thirteen thousand five hundred breaths. Dividing them, there are thirteen thousand five hundred exhalations—what is exhaled is one’s own primordial qi, issuing from within—and thirteen thousand five hundred inhalations—what is inhaled is the upright qi of heaven and earth, entering from without.\n\nIf the root is firm and primordial qi undiminished, between exhalation and inhalation one can seize the upright qi of heaven and earth. Refining qi with qi, it disperses to fill the Four Great Elements. The clear becomes constructive, the turbid defensive; all flow unimpeded. The vertical are channels, the horizontal network vessels; all attain ease and comfort. Cold and heat cannot harm, toil and hardship cannot threaten. The body is light, the bones sturdy, the qi fresh, the spirit clear. One eternally preserves boundless longevity and remains forever unaging. If, however, the root is not firm, essence exhausted and qi weakened, above the primordial qi is already depleted, below the original palace unsupplemented—then the qi of heaven and earth that is inhaled issues forth in great torrents. The eighty-one zhang of primordial qi diminish by nine nines, no longer belonging to oneself but instead taken by heaven and earth. How then can one seize the upright qi of heaven and earth? With accumulation, yin flourishes and yang declines, qi weakens and illness arises, qi exhausted and death follows, returning to the wheel of rebirth.\n\nLü said: \"How can primordial qi be prevented from dissipating, so that by refining the bodily form one may seize the upright qi of heaven and earth and endure through great kalpas?\"\nZhong said: \"To achieve victory, troops must be strong; for the people to be secure, the state must be prosperous. The troops are primordial qi. Internally, they dissolve the yin of bodily form; externally, they seize the qi of heaven and earth. The state is one’s own body. The tangible aspects of the body are abundant and ever in surplus; the intangible aspects are firm and never deficient. With ten thousand households open, none precede or follow—this is how one refines the substance and incinerates the body, now ascending, now descending, to nourish yang and dissolve yin. The firing of heaven and earth has its proper timing; can the forging of qi and fluids lack its daily regimen?\"\n\nWith jade liquid one refines the form, relying on the armored dragon to ascend and fly—white snow fills the dusty flesh. With golden liquid one refines the form, pursuing the thunder chariot to descend—golden light brims in the outer chamber.\n\nLü said: \"The principles of refining the form I now roughly understand. But what are golden liquid and jade liquid?\"\nZhong said: \"When refining the form with golden liquid, the bones assume a golden hue and the body emits golden light. Golden petals scatter in the void—this is when the five qi return to the origin, the three yang gather at the crown, the moment to transcend the mortal frame and the day the great golden elixir is accomplished. When refining the form with jade liquid, the flesh suffuses with yang’s cream, the body becomes like a jade tree, jasper flowers and jade herbs transform the mortal frame, and radiance dazzles the eye. Riding the wind, one soars freely, the form becoming qi. Though followers of the Dao may know the method of returning the elixir, the work of refining the form is no small matter.\n\nWhen the jade liquid returns the elixir to bathe the embryonic immortal, it ascends and moves, carried by the river chariot through the four great elements. It begins in the liver: the liver receives it, and at once light fills the eyes, making them dark as lacquer. Next the heart: the heart receives it, and the mouth produces numinous liquid that becomes white snow. Next the spleen: the spleen receives it, and the flesh becomes like congealed fat, all scars vanishing. Next the lungs: the lungs receive it, and the nose detects celestial fragrance, the complexion restored to youth. Next the kidneys: the kidneys receive it, returning it to its original palace—within the ears, the sound of strings and pipes is ever heard, and at the temples, the color of gray hair is forever banished. Such is the refining of form with jade liquid.\n\nAs for refining the form with golden liquid, it cannot be compared to this. When the elixir first returns but has not yet fully returned, it meets the sovereign fire in the hexagram *Already Across*. Once the elixir has returned and rises again, it contends with true yin in what is called *Refining the Substance*. Earth fundamentally overcomes water, yet when golden liquid is in earth, it causes the Yellow Emperor to turn his light back to unite with the Great Yin. Fire fundamentally overcomes metal, yet when golden liquid is in fire, it causes the Red Child to tend the furnace, spontaneously generating purple qi. Within water, fire arises; within yang, yin dissolves. The golden elixir transforms within the Yellow Court, refining the yang spirit amid the five qi. In the liver, green qi surges; in the lungs, white light appears; in the heart, red radiance manifests; in the kidneys, black qi ascends; in the spleen, yellow color emerges. The five qi return to the Middle Origin, following the sovereign fire to transcend the inner court.\n\nThe yang within the yin of the Lower Origin—its yang is without yin—ascends and gathers in the spirit palace. The yang within the yang of the Middle Origin—its yang is unborn—ascends and gathers in the spirit temple. The great medicine of the Yellow Court, with yin exhausted and pure yang remaining, ascends and gathers in the spirit palace. The five fluids return to the Lower Origin, the five qi return to the Middle Origin, the three yang return to the Upper Origin. Once the return to the origin is complete and the merit of three thousand [days] is fulfilled, now cranes dance within the crown, now dragons fly within the body. One hears the clear music of dawn, sees immortal blossoms raining down, lingers in the Purple Court, and inhales the rich fragrance of true incense. With three thousand merits fulfilled, one is no longer a person of the dusty world. As the incense in the censer burns away, one becomes a guest of Penglai and Yingzhou—this is what is called transcending the mortal to enter sagehood, shedding the form to ascend as an immortal.\n\n**On the Return to the Origin**\nLü said: \"The principles of refining the form I have now understood. May I hear of this *return to the origin*?\"\nZhong said: \"When the great medicine is nearly accomplished, the jade liquid returns the elixir to bathe the embryonic immortal. Once true qi is born, it rushes upward with the jade liquid to transform the dusty bones—this is called *refining the form with jade liquid*. Later, when golden essence flies up from behind the elbow and the river chariot enters the inner court, moving from above to middle, from middle to below, the golden liquid returns the elixir to refine the golden cinnabar. The five qi return to the origin, the three yang gather at the crown—this is refining qi into spirit, not merely refining the form to abide in the world.\n\nThe *return to the origin*—few in past or present have known it. Even if one knows, sages and worthies do not speak of it, for it is the method of true immortals’ great accomplishment, the subtle mechanism hidden in heaven and earth, the esoteric matter of the Three Clarities, the mysterious principle beyond words and images, the wondrous truth of no-question and no-response. I fear your resolve may not be steadfast, your study not single-minded, your heart not tranquil, your inquiry not earnest. Light words and casual speech would only bring upon me the fault of leaking sacred secrets, to the benefit of neither of us.\"\n\nLü said: \"At first, I awakened to true immortals and recognized the great Dao. Next, I understood the seasons and grasped the celestial mechanism. I distinguished the true sources of water and fire, knew that dragon and tiger do not arise from liver and lungs. I examined the great principles of withdrawal and addition, discerned that lead and mercury are not the same as Kan and Li. The art of inverting the five phases I have received your instruction in; the mechanism of reversing the three fields I have again thanked you for expounding. The principles of returning the elixir and refining the form I have thoroughly grasped; the method of immortality and deathlessness I deeply understand. Yet the origin of transcending the mortal to enter sagehood, the way of shedding the form to ascend as an immortal, lies in refining qi to return to the origin. May you deign to briefly reveal the essentials of this *return to the origin*?\"\n\nZhong said: \"The Dao is originally formless. When the great origin manifests simplicity, the Upper Clarity and Lower Turbidity unite as one. Once the great simplicity divides, the primordial chaos first separates into heaven and earth. Within heaven and earth, east, west, south, and north array the five directions. Each direction has its own emperor, each emperor has two children—one yang and one yin—called the two qi, which mutually generate and complete each other to form the five phases. The five phases mutually generate and complete each other to establish the six qi, called the three yin and three yang.\n\nBy this reasoning, when a person first receives the embryo, essence and qi are one. Once essence and qi separate, they lodge in the two kidneys. The left kidney is called *xuan*, *xuan* ascends qi and transmits it upward to the liver. The right kidney is called *pin*, *pin* receives fluid and transmits it downward to the bladder.\"\n\nThe *xuan* and *pin* originate from the midst of nothingness, transforming non-being into being. They are the true qi of father and mother, received into the realm of pure yin. Thus it is said: \"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the *xuan-pin*. The gate of the *xuan-pin* may be compared to the root of heaven and earth.\"\n\nThe *xuan-pin* are the two kidneys. From the kidneys arise the five viscera, and the six bowels are complete therein. Among them:\n- The liver is Wood, called *jia-yi*, comparable to the Azure Emperor of the east;\n- The heart is Fire, called *bing-ding*, comparable to the Vermilion Emperor of the south;\n- The lungs are Metal, called *geng-xin*, comparable to the White Emperor of the west;\n- The spleen is Earth, called *wu-ji*, comparable to the Yellow Emperor of the center;\n- The kidneys are Water, called *ren-gui*, comparable to the Black Emperor of the north.\n\nWhen a person is first born, there is no form or image—only one yin and one yang. Once the embryo is complete and the intestines and stomach form, the six qi divide into three yang and three yin.\n\nOne qi moves the five phases, and the five phases move the six qi. First, one must recognize yin and yang: within yang there is yang-within-yin, and within yin there is yin-within-yang. Next, one must recognize Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, wherein there is Fire-within-Water, Water-within-Fire, Metal-within-Water, Wood-within-Metal, Fire-within-Wood, and Earth-within-Fire. In humans, these mutually interact and combine, so the two qi divide into six qi, and the great Dao scatters into the five phases.\n\nAfter the winter solstice, when one yang arises, yang is born in the lands of the five directions. One emperor presides over its mandate, while the other four assist. If, after the spring mandate has taken effect, the Black Emperor does not withdraw his command, the cold cannot transform into warmth; if the Vermilion Emperor does not prepare his mandate, the warmth cannot transform into heat. After the summer solstice, when one yin arises, yin descends in the heavens of the five directions. One emperor presides over its mandate, while the other four assist. If, after the autumn mandate has taken effect, the Vermilion Emperor does not withdraw his command, the heat cannot transform into chill; if the Black Emperor does not prepare his mandate, the chill cannot transform into cold.\n\nAt the winter solstice, yang is born in the earth and pays homage to heaven with its qi. At the summer solstice, yin is born in heaven and pays homage to earth with its qi. Those who uphold the Dao must deeply investigate this principle.\n\nBetween the sun and moon, when one yang first arises, the qi of the five viscera pay homage to the Middle Origin. When one yin first arises, the fluids of the five viscera pay homage to the Lower Origin. Within yin there is yang, within yang there is yang, and within the midst of yin and yang there is yang—these three yang ascend to pay homage to the Inner Court. The spirit of the heart returns to the Heavenly Palace; all these are those who pay homage to the Origin.\n\nLü said: \"When yang arises, the five qi pay homage to the Middle Origin; when yin arises, the five fluids pay homage to the Lower Origin. If the yang-within-yang, the yang-within-yin, and the yang-within-the-midst-of-yin-and-yang ascend to pay homage to the Upper Origin, even those who cultivate this constantly—how can they transcend and escape the mundane world?\"\n\nZhong said: \"If one uses the primordial yang qi to ascend and pay homage to the Middle Origin at the time when one yang first arises, all people are like this. If one accumulates qi to generate fluids and descends to pay homage to the Lower Origin at the time when one yin first arises, all people are like this. If one practices in this way, one cannot transcend. Yet those who wish to transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood, to shed their form and ascend as immortals, must first unite dragon and tiger to form the Great Medicine. Once the Great Medicine is formed, true qi is born. When true qi is born, one uses the year to determine the month, the month to fix waxing and waning, the month to determine the day, the day to count the governing phase, the day to determine the hour, and the hour to fix the breath count.\n\nNurture yang with yang, ensuring no yin lingers within yang. Temper yin with yang, ensuring no yang scatters within yin. In spring, the liver is strong and the spleen weak; in summer, the heart is strong and the lungs weak; in autumn, the lungs are strong and the liver weak; in winter, the kidneys are strong and the heart weak. For humans, the kidneys are the root. In every season, the spleen is strong while the kidneys are weak—only the kidneys suffer harm in the four seasons. This is why people often fall ill.\n\nWhen *jia-yi* governs in the liver, guard against the spleen qi’s inactivity. When *bing-ding* governs in the heart, guard against the lung qi’s inactivity. When *wu-ji* governs in the spleen, guard against the kidney qi’s inactivity. When *geng-xin* governs in the lungs, guard against the liver qi’s inactivity. When *ren-gui* governs in the kidneys, guard against the heart qi’s inactivity. When one qi is abundant and another weak, one viscus flourishes while another declines—this is why people often fall ill.\n\nThe heart qi sprouts in *hai*, is born in *yin*, flourishes in *si*, and weakens in *shen*. The liver qi sprouts in *shen*, is born in *hai*, flourishes in *yin*, and weakens in *si*. The lung qi sprouts in *yin*, is born in *si*, flourishes in *shen*, and weakens in *hai*. The kidney qi sprouts in *si*, is born in *shen*, flourishes in *hai*, and weakens in *yin*. The spleen qi follows the liver in spring, the heart in summer, the lungs in autumn, and the kidneys in winter. People who do not understand daily practice do not know the times of growth, flourishing, strength, and weakness—this is why they often fall ill.\n\nWhen the three yang of the sun, moon, and hour gather, refine yang so that yin does not arise. When the three yin of the month, day, and hour gather, nurture yang so that yang does not scatter. Moreover, once true qi is born, use the pure yang qi to temper the qi of the five viscera without ceasing, bringing forth their original color. With one ascent, reach the Heavenly Pool.\n\nFirst, with the kidneys’ absence of yin, the Nine Rivers are without waves. Next, with the liver’s absence of yin, the Eight Passes are eternally sealed. Then, with the lungs’ absence of yin, Metal and Fire share a furnace. Next, with the spleen’s absence of yin, the Jade Gate does not open. Finally, the true qi ascends, and the four qi gather into one. Even if the Golden Fluid descends, a cup of water cannot overcome the fire of a cartload of kindling. Water and Fire embrace and unite as one to enter the Spirit Palace.\"\n\nStill the breath and turn the gaze inward, the mind undivided, spirit and consciousness both wondrous. In stillness, one constantly hears music—like a dream yet not a dream, as if dwelling in a realm of emptiness and nothingness. The scenery and vistas differ from the dusty world; their splendor and beauty surpass the mortal realm. Towers and palaces, jade-green tiles wreathed in mist, pearls and kingfisher feathers in brocade, fragrant incense forming ranks—at this moment, one is said to have transcended the Inner Court. Only then does the yang spirit gather and return to the Upper Cinnabar, refining the spirit to become an immortal and merge with the Great Dao.\n\nWith a single strike at Heaven’s Gate, the Dharma-body appears enveloped in golden light. Amidst the depths of blossoming flowers sits the mortal form, traversing the void as if walking a level plain, a thousand miles no farther than an outstretched arm. Should one return again to the original body, spirit and form unite, and their longevity equals that of heaven and earth. Should one grow weary of dwelling in the dusty world, one may lodge in a mortal womb and return to the Ten Isles, where at the Purple Mansion of the Supreme Tenuity, the True Lords verify one’s native place, compare names, and assess the merit of one’s deeds. One then dwells among the Three Islands, roaming forever beyond the wind and dust, a state called \"transcending the dust and shedding the mortal\"—superior to mere worldly existence.\n\nLü said: Refining the form only prolongs life in the world; refining qi alone enables ascent to immortality. Yet people fail to grasp the profound mechanism: without the elixir, they prematurely practice embryonic breathing, forcibly retaining it in the abdomen. Some accumulate frigid qi and fall ill; others stir false yang and invite disease. Though their practice aims at longevity, such delusion not only fails to prevent illness but may even cause it. They do not realize that once the Embryonic Immortal is achieved, true qi arises, and embryonic breathing follows naturally. Embryonic breathing refines qi; refining qi perfects the spirit. Yet refining qi requires careful attention to the month within the year, the day within the month, and the hour within the day. One must sit in a quiet chamber, free from worldly concerns and distractions. At this time, any lingering thoughts or attachments must be dispelled.\n\nBut if deluded thoughts persist, if wisdom leaks, if the aspiration for immortality wavers and the mind remains unsettled, what then is to be done?\n\nZhong said: Union has its proper time, practice has its proper method. Follow the time, enact the method, seek the Dao through the method, and success will come swiftly—easier than turning one’s palm. From ancient times to the present, those who have attained mastery close their eyes and still their hearts to enter the realm of the Inaudible and Invisible. Truly, through inward contemplation, the spirit and consciousness become free.\n\n**On Inward Contemplation**\n\nLü said: May I hear of the principle of inward contemplation?\n\nZhong said: The methods of inward contemplation, sitting in forgetfulness, and visualization were employed by some of the former worthies and sages but not by others. They feared the mind’s restlessness, like a monkey or a galloping horse, lest it be swayed by external things and lose its resolve. Thus, they established images within the void, rendering the ears unhearing, the eyes unseeing, the mind untroubled, and the will undisturbed. Visualization and inward contemplation in sitting forgetfulness are indispensable.\n\nYet how many ignorant beginners, unaware of the proper time for union or the methods of practice, cling to visualization in hopes of swift success, imagining the elixir forming within, \"gathering medicine\" in their thoughts, pounding the nose and swallowing with the mouth. They fixate on the tangible sun and moon, the formless heaven and earth, attempting to retain them in the abdomen—this is mere child’s play. Thus, the accomplished and extraordinary dismiss such practices, saying: \"Gaining wealth in a dream—how can it be of use? Drawing a cake on the ground—can it satisfy hunger?\" Empty within empty, like flowers in a mirror or the moon in water, such efforts ultimately come to nothing.\n\nYet there is merit in these methods: for those whose minds are easily stirred and whose single intent is hard to subdue, on a favorable day and at an auspicious hour, they may be adopted and applied. Though one may know of a place of purity, if the mind is enslaved by affairs and the will swayed by emotions, if time passes like lightning and every moment is precious, the slightest error may separate one from heaven and earth as far as the poles. Years and months may pass without progress—such failure stems from a scattered mind and a wild will.\n\nThe skilled painter, intent on the beauty of colors and ink, does not see Mount Tai; the skilled musician, intent on the sound of strings and bamboo, does not hear thunder. The functions of the ears and eyes are limited, yet even they can be so focused. How much more so the single mind, which roams the six directions and encompasses all things? At the moment of applying the method and seizing the time, can one refrain from using visualization and inward contemplation to achieve it?\n\nLü said: What, in broad terms, is the practice of visualization and inward work?\n\nZhong said: When yang ascends, one visualizes many things: a man, a dragon, fire, heaven, clouds, a crane, the sun, a horse, smoke, rosy clouds, a chariot, a carriage, flowers, qi—all such images are inward contemplations and visualizations corresponding to the ascent of yang.\n\nWhen yin descends, one visualizes many things: a woman, a tiger, water, earth, rain, a tortoise, the moon, an ox, a spring, mud, a boat, leaves—all such images are inward contemplations and visualizations corresponding to the descent of yin.\n\nThe Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior—since these names exist, their images must also exist. The Five Peaks and Nine Provinces, the Four Seas and Three Islands, the Golden Boy and Jade Maiden, the River Chariot and Towering Chambers—by naming and categorizing them, one cannot exhaust their descriptions. All are established as images within the void to stabilize the spirit and consciousness.\n\nBefore catching the fish, one must not discard the fish trap; before capturing the hare, one must not do away with the snare. When the rear carriage is about to move, it must follow the path of the one before it. Once the great vessel is completed, it becomes the model for those that follow. Thus, the method of inward contemplation is indispensable in practice.\n\nYet one must neither cling to it indefinitely nor abandon it in an instant—both extremes are to be avoided. If one cuts off all thoughts and enters a state of no-thought, this is true thought; true thought is true emptiness. In the realm of true emptiness, one gradually ascends toward the transcendent, leaving the dark paths of delusion and achieving liberation.\n\nAt the beginning of one’s practice, with daily progress, visualization may be employed. Moreover, as one diminishes daily in the pursuit of the Dao, entering the realm of the Inaudible and Invisible, the method naturally refines and recedes—all depends on inward contemplation.\n\nLü said: \"If one speaks of the union of dragon and tiger to pair yin and yang, what should the visualization resemble?\"\nZhong replied: \"At first, in coupling to harmonize yin and yang and stabilize Kan and Li, the visualization should be thus: the Nine August True Men lead a small boy in crimson robes upward, while the Nine August True Mothers guide a small girl in black robes downward. They meet before the Yellow Chamber. A yellow-robed old woman receives them, performing the rites of mortal marriage. When the union is complete, they rejoice; then the girl descends, the boy ascends, as if parting in the human world. Once finished, the old woman cradles an object shaped like a vermilion orange and casts it into the Yellow Chamber, where it is held in a golden vessel. This boy is Qian seeking Kun, his yang returning to its original place, yang bearing yin to reunite with its homeland. This girl is Kun seeking Qian, her yin returning to its original place, yin embracing yang to reunite with its homeland. This is what is meant by Kan and Li uniting to pair yin and yang.\n\nAlternatively, within raging flames, one may see a black tiger ascending, while in surging waves, a red dragon descends. The two beasts meet and battle before a towering pavilion. Crimson gates swing open, and amid billowing smoke and fire, a king gestures toward the sky-engulfing blaze, above which towering waves rise. Fire surges and recedes, smoke and flames filling heaven and earth. Dragon and tiger coil and retreat, entering a golden vessel, which then descends into the Yellow Chamber, as if placed within a gilded cabinet. Such is the visualization of the dragon and tiger’s union transforming into the yellow sprout.\n\nLü said: \"The pairing of yin and yang through the union of dragon and tiger—now that I understand the inward contemplation and visualization—what of the method of advancing the fire to refine the elixir? What should the visualization be?\"\nZhong replied: \"The visualization is thus: a vessel like a tripod or cauldron, either yellow or black, shaped like a wheel. To its left is the Azure Dragon, to its right the White Tiger; before it the Vermilion Bird, behind it the Dark Warrior. Flanking it stand two ministers in purple robes, bowing and holding jade tablets. Attendants and officials feed firewood to the vessel. Then a king in crimson robes, riding a red horse and driving fiery clouds, descends from the sky. He brandishes his whip, shouting, fearful the flames are too small. Fire blazes fiercely, filling the void, striking the heavens but unable to break through. The smoke and flames descend again, swirling on all sides. The vessel, the people, the king, and his ministers—all are enveloped in crimson flames, gesturing and calling to one another, vying to advance the fire. The water within the vessel, though without vapor, seems congealed; the pearl within the water, though without darkness, shines with radiance. Such is the visualization of advancing the fire to refine the elixir.\n\nLü said: \"Inward contemplation and visualization—do they cease with the gathering of medicine and advancing of fire, or do they persist through subsequent methods and practices?\"\nZhong replied: \"Thunder rumbles as lightning descends, smoke and flames rise. Heaven rains rare blossoms, auspicious winds and propitious vapors arise in the palace courtyard. Jade maidens and immortal maidens ride colorful phoenixes and auspicious simurghs down from the azure heavens, bearing golden trays of jade dew and rosy nectar to offer the king. Such is the visualization of the golden liquid returning elixir, the state of perfect completion.\n\nAlternatively, dragon and tiger pull a chariot through fire, surging upward through the Three Passes. At each pass stand countless armed guards, fearful of intruders. First, dragon and tiger charge but fail to open them; only when great fire burns them do the gates swing wide. The ascent continues without pause until reaching the Heavenly Pool. Or three cranes pierce the three heavens; or twin butterflies enter the three palaces; or within five-colored clouds, a small boy in crimson robes is borne past the Gate of Heaven; or a golden chariot with jade linchpins carries a king beyond the Three Realms. Such is the visualization of the flying golden essence behind the elbow, the Great River Chariot.\n\nThen a crimson-robed messenger rides a chariot, traveling in sequence: from Ji Province to Yan and Qing Provinces, from Qing to Xu Province, from Xu to Yang Province, from Yang to Jing Province, from Jing to Liang Province, from Liang to Yong Province, and from Yong back to Ji Province—east, west, south, and north, completing the circuit in Yu Province before resuming the journey. What is gathered are gold and jade; what is accomplished is the congealing of stagnation. A single official transmits the decree, and the Nine Provinces are harmonized. The cycle repeats endlessly, ceaselessly circulating. Or one may wander the Five Peaks, beginning at Mount Heng; or sail the Five Lakes, starting at the Northern Marsh; or receive celestial decrees summoning the Five Emperors; or issue royal commands to the Five Marquises. Such are the visualizations of the returning elixir.\n\nThen pearls and jade scatter upon the earth; or rain and dew nourish all things; or the sea tide fills the hundred rivers; or yang arises and stirs the myriad beings; or fire blazes across heaven and earth; or mist and haze fill the cosmos. Such are the visualizations of refining the form.\n\nThen, like a crane leaving its nest, or a dragon emerging from the celestial vault; or the Five Emperors paying court to Heaven; or five-colored clouds rising; or riding a cinnabar phoenix through the azure void; or ascending the celestial thoroughfare as if in a dream; or heavenly blossoms raining down amid celestial music, golden light swirling into palaces of splendor—such are the visualizations of audience with the Origin.\n\nAfter audience with the Origin, visualization ceases, and this is truly called inward contemplation.\n\nLü said: \"The profound principle of inward contemplation differs from earlier methods—may I hear of it?\"\nZhong replied: \"From ancient times to the present, those who cultivate the Dao yet fail to grasp the celestial mechanism begin without understanding. They follow the method in practice, seeking swift liberation. They take in much but release little, practicing fetal breathing, calming the mind and closing the eyes to engage in inward contemplation. They remain fixed in quiescence, producing a yin spirit—a clear and numinous ghost, not a pure yang immortal.\"\n\nTrue immortals and supreme sages, in their quest to gather the medicine, advance the fire, withdraw lead and add mercury, return the elixir and refine the form, achieve audience with the Origin and merge with the primordial, have spoken in earnest and explained in detail—ever fearful that the world might not awaken—yet have scarcely attended to the method of inward contemplation. Little do they realize that inward contemplation is the method of yin-yang transformation, the moment when immortal and mortal exchange places. Those who follow the Dao must not treat it lightly or employ it trivially.\n\nMoreover, the preceding practices—union and interaction—occur at appointed times, and their execution follows established principles. If one diligently adheres to discipline, maintains unwavering faith, and practices in accord with the proper timing without the slightest deviation, results may be seen in due course. But inward contemplation knows neither fixed hours nor set procedures. Secluded in a chamber of profound stillness, one sits upright day and night, recognizing the yang spirit and driving out the yin ghosts. Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years before transcending the inner court; the World-Honored One meditated in darkness for six years before emerging from the mortal cage. Thus, inward contemplation is truly a difficult endeavor.\n\nAt first, the process moves from above downward: the purple river chariot carries one into the celestial palace. Who would not admire the wealth and honor of the heavenly realm? One may come and go, indulging in its splendor and extravagance—experiencing all that mortals never see. Those who cultivate the Dao, having long endured simplicity and solitude, may, when their merit reaches sufficient measure, be overwhelmed by such pleasures. Towers adorned with pearls and jade, women’s music and reed pipes, rare delicacies and exotic feasts, strange herbs and wondrous birds—all unfold like a painted scroll before the eyes. Yet if one fails to awaken, mistaking the inner court for the true celestial palace, one may linger there, believing the dim thoroughfare to be the heavens. Thus, the body remains bound to the world, unable to shed its form and become a spirit immortal. Only when one has not yet reached the celestial palace does one remain in inward contemplation.\n\nYin ghosts and external demons arise from the mind, taking shape from images and manifesting as demonic armies. If the cultivator becomes reckless and strays into delusion, or loses themselves to heterodox paths, they will never attain immortality. For the three corpses and seven poisons desire only the practitioner’s death to secure their own pleasure, while the nine worms and six thieves suffer when the practitioner is at peace, finding no place to abide.\n\n**On Demonic Obstacles**\nLü said: \"Inward contemplation gathers the yang spirit; refining the spirit transcends the inner court; leaping upward exits through the celestial gate, directly ascending to the ranks of immortality. Once one has exited and entered without error, coming and going without misstep, near or far as one wishes—if one desires to remain in the world, spirit and form unite; if one seeks to ascend as an immortal, one may wander to the distant Penglai Isles. If this is so, and after fulfilling the three thousand merits one achieves liberation through inward contemplation, how then do yin ghosts and demonic forces obstruct the cultivator’s ascent to immortality?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"When a cultivator first embraces faith, worldly attachments—love, fame, profit, and all mundane toils—must not sway their great resolve. Next, they must endure hardship with diligent perseverance, remaining unmoved by all ethereal and empty states, never altering their original intent. If one’s resolve is to achieve great completion but one settles for middling success, or aims for middling completion but stops at minor attainment—how much more so for those who do not comprehend the great Dao, who fail to grasp the celestial mechanism, who practice minor arts and favor heterodox methods? Time slips by, and no progress is seen. In old age, they decline and reenter the cycle of rebirth, leading later seekers of the Dao to dismiss longevity as a delusion and liberation as empty talk. Though some may hear the teaching, they do not believe it; even if their hearts believe, they lack the resolve to endure. Confronted by circumstances, their minds waver; encountering worldly things, their aspirations falter. Thus, they never escape the nine trials and ten demonic obstacles.\"\n\nLü said: \"What are the nine trials?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"Before the great medicine is complete, one must endure cold and heat—throughout the year, clothing is needed for each season. Before true qi is born, hunger and thirst persist—throughout the day, three meals are required. For the cultivator, the pressing need for clothing and food is the first trial.\n\nFurthermore, if one’s karmic debt from past lives is heavy, it must be repaid in this existence. Even when stealing moments of leisure amid busyness, one remains bound by the constraints of elders. Daily, one cannot bear to abandon family obligations for undisturbed practice. For the cultivator, the obstruction of elders is the second trial.\n\nMoreover, those one loves—wife and children—and those one cherishes—parents—entangle one in bonds of affection and emotion, which grow daily. The household, like a cart of sorrows, never ceases its turning. Though one may harbor a heart for purity and simplicity, it is hard to withstand the onslaught of cares and vexations. For the cultivator, the entanglement of love and attachment is the third trial.\n\nFurthermore, those who possess vast wealth or hold high office cannot rest their restless minds; the greedy are ever anxious over insufficiency. For the cultivator, the snare of fame and profit is the fourth trial.\n\nMoreover, if in youth one refuses to cultivate restraint, weakness of qi may lead to illness, or a stubborn heart may prevent awakening. Karmic retribution may bring disaster, and one may suffer in this very life, serving as a warning to others. For the cultivator, the sudden onset of calamity is the fifth trial.\n\nFurthermore, when one recognizes that the matter of life and death is paramount and urgently seeks a teacher, one may fail to discern the true from the false—following one with eloquent speech or another with an austere demeanor. At first, one may believe they have encountered an immortal, only to later realize they have fallen in with a profiteer. For the cultivator, the constraint of a blind teacher is the sixth trial.\n\nMoreover, blind teachers and reckless companions may point to side doors, plucking branches and leaves without ever grasping the root. Minor arts and heterodox methods are passed among them, each claiming secret knowledge. Yet they do not understand that the sun and moon do not shine until they emerge—then their brilliance is seen by all. Thunder does not roar until it strikes—then its might is heard by all. But these, with their flickering firelight and the croaking of well-frogs, their dim murmurs and chatter—how could they ever align with the true Dao?\"\n\nThe cultivator of the Dao must also guard against the seventh trial: the confusion of divergent doctrines. There are those who alter their path from morning to night, who forget their seated practice upon standing, who delight in fleeting moments yet grow weary of perseverance, who begin with diligence but end in slackness. This is the eighth trial: the wavering of will and the slackening of intent.\n\nThen there are those who lose the year within the span of a season, the month within the span of a day, the hour within the span of a moment—while the young remain entangled in thoughts of fame and profit, and the old linger over concerns for children and grandchildren. Time is finite: do not say, \"This year has passed, I shall wait for the next,\" nor, \"Today is done, I shall wait for tomorrow.\" Today does not guarantee tomorrow, and old age can never reclaim youth. This is the ninth trial: the squandering of years and months.\n\nOnly by overcoming these nine trials may one truly walk the Dao. If even one or two remain unmastered, all effort will be in vain, and success will never be attained.\n\nLü said: \"Now that the nine trials are known, may I hear of the ten demons?\"\nZhong said: \"The ten demons fall into three categories: first, those manifest in the external world; second, those arising in dreams; and third, those encountered in inner contemplation.\n\nWhen the eyes are dazzled by blossoms, the ears filled with music, the tongue savoring sweetness, the nose drawn to rare fragrances, the heart swayed by ease, and the spirit soaring—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of the six thieves.\n\nWhen one beholds jade towers and jeweled pavilions, painted beams and carved rafters, pearl curtains and embroidered drapes, orchid chambers and coral-strewn floors, halls overflowing with gold and jade—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of wealth.\n\nWhen one sees golden saddles and priceless steeds, stately canopies, enfeoffment of ten thousand households, imperial banners and insignia, gates lined with officials in purple, and forests of fine boots—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of nobility.\n\nWhen one witnesses drifting mists and balmy days, violent storms and crashing thunder, radiant music and mournful wails—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of the six emotions.\n\nWhen one encounters the suffering of kin, the misfortune of family, the illness of children, the death of parents, the separation of siblings, the estrangement of wives and concubines—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of love and attachment.\n\nWhen one faces peril in fire or heights, harm from venomous creatures, poisoning, encounters with brigands, execution for crimes, or the torment of poverty—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of hardship.\n\nWhen one beholds the ten stages of enlightenment, the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Four Spirits and Seven Luminaries, the Five Peaks and Eight Kings, their majestic processions and celestial flights—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of sages and worthies.\n\nWhen one sees armies massed with gleaming blades, spears and bows at the ready, warriors clashing in deadly combat—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of warfare.\n\nWhen one is surrounded by fairy maidens in rows, their music resounding, their rainbow skirts swaying, their crimson sleeves offering golden cups—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of sensual pleasure.\n\nWhen one is tempted by beauties in alluring attire, their jade forms lightly clad, their flirtatious manners vying for affection—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of lust.\n\nThese are the ten demons. Failure to recognize them is the danger; recognition leads to attachment, and attachment to fixation. This is why so many fail to attain the Dao.\n\nFor the cultivator who does not cling to external illusions, the heart remains steadfast and the will unshaken. In dreams, if one neither recognizes nor attaches to visions, the spirit remains clear and the soul undispersed. In inner contemplation, when such apparitions arise, one must discern their emptiness and test their truth. One may ride the waves of illusion, but if they mistake the thief for their child, they must swiftly ignite the true fire of samadhi to burn away the self. With a single stroke, the demons scatter, and the purple river chariot carries their yang spirit beyond the inner court, returning to the celestial palace—only then may they seek liberation.\n\nNow and in ages past, those who love the Dao often begin with pure resolve, yet when confronted with circumstances, their will falters. They may escape the dust of the world, dwell in seclusion far from the mundane, and dedicate themselves to the mysteries of the Dao, yet if they fail to overcome all nine trials or succumb to even one or two of the ten demons, they may not attain the full Dao—but they may achieve partial or minor realization, ascending as human or earthly immortals.\n\nOnly by fully dispelling the demons and trials, progressing through the stages of verification step by step, and uniting the inner vision with the yang spirit, can one ascend to the Three Isles in due time.\"\n\n**On Verification**\nLü said: \"The averse fear illness, yet those who love the Dao seek freedom from illness and lasting peace. The fearful dread death, yet those who love the Dao desire immortality and eternal life. While the world remains bound to the earthly realm, those who love the Dao aspire to ascend as immortals and wander beyond the material. While the world toils on the ground, those who love the Dao strive to transcend the mortal and enter the grotto-heavens. Thus, they endure hardship and embrace poverty, their hearts roaming in purity and ease, dwelling in seclusion amid wilderness and desolation. They persist in their practice, unaware of the depth of their merit, the shifts in their method, or the timing of their transformation. After such effort, what is the sequence of verification?\"\n\nZhong said: \"Those who endure hardship yet see no progress do not suffer because the Dao has failed them, but because they did not follow an enlightened teacher and received no true method. Those who practice the method yet see no progress do not suffer because the Dao has failed them, but because they did not grasp the proper timing and thus failed to succeed.\n\nBut if one has met an enlightened teacher, received the true method, and practices the great method in accord with the proper time—how could verification not follow?\"\n\nLü said: \"Does the method have a fixed number? Does the proper time have a fixed measure?\"\n\nZhong said: \"The method comprises twelve divisions: the first is the matching of yin and yang; the second, the gathering and scattering of water and fire; the third, the union of dragon and tiger; the fourth, the firing and refining of the elixir; the fifth, the flying of golden essence behind the elbow; the sixth, the return of jade liquid as elixir; the seventh, the refining of form with jade liquid; the eighth, the return of golden liquid as elixir; the ninth, the refining of form with golden liquid; the tenth, the refining of the black through audience with the origin; the eleventh, the inner observation of transformation; the twelfth, the liberation and division of form.\n\nAs for the proper time, it follows the yearly ascent and descent of heaven and earth’s yin and yang, the monthly cycles of the sun and moon’s movements, and the daily divisions of the four cardinal directions, eight trigrams, ten celestial stems, twelve earthly branches, one hundred marks, and sixty minutes. When the method is practiced in accord with these divisions, from the first day onward, the sequence of verification proceeds without the slightest deviation until the transcendence of the mortal frame and ascension as an immortal.\n\nAt first, lewd and deviant thoughts cease entirely, and external practices are cultivated alongside the gathering of medicine. Next, golden essence fills the heart’s realm, naturally dispelling the yin marsh’s loach as it surges upward through the heart meridian, and sweet liquid appears in the mouth. Then, yin and yang strike and clash, and the sound of wind and thunder is heard within the abdomen. Next, the hun and po become unsettled, and dreams are filled with fearful and startling visions. Then, the six bowels and four limbs may develop minor ailments, which heal without treatment. Next, the cinnabar field grows warm at night, and the countenance appears clear and refined by day. Then, in darkness, the eyes emit a divine radiance. Next, in dreams, one becomes bold and fearless, untouchable by harm or deceit, or one may dream of holding a returned infant. Then, the golden barrier and jade lock seal firmly, preventing nocturnal emissions and leakage. Next, a thunderous roar sounds, the joints open and connect, and startled sweat flows in all directions. Then, jade liquid is simmered and rinsed, congealing into butter. Next, the numinous liquid thickens into a paste, and one gradually develops an aversion to rank and foul odors, filling the mouth and stomach. Then, the mortal bones grow light and transform into a divine chamber; one’s steps outpace a galloping horse, and movement becomes as swift as flight. Next, when facing external phenomena, the mind remains detached, and cravings and desires cease. Then, true qi enters objects and can cure others’ illnesses. Next, inner observation becomes clear and unobscured. Then, the pupils of the eyes become as dark as lacquer, wrinkled skin smooths and rejuvenates, and gray hair regrows; those who were aged retain a youthful appearance. Next, true qi gradually becomes abundant, and one feels perpetually sated, eating little yet drinking wine without limit and never becoming drunk. Then, the body grows lustrous, the spirit radiant and refined; the sacred elixir produces flavor, the numinous liquid emits fragrance, and true fragrance and rare tastes linger between mouth and nose, perceptible to others. Next, one’s gaze can discern the finest details at a hundred paces. Then, old scars and blemishes on the body naturally fade, and tears, saliva, and sweat no longer appear. Next, the fetus is complete and qi is full, eliminating the need for food and drink. Then, the inner will becomes lofty and aligns with the Great Void; worldly emotions and attachments vanish from the heart, the nine worms are eradicated below, and the three corpses die above. Next, the hun and po no longer wander, and dreams cease; the spirit’s clarity remains constant, day and night. Then, yang essence forms the body, the divine palace becomes firm, and the four limbs are unaffected by cold or heat. Next, life and death can no longer interfere; in seated forgetfulness and inner observation, one roams the divine immortal realm of Huaxu, where towers of female musicians, pavilions, and resplendent beauty surpass anything in the mortal world. Then, when merit is complete and conduct is fulfilled, karmic retribution manifests; the Three Clarities secretly bestow the true record, and one can foresee the transformations of yin and yang, predict human affairs, and perceive disasters and blessings in advance. Next, the dust and clutter of the world become wearisome; one purifies the body and dwells in stillness, and the fetal immortal appears—an external body emerges alongside the original, marking one as a divine sage. Then, true qi becomes purely yang, and exhalations can dry external mercury. Next, the fetal immortal constantly desires to ascend, and auspicious light arises in the bedchamber. Then, in stillness, one often hears celestial music. Next, when facing ordinary people—even the wealthy and noble—one detects the stench of their mortal bones and vulgar bodies. Then, the spirit’s radiance can transform at will; one’s bearing becomes refined, and one’s immortal countenance rivals a jade tree, while a golden hue shines through the extraordinary bones. Next, wherever one goes, divine spirits naturally appear to pay homage, obeying commands as if by one’s own will. Then, in stillness, one gazes outward to see purple clouds filling the eyes; looking downward from the crown, a golden light envelops the body. Next, within the body, a fire dragon suddenly takes flight, or a dark crane ascends—this is the spirit’s liberation from mortal bones, transcending the vulgar world, called *liberation*. Then, after liberation, colorful clouds swirl, auspicious vapors abound, heaven rains rare flowers, dark cranes fly in pairs, and extraordinary fragrance scatters as jade maidens descend to bestow celestial scriptures and purple decrees. Once complete, the attire of an immortal—crown, robes, and all—is fully prepared, along with the regalia and dignity of command, too numerous to recount. Escorted and guided, one returns to Penglai, where in the Purple Palace one pays audience to the Supreme Subtle True Lord. After verifying one’s original name and assessing the degree of merit, one resides on the three islands as a *zhenren* or immortal being.\"\n\nLü said: \"Today, I have been specially favored by your honor’s exposition of the profound principles of the abstruse and the celestial mysteries of heaven and earth. Not only have my ears and eyes become clear, and my spirit radiant and refined, but this decaying body now has a refuge—it will no longer share the fate of dust and dirt. Yet those who know may not necessarily practice, and those who practice may not necessarily succeed. Considering the gravity of life and death and the swift passage of time, even if one knows the wondrous principles, failure to practice renders it no different from ignorance. I humbly ask for instruction on the timing of convergence and the method of practice: how to begin, and how to apply effort?\"\n\nZhong said: \"I possess the *Lingbao Bifa*, comprising ten scrolls and twelve divisions, which includes six forms of instruction: the first is the *Golden Edict*; the second, the *Jade Scripture*; the third, the *True Origin*; the fourth, the *Analogies*; the fifth, the *True Secrets*; and the sixth, the *Essentials of the Dao.\"\n\nEncompassing the great Dao, it draws analogies from the Three Clarities, taking the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang as its model, and the cyclical movements of the sun and moon’s essence as its principle. It truly points to the aims of the Five Immortals and serves as the standard for the Three Attainments. The text shall be conferred upon you on an auspicious day.\n\n*The Sixteenth Scroll of the Ten Books on Cultivating the True, \"The Transmission of the Dao from Zhongli Quan to Lü Dongbin,\" concludes.*",

      "translated_text": "*The Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection*\n*Title: The Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection*\n*Sixty scrolls, unattributed, likely dating to the Yuan dynasty.*\n*Source text: \"Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era,\" Dongzhen Section, Methods Category.*\n\n*Scroll Fourteen of The Ten Books of Cultivating Perfection: The Transmission of the Dao from Zhong-Lü*\n*Recorded by Pure Yang Perfected Immortal Zhongli Quan (Yunfang), Enlightening Pure Yang Perfected Immortal Lü (Dongbin) of Mount Yanxia, Transmitted by Hua Yang Perfected Immortal Shi Jianwu (Xisheng)*\n\n**On True Immortals**\n\nLü said: When a person is born, how can one live without illness, remain vigorous without aging, and exist without dying? By what Dao can this be achieved?\n\nZhong said: Human life begins when father and mother unite, and the two qi converge, forming essence and blood into the fetal sac. After the Great Beginning, there arises the Great Substance. Yin receives and Yang generates; qi follows the transformation of the fetus. After three hundred days, the form is complete, and the numinous light enters the body, separating from the mother. After the Great Simplicity, there is already ascent and descent. The yellow sprout grows, and after five thousand days, the qi reaches its full measure—eighty-one zhang in total—only then, at the age of fifteen, is one called a \"youthful boy.\" At this time, Yin is half within Yang, comparable to the light of the setting sun. Beyond this, one loses primordial Yang, dissipates true qi, and when qi weakens, illness, death, and extinction follow. Through a lifetime of ignorance, one harms one’s own numinous light, lives a life of misfortune and stubbornness, and dimly exhausts one’s allotted lifespan. Thus, in the next life, the body differs in rank, and lifespans vary in length. Having been born, one perishes; having perished, one is reborn, turning endlessly without awakening, life after life falling into degradation. One loses the body to other species, the spirit to different shells, and the root-nature of utmost truth no longer returns to humanity. Wandering the byways of the Dao, one is forever without liberation. If one encounters a true immortal or perfected being who dissolves one’s karmic retribution, sheds the skin and discards the shell, and regains a human body, one remains in a state of stupor, muteness, and ignorance. After accumulating merit for a hundred kalpas, one ascends to a blessed realm, yet still suffers hunger, cold, and lingering afflictions. Gradually advancing, one slowly regains a complete form, yet still dwells among slaves and servants in lowly stations. If one then commits further transgressions, it is like a ball rolling down a plank—one re-enters the byways of the wheel of rebirth.\n\nLü said: Born in the Middle Kingdom, fortunate to live in an age of peace, with clothing and food somewhat sufficient and time not yet too late—those who love are at ease, while those who resent fall ill; those who covet live, while those who fear die. Today, having met my revered teacher, I bow again and again, entreating you: considering that the matter of life and death is of utmost importance, might you deign to expound the principle of being without illness or death, and instruct this poor scholar?\n\nZhong said: If one wishes to avoid the turning wheel of rebirth and not enter the shells of other species, one should ensure that the body is free from the suffering of illness, aging, and death—standing between heaven and earth, embracing Yin and holding Yang, thus being human. As a human, one should not become a ghost; among humans, one cultivates to become an immortal; among immortals, one ascends to become celestial.\n\nLü said: When a person dies, they become a ghost; when the Dao is accomplished, one becomes an immortal. Immortals are of one kind—why then do you speak of ascending from immortals to become celestial?\n\nZhong said: Immortals are not of one kind. Those who are purely Yin without Yang are ghosts. Those who are purely Yang without Yin are immortals. Those in whom Yin and Yang are mixed are humans. Only humans can become ghosts or immortals. If in youth one does not cultivate but indulges the passions and follows the will, one falls ill and dies, becoming a ghost. If one awakens and cultivates, transcending the ordinary and entering sageliness, one sheds the mortal form and becomes an immortal. Immortals have five ranks, and the methods have three degrees of accomplishment. Cultivation depends on the individual, and the fruition of merit follows one’s allotted portion.\n\nLü said: You say the methods have three degrees of accomplishment, yet immortals have five ranks—why is this?\n\nZhong said: The methods have three degrees of accomplishment: small accomplishment, middle accomplishment, and great accomplishment—each different. Immortals have five ranks: ghost immortals, human immortals, earth immortals, spirit immortals, and celestial immortals—all are immortals, yet not equal. Ghost immortals do not depart from ghosts; human immortals do not depart from humans; earth immortals do not depart from earth; spirit immortals do not depart from spirits; celestial immortals do not depart from heaven.\n\nLü said: What is meant by a ghost immortal?\n\nZhong said: The ghost immortal is the lowest of the five immortals. One transcends within Yin, yet the spirit-image is unclear, the ghostly barrier has no surname, and the Three Mountains have no name. Though one does not enter the wheel of rebirth, one can scarcely return to Penglai or Yingzhou, and in the end, has no place to return—only to be reborn in a womb and take shelter in a dwelling. This is all.\n\nLü said: This being a ghost immortal, what methods and what practices lead to such a state?\n\nZhong said: Those who cultivate yet do not awaken to the great Dao from the outset, desiring quick success, become like withered wood, their hearts like dead ashes. Their spirit and consciousness are inwardly guarded, their will undivided and undispersed. From concentration, they emit a Yin spirit—this is a clear and numinous ghost, not a purely Yang immortal. Because their will is undivided, their Yin spirit does not scatter, hence they are called ghost immortals. Though called immortals, they are in truth ghosts. The followers of Buddhism who practice to this point claim to have attained the Dao—truly laughable!\n\nLü said: What is meant by a human immortal?\n\nZhong said: The human immortal is the second lowest of the five immortals. Those who cultivate the Dao yet do not awaken to the great Dao obtain one method within the Dao, one technique within that method, and hold to their faith and will without wavering for their entire lives. The qi of the Five Phases err in their convergence and union; the physical form is somewhat firm, and the eight perverse epidemics cannot harm them. They enjoy much peace and little illness—this is called a human immortal.\n\nLü said: What methods and what practices lead to this state of human immortality?\n\nZhong said: Those who cultivate may at first hear of the great Dao, but their karma is heavy and their fortune thin. All manner of demonic obstacles cause them to abandon their original resolve, and they stop at small accomplishments in the methods, unable to change or progress for their entire lives, unable to adapt to the four seasons. For example, those who cut off the five flavors—how would they know of the six qi? Those who forget the seven emotions—how would they know of the ten precepts?",

      "translated_text": "Those who practice rinsing and swallowing mistake it for exhalation and inhalation; those who cling to sexual arts deride purity and contention as folly. Those who delight in seizing qi from things rather than from heaven and earth refuse to abandon grain-eating; those who fix their minds to absorb the essence of sun and moon refuse to practice daoyin. Sitting alone in breath-holding—how would they know of spontaneity? Bending the body and toiling the form—how would they recognize non-action? Absorbing yin by taking a woman’s qi differs from contracting the Golden Turtle; nourishing yang by consuming a woman’s milk differs from refining the elixir. By analogy, such methods are countless, yet all belong to the Dao. Unable to embrace the great Dao in its entirety, they achieve mastery only in one method or one technique within it, attaining peace, longevity, and nothing more—hence they are called human immortals.\n\nThere is another class: those who delight in fleeting pleasures and grow weary of perseverance, who practice carelessly, mistime their efforts, and disorder their days. Instead of gaining longevity, they bring on illness—such cases abound in the world.\n\nLü said: What then is an earth immortal?\n\nZhong said: An earth immortal stands halfway between heaven and earth, possessing the talent of a divine immortal. Failing to awaken to the great Dao, they remain within the methods of minor attainment. Though their achievements are not outwardly visible, they attain long life and dwell in the world without dying among men.\n\nLü said: How does one begin the path to earth immortality?\n\nZhong said: First, one must grasp the principle of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, and the numbers of the sun and moon’s generation and completion. Within the body, one employs years and months; within the day, one employs hours and moments. First, one must recognize Dragon and Tiger; next, one must pair Kan and Li. One must distinguish the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source, and discern the earliness and lateness of qi’s seasons. Gathering the True One, observing the Two Modes, arraying the Three Powers, distinguishing the Four Images, differentiating the Five Movements, stabilizing the Six Qi, assembling the Seven Treasures, ordering the Eight Trigrams, and traversing the Nine Provinces. The Five Phases are inverted, qi is transmitted from mother to child, and fluids circulate between husband and wife. The Three Fields are reversed and refined into the elixir, which permanently anchors the Lower Field. Refining the form to dwell in the world, one attains long life without death, becoming an immortal of the earthly realm—hence called an earth immortal.\n\nLü said: What is a divine immortal?\n\nZhong said: A divine immortal, weary of dwelling in the dusty world, continues their practice without cease, linking the joints as one. Lead is drawn out and mercury added, refining the golden essence to the crown and returning the jade fluid as the elixir. The form is refined into qi, the Five Qi ascend to the origin, and the Three Yang gather at the crown. When merit is complete, the form is forgotten, and the fetal immortal transforms spontaneously. Yin is exhausted and yang is pure; a body appears outside the body. Shedding the mortal frame, one ascends as an immortal, transcends the ordinary, and enters sagehood. Leaving the dusty world behind, one returns to the Three Mountains—hence called a divine immortal.\n\nLü said: What is a heavenly immortal?\n\nZhong said: A heavenly immortal, weary of dwelling in the dusty realm, continues their practice without cease until they attain liberation—thus becoming a divine immortal. A divine immortal, weary of dwelling on the Three Isles, transmits the Dao among men. Above, they have merit; below, they have conduct. When merit and conduct are complete, they receive the celestial writ and return to the Grotto-Heavens—hence called a heavenly immortal. Once a heavenly immortal, if weary of dwelling in the Grotto-Heavens, they may take office as a celestial official: the lower are Water Officials, the middle are Earth Officials, and the upper are Heavenly Officials. Having rendered great service to heaven and earth, and great conduct in past and present, they are promoted through the ranks. After serving in the thirty-six Grotto-Heavens, they return to the eighty-one Yang Heavens; after serving in the eighty-one Yang Heavens, they return to the realm of the Three Pure Ones, the Spontaneous, and the Non-Being.\n\nLü said: Ghost immortals are surely beyond seeking, and heavenly immortals beyond daring to hope for. Might I hear of the methods for human, earthly, and divine immortals?\n\nZhong said: Human immortals do not transcend the methods of minor attainment; earthly immortals do not transcend the methods of middle attainment; divine immortals do not transcend the methods of great attainment. These three levels of attainment are, in truth, one. Using methods to seek the Dao is not difficult; using the Dao to seek immortality, immortality is easily attained.\n\nLü said: From ancient times to the present, those who cultivate life have not failed to seek longevity, nor to seek ascent as immortals. Yet why do they not attain longevity or ascend as immortals?\n\nZhong said: Their methods do not accord with the Dao. Relying on extensive learning and forced memorization, they create minor tests and pursue heterodox paths, inevitably falling into illness and death. Yet they still claim to have achieved liberation in death, misleading the world. They mutually praise one another, preventing the great Dao from being heard. Even those with sincere faith and苦志, who practice diligently for a long time, ultimately see no results and pass away with the seasons. Alas! To discourse on the great Dao...",

      "translated_text": "Lü said: What then is this great Dao?\n\nZhong said: The great Dao is formless and nameless, unquestioned and unanswered. Vast beyond all bounds, minute beyond all measure—none can truly know it, none can truly practice it.\n\nLü said: From ancient times to the present, those who have attained mastery first study the Dao, then possess the Dao, then realize the Dao, and finally perfect the Dao. In this world, they enter Penglai Isle; they ascend to the Grotto Heavens, then to the Heaven of Yang, and finally to the Three Pure Realms—all are those who have perfected the Dao. Yet now, Master, you alone say the Dao cannot be known or practiced. Does this mean the Dao remains hidden from you?\n\nZhong said: I have certainly not concealed the Dao. Rather, those in the world who claim to follow it possess only the name of loving the Dao. Though they may hear of the great Dao, they lack faith; though they may have faith, they lack苦志. They change their course by evening from what they pursued at dawn, forget what they sat to do when they stand, begin with diligence but end in sloth. Thus I say the great Dao is difficult to know and difficult to practice.\n\nLü said: What is the principle behind the Dao being difficult to know and difficult to practice?\n\nZhong said: Because minor heterodox methods yield quick results, the common crowd readily transmits them to one another, persisting until death without awakening. This has become a corrupt custom that undermines the great Dao. Some practice fasting, some abstain from grain, some gather qi, some rinse and swallow saliva, some leave their wives, some forsake flavors, some meditate in dhyāna, some maintain silence, some engage in visualization, some cultivate yin, some ingest qi, some endure cold, some calm the mind, some sever worldly ties, some open the crown of the head, some contract the genitals, some withdraw from the world, some study texts, some refine elixirs, some regulate breath, some practice daoyin, some expel and absorb, some engage in sexual arts, some make offerings, some provide alms, some perform acts of salvation, some enter mountains, some discern their nature, some remain unmoving, some receive and uphold precepts. The minor heterodox methods are too numerous to recount.\n\nFor instance, some seek the essence of the sun and moon, seize the qi of heaven and earth, fix their thoughts and intentions, and hope to congeal cinnabar. They contort their bodies and exhaust their forms, desiring liberation. Restricting outflow while increasing intake may cure illness. Mistaking this for true fetal breathing or thoughtless silence may nurture the nature. Yet they point to it as the true qi of the Great One, the unyielding golden spear, the Yellow River flowing backward—mere inferior methods for nurturing life. Their bodies like withered wood, their minds like dead ashes—these are but minor arts of gathering spirit.\n\nAlas! From ancient times to the present, those who follow the Dao have painstakingly fixed their minds on such practices. They swallow saliva as medicine—how can they attain transformation? They amass qi as an elixir—how can it remain? They designate the liver as the dragon and the lungs as the tiger—how can they unite? They identify Kan as lead and Li as mercury—how can they refine and replenish? They irrigate in all seasons, hoping for the yellow sprout to grow. With single-minded focus, they seek the great medicine, yet they miscount years and months, waste days and hours. Unaware of the root of the Five Phases, how can they comprehend the transformations of the Three Powers?\n\nSeeking branches and plucking leaves, they mislead later generations, causing the great Dao to grow ever more distant and neglected. Heresies arise and become custom, losing the original intent of the ancient masters. This stems from hearsay and superficial learning, passing techniques to the ignorant, who in turn instruct others. Thus they pass through the seasons and descend to the Yellow Springs, a pitiful outcome.\n\nIt is not that I do not wish to expound the great Dao, but the world’s people bear heavy karma and meager fortune. They distrust the celestial mechanism, value wealth over life, and willingly become lowly ghosts.\n\nLü said: The minor heterodox methods are now clear. May I hear of the great Dao?\n\nZhong said: The Dao originally requires no question, and questions originally elicit no answer. Yet when the true origin divides, the great simplicity scatters. The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three. The One is essence, the Two is function, the Three is transformation. Essence and function arise from yin and yang; transformation results from their union. The Three Powers—Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—all derive from the One Dao. The Dao generates the Two Qi, the Two Qi generate the Three Powers, the Three Powers generate the Five Phases, and the Five Phases generate the myriad things. Among the myriad things, the most intelligent and noble is humanity.\n\nOnly humanity can fathom the principles of the myriad things, fully realize its own nature, and thereby master destiny. Preserving life and safeguarding destiny to unite with the Dao, one may attain the same enduring solidity as Heaven and Earth.\n\nLü said: Heaven and Earth endure forever, spanning millennia without end, while human life lasts a hundred years, and even seventy is rare. Why does the Dao reside in Heaven and Earth yet seem distant from humanity?\n\nZhong said: The Dao is not distant from humanity; humanity distances itself from the Dao.

      "translated_text": "And its inception has its time, its fruition its day.\n\nLü said: Heaven embodies the Dao of Qian, employing yang, and yang governs ascent—how then does it unite with Earth? Earth embodies the Dao of Kun, employing yin, and yin governs descent—how then does it unite with Heaven? If Heaven and Earth do not unite, how can yin and yang converge? If yin and yang do not converge, how can Qian and Kun function? Without the function of Qian and Kun, though there be a time of inception and a day of fruition, how can the great Dao be attained?\n\nZhong said: The Dao of Heaven takes Qian as its essence and yang as its function, accumulating qi above. The Dao of Earth takes Kun as its essence and yin as its function, accumulating water below. Heaven practices the Dao by Qian seeking Kun: once sought, it becomes the eldest son, called Zhen; twice sought, the middle son, called Kan; thrice sought, the youngest son, called Gen. Thus does Heaven unite with Earth, and through Earth’s Dao seeking Kun’s Dao, the three yang are born. Then Earth practices the Dao by Kun seeking Qian: once sought, it becomes the eldest daughter, called Xun; twice sought, the middle daughter, called Li; thrice sought, the youngest daughter, called Dui. Thus does Earth unite with Heaven, and through Kun’s Dao seeking Qian’s Dao, the three yin are born. The three yang converge with the three yin, and the myriad things are born; the three yin converge with the three yang, and the myriad things are completed. The union of Heaven and Earth fundamentally arises from Qian and Kun seeking each other, thereby operating within the Dao. Qian and Kun seeking each other generate the six qi; the six qi converging divide into the five phases; the five phases converging give birth to and complete the myriad things. When the Dao of Qian descends, the three seekings conclude, and its yang ascends again, yang concealing yin within, returning above to Heaven. When the Dao of Kun ascends, the three seekings conclude, and its yin descends again, yin concealing yang within, returning below to Earth. Yang concealing yin—its yin does not dissipate, and is called true yin. When true yin reaches Heaven, it is born through yang, so when yin descends from Heaven, how can it be without yang? Yin concealing yang—its yang does not perish, and is called true yang. When true yang reaches Earth, it is activated through yin, so when yang ascends from Earth, how can it be without yin? Yang concealing yin—its yin does not dissipate, returning to Earth; yin concealing yang—its yang does not perish, returning to Heaven. Revolving and beginning anew, operating without cease, their union never departs from the Dao—thus do they endure and remain firm.\n\nLü said: The mechanism of Heaven and Earth, operating within the Dao to attain longevity, is the achievement of their function. Though humans possess intelligence and aspire to embrace the great Dao through tranquility—whether to attain peace and longevity, immortality, or transcendence and ascension—how do they activate and operate the great Dao, moving in accord with the celestial mechanism to likewise endure and remain firm, abiding through the eons?\n\nZhong said: The great Dao is formless, taking form through what it attains. The great Dao is nameless, taking names through what it possesses. Heaven and Earth attain it and call it the Dao of Qian and Kun; the sun and moon attain it and call it the Dao of yin and yang. If humans attain it in the court, it is called the Dao of ruler and minister; in the inner chambers, the Dao of husband and wife; in the village, the Dao of elder and younger; in the school, the Dao of friends; in the household, the Dao of father and son. Thus, what appears externally is never without the Dao. As for the union of father and mother: the father’s yang essence advances first while yin follows, true qi entering true water, the fire of the heart and the water of the kidneys refining into essence. Once the essence is emitted, encountering the mother’s yin, it first advances with water to cleanse the useless places; encountering the mother’s yang, it first advances with blood to receive it before the uterus. Essence and blood form the fetal sac, and true qi enters the mother’s womb. Over days and months, true qi transforms and shapes the person. Like Heaven and Earth practicing the Dao, Qian and Kun seeking each other generate the three yin and three yang: true qi as yang, true water as yin, yang concealing water within, yin concealing qi within. Qi governs ascent, and within qi is true water; water governs descent, and within water is true qi. True water is true yin; true qi is true yang. True yang follows water in descending, as Qian seeks Kun: above is Zhen, in the middle is Kan, below is Gen. Comparing this to humans, with the center as the measure, from above downward: Zhen is the liver, Kan the kidneys, Gen the bladder. True yin follows qi in ascending, as Kun seeks Qian: below is Xun, in the middle is Li, above is Dui. Comparing this to humans, with the center as the measure, from below upward: Xun is the gallbladder, Li the heart, Dui the lungs. Once the form is complete and the allotted time fulfilled, the child departs from the mother. After birth, original yang resides in the kidneys, generating true qi through original yang; true qi ascends to the heart. Through true qi, true fluid is generated, and true fluid returns to the origin. Ascending and descending in ceaseless exchange, if nothing is depleted, one may prolong life. If one knows the timing without error and regulates addition and withdrawal with precision, one may attain immortality. If one engages in cultivation without weariness and persists in practice without cease, yin will be exhausted and yang purified, allowing one to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood. This is the profound principle of the celestial mechanism, a matter not transmitted through the ages. If you hold faith without doubt, regard fame and profit as fleeting as willow twigs, love and attachment as formidable as bandits, avoid illness as one fears death, guard against losing the body to another shell, and contemplate the transmigration of the spirit into other forms—if you possess the resolve for tranquility, then first strengthen your root, lest original yang be lost and true qi dissipated.",

The Great Dao is nameless, yet it propels the sun and moon. The sun and moon are the essence of Greater Yin and Greater Yang, silently recording the degrees of heaven and earth’s conjunctions, aiding in the generation and transformation of the myriad things. Rising in the east and setting in the west, they divide day and night; moving south and north, they determine cold and heat. Unceasing in their alternation of day and night, hastening the succession of cold and heat, the corporeal soul gives birth to the ethereal soul, and the ethereal soul gives birth to the corporeal soul. Advancing and retreating in due time, they do not err from the reckoning of Qian and Kun; coming and going by measure, they do not deviate from the appointed cycles of heaven and earth.\"\n\nLü said: \"How do they rise in the east and set in the west to divide day and night?\"\nZhong said: \"When primal chaos first divided and the Dark and Yellow settled into place, the form of heaven and earth resembled an egg, with the Six Directions enclosed within, round as a sphere. The sun and moon rise and set, moving above the heavens and below the earth, circling east and west in their course like a wheel. When the sun rises in the east and has not yet set in the west, it is day; when it sets in the west and has not yet risen in the east, it is night—thus the sun’s rising and setting divide day and night. The moon’s rising and setting differ from the sun’s: it bears its corporeal soul in the west and receives its ethereal soul in the east, shining its light by night while its ethereal soul lies hidden by day. As days and hours accumulate, it rises and sets, moving from west to east. At first, the ethereal soul is born within the corporeal soul, appearing like a drawn bow, its light shining in the west at early night. Next, the ethereal soul fills half the corporeal soul, corresponding to the first quarter, its light shining in the south at early night. Then, the ethereal soul fills the corporeal soul entirely, facing the sun, its light shining in the east at early night. Next, the corporeal soul is born within the ethereal soul, appearing like a broken mirror, its ethereal soul hidden in the west at early day. Then, the corporeal soul fills half the ethereal soul, corresponding to the last quarter, its ethereal soul hidden in the south at early day. Finally, the corporeal soul fills the ethereal soul entirely, turning its back to the sun, its ethereal soul hidden in the east at early day—thus the moon’s rising and setting divide day and night.\"\n\nLü said: \"How do they move south and north to determine cold and heat?\"\nZhong said: \"After the winter solstice, the sun rises at the beginning of *chen* with fifty *fen* and sets at the end of *shen* with fifty *fen*.

After the summer solstice, the sun rises at the end of *yin* with fifty *fen* and sets at the beginning of *xu* with fifty *fen*. Thereafter, its rising and setting shift from north to south, reaching the winter solstice as the limit. From south to north, from winter to summer, cold turns to heat; from north to south, from summer to winter, heat turns to cold. The summer day is the winter night, and the winter day is the summer night. After the winter solstice, the moon rises from north to south, corresponding to the summer day; after the summer solstice, the moon rises from south to north, corresponding to the winter day—thus the sun and moon’s coming and going determine cold and heat.\"\n\nLü said: \"The mechanism of heaven and earth, the ascent and descent of yin and yang, is no different from man’s practice. Can the sun and moon’s rising and setting, their coming and going, their intertwining cycles and conjunctions, be likened to man?\"\nZhong said: \"The mechanism of heaven and earth lies in the ascent and descent of yin and yang. In their ascent and descent, the Supreme Ultimate is born; in their mutual generation and completion, they cycle endlessly, never straying from the Dao and thus attaining longevity. If the cultivator takes heaven and earth as their model, they too may attain long life without death. If likened to the sun and moon’s measured movements, their coming and going, their conjunctions, it is only that the moon receives the sun’s ethereal soul, transforming yang into yin, exhausting yin and purifying yang, so that the moon’s radiance gleams, dispelling its dark corporeal soul, like the sun’s brilliance illuminating the earth below. At such a time, it is like man’s cultivation: refining qi into spirit, shedding the mortal form to ascend as an immortal, forging a body of pure yang.\"\n\nLü said: \"For those who cultivate the truth and uphold the Dao, in grasping the principles of heaven and earth’s yin-yang ascent and descent, the sun and moon’s essence in their conjunctions—where should they begin their practice, and which of the two should come first?\"\nZhong said: \"First, emulate the celestial mechanism, clarify the principles of yin and yang’s ascent and descent, so that true water and true fire merge as one, refining the great elixir to eternally guard the cinnabar field, enduring through eons without death and attaining a lifespan equal to heaven and earth. If weary of the dusty world and persisting in practice, then seize the conjunction of sun and moon, refining yang with yang so that yin does not arise, nurturing spirit with qi so that spirit does not scatter.

These are the times within the month, the third kind.\n\nTaking sixty *fen* as one *ke*, eight *ke* and twenty *fen* as one hour, and one and a half hours as one *gua*, the *gua* fixes the eight directions, while the cardinal divisions number four. From *zi* to *mao*, yin holds half of yang, as lesser yang arises within greater yin. From *mao* to *wu*, yang contains yang, as pure lesser yang gives rise to greater yang. From *wu* to *you*, yang holds half of yin, as lesser yin arises within greater yang. From *you* to *zi*, yin contains yin, as pure lesser yin gives rise to greater yin. These are the times within the day, the fourth kind.\n\nThat which is swift to lose and hard to gain is the time within the body. That which departs quickly and returns slowly is the months within the year. That which flashes like lightning or sparks like flint is the hours within the day. Days accumulate into months, months into years; as years and months slip by, the light of time speeds onward. Yet men still covet fame and chase profit, their deluded hearts unchecked; they dote on children and cherish grandchildren, their attachments ever renewed. Even if they turn their hearts to the Dao, how can they escape old age and failing qi? Like spring snow or autumn blossoms, they endure but a fleeting moment; like the setting sun or the morning moon, they cast no light that lasts. For those who follow the Dao, the rarest treasure is the time within the body.\n\nBright sun and enchanting scenes, a hundred flowers in bloom, waterside pavilions and lofty towers, refreshing winds and carefree delight, moonlit conversations and snowy-day feasts—indulging in endless pleasures, they fritter away their finite time. Even if they turn their hearts to the Dao, it is only when illness clings to the body. Like a broken boat yet to cross the river, who would not seek rescue? Like a leaking roof repaired again, who could bear to abandon further mending? For those who follow the Dao, they squander the time of youth within their prime.\n\nThe neighbor’s rooster has not yet crowed, yet they chide themselves for rising late; the street drums are barely heard, yet they regret returning home too soon. Greed and delusion never pause for rest, and vain desires know no satisfaction. Gold and jade fill the hall, but when illness comes, what can withstand it? A house full of children and grandchildren—yet when the breath ceases, who can take their place? Day and night turn without cease, yet the world remains unaware. For those who follow the Dao, the most lamentable is the time within the day.\n\nLü said: \"The time within the body, the time within the year, the time within the month, and the time within the day—all are time. Yet why, Master, do you deem the time within the body the hardest to obtain and the time within the day the most regrettable?\"\n\nZhong said: \"For those who follow the Dao, youth is hard to come by. In youth, cultivation strengthens the root and foundation; all things are easily accomplished, and great attainment may be reached in a thousand days. For those who follow the Dao, middle age is also hard to come by. In middle age, cultivation first repairs and completes, then proceeds to progress. At first, one returns from old age to youth; later, one enters sagehood and transcends the mundane.\n\nYet those who follow the Dao may not awaken in youth, nor realize in middle age. Some turn their minds to clarity and stillness only after disaster strikes; others set their hearts on the subtle and formless only when illness befalls. In late-life cultivation, one must first speak of salvation and protection, then of supplementation and benefit. Only then, beginning with the lesser accomplishment, can one accumulate merit to reach the middle accomplishment. The middle accomplishment allows one to accumulate merit only to the point of returning from old age to youth and refining the form to abide in the world. Yet the five qi cannot ascend to the origin, the three yangs cannot gather at the crown, and casting off the mortal frame to ascend as an immortal remains unattainable. Thus, the time within the body is the hardest to obtain.\"\n\nLü said: \"I now understand that the time within the body is indeed hard to obtain. But why is the time within the day most regrettable?\"\n\nZhong said: \"A single day for a person is like a month for the sun and moon, like a year for heaven and earth. The Great Dao gives birth to heaven and earth; heaven and earth divide above and below, separated by eighty-four thousand *li*. After the winter solstice, yang ascends from within the earth. For each *qi*, lasting fifteen days, it rises seven thousand *li*. Over one hundred eighty days, yang ascends to heaven, and the Supreme Ultimate generates yin. After the summer solstice, yin descends from within heaven. For each *qi*, lasting fifteen days, it descends seven thousand *li*. Over one hundred eighty days, yin descends to earth, and the Supreme Ultimate regenerates yang. Thus it cycles endlessly, ceaselessly revolving without straying from the Dao—hence its longevity.\n\nThe sun and moon, set in motion, take form, each encircling eight hundred forty *li*. After the new moon, six arises within nine. For each day, comprising twelve hours, the *hun* advances seventy *li* within the *po*. Over fifteen days, comprising one hundred eighty hours, the *hun* advances eight hundred forty *li* within the *po*. After the full moon, nine arises within six. For each day, comprising twelve hours, the *po* advances seventy *li* within the *hun*.

In the South resides the Vermilion Emperor, who executes the summer mandate—within yang, yang ascends, causing the myriad things to grow. In the West resides the White Emperor, who executes the autumn mandate—within yang, yin arises, causing the myriad things to mature. In the North resides the Black Emperor, who executes the winter mandate—within yin, yin advances, causing the myriad things to die. Each of the four seasons spans ninety days, with eighteen days at the end of each season governed by the Yellow Emperor. Thus, in spring, he assists the Azure Emperor in bringing forth life; in summer, he follows the Vermilion Emperor in nurturing growth; in autumn, he aids the White Emperor in fruition; and in winter, he restrains the Black Emperor to enforce severity. The Five Emperors each govern seventy-two days, totaling three hundred and sixty days to form a year, assisting Heaven and Earth in enacting the Dao.\n\nThe Azure Emperor begets offspring named *jia* and *yi*, which are Wood of the East. The Vermilion Emperor begets offspring named *bing* and *ding*, which are Fire of the South. The Yellow Emperor begets offspring named *wu* and *ji*, which are Earth of the Center. The White Emperor begets offspring named *geng* and *xin*, which are Metal of the West. The Black Emperor begets offspring named *ren* and *gui*, which are Water of the North. Manifest in time as symbols, Wood becomes the Azure Dragon, Fire the Vermilion Bird, Earth the Curved Array, Metal the White Tiger, and Water the Dark Warrior. Manifest in time to generate things: when *yi* and *geng* unite in spring, elm appears green while white, preserving the colors of Metal and Wood; when *xin* and *bing* unite in autumn, jujube appears white while red, preserving the colors of Metal and Fire; when *ji* and *geng* unite at summer’s end and autumn’s beginning, melon appears green while yellow, preserving the colors of Earth and Wood; when *ding* and *ren* unite in summer, paulownia appears red while black, preserving the colors of Water and Fire; when *gui* and *wu* unite in winter, tangerine appears black while yellow, preserving the colors of Water and Earth. By analogy, when the Five Emperors interact and manifest in time, life arises in countless things.\n\nLü says: The Five Phases operate in time as such—how then do they operate within humans?\nZhong says: Only humans possess a head round and feet square, embodying the image of Heaven and Earth. With yin descending and yang ascending, they further contain the mechanism of Heaven and Earth. The kidneys are Water, the heart is Fire, the liver is Wood, the lungs are Metal, and the spleen is Earth. Regarding the mutual generation of the Five Phases: Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal, Metal generates Water—what generates is the mother, what is generated is the child. Regarding their mutual overcoming: Water overcomes Fire, Fire overcomes Metal, Metal overcomes Wood, Wood overcomes Earth, Earth overcomes Water—what overcomes is the husband, what is overcome is the wife.\n\nIn terms of mother and child: kidney *qi* generates liver *qi*, liver *qi* generates heart *qi*, heart *qi* generates spleen *qi*, spleen *qi* generates lung *qi*, lung *qi* generates kidney *qi*. In terms of husband and wife: kidney *qi* overcomes heart *qi*, heart *qi* overcomes lung *qi*, lung *qi* overcomes liver *qi*, liver *qi* overcomes spleen *qi*, spleen *qi* overcomes kidney *qi*.

The spleen is the husband of the kidneys, the mother of the lungs, the wife of the liver, and the child of the heart.\n\nThe heart’s internal manifestation is the pulse, its external manifestation is complexion. Its gate and door reside in the tongue, subject to the kidneys’ restraint while driven to serve the lungs—such is the principle of husband and wife. When it receives the liver, it flourishes; when it encounters the spleen, it wanes—such is the principle of mother and child. The kidneys’ internal manifestation is bone, their external manifestation is hair. Their gates and doors are the two ears, subject to the spleen’s restraint while driven to serve the heart—such is the principle of husband and wife. When they receive the lungs, they flourish; when they encounter the liver, they wane—such is the principle of mother and child. The liver’s internal manifestation is sinew, its external manifestation is nails.

Their gates and doors are the nose, subject to the heart’s restraint while driven to serve the liver—such is the principle of husband and wife. When they receive the spleen, they flourish; when they encounter the kidneys, they wane—such is the principle of mother and child. The spleen’s internal manifestation is the viscera, nourishing the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs equally; its external manifestation is flesh. Its gates and doors are the lips and mouth, regulating the ebb and flow of breath, subject to the liver’s restraint while driven to serve the kidneys—such is the principle of husband and wife.

The kidneys are Water—how can Water ascend? The spleen is Earth, and Earth at the center supports Fire to flourish—does it not then overcome Water below? The lungs are Metal, and Metal above, when adjacent to Fire below, is damaged—how can it generate Water?

      "translated_text": "Zhong says: The Five Phases return to their origin, a single *qi* drawing them forth. Primordial yang ascends and generates true Water; true Water transforms and generates true *qi*; true *qi* transforms and generates the yang spirit. At the outset, the Five Phases are fixed in position, each with one husband and one wife.\n\nThe kidneys are Water, and within Water lies Metal—Metal being the mother of Water. At the beginning, one must recognize the Metal within Water. Water naturally resents Earth, so after gathering the medicine, Earth must be returned to Water.\n\nThe dragon is the image of the liver; the tiger is the spirit of the lungs. The yang dragon emerges from the Li Palace; the yin tiger arises from the Kan position.\n\nWhen the Five Phases move in reverse, *qi* is transmitted from child to mother—from *zi* to *wu*, this is the time when yang is born of yang. When the Five Phases are inverted, fluids flow between husband and wife—from *wu* to *zi*, this is refining yang within yin.\n\nYang cannot be completed without yin, yet in the end, there is no yin that does not perish. Yin cannot be generated without yang, yet in the end, when yin is cut off, longevity is achieved.\n\nLü says: The Five Phases originate from the single *qi* of yin and yang—what is meant by \"single *qi*\"?\n\nZhong says: The single *qi* refers to when father and mother unite, their essence and blood transforming to form the body. The kidneys generate the spleen; the spleen generates the liver; the liver generates the lungs; the lungs generate the heart; the heart generates the small intestine; the small intestine generates the large intestine; the large intestine generates the gallbladder; the gallbladder generates the stomach; the stomach generates the bladder. Thus, yin forms the body through essence and blood, while yang resides solely at the origin of life’s beginning—a single point of primordial yang within the two kidneys.\n\nNow, the kidneys are Water, and within Water lies Fire. When Fire ascends, it becomes *qi*, and this *qi* rises to pay homage to the heart. The heart is yang, and when yang unites with yang, the Supreme Ultimate generates yin. Thus, accumulated *qi* generates fluid, and this fluid descends from the heart, returning to the kidneys.\n\nThe liver is the mother of the heart and the child of the kidneys, transmitting the *qi* of the kidneys to the heart. The lungs are the wife of the heart and the mother of the kidneys, conveying the fluids of the heart to the kidneys.\n\nThe ascent and descent of *qi* and fluids resemble the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth; the transmission between liver and lungs is like the cyclical movement of the sun and moon. The Five Phases are but names and numbers. In their union and generation, primordial yang and a single *qi* are the foundation. Within *qi*, true Water is born; within fluids, true *qi* arises. The kidneys are the root of *qi*; the heart is the source of fluids. When the numinous root is firm, all is indistinct and subtle. Within *qi*, true Water naturally arises; when the heart’s source is pure, all is profound and obscure. Within fluids, true Fire naturally exists. Within Fire, one recognizes the true dragon; within Water, one discerns the true tiger.\n\nWhen dragon and tiger unite, they transform into the yellow sprout. When the yellow sprout is conjoined, it coalesces into the great medicine—this is called the Golden Elixir. Once the Golden Elixir is achieved, one is called an immortal.\n\nLü says: When the Golden Elixir is complete and the body is shed to ascend as an immortal, returning to the Ten Isles—this is well understood. But what is meant by the \"yellow sprout\"?\n\nZhong says: It is the true dragon and the true tiger.\n\nLü says: What are the dragon and tiger?\n\nZhong says: The dragon is not the liver but the yang dragon. The yang dragon emerges from within the true Water of the Li Palace. The tiger is not the lungs but the yin tiger. The yin tiger arises from within the true Fire of the Kan position.\n\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating the Dao: Zhong-Lü Transmission of the Dao, Scroll Fourteen (conclusion)*\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating the Dao: Zhong-Lü Transmission of the Dao, Scroll Fifteen*",

      "translated_text": "Zhenyang Perfected Zhongli Quan (Yunfang) instructed Pure Yang Perfected Lü Dongbin (Yanpin) of Mount Dong, who transmitted it to Huayang Perfected Shi Jianwu (Xisheng). On Water and Fire.\n\nLü says: Those who attain long life refine the Golden Elixir. To refine the Golden Elixir, one must first gather the yellow sprout. To obtain the yellow sprout, one must secure the dragon and tiger. The true dragon emerges from the Li Palace, the true tiger arises from the Kan position. Within Li and Kan reside water and fire—what are water and fire?\n\nZhong says: In the body, when speaking of water, there are the Four Seas, Five Lakes, Nine Rivers, Three Isles, Flowery Pond, Jasper Pond, Phoenix Pond, Heavenly Pond, Jade Pond, Kun Pond, Primordial Abyss, and Root Garden. There are divine water, golden waves, jade liquid, jasper springs, yang suet, and white snow—such names cannot be fully enumerated. When speaking of fire in the body, there are only the sovereign fire, ministerial fire, and civilian fire. These three fires take primordial yang as their root and generate true qi. When true qi gathers, one is at peace; when true qi weakens, illness arises. If true qi is dissipated and primordial yang lost, primordial yang exhausted, pure yin prevails, and the primordial spirit departs the body—this is called death.\n\nLü says: Within the human body, a single point of primordial yang ignites the three fires. These three fires arise amid the multitude of waters and yin forces, easily dissipated yet difficult to blaze brightly. If yang is weak and yin abundant, fire scant and water plentiful, one swiftly declines and cannot attain long life. What is to be done?\n\nZhong says: The heart is the sea of blood, the kidneys the sea of qi, the brain the sea of marrow, and the spleen and stomach the sea of water and grain—thus are these Four Seas. The five viscera each have their fluids, governing the positions of east, west, south, north, and center—thus are these Five Lakes. The small intestine, two zhang and four chi in length, winds through nine curves—these are the Nine Rivers. Below the small intestine lies the Primordial Abyss—thus is this described. The head is the upper isle, the heart the middle isle, and the kidneys the lower isle—within these Three Isles, the root and source are spoken of as the Garden of Fragrance. The Flowery Pond lies below the Yellow Court, the Jasper Pond emerges before the Cinnabar Gate, the Kun Pond connects above to the Jade Capital, and the Heavenly Pond directly pierces the Inner Court. The Phoenix Pond lies between the heart and lungs, the Jade Pond within the lips and teeth. Divine water is born within qi, golden waves descend from heaven. Where the red dragon dwells, jasper liquid naturally flows; the jade spring of the mortal embryo only reveals white snow and yang suet after transformation. Watering must be timely to nourish blazing vigor: first the jade liquid, then the golden liquid—both can be used to revert the elixir. Withdrawal and replenishment must be measured to correspond with bathing: first the middle field, then the lower field—both can be used to refine the form. Jade medicine and golden blossoms transform the body into yellow and white; ghee and sweet dew refine it into wondrous fragrance. Such are the efficacies of water.\n\nAs for fire: the civilian fire ascends to assist kidney qi in generating true water; kidney fire ascends to merge with heart liquid, producing true qi. In small measure, it subdues demons and dispels illness; in great measure, it refines the body and burns the elixir. When applied to the Zhou Tian cycle, fire arises to incinerate the body; when the Yang Pass is restrained, it reverts to the origin and refines the medicine. Distinguishing the terrain of the Nine Continents nurtures the yang spirit; burning the burdens of the Three Corpses expels yin ghosts. Ascending, it strikes through the Three Passes in one thrust; descending, it dissolves the Seven Po. Refining form into qi, one becomes light and soars like flight; refining qi into spirit, one sheds the embryo like a molting cicada. Such are the efficacies of fire.\n\nLü says: At first, I heard your instruction and feared that scant fire and abundant water would lead to swift decline. Now, having listened to your lofty discourse, I see that water and fire possess such wondrous efficacy. Ultimately, how does one transform things so that the few can overcome the many, and the weak can become strong?\n\nZhong says: When the two eights of yin dissolve, the nine threes of yang grow. The radiant Golden Elixir can be accomplished in days; with seven returns and nine reversions, the fetal immortal naturally transforms. True qi resides in the heart, and the heart is the source of liquid. Primordial yang resides in the kidneys, and the kidneys are the sea of qi. The bladder is the civilian fire, yet without the civilian fire, it cannot function. The bladder is also the palace of fluids. If one fails to comprehend the celestial mechanism and fathom the mysterious principle, even those who uphold the Dao will struggle to achieve transformation and may succumb to illness and death.\n\nLü says: What is meant by transformation that causes yang to grow and yin to dissolve, allowing the Golden Elixir to form and the fetal immortal to naturally transform?\n\nZhong says: The heart and kidneys are separated by eight cun and four fen—this mirrors the fixed positions of heaven and earth. The generation of qi and liquid from the Supreme Ultimate mirrors the union of yin and yang. The twelve hours of a day mirror the twelve months of a year. The heart generates liquid, yet it does not do so on its own: it is because lung liquid descends to the heart, and the liquid of the heart flows. The liquid flows as husband and wife, descending from above to return to the lower field—this is called \"the wife returning to the husband’s palace.\" The kidneys generate qi, yet they do not do so on their own: it is because bladder qi ascends, and kidney qi flows. The qi flows as mother and child, ascending from below to pay homage to the middle origin—this is called \"the husband returning to the wife’s chamber.\" Liver qi guides kidney qi upward to reach the heart. The heart is fire. When the two qi merge, they steam the lungs; lung liquid descends from the heart—this is called \"the heart generating liquid.\" Since the liquid born of the heart is not dissipated, it is called true water. Lung liquid conveys heart liquid downward to the kidneys. The kidneys are water. When the two waters merge, they moisten the bladder; bladder qi ascends from the kidneys—this is called \"the kidneys generating qi.\" Since the qi born of the kidneys is not consumed, it is called true fire. True fire emerges from within water—vague and indistinct, within it lies something. Gazing, one cannot see it; seeking, one cannot grasp it.",

      "translated_text": "True water emerges from within fire—dim and obscure, within it lies essence. Gazing, one cannot retain it; retaining, one cannot hold it.\n\nLü says: The kidneys are water. Qi born of water is called true fire. But what substance lies within fire? The heart is fire. Liquid born of fire is called true water. What essence lies within water? The substance within fire and the essence within water—being formless and ungraspable, even if sought, it is hard to obtain; even if obtained, what use is it?\n\nZhong says: The ancient sages of highest attainment never departed from this. When the two substances unite in intercourse, they transform into the yellow sprout. When the count is complete and the embryo perfected, the great medicine is formed—this is the true dragon and true tiger.\n\n**On the Dragon and Tiger**\nLü says: The dragon is the image of the liver; the tiger is the spirit of the lungs. Now, within this heart-fire, liquid is born—this liquid is true water. Within this water, dim and obscure, the true dragon lies hidden. Why does the dragon, though not in the liver, emerge from the Li Palace? Within this kidney-water, qi is born—this qi is true fire. Within this fire, vague and indistinct, the true tiger lies concealed. Why does the tiger, though not in the lungs, arise from the Kan position?\n\nZhong says: The dragon is a yang entity. Ascending and soaring in the heavens, when it roars, clouds arise; when it receives moisture, it nourishes the myriad things. In imagery, it is the Azure Dragon; in direction, it is Jia and Yi; in substance, it is wood; in season, it is spring; in the Dao, it is benevolence; in the hexagrams, it is Zhen; within the five viscera of the human body, it is the liver.\n\nThe tiger is a yin entity. Running upon the earth, when it howls, wind arises; when it reaches the mountains, its might subdues the hundred creatures. In imagery, it is the White Tiger; in direction, it is Geng and Xin; in substance, it is metal; in season, it is autumn; in the Dao, it is righteousness; in the hexagrams, it is Dui; within the five viscera of the human body, it is the lungs.\n\nNow, the liver is yang yet resides in a yin position. Thus, kidney qi transmits to liver qi, moving as mother and child—water generates wood. When kidney qi is sufficient, liver qi is born. Once liver qi is born, it severs the kidney’s residual yin, and pure yang qi ascends.\n\nThe lungs are yin yet reside in a yang position. Thus, heart liquid transmits to lung liquid, moving as husband and wife—fire restrains metal. When heart liquid arrives, lung liquid is born. Once lung liquid is born, it severs the heart’s residual yang, and pure yin liquid descends.\n\nSince the liver pertains to yang and severs the kidney’s residual yin, we know that when qi passes through the liver, it becomes pure yang. Within pure yang qi, true unity’s water is concealed—vague and formless, it is called the yang dragon.\n\nSince the lungs pertain to yin and sever the heart’s residual yang, we know that when liquid reaches the lungs, it becomes pure yin. Within pure yin liquid, the correct yang’s radiance is borne—dim and unseen, it is called the yin tiger.\n\nQi ascends and liquid descends; inherently, they cannot unite. Yet within qi lies true unity’s water, which, upon seeing liquid, harmonizes with it. Within liquid lies correct yang’s qi, which, upon seeing qi, naturally gathers.\n\nIf, during transmission, one applies the method to govern it—preventing kidney qi from scattering, gathering true unity’s water from within qi; preventing heart liquid from dissipating, extracting correct yang’s radiance from within liquid—then mother and child meet, mutually cherishing each other. Daily, it grows to the size of a millet grain. After a hundred days, the medicine’s power is complete without flaw. After two hundred days, the sacred embryo hardens. After three hundred days, the fetal immortal is perfected—its form like a pellet, its color like a red tangerine. This is called the elixir medicine. Forever anchoring the lower field, preserving form and abiding in the world, one endures through eons, becoming an immortal upon the earth.\n\nLü says: Kidney water generates qi, and within qi lies true unity’s water—this is called the yin tiger. The tiger, upon seeing liquid, harmonizes with it. Heart fire generates liquid, and within liquid lies correct yang’s qi—this is called the yang dragon. The dragon, upon seeing qi, harmonizes with it. Things gather by kind, and principles divide by nature—this is only natural.\n\nWhen qi is born, liquid also descends. Does true unity’s water within qi not follow liquid downward, transmitting through the five viscera? When liquid is born, qi also ascends. Does correct yang’s qi within liquid not follow qi upward, emerging from the layered tower?\n\nTrue water follows liquid downward—the tiger cannot unite with the dragon. True yang follows qi upward—the dragon cannot unite with the tiger. If dragon and tiger do not unite, how can the yellow sprout arise? Without the yellow sprout, how can the great medicine be formed?\n\nZhong says: When kidney qi is born, it is like the sun emerging from the sea—mist and dew cannot obscure its light. Liquid descends like a sparse curtain—how can it withstand the qi? When qi is robust, true unity’s water naturally flourishes.\n\nWhen heart liquid is born, it is like the severe sky killing things—breath cannot resist its cold. Qi ascends like a jade screen—how can it withstand the liquid? When liquid is abundant, correct yang’s qi may be strong or weak—its certainty is not assured.\n\nLü says: Qi and liquid each arise in their own time. When it is the time for qi to be born, if qi is abundant, true unity’s water is also abundant. When it is the time for liquid to be born, if liquid is abundant, correct yang’s qi is also abundant. Yet why is their flourishing and decline not guaranteed?\n\nZhong says: Kidney qi is easily dissipated—what is hard to obtain is the true tiger. Heart liquid is hard to accumulate—what is easily lost is the true dragon. The ten thousand volumes of elixir classics discuss nothing beyond yin and yang. Within yin and yang, the essence is nothing but dragon and tiger. Among those who uphold the Dao, perhaps one or two in ten thousand understand. Some, though widely read and learned, may know the principles of dragon and tiger but fail to recognize the moment of their union, unaware of the method of gathering. Thus, from ancient times to the present, accomplished scholars—though they cultivate with white-haired devotion, achieving only minor attainment—prolong life across generations but never hear of transcending. This is because they cannot unite dragon and tiger, gather the yellow sprout, and refine the elixir medicine.",

      "translated_text": "On the Elixir Medicine\n\nLü said: \"The principles of dragon and tiger are now understood—may I hear of the great medicine of the Golden Elixir?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"What is called 'medicine' can cure illness. There are three grades of illness: lying in drafts or dampness, braving heat or cold, overwork or indolence, hunger or surfeit at untimely hours—if one does not rest when unwell, illness comes daily. Such is seasonal sickness. Then there are those who refuse to cultivate and discipline themselves, indulging their passions and desires, scattering their primordial yang and depleting their true qi—when they grow old and withered, it is called aging. Such is the sickness of years. And when qi is exhausted and the body hollow, the hun-soul disperses and the shen-soul scatters, a long sigh escapes, the four great elements lose their master, and the body lies abandoned in the wild—this is called death. Such is the sickness of the body.\n\nFor seasonal sickness, as the four seasons cycle through cold, heat, warmth, and frost, if yang is excessive and yin insufficient, one should treat it with cold; if yin is excessive and yang insufficient, one should treat it with warmth. The aged tend toward cold, the young toward heat; the stout have abundant phlegm, the emaciated suffer from accumulations. Men’s illnesses arise from qi, women’s afflictions stem from blood. One supplements the deficient and reduces the excessive, preserves the weak and diminishes the surplus. For minor cases, acupuncture and moxibustion suffice; for severe ones, medicinal decoctions are used. Though occasional discomfort may lead to seasonal illness, a skilled physician can prescribe remedies tailored to the ailment, and all may be cured.\n\nYet how is the sickness of aging to be healed? How is the sickness of death to be treated? Those ancient physicians who could wash the intestines and replenish the flesh—restoring youthful complexion to wrinkled faces and white hair—none have mastered their art. Those who could replace the crown of the head and rejoin severed limbs—preserving form and dwelling in the world to attain long life—none have grasped their method.\"\n\nLü said: \"Occasional discomfort, when it becomes seasonal illness, can indeed be cured by skilled physicians and famous medicines. But what of the sickness of decrepit old age, the suffering of qi’s exhaustion and life’s end? How are these to be treated—is there no medicine for them?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"There are three grades of illness: seasonal sickness is cured by herbal medicines. For the sickness of the body and the sickness of years, there are two kinds of medicine: the Internal Elixir and the External Elixir.\"\n\nLü asked: \"What is the External Elixir?\"\n\nZhong said: \"In ancient times, the Most High Primordial Lord transmitted the Dao to humanity, explaining the principles of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, the proper cycles of the sun and moon. Thereafter, elixir classics filled the world, and people came to know the great Dao. The Venerable Guangcheng taught the Yellow Emperor, who, in the intervals of governance, practiced according to the method but saw no results for a long time. Guangcheng then revealed that between heart and kidney there exists true qi and true water, and between qi and water there exists true yin and true yang. Their union forms the great medicine, comparable to the supreme treasure hidden within metals and stones. Thus, on Mount Kongtong, he refined the great elixir using internal methods.\n\nAmong the eight stones, only cinnabar is used, and mercury is extracted from it. Among the five metals, only black lead is used, and silver is drawn from it. Mercury corresponds to the yang dragon, silver to the yin tiger. The heart’s fire is like cinnabar’s redness, the kidney’s water like lead’s blackness. The yearly fire follows the seasons without losing the strategy of heaven and earth; the monthly fire adjusts additions and subtractions according to the proper balance of civil and martial. A three-tiered furnace is erected, each tier nine inches high, square on the outside and round within, gathering the qi of the eight directions and aligning with the seasons of the four times. The golden crucible, containing lead and mercury, is no different from the liquid of the lungs. Sulfur serves as the medicine, harmonizing with the numinous cinnabar, comparable to the Yellow Dame.\n\nAfter three years of minor completion, consuming it can eradicate all illness. After six years of medium completion, it naturally extends life. After nine years of great completion, one ascends and moves freely. A stalwart warrior, stretching his arms, can traverse a thousand or ten thousand miles. Though he may not return to Penglai, he will not die even in the great kalpas of the human world.\"\n\nLü said: \"Since ancient times, many have refined elixirs, yet few have seen success. Why is this?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"There are three reasons why elixir refinement fails: First, one cannot distinguish true from false medicinal materials, nor understand the fire phases of additions and subtractions. The supreme treasure is thus reduced to smoke and ash in an instant, wasting time and effort, with nothing achieved. Second, though the medicinal materials may be fine, if one does not know the fire phases—or knows the fire phases but lacks the materials—the two do not harmonize, and nothing is achieved. Third, though the materials may be excellent and the fire phases appropriate, with no error in years, months, or days, and though the elixir is completed with sufficient qi, if one’s external conduct is not prepared, it transforms into a black crane and soars into the void, leaving no means to consume it. These are the three reasons for failure.\n\nMoreover, medicinal materials are the essence and fruit of heaven and earth’s finest qi, while fire phases are the protection of immortals who cultivate the Dao. In the time of the Three Sovereigns, the Yellow Emperor refined the nine-times-cycled elixir before it was complete. After the Five Emperors, the Primordial One refined the elixir for three years before it was done. By the Warring States period, baleful qi congealed in the sky, corpses littered the fields, and things could no longer receive heaven and earth’s finest qi—thus the world lacked medicinal materials. Those who possessed the method fled calamity and died in mountain valleys. Elixir formulas and immortal arts, though recorded on bamboo and silk, rotted away over time, and the world no longer had them. If the mundane world had medicinal materials, the First Emperor of Qin would not have sought them on the islands of the sea. If the mundane world had elixir formulas, Wei Boyang would not have studied the *Book of Changes*. Yet some, with vast learning and strong memory, mislead later generations, ruining ten thousand households without a single success—seeking externally is also a mistake.\"\n\nLü said: \"The principles of the External Elixir originate from Guangchengzi, who used internal methods as his model. Even if one achieves completion, it takes nine years, and medicinal materials are hard to find, formulas difficult to obtain. In the end, one may ascend and soar, but never sees transcendence into sagehood or return to the Ten Isles.\"",

Some, though widely read and learned, may know the principles of dragon and tiger but fail to recognize the moment of their union, unaware of the method of gathering. Thus, from ancient times to the present, accomplished scholars—though they cultivate with white-haired devotion, achieving only minor attainment—prolong life across generations but never hear of transcending. This is because they cannot unite dragon and tiger, gather the yellow sprout, and refine the elixir medicine.",

      "translated_text": "\"May I dare ask about the Internal Elixir—could I hear of it?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"The External Elixir is not without use, but those who follow the Dao often awaken to this only in their later years, when their root and source are no longer deeply firm. The kidneys are the root of qi; if the root is not deep, the leaves cannot flourish. The heart is the source of fluids; if the source is not clear, the flow cannot be long. Thus, one borrows the Five Metals and Eight Stones, accumulating days and months to refine the Three Grades, each with three ranks, forming the Nine-Rank Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir. This aids in connecting one’s true qi, refining the form to abide in the world, and ascending lightly as if in flight.\n\nYet if one cultivates the Internal Work, recognizing the moment of union and knowing the method of gathering, the Embryonic Immortal is achieved, and transcendence is attained in a matter of days. Those who fail to comprehend this cling to the External Elixir, adding fire and increasing days to ingest it, hoping to ascend to the celestial realms—truly laughable. Since they do not investigate the source of the External Elixir, let me expound in detail the principles of the Internal Elixir.\n\nThe medicinal materials of the Internal Elixir arise from the heart and kidneys—something all people possess. The medicinal materials of the Internal Elixir originally reside in Heaven and Earth, which we see every day. The fire timing follows the cycles of the sun and moon’s waxing and waning; the refinement emulates the harmony of husband and wife’s union. The Sacred Embryo forms, and true qi is born. Within qi, there is qi—like a dragon nurturing its pearl. The Great Elixir is completed, and the Yang Spirit emerges. Beyond the body, there is another body—like a cicada shedding its husk.\n\nWithin this Internal Elixir, the Dragon and Tiger unite to transform into the Yellow Sprout, and from the Yellow Sprout, Lead and Mercury are distinguished.\n\n**On Lead and Mercury**\nLü said: \"The Internal Elixir does not transcend the Dragon and Tiger. The Tiger emerges from the Kan Palace—this is the water within qi. The Dragon emerges from the Li Palace—this is the qi within water. The External Elixir takes Mercury from cinnabar, likening it to the Yang Dragon, and uses the silver within lead, likening it to the Yin Tiger. Yet Lead and Mercury are External Elixir substances—how then do the Dragon and Tiger unite to transform into the Yellow Sprout, and from the Yellow Sprout, Lead and Mercury are distinguished? What, then, are the Lead and Mercury within the Internal Elixir?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"That which embraces the quality of Heavenly Oneness and stands as the chief of the Five Metals is black lead. Lead gives birth to silver, and thus lead is the mother of silver. That which responds to the qi of the Great Yang and stands as the chief of all stones is cinnabar. Cinnabar gives birth to Mercury, and thus Mercury is the child of cinnabar. What is difficult to extract is the silver within lead; what is easy to lose is the Mercury within cinnabar. When silver and Mercury are combined and refined, they naturally become a supreme treasure—this is the principle of Lead and Mercury as seen in the External Elixir.\n\nIf we speak of the Internal Work as it appears in humans, ancient and modern discussions differ, so let us take the most profound and wondrous explanation. At the moment of parents’ union, essence and blood combine, enclosing true qi, which is entrusted to the mother’s purely Yin palace, where the spirit is concealed within the unseparated Yin and Yang. After three hundred days, the embryo is complete; after five thousand days, the qi is full.\n\nIn terms of the Five Phases, the human body is fundamentally essence and blood—water comes first. In terms of the Five Viscera, essence and blood form the physical image, and the kidneys are born first. Within the Kidney Water, hidden from the moment of conception, lies the parents’ true qi. This true qi is concealed within the inner kidneys of a person—this is what is called Lead. The upright qi within the kidneys, the true Oneness Water within qi, is named the True Tiger—this is what is meant by the silver within lead.\n\nKidney qi transmits to Liver qi, and Liver qi transmits to Heart qi. The Heart qi reaches the Great Ultimate and generates fluid, within which resides the upright Yang qi—this is what is called cinnabar, the fluid of the heart. What is called Mercury is the upright Yang qi within the heart’s fluid. When the true Oneness Water within qi cherishes and harmonizes with the upright Yang qi within the fluid, qi and fluid accumulate to form the embryonic sac, which is conveyed into the Yellow Court. With flawless firing, the Embryonic Immortal naturally transforms—this is comparable to the union of lead and silver with Mercury, refined into a treasure.\n\nLü said: \"Among the Five Metals, one extracts silver from lead. Within the Eight Stones, Mercury is drawn from cinnabar. Placed in the crucible and matched with medicinal ingredients, Mercury naturally becomes cinnabar, and silver naturally becomes a treasure. Yet how does one extract silver from the Lead within a person? How does one draw Mercury from the cinnabar within a person? How does Mercury become cinnabar, and how does silver become a treasure?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"Lead fundamentally arises from the union of the parents’ true qi, pure and undivided. After the form is complete, it is stored within the kidneys. The two kidneys face each other, and together their qi ascends—this is called the Primordial Yang qi. Within this qi is water—this is called the true Oneness Water. Water rises with qi; when qi abides, water abides; when qi scatters, water scatters. This water and qi are like mother and child, never parting. The discerning eye sees only the qi, not the water. When this true Oneness Water unites with the heart’s upright Yang qi, this is called the Dragon and Tiger mating to transform into the Yellow Sprout, which becomes the Great Elixir.\n\nThe material of the Great Elixir fundamentally uses the true Oneness Water as its embryo, internally enclosing the upright Yang qi—just as in former days, the parents’ true qi, essence, and blood formed the embryonic sac. After three hundred days of transformation, the embryo is complete and the qi is full, the form and spirit fully prepared. The Embryonic Immortal resembles a millet grain, nurtured without deficiency. Initially, Yin retains Yang; next, Yang is used to refine Yin. Qi transforms into essence, essence into Mercury, Mercury into a pearl, the pearl into cinnabar, and cinnabar into the Golden Elixir. Once the Golden Elixir is achieved, true qi is naturally born. Refining qi into spirit, one attains transcendence, transforming into a Fire Dragon to emerge from the dark road, riding a Black Crane to enter the Peng Isle.\n\nLü said: \"Form uniting with form gives birth to form; qi uniting with qi gives birth to qi. The number does not exceed three hundred days. After the division of form, why do male and female appearances differ? And what is the color of one’s own cinnabar?\"",

      "translated_text": "Zhong said: \"When the forms of father and mother unite, the father’s essence advances first, while the mother’s blood follows later. If blood envelops essence, a daughter is formed—internally Yang yet externally Yin, resembling the mother, for blood lies on the outside. If the mother’s blood advances first and the father’s essence follows later, with essence enveloping blood, a son is formed—internally Yin yet externally Yang, resembling the father, for essence lies on the outside.\n\nBlood, originating from the heart, lacks the true Yang qi. Essence, born of the kidneys, possesses the true Yang qi. This true Yang qi is the root of Mercury, the true Unity of Water. When harmonized, it enters the Yellow Court. Mercury is boiled in Lead’s decoction, while Lead is refined by Mercury’s fire. Without Mercury, Lead cannot transform into the pure Yang qi.\n\nLü said: \"Lead resides in the kidneys, generating the primordial Yang qi. Within this qi lies the true Unity of Water, invisible to the eye. When Lead obtains Mercury—Mercury being the true Yang qi—this true Yang qi refines Lead. As Lead’s generative qi flourishes, it uplifts the true Unity of Water, enabling ascent.\n\nYet Mercury, being the true Yang qi, is the true Unity of Water that forms the embryonic sac. Conveyed into the Yellow Court, it becomes the union of Dragon and Tiger, Yin and Yang in perfect balance. If boiled in Lead’s decoction, excess Yin dissipates the true Yang—how then can the Great Medicine arise, or qi generate qi within?\"\n\nZhong said: \"When kidney qi merges with heart qi, qi at its extreme generates fluid. Within this fluid lies the true Yang qi, which pairs with the true Unity of Water. This is called the Tiger’s union, yielding a grain as small as a millet—named the Golden Elixir, the Great Medicine—conveyed into the Yellow Court.\n\nThe Yellow Court lies below the spleen and stomach, above the bladder, north of the heart, south of the kidneys, west of the liver, and east of the lungs. Above it is clear, below turbid; externally, it corresponds to the four colors. Its capacity holds two *sheng*, its pathways connect to the eight waters. The Medicine obtained dwells within day and night. If one gathers the Medicine but fails to apply the fire, the Medicine will dissipate and cannot be retained. If one applies the fire but fails to gather the Medicine, the Yang within Yin cannot be preserved, merely arousing kidney qi to warm and strengthen the lower origin.\n\nIf the Medicine is gathered at the proper time and the fire applied in due measure, one must first borrow qi from Lead to stoke the fire, thereby solidifying the Great Medicine and permanently anchoring it in the lower field—this is the method of gathering and supplementation. Refining Mercury to replenish the cinnabar field prolongs life and enhances longevity, enabling one to become an Earth Immortal.\n\nIf, however, one gathers the Medicine and extracts primordial Lead from behind the elbow to fly the Golden Essence, once Lead is drawn, Mercury must be added. Without adding Mercury, merely returning essence to replenish the brain, how can true qi be generated? Without true qi, how can the Yang spirit be achieved? Once Mercury is added, Lead must be drawn. Without drawing Lead, merely refining Mercury to replenish the cinnabar field, how can cinnabar transform? Without this transformation, how can the Golden Elixir be achieved?\n\nLü said on extraction and supplementation: Gathering the Medicine relies on the water within qi, while applying the fire borrows the qi within Lead. Ultimately, extracting Lead forms the Great Medicine; supplementing with Mercury can then replenish the cinnabar field.\n\nWhat is the principle of extraction and supplementation?\"\n\nZhong said: \"In ancient times, the supreme sages transmitted the Dao to humanity. The people of the distant past were simple and unadorned, obscure and unknowing, unable to comprehend the Great Dao. Heaven and Earth illustrated Yin and Yang, the proper ascent and descent of their qi, exchanging warmth and cold, heat and chill, so that the seasons followed their course. A year’s cycle completed, it began anew, never deviating from the Dao—thus Heaven and Earth endure.\n\nNot content that people remained ignorant of the great principle, confined to a single corner, they likened it to the workings of the sun and moon’s essence, their advance and retreat governed by the times of dawn, fullness, waning, and new moon. Their rising and setting proceeded without error; a month’s cycle completed, it began anew, never deviating from the Dao—thus the sun and moon endure.\n\nYet as cold comes and heat departs, heat departs and cold returns, people fail to grasp the proper ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth’s qi. The moon waxes full, then wanes; people indulge in endless desires, squandering their limited time. Wealth and luxury, when tallied, merely adorn the fleeting dream of life. Love and sorrow, when all is said and done, become debts for the next life. Before the song ends, bitterness arrives; as fame and profit peak, youth fades.\n\nThose who covet wealth and goods believe it will endure for ten thousand kalpas. Those who dote on children and grandchildren hope to remain together forever. Ceaseless greed and delusion, the vain pursuit of immortality—all dissipate the primordial Yang and scatter the true qi. Only when grave illness clings to the body do they cease their striving; only when the final hour arrives do they bow their heads.\n\nThe true immortals and supreme sages, pitying their plight and seeing them sink into deep ruin, wished for people to awaken to the Great Dao. They first expounded the principle of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang, their ascent and descent, then likened it to the sun and moon’s essence, their advance and retreat.\n\nYet some, failing to grasp the celestial mechanism, misconstrue the mysterious and subtle, comparing inner medicine to outer medicine, speaking of the inanimate as if it were animate. The inanimate refers to metals and minerals—outer medicine. The animate refers to qi and fluids—inner medicine. The vastness of Heaven and Earth, the brightness of the sun and moon, outer metals and minerals, inner qi and fluids—once gathered, they must be supplemented; once supplemented, they must be extracted. The principle of extraction and supplementation is the foundation of creation.\n\nAfter the winter solstice, Yang ascends from the earth, which extracts its Yin. Greater Yin is drawn to become Terminal Yin; Lesser Yang is added to become Yang Brightness. Terminal Yin is drawn to become Lesser Yin; Yang Brightness departs to become Greater Yang.

      "translated_text": "After the summer solstice, Yin descends from heaven, which extracts its Yang. Greater Yang is drawn to become Yang Brightness; Lesser Yin is added to become Terminal Yin. Yang Brightness is drawn to become Lesser Yang; Terminal Yin is added to become Greater Yin. Without this, heat would not transform into chill, nor chill into cold.\n\nThus, the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang give rise to the six qi, and this is the verification of extraction and supplementation. Just as the moon receives the sun’s essence and the sun transforms the moon’s spirit—during the first fifteen days, the moon extracts its spirit while the sun supplements its essence. Once the essence is full, its light illumines the earth below. Without this, there would be no waxing from new moon to first quarter, nor from first quarter to full moon. As the moon restores its Yin spirit and the sun withdraws its Yang essence—during the latter fifteen days—the sun extracts its essence while the moon supplements its spirit. Once its light fades and its Yin spirit is complete, there would be no waning from full moon to last quarter, nor from last quarter to new moon. Thus, the cyclical movement of the sun and moon gives rise to the nine and six, and this is the verification of extraction and supplementation.\n\nOrdinary people, failing to grasp the celestial mechanism and unable to fathom the profound principle, do not realize that the true immortals and highest sages—knowing that what the human heart cherishes is freedom from illness and longevity—refined metals and minerals into the great elixir. Knowing that what the human heart desires is gold and silver, they transformed lead and mercury into supreme treasures. Their original intent was to awaken the world to this great principle: even inanimate metals and minerals, when fired with precise timing and supplemented and extracted in measured cycles, can still prolong life and enhance vitality. How much more so, then, with the animate true Yang qi of one’s own body and the primordial water of the One, when one understands the moment of union and the method of gathering, accumulating day upon month, qi within qi, refining qi into spirit, and thus attaining liberation—this is a feat rare in all of history.\n\nYet few in the world attain such understanding. One must devote oneself wholeheartedly to practice, forsaking all external affairs, emulating the enduring constancy of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, and guiding deluded followers to turn their minds toward the Dao. Hence arose the discourse on outer medicine. Though sages and worthies of past and present have expounded these teachings, making them known to the world, people still fail to awaken. They deceive themselves and others, losing sight of the original intent of the ancient masters. They extract mercury from cinnabar, use mercury to transmute lead, dry lead with mercury, employ mercury to transform copper—heedless of their own lives, madly pursuing wealth, mutually praising one another under the pretense of cultivating the Dao, when in truth they covet profit and are fixated on the arts of gold and silver.\n\nThe ancient sages and immortals, compelled by circumstance, adapted their teachings to the capacities of beings, using lead and mercury as metaphors for inner alchemy. Lead and mercury, though derived from metals and minerals—lifeless substances—can still be transformed into treasure through the work of creation. How much more so, then, with the animate substances produced by one’s own body, which function like lead and mercury? Surely they, too, possess the power of creation. And if they possess such power, they are by no means inferior to those yellow and white substances.\n\nThose who uphold the Dao must delve deeply into this and not cling solely to external elixirs or the defense of elixir altars. Now, the lead within a person is the origin of Heaven and Earth, arising from the Great Beginning to form the Great Substance; it is the mother of the myriad things, emerging from the Great Substance to become the Great Simplicity. In its essence, it is metal within water; in its function, it is water within fire. It is the ancestor of the Five Phases and the root of the Great Dao. Thus, when gathering medicine, one supplements mercury, and to supplement mercury, one must extract lead—but this extraction of lead does not lie without. From the lower field it enters the upper field, called \"flying golden essence behind the elbow,\" or \"activating the river chariot to move dragon and tiger,\" or \"returning essence to replenish the brain and attain immortality.\"\n\nOnce lead is extracted afterward, mercury naturally descends from the middle. From the middle field it returns to the lower field, where dragon and tiger unite to transform into the yellow sprout. This is the inversion of the Five Phases. Thus, by extracting lead and supplementing mercury, one nurtures the immortal embryo—this is the reversal of the three fields. Without the inversion of the Five Phases, dragon and tiger do not unite; without the reversal of the three fields, the immortal embryo does not fill with qi. Extracting lead and supplementing mercury, after one hundred days the medicine’s power is complete; after two hundred days the sacred embryo is firm; after three hundred days the immortal embryo is perfected and true qi is born. Once true qi is born, refining qi into spirit, the work is fulfilled and form is forgotten—the immortal embryo transforms of itself, and this is called \"immortal.\"\n\nLü said: \"That which comes from metals and minerals is outer lead and outer mercury; through extraction and supplementation, it can become treasure. But that which arises from the true qi of one’s parents, stored in the kidneys, and becomes lead, and the medicine formed by the union of the true One and the correct Yang, transformed into mercury—through extraction and supplementation, can this generate spirit? Does true lead and true mercury also involve extraction and supplementation?\"\n\nZhong said: \"At first, one obtains mercury by using lead, but using lead is ultimately mistaken. Thus, one extracts it and enters the upper palace. The primordial qi is not transmitted; instead, essence returns to the brain. The mercury obtained daily, as Yin is exhausted and Yang is purified, transforms essence into cinnabar, and cinnabar into gold—this is called true lead. True lead is the true qi of one’s own body, obtained through union. True lead arises within true qi, the true water of the One within darkness. The five qi pay homage to the origin, and the three Yang gather at the crown. Formerly, golden essence descended into the cinnabar field, refined the form, and the body and bones took on a golden hue. Now, true lead ascends into the inner palace, and the body emits white light. From below to above, from above to below, returning the elixir and refining the form—all is the work of golden essence in cyclical movement. From front to back, from back to front, refining the body and merging qi—all is the work of true qi’s creation. Without extraction and supplementation, merely gathering medicine and advancing the fire in daily practice, how could such efficacy be achieved?\"\n\nLü said: \"In extracting and supplementing, how can one ensure that ascent and descent are measured, and front and back are without error?\"\n\nZhong said: \"When it is time to ascend, do not descend; when it is time to extract, do not supplement. In ascent and descent, there must be no deviation by even a hair’s breadth—this is the power of the river chariot.\"",
      "overlap_context": " gathered, they must be supplemented; once supplemented, they must be extracted. The principle of extraction and supplementation is the foundation of creation.\n\nAfter the winter solstice, Yang ascends from the earth, which extracts its Yin. Greater Yin is drawn to become Terminal Yin; Lesser Yang is added to become Yang Brightness. Terminal Yin is drawn to become Lesser Yin; Yang Brightness departs to become Greater Yang. Without this, cold would not transform into warmth, nor warmth into heat.\"",

      "translated_text": "**On the River Chariot**\n\nLü said: \"What is this so-called River Chariot?\"\n\nZhong said: \"In ancient times, a man of will and wisdom observed how floating clouds could obscure the sun and thus fashioned a canopy to harness yin; how fallen leaves could drift upon the waves and thus devised a boat to bear objects; how tumbleweeds, borne by the wind, turned endlessly without cease—and from this, he created the chariot. Now, the chariot as an object embodies the image of heaven and earth, its wheels and hubs likened to the sun and moon. Advanced Daoists draw their analogy from the chariot. Yet while a chariot travels upon land and turns across the earth, the River Chariot has its own rationale. Within the human body, yang is scant and yin abundant, and where water prevails, the chariot takes its meaning from conveyance, while the river symbolizes the dominance of yin. Thus, this River Chariot does not move upon land but upon water. From above to below, now behind, now ahead, it is harnessed within the Eight Jewels’ domain and driven through the Four Seas. Ascending to heaven, it enters Kunlun; once the crossing is complete, it descends to the Phoenix Tower. It carries primordial yang straight into the Southern Palace, bears true qi in winding return to the Palace of Longevity, traversing the Nine Provinces without pause, patrolling the Three Fields without rest. When dragon and tiger unite, the Yellow Dame is driven into the Yellow Court; when lead and mercury part, the Metal Youth is conveyed into the Golden Palace. A thousand streams of Jade Spring are transported in but half a day’s work; a single flask of Golden Liquid is borne past in the time it takes to ask. Without this chariot’s conveyance, how could union be achieved? Following the seasons and responding to the nodes, one must rely on this chariot to bear the work—only then will efficacy appear. In nurturing yang and refining yin to establish the task, one must rely on this chariot to bear it—only then will there be no error. Before heaven and earth are purified, if yin and yang are to interact, it is the work of this chariot. Before the cosmos is complete, if qi and blood are to circulate, it is the work of this chariot. From without to within, it conveys the pure qi of heaven and earth to draw forth the primordial yang of one’s own palace. From the mortal to the sacred, it transports the true qi of yin and yang to refine and replenish the primordial spirit of one’s own body. Its merits cannot be fully recounted.\"\n\nLü said: \"The River Chariot has such wondrous uses—may I ask, in principle, what within the human body constitutes it? Once obtained, how is it employed?\"\n\nZhong said: \"The River Chariot arises from the true qi of the northern direction, the water’s center. The kidneys store true qi, and the upright qi born of true qi is called the River Chariot. Its workings are rarely heard of in past or present, for true immortals keep it secret and do not speak of it. When Qian twice seeks Kun and gives birth to Kan, Kan is fundamentally water, the essence of yin. Yang, having sought yin, returns bearing yin to restore its position, passing through Gen, Zhen, and Xun. With yang seeking yin and thereby drawing yin, it conveys yin into Li, where it receives yang and is born—this is the River Chariot bearing yin into the yang palace. When Kun twice seeks Qian and gives birth to Li, Li is fundamentally fire, the essence of yang. Yin, having sought yang, returns embracing yang to restore its position, passing through Kun, Dui, and Qian. With yin seeking yang and thereby drawing yang, it conveys yang into Kan, where it receives yin and is born—this is the River Chariot bearing yang into the yin palace. When medicine is gathered from the Nine Palaces above and brought down into the Yellow Court, when lead is drawn from the Winding River below and borne upward into the Inner Sanctum—Jade Liquid and Golden Liquid are the foundation of the returned elixir, and their conveyance refines the form, causing water to ascend. Sovereign Fire and People’s Fire are the basis of refining the form, and their conveyance fires the elixir, causing fire to descend. The Five Qi’s audience at the origin occurs at its appointed time; the Three Flowers’ gathering at the crown occurs on its appointed day. When spirits gather, demons multiply—bearing true fire to burn the body extinguishes the Three Corpses. When the medicine is complete and the sea runs dry, conveying the rosy nectar to bathe, one enters water without ripples. Such are the workings of the River Chariot.\"\n\nLü said: \"The River Chariot, born of the northern direction’s upright qi, turns without end, bearing and loading yin and yang, each with its own accomplishment—its labors are not uniform. I beg you, Master, to explain in detail.\"\n\nZhong said: \"The Five Phases circulate in return, endlessly revolving. To silently grasp the art of inversion, exchanging dragon and tiger to transform the Yellow Sprout—this is the Lesser River Chariot. Flying the Golden Essence behind the elbow, returning essence to the Mud Pill Palace, drawing lead and adding mercury to form the Great Medicine—this is the Greater River Chariot. If dragon and tiger exchange to transform the Yellow Sprout, if lead and mercury unite to form the Great Medicine, if true qi is born and the Five Qi pay audience at the Central Origin, if the yang spirit is perfected and the Three Spirits ascend to the Inner Sanctum—then the Purple Gold Elixir is complete, ever like a pair of soaring black cranes; the White Jade Mercury is settled, steadfast as a leaping fire dragon. A myriad golden rays envelop the mortal frame in radiance; a single jade tree blooms with fresh, resplendent blossoms. Whether emerging or entering, one moves freely; whether departing or arriving, one encounters no obstruction. Bearing the spirit into the body, one blends with the passing age; transforming the sacred and leaving the mundane, one becomes a feathered transcendent—this is called the Purple Chariot. These two chariots are distinguished by upper, middle, and lower accomplishments, thus called the Three Accomplishments. This refers to the verification of their efficacy, unlike the Three Vehicles of the Buddhist teachings—the Goat Cart, the Deer Cart, and the Great Ox Cart. In Daoist terms, beyond the River Chariot, there are three further chariots: When gathering fire and directing the mind with intent to attack illness, it is called the Daily Chariot. When the crossing is complete, from above to below, yin and yang unite in proper harmony, water and fire coexist, and in stillness one hears the sound of thunder—this is called the Thunder Chariot. If the mind becomes entangled in phenomena, the nature is enslaved by emotion, and one is moved by external things to scatter the true yang qi, dissipating it from within to without without cease—over time, qi weakens and the body declines, leading to aging. Or if the Eight Evils and Five Epidemics are borne inward, true qi and primordial yang cannot resist, and one grows old, falls ill, and dies—this is called the Broken Chariot.\"",

      "translated_text": "Master Zhongli Quan of Perfected Yang, styled Yunfang, records the discourse of Master Lü Dongbin of Perfected Yang, styled Yunpin, as collected by Master Shi Jianwu of Perfected Hua-Yang on the topic of the Returned Elixir.\n\nLü said: \"Refining form into qi, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit to merge with the Dao—these I dare not presume to comprehend. What, then, is meant by the Returned Elixir?\"\n\nZhongli replied: \"The so-called elixir is not a color; red and yellow cannot attain it. The so-called elixir is not a taste; sweetness and harmony cannot conjoin it. The elixir is the Cinnabar Field. There are three Cinnabar Fields: the upper field is the abode of spirit, the middle field the mansion of qi, and the lower field the chamber of essence. From essence arises qi, qi resides in the middle cinnabar, and from qi arises spirit, spirit abides in the upper cinnabar. True water and true qi conjoin to form essence, and the two essences reside in the lower cinnabar. All who uphold the Dao possess these three cinnabar fields. Yet, though qi is born in the kidneys, it has not yet ascended to the Central Origin; though spirit is stored in the heart, it has not yet transcended the Upper Court. This is what is meant by the essence-spirit’s failure to return and unite. Though one may possess the three cinnabar fields, they ultimately remain useless.\"\n\nLü said: \"Within the mysterious lies the even more mysterious. All people possess a destiny, yet if there is no essence within that destiny, it is not one’s own qi but the primal yang of one’s parents. Without essence, there is no qi; it is not one’s own spirit but the primal spirit of one’s parents. Essence, qi, and spirit are the treasures of the three fields—how then can they be made to abide perpetually within the three palaces of upper, middle, and lower?\"\n\nZhongli and Lü said: \"From the kidneys arises qi, and within qi lies the True One’s water. If this water returns to the lower cinnabar, essence nourishes the numinous root, and qi naturally arises. From the heart arises fluid, and within fluid lies the qi of Correct Yang. If this qi returns to the middle cinnabar, qi nourishes the numinous source, and spirit naturally arises. Gathering the numinous as spirit and merging spirit into the Dao to return to the upper cinnabar—only then is transcendence achieved.\"\n\nLü said: \"There are upper, middle, and lower cinnabar fields. To return is to go back to where one came from—hence the term Returned Elixir. The principle of the Returned Elixir is profound and subtle; pray, expound upon it in detail.\"\n\nZhongli said: \"There is the Lesser Returned Elixir, the Greater Returned Elixir, the Sevenfold Returned Elixir, the Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir, the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir, the Jade Liquid Returned Elixir, the elixir that returns the lower cinnabar to the upper, the elixir that returns the upper cinnabar to the middle, the elixir that returns the middle cinnabar to the lower, the elixir that returns yang to yin, and the elixir that returns yin to yang. These differ not only in name but also in the timing and method of their practice.\"\n\nLü said: \"What is the Lesser Returned Elixir?\"\n\nZhongli said: \"The Lesser Returned Elixir originates in the lower origin. The lower origin is the ruler of the five viscera and the root of the three fields. Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, and metal generates water—thus they mutually engender. There is no deviation in timing; when one should generate, it draws forth what has not yet been generated, like a mother’s love for her child. Fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, and water overcomes fire—thus they mutually overcome. There is no loss of measure; when one should overcome, it supplements what has not yet been overcome, like the union of husband and wife. Qi and fluid circulate in a cycle: from midnight to noon, yin and yang arise; from dawn to dusk, yin halts. In the span of one day and night, it returns to the lower cinnabar. Each cycle of return is called the Lesser Returned Elixir. Those who uphold the Dao gather the medicine and advance the fire to complete the lower cinnabar—this is the principle behind it.\"\n\nLü said: \"Now that the Lesser Returned Elixir is understood, what is the Greater Returned Elixir?\"\n\nZhongli said: \"When dragon and tiger conjoin, they transform into the yellow sprout; when lead is drawn and mercury added, the great medicine is formed. In the Palace of Dark Warrior, the golden essence first stirs; beneath the Mountain of Jade Capital, the true qi just ascends. The river chariot courses over the ridge, and the jade liquid irrigates the central thoroughfare. From the lower field it enters the upper field, and from the upper field it returns to the lower field. The posterior rises and the anterior gathers, completing the cycle—this is called the Greater Returned Elixir. Those who uphold the Dao arouse the dragon and tiger to soar as golden essence, nurture the immortal embryo to generate true mercury, and thus complete the middle cinnabar—this is the principle behind it.\"\n\nLü said: \"Now that the Greater Returned Elixir is understood, what are the Sevenfold Returned Elixir and the Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir?\"\n\nZhongli said: \"The numbers of generation and completion in the five phases total fifty-five. Heaven is one, earth is two; heaven is three, earth is four; heaven is five, earth is six; heaven is seven, earth is eight; heaven is nine, earth is ten. One, three, five, seven, and nine are yang, totaling twenty-five; two, four, six, eight, and ten are yin, totaling thirty. Beginning with the kidneys as water, the numbers of generation are: water one, fire two, wood three, metal four, earth five—these are the generating numbers of the five phases, three yang and two yin. Beginning with the kidneys as water, the numbers of completion are: water six, fire seven, wood eight, metal nine, earth ten—these are the completing numbers of the five phases, three yin and two yang. Within the human body, the Way of the five phases’ generation and completion is fully present. Water corresponds to the kidneys, which hold one and six; fire corresponds to the heart, which holds two and seven; wood corresponds to the liver, which holds three and eight; metal corresponds to the lungs, which hold four and nine; earth corresponds to the spleen, which holds five and ten. Each viscus possesses both yin and yang. Yin reaches its peak at eight and flourishes at two; thus, when qi arrives at the liver, the residual yin of the kidneys is exhausted, and when qi reaches the heart, the Supreme Ultimate generates yin, for two resides in the heart while eight resides in the liver. Yang reaches its end at nine and flourishes at one; thus, when fluid arrives at the lungs, the residual yang of the heart is exhausted, and when fluid reaches the kidneys, the Supreme Ultimate generates yang, for one resides in the kidneys while nine resides in the lungs. Those who uphold the Dao first conjoin dragon and tiger to gather the heart’s qi of Correct Yang—the qi of Correct Yang is the heart’s seven. Seven returns to the Central Origin and enters the lower field, nurturing the immortal embryo before returning to the heart—this is called the Sevenfold Returned Elixir.\"",

      "translated_text": "When the two and eight of yin dissolve, true qi arises and the heart is devoid of yin, thus severing the two; the Great Elixir is achieved and the liver is devoid of yin, thus severing the eight. Once the two and eight of yin dissolve, the nine and three of yang may flourish. When the liver severs its yang to assist the heart, it becomes three; the liver’s qi flourishes. When the seven returns to the heart, severing the lung’s fluid, and the lung’s nine revolves to assist the heart, the nine and three of yang flourish—this is the Ninefold Revolved Elixir.\n\nMaster Lü says: The Sevenfold Return refers to the heart’s yang returning to the heart and residing in the Central Elixir. The Ninefold Revolve refers to the lung’s yang, originally born of the heart, revolving and returning to the heart, also residing in the Central Elixir. Having understood the Sevenfold Return and Ninefold Revolve, what then is the meaning of \"golden fluid and jade fluid,\" the exchange among the upper, central, and lower fields, the interplay of yin and yang in the returning elixir?\n\nMaster Zhong says: Former worthies and ancient sages often spoke of lung fluid entering the lower field as the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir, and heart fluid entering the lower field as the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir. Though this discourse is not without subtlety, it does not fully reveal the profound mechanism. For the lung generates the kidneys—metal engenders water—yet how can metal entering water be called a returned elixir? The kidneys restrain the heart—water overcomes fire—yet how can water entering fire be called a returned elixir?\n\nThe golden fluid is the lung’s fluid. As the fetal sac, the lung’s fluid contains dragon and tiger, safeguarding and conveying them within the Yellow Court. When the Great Elixir nears completion, it is drawn from behind the elbow and ascends, the lung’s fluid entering the upper palace, then descending to the Central Elixir, and from the Central Elixir returning to the lower field—thus it is called the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir.\n\nThe jade fluid is the kidney’s fluid. Following the original qi upward to the Jade Pond, it scatters into blossoms of jade and refines into white snow. If it is gathered from the central field into the lower field when the elixir is present, it bathes the immortal embryo; if it is ascended from the central field into the four limbs to refine the form, it transforms the mortal bones. Neither ascending nor gathering, it circulates and returns—thus it is called the water of one, its water following yang to ascend, the yin returning as yang elixir. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born, and within yin resides the qi of Correct Yang; this qi follows yin downward—this is the yang returning as yin elixir.\n\nReplenishing the brain and refining the crown, the lower returns to the upper; completing the hexagram and irrigating, the upper returns to the center; firing the elixir and advancing the flame, the center returns to the lower; refining the body and incinerating the form, the lower returns to the center. The Five Phases invert, the Three Fields revolve, mutually exchanging until the form is transformed into qi, qi refined into spirit. From the lower field it ascends to the central field, from the central field to the upper field, from the upper field out through the Gate of Heaven, casting off the mortal frame to enter the ranks of sages and immortals—only then is the work of the Three Ascensions complete.

      "translated_text": "Lü said: \"Now that the returning elixir is understood, may I hear of the principle of refining the form?\"\nZhong replied: \"When a person is born, form and spirit serve as outer and inner, spirit being the master of form, form the dwelling of spirit. The essence within form generates qi, and qi generates spirit. From fluids arises qi, and from qi arise fluids—these are the mother and child within form. Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water; qi transmits between mother and child, fluids circulate between husband and wife—these are the yin and yang within form. Water transforms into fluid, fluid into blood, blood into essence, all born of yin receiving yang. If yin and yang are improperly balanced, then tears, mucus, saliva, and sweat issue uncontrollably, and yin loses its generative power. Qi transforms into essence, essence into pearl, pearl into mercury, mercury into cinnabar, all formed of yang receiving yin. If yin and yang are improperly balanced, then illness, aging, suffering, and death ensue, and yang cannot achieve completion. Without yang, yin cannot be born; without yin, yang cannot be completed.\n\nThose who follow the Dao cultivate yang but not yin, refine the self but not external things. At the inception of receiving qi in one’s own body, the true qi of father and mother unite to form essence and blood as the fetal sac, lodging the embryo within the mother’s purely yin palace. Yin generates yin, and through form, form is shaped. When the fetus is complete and qi is full, the six-foot frame is entirely yin, possessing but a single point of primordial yang. If one wishes for long life and immortality, refining the form to abide in the world and endure through eons; if one wishes to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood, refining the form into qi to attain a body beyond the body—\n\nLü said: \"Form is image, yin; yin has substance and engages in activity. To prevent form from transforming into qi and transcending the mortal frame to enter the ranks of sages is the supreme method of refinement. By preserving qi within form and nourishing form with qi, one achieves minor benefits of peace and longevity, and major benefits of preserving form to abide in the world. The aged return to youth, the not-yet-aged maintain their complexion and attain long life—three hundred and sixty years as one year, thirty-six thousand years as one kalpa, thirty-six thousand kalpas as one great kalpa. Through countless great kalpas, enduring as long as heaven and earth, such is the verification of refining the form.\n\nYet the principle of refining the form, the mechanism of creation and transformation, yields such verification—may I hear of it?\"\nZhong said: \"When a person’s form is complete, the fetus is perfected in three hundred days. After birth, qi is full in five thousand days. The five-foot-five-inch body corresponds to the generative numbers of the Five Phases. Variations in size are measured by inches, with length and proportion harmonized. Above the heart lies the Nine Heavens, below the kidneys the Nine Earths. From kidneys to heart is eight inches and four fen, from heart to the first ring of the *chonglou* eight inches and four fen, from the first ring of the *chonglou* to the crown eight inches and four fen. From kidneys to crown spans three feet and five inches two fen. The primordial qi fills this in one day and night through three hundred and twenty cycles, each cycle two feet and five inches two fen, totaling eighty-one zhang of primordial qi, corresponding to the pure yang number of nine nines.\n\nThe distance between heart and kidneys accords with the proper separation of heaven and earth. From kidneys to crown spans two feet and five inches, further aligning with the pure yang number of five fives in the Five Phases. Thus, primordial qi follows exhalation to exit. Upon exiting, the constructive and defensive qi all communicate with the upright qi of heaven and earth, responding to seasons and nodes, now uniting, now parting, their measure boundless, following inhalation to enter. Upon entering, the channels and network vessels all open. With each exhalation and inhalation, the true qi of heaven, earth, and humanity circulate before the Twelve Stories. One departure and one return constitute one breath. Between day and night, a person has thirteen thousand five hundred breaths. Dividing them, there are thirteen thousand five hundred exhalations—what is exhaled is one’s own primordial qi, issuing from within—and thirteen thousand five hundred inhalations—what is inhaled is the upright qi of heaven and earth, entering from without.\n\nIf the root is firm and primordial qi undiminished, between exhalation and inhalation one can seize the upright qi of heaven and earth. Refining qi with qi, it disperses to fill the Four Great Elements. The clear becomes constructive, the turbid defensive; all flow unimpeded. The vertical are channels, the horizontal network vessels; all attain ease and comfort. Cold and heat cannot harm, toil and hardship cannot threaten. The body is light, the bones sturdy, the qi fresh, the spirit clear. One eternally preserves boundless longevity and remains forever unaging. If, however, the root is not firm, essence exhausted and qi weakened, above the primordial qi is already depleted, below the original palace unsupplemented—then the qi of heaven and earth that is inhaled issues forth in great torrents. The eighty-one zhang of primordial qi diminish by nine nines, no longer belonging to oneself but instead taken by heaven and earth. How then can one seize the upright qi of heaven and earth? With accumulation, yin flourishes and yang declines, qi weakens and illness arises, qi exhausted and death follows, returning to the wheel of rebirth.\n\nLü said: \"How can primordial qi be prevented from dissipating, so that by refining the bodily form one may seize the upright qi of heaven and earth and endure through great kalpas?\"\nZhong said: \"To achieve victory, troops must be strong; for the people to be secure, the state must be prosperous. The troops are primordial qi. Internally, they dissolve the yin of bodily form; externally, they seize the qi of heaven and earth. The state is one’s own body. The tangible aspects of the body are abundant and ever in surplus; the intangible aspects are firm and never deficient. With ten thousand households open, none precede or follow—this is how one refines the substance and incinerates the body, now ascending, now descending, to nourish yang and dissolve yin. The firing of heaven and earth has its proper timing; can the forging of qi and fluids lack its daily regimen?\"",

      "translated_text": "With jade liquid one refines the form, relying on the armored dragon to ascend and fly—white snow fills the dusty flesh. With golden liquid one refines the form, pursuing the thunder chariot to descend—golden light brims in the outer chamber.\n\nLü said: \"The principles of refining the form I now roughly understand. But what are golden liquid and jade liquid?\"\nZhong said: \"When refining the form with golden liquid, the bones assume a golden hue and the body emits golden light. Golden petals scatter in the void—this is when the five qi return to the origin, the three yang gather at the crown, the moment to transcend the mortal frame and the day the great golden elixir is accomplished. When refining the form with jade liquid, the flesh suffuses with yang’s cream, the body becomes like a jade tree, jasper flowers and jade herbs transform the mortal frame, and radiance dazzles the eye. Riding the wind, one soars freely, the form becoming qi. Though followers of the Dao may know the method of returning the elixir, the work of refining the form is no small matter.\n\nWhen the jade liquid returns the elixir to bathe the embryonic immortal, it ascends and moves, carried by the river chariot through the four great elements. It begins in the liver: the liver receives it, and at once light fills the eyes, making them dark as lacquer. Next the heart: the heart receives it, and the mouth produces numinous liquid that becomes white snow. Next the spleen: the spleen receives it, and the flesh becomes like congealed fat, all scars vanishing. Next the lungs: the lungs receive it, and the nose detects celestial fragrance, the complexion restored to youth. Next the kidneys: the kidneys receive it, returning it to its original palace—within the ears, the sound of strings and pipes is ever heard, and at the temples, the color of gray hair is forever banished. Such is the refining of form with jade liquid.\n\nAs for refining the form with golden liquid, it cannot be compared to this. When the elixir first returns but has not yet fully returned, it meets the sovereign fire in the hexagram *Already Across*. Once the elixir has returned and rises again, it contends with true yin in what is called *Refining the Substance*. Earth fundamentally overcomes water, yet when golden liquid is in earth, it causes the Yellow Emperor to turn his light back to unite with the Great Yin. Fire fundamentally overcomes metal, yet when golden liquid is in fire, it causes the Red Child to tend the furnace, spontaneously generating purple qi. Within water, fire arises; within yang, yin dissolves. The golden elixir transforms within the Yellow Court, refining the yang spirit amid the five qi. In the liver, green qi surges; in the lungs, white light appears; in the heart, red radiance manifests; in the kidneys, black qi ascends; in the spleen, yellow color emerges. The five qi return to the Middle Origin, following the sovereign fire to transcend the inner court.\n\nThe yang within the yin of the Lower Origin—its yang is without yin—ascends and gathers in the spirit palace. The yang within the yang of the Middle Origin—its yang is unborn—ascends and gathers in the spirit temple. The great medicine of the Yellow Court, with yin exhausted and pure yang remaining, ascends and gathers in the spirit palace. The five fluids return to the Lower Origin, the five qi return to the Middle Origin, the three yang return to the Upper Origin. Once the return to the origin is complete and the merit of three thousand [days] is fulfilled, now cranes dance within the crown, now dragons fly within the body. One hears the clear music of dawn, sees immortal blossoms raining down, lingers in the Purple Court, and inhales the rich fragrance of true incense. With three thousand merits fulfilled, one is no longer a person of the dusty world. As the incense in the censer burns away, one becomes a guest of Penglai and Yingzhou—this is what is called transcending the mortal to enter sagehood, shedding the form to ascend as an immortal.\n\n**On the Return to the Origin**\nLü said: \"The principles of refining the form I have now understood. May I hear of this *return to the origin*?\"\nZhong said: \"When the great medicine is nearly accomplished, the jade liquid returns the elixir to bathe the embryonic immortal. Once true qi is born, it rushes upward with the jade liquid to transform the dusty bones—this is called *refining the form with jade liquid*. Later, when golden essence flies up from behind the elbow and the river chariot enters the inner court, moving from above to middle, from middle to below, the golden liquid returns the elixir to refine the golden cinnabar. The five qi return to the origin, the three yang gather at the crown—this is refining qi into spirit, not merely refining the form to abide in the world.\n\nThe *return to the origin*—few in past or present have known it. Even if one knows, sages and worthies do not speak of it, for it is the method of true immortals’ great accomplishment, the subtle mechanism hidden in heaven and earth, the esoteric matter of the Three Clarities, the mysterious principle beyond words and images, the wondrous truth of no-question and no-response. I fear your resolve may not be steadfast, your study not single-minded, your heart not tranquil, your inquiry not earnest. Light words and casual speech would only bring upon me the fault of leaking sacred secrets, to the benefit of neither of us.\"\n\nLü said: \"At first, I awakened to true immortals and recognized the great Dao. Next, I understood the seasons and grasped the celestial mechanism. I distinguished the true sources of water and fire, knew that dragon and tiger do not arise from liver and lungs. I examined the great principles of withdrawal and addition, discerned that lead and mercury are not the same as Kan and Li. The art of inverting the five phases I have received your instruction in; the mechanism of reversing the three fields I have again thanked you for expounding. The principles of returning the elixir and refining the form I have thoroughly grasped; the method of immortality and deathlessness I deeply understand. Yet the origin of transcending the mortal to enter sagehood, the way of shedding the form to ascend as an immortal, lies in refining qi to return to the origin. May you deign to briefly reveal the essentials of this *return to the origin*?\"\n\nZhong said: \"The Dao is originally formless. When the great origin manifests simplicity, the Upper Clarity and Lower Turbidity unite as one. Once the great simplicity divides, the primordial chaos first separates into heaven and earth. Within heaven and earth, east, west, south, and north array the five directions. Each direction has its own emperor, each emperor has two children—one yang and one yin—called the two qi, which mutually generate and complete each other to form the five phases. The five phases mutually generate and complete each other to establish the six qi, called the three yin and three yang.\n\nBy this reasoning, when a person first receives the embryo, essence and qi are one. Once essence and qi separate, they lodge in the two kidneys. The left kidney is called *xuan*, *xuan* ascends qi and transmits it upward to the liver. The right kidney is called *pin*, *pin* receives fluid and transmits it downward to the bladder.\"",
      "overlap_context": "; externally, they seize the qi of heaven and earth. The state is one’s own body. The tangible aspects of the body are abundant and ever in surplus; the intangible aspects are firm and never deficient. With ten thousand households open, none precede or follow—this is how one refines the substance and incinerates the body, now ascending, now descending, to nourish yang and dissolve yin. The firing of heaven and earth has its proper timing; can the forging of qi and fluids lack its daily regimen?\"",

      "translated_text": "The *xuan* and *pin* originate from the midst of nothingness, transforming non-being into being. They are the true qi of father and mother, received into the realm of pure yin. Thus it is said: \"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the *xuan-pin*. The gate of the *xuan-pin* may be compared to the root of heaven and earth.\"\n\nThe *xuan-pin* are the two kidneys. From the kidneys arise the five viscera, and the six bowels are complete therein. Among them:\n- The liver is Wood, called *jia-yi*, comparable to the Azure Emperor of the east;\n- The heart is Fire, called *bing-ding*, comparable to the Vermilion Emperor of the south;\n- The lungs are Metal, called *geng-xin*, comparable to the White Emperor of the west;\n- The spleen is Earth, called *wu-ji*, comparable to the Yellow Emperor of the center;\n- The kidneys are Water, called *ren-gui*, comparable to the Black Emperor of the north.\n\nWhen a person is first born, there is no form or image—only one yin and one yang. Once the embryo is complete and the intestines and stomach form, the six qi divide into three yang and three yin.\n\nOne qi moves the five phases, and the five phases move the six qi. First, one must recognize yin and yang: within yang there is yang-within-yin, and within yin there is yin-within-yang. Next, one must recognize Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, wherein there is Fire-within-Water, Water-within-Fire, Metal-within-Water, Wood-within-Metal, Fire-within-Wood, and Earth-within-Fire. In humans, these mutually interact and combine, so the two qi divide into six qi, and the great Dao scatters into the five phases.\n\nAfter the winter solstice, when one yang arises, yang is born in the lands of the five directions. One emperor presides over its mandate, while the other four assist. If, after the spring mandate has taken effect, the Black Emperor does not withdraw his command, the cold cannot transform into warmth; if the Vermilion Emperor does not prepare his mandate, the warmth cannot transform into heat. After the summer solstice, when one yin arises, yin descends in the heavens of the five directions. One emperor presides over its mandate, while the other four assist. If, after the autumn mandate has taken effect, the Vermilion Emperor does not withdraw his command, the heat cannot transform into chill; if the Black Emperor does not prepare his mandate, the chill cannot transform into cold.\n\nAt the winter solstice, yang is born in the earth and pays homage to heaven with its qi. At the summer solstice, yin is born in heaven and pays homage to earth with its qi. Those who uphold the Dao must deeply investigate this principle.\n\nBetween the sun and moon, when one yang first arises, the qi of the five viscera pay homage to the Middle Origin. When one yin first arises, the fluids of the five viscera pay homage to the Lower Origin. Within yin there is yang, within yang there is yang, and within the midst of yin and yang there is yang—these three yang ascend to pay homage to the Inner Court. The spirit of the heart returns to the Heavenly Palace; all these are those who pay homage to the Origin.\n\nLü said: \"When yang arises, the five qi pay homage to the Middle Origin; when yin arises, the five fluids pay homage to the Lower Origin. If the yang-within-yang, the yang-within-yin, and the yang-within-the-midst-of-yin-and-yang ascend to pay homage to the Upper Origin, even those who cultivate this constantly—how can they transcend and escape the mundane world?\"\n\nZhong said: \"If one uses the primordial yang qi to ascend and pay homage to the Middle Origin at the time when one yang first arises, all people are like this. If one accumulates qi to generate fluids and descends to pay homage to the Lower Origin at the time when one yin first arises, all people are like this. If one practices in this way, one cannot transcend. Yet those who wish to transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood, to shed their form and ascend as immortals, must first unite dragon and tiger to form the Great Medicine. Once the Great Medicine is formed, true qi is born. When true qi is born, one uses the year to determine the month, the month to fix waxing and waning, the month to determine the day, the day to count the governing phase, the day to determine the hour, and the hour to fix the breath count.\n\nNurture yang with yang, ensuring no yin lingers within yang. Temper yin with yang, ensuring no yang scatters within yin. In spring, the liver is strong and the spleen weak; in summer, the heart is strong and the lungs weak; in autumn, the lungs are strong and the liver weak; in winter, the kidneys are strong and the heart weak. For humans, the kidneys are the root. In every season, the spleen is strong while the kidneys are weak—only the kidneys suffer harm in the four seasons. This is why people often fall ill.\n\nWhen *jia-yi* governs in the liver, guard against the spleen qi’s inactivity. When *bing-ding* governs in the heart, guard against the lung qi’s inactivity. When *wu-ji* governs in the spleen, guard against the kidney qi’s inactivity. When *geng-xin* governs in the lungs, guard against the liver qi’s inactivity. When *ren-gui* governs in the kidneys, guard against the heart qi’s inactivity. When one qi is abundant and another weak, one viscus flourishes while another declines—this is why people often fall ill.\n\nThe heart qi sprouts in *hai*, is born in *yin*, flourishes in *si*, and weakens in *shen*. The liver qi sprouts in *shen*, is born in *hai*, flourishes in *yin*, and weakens in *si*. The lung qi sprouts in *yin*, is born in *si*, flourishes in *shen*, and weakens in *hai*. The kidney qi sprouts in *si*, is born in *shen*, flourishes in *hai*, and weakens in *yin*. The spleen qi follows the liver in spring, the heart in summer, the lungs in autumn, and the kidneys in winter. People who do not understand daily practice do not know the times of growth, flourishing, strength, and weakness—this is why they often fall ill.\n\nWhen the three yang of the sun, moon, and hour gather, refine yang so that yin does not arise. When the three yin of the month, day, and hour gather, nurture yang so that yang does not scatter. Moreover, once true qi is born, use the pure yang qi to temper the qi of the five viscera without ceasing, bringing forth their original color. With one ascent, reach the Heavenly Pool.\n\nFirst, with the kidneys’ absence of yin, the Nine Rivers are without waves. Next, with the liver’s absence of yin, the Eight Passes are eternally sealed. Then, with the lungs’ absence of yin, Metal and Fire share a furnace. Next, with the spleen’s absence of yin, the Jade Gate does not open. Finally, the true qi ascends, and the four qi gather into one. Even if the Golden Fluid descends, a cup of water cannot overcome the fire of a cartload of kindling.

      "translated_text": "Still the breath and turn the gaze inward, the mind undivided, spirit and consciousness both wondrous. In stillness, one constantly hears music—like a dream yet not a dream, as if dwelling in a realm of emptiness and nothingness. The scenery and vistas differ from the dusty world; their splendor and beauty surpass the mortal realm. Towers and palaces, jade-green tiles wreathed in mist, pearls and kingfisher feathers in brocade, fragrant incense forming ranks—at this moment, one is said to have transcended the Inner Court. Only then does the yang spirit gather and return to the Upper Cinnabar, refining the spirit to become an immortal and merge with the Great Dao.\n\nWith a single strike at Heaven’s Gate, the Dharma-body appears enveloped in golden light. Amidst the depths of blossoming flowers sits the mortal form, traversing the void as if walking a level plain, a thousand miles no farther than an outstretched arm. Should one return again to the original body, spirit and form unite, and their longevity equals that of heaven and earth. Should one grow weary of dwelling in the dusty world, one may lodge in a mortal womb and return to the Ten Isles, where at the Purple Mansion of the Supreme Tenuity, the True Lords verify one’s native place, compare names, and assess the merit of one’s deeds. One then dwells among the Three Islands, roaming forever beyond the wind and dust, a state called \"transcending the dust and shedding the mortal\"—superior to mere worldly existence.\n\nLü said: Refining the form only prolongs life in the world; refining qi alone enables ascent to immortality. Yet people fail to grasp the profound mechanism: without the elixir, they prematurely practice embryonic breathing, forcibly retaining it in the abdomen. Some accumulate frigid qi and fall ill; others stir false yang and invite disease. Though their practice aims at longevity, such delusion not only fails to prevent illness but may even cause it. They do not realize that once the Embryonic Immortal is achieved, true qi arises, and embryonic breathing follows naturally. Embryonic breathing refines qi; refining qi perfects the spirit. Yet refining qi requires careful attention to the month within the year, the day within the month, and the hour within the day. One must sit in a quiet chamber, free from worldly concerns and distractions. At this time, any lingering thoughts or attachments must be dispelled.\n\nBut if deluded thoughts persist, if wisdom leaks, if the aspiration for immortality wavers and the mind remains unsettled, what then is to be done?\n\nZhong said: Union has its proper time, practice has its proper method. Follow the time, enact the method, seek the Dao through the method, and success will come swiftly—easier than turning one’s palm. From ancient times to the present, those who have attained mastery close their eyes and still their hearts to enter the realm of the Inaudible and Invisible. Truly, through inward contemplation, the spirit and consciousness become free.\n\n**On Inward Contemplation**\n\nLü said: May I hear of the principle of inward contemplation?\n\nZhong said: The methods of inward contemplation, sitting in forgetfulness, and visualization were employed by some of the former worthies and sages but not by others. They feared the mind’s restlessness, like a monkey or a galloping horse, lest it be swayed by external things and lose its resolve. Thus, they established images within the void, rendering the ears unhearing, the eyes unseeing, the mind untroubled, and the will undisturbed. Visualization and inward contemplation in sitting forgetfulness are indispensable.\n\nYet how many ignorant beginners, unaware of the proper time for union or the methods of practice, cling to visualization in hopes of swift success, imagining the elixir forming within, \"gathering medicine\" in their thoughts, pounding the nose and swallowing with the mouth. They fixate on the tangible sun and moon, the formless heaven and earth, attempting to retain them in the abdomen—this is mere child’s play. Thus, the accomplished and extraordinary dismiss such practices, saying: \"Gaining wealth in a dream—how can it be of use? Drawing a cake on the ground—can it satisfy hunger?\" Empty within empty, like flowers in a mirror or the moon in water, such efforts ultimately come to nothing.\n\nYet there is merit in these methods: for those whose minds are easily stirred and whose single intent is hard to subdue, on a favorable day and at an auspicious hour, they may be adopted and applied. Though one may know of a place of purity, if the mind is enslaved by affairs and the will swayed by emotions, if time passes like lightning and every moment is precious, the slightest error may separate one from heaven and earth as far as the poles. Years and months may pass without progress—such failure stems from a scattered mind and a wild will.\n\nThe skilled painter, intent on the beauty of colors and ink, does not see Mount Tai; the skilled musician, intent on the sound of strings and bamboo, does not hear thunder. The functions of the ears and eyes are limited, yet even they can be so focused. How much more so the single mind, which roams the six directions and encompasses all things? At the moment of applying the method and seizing the time, can one refrain from using visualization and inward contemplation to achieve it?\n\nLü said: What, in broad terms, is the practice of visualization and inward work?\n\nZhong said: When yang ascends, one visualizes many things: a man, a dragon, fire, heaven, clouds, a crane, the sun, a horse, smoke, rosy clouds, a chariot, a carriage, flowers, qi—all such images are inward contemplations and visualizations corresponding to the ascent of yang.\n\nWhen yin descends, one visualizes many things: a woman, a tiger, water, earth, rain, a tortoise, the moon, an ox, a spring, mud, a boat, leaves—all such images are inward contemplations and visualizations corresponding to the descent of yin.\n\nThe Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior—since these names exist, their images must also exist. The Five Peaks and Nine Provinces, the Four Seas and Three Islands, the Golden Boy and Jade Maiden, the River Chariot and Towering Chambers—by naming and categorizing them, one cannot exhaust their descriptions. All are established as images within the void to stabilize the spirit and consciousness.\n\nBefore catching the fish, one must not discard the fish trap; before capturing the hare, one must not do away with the snare. When the rear carriage is about to move, it must follow the path of the one before it. Once the great vessel is completed, it becomes the model for those that follow. Thus, the method of inward contemplation is indispensable in practice.\n\nYet one must neither cling to it indefinitely nor abandon it in an instant—both extremes are to be avoided. If one cuts off all thoughts and enters a state of no-thought, this is true thought; true thought is true emptiness. In the realm of true emptiness, one gradually ascends toward the transcendent, leaving the dark paths of delusion and achieving liberation.\n\nAt the beginning of one’s practice, with daily progress, visualization may be employed. Moreover, as one diminishes daily in the pursuit of the Dao, entering the realm of the Inaudible and Invisible, the method naturally refines and recedes—all depends on inward contemplation.",

Then, with the lungs’ absence of yin, Metal and Fire share a furnace. Next, with the spleen’s absence of yin, the Jade Gate does not open. Finally, the true qi ascends, and the four qi gather into one. Even if the Golden Fluid descends, a cup of water cannot overcome the fire of a cartload of kindling.

      "translated_text": "Lü said: \"If one speaks of the union of dragon and tiger to pair yin and yang, what should the visualization resemble?\"\nZhong replied: \"At first, in coupling to harmonize yin and yang and stabilize Kan and Li, the visualization should be thus: the Nine August True Men lead a small boy in crimson robes upward, while the Nine August True Mothers guide a small girl in black robes downward. They meet before the Yellow Chamber. A yellow-robed old woman receives them, performing the rites of mortal marriage. When the union is complete, they rejoice; then the girl descends, the boy ascends, as if parting in the human world. Once finished, the old woman cradles an object shaped like a vermilion orange and casts it into the Yellow Chamber, where it is held in a golden vessel. This boy is Qian seeking Kun, his yang returning to its original place, yang bearing yin to reunite with its homeland. This girl is Kun seeking Qian, her yin returning to its original place, yin embracing yang to reunite with its homeland. This is what is meant by Kan and Li uniting to pair yin and yang.\n\nAlternatively, within raging flames, one may see a black tiger ascending, while in surging waves, a red dragon descends. The two beasts meet and battle before a towering pavilion. Crimson gates swing open, and amid billowing smoke and fire, a king gestures toward the sky-engulfing blaze, above which towering waves rise. Fire surges and recedes, smoke and flames filling heaven and earth. Dragon and tiger coil and retreat, entering a golden vessel, which then descends into the Yellow Chamber, as if placed within a gilded cabinet. Such is the visualization of the dragon and tiger’s union transforming into the yellow sprout.\n\nLü said: \"The pairing of yin and yang through the union of dragon and tiger—now that I understand the inward contemplation and visualization—what of the method of advancing the fire to refine the elixir? What should the visualization be?\"\nZhong replied: \"The visualization is thus: a vessel like a tripod or cauldron, either yellow or black, shaped like a wheel. To its left is the Azure Dragon, to its right the White Tiger; before it the Vermilion Bird, behind it the Dark Warrior. Flanking it stand two ministers in purple robes, bowing and holding jade tablets. Attendants and officials feed firewood to the vessel. Then a king in crimson robes, riding a red horse and driving fiery clouds, descends from the sky. He brandishes his whip, shouting, fearful the flames are too small. Fire blazes fiercely, filling the void, striking the heavens but unable to break through. The smoke and flames descend again, swirling on all sides. The vessel, the people, the king, and his ministers—all are enveloped in crimson flames, gesturing and calling to one another, vying to advance the fire. The water within the vessel, though without vapor, seems congealed; the pearl within the water, though without darkness, shines with radiance. Such is the visualization of advancing the fire to refine the elixir.\n\nLü said: \"Inward contemplation and visualization—do they cease with the gathering of medicine and advancing of fire, or do they persist through subsequent methods and practices?\"\nZhong replied: \"Thunder rumbles as lightning descends, smoke and flames rise. Heaven rains rare blossoms, auspicious winds and propitious vapors arise in the palace courtyard. Jade maidens and immortal maidens ride colorful phoenixes and auspicious simurghs down from the azure heavens, bearing golden trays of jade dew and rosy nectar to offer the king. Such is the visualization of the golden liquid returning elixir, the state of perfect completion.\n\nAlternatively, dragon and tiger pull a chariot through fire, surging upward through the Three Passes. At each pass stand countless armed guards, fearful of intruders. First, dragon and tiger charge but fail to open them; only when great fire burns them do the gates swing wide. The ascent continues without pause until reaching the Heavenly Pool. Or three cranes pierce the three heavens; or twin butterflies enter the three palaces; or within five-colored clouds, a small boy in crimson robes is borne past the Gate of Heaven; or a golden chariot with jade linchpins carries a king beyond the Three Realms. Such is the visualization of the flying golden essence behind the elbow, the Great River Chariot.\n\nThen a crimson-robed messenger rides a chariot, traveling in sequence: from Ji Province to Yan and Qing Provinces, from Qing to Xu Province, from Xu to Yang Province, from Yang to Jing Province, from Jing to Liang Province, from Liang to Yong Province, and from Yong back to Ji Province—east, west, south, and north, completing the circuit in Yu Province before resuming the journey. What is gathered are gold and jade; what is accomplished is the congealing of stagnation. A single official transmits the decree, and the Nine Provinces are harmonized. The cycle repeats endlessly, ceaselessly circulating. Or one may wander the Five Peaks, beginning at Mount Heng; or sail the Five Lakes, starting at the Northern Marsh; or receive celestial decrees summoning the Five Emperors; or issue royal commands to the Five Marquises. Such are the visualizations of the returning elixir.\n\nThen pearls and jade scatter upon the earth; or rain and dew nourish all things; or the sea tide fills the hundred rivers; or yang arises and stirs the myriad beings; or fire blazes across heaven and earth; or mist and haze fill the cosmos. Such are the visualizations of refining the form.\n\nThen, like a crane leaving its nest, or a dragon emerging from the celestial vault; or the Five Emperors paying court to Heaven; or five-colored clouds rising; or riding a cinnabar phoenix through the azure void; or ascending the celestial thoroughfare as if in a dream; or heavenly blossoms raining down amid celestial music, golden light swirling into palaces of splendor—such are the visualizations of audience with the Origin.\n\nAfter audience with the Origin, visualization ceases, and this is truly called inward contemplation.\n\nLü said: \"The profound principle of inward contemplation differs from earlier methods—may I hear of it?\"\nZhong replied: \"From ancient times to the present, those who cultivate the Dao yet fail to grasp the celestial mechanism begin without understanding. They follow the method in practice, seeking swift liberation.

      "translated_text": "True immortals and supreme sages, in their quest to gather the medicine, advance the fire, withdraw lead and add mercury, return the elixir and refine the form, achieve audience with the Origin and merge with the primordial, have spoken in earnest and explained in detail—ever fearful that the world might not awaken—yet have scarcely attended to the method of inward contemplation. Little do they realize that inward contemplation is the method of yin-yang transformation, the moment when immortal and mortal exchange places. Those who follow the Dao must not treat it lightly or employ it trivially.\n\nMoreover, the preceding practices—union and interaction—occur at appointed times, and their execution follows established principles. If one diligently adheres to discipline, maintains unwavering faith, and practices in accord with the proper timing without the slightest deviation, results may be seen in due course. But inward contemplation knows neither fixed hours nor set procedures. Secluded in a chamber of profound stillness, one sits upright day and night, recognizing the yang spirit and driving out the yin ghosts. Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years before transcending the inner court; the World-Honored One meditated in darkness for six years before emerging from the mortal cage. Thus, inward contemplation is truly a difficult endeavor.\n\nAt first, the process moves from above downward: the purple river chariot carries one into the celestial palace. Who would not admire the wealth and honor of the heavenly realm? One may come and go, indulging in its splendor and extravagance—experiencing all that mortals never see. Those who cultivate the Dao, having long endured simplicity and solitude, may, when their merit reaches sufficient measure, be overwhelmed by such pleasures. Towers adorned with pearls and jade, women’s music and reed pipes, rare delicacies and exotic feasts, strange herbs and wondrous birds—all unfold like a painted scroll before the eyes. Yet if one fails to awaken, mistaking the inner court for the true celestial palace, one may linger there, believing the dim thoroughfare to be the heavens. Thus, the body remains bound to the world, unable to shed its form and become a spirit immortal. Only when one has not yet reached the celestial palace does one remain in inward contemplation.\n\nYin ghosts and external demons arise from the mind, taking shape from images and manifesting as demonic armies. If the cultivator becomes reckless and strays into delusion, or loses themselves to heterodox paths, they will never attain immortality. For the three corpses and seven poisons desire only the practitioner’s death to secure their own pleasure, while the nine worms and six thieves suffer when the practitioner is at peace, finding no place to abide.\n\n**On Demonic Obstacles**\nLü said: \"Inward contemplation gathers the yang spirit; refining the spirit transcends the inner court; leaping upward exits through the celestial gate, directly ascending to the ranks of immortality. Once one has exited and entered without error, coming and going without misstep, near or far as one wishes—if one desires to remain in the world, spirit and form unite; if one seeks to ascend as an immortal, one may wander to the distant Penglai Isles. If this is so, and after fulfilling the three thousand merits one achieves liberation through inward contemplation, how then do yin ghosts and demonic forces obstruct the cultivator’s ascent to immortality?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"When a cultivator first embraces faith, worldly attachments—love, fame, profit, and all mundane toils—must not sway their great resolve. Next, they must endure hardship with diligent perseverance, remaining unmoved by all ethereal and empty states, never altering their original intent. If one’s resolve is to achieve great completion but one settles for middling success, or aims for middling completion but stops at minor attainment—how much more so for those who do not comprehend the great Dao, who fail to grasp the celestial mechanism, who practice minor arts and favor heterodox methods? Time slips by, and no progress is seen. In old age, they decline and reenter the cycle of rebirth, leading later seekers of the Dao to dismiss longevity as a delusion and liberation as empty talk. Though some may hear the teaching, they do not believe it; even if their hearts believe, they lack the resolve to endure. Confronted by circumstances, their minds waver; encountering worldly things, their aspirations falter. Thus, they never escape the nine trials and ten demonic obstacles.\"\n\nLü said: \"What are the nine trials?\"\n\nZhong replied: \"Before the great medicine is complete, one must endure cold and heat—throughout the year, clothing is needed for each season. Before true qi is born, hunger and thirst persist—throughout the day, three meals are required. For the cultivator, the pressing need for clothing and food is the first trial.\n\nFurthermore, if one’s karmic debt from past lives is heavy, it must be repaid in this existence. Even when stealing moments of leisure amid busyness, one remains bound by the constraints of elders. Daily, one cannot bear to abandon family obligations for undisturbed practice. For the cultivator, the obstruction of elders is the second trial.\n\nMoreover, those one loves—wife and children—and those one cherishes—parents—entangle one in bonds of affection and emotion, which grow daily. The household, like a cart of sorrows, never ceases its turning. Though one may harbor a heart for purity and simplicity, it is hard to withstand the onslaught of cares and vexations. For the cultivator, the entanglement of love and attachment is the third trial.\n\nFurthermore, those who possess vast wealth or hold high office cannot rest their restless minds; the greedy are ever anxious over insufficiency. For the cultivator, the snare of fame and profit is the fourth trial.\n\nMoreover, if in youth one refuses to cultivate restraint, weakness of qi may lead to illness, or a stubborn heart may prevent awakening. Karmic retribution may bring disaster, and one may suffer in this very life, serving as a warning to others. For the cultivator, the sudden onset of calamity is the fifth trial.\n\nFurthermore, when one recognizes that the matter of life and death is paramount and urgently seeks a teacher, one may fail to discern the true from the false—following one with eloquent speech or another with an austere demeanor. At first, one may believe they have encountered an immortal, only to later realize they have fallen in with a profiteer. For the cultivator, the constraint of a blind teacher is the sixth trial.\n\nMoreover, blind teachers and reckless companions may point to side doors, plucking branches and leaves without ever grasping the root. Minor arts and heterodox methods are passed among them, each claiming secret knowledge. Yet they do not understand that the sun and moon do not shine until they emerge—then their brilliance is seen by all. Thunder does not roar until it strikes—then its might is heard by all. But these, with their flickering firelight and the croaking of well-frogs, their dim murmurs and chatter—how could they ever align with the true Dao?\"",

      "translated_text": "The cultivator of the Dao must also guard against the seventh trial: the confusion of divergent doctrines. There are those who alter their path from morning to night, who forget their seated practice upon standing, who delight in fleeting moments yet grow weary of perseverance, who begin with diligence but end in slackness. This is the eighth trial: the wavering of will and the slackening of intent.\n\nThen there are those who lose the year within the span of a season, the month within the span of a day, the hour within the span of a moment—while the young remain entangled in thoughts of fame and profit, and the old linger over concerns for children and grandchildren. Time is finite: do not say, \"This year has passed, I shall wait for the next,\" nor, \"Today is done, I shall wait for tomorrow.\" Today does not guarantee tomorrow, and old age can never reclaim youth. This is the ninth trial: the squandering of years and months.\n\nOnly by overcoming these nine trials may one truly walk the Dao. If even one or two remain unmastered, all effort will be in vain, and success will never be attained.\n\nLü said: \"Now that the nine trials are known, may I hear of the ten demons?\"\nZhong said: \"The ten demons fall into three categories: first, those manifest in the external world; second, those arising in dreams; and third, those encountered in inner contemplation.\n\nWhen the eyes are dazzled by blossoms, the ears filled with music, the tongue savoring sweetness, the nose drawn to rare fragrances, the heart swayed by ease, and the spirit soaring—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of the six thieves.\n\nWhen one beholds jade towers and jeweled pavilions, painted beams and carved rafters, pearl curtains and embroidered drapes, orchid chambers and coral-strewn floors, halls overflowing with gold and jade—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of wealth.\n\nWhen one sees golden saddles and priceless steeds, stately canopies, enfeoffment of ten thousand households, imperial banners and insignia, gates lined with officials in purple, and forests of fine boots—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of nobility.\n\nWhen one witnesses drifting mists and balmy days, violent storms and crashing thunder, radiant music and mournful wails—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of the six emotions.\n\nWhen one encounters the suffering of kin, the misfortune of family, the illness of children, the death of parents, the separation of siblings, the estrangement of wives and concubines—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of love and attachment.\n\nWhen one faces peril in fire or heights, harm from venomous creatures, poisoning, encounters with brigands, execution for crimes, or the torment of poverty—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of hardship.\n\nWhen one beholds the ten stages of enlightenment, the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Four Spirits and Seven Luminaries, the Five Peaks and Eight Kings, their majestic processions and celestial flights—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of sages and worthies.\n\nWhen one sees armies massed with gleaming blades, spears and bows at the ready, warriors clashing in deadly combat—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of warfare.\n\nWhen one is surrounded by fairy maidens in rows, their music resounding, their rainbow skirts swaying, their crimson sleeves offering golden cups—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of sensual pleasure.\n\nWhen one is tempted by beauties in alluring attire, their jade forms lightly clad, their flirtatious manners vying for affection—if one fails to recognize these as illusions, they are the demons of lust.\n\nThese are the ten demons. Failure to recognize them is the danger; recognition leads to attachment, and attachment to fixation. This is why so many fail to attain the Dao.\n\nFor the cultivator who does not cling to external illusions, the heart remains steadfast and the will unshaken. In dreams, if one neither recognizes nor attaches to visions, the spirit remains clear and the soul undispersed. In inner contemplation, when such apparitions arise, one must discern their emptiness and test their truth. One may ride the waves of illusion, but if they mistake the thief for their child, they must swiftly ignite the true fire of samadhi to burn away the self. With a single stroke, the demons scatter, and the purple river chariot carries their yang spirit beyond the inner court, returning to the celestial palace—only then may they seek liberation.\n\nNow and in ages past, those who love the Dao often begin with pure resolve, yet when confronted with circumstances, their will falters. They may escape the dust of the world, dwell in seclusion far from the mundane, and dedicate themselves to the mysteries of the Dao, yet if they fail to overcome all nine trials or succumb to even one or two of the ten demons, they may not attain the full Dao—but they may achieve partial or minor realization, ascending as human or earthly immortals.\n\nOnly by fully dispelling the demons and trials, progressing through the stages of verification step by step, and uniting the inner vision with the yang spirit, can one ascend to the Three Isles in due time.\"\n\n**On Verification**\nLü said: \"The averse fear illness, yet those who love the Dao seek freedom from illness and lasting peace. The fearful dread death, yet those who love the Dao desire immortality and eternal life. While the world remains bound to the earthly realm, those who love the Dao aspire to ascend as immortals and wander beyond the material. While the world toils on the ground, those who love the Dao strive to transcend the mortal and enter the grotto-heavens. Thus, they endure hardship and embrace poverty, their hearts roaming in purity and ease, dwelling in seclusion amid wilderness and desolation. They persist in their practice, unaware of the depth of their merit, the shifts in their method, or the timing of their transformation. After such effort, what is the sequence of verification?\"\n\nZhong said: \"Those who endure hardship yet see no progress do not suffer because the Dao has failed them, but because they did not follow an enlightened teacher and received no true method. Those who practice the method yet see no progress do not suffer because the Dao has failed them, but because they did not grasp the proper timing and thus failed to succeed.\n\nBut if one has met an enlightened teacher, received the true method, and practices the great method in accord with the proper time—how could verification not follow?\"",

But these, with their flickering firelight and the croaking of well-frogs, their dim murmurs and chatter—how could they ever align with the true Dao?\"",

      "translated_text": "Lü said: \"Does the method have a fixed number? Does the proper time have a fixed measure?\"\n\nZhong said: \"The method comprises twelve divisions: the first is the matching of yin and yang; the second, the gathering and scattering of water and fire; the third, the union of dragon and tiger; the fourth, the firing and refining of the elixir; the fifth, the flying of golden essence behind the elbow; the sixth, the return of jade liquid as elixir; the seventh, the refining of form with jade liquid; the eighth, the return of golden liquid as elixir; the ninth, the refining of form with golden liquid; the tenth, the refining of the black through audience with the origin; the eleventh, the inner observation of transformation; the twelfth, the liberation and division of form.\n\nAs for the proper time, it follows the yearly ascent and descent of heaven and earth’s yin and yang, the monthly cycles of the sun and moon’s movements, and the daily divisions of the four cardinal directions, eight trigrams, ten celestial stems, twelve earthly branches, one hundred marks, and sixty minutes. When the method is practiced in accord with these divisions, from the first day onward, the sequence of verification proceeds without the slightest deviation until the transcendence of the mortal frame and ascension as an immortal.\n\nAt first, lewd and deviant thoughts cease entirely, and external practices are cultivated alongside the gathering of medicine. Next, golden essence fills the heart’s realm, naturally dispelling the yin marsh’s loach as it surges upward through the heart meridian, and sweet liquid appears in the mouth. Then, yin and yang strike and clash, and the sound of wind and thunder is heard within the abdomen. Next, the hun and po become unsettled, and dreams are filled with fearful and startling visions. Then, the six bowels and four limbs may develop minor ailments, which heal without treatment. Next, the cinnabar field grows warm at night, and the countenance appears clear and refined by day. Then, in darkness, the eyes emit a divine radiance. Next, in dreams, one becomes bold and fearless, untouchable by harm or deceit, or one may dream of holding a returned infant. Then, the golden barrier and jade lock seal firmly, preventing nocturnal emissions and leakage. Next, a thunderous roar sounds, the joints open and connect, and startled sweat flows in all directions. Then, jade liquid is simmered and rinsed, congealing into butter. Next, the numinous liquid thickens into a paste, and one gradually develops an aversion to rank and foul odors, filling the mouth and stomach. Then, the mortal bones grow light and transform into a divine chamber; one’s steps outpace a galloping horse, and movement becomes as swift as flight. Next, when facing external phenomena, the mind remains detached, and cravings and desires cease. Then, true qi enters objects and can cure others’ illnesses. Next, inner observation becomes clear and unobscured. Then, the pupils of the eyes become as dark as lacquer, wrinkled skin smooths and rejuvenates, and gray hair regrows; those who were aged retain a youthful appearance. Next, true qi gradually becomes abundant, and one feels perpetually sated, eating little yet drinking wine without limit and never becoming drunk. Then, the body grows lustrous, the spirit radiant and refined; the sacred elixir produces flavor, the numinous liquid emits fragrance, and true fragrance and rare tastes linger between mouth and nose, perceptible to others. Next, one’s gaze can discern the finest details at a hundred paces. Then, old scars and blemishes on the body naturally fade, and tears, saliva, and sweat no longer appear. Next, the fetus is complete and qi is full, eliminating the need for food and drink. Then, the inner will becomes lofty and aligns with the Great Void; worldly emotions and attachments vanish from the heart, the nine worms are eradicated below, and the three corpses die above. Next, the hun and po no longer wander, and dreams cease; the spirit’s clarity remains constant, day and night. Then, yang essence forms the body, the divine palace becomes firm, and the four limbs are unaffected by cold or heat. Next, life and death can no longer interfere; in seated forgetfulness and inner observation, one roams the divine immortal realm of Huaxu, where towers of female musicians, pavilions, and resplendent beauty surpass anything in the mortal world. Then, when merit is complete and conduct is fulfilled, karmic retribution manifests; the Three Clarities secretly bestow the true record, and one can foresee the transformations of yin and yang, predict human affairs, and perceive disasters and blessings in advance. Next, the dust and clutter of the world become wearisome; one purifies the body and dwells in stillness, and the fetal immortal appears—an external body emerges alongside the original, marking one as a divine sage. Then, true qi becomes purely yang, and exhalations can dry external mercury. Next, the fetal immortal constantly desires to ascend, and auspicious light arises in the bedchamber. Then, in stillness, one often hears celestial music. Next, when facing ordinary people—even the wealthy and noble—one detects the stench of their mortal bones and vulgar bodies. Then, the spirit’s radiance can transform at will; one’s bearing becomes refined, and one’s immortal countenance rivals a jade tree, while a golden hue shines through the extraordinary bones. Next, wherever one goes, divine spirits naturally appear to pay homage, obeying commands as if by one’s own will. Then, in stillness, one gazes outward to see purple clouds filling the eyes; looking downward from the crown, a golden light envelops the body. Next, within the body, a fire dragon suddenly takes flight, or a dark crane ascends—this is the spirit’s liberation from mortal bones, transcending the vulgar world, called *liberation*. Then, after liberation, colorful clouds swirl, auspicious vapors abound, heaven rains rare flowers, dark cranes fly in pairs, and extraordinary fragrance scatters as jade maidens descend to bestow celestial scriptures and purple decrees. Once complete, the attire of an immortal—crown, robes, and all—is fully prepared, along with the regalia and dignity of command, too numerous to recount. Escorted and guided, one returns to Penglai, where in the Purple Palace one pays audience to the Supreme Subtle True Lord. After verifying one’s original name and assessing the degree of merit, one resides on the three islands as a *zhenren* or immortal being.\"\n\nLü said: \"Today, I have been specially favored by your honor’s exposition of the profound principles of the abstruse and the celestial mysteries of heaven and earth. Not only have my ears and eyes become clear, and my spirit radiant and refined, but this decaying body now has a refuge—it will no longer share the fate of dust and dirt. Yet those who know may not necessarily practice, and those who practice may not necessarily succeed. Considering the gravity of life and death and the swift passage of time, even if one knows the wondrous principles, failure to practice renders it no different from ignorance.
