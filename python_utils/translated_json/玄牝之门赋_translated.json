One chapter. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\nThis is the Gate of the Mysterious Above and the Female Below—\nA single aperture, the Mysterious Female, the root of the Great Elixir.\nIt is the Valley of the Void and Origin, the mutual gate of ingress and egress.\nThe cauldron and vessel are set in noble and base, distinctly opposed;\nThe mechanism of the primordial merges in opening and closing, subtly beyond words.\n\nNow, the immortals establish the foundation of cultivation:\nThe primordial qi perpetually circulates above and below,\nThe lead furnace and mercury tripod are built upon this.\nThe Jade Palace and Golden Gate—few recognize them.\nVast is the Mysterious Female, beyond naming;\nIt harmonizes yin and yang, thus it is called the Gate.\n\nWithin the furnace and tripod, mercury and lead are concealed,\nTo the east, it connects with the Valley of Fusang;\nTo the west, it reaches the summit of Mount Hua.\nGrasping the essence of the Two Earths, they wondrously unite;\nAt the boundary of the Two Phases, they evenly divide.\nVast without exterior, minute without interior—\nBelow, it is called the Female; above, the Mysterious.\n\nThe Cinnabar Tripod, the Moon-Reclining Furnace—\nA single mechanism secretly operates the Gate of Returning to Life.\nThe Cavity of Returning to the Root encompasses all wonders—\nAll is this Gate.\n\nYang opens, yin closes; opening and closing are endless.\nThe sun departs, the moon arrives; going and coming never cease.\nAbove is the Celestial Gate, receiving Qian and Jia;\nBelow is the Earthly Portal, concealing Kun and Gui.\nBoundless and without sides, it is not of form;\nA single enclosure and opening—this is the Gate.\n\nHigh and low in harmony—great indeed, perfect indeed!\nComing and going, circling and roaming—\nExiting here, entering here.\n\nPray, what is this aperture? All possess it,\nYet calling it not a gate, it is called the Gate—few in the world know.\nFor heaven and earth constantly unite in the ceaseless ebb and flow,\nAnd spirit and qi ever merge in unbroken continuity.\nNow, this aperture pierces the chaos of primordial darkness,\nForging the foundation of the True One.\n\nBy the reckoning of the celestial stems, the Female Below resides in *zi*;\nBy the arrangement of the Eight Trigrams, the Mysterious Above belongs to the Gate of *Li*.\nSuch is their division.\nYet the aperture is a unified whole—\nThus, Master Zi Yang exhaustively expounded its rarely known discourse,\nElse how would the Old Master have spoken of their shared origin?\n\nIt has been said:\nThe obscure Female Portal lies deep within the azure sea;\nThe towering Mysterious Gate stands far upon the Kunlun peaks.\nOne yin, one yang—black and white are discernible;\nNeither form nor void—cinnabar and ink cannot depict it.\nThe Four Cardinal Directions are arrayed here,\nSpreading the *gou* and *ban* between *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*;\nThe Two Luminaries operate here,\nDriving the convergence at the dark of the moon, the crescent, and the full.\n\nSubtle! Wondrous!\nThe two characters \"Mysterious Female\"—gathered and refined,\nA moment’s effort yields:\nBelow, the White Tiger is concealed as the pivot of kindling fire;\nAbove, the Azure Dragon stirs the winds and waves of ascent.\n\nAlas! Lesser methods of side gates delude the multitude;\nThose who specialize in a single school claim superiority,\nYet if they fail to elucidate the principles of the Learning,\nHow can they align with the immortal texts?\n\nTo name the heart and kidneys as the Mysterious Female is to waste effort in visualization;\nTo regard the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female is to labor in vain at swallowing and exhaling.\nIf one abandons the heterodox and returns to the orthodox,\nGrasping the true path of the byway,\nThen entering the subtle and attaining the wondrous—\nHow could it lie beyond the gate?\n\nWhy not ponder:\nThe single aperture of spirit—where is the root of gathering and storing?\nThe inner circulation of primordial harmony—what is the origin of their union?\n\nMoreover, consider:\nThe White Tiger and Azure Dragon—why speak of a Black Tiger and Red Dragon?\nThe Mysterious Above and Female Below—what is meant by Left Mysterious and Right Female?\n\nOne should know:\nWood and fire take the lead—wood is stored within fire;\nMetal and water share a palace—metal lies hidden within water.\nThis is what is called \"mysterious beyond mystery, wondrous beyond wonder.\"\nIts transformations and discourses are endless.\n\n**Poem: Gold in Water**\nA speck of bright golden grain,\nIts source lies within the water.\nNine returns form the great medicine,\nA moment reveals divine power.\nThe Primordial Sea stirs with yang harmony,\nThe cold spring’s qi and pulse flow.\nIn an instant, it becomes a white liquid,\nCongealing to fill the Yellow Palace.\nNurtured by the Earth of Kun,\nFanned by the Wind of Xun.\nWhen shall I cherish this treasure,\nAnd seek the Venerable Immortal Lü?\n\nThe *Alternative Transmission Beyond the Yi* in one fascicle presents diagrams and explanations, elucidating the utmost mystery at the center of the *Precelestial Diagram*. It corroborates this with the *Triple Concordance Canon*, the *Yellow Emperor’s Hidden Talisman Classic*, and other texts, while integrating the profound discourses of scholars such as Master Yi Chuan and Master Heng Qu. Thus, it reveals what Master Zhu never expounded, further expanding the unspoken intent beyond Master Shao’s words. Though I have not devoted myself exclusively to this pursuit, the wondrous workings of the elixir are not merely understood in passing—I have indeed tested them. Therefore, I dare to directly point out what alchemists have obscured, dispelling the confusions of seekers.\n\nI have often lamented that the transmitted texts of the elixir schools are filled with abstruse phrases and veiled language, leaving readers with no crevice to enter. Dazzled and bewildered, they often close the scrolls with long sighs. Even scholars like Cai Jitong and Yuan Jizhong, who collaborated with Master Zhu to emend the *Triple Concordance Canon*, could only examine its literal meanings; lacking its true transmission, they were reduced to mere conjecture. Now that I have received this teaching, how could I bear to keep it sealed in silence for my own sake? Thus, I append this work to the *Collected Explanations of the Zhouyi* and title it *Alternative Transmission Beyond the Yi*. For though the doctrines of the elixir schools emerge from the *Yi*, they merely borrow and rely upon it—they are not the *Yi*’s original meaning.\n\nThe great principles and essentials of the elixir path are thoroughly expounded in this book. As for its subtle and intricate details, they are fully recorded in the three fascicles of *Elucidations on the Triple Concordance Canon*; I shall not repeat them here.\n\nInscribed by Yu Meiyuwu, the Recluse of Stone Stream in the Grotto Heaven of Forest Chamber.\n\n---\n\nThe *Alternative Transmission Beyond the Yi* in one fascicle was composed by my late father and appended to his *Collected Explanations of the Zhouyi*. My father once encountered a recluse who revealed to him the *Precelestial Diagram*, pointing out the utmost mystery at the center of Master Shao’s work. Thus, this book primarily elucidates Master Shao’s teachings.\n\nRecently, the *Exegesis of the Hidden Talisman Classic* was printed. My son, Zhen, requested that this leaf be transcribed and carved alongside it, together with the *Exegesis of the Qin Garden Spring* in three works bound as one, to be shared with worthy scholars everywhere. Hence, we collectively title them *The Orthodox Tradition of Mystical Learning*.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by your son, Zhongwen, with a hundred bows, in the first month of spring in the bing-shen year of the Zhizheng era.\n\nThe *Rhapsody on the Gate of the Mysterious Female* is now complete.",
