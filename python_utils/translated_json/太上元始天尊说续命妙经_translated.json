Pseudepigraphically attributed to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, who expounds it to the Most High Dao Lord, exhorting people to recite the scripture to dispel calamities and prolong life.

How can you bear this? You must diligently uphold and practice my Dharma, universally saving and delivering them.\"\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord, having received the command, dared not conceal his true intent. If there are sentient beings in peril or afflicted by illness, they should recite this scripture and invoke the Great Compassionate, Great Merciful, Great Benevolent Perfected One, and the Great Compassionate, Great Merciful Perfected One Who Saves from Suffering. Thereby, they shall escape suffering, attain lasting liberation, forever break free from karmic entanglements, prolong life, renew their aged years, and all calamities and hardships shall be extinguished.\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord proclaimed a hymn, saying:\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones of Great Compassion,\nCan save the suffering of the Three Realms.\nRadiating light to illuminate the world,\nHell’s torments all cease.\n\nKnife-mountains rise towering,\nCauldron-waters boil fiercely.\nWith sincere mind, invoke the Perfected Ones,\nSinful souls resolve past grievances.\n\nIllness and hardship bring many woes,\nBeyond words of disaster and distress.\nAlas! The Five Spirits are harmed,\nThe Perfected Ones pity their bitter pain.\n\nDevout faithful men and women,\nMust wholeheartedly surrender.\nConstantly invoke the Two Perfected Ones,\nTo escape suffering and avoid sinking sorrow.\n\nIllness and calamities dispelled,\nEvil demons dare not encroach.\nDay and night, the mind unwavering,\nLiberation secures your entire being.\n\nWith courage, dedicate the merit,\nTogether return to the Forest of Seven Treasures.\n\n**Thus concludes the *Marvelous Scripture of Life-Prolonging Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy*.**",
