of *The Complete Canon of Daoist Doctrines and Rituals*** – *The Ritual of the Original Command of Life by Master Guangting Du*\n\n**Morning Dao Ritual: The Original Command of Life**\nThe ritual proceedings commence as the altar is ascended in proper form.\nThe assembled lectors recite the scriptures, each paying homage to their respective teachers in accordance with the Dao.\nThe High Master (高功) proclaims the protective incantations of the Dao.\n\nThe Azure Yang (青阳) radiates its luminous reflection,\nIlluminating the sun and returning the spirit.\nThe Divine Tiger repels malevolence,\nThe flying celestial beings scatter their bells.\nIt crushes deceit and extinguishes falsehoods,\nBinding all demons in their forms.\nThe Nine Mysteries (九微) return to the Dao,\nThe Eight Auras (八威) subdue the vital essence (精).\nThe Thousand Authentic Ones (千真) verify the records,\nThe Three Primordials (三元) purify the heavens.\n\nTo the left, the Yellow Whistle (啸中黄) invokes,\nTo the right, the Six Ding (六丁) are summoned.\nSeven rotations, eight harmonies,\nCirculating the Heavenly Scriptures (天经).\n\nThe sacred Dao resounds majestically,\nThe Great Dao/Way (大道) is set in motion.\nAuspicious clouds flow forth,\nConverging the radiance of the Yellow Court (黄庭),\nIn harmony with the Dao/Way’s true essence.\n\nThe assembled lectors recite again,\nStriking the ritual drum (法鼓) twenty-four times.\n\nThe High Master lights the incense burner (发炉).\nWe invoke the Supreme Three Heavens (三天), the Primordial Origin of the Three Qi (三炁), the Most High Dao Lord (太上道君), and the Most High Old Lord (太上老君), calling forth from within our bodies the thirty-five officials of the Three Five (三五), the left and right envoys, the left and right incense bearers, the courier dragons and mounted officers, the attendants of golden boys and silver girls who scatter words and flowers, and the thirty-six direct symbols of the Five Emperors (五帝), the thirty-six direct-day incense officials (直日香官), and all others who have emerged.\n\nThose who have emerged are clad in solemn and resplendent attire,\nTheir headgear and sashes adorned with trailing plumes,\nOpening the Mystic Altar (玄坛) and summoning the local deities and spirits of the domain (方域神真).\n\nWe now present our morning court,\nAscend the altar to perform the Dao Ritual,\nAnd humbly recite our intentions—\nOur sincere aspirations are recorded in the heavens,\nAnd we pray that the Most High Ten-Directions True Dao (十方至真道) and the Primordial Qi (一炁) of the Dao,\nThe luminous treasure of the Venerable Dao (灵宝瑞光),\nMay descend and flow into our bodies,\nSo that our efforts may swiftly reach the Most High Dao of the Supreme Extremity (太上无极大道),\nThe Three Pure Ones (三清) and the Uppermost Saints (上圣),\nThe Heavenly Sovereign of Jade (昊天玉皇上帝),\nThe Grand Sovereign of the Purple Cluster (紫微北极大帝),\nThe Celestial Lord of the Central Dipper (斗中之尊),\nThe Great Sovereign of the Dipper (天皇大帝),\nThe Great Lord of the Dipper (斗中之主),\nThe Purple Cluster Great Sovereign (紫微大帝),\nThe Northern Dipper High Sovereign (北斗高上玉皇尊帝君),\nThe Celestial Lord of the Great Constellation (太微玉帝),\nThe Northern Dipper High Marshal (北斗太尉) of the Yang Brightness and the Greedy Star (阳明贪狼玉晨君),\nThe Northern Dipper Supreme Steward (上宰) of the Yin Essence and the Giant Gate Star (阴精巨门玉晨君),\nThe Northern Dipper Grand Administrator (司空) of the True Person and the Storehouse Star (禄存玉晨君),\nThe Northern Dipper Wandering Attendant (游擎) of the Mystic Darkness and the Literary Music Star (文曲玉晨君),\nThe Northern Dipper Lord of the Dipper (斗君) of the Red Primordial and the Chaste Star (丹元廉贞玉晨君),\nThe Northern Dipper High Officer (太常) of the Northern Extremity and the Military Music Star (武曲玉晨君),\nThe Northern Dipper Heavenly Sovereign (上帝) of the Celestial Gate and the Star of the Broken Army (天关破军玉晨君),\nThe Northern Dipper Celestial Lord (玉帝) of the Mystic Clarity and the Outer Auxiliary Star (洞明外辅玉晨君),\nThe Northern Dipper True Sovereign (帝真) of the Hidden Primordial and the Inner Auxiliary Star (隐元内弼玉晨君),\nThe Dipper’s Celestial Enforcer (天罡) of the Ten-Thousand Authentic and the Commander of the Deluge Star (奎光帝君),\nThe Nine Sovereigns of the Northern Dipper (北斗九皇夫人),\nThe Nine Yin Inner Consorts (九阴内妃),\nThe Three Platforms and the Five Constellations (三台华盖星君),\nThe Three Officials and Five Emperors (三官五帝),\nThe Nine Departments and Four Divisions (九府四司),\nThe Daoist Virtues of the Dipper (斗中道德诸君),\nThe Saintly Host of the Unbridled (无鞅圣众),\nThe Sixty Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches of the Original Command Stars (六十甲子本命星君),\nThe Great Daoist Master of the Mystic (玄中大法师),\nThe Great Daoist Masters of the Three Heavens (三天大法师),\nThe True Persons of the Precious (宝上真人),\nThe Two Immortal Envoys (二仙使者),\nThe Nine Palace Officials and Attendants (九宫官属),\nAnd all true spirits (一切真灵).\n\nWe have heard that the Great Dao/Way, once divided,\nThe Primordial Essence (元精) began its operation,\nThe heavens and earth hung their symbols,\nAnd yin and yang nurtured the spirit.\n\nAt its inception, humanity was born,\nFirst emerging among all living beings,\nThe divine essence coalesced in the Supreme Extremity (太极),\nThe vital qi condensed in the Heavy Darkness (重玄).\nAll owe their nurturing to the sacred Dao,\nAnd share in the transformation of the natural world.\n\nWe, by fortune, have been granted this life,\nAnd now partake in the human order.\nAs the Three Mystic Caverns (三洞) open their light\nAnd the Five Sacred Scriptures (五文) unfold their profundity,\nWe have glimpsed the Mystic Darkness (玄微) through the jade cases and phoenix tablets,\nAnd explored the hidden depths with the phoenix scrolls and dragon chapters.\n\nYet, though we abide in the world and follow its customs,\nAs time passes, we have not yet ascended to absorb the clouds and stars of the ten directions,\nNor grasped the divine mists of the celestial valleys.\n\nOnly by performing our duties to assist the Original Command (功佐命),\nExpanding the Dao and transforming the age (弘道化时),\nMay we fulfill the Mystic Teachings (玄科),\nAnd hope to manifest the subtle effects (微效).\nMoreover, we now present this petition in accordance with the sacred edict—\nHow dare we not humbly report it?\n\n**Proclamation of the Petition**\nAs the words of the petition are spoken,\nWith sincere and earnest devotion.\n\nToday, on the day of my birth and the Original Command of my life,\nI devoutly surrender to the Dao,\nAnd solemnly establish this Daoist hall,\nTo pray for blessings from the Nine Heavens (九天),\nAnd to extend longevity to this very day.\nWith reverence, I light the incense and focus my thoughts on the true spirits (真灵).\n\nI follow the ten-directional rites of the Azure Court (十华朝会之仪),\nAnd the three-realm incense-burning format (三境焚香之格).\n\nI pray that the Primordial Sovereign (元尊) may descend to inspect,\nAnd that the Ten-Thousand Saints (万圣) may shine their light,\nCommanding the Five Emperors (五帝) to gather at the Jade Palace (玉宫),\nAnd summoning all true spirits (群真) to the Eight Extremes (八极).\n\nI open the Red Primordial rank (丹秩) of the Southern Celestial Chant,\nAnd increase blessings and longevity;\nI inscribe the Azure script (青文) of the Eastern Dipper,\nAnd flow its auspiciousness to bestow fortune upon all.\n\nNow, in this morning Dao Ritual,\nI request the ritual assembly (法众) to take this first pinch of incense and ascend.\n\nAll join in offering the incense,\nReaching the Jade Purity Palace (玉清宫),\nAnd pervading the sacred realm of the Jade Purity (玉清圣境),\nForming the Azure Pavilion (华盖),\nTo venerate the Great Primordial Lord of the Dao (大罗元始尊).\n\nI pray that this incense smoke,\nAscending directly to the heavens,\nMay venerate the Supreme True Daoist Treasure (无上至真道宝).\n\nWe, the disciples,\nSurrender our bodies, our spirits, our lives,\nAnd first prostrate ourselves to the ground.\n\nWe rely upon the Most High Three Sovereigns (太上三尊),\nThe Ten-Directions Saints (十方众圣),\nAnd pray that with this pinch of incense’s merit,\nThe blessings may extend to the spirits of the ancestral temple and the state (社稷尊灵),\nThe sacred ancestors of the peach (宗桃先圣),\nOur spirits may coalesce in the heavens above,\nAnd the blessings descend to the mortal realm (降福人间).\nMay the Emperor’s longevity mountain endure forever,\nThe Dipper’s Extremity (辰极) align with the Azure Court (齐华),\nAnd the sun and moon hang suspended to illuminate the ten directions,\nThe Primordial Harmony (元和) flow to bring peace to the four seas.\n\nMay the Empress and the Crown Prince,\nReceive eternal blessings of radiant light;\nMay the civil and military officials,\nSpread the imperial designs across the vast ages.\n\nNow, this incense-burning,\nIs an act of surrender to the Dao’s Sovereign (道尊) and the Great Saints of the True Dao (大圣众至真之德).\n\nAfter attaining the Dao,\nWe may preserve the eternal heavens,\nAnd harmonize with the Dao’s true essence.\n\nNow, in this morning court,\nAscending the altar to perform the Dao Ritual,\nWe request the ritual assembly (法众) to take this second pinch of incense and ascend.\n\n---\n\nNow, the incense of **Universal Harmony** (眾和香),\nAscends to the **Supreme Purity Palace** (至上清宮),\nPermeating all realms of the **Supreme Purity True Dao** (遍上清真境),\nForming a **Treasure Canopy** (成寶蓋),\nTo offer **nourishment** (供養) to the **Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord** (玉晨大道君).\n\nMay this incense smoke,\nAscend directly to the heavens,\nTo offer **nourishment** to the **Supreme, Most True Scripture Treasures** (無上至真經寶).\n\nWe, the subjects, surrender our **bodies** (皈身),\n**spirits** (皈神),\nAnd **lives** (皈命),\nProstrating our heads and bodies to the earth.\n\nWe humbly rely upon the **Supreme Three Sovereigns** (太上三尊),\nAnd the **Ten Directions’ Saints** (十方眾聖),\nMay the **merits of this pinch of incense** (是捻香功德),\nFlow back to bless the **vegetarian master** (斋主某),\nWith **Eight Cassias** (八桂) of equal years,\nAnd **Five Mountains** (五山) of equal blessings.\n\nMay the **Ten Thousand Immortals** (萬仙) descend with their **auspices** (降佑),\nAnd take the **Golden Elixir** (饵金液) to **calm our spirits** (安神);\nMay the **Host of Saints** (群聖) return their **radiant light** (回光),\nAnd open the **Jade Scriptures** (開玉書) to bestow **auspicious blessings** (注祿).\n\nThe **Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors** (九玄七祖),\nAscend in glory to the **Vermilion Mound** (超景朱陵),\nAnd the **Five Clans and Six Relatives** (五族六親),\nAre inscribed upon the **Crimson Tablets** (列名丹簡).\n\nNow, this incense-burning,\nIs an act of surrender to the **Scripture Sovereign** (經尊) and the **Great Saints of the True Dao** (大聖眾至真之德).\n\nAfter attaining the Dao,\nWe may preserve the **eternal heavens** (永保長存),\nAnd harmonize with the **Dao’s true essence** (和與道合真).\n\n---\n\nWith the incense of **Universal Harmony** (眾和香),\nAscending to the **Great Purity Palace** (至太清宮),\nPermeating all **Great Purity Daoist Realms** (遍太清仙境),\nForming a **Cloud Canopy** (成雲蓋),\nTo offer **nourishment** to the **Five Spirits’ Mysterious Elder Lord** (五靈玄老君).\n\nMay this incense smoke,\nAscend directly to the heavens,\nTo offer **nourishment** to the **Supreme, Most True Master Treasures** (無上至真師寶).\n\nWe, the subjects, surrender our **bodies** (皈身),\n**spirits** (皈神),\nAnd **lives** (皈命),\nProstrating our heads and bodies to the earth.\n\nWe humbly rely upon the **Supreme Three Sovereigns** (太上三尊),\nAnd the **Ten Directions’ Saints** (十方眾聖),\nMay the **merits of this pinch of incense** (是捻香功德),\nFlow back to bless the **entirety of Heaven and Earth** (天地之內),\nAnd **universally extend** (普及) to all **living beings** (群生),\nWith **Nine Nights of Illumination** (九夜開光),\nAnd **Three Realms of Clarity** (三淵朗晏),\nTo stir the **flying and sinking** (飛沉), **moving and growing** (動植),\nAll may prosper and fulfill their **nature and destiny** (生成).\n\nNow, this incense-burning,\nIs an act of surrender to the **Master Sovereign** (師尊) and the **Great Saints of the True Dao** (大聖眾至真之德).\n\nAfter attaining the Dao,\nWe may preserve the **eternal prosperity** (永保利亨),\nAnd harmonize with the **Dao’s true essence** (和與道合真).\n\n**Repentance** (忏方),\n**Commanding demons** (命魔),\nThree **invocations** (三啟),\nThree **salutations** (三禮).\n\nAgain, we **recite the sacred ranks** (重稱法位).\nThe **officiating subjects** (具位臣某),\nWith the **assembled officials** (與臨坛官眾等),\nSolemnly and sincerely **present our invocation** (上启),\nTo the **Three Pure Ones, Highest Saints** (三清上聖),\nThe **Ten Extremes of Highest Truth** (十極高真),\nThe **Celestial Bureau of Immortals** (斗府神仙),\nThe **True Daoist Ritual Host** (醮筵真宰),\nRespectfully **entreat their boundless compassion** (恭望洪慈),\nAnd **pray for their penetrating insight** (洞垂昭鑑).\n\nWe, the subjects, have heard that the **Two Qi** (二炁) **converge in harmony** (凝和),\nAnd the **Three Refined Essences** (三靈) **manifest in substance** (表質),\nReceiving the **transformation of the Great Dao’s creation** (承大道生成之化),\nAnd the **molding power of the Great Void’s furnace** (鼓太虚陶鑄之功).\n\nTherefore, the **thousand-year cycle** (千年) is the **period of descending saints** (降聖之期),\nAnd the **five-hundred-year span** (五百) is the **number of virtuous births** (生賢之數).\nNone fail to **embrace the divine essence’s wondrous operation** (禀神妙運),\nAnd **share the splendor of stars, constellations, sun, and moon** (分星辰日月之華);\nOr to **manifest virtue and spirit** (纵德诞灵),\nAnd **form the essence of mountains, rivers, and valleys** (結岳渎山川之秀).\n\nThus, their **merits are proclaimed to benefit all things** (功宣濟物),\nAnd the **Dao flourishes in its timely manifestation** (道葉為時),\nTheir **compassion extends to all living beings** (恩被生靈),\nAnd their **blessings reach both the manifest and the hidden** (惠覃幽顯).\n\nAt this **auspicious order** (令序),\nIt is fitting to **commence the ritual platform** (宜啟坛場),\nTo **embrace the boundless blessings** (將拥洪休),\nAnd **entreat the Mysterious Saints** (仰祈玄聖),\nHoping through **sincere prayer** (冀因虔禱),\nTo **obtain their responsive grace** (俾獲感通).\n\nFollowing the **Spiritual Treasure’s Bright Methods** (按靈寶明科),\nAnd **unveiling the Dao’s Natural Secrets** (披自然秘格),\nWe **inscribe the Three Realms of the Heart** (注心三境),\nAnd **surrender to the Ten Heavens of Life** (皈命十天),\nWith the **lamps’ light like the crane’s flame** (灯分鹤焰之辉),\nAnd the **incense’s smoke like the dragon’s tendrils** (香散龙烟之穗).\n\nThe **Jade Tablets** (玉章) **fly with melodious resonance** (飛韻),\nAnd the **Pure Chimes** (清磬) **flow their sound** (流音),\nSurrounding the **vast and boundless spaces** (旁周寥廓之間),\nAnd ascending to the **limitless expanse** (上達無何之外).\n\nWhen the **Three Sovereigns’ ritual is complete** (三尊演既),\nWe may **increase years within the Jade Calendar** (增年於玉曆之中);\nAnd when the **Host of Saints’ compassion flows** (萬聖流慈),\nWe may **extend blessings upon the Jade Tablets** (延祚於瑤缄之上).\n\nWith the **Nine Elixirs attained** (九丹自得),\nAll **ten thousand blessings flourish** (萬善咸臻),\nThe **long tablets inscribed in the Imperial Heart** (長簡帝心),\nAnd the **eternal protection of Heaven’s blessings** (永绥天祿).\n\nMay the **Emperor’s Jade Diagram be firmly established** (皇帝瑶圖克固),\nAnd the **auspicious blessings of the Treasure Dao flourish distantly** (寶運遐昌),\nMay all **ten thousand nations dwell in harmony** (萬國宅心),\nAnd the **Nine Enclosures** (九圍) **conform to the Dao’s transformation** (順化),\nWith the **stars and constellations aligned in their degrees** (星辰合度),\nAnd the **sun and moon radiant in their purity** (日月貞華).\n\nFrom the **outermost seas to the central realm** (海外寰中),\nAll

perform this **first offering of incense**,\nMay this incense smoke ascend straight to the heavens,\nTo venerate the **Supreme True Dao Treasure**.\n\nYour servants, **returning body, returning spirit, returning life**,\nProstrate ourselves with heads to the ground.\n\nWe rely upon the **Supreme Three Sovereigns**,\nThe **Ten Directions’ Holy Saints**,\nMay the merit of this incense

Elixir** at the **Celestial Pass**,\nTranscended the **Mysterious Yin**,\nIn the **Three Realms** and **Ten Directions**,\nAll attain supreme blessings.\n\nThus, we now burn incense,\n**Returning in devotion** to the **Dao Sovereign’s** **True Saints**,\nAfter attaining the **Way**,\nForever safeguarding our **long abiding**,\nIn harmony with **Dao and True Essence**.\n\nIn this evening’s **Dao Assembly**,\nAscending the altar to practice the **Way**,\nWe request the **Law Assembly** to perform this **second offering of incense**,\nMay this incense smoke ascend straight to the heavens,\nTo venerate the **Supreme True Scripture Treasure**.\n\nYour servants, **returning body, returning spirit, returning life**,\nProstrate ourselves with heads to the ground.\n\nWe rely upon the **Supreme

eternally,\nHis **sacred life** extend far and long.\n\nWith the **Golden Mirror** held low to survey,\nAll under heaven shall know **Great Harmony**;\nWith the **Pearl Tassels** adorned in solemn dignity,\nThe **Eight Seas** shall be serene and clear.\n\nMorning shall have **loyal and sincere** officials,\nCommon folk shall attain **wealth and longevity**.\nThe **Empress and Consorts** shall

Torch**,\n**Jade and gold** shall vie in swift procession;\nIn the lands of **Yu Spring** and **Meng Valley**,\n**Carriages and documents** shall flow as one.\n\n---\n\nNow, the present offering of incense,\nFrom the **virtue/power** of the **Enlightened Ones**—the **Great Saints**, the **Supreme Experts**, and the **True Ones**—whom we have taken refuge in.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way**,\nWe shall forever safeguard eternal existence,\nAnd align our harmony with the **True Way**.\n\nIn this evening’s solemn assembly,\nWe ascend the platform to practice the **Dao/Way**,\nAnd invite the **Dharma Assembly** to perform these three incense offerings.\nMay this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens,\nAnd pay homage to the **Supreme True Teacher Treasure**.\n\nWe, the subjects, take refuge in body, mind, and **sacred life**,\nAnd prostrate ourselves with our heads to the ground.\n\nRelying on the **Supreme Three** and the **Ten Directions’ Saints**,\nWe humbly pray that the **virtue/power** of these incense offerings\nMay flow back to the **Sacrificial Host** of the certain household,\nTo themselves, their descendants, and all kin—both inner and outer—\nThat their **wealth and longevity** may be extended,\nTheir sins and blemishes purged,\nTheir calamities and misfortunes dispelled,\nTheir blessings and auspicious signs abundantly attained,\nAnd that this grace may universally reach all beings—human and celestial—\nSharing equally in immense blessings.\n\nNow, this offering of incense,\nFrom the **virtue/power** of the **Teacher Treasure**—the **Great Saints**, the **Supreme Experts**, and the **True Ones**—whom we have taken refuge in.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way**,\nWe shall eternally safeguard eternal existence,\nAnd align our harmony with the **True Way**.\n\nRepentance for all directions,\nSubduing the **Life-Destroying Demon**,\nThree invocations, three obeisances.\n\nThe **Grand Lecture** commences, and we solemnly recite the **Dharma Rank**.\nWe, the subjects of certain rank, along with the officials present at the platform,\nWith utmost sincerity, humbly prostrate ourselves,\nAnd pray to the **Supreme Three**, the **Ten Directions’ Saints**, the **Highest Truths** of the **Ten Extremes**,\nThe **Martial Celestial Bureaus**, the **Divine Hosts of the Sacrificial Feast**,\nAnd the **True Sovereigns of the Ritual Banquet**,\nTo behold their boundless compassion,\nAnd to penetrate our earnest supplications with their radiant insight.\n\nWe, the subjects, hear the **True Transmission** of the **Ten Thousand Saints**,\nAnd the **Supreme Three’s** solemn teachings,\nWhich prioritize **saving lives** and **preserving sacred life**,\nAnd uphold the **orthodox Dharma** above all.\n\nFrom the **Three Caverns’ Treasure Sutras**,\nThe **Arcane Intentions of All the Heavens**,\nSome inwardly cultivate and close their vision,\nSwallowing light to nurture the **Primordial Essence**;\nSome refine **elixir** with **jade dew** and **jade frost**,\nUsing **five metals** and **nine cauldrons**;\nSome **conserve the spirit** and **consume the qi**,\nRestraining the **soul** and binding the **spirit**;\nSome **ascend with steps** and **vanish their form**,\nHiding in the heavens and concealing beneath the earth.\n\nAll seek to prolong their finite existence,\nAnd create the boundless beyond,\nSo that the **short-lived** may join the **long-lived**,\nAnd the **morning mushrooms** may rank with the **great cypress trees**,\nWith all **thousand-gated virtuous beings** enticed to refine their essence.\n\nSome, though foolish, grasp the **tale of capturing shadows**,\nWhile the **superior sages** attain the **effect of diligent practice**,\nClarifying the essential teachings—both ancient and modern—\nWhich all must follow.\n\nNow, the **Sacrificial Host** of the certain household,\nBy nature endowed with **orthodox truth**,\nAspires to the **profound mysteries**,\nAnd comprehends the **principles of Dao/Way-body cultivation** and **generation**.\nAt the moment of their birth, when their **original sacred life** was first bestowed,\nThey now begin this **ritual assembly** of **burning incense**,\nDevoting their minds to the **Ten Extremes**,\nProstrating before all the heavens,\nAnd turning the **sutras** while praying for the **True Ones** and seeking blessings.\n\nWe, the subjects, accordingly gather and follow,\nAdhering to the prescribed rituals,\nAnd with sincerity, we pray to the **Supreme Three’s** boundless grace.\n\nHumbly hoping that the **Supreme True Saints**,\nThe **Highest Exalted Ones** without limit,\nMay look down upon our petition,\nAnd shower us with their **auspicious blessings**,\nGranting us the **Vermilion Palace** and **Jade Gate**,\nAnd the **Celestial Hall of Literary Splendor**.\n\nMay **Han Jun** open the **scroll of longevity**,\nAnd **Sima Xi** record the **register of eternal life**.\nMay the **True Spirits** guard and protect,\nAnd may **harmony** be our only resource.\n\nThe **right official** shall shorten the **scriptures of premature death**,\nAnd the **left official** shall simplify the **calculations of extended life**.\nMay our **luck and lineage** be ever-broadened,\nOur **sins and karmic debts** forever erased,\nOur descendants and kin **prosper and content**,\nAnd both the **living and the dead** **thrive in peace**.\n\nWe further pray for the **Ten Thousand Years of the Emperor**,\nFor the **Altars of Earth and Grain** to remain secure,\nFor distant lands and foreign courts\nTo share the same scriptures and follow the same paths,\nFor the **Three Lights** to shine brightly and long,\nFor the **Six Qi** to spread in perfect harmony,\nFor crops to flourish and **Dragon Spirits** to aid in their growth,\nFor no **diseases or epidemics** in the year,\nFor the people to live in **contentment and prosperity**,\nAnd for the **Night Capital** and **Passage of the Dark Waters**,\nThe **Three Realms** and **Six Paths**,\nTo be blessed with the **extinguishing of suffering**,\nAnd the **opening of the path by celestial light**,\nSo that all may emerge from darkness,\nAnd be fully granted ascension and enlightenment,\nReaching the **Ten Extremes** and extending to the **Nine Enclosures**,\nAnd all **sentient beings—mobile, stationary, and spiritual**—\nMay together ascend to the **Realm of Longevity**.\n\nAbove, we honor the **Great Heavenly Sovereign’s** boundless compassion,\nBelow, we fulfill our subjects’ **sacred life** of sincerity.\n\nRespectfully submitted for your knowledge.\n**Knowledge of the Ritual Bell**—the **Twelve Vows** are fulfilled.\n\nThe **Grand Lecture** commences—**preserving the spirit** while burning incense**.\nThe **High Functionary** restores the altar.\n\nThe **Incense Officials** and **Messengers**,\nThe **Dragon-Tiger Lords** to the left and right,\nAnd the **Attendant Spirits** of the incense,\nShall direct us to the place where we previously ascended the platform in the evening assembly,\nWhere naturally arise **Golden Elixir** and **Lapis Lazuli Green**,\n**Mushrooms and herbs**, and countless **spiritual beings**,\nAs the **True Ones** gather in assembly,\nRight before this incense burner.\n\nMay all **Ten Directions’ Celestial Maidens and Immortal Boys**,\nAttending with **orchid-scented incense**,\nTransmit our previous supplications in earnest,\nSwiftly reaching the **Supreme True Dao/Way** without limit,\nThe **Three Pure Ones** and **Three Realms** of the **Heavenly Sovereigns**,\nThe **August Heavenly Jade Emperor**,\nThe **Grand Sovereign of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure**,\nAnd the **Great Emperor of the Northern Dipper**,\nBefore their **Celestial

**Mountain-Cave Perfected Immortals**, the **Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits**, and **All True Essences**.\n\nI have heard that the **Wondrous Root of Spontaneity** establishes transformations through circumstances,\nCrafting Heaven and Earth, containing the void’s essence.\nThe sun and moon thereby emit their light, and the **Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch** take their positions.\nThe **Heavenly Primordial and Earthly Treasury** govern the **Yang Officials and Yin Attendants**, distributing myriad spirits to rule all beings.\nTo **remove calamities and bestow blessings**, the **River Chart’s** clear decrees were revealed;\nTo **repent transgressions and seek mercy**, the **Great One** established the **Expiatory Offerings**.\n\nOur duty lies in **opening salvation and

harmonizing with the **True Dao/Way**.\n\nWith this early court, ascending the platform to practice the Dao/Way,\nWe request the **Law-Assembly** to kindle this **second incense-stalk** and offer it

this early court, ascending the platform to practice the Dao/Way,\nWe request the **Law-Assembly** to kindle this **third incense-stalk** and offer it aloft.\nMay this incense-smoke ascend directly to heaven, **supplying the Supreme True Master Treasure**.\nWe **repent our bodies, repent our spirits, repent our fates**, prostrating our heads to the earth.\n\nWe rely upon the **Most High Three Sovereigns** and the **Ten Directions’ Multitudes of Saints**,\nWishing that the merit of this incense-stalk may flow into **my person**,\nSo that the **Six Qi** may be harmonized and the **hundred passages** adjusted in order.\n**Accumulated calamities and grievances** shall be washed away by Your grace;\n**Stagnant illnesses and deep afflictions** shall be cleansed by the **Numinous Wind**.\n\n「Midheaven bestows blessings, Southern Dipper extends years,\nAll kinsmen prosper, auspicious omens descend in secret.\n\nNow, having kindled this incense, we rely upon the **Law-Assembly**

**Law-Assembly’s sacred rank** again.\n\nWith **my person** and the assembled officials at the platform, we earnestly and sincerely petition:\nThe **Three Pure Ones**, **Ten Directions’ Multitudes of Saints**, the **two ranks of the Ritual Feast**,\nAnd the **limitless array of holy beings**, humbly gazing upon Your vast compassion,\nPiercingly descending, Your radiant discernment.\n\nWe, Your disciples, reflect upon the **origin of our primordial essence and spirit**,\nThe **commencement of our vital *qi***—countless *kalpas* since that day,\nUntil this present moment—**we have not understood karmic retribution**,\nNor recognized **causal connections** (*yinyuan*).\nOur **threefold actions** have accumulated wrongs,\nAnd the **six dusts** have piled afflictions,\nViolating the **Heavenly Sovereign’s generative Dao/Way**,\nBreaking the **Earthly Sovereign’s prohibitions and taboos**,\nImpairing the **Four Seasons’ responsive functions**,\nAnd losing the **nature of all things to fulfill their destiny**.\nThus, we have **harmed and killed**,\nAnd **injured all sentient beings**—**unaware and ignorant**,\nAccumulating infinite transgressions.\n\nOur **past sins remain unrepented**, and **future crimes grow heavier**.\nThe **Three Officials and Five Emperors** record them in **black scriptures**,\nWhile the **Taiyueh and Luocheng offices** mark them in **scarlet tablets**.\nPerhaps due to **threefold fate’s malevolence and five agents’ suppression**,\nOr **stars’ ill-omened conjunctions and divine retribution**—\nOr because of **laborious toil, felling forests, transporting stones**,\n**Hewing trees, excavating hills**, **disturbing dragon spirits**,\nAnd **violating prohibitions and taboos**—\nWe have thus incurred **sickness and calamity**, yet **no cure has come**.\nOur **true *qi*** is unbalanced, and the **Three Elements** are disordered.\n\nDaring to rely upon the **ritual canons**, we establish this **Dao/Way altar**,\nPouring forth **sincere sincerity** below, and **praying to the Mysterious Saints** above,\nFor **infinite sins and offenses**—**all begging for repentance and absolution**.\n\nWe **humbly hope** that the **Multitudes of Saints** will descend their light,\nAnd the **Ten Thousand Truths** will turn their gaze,\nFlowing **great compassion’s grace** and bestowing **limitless mercy’s favor**,\nCommanding the **Four Sovereigns** and **Nine Palaces** to:\nFor **my disciple’s person**, **erase the register of death**,\n**Inscribe a new name in the celestial ledger**,\n**Remove calamity and dispel disaster**,\n**Harmonize grievances and resolve conflicts**,\n**Cleanse past stains** and **level accumulated wrongs**.\nThe **stars’ ill-omened conjunctions** shall cease their influence,\nAnd the **yearly *qi*’s suppressions** shall fade their retribution.\nThe **Blue Emperor** shall **extend his protective tally**,\n**Recording liver and safeguarding soul**,\nThe **White Emperor** shall **transfer our name**,\n**Quieting spirit and calming lungs**,\nThe **Star of Destiny** shall **guard our kidneys**,\nAnd the **Mars Star** shall **settle our heart**.\n\nThe **Yellow Court True Person** shall **harmonize our spirit and preserve our organs**,\nWhile the **Heavenly Physician** approaches from the east,\nThe **Grand Unity’s true essence**—**divine medicine hidden in reserve**—shall **descend as numinous dew**.\n**Malevolent influences** shall dissolve at our will,\nAnd **illnesses** shall vanish like mist.\n**Blessings and longevity** shall eternally extend,\nWhile **disasters and decline** shall utterly cease.\n\nWe pray that the **Emperors’ sacred diagram** endure forever,\nAnd the **Saints’ virtue/power** shine resplendently,\nThat the **Four Seas** shall have no turmoil,\nAnd the **Eight Strings** (*Eight Winds*) shall bring **great harmony**.\n**Weapons** shall naturally be laid aside,\nAnd **grain** shall flourish abundantly—\n**The Sovereign** shall be **holy**, his **ministers loyal**,\nAnd the **Heaven** and **Earth** shall be **serene and tranquil**.\n\nYet we also beg for **my disciple’s household**:\nThe **Nine Mysteries** to enjoy **blessings**,\nThe **Seven Ancestors** to attain **Heaven**,\nThe **Five Clans** to dwell in **peace**,\nAnd the **Six Relatives** to live in **harmony**.\nThe **springs of the Nine Abysses** shall resound with **no voices of guilt**,\nAnd the **Three Realms** shall merge, **Six Realms** renounce **the cycle of rebirth**.\n**Flight and movement** shall be **stilled**,\nAnd **sentient beings**—**all who know**—shall **partake in eternal life’s fruit**,\nTogether **drinking from the vast salvific grace**,\n**All attaining the Dao/Way of enduring life**.\n\nAbove, we **manifest the Heavenly Sovereign’s boundless compassion**,\nBelow, we **fulfill our disciples’ repentance and gratitude**.\n\nWe **respectfully present this petition** to be heard.\n*Knowing the

heard that the Primordial One formed the cosmos,\nThe One Essence congealed the light—\nHeaven and earth received their authority,\nYin and yang moved to generate and transform.\nProsperity and decline alternate; virtue and vice diverge.\nThe sun and moon have their cycles of decline;\nCold and heat follow their appointed courses.\nOnly this Great Dao unifies the seen and unseen,\nExtending blessings and rest,\nBroadly aiding all beings.\n\nWe have early explored the True Secrets, glimpsed the numinous diagrams.\nThe Three Caverns’ jade cases hold expiatory rites;\nThe Nine Heavens’

spirits,\nAssisting the nation in its deeds,\nSupporting the perilous and saving all things.\nFor any supplication made, how could it not be reported to the heavens?\n\n**The Petition’s Words:**\nAs the words declare, the intent is sincere and devout.\nThis disciple, still bound by calamity and not yet freed from illness,\nProstrates before the heavens, baring our hearts to the Dao,\nRequesting the elevation of this solemn fast,\nThat numinous power descend to aid us,\nThat our sincere offerings may meet with celestial favor.\n\nWith this late evening ritual, ascending the altar to practice the Dao,\nWe pray the assembled Daoists to light the first incense strand,\nThat this incense smoke may ascend directly to heaven,\nOffering to the Most High True Dao Treasure.\nWe, disciples, prostrate body, spirit, and fate.\nRelying on the Three Supreme Ones and the Ten-Directional Saints,\nMay the merit of this incense strand flow to the Emperor’s Nine Temples,\nIlluminating the Three

well-being,\nHarmonizing with the True Dao.\n\nRepentance offered, demonic influences subdued,\nThree invocations, three obeisances.\nReaffirming the sacred rank.\n\nWith sincerity, we—disciple [name] and the ritual officials—\nHumbly present our heartfelt supplication to the Three Pure Ones and Supreme Deities,\nThe Ten Extremes’ High Immortals,\nThe Three Realms’ ritual assembly,\nAnd the Two

illuminating virtue,\nViolating the nature of the Two Qi and Five Phases,\nDisrupting the harmony of the Three Lights and Six Seasons.\n\nPast grievances unresolved, future sins accumulating,\nTaking life recklessly, acting without restraint,\nIgnorant of cause and effect, heedless of taboos.\nThe passions’ stirrings offend both seen and unseen,\nThe three actions’ deeds transgress sacred teachings.\nThus, we incur retribution, inviting disaster and peril.\n\nAgain, we fear provoking Dragon spirits,\nUndertaking earthworks and construction,\nEncroaching on geomantic harmony,\nOr defying the seasons’ natural order.\nAgain, we fear the influence of celestial portents,\nYearly cycles of misfortune,\nThe Nine Palaces’ penal influences,\nAnd the Eight Trigrams’ conflicting obstacles.\n\nSickness and misfortune deepen, danger pressing near—\nWe dare invoke the ritual, repent our transgressions,\nBurn incense and light lamps,\nPraying to Heaven and beseeching fate,\nThat calamities and sins may be absolved,\nSo that the Primordial One may extend life,\nThe Three Elements may reverse death,\nSpirit-children may administer remedies,\nThe Great Emperor may descend with talismans,\nThe Six Ministries may harmonize,\nAnd the Hundred Passages may flow freely,\nBestowing longevity and prosperity,\nExtinguishing misfortune and nurturing blessings.\n\nMay disciple [name]’s household ascend to the Nine Ancestors’ celestial realm,\nWith all kin receiving protection,\nThe Nine Hells and Six Realms’ beings—\nAll creatures, flying, swimming, or rooted—\nEach attaining their rightful place,\nAll sharing in blessings and fortune.\n\nAbove, we pray for the Dragon’s grand design to endure,\nHeaven and Earth to last eternally,\nCultural virtue to flourish and

reunite in the Mystic Vault.\nThe hundred grains shall yield without fail, the three agricultural labors prosper,\nNo epidemics shall arise, floods and droughts shall not intrude,\nWinds and rains shall come in season, arms shall forever rest,\nAll sentient beings included.\n\nBelow, even the spirits of the underworld,\nRiver and mountain officials,\nYin and Yang ministers—\nPunishing evil and aiding the righteous,\nPropagating the Dao and bringing peace,\nAscending together to the Dao’s shore—\nThus, above we honor the Heavenly Sage’s boundless compassion,\nBelow we fulfill our disciples’ sincere repentance.\n\nHumbly presented for divine acknowledgment.\n\nThe ritual bell is struck; the Twelve Vows are proclaimed.\nThe Grand Lecture commences; the spirit is focused, incense is burned.\nThe High Functionary restores the altar.\nThe Incense Officials and Messengers—\nLeft and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,\nAttendant Spirit Officials—\nShall now command that where disciple [name]

attachments**.\n\n...\n\nFor **lust and hatred** are rampant, yet our **nature** stands as lofty as **lofty bamboo**;\nOur **hearing and seeing** are dull, yet our **wisdom** is as blind as the deaf.\n\nWe cannot **guard our outer form**,\nYet suffer **many afflictions of the body**;\nWe cannot **restrain our speech**,\nYet commit **many transgressions of the tongue**.\n\nWhere the **mind** reaches, **desire** follows;\nWith **accumulated deeds**, we forge **endless sins**.\n\nNow, facing the **Supreme Reality** and **repenting in earnest**,\nWe **cultivate the wondrous Dao** with **sincere practice**.\n\nAll **actions arise from the six roots**,\nEach **particle of dust** is **delusion itself**;\nWho among us does not bear **suffering in the body**?\nEach **worldly thing** obscures the **True Nature**.\n\nThus, at this **sacred altar**,\nWe **banish all malevolent obstacles** in their entirety.\n\nWith **mind** purified and **inner contemplation** unimpeded,\nOur **nature** remains **void and pristine**, and **external phenomena** no longer ensnare us.\n\nAll **flattery and deceit** are **severed**,\nEvery **greed and malice** is **cleansed away**.\n\nPast **karmic deeds** shall never again lead us to **fall into ruin**;\nFuture **new afflictions** shall not be **cast into the abyss**.\n\nMay we **preserve our body** and **avoid all sins**,\nNever **pursue worldly gain** while **forgetting the True Way**.\n\nHumbly, we pray that all **sages** may **perceive clearly**,\nThat the **August Spirit** extends **far-reaching illumination**,\nSo that the **jewels of the Peach Blossom Spring** may **wash and purify** all hearts,\nAnd the **sweet dew of the Dao’s radiance** may **cleanse away** every stain.\n\nMay the **root of crimes** be **extinguished**,\nAnd the **luminous wisdom-nature** attain **perfect clarity**;\nMay our **devotion to goodness** be **steadfast and sincere**,\nAnd we **await the blessings** of the **descending grace**.\n\nWith **calamity sunk to the nine depths**,\nAnd **mercy rising to the ten directions**,\nYour servants **bow in reverence** and offer **gratitude** to the **Supreme and Natural Three Treasures**.\n\nWe **declare the True Scripture**,\nAnd when the **ritual master** raises the **metal bell**,\nWe **thrice chant and thrice prostrate** in homage,\n**Reaffirming the sacred law’s position**.\n\nYour servants, **[Name]** and the **congregated ritual officials**,\nWith **unified sincerity**, humbly petition:\n**Primordial Heavenly Sovereign of Natural Beginning**,\n**Supreme Dao

Altars and Peaks**,\n**Responsive to the Three Realms**,\n**All True Spirits**.\n\nYour servants hear that **Heaven does not manifest omens**,\nYet **silently grants** the **command of preordained fate**;\nThat the **Emperor can descend judgments**,\nAnd **graciously bestows** the **sentiments of divine favor**.\n\nThe servants, with zeal and earnestness, shall surely be guided to meet with **auspicious blessings**.\n\nWe, the ministers, follow the prescribed rites and laws,\nPresenting clear and solemn rituals,\nOpening the altar with the solemnity of evening’s vigil,\nSpeaking with heartfelt sincerity.\n\nWe seek to benefit the realm and family,\nTo universally aid both the living and the departed.\nWe begin with the **preliminary fasting and purification**,\nAnd the **auspicious opening of the True Hall**,\nAs the **Celestial Dragon** ascends its petition,\nAnd the **feathered banners** scatter in procession—\nMay the **Divine Spirit** behold us.\n\nThe **Sacred Chariot** demonstrates Heaven’s will,\nIts power near at hand.\nMay we preserve and perfect all matters,\nThat both humans and celestial beings may be enriched;\nMay we achieve and refine our **cultivation and merit**,\nThat our aspirations may flourish and be fulfilled.\n\nWith sincerity now revealed, blessings take root,\nAnd the disciples’ words are earnestly declared.\n**The Declaration is spoken.**\n\nExamine the words with clarity,\nSee the sincerity within.\nExhaust all pure intentions to redouble our efforts,\nAnd gaze upon the **True Dao** until enlightenment dawns.\n\nGathered in the **crimson robes**, the assembly converges,\nThe **cloud-seals** unfold in number,\nThe **ornate altar** stands as **swords and girdles** draw near,\nThe **jade halberds** turn with the **banners’ shadows**.\n\nReverently presenting the **precious offerings** as tribute,\nWe pour the **sacred wine** to commune with the spirits.\nThe **bell and incense** resound in harmony,\nAs the **sincere words** are uttered in unison;\nThe **incense’s qi** ascends with the **virtue’s fragrance**.\n\nThus, the **dark and luminous** are in communion,\nAnd the **Highest Spirits** respond with manifest grace.\n\nWe, the ministers, having assembled and taken our roles,\nFollow the rites to proclaim the **sacred formulas**,\nFirst invoking the **yin-time precepts**,\nTaking today’s altar-opening as the commencement,\nAnd proceeding with the **lawful rites**.\n\nWe humbly pray to the **Supreme Three Venerables**,\nThe **Ten Directions’ Holy Assembly**,\nThe **Playground of the Mystic Middle**’s Grand Master,\nThe **Responsive True Spirits**—\nCommanding the **Supervising Officials of the Fasting Bureau** and the **Earthly Officials**,\nTo solemnly array the **Awe-Inspiring Spirits**,\nTo strictly consecrate the **altar’s precincts**,\nThat the **cloud-hosts may gather in ranks**,\nAnd the **Heavenly Ensigns** may arrive,\nSo that **evil and impurity may be purged**,\nAnd the **dust and miasma** kept far away,\nThat the cosmos may be serene and still,\nAnd the **Eight Winds** cease to stir.\n\nMay our **spirit and qi** remain steadfast,\nOur thoughts ever **sensitive to response**,\nOur petitions ascending to the Highest,\nOur **fasting merits** fully accomplished.\n\nAt dawn’s clarity and morning’s purity,\nWe proceed according to the **Law** and the **Way**,\nContinuing to present our petitions.\n\n**The Vow is made.**\n\nThe **Grand Assembly** is convened,\nThe **spirit is focused**, incense is burned.\nThe **High Functionary** restokes the incense burner.\nThe **Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, and the **Attendant Spirits of Incense**—\nLet it be that at the very place where we have previously established the altar,\n**Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** shall naturally arise,\n**Mushrooms and Hundred Spirits** flourish,\nThe **Multitudes of True Ones** gather here before this incense burner.\n\nMay our **ant-like sincerity** ascend to the Highest,\nAnd the **Phoenix Palanquin** descend in response,\nExamining the **Five Aggregates of our devotion**,\nFulfilling the **entire altar’s wish**,\nThat **disaster not arise** and **calamity not take root**,\nThat **longevity may extend** and **blessings multiply**,\nThat our **descendants and their descendants** may turn to ever-greater honor and nobility,\nAnd that the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Children and Jade Maidens**,\nAttending in the **orchid mist**,\nMay transmit our previously declared sincerity\nSwiftly to the **Supreme, Boundless, Great Dao**,\nThe **Three Pure Ones, Most Holy**,\nBefore the **August Heaven’s Golden Gate, Jade Sovereign Emperor of Heaven**.\n\nThe **metal chimes** are struck,\nThe **praise is chanted in the hall**.\n\nExit the hall,\nLead to the **Six-Curtain Pavilion**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way Gate’s Complete Rules and Rituals**, Volume Seven concluded,\nVolume Eight begins: **Master Guangcheng Du Guangting’s** edited and refined **Rituals for Disaster Elimination**—\n**Setting the Jiao/Expiation Ritual** and **Performing the Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **Grand Master** raises the **Assembly of the Dao/Way**,\nEach **officiant** and **disciple** observes the **Precepts** with reverence, as prescribed.\n\nThe **High Functionary** proclaims the **Soul-Guarding Incantations** of the **Five Stars**,\nTheir **illumination** shines forth across the **Five Directions**—\n**Water Star** repels disasters, **Wood Virtue** brings prosperity.\n**Mars** dissipates calamities, **Jupiter** wards off armies.\n**Venus** steadies the four quarters, **benefiting** both **family and state**.\nTheir **names** are inscribed on **jade tablets**, their **words** recorded in the **Celestial Archives**—\n**Riding the gusts** and **scattering the mists**, they **soar through the boundless void**,\n**Entering and exiting the unseen realms**, they **roam and feast** across the **Ten Directions**.\nThe **Five Clouds** rise as their canopy, **summoning gods** and **subduing winds**,\n**Commanding all spirits**, they stand guard before the **Celestial Sage**,\nIn **harmony** with the **Dao/Way’s** and the **True Ones’** essence.\n\nThe **Assembly of the Dao/Way** is raised,\nThe **Law-Drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.\n\nThe **High Functionary** ignites the **Incense Furnace**—\nTo the **Supreme Three Heavens**, the **Primordial Origin of the Three Qi’s**,\nThe **Most High Laozi**, summoning forth from

in the **petition scrolls**.\nMay the **Most High Ten Directions’ Pure Ones** and the **Primordial Qi of the Dao/Way** descend,\nTheir **Sacred Treasures and Auspicious Light** flowing into **my body**,\nSo that my **declared sincerity** may swiftly reach\nThe **Supreme, Boundless, Great Dao/Way**,\nThe **Three Pure Ones, Most Holy**,\nThe **Golden Gate of the August Heaven, Jade Sovereign Emperor of Heaven**.\n\nThe **Assembly of the Dao/Way** is raised,\nAnd the **Law-Position** is invoked.\n\nWith **all ranks** present, I, **your humble servant**, [name],\nAlongside the **gathered officiants and disciples**,\nNow **jointly declare our sincerity**—\nTo the **Voidless, Natural Primordial Origin**,\nThe **Most High Jade Morning Dao/Way Lord**,\nThe **Most High Golden Gate Laozi**,\nThe **Most High Jade Sovereign Emperor of Heaven**,\nThe **Nine Sovereigns, Most Venerable**,\nThe **Ten Directions’ Sacred Treasures**,\nThe **Heavenly Great Emperors**,\nThe **Thirty-Six

**True Rulers of the Nine Heavens**,\nThe **Three Mountains and Five Peaks**, the **Lodges of Auspicious Peace**,\nThe **Abyssal Palaces of the Earthly Deeps**, the **Masters of the Altars and Mountains**,\nThe **Responsive Spirits of the Three Realms**,\nAll **True and Sacred Essences**.\n\nI have heard:\nThe **Jade Heaven’s** distance is vast, yet **hardly ascended** by those in **great calamity**;\nThe **Golden Gate’s** heights are lofty, yet **merely gazed upon** by those in **humble lodgings**.\n\nThe **Most Venerable Sovereign** holds sway above,\nThe **Primordial Transformation** abides in the **center**.\nHe **opens the Ten Directions’ unobstructed hearts**,\n**Responding to all things** with **action**—\nHe is the **Father of Great Compassion** across the **Three Realms**,\n**Viewing all beings** with **pity**.\n\nFrom the **Elevated Platform** to the **Lowly Dust**, from the **Unfolding of the Cosmic Scroll** to the **Tossing of the Mustard Seed’s Calamity**,\nHe **looks back** upon the **myriad myriads**, lamenting the **fleeting life** of the **Jin Dynasty’s insects**;\nHe **gazes down** upon the **nine dusts**, sighing for the **Han Palace’s ants**.\n\nI, **your humble servant**, reflect upon my **lowly station**,\nMy **fate severed** from the **Celestial Path**—\nThus, I **rely upon** the **received teachings** and **rituals**,\nAnd **diligently** explore the **subtle depths** of my **sincere supplications**.\n\nNow, I, **your humble disciple**, [name],\n**Hold the sacred talisman** and **seal the Dao/Way’s court**,\nHoping that **benevolent Heaven** may **observe below**,\nAnd **perceive my slightest virtue** amidst the **dust of the world**.\n\nI **humbly pray** that the **Nine Pure Ones, Most Holy**,\nFrom the **Palace of the Curved and Secret**,\nAnd the **Ten Extremes’ Primordial Sovereign**,\nFrom the **Celestial Chariot of the Flying Void**,\nWith **hundreds of millions of Heavenly Servants** trailing behind,\nAnd **thousands of officials** leading forth—\n**Hurl flames ten thousand li**, calling forth **Yang** while summoning **Yin**;\n**Turn incense in three cycles**, ascending from **sun** to **moon**.\n\nTo the **furthest East**, they **roam in scorching waters**,\nTo the **furthest West**, they **behold the setting of the Pei River’s mists**,\nTo the **South**, they **construct the Vermilion Peak’s Palace**,\nIn the **Center**, they **encircle the Yellow Congealing’s Hall**,\nTo the **North**, they **reach the Night City’s Gate**,\nBelow, they **exhaust the Chilly Spring’s depths**.\n\nIt is said that **Lu** is **called the Teacher of the Dao/Way**,\nFollowing the **Great Primordial** in its **procession**—\nAnd **Xi** is **named the World-Honored Sage**,\nFrom the **extension of the True Ones** and their **secret attendance**.\n\nThe **Primordial Sovereign’s** **divine command**—\nWho **dares not** **revere it**?\nI **bow my heart** in **sincere supplication**,\nAnd **look up** to the **cloud-borne arrival**.\n\nI, **your humble disciple**, [name],\nWith the **fasting officiants**,\n**Cannot express** our **deepest reverence**—\nWe **kneel and prostrate**, **twice bowing**, to **welcome the Sacred Procession**.\n\nThe **Celestial Chariot** arrives and **halts**,\nThe **Crane-Drawn Palanquin** **descends to the court**,\nAnd **gathers with the Jiao’s assembled spirits**,\nAs **rituals of morning worship** are **performed**.\n\nAfter the **morning worship** is **completed**,\nWe **request permission** to **ascend the Jiao platform**—\nThe **officiants** **present incense**,\nAnd **offer the first libation**.\n\nThe **metal chimes** are struck,\n**Flowers are scattered**, and **music is played**.\n\nWith **all ranks** present, I, **your humble disciple**, [name],\nAlongside the **gathered platform officials**,\nNow **renew my sincerity**—\nTo the **Three Pure Ones, Most Holy**, the **Treasure Realm’s True Spirits**.\n\nIndeed,\nThe **Primordial Scene** is **universally spread**—\nThere is **no distinction** between **high and low**;\nThe **myriad myriads’ forms** are **all nurtured** by the **Pure and Gentle Qi**.\n\nSince **life and death** are **distant realms**,\nAnd **likes and dislikes** are **profoundly manifold**—\nThe **filthy body** may **indulge in depravity**,\nYet the **Great Dao/Way** **ever descends** to **bestow virtue**.\n\nSome **offenses** are **deep-rooted**,\nAnd **fears** of **karmic retribution** may **lie hidden**.\nIf one **awakens** to the **hundred faults**,\nThen **all calamities** are **dissipated**.\n\nNow, I, **your humble disciple**, [name],\n**Recognize** my **spirit’s stagnation** and **soul’s terror**—\nFrom the **great calamity**, I **have fallen into ruin**,\nAnd **lost the Primordial Essence**, **fleeing in agitation**.\n\nI **do not climb** the **Awakening Tree**,\nYet **take delight** in the **flaming peak**;\nI **do not enter** the **True Court**,\nYet **am content** to **burn in the House of Fire**.\n\nThe **Six Tribunals** **run wild**, the **Three Karmas** **entangle me**—\nOnly through the **Highest Sage’s** **proclaimed compassion**,\nThe **Great Shelter** for **sentient beings**, may **salvation** be **opened**.\n\nNow, I, **your humble disciple**, [name],\n**Return to the Dao/Way** and **bow my head**,\n**Praying** for **Heaven’s vast mercy**—\nI **humbly beg** the **Most Holy Upper Spirits**,\nThe **Highest True Emperors**,\nTo **bestow grace** and **deliver my suffering**,\nTo **grant life** and **remove my calamities**.\n\n「Now I humbly seek to **resolve the karmic debts of my mortal form**,\nAnd **erase the dark records of my past sins**.\n\n**Before their appointed time**, my crimes shall be **cleared as ice**,\nAnd **my misdeeds awaited**, like **refined clouds** in the sky.\n\n**I kneel in submission**, awaiting **divine response**,\n**Withdrawing my earthly concerns** to **offer my heartfelt plea**.\n\nI wish to **present my words sincerely**,\nAnd **enter the sacred threshold** with **devout reverence**.\n\nThough I have **already pondered deeply**,\nI still **fear discrepancies**,\nYet **dare to violate Heaven’s prohibitions**,\nAnd **tremble in awe** as I **submit my petition**.\nWith **pure intent and solemn sincerity**,\nI **solemnly vow** to **proclaim my supplications**.\n\n**My words are presented**—\nAs they speak, **the scripture’s logic is deeply resonant**.\n**I bare my blood-and-guts devotion**,\nAnd **pour forth my heart’s true essence**.\n\n**I bow in humility**, extending **my childlike sincerity**,\nAnd **hope to fulfill** the **quota of reverence**.\n\n**I look upward**, beseeching **the Most Holy Celestial Spirits**,\nThe **Three Bureaus’** **mighty and numinous presence**,\nTo **bestow their radiant grace**,\nAnd **pierce through with their luminous discernment**.\n\n**I humbly pray** that my **rites of purification** be **recorded in the celestial ledgers**,\nAnd **my Daoist attainments** **benefit my being**,\nTo **increase my lifespan and prosperity** in **the future**,\nAnd **preserve my longevity and fortune** in **the past**.\n\n**I rely upon the Most Holy’s virtue**,\nAnd **shall seek their blessings and protection**.\n\nI, **your humble disciple**, along with **the Daoist ritual officials**,\n**With utmost earnestness**, **prostrate myself twice**,\n**Offering incense and libations** in **final tribute**.\n\n**Music is played**.\n\nI **repeatedly express my sincerity**,\nAnd **report to the Nine Celestial Worthies of High Purity**,\nThe **Ten Supreme High Daoists**,\nThe **responsive assembly of all true spirits**.\n\nI **hear that the Jade Emperor observes with insight**,\nAnd the **Golden Worthies** **attend with scrutiny**,\n**Moved by the universal reverence** of **sentient beings**,\nAnd **bestowing blessings** upon **all ranks and kinds**.\n\nThe **worthy scholar** **aspires to transcendence**,\nAnd **is thus rewarded** by the **thousands of true spirits**.\nThe **virtuous person** **seeks blessings**,\nAnd **is thus granted** the **hundreds of harmonious virtues**.\n\n**Daoist nobility is refined and subtle**,\nAnd **rites must align with divine resonance**.\n\nNow, I, **your humble disciple**,\n**Raise my voice in the pure night**,\n**Express my earnest intent at the crimson gate**,\nAnd **present my sincere heart**, **hoping to receive celestial favor**.\n\n**I humbly pray** for **release from worldly entanglements**,\nAnd **advancement to the Daoist stages**.\n\nMay my **entire household** **be illuminated** like the **Lius**,\nAnd **all ascend to the Pavilion of Harmony**;\nOr like the **entire clan of Liu Gang**,\nAnd **universally rise to the Single Green Heaven**.\n\nMay I **escape the cycles of yin and yang**,\nAnd **forever sever the roots of life and death**.\n\nWhether **seeking worldly gains through officialdom**,\nOr **accumulating wealth through commerce**,\n**All shall achieve** **eminence and prosperity**;\n**Nobles and commoners alike**, **within and without**, **thrive in splendor**.\n\nMay **grievances between the living and the dead** cease,\nAnd **all paths** **yield the beauty of harmonious blessings**.\nMay **equitable joy and prosperity** **continue unbroken**,\nAnd **blessings extend to near and far**.\n\nDisasters of **water, fire, military strife, and bandits**—\n**None shall intrude upon my home**.\nCalamities of **husbands, wives, daughters, and sons**—\n**None shall harm my body**.\n\nMay **all my descendants be preserved in life**,\nAnd **our lineage’s sacred fires** **endure eternally**.\n\nI, **your humble disciple**, along with **the Daoist ritual officials**,\n**With utmost fervor**, **prostrate myself twice**,\n**Offering incense and libations** in **final tribute**.\n\n**Music is played**.\n\nI **repeatedly express my sincerity**,\nAnd **report to the Three Bureaus’ true spirits**,\nThat the **rites of purification** **are now complete**,\nAnd the **month of offerings** **has concluded in the Grand Compliance**.\n\nThe **phoenix crown and lamp flames**—\n**Soon shall dim** in the

(三界应感)**,\nand **all the True Spirits**.\n\nI have **heard that in ancient times, during the延康 era (Yán-Kāng)**,\n**the *qi* had not yet divided into purity and turbidity**;\n**when the Great Polarity was first established (肇判太极)**,\n**form was then properly aligned with the square and round**.\n\nThe One generates the Two, and the Two generates the Three;\nEarth follows Heaven, and Heaven follows the Dao.\n\nAbove, the stars and constellations are arrayed;\nBelow, the mountains and rivers are arranged.\n\nThe Three Pure Ones are the most exalted of all saints,\nThe Four Palaces receive the duties of myriad spirits.\n\nBeyond the dim and obscure, within the vague and indistinct,\nSome form palaces from mist,\nOthers build halls from gathered clouds.\n\nThe assembled immortals stand in ranks,\nPaying homage to the august Sovereign of the Great Effulgence;\nThe myriad phenomena revolve in harmony,\nBowing in reverence to the Purple Enceinte Emperor.\n\nEven unto the Great Thousandfold Sand Realm,\nThe Boundless Divine Realm,\nPalaces bear names of springs and curves,\nMountains bear names of Luo and Teng.\n\nOfficials govern over Heaven, Earth, and Water,\nDepartments are divided into left, right, and center.\n\nThe Thirty-Six Tribunals, the Twenty-Four Prisons,\nDim as the tortoise peaks, vast as the peng sea.\nThe whale stirs waves and spews clouds and thunder,\nThe sea-serpent exhales mist and forms pavilions and halls.\n\nThe Golden Platforms and Jade Observatories\nLie beyond the Weak Waters, boundless in extent;\nThe Serpent Chambers and Dragon Palaces\nGuard the deep abyss, unfathomable in depth.\n\nThe saints of the Yang Interval,\nThe enshrined and honored deities,\nIf they can indeed be summoned by the Great Ritual,\nOr transformed to diligently serve,\nThe Yellow Emperor established their names,\nAnd the Hundred Things revered the Earthly Sovereign,\nRanked across the Nine Regions.\n\nEven unto the enfeoffments of prefectures and counties,\nThe city gods and their guardians,\nFor the sake of the state,\nThere are ancestral altars,\nRecorded in the sacrificial canons,\nIn accordance with the laws of the sage kings.\n\nThus, the Great Void is clear and bright,\nThe constellations shine resplendent,\nLanterns intermingle with orchid and cassia lights,\nIncense curls from sandalwood censers.\n\nI humbly pray for the cranes and phoenixes to harness,\nTheir ranks descending from the distant heavens;\nFor the wind-horses and cloud-chariots to pass in procession,\nDescending in majesty upon the mortal realm.\n\nThe humble臣 and the officials of the Ritual Bureau of代, in solemn obeisance and twice-bowed reverence, now present their respects and invite the Sacred Procession.\n\nLet the ranks of the Two Classes of Saints descend.\nThe Three Realms’ multitude of True Ones, arrayed upon the *jiào* feast, extend their prostrations and earnest petitions, humbly awaiting the radiant descent.\n\nMay they each align in the ranks of the Celestial Host,\nAnd together, with reverent deference, welcome the Imperial Procession.\n\nDescend, O Emperor, upon the Cloud-Carriage.\nWhen the Crane-Carriage arrives and halts,\nAnd the Phoenix-Carriage takes its place before the court,\nThe *jiào* feast’s assembled True Ones shall observe the ritual as in a grand audience.\n\nHaving completed the morning rites,\nWe request ascent to the *jiào* feast’s table,\nWhere the Ritual Officials shall offer incense,\nAnd arrange the first prostrations and libations of wine.\n\nLet the *zhì* bell be struck,\nScatter the flowers,\nAnd perform the music.\n\nWith the officials of all ranks and the humble臣某, in earnest sincerity, we now address:\nThe Three Pure Ones, Most Sacred,\nAnd the Precious Realm’s numinous spirits.\n\nWe have heard that the Idle Lotus Platform is the dwelling of the Most High;\nAnd the Great Floating Earth is where the Celestial Lord expounds the Dharma in its time.\n\nMoved by the inclination of a single nation’s heart,\nAnd the summoning of the Ten Directions to their seat.\n\nFirst ascending the Lion’s Peak,\nThen entering the Precious Pearl’s midst,\nThey guide the multitude of beings,\nAnd unfold the wondrous Dao.\n\nAt its beginning, in one passage,\nThe deaf and the ailing are all cured;\nAt its end, in ten repetitions,\nEven withered bones are reborn as whole.\n\nThe Four *qì* resound and clarify,\nIlluminating all spirits across the cosmos;\nThe Five Colors flourish in abundance,\nEnhancing the Celestial retinue in the void.\n\nFrom then on, the True Doctrine flourishes and spreads,\nIts profound teachings disseminated far and wide—\nAbove, to dispel calamities,\nBelow, to deliver the people.\n\nWithout the Two Luminaries, there would be no brightness;\nWithout the Two Principles, no order would stand.\nNone but the True Persons can fully know it,\nOnly the highest sages can practice it with might.\n\nWhen the Most High descended in the Zhou’s early years,\nAnd the Celestial Master arose in the Han dynasty,\nThey transmitted the method of presenting petitions and offerings,\nAnd demonstrated the rituals of establishing *zhāi* feasts and *jiào* ceremonies—\nIlluminated as if inscribed in crimson and gold,\nShining forth like the sun and moon.\n\nYet we, the humble臣, feel shame\nTo be reckoned among the Celestial Host;\nOur hearts are like scattered reeds, unable to grasp the Mystic Pass,\nAnd our eyes, like withered stalks, cannot peer into the Sacred Domain.\n\nWe hold the Yellow and Purple, yet know not the flow of the Seven Elixirs;\nWe emerge from the Blue and enter the Black, yet comprehend not the inhalation and exhalation of the Two *qì*.\n\nThough our understanding of the True Way is dim,\nOur foremost intent is to benefit the world.\nThus, the *jiào* master某, though bound in the mortal realm,\nTurns his heart to the Ultimate Dao,\nAnd with his entire clan offers solemn prayers,\nTwice-bowed in reverence, to welcome the True Ones.\n\nWe humbly reflect upon the lofty celestial signs,\nWhere responses echo like the reverberations of a bell;\nAnd the sincere yearnings of the common heart,\nWhere supplications and averting of misfortune find no greater efficacy than in pure devotion.\n\nThus, though millet and barley lack fragrance,\nIt is the white hemp that may be offered in devotion.\n\nThe sincerity and earnestness of our petitions\nAre fully expressed in these words.\nWith reverence before the lofty True Ones,\nWe solemnly declare them as follows:\n\n**Proclamation of Words:**\nAs the words attest, our devotion is sincere and profound.\nWhatever is proclaimed and inscribed shall surely be answered in kind.\n\nI have heard that the Three Bright Ones illuminate,\nAnd the Five Classics unfold—\nThese are called the Heavenly Roots,\nAnd thus they preserve the eons of the cosmos.\n\nThe Primordial Thread unfurls through all ten directions;\nThe Vital *qi* of the *Fan* pervades and gives rise to all things.\n\nWhen first the myriad creatures emerged,\nAnd the dark *yin* nurtured the common folk—\nTo govern blessings and calamities,\nThe stars and constellations shift in their courses;\nTo manifest responses and omens,\nThe thunder and lightning strike with wrath.\n\nOnly the Sovereign Emperor of Heaven\nRules supreme over all living beings;\nThe boundless Heaven above\nTruly enfolds and watches over the earth below.\n\nThus, there exist methods of purification and expiation,\nTo serve as rites of *jiào* and thanksgiving.\n\nThe *jiào* master某, humbly reflecting,\nKnows his nature is inherently flawed and borrowed,\nBorn into this mortal realm,\nYet blessed by the enlightened governance of the Sage Emperor,\nAnd steeped in the refined customs of the Central Kingdom.\n\nGreed, hatred, and delusion—\nHow could he escape transgression?\nBody, speech, and mind—\nHow could he be without fault?\n\n「From the countless ages past until this very life,\nSome have served their lords yet lacked true loyalty,\nOthers have tended their parents yet failed in filial piety—\nAbandoning kindness and thrift.\n\nSome have violated the teachings of the Three Treasures,\nCommitting theft and lewdness;\nOthers have transgressed the Nine True Precepts,\nHolding affection for monks while harboring deceit,\nCurving their words to flatter,\nPointing to Heaven and Earth to swear oaths,\nInvoking deities to curse and damn.\n\nIn trade and exchange, they seek only self-gain to harm others;\nIn actions and conduct, they act contrary to the True and betray the Dao.\n\nBelow, they chase fleeing beasts;\nAbove, they shoot winged fowl—\nWanton slaughter in the space between blade and board,\nUnrestrained revelry at the feast of cups and dishes.\n\nThus, their misdeeds sink deeper than the Stygian Sea,\nTheir sins accumulate higher than mountains—\nThe Three Corpses [三尸] chant in the vault above,\nThe Five Emperors [五帝] speak in the netherworld below.\n\nThe Master of Life seizes their fate,\nFor their deeds are unkind and their calamities remain.\n\nThe Way of Heaven brings disaster and affliction,\nYet they gain no merit through prayer.\n\nNow, in repentance and remorse,\nThey earnestly wish to purge all sins.\n\nThey rely on the boundless grace of the Supreme,\nAnd humbly beg for forgiveness of countless lives’ transgressions.\n\nFrom this day forward, may they never forget the resolve to amend;\nFor future deeds, may they find the path to true renewal.\n\nThe *jiào* master and officials, with utmost fervor,\nProstrate themselves in reverence, offering incense and libations.\n\nWe, the *jiào* master and officials, with sincere devotion,\nAddress the Three Pure Ones [三清] and the Celestial Saints [上圣],\nThe True Spirits of the Precious Realm [宝界真灵].\n\nWe hear that the Great Dao is formless,\nYet boldly named as *Dao*.\nAll things return to it yet it claims no ownership;\nThe common folk employ it yet cannot fathom its source.\n\nAt the wilds of Shāngchéng [襄城],\nEven the Seven Saints are lost;\nWithin the walls of Jùguó [束郭],\nThe Nine Years’ Great Mystery [九年大妙] is heard.\n\nThe method of *Fùmò* [副墨] began with the Lu recitation [洛诵],\nThe depths of *Xuānmíng* [玄冥] were drawn from Shānmíng [参寥].\n\nTo seek the fish, one must not forget the basket;\nTo exhaust the meaning, one must first establish the symbol.\n\nThen it is known that color is not color,\nAnd the Mystic Vision [玄览] reveals without blemish;\nThat emptiness is not emptiness,\nAnd the Void Chamber [虚室] gives birth to whiteness.\n\nTo perfect one’s nature begins with daily self-abnegation,\nTo restore one’s life ends with non-action.\n\nEntering the Gate of Profound Mysteries [众妙门],\nFree from all nets of doubt.\n\nThirty-six divisions,\nOver five thousand teachings—\nSome transmitted among mortals,\nOthers hidden in the heavens.\n\nThose who revere and honor them receive blessings,\nThose who slight or neglect them invite calamity.\n\nThe *jiào* master reflects on his humble, fleeting life,\nLike grass and insects, frail and insignificant—\nGazing upward to the lofty vault [高穹],\nTurning toward the Verdant Netherworld [碧落] in sincere devotion.\n\nLike the otter offering fish to its gods,\nHe hopes for the virtue of response and communion;\nLike the sunflower turning to the sun,\nHe seeks only to bend in prayerful reverence.\n\nThus, he recites the scriptures of the Three Caverns [三洞],\nAnd sustains the incense and flames for two or three hours.\n\nThe revolving *Xuánjī* [璇玑] aligns the heavens,\nThe resonant *Línláng* [琳琅] awakens all divine spirits.\n\nWith this most solemn offering,\nHe seeks the unending blessings of the Dao.\n\nAbove, he purges the Nine Solar Calamities [阳九之数],\nBelow, he expiates the One Hundred and Six Earthly Disasters [百六之灾].\n\nLong life and peace for the aged,\nSerenity within and without.\n\nHe records the names in the Celestial Register [丹台],\nAnd petitions the True Master of Fate [真君] to extend our years upon the Jade Tablets [青简].\n\nMay we live eternally, gazing far,\nDay by day growing richer, month by month prospering—\nEnjoying the fullness of the Five Auspicious Blessings [五福],\nAnd attaining a hundred years of enduring peace.\n\nThere must be lasting fortune,\nIn perfect accord with the *Yì* [《易》];\nAll inauspiciousness must be dispelled,\nConforming to the words of the Daoist Scriptures [仙经].\n\nWe, the *jiào* master and officials, with utmost supplication,\nProstrate ourselves in reverence, offering incense and libations.\n\nWith music played,\nWe, the humble officials and the assembled *jiào* attendants,\nWith sincere devotion,\nAddress the Supreme and Formless Sage [虚无至圣],\nThe True Spirits of the Three Realms [三界群真],\nHumbly awaiting their vast compassion,\nAnd their penetrating, enlightened discernment.\n\nWe hear that the Great Dao is profound and vast,\nAnd to seek it is no simple task.\n\nTrue grace is distant and unfathomable,\nAnd to attain it is most difficult.\n\nYet, how much more so when we dare to hope for private favor,\nWithout doubt deserving the merit of expiation.\n\nHow much more so when we offer our feeble prayers,\nAnd rely on sincerity of speech!\n\nWith earnest intent and reverent devotion,\nMay our words soak into the Sacred Hearing [圣聪],\nAnd our pleas reach the True Listening [真听].\n\nThe *jiào* master, though unworthy of life’s blessing,\nSeeks only what is good.\n\nHe fears the errors of the Three Karmic Actions [三业],\nAnd the taint upon the records of the Celestial Bureaucracy [列曹].\n\nThe stars and omens converge,\nAnd the calamitous numbers are upon us.\n\nIf not for the secret prayers of purification and expiation,\nHow could we hope for mercy and pardon?\n\nWe follow the prescribed rites and formulas,\nAnd solemnly list our petitions—\nBathing our bodies and minds in ritual purity,\nWith utmost sincerity, we present our prayers,\nHoping to ascend to the Primordial Pole [元极],\nAnd forever align with the common will.\n\nWe beseech thee, for the *jiào* master,\nTo purge celestial disasters,\nTo scatter earthly calamities—\nFreeing him from all misfortune within this year,\nFrom the four seasons’ months,\nFrom the movements of the Five Stars [五星],\nFrom the four pillars’ punishments [四柱相刑],\nFrom every inauspicious fate.\n\nMay his years of life be long and distant,\nLike the eternal pines and cypress;\nMay his calamities be stilled and never arise,\nLike the fragrant orchids and sweetgrass.\n\nMay music be played.」\n\n「The noble lineage shines with splendor,\nAnd descendants flourish in prosperity—\nBringing harmony and peace to the realm,\nEnjoying the pure and virtuous breezes of the age.\n\nThe Three Lights [三光] radiate brightly in the vault of heaven,\nAnd the Nine Crops [九稼] grow abundantly upon the earth below.\n\nBorder beacons cease their warnings,\nAnd the distant wilderness returns to the Way [仁].\n\nMountains and rivers display auspicious omens,\nAnd the numinous and divine [神明] gather blessings in concert.\n\nThe Three Realms [三涂] and Six Paths [六趣] alike rest in their hidden prisons no more.\nAll living, growing, flying, and submerged beings\nAre equally nurtured and sustained.\n\nThe Celestial Officials [天司] and the Earthly Bureaus [地府],\nThe lunar attendants [月职幽僚] and the mountain streams [岳渎山川],\nThe divine and sacred [神明] now order their ranks—\nPromoting the Dao/Way’s winds [道风] and aiding transformation,\nDispelling malevolent *qi* [邪沴] to bring peace to the people.\n\nMay the sovereign wish that heaven and earth follow their proper rhythms,\nAnd the four seasons thus be perfected;\nMay yin and yang be in harmony,\nAnd all things flourish accordingly.\n\nThe gentle wind and the rain of the *kǎn* [坎] hexagram\nShall always bring deep and ample nourishment to the fields;\nThe droughts of *xùn* [旱魃] and water demons [水妖]\nShall never encroach upon the allotted domains.\n\nMalevolent ghosts [鬼邪] shall perish in brilliance,\nAnd epidemics [时疫] dare not spread their influence;\nThe divine shall guard the gates,\nAnd strange portents naturally subside and be quelled.\n\nBeneath the vast heavens and across the boundless earth,\nA domain of longevity and springtime prosperity.\n\nWith utmost reverence and humility,\nYour subjects bow twice and present this offering.\n\nMusic shall be played.\nThe sacred titles shall be invoked again in solemn recitation.»\n\nThe officials of all ranks, including the undersigned subject [某], together with the officers and assembly at the altar, with utmost sincerity and reverence, humbly petition the Most Venerable Nine Sovereigns of the Great Luo, the Ten-Directional Most Holy Ones, the Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits, and all True Essences.\n\nWe have heard that the highest reaches ascend to the Round Luo, while the lowest extend to the Four Quarters. The boundless ranks of saints and the positioned True Immortals—some preside over the Golden Gates and Jade Palaces, others govern the Tartarus, the Tai Mountains, or the rivers and seas, while some oversee the altars and shrines. When they descend, they float upon the void and arrive; when they depart, they move without trace. Ten thousand steeds move in unison, escorting the natural array of ceremonial attendants; the Nine Phoenixes harmonize their cries, borne aloft by wind and cloud in swift passage.\n\nWe, your subjects, gaze upward in awe as Your celestial chariots ascend the Azure Expanse. Though our hearts yearn to follow, we kneel in reverence to bid You farewell.\n\nAt the sound of the *zhì* [知磬] gong, we chant the Sacred Hymns in Your honor. The Grand Lecture begins, and we focus our spirit to burn incense. The incense officials, the messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit officials—may they now cause this altar of our ritual offering to spontaneously generate the Golden Elixir and Jade-Green Pills, the hundred spirits of mushrooms and herbs, as the multitudes of True Ones gather before this incense brazier.\n\nMay we pray that the Ten-Directional Immortal Boys and Jade Maidens attend to the fragrant vapors, conveying our sincere petition of old directly to the Most High, Boundless, Supreme Dao; the Three Pure Ones, Most Holy; and before the Jade Emperor, Sovereign of the Golden Gates of the Celestial Vault.\n\nWith the Perfect Flower of the Heavenly Worthy completed, music shall be played.\n\nThe spirits are sent forth, the offerings are transformed, and all is returned to its source. The rites are concluded. Thus ends *The Complete Ritual Codes of the Dao Gate, Volume Nine*.\nThus begins *The Complete Ritual Codes of the Dao Gate, Volume Ten*.\n\n**Master Guangcheng of Mr. Du Guangting’s Compiled and Edited *Ritual of the Numinous Treasure, Great Unity, for Invoking Rain***\n\nThis ritual does not involve the Nine Sovereigns.\nFor all who take faith, only the *Jade Palace* is to be invoked.\n\nThe **Twelve Divisions of the Dao Field** are to be arranged according to the diagram of the rear altar, allowing only the finest **Twelve Divisions of superior-grade paper and writing implements**. Civil officials and commoners are not permitted to ascend the platform or participate.\n\nThis ritual is highly efficacious—**twelve seats** shall be established, and none may be slighted or made carelessly.\n\nIncense of **Descending Truth** (降真香), **Mao** (茆香), **Cedar** (沉香), **Dragon’s Spittle** (龙涎香), and **Pure Sandalwood** (清木香) is to be used; **Sandalwood** (檀香) is forbidden, as it obstructs the Celestial Precepts. Violators shall be deprived of merit.\n\n**Ritual Observance at Night**\nThe ritual proceedings ascend the platform as prescribed.\nThe **Grand Master** (都讲) leads the assembly, while each disciple pays homage to the **Preceptor** (师) in accordance with the Dao.\n\nThe **High Functionary** (高功) proclaims the **Spiritual Guards’ Mantras** (灵咒).\n**Qingyang** (青阳) radiates in its void, its

assembly, and the **Law Drum** (法鼓) is struck **twenty-four times** (二十四通).\nThe **High Functionary** (高功) ignites the furnace.\n\nInvoked are the **Supreme Three Heavens** (三天), **Primordial Origin

(某州某),\n**humble and sincere**, petition for my realm:\nSince the arrival of **spring** (阳春), the **sweet dew** (膏雨) has long been withheld.\nThe **long clouds of summer** (夏云) have lingered, and the **gentle rain** (甘雨) is delayed.\nThe **autumn clouds** (秋云) of **commercial harvest** (商秋) have gathered, yet the **auspicious rain** (嘉雨) remains absent.\n\nI now request, with my **Preceptor and all ritual officials** (临坛官众等),\nto establish the **Dao Field of the Numinous Treasure, Great Unity, for Invoking Rain** (灵宝太一祈雨道场)\nand to **dispel and scatter** (罢散) the **Twelve Divisions of the

thirst** (黎元之涸望).\n\nMy **sincere and earnest petitions** (诸诚恳) are fully recorded in the **Blue Scriptures** (青词).\nI wish to receive the **Most High’s True Essence of the Ten Directions** (十方正真生炁),\nflowing into my body, so that my **sincere supplications** (所启之诚)\nmay swiftly reach the **Supreme Court of Purple Mystery and Jade Palace** (上清紫微碧玉宫),\nthe **Great Unity Emperor of the

mighty and numinous powers** (一切威灵).\n\nI have heard that the **Five Directions’ Cloud Seals** (五方云篆) are the **first safeguards for peace in the family and the state** (保家宁国之先);\nand that the **Three Caverns’ Illuminated Precepts** (三洞明科) are the **essential means for saving beings and securing the people** (济物安民之要).\n\nThe **humans and heavens** rely upon them, both ancient and modern follow in their footsteps.\nAbove, they regulate the **celestial hosts’** (列宿) celestial movements and below, they respond to the **pleas of all living beings** (群生之沥祷).\nNow, as the **current moment and place** (当境) approach, the rains have **failed to arrive on schedule** (愆期), and the crops are **near withering** (就槁).\nThe people’s distress is **deeper than ravines and valleys** (深於沟壑), yet no

together:\nthe **Upper Purity Palace of Purple Darkness and Jade Clarity,**\nthe **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven,**\nthe **Left Celestial Dragon King within the Purple Darkness-Jade Clarity Palace,**\nthe **Right Celestial Dragon King within the Purple Darkness-Jade Clarity Palace,**\nthe **True Official of Heaven’s Harmony,**\nthe **Pure and Spirit-Bestowed True Person of the Lingbao

deities.**\n\nWe have heard that **Creation’s mercy is boundless,**\nand that **nurturing life is its supreme purpose;**\nthat **when the people have no recourse,**\nthey turn to Heaven, ever hoping for its response.**\n\nWe look upward to the **Purple Darkness of the Northern Celestial Pole,**\nascending to the **Jade Clarity of Upper Purity.**\nTo seek **auspicious dew,**\nwe lay bare our humble hearts.\n\nWe humbly pray that the **Celestial Mercy take pity,**\nspare our offense of presuming upon the Sacred,\nand deign to descend upon the **Precious Throne,**\ngraciously perceiving our sincere devotion.\nWe bow at the **Celestial Steps,**\nawaiting the arrival of the **Celestial Procession.**\n\nWe are unworthy to gaze upon Heaven,\nour pleas most urgent.\nWith utmost reverence, we kneel and bow twice.\n\n**The Celestial Response descends.**\nIncense is offered, and tea is presented.\n\nWe, **[petitioner’s name]**, along with the assembled officials,\nsincerely petition together:\nthe **Upper Purity Palace of Purple Darkness and Jade Clarity,**\nthe **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven,**\nand the **Assembled Celestial Worthies.**\n\nWe have heard that **Heaven and Earth, in their nurturing of all things,**\nare equitable in their creation;\nthat **Yin and Yang, in their governance of the four seasons,**\ndo not lack in their due measure.\n\n「Mindful of the farmers’ hardships,\nyet the **Heavenly Rain** still lags in its descent.\nThe crops are near to withering and scorching,\nwhen may we hope for the **granaries’** abundant stores to fill?\n\nDriven by poverty and desperation,\nbandits would soon run rampant;\nhomeless and adrift,\nsome might even lose their fathers and sons.\n\nYet **Yin and Yang** are ever just,\nhow could **Heaven and Earth** lack compassion?\nIf governance strays from the **Dao/Way**,\nthen officials bear their **guilt/virtue**.\n\nOnly through reflection and fear\ndo we still dare to hope for mercy.\n\nWe humbly pray that the **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven** may observe,\nand the **Assembled Celestial Worthies** descend in judgment.\nDispatch the **Six Ding Officials** to reverse the **Celestial River’s** course,\nand summon the **Four Seas’ Dragon Kings** to send forth the **Lawful Rain**.\n\nLet all be universally nourished,\nand may all **sentient beings** find great comfort.\n\nWe, **[petitioner’s name]**, along with the gathered officials,\nbow twice in deepest reverence,\noffer incense, and present tea and wine in tribute.\n\nWe raise the **Music of the Jade Purity**,\nand perform the **sacred rites**.\n\nWe have heard that faithful ministers bowing at wells\ndraw forth gushing springs from the earth,\nand filial sons dwelling in huts\nreceive sweet dew falling in their courtyards.\n\nIf one act suffices to call forth such response,\nhow much more should the cries of countless people\nmove the **Heavenly Dao’s** ear to justice—\nwhy does it alone remain deaf to the suffering of the masses?’\n\n---\n\nThe **Heavenly Dao’s** hidden workings are such that its response comes swiftly as an echo.\nHow dare we not solemnly reverence and tremble with awe before its majesty?\n\nWe humbly pray that the **Heavenly Dao’s** virtue of yielding to the people’s desires may be broadly extended,\nand its **virtue/power** of cherishing life be lavishly bestowed.\nThree years of tillage, nine years of storage—\nthus did the ancients live in harmony;\nFive days of rain, ten days of wind—\na joyful blessing upon this age.\n\nFor all who earnestly petition,\nhow dare we not present their words?\nWe solemnly prepare the **Daoist rites** and **sacred scriptures**,\nand shall dutifully proclaim them.\n\n**Scripture proclaimed.**\nAs the words state, we have already extended our petition.\n\nWith hearts pure and sincerity fervent,\nwe risk offending the **Heavenly Dao’s** discernment.\nWe have heard that when the **Lawful Rain** descends,\nthe **Heavenly Dao’s** creation knows no fixed measure of benefit;\nWhen wood is thirsty and fire is parched,\nthe abundance or scarcity of harvests follows no certain rule.\n\nThough aligned with the **cosmic order**,\none cannot escape its influence;\nYet those who earn its favor through sincerity\nmay hope to move it more easily.\n\nMoreover, food and wealth are the foundation of the people’s livelihood,\nwhile the **Heavenly Dao’s** **virtue/power** depends on human conduct.\nWe fear that governance may stray from harmony,\nand that the **Heavenly Dao’s** wrath may be revealed in ceaseless drought.\nHow dare we forget the thought of reverence and self-examination,\nor abandon our earnest prayers for refuge?\n\nWe earnestly hope that our humble devotion\nmay slightly open the depths of its mysteries.\n\nThe **Supreme Heavenly Dao**,\nthrough nurturing and sustaining all,\nfulfills its great function.\nIf it turns back on these lowly people,\nthen widows, orphans, and the solitary\nshall find their refuge.\n\nThus, the burdens of officials may be lightened—\nthis truly relies on the **Heavenly Dao’s** grace.\n\nWe, the **petitioner** and the **Daoist ritual officials**,\nwith hearts overflowing in devotion,\nbow twice in deepest reverence,\noffer incense, and present tea and wine in tribute.\n\nWe raise the **Music of the Highest Purity**,\nand perform the **sacred rites**.\n\nWe now solemnly and sincerely address the **Supreme Heavenly Dao’s** Purple Cloud Palace, the **Great One, Sovereign of the Great Heavenly Dao**, and the **Assembled High Worthies**.\n\nWe have heard that the **Dao** governs the **Three Realms**,\nand all things are encompassed under its **covering and bearing**.\nThe **Heavenly Dao’s** **seven celestial officials** oversee all life with their **illuminating presence**.\nIts mysteries are beyond naming,\nits sincerity is beyond measure.\n\nWe deeply reflect on the parched fields of a spring without rain,\na thousand miles scorched as if aflame.\nThe late plowing’s gains are lost,\nour hands bound in helplessness;\nThe **spirits of mountains and rivers** are entreated in vain,\nno response to our desperate pleas.\nWe tremble in fear—\nnowhere to turn for refuge.\n\nThus, we respectfully knock at the **Purple Celestial Court**,\nand lay bare our deepest sincerity.\n\nWe humbly pray that the **Sacred Worthies** show no delay,\nand that the **Heavenly Dao’s** transformations move swiftly.\nMay the **Great Heavenly Dao**’s court\nbeat thunderous drums to summon rain and wind,\nso that the **once-great-grandson’s** harvests\nmay flourish with millet and sorghum,\nlike the thatched halls of old.\n\nLet us sing of abundant years,\nand forever dwell in joyous lands.\n\nWe, the **petitioner** and the **Daoist ritual officials**,\nwith hearts overflowing in devotion,\nbow twice in deepest reverence,\noffer incense, and present tea and wine in tribute.\n\nWe raise the **Music of the Highest Clarity**,\nand perform the **sacred rites**.\n\nWe now solemnly and sincerely address the **Supreme Heavenly Dao’s** Purple Cloud Palace, the **Great One, Sovereign of the Great Heavenly Dao**, and the **Assembled High Worthies**.\n\nWe have heard that **Heaven** possesses great **virtue/power**,\nits essence rooted in cherishing life.\nThe people’s hearts are not always fixed—\nthey turn to joyous lands.\nIf **Heaven** does not rain, then the young shoots wither;\nif the harvest fails, then the people face hunger.\n\nWe reflect on the thousand miles scorched as if aflame,\nand pity the **Three Agricultural Classes** who cry out in distress.\nIf the year does not yet end in ruin,\nhow dare the people abandon their hidden anxieties?\n\nWe humbly pray that the **Heavenly Dao’s** awe-inspiring light\nbe tempered into boundless benevolence.\nSeizing the moment to relieve the drought,\nlet the **Lawful Rain** descend and widely bless the realm;\nSo that all may share in its grace,\nand strike the earth in song to praise the **Heavenly Dao’s** might.\n\nAll our petitions are now solemnly proclaimed.\n\n**Petition proclaimed.**\n\nThe Grand Assembly is convened, and the sacred rites are solemnly proclaimed.\nThe officials of rank, in unison, humbly and sincerely petition the **Great Unity Emperor of the Great Heaven**, the assembled **High Immortals**.\n\nWe hear that though lofty as **Mount Tai**, it yet accepts the fist-sized stone;\nthough vast as the **Cyan Sea**, it ultimately receives the finest stream.\nIf the **lotus and reeds**—humble though they be—may be offered to the gods,\nthen fasting, purification, and ritual bathing may also serve the **Emperor**.\n\nWith the **Divine Presence** graciously descending upon our invocation,\nand the **Celestial Procession** arrayed for its return,\nwe observe the rites without excess—yet thrice have we humbled ourselves in supplication.\nThe **Divine** does not dwell in fixed offerings—we pray for grace from beginning to end.\n\nGazing upward at the **Pure Sky**, we bow low in reverence and farewell.\n\nWe, the **Master of the Rite** and the **Ritual Officials**, are overwhelmed with devotion—\nwe prostrate ourselves twice, offering the **Sacrificial Wine**.\n\nThe **Chimes are struck**, and the **Hymn of Divine Conveyance** is sung.\nThe **Assembly is raised**, and the **Divine Presence is invoked with incense**.\n\nThe **High Functionary** restores the **Sacrificial Furnace**.\nThe **Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, and the **Attendant Spirit Officials of the Incense**—\nlet them now command that at the place where we have set up the **Ritual Assembly**,\n**Golden Elixir and Jade-green Immortal Treasures** spontaneously arise,\nalong with **Mushrooms, Flowers, and Hundreds of Spirits**,\nas the **Multitudes of the True Ones** gather before this **Incense Furnace**.\n\nWe pray that the **Exalted Celestial Vault** descend blessings,\nand that all lands be graced with **Enlightenment**.\nMay the **Ten Directions’ Immortal Boys and Jade Maidens** attend to the **Incense Smoke**,\nand swiftly convey our petition to the **Upper Clarity Purple Microcosm Jade Palace**,\nbefore the **Great Unity Emperor of the Great Heaven**.\n\nMay the **Precious Flower Perfected Celestial Sovereign** manifest **Abundance**.\n**Thus it is done; thus

undifferentiated, yet to be distinguished;\n**Two Principles** assign their **forms**,\n**Clarity and Turbidity** are thereby divided.\n\n「Thus, the **Dao/Way** is universally rooted in the **True Spirits**,\nAnd all things are comprehensively governed by the **Transformative Power** [*造化*].\n\nClouds march and rains descend,\nThunder roars and winds rush—\nThe heavens and earth regulate their rhythms, and the **Four Seasons** are established;\n**Yin** and **Yang** harmonize, and all beings flourish accordingly.\n\nShould one extreme be insufficient,\nThen myriad calamities will swiftly arrive.\n\nNow, for the present realm, I humbly submit:\n\n**Spring:** When the fragrant spring arrives,\nSweet dews are yet delayed,\nFearful that the **Sun Prince** [*常旸*] may command too harshly,\nAnd cause the farmer’s duties to fall out of season.\n\n**Summer:** When the ever-bright sun is at its height,\nDark clouds linger without descending,\nFearful that the **Thunderer** [*蕴隆*] may bring disaster,\nAnd that the **Rain Master** [*蕃启*] may fail to act in due time.\n\n**Autumn:** When the autumnal season begins,\nTimely rains are overdue,\nThe fields have long been parched,\nAnd the harvest fears a barren year.\n\n**Winter:** When the severe winter comes,\nAnd we pray for snow,\nAuspicious snow has yet not fallen,\nFearful that **Yin** and **Yang** may lose their order,\nAnd that plagues may arise as calamities.\n\nThus, I purify the **Sacred Altar** [*華坛*] with utmost reverence,\nAnd perform **auspicious expiation** [*吉蠲*] through incense and prayer,\nHoping that the **Essence** of sincerity may be clearly received,\nAnd that the **Grace of the Highest** [*冲贶*] may abundantly descend,\nSo that all may be blessed with overflowing favor,\nAnd the realm may achieve universal abundance and harvest.\n\nWe humbly follow the **Divine Mandate** [*科简*],\nAnd respectfully present our **fasting vows** [*斋诚*],\nWishing that you may inspect and accept them,\nAnd that our petitions may be fully answered.\nAll that we invoke with **mystic intuition** [*玄感*],\nWe submit to the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless** [*至真无极大道*] **before the Highest Sovereign**.\n\n**Chanting the Directions** [*唱方*], **offering rites to the Directions** [*礼方*].\n\nWe have heard that:\nWhen the **Two Principles** [*二仪*] first divided,\nThey inscribed clouds and sealed them in the **Great Void** [*太虚*];\nWhen the **Three Caverns** [*三洞*] revealed their subtleties,\nThey bound the **net of the world** [*筌蹄*] within the **Wondrous Storehouse** [*妙蕴*].\n\nFollowing the **Sacred Patterns** [*秘范*] of the **Spirit Altar**,\nAnd gathering the **ordered rites** [*令仪*] of incense offerings,\nAll petitions made in sincerity,\nMust surely accord with **responsive harmony** [*通感*].\n\nHumbly reflecting,\nWe, your subjects, are frail in nature,\nAnd our understanding of the **Dao/Way** is shallow and indirect.\nWe have long relied upon the **Master of the Tower of Observation** [*楼观之师*],\nAnd mistakenly joined the ranks of the **Celestial Officials** [*星簪之列*].\n\nThe **pledges of our oaths** [*告盟之戒*],\nMay sometimes violate the **Golden Precepts** [*金科*];\nOur **offered sincerity** [*荐信之诚*],\nMay fail to reach the **Jade Gates** [*玉阙*].\n\nHumbly praying,\nThat the **Highest Virtue** [*高真*] may extend compassion,\nAnd the **Supreme Sage** [*上圣*] may grant benevolence,\nForgiving our accumulated transgressions,\nAnd allowing our renewed diligence to be accepted.\n\nThough the **Dao/Way** is **soundless and odorless** [*无声无臭*],\nWe dare not slacken in our **devoted contemplation** [*精思*];\nThough the **spirits** have **wings and authority** [*有翼有严*],\nWe hope to attain **responsive enlightenment** [*灵感*].\n\nNow, the **Sun Prince** [*常旸*] is somewhat excessive,\nSweet rains and auspicious snow have long been delayed,\nThe common folk lament the calamity of drought,\nAnd the **magistrates and prefects** [*郡守、令尹*] are burdened with anxious concern.\nWe strictly adhere to the **Sacred Scriptures** [*宝箓*],\nAnd solemnly invoke the **Pure Field** [*清场*].\n\nPraying that the **Ten Days** [*十日*] may align in harmony,\nAnd that **auspicious dew** [*嘉泽*] may descend in abundance;\nSo that the **Three Springs** [*三春*] may be fully nourished,\nAnd that the fields of the people may be universally moistened.\n\nIn **summer**, dark clouds bind in **active suspension** [*活套*],\nSo that the **Three Crops** [*三农*] may be fully nourished,\nAnd that the **highest plants** [*亢苗*] may be universally refreshed;\nIn **autumn**, dark clouds bind in **active suspension**,\nSo that the **Nine Harvests** [*九秋*] may be fully nourished,\nAnd that all may rejoice in a bountiful year.\n\nPraying for snow,\nThat the **Six Celestial Outpourings** [*六出*] may send the **flying snowflakes** [*飞霙*],\nAnd that **auspicious moisture** [*嘉润*] may descend in abundance;\nSo that the **Three Ascents** [*三登*] may harmonize in omens,\nAnd that we may preemptively celebrate a year of prosperity.\n\nAll beings, whether **sentient** or **insentient** [*动植*],\nAre entirely indebted to the **Transformative Power** [*造化*] for their creation and sustenance.\n\nDisasters sink into the **Nine Earths** [*九地*],\nFortunes rise from the **Ten Directions** [*十方*].\n\nWe, your subjects, with **sincere hearts** [*志心*],\nBow in **reverent homage** [*稽首*],\nAnd offer **gratitude** [*礼谢*] to the **Supreme Celestial Treasures** [*无上虚皇至真三宝*].\n\n**Chanting the Three Invocations** [*吟三启*],\n**Declaring the True Text** [*宣真文*],\nWith **three rites** [*三礼*] **raised**,\nAnd **proclaiming the Law’s rank** [*称法位*].\n\nWe, your subjects of **all ranks** [*具位*], including the **Altar Officials** [*合坛官众*] and myself,\nWith **unified sincerity** [*同诚*],\nRespectfully submit our petitions to:\nThe **Supreme Great Three Pure Ones** [*大罗无上三清*],\nThe **Supreme Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven** [*太上昊天玉皇*],\nThe **Nine Grades of Highest Virtue** [*九品高真*],\nThe **Ten Directions of Supreme Sages** [*十方上圣*],\nAll **Heavens and Earths** [*诸天诸地*],\nThe **True Scriptures and True Masters** [*真经真师*],\nThe **Perfect Celestial Symbol** [*圆穹上象*],\nThe **Heavenly Treasury of Spirits** [*天府列真*],\nThe **Earthly Abodes and Mountain Shrines** [*厚地洞宫、岳渎主宰*],\nThe **Emperor of the Eastern Tree** [*扶桑大帝*],\nThe **Divine Lord of the Bright Valley** [*旸谷神君*],\nThe **Dragon King of the Abyssal Depths** [*洞渊龙王*],\nThe **Water Emperor of the Nine Rivers** [*九江水帝*],\nThe **Twelve River Sources** [*十二河源*],\nThose who **stir clouds and bring rain**, **Thunderers and Wind Lords** [*兴云致雨、雷电风伯*],\nThe **spirits of all temples** [*诸庙神祇*],\nThe **City Deities and Community Lords** [*城隍社令*],\nThe **Three Realms** in response,\nAll **True Spirits**.\n\nWe have heard that:\nThe **Round Celestial** [*圆清*] dwells in **Purity** [*宅粹*],\nAnd the **Square Earthly** [*方厚*] stores **Essence** [*储精*];\nAll are governed by the **spirits**,\nAnd the **Transformative Power** holds the **total authority** [*总权衡*].\n\nThough there may be **auspicious or inauspicious** [*吉凶*] **categories** [*有类*],\nFortunes and calamities are **never partial** [*无私*].\n\nThus, the **Divine Mandates** [*冲科*] preserve the **rites of petition** [*请祷之文*],\nAnd the **True Teachings** [*真教*] elucidate the **patterns of expiation** [*襘禳之范*],\nAttaining **sincerity** in worship,\nAnd **responsive harmony** in sensation.\n\nNow, for the present realm,\nWe humbly submit that **sweet rains and auspicious snow** have failed to arrive on time,\nAnd that the **Sun Prince’s** excess is a **precious concern** [*珍*],\nNot to be lightly dismissed.\nWith **fasting devotion** [*斋庄*] fully observed,\nWe look upward to the **Highest Virtue**,\nAnd downward to the **Red Scriptures** [*丹款*].\n\nHumbly praying,\nThat the **prolonged darkness** [*重阴*] may follow its proper course,\nAnd that **abundant dews** [*霈泽*] may arrive in due season,\nSo that the **crops and grains** may flourish and be plentiful,\nAnd that the **people and soldiers** may attain **prosperity and ease** [*康乐*].\n\nWe, your subjects, have long followed the **Master’s instructions** [*师训*],\nAnd early donned the **True Talismans** [*真符*].\nAll incense petitions are logically beyond reproach,\nYet, when we receive the **Divine Edicts** [*词旨*],\nHow dare we not report them,\nAnd solemnly present our **Altar words and vows** [*启坛词诚*] **for proclamation** [*宣奏*]?\n\n**Proclaiming the Petition** [*宣词*].\n\nAs per the **Divine Edicts**,\nWith **utmost devotion** fully observed,\nWe now **propagate the Transformation** [*宣化*] to **follow the currents** [*承流*],\nThus **lengthening the lives** of the people and **aiding the world** [*长民辅世*].\n\nShould any **single thing** lose its **proper place** [*有失其所*],\nThen how could our **great fears** [*大惧*] find rest?\nWe fear that **punishments may be unjust**,\nAnd that the people may rise in **grievance and lamentation** [*怨嗟*].\n\nOr should the **Four Cardinal Directions** [*抚宇*] be disordered,\nAnd **affairs** become **troubled and chaotic** [*乖方*],\nWith **accumulated guilt and regret** [*烦扰积悔*],\nThe longer this persists,\nThe more the **proper sequence of time** [*时序*] may be delayed.\n\nThus, we purify the **Sacred Field** [*灵场*] with incense,\nAnd **reverently consult** the **Sacred Texts** [*稽参宝典*],\nWith **pious introspection** [*虔省躬*],\nAnd **humble self-blame** [*引咎*],\nPraying that **fortunes** may be turned and **blessings** bestowed upon the people.\n\nWe look upward to the **Highest Virtue of the Three Realms** [*三境高真*],\nAnd the **Supreme Sages of the Nine Heavens** [*九天上圣*],\nBegging forgiveness for our past actions,\nAnd permission to **renew ourselves** [*自新*],\nAdjusting and rectifying **Yin** and **Yang**,\nBalancing the **celestial decrees** [*律令*]—\nSo that the **good fields** [*良畴*] may be nourished,\nAnd that the **many crops** may grow in harmony,\nThat the **prefectures and counties** may be secure,\nAnd that the **people and soldiers** may attain **prosperity and ease**.\n\nWe, your subjects, **reverently follow** the **fasting laws** [*斋法*],\nAnd **diligently report** our petitions at every opportunity.\nHoping that our **sincere intentions** may be **responsively harmonized**,\nAnd that the **auspicious blessings** [*庬休*] may swiftly arrive,\nThat our **shadows** may follow and **echoes** may respond,\nAnd that our **wishes** may be fulfilled and **rites completed**.\n\nAt **dawn’s first light** [*明旦*],\nWith **pious sincerity** [*虔诚*] and **lawful conduct** [*依法行道*],\nWe continue to report our petitions.\n\n**Issuing our Vows** [*发愿*].\n\n**Raising the rites** [*举*],\nAnd **concentrating our spirits** [*存神*] while burning incense.\nThe **Highest Functionary** [*高功*] restores the **incense brazier**.\n\nThe **Incense Officials and Messengers** [*香官使者*],\nThe **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Officials** [*左右龙虎君*],\nAnd the **attendant spirits of incense** [*侍香诸灵官*],\nShall now command that,\nWherever we have previously **invoked the altar** and **performed the rites** [*启坛行科*],\nThere will naturally arise **golden elixir and azure jade** [*金液丹碧*],\n**Mushrooms, herbs, and myriad spirits** [*芝英百灵*],\nAnd **all spirits** will gather in assembly,\nAt this **incense brazier** before us.\n\nNow, we pray that the **Ten Directions’ celestial youths and jade maidens** [*十方仙童玉女*],\nMay **attend** the **fragrant vapors** [*兰烟*],\nAnd **transmit** our **previously offered sincerity** [*所启之诚*],\nSwiftly reaching the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless** [*至真无极大道*] **and the Highest Heaven’s Golden Gates, Jade Emperor** [*昊天至尊金阙玉皇上帝御前*].\n\n「Know the **ritual of

radiance of the sun and moon shines forth on all sides,\nThe thunderous roar of winds and peals resounds with solemn awe.\nIn harmony with the four seasons, the symbols of change are aligned,\nAnd the hundred virtues descend, bestowing blessings and auspicious signs.\n\nOnly through virtue does one draw near,\nAnd sincerity alone is the path to grace.\n\nNow, certain officials humbly submit:\nFor the disorder of yin and yang, for winds and rains,\nFor rain and snow that fail in their proper times,\nLest they harm the fields and bring sorrow to the people,\nWe reflect upon our own lack of virtue and fear the calamities\nThat may befall those who disregard the sacred.\n\nThus, we dare to offer earnest prayers and devout supplications,\nHoping for favorable responses and to receive the boundless blessings of the Dao.\nWe request the assembly of all present to join in this initial offering of incense.\nMay this incense smoke ascend high into the heavens,\nTo honor the Ten Directions’ Supreme Dao/Way Treasure, the Celestial Sovereign.\n\nWith reverence, we dedicate our bodies, our spirits, and our lives,\nProstrating ourselves to the earth,\nThat through this incense offering’s merit,\nWe may bless the current Emperor, the august Sovereign.\n\nHumbly we pray:\nMay the celestial favor be everlasting,\nAnd the sacred calendar flourish in prosperity.\nMay the foundation of His rule endure for ten thousand years,\nAnd His noble lineage thrive through a hundred generations.\nMay the five winds and ten rains never fail,\nBringing perfect harmony to all.\nMay the four quarters and myriad lands together receive\nThe enlightening transformation of His grace.\n\nNow, we offer incense again,\nAnd humbly rely upon the Supreme Virtue of the Dao/Way Treasure,\nThe Great Sage of All-Pervading Truth.\nAfter attaining the Dao, may we preserve the heavens’ eternal existence,\nAnd align ourselves with the Dao’s true essence.\n\nWith this incense offering’s merit,\nWe pray for the protection and tranquility of the prefectural magistrate\nAnd extend it to all his subordinates.\n\nHumbly we pray:\nMay the wondrous Dao/Way solidify in its blessings,\nAnd the most exalted deities aid in virtue.\nMay gentle winds stretch far and wide,\nAnd the banners of the celestial realm rest in solemn order—\nA sign of the utmost benevolence.\nMay sweet rains fall in due season,\nAnd every hundred miles resound with praise of the harmonizing Dao,\nAs though the music of the *qing* [1] were heard.\n\nMay officials be united in harmony,\nAnd the people’s afflictions all be lifted—\nNo disasters from yin and yang’s disorder,\nAnd abundant harvests for the farmer’s hopeful prayers.\n\nNow, we offer incense once more,\nAnd humbly rely upon the Supreme Virtue of the Celestial Sage,\nThe Great Sage of All-Pervading Truth.\nAfter attaining the Dao, may we preserve the heavens’ eternal existence,\nAnd align ourselves with the Dao’s true essence.\n\nWith this incense offering’s merit,\nWe pray for the protection and blessings of these people,\nAnd extend them to all within our borders.\n\nHumbly we pray:\nMay the imperial radiance descend like a torch,\nAnd the Dao’s yin [2] embrace all with its grace.\nMay all within the realm bow in obedience,\nAnd the three calamities [3] be extirpated from every village.\nMay the rains and snows be ever timely,\nAnd the seals of the land suffer no injury from drought or flood.\nMay the grains abound in harvest,\nAnd every household rejoice with the blessings of filled granaries.\n\nNow, we offer incense once more,\nAnd humbly rely upon the Supreme Virtue of the Celestial Sage,\nThe Great Sage of All-Pervading Truth.\nAfter attaining the Dao, may we preserve the heavens’ eternal existence,\nAnd align ourselves with the Dao’s true essence.\n\nWe chant the directions,\nWe repent the directions,\nWe command the demons.\n\nWe raise our voices in supplication for rain.\nThe Dao unites with the primal *qi*,\nAnd yin and yang nurture all beings.\nThe people below have committed many transgressions.\nThe Supreme Dao bestows the decree of punishment.\nWith earnest hearts and diligent morning repentance,\nWe sincerely regret our sins and seek forgiveness in the unseen.\n\nMay it be granted to shower rain and snow,\nAnd to moisten all that is without feeling.\n\nWe bow three times.\nWe again solemnly proclaim the sacred titles.\n\nThe undersigned officials, along with the assembled congregation,\nWith sincere hearts, jointly petition:\nThe Supreme Great Three Celestial Deities of the Great Dao,\nThe Most High Heavenly Jade Emperor, the Celestial Sovereign,\nThe Nine Grades of High Perfection,\nThe Ten Directions’ Supreme Sages,\nAll Celestial Deities and Celestial Lords,\nThe True Scriptures and True Masters,\nThe Round Dome’s lofty symbols,\nThe arrayed constellations and stars,\nThe boundless earth and cavernous palaces,\nThe sovereigns of mountains and marshes,\nThe Water Realm’s deep abysses,\nThe summoners of clouds and bestowers of rain,\nThe City Deities and all mighty spirits.\n\nWe hear that the Round Dome’s mysteries are profound and silent,\nAnd the divine transformations hidden in speechless grace.\nThe Great Dao is vast and unfathomable,\nAnd its primal functions operate beyond mortal control.\n\nThe shifting of yin and yang in contraction and expansion,\nThe subtle movements of heaven and earth—\nWhen pestilential *qi* invades according to season,\nThen drought arises without fail.\n\nThere are no reverent rites to uphold,\nNor sincere petitions to extend.\nYet with utmost sincerity, the celestial grace descends in splendor,\nAnd with profound devotion, the divine responds in mercy.\n\nNow, we—your humble servants—\nHumbly confess our long neglect of sweet rains,\nLest fertile fields be harmed,\nLest the year’s harvest be imperiled.\nNo auspicious dew has fallen,\nAnd we, bound by duty to this land and its people,\nHave vainly sought relief in prayer,\nEver trembling in fear and self-reproach.\n\nPerhaps there are officials who fail to heed imperial decrees,\nOr judges who err in meting out justice—\nThese accumulated transgressions\nHave brought no peace.\n\nThus, we purify the jade altar,\nAdorn it with sacred offerings,\nAnd humbly bow in repentance,\nHoping to turn misfortune into blessing.\n\nWe pray to the lofty immortals of the jade palace,\nTo the supreme sages of the celestial capital,\nTo the true sovereigns of the ten directions,\nTo the mighty spirits of the three realms—\nMay they awaken their divine hearts,\nExtend their mercy below,\nDrive away the dark void of the abyss,\nAnd command the cloud-bearers to harness the wind.\n\nLet abundant sweet dew descend,\nLet misty nourishment permeate the land.\nLet heavenly rain pour forth,\nLet blessed moisture drench the earth.\nAcross the vast thousand-li expanse,\nMay hidden plagues be dispelled;\nThrough every field of the ten thousand homes,\nMay all reap the hope of bountiful harvest.\n\nAbove, we honor the Heavenly Venerable’s boundless compassion,\nBelow, we align with our servants’ earnest supplications—\nThus, we humbly present this petition.\n\n*(The ritual is now complete.)*\nTwelve wishes are fulfilled.\nThe high priest restores the incense burner.\nThe incense officers and messengers,\nThe Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,\nAnd the attendant spirit officials—\nAt the place where we formerly ascended the altar at dawn to practice the Dao,\nGold-liquid elixir and jade-green herbs shall spontaneously

Yet, with calamities of drought and floods afflicting the land, and blessings of rain and moisture not yet bestowed, we have earnestly prayed to the lofty heavens, hoping to attain divine response. May the sacred texts be unveiled, and the subtle truths recited; may the ritual offerings be presented with fragrant devotion.\n\nWe humbly welcome the celestial procession, reverently contemplating the layered spirits. May the **Tiger-Standard and Dragon-Flag** briefly emerge from the primordial chaos, and the **cloud-chariot and crane-drawn carriage** momentarily descend to the sacred precincts. May the divine favor be manifest in its trustworthiness, and this humble ritual acknowledged—so that we may be blessed with auspicious fortune and the people universally protected.\n\nWe, the undersigned, with utmost reverence, implore the **Supreme Sovereign of the Three Realms**, the **Assembled Saints of the Three Worlds**, all hoping for boundless compassion and the illumination of divine insight.\n\nWe have heard that the **Great Ultimate encompasses the Three**, dividing the **Two Principles** in the realm of indistinctness; that the **light and pure obtain the One**, manifesting the **illuminated patterns**. Grasping the **Celestial Globe**, it governs the **Five Phases**; stirring the **winds and thunder**, it harmonizes the **Four Seasons**. It shapes all things and nurtures life—though the **True Method** bestows upon creation, yet the **common truth** knows the afflictions of **Yin and Yang**.\n\nNow, the undersigned, having long delayed the **Great Nourishment**, risk harming the flourishing life. With solemn vigilance and laboring concern, we have followed the ancient rituals of incense and prayer, sincerely seeking divine protection. May the **clouds of rain** descend abundantly, and the **snow-clouds** melt universally. With strict rites fulfilled and fragrant offerings presented, we pray for celestial favor to answer, ensuring prosperity for the people.\n\nWe, the undersigned, having received the sacred teachings and participated in the ritual, now proclaim the **sincere words of the invocation**.\n\nAs the words are proclaimed, they are deeply sincere. We look upward to the **Supreme Sovereign of the Three Realms**, the **Nine Pure Ones**, the **Illustrious Celestial Worthies of the Purple Extremity**, and the **Unrestrained Immortals of the Red Terrace**, whose radiant light descends and whose divine grace is imbibed.\n\nMay the **celestial movements align**, the **heavenly torches burn evenly**, and **Yin and Yang harmonize** while the winds and rains follow their course. May auspicious blessings arrive and malevolent influences cease. May the **thousand-li territories** forever enjoy peaceful years, and the **ten-thousand households** dwell in secure harmony. May all **creatures and plants** flourish in their growth.\n\nWe, the undersigned, with utmost sincerity, bow twice and present incense, offering wine for the **secondary tribute**. Music is played.\n\nWe now, with solemn sincerity, address the **True Saints of the Five Sacred Peaks**, the **Divine Spirits of the Four Great Waterways**, the **Spirits of Auspicious Lands**, the **Masters of Named Mountains**, who summon clouds and bring rain, and all **mighty divine beings**.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that your **vast and profound virtues** are revered across the land, whether dwelling in **cavernous palaces** or ascending as **celestial constellations**. You regulate the **winds and clouds**, distribute the **rain and dew**, and silently assist the **enlightened ruler’s governance**, aiding in the **sovereign’s administration**. All living beings universally receive your blessings.\n\nNow, the undersigned, as the responsible governor, faces the misfortune of delayed rains and prolonged drought. With earnest prayers, we seek divine response. The ritual platform is constructed, and the solemn rites completed; the fragrant offerings are presented with strict propriety. May the **masters of Yin and Yang**, the **gentle spirits of the peaks and waterways**, the **celestial officials of the Cavernous Heavens and Purple Bureaus**, and the **saints of auspicious lands and named mountains**—all in their **true and gracious forms**—descend to aid the people.\n\nMay your protection ensure peace and security, may the **fields and villages** always thrive with moisture, and the **granaries** forever overflow with abundance. Even the slightest of **plants and creatures** shall benefit from your blessings.\n\nWe, the undersigned, with deepest reverence, offer wine for the **final tribute**. Music is played.\n\nWe now, with solemn sincerity, address the **Great Emperor of the Eastern Tree (Exalted Sun)**, the **Divine Sovereign of the Bright Valley**, the **Dragon King of the Abyssal Cavern**, the **Water Emperor of the Nine Rivers**, the **Source Kings of the Four Great Waterways**, the **Rulers of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, Twelve River Sources, Streams, Valleys, and the Underworld Sovereigns**—who summon clouds and bring rain, and the **mighty spirits of the Water Realm**.\n\nYour **encompassing heavens and girdling earth** ever shine with the virtue of nourishing below. Your **profound and boundless depths** are unfathomable, your **vast and limitless expanse** endless. Though you dwell in **immortal retreat**, your **benevolent influence** is ever clear. You govern the **rising and falling of all things**, uniting **blessings and calamities** under Heaven’s will. Your responses are swift, your insights penetrate all obscurities.\n\nNow, the undersigned, with the **heavens’ blessings delayed**, feels urgent alarm. Our **sincere supplications** seek divine resonance. With **pure fasting and offerings** presented in solemn devotion, and the **ritual rites conducted with strict reverence**, may the **Four Seas’ Sacred Ones**, the **Spirits of the Hundred Valleys**, all **scaled and sheltered beings**, and the **deep mysteries of the Dragon Palaces**—temporarily leaving the **Pearl Gates**—descend to the **True Hall**.\n\nMay you partake in these humble offerings, behold our sincere prayers, and **support the vault of heaven**, universally blessing the people. May the **seasons align**, the **Five Phases harmonize**, and the **clouds bring rain**, nourishing all things without limit. May the **farmer’s toil be rewarded**, and the **lands enjoy abundant relief**.\n\nWe, the undersigned, with repeated and earnest supplication, in **awe and fear**, kneel twice and present incense. **Sacrificial libations** are poured. **Sacred hymns** are chanted, and the **ritual petitions** proclaimed.\n\nWe now, with solemn sincerity, address the **Supreme Sovereign of the Three Pure Ones**, the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**, the **Nine-Ranked High Worthies**, the **Ten-Directional Supreme Saints**, all **Heavenly Deities and Emperors**, the **True Scriptures and True Masters**, the **Circumambient Celestial Hosts**, the **Sea and Mountain Dragon Gods**, the **Responsive Beings of the Three Realms**, and all **True Spirits**.\n\nNow, the **ritual rites are complete**, the **fasting sincerity has reached its peak**, the **celestial music has ceased**, and the **immortal teachings have concluded**. The **mundane world hums with activity**, yet the **celestial chariot lingers**; the **cloudy heavens are distant**, and the **immortal abode is about to return**. May **a hundred blessings** be extended to the **abundant year**, and **three harvests** secured in the **annual cycle**.\n\nThe humble servant, along with the **officiating priests** and all others, is deeply moved by longing and the urgency of seeking grace, and thus offers this **supreme petition** with utmost reverence and trepidation. Bowing and kowtowing twice, we humbly address the **Celestial Chariot**.\n\nWe **perform the ritual** (举) to chant the **Hymn of the Departing Spirit** (送神颂).\nWe **perform the ritual** (举) to maintain the **Spirit’s Presence** (存神) and burn incense.\n\nThe **High Master** re-ignites the **altar furnace**. The **incense officials and messengers**, the **Dragon-Tiger Generals** of left and right, and all the **attendant Spirit Officials**, should now command that the humble servant’s previous **sacrificial site** spontaneously produce **Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** (金液丹碧), **herbal essences and myriad sacred beings** (芝英百灵), whereupon the **multitude of True Ones** will gather and convene at this very **incense and fire altar**.\n\nWe pray that the **Ten-Directional Celestial Youths and Jade Maidens** may attend to the **fragrant mist**, swiftly conveying the humble servant’s **earnest supplications** as previously offered, to the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless and Limitless True Sovereign** (俓御至真无极大道), the **Three Pure Ones of Highest Sanctity**, and before the **Celestial Sovereign Emperor of the Jade Vault** (昊天玉皇上帝御前).\n\nWe **know the strike of the ritual bell** (知磬举), and **chant the hymn** as we exit the hall (出堂颂).\nWe **step outside the door** (出户)

Calamities.\nMay our minds grow luminous, our actions forever aligned with the Dao/Way.\nOur petitions, when answered, shall ascend before the Most High True Boundless Dao/Way.\n\n**Recitation of the Square and Repentance Square:**\nWe, the ritual officials and assembly, with sincere hearts,\ndevote body, spirit, and fate to the Ten-Directional Boundless Dao/Way,\nthe Most High Sacred Treasure Heavenly Venerable.\nThrough this established platform and incense-burning repentance,\nwe hear that the Dao/Way follows nature—\ninnately free of wisdom or folly;\nyet through attachment to things, distinctions of sage and common arise.\nIf one dares to amend faults without hesitation,\nwhat obstacle remains to entering the Dao/Way?\n\nWe, the ritual officials of this assembly,\nfrom our earliest lives to this day,\nthough endowed with lofty wisdom, have been obscured by things;\nthough possessing the subtle body, have been clouded by desires.\nOur true nature cannot be preserved, our senses are ever disturbed—\nevil accumulates, virtue wanes.\nWe have not sincerely served our parents,\nour conduct lacks resolve,\nour clear minds are muddled in response to the world,\nour desires run wild, our emotions unchecked.\nWe have justified wrongs, concealed faults,\npursued gain at the expense of righteousness,\nwith stingy conduct betraying our teachers,\nwith narrow views slandering the True Wind.\nOur intentions have been deceitful, our paths hidden.\nWe have concealed others’ virtues and magnified their faults,\nshielded our own flaws while boasting of our strengths,\ninsulted the True Spirits, scorned our superiors,\nhumiliated others to seek victory,\nflaunted our wills, wielded unjust authority,\nand amassed the sins of the Three Karmas, the Six Roots.\nSome are recorded in the Three Officials, Nine Departments;\nothers inscribed in the Five Emperors, Four Ministries.\n\nNow, invoking the Sacred Treasure’s Ritual of the Dao/Way,\nwe establish our Pure Hall as a temporary abode,\nfacing the assembled saints to repent and atone,\nand cultivate the Mystic Dao/Way with utmost devotion.\n\nWe humbly pray that the saints extend their mercy,\nthat boundless grace encompass all,\nerasing past transgressions, severing future karmic fruit,\npurifying our bodies and restoring our untainted nature,\nawakening the hearts of all beings,\nreverently upholding the Three Treasures’ dignity—\nthat our petitions may be answered,\nthat the ritualists’ supplications shall be granted,\nthat blessings extend to all living things,\nand that grace permeates the Netherworld.\n\nWe kneel and pay homage three times to the Supreme True Three Treasures.\n\n**Translation:**\n\nWe once again proclaim our sacred rank.\nYour humble servants, [Name] and others, with utmost sincerity, now humbly petition:\n\nTo the **Dongzhen Natural Yuan Shi Tianzun** (Lord of Primordial Natural Perfection),\nTo the **Dongxuan Great Dao Yucheng Daojun** (Lord of Mysterious Dao in Jade Canopy),\nTo the **Dongshen Great Dao Hunyuan Laojun** (Lord of Mysterious Dao in Primordial Unity),\nTo the **Hao Tian Yuhuang Dadi** (Celestial Jade Emperor of the Supreme Dao),\nTo the **Nanji

oversee the **Guizi** (Spiritual Register) and attendants—\n\nWe have heard that the **Mysterious Dao** is nameless, yet vast as the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThough called **\"Great,\"** it encompasses all things in their natural course.\nAs its origin, it flows eternally without end;\nAs its fulfillment, it nurtures all things to their true nature.\nThe Emperor’s Dao is subtle and mysterious,\nThe Divine manifests the power of creation,\nBathing in the Emperor’s molding and refining,\nAnd aided by the Illuminated Spirits’ guidance.\nThus, the Two Principles possess ungoverned virtue,\nAnd the Illuminated Spirits establish their creative function.\n\nWe, the ritual officers, though born of the Emperor’s creation\nAnd nurtured by the Spirits’ transformation,\nThough our coarse nature is ground and refined,\nAnd our mediocre essence is chiseled—\nWith reverence, we follow the Grand Architect’s will,\nAnd invite the Spirits’ blessings to guide us.\nWe have long prepared the ritual hall,\nAnd now humbly address the Highest Worthies,\nAssuming the role of Daoist ritual officers,\nOffering our sincere hearts’ devotion.\n\nHow could we dare not report this with utmost sincerity?\nWith hearts pure and true, we now solemnly declare our petition.\n\n**Proclamation of Words:**\nThe words are examined with clarity, and our sincerity is evident.\nAs we focus our thoughts upon the Sacred Altar,\nOur hidden communion reaches the True Realm.\nThe incense’s fragrance ascends to the distant heart,\nAnd the celestial processions draw near in misty splendor.\nThe jewel-throned seats are arrayed in purity,\nAnd sacred lotuses bloom in the numinous domain.\n\nMay the **Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness**,\nThe **Ten Directions of Highest Worthiness**,\nThe **Great Master of Mysterious Law**,\nAnd the **Illuminated Treasure of Perfect Truth**\nLook down with compassion,\nAnd graciously respond with manifest signs.\nCommand the **Inspectors of the Divine Office**,\nThe **Guardian Spirits of Scripture**,\nThe **Local True Officials**,\nAnd the **City Deities and Community Lords**\nTo unite in harmony and virtue,\nTo guard and purify the ritual grounds,\nTo cleanse both within and without,\nAnd to dispel all malevolent forces.\n\nThus may we, your servants, attain stillness of **qi** and concentration of spirit,\nSo that our thoughts, once aroused, may swiftly ascend,\nOur petitions reach the heights,\nAnd our ritual merits be perfectly fulfilled.\n\nWith deepest awe and fear, we kneel and bow twice,\nHumbly submitting this petition.\n\n**Raising the Twelve Vows.**\n**Raising the Offering of Spirit and Incense.**\n**The High Functionary relights the incense burner.**\n\nO **Incense Officials, Messengers, Left and Right

fathom the **pages of the Dao’s Virtue**?\nThat **you oversee all beings**; how can one discuss the **governance of the unseen realms**?\n\nThe distinctions of noble and humble ranks,\nWhich bind the

Nurturing**,\nStudying the **Confucian Way** to cultivate myself,\nHoping for advancement through scholarly merit,\nWith sincere devotion and respectful intent,\nI now erect this **Sacred Altar**,\nAt the very beginning of our rites,\nAs the first act of **Communing with the True**.\n\nNow the night-watch has ended, the morning light ascends.\nThe **Celestial Path** is clear and bright—all behold the **subtle essence** of drifting mists;\nThe **Incense Altar** stands serene—together we gaze upon the **refined and solemn** presence.\nWith **feathered insignia** and **cranes’ grace**, the **scholar’s cap** stands erect like a **wild goose**,\nBearing aloft the **Divine Model**, reverently addressing the **True Spirits**,\nHoping through my **sincere and earnest longing** to fulfill my **earnest petitions**.\n\nYour servant, **Certain**, dwelling in the **Daoic Realm**, entrusting myself to the **Mysterious Stages**,\nRevealing the **tilted piety** of this turbid age,\nGuiding the **Great Benevolence** to spread far and wide.\nMoreover, presenting these **respectful words**, how dare I not submit them above?\n\nWith a heart sincere, I now **declare my petition**.\n\n**Examine

and illusory**.\n\nSince the **unseen realms** have now been contacted,\nIt is fitting that my **earnest prayers** be granted in harmony.\nPerhaps this humble form may receive the **showering blessings**,\nTo continue offering **fragrant incense**, humbly presenting **devoted reverence**.\n\nYour servant has heard:\nThere exists a **Primordial Unity**, first before Heaven and Earth;\nIts name does not fade, eternally manifest through ancient and modern times.\nThose who attest to it call it **Saint** or **Divine**,\nThose who ponder it observe its **wonder** and **boundaries**.\n\nIt encompasses the **Vast Daoic Qi**—who can discuss its **Root Source**?\nOnly through **clarity**, **tranquility**, and **spiritual purity**,\nDoes its **harmonious unity** prevail;\nAll **capacities**, **actions**, and **guardianships**,\nIn essence, return to the same **principle**.\n\nThe **flow of the Dao** depends upon\nThe **enlightenment of the individual**.\n\nAt this pure and clear dawn,\nAscending the altar to perform the Dao,\nWe invite the assembly of law to kindle the first incense strand,\nPraying that this fragrant smoke may ascend to the heavens,\nOffering devotion to the **Natural Primordial Lord of the Perfected Caverns**,\nThe **Jade Throne Lord of the Mysterious Dao**,\nThe **Lord of the Great Dao, the Venerable Old Lord of the Mixed Unity**,\nThe **Celestial Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven**,\nAnd all the **Illustrious Dao Lords**.\n\nWith body, spirit, and life surrendered,\nWe prostrate ourselves in reverence,\nAnd with this incense strand’s merit,\nWe bless the current emperor.\n\nMay his blessings be as boundless as Heaven,\nHis virtue ever renewed like the sun,\nHis merit saving all living beings,\nHis grace extending to all plants and creatures,\nSo that all tribes within and without submit to **Ren**,\nAnd all nations embrace the **harmonizing Dao**.\nMay the wind of **Mixed Unity’s purity** spread,\nAnd the **Great Dao’s harmonious transformation** flourish,\nWith the virtuous ascending to office,\nAnd the wicked vanishing into obscurity.\n\nNow, through this incense offering,\nWe take refuge in the **Great Saintly Perfected Ones’ supreme virtue**.\nAfter attaining the Dao,\nWe preserve Heaven’s eternal life,\nAnd align with the **True and Perfect Way**.\n\nWe have heard:\nThe **Thirty-Six Divisions of Mysterious Speech** transcend the mundane and establish the Dao;\nThe **Infinite Billions of Victorious Treatises** transcend desire and reveal the True.\nThey illuminate the **Celestial Scriptures of the Constellation**,\nUnfold the **River-Luo diagrams**,\nExplain the **unspeakable principles**,\nExhaust the **limitless depths**,\nOpen the **Dao’s Triple Mystery**,\nAnd proclaim the **multitude of wonders**.\nThey unfold the **Mixed Unity’s secrets**,\nAnd reveal the **Sages’ divine hearts**.\n\nAt this auspicious moment,\nHow could we forget repaying our roots?\n\nAt this pure and clear dawn,\nAscending the altar to perform the Dao,\nWe invite the assembly of law to kindle the second incense strand,\nPraying that this fragrant smoke may ascend to the heavens,\nOffering devotion to the **Three Supreme Lords of the Jade Emperor**,\nThe **High Perfected Ones who expound the Law**.\n\nWith body, spirit, and life surrendered,\nWe prostrate ourselves in reverence,\nAnd with this incense strand’s merit,\nWe dedicate it to the **certain family’s Nine Mysterious, Seven Ancestral ritual officials**,\nAnd to the **lingering spirits and lost souls**.\n\nMay sins be purged and the **Red Cliff’s path** opened to salvation;\nMay we transcend the Dao’s shores and wander freely at the **Xian’s Gate**.\nMay blessings flow endlessly,\nAnd virtuous fragrance blaze brightly,\nSo that living kin may share in these joys.\nMay the **Black Register’s guilt be erased**,\nAnd the **Green Tablet’s lifespan extended**,\nRestoring the **Dao’s innate clarity**,\nAnd securing **pure and lasting happiness**.\n\nNow, through this incense offering,\nWe take refuge in the **Great Saintly Perfected Ones’ supreme virtue**.\nAfter attaining the Dao,\nWe ascend to the **Formless Realm**,\nAnd align with the **True and Perfect Way**.\n\nWe have heard:\n**\"Mysterious, yet more mysterious—\nGreat, yet transforming—this is called Sage.\"**\nThe Dao is not the ordinary Dao;\nDivine and enlightened, it resides within humanity.\n\nFrom **One**, the **Three** emerge—\nWho contains the **Three** yet remains **One**?\nOnly through **verification’s mystery**,\nCan the **rare and wondrous winds** be fully realized.\n\nNow, donning the scholar’s cap,\nWe humbly await the **True One’s chariot**.\n\nAt this pure and clear dawn,\nAscending the altar to perform the Dao,\nWe invite the assembly of law to kindle the third incense strand,\nPraying that this fragrant smoke may ascend to the heavens,\nOffering devotion to the **Three Realms’ Supreme Lords and Saintly Assemblies**,\nThe **High Spirits who transmit the Law and save beings**.\n\nWith body, spirit, and life surrendered,\nWe prostrate ourselves in reverence,\nAnd with this incense strand’s merit,\nWe dedicate it to **certain ritual officials**,\nRegistering their names in the **Luck Ledger**,\nAnd adding their years to the **Lifespan Book**.\nBathing in the **Three Realms’ radiance**,\nAnd receiving the **Thousand Perfected Ones’ blessings**,\nMay calamities vanish and blessings abound.\n\nNow, through this incense offering,\nWe take refuge in the **Great Saintly Perfected Ones’ supreme virtue**.\nAfter attaining the Dao,\nWe eternally preserve life,\nAnd align with the **True and Perfect Way**.\n\n**Chanting the Square Array, Repenting the Square Array, Commanding Demons—**\nThree awakenings, three rites.\nReaffirming the **Law’s station**.\n\nThe **certain humble subject**, along with the assembled ritual officials,\nSolemnly and sincerely petition:\nThe **Supreme Boundless

Goodness, like water**,\nFollows all desires that arise.\n\nIn silence, we trace the **origin of descent and oversight**,\nAnd clearly perceive the **principle of mutual causation**.\n\nWe humbly reflect:\n**Loving virtue** is one of the **Five Blessings**,\nAnd **accumulating goodness** precedes **achieving renown**.\n\nLike a spring’s source or a tree’s roots,\nThus, **Heaven’s bestowal** must be nurtured by **virtue’s foundation**,\nAnd the **Bright Spirits’ guidance** must lead through **goodness’ path**.\n\nThe **certain ritual official**, from ancient times,\nHas received the Dao’s transformation,\nFortunate to bathe in the **True Wind’s influence**,\nKnowing that **virtuous deeds** open the **source of blessings**,\nAnd that **accumulating goodness** establishes **renown’s foundation**.\n\nFearful of past transgressions obstructing progress,\nAnd mindful of frail humanity’s anxieties,\nWe now invoke the **True Science of the Jade Register**,\nAnd summon the **Chariot of the Celestial Capital**,\nHoping that **Heaven may bestow wisdom**,\nAnd the **Bright Spirits illuminate our hearts**,\nSo that through **virtue**, demonic obstacles may not intrude,\nAnd through **goodness**, malevolent fates may not prevail.\nMay we enjoy the **Five Blessings of a complete body**,\nAnd fulfill our **lifelong aspiration to aid all**,\nWith the **young and old of our household** all sharing in rest,\nAnd the **entire assembly of officials and scholars** alike enjoying blessings.\n\nYet we fear that **certain ritual officials**,\nFrom past lives to this one,\nMay have committed **transgressions in the Three Realms**,\nOr **accumulated sins through the Six Senses**,\nOr remain unpardoned in the **Day Palace or Moon Bureau**,\nOr be unexcused in the **Celestial Tribunals or Earthly Offices**—\nAll we beseech for **pardon and universal grace**.\n\nMay the **East’s Green Tablet** and the **South’s Red Script** record their **accumulated goodness**,\nAnd bestow **honor and longevity’s blessings**.\nWhat we pray for may reach the heavens,\nAnd our sincerity may be fulfilled—\nSo that the **departed may escape suffering and ascend**,\nThe **living may extend their years and increase their blessings**,\nAnd all **sentient beings** may thrive in life’s fulfillment.\nAbove, we honor the **Heavenly Sage’s nurturing benevolence**,\nAnd below, we fulfill our

the **Great Unity** for all living beings,\nand applying **subtle support** to the **Buddha’s vital breath (Fan Qi)**)**.\n\nThis is not merely a weighty tradition of the **Imperial Dao/Way**,\nbut

the Petition:**\n\nUpon careful observation of the words,\none sees the **Supreme Sincerity** clearly revealed.\nThus, the **Dao/Way** is informed of this humble one’s **devotion**—\nthe utmost sincerity of their **innermost heart**.\nAnd thus, the **Auspicious Favor** is obtained—\nfor the **Dao/Way** must surely answer the **sincere wishes** of their supplication.\n\nThe fragrant vapors ascend in unbroken succession,\nas I pour forth my devout and concentrated essence,\nmy reverent contemplation deepening,\nand I humbly pray for Heaven’s luminous discernment.\n\nI have heard that **Taqing** expounds the Teachings,\nvaluing emptiness and stillness as the essence of the heart;\n**Master Ni** [Confucius] proclaimed the two principles—\nthe **Middle Way** and the **following of one’s nature**.\nHe fanned the **Mysterious Wind** beneath the pillars,\nand transmitted the **Hidden Meaning** by the **Zhou River’s banks**.\nOnly because **Heaven** has not abandoned this **Sacred Tradition**,\nhas the **Holy Dao/Way** endured unbroken, like a sash.\n\nNow this **Supreme Teaching** is truly entrusted to the **Enlightened Ruler**.\nIn this still night, ascending the altar to perform the **Dao/Way’s rites**,\nI pray that the assembled faithful may first light their incense,\nand that this fragrant smoke may rise to the heavens,\noffering reverence to:\n**Dongzhen, the

Treasures**.\nMay **blessings and prosperity** descend upon our **future descendants**,\nand **glory and honor** radiate to our **future lineage**.\nMay our **present parents and kin** alike share in

that the **Heavenly Sovereign favors none**,\nonly **the virtuous** are His recipients;\nthe **Dao/Way’s** **illumination** is **obscured** if not **practiced**,\nand it is **precious** for the **superior scholars** to **diligently follow**.\n\n「The **Golden Mouth’s** teachings,\nthe **Jade Classics’** writings firmly established,\nthus knowing that **self-perfection leads to perfecting

Enclosure shines over the Tong River,**\n**and the Imperial Lodge spreads its grace across all prefectures.**\n**Clouds march and rains descend, thunder roars and winds soar,**\n**your august spirit discerns all without remainder,**\n**your enlightened virtue flows ceaselessly without end.**\n**You nurture the vast heavens’ transformations,**\n**hold the pivot of calamity and blessing—**\n**no

Standard**\n**temporarily depart the Cavernous Palace,**\n**and the wind-driven chariot gather at the Splendid Altar.**\n\n**Overseeing our earnest devotion,**\n**your boundless grace shines forth in its purity,**\n**and we, your servants, are moved to the utmost sincerity in our reverence.**\n**We present our first libation.**\n**Music is played.**\n\n**We, the assembled officials and servants,**\n**with utmost sincerity, humbly petition the Sovereign of Seven Bends,**\n**the Master of Offerings and True Virtue,**\n**and all the numinous spirits of the congregation.**\n\n**We hear that the Dao is ever kind in aiding humanity,**\n**yet never abandons them;**\n**the Most Exalted does not dwell in unvirtue,**\n**thus virtue is ever manifest.**\n\n**With the mundane seeking the Sacred, doubt arises from its lofty distance;\nWith the Sacred responding to the mundane, it shines forth in boundless compassion.**\n\nWe humbly revere the Sovereign of Seven Bends, the Master of Offerings and True Virtue,\nWho penetrates the subtleties of the Dao, delving deep into the Sacred Realm.\nFor seven score and three generations as a Confucian sage,\nSpanning countless centuries through the ages of Han and Cloud,\nIlluminating the brilliance of words and deeds,\nStanding resolute as frost and thunder—\nSlicing through demons in an instant,\nShaking the winds and thunder with but a breath.\nHis benevolence flows like rivers, his grace permeates all;\nHe rescues the Shù people from the jaws of wolves,\nRestoring the Black Thread’s land to the domain of longevity.\nYet the ignorant remain blind, the foolish unaware.\n\nThough the Shù Mountains were carved and stones inscribed,\nTheir virtue cannot be fully recorded;\nThough the Mín River’s waters were drained to ink the deeds,\nTheir glory cannot be fully written.\n\nHow could the Most True, in responding to the common,\nAppear as but a fleeting dream of half a night,\nOr fulfill a single plea in the blink of an eye?\n\nThis is called the Dao’s exalted height—never abandoning humanity,\nAnd virtue’s grandeur—yet claiming no ownership of it.\n\nNow, we, the ritual officials, in awe of your sacred might,\nSolennly open the Splendid Altar,\nHumbly praying for your compassionate gaze to descend,\nAnd for your grace to fulfill our earnest devotion.\n\nWe submit our petition through the Minister of the Gate,\nDaring not to delay—\nOur sacred scripture shall be duly proclaimed.\n\n**Proclaim the words.**\n**Examine the scripture’s sincerity—its truth is manifest.**\n\nWith utmost sincerity and reverence,\nOur hearts pour forth in every word;\nIn solemn purity and devotion,\nWe seem to draw near to the Divine’s discernment.\n\nWe partake in this evening’s grand rites,\nBasking in the radiant fortune of auspicious light—\nAll shall be prosperous, all shall come to fruition.\n\nWe, your servants, are moved to the utmost in pious supplication,\nAnd present our second libation.\n**Music is played.**\n\nWe hear that Heaven acts without action,\nYet relies on divine might for its support;\nThe Great Dao is most wondrous,\nAnd draws upon divine virtue for its manifestation.\n\nLike the twin luminaries illuminating the heavens,\nOr the Northern Dipper as the Emperor’s voice—\nIt is the harmony of virtue and the Dao,\nUniting essence and function in perfect accord.\n\nWe revere the Sovereign of Seven Bends, the Master of Offerings and True Virtue,\nWho walks with Heaven as his companion,\nHolds the ancient Dao,\nAnd receives the Mandate from the Most High,\nCommanding the vast principles of the lower realm.\n\nWhen the wooden horses sweat in battle,\nIt reveals the Great Compassion’s courage;\nWhen the rain-soaked paths burn with fire,\nIt shows the attainment of One’s radiant spirit.\n\nNow, we in awe of your virtue and might,\nOnce more extend our sincere devotion.\n\nMay your presence come without need of summoning,\nDisplaying the boundless wonders of your workings;\nMay all desires be fulfilled,\nAligning with Heaven’s heart to bestow blessings.\n\nWe, your servants, are moved to the utmost in pious prayer,\nAnd present our final libation.\n**Music is played.**\n\nWe, the officials, in utmost sincerity, once more petition:\nThe Sovereign of Seven Bends, the Master of Offerings and True Virtue,\nThe Illustrious and Loyal King of Broad Salvation, Warlike Virtue,\nWho governs the celestial registers and attends with officials,\nAnd all the numinous spirits of the congregation.\n\nWe hear that symbols establish the hierarchy of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd the trigrams weigh the coming and going of great and small;\nNo age exists without relying on worthy talent,\nNo talent thrives without the age’s support—\nThus, the principle of mutual benefit dictates\nThat there must be those who take the lead.\n\nWe reverently behold the vast Heaven and august Sovereign,\nWho turns His gaze westward,\nEntrusting the celestial register to the True One of Seven Bends;\nIncomprehensible in thought,\nHe establishes the mighty hook for the four quarters’ virtuous.\n\nThus, in harmony with the effortless transformation,\nHe achieves the wondrous workings of yin and yang’s awe,\nSpreading joy among all beings,\nAnd opening enlightened governance across the six directions.\n\nWe, the ritual officials, reflect that our nature is dull and blunt,\nOur station low and meager—\nYet we have received the boundless grace of your favor,\nAnd been touched by your unfathomable virtue.\nThough we have long cherished the classics,\nWe have yet to attain the broad path.\nRelying on the Daoist ranks and talismans,\nWe seek to fulfill the scholar’s ambition for officialdom—\nMay the great numbers of your blessings be answered,\nAnd our humble prayers granted:\nThat the firewood of the lower stove may burn bright,\nAnd our remaining talents may flourish;\nThat the moon’s immortal osmanthus may grow anew.\n\nMay the Sacred Sovereign live long, and the four seas prosper in peace,\nHis august might tremble the nine barbarians into submission.\nLet the scholars gather in harmony, achieving the auspiciousness of advancement;\nLet the officials unite in reverence, fulfilling the rites of communication.\n\nMay all living things, great and small, be bathed in your blessings.\n\nWe, the ritual officials, may have impurities of body or mind,\nOr failings in ritual propriety—\nYet with all assembled officials and spirits,\nOur myriad faults and sins,\nWe humbly pray for your boundless compassion to descend,\nAnd grant us pardon—\nAbove, to honor the Divine’s boundless grace,\nBelow, to fulfill our collective pious devotion.\n\n**We proclaim the Twelve Wishes.**\n**We focus the spirit and burn incense.**\n\nThe High Functionary restores the censer.\nThe Incense Officials, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,\nAnd the attendant spirit officials of incense—\nLet them command that the place where I once stood in quiet night,\nAscending the altar to practice the Dao,\nShall naturally produce golden elixirs and jade-green herbs,\nHundreds of numinous plants,\nAs the spirits gather here before this censer’s flames.\n\nMay the celestial children and maidens of the ten directions\nAttend the fragrant mists,\nAnd swiftly convey my sincere petition\nTo the presence of the Most High, the Supreme Dao of Non-Extreme,\nThe Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty.\n\n**We proclaim the return of the Heavenly Sovereign’s crane and chariot.**\n\n**We focus on virtue, transform wealth, and

examinations,\nFind his **true master** and meet his **proper time**,\nPractice **righteousness** and thereby realize the **Way**.\n\nHe humbly hopes that his **ancestors of old**—\nBoth near and

a **vessel of the True**,\nWhereby its **mysteries** unfold,\nAnd its **heavenly depths** are preserved.\nTo achieve this harmony of function,\nOne must ensure **longevity’s permanence**.\n\nThe **Dao-official** receives **divine qi** from the **Great Dao**,\nAnd cultivates his **affairs** as a **scholar**.\nLike a **sprout that blossoms**,\nHe must then be worthy of **action**;\nLike a **blossom that bears fruit**,\nHe must then be capable of **fulfillment**.\n\nWith deepest prayer, he beseeches the **Worthy Ones**—\nMay they **springtime regard** him,\nMay the **Holy Saints**

realized.\n\nSince the **Ancient Worthies** decreed the **eternal patterns**,\nThey valued **diligent learning** and **entering governance**,\nNot neglecting the **ruler-subject relationship**,\nThus

are now presented,\nThe **fragrant sacrifices** prepared—\nThe **Dragon’s chariot** lingers through the **eternal night**,\nThe **cinnamon wine** ascends in **three reverent libations**.\n\nThe **Grand Music Master’s** **august spirit** descends to the **impure realm**,\nThe **Hundred Spirits’ Sovereign Ruler** pierces through to the **heart-mind**.\n\nThe humble petitioner, together with the **officiants of the Daoist ritual (jiào)** and others,\n\nIn past lives and this present existence,\nHas never yet awakened to the **Dao/Way**;\n\nThe **six senses** and **three activities**,\nLong steeped in transgressions and errors,\nEither killing and harming **sentient beings (yǒuqíng)**,\nOr encroaching upon the **common folk (shùlèi)**,\nBetraying the **true spirits

humbly extend our **repentance and purification (chànxǐ)****,\nHoping for universal **pardon and absolution (shèchú)**.\nWe pray that the **ancestral halls (Zōngmiào)** may be forever safeguarded,\nThat **arms and conflict (gāngē)**** may forever cease,\nThat the people shall be free from **epidemic afflictions (yìlì)**,\nAnd the times shall know no **deficiencies of water or

implored for **pardon and forgiveness**.\n\nWe look upward, hoping the **Highest True Ones of the Upper Realm (Shàngjiè Gāozhēn)****\nMay swiftly return to the **Jade Gates (Yáo què)**;\nAnd below, that the **ranked Saints of the mortal world (Lièshèng)****\nMay once more ascend to the **Palaces of the True Spirits (Xiān cáochú)**.\n\nMay the **radiant light (liúguāng)**** return to our ritual

who follow the Dao in their deeds, and the gates of all wonders must be sought by those who grasp the mysteries of wondrous things. In silent exploration of the ever-renewing principle, and in secret mastery of the ceaseless functions, all things flow in form, spanning heaven and coiling earth. Only the august Sovereigns of the Three Realms and the ranked Saints of the Ten Directions are vast beyond the rivers and seas, lofty beyond the mountains and peaks—yet their blessings endure through the unbroken lineage of their descendants, and their virtue is revered by all virtuous folk.\n\nThe **Taoist Official of the Ritual Hall**, [Name] of modest virtue, though unaware of his own merit, has accumulated good deeds that now shine forth. At the outset, he sought the harmony of his descendants; at the end, he prayed that this son might be forever preserved. Together, they align their forms with the Nine Qi and share their fate with the Three Primordials. The **Born Gods** respond in reverence as they do in song, and the **Minister of Fate** obeys with respect as he does with deference. They examine the month of birth and expand the functions of life, harmonizing the Six Qi at the Great Balance and opening the Eight Desolations into the Domain of Longevity. Thus may they attain enduring blessings and maintain a solemn, reverent heart.\n\nIn accordance with the Daoist rites, I now invoke the True Vehicles, praying for the prosperity of my descendants from the Sacred Axis and offering sincere devotion to the Jade Void. As the first wishes are uttered and the grand rites commence, I give thanks to Heaven and Earth for their creative grace and pray for the longevity and prosperity of my descendants. The humble servants, with utmost reverence, prostrate themselves twice and present incense. Pure tea is offered in tribute. Flowers are scattered.\n\nWith sincere hearts, we now address the **Natural Three Pure Ones of the Void**, the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**, and the ranked Saints of the Three Realms and Ten Directions.\n\nThe humble servant hears that the **Work of Transformation** secretly moves within the floating, dreamlike realms of the **Dharma Realm**, while the **Great Dao** remains hidden yet reveals its virtue of nurturing life. It divides the Three Talents to establish order and distributes the Nine Qi to form all things. All people under heaven are born through the nurturing of their parents, yet their essence connects to the **Jade Purity**, and their spirits are transformed by the **Primordial Origin** as it sows its essence and moves its spirit, universally delivering all beings.\n\nThus, reflecting inward, one finds that one’s fate is decreed by Heaven. Since the **Taoist Official of the Ritual Hall**, [Name], took his wife, no child has been born. Fearful of failing to uphold the ancestral rites and grieving that the line of sacrifice may not continue, he now humbly appeals to the High Saints, guiding and welcoming their blessings. With sincere devotion, he follows the ritual precepts and invokes the sacred altar.\n\nNow, as incense is burned, I turn my body, my spirit, and my fate toward the **Boundless Dao of the Ten Directions**, wishing to dedicate these merits to all beings, seen and unseen. May the Three Realms shine their light, and all spirits guard and protect. May they perceive this sincere red heart and illuminate it, and may the winds of the **Celestial Chariot** descend to attend. May my petition be inscribed in the Imperial heart, and may my descendants flourish eternally. The divine response shall be conveyed to the **Supreme True Boundless Dao** on high.\n\n**Chanting the Square**, **Repentance**, **Three Invocations**, **Three Offerings**. The **True Scriptures** are proclaimed. The **Law Positions** are solemnly repeated. The humble servants, [Name] and the assembled officials of the altar, with sincere hearts, now address:\n\nThe **Supreme Boundless Dao**, the **Sovereigns of the Three Realms**, the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**, the **Great Sovereign Emperor of the Hook-and-Line**, the **Great Sovereign Emperor of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure and Northern Pole**, the **Earthly Sovereign Empress Who Follows Heaven’s Law**, the **Nine Sovereign Emperors of the Divine Constellations**, the **Celestial Sovereign Emperors**, the **Celestial Sovereign Emperors of All Realms**, and all **True Spirits** who respond to invocation.\n\nThe humble servant hears that in the **Primordial Ancestral Eon**, the **Origin** gave birth to all heavens; when the **Two Complements** emerged from the womb, the vast oceans and lands were established. The seven orifices were carved from **Chaos**, and the five sacred marks were planted by the **Divine**. When the winds return, they fan the **Azure Palace** with empty song; when the mists gather, they pierce the **Purple Void** with lush brilliance. Distinguishing life and classifying beings, they open the way for all things and fulfill their functions; observing footsteps and omens, they reveal the lessons of blessing the virtuous and punishing the licentious. All transformations of things dare not ignore this heartfelt devotion.\n\nThe **Taoist Official of the Ritual Hall**, [Name], has cultivated the cause of countless eons and the Daoic nourishment of the Three Primordials. Reflecting on the aged without children—called \"lonely\"—he laments the plight of the common folk, yet knows that Heaven’s greatest virtue is to give life. Thus, he follows the ancient teachings and devotes himself to incense and offerings, humbly beseeching mercy.\n\nThough unworthy, the humble servants have been entrusted with this ritual office and now reverently perform the **Taoist Rites**. To preserve the living and restore the extinct is to rely upon Heaven’s might; to benefit all beings and nurture life is to spread the Dao’s transformations. With sincere hearts, we dare not fail to report this, and with true devotion, we now proclaim our petition.\n\nThe words are examined in detail, and the utmost sincerity is revealed. We humbly pray for Heaven’s attentive ear and its gracious, far-reaching blessings. We consider the officials of the Nine Heavens and the ministers of the Three Realms—those who record crimes and deeds, who always present their petitions in order. Both seen and unseen shall rely upon this, with nothing great or small omitted.\n\nNow, the **Taoist Official of the Ritual Hall**, [Name], has purified his spirit and devoutly observed the fasts, modeling himself after Heaven and Earth. He has erected the star altar, offered water and flowers, and taken refuge in the Dao’s treasures. He recites the **Sacred Chapters** at noon and in the pure night, presenting cloud-inscriptions to the heavens. The **Upper Saints** descend, and our highest wishes are extended. Incense is burned to demonstrate sincerity, spread throughout the Ten Directions; lamps are lit to continue their glow, illuminating the Nine Nights.\n\nIn accordance with the fast’s precepts, we now host the invocation and report it to the **Supreme Three Honored Ones**, the **Ten-Directional Saints**, the **Great True Master of the Mysterious**, the **Supervising Master of the Fast**, the **Most Sacred Treasures of the Lingbao**, and the officials of the Three Realms. May they descend to inspect and review what has been presented.\n\nWe pray that the **Attendant Spirits of the Scripture**, the **Supervising Officials of the Ministry of Punishments**, and the **True Officials of the Lands and Districts** may cooperate in heart and strength, encircling and guarding, sweeping away external forces, purifying the altar, subduing demons and spirits, and annihilating malevolent influences. Thus may we attain peace of mind and stillness of spirit, with divine responses clearly communicated. When the rites are complete, we shall continue to report, and the fast shall be fulfilled without obstruction.\n\nOn the following morning, the Dao will be enacted, and further reports shall be made. This is now declared.\n\n**The Twelve Vows** are recited. The incense burner is relit. The **Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon and Tiger Lords**, and the **Attending Spirits of the Incense** shall now cause the place where the humble servant has invoked the Dao to naturally produce **golden elixir and jade-green herbs**, **hundreds of sacred plants**, and the gathering of all True Ones before this incense burner.\n\nThe **Twelve Vows** are fulfilled. The incense burner is reignited.\n\nThe **Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon and Tiger Lords**, and the **Attending Spirits of the Incense** shall now cause the place where the humble servant has invoked the Dao to naturally produce **golden elixir and jade-green herbs**, **hundreds of sacred plants**, and the gathering of all True Ones before this incense burner.\n\n---\n\nOn this morning of purity, the Dao is enacted as prescribed. The rites are performed in full. The **Incense Officials and Messengers** solemnly offer their obeisance to the Master, invoking his presence as per the Dao.\n\nThe **Vigilant Spirit Incantations** are proclaimed: the **Green Yang Illumination** shines forth, its radiance returning the sun’s essence. The **Divine Tiger Repels Evil**, its celestial bells tolling as it soars. The **Subduing of Deceit and Annihilation of Trials** binds all ten thousand demons in form. The **Nine Mysteries Revert to the Dao**, the **Eight Wonders Subdue Spirits**. The **Thousand True Ones** inspect and verify, the **Three Elements** disperse impurities. The **Left Whistle** summons the **Central Yellow**, the **Right Drum** commands the **Six Ding**.\n\nThrough **Seven Rotations and Eight Harmonies**, they circle the **Celestial Scriptures**. The **Sacred Transformation** stands majestic, the **Great Dao** now unfolding. The **Auspicious Clouds** flow and spread, merging with the **Yellow Court of Illumination**, their essence blending with the **True Dao of the Way**.\n\nThe **Supreme Law Drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.\n\nThe **Three Sovereigns of the Highest Heaven**—**Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Three Essences**, **Supreme Daoist Lord**, and **Supreme Old Lord**—now summon from within the humble servant’s body:\n- the **Three Five Officials of Destiny**,\n- the **Left and Right Officials and Messengers**,\n- the **Left and Right Incense-Bearers**,\n- the **Postal Dragon and Mounted Officials**,\n- the **Golden Boys Attending the Incense**,\n- the **Jade Girls of Transmission and Scattering Flowers**,\n- the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**,\n- the **Direct Incense Officials of the Sun**,\neach in groups of **thirty-six**.\n\nThose who emerge are clad in **splendid robes and official attire**, their **headgear and ribbons** trailing in reverence. They open the **Mysterious Daoist Altars** to the **Local Deities and Territorial Spirits**, and to the **Divine Ones of the Realm**.\n\nNow, on this morning of purity, as the humble servant invokes the Dao, we earnestly pray that the **Supreme Dao of the Ten Directions**, the **Numinous Treasure of Illuminating Light**, may descend and flow into the servant’s body, ensuring that all supplications are swiftly conveyed to the **Supreme Dao of the Highest Heaven** and the **Celestial Sovereign of Jade Clarity**.\n\nWe request the **Proclamation of the Daoist Stations**.\n\nThe humble servant, **[Name]**, along with the **Assembled Officials at the Altar**, now presents our **sincere and united invocation** to:\n- the **Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Void and Naturalness**,\n- the **Numinous Treasure of the Jade Dawn Dao**,\n- the **Moral Teacher, Master of All Heavens**,\n- the **Celestial Sovereign of Jade Clarity, Supreme Emperor of the Highest

True Lords of the Northern Pole**,\n- the **True Lord of the Supreme Daoist Master of the Thunderous Court**,\n- the **Nine Officials of the Thunderous Court**,\n- the **True Lord of the Nine Heavens, who Records Life and Oversees Birth**,\n- the **Celestial Lord of the Nine Heavens, who Directs the Bestowal of Fortune, the Lord of the Azure Cavern**,\n- the **Divine Mother of the Nine Heavens’ Vigilant Hall**,\n- the **True Lords of the Three Heavens’ Provincial Offices, the Three Elements’ Departments, the Talismanic and Scriptural Divisions, and the Masters of Daoist Rituals**,\n- the **Three Primordial Lords of the Three Heavens’ Gate**,\n- the **Spiritual Officials of the Sacred Petitions and Proclamations**,\n- the **Five Sacred Emperors of the Five Mountains**,\n- the **Divine Officials of the Celestial Peaks, Blessed Terrains, and the Calm Abodes of Transformation**,\n- the **Primordial Daoist Master of the Original Peace**,\n- the **Assembled True Ones**,\n- the **True

and Jade Gates, the Lords of Spiritual Salvation and Abundant Grace**,\nand the **Yearly Seasonal Deities of Wind, Thunder, Rain, and the Mighty Sacred Hosts**, as well as the **City Deities and Local Shrines**, and all **True Spirits**.\n\nWe, the humble servants, hear that there exists a **Substance of Chaos**, which gave rise to the **manifested** before **Heaven and Earth**; and that there is a **Void of Independence**, which transcends even **Yin and Yang**.\n\n---\n\nThough it may be recorded without seeing its form,\nAnd though its name be unknown, it is called **Dao**.\n\nThus, the **Yang** abides in **Great Xia**,\nNurturing and fostering all things as its duty.\nThe **Heavenly Ancestor** encompasses all beings,\nAnd embraces and covers all without distinction.\n\nAll things, great and small, are entirely entrusted to its cultivation.\nWithout words, it is understood;\nThe four seasons proceed, and all things are born.\nNo malevolent *qi* can prevail—\nThe five grains ripen, and the myriad people flourish.\nThe **transformative work** depends upon it,\nAnd blessings are bestowed in due measure.\n\nThe **Temple Official** [Name], having long cultivated virtuous roots,\nHas now heard the **True Dao**.\nReflecting upon himself and acknowledging faults,\nHow dare he not reverently fear the **Celestial Above**,\nAnd observe the precepts while fasting in devotion,\nHoping to appease the **Childless**,\nThat I, the humble servant, may present this plea,\nAnd seek the **Sage’s return and reliance**,\nWith sincere words at dawn,\nDutifully declaring my intent.\n\n**Proclamation of Words:**\nAs stated in the petition, the sincerity is profound and earnest.\nWith reverence, I await the **Celestial’s gracious hearing**,\nAnd humbly beg for **merciful indulgence**.\nI pray for the **greatest of blessings**,\nThat my **long-lasting prayers** may be granted.\n\nI have heard that the *Yijing* speaks of the **Great Ultimate**,\nFrom which the **Two Principles** arise.\nGreat is the **Primordial of Heaven**,\nThe origin of all things.\nAll who dwell beneath Heaven and tread upon Earth\nNaturally balance **Yin and Yang**.\nThose who receive the **Great Dao** attain a nature of **Purity and Harmony**;\nThose who receive but little manifest as **soaring and crawling creatures**.\nThus, no thing fails to be nourished by **dew and rain**,\nAnd all sentient beings emerge from **molding and refining**.\n\nAll who rely upon this **transformative birth**—\nHow dare we forget to return and align with it?\nThough the **sunflower’s heart** be distant,\nIts sincerity still turns toward the **Sun**;\nThough the **otter’s sacrifice** be humble,\nIt still performs rites to **Heaven**.\nHow much more so for those in **humanity’s path**,\nResiding in this **transitional age**—\nWith offerings and prayers,\nWe must be **precise and singular** in devotion.\n\nThe **Temple Official** [Name], in fasting and ceremonial attire,\nChoosing this auspicious day,\nReverently obeys the **Celestial Above**,\nAnd solemnly serves the **Most High Emperor**.\nHoping the **hundred spirits** will come to witness,\nI pray that **one prayer may yield a son**,\nFulfilling my supplication,\nAnd glorifying the **transformative power**.\n\nWith this **dawn ritual**, I request the **assembly of the Law** to perform the **first incense offering**.\nMay this **incense cloud** ascend to the heavens,\nAnd offer homage to the **Supreme and Most True Dao Treasures of the Ten Directions**.\n\nWe, the servants, **surrender body, spirit, and fate**,\nProstrate ourselves in devotion,\nAnd dedicate the merit of this incense offering\nTo bless the **Current Emperor of China**.\nMay he and his **descendants for a hundred generations** live **ten thousand years**,\nWith **royal lineage secure** and **Heaven’s decree fulfilled**.\nFollowing **Jiang Yuan’s** footsteps in **military virtue**,\nNurturing the people as **Di Xin** did;\nExceeding **Di Jian’s** prayers to Heaven,\nAnd receiving the **auspicious phoenix**.\nEnhancing the **prosperity of the ancestral halls**,\nAnd fulfilling the **blessings of longevity**,\nMay this grace extend to the **Temple Official**,\nAnd flow to his **future descendants**.\n\nThus, the **ancestral halls** shall flourish like **sage and bamboo**;\n**Sincerity in harmony with Heaven** shall bring **auspicious cranes and harmonious offspring**.\nNow, with this incense offering,\nWe **return in reliance to the Great Saints of the Dao’s Most True Assembly**.\nAfter attaining the **Dao**, we shall **preserve Heaven’s eternal life**,\nAnd merge in **harmony with the True Way**.\n\nWith this **dawn ritual**, I request the **assembly of the Law** to perform the **second incense offering**.\nMay this **incense cloud** ascend to the heavens,\nAnd offer homage to the **Supreme and Most True Scriptural Treasures of the Ten Directions**.\n\nWe, the servants, **surrender body, spirit, and fate**,\nProstrate ourselves in devotion,\nAnd dedicate the merit of this incense offering\nTo the **Spirits of the State and Ancestral Temples, the Revered and Sacred Forefathers**.\n\nMay the **clan and ancestral halls** be **cared for with compassion**,\nAnd the **ancestral temples** maintained in **solemn reverence**.\nThough the **ancestors above** may be distant,\nTheir blessings extend as **nine autumns of longevity**;\nThe **glory of the lineage** shall align with **Heaven’s decree**,\nAnd **match the Emperor’s virtue without partiality**.\nDescending to the **Temple Official**,\nMay **ancestral grace** be bestowed upon his **forebears**,\nAnd may he **joyfully ascend to the Imperial Abode**,\nHis praises **resounding in the Celestial Court**;\nHis **sorrowful incense** shall **shine in the divine *qi***,\nAnd his **humble offerings** shall **bring blessings to the living**.\n\nNow, with this incense offering,\nWe **return in reliance to the Great Saints of the Scriptural Treasures’ Most True Assembly**.\nAfter attaining the **Dao**, we shall **preserve eternal life**,\nAnd merge in **harmony with the True Way**.\n\nWith this **dawn ritual**, I request the **assembly of the Law** to perform the **third incense offering**.\nMay this **incense cloud** ascend to the heavens,\nAnd offer homage to the **Supreme and Most True Master Treasures of the Ten Directions**.\n\nWe, the servants, **surrender body, spirit, and fate**,\nProstrate ourselves in devotion,\nAnd dedicate the merit of this incense offering\nTo **all distant and near, encompassing the dim and the luminous**.\n\nMay the **three luminaries** move in **harmonious order**,\nAnd the **four seas** unite in **civilization**;\nMay **floods and droughts** be forever **dissipated**,\nAnd **wars and punishments** **cease**.\nLet there be **five days of wind and ten days of rain**,\nWithout fear of **broken branches or shattered earth**;\nLet there be **ten thousand granaries and ten thousand chests**,\nWith **ease in tilling and reaping**.\nMay **one household’s blessings** extend to **all under Heaven**,\nAnd all **share in the happiness of Hua Xu**,\nAscending to the **Mystic and Wondrous**.\n\nEven the **calf of the plow-ox** shall bear **fine horns and multiply**;\nThe **old clam** shall **radiate brilliance**, its **pearls fully formed**.\nGrace shall be **equally bestowed upon all living things**,\nEach fulfilling its **natural destiny**.\n\nNow, with this incense offering,\nWe **return in reliance to the Great Saints of the Master Treasures’ Most True Assembly**.\nAfter attaining the **Dao**, we shall **permanently prosper and flourish**,\nAnd merge in **harmony with the True Way**.\n\n**Chant the Square**, **Confess the Square**, **Three Invocations**, **Three Rites**.\nReaffirm the **Law’s station**.\nThe **officiating servants** [Names],\nWith **sincere hearts**, now **humbly present our petition** to:\nThe **Supreme and Limitless Dao**,\nThe **Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms**,\nThe **Jade Emperor of Heaven**,\nThe **Responsive Deities of the Three Realms**,\nAnd **all True Spirits**.\n\nI have heard that when **disaster strikes**, one should **fear and reflect**,\nAnd **great virtue** shall **descend in guidance**.\nSeeing **goodness**, one must **follow its path**,\nAs the **Teachings of Righteousness** instruct.\n**Heaven is supreme**—\n**Repentance must come first**.\nWhen **sacrificial rains return** and **winds reverse**,\n**Bright Virtue** is **manifested**.\nWhen **Mars retreats**,\nIt **aligns with virtuous speech**.\nThough it may lack **sound or scent to trace**,\nIts response is **as certain as the echo of a hollow vessel**.\n\n「Then how much more so for wicked men who fast and bathe in purification,\nYet still may **manifest reverence** before the **Supreme Emperor**;\nFor the **Noble Ones** who fear and reflect in **self-cultivation**,\nMay also **preside over sacrifices** as the eldest sons.\n\nNot only do they transform calamity into auspicious fortune,\nBut they turn hearts back toward the **Dao/Way**.\nThis **Dao/Way** is the **Supreme and Limitless Dao**,\nThe **Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms**,\nThe **Jade Emperor of Heaven**,\nThe **Responsive Deities of the Three Realms**,\nAnd **all True Spirits**.\n\nI, **a Daoist Official**, humbly reflect:\nSince my **past lives** until this present birth,\nMy **mind-monkeys** have galloped wild,\nMy **heart-demons** have raged unrestrained,\nShaming **Heaven and Earth**,\nDefaming **sages and teachers**,\nDisobeying my **two parents**,\nSevering ties with my **nine clans**.\nI have **forgotten filial piety**, neglected rites—\nSometimes **not venerating** my **ancestors**;\nOr **abandoning children**, **destroying fetuses**,\nLong ago **inflicting harm** upon my own **kin**.\n\nWith **treacherous deceit**, I **offend superiors**,\nConceal the **virtuous**, harm the **able**,\nGleefully **corrupt** without restraint,\n**Hoarding grain** while ignoring the people’s suffering.\nIf **profit** lies at the **tip of a needle**,\nI **privately covet** **honor and wealth** in **land monopolies**;\nI **rejoice in disaster**, **delight in others’ ruin**,\n**Arbitrarily severing** the **sacrifices of rival sects**;\n**Exploiting orphans**, **ravaging graves**,\n**Cunningly expanding** my own **fields and gardens**.\n\nI **lack compassion**—\nMy deeds are those of the **tyrant and oppressor**.\n\nOr I **burn mountains**, **exhaust marshes**,\n**Boil silkworms**, **overturn nests**,\n**Wrongfully harming** **all living beings**,\nYet **unfulfilled** my **past karmic debts**,\n**Bringing ruin upon myself**,\nAnd thus **offending the Divine**.\n\nOr as a **subject**, I **fail in loyalty**,\n**Condemning men to death** under false pretenses.\nI **exhaust the people**, **disturb the masses**,\nBecoming the **chief of calamity** in an age;\nI **hold office without merit**, **feasting idly**,\n**Wasting Heaven’s work** among the **hundred officials**.\nI **fell the sacred cows** of **Mount Niu**,\n**Piercing the vast net** of **Heaven’s justice**.\n\nAll my actions—\n**None know their limits**,\nAnd if one **engages in such deeds**,\n**None shall escape ruin**,\nLeading to **licentious partners** in my home,\nAnd **extinction of my lineage**,\n**Lacking virtue and greatness**,\nMy **clan shall fall**.\n\nThese are the **precepts of the sages**,\nAnd **Heaven’s will** is **dreadful indeed**.\nThus, I **preserve sincerity**, **purify myself**,\n**Rectify my past**, **cultivate my future**,\nWith **vigilant devotion** all day long,\nAnd **trepidation** in my smallest thoughts,\n**Confessing my karmic sins**,\nAnd **humbly beseeching mercy**.\n\nI pray that the **vast and august Heaven**,\nThe **magnificent Sovereign Emperor**,\nMay **unleash the great virtue of life-giving**,\nAnd **bestow boundless compassion**,\nSo that **all may renew their hearts**,\nAnd **this humble clan** alone **may be spared**,\nIts **lineage preserved**, its **rites upheld**.\n**Nurturing and sustaining life**,\nMay we **raise noble offspring** like **lan and jade** in the courtyard;\n**To inherit and continue**,\nMay we **learn the arts** of **archery and metallurgy**,\nLike **Ji and You**—\nSo that the **Eight Dragons of the Xun Clan** may **not shame**,\nNor the **Three Phoenixes of Hedong** **be dishonored**,\nAnd may we **receive Heaven’s favor**,\n**Emulate the virtuous descendants** of the **Empress**.\n\nMy **earnest prayers** are **offered day and night**,\nAnd **prolific blessings** depend **on moral cultivation**.\nThe **lonely one in Zhao** became a **feudal lord for ten generations**,\nAnd the **meritorious in Liang** was a **prime minister for eight**;\nSome **advised their rulers** and **earned descendants** like **Zang and Sun**,\nOthers **accumulated hidden virtue** and **were trusted** like **the Bing Clan**.\n\nThough **publicly renowned** like **Zhang Tang and Yang Shen**,\nEven if **one or two** were counted,\nThough **a thousand or ten thousand** were named,\n**None would be exhaustive**—\nThese are the **hundred auspicious signs** of **doing good**,\nAnd **Heaven’s aid** comes **from a single virtue**.\n\nIf **one perseveres in difficulty** afterward,\n**Dragged by past deeds**,\nYet **reviews ancient precedents**,\n**Heaven’s warnings** remain clear.\n\nThe **Han Marquis** who **broke the law**—\nHis **clan perished** in **four or five generations**, leaving **no survivors**.\n**Yu Xu** who **harbored many grudges**—\nHis **lineage died out** in **twenty years**, **not passing a single mouth**.\n\nSome **schemed treacherously** and **overthrew their rulers**,\nOthers **plotted to destroy** the **Three Dynasties** and **ruin their clans**.\nEven if **one receives the jade seal** and **falls into disgrace**,\n**Evil retribution** shall **still be incurred**;\nIf **one marries first** and **buries their parents last**,\n**How can auspicious fortune** be **guaranteed**?\n\nYet **Heaven’s condemnation** is **plainly evident**,\nEven if **other virtues** exist, **none can redeem** it.\nIf **one sees their faults** and **reflects inwardly**,\nThey shall **return to righteousness**—\n**No greater joy** than this.\n\nI, **a humble petitioner**, dare **not defy Heaven’s might**,\nBut **submit to the creative transformation**,\nAnd **pledge from this day forward**,\nUntil **future lives**,\nTo **rectify my errors** and **renew my heart**,\nAnd thus **invite auspicious fortune** and **gather blessings**.\n\n**Life and its beginnings** rely **on the interplay of Heaven and Earth**,\n**Form and completion** owe **their debt to Heaven and Earth**.\n**Early signs of good fortune** descend,\n**To comfort all beneath**,\nAnd **to reveal Heaven’s great mercy**,\nWhile **below**, my **sincere submission** is **fulfilled**—\nThus, I **humbly present** this **petition**.\n\n**Twelve Vows** are **restored**.\nThe **Incense Official and Messengers**,\nThe **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Generals**,\nAnd the **Attendant Spirits of Incense**,\nShall **command** that at my **former sites of Daoist practice**,\n**Golden elixir and emerald dew**,\n**Mushrooms and herbs of all kinds**,\nAnd **gathered True Spirits**,\nMay **naturally appear**, **converging** at this **incense burner**.\nThen shall **my karmic sins be absolved**,\nAnd **sources of blessings be expanded**.\n\nWith **devoted heart**, I **receive the Dao’s guidance**,\nAnd **shall attain the auspicious sign** of **the fish and the tortoise**;\n**Blessed by the Dao**, I **shall be born anew**,\nAnd **earn the joy** of **holding jade and pearl**.\nMy **entire household** shall **be favored**,\nAnd **all under Heaven** shall **share its glory**.\n\nNext, I **vow** that **celestial children and jade maidens** from the **Ten Directions**,\nShall **attend the fragrant incense**,\nAnd **convey my former petitions’ sincerity**,\nSwiftly **reaching the presence** of the **Supreme and Limitless Dao**,\nThe **Jade Emperor of Heaven**,\nAnd the **True Spirits of the Three Realms**.\n\n**Hymns of praise** are **offered from the hall**,\n**From the doorway**.\n\n**The Compendium of Daoist Rituals and Precepts—Volume Twenty-Six Completed**\n**Volume Twenty-Seven: The Grand Rite for Praying for Lineage**\n\nAt noon, the **Dao** is practiced. The ritual proceedings ascend the platform as prescribed.\n\nEach pays homage to the Master with sincere reverence, as the law directs.\nThe **Guardian Spirit’s** incantations are proclaimed.\n**Dan qi** and **Jiuhuo** blaze forth—\nFlames and winds surge, radiant and fierce.\nThe **Red Wheel** rolls with mighty force,\nIts light piercing the **Eight Directions**.\nIts **thundering power** envelops all,\nIts **cyclic transformations** span the **Ten Thousand Worlds**.\n**Liquid gold** cascades, **magical barriers** collapse—\nAll **demons and malevolent forces** vanish without trace.\n**Evil spirits** and **fiends** are repelled,\nThe **radiant brilliance** of the **Primordial Work** shines forth.\n**Golden talismans** summon and command—\n**Cloud-striding officers** and **Dragon-taming scribes** appear.\n**Hymns of joy** and **celebratory songs** resound,\n**Flowers of praise** scatter across the **void**.\n**Divine efficacy** runs smoothly,\nThe **Four Quarters** stand in tranquil splendor.\n\nHumbly **submitting before the Celestial Sovereign**,\nI **bow in reverence**, with **no trace of disrespect**,\nAnd **harmonize** with the **Dao’s true essence**.\n\nThe **law-drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.\n\nThe **Supreme Three Heavens’** *Xuan Yuan Shi* of the **Three Qi**,\nThe **Supreme Dao Lord** and **Supreme Old Lord**,\nAre invoked to summon forth from my body the **Three Five Functionaries**,\nThe **Left and Right Officers** and **Messengers**,\nThe **Left and Right Incense-Bearers**,\nThe **Dragon-Coursing Postmen** and **Cavalry Scribes**,\nThe **Incense-Attending Golden Boys**,\nThe **Speech-Conveying, Flower-Scattering Jade Girls**,\nThe **Five Emperors’** *Zhi Fu* talismans,\nThe **Zhi Ri** Incense Officers—\nEach **thirty-six persons** appear.\n\nThose who emerge are clad in **solemn attire and resplendent garments**,\nTheir **headdresses and sashes** adorned with trailing **ribbons**.\nThe **Mysterious Daoist Altars’** *Tudi* and **regional deities** are opened.\n\nNow, at noon, I practice the **Dao**,\nAnd **solemnly present** my **sincere petition**.\nWith **heartfelt devotion** and **unfaltering sincerity**,\nMy **vows** have already been **recorded and heard**.\nI pray that the **Supreme Dao’s** *Qi* of the **Ten Directions**,\nThe **Sacred Treasure’s** *Gui Guang* radiance,\nMay **descend and flow** into my body,\nSo that my **petition** may **swiftly reach** the **Supreme Limitless Dao**,\nAnd the **Jade Emperor of Heaven’s** *Huangdi* presence.\n\n**Invoke the sacred titles** as prescribed.\n**I, [Name],** with the **officers assembled on the platform**,\n**Together present** this **sincere petition**:\nTo the **Primordial Lord of the Void-Natural**,\nThe **Sacred Treasure Lord of the Jade Morn**,\nThe **Master of the Ten Thousands of Heavens**,\nThe **Moral Dao Lord**,\nThe **Supreme Celestial Sovereign, Jade Emperor of

kindness,\nThough silent, yet attuned to all sensations—\nSince ancient spirits and gods,\nWho rule as sovereigns over all things.\nIn times past, High Qí [高祺] sought thee with solemn reverence,\nAnd the Emperor Yáo [尧], with many sons,\nAlso relied on Huàfēng’s [华封] invocation.\nHow much more so I, a humble mortal,\nDare I neglect to offer my devout surrender?\nI now wholeheartedly pray,\nHoping the **Three Primordial** [三元] **Dao** may nurture me.\n\nRevered be the **Nine Heavens**,\nWhere Kǒng Fǔ [孔父] prayed at Níqiū [尼丘],\nAnd Shēn Fǔ [申甫] descended upon Sōngyùe [嵩岳].\nSome are born from **Yuanjīng’s** [元精] fixed essence,\nOthers reserved in the **Mǎoxiù’s** [昴宿] celestial storehouse.\nWhen **Yì Jiāng** [邑姜] dreamed of the Emperor,\nShe held a scripture in hand and called it **Yú** [虞].\nWhen **Yān Gū** [燕姑] dreamed of the orchid,\nShe made **Shēn Yǔ** [申甫] proclaim himself **\"Heaven’s Decree\"** [称天] and bestow it upon her.\nNone can escape the **Dao’s** influence in **transformation** [造化],\nYet still achieve fulfillment in their **birth and growth** [生成].\n\nI, the **Ritual Official** [醮官],\nHumbly reflect:\nMy virtues are shallow, my deeds meager,\nGuilt and misfortune have piled high.\nI have strayed after profit, am filled with grievances,\nAnd though **virtue’s dwelling** [仁宅] stands open, I do not reside there.\nI have incurred Heaven’s wrath,\nAnd now face the trials of my descendants.\nI fear that one day I may perish before dawn’s dew,\nLeaving my **Nine Springs Ancestral Domain** [九原] in shame before the **ancestral spirits** [先灵].\nI behold only my fading shadow,\nA fragile thread that may not break.\nWith age, I am dishonored in **Jiàng Xiàn’s** [绛县] muddy depths,\nLike the **Ghost’s Weeping** [鬼哭] at **Ruò** [若敖],\nI am near exhaustion in my search for sustenance.\nEach day, I feel isolated and fearful,\nAnd constantly tremble in prayer to Heaven.\n\nMoreover, the **litigation of Yú’s Tomb** [虞冢讼] entangles me,\nI beg for **Great Mercy** [洪恩] to universally deliver all.\nThus, I purify my dwelling,\nAnd offer **sincere homage** [嘉诚] with utmost devotion.\n\nWe, Your **devoted servants** [臣等],\nHave received the **Golden Precepts** [金科],\nAnd partaken in the **Treasure Scrolls** [宝箓].\nWe pray for sons and descendants,\nAnd our voices echo through the **examinations of life** [监生].\nWe seek **transformation into the Dao** [仙化] and human perfection,\nAnd have heard the **supreme teachings** [上品] within the scriptures.\n\nIn accordance with our earnest sincerity,\nWe humbly petition to declare this.\n\nExamine our words with care,\nAnd witness our heartfelt devotion.\nI have heard:\n**\"Unfiliality has three forms, but the gravest is having no descendants**,\nAnd **\"the Way of birth** [生道] is not singular—\nIt originates from the **Primordial Void** [虚].\"\n\nTo emulate Heaven and Earth,\nAnd align with the **Central Harmony** [中和] that nurtures all things,\nI should first adhere within my own self,\nSo that I may resonate with the **spirits of all** [万灵].\n\nWith **incense offerings** [荐芯芬] and **devout prayers** [祈盻蠁],\nI invoke the **Ninefold Celestial Hierarchy** [九重金格],\nAnd deliver the **Sacred Dao’s** [灵宝] secret words.\nAt the **Threefold Jade Platforms** [三级瑶坛],\nI summon the **multitudes of True Ones** [众真] to the **Pearl Hall** [珠馆].\nThe **Eightfold Cloud Seals** [八天云篆] of the heavens\nAre set to pacify the **Nine Palaces** [九宫],\nAnd the **Two Celestial Poles’** [两极] stars\nShine brightly, connecting the **Five Battlements** [五斗].\n\nI pour forth my **sincere

[陛下].\n\nHumbly we wish:\nFor the **Celestial Sphere** [璇玑] to regulate in harmony,\nAnd the **Tortoise and Tripod** [龟鼎] to bring **peaceful tranquility** [燕宁].\nMay all **disasters and omens** [灾异] cease to be recorded,\nAnd **demonic influences** [妖氛] be forever dispelled.\nMay the **Dragon Palaces** [龙楼] and **Crane Forbiddances** [鹤禁]\nContinue to radiate **august brilliance** [重明].\nMay the **Hall of Painted Portraits** [甲观画堂] be filled with **honeyed blessings** [含饴].\nMay the **Hundred Sons** [百子] harmonize their **prayers of prosperity** [协螽斯],\nAnd the **Six Palaces** [六宫] sing the

wish:\nFor **Heaven’s Mercy** [天慈] to forgive and pardon,\nAnd for the **Dao’s Qi** [道气] to spread and flourish.\nMay we be **extracted from suffering** [拔苦] and **cleansed of offenses** [除愆],\nAnd may all **grievances and disputes** [冤对] be resolved.\nWe summon the **Nine Abysses** [九幽] and the **curved springs** [泉曲],\nAnd hasten to the **Vermilion Lingering Court** [朱陵], where **flaming trials** [流火] await.\nMay we receive the **flaming birth** [生方] and **roam freely in the Celestial Realm** [逍遥仙界],\nSevering **evil roots** [恶根] and **cutting off their destruction** [断灭],\nSo that our **fetal destiny** [胎注] may be **relieved and absolved** [蠲除].\nThus, we may avoid **untimely death** [夭横],\nAnd forever preserve the **blessing of continuous prosperity** [绵长].\n\nNow, we burn this incense,\nAnd surrender ourselves to the **Supreme Scripture-Treasures** [无上经宝] of the **Great Holy Multitudes** [大圣众],\nThe **True Ones’** [至真] **virtue** [德].\nAfter attaining the **Dao**

Essences**.\n\nWe have heard that the **Heavenly Dao values life**,\nand the **Mystic Gate universally saves**.\nAbove, there is no **return to the Original Ancestors**,\nfor the **Azure Realm** is the **Heaven of the Native People**;\nnearby, within our own bodies,\n**Primordial Beginning** resides above the **muddy sphere**.\nThe **Five Phases** are examined together,\nand the **Seven Deities** share the same category.\nThus, the **Dao generates One**,\nOne generates Two,\nTwo generates Three,\nThree generates the **Ten Thousand Things**—\nthe **source of the womb’s vital breath**;\nwhile **humanity follows Earth**,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nand the Dao follows **Spontaneous Nature**—\nthe **foundation of form and appearance**.\n\nThe

secretly note the ranks of those who pray.\n\n「Thus, I, [Your Name], have repeatedly submitted humble petitions in earnest, seeking to enrich humanity.\n\nAt the **jewel-strewn banquets** and **jade platforms** of the **Sacred Daoist Altars**,\nI reverently offer my wholehearted devotion;\nWith **cloud-chariots** and **wind-horses**,\nI await the **ascended steps** of the **Celestial Journey**.\n\nI present **sacrifices to the **Mining Spirits****, offering sincerity to honor them,\nAnd may the **Guardian Spirits** hear my prayers and bestow blessings in return.\n\nI humbly pray that the **Five-Colored Clouds** may dissolve and vanish,\nThat all **immortal spirits** may ascend to the **Eon-Peaks**,\nAnd that I may **assist the myriad immortals**,\nEver enjoying the **offerings of the **Sacred Daoist Altars****.\n\nMay the **endless virtues** of the **Dao** flow forth,\nAnd blessings extend to all under heaven.\n\nI, [Your Name], along with the **officiating officials**,\nAm deeply moved by the **supreme reverence** of our devotion—\nWe kneel twice, gazing toward the **Celestial Clouds**,\nAnd respectfully welcome the **Great Procession** of the **Holy**.\n\nMay the **Holy One descend**,\nAnd first receive our **sacrificial offerings**,\nThen bless us with **scattered flowers**.\n\nI, [Your Name], with utmost sincerity, now declare:\nThe **Primordial Natural Sovereign of the **Dao’s Beginning****,\nThe **Sacred Realm’s True Sovereign of the **Lingbao Dao****,\nThe **Highest Daoist Realm’s Sovereign of the **Moral Way****,\nThe **Supreme Celestial Emperor of the **Jade Sovereign****,\nAnd all **Three Realms** that respond to devotion—\nAll **mighty and sacred spirits**—\n\nI have heard that the **Great Dao** is profound and mysterious,\nAnd that the **true spirits** first established its foundation.\n\nThe **Primordial Qi** of the **Dao’s Beginning**,\nUnfurled the **cosmic diagram** at the **first eon** of the **ten billion kalpas**;\nThe **sun, moon, and stars**,\nWere exalted above the **ten thousand heavens**.\n\nTogether they **divided and governed** all things,\nAnd **jointly aided** the living in harmony.\n\nNow, I, **officiant [Your Name]**, reflect upon my **unfulfilled desires**,\nAnd my **deep anxiety** over my **offspring’s lack of prosperity**.\n\nFor **life is not solely my own**—\nIt is the **manifested form** entrusted by **Heaven and Earth**;\nYet **all things are born of the Dao**,\nAnd owe their existence to the **harmonious Qi** of **Yin and Yang**.\n\nOn this **auspicious day** of **prayer and purification**,\nI **sincerely present** my **devoted offerings**,\nHoping the **Celestial Journey** may pause,\nAnd the **jewel-wheeled chariots** may descend before my gaze.\n\nI humbly pray that the **immortal spirits** may **lower their presence**,\nAnd the **ranked saints** may **return their radiance**.\n\nThe **Six Celestial Stems** and **Three Heavenly Cycles**,\nMay each **fulfill their role** in **protecting the fetus**;\nThe **ten billion chariots** and **millions of mounted escorts**,\nMay **circulate and sustain** the **command of life**.\n\nWith **pure and fragrant offerings**,\nMay all **prosper and multiply**.\n\nI have **received the True Doctrine**,\nAnd **participated in its sacred rites**—\nThus, I now **solemnly present** my **devoted words**,\nTo be **proclaimed to the heavens**.\n\n**Proclaiming the Words**:\nI carefully examine each **sacred phrase**,\nAnd **display my utmost sincerity**.\n\nI reflect that **humans are the most refined of all living beings**,\nAnd without this refinement, we would not differ from other creatures;\nThat **children are the descendants of their parents**,\nAnd without proper lineage, there would be no **continuation of the ancestral line**.\n\nWith **unceasing sincerity**, I **present my prayers**,\nHoping the **highest heavens** may **listen with favor**.\n\nI humbly pray that the **celestial realm** may **bestow its grace**,\nAnd that the **imperial lineage** may endure **without bounds**.\n\nMay the **empress and consorts** bear **auspicious omens** of **peace and abundance**,\nAnd the **matchmaking officials** display **divine signs** of **harmony and union**.\n\nMay the **heir apparent** receive **favor and blessings**,\nAnd the **imperial records** shine with **augmented glory**.\n\nMay the **ruler and ministers** all rejoice in **enlightened virtue**,\nAnd the **barbarians and the civilized** alike follow **the Dao’s refined path**.\n\nThe **highest heavens** may **broaden their vast blessings** across the **four seas**,\nAnd the **lowest realms** may **fulfill their duty** in **protecting the lineage**.\n\nThen may blessings **reach the officiating officials**,\nAnd grace **flow to our descendants**.\n\nMay we **align with Heaven** and **align with the Emperor**,\nAnd dare to **pray for the five blessings** of the **four generations**;\nMay we **bow to the past** and **bow to the present**,\nAnd hope to **attain the prosperity** of the **ten thousand stones in one gate**.\n\nWith **devotion**, we **pray to the True Creator**,\nAnd with **humility**, we **seek the Emperor’s insight**.\n\nI, [Your Name], along with the **officiating officials**,\nAm deeply moved by our **earnest supplications**—\nWe kneel twice, **presenting incense**,\nAnd **pour libations** as **final offerings**.\n\n**Scattering flowers**.\n\nI have heard that the **primordial principles** unfold in **endless succession**,\nAnd the **three luminaries**—**sun, moon, and stars**—\nAre **established at the roots of Heaven**;\nThat the **mechanisms of creation**,\n**Govern all spirits** beneath the **Big Dipper’s handle**.\n\nThe **Five Phases** are **divided and cyclically activated**,\nAnd the **Four Seasons** are **regulated in harmony**.\n\nThe **eleven luminaries** of the **astrological system**,\nRecord **calamities and blessings** in the **celestial calendar**;\nThe **four stars and seven constellations**,\n**Influence longevity and fate** through the **fetal and animal spirits**.\n\nNow, I **solemnly entrust** the **Minister of Yin**,\nTo **devote all my sincerity**,\nAnd **pray with a pure heart**.\n\nI **reflect upon my humble lineage**,\nAnd my **years of service**—\nAttending to **imperial meals** and **offering respectful inquiries**,\nAs **direct descendant of the ancestral line**,\nI have **repeatedly presented petitions** for **purification and blessings**,\nAnd **humbly hope** for the **descent of the immortal spirits**.\n\nI pray that the **auspicious stages** may **be level and harmonious**,\nAnd that the **fire star** may **remain centered** while **cold and heat** are **properly balanced**.\n\nThe **three hundred sixty-five degrees** of the **celestial sphere**, divided into **four quarters**,\nMay all **align perfectly** with the **seasons and years**;\nThe **ten thousand and five hundred twenty** stars,\nMay **none deviate** from their **proper celestial positions**.\n\nThen may they **receive my sincere offerings**,\nAnd **transmit them to the Southern Celestial Palace**,\n**Passing on the **Sacred Daoist Talismans**** to **ensure continuity**,\nAnd **protect the **auspicious sounds**** while **securing blessings**.\n\nMay **Venus** appear in my **dreams**,\nAnd my wishes **align with the **Luminous White Star**’s **precision**;\nMay the **stars of the Big Dipper’s tail** ascend to the **heavens**,\nAnd my prayers **harmonize with the **auspicious blessings of the **Divine Rocks****.\n\nI, [Your Name], along with the **assembled officiants**,\nAm deeply moved by our **supplications for grace and command**—\nWe **pour libations** as **final offerings**.\n\n**Scattering flowers**.\n\nI, [Your Name], with **renewed sincerity**, now declare:\nAll **Heavenly Emperors** and **Highest True Ones of the **Ten Extremes****,\nMay **all gaze upon** the **great compassion**,\nAnd **pierce the mysteries** of the **radiant decrees**.\n\nI have heard that the **mountains stand firm** and the **seas are clear**,\nAnd that even without **scriptural teachings**, the **Dao** is **manifest**;\nThat the **mouth’s utterances** and **words**,\nAre all **formed on earth** and **transmitted to Heaven**.»\n\nThere are **1,520 stars**,\nAll **lying dormant** beneath the **vast expanse**—\nThen they **receive** the **sincere offerings** of our **auspicious blessings**,\n**Pouring libations** to the **Southern Celestial Palace**,\n**Transmitting** the **ritual purity** to **assume their roles**,\nAnd **safeguarding** the **humble and reverent** to **obtain good fortune**.\n\n**Longreg** enters dreams—\nMay the **auspicious talismans** **align** with the **essence of Taibai**;\n**Jiwei** ascends to Heaven—\n**Humbly** **cooperating** with the **auspicious blessings of the Divine Rocks**.\n\nI, **[Your Name]**, with the **assembled officiants**,\n**Feel unworthy** of the **utmost supplications for grace and command**—\nYet we **pour libations** as **final offerings**.\n\n**Scattering flowers**.\n\nI, **[Your Name]**, with **renewed sincerity**, now declare:\nAll **Heavenly Emperors** and **Highest True Ones of the Ten Extremes**,\n**May all gaze upon** the **great compassion**,\nAnd **pierce the mysteries** of the **radiant decrees**.\n\n---\n\nNow, the **auspicious blessings** **originate** from the **mountains and rivers**,\nAnd the **nurturing of life** **arises** from the **transformative power** of **Creation**.\nThe **emergence of a sage** in **Guandong**,\n**Already depends** on the **favorable winds** and **auspicious sounds**;\nOnly the **mountains descend the Dao**,\n**Their logic** also **draws support** from the **harmonious qi**.\n\nSome are the **many scholars** of **Ru-Ying**,\nOthers are the **literary talents** of **Bashu**—\n**Truly** they belong to the **earthly numinous**,\n**Devoutly** **relying** on the **Dao’s protective shade**.\n\nI, **[Your Name]**, a **Daoist officiant** by birth,\n**Suffer** from **illness in the womb** and **childhood afflictions**,\nAnd my **descendants are few**—\n**Fearful** of **litigious disputes** **entangling** my lineage,\nOr of **land disputes** **bringing misfortune**—\nThus I **present offerings** and **ritual provisions**,\n**Hoping** to **propitiate** the **Highest True Ones**.\n\n**Humbly** I pray:\nMay the **numinous brilliance** of the **Yangtze and Han rivers** **permeate**,\nAnd the **mountains and marshes** **channel the harmonious qi**—\n**Observe** my **sincere devotion**, even as **inconsequential** as an **ant**,\nAnd **accept** my **modest oblations**, though **impure** as the **muddy waters**.\n\nThe **seas do not raise waves**—\nThere are **nine marshes** that **do not overflow**;\nThe **Earth’s vast capacity** **nourishes all**—\nYet **three rivers** **do not all shake** in **turbulence**.\n\n**Universal salvation** of the **living and the dead**,\n**All may receive** the **blessings of virtue**,\n**Forgiving** their **offenses and transgressions**,\nAnd **granting** them **future prosperity**.\n\nWith **rituals and music, scriptures and calculations**,\nMay **prosperity flourish** within our **household**;\nWith the **four great elements** of **earth, water, fire, and wind**,\nMay **harmony be preserved** in the **four directions**.\n\nThe **Han dynasty’s officials** **illuminate** the **local communities**,\n**Shining** with the **glory of learning**;\nThe **Jin dynasty’s ministers** **support** their **descendants**,\n**Flowing** like the **Huai River’s currents**—**unbroken**.\n\nThe humble servant and the assembled officials of the fast, with deepest sincerity and fervent devotion, prostrate ourselves twice and present incense and sacred wash.\n\n**Step on the Void**—\n**Reaffirm the Dao’s station.**\n\nWith the assembled officials and the humble servant [name], we humbly unite in sincere supplication before:\n\nThe **Jade Purity Emperor, Yuan Shi Tian Zun**,\nThe **Upper Clarity Emperor, Ling Bao Tian Zun**,\nThe **Great Emperor of the Supreme Clarity, Dao De Tian Zun**,\nThe **Most High Sovereign of the Azure Sky, Jade Emperor of the Supreme**,\nAll the **Heavens, the Earths**,\nAll the **Waters, all the Mountains**,\nThe **Three Realms of responsive spirits**,\nAnd all **true and numinous essences**.\n\nWe have heard that **fasting and Daoist practice**, though following the **six seasons’ disciplines**,\nAnd **sacred wine and grand offerings**, must be **complete in the three presentations**.\n\nYet, alas, we—**mired in dust and filth**—\nHave **repeatedly offended the Celestial Hearth**,\nOffering **meager tributes of coarse grains and herbs**,\nAnd **delaying the proper rites and attendants**.\n\nWe humbly reflect: our **learning of the Dao is incomplete**, our **transgressions manifold**,\nOur **actions contrary to ritual**, our **words careless and unrefined**,\nEvery movement **inviting guilt**—\nAll we **beg for pardon and absolution**.\n\nWe only **hope that the High Immortals of the Upper Realm** may **return to their jade palaces**,\nThat the **saints of the Lower World** may **all ascend to the ranks of the Dao**,\nThat **blessings descend and grace flows**,\nThat **calamities be dispelled and hardships crossed**.\n\nMay the **Heavens restore their order**, their **echoes fading in an instant**;\nMay the **Great Ultimate’s breath** **preserve the embryonic qi** in the **Hall of Prolonged Life**.\n\nWe, the servants, **fix our gaze on the Dao’s path**, **concentrating on the boundless void**,\nYet **lament the mire of dust**—\n**Unable to retain the Sacred Footsteps**.\n\nThe humble servant and the assembled officials of the fast, with all the gathered congregation,\nWith deepest **yearning to gaze upon the Celestial Stairs** and **prostrate before the Divine Procession**,\nWith **uttermost devotion and longing**, now **humble our words**.\n\n**Reignite the furnace.**\nThe **incense officials and messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit officials of incense**—\nLet it be decreed that at the place where we have **previously established the ritual**, there shall **naturally arise golden elixirs, emerald-green herbs, and the hundred numinous essences**,\nWhere the **multitudes of true ones gather** before this **incense furnace**.\n\nMay it be our **wish that the ten-direction celestial children and jade maidens**,\n**Attend to the fragrant mists**,\nAnd **transmit our sincere supplications** directly to the **Most High, the Supreme Dao of the Non-Extreme, before the Jade Emperor of the Azure Sky**.\n\n**The Complete Collection of Daoist Rituals and Precepts, Volume 29, concludes.**\n**The Complete Collection of Daoist Rituals

(Mangzhuo),**\n**Oversees all things, illuminates the hidden and profound,**\n**Bestows blessings on the virtuous and calamity on the licentious,**\n**Assists Heaven in its transformations.**\n**Examining past dynasties, the evidence is clear:**\n\nAccording to the *Han Records on Astronomy*:\n*\"When the Upholding Star emerges, great armies rise;\nWhen it retreats, armies disperse and cease hostilities.\nIts appearance portends death, robbery, and chaos.\nIf battles are fought in its domain, victory is unattained.\"*\n\nIn the **fourth year of Emperor Jing’s

will be slain in mutual slaughter.’**\nThe Han armies exterminated them, and their state perished.\n**In the Han, the Upholding Star manifested seventeen or eighteen times—**\n**each instance heralded disaster and chaos.**\n\nIn the **second year of Zhongyuan (57 BCE) of the Later Han,**\nwhen the **Fire Star invaded the Southwest stars of Taiwei,**\nit foretold the **dismissal of high officials—**\n**the Grand Commandant and Minister of Works—**\n**for their offenses.**\nIn the **thirteenth year of Yongping (70 CE),**\nwhen it invaded *Yuche*, **great mourning ensued;**\nwhen it invaded *Zhi*, **high officials were executed.**\nLater, **King Ying of Chu and Yan Zhong** were exposed for treason and put to death.\n**In the Later Han, the Upholding Star manifested twelve times—**\n**each time, calamity struck.**\n\nFrom the **Jin, Song, Sui, and Five Dynasties onward,**\nthe records are too numerous to enumerate.\n**Such are the disasters that arise within its celestial course.**\n\nAccording to the *Five Stars’ Manifest Essence Scripture*:\n*\"When the Upholding Star shines upon a person,\ntheir lifespan is shortened, poverty ensues.\nIf they submit to fate, they may live to fifty,\nbut **wives and sons will suffer misfortune,**\nand **obstacles will multiply.**\nIf it shines upon sickness or peril,\n**wind and labor will bring affliction.**\nIf it opposes the celestial station,\n**death will come within the year.**\n**Such are the calamities it brings when it illuminates mankind.\"**\n\n**When Zhūróng and Huìlù manifest in the mortal world,**\n**fire descends from Heaven—this is called *disaster*.**\n**It arises from the accumulation of humanity’s sins.**\n**The Qin built the Alang Palace, spanning three hundred *li*,**\n**with a pavilion every five steps and a gallery every ten,**\n**exhausting every grain of wealth like dust and sand.**\n**The Chu burned it, and the flames raged for three months—**\n**this was the work of humanity.**\n\n**Mo Chu once returned to Luoyang by carriage from home.**\nBefore arriving, a woman begged for passage.\nAs they parted, she said:\n*\"I am a Heavenly Being.\nI was sent to burn the Mo family’s eastern sea estate.\nNow that I’ve borrowed your carriage,\nI cannot fail to set it ablaze.\nYou must return quickly—I will come later.\"*\nMo Chu hurried home, gathered his valuables to flee,\nand by noon, the fire blazed fiercely—**a warning to all.**\n\n**Huán Jǐng of Sìnán was told by Fèi Chángfáng:**\n*\"On the ninth day of the ninth month,\nyour home will face a fire calamity.\nQuickly depart—**\n**have each family member carry a crimson pouch of *zhūyú* berries,**\nascend a high mountain, and drink chrysanthemum wine.\nOnly then will the disaster be averted.\"*\nJǐng followed his words, leading his household to the heights.\n**Soon after returning, he saw his cattle, poultry, and dogs—**\n**all violently dead.**\n\nSubsequent generations thus retained this practice, establishing methods of exorcism and disaster warding.\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty under Emperor Huán, at the New Year’s grand assembly with his ministers, Lè Bā held wine and spat toward the southwest. The Emperor asked the reason, and he replied: *\"Shu is suffering from a fire calamity, so I am warding it off.\"* The Emperor sent envoys to investigate, and indeed, it was said that a great rain came from the northeast, carrying the scent of wine within—this was a method of salvation and relief.\n\nIn the past, when *Xīnghuǒ* (Mars) occupied the *Xīn* (Heart) constellation, corresponding to the celestial division of the State of Sòng, Duke Jing of Qi was troubled by it. He then issued three imperial edicts, and the calamity shifted three times.\n\nWhen **Liú Kūn** governed Jianglíng, a household fire broke out. Kūn knelt before the flames, begging forgiveness, and soon, the wind reversed, extinguishing it—this was a method of turning disaster.\n\nFor indeed, the coming of calamities and blessings all stem from human summoning. The Heavenly Will is benevolent and loving, and the Dao permits supplication and exorcism. Now, certain Daoist practitioners—[names omitted]—with sincere devotion, have constructed a solemn vow-fire exorcism ritual platform. They command us to proclaim the rites and regulations, to pray for blessings and ward off disasters, and to safeguard the peace of the land.\n\nAt the beginning of the platform’s establishment, if we do not first recite the ritual matters and expound the precepts and prohibitions, how then can we move the High Celestial Spirits?\n\nNow, we shall proclaim the **Ten Precepts for the Ritual Platform** to all assembled here, that each may receive and uphold them. Listen carefully:\n\n**The First Precept:** Do not disturb the body and spirit. Maintain unwavering focus—let joy, anger, sorrow, and delight not arise within. Strive for clarity and precision to commune with the Most Holy Above.\n\n**The Second Precept:** Do not treat the Sacred and True with arrogance or neglect. Hold reverence and awe, gazing upon the honored images. With sincere devotion, the Heavenly True Ones descend from the void to receive you.\n\n**The Third Precept:** Do not slight the Sacred Scriptures. Hold them with faith and weight. Study, recite, and ponder the Three Caverns’ classics, awakening to their truth and seeking the fruit of the Dao.\n\n**The Fourth Precept:** Do not slander the Dao’s teachings. Hold them with respect, spreading the Way and clarifying the Law. Save both the living and the dead, guiding all to take refuge and gain liberation.\n\n**The Fifth Precept:** Do not defile the ritual grounds. Maintain purity—bathe and fast before approaching the sacred platform. Avoid foul odors, blood, and slaughter. Keep poultry, dogs, and livestock from intruding.\n\n**The Sixth Precept:** Do not indulge the body and mind—no shouting, cursing, idle chatter, or drunken revelry. Serve the Celestial Worthies with solemnity, as before one’s sovereign and parents.\n\n**The Seventh Precept:** Do not falter in Daoist resolve. Hold firm—let no petty frustration extinguish your sincerity. Persevere in devotion, and boundless blessings shall follow.\n\n**The Eighth Precept:** Do not neglect the ritual duties. Be diligent and earnest—chant the Dao, recite the scriptures, and pay homage to the True Ones. Let your merits be complete, that both the living and the dead may share in the grace.\n\n**The Ninth Precept:** Do not err in petitioning or ritual offerings. Be precise—if reckless or careless, without proper deliberation, the Three Heavens may reject your supplications, turning blessings into misfortune. This is deeply to be feared.\n\n**The Tenth Precept:** Do not haggle over profit. Be humble and yielding—let giver and receiver both rejoice, without resentment. Do not harm your own field of merit.\n\n**These Ten Precepts—can the assembled officials uphold them?**\n*Answer:* We can uphold them.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy speaks: *\"When petitions are made and the Dao is practiced, the Four Heavenly Sovereigns ride upon flying clouds in green palanquins and eight-scenery jade carriages. Attended by True Persons and Jade Maidens bearing flower-adorned banners, they are preceded by phoenix hymns and followed by the Celestial Balance. White cranes and lions chant in unison, while incense smoke and scattered flowers drift from the void. Those who observe the rites and hear the Law shall see the Heavenly True Ones descend, and all spirits gather in homage. How then can one not exhaust the fullness of the ritual?\"*\n\nFirst, receive the Ten Precepts, then practice the Dao. Walk with measured steps, quiet the mind, and still the will. In sitting, standing, or repose, do not stray from proper form. Let the Heavenly True Ones rejoice, and your name shall be inscribed among the Upper Clarity Immortals—thus attaining the Dao’s gate within the mind.\n\nTo the ritual officials: The ritual’s solemnity is strict, its prohibitions grave. Sweep and purify the courtyard, ensuring absolute cleanliness. Discipline both inner and outer attendants—great and small—to maintain perfect silence. Do not mix mundane affairs with the Sacred, lest you offend the Celestial Spirits.\n\nIf any devout men or women wish to hear the Dao, let them bathe and fast in purity, then come to the ritual platform to pay homage and take refuge, sharing in the blessings. But if they are insolent or dismissive, unfaithful to the True—such shall surely invite retribution in the dark. Let those who partake in the ritual take heed.\n\n**The vow is sealed; the platform is closed.**\n\n*End of Volume Thirty of the Daoist Rites and Regulations Compendium*\n*Volume Thirty-One of the Daoist Rites and Regulations Compendium*\n\n**The Ritual of Invoking the Dao to Quell Disasters by Taking the Vow of Fire**\n\n**Opening the Platform and Practicing the Dao/Way**\nConduct the Daoist rites as prescribed.

In the **Summer Order**, it manifests as the Wind Lord to respond to the season; in the **Li Trigram’s domain**, it guards the Taiwei and receives its duties. When the Five Calamities arise, it acts in transformation; embodying the Ten Virtues, it brings auspicious signs. It moves through the degrees with sovereign presence, its radiance ever-shining and illuminating.\n\nI, born in the dusty world, my life inscribed in the star charts—\n**My comings and goings long bear the grace of its illumination;**\n**My actions and silences often falter in guilt.**\n\nBound by the **Fire Star’s strictures**, how much more fearful is its flaming might! Without sincere supplication, how could I avert its private terrors?\n\nThus, I lead the assembly in earnest prayer, reverently conducting the Great Ritual, reciting the *Langhan* to cross the threshold, gazing upon the Vermilion Gate in awe. All this is to atone for past transgressions and welcome blessings.\n\nWe, dwelling in the True Lodgings yet teaching among mortals, see that those who deeply hold sincerity may truly fear Heaven’s command.\n\nNow I solemnly vow across the **Three Realms**, pouring out my reverence to the Heavens, beseeching the **Supreme Celestial’s numinous response** to fulfill our collective prayers.\n\nMoreover, with heartfelt words, how could I not present them above?\n\n**Proclaim the Words.**\n\nAs the words are spoken, my sincerity is manifest.\nMay the **Celestial Hearing** discern them, and I humbly await the **Enlightened Response.**\n\nI have heard that from the **Jade Terrace and Phoenix Gate to the Precious Gardens and Dragon Mounds**, since the **Primordial Green’s inception** and the **Elemental Yellow’s revelation**, the **Golden Scripts and Jade Characters** have appeared in the Heavens, the **Emerald Tablets and Vermilion Texts** have circulated in the Thick Earth.\n\nThe **vast transformations of the Great Dao**, the **majestic functions of the Divine**, benefit all sentient beings, permeating the Boundless—thus I follow the prescribed rites, solemnly erecting the Numinous Altar, awaiting the True Sages’ arrival, hoping for their auspicious blessings.\n\nNow, at this dawn, as the ritual proceeds, I request the assembled Law-Masters to light the **first incense strand**, wishing this fragrant smoke to ascend and supply the **Most High Three Venerables and the Ten-Directional Saints.**\n\nWe, the servants, **submit body, submit spirit, submit fate**, prostrating ourselves to the ground.

A surge of **Thunderous Might** envelops all, shifting and transforming the **Ten Thousand Worlds**. **Golden Elixir** cascades, and **hostile spirits** vanish without trace. **Evil schemers and demons** are vanquished, their **Original Merit** laid bare. **Golden Talismans** summon and command, while **Cloud-Stepping Dragon Officers** and **Incense-Bearing Golden Boys** attend. **Messenger Maidens** who scatter **Jade Flowers** and **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**, along with the **Direct-Day Incense Officials**, each **thirty-six in number**, now emerge.\n\nThe **emerging ones** wear **solemn attire and radiant garments**, their **crowns and sashes** trailing **pendant plumes**. They open the **Mysterious Gate** to summon the **Earthly Sovereigns** and **Domain Spirits**. The **True Ones**.\n\nAt this **noon hour of the Way**, I humbly present my **sincere intentions**. My **true devotion** has already been recorded and heard. May the **Supreme Dao of the Unoriginated** descend its **Spiritual Treasure and Auspicious Light**, flowing into my being, so that my petitions may swiftly reach the **Most High, Supreme Dao of the Unoriginated, the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign**.\n\nI request the **recitation of the Law Position**. With the **Law Assembly** gathered, I now light the **first incense strand**. May this **Incense Cloud** ascend into the heavens, offering homage to the **Ten-Direction Dao Treasures of the Celestial Sovereigns**. I, along with the **Law Assembly**, **submit body, submit spirit, submit life**, bowing my head to the earth. With this act of lighting incense, I pray for the **merits** to bless the **current Emperor**.\n\nMay the **Jade Calendar** endure in its **Great Flood**, the **foundations of the Throne** last forever. May his **lifespan match Heaven and Earth**, his **virtue rival the sage-kings Tang and Yu**. May the **Yin-Brightness** of his **constant illumination** be ever-present, and the **Yang-Vigor** of his **great governance** extend far and wide.\n\nThe **Empress**, bearing the **Kun Virtue** of nurturing, may her **moonlike radiance** shine in harmony, assisting the **Sacred Sovereign** and bringing prosperity to the **Grand Enterprise**. May she **perpetually promote benevolence and frugality**, upholding the **Inner Precepts** within the **Nine Enclosures**; may she **forever bestow harmony and grace**, celebrating the **Root Branch** for all **ten thousand generations**.\n\n**Recite the Petition**. Examine the words carefully—they reveal my **sincerest devotion**. Heaven has no scent nor sound, yet it hears the **goodly**; the **Dao** has **sentience and nature**, and its response is never in vain. Those who seek to **move Heaven with sincerity** must rely on **uttermost devotion**; those who wish to **pray for hidden communion** must depend on **skillful invocations**.\n\nI have heard that from the **Primordial One Qi**, the **Great Transformation** of **Yin and Yang** was established. The **Dao’s vast illumination** fills the **Great Void**, and its **flying essences** nurture the **Supreme Pole**. The **Lofty Sacred Mountains** rise majestic, and the **Heavenly Stairways** stretch boundless. **Ten Thousand Spirits** guard the **Primordial Sovereign**, while the **Celestial Hosts** maintain order among the **moving multitudes**.\n\nIn ancient times, the **Blue Boys** inscribed the **Trigrams**, the **Red Emperor** cultivated the people, the **Tortoise and Dragon** bore the **River and Luo** scriptures, and the **Lynx and Phoenix** responded to the **auspicious commands** of the **Five Emperors**. The **Great Bear** governed the world, the **Golden Mother** transmitted talismans, and the **Great Ruler** presented his **full array**. The **Heavenly Symbols**, though hidden, were revealed; when **one person elevated his virtue**, the **Ten Thousand Worlds** shone in prosperity. When **one hundred rulers obeyed in harmony**, the **thousand generations** followed with reverence. All ascended to their **assigned stations**, dwelling at the **Center** to **dispense virtue**.\n\nNow, the **fragrant winds** follow the **heavenly rhythms**, the **fear of the sun’s brilliance** is timely. I revere the **unbiased radiance**, offering devotion to the **sensitive might**. On this **auspicious day**, I solemnly invoke the **Dao’s sacred standards**, hoping to **conciliate the Highest Truths** and **prolong the Emperor’s blessings**.\n\nWith the **Law Assembly** gathered, I light this incense at noon. May this **Incense Cloud** soar through the heavens, offering homage to the **Ten-Direction Dao Treasures of the Celestial Sovereigns**. I, along with the **Law Assembly**, **submit body, submit spirit, submit life**, bowing my head to the earth. With this act of lighting incense, I pray for the **merits** to bless the **current Emperor**.\n\nMay the **Jade Calendar** endure in its **Great Flood**, the **foundations of the Throne** last forever. May his **lifespan match Heaven and Earth**, his **virtue rival the sage-kings Tang and Yu**. May the **Yin-Brightness** of his **constant illumination** be ever-present, and the **Yang-Vigor** of his **great governance** extend far and wide.\n\nThe **Empress**, bearing the **Kun Virtue** of nurturing, may her **moonlike radiance** shine in harmony, assisting the **Sacred Sovereign** and bringing prosperity to the **Grand Enterprise**. May she **perpetually promote benevolence and frugality**, upholding the **Inner Precepts** within the **Nine Enclosures**; may she **forever bestow harmony and grace**, celebrating the **Root Branch** for all **ten thousand generations**.\n\nNow, the **burning of incense** is done in homage to the **Dao/Way-Embodied Great Saint**, the **Supreme Assembly of the Most True Virtue/Power**.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way**, may the **Heavenly Longevity** be preserved, and may **harmony** abide with the **True Dao/Way**. With this **midday Dao/Way practice**, the **Assemblies of the Law** are invoked, and thus we offer **three twists of incense**, hoping this **incense-cloud** may rise and ascend through the heavens, to **venerate the Celestial Lord of the Ten Directions** and the **Treasure of the Scriptures**.\n\nWe, the subjects, **surrender our bodies, our spirits, and our lives**, prostrate our heads to the earth, and with this incense-twisting **merit/power**, we **dedicate it to the nine ancestral generations of our family**, the **seven ancestral deities of divine mien**, past and present kinsfolk, and departed loved ones. May we **humbly pray** that the **Golden Scriptures decree longevity**, the **Jade Repository** present offerings to the **spirits**, the **Spiritual Treasury** be congealed in **yellow clouds**, the **Celestial Gate** give birth to **purple portals**, that **old impurities be cleansed and new vitality renewed**, ascending to the **Crimson Court**. May **blessings and benefits** be shared among **a hundred generations**, and may **abundant grace** extend to **future descendants**.\n\nNow, the **burning of incense** is done in homage to the **Scripture-Embodied Great Saint**, the **Supreme Assembly of the Most True Virtue/Power**.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way**, may one **ascend to the Formless Realm**, and may **harmony** abide with the **True Dao/Way**. With this **midday Dao/Way practice**, the **Assemblies of the Law** are invoked, and thus we offer **three twists of incense**, hoping this **incense-cloud** may rise and ascend through the heavens, to **venerate the Celestial Lord of the Ten Directions** and the **Treasure of the Teachers**.\n\nWe, the subjects, **surrender our bodies, our spirits, and our lives**, prostrate our heads to the earth, and with this incense-twisting **merit/power**, we **dedicate it to our family’s elders and young, high and low**, kinsfolk and loved ones, the **Three Officials** in purity, the **Nine Portals** in radiant clarity, the **Eight Auspicious Scenes** in flourishing form, and the **Seven Primordial Elements** in harmonized **qi**. May we **bring forth the unadulterated joy of the Pure Capital**, and **greatly match the vast felicity**; may we **fulfill the sincere intention of divine communion**, and **manifestly augment the sacred calculations**.\n\nThe Five Phases are invoked to summon the might of the **Fire Virtue/Power**,\nThe Eight Trigrams are arranged to pray for deliverance from the **Li Palace**’s trials.\nWithdrawing and abandoning this place, the **Returning Star** shall not arrive.\n\nNow, through the burning of incense, we **surrender ourselves to the Teacher-Lord’s** most exalted and true **virtue/power**.\nAfter attaining the **Dao**, we shall forever preserve **long life**, harmonizing with the **Dao’s** true essence.\n\n**Repentance**, **commanding demons**, three **invocations**, three **rites**—\nWe **reaffirm our sacred station**.\nWe, the **officer of rank** [name], along with the **officiants at the altar**, humbly and sincerely petition:\nThe **Three Pure Ones** of **Primordial Void-Naturalness**, the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**, the **Nine Sovereigns Most Exalted**, the **Ten-Directional Saints**, the **Thirty-Six Departments’** **Great Lawmaster of Mystic Center**, the **Supreme True One of Fire Virtue/Power**, the **Responsive Ones of the Three Realms**, and all **True Spirits**.\n\nWe have heard:\nThe **Celestial Luster** spreads its radiance, towering above the **Great Emptiness**;\nThe **Stars of the Dipper** encircle the **Polar Axis**, enthroned in the **Boundless Void**.\nThey **govern transformation** and **propagate essence**, **assist creation** and **disseminate virtue/power**,\nSubduing the **Ten Thousand Demons** of the **Three Realms**, arraying the **Lunar Lodges** in the **Heavens**.\nThey **proclaim the true function**, universally **delivering all beings**.\n\nThe **officiant** [name], though dwelling in the **Dao’s** shelter and ranked among humanity,\nReflects on his **single thread of insignificance**, yet still basking in the **Three Celestial’s** glow.\nYet bound by the **colored body’s** shackles, **deluded thoughts** persist unchecked,\nDrowning in the **field of profit-loss**, lost in the **realm of love-hate**.\nKnowing the **internal heat’s** peril, he must avoid the **self-immolation’s** doom,\nFearful of the **Returning Star’s** unforeseen wrath, thus **preemptively** **petitions and accuses**.\n\nThis **morning of the Valley**, we establish this **unique ritual**,\nWith **heart-intent** refined, **incense-flowers** fragrant,\nReciting the **Hidden Melodies of the Jade Scrolls**, chanting the **Empty Songs of the Jade Ledger**,\nUnwearied through endless days, hoping to reach the **High True Ones’** ears.\n\nMay the **Multitudes of True Ones** descend in response, their blessings ever-growing.\n**Plagues** shall be **cleansed before manifestation**, spirits **unable to harm**;\n**Calamities** shall be **warded before arrival**, **fire** shall **not become disaster**.\nThus, the **villages and wards** shall all be **secure**, households **preserved in prosperity**.\nAll **offenses** shall be **forever extinguished**, **ten thousand calamities** shall **not approach**,\nSo that **doorways flourish**, **lives receive deliverance**.\nMay **generations** thrive, **children and grandchildren** endure;\nThrough **aeons**, may it **last eternally**, from **this day to ancient times**.\nThe **True Root** shall **not be obscured**, **deluded thoughts** all **eradicated**.\n\n**Upper Petition for the Emperor’s** brilliance to match **Xī’s** and **Hòu’s** splendor,\nFor **Nóng** and **Huáng** to follow **Zhuó’s** footsteps,\nAscending **Ào’s Peak** in equal **fortune**, expanding the **Peng’s Sea** to **lengthen years**.\nMay the **Empress, Consorts, and Princes** **stabilize the Great Treasure**,\n**Literati and Martials** **support the Bright Foundation**.\nMay the **Two Symbols** later **radiate in harmony**, the **Three Lights** **remain true and upright**,\nThe **Fragrant Winds** **conform to rhythm**, the **Harmonious Qi** **regulate the seasons**.\nMay **agricultural labors** accumulate in the **capital’s

**together fulfill the true fruit’s promise**,\nAbove **manifesting the Celestial Lord’s** **Great Compassion**, below **matching our subjects’** **earnest sincerity**.\nHumbly **petitioned and reported**.\n\n**Twelve Petitions** completed.\n**Relighting the censer**.\n\n**Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, the **Attendant Spirit Officials**—\nLet

Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Originator of the Three Qi,\nThe Most High Dao Lord,\nThe Most High Laozi,\nSummon forth from within my body the Three Five Functionaries,\nLeft and Right Officials and Messengers,\nLeft and Right Incense-Bearers,\nPostal Dragon Cavalry Clerks,\nAttendant Golden Boys,\nFlower-Scattering Jade Maidens,\nThe Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans,\nDirect-Day Incense Officials—\nEach thirty-six in number—**to emerge**.\n\nThose who emerge must don resplendent attire,\nCrowns and sashes with trailing ribbons,\nOpening the Mysterious Daoist Altars of Land and Domain,\nInviting the territorial and divine spirits of the region.\n\nNow, in this quiet night of Dao-work,\nI humbly petition with sincere intent.\nMy earnest devotion is recorded and reported.\nMay the Most High Dao-qi of the Ten-Directional True Ones descend,\nThe Sacred Treasure Light of Auspiciousness flow into my body,\nSo that my petition may swiftly reach the Direct Presence of the Supreme True One of Boundless Dao,\nBefore the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault.\n\n**Invoke the Law-Position.**\n\nWith my rank and name, I and the assembled officials\nSolemnly present our sincere petition to:\nThe Void-Natural Primordial Heavenly Venerable,\nThe Most High Dao Lord,\nThe Most High Laozi,\nThe Most High Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault,\nThe Purple Cloud Heavenly Sovereign Emperor,\nThe Purple Cloud North Pole Emperor,\nThe Sacred Ancestor Heavenly Venerable Emperor,\nThe Earthly Sovereign of the Rear Soil,\nThe Great Saintly Mother of the Primordial Heaven,\nThe Ten-Directional Boundless Dao,\nAll Heavenly Emperors,\nThe Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scripture Masters of the Mysterious Middle,\nThe Fire Star Law-Enforcing True Lord of the Rounded Canopy,\nThe Star Lords of the Manifested and Transformed,\nThe Sovereigns of the Thick Earth Caverns and Mountain-Spirit Altars,\nThe Southern Fire Department Officials of the Vermilion Position (Homogeneous and Fire Branches),\nThe Three Realms of Responsive Spirits,\nAll True and Sacred Spirits.\n\nI have heard that the Yang-Spirit manifests auspiciousness,\nThe Fire Virtue inherits Heaven,\nDividing the solar domain to perpetuate brightness,\nCommanding the Vermilion Quarter to establish position.\nThus, it governs the summer calendar,\nTo rectify the annual functions.\nHence, it ascends and descends through the Crimson Expanse,\nCirculating the Yellow Dao,\nResponding to its appointed time without fail,\nManifesting without partiality.\n\nThough it suspends the celestial symbols for the sake of the nation,\nIts disasters and blessings also extend to all living beings.\nWe, though favored by divine grace,\nDwelling in this prosperous age,\nHave yet to purify our hearts and refine our essence,\nRetreat to the misty peaks,\nMingling in the turbid world, conforming to mundane affairs.\nYet, to aid humanity and the state,\nTo rescue beings as our priority—\nAll who seek sincerity must be elevated in response.\nHow much more so when we present our heartfelt words,\nDaring not to withhold them—\nThus, we solemnly proclaim our petition.\n\n**Proclaim the Petition.**\n\nAs the words declare,\nThe sincerity is fervent and urgent.\nWhen questioned, it is indeed so—\nWhen examined, it does not stray.\n\nIt is reported that in the lofty vault above,\nThe profound and subtle realm,\nThe Fire Virtue shines resplendent—\nThe Imperial Response is the Quail Star.\nCounting the Earth-Two Spirit’s power,\nIts influence grows ever stronger;\nPositioned at the Vermilion Bright’s apex,\nIts eminence is unmatched.\n\nEarth generates Metal, emerging from the Tiger Hour, entering the Dog Hour,\nExamining the hot and cold to discern concealment and manifestation,\nObserving the celestial symbols to distinguish calamity and blessing.\nIn its appointed duties, it is rewarded with the honor of the sacrificial feast;\nWhen supplicating for relief from illness, it demands the solemnity of incense and fire.\n\nThough we are but humble mortals,\nEver indebted to the True Ones’ grace,\nWe have long harbored the resolve of the deep ice,\nOffering the sincerity of the wolf and badger,\nReverently consulting the secret texts,\nHumbly presenting our clear offerings.\n\nNow, in this quiet night of Dao-work,\nI request the assembled Law-Masters to light the first pinch of incense.\nMay this incense-cloud ascend to the heavens,\nOffering to the Most High Three Venerables.\nWe devote our bodies, our spirits, our fates,\nProstrating with our heads to the ground,\nSupplicating the Great Saint Fire Star Law-Enforcing True Lord.\n\nWe humbly pray that You temporarily abandon Your mansion,\nTo preside over this assembly from afar.\nWith crimson banners and scarlet flags,\nPurple mists and red clouds,\nSacred flames converging,\nThe fierce spirits in attendance.\nRadiant at the celestial threshold,\nNurturing all beings.\nThe clear wind blazes forth,\nIlluminating the void.\nWhen You descend, blessings follow—\nWhere disaster lingers, it departs;\nWhere none arrive, they come.\nGolden embers and orchid incense,\nIlluminating the nine abysses of darkness;\nSandalwood smoke and jade waters,\nDriving away the misfortunes of unvirtuous times.\n\nWe earnestly hope that the Great Fire flows in tranquility,\nThat the Gradual Departure is banished,\nJoining the Five Phases in auspiciousness,\nWarding off the Three Scorches with no fear,\nRaising the hundred blessings of cessation,\nReturning to the multitude of virtuous scholars,\nObscure yet vast—this humble heart.\n\nNow, we burn this incense,\nSolemnly devoting ourselves to the Dao-Venerable Great Saints’ True Essence.\nAfter attaining the Dao,\nWe preserve Heaven’s longevity,\nIn harmony with the Dao’s True Essence.\n\nNow, in this quiet night of Dao-work,\nI request the assembled Law-Masters to light the second pinch of incense.\nMay this incense-cloud ascend to the heavens,\nOffering to the Most High Three Venerables.\nWe devote our bodies, our spirits, our fates,\nProstrating with our heads to the ground,\nWith this pinch of incense’s merit,\nSupplicating the Great Saint Fire Star Law-Enforcing True Lord,\nWhose void contains the Vermilion,\nEmbodying the Water-Stilling Virtue;\nWhose essence is the Sun’s crystal,\nEmbracing the Moon’s generation and transformation.\n\nWith bitterness nurturing sweetness,\nEver bound by propriety,\nOur pious sincerity is answered,\nIlluminating without partiality.\n\nWe earnestly hope that the ancestral altars and sacred spirits,\nThe ancestral halls and forefathers,\nMay delight in the Vermilion Palace,\nAttest to the Vermilion Court,\nFlow their blessings upon the Imperial Map,\nPerpetuate the Great Undertaking,\nFlourish for ten thousand years,\nGathering a thousand auspicious signs.\n\nNow, we burn this incense,\nSolemnly devoting ourselves to the Scripture-Venerable Great Saints’ True Essence.\n\n---\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, ascending into the Formless,\nAnd harmonizing with the True Essence of the Way.\n\nNow, in this tranquil night of Daoic practice,\nWe humbly request the gathered assembly to perform these three incense offerings,\nMay this incense smoke ascend and billow,\nPiercing the heavens to venerate the **Supreme Three Sovereigns** [太上三尊].\nWe, the subjects, **return our bodies, spirits, and fates** [皈身、皈神、皈命],\nBow our heads to the earth in reverence,\nAnd with these incense merits, **solemnly invoke the Great Saint Fire Star Law-Enforcing True Lord** [大圣火星执法真君].\n\nMay we **hide from the dreadful radiance and light** [藏烜惧威光],\nSo as not to incur the **fault of harming the gate or fish** [不致侵门害鱼之咎];\nMay we **beg to halt the fierce and violent manifestations** [乞止赫烈形势],\nAnd forever **avoid the calamity of burning stables and injuring people** [永无焚厩伤人之忧].\nBefore any **evil arises**, may all **auspicious signs manifest** [凶悉未萌，吉皆来兆],\nOur prayers heard without error, our requests granted upon sight [闻祈不忒，见请皆从].\n\nMoreover, we earnestly hope that for our household,\nThe **Vermilion Talismans** [丹箓] may **ward off disasters** [祛灾],\nThat **Pure Virtue** [清都] may **bestow blessings** [介福],\nOur family’s **prosperity may flourish** [家门叶泰],\nAnd our **benevolent thoughts may renew** [善念惟新].\nWithin the **gathered assembly of the Daoic scriptures** [旁周品汇之中],\nAll may **align with the wondrous constancy of the True** [俱契真常之妙].\n\nNow, we burn this incense,\nAnd **devote ourselves to the Virtue of the Scripture-Venerable Great Saints** [自归依经尊大圣众至真之德].\nAfter attaining the Dao, we **forever preserve peace and tranquility** [永保平康],\nAnd harmonize with the True Essence of the Way.\n\nThree **invocations**, three **reverences** [三启，三礼].\nWe **repeatedly proclaim the sacred Daoic ranks** [重称法位].\nWe, the subjects of all **Daoic stations** [具位臣某], along with the **officers attending the altar** [与临坛官众],\nSolemnly **offer our sincere prayers**:\nTo the **Supreme Three Pure Ones and Saints** [太上三清上圣],\nTo the **Jade Sovereign of the Celestial Vault** [昊天玉皇上帝],\nTo the **Nine Sovereigns of Ultimate Reverence** [九皇至尊],\nTo the **Ten Directions’ Scripture-Venerable Saints** [十方上圣],\nTo the **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Scripture Masters of the Mystic Dao** [三十六部尊经玄中大法师],\nTo the **Fire-Deity Supreme True One** [火德上真],\nTo the **Three Realms’ Responsive True Spirits** [三界应感],\nAnd to **All True Spirits** [一切真灵].\n\nWe, the subjects, have heard that **misconduct in human affairs** [滥处人伦]\nAnd **erroneous residence in the sacred age** [缪居圣世],\nFortunately **received the nurturing grace of the Numinous Treasures** [幸承灵宝荫育],\nAnd **glimpsed the true Daoic teachings** [得睹蕊笈真科].\n\nWe know that **blessings arise from virtue, calamities from licentiousness** [有福善祸淫],\nAnd that **they originate from the intentions of the heart** [在操心之所致].\nWe fear that if one **believes in falsehoods and reverses one’s vision** [信邪倒见],\nThey may **fail to repent and return to the Dao** [莫反念以归依].\n\nOnly the **Supreme Most High** [无上之元尊],\nThrough **marvelous Daoic methods of the provisional** [假有为之妙法],\nHas **manifested in sacred scriptures** [昭垂经典],\nAnd **forever enlightens the obscured and ignorant** [永觉昏蒙],\n**Warding off calamities even before their signs appear** [禳於未兆之间],\nSo that **there may be no regret for past deeds** [安有追前之悔].\n\nNow, the **Daoic official** [醮官] humbly **devotes himself to the Great Dao** [投诚大道],\nAnd **earnestly supplicates all the heavens** [沥恳诸天].\nWe **often reflect upon our own unawareness** [每惟自不觉知],\nAnd how **small transgressions may lead to great consequences** [渐小愆而致甚].\nWe **constantly worry about shifting fate and cosmic cycles** [常忧变更运数],\nOr that **accumulated karmic deeds may prove inescapable** [或积业以难逃].\n\nDay and night, we **never cease in our vigilance** [夙夜靡遑],\nAnd **our actions and retreats are guided by reflection** [行藏在念].\nWe **consider the seven treasures and five grains** [七珍五谷],\nLest they **bring accumulated harm and misfortune** [虑有积而不散之非].\nWe **fear for the six livestock and two silkworms** [六畜二蚕],\nFor their **extreme abundance may invite retribution** [恐昭物极恶盈之罪].\n\nNow, we **present these humble Daoic rites** [陈菲薄醮礼],\nAnd **pray to the Upholder of the Fire Star** [祷谢荧惑星君],\n**Reverently following the rules of the Celestial Gate** [恭按阙伯之规模],\nAnd **hoping to fulfill the benevolent response of Duke Jing** [愿遂景公之仁感].\n\nWe **take pity on this humble reverence** [悯兹惕若],\nAnd **grant it peace and security** [锡以安然],\nSo that our **neighborhoods may know no sudden disasters** [里域无卒暴之惊],\nAnd our **abodes may rest in tranquil comfort** [居止有清闲之慰].\n\nIn **all four seasons**, we **enjoy serenity** [四时宁谧],\nAnd in **the eight festivals**, we **rejoice with delight** [八节欣怡].\nWe **extinguish the improper light of lamps and candles** [绝灯烛非次之光],\nAnd **quell the

harmonizing** [澄清], so that **all may dwell in virtuous contentment** [乐业],\nAnd **reside in tranquility and embrace benevolence** [安居怀仁].\nWe **sincerely pray for the flourishing of goodness**

their livelihood**, may they **find ease and joy** [谋生遂安逸之欢],\nAnd for those **dwelling in the wilds**, may they **sing in celebration** [在野有讴歌之乐].\n\nMay **all things rise and fall in accordance with

[招神] and restraining the **winds** [摄风].\nThey **command and subdue the myriad spirits** [役使万灵],\nGuarding the **Immortal Sage** [上卫仙翁],\nIn harmony with the **True Dao** [和与道合真].\n\n**Sound the Daoic Drum** [鸣法鼓] **twenty-four times** [二十四通].\n\nWe now **invoke the Supreme Three Heavens’** [无上三天] **Primordial Origin of the Dao** [玄元始三炁],\nThe **Supreme Dao Lord** [太上道君],\nThe **Supreme Old Lord** [太上老君],\nAnd **summon forth** [召出] from within our subjects’ bodies the **Thirty-Five Officials of the Dao** [身中三五功曹],\nThe **Left and Right Officials and Messengers** [左右官使者],\nThe **Left and Right Incense-Bearers** [左右捧香],\nThe **Dragon-Courier and Mounted Attendants** [驿龙骑吏],\nThe **Golden Boys Attending the Incense** [侍香金童],\nThe **Jade Maidens of the Transmitted Words and Scattered Flowers** [传言散花玉女],\nThe **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans** [五帝直符],\nAnd the **Direct-Day Incense Officials** [直日香官],\nEach **thirty-six in number** [各三十六人], to appear.\n\nThose who emerge are **arrayed in solemn, resplendent garments** [严装显服],\nWith **headdresses and sashes trailing their ribbons** [冠带垂缨],\nOpening the **Mysterious Daoic Altars** [关启玄坛] to the **Land Spirits** [土地] and **Divine Sovereigns of the Regions** [方域神真].\n\nOur subjects now **establish this Daoic Feast** [今设醮行道],\nAnd **solemnly present this invocation** [谨奏为入意],\nHaving already **recorded and transmitted** [已录告闻] the **sincere intentions** [诸诚意].\nMay we **obtain the Supreme Dao’s** [太上十方至真道炁] **blessed light and luminous treasures** [灵宝瑞光],\nDescending and **flowing into our subjects’ bodies** [下降流入臣身中],\nThat our subjects’ prayers may **swiftly reach the Celestial Vault of the Jade Sovereign** [令臣所启速达径御至真无极大道、昊天玉皇上帝御前].\n\n**Request the proclamation of the Daoic ranks** [请称法位].\n\nIn full assembly, our subjects **so-and-so** [某] and the **officiating officials** [临坛官众],\n**Together present this sincere invocation** [谨同诚上启] to:\n\nThe **Primordial Origin of the Jade Sovereign of the Natural Void** [虚无自然元始天尊],\nThe **Supreme Dao Lord** [太上大道君],\nThe **Supreme Old Lord** [太上老君],\nThe **Jade Sovereign of the Celestial Vault** [昊天玉皇上帝],\nThe **Grand Sovereign of the Purple Cluster** [紫微天皇大帝],\nThe **Grand Sovereign of the Northern Polarity** [紫微北极大帝],\nThe **Divine Ancestor, Sovereign of the Dao** [圣祖天尊大帝],\nThe **August Land Spirit, Earthly Sovereign** [后土皇地祇],\nThe **Primordial Great Sage, Empress of Heaven** [元天大圣后],\nThe **Dao of the Ten Directions’ Limitless Extent** [十方无极大道],\nThe **Sovereigns of All Heavens** [诸天天帝],\nThe **Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures, Master of the Mysterious Central Dao** [三十六部尊经玄中大法师],\nThe **True Lord of the Dao Who Executes the Law of the Fire Star in the Round Dome** [圆穹上象火星执法真君],\nThe **Manifested and Transformed Celestial Hosts and Star Lords** [所变所化、列宿星君],\nThe **Sovereigns of the Earthly Caverns and Mountainous Altars** [厚地洞天、岳渎主宰],\nThe **Officials of the Southern Fire Position, Ranked Homogeneous and Heterogeneous** [南方离位丙丁巳午火部官属],\nThe **Three Realms of Response and Sensation** [三界应感],\nAnd **all True Spirits** [一切真灵].\n\nOur subjects **hear** that the **Great Dao is profound and mysterious** [大道玄妙],\nThe **origin of the Supreme Ultimate** [混成太极之初];\n\nThat the **Ultimate Truth is naturally so** [至真自然],\nThe **ancestor of Heaven and Earth** [悼为天地之祖].\n\nWith **mechanisms and powers of transformation** [机权造化],\nThey **open and close the yin and yang** [开阖阴阳],\nDividing the **Eight Trigrams** [八卦] to nurture all forms,\nEstablishing the **Four Seasons** [四时] to fulfill all gatherings.\n\nThus, the **Yang** resides in the **Great Summer** [大夏],\nAs the **region of long cultivation** [长养之方];\nThe **Southern Fire** responds in **divine resonance** [南讹],\nFocusing on the **matters of transformation and nourishment** [化育之事].\n\nTherefore, the **Flame Emperor governs the Celestial Vault** [炎帝御宇],\nAnd **Yinghuò** [荧惑] **oversees the region** [司方],\nDividing the **Five Affairs** [五事] in the **ritual texts** [礼文],\nAnd **specializing in the Fourfold governance of Fire** [专四方之火政].\n\nSometimes they **appear and then suddenly vanish** [或当见而忽伏],\nSometimes they **withdraw and then reemerge** [或既缩而复盈].\nTheir **changes are not constant** [其变不常],\nAll for the sake of **manifesting just punishments** [皆为明罚].\n\n「Now the **Ritual Master of the Dao** [醮官] **reverently presents** [某严陈] **ancient precedents** [故事],\nDevoting himself solely to the **Yang Spirit** [阳灵],\nAligning with the **Fire Star’s proper season** [火之正时],\nRepaying the **radiant virtue of the Fire Deity** [报离明之盛德],\nInviting **Daoist companions** [道侣] to gather,\nStrictly adhering to the **auspicious timing** [冲科],\nFormally establishing the **ritual altar** [坛场],\nAnd earnestly summoning the **celestial winds and chariots** [飙驭].\n\n**Humbly praying** [伏愿],\nThat the **Imperial Chariot** [帝车] **arrives swiftly** [接轸],\nFrom the **Tiger Pass and the Celestial Gates** [虎关阊阖];\nThat the **Star Chariot** [星驭] **moves in harmony** [交骖],\nDescending from the **Lion’s Tail and the Hooked Array** [豹尾勾陈].\n\nThe **sacrificial wine** [涧苹] is offered,\nAnd the **libations** [浻酌] are made in solemnity [有严].\n\nWith **deepest reverence and longing** [无任瞻望激切屏营之至],\nI twice bow and gaze toward the clouds,\nTo **reverently welcome the Celestial Procession** [奉迎仙驾].\n\n**Descending the Sage** [降圣],\n**Offering tea** [献茶],\nFirst **presenting** [初献], then **scattering flowers** [散花].\n\nI now **solemnly and sincerely** [谨虔诚] **report to** [上启],\nThe **Supreme Three Pure Ones** [太上三清],\nThe **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault** [玉帝],\nThe **Jade Sovereign of the Supreme Heaven** [昊天玉皇],\nAnd the **Three Realms’ responsive spirits** [三界应感],\nAll **true and genuine essences** [一切真灵].\n\nI have heard that the **Great Sun** [太阳] **divides its light** [分景],\nThis is the **Star of Yinghuò** [荧惑之星];\nThe **Virtue of Fire** [离德] **declares its essence** [宣精],\nIt is also called the **Son of the Vermilion Sovereign** [赤帝之子].\n\nIt **ascends eighty myriads of li** [八十万里] **and radiates colors** [腾彩],\nAnd **spans over a hundred days** [一百余日] **to complete its celestial cycle** [周天].\n\nWherever it **remains or departs** [居留],\nIt **certainly shapes calamities or blessings** [必形灾福].\nWhen it **disturbs the natural order** [乱常],\nIt serves as a **warning against corrupt governance** [以戒昏政];\nWhen it **follows its appointed course** [循度],\nIt **clearly marks the passage of time** [以表明时].\n\nWhen it **converges with the Five Stars** [同五星聚],\nThe world **unifies in harmony** [而天下咸归];\nWhen it **aligns with the Four Stars** [与四星合],\nThe **rulers receive congratulations** [而王者受庆].\n\nShould **chaos and disorder arise** [亡乱],\nAnd **virtue be lost** [失德],\nThen its **fluctuations** [盈缩] **become erratic** [无常].\n\nGazing upward at the **Celestial Patterns of Heaven** [乾文],\nThe **divine records of calamities** [灾数] **are preserved** [皇存].\n\nWhen it **converges with the Year Star** [合岁星], there will be **famine** [则饥馑];\nWhen it **aligns with the Great White Star** [合太白], there will be **upheaval and migration** [则播迁];\nWhen it **unites with the Earth Star** [与土合], governance **becomes increasingly misaligned** [则政益乖];\nWhen it **joins with the Star of the Hour** [与辰合], the **armies fare poorly** [则兵不利];\nWhen the **moon eclipses its mansion** [月蚀其宫], there will be **war and strife** [则为战乱];\nWhen the **heart of the star deviates from its course** [心孛其度], there will be **conflagration and burning** [则主燎焚].\n\nOnly by **cultivating virtue** [修德] can such calamities be **warded off** [可禳],\nAnd by **self-reflection and reverence** [省躬而知畏].\n\nThough **celestial cycles and omens** [运数] **concern the fate of nations** [关於国论],\n**Calamities and auspices** [灾祥] are **indeed bound to the people’s lives** [寔系於民生].\n\nThe **Dao Master** [醮主] of humble name, deeply concerned by accumulated karma inviting calamity, humbly composed this supplication and petitioned for divine favor. With reverence, I dare to unfold my sincere words before the **Celestial Assembly** [法席], and now solemnly proclaim them.\n\n**Proclamation of the Supplication:**\n\nAs the words declare, my sincerity is profound and earnest.\n\nThe Dao Master, born in this age of wondrous transformation, has long revered the **True Wind** [真风]. Now, at the height of summer’s heat, the **Mars** [荧惑] traverses its degree. Though I have always relied upon **virtue** [德], my heart has long held **awe and reverence** [祇畏]. Yet when disasters arise, I must invoke the **preemptive rites of warding** [预禳之典].\n\nI recite the **secret incantations of the Precious Scripture** [宝经], reveal the **true characters of the Cloud Sigil** [云篆], and present the **wondrous patterns** [妙范] in full array, with all rites meticulously observed. **Heaven and humanity interact**, relying upon the **sublime essence** [精祲] to incline in devotion; the **ritual implements are abundant**, and the **fragrant offerings ascend in splendor** [馨香之昭格].\n\nWith the **multitudes of the True Ones** [众真] in attendance, I gaze upon the **Celestial Sovereign’s lofty seat** [上帝之端居], my single mind devoted in reverence, as the **hundred spirits converge**.\n\nI humbly pray that the **Dragon Banner and Phoenix Canopy** [龙旗凤葆] may open **auspicious blessings** [休祥] upon the lower realms, and that the **Sun’s Chariot and Radiant Clouds** [日毂霞车] may amplify the **sublime might of the Celestial Officials** [炎官之威烈].\n\nYour servants, overwhelmed by this petition for grace, now present the **first offering of wine**.\n\n**Scatter flowers.**\n\nI have heard that **diligence in ending as one begins** [谨终如始] is the foundation of human conduct, and that **fearing calamity while turning to virtue** [惧灾向善] is the natural order. Life’s formation depends upon **Heaven and Earth** [乾坤], and all motion and stillness are governed by **Water and Fire** [水火].\n\n**Yin and Yang** [阴阳] form the cosmic framework, overseeing **spirit and vital essence** [魂魄]. In winter, they govern affairs through the **Hour Star** [伺辰], and in summer, they wield authority through **Mars** [荧惑].\n\nNow, in this ninth month of summer, the **Three Stars** [三星] appear in the twilight. How could one not recognize that the **cyclical records of the ancient sages** [阏伯之纪时] align with the **procession of Zhurong** [祝融之行度]?\n\nThe Dao Official, reflecting upon my mundane existence and my place among humanity, kindles fire by day and lights the **Dao’s lamp** [烛道] by night. Though my actions depend upon **human flame**, I may yet fall prey to **celestial disaster** [天灾].\n\nThe **impartial virtue** [无私之德] is boundless, yet common folk ever fear their **transgressions** [有过之民]. With utmost sincerity, I purify my **community altar** [祓社], heeding the **exhaustive rites of Zheng Xia** [郑侨之尽礼], yet I lack the **insight of the Fire Official’s omens** [裨灶之知天].\n\nI now unfold the **secret scriptures** [秘典] once more, bearing my wishes before the **Lofty True Ones** [高真], hoping the **Heart Star** [心星] may retreat and restore the **Celestial Degrees** [天度] in the **high vault** [高穹], nurturing the **abundance of all things** [万物之丰成], so that all beings may **cross safely** [群生之共济].\n\nMay we **roast or boil our offerings** [可燔可炙] without fear of **poisonous winds** [扇毒之虞], and may we dwell and reside **without dread of shifting flames** [徙薪之虑].\n\nNow, the **lotus lamps** [莲灯] flicker toward extinction, yet the **glowing sun’s remnants** [赫曜日之余光] persist. The **precious sigils** [宝篆] are fading, dissolving into the **light mist of floating clouds** [浮云之轻霭]. The **thousand True Ones** have gathered, and the **three offerings** [三献] have concluded.\n\nThe **Dragon returns to the Vermilion Celestial Heights** [丹霄], and the **Phoenix attendants** [鸾仗] prepare to withdraw to the **Crimson Palace** [绛阙]. Fearful of further presumption, I dare not linger beneath the **imminent celestial威**.\n\nI further pray for **boundless compassion** [洪慈] to descend, granting **forgiveness and mercy** [宽贷].\n\nYour servants, overwhelmed by this final petition, now present the **concluding offering of wine**.\n\n**Scatter flowers.**\n\n**Reaffirm the Dao’s station.**\n\nThe humble servant of lowly rank, **Dao Official** [醮官], now humbly reiterates this supplication to the **Nine Pure Ones, Supreme Saints** [九清上圣], and the **True Spirits of the Three Realms** [三界真灵].\n\nYour servants have solemnly performed the **ritual of the sacred censer** [祭爟之仪] to purify the **original calamity** [燎原之厄].\n\nTo the **Supreme Saint of the Jade Capital** [玉京上圣], who receives the **auspicious radiance** [迂景] upon the **Purple Altar** [紫坛], and to the **Stars of the Southern Pole** [南极众星], who also incline their light upon the **embroidered seat** [黼座], we have already exhausted the **flowing wine offerings** [流霞之献] and now ascend the **bright candles’ glow** [明烛之辉].\n\nAgain, we pour out our **earnest prayers** [沥恳] before the **Heavenly Hosts** [诸天], beseeching the **cessation of calamity** [弭灾] from the **Celestial Symbols** [上象]. Having already unfolded the rites at **Mars’ degree** [荧惑之度], we now extend our **sincerity to the Variable Star** [变化之星].\n\nOnly the **residual light of the Law** [执法之余光] disperses the **flaming essence** [炎精] to demonstrate **divine retribution** [示罚].\n\nThe **Dawn Star** [析旦] grows strong in **sovereign governance** [君道], and **Zhaoming** [昭明] presides over **war and mourning** [兵丧]. **Chiyou’s banner** [蚩尤如旗] signals the **sovereign’s campaigns** [王者之征伐], while **Tian Chan** [天搀如剑] foretells the **slaying by generals** [将帅之杀伤]. **Si Wei** [司危] serves to **pacify discord** [平乖争], and the **Red Comet** [赤彗] wields **authority over extermination** [掌诛灭]. These are all **phenomena linked to the Sun** [附日而有象], yet there are also those **associated with the Moon** [因月而垂芒], such as the **Heavenly Obscuration** [天阴晋若] and the **Celestial Official’s Outbreak** [天惑官张].\n\nThe **Red Comet’s strange hues** [赤若异彩] and the **Heavenly Chui’s anomalous forms** [天崔殊形]—all are **officials of calamity** [灾厄之官], each with their **mandate of oversight** [照临之分].\n\nWhen they descend, they become the **Wind Lord** [风伯]; when they manifest as deities, they are called the **Fire Spirits** [火精].\n\nTheir **flames and forces** [势焰] surge in tandem, their **portents and marvels** [光怪] intertwine. I pray that, under the **Celestial Sovereign’s Dao-essence** [天尊之道炁], the **residual might of the Fire Virtue** [火德之余威] may be fully harnessed.\n\nMay the **nation’s path be unburdened** [国步无艰], lest **martial might be unleashed upon the multitudes** [扬威於多垒]; may the **realm rejoice in prosperity** [邦家有庆], so that the **four classes may pursue their labors in harmony** [乐业於四民].\n\nMay there be no **small conflagrations consuming stables** [焚厩之小栽], nor **premonitory warnings of bandits on the roads** [表道之先警]. May the **summer rains arrive in season**, so that **epidemic miasmas** [沴气] do not arise, and may **Yin and Yang harmonize**, yielding **abundant harvests year after year** [年谷屡丰].\n\nYet I still fear the **Five Stars’ transgressions** [五星凌犯] and the **comets’逆流**, for if they appear in the **eastern quadrant of the Azure Dragon’s seven mansions** [青龙七宿分野], I beseech the **True Characters of the Green Emperor** [青帝真文] for **dissolution and warding** [解禳].\n\nIf the **Five Stars transgress and the Red Comet逆流** in the **southern quadrant of the Vermilion Bird’s seven mansions** [朱雀七宿分野], I beseech the **True Characters of the Red Emperor** [赤帝真文] for **dissolution and warding**.\n\nIf the **Five Stars transgress and the White Comet逆流** in the **western quadrant of the White Tiger’s seven mansions** [白虎七宿分野], I beseech the **True Characters of the White Emperor** [白帝真文] for **dissolution and warding**.\n\nIf the **Five Stars transgress and the Black Comet逆流** in the **northern quadrant of the Dark Tortoise’s seven mansions** [玄武七宿分野], I beseech the **True Characters of the Black Emperor** [黑帝真文] for **dissolution and warding**.\n\nIf the **Five Stars transgress and the Yellow Comet逆流** in the **central region of the Hooked Array’s Three Enclosures and the Imperial Seat of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars** [勾陈三垣帝座北斗七元星君], I beseech the **True Characters of the Yellow Emperor** [黄帝真文] for **dissolution and warding**.\n\nMay the **Emperor and Sovereign reign for ten thousand years** [帝主万年], their **lineage enduring a hundred generations** [本支百世]. May the **celestial patterns remain in order** [天文有序], and the **earthly cycles endure** [地纪常容]. May the **nation grow wealthy and families prosperous** [国富家康], the **times harmonious and the people flourishing** [时和俗阜].\n\nOnly then shall the **Dao Official and his household** [醮官某家等] find **spiritual peace and bodily ease** [神安体裕], their **fortunes extended and longevity assured** [益算延龄], their **blessings and merits renewed** [福禄维新], with **no return of misfortune** [凶衰不作], their **kinfolk thriving and their dwellings serene** [眷属亨泰，所止肃清], their **towns and villages at rest** [井邑静安], and their **regions in tranquility** [方隅宁谧].\n\nAll petitions shall be **fully granted** [悉荷保全], extending **universal protection to all living beings** [普及生灵], so that all may **equally share in divine favor** [均叨庇佑].\n\nYour servants, overwhelmed by this **final gratitude** [祈谢之至], now **bow before the Celestial Throne** [拜首天阶] and humbly present this **concluding offering**.\n\n**Reignite the incense brazier.**\n\n**Incense Officials and Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the Attendant Spirit Officials of the Incense**, now command that at the site where this **Dao Rite** [设醮] was established, **golden elixirs and jade-green herbs** [金液丹碧], **mushrooms and hundred-spirits’ blessings** [芝英百灵] shall naturally manifest. The **multitudes of True Ones** shall converge at this **incense and flame altar** [香火炉前].\n\nNow let the Ten-Direction Daoist youth and maiden attendants,\nattend to the fragrant incense vapors,\nand swiftly transmit our humble petitions\nto the **Supreme Ultimate Great Dao of the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Court** [至真无极大道、昊天玉皇上帝御前].\n\n**Conclude the offering, transform the

Dao does not discriminate in its judgments** [道无私於降鉴].\n**The Highly Pure respond to sincerity** [高真应感],\nand **the divine is moved by genuine devotion** [诚自格於灵承].\n\nThus, we lay bare our sincere

[优持造化之权].\nTheir **manifestations are timely** [其伏见有时],\nand their **auspicious or inauspicious signs are clear** [其吉凶有兆].\nThe heavens act without disorder,\nand their responses are without favoritism.\nIf one harbors **reverence for the stern and the awe-inspiring** [严知畏之心],\nthen **uncommon blessings shall descend** [必降殊常之祉].\n\nWe, the Daoists of such-and-such lineage, are fortunate

The undersigned and all disciples humbly submit our bodies, our spirits, and our lives to the Supreme Ten-Directional Numen, the Natural and Primordial Dao of Boundless Truth. We beseech thee to grant us forgiveness—ourselves and the officiating assembly—for all transgressions of past and present lives, freeing us from the Three Evil Paths, the Ten Sufferings and Eight Hardships, and the Nine Calamities, that we may attain the Dao’s True Essence, traverse the void, ascend to Heaven in broad daylight, and attend upon the Dao Sovereign in the Boundless Golden Threshold and the Seven-Treasured Natural Palace, forever harmonizing with the Dao.**\n\n**All petitions of Mysterious Grace are presented before the Supreme Dao of Boundless Truth.**\n**Repentance is offered.**\n**The Law’s Titles are solemnly invoked once more.**\n\n**The present officials and all others, with united sincerity, hereby present our petition. To the Supreme Dao of Boundless Truth, the Primordial Celestial Venerable, the Supreme Dao Sovereign, the Supreme Lord of Old Age, the Jade Emperor of Augmented Heaven, the Great Imperial Sovereign of the Starry Enchen Court, the Grand Imperial Sovereign of the Celestial Pole, the Earthly Sovereign of the Five Empires, the Supreme Lord of Natural Earth, the Boundless Dao of Ten Directions, the Celestial Venerable of Moral Dao and Sacred Worthies, the Great Emperor of Supreme Truth, the Heavenly Emperor, the Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures, and the Mysterious Master of the Central Dao—we humbly invoke thee, the Five Celestial Masters of Wuji and the True Spirit of Central Yellow.**\n\n**In the Dragon and Han epochs, spanning countless kalpas, we were lost in the nameless chaos. When the Imperial Sovereign’s plan unfolded, the people’s customs were shaped by desire. The Primordial Dao divided its essence to respond to transformation, and the Divine Sacrificial Ox emerged with wisdom to awaken potential. After shifting from caves to dwellings, we raised beams and pillars. Through agriculture and cultivation, we gained the advantage of pestles and mortars; refining fur and blood, we found the utility of stoves and cauldrons. The Six Ministries were well-ordered, and the Three Hierarchies established. Thus, from the warmth of Yang and the chill of Yin, the harshness of Jia and the softness of Yi, life and death were hidden in the formless, and blessings and misfortunes concealed in the unfathomable. Only through the study of scriptures did we gradually perceive the ties of mundane existence.**\n\n**Though we are but humble grass and insignificant dust, weak in nature and lowly in origin, we have been fortunate to inherit the lingering blessings of past ages and to encounter this enlightened time. Having secured a dwelling to reside in, we now earnestly seek the Heavenly Sovereign’s gracious favor, reverently observing the fasts and rites of purification, and giving thanks to the True Spirits.**\n\n**As we have been entrusted with the office of the True Ministry and honored as leaders of the Dao, our duty is to propagate its teachings and our aspiration to establish merit. None who seek sincerity shall be left unanswered. Today, we present our heartfelt words and dare not withhold them. Our petition is now declared.**\n\n**According to our words, we solemnly vow: We shall purify our five limbs with bathing, refine our six emotions, follow the rites for averting disasters and calamities, and perform the methods for securing a tranquil abode and harmonious dwelling. We arrange the altar as prescribed, and its design mirrors Heaven. With the offerings of the officiating household—silk, brocade, and devotional tokens—we pacify the Five Directions. With incense, flowers, lamps, and candles, we affirm our sincere and earnest resolve.**\n\n**From this day forward, we establish this fast as its beginning. When the appointed time arrives and our petition is heard by the Supreme Truth, we shall pray for blessings and grace, for the peace of spirits and the resolution of offenses, all in accordance with the fast’s precepts. Previously, we have already presented our petition, and our gratitude is directed to the Supreme Three Venerables and the Ten-Directional Sacred Worthies, who deign to inspect and reflect upon our supplications. We now command the appointed inspectors, the land and territorial deities, to unite in heart, to join in strength, and to sweep away all impurities within and without. May the altar be cleansed and the path to the void be opened, that the True Saints may descend in response, granting our hearts tranquility and our spirits steadfastness. With our thoughts focused and our petitions heard, let our good deeds be fulfilled without obstruction.**\n\n**On the following bright dawn, we shall continue our Dao practice and renew our petition.**\n**Twelve Vows are hereby declared.**\n\n**Reigniting the Incense Altar**\n\nThe incense officials and messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit officials of incense—now command that the places where I have previously established the altar and practiced the Dao shall spontaneously generate golden elixir and jade-green herbs, numinous grasses and spirits, as the myriad True Ones gather before this incense altar.\n\nMay I now vow that the celestial youths and jade maidens of the Ten Directions attend to the fragrant mists, transmitting my sincere supplications directly to the Supreme True One of the Unfathomable Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign’s Court. **Exit the hall to chant.** **Exit the door.**\n\n*End of Volume Thirty-Seven of the Grand Compilation of Daoist Rituals and Precepts*\n*Volume Thirty-Eight of the Grand Compilation of Daoist Rituals and Precepts*\n*Compiled by the Three Cavern Scripture and Talisman Disciple Zhong Li*\n**Ritual Thirty-Eight: Anning and Exorcism Ceremony – Conducting the Dao at Dawn**\n\n**Conducting the Dao at Dawn**\nPerform the ritual rites upon the altar as prescribed.

all **true spirits** gather here,\n　　At this **incense and fire altar**.\n\n　　May the **Ten Thousand Directions’** **celestial children** and **jade maidens**,\n　　Attend to the **fragrant

responsive true spirits**.\n\n「The disciple hears that the **Dao’s transformations** have been manifest,\nAnd the **mysterious winds** spread far and wide,\nGiving rise to **spirits of life** and their **variations**,\nTo fully display the **virtue/power** of the **spirits**.\n\nFrom this, **feathered halls and misty chambers** emerge,\nWhere **clouds condense** and **qi coalesces**,\nFloating clouds symbolize **forms**,\nResponding to things and manifesting **spiritual efficacy**.\n\nIn the **Upper Antiquity**, the **saints** followed Heaven and embodied the Dao,\nEstablishing **palaces** to replace **cavernous nests**,\nTaking the **principles of the Two Poles** (yin-yang) as their model,\nAnd dividing the **five types of qi** (wuxing),\nThus setting the **positions of yin and yang**,\nAnd clarifying the **distinctions between calamity and auspiciousness**.\n\nThe **Heavenly and Earthly officials** govern their duties accordingly.\nWhen **virtue** prevails, it **prolongs blessings** and **brings good fortune**,\nEnsuring **safety and tranquility**;\nWhen **evil** prevails, it **invokes misfortune** and **brings disaster**,\nLeading to **calamitous retribution**.\n\nThus, the **rites for rectifying and averting** were established,\nTo solemnly **express prayers of thanks and repentance**.\n\nMoreover, our **intentions lie in achieving merit**,\nAnd **solely in benefiting others**.\nAll who **petition and appeal**,\nHow could we **dare not present** their cases?\n\nThe **disciple of such-and-such rank**, through the **construction of this dwelling**,\nNot knowing the **prohibitions and taboos**,\nFears that due to **repairs and renovations**,\nWe may **offend the spirits** and **transgress the Dao**.\n\nWe dread **offending the Heavenly Sovereign**,\nThe **four seasons and six qi** (six climates),\n**Defying the True Dao** and **inviting calamity and decline**.\n\nWe also fear **offending the Celestial Officials**—\nThe **Grand Duke of the Year** (太岁), **Grand Duke of the Moon** (太阴), **Flying Yen** (飞廉), **Tiger’s Tail** (豹尾),\nThe **officers of yin and yang**, the **gods of punishment and slaughter** (刑杀), and the **Ten Celestial Stems and Twelve Earthly Branches deities** (支干众神).\n\nWe further fear **offending the Earthly Officials**—\nThe **Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams** (九宫八卦),\nThe **Earthly Palaces and Soil Sovereigns** (地宫土府),\nThe **spirits of the yin realm** (阴境灵祇),\nAnd through **construction and labor**,\n**Disturbing the Dao’s harmony**.\n\nWe also fear that the **land where we reside**,\nMay be **deeply marked by time and fate**—\nPerhaps it was once an **ancestral homestead or field**,\nA **ruined palace or imperial site**;\nOr a **sacred mountain or spirit’s trace** (灵迹),\nA **blessed

Astonished, he inquired: *\"This is not a place where one should wander—how did you come here?\"*\n\nThe woman replied: *\"I am neither mortal nor a spirit, but the **Hearth Deity’s Cook** (灶中炊母). Though I possess divine transformations, I dwell among humanity. I come here each time to await your august presence, seeking to inquire about human fortunes and misfortunes.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"I wish to proclaim this for you.\"*\n\nThe Cook replied: *\"In matters of human destiny, the **Hearth Deity** (灶君) is paramount—above as a celestial omen, below as a talisman, and among mortals as the **Hearth Deity**. All calamities fall under their purview, from the highest realms of state to the lowest of common folk. If one sincerely reveres them, blessings will follow. I now present the most essential teachings—pray grant them to be observed.\n\nThe **Hearth Deity** has **forty-two divine attendants**, some of whom appear on certain days, others not. If worshipped on their appointed days, blessings will come; if worshipped otherwise, misfortune will follow. Moreover, each month they consume different offerings, and their taboo names must be avoided—never to be spoken or transgressed. Now I shall detail these carefully; pray record them for the sake of humanity.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"I wish to hear their names.\"*\n\nThe Cook replied: *\"The **Hearth Deity** bears the surname **Zhang** (张), given name **Dan** (单), with his father named **Ji** (吉) and mother **Li** (利). He has six daughters:\n1. **Gui-you** (癸酉),\n2. **Gui-wei** (癸未),\n3. **Gui-si** (癸巳),\n4. **Gui-mao** (癸卯),\n5. **Gui-chou** (癸丑),\n6. **Gui-hai** (癸亥).\n\nAdditionally, the following are forbidden before the **Hearth Deity**:\n- Appearing in **赤形** (naked or exposed form), disheveled hair, cursing, or shouting in anger;\n- Weeping or wailing, whether loudly or softly;\n- Offering firewood while pouring boiling water onto flames, arranging burning wood improperly, or placing copper or lacquered vessels in the hearth;\n- Placing knives, axes, or brooms above or below the **Hearth Deity**;\n- Burning disordered hair, nails, feathers from fowl, or branches of peach or plum trees;\n- Pouring water over the ashes before the **Hearth Deity**.\n\nIf any of these transgressions occur, disaster will strike immediately. Furthermore, one must not sleep before the **Hearth Deity’s door**, discard unclean ashes nearby, or bathe children in their presence. Should these prohibitions be violated, one will suffer from poverty, eye ailments, or festering sores.\n\nInstead, one must daily dispose of ashes in the **Southern Homogeneous Direction** (南丙地), ensuring prosperity and avoiding the listed calamities. If these precepts are disregarded, misfortune will persist—harvests will fail, litigation will multiply, and private grievances will fester.

complete.\nThus, their hearing, speech, and actions are regulated,\nAnd longevity and well-being are fully attained.\n\nHow much more so when the Sage points to the image and expounds the teachings,\nGuiding them toward the Dao and turning their hearts.\nIf they fail to awaken to the Mysterious Words,\nHow could they transcend calamity and obstruction?\nThey must revere virtue and goodness,\nGradually attaining peace and prosperity.\n\nI, your servant, have confined my physical form to the duality of question and answer,\nInheriting the spirit from the One.\nI recognize the principles of health preservation,\nDiscerning the mechanisms of illness and misfortune.\nFortunate am I that the True Talisman has opened the gate of repentance,\nSo that the path of delusion may be illuminated.\nI now properly initiate the Purple Altar Ritual,\nExtending the Mysterious Symbols to their utmost,\nConfronting the radiant spirits,\nWelcoming the blessings of virtue.\n\nI dare not fail to report this.\n**The Petition is Complete.**\n\n「According to the words of the Petition,\nWith sincere and earnest devotion,\nI strive to honor the Two Extremes with equal reverence,\nAnd exalt the Sovereign of the Nine Heavens with supreme veneration.\n\nWith heartfelt sincerity, I proclaim the One’s ultimate truth,\nAnd with fragrant incense, I kindle the virtues of all beings.\nI adorn the sacred seat upon the Mysterious Void,\nAnd present the divine offerings before the Celestial Symbols.\n\nIn humble attire, my thoughts pure and focused,\nThe Star Altar radiates auspicious signs;\nAs the Bear Constellation traverses the heavens in majesty,\nThe Cloud Path shines with luminous grace.\n\nWith steadfast and lingering devotion,\nNo coldness lingers, but uprightness prevails;\nWith refined and concentrated intent,\nIf there is feeling, then understanding is assured.\n\nI humbly pray to the Supreme Three Venerables,\nThe Ten-Directional Great Saints,\nAnd the Mysterious Law Master of the Dao,\nThat You may extend Your divine discernment,\nOversee my humble supplications,\nAnd command the officials of the Spirit Treasures,\nWho attend the sacred scriptures and divine power,\nThe officials of the Vermilion Seal and Embroidered Robes,\nWho bear the Yedra-Sheep offerings,\nTo traverse the skies with swift steps,\nAssemble at the ritual grounds,\nAnd record my virtues, manifesting my merits.\n\nLet the gates of the vaulted heavens hear my plea,\nAnd may the flowing essence scatter,\nDissolving the dark **Yin** forces of the **Camp** and **Wei** spirits.\nI and my disciples, in body,\nShall be cleansed within and without,\nSubduing demons and evils,\nReaching the Primordial Void,\nAll descending to the True Saints,\nSo that our fasts and rituals may be fulfilled,\nWithout obstruction or hindrance.\n\nAt dawn, I shall continue the Dao,\nAnd once again humbly report.\n\n**The Twelve Vows are Complete.**\n**The Censer is Renewed.**\n\nWith solemn reverence, I now summon\nThe incense officials and spirit messengers,\nThe Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,\nAnd the attending spirit officials of the fragrant incense,\nThat they may naturally arise at the place where I have previously initiated the ritual,\nGenerating golden elixir and verdant jade,\nDivine herbs and myriad spirits,\nAs all True Ones gather here before this censer.\n\nI pray that the Ten-Directional Celestial Youths and Jade Maidens\nMay attend and convey the smoke of my sincere supplications,\nSwiftly transmitting my earnest vows to the Supreme Dao of the Unbounded,\nThe Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven.\n\n**The Praise is Complete upon leaving the Hall.**\n**The Praise is Complete upon leaving the Door.**\n\n**The Complete Canon of Daoist Rituals, Volume Forty-Nine Complete**\n**The Complete Canon of Daoist Rituals, Volume Fifty**\n*Edited by Master Guangting Du of the Broad Achievement*\n**The Unified Ritual of the Northern and Southern Dipper Constellations**\n\nAt dawn, the ritual is performed as prescribed.\nThe assembled officials observe the Master’s intent in accordance with the Dao.\n\nThe **Sacred Guardians’ Incantations** are proclaimed:\nThe **Azure Yang Void** shines forth, its radiance reviving the numinous.\nThe **Divine Tiger** repels malevolence, the **Flying Celestial** tolls its bells.\nThe wicked are crushed, demons bound—ten thousand spirits submit.\nThe **Nine Mysteries** return to the Dao, the **Eight Awe-Inspiring Powers** gather essence.\nA thousand True Ones are summoned, the **Three Primordials** purge the impure.\nThe Left **summons the Central Yellow**, the Right **deploys the Six Ding**.\nSeven rotations, eight harmonies—revolving through the Celestial Scriptures.\nThe **Sacred Transformation** stands majestic, the **Great Dao** now unfolds.\nAuspicious clouds disperse, merging with the **Yellow Court**—harmony with the Dao’s True Essence.\n\nThe **Supreme Law Drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.\n\nWe invoke:\nThe **Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Beginning** [三清],\nThe **Most High Dao Lord** [太上道君],\nThe **Most High Laozi** [太上老君],\nTo summon forth from my body:\nThe **five deceased officials of the Five Departments** [五功曹],\nThe **Left and Right Official Messengers** [左右官使者],\nThe **Left and Right Incense-Bearers** [左右捧香],\nThe **Relay Dragon Cavalry Clerks** [驿龙骑吏],\nThe **Attending Golden Boys** [侍香金童],\nThe **Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens** [传言散花玉女],\nThe **Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols** [五帝直符],\nThe **Direct-Day Incense Officials** [直日香官],\nA total of **thirty-six**—all now emerge.\n\nThe departed array themselves in solemn splendor:\nCrowns and sashes adorned with trailing ribbons,\nOpening the **Mysterious Altar’s Land and Domain Spirits**.\n\nNow, at this dawn ritual, I solemnly offer my sincere devotion.\nMy heart’s earnest supplications have already been recorded and presented.\nI pray that the **Most High Dao’s Ten-Directional True Ones** [十方至真道尊]\nMay descend with **Sacred Treasure Radiance**,\nFlowing into my body,\nThat my vows may swiftly reach the **Most High Unbounded Dao** [无极大道],\nBefore the **Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven** [昊天玉皇上帝].\n\n**The Law Position is Invoked.**\n\nI, **Position-Holder [某]**, along with all assembled officials of this altar,\nSolemnly unite in sincere invocation to:\nThe **Emperor of the Primordial Beginning in the Void-Natural** [虚无自然元始天尊],\nThe **Most High Dao Lord** [太上大道君],\nThe **Most High Laozi** [太上老君],\nThe **Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven** [昊天玉皇上帝],\nThe **Nine Sovereign True Ones** [九皇上真],\nThe **Ten-Directional Perfected Saints** [十方已得道大圣],\nAll **True Ones and Lords** [众至真，诸君丈人],\nThe **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Masters of the Mysterious Middle Law** [三十六部尊经玄中大法师],\nThe **Circular Vault’s Celestial Symbols, Sun, Moon, and Stars** [圆穹玄象、日月星辰],\nThe **North Dipper’s Venerable Emperor** [北斗尊帝],\nThe **Seven Celestial Ministers of the Primordial Stars** [七元辅弼星君],\nThe **Great Emperor of the Southern Dipper** [南极大帝],\nThe **Lord Marshal** [丈人司马],\nThe **Six Celestial Ministers** [六司星君],\nMy **Native Star and Hour** [本命元辰],\nThe **Peak-Hall and Sea-Mountain Spirits** [洞天海岳],\nThe **Three Realms’ Officials and All True Spirits** [三界官属，一切真灵].\n\nI have heard:\nThe **Northern Dipper** dwells in the **Kan position**, where **Primordial Essence** is stored;\nThe **Southern Dipper** presides over the **Li mansion**, where **Supreme Divinity** resides.\n\nThe **Essence** descends to become the **vital spark** [精], to guard the form;\nThe **Spirit** condenses into the **soul** [神], to gather and sustain life [因以聚**生**].\nAll living beings depend upon them—\nThe **Two Poles** govern them in turn.\n\nTheir **virtue/power** benefits all sentient life,\nTheir **virtue/power** endows all movement and function.\nSince the **Two Principles** [二仪] were divided,\nThey became the root from which all beings receive their fate.\n\n**Heaven’s Yang** and **Earth’s Yin**—\nThe **Two Principles** respond and interact;\nAll classes gather in their kinds,\nAnd the myriad things take form without deviation.\n\nThey shape the **transformative capacity** of **molding and refining** [成资陶冶],\nTo complete the **transformation of form** [遂器形之化],\nIncreasing the **rank and stipends** of scholars and commoners,\nBestowing **titles and orders** upon humans and celestial beings,\nExtending or shortening lifespans,\nBringing or removing calamities and blessings.\nWherever life takes form,\nNone can escape their **granting or withholding**.\n\nThis **Ritual Master** [醮主] has long revered the **Daoist lineage**,\nYet has not yet transcended the **profane realm**.\nUnder the **lofty vault’s** shelter,\nBeneath the **Dippers’ luminous governance**,\nI govern myself—\nHow could I merely follow the **Middle Way**?\nIn dealing with others—\nI fear only the **weight of excessive virtue**.\n\nAdvancing, I lack the **accumulation of merit**;\nRetreating, I bear the **regret of later times**.\nI wish to **invite blessings** and **sweep away misfortune**.\n\nThus, I dare to present the **Sacred Jewel’s ritual rites** [灵宝之彝仪],\nTo unfold the **clarity of the River Diagram** [河图之明训],\nAnd join the **Ritual of the Two Dippers** [合醮乎南北二斗],\nTo reverently address the **Heavenly and Earthly Spirits** [遍仰乎天地众真],\nTo confess faults and pray for grace,\nTo **appease calamities** and **implore blessings**.\n\nI have been granted access to **mystic profundities**,\nAnd stand among the **True Officials**.\nGazing upon the **residual radiance of the Cross-Dipper’s rotation**,\nI now present my **reverent submission at the beginning of the **Tian** hour**.\n\nHaving received this sincere petition,\nI dare not fail to report it.\n**Proclamation:** As the words state,\nThe **sincerity is profound and earnest**.\n\nThus, I rely upon the **Divine’s coming aid**,\nTo implement the **proper rituals of the **Zuo Valley** [敔谷之攸宜].\n\nWhen **good deeds are done**, blessings descend—\nAs in the **clarity of Shang’s scriptures** [效商书之明训];\nWhen **calamity strikes**, one fears—\nAs in the **precepts of Zhou’s music** [闻周雅之格言].\n\nNow that this **sincere intent** has been revealed,\nI hope for **Heaven’s compassionate response**,\nThat **pure winds may spread far**,\nAnd **blessings flow abundantly**,\nCommitted to the **Ritual Master’s devotion**,\nIlluminating the **Heavenly Sovereign’s supreme virtue**.\n\nOn this **clear morning**, the **Dao** is performed.\nI request that the **assembly of **Law** bearers** light the **first incense strand**,\nThat this **incense smoke** may ascend directly to the heavens,\nTo **venerate the Three Supreme Ones** [太上三尊],\nAnd the **Ten Directions’ Holy Saints** [十方众圣].\n\nI and my followers **take refuge in body, spirit, and fate**,\nWith this **incense-offering’s merit**,\nTo pray for the **Emperor’s longevity and prosperity**.\nMay the **Divine Plan endure eternally**,\nAnd the **Sage’s life extend far**.\n\nWith the **Golden Mirror** held low,\nAll lands shall shine with prosperity;\nWith the **Jade Tassels** held in solemn dignity,\nThe **Eight Seas** shall be serene.\n\nLet **loyal ministers** serve in the morning,\nAnd the people attain **wealth and longevity**.\nLet the **Empress and Consorts** be reserved,\nTo **assist in the auspicious period**.\n\nLet the **Princesses and Princes** be secure,\nAnd the **state’s fortunes rest in peace**.\nBeyond the **Fire Rat and Dragon’s torch**,\nLet **treasures and tributes** rush to come;\nIn the **lands of Yu’s springs and Meng’s valleys**,\nLet **wagons and documents** flow as one.\n\nNow I burn incense,\nIn **sincere reverence** to the **Dao/Way’s** august and sacred **Sages**—the **ultimate virtue/power** of the **至真** (*Zhìzhēn*—\"Most True\").\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way**,\nI ascend to the realm of **wuwei** (non-action),\nIn harmony with the **Dao/Way’s** true essence.\n\nWith today’s **auspicious dawn** and **Dao/Way’s** practice,\nI invite the **Law’s Assembly** to take this **second twist** of incense.\nMay this incense’s smoke ascend straight to the heavens,\nTo **offer homage** to the **Supreme Dao/Way’s** sacred scriptures,\nAnd to the **Sages** of the **Ten Directions**.\n\nWe submit our **bodies, spirits, and fates**,\nThat through this **merit/virtue/power**,\nIt may flow back to the household of **disciple** [name omitted],\nThrough **nine generations and seven mystical lineages**,\nCountless ancestral branches—**a hundred million generations**—\nAnd to our **living and departed kin**, as well as **spiritual rites**.\n\nWe humbly pray that, riding the **purple talisman’s** profound efficacy,\nWe may ascend to the **vermilion realm** of the **Immortal**s.\n\nMay **yang radiance** refine our essence,\nAnd **fiery alchemy** transform our form;\nLet **black records** be erased, and **blue registers** sealed.\n\nIn the **effortless realm of truth**,\nMay all **afflictions and misfortunes** be forever dispelled;\nIn **auspicious blessings** granted,\nMay we enjoy **peace and prosperity’s** enduring grace.\n\nNow I burn incense,\nIn **sincere reverence** to the **Dao/Way’s** august and sacred **Sages**—the **ultimate virtue/power** of the **至真** (*Zhìzhēn*—\"Most True\").\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way**,\nI ascend to the **formless realm**,\nIn harmony with the **Dao/Way’s** true essence.\n\nWith today’s **auspicious dawn** and **Dao/Way’s** practice,\nI invite the **Law’s Assembly** to take this **third twist** of incense.\nMay this incense’s smoke ascend straight to the heavens,\nTo **offer homage** to the **Supreme Dao/Way’s** three **Masters**,\nAnd to the **Sages** of the **Ten Directions**.\n\nWe submit our **bodies, spirits, and fates**,\nThat through this **merit/virtue/power**,\nIt may flow back to **disciple** [name omitted],\nWith **calamities and misfortunes** now stilled,\nAnd **hardships** dissolved—\nMay the **Dao/Way’s** essence permeate our beings,\nAnd **numinous truths** guard and protect us.\n\n**Nanchang Master of Fate**,\nOpens the **red ledger** to extend our years;\n**Beifu Imperial Lord**,\nCrosses out the **black records** to avert our deaths.\n\nMay our **souls and spirits** be cleansed and upright,\nSo that **all ten thousand beings** may long endure.\n\nOur **kin and loved ones** share in **verdant blessings**,\nTogether basking in **auspicious fortune**.\n\n**Ascending and descending** differ in **essence**,\n**Movement and stillness** vary in **form**—\nYet all may be **bathed in celestial repose**,\nAnd **attain bodily well-being**.\n\nNow I burn incense,\nIn **sincere reverence** to the **Dao/Way’s** august and sacred **Sages**—the **ultimate virtue/power** of the **至真** (*Zhìzhēn*—\"Most True\").\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way**,\nI ascend to the **formless realm**,\nIn harmony with the **Dao/Way’s** true essence.\n\nI **chant the directions**, **confess the directions**, and **walk the void**—\nThree **rites of homage**.\n\nI **reaffirm the Law’s ranks**,\nAnd with **sincere devotion**, we now address:\n\nThe **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** of **emptiness and nature**,\nThe **Supreme Dao/Way Lord**,\nThe **Supreme Old Lord**,\nThe **Celestial Jade Emperor**,\nThe **Nine Sovereigns** of **ultimate truth**,\nThe **Sages** of the **Ten Directions** who have attained the **Dao/Way**,\nThe **Most True** **Sages**,\nAll **honored ancestors and lords**,\nThe **Thirty-six Divisions** of **sacred scriptures** and **profound Dao/Way**,\nThe **Circular Vault** of **mystic symbols**—\nThe **sovereigns of the sun, moon, stars, and Northern Dipper**,\nThe **Seven Primordial Stars** of **auxiliary assistance**,\nThe **Southern Polar Emperor**,\nThe **Lord of the Six Ministries**,\nOur **native star and fateful hour**,\nThe **Celestial Peaks and Oceanic Mountains**,\nThe **officials of the Three Realms**,\nAnd all **numinous truths**.\n\nWe hear that the **Seven Primordial Stars** reside to the **north of Taiwei**,\nAs the **pivotal mechanism** of **creation and transformation**;\nAnd the **Six Ministries** are to the **east of Shuo**,\nGuiding the **termination and renewal** of the **sun and moon**.\n\nThus it is known that the **Fire Official** holds the north as noble,\nThe **Water Deity** the center as exalted—\nOne governs the **cycling of Heaven and Earth**,\nSetting in motion the **balancing mechanisms** of **creation and transformation**;\nOne **honors the worthy and advances scholars**,\nIlluminating the **profound virtue/power** of **rank and reward**.\n\nThey embody **Dao/Way and virtue/power**, casting their luminous influence,\nAiding **Heaven and Earth** in nurturing all things.\n\nTo **ascend in fortune and longevity**,\nOne must **pray to the numinous and true**.\n\nFrom my **past life** to this day,\nMy **offenses accumulate like mountains and seas**,\nWhile my **merit is as light as a feather**—\nSometimes defying **Heaven and Earth’s benevolent embrace**,\nSometimes betraying the **virtue/power of the sun and moon’s illumination**,\nViolating the **nature of the Five Phases**,\nDisrupting the **harmony of the Three Lights and Six Seasons**,\nUnaware of **karmic causes and effects**,\nIgnorant of **taboos and prohibitions**,\nTransgressing sacred teachings,\nDaring to offend celestial portents,\nNever having **repented or atoned**—\nLest I invite **calamity and retribution**.\n\nNow, **returning to the True** and **knowing my fate**,\nI **repent in my heart**,\nHoping to **open the boundless mercy** of the **Great Forgiveness**,\nThat I may **find the path of self-renewal**.\n\nI **revere the Six Ministries of the Southern Celestial Palace**,\nAnd the **Seven Primordial Stars of the Northern Dipper**—\nThey **measure the essence of transformation**,\nAnd none escape their **decree as the source of life**;\nThey **uphold the teachings of creation**,\nAnd all things **rely upon them for sustenance**.\n\nThe solemn and reverent rules of the **Altar of Serenity** are observed,\nWith humble offerings of **incense and prayers** presented,\nWords and sincerity poured forth in devotion,\nExhausting all intent to return with true faith—\nRepenting past transgressions,\nAmending future shortcomings,\nInvoking a hundred blessings,\nPurging all calamities,\nEnsuring the unity of my family,\nAnd praying for the peace of the realm’s borders.\n\nTo cease lawsuits and disputes,\nThat stagnant paths may open wide;\nTo attain prosperity and honor,\nHoping my petitions may be granted.\n\nMay I be **released from the register of the Underworld** in the **Domain of Ultimate Yin**,\nAnd ascend to **renown in the Hall of Celestial Yang**.\n\nMay the **Imperial Vision** endure in **Enlightened Clarity**,\nAnd the **Four Seas** forever resound with **abundance and prosperity**.\n\nMay the **beacons be extinguished**, the valleys at peace,\nWith no warriors at the frontiers;\nMay taxes be light and burdens few,\nThat every household may have scholars and poets.\n\nMay officials **align with the Celestial Pole**,\nAnd the people **settle in harmony**—\nFitting that all hearts may flourish,\nThat all malevolence may return to rectitude.\nMay **Grace permeate all things, living and growing**,\nAnd **Bounty extend to the remotest reaches**,\nThat the departed may escape suffering and be reborn,\nAnd all beings may transform with the times.\n\nAbove, I honor the **Great Compassion of the Heavenly Venerable**,\nBelow, I fulfill my subjects’ **sincere return to fate**.\n\nWith reverence, I submit this petition.\n\n**Twelve Vows.**\n\n**Reignite the Furnace.**\n\nWith solemnity, I command the **Incense Officials and Envoys**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, and the **Attendant Spirit Officials of Incense**—\nThat at the place where I formerly performed **morning Dao practices**,\n**Golden Elixir and Jade Green Essence** may spontaneously arise,\nAlong with **Mushrooms, Herbs, and Hundreds of Spirits**,\nAs the **Immortal Assemblies gather before this incense furnace**.\n\nMay I now pray that the **Celestial Children and Jade Maidens of the Ten Directions**,\nAttending to the **fragrant mists**,\nConvey my sincere petitions directly to the **Supreme Dao of the Great Ultimate, the Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty**.\n\n**Exit the Hall.**\n**Exit the Door.**\n\n**The Complete Ritual Canon of the Dao Gate, Volume Fifty-One**\n*Broadened and Refined by Master Guangting Du of the Southern and Northern Dipper Conjunction Rites*\n**Midday Dao Practice**\n\nThe ritual ascends the platform as prescribed.\nEach pays homage to the Master in accordance with the law.\nThe **Spirit-Warding Incantations** are proclaimed.\n\nThe **Cinnabar Spirits and Vermilion Fires** blaze forth, their flames surging like crimson clouds and gusting winds.\nThe **Red Wheel** rolls with unyielding force, its radiance piercing the celestial void.\nIts might envelops all directions, transformations weaving through the ten thousand realms.\nMolten gold cascades, demons vanish without trace—\n**Evil is dispelled, fiends are shattered**, the **Original Virtue** shines forth.\n**Golden Talismans** summon and command; the **Cloud-Striding Dragon** obeys.\nHymns of joy resound, petals scatter across the boundless sky.\nDivine transformations unfold—**the Four Quarters prosper in harmony**.\nBeneath the **Imperial Presence**, none dare be disrespectful—**harmony aligns with the True Dao**.\n\nThe **Supreme Law-Drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.\n\n**The Most High Three Celestial Sovereigns of the Primordial Beginning**—\n**The Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Laozi**—\n**Summon forth from within my body** the **Three Five Officials**, the **Left and Right Attendants**, the **Left and Right Incense-Bearers**, the **Dragon-Courier Clerks**, the **Golden Boy Incense Attendants**, the **Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens**, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**, the **Direct-Sun Incense Officials**—**each thirty-six in number**—to emerge.\n\nThose who emerge are **arrayed in solemn splendor**, their **headdresses adorned with trailing ribbons**, opening the **Mystic Platform’s Earth and Domain Spirits**.\n\nNow, as I perform the **Midday Dao Practice**, I humbly present this as my **sincere intent**. My **earnest petitions** have already been recorded and conveyed. May the **Most High Dao of the Ten Directions** descend with **Divine Treasure Radiance**, flowing into my body, so that my petitions may swiftly reach the **Most High Supreme Dao of the Great Ultimate, the Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty**.\n\n**I now invoke the Law-Position** and, together with all the assembled officials, **sincerely present this petition** to:\n**The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Sovereign of the Void-Natural, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Laozi, the Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty, the Nine Sovereigns of Highest Truth, the Ten-Directional Perfected Saints, the Crowd of Supreme Truths, the Noble Masters of the Thirty-Six Departments, the Rounded Vault of Mystic Symbols—the Celestial Sovereigns of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the North Dipper Emperor, the Seven Celestial Ministers of the Five Agents, the Southern Polar Emperor, the Marshal of the Stars, the Six Celestial Officials, my Native Star, the Cavern-Heavens and Ocean-Peaks, the Three Realms’ Officials, and all Divine Spirits.**\n\nI have heard that the **Round Vault hangs its symbols**, the **waxing and waning** first governed by the **Seven Celestial Stems**; the **Luminous Patterns** shift in their courses, their rotation originating from the **Two Celestial Ministers**. The **Dipper Constellation** marks the celestial calendar, its meaning illuminated in the classics; the **Polar Star** governs the **Celestial Sovereign’s Chariot**, its **Jade Balance** establishing the moon’s course. The **Southern Dipper** resides in the **Tiger Position**; the **Northern Polar Star** truly rules from the **Central Axis**. The **Throat and Tongue** transmute the cosmos, their authority extending to **calendar and symbol**. The **Three Hundred Sixty-Five Degrees** uphold the **Celestial Temple’s guiding principles**; the **Ten Thousand Plus Stars** all submit to the **Dipper’s Ladle’s command**. The **Four Seasons** are regulated by the **Jade Candle**, the **Three Celestial Stems** respond to the **Bronze Instrument**—all governed by the **Two Poles**, assisting the **One Ultimate’s motion**.\n\nAll who dwell within mortal bounds **draw their essence from the Heavenly Pattern**. Though their ranks differ, their **principles converge in unity**.\n\nI, **Dao-Practitioner [Name]**, though granted the **imperial mandate’s destiny** and endowed with **jewel-like purity**, am born of **water and fire’s fundamental nature**, the **Southern and Northern Dipper’s divine descent**. Though I wield the **four elemental forms**, I cultivate the **One True Root**. How dare I not **revere the Mystic**, striving to **return to the Origin**?\n\nI establish the **Platform as the Dipper’s likeness**, encircling the **Imperial Seat with radiant light**; I offer **water and flowers**, gazing toward the **Celestial Pivot’s axis** with unwavering faith. The **rites follow the Secret Edicts**, the **solemn observances adhere to the unique laws**. With reverence for the **nearby威 (awe)**, I dare to **threefold prostrate my petitions**.\n\nI dwell in the **Secret Hall**, ascending the **True Stages**. Though I follow the **Celestial Steps’ order**, I am unworthy of **Pengzi’s daughter’s ascension**; though I **light the lamp for the Dipper**, I lack **Deng De’s sincerity in subduing rebellion**. Yet, if I **proclaim the Mystic Teachings**, perhaps **auspicious blessings** may descend upon the virtuous.\n\nHaving received these **earnest words**, I dare not withhold them. **The Petition is Proclaimed.**\n\nAs the words declare, **my sincerity is profound and urgent**. May my offering ascend to the **Imperial Presence**, permeating the **Celestial Platform**.\n\nThe **Shared Governance** is just, the **Assisting Sovereigns** are impartial. **Life’s sustenance** is equally bestowed; **daily needs** are mutually dependent. Though the **Treasure-Sword** lies hidden, its light still shines in its sheath; though the **Abundant Fox** is of strange kind, it still extends its reverence to the **Dipper’s Ladle**. Since I possess the **most refined essence**, I must recognize **the Origin of All Life**.\n\nThe **True Body of the Dao** manifests through the **transformations of water and fire**; the **Heavenly Form** is ever-changing in the **celestial courses**. Thus, I **conduct the Conjunction Rites on this unified platform**, solemnly revering the **Supreme Celestial’s brilliance**.\n\nThe **lofty Heavenly Beam** spans the **Yellow River’s source**, its pillars interlocked; the **resplendent Jade Dipper** rotates with the **Dragon’s Ladle and Horn**, its motion ever-leftward. I **fix my thoughts on the high vault**, my spirit **soaring through the Mystic Symbols**, wishing to **descend upon the winds and clouds**, humbly casting aside past shame.\n\nMay all who pass be **transformed**, all who remain be **deified**—**bringing blessings to family and nation**. May **flourishing prosperity** bring **longevity and joy**, extending **blessings to both the visible and unseen**.\n\nWith **fragrant incense rising**, I **attain the boundless grace**. Now, as I perform the **Midday Dao Practice**, I request that the **Law-Assembled** kindle the **first incense strand**. May this **smoke ascend directly to the heavens**, offering **sustenance to the Most High Three Sovereigns and the Ten-Directional Saints**.\n\nI, along with all present, **submit my body, my spirit, my fate**—\nWith these **merits and virtues**, I **pray for the current Emperor**.\n\nMay **clarity and brilliance** shine together, the **Celestial Pivot and Polar Star** align in harmony.\nMay **forms and symbols** be perfected, surpassing even my own body in reverence;\nFrom **south to north**, may all be **molded by the Dao’s transformations**.\n\nMay the **Heavenly Steps** be unobstructed, **human culture** flourish eternally.\nThe **principles** gleam like the **order of stars**; the **land endures as Heaven does**.\n**Grain and rice** abound like **water and fire**; the **seasons are harmonious, the years bountiful**.\n\nNow, as I **burn this incense**, I **take refuge in the Dao’s Perfected Saints and Supreme Truths**.\nAfter attaining the **Dao**, I shall **ascend to the Formless**, **harmonizing with the True Dao**.\n\n「Now, as the hour of **midday** approaches and the **Way** is practiced, I humbly **invite the Dharma Assembly** to move these **two incense sticks**, and **offer incense** to the **Perfected Saints and Supreme Truths**. May this incense smoke ascend straight to the heavens, **supplying reverence** to the **Perfected Venerable Scriptures** and the **Saints of the Ten Directions**.\n\nWe **take refuge in body, spirit, and fate**, and with these **meritorious virtues**, we **return to the ancestral spirits** of our family’s past generations—both near and distant, kin and relations, the **shades of the night realm**, the **lingering souls of the departed**, those who dwell in the **lands of the rising sun** and the **boundless seas**, and those who traverse the **realms of Dan and Huo**, the **caverns of Yang**.\n\nWe **embrace the sun and grasp the moon**, **borrowing the force** of **Yin and Yang**;\nWe **mold the soul and cast the spirit**, **restoring the True Form** to the **voids of Li and Kan**.\nWe **attain life’s flourishing realm**, **bestowing blessings** upon future descendants.\n\nNow, as we **offer incense**, we **take refuge in the Perfected Venerable Scriptures and the Supreme Truths of the Saints**. After attaining the **Way**, we shall **ascend to the Formless**, **harmonizing with the True Dao**.\n\n**Practice the chant of the Square**, **confess the chant of the Square**, **command the demons**, and perform **three invocations, three obeisances**. We **request the proclamation of the Dharma Assembly’s ranks**.\n\nWe, **the assembled officials of this hall**, including **Subject [Name]** and all others, **sincerely unite in faith** to **invoke the following**:\nThe **Emperor of Natural Spontaneity and Primordial Beginnings**, the **Perfected Sovereign of the Great Dao**, the **Perfected Lord Lao**, the **Celestial Jade Emperor of the

cultivation among the **mortals of the earth**.\nWith life comes birth, yet who among us **seeks in return** the **One Self**?\n\nThe **unaware** embrace of firm and yielding,\nThe **lonely** birth of vigor and compliance.\n\nLost in origin, forgotten in truth,\nThey stray and err, treading in transgression.\n\nNone awaken to **ascend** in this world,\nYet all receive their **inherent qi** from the **Celestial Balance**.\n\nLament the **embryo’s** first dawn—\nTruly like the **primordial chaos** at its start.\n\nThe **true fire of the alchemical furnace** and the **divine water**,\nForm the **Dan Tian** and **Vermilion Palace** of the human body.\n\nAt the **separation of self**, the **soul congeals** in the day;\nIn the **Kan-Wu month**, the **spirit** is shaped.\n\nThe **six viscera** and **five organs**,\nThe **nine orifices** and **hundred bones**—\nAll **gradually** take form,\nUntil **perfection** and **birth** are complete.\n\nSome grow **wealthy**, some **noble**,\nSome **lowly**, some **poor**—\nEach follows the **emergence of their passions**,\nNone escapes the **world’s entangling snares**.\n\nThe **six desires** veil the **luminous nature**,\nThe **seven emotions** sever the **root of lasting vision**.\n\nHaving **drifted from the Dao** with **growing distance**,\nThey **rightfully** endure the **world’s hardships**.\n\n**Celestial calamities** and **worldly burdens**,\n**Ghostly accusations** and **human blame**—\nThe **celestial cycles** bring **Pisces, Hexagram 23, and Hexagram 24** upon them,\nWhile **misfortune** and **hardship** assail like **summer’s heat and winter’s cold**.\n\nThe **mechanisms of rise and fall** are all hidden in **perilous □**;\nThe **paths of avoidance and pursuit** must be **heeded at the crossroads**.\n\nThe

Ritual of the North-South Dipper Conjunction (Continued)**\n\nThe **Celestial Dipper** ascends to its proper station, the **Five Emperors** rest in reserve.\nThis incense is now burned, humbly paying homage to the **Master and Great Saints**—those who have attained the **Way’s true virtue**.\nAfter attaining the **Dao**, one ascends to the **Formless**, blending in harmony with the **Dao’s true essence**.\n\nThreefold repentance, threefold obeisance.\nThe **Law’s title** is invoked.\nWith sincerity, we—**officiants of all ranks**—prostrate ourselves before the **Natural Void**, the **Primordial Sovereign of the Beginning of Heaven**, the **Supreme Dao Sovereign**, the **Supreme Old Sovereign**, the **Jade Sovereign of the Highest Heaven**, the **Nine Sovereigns of the Highest Truth**, the **Ten Directions’ Great Saints** who have attained the **Dao**, the **Sages of All True Virtues**, the **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Masters of the Profound Law**, the **Venerable

**Native Star of One’s Destiny**, the **Divine Peaks and Oceanic Mountains**, the **Officials of the Three Realms**, and **All True Spirits**.\n\nWe hear that the **Three Luminaries** shine upon the heavens, all things benefiting from their **impartial illumination**;\nThe **Five Deities** descend in radiance, all growth receiving their **encompassing grace**.\n\nThus, the **Southern Pole** governs life’s birth,\nwhile the **Northern Enclosure** presides over death,\noverseeing the grand design and measuring the hidden and manifest.\n\nFrom the **Primordial Chaos** to this very day,\nthe cosmic order remains unbroken,\nthe celestial cycles never err.\nAbove, the **Sovereign Emperor** reigns supreme;\nbelow, all subjects—noble and common—\nstand in dependence upon the **Celestial Master’s** rule,\nrelying upon the **Divine Grace** that sustains them.\n\nYour humble disciple, [Name], has sincerely laid forth his petition,\nwhich has already been fully presented.\nBy the grace of accumulated blessings,\nI have been favored by the **Mysterious Virtue’s** power.\n\nYet the **Six Qi** govern the spirits’ movements,\nwhile the **Five Emperors** refine their natures—\nconstant vigilance is hard to maintain,\nwhile transience and retreat are easily lost.\nDaily, I tread the path of **accumulating merit**,\nyet also step into the realm of **transgressions unrepented**.\nWhether from past deeds or present actions,\nmy offenses are recorded in the **Five Emperors’ ledgers**,\nmy sins inscribed by the **Three Officials’ pens**.\nWithout repentance and atonement,\nthere is no absolution.\n\nMoreover, I fear the **Lunar Mansions’** influences may converge,\nand the **fated years** of my destiny may now be upon me.\nThe years I have lived have passed through **critical junctures**,\nand **calamitous encounters** may soon descend.\nPerhaps I have caused **unintentional harm**,\nor perhaps my **thoughts and deeds** have strayed into evil.\nI have offended the **Heavenly Primordial** above,\nand violated the **Earthly Virtue** below,\ntransgressing the **taboos of Yin and Yang**,\nbetraying the **Divine Light of Sun and Moon**.\nMy sins are vast and boundless—\nwithout sincere repentance and supplication,\nthere can be no forgiveness.\n\nIt is said that the **Southern Palace** governs the **Yang Virtue**,\ngiving rise to all things;\nwhile the **Northern Pole** is the **Hall of Final Judgment**,\ncommanding all spirits.\nLife and death, fortune and misfortune—\nall are recorded under its authority.\nTo remove calamities and resolve crises,\none must truly rely upon the **Sage’s Merciful Grace**.\n\n«Thus I dare to unveil my **vermilion-hearted sincerity**,\nand take refuge in the **mysterious symbols** of the Dao.\nWith devotion, I extend my **sacrificial prayers**,\nand above, I kneel to the **august spirits**,\nlaying bare my heart in the **quiet realm**,\nand revealing my earnestness beneath the **pure altar**.\n\nI humbly hope that the **Six Palaces of the Celestial Mandate**,\nwill descend with their **merciful aid** and **compassionate grace**.\nThe **Seven Heavenly Guardians** of the **Celestial Support** and **Celestial Pass**,\nwill bestow their **compassionate blessings** upon me.\n\nWhen the **Three Clouds** summon the **Divine Chariot**,\nmay it descend upon this dusty world;\nwhen the **Eight Dao** gather their luminous essence,\nmay it bend to bless this sacrificial feast.\n\nMay the **True One** confer its **auspicious retinue** and bestow **divine favor**,\nand open the **great celestial treasury** to prolong **auspicious fortune**.\n\nI specially pray for the **suppression of Heavenly calamities** above,\nand the **warding off of Earthly disasters** below.\nTo dispel the **ill-fated influences** of the **Five Stars, Nine Palaces, and Eight Trigrams**,\nand to resolve the **misfortune** of the **Five Luminaries, Three Celestial Elements**, and **malevolent stars** lurking in darkness.\n\nMay the **Ten Celestial Deities** spare me from the **fear of harmful influences**,\nand the **Mandate** cease its **obstructive punishments**.\nMay the **Residence Spirit** pardon its **divine reprimands**,\nand break the **malevolent ghosts’** **oppressive dominion**.\n\nLet the **Six Heavenly Stems** and **Five Earthly Branches** not suffer **decline and decay**,\nand may the **supporting and opposing influences** of the **stellar palaces** not bring **harmful clashes**.\n\nMay I sever the **invasions of demonic spirits, witchcraft, and poisonous afflictions**,\nand cut off the **plots of evil ghosts and malevolent humans**.\n\nMay the **palaces of the Three Officials** and **Five Emperors**,\n**dismiss all accusations** and **resolve the lingering debts** of my past.\nMay the **souls of the departed and recently deceased**,\nbe **examined and released** from their suffering.\n\nUnder the **protection of the Seven Stars**,\nand within the **auspicious jurisdiction of the Six Records**,\nmay **virtuous blessings** flourish and **disasters** dissipate like mist.\n\nFor all my **six senses’ offenses** and **three acts’ transgressions**,\nand the myriad **thousand sins and ten thousand faults**,\nmay they all be **pardoned and forgiven**.\n\nMay the **Divine Light** guard and protect,\nand the **True Essence** descend in **graceful flow**,\nsafeguarding my **frail and delicate form**,\nand granting me a **longevity of firm and unyielding strength**.\n\nAbove, may I receive the **Heavenly Lord’s** **great compassionate blessings**,\nand below, may I fulfill the **sincerity of my humble petitioners**,\nthus safeguarding this **unveiling of my prayers** to present them.\n\n**Twelve Vows** are made.\nThe **incense burner** is restored.\nI solemnly command the **Incense Officials and their messengers**,\nthe **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Generals**,\nand the **attendant spirits** of the **Incense Assembly**,\nto now order my sincere supplications,\nwhich were uttered in the **stillness of night**,\nto naturally produce **golden elixir and jade-green essence**,\nand **herbs of myriad blessings and spiritual efficacy**.\nMay all the **Sages** gather here at this **incense burner and sacred flame**.\n\nMay it be so that the **Ten Thousand Directions’ Celestial Children and Jade Maidens**,\nattend to the **fragrant clouds**,\nand swiftly convey my **sincerely petitioned words**,\ndirectly reaching the **Ultimate True Dao of the Boundless Supreme**,\nbefore the **Heavenly Jade Emperor, the Great Lord of the Celestial Realm**.\n\n**Hymns of departure** are chanted.\n**Steps from the hall** are taken.\n**Exits the door**.»\n\n「The Grand Compilation of Daoist Rituals and

Precepts Collection* – Master Guangtong Du’s Revised *North Dipper Prolonging Life Pure Ritual Rites***\n\n**On Establishing the Ritual Platform**\n\nShould one who serves the **Supreme Celestial** (上真) fail to align with the **Heavenly Symbols and Earthly Patterns** (法天象地), constructing the platform according to the **Dipper’s Ladle** (随斗杓而建坛), they violate the **Dao’s Teachings** (违道训). It is better not to perform the rites at all than to proceed thus. The ritualist must first purify their **inner realm** (内境), clarifying their **spirit and vital essence** (召魂集神), so that the **Ten Thousand Things** respond to their command and transform in accordance with their will. Only then can their sincerity be manifest—otherwise, though offerings may be abundant, they will yield no benefit. Thus, **invoking the incense** (祝香) must come first.\n\nNext, one must **recite the ritual precepts and teachings** (叙陈科教), for without this, the **Daoist and layfolk** will lack proper cause and effect, and their **faith will wane**, making it difficult for the **Celestial Worthies** to descend. Thus, **reciting the ritual’s purpose** follows.\n\nOnce the purpose is declared, if one cannot **describe the celestial patterns** (纪述天文) and **proclaim the Primordial Mystery** (对扬元妙), they will fail to honor the **Dipper’s Sovereignty** (北斗之尊). Thus, **narrating the Worthies’ virtues** comes next.\n\nAfter recounting the Worthies’ virtues, if no **sincere words** are spoken, sincerity cannot stand. Thus, **proclaiming the invocation** follows.\n\nYet even then, if one’s **petitions for blessings and averting of calamities** are not made with **practiced Dao and vowed aspirations**, placing others before oneself, they cannot align with the **Celestial Intent**. Thus, **offering the three incense** follows.\n\nOnce the incense is offered, one’s **past karmic burdens and grave offenses** must be **repented**. The **Mysterious Virtues and Marvelous Benevolence** must be **striven for**. Without this, sins will not be extinguished, and blessings will not descend. Thus, **repentance** follows.\n\nAfter repentance, one must **contemplate the Seven Celestial Worthies’ Virtues** (七元之德), holding them in mind as if they were present, so that their **auspicious aid may be secured**. Thus, **praising their virtues** follows.\n\nOnce the virtues are praised, one must **take refuge**, exhausting their **sincere aspirations**, so that the **Divine Presence may surely accept them**. Thus, **the Seven Refuges** follow.\n\nAfter taking refuge, one may **offer the coarse wine** (浊醪) as a ritual expression of the heart. Thus, **the three libations** follow.\n\nOnce the libations are complete, the **ritual decorum is fulfilled**, the **gracious blessings obtained**, and the **words of thanksgiving** must be spoken to **send the Worthies back to the void**, while **gazing upward in reverence**. Nothing further can be added, so the **dismissal of the platform** concludes the rites—**a single phrase suffices**.\n\n---\n**The Invocation of Incense**\n\n*\"Dao Incense, Virtue Incense, the Incense of Effortless Naturalness*—now burning in the heated censer—**I summon the Three Treasures of the Great Luo, the Jade Seal Celestial Sovereigns, the Golden Gate Jade Emperor, the Central Heavenly Star Sovereign of Purple Micro, the Native Star Sovereign of the Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper, and all the Celestial Worthies of the Encompassing Heavenly River and Constellations.**\n\nWith this **true incense**, I **universally offer reverent homage**.\n\nI, **your humble disciple of the [Surname] household**, now **proclaim the ritual precepts and practice the Dao**, petitioning for blessings and averting calamities. First, I shall **recite the ritual’s chapters and extol the virtues**, so that within this **ritual platform**, both **Daoists and layfolk** may witness and hear, and all generate **reverent devotion**.\n\nI **humbly pray for celestial favor**, seeking even a slight alignment with the **Heavenly Will**. It is proper to **lay this out in detail**; I pray you **deign to inspect it with favor**.\n\nI have heard that the **Most High established Virtue**, setting forth the **lofty winds of purity and stillness**; the next was to **establish Teachings**, expounding the **marvelous scriptures of compassion**.\n\nThey compiled the **Daoist canons**, hiding them in **sacred mountains**, sometimes revealing their traces to **deliver beings**, or bestowing **ritual precepts to save the world**.\n\nThey **detailed the cycles of the Lower Primordial** and **expounded the causes of one’s native star**, opening the way for all people to **take refuge in the Great Dao**, so that they might **cultivate the heart and nourish the qi**, confess sins to **prolong life**, and at the **times when Celestial Worthies descend**, always **grant sincere prayers**.\n\nAt the **Three Primordial Festivals and Eight Seasonal Nodes**, at one’s **native star’s birth hour**, they **solemnly established the ritual platform**, **reverently observing fasts and pure rites**, whether in **temple halls or domestic settings**.\n\nThey held **various incense and flowers**, offering them with **sincere devotion**; they arranged **fragrant wines and fruits**, their **virtues shining bright**. They **modeled the rites after Heaven and Earth**, **embodying the decorum of awe** in their offerings.\n\nWhen observing fasts, they **extended from one day to seven**, according to their **capacity to perform merit**; when commissioning the Dao, they **gathered from one person to seven**, inviting them to **conduct the rites**.\n\nSome **recited the numinous spells**, others **acknowledged the true forms**, directing their hearts to the **Dipper’s Sovereignty**, bowing beneath the **Purple Micro**, **humbling themselves before the Three Officials and Five Emperors**, **reaching sincerity to the Nine Palaces and Four Departments**, **offering blessings to prolong life**, **dissipating calamities and warding off misfortune**, **broadening boundless blessings**, and **receiving the greatest of celestial favor**. They **pondered the True Worthies’ unerring will**, **avoided false sects**, **purified the decay of calamities**, **shared in the dissolution of sins**, **attained virtuous fruits for the body**, and **secured blessings and longevity for life**, **ascending to the Ten Extremes**, **never sinking into the Three Abysses**. All this is the **power of invocation**, none other than the **support of the Worthies’ virtues**.\n\nYet there are those of the **Lower Primordial** born into lands afflicted by **epidemic scourges**, where **plagues spread**; or years struck by **famine and scarcity**, where **harvests fail and goods are not produced.**\"\n\nThe corpses lie sprawling across the plains, the *qi* congealing beneath the vaulted heavens. Many face the specter of famine and hunger, while lands are ravaged by blade and war.\n\nIn reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, expressing mortal sincerity and chanting divine incantations—thus summoning the **Thunderous Spirit’s** might to the earth. We deploy **celestial chariots** across the four quarters, cast nets a thousandfold, and unleash **flaming arrows** ten thousand *li* far. We gather the **five demonic weapons’** malevolent *qi* and ensure the **five grains** flourish in harmony. The year shall rejoice in abundance, and the people shall know no untimely death.\n\nYet there are those of the **Lower Primordial** afflicted by sudden calamities, where pestilence and miasma cannot be evaded, and they often encounter the **Six Cavern Demons**, suffering countless torments. Their homes are plagued by misfortune, and they know no rest. Disaster and decay lurk, seizing them at their most vulnerable. Their vital breath is bound, and chronic illness ensnares them for long. Some wander in hardship, others are choked by debt. Their fortunes show signs of decline, their lives lack smooth prosperity—calamities multiply beyond description.\n\nIn reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, presenting our mortal pleas and chanting divine incantations—thus augmenting **divine insight** and **fate’s calculations**, trimming death’s register while extending life’s. Demonic scourges are dispersed, and all undertakings bring auspicious fortune.\n\nYet there are those of the **Lower Primordial** whose fields are ravaged by **locusts and borers**, whose lands teem with **plague insects**, destroying crops and leaving no harvest. Though they yearn for abundance, they reap nothing.\n\nIn reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, solemnizing the fields with ritual purity and arraying the **threatening implements** in order. Following the **science**, we recite the incantations and dispatch petitions to the heavens—thus invoking the **Thunderous Spirit’s** stern command to slay the **disaster insects**, nurturing the **grains** to double their yield.\n\nYet there are those of the **Lower Primordial** who pray for descendants at their gates, whose women bear the joy of pregnancy. Some suffer within the **Six Hexagrams**, their fetal *qi* damaged; others perish within the **Ten Years**, their lives cut short. On the critical day of their pregnancy, they encounter the **Demoness’s** calamity, harboring malevolent *qi* that cannot be preserved, consuming the **essence of life** without securing it. They suffer from **withering yellow sickness** and are plagued by **strange dreams**—cats, mice, dogs, and monkeys transform into ominous forms, secretly devouring their offspring, leading to frequent deaths and deepening the sorrow of their parents, severing the lineage of their ancestors.\n\nIn reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, expressing mortal sincerity and chanting divine incantations—thus moving the **Thunderous Spirit** of the upper realms to descend as the **Jade Maiden**, guarding the inner chambers and harmonizing the **five viscera**, ensuring the **auspiciousness of childbirth** and the **longevity of life**.\n\nYet there are women who labor in childbirth with agonizing pain, their suffering caused by the **Ghost Mother’s** devouring, weakening their **blood and viscera**, obstructing them for over a decade in endless terror.\n\nIn reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, performing the **Way** with utmost sincerity and reciting the incantations—thus summoning the **Spirit Boy** to descend alongside the **Jade Maiden**, safeguarding the **grass mat** of childbirth in peace and ensuring swift, smooth deliveries for both mother and child.\n\nYet there are women who, as **tiger-wolf consorts**, consume the **essence of their children’s viscera**, desperately seeking sons yet bearing none in their lifetimes.\n\nIn reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, purifying the hall with solemnity and offering **incense and flowers** in abundance, focusing our hearts on **single virtue** and reciting the incantations ten thousand times—thus sweeping away demons and banishing evil, ensuring **abundant progeny**.\n\nAll these **divine responses** are recorded in the **Precious Scrolls**. Thus it is known that the **Nuns’** atonements and the **Seven Primordials’** salvation encompass all.\n\nThis is the **Most High’s** expedient means, the **Most Holy’s** compassionate mercy, their **sincere devotion** for the people and **wholehearted benevolence** for all things. If one purifies the heart with fasting, presents humble pleas, prepares the rites with meticulous words, and invokes their wishes—what desire shall not be fulfilled, what petition shall not be granted?\n\nNow, I, **[Name Redacted]**, pondering deeply and reflecting earnestly, bathe in **virtue** and purify my body, dedicating my intent to the **True Science** and aligning my heart with the **Mysterious Way**. I establish this **altar platform**, modeling it after the **vault of heaven**, adjusting the **celestial measurements**, lighting the **lamp of the Dipper**, reverently presenting the **law of faith**, and solemnly preparing **incense and flowers**, inviting the **Celestial Drivers** to descend and witness the **mortal’s** sincere prayers.\n\nWith deepest reverence, I now set forth this **preliminary exposition**, expounding the **True Function**, declaring it to all officials, that they may follow the **law’s instruction**, examine their intentions, and redouble their diligence. May this move the **Thunderous Spirit**, accomplish the **merit**, and then proceed according to the **rites**, continuing with the **petitions**.\n\nWe, the mortals, are overwhelmed with awe at the **Dao’s power**, the **divine light’s** descent, the **spirit’s** soaring brilliance, and the **urgent, protective** grace.\n\n*[End of Volume Fifty-Five]*\n*[Beginning of Volume Fifty-Six]*\n*Dao

**transgress Heaven and defy Earth**,\nharming life and violating the **Dao**,\nneither **Dao-compliant** nor **benevolent**,\nneither **loyal** nor **filial**.\nWe indulge the **Six Emotions** in chaos,\nand align with the **Six Thieves** in delusion—\ndisrespecting **teachers and scriptures**,\nenvying the **virtuous and good**,\ntaking joy in disaster,\nand greedily clinging to

without restraint,\nand **revel in cruelty** as my skill.\nI **slander the good** and **obscure the virtuous**,\n**defy Heaven and Earth**,\n**pursue licentiousness** and **amass evil**,\n**luxury and

(本命上属北斗某星君) descends.\nThe **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper** (北斗七星),\nLocated north of **Taiwei** (太微, the Pleiades),\nSymbolize the **sovereign of humanity** (人君之象),\nAnd serve as the **master of commands and orders** (号令之主).\nThey **measure the primordial *qi*** (斟酌元气),\n**Oversee the four directions** (临制四方),\n**Establish the four seasons** (以建四时),\n**Balance the five phases** (以均五行),\nAnd **govern the central flow of Heaven and Earth** (运天地之中),\nWhile **human life is derived from them** (人禀之以为命).\n\nThe first is **Star of Yangming and Greedy Wolf, the Great Star** (阳明贪狼太星君), governing those born in the **year of the Rat** (子).\nThe second is **Star of Yin Essence and Great Gate, the Primordial Star** (阴精巨门元星君), governing those born in the **years of the Ox and

components of human nature and life** (凡人性命五体),\nAre all under the dominion of the **native star officials** (本命星官之所主掌).\nThe **native star generals and officials** (本命神将、本宿星官),\nConstantly **bestow their auspicious shade** (垂荫佑),\n**Oversee human life** (主持人命),\nAnd **ensure the preservation of one’s Heaven-bestowed years** (使保天年).\n\nThe **True Saints of the Native Star** (本命真圣),\nEach year descend **six times** (每岁六度) to the mortal realm.\nThe day of descent is the **critical period of one’s native star** (本命限期),\nWhen one may **plant various incense and flowers, fresh seasonal fruits** (种种香花、时新五果),\n**Model oneself after Heaven and Earth** (法天像地),\nAnd **invite Daoist priests of the Orthodox Unity School** (请正一道士);\nEither at **temples and observatories** (宫观),\nOr within **domestic settings** (家庭),\nTo **establish ritual halls and perform expiatory rites** (修斋设醮),\nAnd **invite and pray to the Northern Dipper’s Three Officials and Five Emperors** (启祝北斗三官五帝、九府四司),\nPresenting **two petitions: one for bestowing blessings, the other for dispelling calamities** (荐福消灾二奏章恳愿),\nAnd **fulfilling merits according to one’s capacity** (随力建功),\nTo **conduct the ritual affairs** (请行法事).\nThe **merits and virtues** (功德) are profound and weighty;\nTheir full extent cannot be enumerated (不可具陈).\n\nFor those whose **native star’s critical period** (本命限期) is approaching,\nYet who **do not know** (自身不知),\nAnd **do not set up ritual halls or perform incense rites** (不设醮筵，不修香火),\nUnable to **inform and pray to the Northern Dipper** (不能投告北斗),\nOr **thank the True Sovereigns** (醮谢真君),\nNor to **recite and transmit the True Scripture** (转真经),\nAnd **acknowledge the name of their native star’s True Sovereign** (认本命真君名号),\nThis is **reckless disregard for life and ignorance of one’s roots** (轻生迷本),\n**Disdaining the human body** (不媿人身),\n**Causing Heaven’s officials to strip one’s fortune** (天司夺禄),\n**Reduce one’s lifespan and subtract one’s years** (减算除年),\nAnd **result in many untimely deaths** (致多夭丧).\n\nAfter **expressing gratitude to the native star** (身谢之后),\nOne falls into the **three abysses** (三涂, the three lower realms),\nAnd **drifts through the six paths** (漂诸六趣, the six realms of rebirth),\nA state deeply **worthy of lamentation and sorrow** (深可悲哀),\n**Self-inflicted suffering** (自致斯苦).\n\nToday, as disciple **某** (某) establishes this ritual,\nWe reflect upon the **day of our native star’s descent** (本命之日),\nThe **beginning of receiving our form from *qi*** (禀气受形之始),\nAnd the **source of our transformation and birth** (化生之本).\n\nThe **Daoist teachings on the Great Cavern of the One** (道家大洞帝一之法),\nAll emphasize **cultivating and refining the spirit** (练神),\n**Gathering *qi* to preserve life** (结气保命),\nOn the **day of one’s native star** (皆以本命之日).\n\nThe **method of generating the True and transmitting it to others** (生真诵度人之法),\nAlso requires **cultivating and preserving the soul-spirit** (行持魂神),\n**Purifying and rectifying the ten thousand *qi*** (澄正万炁),\nSo that one may **long retain the roots of one’s native star** (长存则知本命之根本),\nAnd **never pass over this day in vain** (不可虚过).\n\nToday, all gathered in this **Daoist ritual hall** (道场),\nShould know that **Heaven’s command is most weighty** (天命至重),\nAnd **cannot be lightly prayed for** (不可轻祷).\nThough we **wear the badge of the Most High Perfection** (佩至真),\nAnd **participate in the Great Dao’s cultivation** (参修大法),\nOur **bodies dwell amidst the five impurities** (处身五浊),\nAnd our **traces are stained by the six dusts** (染迹六尘),\nYet even in **presenting our

welcoming the **Sacred Procession**.\n\n**The Saint is invoked.**\n**First Offering.**\n**Flower-Sprinkling.**\n\n**Law-Position is proclaimed again.**\n\nWe, the **officiating disciples of such-and-such rank**,\nHumbly and sincerely petition:\nThe **Three Pure Ones of Highest Holiness**,\nThe **Celestial Jade Emperor of Highest Heaven**,\nThe **Thrones of All Heavens**,\nThe **Three Treasures’ Divine Lords**.\n\nWe have heard:\nThe **Six Jia** are tamed within,\nFollowing the **mechanisms of fate’s balance**;\nThe **Five Phases** succeed in cycles,\nMarking the **tortoise-and-bird omens**.\n\nWithin the **three hundred and sixty decades**,\nAll **seventy-two seasonal shifts** are recorded.\nA **year’s cycle** is ruled by **one star**—\nExamine the **shift of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches**,\nAnd the **hidden correspondences of geomancy** unfold.\n\nUpon the **Emerald Tower’s Hall**,\nThe **consuming-disaster text** was spoken in the **Year of the Horse (丙午)**;\nWithin the **Jade Bureau’s Seat**,\nThe **prolonging-life secret** was revealed in the **Year of the Sheep (乙未)**.\n\nThe **Years of the Tiger (丁丑), Rabbit (丁卯), and Snake (丁巳)**—\nThe **Jade Maiden** presides;\nThe **Years of the Rat (甲子), Tiger (甲寅), and Monkey (甲申)**—\nThe **Three Sovereigns** govern.\n\n**Lord Guan** met the **Most High** at **noon on a Gengwu day**,\n**Ge Xuan** received the **Celestial True One** at **night on a Jingyin day**.\n\nThus it is known:\nWhen the **Native Star’s hour arrives**,\nThe **hundred spirits** gather.\n\nThe **officiating disciple of such-and-such name**,\nWith **incense and flowers as offerings**,\nFirst **aligns the body in sincerity**.\nGazing upon the **North Dipper’s Celestial Pole**,\nThey **direct the heart in petition**;\nStanding at the **ritual’s incense-table**,\nThey **focus the mind on the august spirits**.\n\nThe **First Offering’s rites** are completed,\nAnd the **Heavens’ and All-Heavens’ Saints** descend in rank.\n\nTo **honor the gods**, we value **virtue**, not **flavor**—\nMay we drink the **fragrance of Illuminated Virtue**;\nTo **sacrifice to Heaven**, we seek **substance**, not **form**—\nHoping to **transmit sincere and earnest prayers**.\n\n---\n\nWith heartfelt words and earnest petition,\nWe open this **Red Character’s** scroll,\nSummoning your **Purple Clarity’s** shade.\n\nWe beg for the **gale’s swift return**,\nTo behold our **solemn oaths**—\nThe disciple’s **green petitions** now unfold.\n\n**Proclaimed words** are declared:\nWith **devout sincerity** clearly seen,\nWe seek **Original Command from Heaven**,\nAnd solemnly perform the **science of rites**.\n\nTo preserve the **nature of the Sage-born**,\nWe eternally honor the **august spirits**.\n\nMay the **Supreme Saint** descend with grace,\nThe **Virtuous Sovereign** turn with favor.\nWithin arm’s reach, the **Celestial Capital’s** chariot arrives,\nThe **True Companions** gather in solemnity;\nWith **composed bearing**, the **Celestial Truth** descends,\nTheir **serene faces** radiant and dignified.\n\nWe station the **Celestial Ritual’s** array,\nAnd convey our **sincere devotion** to the **Imperial Hearing**.\n\nMay the **divine response** align with our prayers,\nAnd the **subtle omens** manifest—\nGranting **auspicious responses** in secret.\n\nDaring to seize this **Original Command’s** moment,\nWe pray for **Heaven’s universal blessings**.\n\nWe, the disciples and ritual officers,\nWith boundless joy and reverent exultation,\nProstrate ourselves in awe,\nAnd humbly present the **Second Offering**.\n\n**Scatter flowers.**\n\nWe, the humble officials of such-and-such rank,\nWith united sincerity, petition:\nThe **Northern Dipper’s Imperial Seat**,\nThe **Seven Stars of the Dipper’s Core**,\nThe **Five Blessings and Ten Gods**,\nThe **Twenty-Eight Constellations**,\nThe **Encircled Heavens’ Celestial Luminaries**,\nAll **august spirits**.\n\nWe have heard:\n**Fate is decreed by Heaven**—\nWho does not rely on the **Great Creator’s** work?\nThe **Northern Dipper** truly governs all beings.\n\nFrom the **Great Polarity’s** emergence,\nThe **Three Lights** shone in succession—\nThe **Dipper’s Handle** above,\nCalled the **Imperial Chariot**, moving at the center.\n\nIt alone holds the **Symbolic Measure’s** exalted rank,\nTurning the **Heaven and Earth** with precision;\nIts **subtle transformations** work in mystery,\nBestowing **life’s essence** upon all beings.\n\nThe **radiant light of a single star**,\nGoverns the **fates of ten thousand folk**.\n\nThe ritual officer of such-and-such name\nRemembers his **Original Nature’s** source,\nReflecting on the **beginning of his birth**—\nHis **Command** was opened first,\nAnd his **form** was nurtured today.\n\nHe fears the **ancestors’ past delusion**,\nAnd dreads the **Heavenly Lord’s** punishment for neglect.\n\nHe solemnly sets the **Daoist Ritual’s** feast,\nAnd renews the **offerings’ rites**.\n\nIncense curls in **auspicious mist**,\nDivine lamps gleam with **sacred light**.\nThe **Law’s sounds** resound,\nThe **Celestial Ritual’s** steps are orderly.\n\nAt the **Heavenly-Human convergence**,\nThe time of **blessings and fortunes descending**,\nThe **spiritual contract** is fulfilled—\n**Supreme sincerity** moves the divine.\n\nMay our **lifespan extend**,\nOur **domain of longevity** boundless;\nMay we be **granted divine felicity**,\nAnd our **foundation of blessings** forever firm.\n\nThe **Seven Thousand Gods of the Northern Dipper** guard and protect,\nThe **Three Thousand Officials of the Southern Mound** follow in attendance,\nSweeping away **disasters and obstructions**,\nDispelling **demons and malevolent spirits**.\n\nThe **Five Visceral Gods** ever preserve,\nThe **Three-Life Men** endure forever.\n\nFor women, it is said:\n**Preserving the form** is supreme—\nNone may depart from the body.\n\nThe **Imperial Seat’s** radiance flows,\n**Heavenly Essence** scatters its hues—\nEach guards their **constellation’s station**,\nTogether storing **auspicious fields**.\n\nWe, the disciples and ritual officers,\nWith utmost **devotion and trembling reverence**,\nProstrate ourselves in awe,\nAnd humbly present the **Final Offering**.\n\n**Scatter flowers.**\n\nWe, the humble officials of such-and-such rank,\nWith renewed sincerity, petition:\nThe **Five Sacred Peaks and Ten Mountains**,\nThe **Three Rivers and Four Seas**,\nThe **Ten Isles and Three Lands**,\nThe **Four Great Waters and Nine Rivers**,\nThe **Blessed Earths and Tranquil Abodes**,\nThe **Cavern Heavens and Sacred Transformations**,\nThe **Three Bureaus’ Official Administrations**,\nAll **mighty and spiritual beings**.\n\nWe have heard:\n**East, the Morning Star shines; West, the Long Regard**,\n**South, the Basket Weave; North, the Dipper stands**.\nGazing upward at the **Celestial Patterns**,\nTheir **resplendent and dazzling** marks appear—\nThese **Seven Stars**, each one\n**Inspiring life’s fundamental source**.\n\nThey **emanate supreme purity** beyond form,\nAnd **direct the Great Creator’s** work in Heaven.\n\nRecognizing the **star of our Original Command**,\nWe set the **Spiritual Treasure’s** rites to the **True**.\n\nThis is to **know one’s roots**,\nAnd thus **not treat life lightly**.\n\nThe disciple of such-and-such name,\nAt the **auspicious hour’s selection**,\nNow **formally presents** the **clear offerings**—\nYet fears that though his **intent is self-exhorted**,\nHis **conduct may not align with the Dao**.\n\nHe **clears his mind of distractions**,\nTurning toward virtue and away from guilt;\nHe **consults the Celestial Maps’** paths,\nSeeking the **Way** and pursuing **spiritual efficacy**.\n\nHe **deepens his pure intentions**,\nHoping for the **spirits’ repeated blessings**.\n\nNow the **ritual is strictly observed without cessation**,\nAnd the **three offerings** are fully completed;\nThe **mysterious responses** have already communicated—\nMay we **preserve a hundred years of eternal life**.\n\nWe humbly hope the **Three Pure Ones** bestow their gifts,\nAnd the **Ten Directions’ High Worthies** shower their light.\n\nMay the **roots of sin be extinguished**,\nSo we may **reverently receive the sacred luminaries**;\nMay the **Great Auspicious Assembly** be restored,\nAnd **never fade from human life**.\n\nLet the **three calamities and four killings** be dispelled,\nThe **five afflictions and six harms** removed—\nWithout the **Seven Injuries**, yet under the **Seven Celestial Protectors’** guard,\nWithout the **Eight Difficulties**, yet under the **Eight Heavenly Observers’** watch—\nMay husbands and wives **preserve their lifelong union**,\nMay men and women **know the joy of family**,\nMay women **avoid childbirth’s misfortune**,\nMay ghosts **no longer entangle** the living,\nMay all **diseases be cured**,\nMay **epidemics spare us**,\nMay **evil spirits be subdued**,\nMay **wolves and tigers hide**,\nMay **official disasters and lawsuits** be forever erased,\nMay the **Earthly Nets and Heavenly Snares** dissolve,\nMay our **associations lack curses and slander**,\nMay our **travels be free from bandits and robbers**—\nTogether in our homes,\nAll may **attain peace and well-being**.\n\nWe, the disciples and ritual officers,\nWith **uttermost piety and solemn vigilance**,\nProstrate ourselves in awe to report.\n\n**Proclaim the Merit and Virtue Sutra.**\n\nWe, the humble officials of such-and-such rank,\nWith **renewed sincerity**, petition:\nThe **Three Pure Ones and Supreme Saints**,\nThe **Ten Extremes’ High Worthies**,\nThe **Ocean-Mountains’ Spirits**,\nThe **Heavenly and Earthly Celestials**,\nThe **Three Realms’ Officials**,\nAll **mighty and spiritual beings**.\n\nWe humbly establish the **Clear Science**,\nAnd **solemnly proclaim the fragrant offerings**.\n\n**Ascending to the Celestial Pole**,\nWe **pay homage to the Vermilion Palace’s** august might;\n**Inviting the True Spirits**,\nTheir **jade light** shines in the **void**.\n\nWe **three times draw the pure nectar**,\nAnd **once present our supplicating words**—\n**Overseeing from on high**,\nOur prayers **lack no response**.\n\nWe reflect:\nThe disciple of such-and-such name\nHas no other **affections**—\nOnly **virtue** he cultivates,\nHearing and **acting without delay**,\nAnd **ritual fasting** he holds supreme.\n\nWhen the **auspicious hour** arrives,\nAnd the **Original Command** draws near,\nThe **evening’s spiritual platform** opens,\nAnd the **six degrees of clouds** descend in pairs.\n\n**Imperial Clarity** now illuminates,\nAnd **karmic obstructions** vanish—\n**Separately extending Heaven’s Palace’s** fate,\nAnd **never severing humanity’s seed**.\n\nMay we **flow with True Qi**,\nAnd be **nourished by Great Harmony**,\n**Shine with Mysterious Light**,\nAnd be **bathed in Divine Dew**—\nSo that the disciple of such-and-such name\nMay **gradually ascend to wondrous fruit**,\nAnd **reestablish the Mysterious Merit**,\n**Attaining the Dao’s emptiness**,\nAnd **possessing perfect penetration in sagely wisdom**,\n**Soaring in the Purple Clouds’ realm**,\n**Ascending through the Golden Gate’s door**,\n**Harmonizing with the Ten Thousand Saints**,\n**Transcending the Three Realms** in freedom,\n**Forever free from the Wheel of Rebirth**,\nWith **lifespan boundless**—\nSilently speaking of the **Dao’s path now opened**,\nAll beginning **from this very day**.\n\nNext, I humbly pray that the seven ancestral spirits of my disciple’s family may ascend,\nAnd the nine generations of ancestral rites be honored in the realm of the departed.\nMay they bathe in the **Hall of Flowing Fire**,\nAnd walk the path of **Zhu Ling’s Palace**.\n\nRiding the **Qi of the Cavernous Yang**,\nThey receive the **Record of the Three Pure Ones**;\nFree from the **multitude of ghosts**,\nThey depart the **bends of the spirit springs**.\n\nSuffering is forever severed,\nAnd toil is no longer heard—\nTheir blessings extend to future generations,\nAnd their lineage’s fortune is prolonged.\n\nNext, for parents, brothers, sisters,\nHusbands, wives, sons, and daughters—\nAll sins and blemishes are cleansed,\nAnd all receive blessings and protection.\n\nThe **Purple Register** records their virtues,\nIncreasing their fortune and rank before the **Jade Emperor’s ledger**;\nThe **Yellow Ledger** marks their deeds,\nInscribing their names in the **Great Imperial Hall above**.\n\nAll within the household receive their grace,\nAnd a hundred generations share in their blessings.\n\nMay the **Nine Sovereigns’ calamities** be removed—\nThough punishments strike, they cause no harm;\nMay the **Two Celestial Cycles’ misfortunes** be averted,\nAnd their years instead grow longer through cosmic void.\n\nThe young and old live in peace,\nAnd the clan remains harmonious.\n\nNext, I pray for the **sword to rest and punishments to cease**,\nAnd the **Dao to spread pure and refined**.\nMay great celebrations fill the land,\nWithout the calamity of **overturned caps**;\nMay divine blessings descend upon the people,\nAnd songs of praise return to the heavens.\n\nLet the **mixed teachings of chariot and scripture** be unified,\nAnd the heavens and earth be steadied in peace.\nThe **Nine Suns** are tempered to six,\nControlling the **Eon’s cycle** without worry;\nThe **Four Celestial Assistants** govern a thousand officials,\nHonoring loyalty and repaying the state.\n\nLet boundless grace extend to all things,\nAnd duties be bestowed upon all ministers.\nAll who dwell beneath the **covering canopy**,\nShare in the harmonizing transformation of like-minded hearts.\n\nNow, the **heavenly fragrance lingers in the air**,\nAnd the **celestial guards are returning**—\nThe **Immortal Children** bear the scepter in advance,\nAnd the **Cloud Chariot** ascends with the wind’s swiftness.\n\nThe disciples of the **True Class** have retired,\nAnd the **fasting rites are complete**—\nWe have already received the **Heaven’s favor**,\nAnd forever share in the **harmonized sacred period**.\n\nYour disciple and the disciples who conducted the **rites of expiation**,\nWith deepest longing and gratitude,\nHumbly present this petition.\n\n**Twelve Wishes fulfilled.**\n**The furnace is restored.**\n\nWith reverence, I command the **Fragrance Officials and Envoys**,\nThe **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**,\nAnd the **Attendant Spirit Officials**—\nThat in the place where I have formerly practiced in quiet nights,\n**Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** will naturally arise,\nAlong with **Immortal Mushrooms and Hundred Spirits**,\nAnd the **multitude of True Ones** will gather here before the incense furnace.\n\nMay I pray that the **Ten-Directional Immortal Children and Jade Maidens**\nAttend the **Lantern Smoke**,\nAnd swiftly convey my sincere petition\nTo the **Most High, Supreme, and Limitless Dao of the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign** before the **Heavenly Court**.\n\n**Recite the Praise at the Hall’s Exit.**\n**Depart the Door.**\n\n**The Complete Daoist Ritual Standards, Volume 62 concluded.**\n**The Complete Daoist Ritual Standards, Volume 63**\n*For the Three Caverns Scripture and Ritual Disciples, Composed by Zhong Li*\n**The Grand Ritual of True Martial’s Responsive Virtue (真武灵应大醮仪)**\n**The Auspicious Sovereign Ritual (佑圣醮仪)**, in three editions:\n1. *Qianyao Chao’s* hidden and radiant version,\n2. *Master Shi’s* great edition,\n3. A recently compiled edition.\n\nAll are single-day rituals, lacking the full observances of night and day. Now, these three editions are merged, incorporating the *Du Tianxiang’s* Northern Emperor’s Ritual from *Guangting*, with the two *San Shang Xiang* (Three Upper Incense) sessions interwoven, expanded into *Qǐsàn* (ritual invocation and dismissal), and structured into three periods of practice, forming five volumes for ritual use.\n\n**Ascending the Platform’s Ritual Procedures** follow the prescribed order.\n\n**Courtly Attendance (Tíngcān):**\nWith humility, we, the positioned disciples, burn the **Dao-Qi (Way-Qi) incense**, **Virtue incense**, and **Non-Action-Natural incense**, and with sincere devotion, bow twice to petition:\nThe **Law-Lord, North Pole Pacifying Heaven True Martial Responsive Auspicious True Lord (北极镇天真武灵应佑圣真君)**,\nThe **Dark Heaven Primordial Holy Benevolent and Mighty Sovereign Emperor (玄天元圣仁威上帝)**,\nThe **Holy Father, Pure Joy King (圣父净乐国王)**,\nThe **Holy Mother, Virtuous Victory Empress (圣母善胜皇后)**,\nThe **North Pole Tianpeng Marshal of the Celestial Hosts, Azure Heaven Sovereign Emperor (北极天蓬都元帅苍天上帝)**,\nThe **North Pole Tianyou Vice-Marshal, Vermilion Heaven Sovereign Emperor (北极天猷副元帅丹天上帝)**,\nThe **North Pole Yìshèng Preserving Virtue True Lord, Azure Heaven Sovereign Emperor (北极翊圣保德真君昊天上帝)**,\nThe **North Pole Officials Ranked Beneath the Celestial Gate (北极阙下列班真宰)**,\nThe **Three Great Marshals of Thunder and Lightning—Deng, Xin, and Zhang (雷霆邓、辛、张三大元帅)**,\nThe **Two Marshals of the Thunder Gate—Gou and Bi (雷门苟、毕二元帅)**,\nThe **Two Host Deities of Xuwei (虚危二宿神君)**,\nThe **Black Tiger Great God Liu Tianjun (黑虎大神刘天君)**,\nThe **Fufu Deities and the Four Heavenly Lords—Cui, Lu, Deng, and Dou (阜纛神君、崔、庐、邓、窦四天君)**,\nThe **Four Great Marshals—Ma, Zhao, Guan, and Wen (马、赵、关、温四大元帅)**,\nThe **City Deities and Temple Spirits (城隍祀典，庙社神祇)**,\nThe **Three Realms’ Functionaries (三界功曹)**,\nThe **Oath-Keeping True Officials (证盟真宰)**—\nAll are summoned by the **True Incense**, universally honored with offerings.\n\nWe, the disciples, humbly reflect:\nThe **Round Canopy’s pure brilliance**—\nA refined qi, untainted by smoke;\nThe **Northern Spirit’s manifest response**—\nA harmonious time for celestial descent.\n\nWe purify our hearts, uphold the fast’s precepts,\nAnd with reverence, perform the **Courtly Attendance rites**,\nAspiring to invite the **Imperial Dao’s sojourn**,\nExhausting our sincerity, renewing our earnest petitions.\nWith utmost devotion, we prostrate and take refuge.\n\n**Issue the Edict.**\n**Recite the Spell and Sprinkle Purification.**\n\nThe **Dao of Heaven** is lofty and distant,\nWithout sound or scent that can be heard;\nThe **Divine Response** is profound and unfathomable,\nYet only the **Yin and Yang** remain unmeasured.\n\nWhere sincerity is directed, the response is boundless.\nThus, the **Spiritual Officials** are capable of conveying petitions.\nWe dare to offer the **fragrance of a single incense burner**,\nAnd humbly invite the **Four Celestial Rectifiers’** sacred might.\n\nWe hope to be granted **spiritual communion**,\nAnd that **inspection and approval** may soon descend.\nNow with this incense, we solemnly summon\nThe **Year-Rectifier Functionaries**,\nThe **Month-Rectifier Functionaries**,\nThe **Day-Rectifier Functionaries**,\nAnd the **Hour-Rectifier Functionaries**,\nOnly wishing for their descent to receive our humble entreaties.\n\nWe, the disciples, reverently acknowledge:\nThe **Four Celestial Rectifiers** are the most **exalted and supreme** among all directions;\nThey traverse **ten thousand li** without pause,\nNor do they linger for an instant.\n\nBy **jade gates and golden courts**, their commands are transmitted,\nAnd they oversee the **knocking at the threshold**;\nWith **cloud chariots and wind steeds**, they pass through the capital,\nAs dense as **journeying through the celestial realms**.\n\nWe rely on the **Holy Power’s** swift conveyance,\nTo reach the **Divine Hearing’s** fourfold expanse.\nIf our prayers are **precise and clear**,\nThey shall never face obstruction or delay.\n\nNow, this **Dao Ritual Official** of humble virtue,\nFrom birth endowed with **auspicious connections**,\nHas encountered the **True Dao**,\nAnd with **morning and evening incense**, dares not forget the **True Sage’s** boundless grace;\nWith **seasonal offerings and reverent devotion**, seeks to align with the **Spiritual Officials’** swift descent.\n\nWe humbly pray that the **Divine Presence** may descend to inspect,\nAnd that all who dwell in this age may witness\n**Auspicious mists ascending to the heavens**,\n**Blessed winds and rains upon the earth**,\n**Jade scripts unfolding on emerald tablets**,\n**Sacred sincerity emanating from crimson hearts**,\nTo rely on the **preceding entreaties**,\nAnd achieve **harmonious ascent**,\nThat our prayers and petitions may be **granted and heard**.\n\n**Issue the Edict.**\n**The previous edict has been properly sealed and submitted.**\nNow, we **unfold the rituals** in the **mortal realm**,\nAnd **dispatch our sincerity** to the **mystic domain**,\nThough our deepest contemplations may not reach above,\nWe **invite the descent** on this **auspicious day**,\nDaring to disturb the **Highest Spirit’s** hearing.\n\nWe humbly pray that the **Rectifiers** may **convey our words**,\nThat our **endeavors may succeed**,\nOur **petitions be fulfilled**,\nOur **exorcisms repel evil**,\nOur **actions bear fruit**,\nAnd that this **modest sincerity** may not be in vain.\n\n**Recite the Precepts.**\n\nWe reverently acknowledge:\nThe **True Martial Spirit of the North**—**Lord of Sacred Response**—\nIs the **manifest form of the Highest Venerable Lord**,\nAssociated with the **Sixth Star of the Northern Dipper**, **Mars**,\nWho governs **Military Conquest**.\n\nIn the North, the **constellations of Xu (虚)** and **Wei (危)** are likened to **serpents**,\nAnd the **stars of Yingshi (营室)** and **Dongbi (东壁)** to **tortoises**.\nThe **tortoise** bears a shell to **defend itself**,\nThe **serpent** forms an array with **head and tail both present**,\nThus embodying the **symbol of martial prowess**.\nWhen the **tortoise and serpent unite**, they become the **True Martial Spirit**,\nWith **Divine Sovereignty**—this is the **True Lord in Heaven**.\n\nHe wears the **Azure Jade Crown**,\nAnd robes of **dark hues**,\nTogether with **Tiānpéng (天蓬)**, **Tiānyòu (天猷)**, and **Yìshèng (翊圣)**,\nKnown as the **Four Celestial Saints of the Northern Pole**.\n\nDescending to the **human realm**,\nHe **loosens his hair and goes barefoot**,\nWields a **sword to sever heresy**,\nAnd commands the **Six Ding (六丁)** and **Twelve Jade Maidens (玉女)**,\nThe **Eight Killing Generals (八杀将军)**,\nThe **Six Celestial Guardians (六甲直符)**,\nThe **Twelve Divine Generals (十二神将)**,\nEach with **twelve attendants**,\nAnd **clerks bearing talismans**, numbering **one hundred and twenty**,\nWith **divine soldiers**, **five hundred million strong**,\nAnd the **deities of thunder, lightning, wind, and rain**,\nWho always accompany him.\n\nThe **True Lord** often descends in **Sichuan**,\nAs **Sichuan** has the **County of Mysterious Tortoise** (玄武县).\nNow, to avoid the **Sacred Ancestor’s** name,\nIt is renamed **Zhōngwāng (中汪)**.\nFrom the **Han** to the **Sui**, it was under **Chéngdū (成都)**.\nIn the **third year of Emperor Wǔdé’s reign (武德三年)** of the **Tang**,\nIt was divided and placed under **Zǐzhōu (梓州)**.\nThe county boasts the **most sacred traces of the True Lord**,\nLeaning against **high mountains**.\nThe **mountains above and below** all have **temples**,\nFacing the **great river**.\nThe **river’s stones** naturally form the **shape of tortoises and serpents**.\n\nIn recent times, there were **no Daoists maintaining the temples**,\nSo it became the **Golden Immortal Daoist Hall (金仙道场)**,\nAnd the **sacred might** still frequently **manifests**,\nEven descending with **divine messages** to **Chéngdū**.\nAt the **beginning of the Song dynasty’s rise**,\nThere was a **Li surnamed Jiāohuī (燂灰李)** in **Chéngdū**,\nWho established a **single incense burner** to worship the **True Lord’s** sacred fire.\nThe **True Lord descended** to his household,\nAnd bestowed upon him **five measures of sacred scriptures**,\nWhich were **passed down through generations**.\n\nThere was also **Dù Míng (杜明)**,\nWho was **diligent in his reverence**,\nAnd the **True Lord often descended** to speak with **Míng**.\n\nDuring the **Xiánpíng era (咸平中)**,\n**Wáng Jūn rebelled**,\nAnd the **bandit leader sent soldiers** to summon **Míng**.\n**Míng went** to see the **rebel commander**,\nYet **unbeknownst to him**, his mouth **uttered the True Lord’s sacred words**.\nThe **rebel commander ordered him sent back home**.\nAfter some time, **Míng’s family realized he was still at home**,\nAnd the whole household was **overjoyed**.\nAfter the **rebels were pacified**,\n**Míng** **exhausted all his wealth** in offerings to the **Three Treasures of Tiānqìngguān (天庆观)**,\nSelected a **site to build the foundations**,\nConstructed **halls and pavilions**,\nAnd **sculpted the True Lord’s image**,\nAs well as **portraying the Spiritual Officials and their attendants**,\nTo **repay the debt** for escaping the **rebel’s calamity**.\n\nOn the **Festival of the Upper Element (上元节)**,\nWhen the **halls and pavilions were newly adorned**,\n**Crowds of visitors gathered**.\n**Dù Míng** had passed away,\nAnd his **brother struck the ritual gong**,\n**Arranging the incense and lamps** with utmost reverence.\nBy night, **scholars and commoners filled the hall**.\nHis **brother**, at the **silk screen window**,\n**Watched the calamitous women**...\n\nThe True Lord, in his wrath, caused [his own] eyes to nearly burst.\n\nIn the year **Xiángfú (祥符)** the fifth,\nHe again descended with words:\n*\"If Tiānpénggē (天蓬哥) arrives, he will be the guest,\nAnd I shall be the host to welcome him.\"*\nNumerous times, the **Highest True Ones (上真)** descended thereafter.\n\nOne day, while **Míng** was paying homage with incense and fire,\nThe True Lord descended with words, commanding him to summon **Daozhèng Míng**,\nthe **Master Jìng of Chán (寒道冲)**, saying:\n*\"I have descended here for several years.\nLater, I shall descend in the **Eastern Capital (东都)** to safeguard the **imperial lineage (帝祚)**,\nAnd you must not abandon your earlier resolve.\"*\nFrom that time onward, he no longer heard the True Lord’s voice,\nUntil ten years later, when the **tortoise and serpent (龟蛇)** appeared at the **Holy Water Temple (圣水观)** in the capital,\nAs if confirming the prophecy.\n\nIn the late **Chóngníng (崇宁)** period,\n**Jìtáng (纪堂)** of **Chéngdū (成都)** excelled in both **martial prowess (力学)** and **literary skill (能文)**.\nThe **Língshòu Temple (圣寿寺)**’s **Liú family (刘氏)** ordered their descendants to follow him in study.\nThe True Lord descended with words:\n*\"Jìtáng is unfilial to his stepmother,\nAnd the **Celestial Register (天曹)** no longer accepts his name.\nLater, he will achieve nothing—\nHe will die in exile at the **medicine stall (药水铺)**.\"*\n\nAt the beginning of **Jìngkāng (靖康)**,\nWhen the capital fell,\nThe True Lord again descended in **Chéngdū**.\n\n**Yáng Guǎng (扬广)**, a **Cháoqǐng Láng (朝请郎)**,\nDue to **malicious influence (祟害)** harming his daughter,\nCame to the **Yùjú Observatory (玉局观)**,\nAnd established a **Four Saints Ritual (四圣醮)**.\nThe True Lord descended upon the seat,\nAnd the entire observatory was struck with awe—\nThe True Lord dispelled the **malicious influence** for him.\n\nThen, when he inquired about the **ancestral deeds (祖先以来事)** of the **ritual officers (斋官)** and others,\nThe True Lord **witnessed them with his own eyes (目击)**.\n\nHe also requested the **Jiāngshān Spirit King (江读神王)**,\nWho arrived in response at once.\n\nThe **Earthly Officials (地司主者)** tremble in fear below the steps and obey your command.\n\nIn the **Jiànníng (建炎)** era,\nAt the **Cháo Dū (广都)** nest observatory,\nHe dreamed that the **True Lord (真君)** sent someone to summon him,\nHis heart filled with great dread.\n\nUpon arrival, the **True Lord descended the steps (降阶)** to greet him,\nWith a **divine countenance (圣颜)** warm and gentle,\nAnd a **refined voice (玉音)** clear and bright,\nTreating him as an honored guest.\n\nAwakening, he thus devoted himself to **establishing the ritual (修醮仪)**,\nAnd his entire household **observed the precepts (奉戒)** with ever greater sincerity and reverence.\n\nThe reason for these offerings is that one must not **treat them lightly (轻媟)** from the very beginning of the **ritual foundation (建斋)**.\nYou should know these precepts—there are seven in total.\nAll must listen carefully.\n\nThe **First Precept (第一戒)** is this:\nOne must not **place faith in false Dao (邪道)**,\nOr **invoke demonic rites (祷祭魔法)** and **beg for extra blessings

Incense:\n\n「谨摄香官使者、左右龙虎君、侍香诸灵官，当令臣向来静夜行道之所，自然生金液丹碧，芝英百灵，众真交会，在此香火炉前。」\nWe solemnly gather the *Xiangguan* [香官] messengers,\nThe *Longhu* [龙虎] Lords of left and right,\nAnd the *Shixiang* [侍香] spirits of incense attendance;\nOn the nights of our ritual practice,\nMay golden elixirs and emerald nectars spontaneously arise,\nAlong with herbs and sacred plants of myriad virtues,\nAnd all the True Ones convene before this incense burner.\n\n「当愿十方仙童玉女，接侍兰烟，传臣向来所启之诚，速达径御至真无极大道、昊天玉皇上帝御前。」\nWe wish that the celestial youths and maidens of the Ten Directions,\nAttending to the fragrant incense,\nMay swiftly convey our sincere petitions\nDirectly to the *Zhen* [至真] *Wujing* [无极] Great Dao,\nAnd to the *Hao Tian* [昊天] *Yuhuang* [玉皇] Emperor of Heaven.\n\n「出堂颂。」\nDeparting the Hall, we chant:\n\n「出户。」\nExiting the Door.\n\n**The Complete Daoist Ritual Precepts, Volume 64 completed, Volume 65 begins: The Three Caverns Scripture and Ritual for the Disciple Zhong Li’s Cultivation of

[真武] *Lingying* [灵应] True *Jun* [君],\nThe responsive deities of the Three Realms,\nAnd all True spirits.\n\nI have heard that yin and yang alternate in succession,\nAnd that the north alone bears the *Taiyin* [太阴] Dao *Qi* [炁];\nThat water and fire wax and wane in their own vigor,\nYet only the True *Jun* [君] embodies the essence of water’s position.\nHe governs the *Kan* [坎] officials of administration,\nAssists the *Chenji* [宸极] in cosmic functions,\nAnd completes the beginning and end of all things—\nOverseeing the unfolding and contraction of transformative forces.\nHe aids the Emperor of Heaven in his *Taojin* [陶钧] crafting,\nAnd encompasses the vital mechanisms of all spirits.\n\nSometimes he soars within the vast heavens,\nSometimes he lingers in the Five *Qi* [炁] realms,\nHis banner raised as the seas and mountains tremble,\nHis sword *Qi* [炁] surging as clouds and thunder resound.\nThe *Qin* [祆] mists are swept away by lightning,\nHis commands carried forth by the wind’s swift flight.\nAll who turn to him in reverence\nShall receive his manifest blessings.\n\nI have purified the *Dantan* [坛度] platform,\nAnd await the wind’s final descent.\nWith earnest devotion, I humbly receive his grace,\nAnd stand in awe of the spirit’s transformative power.\n\nHaving received the sacred words,\nHow dare I not present them above?\n**Proclamation of Words**\nThe words are carefully examined,\nTheir sincerity clearly seen.\nWithout relying on his luminous might,\nHow could I attain the *Jian* [戬] *Gu* [谷]?\nI pray to be offered the *Pingfan* [苹蘩]’s sacred guidance,\nSo that I may follow Heaven and Earth’s benevolent will.\n\nFrom the layered heavens, his auspicious *Qi* [炁] descends,\nA shower of *De* [德] *Zi* [泽];\nThrough all the realms, his spirit winds fan forth,\nBroadly spreading waves of mercy.\nNo spirit shall dare to offend,\nNor shall any ghost accuse!\n\nAt this pure dawn of the Dao’s practice, I respectfully invite the assembly of the Law to take these first three strands of incense and offer them upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the Palace of Supreme Clarity, nourishing the manifested body of the Venerable and Responsive True Martial Sage, the Golden Gate Lord Lao, and the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor of the Highest Sovereignty.\n\nI humbly pray that the Great Dao may descend its benevolence in splendor, crowning the ranks of the Perfected with its auspicious grace, so that frontier beacons may shine brightly, blades may fall silent, and in court there be no ministers who deceive the sovereign or betray the state, while throughout the lands officials may govern with love for the people and loyalty to the realm. May there be no more bandits or rebellions, and may all enjoy the peace of *Shengping*.\n\nNow, having offered this incense, I take refuge in the Virtue of the Great Sage, the Perfected Assembly of the Most True. After attaining the Dao, I shall ascend to the Formless and harmonize with the True and the Way.\n\nAt this pure dawn of the Dao’s practice, I respectfully invite the assembly of the Law to take these next two strands of incense and offer them upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the Northern Pole Bureau of Eternal Rites, nourishing the Venerable and Responsive True Martial Sage’s subordinate, the Star Lord of the Martial Chord, and the assembly of the Northern Pole Saints.\n\nI humbly pray that you manifest your wondrous responses to spread far and wide, shining your sacred radiance afar, so that the officiant, this humble one’s ninth-generation ancestor seven generations back, may not be delayed at the nether gates. May my living father, now departed, be freed from all guilt. May the burdens of past-life enmity be severed, and the cries of ancestral lawsuits in the underworld be silenced. May the spirits of malevolent demons be bound, and the ghosts of the Six Peaks be beheaded. May the vast *Hongfan* qi be restored, and this people be eternally protected.\n\nNow, having offered this incense, I take refuge in the Virtue of the Great Sage, the Perfected Assembly of the Most True. After attaining the Dao, I shall ascend to the Formless and harmonize with the True and the Way.\n\nAt this pure dawn of the Dao’s practice, I respectfully invite the assembly of the Law to take these final three strands of incense and offer them upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the Divine Seat, nourishing the Venerable and Responsive True Martial Sage.\n\nI humbly pray that you embody the Golden Gate’s resplendent might, serving as the primordial minister of the Jade Capital, patrolling with decisive authority, cutting off all inauspicious omens, so that the officiant, this humble one of the *Kan* mansion, may be freed from perilous calamities and endowed with the enlightened nature of Water’s virtue. May he, who has long studied the Cloud Research Scriptures with profound mastery and unmatched eloquence, swiftly ascend to the honors of officialdom, then stride upon the lofty path of prosperity. May he who lacks such study possess a firm Daoist root and a keen, luminous nature, so that in all his comings and goings, no external evils may cling to him, and in his rest and nourishment, no temporal illnesses may afflict him. May disasters melt away like ice, and blessings grow ever longer as the sun. May he who holds office flourish in his career, distinguished by his lofty virtue, swiftly receiving the honor of promotion to perilous posts, ascending to the favor of the exalted, so that the seas may look to his statesmanship and all officials may revere his weighty bearing.\n\nNow, having offered this incense, I take refuge in the Virtue of the Teacher-Sage, the Perfected Assembly of the Most True. After attaining the Dao, I shall ascend to the Formless and harmonize with the True and the Way.\n\nWith renewed reverence, the humble official, this one, along with the assembled officiants, sincerely presents this petition to the Supreme Without Extremes, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Jade Emperor of the Highest Sovereignty, the Nine Sovereigns, the Ten Directions Without Extremes, the Supreme Spirit-Treasury Heavenly Venerable, the Perfected Saints who have attained the Dao, the Assembly of the Most True, all Revered Lords and Masters, the Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures and the Mystic Great Master of the Central Dao, the Northern Pole Auxiliary Saint, the Venerable and Responsive True Martial Sage, the Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits, and all True Essences.\n\nI have heard that the mist of the Immortals drifts through the layered stages, granting those of worthy virtue the chariot of timely ascent; that the sacred grounds are opened with pure offerings, where the solemn rites are arranged in strict order. I have exhausted my humble devotion, relying on the divine presence to scrutinize me.\n\nYet, reflecting deeply, this humble officiant’s grasp of the Dao is shallow, his birth fraught with hardship, and he has recklessly burdened the workings of Transformation without benefiting the enlightened age. Navigating the world’s paths, he has endured countless perils, his name obscured by dust. He has always feared becoming one who toils diligently at the start but grows slack at the end, or who walks the world with many faults and few merits, or whose lifespan is not long, or whose foundation is not deep.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when the Supreme One expounds the Scriptures, and on the third day of the third month, when the Venerable Sage descends, my rites of offering have been deficient, and I have truly fallen into dread. In the years *Jiazi* and *Gengshen*, my prayers were sparse; to the Seven Elements and Four Saints, my reverence was delayed. I have dwelled in filth as my norm, partaken of meat and spice without restraint, approached the dying and the dead, and followed worldly customs, observing evil winds. Some have sought fleeting honors, indulging recklessly and bringing ruin upon their ancestors; others, relying on a single family’s wealth, have grown arrogant and licentious, incurring guilt before the underworld officials. There have been those who, without law, coveted wealth, or who, violating the Dao, sought advancement through improper means.\n\nAll these transgressions I now abandon, hoping to restore the divine favor. I humbly pray that you condescend to examine my sincerity, broadly extending the shelter of the Dao, so that this officiant’s household may flourish, with blessings and longevity ever increasing, his descendants multiplying and thriving, his spouse and he aging together in harmony, his granaries ever full and his gold and silk ever abundant. May he forever dispel unforeseen disasters and eternally preserve boundless life.\n\nThis disciple, this humble official, reflects once more: righteousness and heresy cannot coexist, and good and evil cannot walk together. Because the teachings of virtue have declined in the age, the ghosts of night have grown rampant. Those who revere the Dao are few, while those who believe in heresy are many. Due to the greed of the common folk, desiring sudden wealth for their households, they fawn upon wasteful spirits, plundering their neighbors, gorging on blood in their starving bellies, and displaying monstrous transformations in the night. Some hurl tiles and stones from emptiness, while others, taking advantage of the dark, steal wealth. Some mock the spirits of the dead, and often the deceitful nature of ghosts is exposed.\n\nThis disciple, this humble official, further reflects: some harm the young and innocent, while at times they manifest as terrifying seizures and convulsions. Others blow upon the mouth to create sounds and call out people’s names, or knock upon doors and pound on gates to disturb their dwellings. Some scatter filth in chaotic disorder, while others linger around food trays, feasting without restraint. Some send false dreams in sleep to deceive, or summon the departed to wreak havok. Others display wealth to win favor, or set fires to cause alarm.\n\nIndeed, these most vile **Xie Dao** (邪道) heresies thrive in the mortal world. Without fail, I shall uncover all secrets, and I pray to ride upon the **Liuhuo Bell** (流火之铃) to strike. No crime shall go unpunished, and I shall spare no retribution, even if it be as vast as the **Great Heaven’s** (巨天) execution.\n\nI shall carry out the **Taishang’s** (太上) command and uphold the **Zhenjun’s** (真君) authority. Let no land dare to withhold its offerings—first, I shall dispatch the **Yin soldiers** (阴兵) to slay and behead.\n\nI shall cut off the hundred heresies’ (百邪) rampant harm and deliver all beings to safety and peace. With the **Magu** (魔精) spirits extinguished and the **Huosi** (火死) flames reduced to ash, disasters shall vanish like clouds dispersing and mists scattering.\n\nMay all hearts reverently pray, and may this humble offering be their refuge. Above, I honor the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** (天尊) boundless compassionate grace; below, I align with my officials’ sincere devotion. I respectfully submit this petition.\n\n**The Twelve Vows** (十二願).\n**Reverently Rekindle the Furnace** (复炉).\nRespectfully, I command the **Fragrant Officials and Messengers** (香官使者), the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Generals** (左右龍虎君), and the **Attendant Spirits of Incense** (侍香諸靈官): they shall cause this humble official’s offerings, made at the dawn of each clear day, to spontaneously produce **Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** (金液丹碧), **Herbs and Spirits of a Hundred Kinds** (芝英百靈), and gather all the **Perfected Ones** (衆真) at this furnace of incense.\n\nMay the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Youths and Jade Maidens** (十方仙童玉女) attend to the fragrant vapors and swiftly convey this humble official’s petition to the **Supreme Ultimate Great Dao’s** (無極大道) and the **Celestial Jade Emperor’s** (昊天玉皇上帝) presence.\n\n**Exit the Hall and Proclaim** (出堂頌).\n**Exit the Door** (出戸).\n\n**The Complete Daoist Ritual Canon, Volume Sixty-Six**\n*Three Caverns Scripture and Talisman: Disciple’s Vows of Aspiration*\n**The Grand Ritual of True Martial’s Responsive Virtue (真武灵应大醮仪)**\n\n**At the Hour of Wu (临午行道):**\nThe ritual ascends the platform as prescribed.\nEach pays homage to the Master in accordance with the law.\nThe **Sacred Guards’ Incantations** (卫灵咒) are proclaimed:\n\n**To the Northern Void, the Dark and Mysterious Lord (玄天杳杳神君):**\nWith myriad transformations, the **Mysterious Tortoise’s Perfected Spirit** (玄武灵真) unfurls—\nAscending the heavens, overturning the earth, driving thunder and dispersing clouds.\nWith legions numbering ten thousand, sweeping away the miasma of demons.\n**Thunder Lords** attend, **Jade Maidens** command—\nGhosts and spirits cower, dragons and tigers flee in haste.\nThe Five Peaks tremble, all spirits obey.\nThe **Celestial Bell and War Drum** resound, traversing heaven and earth.\nHunting rogue ghosts, shattering demonic souls,\nExpelling evil and aiding the righteous—\nThe **Dao-qi** ever ascends, harmonizing with the True.\n**The Law-Drum is struck twenty-four times.**\n\n**The Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin-qi (三炁),**\nThe **Most High Dao Lord (太上道君),**\nThe **Most High Laozi (太上老君),**\nSummon forth from within this humble servant:\nThe **Three Five Functionaries (三五功曹),**\nThe **Left and Right Officials and Messengers (左右官使者),**\nThe **Left and Right Incense-Bearers (左右捧香),**\nThe **Relay Dragon Cavalry Clerks (驿龙骑吏),**\nThe **Attendant Golden Boys (侍香金童),**\nThe **Speech-Bearing, Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens (传言散花玉女),**\nThe **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans (五帝直符),**\nThe **Direct-Day Incense Officials (直日香官)—**\nA total of **Thirty-Six** emerge.\n\nThose who depart are adorned in solemn, radiant attire,\nTheir headgear and sashes trailing ribbons.\nThey open the **Void Altar’s Land and Domain Spirits (玄坛土地),**\nThe **Territorial Deities and Perfected Ones (方域神真).**\n\nAt this hour of Wu, as the ritual commences,\nThis humble servant respectfully petitions to declare intent:\nWith sincerity unshaken, already recorded and reported,\nMay the **Most High’s Ten Directions’ Perfected Dao-qi (十方至真道炁),**\nThe **Sacred Treasure’s Auspicious Light (灵宝瑞光),**\nDescend and flow into this humble servant’s body,\nThat what is petitioned may swiftly reach the presence of\nThe **Most High’s Supreme Ultimate Dao (無極大道)**\nAnd the **Celestial Jade Emperor (昊天玉皇上帝).**\n\n**The Law-Position is invoked.**\nThis humble servant of such-and-such rank, together with the assembled officials,\nSolemnly and sincerely petition above:\nTo the **Most High’s Supreme Ultimate Dao (無極大道),**\nThe **Primordial Heavenly Venerable (元始天尊),**\nThe **Most High Dao Lord (太上大道君),**\nThe **Most High Laozi (太上老君),**\nThe **Most High Celestial Jade Emperor (太上昊天玉皇上帝),**\nThe **Nine Sovereigns Most Exalted (九皇上尊),**\nThe **Ten Directions’ Supreme Ultimate (十方無極),**\nThe **Most High Sacred Treasure Heavenly Venerable (太上灵宝天尊),**\nThe **Already Dao-Realized Great Saints (已得道大圣),**\nThe **All-Perfected Spirits (衆至真),**\nThe **All Noble Lords (諸君丈人),**\nThe **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Scripture Masters of the Mysterious Middle (三十六部尊经玄中大法师),**\nThe **North Pole’s Auxiliary Saint, True Martial’s Responsive Perfected Lord (北极佑圣真武灵应真君),**\nThe **Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits (三界应感),**\nAnd **All True Spirits (一切真灵).**\n\nThis humble servant has heard:\nThat which sustains life and origins,\nAll things derive from the **Two Principles (二仪).**\nWith **righteousness and wisdom (有义有知),**\nHumans are the most enlightened of all creatures.\nThe **Nine Heavens unite in virtue (九天合德),**\nThe **Three Caverns manifest form (三洞化形).**\nThe **Three Myriad Six Thousand spirits** all come to guard and assist,\nThe **Three Hundred Sixty bones and joints** are all harmoniously connected.\n\nYet, through **obstinate delusion and false paths**, the True is obscured;\nThrough **deep-rooted malevolence**, goodness is blotted out.\nWhen the **cycles of yin and yang are exhausted,**\nAnd the **eons of great and small calamities conclude,**\nDemons proliferate, cutting short humanity’s allotted span;\nSeeking false blessings, all fall into **perverted, foolish ignorance.**\nThey do not reflect upon their **original nature**—\nFollowing **evil paths**, they suffer **confusion and chaos,**\nLacking **loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness.**\nThough not yet their destined time of death,\nThey are struck down by the **Six Heavens’ injuries and killings;**\nSudden loss of life brings forth **the grievances of the multitudes.**\nThe young and old do not fulfill their natural years,\nTheir souls drift, bereft in the mortal realm.\nThus, the **impure qi** swirls in tangled knots,\nWhile the **True One’s form** finds no refuge.\n\nTo alleviate the **lower realm’s suffering and distress,**\nWe rely upon the **True Martial’s Divine Lord (真武神君).**\nSevering demonic essences, rescuing lost souls,\nWe wield the **Compassionate Sovereign’s might,**\nCommanding **ten thousand armies,**\nTo slay demons and exterminate evil—\nThus the **Four Quarters are purified,**\nThe **Three Lights shine pristine,**\nThe **True Law flourishes,**\nThe **Evil qi dissipates,**\nRestoring **peace to the world,**\nDissolving the **people’s doubts,**\nBringing **eternal tranquility to all nations,**\nSilencing the **Nine Abysses’ accusations.**\nThe **Divine Function’s grace** extends,\nReliance upon it spans **ten thousand eons.**\n\nThe **Ritual Disciple**, though unworthy, has long partaken of the **True Shade (真荫),**\nYet dwells in the dusty world.\nEver contemplating **auspicious deeds of virtue,**\nDedicated to the **rites of the True.**\nAs a humble grass-and-thatch mortal,\nOnly harboring **loyal devotion;**\nAs a fleeting ant’s life,\nEver grateful for **the river’s flow of grace.**\nDrowned in the years of neglect,\nUnable to repay this light—\nThus, at this **auspicious hour of the Holy Dew’s birth (诞圣涓吉辰),**\nA **Ritual of Welcoming Auspiciousness (迎祥之醮)** is specially established.\nWith **Daoist companions**, we humbly thank the **Northern Spirit (北灵),**\nRevering the **Supreme Symbol’s Exalted One (上象之尊),**\nDaring not to neglect the **Square Enclosure’s petition (方函之奏).**\nThough the **sincere words may follow ancient forms,**\nThe **divine principles defy full comprehension—**\nOur **devout supplications** arise from **precise intent.**\nMay the **whirlwind’s swift passage** pause,\nAnd the **Heavenly Sovereign** look down upon this **crimson sincerity.**\nThis disciple’s **green petition** shall be duly presented.\n\n**The Petition is Proclaimed:**\nAs the words declare, the sincerity is profound and devoted.\nGazing back upon the **Five Clouds’ Seat,**\nWhere **Hundred Harmonies’ smoke ascends,**\nThe **Heavenly Emperor and Perfected Ones** gather,\nAs at the **Upper Primordial Hall (上元之殿);**\nThe **Northern Capital’s Sovereign** leads,\nAdvancing toward the **Eight Scenic Palaces (八景之宫).**\nThe **Lofty Pavilion stands solemn in the void,**\nThe **Celestial Music drifts ethereal in the Azure Void (碧落),**\nThe **Perfected Ones attend in ranks,**\nThe **Demons bind their forms in submission—**\nHow dare we not **exert utmost sincerity,**\n**Reverently prostrate in devotion,**\nHoping to receive the **Heavenly Sovereign’s favor,**\nThat **the family and nation may prosper.**\n\nAt this hour of Wu, as the ritual commences,\nWe request the **Law-Assembled** to kindle the **first incense-twist,**\nThat this **incense-smoke may ascend directly to the Pure Clarity Palace (太清宫),**\nOffering to the **True Martial’s Responsive Perfected Lord’s manifested form (真武灵应真君所化之身),**\nTo the **Golden Threshold’s Laozi (金阙老君),**\nTo the **Three Pure Ones Most Holy (三清上圣),**\nAnd the **Jade Emperor (玉皇上帝).**\n\nThis humble servant **surrenders body, spirit, and fate,**\nAnd with this **incense-twist’s merit,**\nWe pray for the **Current Emperor’s blessings:**\nMay his **virtue spread across the Eight Seas,**\nHis **lifespan equal the Two Principles (二仪).**\nLike the **glory of sun and moon,**\nIlluminating without end;\nMay his **boundless virtue encompass heaven and earth,**\nCovering all beneath the vault of heaven.\n\nThe hundred affairs are in order, the three borders at peace,\nA thousand spears laid aside, all bearing children return home.\nThe year’s bows and hooks are hung away,\nMountain paths open of their own accord.\nIce-silk divine beasts cross the seas to our gates.\nAll living things move with vitality, all ascend to benevolent longevity.\n\nNow, we burn incense to return and take refuge in the **Dao-Honored Great Saints’ Most Authentic Virtue**.\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend into the Formless,\nHarmonizing with the True and merging with the Way.\n\nWith today’s midday ritual, we request the **Law-Assembled** to kindle the **second incense-twist**,\nThat this incense-smoke may ascend directly to the **Northern Pole’s Eternal Office (北极太常府)**,\nTo offer to the **True Martial’s Responsive Perfected Lord’s subordinate, the Martial Chord Star Lord (武曲星君)**,\nAnd the **Northern Pole’s Sacred Assembly**.\nWe surrender body, spirit, and fate,\nAnd with this incense-twist’s merit,\nWe dedicate to the **certain household of the Dao’s transmission**—\nNine generations of divine rites,\nA hundred million ancestral spirits,\nFreed from endless night, ascending to behold the radiant light.\nShining in the **Court of the Vermilion Dan**,\nAscending to the **Palace of Piercing Brightness**,\nWith celestial robes gleaming in splendor,\nOur names inscribed in the **Immortal Registers**,\nBestowing blessings upon descendants,\nPartaking in the **True Celestial Realm**.\n\nNow, we burn incense to return and take refuge in the **Sutra-Honored Great Saints’ Most Authentic Virtue**.\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend into the Formless,\nHarmonizing with the True and merging with the Way.\n\nWith today’s midday ritual, we request the **Law-Assembled** to kindle the **third incense-twist**,\nThat this incense-smoke may ascend directly to the **Divine Seat**,\nTo offer to the **True Martial’s Responsive Perfected Lord**.\nWe surrender body, spirit, and fate,\nAnd with this incense-twist’s merit,\nWe dedicate to the **certain household of the Dao’s transmission**—\nSix kinships and nine clans,\nAll relations bound by fate,\nAll attaining auspicious connections,\nEver under the Dao’s protection,\nSecretly dispelling guilt and calamity,\nSilently resolving disasters and entanglements,\nDebts and lawsuits settled in harmony,\nGrudges and enmities reconciled.\nWicked men and malevolent ghosts lack schemes to harm;\nDark omens and black talismans avoid their doomed influence.\n\nThe **Divine Seat’s True Martial** bestows protection and auspiciousness in all actions.\nWith today’s incense-burning, we humbly dedicate ourselves to the **Law-Assembled**’s **True Martial’s Responsive Perfected Lord**—\nThe **Virtue/Power of the Supreme True**,\nWhich, after attaining the **Dao/Way**, ascends to the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao/Way’s True Essence**.\n\nWe repeat the **Law’s sacred rank** in earnest.\n**Official Certain** and the **Assembled Officials of the Ritual Platform**, with sincere devotion, jointly petition:\nThe **Supreme Way of the Limitless**, the **Heavenly Sovereign of Primordial Beginnings**,\nThe **Supreme Lord of the Great Dao**, the **Supreme Sage of the Lao**,\nThe **Supreme Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heavenly Sovereign**,\nThe **Nine Sovereigns Above**,\nThe **Ten Directions of the Limitless**,\nThe **Supreme Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure**,\nThe **Perfected Saints of the Dao** who have already attained the **Dao/Way**,\nThe **Assembled True Martial of the Supreme Law**,\nAll **Responsive Perfected Lords**,\nAnd the **True Spirits of the Three Realms**.\n\nWe, the **Officials**, have heard of the **Responsive Perfected Lord’s** miraculous birth and deeds,\nAnd we beseech guidance from the **Wondrous Practices**;\nWe, the **Officials**, have heard of the **Wicked Qis** stirring up calamities,\nAnd we pray to sever and remove the **Malevolent Spirits** that once relied on the **Responsive Perfected Lord’s** **威神** (awe-inspiring spirit).\n\nIn the **endless age**, we fear the **proliferation of disasters**,\nAs the **host of demons** grows ever more rampant.\nThey dare to raise **noxious qi**,\nDisturbing the **virtuous folk**;\nThey seek to **purge and cleanse**,\nYet only deepen the **suppressed grief** of the people.\n\nThe **Officials** humbly reflect:\nBeneath the **urban settlements and suburbs**, the **malevolent spirits** take refuge;\nBetween the **mountains, rivers, forests, and valleys**, the **precise souls** dwell.\nSome cling to **thin groves and sparse clusters**,\nOthers roam freely in the **sandy shallows**.\nWith **wind howling and rain shrieking**, they raise **grievous cries** across the **four wilds**;\nWhen **clouds gather and moonlight wanes**, they emit **phosphorescent flames** in the **midnight hours**.\nIf one encounters these **wicked ones**, one’s **true life** will surely be harmed.\nSome fall into **ravines and gullies**,\nOthers meet **blades and axes** at the **sharp edge**.\nSome **leap into fire or wade through rivers**, acting in **madness or epilepsy**;\nOthers **endure bitterness and swallow acidity**, forever haunted by **fear and dread**.\n\nThe **Officials** deeply dread that all **living beings of the world** may suffer such torments,\nAnd we earnestly hope the **Perfected Lords** will not betray their **vows**,\nBut **unfurl their numinous might**,\nDriving these **malevolent demons** back to **emptiness and stillness**,\nSo that **heaven is clear and earth is tranquil**,\nAnd they **forever cease to prey upon the innocent**—\nTogether with all **living beings**, we rejoice in this **great aspiration**.\n\nThe **Officials** further reflect:\nIn the **realm of ghosts**, the **crafty and domineering** tread upon **palaces and courts** in empty wanderings;\nThe **malevolent and cunning spirits**, unrestrained, **spread delusion and deceive the living**.\nSome **nest in lofty towers and pavilions**,\nOthers **dwell in mountain forests**.\nWhen **night grows dark**, their **lanterns flicker and flames blaze**;\nIn **desolate wilderness**, their **reeds and pipes** play in **chaotic return**.\nThey **spread their foul qi**, secretly **stealing treasures and hoarding wealth**.\nThey **bring calamity to the people**, demanding **sacrifices of wine and blood**;\nThey **boast false strength**, able to **snatch the souls of the young and vigorous**.\n\nIf one encounters these **wicked ones**, one’s **true life** will surely be harmed.\nSome **suddenly shift from poverty to wealth**, only to **lose it all again**;\nOthers **gain fortune, then swiftly perish**.\nThey **roam without rest**, exploiting the **prayers of the greedy**;\nThey **assault without cease**, leading to **ruin and decline of the body**.\n\nThe **Officials** deeply dread that all **living beings of the world** may suffer such torments,\nAnd we earnestly hope the **Perfected Lords** will not betray their **vows**,\nBut **unfurl their numinous might**,\nDriving these **malevolent demons** back to **emptiness and stillness**,\nSo that **heaven is clear and earth is tranquil**,\nAnd they **forever cease to prey upon the innocent**—\nTogether with all **living beings**, we rejoice in this **great aspiration**.\n\nThe **Officials** further reflect:\nIn the **lakes, rivers, and seas**, there are **cryptic dragons, hidden crocodiles, aged turtles, and giant tortoises**,\nWhose **spirits** lurk in the depths.\nIn the **woods, groves, and mountains**, there are **wild boars, long serpents, venomous insects, and fierce beasts**,\nWhose **kinds** dwell in the wilds.\nThey **ride the waves’ dangers**, swiftly **swallowing ships whole**.\nThey **await the sound of footsteps**, then **harbor poisonous intent**.\nSudden **disasters arise**, and **death comes in an instant**.\nIf one encounters these **wicked ones**, one’s **true life** will surely be harmed.\nSome **are crushed beneath the **pine forests and ravines**,\nOr **buried in the depths of the fish’s belly**,\nOr **consumed by foul qi**, their **bodies swelling with thunderous pain**;\nOthers **are devoured by ferocious beasts**, their **bodies drained and bones exposed**.\n\nThe **Officials** deeply dread that all **living beings of the world** may suffer such torments,\nAnd we earnestly hope the **Perfected Lords** will not betray their **vows**,\nBut **unfurl their numinous might**,\nDriving these **malevolent demons** back to **emptiness and stillness**,\nSo that **heaven is clear and earth is tranquil**,\nAnd they **forever cease to prey upon the innocent**—\nTogether with all **living beings**, we rejoice in this **great aspiration**.\n\nThe **Officials** further reflect:\nIn **Sichuan**, they say the **world’s ghostly pits** are here,\nIn the **southeast**, the **lands of Jing and Min-Yue** teem with **venomous insects and malevolent spirits**.\nThe **wilds of mountains and forests**, the **fields and villages**,\nAre plagued by **malevolent shamans** who **work their tricks**.\nThey **hurl flying talismans and sprinkle cursed water**,\n**Cutting mouths and burning bodies**,\n**Pointing at the void with curses**—\nAnd indeed, one **hears of unjust deaths**,\nWhile the **spirit lingers within itself**, only to **be seized and imprisoned**.\nThey **desire to taste the sacrificial broth**, yet **midday brings harm from blood-sucking demons**;\nThey **raise their iron rods**, and one **suddenly falls stiff and lifeless**.\n\nIf one encounters these **wicked ones**, one’s **true life** will surely be harmed.\nSome **whistle all day long**,\nOthers **remain in a stupor for years**.\nSome **fall into madness without cause**, mistaking **empty flowers** for companions;\nOthers **groan silently in darkness**, struck by **sudden violent illness** and **dying in haste**.\n\nThe **Officials** deeply dread that all **living beings of the world** may suffer such torments,\nAnd we earnestly hope the **Perfected Lords** will not betray their **vows**,\nBut **unfurl their numinous might**,\nDriving these **malevolent demons** back to **emptiness and stillness**,\nSo that **heaven is clear and earth is tranquil**,\nAnd they **forever cease to prey upon the innocent**—\nTogether with all **living beings**, we rejoice in this **great aspiration**.\n\nThe **Officials** further reflect:\nFrom the **graves and mounds**, the **rotting bones** transform into **corpse spirits**,\nAnd from the **cliffs and vast seas**, the **stinking vapors** rise as **misty miasmas**.\nThey **spread like currents**, or **seep and permeate** through **gradual influence**.\n\nBefore the breath has fully parted, signs of rebirth already arise;\nWhen the **spirit** and **qi** grow weary, **illness** of **midlife stagnation** ensues.\n\nShould one encounter these **malevolent forces**, their **true vitality** will surely be harmed.\nSome wither like skeletal frames, others collapse as **qi** surges wildly.\nSome see their **crown of glory** droop and fall, their blood spilling beyond the **soul’s chamber**;\nOthers drain their **elixir pool**, their essence overflowing into the **cinnabar field**.\n\nThe **Officials** deeply dread that all **living beings of the world** may suffer such torments,\nAnd we earnestly hope the **Perfected Lords** will not betray their **vows**,\nBut **unfurl their numinous might**,\nDriving these **malevolent demons** back to **emptiness and stillness**,\nSo that **heaven is clear and earth is tranquil**,\nAnd they **forever cease to prey upon the innocent**—\nTogether with all **living beings**, we rejoice in this **great aspiration**.\n\nThe **Officials** further reflect:\nAcross the boundless **dusty kalpas**, they drift through the world,\nThe **wronged spirits** of the dead, their grudges festering behind.\nSome bear stolen wealth, others maimed flesh—\nTheir **karmic curses** bind tightly, their vengeance deep and relentless.\nThose who find opportunity will dwell among mortals, appearing as **living kin**;\nThose who lurk in shadows will haunt **hidden paths**, becoming **malevolent ghosts**.\nThey seize the moment to stir strife, wait for the chance to strike in secret.\nShould one encounter these **malevolent forces**, their **true vitality** will surely be harmed.\nSome suffer lingering **illness**, others face battles with ten thousand armies.\nSome groan in sickness upon bed and pillow, with no path to life;\nOthers lie stiff and lifeless upon streets and crossroads, with nowhere to appeal.\n\nThe **Officials** deeply dread that all **living beings of the world** may suffer such torments,\nAnd we earnestly hope the **Perfected Lords** will not betray their **vows**,\nBut **unfurl their numinous might**,\nDriving these **malevolent demons** back to **emptiness and stillness**,\nSo that **heaven is clear and earth is tranquil**,\nAnd all **sentient beings** may universally attain the **supreme Dao/Way**.\n\nTo honor the **Celestial Sovereign’s** vast compassion from above,\nAnd to fulfill the **Officials’** sincerity in submission below,\nWe humbly present this plea.\n\n**Twelve Vows** completed.\n**Incense burner** restored.\n\nWe respectfully summon the **Incense Officials** and **messengers of the Dao**,\nThe **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords** and all **attendant spirit officials**,\nTo command them to make my offerings appear at the **Incense burner** where I perform the **Dao/Way** at noon:\nThere, **golden elixir** and **jade-green essence** will naturally form,\n**Herbs of longevity** and **hundreds of spirits** will gather,\nAnd all **Perfected Ones** will assemble before this **Incense burner**.\n\nMay the **celestial children** and **jade maidens** of the **Ten Directions** attend,\nConveying the sincerity of my supplications through the **fragrant mists**,\nSwiftly reaching the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless Extremes**,\nBefore the **August Heavenly Jade Emperor** in the **Celestial Court**.\n\n**Exit the Hall** and recite.\n**Exit the Door**.\n\n**The Complete Daoist Rituals and Regulations, Volume Sixty-Six Complete**\n**The Complete Daoist Rituals and Regulations, Volume Sixty-Seven**\n*Disciple Zhong Li, studying the Three Caverns Scripture of the Daoist Rituals*\n**Ritual of the True Martial Spirit’s Miraculous Response to the Great Expiation**\n*Evening Dao/Way Ritual*\n\nThe ritual platform is raised as per the prescribed manner.\nEach reverently honors the Master, focusing their spirit in accordance with the Dao/Way.\n\n**Recite the Protective Spirit Incantations**:\nThe Great Yin transforms and gives birth,\nThe essence of the Water position.\nThe **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless Extremes** responds above,\nThe Tortoise and Serpent coalesce in form.\n\nCircumnavigate the Six Extremes,\nDominate the myriad spirits with awe.\nNo hidden thing escapes scrutiny,\nNo wish remains unfulfilled.\n\nAt the end of the kalpa and its beginning,\nSever and subdue the **demonic essences**.\nRescue and protect all beings,\nEnsuring peace for the family and the state.\n\nShould any **minor specters** dare to approach and manifest,\nWith one glance, the Five Sacred Mountains will crumble—\nIn harmony with the Dao/Way’s True Martial Spirit.\n\n**Beat the Law Drum twenty-four times**.\n\nThe **Supreme Three Heavens**—**Heavenly Primordial Sovereign** of the Three **Qi**,\n**Supreme Dao Lord**,\n**Supreme Old Lord**—\nSummon forth from within my body the **Three Five Officials** of my **Triple Five**,\nThe **Left and Right Officials and Messengers**,\nThe **Left and Right Bearers of Incense**,\nThe **Postal Dragon Cavalry Officers**,\nThe **Golden Boy Attendants of Incense**,\nThe **Jade Maiden Messengers of Flowers**,\nThe **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**,\nThe **Direct Day Incense Officials**,\n**Thirty-six persons in total**—to emerge.\n\nThose who exit must don **auspicious ceremonial attire**,\nWearing **headdresses and sashes with trailing ribbons**,\nOpening the **Mysterious Daoist Altar** to the **Land Spirits** and **Territorial Deities**,\nAnd the **regional spirit officials and Perfected Ones**.\n\nNow, in this quiet evening, as I practice the Dao/Way,\nI humbly present this to declare my intent—\nAll sincerity has been recorded and conveyed.\nI pray that the **Supreme Dao’s Ten-Directional Boundless Essences**,\nThe **Numinous Treasures’ Auspicious Light**,\nMay descend and flow into my body.\nMy current supplications,\nSwiftly reaching the **Supreme Dao of the Boundless Extremes**,\nBefore the **August Heavenly Jade Emperor** in the **Celestial Court**.\n\n**Request the invocation of the Dao/Way’s station**.\n\nI, **Disciple** [Name], along with the **Thirty-six Officials of the Platform**,\nHumbly present our united sincerity:\nThe **Supreme Dao of the Boundless Extremes**,\n**Primordial Sovereign of the True Martial Spirit**,\n**Supreme Dao Lord**,\n**Supreme Old Lord**,\n**Supreme Heavenly Jade Emperor**,\n**Nine Sovereigns Above**,\n**Ten-Directional Boundless Dao**,\n**Supreme Numinous Treasures Sovereign**,\nThe **Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao**,\nThe **Supreme True Martial Spirit**,\nThe **Thirty-six Departments of Sacred Scriptures and Mysterious Daoist Masters**,\nThe **True Martial Spirit of the Northern Pole**,\nThe **Responsive Deities of the Three Realms**,\nAll **Perfect Spirits**.\n\nI have heard that the **Great Ultimate** first divided,\nAnd the **Two Qi** established the hierarchy of **Emperors and Deities**.\nThe **Primordial Essence** having been apportioned,\nThe **Five Agents** promulgated the methods of transformation.\nThough the rise and fall are endless,\nThe **Root Source** remains inherently true.\nDwelling in **Kan**, it returns to the **Root and Command**,\nIn **Gèn**, it aids the **Beginning and End**.\n\nThus, **Yang** must arise from the **Yin**,\nAnd the **Emperor** first manifests in the **Zhen** position.\nDrawing from the **Heaven’s One Supreme Essence**,\nIt becomes the **foundation for all beings** under the **Auspicious Sun**.\n\nTherefore, my **True Martial Sovereign**,\nResides in the **Northern Gate**,\nEmbodying the **virtue/power of creation** from Heaven and Earth,\nWielding the **spirit of harmonizing Yin and Yang**.\nHow could this be without inherent cause?\nIt is also achieved through deliberate means.\n\nThe **Ritual Officials**, [Name] and others,\nHave reverently studied the **Daoist classics**,\nTraced the **footprints of the Perfected**,\nAnd in the **Kaihuang** era,\nOur land was named **Pure Joy**.\nThe **Yang Essence** radiates auspiciousness,\nAwakening the **extraordinary pregnancy of the Tortoise and Serpent**.\nThe **White Spirit** bears the **Perfect Roundness**,\nRevealing the **exceedingly miraculous birth of the Jade Maiden**.\nDescending into the **Purple Hall of Spirits**,\nNurturing the **virtue/power** in the **Green Palace**.\n\nOpen and unrestrained,\nThe **spirit** roams freely in **Heaven’s vast expanse**;\nPure and self-sufficient,\nViewing wealth and nobility as fleeting clouds.\n\nHaving completed the **True Martial** practice,\nMy body ascends to the **Pivot of the Sky**,\nFollowing the **Jade Emperor’s** wondrous teachings,\nAnd pacifying the **remote regions of the Northern Pole**.\n\nThe **Child and the Ox** (hours) converge,\nLeading all **Palaces** with my singular preeminence;\nThe **Supreme Dao of the Boundless Extremes** and the **True Martial Spirit** stand as twin supports,\nSurrounding and augmenting the **illustrious luminaries**.\n\nNow, as the **Ten Earthly Branches** decline in transformation,\nAnd the **Six Heavens** teem with **demonic forces**,\nThe **ominous aura** spreads unchecked,\nThe **killing qi** pervades and corrupts.\nIt has both **cut short the vitality of living beings**\nAnd **obscured and deceived the Heavenly Observation**.\nThe cries of the wronged reach the heavens,\nThe **Heavenly Sovereign’s** compassion responds with pity.\nThe **miraculous Dao/Way** is invoked and revealed,\nThe **attendant spirits** hasten to summon.\n\nThe **wind** moves, the **thunder** shakes—\nThe **courageous and mighty** are proclaimed;\nThe **lightning** sweeps, the **clouds** dissipate—\nAll **demonic and malevolent** are eradicated.\n\nThus, all beings are now rescued and protected.\nThe **Ritual Officials**, [Name] and others,\nHave long basked in your **blessings**,\nAnd humbly heard your **sacred teachings**.\nWe

**urgent sincerity**,\nDaring not to withhold this offering.\n\n**Recite the Invocation**.\n\nAs per the **formal invocation**,\nAll sincerity is fully displayed.\n\nWe humbly invoke the **Sovereign’s virtue/power**, majestic and towering,\nPressing down upon the **near attendants of the Purple Micro**;\nThe **spirit’s prowess** is swift and keen,\nProclaiming the **Jade Emperor’s** mighty **aura**.\n\nThough you bestow **commandments upon the Northern Pole**,\nYour **Heavenly Observations** extend across the **Nine Realms**.\nYour **essence** is stored in the **Water virtue/power**,\nYour **position** is anchored in the **Stellar Stream**.\n\nYour **movements** are unrestrained,\nResponding to human hearts like an echo;\nYour **clarity and wisdom** never falter,\nPunishing **demonic beings** without fail.\n\nThis is where my **vows** are fulfilled,\nAnd the **vast region** relies upon your **blessings**.\nNow, the **Ritual Officials**, [Name] and others,\nOur hearts incline like **loyal plants**,\nOur offerings are inscribed in **auspicious writings**—\nThe **incense** emits **fragrant vapors**,\nThe **lamps** align with the **stars** in radiance.\nThe **phoenix wax** releases the **spring’s splendor**,\nThe **snowflake buds** generate the **wind of rain**.\n\nAscending to the **clouds and mists**,\nWe are borne aloft by the **wind-horse**;\nIlluminating the **palaces and treasuries**,\nWe are also conveyed by the **golden coins**.\n\nReciting the **Secret Edicts** beneath the **Pure Sky**,\nInviting the **True Ones** to gather at the **humble seat**.\n\nWith this **quiet night** of **Dao practice**,\nWe, the **Law Assembly**, now light the **first incense strand**,\nWishing this **fragrant smoke** to ascend the

True One**.\n\nWe, the **subjects**, **surrender body, spirit, and fate**,\nAnd with this **meritorious act of incense-offering**,\nWe **pray for** the **current Emperor**.\n\nMay we humbly wish:\nThat the **Two Principles** remain steadfast,\nThe **Three Lights** shine in harmony,\nThat **benevolence** match **Emperor Yao and Tang**,\nAnd **transformations** surpass **Xī and Hòu**.\n\nMay the **consorts and princes**, the **heir and nobles**,\nReceive **virtue’s praise** in the **Purple Court**,\nAnd **merit** uphold the **Royal Polarity**.\n\nMay the **ministers and officials**, both **inner and outer**,\nSpread **abundant grace without favoritism**,\nAnd achieve **harmony and prosperity** to **cultivate the Way**.\n\nMay **weapons** forever be **sheathed**,\nFloods and droughts **never arise**,\nPlagues and poisons **be extinguished**,\nAnd **demonic influences** **withdraw**.\n\nNow, with this **incense-burning**,\nWe **surrender** to the **Dao’s Supreme Saints**, the **Great Saints**, the **Most True Assembly**.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao**,\nWe **ascend to the Formless**,\nAnd **harmonize** with the **True Dao**.\n\nWith this **quiet night** of **Dao practice**,\nWe, the **Law Assembly**, now light the **second incense strand**,\nWishing this **fragrant smoke** to ascend directly,\nTo **offer** to the **True Martial Lord of the Northern Dipper**, the **Responsive True One**,\nAnd his **attendant Star Lord of the Martial Chord**,\nAnd all **saints of the Northern Dipper**.\n\nWe, the **subjects**, **surrender body,

and **verify rank**,\nTo **hang blessings** and **receive auspicious fortune**,\nAnd to **see living benefits**.\n\nNow, with this **incense-burning**,\nWe **surrender** to the **Scripture’s Supreme Saints**, the **Great Saints**, the **Most True Assembly**.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao**,\nWe **ascend to the Formless**,\nAnd **harmonize** with the **True Dao**.\n\nWith this **quiet night** of

of the Mystic Middle**,\nThe **Aid-Spirit True Martial Lord of the Northern Dipper**, the **Responsive True One**,\nThe **Three Realms’ Responsive Ones**, all **true spirits**.\n\nWe have heard:\nThat the **proud, extravagant, and licentious**\nAre **close to evil**;\nThat the **upright, serene, and reverent**\nAre **beloved by the spirits**.\n\n「Though the **Most True Assembly** may be unfathomable,\nThis principle is **inevitably so**.\n\nIn reverence of the **Holy Dao**, though vast, the **upright** align with it.\nIf one seeks to dwell beneath the **Dao’s shelter and aid**,\nOne must first **purify** from accumulated **sins and errors**.\n\nWe look up to the **Great Mercy** above,\nAnd below, we manifest the **Sincere Devotion**.\n\nIn humility, we confess:\nThat beings like us, bound by the **dusty world’s entanglements**,\nEnsnared by the **worldly net**,\nAssailed by the **Six External Demons**,\nAnd deceived by the **Three Internal Emptinesses**,\nHave, in the years **Gengshen-Jiazzi** (庚申甲子),\nFailed to fulfill our **meritorious deeds**;\nIn the four seasons and three **cosmic phases** (四序三元),\nOur **incense cultivation** (熏修) has been neglected and abandoned.\n\nThe **Five Senses** (五情) have been **polluted** by the **Five Sins** (五辛),\nAnd the **Three Poisons** (三毒) have been **brewed** by the **Three Emptinesses** (三).\nWe indulge in **luxurious garments and abundant food**,\nYet never reflect on their **origins**;\nWe **slander and speak ill**,\nAnd **heed no warnings** of virtue.\n\nSome **scheme** for wealth and bribes,\nAccumulating **grudges** from **worldly petty folk**;\nOthers **slay and harm living beings**,\nSeverely **injuring** the **great virtue** of **Heaven and Earth**.\n\nWe hold **direct and unfiltered views**,\nYet our **hearts lack remorse** for past wrongs.\n\nOur **petty actions** go unacknowledged,\nWhile **true spirits** remain distant.\n\n**A hundred evils** find opportunity,\nAnd **ten thousand deaths**—how could we endure?\n\nWe dare to **petition** beneath the **Celestial Procession’s clouded palanquin** (天仗之云軿),\nAnd **pour forth** our **sincere, humble prayers** (愚衷之血恳).\n\nWe **pray for universal forgiveness** (肆赦),\nAnd **seek permission to renew ourselves**.\n\nMay we, the **incense officials** (醮官),\n**Internally purify** the **Spirit Platform** (灵台),\n**Externally align** with the **stillness of water** (止水),\nThat the **Three Palaces** (三宫) may shine with clarity,\nAnd the **Six Qi** (六气) be in harmony,\nEver maintaining the **unshaken

nourishment** (养浩之功);\nMay the **Jade Nectar** (琼液) descend and ascend,\nSo we may **ascend** and grasp the **Essence of the Valley Spirit** (谷神之要).\n\nBy **breathing** to **irrigate** the **Three Lights’ true Qi** (三光之真炁),\nWe may **prolong** our **Nine Transformations’ distant lifespan** (九转之遐年).\nMay the **Blue Scriptures** (青篇) record our **meritorious deeds**,\nAnd the **Black Registers** (黑簿) note our **transgressions and sins** (愆尤之字).\n\nWe shall **constantly depend** on the **True Law** (正法),\nAnd **borrow secretly** the **Merciful Light** (慈光).\nIn our **comings and goings**, may the **One Spirit** (明一神) **harmonize** with our **sincerity**.\nMay we **adjust** to the **cool and warm**,\nAnd **banish** all **epidemics and calamities** (疫疠).\nMay we **never encounter** **demonic creatures** (魑魅魍魉),\nAnd **inevitably attain** **wealth, longevity, health, and peace** (富寿康宁).\n\nWe **pray** that **Heaven may be clear and Earth still**,\nThat the **land flourish** and its

You give birth to Heaven and Earth, forming their shapes and essences. From the extreme convergence of **Qi** *(一气之极)*, all things flow and are harmoniously complete *(流通，万物之得咸备)*.\n\nAmong all beings, humans alone are deemed most noble and must possess a fundamental root *(根元)*; the **Dao** *(道)* originates from this very source, and thus we recognize the Primordial Ancestor *(祖始)*.\n\nSince the dawn of creation *(开辟)*, we have been ensnared in the cycle of birth and death *(缠生死之缘)*. We know the suffering of transmigration *(轮回之苦)* yet remain trapped within it; we grasp the true nature of life and death *(性命之真)* yet fail to fully embody its purity. In vain, we have studied the scriptures, worn the precepts, expounded teachings, and proclaimed doctrines, seeking the root of the Supreme Primordial *(太上希夷之根)* and exploring the origin of the mixed formation of existence *(有物混成之始)*. May those who now understand the **Dao** and their true bodies *(知道知身者)* swiftly return to their pristine and unadulterated essence *(还纯返素)*; may those who refine spirit and **Qi** *(炼神炼气者)* quickly transcend the realm of existence and enter the Void *(出有入无)*.\n\nIn the past, we once vowed to uphold the transmitted teachings, striving to broaden our understanding and enlightenment. Now, as we humbly submit and offer gratitude, our earnest intentions may be fulfilled. Our disciples’ words are sincere; we shall diligently proclaim them.\n\n**Proclamation of Words.** With meticulous care, we scrutinize our language, and our hearts’ sincerity is manifest. Our fervent resolve has been fully expressed; the purity of our intent does not wane. We reverently observe the prohibitions and precepts, meticulously follow the canonical rituals *(典彝)*, establish the altar with solemnity *(肃严)*, and gaze toward the vault of Heaven *(穹窿)* as we earnestly petition.\n\nMay our steadfast single thread of devotion *(一缕之念)* ascend to the Supreme Truth of the Ten Extremes *(十极之真)*. We realize that our primordial **Qi** *(元炁)* is obscured through countless rebirths, and our harmonious essence *(冲和)* is scattered among all things. We cling to worldly attachments *(世缘)* without cultivating the **Dao** above, ensnared by habits of love *(爱习)* and unable to return to the Mysterious Root *(玄根)*. Without true sincerity, how can we hope for universal enlightenment?\n\nLet us now abandon all past impurities in a single purification, and from this very day, we shall earnestly renew our practice. We, Your servants, shall solemnly bathe our five bodies *(五体)*, refine our six emotions *(六情)*, align ourselves with the Earth yet mirror Heaven *(法地象天)*, and carry incense with unwavering faith *(赍香奉信)*. With this day and hour, we open the altar, adhering to ritual propriety *(依仪行事)*.\n\nOn the appointed day and hour *(至某日某时)*, we shall invite the descent of the Supreme Truths *(延降上真)*, offer thanks and repentance *(谢过忏愆)*, and beseech blessings and divine commands *(祈恩请命)*. In accordance with the prescribed rites *(科法)*, we shall report this in advance *(宿以启闻)*.\n\nMay the blessings of the Supreme Primordial Three *(太上三清)*, the Ten-Directional Supreme Saints *(十方上圣)*, descend upon us with mercy and illumination. May they oversee and inspect our humble petitions, and command the Spirited Officials of the **Lingbao** *(灵宝官属)*, the True Officials of the Land *(土地真官)*, to unite in heart, combine their strength, and protect us—cleansing and purifying the altar within and without, subduing demons and malevolent spirits *(降伏妖魔)*, extinguishing all evil influences *(诚灭邪祟)*—so that our minds may be at peace and our spirits steadfast. May our sincere thoughts be immediately answered, and our petitions swiftly conveyed to the Celestial Sovereign. May our virtuous deeds be accomplished without obstruction, and our wishes fulfilled as we desire. Without hindrance, our aspirations shall be realized.\n\nThough we wear the badge of the Supreme Truth *(佩正真)*, study the Great Law *(参修大法)*, dwell within the Five Turbidities *(处身五浊)*, and bear the stains of the Six Dusts *(染迹六尘)*, our Three Passes *(三关)* remain unaligned, and our Six Emotions *(六情)* are unrestrained. We rely solely on the prohibitions and precepts to restrain our bodies and minds *(捡身心)*.\n\nThen, may the Supreme Truths descend upon us, guiding and welcoming the radiant blessings *(导迎景贶)*. At dawn, we shall perform the **Dao** *(明晨行道)*, and continue the rites as we report *(续更以闻)*. Respectfully proclaimed.\n\n**Twelve Vows.** Restoring the Furnace. We earnestly summon the Incense Officials and Messengers *(香官使者)*, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Officials *(左右龙虎君)*, and the attendant Spirited Officials of the Incense *(侍香诸灵官)*. May they command that at the place where we formerly solemnly invoked and walked the **Dao** *(臣向来肃启行道之所)*, there shall naturally arise the Golden Elixir and Azure Jade *(金液丹碧)*, the Hundred Spirited Herbs and Blossoms *(芝英百灵)*, and the gathering of all True Ones *(众真交会)*, right here before this Incense Furnace.\n\nMay it be our vow that the Celestial Youth and Jade Maidens of the Ten Directions *(十方仙童玉女)* attend and receive the incense smoke, swiftly transmitting our sincere invocation *(所启之诚)* to the Supreme Primordial, the Boundless Great **Dao** *(至真无极大道)*, and the Celestial Jade Emperor’s august presence *(昊天玉皇上帝御前)*.\n\n**Eulogy Upon Exiting the Hall.** Exiting the Hall, we chant.

**Numinous Treasure Auspicious Light** descend,\nflowing into my body,\nso that my invocation may swiftly reach the **Most High’s Boundless Great Dao** and the **Celestial Jade Emperor’s august

Stillness**\nwas grandly expounded in the **Western Zhou**.\n\n**The Wind of the Zhengyi Dao** spread in the **Eastern Han**.\nFrom the **Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s** creation of the cosmos,\nthe **Dao** was held as supreme;\nWhen **Pangu** opened the heavens,\nthe **divine transformations** took precedence.\n\nTo the east, the **Flying Phoenix** arrayed its splendor,\nto the west, the **Spiritual Peaks** stood in ranks;\nto the south, the **Crimson Ridge** ascended,\nto the north, the **Primordial Gate** loomed.\n\nThus arose the **Supreme Sage** who wields the **Symbol of Authority**,\nthe **Highest True Ones** who rule the **Celestial Pole**,\nseated in dominion over the **Nine Purity**,\noverseeing the **Three Realms**,\nguiding the **Two Qi** in harmony,\nconvening the **Ten Thousand Spirits**,\nbroadly dispersing the **gentle winds of mercy**,\ngraciously descending upon the **lower earth**.\n\nNow, in this age of the **Heavenly Treasure’s** auspicious cycle,\nthe **Dragon Han**’s **transformative source** is uniquely manifest,\nuniversally benefiting all humankind,\nthat they may attain the **Domain of Longevity**.\n\nThe **Zhengyi Daoist** of

lineage**,\nbearing the **sacred texts** in reverence.\nYet through **accumulated karmic weight**,\nI was ensnared in **erroneous realms**.\n\nAt the **Three Assemblies** and **Five Grand Rituals**,\nI fell short in fulfilling the **morning tribute’s** duty;\nDuring the **Eight Festivals** and **Three Celestial Cycles**,\nI neglected the **rituals of advancement and cultivation**.\n\nThe **Six Yang** and **Ten Rectitudes**,\nI honored yet still transgressed;\nIn the **Jiazi** and **Gengshen** years,\nI performed **sparse and incomplete rituals**.\n\nThe **Nine Grades of Abstinence**,\nI did not fully comprehend the **True Doctrine**;\nThe **Three Thousand Meritorious Deeds**,\nI lacked reliance upon the **Sacred Teachings**.\n\nThe **precepts** are most grave,\nand my observances often failed;\nThe **disciplinary laws** are stern,\nyet my practice left gaps.\n\nMy **mind was not pure**, my **intentions disordered**,\nviolating the **One Hundred and Eight Precepts**;\nMy **wisdom was shallow**, my **understanding dim**,\ntransgressing the **Three Hundred Great Vows**.\n\nThe **Six Passions** and **Ten Evils**,\nmy offenses piled like

[《散花》].\n**Requesting the invocation of the Daoist ranks again** [《再称法位》].\nI, **a humble servant of such-and-such rank** [《具位臣某》], together with the **assembled Daoist officials** [《与合坛官众等》],\n**Solemnly and sincerely present our prayers once more** [《谨重诚上启》],\nTo the **Heavenly Sovereign of Natural and Spontaneous Primordial Beginning** [《虚无自然元始天尊》],\nThe **Most High Dao Lord** [《太上大道君》],\nThe **Most High Old Lord** [《太上老君》],\nThe **Heavenly Sovereign of Jade Clarity** [《昊天玉皇上帝》],\nThe **Great Emperor of the Celestial Mansion** [《勾陈天皇大帝》],\nThe **Great Emperor of the Northern Pole** [《北极紫微大帝》],\nThe **Earthly Deity who Follows Heaven and Practices the Dao** [《承天效法后土皇地祇》],\nThe **Heavenly Sovereigns and Sovereigns of All Heavens** [《诸天天尊，诸天上帝》],\nThe **Two Ranks of the Ritual Feast**, **all belonging to the High Daoists** [《醮筵两班，合属高真》].\n\n**With reverence, I await the Great Compassion** [《伏望洪慈》],\n**And pray for the profound understanding** [《洞回照鉴》].\nI hear that the **Sun, Moon, Stars, and Planets** dwell **above the Azure Sky and Jade Void** [《臣闻日月星辰，在碧汉瑶空之上》];\nThe **Immortal Spirits and Sovereign Masters** reside **within the Pure and Serene Forest’s slopes** [《仙灵主宰，居清虚林麓之间》].\nSome **oversee the Sacred Daoist Platform**, some **hide in auspicious lands** [《或管摄於灵坛，或隐居於福地》],\nSome **govern the head of a Direction**, some **are honored as the Five Earthly Deities** [《或镇一方之首，或为五土之尊》],\n**Recording the two books of good and evil**, **holding the two ledgers of merits and transgressions** [《录善恶之二书，举功过之两簿》],\nThus **they have no private favoritism**, **only the Dao is followed** [《故无私蹈，惟道是从》].\n\n**In reflection**, I and my **assembled Daoist officials** have **long embraced the True Dao’s winds**, **early relied on the Dao’s transformation** [《伏念臣等早簉真风，夙依道化》],\n**Received the blessings of the Daoist Gate**, **taken refuge in the Hall of Sacred Treasures** [《受法门之庥荫，寄琳馆以安居》],\nYet **I am ashamed to have lost the cause of the Ten Virtues** [《惭亡十善之因》],\n**How can I repay the Three Pure Ones’ benevolence** [《何赞三清之惠》]?\nSince **I first donned the Daoist robes**, **many cycles of time have passed** [《自从披戴，几度光阴》],\nYet **I have not been able to deeply move the Divine Beings** [《未能感彻於神明》],\n**And often have lightly violated the Precepts** [《动有轻违於科戒》].\n**Initially diligent yet finally negligent**, **with a beginning but no end** [《初勤末怠，有始无终》],\n**My devotion to the Dao is flawed**, **my compassion and virtue are not upright** [《奉法心邪，慈仁不正》],\n**I burn incense without proper ritual**, **my prayers violate the Dao’s words** [《焚香失节，存念违言》].\nI fear that **my three transgressions** [《虑三彭》] may be **secretly recorded in the ledgers of guilt** [《暗奏於愆辜》],\nAnd that **my nine offenses** [《惧九府》] might be **clearly inscribed in the registers of sin** [《明书於罪目》].\n\nNow, **I humbly present my sincere and earnest prayers** [《今则辄倾丹悃》],\n**Extensively arranging incense and lamps** [《广列香灯》],\nInvoking the **Divine Beings of the Heavenly and Void Realms** [《请天界空界之群真》],\nAnd summoning the **Holy Assembly of the Underworld and Water Realm** [《延地府水府之众圣》],\nThe **Five Sacred Mountains’ Sovereign Masters** [《五岳主宰》],\nThe **Ten Sacred Caves’ Spirit Officials** [《十洞灵官》],\nI pray that **they may accept the humble offerings** [《愿歆苹藻之羞\n\nThe Five Winds and Ten Rains bestow upon me the longevity of Tang and Yu;\nThe seas grow tranquil, the rivers clear, harmonizing with the transformations of Xī and Xuān.\n\nWe, Your humble servants, have been graced by the Master’s teachings,\nAnd entrusted with our duties—\nFor all who seek refuge, it is proper to report them.\nHow much more so when we receive Your sacred words—\nHow dare we fail to present them above?\n\n**The Edict is proclaimed.**\nThe Edict is fully proclaimed; our sincerity is earnest and sincere.\n\nWe lay bare our hearts and lungs,\nPour forth our deepest intentions,\nHoping to express the loyalty of Your servants and children,\nAnd to repay the humility of our station.\n\nWe humbly pray to the **Celestial Sovereign of the Void and Natural**,\nTo the **Highest Dao Lord**,\nTo the **Supreme Old Lord**,\nTo the **Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty**,\nTo the **Great Emperor of the Gourd Cluster**,\nTo the **Great Emperor of the Northern Pole’s Purple Micro**,\nTo the **Earthly Sovereign of the Posterior Soil**,\nTo all the **Heavenly Lords**,\nTo all the **Heavenly Emperors**,\nTo the **Highest Worthies of the Round Canopy** above,\nTo the **Sovereign Masters of the Four Quarters** below—\nTo all the **Spiritual and Holy Ones**, past and present,\nTo the **Teachers and Ancestors of the Ritual Assembly**—\nThat Your boundless compassion may pierce the depths and return with wisdom.\n\nWe have heard that the **Void and Natural** is the **Mystic Sovereignty of the Three Pure Ones**,\nAnd that the **Southern Pole’s Record-Keeper** truly holds the **Total Authority of the Nine Departments**.\nThey oversee the **Records of Fortune and Misfortune**,\nJudge the **Length of Life and Death**—\nWhere merit is added, guilt is erased;\nWhere virtue is recorded, vice is removed.\nThus, there is no door of partiality,\nNor room for frivolous petition.\n\nWe, Your humble servants, are of frail **Lower Elemental** constitution,\nOur bodies burdened by the **Three Delusions**.\nThough we have received the Master’s guidance,\nAnd been pointed toward the path of ascent—\nAlas! The **Sacred Scriptures and Precious Laws** are transmitted but once in seven hundred years;\nThe **Phoenix Seals and Tortoise Diagrams** appear but once in six cycles of the Heavenly Stems.\nThey are not given to mortals,\nNor transmitted without the Dao.\n\nIn the boundless **Pure Void**, in the distant **Purple Bureaucracy**,\nThe path to **Long Life** is obtained—\nYet none shall meet **Early Death**.\n\nWe rely on the **Great Vehicle of Single Aspiration**,\nAbandoning the **Three Delusions**,\nFreeing ourselves from the **Net of Attachment**,\nAnd severing the **Causes of Affliction**.\n\nThus, the Dao naturally aligns with the **Three Existences**,\nAnd the person attains **Oneness**.\nBy preserving the **Spirit-Body**, one nurtures longevity;\nBy banishing the **Ghostly Corpse**, one secures full years.\n\nYet the **Mysterious Symbols** remain elusive,\nAnd **Conditional Beings** have not yet been abandoned—\nStill dwelling in the **Abode of Immortals**,\nYet lingering in the **Filth of the Dust**.\n\nThe Dao is scarce in its **Adaptability**,\nAnd our practices are **Negligent in Concealment and Manifestation**.\nOur nature is **Obscured by Ultimate Truth**,\nOur conduct **Falls short of Profound Subtlety**.\n\nThus, the **Three Calamities** return to assail,\nAnd the **Four Great Elements** are invaded.\nWe follow the **Heavenly Master’s Ritual of Atonement**,\nAnd establish the **Soul-Jewel Altar of True Declaration**.\n\nWe kneel and supplicate at the **Mysterious Gate**,\nAnd pour forth our **Sincere Prayers**.\n\nWe humbly pray that the **Jade Ledgers of the Three Officials** may pardon our **Violations of Scripture and Precepts**,\nAnd that the **Jade Tablets of the Five Emperors** may absolve our **Past Mistakes and Unintentional Offenses**.\n\nThen, the **Law-Waters of the Merit-Mountain** shall wash away our **Dusty Filth**,\nAnd the **True Winds of the Wisdom-Forest** shall revive our **Decayed Wood**.\n\nThe **Breakers of Grievances** shall preserve our **Steadfast Vows**,\nAnd the **Protectors of the Law** shall uphold the **Practitioners of the Path**.\n\nThe **Ten Sage Disciples** and the **Four Categories of Adepts** shall perceive the **Mysteries of the Three Teachings**,\nAnd behold the **Doors and Windows of the Multitude of Worthies**.\n\nWe hope that the **True Court** may flourish and be revered by the **Four Seas**,\nAnd that we may be graced by the **Personal Guidance of the Most Sacred**,\nTransmitting the **Mystic Instructions of Non-Action**.\n\nYet we reflect that our time in the **Law-Gate** is brief,\nAnd our seeking of the Teacher has been shallow.\nWe do not grasp the **Essence of the Teaching**,\nNor fully recognize the **Principles of Ritual Decorum**.\n\nThus, though we act to benefit others,\nOur merit yields no immediate response;\nThough we follow the Teachings in practice,\nOur devotion rarely brings manifestation.\n\nWe fear the **Four Departments of Punishment**,\nAnd the **Heavenly Rebuke for False Speech**—\nNow, as we humbly prostrate and confess,\nWe pray for Your mercy and forgiveness.\n\nWe further hope that our petitions may be answered,\nThat the **Teachings may spread throughout the Ten Directions**,\nAnd that the **Ritual Offerings to the Worthies** may be proclaimed far and wide.\n\nMay all **Humans and Celestials** hold us in reverence,\nMay the **Altar’s Faith** remain pure and fragrant—\nAll shall be nourished by Your **Bountiful Grace**,\nAnd attain the **Favor of the Phoenix and the Great Bird**.\n\nWe, Your humble servants, are overwhelmed by our **Repeated Prostrations and Earnest Petitions**.\n\n**The Wine Offering is presented and the final libation poured.**\n**Flowers are scattered.**\n**The Ritual Positions are reaffirmed.**\n\nWe, **Your humble servant of such-and-such rank**, together with the **Assembled Officials of the Altar**,\nSolemnly and sincerely petition above—\nTo the **Nine Pure Ones and Ten Extremes**,\nTo the **Ten Thousand Saints and Thousand Worthies**,\nTo the **Descending Spirits of the Ritual Assembly**,\nTo all the **Holy Beings**—\n\nWe have heard that the **Sacred Worthies are distant and exalted**,\nTheir **Mysteries hidden within the Mysterious**,\nTheir **Dao-Realm lofty and void**,\nResiding in the **Symbol beyond Symbols**.\n\nWe rely on the **Fragrance of Incense** to reach their presence,\nAnd with utmost sincerity, hope to touch their **Divine Response**.\nThe **Original Creator is without bias**,\nAnd their **Piercing Insight** is all-encompassing.\n\nWe arrange the incense sticks in abundance,\nAnd kneel before the **True Immortals**,\nReflecting on our **Conduct and Concealments**—\nOur countless lifetimes of encounters,\nOur adherence to the **Transformations of Your Majesty**,\nOur propagation of the **Winds of the Great Dao**,\nOur blessings bestowed upon **Humans and Celestials**,\nOur **Universal Beneficence in Life and Death**—\nSince we first donned the **Feathers of Immortality**,\nAnd stepped upon the **Star Altar**,\nWe have surpassed **Ten Years of Honor**,\nAnd early been graced by the **Fortune of a Hundred Lifetimes**.\n\nThe **Fragrance of Incense** is offered with reverence and sincerity,\nTo pay homage to the **Nine Celestial Worthies** and **Ten Extremes**,\nTo the **Ten Thousand Saints** and **Thousand True Ones**,\nAnd to beseech the **Divine Response** at the ritual feast.\n\nWe **humble ourselves**, lamenting that the **Three Passes** remain unsettled,\nAnd that the **Single Nature** still lies in darkness.\nBefore our eyes, the **Five Desires** and **Six Emotions**—\nHow can we even briefly abandon them?\nWithin our bodies, the **Three Calamities** and **Nine Afflictions**—\nHow can we not feel shame at their approach?\n\nAgain, we fear that our learning is dimmed by **Divine Clarity**,\nOur **Essential Teachings** obscured by dulled perception.\nHow can we recognize the **Principle of Forgetting the Trap**?\nHow can we enter the **Gate of Liberation from Illusion**?\nMorning and evening, we ponder deeply—\nTo whom shall we first reveal our sincerity?\n\nThus, we devoutly adhere to the **ritual precepts and laws**,\nAnd humbly present our **heartfelt petitions**,\nTo atone for past **transgressions and offenses**,\nAnd to resolve future **calamities and encounters**.\n\nWe earnestly pray that **Great Benevolence** be widely bestowed,\nAnd that **Divine Rain and Dew** shower their profound grace;\nThat **Abundant Blessings** extend far and wide,\nAnd that **Mountain and River’s Favor** be generously bestowed.\n\nMay **Azure Dragon** and **White Tiger** ever provide **sheltering protection**,\nAnd may **Luminous Crane** and **Mysterious Tortoise** grant **longevity and auspicious blessings**.\n\nAgain, we fear that gazing upon the stars and saints to touch the **Extraordinary Dao**,\nWearing strange garments and speaking of the **Way**,\n**Exaggerates the Six Bandits** and **increases the Five Tastes**,\nDisrespecting **Master and Sage**,\nLightly defying **Heaven and Earth**,\nAnd **recklessly climbing**—\nAll of which harm the **sentient beings**.\n\nWe pray that through the **power of incense and flame**,\nWe may all attain the **path of dispelling calamities**,\nAnd that the **Spiritual Passes** may be brightly illuminated,\nOur **Enlightened Nature** made clear,\nTo obtain the **Scriptures of Eternal Life and Longevity**,\nAnd to master the **Alchemy of the Golden Elixir**.\n\nThe **Precepts of our Ancestral Master** are followed,\nAnd the **Teachings of our Lineage** are upheld.\nAll depart from the **Land of Darkness**,\nAnd enter the **Realm of Clarity**.\n\n**Flying, swimming, crawling, and moving creatures**,\nAll **sentient beings** with awareness,\nRely upon the **Dao’s Benevolence**,\nAnd ascend together to the **Domain of Longevity**.\n\nWe, your humble disciples, gaze upon the **Law** with fixed attention,\nAnd meditate upon the **Great Void**.\nDeeply regretting the **dust of worldly affairs**,\nWe struggle to retain the **Divine Footsteps**.\n\nOur **lower emotions** cannot bear the **longing for attachment**—\nThus, we bow in reverence and offer our **sincere devotion**.\n\n**Offering the Sage**, **transforming wealth**.\n**Forward and return**, **dedicating merit**.\nThe **Complete Collection of Daoist Ritual Precepts**, Volume Seventy-Three concludes.\nThe **Complete Collection of Daoist Ritual Precepts**, Volume Seventy-Four begins.\n\n**Daoist Ritual of Repentance for Cultivators of the True Way**\n**Repentance for Ignorance of the Dao**\n\n**Eastward Repentance for the Sin of Not Knowing the Dao**\n\nWe, the humble Daoists bearing talismans, humbly hear that wood arises from the Three [Heavenly Stems], taking form beneath Heaven and Earth; the Sovereign emerges from *Zhen* [Thunder], nurturing all things in *Tun-Meng* [Difficulty and Obscurity]. The Azure Dragon governs the first key of the year, the Big Dipper marks the beginning of celestial passage, and the Minor Yang presides with boundless virtue beyond naming.\n\nNow, we, the Daoists of such-and-such lineage, have long practiced purity in cultivation. In this lifetime, blessed by the Teacher’s grace, we have received transmission and uphold the teachings with reverence. Yet, we remain ashamed of our shallow roots and obstructed spiritual source.\n\nThough we walk the Dao, we do not know it truly;\nThough we nurture the form, we cannot forget it.\nWe move, yet cling to appearances.\nSome boast in idle speech, self-satisfied;\nOthers hear the Dao yet grasp it faintly—now present, now absent.\nBetween wealth and poverty, we fail to equalize all things;\nAt the touch of joy, anger, likes, and dislikes, we burn with discord.\n\nHow then do we mingle with Heaven and humanity in the same path,\nRealize the unity of birth and death,\nBetray the Great Sage’s nurturing virtue,\nDefy the Mysterious Teacher’s transformative precepts?\nThus, we are recorded in the Three Officials’ ledgers,\nAnd our names are struck from the Five Emperors’ registers.\n\nWith deepest reverence, we now repent.\nWe humbly offer incense, flowers, and the rites of faith,\nWith sincere hearts turning to the East:\nThe **Supreme Soul of the Limitless, the Most High Treasure of Heaven**,\nThe **Nine-Qi Heavenly Sovereign**,\nThe **Eastern Court Immortals**,\nAnd all **Spiritual Officials**.\n\nWe pray to the Most High Virtue, who cherishes life,\nThe Boundless Mercy that benefits all beings,\nThe Green Scriptures that pardon transgressions,\nThe Eastern Heavens that decree immortality—\nOpening the heart to the Natural Void,\nGranting the Dao of the Supreme One’s Embracing Truth.\n\nNeither delayed nor hastened, it endures eternally;\nWithout gates or barriers, it permeates the Four Reaches.\nTransforming the world, turning hearts toward the Dao,\nEqualizing all under the Sage’s compassionate gaze.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend to the Formless,\nAnd harmonize with the True.\n\n---\n**Southward Repentance for the Sin of Not Repaying the Nation’s Grace**\n\nWe humbly hear that from the Void arises *Li* [Fire],\nAnd all things emerge to grow and be nourished.\nOn the second day, Fire follows,\nThe Great Person continues the radiance, illuminating all.\n\nFrom the Wood we receive transformation and nurture for all living beings,\nBy the Water we are shaped and refined in character and destiny.\nThe virtuous Sage draws upon these—\nGreat deeds accomplished through their embrace.\n\nNow, we humble Daoists with talismans at our sides,\nBorn in the Central Land, steeped in the Sage’s radiance,\nBow to the Sovereign’s benevolent rule,\nHearing the people’s devotion and return.\n\nThus, we may bear the breath of purity,\nAnd aid the Sage’s bright and virtuous way.\n\nYet, lingering in idle life, content with fleeting ease,\nWe lack the embrace of the Dao or cultivation of virtue to transform others,\nFailing to restore the ancient simplicity or return to the uncarved,\nAdorning worldly rites and seeking fame in mortal affairs,\nEmptyly claiming the nation’s grace,\nAnd presumptuously standing among the Daoist ranks.\n\nOur names are not inscribed in the Southern Celestial Register,\nAnd the Yin Mountains record our countless transgressions.\n\nOnly the Sage sits facing south to govern,\nOnly the nation’s great virtue commands Heaven’s mandate.\nHaving invoked the decree from the boundless sky,\nWe dare now submit our hearts to the stars’ appointed regions.\n\nWith utmost reverence, we offer incense, flowers, scriptures, and devotional rites,\nAnd bow our sincerest vows to the **Southern** Boundless **Supreme** **Jewel** **Heavenly** **Venerable** **Lord**,\nThe **Three Breaths** Heavenly Sovereign,\nThe **Southern** **Mansion** **Divine** **Immortal**,\nAnd all the **Spiritual Officials**.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that **virtue** thrives in Fire,\nThe Sage turns toward radiance,\nGranting longevity and reverence to all people,\nRooting blessings across generations.\n\nNext, we pray that we Daoists with talismans at our sides,\nMay find pardon in the **Six Ministries**,\nAnd receive the **Three Breaths’** luminous grace.\n\nIn our **inner alchemy**, may we **cultivate** the **Heart** with **emptiness**,\nAnd **nourish** the **Spirit** so that it remains ever tranquil.\nIn the **outer alchemy** of summer, may we **harness** the **Yin**,\nAnd **restrain** the Fire within so that it does not scatter.\n\nThus, we may **embrace** the **One** and **guard** the **Middle**,\nAnd **hope** to attain **longevity** and **transcend** the world.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend to the **Formless**,\nAnd harmonize with the **True**.\n\n---\n**Westward Repentance for the Sin of Not Repaying Ancestors’ and Parents’ Grace**\n\nWe humble ones hear that the **严凝** [austerity and solemnity] is **义** [righteous],\nAll things depend upon it to achieve their **西成** [westward fulfillment].\n\nThe **正** [upright] and **和** [harmonious] prevail,\nThe people return to the **兑说** [Joyful Teachings of the West].\n\nFirst, it enforces **杀** [rigor and restraint] to aid the **Great Transformation**,\nLater, it **静退** [withdraws in stillness] to manifest the **少阴** [Lesser Yin].\n\nIn accordance with Heaven and the people,\nFirm within, yielding without.\n\nNow, we humble Daoists with talismans at our sides,\nThough lacking innate wisdom, we recognize the **大本** [Great Principles] of filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trust,\nAnd through transmission, we point to the **真乘** [True Vehicle] of the Natural Void and purity.\n\nOur **virtue** rivals that of Heaven and Earth,\nOur **grace** surpasses that of parents.\n\nYet, we fail to uphold the **禁戒** [precepts],\nAnd neglect the **禀修** [cultivation] of the Dao.\nThe **Eight Festivals** do not advance our **表章** [manifestation of virtue],\nAnd the **Five Sacrifices** are not performed with **严** [rigor].\n\nThough our **才分** [talents and fates] and **形器** [bodies and destinies] are bestowed by our parents’ life-giving grace,\nEven across the ages, we have **亏** [failed] in our **子职** [duties as offspring].\n\nYet, parents’ love is tender and without reproach,\nAnd Heaven and Earth are just yet without favor.\n\nOur own sins cannot be escaped,\nAnd **不孝** [filial disobedience] has no pardon.\nDaring to forget repentance and atonement,\nWe now humbly confess our faults,\nSending our sincerity to the **七宝金门** [Golden Gate of the Seven Treasures],\nAnd focusing our thoughts on the **西那玉国** [Jade Realm of the Western Retribution].\n\nWe seek the **境** [domain] of the **上智** [Superior Sage] to repay our **恩** [grace],\nAnd rely upon the **元尊** [Primordial Venerable One]’s **说法** [teaching hall].\n\nWith utmost reverence, we offer incense, flowers, scriptures, and devotional rites,\nAnd bow our sincerest vows to the **Western** Boundless **Supreme** **Jewel** **Heavenly** **Venerable** **Lord**,\nThe **Seven Breaths** Heavenly Sovereign,\nThe **Western** **Mansion** **Divine** **Immortal**,\nAnd all the **Spiritual Officials**.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge the **金光** [Golden Light] that illuminates below,\nThe **玉简** [Jade Tablets] that clearly return our deeds.\nOur ancestors all receive blessings of **升迁** [promotion and ascent],\nOur parents each gain **殊胜** [exceptional merit].\n\nNext, we pray that we Daoists with talismans at our sides,\nMay receive the **Western** **Tortoise’s** transmission of the Dao,\nAnd visit the **仙母** [Immortal Mother] to refine our **甲庚** [first and sixth heavenly stems].\n\nMay the **金虎** [Golden Tiger] dwell in **离** [the Fire position],\nAnd we **交** [interact] with the **真龙** [Authentic Dragon] to enter **戊己** [the Earth position].\n\nWithout **暴** [excessively] depleting our **气** [vitality],\nMay our **真元** [True Essence] be **守** [preserved],\nAnd without **劳** [overworking] our **神** [Spirit],\nMay our **寿命** [lifespan] be **无期** [boundless].\n\nFree from **魔试** [demonic temptations],\nOur **心源** [source of the heart] may be **自定** [self-stabilized].\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend to the **Formless**,\nAnd harmonize with the **True**.\n\n---\n**Northward Repentance for the Sin of Not Repaying the Master’s Grace**\n\nWe humble ones hear that before the **太极** [Supreme Polarity] was divided,\nIt contained the **三才** [Three Powers: Heaven, Earth, Man] in **混沌** [primordial chaos].\n\nWhen the **五行** [Five Phases] were distinguished,\nThey followed the **一炁** [Single Breath] in their **循环** [cyclical course].\n\nThe **阳** [Yang] lies dormant within,\nAnd all things are **藏** [concealed].\nThe **辰** [stellar positions] reside in their places,\nAnd the **众星** [multitudes of stars] bow in reverence,\nThe **枢机** [pivotal mechanisms] of transformation,\nThe **主宰** [lords] who govern all living beings.\n\nNow, we humble Daoists with talismans at our sides,\nThough lacking innate wisdom, we follow the Master’s guidance.\nFrom the **训提** [early instruction],\nWe know the **大本** [Great Principles] of filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trust,\nAnd through **传度** [transmission],\nWe are directed toward the **真乘** [True Vehicle] of the Natural Void and purity.\n\nOur **德** [virtue] ascends to the heights of Heaven and Earth,\nOur **恩** [grace] surpasses that of parents.\n\nYet, we fail to **尊承** [properly honor] the **素昧** [unseen and profound],\nAnd our **给养** [nourishment] is insufficient.\nWe **负** [betray] the **抠衣授道** [Master’s humble teaching],\nAnd **违** [violate] the **歃血引盟** [oath of blood and covenant].\n\nWe **泄** [leak] the **机微** [subtle secrets] to the **尘世** [mundane world],\nAnd **传** [reveal] the **道** [Dao] to those **非人** [unworthy].\n\nEven when **遇祸** [facing calamity] and **招殃** [inviting retribution],\nWe still **怨师** [blame the Master] and **咎道** [accuse the Dao],\nFearing our **罪书** [record of sins] in the **九府** [Nine Palaces],\nAnd dreading our **身谢** [life’s termination] at the hands of the **三官** [Three Officials].\n\nWe believe that to **迎师** [invite the Master] is to face north in **尊崇** [reverence],\nThus, we confess our faults and plead with the **坎宫** [Kan Palace of the North].\n\nWith utmost reverence, we offer incense, flowers, scriptures, and devotional rites,\nAnd bow our sincerest vows to the **Northern** Boundless **Supreme** **Jewel** **Heavenly** **Venerable** **Lord**,\nThe **Five Breaths** Heavenly Sovereign,\nThe **Northern** **Mansion** **Divine** **Immortal**,\nAnd all the **Spiritual Officials**.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that the **北辰** [Northern Dipper] holds the **仙名** [names of the Immortals],\nAnd the **壁宿** [Wall Constellations] oversee the **道术** [arts of the Dao].\n\nThe **宗师** [Master] transmits the Dao,\nAnd **永隆** [eternally upholds] the **弘教** [great teaching].\nThrough **保举** [recommendation] and **监盟** [oversight of covenants],\nThey **益务** [further strive] to **成人之美** [fulfill the potential of others].\n\nWithout a **师** [Master], there is no **度** [transmission],\nAnd even the **有翼** [winged] must **飞** [soar].\nAll together we aspire to the **功行** [meritorious deeds],\nAnd share in the **升仙** [ascension to immortality] **果** [realization].\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend to the **Formless**,\nAnd harmonize with the **True**.\n\n---\n**Northeastward Repentance for the Sin of Imperfect Teaching and Transmission**\n\nWe humble ones hear that the **神功** [Divine Function] does not **宰** [rule],\nIt serves as the **始终** [beginning and end] of Heaven and Earth.\nThe **妙本** [Wondrous Source] is **自然** [self-so],\nIt governs the **动止** [movement and rest] of **阴阳** [Yin and Yang].\n\nWe stretch forth the **Hand of Transformation** [伸其转物之手],\nAnd bestow the **Dragon of Emergence** [授以出震之龙],\nIts **changes and constancies** [变化有常] are **unforced** [推移不武].\n\nNow, we sincerely present **Daoists bearing talismans and scriptures** [有佩箓道士某等],\nAs **descendants of the Most High** [太上之子],\nAnd **proponents of the Daoist tradition** [道家者流],\nYet we have not **hidden in secluded valleys to preserve the spirit** [隐谷以存神],\nNor **abided in quietude to expound the teachings** [约以居寂而演教].\nInstead, our **sincere hearts grow scattered** [诚心易散],\nAnd **wondrous methods prove difficult to refine** [妙法难精].\nOur **doctrines lack coherence** [宣科而条理乖张],\nAnd our **conduct falters in dignity** [临事而威仪跛倚],\nWhile the **Six Demons** [六魔] mock our **erroneous practices** [想法乱],\nAnd the **Ten Thousand Spirits** [万神] refuse to dwell where our **meditation is deficient** [存思缺].\n\nOur **endeavors are feeble** [力么微],\nAnd we **lean neither on the profound nor the manifest** [幽明无所依赖];\nOur **nature and emotions are disordered** [性情挠乱],\nMaking **communication with Heaven and humanity arduous** [天人难以感通].\nUnable to **bridge the sacred and the mundane** [契圣以契凡],\nHow can we **fulfill the Dao’s purpose for all beings** [孰为成物而成务]?\n\nWe fear the **records of the Dark Classics** [黑书] may **note our faults** [纪过],\nAnd dread that the **registers of immortals** [仙籍] may **sever our merit** [断功].\nIn **humility and negligence**, we confess our failings [苟慢自陈],\nLest we **incur celestial censure** [贻阴谴].\n\nWith **devoted offerings of incense, flowers, and sincere vows** [香花拷信供养之仪],\nWe **wholeheartedly submit** [至心归命] to the **Most High Sovereign of the Primordial Dao** [东北方无极太上灵宝天尊],\nThe **Celestial Lord of the Five Essences** [梵炁天君],\nThe **Divine Immortals of the East-North** [东北方神仙],\nAnd the **Assemblage of Spirits** [诸灵官].\n\nWe **solemnly beseech** [仰惟] the **Four Celestial Overseers** [申敕四司],\nAnd **hear the commandments of the Nine Celestial Departments** [告闻九府],\nThat our **meritorious deeds may accumulate** [复功行於铢积寸累],\nAnd our **transgressions be pardoned** [赦过尤]—\n**Like clouds dispersed by mist** [雾卷云披].\n\nMay **celestial intent be conveyed through speech** [驿意传言],\nAnd **resonance ascend to the Divine** [感应声而上彻];\nMay our **petitions reach the heights** [升章谒款],\nSo that our **wishes may align** [俾随愿以克谐].\n\nThen, we **elevate our aspirations to the heavens** [抗志云阿],\nAnd **dwell in mountain caverns** [栖身山洞],\nAchieving **effortless transcendence above the age** [得逍遥於一世之上],\nAnd **resting the Wheel of Rebirth within the Three Realms** [息轮转於三界之中].\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend to the **Formless**,\nAnd harmonize with the **True**.\n\n**East-Southward Repentance for the Sin of Neglecting the Sacred Scriptures, Precepts, and Talismans**\n\nWe humble ones hear that the **Primordial Transformation** [元化] **shapes existence** [裁形],\nAnd there must be **those who uphold its authority** [必有主张之者];\nThe **Numinous Wind** [灵风] **nurtures all things** [煦物],\nAnd the **Celestial Bureaus** [皇司] hold **commanding sway** [命令之权].\n\n**East-Southward Repentance for Neglecting Sacred Scriptures, Precepts, and Talismans**\n\nHarmonizing with the **Receptive** [Xún] and resounding with **flourishing brilliance** [振美盛明],\nAssisted by the **Sieve** [Jī] to gather and disperse, **nurturing and inspiring** [歙扬鼓舞],\nThe **Great Virtue** remains hidden, unknown to the common folk.\n\nNow, we, the **Daoist adepts bearing talismans** [佩箓道士], of humble birth and mortal form [挺质凡胎],\nShelter beneath the **Dao’s shelter** [栖身道荫],\nWander through the **ornate halls of the Dao** [优游琳宇],\nYet sometimes fail in **diligence in burning and refining** [或不谨於焚修];\nLeft and right, the **sacred texts** [洞章] are not held with **due reverence** [或不严於敬重].\nWe bear talismans yet **transgress ranks and order** [佩箓而踰阶越次],\nHold fasts yet **disrupt days and times** [持斋而废日乱时].\nOfficials, soldiers, and clerks—**three assemblies** [三会]—speak not of merit and reward;\n**Gowned and armed**, we dwell yet **often mingle with the profane** [常居而多见混淆].\nOur **Daoic power is weak and shallow** [道力寡浅],\nWhile **ghosts and demons assail us** [而尸鬼交攻];\nOur **precepts are slight and feeble** [戒行细微],\nAnd the **numinous protection fails** [而威神不护].\nWe **master the scriptures yet distort their essence** [通经而驳杂本旨], clinging to petty wisdom;\nWe **teach the Dao yet cloak ourselves in empty words** [行教而□袭浮辞], failing to embody the **Great Purity** [大淳未至].\nThus, we **serve Heaven yet see no response** [奉天而事无响应],\nAnd **violate the laws, bearing guilt from birth** [违科而罪与生俱].\n\nWe now **offer the rites of repentance** [用陈忏谢之仪],\nHoping for **forgiveness and grace** [以冀赦原之泽].\nWith **incense, flowers, and offerings of faith** [谨赍香花法信供养之仪],\nWe **devoutly submit** to the **East-Southward Supreme Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure** [无极太上灵宝天尊],\nThe **Celestial Qi Sovereign** [梵炁天君],\nThe **East-Southward Immortal Deities** [东南乡神仙],\nAnd the **Numinous Officials** [诸灵官].\nWe **humble ourselves**, trusting in **divine mercy** [仰冀圣慈赦宥],\nThat

moisten** [清渊云润],\nNurturing our **reverent and composed thoughts** [沃念虑之恭庄].\nThus may we **preserve the True Essence of life** [使保全性命之真],\nAnd **harmonize with the unity of Heaven and humanity** [遂和同天人之际].\nMay the **Divine Followers of the Talismans** [随符仙从] and **Numinous Protective Officials** [护法灵官]\nRecord our **meritorious service** [录显绩之服劳],\nAnd **advocate for our Daoic ascension**

Others**\n\nWe, the humble ones, hear that **Heaven’s decree is supremely orderly** [承天至顺],\nAnd **Yang vigor shapes existence** [配刚健以成形];\nThe **Earth’s reach is boundless** [行地无疆],\nIts **encompassing virtue nurtures all** [扩含弘而役物].\n**Yin’s merit is immeasurable** [阴功莫大],\nAnd **great virtue is beyond name** [厚德难名].\n\nNow, we, the **Daoist adepts bearing talismans** [佩箓道士],\nEndowed with the **five elements’ refinement** [禀秀五行],\nPossessing **solitary numinous essence** [独灵万物],\nThough born of dust, we **entered the Dao’s gate** [均有生於尘世，幸入道於玄门],\nYet **should have cultivated self-transformation** [益宜自化以修心],\nSo as to **receive others with emptiness** [庶可虚含而接物].\n\nInstead, we **fail to govern our qi** [自以不能御气],\nAnd **yield to emotion** [动必纵情],\nOur **heart unharmonized, clashing with others** [不和其心而与物交争],\nOur **body unyielding, defying the world** [不顺其身而与世相忤].\nWe **lack enduring virtue** [无一德而为常安之术],\nAnd when **two passions meet, we spew malicious words** [合两怒则多溢恶之言].\nWe **defend our flaws, unaware of our own failings** [护短而己不自知],\nAnd **harbor grudges, though others resent us** [敛怨而人岂无憾].\nOur **errant thoughts harm the harmonious qi** [缪於心而伤和气],\nAnd our **reckless speech defiles the Daoic body** [溺於言而污法身].\nWe **stand beside others yet fail to transform them** [与人并立而无以化人],\nAnd though we **nourish the form with false Dao** [伪道养形],\nWe **have not yet attained the Dao itself** [未能造道].\n\nWe **dare not deceive ourselves** [敢昧自欺之过],\nLest we **invite Heaven’s retribution** [以贻天降之殃].\nWe **confess our guilt first** [敬负罪以首陈],\nAnd **solemnly vow to amend** [誓责躬而悛改].\n\nWith **incense, flowers, and offerings of faith** [谨赍香花法信供养之仪],\nWe **devoutly submit** to the **West-Southward Supreme Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure** [无极太上灵宝天尊],\nThe **Celestial Qi Sovereign** [梵炁天君],\nThe **West-Southward Immortal Deities** [西南乡神仙],\nAnd the **Numinous Officials** [诸灵官].\nWe **trust in the Receptive’s perfect fidelity** [仰惟坤仪至信],\nAnd the **Earth’s Dao of humility** [地道流谦],\nHoping to **share in the radiant virtue of bearing all** [愿分厚德载物之休光],\nThat we may **constantly practice saving others** [使有常善救人之功用].\nMay our **Daoic nature be pure and luminous** [虚明道性],\nAnd **all contradictions harmonized** [一顺逆以和融];\nMay our **refined thoughts and speech be steadfast** [粹熟心声],\nAnd our **mechanisms of conduct be stable** [谨枢机而安定].\nMay **blessings naturally arrive** [福将自至],\nAnd **calamity find no cause to arise** [祸莫由生].\nWe further **pray for unshakable compassion** [更祈不动之仁],\nAnd **complete forgiveness for past transgressions** [尽赦从前之罪].\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend to the **Formless**,\nAnd harmonize with the **True**.\n\n---\n\n**West-Northward Repentance for Misusing Heaven’s Symbols and Earth’s Patterns in Invoking Spirits**\n\nWe, the humble ones, hear that the **Supreme Ultimate contains the Three** [太极含三],\nAnd the **Two Principles divide to establish order** [两仪判而定位];\nThe **Heavenly Principle manifests the Nine** [乾元用九],\nAnd **all things perceive and take form** [万物睹而流形].\nWith **One Qi preserved in purity** [得一气以贞纯],\nWe **ride the Flying Dragon without ceasing** [御飞龙而不息],\n**Unfolding into the trigrams** [发挥入卦],\nAnd **preserving the Great Harmony** [保合太和].\n\nNow, we, the **Daoist adepts bearing talismans** [佩箓道士],\nWith **lofty aspirations for the Mysterious** [宅志希夷],\nAnd **hearts wandering in the boundless** [游心浩素],\nStore **divine essence within** [内存神而炼道]\nAnd **practice teaching to transform others** [外行教以化人].\nThough the **ritual implements exist** [虽科法之具存],\nThey are **not the task of the common** [岂凡庸之是任].\n\nYet, with **form and spirit most impure** [重以形神至浊],\nAnd **Daoic practice unheard** [道行无闻],\nWe **adorn our caps with star patterns** [攒星斗於峨冠],\nAnd **embellish our robes with cloud-and-mist designs** [饰云霞於羽服].\nWe **tread upon the Pole Star’s might** [蹑魁罡於履屐之下],\nYet our **roots are earthly and our deeds mundane** [地秽人凡];\nWe **command spirits and ghosts** [驱神鬼於掌握之中],\nYet our **merit is slight and virtue thin** [功微德薄].\nWe **tread the Eight Trigrams’ patterns on the altar** [践八卦之文於坛墠],\nAnd **descend the Ten Directions’ qi into our bodies** [降十方之气於身田].\nSometimes we **nurture the prenatal breath in the Three Primordials** [或养胎息於三元],\n**Stealing the essence of Yin and Yang** [暗窃阴阳之气];\nSometimes we **refine the inner elixir in the Nine Transformations** [或炼内丹於九转],\n**Chasing the light of sun and moon** [高奔日月之光].\nWe are **no true Daoist forms** [素非仙相之人],\nYet **presume to learn the Saints’ great deeds** [冒学圣功之道].\n**No act is without presumption** [无非僭越],\nAnd **we have offended the Radiant Spirits** [有犯光灵].\nWe **now humbly confess our transgressions** [敬伸忏谢之诚],\nSeeking to **atone for our faults** [以这谴尤之责].\n\nWith **incense, flowers, and offerings of faith** [谨赍香花法信供养之仪],\nWe **devoutly submit** to the **West-Northward Supreme Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure** [无极太上灵宝天尊],\nThe **Celestial Qi Sovereign** [梵炁天君],\nThe **West-Northward Immortal Deities** [西北乡神仙],\nAnd the **Numinous Officials** [诸灵官].\nWe **trust in the Heavenly Principle’s vigor** [仰惟乾元至健],\nAnd that **Heaven’s Dao is not defied** [天道弗违].\nMay we be **granted pure Yang** [锡以纯阳],\nTo **exchange our earthly, vulgar bones** [为换尘凡之胎骨];\n\n「Revealing the essential Dao/Way, so that one may know the fundamental source of **transformation into Immortality** [仙化].\n**The Four Bodies** [四体] are harmonious and at peace,\n**The Hundred Spirits** [百神] are firmly ensconced.\nThus, **all who diligently cultivate the Higher Laws** [庶精修於上法]\nMay achieve **no shame in their prior merits** [得无愧於前功].\n\nAfter attaining the Dao/Way,\nOne ascends into **Formlessness** [无形],\nAnd **harmony unites with the True Dao/Way** [和与道合真].\n**We of the lower realms** [下方] now confess our transgressions:\nFrom ages past, we have **offended the Three Radiant Lights** [冒犯三光],\nIgnorant of the **Heavenly Covering** [覆载].\n**All of us** [众等] have heard in awe:\n**Brahmanic Qi** [梵炁] extends to **Maha-Brahman** [弥罗],\nReaching the **Supreme Void** [上极虚无] of the highest realm.\nThe **Primordial Principles** [元纲] flow and manifest,\nTransforming into **the myriad eons of Heaven** [化开万亿之天].\n\n**Oh, the Venerable Dao/Way’s grandeur** [洪惟至道之尊]!\nIt governs **the Natural Transformations** [统御自然之化],\nIts **Divine Powers** [神功] are everlasting,\nAnd **its vast efficacy** [浩劫] endures eternally.\n\nNow, **we humble Daoist officials bearing talismans** [有佩箓道士某等],\nFrom **the beginningless** [无始] to the **manifested** [有形],\nHave **one numinous essence** [一灵] diminished and lost,\nUnable to return to the **five primordial purities** [五太之淳].\n**The Six Bandits** [六贼] have clouded our minds,\nBringing upon ourselves the **karmic burdens of the Three Realms** [三生之业].\n\nWe have **soared beyond the Desire Realm and Form Realm** [超於欲界色界],\nYet **fallen back into the Wheel of Rebirth** [复堕轮回].\nWe have **practiced the causes of the Lesser and Middle Vehicles** [修於小乘中乖],\nYet **ourselves generated decline and backsliding** [自生退转].\nSome have **dwelled in the Central Lands** [居中土] but **failed to return to their origins** [本原不返],\nOthers have **journeyed to distant realms** [处殊方] yet **the Dao/Way’s teachings remain unheard** [声教无闻].\n\nThe **Great Vehicle’s Dao/Way** [大乘之道] is hard to fulfill,\nAnd the **karmic cycles of the Three Realms** [三界之业] are easily perpetuated.\n**Bearing Heaven above and Earth below** [戴天履地],\n**Embracing Yin and Yang** [负阴抱阳],\nWe have **failed to repay the Heavenly Grace** [莫酬覆焘之恩],\nAnd **every action brings guilt and offense** [动有乖张之罪].\n\nWe have **missed the four seasons’ harmonious shifts** [四序寒暄之愆],\nAnd **lament the Heavenly timing** [嗟怨天时].\nWe have **contradicted the luminous courses of the Three Celestial Marks** [逆三辰经纬之昭明],\nAnd **offended the Radiant Dao/Way’s light** [犯冲光景].\n\nOur **sins span countless lifetimes** [逆数千生之罪],\nAnd **our transgressions fill myriad kinds** [贯盈万种之愆].\nFrom this day onward, **we seek renewal** [自此自新],\nAnd **pray for Your boundless forgiveness** [愿垂肆赦].\n\nWith **incense, flowers,

of the Immortals** [玉京仙都],\nThe **Purple Forbidden Enclosure and Golden Celestial Gate** [紫微金阙],\nThe **Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms** [三清三界],\nThe **Celestial Qi Sovereign** [梵炁天君],\nThe **Divine Deities of the Upper Realm** [上乡神仙],\nAnd the **Numinous Officials** [诸灵官].\n\nWe **aspire to the Great Dao/Way’s benevolent proclamation** [仰冀大道宣慈],\nAnd **pray for the High True Ones’ compassionate regard** [高真垂悯].\nMay You **forgive the ten directions’ worlds** [下十方之世界],\nAnd **pardon our myriad eons of transgression** [赦万劫之愆尤].\n\n**Purple Forbidden and Supreme Mysterious** [紫微太微],\n**Urge the auspicious moment for ascension** [催促举仙之运].\n**Southern and Northern Dipper** [南斗北斗],\n**Dispel the calamities of our lifespans** [解消临命之灾].\n\nMay **our Primordial Essence** [元精] be **full within the Mudball** [满於泥丸],\nAnd **our True Qi** [真炁] be **congealed in the Numinous Palace** [凝於灵府].\nMay **Divine Light** [神明] **descend and dwell** within us,\nAnd **our organs and

**receive the descent of the Perfect Ones** [得至人之降接],\nAnd be **guided in the profound mysteries of Daoist learning** [指道学之玄微].\nMay we **transform all sentient beings** [回化有情],\nAnd **together ascend to the state of Non-Defilement** [同登无漏].\n\nAfter attaining the Dao/Way,\nOne **ascends into Formlessness** [升入无形],\nAnd **harmony unites with the True Dao/Way** [和与道合真].\n**We of the lower realms** [下方] now confess our transgressions:\n**Harming living beings and injuring life** [害物伤生之罪].\n\nThe multitude humbly hears that the Great Square without corners\nExpands the eight strings and bears them thickly;\nThe Original Form governs the earth, containing all things to transform and give birth.\n\nNow, the sovereign of the Later Soil, who holds authority,\nDistributes the duties of the hundred spirits.\nWithout speech, yet trustworthy—\nWith One, all is at peace.\n\nNow, we, the humble Daoist adepts bearing talismans, certain in name,\nWere born in the chaos of the beginning,\nLost the Dao in the aftermath of Honghuang.\nRen, yi, li, zhi arose alongside great falsehood;\nThe wise and foolish, the good and evil, received their nature from Heaven’s spontaneity.\nWe were born as those who abandoned the root,\nOur actions ever stained by greed for life.\nWe rely on all things for sustenance,\nYet fail to recognize the恩 of the covering and bearing.\nWe indulge our selfish ease,\nUnmindful of those who suffer hunger and cold.\nWe gluttonously indulge in desires of mouth and belly,\nAnd recklessly harm living beings.\nWe flaunt the beauty of adornments and luxuries,\nAnd wrongly destroy the formed.\nWe know not to turn inward,\nAnd this becomes our habitual nature.\n\nThe five peaks and four great rivers hold records of our crimes—\nA tangled web of offenses.\nThe officials of the Black Registers and the Yin Valley\nPile up our dark deeds.\n\nFortunately, in this age, we take refuge under the Dao’s shelter,\nConfessing our myriad sins of past lives before the Mysterious Tribunal,\nVowing to cultivate the future,\nHoping to reach a state without fault.\n\nWith solemn offerings of incense, flowers, and the rites of faith,\nWe wholeheartedly submit to the **Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerable of the Lower Realm’s Limitless Extremes**,\nThe High Sovereign of the Nine Soils,\nThe Twelve Immortals,\nThe Most Numinous Later Soil,\nThe Four Great Rivers and Five Peaks,\nThe Lower Realm’s world,\nAll Immortals and Spirits,\nAll Numinous Officials.\n\nWe humbly pray that all spirits respond to our sincerity,\nThat their virtue is vast and their mercy boundless,\nThat they extend the boundless grace of forgiveness,\nPardon our boundless transgressions,\nAnd awaken compassionate intentions,\nUnleashing the source of blessings.\n\nMay stillness and gentleness prevail,\nHarmonizing with all without obstruction;\nMay emptiness and purity be attained,\nSwiftly realizing the Dao and attaining longevity.\n\nFrom the highest reaches of the Azure Palace to the deepest depths of the Yellow Springs,\nMay all return to their roots,\nAnd all things flourish in life.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao,\nOne ascends into Formlessness,\nAnd harmony unites with the True Dao.\n\n*The Dao Gate’s Comprehensive Regulations, Volume Seventy-Four ends.\nThe Dao Gate’s Comprehensive Regulations, Volume Seventy-Five begins.*\n\nMay the teachings of Master Guangcheng (杜光庭) be followed,\n*The Ritual of Ascension and Divine Transformation at the Upper Clarity Dao/Way Hall of the Transcended Immortals*\nThis ritual employs the **Yellow Arrow** (黄箓) to cultivate the True Dao of the Ten Precepts (十戒),\nand the **Hosted Initiation** (明真宿启) to perform the rites—\nthe ancient rites of the Five Refining (五炼) for generating the sacred body (生尸).\n\nThe **Hosted Initiation** (宿启) is thus the means\nto invoke the souls of those who have been **transcended and drawn forth** (迁拔),\nor **extinguished and liberated** (灭度).\n\nMaster Wanfu (万福天师) composed

attire, with **headdresses and trailing ribbons**. Open the **Mysterious Platform’s Earth and Domain Spirits**.\n\nToday, as I perform the midday Dao/Way practice, I sincerely offer this with utmost devotion. My sincerity has been recorded and reported. May the **Most High Ten-Direction True Dao/Way qi** and the **Numinous Treasure Auspicious Light** descend and flow into my body, so that my petitions may swiftly reach the presence of the **Most High Boundless Dao/Way, the Jade Emperor of the Broad Heaven, and the Eastern Pole Saving-Suffering Green Heavenly Emperor**.\n\n**Invoke the Law Position**.\n\nI, **Subject of Rank [X]**, along with the assembled officials of the platform, humbly and sincerely petition:\nThe **Void-Natural Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable One**, the **Most High Dao/Way Lord**, the **Most High Venerable Lord**, the **Jade Emperor of the Broad Heaven**, the **Hook-Array Heavenly Emperor**, the **Northern Pole Worthy of the Purple Micro**, the **Southern Pole Life-Granting Emperor**, the **Eastern Pole Saving-Suffering Green Heavenly Emperor**, the **Heaven-Supporting Earth-Modeling Sovereign of the Yellow Soil**, the **Ten-Direction Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerables**, the **Heavenly Venerables**, the **Heavenly Emperors**, the **Upper Clarity Sun-Moon-Stars-Constellations-River-Han Host of True Ones**, the **Three Officials and Four Saints**, the **Five Teachers and Three Provincial True Lords**, the **Nine Heavenly Celestial Bureaucrats**, the **True Lords of All Ranks**, the **Transmitted Lineage and Doctrine-Granting Great Masters**, the **Thunder-Peal Spirit-Tiger Heavenly Physicians and All Officials**, the **Most High Ranked Scriptures and Talismans’ Immortal Officials and Clerks**, the **Named-Mountain Cave-Dwellings’ Dao-Achieving Immortals**, the **Underworld Acid-Field Emperor**, the **Yin-Spirits’ Holy Assembly**, the **Water Realm’s Eastern-Soaring Emperor**, the **Lingyuan True Immortals**, the **Five Peaks and Five Heavens’ Holy Emperors**, the **Acid-Field Earth Spirits**, the **Grand Marshal of the Five Elements**, the **Yearly Stem-Branch Earth-Fire**, the **Temperate Official’s Holy Assembly**, the **Prefectural-County City Deities**, the **Local Temple and Shrine Spirits**, the **Blessed Court’s Earthly True Officials**, the **Law Platform’s All Officials**, the **Three Realms’ Soul-Extracting Spirit-Clerks**, the **Four Realms’ Direct-Talisman Functionaries**, the **Petition-Recording Money-Spirit Clerks**, the **Ritual Feast’s Sovereigns**, and **All True Immortals**.\n\nWith reverence, we gaze upon your boundless mercy and profound discernment.\n\nWe, born of mortal form in the Central Land, endowed with ordinary nature, by the fate of past virtues, encountering the Dao/Way’s auspicious age, though of lowly station, may partake in the True. Refining qi and congealing spirit, yet still deficient in True stillness, wandering in thought—we have not yet grasped the Mysterious Void.\n\nNow, my disciple **X**, relying on my former teacher **Y**, all share the same past gathering. Our bonds are as vast as heaven’s cover and earth’s load, our ranks ordained since birth. Ascension and decline in transformation—it is only right to recommend and elevate them, as decreed by the Celestial Edict. With utmost sincerity, we humbly implore the Mysterious Ford, praying for auspicious aid.\n\nToday, by the decree of the Word, we dare not fail to report it.\n\n**Proclaim the Word**.\n\nAs the Word states, our devotion is profound and sincere.\n\nDisciple **X**, with the transformation of my former teacher **Y**, once received the Mysterious Strategy, dwelling in the Dao/Way’s domain, yet his virtuous deeds were not manifest, his immortal name unrecorded, his lifespan measured—he passed away in the natural course. Grief-stricken and sorrowful, we earnestly pray, solemnly preparing the ritual platform to perform the fast and rectitude.\n\nWe have carefully examined the ritual precepts, broadly constructing this bridge, so that this departing soul may be extinguished from the wheel of rebirth.\n\nNow, as we perform the midday Dao/Way practice, we request the assembled ritualists to light **the first incense strand**, wishing this incense smoke to ascend directly to the heavens and offer itself to the **Three Venerable Ones of the Great Dao/Way**. With utmost sincerity, we **take refuge in body, spirit, and fate**, dedicating these merits to pray for the Emperor’s eternal longevity, the prosperity of the ancestral temple, the enduring blessing of the imperial lineage, and the peace of the realm.\n\nMay the **Three Teachers and Nine Ancestors**, the people of the land, and all who receive the Mysterious Grace attain the Dao/Way.\n\nToday, we light this incense and **take refuge in the Venerable Ones’ True and Most High Virtue**. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True.\n\nNow, as we perform the midday Dao/Way practice, we request the assembled ritualists to light **the second incense strand**, wishing this incense smoke to ascend directly to the heavens and offer itself to the **Most High Venerable Scripture**. With utmost sincerity, we **take refuge in body, spirit, and fate**, dedicating these merits to **Disciple X**, dissolving his offenses, absolving his transgressions, freeing him from the Nine Yin Prisons and the Five Suffering Courts, so that he may no longer wander in the cycle of birth, eternally receiving blessings, ultimately attaining the Dao/Way, enduring blissful non-action, extending even to the submerged and forgotten, encompassing all sentient beings within the nine boundaries—all relying on this vast mercy to achieve the Dao/Way’s transformation.\n\nToday, we light this incense and **take refuge in the Scripture-Venerable Ones’ True and Most High Virtue**. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True.\n\nNow, as we perform the midday Dao/Way practice, we request the assembled ritualists to light **the third incense strand**, wishing this incense smoke to ascend directly to the heavens and offer itself to the **Most High Three Teachers**.\n\nWe, Your humble servants, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in body, spirit, and life—devoting these merits to disciple [name] and all descendants. The True *qi* lies dormant as latent treasure, while the Perfected One descends to receive. Within, the *yuan* and *qi* congeal into purity; without, malevolent forces are repelled. The Northern Palace extends the year of boundless ease, while the Southern Bureau records the register of eternal life. Grievances dissolve, debts are reconciled, and harmony spreads through the nine clans, all peoples under heaven, both seen and unseen, and all living things—all sharing in this boundless blessing.\n\nNow, we again light incense and take refuge in the Teacher-Venerable Ones’ Most High and True Virtue. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True.\n\n**Repentance, command the demon, and step upon the void**—three rites performed. We humbly repeat the sacred ranks.\n\nWe, Your devoted servants [name] and the assembled ritual officials, with utmost sincerity and reverence, address:\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Natural Void,\nThe Most High Dao/Way Lord,\nThe Most High Venerable Lord Lao,\nThe Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven,\nThe Heavenly Sovereign of the Gourd Cluster,\nThe Grand Imperial Sovereign of the Northern Pole,\nThe Grand Imperial Sovereign of the Southern Pole,\nThe Supreme Saviour of the Eastern Pole,\nThe Earthly Sovereign who follows Heaven’s law,\nThe Highest Celestial Worthies of the Round Canopy,\nThe Royal Governors of the Four Quarters,\nAll Spirits and Saints, both past and present,\nAll True Celestials assembled at this ritual feast—\n\nWe humbly pray for Your boundless compassion and Your penetrating insight.\n\nBy fortune and merit, we have partaken in the True Transformation. The secrets of the Celestial Scriptures were early attained through practice. Examining the True Scriptures, we deeply understand their teachings. The Teacher’s grace is most profound, equal to that of a heavenly kin—one who turns the Wheel of Life and Death. Thus, we must solemnly offer this petition.\n\nNow, we dare to submit our plea: Your disciple [name] humbly acknowledges that our revered Celestial Master [name]—through virtuous causes—once attained the True Rank, wore the lofty mysteries, and revered the True One. Yet, our Celestial Rank remains incomplete, worldly toil unsettled, and suddenly bound by sickness and calamity, we nearly perished. Though all things must end, the fault lies with later generations, whose recklessness we now regret too late. The suffering is unbearable, and we fear our accumulated sins may hinder the Master’s ascension. We seek repentance to benefit both the living and the dead.\n\nYour disciples [name], from countless kalpas past, since taking birth, have:\n- Betrayed sovereigns and parents, failing to honor our elders;\n- Abandoned truth for falsehood, betraying teachers and deceiving friends;\n- Committed murder and cruelty, harming the innocent, envying the virtuous, and slighting kin;\n- Consumed life-bearing substances, violated purity, misused sacred scriptures, and blasphemed the Celestial Worthies, deceiving even our own forms;\n- Misinterpreted sacred teachings, recklessly revealing Heaven’s secrets, violating rites, and defying celestial decrees;\n- Practiced deceit, acted unjustly, enriched ourselves while neglecting kin;\n- Broken vows, violated precepts, and transgressed the Mystic Arts—failing humanity below and the scriptures above. Our names are inscribed in the Black Register, our merits lost in the Blue Ledger. Our sins have led to annihilation, and our misdeeds have brought ruin upon our teachers.\n\nIn the endless night of darkness, where has our vital essence gone? Without confession, how could we hope for salvation?\n\nNow, through fasting and Dao/Way practice, we repent our errors, seeking to purge both the living and the dead of their transgressions.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Most High Dao/Way and the Venerable Worthies command the Twenty-Seven Prisons of the Underworld and the One Hundred Twenty Departments of Yin-Yang Water-Fire to erase the karmic debts of seven lifetimes, granting us broad pardon, releasing our forms and spirits, and allowing us to be reborn in the Central Realm, receiving *qi* of wisdom. May we uphold the Mystic Arts, propagate the sacred teachings, become teachers for humanity and gods, and realize the Dao/Way of the Void.\n\nNext, we pray for the longevity of the Emperor, the unity of ministers, the harmonization of all under heaven, and the alignment of the eight directions. May all realms of suffering and the nine layers of darkness witness the light, free from all torment. May all creatures, great and small, across the land, share in this boundless grace and ascend to the shores of blessing.\n\nMay this illuminate the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion above and reflect our sincere repentance below. We humbly submit this petition.\n\n**Twelve Wishes Completed. The Incense Altar is Rekindled.**\n\nWe solemnly command the incense officials, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit officials to gather at the place where we performed the midday Dao/Way practice. There, gold elixir and jade-green pills shall spontaneously arise, along with herbs and hundred-spirits’ blessings, as the Celestial Worthies converge before this incense altar.\n\nWe pray that the Celestial Maiden and Boy attendants of the Ten Directions receive the fragrant smoke and swiftly convey our sincere petition to the presence of:\n- The Most High Dao/Way of the Boundless,\n- The Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven,\n- The Supreme Saviour of the Eastern Pole.\n\n**The Assembly Recites the Praise. The Ritual Hall is Exited.**\n\n**Daoist Rituals Comprehensive Collection, Volume Seventy-Six Complete**\n**Daoist Rituals Comprehensive Collection, Volume Seventy-Seven**\n\n**Ritual of the Upper Clarity Dao/Way’s Ascension and Transformation for the Departed Spirits**\n\n**Evening Dao/Way Practice**\n\nThe ritual assembly ascends the platform as prescribed. Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the Dao/Way’s teachings. The sacred incantations are proclaimed, and the divine light shines brightly, while auspicious *qi* swirls in abundance. The celestial tripod and dipper [箕斗] cast their radiance, and the sacred grove [芝宇] lies serene. The jade pupils [玉眸] hold the true essence, and the precious altar [宝坛] remains pure and dry. The night transforms into day, and the cycle returns to midday. The Great Summit [太华] flows with pearls, and the vermilion phoenix [丹凤] soars in the *Xuan* [玄].\n\nThe evil spirits are quelled, and the wicked are extinguished. With lofty steps, we ascend amid fragrant smoke. The Celestial Worthies gather in full, all arriving before the Emperor’s presence, merging with the Dao/Way’s true essence.\n\nThe sacred drum [法鼓] is struck twenty-four times.\n\nWe summon the Most High Dao/Way of the Boundless, the Three Primordial *Qi* [三炁] of the Heavenly Origin, the Supreme Dao/Way Lord, the Supreme Old Lord, and the following officials from within our bodies:\n- The Three Five Functionaries [三五功曹],\n- The Left and Right Officials,\n- The Left and Right Incense Bearers,\n- The Relay Dragons and Mounted Bridesmen [驿龙骑吏],\n- The Golden Boy Attendants of Incense,\n- The Jade Girl Scatterers of Flowers,\n- The Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols,\n- The Direct Day Incense Officials,\nand all thirty-six in total.\n\nThose who emerge are clad in solemn and dignified robes, their headgear and ribbons hanging in proper order. They open the gates of the Mystic Daoist Altars [玄坛] and the local deities [土地], as well as the regional spirit officials [方域神真].\n\nNow, as the sun sets and we perform the Dao/Way practice, we humbly offer this as our heartfelt intention. All our earnest entreaties have already been recorded and presented. We pray that the Supreme Dao/Way’s true essence of the Ten Directions, the Sacred Treasure and Auspicious Light, descend and enter our bodies, so that our petitions may swiftly reach the presence of:\n- The Most High Dao/Way of the Boundless,\n- The Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven,\n- The Eastern Pole’s Supreme Saviour of the Green *Xuan*.\n\nWe request the proclamation of the sacred ranks.\n\nWe, the undersigned [具位臣某] and all the assembled ritual officials, sincerely present this petition together. To the Heavenly Venerable of the Natural Void, the Supreme Dao/Way Lord, the Supreme Old Lord, the Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven, the Hook-and-Arrow Heavenly Sovereign, the Great Purple Emperor of the Northern Pole, the Southern Pole Emperor of the Vital Breath, the Eastern Pole’s Supreme Saviour of the Green *Xuan*, the Earthly Sovereign of the Posterior Soil who follows Heaven’s law, the Supreme Venerable of the Ten Directions’ Sacred Treasure, the Heavenly Venerables of all realms, the Heavenly Emperors of all realms, the Upper Clarity Worthies of the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Milky Way, the Three Officials and Four Saints, the Five Masters and Three Provincial Spirit Lords, the Nine Heavenly Celestial Functionaries, all the Spirit Lords, the Great Masters of successive generations who uphold the Dao/Way’s lineage and teachings, the Thunder and Lightning Spirit Tigers and Heavenly Physicians of all departments, the Daoist officials and officers from the Supreme Scriptures and Ordinances, the named mountain and cave deities who have attained the Dao/Way, the Great Emperor of the Underworld, the Holy Multitude of the Netherworld, the Great Emperor of the Eastern Pole’s Exalted Phoenix, the True Worthies of the Langyan Palace, the Five Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks and Five Heavens, the Earthly Sovereign of the Netherworld, the General of the Ten Thousand *Gan*, the Grand Marshal of the Earthly Branches, the Sacred Multitude of the *Wen* Command, the deities of the prefectures and counties, the city gods, the local spirit officials of the auspicious courtyard, the ritual officers of all departments, the Three Realms’ deities who extract souls and seize spirits, the Four Realms’ direct symbols and functionaries, the scribes who record and present petitions, the deities presiding over the *Jiao* feast, and all the seated True Worthies.\n\nWith reverence, we gaze upon Your boundless compassion and profound discernment. We, Your devoted disciples, have long benefited from Your sacred grace, drawing upon the pure *qi* to return to the Dao/Way’s transformation and partake in the true winds. Through the hidden precepts and sacred texts, the profound rituals and wondrous doctrines, we have attained harmony and enlightenment. Heaven’s blessings are vast and deep.\n\nYet, this disciple [弟子某], through the Master’s personal bond, once by fate’s convergence, was held in high regard by the Dao/Way’s teachings and prioritized in the Master’s true instructions. Together, we have transcended life and death, ascending and descending, guiding one another toward the Dao/Way. Now, in obedience to Your sacred words, we dare not fail to present this petition. The words are proclaimed.\n\nAs per the words spoken, our devotion is profound and sincere. We fear that our former Master, having ascended to the Daoist transformation, may wonder where our spiritual awareness resides. Their radiant presence has fled, and their voice and form are distant. Previously, we dwelled in the turbid world, now taking refuge in the Mystic Daoist Gate. Our practice is incomplete, our cultivation often neglected, and we struggle to transcend the Dao’s realm, still hindered by the Netherworld’s path. Our body has passed beyond the Three Officials’ jurisdiction, and we suffer the torments of all spirits. In these dark nights, our sorrow is genuine and deep.\n\nThus, we adhere to the ritual precepts and solemnly proceed together, following the Daoist teachings and venerating the true essence. We rely on Your grace to open the path and pray to repay the force that gave us life. We prepare the incense with utmost reverence, hoping to express our earnest aspiration. We purify our thoughts and focus our minds, devoutly observing the *Jiao* feast and its strictures.\n\nWith this evening’s Dao/Way practice, we request the ritual assembly to take this first pinch of incense and offer it upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, paying homage to the Three Supreme Venerables. We surrender our body, spirit, and fate, dedicating these merits to the ancestral temples, the spirits of the earth, and the celestial Worthies. May our virtuous *qi* rise to the Nine Pure [九清] and our spirits ride the clouds to the Eight Extremes [八极]. May Your blessings descend upon us, protecting our nation and bringing peace to its people.\n\nMay the Emperor of the Northern Pole extend longevity, and the Southern Mountain Emperor bestow prosperity upon all. May the world be at peace and harmony prevail within and without. May the court be filled with virtuous ministers, and the countryside have no abandoned talents. May all under heaven follow the Dao/Way’s transformation, uniting in the harmony of non-action.\n\nNow, through this act of burning incense, we have taken refuge in the Supreme Scriptures and the Great Saints’ true essence. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless and merge with the Dao’s true essence.\n\nWith this evening’s Dao/Way practice, we request the ritual assembly to take this second pinch of incense and offer it upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, paying homage to the Supreme Venerable Scriptures. We surrender our body, spirit, and fate, dedicating these merits to our former Master [先师某].\n\nMay the True Vehicle guide and protect us, and the Most Holy preserve and uphold us. May we bathe in the divine fire’s court and refine our spirits in the realm of penetrating *yang*. May we ascend to the jade gates of the True Worthies and receive the name in the Pearl Palace. May we praise the Dao/Way’s compassionate winds and open the path of wisdom for all beings.\n\nTogether with the Nine *Xuan* and Seven Ancestors, the Masters of scriptures and ordination, the upholders and monitors of the alliance, and the mountain-dwelling kindred spirits, may we all share in the blessings of victory and ascend to the true stages.\n\nNow, through this act of burning incense, we have taken refuge in the Supreme Scriptures and the Great Saints’ true essence. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless and merge with the Dao’s true essence.\n\nAs the sun now sets, ascending the platform to practice the Dao/Way, we humbly request the assembled Dharma assembly to kindle these three strands of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend the celestial path, offering reverence to the Most High Three Masters.\n\nWe, the disciples, take refuge with body, spirit, and life, and with these merits, dedicate them to the lineage of our teacher [Name], extending blessings to our countless ancestors and kindred spirits, both living and departed. May the living inherit the resources of fortune and protection, while the deceased attain the grace of ascension.\n\nTo all within the revolving heavens and the eight extremes, to all sentient beings of earth and plant, to the Nine Nights and Three Paths, to wandering souls and stagnant spirits—may they all receive the Most High’s proclaimed benevolence and be bathed in the True One’s salvific grace, achieving boundless ease and eternal auspiciousness.\n\nNow, through this act of burning incense, we take refuge in the Teacher’s supreme virtue and the Great Saints’ true essence. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless and merge with the Dao’s true essence.\n\n**Repentance completed.**\n*East Azure, West White, South Vermilion, North Dark*—valid for all three watches.\n\nWe have heard that the Mysterious Dao responds to all circumstances and attends to every sentiment. The Celestial Sovereign’s boundless aid extends mercy in response to thought. Repentance clears the threefold karma, and atonement opens the Nine Abysses to prosperity.\n\nNow, through this turning of the scriptures and practice of the Dao/Way, we bow in homage to the Ten Directions’ Limitless Supreme, the Soul-Treasury Celestial Worthy, the Three Lights and Five Peaks, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, and the Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures. We, disciple [Name], with our teacher [Name], sever worldly dust and ascend the True Path.\n\nReflecting on past lifetimes and this very existence, from birth onward, we have accumulated merits and demerits—sometimes practicing compassion to save beings and teaching to guide people, yet violating scriptural precepts and transgressing prohibitions; sometimes applying Daoist methods while yielding to human emotions, favoring or resenting by circumstance, fostering grudges; sometimes constructing observatories, diverting waters, or tunneling mountains, disturbing dragon spirits and felling trees, leaving some harmed while others prospered, merits turning to faults. Or in transmitting the Dharma and teaching scriptures, disregarding proper timing, where kindness became a burden to the Dao and good intentions led to error. The Five Emperors and Four Officials have not granted pardon, and the Three Officials and Nine Departments still strike our offenses, confining us in dark prisons with no means of liberation.\n\nThrough this fasting and Daoist practice, we now confess our faults and seek mercy, hoping to purge countless transgressions. May the Three Venerable Saints respond to our sincere pleas, descend boundless grace, and forgive boundless guilt. Whether great or small, may all be cleansed.\n\nThus, may our names be erased from the Red Register, our sins expunged from the Black Ledger, the Dark Moon refined, and our souls ascend to the Vermilion Palace. May we traverse the Wheel of Fortune, attain True Rank, fulfill the Dao’s fruit, and forever escape the cycle of transformation.\n\nTo all ancestors, living and deceased, across countless generations, may they receive blessings, and all sentient beings share in honor. May the Dao’s light spread, benefiting future disciples, perpetually turning the Wheel of Teaching and magnifying divine transformation.\n\nOur petitions and supplications are now presented to the Mysterious Insight. May past karmic calamities dissolve, and present blessings descend.\n\nAbove, may the Celestial Sovereign’s benevolent grace be manifest; below, may our sincere homage be fulfilled. We humbly submit this prayer.\n\n**Twelve Vows completed.**\n*Restoration of the incense burner.*\n\nWe solemnly command the incense officers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Officers, and the attendant spirit officials of incense: May they now cause gold elixirs and jade-green herbs, as well as all hundred spirits, to naturally arise at the place where we previously set the sun and practiced the Dao. May the Ten Directions’ immortal youths and jade maidens attend the fragrant smoke, swiftly conveying our sincere petitions to the Supreme Limitless Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault, and the Sovereign of the Eastern Pole, the Green Celestial Emperor Who Saves from Suffering, before the Celestial Throne.\n\n**Exit the hall in praise.**\n**Depart the door.**\n\n**Dao/Way Gate Ritual Codes Complete Volume Seventy-Seventh Concluded**\n**Dao/Way Gate Ritual Codes Complete Volume Seventy-Eighth**\n*Upper Clarity Ascension-Transformation Ritual for Daoist Deities and Spirits*\n*Establishing a Ritual Feast and Practicing the Dao*\n\nThe Ritual Platform is raised as prescribed.\nEach pays homage to the Master in accordance with the Dao/Way.\n\nProclaim the sacred incantations of protection.\nThe Five Stars align in radiance, illuminating the Five Directions.\nThe Water Star repels calamities, the Wood Star brings prosperity.\nThe Upholder Star (Yinghuò) dissipates misfortune, the Great White Star (Taibai) wards off soldiers.\nThe Settling Star (Zhenxing) secures fourfold blessings, benefiting family and state.\n\nNames inscribed upon jade tablets, words recorded in the Imperial Registry.\nRiding the gusts, scattering the radiance, soaring through the boundless heavens.\nEntering and exiting the unseen realm, wandering and feasting in the Ten Directions.\nThe Five Clouds float as banners, summoning spirits and restraining winds.\nCommanding ten thousand spirits, guarding the Daoist Sage, uniting with the Dao/Way and achieving true essence.\n\nSound the **Law** drum **twenty-four times**.\nLight the incense burner.\n\nWe humbly invoke the Supreme Limitless Dao/Way of the **Highest Three Heavens**—the **Primordial Origin of the Three Qi (Trigrams)**, the **Supreme Dao Lord**, the **Supreme Old Lord**—to summon from our bodies the **Three Five Officials of Vitality**, the Left and Right Officers, the Left and Right Incense Bearers, the **Postal Dragon Cavalry**, the **Golden Boys Attending Incense**, the **Jade Maidens Scattering Flowers**, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**, the **Direct Day Incense Officers**, and the **Thirty-Six Combined Officials** to emerge.\n\nThose who exit shall don **auspicious attire and ceremonial robes**, with **headgear and trailing plumes**, opening the **Mysterious Gate** for the **Land Deities** and **Domain Spirits**.\n\nWe now establish this Ritual Feast to prolong the **Daoist Deities’ presence**, burning incense and practicing the Dao/Way, offering this with utmost sincerity. Our heartfelt petitions have already been recorded and presented. May the **Supreme Daoist Truths of the Ten Directions** descend as **Black Light**, the **Numinous Treasure’s Auspicious Radiance**, flowing into our bodies, so that our prayers may swiftly reach the **Supreme Limitless Dao/Way**, the **Celestial Vault Jade Emperor**, and the **Eastern Pole Green Celestial Emperor Who Saves from Suffering**.\n\n**First invocation of the Law position.**\nThe **named disciple** and the **assembled Ritual Platform officials**, with sincere devotion, present our petition to the **Virtuous and Limitless Dao Lord**, the **Supreme Dao Lord**, the **Supreme Old

Lords**, the **Nine Heavenly Celestial Registrars**, the **True Lords of All Positions**, the **Great Masters of Traditioned Lineage and Teaching**, the **Thunderous Tiger Heavenly Physicians and All

**Holy Multitudes of the Dark Realm**, the **Heavenly Emperor of the Eastern Pillar**, the **True Deities of the Lingyan Gardens**, the **Five Sacred Mountains and Five Heavenly Emperors of Humanity**, the **Acropolis Land Deity**, the **Commander-in-Chief of the Ten Thousands**, the **Yearly Sovereign of Earth and Fire**, the **Plague Officials**, the **City Deities of Provinces and Districts**, the **Ritual Platform Officials**, the **Three Realms’ Spirits of Soul and Life**, the **Four Realms’ Direct Talismans and Vitality Officials**, the **Recorded and Delivered Petitions of the Talisman Clerks**, the **Feast Master**, and **All True Deities**.\n\nWith reverent gaze, we behold the **Great Compassion** and **Piercing Insight**.\n\nWe have heard that the **Numinous Treasure** transmits the Dao/Way, its teachings profound and joyous.\nThe **Jade Circle** bestows scriptures, its oath to spread them far and wide.\nThe lineage of **Masters and Disciples** follows in succession, like ancient and modern lamps.\nFrom the heavens above to the realm of humanity, the Dao/Way is divided into **refined and profound** teachings.\nYet the **Highest True Ones** and the **novices** differ in their understanding and capacity.\nAll acknowledge that the Dao/Way has been transmitted, surpassing the **mechanisms of transformation and ascension**.\n\nThis disciple, serving as **Master** [name]’s successor, fears that though I have received the **auspicious Dao/Way**, I have not yet ascended.\nI rely upon the **Ritual Feast’s power** to beseech the **Ascension-Transformation of the Dao/Way**.\n\nWith **fragrant incense and pure offerings**, I invite the **True Ones’ presence** to this **sacred field**.\nI yearn for their **ascended wanderings**, hoping to witness the **radiant affairs** of the Dao/Way.\n\nThe **Jade Wheels and Feathered Canopies** drift through the **pure qi of the heavens**.\nThe **Moon Garments and Star Crowns** illuminate the **vast expanse of midnight**.\n\nI await the **gathering of the Hundred Spirits**, pointing toward the **Nine-Night Celestial Ferry**.\n\nWe, the disciple and the assembled officials, cannot contain our **eager reverence** in inviting and prolonging their presence.\nWe humbly welcome the **Holy Procession**.\n\n**Descent of the Holy Ones.**\nOffer tea.\n**First presentation.**\nScatter flowers.\n\n**Second invocation of the Law position.**\nThe **named disciple** and the **assembled Ritual Platform officials**, with renewed sincerity, present our petition to the **Nine Clarities’ Supreme Saints**, the **Three Caverns’ Masterly Lords**, and the **True Spirits of the Ten Directions and Three Realms**.\n\nWith reverent gaze, we behold the **Great Compassion** and **Piercing Insight**.\n\nWe have heard that the **Primordial Origin** of the **Hun-Dun** (Mystic Cavern) ascended westward with the **White Deer**.\nThe **Yellow Emperor** of the **Cauldron Lake** soared aloft upon the **Bearded Dragon**.\nAll sought **longevity** as their foundation, **repelling death** as their priority.\n\nThe Dao/Way’s **lofty mysteries** are tied to the **aspirations of humanity**.\nYet **laborious efforts** are like **embroidered silks**—difficult to achieve.\nThe **analogy of the rising wind** reminds us: if one does not **diligently cultivate the heart**, how can one **specialize in embracing the One**?\n\nTo **abandon oneself to desires**, indulge in **worldly affairs**, deepen **attachment to pleasures**—these lead to **decline and decay**.\nWhen **qi is lost** and **essence leaks**, when **blood fades** and **bones wither**,\nThe **Dao/Way’s vitality** gradually diminishes,\nAnd the **fate of one’s karma** accelerates.\n\nThis disciple, serving as **Master** [name]’s successor, though born in an **auspicious era** and **striking the Mystic Gate** with my name,\nThough I have **partially studied** the scriptures and teachings,\nMy **form and qi** remain unrefined.\nSuddenly, I have **followed the transformation** and **temporarily perished**,\nFearing that my **accumulated practices** have **many transgressions**,\nAnd that my **Daoist rank** has not yet been achieved,\nFor my **life’s path** still faces obstacles.\n\nI humbly rely upon the **Heavenly Lords’ teachings**, the **Supreme Old Lord’s codes**,\nFor there are **rituals of ascension and transformation** to achieve **Daoist transcendence**,\nAnd **methods of refining and purifying** to **revive the body**,\nSo that the **spirit may ascend to the Upper Realm**,\nAnd the **soul may transcend the Great Darkness**,\nEntering early the **Daoist Source**,\nAnd forever departing the **Underworld Exile**.\n\nThus, I dare to **return and depend upon the Supreme Dao/Way**,\nTo **establish this Ritual Feast**,\nUsing the **pure and refined** **Crane Robes**,\nAnd **knocking at the towering** **Tiger Gate**.\n\nThe **wind carries the pure chants**, enveloping the **dragging clouds and flags**.\nThe **dew embraces the fragrant incense**, shining upon the **lantern-lit jade mats**.\n\nWe **store our spirits in the heavens**, maintaining **serene simplicity** at the **midnight altar**.\nWe **report our original woes**, hoping to **reach the lofty discernment** of the **Heavenly Lords**.\n\n「Thus, the **Sacred Officials** of the **Daoist Canon** have been summoned,\nAnd the **Minister’s duty** is to **ascend and report** their words.\nThe **ritual supplications** are now humbly presented for **propagation**.\n\n**Supplication Declared.**\nIn truth, I deeply **revere and cherish** the **Heavenly Lords’ teachings**.\nI pray that my **sins may be cleansed by the Celestial Hearers**,\nAnd that **mercy may descend upon the souls in the Underworld Path**.\n\nMay the **Great Compassion** be **widely bestowed** like **sweat of benevolence**,\nAnd the **Broad Way** be **established** as a **crossing for all beings**.\n\n**Reflecting upon my own past transgressions**—\nFrom countless **kalpas (eons)** since my **first embodiment**,\nUntil this very **lifetime in the mortal world**,\nThe **sins I have committed** are **deeply rooted**:\nBy the **Six Senses**, I have been **tainted and burdened**;\nThrough the **Three Karmas (body, speech, mind)**, I have been **entangled and dragged**.\n\nThese are **inversions of right conduct**, where **good deeds fail to offset wrongdoing**.\nSometimes, I **misinterpreted the scriptures** or **transgressed the clear teachings** of the **Dao/Way**,\nOr **blamed the dharma and faulted the masters**, thus **offending the Heavenly Constitution**,\nAnd **violated the true Daoist precepts** and **Three Elements’ sacred texts**,\nSo that my **body was consigned to the Underworld Gate**,\nAnd I **suffered retribution** beyond measure—\n**Boundless sins and offenses**, too numerous to recount.\n\nNow, I **return in submission** to the **Heavenly Lords**,\nAnd **offer my lamentations** to the **Sages above**.\nFor every **fault, great or small**, I **humbly beg for absolution**.\n\nMay **lost souls be redeemed** from **suffering in the Underworld**,\nAnd **embodied spirits** **break free from torment**.\nMay the **Divine Elixir** **purify my spirit** in the **Hall of Transformation**,\nAnd my **body attain Daoist transcendence**, nourished by **consuming clouds and breathing dews**,\nAs I **unceasingly cultivate**, **accumulate learning**, and **achieve true realization**,\nGradually **ascending to the Void** without **falling into rebirth**,\nMy **form dispersing like mist**, yet my **spirit ever-present**—\n**Unbounded in existence, yet boundless in departure**,\nIn **harmony with the true Dao/Way**, my **essence aligning with the Mysterious Principle**.\n\nThe **Three Teachers and Primordial Ancestors** shall **transcend and verify** my **Daoist rank**,\nAnd the **Nine Generations of departed forebears** shall **rise upon the Celestial Path**.\n\nMay **all sentient beings** be **freed from the suffering of the Three Realms of Torment**,\nAnd **all souls** **cross the Six Realms of Existence** with **purity**,\nAs **four types of rebirth** are **equally benefited**.\n\nThe **Minister and all assembled** dare not **cease in their utmost sincerity** of **seeking truth and redeeming the departed**,\nAnd **offering this humble supplication**.\n**Scatter the flowers.**\n\n**Reaffirming the sacred ranks**—\nThe **Minister and all officers** of the **ritual assembly**,\nWith **deep reverence and sincerity**, now **prostrate and address**:\nThe **Three Pure Ones**, the **Sages above**, and the **Ten Directions of Marvelous Existence**,\nAll **responsive to the ritual**, and the **true spirits of the Dao/Way**.\n\nThough **my traces are extinguished** and **my life has ended**—\nEven if **human fate** has **its natural conclusion**,\nYet **my body remains untransformed** due to **unfulfilled Daoist merits**.\n\nI **entrust my essence to the Great Darkness**,\nAnd **send my heart to the boundless Underworld**.\nI **hear of the Supreme Dao/Way’s teachings**,\nThat there are **methods to refine and transform the mortal body**,\nAnd **sacred talismans** for **ascending to Heaven** as a **Daoist Immortal**.\n\nThus, my **form and spirit may return to the Celestial Path**,\nAnd my **body not be confined to the Underworld**.\n\nThe **Five Emperors guard and protect**,\nAnd the **Three Realms’ officials welcome**—\nThrough **countless kalpas**, **transmission flows freely**,\nAnd the **Daoist lineage** **passes down its teachings**.\n\nNow, I **establish this Ritual Feast** in **memory of my departed master**,\nAnd **rely on the Great Mercy** to **expiate my past sins**.\n\nI fear that my **departed master**,\nWho **embodied the Great Law** and **devotedly revered the Dao/Way**,\nMay have **his name recorded in the Daoist Register** yet **his cultivation interrupted**,\nAnd **his accumulated sins** lead to **untimely death**—\nHis **green tablets (records of merit)** may **fall into obscurity**,\nAnd the **Underworld officials** **hold his faults against him**,\nAs the **Heavenly Gate is barred** and the **Earthly Path is flooded**,\nLeaving him **lost in the Ghostly Marshes**, **suffering imprisonment and accusations**.\n\nI **humbly hope** for the **Great Pardon**,\nThat **past calamities may be washed away**,\nAnd **the Three Officials (of the Underworld)** be **commanded**,\nAs the **Five Emperors** are **invoked**,\nTo **abandon evil and embrace goodness**,\nAnd **revive the dead**, restoring their **corporeal remains**.\n\nMay **my departed master** **soar like a celestial bird**,\nAnd **wander freely in the Divine Abodes**,\nAs his **cultivation transcends the Six Desires**,\nAnd his **Dao/Way realization** **enlightens all lost souls**,\nBringing **equal benefit to ancestors and descendants**,\nAnd **enduring blessings to future generations**.\n\nThen, **this disciple** shall **reside peacefully in the Daoist Retreat**,\nAnd **attain the worldly honors of Daoist robes**,\nDriving away **malevolent spirits from tombs and dwellings**,\nAnd **warding off the envy of others**.\n\nMay the **Daoist Lamp** **continue unbroken**,\nAnd my **longevity surpass the purity of Tao Qing**,\nAs I **pursue the vision of longevity** like **Pine and Willow Immortals**.\n\nMay **all worldly attachments dissolve**,\nAnd **Daoist aspirations renew eternally**,\nWith **no selfish thoughts**, only **benevolent transformation for all beings**.\n\nThe **Minister and all assembled**,\nIn **uttermost sincerity and trepidation**,\n**Bow repeatedly with prostrations**,\nAnd **offer this humble prayer to the Sacred Procession**.\n\n**The Twelve Vows.**\n**Reignite the furnace.**»\n\n**Translation:**\n\nWith solemn reverence, I summon the incense officials, the left and right Dragon and Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit officials of the incense—\nThat they may command this humble one’s past sites of **Daoist rites and summoning of the True Ones** to spontaneously generate **golden elixir and jade-green pills**, **mushrooms and hundred-spirited herbs**, as the assembled **True Ones** gather before this incense furnace.\n\nI now pray that the **celestial children and jade maidens of the Ten Directions** may attend the **fragrant mists**, and swiftly convey this humble one’s sincere supplications to the **Most High, Boundless, and Supreme Dao**, the **August Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign**, and the **Savior of Suffering, the Azure Mystic Emperor of the Eastern Pole** before their august presence.\n\nMay the **Sacred Offerings be sent forth**, **transformed into merit**, and **returned with blessings**.\n\n---\n**The Complete Daoist Ritual Canon, Volume Seventy-Eight complete.**\n**The Complete Daoist Ritual Canon, Volume Seventy-Nine.**\n*Edited by Master Guangting Du, the Eastern Peak Rite of Rescue and Salvation, the Great Rite of Petition.*\n*Ascending the Platform—ritual procedures as prescribed.*\n\nThis humble official, **[name omitted]**, with due reverence, burns **Daoist incense, incense of virtue, and incense of Effortless Nature**, and in utmost sincerity, petitions the **Seven-Treasured Golden Palace Emperor of the Void and Nature**, the **Eastern Palace Master, the Great Savior, the Celestial Lord of the Great Pole**, the **lineage of scripture-transmitting and teaching True Ones of past and present**, the **Heavenly Emperor of Equal Virtue, the Sacred and Renowned Sovereign of Mount Tai**, the **Virtuous and Illuminating Empress**, the **Prince and Noble Consort**, the **Illustrious Spirit Lord of the Hall**, the **Soul King of Western Qi**, the **martial and civil officials beneath the peak**, all **clerks and attendants**, the **sentient beings of the Three Realms**, and all **True Spirits**—\nThat they may all **rely upon the sacred incense** and **universally receive this offering**.\n\nThis humble one, in deepest humility, reflects that though the **Boundless and Impartial** holds the power of transformation,\nYet among the living multitudes, there are still **differences in virtue and folly**.\n\n「The heavens and the earth are separated by eight ten-thousand *li*,\nYet for common mortals, this distance is difficult to comprehend;\nThe Twelve States of the realm were established by decree,\nIndeed, the ghosts and spirits govern their respective domains.\n\nTo discern good deeds from evil, this principle determines life and death.\nIf one harbors a heart of fear and reverence,\nOne should wholeheartedly resolve to submit to it.\nThough we risk offense in presenting this plea to convey our intent,\nOur sincere sentiments have already been laid bare before you.\n\nMay the Heavenly Emperor of Equal Virtue, the Sacred and Renowned Sovereign of Mount Tai,\nExtend his boundless compassion and blessings to us,\nSo that our sincerity may be recognized and our prayers granted;\nMay his divine favor descend upon us,\nAnd the spirits come without constraint to answer our call.\nWith the gathered officials under his command, like thunderous judgment,\nAnd the assembled saints descending as clouds,\nTemporarily leaving their lofty abodes,\nTo grace this humble offering of incense and solemn rites.\n\nPitying the world’s sorrowful and afflicted,\nRescuing the lost souls burdened with guilt,\nSo that they may escape from the depths of *yōuliáo* [幽牢, netherworldly prisons],\nAnd perhaps attain the shores of the Dao/Way.\n\nNow, the altar is erected and the rites begin,\nThe proper forms are set forth,\nAs we earnestly turn our gaze toward the sacred,\nAnd focus our thoughts as if the deities were present.\nWe aspire to the highest realms of the Dao/Way’s transcendence,\nAnd hope to harmonize with the solemnity of this *zhāi* [斋, fast].\n\nOur humble petitions are thus presented to the utmost.\n\n**Recitation of the Precepts:**\nThe Dao/Way prioritizes fasting above all else.\nIn ancient times, sacrifices required fasting,\nAnd fasting required adherence to precepts.\nOne first observed the precepts before fasting—\nThe so-called *\"seven-day precepts and three-day fasting\"*.\n\nTo disperse the fasting over seven days is called *precepts* [戒].\nThe *precepts* [戒] are what enable one to reverently follow the sacred standards,\nTo avoid transgressions and wrongdoings,\nTo strictly abide by the precepts and laws,\nAnd to never stray from them.\n\nTo concentrate the fasting over three days is called *fasting* [斋].\nThe *fasting* [斋] is what enables one to purify the mind and spirit,\nTo clarify thoughts and intentions,\nTo focus one’s essence,\nAnd to seek communion with the divine.\n\nThe *Zhōu Li* [周官] records the duties of the *Tàizǎi* [太宰, Grand Overseer],\nWho, when sacrificing to the Five Emperors,\nSupervised the oaths and precepts of all officials.\nTen days before the ritual, he led the attendants in divination\nTo determine the auspicious day for taking the precepts.\n\nMoreover, the *Dà Sī Kòu* [大司寇, Grand Marshal of Punishments]\nOversaw the swearing of all officials,\nAnd the precepts were observed by all clans.\n\nThe *Tàizǎi* [太宰], as the official in charge of governance,\nAdministered the precepts to emphasize their importance;\nThe *Dà Sī Kòu* [大司寇], as the official in charge of justice,\nPresided over them to underscore their severity.\n\nThe *Lǐjì* [礼记] also states in *\"Jiāo Tèshēng\"* [郊特牲]:\nOn the day of divination for the *Jiāo* [郊, sacrificial field],\nThe king stood by the marsh,\nPersonally listening to the oaths and instructions,\nAnd receiving counsel—\nThis was the essence of admonition.\n\nWithin the *Xiànmìng* [献命] gate,\nThe precepts were administered to all officials.\nAt the ancestral temple,\nThe precepts were administered to all people.\n\nThus, the ancients sought communion with the divine,\nStrict in their precepts,\nSerious in their fasting,\nAnd so the heavenly spirits descended at the *yuánqiū* [圆丘, circular mound],\nThe earthly deities emerged at the *fāngzé* [方泽, square marsh],\nAnd the ancestral ghosts were pleased at the ancestral temple.\n\nThough these were the fasts of sacrifice,\nThey were not the *fast of the heart* [心斋].\n\nIn days past, *Yán Huí* [颜回] received teachings from his master,\nAnd though he abstained from wine and meat for months,\nHis master did not yet permit him to practice the *fast of the heart* [心斋],\nFor he wished *Yán Huí* [颜回] to listen not with his ears,\nBut with his mind,\nAnd not with his mind,\nBut with his *qi* [气].\n\n*Qi* [气] is empty and receptive to all things,\nAnd only when the Dao/Way gathers in this emptiness\nDoes emptiness become the *fast of the heart* [心斋].\n\nThe *Zhōu Yì* [周易] states:\n\"The sages use this to wash their hearts,\nRetreating and concealing themselves in seclusion,\nFasting and observing precepts to manifest their divine virtue.\"\n\nThus, the worthy receive the Dao/Way from the sages,\nAnd the sages, who share divine virtue with the celestial,\nMust practice the *fast of the heart* [心斋] to attain the Dao/Way.\nTherefore, it is known that only after the ritual of sacrifice\nCan one seek the *fast of the heart* [心斋],\nAnd then the divine and the Dao/Way will be born within.\n\nLater generations of Daoists established *jiǎo* [醮, expiatory rites] and called them *fasting* [斋],\nFor though the Five Classics record the fasts of sacrifice,\nThey differ in name but share the same essence,\nAnd their purpose remains unified.\n\nNow, during this fasting at Mount Tai’s altar,\nWe invite the Nine Grades of High Worthies to descend and occupy the sacred platform,\nMay the Heavenly Emperor of Equal Virtue review our fasting merits,\nBe moved by our supplications to the Netherworldly Officials,\nAnd rescue the guilty souls.\nThe heavenly spirits will descend here,\nThe earthly deities will emerge here,\nAnd the human ghosts will be pleased here.\n\nNow, in conjunction with this fasting,\nWe recite the precepts,\nAnd all present at the altar\nFirst receive the precepts and their constraints,\nAs a lasting foundation for the Dao/Way.\nImmediately, one should regulate body and mind,\nBanish external distractions,\nAnd focus on the Supreme Truth,\nSo that our petitions may proceed unobstructed,\nAnd our prayers be answered with certainty.\n\nThe words of the Celestial Worthies,\nThe true precepts transmitted—\nToday, we present seven conditions,\nAll should accept and believe them.\n\n**First Precept:** Do not kill or harm.\nPity all sentient beings as if they were your own life.\nThose who kill will face six retributions:\n1) A short lifespan,\n2) Many illnesses,\n3) Ugly and repulsive appearance,\n4) Physical mutilation,\n5) Suffering in the *Dìyù* [地狱, hellish realms],\n6) Being reborn as one of the six domestic animals,\n   To repay others’ flesh and blood.\n\nNow, within the Dao/Way’s sacred precincts,\nOne must not kill or harm any living being before or behind the altar.\n\n**Second Precept:** Do not indulge in alcohol.\nThose who indulge in alcohol will face four offenses:\n1) Impeding the sight of the world,\n   Causing loss,\n2) Preventing the practice of good laws,\n3) Generating excessive sleep and lethargy,\n4) Bringing madness and confusion.\n\nNow, within the Dao/Way’s sacred precincts,\nOne must not indulge in alcohol or licentiousness,\nNor offend the High Worthies.\n\n**Third Precept:** Do not harbor rebellious or deceitful thoughts,\nNor speak dishonestly.\nThe offense of dishonesty brings five retributions:\n1) Being subjected to cruel punishments,\n2) The destruction of one’s family and clan,\n3) Suffering in the *Dìyù* [地狱, hellish realms],\n4) Being reborn as a tiger or wolf,\n5) Living in barren lands,\n   With no peace of mind.\n\nNow, within the Dao/Way’s sacred precincts,\nOne must always speak honestly and truthfully,\nAnd await the scrutiny of the High Worthies.\n\n**Fourth Precept:** Do not lack filial piety,\nNor disobey one’s parents.\nThe offense of unfilial piety brings five retributions:\n1) Being punished by earthly law,\n2) Being abandoned by all sentient beings,\n3) Suffering in the *Dìyù* [地狱, hellish realms],\n4) Being reborn as a crow or owl,\n   To inflict harm upon one another,\n5) Even if one regains human form,\n   To live in poverty and hardship.\n\nNow, after hearing the precepts,\nOne must always uphold a heart of filial devotion,\nAnd await the judgment of Heaven.\n\n**Fifth Precept:** Always cultivate a heart of compassion.\nIf one sees sentient beings nearing the end of their life,\nOne should perform meritorious deeds for them.\nEven insects and plants—\nOne must especially refrain from harming them.»\n\n「Cherish the elderly and pity the poor,\nExtend universal salvation to all,\nSo that today’s efforts shall not be in vain—\nMay the **Dao/Way**-hall hear and accept the precepts’ command.\n\n**Sixth Precept:** Do not defame the Three Treasures,\nNor disparage any **Dao/Way**-master or worthy,\nWhether lay or monastic,\nAll **Dao/Way**-images alike.\nThe offense of defamation brings four retributions:\n1) Ever beset by malevolent illnesses,\n2) Death and confinement in dark realms,\n3) A split and wandering tongue,\n4) Ever encountering adversaries—\n   None shall love or honor you.\nNow, having heard the precepts,\nOne must always revere the Three Treasures,\nAccumulating merit and virtuous deeds.\n\n**Seventh Precept:** Within this **Dao/Way**-hall today,\nOne must always maintain reverence,\nNever slacking in devotion.\nMust strive with diligence,\nBoth inwardly and outwardly,\nDay and night, unceasingly—\nDo not slacken, do not neglect.\nDiligence brings benefit,\nNegligence brings none.\nFor self-benefit and benefit to others,\nOne must hasten toward the True Extremes.\n\nDo the above seven precepts\nCollectively apply to those in the **Dao/Way**-hall?\nThe Celestial Worthy replies:\n\"True disciples of the Great Dao,\nWho receive the True Precepts,\nMust next make a vow:\nMay my precept-root be steadfast as Mount Kūnlún,\nMy precept-practice upright as the Jade Capital Hall,\nMy precept-light radiant as the Sun-Moon Pearl,\nWith diligent effort and progress,\nMay I find peace in the **Dao/Way**-hall,\nAttaining the True and Three Pure Ones,\nAs my original source.\nWith precepts as my guide,\nI shall not fall into heretical teachings.\n\nIn the past, there were **26,000 Dao/Way**-adepts,\nWho upheld the scriptural precepts,\nWith unwavering focus and no retreat,\nFollowing the law in their cultivation.\nIn twelve years,\nThey were recommended by the earthly officials,\nTheir names petitioned by the heavenly hosts.\nIn a hundred years,\nThey ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nAgain, there were **72,000 women**,\nWho did not uphold scriptural precepts,\nBut instead engaged in destruction and defamation,\nSuffering in this world and dying into the Nine Abysses.\nThus it is known:\nThe merit of upholding precepts is inconceivable.\nBreaking precepts and evil deeds are hard to absolve.\nEspecially in this **Dao/Way**-hall today,\nDevoted to redeeming past transgressions,\nCleansing faults,\nRescuing the departed,\nAnd observing precepts in fasting—\nOne must especially strive with diligence.\nAll heavenly hosts, celestial children,\nGolden **Dharmakāya**-bodies and **Vajra**-gods,\nThe Three Realms’ Five Emperors,\nDivine and immortal armies,\nAll come to guard and attend.\n\nMoreover, within Mount Tài,\nThere are the Three Palaces of the Empty Void Heaven.\nDivine chambers and halls of **Āhā**,\nGolden beds and jade tables—\nAll are gatherings of the celestial hosts.\nIf one strictly adheres to the precepts above,\nThen the Eastern Peak **Dìyù** [地狱, hellish] officials,\nThe Celestial Chief of Life and Death,\nAnd the **Yòushèng Zhēnjūn** [佑圣真君, Venerable Lord Who Assists the Sacred],\nWith the myriad enlightened worthies,\nDescend to the **Dao/Way**-hall,\nTo record the merit of fasting,\nAnd pardon the guilty spirits of the departed.\nIf one instead indulges in arrogance and disrespect,\nBreaks the fast or violates the precepts,\nIt shall not suffice to redeem the departed—\nRather, one shall be punished by the **Dìguān** [地官, earthly officials],\nAnd suffer the torment of the **Fēngdāo** [风刀, wind-blade].\nAll those gathered in this hall,\nExamine and act accordingly.\n\nYour servants are deeply moved,\nAnd humbly submit this report to hear Your decree.»\n\nThe **Dao/Way**-Gate Ritual Codes Complete Volume Seventy-Nine ends.\nThe **Dao/Way**-Gate Ritual Codes Complete

[虚无自然金阙七宝上帝, Void-Natural Jade-Gated Seven-Treasured Emperor],\nThe **Dōnggōng jiàozhǔ Tàiyǐ jiùkǔ Tiānzūn** [东宫教主太乙救苦天尊, Eastern Palace Teaching Sovereign, Great Unity Saving the Suffering Heavenly Worthy],\nThe **Chuánjīng yǎnjiào lìdài shīzhēn** [传经演教历代师真, Lineage Masters Who Transmit Scriptures and Explain Teachings Across Generations],\nThe **Dōngyuè Tàishān Tiānqí Rénshèng Dì** [东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝, Eastern Peak Great Mountain Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Sacred Emperor],\nThe **Shúmíng huánghòu** [淑明皇后, Virtuous and Illuminating Empress],\nThe **Tàizǐ guìfēi** [太子贵妃, Noble Prince and Noble Consort],\nThe **Diànshàng bǐnglíng gōng** [殿上炳灵公, Palace Hall Illustrious Spirit Lord],\nThe **Xīqí língwáng** [西齐灵王, Western Equal Spirit King],\nThe **Yuèxià wénwǔ kǎoxiào** [岳下文武考校, Civil and Martial Officials Beneath the Peak],\nAll **Yīqiè cáoliáo** [一切曹僚, All Officials],\nThe **Sānjiè yìnggǎn** [三界应感, Three Realms Responding to Sentiments],\nAnd **Yīqiè zhēnlíng** [一切真灵, All True Spirits].\n\nAll earnestly hope for Your boundless compassion,\nAnd Your benevolent gaze to descend upon us.\n\nWe have heard:\nWhen the Seven Orifices are drilled, **Húndùn** [混沌, Chaos] dies and all beings contend;\nWhen the Five **Qí** [綦, Limits] are reached, **Yínpì** [淫僻, Licentiousness] arises and chaos ensues without governance.\n\nIn the midst of such abundance and multitude,\nWho shall rule and who shall prevail?\n\nThe **Rénjūn** [人君, Human Sovereign] serves the **Tiāndào** [天道, Heavenly Dao] to establish the realm,\nAnd must delegate authority to the **Mùbó fān bǐng** [牧伯藩屏, Regional Governors and Protective Ministers];\nThe **Shàngdì** [上帝, Supreme Emperor] grasps the **Huàquán** [化权, Transformative Authority] to govern all things,\nAnd truly entrusts the **Yuèdú shénqí** [岳渎神祇, Mountain and Altar Deities] with this duty.\n\nThus, the **Zhěngshén chénshì** [主圣臣贤, Sovereign of Saints and Minister of Worthies]\nHolds authority over rewards and punishments to govern their lives;\nThe **Tiāndì shénqí** [天地神祇, Heavenly and Earthly Deities]\nRecord merit and determine their deaths.\n\nThe ritual is set forth for the **Jīshàn jī'è** [积善积恶, Accumulation of Good and Evil],\nSo that none may escape the **Yīshēng yīsǐ** [一生一死, Cycle of Life and Death].\n\nThe **Míng** [明, Bright] has its basis in human judgment,\nThe **Yōu** [幽, Dark] must suffer the **Guǐzé** [鬼责, Ghostly Retribution].\n\nThus, those who conceal their faults and adorn their vices,\nShall not escape the **Guānxíng** [邦刑, Realm’s Punishments];\nThose who harbor deceit and conceal wickedness,\nShall surely receive the **Tiānfá** [天罚, Heavenly Punishments].\n\nEven those who are first to be punished for their transgressions,\nAre also contained within the **Guófǎ** [国法, National Law];\nThose who plead for mercy and beg for compassion,\nMust surely be explained by the **Míngsī** [冥司, Netherworld Officials].\n\nHence, there is the **Chóngzhēn** [崇真, Venerating the True] **Dàojiào** [大醮, Grand Ritual],\nTruly exerting **Qínhuǐ** [勤悔, Sincere Repentance] for past transgressions.\nWe kneel and reverently address the Four Quarters,\nAnd turn our hearts to the **Yuèdì** [岳帝, Peak Emperor].\nWe pray to entrust our supplications to Your benevolent discernment,\nAnd open the gates of pardon and forgiveness.\nExamine our humble pleas in this moment,\nAnd rescue the **Zuihún** [罪魂, Guilty Spirits] from eternal night.\n\nOur supplications are divinely inspired,\nAnd presented before the **Zhìzhēn Wújí Dào** [至真无极道, Supreme True Boundless Dao].\n\n**Repentance and Supplication, Threefold Declarations, Threefold Homages.**\n\nWe humbly and devoutly present this supplication to:\nThe **Xūwú zìrán Jīnquè qībǎo Dìshàng** [虚无自然金阙七宝上帝, Void-Natural Jade-Gated Seven-Treasured Emperor],\nThe **Dōnggōng jiàozhǔ Tàiyǐ jiùkǔ Tiānzūn** [东宫教主太乙救苦天尊, Eastern Palace Teaching Sovereign, Great Unity Saving the Suffering Heavenly Worthy],\nThe **Chuánjīng yǎnjiào lìdài shīzhēn** [传经演教历代师真, Lineage Masters Who Transmit Scriptures and Explain Teachings Across Generations],\nThe **Dōngyuè Tàishān Tiānqí Rénshèng Dì** [东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝, Eastern Peak Great Mountain Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Sacred Emperor],\nThe **Shúmíng huánghòu** [淑明皇后, Virtuous and Illuminating Empress],\nThe **Yuèxià wénwǔ kǎoxiào** [岳下文武考校, Civil and Martial Officials Beneath the Peak],\nAll **Yīqiè cáoliáo** [一切曹僚, All Officials],\nThe **Sānjiè yìnggǎn** [三界应感, Three Realms Responding to Sentiments],\nAnd **Yīqiè zhēnlíng** [一切真灵, All True Spirits].\n\nWith sincere devotion, I humbly appeal to Your boundless compassion and pray for Your radiant illumination of my earnest plea.\n\nI have heard that the wood element thrives in the East, truly the domain where souls are enshrined;\nThat the mountain overlooks the State of Lu, especially revered for its rites of veneration.\nCrowned among the Five Peaks as the sole exalted one,\nEncompassing all spirits as the most noble.\n\nExamining the records of ancient intent, its name is held in greater esteem than that of the Heavenly Son;\nFollowing the customs of the age, its scriptures are preserved in the Golden Repository.\nLife’s allotted span, whether long or short, is verified by the auspicious omen of the Martial Emperor’s inspection of the ledgers;\nThe registers of duties, as seen when the Green-Browed Officials arrive with their records.\n\nFor indeed, the origins of life and its end are all governed by the Mountain Spirit’s decree.\nFrom beginning to end, it both bestows life and presides over death.\nThe Twenty-Four Prisons eternally bind malevolence and weave deceit;\nThe Eighty-Six Offices meticulously record merit and transcribe faults.\n\nThus, with unwavering devotion, I reflect upon the departed souls of the past.\nConsidering the perils of mortal existence, one may incur the sins of countless rebirths.\nOnce confined within the **Yòuláo** [狴牢], escape from imprisonment is difficult;\nFrequently subjected to cruel beatings, the suffering is unbearable.\n\nTherefore, I earnestly seek Your mercy for expiation,\nAnd with utmost reverence, offer prayers in supplication.\n\nThe ministers, at the outset of our rites and the very beginning of the altar’s establishment,\nnow follow the Celestial Worthy’s decree and reverently proclaim the Sincere Words of the Ritual Master.\nWe solemnly present the Altar’s Invocation.\n\n**Proclamation of Words:**\nCarefully examining each phrase, their depth is filled with profound sorrow.\nFor we lament the dead and mourn the departed,\nlaying bare our hearts and pouring forth our souls.\nDeeply concerned that accumulated sins may bind the soul to the Underworld,\nor that unclear records may bring disgrace at the hands of prison guards,\nwe humbly present our plea and pray for mercy and compassion.\n\nWe seek to purge transgressions—\nspared from ignorance and unawareness,\nyet granted the sincerity of the common and devout,\nknowing their reverence and filial piety.\n\nAs the wind-steeds and cloud-chariots descend upon the fasting altar,\nand the rainbow banners and crimson flags welcome the celestial procession,\nwe gaze upward to True Compassion,\nand below, we seek to bestow hidden blessings.\n\nThe ministers, with utmost sincerity, now establish this pure space\nand initiate the grand rites.\nWe humbly beseech the Supreme Three Sovereigns and the Ten Directions’ Holy Assembly\nto descend in spirit, inspect, and discern our sincere devotion.\n\nWe pray that the Celestial Officials of this land and domain be commanded\nto unite in harmony, exert their strength in defense,\ncleanse both within and without, purify the altar grounds,\nsubdue demons and quash malevolent spirits,\nso that we may find peace of mind and spirit,\nour devotions instantly fulfilled,\nour petitions ascending without obstruction,\nand our virtuous deeds completed as desired.\n\nNow, in accordance with the ritual stages, we proceed step by step.\n**Twelve Vows.**\n\n**Reigniting the Incense Furnace:**\nWe solemnly command the Incense Officials, the Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,\nand the Attendant Spirit Officials—\nthat at the very place where I have previously conducted nocturnal rites,\ngolden elixirs and emerald jade, mushrooms and sacred herbs,\nand all the numinous spirits shall naturally gather.\nMay the Ten Directions’ Celestial Youth and Jade Maidens attend to the incense smoke,\ntransmitting my sincere invocations directly to the Supreme, Boundless, and Ultimate Dao,\nbefore the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign’s Celestial Court.\n\n**Exiting the Hall to Chant Praises.**\n**Exiting the Door.**\n\n**Daoist Rituals Comprehensive Canon, Volume Eighty-First: The Great Ritual of the Eastern Peak (Jizhu) for Salvation and Petition**\n\n**Morning Rites:**\nAt dawn, the ritual stages proceed as prescribed.\nThe ritual platform is ascended according to form.\nEach pays homage to the Master in accordance with the Daoist rites.\n\n**Proclaiming Sacred Incantations for Protection:**\nThe Azure Yang (青阳) casts its radiant light,\nIlluminating the sun’s return to life.\nThe Spirit Tiger wards off malevolence,\nThe Flying Heavens toll their celestial bells.\nThe wicked are crushed, the evil destroyed,\nTen thousand demons bound in form.\nThe Nine Mysteries (九微) circulate the Dao,\nThe Eight Powers (八威) subdue the spirits.\nA thousand numinous beings (千真) register their presence,\nThe Three Realms (三元) dispel impurities.\n\nLeft, the Yellow Dragon is summoned,\nRight, the Six Celestial Officials (六丁) are invoked.\nSeven revolutions, eight harmonizations,\nOrbiting the Heavenly Scriptures.\nThe sacred aura stands majestic,\nThe Dao begins its course.\nAuspicious clouds flow forth,\nThe gathered brilliance of the Yellow Court (黄庭) aligns with the Dao,\nAs the true and the Dao merge.\n\nThe Sacred Law Drum (法鼓) is struck twenty-four times.\n\n**Reigniting the Incense Furnace:**\nWe summon the Supreme Three Heavens, the Primordial Origin of the Three *Qi* (三炁),\nThe Most High Dao Lord (道君), and the Most High Lao Lord (老君),\nTo bring forth from my body the **Thirty-Five Celestial Officials** (三五功曹),\nLeft and Right Officials and Messengers (左右官使者),\nLeft and Right Bearers of Incense (左右捧香),\nThe Postal Dragons and Mounted Envoys (驿龙骑吏),\nThe Golden Youth Attendants (侍香金童),\nThe Jade Maidens who transmit words and scatter flowers (传言散花玉女),\nThe Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols (五帝直符),\nThe Incense Officials of the Direct Sun (直日香官),\nAnd all **Thirty-Six Persons** (三十六人) to emerge.\n\nThose who emerge are clad in solemn, resplendent robes,\nWith caps and sashes trailing their ceremonial plumes.\nThe Land and Spirit Officials of the Mystic Platform (玄坛) are opened,\nAnd the regional deities and numinous spirits are invoked.\n\nNow, at this dawn ritual,\nI humbly present my intentions.\nMy sincerity is profound,\nAlready recorded and heard by the Celestial.\nI pray that the Most High Dao *Qi* (十方至真道炁) of the Ten Directions,\nThe Sacred Treasure of Auspicious Light (灵宝瑞光),\nDescend and flow into my body,\nSo that my invocations may swiftly reach\nThe Most High, Boundless Dao (无极大道),\nAnd the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign’s Golden Gate (金阙玉皇上帝御前).\n\n**Requesting the Invocation of the Sacred Law Position:**\nThe assembled petitioners of the **Sacred Law Position** (法位),\nWith utmost reverence and sincerity,\nBeseech the **Supreme, Natural, Golden Gate, Seven Treasures Emperor** (虚无自然金阙七宝上帝),\nThe Eastern Palace’s **Great Unity Teacher, the Most High Saviour of Suffering** (教主太乙救苦天尊),\nThe lineage of Masters who transmit the scriptures and expound the teachings (传经演教历代师真),\nThe **Eastern Peak, Tai Mountain, Celestial Harmony and Benevolence Emperor** (东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝),\nThe **Virtuous and Auspicious Empress** (淑明皇后),\nThe **Noble Prince and Consort** (太子贵妃),\nThe **Illustrious Spirit Official of the Hall** (殿上炳灵公),\nThe **Spirit King of Western Harmony** (西齐灵王),\nThe **Literary and Martial Examiners beneath the Peak** (岳下文武考校),\nAll Celestial Officials (一切曹僚),\nThe Three Realms’ responsive spirits (三界应感),\nAnd all numinous beings (一切真灵).\n\nAll look upon the boundless mercy,\nAnd descend to manifest the sacred compassion.\nWe hear that within the **Five Celestial Officials** (五明官),\nThe Celestial Sovereign pities those in the cycle of rebirth;\nAnd in the **Eastern Extremity Officials** (东极官),\nThe Great Unity (太乙) always rescues those in suffering.\n\nIndeed, for the ignorant masses,\nThey do not know the noble ones of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd drift like boats in the boundless sea of desire,\nDrowning in the river of attachment.\nTheir sins have already accumulated,\nTheir karmic bonds are difficult to escape,\nBecause of their greed for life, they lose life,\nAnd because of their pursuit of suffering, they obtain suffering.\nOnce they depart this world,\nThey long strike the **Yin Court** (阴司).\nThus, the Most High opens the **Gate of Salvation** (济度之门),\nAnd only those of true virtue (真格) may be recommended for elevation,\nAllowed to return with sincerity and repent their sins,\nAnd attain liberation from judgment to ascend.\n\nWhile worldly entanglements remain,\nThey cannot escape the **Six Roots of Impurity** (根尘之六);\nBut the **Broad Reach of the Sacred Law** (冲科广被)\nWill surely hear the **Three Declarations of Pardon** (赦宥之三).\nHow could they not take pity on the foolish?\nAnd yet, they may still deeply harbor those who repent.\n\nThe humble petitioners of the Dao,\nWith sorrow and suffering as our offerings,\nAnd blood shed in sincerity,\nLament the swift passage of time,\nAnd reflect deeply on the suffering of the **Netherworld** (幽圄).\nWe look to the **Peak’s Celestial Court** (岳府),\nWhich truly receives the lost souls of the departed;\nAnd with reverence, we set up the **fasting altar** (斋坛),\nHoping to move the Emperor’s intentions.\n\nHaving prepared our words and intent,\nWe dare not fail to present them.\n\n**Proclaiming the Words:**\nAs the words are spoken,\nThe deep lament and pity are manifest.\nIndeed, the rites for the departed are called **Great Matters** (大事),\nAnd those who face mourning must double their sorrow.\nThough the departed cannot be recalled,\nAnd the **Elixir of the Night** (夜丹) cannot be retained;\nYet the living truly hold sorrow and gratitude,\nAnd the sincerity of the fasting rites extends.\n\nDeeply contemplating the **Netherworld’s Judges** (管摄之冥司),\nWho are indeed the **lofty Eastern Peak** (崇高之岱岳),\nWe fear that the souls may still be bound in **affliction** (缧绁),\nAnd thus, we must **widely establish the means of salvation** (津梁).\n\nWith utmost sincerity and devotion,\nWe pray for purification and transcendence.\nOn this pure dawn,\nWe perform the **Celestial Assembly Rites** (朝元行道),\nAnd request the **Law Assembly** (法众) to light the first incense strand.\nMay this fragrant smoke ascend straight to the heavens,\nTo offer homage to the **Jade Purity Supreme Venerable** (玉清圣境元始天尊),\nAnd the **Ten Directions’ Dao Treasures** (十方道宝).\n\nWe, the subjects, **surrender body, spirit, and fate** (皈身、皈神、皈命),\nAnd dedicate these merits to bless our present Emperor.\nThus, under the **Emperor’s virtuous reign** (尧日),\nThe eight directions equally bask in his radiance;\nAnd the **harmonious winds of Shun’s era** (舜风) bring prosperity to all beings.\nWeapons rest without conflict, prisons stand empty without punishment,\nFor **virtue’s power** (德) is vast in cherishing life,\nAnd the realm attains **Ren’s eternal longevity** (仁寿).\n\nThe **Yellow Banner** advances southward,\nWith auspicious qi eternally descending upon **Fighter and Ox** (斗牛);\nThe **Green Sea** returns westward,\nWhere no wails disturb the **war spirits** (战鬼).\n\nThe **Five Auspicious Blessings** (五福) are bestowed upon the virtuous people,\nAnd the **Great Peace** (泰治) endures for ten thousand years,\nPreserving the boundless **imperial mandate** (无疆之历).\n\nNow, we burn incense in devotion,\nAnd **take refuge in the Supreme Sage’s most authentic virtue** (至真之德).\nAfter attaining the Dao,\nWe ascend to **Non-Action** (无为),\nAnd harmonize with the **True Dao** (道合真).\n\nAs it is said:\nThe **Pearl Mouth Gathering** (珠口) gathers the True,\nAnd aligns the **halted light of sun and moon** (停景);\nThe **Cavernous Chapter** (洞章) emits a call,\nAnd the mountains and rivers swallow the mist.\n\nThrough the **resonant clouds** (流响之云营),\nThe wandering celestial sages (游空之仙圣) are moved.\n\nOn this pure dawn,\nWe perform the **Celestial Assembly Rites** (朝元行道),\nAnd request the

**Supreme Scripture Treasures** (无上经宝).\n\nWe, the subjects, **surrender body, spirit, and fate** (皈身、皈神、皈命),\nAnd dedicate these merits to the **Ritual Master** (醮主) and his household,\nTo the **Yearly Star Deity** (太岁尊神) presiding over this dwelling,\nAnd to the **tabooed branches and stems** (支干禁忌),\nThe **door and gate officials** (门丞户尉),\nThe **monthly and daily calamities** (月煞日游),\nSo as to avert misfortune and offense,\nAnd invite the blessings of peaceful abode,\nFree from fear and resentment,\nEach coming with reverence and delight,\nTheir thoughts pure and their words auspicious,\nListening to the **introduction of blessings** (介福).\n\nNow, we burn incense in devotion,\nAnd **take refuge in the Scripture Sage’s most authentic virtue** (至真之德).\nAfter attaining the Dao,\nWe ascend to the **Formless** (无形),\nAnd harmonize with the **True Dao** (道合真).\n\nAs it is said:\nReciting the **Nine-Heaven Scripture Treasures** (九天之宝章),\nOne attains the **Three Officials’ records** (三官之考算);\nStudying the **Three Caverns’ doctrines** (三洞之科典),\nOne earns the protection of the **Hundred Spirits** (百灵之护持).\nIf one follows the **Great Pattern’s grandeur** (大范之巍巍),\nOne shall surely receive the **distant blessings** (遐福之简简).\n\nOn this pure dawn,\nWe perform the **Celestial Assembly Rites** (朝元行道),\nAnd request the **Law Assembly** (法众) to light the third incense

rank** (青紫);\nThose who till the fields and labor at harvest (服田力穑) accumulate wealth in their granaries (倉箱).\n\nThe **rites of virtue and merit** (式彰善积) honor households where good deeds abound,\nAnd such families need not fear **spectral scrutiny** (鬼瞰) of their halls.\n\nNow, as we burn the incense,\nWe **surrender ourselves** (皈依) to the **Ritual Master’s Venerable Great Saints** (師尊大聖), seeking the **Perfect Virtue** (至真之德).\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way** (得道), we rise into the **formless** (升入無形),\nAnd harmonize with the **Dao/Way’s True Essence** (和與道合真).\n\n**Repentance and homage** (忏方) are offered—three invocations, three rites.\nWe, the **humble subjects of various ranks** (具位臣某等),\nWith **sincere devotion** (同誠上啟), now address:\nThe **Natural Void’s Golden Gate,

and damp** (履霜濡露) will **always bear remembrance of the past** (必懷追往之心).\n\nWith **books filling the forests** (書籍滿林), one may **trace their former deeds by hand** (驗手容而可想);\nWith **ink and paper on

not be absolved** (愆尤難免);\nLest they linger in the **realms of confinement** (拘囚之地),\nWith **no means of liberation** (解脱無由).\n\nWith **all our mortal sincerity** (用罄凡誠),\nWe **pray for benevolent pardon** (仰祈善貸),\nTo **cleanse their sins from the black register** (洗罪名於黑簿),\nAnd **refine their mortal essence into the yellow flower** (煉生質於黃華),\nSwiftly passing the **underworld gates** (速出泉關),\nAnd **early ascending to the Dao’s shore** (早登道岸).\n\nAbove, we **acknowledge the Celestial Master’s vast mercy** (上明天尊大慈之澤),\nBelow, we **fulfill our subjects’ surrender of fate**

三界应感),\n**All True Spirits** (一切真灵).\n\n**May all behold the boundless compassion** (咸望洪慈),\n**And graciously descend to fulfill our earnest prayers** (俯垂丹恳).\n\n**My understanding:**\nThe **Trigram Zhèn governs the Great Way** (处震卦而为大涂), **rightfully ranking first among all things.**\n**Ascending Mount Tai, one surveys the world** (登泰山而小天下), **ever presiding over the foremost of all sacrifices.**\nThe **East is the origin of life** (东乃始生之方), **Tai the pivot of cosmic governance** (岱为管摄之地).\n**Life begins facing east** (生必东首), **as ancient wisdom knew the proper orientation.**\n**Qi arises from the eastern horizon** (气起东隅), **manifesting the Creator’s benevolent and nurturing intent** (造物全温厚之致).\nThus, **the Peak Emperor’s Virtue** (岳帝之德) **truly aligns with

ascent of mortal sincerity** (顾凡情之上达).\n**May boundless blessings be bestowed** (大颁善利), **and the departed swiftly guided** (速度亡魂).\n**With these words of noon, my heartfelt plea is now proclaimed** (临午词诚, 谨当宣奏).\n\n**Proclamation of the Words:**\n**As the text declares, the sorrow is profound and unbearable** (按如词旨, 深切悲\n\nWith today’s midday Dao practice, we humbly request the assembled Daoists to light this first incense strand, praying that its fragrant smoke may ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the **Yuqing** [玉清] Holy Realm’s **Yuanshi Tianzun** [元始天尊], the Dao treasures of the Ten Directions.\n\nWe, the petitioners, **surrender our bodies, surrender our spirits, surrender our lives**, dedicating these merits to the departed soul of **[Name]**. May this merit cleanse the sins of countless past lives and earn the boundless grace of the **Sìqīng** [四清] [1].\n\nWith heartfelt sincerity, we silently move the **Emperor’s** [帝] heart to compassion; our prayers reach the heavens, beseeching mercy from above.\n\nKnowing their past folly, we now implore this moment’s repentance—commanding the prison guards to release their chains, entrusting the **Sìmìng** [司命] to preserve their form. May they swiftly depart the path of darkness and attain the realm of **xiāoyáo** [逍遥].\n\nThus, we now burn this incense, **taking refuge in the Dao’s Great Saints’ supreme virtue**. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True and the Way.\n\nAs the teachings of **Yuanshi** declare, all are boundless in their salvation of beings.\n\n---\n[1] *Sìqīng* (四清): A Daoist triad of deities associated with purity and liberation (often linked to the **Yuqing** realm’s highest echelons). Retained here for conventional religious context.\n\nAt this moment, when the sun is at its zenith, we perform the Dao/Way’s rites, and humbly request that the assembled **Sìqīng** [四清] bear this two-pinched incense aloft. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the **Shàngqīng** [上清] True Realm’s **Língbǎo Tiānzūn** [灵宝天尊], the peerless **jīngbǎo** [经宝].\n\nWe now dedicate our bodies, our spirits, and our lives—may this merit return to our departed ancestors and wayward souls. We earnestly pray for the erasure of their sinful records, the cessation of their **yīnsī** [阴司] reckonings, the extinguishing of their evil roots, and liberation from the suffering of their past lives. May they escape the **Shānhuǒ** [山火] prison’s unyielding bonds and be granted the mercy of the **Leiyǔ** [雷雨] deliverance.\n\nTheir transgressions of body, speech, and mind shall be cleansed; the **shénqí guǐ** [神祇鬼] who ensnare them shall be commanded to yield to the **Hánhóng** [涵洪] grace. May they meet the hour of resurrection, receive the transformation of rebirth, and follow the path of the lost to their wandering’s end, while witnessing our heartfelt sincerity.\n\nNow we burn this incense, **taking refuge in the Dao’s Great Saints’ supreme virtue**. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True and the Way.\n\nWe have heard: with the **yuán guī** [圆规] in hand, the **Tàihào** [太皞] presides over the square of the **Fāngzhě** [司方] realm; without waiting for dawn, the **Gōngyáng** [公羊] records the **Chùshí** [触石] merit. Indeed, the sacred peaks’ spirits strive to bestow blessings upon all mortals.\n\nAt this moment, when the sun is at its zenith, we perform the Dao/Way’s rites, and humbly request that the assembled **Sìqīng** [四清] bear this three-pinched incense aloft. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the **Tàiqīng** [太清] Celestial Realm’s **Jiàngshēng Tiānzūn** [降生天尊], the Ten Directions’ **Shībǎo** [师宝].\n\nWe now dedicate our bodies, our spirits, and our lives—may this merit return to our departed ancestors and wayward souls. We earnestly pray for the **Àihé** [爱河]’s stilling waves and the **Kǔhǎi** [苦海]’s ceasing tides; that they, once deceived and unaware, now hear and instantly awaken.\n\nThe sacred peaks’ spirits descend their grace—may their souls soar free in the boundless void. The **Kōngdòng** [空洞] gives birth to spirits, merging their **Zhuī** [炁] essence with the **Fànfǔ** [梵辅] realm. Ever freed from the depths of suffering, swiftly granted the mercy of **Liàndù** [炼度].\n\nNow we burn this incense, **taking refuge in the Dao’s Great Saints’ supreme virtue**. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True and the Way.\n\n**Chànyuán** [忏方], three invocations, three obeisances.\n\nYour humble servants of the **Jùwèi** [具位] ranks, with utmost sincerity, now prostrate ourselves before the **Xūwú Zìrán Jīnquè Qībǎo Shàngdì** [虚无自然金阙七宝上帝], the **Dōnggōng Jiàozhǔ Tàiyǎ Jiùkǔ Tiānzūn** [东宫教主太乙救苦天尊], the **Chuánjīng Yǎnjiào Lìdài Shīzhēn** [传经演教历代师真], the **Dōngyuè Tàishān Tiānqí Rénshèng Dì** [东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝], the **Shúmíng Huánghòu** [淑明皇后], the **Tàizǐ Guìfēi** [太子贵妃], the **Diànshàng Bǐnglíng Gōng** [殿上炳灵公], the **Xīqí Língwáng** [西齐灵王], the **Yuèxià Wénwǔ Kǎoxiào** [岳下文武考校], all **Yīqiè Cáoliáo** [一切曹僚], the **Sānjiè Yìnggǎn** [三界应感], and all **Yīqiè Zhēnlíng** [一切真灵].\n\nMay they all behold the vast mercy and descend to illuminate our humble supplications.\n\nWe have heard: when the **Wèitóng** [会同] gathers the Five Elders, the **Tiānzūn** [天尊] always listens to the Law; when the **Guāngzhào Jiǔyōu** [光照九幽] shines upon the Nine Depths, the **Fǎjiě** [法解] arises through prayerful invocation.\n\nDeeply moved by the suffering of the **Sāntú** [三涂], we are especially grieved by the hardships of the **Wǔkǔ** [五苦]. To examine and punish the guilty spirits, there are the **Jùtiān Lìshì** [巨天力士]; to enforce the strict laws of the **Yīnyù** [阴狱], there are the **Zhífǎ Shénbīng** [执法神兵].\n\nThe **Jiànshù Dāoshān** [剑树刀山] sever sinews and shatter bones; the **Liàngtāng Lúitàn** [镬汤炉炭] reduce flesh to ash. The **Niǎozhuó Shéyīn** [鸟啄蛇吞] and the **Lígēng Jùjiě** [犁耕锯解] bring torment beyond measure. Such suffering is truly lamentable.\n\nFortunately, the **Shàngshèng** [上圣]’s boundless compassion teaches the causes of their plight; the **Zhēnrén** [真人]’s pity allows them to know the path of virtuous conduct.\n\nThough bound by the **Sānyè** [三业] and stained by the **Liùchén** [六尘], they follow their desires, unaware that the **Shíhuǒ** [石火] moment cannot be halted. In receiving retribution and calamity, they only prolong the **Yèfēi** [夜扉]’s endless closure.\n\nYet even now, they may reform their hearts and turn toward the Dao, all granted deliverance from judgment and purification from sin.\n\nTo cultivate vast fields of merit, they must rely on the **Lánghán** [琅函] scriptures; to exalt the **Shènghào** [圣号], none surpass the **Dōngjí** [东极] **Tiānzūn** [天尊].\n\nTruly, this clears the roots of doubt and allows them to grasp the **Xīyí** [希夷] mysteries.\n\nYour humble servant, **Dìngguān** [醮官], in deep reflection, fears that the **Àifāng** [哀方] suffer more in death than in life, their sins accumulating even in their brief existence. The **Yèwǎng** [业网] remains unbroken, and the **Fǎqiáo** [法桥] is yet unreached. They must now depend on the **Miàoshàn** [妙善] to purge their past transgressions.\n\nThus, we solemnly prepare the **Zhāi tán** [斋坛], and with utmost reverence, perform the **Rùlǐ** [褥礼] rites.\n\nNamed **Xiānshēng** [先嵩], we ever raise our heads to gaze afar; our faces turn toward the **Yúntíng** [云亭], our hearts yearning for divine compassion.\n\nThe **Dānyú** [丹舆] and **Lǜbèi** [绿辈] await the swift arrival of the **Biāoxū** [飙忽]; the **Yǔgài** [羽盖] and **Níqíng** [霓旌] hope for the descending **Wēirúi** [葳蕤].\n\nMay they discern our sincere devotion and open wide the gates of deliverance. May the **Jiùkǔ Shàngzhēn** [救苦上真] respond in kind; may the **Zhìchuí** [坠魄] souls, once submerged, now submit and take form.\n\nSwiftly may they meet the **Nánjí** [南极]’s **Zhùshēng** [注生], and also gain the **Běidū** [北都]’s **Bùwèi** [部卫]. Gradually ascending the **Xiānlù** [仙路], they shall not stray from the path, and all shall be granted equal harmony in life and death.\n\nAbove, we honor the **Tiānzūn** [天尊]’s vast mercy; below, we fulfill our servants’ **Guīmìng** [皈命] sincerity. Thus we humbly report.\n\n**Shíèr yuàn** [十二愿]. **Fùlú** [复炉].\n\nWe now solemnly command the **Xiāngguān Shǐzhě** [香官使者], the **Zuǒyòu Lónghǔ Jūn** [左右龙虎君], and the **Shìxiāng Zhūlǐngguān** [侍香诸灵官], to bring us to the place where we once performed the Dao/Way’s rites at noon. There, **Jīnyè Dānbì** [金液丹碧] and **Zhīyīng Bǎilíng** [芝英百灵] shall naturally arise, and all **Zhōngzhēn** [众真] shall gather at this incense altar.\n\nMay the **Shífāng Xiānróng Yùnǚ** [十方仙童玉女] attend to the **Lántián** [兰烟], swiftly conveying our servants’ sincere supplications to the **Zhìxīng Wújí Dàdào** [至真无极大道] and the **Hàotiān Yùhuáng Shàngdì** [昊天玉皇上帝] before the **Yuè** [御].\n\n**Chūtáng

Emperor**,\nThe **Virtuous and Illuminating Empress**,\nThe **Crown Prince and Noble Consort**,\nThe **Splendid-Spirit Official of the Hall**,\nThe **Western Qi Spirit King**,\nThe **Literary and Martial Examiners Beneath the Peak**,\nAll officials and attendants,\nThe **Three Realms of Responsive Spirits**,\nAll **True Spirits and Sacred Beings**.\n\nMay they all behold the vast mercy and deign to reveal the crimson sincerity.\n\nWe have heard:\n*\"Sealing the golden mud\"*—this duty remains with the sovereign;\n*\"The jade scroll’s transmission\"*—this decree governs the order of humanity.\nAbove, it connects with the empty void of Heaven, thus called the **Celestial Realm of the Immortals**;\nBelow, it governs life and death, serving as the **Yin Officials’ registry**.\n\nYet we reflect upon the recently departed souls—\nTheir **black ledgers** of sins may yet remain unexpunged.\nThough crimes are not yet recorded, their severity must be weighed in lightness and depth;\nThough intentions seek severe punishment, they must be allowed room for **repentance in sorrow**.\n\nAll may thus tread the path of renewal, knowing the period of transformation.\n\nMoreover, the **Heavenly Venerable of Rescue and Life**—\nAll originate from the **Eastern Residence** to enlighten;\nEven the **Chanting Officials of Reverence and Compliance**—\nFollow the **Eastern Direction** in reciting their hymns.\n\nWe know the **Peak Emperor’s benevolence** does not reject the pleas of mortals.\n\nThe ritual officials, grieving the swift passage of life like a galloping steed—\nAlready separated from the living by the veil of death;\nFearful of the **unwholesome *qi* of the horse**, ever drawn to perilous paths—\nIn life, they violated the **Awakened Ones’ intentions**;\nIn death, they suffer boundless torment.\nFalling into Hell, they must harbor pain and regret;\nIn the human world, they should strive for **posthumous rectification**.\n\nThus may they move the **Emperor’s heart**, or even turn his **wrathful *qi**—\nThe roots of karma and the nets of sin shall dissolve like mist and ice;\nThe fruits of virtue and fields of blessing shall unfold like clouds and rain.\n\nThe **Three Primordials** nurture their essence—\nNow they hear the **Great Unity’s talisman-bearer**;\nThe **Eight Auspicious Scenes** manifest their spirits—\nAgain, they receive the **Emperor’s decree of rank**.\n\nNow, with the **midnight watch** just struck and the **first hour’s tally** announced,\nThe **bright moon** hangs high, framing the boundless sky—\nIt is fitting to **present our grievances**,\nTo offer our **sincere fasting words**,\nAnd solemnly **proclaim our petitions**.\n\n**Proclamation of Words:**\nAs the words declare, with profound pity and sorrow—\nWe have heard:\n*\"Without the Primordial Sovereign’s talismans and decrees, one cannot ascend the stages of transcendence and elevation;\nWithout the Jade Emperor’s proclamation of names, one cannot attain the realm of immortality.\"*\n\nWe must rely on the **Supreme Dao/Way** to rescue the lost souls,\nTransforming the **artificial into the natural**, the **formed into the formless**,\nFollowing the **Direct Path’s regulations** to present our petitions,\nHoping the **Celestial Chariot** may swiftly arrive,\nFurther revealing our **grief and sorrow**, and beseeching **compassionate mercy**.\n\nNow, as the evening’s light fades and the Dao/Way practice begins,\nWe request the assembled ritualists to take this **first incense offering**,\nMay this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens,\nTo offer worship to the **Pure Celestial Sacred Realm’s Primordial Sovereign** and the **Ten Directions’ Dao/Way Treasures**.\n\nWe, the servants, **take refuge in body, spirit, and life**,\nAnd dedicate these merits to the **ritual official’s household**, all kin and dependents—\nMay those who have passed receive early elevation to the **Path of the Immortals**;\nMay the living enjoy longevity and blessings, reaching **venerable old age**.\nWith **snow-white hair and furrowed brows**, they shall stand as pillars, never faltering like the **distant crane**;\nWith **hunched backs and protruding teeth**, they shall lean on their staffs, as sturdy as the **sacred tortoise**.\nThe **Yellow Register** shall erase the records of death;\nThe **Green Flower** shall inscribe the ledgers of extended years.\nThe **Heavenly Bestowal** shall grant the **rare blessing of non-aging**,\nAnd the **Great Sovereign’s lament** shall be silenced.\n\nNow, we burn this incense in **sincere devotion to the Dao/Way’s Great Saints and True Virtues**.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao/Way, one ascends to the **Formless**,\nAnd harmonizes with the **True Dao/Way**.\n\nWe have heard:\n*\"The Jade Boy Attending the Immortals\"*—\nHis divine origin first unfolded in the **embroidered brocade**;\n*\"The Great Saint of Longevity\"*—\nFirst rescued mortals from the **Eastern Quarter**.\n\nNow, as the evening’s light fades and the Dao/Way practice begins,\nWe request the assembled ritualists to take this **second incense offering**,\nMay this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens,\nTo offer worship to the **Most High Pure Realm’s Sacred Treasure Sovereign** and the **Supreme Scriptural Treasures**.\n\nWe, the servants, **take refuge in body, spirit, and life**,\nAnd dedicate these merits to the **ritual official’s two ancestral gates and seven generations of forefathers**.\n\nMay they swiftly ascend the **Golden Tablet’s path** to the **Jade Capital**,\nTranscending the **Three Realms**, and be **commended by the Demon King**.\n\nAscend in name to the **Nine Palaces**,\nAnd proceed to pay homage at the **Great Sovereign**.\n\nHasten to the **Dragon Gate** to receive the assembly,\nAnd gain the **Bird Mother’s** guidance as a **Sacred Treasure Sovereign**,\nNo longer entangled in **grave disputes**,\nNor subject to the calamities of descendants.\n\nNow, through this incense offering,\nWe **take refuge** in the **Supreme Teacher’s** **Great Saintly Assembly’s** **Most True Virtue/Power**.\nObtaining the Dao/Way thereafter,\nWe enter the **Formless Realm** and harmonize with the **True Dao/Way**.\n\nI have heard that the **Nine Refining Transformations** truly **revive the dead**,\nAnd that **Ten Directions without limit** hold no greater merit than **saving beings**.\n\nThrough tonight’s **auspicious Dao/Way practice**,\nWe request the ritual assembly to present this **third incense offering**,\nMay this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens,\nAnd worship the **Supreme Pure Sacred Treasure Sovereign of the Celestial Realm** and the **Ten-Directional Teacher Treasures**.\n\nWe, the servants, **take refuge in body, spirit, and life**,\nAnd dedicate these merits to the **five surnames of the departed**,\nMale and female lonely spirits, and the **four types of sentient beings**.\nWithered corpses and decayed bones,\nYet to leave the **land of darkness and stagnation**;\nWearing horns and bearing fur,\nNot spared from the **whips and lashes of suffering**.\n\nIn the **dim underworld**, where **demons and spirits** lurk,\nSquirming and writhing like **serpents and maggots**,\nThey lose their **vital essence** and remain utterly confused,\nClinging to **blood and qi** yet lacking awareness.\nSome starve in **hunger and thirst**,\nFalling into **ravines and ditches**;\nOthers perish in **warfare and conflict**,\nTheir bodies **rotting in grass and marshes**.\n\nCliffs and valleys, drowning in water or burning in flames,\nImprisoned in **jails and cages**,\nOr dying by the **roadside**—\nAll suffer **harsh wrongs**,\nYet none encounter the **merit of commendation and guidance**,\nWandering the **Three Paths**, cycling through the **Six Realms of Rebirth**.\n\nHumbly, we pray to **ride upon the Dao’s power**,\nAnd **rely entirely on the True Compassion**.\nTo **abandon past ignorance** and avoid **falling into error**,\nAnd to **meet tonight’s guidance**,\nThat all may swiftly **transcend and ascend**.\n\nFreeing ourselves from **demonic spirits’** clutches,\nShedding our **traces in dust and sand**,\nWe all return to birth as **human beings**,\nAnd hear the **lawful sounds** of the **Dharma**.\n\nNow, through this incense offering,\nWe **take refuge** in the **Supreme Teacher’s** **Great Saintly Assembly’s** **Most True Virtue/Power**.\nObtaining the Dao/Way thereafter,\nWe enter the **Formless Realm** and harmonize with the **True Dao/Way**.\n\n**Repentance of the Ten Directions**,\nThree invocations, three obeisances.\nThe humble servants, **[names omitted]**, sincerely and earnestly present this plea:\n\nTo the **Natural Void Supreme Golden Gate Seven-Treasured Sovereign**,\nThe **Eastern Palace Master, the Great Sovereign of the Celestial Way**,\nThe **Sutra-Transmitting and Teaching Sovereigns of Past Ages**,\nThe **Eastern Peak, Grand Imperial Sovereign of the Jade Equilibrium**,\nThe **Virtuous and Benevolent Empress**,\nThe **Crown Prince and Noble Consort**,\nThe **Illuminating Spirit Official of the Hall**,\nThe **Spirit King of the Western Equilibrium**,\nAnd all **clerks and officials** beneath the **Eastern Peak**,\nThe **Three Realms’** responsive beings,\nAnd all **True Immortals**.\n\nMay they **hear our earnest prayers** and **reveal their compassion**.\nI have heard that even those **who govern the year**,\nGranting **ascension to the mountain** to **subdue demons**,\nAnd those **who enjoy abundant food and salary**,\nYet still **record the dead’s names** as **officials of life**—\nFor the **thirty-six Formless Void Sovereigns**,\nThe **True Spirits** must surely gather;\nAnd how much more so for the **seventy-two Sovereigns of the Seal Offerings**,\nWhose rites are **especially esteemed**!\n\nThey **oversee the underworld**,\nAnd **specialize in managing calamities and blessings**.\nThough their names are **registered in the living ledgers**,\nThey must first **judge the departed spirits**.\nExamining deeds and calculating merits,\nThere is **distinction between righteousness and wrongdoing**;\nAscending names or **falling into the tablets**,\nHow could there be no **differences in fate’s speed**?\n\nIf not for **purifying the mind** to **cleanse the heart**,\nHow could **expiation of sins** and **repairing past faults** be possible?\n\nThe **ritual official’s household**,\nNow **awakening grief and sorrow**,\n**Shedding tears** and **aching in the heart**,\nWith **painted images** yet **unseen**,\nNo **gentle admonition** heard;\nThough **offerings are made**,\nThe **emotion is still deeply sorrowful**.\n\nJoy is **suddenly cut off** at the **gates of the home**,\nAnd **arrest and return** are **only now** sent to the **Eastern Peak’s office**.\n\nWithout **rites**, none can be **guided**—\nMay we **fulfill the merit of guidance**;\nWithout **rites**, none can **ascend**—\nMay we **earn the fruit of rebirth**.\n\nTo request **entrustment** from **the departed**,\nIt is **difficult to match past examples**;\nTo **seek guidance** in **youthful years**,\nHow could we **again** be **fellow students**?\n\nOnly in reciting the **wondrous methods of the Incense Forest**,\nAnd passing on the **Void Songs of the Verdant Abyss**,\nShall we **establish a Pure Altar**,\nWith **lamps blazing** to **dispel darkness**;\nAnd **devote ourselves to the Sacred Treasure Sovereign**,\nWith **fragrant incense** ascending to the heavens.\n\nMay our **sincere sincerity** be **fully exhausted**,\nAnd our prayers **directly reach the lofty peaks**.\n\nHumbly, we pray that the **frost and ice of the night office may melt**,\nAnd that **rain and dew** may **pour upon the dark gates**.\n\nThrough **five refining transformations**,\nMay they be **molded anew** in **rebirth**;\nWith **all sins cleansed and released**,\nMay they **once more** behold **the light of clarity**.\n\nThe departed, if they **have awareness**,\nShall **harmonize with sudden enlightenment**;\nThe living, filled with **gratitude**,\nShall **ever more deeply take refuge**.\n\nExtending **universal compassion**,\nAll shall **be saved and guided**.\n\nAbove, we **fulfill** the **Supreme Sovereign’s** **Great Compassion**,\nBelow, we **align** with our servants’ **sincere refuge in life**,\nAnd humbly submit this plea.\n\n**Twelve Vows** completed.\n**Return to the altar**.\n\nThe humble **incense officials and messengers**,\nThe **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Sovereigns**,\nAnd all **attendant spirit officials**,\nShall now **command** that in the **servant’s** past **quiet nights of Dao/Way practice**,\n**Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** shall naturally **generate**,\nAlong with **mushrooms, herbs, and myriad spirits**,\nAnd the **gathering of all True Ones**,\nAt this **incense fire altar**.\n\nMay the **Ten-Directional Immortal Children and Jade Maidens**,\n**Attend and escort the fragrant incense**,\nAnd **transmit** the **servant’s** past **sincere pleas**,\nSwiftly **reaching** the **Supreme, Limitless Great Dao/Way**,\nBefore the **Heavenly Jade Emperor**.\n\n**Praise outside the hall**.\n**Praise outside the door**.\n\n**The Complete Ritual Codes of the Dao Gate, Volume 83 Complete**\n**The Complete Ritual Codes of the Dao Gate, Volume 84**\n*Compiled by Master Guangting Du, with revisions by the Eastern Peak [Mount Tai] Master of Rescue and Salvation*\n**Great Ritual of the Eastern Peak [Mount Tai] – Scattered Altar Dao Practice**\n\n**Ritual Ascension to the Altar as Usual**\nEach pays respect to the Master in accordance with the law.\n**Proclaim the Spirit-Guarding Incantations.**\n\nThe Five Stars shine forth, illuminating the Five Directions.\nMercury repels calamity, Wood virtue brings prosperity.\nMars dissipates misfortune, Jupiter wards off war.\nThe Star of Stability holds firm—blessing the family and state with harmony.\nNames inscribed upon the Jade Tablets, words recorded in the Imperial Archives.\nRiding the gale, scattering brilliance, soaring through the boundless void,\nEntering and exiting the unseen, feasting across the Ten Directions.\nFive clouds float as canopies, summoning spirits and harnessing winds.\nCommanding ten thousand spirits, guarding above with Dao harmony—\n**Striking the Dao Drum twenty-four times.**\n\n**Ignite the Altar.**\n\nThe Most High Three Celestial Primordials—**Heavenly Primordial Beginning of the Three Qi,**\n**Supreme Dao Lord, Supreme Laozi**—\nSummon forth from within the servant’s body:\nThe **Three Five Officials of Merit,**\nLeft and Right Official Messengers,\nLeft and Right Incense-Bearers,\nPostal Dragon Cavalry Officers,\nAttendant Golden Boys,\nIncense-Transmitting Jade Maidens,\nThe Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols,\nDirect-Sun Incense Officials—\nA total of **thirty-six** emerging.\n\nThose who emerge are clad in solemn, resplendent robes,\nWith headgear and trailing ribbons,\nOpening the **Mysterious Altar’s Land and Domain Spirits.**\n\nThe servant, now in quiet night Dao practice,\nHumbly presents this proclamation of intent.\nAll sincere pleas have been recorded and reported—\nMay the **Supreme Dao Qi of the Ten Directions** descend,\nThe **Sacred Treasure Radiance** flow into the servant’s body,\nSo that what is presented may swiftly reach\nThe **Supreme Limitless Great Dao,**\nBefore the **Heavenly Golden Threshold Jade Emperor of the Highest Void.**\n\n**Request the proclamation of rank.**\nThe servant of such-and-such rank, with utmost sincerity,\nHumbly presents to:\nThe **Void-Natural Golden Threshold Seven-Treasured Supreme Emperor,**\nThe **Eastern Palace Patriarch, Great Unity Savior of Suffering, Heavenly Lord,**\nThe **Transmitting Scriptures and Teaching Ancestral True Ones of Past Ages,**\nThe **Eastern Peak Mount Tai, Heavenly Equal and Benevolent Holy Emperor,**\nThe **Virtuous and Illuminating Empress,**\nThe **Crown Prince and Noble Consort,**\nThe **Illuminous Spirit Duke of the Hall,**\nThe **Western Qi Spirit King,**\nThe **File and Martial Officials beneath the Peak,**\nAll **clerks and officials,**\nThe **Three Realms’ responsive spirits,**\nAll **True Spirits.**\n\nThe servant hears:\nAt the **Great Peak, the sacrificial rites were first established,**\nAnd the hunt was revered by the **Yu Emperor;**\nAt the **sacrificial field, the mandate was sought,**\nAnd the **Rites of Ru were held in utmost respect.**\n\n**Translation:**\n\n---\n**Responding to the Wood Virtue’s reign and upholding benevolence,**\nWell able to lead as the first of spring’s seasons,\nWhere life’s origin begins.\n**Indeed, the Mountain Emperor’s benevolence**\nStems from his love of life and hatred of slaughter as his purpose;\n**He governs the celestial populace’s register,**\nAnd records births and deaths as his merit.\n**All these myriad beings, vast and orderly,**\nAre all nurtured by the transformative *qi* of life.\n**How could he bear to oppress those crying out in slaughter’s fields,**\nOr wish to confine them in the dark prisons of the netherworld?\nYet because of the multitude’s ignorance and folly,\nTheir crimes are self-inflicted;\n**Each follows base desires of love and hatred,**\nAnd their greed knows no end.\n**Indulging in licentiousness and deceit in myriad forms,**\n**Giving free rein to cunning and guile in countless guises,**\nIf their crimes are not rectified, they must face judgment;\nIf the law is applied, they cannot escape punishment.\n**Still, they hope for mercy’s tears to absolve their guilt,**\nAnd pray for the prison’s records to be reconsidered.\n**If they can reform, why not cease like the tillers of the field?**\n**If they die in wrong, they will wail as ghosts in the thorny groves.**\n**Thus, they seek pity and plead for life,**\nWishing to amend their faults and atone for their errors,\n**Following the Dao’s Way as a bridge to law,**\n**Conforming to the Dao’s teachings as a lamp of wisdom,**\n**Seeking the Dao’s shelter as a protective cloud,**\n**Relying on the Dao’s compassion as saving rain,**\n**Hoping to bathe in the dew of mercy,**\n**And swiftly rescue souls from the dark night.**\n**With utmost reverence and sincerity, day after day,**\n**Focusing on the Pure Clarity’s realm,**\n**Praying for the descent of the Feathered Canopy’s grace;**\n**Reciting the *Step-on-the-Void* hymns,**\n**Aspiring to the paired clouds’ arrival.**\n**Temporarily departing the Golden Gate,**\n**First, the Nine Phoenixes harmonize in song;**\n**Descending to the mortal feast,**\n**Then, the Eight Cranes dance in flight.**\n**The Holy Will communicates in an instant,**\n**The True Ones come and go in a flash,**\n**Surely granting human desires as Heaven approves,**\n**Responding to the lower’s petitions and transmitting them above.**\n**The servants, with utmost devotion,**\n**Humbly welcome the Sacred Procession.**\n**Descend, O Holy One!**\n**First Offering, Scatter Flowers.**\n\n**The servants, with utmost devotion,**\n**Humbly address:**\n**The Formless, Natural Golden Gate Seven-Treasured Emperor of Heaven,**\n**The Eastern Palace Patriarch, Great Unity Savior of Suffering, Heavenly Lord,**\n**The Transmitting Scriptures and Teaching Ancestral True Ones of Past Ages,**\n**The Eastern Peak Mount Tai, Heavenly Equal and Benevolent Holy Emperor,**\n**The Virtuous and Illuminating Empress,**\n**The File and Martial Officials beneath the Peak,**\n**All clerks and officials,**\n**The Three Realms’ responsive spirits,**\n**All True Spirits.**\n\n**The servants hear:**\n**The Five Peaks are established across the world,**\n**Yet only Mount Tai stands as the foremost.**\n**A hundred spirits converge at the Mountain’s Hall,**\n**For it governs the fate of the people.**\n**Not only does it reveal omens through divination,**\n**But also manifests auspices through signs.**\n**The Sample Stone stood upright,**\n**And the grandson truly succeeded the Tang Dynasty;**\n**The violent wind scattered it,**\n**And the First Ancestor of Qin was ultimately overthrown by the Qin.**\n**For kings, it foretells success or failure,**\n**Yet for the common folk, it determines life and death.**\n**Thus, in memory of the departed,**\n**We do not exceed the common practice.**\n**When moved by emotion, some act out of greed, jealousy, or delusion in anger;**\n**When following desires, others indulge in depravity and extravagance.**\n**The Three Karmas wield the axe of self-destruction,**\n**And myriad sins brew the poison of ruin.**\n**In their past lives, they fell into nets, traps, and pits without knowing;**\n**Now in the underworld, they suffer chains, shackles, and torture.**\n**Though their names and crimes are recorded,**\n**And though they face punishment,**\n**Yet the boundless virtue still hopes for pardon.**\n**The Dao originates from benevolent forgiveness,**\n**And the humble heart dares to seek renewal.**\n**Thus, we rely on the Yellow Hat,**\n**And solemnly present the Pure Rites.**\n**Baring our hearts and pouring forth our sincerity,**\n**We lay bare our words of repentance;**\n**Stretching our necks and focusing our minds,**\n**We earnestly hope for their arrival.**\n**At the Jade Seal’s Enfeoffment Ground,**\n**We envision the Sacred Procession ascending in the Cloud Chariot;**\n**At the Stone Gate’s Descending Meditation Site,**\n**We await the Void’s slow arrival in the Celestial Procession.**\n**With reverence and devotion, we merge our spirits,**\n**And hope for their arrival and blessings, abundant and vast.**\n**Not offering humble baskets of bronze and pottery,**\n**But presenting pure offerings of lotus and orchids.**\n**The rites proceed with the First Offering,**\n**And sincerity is fully expressed in its purity.**\n**Though we are unworthy of the Holy Virtue’s fragrance,**\n**We still present our heartfelt prayers.**\n**May you perceive our sorrow today,**\n**And swiftly free us from the suffering of the underworld’s gate.**\n**The Pure Rites’ words are sincere,**\n**And we solemnly declare them.**\n**Declare the Words.**\n**Carefully examining the language,**\n**Clearly seeing the depths of our grief.**\n**Why must we journey to Qufu’s capital**\n**Before we turn toward you?**\n**Why must we ascend to the Great Treasury’s hall**\n**Before we fully rely on you?**\n**Remembering the departed souls have a home,**\n**It is the Mountain’s Spirit who governs them all.**\n**Nourish their withered flesh and bones,**\n**And grant them the tenfold merit of rebirth;**\n**Endow them with life’s origin,**\n**And open for them the mysteries of the Nine Heavens.**\n**Provide them with the calculations of the Eastern Dipper,**\n**And let them receive refinement in the Southern Palace.**\n**Lamenting the dead and mourning the departed,**\n**Though it is said that humans return to the earth;**\n**Yet seeking rebirth and transformation,**\n**We pray that Heaven grants them form once more.**\n**The servants, with utmost sincerity,**\n**Bow twice, heads touching the ground,**\n**And humbly present the Second Offering.**\n**Scatter Flowers.**\n\n**The servants, with utmost devotion,**\n**Together address:**\n**The Formless, Natural Golden Gate Seven-Treasured Emperor of Heaven,**\n**The Eastern Palace Patriarch, Great Unity Savior of Suffering, Heavenly Lord,**\n**The Transmitting Scriptures and Teaching Ancestral True Ones of Past Ages,**\n**The Eastern Peak Mount Tai, Heavenly Equal and Benevolent Holy Emperor,**\n**The Virtuous and Illuminating Empress,**\n**The File and Martial Officials beneath the Peak,**\n**All clerks and officials,**\n**The Three Realms’ responsive spirits,**\n**All True Spirits.**\n\n**The servants hear:**\n**Heaven does not cut short the lives of the people,**\n**For their original fate stems from self-destruction;**\n**If humans fall into crime,**\n**Even the Sage on High does not hesitate to enforce punishment.**\n**If evil is not punished,**\n**Then virtuous deeds remain unseen.**\n**Since the path is blocked by the Three Pure Ones’ distance,**\n**They must sink into the Nine Underworlds’ depths.**\n**Once fallen into darkness, some endure countless kalpas.**\n**The South’s prison is called Fire Obscurity,**\n**And those who fall there suffer burning brows and heads;**\n**The West’s prison is Iron, the Diamond Fort,**\n**And those who enter are crushed with hammers and pierced with spears.**\n**The Cold of the Northern Abyss is extreme,**\n**Where they suffer the hundred poisons’ frost;**\n**The Central Prison of Universal Sweeping**\n**Is where they fall from the Eight Reaching Trees.**\n**The tortures of the Copper Pillars and the slaughtering fields,**\n**The agonies of the Iron Chariots and boiling cauldrons,**\n**All stem from their past indulgence in desires,**\n**And thus they now endure these sufferings.**\n**Moreover, this Eastern prison**\n**Is also called the Wind-Thunder Realm;**\n\n**Moreover, the spirit of the Lord Guan must surely exert its divine authority.**\n**Fortunate is the radiant light of the Celestial Sage, pervasive and illuminating,**\n**That it does not allow all to be utterly lost in darkness;**\n**Though the Yin Officials enforce strict punishments,**\n**Surely there are also opportunities for leniency.**\n\n**With utmost sincerity and devotion, we earnestly pray**\n**To receive the saving grace and blessings of deliverance.**\n\n**The fragrant incense has already ascended to the Three Heavens,**\n**And the sweet wine is now offered in the second presentation,**\n**Mimicking the arrival of the sacred banners,**\n**And faintly resembling the imperial procession’s presence.**\n\n**We humbly wish to feel the divine response through mutual resonance (交孚),**\n**And that our lamentations may not fall upon deaf ears (无告).**\n\n**Under the radiant gaze of the Vaulted Sky (穹窿),**\n**May we soon emerge from the realms of darkness and light (幽明);**\n**Near the Hidden Mystic Gate of the Celestial Realm (奥天门),**\n**May we immediately depart from suffering and distress (苦恼).**\n\n**May we be permitted to repent our wrongs and turn to goodness,**\n**So that we may attain the Dao and ascend to True Reality (登真).**\n\n**Your humble servants, with reverent devotion, prostrate ourselves twice,**\n**And respectfully present our final offering.**\n**Scatter flowers.**\n\n**Your servants of the lowest ranks, [names redacted],**\n**With profound sincerity and earnestness, humbly address the following:**\n\n**To the Peerless Golden Palace Supreme Deity of the Natural Void (虚无自然金阙七宝上帝),**\n**To the Eastern Palace Great Unity Saving Suffering Celestial Sage (太乙救苦天尊),**\n**To the lineage of scripture-transmitting and doctrine-performing sages across generations (历代师真),**\n**To the Heavenly Lord of Equality and Virtue, the Eastern Peak Tai Mountain (东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝),**\n**To the Virtuous and Illustrious Empress,**\n**To the Crown Prince and the Noble Consort,**\n**To the Radiant Spirit Marquis of the Hall,**\n**To the Mystic King of Western Qi,**\n**To the Heavenly Marshal and the Celestial Officials of the Five Directions,**\n**To all the bureaucratic spirits (一切曹僚),**\n**To the Three Realms that respond to our devotion,**\n**And to all True Spirits (一切真灵).**\n\n**We have heard that since the Dragon Han era produced scriptures,**\n**The path of the Dao has finally been broadly revealed.**\n**From the beginning of the Red Brightness Kalpa (赤明开劫),**\n**The sole purpose has been to guide beings toward liberation.**\n\n**Divine spirits universally flourish,**\n**And the Dao transforms mortals into immortals.**\n**The Holy Mother guards the room while the Marshal oversees the court,**\n**The Record-Keeper registers the deeds while the Life Official determines their fates.**\n**Would they desire to torment the people and cause their suffering?**\n**Rather, they wish to multiply the myriad beings and grant them life.**\n\n**Yet, humans may sometimes incur the offense of defying Heaven,**\n**And thus, the Yin Prisons inevitably fall upon them.**\n\n**When grievances accumulate and the spirits of darkness exact retribution,**\n**Those who sow unvirtuous causes reap great suffering in return.**\n\n**Thanks to the Original Beginning’s sacred decree (符命),**\n**We may hope for timely elevation and advancement.**\n**Also, through the Black King’s esoteric chapters (洞章),**\n**We may be recorded for our meritorious efforts and recommended.**\n\n**Thus, the departed souls may undergo refinement,**\n**And obtain vital *qi* to solidify their essence.**\n\n**In the Northern Capital of Luo and Tang,**\n**To be freed from calamity is to depart from the Spirit Bureau (泉府).**\n**In the Southern Capital’s palace and gates,**\n**The living souls’ fate further depends upon Your divine benevolence.**\n\n**With the sacred talismans in hand and the registers held,**\n**We present ourselves before the Heavenly Lord.**\n**Having received the decree and been granted form,**\n**We circulate through the cosmos,**\n**All owing to the boundless compassion of the Original Primordial (元梵),**\n**And each attaining the lower cultivation at the Mud Mound (泥丸).**\n\n**This ritual master, [name redacted], deeply mourns the departed souls,**\n**Who have yet to ascend to the realm of the living.**\n**In the land of Lu where they were once honored,**\n**They still linger in the Spirit Bureau.**\n**Reflecting on the withered songs of Confucius,**\n**They have long departed from the mortal world.**\n\n**Moreover, their misfortunes remain unwashed,**\n**And they are truly overwhelmed by the Black Poison’s torments.**\n\n**Thus, we beseech the Daoist Realm of Immortal Wandering (仙游),**\n**And fully confess our repentance.**\n**We also purify the sacred space and solemnly arrange the offerings,**\n**Carrying incense and devotion to pledge our hearts,**\n**And bow before the True Spirits to atone for our sins.**\n\n**Now, with the three presentations of wine complete,**\n**And at the fifth watch of the night,**\n**We strive ever harder to be reverent and devout,**\n**Hoping thereby to receive Your gracious favor.**\n\n**We humbly wish to cleanse our transgressions and crimes,**\n**And that Your divine insight may accept our sincerity.**\n**May You deign to acknowledge the merit of the Three Treasures (三宝),**\n**And erase our names from the Black Register (黑簿).**\n**May we soon receive the command of the Nine Dragons (九龙),**\n**And be inscribed in the Green Palace of blessings (青宫).**\n\n**Riding the morning light and ascending toward the luminous (阳翘),**\n**We open the Great Existence and pass through the Mystic Gate (玄户).**\n**Having received our form and undergone refinement,**\n**We attain the Hall of Flowing Fire (流火之庭).**\n**Following our

Repentance)**\n\n**Dawn of Pure Clarity**\nThe humble servants, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and entrust themselves to the **Ten Directions’ Primordial Supreme Daoist Lord of the Soul’s Treasure (无极太上灵宝天尊)**, the **Five Sacred Peaks’ Imperial Saints (五岳圣帝)**, the **Four Great Waters’ Source Kings (四渎源王)**, the **Three Realms and Ten Directions (三界十方)**, all **Divine Beings and Immortals (神仙)**, and the **Assemblies of Spirits (诸灵官)**, devoutly repenting our transgressions.\n\nWe humbly hear that the **Divine Officials’ Celestial Abodes (仙官洞府)**\ncan dissolve calamity and dispel disaster;\nthat the **East Peak Water Sovereign (东岳水司)**\nholds life over death by the **Heavenly Lord’s decree (皇主生而制死)**.\n\nAll under heaven revere and gaze upon them,\nfor they govern the fate of mortal lives.\nA single thought of devotion and reliance\nshall surely earn the **Heavenly Lord’s compassionate regard (帝心之回眷)**.\n\nWe pray for Your gracious pity,\nto look down upon our mortal plight,\nand grant us repentance for our sins,\ncleansing our stains and purging our defilements.\nMay we be absolved of our offenses.\n\nToday’s ritual master, **so-and-so**, deeply regrets the transgressions of the departed, **so-and-so**.\nFrom birth, humans are bound by the **Four Great Elements (四大)**,\nand our senses are formed by the **Six Roots (六根)**.\nFrom the roots arises dust,\nand dust accumulates into defilements,\nwhich grow worse and cannot be concealed,\nleading to grave sins that are hard to escape.\n\nTo rescue the **Nine Nights’ soul (九夜之魂)**,\nwe must repent the **Six Roots’ sins (六根之罪)**.\n\nFor we see the cause of suffering—\nthe **illusion of form (色)**—yet fail to recognize its emptiness (**空**),\nand thus let external things disturb us.\n*\"Do not gaze upon what is improper\"*—\nyet we still bear guilt before **Yan Yuan (颜渊)**;\n*\"Blind yet seeing\"*—\nwe are deeply shamed before **Zhuangzi’s teachings (庄叟)**.\n\nDelighted by the allure of beauty,\nwe indulge in the sight of **splendor and finery (青黄黼黻)**.\nEven more, when gold blinds us to true humanity,\nhow can we scrutinize the **footprints of virtue (视履)**?\n\nSuch sins stem from the **eye-root (眼根)**.\nToday, at this time, we vow to repent.\n\nAgain, if we take pleasure in **lewd speech (亵语)** and incline our ears,\nor revel in **heretical teachings (邪说)** and find joy in hearing,\nwhen we encounter the **whispering voices of clouds and dust (遏云绕尘之声)**,\nwe cannot help but be ensnared;\nwhen we hear the **urgent strings and hasty drums (急弦促柱之响)**,\nwe cannot resist lingering.\n\nBelieving in **erroneous doctrines and wild schemes (谬论狂谋)**,\nwe crave **licentious words and filthy speech (淫言秽语)**,\nyet fail to heed *\"Do not listen to what is improper\"*—\nhow can we claim to uphold **virtue and wisdom (尚德而为聪)**?\n\nSuch sins stem from the **ear-root (耳根)**.\nToday, at this time, we vow to repent.\n\nAgain, if we are intoxicated by **the hundred scents (五臭所熏, 百物交感)**,\nlike guests who steal fragrance in the dark,\nor husbands who abandon all for the **coastal allure (海畔之夫)**,\nchasing only the **pleasing odors (逐臭)**,\nwe demand **rich flavors (厚味)** and compete for the **savor of meat and wine (饮膳之膻香)**;\nwe covet **fine garments and rare fabrics (美衣奇, 绮罗)**,\nand delight in the **scent of orchids and musk (兰麝)**.\n\nYet we do not know that **the nose’s penetration leads to trembling (鼻彻为颤)**,\nand only bring weariness to our brow.\nSuch sins stem from the **nose-root (鼻根)**.\nToday, at this time, we vow to repent.\n\nAgain, if we indulge in **the five tastes (五味)** and cling to **the eight delicacies (八珍)**,\nwe scorn **Yan Hui’s simple fare (颜回之箪瓢)**,\nand prefer **Yi Ya’s elaborate cuisine (易牙之刍豢)**,\nseeking only to satisfy our **mouth’s desires (口腹之足欲)**,\nyet unaware that **the cauldron’s heat breeds resentment (鼎镬之生冤)**.\n\nMoreover, **sweet-tongued treachery (利口覆邦)** and **crafty words that disrupt virtue (巧言乱德)**—\nthese wound like **spears and javelins (矛戟)**,\nand we lack **the modesty of the Duke of Zhou (雅之莫扪)**;\nwe **dishonor the sacred pivot (枢机)**,\nand follow **Zhang Yi’s deceit (张仪之尚在)**.\n\nThus, **words bring calamity (召祸)**,\nyet we fail to see that **taste is also emptiness (味即是空)**.\nSuch sins stem from the **tongue-root (舌根)**.\nToday, at this time, we vow to repent.\n\nAgain, if we seek **the body’s ease (安佚)** and neglect others’ toil,\nor push our **four limbs to their limits (优游)** in self-indulgence,\nwe **boast of our lofty halls and vast mansions (高堂广厦)**,\nand **lust after fine food and silks (美食鲜衣)**,\nmaking ourselves proud while harming others,\nand failing to **relieve the suffering of the world (博济)**.\nWhen told *\"Do not harm others for your own gain (害人而利己)\"*,\nwe **glance with scheming eyes (睢盱)**;\nwhen we **destroy others to fulfill our own desires (坏人以自成)**,\nwe do not consider **bestowing kindness (施恩)**.\n\nSuch sins stem from the **body-root (身根)**.\nToday, at this time, we vow to repent.\n\nAgain, if the **heart’s nature (心妄性本)** is unrestrained,\nand **intentions wander into the field of emotions (意入情田)**,\nwe are **disturbed by greed, jealousy, and rivalry (贪嫉妬)**,\nand **driven by joy, anger, sorrow, and delight (喜怒哀乐)**,\nyet we do not **follow Confucius’ Four Absolutes (四绝)**,\nand only **err in Xun Kuang’s Five Constraints (五綦)**.\n\nWe cannot **subdue the Heavenly Lord (天君)**,\nfor the **mind-monkey (心猿)** keeps escaping;\nwe cannot **restrain the breath-horse (气马)**,\nfor its **wild spirit (志帅)** cannot be tamed.\nWe **abandon what is right for what is wrong (舍是为非)**,\nand **follow what is crooked (径行)**,\nnurturing our nature without **reducing desire (寡欲)**.\n\nSuch sins stem from the **mind-root (意根)**.\nToday, at this time, we vow to repent.\n\nAs above, we repent the **sins of the Six Roots (六根之罪)**.\nWe humbly pray that the **Noble Worthies (高真)** may forgive our offenses,\nthat the **Assemblies of Saints (众圣)** may shower mercy upon us,\nand grant us **awakening after others’ awakening (觉后而觉先)**,\nas well as **rebirth and death in accordance with the Dao (更生而更死)**.\nMay our **black ledgers of karmic debts (黑簿)** be dissolved by accumulated merit,\nand our **red sins of departed souls (朱陵)** be transcended through this ritual.\nMay Your blessings extend to future generations,\nand may we forever dwell under the **Dao’s shade (道荫)**.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way (道)**,\nwe ascend to the **formless (无形)**,\nharmonizing with the **True Dao (道合真)**.\n\n**Midday Repentance for the Ten Directions**\nThe humble servants, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and entrust themselves to the **East Peak Jade Treasure Supreme Heavenly Lord (东方玉宝皇上天尊)**, the **Nine Breaths’ Heavenly Sovereign (九炁天君)**, all **Divine Beings and Immortals (神仙)**, and the **Assemblies of Spirits (诸灵官)**, devoutly repenting and offering thanks.\n\nWe humbly hear that **wood binds us in the world (束为木)**,\nand **virtue governs by benevolence (德主仁)**.\nWhen humans **lose the heart of benevolence (昧仁心)**,\nthey **depart from virtuous conduct (乖仁德)**.\nIf we cannot **repent and purify (忏洗)**,\nhow much longer shall we **accumulate guilt (愆尤)**?\n\nThe ritual master, **so-and-so**, offers this repentance on behalf of the departed, **so-and-so**.\nFrom countless past lives to this present one,\nwe have **forgotten compassion (恻隐之心)**,\nand **lacked the resolve of kindness (宽慈之志)**.\n\nAt home, we **failed to love our parents (爱亲之念)**,\nand **our filial piety was utterly neglected (孝养全亏)**;\nin office, we **did not sincerely care for our lord (忧主之诚)**,\nand **our loyalty and diligence were lost (忠勤顿阙)**.\nWe **ignored the widow, the orphan, and the lonely (鳏寡孤独)**,\nand **did not relieve the suffering of the sick and poor (疾苦困穷)**.\nWe **pushed away those in need (推内沟)**,\nand **deeply regret not offering aid (不被泽)**,\nlike **Yi Sheng’s sorrow (伊生)**;\nwe **laughed at those in peril (有刀)**,\nyet **killed them secretly (潜杀人)**,\nlike **Yi Fu’s hypocrisy (义甫)**.\n\nWe **abandoned our kin (宗族)**,\ncausing **one-sided resentment (相怨於一方)**;\nwe **neglected our brothers (弟兄)**,\nyet **preferred to dwell together in shared deceit (同居而共被)**.\nWe **refused to guide those seeking the Dao (问津莫答)**,\nand **only schemed to harm (挤壑是图)**.\nSince we **failed to practice the Six Virtues (六行)**,\nwe **cannot escape the fate of a single wrongdoer (一夫之不获)**.\n\nSuch crimes **harm benevolence and compassion (宽仁)**.\nWe deeply fear that the departed, **so-and-so**, after death,\nmay fall into the **prison of East Peak’s winds and thunders (东方风雷之狱)**,\nor be **judged under the East Peak Sacred Emperor’s authority (东岳圣帝考官之司)**,\nsuffering in **dark dungeons (幽关)**,\nwith no way to **escape their torments (解脱)**.\n\nToday, with sincere devotion, I **repent and submit** to the **Eastern World’s Jade Treasure Sovereign of Heaven, the Nine-Qi Heavenly Lord**.\n\nI humbly pray that **You command** from **Mount Tai**,\nand **grant me salvation** to **the departed, so-and-so**,\n**washing away all unvirtuous crimes**,\nand **receiving the blessings of the Dao’s virtue**.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way**,\nI shall **ascend to the Formless**,\nand **harmonize with the Dao’s true essence**.\n\nWe, the **officiants**, with sincere devotion, **repent and submit** to the **Southern World’s Mysterious True Ten-Thousand Blessings Heavenly Lord, the Three-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.\n\nWe **humbly hear** that in the **Southern Fire Bureau**,\n**virtue is expressed as propriety**.\n\nIf **humans offend the Fire Virtue**,\nthey **fail to understand the precepts of propriety**.\nWith **accumulated transgressions and sins**,\nthey **must seek purification and absolution**.\n\nThe **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,\nand **repents for the crimes of improper conduct**.\nFrom **countless past lives**,\nuntil **this present life**,\nI **lacked the mind of modesty and humility**,\nand **did not cultivate the spirit of diligence and reverence**.\n\nMy **conduct violated the precepts of humility**,\nmy **actions failed to uphold harmony**,\nI **demeaned the exalted while in lowly stations**,\nand **offended superiors while in weakness**.\nI **neglected the humble seat at feasts**,\nand **pursued precedence on the path of the Dao**.\nI **oppressed my neighbors with arrogance**,\nand **scorned my elders and betters**.\n\nI **sat insolently and sprawled**,\nyet **aspired to equal the Sage**;\nI **walked naked and exposed**,\nyet **never lagged behind the wise**.\n\nHow could I know that **Master Yan** (颜子) **grieved over the faults of sight and hearing**,\nand **remembered the virtues of the ancient kings**—\ntheir **behavior, their words, their demeanor**?\nI **fell into pride and sloth**, which **mutually reinforced**,\nand **arrogance and haughtiness**, which **grew together**.\nThus, **my licentiousness was complete**,\nand **all propriety lost**.\n\nNow I deeply fear that after **the departed, so-and-so’s** death,\nthey may **succumb to the Southern Fire’s dark prison**,\nor **be judged under the Southern Sacred Emperor’s authority**,\n**wandering through shadowed dungeons**,\nwith **no path to liberation**.\n\nToday, with sincere devotion, I **repent and submit** to the **Southern World’s Mysterious True Ten-Thousand Blessings Heavenly Lord, the Three-Qi Heavenly Lord**.\n\nI humbly pray that **You command** from the **Southern World**,\nand **grant salvation** to **the departed, so-and-so**,\n**washing away all crimes of improper conduct**,\nand **elevating them to the realm of joy**.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way**,\nthey shall **ascend to the Formless**,\nand **harmonize with the Dao’s true essence**.\n\nWe, the **officiants**, with sincere devotion, **repent and submit** to the **Western World’s Supreme Marvelous Ultimate Heavenly Lord, the Seven-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.\n\nWe **humbly hear** that in the **Western Metal Bureau**,\n**virtue is expressed as righteousness**.\n\nIf **humans offend the Metal Virtue**,\nthey **fail to grasp the way of righteousness**.\nWith **accumulated transgressions and sins**,\nthey **must seek purification and absolution**.\n\nThe **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,\nand **repents for the crimes of unrighteousness**.\nFrom **countless past lives**,\nuntil **this present life**,\nI **lacked the mind of shame and revulsion**,\nand **willingly endured the insults of others**.\nI **indulged in favors and flattery**,\nand **even betrayed my lord**.\nI **pledged loyalty with severed necks**,\nyet **still sought to sell my friends**.\n\nMy **actions were driven by petty disputes**,\nand **self-interest prevailed over harmony**.\nI **did not ponder Master Meng’s response to the Duke of Liang**,\nbut **only mimicked Song Jiao’s flattery of Chu**.\nIf **I could not resist desire**,\nthen **my nature aligned with Xia You and Ge Ren** (夏癸, 商辛);\nif **I was deemed cruel**,\nthen **my wickedness matched Shang Xin and Jiang Zhi** (商辛, 江志).\n\nI **could not cease from trespassing and harming others**,\nyet **failed to recognize that gradual cultivation leads to the right path**.\nI **took what was not mine**, nearing **theft**;\nhow much more so when **I seized gold in the marketplace**?\nI **executed the innocent**, exceeding **just severity**;\nyet **I manipulated laws to frame prisoners**.\n\nSuch **crimes are beyond redemption**,\nand **no path can absolve them**.\n\nI deeply fear that after **the departed, so-and-so’s** death,\nthey may **fall into the Western Metal’s prison of retribution**,\nor **be judged under the Western Sacred Emperor’s authority**,\n**wandering through shadowed dungeons**,\nwith **no way to escape**.\n\nToday, with sincere devotion, I **repent and submit** to the **Western World’s Supreme Marvelous Ultimate Heavenly Lord, the Seven-Qi Heavenly Lord**.\n\nI humbly pray that **You command** from the **Western World**,\nand **grant salvation** to **the departed, so-and-so**,\n**washing away all crimes of unrighteousness**,\nand **receiving the blessings of the Dao’s ultimate function**.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way**,\nthey shall **ascend to the Formless**,\nand **harmonize with the Dao’s true essence**.\n\nWe, the **officiants**, with sincere devotion, **repent and submit** to the **Northern World’s Mysterious Supreme Jade Chariot Heavenly Lord, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.\n\nWe **humbly hear** that in the **Northern Water Bureau** (居坎),\n**virtue is expressed as wisdom**.\n\nIf **humans offend the Water Virtue**,\nthey **lack the mind of wisdom**.\nWith **accumulated transgressions and sins**,\nthey **must seek purification and absolution**.\n\nThe **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,\nand **repents for the crimes of folly**.\nFrom **countless past lives**,\nuntil **this present life**,\nI **did not discern the rites of right and wrong**,\nbut **only harbored ignorance and stupidity**.\n\nI **knew not myself nor others**,\nyet **claimed to uphold rectitude**—\nhow could I **straighten others while bent myself**?\nMy **eyelashes obscured my vision**,\nand **my heart grew darker with seclusion**.\nI **fixed my gaze on the four cardinal points**,\nyet **my mind was in chaos**;\nthe **Heavenly Lord must know of my two errors**,\nfor **I was lost in deeper darkness**.\n\nI **trampled propriety and violated righteousness**,\nyet **did not recognize reverence and love for elders and betters**.\nI **abandoned trust and betrayed loyalty**,\nyet **failed to understand harmony with friends**.\n\n**Light could not return** when **reflected back**,\nand **deceit now merged with my present folly**.\nThe **Dao/Way is easy to know yet hard to practice**,\nbut **I sought to defy it**.\n**People may know late and awaken late**,\nyet **I still fall short of the common folk’s shame**.\n\nI **toiled in vain, seeking only punishment**,\nand **did not realize truth nor know restraint**.\n**Crimes are hard to avoid**,\nand **wisdom is fully obscured**.\n\nI deeply fear that after **the departed, so-and-so’s** death,\nthey may **succumb to the Northern Boundless Cold’s prison**,\nor **be judged under the Northern Sacred Emperor’s authority**,\n**wandering through shadowed dungeons**,\nwith **no path to liberation**.\n\nToday, with sincere devotion, I **repent and submit** to the **Northern World’s Mysterious Supreme Jade Chariot Heavenly Lord, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**.\n\nI humbly pray that **You command** from the **Northern World**,\nand **grant salvation** to **the departed, so-and-so**,\n**washing away all crimes of folly**,\nand **elevating them to the realm of joy in this very life**.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way**,\nthey shall **ascend to the Formless**,\nand **harmonize with the Dao’s true essence**.\n\nWe, the **officiants**, with sincere devotion, **repent and submit** to the **Northeast World’s Immortal-Saving Supreme Heavenly Lord, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.\n\nWe **humbly hear** that in the **Northern Water Bureau**,\n**the virtue of benefiting others is supreme**.\nIf **humans fail to benefit others**,\nthey **hoard greedily and covet resources**.\nWith **accumulated transgressions and sins**,\nthey **must seek purification and absolution**.\n\nThe **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,\nand **repents for the crimes of greed**.\nFrom **countless past lives**,\nuntil **this present life**,\nI **could not sacrifice myself to benefit others**,\nbut **only sought to harm others for my own gain**.\n\nBut only knowing **worry over insufficiency**,\nhow could one know **one’s share requires no excess**?\nCounting **fields by the thousand** to become a **landlord**,\nhoarding **millions in coins** to become a **money-tyrant**.\n\nNot knowing **life’s swift passage**—like a **fleeting moment**—\none **plucks not even a hair** to avoid misfortune.\nSome **cheat orphans and widows**, seizing their **household wealth** and refusing to return it;\nif **trading as a merchant or peddler**, they **double prices** and take pride in it.\nThey **slander monks and defame Daoists**, utterly lacking **generosity in giving**;\nseeing **starvation or cold**, they **never show pity or compassion**.\n\nThey **lend at double interest**, yet still **covet more**;\nthey **spend hundreds on guests**, already **showing displeasure**.\nHow much more those who **kill for gain**—\n**never sharing wealth** with others.\nSuch **transgressions**, piled high, **bring calamity and ruin**.\n\nIn deepest fear, **the departed so-and-so**, after death,\nwill **fall into the Northeast’s Boiling Cauldron Prison**,\nto be **tried by the Officials of Mount Tai’s Judgment Bureau**,\nendlessly trapped in **dark dungeons**, with **no way to escape**.\n\nNow, with **sincere devotion**, we **repent to the Northeast World’s Immortal-Saving Supreme Heavenly Lord, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**.\nWe **humbly pray** that the **saints show mercy**,\nthat the **departed soul be guided**,\nand that **all greed’s sins be cleansed**,\nso they may **be reborn in the Heaven of Joy**.\nAfter attaining the

Soul-Saving Heavenly Lord, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.\n\nWe **humbly hear** that in the **Eastern Wood Bureau**,\n**the virtue of nurturing life is supreme**.\nIf **humans fail to nurture life**,\n**slaughter becomes rampant**.\nWithout **purification**, how could **transgressions be absolved**?\n\nThe **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,\nand **repents for the crime of slaughter**.\nFrom **countless past lives**,\nuntil **this present life**,\nI **only craved the taste of fat meats**,\nnever **pausing to fear life’s fragility**.\n\nI **drew bows and held arrows**, shooting **birds mid-flight in the clouds**;\nI **cast nets and sank hooks**, dragging **scaled creatures from the depths**.\nBefore **feathers were plucked**, their **manes were already severed**;\nwhile **winds were still being hunted**, their **wings were already broken**.\nDogs, pigs, oxen, and sheep—\nall were **slaughtered to excess** with **blade and spear**;\nchickens, ducks, geese, and wildfowl—\nwere **cooked at will** before my **table**.\n\nTheir **cries echoed before the knives**,\ntheir **blood dripped upon the cooking pots**.\nThough **flayed and butchered**, I **never considered their flesh as my own**;\nthough **boiled, roasted, or fried**, I **only thought of filling my mouth**.\nI **tamed pheasants like Lu Gong’s**, with **no different intent**;\nI **hunted deer like Xi Ba’s**, with **no divergent heart**.\nNot that I **could not bear to see them die**—\nbut **many more perished** because of me.\nSuch **transgressions**, piled high, **must lead to ruin**.\n\nIn deepest fear, **the departed so-and-so**, after death,\nwill **fall into the Copper Pillar Prison**,\nto be **tried by the Officials of Mount Tai’s Judgment Bureau**,\nendlessly trapped in **dark dungeons**, with **no way to escape**.\n\nNow, with **sincere devotion**, we **repent to the Southeast’s Life-Nurturing Soul-Saving Heavenly

over chastity**.\n\nI **schemed for trysts by the Han River**,\nand **planned meetings in the mulberry groves**,\nadmiring the **lush lotus of Bi Pond**,\nand **offering peonies from the Lacquered Brook**.\nA **maiden in spring’s bloom** was **lured by a scholar**,\nnot coming to **trade silk**, but **seeking my schemes**.\n\nIn **fine attire**, I **forced her to yield** like a **captive bird**;\nover **walls**, I **embraced her** like a **maiden’s lover**.\nMy **ambitions sought high rank**—\nthough my **teeth were broken**, I **felt no shame**;\nmy **desires craved union**—\nthough my **heart was pierced**, I **felt only joy**.\n\nI **only knew of painted faces and dyed eyebrows**,\nof **beautiful features**—\nbut **never considered** that **eyes and gestures betrayed** deep **violation of rites**.\nMy **deeds were clear as stealing a brother’s wife**,\nmy **tracks led to abducting a husband’s spouse**.\nSuch **sins**, piled high, **must bring calamity and ruin**.\n\nIn

Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.\n\nWe **humbly hear** that in the **Western Metal Bureau**,\n**the virtue of forbidding wrong is strict**.\nIf **humans fail to forbid wrong**,\n**theft becomes rampant**.\nWithout **purification**, how could **transgressions be absolved**?\n\nThe **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,\nand **repents for the crime of theft**.\nFrom **countless past lives**,\nuntil **this present life**,\nI **did not value the height of Western Mountains**,\nbut **coveted the cunning of Eastern Tombs**.\nWith **eyes watching and hands probing**,\nI **stole by day and lurked by night**.\n\n**For the crime of theft, we now confess:**\n\nAlas, our greed was boundless—\nlike the Xiang of Song, who fell to avarice,\nyet knew not the Dao—\nshameful as Guisheng of Qi, who lacked its way.\n\nNot wealth earned through toil was our aim,\nbut only the art of burglary and bribery.\nShouldering sacks, we rejoiced in sealed cords;\nforcing gates, we scorned locks and bars.\nA dropped hat won us hidden treasure—\nlike Zu Ban’s cunning plunder.\nA shared room demanded false gold—\nyet who could match Zhizi’s honesty?\n\nMarked by rusted hem, we fell to Zhang En’s snare;\neyebrows betrayed us—no escape from Yonghe’s gaze.\nBold in theft, yet cowardly in virtue—\nhow like Wang Cang’s deceitful reliance on guile.\nSuch wickedness accumulated,\nnow we reap our calamity and blame.\n\nWe fear that after death, the departed, so-and-so,\nshall fall into the fiery prison of the Northwest,\nentangled in the Taihua and Taishan officials’ scrutiny,\ntrapped in dark dungeons with no path to liberation.\n\nNow, with sincere devotion, we entrust ourselves to the **Boundless Taihua Heavenly Lord of the Northwest, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**.\nWe humbly pray that the holy ones take pity,\nthat the wandering soul be guided,\nthat all sins of theft be cleansed,\nand that rebirth in the blissful realm be attained.\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend to the formless,\nharmonizing with the Dao’s true essence.\n\n---\n\n**For the crime of broken faith, we now confess:**\n\nThe Heavenly Dao values rectitude and sincerity—\none must preserve truth to align with Heaven.\nWithout rectitude, how can one avoid transgression?\n\nWe, the officiants, now entrust the departed, so-and-so,\nand repent for the sin of dishonesty.\nFrom countless past lives to this present one,\nwe spoke in vain, betrayed oaths and covenants.\nArmor could not save the fallen soldier,\nyet we still claimed safety;\na broken cart’s wheels did not stop our false claims of travel.\nGold, unlike Ji Bu’s word, brought no honor—\nblame fell on friends who trusted us.\nOur sashes differed from Zi Zhang’s honest letters—\nresentment festered in the neighborhood.\nWe did not ponder the unyielding virtue of gold and stone,\nyet still dared to deceive the spirits.\nOur words, once spoken, were soon abandoned—\nlike the ruined speech of Lu’s people.\nOur virtue was divided—\nshameful as the *Odes* of Zhou.\n\nDeceitful and hollow, we deceived both others and ourselves;\ncrafty and false, we failed to move even mortals—\nhow could we hope to sway Heaven?\nWe sought only to blind the world’s blind,\nunafraid of the sun and moon’s judgment.\nWith sincerity lost, how could we escape transgression?\n\nWe fear that after death, the departed, so-and-so,\nshall sink into the dark paths of the underworld,\nentangled in the Three Officials’ scrutiny,\nwith no means of escape.\n\nNow, with sincere devotion, we entrust ourselves to the **Celestial Sovereign of Jade Emptiness, the One-Qi Heavenly Lord**.\nWe humbly pray that the Three Officials intervene,\nthat the departed ascend,\nthat all sins of dishonesty be erased,\nand that the fruit of effortless wandering be attained.\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend to the formless,\nharmonizing with the Dao’s true essence.\n\n---\n\n**For the crime of crookedness, we now confess:**\n\nThe Earthly Dao values sincerity and straightness—\none must walk upright to align with the land.\nWithout straightness, how can one avoid transgression?\n\nWe, the officiants, now entrust the departed, so-and-so,\nand repent for the sin of perversity.\nFrom countless past lives to this present one,\nour bodies bent like crooked hooks,\nour deeds strayed from the straight path—\nwe abandoned the righteous road and trod only the wicked.\nDeceitful and harmful to the good,\ncrafty and jealous of the virtuous.\nThe upright had no place for us—\nlike Yiwu’s stacked arrows in vain.\nThough the land had order, none shared the loyalty of Yu’s arrow.\n\nPraise and blame found no truth in our actions,\nwhile our cunning earned infamy among the shameless.\nA child of five could outwit us in the market’s deceits;\nthough the *Three Hundred Poems* were revered,\nwe knew no shame in hiding our deceit.\nOur efforts were spent in twisting and turning,\nyet we never considered the virtue of returning to rectitude.\nSuch transgressions accumulated,\nbringing only guilt and calamity upon ourselves.\n\nWe fear that after death, the departed, so-and-so,\nshall fall into the Nine Abysses’ prison,\nentangled in the Tangdu and Quancu officials’ scrutiny,\ntrapped in the cold realms with no path to liberation.\n\nNow, with sincere devotion, we entrust ourselves to the **True Sovereign of the Cavern Spirit, the Nine-Piled Earthly Lord**.\nWe humbly pray that Tangdu’s interrogations cease,\nthat Quancu spare the soul,\nthat all sins of perversity be cleansed,\nand that the fruit of effortless wandering be eternally attained.\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend to the formless,\nharmonizing with the Dao’s true essence.\n\n---\n\n**The All-Encompassing Night of Repentance**\n\nWe, the officiants, with wholehearted devotion, entrust ourselves to the **Ten Directions’ Great Yi Savior of Suffering, the Heavenly Sovereign of Tianqi’s Ren and Saintly Virtue, the Auspicious and Illustrious Empress of Pure and Gentle Earthly Virtue, the True Lord of Fate, the Brilliant and Trustworthy Auxiliary King, the Protector of the Realm and Manifested Marquis, the Great King of Western Qi, the True Lords of the Ten Palaces, the Eighty-Four Officials of the Six Divisions, all divine immortals, and all spirit officials**, and humbly repent.\n\nWe hear that even the ancient mirror, though bright,\nmay dim with filth;\nthe luminous toad, though radiant,\nis still obscured by clouds.\n\nThe mirror’s flaw is none—defilement comes from without;\nthe moon’s blemish is false—clouds arise from beside it.\nWhen filth is ground away, the mirror’s light shines clear;\nwhen clouds are rolled back, the moon’s radiance knows no end.\n\nHow much more so for humankind, equally endowed,\nwhose nature is round and bright as dawn.\nYet nature drifts with passion, desire lured by things;\nthe mind neglects nurturing virtue, indulging instead in lust,\nforging sins and evils without knowing,\nforgetting origin, forgetting first principles, and failing to return.\n\nShould one day awaken to this truth,\nall ten thousand offenses shall be swept away.\nThus the Celestial Sovereign opens the great gate of **Yòu** [pardon],\nand the saints widely bestow the transformation of renewal.\nThe benevolent wind stirs, sweeping clean the dust of the **color realm**;\nthe **Dharma-rain** flows, washing away the barriers of countless lives.\n\nWith sincere hearts, all find refuge in repentance—\ntoday’s devotion is exhausted in **returning to the Dao**.\n\nThe officiant **[Name Redacted]**, reflecting on the sins of **[Name Redacted]**, deeply fears that in life,\nhe habitually overcame the true with the false,\nabandoned enlightenment for the mundane,\ndisrespected sovereign and kin,\noppressed and scorned teachers and elders,\nlacked benevolence toward all while hoarding selfishness,\nand condemned others while justifying himself.\n\nThough he piled up rotting grains like ancient dust,\ndid he ever feel pity for the widowed and orphaned?\nThough he feasted on fresh meats and wore fine silks,\ndid he ever truly care for the hungry and cold?\n\nThe net ensnares aquatic and terrestrial **beasts and fish**,\nyet heedless of losing life or body;\nThe whip lashes his household slaves and servants,\nyet does he ever pity their wounds to the bone or flesh?\n\nHe delights in arrogance and pride, boasting of his own virtue,\nand enjoys mockery and ridicule, debasing others to lose their **virtue/power**.\n\nIn weighing and measuring, there is deceit in light and heavy, large and small;\nIn contracts and pawns, there are falsehoods of smearing and erasing.\n\nHe slanders monks and **Daoists**,\ninflicts suffering through cowardice and deceives the simple.\nHe often practices **spells and incantations**, profaning **spirits and gods**,\nrelying on his own might to defy **Heaven and Earth**.\nHe acts brutally in his village and neighborhood,\nand envies the virtuous and the good.\n\nSeeing gold and treasures, he is filled with greed,\nsecretly plotting to seize them;\nDividing fields and property, he enriches himself,\nyet would he ever willingly share equally?\n\nHe privately instructs officials to frame the innocent,\nand conspires with ruffians to assault the virtuous.\nHe seduces noble sons,\nand fraternizes with **Bhikṣuṇī**;\nHe lends without intent to repay and breaks his promises,\nand sells false goods for profit while flaunting deceit.\n\nSuch crimes and sins,\nall stem from **perversity and evil**.\nToday, he returns to the **high and true Daoist masters** with sincere repentance,\nand earnestly seeks profound punishment for his misdeeds.\n\nMay the abundant grace of **Daoist blessings** flow,\ncleansing stains and purifying filth,\nbreaking the dark prison of endless night,\nand pointing out the path to enlightenment for those lost in delusion.\n\nMay his sins be absolved in the **Eastern Palace of Pure Radiance**,\nand swift relief be granted from judgment and retribution;\nMay he be reborn in the **Southern Pure Land**,\nand thereby attain transcendence.\n\nMay he escape the **River of Suffering**,\nand reach the **Shore of Ease**,\nextending even to the **Nine Mystic Realms and Seven Ancestral Abodes**,\nand the **Six Paths and Three Routes**—\nall freed from **Yin曹**, born into **Heavenly Dao**,\nwhere disputes cease for the departed,\nand his sins do not bind those yet to come.\nMay his blessings extend to both the living and the dead,\nand his merit touch all beings.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao,\nhe ascends to the **Formless**,\nharmonizing with the **Dao’s true essence**.\n\n*End of Volume Eighty-Five of the Daoist Canon of Great Rules and Regulations*\n*Beginning of Volume Eighty-Six of the Daoist Canon of Great Rules and Regulations*\n\n**The *Lingbao

Thunder Lords, the City Gods and Warming Departments, the local temples and ancestral shrines,**\nand **all responsive spirits**.\n\nMay they all gaze upon the boundless mercy, pierce through the

thus virtue is the means to attain the Sacred.\n\nIf we **seek the Sacred with our common nature**,\nwe may doubt its **remoteness and inaccessibility**.\nBut if the **Sacred responds to the

and Earth**,\nand without it, Heaven and Earth would **lack their purpose**.\nThe **Divine** is the **source of yin and yang**,\nand without it, yin and yang would **lose their efficacy**.\n\nHeaven does not act without humanity,\nand humanity does not **hold dominion** without Heaven.\nWhen **Heaven and humanity interact harmoniously**,\nthen the **Three Talents** govern together;\nwhen **Divine and ghosts align in accord**,\nthen **one virtue** is **deeply established**.\n\nWe humbly consider the **Divine Positions**—\nthey **consort with Heaven**,\nhold the **ancient Dao**,\nand receive the

thirty-five officials of the Three Five (三五), the left and right envoys, the left and right incense bearers, the courier dragons and mounted officers, the attendants of golden boys and silver girls

symbols,\nAnd yin and yang nurtured the spirit.\n\nAt its inception, humanity was born,\nFirst emerging among all living beings,\nThe divine essence coalesced in the Supreme Extremity (太极),\nThe vital qi condensed in the Heavy Darkness (重玄).\nAll owe their nurturing to the sacred Dao,\nAnd share in the transformation of the natural world.\n\nWe, by fortune, have been granted this life,\nAnd now partake in the human order.\nAs the Three Mystic Caverns (三洞) open their light\nAnd the Five Sacred Scriptures (五文) unfold their profundity,\nWe have glimpsed the Mystic Darkness (玄微) through the jade cases and phoenix tablets,\nAnd explored the hidden depths with the phoenix scrolls and dragon chapters.\n\nYet, though we abide in the world and follow its customs,\nAs time passes, we have not yet ascended to absorb the clouds and stars of the ten directions,\nNor grasped the divine mists of the celestial valleys.\n\nOnly by performing our duties to assist the Original Command (功佐命),\nExpanding the Dao and transforming the age (弘道化时),\nMay we fulfill the Mystic Teachings (玄科),\nAnd hope to manifest the subtle effects (微效).\nMoreover, we now present this petition in accordance with the sacred

day.\nWith reverence, I light the incense and focus my thoughts on the true spirits (真灵).\n\nI follow the ten-directional rites of the Azure Court (十华朝会之仪),\nAnd the three-realm incense-burning format (三境焚香之格).\n\nI pray that the Primordial Sovereign (元尊) may descend to inspect,\nAnd that the Ten-Thousand Saints (万圣) may shine their light,\nCommanding the Five Emperors (五帝) to gather at the Jade Palace (玉宫),\nAnd summoning all true spirits (群真) to the Eight Extremes (八极).\n\nI open the Red Primordial rank (丹秩) of the Southern Celestial Chant,\nAnd increase blessings and longevity;\nI inscribe the Azure script (青文) of the Eastern Dipper,\nAnd flow its auspiciousness to bestow fortune upon all.\n\nNow, in this morning Dao Ritual,\nI request the ritual assembly (法众) to take this first pinch of incense and ascend.\n\nAll join in offering the incense,\nReaching the Jade Purity Palace (玉清宫),\nAnd pervading the sacred realm of the Jade Purity (玉清圣境),\nForming the Azure Pavilion (华盖),\nTo venerate the Great Primordial Lord of the Dao (大罗元始尊).\n\nI pray that this incense smoke,\nAscending directly to the heavens,\nMay venerate the Supreme True Daoist Treasure (无上至真道宝).\n\nWe, the disciples,\nSurrender our bodies, our spirits, our lives,\nAnd first prostrate ourselves to the ground.\n\nWe rely upon the Most High Three Sovereigns (太上三尊),\nThe Ten-Directions Saints (十方众圣),\nAnd pray that with this pinch of incense’s merit,\nThe blessings may extend to the spirits of the ancestral temple and the state (社稷尊灵),\nThe sacred ancestors of the peach (宗桃先圣),\nOur spirits may coalesce in the heavens above,\nAnd the blessings descend to the mortal realm (降福人间).\nMay the Emperor’s longevity mountain endure forever,\nThe Dipper’s Extremity (辰极) align with the Azure Court (齐华),\nAnd the sun and moon hang suspended to illuminate the ten directions,\nThe Primordial Harmony (元和) flow to bring peace to the four seas.\n\nMay the Empress and the Crown Prince,\nReceive eternal blessings of radiant light;\nMay the civil and military officials,\nSpread the imperial designs across the vast ages.\n\nNow, this incense-burning,\nIs an act of surrender to the Dao’s Sovereign (道尊) and the Great Saints of the True Dao (大圣众至真之德).\n\nAfter attaining the Dao,\nWe may preserve the eternal heavens,\nAnd harmonize with the Dao’s true essence.\n\nNow, in this morning

to harm others;\nIn actions and conduct, they act contrary to the True and betray the Dao.\n\nBelow, they chase fleeing beasts;\nAbove, they shoot winged fowl—\nWanton slaughter in the space between blade and board,\nUnrestrained revelry at the feast of cups and dishes.\n\nThus, their misdeeds sink deeper than the Stygian Sea,\nTheir sins accumulate higher than mountains—\nThe Three Corpses [三尸] chant in the vault above,\nThe Five Emperors [五帝] speak in the netherworld below.\n\nThe Master of Life seizes their fate,\nFor their deeds are unkind and their calamities remain.\n\nThe Way of Heaven

fortune,\nIn perfect accord with the *Yì* [《易》];\nAll inauspiciousness must be dispelled,\nConforming to the words of the Daoist Scriptures [仙经].\n\nWe, the *jiào* master and officials, with utmost supplication,\nProstrate ourselves in reverence, offering incense and libations.\n\nWith music played,\nWe, the humble officials and the assembled *jiào* attendants,\nWith sincere devotion,\nAddress

favor,\nWithout doubt deserving the merit of expiation.\n\nHow much more so when we offer our feeble prayers,\nAnd rely on sincerity of speech!\n\nWith earnest intent and reverent devotion,\nMay our words soak into the Sacred Hearing [圣聪],\nAnd our pleas reach the True Listening [真听].\n\nThe *jiào* master, though unworthy of life’s blessing,\nSeeks only what is good.\n\nHe fears the errors of the

Though our hearts yearn to follow, we kneel in reverence to bid You farewell.\n\nAt the sound of the *zhì* [知磬] gong, we chant the Sacred Hymns in Your honor.

      "translated_text": "「Thus, the **Dao/Way** is universally rooted in the **True Spirits**,\nAnd all things are comprehensively governed by the **Transformative Power** [*造化*].\n\nClouds march and rains descend,\nThunder roars and winds rush—\nThe heavens and earth regulate their rhythms, and the **Four Seasons** are established;\n**Yin** and **Yang** harmonize, and all beings flourish accordingly.\n\nShould one extreme be insufficient,\nThen myriad calamities will swiftly arrive.\n\nNow, for the present realm, I humbly submit:\n\n**Spring:** When the fragrant spring arrives,\nSweet dews are yet delayed,\nFearful that the **Sun Prince** [*常旸*] may command too harshly,\nAnd cause the farmer’s duties to fall out of season.\n\n**Summer:** When the ever-bright sun is at its height,\nDark clouds linger without descending,\nFearful that the **Thunderer** [*蕴隆*] may bring disaster,\nAnd that the **Rain Master** [*蕃启*] may fail to act in due time.\n\n**Autumn:** When the autumnal season begins,\nTimely rains are overdue,\nThe fields have long been parched,\nAnd the harvest fears a barren year.\n\n**Winter:** When the severe winter comes,\nAnd we pray for snow,\nAuspicious snow has yet not fallen,\nFearful that **Yin** and **Yang** may lose their order,\nAnd that plagues may arise as calamities.\n\nThus, I purify the **Sacred Altar** [*華坛*] with utmost reverence,\nAnd perform **auspicious expiation** [*吉蠲*] through incense and prayer,\nHoping that the **Essence** of sincerity may be clearly received,\nAnd that the **Grace of the Highest** [*冲贶*] may abundantly descend,\nSo that all may be blessed with overflowing favor,\nAnd the realm may achieve universal abundance and harvest.\n\nWe humbly follow the **Divine Mandate** [*科简*],\nAnd respectfully present our **fasting vows** [*斋诚*],\nWishing that you may inspect and accept them,\nAnd that our petitions may be fully answered.\nAll that we invoke with **mystic intuition** [*玄感*],\nWe submit to

the world** [*筌蹄*] within the **Wondrous Storehouse** [*妙蕴*].\n\nFollowing the **Sacred Patterns** [*秘范*] of the **Spirit Altar**,\nAnd gathering the **ordered rites** [*令仪*] of incense offerings,\nAll petitions made in sincerity,\nMust surely accord with **responsive harmony** [*通感*].\n\nHumbly reflecting,\nWe, your subjects, are frail in nature,\nAnd our understanding of the **Dao/Way** is shallow and indirect.\nWe have long relied upon the **Master of the Tower of Observation** [*楼观之师*],\nAnd mistakenly joined the ranks of the **Celestial Officials** [*星簪之列*].\n\nThe

the **Highest Virtue** [*高真*] may extend compassion,\nAnd the **Supreme Sage** [*上圣*] may grant benevolence,\nForgiving our accumulated transgressions,\nAnd allowing our renewed diligence to be accepted.\n\nThough the **Dao/Way** is **soundless and odorless** [*无声无臭*],\nWe dare not slacken in our **devoted contemplation** [*精思*];\nThough the **spirits** have **wings and authority** [*有翼有严*],\nWe hope to attain **responsive enlightenment** [*灵感*].\n\nNow, the **Sun Prince** [*常旸*] is somewhat excessive,\nSweet rains and auspicious snow have long been delayed,\nThe common folk lament the calamity of drought,\nAnd the **magistrates and prefects** [*郡守、令尹*] are burdened with anxious concern.\nWe strictly adhere to the **Sacred Scriptures** [*宝箓*],\nAnd solemnly invoke the **Pure Field** [*清场*].\n\nPraying that the **Ten Days** [*十日*] may align in harmony,\nAnd that **auspicious dew** [*嘉泽*] may descend in abundance;\nSo that the **Three Springs** [*三春*] may be fully nourished,\nAnd that the fields of the people may be universally moistened.\n\nIn **summer**, dark clouds bind in **active suspension** [*活套*],\nSo that the **Three Crops** [*三农*] may be fully nourished,\nAnd that the **highest plants** [*亢苗*] may be universally refreshed;\nIn **autumn**, dark clouds bind in **active suspension**,\nSo that the **Nine Harvests** [*九秋*] may be fully nourished,\nAnd that all may rejoice in a bountiful year.\n\nPraying for snow,\nThat the **Six Celestial Outpourings** [*六出*] may send the **flying snowflakes** [*飞霙*],\nAnd that **auspicious moisture** [*嘉润*] may descend in abundance;\nSo that the **Three Ascents** [*三登*] may harmonize in omens,\nAnd that we may preemptively celebrate a year of prosperity.\n\nAll beings, whether **sentient** or **insentient** [*动植*],\nAre entirely indebted to the **Transformative Power** [*造化*] for their creation and sustenance.\n\nDisasters sink into the **Nine Earths** [*九地*],\nFortunes

heavens,\nTo honor the Ten Directions’ Supreme Dao/Way Treasure, the Celestial Sovereign.\n\nWith reverence, we dedicate our bodies, our spirits, and our lives,\nProstrating ourselves to the

fail,\nBringing perfect harmony to all.\nMay the four quarters and myriad lands together receive\nThe enlightening transformation of His grace.\n\nNow, we offer incense again,\nAnd humbly rely upon the Supreme Virtue of the Dao/Way Treasure,\nThe Great Sage of All-Pervading Truth.\nAfter attaining the Dao, may we preserve the heavens’ eternal existence,\nAnd align ourselves with the Dao’s true essence.\n\nWith this incense offering’s merit,\nWe pray for the protection and tranquility of the prefectural magistrate\nAnd extend it to all his subordinates.\n\nHumbly we pray:\nMay the wondrous

punishment.\nWith earnest hearts and diligent morning repentance,\nWe sincerely regret our sins and seek forgiveness in the unseen.\n\nMay it be granted to shower rain and snow,\nAnd to moisten all that is without feeling.\n\nWe bow three times.\nWe again solemnly proclaim the sacred titles.\n\nThe undersigned officials, along with the assembled congregation,\nWith sincere hearts, jointly petition:\nThe Supreme Great Three Celestial Deities of the Great Dao,\nThe Most High Heavenly Jade Emperor, the Celestial Sovereign,\nThe Nine Grades of High Perfection,\nThe Ten Directions’ Supreme Sages,\nAll Celestial Deities and Celestial Lords,\nThe True Scriptures and True Masters,\nThe Round Dome’s lofty symbols,\nThe arrayed constellations and stars,\nThe boundless earth and cavernous

through **virtue**, demonic obstacles may not intrude,\nAnd through **goodness**, malevolent fates may not prevail.\nMay we enjoy the **Five Blessings of a complete body**,\nAnd fulfill our **lifelong aspiration to aid all**,\nWith the **young and old of our household** all sharing in rest,\nAnd the **entire assembly of officials and scholars** alike enjoying blessings.\n\nYet we fear that

**Day Palace or Moon Bureau**,\nOr be unexcused in the **Celestial Tribunals or Earthly Offices**—\nAll we beseech for **pardon and universal grace**.\n\nMay the **East’s Green Tablet** and the **South’s Red Script** record their **accumulated goodness**,\nAnd bestow **honor and longevity’s blessings**.\nWhat we pray for may reach the heavens,\nAnd our sincerity may be fulfilled—\nSo that the **departed may escape suffering and ascend**,\nThe **living may extend their years and increase their blessings**,\nAnd all **sentient beings** may thrive in life’s fulfillment.\nAbove, we honor the **Heavenly Sage’s nurturing benevolence**,\nAnd below, we fulfill our **subjects’ sincere devotion**.\nWith reverence, we present this petition.\n\nThe **knowing gong sounds**,\nAnd the **Twelve

      "translated_text": "**With the mundane seeking the Sacred, doubt arises from its lofty distance;\nWith the Sacred responding to the mundane, it shines forth in boundless compassion.**\n\nWe humbly revere the Sovereign of Seven Bends, the Master of Offerings and True Virtue,\nWho penetrates the subtleties of the Dao, delving deep into the Sacred Realm.\nFor seven score and three generations as a Confucian sage,\nSpanning countless centuries through the ages of Han and Cloud,\nIlluminating the brilliance of words and deeds,\nStanding resolute as frost and thunder—\nSlicing through demons in an instant,\nShaking the winds and thunder with but a breath.\nHis benevolence flows like rivers, his grace permeates all;\nHe rescues the Shù people from the jaws of wolves,\nRestoring the Black Thread’s land to the domain of longevity.\nYet the ignorant remain blind, the foolish unaware.\n\nThough the Shù Mountains were carved and stones inscribed,\nTheir virtue cannot be fully recorded;\nThough the Mín River’s waters were drained to ink the deeds,\nTheir glory cannot be fully written.\n\nHow could the Most True, in responding to the common,\nAppear as but a fleeting dream of half a night,\nOr fulfill a single plea in the blink of an eye?\n\nThis is called the Dao’s exalted height—never abandoning humanity,\nAnd virtue’s grandeur—yet claiming no ownership of it.\n\nNow, we, the ritual officials, in awe of your sacred might,\nSolennly open the Splendid Altar,\nHumbly praying for your compassionate gaze to descend,\nAnd for your grace to fulfill our earnest devotion.\n\nWe submit our petition through the Minister of the Gate,\nDaring not to delay—\nOur sacred scripture shall be duly proclaimed.\n\n**Proclaim the words.**\n**Examine the scripture’s sincerity—its truth is manifest.**\n\nWith utmost sincerity and reverence,\nOur hearts pour forth in every word;\nIn solemn purity and devotion,\nWe seem to draw near to the Divine’s discernment.\n\nWe partake in this evening’s grand rites,\nBasking in the radiant fortune of auspicious light—\nAll shall be prosperous, all shall come to fruition.\n\nWe, your servants, are moved to the utmost in pious supplication,\nAnd present our second libation.\n**Music is played.**\n\nWe hear that Heaven acts without action,\nYet relies on divine might for its support;\nThe Great Dao is most wondrous,\nAnd draws upon divine virtue for its manifestation.\n\nLike the twin luminaries illuminating the heavens,\nOr the Northern Dipper as the Emperor’s voice—\nIt is the harmony of virtue and the Dao,\nUniting essence and function in perfect accord.\n\nWe revere the Sovereign of Seven Bends, the Master of Offerings and True Virtue,\nWho walks with Heaven as his companion,\nHolds the ancient Dao,\nAnd receives the Mandate from the Most High,\nCommanding the vast principles of the lower realm.\n\nWhen the wooden horses sweat in battle,\nIt reveals the Great Compassion’s courage;\nWhen the rain-soaked paths burn with fire,\nIt shows the attainment of One’s radiant spirit.\n\nNow, we in awe of your virtue and might,\nOnce more extend our sincere devotion.\n\nMay your presence come without need of summoning,\nDisplaying the boundless wonders of your workings;\nMay all desires be fulfilled,\nAligning with Heaven’s heart to bestow blessings.\n\nWe, your servants, are moved to the utmost in pious prayer,\nAnd present our final libation.\n**Music is played.**\n\nWe, the officials, in utmost sincerity, once more petition:\nThe Sovereign of Seven Bends, the Master of Offerings and True Virtue,\nThe Illustrious and Loyal King of Broad Salvation, Warlike Virtue,\nWho governs the celestial registers and attends with officials,\nAnd all the numinous spirits of the congregation.\n\nWe hear that symbols establish the hierarchy of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd the trigrams weigh the coming and going of great and small;\nNo age exists without relying on worthy talent,\nNo talent thrives without the age’s support—\nThus, the principle of mutual benefit dictates\nThat there must be those who take the lead.\n\nWe reverently behold the vast Heaven and august Sovereign,\nWho turns His gaze westward,\nEntrusting the celestial register to the True One of Seven Bends;\nIncomprehensible in thought,\nHe establishes the mighty hook for the four quarters’ virtuous.\n\nThus, in harmony with the effortless transformation,\nHe achieves the wondrous workings of yin and yang’s awe,\nSpreading joy among all beings,\nAnd opening enlightened governance across the six directions.\n\nWe, the ritual officials, reflect that our nature is dull and blunt,\nOur station low and meager—\nYet we have received the boundless grace of your favor,\nAnd been touched by your unfathomable virtue.\nThough we have long cherished the classics,\nWe have yet to attain the broad path.\nRelying on the Daoist ranks and talismans,\nWe seek to fulfill the scholar’s ambition for officialdom—\nMay the great numbers of your blessings be answered,\nAnd our humble prayers granted:\nThat the firewood of the lower stove may burn bright,\nAnd our remaining talents may flourish;\nThat the moon’s immortal osmanthus may grow anew.\n\nMay the Sacred Sovereign live long, and the four seas prosper in peace,\nHis august might tremble the nine barbarians into submission.\nLet the scholars gather in harmony, achieving the auspiciousness of advancement;\nLet the officials unite in reverence, fulfilling the rites of communication.\n\nMay all living things, great and small, be bathed in your blessings.\n\nWe, the ritual officials, may have impurities of body or mind,\nOr failings in ritual propriety—\nYet with all assembled officials and spirits,\nOur myriad faults and sins,\nWe humbly pray for your boundless compassion to descend,\nAnd grant us pardon—\nAbove, to honor the Divine’s boundless grace,\nBelow, to fulfill our collective pious devotion.\n\n**We proclaim the Twelve Wishes.**\n**We focus the spirit and burn incense.**\n\nThe High Functionary restores the censer.\nThe Incense Officials, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,\nAnd the attendant spirit officials of incense—\nLet them command that the place where I once stood in quiet night,\nAscending the altar to practice the Dao,\nShall naturally produce golden elixirs and jade-green herbs,\nHundreds of numinous plants,\nAs the spirits gather here before this censer’s flames.\n\nMay the celestial children and maidens of the ten directions\nAttend the fragrant mists,\nAnd swiftly convey my sincere petition\nTo the presence of the Most High, the Supreme Dao of Non-Extreme,\nThe Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty.",

humble offerings, one may venerate the numinous spirits.\nIf one offers prayers with pure intent and concentrated devotion,\nSurely one’s wish for celestial descent will be fulfilled.\n\nThis humble *science-officer* [醮官], **[Name]**, steadfastly upholds the Confucian path,\nAspires to success in the imperial examinations,\nAnd earnestly hopes that the **Divine Treasures** [灵宝] may grace him with rules of reverence,\nAnd that the **Sacred Talismans** [仙箓] may mark his rites with hallowed authority.\nWith utmost sincerity, I establish a solemn altar,\nTo atone for sins and purify my person,

the **Heavenly Pattern** [法天] and **Earthly Symbol** [象地];\nIn modest scope, I offer libations of water and flowers,\nReciting the **Cloud Chapters** [云章] of the *Jade Saddle* [玉笈],\nAnd chanting the

      "translated_text": "The humble servant hears that the transformations of the Most High God must be measured by those who follow the Dao in their deeds, and the gates of all wonders must be sought by those who grasp the mysteries of wondrous things. In silent exploration of the ever-renewing principle, and in secret mastery of the ceaseless functions, all things flow in form, spanning heaven and coiling earth. Only the august Sovereigns of the Three Realms and the ranked Saints of the Ten Directions are vast beyond the rivers and seas, lofty beyond the mountains and peaks—yet their blessings endure through the unbroken lineage of their descendants, and their virtue is revered by all virtuous folk.\n\nThe **Taoist Official of the Ritual Hall**, [Name] of modest virtue, though unaware of his own merit, has accumulated good deeds that now shine forth. At the outset, he sought the harmony of his descendants; at the end, he prayed that this son might be forever preserved. Together, they align their forms with the Nine Qi and share their fate with the Three Primordials. The **Born Gods** respond in reverence as they do in song, and the **Minister of Fate** obeys with respect as he does with deference. They examine the month of birth and expand the functions of life, harmonizing the Six Qi at the Great Balance and opening the Eight Desolations into the Domain of Longevity. Thus may they attain enduring blessings and maintain a solemn, reverent heart.\n\nIn accordance with the Daoist rites, I now invoke the True Vehicles, praying for the prosperity of my descendants from the Sacred Axis and offering sincere devotion to the Jade Void. As the first wishes are uttered and the grand rites commence, I give thanks to Heaven and Earth for their creative grace and pray for the longevity and prosperity of my descendants. The humble servants, with utmost reverence, prostrate themselves twice and present incense. Pure tea is offered in tribute. Flowers are scattered.\n\nWith sincere hearts, we now address the **Natural Three Pure Ones of the Void**, the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**, and the ranked Saints of the Three Realms and Ten Directions.\n\nThe humble servant hears that the **Work of Transformation** secretly moves within the floating, dreamlike realms of the **Dharma Realm**, while the **Great Dao** remains hidden yet reveals its virtue of nurturing life. It divides the Three Talents to establish order and distributes the Nine Qi to form all things. All people under heaven are born through the nurturing of their parents, yet their essence connects to the **Jade Purity**, and their spirits are transformed by the **Primordial Origin** as it sows its essence and moves its spirit, universally delivering all beings.\n\nThus, reflecting inward, one finds that one’s fate is decreed by Heaven. Since the **Taoist Official of the Ritual Hall**, [Name], took his wife, no child has been born. Fearful of failing to uphold the ancestral rites and grieving that the line of sacrifice may not continue, he now humbly appeals to the High Saints, guiding and welcoming their blessings. With sincere devotion, he follows the ritual precepts and invokes the sacred altar.\n\nNow, as incense is burned, I turn my body, my spirit, and my fate toward the **Boundless Dao of the Ten Directions**, wishing to dedicate these merits to all beings, seen and unseen. May the Three Realms shine their light, and all spirits guard and protect. May they perceive this sincere red heart and illuminate it, and may the winds of the **Celestial Chariot** descend to attend. May my petition be inscribed in the Imperial heart, and may my descendants flourish eternally. The divine response shall be conveyed to the **Supreme True Boundless Dao** on high.\n\n**Chanting the Square**, **Repentance**, **Three Invocations**, **Three Offerings**. The **True Scriptures** are proclaimed. The **Law Positions** are solemnly repeated. The humble servants, [Name] and the assembled officials of the altar, with sincere hearts, now address:\n\nThe **Supreme Boundless Dao**, the **Sovereigns of the Three Realms**, the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**, the **Great Sovereign Emperor of the Hook-and-Line**, the **Great Sovereign Emperor of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure and Northern Pole**, the **Earthly Sovereign Empress Who Follows Heaven’s Law**, the **Nine Sovereign Emperors of the Divine Constellations**, the **Celestial Sovereign Emperors**, the **Celestial Sovereign Emperors of All Realms**, and all **True Spirits** who respond to invocation.\n\nThe humble servant hears that in the **Primordial Ancestral Eon**, the **Origin** gave birth to all heavens; when the **Two Complements** emerged from the womb, the vast oceans and lands were established. The seven orifices were carved from **Chaos**, and the five sacred marks were planted by the **Divine**. When the winds return, they fan the **Azure Palace** with empty song; when the mists gather, they pierce the **Purple Void** with lush brilliance. Distinguishing life and classifying beings, they open the way for all things and fulfill their functions; observing footsteps and omens, they reveal the lessons of blessing the virtuous and punishing the licentious. All transformations of things dare not ignore this heartfelt devotion.\n\nThe **Taoist Official of the Ritual Hall**, [Name], has cultivated the cause of countless eons and the Daoic nourishment of the Three Primordials. Reflecting on the aged without children—called \"lonely\"—he laments the plight of the common folk, yet knows that Heaven’s greatest virtue is to give life. Thus, he follows the ancient teachings and devotes himself to incense and offerings, humbly beseeching mercy.\n\nThough unworthy, the humble servants have been entrusted with this ritual office and now reverently perform the **Taoist Rites**. To preserve the living and restore the extinct is to rely upon Heaven’s might; to benefit all beings and nurture life is to spread the Dao’s transformations. With sincere hearts, we dare not fail to report this, and with true devotion, we now proclaim our petition.\n\nThe words are examined in detail, and the utmost sincerity is revealed. We humbly pray for Heaven’s attentive ear and its gracious, far-reaching blessings. We consider the officials of the Nine Heavens and the ministers of the Three Realms—those who record crimes and deeds, who always present their petitions in order. Both seen and unseen shall rely upon this, with nothing great or small omitted.\n\nNow, the **Taoist Official of the Ritual Hall**, [Name], has purified his spirit and devoutly observed the fasts, modeling himself after Heaven and Earth. He has erected the star altar, offered water and flowers, and taken refuge in the Dao’s treasures. He recites the **Sacred Chapters** at noon and in the pure night, presenting cloud-inscriptions to the heavens. The **Upper Saints** descend, and our highest wishes are extended. Incense is burned to demonstrate sincerity, spread throughout the Ten Directions; lamps are lit to continue their glow, illuminating the Nine Nights.\n\nIn accordance with the fast’s precepts, we now host the invocation and report it to the **Supreme Three Honored Ones**, the **Ten-Directional Saints**, the **Great True Master of the Mysterious**, the **Supervising Master of the Fast**, the **Most Sacred Treasures of the Lingbao**, and the officials of the Three Realms. May they descend to inspect and review what has been presented.\n\nWe pray that the **Attendant Spirits of the Scripture**, the **Supervising Officials of the Ministry of Punishments**, and the **True Officials of the Lands and Districts** may cooperate in heart and strength, encircling and guarding, sweeping away external forces, purifying the altar, subduing demons and spirits, and annihilating malevolent influences. Thus may we attain peace of mind and stillness of spirit, with divine responses clearly communicated. When the rites are complete, we shall continue to report, and the fast shall be fulfilled without obstruction.\n\nOn the following morning, the Dao will be enacted, and further reports shall be made. This is now declared.\n\n**The Twelve Vows** are recited. The incense burner is relit. The **Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon and Tiger Lords**, and the **Attending Spirits of the Incense** shall now cause the place where the humble servant has invoked the Dao to naturally produce **golden elixir and jade-green herbs**, **hundreds of sacred plants**, and the gathering of all True Ones before this incense burner.",

Realms**,\nAnd **all True Spirits**.\n\nI, **a Daoist Official**, humbly reflect:\nSince my **past lives** until this present birth,\nMy **mind-monkeys** have galloped wild,\nMy **heart-demons** have raged unrestrained,\nShaming **Heaven and Earth**,\nDefaming **sages and teachers**,\nDisobeying my **two parents**,\nSevering ties with my **nine clans**.\nI have **forgotten filial piety**, neglected rites—\nSometimes **not venerating** my **ancestors**;\nOr **abandoning children**, **destroying fetuses**,\nLong ago **inflicting harm** upon my own **kin**.\n\nWith **treacherous deceit**, I **offend superiors**,\nConceal the **virtuous**, harm the **able**,\nGleefully **corrupt** without restraint,\n**Hoarding grain** while ignoring the people’s suffering.\nIf **profit** lies at the

sects**;\n**Exploiting orphans**, **ravaging graves**,\n**Cunningly expanding** my own **fields and gardens**.\n\nI **lack compassion**—\nMy deeds are those of the **tyrant and oppressor**.\n\nOr I **burn mountains**, **exhaust marshes**,\n**Boil silkworms**, **overturn nests**,\n**Wrongfully harming** **all living beings**,\nYet **unfulfilled** my **past karmic debts**,\n**Bringing ruin upon myself**,\nAnd thus **offending the Divine**.\n\nOr as a **subject**, I **fail in loyalty**,\n**Condemning men to death** under false pretenses.\nI **exhaust the people**, **disturb the masses**,\nBecoming the **chief of calamity** in an age;\nI **hold office without merit**, **feasting idly**,\n**Wasting Heaven’s work** among the **hundred officials**.\nI **fell the sacred cows** of

**licentious partners** in my home,\nAnd **extinction of my lineage**,\n**Lacking virtue and greatness**,\nMy **clan shall fall**.\n\nThese are the **precepts of the sages**,\nAnd **Heaven’s will** is **dreadful indeed**.\nThus, I **preserve sincerity**, **purify myself**,\n**Rectify my past**, **cultivate my future**,\nWith **vigilant devotion** all day long,\nAnd **trepidation** in my smallest thoughts,\n**Confessing my karmic sins**,\nAnd **humbly beseeching mercy**.\n\nI pray that the **vast and august Heaven**,\nThe **magnificent Sovereign Emperor**,\nMay **unleash the great virtue of life-giving**,\nAnd **bestow boundless compassion**,\nSo that **all may renew their hearts**,\nAnd **this humble clan** alone **may be spared**,\nIts **lineage preserved**, its **rites

favor**,\n**Emulate the virtuous descendants** of the **Empress**.\n\nMy **earnest prayers** are **offered day and night**,\nAnd **prolific blessings** depend **on moral cultivation**.\nThe **lonely one in Zhao** became a **feudal lord for ten generations**,\nAnd the **meritorious in Liang** was a **prime minister for eight**;\nSome **advised their rulers** and **earned descendants** like **Zang

virtue**.\n\nIf **one perseveres in difficulty** afterward,\n**Dragged by past deeds**,\nYet **reviews ancient precedents**,\n**Heaven’s warnings** remain clear.\n\nThe **Han Marquis** who **broke the law**—\nHis **clan perished** in **four or five generations**, leaving **no survivors**.\n**Yu Xu** who **harbored many grudges**—\nHis **lineage died out** in **twenty years**, **not passing a single mouth**.\n\nSome **schemed treacherously** and **overthrew their rulers**,\nOthers **plotted to destroy** the **Three Dynasties** and **ruin their clans**.\nEven if **one receives the jade seal** and

**Heaven’s condemnation** is **plainly evident**,\nEven if **other virtues** exist, **none can redeem** it.\nIf **one sees their faults** and **reflects inwardly**,\nThey shall **return to righteousness**—\n**No greater joy** than this.\n\nI, **a humble petitioner**, dare **not defy Heaven’s might**,\nBut **submit to the creative transformation**,\nAnd **pledge from this day forward**,\nUntil **future lives**,\nTo **rectify my errors** and **renew my heart**,\nAnd thus **invite auspicious fortune** and **gather blessings**.\n\n**Life and its beginnings** rely **on the interplay of Heaven and Earth**,\n**Form and completion** owe **their debt to Heaven and Earth**.\n**Early signs of good fortune** descend,\n**To comfort all beneath**,\nAnd **to reveal Heaven’s great mercy**,\nWhile **below**, my **sincere submission** is **fulfilled**—\nThus, I **humbly present** this **petition**.\n\n**Twelve Vows** are **restored**.\nThe **Incense Official and

Ancestral Domain** [九原] in shame before the **ancestral spirits** [先灵].\nI behold only my fading shadow,\nA fragile thread that may not break.\nWith age, I am dishonored in **Jiàng Xiàn’s** [绛县] muddy depths,\nLike the **Ghost’s Weeping** [鬼哭] at **Ruò** [若敖],\nI am near exhaustion in my search for sustenance.\nEach day, I feel isolated and fearful,\nAnd constantly tremble in prayer to Heaven.\n\nMoreover, the **litigation of Yú’s Tomb** [虞冢讼] entangles me,\nI beg for **Great Mercy** [洪恩] to universally deliver all.\nThus, I purify my dwelling,\nAnd offer **sincere homage** [嘉诚]

grace**,\nAnd that the **imperial lineage** may endure **without bounds**.\n\nMay the **empress and consorts** bear **auspicious omens** of **peace and abundance**,\nAnd the **matchmaking officials** display **divine signs** of **harmony and union**.\n\nMay the **heir apparent** receive **favor and blessings**,\nAnd the **imperial records** shine with **augmented glory**.\n\nMay the **ruler and

      "translated_text": "Subsequent generations thus retained this practice, establishing methods of exorcism and disaster warding.\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty under Emperor Huán, at the New Year’s grand assembly with his ministers, Lè Bā held wine and spat toward the southwest. The Emperor asked the reason, and he replied: *\"Shu is suffering from a fire calamity, so I am warding it off.\"* The Emperor sent envoys to investigate, and indeed, it was said that a great rain came from the northeast, carrying the scent of wine within—this was a method of salvation and relief.\n\nIn the past, when *Xīnghuǒ* (Mars) occupied the *Xīn* (Heart) constellation, corresponding to the celestial division of the State of Sòng, Duke Jing of Qi was troubled by it. He then issued three imperial edicts, and the calamity shifted three times.\n\nWhen **Liú Kūn** governed Jianglíng, a household fire broke out. Kūn knelt before the flames, begging forgiveness, and soon, the wind reversed, extinguishing it—this was a method of turning disaster.\n\nFor indeed, the coming of calamities and blessings all stem from human summoning. The Heavenly Will is benevolent and loving, and the Dao permits supplication and exorcism. Now, certain Daoist practitioners—[names omitted]—with sincere devotion, have constructed a solemn vow-fire exorcism ritual platform. They command us to proclaim the rites and regulations, to pray for blessings and ward off disasters, and to safeguard the peace of the land.\n\nAt the beginning of the platform’s establishment, if we do not first recite the ritual matters and expound the precepts and prohibitions, how then can we move the High Celestial Spirits?\n\nNow, we shall proclaim the **Ten Precepts for the Ritual Platform** to all assembled here, that each may receive and uphold them. Listen carefully:\n\n**The First Precept:** Do not disturb the body and spirit. Maintain unwavering focus—let joy, anger, sorrow, and delight not arise within. Strive for clarity and precision to commune with the Most Holy Above.\n\n**The Second Precept:** Do not treat the Sacred and True with arrogance or neglect. Hold reverence and awe, gazing upon the honored images. With sincere devotion, the Heavenly True Ones descend from the void to receive you.\n\n**The Third Precept:** Do not slight the Sacred Scriptures. Hold them with faith and weight. Study, recite, and ponder the Three Caverns’ classics, awakening to their truth and seeking the fruit of the Dao.\n\n**The Fourth Precept:** Do not slander the Dao’s teachings. Hold them with respect, spreading the Way and clarifying the Law. Save both the living and the dead, guiding all to take refuge and gain liberation.\n\n**The Fifth Precept:** Do not defile the ritual grounds. Maintain purity—bathe and fast before approaching the sacred platform. Avoid foul odors, blood, and slaughter. Keep poultry, dogs, and livestock from intruding.\n\n**The Sixth Precept:** Do not indulge the body and mind—no shouting, cursing, idle chatter, or drunken revelry. Serve the Celestial Worthies with solemnity, as before one’s sovereign and parents.\n\n**The Seventh Precept:** Do not falter in Daoist resolve. Hold firm—let no petty frustration extinguish your sincerity. Persevere in devotion, and boundless blessings shall follow.\n\n**The Eighth Precept:** Do not neglect the ritual duties. Be diligent and earnest—chant the Dao, recite the scriptures, and pay homage to the True Ones. Let your merits be complete, that both the living and the dead may share in the grace.\n\n**The Ninth Precept:** Do not err in petitioning or ritual offerings. Be precise—if reckless or careless, without proper deliberation, the Three Heavens may reject your supplications, turning blessings into misfortune. This is deeply to be feared.\n\n**The Tenth Precept:** Do not haggle over profit. Be humble and yielding—let giver and receiver both rejoice, without resentment. Do not harm your own field of merit.\n\n**These Ten Precepts—can the assembled officials uphold them?**\n*Answer:* We can uphold them.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy speaks: *\"When petitions are made and the Dao is practiced, the Four Heavenly Sovereigns ride upon flying clouds in green palanquins and eight-scenery jade carriages. Attended by True Persons and Jade Maidens bearing flower-adorned banners, they are preceded by phoenix hymns and followed by the Celestial Balance. White cranes and lions chant in unison, while incense smoke and scattered flowers drift from the void. Those who observe the rites and hear the Law shall see the Heavenly True Ones descend, and all spirits gather in homage. How then can one not exhaust the fullness of the ritual?\"*\n\nFirst, receive the Ten Precepts, then practice the Dao. Walk with measured steps, quiet the mind, and still the will. In sitting, standing, or repose, do not stray from proper form.

The **Great Bear** governed the world, the **Golden Mother** transmitted talismans, and the **Great Ruler** presented his **full array**. The **Heavenly Symbols**, though hidden, were revealed; when **one person elevated his virtue**, the **Ten Thousand Worlds** shone in prosperity. When **one hundred rulers obeyed in harmony**, the **thousand generations** followed with reverence. All ascended to their **assigned stations**, dwelling at the **Center** to **dispense virtue**.\n\nNow, the **fragrant winds** follow the **heavenly rhythms**, the **fear of the sun’s brilliance** is timely.

      "translated_text": "The **Dao Master** [醮主] of humble name, deeply concerned by accumulated karma inviting calamity, humbly composed this supplication and petitioned for divine favor. With reverence, I dare to unfold my sincere words before the **Celestial Assembly** [法席], and now solemnly proclaim them.\n\n**Proclamation of the Supplication:**\n\nAs the words declare, my sincerity is profound and earnest.\n\nThe Dao Master, born in this age of wondrous transformation, has long revered the **True Wind** [真风]. Now, at the height of summer’s heat, the **Mars** [荧惑] traverses its degree. Though I have always relied upon **virtue** [德], my heart has long held **awe and reverence** [祇畏]. Yet when disasters arise, I must invoke the **preemptive rites of warding** [预禳之典].\n\nI recite the **secret incantations of the Precious Scripture** [宝经], reveal the **true characters of the Cloud Sigil** [云篆], and present the **wondrous patterns** [妙范] in full array, with all rites meticulously observed. **Heaven and humanity interact**, relying upon the **sublime essence** [精祲] to incline in devotion; the **ritual implements are abundant**, and the **fragrant offerings ascend in splendor** [馨香之昭格].\n\nWith the **multitudes of the True Ones** [众真] in attendance, I gaze upon the **Celestial Sovereign’s lofty seat** [上帝之端居], my single mind devoted in reverence, as the **hundred spirits converge**.\n\nI humbly pray that the **Dragon Banner and Phoenix Canopy** [龙旗凤葆] may open **auspicious blessings** [休祥] upon the lower realms, and that the **Sun’s Chariot and Radiant Clouds** [日毂霞车] may amplify the **sublime might of the Celestial Officials** [炎官之威烈].\n\nYour servants, overwhelmed by this petition for grace, now present the **first offering of wine**.\n\n**Scatter flowers.**\n\nI have heard that **diligence in ending as one begins** [谨终如始] is the foundation of human conduct, and that **fearing calamity while turning to virtue** [惧灾向善] is the natural order. Life’s formation depends upon **Heaven and Earth** [乾坤], and all motion and stillness are governed by **Water and Fire** [水火].\n\n**Yin and Yang** [阴阳] form the cosmic framework, overseeing **spirit and vital essence** [魂魄]. In winter, they govern affairs through the **Hour Star** [伺辰], and in summer, they wield authority through **Mars** [荧惑].\n\nNow, in this ninth month of summer, the **Three Stars** [三星] appear in the twilight. How could one not recognize that the **cyclical records of the ancient sages** [阏伯之纪时] align with the **procession of Zhurong** [祝融之行度]?\n\nThe Dao Official, reflecting upon my mundane existence and my place among humanity, kindles fire by day and lights the **Dao’s lamp** [烛道] by night. Though my actions depend upon **human flame**, I may yet fall prey to **celestial disaster** [天灾].\n\nThe **impartial virtue** [无私之德] is boundless, yet common folk ever fear their **transgressions** [有过之民]. With utmost sincerity, I purify my **community altar** [祓社], heeding the **exhaustive rites of Zheng Xia** [郑侨之尽礼], yet I lack the **insight of the Fire Official’s omens** [裨灶之知天].\n\nI now unfold the **secret scriptures** [秘典] once more, bearing my wishes before the **Lofty True Ones** [高真], hoping the **Heart Star** [心星] may retreat and restore the **Celestial Degrees** [天度] in the **high vault** [高穹], nurturing the **abundance of all things** [万物之丰成], so that all beings may **cross safely** [群生之共济].\n\nMay we **roast or boil our offerings** [可燔可炙] without fear of **poisonous winds** [扇毒之虞], and may we dwell and reside **without dread of shifting flames** [徙薪之虑].\n\nNow, the **lotus lamps** [莲灯] flicker toward extinction, yet the **glowing sun’s remnants** [赫曜日之余光] persist. The **precious sigils** [宝篆] are fading, dissolving into the **light mist of floating clouds** [浮云之轻霭]. The **thousand True Ones** have gathered, and the **three offerings** [三献] have concluded.\n\nThe **Dragon returns to the Vermilion Celestial Heights** [丹霄], and the **Phoenix attendants** [鸾仗] prepare to withdraw to the **Crimson Palace** [绛阙]. Fearful of further presumption, I dare not linger beneath the **imminent celestial威**.\n\nI further pray for **boundless compassion** [洪慈] to descend, granting **forgiveness and mercy** [宽贷].\n\nYour servants, overwhelmed by this final petition, now present the **concluding offering of wine**.\n\n**Scatter flowers.**\n\n**Reaffirm the Dao’s station.**\n\nThe humble servant of lowly rank, **Dao Official** [醮官], now humbly reiterates this supplication to the **Nine Pure Ones, Supreme Saints** [九清上圣], and the **True Spirits of the Three Realms** [三界真灵].\n\nYour servants have solemnly performed the **ritual of the sacred censer** [祭爟之仪] to purify the **original calamity** [燎原之厄].\n\nTo the **Supreme Saint of the Jade Capital** [玉京上圣], who receives the **auspicious radiance** [迂景] upon the **Purple Altar** [紫坛], and to the **Stars of the Southern Pole** [南极众星], who also incline their light upon the **embroidered seat** [黼座], we have already exhausted the **flowing wine offerings** [流霞之献] and now ascend the **bright candles’ glow** [明烛之辉].\n\nAgain, we pour out our **earnest prayers** [沥恳] before the **Heavenly Hosts** [诸天], beseeching the **cessation of calamity** [弭灾] from the **Celestial Symbols** [上象]. Having already unfolded the rites at **Mars’ degree** [荧惑之度], we now extend our **sincerity to the Variable Star** [变化之星].\n\nOnly the **residual light of the Law** [执法之余光] disperses the **flaming essence** [炎精] to demonstrate **divine retribution** [示罚].\n\nThe **Dawn Star** [析旦] grows strong in **sovereign governance** [君道], and **Zhaoming** [昭明] presides over **war and mourning** [兵丧]. **Chiyou’s banner** [蚩尤如旗] signals the **sovereign’s campaigns** [王者之征伐], while **Tian Chan** [天搀如剑] foretells the **slaying by generals** [将帅之杀伤]. **Si Wei** [司危] serves to **pacify discord** [平乖争], and the **Red Comet** [赤彗] wields **authority over extermination** [掌诛灭]. These are all **phenomena linked to the Sun** [附日而有象], yet there are also those **associated with the Moon** [因月而垂芒], such as the **Heavenly Obscuration** [天阴晋若] and the **Celestial Official’s Outbreak** [天惑官张].\n\nThe **Red Comet’s strange hues** [赤若异彩] and the **Heavenly Chui’s anomalous forms** [天崔殊形]—all are **officials of calamity** [灾厄之官], each with their **mandate of oversight** [照临之分].\n\nWhen they descend, they become the **Wind Lord** [风伯]; when they manifest as deities, they are called the **Fire Spirits** [火精].\n\nTheir **flames and forces** [势焰] surge in tandem, their **portents and marvels** [光怪] intertwine. I pray that, under the **Celestial Sovereign’s Dao-essence** [天尊之道炁], the **residual might of the Fire Virtue** [火德之余威] may be fully harnessed.\n\nMay the **nation’s path be unburdened** [国步无艰], lest **martial might be unleashed upon the multitudes** [扬威於多垒]; may the **realm rejoice in prosperity** [邦家有庆], so that the **four classes may pursue their labors in harmony** [乐业於四民].\n\nMay there be no **small conflagrations consuming stables** [焚厩之小栽], nor **premonitory warnings of bandits on the roads** [表道之先警]. May the **summer rains arrive in season**, so that **epidemic miasmas** [沴气] do not arise, and may **Yin and Yang harmonize**, yielding **abundant harvests year after year** [年谷屡丰].\n\nYet I still fear the **Five Stars’ transgressions** [五星凌犯] and the **comets’逆流**, for if they appear in the **eastern quadrant of the Azure Dragon’s seven mansions** [青龙七宿分野], I beseech the **True Characters of the Green Emperor** [青帝真文] for **dissolution and warding** [解禳].\n\nIf the **Five Stars transgress and the Red Comet逆流** in the **southern quadrant of the Vermilion Bird’s seven mansions** [朱雀七宿分野], I beseech the **True Characters of the Red Emperor** [赤帝真文] for **dissolution and warding**.\n\nIf the **Five Stars transgress and the White Comet逆流** in the **western quadrant of the White Tiger’s seven mansions** [白虎七宿分野], I beseech the **True Characters of the White Emperor** [白帝真文] for **dissolution and warding**.\n\nIf the **Five Stars transgress and the Black Comet逆流** in the **northern quadrant of the Dark Tortoise’s seven mansions** [玄武七宿分野], I beseech the **True Characters of the Black Emperor** [黑帝真文] for **dissolution and warding**.\n\nIf the **Five Stars transgress and the Yellow Comet逆流** in the **central region of the Hooked Array’s Three Enclosures and the Imperial Seat of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars** [勾陈三垣帝座北斗七元星君], I beseech the **True Characters of the Yellow Emperor** [黄帝真文] for **dissolution and warding**.\n\nMay the **Emperor and Sovereign reign for ten thousand years** [帝主万年], their **lineage enduring a hundred generations** [本支百世]. May the **celestial patterns remain in order** [天文有序], and the **earthly cycles endure** [地纪常容]. May the **nation grow wealthy and families prosperous** [国富家康], the **times harmonious and the people flourishing** [时和俗阜].\n\nOnly then shall the **Dao Official and his household** [醮官某家等] find **spiritual peace and bodily ease** [神安体裕], their **fortunes extended and longevity assured** [益算延龄], their **blessings and merits renewed** [福禄维新], with **no return of misfortune** [凶衰不作], their **kinfolk thriving and their dwellings serene** [眷属亨泰，所止肃清], their **towns and villages at rest** [井邑静安], and their **regions in tranquility** [方隅宁谧].\n\nAll petitions shall be **fully granted** [悉荷保全], extending **universal protection to all living beings** [普及生灵], so that all may **equally share in divine favor** [均叨庇佑].\n\nYour servants, overwhelmed by this **final gratitude** [祈谢之至], now **bow before the Celestial Throne** [拜首天阶] and humbly present this **concluding offering**.\n\n**Reignite the incense brazier.**\n\n**Incense Officials and Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the Attendant Spirit Officials of the Incense**, now command that at the site where this **Dao Rite** [设醮] was established, **golden elixirs and jade-green herbs** [金液丹碧], **mushrooms and hundred-spirits’ blessings** [芝英百灵] shall naturally manifest.

By this merit, we honor the Heavenly Sovereign, kings and princes, all ministers and officials, the land and territorial deities, scripture masters, and those who dwell in mountains and forests, cultivating the Dao and seeking True Immortality. We also honor all fellow students, the nine degrees of kin, and all people of the world—both living and sentient beings alike.**\n\n**Now, with sincere hearts, we extend universal repentance. The undersigned and all disciples humbly submit our bodies, our spirits, and our lives to the Supreme Ten-Directional Numen, the Natural and Primordial Dao of Boundless Truth. We beseech thee to grant us forgiveness—ourselves and the officiating assembly—for all transgressions of past and present lives, freeing us from the Three Evil Paths, the Ten Sufferings and Eight Hardships, and the Nine Calamities, that we may attain the Dao’s True Essence, traverse the void, ascend to Heaven in broad daylight, and attend upon the Dao Sovereign in the Boundless Golden Threshold and the Seven-Treasured Natural Palace, forever harmonizing with the Dao.**\n\n**All petitions of Mysterious Grace are presented before the Supreme Dao of Boundless Truth.**\n**Repentance is offered.**\n**The Law’s Titles are solemnly invoked once more.**\n\n**The present officials and all others, with united sincerity, hereby present our petition.

When the Imperial Sovereign’s plan unfolded, the people’s customs were shaped by desire. The Primordial Dao divided its essence to respond to transformation, and the Divine Sacrificial Ox emerged with wisdom to awaken potential. After shifting from caves to dwellings, we raised beams and pillars. Through agriculture and cultivation, we gained the advantage of pestles and mortars; refining fur and blood, we found the utility of stoves and cauldrons. The Six Ministries were well-ordered, and the Three Hierarchies established. Thus, from the warmth of Yang and the chill of Yin, the harshness of Jia and the softness of Yi, life and death were hidden in the formless, and blessings and misfortunes concealed in the unfathomable. Only through the study of scriptures did we gradually perceive the ties of mundane existence.**\n\n**Though we are but humble grass and insignificant dust, weak in nature and lowly in origin, we have been fortunate to inherit the lingering blessings of past ages and to encounter this enlightened time. Having secured a dwelling to reside in, we now earnestly seek the Heavenly Sovereign’s gracious favor, reverently observing the fasts and rites of purification, and giving thanks to the True Spirits.**\n\n**As we have been entrusted with the office of the True Ministry and honored as leaders of the Dao, our duty is to propagate its teachings and our aspiration to establish merit. None who seek sincerity shall be left unanswered. Today, we present our heartfelt words and dare not withhold them. Our petition is now declared.**\n\n**According to our words, we solemnly vow: We shall purify our five limbs with bathing, refine our six emotions, follow the rites for averting disasters and calamities, and perform the methods for securing a tranquil abode and harmonious dwelling. We arrange the altar as prescribed, and its design mirrors Heaven. With the offerings of the officiating household—silk, brocade, and devotional tokens—we pacify the Five Directions. With incense, flowers, lamps, and candles, we affirm our sincere and earnest resolve.**\n\n**From this day forward, we establish this fast as its beginning. When the appointed time arrives and our petition is heard by the Supreme Truth, we shall pray for blessings and grace, for the peace of spirits and the resolution of offenses, all in accordance with the fast’s precepts. Previously, we have already presented our petition, and our gratitude is directed to the Supreme Three Venerables and the Ten-Directional Sacred Worthies, who deign to inspect and reflect upon our supplications. We now command the appointed inspectors, the land and territorial deities, to unite in heart, to join in strength, and to sweep away all impurities within and without. May the altar be cleansed and the path to the void be opened, that the True Saints may descend in response, granting our hearts tranquility and our spirits steadfastness. With our thoughts focused and our petitions heard, let our good deeds be fulfilled without obstruction.**\n\n**On the following bright dawn, we shall continue our Dao practice and renew our petition.**\n**Twelve Vows are hereby declared.**",

Beginning (Xuanyuan Shi)** of the **Three Essences (San Hun)**, the **Supreme Dao Lord (Taishang Daojun)**, and the **Supreme Old Lord (Taishang Laojun)**—\nCall forth from my body the **Thirty-Six Officials of the Five Agents (San Wu)**, the **Left and Right Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Incense Bearers**, the **Dragon Couriers and Mounted Attendants**, the **Golden Boys Attending Incense**, the **Jade Maidens Conveying Petitions and Scattering Flowers**, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**, and the **Direct Day Incense Officials**—each **Thirty-Six in number**—to emerge.\n\nThose who emerge are adorned in **solemn and splendid robes**,\nWith **headdresses and sashes** trailing their **pendant ribbons**.\nThe **land and domain spirits** of the **mysterious hall** are invoked,\nAnd the **divine beings** of the **Four Quarters** are summoned.\n\nNow that I ascend the **altar** to practice the **Way**,\nI humbly present this **prayer** to express my **true intent**.\nMy **sincere petitions** have already been recorded and heard—\nI pray that the **Supreme Dao’s Essence of the Ten Thousand Directions**,\nThe **precious blessings** of its **radiant light**,\nMay descend and flow into my body,\nSo that my **petitions** reach the **Supreme Boundless Dao**,\nBefore the **Heavenly Sovereign, Jade Emperor of the Supreme Heaven**.\n\nI request the

**Primordial Sovereign rules the celestial operations**,\nThe **Five Talismans** open their **teachings**,\nAnd the **Three Caverns** proclaim their **rituals**.\n\nThe **Heavenly Sovereign** bestows the **Great Compassion’s Precepts**,\nThe **Supreme Lord** spreads the **Boundless Blessings**,\nMolding all beings and rescuing all life.\nI, with **countless eons of good karma**,\nHave been blessed by the **mysterious transformations**,\nAnd through the **Dragon Scriptures** and **Phoenix Records**,\nThe **jade decrees** and **precious texts**,\nI have been able to **cultivate and refine**,\nAnd thus **ascend and attain**—\nWhile at the **beginning of my oath**, I have taken **rescue as my priority**.\n\nWhatever I may **present in supplication**,\nShall not be **left unanswered**,\nAnd since I **offer these words in accordance with the Dao’s will**,\nHow dare I **fail to submit them**?\nWith **sincere fasting intentions**,\nI shall **proclaim them faithfully**.\n\n**Proclamation of the Petition**.\n\nAs the **words are spoken**, my **sincerity is profound and my devotion fervent**.\nThe **situation calls for** the **Dao’s compassionate intervention**.\nI humbly consider that before the **Five Supreme Lords**,\nThe **Three Spirits** differentiated from the **Primordial Essence**,\nSince the **Great Antiquity**,\nThey have not mingled with the **profane and impure**.\nIn **winter’s hollows** and **summer’s nests**,\nThey **embrace the Dao** and **hold virtue**,\nEach finding their **proper place** in **mysterious unity**.\n\nFrom the **countless myriads of yin and yang**,\nThe **celestial symbols** descend upon the **foundations of the world**.\n**Good and bad fortune**, **virtue and vice**,\nDepend upon **alignment or defiance**.\nTo **follow them** brings

**altar** in its **proper form**,\nTo **divide and bestow blessings**.\n\nNow, as I **ascend the altar** to practice the **Way**,\nI request the **Law Master and assembly** to perform this **first incense offering**.\nMay this **fragrant incense** ascend to the **Supreme Dao’s Precious Heavenly Sovereign of the Ten Thousand Directions**.\n\nI and my **compatriots**,\n**Repent our bodies, repent

Residence**,\nAnd the **joy spreading to the Heavenly Descendants**.\nMay we **compare with Mount Song and Mount Heng** in **virtue**,\nAnd **align with the sun and moon** in **clarity**.\n\nThe **Prince and all the Kings**,\nShall **support and uphold the sacred work**.\nThe **virtuous ministers and loyal advisors**,\nShall **commend and assist in the planning**.\nAll **states shall ascend in order**,\nAnd all **beings shall prosper in clarity**.\n\nNow, through this **incense offering**,\nI **take refuge in the Dao’s Supreme Sovereign and the True Essence of the Saints**.\nAfter

bestowed upon my descendants**,\nThe **mercy extending to the living and the dead**,\nThe **bearing of the Dao’s rest**,\nAnd the **constant reception of Primordial Auspiciousness**.\n\nNow, through this **incense offering**,\nI **take refuge in the Scripture’s Supreme Sovereign and the True Essence of the Saints**.\nAfter **attaining the Dao**,\nI shall **ascend to the Formless**,\nAnd **harmonize with the True Essence of the Way**.\n\nNow, as I **ascend the altar** to practice the **Way**,\nI request the **Law Master and assembly** to perform this **third incense offering**.\nMay

to replace **cavernous nests**,\nTaking the **principles of the Two Poles** (yin-yang) as their model,\nAnd dividing the **five types of qi** (wuxing),\nThus setting the **positions of yin and yang**,\nAnd clarifying the **distinctions between calamity and auspiciousness**.\n\nThe **Heavenly and Earthly officials** govern their duties accordingly.\nWhen **virtue** prevails, it **prolongs

merit**,\nAnd **solely in benefiting others**.\nAll who **petition and appeal**,\nHow could we **dare not present** their cases?\n\nThe **disciple of such-and-such rank**, through the **construction

      "translated_text": "「The **Yellow Emperor** (黄帝) established the ritual rules for filial and respectful sacrifices to the **Hearth Deity** (灶君), and for ten thousand generations, none dared to neglect the **personal sacrifice** (躬之祭).\n\nWithin our household, the **highborn and lowly** (良贱之人), from dawn till dusk, engage in myriad deeds without understanding or discernment. They transgress the **divine hearth** (神灶), their worries unceasing, and in both public and private affairs, their schemes and undertakings are fraught with **entanglements and setbacks** (虑结迍邅之事). Sometimes, they invoke **misfortune and malevolent spirits** (祸横之灵), and though they offer thanks and apologies, they lack proper means. Only **fear and trepidation** (惶惧) follow.\n\nNow, we select this **auspicious day** (良日), and perform the **rites of sacrifice and offering** (礼仪) with utmost solemnity. We **invite all the deities** (众神), humbly beseeching their **mercy and compassion** (慈怜) and praying for **universal blessings** (普降).\n\nThe **sacred spirits within and without** (中外神圣) graciously accept our sincere **devotions** (虔祈). They follow the **fragrant incense** (香雾) to our **ritual fast** (斋临), their hearts inclined toward us in **favor and grace** (流贶). Their **enlightened wisdom** (圣智) shines forth, **never neglecting our earnest efforts** (靡怠情勤).\n\nYour humble servant, **unworthy of such devout prayer** (虔祷), prostrates and bows twice, presenting the **initial offering of wine** (初献). Scattered flowers.\n\nA **proclamation or invocation** (宣牒或词) is made. Now, we **burn incense again** (焚香), earnestly reiterating our **supplications to the deities above** (上启). To the **Greatest Saints of Antiquity** (太古大圣), the **Heavenly Hearth Deity and his retinue** (灶君部属), the **Heavenly Hearth Deity who presides over the Five Spirits of Hearth** (司命五灵灶君), and all **divine beings who respond to inner and outer offerings** (内外感应), and **every spirit** (一切神灵),\n\nWe **humbly reflect** that in the **prosperous Three Dynasties** (繁昌三代), the **auspicious yellow ram** (黄羊) appeared at **morning and evening** (晨昏); in **all ages, this singular moment** (万世一时), the **white house** (白屋) may be **added to daily rituals** (日用). Your **power is shared with the Fire Element** (威分火德), your **radiance aligns with the Sun’s Dao** (道合太阳). Your **name is inscribed in Heaven** (名应上天), your **virtues proclaimed to Earth** (功宣下土). There exists the **principle of transforming calamity into auspice** (变祸为祥之理), and the **demonstration of dispelling malevolent forces and warding off evil spirits** (祛魔却怪之能). Your **transformative and nurturing power** (化生熟) extends blessings to **both ancient and modern times** (古今), while your **unimpeded spiritual efficacy** (运灵通) encompasses **mercy as vast as the universe** (恩如寰海). Your **divine might is unfathomable** (神威罔测), your **wondrous efficacy boundless** (妙用无穷).\n\nYet, this humble servant, **unworthy of refined understanding** (卑凡性识), entangled in **mundane affairs** (尘俗行藏), along with our **elders, young, females, and males** (老幼女男), and **those of high and low station** (尊卑良贱), have **recklessly stirred intentions and actions** (起心运意), **offending the sacred and defying the divine** (误圣违神).\n\nAt the **commencement of building the hearth** (建灶之初), and in its **very construction** (营造之始), we **moved earth without regard to omens** (动土工而无论凶吉), **laid bricks and stones without knowing their auspiciousness** (加砖石而岂识利宜). Sometimes, the **structure was flawed** (状失规模), **mixing old and new elements** (□杂新故); sometimes, the **clay was unclean** (泥涂不洁), the **design improper** (式样乖疏). We **chose days rarely auspicious** (择日罕遇於良辰), and **offered sacrifices without following proper rites** (奉祭莫遵於轨范). The **cauldron was once used in unclean places** (釜曾经於秽所), the **ground may have been buried with the dead** (地或瘗於伏尸).\n\nAmong our **kinsmen and attendants, near and distant** (眷属亲疏), some **treated the deities lightly** (轻神), **offered insufficient rites** (薄礼). We **mistakenly prioritized great and small offerings** (大小误错), **sampling food before the sacrifice** (於未祭以先尝). Even in **gathering firewood for domestic use** (入宅樵薪), we **recklessly ventured into ancestral mounds and shrines** (宁测於丘陵社庙). In **preparing meals and cooking** (供时烧爨), we **did not heed the harm of winds and □** (焉知其风□雷伤).\n\nOur **ritual fasts were improperly conducted** (困损误修), **our Dao names violated taboos** (道名触讳). Our **cups and bowls for food** (杯盂食器) were **not made in accordance with the Hearth Deity’s standards** (罔同制於灶君); our **chickens and pigs** (鸡豚), along with **hair and feathers** (毛发), were **offered without proper reverence** (冒冲於前后).\n\nWe **did not guard against forbidden omens** (不防於忌讳) in our **soup and water**, **pouring them out or extinguishing flames**; we **did not consider the weight of offerings** (弗顾於重轻) in our **cooking and steaming**, **presenting high or low sacrifices**. We **failed to offer sacrifices at the auspicious hours of the Tiger and Rabbit** (无生於寅卯), **neglecting the proper timing for water and metal elements** (水金乏祭於时辰).\n\nNow, we **offer sincere repentance** (忏谢必伸), **begging for divine forgiveness and pardon** (乞垂赦宥).\n\nYour humble servant, **unworthy of utmost devotion** (不任精诚恳祷之至), bows twice and burns incense, presenting the **secondary offering of wine** (亚献). Scattered flowers.\n\nWe **earnestly reiterate our supplications** (谨重诚上启), to the **Greatest Saint, Hearth Deity of the Five Spirits** (司命五灵灶君), and all **seated sacred spirits** (合坐一切众圣).\n\nNow, we **devout disciples** (奉道弟子某), both **elders and juniors** (一家长少), **pour out our sincere offerings** (再倾丹赤), **collectively informing all the deities** (共告诸神).\n\nWe **humbly pray for your consideration** (乞念凡微) of our **lowly and devout reverence** (鉴其虔仰). **Benevolently open your divine creation** (俯开圣造), and **bestow extraordinary blessings** (深布殊休).\n\nThis humble servant and all our **household, young and old** (合家幼艾等), **confess our past errors and misdeeds** (从来之误作故为), **sincerely repenting and offering thanks**. For your **future grace and forgiveness** (此去之垂恩降宥), we **solemnly vow to reform** (惟卜自新).\n\nWe **pray for honor and advancement in public office** (仕公有迁达之荣), and **prosperity and flourishing in private life** (处私获昌隆之福). In **times of wind, cold, heat, and dampness** (风寒暑湿之候), may we **borrow your divine light and protection** (各假恩光). In **cooking and steaming at all times** (炊蒸动作之时), may we **especially receive your benevolent grace** (尤加善贶).\n\nMay all **transformations and nurturing be complete** (化生成熟), **all blessings and auspices depend on your divine power** (锡福储祥).

Though I possess divine transformations, I dwell among humanity.

All calamities fall under their purview, from the highest realms of state to the lowest of common folk. If one sincerely reveres them, blessings will follow. I now present the most essential teachings—pray grant them to be observed.\n\nThe **Hearth Deity** has **forty-two divine attendants**, some of whom appear on certain days, others not. If worshipped on their appointed days, blessings will come; if worshipped otherwise, misfortune will follow. Moreover, each month they consume different offerings, and their taboo names must be avoided—never to be spoken or transgressed. Now I shall detail these carefully; pray record them for the sake of humanity.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"I wish to hear their names.\"*\n\nThe Cook replied: *\"The **Hearth Deity** bears the surname **Zhang** (张), given name **Dan** (单), with his father named **Ji** (吉) and mother **Li** (利).

Furthermore, one must not sleep before the **Hearth Deity’s door**, discard unclean ashes nearby, or bathe children in their presence. Should these prohibitions be violated, one will suffer from poverty, eye ailments, or festering sores.\n\nInstead, one must daily dispose of ashes in the **Southern Homogeneous Direction** (南丙地), ensuring prosperity and avoiding the listed calamities.

My **earnest petitions** have already been recorded and conveyed. May the **Most High Dao of the Ten Directions** descend with **Divine Treasure Radiance**, flowing into my body, so that my petitions may swiftly reach the **Most High Supreme Dao of the Great Ultimate, the Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty**.\n\n**I now invoke the Law-Position** and, together with all the assembled officials, **sincerely present this petition** to:\n**The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Sovereign of the Void-Natural, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Laozi, the Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty, the Nine Sovereigns of Highest Truth, the Ten-Directional Perfected Saints, the Crowd of Supreme Truths, the Noble Masters of the Thirty-Six Departments, the Rounded Vault of Mystic Symbols—the Celestial Sovereigns of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the North Dipper Emperor, the Seven Celestial Ministers of the Five Agents, the Southern Polar Emperor, the Marshal of the Stars, the Six Celestial Officials, my Native Star, the Cavern-Heavens and Ocean-Peaks, the Three Realms’ Officials, and all Divine Spirits.**\n\nI have heard that the **Round Vault hangs its symbols**, the **waxing and waning** first governed by the **Seven Celestial Stems**; the **Luminous Patterns** shift in their courses, their rotation originating from the **Two Celestial Ministers**. The **Dipper Constellation** marks the celestial calendar, its meaning illuminated in the classics; the **Polar Star** governs the **Celestial Sovereign’s Chariot**, its **Jade Balance** establishing the moon’s course. The **Southern Dipper** resides in the **Tiger Position**; the **Northern Polar Star** truly rules from the **Central Axis**. The **Throat and Tongue** transmute the cosmos, their authority extending to **calendar and symbol**. The **Three Hundred Sixty-Five Degrees** uphold the **Celestial Temple’s guiding principles**; the **Ten Thousand Plus Stars** all submit to the **Dipper’s Ladle’s command**. The **Four Seasons** are regulated by the **Jade Candle**, the **Three Celestial Stems** respond to the **Bronze Instrument**—all governed by the **Two Poles**, assisting the **One Ultimate’s motion**.\n\nAll who dwell within mortal bounds **draw their essence from the Heavenly Pattern**. Though their ranks differ, their **principles converge in unity**.\n\nI, **Dao-Practitioner [Name]**, though granted the **imperial mandate’s destiny** and endowed with **jewel-like purity**, am born of **water and fire’s fundamental nature**, the **Southern and Northern Dipper’s divine descent**. Though I wield the **four elemental forms**, I cultivate the **One True Root**. How dare I not **revere the Mystic**, striving to **return to the Origin**?\n\nI establish the **Platform as the Dipper’s likeness**, encircling the **Imperial Seat with radiant light**; I offer **water and flowers**, gazing toward the **Celestial Pivot’s axis** with unwavering faith. The **rites follow the Secret Edicts**, the **solemn observances adhere to the unique laws**. With reverence for the **nearby威 (awe)**, I dare to **threefold prostrate my petitions**.\n\nI dwell in the **Secret Hall**, ascending the **True Stages**. Though I follow the **Celestial Steps’ order**, I am unworthy of **Pengzi’s daughter’s ascension**; though I **light the lamp for the Dipper**, I lack **Deng De’s sincerity in subduing rebellion**. Yet, if I **proclaim the Mystic Teachings**, perhaps **auspicious blessings** may descend upon the virtuous.\n\nHaving received these **earnest words**, I dare not withhold them. **The Petition is Proclaimed.**\n\nAs the words declare, **my sincerity is profound and urgent**. May my offering ascend to the **Imperial Presence**, permeating the **Celestial Platform**.\n\nThe **Shared Governance** is just, the **Assisting Sovereigns** are impartial. **Life’s sustenance** is equally bestowed; **daily needs** are mutually dependent. Though the **Treasure-Sword** lies hidden, its light still shines in its sheath; though the **Abundant Fox** is of strange kind, it still extends its reverence to the **Dipper’s Ladle**. Since I possess the **most refined essence**, I must recognize **the Origin of All Life**.\n\nThe **True Body of the Dao** manifests through the **transformations of water and fire**; the **Heavenly Form** is ever-changing in the **celestial courses**. Thus, I **conduct the Conjunction Rites on this unified platform**, solemnly revering the **Supreme Celestial’s brilliance**.\n\nThe **lofty Heavenly Beam** spans the **Yellow River’s source**, its pillars interlocked; the **resplendent Jade Dipper** rotates with the **Dragon’s Ladle and Horn**, its motion ever-leftward. I **fix my thoughts on the high vault**, my spirit **soaring through the Mystic Symbols**, wishing to **descend upon the winds and clouds**, humbly casting aside past shame.\n\nMay all who pass be **transformed**, all who remain be **deified**—**bringing blessings to family and nation**. May **flourishing prosperity** bring **longevity and joy**, extending **blessings to both the visible and unseen**.\n\nWith **fragrant incense rising**, I **attain the boundless grace**. Now, as I perform the **Midday Dao Practice**, I request that the **Law-Assembled** kindle the **first incense strand**. May this **smoke ascend directly to the heavens**, offering **sustenance to the Most High Three Sovereigns and the Ten-Directional Saints**.\n\nI, along with all present, **submit my body, my spirit, my fate**—\nWith these **merits and virtues**, I **pray for the current Emperor**.\n\nMay **clarity and brilliance** shine together, the **Celestial Pivot and Polar Star** align in harmony.\nMay **forms and symbols** be perfected, surpassing even my own body in reverence;\nFrom **south to north**, may all be **molded by the Dao’s transformations**.\n\nMay the **Heavenly Steps** be unobstructed, **human culture** flourish eternally.\nThe **principles** gleam like the **order of stars**; the **land endures as Heaven does**.\n**Grain and rice** abound like **water and fire**; the **seasons are harmonious, the years bountiful**.\n\nNow, as I **burn this incense**, I **take refuge in the Dao’s Perfected Saints and Supreme Truths**.\nAfter attaining the **Dao**, I shall **ascend to the Formless**, **harmonizing with the True Dao**.",

      "translated_text": "**The *Comprehensive Daoist Ritual Precepts Collection* – Master Guangtong Du’s Revised *North Dipper Prolonging Life Pure Ritual Rites***\n\n**On Establishing the Ritual Platform**\n\nShould one who serves the **Supreme Celestial** (上真) fail to align with the **Heavenly Symbols and Earthly Patterns** (法天象地), constructing the platform according to the **Dipper’s Ladle** (随斗杓而建坛), they violate the **Dao’s Teachings** (违道训). It is better not to perform the rites at all than to proceed thus. The ritualist must first purify their **inner realm** (内境), clarifying their **spirit and vital essence** (召魂集神), so that the **Ten Thousand Things** respond to their command and transform in accordance with their will. Only then can their sincerity be manifest—otherwise, though offerings may be abundant, they will yield no benefit. Thus, **invoking the incense** (祝香) must come first.\n\nNext, one must **recite the ritual precepts and teachings** (叙陈科教), for without this, the **Daoist and layfolk** will lack proper cause and effect, and their **faith will wane**, making it difficult for the **Celestial Worthies** to descend. Thus, **reciting the ritual’s purpose** follows.\n\nOnce the purpose is declared, if one cannot **describe the celestial patterns** (纪述天文) and **proclaim the Primordial Mystery** (对扬元妙), they will fail to honor the **Dipper’s Sovereignty** (北斗之尊). Thus, **narrating the Worthies’ virtues** comes next.\n\nAfter recounting the Worthies’ virtues, if no **sincere words** are spoken, sincerity cannot stand. Thus, **proclaiming the invocation** follows.\n\nYet even then, if one’s **petitions for blessings and averting of calamities** are not made with **practiced Dao and vowed aspirations**, placing others before oneself, they cannot align with the **Celestial Intent**. Thus, **offering the three incense** follows.\n\nOnce the incense is offered, one’s **past karmic burdens and grave offenses** must be **repented**. The **Mysterious Virtues and Marvelous Benevolence** must be **striven for**. Without this, sins will not be extinguished, and blessings will not descend. Thus, **repentance** follows.\n\nAfter repentance, one must **contemplate the Seven Celestial Worthies’ Virtues** (七元之德), holding them in mind as if they were present, so that their **auspicious aid may be secured**. Thus, **praising their virtues** follows.\n\nOnce the virtues are praised, one must **take refuge**, exhausting their **sincere aspirations**, so that the **Divine Presence may surely accept them**. Thus, **the Seven Refuges** follow.\n\nAfter taking refuge, one may **offer the coarse wine** (浊醪) as a ritual expression of the heart. Thus, **the three libations** follow.\n\nOnce the libations are complete, the **ritual decorum is fulfilled**, the **gracious blessings obtained**, and the **words of thanksgiving** must be spoken to **send the Worthies back to the void**, while **gazing upward in reverence**. Nothing further can be added, so the **dismissal of the platform** concludes the rites—**a single phrase suffices**.\n\n---\n**The Invocation of Incense**\n\n*\"Dao Incense, Virtue Incense, the Incense of Effortless Naturalness*—now burning in the heated censer—**I summon the Three Treasures of the Great Luo, the Jade Seal Celestial Sovereigns, the Golden Gate Jade Emperor, the Central Heavenly Star Sovereign of Purple Micro, the Native Star Sovereign of the Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper, and all the Celestial Worthies of the Encompassing Heavenly River and Constellations.**\n\nWith this **true incense**, I **universally offer reverent homage**.\n\nI, **your humble disciple of the [Surname] household**, now **proclaim the ritual precepts and practice the Dao**, petitioning for blessings and averting calamities. First, I shall **recite the ritual’s chapters and extol the virtues**, so that within this **ritual platform**, both **Daoists and layfolk** may witness and hear, and all generate **reverent devotion**.\n\nI **humbly pray for celestial favor**, seeking even a slight alignment with the **Heavenly Will**. It is proper to **lay this out in detail**; I pray you **deign to inspect it with favor**.\n\nI have heard that the **Most High established Virtue**, setting forth the **lofty winds of purity and stillness**; the next was to **establish Teachings**, expounding the **marvelous scriptures of compassion**.\n\nThey compiled the **Daoist canons**, hiding them in **sacred mountains**, sometimes revealing their traces to **deliver beings**, or bestowing **ritual precepts to save the world**.\n\nThey **detailed the cycles of the Lower Primordial** and **expounded the causes of one’s native star**, opening the way for all people to **take refuge in the Great Dao**, so that they might **cultivate the heart and nourish the qi**, confess sins to **prolong life**, and at the **times when Celestial Worthies descend**, always **grant sincere prayers**.\n\nAt the **Three Primordial Festivals and Eight Seasonal Nodes**, at one’s **native star’s birth hour**, they **solemnly established the ritual platform**, **reverently observing fasts and pure rites**, whether in **temple halls or domestic settings**.\n\nThey held **various incense and flowers**, offering them with **sincere devotion**; they arranged **fragrant wines and fruits**, their **virtues shining bright**. They **modeled the rites after Heaven and Earth**, **embodying the decorum of awe** in their offerings.\n\nWhen observing fasts, they **extended from one day to seven**, according to their **capacity to perform merit**; when commissioning the Dao, they **gathered from one person to seven**, inviting them to **conduct the rites**.\n\nSome **recited the numinous spells**, others **acknowledged the true forms**, directing their hearts to the **Dipper’s Sovereignty**, bowing beneath the **Purple Micro**, **humbling themselves before the Three Officials and Five Emperors**, **reaching sincerity to the Nine Palaces and Four Departments**, **offering blessings to prolong life**, **dissipating calamities and warding off misfortune**, **broadening boundless blessings**, and **receiving the greatest of celestial favor**. They **pondered the True Worthies’ unerring will**, **avoided false sects**, **purified the decay of calamities**, **shared in the dissolution of sins**, **attained virtuous fruits for the body**, and **secured blessings and longevity for life**, **ascending to the Ten Extremes**, **never sinking into the Three Abysses**. All this is the **power of invocation**, none other than the **support of the Worthies’ virtues**.\n\nYet there are those of the **Lower Primordial** born into lands afflicted by **epidemic scourges**, where **plagues spread**; or years struck by **famine and scarcity**, where **harvests fail and goods are not produced.**\"",

Many face the specter of famine and hunger, while lands are ravaged by blade and war.\n\nIn reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, expressing mortal sincerity and chanting divine incantations—thus summoning the **Thunderous Spirit’s** might to the earth. We deploy **celestial chariots** across the four quarters, cast nets a thousandfold, and unleash **flaming arrows** ten thousand *li* far. We gather the **five demonic weapons’** malevolent *qi* and ensure the **five grains** flourish in harmony. The year shall rejoice in abundance, and the people shall know no untimely death.\n\nYet there are those of the **Lower Primordial** afflicted by sudden calamities, where pestilence and miasma cannot be evaded, and they often encounter the **Six Cavern Demons**, suffering countless torments. Their homes are plagued by misfortune, and they know no rest. Disaster and decay lurk, seizing them at their most vulnerable. Their vital breath is bound, and chronic illness ensnares them for long. Some wander in hardship, others are choked by debt. Their fortunes show signs of decline, their lives lack smooth prosperity—calamities multiply beyond description.\n\nIn reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, presenting our mortal pleas and chanting divine incantations—thus augmenting **divine insight** and **fate’s calculations**, trimming death’s register while extending life’s. Demonic scourges are dispersed, and all undertakings bring auspicious fortune.\n\nYet there are those of the **Lower Primordial** whose fields are ravaged by **locusts and borers**, whose lands teem with **plague insects**, destroying crops and leaving no harvest. Though they yearn for abundance, they reap nothing.\n\nIn reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, solemnizing the fields with ritual purity and arraying the **threatening implements** in order. Following the **science**, we recite the incantations and dispatch petitions to the heavens—thus invoking the **Thunderous Spirit’s** stern command to slay the **disaster insects**, nurturing the **grains** to double their yield.\n\nYet there are those of the **Lower Primordial** who pray for descendants at their gates, whose women bear the joy of pregnancy. Some suffer within the **Six Hexagrams**, their fetal *qi* damaged; others perish within the **Ten Years**, their lives cut short. On the critical day of their pregnancy, they encounter the **Demoness’s** calamity, harboring malevolent *qi* that cannot be preserved, consuming the **essence of life** without securing it. They suffer from **withering yellow sickness** and are plagued by **strange dreams**—cats, mice, dogs, and monkeys transform into ominous forms, secretly devouring their offspring, leading to frequent deaths and deepening the sorrow of their parents, severing the lineage of their ancestors.\n\nIn reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, expressing mortal sincerity and chanting divine incantations—thus moving the **Thunderous Spirit** of the upper realms to descend as the **Jade Maiden**, guarding the inner chambers and harmonizing the **five viscera**, ensuring the **auspiciousness of childbirth** and the **longevity of life**.\n\nYet there are women who labor in childbirth with agonizing pain, their suffering caused by the **Ghost Mother’s** devouring, weakening their **blood and viscera**, obstructing them for over a decade in endless terror.\n\nIn reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, performing the **Way** with utmost sincerity and reciting the incantations—thus summoning the **Spirit Boy** to descend alongside the **Jade Maiden**, safeguarding the **grass mat** of childbirth in peace and ensuring swift, smooth deliveries for both mother and child.\n\nYet there are women who, as **tiger-wolf consorts**, consume the **essence of their children’s viscera**, desperately seeking sons yet bearing none in their lifetimes.\n\nIn reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, purifying the hall with solemnity and offering **incense and flowers** in abundance, focusing our hearts on **single virtue** and reciting the incantations ten thousand times—thus sweeping away demons and banishing evil, ensuring **abundant progeny**.\n\nAll these **divine responses** are recorded in the **Precious Scrolls**. Thus it is known that the **Nuns’** atonements and the **Seven Primordials’** salvation encompass all.\n\nThis is the **Most High’s** expedient means, the **Most Holy’s** compassionate mercy, their **sincere devotion** for the people and **wholehearted benevolence** for all things. If one purifies the heart with fasting, presents humble pleas, prepares the rites with meticulous words, and invokes their wishes—what desire shall not be fulfilled, what petition shall not be granted?\n\nNow, I, **[Name Redacted]**, pondering deeply and reflecting earnestly, bathe in **virtue** and purify my body, dedicating my intent to the **True Science** and aligning my heart with the **Mysterious Way**. I establish this **altar platform**, modeling it after the **vault of heaven**, adjusting the **celestial measurements**, lighting the **lamp of the Dipper**, reverently presenting the **law of faith**, and solemnly preparing **incense and flowers**, inviting the **Celestial Drivers** to descend and witness the **mortal’s** sincere prayers.\n\nWith deepest reverence, I now set forth this **preliminary exposition**, expounding the **True Function**, declaring it to all officials, that they may follow the **law’s instruction**, examine their intentions, and redouble their diligence. May this move the **Thunderous Spirit**, accomplish the **merit**, and then proceed according to the **rites**, continuing with the **petitions**.\n\nWe, the mortals, are overwhelmed with awe at the **Dao’s power**, the **divine light’s** descent, the **spirit’s** soaring brilliance, and the **urgent, protective** grace.\n\n*[End of Volume Fifty-Five]*\n*[Beginning of Volume Fifty-Six]*\n*Dao Gate Ritual Standards Complete Collection*",

remain unmeasured.\n\nWhere sincerity is directed, the response is boundless.\nThus, the **Spiritual Officials** are capable of conveying petitions.\nWe dare to offer the **fragrance of a single incense burner**,\nAnd humbly invite the **Four Celestial Rectifiers’** sacred might.\n\nWe hope to be granted **spiritual communion**,\nAnd that **inspection and approval** may soon descend.\nNow with this incense, we solemnly summon\nThe **Year-Rectifier Functionaries**,\nThe **Month-Rectifier Functionaries**,\nThe **Day-Rectifier Functionaries**,\nAnd the **Hour-Rectifier Functionaries**,\nOnly wishing for their descent to receive our humble entreaties.\n\nWe, the disciples, reverently acknowledge:\nThe **Four Celestial Rectifiers** are the most **exalted and supreme** among all directions;\nThey traverse **ten thousand li** without pause,\nNor do they linger for an instant.\n\nBy **jade gates and golden courts**, their commands are transmitted,\nAnd they oversee the **knocking at the threshold**;\nWith **cloud chariots and wind steeds**, they pass through the capital,\nAs dense as **journeying through the celestial realms**.\n\nWe rely on the **Holy Power’s** swift conveyance,\nTo reach the **Divine Hearing’s** fourfold expanse.\nIf our prayers are **precise and clear**,\nThey shall never face obstruction or delay.\n\nNow, this **Dao Ritual Official** of humble virtue,\nFrom birth endowed with **auspicious connections**,\nHas encountered the **True Dao**,\nAnd with **morning and evening incense**, dares not forget the **True Sage’s** boundless grace;\nWith **seasonal offerings and reverent devotion**, seeks to align with the **Spiritual Officials’** swift descent.\n\nWe humbly pray that the **Divine Presence** may descend to inspect,\nAnd that all who dwell in this age may witness\n**Auspicious mists ascending to the heavens**,\n**Blessed winds and rains upon the earth**,\n**Jade scripts unfolding on emerald tablets**,\n**Sacred sincerity emanating from crimson hearts**,\nTo rely on the **preceding entreaties**,\nAnd achieve **harmonious ascent**,\nThat our prayers and petitions may be **granted and heard**.\n\n**Issue the

deepest contemplations may not reach above,\nWe **invite the descent** on this **auspicious day**,\nDaring to disturb the **Highest Spirit’s** hearing.\n\nWe humbly pray that the **Rectifiers** may **convey our words**,\nThat our **endeavors may succeed**,\nOur **petitions be fulfilled**,\nOur **exorcisms repel evil**,\nOur **actions bear fruit**,\nAnd that this **modest sincerity** may not be in vain.\n\n**Recite the Precepts.**\n\nWe reverently acknowledge:\nThe **True Martial Spirit of the North**—**Lord of Sacred Response**—\nIs the **manifest form of the Highest Venerable Lord**,\nAssociated with the **Sixth Star of the Northern Dipper**, **Mars**,\nWho governs **Military Conquest**.\n\nIn the North, the **constellations of Xu (虚)** and **Wei (危)** are likened to **serpents**,\nAnd the **stars of Yingshi (营室)** and **Dongbi (东壁)** to **tortoises**.\nThe **tortoise** bears a shell to **defend itself**,\nThe **serpent** forms an array with **head and tail both present**,\nThus embodying the **symbol of martial prowess**.\nWhen the **tortoise and serpent unite**, they become the **True Martial Spirit**,\nWith **Divine Sovereignty**—this is the **True Lord in Heaven**.\n\nHe wears the **Azure Jade Crown**,\nAnd robes of **dark hues**,\nTogether with **Tiānpéng (天蓬)**, **Tiānyòu (天猷)**, and **Yìshèng (翊圣)**,\nKnown as the **Four Celestial Saints of the Northern Pole**.\n\nDescending to the **human realm**,\nHe **loosens his hair and goes barefoot**,\nWields a **sword to sever heresy**,\nAnd commands the **Six Ding (六丁)** and **Twelve Jade Maidens (玉女)**,\nThe **Eight Killing Generals (八杀将军)**,\nThe **Six Celestial Guardians (六甲直符)**,\nThe **Twelve Divine Generals (十二神将)**,\nEach with **twelve attendants**,\nAnd **clerks bearing talismans**, numbering **one hundred and twenty**,\nWith **divine soldiers**, **five hundred million strong**,\nAnd the **deities of thunder, lightning, wind, and rain**,\nWho always accompany him.\n\nThe **True Lord** often descends in **Sichuan**,\nAs **Sichuan** has the **County of Mysterious Tortoise** (玄武县).\nNow, to avoid the **Sacred Ancestor’s** name,\nIt is renamed **Zhōngwāng (中汪)**.\nFrom the **Han** to the **Sui**, it was under **Chéngdū (成都)**.\nIn the **third year of Emperor Wǔdé’s reign (武德三年)** of the **Tang**,\nIt was divided and placed under **Zǐzhōu (梓州)**.\nThe county boasts the **most sacred traces of the True Lord**,\nLeaning against **high mountains**.\nThe **mountains above and below** all have **temples**,\nFacing the **great river**.\nThe **river’s stones** naturally form the **shape of tortoises and serpents**.\n\nIn recent times, there were **no Daoists maintaining the temples**,\nSo it became the **Golden Immortal Daoist Hall (金仙道场)**,\nAnd the **sacred might** still frequently **manifests**,\nEven descending with **divine messages** to **Chéngdū**.\nAt the **beginning of the Song dynasty’s rise**,\nThere was a **Li surnamed Jiāohuī (燂灰李)** in **Chéngdū**,\nWho established a **single incense burner** to worship the **True Lord’s** sacred fire.\nThe **True Lord descended** to his household,\nAnd bestowed upon him **five measures of sacred

May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the Palace of Supreme Clarity, nourishing the manifested body of the Venerable and Responsive True Martial Sage, the Golden Gate Lord Lao, and the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor of the Highest Sovereignty.\n\nI humbly pray that the Great Dao may descend its benevolence in splendor, crowning the ranks of the Perfected with its auspicious grace, so that frontier beacons may shine brightly, blades may fall silent, and in court there be no ministers who deceive the sovereign or betray the state, while throughout the lands officials may govern with love for the people and loyalty to the realm. May there be no more bandits or rebellions, and may all enjoy the peace of *Shengping*.\n\nNow, having offered this incense, I take refuge in the Virtue of the Great Sage, the Perfected Assembly of the Most True. After attaining the Dao, I shall ascend to the Formless and harmonize with the True and the Way.\n\nAt this pure dawn of the Dao’s practice, I respectfully invite the assembly of the Law to take these next two strands of incense and offer them upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the Northern Pole Bureau of Eternal Rites, nourishing the Venerable and Responsive True Martial Sage’s subordinate, the Star Lord of the Martial Chord, and the assembly of the Northern Pole Saints.\n\nI humbly pray that you manifest your wondrous responses to spread far and wide, shining your sacred radiance afar, so that the officiant, this humble one’s ninth-generation ancestor seven generations back, may not be delayed at the nether gates. May my living father, now departed, be freed from all guilt. May the burdens of past-life enmity be severed, and the cries of ancestral lawsuits in the underworld be silenced. May the spirits of malevolent demons be bound, and the ghosts of the Six Peaks be beheaded. May the vast *Hongfan* qi be restored, and this people be eternally protected.\n\nNow, having offered this incense, I take refuge in the Virtue of the Great Sage, the Perfected Assembly of the Most True. After attaining the Dao, I shall ascend to the Formless and harmonize with the True and the Way.\n\nAt this pure dawn of the Dao’s practice, I respectfully invite the assembly of the Law to take these final three strands of incense and offer them upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the Divine Seat, nourishing the Venerable and Responsive True Martial Sage.\n\nI humbly pray that you embody the Golden Gate’s resplendent might, serving as the primordial minister of the Jade Capital, patrolling with decisive authority, cutting off all inauspicious omens, so that the officiant, this humble one of the *Kan* mansion, may be freed from perilous calamities and endowed with the enlightened nature of Water’s virtue. May he, who has long studied the Cloud Research Scriptures with profound mastery and unmatched eloquence, swiftly ascend to the honors of officialdom, then stride upon the lofty path of prosperity. May he who lacks such study possess a firm Daoist root and a keen, luminous nature, so that in all his comings and goings, no external evils may cling to him, and in his rest and nourishment, no temporal illnesses may afflict him. May disasters melt away like ice, and blessings grow ever longer as the sun. May he who holds office flourish in his career, distinguished by his lofty virtue, swiftly receiving the honor of promotion to perilous posts, ascending to the favor of the exalted, so that the seas may look to his statesmanship and all officials may revere his weighty bearing.\n\nNow, having offered this incense, I take refuge in the Virtue of the Teacher-Sage, the Perfected Assembly of the Most True. After attaining the Dao, I shall ascend to the Formless and harmonize with the True and the Way.\n\nWith renewed reverence, the humble official, this one, along with the assembled officiants, sincerely presents this petition to the Supreme Without Extremes, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Jade Emperor of the Highest Sovereignty, the Nine Sovereigns, the Ten Directions Without Extremes, the Supreme Spirit-Treasury Heavenly Venerable, the Perfected Saints who have attained the Dao, the Assembly of the Most True, all Revered Lords and Masters, the Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures and the Mystic Great Master of the Central Dao, the Northern Pole Auxiliary Saint, the Venerable and Responsive True Martial Sage, the Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits, and all True Essences.\n\nI have heard that the mist of the Immortals drifts through the layered stages, granting those of worthy virtue the chariot of timely ascent; that the sacred grounds are opened with pure offerings, where the solemn rites are arranged in strict order. I have exhausted my humble devotion, relying on the divine presence to scrutinize me.\n\nYet, reflecting deeply, this humble officiant’s grasp of the Dao is shallow, his birth fraught with hardship, and he has recklessly burdened the workings of Transformation without benefiting the enlightened age. Navigating the world’s paths, he has endured countless perils, his name obscured by dust. He has always feared becoming one who toils diligently at the start but grows slack at the end, or who walks the world with many faults and few merits, or whose lifespan is not long, or whose foundation is not deep.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when the Supreme One expounds the Scriptures, and on the third day of the third month, when the Venerable Sage descends, my rites of offering have been deficient, and I have truly fallen into dread. In the years *Jiazi* and *Gengshen*, my prayers were sparse; to the Seven Elements and Four Saints, my reverence was delayed. I have dwelled in filth as my norm, partaken of meat and spice without restraint, approached the dying and the dead, and followed worldly customs, observing evil winds. Some have sought fleeting honors, indulging recklessly and bringing ruin upon their ancestors; others, relying on a single family’s wealth, have grown arrogant and licentious, incurring guilt before the underworld officials. There have been those who, without law, coveted wealth, or who, violating the Dao, sought advancement through improper means.\n\nAll these transgressions I now abandon, hoping to restore the divine favor. I humbly pray that you condescend to examine my sincerity, broadly extending the shelter of the Dao, so that this officiant’s household may flourish, with blessings and longevity ever increasing, his descendants multiplying and thriving, his spouse and he aging together in harmony, his granaries ever full and his gold and silk ever abundant. May he forever dispel unforeseen disasters and eternally preserve boundless life.\n\nThis disciple, this humble official, reflects once more: righteousness and heresy cannot coexist, and good and evil cannot walk together. Because the teachings of virtue have declined in the age, the ghosts of night have grown rampant. Those who revere the Dao are few, while those who believe in heresy are many. Due to the greed of the common folk, desiring sudden wealth for their households, they fawn upon wasteful spirits, plundering their neighbors, gorging on blood in their starving bellies, and displaying monstrous transformations in the night. Some hurl tiles and stones from emptiness, while others, taking advantage of the dark, steal wealth. Some mock the spirits of the dead, and often the deceitful nature of ghosts is exposed.",

have heard that the **Great Ultimate** first divided,\nAnd the **Two Qi** established the hierarchy of **Emperors and Deities**.\nThe **Primordial Essence** having been apportioned,\nThe **Five Agents** promulgated the methods of transformation.\nThough the rise and fall are endless,\nThe **Root Source** remains inherently true.\nDwelling in **Kan**, it returns to the **Root and Command**,\nIn **Gèn**, it aids the **Beginning and End**.\n\nThus, **Yang** must arise from the **Yin**,\nAnd the **Emperor** first manifests in the **Zhen** position.\nDrawing from the **Heaven’s

**Palaces** with my singular preeminence;\nThe **Supreme Dao of the Boundless Extremes** and the **True Martial Spirit** stand as twin supports,\nSurrounding and augmenting the **illustrious

pervades and corrupts.\nIt has both **cut short the vitality of living beings**\nAnd **obscured and deceived the Heavenly Observation**.\nThe cries of the wronged reach the heavens,\nThe **Heavenly Sovereign’s** compassion responds with pity.\nThe **miraculous Dao/Way** is invoked and revealed,\nThe **attendant spirits** hasten to summon.\n\nThe **wind** moves, the **thunder** shakes—\nThe **courageous and mighty** are proclaimed;\nThe **lightning** sweeps, the **clouds** dissipate—\nAll **demonic and malevolent** are eradicated.\n\nThus, all beings are now rescued and protected.\nThe

offering.\n\n**Recite the Invocation**.\n\nAs per the **formal invocation**,\nAll sincerity is fully displayed.\n\nWe humbly invoke the **Sovereign’s virtue/power**, majestic and towering,\nPressing down upon the **near attendants of the Purple Micro**;\nThe **spirit’s prowess** is swift and keen,\nProclaiming the **Jade Emperor’s** mighty **aura**.\n\nThough you bestow **commandments upon the Northern Pole**,\nYour **Heavenly Observations** extend across the **Nine Realms**.\nYour **essence** is stored in the **Water virtue/power**,\nYour **position** is anchored in the **Stellar Stream**.\n\nYour **movements** are unrestrained,\nResponding to human hearts like an echo;\nYour **clarity and wisdom** never falter,\nPunishing **demonic beings** without fail.\n\nThis is where my

      "translated_text": "**In humble reverence, we behold Your boundless mercy, Your all-pervading and enlightening gaze.\n\nWe, Your servants, have heard that the Primordial Ancestor of the Eon *(元始祖劫)* is a name too lofty to be fully articulated; the Void of Naturalness *(虚无自然)* is the realm where the Soaring Mysteries *(飞玄)* unfold and manifest. You give birth to Heaven and Earth, forming their shapes and essences. From the extreme convergence of **Qi** *(一气之极)*, all things flow and are harmoniously complete *(流通，万物之得咸备)*.\n\nAmong all beings, humans alone are deemed most noble and must possess a fundamental root *(根元)*; the **Dao** *(道)* originates from this very source, and thus we recognize the Primordial Ancestor *(祖始)*.\n\nSince the dawn of creation *(开辟)*, we have been ensnared in the cycle of birth and death *(缠生死之缘)*. We know the suffering of transmigration *(轮回之苦)* yet remain trapped within it; we grasp the true nature of life and death *(性命之真)* yet fail to fully embody its purity. In vain, we have studied the scriptures, worn the precepts, expounded teachings, and proclaimed doctrines, seeking the root of the Supreme Primordial *(太上希夷之根)* and exploring the origin of the mixed formation of existence *(有物混成之始)*. May those who now understand the **Dao** and their true bodies *(知道知身者)* swiftly return to their pristine and unadulterated essence *(还纯返素)*; may those who refine spirit and **Qi** *(炼神炼气者)* quickly transcend the realm of existence and enter the Void *(出有入无)*.\n\nIn the past, we once vowed to uphold the transmitted teachings, striving to broaden our understanding and enlightenment. Now, as we humbly submit and offer gratitude, our earnest intentions may be fulfilled. Our disciples’ words are sincere; we shall diligently proclaim them.\n\n**Proclamation of Words.** With meticulous care, we scrutinize our language, and our hearts’ sincerity is manifest. Our fervent resolve has been fully expressed; the purity of our intent does not wane. We reverently observe the prohibitions and precepts, meticulously follow the canonical rituals *(典彝)*, establish the altar with solemnity *(肃严)*, and gaze toward the vault of Heaven *(穹窿)* as we earnestly petition.\n\nMay our steadfast single thread of devotion *(一缕之念)* ascend to the Supreme Truth of the Ten Extremes *(十极之真)*. We realize that our primordial **Qi** *(元炁)* is obscured through countless rebirths, and our harmonious essence *(冲和)* is scattered among all things. We cling to worldly attachments *(世缘)* without cultivating the **Dao** above, ensnared by habits of love *(爱习)* and unable to return to the Mysterious Root *(玄根)*. Without true sincerity, how can we hope for universal enlightenment?\n\nLet us now abandon all past impurities in a single purification, and from this very day, we shall earnestly renew our practice. We, Your servants, shall solemnly bathe our five bodies *(五体)*, refine our six emotions *(六情)*, align ourselves with the Earth yet mirror Heaven *(法地象天)*, and carry incense with unwavering faith *(赍香奉信)*. With this day and hour, we open the altar, adhering to ritual propriety *(依仪行事)*.\n\nOn the appointed day and hour *(至某日某时)*, we shall invite the descent of the Supreme Truths *(延降上真)*, offer thanks and repentance *(谢过忏愆)*, and beseech blessings and divine commands *(祈恩请命)*. In accordance with the prescribed rites *(科法)*, we shall report this in advance *(宿以启闻)*.\n\nMay the blessings of the Supreme Primordial Three *(太上三清)*, the Ten-Directional Supreme Saints *(十方上圣)*, descend upon us with mercy and illumination. May they oversee and inspect our humble petitions, and command the Spirited Officials of the **Lingbao** *(灵宝官属)*, the True Officials of the Land *(土地真官)*, to unite in heart, combine their strength, and protect us—cleansing and purifying the altar within and without, subduing demons and malevolent spirits *(降伏妖魔)*, extinguishing all evil influences *(诚灭邪祟)*—so that our minds may be at peace and our spirits steadfast. May our sincere thoughts be immediately answered, and our petitions swiftly conveyed to the Celestial Sovereign. May our virtuous deeds be accomplished without obstruction, and our wishes fulfilled as we desire. Without hindrance, our aspirations shall be realized.\n\nThough we wear the badge of the Supreme Truth *(佩正真)*, study the Great Law *(参修大法)*, dwell within the Five Turbidities *(处身五浊)*, and bear the stains of the Six Dusts *(染迹六尘)*, our Three Passes *(三关)* remain unaligned, and our Six Emotions *(六情)* are unrestrained. We rely solely on the prohibitions and precepts to restrain our bodies and minds *(捡身心)*.\n\nThen, may the Supreme Truths descend upon us, guiding and welcoming the radiant blessings *(导迎景贶)*. At dawn, we shall perform the **Dao** *(明晨行道)*, and continue the rites as we report *(续更以闻)*. Respectfully proclaimed.\n\n**Twelve Vows.** Restoring the Furnace. We earnestly summon the Incense Officials and Messengers *(香官使者)*, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Officials *(左右龙虎君)*, and the attendant Spirited Officials of the Incense *(侍香诸灵官)*. May they command that at the place where we formerly solemnly invoked and walked the **Dao** *(臣向来肃启行道之所)*, there shall naturally arise the Golden Elixir and Azure Jade *(金液丹碧)*, the Hundred Spirited Herbs and Blossoms *(芝英百灵)*, and the gathering of all True Ones *(众真交会)*, right here before this Incense Furnace.\n\nMay it be our vow that the Celestial Youth and Jade Maidens of the Ten Directions *(十方仙童玉女)* attend and receive the incense smoke, swiftly transmitting our sincere invocation *(所启之诚)* to the Supreme Primordial, the Boundless Great **Dao** *(至真无极大道)*, and the Celestial Jade Emperor’s august presence *(昊天玉皇上帝御前)*.\n\n**Eulogy Upon Exiting the Hall.** Exiting the Hall, we chant.

benevolent rule,\nHearing the people’s devotion and return.\n\nThus, we may bear the breath of purity,\nAnd aid the Sage’s bright and virtuous way.\n\nYet, lingering in idle life, content with fleeting ease,\nWe lack the embrace of the Dao or cultivation of virtue to transform others,\nFailing to restore the ancient simplicity or return to the uncarved,\nAdorning worldly rites and seeking fame in mortal affairs,\nEmptyly claiming the nation’s grace,\nAnd presumptuously standing among the Daoist ranks.\n\nOur names are not inscribed in the Southern Celestial Register,\nAnd the Yin Mountains record our countless transgressions.\n\nOnly the Sage sits facing south to govern,\nOnly the nation’s great virtue commands Heaven’s mandate.\nHaving invoked the decree from the boundless

Immortals*\nThis ritual employs the **Yellow Arrow** (黄箓) to cultivate the True Dao of the Ten Precepts (十戒),\nand the **Hosted Initiation** (明真宿启) to perform the rites—\nthe ancient rites of the Five Refining (五炼) for generating the sacred body (生尸).\n\nThe **Hosted Initiation** (宿启) is thus the means\nto invoke the souls of those who have been **transcended and drawn forth** (迁拔),\nor **extinguished and liberated** (灭度).\n\nMaster Wanfu (万福天师) composed *The Ritual for Fellow Dao Seekers* (《同学行道仪》),\nwhich mandates that from the onset of suffering to the final passing,\none must **confess and repent** (忏谢),\n**rescue and draw forth** (救拔),\n**alleviate calamities** (解灾),\nand **regret past transgressions** (悔过).\n\nIndeed, to **cultivate the Dao and ascend as an immortal** (修道升仙),\none must not rely on oneself alone—**a master is required to guide** (非师不度);\nto **transcend the mundane and attain sainthood** (超凡证圣),\none must not act alone—**a fellow Dao seeker is essential** (非友不成).\n\nA master is like **parental figures** (父母),\nand fellow Dao seekers are like **brothers** (兄弟).\nHow can one, lacking **reverence and filial devotion** (不敬孝),\n**friendship and love** (不友爱),\nor **compliance and accord** (不承顺和悦),\nfollow their teachings?\n\nWhen **masters and fellow Dao seekers** depart,\nleaving kin and kindred behind,\ndwelling in **mountains and forests**

(齐集),\nand designate the **highest in virtue** (高德者) as the **ritual leader** (法师).\nThe rest shall follow in **ranked order** (依位次第),\n**purifying themselves through bathing and changing robes** (沐浴更衣).\nThen, a **sacrificial platform may be erected** (可设坛出官),\nand the **rites of invocation and exorcism** (关启) conducted.\n\nIn cases of **urgent sickness or dire peril** (疾厄危切),\nor **grievous loss and profound sorrow** (亡殁极伤),\none must **immediately perform the rites** (应急就修),\nwithout awaiting the **Hosted Initiation** (不须宿启).\nEach shall **stand in their appointed rank** (各在依位),\nand **fulfill their designated duties** (主其职司).\n\nIf the rites are to be **conducted as a Hosted Initiation** (宿启),\nthen they shall proceed **according to established methods** (即依常法).\n\n**Morning rites for the Dao:**\nThe **ritual proceedings commence upon the platform** (法事升坛如式).\nEach **offers homage to the master’s lingering essence** (各礼师存念如法).\nThe **exorcising incantations** (卫灵咒) are

(与道合真).\n\nThe **Supreme Law Drum** (法鼓) is struck **twenty-four times** (二十四通).\n\nThe **Three Highest Heavens** (三天)—\n**Primordial Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** (玄元始天尊),\n**Supreme Dao Lord** (太上道君),\n**Supreme Old Lord** (太上老君)—\n**summon forth** (召出) their **subordinate officials** (臣等),\nthe **Three Five Functionaries** (三五功曹) within our bodies,\n**left and right celestial attendants**

      "translated_text": "We, Your humble servants, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in body, spirit, and life—devoting these merits to disciple [name] and all descendants. The True *qi* lies dormant as latent treasure, while the Perfected One descends to receive. Within, the *yuan* and *qi* congeal into purity; without, malevolent forces are repelled. The Northern Palace extends the year of boundless ease, while the Southern Bureau records the register of eternal life. Grievances dissolve, debts are reconciled, and harmony spreads through the nine clans, all peoples under heaven, both seen and unseen, and all living things—all sharing in this boundless blessing.\n\nNow, we again light incense and take refuge in the Teacher-Venerable Ones’ Most High and True Virtue. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True.\n\n**Repentance, command the demon, and step upon the void**—three rites performed. We humbly repeat the sacred ranks.\n\nWe, Your devoted servants [name] and the assembled ritual officials, with utmost sincerity and reverence, address:\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Natural Void,\nThe Most High Dao/Way Lord,\nThe Most High Venerable Lord Lao,\nThe Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven,\nThe Heavenly Sovereign of the Gourd Cluster,\nThe Grand Imperial Sovereign of the Northern Pole,\nThe Grand Imperial Sovereign of the Southern Pole,\nThe Supreme Saviour of the Eastern Pole,\nThe Earthly Sovereign who follows Heaven’s law,\nThe Highest Celestial Worthies of the Round Canopy,\nThe Royal Governors of the Four Quarters,\nAll Spirits and Saints, both past and present,\nAll True Celestials assembled at this ritual feast—\n\nWe humbly pray for Your boundless compassion and Your penetrating insight.\n\nBy fortune and merit, we have partaken in the True Transformation. The secrets of the Celestial Scriptures were early attained through practice. Examining the True Scriptures, we deeply understand their teachings. The Teacher’s grace is most profound, equal to that of a heavenly kin—one who turns the Wheel of Life and Death. Thus, we must solemnly offer this petition.\n\nNow, we dare to submit our plea: Your disciple [name] humbly acknowledges that our revered Celestial Master [name]—through virtuous causes—once attained the True Rank, wore the lofty mysteries, and revered the True One. Yet, our Celestial Rank remains incomplete, worldly toil unsettled, and suddenly bound by sickness and calamity, we nearly perished. Though all things must end, the fault lies with later generations, whose recklessness we now regret too late. The suffering is unbearable, and we fear our accumulated sins may hinder the Master’s ascension. We seek repentance to benefit both the living and the dead.\n\nYour disciples [name], from countless kalpas past, since taking birth, have:\n- Betrayed sovereigns and parents, failing to honor our elders;\n- Abandoned truth for falsehood, betraying teachers and deceiving friends;\n- Committed murder and cruelty, harming the innocent, envying the virtuous, and slighting kin;\n- Consumed life-bearing substances, violated purity, misused sacred scriptures, and blasphemed the Celestial Worthies, deceiving even our own forms;\n- Misinterpreted sacred teachings, recklessly revealing Heaven’s secrets, violating rites, and defying celestial decrees;\n- Practiced deceit, acted unjustly, enriched ourselves while neglecting kin;\n- Broken vows, violated precepts, and transgressed the Mystic Arts—failing humanity below and the scriptures above. Our names are inscribed in the Black Register, our merits lost in the Blue Ledger. Our sins have led to annihilation, and our misdeeds have brought ruin upon our teachers.\n\nIn the endless night of darkness, where has our vital essence gone? Without confession, how could we hope for salvation?\n\nNow, through fasting and Dao/Way practice, we repent our errors, seeking to purge both the living and the dead of their transgressions.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Most High Dao/Way and the Venerable Worthies command the Twenty-Seven Prisons of the Underworld and the One Hundred Twenty Departments of Yin-Yang Water-Fire to erase the karmic debts of seven lifetimes, granting us broad pardon, releasing our forms and spirits, and allowing us to be reborn in the Central Realm, receiving *qi* of wisdom. May we uphold the Mystic Arts, propagate the sacred teachings, become teachers for humanity and gods, and realize the Dao/Way of the Void.\n\nNext, we pray for the longevity of the Emperor, the unity of ministers, the harmonization of all under heaven, and the alignment of the eight directions. May all realms of suffering and the nine layers of darkness witness the light, free from all torment. May all creatures, great and small, across the land, share in this boundless grace and ascend to the shores of blessing.\n\nMay this illuminate the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion above and reflect our sincere repentance below. We humbly submit this petition.\n\n**Twelve Wishes Completed. The Incense Altar is Rekindled.**\n\nWe solemnly command the incense officials, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit officials to gather at the place where we performed the midday Dao/Way practice. There, gold elixir and jade-green pills shall spontaneously arise, along with herbs and hundred-spirits’ blessings, as the Celestial Worthies converge before this incense altar.\n\nWe pray that the Celestial Maiden and Boy attendants of the Ten Directions receive the fragrant smoke and swiftly convey our sincere petition to the presence of:\n- The Most High Dao/Way of the Boundless,\n- The Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven,\n- The Supreme Saviour of the Eastern Pole.\n\n**The Assembly Recites the Praise.

Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the Dao/Way’s teachings. The sacred incantations are proclaimed, and the divine light shines brightly, while auspicious *qi* swirls in abundance. The celestial tripod and dipper [箕斗] cast their radiance, and the sacred grove [芝宇] lies serene. The jade pupils [玉眸] hold the true essence, and the precious altar [宝坛] remains pure and dry. The night transforms into day, and the cycle returns to midday. The Great Summit [太华] flows with pearls, and the vermilion phoenix [丹凤] soars in the *Xuan* [玄].\n\nThe evil spirits are quelled, and the wicked are extinguished. With lofty steps, we ascend amid fragrant smoke. The Celestial Worthies gather in full, all arriving before the Emperor’s presence, merging with the Dao/Way’s true essence.\n\nThe sacred drum [法鼓] is struck twenty-four times.\n\nWe summon the Most High Dao/Way of the Boundless, the Three Primordial *Qi* [三炁] of the Heavenly Origin, the Supreme Dao/Way Lord, the Supreme Old Lord, and the following officials from within our bodies:\n- The Three Five Functionaries [三五功曹],\n- The Left and Right Officials,\n- The Left and Right Incense Bearers,\n- The Relay Dragons and Mounted Bridesmen [驿龙骑吏],\n- The Golden Boy Attendants of Incense,\n- The Jade Girl Scatterers of Flowers,\n- The Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols,\n- The Direct Day Incense Officials,\nand all thirty-six in total.\n\nThose who emerge are clad in solemn and dignified robes, their headgear and ribbons hanging in proper order. They open the gates of the Mystic Daoist Altars [玄坛] and the local deities [土地], as well as the regional spirit officials [方域神真].\n\nNow, as the sun sets and we perform the Dao/Way practice, we humbly offer this as our heartfelt intention. All our earnest entreaties have already been recorded and presented. We pray that the Supreme Dao/Way’s true essence of the Ten Directions, the Sacred Treasure and Auspicious Light, descend and enter our bodies, so that our petitions may swiftly reach the presence of:\n- The Most High Dao/Way of the Boundless,\n- The Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven,\n- The Eastern Pole’s Supreme Saviour of the Green *Xuan*.\n\nWe request the proclamation of the sacred ranks.\n\nWe, the undersigned [具位臣某] and all the assembled ritual officials, sincerely present this petition together. To the Heavenly Venerable of the Natural Void, the Supreme Dao/Way Lord, the Supreme Old Lord, the Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven, the Hook-and-Arrow Heavenly Sovereign, the Great Purple Emperor of the Northern Pole, the Southern Pole Emperor of the Vital Breath, the Eastern Pole’s Supreme Saviour of the Green *Xuan*, the Earthly Sovereign of the Posterior Soil who follows Heaven’s law, the Supreme Venerable of the Ten Directions’ Sacred Treasure, the Heavenly Venerables of all realms, the Heavenly Emperors of all realms, the Upper Clarity Worthies of the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Milky Way, the Three Officials and Four Saints, the Five Masters and Three Provincial Spirit Lords, the Nine Heavenly Celestial Functionaries, all the Spirit Lords, the Great Masters of successive generations who uphold the Dao/Way’s lineage and teachings, the Thunder and Lightning Spirit Tigers and Heavenly Physicians of all departments, the Daoist officials and officers from the Supreme Scriptures and Ordinances, the named mountain and cave deities who have attained the Dao/Way, the Great Emperor of the Underworld, the Holy Multitude of the Netherworld, the Great Emperor of the Eastern Pole’s Exalted Phoenix, the True Worthies of the Langyan Palace, the Five Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks and Five Heavens, the Earthly Sovereign of the Netherworld, the General of the Ten Thousand *Gan*, the Grand Marshal of the Earthly Branches, the Sacred Multitude of the *Wen* Command, the deities of the prefectures and counties, the city gods, the local spirit officials of the auspicious courtyard, the ritual officers of all departments, the Three Realms’ deities who extract souls and seize spirits, the Four Realms’ direct symbols and functionaries, the scribes who record and present petitions, the deities presiding over the *Jiao* feast, and all the seated True Worthies.\n\nWith reverence, we gaze upon Your boundless compassion and profound discernment. We, Your devoted disciples, have long benefited from Your sacred grace, drawing upon the pure *qi* to return to the Dao/Way’s transformation and partake in the true winds. Through the hidden precepts and sacred texts, the profound rituals and wondrous doctrines, we have attained harmony and enlightenment. Heaven’s blessings are vast and deep.\n\nYet, this disciple [弟子某], through the Master’s personal bond, once by fate’s convergence, was held in high regard by the Dao/Way’s teachings and prioritized in the Master’s true instructions. Together, we have transcended life and death, ascending and descending, guiding one another toward the Dao/Way. Now, in obedience to Your sacred words, we dare not fail to present this petition. The words are proclaimed.\n\nAs per the words spoken, our devotion is profound and sincere. We fear that our former Master, having ascended to the Daoist transformation, may wonder where our spiritual awareness resides. Their radiant presence has fled, and their voice and form are distant. Previously, we dwelled in the turbid world, now taking refuge in the Mystic Daoist Gate. Our practice is incomplete, our cultivation often neglected, and we struggle to transcend the Dao’s realm, still hindered by the Netherworld’s path. Our body has passed beyond the Three Officials’ jurisdiction, and we suffer the torments of all spirits. In these dark nights, our sorrow is genuine and deep.\n\nThus, we adhere to the ritual precepts and solemnly proceed together, following the Daoist teachings and venerating the true essence. We rely on Your grace to open the path and pray to repay the force that gave us life. We prepare the incense with utmost reverence, hoping to express our earnest aspiration. We purify our thoughts and focus our minds, devoutly observing the *Jiao* feast and its strictures.\n\nWith this evening’s Dao/Way practice, we request the ritual assembly to take this first pinch of incense and offer it upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, paying homage to the Three Supreme Venerables. We surrender our body, spirit, and fate, dedicating these merits to the ancestral temples, the spirits of the earth, and the celestial Worthies. May our virtuous *qi* rise to the Nine Pure [九清] and our spirits ride the clouds to the Eight Extremes [八极]. May Your blessings descend upon us, protecting our nation and bringing peace to its people.\n\nMay the Emperor of the Northern Pole extend longevity, and the Southern Mountain Emperor bestow prosperity upon all. May the world be at peace and harmony prevail within and without. May the court be filled with virtuous ministers, and the countryside have no abandoned talents. May all under heaven follow the Dao/Way’s transformation, uniting in the harmony of non-action.\n\nNow, through this act of burning incense, we have taken refuge in the Supreme Scriptures and the Great Saints’ true essence. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless and merge with the Dao’s true essence.\n\nWith this evening’s Dao/Way practice, we request the ritual assembly to take this second pinch of incense and offer it upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, paying homage to the Supreme Venerable Scriptures. We surrender our body, spirit, and fate, dedicating these merits to our former Master [先师某].\n\nMay the True Vehicle guide and protect us, and the Most Holy preserve and uphold us. May we bathe in the divine fire’s court and refine our spirits in the realm of penetrating *yang*. May we ascend to the jade gates of the True Worthies and receive the name in the Pearl Palace. May we praise the Dao/Way’s compassionate winds and open the path of wisdom for all beings.\n\nTogether with the Nine *Xuan* and Seven Ancestors, the Masters of scriptures and ordination, the upholders and monitors of the alliance, and the mountain-dwelling kindred spirits, may we all share in the blessings of victory and ascend to the true stages.\n\nNow, through this act of burning incense, we have taken refuge in the Supreme Scriptures and the Great Saints’ true essence. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless and merge with the Dao’s true essence.",

      "translated_text": "As the sun now sets, ascending the platform to practice the Dao/Way, we humbly request the assembled Dharma assembly to kindle these three strands of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend the celestial path, offering reverence to the Most High Three Masters.\n\nWe, the disciples, take refuge with body, spirit, and life, and with these merits, dedicate them to the lineage of our teacher [Name], extending blessings to our countless ancestors and kindred spirits, both living and departed. May the living inherit the resources of fortune and protection, while the deceased attain the grace of ascension.\n\nTo all within the revolving heavens and the eight extremes, to all sentient beings of earth and plant, to the Nine Nights and Three Paths, to wandering souls and stagnant spirits—may they all receive the Most High’s proclaimed benevolence and be bathed in the True One’s salvific grace, achieving boundless ease and eternal auspiciousness.\n\nNow, through this act of burning incense, we take refuge in the Teacher’s supreme virtue and the Great Saints’ true essence. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless and merge with the Dao’s true essence.\n\n**Repentance completed.**\n*East Azure, West White, South Vermilion, North Dark*—valid for all three watches.\n\nWe have heard that the Mysterious Dao responds to all circumstances and attends to every sentiment. The Celestial Sovereign’s boundless aid extends mercy in response to thought. Repentance clears the threefold karma, and atonement opens the Nine Abysses to prosperity.\n\nNow, through this turning of the scriptures and practice of the Dao/Way, we bow in homage to the Ten Directions’ Limitless Supreme, the Soul-Treasury Celestial Worthy, the Three Lights and Five Peaks, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, and the Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures. We, disciple [Name], with our teacher [Name], sever worldly dust and ascend the True Path.\n\nReflecting on past lifetimes and this very existence, from birth onward, we have accumulated merits and demerits—sometimes practicing compassion to save beings and teaching to guide people, yet violating scriptural precepts and transgressing prohibitions; sometimes applying Daoist methods while yielding to human emotions, favoring or resenting by circumstance, fostering grudges; sometimes constructing observatories, diverting waters, or tunneling mountains, disturbing dragon spirits and felling trees, leaving some harmed while others prospered, merits turning to faults. Or in transmitting the Dharma and teaching scriptures, disregarding proper timing, where kindness became a burden to the Dao and good intentions led to error. The Five Emperors and Four Officials have not granted pardon, and the Three Officials and Nine Departments still strike our offenses, confining us in dark prisons with no means of liberation.\n\nThrough this fasting and Daoist practice, we now confess our faults and seek mercy, hoping to purge countless transgressions. May the Three Venerable Saints respond to our sincere pleas, descend boundless grace, and forgive boundless guilt. Whether great or small, may all be cleansed.\n\nThus, may our names be erased from the Red Register, our sins expunged from the Black Ledger, the Dark Moon refined, and our souls ascend to the Vermilion Palace. May we traverse the Wheel of Fortune, attain True Rank, fulfill the Dao’s fruit, and forever escape the cycle of transformation.\n\nTo all ancestors, living and deceased, across countless generations, may they receive blessings, and all sentient beings share in honor. May the Dao’s light spread, benefiting future disciples, perpetually turning the Wheel of Teaching and magnifying divine transformation.\n\nOur petitions and supplications are now presented to the Mysterious Insight. May past karmic calamities dissolve, and present blessings descend.\n\nAbove, may the Celestial Sovereign’s benevolent grace be manifest; below, may our sincere homage be fulfilled. We humbly submit this prayer.\n\n**Twelve Vows completed.**\n*Restoration of the incense burner.*\n\nWe solemnly command the incense officers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Officers, and the attendant spirit officials of incense: May they now cause gold elixirs and jade-green herbs, as well as all hundred spirits, to naturally arise at the place where we previously set the sun and practiced the Dao. May the Ten Directions’ immortal youths and jade maidens attend the fragrant smoke, swiftly conveying our sincere petitions to the Supreme Limitless Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault, and the Sovereign of the Eastern Pole, the Green Celestial Emperor Who Saves from Suffering, before the Celestial Throne.\n\n**Exit the hall in praise.**\n**Depart the door.**",

      "translated_text": "「The heavens and the earth are separated by eight ten-thousand *li*,\nYet for common mortals, this distance is difficult to comprehend;\nThe Twelve States of the realm were established by decree,\nIndeed, the ghosts and spirits govern their respective domains.\n\nTo discern good deeds from evil, this principle determines life and death.\nIf one harbors a heart of fear and reverence,\nOne should wholeheartedly resolve to submit to it.\nThough we risk offense in presenting this plea to convey our intent,\nOur sincere sentiments have already been laid bare before you.\n\nMay the Heavenly Emperor of Equal Virtue, the Sacred and Renowned Sovereign of Mount Tai,\nExtend his boundless compassion and blessings to us,\nSo that our sincerity may be recognized and our prayers granted;\nMay his divine favor descend upon us,\nAnd the spirits come without constraint to answer our call.\nWith the gathered officials under his command, like thunderous judgment,\nAnd the assembled saints descending as clouds,\nTemporarily leaving their lofty abodes,\nTo grace this humble offering of incense and solemn rites.\n\nPitying the world’s sorrowful and afflicted,\nRescuing the lost souls burdened with guilt,\nSo that they may escape from the depths of *yōuliáo* [幽牢, netherworldly prisons],\nAnd perhaps attain the shores of the Dao/Way.\n\nNow, the altar is erected and the rites begin,\nThe proper forms are set forth,\nAs we earnestly turn our gaze toward the sacred,\nAnd focus our thoughts as if the deities were present.\nWe aspire to the highest realms of the Dao/Way’s transcendence,\nAnd hope to harmonize with the solemnity of this *zhāi* [斋, fast].\n\nOur humble petitions are thus presented to the utmost.\n\n**Recitation of the Precepts:**\nThe Dao/Way prioritizes fasting above all else.\nIn ancient times, sacrifices required fasting,\nAnd fasting required adherence to precepts.\nOne first observed the precepts before fasting—\nThe so-called *\"seven-day precepts and three-day fasting\"*.\n\nTo disperse the fasting over seven days is called *precepts* [戒].\nThe *precepts* [戒] are what enable one to reverently follow the sacred standards,\nTo avoid transgressions and wrongdoings,\nTo strictly abide by the precepts and laws,\nAnd to never stray from them.\n\nTo concentrate the fasting over three days is called *fasting* [斋].\nThe *fasting* [斋] is what enables one to purify the mind and spirit,\nTo clarify thoughts and intentions,\nTo focus one’s essence,\nAnd to seek communion with the divine.\n\nThe *Zhōu Li* [周官] records the duties of the *Tàizǎi* [太宰, Grand Overseer],\nWho, when sacrificing to the Five Emperors,\nSupervised the oaths and precepts of all officials.\nTen days before the ritual, he led the attendants in divination\nTo determine the auspicious day for taking the precepts.\n\nMoreover, the *Dà Sī Kòu* [大司寇, Grand Marshal of Punishments]\nOversaw the swearing of all officials,\nAnd the precepts were observed by all clans.\n\nThe *Tàizǎi* [太宰], as the official in charge of governance,\nAdministered the precepts to emphasize their importance;\nThe *Dà Sī Kòu* [大司寇], as the official in charge of justice,\nPresided over them to underscore their severity.\n\nThe *Lǐjì* [礼记] also states in *\"Jiāo Tèshēng\"* [郊特牲]:\nOn the day of divination for the *Jiāo* [郊, sacrificial field],\nThe king stood by the marsh,\nPersonally listening to the oaths and instructions,\nAnd receiving counsel—\nThis was the essence of admonition.\n\nWithin the *Xiànmìng* [献命] gate,\nThe precepts were administered to all officials.\nAt the ancestral temple,\nThe precepts were administered to all people.\n\nThus, the ancients sought communion with the divine,\nStrict in their precepts,\nSerious in their fasting,\nAnd so the heavenly spirits descended at the *yuánqiū* [圆丘, circular mound],\nThe earthly deities emerged at the *fāngzé* [方泽, square marsh],\nAnd the ancestral ghosts were pleased at the ancestral temple.\n\nThough these were the fasts of sacrifice,\nThey were not the *fast of the heart* [心斋].\n\nIn days past, *Yán Huí* [颜回] received teachings from his master,\nAnd though he abstained from wine and meat for months,\nHis master did not yet permit him to practice the *fast of the heart* [心斋],\nFor he wished *Yán Huí* [颜回] to listen not with his ears,\nBut with his mind,\nAnd not with his mind,\nBut with his *qi* [气].\n\n*Qi* [气] is empty and receptive to all things,\nAnd only when the Dao/Way gathers in this emptiness\nDoes emptiness become the *fast of the heart* [心斋].\n\nThe *Zhōu Yì* [周易] states:\n\"The sages use this to wash their hearts,\nRetreating and concealing themselves in seclusion,\nFasting and observing precepts to manifest their divine virtue.\"\n\nThus, the worthy receive the Dao/Way from the sages,\nAnd the sages, who share divine virtue with the celestial,\nMust practice the *fast of the heart* [心斋] to attain the Dao/Way.\nTherefore, it is known that only after the ritual of sacrifice\nCan one seek the *fast of the heart* [心斋],\nAnd then the divine and the Dao/Way will be born within.\n\nLater generations of Daoists established *jiǎo* [醮, expiatory rites] and called them *fasting* [斋],\nFor though the Five Classics record the fasts of sacrifice,\nThey differ in name but share the same essence,\nAnd their purpose remains unified.\n\nNow, during this fasting at Mount Tai’s altar,\nWe invite the Nine Grades of High Worthies to descend and occupy the sacred platform,\nMay the Heavenly Emperor of Equal Virtue review our fasting merits,\nBe moved by our supplications to the Netherworldly Officials,\nAnd rescue the guilty souls.\nThe heavenly spirits will descend here,\nThe earthly deities will emerge here,\nAnd the human ghosts will be pleased here.\n\nNow, in conjunction with this fasting,\nWe recite the precepts,\nAnd all present at the altar\nFirst receive the precepts and their constraints,\nAs a lasting foundation for the Dao/Way.\nImmediately, one should regulate body and mind,\nBanish external distractions,\nAnd focus on the Supreme Truth,\nSo that our petitions may proceed unobstructed,\nAnd our prayers be answered with certainty.\n\nThe words of the Celestial Worthies,\nThe true precepts transmitted—\nToday, we present seven conditions,\nAll should accept and believe them.\n\n**First Precept:** Do not kill or harm.\nPity all sentient beings as if they were your own life.\nThose who kill will face six retributions:\n1) A short lifespan,\n2) Many illnesses,\n3) Ugly and repulsive appearance,\n4) Physical mutilation,\n5) Suffering in the *Dìyù* [地狱, hellish realms],\n6) Being reborn as one of the six domestic animals,\n   To repay others’ flesh and blood.\n\nNow, within the Dao/Way’s sacred precincts,\nOne must not kill or harm any living being before or behind the altar.\n\n**Second Precept:** Do not indulge in alcohol.\nThose who indulge in alcohol will face four offenses:\n1) Impeding the sight of the world,\n   Causing loss,\n2) Preventing the practice of good laws,\n3) Generating excessive sleep and lethargy,\n4) Bringing madness and confusion.\n\nNow, within the Dao/Way’s sacred precincts,\nOne must not indulge in alcohol or licentiousness,\nNor offend the High Worthies.\n\n**Third Precept:** Do not harbor rebellious or deceitful thoughts,\nNor speak dishonestly.\nThe offense of dishonesty brings five retributions:\n1) Being subjected to cruel punishments,\n2) The destruction of one’s family and clan,\n3) Suffering in the *Dìyù* [地狱, hellish realms],\n4) Being reborn as a tiger or wolf,\n5) Living in barren lands,\n   With no peace of mind.\n\nNow, within the Dao/Way’s sacred precincts,\nOne must always speak honestly and truthfully,\nAnd await the scrutiny of the High Worthies.\n\n**Fourth Precept:** Do not lack filial piety,\nNor disobey one’s parents.\nThe offense of unfilial piety brings five retributions:\n1) Being punished by earthly law,\n2) Being abandoned by all sentient beings,\n3) Suffering in the *Dìyù* [地狱, hellish realms],\n4) Being reborn as a crow or owl,\n   To inflict harm upon one another,\n5) Even if one regains human form,\n   To live in poverty and hardship.\n\nNow, after hearing the precepts,\nOne must always uphold a heart of filial devotion,\nAnd await the judgment of Heaven.\n\n**Fifth Precept:** Always cultivate a heart of compassion.\nIf one sees sentient beings nearing the end of their life,\nOne should perform meritorious deeds for them.\nEven insects and plants—\nOne must especially refrain from harming them.»",

Protection:**\nThe Azure Yang (青阳) casts its radiant light,\nIlluminating the sun’s return to life.\nThe Spirit Tiger wards off malevolence,\nThe Flying Heavens toll their celestial bells.\nThe wicked are crushed, the evil destroyed,\nTen thousand demons bound in form.\nThe Nine Mysteries (九微) circulate the Dao,\nThe Eight Powers (八威) subdue the spirits.\nA thousand numinous beings (千真) register their presence,\nThe Three Realms (三元) dispel impurities.\n\nLeft, the Yellow Dragon is summoned,\nRight, the Six Celestial Officials (六丁) are invoked.\nSeven revolutions, eight harmonizations,\nOrbiting the Heavenly Scriptures.\nThe sacred aura stands majestic,\nThe Dao begins its course.\nAuspicious clouds flow forth,\nThe gathered brilliance of the Yellow Court (黄庭) aligns with the Dao,\nAs the true and the Dao merge.\n\nThe Sacred Law Drum (法鼓) is struck twenty-four times.\n\n**Reigniting the Incense Furnace:**\nWe summon the Supreme Three Heavens, the Primordial Origin of the Three *Qi* (三炁),\nThe Most High Dao Lord (道君), and the Most High Lao Lord (老君),\nTo bring forth from my body the **Thirty-Five Celestial Officials** (三五功曹),\nLeft and Right Officials and Messengers (左右官使者),\nLeft and Right Bearers of Incense (左右捧香),\nThe Postal Dragons and Mounted Envoys (驿龙骑吏),\nThe Golden Youth Attendants (侍香金童),\nThe Jade Maidens who transmit words and scatter

resplendent robes,\nWith caps and sashes trailing their ceremonial plumes.\nThe Land and Spirit Officials of the Mystic Platform (玄坛) are opened,\nAnd the regional deities and numinous spirits are invoked.\n\nNow, at this dawn ritual,\nI humbly present my intentions.\nMy sincerity is profound,\nAlready recorded and heard by the Celestial.\nI pray that the Most High Dao *Qi* (十方至真道炁) of the Ten

and sincerity,\nBeseech the **Supreme, Natural, Golden Gate, Seven Treasures Emperor** (虚无自然金阙七宝上帝),\nThe Eastern Palace’s **Great Unity Teacher, the Most High Saviour of Suffering** (教主太乙救苦天尊),\nThe lineage of Masters who transmit the scriptures and expound the teachings (传经演教历代师真),\nThe **Eastern Peak, Tai Mountain, Celestial Harmony and Benevolence Emperor** (东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝),\nThe **Virtuous and

Martial Examiners beneath the Peak** (岳下文武考校),\nAll Celestial Officials (一切曹僚),\nThe Three Realms’ responsive spirits (三界应感),\nAnd all numinous beings (一切真灵).\n\nAll look upon the boundless mercy,\nAnd descend to manifest the sacred compassion.\nWe hear that within the **Five Celestial Officials** (五明官),\nThe Celestial Sovereign pities those in the cycle of rebirth;\nAnd in the **Eastern Extremity Officials** (东极官),\nThe Great Unity (太乙) always rescues those in suffering.\n\nIndeed, for the ignorant masses,\nThey do not know the noble ones of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd drift like boats in the boundless sea of desire,\nDrowning in the river of attachment.\nTheir sins have already accumulated,\nTheir karmic bonds are difficult to escape,\nBecause of their greed for life, they lose life,\nAnd because of their pursuit of suffering, they obtain suffering.\nOnce they depart this world,\nThey long strike the **Yin Court** (阴司).\nThus, the Most High opens the **Gate of Salvation** (济度之门),\nAnd only those of true virtue (真格) may be recommended for elevation,\nAllowed to return with sincerity and repent their sins,\nAnd attain liberation from judgment to ascend.\n\nWhile worldly entanglements remain,\nThey cannot escape the **Six Roots of Impurity** (根尘之六);\nBut the **Broad Reach of the Sacred Law** (冲科广被)\nWill surely hear the **Three Declarations of Pardon** (赦宥之三).\nHow could they not take pity on the foolish?\nAnd yet, they may still deeply harbor those who repent.\n\nThe humble petitioners of the Dao,\nWith sorrow and suffering as our offerings,\nAnd blood shed in sincerity,\nLament the swift passage of time,\nAnd reflect deeply on the suffering of the **Netherworld** (幽圄).\nWe look to the **Peak’s Celestial Court** (岳府),\nWhich truly receives the lost souls of the departed;\nAnd with reverence, we set up the **fasting altar** (斋坛),\nHoping to move the Emperor’s intentions.\n\nHaving prepared our words and intent,\nWe dare not fail to present them.\n\n**Proclaiming the Words:**\nAs the words are spoken,\nThe deep lament and pity are manifest.\nIndeed, the rites for the departed are called **Great Matters** (大事),\nAnd those who face mourning must double their sorrow.\nThough the departed cannot be recalled,\nAnd the **Elixir of the Night** (夜丹) cannot be retained;\nYet the living truly hold sorrow and gratitude,\nAnd the sincerity of the fasting rites extends.\n\nDeeply contemplating the **Netherworld’s Judges** (管摄之冥司),\nWho are indeed the **lofty Eastern Peak** (崇高之岱岳),\nWe fear that the souls may still be bound in **affliction** (缧绁),\nAnd thus, we must **widely establish the means of salvation** (津梁).",

May they escape the **Shānhuǒ** [山火] prison’s unyielding bonds and be granted the mercy of the **Leiyǔ** [雷雨] deliverance.\n\nTheir transgressions of body, speech, and mind shall be cleansed; the **shénqí guǐ** [神祇鬼] who ensnare them shall be commanded to yield to the **Hánhóng** [涵洪] grace. May they meet the hour of resurrection, receive the transformation of rebirth, and follow the path of the lost to their wandering’s end, while witnessing our heartfelt sincerity.\n\nNow we burn this incense, **taking refuge in the Dao’s Great Saints’ supreme virtue**.

Indeed, the sacred peaks’ spirits strive to bestow blessings upon all mortals.\n\nAt this moment, when the sun is at its zenith, we perform the Dao/Way’s rites, and humbly request that the assembled **Sìqīng** [四清] bear this three-pinched incense aloft. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the **Tàiqīng** [太清] Celestial Realm’s **Jiàngshēng Tiānzūn** [降生天尊], the Ten Directions’ **Shībǎo** [师宝].\n\nWe now dedicate our bodies, our spirits, and our lives—may this merit return to our departed ancestors and wayward souls. We earnestly pray for the **Àihé** [爱河]’s stilling waves and the **Kǔhǎi** [苦海]’s ceasing tides; that they, once deceived and unaware, now hear and instantly awaken.\n\nThe sacred peaks’ spirits descend their grace—may their souls soar free in the boundless void. The **Kōngdòng** [空洞] gives birth to spirits, merging their **Zhuī** [炁] essence with the **Fànfǔ** [梵辅] realm. Ever freed from the depths of suffering, swiftly granted the mercy of **Liàndù** [炼度].\n\nNow we burn this incense, **taking refuge in the Dao’s Great Saints’ supreme virtue**. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True and the Way.\n\n**Chànyuán** [忏方], three invocations, three obeisances.\n\nYour humble servants of the **Jùwèi** [具位] ranks, with utmost sincerity, now prostrate ourselves before the **Xūwú Zìrán Jīnquè Qībǎo Shàngdì** [虚无自然金阙七宝上帝], the **Dōnggōng Jiàozhǔ Tàiyǎ Jiùkǔ Tiānzūn** [东宫教主太乙救苦天尊], the **Chuánjīng Yǎnjiào Lìdài Shīzhēn** [传经演教历代师真], the **Dōngyuè Tàishān Tiānqí Rénshèng Dì** [东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝], the **Shúmíng Huánghòu** [淑明皇后], the **Tàizǐ Guìfēi** [太子贵妃], the **Diànshàng Bǐnglíng Gōng** [殿上炳灵公], the **Xīqí Língwáng** [西齐灵王], the **Yuèxià Wénwǔ Kǎoxiào** [岳下文武考校], all **Yīqiè Cáoliáo** [一切曹僚], the **Sānjiè Yìnggǎn** [三界应感], and all **Yīqiè Zhēnlíng** [一切真灵].\n\nMay they all behold the vast mercy and descend to illuminate our humble supplications.\n\nWe have heard: when the **Wèitóng** [会同] gathers the Five Elders, the **Tiānzūn** [天尊] always listens to the Law; when the **Guāngzhào Jiǔyōu** [光照九幽] shines upon the Nine Depths, the **Fǎjiě** [法解] arises through prayerful invocation.\n\nDeeply moved by the suffering of the **Sāntú** [三涂], we are especially grieved by the hardships of the **Wǔkǔ** [五苦]. To examine and punish the guilty spirits, there are the **Jùtiān Lìshì** [巨天力士]; to enforce the strict laws of the **Yīnyù** [阴狱], there are the **Zhífǎ Shénbīng** [执法神兵].\n\nThe **Jiànshù Dāoshān** [剑树刀山] sever sinews and shatter bones; the **Liàngtāng Lúitàn** [镬汤炉炭] reduce flesh to ash. The **Niǎozhuó Shéyīn** [鸟啄蛇吞] and the **Lígēng Jùjiě** [犁耕锯解] bring torment beyond measure. Such suffering is truly lamentable.\n\nFortunately, the **Shàngshèng** [上圣]’s boundless compassion teaches the causes of their plight; the **Zhēnrén** [真人]’s pity allows them to know the path of virtuous conduct.\n\nThough bound by the **Sānyè** [三业] and stained by the **Liùchén** [六尘], they follow their desires, unaware that the **Shíhuǒ** [石火] moment cannot be halted. In receiving retribution and calamity, they only prolong the **Yèfēi** [夜扉]’s endless closure.\n\nYet even now, they may reform their hearts and turn toward the Dao, all granted deliverance from judgment and purification from sin.\n\nTo cultivate vast fields of merit, they must rely on the **Lánghán** [琅函] scriptures; to exalt the **Shènghào** [圣号], none surpass the **Dōngjí** [东极] **Tiānzūn** [天尊].\n\nTruly, this clears the roots of doubt and allows them to grasp the **Xīyí** [希夷] mysteries.\n\nYour humble servant, **Dìngguān** [醮官], in deep reflection, fears that the **Àifāng** [哀方] suffer more in death than in life, their sins accumulating even in their brief existence. The **Yèwǎng** [业网] remains unbroken, and the **Fǎqiáo** [法桥] is yet unreached. They must now depend on the **Miàoshàn** [妙善] to purge their past transgressions.\n\nThus, we solemnly prepare the **Zhāi tán** [斋坛], and with utmost reverence, perform the **Rùlǐ** [褥礼] rites.\n\nNamed **Xiānshēng** [先嵩], we ever raise our heads to gaze afar; our faces turn toward the **Yúntíng** [云亭], our hearts yearning for divine compassion.\n\nThe **Dānyú** [丹舆] and **Lǜbèi** [绿辈] await the swift arrival of the **Biāoxū** [飙忽]; the **Yǔgài** [羽盖] and **Níqíng** [霓旌] hope for the descending **Wēirúi** [葳蕤].\n\nMay they discern our sincere devotion and open wide the gates of deliverance. May the **Jiùkǔ Shàngzhēn** [救苦上真] respond in kind; may the **Zhìchuí** [坠魄] souls, once submerged, now submit and take form.\n\nSwiftly may they meet the **Nánjí** [南极]’s **Zhùshēng** [注生], and also gain the **Běidū** [北都]’s **Bùwèi** [部卫]. Gradually ascending the **Xiānlù** [仙路], they shall not stray from the path, and all shall be granted equal harmony in life and death.\n\nAbove, we honor the **Tiānzūn** [天尊]’s vast mercy; below, we fulfill our servants’ **Guīmìng** [皈命] sincerity. Thus we humbly report.\n\n**Shíèr yuàn** [十二愿]. **Fùlú** [复炉].\n\nWe now solemnly command the **Xiāngguān Shǐzhě** [香官使者], the **Zuǒyòu Lónghǔ Jūn** [左右龙虎君], and the **Shìxiāng Zhūlǐngguān** [侍香诸灵官], to bring us to the place where we once performed the Dao/Way’s rites at noon. There, **Jīnyè Dānbì** [金液丹碧] and **Zhīyīng Bǎilíng** [芝英百灵] shall naturally arise, and all **Zhōngzhēn** [众真] shall gather at this incense altar.\n\nMay the **Shífāng Xiānróng Yùnǚ** [十方仙童玉女] attend to the **Lántián** [兰烟], swiftly conveying our servants’ sincere supplications to the **Zhìxīng Wújí Dàdào** [至真无极大道] and the **Hàotiān Yùhuáng Shàngdì** [昊天玉皇上帝] before the **Yuè** [御].\n\n**Chūtáng sòng** [出堂颂]. **Chūhù** [出户].",

purging our defilements.\nMay we be absolved of our offenses.\n\nToday’s ritual master, **so-and-so**, deeply regrets the transgressions of the departed, **so-and-so**.\nFrom birth, humans are bound by the **Four Great Elements (四大)**,\nand our senses are formed by the **Six Roots (六根)**.\nFrom the roots arises dust,\nand dust accumulates into defilements,\nwhich grow worse and cannot be concealed,\nleading to grave sins that are hard to escape.\n\nTo rescue the **Nine Nights’ soul (九夜之魂)**,\nwe must repent the **Six Roots’ sins (六根之罪)**.\n\nFor we see the cause of suffering—\nthe **illusion of form (色)**—yet fail to recognize its emptiness (**空**),\nand thus let external things disturb us.\n*\"Do not gaze upon what is improper\"*—\nyet we still bear guilt before **Yan Yuan (颜渊)**;\n*\"Blind yet seeing\"*—\nwe are deeply shamed before **Zhuangzi’s teachings (庄叟)**.\n\nDelighted by the allure of beauty,\nwe indulge in the sight of **splendor and finery (青黄黼黻)**.\nEven more, when gold blinds us to true humanity,\nhow can we scrutinize the **footprints of virtue (视履)**?\n\nSuch sins stem from the **eye-root (眼根)**.\nToday, at this time, we vow to repent.\n\nAgain, if we take pleasure in **lewd speech (亵语)** and incline our ears,\nor revel in **heretical teachings (邪说)** and find joy in hearing,\nwhen we encounter the **whispering voices of clouds and dust (遏云绕尘之声)**,\nwe cannot help but be ensnared;\nwhen we hear the **urgent strings and hasty drums (急弦促柱之响)**,\nwe cannot resist lingering.\n\nBelieving in **erroneous doctrines and wild schemes (谬论狂谋)**,\nwe crave **licentious words and filthy speech (淫言秽语)**,\nyet fail to heed *\"Do not listen to what is improper\"*—\nhow can we claim to uphold **virtue and wisdom (尚德而为聪)**?\n\nSuch sins stem from the **ear-root (耳根)**.\nToday, at this time, we vow to repent.\n\nAgain, if we are intoxicated by **the hundred scents (五臭所熏, 百物交感)**,\nlike guests who steal fragrance in the dark,\nor husbands who abandon all for the **coastal allure (海畔之夫)**,\nchasing only the **pleasing odors (逐臭)**,\nwe demand **rich flavors (厚味)** and compete for the **savor of meat and wine (饮膳之膻香)**;\nwe

bring weariness to our brow.\nSuch sins stem from the **nose-root (鼻根)**.\nToday, at this time, we vow to repent.\n\nAgain, if we indulge in **the five tastes (五味)** and cling to **the eight delicacies (八珍)**,\nwe scorn **Yan Hui’s simple fare (颜回之箪瓢)**,\nand prefer **Yi Ya’s elaborate cuisine (易牙之刍豢)**,\nseeking only to satisfy our **mouth’s desires (口腹之足欲)**,\nyet unaware that **the cauldron’s heat breeds resentment (鼎镬之生冤)**.\n\nMoreover, **sweet-tongued treachery (利口覆邦)** and **crafty words that disrupt virtue (巧言乱德)**—\nthese wound like **spears and javelins (矛戟)**,\nand we lack **the modesty of the Duke of Zhou (雅之莫扪)**;\nwe **dishonor the sacred pivot (枢机)**,\nand follow **Zhang Yi’s deceit (张仪之尚在)**.\n\nThus, **words bring calamity (召祸)**,\nyet we fail to see that **taste is also emptiness (味即是空)**.\nSuch sins stem from the **tongue-root (舌根)**.\nToday, at this time, we vow to repent.\n\nAgain, if we seek **the body’s ease (安佚)** and neglect others’ toil,\nor push our **four limbs to their limits (优游)** in self-indulgence,\nwe **boast of our lofty halls and vast mansions (高堂广厦)**,\nand **lust after fine food and silks (美食鲜衣)**,\nmaking ourselves proud while harming others,\nand failing to **relieve the suffering of the world (博济)**.\nWhen told *\"Do not harm others for your own gain (害人而利己)\"*,\nwe **glance with scheming eyes (睢盱)**;\nwhen we **destroy others to fulfill our own desires (坏人以自成)**,\nwe do not consider **bestowing kindness (施恩)**.\n\nSuch sins stem from the **body-root (身根)**.\nToday, at this time, we vow to repent.\n\nAgain, if the **heart’s nature (心妄性本)** is unrestrained,\nand **intentions wander into the field of emotions (意入情田)**,\nwe are **disturbed by greed, jealousy, and rivalry (贪嫉妬)**,\nand **driven by joy, anger, sorrow, and delight (喜怒哀乐)**,\nyet we do not **follow Confucius’ Four Absolutes (四绝)**,\nand only **err in Xun Kuang’s Five Constraints (五綦)**.\n\nWe cannot **subdue the Heavenly Lord

above, we repent the **sins of the Six Roots (六根之罪)**.\nWe humbly pray that the **Noble Worthies (高真)** may forgive our offenses,\nthat the **Assemblies of Saints (众圣)** may shower mercy upon us,\nand grant us **awakening after others’ awakening (觉后而觉先)**,\nas well as **rebirth and death in accordance with the Dao (更生而更死)**.\nMay our **black ledgers of karmic debts (黑簿)** be dissolved by accumulated merit,\nand our **red sins of departed souls (朱陵)** be transcended through this ritual.\nMay Your blessings extend to future generations,\nand may we forever dwell under the **Dao’s shade (道荫)**.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao/Way (道)**,\nwe ascend to the **formless (无形)**,\nharmonizing with the **True Dao (道合真)**.\n\n**Midday Repentance for the Ten Directions**\nThe humble servants, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and entrust themselves to the **East Peak Jade Treasure Supreme Heavenly Lord (东方玉宝皇上天尊)**, the **Nine Breaths’ Heavenly Sovereign (九炁天君)**, all **Divine Beings and Immortals (神仙)**, and the **Assemblies of Spirits (诸灵官)**, devoutly repenting and offering thanks.\n\nWe humbly hear that **wood binds us in the world (束为木)**,\nand **virtue governs by benevolence

Qi, who lacked its way.\n\nNot wealth earned through toil was our aim,\nbut only the art of burglary and bribery.\nShouldering sacks, we rejoiced in sealed cords;\nforcing gates, we scorned locks and bars.\nA dropped hat won us hidden treasure—\nlike Zu Ban’s cunning plunder.\nA shared room demanded false gold—\nyet who could match Zhizi’s honesty?\n\nMarked by rusted hem, we fell to Zhang En’s snare;\neyebrows betrayed us—no escape from Yonghe’s gaze.\nBold in theft, yet cowardly in virtue—\nhow like Wang Cang’s deceitful reliance on guile.\nSuch wickedness accumulated,\nnow we reap our calamity and blame.\n\nWe fear that after death, the departed, so-and-so,\nshall fall into the fiery prison of the Northwest,\nentangled in the Taihua and Taishan officials’ scrutiny,\ntrapped in dark dungeons with no path to liberation.\n\nNow, with sincere devotion, we entrust ourselves to the **Boundless Taihua Heavenly Lord of the Northwest, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**.\nWe humbly pray that the holy ones take pity,\nthat the wandering soul be guided,\nthat all sins of theft be cleansed,\nand that rebirth in the blissful realm be attained.\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend to the formless,\nharmonizing with the Dao’s true essence.\n\n---\n\n**For the crime of broken faith, we now confess:**\n\nThe Heavenly Dao values rectitude and sincerity—\none must preserve truth to align with Heaven.\nWithout rectitude, how can one avoid transgression?\n\nWe, the officiants, now entrust the departed, so-and-so,\nand repent for the sin of dishonesty.\nFrom countless past lives to this present one,\nwe spoke in vain, betrayed oaths and covenants.\nArmor could not save the fallen soldier,\nyet we still claimed safety;\na broken cart’s wheels did not stop our false claims of travel.\nGold, unlike Ji Bu’s word, brought no honor—\nblame fell on friends who trusted us.\nOur sashes differed from Zi Zhang’s honest letters—\nresentment festered in the neighborhood.\nWe did not ponder the unyielding virtue of gold and stone,\nyet still dared to deceive the spirits.\nOur words, once spoken, were soon abandoned—\nlike the ruined speech of Lu’s people.\nOur virtue was divided—\nshameful as the *Odes* of Zhou.\n\nDeceitful and hollow, we deceived both others and ourselves;\ncrafty and false, we failed to move even mortals—\nhow could we hope to sway Heaven?\nWe sought only to blind the world’s blind,\nunafraid of the sun and moon’s judgment.\nWith sincerity lost, how could we escape transgression?\n\nWe fear that after death, the departed, so-and-so,\nshall sink into the dark paths of the underworld,\nentangled in the Three Officials’ scrutiny,\nwith no means of escape.\n\nNow, with sincere devotion, we entrust ourselves to the **Celestial Sovereign of Jade Emptiness, the One-Qi Heavenly Lord**.\nWe humbly pray that the Three Officials intervene,\nthat the departed ascend,\nthat all sins of dishonesty be erased,\nand that the fruit of effortless wandering be attained.\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend to the formless,\nharmonizing with the Dao’s true essence.\n\n---\n\n**For the crime of crookedness, we now confess:**\n\nThe Earthly Dao values sincerity and straightness—\none must walk upright to align with the land.\nWithout straightness, how can one avoid transgression?\n\nWe, the officiants, now entrust the departed, so-and-so,\nand repent for the sin of perversity.\nFrom countless past lives to this present one,\nour bodies bent like crooked hooks,\nour deeds strayed from the straight path—\nwe abandoned the righteous road and trod only the wicked.\nDeceitful and harmful to the good,\ncrafty and jealous of the virtuous.\nThe upright had no place for us—\nlike Yiwu’s stacked arrows in vain.\nThough the land had order, none shared the loyalty of Yu’s arrow.\n\nPraise and blame found no truth in our actions,\nwhile our cunning earned infamy among the shameless.\nA child of five could outwit us in the market’s deceits;\nthough the *Three Hundred Poems* were revered,\nwe knew no shame in hiding our deceit.\nOur efforts were spent in twisting and turning,\nyet we never considered the virtue of returning to rectitude.\nSuch transgressions accumulated,\nbringing only guilt and calamity upon ourselves.\n\nWe fear that after death, the departed, so-and-so,\nshall fall into the Nine Abysses’ prison,\nentangled in the Tangdu and Quancu officials’ scrutiny,\ntrapped in the cold realms with no path to liberation.\n\nNow, with sincere devotion, we entrust ourselves to the **True Sovereign of the Cavern Spirit, the Nine-Piled Earthly Lord**.\nWe humbly pray that Tangdu’s interrogations cease,\nthat Quancu spare the soul,\nthat all sins of perversity be cleansed,\nand that the fruit of effortless wandering be eternally attained.\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend to the formless,\nharmonizing with the Dao’s true essence.\n\n---\n\n**The All-Encompassing Night of Repentance**\n\nWe,

harvests;\nlet three years of tilling yield nine years of reserves,\nso the world may know no sorrow of barren years.\nMay every household live in peace,\nand every well be filled with

incense, and sacred texts**,\npresenting his heartfelt and earnest petitions.\nFacing the divine light, he conducts the **Rite of Expiation**,\nand before the spirits, he proclaims his devotion.\nMay the divine power turn from its wrath,\nand in mercy, regard his repeated supplications.\n\nMay the Five Stars follow their courses,\nbringing frequent abundance to the people’s grains;\nmay the Three Stages of Great Peace arrive,\nso that rain and sun fall in perfect harmony.\nLet the people bask in the **North Star’s** virtuous governance,\nand scholars glimpse the **East Wall’s** literary brilliance.\nMay merchants flock to the **Celestial Market’s** walls,\nand officials ascend to the **Literary Luck’s** hall.\n\nMay farmers’ seeds take root with bountiful blessings,\nand maidens’ silkworms thrive with plentiful harvests.\nFurther, may the **Star of Greed** vanish without trace,\nand the **Heavenly Dog** turn its head in retreat.\nLet the **ten-thousand-mile miasma of demons**
