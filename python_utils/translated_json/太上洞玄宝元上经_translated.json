  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Precious Origin Upper Scripture**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Precious Origin Upper Scripture*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties. One scroll. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Cavern Mystery Section, Original Texts Category.\n\n---\n\nThe *Supreme Precious Origin Upper Scripture*, also titled *The Wondrous Secret of the Source-One*, or *The Divine Decrees of the Five Emperors as Cultivated by the Jade Dawn Lord of Zouqu*, is concealed within the Chamber of Great Possession and transmitted to the Supreme Perfected.\n\nThe Supreme Lord spoke:\nThe Great Dao is vast and boundless, within it lies treasure—its treasure most refined. None can proclaim its glory, for its glory is lush and dense; none can match its nobility, for its nobility is most revered. None can equal its gate, for its gate is unparalleled, its portal stands alone. If you can seek it, enter without desire; if you seek it with desire, none can attain it.\n\nWith few desires and aspiring admiration, one’s resonance varies by degree. Modeling earth after heaven, abiding in the Dao’s spontaneity—spontaneity’s wondrous darkness responds to the Three Positions. The source of the Three Positions is one in essence; this essence stabilizes the void, forming substance through pattern. Inner and outer mutually require, merging into oneness. Oneness connects with the Three Powers; the power of humanity excels all categories. Harmonizing virtue with the Two Modes, it transcends the common. By recognizing the root source and preserving the endowment without loss, one eternally safeguards life.\n\nCultivating within the chamber, stillness deepens with concentrated thought. Beholding the wondrous as the sun, clarity comes and goes—dissolving the darkness of death. As the darkness of death gradually recedes, the darkness of life steadily lengthens. Attaining life without death is called \"obtaining constancy.\" Before constancy is achieved, one must constantly preserve awareness. Knowing constancy is called \"illumination\"; not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune. Misfortune arises from desire, greed and contention entangle, qi surges and thickens, karmic obstructions daily harden. The heart-spirit becomes confused, disasters and calamities entwine.\n\nWisdom awakens to this: restrain desire, refine the heart. Use purity to govern turbidity, rectitude to control deviation. Once deviation and misfortune depart, rectitude and fortune renew. To accomplish and to conceal—this is uniting with the Dao in truth.\n\nThe spontaneous Source-One responds to the myriad things as Three. The myriad things act and return through the Four Darknesses and Five Phases, circulating through the Six Voids, all returning to the ancestral One. The One is the Dao’s child: from it arises Two, from Two arises Three. Within the Three-in-One, numbers are boundless. One, two, three, four, extending to five and six—what the scholar cultivates is to diminish desire. With desire diminished and selfishness reduced, the Dao may flourish. Thus, the sagely perfected honor the One as master, serve the Two as teacher, revere the Three as friend, cherish the Four as companion, follow the Five as leader, and roam the Six as constancy.\n\nThese Six Constants must be harmonized and never separated.\nThe Five Leaders are the imperial banquets where thought and the Emperor convene.\nThe Four Companions are the sequences of darkness as their essence.\nThe Three Friends are the shared radiance of luminous brilliance.\nServing the Two is modeling the laws of heaven and earth.\nHonoring the One is revering the Dao Lord.\n\nThe Dao Lord is the mother-source of the Dao, abiding in non-action and profound stillness. This is what \"no desire\" illuminates, not what \"few desires\" practice. The practice of few desires is like a mother guarding her child; thus, advanced scholars revere the Dao Lord. Revering the Dao Lord is cultivating and preserving ritual. Modeling the laws of heaven and earth is practicing life-giving application. Shared radiance of luminous brilliance is observing day and night. The sequences of darkness as essence are acting and concealing in timely manner. The imperial banquets of thought and the Emperor are aligning with the king to establish merit. The Six Harmonies as constant communication are following the Dao to establish virtue.\n\nFollowing the Dao to establish virtue is guarding stillness, purity, and emptiness. Aligning with the king to establish merit is administering rewards and punishments in accord with the times. Acting and concealing in timely manner is speaking or remaining silent with restraint. Observing day and night is studying scriptures and inner contemplation. Practicing life-giving application is binding to the Dao’s lineage. Cultivating and preserving ritual is continuing the mysterious rank.\n\nContinuing the mysterious rank is accumulating learning and establishing merit, ascending the verdant steps in sequence. When the Dao and virtue are fully replete, one ascends to the ultimate mystery. Binding to the Dao’s lineage is building goodness in mutual generation, transmitting the enterprise to descendants, preserving the accomplished nature perpetually, and maintaining sacrifices without cessation. Studying scriptures and inner contemplation is reciting and chanting sacred verses, comprehending wondrous meanings, visualizing spirits with focused gaze, and uniting with the perfected. Speaking or remaining silent with restraint is acting when things align, ceasing when people forbid, persisting in adversity or ease, and nurturing correctness. Administering rewards and punishments in accord with the times is punishing deviation and aiding rectitude, illuminating the Dao to save the vulgar, restraining or promoting to achieve the mean, without obstinate certainty. Guarding stillness, purity, and emptiness is operating through non-action, non-action without stagnation, the Three Palaces at leisure, the Five Spirits at peace.\n\nFollowing the Dao to establish virtue is adapting to the absence or presence of things, attaining carefree wandering. Cleansing one’s own discernment, the mysterious observation is fully encompassing. Coming and going are not of the self; only the Dao is followed. Entering and exiting as things, merit and virtue do not depart.\n\nMastering these Six, one proceeds through the Three Scriptures.\nThe Three Scriptures are: the first to illuminate heaven, the second to illuminate earth, the third to illuminate humanity.\nThe Dao of humanity, the Dao of earth, the Dao of heaven—these are the Three Powers.\n\"Power\" means to裁 (govern) and to能 (enable): governing deviation to return to central rectitude, enabling the reversal of flowing ends to return to the root source.\nThe source is the Dao. The Dao’s origin is revered. Reverence is the human head, the ancestral root of accumulated goodness. When blockages open and passages connect, the Three Daos are collectively named \"One Root.\"\n\nThrough responsive transformation, forms diverge: the highest, clear and unobstructed, is exalted; the lowest, peaceful and compliant, is noble; the middle, harmonizing the two, is most revered. Reverence and nobility reach the highest—names differ, yet reality is one.\nThis \"one reality\" is neither dead nor alive, neither non-existent nor existent.\nThe differing names: the upper covers yet neither bears nor covers; the middle gazes comprehensively yet neither bears nor covers. From the beginningless midst of all-containing darkness, the Three naturally arise. They cannot be abruptly unified. The Three cling to existence, grasping at neither non-being nor being. Yet the powers have sharpness, dullness, and balance; understanding has beginning, middle, and end. The end sinks seeking stability, the middle floats praying for deliverance, the beginning soars hoping for tranquility. Thus, groups divide and categories gather.\n\nWithin the gathering and division, there are the sharp, the dull, and the balanced. The great Dao cannot compel them—once a single impulse stirs their response, it shows them where to go. Flying, floating, sinking—each follows its own origin. Thus, it reveals the Qian to guide those of the flying kind, manifests the Kun to receive those of the sinking kind, and establishes the Ruler to govern those of the floating kind.\n\nThe sagely ruler joins virtue with Heaven and Earth, skillfully dividing and nurturing to form the Three Origins. Each of the Three Origins has its revered one, and each title is established through deliberation. The dead Heaven is called *Di*, Earth is called *Huang*, and humanity is called *Wang*. The *Wang* is what all living beings turn to and revere. The *Huang* is what the vast, dark-containing all look up to. The *Di* is what all things hold in highest honor. Later responses vary in degree, and transformations differ accordingly. Within the sinking there is floating, within the floating there is flying. The flying act as *Huangdi*, the nine lands bear the title *Wang*. These are all partial names. The first was *Huang*, then *Di*; *Di* and *Wang* are raised together, their forms adjusted with the times, arising from the nature of things. Yet the power of transformation remains in use. To seek their fundamental intent, one must not fail to understand clearly.\n\nTo understand the Dao of Heaven, follow my *Upper Classic*. To understand the Dao of Earth, follow my *Lower Classic*. To understand the Dao of humanity, follow my *Middle Classic*. The *Middle Classic* can illuminate—illuminating Heaven and illuminating Earth. Yet one who illuminates Earth and illuminates Heaven has not yet illuminated humanity. To illuminate humanity lies in the *Middle Classic*.\n\nHuman form spans a full measure, and what it practices is *ren*. Even if *li* and *yi*, wisdom and trust, are all cultivated, to model oneself on Heaven and follow Earth is still not to become fully human. To become fully human is to thoroughly embody the *Middle Classic*. The *Middle Classic* holds the true. The true spirit descends, descending to unite with one’s own spirit as a single body. Yet one body holds two spirits, two spirits dwell in one body, blended without separation, constantly preserved and unchanged—only then is one a luminous human.\n\nThe true spirit is the wondrous darkness of the great Dao, responding to impulses and drawing near, merging with one’s own spirit. Once merged, there is no further division. This spirit has been within one’s body from the beginningless past to the present. Now, with merit complete and full, this spirit meets the Dao. Dao and spirit unite as one, the body also aligns as one. In oneness, wonder is absolute—beyond what the eyes of mortals can see, hence called formless. Yet it is not without wonder. The sage perceives it, perceiving it and merging with it. To speak of perceiving after merging is to be luminously clear. Inner vision knows no outer—it is not like gazing inward from without. Perceiving wonder arises from desirelessness. With desirelessness, words are now forgotten. Once words can be forgotten, preserve the precepts and reduce desires. The teaching of daily diminution leads to truth. Those who attain it are genuine. The current of reduced desire turns toward the true Dao. Looking up, observe the heavens above; looking down, examine the earth below; then look within to illuminate the center.\n\nTo illuminate the center is to preserve the Three-in-One. To preserve the Three-in-One, first observe the patterns of Heaven, then examine the principles of Earth.\n\nObserving the patterns of Heaven follows my Upper Scripture. The patterns of Heaven are the Three Luminaries. To \"observe\" is to divine by the Three Luminaries. The Three Luminaries are the sun, moon, and stars. They traverse three paths, advancing through the armillary sphere and measuring instrument. The sun departs, the moon arrives, revolving without end. The year reaches Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, their movements ever a warning, revealing calamity and manifesting fortune. The Northern Dipper’s nine stars—two concealed, seven visible—bright and dim alternate, drawing from the dark ford, moistening and harmonizing the dark, giving birth and completion without end.\n\nObserving the odes of spring, there are sixteen chapters. Yang pitches and yin tones harmonize, blending and tuning. Following the twelve months, winter solstice begins the cycle. The establishment of spring, spring equinox, establishment of summer, summer solstice, establishment of autumn, autumn equinox, establishment of winter, winter solstice—these eight nodes converge, belonging to the eight sounds, mutually supporting and perpetuating. Observing the odes of summer, there are twenty expansive chapters. Fire assists wood as propriety, wood engenders fire as benevolence. Spring’s virtue lies in sprouting and nurturing, summer’s merit in fostering growth. Pitches and tones harmonize, the eight sounds resonate, the Three Luminaries are unobstructed, and the seasonal order is proclaimed. Gathering these monthly nodes is called a year, thus belonging to Heaven.\n\nHeaven, in its first chapter, divides into two: before the vast generation and nurturing, it advances to guide the nurturing of life. Earth, in its eighty-first chapter, unites into one: after the killing and storing, it retreats to avoid punishment and destruction. Without this advance and retreat, superiority and inferiority are proven. The superior is practiced by the wise and sagacious, the inferior by the foolish and blind. This contrast stirs awakening, rousing the deluded. Those who comprehend grow daily in discernment. The storing of killing may be primordial, the nurturing of life may be unified. One descends into number to demonstrate and fix names for things. Names cannot be exhausted, nor are they bound by number. Thus, they reside within the five nines yet extend beyond the four nines. From ancient times to the present, their names do not depart. Therefore, the Upper Scripture has thirty-seven chapters.\n\nExamining the principles of Earth follows my Lower Scripture. The principles of Earth are the Three Colors. To \"examine\" is to await the Three Colors. The Three Colors are earth, mountains, and water. Surveying the five directions and the heavenly stems and earthly branches—positions of *jia-yi*, *bing-ding*, *wu-ji*, *geng-xin*, *ren-gui*, *zi-chou*, *yin-mao*, *chen-si*, *wu-wei*, *shen-you*, *xu-hai*—these twenty-two form the autumn odes, stern and distinct, without mutual confusion. Next are the nine provinces: Yu, Yan, Qing, Xu, Yang, Jing, Liang, Yong, and Ji. The Five Peaks are Mount Tai, Mount Heng, Mount Hua, Mount Heng, and Mount Song. The Four Waterways are the Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Ji Rivers. The Four Seas encircle the land, mountains, and waters, branching into twenty-two stems and twenty-two chapters as winter odes. Kunlun stands at the center, anchoring the four seasons. Forty-five chapters belong to Earth. Ascribing merit to Heaven, yielding and deferring upward, the Lower Scripture thus has forty-four chapters.\n\nThe source divides into the Two Modes of Heaven and Earth, named the two halves. Within these two halves, the dark sequence has four phases: first, true yang, the spring dark generating; second, yang within yin, the summer dark growing; third, true yin, the autumn dark killing; fourth, yin within yang, the winter dark storing. The four seasons cycle, and the year’s work is complete. The Three Luminaries revolve, and Heaven’s virtue is manifest. Thus, the Upper Scripture has spring and summer, benevolence and propriety, wood and fire, harmony and clarity. The Lower Scripture has autumn and winter, righteousness and wisdom, metal and water, compliance, sincerity, and trust. Earth pervades all, uniting in one scripture. The two scriptures establish positions, eternally illuminating the Two Modes, each with upper and lower, marking the four seasons.\n\nThe text of five thousand characters exhausts the Five Phases. Generation and nurturing are endless, virtue and merit unite. Number culminates in nine. The four seasons follow Heaven, multiplying in sequence: four nines are thirty-six. Thus, the *Dao Scripture* has thirty-six chapters. The Five Phases adhere to Earth, multiplying by Heaven’s method: five nines are forty-five. Thus, the *Virtue Scripture* has forty-five chapters. Heaven and Earth’s dark intermingles, two nines multiply: nine nines are eighty-one. Therefore, the two scrolls have eighty-one chapters.\n\nHeaven has eighty-one palaces, Earth has eighty-one domains, humans have eighty-one divisions, each with its numinous spirits. Through unity, the Dao is attained; attaining the Dao, spirits are communicated. Following Earth to model Heaven, Heaven acts without acting yet nothing is left undone. Yang initiates, yin responds. Earth achieves no merit, ascribing virtue to Heaven. Heaven divides the first chapter to clarify the intent of reward and completion, without desire or action, opening the path of eternal life and deathlessness. Earth unites the final chapter to illustrate the virtue of modesty and yielding, not harming with profit, magnifying the transformation of supreme virtue’s non-virtue.\n\nAll things do not desire yet are naturally upright, do good yet do not contend. Not contending, good is accomplished. Good is accomplished through mysterious reward. Rewarded with modesty, knowing the end yet guarding the root, the mysterious vision is flawless, its defense supreme. Thus, those who study this are called Supreme Perfected Ones. To study the method of the Supreme, one observes the patterns of Heaven above and examines the principles of Earth below.\n\nThe root of Heaven and Earth is formless. The formless is the Dao. Responding to things, it becomes being, having form and name. Naming Heaven and Earth, they are the Dao’s grandchildren, the One’s children. The Dao gives birth to the One, primordial qi. The One gives birth to the Two: internally called yin and yang, externally called Heaven and Earth. The Two gives birth to the Three: internally called harmony and qi, externally called humans. The Three gives birth to the myriad things. Yin and yang intermingle, the three qi distribute, bestowing according to kind. The myriad things array themselves. Humans receive abundant harmony and qi, thus \"the Two gives birth to the Three.\" The three qi are vast and generous, yet humans cannot be the parents of the myriad things. Therefore, they share Heaven and Earth as parents. The ruler of humans is most noble, called the Son of Heaven, the One’s grandchild, the Dao’s great-grandchild.\n\nThose possessed of the Dao and virtue are fit to serve as national teachers; the Son of Heaven honors them, and all refer to them as \"great-grandsons.\" The form of Heaven draws from the formless; when the One attains the power of generation, no form surpasses Heaven in grandeur. Embracing the One without parting, thus the character for \"Heaven\" (天) contains \"One\" (一) and \"Great\" (大). The formless gives birth to the formed, and the formed returns to the formless. The origin is taken as father, sustenance as mother. When the mother’s virtue endures and harmonizes, qi and things coalesce. Once things form, they ascend; Heaven inhales them, drawing them in with vast receptivity—like Heaven itself. Its pronunciation is glossed as *xiān* (先, \"first\"), also as *diān* (颠, \"summit\"), and as *xuán* (玄, \"mysterious\"). *Xuán* signifies suspended emptiness, mirrored above all things, standing at the forefront of all life—hence it is called Heaven.\n\nEarth is *tǔ* (吐, \"to spit forth\"), extending in three dimensions, manifesting above and below, giving birth to all things—like spitting forth. It is also called Earth. Its pronunciation is glossed as *dǔ* (睹, \"to behold\"), also as *lì* (隶, \"to serve\"), and as *qí* (齐, \"equal\"). Vast and great, it matches Heaven in virtue. Submissive and reverent, it supports and upholds, drawing things to behold its majesty. Humans and all beings emulate it: yielding, tranquil, harmonious yet not assertive, humble in success, never claiming achievement. Noble and base, before and after—its order is distinct, upright yet not deviant. It governs chaos, guiding all gradually back to Heaven—hence it is called Earth.\n\nHeaven’s patterns are clear and bright; Earth’s principles are tranquil and level—this is their constancy. When clarity fails, portents arise; when obscurity spreads, anomalies appear—this is not their constancy. Such extraordinary signs are not the work of Heaven and Earth; they serve as warnings to all beings, rewarding good and punishing evil, manifesting the extraordinary. These arise from humans losing the Dao, failing to model themselves on Earth, acting recklessly in violation of Heaven. Heaven and Earth send forth omens and anomalies as admonitions. By gazing above and examining below, one interprets portents and observes omens. Each omen has its cause; cultivating virtue and establishing merit dissolves them. If one can reform, abandon evil, and follow only the good, one models Earth’s steadfast tranquility.\n\nWhen the time arrives for movement, move in accordance with Heaven. To move in accord with Heaven is to move into the Dao. The path into the Dao lies in embracing the One. Embracing the One without deviation, the Three Ones become clear. One who clarifies the Three Ones unites with the Dao in truth. The perfected person studies this, firmly preserving the Three Ones. The Three Ones are Heaven One, Earth One, and Human One—also called the Upper, Middle, and Lower Three Primordials, or the Mysterious, Original, and Grand One.\n\nHeaven One resides in my *Upper Scripture*; Earth One in my *Lower Scripture*; Human One in my *Middle Scripture*. The *Middle Scripture* contains inner contemplation, each with its own distinct text. The reason there are three scriptures is that they arise naturally from the Three Qi. The wondrous qi of the Great Dao contains Three within One: yin-yang harmony, the Mysterious-Original-Beginning, and the Upper-Middle-Lower—all arising spontaneously. None can make them so, nor prevent them from being so—hence they are called the Natural Three Qi.\n\nThe *Upper* and *Lower Scriptures* also have their own texts. The reason the text comprises five thousand words is this: the Dao generates the Three Qi, the Three Qi generate the myriad things, and all things ultimately return to the One Dao. At the beginning, these Three Qi unite. The Five Numbers are established thus: the Dao’s One Qi is not yin-yang harmony but stands above the Three Qi. The myriad things’ One Qi is also not yin-yang harmony but stands below the Three Qi. Below the Three Qi, there are Three in the coarse; above the Three Qi, there are Three in the subtle. Subtle qi is colorless; all colors derive from it to take form. Coarse qi has color, but its colors are chaotic and obscure. Obscurity awaits the descent of the subtle to attain clarity. Clarity and obscurity cycle through the Three Qi in operation. Through their hidden and manifest workings, the Five Positions are established. Heaven and Earth, the Two Modes, operate through the Three Qi. One transformation reaches its limit at ten; ten transformations reach their limit at a hundred; a hundred transformations reach their limit at a thousand. When numbers reach their limit, they transform—but transformation does not exceed Three. The Three Essences reside in the Dao; beyond that, they reside in things. The myriad things transform into coarseness; to seek essence, return to Three. The Three transform to benefit things, and the Five Natures are completed—hence the text’s five thousand words, its principles all-encompassing.\n\nThe principles have a beginning and an end; the text has its sequence. The reason *\"The Dao that can be spoken\"* is placed first is to present the source in order to encompass the branches. *\"Without desire\"* and *\"with desire,\"* along with *\"good\"* and *\"evil,\"* are divided into two chapters because without desire, one perceives the subtle and attains long life, while with desire, one is mired in the coarse and meets death. Life and death arise from the human heart; the heart’s wisdom determines superiority or inferiority—this clarifies the broad outline, hence their placement in sequence. The subsequent details concern good and evil. Good and evil can be stilled, opening the way for the active mind. The active mind cannot be stilled all at once, nor can one immediately ascend without desire. For those who desire to be without desire, few desires bring little knowledge; knowing good as not-good, one forgets it to still desire. The method for stilling desire begins with reducing affairs. The essence of reducing affairs is to seek substance and discard ornament, eliminating falsity—hence the next chapter is *\"Not exalting the worthy.\"*\n\nTo discard exaltation saves the俗; hence the next is *\"The Dao is empty yet in use.\"* All things, without exception, are born and die, never enduring. Only the eternal abides. The eternal Dao has no ancestor, no predecessor; its transformations follow the times, boundless and infinite. In the beginning, when simplicity prevailed, it practiced the teaching without words. Later, when shallowness spread, words and images were mutually displayed. Those close in sentiment fail to grasp distant intent, often mired in words and images, sinking into delusion. Thus, the first chapter first dispels names and words, so one may know the eternal is not exhausted by names and words, yet the eternal is attained through names and words. Names and words are not the eternal’s essence. The root is quiescent, its responses active—truth and falsity differ. Expediency and reality, the myriad wonders, all emerge from the Mysterious Gate. Yet sentient beings, since beginningless time, possess mind and consciousness. Consciousness does not perish; the body undergoes death and life. The suffering of death and life torments the consciousness. One moment mixed, the next separate—endlessly entangled. Without severing the bonds, courageously transcending the multitude, and diligently accumulating merit and virtue, none can escape the pain of birth and death.\n\nThe pain of birth and death arises from emerging from non-being into being. Deep desire binds one in karmic fetters. To sever desire is to be without desire; slight goodness brings rebirth. Rebirth brings joy, attachment, and clinging. Love and desire follow one another; unable to sever them, one fails to broadly cultivate goodness. Sloth and doubt arise; evil roots flourish. Good deeds remain unaccomplished, and the pain of death returns. Lifespans are brief, yet anxieties and fears extend—all stemming from desire. Thus, the text first clarifies *\"without desire\"* and *\"with desire.\"*\n\nThe calamities of desire lie in good and evil—each captivating the heart differently, their excesses solidifying into disaster. To abandon evil and embrace good, yet remain unclear on what constitutes good and evil, is to invert perception, allowing beauty to disorder the spirit. What one deems beautiful may not be good; even when good is recognized, it may still deviate from the Dao-heart. The Dao-heart shuns attachment, embracing reality and abiding in truth, without vain aspiration or competitive striving. Silently, it nurtures latent cultivation, free from alarm or doubt. Trusting and yielding to the Three Treasures, it conceals wisdom and forgets merit. Those who can do this may proceed toward the Dao. Thus, after the chapter’s opening on the three transformations, it clarifies the emptiness of the Dao and its application. Yet the Dao has no form or shape; words and images serve only as渡津. Having spoken of its emptiness and function, one realizes that its function is truly without substance—this \"substanceless substance\" existed before the Emperor.\n\nWhat follows the Emperor should model itself on the later to return to the prior. Hence, the next section elucidates the Heavenly Sage as worthy of emulation. All should emulate the Sage, yet emulating the Sage is not achieved through physical strength but requires the spirit’s diligent refinement, advancing daily, before one may ascend the mysterious peak. The spirit must not be disturbed, so the next section speaks of the Valley Spirit. Nurturing the spirit leads to the realm of deathlessness; the marvel of deathlessness is to merge with the Dao. Merging with the Dao makes one the root of Heaven and Earth; as the root of Heaven and Earth, one unites with them. Such union, though ashamed to save beings through fixed methods, attains effortless realization. Thus follows the section on *\"Heaven’s duration, Earth’s endurance.\"* The fruit of endurance arises from gentleness and compliance, so next comes *\"The highest good is like water.\"* Water, when added, fills and overflows; when stilled, it becomes clear and reflective. Thus follows *\"Hold it and it is full.\"*\n\nThe essence of not being full lies in achieving success and withdrawing. The dwelling of withdrawal is the realm of non-duality, so next comes *\"Bear the soul and embrace the One.\"* Embracing the One perfects mysterious virtue; mysterious virtue engenders without claiming, and beings naturally turn to it. Thus follows *\"Thirty spokes share one hub.\"* Beings honor the One’s function of emptiness; emptiness values formlessness. Yet the desire for form is hard to eliminate, so next comes *\"The five colors.\"* Shedding external flourishes reveals inner truth. Stop when it is time to stop, act when it is time to act—movement and stillness serve as teachers. One must hold office in the world, discerning when to advance or retreat. Thus follows *\"Favor and disgrace.\"*\n\nWhen both favor and disgrace evoke alarm, ascent and descent proceed without hindrance. Guarding against calamity without slack, myriad blessings renew. Rising from low to high, the world entrusts itself to such a one. Entrusted by the world, one must embody the Dao. The Dao’s marvel is formless, so next comes *\"Look for it and it cannot be seen.\"* Knowing the Three-in-One, wielding the ancient to govern the present—wielding the ancient to govern the present, one becomes a Sage-King above, a Sage-Minister in the middle, or a Sage-People below. Sagacity arises from accumulated goodness, so next comes *\"The good scholar.\"* The scholar is one who serves; all, high and low, serve through goodness. The good scholar embodies the ancient while studying the present. When present study aligns with the ancient, stillness is preserved without deviation. Thus follows *\"Attain utmost emptiness.\"*\n\nKnowing constancy aligns with the Dao, one may move left or right, up or down, as king or duke. United with Heaven and the Dao, one ensures lasting security—hidden yet unharmed, manifest yet unendangered. Losing this Dao, virtue becomes graded in excellence, so next comes *\"The highest.\"* This chapter on the *\"Highest\"* marks the boundary of spring’s verses, bridging the upper and lower sections, shifting the numerical progression. The *\"Highest\"* becomes the beginning of summer’s verses, aligning *\"Utmost Emptiness\"* as the sixteenth’s conclusion.\n\nThe response of the *\"Highest\"* is birth, nurturing, and maturation—maturation marked by the year’s end. The celestial stems and lunar phases align with light and shadow; form and spirit rest upon Kunlun. *\"Lun\"* signifies the pivot of transformation and guidance, ensuring longevity and deathlessness—hence its place in the *\"Nurturing\"* chapter. *\"Kun\"* signifies blending and returning to truth—hence its place in the *\"Birth\"* chapter. Inner concealment and outer tranquility ensure no danger or harm; peace and security endure, whether hidden or manifest. Few in the world can uphold this, so next comes *\"When the Great Dao declines.\"* Losing the Dao, one competes in ability, exalting external pursuits, yet returning to inner cultivation. Thus follows *\"Abandon sagacity.\"*\n\nCultivating the inner self, one shines without dazzling. Teacher and disciple practice humility and silence, dispelling misfortune and averting calamity. Thus follows *\"Abandon learning.\"* With external competition stilled and no inner strife, vastness encompasses all. Thus follows *\"The capacity of great virtue.\"* Enduring humiliation and dwelling in lowliness without complaint, one’s abiding is the Dao. Thus follows *\"Bend and be whole.\"* Bending yet remaining whole is the principle of nature, graspable in the heart yet indescribable in words. When numerical progression is exhausted, one avoids it; upholding silence expands it. Thus follows *\"Sparse speech.\"* Sparse speech and silent awareness uproot the sprouts of vain longing, so next comes *\"The forked path does not stand.\"* Without self-aggrandizement, one is deemed Dao-possessing. The Dao of the Dao-possessing existed before Heaven and Earth, so next comes *\"There was something undifferentiated.\"*\n\nThe undifferentiated holds the prior position; response and transformation follow. Divided into the Four Greats, the Four Greats have their directions. Successive teachings descend, prizing stillness as the foundation. Thus follows *\"Gravity is the root of lightness.\"* Gravity and stillness attain the center; external pursuits leave no trace. Salvation and aid exclude nothing; teacher and disciple harmonize. Thus follows *\"Good conduct.\"* Teacher and disciple united in the Dao know hardness and softness. Softness and hardness complement each other, returning to simplicity. Simplicity does not remain forever undifferentiated; when its course unfolds, it disperses, then reunites. Thus follows *\"Know the masculine, hold to the feminine.\"* Mastering both masculine and feminine, one aids governance and leadership. Attaining the center, abandoning extravagance, and embracing effortless action, thus follows *\"Desiring to take the world.\"*\n\nAs simplicity disperses and disorder arises, one is compelled to govern. Governance must not rely on military force, so next comes *\"Use the Dao to assist the ruler.\"* When compelled to act, one acts with merit; upon success, one retreats—never clinging. Thus follows *\"Fine weapons.\"* Probing the inauspicious and abandoning it aligns with the Dao. The Dao’s essence is withdrawal; in withdrawal, no doubt remains. Doubt dispelled, the world cannot be subjugated. Kings and lords in office do not pride themselves on superiority or monopolize profit; beings naturally submit. Thus follows *\"The Dao is eternally nameless.\"* One who enables beings to submit naturally unites virtue with Heaven and Earth. Sweet dew descends, and the world attains great peace. The cause of such an encounter lies in self-knowledge. Self-knowledge leads to contentment; contentment ensures no loss. Thus follows *\"To know others is wisdom; to know oneself is enlightenment.\"* Entrusting transformation to hidden radiance, the spirit merges with the Dao—appearing and vanishing freely, responding to stimuli without constraint. Thus follows *\"The Great Dao flows everywhere.\"* It responds to beings without fixed method; its attainment lies in...\n\nThe wondrous darkness—darkness wondrous and formless,\nformless yet wondrous—thus follows *\"Grasp the great image, all beings revere it.\"*\nOne who attains this wondrousness guides the multitudes,\nrestraining and elevating with method. Thus follows *\"When about to contract it, first expand it.\"*\nExpansion and contraction achieve balance; the keen instrument remains hidden.\nActing yet not acting, one ultimately unites with the Dao.\nThus follows *\"The Dao is eternally non-action.\"*\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\nWhen beings arise, stabilize them with simplicity.\nSimplicity being desireless, the world rights itself.\nRightness ensures perpetual union with the Dao.\nUnited, words are forgotten; forgetting words lies in rightness.\nRightness rectifies the perverse.\nThus the year’s harvest ripens, seasonal cycles complete their circuit.\nThe four darknesses and five phases combine to form twenty.\nThe earth does not claim merit; reverence for virtue rests in Heaven.\nOne chapter makes a year—thus twenty-one springs.\nThe four darknesses multiply themselves to illuminate the primacy of virtue’s singularity.\nSingularity embraces the four darknesses—hence sixteen precedes,\nencompassing autumn and winter.\nWithin, it harmonizes nurturance and growth;\nwithout, it governs killing and storage.\nIt compels humility, relinquishing yin to return to yang,\nthe two halves converging at the center.\nThe harsh and rigid are subdued; the coarse and soft interpenetrate.\nThus the wondrous completion of the year resides above.\nAbove contains below; below’s virtue reaches its apex,\nand in the end is called \"above.\"\nThose of supreme virtue transform and guide killing and storage,\nredirecting them toward life and bestowal.\nThey descend in person to lead the lowly.\nThe coarse below naturally differ,\nyet through the wondrous, they unite above.\n\nThe earth is the earthly form of heaven; virtue is the responsive manifestation of the Dao. All things proceed by degrees, their forms appearing as those of humans. Should humans awaken and cultivate this supreme virtue, their virtue ascends to unite with heaven, and in turn, reunites with the Dao. Thus is the *Dejing* named, with \"supreme virtue\" as its beginning, for the beginning guides all that follows. Those who attain the Dao never lose it, and this is called \"virtue.\" Virtue has grades—superior, middling, and inferior—each expounded in breadth, arranged in necessary sequence. Some advance by leaps, others by gradual steps, each according to their own method. Now, following the ancient model, the text proceeds with \"of old, those who attained the One.\"\n\nThe One is the master of response; as master of the One, it responds to the myriad things. All things have their origin, and that origin is the One, which ought to be preserved. Preserving it without wavering, one’s movements oppose the vulgar. Opposing the vulgar, one returns to the Dao. Thus follows: \"Reversal is the movement of the Dao.\" Reversal is the path; the central path is most easily traversed. Hence follows: \"The highest scholar, hearing of the Dao, diligently practices it,\" for they must reach the source. The source ought to be known, so next comes: \"The Dao gives birth to the One.\" Knowing the One as the primordial source, preserving harmony, one accords with it. Thus follows: \"The softest under heaven,\" for softness is humility and non-contention. Those who contend for merit and fame lose their bodies and scatter their spirits. Hence follows: \"Which is dearer, fame or life?\" Vastly guarding the Dao leaves one insufficient in the eyes of the vulgar, so next comes: \"Great perfection seems flawed.\" Flaws are false, while wholeness is true. Removing calamity and welcoming fortune, thus follows: \"When the world has the Dao.\" The Dao is present everywhere; inward contemplation and self-examination yield it in the heart. Hence follows: \"Not leaving one’s door.\" Leaving one’s door to seek gain is coarse and contrary to the wondrous. To urge awakening to this, next comes: \"In the pursuit of learning.\" The flowery can be abandoned; desires must be diminished to attain the true. Accord with things, overcome obstacles, and do not cling to stubborn emotions. Thus follows: \"The sage has no constant heart.\" The heart responds to stimuli; when stimuli arise, it responds—not by seeking, but without desire. Flowing freely without fixed direction, in movement and stillness, only the Dao responds. The form of this response is called \"sage.\" Those who study the Dao and accumulate virtue are also called sages. Though the two sages differ in origin, they converge in unity. Unifying the heart to aid others, they guide the living and deliver the dead. The dead may reform; repentance restores life. The living may cultivate; nurturance ensures immortality. Life and death depend on the nine orifices and four gates, hence follows: \"Coming into life, entering death.\"\n\nThose who wish for life amid death must recognize the source. Thus follows: \"The Dao gives birth to them.\" Seeking life, one attains life, yet life’s affairs are manifold. Affairs have beginnings and ends; to govern them, one employs methods. Opening and closing have their proper ways, so next comes: \"The world has a beginning.\" The beginning ever illuminates the end; illuminating the end ensures perpetual opening. Intervals rely on clarity to aid progress, hence follows: \"Causing me to be steadfast.\" Those who can walk the great Dao shine inwardly while concealing their light outwardly. They delve to the root and secure the stem, ensuring endless descendants. Thus follows: \"What is well planted cannot be uprooted.\" Cultivating the self to the utmost extends to all under heaven; embracing the Dao preserves one’s authenticity. Hence follows: \"Those who contain profound virtue.\" Silently recognizing and diligently following, preserving it without loss, thus follows: \"Those who know do not speak.\" The speech of non-speech speaks to save others, dispelling evil and quelling disorder. Hence follows: \"In governing the state, rectify it.\" Ultimately, non-action is prized, and the proliferation of laws is not displayed. Thus follows: \"Its governance is dull and dim.\"\n\nThe past is boundless, the future endless, and the present without limit. For those who were good in the past, one reflects and studies to rescue oneself. For those who were not good, one aspires to deliver them, ascending together to the Dao’s realm. The future is endless, its subtleties and coarseness unfathomable; one must not treat it carelessly. The present is without limit, with high and low intermingling. The good establish goodness, drawing others to share in it, ascending together. The evil are transformed, all crossing the bridge of the Dharma. Thus follows: \"In governing people and serving heaven.\"\n\nAutumn’s songs differ, yet difference is not goodness. One must not usurp position; convergence and communication are essential. Though there are two chapters, they remain within the bounds of five and nine, guiding toward long life and enduring vision, without further division. Those who can deeply root and firmly secure the stem may aid others in spirit. Thus follows: \"Governing a great state.\" Virtue having converged, stillness brings peace to the small. Hence follows: \"A great state flows downward.\" Where does the flow lead? It leads to the great Dao. Thus follows: \"The Dao is the refuge of the myriad things.\" Knowing this refuge’s subtlety, one saves the multitude of the coarse. One must not act as though it exists, so next comes: \"Act through non-action.\" Ceasing action, one prevents gradual encroachment. Thus follows: \"Its tranquility is easily maintained.\" Commanding steadfast cultivation of virtue, verifying it through the ancient masters, hence follows: \"Of old, those who were good at practicing the Dao.\" Practicing the Dao has many methods, but the essential lies in humility and weakness. Humility nurtures the self; weakness is put to use. Enduring without loss, the small can become great. Thus follows: \"The rivers and seas.\" Guarding this humility, the vulgar cannot bear it. Hence follows: \"All under heaven say I am great, yet seem unworthy.\" Possessing the three treasures, one averts death and preserves life. Thus follows: \"Those who are good as scholars do not contend.\" Such virtue matches heaven, and heaven harms nothing. Hence follows: \"On the use of arms, there are sayings.\" Compassion and sorrow are the foundation; with the foundation established, the Dao is achieved. Few can understand this, so next comes: \"My words are very easy to know.\" The common people do not preserve their allotted place, falsely claiming ignorance as knowledge. Thus follows: \"To know yet seem not to know is superior.\" The foolish lose the Dao, unable to fathom the divine. Not knowing reverence, they offend and invite disaster. Hence follows: \"The people do not fear authority.\" The common people cling to their hearts, unable to practice non-action. They do evil but not good, emboldening their misdeeds. Thus follows: \"Brave in daring.\" Not attaining the proper object of bravery, hence follows: \"The people constantly do not fear death.\" The above transforms the below; the below’s transgressions stem from the above’s influence. Thus follows: \"The people’s hunger.\" Life takes food as its foundation, and the foundation takes the Dao as its master. The master teaches through softness and weakness. Hence follows: \"A person’s life is soft and weak.\"\n\nWithin weakness lies strength; weakness can strengthen the Dao. Those whose Dao is strong attain harmony, and harmony resides within. Thus follows: \"The Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow.\" Harmony, softness, and weakness can overcome coarseness and rigidity. Taking proof from reality, thus follows: \"Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water.\" Contending in strength breeds mutual enmity and entanglement, while coarse harmony falls short of non-contention. Thus follows: \"Harmonizing great resentment.\" Without resentment, one is perpetually good, and the Dao of Heaven accords with them. Ever diminishing and reducing, they then preserve the great and abide in abundance. Thus follows: \"A small state with few people.\"\n\nWorldly discourse delights in ornate words, flowery yet insubstantial. The trustworthy words of the Dao are plain yet not embellished. The wise choose substance and discard ornament. Thus follows: \"Trustworthy words are not beautiful.\" This chapter, together with the Sage’s non-accumulation, clarifies that the more one gives to others, the more one ultimately returns to Heavenly virtue. Thus, \"beneficial yet not harmful\" is the pinnacle of the human Dao; \"acting yet not contending\" is the virtue of non-contention. Few can fully embody this, hence the need for guidance—enticing, leading, and instructing—to ascend from below to the heights, to turn the lowly into the exalted, and to abandon stagnation and evil in favor of smoothness and goodness.\n\nAll this derives from the Five Thousand Characters. Five thousand characters in fivefold arrangement: when the five virtues are fully realized, the absence of even a single word leaves the principle incomplete. This is the root of the Dao, born of the Great Void. Void yet not void, within nothingness lies being; within being lies wondrous invincibility. It nurtures all life, the root of ceaseless generation. It is called the formless chaos, without shape or appearance. The appearance of the shapeless cannot be grasped by thought; thought arises from language, and language conveys meaning. Yet meaning cannot be confined to language, nor can terse language exhaust meaning. Meaning lies beyond language, and the discerning delve deeply into it. By grasping one corner, they infer the other three—this is the mark of the wise and virtuous.\n\nThe qi of the Dao is mysterious and wondrous, without ancestry or precedence, without beginning or origin, without limit or end. It is desireless and thoughtless, actionless and effortless, pure and clear, tranquil and serene. Neither pure nor turbid, neither increasing nor diminishing, it embraces and contains the immeasurable. All existence and non-existence—its wondrous qi cannot be defiled, its mysterious form cannot be described. Forced into words, it is called the Dao, named the Formless. Within the formless, all forms are contained; all forms intermingled are called the Primal Unity. From this unity, all things are born, countless and boundless.\n\nBroadly divided, it is commonly expressed in five aspects:\n1. Non-being\n2. Being\n3. Being within non-being\n4. Non-being within being\n5. Neither being nor non-being\n\nNeither being nor non-being is the wondrous qi.\nNon-being within being is the essential qi.\nBeing within non-being is the primordial qi.\nBeing is the original qi.\nNon-being is the mysterious qi.\n\nThe mysterious, original, and primordial qi, together with the essential qi, intermingle in wondrous harmony. Three within five, five within three—three and five blend without hindrance or harm. Goodness is perfected without rejection, and all are collectively named the Source of the Dao. The source fundamentally has five aspects, corresponding to the five directions: north (water), east (wood), south (fire), center (earth), and west (metal).\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth unfolded, before the five directions were distinguished, the qi of water, wood, fire, earth, and metal harmonized. At the extreme of resonance, response follows. Response aligns with the subsequent chapter, and all things resonate in unison. In the midst of this, one seeks clarity: to distinguish from chaos, to loathe death and delight in life. Yet delight in life cannot generate itself, nor can the desire for distinction distinguish itself. At the extreme of resonance, the Dao responds with the One. The One is the child of the Dao, the original qi arriving first. Thus: \"The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two.\" Yang qi leads the chant, yin qi follows in harmony. The two qi depend on each other, arising from the original qi. Thus: \"The One gives birth to the Two; the Two give birth to the Three.\" Yin and yang unite, harmonious qi intermingles, and the Three give birth to the myriad things. The mysterious, original, and primordial qi divide, and thus Heaven covers above, Earth bears below, and humanity stands between. The myriad things array themselves, the Three Powers mutually assist, and all return to revering the Dao.\n\nThe Dao has three offices: above, the Heavenly Office; below, the Earthly Office; and in the center, the Water Office. The Dao entrusts these three offices without establishing separate duties. Things attach to the Three Powers without additional bureaus. Human officials are only three, mutually overseeing one another, guiding the branches back to the root. In broad terms, they are the same: drawing forth goodness and suppressing evil. In finer details, their methods diverge, yet divergence ultimately returns to unity.\n\nUnity resides in the Sage’s proclamations, which possess both provisional and real aspects. The discerning attain the truth. The essential purport of the true scripture takes wisdom as foremost. Concealing brightness and employing it in secret, the Sage’s virtue is perfected. Perfection arises from study and understanding; understanding arises from inquiry and investigation. Investigating principles to the utmost of one’s nature, one entrusts this to the superior person. The foundation of the superior person lies in recognizing the Three and upholding the Five. Those who know the Three and Five traverse the world without obstruction, wherever they go. The Three are yin, yang, and harmony—the mysterious, original, and primordial. The Five are water, wood, fire, earth, and metal.\n\nBefore the Three were distinguished, it was called \"Hun\" (chaos). Before the Five were manifest, it was called \"Dun\" (primordial simplicity). The source of Hun and Dun is depicted as follows:\n\n1. Inner name: *Yuan* (Source); outer name: *Ziran* (Spontaneity). This qi is most wondrous, supreme and without superior.\n2. Inner name: *Hun* (Chaos); outer name: *Wuji* (Ultimateless).\n3. Inner name: *Dun* (Simplicity); outer name: *Da Dao* (Great Dao).\n4. Inner name: *Qi* (Purity); outer name: *Zhizhen* (Utmost Truth).\n5. Inner name: *Jin* (Essence); outer name: *Taishang* (Supreme).\n6. Inner name: *Meng* (Obscurity); outer name: *Lao Jun* (Venerable Lord).\n7. Inner name: *Wan* (Stubbornness); outer name: *Gao Huang* (August Sovereign).\n8. Inner name: *Shi* (Beginning); outer name: *Tian Zun* (Heavenly Honored One).\n9. Inner name: *Yuan* (Origin); outer name: *Yu Di* (Jade Emperor).\n10. Inner name: *Xuan* (Mystery); outer name: *Bi Xia* (Beneath the Throne).\n\nThe ten names comprise thirty characters, each corresponding to the ten directions. They may be combined or used singly, similar yet distinct, for responses vary in degree. Thus, honorific names differ to awaken the good heart, using names to convey principles. Those who know them do not die; those who understand them attain longevity. When encountering the worthy, one should seal one’s lips and receive them; to the unworthy, be cautious not to proclaim them.\n\nThe *Supreme Cavernous Mystery Precious Origin Upper Scripture* concludes. #1 If not *Origin*, it should read \"Not *Origin*.\"",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Precious Origin Upper Scripture**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Precious Origin Upper Scripture*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties. One scroll. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Cavern Mystery Section, Original Texts Category.\n\n---\n\nThe *Supreme Precious Origin Upper Scripture*, also titled *The Wondrous Secret of the Source-One*, or *The Divine Decrees of the Five Emperors as Cultivated by the Jade Dawn Lord of Zouqu*, is concealed within the Chamber of Great Possession and transmitted to the Supreme Perfected.\n\nThe Supreme Lord spoke:\nThe Great Dao is vast and boundless, within it lies treasure—its treasure most refined. None can proclaim its glory, for its glory is lush and dense; none can match its nobility, for its nobility is most revered. None can equal its gate, for its gate is unparalleled, its portal stands alone. If you can seek it, enter without desire; if you seek it with desire, none can attain it.\n\nWith few desires and aspiring admiration, one’s resonance varies by degree. Modeling earth after heaven, abiding in the Dao’s spontaneity—spontaneity’s wondrous darkness responds to the Three Positions. The source of the Three Positions is one in essence; this essence stabilizes the void, forming substance through pattern. Inner and outer mutually require, merging into oneness. Oneness connects with the Three Powers; the power of humanity excels all categories. Harmonizing virtue with the Two Modes, it transcends the common. By recognizing the root source and preserving the endowment without loss, one eternally safeguards life.\n\nCultivating within the chamber, stillness deepens with concentrated thought. Beholding the wondrous as the sun, clarity comes and goes—dissolving the darkness of death. As the darkness of death gradually recedes, the darkness of life steadily lengthens. Attaining life without death is called \"obtaining constancy.\" Before constancy is achieved, one must constantly preserve awareness. Knowing constancy is called \"illumination\"; not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune. Misfortune arises from desire, greed and contention entangle, qi surges and thickens, karmic obstructions daily harden. The heart-spirit becomes confused, disasters and calamities entwine.\n\nWisdom awakens to this: restrain desire, refine the heart. Use purity to govern turbidity, rectitude to control deviation. Once deviation and misfortune depart, rectitude and fortune renew. To accomplish and to conceal—this is uniting with the Dao in truth.\n\nThe spontaneous Source-One responds to the myriad things as Three. The myriad things act and return through the Four Darknesses and Five Phases, circulating through the Six Voids, all returning to the ancestral One. The One is the Dao’s child: from it arises Two, from Two arises Three. Within the Three-in-One, numbers are boundless. One, two, three, four, extending to five and six—what the scholar cultivates is to diminish desire. With desire diminished and selfishness reduced, the Dao may flourish. Thus, the sagely perfected honor the One as master, serve the Two as teacher, revere the Three as friend, cherish the Four as companion, follow the Five as leader, and roam the Six as constancy.\n\nThese Six Constants must be harmonized and never separated.\nThe Five Leaders are the imperial banquets where thought and the Emperor convene.\nThe Four Companions are the sequences of darkness as their essence.\nThe Three Friends are the shared radiance of luminous brilliance.\nServing the Two is modeling the laws of heaven and earth.\nHonoring the One is revering the Dao Lord.\n\nThe Dao Lord is the mother-source of the Dao, abiding in non-action and profound stillness. This is what \"no desire\" illuminates, not what \"few desires\" practice. The practice of few desires is like a mother guarding her child; thus, advanced scholars revere the Dao Lord. Revering the Dao Lord is cultivating and preserving ritual. Modeling the laws of heaven and earth is practicing life-giving application. Shared radiance of luminous brilliance is observing day and night. The sequences of darkness as essence are acting and concealing in timely manner. The imperial banquets of thought and the Emperor are aligning with the king to establish merit. The Six Harmonies as constant communication are following the Dao to establish virtue.\n\nFollowing the Dao to establish virtue is guarding stillness, purity, and emptiness. Aligning with the king to establish merit is administering rewards and punishments in accord with the times. Acting and concealing in timely manner is speaking or remaining silent with restraint. Observing day and night is studying scriptures and inner contemplation. Practicing life-giving application is binding to the Dao’s lineage. Cultivating and preserving ritual is continuing the mysterious rank.\n\nContinuing the mysterious rank is accumulating learning and establishing merit, ascending the verdant steps in sequence. When the Dao and virtue are fully replete, one ascends to the ultimate mystery. Binding to the Dao’s lineage is building goodness in mutual generation, transmitting the enterprise to descendants, preserving the accomplished nature perpetually, and maintaining sacrifices without cessation. Studying scriptures and inner contemplation is reciting and chanting sacred verses, comprehending wondrous meanings, visualizing spirits with focused gaze, and uniting with the perfected. Speaking or remaining silent with restraint is acting when things align, ceasing when people forbid, persisting in adversity or ease, and nurturing correctness. Administering rewards and punishments in accord with the times is punishing deviation and aiding rectitude, illuminating the Dao to save the vulgar, restraining or promoting to achieve the mean, without obstinate certainty. Guarding stillness, purity, and emptiness is operating through non-action, non-action without stagnation, the Three Palaces at leisure, the Five Spirits at peace.\n\nFollowing the Dao to establish virtue is adapting to the absence or presence of things, attaining carefree wandering. Cleansing one’s own discernment, the mysterious observation is fully encompassing. Coming and going are not of the self; only the Dao is followed. Entering and exiting as things, merit and virtue do not depart.\n\nMastering these Six, one proceeds through the Three Scriptures.\nThe Three Scriptures are: the first to illuminate heaven, the second to illuminate earth, the third to illuminate humanity.\nThe Dao of humanity, the Dao of earth, the Dao of heaven—these are the Three Powers.\n\"Power\" means to裁 (govern) and to能 (enable): governing deviation to return to central rectitude, enabling the reversal of flowing ends to return to the root source.\nThe source is the Dao. The Dao’s origin is revered. Reverence is the human head, the ancestral root of accumulated goodness. When blockages open and passages connect, the Three Daos are collectively named \"One Root.\"\n\nThrough responsive transformation, forms diverge: the highest, clear and unobstructed, is exalted; the lowest, peaceful and compliant, is noble; the middle, harmonizing the two, is most revered. Reverence and nobility reach the highest—names differ, yet reality is one.\nThis \"one reality\" is neither dead nor alive, neither non-existent nor existent.\nThe differing names: the upper covers yet neither bears nor covers; the middle gazes comprehensively yet neither bears nor covers. From the beginningless midst of all-containing darkness, the Three naturally arise. They cannot be abruptly unified. The Three cling to existence, grasping at neither non-being nor being. Yet the powers have sharpness, dullness, and balance; understanding has beginning, middle, and end. The end sinks seeking stability, the middle floats praying for deliverance, the beginning soars hoping for tranquility. Thus, groups divide and categories gather.",

      "translated_text": "Within the gathering and division, there are the sharp, the dull, and the balanced. The great Dao cannot compel them—once a single impulse stirs their response, it shows them where to go. Flying, floating, sinking—each follows its own origin. Thus, it reveals the Qian to guide those of the flying kind, manifests the Kun to receive those of the sinking kind, and establishes the Ruler to govern those of the floating kind.\n\nThe sagely ruler joins virtue with Heaven and Earth, skillfully dividing and nurturing to form the Three Origins. Each of the Three Origins has its revered one, and each title is established through deliberation. The dead Heaven is called *Di*, Earth is called *Huang*, and humanity is called *Wang*. The *Wang* is what all living beings turn to and revere. The *Huang* is what the vast, dark-containing all look up to. The *Di* is what all things hold in highest honor. Later responses vary in degree, and transformations differ accordingly. Within the sinking there is floating, within the floating there is flying. The flying act as *Huangdi*, the nine lands bear the title *Wang*. These are all partial names. The first was *Huang*, then *Di*; *Di* and *Wang* are raised together, their forms adjusted with the times, arising from the nature of things. Yet the power of transformation remains in use. To seek their fundamental intent, one must not fail to understand clearly.\n\nTo understand the Dao of Heaven, follow my *Upper Classic*. To understand the Dao of Earth, follow my *Lower Classic*. To understand the Dao of humanity, follow my *Middle Classic*. The *Middle Classic* can illuminate—illuminating Heaven and illuminating Earth. Yet one who illuminates Earth and illuminates Heaven has not yet illuminated humanity. To illuminate humanity lies in the *Middle Classic*.\n\nHuman form spans a full measure, and what it practices is *ren*. Even if *li* and *yi*, wisdom and trust, are all cultivated, to model oneself on Heaven and follow Earth is still not to become fully human. To become fully human is to thoroughly embody the *Middle Classic*. The *Middle Classic* holds the true. The true spirit descends, descending to unite with one’s own spirit as a single body. Yet one body holds two spirits, two spirits dwell in one body, blended without separation, constantly preserved and unchanged—only then is one a luminous human.\n\nThe true spirit is the wondrous darkness of the great Dao, responding to impulses and drawing near, merging with one’s own spirit. Once merged, there is no further division. This spirit has been within one’s body from the beginningless past to the present. Now, with merit complete and full, this spirit meets the Dao. Dao and spirit unite as one, the body also aligns as one. In oneness, wonder is absolute—beyond what the eyes of mortals can see, hence called formless. Yet it is not without wonder. The sage perceives it, perceiving it and merging with it. To speak of perceiving after merging is to be luminously clear. Inner vision knows no outer—it is not like gazing inward from without. Perceiving wonder arises from desirelessness. With desirelessness, words are now forgotten. Once words can be forgotten, preserve the precepts and reduce desires. The teaching of daily diminution leads to truth. Those who attain it are genuine. The current of reduced desire turns toward the true Dao. Looking up, observe the heavens above; looking down, examine the earth below; then look within to illuminate the center.\n\nTo illuminate the center is to preserve the Three-in-One. To preserve the Three-in-One, first observe the patterns of Heaven, then examine the principles of Earth.",

      "translated_text": "Observing the patterns of Heaven follows my Upper Scripture. The patterns of Heaven are the Three Luminaries. To \"observe\" is to divine by the Three Luminaries. The Three Luminaries are the sun, moon, and stars. They traverse three paths, advancing through the armillary sphere and measuring instrument. The sun departs, the moon arrives, revolving without end. The year reaches Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, their movements ever a warning, revealing calamity and manifesting fortune. The Northern Dipper’s nine stars—two concealed, seven visible—bright and dim alternate, drawing from the dark ford, moistening and harmonizing the dark, giving birth and completion without end.\n\nObserving the odes of spring, there are sixteen chapters. Yang pitches and yin tones harmonize, blending and tuning. Following the twelve months, winter solstice begins the cycle. The establishment of spring, spring equinox, establishment of summer, summer solstice, establishment of autumn, autumn equinox, establishment of winter, winter solstice—these eight nodes converge, belonging to the eight sounds, mutually supporting and perpetuating. Observing the odes of summer, there are twenty expansive chapters. Fire assists wood as propriety, wood engenders fire as benevolence. Spring’s virtue lies in sprouting and nurturing, summer’s merit in fostering growth. Pitches and tones harmonize, the eight sounds resonate, the Three Luminaries are unobstructed, and the seasonal order is proclaimed. Gathering these monthly nodes is called a year, thus belonging to Heaven.\n\nHeaven, in its first chapter, divides into two: before the vast generation and nurturing, it advances to guide the nurturing of life. Earth, in its eighty-first chapter, unites into one: after the killing and storing, it retreats to avoid punishment and destruction. Without this advance and retreat, superiority and inferiority are proven. The superior is practiced by the wise and sagacious, the inferior by the foolish and blind. This contrast stirs awakening, rousing the deluded. Those who comprehend grow daily in discernment. The storing of killing may be primordial, the nurturing of life may be unified. One descends into number to demonstrate and fix names for things. Names cannot be exhausted, nor are they bound by number. Thus, they reside within the five nines yet extend beyond the four nines. From ancient times to the present, their names do not depart. Therefore, the Upper Scripture has thirty-seven chapters.\n\nExamining the principles of Earth follows my Lower Scripture. The principles of Earth are the Three Colors. To \"examine\" is to await the Three Colors. The Three Colors are earth, mountains, and water. Surveying the five directions and the heavenly stems and earthly branches—positions of *jia-yi*, *bing-ding*, *wu-ji*, *geng-xin*, *ren-gui*, *zi-chou*, *yin-mao*, *chen-si*, *wu-wei*, *shen-you*, *xu-hai*—these twenty-two form the autumn odes, stern and distinct, without mutual confusion. Next are the nine provinces: Yu, Yan, Qing, Xu, Yang, Jing, Liang, Yong, and Ji. The Five Peaks are Mount Tai, Mount Heng, Mount Hua, Mount Heng, and Mount Song. The Four Waterways are the Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Ji Rivers. The Four Seas encircle the land, mountains, and waters, branching into twenty-two stems and twenty-two chapters as winter odes. Kunlun stands at the center, anchoring the four seasons. Forty-five chapters belong to Earth. Ascribing merit to Heaven, yielding and deferring upward, the Lower Scripture thus has forty-four chapters.\n\nThe source divides into the Two Modes of Heaven and Earth, named the two halves. Within these two halves, the dark sequence has four phases: first, true yang, the spring dark generating; second, yang within yin, the summer dark growing; third, true yin, the autumn dark killing; fourth, yin within yang, the winter dark storing. The four seasons cycle, and the year’s work is complete. The Three Luminaries revolve, and Heaven’s virtue is manifest. Thus, the Upper Scripture has spring and summer, benevolence and propriety, wood and fire, harmony and clarity. The Lower Scripture has autumn and winter, righteousness and wisdom, metal and water, compliance, sincerity, and trust. Earth pervades all, uniting in one scripture. The two scriptures establish positions, eternally illuminating the Two Modes, each with upper and lower, marking the four seasons.\n\nThe text of five thousand characters exhausts the Five Phases. Generation and nurturing are endless, virtue and merit unite. Number culminates in nine. The four seasons follow Heaven, multiplying in sequence: four nines are thirty-six. Thus, the *Dao Scripture* has thirty-six chapters. The Five Phases adhere to Earth, multiplying by Heaven’s method: five nines are forty-five. Thus, the *Virtue Scripture* has forty-five chapters. Heaven and Earth’s dark intermingles, two nines multiply: nine nines are eighty-one. Therefore, the two scrolls have eighty-one chapters.\n\nHeaven has eighty-one palaces, Earth has eighty-one domains, humans have eighty-one divisions, each with its numinous spirits. Through unity, the Dao is attained; attaining the Dao, spirits are communicated. Following Earth to model Heaven, Heaven acts without acting yet nothing is left undone. Yang initiates, yin responds. Earth achieves no merit, ascribing virtue to Heaven. Heaven divides the first chapter to clarify the intent of reward and completion, without desire or action, opening the path of eternal life and deathlessness. Earth unites the final chapter to illustrate the virtue of modesty and yielding, not harming with profit, magnifying the transformation of supreme virtue’s non-virtue.\n\nAll things do not desire yet are naturally upright, do good yet do not contend. Not contending, good is accomplished. Good is accomplished through mysterious reward. Rewarded with modesty, knowing the end yet guarding the root, the mysterious vision is flawless, its defense supreme. Thus, those who study this are called Supreme Perfected Ones. To study the method of the Supreme, one observes the patterns of Heaven above and examines the principles of Earth below.\n\nThe root of Heaven and Earth is formless. The formless is the Dao. Responding to things, it becomes being, having form and name. Naming Heaven and Earth, they are the Dao’s grandchildren, the One’s children. The Dao gives birth to the One, primordial qi. The One gives birth to the Two: internally called yin and yang, externally called Heaven and Earth. The Two gives birth to the Three: internally called harmony and qi, externally called humans. The Three gives birth to the myriad things. Yin and yang intermingle, the three qi distribute, bestowing according to kind. The myriad things array themselves. Humans receive abundant harmony and qi, thus \"the Two gives birth to the Three.\" The three qi are vast and generous, yet humans cannot be the parents of the myriad things. Therefore, they share Heaven and Earth as parents. The ruler of humans is most noble, called the Son of Heaven, the One’s grandchild, the Dao’s great-grandchild.",

      "translated_text": "Those possessed of the Dao and virtue are fit to serve as national teachers; the Son of Heaven honors them, and all refer to them as \"great-grandsons.\" The form of Heaven draws from the formless; when the One attains the power of generation, no form surpasses Heaven in grandeur. Embracing the One without parting, thus the character for \"Heaven\" (天) contains \"One\" (一) and \"Great\" (大). The formless gives birth to the formed, and the formed returns to the formless. The origin is taken as father, sustenance as mother. When the mother’s virtue endures and harmonizes, qi and things coalesce. Once things form, they ascend; Heaven inhales them, drawing them in with vast receptivity—like Heaven itself. Its pronunciation is glossed as *xiān* (先, \"first\"), also as *diān* (颠, \"summit\"), and as *xuán* (玄, \"mysterious\"). *Xuán* signifies suspended emptiness, mirrored above all things, standing at the forefront of all life—hence it is called Heaven.\n\nEarth is *tǔ* (吐, \"to spit forth\"), extending in three dimensions, manifesting above and below, giving birth to all things—like spitting forth. It is also called Earth. Its pronunciation is glossed as *dǔ* (睹, \"to behold\"), also as *lì* (隶, \"to serve\"), and as *qí* (齐, \"equal\"). Vast and great, it matches Heaven in virtue. Submissive and reverent, it supports and upholds, drawing things to behold its majesty. Humans and all beings emulate it: yielding, tranquil, harmonious yet not assertive, humble in success, never claiming achievement. Noble and base, before and after—its order is distinct, upright yet not deviant. It governs chaos, guiding all gradually back to Heaven—hence it is called Earth.\n\nHeaven’s patterns are clear and bright; Earth’s principles are tranquil and level—this is their constancy. When clarity fails, portents arise; when obscurity spreads, anomalies appear—this is not their constancy. Such extraordinary signs are not the work of Heaven and Earth; they serve as warnings to all beings, rewarding good and punishing evil, manifesting the extraordinary. These arise from humans losing the Dao, failing to model themselves on Earth, acting recklessly in violation of Heaven. Heaven and Earth send forth omens and anomalies as admonitions. By gazing above and examining below, one interprets portents and observes omens. Each omen has its cause; cultivating virtue and establishing merit dissolves them. If one can reform, abandon evil, and follow only the good, one models Earth’s steadfast tranquility.\n\nWhen the time arrives for movement, move in accordance with Heaven. To move in accord with Heaven is to move into the Dao. The path into the Dao lies in embracing the One. Embracing the One without deviation, the Three Ones become clear. One who clarifies the Three Ones unites with the Dao in truth. The perfected person studies this, firmly preserving the Three Ones. The Three Ones are Heaven One, Earth One, and Human One—also called the Upper, Middle, and Lower Three Primordials, or the Mysterious, Original, and Grand One.\n\nHeaven One resides in my *Upper Scripture*; Earth One in my *Lower Scripture*; Human One in my *Middle Scripture*. The *Middle Scripture* contains inner contemplation, each with its own distinct text. The reason there are three scriptures is that they arise naturally from the Three Qi. The wondrous qi of the Great Dao contains Three within One: yin-yang harmony, the Mysterious-Original-Beginning, and the Upper-Middle-Lower—all arising spontaneously. None can make them so, nor prevent them from being so—hence they are called the Natural Three Qi.\n\nThe *Upper* and *Lower Scriptures* also have their own texts. The reason the text comprises five thousand words is this: the Dao generates the Three Qi, the Three Qi generate the myriad things, and all things ultimately return to the One Dao. At the beginning, these Three Qi unite. The Five Numbers are established thus: the Dao’s One Qi is not yin-yang harmony but stands above the Three Qi. The myriad things’ One Qi is also not yin-yang harmony but stands below the Three Qi. Below the Three Qi, there are Three in the coarse; above the Three Qi, there are Three in the subtle. Subtle qi is colorless; all colors derive from it to take form. Coarse qi has color, but its colors are chaotic and obscure. Obscurity awaits the descent of the subtle to attain clarity. Clarity and obscurity cycle through the Three Qi in operation. Through their hidden and manifest workings, the Five Positions are established. Heaven and Earth, the Two Modes, operate through the Three Qi. One transformation reaches its limit at ten; ten transformations reach their limit at a hundred; a hundred transformations reach their limit at a thousand. When numbers reach their limit, they transform—but transformation does not exceed Three. The Three Essences reside in the Dao; beyond that, they reside in things. The myriad things transform into coarseness; to seek essence, return to Three. The Three transform to benefit things, and the Five Natures are completed—hence the text’s five thousand words, its principles all-encompassing.\n\nThe principles have a beginning and an end; the text has its sequence. The reason *\"The Dao that can be spoken\"* is placed first is to present the source in order to encompass the branches. *\"Without desire\"* and *\"with desire,\"* along with *\"good\"* and *\"evil,\"* are divided into two chapters because without desire, one perceives the subtle and attains long life, while with desire, one is mired in the coarse and meets death. Life and death arise from the human heart; the heart’s wisdom determines superiority or inferiority—this clarifies the broad outline, hence their placement in sequence. The subsequent details concern good and evil. Good and evil can be stilled, opening the way for the active mind. The active mind cannot be stilled all at once, nor can one immediately ascend without desire. For those who desire to be without desire, few desires bring little knowledge; knowing good as not-good, one forgets it to still desire. The method for stilling desire begins with reducing affairs. The essence of reducing affairs is to seek substance and discard ornament, eliminating falsity—hence the next chapter is *\"Not exalting the worthy.\"*\n\nTo discard exaltation saves the俗; hence the next is *\"The Dao is empty yet in use.\"* All things, without exception, are born and die, never enduring. Only the eternal abides. The eternal Dao has no ancestor, no predecessor; its transformations follow the times, boundless and infinite. In the beginning, when simplicity prevailed, it practiced the teaching without words. Later, when shallowness spread, words and images were mutually displayed. Those close in sentiment fail to grasp distant intent, often mired in words and images, sinking into delusion. Thus, the first chapter first dispels names and words, so one may know the eternal is not exhausted by names and words, yet the eternal is attained through names and words. Names and words are not the eternal’s essence. The root is quiescent, its responses active—truth and falsity differ. Expediency and reality, the myriad wonders, all emerge from the Mysterious Gate. Yet sentient beings, since beginningless time, possess mind and consciousness. Consciousness does not perish; the body undergoes death and life. The suffering of death and life torments the consciousness. One moment mixed, the next separate—endlessly entangled. Without severing the bonds, courageously transcending the multitude, and diligently accumulating merit and virtue, none can escape the pain of birth and death.\n\nThe pain of birth and death arises from emerging from non-being into being. Deep desire binds one in karmic fetters. To sever desire is to be without desire; slight goodness brings rebirth. Rebirth brings joy, attachment, and clinging. Love and desire follow one another; unable to sever them, one fails to broadly cultivate goodness. Sloth and doubt arise; evil roots flourish. Good deeds remain unaccomplished, and the pain of death returns. Lifespans are brief, yet anxieties and fears extend—all stemming from desire. Thus, the text first clarifies *\"without desire\"* and *\"with desire.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The calamities of desire lie in good and evil—each captivating the heart differently, their excesses solidifying into disaster. To abandon evil and embrace good, yet remain unclear on what constitutes good and evil, is to invert perception, allowing beauty to disorder the spirit. What one deems beautiful may not be good; even when good is recognized, it may still deviate from the Dao-heart. The Dao-heart shuns attachment, embracing reality and abiding in truth, without vain aspiration or competitive striving. Silently, it nurtures latent cultivation, free from alarm or doubt. Trusting and yielding to the Three Treasures, it conceals wisdom and forgets merit. Those who can do this may proceed toward the Dao. Thus, after the chapter’s opening on the three transformations, it clarifies the emptiness of the Dao and its application. Yet the Dao has no form or shape; words and images serve only as渡津. Having spoken of its emptiness and function, one realizes that its function is truly without substance—this \"substanceless substance\" existed before the Emperor.\n\nWhat follows the Emperor should model itself on the later to return to the prior. Hence, the next section elucidates the Heavenly Sage as worthy of emulation. All should emulate the Sage, yet emulating the Sage is not achieved through physical strength but requires the spirit’s diligent refinement, advancing daily, before one may ascend the mysterious peak. The spirit must not be disturbed, so the next section speaks of the Valley Spirit. Nurturing the spirit leads to the realm of deathlessness; the marvel of deathlessness is to merge with the Dao. Merging with the Dao makes one the root of Heaven and Earth; as the root of Heaven and Earth, one unites with them. Such union, though ashamed to save beings through fixed methods, attains effortless realization. Thus follows the section on *\"Heaven’s duration, Earth’s endurance.\"* The fruit of endurance arises from gentleness and compliance, so next comes *\"The highest good is like water.\"* Water, when added, fills and overflows; when stilled, it becomes clear and reflective. Thus follows *\"Hold it and it is full.\"*\n\nThe essence of not being full lies in achieving success and withdrawing. The dwelling of withdrawal is the realm of non-duality, so next comes *\"Bear the soul and embrace the One.\"* Embracing the One perfects mysterious virtue; mysterious virtue engenders without claiming, and beings naturally turn to it. Thus follows *\"Thirty spokes share one hub.\"* Beings honor the One’s function of emptiness; emptiness values formlessness. Yet the desire for form is hard to eliminate, so next comes *\"The five colors.\"* Shedding external flourishes reveals inner truth. Stop when it is time to stop, act when it is time to act—movement and stillness serve as teachers. One must hold office in the world, discerning when to advance or retreat. Thus follows *\"Favor and disgrace.\"*\n\nWhen both favor and disgrace evoke alarm, ascent and descent proceed without hindrance. Guarding against calamity without slack, myriad blessings renew. Rising from low to high, the world entrusts itself to such a one. Entrusted by the world, one must embody the Dao. The Dao’s marvel is formless, so next comes *\"Look for it and it cannot be seen.\"* Knowing the Three-in-One, wielding the ancient to govern the present—wielding the ancient to govern the present, one becomes a Sage-King above, a Sage-Minister in the middle, or a Sage-People below. Sagacity arises from accumulated goodness, so next comes *\"The good scholar.\"* The scholar is one who serves; all, high and low, serve through goodness. The good scholar embodies the ancient while studying the present. When present study aligns with the ancient, stillness is preserved without deviation. Thus follows *\"Attain utmost emptiness.\"*\n\nKnowing constancy aligns with the Dao, one may move left or right, up or down, as king or duke. United with Heaven and the Dao, one ensures lasting security—hidden yet unharmed, manifest yet unendangered. Losing this Dao, virtue becomes graded in excellence, so next comes *\"The highest.\"* This chapter on the *\"Highest\"* marks the boundary of spring’s verses, bridging the upper and lower sections, shifting the numerical progression. The *\"Highest\"* becomes the beginning of summer’s verses, aligning *\"Utmost Emptiness\"* as the sixteenth’s conclusion.\n\nThe response of the *\"Highest\"* is birth, nurturing, and maturation—maturation marked by the year’s end. The celestial stems and lunar phases align with light and shadow; form and spirit rest upon Kunlun. *\"Lun\"* signifies the pivot of transformation and guidance, ensuring longevity and deathlessness—hence its place in the *\"Nurturing\"* chapter. *\"Kun\"* signifies blending and returning to truth—hence its place in the *\"Birth\"* chapter. Inner concealment and outer tranquility ensure no danger or harm; peace and security endure, whether hidden or manifest. Few in the world can uphold this, so next comes *\"When the Great Dao declines.\"* Losing the Dao, one competes in ability, exalting external pursuits, yet returning to inner cultivation. Thus follows *\"Abandon sagacity.\"*\n\nCultivating the inner self, one shines without dazzling. Teacher and disciple practice humility and silence, dispelling misfortune and averting calamity. Thus follows *\"Abandon learning.\"* With external competition stilled and no inner strife, vastness encompasses all. Thus follows *\"The capacity of great virtue.\"* Enduring humiliation and dwelling in lowliness without complaint, one’s abiding is the Dao. Thus follows *\"Bend and be whole.\"* Bending yet remaining whole is the principle of nature, graspable in the heart yet indescribable in words. When numerical progression is exhausted, one avoids it; upholding silence expands it. Thus follows *\"Sparse speech.\"* Sparse speech and silent awareness uproot the sprouts of vain longing, so next comes *\"The forked path does not stand.\"* Without self-aggrandizement, one is deemed Dao-possessing. The Dao of the Dao-possessing existed before Heaven and Earth, so next comes *\"There was something undifferentiated.\"*\n\nThe undifferentiated holds the prior position; response and transformation follow. Divided into the Four Greats, the Four Greats have their directions. Successive teachings descend, prizing stillness as the foundation. Thus follows *\"Gravity is the root of lightness.\"* Gravity and stillness attain the center; external pursuits leave no trace. Salvation and aid exclude nothing; teacher and disciple harmonize. Thus follows *\"Good conduct.\"* Teacher and disciple united in the Dao know hardness and softness. Softness and hardness complement each other, returning to simplicity. Simplicity does not remain forever undifferentiated; when its course unfolds, it disperses, then reunites. Thus follows *\"Know the masculine, hold to the feminine.\"* Mastering both masculine and feminine, one aids governance and leadership. Attaining the center, abandoning extravagance, and embracing effortless action, thus follows *\"Desiring to take the world.\"*\n\nAs simplicity disperses and disorder arises, one is compelled to govern. Governance must not rely on military force, so next comes *\"Use the Dao to assist the ruler.\"* When compelled to act, one acts with merit; upon success, one retreats—never clinging. Thus follows *\"Fine weapons.\"* Probing the inauspicious and abandoning it aligns with the Dao. The Dao’s essence is withdrawal; in withdrawal, no doubt remains. Doubt dispelled, the world cannot be subjugated. Kings and lords in office do not pride themselves on superiority or monopolize profit; beings naturally submit. Thus follows *\"The Dao is eternally nameless.\"* One who enables beings to submit naturally unites virtue with Heaven and Earth. Sweet dew descends, and the world attains great peace. The cause of such an encounter lies in self-knowledge. Self-knowledge leads to contentment; contentment ensures no loss. Thus follows *\"To know others is wisdom; to know oneself is enlightenment.\"* Entrusting transformation to hidden radiance, the spirit merges with the Dao—appearing and vanishing freely, responding to stimuli without constraint. Thus follows *\"The Great Dao flows everywhere.\"* It responds to beings without fixed method; its attainment lies in...",

      "translated_text": "The earth is the earthly form of heaven; virtue is the responsive manifestation of the Dao. All things proceed by degrees, their forms appearing as those of humans. Should humans awaken and cultivate this supreme virtue, their virtue ascends to unite with heaven, and in turn, reunites with the Dao. Thus is the *Dejing* named, with \"supreme virtue\" as its beginning, for the beginning guides all that follows. Those who attain the Dao never lose it, and this is called \"virtue.\" Virtue has grades—superior, middling, and inferior—each expounded in breadth, arranged in necessary sequence. Some advance by leaps, others by gradual steps, each according to their own method. Now, following the ancient model, the text proceeds with \"of old, those who attained the One.\"\n\nThe One is the master of response; as master of the One, it responds to the myriad things. All things have their origin, and that origin is the One, which ought to be preserved. Preserving it without wavering, one’s movements oppose the vulgar. Opposing the vulgar, one returns to the Dao. Thus follows: \"Reversal is the movement of the Dao.\" Reversal is the path; the central path is most easily traversed. Hence follows: \"The highest scholar, hearing of the Dao, diligently practices it,\" for they must reach the source. The source ought to be known, so next comes: \"The Dao gives birth to the One.\" Knowing the One as the primordial source, preserving harmony, one accords with it. Thus follows: \"The softest under heaven,\" for softness is humility and non-contention. Those who contend for merit and fame lose their bodies and scatter their spirits. Hence follows: \"Which is dearer, fame or life?\" Vastly guarding the Dao leaves one insufficient in the eyes of the vulgar, so next comes: \"Great perfection seems flawed.\" Flaws are false, while wholeness is true. Removing calamity and welcoming fortune, thus follows: \"When the world has the Dao.\" The Dao is present everywhere; inward contemplation and self-examination yield it in the heart. Hence follows: \"Not leaving one’s door.\" Leaving one’s door to seek gain is coarse and contrary to the wondrous. To urge awakening to this, next comes: \"In the pursuit of learning.\" The flowery can be abandoned; desires must be diminished to attain the true. Accord with things, overcome obstacles, and do not cling to stubborn emotions. Thus follows: \"The sage has no constant heart.\" The heart responds to stimuli; when stimuli arise, it responds—not by seeking, but without desire. Flowing freely without fixed direction, in movement and stillness, only the Dao responds. The form of this response is called \"sage.\" Those who study the Dao and accumulate virtue are also called sages. Though the two sages differ in origin, they converge in unity. Unifying the heart to aid others, they guide the living and deliver the dead. The dead may reform; repentance restores life. The living may cultivate; nurturance ensures immortality. Life and death depend on the nine orifices and four gates, hence follows: \"Coming into life, entering death.\"\n\nThose who wish for life amid death must recognize the source. Thus follows: \"The Dao gives birth to them.\" Seeking life, one attains life, yet life’s affairs are manifold. Affairs have beginnings and ends; to govern them, one employs methods. Opening and closing have their proper ways, so next comes: \"The world has a beginning.\" The beginning ever illuminates the end; illuminating the end ensures perpetual opening. Intervals rely on clarity to aid progress, hence follows: \"Causing me to be steadfast.\" Those who can walk the great Dao shine inwardly while concealing their light outwardly. They delve to the root and secure the stem, ensuring endless descendants. Thus follows: \"What is well planted cannot be uprooted.\" Cultivating the self to the utmost extends to all under heaven; embracing the Dao preserves one’s authenticity. Hence follows: \"Those who contain profound virtue.\" Silently recognizing and diligently following, preserving it without loss, thus follows: \"Those who know do not speak.\" The speech of non-speech speaks to save others, dispelling evil and quelling disorder. Hence follows: \"In governing the state, rectify it.\" Ultimately, non-action is prized, and the proliferation of laws is not displayed. Thus follows: \"Its governance is dull and dim.\"\n\nThe past is boundless, the future endless, and the present without limit. For those who were good in the past, one reflects and studies to rescue oneself. For those who were not good, one aspires to deliver them, ascending together to the Dao’s realm. The future is endless, its subtleties and coarseness unfathomable; one must not treat it carelessly. The present is without limit, with high and low intermingling. The good establish goodness, drawing others to share in it, ascending together. The evil are transformed, all crossing the bridge of the Dharma. Thus follows: \"In governing people and serving heaven.\"\n\nAutumn’s songs differ, yet difference is not goodness. One must not usurp position; convergence and communication are essential. Though there are two chapters, they remain within the bounds of five and nine, guiding toward long life and enduring vision, without further division. Those who can deeply root and firmly secure the stem may aid others in spirit. Thus follows: \"Governing a great state.\" Virtue having converged, stillness brings peace to the small. Hence follows: \"A great state flows downward.\" Where does the flow lead? It leads to the great Dao. Thus follows: \"The Dao is the refuge of the myriad things.\" Knowing this refuge’s subtlety, one saves the multitude of the coarse. One must not act as though it exists, so next comes: \"Act through non-action.\" Ceasing action, one prevents gradual encroachment. Thus follows: \"Its tranquility is easily maintained.\" Commanding steadfast cultivation of virtue, verifying it through the ancient masters, hence follows: \"Of old, those who were good at practicing the Dao.\" Practicing the Dao has many methods, but the essential lies in humility and weakness. Humility nurtures the self; weakness is put to use. Enduring without loss, the small can become great. Thus follows: \"The rivers and seas.\" Guarding this humility, the vulgar cannot bear it. Hence follows: \"All under heaven say I am great, yet seem unworthy.\" Possessing the three treasures, one averts death and preserves life. Thus follows: \"Those who are good as scholars do not contend.\" Such virtue matches heaven, and heaven harms nothing. Hence follows: \"On the use of arms, there are sayings.\" Compassion and sorrow are the foundation; with the foundation established, the Dao is achieved. Few can understand this, so next comes: \"My words are very easy to know.\" The common people do not preserve their allotted place, falsely claiming ignorance as knowledge. Thus follows: \"To know yet seem not to know is superior.\" The foolish lose the Dao, unable to fathom the divine. Not knowing reverence, they offend and invite disaster. Hence follows: \"The people do not fear authority.\" The common people cling to their hearts, unable to practice non-action. They do evil but not good, emboldening their misdeeds. Thus follows: \"Brave in daring.\" Not attaining the proper object of bravery, hence follows: \"The people constantly do not fear death.\" The above transforms the below; the below’s transgressions stem from the above’s influence. Thus follows: \"The people’s hunger.\" Life takes food as its foundation, and the foundation takes the Dao as its master. The master teaches through softness and weakness. Hence follows: \"A person’s life is soft and weak.\"",

      "translated_text": "Within weakness lies strength; weakness can strengthen the Dao. Those whose Dao is strong attain harmony, and harmony resides within. Thus follows: \"The Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow.\" Harmony, softness, and weakness can overcome coarseness and rigidity. Taking proof from reality, thus follows: \"Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water.\" Contending in strength breeds mutual enmity and entanglement, while coarse harmony falls short of non-contention. Thus follows: \"Harmonizing great resentment.\" Without resentment, one is perpetually good, and the Dao of Heaven accords with them. Ever diminishing and reducing, they then preserve the great and abide in abundance. Thus follows: \"A small state with few people.\"\n\nWorldly discourse delights in ornate words, flowery yet insubstantial. The trustworthy words of the Dao are plain yet not embellished. The wise choose substance and discard ornament. Thus follows: \"Trustworthy words are not beautiful.\" This chapter, together with the Sage’s non-accumulation, clarifies that the more one gives to others, the more one ultimately returns to Heavenly virtue. Thus, \"beneficial yet not harmful\" is the pinnacle of the human Dao; \"acting yet not contending\" is the virtue of non-contention. Few can fully embody this, hence the need for guidance—enticing, leading, and instructing—to ascend from below to the heights, to turn the lowly into the exalted, and to abandon stagnation and evil in favor of smoothness and goodness.\n\nAll this derives from the Five Thousand Characters. Five thousand characters in fivefold arrangement: when the five virtues are fully realized, the absence of even a single word leaves the principle incomplete. This is the root of the Dao, born of the Great Void. Void yet not void, within nothingness lies being; within being lies wondrous invincibility. It nurtures all life, the root of ceaseless generation. It is called the formless chaos, without shape or appearance. The appearance of the shapeless cannot be grasped by thought; thought arises from language, and language conveys meaning. Yet meaning cannot be confined to language, nor can terse language exhaust meaning. Meaning lies beyond language, and the discerning delve deeply into it. By grasping one corner, they infer the other three—this is the mark of the wise and virtuous.\n\nThe qi of the Dao is mysterious and wondrous, without ancestry or precedence, without beginning or origin, without limit or end. It is desireless and thoughtless, actionless and effortless, pure and clear, tranquil and serene. Neither pure nor turbid, neither increasing nor diminishing, it embraces and contains the immeasurable. All existence and non-existence—its wondrous qi cannot be defiled, its mysterious form cannot be described. Forced into words, it is called the Dao, named the Formless. Within the formless, all forms are contained; all forms intermingled are called the Primal Unity. From this unity, all things are born, countless and boundless.\n\nBroadly divided, it is commonly expressed in five aspects:\n1. Non-being\n2. Being\n3. Being within non-being\n4. Non-being within being\n5. Neither being nor non-being\n\nNeither being nor non-being is the wondrous qi.\nNon-being within being is the essential qi.\nBeing within non-being is the primordial qi.\nBeing is the original qi.\nNon-being is the mysterious qi.\n\nThe mysterious, original, and primordial qi, together with the essential qi, intermingle in wondrous harmony. Three within five, five within three—three and five blend without hindrance or harm. Goodness is perfected without rejection, and all are collectively named the Source of the Dao. The source fundamentally has five aspects, corresponding to the five directions: north (water), east (wood), south (fire), center (earth), and west (metal).\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth unfolded, before the five directions were distinguished, the qi of water, wood, fire, earth, and metal harmonized. At the extreme of resonance, response follows. Response aligns with the subsequent chapter, and all things resonate in unison. In the midst of this, one seeks clarity: to distinguish from chaos, to loathe death and delight in life. Yet delight in life cannot generate itself, nor can the desire for distinction distinguish itself. At the extreme of resonance, the Dao responds with the One. The One is the child of the Dao, the original qi arriving first. Thus: \"The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two.\" Yang qi leads the chant, yin qi follows in harmony. The two qi depend on each other, arising from the original qi. Thus: \"The One gives birth to the Two; the Two give birth to the Three.\" Yin and yang unite, harmonious qi intermingles, and the Three give birth to the myriad things. The mysterious, original, and primordial qi divide, and thus Heaven covers above, Earth bears below, and humanity stands between. The myriad things array themselves, the Three Powers mutually assist, and all return to revering the Dao.\n\nThe Dao has three offices: above, the Heavenly Office; below, the Earthly Office; and in the center, the Water Office. The Dao entrusts these three offices without establishing separate duties. Things attach to the Three Powers without additional bureaus. Human officials are only three, mutually overseeing one another, guiding the branches back to the root. In broad terms, they are the same: drawing forth goodness and suppressing evil. In finer details, their methods diverge, yet divergence ultimately returns to unity.\n\nUnity resides in the Sage’s proclamations, which possess both provisional and real aspects. The discerning attain the truth. The essential purport of the true scripture takes wisdom as foremost. Concealing brightness and employing it in secret, the Sage’s virtue is perfected. Perfection arises from study and understanding; understanding arises from inquiry and investigation. Investigating principles to the utmost of one’s nature, one entrusts this to the superior person. The foundation of the superior person lies in recognizing the Three and upholding the Five. Those who know the Three and Five traverse the world without obstruction, wherever they go. The Three are yin, yang, and harmony—the mysterious, original, and primordial. The Five are water, wood, fire, earth, and metal.\n\nBefore the Three were distinguished, it was called \"Hun\" (chaos). Before the Five were manifest, it was called \"Dun\" (primordial simplicity). The source of Hun and Dun is depicted as follows:\n\n1. Inner name: *Yuan* (Source); outer name: *Ziran* (Spontaneity). This qi is most wondrous, supreme and without superior.\n2. Inner name: *Hun* (Chaos); outer name: *Wuji* (Ultimateless).\n3. Inner name: *Dun* (Simplicity); outer name: *Da Dao* (Great Dao).\n4. Inner name: *Qi* (Purity); outer name: *Zhizhen* (Utmost Truth).\n5. Inner name: *Jin* (Essence); outer name: *Taishang* (Supreme).\n6. Inner name: *Meng* (Obscurity); outer name: *Lao Jun* (Venerable Lord).\n7. Inner name: *Wan* (Stubbornness); outer name: *Gao Huang* (August Sovereign).\n8. Inner name: *Shi* (Beginning); outer name: *Tian Zun* (Heavenly Honored One).\n9. Inner name: *Yuan* (Origin); outer name: *Yu Di* (Jade Emperor).\n10. Inner name: *Xuan* (Mystery); outer name: *Bi Xia* (Beneath the Throne).\n\nThe ten names comprise thirty characters, each corresponding to the ten directions. They may be combined or used singly, similar yet distinct, for responses vary in degree. Thus, honorific names differ to awaken the good heart, using names to convey principles. Those who know them do not die; those who understand them attain longevity. When encountering the worthy, one should seal one’s lips and receive them; to the unworthy, be cautious not to proclaim them.",

Thus follows: \"Brave in daring.\" Not attaining the proper object of bravery, hence follows: \"The people constantly do not fear death.\" The above transforms the below; the below’s transgressions stem from the above’s influence. Thus follows: \"The people’s hunger.\" Life takes food as its foundation, and the foundation takes the Dao as its master. The master teaches through softness and weakness. Hence follows: \"A person’s life is soft and weak.\"",
