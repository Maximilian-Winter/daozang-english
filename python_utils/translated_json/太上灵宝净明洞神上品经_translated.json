The Supreme Primordial Azure**\nThe Supreme Ultimate is without peer; the Great Net begins in azure.\nWithin it dwells the Perfected, neither dying nor living.\nThe Most Honored in Heaven is called the Three Clarities.\nIn the Jade Clarity Palace resides the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning.\nIn the Highest Clarity Palace resides the Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure.\nIn the Grand Clarity Palace resides the Celestial Worthy of Dao and Virtue.\nThese are the Three Radiant Ones, each with their Perfected.\nThey have their stewards and ministers, left and right chancellors.\nJade lads and jade maidens, keepers of scriptures and scribes,\nScholars of the registers, who explicate texts and transcribe records.\nLaw officials and censors, with the central minister overseeing all.\nThe Lord who governs the cosmos is the Jade Emperor.\nHe receives the mandate of the Three Clarities and inspects the Purple Tenuity Court.\nThe attending officials receive the decrees of the Three Clarities.\nThe Purple Tenuity Court is the pivot of the hundred spirits.\nMinor matters are handled directly; major affairs are reported upward.\nThe Jade Emperor’s palace establishes the regulations.\nThe attending ministers correspond above to the Three Clarities.\nBeyond these, there are further ranks, each with its name.\nThe Northern and Southern Dippers are the Lords of Life and Death.\nTo the left is the Grand Tenuity, to the right the Lesser Tenuity Lord.\nThe Dark Capital governs judgments, the Celestial Pivot maintains the records.\nThe seventy-four bureaus are the officials of speech and tongue.\nThe general recorders and clerks investigate and discern the good.\nThis is called the Assembly Bureau, the Five Ministries of the Shangshu.\nThe Grand Tenuity, Lesser Tenuity, and Dark Capital governors—\nThese are the Three Departments, the Six Offices.\nThe altar adjudicators are likewise numbered.\nKnowing their names and ranks can lead to awakening.\nThose who cultivate our Dao may correspond to these ranks,\nAttending the Jade Emperor’s court with the Three-Five Flying Steps.\n\n**2. The Celestial Offices in Array**\nThe Great Dao governs all, the celestial offices arrayed in majesty.\nThe stars of the celestial offices pay homage to the Emperor’s realm.\nThose who cultivate our Dao ascend to the Jade Emperor.\nTheir ranks and stations thus transcend the mundane and depart from the ordinary.\nSome hold civil ranks, others military offices,\nStanding in the left and right courts, adorned with golden pendants and pearl ornaments.\nThey attend the Jade Emperor’s chariot, serve beside the Purple Tenuity.\nSome oversee celestial bureaus as ministers of the various heavens,\nOfficials of the Left Sun and Right Moon, functionaries of the Twenty-Eight Constellations.\nAll are named Perfected, able to tread the flowing net.\nThe yellow, white, and black paths—one must grasp their mechanism.\nThose who know our Dao may ascend clouds with ease.\nWhat is the Golden Duke? What is the Wooden Consort?\nCultivating the real and refining qi, one attains the subtle and profound.\nResplendent in filial piety and fraternal duty, unwavering in loyalty and righteousness—\nEven without the great elixir, one may still awaken.\nThose with dharma-names ranked among the lofty, or who practice talismans, incantations, and healing waters to save the imperiled, are of the lower grade.\nYet none compare to those who, through filial piety, refine qi,\nServe both parents, nurture the body,\nAvoid corpse-liberation, and ascend to the real—\nThis is the filial path of refinement, which arrays them among the celestial beings.\nThe celestial path is not difficult; people make it so themselves.\nAttaining immortality is not difficult—\nOne must not endanger the body or offend the parents,\nThus benefiting others through goodness.\nThose who neither cultivate themselves nor serve their parents\nAre like the poor who crave gold.\nThe array of celestial offices neither easily nor arduously records names.\nNeither easy nor difficult—this is the essence of the supreme Dao.\nAs for those who seek spirits through ritual audience,\nThis is not easily understood, yet all arise from refining the form.\n\n**3. The True Grades of Entering the Dao**\nAt the beginning of human life, the body is inherited from the parents.\nKnow what to nurture, know what to honor.\nKnow what to serve: the bodies of parents are the bodies of Celestial Worthies.\nThose who serve their parents invite the descent of the Celestial Worthies’ numen.\nTo worship the stars, one must first honor siblings—\nThe bodies of siblings are the Perfected of the various heavens.\nThose who understand this may burn cinnabar talismans,\nAnd a hundred ghosts will fear their names.\nThose who do not understand this cannot enter the Dao to serve the Three Clarities;\nYakshas will devour their flesh, demons will slaughter their spirits.\nEven with ten thousand scrolls of elixir scriptures, they cannot ascend to the real.\nWith ten thousand boxes of talismans, they cannot command ghosts and spirits.\nA hundred demons and ten thousand monsters, all manner of spirits,\nWill laugh and seek to devour them.\nWhen they die, Fengdu will examine and punish them,\nSubjecting them to a hundred mutilations and a thousand tortures, again and again.\nHow could their souls become immortals in the Southern Palace?\nThe Perfected loathe to hear their names,\nCovering their noses and stopping their ears, gnashing their teeth in refusal.\n\nOnly those who understand loyalty and filial piety may study the Dao—this Way is easily known and not difficult to practice. To repent and awaken to the Dao is the highest goodness. To transform unfilial conduct into filial piety is to fulfill perfect filiality. Perfect filiality is not difficult: correct your errors as soon as they occur. If you once offended your parents, dare not offend them again. From this day forward, swear never to repeat such transgressions. Thus will the Celestial Emperor dispatch Perfected Ones to descend into the world, bestowing upon you the true oral instructions. Cultivate yourself and aid others, accumulating merit to become an immortal.\n\nThose who fail to awaken are like those who seek to cross a river without a raft—forever trapped in the wheel of rebirth, sinking into the realm of lesser ghosts.\n\n**Chapter Four: Entering the Dao and Cultivating the Self**\n\nThe Dao is utterly level, never inherently difficult. Yet delusion over right and wrong creates barriers, severing one from the great stream. Here lies the sequence for entering the Dao, the gateway to abandoning the mundane. There are cases where parents ascend together, husband and wife stand side by side. Anxious for their well-being, they practice filial piety, which is the essence of loyalty. This loyalty is rooted in the nature of the self, as steadfast as mountains. Yet ordinary people waver and falter, thus falling into peril. They treat the nurturing of qi lightly and neglect serving their parents. Their primordial qi dissipates, the great debt of gratitude fades away—how then can they serve their sovereign or fulfill the Emperor’s will? Thus their sins accumulate like the rivers, and the underworld officials will examine and punish them.\n\nAll you children of the Red Dust, heed my words. If I deceive you, may my eyes go blind, my ears deaf, my nose blocked, my mouth mute, my limbs paralyzed. May I never tread the Celestial Court or ascend upon the clouds. For billions of kalpas, may Fengdu subject me to its torments. But I pray that you, my children of the Red Dust, keep filial piety ever in your hearts. At home, serve your parents; in court, be loyal to your lord. Do not indulge in greed or lust, nor waste your essence. Then blessings from the gods will flow to you like a spring, naturally and ceaselessly.\n\nRecite this scripture day and night, and your soul and qi will naturally become numinous. If any among your kin suffer from illness or misfortune, it will naturally be resolved. If you dedicate this to wandering souls or stagnant spirits, they will escape the darkness of the underworld. With every recitation, the power of the Heavenly Worthy aids you. The Heavenly Worthy saves the people of the world, yet they remain ignorant of the principles of life. The Five Rebellions reside in their hearts, and when the Heavenly Worthy sees this, tears stream down like rain. It is not that the Heavenly Worthy abandons you—you must examine my sincerity.\n\n**Chapter Five: Cultivating the Self and Upholding the Teachings**\n\nThe Three Realms are scrutinized, as are the Five Peaks and the Three Officials. The Day-Patrolling Spirit Lords and the Ten Heavenly Demon Kings, along with the ledgers of sin and merit, the Central Pivot of Heaven’s Records—all are overseen. Seven assistants govern seventy-four subordinate bureaus, recording nothing too great or too small. At the Three Primes and Three Assemblies, reports are submitted to the Northern and Southern Offices. The Northern and Southern Offices determine the weight of deeds and report them to the Purple Tenuity. Lesser matters are sent to the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Twelve Palaces, and the Thirty-Two Heavens for separate judgment. Grave matters are personally conveyed to the Jade Emperor or adjudicated by the Three Clarities, their clarity like a mirror, their fairness like still water.\n\nThose who cultivate our Dao achieve completion through upholding the precepts. Serving one’s parents forms the marrow; refining the body forms the flesh and skin. Saving others is like a single hair; merit and virtue are one’s garments. If one is greedy for wealth, lustful, treacherous, or venomous—cast them down. If the heart craves meat, remember: another’s wealth is like the king’s grain—you must not hoard it. Another’s wife or daughter is like your own mother or daughter—you must not lust after them. Another’s goodness you must respect and never harm. Even the beasts and the six livestock—regard them as your children and endure not to eat their flesh.\n\nThus, if I wish to study immortality, the true youth must perfect the Ten Goodnesses and fulfill the Five Blessings. In life, become an immortal of the earth; in death, enter the Golden Chamber. No longer consume fire-cooked food or the Five Grains. Your soul will reside in the Vermilion Mound, undergoing refinement and preservation. You will tread the Jade Void, and the immortals will be your companions.\n\n**Chapter Six: Upholding the Teachings and Cultivating the Real**\n\nThe study of the Dao has its foundation; the ascent to immortality has its ladder. Only by knowing the secret instructions can one penetrate the mysteries. The body will then have nothing to be ashamed of, and the heart nothing to doubt. In non-action and solitude, meditate in the stillness of night. The spirit lords of the five viscera will one by one take flight, ascending to the Central Pivot and the Bureau of Essential Matters. With no transgressions to record, your merit will be evident.\n\nBy day, absorb the essence of the sun; by night, consume the fluid of the moon. Refine your hun and po, and you will naturally benefit. Your spirit will soar to the Three and Five, ascending to the Celestial Pole. Naturally, your name will reach the Heavenly Chief. The Lords of the North and South will present your name and your person before the Celestial Court. The Gates of Heaven will not dare to obstruct you; the hundred officials of the Central Pivot will welcome you. Thus, you will first receive immense blessings, and later accumulate primordial merit. You will inscribe talismans to summon rain, command clouds and winds with a shout. In life, you will be granted true office from afar; in death, you will rightfully enter the lineage of immortals. You will not fall into evil destinies nor be bound to the underworld bureaus. Your body will become a true lord of the upper heavens, overseeing the affairs of the lower realms. Above, you will illuminate your nine generations of ancestors, who will also ascend to the boundless. Below, you will shelter your nine generations of descendants, all endowed with immortal potential. They will know no cold or hunger, and blessings will naturally follow.\n\nDo not keep my words secret or prevent others from knowing them. Teach my children of the Red Dust to correct their errors and abandon their wrongs. Recite this scripture to ascend to the real. Whether you are a king or an emperor, it will dispel weapons and war. Whether for parents, siblings, or kin, it will plant the seeds of past affinities. Whether for the deceased, it will deliver their corporeal forms. All will attain their desires and follow the inclinations of their hearts. If your heart does not waver, you may study the Dao. You who study the Dao, reverently uphold my teachings.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Ascending to the Real and Recognizing the Spirit**\n\nThose who study the Dao and ascend to the real will ride clouds and fly upward. Heavenly scriptures will descend, and immortal palaces will welcome them. Who are these immortal officials? They are the various Perfected Ones. Twin dragons pull their chariots; mighty warriors bear their standards. Before them, heralds clear the way; behind them, celestial soldiers guard. Jade lads and jade maidens hold the seals and sashes. Silver-eared attendants transmit the Emperor’s commands. In this, there is no fear, no alarm. Naturally, your hun and po will undergo refinement in the Vermilion Mound.\n\n**The Vermilion Mound’s Great General wields flowing-gold fire bells.** Entering the celestial realm, Heaven has four gates. The Eastern Florescence Gate is governed by its overseers. Within presides the Sovereign of the Day’s Duty, the Primordial Lord. Within presides the Adjudicator, the Venerable Recording Deity. Within presides the Gatekeeper, the Vajra Warrior. Three Perfected Immortals inquire of your name, examine your transgressions, and rank your merits. Without error or fault, you may then enter. Two Recording Clerks escort you upward.\n\nThe Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper each have their True Lords. Once the Recording Clerks withdraw, the True Lords welcome you. In due order, they memorialize your ascent to the Purple Tenuity Court. At this moment, the Dao of immortality is achieved. Bowing to the Great Veil, the Primordial Jade Clarity, the Jade Emperor of the Luminous Heavens, and the Three Radiance Heavenly Worthies—these cannot be seen, only glimpsed in auspicious clouds. Jade lads transmit the decree, faintly audible. They bestow upon you cinnabar elixirs, golden pendants, and pearl tassels. Upon receiving them, you prostrate and dance in joy. True immortals will then instruct you in the rites of audience.\n\nThis scripture is truly wondrous, and thus its account is brief. Hold it in mind with care, lest you err or stray. Recite the true scripture ceaselessly, and divine officials will grant you elixirs, elevating you to heavenly rank.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Shallow Practice and Corpse Liberation**\n\nThose who practice the Dao shallowly may ascend as immortals through corpse liberation. Before death, they must possess good karmic conditions. When their kalpas of worldly dust are exhausted, their names are stricken from the registers of Mount Tai in the east and Mount Hua in the west. The Earth God’s divine lord dispatches two envoys to summon and guide their hun and po souls. At this time, you must firmly recall your karmic causes and, upon meeting the underworld officials, stand before the courts of the nether gates. Within lie tribunals and prisons, dreadful and alarming. Yet you must not fear; state your case directly, recount your karmic origins, and conceal nothing of your sincerity.\n\nIf your name is absent from the ledger of transgressions but present in the ledger of virtues, the True Lord of the Eastern Ultimate Who Saves from Suffering will question you with kind words, welcome you joyfully, and invite you to ascend in a jade carriage with four wheels. The attending deities on either side are as those in the ascent to reality. You must recognize their names and titles, for they escort your spirit to undergo refinement in the Vermilion Mound. Ascending through the ranks in due order, you wander freely upward, entering the gates of Heaven and the Purple Tenuity Court. Some receive elixirs, others true scriptures; jade lads transmit the edicts, just as in the flight to ascension.\n\nYour bones and flesh remain behind, a discarded form—like the molted husk of a snake or cicada, foul yet fragrant. Your children and grandchildren, burying you with utmost sincerity, may struggle to relinquish their love, for worldly attachments linger. At times, you may return for a visit, and your descendants will weep, unable to see your form. If at this moment you cannot yet sever your emotions, fix your thoughts on the dusty realm, neither entering the netherworld nor accepting the dust of mortality. Sever affection, abandon love, and establish the foundation of your Dao. Your children and grandchildren may yet benefit from this. Ascending beyond ignorance and bondage also serves as a ladder to immortality. The ladder to immortality lies before your eyes, yet people remain unaware.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Ranked Ascent and Registry Enrollment**\n\nThose who ascend through corpse liberation share the same Dao but tread different paths, all called transcendence, their names inscribed in the true registers. Some receive transmission in life and posthumous elevation; others are elevated only after death. There are those who receive transmission but are not elevated, but none are elevated without prior transmission. Some serve in the Celestial Pivot’s administrative offices, others in its furnishings and arrays. Each has their rank, emerging from the Supreme Beginning Azure. Some are recorded, some named.\n\nThe upper rank is defined by filial piety, the middle by bodily refinement, and the lower by salvation—all transcend worldly dust. The primordial net unfolds naturally, arranging ranks. Enrollment in the registry is simple, not cumbersome. The Left and Right Bureaus oversee the Most Wondrous Forbidden Altar. Within lies the Near Forbidden, the Purple Tenuity Azure Altar. Within lies the essential ground, the Golden Portal Crimson Altar. The Three Clarities’ attending ministers serve as left and right aides. The Thirty-Two Heavens also have their chief ministers.\n\nWithin the mundane realm, there are civil and martial officials, civil and martial meritorious deeds. Grand envoys, minor envoys, envoys of various titles. True Persons command armies, six offices with twelve divisions. The Supreme Emperor bestows grace, each receiving secret talismanic words. The fewer the words, the greater their value; their language is unadorned. They strike directly at your heart, leaving no flaw.\n\nCloud chariots and cloud horses belong to the Three Clarities’ domain. Like jade refined by carving, like gold freed from ore—those who can be molded into vessels do not fail. Those who are cast aside, rejected. All named upper immortals occupy ranks among the immortals. Civil and martial registers naturally distinguish them. The Most High’s methods are simple, requiring neither paper nor ink. Recite the true scripture ceaselessly, and your heart will not waver. Once your hun and po souls are adept, attainment comes naturally.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Ranked Enrollment and Graded Ascent**\n\nPeople advance in sequence: the upper study to penetrate reality, the middle accumulate conduct, and the lower strive to achieve merit. Some serve as pure officials in the Nine Palaces, others as minor clerks. Appointments are made according to ability, names recorded among the various armies. The Three Heavens’ River Source and the Six Treasuries’ officials and soldiers—regardless of strength or weakness, men or women—ceaselessly follow karmic conditions to attain this supreme cause.\n\nJade lads radiate brilliance; upper-ranked women are among them. Those of lower rank may serve as female soldiers. Some possess innate skills, others innate numinosity. Good causes arise from study, and study is perfected through precepts. Initially, observe precepts with caution, avoiding forced labor. Cultivate these arts and accumulate virtues. What is learned in life becomes strength after death. Cloud paths arrange ranks, and the netherworld confers offices. Each develops their strengths, naturally free from confusion.\n\nThose of higher virtue may lack ability yet possess it, lack knowledge yet know, lack awareness yet understand—this is the power of the ten virtues. Thus, some remain empty, nurturing themselves in tranquility, their names listed among the unassigned officials. The Supreme Emperor’s talismans descend, entrusting them with tasks for careful consideration. Some join the ranks of the forbidden and near, others serve as supernumerary officials. Some become jade lads, attending the Morning Ultimate’s imperial chambers. Others serve as attendants, hurrying through palace corridors. Some become warriors, their armor and shields radiating light. Upper generals hold rank, commanding troops on the march. Some serve as generals in charge, others as common soldiers in the ranks.\n\nThe Eight-Nine Blessed Lands, the Six-Six Grotto-Heavens.\nRivers and seas, mountains and peaks—each bears its name.\nRewarded according to merit, with not a hair’s breadth of partiality.\nThe Celestial Pivot’s registers record all who preside over affairs,\nscrutinizing ingress and egress, leaving no matter unchecked.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: On the Resolve to Cultivate the Dao**\n\nThose who attain the Dao must also cultivate resolve and learning.\nNeither partial nor crooked, they transgress not against perverse desires.\nEven a single stray thought brings the dark officials to examine and punish.\nThe celestial statutes and divine mechanisms arise from the subtle and obscure.\nThey fortify their forms, leaving nothing adrift or lost,\npreserving their long lives, never falling into the dusty world.\n\nThe people of the dusty world—emperors and kings, the hundred officials and noble kinsmen,\nas well as farmers—all below the heavens possess their own causes.\nAccording to their karma, they receive either nobility or poverty,\nlowliness or wealth, all issuing from the heart.\n\nThe gods of the various heavens are none other than mortals.\nWhen mortals cultivate the Dao, they become celestial gods.\nWhen celestial gods neglect cultivation, they are again bound to the dusty world.\nThrough learning, one avoids falling; by upholding precepts, one can follow the Way.\nAfter fifty myriad kalpas, one becomes the Venerable Heavenly Marshal Tianpeng.\nAfter twenty-four kalpas, one becomes the Perfected Martial General.\nAfter ten million kalpas, one becomes the Perfected Savior from Suffering.\nAfter fifteen kalpas, one becomes the Solar Attendant Yuanjun.\n\nThese are not transformed bodies but mortals of the world,\nwho die to become gods, ascend as immortals.\nThe celestial officials record their surnames,\nthe earthly officials register their names,\nthe aquatic officials note their merits.\nThe Celestial Pivot’s central bureau records their ranks and titles.\nThose with merit and no transgressions endure through kalpas without falling.\nAt the Three Primordials’ examinations, their names stand in extraordinary ranks.\nBy the Jade Emperor’s decree, their virtue and conduct are exalted.\nSuch great immortals are too numerous to record;\nI cite but one or two to convey my intent.\nAll later learners must cultivate resolve and learning without cease.\n\nThe heavens hold texts, the heavens hold registers.\nThrough them, one may establish merit or redeem sins.\nFortunate to possess this foundation, do not cast it aside.\nHungry ghosts and beasts are not distinct kinds—\neach arises from the sins committed by humans.\nThe hells of earth and heaven must not be taken lightly.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Heavenly Dao’s Secret Writings**\n\nAll who cultivate to become upper immortals must know their destination.\nThe heavens conceal names, the heavens conceal characters.\nThe Most High Three Purities: Kongtong and Chier.\nThe Jade Emperor and Purple Tenuity: Zhiyuan and Zhongzhi.\nThe Northern and Southern Dippers, recorded by the Three Terraces.\nZixin, Ziyin, Gengxu, Dingren, Zigui’s gods.\nMengshu, Mengliang, Zhongbao, Zhongqing,\nJiyu, Jiqian—these are the Two Courts.\nWithin the Three Terraces: Yunyu and Qijing,\nFengliang, Qingqi, the Four Sage Divine Lords.\nThe Greater Yang and Greater Yin, the honored stars of sun and moon,\nnamed Xuannü, the gods of the Five Phases.\nThese too have alternate designations:\nthe Water Star is called Yan,\nthe Fire Star Ying,\nthe Wood Star Miao,\nthe Metal Star Jian,\nthe Earth Star Zhen.\n\nThey oversee all authority, the Twenty-Eight Constellations,\nthe Thirty-Two Heavens.\nGonghua, Yaobo, Yangguan, Tangxuan.\nMuju, Zitai, Anaxuan, Danfa.\nChangjia, Zhihou, Gunteng.\nShajie, Nachou, Huifu, Yangzhen.\nThese are their concealed names, recorded in the *Scripture of Salvation*.\nAll lineages establish their standards, transmitting the orthodox wheel.\nQiaozi, Meijin, Shoushan, Teling.\nYueshi, Baojia, Fenglü, Zhuyan.\nBaipeng, Deshu—these are the scriptural stars.\nThe Five Stars arrayed as weft, each with its transformed body.\nThe master of the Celestial Pivot is called Daoling,\nencompassing earthly images, all serving as chief overseers.\nThe Five Peaks and Four Waterways each possess their mechanisms.\nAll are listed in the numinous books; reciting them dispels calamities,\nfor all ghosts stand in awe.\nThe names of the people of the Sand River do not escape its records.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: The Upper Grade of the Numinous Writ**\n\nDatu suqie juzhishe ni bodi pibishe po luo poqie nan Luji bonajielituo miding tise bo □ xiduo pidi nuchao he diye napanzhe sanmu bolaxini pijucha shuxina yedu yitan yangqiluo □ luobiji chituonili banliyeningtu □ chanluodu xuzhanponatuo yao □□ duo wangjia pila napanzhe modi shanzhe bochana du buzhishiduo na hu □ lu yongbo sidi tengbengqie fan abie baye chayu sheye yanqiduo mipan zha biyi yanjige yiqian yeqian zhibili yaochau wushifaluo shulan zhiduo dili lazhacha shizhiye nayebo shati weng shuoni shanaju zhitatu lu hu wu om judina luo daodi chana yunfeng junayou na hesulu natan jiaqing namilu gu banju heye xidan lai qimili pohe\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Lower Grade of the Numinous Writ**\n\nGuimi xiangshan dadai □ la piao lan zha zhening gu tu jue □ ying sui hao yin nian hua zu □ tian ku chun ru □ xia xiao kuai yin que lei zuan xian fu yi lan jiao wu kun he yue zhua lu cu lu □ mao nei □ kui shi ba mao yan shu niu wan □ zhui bing qi ji xian chi qu xie ge bao fen tan cui xian xue yi li zhu du da hong po miluo pohe om hulu weiyin modaoli ben xian kui gui xin he piao long □ na jinjin shana tongshe jiena fenglun huoche diju dahe fenghuo jiaojia fanyi weixiao jiuliang hengxiao yi zhi xie zhu xue xuan he li jian hong po zhizhina da li she sheyun mu di na feiqie podi yi poduo zhiquiluo zhi qita yidi luoyi dinan he he cha suoji nv he fenglun huoche\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Exegesis on the Numinous Writ’s Sanskrit**\n\n**The Primordial Vastness of the Most High**\n\nWithin the primordial chaos of the Most High, divine immortals dwell.\nAmong these immortals, ranks of great transcendents stand.\nThe constellations array in splendor, the Four Symbols encircle all.\nOriginally born in the human world, they cultivated the true canon.\nResplendent in achievement, they suddenly ascended in flight.\nThe Heavenly Emperor’s officials were commanded to bestow upon them seats at the banquet.\nThe Supreme Lord conferred names—*The Numinous Writ Concealing the Mysterious*.\nThe annals of the Numinous Writ govern the immortals’ dominion.\n*Tatha sugata*—this is their foremost.\nRecite but one chapter to dispel baleful karmic ties.\nHearing your invocation, they arrive in an instant.\nSome appear robed in cloud-like raiment, others with jade pendants chiming.\nSome manifest as Daoist adepts, others as officials of rank.\nSome take the form of mighty warriors, others as tiger-like guards.\nThey protect your recitation of scripture, whose meaning is profoundly abstruse.\nAbstruse beyond abstruseness—close your eyes and meditate in stillness.\nThe Thirty-Two Heavens ascend to true spirit-awareness.\nOnce soul and spirit are refined, you naturally enter the realm.\nI possess a treasure chart, and behind it, a treasure register.\nThose who practice this will naturally attain the Dao in full.\nThe method for refining form, the art of cultivating truth,\nThe medicine to save others, the blessings to teach them—\nAll begin with filial piety and fraternal duty, extending to aiding and assisting.\nThe radiance within Heaven, the essence within Heaven,\nThe elixir within Heaven, the flower within Heaven.\nAfter practicing this, you may attain them.\nRecite ten thousand times, and your body shall dwell in the Southern Palace,\nYour name heard by the Supreme Lord.\nRiding the wind, commanding the void, you shall move freely,\nNow west, now east.\nAmong later disciples, those who wish to listen and follow—\nLet them heed these words.\n\n**Chart and Register May Enter the Canon: Chapter Sixteen**\n\nAll young disciples of immortality must know how to concentrate the spirit.\nWhat is concentrating the spirit? It is transforming the body’s form.\nThrough this, one may refine and nurture, naturally ascending to truth.\nWhat is ascending to truth? It is recognizing the spirit.\nHow does one recognize the spirit? By obtaining my treasure chart.\nThis is the root of primordial qi, the guiding principle of its flow.\nThe medicine for ascending as an immortal, the method for ascending as an immortal—\nHow may one obtain them? What is their cause?\nWhat is their cause? Filial piety and fraternal duty toward the six relations.\nThose who practice filial piety may study my scripture.\nMy scripture is no ordinary text—it is the talisman of the Supreme Lord.\nWearing the talisman and pacing the chart, one suddenly rides the void.\nThe radiance of the sun and moon, the essence of the five stars—\nCombined, they form the elixir to nurture your form.\nThe sharpness of the sun and moon, the edge of the five stars—\nForged, they become a sword to protect your body.\nOnce the body’s form is firm, life and nature are at peace.\nThere is also a sacred talisman to repel ghosts.\nWhen ghosts and evil cannot invade, the Dao is accomplished.\nUse it to save the people below, to transcend life and death.\nThe offices of Heaven, the duties of Heaven,\nThe robes of Heaven, the sustenance of Heaven.\nIn your ears, immortal medicine; in your eyes, immortal flowers.\nRoaming freely in the heavens, you enter the home of the Three Clarities.\nWithin it are fixed officials, close ministers,\nThe honored ones of Heaven, the gods of Heaven,\nThe duties of Heaven—attain them, and your name is listed.\nAll young disciples of immortality, do not fail my teachings.\nPractice them with care, cultivate my supreme Dao.\nIf there are virtuous ones who study with sincere hearts,\nSwear an oath upon golden tablets, and invoke the gods in prayer—\nDo not recklessly pass these to others.\n\n**The Wondrous Treasure Chart: Chapter Seventeen**\n\nWhat is the treasure chart? The mechanism for ascending to truth.\nFace north with your back to the south, and visualize the star altar.\nHow high should the altar be? Nine feet and two inches.\nThe sun and moon to left and right, the two Dipper stars before and behind,\nThe Canopy above, with the Vermilion Bird,\nWhite Tiger, Azure Dragon, and Dark Warrior as one,\nQian, Kun, Gen, and Xun—each in their proper place without error.\nConcentrate the spirit and guide the qi, press the Mao character,\nClad in ritual robes as prescribed in the register.\nProceed directly to the gate, enter through the Ding Barrier,\nThree steps of the Ding Barrier, ascending one level of the altar.\nFrom the altar, move left, recite my divine incantation,\nAnd proceed straight to the Earth Gate.\nAgain, move left, recite my divine incantation,\nAnd enter straight through the Heavenly Gate—\nEntering the Heavenly Gate, as if there were immortals.\nTwo immortals, a Jade Lad and Jade Maiden,\nAttend to incense and convey words to guide you.\nKneel long, close your eyes, and if a divine being appears,\nRiding five-colored clouds, clad in the robes of the Upper Clarity,\nTransmitting the Jade Emperor’s talisman, calling your name—\nAnother will come forth, bearing a jade goblet,\nWithin the jade goblet, a nectar of jade mist.\nIn the Northern Dipper, a black qi;\nIn the Southern Dipper, a red qi;\nIn the sun and moon, that crimson qi, that white qi;\nIn the Canopy, the five-colored qi—\nFlowing into the cup, if you can receive it,\nBow twice and drink.\nRelease the mudra and descend the altar, circling right as you exit,\nReciting my incantation—naturally, there will be benefit.\nOn Gengshen and Jiazi days, at the Three Origins and Three Assemblies,\nPractice diligently, and the guiding principle of the primordial qi’s flow shall be revealed in full secrecy.\n\nThus concludes the *Upper Scroll of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Luminous Cavern Spirit Upper Grade Scripture*.\nHere begins the *Lower Scroll of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Cavern Spirit Upper Grade Scripture*.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Wearing the Precious Register**\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy saves the world;\nWear the register and enact the guiding principle.\nAscend three steps upon the altar,\nThen once more drink the misty nectar.\nDescend the altar, turn right to exit,\nPacing the Dipper to form the *kui* and *piao*.\nThe Six Stars cover your head;\nTurn your body to enter the Dipper’s mouth.\nStep by step, tread the colorless path,\nPass through *Ji*, revolve the Dipper’s *gang*.\nHaving traversed the Five Constants,\nYou drift serenely to the Emperor’s realm.\nThen you see the Golden Gate’s honored one—\nI have roamed the ten directions.\nDeparting heaven to receive heaven’s rank,\nSoul and spirit naturally find peace.\nShould you wish to know my precious chart,\nThe two scrolls will surely reveal it.\nShould you wish to know my precious register,\nThe register holds its true method.\nTake that Jade Emperor’s script,\nFace the Dipper and write with cinnabar.\nOn every *jiazi* day,\nInscribe it within your home.\nEach day ingest one passage,\nAnd naturally vital essence will flourish.\nWear it without parting,\nAnd you may become an immortal.\nThe immortal’s home is not distant—\nThe primordial guiding principle allows ascent to the farthest reaches.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: The Heaven-and-Earth Gate Incantation**\n\nWho can learn immortality?\nTo learn immortality, there is a method.\nThe immortal’s method is not difficult—\nIt lies within my precious chart.\nWear the register and enact the chart,\nAnd divine protection will naturally follow.\nBefore you is the precious register,\nWhich may be ingested.\nHow to wear it?\nFollow its methods and arts.\nBurn incense and visualize the altar,\nThe altar lofty and towering.\nAscend to invoke the spirits,\nDescend to pace the *gang*.\nEvery person’s soul\nMust have its secret incantation.\nWhat is this incantation?\nDaily, visualize the earthly gate.\nRecite this incantation:\n*\"The immortal’s path stretches vast,\nThe Primordial Beginning’s home.\nI wish to ascend the altar,\nTo purify the spirit and transform thoughts.\nMay I receive the Most High’s\nBestowal of flowing mist.\nThe mist’s nectar,\nSpreads qi in fragrant array.\nHaving ingested it,\nI may pace the *gang*.\nThe Five Viscera’s Spirit Lords,\nThe Fragrant Officials of the Day,\nHearing my secret incantation,\nEach finds peace.\"*\nAfter entering the Heavenly Gate,\nThere is also a secret incantation:\n*\"Supreme Great Luo,\nGreat Luo of Jade Purity.\nWithin the Jade Purity’s palace,\nThe Dharma-Perfected of the Degrees.\nHearing my secret incantation,\nTransmit my bodily form.\nTake that jade mist\nTo purify my spirit.\nNow I pace the *gang*,\nProceeding to the Emperor’s realm.\nProceeding to the Emperor’s realm,\nI ascend to meet the Jade Emperor.\"*\nAfter reciting the secret incantation,\nDescend from the stellar altar.\nIts incantations are contained\nWithin the two scrolls of the numinous scripture.\nWithin the numinous scripture,\nThe names of the hundred spirits.\nThe thirty-two heavens,\nThe twenty-five divisions.\nThe governing spirits\nAll come to welcome.\nThe guiding spirits\nRevolve and encircle.\nAscending to the Golden Gate,\nThere is the Supreme Mystery.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: The Roster of Summoned Spirits**\n\nThe *Scripture of Pure Brightness*\nIs the origin of all methods.\nPracticing it has its Way—\nCommanding ghosts and spirits.\nDispelling illness and misfortune,\nSummoning rain and moving clouds.\nTo transcend life and death,\nTo save the myriad people.\nEnacting the precious chart,\nWearing the register and pacing the *gang*.\nWhen the Dao is fulfilled and merit complete,\nYour name is recorded in the Emperor’s realm.\nWhat spirit would not obey?\nWhat ghost would not conceal itself?\nThere is the Capital Marshal,\nThe Capital Envoy.\nThere are the outer and inner altars.\nThe inner and outer altars\nCommand thirty-six generals.\nSeizing ghosts, shackling ghosts,\nBinding ghosts, interrogating ghosts.\nDisheveled *yakshas*,\nYellow-headed jailers.\nThere is the Wheel of Fire,\nThe Four Directions’ Majestic Virtue.\nThe Numinous Officer Five Lords,\nThe Twelve *Yakshas*.\nThere are the Patrols,\nThe Illuminating Seizers.\nThe Swift Seizers,\nThe Soul-Pursuers.\nSuch generals\nEach have their deputies.\n*Qianyuan Hengli*,\n*Tucha* and *Guotian*.\nSummon the living souls,\nAnd the dead souls.\nFurther, there are thunder chariots,\nAnd the Thunder Department.\nEach has its regulation by the Heavenly Pivot,\nAnd its station in the *gang*’s domain.\nThe method of their use\nHas its own summons.\nEach has its summons—\nThe sound follows the qi’s arrival.\nQi and spirit intersect,\nAnd they naturally appear before you.\nThey may be commanded,\nThe heavenly generals and officers.\nEach has its tally of troops,\nDream and sleep revelations,\nUnfailing in their timing.\nThis is called the essential art\nOf the *Three-Five Flying Steps*,\nThe *Luminous Cavern*’s method of commanding ghosts and spirits.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Three-Five Flying Steps**\n\nThe *Three-Five Flying Steps*\nAre the essence of the flowing guiding principle.\nHeavenly Hero, Heavenly Task,\nHeavenly Pillar, Heavenly Heart.\nHeavenly Bird, Heavenly Auxiliary,\nHeavenly Impulse, Heavenly Interior.\nReaching Heavenly Peril—\nThese are the seven transformations.\nCorresponding above to heaven,\nLike that primordial guiding principle,\nIt is the utmost subtlety.\nThe Three Terraces’ six steps\nEmerge from the Dipper’s mouth.\nThe seven-sevens’ number,\nLeftward circling to form fire—\nThis is called the True and Orthodox.\nEastward nine-nines,\nTo complete the Great Yang.\nWestward eight-eights—\nThis is called the Great Yin.\nRight revolving then left,\nLeft then right revolving,\nAltogether seven reversals.\nLeftward proceeding east,\nTo traverse the ten directions.\nThe ten directions’ stars,\nThe twenty-eight lodgings.\nEach lodging’s *ding-gang*,\nTwelve in number.\nFrom *Ji* revolving the Dipper,\nThe Dipper revolving into *Ji*,\nDirectly facing the Great *Piao*.\nLeftward revolving south,\nForty-nine steps—\nThis is called crossing blades and doubling the Fire Star.\nPassing through the Great Yin,\nSix-sixes’ steps,\nCompleting the Water Lodging.\nFrom Water eastward,\nTo the side of the Great Yang.\nLeftward forming Wood,\nSixty-four steps.\nRevolving again—\nThis is the *Wu-Ying*.\nThe Duke’s Son offends Water,\nBorrowing the *gang* to reemerge beside the Moon.\nThis becomes the Metal Star,\nThe White Prime Honored Spirit.\nProceeding minutely to the center,\nReaching the Dipper’s mouth.\nThirty-five steps\nTo complete Earth.\nFrom Earth, the qi’s summation,\nBorrowing Metal’s *gang*.\nReturning to the Water Lodging,\nEntering the Wood Chronogram.\nFacing north,\nEight steps and eight luminaries,\nTo pay homage at the Heavenly Gate.\nThe *Three-Five* method\nIs but its essential outline.\nExpanding it further,\nIts reckoning does not exceed the *Three-Five*’s number.\nThus,\nYou may summon the spirits and command them.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Facing Heaven to Meet the Emperor**\n\nThe *Eight Luminaries of Heavenly Hero*\nAre all called *Facing Heaven*.\nThe Three Purities’ Supreme Emperor,\nThe Purple Tenuity’s Dark Heaven.\nKnock the teeth five times—\nAll appear before you.\nNothing is not made clear,\nNothing is left unspoken.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis is what is called *Stepping the Dipper to Face Heaven*.\nIt can cure illness and avert misfortune,\nIt can nurture the true and cultivate practice,\nIt can fulfill one’s utmost filial piety,\nIt can command ghosts and spirits.\nThe Four Saints of Heavenly Torch,\nAnd all the Perfected of every rank,\nNone fail to come in welcome.\nAt this time, Heaven bestows numinous elixir:\nTo the left, seven bonds form the Lord of the Sun;\nTo the right, seven slayers form the Lord of the Moon.\nSwallowing and breathing—\nThis is the true elixir.\nThere is the odd, there is the even,\nThere is the yang, there is the yin.\nThe elixir of yin and yang,\nWhen ingested, grants long life.\nSome attain extended lifespan,\nSome achieve liberation through *shi*-transformation and become Perfected.\nSome gain penetrating vision,\nAble to scrutinize the hundred spirits.\nThe secret of Heaven’s Center,\nThe scripture of Heaven’s Center,\nThe office of Heaven’s Center,\nThe duty of Heaven’s Center—\nEach is attained within the body,\nNot necessarily through a master’s transmission,\nBut arising from Heaven’s completion.\nWhat is Heaven’s completion?\nThe method of *Facing Heaven*.\nThrough it, one may wondrously enter the Supreme,\nAnd naturally reach the *Beginning Azure*.\nAt this time,\nThe Ten Heavenly Demon Kings,\nThe Great Gods of Long Life,\nThe True Emperors of the Five Directions,\nGuard and protect one’s form.\nLike the sun and moon,\nThe longer they endure, the brighter they grow.\nLike the Five Phases,\nThey wheel and turn without cease.\nSome attain the ascension of parents to Heaven,\nAnd blessings of prosperity for descendants.\nThis is truly the *qi* entering the *Mystery of Mysteries*.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Cultivating Merit to Achieve Reality**\n\nWho does not desire to attain immortality?\nStudy immortality in youth.\nIn youth, serve with loyalty and filial piety,\nAccumulating long practice to form a root of goodness.\nMoreover, perfect the *qi* and blood,\nAscending and descending within the cinnabar field.\nHold talismans to cure others’ illnesses,\nAnd hidden virtue may transcend the ordinary.\nCultivate practice using my method—\nWhat worry is there of not ascending to Heaven?\nI possess the *Scripture of Purity and Luminosity*;\nRecite it to learn loyalty and filial piety,\nAnd refine the bodily form.\nSpiritual luminaries come to assist,\nAnd thus one may cure a hundred illnesses.\nThrough this, initiate the primal merit,\nAnd one may reach the realm of immortals.\nEscape the gate of afflictions,\nEnter the realm of clarity and brightness.\nRiding the cloud of the mysterious crane,\nOne naturally soars through the void.\nShould one wish to command ghosts and spirits,\nThey will follow like child servants.\nThe *Six Jia* and *Six Ding*—\nThis method emerges from their origin.\nCultivate merit to achieve reality,\nAnd through this, refine and polish.\nNaturally, one obtains my method,\nAnd within a hundred days, sees ghosts and spirits.\nHow does one assist the Supreme Emperor?\nHe dispatches them to aid you.\nIf you are good at upholding the Dao,\nEven the various demons and devils\nWill wish to pay homage to you.\nThis is due to the quality of loyalty and filial piety,\nAnd the preservation of true *qi*.\nHaving merit among the multitude,\nOne ranks among the immortals’ assembly.\nThose who cannot practice this Dao\nWill find it difficult to obtain the method.\nEven if one obtains my method,\nThis art will not be efficacious.\nIf loyalty and filial piety are not in the heart,\n*Qi* and blood are lost for the sake of profit.\nThe Dao of immortality grows ever more distant,\nObtaining the method is like steaming sand.\nSteaming sand to make rice,\nExpending effort, yet it cannot be cooked.\nThough there is the heat of fire and *qi*,\nIt cannot be eaten.\nAmong the various immortals of the Southern Palace,\nNot one has been heard of who is unfilial.\nPractice filial piety to study immortality—\nStudying immortality should be easily accomplished.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Praise and Concealment of Secret Standards**\n\nThe Supreme Emperor arranges offices,\nThe officials of the various heavens.\nThe true offices of Heaven’s officials,\nEach possesses its wondrousness.\nAccording to what one has studied,\nHe rewards with secret characters,\nCombining them into fine appellations,\nTo perfect the Supreme Dao.\nServing both parents with devotion is called *filial piety*.\nRespectfully serving the lord is called *loyalty*.\nHarmony with elder brothers and friendship is called *fraternal duty*.\nAmity with relatives is called *harmony*.\nNurturing one’s nature and life is called *authenticity*.\nComprehending the canonical teachings is called *Dao*.\nDiligence in rectifying the mind is called *virtue*.\nCommanding ghosts and spirits is called *sageliness*.\nAchieving utmost sageliness is called *divinity*.\nClarity in perception and understanding is called *wisdom*.\nWisdom that radiates forth is called *numinosity*.\nVirtue and conduct that do not change are called *stability*.\nStability that does not change is called *responsiveness*.\nDiligence in upholding the Dao and its methods is called *reverence*.\nAdherence to precepts and regulations is called *conduct*.\nVirtue sufficient to radiate forth is called *manifestation*.\nManifestation that does not waver is called *radiance*.\nRadiance of great brilliance is called *excellence*.\nRefining the hun and po souls is called *purity*.\nCommanding without selfishness is called *resoluteness*.\nCollecting many numinous scriptures is called *assembly*.\nSubstance that may be employed is called *pattern*.\nVirtue and conduct that are not deviant are called *verification*.\nUniversal love without weariness is called *benevolence*.\nBeauty that may be praised is called *excellence*.\nPossessing all good affinities is called *fruit*.\nReverence without weariness is called *solemnity*.\nSuch categories as these,\nNumbering in the thousands or tens of thousands,\nAre all contained in the canonical texts.\nThose who study the Dao,\nDiligently practice them,\nAnd thus the praise and concealment of secret standards\nArise naturally from within.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Jade Regulations and True Mechanism**\n\nThe true essentials of the Jade Regulations,\nThe *Purple Court* and the *Ghostly Azure*.\nThere is natural meaning,\nThere is natural clarity.\nDiligently cultivate the Orthodox Teaching,\nAnd the Great Dao is accomplished.\nObscured and deluded,\nEvil fills to overflowing.\nPurity without defilement is called *purity*.\nVigilance and apprehension are called *diligence*.\nDesire that is not yet attained is called *authenticity*.\nCovetous desire that is not yet attained is called *authentic covetousness*.\nTaking what is not to be taken,\nStealing what is not stealing,\nLust that is not lust,\nRebellion that is not rebellion,\nCompliance that is not compliance.\nCompliance and rebellion, rebellion and compliance,\nGood and evil, evil and good.\nRepentance and awakening to study the Dao\nAre called *supreme goodness*.\nAffectation contrary to the Dao\nIs called *great evil*.\nLife that is not true life,\nKilling that is not true killing.\nConcealing goodness is corruption,\nHiding evil is deception.\nKilling yet wishing for life—\nThis is called *love of life*.\nSeeing and wishing to kill—\nThis is called *love of killing*.\nThose who resent their parents\nCannot obtain life;\nThough they live, they may be killed.\nThus, the truly filial do not die,\nThe utmost filial attain immortality.\nThe Dao of immortality is easy,\nThe way of ghosts is difficult.\nGoodness is the constant of good people,\nEvil is the pretense of evil people.\nGoodness, through habitual practice, may become evil;\nEvil, if not evil and reformed, becomes goodness.\nThus, those who reveal arrogance receive reward,\nThose who secretly accumulate meet execution.\nUsing pretense to encourage goodness is called *sincerity*,\nUsing honesty to gloss over faults is called *deception*.\nYin transgressions are great,\nYang transgressions are small.\nTransgressions arising within yet not revealed—\nThe offense is already grave.\nActs performed outwardly yet accompanied by shame—\nThe offense is already absolved.\nDo not suppress others’ goodness;\nThose who suppress others’ goodness turn their backs on the Dao.\n\nThough seizing another’s goodness, those who seize goodness turn toward the Dao.\n\nHeaven’s light emerges from earth,\nFire illuminates human radiance—\nA mirror by which one may know.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: Penetrating Knowledge of Past Lives**\n\nIllumine the true without obscurity,\nPenetrate knowledge of past lives.\nAttain former habits,\nTo cultivate good roots.\nWithout error or fault,\nStudy the divine immortals.\n\nWhat is the Dao of immortals?\nWhere the numinous nature reaches.\nOnly through penetrating knowledge\nCan one attain the mysterious precepts.\nThe mysterious precepts are most clear—\nBehold my former studies.\nWith those former studies,\nOne may repeatedly transgress,\nOne may repeatedly achieve,\nAnd naturally become true.\nBecoming true is not difficult,\nAttained only through learning.\nThrough eternal kalpas unchanged,\nTrue knowledge unconfused—\nThis is penetrating knowledge.\n\nFrom that penetrating knowledge,\nOne reaches penetrating spirit.\nFrom that penetrating spirit,\nOne can achieve penetrating vision.\nWhat is called *penetrating*?\nDark and light all discerned,\nBright and obscure unshaken—\nThis is supreme wisdom.\n\nThe spirit soars in threes and fives,\nRoaming and feasting among the heavens.\nAbove the heavens,\nEach has its true person.\nThe arts of the true person\nAre most clear in meaning.\nPurify the viscera,\nNurture the essence-spirit.\n\nThe medicine of nature,\nTalismans and incantations most efficacious.\nThere is the celestial drum—\nStruck, it resounds mightily.\nThere is the jade spring—\nDrawn, it overflows.\nThe coming of the jade spring,\nThe nectar of the flower pool,\nIts essence like honey,\nIts flavor most true.\n\nSwallow and rinse, sound the drum,\nSix by six, complete the cycle.\nTo preserve my spirit,\nBathe in the moon, wash in the sun.\nSun and moon now bright,\nHeaven and earth illuminated.\nThe myriad forms unfold,\nThe spirit-soul transcends.\n\nThis is the clarity of penetrating vision,\nBy which to examine ghosts and spirits.\nIt can illuminate ten thousand miles,\nIt can illumine one’s own body.\nGuarded by ghosts and spirits,\nIt reaches the subtle and obscure.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Reviving the Dead and Restoring Life**\n\nSpittle eases cultivation,\nStroking qi to unite with spirit.\nThe Five Celestial Great Demons,\nAncestors of the ten thousand spirits.\nSummon them to return—\nWithin, there is a true person.\nPreserve life, secure its root,\nGather and guide the hun and po souls.\nReturn them to their dwelling,\nUnshaken, unagitated.\nControl them so they do not scatter—\nWithered trees bloom anew.\n\nChaos and obscurity merge,\nConverging in the mud-pill palace.\nWithin the mud-pill palace,\nIt connects to the crimson palace.\nThe spirit of the crimson palace,\nReturning, reverts to the true.\nThus, dry bones\nMay live again,\nAll rising to become human.\n\nAt this time, there are:\nThe Demon Mud,\nThe Dharma Ancestor,\nThe Return to True,\nThe Bewildered,\nThe Profound Net—\nEnvoys of the Five Celestial Heavens,\nKnown as Zhao, Meng, and Wu.\nThey command the flying hun and soaring po ghosts,\nSummoned by secret formulas,\nDirected by methods.\nAs the sovereign of the body,\nThey are the Dharma Kings of liberating the dead.\n\nThere is also the upright qi,\nSpread within and without.\nWithin and without now harmonized,\nIt reaches the joints.\nUnshaken, unagitated,\nSuddenly, one attains it.\n\nThen recite the incantation:\n*True Person of Reviving Life,\nTrue Person of Saving from Suffering.\nSpittle eases cultivation,\nUnite qi to merge with spirit.\nHun and po souls return again,\nThe register of death removes the name.\nThe Five Celestial Great Demons,\nLiberate the corpse’s form.\nLet so-and-so live again,\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.*\n\nAs for the secret formulas for the eyes and joints preserved in the esoteric texts—\nIf one encounters a person of karmic affinity,\nThey may receive and uphold them.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Underworld’s Examination of Forms**\n\nOn Mount Fengdu,\nThere are prisons and cells.\nA Great Emperor Lord\nPresides over its judgments.\nTens of thousands of demonic nets,\nExamine and punish evil ghosts.\nHundreds of thousands of deaths,\nDying and being reborn.\nThrough kalpas of cyclic rebirth,\nThey become the six livestock.\n\nAsking the reason—\nAll due to lack of filial piety.\nThe five rebellions of unfilial conduct\nStem from the root of the heart.\nA foolish heart unrepentant\nSoon becomes disobedience.\nDisobedience and unfiliality\nTransform into disloyalty.\nGreed for wealth, greed for beauty,\nGreed for wine, greed for lust.\nFrom these causes and conditions,\nMany misfortunes arise.\nOffending yin and yang,\nProvoking heaven and earth.\nThe twelve double-hours\nRecord their transgressions.\nReported to the celestial court,\nThe celestial court issues its decree.\nDelivered to the celestial pivot,\nTheir hun souls are bound,\nAfter death, entering Fengdu.\n\nThose who can recite this scripture\nWill have their sins and evils naturally dissolve.\nRecite the scripture, practice filial piety and brotherly respect,\nReform conduct, repent past wrongs.\nBecome a divine immortal,\nNaturally ascending the celestial thoroughfare.\nThe celestial thoroughfare is difficult to ascend—\nPractice holds its secret method.\nThe secret method is not hard to seek—\nFilial piety naturally attains it.\n\nMeet with those of insight,\nAwaken to the scripture’s meaning.\nUnderstand and strive to practice—\nThen escape the paths of Fengdu.\nWithout abandoning past transgressions,\nOne may redeem the hun souls of ancestors.\nFollow the heart, practice filial piety and brotherly respect—\nNo need to recite this scripture.\nThis scripture repents foolishness,\nUsed to deliver those sunk in suffering.\n\nMay all my immortal disciples\nKeep filial piety and brotherly respect in their hearts.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Pure and Bright Orthodox Seal**\n\nThe myriad methods of the Pure and Bright\nBegin and end in forty chapters.\nTake filial piety as the origin,\nThe body as the foundation.\nOnly filial piety can be studied—\nThrough it, ascend to the celestial palace.\nThe celestial palace is originally in the eyes,\nYet my Dharma is not practiced.\nRecite this *Pure and Bright Scripture*,\nAnd practice the Pure and Bright Dharma.\nThe Dharma can dispel a thousand disasters,\nAnd cure the essence of ten thousand demonic spirits.\nWhen merit is complete, it naturally perfects,\nThrough a thousand kalpas, the body is not lost.\n\nIn the hall, an elder of a hundred years,\nWithin the household, no partiality.\nStill, there is a white-haired grandson,\nPlaying and laughing in the central courtyard.\nThis is the primordial qi,\nEntering the mysterious and profound.\nWithin the profound precepts,\nThirty-five divisions.\nFurther, there are wondrous teachings,\nTwo chapters of the *Numinous Scripture*.\n\nThey can extend life to a thousand or a hundred,\nSee ghosts and spirits,\nTransmute gold and jade,\nSummon wind and rain,\nSave the departed hun souls,\nDispel weapons and war.\nOnly by firmly upholding my teachings,\nReciting this scripture,\nWill divine immortals naturally appear.\nWith these three chapters,\nTeach you to chant and recite them—\nThen you may become a supreme perfected one.\n\nBecoming a true person is not difficult—\nStudy begins with filial piety.\nFilial piety and brotherly respect are not hard to practice—\nFollow the heart in serving parents.\nParents are originally celestial venerables—\nMay you awaken to this in your heart.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The Pure and Bright Numinous Treasure Talisman**\n\nRecite my *Scripture of Pure Brightness*,\nAnd further practice the Pure Brightness Dharma.\nFirst cultivate filial piety,\nThen refine the body’s form.\nOnce the body’s form is settled,\nTrue qi subdues the hundred ghosts.\nRescuing and protecting all sentient beings,\nOne may achieve meritorious deeds.\nAccumulating merit is not difficult—\nDiligently study the *Scripture of Pure Brightness*.\nThe Pure Brightness holds sacred talismans,\nWith incantations and signs most distinct.\nWithin resides the Numinous Treasure Venerable,\nThe Numinous Treasure Great Perfected One.\nThe Celestial Pivot’s Chief Recorder,\nThe Day-Watch Supreme Primordial Lord.\nThey oversee the secret teachings and practices,\nWhich, when performed, are naturally efficacious.\nThere are also great divine generals,\nThe Ten Celestial Great Demon Kings,\nThe Four Sage Great Generals,\nThe Sixteen Inner and Outer Generals,\nThe Four Watch Direct Talisman Officers.\nThey act on your behalf to activate the numinous talismans,\nThey act on your behalf to accomplish meritorious arts.\nOne who is unfilial and practices this Dharma\nIs like snow cast into boiling water—\nThe transgression dissolves of itself,\nAnd the unfilial transforms into sincere devotion.\nSincere devotion is foremost,\nAnd further, one may save the world’s people.\nMerit accumulates and is recorded in the heavens above,\nAnd the Dao of immortality naturally manifests.\nTo know one who practices filial piety,\nRecite again the *Scripture of Pure Brightness*.\nPracticing this Pure Brightness Dharma\nIs like a dragon’s feet generating clouds.\nOnce the dragon’s feet generate clouds,\nWind and thunder are all at your command—\nThe sacred talismans of Pure Brightness are efficacious.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Deliverance of the Six Relations**\n\nThe first talisman:\nIf one can receive and uphold it for parents and the six relations,\nOn the day of their fateful destiny,\nInscribe the talisman with cinnabar,\nHold the mudra and visualize oneself as the Filial Dao Radiant King.\nRecite the incantation and inscribe the talisman,\nHave the person ingest it—\nThen parents and the six relations will naturally enjoy longevity.\n\nThe second talisman:\nIf one can receive and uphold it for parents and the six relations,\nOn the day of their death,\nInscribe the talisman with cinnabar,\nHold the mudra and visualize oneself as the Filial Dao Radiant King.\nRecite the incantation and inscribe the talisman,\nBurn it and mix the ashes with clay,\nPlace it upon the deceased’s heart—\nThen, by the power of this Dharma,\nThe departed will return to life from death,\nTheir hun and po souls will be reborn,\nAnd they will naturally attain deliverance.\n\nIf one can practice these two talismans with utmost dedication,\nThe foundation of Dao-fruition is laid,\nAnd only then may one proceed to refine and ingest qi.\n\nMoreover, inscribe one talisman each day and burn it—\nThe living will be blessed with fortune,\nThe dead will attain immortality.\nThis is the eternal basis for liberation from life and death.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Refining the Body’s Form**\n\nThe first talisman bestowed\nEnables one to ascend to heaven in flight.\nThe second talisman\nOpens and illumines the celestial eye.\nWhen the celestial eye and celestial ear\nReach the Mud-Pill Palace,\nThis is the essential method for refining the body’s form—\nThe so-called transformation and birth in the various heavens.\n\nOne who holds the mudra, recites the incantation,\nAnd inscribes the two talismans daily with cinnabar to ingest them,\nWill have the true qi of the sun, moon, and five planets infuse their body.\nIngesting it, one will be free from hunger\nAnd naturally attain longevity.\n\nWhen inscribing, visualize oneself as the Filial Dao Radiant King\nAnd the Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Celestial Venerable—\nThen the Celestial Venerable will descend with true qi\nAnd abide within your body.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Healing the Hundred Diseases**\n\nThe first method revives the dead to life,\nThe second preserves life and roots vitality.\nFor all who suffer illness,\nClose the eyes and meditate in stillness,\nTake up cinnabar, hold the mudra, and recite the incantation,\nVisualize oneself as the Filial Dao Radiant King\nAnd the Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Savior from Suffering Celestial Venerable,\nForm the talisman into a pellet with the incantation water and ingest it—\nThen the afflicted will naturally recover.\n\nHealing illness is called the power of the Dao.\nPracticing the Dao with power is called gradual accumulation.\nPracticing the Dao with methods is called attaining the Dao.\nPracticing the Dao with filial piety is called the supreme Dao.\n\nThe Dao has three grades—upper, middle, and lower—\nThis is the lower grade.\nYet healing the hundred diseases\nAnd relieving the suffering of others\nCan also lead to immortality.\nAll who practice filial piety and ingest qi\nHave perfected their merit.\nThis is the auxiliary practice for cultivating filial piety and refining qi.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: Binding the Hundred Demons**\n\nThe talisman on the right binds the hundred demons.\nWhenever spirits of local altars or the Five Penetrations cause disturbances,\nBringing harm to the people—\nSuch as doors opening and closing of their own accord,\nOr ponds and reservoirs breaking—\nSwiftly take this talisman, recite the incantation, and hold the mudra,\nInscribe it with cinnabar and affix it for suppression—\nThen the disturbances will naturally dissipate.\n\nWhen inscribing the incantation and talisman,\nFace north and visualize oneself as the Filial Dao Radiant King\nAnd the Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Celestial Venerable,\nWith the Four Sages wielding the talisman in action.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Pacification and Summoning**\n\nFor summoning all things—\nWind and thunder, earth gods, and all spirits of heaven and earth—\nInscribe the talisman and burn it,\nAnd within seven days, they will arrive.\nIf one wishes to perform exorcism,\nInscribe the talisman on a large stone and bury it.\n\nThese are the secret talismans of the Supreme Filial Dao Radiant King\nAnd the Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Celestial Venerable.\nWhen inscribing talismans,\nVisualize oneself in their original form.\n\nThere are three scrolls of numinous scriptures,\nTo be transmitted only upon encountering a perfected person.\n\nHere ends the lower scroll of the *Supreme Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Wondrous Dao, Highest Grade*.",

The Supreme Primordial Azure**\nThe Supreme Ultimate is without peer; the Great Net begins in azure.\nWithin it dwells the Perfected, neither dying nor living.\nThe Most Honored in Heaven is called the Three Clarities.\nIn the Jade Clarity Palace resides the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning.\nIn the Highest Clarity Palace resides the Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure.\nIn the Grand Clarity Palace resides the Celestial Worthy of Dao and Virtue.\nThese are the Three Radiant Ones, each with their Perfected.\nThey have their stewards and ministers, left and right chancellors.\nJade lads and jade maidens, keepers of scriptures and scribes,\nScholars of the registers, who explicate texts and transcribe records.\nLaw officials and censors, with the central minister overseeing all.\nThe Lord who governs the cosmos is the Jade Emperor.\nHe receives the mandate of the Three Clarities and inspects the Purple Tenuity Court.\nThe attending officials receive the decrees of the Three Clarities.\nThe Purple Tenuity Court is the pivot of the hundred spirits.\nMinor matters are handled directly; major affairs are reported upward.\nThe Jade Emperor’s palace establishes the regulations.\nThe attending ministers correspond above to the Three Clarities.\nBeyond these, there are further ranks, each with its name.\nThe Northern and Southern Dippers are the Lords of Life and Death.\nTo the left is the Grand Tenuity, to the right the Lesser Tenuity Lord.\nThe Dark Capital governs judgments, the Celestial Pivot maintains the records.\nThe seventy-four bureaus are the officials of speech and tongue.\nThe general recorders and clerks investigate and discern the good.\nThis is called the Assembly Bureau, the Five Ministries of the Shangshu.\nThe Grand Tenuity, Lesser Tenuity, and Dark Capital governors—\nThese are the Three Departments, the Six Offices.\nThe altar adjudicators are likewise numbered.\nKnowing their names and ranks can lead to awakening.\nThose who cultivate our Dao may correspond to these ranks,\nAttending the Jade Emperor’s court with the Three-Five Flying Steps.\n\n**2.

      "translated_text": "Only those who understand loyalty and filial piety may study the Dao—this Way is easily known and not difficult to practice. To repent and awaken to the Dao is the highest goodness. To transform unfilial conduct into filial piety is to fulfill perfect filiality. Perfect filiality is not difficult: correct your errors as soon as they occur. If you once offended your parents, dare not offend them again. From this day forward, swear never to repeat such transgressions. Thus will the Celestial Emperor dispatch Perfected Ones to descend into the world, bestowing upon you the true oral instructions. Cultivate yourself and aid others, accumulating merit to become an immortal.\n\nThose who fail to awaken are like those who seek to cross a river without a raft—forever trapped in the wheel of rebirth, sinking into the realm of lesser ghosts.\n\n**Chapter Four: Entering the Dao and Cultivating the Self**\n\nThe Dao is utterly level, never inherently difficult. Yet delusion over right and wrong creates barriers, severing one from the great stream. Here lies the sequence for entering the Dao, the gateway to abandoning the mundane. There are cases where parents ascend together, husband and wife stand side by side. Anxious for their well-being, they practice filial piety, which is the essence of loyalty. This loyalty is rooted in the nature of the self, as steadfast as mountains. Yet ordinary people waver and falter, thus falling into peril. They treat the nurturing of qi lightly and neglect serving their parents. Their primordial qi dissipates, the great debt of gratitude fades away—how then can they serve their sovereign or fulfill the Emperor’s will? Thus their sins accumulate like the rivers, and the underworld officials will examine and punish them.\n\nAll you children of the Red Dust, heed my words. If I deceive you, may my eyes go blind, my ears deaf, my nose blocked, my mouth mute, my limbs paralyzed. May I never tread the Celestial Court or ascend upon the clouds. For billions of kalpas, may Fengdu subject me to its torments. But I pray that you, my children of the Red Dust, keep filial piety ever in your hearts. At home, serve your parents; in court, be loyal to your lord. Do not indulge in greed or lust, nor waste your essence. Then blessings from the gods will flow to you like a spring, naturally and ceaselessly.\n\nRecite this scripture day and night, and your soul and qi will naturally become numinous. If any among your kin suffer from illness or misfortune, it will naturally be resolved. If you dedicate this to wandering souls or stagnant spirits, they will escape the darkness of the underworld. With every recitation, the power of the Heavenly Worthy aids you. The Heavenly Worthy saves the people of the world, yet they remain ignorant of the principles of life. The Five Rebellions reside in their hearts, and when the Heavenly Worthy sees this, tears stream down like rain. It is not that the Heavenly Worthy abandons you—you must examine my sincerity.\n\n**Chapter Five: Cultivating the Self and Upholding the Teachings**\n\nThe Three Realms are scrutinized, as are the Five Peaks and the Three Officials. The Day-Patrolling Spirit Lords and the Ten Heavenly Demon Kings, along with the ledgers of sin and merit, the Central Pivot of Heaven’s Records—all are overseen. Seven assistants govern seventy-four subordinate bureaus, recording nothing too great or too small. At the Three Primes and Three Assemblies, reports are submitted to the Northern and Southern Offices. The Northern and Southern Offices determine the weight of deeds and report them to the Purple Tenuity. Lesser matters are sent to the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Twelve Palaces, and the Thirty-Two Heavens for separate judgment. Grave matters are personally conveyed to the Jade Emperor or adjudicated by the Three Clarities, their clarity like a mirror, their fairness like still water.\n\nThose who cultivate our Dao achieve completion through upholding the precepts. Serving one’s parents forms the marrow; refining the body forms the flesh and skin. Saving others is like a single hair; merit and virtue are one’s garments. If one is greedy for wealth, lustful, treacherous, or venomous—cast them down. If the heart craves meat, remember: another’s wealth is like the king’s grain—you must not hoard it. Another’s wife or daughter is like your own mother or daughter—you must not lust after them. Another’s goodness you must respect and never harm. Even the beasts and the six livestock—regard them as your children and endure not to eat their flesh.\n\nThus, if I wish to study immortality, the true youth must perfect the Ten Goodnesses and fulfill the Five Blessings. In life, become an immortal of the earth; in death, enter the Golden Chamber. No longer consume fire-cooked food or the Five Grains. Your soul will reside in the Vermilion Mound, undergoing refinement and preservation. You will tread the Jade Void, and the immortals will be your companions.\n\n**Chapter Six: Upholding the Teachings and Cultivating the Real**\n\nThe study of the Dao has its foundation; the ascent to immortality has its ladder. Only by knowing the secret instructions can one penetrate the mysteries. The body will then have nothing to be ashamed of, and the heart nothing to doubt. In non-action and solitude, meditate in the stillness of night. The spirit lords of the five viscera will one by one take flight, ascending to the Central Pivot and the Bureau of Essential Matters. With no transgressions to record, your merit will be evident.\n\nBy day, absorb the essence of the sun; by night, consume the fluid of the moon. Refine your hun and po, and you will naturally benefit. Your spirit will soar to the Three and Five, ascending to the Celestial Pole. Naturally, your name will reach the Heavenly Chief. The Lords of the North and South will present your name and your person before the Celestial Court. The Gates of Heaven will not dare to obstruct you; the hundred officials of the Central Pivot will welcome you. Thus, you will first receive immense blessings, and later accumulate primordial merit. You will inscribe talismans to summon rain, command clouds and winds with a shout. In life, you will be granted true office from afar; in death, you will rightfully enter the lineage of immortals. You will not fall into evil destinies nor be bound to the underworld bureaus. Your body will become a true lord of the upper heavens, overseeing the affairs of the lower realms. Above, you will illuminate your nine generations of ancestors, who will also ascend to the boundless. Below, you will shelter your nine generations of descendants, all endowed with immortal potential. They will know no cold or hunger, and blessings will naturally follow.\n\nDo not keep my words secret or prevent others from knowing them. Teach my children of the Red Dust to correct their errors and abandon their wrongs. Recite this scripture to ascend to the real. Whether you are a king or an emperor, it will dispel weapons and war. Whether for parents, siblings, or kin, it will plant the seeds of past affinities. Whether for the deceased, it will deliver their corporeal forms. All will attain their desires and follow the inclinations of their hearts. If your heart does not waver, you may study the Dao. You who study the Dao, reverently uphold my teachings.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Ascending to the Real and Recognizing the Spirit**\n\nThose who study the Dao and ascend to the real will ride clouds and fly upward. Heavenly scriptures will descend, and immortal palaces will welcome them. Who are these immortal officials? They are the various Perfected Ones. Twin dragons pull their chariots; mighty warriors bear their standards. Before them, heralds clear the way; behind them, celestial soldiers guard. Jade lads and jade maidens hold the seals and sashes. Silver-eared attendants transmit the Emperor’s commands. In this, there is no fear, no alarm. Naturally, your hun and po will undergo refinement in the Vermilion Mound.",

The Eastern Florescence Gate is governed by its overseers. Within presides the Sovereign of the Day’s Duty, the Primordial Lord. Within presides the Adjudicator, the Venerable Recording Deity. Within presides the Gatekeeper, the Vajra Warrior. Three Perfected Immortals inquire of your name, examine your transgressions, and rank your merits. Without error or fault, you may then enter. Two Recording Clerks escort you upward.\n\nThe Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper each have their True Lords. Once the Recording Clerks withdraw, the True Lords welcome you. In due order, they memorialize your ascent to the Purple Tenuity Court. At this moment, the Dao of immortality is achieved. Bowing to the Great Veil, the Primordial Jade Clarity, the Jade Emperor of the Luminous Heavens, and the Three Radiance Heavenly Worthies—these cannot be seen, only glimpsed in auspicious clouds. Jade lads transmit the decree, faintly audible. They bestow upon you cinnabar elixirs, golden pendants, and pearl tassels. Upon receiving them, you prostrate and dance in joy. True immortals will then instruct you in the rites of audience.\n\nThis scripture is truly wondrous, and thus its account is brief. Hold it in mind with care, lest you err or stray. Recite the true scripture ceaselessly, and divine officials will grant you elixirs, elevating you to heavenly rank.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Shallow Practice and Corpse Liberation**\n\nThose who practice the Dao shallowly may ascend as immortals through corpse liberation. Before death, they must possess good karmic conditions. When their kalpas of worldly dust are exhausted, their names are stricken from the registers of Mount Tai in the east and Mount Hua in the west. The Earth God’s divine lord dispatches two envoys to summon and guide their hun and po souls. At this time, you must firmly recall your karmic causes and, upon meeting the underworld officials, stand before the courts of the nether gates. Within lie tribunals and prisons, dreadful and alarming. Yet you must not fear; state your case directly, recount your karmic origins, and conceal nothing of your sincerity.\n\nIf your name is absent from the ledger of transgressions but present in the ledger of virtues, the True Lord of the Eastern Ultimate Who Saves from Suffering will question you with kind words, welcome you joyfully, and invite you to ascend in a jade carriage with four wheels. The attending deities on either side are as those in the ascent to reality. You must recognize their names and titles, for they escort your spirit to undergo refinement in the Vermilion Mound. Ascending through the ranks in due order, you wander freely upward, entering the gates of Heaven and the Purple Tenuity Court. Some receive elixirs, others true scriptures; jade lads transmit the edicts, just as in the flight to ascension.\n\nYour bones and flesh remain behind, a discarded form—like the molted husk of a snake or cicada, foul yet fragrant. Your children and grandchildren, burying you with utmost sincerity, may struggle to relinquish their love, for worldly attachments linger. At times, you may return for a visit, and your descendants will weep, unable to see your form. If at this moment you cannot yet sever your emotions, fix your thoughts on the dusty realm, neither entering the netherworld nor accepting the dust of mortality. Sever affection, abandon love, and establish the foundation of your Dao. Your children and grandchildren may yet benefit from this. Ascending beyond ignorance and bondage also serves as a ladder to immortality. The ladder to immortality lies before your eyes, yet people remain unaware.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Ranked Ascent and Registry Enrollment**\n\nThose who ascend through corpse liberation share the same Dao but tread different paths, all called transcendence, their names inscribed in the true registers. Some receive transmission in life and posthumous elevation; others are elevated only after death. There are those who receive transmission but are not elevated, but none are elevated without prior transmission. Some serve in the Celestial Pivot’s administrative offices, others in its furnishings and arrays. Each has their rank, emerging from the Supreme Beginning Azure. Some are recorded, some named.\n\nThe upper rank is defined by filial piety, the middle by bodily refinement, and the lower by salvation—all transcend worldly dust. The primordial net unfolds naturally, arranging ranks. Enrollment in the registry is simple, not cumbersome. The Left and Right Bureaus oversee the Most Wondrous Forbidden Altar. Within lies the Near Forbidden, the Purple Tenuity Azure Altar. Within lies the essential ground, the Golden Portal Crimson Altar. The Three Clarities’ attending ministers serve as left and right aides. The Thirty-Two Heavens also have their chief ministers.\n\nWithin the mundane realm, there are civil and martial officials, civil and martial meritorious deeds. Grand envoys, minor envoys, envoys of various titles. True Persons command armies, six offices with twelve divisions. The Supreme Emperor bestows grace, each receiving secret talismanic words. The fewer the words, the greater their value; their language is unadorned. They strike directly at your heart, leaving no flaw.\n\nCloud chariots and cloud horses belong to the Three Clarities’ domain. Like jade refined by carving, like gold freed from ore—those who can be molded into vessels do not fail. Those who are cast aside, rejected. All named upper immortals occupy ranks among the immortals. Civil and martial registers naturally distinguish them. The Most High’s methods are simple, requiring neither paper nor ink. Recite the true scripture ceaselessly, and your heart will not waver. Once your hun and po souls are adept, attainment comes naturally.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Ranked Enrollment and Graded Ascent**\n\nPeople advance in sequence: the upper study to penetrate reality, the middle accumulate conduct, and the lower strive to achieve merit. Some serve as pure officials in the Nine Palaces, others as minor clerks. Appointments are made according to ability, names recorded among the various armies. The Three Heavens’ River Source and the Six Treasuries’ officials and soldiers—regardless of strength or weakness, men or women—ceaselessly follow karmic conditions to attain this supreme cause.\n\nJade lads radiate brilliance; upper-ranked women are among them. Those of lower rank may serve as female soldiers. Some possess innate skills, others innate numinosity. Good causes arise from study, and study is perfected through precepts. Initially, observe precepts with caution, avoiding forced labor. Cultivate these arts and accumulate virtues. What is learned in life becomes strength after death. Cloud paths arrange ranks, and the netherworld confers offices. Each develops their strengths, naturally free from confusion.\n\nThose of higher virtue may lack ability yet possess it, lack knowledge yet know, lack awareness yet understand—this is the power of the ten virtues. Thus, some remain empty, nurturing themselves in tranquility, their names listed among the unassigned officials. The Supreme Emperor’s talismans descend, entrusting them with tasks for careful consideration. Some join the ranks of the forbidden and near, others serve as supernumerary officials. Some become jade lads, attending the Morning Ultimate’s imperial chambers. Others serve as attendants, hurrying through palace corridors. Some become warriors, their armor and shields radiating light. Upper generals hold rank, commanding troops on the march. Some serve as generals in charge, others as common soldiers in the ranks.",
      "overlap_context": "tures will descend, and immortal palaces will welcome them. Who are these immortal officials? They are the various Perfected Ones. Twin dragons pull their chariots; mighty warriors bear their standards. Before them, heralds clear the way; behind them, celestial soldiers guard. Jade lads and jade maidens hold the seals and sashes. Silver-eared attendants transmit the Emperor’s commands. In this, there is no fear, no alarm. Naturally, your hun and po will undergo refinement in the Vermilion Mound.",

welcome.\nAt this time, Heaven bestows numinous elixir:\nTo the left, seven bonds form the Lord of the Sun;\nTo the right, seven slayers form the Lord of the Moon.\nSwallowing and breathing—\nThis is the true elixir.\nThere is the odd, there is the even,\nThere is the yang, there is the yin.\nThe elixir of yin and yang,\nWhen ingested, grants long life.\nSome attain extended lifespan,\nSome achieve liberation through *shi*-transformation and become Perfected.\nSome gain penetrating vision,\nAble to scrutinize the hundred spirits.\nThe secret of Heaven’s Center,\nThe scripture of Heaven’s Center,\nThe office of Heaven’s Center,\nThe duty of Heaven’s Center—\nEach is attained within the body,\nNot necessarily through a master’s transmission,\nBut arising from Heaven’s completion.\nWhat

Kings,\nThe Great Gods of Long Life,\nThe True Emperors of the Five Directions,\nGuard and protect one’s form.\nLike the sun and moon,\nThe longer they endure, the brighter they grow.\nLike the Five

Mysteries*.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Cultivating Merit to Achieve Reality**\n\nWho does not desire to attain immortality?\nStudy immortality in youth.\nIn youth, serve with loyalty and filial piety,\nAccumulating long practice to form a root of goodness.\nMoreover, perfect the *qi* and blood,\nAscending and descending within the cinnabar field.\nHold talismans to cure others’ illnesses,\nAnd hidden virtue may transcend the ordinary.\nCultivate practice using my method—\nWhat worry is there of not ascending to Heaven?\nI possess the *Scripture of Purity and

them to aid you.\nIf you are good at upholding the Dao,\nEven the various demons and devils\nWill wish to pay homage to you.\nThis is due to the quality of loyalty and filial piety,\nAnd the preservation of true *qi*.\nHaving merit among the multitude,\nOne ranks among the immortals’ assembly.\nThose who cannot practice this Dao\nWill find it difficult to obtain the method.\nEven if one obtains my method,\nThis art will not be efficacious.\nIf loyalty and filial piety are not in the heart,\n*Qi* and blood are lost for the sake of profit.\nThe Dao of immortality grows ever more

to kill—\nThis is called *love of killing*.\nThose who resent their parents\nCannot obtain life;\nThough they live, they may be killed.\nThus, the truly filial do not die,\nThe utmost filial attain immortality.\nThe Dao of immortality is easy,\nThe way of ghosts is difficult.\nGoodness is the constant of good people,\nEvil is the pretense of evil people.\nGoodness, through habitual practice, may become evil;\nEvil, if not evil and reformed, becomes goodness.\nThus, those who reveal arrogance receive reward,\nThose who secretly accumulate meet execution.\nUsing pretense to encourage goodness

one may know.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: Penetrating Knowledge of Past Lives**\n\nIllumine the true without obscurity,\nPenetrate knowledge of past lives.\nAttain former habits,\nTo cultivate good roots.\nWithout error or fault,\nStudy the divine immortals.\n\nWhat is the Dao of immortals?\nWhere the numinous nature reaches.\nOnly through penetrating knowledge\nCan one attain the mysterious precepts.\nThe mysterious precepts are most clear—\nBehold my former studies.\nWith those former studies,\nOne may repeatedly transgress,\nOne may repeatedly achieve,\nAnd naturally become true.\nBecoming true is not difficult,\nAttained only through learning.\nThrough eternal kalpas unchanged,\nTrue knowledge unconfused—\nThis is penetrating knowledge.\n\nFrom that penetrating knowledge,\nOne reaches penetrating spirit.\nFrom that penetrating spirit,\nOne can achieve penetrating vision.\nWhat is called *penetrating*?\nDark and light all discerned,\nBright and obscure unshaken—\nThis is supreme wisdom.\n\nThe spirit soars in threes and fives,\nRoaming and feasting among the heavens.\nAbove the heavens,\nEach has its true person.\nThe arts of the true person\nAre most clear in meaning.\nPurify the viscera,\nNurture the essence-spirit.\n\nThe medicine of nature,\nTalismans and incantations most efficacious.\nThere is the celestial drum—\nStruck, it resounds mightily.\nThere is the jade spring—\nDrawn, it overflows.\nThe coming of the jade spring,\nThe nectar of the flower pool,\nIts essence like honey,\nIts flavor most true.\n\nSwallow and rinse, sound the drum,\nSix by six, complete the cycle.\nTo preserve my spirit,\nBathe in the moon, wash in the sun.\nSun and moon now bright,\nHeaven and earth illuminated.\nThe myriad forms unfold,\nThe spirit-soul transcends.\n\nThis is the clarity of penetrating vision,\nBy which to examine ghosts and spirits.\nIt can illuminate ten thousand miles,\nIt can illumine one’s own body.\nGuarded by ghosts and spirits,\nIt reaches the subtle and obscure.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Reviving the Dead and Restoring Life**\n\nSpittle eases cultivation,\nStroking qi to unite with spirit.\nThe Five Celestial Great Demons,\nAncestors of the ten thousand spirits.\nSummon them to return—\nWithin, there is a true person.\nPreserve life, secure its root,\nGather and guide the hun and po souls.\nReturn them to their dwelling,\nUnshaken, unagitated.\nControl them so they do not scatter—\nWithered trees bloom anew.\n\nChaos and obscurity merge,\nConverging in the mud-pill palace.\nWithin the mud-pill palace,\nIt connects to the crimson palace.\nThe spirit of the crimson palace,\nReturning, reverts to the true.\nThus, dry bones\nMay live again,\nAll rising to become human.\n\nAt this time, there are:\nThe Demon Mud,\nThe Dharma Ancestor,\nThe Return to True,\nThe Bewildered,\nThe Profound Net—\nEnvoys of the Five Celestial Heavens,\nKnown as Zhao, Meng, and Wu.\nThey command the flying hun and soaring po ghosts,\nSummoned by secret formulas,\nDirected by methods.\nAs the sovereign of the body,\nThey are the Dharma Kings of liberating the dead.\n\nThere is also the upright qi,\nSpread within and without.\nWithin and without now harmonized,\nIt reaches the joints.\nUnshaken, unagitated,\nSuddenly, one attains it.\n\nThen recite the incantation:\n*True Person of Reviving Life,\nTrue Person of Saving from Suffering.\nSpittle eases cultivation,\nUnite qi to merge with spirit.\nHun and po souls return again,\nThe register of death removes the name.\nThe Five Celestial Great Demons,\nLiberate the corpse’s form.\nLet so-and-so live again,\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.*\n\nAs for the secret formulas for the eyes and joints preserved in the esoteric texts—\nIf one encounters a person of karmic affinity,\nThey may receive and uphold them.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Underworld’s Examination of Forms**\n\nOn Mount Fengdu,\nThere are prisons and cells.\nA Great Emperor Lord\nPresides over its judgments.\nTens of thousands of demonic nets,\nExamine and punish evil ghosts.\nHundreds of thousands of deaths,\nDying and being reborn.\nThrough kalpas of cyclic rebirth,\nThey become the six livestock.\n\nAsking the reason—\nAll due to lack of filial piety.\nThe five rebellions of unfilial conduct\nStem from the root of the heart.\nA foolish heart unrepentant\nSoon becomes disobedience.\nDisobedience and unfiliality\nTransform into disloyalty.\nGreed for wealth, greed for beauty,\nGreed for wine, greed for lust.\nFrom these causes and conditions,\nMany misfortunes arise.\nOffending yin and yang,\nProvoking heaven and earth.\nThe twelve double-hours\nRecord their transgressions.\nReported to the celestial court,\nThe celestial court issues its decree.\nDelivered to the celestial pivot,\nTheir hun souls are bound,\nAfter death, entering Fengdu.\n\nThose who can recite this scripture\nWill have their sins and evils naturally dissolve.\nRecite the scripture, practice filial piety and brotherly respect,\nReform conduct, repent past wrongs.\nBecome a divine immortal,\nNaturally ascending the celestial thoroughfare.\nThe celestial thoroughfare is difficult to ascend—\nPractice holds its secret method.\nThe secret method is not hard to seek—\nFilial piety naturally attains it.\n\nMeet with those of insight,\nAwaken to the scripture’s meaning.\nUnderstand and strive to practice—\nThen escape the paths of Fengdu.\nWithout abandoning past transgressions,\nOne may redeem the hun souls of ancestors.\nFollow the heart, practice filial piety and brotherly respect—\nNo need to recite this scripture.\nThis scripture repents foolishness,\nUsed to deliver those sunk in suffering.\n\nMay all my immortal disciples\nKeep filial piety and brotherly respect in their hearts.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Pure and Bright Orthodox Seal**\n\nThe myriad methods of the Pure and Bright\nBegin and end in forty chapters.\nTake filial piety as the origin,\nThe body as the foundation.\nOnly filial piety can be studied—\nThrough it, ascend to the celestial palace.\nThe celestial palace is originally in the eyes,\nYet my Dharma is not practiced.\nRecite this *Pure and Bright Scripture*,\nAnd practice the Pure and Bright Dharma.\nThe Dharma can dispel a thousand disasters,\nAnd cure the essence of ten thousand demonic spirits.\nWhen merit is complete, it naturally perfects,\nThrough a thousand kalpas, the body is not lost.\n\nIn the hall, an elder of a hundred years,\nWithin the household, no partiality.\nStill, there is a white-haired grandson,\nPlaying and laughing in the central courtyard.\nThis is the primordial qi,\nEntering the mysterious and profound.\nWithin the profound precepts,\nThirty-five divisions.\nFurther, there are wondrous teachings,\nTwo chapters of the *Numinous Scripture*.\n\nThey can extend life to a thousand or a hundred,\nSee ghosts and spirits,\nTransmute gold and jade,\nSummon wind and rain,\nSave the departed hun souls,\nDispel weapons and war.\nOnly by firmly upholding my teachings,\nReciting this scripture,\nWill divine immortals naturally appear.\nWith these three chapters,\nTeach you to chant and recite them—\nThen you may become a supreme perfected one.\n\nBecoming a true person is not difficult—\nStudy begins with filial piety.\nFilial piety and brotherly respect are not hard to practice—\nFollow the heart in serving parents.\nParents are originally celestial venerables—\nMay you awaken to this in your heart.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The Pure and Bright Numinous Treasure Talisman**",

Officers.\nThey act on your behalf to activate the numinous talismans,\nThey act on your behalf to accomplish meritorious arts.\nOne who is unfilial and practices this Dharma\nIs like snow cast into boiling water—\nThe transgression dissolves of itself,\nAnd the unfilial transforms into sincere devotion.\nSincere devotion is foremost,\nAnd further, one may save the world’s people.\nMerit accumulates and is recorded in the heavens above,\nAnd the Dao of immortality naturally manifests.\nTo know one who practices filial piety,\nRecite again the *Scripture of Pure Brightness*.\nPracticing this Pure Brightness Dharma\nIs like a dragon’s feet generating clouds.\nOnce the dragon’s feet generate clouds,\nWind and thunder are all at your command—\nThe sacred talismans of Pure Brightness are efficacious.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Deliverance of the Six Relations**\n\nThe first talisman:\nIf one can receive and uphold it for parents and the six
