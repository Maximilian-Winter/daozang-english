  "full_translation": "**\"The Secret Transmission of the Supreme Elixir by Master Qiu: Direct Pointers**\n\n**I. On the Three Treasures and Three Essentials**\nCultivation has three treasures and three essentials. The three treasures are *jing*, *qi*, and *shen*.\n*Jing* is the primordial *yuan-yang* of the prenatal essence;\n*Qi* is the ancestral *qi* of the body before birth;\n*Shen* is nature, bestowed by Heaven.\nThese three refined substances are the supreme medicines:\nRefine *jing* to transform into *qi*,\nRefine *qi* to transform into *shen*,\nRefine *shen* to attain the Dao.\nThe three essentials are:\nFirst, the *dinglu* (cauldron-furnace), though named variably, is in truth the single *xuan-guan* (mysterious pass);\nSecond, the *yao-wu* (medicinal substance), though named variably, is in truth the prenatal *qi*;\nThird, the *huo-hou* (fire timing), though named variably, is in truth the wondrous application of the original *shen*.\n\n**II. On the Three Passes and Three Fields**\nThe three passes—*wei-lu* (tail pass), *jia-ji* (intervertebral), and *yu-zhen* (jade pillow)—lie along the *du mai* (governing vessel), belonging to *yang*.\nThe three fields—upper *dan-tian* (elixir field), middle *dan-tian*, and lower *dan-tian*—lie along the *ren mai* (conception vessel), belonging to *yin*.\nThese are the paths of *yin-yang* ascent and descent:\nFrom the *du mai* behind, ascending from the child (*zi*), and from the *ren mai* before, descending to the noon (*wu*), forming the *zi-wu* (child-noon) circulation—the so-called *zhou-tian* (microcosmic orbit) fire timing.\n\nNow on the three passes:\nThe *wei-lu* pass is at the base of the spine, where the vertebrae end, its passage connecting to the inner kidney orifice.\nStraight above, at the inner kidney’s corresponding point on the spine, is the *jia-ji* double pass.\nFurther upward to the back of the head is the *yu-zhen* pass.\nThese three passes open a single marrow path, called *cao-xi* (canal creek) or *huang-he* (Yellow River), the route by which *yang qi* ascends.\n\nNext, the three fields:\nThe *ni-wan* (mud pellet) is the upper *dan-tian*, its orifice three *cun* inward from the midpoint between the brows, circular with a diameter of one *cun* and two *fen*, a hollow point where *shen* resides.\nThree *cun* and six *fen* below the heart is the *tu-fu* (earth furnace), the Yellow Court Palace—this is the middle *dan-tian*, circular with a diameter of one *cun* and two *fen*, also a hollow point where *qi* resides, the cauldron for elixir refinement.\nDirectly below, opposite the navel, approximately three *cun* and six *fen* distant—hence the saying, *\"Thirty-six above heaven, thirty-six below earth.\"* From heaven to earth, eighty-four thousand *li*; from heart to kidney, eight *cun* and four *fen*—three *cun* and six *fen* for the heavenly heart, three *cun* and six *fen* for the earthly kidney, and one *cun* and two *fen* for the middle *dan-tian*—what else could it be?\nBehind the navel, before the kidneys, lies the *yan-yue-lu* (reclining crescent furnace), also called *qi-hai* (sea of *qi*).\nOne *cun* and three *fen* lower is the *hua-chi* (flower pool), also the lower *dan-tian*, circular with a diameter of one *cun* and two *fen*, another hollow point where *jing* resides and medicinal substances are gathered.\nHere are two orifices: one above leading to the inner kidney, one below leading to the *wei-lu* pass. Between them lies the *xuan-guan* (mysterious pass), a void within substance, where the single *yi-qi* (original *qi*) emerges—when the *xuan-guan* opens, the pass is born.\n\n**III. On the Eight Extraordinary Vessels**\nThe eight vessels are:\nThe *chong mai* (penetrating vessel) below the *feng-fu* (wind palace) orifice,\nThe *du mai* (governing vessel) behind the navel,\nThe *ren mai* (conception vessel) before the navel,\nThe *dai mai* (girdle vessel) at the waist,\nThe *yin-jiao mai* (yin linking vessel) before the *wei-lu* pass, below the scrotum,\nThe *yang-jiao mai* (yang linking vessel) two nodes behind the *wei-lu* pass,\nThe *yin-wei mai* (yin maintaining vessel) one *cun* and three *fen* before the crown,\nThe *yang-wei mai* (yang maintaining vessel) one *cun* and three *fen* behind the crown.\nAll eight vessels belong to the *yin shen* (dark spirit) in mortals, sealed and unopened—only immortals, through *yang qi*, can burst them open, thus attaining the Dao.\nThese eight vessels are the roots of the primordial Dao, the origin of the single *qi*.\nTo gather them, begin with the *yin-jiao mai*—when this vessel moves, all vessels open.\nNext are the *du mai*, *ren mai*, and *chong mai*, the sources of the twelve primary channels’ transformations.\nThe *yin-jiao mai* alone connects above to the *ni-wan* and below to the *yong-quan* (gushing spring).\nIf one understands this, directing the true *qi* to gather and disperse through this pass, the heavenly gate remains open, the earthly gate forever sealed, and the *di mai* (tail vessel) circulates through the body, piercing above and below. Harmonious *qi* ascends naturally, *yang* grows while *yin* wanes—*\"The celestial root and lunar cavern move freely; thirty-six palaces bloom with spring.\"* Those who attain this are light and agile, their youth restored, their minds dazed as if drunk or mad—this is the proof.\n\n**IV. On the Water-Fire of *Kan* and *Li***\nBefore birth, a single point of congealing essence is pure chaos, the nature of life.\nAt three months, the *xuan-pin* (mysterious female) forms, the navel like a gourd’s stem, the child in the womb breathing with the mother.\nAfter birth, the navel cord is severed—heaven and earth invert, and the single true *yang* condenses at the navel.\n*Kan* (water) transforms into *Li* (fire), *Kun* (earth) transforms into *Kan*—thus the *shen* departs, the *qi* shifts, no longer guarding the prenatal breath.\nThe breath unguarded means the heart fire belongs to *Li*, like mercury seeking flight, while thoughts of emptiness and meditation further sever its connection with kidney water.\nKidney water belongs to *Kan*, like lead seeking descent, while emotional agitation weakens its hold, further severing its connection with heart fire.\nKidney remains kidney, heart remains heart—water and fire separate, their ascent and descent unrestrained, *Kan* and *Li* unable to invert.\nNot only does the elixir fail to form, but disease arises—how could there be true life?\n\nFurther on *tai-xi* (embryonic breathing):\nIf inhalation is not governed by *shen*, the breath is incomplete;\nIf exhalation is not governed by *shen*, the breath is also incomplete.\nIf each breath returns to its root, interfacing with the prenatal original *qi*, *shen* enters *qi*, *qi* envelops *shen*—like the child in the womb breathing—this is *tai-xi*.\nFor breathing is *qi*, *shen* is the heart—governing *qi* with *shen*, preserving form with *qi*, and governing *qi* with *shen* to attain the Dao—this is to refine the medicinal substance with fire to form the elixir.\"\n\nFive, on Breathing, the Essential Method says:\n*Qi* is the medicine that extends life, the heart is the sovereign that commands *qi*;\nIf one knows the origin of *shen* and *qi*, then one has attained the Dao of the Immortals.\nFor breathing is where *qi* arises—\nthe exhalation is the *qi* of parents, the inhalation is the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\nWhen *qi* aligns with form and *shen* with *qi*, then life is in our grasp.\nOrdinary people do not know where to store and govern their breathing—\nforcibly closing its entry and exit is no different from the stillness of death.\nOr they let it flow freely, and then the original *qi* departs with the exhalation,\nonly to be seized by Heaven and Earth.\nThus arises the teaching of \"drawing and adding\" *qi*,\nto bring the breath to its root and foundation.\nInhalation comes from outside to within,\nexhalation also returns inward—\ninhalation gathers at the childlike *yu-dong* (玉洞) of the womb,\nexhalation ascends straight to the peak of *Kunlun* (昆仑).\nBreathing then circulates as a single *qi*, forming the embryonic breath (*tai-xi*).\nBut how does one breath become this?\n\nWith prolonged breathing,\none may notice an inhalation reaching within,\nyet over time, one does not feel breathlessness—\njust as the child breathes in the mother’s womb,\nso it is embryonic breath (*tai-xi*).\nYet ordinary people only know inhalation is within,\nunaware that exhalation is also within.\nKnowing this, one can reclaim the *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nand only then may it be called the \"medicine that extends life.\"\n\nSix, on the Mysterious Aperture, it is further said:\nYou wish to practice internal breathing?\nYou must grasp its singular essence,\nand then all matters are complete.\nThis singular essence is one aperture,\nthough it contains two orifices—\ntwo orifices yet are but one aperture.\nThis aperture has no inside or outside,\nno boundary—\nwithin it, the *Dao* of *Kan* and *Li* (乾坤) harmonizes the Five *Qi* (五氣),\nand unites the Hundred *Shen* (百神).\nHere lies the root and foundation,\nthe place where the embryonic breath is sealed—\nlife and essence begin here,\nand *jing-qi-shen* (精氣神) all arise from this.\nAt the moment of my birth, when the *qi* of my parents first mingled,\na single thread flowed through this aperture,\nas if a pipe without holes—\na flute blown by a faceless one.\nWith this pipe, the kidneys form,\nand all the viscera and bowels,\nthe meridians of the body,\nall arise from here—\nalso called the *Total Support Gate* (總持門),\nthe *Three Pass Key Route* (三關要路).\nIn the mother’s womb,\ninhalation gathers here, uniting with Heaven’s descent,\nexhalation arises from here, uniting with Earth’s ascent—\nalso named the *Tortoise’s Nasal Tip* (龜鼻頭).\nOnly this aperture is the root of internal breathing,\nwhere the original prenatal *qi* truly dwells,\nand where the *qi* of Heaven and Earth truly enters.\nPeople mistakenly take the *Command Gate* (命門) as the Mysterious,\nand the *Kidney Chamber* (腎堂) as the Feminine—\nthis is a thousand leagues from the truth.\nThe Mysterious and the Feminine are the roots of Heaven and Earth,\nlocated in the southwest *Kun* (坤) land,\nbehind the navel, before the kidneys—\nyet it is neither the aperture a *cun* below the navel,\nnor the hollow between the two kidneys.\nThis is the true aperture,\nable to be obtained and known.\nIt connects above with the *Níhuán* (泥丸),\npenetrates below to the *Yǒngquán* (涌泉),\nand in the middle interfaces with the heart and kidneys—\nhollow and straight within,\nunfindable by form or graspable by thought.\nThe true prenatal seed is stored here,\nconnecting Heaven and Earth,\nconnecting the divine and the sacred—\nto obtain it is life,\nto lose it is death.\nThis is where the Heavenly Immortals begin their practice;\nto abandon this is to descend into the *Yùdōu* (酆都) and the Nine Abysses (*Jiǔyōu* 九幽).\n\nSeven, on Sealing the *Duì* (兑) and Lowering the Curtain:\nSealing the *Duì* (兑) is to close the mouth and prevent *shen* and *qi* from scattering,\nthus it is sealed.\nLowering the curtain is to keep the eyes half-closed—\nfully open and *shen* leaks out,\nfully closed and *shen* grows dim;\nonly half-closed preserves clarity.\nBetween the two eyes lies the Heavenly Root,\nthe so-called \"life-and-essence gate.\"\nIts root is in the eyes,\neyes belong to the heart,\nthe heart generates transformation—\nthis belongs to the deepest Mysterious,\nthe Immortals call it the \"Gate of the Mysterious Feminine.\"\nWithin, the heart and kidneys are the inner sun and moon,\ninterfacing internally;\nwithout, the two eyes are the outer sun and moon,\ninterfacing externally—\nwhen water and fire gather without dispersing,\n*qi* naturally harmonizes.\n\nEight, on Returning the Light and Regulating the Breath:\nTo clarify the method of returning the light and regulating the breath,\none must know the wondrous function of the *Guān-Yīn Dāng* (觀音堂).\nWhat is the *Guān-Yīn Dāng* (觀音堂)?\n*Guān* belongs to the eyes,\n*yīn* belongs to the ears,\neyes belong to the heart,\nears belong to the kidneys—\nthe place where the heart and kidneys interface\nis the *Guān-Yīn Dāng* (觀音堂),\nwhich governs the *shen* and *qi* of the body.\nIts method is to gather the heart from the two corners of the eyes,\nto the space between them,\nand with the body’s *shen* and *qi*,\nto fully gather here—\nthis is the saying, \"Gather the entire *Kan* and *Li* (乾坤) of the great earth.\"\nWhen the heart is settled,\nfrom here, gaze downward at the tip of the nose,\nstraight down to the navel below.\nLet the eyes remain here,\nstill and unmoving,\nas the nose breathes—\nregulating the breath gently,\nas if present or as if absent.\nWithout effort,\nthe true breath will naturally regulate itself—\n\"the breath does not depend on the nose’s exterior,\nthought ceases within the body.\"\nThis is precisely the meaning.\nIt is further said:\n\"The toad’s light shines all day upon the western river—\nthis is the root of the medicine.\"\nThe toad’s light is the eye’s light,\nthe western river is the *Kun* (坤) land below the navel.\nThus, returning the light to the navel below,\nto regulate the true breath,\nis for the *shen* to enter the *qi* aperture.\nWith prolonged returning of the light,\na single point of true *yang* (陽) forms in the kidneys,\nascending to merge with the heart’s *shen*—\nthen the heart’s breath and the *qi*’s breath depend on each other (for internal breath is *qi*).\nWhen the heart’s breath and the *qi*’s breath depend on each other,\nwater and fire are both fulfilled.\nThe practice of returning the light and regulating the breath\nmust be done when stillness is encountered,\nwithout regard for *zi-wǔ* (子午),\nand may be performed in all twelve hours.\nWhen practicing,\nif the mind wanders, gather it back—\nthis is the saying, \"Release and return are all in its grasp.\"\nWith prolonged practice,\none’s heart naturally awakens—\nthe Five Bandits depart first.\nThe Five Bandits are the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and mind.\nWhen the eyes do not gaze outward but inwardly illuminate,\nthe soul abides in the liver and does not leak from the eyes;\nWhen the ears do not hear sounds but listen in return,\nthe essence abides in the kidneys and does not leak from the ears;\nWhen the nose does not sniff scents but regulates the breath,\nthe *pò* (魄) abides in the lungs and does not leak from the nose;\nWhen the mouth does not speak and seals the *Duì* (兑),\nthe thought abides in the spleen and does not leak from the mouth;\n\n「意不妄想而默守，则神在心而不从意漏；\nWhen the mind does not stray in idle thought but remains silently vigilant,\nthe spirit abides in the heart and does not leak from the mind.\n\n如此精神魂魄意，攒簇在坤位，则独修无漏矣；\nThus, the spirit, soul, *pò* (魄), and mind,\nclustered within the *Kūn* (坤) position,\nare rendered impermeable in solitary cultivation.\n\n九、论采药\n**Chapter Nine: On Extracting the Elixir**\nThe elixir—what is it? It is the original *qi* of my body.\nOriginal *qi* flows through the channels of *qìxiě* (氣血),\nand thus the ears can hear, the eyes can see,\nthe hands can grasp, and the feet can walk.\nYet, though humans live,\nit is the original *qi* that sustains them—\nthus, it is forcefully named “**Mìng** (命),” while the heart contains the spirit,\nforcefully named “**Xìng** (性).”\nThe interplay of spirit and *qi*,\nthe union of nature and life,\nis why it is called “**double cultivation**.”\nThe effort lies solely in the “double” character.\nWhen the heart’s fire ascends and the kidney’s water leaks downward,\nthey no longer unite—\nthus, cultivating nature must also cultivate life.\n\nThe Dao of double cultivation has no other secret:\nIt is merely taking the *qi* from the kidneys\nto unite with the spirit within the heart.\n\n**The Method for Extracting *Qi*:**\nThe spine has twenty-one vertebrae;\ncounting from below upward,\nthe seventh vertebra is where the two kidneys reside.\nWhen *Tian Yi* (天一) generates water,\nafter the *Zǐ* (子) hour at night,\none *Yáng* (陽) begins to arise,\nand the body’s original *qi*,\nfrom the *Wěi Liú* (尾闾) acupoint,\nascends from below to the kidneys.\nBetween the two kidneys lies an orifice,\nright at the center of the seventh vertebra,\nfrom which the original *qi* issues forth,\nsurging and striking the *Yáng Guān* (陽關).\nThus, when a person sleeps past midnight in the *Zǐ* hour,\nthe external kidneys raise *Yáng*.\nIf *Yáng* does not raise itself,\nit is the *qi* from the internal kidney orifice that surges outward,\nraising the external kidneys.\n\nAt the moment when the internal kidney’s *Yáng qi* is about to reach the external kidneys,\none may undress and sit upright,\nlowering the gaze and sealing the lips,\nregulating the breath softly and continuously,\nwhile visualizing between the two kidneys—\nas if *qi* emerges from there,\nthis *qi* is called **lead (铅)**,\nthe gold within water,\nalso named **White Tiger (白虎)**.\nNightly, one practices this technique,\nand only then retires to sleep.\n\nThe kidney’s channels connect with the heart;\nwhen the lower *qi* stirs, the upper responds—\nwithin a month,\none perceives the *qi* between the kidneys surge and emerge.\nBecause one sits upright in stillness,\nand again extracts it with mental concentration,\nunable to cease or release it,\nthis *qi* cannot descend smoothly\nbut instead ascends in reverse.\nThe Dao of the elixir lies in this “**reverse**” character—\ndescending into the ordinary mother yields the embryo,\nascending to receive the numinous mother yields the elixir.\nWhen the external kidneys do not raise,\nit is proof that *Yáng qi* is not flowing.\nThis is the extraction without extraction,\nknown as **refining yin essence into true *qi* (炼阴精而化真气)**.\n\nMoreover, when humans consume the five grains and various flavors,\nthe turbid transforms into dregs,\nthe pure transforms into saliva,\nand saliva further refines into **yin essence (阴精)**.\nIf yin essence is not refined,\nit spawns errant thoughts and lustful desires.\nOnly with the natural wind of the *Dān Tián* (丹田),\nblowing upon the true fire within,\nfire below and water above—\nwhen water is steamed by fire,\nit naturally transforms into *qi* and ascends,\npenetrating every orifice of the body,\nthis is called **refining yin essence into true *qi* (炼阴精而化真气)**.\n\n**Chapter Ten: On Sexual Union**\nOnce one perceives the kidney’s water ascending,\none then directs the heart’s *qi* to descend.\nThe heart’s *qi* is called **mercury (汞)**,\nas wood generates fire,\nand it is also named **Green Dragon (青龙)**.\nWhen the heart’s *qi* descends,\nwater and fire meet and unite—\nthe two *qi* of the heart and kidneys\nnaturally engage in sexual union,\nthe embodied union of male and female within the body.\nUsing the mind as the intermediary,\none employs mental concentration to draw them together—\nthe mind is the central earth,\nalso called **wu ji yu tu (戊己土)**.\n\nWhat is called sexual union\nis merely the two *qi* of the heart and kidneys\ncirculating between the heart’s lower region and the kidneys’ upper region,\nthe **mysterious chamber (玄門)** referred to as the **nuptial chamber (洞房)**.\nCirculating a hundred times,\nwith sufficient union,\nthey naturally descend to the **Yellow Palace (黃庭)** (lower *Dān Tián*) to meet.\nWithout fail, nightly union,\nnightly descent to the Yellow Palace,\nthen nightly the original *qi* congeals.\nThe common folk use this to extend their lifespan,\nthe mysterious chamber employs it for cultivation—\nall rely on this *qi* as the **elixir seed (丹頭)**.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: On the River Vehicle**\nWhen the original *qi* accumulates in the *Dān Tián*,\nand there is no path upward,\nit must descend through the *Wěi Liú* (尾闾),\npassing through the *Jiā Jǐ* (夾脊) and reaching the *Yù Zhěn* (玉枕),\nthen the *Ní Wán* (泥丸),\nthus the *qi* flows through the back.\n\nThe descending *qi* further draws the ascending *qi*—\nupward and then downward,\ndownward and then upward—\nthis is the **River Vehicle’s circulation (河车运转)**,\nor as the mysterious chamber says:\n*“夹脊双关透顶门，修行径路此为尊”*\n(“The double closure of the *Jiā Jǐ* (夾脊) pierces the *Dǐng Mén* (顶门),\nthis is the supreme path for cultivation.”)\nIn essence, it is the **Rèn (任) and Dū (督) meridians** that are connected.\nThe **Rèn (任)** meridian begins below the *Zhōng Jí* (中极) and ascends to the throat,\nbelonging to the **sea of yin meridians (阴脉之海)**,\nwhile the **Dū (督)** meridian begins below the lower abdomen and extends to the *Shàng Què Qiáo* (上鹊桥),\nbelonging to the **sea of yang meridians (阳脉之海)**.\nWhen these two meridians connect,\nall hundred meridians connect as well.\nIt is also said:\n*“皆在心内运天经”*\n(“All are governed by circulating the **Heavenly Classics (天经)** within the heart”),\nand *“昼夜存之可长生”*\n(“Preserving them day and night can yield longevity”).\nAfter circulation,\nthe *qi* again descends to the Yellow Palace,\nand one naturally feels that *qi* resides within the Yellow Palace.\nWith the heart constantly attending to it—\nthis is called **heart and breath interdependence (心息相依)**,\nor **concentrating the spirit into the *qi* orifice (凝神入气穴)**.\n\nWhether standing, sitting, or lying down,\none’s attention remains unshifted—\nthe spirit and *qi* naturally congeal.\nOnce the *qi* returns to the center,\nthe breath through the nose becomes subtle—\nthis is the saying:\n*“调息要调真息息”*\n(“Regulating the breath must regulate the true, subtle breath”).\n\n**Chapter Twelve: On Extracting True Yang *Qi***\nThe Dao of the elixir must be practiced\nwhen the night’s *qi* has not yet dissipated—\nmerely congealing the spirit and gathering the *qi*,\nsitting upright for a short while,\nsoon the spirit and *qi* return to their roots,\nnaturally yielding **the void giving rise to the one (无中生有)**,\ngradually congealing and gathering,\nproducing a cluster of *Yáng qi*.\n\nHearing the methods of the **immortal ones (至人)** for regulating breath and nourishing nature,\nthey are nothing but the circulation of essence and *qi* throughout the body,\nrefining the **yin *qi* of the entire body (一身之阴气)**.\nIf, in stillness and motionlessness,\none still perceives movement,\nthen one extracts it as per the method—\nat this time, one must further observe and concentrate the spirit\nto assist the fire’s work.\n\nEven without waiting three months,\nwhether in quiet sitting or upon awakening,\none feels a surging, harmonizing *qi* in the abdomen,\nascending and striking unpredictably—\nthis is the movement of **true yang *qi* (真阳之气)**.\n\n「At once, with subtle intent,\none draws this **true yang *qi*** into the crown,\nalong the central path—\nthis is what is called *“inverted progression, counteracting measures, to ascend the crown (倒行逆施，以能升顶)”*.\n\nThen, from the crown,\none guides it back to the abdomen,\nand from the abdomen,\none directs it into the **tail gate (尾闾关)**.\nRepeating this process several times,\nin mere moments of practice,\nonce attained, it is forever secured—\nfor the *qi* now flows ceaselessly on its own.\n\n**Thirteen: On the Convergence of Celestial and Terrestrial *Qi* (真气)**\nIt is further said:\nOne who can **plunder the true *qi* of Heaven and Earth (夺天地之真气)** may achieve longevity.\nThe method is to sit in quietude at a high place in the morning,\nfacing the sun,\nand to **cultivate the vision (存想)** of the sun encompassing one’s body,\ntransforming one’s entire form into the sun.\nWithout thought or desire,\nin a state of **indistinct cosmic unity (混混沌沌)**,\nthe *qi* of Heaven and Earth gradually converges into one’s own body.\nAlternatively, one may face the sun at all times—\nwhen the sun is in the east, the eyes turn east;\nwhen the sun is in the west, the eyes turn west.\nThe key is that one’s body **embraces the sun (相抱)** in continuous rotation,\nthus attaining its essence.\nThe same applies when converging with the moon’s *qi*.\n\n**Fourteen: On Drawing Heaven and Earth’s *Qi***\nYet, after long **concentration of the one (凝一)**,\nthe *qi* continues to circulate and cycle endlessly.\nThe **nose’s breath *qi* (鼻息之气)** draws in Heaven and Earth’s *qi*,\nwhich enters through the nose\nand merges with the **ancestral *qi* of the kidneys (肾中之祖气)**,\nblending seamlessly into a single movement.\nThus, the human *qi* gradually aligns with that of Heaven and Earth,\nserving as the foundation for future **refinement of *qi* and transformation of spirit (炼气化神)**.\nIt replenishes one’s **depleted true *qi* (凿丧之真气)**,\nas said: *“When bamboo is broken, bamboo is used to mend it (竹破以竹补)”*.\nMoreover, this **fusion (融化)** dissolves ordinary **essence (凡精)**,\ngiving rise to **true *qi* (真气)**.\nWhen the true *qi* is abundant,\nspirit naturally transforms,\nfilling one’s inner and outer being completely.\n\n**Fifteen: On Obtaining the Elixir (丹)**\nIf one seeks to obtain the elixir,\none must **forsake the world and attain great stillness (弃世大静)**.\nFor **minor stillness (小静)**, three days suffice;\nfor **moderate stillness (中静)**, five days;\nfor **great stillness (大静)**, seven days.\nWithin stillness, movement naturally arises—\nthis is called *“the dead revive themselves (人死自活)”*,\nand at this moment, one relies entirely on the **support of Dao companions (道友)**.\n\n*“Chaos and Primordial Unity (混沌鸿蒙), yin and yang paired (牝牡相从)”*—\n**Primordial Unity (鸿蒙)** refers to the state before *qi* differentiation,\n**paired (相从)** means yin and yang are mingled without separation.\nWhen they have not yet parted,\nspirit condenses and *qi* gathers,\nmerging into an undivided whole.\nInternally, one perceives no distinction within the body;\nexternally, one perceives no distinction in the cosmos.\nOne becomes **as one with the Dao (与道为一)**,\nall concerns vanish,\nin a **boundless, tranquil void (溟溟滓滓)**—\nindescribable, yet forced to name it *“Great Unity Embracing True *Qi* (太乙含真气)”*,\nor *“Primordial One *Qi* (先天一气)”*,\nthe **mother of the gold elixir (金丹之母)**.\n\nModern practitioners, ignorant of the **Dao’s origin (大道之祖)**,\nmistakenly claim **true lead (真铅)** as primordial,\nor **Heaven’s One generating water (天一生水)** as primordial,\nor the **luminous clarity between the kidneys (两肾中间灵明处)** as primordial—\nnone of these are the **Dao’s true primordial state**.\n\nIt is further said:\n*“Plunder the undifferentiated *qi* of Primordial Unity (采鸿蒙未判之气),\nand seize the paired essence of the Dragon and Tiger (夺龙虎始媾之精).”*\n\n**Seal it within the Yellow Chamber (闭入黄房)**,\nrefine it into the **supreme treasure (至宝)**.\nWhen **still and motionless (寂然不动)**,\nthe heart **communicates with Heaven (与天通)**,\nand one may **plunder the transformative power of the cosmos (造化)**.\n\nIt is further said:\n*“Do not seek the cosmos’s transformative work in the kidneys,\nbut find it in the heart’s practice (不向肾中求造化，\n却于心里觅工夫).”*\n\nDiligently applying this,\none may **ride alongside Zhong and Lü (钟吕)**.*",

On the Three Treasures and Three Essentials**\nCultivation has three treasures and three essentials. The three treasures are *jing*, *qi*, and *shen*.\n*Jing* is the primordial *yuan-yang* of the prenatal essence;\n*Qi* is the ancestral *qi* of the body before birth;\n*Shen* is nature, bestowed by Heaven.\nThese three refined substances are the supreme medicines:\nRefine *jing* to transform into *qi*,\nRefine *qi* to transform into *shen*,\nRefine *shen* to attain the Dao.\nThe three essentials are:\nFirst, the *dinglu* (cauldron-furnace), though named variably, is in truth the single *xuan-guan* (mysterious pass);\nSecond, the *yao-wu* (medicinal substance), though named variably, is in truth the prenatal *qi*;\nThird, the *huo-hou* (fire timing), though named variably, is in truth the wondrous application of the original *shen*.\n\n**II. On the Three Passes and Three Fields**\nThe three passes—*wei-lu* (tail pass), *jia-ji* (intervertebral), and *yu-zhen* (jade pillow)—lie along the *du mai* (governing vessel), belonging to *yang*.\nThe three fields—upper *dan-tian* (elixir field), middle *dan-tian*, and lower *dan-tian*—lie along the *ren mai* (conception vessel), belonging to *yin*.\nThese are the paths of *yin-yang* ascent and descent:\nFrom the *du mai* behind, ascending from the child (*zi*), and from the *ren mai* before, descending to the noon (*wu*), forming the *zi-wu* (child-noon) circulation—the so-called *zhou-tian* (microcosmic orbit) fire timing.\n\nNow on the three passes:\nThe *wei-lu* pass is at the base of the spine, where the vertebrae end, its passage connecting to the inner kidney orifice.\nStraight above, at the inner kidney’s corresponding point on the spine, is the *jia-ji* double pass.\nFurther upward to the back of the head is the *yu-zhen* pass.\nThese three passes open a single marrow path, called *cao-xi* (canal creek) or *huang-he* (Yellow River), the route by which *yang qi* ascends.\n\nNext, the three fields:\nThe *ni-wan* (mud pellet) is the upper *dan-tian*, its orifice three *cun* inward from the midpoint between the brows, circular with a diameter of one *cun* and two *fen*, a hollow point where *shen* resides.\nThree *cun* and six *fen* below the heart is the *tu-fu* (earth furnace), the Yellow Court Palace—this is the middle *dan-tian*, circular with a diameter of one *cun* and two *fen*, also a hollow point where *qi* resides, the cauldron for elixir refinement.\nDirectly below, opposite the navel, approximately three *cun* and six *fen* distant—hence the saying, *\"Thirty-six above heaven, thirty-six below earth.\"* From heaven to earth, eighty-four thousand *li*; from heart to kidney, eight *cun* and four *fen*—three *cun* and six *fen* for the heavenly heart, three *cun* and six *fen* for the earthly kidney, and one *cun* and two *fen* for the middle *dan-tian*—what else could it be?\nBehind the navel, before the kidneys, lies the *yan-yue-lu* (reclining crescent furnace), also called *qi-hai* (sea of *qi*).\nOne *cun* and three *fen* lower is the *hua-chi* (flower pool), also the lower *dan-tian*, circular with a diameter of one *cun* and two *fen*, another hollow point where *jing* resides and medicinal substances are gathered.\nHere are two orifices: one above leading to the inner kidney, one below leading to the *wei-lu* pass. Between them lies the *xuan-guan* (mysterious pass), a void within substance, where the single *yi-qi* (original *qi*) emerges—when the *xuan-guan* opens, the pass is born.\n\n**III. On the Eight Extraordinary Vessels**\nThe eight vessels are:\nThe *chong mai* (penetrating vessel) below the *feng-fu* (wind palace) orifice,\nThe *du mai* (governing vessel) behind the navel,\nThe *ren mai* (conception vessel) before the navel,\nThe *dai mai* (girdle vessel) at the waist,\nThe *yin-jiao mai* (yin linking vessel) before the *wei-lu* pass, below the scrotum,\nThe *yang-jiao mai* (yang linking vessel) two nodes behind the *wei-lu* pass,\nThe *yin-wei mai* (yin maintaining vessel) one *cun* and three *fen* before the crown,\nThe *yang-wei mai* (yang maintaining vessel) one *cun* and three *fen* behind the crown.\nAll eight vessels belong to the *yin shen* (dark spirit) in mortals, sealed and unopened—only immortals, through *yang qi*, can burst them open, thus attaining the Dao.\nThese eight vessels are the roots of the primordial Dao, the origin of the single *qi*.\nTo gather them, begin with the *yin-jiao mai*—when this vessel moves, all vessels open.\nNext are the *du mai*, *ren mai*, and *chong mai*, the sources of the twelve primary channels’ transformations.\nThe *yin-jiao mai* alone connects above to the *ni-wan* and below to the *yong-quan* (gushing spring).\nIf one understands this, directing the true *qi* to gather and disperse through this pass, the heavenly gate remains open, the earthly gate forever sealed, and the *di mai* (tail vessel) circulates through the body, piercing above and below. Harmonious *qi* ascends naturally, *yang* grows while *yin* wanes—*\"The celestial root and lunar cavern move freely; thirty-six palaces bloom with spring.\"* Those who attain this are light and agile, their youth restored, their minds dazed as if drunk or mad—this is the proof.\n\n**IV. On the Water-Fire of *Kan* and *Li***\nBefore birth, a single point of congealing essence is pure chaos, the nature of life.\nAt three months, the *xuan-pin* (mysterious female) forms, the navel like a gourd’s stem, the child in the womb breathing with the mother.\nAfter birth, the navel cord is severed—heaven and earth invert, and the single true *yang* condenses at the navel.\n*Kan* (water) transforms into *Li* (fire), *Kun* (earth) transforms into *Kan*—thus the *shen* departs, the *qi* shifts, no longer guarding the prenatal breath.\nThe breath unguarded means the heart fire belongs to *Li*, like mercury seeking flight, while thoughts of emptiness and meditation further sever its connection with kidney water.\nKidney water belongs to *Kan*, like lead seeking descent, while emotional agitation weakens its hold, further severing its connection with heart fire.\nKidney remains kidney, heart remains heart—water and fire separate, their ascent and descent unrestrained, *Kan* and *Li* unable to invert.\nNot only does the elixir fail to form, but disease arises—how could there be true life?\n\nFurther on *tai-xi* (embryonic breathing):\nIf inhalation is not governed by *shen*, the breath is incomplete;\nIf exhalation is not governed by *shen*, the breath is also incomplete.\nIf each breath returns to its root, interfacing with the prenatal original *qi*, *shen* enters *qi*, *qi* envelops *shen*—like the child in the womb breathing—this is *tai-xi*.\nFor breathing is *qi*, *shen* is the heart—governing *qi* with *shen*, preserving form with *qi*, and governing *qi* with *shen* to attain the Dao—this is to refine the medicinal substance with fire to form the elixir.\"",

      "original_text": "五、论呼吸 诀曰：气是添年药，心为使气神； 能知神气祖，便是得仙人。 盖呼吸所从起者也，呼为父母元气，吸为天地正气。 令气合形，神合气，则命在我矣。 凡人不知收藏呼吸之地，强闭出入，与死静者无异。 又或任其出入，则元气随呼气而出，反为天地所夺。 是以有抽添之说，使气之呼吸至于根蒂。 吸自外而内，呼之亦入内，吸则来于子宫玉洞，呼则直上昆仑巅顶，呼吸旋为一气，成为胎息。 虽然，一气如何至此？ 盖呼吸久，但觉有一吸至于内，久之而并不觉气急，犹子在母腹时，即为胎息也。 但凡人只知吸之在内,不知呼之亦在内，知之则可夺天地之正气矣,而后方谓之“添年药”。 六、论玄窍 又曰：汝欲内呼吸,汝当得其一,则万事毕。 一之为物,有两窍,两窍又止一窍。 此一窍也，无内外，无边际，中有乾坤理五气、合百神，此根蒂之处、结胎之所，性命始于此，精气神俱生于此。 及吾生身受气之初，父母精气相交之顷，流注一线之路，其中似有一管相通，故曰无孔笛，没口人吹也。 有此管，然后生肾，生诸脏腑，一身经脉，皆从此生，又曰总持门，曰三关要路。 在母腹时，吸至此窍，合天降，呼从此窍，合地升，又名为龟鼻头，惟此一窍，乃内呼吸之根蒂，先天元气实游于此，天地正气实从此入。 人以命门为玄，肾堂为牝，此处立基，谬之千里矣。 不知玄牝乃天地之根，在西南坤地，脐后肾前，而又非脐下一寸三分，亦非两肾间之空窍。 此乃真窍，能得而知。 上通泥丸，下透涌泉，中接心肾，内虚而直，不可形求，不可意取。 先天真种实藏于此，通天地，通神圣，得则生矣，失则死矣，“真人之息以踵”者此也。 此天仙下手处，舍此而下，酆都九幽者也。 七、论塞兑垂帘 塞兑者，口开神气散，故塞之也。 垂帘者，眼全开神漏，全闭神昏，惟垂帘微启耳。 两眼之中即天根，即所谓性命关也。 其根生于眼，眼属心，心生造化，自属玄之又玄者，仙家谓之玄牝之门。 心肾内日月，交接于内，两眼外日月，交接于外，攒簇水火而不散，气自调矣。 八、论回光调息 欲明回光调息，须知观音常之妙用。 观音堂者何？ 观属眼，音属耳，眼属心，耳属肾，心肾相接处，为观音堂，主持一身神气者也。 其法自两眼角收心一处，收到两眼中间，以一身心神，尽收此处，所谓“乾坤大地一起收来”是也。 心定之后，自此用眼下看鼻尖，直下看到脐下。 眼常在此处，寂然不动，任鼻呼吸，调息绵绵，若存若亡。 不假工夫，则真息自调，“息不由于鼻外，思维止于身中”。 正谓此耳。 又曰“蟾光终日照西川，即此便是药之根。 ”蟾光即眼光也，西川即脐下坤地也。 如此回光于脐下，以调真息，是神入气穴。 回光日久，肾中一点真阳，上与心神相合，则心息相依(内息者气也)，心息相依则水火既济。 回光调息工夫，遇静即行，不拘子午，十二时中皆可为。 即行功时，意失便收来，所谓“放去收来总是伊”。 是工用久，心内自悟，五贼先去，五贼乃眼耳鼻口意。 眼不外视而内照，则魂在肝而不从眼漏； 耳不闻声而返听，则精在肾而不从耳漏； 鼻不嗅味而调息，则魄在肺而不从鼻漏； 口不开言而塞兑，则念在脾而不从口漏；",
      "translated_text": "Five, on Breathing, the Essential Method says:\n*Qi* is the medicine that extends life, the heart is the sovereign that commands *qi*;\nIf one knows the origin of *shen* and *qi*, then one has attained the Dao of the Immortals.\nFor breathing is where *qi* arises—\nthe exhalation is the *qi* of parents, the inhalation is the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\nWhen *qi* aligns with form and *shen* with *qi*, then life is in our grasp.\nOrdinary people do not know where to store and govern their breathing—\nforcibly closing its entry and exit is no different from the stillness of death.\nOr they let it flow freely, and then the original *qi* departs with the exhalation,\nonly to be seized by Heaven and Earth.\nThus arises the teaching of \"drawing and adding\" *qi*,\nto bring the breath to its root and foundation.\nInhalation comes from outside to within,\nexhalation also returns inward—\ninhalation gathers at the childlike *yu-dong* (玉洞) of the womb,\nexhalation ascends straight to the peak of *Kunlun* (昆仑).\nBreathing then circulates as a single *qi*, forming the embryonic breath (*tai-xi*).\nBut how does one breath become this?\n\nWith prolonged breathing,\none may notice an inhalation reaching within,\nyet over time, one does not feel breathlessness—\njust as the child breathes in the mother’s womb,\nso it is embryonic breath (*tai-xi*).\nYet ordinary people only know inhalation is within,\nunaware that exhalation is also within.\nKnowing this, one can reclaim the *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nand only then may it be called the \"medicine that extends life.\"\n\nSix, on the Mysterious Aperture, it is further said:\nYou wish to practice internal breathing?\nYou must grasp its singular essence,\nand then all matters are complete.\nThis singular essence is one aperture,\nthough it contains two orifices—\ntwo orifices yet are but one aperture.\nThis aperture has no inside or outside,\nno boundary—\nwithin it, the *Dao* of *Kan* and *Li* (乾坤) harmonizes the Five *Qi* (五氣),\nand unites the Hundred *Shen* (百神).\nHere lies the root and foundation,\nthe place where the embryonic breath is sealed—\nlife and essence begin here,\nand *jing-qi-shen* (精氣神) all arise from this.\nAt the moment of my birth, when the *qi* of my parents first mingled,\na single thread flowed through this aperture,\nas if a pipe without holes—\na flute blown by a faceless one.\nWith this pipe, the kidneys form,\nand all the viscera and bowels,\nthe meridians of the body,\nall arise from here—\nalso called the *Total Support Gate* (總持門),\nthe *Three Pass Key Route* (三關要路).\nIn the mother’s womb,\ninhalation gathers here, uniting with Heaven’s descent,\nexhalation arises from here, uniting with Earth’s ascent—\nalso named the *Tortoise’s Nasal Tip* (龜鼻頭).\nOnly this aperture is the root of internal breathing,\nwhere the original prenatal *qi* truly dwells,\nand where the *qi* of Heaven and Earth truly enters.\nPeople mistakenly take the *Command Gate* (命門) as the Mysterious,\nand the *Kidney Chamber* (腎堂) as the Feminine—\nthis is a thousand leagues from the truth.\nThe Mysterious and the Feminine are the roots of Heaven and Earth,\nlocated in the southwest *Kun* (坤) land,\nbehind the navel, before the kidneys—\nyet it is neither the aperture a *cun* below the navel,\nnor the hollow between the two kidneys.\nThis is the true aperture,\nable to be obtained and known.\nIt connects above with the *Níhuán* (泥丸),\npenetrates below to the *Yǒngquán* (涌泉),\nand in the middle interfaces with the heart and kidneys—\nhollow and straight within,\nunfindable by form or graspable by thought.\nThe true prenatal seed is stored here,\nconnecting Heaven and Earth,\nconnecting the divine and the sacred—\nto obtain it is life,\nto lose it is death.\nThis is where the Heavenly Immortals begin their practice;\nto abandon this is to descend into the *Yùdōu* (酆都) and the Nine Abysses (*Jiǔyōu* 九幽).\n\nSeven, on Sealing the *Duì* (兑) and Lowering the Curtain:\nSealing the *Duì* (兑) is to close the mouth and prevent *shen* and *qi* from scattering,\nthus it is sealed.\nLowering the curtain is to keep the eyes half-closed—\nfully open and *shen* leaks out,\nfully closed and *shen* grows dim;\nonly half-closed preserves clarity.\nBetween the two eyes lies the Heavenly Root,\nthe so-called \"life-and-essence gate.\"\nIts root is in the eyes,\neyes belong to the heart,\nthe heart generates transformation—\nthis belongs to the deepest Mysterious,\nthe Immortals call it the \"Gate of the Mysterious Feminine.\"\nWithin, the heart and kidneys are the inner sun and moon,\ninterfacing internally;\nwithout, the two eyes are the outer sun and moon,\ninterfacing externally—\nwhen water and fire gather without dispersing,\n*qi* naturally harmonizes.\n\nEight, on Returning the Light and Regulating the Breath:\nTo clarify the method of returning the light and regulating the breath,\none must know the wondrous function of the *Guān-Yīn Dāng* (觀音堂).\nWhat is the *Guān-Yīn Dāng* (觀音堂)?\n*Guān* belongs to the eyes,\n*yīn* belongs to the ears,\neyes belong to the heart,\nears belong to the kidneys—\nthe place where the heart and kidneys interface\nis the *Guān-Yīn Dāng* (觀音堂),\nwhich governs the *shen* and *qi* of the body.\nIts method is to gather the heart from the two corners of the eyes,\nto the space between them,\nand with the body’s *shen* and *qi*,\nto fully gather here—\nthis is the saying, \"Gather the entire *Kan* and *Li* (乾坤) of the great earth.\"\nWhen the heart is settled,\nfrom here, gaze downward at the tip of the nose,\nstraight down to the navel below.\nLet the eyes remain here,\nstill and unmoving,\nas the nose breathes—\nregulating the breath gently,\nas if present or as if absent.\nWithout effort,\nthe true breath will naturally regulate itself—\n\"the breath does not depend on the nose’s exterior,\nthought ceases within the body.\"\nThis is precisely the meaning.\nIt is further said:\n\"The toad’s light shines all day upon the western river—\nthis is the root of the medicine.\"\nThe toad’s light is the eye’s light,\nthe western river is the *Kun* (坤) land below the navel.\nThus, returning the light to the navel below,\nto regulate the true breath,\nis for the *shen* to enter the *qi* aperture.\nWith prolonged returning of the light,\na single point of true *yang* (陽) forms in the kidneys,\nascending to merge with the heart’s *shen*—\nthen the heart’s breath and the *qi*’s breath depend on each other (for internal breath is *qi*).\nWhen the heart’s breath and the *qi*’s breath depend on each other,\nwater and fire are both fulfilled.\nThe practice of returning the light and regulating the breath\nmust be done when stillness is encountered,\nwithout regard for *zi-wǔ* (子午),\nand may be performed in all twelve hours.\nWhen practicing,\nif the mind wanders, gather it back—\nthis is the saying, \"Release and return are all in its grasp.\"\nWith prolonged practice,\none’s heart naturally awakens—\nthe Five Bandits depart first.\nThe Five Bandits are the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and mind.\nWhen the eyes do not gaze outward but inwardly illuminate,\nthe soul abides in the liver and does not leak from the eyes;\nWhen the ears do not hear sounds but listen in return,\nthe essence abides in the kidneys and does not leak from the ears;\nWhen the nose does not sniff scents but regulates the breath,\nthe *pò* (魄) abides in the lungs and does not leak from the nose;\nWhen the mouth does not speak and seals the *Duì* (兑),\nthe thought abides in the spleen and does not leak from the mouth;",
      "overlap_context": "hen*, the breath is incomplete;\nIf exhalation is not governed by *shen*, the breath is also incomplete.\nIf each breath returns to its root, interfacing with the prenatal original *qi*, *shen* enters *qi*, *qi* envelops *shen*—like the child in the womb breathing—this is *tai-xi*.\nFor breathing is *qi*, *shen* is the heart—governing *qi* with *shen*, preserving form with *qi*, and governing *qi* with *shen* to attain the Dao—this is to refine the medicinal substance with fire to form the elixir.\"",

It is the original *qi* of my body.\nOriginal *qi* flows through the channels of *qìxiě* (氣血),\nand thus the ears can hear, the eyes can see,\nthe hands can grasp, and the feet can walk.\nYet, though humans live,\nit is the original *qi* that sustains them—\nthus, it is forcefully named “**Mìng** (命),” while the heart contains the spirit,\nforcefully named “**Xìng** (性).”\nThe interplay of spirit and *qi*,\nthe union of nature and life,\nis why it is called “**double cultivation**.”\nThe effort lies solely in the “double” character.\nWhen the heart’s fire ascends and the kidney’s water leaks downward,\nthey no longer unite—\nthus, cultivating nature must also cultivate life.\n\nThe Dao of double cultivation has no other secret:\nIt is merely taking the *qi* from the kidneys\nto unite with the spirit within the heart.\n\n**The Method for Extracting *Qi*:**\nThe spine has twenty-one vertebrae;\ncounting from below upward,\nthe seventh vertebra is where the two kidneys reside.\nWhen *Tian Yi* (天一) generates water,\nafter the *Zǐ* (子) hour at night,\none *Yáng* (陽) begins to arise,\nand the body’s original *qi*,\nfrom the *Wěi Liú* (尾闾) acupoint,\nascends from below to the kidneys.\nBetween the two kidneys lies an orifice,\nright at the center of the seventh vertebra,\nfrom which the original *qi* issues forth,\nsurging and striking the *Yáng Guān* (陽關).\nThus, when a person sleeps past midnight in the *Zǐ* hour,\nthe external kidneys raise *Yáng*.\nIf *Yáng* does not raise itself,\nit is the *qi* from the internal kidney orifice that surges outward,\nraising the external kidneys.\n\nAt the moment when the internal kidney’s *Yáng qi* is about to reach the external kidneys,\none may undress and sit upright,\nlowering the gaze and sealing the lips,\nregulating the breath softly and continuously,\nwhile visualizing between the two kidneys—\nas if *qi* emerges from there,\nthis *qi* is called **lead (铅)**,\nthe gold within water,\nalso named **White Tiger (白虎)**.\nNightly, one practices this technique,\nand only then retires to sleep.\n\nThe kidney’s channels connect with the heart;\nwhen the lower *qi* stirs, the upper responds—\nwithin a month,\none perceives the *qi* between the kidneys surge and emerge.\nBecause one sits upright in stillness,\nand again extracts it with mental concentration,\nunable to cease or release it,\nthis *qi* cannot descend smoothly\nbut instead ascends in reverse.\nThe Dao of the elixir lies in this “**reverse**” character—\ndescending into the ordinary mother yields the embryo,\nascending to receive the numinous mother yields the elixir.\nWhen the external kidneys do not raise,\nit is proof that *Yáng qi* is not flowing.\nThis is the extraction without extraction,\nknown as **refining yin essence into true *qi* (炼阴精而化真气)**.\n\nMoreover, when humans consume the five grains and various flavors,\nthe turbid transforms into dregs,\nthe pure transforms into saliva,\nand saliva further refines into **yin essence (阴精)**.\nIf yin essence is not refined,\nit spawns errant thoughts and lustful desires.\nOnly with the natural wind of the *Dān Tián* (丹田),\nblowing upon the true fire within,\nfire below and water above—\nwhen water is steamed by fire,\nit naturally transforms into *qi* and ascends,\npenetrating every orifice of the body,\nthis is called **refining yin essence into true *qi* (炼阴精而化真气)**.\n\n**Chapter Ten: On Sexual Union**\nOnce one perceives the kidney’s water ascending,\none then directs the heart’s *qi* to descend.\nThe heart’s *qi* is called **mercury (汞)**,\nas wood generates fire,\nand it is also named **Green Dragon (青龙)**.\nWhen the heart’s *qi* descends,\nwater and fire meet and unite—\nthe two *qi* of the heart and kidneys\nnaturally engage in sexual union,\nthe embodied union of male and female within the body.\nUsing the mind as the intermediary,\none employs mental concentration to draw them together—\nthe mind is the central earth,\nalso called **wu ji yu tu (戊己土)**.\n\nWhat is called sexual union\nis merely the two *qi* of the heart and kidneys\ncirculating between the heart’s lower region and the kidneys’ upper region,\nthe **mysterious chamber (玄門)** referred to as the **nuptial chamber (洞房)**.\nCirculating a hundred times,\nwith sufficient union,\nthey naturally descend to the **Yellow Palace (黃庭)** (lower *Dān Tián*) to meet.\nWithout fail, nightly union,\nnightly descent to the Yellow Palace,\nthen nightly the original *qi* congeals.\nThe common folk use this to extend their lifespan,\nthe mysterious chamber employs it for cultivation—\nall rely on this *qi* as the **elixir seed (丹頭)**.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: On the River Vehicle**\nWhen the original *qi* accumulates in the *Dān Tián*,\nand there is no path upward,\nit must descend through the *Wěi Liú* (尾闾),\npassing through the *Jiā Jǐ* (夾脊) and reaching the *Yù Zhěn* (玉枕),\nthen the *Ní Wán* (泥丸),\nthus the *qi* flows through the back.\n\nThe descending *qi* further draws the ascending *qi*—\nupward and then downward,\ndownward and then upward—\nthis is the **River Vehicle’s circulation (河车运转)**,\nor as the mysterious chamber says:\n*“夹脊双关透顶门，修行径路此为尊”*\n(“The double closure of the *Jiā Jǐ* (夾脊) pierces the *Dǐng Mén* (顶门),\nthis is the supreme path for cultivation.”)\nIn essence, it is the **Rèn (任) and Dū (督) meridians** that are connected.\nThe **Rèn (任)** meridian begins below the *Zhōng Jí* (中极) and ascends to the throat,\nbelonging to the **sea of yin meridians (阴脉之海)**,\nwhile the **Dū (督)** meridian begins below the lower abdomen and extends to the *Shàng Què Qiáo* (上鹊桥),\nbelonging to the **sea of yang meridians (阳脉之海)**.\nWhen these two meridians connect,\nall hundred meridians connect as well.\nIt is also said:\n*“皆在心内运天经”*\n(“All are governed by circulating the **Heavenly Classics (天经)** within the heart”),\nand *“昼夜存之可长生”*\n(“Preserving them day and night can yield longevity”).\nAfter circulation,\nthe *qi* again descends to the Yellow Palace,\nand one naturally feels that *qi* resides within the Yellow Palace.\nWith the heart constantly attending to it—\nthis is called **heart and breath interdependence (心息相依)**,\nor **concentrating the spirit into the *qi* orifice (凝神入气穴)**.\n\nWhether standing, sitting, or lying down,\none’s attention remains unshifted—\nthe spirit and *qi* naturally congeal.\nOnce the *qi* returns to the center,\nthe breath through the nose becomes subtle—\nthis is the saying:\n*“调息要调真息息”*\n(“Regulating the breath must regulate the true, subtle breath”).\n\n**Chapter Twelve: On Extracting True Yang *Qi***\nThe Dao of the elixir must be practiced\nwhen the night’s *qi* has not yet dissipated—\nmerely congealing the spirit and gathering the *qi*,\nsitting upright for a short while,\nsoon the spirit and *qi* return to their roots,\nnaturally yielding **the void giving rise to the one (无中生有)**,\ngradually congealing and gathering,\nproducing a cluster of *Yáng qi*.\n\nHearing the methods of the **immortal ones (至人)** for regulating breath and nourishing nature,\nthey are nothing but the circulation of essence and *qi* throughout the body,\nrefining the **yin *qi* of the entire body (一身之阴气)**.\nIf, in stillness and motionlessness,\none still perceives movement,\nthen one extracts it as per the method—\nat this time, one must further observe and concentrate the spirit\nto assist the fire’s work.\n\nEven without waiting three months,\nwhether in quiet sitting or upon awakening,\none feels a surging, harmonizing *qi* in the abdomen,\nascending and striking unpredictably—\nthis is the movement of **true yang *qi* (真阳之气)**.",
