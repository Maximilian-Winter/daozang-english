How profound these words!\n\nThus, only when principle is refined can it enter spirit and be applied; only when application is beneficial can the self be secured and virtue exalted. If principle is unrefined yet one claims to apply it, or if application is unbeneficial yet one claims to secure the self—how could one who fails to secure the self be said to know the Dao? Never has such a thing existed.\n\nNow, the subtle application [of the Dao] is the master of generation and transformation. When essence and qi coalesce into things, it is called *\"yielding harmony.\"* Silent and unquestioning, it yet stands in accord with all existence. Does not the great virtue of Heaven and Earth daily renew itself therein?\n\nTo preserve one’s embodied life, one must minimize thought and desire, embrace simplicity to seek harmony, let the mind wander in stillness, and merge qi with the void.

By purifying the mind and concealing its depths, exhausting spirit to comprehend transformation—only then can the self be secured and the state preserved, virtue applied without the people’s awareness. Thus, Heaven aids such a one, and no fortune is not attained.\n\nUpon reverently studying this scripture’s five chapters, [I find] they encompass the essentials of cultivating the self and safeguarding life: preserving harmony to embrace the One, refining principle to enter spirit, sitting in forgetfulness to cast off reflection, securing the self to exalt virtue. As I have pondered and savored them over time, I have ventured to provide annotations.\n\nYour servant, though lowly as grass and reeds, has been graced with profound imperial favor. The light of Heaven does not forsake me, and I have forgotten my own coarseness. Prostrating in awe and trepidation, I hesitate as though lost. With utmost reverence, I bow my head, bow my head, and humbly submit these words.\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on *Laozi’s Five Kitchens Scripture***\n**Annotated by Yin Qia of the Jing Suming Abbey, Tang Dynasty**\n\nThe preservation of the One and the harmony of Supreme Harmony fill the Five Viscera to abundance and settle the Five Spirits in stillness and rectitude. When the Five Viscera are full, flavors suffice; when the Five Spirits are still, cravings vanish. This scripture is the source from which the Five Viscera draw sustenance—like seeking food from the kitchen, hence it is called the *Five Kitchens*.\n\nThe harmony of Supreme Harmony arises from the One Qi. The One Qi is the wondrous root and subtle function, what is called the Primordial Qi. Its subtle function in Heaven becomes Yang Harmony; on Earth, Yin Harmony; their union is Supreme Harmony. Thus, human life is endowed with the harmony of the One Qi to form Supreme Harmony, after which physical form is complete and the Five Constants are put to use. Therefore, Laozi says: \"The myriad things bear Yin and embrace Yang, and through the blending of qi they achieve harmony.\"\n\nTo guard the root, one must externally sever the two receptivities to preserve the allotment of life, and internally preserve the One Radiance to harmonize Supreme Harmony. When harmony and the One are united, one’s nature and life are whole. Thus, Laozi says: \"Concentrate your radiance, attain softness—can you be like an infant?\"\n\nAll under the Dao attain Supreme Harmony through the One. To attain the One is to say: internally preserve the One Radiance to nourish the spirit, and externally preserve the physical form to dwell in Supreme Harmony. Then the One Radiance and its subtle function harmonize with the Supreme Harmony within the body—hence it is called \"attaining the One.\" In this way, the Way of cultivating life and nurturing the spirit all accords with Supreme Harmony. Thus, Laozi says: \"The myriad things attain the One and thereby live.\"\n\nHarmony is ultimately without a single harmony. When one first perceives the One Radiance to harmonize Supreme Harmony, if harmony is preserved and the One attained, then the principle of harmony is all-pervading. When Supreme Harmony flows unimpeded, not only is there no One, but there is also no harmony—it cannot be governed by discourse, like earth falling to the ground. Thus, Laozi says: \"I do not know its name.\"\n\nThe mysterious principle is one with the mysterious realm. *Xuan* means wondrous; *li* means nature. This speaks of the One Radiance existing within the mysterious realm of harmony, where principle emerges from nature. When nature is cultivated and returns to power, the wondrous flows unimpeded in harmony. When the wondrous nature is harmonized, it becomes one with the mysterious realm. Thus, Laozi says: \"This is called the mysterious.\"\n\nDo not think with thoughts. *Yi* means contemplation and attachment. To preserve the One Radiance and harmonize Supreme Harmony, one must not entertain thoughts or attachments that follow external conditions and perceptions. Instead, concentrate the spirit and abide in profound clarity, allowing emptiness and stillness to prevail. Let harmony flow before thoughts arise and wisdom manifest after knowledge is forgotten. Gazing upon that which is beyond, auspiciousness comes to rest. If one thinks with thoughts, attaching to perceptions and dust, harmony is scorched—how can purity arise? Thus, Laozi says: \"Block the openings, shut the doors—throughout your life, remain undisturbed.\"\n\nNor should one seek thoughtlessness. Merely refraining from thoughts and attachments allows wisdom to naturally arise. When wisdom arises, one does not perceive it oneself. If one seeks thoughtlessness, this already involves thought and attachment, no different from ordinary thinking. Thus, Laozi says: \"The nameless uncarved block—it too has no desires.\"\n\nThought without the presence of thought. Internally preserving the One Qi, one must only allow it to be empty. Emptiness brings harmony, and the principle of harmony flows unimpeded. Though not following thoughts or attachments to receive harmony, one may forcibly impose a name—yet since it is not stored in perception, there is no thought within it. Laozi says: \"Use its light, return to its clarity.\"\n\nThis Dharma is to be upheld thus. When Supreme Harmony is internally preserved and the Dharma of Supreme Harmony flows unimpeded, then all Dharmas are relinquished. With no Dharma to abide in, what is there to uphold? To uphold by not upholding—thus it is said: \"This Dharma is to be upheld thus.\"\n\nDo not use the mind to follow the mind. The mind is the substance from which wisdom arises and the vessel of thoughts and attachments. Right reception gives rise to wisdom; wrong reception generates thoughts. If one can harmonize qi within and rectify the mind within, with inner illumination clear and cool, then right wisdom abides in stillness. It mirrors brightly, and dust does not settle; it rests profoundly, and the myriad images are all seen. Seeing images without attachment is called the constant mind. If one uses the mind to grasp the mind, following the mind to receive defilement, externally preserving all Dharmas while internally lacking the illumination of wisdom, the constant mind is lost, and the principle of harmony is also impaired. Thus, Zhuangzi says: \"Attain its mind, use its mind—attain its constant mind. What can external things do to you?\"\n\nReturn—do not abide in severing attachments. If one uses the mind to follow the mind, one receives all attachments. If right reception gives rise to wisdom, one naturally attains the constant mind. When the wisdom-mind is constant, there is no reception of the right—what is there to attach to? With no mind to attach to, there is also no severing of attachments. Abiding in profound stillness, where is there to dwell? Thus, Laozi says: \"Reduce it again and again, until you reach non-action.\"\n\nThe mind is present—do not preserve the mind. When wisdom-illumination abides in stillness, one speaks of the mind’s presence. Yet in absolute non-abiding, it is said: do not preserve the mind’s illumination. Since one neither follows nor pursues the mind’s attachments, there is no severing and no abiding. The true is to guard the true abyss. The true refers to the constant mind’s wisdom-illumination, clear and cool, without admixture. If one abides in the profound source of wisdom, still and without defilement, with no Dharma to know and no mind to attach to, then Supreme Harmony contains the true, inherently inseparable—thus it is said: guard it.\n\nCultivate principle, depart from intention. *Li* is nature; *zhi* is the mind’s fixation. If one severs external conditions and receives this mind, then nature is received. To cultivate nature, the mind has its fixations—yet one must attain pervasive illumination. If external dust is already severed and perceptual fixations are absent, departing from form and relinquishing knowledge, one merges with the great penetration. Nature is cultivated and returns to the origin, illuminating all without obstruction. Within and without are both pure, mysterious beyond the mysterious—then one departs from fixated thoughts.\n\nAccumulated cultivation does not accord with departure. If one cultivates nature to depart from intention, then within and without are both still, with no arising or abiding mind, no sitting or acting—each thought arises and each thought ceases. If one accumulates cultivation without forgetting and extinguishing, arousing a single thought of cultivation that draws forth a thousand jun, inner illumination is shaken, and external dust arises—this does not accord with departure from intention.\n\nIntend without cultivating intention.\n\nIf the mind has no point of focus, how can gradual awakening arise? It is precisely through focus that the settled mind is attained—hence it is called *intention*. \"Not cultivating intention\" means to depart from intention without accumulating cultivation; only after forgetting cultivation does nature settle, then stillness and perfect illumination arise.\n\nOne’s karmic activity is without self-knowledge. When the mind is fixed, wisdom’s activity becomes clear and cool—hence it is called *karmic activity*. Forgetting all self within and all things without, in the wisdom-illuminated mind not even the slightest exertion is made, then one naturally forgets knowledge of one’s karmic activity—hence it is called *without self-knowledge*.\n\nAll foods congeal qi. When unified qi coagulates, it harmonizes with supreme harmony; when harmony and unity are complete, then wisdom’s illumination remains ever profound. Now, the mouth takes in flavors to fill the five viscera, the body gathers froth and foam to bear its form, receiving its bodily substance from earth, congealing moisture from water, inheriting heat from fire, relying on breath from wind—these four conditions bind and leak, none being wondrous essence. Thus, the single qi is stained and muddied, supreme harmony is disturbed, and when thoughts and sensations arise, the defilements of movement are born.\n\nNot the long-settled congealment. One should allow supreme harmony to contain unity without thoughts or sensations, guarding the true and constant profundity, then merging with supreme harmony in substance. Now, through the congealment of qi by various foods, it is not the long-settled congealment.\n\nQi returns to the root qi. The four conditions receive perception, the six defilements generate corruption—earth, water, fire, and wind scatter and return to their root. When the root perception is defiled, it follows the karma it has received.\n\nWhat is taken must be discharged accordingly. *Taking* is reception; *discharging* is activation. Thoughts have two kinds of reception, karma has two kinds of response—according to what is received, its signs are activated. If supreme harmony harmonizes with unity, then unified qi is wholly harmonized, leading to that emptiness of the ultimate—this is called *returning to the mandate*. In returning to the mandate, constancy is attained—this is called *right reception*. Right reception produces pure karma, which gives rise to wisdom’s illumination. When wisdom’s illumination is profoundly constant, utterly without anything, then one enters the unquestionable.\n\nThe one: when qi from food returns to the four conditions, karma is complete and one sinks into the six destinies. The *Laozi’s Commentary on the Scripture of the Five Kitchens* concludes here.",

When the Five Viscera are full, flavors suffice; when the Five Spirits are still, cravings vanish. This scripture is the source from which the Five Viscera draw sustenance—like seeking food from the kitchen, hence it is called the *Five Kitchens*.\n\nThe harmony of Supreme Harmony arises from the One Qi. The One Qi is the wondrous root and subtle function, what is called the Primordial Qi. Its subtle function in Heaven becomes Yang Harmony; on Earth, Yin Harmony; their union is Supreme Harmony. Thus, human life is endowed with the harmony of the One Qi to form Supreme Harmony, after which physical form is complete and the Five Constants are put to use. Therefore, Laozi says: \"The myriad things bear Yin and embrace Yang, and through the blending of qi they achieve harmony.\"\n\nTo guard the root, one must externally sever the two receptivities to preserve the allotment of life, and internally preserve the One Radiance to harmonize Supreme Harmony. When harmony and the One are united, one’s nature and life are whole. Thus, Laozi says: \"Concentrate your radiance, attain softness—can you be like an infant?\"\n\nAll under the Dao attain Supreme Harmony through the One. To attain the One is to say: internally preserve the One Radiance to nourish the spirit, and externally preserve the physical form to dwell in Supreme Harmony. Then the One Radiance and its subtle function harmonize with the Supreme Harmony within the body—hence it is called \"attaining the One.\" In this way, the Way of cultivating life and nurturing the spirit all accords with Supreme Harmony. Thus, Laozi says: \"The myriad things attain the One and thereby live.\"\n\nHarmony is ultimately without a single harmony. When one first perceives the One Radiance to harmonize Supreme Harmony, if harmony is preserved and the One attained, then the principle of harmony is all-pervading. When Supreme Harmony flows unimpeded, not only is there no One, but there is also no harmony—it cannot be governed by discourse, like earth falling to the ground. Thus, Laozi says: \"I do not know its name.\"\n\nThe mysterious principle is one with the mysterious realm. *Xuan* means wondrous; *li* means nature. This speaks of the One Radiance existing within the mysterious realm of harmony, where principle emerges from nature. When nature is cultivated and returns to power, the wondrous flows unimpeded in harmony. When the wondrous nature is harmonized, it becomes one with the mysterious realm. Thus, Laozi says: \"This is called the mysterious.\"\n\nDo not think with thoughts. *Yi* means contemplation and attachment. To preserve the One Radiance and harmonize Supreme Harmony, one must not entertain thoughts or attachments that follow external conditions and perceptions. Instead, concentrate the spirit and abide in profound clarity, allowing emptiness and stillness to prevail. Let harmony flow before thoughts arise and wisdom manifest after knowledge is forgotten. Gazing upon that which is beyond, auspiciousness comes to rest. If one thinks with thoughts, attaching to perceptions and dust, harmony is scorched—how can purity arise? Thus, Laozi says: \"Block the openings, shut the doors—throughout your life, remain undisturbed.\"\n\nNor should one seek thoughtlessness. Merely refraining from thoughts and attachments allows wisdom to naturally arise. When wisdom arises, one does not perceive it oneself. If one seeks thoughtlessness, this already involves thought and attachment, no different from ordinary thinking. Thus, Laozi says: \"The nameless uncarved block—it too has no desires.\"\n\nThought without the presence of thought. Internally preserving the One Qi, one must only allow it to be empty. Emptiness brings harmony, and the principle of harmony flows unimpeded. Though not following thoughts or attachments to receive harmony, one may forcibly impose a name—yet since it is not stored in perception, there is no thought within it. Laozi says: \"Use its light, return to its clarity.\"\n\nThis Dharma is to be upheld thus. When Supreme Harmony is internally preserved and the Dharma of Supreme Harmony flows unimpeded, then all Dharmas are relinquished. With no Dharma to abide in, what is there to uphold? To uphold by not upholding—thus it is said: \"This Dharma is to be upheld thus.\"\n\nDo not use the mind to follow the mind. The mind is the substance from which wisdom arises and the vessel of thoughts and attachments. Right reception gives rise to wisdom; wrong reception generates thoughts. If one can harmonize qi within and rectify the mind within, with inner illumination clear and cool, then right wisdom abides in stillness. It mirrors brightly, and dust does not settle; it rests profoundly, and the myriad images are all seen. Seeing images without attachment is called the constant mind. If one uses the mind to grasp the mind, following the mind to receive defilement, externally preserving all Dharmas while internally lacking the illumination of wisdom, the constant mind is lost, and the principle of harmony is also impaired. Thus, Zhuangzi says: \"Attain its mind, use its mind—attain its constant mind. What can external things do to you?\"\n\nReturn—do not abide in severing attachments. If one uses the mind to follow the mind, one receives all attachments. If right reception gives rise to wisdom, one naturally attains the constant mind. When the wisdom-mind is constant, there is no reception of the right—what is there to attach to? With no mind to attach to, there is also no severing of attachments. Abiding in profound stillness, where is there to dwell? Thus, Laozi says: \"Reduce it again and again, until you reach non-action.\"\n\nThe mind is present—do not preserve the mind. When wisdom-illumination abides in stillness, one speaks of the mind’s presence. Yet in absolute non-abiding, it is said: do not preserve the mind’s illumination. Since one neither follows nor pursues the mind’s attachments, there is no severing and no abiding. The true is to guard the true abyss. The true refers to the constant mind’s wisdom-illumination, clear and cool, without admixture. If one abides in the profound source of wisdom, still and without defilement, with no Dharma to know and no mind to attach to, then Supreme Harmony contains the true, inherently inseparable—thus it is said: guard it.\n\nCultivate principle, depart from intention. *Li* is nature; *zhi* is the mind’s fixation. If one severs external conditions and receives this mind, then nature is received. To cultivate nature, the mind has its fixations—yet one must attain pervasive illumination. If external dust is already severed and perceptual fixations are absent, departing from form and relinquishing knowledge, one merges with the great penetration. Nature is cultivated and returns to the origin, illuminating all without obstruction. Within and without are both pure, mysterious beyond the mysterious—then one departs from fixated thoughts.\n\nAccumulated cultivation does not accord with departure. If one cultivates nature to depart from intention, then within and without are both still, with no arising or abiding mind, no sitting or acting—each thought arises and each thought ceases. If one accumulates cultivation without forgetting and extinguishing, arousing a single thought of cultivation that draws forth a thousand jun, inner illumination is shaken, and external dust arises—this does not accord with departure from intention.\n\nIntend without cultivating intention.",

      "translated_text": "If the mind has no point of focus, how can gradual awakening arise? It is precisely through focus that the settled mind is attained—hence it is called *intention*. \"Not cultivating intention\" means to depart from intention without accumulating cultivation; only after forgetting cultivation does nature settle, then stillness and perfect illumination arise.\n\nOne’s karmic activity is without self-knowledge. When the mind is fixed, wisdom’s activity becomes clear and cool—hence it is called *karmic activity*. Forgetting all self within and all things without, in the wisdom-illuminated mind not even the slightest exertion is made, then one naturally forgets knowledge of one’s karmic activity—hence it is called *without self-knowledge*.\n\nAll foods congeal qi. When unified qi coagulates, it harmonizes with supreme harmony; when harmony and unity are complete, then wisdom’s illumination remains ever profound. Now, the mouth takes in flavors to fill the five viscera, the body gathers froth and foam to bear its form, receiving its bodily substance from earth, congealing moisture from water, inheriting heat from fire, relying on breath from wind—these four conditions bind and leak, none being wondrous essence. Thus, the single qi is stained and muddied, supreme harmony is disturbed, and when thoughts and sensations arise, the defilements of movement are born.\n\nNot the long-settled congealment. One should allow supreme harmony to contain unity without thoughts or sensations, guarding the true and constant profundity, then merging with supreme harmony in substance. Now, through the congealment of qi by various foods, it is not the long-settled congealment.\n\nQi returns to the root qi. The four conditions receive perception, the six defilements generate corruption—earth, water, fire, and wind scatter and return to their root. When the root perception is defiled, it follows the karma it has received.\n\nWhat is taken must be discharged accordingly. *Taking* is reception; *discharging* is activation. Thoughts have two kinds of reception, karma has two kinds of response—according to what is received, its signs are activated. If supreme harmony harmonizes with unity, then unified qi is wholly harmonized, leading to that emptiness of the ultimate—this is called *returning to the mandate*. In returning to the mandate, constancy is attained—this is called *right reception*. Right reception produces pure karma, which gives rise to wisdom’s illumination. When wisdom’s illumination is profoundly constant, utterly without anything, then one enters the unquestionable.\n\nThe one: when qi from food returns to the four conditions, karma is complete and one sinks into the six destinies. The *Laozi’s Commentary on the Scripture of the Five Kitchens* concludes here.",
      "overlap_context": "ccord with departure. If one cultivates nature to depart from intention, then within and without are both still, with no arising or abiding mind, no sitting or acting—each thought arises and each thought ceases. If one accumulates cultivation without forgetting and extinguishing, arousing a single thought of cultivation that draws forth a thousand jun, inner illumination is shaken, and external dust arises—this does not accord with departure from intention.\n\nIntend without cultivating intention.",
