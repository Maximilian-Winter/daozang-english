Later separated into an independent volume.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Tai Xuan* Section.\n\n---\n\n### **The Supreme Yang Master’s Essential Diagrams of the Golden Elixir**\n\n**Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate**\nBefore yin and yang divided, its form resembled a hen’s egg.\n\n**Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate’s Division**\n\"That which is called the Dao/Way consists of one yin and one yang.\"\nDark and turbid is yin; white and pure is yang.\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate is the origin of yin and yang.\nHeaven and Earth are the forms of yin and yang.\n\n**Diagram of the Prior-Heaven Supreme Ultimate**\nYin gives rise to yang as the Supreme Ultimate; inverting its function produces the Elixir.\n\n**Diagram of the Post-Heaven Supreme Ultimate**\nYang gives rise to yin as the Supreme Ultimate; when the Five Phases flow in sequence, completion is achieved.\n\n**Diagram of the Ninefold Return of the Golden Elixir**\nYin and yang unite; water and fire achieve mutual fulfillment.\n\n**Diagram of the Sevenfold Reversion of the Golden Elixir**\nWithin blackness lies whiteness; the body transforms into pure *qian*.\n\n**Diagram of the Five Phases in the Golden Elixir**\nHeaven One generates Water—within Water, the true yang *qi* is Black Lead.\nLead is the ancestor of the Five Metals, and Metal rightfully resides in the West.\nIt is not called \"Metal\" but \"Silver,\" for it resembles the white color of *dui*.\n\nMetal inherently generates Water, yet the cultivator of the Elixir extracts Metal from *kan* because the mother conceals the child within the womb.\n\nEarth Two generates Fire—within Fire, the true yin essence is Black Mercury.\nMercury is the father of cinnabar, and Mercury rightfully resides in the East.\nIt is not called \"Wood\" but \"Mercury,\" for it is the Wood-fluid of the *zhen* palace.\n\nWood inherently generates Fire, yet the cultivator of the Elixir seeks the Wood-fluid within *li* because it is where the bowstring’s *qi* resides.\n\n**Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate’s Sequential and Inverse Cycles**\nSequential...\n\n**Diagram of the Primordial Qi’s Embodied Forms**\n**Diagram of the Three-Five-One of the Golden Elixir**\n\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"Three, five, one—just these three words,\nYet rare indeed are those who truly comprehend.\nEast three and south two together make five,\nNorth one and west four complete the sum.\nWu and ji reside in the generative number five,\nThe three families meet to form the infant.\nThe infant is the One containing true qi,\nAfter ten months the womb is full—enter the sacred foundation.\"*\n\nMaster Shangyang says:\n*\"The One is the ancestral qi of Heaven and Earth.\nTo understand the Three-Five-One is to know the origin of true Lead.\"*\n\n**Diagram of Purity and Turbidity, Movement and Stillness**\n**The Original Substance of Qian and Kun**\n**Li and Kan as Function**\n\nThe Great Dao generates the One qi,\nWithin qi, yin and yang divide.\nYin is turbid, yang is pure;\nThe female is black, the male is white.\n\nThe Most High says:\n*\"Know the white, guard the black;\nKnow the male, guard the female.\"*\n\nThus the scripture states:\n*\"Purity is the source of turbidity,\nMovement the foundation of stillness.\nIf one can abide in constant purity and stillness,\nHeaven and Earth all return to them.\"*\n\nMaster Niwan says:\n*\"In my former practice, after a year’s work,\nThe six pulses stilled and qi returned to the root.\nNow my whole body is white blood,\nAnd I feel no cold or heat through the four seasons.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"Black and white support each other as Water and Metal.\"*\n\nMaster Shangyang says:\n*\"Qian and Kun are the body,\nYet it is the white within Kan that returns to Li.\nThus it is called the Golden Elixir.\"*\n\n**Diagram of the Precious Pearl**\n\nA single precious pearl,\nFirst born within the oyster’s womb,\nNurtured beneath the black dragon’s chin.\n\nThe World-Honored One obtained it,\nCalling it *maṇi*.\nThe Heavenly Worthy obtained it,\nCalling it a grain of millet.\n\nThe great practitioner must know the truth of this pearl—\nIt is the single point of Kan-Li’s interpenetration,\nIn virtue harmonizing with Heaven and Earth,\nIn luminosity uniting with sun and moon.\n\nCalled the *maṇi* pearl—\nOffered by the dragon maiden.\nCalled the Pearl of Yuanshi—\nTaken from the sea oyster.\nCalled the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl—\nPaired with the alchemical maiden.\nCalled the Fire Pearl—\nThe treasure of the black dragon’s chin.\n\nThough worldly pearls may span an inch,\nThey are but playthings with a price.\nThis pearl, though most subtle,\nCannot be played with, cannot be seen—\nYet it is the priceless treasure.\n\n**Diagram of the Four Images of the Golden Elixir**\n\nThe sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,\nLi and Kan the function of yin and yang.\nQian and Kun serve as the crucible—\nTo gather the essence of sun and moon.\nYin and yang serve as furnace and charcoal—\nTo conjoin the qi of Kan and Li.\n\nThe Elixir method inverts to form *Earth-Heaven Peace*,\nThe Elixir path reverses to achieve *Water-Fire Interpenetration*.\n\nThe scripture says:\n*\"The sun dwelling in Li’s position becomes the woman,\nKan paired with the Toad Palace becomes the man.\nWithout a teacher’s guidance, this truth is hard to know.\"*\n\n**Diagram of the Eight Trigrams of the Golden Elixir**\n**Exposition on the Eight Trigrams of the Golden Elixir**\n\nThe trigram is the image.\nWhere there is a body, there must be function;\nWhere there is change, there must be union.\n\nIf Gen is taken as the body, then Kun is its function;\nIf Zhen is taken as the body, then Dui is its function.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"In the southwest, one finds companions,\nAnd walks with one’s kind.\"*\nThis is like Li taking Kan as its kind.\n\nFor the cultivation of the Golden Elixir,\nOne takes Metal from Dui,\nYet Dui is the White Tiger,\nWhose heart is set on devouring,\nCausing no small harm to people and things.\nIf one can master the Green Dragon of Zhen Palace,\nThen one can naturally subdue the Tiger.\n\nThe Golden Elixir—\nTo subdue the White Tiger alone is the task;\nAll else is easy.\n\nNow, Dui is born of Kun and acts in Kun’s stead,\nQian Metal generates Dui,\nYet when its simplicity scatters,\nQian lodges its Metal in Kan,\nCalling it Black Lead.\nTo take Dui’s Metal from Kan—\nThe mother conceals the child within the womb.\n\nThe Buddhist scripture speaks of\n*\"One mouthful swallowing the waters of the Western River\"*—\nThis is the meaning.\n\n**Diagram of the Mutual Resonance of Forms and Things**\n**Exposition on the Mutual Resonance of Forms and Things**\n\nLord Laozi said:\nInwardly observe the heart—yet the heart is not the heart;\nOutwardly observe the form—yet the form is not the form;\nFrom afar observe the thing—yet the thing is not the thing.\nWhen these three are awakened,\nOnly emptiness is seen.\n\nThe Buddhist scripture says:\n*\"Within heaven and earth, amid the cosmos,\nThere is a treasure concealed in the mountain of form.\"*\n\nIt also says:\n*\"I possess one thing,\nAbove it props up the sky, below it props up the earth—\nDo any of you recognize it?\"*\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states:\n*\"That which is above form is called the Dao.\"*\n\nIt further states:\n*\"When male and female unite their essence,\nThe myriad things transform and come to life.\"*\n\nThe three teachings of cultivation\nNever depart from form and thing.\nThus Elder Danyang said:\n*\"Quickly press me down into the mountain,\nHastily break open the cave of Dragon and Tiger.\"*\n\nElder Boyang said:\n*\"Ears, eyes, mouth—the three treasures,\nSeal them tightly, let nothing pass.\nThe true person hides in the deep abyss,\nFloating and wandering, guarding the compass within.\"*\n\nWhen one awakens to this,\nOnly then does one know that the forms of Dragon and Tiger,\nThe things of Tortoise and Snake,\nAll arise from within the human body.\nWithout these two,\nThe sacred embryo cannot be joined.\nThis wondrous truth must not be neglected.\n\n**Illustrations of the Bright Mirror Daoist Alchemy**\n\n**Suspended Embryo Crucible**\nThe crucible measures one foot and five inches in circumference, with a hollow center of five inches, and is one foot and two inches in length. It is divided into three layers, corresponding to the Three Powers. The body and belly of the crucible are straight and uniform, with equal proportions in the upper, middle, and lower sections. Eight inches are placed into the furnace, suspended within the hearth without touching the ground—hence the name \"Suspended Embryo.\" It is also called the Cinnabar Crucible.\n\nZhang Sui’s annotation states: It is also named the *Taiyi Divine Furnace*.\n\n**To the Tune of \"Courtyard Full of Fragrance\"**\nA true iron ox,\nUgly in form, stubborn in nature,\nEver fond of racing.\nEveryone possesses one,\nYet who knows how to ride it?\nPlanting the golden sprout fills the courtyard,\nBut it must be watered with divine liquid.\nWithin the Central Palace,\nWithout this beast,\nHow could the infant be born?\n\nHeaven and Earth,\nIn true motion and stillness,\nAll life and sustenance depend on it.\nWhen hungry, it feeds on tiger marrow;\nWhen thirsty, it drinks from the mercury pool.\nAt midnight, it pulls the chariot to stoke the fire,\nBursting with radiance,\nIlluminating the depths of the sea.\nThe shepherd boy laughs,\nAfter feasting in the Flowery Pond,\nRiding home beneath the moon’s glow.\n\n**Crescent Moon Furnace**\nThe furnace’s surface measures approximately one foot and two inches in circumference. The \"bright heart\" spans one foot horizontally, with a two-inch rim encircling it, and the rim is two inches thick. The furnace’s mouth opens like an inverted cauldron or an upturned crescent moon—hence the name *Crescent Moon Furnace*.\n\nZhang Sui’s annotation: It is also called the *Majestic Radiance Crucible*.\n\n**Names for Mercury and Lead**\n\n**Mercury (汞):**\nGuest, Wife, Minister, Quicksilver, Flowing Pearl, Jade Liquid, Divine Water, Enchanting Maiden, Mysterious Maiden, Wood Liquid, White Snow, Blue-Eyed Barbarian Boy, Green-Clad Maiden, Azure Dragon of the Eastern Sea, Intertwined Pear, Floating.\n\n**Lead (铅):**\nYin Fire, White, Guest, Subject, Celestial Soul, Elixir Foundation, Black Tortoise Essence, True Yin within Yang, Half-Catty of Lower Crescent Silver.\n\nThe above are alternate names for mercury.\n\n**Golden Elixir, Fire Elixir, Internal Elixir, Reverted Elixir, Divine Elixir, True Lead, Great Medicine, Infant, Valley Spirit, Sacred Embryo, Knife-Tip, Sevenfold Return, Jade Flask Elixir, Purple Gold Elixir, Crimson Snow Elixir, Red Glowing Golden Elixir, Dragon-Tiger Great Medicine, Golden Liquid Reverted Elixir, Jade Liquid Reverted Elixir, Ninefold Cyclic Elixir, Purple Gold Frost, True Yellow Sprout, True Yin-Yang, True Mysterious Female, True Father-Mother, True Dragon-Tiger, True Seed, True Master, True Lead-Mercury, True Unity, Lord of the Cosmos, Autumn Stone, River Chariot, Metal Duke, Metal Consort, Field Elixir, Golden Crucible Lord, Yellow Lad, Three-Five-One, Beautiful Gold Flower, Pearl of Māṇi, White Horse Tooth, Gold in Water, Jade-Stamen Gold Sand, Divine Talisman White Snow, Tortoise Essence Phoenix Marrow, Hare Marrow Bird Liver, Solar Essence, Lunar Spirit, Sun and Moon within the Flask, Primordial Essence before Heaven and Earth, *Taiyi* Containing True *Qi*.\n\n**Lead (铅):**\nMerchant, Husband, Lord, Golden Liquid, Golden Flower, Jade Pond, Flowery Pond, Infant.\n\n(The above are alternate names for the Golden Elixir.)\n\n**Yellow Lad, Metal Essence, Yellow Sprout, White-Headed Elder, Plain-Silk Gentleman, White Tiger of the Western Mountains, Fire Jujube, Sinking.**\n\n**Yellow Tooth Lead, Master, Father-Mother, Earthly Spirit, Elixir Mother, Red Phoenix Marrow, True Yang within Yin, Eight Ounces of Upper Crescent Gold.**\n\nThe above are alternate names for lead.\n\n**Purple Clarity Golden Elixir Fire Timing Formula**\nGather the transformations of Heaven and Earth,\nKnead the sun and moon into refined ashes.\nThe Metal Duke falls silent, the Enchanting Maiden dies,\nYet the Yellow Dame, though ageless, still nurtures the embryo.\n\n**True Fire Has No Timing**\nIn the lead furnace, slowly nurture the true golden liquid.\n\nWithin the earthen crucible, first dry the living mercury;\nThe Great Medicine knows no measure—pound or mercury—\nYet the heart refines the Crimson Dragon’s nature,\nThe leaden body congeals qi into the White Tiger’s life.\n\nWithin and without, not a trace of yin remains,\nAmidst the radiance of ten thousand forms, the Jade Clarity realm.\n\n**Eighteen Secrets of the Alchemical Method, Aligned with the Three and Five**\n1. **Gathering the Medicine** – Collect body and mind, gather spirit and qi.\n7. **Bathing** – Wash the heart, cleanse the thoughts.\n13. **The Work** – Evening gathering, morning collection; tempering through time, refining through the sun.\n\n2. **Coagulating the Elixir** – Qi congeals, thoughts still.\n8. **Cinnabar** – Being and non-being intermingle, concealment and manifestation align.\n14. **Union** – Thoughts flow unbroken, merging into one.\n\n3. **Refinement** – Golden liquid refines the form, jade talismans guard the spirit.\n9. **Passing the Gates** – Fruit grows on branches, the child rests in the womb.\n15. **Great Return** – Facing phenomena without intent, day and night as one.\n\n4. **Sealing and Nurturing** – Cut off thoughts, forget the form.\n10. **Perfecting the Embryo** – The rooster and dragon brood the egg, the cicada takes shape.\n16. **Sacred Embryo** – The spirit hibernates, the qi is stored.\n\n5. **Martial Fire** – Vigilant stoking, unyielding flame.\n\n**Vigorously rousing the spirit to dispel stray thoughts.**\n11. **Gentle Nurturing** – Knowing the white, guarding the black, the numinous comes of itself.\n17. **Nine Revolutions** – When the fire-timing is full, the infant appears.\n\n**6.
