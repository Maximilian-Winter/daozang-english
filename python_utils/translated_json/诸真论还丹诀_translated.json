the moon belongs to yin, symbolizing the lower elixir field,\nThe sun belongs to yang, symbolizing the middle elixir field.\nHow do the two halves ascend and merge into one?\n\nThe azure qi, primordial qi, and fluids,\nThe three combine into one, forming the pearl.\nEmerging from that jade pool to enter the golden chamber—\nThe jade pool is the mouth, the golden chamber the womb.\nFluids and qi, both within the qi sea,\nCoalesce into a pearl, like an orange, golden in hue.\n\nLarge as a pellet, yellow as an orange—\nThe womb forms due to qi, the qi forms the pearl due to the womb.\nWithin it lies a fine flavor, sweet as honey—\nOnce the womb-qi forms the pearl like an orange,\nWithin the qi sea, each time one ingests qi,\nVisualizing the qi enveloping the pearl,\nOne sees it, and the mouth’s jade pool naturally becomes sweet as honey.\n\nGuard it well once obtained, never lose it—\nOnce the womb forms the pearl, beware of speaking of it to the uninitiated.\nIf one engages in intercourse with women, this mysterious pearl shatters,\nNever to form again!\n\nIf one carefully cultivates it, the immortal Dao is complete—\nEssence and qi unite, called the inner reverted elixir.\nThe fluids ascend and descend, irrigating the cinnabar field above the head,\nWhere the nine palaces reside—this is the nine-fold refined eight-jade elixir.\nAfter nine years of cultivating qi, the work is complete, and the great Dao is achieved,\nEqual to heaven and earth.\n\nEssence becomes jade, qi becomes gold,\nThe primordial belongs to the mysterious pearl.\nEnvelop the mysterious pearl in white qi and enter the golden chamber—\nThe golden chamber is the lung, the womb,\nThe qi sea stores the three—the heart.\nThe great number is three.\n\n---\n\n**Cao Shengtu’s Song of Lead and Mercury**\n\nGold has a single body,\nIts movement follows south and north.\nThough a few know its tune,\nAll dwell beside Penglai’s shore.\n\nIn the vast sea, none encounter it,\nAnd those who do fail to recognize it.\nThe sun, moon, and five stars,\nAll become wandering clouds.\n\nIf a humble man seeks longevity,\nHe will surpass the three sighs.\nHis aspiration lies in transmitting a single qi,\nTransforming it into golden liquid.\n\nGolden liquid connects to the immortals—\nOne must seek it within the five phases.\nThe five phases exist everywhere,\nYet the immortals do not hoard them.\n\nTo recognize true lead and mercury,\nOne water returns to one stone.\nThe central palace first serves as the master,\nWater and fire unite to form the substance.\n\nThe two poles become husband and wife,\nHusband and wife pair as counterparts.\nFor a hundred moments, reach the Li palace—\nCinnabar emerges from this.\n\nIt resembles a true pearl,\nCinnabar is not inherently red.\nWhen it meets water, it returns to water’s nature;\nWhen it meets fire, it becomes golden liquid.\n\nThe Great Sages each possess numinous medicines,\nThe Perfected call them \"Precious Guardians.\"\nYet when the world’s scholars are asked,\nThey speak only of metals and minerals—\nMetals and minerals are stubborn things,\nHow could they transform into golden liquid?\n\nShed the fetal husk, cast off the dark halo,\nFor the dark halo is but lead’s essence.\nPrimal qi replenishes primal qi—\nHow could vulgar cinnabar or stone suffice?\n\nRealgar need not be dearly bought,\nCinnabar need not be sought,\nMercury vainly boasts of itself—\nYet who has ever truly attained it?\n\nWhen bamboo splits, mend it with bamboo;\nWhen wood breaks, graft it with wood.\nFor humans, beyond replenishing qi,\nAll other things are but guests.\n\nIf one can fathom water and fire,\nTheir name will surely enter the immortals’ register.\nLead and mercury bear many names,\nYet their root lies in the five phases.\nShould one master the art of refinement,\nIngesting the elixir grants longevity.\n\nThus concludes the discourse of the Perfected on the secrets of Returning Cinnabar.",
