  "full_translation": "**Preface to *\n\nHui Chunzi said: A single mani pearl outweighs the sands of the world; the dragon maiden offers it, and only now do we recognize its worth. Hmph! One child with two mothers, four gates of kinship—none may be neglected.\n\nKnow that while the outer is turbid, the inner remains fundamentally pure. Dragon’s head and tiger’s tail arise in due season. Should you merge the mundane and sacred as one, white snow and yellow sprouts will grow of themselves.\n\nHui Chunzi said: What is the Dao? To void the bladder and bowels, to eat and dress—yet all remains unclear.\n\nThe Great Dao first requires nurturing the numinous spirit; once the radiant light is awakened, returning to the root is easy. Even if essence, qi, and spirit are all full, how can one refine and temper in darkness?\n\nHui Chunzi said: East, south, west, north, and the central lands—how swiftly the dust of the world turns hair white. Bah! The speaker has it backward.\n\nIs it difficult or not? A single somersault. Is it easy or not? Force open both eyes. Seal the mouth, concentrate the spirit, and gaze inward; the Dharma-body ever manifests at the tip of a hair. Gather the luminous treasure of clarity in stillness, and dwell directly in the central palace—there lies the elixir.\n\nHui Chunzi said: Once grasped, seal the mouth. If you still refuse to take up the task, what use is the bamboo rod to drive you away? Hmph, hmph, hmph! Come again, and you’ll not be worth half a coin—go rest in the abbot’s quarters.\n\nThe vast sky, clear and returning, is originally unstained; clouds come and go, each lost in its own busyness. Stirring the wind of Xun, it spirals above and below; the luminous treasure of inherent nature is wholly gathered into the sack.\n\nHui Chunzi said: A single cloth sack, boundless in its embrace, murky and undifferentiated—nothing escapes it.\n\nDo not divide the world’s affairs into light and dark; in leisure, seek the self that preceded you. Remain wakeful, free from the attitudes of heat and cold; cast off life and death entirely to attain the utmost truth.\n\nHui Chunzi said: Above the nine heavens, below the nine springs, Shaolin’s staff and fist strike high and low. Strike through, and the horse may gallop freely.\n\nFierce flames dance with the Azure Dragon; boundless clear waves crouch with the White Tiger. Tie the tiger’s tail and dragon’s head with a silken cord, and capture them to return to the spirit-chamber, uniting with the true source.\n\nHui Chunzi said: Long parted from home, the Way is long and obstructed; now that you have returned, you find father, mother, wife, and children all well. Hmph! The thousand-year-old marble pillar remains unchanged, though mulberry fields may turn to sea.\n\nThe *Yi* states: “Supreme indeed is the primal power of Kun, from which all things draw their life.” What is called “following and supporting Qian”—is this not so? Yet among women of the world, few truly understand the Way of Kun and embody its virtue. Some are dull and stubborn in habit, others indulge in extravagance and violence, becoming commonplace; the varieties of delusion are too many to enumerate. Even among the one or two with resolve who seek to escape birth and death, their nature and life remain obscure. They often turn to shamans and old women, learning a few empty phrases about past causes and future effects, believing this to be the Great Dao. Blindly cultivating and recklessly refining, they mislead both themselves and others!\n\nAlas, this is all due to the loss of the true oral instructions for women’s cultivation of Kun. Now the *Xichi Collection* emerges, revealing secrets untransmitted for a thousand ages. With great compassion, it opens the gate of expedient means. May all women under heaven respectfully believe in and practice it, delving deeply and exhaustively. Every word holds merit, every sentence contains a secret—do not lightly let them slip by. Where brush and ink cannot convey, wholehearted devotion to the Dao will naturally lead to encountering a true person’s guidance.\n\nThe fundamental first step is to collect the mind and nurture qi. If the mind is not collected, the root of inherent nature is obscured. If qi is not nurtured, the stem of life is lost. Cultivating both nature and life, the Way of Kun is made complete.\n\nReaders of this collection, take care not to squander this opportunity, lest you betray the author’s compassionate intent to ferry the world.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Lingyangzi.",
