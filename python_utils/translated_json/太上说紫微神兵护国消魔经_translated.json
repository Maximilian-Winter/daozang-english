  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Venerable Sovereign’s Scripture on the Purple Tenuity Divine Soldiers for Protecting the State and Dispelling Demons**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Venerable Sovereign’s Scripture on the Purple Tenuity Divine Soldiers for Protecting the State and Dispelling Demons*. Author unknown. Two scriptures bound in one volume. Source text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Venerable Sovereign’s Scripture on the Purple Tenuity Divine Soldiers for Protecting the State and Dispelling Demons**\n\nAt that time, during the second year of the *Shanghuang* reign, on the eighth day of the *Jianchen* month, the Supreme Venerable Sovereign Lord Lao expounded in the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace to the Great Brahmā Heavenly Emperor, the Four Poles’ Lofty Perfected, the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Beings, and the Three Heavens’ True Sovereigns the *Purple Tenuity Divine Incantation, Numinous Treasure, and the Great Spontaneous Divine Soldiers for Protecting the State and Dispelling Demons*.\n\nIt was the *Kaihuang* year of *Jiashen*, when the reckoning reached one hundred and six. Heaven and Earth did not seal, and baleful *qi* flowed unchecked. The five grains did not flourish, and people schemed to harm one another. Warfare arose on all sides, and the people of the state knew no peace. Those who accumulated goodness and virtue, the practitioners of the Dao who transcended great calamities, were ranked among the immortals. The common folk, untaught and heedless of their past lives, did not follow the scriptures and laws. Right and wrong were confused, the Four Visions obscured, the Six Passions defiled, and their hearts lacked self-respect. When committing evil, they feared nothing. This was the karmic retribution of sentient beings, and thus it came to pass.\n\nAt that time, the demonic ghosts of the Six Caves of Fengdu emerged by night and hid by day, transforming into hideous shapes. Each demon led its retinue, spreading the five kinds of pestilence. Those afflicted fell into stupors and died; demonic *qi* assailed people, turning into rashes and sores. The governors, officials, civil and military officers, and the myriad commoners—those who guarded the mountains and pressed the wilds—fled in terror. Men wailed, women wept, their sorrow and suffering moved Heaven above. The Heavenly Worthy, beholding this, took pity on the multitudes enduring such torments.\n\nThereupon, he stirred the *Xu* and *Wei* constellations, entrusting their essence to respond to the crisis. Taking the True as father, the Primordial as mother, and the Beginning as surname, the Three *Qi* descended upon the Palace of Vast Spirit, coalescing into a great mass, its form like chaos. From above, nine rays of light shone forth, their brilliance outshining the sun, their rosy hues resplendent, their radiance illuminating the Supreme Tenuity. Ever were Jade Maidens and Golden Lads, giant rainbows and lions, and the Four Upright Talismanic Clerks guarding the sacred embryo.\n\nOn the seventh day of the *Jianshen* month, the embryo split open of its own accord. Like a great thunderclap, the purple womb fell away, revealing a jade-like form, its body towering five hundred *zhang*. It was the Perfected Warrior of the True Clouds, his hair unbound, clad in a black robe, wielding a sword and shod in boots. Divine soldiers, talismanic clerks, the Duke of Thunder, the Mother of Lightning, and the Four Upright Envoys bore his retinue.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Perfected Warrior to descend upon Mount Fengdu and subdue the demonic ghosts. The Perfected Warrior, obeying the Heavenly Worthy’s decree, ordered the Heavenly Marshal of Slaying Ghosts of Northern Fengdu, along with the Vice General of the Celestial Plan, to lead the Divine Soldiers of the Divine Empyrean, the Merit Officers of the Nine *Qi*, the Jade Maidens of the Three Heavens, the Divine Lords of the Seven *Qi*, the True Governors of the Five Numinous Spirits, the Great Yellow-Armored Gods, the Heavenly Soldiers, talismanic clerks, and hundreds of thousands of troops. They waged great battle against the demonic ghosts of the Six Caves in the dark wilds of the cavernous yin.\n\nThen, the Demon Lord, wielding the *qi* of *Kan* and *Li*, transformed into a colossal black turtle and a giant serpent, seeking to unleash his illusions. The Perfected Warrior, with his divine power, crushed and subdued them, placing them beneath his feet. He then dispatched the Great God of the Golden Bell and Flaming Fire, who recited the *Chapter for Subduing Demons*. Breath exhaled from his mouth transformed into a great wheel of fire, which burned the demonic hordes. Their hair and flesh scorched, their demonic powers rendered useless, they repented and turned their hearts, vowing to submit to the Supreme Truth.\n\nThereupon, the Perfected Warrior sent the Heavenly Soldiers and talismanic clerks to bind the demonic hordes and deliver them to the Great Cavern of Fengdu. The Heavenly Worthy declared: \"When yin reaches its extreme, it heralds the coming of yang’s reckoning. Sometimes, yellow stars gather their radiance, red talismans manifest auspicious signs. Purple *qi* ascends to the courtyard, the Five Stars cluster in the Well. A flowing rainbow pierces the moon, great lightning flashes beyond the pivot. Then, the numinous descends from the sacred peaks, stars conceive their aides, and the celestial reckoning is fulfilled—thus is the world established. The sagely ruler appears, wise ministers assist. Treachery and villainy hide away, the five weapons are sheathed. The nine grains flourish, filial piety and kindness arise daily, and the people delight in their livelihoods.\"\n\nThe Perfected Lord rendered great service to the world, eradicating harm for the people, his virtue moving the heavens above. The Heavenly Worthy dispatched the Golden Flower Jade Lad and the Embroidered Robe Envoy, bearing the Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandate, to proclaim: \"For your merit in beheading poison and vanquishing evil, you are enfeoffed as the Great General of the Mysterious Heaven, Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Pole.\"\n\nThereupon, the Great Sage mounted a blue-green dragon and paid homage to the Three Pure Ones. At that time, the Perfected Immortals of the lower realms and the assembly of sacred multitudes gazed upward along the cloud paths, beholding the divine radiance, their eyes following the rosy whirlwinds as they bowed and took leave of the True Emperor. In an instant, purple clouds descended from the heavens, and light mists rose from the earth. Clouds and mist intertwined; only the celestial music could be heard, gradually receding into the distance. The great assembly returned each to their own realm.\n\nAll followed the golden words, propagating the Dao and its transformations, circulating the precious scripture. Beneath the Four Heavens, all received the Perfected One’s protection, their blessings and virtue boundless, to be upheld forever.\n\n**Thus concludes *The Supreme Venerable Sovereign’s Scripture on the Purple Tenuity Divine Soldiers for Protecting the State and Dispelling Demons*.**",
