The seven ancestors shall be burdened with the stones of Mount Meng, filling the River of Eternal Night.

They must not tread in defilement or impurity, lest they offend the true and disrupt the qi.

The celestial perfected hold these secrets in the utmost reverence—how could one not be cautious?\n\nOn the days of the eight solar terms and one’s own life-destiny day, the bearer of the talisman shall bathe, enter the chamber, and at midnight, face north with a single-minded heart, bow in darkness, and visualize the Threefold Purity’s clouds descending from the northwest, filling the chamber inside and out. After a long while, cover the ears and mouth with both hands, draw in the cloud-qi thirty times, and swallow it. Upon completion, one shall perceive the cloud-qi dispersing, revealing two small children resembling infants, each holding a brocade pouch. One pouch contains the esoteric script of the *Eight Radiant Jade Registers*, and the other, the *Scripture of the Three Treasures*. They shall bestow these upon the practitioner’s body, whereupon the two children shall transform into two august emperors and enter the practitioner’s form.\n\nThen recite the incantation:\n*\"Emerging from the Mystic, entering the Pure,\nReturning to the radiant chamber of the dawn,\nTeach me, instruct me,\nO Unbounded White Prime,\nThe Feminine Unity nurtures,\nThe Five Registers penetrate the Mystic,\nThirty-nine chapters,\nTen thousand traversals of womb-born life,\nPreserve the hun-soul, summon the spirit,\nUnveil the gates of the Cavernous Perfection.\nThe jade talisman is complete,\nThe body ascends upon purple clouds,\nTo pay homage to the Northern Emperor,\nAnd worship in the Jade Purity Palace.\"*\n\nUpon completion, knock the teeth nine times and swallow saliva thirty times. After eight years of such practice, the jade chariot of the Eight Heavenly Radiant Scenes of the cloudy green canopy shall arrive to receive the practitioner’s body, ascending to the Jade Purity Palace.\n\nIn cultivation, one must not slacken, but devote the heart to the Mystic.

It facilitates communion with the true and ensures that recitation is free from inauspicious dissonance. Upon wearing the talisman and reciting the scripture ten thousand times, the Three Primes shall dispatch the chariot of the Eight Radiant Scenes to welcome the practitioner’s body, ascending to the Jade Purity Palace.\n\nThe *Esoteric Morning Diagrams* emerged from the Palace of the Eight Primordial Void-Born Ones, congealed from qi into scripture. The Supreme Lord of the Purple Dao of the Cavernous Void of Jade Purity bestowed them upon the Most Exalted Lord of the Great Dao, who bore them in the boundless palace of the Eight Heavens.
