  "full_translation": "**Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Western Ascension**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Western Ascension*. Compiled by the Northern Song Daoist Bixuzi (Chen Jingyuan). Six fascicles. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category. Collated with: The Imperial Annotated Edition by Emperor Huizong of the Song (Zhenghe Era).\n\n**Preface to the Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Western Ascension**\n\nWhen the world’s Dao was in mutual decline and the purest of comforts grew scarce, the sage, though not dwelling in the mountains and forests, concealed his virtue. As the Zhou declined, Laozi did not hide his person to remain unseen, nor seal his words to prevent their emergence, nor conceal his wisdom to withhold its revelation—it was the great perversity of the times. Thereafter, weary of the world and resigning from office, he sought to return to the primordial and advance beyond. Moreover, when heaven and earth close, the worthy withdraw—this has been so for ages.\n\nAt that time, Guan Yin, observing the qi, knew that a profoundly realized person was traveling west. He then purified himself, blocked the road, and invited him to his dwelling, where he inquired in secret. Thereupon, Laozi expounded upon matters in some detail. His subtle words and profound meanings transcended the questions of the *Five Thousand Characters*, and these were recorded into a book titled *Record of the Western Ascension*.\n\nThe Dao is self-so. Those who practice it may attain it; those who hear it may speak of it. Yet those who attain it—how could they fathom it? Those who speak of it—how could they comprehend it? Thus, he concealed himself within himself and did not emerge; he concealed others within others and did not appear.\n\nAs for the empty, primal, and indistinct—these are the roots of the things that exist. The ten thousand things share a common origin—this is the source of the things that exist. Those who know it depart from it; those who desire it separate from it; those who approach it distance themselves from it. Only those who attain it hold it within themselves without forgetting. Thus, he concealed his wild words and remained silent. Therefore, what is transmitted today—is it not like the straw dogs of old? What is savored today—is it not the dregs of antiquity?\n\nYet in cultivating the Dao, one daily diminishes—is this not forgetting action? In pursuing learning, one daily increases—is this not prizing words? Thus, attaining the One, the ten thousand affairs are complete. With no mind to retain virtue, even ghosts and spirits submit. Know that the One and words become two; two and the One become three. Beyond this, subtle practices and profound words proliferate without end. Hence, Zhuangzi often praised those whose words remained within this principle.\n\nBixuzi, hearing of this tradition with delight, searched the hidden archives and found nearly five commentators. First, he collated and selected the correct interpretations of the scripture; later, he excised the erroneous annotations. Compiling them into two sections, he now presents them in six fascicles, retaining the original title *Laozi’s Scripture of Western Ascension*. This is offered to fellow students, that they may clearly perceive the great essence of the ancients—not merely to entangle themselves in affirming or denying, obscuring their spirit in shallowness, and forgetting the vast emptiness of the Great Clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Western Ascension, Fascicle One**\n\nCommentators:\nHua Yang Wei Chuxuan\nJu Qu Xu Daomiao\nChongxuanzi\nRenzizi Li Rong\nAnnotations by Liu Renhui\nCompiled by Bixuzi\n\n**Chapter One: Western Ascension**\n\n*Laozi ascends west.*\n\n**Chongxuanzi’s note:** The opening marks Lord Yin’s recording of events, clarifying the intent of Lord Lao’s transformative journey.\n\n*Opening the Dao of Jambudvīpa.*\n*Styled \"Ancient Master,\" skilled in entering the primordial.*\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** \"Ascends west\" refers to departing from the ancestral lineage of Zhou. \"Opening the Dao\" means that when Lord Lao departed Zhou and journeyed to the western extremity, he would open the Dao in those lands—hence \"opening and guiding.\" \"Jambudvīpa\" is the name of a country in the western extremity. \"Styled Ancient Master\" signifies the Great Dao of the primordial origin, born before heaven, thus called \"Ancient Master,\" an alternate name for Lord Lao. The sagely virtue broadly extends, unbound by any place; wisdom and ability illuminate the realm, though bright, it is ever dim to the common eye. The essence can activate its function, though in motion, it remains ever still. Thus, it wondrously aligns with the principle of names, skillfully enters into independence, and congeals in the primordial act. This is what is meant by: \"The Dao constantly acts without acting, and all things exist within it, yet in things it is absent.\" It neither ends nor begins, eternally abiding in continuity.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** Where there is life, there is a beginning; where there is death, there is an end. The Dao, being without death or life, is thus said to neither end nor begin. Truly constant and unmoving, it has existed since ancient times. Therefore, ascending to follow the Dao, he passed through the pass. The Pass Keeper Yin Xi perceived the qi.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** From this spring realm, he journeyed to that autumn land, expounding the Dao of the Ancient Master and perfecting the ever-abiding virtue. The path he trod led through the Hangu Pass.\n\n**Chongxuanzi’s note:** The pass is the ancient Peach Forest. \"The Pass Keeper Yin Xi perceived the qi\" is recorded at the beginning of this scripture to clarify the circumstances of their encounter. At that time, Master Yin built a thatched hut at the foot of Mount Zhongnan, observing the stars and gazing at the qi. He saw the celestial principle moving eastward, purple clouds advancing west, and the qi above the pass taking the form of dragons and serpents, extending into the Milky Way. For a month, a warm breeze arrived thrice. Knowing this to be the sign of a sage crossing the pass, he sought to become its keeper to await him—hence \"perceived the qi.\"\n\n**Xu’s note:** Through accumulated resonance with the mysterious, purple and black vapors first arose. Through fasting and vigilant waiting, he indeed encountered the sagely guest.\n\nHe expounded the *Dao and Virtue*, arranging them into two fascicles.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** Perceiving the opportunity, he requested the secret treasure of eternal abiding, responding with emptiness to the wondrous subtleties of the mysterious origin, desiring that all beings return to principle and all true persons attain the Dao. \"Arranged\" means divided; \"fascicles\" refers to the written compilation, split into two scrolls.\n\nHe taught the essentials of the Dao to Master Yin.\n\n**Chongxuanzi’s note:** \"Taught\" marks the beginning of Lord Lao’s discourse. \"Master Yin\" refers to Yin Xi. He would teach the essentials of cultivating the perfect Dao and the causes of ascending to truth and transcending the world. \"Essentials\" is the general term for the most wondrous.\n\nThe Dao is self-so.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** \"Self-so\" means inwardly without self-nature, outwardly without dependence on conditions, pure and empty, mysterious and still, its origin unfathomable—thus called \"self-so.\" It cannot be divided into inner and outer by self or other, nor can its form or substance be determined by existence or nonexistence. Its qi cannot be fixed by yin or yang, nor can its roots and branches be traced through causes and conditions. This is the great Dao of emptiness and self-so.\n\nThose who practice can attain it; those who hear can speak of it.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** In every age, there are stubborn scholars and common followers mired in convention. Hearing that the Dao is self-so, they claim no cultivation is needed, causing practitioners to lose the means of entering the Dao. Thus, these words urge adherence: if one can follow principle in practice and act according to the teachings, one can attain truth—hence \"can attain.\" Those who hear the Dao and practice it all attain the method; speaking of the Dao, their words all accord with principle—thus initially called \"can speak.\"\n\nThose who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.\n\n**Chongxuanzi’s note:** Knowing that the wondrous Dao is not a dharma of form or sound, it cannot be explained through words. To name it with form or sound is to distance oneself from the Dao.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** Principle is originally without words; words are borrowed to elucidate principle. Once principle is profoundly realized, one naturally forgets words—hence \"those who know do not speak.\" Those who cling to teachings become deluded, insisting words are correct. Failing to grasp principle, they are called \"those who speak do not know.\"\n\nThe reason for speaking is to communicate through sound.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** \"Communicate\" means to connect and understand. Since those who know do not speak and those who speak do not know, why then do sages compose mysterious words? It is to borrow words to convey principle, for the Dao is originally without words. Thus, they discuss through words to mutually illuminate.\n\n**Liu’s note:** To awaken the unenlightened, words are necessary. Explaining this through words, that is understood—this is called \"mutually illuminating.\"\n\nThose who do not know the Dao dispute through words.\n\n**Liu’s note:** Failing to grasp the mysterious origin, they vainly contend over names and principles.\n\nWithout hearing or speaking, one does not know the reason why.\n\n**Chongxuanzi’s note:** Those who have attained understanding speak not, nor do they expound, naturally aligning with the true and constant. The common crowd, hearing nothing and speaking nothing, cannot awaken to the Dao—thus they do not know the causes and conditions of cultivating the great Dao.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** \"The reason why\" refers to the roots of principle, teachings, truth and falsehood, good and evil. If sages did not speak and common people did not hear, how would they know the karmic consequences of good and evil or the right and wrong of truth and falsehood? Teaching opens the mechanism of the wordless, allowing one to first know the supreme principle never before heard. Only then can one grasp the \"therefore\" and understand the \"reason why.\" The words spoken and the principles expounded are beneficial in this regard.\n\nFor example, those who know music recognize sound through strings.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** Sound does not arise from emptiness; it must come from strings. Principle is not self-evident; it is ultimately revealed through words.\n\nThe heart knows its words, but the mouth cannot convey them.\n\n**Chongxuanzi’s note:** Those who know music distinguish tones through strings; those who practice the Dao distinguish its purport through words. Both are without form or color, subtle and wondrously profound. The heart understands, but the mouth cannot express it.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** The heart knows the subtleties of sound, but the tongue is insufficient to convey them. The wisdom that embodies profound principle cannot be fully explored by shallow discourse. The Dao is deep and wondrous; those who know do not speak.\n\nLiu states: Silk and bamboo produce sound, yet even those who understand it cannot fully explain it—how much less can one speak of the Dao, which has no form or appearance? How could those who know it ever put it into words?\n\nXu states: The subtle and wondrous Dao transcends speech, and thus those who know it do not speak.\n\nTo recognize the sorrow in sound is to inwardly reflect upon it.\n\nLiu states: To lose a loved one and then regain them—would this not evoke joyous leaping? To be lost in the Dao and then awaken—could one not weep in sorrow? To inwardly reflect upon sound is to abandon words and contemplate principle.\n\nThe heart commands the mouth to speak, yet speech does not know.\n\nXu states: The heart can illuminate the Dao, and desires the mouth to speak, but speech becomes delusion—hence it is said to \"not know.\"\n\nChongxuanzi states: The Dao is as difficult to describe as music; only the heart fully comprehends it, not the mouth. To speak of it in confusion is already to deviate from the Dao.\n\nLiu states: Speech arises from the heart, yet the mouth does not know the heart—thus one forgets words to seek meaning.\n\n**Chapter Two: The Dao’s Profound Depth**\n\nLaozi says: The Dao is profoundly deep, the abyss of emptiness and origin.\n\nWei states: \"Deep\" means ultimate; \"abyss\" means hidden. The body of the Dao is emptiness and origin, yet it encompasses all phenomena—hence it is called the profound abyss.\n\nXu states: Its depth resides at the center of the cosmos; its hiddenness is the treasury of the ten thousand things. Its emptiness can embrace heaven and earth; its origin gives birth to being and non-being.\n\nThough you have heard its explanation, your heart does not yet glow crimson.\n\nChongxuanzi states: I fear that Master Yin, though sincere in seeking the Dao, lacks the reality of diligent practice. To make this clear, I offer this warning.\n\nRenzizi states: This is a warning and an exhortation. *Wei* means subtle; *dan* means red. The profound and abstruse Dao, the principle of emptiness and origin—even with a sincere and subtle heart, it remains difficult to know. How much less can a shallow mind or weak resolve comprehend it? One must practice deeply, believe firmly, and thus attain realization.\n\nWhy is this so? Because writing cannot exhaust speech.\n\nXu states: Why can one not fully grasp its subtlety and wonder? Because writing cannot exhaust speech, nor speech exhaust meaning.\n\nLiu states: Speech conveys principle; writing records speech. Since principle is boundless, how can writing exhaust it?\n\nThe written passages in the scriptures are studied to achieve mutual understanding.\n\nXu states: The scriptures record their essential purport but do not detail every intricacy—thus they are not easily mastered. They require scholars to delve deeply, savor their flavor, trace their origins and ends, and observe their subtle threads to achieve mutual enlightenment.\n\nLiu states: The scriptures convey principle; grasping principle leads to mutual affirmation.\n\nYou must treasure this and inwardly contemplate it.\n\nLiu states: Preserve its teachings; ponder its principles.\n\nThe natural Dao does not make appointments with you.\n\nLiu states: The Dao spans past and present; those who diligently cultivate it attain it. Those who attain it comprehend it intuitively—it cannot be predetermined.\n\nOverjoyed, he bows twice and asks, \"How should one pursue learning?\"\n\nChongxuanzi states: As Laozi’s exhortation grows earnest, the disciple, filled with reverence, bows to receive it, hoping to follow it faithfully. He dares to ask: What method of learning aligns with the Dao?\n\n**Chapter Three: Cultivating Skillfully**\n\nLaozi says: One who skillfully practices the written arts must compose its text with care.\n\nXu states: *Wei* means to cultivate; *sui* means to stabilize. If a student wishes to cultivate the sacred scriptures and immortal teachings, preserving authenticity and contemplating the wondrous to act without acting, they must first calm the mind and settle the will, seeking the meaning of the text. Only after grasping its meaning can they cultivate skillfully; only through skillful cultivation can their work be accomplished.\n\nChongxuanzi states: When the text is refined, matters proceed smoothly; when matters proceed smoothly, principles become vast. When the text is concise, matters are precise; when matters are precise, principles become refined. Both vast and refined, one may be said to have mastered the text.\n\nOne who skillfully discusses and penetrates its affairs must thoroughly understand its words.\n\nChongxuanzi states: When the text is refined and vast, and the words are comprehensive and penetrating, the meaning of the scriptures is fully realized.\n\nExert yourself and practice diligently—you will attain the Dao.\n\nChongxuanzi states: Refined text and penetrating words, coupled with diligent effort and earnest study, are the steps to attaining the Dao.\n\nLiu states: Those who study the text master writing; those who understand words can discourse. Those who exert themselves and practice diligently attain the Dao. From this, we know the Dao can be learned.\n\nTo act rightly is to be without fault; rightness resides within itself.\n\nRenzizi states: In cultivating the right Dao, one learns what is not learned, does what is not done—there is no rightness to be righted, no fault to be faulted. Thus, to act rightly is to be without fault. Though the heart may not seek to be right, rightness naturally returns to it. Not embracing the crooked, the crooked departs of itself.\n\nRenzizi states: The crooked consists of external affairs and unnatural actions. Not engaging in improper deeds or burdensome pursuits—hence it is said the crooked departs of itself.\n\nThis is called \"acting without acting,\" and the Dao naturally assists.\n\nChongxuanzi states: When every thought is right, who would dare to be crooked? With rightness present, the crooked vanishes, and the true Dao aids—this is what is meant by \"acting without acting.\"\n\nRenzizi states: Without fault in rightness, rightness naturally attains. Not embracing the crooked, the crooked naturally departs. This is the natural Dao bringing blessings.\n\nOne who is not skillful in sacrifices causes ghosts and spirits to avoid them.\n\nLiu states: The crooked seek blessings through excessive sacrifices to ghosts and spirits, but ghosts and spirits detest their deceit and jealousy. The upright make no such requests, keeping a respectful distance and dwelling in humility—thus ghosts and spirits avoid them.\n\nNot laboring the spirits, one receives a mandate without limit.\n\nRenzizi states: Those who nurture life keep their bodies pure; those who cultivate the heart keep their spirits still. Stillness means no labor; purity means no defilement. Without labor or defilement, one’s body aligns with the Dao, and the Dao aligns with the body—life has no predetermined end.\n\nLiu states: Laboring the spirits and nurturing the form leads to birth and death; not laboring or nurturing, life extends naturally.\n\nWithout advancement or retreat, who can scheme against you?\n\nXu states: \"Building virtue as if stealing\" means no advancement; \"advancing the Dao as if retreating\" means no retreat. Harmonizing light without shining, blending with the dust without defilement—flowing with things, none recognize you. Thus, demons cannot test you, desires cannot sway you. With an empty and formless heart, who can scheme against you?\n\nLiu states: With no thought of profit or harm, where lies advancement or retreat? Following reason and yielding to fate—what need is there for scheming? To act for this is to attain this—is this not natural?\n\nXu states: \"This\" refers to this very thing. To act for this without acting, to engage in this without engagement—thus attaining the true Dao—how could this not be natural? Li states: This concludes the proper way. To act rightly is to return to rightness; to distance oneself from the perverse is to banish perversity. This is what it means to act for this and attain this. \"Is this not natural?\" means that this *is* natural.\n\nLiu states: The essence of gold and jade is not beautiful at any given time; the rightness of the perfected person is not enacted at any given time. Rejoicing, I bow my head—now I have heard the command.\n\nLiu states: Revering the Dao and honoring the master, one offers respect and receives instruction.\n\n**Chapter Four: Acting with Caution**\nLaozi states: Act with caution, treasure it in your heart.\n\nXu states: Be cautious of transgressing precepts and commandments, diligently practice the pure conduct. Treasure the Dao and esteem virtue, embrace authenticity and hold fast to the One.\n\nLiu states: Admonitions urge cultivation.\n\nI shall journey far, yet we shall meet without appointment.\n\nLiu states: Desiring to go to Jambudvīpa, those of the same resonance respond—how could this require an appointment? Yin Xi received the words with profound sincerity, then at the pass claimed illness, abandoned his position, and dwelled alone in a secluded chamber.\n\nLiu states: The paths of stillness and chaos diverge; affairs cannot be managed in both. Without forsaking fame and profit, seeking the Dao is truly difficult. With tranquil detachment, he pondered the Dao, his will steadfast in guarding the One.\n\nLi states: Free from desires, tranquil and detached—this is *tranquil detachment*. Doubts dispelled, the true remains—this is *pondering the Dao*. Emotions not drifting—thus \"steadfast will.\" The heart without discrimination—thus \"guarding the One.\"\n\nLiu states: Preserving wholeness without action.\n\nHe delved into the root of emptiness, dissecting the subtlest mysteries.\n\nLi states: *Emptiness* is the essence of the Dao. Here, Yin Xi pondered the essence of emptiness to its utmost, exhausting the source of the root. *The subtlest mysteries* refer to the wondrous principle. *Yi* (乙) signifies \"one,\" *mi* (密) signifies \"subtle.\" The wondrous principle is singular; the heart of the Dao is only subtle. When one comprehends and distinguishes it, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature—this is what is meant by \"dissecting the subtlest mysteries.\"\n\nWei states: Though he wove the most wondrous words to respond to Wei Boyang, his heart remained serene, never uttering a word—thus \"the inner intent does not emerge.\"\n\nLi states: *Wondrous words* are the profound teachings. *Observing* (戳) encompasses all that is vast; *weaving* (缕) penetrates all that is minute. Exploring the great Dao, exhausting the profound and subtle, elucidating this mysterious origin, and penetrating the root of these teachings—devoted solely to the Dharma, without extraneous thoughts—thus \"the inner intent does not emerge.\"\n\nLiu states: *The subtlest mysteries* are like the most hidden and secret. Probing the profound words, inwardly one clarifies and illuminates, without expending spirit and thought in external pursuit.\n\nReciting the text ten thousand times, his sincerity and contemplation pierced through.\n\nXu states: *Refinement* is the utmost of subtlety; *sincerity* is the depth of truth; *piercing* is penetration. Here, Guan Yin recited the scripture ten thousand times, exhausting the most refined principles, deepening his true sincerity, and penetrating the mysteries of the void with his contemplation.\n\nAccording to the *True Records*, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: \"Recite the *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Virtue* ten thousand times, and the cloud chariot will come to welcome you.\" Judging by this, is it only that the scripture is distant and wondrous? It is also through the piercing of sincerity and contemplation that one can summon the cloud chariots and feathered canopies.\n\nLi states: Accumulating merit through the teachings, awakening to the profound through principle—this does not come from carelessness but must arise from sincerity. Principle and teaching are mirrored in emptiness; when the boundaries of wisdom are unobstructed, illumination penetrates all—thus \"sincerity and contemplation pierce through.\"\n\nCultivating authenticity to refine the body, one can penetrate the mysteries.\n\nXu states: Practicing true simplicity to refine the body, the radiance of essence abides—thus one can penetrate the mysterious and reach the wondrous.\n\nDiscoursing on the source of the ultimate, one can attain immortality.\n\nChong states: This describes how Guan Yin, after receiving the Dao from Laozi, devoted himself to its cultivation with sincerity. Claiming illness, he withdrew from the world, abandoned glory and rank, and with a heart stilled in an empty chamber, his will was wholly directed toward the true. Taking tranquil detachment as the pivot of the Dao and emptiness as its dwelling, he cultivated in secret, delving into the profound and exhausting the subtle. Studying and reciting the two scriptures with a devotion surpassing ten thousand repetitions, he ultimately penetrated the source and grasped the essentials, attaining long life and immortality. He ascended to the rank of Master Wen Shi and attained the position of the Supreme Perfected One.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Image of the Dao**\nLaozi states: The image of the Dao has no form or end; it is indistinct, seemingly absent yet present.\n\nWei states: It cannot be seen—thus \"no form\"; it cannot be grasped—thus \"no end.\" *Indistinct* refers to the absence of signs in its transformations. If one says it is absent, the ten thousand images are bounded by it; if one says it is present, its stillness and silence cannot be perceived—thus \"seemingly absent yet present.\"\n\nXu states: *Image* is pattern, semblance. The Dao takes spirit and qi as its essence. Though it has patterns and images, they resemble form yet are formless—only luminous traces and radiant semblances, upright and proper, yet without shape or thing. Seemingly present yet absent, seemingly absent yet present—thus \"indistinct, seemingly absent yet present.\"\n\nIt is like a seed before it sprouts, when branches, leaves, and roots are not yet seen.\n\nXu states: When a tree has not yet sprouted, its branches, leaves, roots, and stems are unseen—just as when the image of the Dao is not yet manifest, it is dark and empty.\n\nLiu states: Though the branches and leaves are not yet seen, one cannot say it is absent; though the Dao has no image, one cannot say it is not present.\n\nIt unites earth, water, fire, and wind; the four seasons pass in cycles.\n\nXu states: The four great elements unite to form the tree; the four seasons come and go—thus there is growth, decay, gathering, and dispersal.\n\nIt is like the union of spirit and qi, which transforms to form the image of the Dao. If the Mysterious One has not returned, and its pervasion is incomplete, there will be departures and reunions.\n\nQi is the life-giving earth; when gathered and congealed, it gradually solidifies.\n\nChong states: Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, the myriad spirits and beings—all receive the soft and harmonious qi of the Dao to form their solid and great essences. This gradual accumulation and gathering is not the work of a single day.\n\nLi states: Life arises from qi, thus qi is called \"life.\" When earth first congeals, it remains fragile; only after long accumulation does it become firm—this is what is meant by \"form already great.\"\n\nFlavors differ, forms are unequal:\nSweet, bitter, pungent, salty, sour.\n\nChong states: From the five phases arise the five flavors; from the five elements arise the five spirits. Spirits nourish internally, flavors sustain externally. The five phases wax and wane, thus they are not equal; the five qi transform and change, thus they do not flourish simultaneously. If one can embody and circulate them, draw upon and nurture them, one ascends to the life of the superior person.\n\nQi moves in greater or lesser measure; strength and weakness are indeed unequal.\n\nWei states: When all beings first receive qi, its purity and coarseness vary; natures and dispositions differ, hence strength, weakness, abundance, and scarcity are not uniform.\n\nLiu states: All things that move or grow take qi as the root of their beginning. Yet when they reach fullness and grandeur, their natures and qualities differ, and the movement of qi is also partial—what they receive is inherently distinct.\n\nThough they emerge from the same source, names and colors differ, each generating its own intent and cause.\n\nChong states: When qi generates one another, they all draw from the Dao. Yet according to what they receive, names and colors vary. Good and evil, strength and weakness follow the same principle. What the heart generates is called \"intent\"; what perception receives is called \"cause.\"\n\nLi states: All draw from the Dao and receive from qi, thus it is said they emerge from the same source. Yet names and lineages differ, colors and kinds vary—thus it is said names and colors differ. Those whose hearts are pure are upright and good; those whose perceptions are turbid are perverse and evil. Conduct differs, aspirations and natures vary—thus each generates its own intent and cause.\n\nLiu states: All that has life emerges from the Dao. Yet names and titles differ, patterns and hues vary. Like gathers with like, kinds separate—intent and cause differ accordingly.\n\nFrom these differing natures and conducts, they receive bodily forms.\n\nLi states: Since natures differ, conduct also varies. Whether good or evil, the blessings they receive follow their forms—flowing through the six paths, dying and being reborn.\n\nThey contain and nurture the Dao of yin and yang, relying upon and depending on it as kin.\n\n*(Note: 倚 is also written as 寄.)*\n\nWei states: Once contained by yin and yang, they receive their bodies through the harmony of conception. Yet beings, deluded and confused, do not know they emerge from the same Dao. Thus, following what they depend upon, each takes its own as kin.\n\nLiu states: From those of middling wisdom downward, even to insects, all receive their forms by dependence and take them as kin. Thus *Zhuangzi* says: \"Once receiving its form, it does not forget until its end.\"\n\nThe Way of life is not of one kind; all people are not the same.\n\nLi states: The Way of generation and transformation is manifold. What is called \"human\" in one case is called \"non-human\" in another. The ten thousand kinds differ—thus they are not of one kind.\n\nXu states: The transformations of yin and yang are called the \"Way of life\"; the harmony of the two qi is called the \"power of life.\" What virtue generates, the Dao transforms. The ten thousand things, the ten thousand forms—kinds and types are not singular. All plants and beings, human and non-human, all receive from virtue and the Dao before they are born and take form.\n\nOriginally emerging from the Void Origin, through resonance and stimulation, spirit is born.\n\nXu states: The Void Origin is the Dao. It is said that the generation and transformation of beings and things all emerge from the Dao. When essence and qi harmonize and resonate with one another, spirit is born. Spirit congeals and transforms into the human body’s gods—this illustrates how the Void can generate the solid, and the Origin can generate existence.\n\nChong states: The vastness of heaven and earth, the abundance of the ten thousand kinds—moving and still, their forms differ; flying and sinking, their tendencies vary. Yet all transform from the Origin into existence, receive life from the Dao. Accumulated qi becomes spirit, all sharing the root of transformation.\n\nIt is like one who plucks a string: the hand moves, and the sound is transmitted.\n\nLiu states: The string originally has no sound; only when struck does it become music. Just as the Void Origin is fundamentally quiescent, only through resonance and stimulation is spirit born.\n\nGong, shang, jue, zhi, yu—\nThe breath of the mouth, the origin of exhalation and inhalation.\n\nLi states: 攘 means \"to pluck.\" The hand plucks the string, and sound begins to emit. The mouth exhales and inhales qi, and voice begins to resound. Without the mouth’s origin, there would be no sound; only through the string can vibration occur. Thus we know the mouth is the root of sound, the hand the origin of tone.\n\nExtending this to things, without the Dao, they cannot be born.\n\n*(Strings refer to zither, se, zheng, and zhu;\nWinds refer to xiao, di, songs, and chants—this is the analogy being drawn.)*\n\nBody, mouth, and intent are the roots; the Dao emerges as the supreme origin.\n\nOriginally quiescent in emptiness and stillness—thus the Dao is spontaneous.\n\nLi states: As soon as there is life, body, mouth, and intent are possessed. From where do body, mouth, and intent arise? They must derive from the Dao as their origin. Thus it is said the Dao emerges as the supreme origin—this completes the analogy.\n\nChong states: The breath of the mouth, the movements of the body—all arise from the operation of intent. Intent is spirit; what generates spirit is the Dao. When intent is clear and pure, without action, spirit is at peace and accords with the Dao. When intent is restless and competitive, with desires, spirit is lost and life is harmed. Only by concentrating the heart in emptiness and stillness can one unite with the Dao of spontaneity.\n\nLiu states: The body’s intent is fundamentally pure, without any defilements. Tracing its source, it is the natural nature of the Dao.\n\nThe five notes stir and shake, then become entangled with music and color.\n\nChong states: When the five notes are hidden in profound silence, one embodies the Dao in tranquility and joy. When the five notes flow through the pitch pipes, they move things to sorrow and happiness—this illustrates how simplicity scatters into vessels, purity dissipates into shallowness.\n\nLi states: Earlier, the spontaneous Dao was shown to be fundamentally pure and still, without seeing or hearing, neither color nor sound—this is the profound source, the wondrous root of the utmost mystery. Now it speaks of life after birth, following desires and indulging emotions, losing the principle of emptiness and stillness, forsaking the spontaneous Dao. Hearing the stirring of the five notes, the ear becomes attached; seeing the blue and yellow of the five colors, the eye becomes fixated. Enmeshed in the delusions of action, they are detained by sound and color.\n\nScattering yang to become brightness, spreading qi to form the six senses.\n\nLiu states: Music and sensual pleasures intertwine, generating without cease. Thus scattered yang harmonizes with radiance, becoming the clarity of passions and desires, forming the six senses to sustain and serve the body. From this arise life and death, and the Dao scatters and spreads into divisions.\n\nLi states: The three karmic actions become causes, the six dusts construct defilement. Through good and evil deeds, one receives bodies of sin and blessing, flowing through the three realms, shuttling within the five paths. One birth, one death—now suffering, now joy—yet the origin remains unknown. Hence it is called \"spread into divisions.\"\n\nLiu states: The six senses sustain the body, yet turn to harm it. Unrestrained cravings link life and death in an unbroken chain. When spirit departs, form remains, and separation occurs naturally. Turning from the root to pursue the branch, scattering simplicity to dilute purity.\n\nXu states: Abandoning the root source to follow these flowing branches, scattering plain simplicity to craft benevolence and righteousness, diluting pure truth into falsity and shallowness—departing from the Dao to practice goodness, acting with treacherous virtue.\n\nLi states: Scattering simplicity, thus it is said to turn from the root to pursue the branch; hence the phrase \"diluting purity.\" Losing that true source, one sinks into the realm of the vulgar, forsaking the conduct of sincerity and thickness to vie in the winds of shallowness.\n\nChong states: Those inwardly enlightened make their hearts empty and luminous; those outwardly enlightened exhaust their thoughts in toil. From this, deluded thoughts arise, and one drowns in life and death. The Dao does not scatter nor lose its purity—all forget the root to chase the branch, drifting endlessly in restless wandering, which the world takes as normal. The source of the Great Dao, the origin of the Nameless, transforms this ordinary nature, returning it to simplicity and restoring truth. Those who cultivate this may realize the Dao beyond the ordinary.\n\nLiu states: Revealing that life and death are not eternal, urging a return to the root and restoration of destiny.\n\n*End of Xisheng Jing Jizhu, Scroll One*\n\n[Textual notes omitted in translation]\n\nXisheng Jing Jizhu, Scroll Two\nHua Yang Wei Chuxuan\nJu Qu Xu Daomiao\nChong Xuanzi\n\n**Chapter Six: The Dao Gives Birth**\n\nLaozi said:\nI tell you of the root of the Dao of life,\nI show you your natural state.\n\nLi [Rong] states:\nWhen the One Qi stirs, the ten thousand kinds unfold,\nall taking naturalness as their origin and the Perfect Dao as their root.\nYet those who chase the branch are many,\nwhile those who return to the root are few.\nI tell and show them this,\nurging them to honor the root,\nshedding these encumbrances\nto enter that natural state.\n\nAs for the birth of the ten thousand things,\nemotions and actions entwine.\nChong [Xuanzi] says:\nThe wondrous root of life-transformation is the Dao of naturalness,\nthe father and mother of the ten thousand things,\nthe primordial origin of Heaven and Earth.\nI wish for Guan Yin to revere and honor it,\nand so repeat this admonition.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nEmotions arise within, actions manifest without,\nentangled and bound—how could they merely be \"entwined\"?\nAs destruction gives way to completion,\nas extinction gives way to rebirth.\nLi [Rong] says:\nBy causes revolving, going and returning without cease,\nas destruction yields completion, death here gives birth there,\nas extinction yields rebirth, emerging from darkness into light.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nThis is destroyed, that is completed;\nthat is extinguished, this is born.\nThus the Five Phases form,\nyin and yang conjoined.\nXu [Daomiao] says:\nThe Four Qi divide and reign, forming the Five Phases.\nThe Five Phases mutually engender and destroy,\nmutually destroy and complete.\nWhen yin conjoins, there is extinction and destruction;\nwhen yang conjoins, there is birth and completion.\nChong [Xuanzi] says:\nThe Five Phases differ, yet the Dao’s radiance is one;\nyin and yang diverge, yet the Dao’s radiance is impartial.\nThe Five Phases have extinction and birth—\nlike the alternation of spring and autumn;\nyin and yang have completion and destruction—\nlike the shifting of kalpas.\nThe Dao resides between the Five Phases and the Two Qi,\nunchanging in its oneness,\nand thus becomes the master of the Five Phases and the Two Qi,\nabiding eternally.\n\nRevolving and transforming,\nthey become the essence of things.\nWei [Chuxuan] says:\nThe Five Phases rise and fall in turn,\nyin and yang come and go—\njust as in the human realm,\none dies and one is born.\nTransforming and revolving,\nthe essence of things never ceases.\n\nI ponder this Dao,\nits root emerging from the profound and obscure.\nLi [Rong] says:\nThis Dao is the Dao of life, death, and transformation.\nThings, being obstructed, have exhausted their use,\nyet by relying on the Dao, they attain passage.\nOnly then can stagnation be dispelled.\nIts root emerges from the Dao,\nyet the Dao is beyond thought and discussion,\nboundless and unfathomable,\nindivisible and ineffable.\nI borrow the term \"profound and obscure\"—\nit is not truly profound and obscure.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nAll arise from the formless.\nThe foolish do not discern or know,\nclaiming they are simply born.\nChong [Xuanzi] says:\nThe Dao’s origin is without beginning,\nprofound and distant,\nthe root of the ten thousand things.\nThe birth of the ten thousand things\nall receives the Dao’s radiance.\nAt its root, the radiance is singular;\nthings obtain it and are born.\nThe foolish do not know,\nbelieving they are not born of the Dao.\nLi [Rong] says:\nThe foolish, lacking knowledge,\nsay they are simply born of themselves,\nnot of the Dao—\nthis is delusion from the root.\nYou lack the Dao-eye,\nhow can you know the birth of spirits?\nWei [Chuxuan] says:\nThis clarifies that the Dao of life, death, and transformation\nemerges from the profound and obscure,\ndeep and unknowable.\nYet the foolish, complacent in their fleeting lives,\ntake transient joy as contentment.\nNot being those who embody the Dao,\nhow could they know that humans obtain the One to live,\nand ghosts and spirits obtain the One to become numinous?\nLi [Rong] says:\nThe Dao-eye sees beyond the formless,\nilluminating the subtle and obscure.\n\"Humans\" refers to the numinous among the living.\nThe deluded, far from knowing the Dao,\ncannot even know themselves.\nThus I say: You lack the Dao-eye,\nhow can you know the birth of spirits?\nAs the saying goes: He who knows others is wise;\nhe who knows himself is enlightened.\nOnly such a one is truly wise and clear,\nknowing all without exception.\n\nHeaven and Earth, humans and things—\nall fill the vast and empty primordial sack.\nXu [Daomiao] says:\nThe Two Modes and the ten thousand things\nare all born within the vast and empty primordial sack,\nfilling the cosmos.\nChong [Xuanzi] says:\nThe Dao’s radiance pervades Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things,\nall emerging from the primordial,\nsharing the same origin yet bearing different names.\nLi [Rong] says:\nHigh Heaven, deep Earth,\nhuman relationships and the myriad kinds,\ngreat and small, foolish and wise—\nnone arise of themselves or transform alone.\nAll fundamentally emerge from the empty and primordial,\nborn of the Dao together—\nthus they are \"the same.\"\nYet their natures differ and their names vary—\nthus they are \"different.\"\nThe abandoned bellows is but a metaphor:\nfrom the bellows emerges qi,\nfrom the flute emerges sound,\nfrom the empty and primordial emerge the ten thousand images.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nThough blown in myriad ways, their names differ.\n\nThis too is fundamentally not so—\nit depends on proper use.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nAffairs have reversal and compliance,\nprinciples have flexibility and constancy.\nRight and wrong are not fixed.\nThose who cling to them\nmay sometimes stop when it is time to stop,\nor proceed when it is time to proceed.\nIt depends on proper use—\ndo not exhaust their root.\n\"That\" is not \"that,\"\nonly then can one know its recognition.\nChong [Xuanzi] says:\nRight and wrong differ,\nyet the Dao’s function is without error.\nIt cannot be explained by names,\nnor distinguished by right and wrong.\nThe wondrous Dao is simply One.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nForget words to grasp meaning,\nand faith in the Dao will be sincere.\n\nAlign with those of clear understanding,\ndo not contend with the foolish.\nLi [Rong] says:\nFollow enlightened teachers,\nrely on good companions,\ndiscuss gains and losses,\nknow right and wrong.\nTo merely argue over external matters’ right and wrong,\nunaware of the harm and benefit to self-cultivation—\ndo not engage in petty disputes with the ignorant,\nwasting words in vain contention,\nfor it yields no benefit.\nThus I say: Do not contend with the foolish.\n\nYou must seek the correct teaching,\ndo not trust in deviant listening.\nLi [Rong] says:\nForgetting words to grasp principle,\nnon-action to accord with the real—\nthis is the correct teaching.\nAction that burdens the real,\ndesire that harms nature—\nthis is deviant listening.\n\"Do not trust\" means to withdraw the gaze and return the hearing,\nnot to indulge in deviant views or listening.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nThose who meet the moment follow the correct principle;\nthose who stray follow the deviant.\n\nHow can one know the deviant?\nYou are swayed by things.\nXu [Daomiao] says:\nThe heart races toward the realm of desire and beauty,\nthe body rushes along the path of fame and profit.\nDemonic spirits and ghosts disturb the spirit,\nglory and wealth delude the will.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nNot meeting the true essence,\none is swayed by things.\n\nHow can one know the foolish?\nThey do not examine the truth of words.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nThose who do not know the naturalness of the great Dao,\nyet are swayed by external things—\nthese are all deviant people.\nThose who do not examine the truth of Daoist words,\nyet laugh at them—\nthese are all foolish people.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nClinging to delusion, guarding ignorance,\nthe subtlest signs remain unseen.\n\nTo practice the Dao, inquire of the Dao;\nto study the scriptures, inquire of the scriptures.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nTo know the Dao as real and inquire to practice it—\nthis is not deviance.\nTo know the scriptures as true and inquire to ponder them—\nthis is not foolishness.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nThose who practice the Dao respond without fixed method;\nthose who study the scriptures discuss their traditions.\n\nTo inquire without grasping root and branch—\nthe foolish remain in darkness.\nLi [Rong] says:\nThe Dao is principle; the scriptures are teaching.\nThose who dwell in unilluminated darkness grow ever more obscured.\nTo practice the Dao and inquire of the Dao is to seek principle until it is understood;\nto study the scriptures and inquire of the scriptures is to request teaching until it is comprehended.\nNow, the inferior scholar outwardly does not recognize teaching,\ninwardly does not grasp principle—\nnot knowing the root,\nnot recognizing teaching,\nnot knowing the branch.\nWith both root and branch, principle and teaching,\nall utterly unrecognized,\nthey are like the blind walking in darkness—\nthus called \"darkness.\"\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nThe root is the Dao; the scriptures are the branch.\nThose who speculate without knowing root and branch—\nthese are truly the foolish and dark.\n\nOnly knowing to seek blessings,\nnot knowing the entanglement of sin.\nLi [Rong] says:\nNot knowing to act rightly and establish merit,\nbut instead trusting in deviance to seek blessings—\nbefore the fleeting blessing arrives,\nthe ultimate calamity has already come.\nThis is to be bound by the entanglement of sin.\n\nOnly knowing to nourish the body,\nnot knowing to punish the form.\nLi [Rong] says:\nWith deliberate flavors to nourish this body,\nthe thickness of life after life\nmoves it toward death—\nnot coming from without,\nbut precisely from the six senses encountering this harm.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nThe foolish do good to seek blessings,\nyet also do evil to invite sin.\nThey provide for clothing and food to nourish the body,\nyet increase extravagance and beauty to destroy life.\nThus, cutting off evil brings the meeting of blessings;\nabandoning desire preserves the body.\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"All seek blessings;\nI alone seek to preserve wholeness.\"\nThe form of an infant—\ncherish its thickness and sincerity.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nThose who seek blessings and nourish the body\nshould be like an infant’s thickness and sincerity.\n\nDisregarding form to avoid completion,\nknowing life is not eternal.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nThickness means purity; sincerity means simplicity.\nCompletion means achievement.\nThose who study the Dao should know the value of an infant’s form,\nnourishing its pure and simple nature.\nSuddenly, form arises of itself,\nwithout intention to complete it;\nso too, life arises of itself,\nwithout ever knowing its beginning.\n\nWithout treading the path of excess,\none may attain enduring existence.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nTreading means practice.\nExcess means overindulgence in preserving life;\nbrightness means clear perception.\nWithout practicing these two,\none approaches the infant’s purity and simplicity,\ndrawing near the Dao of long life.\n\nWhat profound meaning is there?\nIt is but the desire to overthrow one another.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nAll people turn from black toward white, emerging from darkness into light. Yet here it speaks of \"not treading the path of excessive brightness\"—what profound meaning lies therein? Excessive brightness defies convention, and convention thus resents it. Only by blending with the turbid may one attain the subtle wonder of enduring existence—its marvel resides precisely here.\n\nThe bond of father and child is deep, yet not sufficient to heed one another.\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe duty between master and disciple is weighty, the affection between father and child profound. When a child errs, he must follow his father’s rightness; when a younger brother strays, he must adhere to his teacher’s goodness. Thus, one honors them as master and father, valuing their instruction and heeding their admonitions.\n\nDo not clamor or clamor with indignation.\nMocked by those near and far.\nLi [Yue] says:\n\"Clamor\" refers to arrogance and strident noise. A disloyal younger brother, an unfilial son—one who defies his father’s command, rejects his teacher’s decree, rebels against his superiors, and forsakes the rites of youth—becomes the laughingstock of others. The admonition \"do not\" warns against such conduct.\n\nConcealing evil and extolling good is what the noble person reveres.\nXu [Yue] says:\n\"Reveres\" means to esteem. When evil is extolled, evil hides; when good is extolled, good becomes known. Thus, the noble person esteems this.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Deviance and Rectitude**\nLaozi says:\nDeviant and upright teachings all respond to nature.\nThus, misfortune and fortune arise from the roots one sows.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nThose who plant upright roots are naturally upright; those who plant deviant roots are naturally deviant. The deviant bring misfortune upon themselves; the upright bring fortune upon themselves—is this not nature’s response?\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe human heart harbors both resistance and compliance, and conduct thus encompasses both good and evil. As one’s own actions are, so too are the teachings one imparts. The magnanimous noble person instructs others in uprightness—hence \"upright teachings.\" The envious petty person teaches others to deviate—hence \"deviant teachings.\" In deviance, though one may not seek it, deviance comes of itself; in uprightness, though one may seek it, uprightness comes of itself. Such is the response—deviance is repaid with misfortune, uprightness with fortune. The correspondence of good and evil is never indiscriminate; retribution is never amiss. It is like planting seeds—each root yields its distinct fruit, clearly differentiated.\n\nAs one receives, so one’s seed and kernel become manifest.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nHaving received this life, one receives this form. Good and evil, fortune and misfortune follow one’s conduct, just as grasses and trees grow, each distinct according to its seed and kernel.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nUpright and deviant conduct stand before us; fortune and misfortune respond thereafter. Only when signs appear and effects become evident does one recognize the cause—thus it is said, \"As one receives, so one’s seed and kernel become manifest.\"\n\nHere the Way diverges, and words distinguish the false from the true.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nThe essence of the Way is vast and all-pervading, originally without true or false. The rise of true and false stems from teachings. The false Way nurtures form; the true Way nurtures spirit.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nActions that accord with principle are upright; those that contravene truth are deviant. Deviance is empty and false—hence \"false.\" Uprightness is ultimate—hence \"true.\" The true enters the subtle and thus nurtures spirit; the false is feeble and thus nurtures form. To nurture form means to fill the body with rich flavors; to nurture spirit means to cultivate the heart with purity.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nThose who act and desire nurture form; those who are without action and desire nurture spirit. Those who nurture form become ash and earth; those who nurture spirit can vanish and endure.\n\nThe true spirit communes with the Dao, able to vanish and endure.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nForm cannot be preserved; to preserve it through desire is thus \"false.\" To nurture spirit through non-action is to respond with serene resonance—hence \"true.\" In this state, death and life are equal in measure, existence and nonexistence alike in continuity. Thus, not to cling to existence is to be able to vanish; not to reject nonexistence is to be able to endure.\n\nXu [Yue] says:\nSpirit communes with the Dao, transforming endlessly, able to die and live, to vanish and endure.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nSerene and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating—all fetters dissolved, free in coming and going. Spirit can make form take flight and even move mountains.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nOnly spirit—swift without haste, arriving without traveling—what can it not do? Thus it can make form take flight and move mountains.\n\nForm becomes ash and earth—what awareness remains?\nLi [Yue] says:\nForm, in life, is substantial and obstructive, inherently without knowledge. In death, it becomes ash and earth—what awareness can remain?\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nThough one may nurture it abundantly, it ultimately becomes ash and earth. Since the matter is not empty, why indulge excessively?\n\nEars and eyes, sounds and colors—these ensnare the child.\nWhat the nose and mouth favor—fragrance and flavor—are foes.\nThe body is the root of affliction, tormented by pain, itching, cold, and heat.\nLi [Yue] says:\nHaving a body and breath, one is not only troubled by sounds and colors but also afflicted by fragrance and flavor, pain and itching, cold and heat—all are the root of affliction.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nSounds and colors destroy life; rich flavors cause illness. The body that depends on conditions is never at ease.\n\nThe mind schemes for the body, bringing sorrow, poison, worry, and vexation.\nI am bound by the body—knowing it to be the great calamity.\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe body is tormented by cold and heat; the heart is poisoned by sorrow and worry. Only when both heart and body are at rest can this cease. How is this achieved? One must forget the body externally and extinguish the heart internally. When body and heart are both forgotten, what affliction remains? This urges the abandonment of deliberate action.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nTo externalize the body is to be without sorrow, yet it remains akin to being burdened.\n\nObserve the ancients, regard the present—who can preserve their form intact?\nLi [Yue] says:\nGazing upon the distant past, observing the present—all are swept along by transformation, succeeded by yin and yang. Who remains whole and preserved?\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nPeng Zu and the short-lived child alike perish—how much more so the mediocre? Even I, now white-haired, know not which year will bring old age and decline.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nEven the Old Lord, who descended as a divine manifestation, still showed signs of aging, his hair grown white. How much more so for those mired in the vulgar world, buffeted by the myriad conditions of cold and heat, prosperity and decline, ceaselessly shifting and transforming—how could they attain longevity? Aging spares no year. I originally abandoned the worldly, weary of this defiled realm.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe profusion of deliberate action, the filth and leakage of the human realm—these are not worth preserving. Weary of them, I cast them aside. Embracing the primordial and guarding the One, I traverse the path to divine transcendence.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe \"primordial One\" is the Dao. To cherish the Dao and embrace virtue, to preserve the unity of the Three Characters—this is to rank among the highest sages and ultimately ascend as a radiant immortal. Yet you have not been able to guard it, instead sitting amidst the glory of office.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nHe has not been able to guard the One. Even the Gatekeeper, while in office, was still called \"glorious official\"—how much less could those dazzled by worldly emoluments ever attain the true Dao? If you can remain unmoved, your spirit will find peace.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nNot swayed by external things, the spirit remains serene and at ease. If you can relinquish desire, every undertaking will be complete.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nOne without desire finds all affairs in accord. If you can practice non-action, your resolve is known to be firm.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nTo uphold resolve through non-action requires unwavering discipline—without it, success is unattainable. Now I speak to you plainly, laying bare the exposition. Dispersing doubts and dissecting distinctions, truth and falsehood are clearly separated.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\n\"Laying bare\" means to reveal openly; \"exposition\" means to expound at length. \"Dispersing doubts\" means to clarify; \"dissecting distinctions\" means to adjudicate. Indulging the passions is false; relinquishing desire is true. Considering those lost in confusion, unable to attain profound awakening, I therefore explain with utmost clarity, that you may discern good from evil. You must receive this earnestly, revering the Dao with devotion.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nThe Dao is noble, its virtue precious—it must not be treated lightly. Where faith is insufficient, disbelief arises; thus, devotion is required. The Dao is the light that emerges; the scriptures are the first step in learning.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe benighted do not understand; only those who seek true illumination can begin to cultivate the Dao. The Dao is not attained in isolation—it must be realized through the scriptures. Thus, to grasp the principles of entering the Dao, the scriptures must come first in study.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nWithout illumination, the Dao cannot be perceived; without scriptures, there is nothing to rely upon. Bestowed upon those who can practice it, it makes no distinction between rich and poor. Its teachings and transformations are offered with joy, without partiality or favor.\n\nWei [Yue] says:\nTo those whose hearts can practice the Dao, the Dao itself emerges to bestow it. To those who delight in studying the scriptures, the scriptures themselves reveal their teachings—how could it discriminate between poverty and wealth, closeness and distance?\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe Dao makes no distinctions. It does not bar the poor nor obstruct the distant; it does not withhold teaching due to kinship or estrangement. Its essence lies in practice and in heeding its transformations. Bestowed upon those who can practice it, its texts are given to those worthy of them.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe sage responds with emptiness, aligning with the moment’s need. Without faith, there is no practice—how then could teaching or bestowal occur? The key lies in steadfast devotion to the Dharma; only then are the sacred texts conferred.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nThe utmost impartiality. Learn from my teaching, and you will not lose the true Dao.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\n\"Er\" means \"you.\" I teach you, and you should learn—only then can you succeed, not losing the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Heaven and Earth**\nThe Old Master says:\nHeaven, earth, and all beings originate from the primordial Dao.\n\nChong [Yue] says:\nThis speaks of the Two Modes and all beings—all arise from the primordial qi of the Dao. Together they emerge from the Great Simplicity, the inception of the Void and Primordial.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\n\"Primordial\" means root and origin. \"Great Simplicity\" is the pure, unblemished Dao; \"Void and Primordial\" is the profound mystery beyond being. Though the Three Powers are vast and the myriad things numerous, none do not take the pure and tranquil Dao as their root, the profound and wondrous principle as their origin. Without the Dao as their beginning, things could not be born—all are alike in this, hence it is said they \"emerge together.\"\n\nThe dim radiance of semblance, the supreme mystery of the subtlest.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nThe \"Great Simplicity\" is the initial substance of qi. It is said that heaven, earth, and the myriad things take the Dao as their origin, emerging from the inception of the Great Simplicity and entering the gateway of the Void and Non-being. Once the myriad things manifest their substance, their dim radiance becomes semblance—this is the subtle and wondrous essence.\n\nIt is like a chasm a thousand miles deep, where a faint-flowing spring lies below. Gazing upon it, the water seems turbid and shallow—how could one see through to the sand at the bottom?\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nThe Dao is only subtle and obscure, difficult to perceive or witness. Using things as metaphors opens the understanding of sentient beings. A chasm ten thousand miles deep—yet the eye can only see a few fathoms. If even the water cannot be fully seen, how could one claim to see the bottom? Water has form and substance, yet its clarity remains unseen—how much less could the formless Dao, silent and dark, be known?\n\nDark and dim, it is unknown whence it arises. It is also like the departed dead, whose spirit is no longer seen.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nEntering the spirit through profound meaning to put it to use, employing it to secure the self and exalt virtue—beyond this, none can know. This saying is true indeed! Moreover, the soul and qi pervade all places, yet even they cannot be seen after departing—how much less the dark and unfathomable Dao, which defies all knowledge of its origin?\n\nPure yin harmonizes and coalesces, yet its manifestations cannot be distinctly perceived.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nYang is life; yin is death. The dead have no yang, hence it is called \"pure yin.\" Though the harmonized coalescence possesses the power of yang’s function, it can no longer be clearly known.\n\nThe past and the just-arrived, seen as if before one’s eyes—yet even these cannot be fully understood. How then could one know what is lost or preserved?\n\nWei [Yue] says:\n\"Just-arrived\" means \"just beginning.\" The past and the just-beginning are like things seen before one’s eyes—yet even these the foolish cannot fully comprehend. How much less the dark and subtle Dao, which seems to exist yet not exist, could they ever recognize?\n\nLi [Yue] says:\n\"Past\" is what has gone; \"just-arrived\" is what has not yet come. \"Seen before one’s eyes\" is the present. With the divine eye, one sees future events; with the knowledge of past lives, one knows past dharmas; with the exhaustion of outflows, one knows the present state. Yet the deluded and obscured, who do not realize the emptiness of the Three Realms nor the quiescence of this single body—even regarding fortune and misfortune, life and death, existence and extinction, they cannot know their causes. How then could they fathom the wondrous subtleties of the true Dao?\n\nJust as one afflicted with a throat ulcer cannot convey speech to others—\n\nXu says: The subtle mechanism of the Dao cannot be expressed in words. Though the mind may grasp its meaning, the mouth cannot utter it. Like one suffering from a throat ulcer, who cannot even transmit speech, how could they discourse on the wondrous Dao?\n\nLiu says: The mute cannot convey words, just as the blind cannot perceive the Dao.\n\nTo play the notes of *gong* and *shang* for the deaf—how could they hear?\n\nLiu says: The deluded hearing the supreme Dao is like the deaf listening to *gong* and *shang*.\n\nOnly those of partial wit possess such intelligence, receiving instruction as if by direct transmission. Yet they claim to comprehend the Dao’s essence—though their innermost feelings cannot be refined.\n\n*(Variant in Li and Liu: \"claim to grasp its discourse, though their coarse nature cannot express it.\")*\n\nLi says: Only the eloquent can transmit words, and only the wise can expound the Dharma. The inarticulate may claim to convey its discourse, yet their vulgar and shallow understanding cannot truly express it. The dull-witted may profess mastery of profound teachings, yet their benighted minds remain obscure to the ultimate principle.\n\nThus they lose the root of life—how then could they fathom the origin of the Dao?\n\nLi says: Understanding the Dao’s affairs depends on the Dharma; discerning the root of life relies on wisdom. Without wisdom, one loses the root of life; with a benighted mind, how could one grasp the Dao’s origin? Hence those mired in the mundane are many, while those who return to the Dao are few.\n\nLiu says: Claiming to comprehend principle through transmitted teachings, they remain unaware of their own coarseness and ignorance, losing the profound source. Having lost the profound source, they forfeit the root of life; having forfeited the root of life, how could they know the Dao’s origin?\n\n**Chapter on Practicing the Dao**\n\nLaozi says: If you practice my Dao, you must know the origin of supreme wisdom. Wisdom does not arise alone—it always requires corresponding causes and conditions.\n\nLi says: Wisdom illuminates existence, while wisdom discerns emptiness. When both illuminate together, no principle remains obscure—hence the name \"wisdom.\" Yet the origin of wisdom is profoundly penetrating, and the root of wisdom is difficult to exhaust. To exhaust it, one must rely on an enlightened teacher; without the proper causes and conditions, wisdom will not arise.\n\nLiu says: One who understands the Dao is called \"supreme wisdom.\" Wisdom has no inherent good or evil—it arises only through conditions.\n\nEach possesses the root of past conduct, which determines destiny and fortune.\n\nLiu says: Worthiness or foolishness, nobility or baseness, wealth or poverty, long life or early death—all stem from the root of past conduct, with destiny and fortune governing their fruition.\n\nThose who share the Dao attain it; those who share virtue possess its root.\n\nLi says: The differences between foolishness and wisdom, brightness and darkness, nobility and baseness, good and evil all arise from past conduct and depend on past lives. Destiny may be long or short, fortune abundant or meager—all are recorded in former times and receive their retribution in the present. Thus, the good, sharing the Dao, attain it; sharing virtue, they gain its root. The wicked, not sharing the Dao, lose it; not sharing virtue, they lose its root.\n\nLiu says: Retribution is never in error.\n\nIf in past lives one did not study and inquire, in this life one remains close to the worldly.\n\nThus, in gain and loss, they take no joy in the Dao’s texts.\n\nLi says: In former lives, they did not delight in scriptures and Dharma—this is what it means to have not studied and inquired in past lives. In this life, lacking good teachers and virtuous friends, they fail to draw near to goodness and wisdom, like one facing a wall, ever colliding with obstacles. Truly, such fools take no joy in scriptures and texts—hence it is said: \"Thus, in gain and loss, they take no joy in the Dao’s texts.\"\n\nLiu says: Those who share in loss also delight in gain. Silk, without constant dyeing, becomes habitual through repeated exposure. Teaching knows no distinctions; accumulated practice becomes nature. If in past lives one did not study the true, how could one now aspire to the Dao? They toil their whole lives, ever close to loss.\n\nGreedy for desire, seeking profit and glory, they accept offerings and remember favors with diligence. Further bestowing wealth to deepen bonds, they do not pity the poor and destitute below.\n\nLi says: Those who share in the highest virtue are originally empty and primal, but having lost the supreme Dao, they generate much defilement. Taking glory and honor as profit, they pursue nobility and rank; regarding wealth and favors as kindness, they exchange mutual visits. They call this \"deepening bonds,\" yet show no compassion for the poor and needy—how could they have loyalty to return to the true and turn toward the Dao?\n\nLiu says: To take pride in the orphaned and pity the poor is what the common people scorn but the sage values.\n\nThey must endure much anger and suffering, with no place to settle their origin.\n\nXu says: *Chu* means \"to dwell\"; *yuan* means \"origin,\" referring to the mind. When the mind is bound to glory and profit, and emotions cling to fame and substance, fear of disgrace and honor disturbs their harmony like ice and fire. With much anger and restless emotions, their nature becomes unruly, their will and conduct inconstant—there is no place to settle their mind.\n\nWithout a bright teacher to study under, how could they resolve doubts and difficulties?\n\nLi says: When doubts remain unresolved and mysteries unpenetrated, one must rely on a bright teacher to attain awakening. To remain foolish until death makes true liberation difficult.\n\nLiu says: Those lost on the Dao follow divergent paths, with none to guide their return. The awakened are hard to encounter, and the discerning are rare. If the teacher is deluded, how can they resolve confusion? If confusion is not resolved, even broad learning is not true understanding.\n\nThus the *Book of Rites* says: \"Learning by rote memorization is insufficient to be a teacher of others.\"\n\nMy Dao is like a single hair—who could clearly distinguish it?\n\nLi says: Without innate wisdom within and lacking a skillful teacher without, they cannot even distinguish a hair, let alone know the origin of the great Dao. Without study, how could they understand?\n\nLiu says: It speaks of its subtlety and difficulty to comprehend.\n\nFrom the beginning of past ages, the wondrous things experienced are as numerous as grains of sand and dust.\n\nXu says: *Geng* means \"to pass through.\" Since Lord Lao opened the cosmos, within the primordial chaos—vast and boundless—countless kalpas have elapsed. Records do not preserve them, and the kalpas passed through are as numerous as sand and dust, truly beyond calculation or analogy.\n\nWith every movement, a kalpa is recorded—how arduous and toilsome I consider it!\n\nXu says: *Zai* means \"year.\" Since the beginning of creation, every cycle of death and rebirth has spanned kalpas, beyond reckoning or record. I reflect on my journeys through the eight dark realms, dwelling in mountains and seas, treading through wars and fires, traversing winds and dust, teaching and transforming beings—difficult to fully recount, how arduous and toilsome it has been!\n\nMy learning is no-learning, and thus I illuminate the spontaneous.\n\nLi says: In worldly matters, the learned accumulate daily, so their learning is *learning-with-object*. In the Dao, the learned diminish daily, so their learning is *no-learning*. Learning-with-object obscures the ultimate principle; no-learning illuminates the spontaneous. Thus, to know the spontaneous is to be spontaneous not through action, and to be spontaneous without action.\n\nEarlier I urged diligent cultivation; this passage warns against clinging to learning.\n\nThe flower’s essence returns to its true form, as the stem and leaves are to the root.\n\nLiu says: Returning to life and reverting to the root—only then is its true form revealed.\n\nTo return to the Dao’s origin and head,\n\nXu says: *Origin* and *head* both mean \"beginning.\" The essence of the Dao flows from source to stream, not from stream to source. When the root unites with the Great Beginning in essence, it ultimately converges with the Eternal Dao—only then does one realize that non-action stands above all, darkly mysterious beyond mystery.\n\nLiu says: In worldly matters, one dwells in action; in the Dao, one turns toward non-action. The \"having\" is the wandering soul of life and death; the \"non-having\" is the serene and eternal.\n\nYou should be awakened by the formless; do not be bound by the formed.\n\nLi says: If one can practice the formless, the myriad wonders will naturally unfold. If one is confined to action, the mysterious gate will remain closed.\n\nLiu says: *Formless* refers to the Dao; *formed* refers to the worldly. To be bound by the Dao is the sovereign’s emancipation; to be bound by the worldly is the fetters of life and death.\n\n*End of the Collected Commentaries on the* Scripture of Western Ascension, *Fascicle Two*\n\nVariant readings:\n#1 This line in the *Imperially Commissioned Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"Thus one knows its sincerity.\"\n#2 This line in the *Imperially Commissioned Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"Should be discussed with the enlightened.\"\n#3 This line in the *Imperially Commissioned Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"Not to be heard as mere words.\"\n#4 This line in the *Imperially Commissioned Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"Heretical teachings and orthodox speech.\"\n#5 This line in the *Imperially Commissioned Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"As if receiving something.\"\n#6 \"Gamble\" (*dǔ*) should be corrected to \"behold\" (*dǔ*).\n#7 \"Thus like the sun\" is likely an error for \"Thus it is said.\"\n#8 This line in the *Imperially Commissioned Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"Also like one who finally departs.\"\n#9 This line in the *Imperially Commissioned Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"Self-proclaimed to understand its nature.\"\n#10 This line in the *Imperially Commissioned Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"Now again parted from one’s neighbor.\"\n#11 \"Unwaning\" in the *Imperially Commissioned Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"Unmournful.\"\n#12 This line in the *Imperially Commissioned Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"The kalpas passed through are like sand and dust.\"\n#13 This line in the *Imperially Commissioned Annotations of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"For the Dao, return to the origin and head.\"\n\n*Collected Commentaries on the* Scripture of Western Ascension, *Fascicle Three*\nHua Yang: Wei Chuxuan\nJu Qu: Xu Daomiao\nChong Xuan Zi\n\n**Fascicle Three of the *Collected Commentaries on the* Scripture of Western Ascension**\n**Ren Zhen Zi: Li Rong**\n**Liu Huahui (Annotations)**\n**Bi Xu Zi (Compilation)**\n\n**Chapter Ten: Repeated Admonition**\n\nThe Old Master said: I admonish you again—you must receive this with careful attention.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** The true Dao is difficult to clarify, hence the repeated admonition. One ought to examine it thoroughly and receive it with reverence.\n\nThe Dao holds non-action as supreme; virtue takes benevolence as its master.\n\n**Chong [Xuan Zi]:** The Great Void is the supreme Dao; supreme benevolence is the master of the five virtues.\n\n**Wei [Chuxuan]:** The Dao has no form—it acts through non-action and yet accomplishes all. Thus, it stands as the foremost of heaven, earth, and all beings. When things become manifest, they lose their flow; attaining the Dao restores their flow. Hence, virtue connects to the manifest. When beings fail to obtain, one bestows upon them so they may receive—thus, benevolence is proclaimed in the chapter on \"Supreme Benevolence,\" which takes virtue as its master.\n\n**Liu [Huahui]:** To grant beings existence within the void is the Dao; to nurture their nature is virtue.\n\nRites take righteousness as humility; bestowal takes kindness as friendship. Kindness takes benefit as its priority; trust takes efficacy as its foundation.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** If you wish to practice the Dao, hold non-action as supreme—for action is not the Dao. If you wish to establish virtue, take transformative compassion as its master—for harm and killing are not virtue. In cultivating the rites of bowing and turning, one must adhere to proper conduct and humility—without righteousness and humility, there are no rites. In bestowing broadly, one should elevate kindness, taking it as the bond of friendship—for without friendship in kindness, there is no bestowal. In preserving kindness, let benefit to others come first—for kindness that does not benefit others is no kindness. In treading the path of trust, let there be tangible proof—for if it is merely in name without substance, empty and ineffectual, it is not trust. One who can practice these may perfect the Dao.\n\nThe degenerate world also possesses these, though they exist to entice one another.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** The customs of the Dao and virtue are absent, while the transformations of benevolence and righteousness prevail everywhere. Yet, as customs vary between purity and turbidity, and governance wavers between success and failure, those who practice these possess all six virtues, while those who abandon them fail even in one aspect of the Dao. In this age of falsity and shallowness, they too speak of possessing the Dao and virtue, of being replete in benevolence and righteousness—but they cannot put them into true use. They feign empty conduct to deceive and lure one another, lacking genuine trust.\n\n**Liu [Huahui]:** As for the six matters above, the degenerate world also practices them—but only to seek advantage through mutual enticement, not to practice the Dao for the benefit of beings.\n\nThus, one knows the world is thin, adorning itself with embellishments to deceive one another.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** Without the substance of the Dao and virtue, they also lose the truth of benevolence and righteousness, possessing only hollow and superficial words to flatter and outshine one another.\n\n**Liu [Huahui]:** Observe their motives, examine their conduct—who can conceal the nature of their shallowness and embellishment?\n\nTheir words stand before the soaring dragon, yet their conduct lags behind the limping tortoise.\n\n**Wei [Chuxuan]:** In this degenerate world, they falsify benevolence and righteousness to seek profit, feign rites and trust to seek fame—possessing only the name without the reality. Thus, their words stand before the soaring dragon, yet their conduct lags behind the limping tortoise. They utter empty words, but their actions cannot match them.\n\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** The noble person of old spoke sparingly but acted swiftly; the petty person of today speaks hastily but acts slowly.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** Light promises and hasty words place their speech before the soaring dragon; lack of substance and scant trust leave their conduct behind the limping tortoise.\n\nBenevolence, righteousness, rites, and trust are abandoned; the Dao and virtue lie desolate, decayed, and ruined. They do not examine one another by the Dao but instead assist one another with wealth.\n\n**Wei [Chuxuan]:** They falsely claim the names of benevolence, righteousness, rites, and trust but lack their substance—hence, they are said to be abandoned. The world’s Dao has been lost for so long that it is now desolate, decayed, and ruined. *Ji* means to attain. Yet they cannot summon governance through the Dao but instead aid one another with cleverness and wealth.\n\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** *Ji* means to enlighten, to awaken; *fu* means to assist. They neglect true form, turn their backs on reality, and embrace falsity—such is the extremity of their shallowness and embellishment, reaching this state.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** *Ji* means to reach. They cannot practice virtue in coming and going, attaining one another through the Dao. Instead, they turn to wealth and goods to mutually benefit one another, their minds set on action.\n\nIt is like a reflection in a mirror—visible but not graspable. It is like an echo in a valley—how can the sound of the wind be woven together?\n\nThe false teachings of the world are like this, so long have they led astray.\n\n*Xu* [means] to gather—Li, Liu, and the Li edition all write it as \"聚.\"\n**Wei [Yuan]:** The teachings of the former sages are like reflections in a mirror, echoes in sound: they come and go with concealment and revelation, yet the mirror remains ever still; they rise and fall with the voice, yet the echo remains ever constant. The deluded world clings to the sages’ responsive traces in things, distorting them to govern the world—how could they be grasped and woven together? Thus we know their delusion has endured for so long.\n**Li [Rong]:** The forms in a mirror are truly difficult to seize; the sounds within the wind are not easily gathered. Neither sound nor form can be taken or assembled.\n\nLight promises and hollow deeds, worldly undertakings—though one knows they bring no true benefit, the shallow customs remain sunk in confusion. Thus they distance themselves [from the Dao], and so it is said their delusion has endured for so long.\n\nAmong all beings under heaven, who alone is the constant master?\nDelusion is passed on in delusion, transmitted in turn from one to another.\n**Wei [Yuan]:** All things arise naturally, without any master to make them so. Yet the deluded claim the Dao can be transmitted to others, that spontaneity can be bestowed upon them—how profoundly confused they are!\n**Liu [Xiao]** The sage levels himself with the world, flowing with things. His spirit knows no death, his form follows transformation. His teachings are left to later generations, and the deluded pass them on, delusion begetting delusion—thus they turn endlessly.\n\nFalsehood invades the true; emptiness takes on the semblance of being.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** The benighted, failing to see clearly, are entered by falsehood. Cunning deception disrupts the true, appearing as if it were the Dao.\n\nUnable to distinguish the false from the true, they pursue profit and cling to it.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** Deluded teachers, unable to discern truth from falsehood, are bound by greed and desire, chasing worldly gain without return.\n\nIf one guards the self with this, who could call it lasting?\n**Li [Rong]:** Falsehood is action; entering the true is non-action. The deluded seek the true Dao through false paths, striving for non-action through action—how could they ever attain it? To consider this attainment is like mistaking an image in empty space for true existence.\n\nClinging to the falsity of action, failing to recognize the truth of non-action—how could this be so? It is only for the sake of greed, desire, and profit that they hold to this, thus losing the true Dao of non-action.\n\nThe unchanging and upright perish as well; the blind and foolish bear their own blame.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Clinging to falsehood and losing the true, the upright perishes as well. This is the doing of the blind and foolish—whom else could they blame?\n\nIt is like fire born from wood, which in turn burns the wood to ash.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Fire arises from wood and then consumes the wood itself. Falsehood arises from the self and then destroys the self.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Sage’s Words**\n**Laozi says:** The words of the sage declare that the Dao should be observed through its patterns.\nAs if there were something that gives birth—thus it is called spontaneity.\n**Wei [Yuan]:** What pattern should the Dao be observed by? Simply through no-pattern and no-observation, spontaneously merging into obscurity. As the *Daodejing* says: \"Always without desire, observe its mystery\"—this is what is meant.\nNow, what gives birth to what is born? It is not born through being born, but is born of itself—thus we know the Dao is spontaneous.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** All that has birth arises from the Dao.\n\nThe eyes see and the heart is moved; the mouth speaks for the heart.\nThe nose serves as the passage for wind and qi—nose and mouth are the gates of wind and qi.\n**Li [Rong]:** The eyes see external forms, and the heart is moved by what lies before them. The mouth can speak words, and the nose transmits wind and qi—who causes this to be so? All arise without knowing why they are so.\n\nQi flows from the nose and mouth, which are the gates of wind and qi.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** The ears and eyes draw in sounds and sights; the nose and mouth convey wind and qi.\n\nBreath is the dwelling of life; the body’s longevity stands at the tip of breath.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** *Chuanxi* [breath] describes its hurried urgency. A dwelling is where one resides and entrusts oneself. *Li* means to abide; *duan* means the beginning. Human life is fleeting, like a white colt passing through a gap. Breath is hurried and urgent in inhalation and exhalation. When qi gathers, life arises; when qi scatters, death comes—thus qi is the dwelling where life resides. The seven-foot body, the hundred-year lifespan—life and death, departure and abiding—all depend on breath.\n\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Life depends on qi; qi depends on the body. When qi ceases, life perishes; when the body fades, qi disperses.\n\nIt is like the grains, grasses, and trees, which follow the four qi through the seasons.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Grasses and trees rely on the four qi to grow and mature; the bodily form depends on breath as the dwelling of life.\n\nWhen qi parts, the living die; when it waxes or wanes, sickness and toil arise.\n**Wei [Yuan]:** *Bie* means separation. When a person is completely separated from qi, they die. If qi increases or decreases, there is the suffering of sickness and emaciation.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** The four qi have their flourishing and decline; the four seasons have their succession. Thus the hundred grains, grasses, and trees have their growth, maturity, withering, and decay—following their departure, they die; following their arrival, they live. It is like a person, who arises from the four great elements: when the four conditions separate, they die; when the four conditions harmonize, they live. When yang converges, it increases and flourishes; when yin converges, it declines and weakens—thus arise emaciation, illness, toil, suffering, aging, sickness, and death.\n\nSince life and death exist through this, it is better to be at peace in non-action.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Action and desire lead to the flux of life and death; non-action and desirelessness remain constantly at peace, unmoving.\n\nIn non-action, nothing is done—how could there be faults or transgressions?\n**Wei [Yuan]:** The non-active has no doing, no stopping, no going, no coming, no life, no death. Transformations unfold boundlessly—abiding in fate, how could faults or transgressions arise?\n\nDo not covet the body’s form; do not become an enemy to action.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** Indulging in the pleasures of the body, pampering one’s life and nourishment, yielding to the six senses’ desires, following the three karmas’ deeds—action and affairs give rise to the enmity of life and death.\nIf one knows the body is not one’s own, that life is a temporary harmony, and does not overindulge in nurturing or breathing, then what enmity or harm could there be?\n\nWithout constancy, the upright perish as well; the blind and foolish cling to self-blame.\nIt is like fire born from wood, which in turn burns the wood to rot.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Fire arises from wood and then burns the wood itself. Falsehood arises from the self and then destroys the self.\n\nThe Five Phases do not overcome one another, and the myriad things may all be preserved whole.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** The seven-foot body contains all Five Phases. When action exceeds its proper measure, opposition and compliance contend. If one abandons external cleverness and entrusts the form to its own governance, each fulfilling its role, yin and yang proceeding in order without encroaching or overcoming, then the hundred parts of the body remain complete.\n\nThe myriad things have no constancy; what is completed does not long endure.\nThe Three Luminaries are not dim, yet Heaven and Earth remain ever radiant.\n**Wei [Daomiao]:** Where there is completion, there is destruction; without completion, there is no destruction—this is the constant Dao of nature. Thus the sage, though accomplished, does not cling to completion, and so remains ever accomplished. Heaven and Earth are without intent, and thus ever radiant; the Three Luminaries are without intent, and thus never dim; the sage is without intent, and thus ever accomplished.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Observing the Myriad [Things]**\n**Laozi:** Observe the myriad [things] to cultivate the Dao; preserve the spirit in contemplation and thought.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** The Dao of practice has many methods, and the paths of self-cultivation are not singular. Though the transforming Dao has been expounded before, lest the deluded remain unturned, now observe the disciples who study the Dao and the stages of its cultivation. To attain long life and immortality, one must only preserve the spirit and contemplate the Dao. When wisdom unites with the Dao and the spirit is preserved, spirit and form become one. When spirit and form are one, one naturally enters the realm of purity and emptiness. When wisdom unites with the Dao, one silently returns to the source of wisdom. The wondrous fruit is thus achieved—this is the Dao.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Observe the stages of the mind to prevent chaotic thoughts from arising, and contemplate the essential Dao.\n\nThe qi of the Dao and the Three Luminaries—contemplate what governs within the body.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** The *qi* of the Dao refers to guiding and harmonizing; the Three Luminaries are the Three Ones, the spirits within the body. In cultivating the body, one must guide and harmonize the *qi* to attain suppleness, preserve the Three and guard the One, so the One never leaves the body—thus one will naturally attain the Dao. The Three Ones reside within the three palaces of the human body. If one’s contemplation remains unscattered, the spirits will naturally descend. When the spirits descend, the true Dao is accomplished.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Illumine within and radiate without; the *qi* of Heaven and Earth commune. Calm the spirit and purify the mind, so the guiding principles remain undispersed.\n\nDimly, as in dreams or waking visions, the numinous spirits suddenly come and go.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** If one contemplates the Dao, the Dao will naturally return to them. If one knows how to preserve the spirit, the spirits will naturally descend. Forgetting emotions and thoughts, as in dreams or waking, the spirits descend in indistinct forms, and the true is attained in the formless. The spirits move without obstruction, coming and going without hindrance.\n\nSerene and detached, the will abides in non-action; yet in contemplation and thought, there remains intent.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** *Dàn* should read *chuàng*: tasteless and desolate, empty and still, non-active. The will is set on contemplating the mysterious and preserving the true, wandering freely without affairs. Yet one has not yet reduced the heart to ashes or withered the form; emotions and attachments remain, along with thoughts of pursuit and desires for indulgence.\n\nOne claims to be settled in desirelessness, unaware that holding to contemplation is different.\n**Wei [Daomiao]:** Next, one should relinquish the mind that preserves the spirit. Serene and detached, the will abides in non-action—yet this contemplation of the spirit still involves form and intent. Thus one must further relinquish it to settle in desirelessness, forgetting even the thoughts of contemplation. Hence one does not realize the difference between holding the mind and contemplating the spirit.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** Those who preserve the spirit claim to have calmed the mind and settled the intent, free from the passions of attachment. Yet they do not realize that the spirit harbors thoughts and desires. Though they uphold precepts and close off emptiness, wayward thoughts and imaginings arise unawares.\n\nAt times, the *qi* is still coarse and vigorous; one knows one’s affairs are still many.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** *Yíng* should read *cū*. The learner has not yet weakened the will or refined conduct, nor harmonized and preserved the spirit. At times, the intent and *qi* remain strong and unyielding, favoring coarseness and vigor—coarseness and vigor being the methods of action, which conflict with serenity and detachment. Thus one knows one’s pursuits are excessive and full of strife.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** New thoughts and differing intentions arise subtly at first. Accumulated thoughts grow great; multiplied intentions become many. Entangled in action, confusion deepens—this confusion is still coarse and vigorous. In the world of human affairs, the ten thousand conditions arise; the six senses are bound, and wherever they touch, they become stained. Thus it is called \"many affairs.\" When affairs arise, the form moves; when it moves, it connects outwardly with schemes. When things and affairs flourish, the body is set in motion; when the body is agitated, the mind’s wisdom turns outward, deliberating on gains and losses.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** When external affairs arise, the inner mind is also stirred. Mind and affairs unite, together plotting action—thus it is called \"connecting with schemes.\"\n\nScheming and thinking are the beginning of danger; what is dangerous will not long endure.\nWhat does not endure will soon decline; what declines will not long live.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** Unable to inwardly contemplate the spirit and instead employing wisdom in outward schemes, deliberations multiply, the spirit labors, and the will is lost—this is the cause of harming one’s nature and the beginning of peril. The onset of danger means one will not long endure and will soon suffer decline. When the form is worn externally and the spirit labored within, both inner and outer are harmed. One will soon perish; decline leads to the spirit’s forgetfulness and the *qi*’s dispersal—thus one will not long enjoy life or preserve existence.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** Without thought or deliberation, there is peace; with plotting and scheming, there is danger. Peace brings long endurance; danger does not endure. What does not endure is cut short—thus it is called \"not long-lived.\"\n\nViewing fame and reputation through the body, the affairs of things are difficult to gather.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** The body is internal; fame is external. The inner body is but an empty illusion; external fame is but a fleeting flower. Observing thus, the body cannot long endure, nor can things long be gathered. Why? This single body clings to the ten thousand conditions, all desiring to gather before it—fame, sensual pleasures, profit, and desire, all amassed in one body. Beware of entanglements; do not allow them to stain.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** The affairs of things refer to wealth and property. The body is the vessel of the Dao; fame is the thief of the body. Thus when fame is established, the body fails; when the body is at peace, the Dao flourishes. Observing thus, fame and wealth are difficult to accumulate.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** When the body perishes for fame, how can things be gathered? For those who spread their name and reputation, they are inevitably led astray by these very things.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Those who indulge desires, pursue fame, and chase profit—who fix their minds on sensual pleasures and extravagance—how could they ever see this as wrong? Thus, it is said: they are ensnared by what their feet pursue.\n\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** To act for the sake of lofty reputation, praise, titles, and honor is to make profit the heart’s intent. Once profit becomes the heart’s intent, one is led astray by the lure of fame and gain.\n\nAll this stems from greed; greed is the source of calamity and fault.\n\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** *Zuò* (坐) means the cause of transgression; *yāng* (殃), disaster; *jiù* (咎), fault. Those who prize reputation do so because of insatiable greed, thereby inviting calamity and fault across the three lifetimes.\n\n**Li [Shaowei]:** The gluttonous and avaricious—none fail to bring disaster upon themselves through their abandonment of the Dao.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Among the three thousand offenses under the five punishments, all stem from greed leading to punishment. No just governance or upright law exists where greed is not the greatest disaster. Why then do people not guard against it?\n\nGreed is a grave affliction, cultivated over a long time.\n\nIts convergence is subtle and gradual, not something moxibustion or acupuncture can cure.\n\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** Greed is the foremost of the three poisons, the great illness of birth and death. It arises from lifelong habits of craving accumulated over past lives, hence \"long-standing.\" *Zī* (滋) means to increase. *Yù* (愈) should read *yù* (瘉), meaning to heal an illness. As greed takes root in the heart over time, its subtle coalescence grows imperceptibly, like a disease of the vital organs—beyond the reach of moxibustion or acupuncture.\n\n**Li [Shaowei]:** Greed can destroy the body, hence it is a grave affliction. Its habitual nature makes it long-standing. It grows subtly, advancing gradually, from faint to manifest, from small to great. When it festers within, the illness reaches the vital organs, making it difficult to remove—beyond the cure of moxibustion or acupuncture.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Once deeply rooted, it spreads through all things. The affliction has no form, so how could moxibustion or acupuncture treat it?\n\nReturn to what the mind desires, abide in purity, and guard the self.\n\n**Li [Shaowei]:**\n\nGreed is the gravest affliction, one that no remedy can remove. If one now wishes to eradicate it, by what Dao should it be done? Simply by being without desire, and the harm will naturally dissolve. If one can forget the self, then the injury will depart. Only in purity, only in stillness, guarding the Dao and preserving the True—sitting upright in non-action, one becomes serene and severs all entanglements.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** The teeming return to their root; those who restore their mandate guard themselves.\n\nThe conduct of the Great Sage does not emulate what others esteem.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** *Mu* (慕) means \"to esteem.\" The Sage esteems emptiness and stillness, free from striving, while ordinary people esteem fame and profit, bound by desire. The True and the vulgar stand in opposition; their choices differ, so the Sage does not esteem what ordinary people hold dear.\n\n**Li [Shaowei]:** The path trodden by petty persons directs their ears and eyes toward sounds and sights, their hearts and minds toward greed and craving. They take this as their affliction, failing to attain the Dao. The Great Sage practices clarity and emptiness, free from desire, the heart not fixed on action—thus free from the burdens of worldly concerns.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** When self and other are both forgotten, how could one seek to be esteemed?\n\nWhat is constant can be made to cease; what is inconstant can be made to endure.\n\n**Wei [Boyang]:** I was originally without form, then suddenly came to be. By constantly forgetting this embodied self, one returns to the state before birth—this is how the constant can be made inconstant. Not taking life as life, one remains perpetually alive and undying—this is how the inconstant can be made constant.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** Those who lose the Dao make the constant cease; those who attain the Dao make the inconstant endure. Thus *Zhuangzi* says: \"How do we know what I call Heaven is not what others call Man? How do we know what I call Man is not what others call Heaven?\" This is what it means.\n\n**Li [Zhen]:** What the common people admire is but the pursuit of fame and profit, the gratification of desires—all rooted in *having*, never willing to embrace *non-being*. The sage, however, inwardly discards the mind’s discriminations and outwardly severs the bonds of reputation. Neither *having* nor *non-having*, yet capable of *non-having* and *having*; not *having* yet able to *have*—this is how *having* may be returned to *non-having*. Not *non-having* yet *non-having*—this is how *non-having* may be returned to *having*. When *non-having* returns to *having*, nothing fails to take form; when *having* returns to *non-having*, nothing is ever destroyed. Now hidden, now manifest, transformation proceeds with effortless mastery.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: The Scripture’s Admonitions**\n**Laozi:** What the scripture admonishes accords with the principles of the Dao.\n\nWhat blazes in glory is not as wondrous as the subtly profound.\n\n**Li [Zhen]:** Examining the scripture’s admonitions and deducing their principles, we see that those of lofty rank and resplendent houses—once favor reaches its peak, disgrace follows; where joy departs, sorrow gathers. They are ever bound to gain and loss, rise and decline. Better to embrace the Dao and dwell in contentment, preserving authenticity and discerning the good. In retreat, one avoids withering; in advancement, one shuns ostentation. Roaming freely among the trees and groves, wandering at ease in the marketplace—this is to preserve the subtly profound and the uncarved simplicity.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** What blazes in glory perishes; what is subtly profound endures. Pursuing this principle to its end, one inevitably arrives here.\n\nReality is not as good as emptiness; multiplicity is not as good as rarity.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** When the mind is truly without delusion, it attains wondrous emptiness. When affairs are tangled and numerous, they breed corruption—thus they are not as good as rarity.\n\nLush abundance meets early death; swiftness is not as good as slowness.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** *Swiftness* means haste. Whether heterodox teachings or orthodox words, all respond to nature. Thus, practicing ritual methods may yield quick results, and supplications to ghosts and spirits often bring swift verification. Cultivating the true Dao, however, yields slow and difficult progress—but once achieved, it is free from failure, leading to the state beyond death and life. Studying heterodox texts brings quick success but also quick ruin, leaving one trapped in the cycle of birth and death. Thus, the heterodox is not as good as the orthodox, and swiftness is not as good as slowness.\n\nWhat rises must fall; what flourishes must decline.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** This is true of all things, not only human affairs.\n\nThe sage severs cunning and acts through *non-action*.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** Severing perverse cunning, abandoning *having*, illuminating true wisdom, and acting through *non-action*.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Severing cunning eliminates rise and flourishing; *non-action* eliminates decline and decay.\n\nSpeaking without speaking, acting without acting.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** Speaking of the principle of *non-speaking*—what is there to say? Acting in the realm of *non-action*—what is there to do?\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Abiding in darkness and following things, wandering with the Dao, one loses all companionship and forgets all cares—where then can action be lodged?\n\nWho can comprehend this? The even is not as good as the odd.\n\n**Wei [Boyang]:** The Dao is originally wordless, yet responds to things with words—thus it speaks without speaking. The Dao is originally actionless, yet responds to things with action—thus it acts without acting. *Even* means two; *odd* means one. Those who understand *non-speaking* and *non-action* must reduce two to one to approach the Dao.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** The body pairs with the spirit; desires pair with the body. Those who labor their forms do so to nourish their bodies; those who lose themselves do so through excessive desires. Thus, those who forget the body attain spiritual stillness; those who abandon desires attain bodily peace. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Those who nurture the will forget the form; those who nurture the form forget profit; those who attain the Dao forget the mind.\"\n\nAbundance is not as good as scarcity—who is wise enough to follow?\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** *Scarcity* means few; *follow* means to comply. Broad learning and wide observation of many schools are not as good as focusing on the essence of the Dao, embracing the One and guarding the mysterious. Thus it is said: \"Abundance brings confusion; scarcity brings attainment.\" Who claims that benevolence, righteousness, integrity, and health make one worthy and good? Yet pursuing fame erodes virtue, giving rise to hypocrisy and shallowness, making it difficult to return to virtue and the Dao. Thus, benevolence can be practiced, righteousness can be compromised, and ritual is but pretense. Who is truly benevolent is hard to find; few rely on righteousness.\n\n**Li [Zhen]:** The practice of *non-action* is difficult to perform; the mind of *non-duality* is rarely awakened. Which worthy or benevolent person can follow their heart’s truth in action? Even benevolence and worthiness are hard to attain—how much more so for the deluded, who find it no easy task. Thus, few can truly rely on the profound and wondrous principles.\n\nTo know *non-knowing* is the pivot of the Dao.\n\n**Li [Zhen]:** If one can follow the teaching of *non-speaking* and rely on the principle of *non-action*, one naturally awakens to the Dao. Though wisdom knows all, it is as if it knows nothing. By forgetting knowledge, one grasps the pivot of the Dao. Here, \"attainment\" means gaining the Dao’s essential wonder.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** The Dao takes *non-knowing* as its foundation. Those who embody it attain its pivot and essence.\n\nEmptiness extinguished into nothingness—what need is there for immortal flight?\n\n**Xu, Li, and Liu’s versions read: \"Emptiness and extinction into nothingness—what need is there for immortal flight?\"**\n\n**Wei [Boyang]:** Abandoning the seven virtues of the great sage and returning to the true essence of benevolence and righteousness is the gradual path to the Dao. The *pivot* is the essential; the *mechanism* is the subtle movement that foreshadows fortune. Having drawn near to the Dao, one understands that the Dao is *non-knowing*—this is the mechanism and essence of the Dao. Yet the Dao’s essence cannot be sought with intention, so one must further reduce the mechanism to emptiness, and emptiness to nothingness—only then can one attain immortal flight. *Immortality* is the name for that which is beyond life and death. The true person comprehends past and present, equals transformation, shares the same body with the myriad things, and is born together with creation. Thus, there is no time when they do not live, no place where they cannot be. Riding emptiness and treading the void, piercing metal and stone—what difficulty is there in this?\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** The spiritual person guards essence and returns to the true, achieving emptiness and extinction into nothingness. The immortal nurtures spirit and attains long life, ascending to heaven with form. Having form is not as good as being formless—thus, what need is there for immortal flight?\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Departing or remaining, leaving the form, following change and submitting to transformation—vast and timeless, what need is there for immortal flight?\n\nThe great Dao is vast and boundless, yet nothing is beyond its control.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** The great Dao is lofty and distant, vast and boundless. It nurtures the myriad things, governs with spirit, and encompasses heaven and earth. Through *non-action*, it achieves all things.\n\n**Li [Daochun]:** Profound and distant—thus it is called \"vast.\" Level and even—thus it is called \"boundless.\" Governing and guiding all things—thus it is called \"control.\" Encompassing the ten thousand existences—thus it is called \"enclosure.\" Should you come to understand this, what you return to is not [what you once knew].\n\n**Li [Daochun]:** Should you come to understand the great Dao, the supreme principle will be thoroughly penetrated, and the dusty burdens of the vast and boundless will all grow cold. Then you will know that the narrow views of the past, the common affections of former days—what was deemed good was not truly good, what was deemed right was not truly right.\n\nThe scripture says: \"Examine carefully—who can follow?\" **Li [Daochun]:** \"Examine carefully\" means \"truly real.\" With an even mind, one illuminates the path of stillness; with an empty self, one reaches the source of the Dao. Extinguish hearing and seeing at their pivot, sever right and wrong in the boundless—this is the teaching of the mysterious and wondrous, the words of truth. Yet those lost in the world, chasing desires, are many; those who forget the passions are few. Who can follow?\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** The Dao severs thoughts and cares, its principle transcends words and images. Its hidden and manifest workings differ greatly—how could this be known by those of shallow understanding?\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Profound and Wondrous**\n\n**Laozi:** The words of the Dao are profound and wondrous; the scriptures and precepts are subtle and hidden. Heaven and earth, the myriad things—all life arises from the One.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; the ten thousand things attain the One and come to life. Thus it is said: all life arises from the One.\n\n**Li [Daochun]:** To cut off thoughts is \"profound\"; to be unfathomable is \"wondrous.\" The One is the mysterious; \"hidden\" is the subtle. The scriptural teachings are deep and distant; the precepts and disciplines are dark and minute. The words spoken are utterly secluded and obscure—yet all declare that heaven, earth, and the myriad things arise from the Dao. This is trustworthy and verifiable.\n\nShould you come to understand this, you will know the real and the illusory. **Li [Daochun]:** To understand is to grasp that the One is the root of things. To know that things arise from the One is real; to speak of what does not arise from the One is illusory.\n\nShould you fail to perceive it, even when shown, you will not distinguish it. **Li [Daochun]:** Were I not to explain it to you, even if you could not perceive it clearly, though I made it manifest, you would still be unable to discern it.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** If the mind is dim and dull, even when things are made manifest, they will not be distinguished.\n\nShould your will cling to being, non-action will be afflicted. **Xu [Gongzu]:** \"Afflicted\" means diseased. Being is the disease of non-action—this urges one to abandon being and return to non-being.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Stillness detests disorder; simplicity abhors complication. Having being is what non-action finds afflicting.\n\nTo be entangled in being is to remain bound for countless eons without end. **Li [Daochun]:** If your will rests in non-action, you will suddenly realize the Dao. If you harbor desires, you will be entangled for a thousand myriad eons, bound by having being, with no way to bring it to completion.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Grasping at this and chasing after that, fettered in chains, the flow of love and attachment—when will it ever end?\n\nThe words of the Dao are subtle and deep; you have yet to distinguish them. Grasp the essentials in brief—truly, be careful not to lose them.\n\n**Wei [Boyang]:** Since you have yet to distinguish the subtle, deep, wondrous, and distant purport of the Dao’s words, you may at least gather the rough and simple truthful words—do not let your mind grow lax.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** The myriad wonders are hard to understand; gather the essential precepts. Preserve virtue and guard the real; follow the precepts and do not lose them.\n\n**Li [Daochun]:** The dark chapters and secret classics cannot be fully expounded. Select and take the essentials; only then should you follow the scriptural precepts. Abandon evil and follow good; exit being and enter non-being. Practice this from beginning to end without fail—this is what it means to comprehend the scriptures.\n\nFirst reduce your desires; do not let the mind wander. **Xu [Gongzu]:** Uphold the precepts and restrain the passions. First reduce desires and block the gates—then the dusty realms will not enter. Close the doors, and the mind and will shall not wander.\n\nDwell in leisure, abide in stillness, refine your thoughts in a purified chamber. **Li [Daochun]:** To be without affairs is to dwell in leisure; to settle the mind is to abide in stillness. To concentrate the emotions is to refine thoughts daily; to cleanse the mind is called a purified chamber.\n\nTen thousand scrolls of alchemical texts are not equal to guarding the One. **Xu [Gongzu]:** Refining the eight stones, revolving the furnace of the nine elixirs, ingesting the knife-point’s measure—one ascends to the pure heavens. Though this is wondrous and divine, it remains but a method and technique. How could it compare to the inner dharma of the original One, the true root of the correct nature? Guard it without losing it, and you will merge with heaven—thus it is said: ten thousand scrolls of alchemical texts are not equal to guarding the One.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** In the Dao, daily reduction is practiced, not relying on elaborate texts. Simply guard the One, and the Dao will naturally be attained.\n\nThe scriptures are not obscure, yet in the end, there is the real and the illusory. Words of being must lead to non-being—you have yet to distinguish this. Words of non-being must lead to being—you have yet to comprehend this.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** Though the scriptures are concise, their principles are not obscure. Worldly teachings are false and illusory; Daoist texts are true and real. Within the real, there is the real—thus being does not definitively remain being but returns to non-being. Non-being does not definitively remain non-being but reverts to generate being. Being and non-being give rise to one another, never having a fixed beginning. You, Master Yin, are still learning and cannot yet distinguish this.\n\n**Li [Daochun]:** The above speaks of the real and the illusory—does this not refer to this? Words of non-being necessarily lead to being—this is the illusory becoming real. Words of being necessarily lead to non-being—this is the real becoming illusory. That the real becomes illusory—you have yet to distinguish this. That the illusory becomes real—you have yet to comprehend this. To comprehend, to distinguish, to know the real and the illusory—once you penetrate the scriptures, you will naturally preserve the Dao.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Principles have their flow and change; words have their restraint and elevation. Those who grasp the text lose its truth; those who cling to the teaching stray from its essence. Subtle words are hidden and obscure—dissecting them is truly difficult. Only when inner understanding is achieved can the mysterious be fully realized.\n\nSimply follow and practice, extinguishing each as it arises. **Li [Daochun]:** Simply rely on and follow the scriptural methods. First abandon evil, then forget good. First break having desires, then extinguish non-action. Forget both having being and non-action; obliterate both good and evil. As thoughts arise, extinguish them one by one.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Since you cannot yet clearly understand the profound purport, simply follow the teachings and practice step by step. Do not pursue thoughts or generate distinctions upon hearing or seeing.\n\nThe Dao has truth and falsehood; fortune has auspiciousness and iniquity. **Liu [Zijing]:** Those who deviate from the宗 are false; those who accord with principle are true. What arises from non-action is auspicious; what arises from action is iniquitous. Thus the *Virtue Classic* says: \"Fortune, oh!—wherein misfortune lies concealed.\"\n\nTransgressions may be public or private; the enlightened discern even the most minute. **Liu [Zijing]:** To practice the Dao is public; to follow the mundane is private. Those who cultivate the Dao, failing to align with the mysterious宗, still harbor emotions and conduct. In responding to things, they err and act inappropriately, sometimes contravening the Way. Yet if their hearts remain unselfish, their aspiration fixed on aiding others, their sincerity in the Dao profound, their principles distinct from private concerns, and their righteousness rooted in inner sincerity, their faults may be excused. \"Minute\" here means exceedingly fine.\n\nTo divine the past and foreknow the future is not as good as simplicity and genuineness. **Li [Daochun]:** To comprehend the past is to divine it; to understand the future is to foreknow it. Though one may possess wisdom, knowing all from beginning to end, one often fails and stumbles. Only by preserving simplicity and fostering genuine integrity can one establish oneself, serve one’s lord, nourish one’s parents, and accomplish the Dao in both action and cultivation. **Liu [Zijing]:** Excessive foresight breeds worry; foreknowledge invites near disgrace. Abandon sagacity, cast aside cunning, and dwell in pure simplicity.\n\n*Collected Commentaries on the* Western Ascension Classic*, Scroll Three, Concluded*\n\n*Variant Notes:*\n1. \"言处\" in this edition; \"言出\" in the *Imperially Commissioned Annotations of the Zhenghe Era*.\n2.

The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the myriad things.\n*(Xu, Li, and Liu’s editions all read: \"The Dao gives birth to Heaven; Heaven gives birth to Earth; Earth gives birth to the myriad things.\")*\n\nWei [Chuxuan] said: \"Void and Nothingness\" means there is no thing. \"Spontaneity\" also means there is no thing. It borrows \"Void and Nothingness\" to give birth to spontaneity, and borrows spontaneity to give birth to the Dao—all to clarify its spontaneity. The \"One\" is the function of the Dao. Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things all arise from the Dao; none can depart from it. It is also called the One. The One spreads qi, and the Two Modes (Heaven and Earth) divide from it. Thus it is said, \"The One gives birth to the Two.\" The myriad things are all born from the commingling qi of Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said, \"Heaven and Earth give birth to the myriad things.\"\n\nLi [Rong] said: This refers to things with form, which arise in succession from above to below.\n\nLiu [Renhui] said: Tracing the origin of birth leads to Void and Nothingness. This is a progression of names and principles, yet in truth, one does not know *how* it is so.\n\nThe myriad things embrace the One and attain completion, receiving the subtle and wondrous transformations of qi.\n*(Li’s edition reads: \"transformations of birth.\")*\n\nWei said: Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are all transformed and born from the subtle and wondrous qi of the One.\n\nXu [Daomiao] said: The Two Modes and the myriad things are all completed by the One. Only humans receive the subtle and wondrous qi, and thus possess the ability for numinous transformation.\n\nLi said: Heaven, Earth, and all beings embrace the true Dao of the One. Receiving the subtle and wondrous qi, they are thus able to transform and be born. From this, we know that the qi of the One is the root of the myriad things.\n\nHumans possess the treasure of longevity, yet cannot preserve it. Instead, they seek to augment honor and glory—this is called abandoning the root. It is the Way of generating Heaven and Earth.\n\nXu said: The treasure of longevity is the One. Humans cannot embrace the subtle and wondrous qi, nor preserve the One to attain long life. They fail to safeguard what is truly precious, instead cherishing what others value, increasing their desires, and coveting honor and glory. This is called abandoning the root. The true treasure is the correct Way of the Two Modes.\n\nLiu said: The treasure of longevity refers to the true nature. Those who seek to augment honor and glory lose their original, life-giving nature.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Vast and Indistinct**\n\nMaster Laozi said: The vast and indistinct are the root of the Dao. The myriad things share a common origin; the Dao is their source.\n\nLi said: The ultimate root is empty and still, called Void and Nothingness. Yet Void and Nothingness are not mere emptiness and stillness—their being and non-being are indeterminate, thus they are called \"vast and indistinct.\" Since Void and Nothingness give birth to spontaneity, and spontaneity gives birth to the Dao, we know that Void and Nothingness are the root of the Dao. The myriad things all attain life through the Dao, and thus we know the Dao is the original source of things.\n\nIf one does not forget it within oneself, I alone remain silent.\n*(Wei’s edition reads: \"different.\")*\n\nWei said: All the myriad things share the same origin with the Dao, yet they constantly drift and flow, unable to align with the Dao. Thus they are caught in the waves of life and death. If one can preserve the Dao within oneself, one’s life will never perish. The multitude cannot preserve the Dao; only I alone can do so. Thus I am different from the multitude.\n\nLi said: The Dao is the source of things; qi is the root of life. To lose the Dao is to die; to forfeit qi is to perish. If one does not perish, the sage remains silent and does not speak. Now, expounding the profound words and broadly disseminating the wondrous teachings is to instruct others in nurturing qi and embracing the Dao, returning to the root. If one can draw qi inward and hold the Dao in the heart, neither water nor fire can bring disaster, nor can life and death cause harm. Abiding long in the Dao, one sits upright and attains perfection. Grasping the meaning, one forgets words—thus it is called \"silence.\" To know yet not remain silent is to lose it.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Generation and Placement**\n\nMaster Laozi said: It generated me in the Void; it placed me in Nothingness.\n\nXu said: \"Placed\" means established. The harmonious qi of the Void transformed and gave birth to my form. The numinous and formless established my spirit.\n\nLiu said: The real does not give birth to the real; what gives birth to the real is the Void. The existent does not contain the existent; what contains the existent is Nothingness.\n\nWhat gives me life is spirit; what destroys me is the heart.\n\nWei said: \"Gives life\" means preserves. What allows me to live long is that my heart is one with the Void. What allows me to endure is that my form is one with Nothingness. Spirit has no form or sign, thus it gives me life. The heart has attachments, thus it destroys me.\n\nLi said: The form does not generate itself; it is born only when it attains spirit. The body does not destroy itself; it is killed by the heart. If the heart does not commit evil, one can long endure.\n\nThe heart and its intentions are my affliction. If I have no heart, what can I know?\n\nWei said: To have a heart and intentions is to have attachments, which obstruct life. If I have no heart, then I have no knowledge—what obstruction could there be?\n\nLi said: The heart possesses discriminating knowledge, capable of creating the transgressions of deliberate action. Transgressions become obstructions to me—this truly arises from the heart. If one forgets the heart and has no knowledge, one will naturally be without affliction.\n\nI reflect on the time before I was born: I had no body. It was merely the accumulation of qi and the gathering of blood that formed my body.\n\nWei said: This is the method of relinquishing form and preserving spirit.\n\nXu said: I lament having a body and sigh deeply, longing for the time before I was born, when I had no body and no burdens. Yet qi and blood accumulated to form this fleshly body, a borrowed and insufficient existence. Humans value and cherish it, only increasing their burdens and obstructions.\n\nMy body is the chariot of spirit, the dwelling of spirit, the master of spirit.\n\nXu said: As a horse drives a chariot, so spirit carries the form. Spirit resides in the human body as a person dwells in a house. When the house is whole, the person is at peace; when the body is healthy, spirit is joyful. Thus the wise preserve the body to nurture spirit, moving the form to ascend as an immortal.\n\nLi said: The body can carry spirit, and spirit can ride upon a person—hence it is called a chariot. The body can contain spirit, and spirit regards the body as its dwelling—hence it is called a house. Coming from without to lodge within the body, it is thus called the master. When the master is tranquil, spirit abides within; when restless and agitated, spirit departs.\n\nXu said: When the bodily form is still, spirit rests in its palaces. When restless and active, spirit leaves its dwelling. The word \"immediately\" signifies swift response.\n\nLi said: Only when the chariot is sturdy can it carry things; only when the house is tranquil can it shelter people. If the master is noisy and disorderly, how can the guest remain long? One must firmly guard the body so that spirit may ride upon it, purify the heart so that spirit may rectify it, and maintain inner and outer stillness so that spirit may dwell within. If the body is defiled and the heart and belly are restless, spirit will depart—hence it is said to leave.\n\nLiu said: When spirit resides, there is life; when spirit departs, there is death. Life arises from stillness; death comes from restlessness and peril. Therefore, the sage has no constant heart, desiring to return to the original beginning, to revert to the state before birth.\n\nLi said: Attachment, defilement, and the agitation of worldly striving—these are the hearts of ordinary people. The sage, pure and desireless, has no such constant worldly heart. Those with a heart chase after the superficial and enter the cycle of life and death; those without a heart return to the root and merge with the true Dao, no longer subject to life and death.\n\nLiu said: Utterly still, without anything. Before a person is born, how can there be a body? Without a body, what is there to worry about? What is there to desire?\n\nWei said: Desire and worry both arise from cherishing the body and overvaluing life. If one returns to the state before birth, how can there be a body? What worry or burden can there be?\n\nLi said: Only after birth does one have form; before birth, there is no body in principle. With a body, a hundred worries arise and the five desires contend; without a body, all burdens are cast off and a thousand sorrows vanish. Even the burdens of having a body are gone—how can there be disasters beyond the body? Thus, to set the body aside and preserve spirit is to retain luminous essence. When virtue and the Dao unite, one communicates with the Dao.\n\nWei said: Luminous essence is spirit and clarity. To set the body aside means that luminous essence does not leave the form. When essence constantly remains, virtue and the Dao naturally unite as one, and when they unite as one, the Dao becomes fully realized.\n\nXu said: To distance oneself from the transient form and cherish the spirit that gives life, one must empty the heart and still the body, preserve spirit and maintain simplicity. Then the mysterious essence shines brightly, abiding in its chambers, uniting with the Dao as one—this is called the body without a body.\n\nLi said: Those who strive for worldly life and those who study the Dao must forget the body externally, not indulge in rich flavors, and first inwardly preserve spirit, directing their will toward the Dao. In the realm of the indistinct and subtle, wisdom naturally returns; radiant essence shines brightly, illuminating all without exception—hence it is called \"luminous essence remains.\" When wisdom comes to rest, virtue and the Dao unite as one, equalizing without partiality, harmonizing with emptiness and communication—hence it is said to \"communicate with the Dao.\"\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: On Practicing the Dao**\n\nLaozi said: Those who practiced the Dao in ancient times all followed nature.\n\nLi said: The practitioners of the Dao in ancient times all acted naturally. With virtue pure and desireless, they needed no teacher’s instruction to cultivate the Dao naturally—there were none who did not follow nature. If one forces it, it will not be so. Thus, the Dao is naturally so; to force it is not so.\n\nLiu said: It is not done with intention; to force it is to act with intention—hence it is not so.\n\nLi said: To concentrate the mind and unite with the Dao, to be desireless and preserve the true, to practice with constancy—this is to attain the Dao of nature. If one does not establish conduct externally or cultivate the heart internally but forces oneself to act, the Dao will never be attained. Why is this? Because thoughts and intentions oppose the Dao.\n\nLiu said: Why is it not so? The Dao has no thoughts or intentions; those with a heart contradict it. Thus, the instrument of *chong* and *yue* depends on its user.\n\nXu said: The *yue* has six holes like a flute and is a musical instrument. The instrument is empty and hollow, depending on the user—just as the sage is empty and without intention, responding to all stimuli, depending on circumstances to act and adapt. Emptiness and fullness, being and non-being, square and round, large and small, long and short, wide and narrow—all depend on the user and do not contend with others.\n\nLi said: *Chong* means to expel, and *yue* is a flute. The *chong* emits qi, and the *yue* produces sound—both are without intention, subject to human manipulation. The size of the qi, the length of the sound, whether square or round, broad or narrow—all follow human creation and do not contend with others. This is an analogy.\n\nLiu said: Without intention to seek use, there is no contention.\n\nWhen a good person is in the world, it is like the *chong* and *yue*—not contending with the myriad things, their virtue always returns to them.\n\nLiu said: Responding to things is all; the beauty of sound and qi always returns to the *chong* and *yue*. The virtue of non-action always returns to the sage. This is because they are empty, hollow, and desireless.\n\nWei said: Heaven, without intention, follows things, allowing all things to fulfill their natures. The world returns to it as its lord.\n\nLi said: This completes the analogy. The virtuous noble, establishing virtue and refining others, externally does not contend with things, and internally is desireless and humble. Virtue naturally returns to them, and the Dao resides within.\n\nDesire is the root of misfortune and harm; non-desire is the origin of heaven and earth. None know its root; none know its origin.\n\nLi said: Desire harms the body—hence it is the root of misfortune and harm. Non-desire unites with the Dao—hence it is the origin of heaven and earth. Yet deluded emotions confuse and obscure understanding, leaving people ignorant of desire as the root of misfortune and non-desire as the source of blessing. Thus, they are enlightened.\n\nThe sage eliminates desire to enter non-desire, thereby aiding their person.\n\nLi said: Externally relinquishing covetous desires, guarding the self through non-action—only the sage can achieve this. With the Dao as their support and wings, they may endure long. If one follows the common flow, they cannot avoid misfortune and harm. Yet the great sage knows neither peril nor safety, neither defilement nor purity. Now, speaking of eliminating desire to enter non-desire is to instruct the deluded masses in proper conduct. Those who follow the sagely way may attain the Dao.\n\nLiu said: Not eliminating desire is not the way to aid the self.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Sounds and Colors**\nLaozi said: All people take sounds, colors, and rich flavors as joy, yet they do not know that sounds, colors, and rich flavors are the great unhewn of misfortune.\n\nLi said: Ordinary people love sounds and colors, delight in rich flavors, and indulge their emotions to satisfy their desires—thus they deem it the highest joy. Yet desire is the root of harm, sound the origin of deafness, the mouth is dulled by flavors, and the eyes are dimmed by colors. These do not come from without but arise from within.\n\nLiu said: Jie and Zhou lost their states because of them—how could this not be the great unhewn of misfortune? Thus, the sage eliminates desire to return to non-desire.\n\nLi said: Only the sage can empty the heart of desire, remain pure and still, and practice non-action. Disasters do not arise, and calamities do not occur. Transformations bring great peace, and one rightly returns to the Dao.\n\nLiu said: Abandoning the root of misfortune, returning to the source of blessing.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: The Dao’s Emptiness**\nLaozi said: The Dao is a thing of emptiness and nothingness—it is empty yet acts as fullness, nothing yet acts as being.\n\nXu said: Both are alike.\n\nWithout form, it is like emptiness; acting as being, it is like fullness. Subtle and wondrous, without substance, yet acting as if it has form—thus it has the formless form, the shapeless shape. Heaven receives the singular qi, vast and clear, and thereby achieves purity. The qi descends to transform and give birth to the myriad things, each with its distinct form.\n\nXu said: Heaven’s qi descends, earth’s qi ascends; the two qi intermingle and harmonize, giving birth to the myriad things. The myriad things have myriad forms, each distinct—none are alike.\n\nLi said: Empty yet acting as full, nothing yet acting as being—this means that within emptiness and nothingness, it divides the Three Powers and generates the myriad things. The Three Powers have images, hence it is called full; the myriad things have forms, hence it is called being. Taking the great to illustrate the small, it speaks of heaven receiving the singular qi. Thus, we know that things are endowed with the primordial harmony. Heaven, vast and clear, is without partiality, never deviating from the One. People, too, must diligently strengthen their resolve, remain pure and still, practice non-action, and never deviate from the Dao. Though the qi is singular, the forms differ—hence it is said each is distinct.\n\nTherefore, the sage knows that virtue and the Dao are undifferentiated, mysterious, and wondrously the same.\n\nXu said: *Hundun* (chaos) is the appearance of no distinction. The sage embodies the undivided primordial unity; virtue and the Dao are chaotically one, profoundly wondrous, originally the same.\n\nThey also know that heaven and earth’s purity and stillness both abide in the One.\n\nXu said: Heaven receives the profound and subtle qi, thus it is pure and high above. Earth receives the turbid and yellow qi, thus it is heavy and still below. Though the two poles differ, their abiding in the One is the same.\n\nThus, they align their hearts with heaven and are without knowledge.\n\nXu said: Their hearts align with the profound and empty, without knowledge or desire.\n\nLiu said: The four seasons operate without knowledge.\n\nThey align their bodies with the Dao and are without form.\n\nXu said: Their bodies align with emptiness, without form as their body.\n\nLiu said: They merge indistinguishably with the supremely wondrous, hence they are without form.\n\nOnly then does the heavenly Dao flourish.\n\nLiu said: The great Dao resides in humanity.\n\nTo restrain the will and return the thoughts.\n\nLi said: Aligning the heart with humanity, the heart is without distinction. Aligning the body with the Dao, the body is without false form. Uniting with heaven in virtue, joining the Dao in truth—this is called the flourishing of the heavenly Dao. How can one attain the flourishing of the heavenly Dao? By restraining the will, eliminating deep intentions, returning the thoughts, and abandoning excessive contemplation—only then can it be achieved.\n\nLiu said: The multitude speaks of restraining the heart without intent.\n\nIt departs yet cannot be pursued; it remains yet cannot be sent away.\n\nLiu said: Responding to things, it is distant yet abiding—its essence endures long.\n\nXu said: Following it, it is gone and cannot be pursued; its formless form remains and cannot be sent away.\n\nThe distant extends beyond the infinite and cannot be exhausted.\n\nLiu said: Vast and boundless.\n\nThe near is within oneself, yet people do not see it.\n\nLiu said: Faint and without image.\n\nThus, the noble person does not see, does not listen, does not speak, and does not eat all day. They inwardly know and embrace the mysterious.\n\nLi said: The noble person who cherishes the Dao restrains their brilliance, severs seeing and hearing, is cautious in speech, avoids extravagance, moderates their diet, cuts off rich flavors, empties the heart to contemplate the mysterious—hence it is called inward knowing. Not losing the subtle and wondrous, this is called embracing the mysterious.\n\nIf one wishes to see, there is nothing to be seen; if one wishes to listen, there is nothing to be heard; if one wishes to speak, there is nothing to be said; if one wishes to eat, there is nothing to be tasted.\n\nXu said: Realizing emptiness and penetrating delusion, even form is non-being. When emotions forget the dusty realm, what is there to speak of or perceive?\n\nLi said: Awakening to the emptiness of all realms, the heart becomes utterly still.\n\nHow serene and still—it cannot be tasted, returning to nothingness.\n\nWei said: Externally forgetting hearing and seeing severs the desires of sight and sound; internally forgetting the heart and mouth extinguishes the desires of speech and food. Only when inner and outer are extinguished can one attain serene stillness and return to nothingness.\n\nLi said: Amidst the bustle of competition and the cycle of action, serene stillness returns to the Dao of nothingness.\n\nIf one can always be pure, still, and practice non-action, there will be no self to return.\n\nLiu said: Those who attain the true are not governed by action.\n\nReturning to the state before birth, one is without body.\n\nLi said: Without inner or outer defilement, this is called purity and stillness. Calming the spirit and ceasing thoughts is called non-action. Merging the qi with the vast, returning to the state before birth, the body aligns with nature and is without self.\n\nTo nurture the body through non-action is to preserve the physical form whole.\nXu said: Through purity, stillness, and non-action, embracing virtue to nurture the body, harmonious qi is restored, thus preserving the physical form whole.\n\nWhen heaven and earth are replete, longevity is preserved.\nWei said: When the qi of the Dao returns to the body, one forgets the body; forgetting the body, virtue merges with heaven and earth. Heaven and earth do not seek self-preservation, thus they endure forever. In this way, the body is not preserved yet remains whole, and years are not guarded yet naturally extend.\nXu said: When the essential qi of heaven and earth fills my body, lifespan aligns with the two poles, hence \"longevity is preserved.\"\nLi said: Nurturing the body through non-action, pacifying people without affairs, merit reaches the four directions, and the Dao overflows the six voids—this is called repletion. Those who cultivate the body enjoy long life; those who govern the state ensure enduring prosperity—this is \"longevity preserved.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Lamenting Others**\nLaozi said: Lamenting others is not as good as lamenting oneself.\nXu said: *Lament* means to pity. Those who study pity others for sinking into worldliness and forgetting to return, yet this is not as good as lamenting one’s own inability to nurture the spirit and guard the body.\nLamenting oneself is not as good as cherishing the spirit.\nXu said: *Cherish* means to treasure. When the spirit labors, it departs the body; when it departs, life perishes. Indulging in the six desires injures the spirit and harms one’s nature.\nCherishing the spirit is not as good as containing the spirit.\nLi said: Though one cherishes the spirit, if it remains labored, it is like an infant still harmed by breathing—it does not compare to containing the spirit. To contain the spirit is to be outwardly unattached and undefiled, inwardly free from thought and worry. With inner and outer purity, the spirit naturally returns and does not leave the body—this is called *containing the spirit*.\nContaining the spirit is not as good as guarding the body.\nLi said: Though the spirit is most wondrous, it cannot stand alone; it must rely on the body to function. If one merely contains the spirit without guarding the body, when the body decays and form disperses, the spirit has nowhere to reside. To ensure the spirit’s long abiding, one must first guard the body. Guarding the body requires purity and absolute clarity, aligning with the Dao and virtue, penetrating the profound and subtle, merging with the ultimate void without duality. Preserving the Three and guarding the One, one unites with the true spirit.\nGuarding the body ensures long endurance and eternal abiding.\nLiu said: What is moved by emotions and desires is the human; without emotions and desires, it is merely the body—where then does the human reside? *Lament* means to pity. *Cherishing the spirit* is like valuing the child and honoring the mother. *Containing the spirit* means, having already esteemed it, to deepen this esteem, nurturing its radiance and preventing its dissipation. *Guarding the body* means the house is tranquil and the master at peace, the guest dispersed and the host settled. The body is the spirit’s dwelling, so one guards the body to pacify the spirit. When the body is not restless, the spirit is serene and at peace; form and spirit both preserved, one attains enduring abiding. The guest cannot be solitary; the traveler does not rely on the host. The spirit does not transform alone; it must depend on the body. Thus, the guest does not rely on the host, nor does the spirit stand without the body. Therefore, the body is the root of the spirit, and the host is the foundation of the guest. Those who cherish the spirit must first guard the body; those who preserve the guest must cherish the host. Hence, *containing the spirit is not as good as guarding the body.*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Spirit Gives Birth**\nLaozi said: The spirit gives birth to form, and form completes the spirit.\nChong said: The spirit serves as the function of generating form; without this function, form does not arise. Form serves as the benefit of nurturing the spirit; without this benefit, the spirit is not completed.\nLiu said: Form does not arise without the spirit; the spirit is not completed without form. Form cannot generate itself without the spirit; the spirit cannot complete itself without form.\nChong said: Form borrows the spirit to arise; the spirit embraces form to be completed. Without the union of form and spirit, there is no way for generation or completion.\nLiu said: Following the spirit’s transformation to generate forms, hence form cannot generate itself. Following the forms to complete the spirit’s work, hence the spirit cannot complete itself. When form and spirit unite, they alternately generate and complete one another.\nChong said: Benefit and function depend on each other, alternately generating and completing.\nLiu said: Though form and spirit differ, they rely on each other for generation and completion. The way of generation and completion cannot be achieved without union—hence *form and spirit unite*.\nThe spirit employs form, and form gives birth to the spirit. When the form’s function is manifest, the spirit’s work is achieved—this is the spirit giving birth to form. Form arises from the spirit, and the spirit employs form. When the spirit’s work is manifest, its manifestation arises from form—this is form completing the spirit. Hence, *they alternately generate and complete one another*. Form does not arise on its own; it must rely on the spirit’s transformation. When the spirit moves, form acts, and function is achieved. Completion arises from the spirit’s generation—this is the spirit completing form. The spirit does not transform alone; its movement must rely on form. When form acts, the spirit follows, and the spirit’s work is revealed. Revelation arises from the spirit’s employment—this is form completing the spirit. Hence, *they alternately complete one another*.\nThe spirit constantly cherishes humans, yet humans do not cherish the spirit.\nLi said: The spirit, having entrusted itself to humans, also desires that humans not die. Humans, relying on the spirit, must also ensure the spirit does not depart. To prevent its departure, one must cultivate the body and purify the heart. Only those who cultivate thus truly cherish the spirit. Yet most people are defiled and impure, unwilling to cultivate the body. Since the body is not cultivated, this is not cherishing the spirit.\nLiu said: The spirit constantly cherishes humans, desiring their tranquility, yet humans do not cherish the spirit, exhausting it without limit. Thus, one must *abandon sagacity and discard wisdom*, returning to non-knowing.\nLi said: The sage has no name; if there is no name, what is there to abandon? Great wisdom appears foolish; if wisdom is like foolishness, it is already non-knowing—what is there to discard? The present text speaks of *abandoning* and *discarding* because sagacity entails the burden of merit and fame, and wisdom entails the mechanism of discrimination. Discrimination wearies the heart; pursuing fame harms the body. When body and heart are harmed, form departs and spirit scatters—this is not cherishing the spirit or guarding the body, acting with loss of the Dao. It urges abandoning fame and ceasing thoughts to return to non-knowing—this is cherishing the spirit.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Constant Peace**\n\nLaozi said: The sage abides in constant peace. In harmony with Heaven and Earth, they commune with ghosts and spirits.\n\nLi said: The sage inwardly dispatches the heart’s perceptions and outwardly relinquishes the bodily form, merging with the profound stillness to unite with the true, aligning with emptiness and mystery in essence. Unaltered by yin and yang, unmoved by flourishing or decline, their mysterious virtue remains ever tranquil—thus they abide in constant peace. They share with Heaven and Earth the same capacity for shelter and support, and with ghosts and spirits the same rectitude and truth. Embracing the vast and enfolding the minute, they penetrate the hidden and fathom the subtle, free from times of obstruction or adversity, beyond days of hardship or destitution. Thus it is said: they unite their virtue with Heaven and Earth, and ghosts and spirits come to dwell with them.\n\nLiu said: Without affairs, without action, the obscure and the luminous flow unimpeded.\n\nThe multitude find peace in what is not truly peaceful—thus they are not at peace.\n\nWei said: Those who find peace in life are unsettled by death. Those who find peace in wealth and honor are unsettled by poverty and lowliness.\n\nLiu said: To find peace in action is to rely on what is not constant—losing one’s support leads to distress. For the Way of Heaven conceals what is full and replenishes what is empty, dismantles the strong and flourishing, and augments the weak and declining.\n\nLiu said: Diminishing the full and enriching the humble is like drawing a bow.\n\nChong said: The sun turns back at its zenith, the moon wanes after it is full, yang declines when it is at its peak, and yin weakens when it is strong—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nThe sage models themselves on Heaven in ordering things, practicing the law of impartiality: reducing excess, supplementing deficiency, restraining the high and powerful, and elevating the low and weak. They diminish thoughts and concerns, returning to childlike simplicity; they block perverse wisdom, embodying the sage’s uncarved simplicity.\n\nChong said: *Meng* (蒙) originally meant *meng* (朦), \"unclear.\" Excessive thinking breeds cunning contrivances, and too much deliberation gives rise to scheming treachery. Strange objects attract bandits and thieves, and deceitful distortions thrive in fraudulent streets—thus they urge reducing them to return to childlike simplicity. Childlike simplicity is unenlightened, free from the self-consuming fire of action; it does not adorn itself with cleverness to startle others. Closing off crooked wisdom and opening the luminous true wisdom, false methods do not spread, and the true Dao flows widely. Eliminating the perverse and embracing the upright is the foundation of sagely transformation.\n\nLiu said: Curbing anger and restraining desires, nurturing simplicity with rightful measure—when external wisdom is entirely discarded, this is the sage’s unadorned substance.\n\nThus, when the world esteems what endures, it may be called nurturing the mother. Constantly able to love the mother, the body endures long.\n\nLiu said: The spirit gives life to the body. Free from desires, the spirit is at peace—this is how one may nurture the mother. Without desires, the spirit is at peace; when the spirit is at peace, it endures long.\n\nLi said: In serving parents, filial piety comes first; in cultivating the self, the Dao is fundamental. The filial child nurtures well and gains renown for posterity; the scholar who cultivates the Dao attains truth and does not die. Nurturing the spirit and preserving the Dao—thus it is called loving the mother. When body and Dao are one, thus it is called enduring long.\n\nMaster Ren Zhen, with annotations by Liu Renhui and compiled by Bi Xuzi\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Body and Mind**\n\nLaozi said: When the body is empty, the myriad things arrive; when the mind is without, harmonious qi returns.\n\nChong said: When the body unites with the Dao, this is the body’s emptiness; when the mind aligns with Heaven, this is the mind’s absence. With the body empty, the myriad things come of themselves; with the mind absent, harmonious qi returns of itself. Thus, emptiness and nothingness are the supreme subtlety of non-action.\n\nTherefore, those who excel in nurturing the body conceal their person within the body without revealing it, and conceal others within humanity without displaying their abilities.\n\nChong said: To conceal the body is to remain hidden and unassuming, never displaying one’s talents. To conceal others is to blend with the common world, never revealing one’s wisdom or virtue.\n\nThus, the noble person’s governance must first die to the state.\n\nLiu said: *Die* means to forget. One who forgets the state, though occupying the highest position, is not esteemed; though possessing the four seas, is not enriched. Not being enriched, extravagance is discarded; not being esteemed, ostentation is abandoned. Abandoning ostentation, labor is not exhausted; discarding extravagance, resources are not depleted. When resources are not depleted, stores are full; when labor is not exhausted, the people are at peace. When the people are at peace, the state is secure; when stores are full, the state is substantial. A substantial state is the foundation of governance; a secure state is its root. To preserve the root and foundation of perfect governance—does this not arise from forgetting the state? If one violates this Dao, ruin and oblivion swiftly follow. Examine the records of the past, and the verdict is certain.\n\nWhen one has died yet not perished, the state flourishes. The people do not dare to scatter, and abundance is restored.\n\nLiu said: To forget yet retain it is why it does not perish; to govern through non-action is why the state flourishes. When all beings follow their nature, customs are joyful and dwellings peaceful, with sweet food and fine clothing, yet none visit one another.\n\nLi said: *Die* means to forget. Those who cultivate the body realize that when the body is absent, the person is absent; when the person is absent, the self is absent. Forgetting the body, the body endures. Those who govern the state embody emptiness and stillness, their virtue merging with the vastness of space. They forget the world entirely—thus it is said they must first die to the state. Having forgotten the state, they leave the world at ease, lighten taxes and corvée, and the people live in peace—thus it is said, \"having died yet not perished, the state flourishes.\" With governance in great harmony, none flee; thus it is said, \"the people do not scatter, the state is substantial.\" With the people prosperous, grain stores full, and defenses secure, it is said, \"abundance is restored.\"\n\nIf one can know the constant, actions will reverse course.\n\nChong said: When one knows the plain and true constant, preserving the profound virtue of the great Dao, all actions and conduct will reverse the common ways.\n\nLiu said: Those who know the constant Dao ensure that all undertakings return to restore true nature.\n\nThe multitude rejoices, using life to sustain life. Acting and losing it, their lifespan is exhausted.\n\nWei said: To die yet not perish is the constancy of longevity. But one’s conduct differs from the common, hence it is called *reversal*. The multitude, valuing the richness of life, act and lose life, thus their lifespan ends.\n\nChong said: The multitude take a hundred years as the norm, finding joy in comfort and rich flavors, using the six desires to sustain life. In acting, they harm life and lose their nature, leading to the exhaustion of their lifespan.\n\nLi said: The multitude use the life they possess to sustain the body, indulging their passions and desires to the utmost, believing this to be joy. Yet this harms life and injures the body. Above, they lose the Dao; below, they lose themselves—thus it is said, \"acting and losing it, their lifespan is exhausted.\"\n\nHow vast is the great thing of the world! So ceaselessly continuous, so darkly undifferentiated—unknowable.\n\nXu said: The *great thing* is the Great Ultimate and the great Dao. The Great Ultimate is the parent of Heaven and Earth, the mystery of the Dao. Ceaselessly continuous, unbroken and unending, darkly profound, undifferentiated—beyond the grasp of knowledge, difficult to discuss in words.\n\nThose who know it depart from it; those who desire it are separated from it; those who draw near it distance themselves from it.\n\nLi said: Seeking it with knowledge, one cannot attain it—thus it is said to depart. Grasping it with desire, one cannot obtain it—thus it is said to be separated. It cannot be made intimate—thus it is said to be distant.\n\nTherefore, the sage does not rely on the world, nor on ghosts and spirits, nor on the myriad things. He constantly takes emptiness as his body and nothingness as his mind.\n\nLi said: *Rely* means to depend or borrow. The sage attains the Dao without depending on the world in the manifest realm, nor on ghosts and spirits in the hidden, nor on the myriad things externally. He constantly takes emptiness as his body and nothingness as his mind, thus naturally accomplishing the Dao. If one’s mind forgets affairs and the will rests in emptiness and nothingness, though one does not seek to accomplish the Dao, the Dao is accomplished of itself.\n\nThese two—emptiness and nothingness—are called the body without body, the mind without mind. This may be called *guarding the spirit*.\n\nLi said: These two are emptiness and nothingness. Taking emptiness as the body is the body without body; taking nothingness as the mind is the mind without mind. The mind without mind is no-mind; the body without body is no-body. Utterly without body and mind—this is called *guarding the spirit*. Though called guarding the spirit, it is through emptiness and nothingness that the spirit naturally returns—thus it is called *guarding the spirit*.\n\nLiu said: Cutting off external entanglements, the spirit is inwardly at peace—this is the way of guarding the spirit.\n\nGuarding the spirit, penetrating the profound—this is called *uniting with the Dao*.\n\nWei said: The spirit does not leave the form—thus it is called *guarding*. When spirit and form preserve one another, they penetrate the profound and unite with the Dao.\n\nLi said: Able to guard the spirit with emptiness and nothingness, the spirit communicates with the subtlety of emptiness and nothingness, and the body unites with the essence of the great Dao—thus it is called *penetrating the profound*.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Without Thought**\n\nLaozi said: The wise person has no thoughts, no anxieties, no changes...\n\nWei said: The person of great wisdom takes the hearts of the common people as their own heart—thus it is called *without thoughts or anxieties of change*. They constantly abide in emptiness and non-action, serene and still, cultivating their form and body, and the myriad things are nurtured.\n\nLi said: Those without wisdom crave food and desire, while those with wisdom are unwilling to practice non-action—thus they remain mired in the ordinary and few can return to the Dao. The sage admonishes and warns, intending for emptiness and void—thus it is said: *The wise person should not multiply thoughts and anxieties, delighting in cunning and deceit*. They must constantly empty self and other, upright and tranquil in non-action, the body free from restlessness as serenity, the heart free from distraction as stillness. Inner and outer purity—this is cultivating the form and body. Harmless to things, they are nourished by things—thus it is called *nurtured*.\n\nChange means coveting the world’s treasures to gratify one’s passions. Li said: Accumulating thoughts and anxieties, delighting in deceit, ceaselessly pursuing desires—this is *change*, where the ten thousand conditions shift and alter. Rare and precious goods are the world’s treasures; insatiable craving, indulging desires to satisfy the heart, abandoning oneself to sensual excess—this is gratifying one’s passions. Though passions are gratified in the moment, governance collapses afterward. The principle is clear and evident—thus the following text illustrates it.\n\nThen arms rise on all sides, and calamity arises within. Liu said: Those in the same boat become enemies. When the state is in turmoil, the people are weary and exhausted.\n\nLi said: To aid the world with the Dao, to soften the distant with culture—thus the hundred clans use it daily yet remain unaware, and the myriad states naturally rejoice in peace. With few private concerns and scant desires, grain is prized and gold devalued; customs delight in familial harmony, music and ritual blend in harmony—this is the transformation of non-action. But if one indulges passions to the utmost, luxuriating in excess and craving victory, then the four outskirts bristle with strife, the five weapons stir in ceaseless motion, and behind the palace gates, calamity arises within. When the ruler is benighted and disordered, ministers grow disloyal and unrighteous, the state falls into turmoil, corvée labor never ceases, and the people are exhausted by transport and supply. The people grow weary and depart—thus the state, standing, is undone.\n\nChong said: The body takes spirit and qi as its root. When spirit guards and qi gathers, there is long life. But if one acts with purpose and busies oneself with affairs, spirit and qi are worn away; when spirit departs and qi scatters, the form is undone.\n\nLi said: The root of governing a state lies in pacifying the people. When the people are at peace, they are at ease; when they are in peril, they are wearied. At ease, the people remain; wearied, they depart. The flourishing of a state is fixed in its people. Once the people depart, the state is undone—this is known. Order and chaos arise from the Dao; flourishing and decay lie with the people. Cherishing the people with the Dao, heaven endures and earth lasts.\n\nLiu said: The people are the state’s root; when the root scatters, the state perishes. This is what is meant by \"bringing forth the treasure of the boundless\" and \"entering the sharp blades of the bandit’s axe and halberd.\"\n\nChong said: Axe and halberd are weapons. Life is more precious than ten thousand pieces of gold. When spirit abides and qi gathers, life is inexhaustible; when spirit perishes and qi scatters, the body is slain and life ends—thus it is said, \"bringing forth the treasure of the boundless.\" The six bandits invade from without, the three poisons arise within, their assault more severe than the six armies, their slaughter more cutting than axe and halberd.\n\nLi said: The treasure is the Dao of non-action; the bandit is the weapon of purposeful action. When I practice non-action, others transform of themselves—this is employing the Dao of non-action. If one does not use the Dao of non-action, it is like bringing forth the treasure of the boundless, as if wielding the weapon of purposeful action. Weapons harm things, consuming a thousand pieces of gold daily, sharper than blades—thus it is said, \"entering the sharp blades of the bandit’s axe and halberd.\" Therefore the sage practices non-action and refrains from busyness, desiring to pacify the state and its people.\n\nLi said: Valuing desires leads to harm for the people; war and conquest weary them. Non-action and refraining from busyness bring no harm, no weariness—thus the people are at peace, and this is the sage’s transformation. Hence it is said: If you can know the One, all affairs are complete.\n\nLi said: Employing the Dao through non-action is knowing the One; when merit is achieved and affairs are accomplished, matters are complete. Inwardly, clarity reaches the ultimate Dao—this is knowing the One. When conduct is perfected and virtue is fulfilled, following causes to realize effects, attaining the true Dao, affairs are complete. With no intent, virtue lingers, and ghosts and spirits submit.\n\nXu said: The One is the true One; virtue is constant virtue. To know the One is to know all without knowing anything—thus all affairs are complete. Empty and without intent, constant virtue lingers and abides. Thus one can govern heaven and earth, store the myriad things, and awe the thousand spirits, so that ghosts and spirits stand in awe and submit. Inwardly, to dissolve the ghost is to refine essence. The true One is the utmost extreme of the One; constant virtue is the utmost nobility of virtue. They are the root of essence and spirit, the origin of the Dao and qi. Thus spirit and essence submit, and the myriad qi return to their source.\n\nLi said: The sage is without intent, does not stir craving or desire, holds the Dao within, and virtue abides in the self—thus it is said to linger. Employing the Dao, the Dao flows near and far; embracing virtue, virtue covers the hidden and the manifest. Being what people turn to for refuge, they are also what ghosts and spirits submit to and follow.\n\nLiu said: To act with intent is to have virtue, and virtue thus departs. Therefore the scripture says: \"The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue.\" Its ghosts are not numinous—thus it is said they submit.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: \"I Command My Fate\"**\nLaozi said: My fate lies with me, not with heaven and earth.\n\nLi said: Heaven and earth are impartial, letting things transform of themselves. How could they determine the length of life? It is only that people’s conduct has good and evil, thus fate has prosperity and adversity. If one can preserve it with the Dao and receive it with qi, when qi continues, fate does not end; when the Dao abides, longevity naturally lengthens—thus it is said, \"not with heaven and earth.\" I do not see, do not hear, do not know; spirit does not leave the body and endures together with the Dao.\n\nLi said: Not seeing, thus not blinded by forms; not hearing, thus not deafened by sounds; not knowing, thus not ensnared by wisdom. Cutting off sounds and forms to attain purity, abandoning discrimination to practice non-action, spirit does not depart from the person—thus it is said, \"does not leave the body.\" When body and spirit unite, fate and the Dao become one—thus it is said, \"endures together.\" What is meant by \"not with heaven and earth\" is that one’s conduct is like this, thus attaining unity with the Dao.\n\nLiu said: Abandoning the use of ears and eyes, discarding the concerns of heart and intellect, forgetting the heart so that spirit does not leave the body—this accords with the constant Dao. I share with heaven and earth the governance of a single qi, guarding my root.\n\nWei said: Heaven, earth, and I are all born of the same natural qi, each a single thing—how could they give me my fate? I only discard heart-knowledge, sever ears and eyes, and each guards the root of that single qi—thus I endure together with the Dao. *Zhuangzi* said: \"Heaven and earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one\"—this is what is meant.\n\nLi said: The myriad things all rely on the great Dao; the three powers share the same qi. Yet people all pursue the branches and thus harm life. The Old Master guarded the root and thus could attain the Dao. If one can model the sage’s conduct, emptiness and naturalness may be achieved—not by imitating the multitude’s practice of goodness, not by practicing benevolence and righteousness, not by practicing loyalty and trust, not by practicing reverence, not by practicing love and desire. Then the myriad things will come of themselves, bringing benefit.\n\nLi said: To do good is to draw near to fame; to do evil is to draw near to punishment. The sage distances himself from both punishment and fame, and thus does not learn to practice goodness as the multitude does. The benevolent sacrifice themselves to benefit others; the righteous correct wrongs to rectify themselves. The sage cultivates life and thus does not kill; being free from perversity, he has no need to rectify—this is not the practice of benevolence and righteousness. Loyalty and trust are the blossoms of the Dao; the sage discards the blossoms and takes the fruit, and thus does not practice loyalty and trust. Filial piety is not innate nature; rites differ from utmost sincerity. A heart may be cruel while the countenance is reverent—this is not wondrous conduct, and thus it is not practiced. Desire is the root of misfortune and calamity; love is the source of affliction. When love and desire reside within the self, there is still no peace—how then can one attain the Dao? The sage is pure and tranquil, and thus does not practice love and desire. Harming nothing, benefit comes of itself.\n\nConstantly embracing fearlessness and non-action, the great Dao returns. Li said: The preceding—from practicing goodness to love and desire—all pertains to action. The Old Master embraced the Dao and held fast to virtue, serene and non-active. Constantly practicing this conduct, he thus attained perfection, and so it is said the great Dao returns. Liu said: Where there is benefit, things gather; where there is non-action, the Dao returns.\n\nThus the spirit-person has no radiance; the sage has no fame. Liu said: Inner illumination casts no light; virtue conceals itself amidst the throng. Li said: When the great Dao returns, its use is boundless. Transformation beyond measure is called \"spirit\"; wisdom that penetrates all is called \"sage.\" The person who is without affairs—truly, the spirit is non-active. Wisdom’s illumination is congealed and still, thus there is no radiance; the form is hidden and the function concealed, thus there is no fame.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: On Arms**\n\nThe Old Master said: Arms are the greatest inauspicious affair under heaven, not the treasure of the state. Liu said: When arms are mobilized, they harm beings; they bring ruin to states and destruction to families. No calamity is greater—how can they be called the state’s treasure? To treasure them is to not use them. Wei said: Guarding the Dao and practicing non-action, all under heaven find peace in what is naturally so, and arms are not used—this is called the great treasure. Why employ these inauspicious and baleful instruments? Liu said: The state’s treasure is to not use arms. To use them is to invite the peril of losing the state and its people. Li said: To quell disorder and bring stability, arms are indeed necessary. When employed with compassion, victory in battle comes of itself. Yet arms are fundamentally instruments of killing, and killing is an inauspicious affair—not the state’s treasure. To cherish life and detest killing, to value grain and love the people, to be without arms in war—this is the state’s treasure. Thus it is said: to treasure them is to not use them. To use them is to invite the peril of losing the state and its people—this is the greatest of inauspicious affairs. Liu said: If arms are used, it must come to this.\n\nTo bring peace to all under heaven, one should be without affairs—how much more so with arms? One cannot use them willingly. Thus the sage embraces subtlety and holds fast to simplicity, and does not dare to act or contend with all under heaven. Chong said: The sage is empty and non-active, embraces the Dao and guards virtue, and does not dare to pursue contention and action, vying with the people of the world for fame and profit. Li said: Preserving the essential Dao is to \"embrace subtlety\"; not losing the pure wind is to \"hold fast to simplicity.\" Being non-active and abandoning arms, ceasing from schemes and warfare, one does not contend with all under heaven. Liu said: Where there is action and desire, contention and seizure arise; where there is no affair and no action, joyful yielding persists without departure.\n\nThough there be fierce beasts, they cannot burn; though there be wasps, scorpions, insects, and snakes, they cannot sting; though there be blades and weapons, they cannot harm. Li said: With the mind dwelling in the correct Dao and conduct embodying simplicity, extending forbearance to others and harboring no harmful intent within, though external poisons exist, they cannot be inflicted. Liu said: Though a child be fierce and stubborn, he cannot harm a compassionate father; though beasts be ferocious and violent, they cannot harm a sage. For the sage has accumulated virtue and attained mysterious penetration—thus none under heaven can harm him. Wei said: Virtue pervades the six directions; mysterious penetration extends throughout the cosmos. The cosmos is to be as one body with the myriad things, as one mind with heaven and earth. Then fierce beasts and blades are but dust and grime of this body—how can they harm me?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Softness and Weakness**\n\nThe Old Master said: Under heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than qi; nothing is softer and weaker than the Dao. Liu said: Though qi is soft and weak, its gathering and scattering occur in due time. The Dao as a thing is without time or accumulation. The reason the Dao is soft and weak is that it envelops heaven and earth and penetrates the myriad things. Wei said: Heaven and earth reside within the empty mystery, yet the emptiness of the empty mystery cannot empty the Dao—thus it envelops heaven and earth. Metal and stone are hard and strong, yet they cannot obstruct the Dao—thus it penetrates the myriad things. Liu said: If it were not soft and weak, how could it envelop and penetrate? Softness gives rise to hardness; weakness gives rise to strength—yet none under heaven know the root and origin from which these arise. Wei said: Softness and weakness are the Dao and qi; hardness and strength are heaven, earth, and the myriad things. The root and origin are the natural Dao. Liu said: The qualities of hardness and strength arise from softness and weakness—each thing possesses them, yet their origin is unknown. This is what is meant by \"the nature and the Dao of heaven cannot be heard.\"\n\nThus being arises from non-being as its mother; non-being arises from emptiness as its mother; emptiness arises from the Dao as its mother. The natural is the root of the Dao. Li said: All things with form must arise from non-being—thus non-being is the mother. Originally there was nothing; because of the existence of being, non-being then came to be. Non-being is fundamentally empty and void. That which gives rise to non-being comes from emptiness—thus emptiness is the mother. Emptiness being empty, how can it circulate and penetrate without obstruction? It is due to the Dao—thus the Dao is the mother. The Dao is neither non-being nor being, neither solid nor empty, neither coming nor going, neither beginning nor ending. It is not made by things, nor created by people. Its origin is unknown—it is called the natural.\n\nThe Dao arises from the natural, and the natural is thus the root of the Dao. This is called \"non-being giving rise to being,\" each emerging in succession. If one wishes to conclude the preceding with the practice of softness and weakness, it is to give birth to hardness and strength.\n\nLiu said: From the shallow to the profound and wondrous, none know whence it comes—thus it is called the natural.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The People**\nLaozi said: The reason people treat life lightly and die young is that they bring it upon themselves—not because heaven and earth destroy them, nor do ghosts and spirits harm them.\n\nWei said: The greatest things of heaven and earth are life itself; how could they wantonly destroy human life? If one traverses the world with the Dao, even ghosts lose their numinosity—how then could they harm my life? It is because of their knowledge and the movement of their forms.\n\nWei said: Pursuing desires with cleverness and exhausting the body with labor, the form decays and the spirit is depleted—thus they die prematurely midway and do not live out their years.\n\nLiu said: Knowledge gives rise to movement, and movement pursues desires to ruin. They bring it upon themselves—what have ghosts and spirits to do with it? Thus, non-being gives rise to being, and formlessness gives rise to form. Why then would one ruin the completion of their affairs?\n\nXu said: Before a person is born, they originally have no body. Amidst the indistinct and vague, qi transforms, qi transforms into form, and form transforms into life. If one cannot remain pure and inactive, nurturing the spirit and guarding the body to attain long life and enduring vision, how much worse when one loses the principle of nurturing life, acts to incur guilt, and ruins the good work of forming the body, leading to early death?\n\nLiu said: The heart is originally inactive, but emotions and desires arise; the spirit and body are formless, yet form and color emerge. Even from formlessness and inactivity, form and desire arise—how much more so when one completes affairs only to ruin them? Is this not strange?\n\nIf one desires longevity, they must sever emotions and abandon desires, emptying the heart and mind, so that life returns to them.\n\nLi said: Indulging desires harms the body, while severing emotions prolongs life. Abandoning the thoughts of activity, exhausting both inner and outer, the heart and mind are emptied. Years do not come from external circumstances—life resides within oneself, thus it is called \"returning to it.\"\n\nWhen form and spirit unite as one, they can endure long.\n\nLiu said: To preserve life and prevent early death, one must remove emotions and abandon desires, exhausting the heart and mind—then life will naturally return, and no other protection is needed. \"Exhausted\" means complete absence of desire.\n\nLi said: When the soul departs from a person, the body dies; when the spirit unites with the form, life endures.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The World**\nLaozi said: Though one is in the world, let the mind not be in the world; though one is in a state, let the mind not be in the state; though one is in a village, let the mind not be in the village; though one is at home, let the mind not be at home; though the spirit is in the body, let the spirit not be in the body—this is called a person of the Dao.\n\nWei said: Wherever one is, if they forget, then they can be present everywhere.\n\nLiu said: A traveler on a distant journey—who stays to welcome guests? A seeker of truth—who clings to the body? Even the physical form is forgotten, let alone home and state, or even the abandonment of the human and heavenly realms—what purpose would that serve?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Subtlety of Mind**\nLaozi said: Misfortune arises from inattention.\n\nChong said: Those who are wealthy and noble believe themselves joyful and free from worry, but the two words \"inattention\" become the burden and misfortune of their bodies.\n\nDisaster arises from the subtlest threads.\n\n*Thread (si)*: In the versions of Li and Liu, it is written as *private (si)*.\n\nLi said: Rest is a burden to the body, and disaster brings ruin. One does not consider rest as rest, yet rest has already come; one does not consider private matters as disaster, yet disaster has already arrived. People know that in life they truly fear disaster and rest, and though they guard against them all day, they still worry about unexpected calamities. How much less can one who openly does evil avoid them? Thus, the noble person is cautious of the subtle, acting before things arise.\n\nChong said: *Thread* in other versions is mistakenly written as *private*. If one does not fear subtle evils, they will lead to entangling disasters—thus it is said: \"Small faults unaccumulated do not become great faults.\" Therefore, the scripture says: \"When the people do not fear authority, then great authority will come.\"\n\nGood arises from evil.\n\nLiu said: The cause of losing one’s life is the pursuit of a good name.\n\nBenefit arises from harm.\n\nLiu said: The fish that swallows the hook does so for the sake of fragrant bait.\n\nGreat arises from small.\n\nLiu said: A tree that embraces one’s arms begins as a tiny sprout.\n\nDifficulty arises from ease.\n\nLi said: The difficult affairs of the world must begin with the easy.\n\nLiu said: When one first treads on frost, it leads to solid ice.\n\nHigh arises from low.\n\nLi said: A nine-tiered terrace begins with a mound of earth.\n\nDistant arises from near.\n\nLi said: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\n\nOuter arises from inner.\n\nLi said: Because of the inner, the outer exists.\n\nLiu said: Words emerge outwardly, and actions affect the people.\n\nNobility arises from humility.\n\nLi said: From lowliness one attains honor.\n\nLiu said: Nobility takes humility as its root.\n\nMovement arises from stillness.\n\nLi said: From stillness comes movement.\n\nLiu said: Secure the body, then act.\n\nProsperity arises from decline.\n\nLi said: Extreme heat gives rise to cold.\n\nLiu said: When the sun reaches its zenith, it begins to decline.\n\nYin arises from yang.\n\nWei said: Yin and yang are like life and death. If the world were all good without evil, all beneficial without harm, then the name of good would have no cause to arise. Thus, the name of good arises from evil, and the name of benefit arises from harm—all these matters are the burdens of desire and self-interest.\n\nLi said: Extreme stillness gives rise to heat.\n\nLiu said: When the pitch-pipe is exhausted, the tuning pipes follow.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to one another, and emptiness and fullness complete one another.\n\nLi said: Being arises from non-being, and non-being arises from being—thus they give rise to one another. Emptiness is yin, and fullness is yang. Extreme heat becomes cold, and fullness completes emptiness; extreme stillness becomes agitation, and emptiness completes fullness—thus they complete one another.\n\nLiu said: Being is for the sake of benefit, and non-being is for the sake of function.\n\nThus, being returns to being, and non-being returns to non-being.\nWei said: Where there is good, there is evil—this is being returning to being. Where there is no benefit, there is no harm—this is non-being returning to non-being.\nLiu said: That which originates from Heaven inclines upward; that which originates from Earth inclines downward.\n\n*The Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Western Ascension, Scroll Five concludes here.*\n\n*The Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Western Ascension, Scroll Six*\nHua Yang Wei Chuxuan, Ju Qu Xu Daomiao, Chong Xuanzi, Ren Zhenzi Li Rong, Liu Renhui (commentary), Bi Xuzi (compilation)\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Abiding in the Dao**\nLaozi said: Man abides within the Dao, and the Dao abides within man.\nLi said: The Dao is so vast that nothing lies beyond it; man cannot exist without the Dao—thus we know man abides within the Dao. The Dao is so subtle that nothing is excluded from it; nothing exists apart from it—thus we know the Dao abides within man.\nFish abide within water, and water abides within fish.\nLiu said: Man’s spirit and qi commune with Heaven and Earth, just as fish, both within and without, depend on water.\nWhen the Dao departs, man dies; when water dries up, fish perish.\nLi said: This is an analogy. The fish’s relation to water is like man’s relation to the Dao: when the Dao is present, man endures; when the Dao departs, man perishes. When water exists, fish live; when water vanishes, fish die. Man must return to the Dao, just as fish must return to water. Thus, man is shaped by the Dao, just as fish are shaped by water. The Dao and water, man and fish—these must never be lost for even a moment.\nTherefore, the sage, knowing this, returns to the state before birth, casting aside extravagance and abandoning excess, severing all care and sorrow.\nWei said: Only by casting aside extravagance can one sever care and sorrow; only when care and sorrow are severed can one return to the state before birth. Once that state is regained, the Dao remains and endures forever.\nLi said: The self-aware must not for a moment lose the Dao. Returning to the state before birth means embracing and guarding the root. Casting aside extravagance means forsaking excess and extremity. Severing care and sorrow means being free of desire and grief. When the heart delights in the Dao, what sorrow can there be?\nThus, when form withdraws, spirit abides.\nLiu said: Still and unmoving.\nAll under Heaven return to it.\nWei said: To withdraw is to be at peace. When form is at peace, spirit remains within it.\nChong said: The forms of this world, though subject to death and transformation, leave behind a body of spirit that abides in the world, transforming things. All under Heaven, admiring its virtue, come to submit and return.\nLi said: When spirit congeals in the nine depths, form is said to withdraw. When the Dao dwells in sagely virtue, spirit is said to abide. Like the wind that arrives when summoned, all come drawn by the Dao, and the myriad regions pay homage—all under Heaven returns to it.\nLiu said: They return to stillness.\nWithout action, without affairs, the state is replete and the people prosper. Preserving the Dao and nurturing constancy—this is called profound unity.\nLi said: Where laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits abound. To refrain from cunning and calculation is called “without action.” To cease adorning weapons and armor is called “without affairs.” Not disturbing things with contrivance but instead pacifying the people with non-action, employing the worthy and wise, allows the hundred clans to flourish and the state to be replete. Turning warhorses to plow the fields, grain and wealth accumulate—thus the people prosper. Guarding the true and upright is called “preserving the Dao.” Progressing day by day is called “nurturing constancy.” Preserving the Dao, one attains the Dao; nurturing constancy, one attains constancy. Penetrating the constant Dao, one achieves profound unity.\nLiu said: When the ruler is without action, the myriad beings are at peace in their occupations. Stores are full, and the people prosper—such is the Dao of perfect governance.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Possessing the State**\nLaozi said: Those who possess a state take root deeply.\nWei said: The king, uniting the four great elements, succeeds Heaven in ordering things—he should take the non-action of the Dao as his root.\nLi said: Taking the Dao as root, what he attains is profound.\nHeaven and Earth cover and bear, nurturing the myriad things. Gold and jade, treasures of great worth, are not hoarded.\nWei said: Heaven and Earth act without action in covering and bearing, and thus they perpetually cover and bear. Thus, gold is hidden in mountains, pearls in the deep—precious treasures cannot escape their bounds. Why store them in treasuries?\nLi said: Those who possess a state should take the Dao as their root and virtue as their foundation. Virtue extends to all without exception; the Dao penetrates all without obstruction. Covered and borne by Heaven and Earth, they preserve their purity and tranquility. Nurtured by the myriad things, they attain enduring longevity. There is no need to accumulate gold and jade, for gold and jade naturally remain.\nLiu said: Heaven and Earth cover and bear of themselves; the myriad things nurture themselves. The sage, rooted deeply in perfect tranquility, regards gold, jade, and treasures as mere qi—discarding and making no use of them.\nTo set aside Heaven and Earth is to possess Heaven and Earth. To set aside one’s body is to preserve life and destiny.\nLi said: To set aside means to forget. Acting with contrivance, the world is lost; practicing the virtue of the Dao, the world is preserved—thus it is said to be possessed. Taking life as possession, love and nurture harm life—thus the body perishes. Able to forget the body, the body unites with the Dao, and life and destiny become boundless—thus the body is preserved.\nLiu said: To forget Heaven and Earth is to be without affairs; without affairs, things return to one. To forget the bodily form is to be without desire; without desire, life is preserved. If even Heaven and Earth and the bodily form are set aside, what need is there to cling to gold, jade, and treasures?\nThus, the noble person excels in what others find unexcellent, delights in what others find joyless, takes pleasure in what others find unpleasurable, does what others find undoable, trusts what others find untrustworthy, and practices what others find unpracticable. Thus, the Dao and its virtue are complete.\nLi said: The scholar of utmost learning studies what others cannot study; the one who establishes conduct does what others cannot do. Whether acting or not acting, all is action; whether studying or not studying, all is study. Teaching reaches all without exception; principle penetrates all without obstruction—thus the Dao and its virtue are complete.\n\nIn finer detail, what the vulgar and petty person delights in is action; what the noble person who embraces the Dao delights in is non-action—this is what the good person finds unexcellent. All people take pleasure in sounds and sights, yet I alone take pleasure in soundlessness and formlessness—this is what others find joyless. All people cherish fame and profit, yet I alone forget fame and profit—this is what others find unpleasurable. All people act with attachment, yet I alone act without attachment or aversion—this is what others find undoable. All people trust in the crooked, yet I alone trust in the upright—this is what others find untrustworthy. All people practice evil, yet I alone practice goodness—this is what others find unpracticable. The Dao stands in opposition to the common; its aspirations are lofty, its achievements sublime, its affairs perfectly rounded—thus it is said to be complete.\n\nLiu said: Goodness is goodness without attachment; joy is joy without affairs; pleasure is pleasure without flavor; action is action without acting; trust is trust without intent; practice is the practice of the Dao and its virtue. If these six phrases are not understood and enacted, then the Dao and its virtue are not complete.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\nLaozi said: The Dao is not mine alone—all things possess it.\nWei said: The Dao is present everywhere; how could the sage alone possess it while all things lack it? *Zhuangzi* states: \"The Dao is in excrement and urine.\" If even excrement and urine contain the Dao, how much more so all things!\nLiu said: What is made clear is that the Dao is present everywhere; those who cultivate it attain it. The myriad things do not know it themselves, yet the Dao naturally dwells within them.\nChong said: The myriad things, devoid of knowledge, are equal to straw dogs. They do not know that the sagely craftsman split the great undifferentiated simplicity, scattering it into boundless things. Unable to know the root of their own existence, they are born from the union of the Dao and qi, yet the Dao naturally dwells within them.\nLiu said: It is stored in its function. All people are born through spirit yet do not know that spirit gives birth to them.\nWei said: Not knowing themselves, nor knowing things, the spiritual Dao naturally and obscurely harmonizes. Chong said: Spirit is the root of life’s form; all are born through it yet do not know that spirit gives birth to me, and that spirit itself gives birth to me.\nLiu said: It is near at hand within all bodies, yet they cannot know it. When a lord bestows virtue upon the people, the people do not know they receive the lord’s virtue.\nChong said: When a lord bestows the virtue of non-action upon the people, the people obtain it and use it in their daily lives without awareness, believing it to be natural and not knowing they receive the lord’s virtue.\nWei said: The superior does not know the inferior, the inferior does not know the superior; when superior and inferior forget one another, this is governance by the Dao.\nLiu said: When achievements are complete and affairs are settled, the people all believe it is naturally so. Therefore, the sage conceals spirit within, and the po does not depart.\nChong said: The sage knows that spirit gives birth to me, thus nurtures spirit and guards the body, concealing spirit within form, refining form to transform the po, uniting with true spirit, merging into one. Not enslaved by hun and po, how could they depart?\nLi said: Po is quiescence. The restless and impetuous lose their spirit, but the sage follows the Dao, tranquil and non-active, so spirit does not leave the body, abiding silently within—thus it is said not to depart.\nLiu said: The utmost of stillness. Guard the mother, and the child is preserved.\nLi said: Preserve the Dao and maintain spirit—this is guarding the mother. The body suffers no harm, and the child is preserved. The people flourish, and the state is secured.\nLiu said: When the root is firm, the nation is at peace. The profound and empty accumulates and fills, and life is long.\nChong said: The profound and empty is the Dao. When the true and wondrous qi accumulates and fills my body, one can soar through the void, and life is long. Yet people can know Heaven and Earth and the myriad things but do not know the source of their own existence. To return to life and revert to the root is great ignorance.\nWei said: Life is the natural; the root is the Dao. I am utterly without knowledge, thus can return to unity and revert to the natural.\nLi said: Among sentient beings, humans are the most intelligent. They measure by the sun, draw near to Heaven, observe Earth, and comprehend the principles of things—nothing is unknown, thus they are called wise. Yet they do not know that the body is born of the Dao, return to the root and revert to the origin, clinging to ignorance until death, trusting fate to its end—this is great ignorance.\nLiu said: These are the false learners: though they exhaust teachings and master arts, though their wisdom is vast and their skills many, though they imitate the sagely path with strange doctrines, they do not awaken to the source of life or the Dao of returning to life and reverting to the root. Those who pursue externals may gain a fine reputation in the world, but in themselves, they are called fools.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five**\nLaozi said: The Dao of cultivating the body begins with concealing oneself in Heaven and Earth, dwelling in stillness at the origin of the myriad things.\nWei said: To conceal is to settle. First settle the body and form like Heaven and Earth in non-action, then the heart can dwell at the origin of the myriad things.\nThe origin is the Dao.\nLi said: The principle of cultivating the body must first begin with forgetting form. Once form is forgotten, nothing is seen—this is concealing oneself in Heaven and Earth. Then still the heart and return to the root, dwelling at the origin of the myriad things.\nLiu said: If even Heaven and Earth are concealed, what is there to see? Dwelling at the origin of things, what is there to possess?\nThe sage penetrates the profound origin, blends qi and thought to guard the body.\nXu said: The sage is ever tranquil and non-active, thus can penetrate the profound origin of the Dao, blend spirit and qi, contemplate the true spirit, and thereby guard the true—thus can endure and see far.\nLiu said: The origin is opened and unobstructed; qi and thought are blended yet not disordered. Guarding the true with this is the sage’s Dao.\nThe common person guards the body with emotion, love, greed, and desire.\n\nLiu said: Passion and love run deeper than the Qi and Bo seas; covetous desires weigh heavier than mountains and hills. To guard the body thus is the folly of the ignorant. Both employ things to guard the body, yet their virtue and power differ.\n\nLiu said: The sage’s wisdom and the fool’s emotions follow opposite paths. Though both devote themselves to their work, their uses diverge—one toward beauty, the other toward ugliness. When their deeds reach fulfillment, their effects become manifest.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: Virtue and Power**\n\nLaozi said: Virtue and power sustain Heaven and Earth; water and fire nurture the myriad things. Lofty mountains and deep abysses each have their proper place of return.\n\nLi said: Virtue and power are the subtle principles. What follows—Heaven and Earth, all tangible forms—each has its place of return. This illustrates that the formless Dao, if one can empty the heart and relinquish desire, will naturally come of itself.\n\nThe Dao does not seek emptiness, yet emptiness returns to it;\nVirtue does not seek the numinous, yet the numinous returns to it.\n\nLi said: The Dao is emptiness and non-being; virtue is numinous and wondrous. Emptiness and the numinous, wondrous and still, if one can empty the heart and forget the self, the Dao will naturally return. Embracing the numinous and guarding the wondrous, virtue will naturally return.\n\nLiu said: Emptiness returns to the Dao; the numinous returns to virtue. The Dao proceeds through emptiness; virtue likewise returns through the numinous.\n\nHeaven does not seek clarity, yet clarity returns to it.\nLiu said: That which is light and clear ascends.\n\nEarth does not seek turbidity, yet turbidity returns to it.\nLiu said: That which is heavy and turbid sinks.\n\nMoisture does not seek water, yet water returns to it.\nLiu said: Water flows toward the moist.\n\nDryness does not seek fire, yet fire returns to it.\nLiu said: Fire seeks the dry.\n\nThe myriad things do not seek to be seen in form, yet form reveals itself.\nLiu said: The formless cannot be seen; that which has form cannot be hidden.\n\nLofty mountains and great marshes do not seek flying birds and tigers, yet flying birds and tigers come of themselves.\nLiu said: Feathered and furred creatures return to forests and marshes.\n\nDeep abysses and rivers do not seek fish, turtles, and dragons, yet fish, turtles, and dragons come of themselves.\nLiu said: Like gathers with like; each has its proper dwelling.\n\nIf one can be empty, still, and non-active, though not seeking the Dao, the Dao will return of itself.\nLiu said: Those with agendas scatter their affairs; those who are non-active receive the Dao.\n\nFrom this we see: is not the nature of things spontaneous?\n\nLiu said: Things of the same kind resonate—not by forced division.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Good and Evil**\n\nLaozi said: When the common people do good, I do not know it; when they do evil, I do not know it; when they act with loyalty and trust, I do not know it.\n\nXu said: The four classes of people each have their natural dispositions. Without innate nature, they are difficult to transform—like the blackness of crows or the whiteness of cranes, which are not the work of dyeing or washing.\n\nLi said: The sage extends compassion and opens the way of instruction, urging all to abandon evil deeds and establish good causes, to relinquish falsity and practice loyalty and trust. Yet those lost on the path cannot understand; those who stray do not return. Each follows its karmic lot, drifting in confusion, unable to forget merit and blame, ceaselessly generating good and evil.\n\nThose who do good receive reward; those who do evil incur punishment. The loyal and trustworthy become worthy ministers; the deceitful and cunning become mad rebels. All arise from deeds that are good or evil, and thus names are right or wrong. These are the actions of sentient beings—not what the sage knows. This is expedient teaching; when the time comes, they will awaken of themselves—hence the words \"I do not know.\"\n\nThus, when good is accumulated, good qi arrives; when evil is accumulated, evil qi arrives.\n\nLi said: Earlier, the expedient method spoke of \"not knowing,\" allowing foolish emotions to persist. Fearing that evil roots were not yet severed, this true teaching earnestly clarifies: Without accumulating good, one cannot establish a name; without accumulating evil, one cannot destroy the self. Thus, it is clear that when good is accumulated, good comes; when evil is accumulated, evil arrives—this is no empty claim, but as certain as echo follows sound. Speaking thus is to urge the heart to abandon evil and return to good.\n\nLiu said: The sage’s words make clear that he responds to things without intention—good and evil accumulate of themselves. Who knows them?\n\nTherefore, the sage says: I embrace the beginning of all under Heaven and guard the mother of all under Heaven, and the myriad things increasingly honor me, thereby preserving my body.\n\nLi said: \"I embrace the beginning of all under Heaven\" is to hold the Dao; \"guard the mother of all under Heaven\" is to contain virtue. With virtue and power within, one is revered by others—hence \"increasingly honor.\" Things return to the Dao, and the Dao sustains things. When people and things are preserved, it is said to \"preserve the body.\"\n\nLiu said: When the source is pure, the streams are clear; when the mother is guarded, the children are nourished.\n\nMy mind is always without knowing.\nLiu said: To know is not the way of guarding the mother.\n\nHow then could I know their good and evil deeds?\n\nLi said: The sage forgets the self within and thus has no self or others; hence \"my mind is always without knowing.\" He forgets things without and thus has no good or evil. Both self and others are forgotten—how could he know their good and evil deeds?\n\nLiu said: If one guards the mother yet still knows, how could one know the deeds of the child?\n\nWhen good is accumulated, the spirits assist in its completion.\nWei said: Accumulating good moves the spirits; the spirits naturally assist in its completion—this too I do not know.\n\nHeaven’s way likewise protects good people.\nWei said: Heaven’s way is impartial, yet it constantly aids good people—Heaven likewise does not know.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: Stillness of Mind**\n\nLaozi said: My Dao is tranquil and still.\n\nWei said: This is like dead ashes or withered wood.\n\nWhen the mind is dead, life arises; stillness returns to the mandate.\n\nWei said: Though one does not lose life, the mind is like that of the dead—thus one is ever alive. Because the mind is dead and still, one can return to the natural mandate.\n\nChong said: \"Mind is dead\" means the heart is like cold ashes.\n\nLife arises and accumulates, permeating and nourishing, pouring and lingering.\n\nLi said: Still the mind, quiet the intent, and through the Dao generate life—hence \"generating life.\" The Dao’s flow is unceasing, long moistening the body—thus \"accumulating and permeating.\" The mysterious fluid is the Dharma-water—this is called \"nourishing and pouring.\" Its flow into the body encounters obstructions—hence \"lingering.\" Halted by the Dao—thus \"abiding.\"\n\nLiu said: Accumulating qi and blood to form the body—such is the meaning of \"generating life.\" The mysterious veils and permeating moisture.\n\nLiu said: \"Mysterious veils\" refers to covering the bodily frame. \"Permeating moisture\" means the fluid’s ebb and flow, opening all meridians and vessels.\n\nThe primordial qi envelops it.\nLi said: Quieting the intent from action allows life to preserve itself; stilling the mind to return to the Dao lets the mandate restore itself. By returning to the Dao, one is covered by the Dao—hence \"mysterious veils.\" The numinous fluid flows and moistens—hence \"permeating moisture.\" Human life arises from primordial qi. Cherishing essence and preserving qi, qi never leaves the person; the person lives by qi and is enveloped by it—hence \"envelops it.\"\n\nLiu said: Though life is called the work of spirit, without qi there would be no transformation and nurturing. Its roots grow ever deeper.\n\nWei said: \"Veils\" means covering. All living things arise from the accumulation and permeation of harmonious qi’s nourishing flow, congealing into mysterious veils and permeating moisture. Further enveloped by primordial qi, their roots grow ever deeper, sharing the same origin as the Dao.\n\nChong said: \"Pouring\" is like the fluid in a person’s hands and feet. \"Veils\" means covering. Disciples embrace the primordial and guard the One; their spirit and qi accumulate and fill, permeating the entire body. The nourishing fluid and vital essence linger and abide in the hundred bones. The mysterious Dao covers and shelters, moistening within and without. The primordial Dao-qi envelops their form. The myriad qi endure long, the true spirit anchors and stabilizes—thus their roots grow ever deeper, attaining long life and enduring vision. This forms the fourfold firmness.\n\nLiu said: The true nature is boundless, the bodily frame unharmed. Void of mind within.\n\nWei said: Attaining the great elements of earth, water, and wind, one’s body becomes firm and enduring.\n\nChong said: Sealing the senses and closing the gates, the four faculties of ears, eyes, mouth, and nose remain firm. Worldly dust cannot enter, and the center is empty and void. Thus one can draw forth the essence of the myriad things.\n\nWei said: Though the four elements form the body, within it is tranquil and still, akin to being mindless—thus the essence of the myriad things all return to it.\n\nLi said: Covered by the mysterious Dao, enveloped by primordial qi, the Dao is distant and qi enduring—hence \"its roots grow ever deeper.\" With deep roots and tranquil extremity, existence abides beyond the body. The four great elements remain unbroken—thus \"fourfold firmness.\" Forgetting emotions and emptying the self, within and without are pure and clear, profoundly still and void—this is called \"mindless.\" With body and mind forgotten, all attachments severed, one merges with the realm of emptiness and obtains the essence of the profound and obscure—hence \"drawing forth the essence of the myriad things.\" The things of the boundless naturally return to it.\n\nChong said: Those who cultivate the Dao refine their conduct and practice qi—thus the myriad things, celestial immortals, radiant essences, and luminous spirits, the subtle and wondrous, the boundless and formless Dao, all return of themselves.\n\nFor it is empty, void, and desireless.\nLi said: All tangible things are weak and decaying; the things of the boundless are called \"essence.\" The boundless essence is the true Dao returning to oneself. How is this achieved? Through purity, stillness, and emptiness—thus it arises naturally.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Admonitions**\n\nLaozi said: Listen well, I shall tell you again: the ancient masters are my own body.\n\nChong said: Among Laozi’s ten titles, one is \"Ancient Master.\" Both the *Record of Responses and Titles* and the *Record of Manifest Traces* state: During the era of the Three Sovereigns, he was called Ancient Master. This clarifies that the body of Lord Lao has transformed across the ages. When passing through the pass, he left these words to admonish Yin Xi, hence calling himself the guide of the Western Land, pointing to ascension. When Yin Xi, as his disciple, received the Dao, the transmission of the *Five Thousand Characters* was entrusted to him, along with the oral instructions on the Nine Elixirs and the essentials of the Nine Chambers. About to transform the Western Land and ascend into the Great Subtlety, he wished to reiterate his teachings to resolve Yin Xi’s doubts. Thus he said: \"The ancient masters are my own body,\" dispelling Yin Xi’s uncertainties and revealing the portent of his Western transformation. Later people falsely altered this to \"The ancient masters are my teachers\"—how absurd!\n\nMoreover, the *Annals of Emperors and Kings* record that in the year *dingmao* of King Wen’s reign, Lord Lao was born. In the reign of King Zhao, he resided at the pass. In the twenty-fifth year, *guichou*, he expounded the scripture to Yin Xi. In the twenty-sixth year, the fourth month, he ascended into the Great Subtlety. In the twenty-ninth year, Yin Xi met him again at the Green Sheep Market in Shu, where Lord Lao appeared once more and transformed the Western lands. Later people falsely claimed that during the reigns of Kings Ping, Jing, You, and Li, and King Ding, he entered the Flowing Sands of the West—all erroneous! Why? Yin Xi was a grandee of King Kang’s court. During King Zhao’s reign, he requested to serve as the Pass Keeper to await Lord Lao—clearly not the time of Kings Ping or Jing.\n\nNow I shall return my spirit to the nameless.\nLi said: The nameless is the constant Dao of tranquil realms. Responding to conditions and guiding beings, arising from the true to manifest virtue—when the transformations of the Dao cease, one withdraws and returns to the root, hence \"returning the spirit.\" Coming forth, one manifests form from formlessness; returning, one reverts from the named to the nameless—hence \"returning to the nameless.\"\n\nSever the body, extinguish being, and endure endlessly.\nChong said: \"Spirit\" is the term for the numinous and wondrous. Returning the numinous spirit to the mysterious and void, to emptiness and stillness, nameless and formless—severing the body of this world, extinguishing the form of being, one attains the supreme Dao, enduring endlessly.\n\nLi said: Ceasing transformation and departing from response is called \"severing the body and extinguishing being.\" The Dharma-body remains unmoved, the true Dao congealed and still—this is called \"enduring endlessly.\"\n\nNow I depart, returning to the One Origin.\n\nLi said: \"Depart\" means to go forth. The Venerable Lord journeyed from the east to the west, hence \"I depart.\" The true Dharma is not one, yet the correct Way is uniquely One. Coming from the east, one returns to the Dao—this is also \"returning to the One Origin.\"\n\nSuddenly, he vanished from sight.\n\nLiu said: Life and death are free and unrestrained, beyond the reckoning of ordinary sentiment.\n\nIn an instant, the lodging blazed with light, its five colors dark and bright.\n\nChong said: The lodging is where past affairs return. During his time in Zhou, the Venerable Lord harmonized his light with the world, subtly advancing and concealing, observing transformations amidst the dust. Hidden among men, he remained unknown. Now, wishing to cease his journey and return to the Origin, to dissolve form and follow transformation, he suddenly vanished from sight. In that instant, the lodging radiated brilliance, illuminating within and without, its five colors dark and bright, startling the eyes and ears.\n\nLi said: \"In an instant\" means in the blink of an eye. The Venerable Lord’s spirit is wondrous and unfathomable, his Dao-power natural. When he can be without being, he suddenly vanishes; when he is not yet has being, he emits five-colored light, shining in all directions. This display of divine transformation serves as a warning to the receiver.\n\nXi emerged into the courtyard, kowtowed, and said: \"I wish the divine one would appear once more and bestow upon me a single essential teaching, that I may preserve the Origin.\"\n\nChong said: Having witnessed the divine transformation, he now recognized the Great Sage. Thus, he came forth into the courtyard, kowtowed, and knocked his head to the ground, wishing only that the divine one would appear again. Though he had received instruction, its meaning was profound and its path long, leaving him uncertain of where to begin. Hence, he sought a single essential teaching to embrace the One and preserve the Origin.\n\nLooking up, he beheld him suspended in the air, seated in emptiness, tens of yards above the earth. His form was that of a golden man—now present, now absent, now dim, now clear; neither old nor young, yet ever-changing.\n\nLi said: With his sincere wish uttered, the Dark Sage was not far. Looking up to the heavens, he immediately saw the Venerable Lord seated upright in the void, exalted high above the earth. His countenance was not that of a hoary-headed elder, his form purely that of a golden body. Sometimes without, sometimes within—hence \"now present, now absent, now dim, now clear.\" Neither great nor small—hence \"neither old nor young, yet ever-changing.\"\n\nHe said: \"I earnestly admonish you—guard this well.\"\n\nRong said: He again expounded the wondrous Dharma, instructing him to preserve the Way.\n\nEliminate defilement, cease thoughts, still the mind, and guard the One.\n\nLi said: The entanglements of conditioned existence, the filth of the human realm, the waves of discriminating thought, the delusions of love and aversion—all are defilements, commonly called \"dust.\" Restrain the passions, endure sensory pleasures, comprehend being and penetrate non-being, and sweep all away—hence \"eliminate.\" Let the mind be free of clutter—hence \"cease thoughts.\" Neither attached within nor without—hence \"still the mind.\" Concentrate the spirit on the Dao, focus the will without division—hence \"guard the One.\"\n\nLiu said: Whatever is not true nature is defilement. Cease the workings of the mind, and all defilements are eliminated. Guard the One without wavering, and the true mind becomes still.\n\nWhen all defilements are eliminated, all affairs are complete.\n\nLi said: When the hundred evils are dissolved, they are said to be \"eliminated.\" When the ten thousand virtues are fully realized, they are said to be \"complete.\" The essential teaching of my Way—once the earnest admonition is finished, he immediately vanished.\n\nLi said: Earlier, he was instructed to embrace the Origin and guard the One, admonished to eliminate defilement and cease thoughts. When deluded thoughts are stilled, right action arises. One may thereby perfect truth, attain the Dao, govern the household, and transform the state—no affair is impossible, hence \"complete.\" The Dark Origin responds to things, fundamentally to save people. When people follow the teachings, no principle remains unfulfilled. When things are saved and people delivered, virtue perfectly transforms and provides. Following form, he entered stillness—hence \"vanished.\"\n\nXi, not knowing where he had gone, wept in longing and remembrance. He resigned his office, feigning illness.\n\nLi said: The Sage entered the wondrous, his whereabouts unfathomable. Gazing up in reverence, he shed tears; yearning to leave worldly affairs, he returned to non-action, hence his pretense of illness.\n\nAbandon thoughts and guard the One—all affairs are complete.\n\nLi said: Hold the precepts in the heart, establish conduct according to the scriptures, and seek nothing beyond—this is \"guarding the One.\" When the dust of entanglement is exhausted, the true Dao of non-action naturally manifests. With wisdom full and virtue replete, the ten thousand practices are all perfected—hence \"complete.\"\n\n*End of Collected Commentaries on the* Scripture of Western Ascension, *Fascicle Six*\n\n[Note: #1 The phrase \"Water and the Dao, people and fish\" should read \"People and the Dao, water and fish.\"\n#2 \"Obtained earth, water, and great wind\" should read \"Obtained earth, water, fire, and wind.\"\n#3 This line in the *Imperially Commissioned Commentary of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"Because it is empty and desireless.\"\n#4 \"The essential teaching of my Way, once the earnest admonition is finished, he immediately vanished\" in the *Imperially Commissioned Commentary of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"The essential teaching of my Way.

      "translated_text": "**Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Western Ascension**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Western Ascension*. Compiled by the Northern Song Daoist Bixuzi (Chen Jingyuan). Six fascicles. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category. Collated with: The Imperial Annotated Edition by Emperor Huizong of the Song (Zhenghe Era).\n\n**Preface to the Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Western Ascension**\n\nWhen the world’s Dao was in mutual decline and the purest of comforts grew scarce, the sage, though not dwelling in the mountains and forests, concealed his virtue. As the Zhou declined, Laozi did not hide his person to remain unseen, nor seal his words to prevent their emergence, nor conceal his wisdom to withhold its revelation—it was the great perversity of the times. Thereafter, weary of the world and resigning from office, he sought to return to the primordial and advance beyond. Moreover, when heaven and earth close, the worthy withdraw—this has been so for ages.\n\nAt that time, Guan Yin, observing the qi, knew that a profoundly realized person was traveling west. He then purified himself, blocked the road, and invited him to his dwelling, where he inquired in secret. Thereupon, Laozi expounded upon matters in some detail. His subtle words and profound meanings transcended the questions of the *Five Thousand Characters*, and these were recorded into a book titled *Record of the Western Ascension*.\n\nThe Dao is self-so. Those who practice it may attain it; those who hear it may speak of it. Yet those who attain it—how could they fathom it? Those who speak of it—how could they comprehend it? Thus, he concealed himself within himself and did not emerge; he concealed others within others and did not appear.\n\nAs for the empty, primal, and indistinct—these are the roots of the things that exist. The ten thousand things share a common origin—this is the source of the things that exist. Those who know it depart from it; those who desire it separate from it; those who approach it distance themselves from it. Only those who attain it hold it within themselves without forgetting. Thus, he concealed his wild words and remained silent. Therefore, what is transmitted today—is it not like the straw dogs of old? What is savored today—is it not the dregs of antiquity?\n\nYet in cultivating the Dao, one daily diminishes—is this not forgetting action? In pursuing learning, one daily increases—is this not prizing words? Thus, attaining the One, the ten thousand affairs are complete. With no mind to retain virtue, even ghosts and spirits submit. Know that the One and words become two; two and the One become three. Beyond this, subtle practices and profound words proliferate without end. Hence, Zhuangzi often praised those whose words remained within this principle.\n\nBixuzi, hearing of this tradition with delight, searched the hidden archives and found nearly five commentators. First, he collated and selected the correct interpretations of the scripture; later, he excised the erroneous annotations. Compiling them into two sections, he now presents them in six fascicles, retaining the original title *Laozi’s Scripture of Western Ascension*. This is offered to fellow students, that they may clearly perceive the great essence of the ancients—not merely to entangle themselves in affirming or denying, obscuring their spirit in shallowness, and forgetting the vast emptiness of the Great Clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Western Ascension, Fascicle One**\n\nCommentators:\nHua Yang Wei Chuxuan\nJu Qu Xu Daomiao\nChongxuanzi\nRenzizi Li Rong\nAnnotations by Liu Renhui\nCompiled by Bixuzi\n\n**Chapter One: Western Ascension**\n\n*Laozi ascends west.*\n\n**Chongxuanzi’s note:** The opening marks Lord Yin’s recording of events, clarifying the intent of Lord Lao’s transformative journey.\n\n*Opening the Dao of Jambudvīpa.*\n*Styled \"Ancient Master,\" skilled in entering the primordial.*",

      "translated_text": "**Renzizi’s note:** \"Ascends west\" refers to departing from the ancestral lineage of Zhou. \"Opening the Dao\" means that when Lord Lao departed Zhou and journeyed to the western extremity, he would open the Dao in those lands—hence \"opening and guiding.\" \"Jambudvīpa\" is the name of a country in the western extremity. \"Styled Ancient Master\" signifies the Great Dao of the primordial origin, born before heaven, thus called \"Ancient Master,\" an alternate name for Lord Lao. The sagely virtue broadly extends, unbound by any place; wisdom and ability illuminate the realm, though bright, it is ever dim to the common eye. The essence can activate its function, though in motion, it remains ever still. Thus, it wondrously aligns with the principle of names, skillfully enters into independence, and congeals in the primordial act. This is what is meant by: \"The Dao constantly acts without acting, and all things exist within it, yet in things it is absent.\" It neither ends nor begins, eternally abiding in continuity.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** Where there is life, there is a beginning; where there is death, there is an end. The Dao, being without death or life, is thus said to neither end nor begin. Truly constant and unmoving, it has existed since ancient times. Therefore, ascending to follow the Dao, he passed through the pass. The Pass Keeper Yin Xi perceived the qi.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** From this spring realm, he journeyed to that autumn land, expounding the Dao of the Ancient Master and perfecting the ever-abiding virtue. The path he trod led through the Hangu Pass.\n\n**Chongxuanzi’s note:** The pass is the ancient Peach Forest. \"The Pass Keeper Yin Xi perceived the qi\" is recorded at the beginning of this scripture to clarify the circumstances of their encounter. At that time, Master Yin built a thatched hut at the foot of Mount Zhongnan, observing the stars and gazing at the qi. He saw the celestial principle moving eastward, purple clouds advancing west, and the qi above the pass taking the form of dragons and serpents, extending into the Milky Way. For a month, a warm breeze arrived thrice. Knowing this to be the sign of a sage crossing the pass, he sought to become its keeper to await him—hence \"perceived the qi.\"\n\n**Xu’s note:** Through accumulated resonance with the mysterious, purple and black vapors first arose. Through fasting and vigilant waiting, he indeed encountered the sagely guest.\n\nHe expounded the *Dao and Virtue*, arranging them into two fascicles.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** Perceiving the opportunity, he requested the secret treasure of eternal abiding, responding with emptiness to the wondrous subtleties of the mysterious origin, desiring that all beings return to principle and all true persons attain the Dao. \"Arranged\" means divided; \"fascicles\" refers to the written compilation, split into two scrolls.\n\nHe taught the essentials of the Dao to Master Yin.\n\n**Chongxuanzi’s note:** \"Taught\" marks the beginning of Lord Lao’s discourse. \"Master Yin\" refers to Yin Xi. He would teach the essentials of cultivating the perfect Dao and the causes of ascending to truth and transcending the world. \"Essentials\" is the general term for the most wondrous.\n\nThe Dao is self-so.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** \"Self-so\" means inwardly without self-nature, outwardly without dependence on conditions, pure and empty, mysterious and still, its origin unfathomable—thus called \"self-so.\" It cannot be divided into inner and outer by self or other, nor can its form or substance be determined by existence or nonexistence. Its qi cannot be fixed by yin or yang, nor can its roots and branches be traced through causes and conditions. This is the great Dao of emptiness and self-so.\n\nThose who practice can attain it; those who hear can speak of it.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** In every age, there are stubborn scholars and common followers mired in convention. Hearing that the Dao is self-so, they claim no cultivation is needed, causing practitioners to lose the means of entering the Dao. Thus, these words urge adherence: if one can follow principle in practice and act according to the teachings, one can attain truth—hence \"can attain.\" Those who hear the Dao and practice it all attain the method; speaking of the Dao, their words all accord with principle—thus initially called \"can speak.\"\n\nThose who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.\n\n**Chongxuanzi’s note:** Knowing that the wondrous Dao is not a dharma of form or sound, it cannot be explained through words. To name it with form or sound is to distance oneself from the Dao.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** Principle is originally without words; words are borrowed to elucidate principle. Once principle is profoundly realized, one naturally forgets words—hence \"those who know do not speak.\" Those who cling to teachings become deluded, insisting words are correct. Failing to grasp principle, they are called \"those who speak do not know.\"\n\nThe reason for speaking is to communicate through sound.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** \"Communicate\" means to connect and understand. Since those who know do not speak and those who speak do not know, why then do sages compose mysterious words? It is to borrow words to convey principle, for the Dao is originally without words. Thus, they discuss through words to mutually illuminate.\n\n**Liu’s note:** To awaken the unenlightened, words are necessary. Explaining this through words, that is understood—this is called \"mutually illuminating.\"\n\nThose who do not know the Dao dispute through words.\n\n**Liu’s note:** Failing to grasp the mysterious origin, they vainly contend over names and principles.\n\nWithout hearing or speaking, one does not know the reason why.\n\n**Chongxuanzi’s note:** Those who have attained understanding speak not, nor do they expound, naturally aligning with the true and constant. The common crowd, hearing nothing and speaking nothing, cannot awaken to the Dao—thus they do not know the causes and conditions of cultivating the great Dao.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** \"The reason why\" refers to the roots of principle, teachings, truth and falsehood, good and evil. If sages did not speak and common people did not hear, how would they know the karmic consequences of good and evil or the right and wrong of truth and falsehood? Teaching opens the mechanism of the wordless, allowing one to first know the supreme principle never before heard. Only then can one grasp the \"therefore\" and understand the \"reason why.\" The words spoken and the principles expounded are beneficial in this regard.\n\nFor example, those who know music recognize sound through strings.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** Sound does not arise from emptiness; it must come from strings. Principle is not self-evident; it is ultimately revealed through words.\n\nThe heart knows its words, but the mouth cannot convey them.\n\n**Chongxuanzi’s note:** Those who know music distinguish tones through strings; those who practice the Dao distinguish its purport through words. Both are without form or color, subtle and wondrously profound. The heart understands, but the mouth cannot express it.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** The heart knows the subtleties of sound, but the tongue is insufficient to convey them. The wisdom that embodies profound principle cannot be fully explored by shallow discourse. The Dao is deep and wondrous; those who know do not speak.",

      "translated_text": "Liu states: Silk and bamboo produce sound, yet even those who understand it cannot fully explain it—how much less can one speak of the Dao, which has no form or appearance? How could those who know it ever put it into words?\n\nXu states: The subtle and wondrous Dao transcends speech, and thus those who know it do not speak.\n\nTo recognize the sorrow in sound is to inwardly reflect upon it.\n\nLiu states: To lose a loved one and then regain them—would this not evoke joyous leaping? To be lost in the Dao and then awaken—could one not weep in sorrow? To inwardly reflect upon sound is to abandon words and contemplate principle.\n\nThe heart commands the mouth to speak, yet speech does not know.\n\nXu states: The heart can illuminate the Dao, and desires the mouth to speak, but speech becomes delusion—hence it is said to \"not know.\"\n\nChongxuanzi states: The Dao is as difficult to describe as music; only the heart fully comprehends it, not the mouth. To speak of it in confusion is already to deviate from the Dao.\n\nLiu states: Speech arises from the heart, yet the mouth does not know the heart—thus one forgets words to seek meaning.\n\n**Chapter Two: The Dao’s Profound Depth**\n\nLaozi says: The Dao is profoundly deep, the abyss of emptiness and origin.\n\nWei states: \"Deep\" means ultimate; \"abyss\" means hidden. The body of the Dao is emptiness and origin, yet it encompasses all phenomena—hence it is called the profound abyss.\n\nXu states: Its depth resides at the center of the cosmos; its hiddenness is the treasury of the ten thousand things. Its emptiness can embrace heaven and earth; its origin gives birth to being and non-being.\n\nThough you have heard its explanation, your heart does not yet glow crimson.\n\nChongxuanzi states: I fear that Master Yin, though sincere in seeking the Dao, lacks the reality of diligent practice. To make this clear, I offer this warning.\n\nRenzizi states: This is a warning and an exhortation. *Wei* means subtle; *dan* means red. The profound and abstruse Dao, the principle of emptiness and origin—even with a sincere and subtle heart, it remains difficult to know. How much less can a shallow mind or weak resolve comprehend it? One must practice deeply, believe firmly, and thus attain realization.\n\nWhy is this so? Because writing cannot exhaust speech.\n\nXu states: Why can one not fully grasp its subtlety and wonder? Because writing cannot exhaust speech, nor speech exhaust meaning.\n\nLiu states: Speech conveys principle; writing records speech. Since principle is boundless, how can writing exhaust it?\n\nThe written passages in the scriptures are studied to achieve mutual understanding.\n\nXu states: The scriptures record their essential purport but do not detail every intricacy—thus they are not easily mastered. They require scholars to delve deeply, savor their flavor, trace their origins and ends, and observe their subtle threads to achieve mutual enlightenment.\n\nLiu states: The scriptures convey principle; grasping principle leads to mutual affirmation.\n\nYou must treasure this and inwardly contemplate it.\n\nLiu states: Preserve its teachings; ponder its principles.\n\nThe natural Dao does not make appointments with you.\n\nLiu states: The Dao spans past and present; those who diligently cultivate it attain it. Those who attain it comprehend it intuitively—it cannot be predetermined.\n\nOverjoyed, he bows twice and asks, \"How should one pursue learning?\"\n\nChongxuanzi states: As Laozi’s exhortation grows earnest, the disciple, filled with reverence, bows to receive it, hoping to follow it faithfully. He dares to ask: What method of learning aligns with the Dao?\n\n**Chapter Three: Cultivating Skillfully**\n\nLaozi says: One who skillfully practices the written arts must compose its text with care.\n\nXu states: *Wei* means to cultivate; *sui* means to stabilize. If a student wishes to cultivate the sacred scriptures and immortal teachings, preserving authenticity and contemplating the wondrous to act without acting, they must first calm the mind and settle the will, seeking the meaning of the text. Only after grasping its meaning can they cultivate skillfully; only through skillful cultivation can their work be accomplished.\n\nChongxuanzi states: When the text is refined, matters proceed smoothly; when matters proceed smoothly, principles become vast. When the text is concise, matters are precise; when matters are precise, principles become refined. Both vast and refined, one may be said to have mastered the text.\n\nOne who skillfully discusses and penetrates its affairs must thoroughly understand its words.\n\nChongxuanzi states: When the text is refined and vast, and the words are comprehensive and penetrating, the meaning of the scriptures is fully realized.\n\nExert yourself and practice diligently—you will attain the Dao.\n\nChongxuanzi states: Refined text and penetrating words, coupled with diligent effort and earnest study, are the steps to attaining the Dao.\n\nLiu states: Those who study the text master writing; those who understand words can discourse. Those who exert themselves and practice diligently attain the Dao. From this, we know the Dao can be learned.\n\nTo act rightly is to be without fault; rightness resides within itself.\n\nRenzizi states: In cultivating the right Dao, one learns what is not learned, does what is not done—there is no rightness to be righted, no fault to be faulted. Thus, to act rightly is to be without fault. Though the heart may not seek to be right, rightness naturally returns to it. Not embracing the crooked, the crooked departs of itself.\n\nRenzizi states: The crooked consists of external affairs and unnatural actions. Not engaging in improper deeds or burdensome pursuits—hence it is said the crooked departs of itself.\n\nThis is called \"acting without acting,\" and the Dao naturally assists.\n\nChongxuanzi states: When every thought is right, who would dare to be crooked? With rightness present, the crooked vanishes, and the true Dao aids—this is what is meant by \"acting without acting.\"\n\nRenzizi states: Without fault in rightness, rightness naturally attains. Not embracing the crooked, the crooked naturally departs. This is the natural Dao bringing blessings.\n\nOne who is not skillful in sacrifices causes ghosts and spirits to avoid them.\n\nLiu states: The crooked seek blessings through excessive sacrifices to ghosts and spirits, but ghosts and spirits detest their deceit and jealousy. The upright make no such requests, keeping a respectful distance and dwelling in humility—thus ghosts and spirits avoid them.\n\nNot laboring the spirits, one receives a mandate without limit.\n\nRenzizi states: Those who nurture life keep their bodies pure; those who cultivate the heart keep their spirits still. Stillness means no labor; purity means no defilement. Without labor or defilement, one’s body aligns with the Dao, and the Dao aligns with the body—life has no predetermined end.\n\nLiu states: Laboring the spirits and nurturing the form leads to birth and death; not laboring or nurturing, life extends naturally.\n\nWithout advancement or retreat, who can scheme against you?\n\nXu states: \"Building virtue as if stealing\" means no advancement; \"advancing the Dao as if retreating\" means no retreat. Harmonizing light without shining, blending with the dust without defilement—flowing with things, none recognize you. Thus, demons cannot test you, desires cannot sway you. With an empty and formless heart, who can scheme against you?",
      "overlap_context": "Those who know music distinguish tones through strings; those who practice the Dao distinguish its purport through words. Both are without form or color, subtle and wondrously profound. The heart understands, but the mouth cannot express it.\n\n**Renzizi’s note:** The heart knows the subtleties of sound, but the tongue is insufficient to convey them. The wisdom that embodies profound principle cannot be fully explored by shallow discourse. The Dao is deep and wondrous; those who know do not speak.",

      "translated_text": "Liu states: With no thought of profit or harm, where lies advancement or retreat? Following reason and yielding to fate—what need is there for scheming? To act for this is to attain this—is this not natural?\n\nXu states: \"This\" refers to this very thing. To act for this without acting, to engage in this without engagement—thus attaining the true Dao—how could this not be natural? Li states: This concludes the proper way. To act rightly is to return to rightness; to distance oneself from the perverse is to banish perversity. This is what it means to act for this and attain this. \"Is this not natural?\" means that this *is* natural.\n\nLiu states: The essence of gold and jade is not beautiful at any given time; the rightness of the perfected person is not enacted at any given time. Rejoicing, I bow my head—now I have heard the command.\n\nLiu states: Revering the Dao and honoring the master, one offers respect and receives instruction.\n\n**Chapter Four: Acting with Caution**\nLaozi states: Act with caution, treasure it in your heart.\n\nXu states: Be cautious of transgressing precepts and commandments, diligently practice the pure conduct. Treasure the Dao and esteem virtue, embrace authenticity and hold fast to the One.\n\nLiu states: Admonitions urge cultivation.\n\nI shall journey far, yet we shall meet without appointment.\n\nLiu states: Desiring to go to Jambudvīpa, those of the same resonance respond—how could this require an appointment? Yin Xi received the words with profound sincerity, then at the pass claimed illness, abandoned his position, and dwelled alone in a secluded chamber.\n\nLiu states: The paths of stillness and chaos diverge; affairs cannot be managed in both. Without forsaking fame and profit, seeking the Dao is truly difficult. With tranquil detachment, he pondered the Dao, his will steadfast in guarding the One.\n\nLi states: Free from desires, tranquil and detached—this is *tranquil detachment*. Doubts dispelled, the true remains—this is *pondering the Dao*. Emotions not drifting—thus \"steadfast will.\" The heart without discrimination—thus \"guarding the One.\"\n\nLiu states: Preserving wholeness without action.\n\nHe delved into the root of emptiness, dissecting the subtlest mysteries.\n\nLi states: *Emptiness* is the essence of the Dao. Here, Yin Xi pondered the essence of emptiness to its utmost, exhausting the source of the root. *The subtlest mysteries* refer to the wondrous principle. *Yi* (乙) signifies \"one,\" *mi* (密) signifies \"subtle.\" The wondrous principle is singular; the heart of the Dao is only subtle. When one comprehends and distinguishes it, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature—this is what is meant by \"dissecting the subtlest mysteries.\"\n\nWei states: Though he wove the most wondrous words to respond to Wei Boyang, his heart remained serene, never uttering a word—thus \"the inner intent does not emerge.\"\n\nLi states: *Wondrous words* are the profound teachings. *Observing* (戳) encompasses all that is vast; *weaving* (缕) penetrates all that is minute. Exploring the great Dao, exhausting the profound and subtle, elucidating this mysterious origin, and penetrating the root of these teachings—devoted solely to the Dharma, without extraneous thoughts—thus \"the inner intent does not emerge.\"\n\nLiu states: *The subtlest mysteries* are like the most hidden and secret. Probing the profound words, inwardly one clarifies and illuminates, without expending spirit and thought in external pursuit.\n\nReciting the text ten thousand times, his sincerity and contemplation pierced through.\n\nXu states: *Refinement* is the utmost of subtlety; *sincerity* is the depth of truth; *piercing* is penetration. Here, Guan Yin recited the scripture ten thousand times, exhausting the most refined principles, deepening his true sincerity, and penetrating the mysteries of the void with his contemplation.\n\nAccording to the *True Records*, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: \"Recite the *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Virtue* ten thousand times, and the cloud chariot will come to welcome you.\" Judging by this, is it only that the scripture is distant and wondrous? It is also through the piercing of sincerity and contemplation that one can summon the cloud chariots and feathered canopies.\n\nLi states: Accumulating merit through the teachings, awakening to the profound through principle—this does not come from carelessness but must arise from sincerity. Principle and teaching are mirrored in emptiness; when the boundaries of wisdom are unobstructed, illumination penetrates all—thus \"sincerity and contemplation pierce through.\"\n\nCultivating authenticity to refine the body, one can penetrate the mysteries.\n\nXu states: Practicing true simplicity to refine the body, the radiance of essence abides—thus one can penetrate the mysterious and reach the wondrous.\n\nDiscoursing on the source of the ultimate, one can attain immortality.\n\nChong states: This describes how Guan Yin, after receiving the Dao from Laozi, devoted himself to its cultivation with sincerity. Claiming illness, he withdrew from the world, abandoned glory and rank, and with a heart stilled in an empty chamber, his will was wholly directed toward the true. Taking tranquil detachment as the pivot of the Dao and emptiness as its dwelling, he cultivated in secret, delving into the profound and exhausting the subtle. Studying and reciting the two scriptures with a devotion surpassing ten thousand repetitions, he ultimately penetrated the source and grasped the essentials, attaining long life and immortality. He ascended to the rank of Master Wen Shi and attained the position of the Supreme Perfected One.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Image of the Dao**\nLaozi states: The image of the Dao has no form or end; it is indistinct, seemingly absent yet present.\n\nWei states: It cannot be seen—thus \"no form\"; it cannot be grasped—thus \"no end.\" *Indistinct* refers to the absence of signs in its transformations. If one says it is absent, the ten thousand images are bounded by it; if one says it is present, its stillness and silence cannot be perceived—thus \"seemingly absent yet present.\"\n\nXu states: *Image* is pattern, semblance. The Dao takes spirit and qi as its essence. Though it has patterns and images, they resemble form yet are formless—only luminous traces and radiant semblances, upright and proper, yet without shape or thing. Seemingly present yet absent, seemingly absent yet present—thus \"indistinct, seemingly absent yet present.\"\n\nIt is like a seed before it sprouts, when branches, leaves, and roots are not yet seen.\n\nXu states: When a tree has not yet sprouted, its branches, leaves, roots, and stems are unseen—just as when the image of the Dao is not yet manifest, it is dark and empty.\n\nLiu states: Though the branches and leaves are not yet seen, one cannot say it is absent; though the Dao has no image, one cannot say it is not present.\n\nIt unites earth, water, fire, and wind; the four seasons pass in cycles.\n\nXu states: The four great elements unite to form the tree; the four seasons come and go—thus there is growth, decay, gathering, and dispersal.\n\nIt is like the union of spirit and qi, which transforms to form the image of the Dao. If the Mysterious One has not returned, and its pervasion is incomplete, there will be departures and reunions.\n\nQi is the life-giving earth; when gathered and congealed, it gradually solidifies.\n\nChong states: Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, the myriad spirits and beings—all receive the soft and harmonious qi of the Dao to form their solid and great essences. This gradual accumulation and gathering is not the work of a single day.",

      "translated_text": "Li states: Life arises from qi, thus qi is called \"life.\" When earth first congeals, it remains fragile; only after long accumulation does it become firm—this is what is meant by \"form already great.\"\n\nFlavors differ, forms are unequal:\nSweet, bitter, pungent, salty, sour.\n\nChong states: From the five phases arise the five flavors; from the five elements arise the five spirits. Spirits nourish internally, flavors sustain externally. The five phases wax and wane, thus they are not equal; the five qi transform and change, thus they do not flourish simultaneously. If one can embody and circulate them, draw upon and nurture them, one ascends to the life of the superior person.\n\nQi moves in greater or lesser measure; strength and weakness are indeed unequal.\n\nWei states: When all beings first receive qi, its purity and coarseness vary; natures and dispositions differ, hence strength, weakness, abundance, and scarcity are not uniform.\n\nLiu states: All things that move or grow take qi as the root of their beginning. Yet when they reach fullness and grandeur, their natures and qualities differ, and the movement of qi is also partial—what they receive is inherently distinct.\n\nThough they emerge from the same source, names and colors differ, each generating its own intent and cause.\n\nChong states: When qi generates one another, they all draw from the Dao. Yet according to what they receive, names and colors vary. Good and evil, strength and weakness follow the same principle. What the heart generates is called \"intent\"; what perception receives is called \"cause.\"\n\nLi states: All draw from the Dao and receive from qi, thus it is said they emerge from the same source. Yet names and lineages differ, colors and kinds vary—thus it is said names and colors differ. Those whose hearts are pure are upright and good; those whose perceptions are turbid are perverse and evil. Conduct differs, aspirations and natures vary—thus each generates its own intent and cause.\n\nLiu states: All that has life emerges from the Dao. Yet names and titles differ, patterns and hues vary. Like gathers with like, kinds separate—intent and cause differ accordingly.\n\nFrom these differing natures and conducts, they receive bodily forms.\n\nLi states: Since natures differ, conduct also varies. Whether good or evil, the blessings they receive follow their forms—flowing through the six paths, dying and being reborn.\n\nThey contain and nurture the Dao of yin and yang, relying upon and depending on it as kin.\n\n*(Note: 倚 is also written as 寄.)*\n\nWei states: Once contained by yin and yang, they receive their bodies through the harmony of conception. Yet beings, deluded and confused, do not know they emerge from the same Dao. Thus, following what they depend upon, each takes its own as kin.\n\nLiu states: From those of middling wisdom downward, even to insects, all receive their forms by dependence and take them as kin. Thus *Zhuangzi* says: \"Once receiving its form, it does not forget until its end.\"\n\nThe Way of life is not of one kind; all people are not the same.\n\nLi states: The Way of generation and transformation is manifold. What is called \"human\" in one case is called \"non-human\" in another. The ten thousand kinds differ—thus they are not of one kind.\n\nXu states: The transformations of yin and yang are called the \"Way of life\"; the harmony of the two qi is called the \"power of life.\" What virtue generates, the Dao transforms. The ten thousand things, the ten thousand forms—kinds and types are not singular. All plants and beings, human and non-human, all receive from virtue and the Dao before they are born and take form.\n\nOriginally emerging from the Void Origin, through resonance and stimulation, spirit is born.\n\nXu states: The Void Origin is the Dao. It is said that the generation and transformation of beings and things all emerge from the Dao. When essence and qi harmonize and resonate with one another, spirit is born. Spirit congeals and transforms into the human body’s gods—this illustrates how the Void can generate the solid, and the Origin can generate existence.\n\nChong states: The vastness of heaven and earth, the abundance of the ten thousand kinds—moving and still, their forms differ; flying and sinking, their tendencies vary. Yet all transform from the Origin into existence, receive life from the Dao. Accumulated qi becomes spirit, all sharing the root of transformation.\n\nIt is like one who plucks a string: the hand moves, and the sound is transmitted.\n\nLiu states: The string originally has no sound; only when struck does it become music. Just as the Void Origin is fundamentally quiescent, only through resonance and stimulation is spirit born.\n\nGong, shang, jue, zhi, yu—\nThe breath of the mouth, the origin of exhalation and inhalation.\n\nLi states: 攘 means \"to pluck.\" The hand plucks the string, and sound begins to emit. The mouth exhales and inhales qi, and voice begins to resound. Without the mouth’s origin, there would be no sound; only through the string can vibration occur. Thus we know the mouth is the root of sound, the hand the origin of tone.\n\nExtending this to things, without the Dao, they cannot be born.\n\n*(Strings refer to zither, se, zheng, and zhu;\nWinds refer to xiao, di, songs, and chants—this is the analogy being drawn.)*\n\nBody, mouth, and intent are the roots; the Dao emerges as the supreme origin.\n\nOriginally quiescent in emptiness and stillness—thus the Dao is spontaneous.\n\nLi states: As soon as there is life, body, mouth, and intent are possessed. From where do body, mouth, and intent arise? They must derive from the Dao as their origin. Thus it is said the Dao emerges as the supreme origin—this completes the analogy.\n\nChong states: The breath of the mouth, the movements of the body—all arise from the operation of intent. Intent is spirit; what generates spirit is the Dao. When intent is clear and pure, without action, spirit is at peace and accords with the Dao. When intent is restless and competitive, with desires, spirit is lost and life is harmed. Only by concentrating the heart in emptiness and stillness can one unite with the Dao of spontaneity.\n\nLiu states: The body’s intent is fundamentally pure, without any defilements. Tracing its source, it is the natural nature of the Dao.\n\nThe five notes stir and shake, then become entangled with music and color.\n\nChong states: When the five notes are hidden in profound silence, one embodies the Dao in tranquility and joy. When the five notes flow through the pitch pipes, they move things to sorrow and happiness—this illustrates how simplicity scatters into vessels, purity dissipates into shallowness.\n\nLi states: Earlier, the spontaneous Dao was shown to be fundamentally pure and still, without seeing or hearing, neither color nor sound—this is the profound source, the wondrous root of the utmost mystery. Now it speaks of life after birth, following desires and indulging emotions, losing the principle of emptiness and stillness, forsaking the spontaneous Dao. Hearing the stirring of the five notes, the ear becomes attached; seeing the blue and yellow of the five colors, the eye becomes fixated. Enmeshed in the delusions of action, they are detained by sound and color.\n\nScattering yang to become brightness, spreading qi to form the six senses.",

and show them this,\nurging them to honor the root,\nshedding these encumbrances\nto enter that natural state.\n\nAs for the birth of the ten thousand things,\nemotions and actions entwine.\nChong [Xuanzi] says:\nThe wondrous root of life-transformation is the Dao of naturalness,\nthe father and mother of the ten thousand things,\nthe primordial origin of Heaven and Earth.\nI wish for Guan Yin to revere and honor it,\nand so repeat this admonition.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nEmotions arise within, actions manifest without,\nentangled and bound—how could they merely be \"entwined\"?\nAs destruction gives way to completion,\nas extinction gives way to rebirth.\nLi [Rong] says:\nBy causes revolving, going and returning without cease,\nas destruction yields completion, death here gives birth there,\nas extinction yields rebirth, emerging from darkness into light.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nThis is destroyed, that is completed;\nthat is extinguished, this is born.\nThus the Five Phases form,\nyin and yang conjoined.\nXu [Daomiao] says:\nThe Four Qi divide and reign, forming the Five Phases.\nThe Five Phases mutually engender and destroy,\nmutually destroy and complete.\nWhen yin conjoins, there is extinction and destruction;\nwhen yang conjoins, there is birth and completion.\nChong [Xuanzi] says:\nThe Five Phases differ, yet the Dao’s radiance is one;\nyin and yang diverge, yet the Dao’s radiance is impartial.\nThe Five Phases have extinction and birth—\nlike the alternation of spring and autumn;\nyin and yang have completion and destruction—\nlike the shifting of kalpas.\nThe Dao resides between the Five Phases and the Two Qi,\nunchanging in its oneness,\nand thus becomes the master of the Five Phases and the Two Qi,\nabiding eternally.\n\nRevolving and transforming,\nthey become the essence of things.\nWei [Chuxuan] says:\nThe Five Phases rise and fall in turn,\nyin and yang come and go—\njust as in the human realm,\none dies and one is born.\nTransforming and revolving,\nthe essence of things never ceases.\n\nI ponder this Dao,\nits root emerging from the profound and obscure.\nLi [Rong] says:\nThis Dao is the Dao of life, death, and transformation.\nThings, being obstructed, have exhausted their use,\nyet by relying on the Dao, they attain passage.\nOnly then can stagnation be dispelled.\nIts root emerges from the Dao,\nyet the Dao is beyond thought and discussion,\nboundless and unfathomable,\nindivisible and ineffable.\nI borrow the term \"profound and obscure\"—\nit is not truly profound and obscure.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nAll arise from the formless.\nThe foolish do not discern or know,\nclaiming they are simply born.\nChong [Xuanzi] says:\nThe Dao’s origin is without beginning,\nprofound and distant,\nthe root of the ten thousand things.\nThe birth of the ten thousand things\nall receives the Dao’s radiance.\nAt its root, the radiance is singular;\nthings obtain it and are born.\nThe foolish do not know,\nbelieving they are not born of the Dao.\nLi [Rong] says:\nThe foolish, lacking knowledge,\nsay they are simply born of themselves,\nnot of the Dao—\nthis is delusion from the root.\nYou lack the Dao-eye,\nhow can you know the birth of spirits?\nWei [Chuxuan] says:\nThis clarifies that the Dao of life, death, and transformation\nemerges from the profound and obscure,\ndeep and

ghosts and spirits obtain the One to become numinous?\nLi [Rong] says:\nThe Dao-eye sees beyond the formless,\nilluminating the subtle and obscure.\n\"Humans\" refers to the numinous among the living.\nThe deluded, far from knowing the Dao,\ncannot even know themselves.\nThus I say: You lack the Dao-eye,\nhow can you know the birth of spirits?\nAs the saying goes: He who knows others is wise;\nhe who knows himself is enlightened.\nOnly such a one is truly wise and clear,\nknowing all without exception.\n\nHeaven and Earth, humans and things—\nall fill the vast and empty primordial sack.\nXu [Daomiao] says:\nThe Two Modes and the ten thousand things\nare all born within the vast and empty primordial sack,\nfilling the cosmos.\nChong [Xuanzi] says:\nThe Dao’s radiance pervades

the myriad kinds,\ngreat and small, foolish and wise—\nnone arise of themselves or transform alone.\nAll fundamentally emerge from the empty and primordial,\nborn of the Dao together—\nthus they are \"the same.\"\nYet their natures differ and their names vary—\nthus they are \"different.\"\nThe abandoned bellows is but a metaphor:\nfrom the bellows emerges qi,\nfrom the flute emerges sound,\nfrom the empty and primordial emerge the ten thousand images.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nThough blown in myriad ways, their names differ.\n\nThis too is fundamentally not so—\nit depends on proper use.\nLiu [Qihui] states:\nAffairs have reversal and compliance,\nprinciples have flexibility and constancy.\nRight and wrong are not fixed.\nThose who cling to them\nmay sometimes stop when it is time to

      "translated_text": "Li [Yue] says:\nAll people turn from black toward white, emerging from darkness into light. Yet here it speaks of \"not treading the path of excessive brightness\"—what profound meaning lies therein? Excessive brightness defies convention, and convention thus resents it. Only by blending with the turbid may one attain the subtle wonder of enduring existence—its marvel resides precisely here.\n\nThe bond of father and child is deep, yet not sufficient to heed one another.\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe duty between master and disciple is weighty, the affection between father and child profound. When a child errs, he must follow his father’s rightness; when a younger brother strays, he must adhere to his teacher’s goodness. Thus, one honors them as master and father, valuing their instruction and heeding their admonitions.\n\nDo not clamor or clamor with indignation.\nMocked by those near and far.\nLi [Yue] says:\n\"Clamor\" refers to arrogance and strident noise. A disloyal younger brother, an unfilial son—one who defies his father’s command, rejects his teacher’s decree, rebels against his superiors, and forsakes the rites of youth—becomes the laughingstock of others. The admonition \"do not\" warns against such conduct.\n\nConcealing evil and extolling good is what the noble person reveres.\nXu [Yue] says:\n\"Reveres\" means to esteem. When evil is extolled, evil hides; when good is extolled, good becomes known. Thus, the noble person esteems this.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Deviance and Rectitude**\nLaozi says:\nDeviant and upright teachings all respond to nature.\nThus, misfortune and fortune arise from the roots one sows.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nThose who plant upright roots are naturally upright; those who plant deviant roots are naturally deviant. The deviant bring misfortune upon themselves; the upright bring fortune upon themselves—is this not nature’s response?\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe human heart harbors both resistance and compliance, and conduct thus encompasses both good and evil. As one’s own actions are, so too are the teachings one imparts. The magnanimous noble person instructs others in uprightness—hence \"upright teachings.\" The envious petty person teaches others to deviate—hence \"deviant teachings.\" In deviance, though one may not seek it, deviance comes of itself; in uprightness, though one may seek it, uprightness comes of itself. Such is the response—deviance is repaid with misfortune, uprightness with fortune. The correspondence of good and evil is never indiscriminate; retribution is never amiss. It is like planting seeds—each root yields its distinct fruit, clearly differentiated.\n\nAs one receives, so one’s seed and kernel become manifest.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nHaving received this life, one receives this form. Good and evil, fortune and misfortune follow one’s conduct, just as grasses and trees grow, each distinct according to its seed and kernel.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nUpright and deviant conduct stand before us; fortune and misfortune respond thereafter. Only when signs appear and effects become evident does one recognize the cause—thus it is said, \"As one receives, so one’s seed and kernel become manifest.\"\n\nHere the Way diverges, and words distinguish the false from the true.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nThe essence of the Way is vast and all-pervading, originally without true or false. The rise of true and false stems from teachings. The false Way nurtures form; the true Way nurtures spirit.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nActions that accord with principle are upright; those that contravene truth are deviant. Deviance is empty and false—hence \"false.\" Uprightness is ultimate—hence \"true.\" The true enters the subtle and thus nurtures spirit; the false is feeble and thus nurtures form. To nurture form means to fill the body with rich flavors; to nurture spirit means to cultivate the heart with purity.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nThose who act and desire nurture form; those who are without action and desire nurture spirit. Those who nurture form become ash and earth; those who nurture spirit can vanish and endure.\n\nThe true spirit communes with the Dao, able to vanish and endure.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nForm cannot be preserved; to preserve it through desire is thus \"false.\" To nurture spirit through non-action is to respond with serene resonance—hence \"true.\" In this state, death and life are equal in measure, existence and nonexistence alike in continuity. Thus, not to cling to existence is to be able to vanish; not to reject nonexistence is to be able to endure.\n\nXu [Yue] says:\nSpirit communes with the Dao, transforming endlessly, able to die and live, to vanish and endure.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nSerene and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating—all fetters dissolved, free in coming and going. Spirit can make form take flight and even move mountains.\nWei [Zheng] says:\nOnly spirit—swift without haste, arriving without traveling—what can it not do? Thus it can make form take flight and move mountains.\n\nForm becomes ash and earth—what awareness remains?\nLi [Yue] says:\nForm, in life, is substantial and obstructive, inherently without knowledge. In death, it becomes ash and earth—what awareness can remain?\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nThough one may nurture it abundantly, it ultimately becomes ash and earth. Since the matter is not empty, why indulge excessively?\n\nEars and eyes, sounds and colors—these ensnare the child.\nWhat the nose and mouth favor—fragrance and flavor—are foes.\nThe body is the root of affliction, tormented by pain, itching, cold, and heat.\nLi [Yue] says:\nHaving a body and breath, one is not only troubled by sounds and colors but also afflicted by fragrance and flavor, pain and itching, cold and heat—all are the root of affliction.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nSounds and colors destroy life; rich flavors cause illness. The body that depends on conditions is never at ease.\n\nThe mind schemes for the body, bringing sorrow, poison, worry, and vexation.\nI am bound by the body—knowing it to be the great calamity.\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe body is tormented by cold and heat; the heart is poisoned by sorrow and worry. Only when both heart and body are at rest can this cease. How is this achieved? One must forget the body externally and extinguish the heart internally. When body and heart are both forgotten, what affliction remains? This urges the abandonment of deliberate action.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nTo externalize the body is to be without sorrow, yet it remains akin to being burdened.\n\nObserve the ancients, regard the present—who can preserve their form intact?\nLi [Yue] says:\nGazing upon the distant past, observing the present—all are swept along by transformation, succeeded by yin and yang. Who remains whole and preserved?\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nPeng Zu and the short-lived child alike perish—how much more so the mediocre? Even I, now white-haired, know not which year will bring old age and decline.",

      "translated_text": "Li [Yue] says:\nEven the Old Lord, who descended as a divine manifestation, still showed signs of aging, his hair grown white. How much more so for those mired in the vulgar world, buffeted by the myriad conditions of cold and heat, prosperity and decline, ceaselessly shifting and transforming—how could they attain longevity? Aging spares no year. I originally abandoned the worldly, weary of this defiled realm.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe profusion of deliberate action, the filth and leakage of the human realm—these are not worth preserving. Weary of them, I cast them aside. Embracing the primordial and guarding the One, I traverse the path to divine transcendence.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe \"primordial One\" is the Dao. To cherish the Dao and embrace virtue, to preserve the unity of the Three Characters—this is to rank among the highest sages and ultimately ascend as a radiant immortal. Yet you have not been able to guard it, instead sitting amidst the glory of office.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nHe has not been able to guard the One. Even the Gatekeeper, while in office, was still called \"glorious official\"—how much less could those dazzled by worldly emoluments ever attain the true Dao? If you can remain unmoved, your spirit will find peace.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nNot swayed by external things, the spirit remains serene and at ease. If you can relinquish desire, every undertaking will be complete.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nOne without desire finds all affairs in accord. If you can practice non-action, your resolve is known to be firm.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nTo uphold resolve through non-action requires unwavering discipline—without it, success is unattainable. Now I speak to you plainly, laying bare the exposition. Dispersing doubts and dissecting distinctions, truth and falsehood are clearly separated.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\n\"Laying bare\" means to reveal openly; \"exposition\" means to expound at length. \"Dispersing doubts\" means to clarify; \"dissecting distinctions\" means to adjudicate. Indulging the passions is false; relinquishing desire is true. Considering those lost in confusion, unable to attain profound awakening, I therefore explain with utmost clarity, that you may discern good from evil. You must receive this earnestly, revering the Dao with devotion.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nThe Dao is noble, its virtue precious—it must not be treated lightly. Where faith is insufficient, disbelief arises; thus, devotion is required. The Dao is the light that emerges; the scriptures are the first step in learning.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe benighted do not understand; only those who seek true illumination can begin to cultivate the Dao. The Dao is not attained in isolation—it must be realized through the scriptures. Thus, to grasp the principles of entering the Dao, the scriptures must come first in study.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nWithout illumination, the Dao cannot be perceived; without scriptures, there is nothing to rely upon. Bestowed upon those who can practice it, it makes no distinction between rich and poor. Its teachings and transformations are offered with joy, without partiality or favor.\n\nWei [Yue] says:\nTo those whose hearts can practice the Dao, the Dao itself emerges to bestow it. To those who delight in studying the scriptures, the scriptures themselves reveal their teachings—how could it discriminate between poverty and wealth, closeness and distance?\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe Dao makes no distinctions. It does not bar the poor nor obstruct the distant; it does not withhold teaching due to kinship or estrangement. Its essence lies in practice and in heeding its transformations. Bestowed upon those who can practice it, its texts are given to those worthy of them.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\nThe sage responds with emptiness, aligning with the moment’s need. Without faith, there is no practice—how then could teaching or bestowal occur? The key lies in steadfast devotion to the Dharma; only then are the sacred texts conferred.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nThe utmost impartiality. Learn from my teaching, and you will not lose the true Dao.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\n\"Er\" means \"you.\" I teach you, and you should learn—only then can you succeed, not losing the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Heaven and Earth**\nThe Old Master says:\nHeaven, earth, and all beings originate from the primordial Dao.\n\nChong [Yue] says:\nThis speaks of the Two Modes and all beings—all arise from the primordial qi of the Dao. Together they emerge from the Great Simplicity, the inception of the Void and Primordial.\n\nLi [Yue] says:\n\"Primordial\" means root and origin. \"Great Simplicity\" is the pure, unblemished Dao; \"Void and Primordial\" is the profound mystery beyond being. Though the Three Powers are vast and the myriad things numerous, none do not take the pure and tranquil Dao as their root, the profound and wondrous principle as their origin. Without the Dao as their beginning, things could not be born—all are alike in this, hence it is said they \"emerge together.\"\n\nThe dim radiance of semblance, the supreme mystery of the subtlest.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nThe \"Great Simplicity\" is the initial substance of qi. It is said that heaven, earth, and the myriad things take the Dao as their origin, emerging from the inception of the Great Simplicity and entering the gateway of the Void and Non-being. Once the myriad things manifest their substance, their dim radiance becomes semblance—this is the subtle and wondrous essence.\n\nIt is like a chasm a thousand miles deep, where a faint-flowing spring lies below. Gazing upon it, the water seems turbid and shallow—how could one see through to the sand at the bottom?\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nThe Dao is only subtle and obscure, difficult to perceive or witness. Using things as metaphors opens the understanding of sentient beings. A chasm ten thousand miles deep—yet the eye can only see a few fathoms. If even the water cannot be fully seen, how could one claim to see the bottom? Water has form and substance, yet its clarity remains unseen—how much less could the formless Dao, silent and dark, be known?\n\nDark and dim, it is unknown whence it arises. It is also like the departed dead, whose spirit is no longer seen.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nEntering the spirit through profound meaning to put it to use, employing it to secure the self and exalt virtue—beyond this, none can know. This saying is true indeed! Moreover, the soul and qi pervade all places, yet even they cannot be seen after departing—how much less the dark and unfathomable Dao, which defies all knowledge of its origin?\n\nPure yin harmonizes and coalesces, yet its manifestations cannot be distinctly perceived.\n\nLiu [Yue] says:\nYang is life; yin is death. The dead have no yang, hence it is called \"pure yin.\" Though the harmonized coalescence possesses the power of yang’s function, it can no longer be clearly known.\n\nThe past and the just-arrived, seen as if before one’s eyes—yet even these cannot be fully understood. How then could one know what is lost or preserved?\n\nWei [Yue] says:\n\"Just-arrived\" means \"just beginning.\" The past and the just-beginning are like things seen before one’s eyes—yet even these the foolish cannot fully comprehend. How much less the dark and subtle Dao, which seems to exist yet not exist, could they ever recognize?\n\nLi [Yue] says:\n\"Past\" is what has gone; \"just-arrived\" is what has not yet come. \"Seen before one’s eyes\" is the present. With the divine eye, one sees future events; with the knowledge of past lives, one knows past dharmas; with the exhaustion of outflows, one knows the present state.

      "translated_text": "Just as one afflicted with a throat ulcer cannot convey speech to others—\n\nXu says: The subtle mechanism of the Dao cannot be expressed in words. Though the mind may grasp its meaning, the mouth cannot utter it. Like one suffering from a throat ulcer, who cannot even transmit speech, how could they discourse on the wondrous Dao?\n\nLiu says: The mute cannot convey words, just as the blind cannot perceive the Dao.\n\nTo play the notes of *gong* and *shang* for the deaf—how could they hear?\n\nLiu says: The deluded hearing the supreme Dao is like the deaf listening to *gong* and *shang*.\n\nOnly those of partial wit possess such intelligence, receiving instruction as if by direct transmission. Yet they claim to comprehend the Dao’s essence—though their innermost feelings cannot be refined.\n\n*(Variant in Li and Liu: \"claim to grasp its discourse, though their coarse nature cannot express it.\")*\n\nLi says: Only the eloquent can transmit words, and only the wise can expound the Dharma. The inarticulate may claim to convey its discourse, yet their vulgar and shallow understanding cannot truly express it. The dull-witted may profess mastery of profound teachings, yet their benighted minds remain obscure to the ultimate principle.\n\nThus they lose the root of life—how then could they fathom the origin of the Dao?\n\nLi says: Understanding the Dao’s affairs depends on the Dharma; discerning the root of life relies on wisdom. Without wisdom, one loses the root of life; with a benighted mind, how could one grasp the Dao’s origin? Hence those mired in the mundane are many, while those who return to the Dao are few.\n\nLiu says: Claiming to comprehend principle through transmitted teachings, they remain unaware of their own coarseness and ignorance, losing the profound source. Having lost the profound source, they forfeit the root of life; having forfeited the root of life, how could they know the Dao’s origin?\n\n**Chapter on Practicing the Dao**\n\nLaozi says: If you practice my Dao, you must know the origin of supreme wisdom. Wisdom does not arise alone—it always requires corresponding causes and conditions.\n\nLi says: Wisdom illuminates existence, while wisdom discerns emptiness. When both illuminate together, no principle remains obscure—hence the name \"wisdom.\" Yet the origin of wisdom is profoundly penetrating, and the root of wisdom is difficult to exhaust. To exhaust it, one must rely on an enlightened teacher; without the proper causes and conditions, wisdom will not arise.\n\nLiu says: One who understands the Dao is called \"supreme wisdom.\" Wisdom has no inherent good or evil—it arises only through conditions.\n\nEach possesses the root of past conduct, which determines destiny and fortune.\n\nLiu says: Worthiness or foolishness, nobility or baseness, wealth or poverty, long life or early death—all stem from the root of past conduct, with destiny and fortune governing their fruition.\n\nThose who share the Dao attain it; those who share virtue possess its root.\n\nLi says: The differences between foolishness and wisdom, brightness and darkness, nobility and baseness, good and evil all arise from past conduct and depend on past lives. Destiny may be long or short, fortune abundant or meager—all are recorded in former times and receive their retribution in the present. Thus, the good, sharing the Dao, attain it; sharing virtue, they gain its root. The wicked, not sharing the Dao, lose it; not sharing virtue, they lose its root.\n\nLiu says: Retribution is never in error.\n\nIf in past lives one did not study and inquire, in this life one remains close to the worldly.\n\nThus, in gain and loss, they take no joy in the Dao’s texts.\n\nLi says: In former lives, they did not delight in scriptures and Dharma—this is what it means to have not studied and inquired in past lives. In this life, lacking good teachers and virtuous friends, they fail to draw near to goodness and wisdom, like one facing a wall, ever colliding with obstacles. Truly, such fools take no joy in scriptures and texts—hence it is said: \"Thus, in gain and loss, they take no joy in the Dao’s texts.\"\n\nLiu says: Those who share in loss also delight in gain. Silk, without constant dyeing, becomes habitual through repeated exposure. Teaching knows no distinctions; accumulated practice becomes nature. If in past lives one did not study the true, how could one now aspire to the Dao? They toil their whole lives, ever close to loss.\n\nGreedy for desire, seeking profit and glory, they accept offerings and remember favors with diligence. Further bestowing wealth to deepen bonds, they do not pity the poor and destitute below.\n\nLi says: Those who share in the highest virtue are originally empty and primal, but having lost the supreme Dao, they generate much defilement. Taking glory and honor as profit, they pursue nobility and rank; regarding wealth and favors as kindness, they exchange mutual visits. They call this \"deepening bonds,\" yet show no compassion for the poor and needy—how could they have loyalty to return to the true and turn toward the Dao?\n\nLiu says: To take pride in the orphaned and pity the poor is what the common people scorn but the sage values.\n\nThey must endure much anger and suffering, with no place to settle their origin.\n\nXu says: *Chu* means \"to dwell\"; *yuan* means \"origin,\" referring to the mind. When the mind is bound to glory and profit, and emotions cling to fame and substance, fear of disgrace and honor disturbs their harmony like ice and fire. With much anger and restless emotions, their nature becomes unruly, their will and conduct inconstant—there is no place to settle their mind.\n\nWithout a bright teacher to study under, how could they resolve doubts and difficulties?\n\nLi says: When doubts remain unresolved and mysteries unpenetrated, one must rely on a bright teacher to attain awakening. To remain foolish until death makes true liberation difficult.\n\nLiu says: Those lost on the Dao follow divergent paths, with none to guide their return. The awakened are hard to encounter, and the discerning are rare. If the teacher is deluded, how can they resolve confusion? If confusion is not resolved, even broad learning is not true understanding.\n\nThus the *Book of Rites* says: \"Learning by rote memorization is insufficient to be a teacher of others.\"\n\nMy Dao is like a single hair—who could clearly distinguish it?\n\nLi says: Without innate wisdom within and lacking a skillful teacher without, they cannot even distinguish a hair, let alone know the origin of the great Dao. Without study, how could they understand?\n\nLiu says: It speaks of its subtlety and difficulty to comprehend.\n\nFrom the beginning of past ages, the wondrous things experienced are as numerous as grains of sand and dust.\n\nXu says: *Geng* means \"to pass through.\" Since Lord Lao opened the cosmos, within the primordial chaos—vast and boundless—countless kalpas have elapsed. Records do not preserve them, and the kalpas passed through are as numerous as sand and dust, truly beyond calculation or analogy.\n\nWith every movement, a kalpa is recorded—how arduous and toilsome I consider it!\n\nXu says: *Zai* means \"year.\" Since the beginning of creation, every cycle of death and rebirth has spanned kalpas, beyond reckoning or record. I reflect on my journeys through the eight dark realms, dwelling in mountains and seas, treading through wars and fires, traversing winds and dust, teaching and transforming beings—difficult to fully recount, how arduous and toilsome it has been!",

      "translated_text": "**Fascicle Three of the *Collected Commentaries on the* Scripture of Western Ascension**\n**Ren Zhen Zi: Li Rong**\n**Liu Huahui (Annotations)**\n**Bi Xu Zi (Compilation)**\n\n**Chapter Ten: Repeated Admonition**\n\nThe Old Master said: I admonish you again—you must receive this with careful attention.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** The true Dao is difficult to clarify, hence the repeated admonition. One ought to examine it thoroughly and receive it with reverence.\n\nThe Dao holds non-action as supreme; virtue takes benevolence as its master.\n\n**Chong [Xuan Zi]:** The Great Void is the supreme Dao; supreme benevolence is the master of the five virtues.\n\n**Wei [Chuxuan]:** The Dao has no form—it acts through non-action and yet accomplishes all. Thus, it stands as the foremost of heaven, earth, and all beings. When things become manifest, they lose their flow; attaining the Dao restores their flow. Hence, virtue connects to the manifest. When beings fail to obtain, one bestows upon them so they may receive—thus, benevolence is proclaimed in the chapter on \"Supreme Benevolence,\" which takes virtue as its master.\n\n**Liu [Huahui]:** To grant beings existence within the void is the Dao; to nurture their nature is virtue.\n\nRites take righteousness as humility; bestowal takes kindness as friendship. Kindness takes benefit as its priority; trust takes efficacy as its foundation.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** If you wish to practice the Dao, hold non-action as supreme—for action is not the Dao. If you wish to establish virtue, take transformative compassion as its master—for harm and killing are not virtue. In cultivating the rites of bowing and turning, one must adhere to proper conduct and humility—without righteousness and humility, there are no rites. In bestowing broadly, one should elevate kindness, taking it as the bond of friendship—for without friendship in kindness, there is no bestowal. In preserving kindness, let benefit to others come first—for kindness that does not benefit others is no kindness. In treading the path of trust, let there be tangible proof—for if it is merely in name without substance, empty and ineffectual, it is not trust. One who can practice these may perfect the Dao.\n\nThe degenerate world also possesses these, though they exist to entice one another.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** The customs of the Dao and virtue are absent, while the transformations of benevolence and righteousness prevail everywhere. Yet, as customs vary between purity and turbidity, and governance wavers between success and failure, those who practice these possess all six virtues, while those who abandon them fail even in one aspect of the Dao. In this age of falsity and shallowness, they too speak of possessing the Dao and virtue, of being replete in benevolence and righteousness—but they cannot put them into true use. They feign empty conduct to deceive and lure one another, lacking genuine trust.\n\n**Liu [Huahui]:** As for the six matters above, the degenerate world also practices them—but only to seek advantage through mutual enticement, not to practice the Dao for the benefit of beings.\n\nThus, one knows the world is thin, adorning itself with embellishments to deceive one another.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** Without the substance of the Dao and virtue, they also lose the truth of benevolence and righteousness, possessing only hollow and superficial words to flatter and outshine one another.\n\n**Liu [Huahui]:** Observe their motives, examine their conduct—who can conceal the nature of their shallowness and embellishment?\n\nTheir words stand before the soaring dragon, yet their conduct lags behind the limping tortoise.\n\n**Wei [Chuxuan]:** In this degenerate world, they falsify benevolence and righteousness to seek profit, feign rites and trust to seek fame—possessing only the name without the reality. Thus, their words stand before the soaring dragon, yet their conduct lags behind the limping tortoise. They utter empty words, but their actions cannot match them.\n\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** The noble person of old spoke sparingly but acted swiftly; the petty person of today speaks hastily but acts slowly.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** Light promises and hasty words place their speech before the soaring dragon; lack of substance and scant trust leave their conduct behind the limping tortoise.\n\nBenevolence, righteousness, rites, and trust are abandoned; the Dao and virtue lie desolate, decayed, and ruined. They do not examine one another by the Dao but instead assist one another with wealth.\n\n**Wei [Chuxuan]:** They falsely claim the names of benevolence, righteousness, rites, and trust but lack their substance—hence, they are said to be abandoned. The world’s Dao has been lost for so long that it is now desolate, decayed, and ruined. *Ji* means to attain. Yet they cannot summon governance through the Dao but instead aid one another with cleverness and wealth.\n\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** *Ji* means to enlighten, to awaken; *fu* means to assist. They neglect true form, turn their backs on reality, and embrace falsity—such is the extremity of their shallowness and embellishment, reaching this state.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** *Ji* means to reach. They cannot practice virtue in coming and going, attaining one another through the Dao. Instead, they turn to wealth and goods to mutually benefit one another, their minds set on action.\n\nIt is like a reflection in a mirror—visible but not graspable. It is like an echo in a valley—how can the sound of the wind be woven together?",

      "translated_text": "The false teachings of the world are like this, so long have they led astray.\n\n*Xu* [means] to gather—Li, Liu, and the Li edition all write it as \"聚.\"\n**Wei [Yuan]:** The teachings of the former sages are like reflections in a mirror, echoes in sound: they come and go with concealment and revelation, yet the mirror remains ever still; they rise and fall with the voice, yet the echo remains ever constant. The deluded world clings to the sages’ responsive traces in things, distorting them to govern the world—how could they be grasped and woven together? Thus we know their delusion has endured for so long.\n**Li [Rong]:** The forms in a mirror are truly difficult to seize; the sounds within the wind are not easily gathered. Neither sound nor form can be taken or assembled.\n\nLight promises and hollow deeds, worldly undertakings—though one knows they bring no true benefit, the shallow customs remain sunk in confusion. Thus they distance themselves [from the Dao], and so it is said their delusion has endured for so long.\n\nAmong all beings under heaven, who alone is the constant master?\nDelusion is passed on in delusion, transmitted in turn from one to another.\n**Wei [Yuan]:** All things arise naturally, without any master to make them so. Yet the deluded claim the Dao can be transmitted to others, that spontaneity can be bestowed upon them—how profoundly confused they are!\n**Liu [Xiao]** The sage levels himself with the world, flowing with things. His spirit knows no death, his form follows transformation. His teachings are left to later generations, and the deluded pass them on, delusion begetting delusion—thus they turn endlessly.\n\nFalsehood invades the true; emptiness takes on the semblance of being.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** The benighted, failing to see clearly, are entered by falsehood. Cunning deception disrupts the true, appearing as if it were the Dao.\n\nUnable to distinguish the false from the true, they pursue profit and cling to it.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** Deluded teachers, unable to discern truth from falsehood, are bound by greed and desire, chasing worldly gain without return.\n\nIf one guards the self with this, who could call it lasting?\n**Li [Rong]:** Falsehood is action; entering the true is non-action. The deluded seek the true Dao through false paths, striving for non-action through action—how could they ever attain it? To consider this attainment is like mistaking an image in empty space for true existence.\n\nClinging to the falsity of action, failing to recognize the truth of non-action—how could this be so? It is only for the sake of greed, desire, and profit that they hold to this, thus losing the true Dao of non-action.\n\nThe unchanging and upright perish as well; the blind and foolish bear their own blame.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Clinging to falsehood and losing the true, the upright perishes as well. This is the doing of the blind and foolish—whom else could they blame?\n\nIt is like fire born from wood, which in turn burns the wood to ash.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Fire arises from wood and then consumes the wood itself. Falsehood arises from the self and then destroys the self.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Sage’s Words**\n**Laozi says:** The words of the sage declare that the Dao should be observed through its patterns.\nAs if there were something that gives birth—thus it is called spontaneity.\n**Wei [Yuan]:** What pattern should the Dao be observed by? Simply through no-pattern and no-observation, spontaneously merging into obscurity. As the *Daodejing* says: \"Always without desire, observe its mystery\"—this is what is meant.\nNow, what gives birth to what is born? It is not born through being born, but is born of itself—thus we know the Dao is spontaneous.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** All that has birth arises from the Dao.\n\nThe eyes see and the heart is moved; the mouth speaks for the heart.\nThe nose serves as the passage for wind and qi—nose and mouth are the gates of wind and qi.\n**Li [Rong]:** The eyes see external forms, and the heart is moved by what lies before them. The mouth can speak words, and the nose transmits wind and qi—who causes this to be so? All arise without knowing why they are so.\n\nQi flows from the nose and mouth, which are the gates of wind and qi.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** The ears and eyes draw in sounds and sights; the nose and mouth convey wind and qi.\n\nBreath is the dwelling of life; the body’s longevity stands at the tip of breath.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** *Chuanxi* [breath] describes its hurried urgency. A dwelling is where one resides and entrusts oneself. *Li* means to abide; *duan* means the beginning. Human life is fleeting, like a white colt passing through a gap. Breath is hurried and urgent in inhalation and exhalation. When qi gathers, life arises; when qi scatters, death comes—thus qi is the dwelling where life resides. The seven-foot body, the hundred-year lifespan—life and death, departure and abiding—all depend on breath.\n\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Life depends on qi; qi depends on the body. When qi ceases, life perishes; when the body fades, qi disperses.\n\nIt is like the grains, grasses, and trees, which follow the four qi through the seasons.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Grasses and trees rely on the four qi to grow and mature; the bodily form depends on breath as the dwelling of life.\n\nWhen qi parts, the living die; when it waxes or wanes, sickness and toil arise.\n**Wei [Yuan]:** *Bie* means separation. When a person is completely separated from qi, they die. If qi increases or decreases, there is the suffering of sickness and emaciation.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** The four qi have their flourishing and decline; the four seasons have their succession. Thus the hundred grains, grasses, and trees have their growth, maturity, withering, and decay—following their departure, they die; following their arrival, they live. It is like a person, who arises from the four great elements: when the four conditions separate, they die; when the four conditions harmonize, they live. When yang converges, it increases and flourishes; when yin converges, it declines and weakens—thus arise emaciation, illness, toil, suffering, aging, sickness, and death.\n\nSince life and death exist through this, it is better to be at peace in non-action.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Action and desire lead to the flux of life and death; non-action and desirelessness remain constantly at peace, unmoving.\n\nIn non-action, nothing is done—how could there be faults or transgressions?\n**Wei [Yuan]:** The non-active has no doing, no stopping, no going, no coming, no life, no death. Transformations unfold boundlessly—abiding in fate, how could faults or transgressions arise?\n\nDo not covet the body’s form; do not become an enemy to action.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** Indulging in the pleasures of the body, pampering one’s life and nourishment, yielding to the six senses’ desires, following the three karmas’ deeds—action and affairs give rise to the enmity of life and death.\nIf one knows the body is not one’s own, that life is a temporary harmony, and does not overindulge in nurturing or breathing, then what enmity or harm could there be?\n\nWithout constancy, the upright perish as well; the blind and foolish cling to self-blame.\nIt is like fire born from wood, which in turn burns the wood to rot.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Fire arises from wood and then burns the wood itself. Falsehood arises from the self and then destroys the self.",
      "overlap_context": " turn their backs on reality, and embrace falsity—such is the extremity of their shallowness and embellishment, reaching this state.\n\n**Li [Rong]:** *Ji* means to reach. They cannot practice virtue in coming and going, attaining one another through the Dao. Instead, they turn to wealth and goods to mutually benefit one another, their minds set on action.\n\nIt is like a reflection in a mirror—visible but not graspable. It is like an echo in a valley—how can the sound of the wind be woven together?",

      "translated_text": "The Five Phases do not overcome one another, and the myriad things may all be preserved whole.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** The seven-foot body contains all Five Phases. When action exceeds its proper measure, opposition and compliance contend. If one abandons external cleverness and entrusts the form to its own governance, each fulfilling its role, yin and yang proceeding in order without encroaching or overcoming, then the hundred parts of the body remain complete.\n\nThe myriad things have no constancy; what is completed does not long endure.\nThe Three Luminaries are not dim, yet Heaven and Earth remain ever radiant.\n**Wei [Daomiao]:** Where there is completion, there is destruction; without completion, there is no destruction—this is the constant Dao of nature. Thus the sage, though accomplished, does not cling to completion, and so remains ever accomplished. Heaven and Earth are without intent, and thus ever radiant; the Three Luminaries are without intent, and thus never dim; the sage is without intent, and thus ever accomplished.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Observing the Myriad [Things]**\n**Laozi:** Observe the myriad [things] to cultivate the Dao; preserve the spirit in contemplation and thought.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** The Dao of practice has many methods, and the paths of self-cultivation are not singular. Though the transforming Dao has been expounded before, lest the deluded remain unturned, now observe the disciples who study the Dao and the stages of its cultivation. To attain long life and immortality, one must only preserve the spirit and contemplate the Dao. When wisdom unites with the Dao and the spirit is preserved, spirit and form become one. When spirit and form are one, one naturally enters the realm of purity and emptiness. When wisdom unites with the Dao, one silently returns to the source of wisdom. The wondrous fruit is thus achieved—this is the Dao.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Observe the stages of the mind to prevent chaotic thoughts from arising, and contemplate the essential Dao.\n\nThe qi of the Dao and the Three Luminaries—contemplate what governs within the body.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** The *qi* of the Dao refers to guiding and harmonizing; the Three Luminaries are the Three Ones, the spirits within the body. In cultivating the body, one must guide and harmonize the *qi* to attain suppleness, preserve the Three and guard the One, so the One never leaves the body—thus one will naturally attain the Dao. The Three Ones reside within the three palaces of the human body. If one’s contemplation remains unscattered, the spirits will naturally descend. When the spirits descend, the true Dao is accomplished.\n**Liu [Xiao]:** Illumine within and radiate without; the *qi* of Heaven and Earth commune. Calm the spirit and purify the mind, so the guiding principles remain undispersed.\n\nDimly, as in dreams or waking visions, the numinous spirits suddenly come and go.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** If one contemplates the Dao, the Dao will naturally return to them. If one knows how to preserve the spirit, the spirits will naturally descend. Forgetting emotions and thoughts, as in dreams or waking, the spirits descend in indistinct forms, and the true is attained in the formless. The spirits move without obstruction, coming and going without hindrance.\n\nSerene and detached, the will abides in non-action; yet in contemplation and thought, there remains intent.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** *Dàn* should read *chuàng*: tasteless and desolate, empty and still, non-active. The will is set on contemplating the mysterious and preserving the true, wandering freely without affairs. Yet one has not yet reduced the heart to ashes or withered the form; emotions and attachments remain, along with thoughts of pursuit and desires for indulgence.\n\nOne claims to be settled in desirelessness, unaware that holding to contemplation is different.\n**Wei [Daomiao]:** Next, one should relinquish the mind that preserves the spirit. Serene and detached, the will abides in non-action—yet this contemplation of the spirit still involves form and intent. Thus one must further relinquish it to settle in desirelessness, forgetting even the thoughts of contemplation. Hence one does not realize the difference between holding the mind and contemplating the spirit.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** Those who preserve the spirit claim to have calmed the mind and settled the intent, free from the passions of attachment. Yet they do not realize that the spirit harbors thoughts and desires. Though they uphold precepts and close off emptiness, wayward thoughts and imaginings arise unawares.\n\nAt times, the *qi* is still coarse and vigorous; one knows one’s affairs are still many.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** *Yíng* should read *cū*. The learner has not yet weakened the will or refined conduct, nor harmonized and preserved the spirit. At times, the intent and *qi* remain strong and unyielding, favoring coarseness and vigor—coarseness and vigor being the methods of action, which conflict with serenity and detachment. Thus one knows one’s pursuits are excessive and full of strife.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** New thoughts and differing intentions arise subtly at first. Accumulated thoughts grow great; multiplied intentions become many. Entangled in action, confusion deepens—this confusion is still coarse and vigorous. In the world of human affairs, the ten thousand conditions arise; the six senses are bound, and wherever they touch, they become stained. Thus it is called \"many affairs.\" When affairs arise, the form moves; when it moves, it connects outwardly with schemes. When things and affairs flourish, the body is set in motion; when the body is agitated, the mind’s wisdom turns outward, deliberating on gains and losses.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** When external affairs arise, the inner mind is also stirred. Mind and affairs unite, together plotting action—thus it is called \"connecting with schemes.\"\n\nScheming and thinking are the beginning of danger; what is dangerous will not long endure.\nWhat does not endure will soon decline; what declines will not long live.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** Unable to inwardly contemplate the spirit and instead employing wisdom in outward schemes, deliberations multiply, the spirit labors, and the will is lost—this is the cause of harming one’s nature and the beginning of peril. The onset of danger means one will not long endure and will soon suffer decline. When the form is worn externally and the spirit labored within, both inner and outer are harmed. One will soon perish; decline leads to the spirit’s forgetfulness and the *qi*’s dispersal—thus one will not long enjoy life or preserve existence.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** Without thought or deliberation, there is peace; with plotting and scheming, there is danger. Peace brings long endurance; danger does not endure. What does not endure is cut short—thus it is called \"not long-lived.\"\n\nViewing fame and reputation through the body, the affairs of things are difficult to gather.\n**Li [Shaowei]:** The body is internal; fame is external. The inner body is but an empty illusion; external fame is but a fleeting flower. Observing thus, the body cannot long endure, nor can things long be gathered. Why? This single body clings to the ten thousand conditions, all desiring to gather before it—fame, sensual pleasures, profit, and desire, all amassed in one body. Beware of entanglements; do not allow them to stain.\n**Xu [Daomiao]:** The affairs of things refer to wealth and property. The body is the vessel of the Dao; fame is the thief of the body. Thus when fame is established, the body fails; when the body is at peace, the Dao flourishes. Observing thus, fame and wealth are difficult to accumulate.",

      "translated_text": "Greed is the gravest affliction, one that no remedy can remove. If one now wishes to eradicate it, by what Dao should it be done? Simply by being without desire, and the harm will naturally dissolve. If one can forget the self, then the injury will depart.

The True and the vulgar stand in opposition; their choices differ, so the Sage does not esteem what ordinary people hold dear.\n\n**Li [Shaowei]:** The path trodden by petty persons directs their ears and eyes toward sounds and sights, their hearts and minds toward greed and craving. They take this as their affliction, failing to attain the Dao. The Great Sage practices clarity and emptiness, free from desire, the heart not fixed on action—thus free from the burdens of worldly concerns.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** When self and other are both forgotten, how could one seek to be esteemed?\n\nWhat is constant can be made to cease; what is inconstant can be made to endure.\n\n**Wei [Boyang]:** I was originally without form, then suddenly came to be.

      "translated_text": "**Li [Zhen]:** What the common people admire is but the pursuit of fame and profit, the gratification of desires—all rooted in *having*, never willing to embrace *non-being*. The sage, however, inwardly discards the mind’s discriminations and outwardly severs the bonds of reputation. Neither *having* nor *non-having*, yet capable of *non-having* and *having*; not *having* yet able to *have*—this is how *having* may be returned to *non-having*. Not *non-having* yet *non-having*—this is how *non-having* may be returned to *having*. When *non-having* returns to *having*, nothing fails to take form; when *having* returns to *non-having*, nothing is ever destroyed. Now hidden, now manifest, transformation proceeds with effortless mastery.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: The Scripture’s Admonitions**\n**Laozi:** What the scripture admonishes accords with the principles of the Dao.\n\nWhat blazes in glory is not as wondrous as the subtly profound.\n\n**Li [Zhen]:** Examining the scripture’s admonitions and deducing their principles, we see that those of lofty rank and resplendent houses—once favor reaches its peak, disgrace follows; where joy departs, sorrow gathers. They are ever bound to gain and loss, rise and decline. Better to embrace the Dao and dwell in contentment, preserving authenticity and discerning the good. In retreat, one avoids withering; in advancement, one shuns ostentation. Roaming freely among the trees and groves, wandering at ease in the marketplace—this is to preserve the subtly profound and the uncarved simplicity.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** What blazes in glory perishes; what is subtly profound endures. Pursuing this principle to its end, one inevitably arrives here.\n\nReality is not as good as emptiness; multiplicity is not as good as rarity.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** When the mind is truly without delusion, it attains wondrous emptiness. When affairs are tangled and numerous, they breed corruption—thus they are not as good as rarity.\n\nLush abundance meets early death; swiftness is not as good as slowness.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** *Swiftness* means haste. Whether heterodox teachings or orthodox words, all respond to nature. Thus, practicing ritual methods may yield quick results, and supplications to ghosts and spirits often bring swift verification. Cultivating the true Dao, however, yields slow and difficult progress—but once achieved, it is free from failure, leading to the state beyond death and life. Studying heterodox texts brings quick success but also quick ruin, leaving one trapped in the cycle of birth and death. Thus, the heterodox is not as good as the orthodox, and swiftness is not as good as slowness.\n\nWhat rises must fall; what flourishes must decline.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** This is true of all things, not only human affairs.\n\nThe sage severs cunning and acts through *non-action*.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** Severing perverse cunning, abandoning *having*, illuminating true wisdom, and acting through *non-action*.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Severing cunning eliminates rise and flourishing; *non-action* eliminates decline and decay.\n\nSpeaking without speaking, acting without acting.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** Speaking of the principle of *non-speaking*—what is there to say? Acting in the realm of *non-action*—what is there to do?\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Abiding in darkness and following things, wandering with the Dao, one loses all companionship and forgets all cares—where then can action be lodged?\n\nWho can comprehend this? The even is not as good as the odd.\n\n**Wei [Boyang]:** The Dao is originally wordless, yet responds to things with words—thus it speaks without speaking. The Dao is originally actionless, yet responds to things with action—thus it acts without acting. *Even* means two; *odd* means one. Those who understand *non-speaking* and *non-action* must reduce two to one to approach the Dao.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** The body pairs with the spirit; desires pair with the body. Those who labor their forms do so to nourish their bodies; those who lose themselves do so through excessive desires. Thus, those who forget the body attain spiritual stillness; those who abandon desires attain bodily peace. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Those who nurture the will forget the form; those who nurture the form forget profit; those who attain the Dao forget the mind.\"\n\nAbundance is not as good as scarcity—who is wise enough to follow?\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** *Scarcity* means few; *follow* means to comply. Broad learning and wide observation of many schools are not as good as focusing on the essence of the Dao, embracing the One and guarding the mysterious. Thus it is said: \"Abundance brings confusion; scarcity brings attainment.\" Who claims that benevolence, righteousness, integrity, and health make one worthy and good? Yet pursuing fame erodes virtue, giving rise to hypocrisy and shallowness, making it difficult to return to virtue and the Dao. Thus, benevolence can be practiced, righteousness can be compromised, and ritual is but pretense. Who is truly benevolent is hard to find; few rely on righteousness.\n\n**Li [Zhen]:** The practice of *non-action* is difficult to perform; the mind of *non-duality* is rarely awakened. Which worthy or benevolent person can follow their heart’s truth in action? Even benevolence and worthiness are hard to attain—how much more so for the deluded, who find it no easy task. Thus, few can truly rely on the profound and wondrous principles.\n\nTo know *non-knowing* is the pivot of the Dao.\n\n**Li [Zhen]:** If one can follow the teaching of *non-speaking* and rely on the principle of *non-action*, one naturally awakens to the Dao. Though wisdom knows all, it is as if it knows nothing. By forgetting knowledge, one grasps the pivot of the Dao. Here, \"attainment\" means gaining the Dao’s essential wonder.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** The Dao takes *non-knowing* as its foundation. Those who embody it attain its pivot and essence.\n\nEmptiness extinguished into nothingness—what need is there for immortal flight?\n\n**Xu, Li, and Liu’s versions read: \"Emptiness and extinction into nothingness—what need is there for immortal flight?\"**\n\n**Wei [Boyang]:** Abandoning the seven virtues of the great sage and returning to the true essence of benevolence and righteousness is the gradual path to the Dao. The *pivot* is the essential; the *mechanism* is the subtle movement that foreshadows fortune. Having drawn near to the Dao, one understands that the Dao is *non-knowing*—this is the mechanism and essence of the Dao. Yet the Dao’s essence cannot be sought with intention, so one must further reduce the mechanism to emptiness, and emptiness to nothingness—only then can one attain immortal flight. *Immortality* is the name for that which is beyond life and death. The true person comprehends past and present, equals transformation, shares the same body with the myriad things, and is born together with creation. Thus, there is no time when they do not live, no place where they cannot be. Riding emptiness and treading the void, piercing metal and stone—what difficulty is there in this?\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** The spiritual person guards essence and returns to the true, achieving emptiness and extinction into nothingness. The immortal nurtures spirit and attains long life, ascending to heaven with form. Having form is not as good as being formless—thus, what need is there for immortal flight?\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Departing or remaining, leaving the form, following change and submitting to transformation—vast and timeless, what need is there for immortal flight?\n\nThe great Dao is vast and boundless, yet nothing is beyond its control.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** The great Dao is lofty and distant, vast and boundless. It nurtures the myriad things, governs with spirit, and encompasses heaven and earth. Through *non-action*, it achieves all things.",

      "translated_text": "**Li [Daochun]:** Profound and distant—thus it is called \"vast.\" Level and even—thus it is called \"boundless.\" Governing and guiding all things—thus it is called \"control.\" Encompassing the ten thousand existences—thus it is called \"enclosure.\" Should you come to understand this, what you return to is not [what you once knew].\n\n**Li [Daochun]:** Should you come to understand the great Dao, the supreme principle will be thoroughly penetrated, and the dusty burdens of the vast and boundless will all grow cold. Then you will know that the narrow views of the past, the common affections of former days—what was deemed good was not truly good, what was deemed right was not truly right.\n\nThe scripture says: \"Examine carefully—who can follow?\" **Li [Daochun]:** \"Examine carefully\" means \"truly real.\" With an even mind, one illuminates the path of stillness; with an empty self, one reaches the source of the Dao. Extinguish hearing and seeing at their pivot, sever right and wrong in the boundless—this is the teaching of the mysterious and wondrous, the words of truth. Yet those lost in the world, chasing desires, are many; those who forget the passions are few. Who can follow?\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** The Dao severs thoughts and cares, its principle transcends words and images. Its hidden and manifest workings differ greatly—how could this be known by those of shallow understanding?\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Profound and Wondrous**\n\n**Laozi:** The words of the Dao are profound and wondrous; the scriptures and precepts are subtle and hidden. Heaven and earth, the myriad things—all life arises from the One.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; the ten thousand things attain the One and come to life. Thus it is said: all life arises from the One.\n\n**Li [Daochun]:** To cut off thoughts is \"profound\"; to be unfathomable is \"wondrous.\" The One is the mysterious; \"hidden\" is the subtle. The scriptural teachings are deep and distant; the precepts and disciplines are dark and minute. The words spoken are utterly secluded and obscure—yet all declare that heaven, earth, and the myriad things arise from the Dao. This is trustworthy and verifiable.\n\nShould you come to understand this, you will know the real and the illusory. **Li [Daochun]:** To understand is to grasp that the One is the root of things. To know that things arise from the One is real; to speak of what does not arise from the One is illusory.\n\nShould you fail to perceive it, even when shown, you will not distinguish it. **Li [Daochun]:** Were I not to explain it to you, even if you could not perceive it clearly, though I made it manifest, you would still be unable to discern it.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** If the mind is dim and dull, even when things are made manifest, they will not be distinguished.\n\nShould your will cling to being, non-action will be afflicted. **Xu [Gongzu]:** \"Afflicted\" means diseased. Being is the disease of non-action—this urges one to abandon being and return to non-being.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Stillness detests disorder; simplicity abhors complication. Having being is what non-action finds afflicting.\n\nTo be entangled in being is to remain bound for countless eons without end. **Li [Daochun]:** If your will rests in non-action, you will suddenly realize the Dao. If you harbor desires, you will be entangled for a thousand myriad eons, bound by having being, with no way to bring it to completion.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Grasping at this and chasing after that, fettered in chains, the flow of love and attachment—when will it ever end?\n\nThe words of the Dao are subtle and deep; you have yet to distinguish them. Grasp the essentials in brief—truly, be careful not to lose them.\n\n**Wei [Boyang]:** Since you have yet to distinguish the subtle, deep, wondrous, and distant purport of the Dao’s words, you may at least gather the rough and simple truthful words—do not let your mind grow lax.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** The myriad wonders are hard to understand; gather the essential precepts. Preserve virtue and guard the real; follow the precepts and do not lose them.\n\n**Li [Daochun]:** The dark chapters and secret classics cannot be fully expounded. Select and take the essentials; only then should you follow the scriptural precepts. Abandon evil and follow good; exit being and enter non-being. Practice this from beginning to end without fail—this is what it means to comprehend the scriptures.\n\nFirst reduce your desires; do not let the mind wander. **Xu [Gongzu]:** Uphold the precepts and restrain the passions. First reduce desires and block the gates—then the dusty realms will not enter. Close the doors, and the mind and will shall not wander.\n\nDwell in leisure, abide in stillness, refine your thoughts in a purified chamber. **Li [Daochun]:** To be without affairs is to dwell in leisure; to settle the mind is to abide in stillness. To concentrate the emotions is to refine thoughts daily; to cleanse the mind is called a purified chamber.\n\nTen thousand scrolls of alchemical texts are not equal to guarding the One. **Xu [Gongzu]:** Refining the eight stones, revolving the furnace of the nine elixirs, ingesting the knife-point’s measure—one ascends to the pure heavens. Though this is wondrous and divine, it remains but a method and technique. How could it compare to the inner dharma of the original One, the true root of the correct nature? Guard it without losing it, and you will merge with heaven—thus it is said: ten thousand scrolls of alchemical texts are not equal to guarding the One.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** In the Dao, daily reduction is practiced, not relying on elaborate texts. Simply guard the One, and the Dao will naturally be attained.\n\nThe scriptures are not obscure, yet in the end, there is the real and the illusory. Words of being must lead to non-being—you have yet to distinguish this. Words of non-being must lead to being—you have yet to comprehend this.\n\n**Xu [Gongzu]:** Though the scriptures are concise, their principles are not obscure. Worldly teachings are false and illusory; Daoist texts are true and real. Within the real, there is the real—thus being does not definitively remain being but returns to non-being. Non-being does not definitively remain non-being but reverts to generate being. Being and non-being give rise to one another, never having a fixed beginning. You, Master Yin, are still learning and cannot yet distinguish this.\n\n**Li [Daochun]:** The above speaks of the real and the illusory—does this not refer to this? Words of non-being necessarily lead to being—this is the illusory becoming real. Words of being necessarily lead to non-being—this is the real becoming illusory. That the real becomes illusory—you have yet to distinguish this. That the illusory becomes real—you have yet to comprehend this. To comprehend, to distinguish, to know the real and the illusory—once you penetrate the scriptures, you will naturally preserve the Dao.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Principles have their flow and change; words have their restraint and elevation. Those who grasp the text lose its truth; those who cling to the teaching stray from its essence. Subtle words are hidden and obscure—dissecting them is truly difficult. Only when inner understanding is achieved can the mysterious be fully realized.\n\nSimply follow and practice, extinguishing each as it arises. **Li [Daochun]:** Simply rely on and follow the scriptural methods. First abandon evil, then forget good. First break having desires, then extinguish non-action. Forget both having being and non-action; obliterate both good and evil. As thoughts arise, extinguish them one by one.\n\n**Liu [Zijing]:** Since you cannot yet clearly understand the profound purport, simply follow the teachings and practice step by step. Do not pursue thoughts or generate distinctions upon hearing or seeing.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Fifteen: Void and Nothingness**\n\nMaster Laozi said: The Void and Nothingness give birth to spontaneity; spontaneity gives birth to the Dao. The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the myriad things.\n*(Xu, Li, and Liu’s editions all read: \"The Dao gives birth to Heaven; Heaven gives birth to Earth; Earth gives birth to the myriad things.\")*\n\nWei [Chuxuan] said: \"Void and Nothingness\" means there is no thing. \"Spontaneity\" also means there is no thing. It borrows \"Void and Nothingness\" to give birth to spontaneity, and borrows spontaneity to give birth to the Dao—all to clarify its spontaneity. The \"One\" is the function of the Dao. Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things all arise from the Dao; none can depart from it. It is also called the One. The One spreads qi, and the Two Modes (Heaven and Earth) divide from it. Thus it is said, \"The One gives birth to the Two.\" The myriad things are all born from the commingling qi of Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said, \"Heaven and Earth give birth to the myriad things.\"\n\nLi [Rong] said: This refers to things with form, which arise in succession from above to below.\n\nLiu [Renhui] said: Tracing the origin of birth leads to Void and Nothingness. This is a progression of names and principles, yet in truth, one does not know *how* it is so.\n\nThe myriad things embrace the One and attain completion, receiving the subtle and wondrous transformations of qi.\n*(Li’s edition reads: \"transformations of birth.\")*\n\nWei said: Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are all transformed and born from the subtle and wondrous qi of the One.\n\nXu [Daomiao] said: The Two Modes and the myriad things are all completed by the One. Only humans receive the subtle and wondrous qi, and thus possess the ability for numinous transformation.\n\nLi said: Heaven, Earth, and all beings embrace the true Dao of the One. Receiving the subtle and wondrous qi, they are thus able to transform and be born. From this, we know that the qi of the One is the root of the myriad things.\n\nHumans possess the treasure of longevity, yet cannot preserve it. Instead, they seek to augment honor and glory—this is called abandoning the root. It is the Way of generating Heaven and Earth.\n\nXu said: The treasure of longevity is the One. Humans cannot embrace the subtle and wondrous qi, nor preserve the One to attain long life. They fail to safeguard what is truly precious, instead cherishing what others value, increasing their desires, and coveting honor and glory. This is called abandoning the root. The true treasure is the correct Way of the Two Modes.\n\nLiu said: The treasure of longevity refers to the true nature. Those who seek to augment honor and glory lose their original, life-giving nature.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Vast and Indistinct**\n\nMaster Laozi said: The vast and indistinct are the root of the Dao. The myriad things share a common origin; the Dao is their source.\n\nLi said: The ultimate root is empty and still, called Void and Nothingness. Yet Void and Nothingness are not mere emptiness and stillness—their being and non-being are indeterminate, thus they are called \"vast and indistinct.\" Since Void and Nothingness give birth to spontaneity, and spontaneity gives birth to the Dao, we know that Void and Nothingness are the root of the Dao. The myriad things all attain life through the Dao, and thus we know the Dao is the original source of things.\n\nIf one does not forget it within oneself, I alone remain silent.\n*(Wei’s edition reads: \"different.\")*\n\nWei said: All the myriad things share the same origin with the Dao, yet they constantly drift and flow, unable to align with the Dao. Thus they are caught in the waves of life and death. If one can preserve the Dao within oneself, one’s life will never perish. The multitude cannot preserve the Dao; only I alone can do so. Thus I am different from the multitude.\n\nLi said: The Dao is the source of things; qi is the root of life. To lose the Dao is to die; to forfeit qi is to perish. If one does not perish, the sage remains silent and does not speak. Now, expounding the profound words and broadly disseminating the wondrous teachings is to instruct others in nurturing qi and embracing the Dao, returning to the root. If one can draw qi inward and hold the Dao in the heart, neither water nor fire can bring disaster, nor can life and death cause harm. Abiding long in the Dao, one sits upright and attains perfection. Grasping the meaning, one forgets words—thus it is called \"silence.\" To know yet not remain silent is to lose it.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Generation and Placement**\n\nMaster Laozi said: It generated me in the Void; it placed me in Nothingness.\n\nXu said: \"Placed\" means established. The harmonious qi of the Void transformed and gave birth to my form. The numinous and formless established my spirit.\n\nLiu said: The real does not give birth to the real; what gives birth to the real is the Void. The existent does not contain the existent; what contains the existent is Nothingness.\n\nWhat gives me life is spirit; what destroys me is the heart.\n\nWei said: \"Gives life\" means preserves. What allows me to live long is that my heart is one with the Void. What allows me to endure is that my form is one with Nothingness. Spirit has no form or sign, thus it gives me life. The heart has attachments, thus it destroys me.\n\nLi said: The form does not generate itself; it is born only when it attains spirit. The body does not destroy itself; it is killed by the heart. If the heart does not commit evil, one can long endure.\n\nThe heart and its intentions are my affliction. If I have no heart, what can I know?\n\nWei said: To have a heart and intentions is to have attachments, which obstruct life. If I have no heart, then I have no knowledge—what obstruction could there be?\n\nLi said: The heart possesses discriminating knowledge, capable of creating the transgressions of deliberate action. Transgressions become obstructions to me—this truly arises from the heart. If one forgets the heart and has no knowledge, one will naturally be without affliction.\n\nI reflect on the time before I was born: I had no body. It was merely the accumulation of qi and the gathering of blood that formed my body.\n\nWei said: This is the method of relinquishing form and preserving spirit.\n\nXu said: I lament having a body and sigh deeply, longing for the time before I was born, when I had no body and no burdens. Yet qi and blood accumulated to form this fleshly body, a borrowed and insufficient existence. Humans value and cherish it, only increasing their burdens and obstructions.\n\nMy body is the chariot of spirit, the dwelling of spirit, the master of spirit.\n\nXu said: As a horse drives a chariot, so spirit carries the form. Spirit resides in the human body as a person dwells in a house. When the house is whole, the person is at peace; when the body is healthy, spirit is joyful. Thus the wise preserve the body to nurture spirit, moving the form to ascend as an immortal.",

      "translated_text": "Li said: The body can carry spirit, and spirit can ride upon a person—hence it is called a chariot. The body can contain spirit, and spirit regards the body as its dwelling—hence it is called a house. Coming from without to lodge within the body, it is thus called the master. When the master is tranquil, spirit abides within; when restless and agitated, spirit departs.\n\nXu said: When the bodily form is still, spirit rests in its palaces. When restless and active, spirit leaves its dwelling. The word \"immediately\" signifies swift response.\n\nLi said: Only when the chariot is sturdy can it carry things; only when the house is tranquil can it shelter people. If the master is noisy and disorderly, how can the guest remain long? One must firmly guard the body so that spirit may ride upon it, purify the heart so that spirit may rectify it, and maintain inner and outer stillness so that spirit may dwell within. If the body is defiled and the heart and belly are restless, spirit will depart—hence it is said to leave.\n\nLiu said: When spirit resides, there is life; when spirit departs, there is death. Life arises from stillness; death comes from restlessness and peril. Therefore, the sage has no constant heart, desiring to return to the original beginning, to revert to the state before birth.\n\nLi said: Attachment, defilement, and the agitation of worldly striving—these are the hearts of ordinary people. The sage, pure and desireless, has no such constant worldly heart. Those with a heart chase after the superficial and enter the cycle of life and death; those without a heart return to the root and merge with the true Dao, no longer subject to life and death.\n\nLiu said: Utterly still, without anything. Before a person is born, how can there be a body? Without a body, what is there to worry about? What is there to desire?\n\nWei said: Desire and worry both arise from cherishing the body and overvaluing life. If one returns to the state before birth, how can there be a body? What worry or burden can there be?\n\nLi said: Only after birth does one have form; before birth, there is no body in principle. With a body, a hundred worries arise and the five desires contend; without a body, all burdens are cast off and a thousand sorrows vanish. Even the burdens of having a body are gone—how can there be disasters beyond the body? Thus, to set the body aside and preserve spirit is to retain luminous essence. When virtue and the Dao unite, one communicates with the Dao.\n\nWei said: Luminous essence is spirit and clarity. To set the body aside means that luminous essence does not leave the form. When essence constantly remains, virtue and the Dao naturally unite as one, and when they unite as one, the Dao becomes fully realized.\n\nXu said: To distance oneself from the transient form and cherish the spirit that gives life, one must empty the heart and still the body, preserve spirit and maintain simplicity. Then the mysterious essence shines brightly, abiding in its chambers, uniting with the Dao as one—this is called the body without a body.\n\nLi said: Those who strive for worldly life and those who study the Dao must forget the body externally, not indulge in rich flavors, and first inwardly preserve spirit, directing their will toward the Dao. In the realm of the indistinct and subtle, wisdom naturally returns; radiant essence shines brightly, illuminating all without exception—hence it is called \"luminous essence remains.\" When wisdom comes to rest, virtue and the Dao unite as one, equalizing without partiality, harmonizing with emptiness and communication—hence it is said to \"communicate with the Dao.\"\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: On Practicing the Dao**\n\nLaozi said: Those who practiced the Dao in ancient times all followed nature.\n\nLi said: The practitioners of the Dao in ancient times all acted naturally. With virtue pure and desireless, they needed no teacher’s instruction to cultivate the Dao naturally—there were none who did not follow nature. If one forces it, it will not be so. Thus, the Dao is naturally so; to force it is not so.\n\nLiu said: It is not done with intention; to force it is to act with intention—hence it is not so.\n\nLi said: To concentrate the mind and unite with the Dao, to be desireless and preserve the true, to practice with constancy—this is to attain the Dao of nature. If one does not establish conduct externally or cultivate the heart internally but forces oneself to act, the Dao will never be attained. Why is this? Because thoughts and intentions oppose the Dao.\n\nLiu said: Why is it not so? The Dao has no thoughts or intentions; those with a heart contradict it. Thus, the instrument of *chong* and *yue* depends on its user.\n\nXu said: The *yue* has six holes like a flute and is a musical instrument. The instrument is empty and hollow, depending on the user—just as the sage is empty and without intention, responding to all stimuli, depending on circumstances to act and adapt. Emptiness and fullness, being and non-being, square and round, large and small, long and short, wide and narrow—all depend on the user and do not contend with others.\n\nLi said: *Chong* means to expel, and *yue* is a flute. The *chong* emits qi, and the *yue* produces sound—both are without intention, subject to human manipulation. The size of the qi, the length of the sound, whether square or round, broad or narrow—all follow human creation and do not contend with others. This is an analogy.\n\nLiu said: Without intention to seek use, there is no contention.\n\nWhen a good person is in the world, it is like the *chong* and *yue*—not contending with the myriad things, their virtue always returns to them.\n\nLiu said: Responding to things is all; the beauty of sound and qi always returns to the *chong* and *yue*. The virtue of non-action always returns to the sage. This is because they are empty, hollow, and desireless.\n\nWei said: Heaven, without intention, follows things, allowing all things to fulfill their natures. The world returns to it as its lord.\n\nLi said: This completes the analogy. The virtuous noble, establishing virtue and refining others, externally does not contend with things, and internally is desireless and humble. Virtue naturally returns to them, and the Dao resides within.\n\nDesire is the root of misfortune and harm; non-desire is the origin of heaven and earth. None know its root; none know its origin.\n\nLi said: Desire harms the body—hence it is the root of misfortune and harm. Non-desire unites with the Dao—hence it is the origin of heaven and earth. Yet deluded emotions confuse and obscure understanding, leaving people ignorant of desire as the root of misfortune and non-desire as the source of blessing. Thus, they are enlightened.",

      "translated_text": "The sage eliminates desire to enter non-desire, thereby aiding their person.\n\nLi said: Externally relinquishing covetous desires, guarding the self through non-action—only the sage can achieve this. With the Dao as their support and wings, they may endure long. If one follows the common flow, they cannot avoid misfortune and harm. Yet the great sage knows neither peril nor safety, neither defilement nor purity. Now, speaking of eliminating desire to enter non-desire is to instruct the deluded masses in proper conduct. Those who follow the sagely way may attain the Dao.\n\nLiu said: Not eliminating desire is not the way to aid the self.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Sounds and Colors**\nLaozi said: All people take sounds, colors, and rich flavors as joy, yet they do not know that sounds, colors, and rich flavors are the great unhewn of misfortune.\n\nLi said: Ordinary people love sounds and colors, delight in rich flavors, and indulge their emotions to satisfy their desires—thus they deem it the highest joy. Yet desire is the root of harm, sound the origin of deafness, the mouth is dulled by flavors, and the eyes are dimmed by colors. These do not come from without but arise from within.\n\nLiu said: Jie and Zhou lost their states because of them—how could this not be the great unhewn of misfortune? Thus, the sage eliminates desire to return to non-desire.\n\nLi said: Only the sage can empty the heart of desire, remain pure and still, and practice non-action. Disasters do not arise, and calamities do not occur. Transformations bring great peace, and one rightly returns to the Dao.\n\nLiu said: Abandoning the root of misfortune, returning to the source of blessing.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: The Dao’s Emptiness**\nLaozi said: The Dao is a thing of emptiness and nothingness—it is empty yet acts as fullness, nothing yet acts as being.\n\nXu said: Both are alike.\n\nWithout form, it is like emptiness; acting as being, it is like fullness. Subtle and wondrous, without substance, yet acting as if it has form—thus it has the formless form, the shapeless shape. Heaven receives the singular qi, vast and clear, and thereby achieves purity. The qi descends to transform and give birth to the myriad things, each with its distinct form.\n\nXu said: Heaven’s qi descends, earth’s qi ascends; the two qi intermingle and harmonize, giving birth to the myriad things. The myriad things have myriad forms, each distinct—none are alike.\n\nLi said: Empty yet acting as full, nothing yet acting as being—this means that within emptiness and nothingness, it divides the Three Powers and generates the myriad things. The Three Powers have images, hence it is called full; the myriad things have forms, hence it is called being. Taking the great to illustrate the small, it speaks of heaven receiving the singular qi. Thus, we know that things are endowed with the primordial harmony. Heaven, vast and clear, is without partiality, never deviating from the One. People, too, must diligently strengthen their resolve, remain pure and still, practice non-action, and never deviate from the Dao. Though the qi is singular, the forms differ—hence it is said each is distinct.\n\nTherefore, the sage knows that virtue and the Dao are undifferentiated, mysterious, and wondrously the same.\n\nXu said: *Hundun* (chaos) is the appearance of no distinction. The sage embodies the undivided primordial unity; virtue and the Dao are chaotically one, profoundly wondrous, originally the same.\n\nThey also know that heaven and earth’s purity and stillness both abide in the One.\n\nXu said: Heaven receives the profound and subtle qi, thus it is pure and high above. Earth receives the turbid and yellow qi, thus it is heavy and still below. Though the two poles differ, their abiding in the One is the same.\n\nThus, they align their hearts with heaven and are without knowledge.\n\nXu said: Their hearts align with the profound and empty, without knowledge or desire.\n\nLiu said: The four seasons operate without knowledge.\n\nThey align their bodies with the Dao and are without form.\n\nXu said: Their bodies align with emptiness, without form as their body.\n\nLiu said: They merge indistinguishably with the supremely wondrous, hence they are without form.\n\nOnly then does the heavenly Dao flourish.\n\nLiu said: The great Dao resides in humanity.\n\nTo restrain the will and return the thoughts.\n\nLi said: Aligning the heart with humanity, the heart is without distinction. Aligning the body with the Dao, the body is without false form. Uniting with heaven in virtue, joining the Dao in truth—this is called the flourishing of the heavenly Dao. How can one attain the flourishing of the heavenly Dao? By restraining the will, eliminating deep intentions, returning the thoughts, and abandoning excessive contemplation—only then can it be achieved.\n\nLiu said: The multitude speaks of restraining the heart without intent.\n\nIt departs yet cannot be pursued; it remains yet cannot be sent away.\n\nLiu said: Responding to things, it is distant yet abiding—its essence endures long.\n\nXu said: Following it, it is gone and cannot be pursued; its formless form remains and cannot be sent away.\n\nThe distant extends beyond the infinite and cannot be exhausted.\n\nLiu said: Vast and boundless.\n\nThe near is within oneself, yet people do not see it.\n\nLiu said: Faint and without image.\n\nThus, the noble person does not see, does not listen, does not speak, and does not eat all day. They inwardly know and embrace the mysterious.\n\nLi said: The noble person who cherishes the Dao restrains their brilliance, severs seeing and hearing, is cautious in speech, avoids extravagance, moderates their diet, cuts off rich flavors, empties the heart to contemplate the mysterious—hence it is called inward knowing. Not losing the subtle and wondrous, this is called embracing the mysterious.\n\nIf one wishes to see, there is nothing to be seen; if one wishes to listen, there is nothing to be heard; if one wishes to speak, there is nothing to be said; if one wishes to eat, there is nothing to be tasted.\n\nXu said: Realizing emptiness and penetrating delusion, even form is non-being. When emotions forget the dusty realm, what is there to speak of or perceive?\n\nLi said: Awakening to the emptiness of all realms, the heart becomes utterly still.\n\nHow serene and still—it cannot be tasted, returning to nothingness.\n\nWei said: Externally forgetting hearing and seeing severs the desires of sight and sound; internally forgetting the heart and mouth extinguishes the desires of speech and food. Only when inner and outer are extinguished can one attain serene stillness and return to nothingness.\n\nLi said: Amidst the bustle of competition and the cycle of action, serene stillness returns to the Dao of nothingness.\n\nIf one can always be pure, still, and practice non-action, there will be no self to return.\n\nLiu said: Those who attain the true are not governed by action.\n\nReturning to the state before birth, one is without body.\n\nLi said: Without inner or outer defilement, this is called purity and stillness. Calming the spirit and ceasing thoughts is called non-action. Merging the qi with the vast, returning to the state before birth, the body aligns with nature and is without self.",

      "translated_text": "To nurture the body through non-action is to preserve the physical form whole.\nXu said: Through purity, stillness, and non-action, embracing virtue to nurture the body, harmonious qi is restored, thus preserving the physical form whole.\n\nWhen heaven and earth are replete, longevity is preserved.\nWei said: When the qi of the Dao returns to the body, one forgets the body; forgetting the body, virtue merges with heaven and earth. Heaven and earth do not seek self-preservation, thus they endure forever. In this way, the body is not preserved yet remains whole, and years are not guarded yet naturally extend.\nXu said: When the essential qi of heaven and earth fills my body, lifespan aligns with the two poles, hence \"longevity is preserved.\"\nLi said: Nurturing the body through non-action, pacifying people without affairs, merit reaches the four directions, and the Dao overflows the six voids—this is called repletion. Those who cultivate the body enjoy long life; those who govern the state ensure enduring prosperity—this is \"longevity preserved.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Lamenting Others**\nLaozi said: Lamenting others is not as good as lamenting oneself.\nXu said: *Lament* means to pity. Those who study pity others for sinking into worldliness and forgetting to return, yet this is not as good as lamenting one’s own inability to nurture the spirit and guard the body.\nLamenting oneself is not as good as cherishing the spirit.\nXu said: *Cherish* means to treasure. When the spirit labors, it departs the body; when it departs, life perishes. Indulging in the six desires injures the spirit and harms one’s nature.\nCherishing the spirit is not as good as containing the spirit.\nLi said: Though one cherishes the spirit, if it remains labored, it is like an infant still harmed by breathing—it does not compare to containing the spirit. To contain the spirit is to be outwardly unattached and undefiled, inwardly free from thought and worry. With inner and outer purity, the spirit naturally returns and does not leave the body—this is called *containing the spirit*.\nContaining the spirit is not as good as guarding the body.\nLi said: Though the spirit is most wondrous, it cannot stand alone; it must rely on the body to function. If one merely contains the spirit without guarding the body, when the body decays and form disperses, the spirit has nowhere to reside. To ensure the spirit’s long abiding, one must first guard the body. Guarding the body requires purity and absolute clarity, aligning with the Dao and virtue, penetrating the profound and subtle, merging with the ultimate void without duality. Preserving the Three and guarding the One, one unites with the true spirit.\nGuarding the body ensures long endurance and eternal abiding.\nLiu said: What is moved by emotions and desires is the human; without emotions and desires, it is merely the body—where then does the human reside? *Lament* means to pity. *Cherishing the spirit* is like valuing the child and honoring the mother. *Containing the spirit* means, having already esteemed it, to deepen this esteem, nurturing its radiance and preventing its dissipation. *Guarding the body* means the house is tranquil and the master at peace, the guest dispersed and the host settled. The body is the spirit’s dwelling, so one guards the body to pacify the spirit. When the body is not restless, the spirit is serene and at peace; form and spirit both preserved, one attains enduring abiding. The guest cannot be solitary; the traveler does not rely on the host. The spirit does not transform alone; it must depend on the body. Thus, the guest does not rely on the host, nor does the spirit stand without the body. Therefore, the body is the root of the spirit, and the host is the foundation of the guest. Those who cherish the spirit must first guard the body; those who preserve the guest must cherish the host. Hence, *containing the spirit is not as good as guarding the body.*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Spirit Gives Birth**\nLaozi said: The spirit gives birth to form, and form completes the spirit.\nChong said: The spirit serves as the function of generating form; without this function, form does not arise. Form serves as the benefit of nurturing the spirit; without this benefit, the spirit is not completed.\nLiu said: Form does not arise without the spirit; the spirit is not completed without form. Form cannot generate itself without the spirit; the spirit cannot complete itself without form.\nChong said: Form borrows the spirit to arise; the spirit embraces form to be completed. Without the union of form and spirit, there is no way for generation or completion.\nLiu said: Following the spirit’s transformation to generate forms, hence form cannot generate itself. Following the forms to complete the spirit’s work, hence the spirit cannot complete itself. When form and spirit unite, they alternately generate and complete one another.\nChong said: Benefit and function depend on each other, alternately generating and completing.\nLiu said: Though form and spirit differ, they rely on each other for generation and completion. The way of generation and completion cannot be achieved without union—hence *form and spirit unite*.\nThe spirit employs form, and form gives birth to the spirit. When the form’s function is manifest, the spirit’s work is achieved—this is the spirit giving birth to form. Form arises from the spirit, and the spirit employs form. When the spirit’s work is manifest, its manifestation arises from form—this is form completing the spirit. Hence, *they alternately generate and complete one another*. Form does not arise on its own; it must rely on the spirit’s transformation. When the spirit moves, form acts, and function is achieved. Completion arises from the spirit’s generation—this is the spirit completing form. The spirit does not transform alone; its movement must rely on form. When form acts, the spirit follows, and the spirit’s work is revealed. Revelation arises from the spirit’s employment—this is form completing the spirit. Hence, *they alternately complete one another*.\nThe spirit constantly cherishes humans, yet humans do not cherish the spirit.\nLi said: The spirit, having entrusted itself to humans, also desires that humans not die. Humans, relying on the spirit, must also ensure the spirit does not depart. To prevent its departure, one must cultivate the body and purify the heart. Only those who cultivate thus truly cherish the spirit. Yet most people are defiled and impure, unwilling to cultivate the body. Since the body is not cultivated, this is not cherishing the spirit.\nLiu said: The spirit constantly cherishes humans, desiring their tranquility, yet humans do not cherish the spirit, exhausting it without limit. Thus, one must *abandon sagacity and discard wisdom*, returning to non-knowing.\nLi said: The sage has no name; if there is no name, what is there to abandon? Great wisdom appears foolish; if wisdom is like foolishness, it is already non-knowing—what is there to discard? The present text speaks of *abandoning* and *discarding* because sagacity entails the burden of merit and fame, and wisdom entails the mechanism of discrimination. Discrimination wearies the heart; pursuing fame harms the body. When body and heart are harmed, form departs and spirit scatters—this is not cherishing the spirit or guarding the body, acting with loss of the Dao. It urges abandoning fame and ceasing thoughts to return to non-knowing—this is cherishing the spirit.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Constant Peace**",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: The sage abides in constant peace. In harmony with Heaven and Earth, they commune with ghosts and spirits.\n\nLi said: The sage inwardly dispatches the heart’s perceptions and outwardly relinquishes the bodily form, merging with the profound stillness to unite with the true, aligning with emptiness and mystery in essence. Unaltered by yin and yang, unmoved by flourishing or decline, their mysterious virtue remains ever tranquil—thus they abide in constant peace. They share with Heaven and Earth the same capacity for shelter and support, and with ghosts and spirits the same rectitude and truth. Embracing the vast and enfolding the minute, they penetrate the hidden and fathom the subtle, free from times of obstruction or adversity, beyond days of hardship or destitution. Thus it is said: they unite their virtue with Heaven and Earth, and ghosts and spirits come to dwell with them.\n\nLiu said: Without affairs, without action, the obscure and the luminous flow unimpeded.\n\nThe multitude find peace in what is not truly peaceful—thus they are not at peace.\n\nWei said: Those who find peace in life are unsettled by death. Those who find peace in wealth and honor are unsettled by poverty and lowliness.\n\nLiu said: To find peace in action is to rely on what is not constant—losing one’s support leads to distress. For the Way of Heaven conceals what is full and replenishes what is empty, dismantles the strong and flourishing, and augments the weak and declining.\n\nLiu said: Diminishing the full and enriching the humble is like drawing a bow.\n\nChong said: The sun turns back at its zenith, the moon wanes after it is full, yang declines when it is at its peak, and yin weakens when it is strong—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nThe sage models themselves on Heaven in ordering things, practicing the law of impartiality: reducing excess, supplementing deficiency, restraining the high and powerful, and elevating the low and weak. They diminish thoughts and concerns, returning to childlike simplicity; they block perverse wisdom, embodying the sage’s uncarved simplicity.\n\nChong said: *Meng* (蒙) originally meant *meng* (朦), \"unclear.\" Excessive thinking breeds cunning contrivances, and too much deliberation gives rise to scheming treachery. Strange objects attract bandits and thieves, and deceitful distortions thrive in fraudulent streets—thus they urge reducing them to return to childlike simplicity. Childlike simplicity is unenlightened, free from the self-consuming fire of action; it does not adorn itself with cleverness to startle others. Closing off crooked wisdom and opening the luminous true wisdom, false methods do not spread, and the true Dao flows widely. Eliminating the perverse and embracing the upright is the foundation of sagely transformation.\n\nLiu said: Curbing anger and restraining desires, nurturing simplicity with rightful measure—when external wisdom is entirely discarded, this is the sage’s unadorned substance.\n\nThus, when the world esteems what endures, it may be called nurturing the mother.

      "translated_text": "Master Ren Zhen, with annotations by Liu Renhui and compiled by Bi Xuzi\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Body and Mind**\n\nLaozi said: When the body is empty, the myriad things arrive; when the mind is without, harmonious qi returns.\n\nChong said: When the body unites with the Dao, this is the body’s emptiness; when the mind aligns with Heaven, this is the mind’s absence. With the body empty, the myriad things come of themselves; with the mind absent, harmonious qi returns of itself. Thus, emptiness and nothingness are the supreme subtlety of non-action.\n\nTherefore, those who excel in nurturing the body conceal their person within the body without revealing it, and conceal others within humanity without displaying their abilities.\n\nChong said: To conceal the body is to remain hidden and unassuming, never displaying one’s talents. To conceal others is to blend with the common world, never revealing one’s wisdom or virtue.\n\nThus, the noble person’s governance must first die to the state.\n\nLiu said: *Die* means to forget. One who forgets the state, though occupying the highest position, is not esteemed; though possessing the four seas, is not enriched. Not being enriched, extravagance is discarded; not being esteemed, ostentation is abandoned. Abandoning ostentation, labor is not exhausted; discarding extravagance, resources are not depleted. When resources are not depleted, stores are full; when labor is not exhausted, the people are at peace. When the people are at peace, the state is secure; when stores are full, the state is substantial. A substantial state is the foundation of governance; a secure state is its root. To preserve the root and foundation of perfect governance—does this not arise from forgetting the state? If one violates this Dao, ruin and oblivion swiftly follow. Examine the records of the past, and the verdict is certain.\n\nWhen one has died yet not perished, the state flourishes. The people do not dare to scatter, and abundance is restored.\n\nLiu said: To forget yet retain it is why it does not perish; to govern through non-action is why the state flourishes. When all beings follow their nature, customs are joyful and dwellings peaceful, with sweet food and fine clothing, yet none visit one another.\n\nLi said: *Die* means to forget. Those who cultivate the body realize that when the body is absent, the person is absent; when the person is absent, the self is absent. Forgetting the body, the body endures. Those who govern the state embody emptiness and stillness, their virtue merging with the vastness of space. They forget the world entirely—thus it is said they must first die to the state. Having forgotten the state, they leave the world at ease, lighten taxes and corvée, and the people live in peace—thus it is said, \"having died yet not perished, the state flourishes.\" With governance in great harmony, none flee; thus it is said, \"the people do not scatter, the state is substantial.\" With the people prosperous, grain stores full, and defenses secure, it is said, \"abundance is restored.\"\n\nIf one can know the constant, actions will reverse course.\n\nChong said: When one knows the plain and true constant, preserving the profound virtue of the great Dao, all actions and conduct will reverse the common ways.\n\nLiu said: Those who know the constant Dao ensure that all undertakings return to restore true nature.\n\nThe multitude rejoices, using life to sustain life. Acting and losing it, their lifespan is exhausted.\n\nWei said: To die yet not perish is the constancy of longevity. But one’s conduct differs from the common, hence it is called *reversal*. The multitude, valuing the richness of life, act and lose life, thus their lifespan ends.\n\nChong said: The multitude take a hundred years as the norm, finding joy in comfort and rich flavors, using the six desires to sustain life. In acting, they harm life and lose their nature, leading to the exhaustion of their lifespan.\n\nLi said: The multitude use the life they possess to sustain the body, indulging their passions and desires to the utmost, believing this to be joy. Yet this harms life and injures the body. Above, they lose the Dao; below, they lose themselves—thus it is said, \"acting and losing it, their lifespan is exhausted.\"\n\nHow vast is the great thing of the world! So ceaselessly continuous, so darkly undifferentiated—unknowable.\n\nXu said: The *great thing* is the Great Ultimate and the great Dao. The Great Ultimate is the parent of Heaven and Earth, the mystery of the Dao. Ceaselessly continuous, unbroken and unending, darkly profound, undifferentiated—beyond the grasp of knowledge, difficult to discuss in words.\n\nThose who know it depart from it; those who desire it are separated from it; those who draw near it distance themselves from it.\n\nLi said: Seeking it with knowledge, one cannot attain it—thus it is said to depart. Grasping it with desire, one cannot obtain it—thus it is said to be separated. It cannot be made intimate—thus it is said to be distant.\n\nTherefore, the sage does not rely on the world, nor on ghosts and spirits, nor on the myriad things. He constantly takes emptiness as his body and nothingness as his mind.\n\nLi said: *Rely* means to depend or borrow. The sage attains the Dao without depending on the world in the manifest realm, nor on ghosts and spirits in the hidden, nor on the myriad things externally. He constantly takes emptiness as his body and nothingness as his mind, thus naturally accomplishing the Dao. If one’s mind forgets affairs and the will rests in emptiness and nothingness, though one does not seek to accomplish the Dao, the Dao is accomplished of itself.\n\nThese two—emptiness and nothingness—are called the body without body, the mind without mind. This may be called *guarding the spirit*.\n\nLi said: These two are emptiness and nothingness. Taking emptiness as the body is the body without body; taking nothingness as the mind is the mind without mind. The mind without mind is no-mind; the body without body is no-body. Utterly without body and mind—this is called *guarding the spirit*. Though called guarding the spirit, it is through emptiness and nothingness that the spirit naturally returns—thus it is called *guarding the spirit*.\n\nLiu said: Cutting off external entanglements, the spirit is inwardly at peace—this is the way of guarding the spirit.\n\nGuarding the spirit, penetrating the profound—this is called *uniting with the Dao*.\n\nWei said: The spirit does not leave the form—thus it is called *guarding*. When spirit and form preserve one another, they penetrate the profound and unite with the Dao.\n\nLi said: Able to guard the spirit with emptiness and nothingness, the spirit communicates with the subtlety of emptiness and nothingness, and the body unites with the essence of the great Dao—thus it is called *penetrating the profound*.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Without Thought**\n\nLaozi said: The wise person has no thoughts, no anxieties, no changes...",

      "translated_text": "Li said: To aid the world with the Dao, to soften the distant with culture—thus the hundred clans use it daily yet remain unaware, and the myriad states naturally rejoice in peace. With few private concerns and scant desires, grain is prized and gold devalued; customs delight in familial harmony, music and ritual blend in harmony—this is the transformation of non-action. But if one indulges passions to the utmost, luxuriating in excess and craving victory, then the four outskirts bristle with strife, the five weapons stir in ceaseless motion, and behind the palace gates, calamity arises within. When the ruler is benighted and disordered, ministers grow disloyal and unrighteous, the state falls into turmoil, corvée labor never ceases, and the people are exhausted by transport and supply. The people grow weary and depart—thus the state, standing, is undone.\n\nChong said: The body takes spirit and qi as its root. When spirit guards and qi gathers, there is long life. But if one acts with purpose and busies oneself with affairs, spirit and qi are worn away; when spirit departs and qi scatters, the form is undone.\n\nLi said: The root of governing a state lies in pacifying the people. When the people are at peace, they are at ease; when they are in peril, they are wearied. At ease, the people remain; wearied, they depart. The flourishing of a state is fixed in its people. Once the people depart, the state is undone—this is known. Order and chaos arise from the Dao; flourishing and decay lie with the people. Cherishing the people with the Dao, heaven endures and earth lasts.\n\nLiu said: The people are the state’s root; when the root scatters, the state perishes. This is what is meant by \"bringing forth the treasure of the boundless\" and \"entering the sharp blades of the bandit’s axe and halberd.\"\n\nChong said: Axe and halberd are weapons. Life is more precious than ten thousand pieces of gold. When spirit abides and qi gathers, life is inexhaustible; when spirit perishes and qi scatters, the body is slain and life ends—thus it is said, \"bringing forth the treasure of the boundless.\" The six bandits invade from without, the three poisons arise within, their assault more severe than the six armies, their slaughter more cutting than axe and halberd.\n\nLi said: The treasure is the Dao of non-action; the bandit is the weapon of purposeful action. When I practice non-action, others transform of themselves—this is employing the Dao of non-action. If one does not use the Dao of non-action, it is like bringing forth the treasure of the boundless, as if wielding the weapon of purposeful action. Weapons harm things, consuming a thousand pieces of gold daily, sharper than blades—thus it is said, \"entering the sharp blades of the bandit’s axe and halberd.\" Therefore the sage practices non-action and refrains from busyness, desiring to pacify the state and its people.\n\nLi said: Valuing desires leads to harm for the people; war and conquest weary them. Non-action and refraining from busyness bring no harm, no weariness—thus the people are at peace, and this is the sage’s transformation. Hence it is said: If you can know the One, all affairs are complete.\n\nLi said: Employing the Dao through non-action is knowing the One; when merit is achieved and affairs are accomplished, matters are complete. Inwardly, clarity reaches the ultimate Dao—this is knowing the One. When conduct is perfected and virtue is fulfilled, following causes to realize effects, attaining the true Dao, affairs are complete. With no intent, virtue lingers, and ghosts and spirits submit.\n\nXu said: The One is the true One; virtue is constant virtue. To know the One is to know all without knowing anything—thus all affairs are complete. Empty and without intent, constant virtue lingers and abides. Thus one can govern heaven and earth, store the myriad things, and awe the thousand spirits, so that ghosts and spirits stand in awe and submit. Inwardly, to dissolve the ghost is to refine essence. The true One is the utmost extreme of the One; constant virtue is the utmost nobility of virtue. They are the root of essence and spirit, the origin of the Dao and qi. Thus spirit and essence submit, and the myriad qi return to their source.\n\nLi said: The sage is without intent, does not stir craving or desire, holds the Dao within, and virtue abides in the self—thus it is said to linger. Employing the Dao, the Dao flows near and far; embracing virtue, virtue covers the hidden and the manifest. Being what people turn to for refuge, they are also what ghosts and spirits submit to and follow.\n\nLiu said: To act with intent is to have virtue, and virtue thus departs. Therefore the scripture says: \"The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue.\" Its ghosts are not numinous—thus it is said they submit.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: \"I Command My Fate\"**\nLaozi said: My fate lies with me, not with heaven and earth.\n\nLi said: Heaven and earth are impartial, letting things transform of themselves. How could they determine the length of life? It is only that people’s conduct has good and evil, thus fate has prosperity and adversity. If one can preserve it with the Dao and receive it with qi, when qi continues, fate does not end; when the Dao abides, longevity naturally lengthens—thus it is said, \"not with heaven and earth.\" I do not see, do not hear, do not know; spirit does not leave the body and endures together with the Dao.\n\nLi said: Not seeing, thus not blinded by forms; not hearing, thus not deafened by sounds; not knowing, thus not ensnared by wisdom. Cutting off sounds and forms to attain purity, abandoning discrimination to practice non-action, spirit does not depart from the person—thus it is said, \"does not leave the body.\" When body and spirit unite, fate and the Dao become one—thus it is said, \"endures together.\" What is meant by \"not with heaven and earth\" is that one’s conduct is like this, thus attaining unity with the Dao.\n\nLiu said: Abandoning the use of ears and eyes, discarding the concerns of heart and intellect, forgetting the heart so that spirit does not leave the body—this accords with the constant Dao. I share with heaven and earth the governance of a single qi, guarding my root.\n\nWei said: Heaven, earth, and I are all born of the same natural qi, each a single thing—how could they give me my fate? I only discard heart-knowledge, sever ears and eyes, and each guards the root of that single qi—thus I endure together with the Dao. *Zhuangzi* said: \"Heaven and earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one\"—this is what is meant.\n\nLi said: The myriad things all rely on the great Dao; the three powers share the same qi. Yet people all pursue the branches and thus harm life. The Old Master guarded the root and thus could attain the Dao. If one can model the sage’s conduct, emptiness and naturalness may be achieved—not by imitating the multitude’s practice of goodness, not by practicing benevolence and righteousness, not by practicing loyalty and trust, not by practicing reverence, not by practicing love and desire.

      "translated_text": "Li said: To do good is to draw near to fame; to do evil is to draw near to punishment. The sage distances himself from both punishment and fame, and thus does not learn to practice goodness as the multitude does. The benevolent sacrifice themselves to benefit others; the righteous correct wrongs to rectify themselves. The sage cultivates life and thus does not kill; being free from perversity, he has no need to rectify—this is not the practice of benevolence and righteousness. Loyalty and trust are the blossoms of the Dao; the sage discards the blossoms and takes the fruit, and thus does not practice loyalty and trust. Filial piety is not innate nature; rites differ from utmost sincerity. A heart may be cruel while the countenance is reverent—this is not wondrous conduct, and thus it is not practiced. Desire is the root of misfortune and calamity; love is the source of affliction. When love and desire reside within the self, there is still no peace—how then can one attain the Dao? The sage is pure and tranquil, and thus does not practice love and desire. Harming nothing, benefit comes of itself.\n\nConstantly embracing fearlessness and non-action, the great Dao returns. Li said: The preceding—from practicing goodness to love and desire—all pertains to action. The Old Master embraced the Dao and held fast to virtue, serene and non-active. Constantly practicing this conduct, he thus attained perfection, and so it is said the great Dao returns. Liu said: Where there is benefit, things gather; where there is non-action, the Dao returns.\n\nThus the spirit-person has no radiance; the sage has no fame. Liu said: Inner illumination casts no light; virtue conceals itself amidst the throng. Li said: When the great Dao returns, its use is boundless. Transformation beyond measure is called \"spirit\"; wisdom that penetrates all is called \"sage.\" The person who is without affairs—truly, the spirit is non-active. Wisdom’s illumination is congealed and still, thus there is no radiance; the form is hidden and the function concealed, thus there is no fame.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: On Arms**\n\nThe Old Master said: Arms are the greatest inauspicious affair under heaven, not the treasure of the state. Liu said: When arms are mobilized, they harm beings; they bring ruin to states and destruction to families. No calamity is greater—how can they be called the state’s treasure? To treasure them is to not use them. Wei said: Guarding the Dao and practicing non-action, all under heaven find peace in what is naturally so, and arms are not used—this is called the great treasure. Why employ these inauspicious and baleful instruments? Liu said: The state’s treasure is to not use arms. To use them is to invite the peril of losing the state and its people. Li said: To quell disorder and bring stability, arms are indeed necessary. When employed with compassion, victory in battle comes of itself. Yet arms are fundamentally instruments of killing, and killing is an inauspicious affair—not the state’s treasure. To cherish life and detest killing, to value grain and love the people, to be without arms in war—this is the state’s treasure. Thus it is said: to treasure them is to not use them. To use them is to invite the peril of losing the state and its people—this is the greatest of inauspicious affairs. Liu said: If arms are used, it must come to this.\n\nTo bring peace to all under heaven, one should be without affairs—how much more so with arms? One cannot use them willingly. Thus the sage embraces subtlety and holds fast to simplicity, and does not dare to act or contend with all under heaven. Chong said: The sage is empty and non-active, embraces the Dao and guards virtue, and does not dare to pursue contention and action, vying with the people of the world for fame and profit. Li said: Preserving the essential Dao is to \"embrace subtlety\"; not losing the pure wind is to \"hold fast to simplicity.\" Being non-active and abandoning arms, ceasing from schemes and warfare, one does not contend with all under heaven. Liu said: Where there is action and desire, contention and seizure arise; where there is no affair and no action, joyful yielding persists without departure.\n\nThough there be fierce beasts, they cannot burn; though there be wasps, scorpions, insects, and snakes, they cannot sting; though there be blades and weapons, they cannot harm. Li said: With the mind dwelling in the correct Dao and conduct embodying simplicity, extending forbearance to others and harboring no harmful intent within, though external poisons exist, they cannot be inflicted. Liu said: Though a child be fierce and stubborn, he cannot harm a compassionate father; though beasts be ferocious and violent, they cannot harm a sage. For the sage has accumulated virtue and attained mysterious penetration—thus none under heaven can harm him. Wei said: Virtue pervades the six directions; mysterious penetration extends throughout the cosmos. The cosmos is to be as one body with the myriad things, as one mind with heaven and earth. Then fierce beasts and blades are but dust and grime of this body—how can they harm me?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Softness and Weakness**\n\nThe Old Master said: Under heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than qi; nothing is softer and weaker than the Dao. Liu said: Though qi is soft and weak, its gathering and scattering occur in due time. The Dao as a thing is without time or accumulation. The reason the Dao is soft and weak is that it envelops heaven and earth and penetrates the myriad things. Wei said: Heaven and earth reside within the empty mystery, yet the emptiness of the empty mystery cannot empty the Dao—thus it envelops heaven and earth. Metal and stone are hard and strong, yet they cannot obstruct the Dao—thus it penetrates the myriad things. Liu said: If it were not soft and weak, how could it envelop and penetrate? Softness gives rise to hardness; weakness gives rise to strength—yet none under heaven know the root and origin from which these arise. Wei said: Softness and weakness are the Dao and qi; hardness and strength are heaven, earth, and the myriad things. The root and origin are the natural Dao. Liu said: The qualities of hardness and strength arise from softness and weakness—each thing possesses them, yet their origin is unknown. This is what is meant by \"the nature and the Dao of heaven cannot be heard.\"\n\nThus being arises from non-being as its mother; non-being arises from emptiness as its mother; emptiness arises from the Dao as its mother. The natural is the root of the Dao. Li said: All things with form must arise from non-being—thus non-being is the mother. Originally there was nothing; because of the existence of being, non-being then came to be. Non-being is fundamentally empty and void. That which gives rise to non-being comes from emptiness—thus emptiness is the mother. Emptiness being empty, how can it circulate and penetrate without obstruction? It is due to the Dao—thus the Dao is the mother. The Dao is neither non-being nor being, neither solid nor empty, neither coming nor going, neither beginning nor ending. It is not made by things, nor created by people. Its origin is unknown—it is called the natural.",
      "overlap_context": " three powers share the same qi. Yet people all pursue the branches and thus harm life. The Old Master guarded the root and thus could attain the Dao. If one can model the sage’s conduct, emptiness and naturalness may be achieved—not by imitating the multitude’s practice of goodness, not by practicing benevolence and righteousness, not by practicing loyalty and trust, not by practicing reverence, not by practicing love and desire. Then the myriad things will come of themselves, bringing benefit.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao arises from the natural, and the natural is thus the root of the Dao. This is called \"non-being giving rise to being,\" each emerging in succession. If one wishes to conclude the preceding with the practice of softness and weakness, it is to give birth to hardness and strength.\n\nLiu said: From the shallow to the profound and wondrous, none know whence it comes—thus it is called the natural.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The People**\nLaozi said: The reason people treat life lightly and die young is that they bring it upon themselves—not because heaven and earth destroy them, nor do ghosts and spirits harm them.\n\nWei said: The greatest things of heaven and earth are life itself; how could they wantonly destroy human life? If one traverses the world with the Dao, even ghosts lose their numinosity—how then could they harm my life? It is because of their knowledge and the movement of their forms.\n\nWei said: Pursuing desires with cleverness and exhausting the body with labor, the form decays and the spirit is depleted—thus they die prematurely midway and do not live out their years.\n\nLiu said: Knowledge gives rise to movement, and movement pursues desires to ruin. They bring it upon themselves—what have ghosts and spirits to do with it? Thus, non-being gives rise to being, and formlessness gives rise to form. Why then would one ruin the completion of their affairs?\n\nXu said: Before a person is born, they originally have no body. Amidst the indistinct and vague, qi transforms, qi transforms into form, and form transforms into life. If one cannot remain pure and inactive, nurturing the spirit and guarding the body to attain long life and enduring vision, how much worse when one loses the principle of nurturing life, acts to incur guilt, and ruins the good work of forming the body, leading to early death?\n\nLiu said: The heart is originally inactive, but emotions and desires arise; the spirit and body are formless, yet form and color emerge. Even from formlessness and inactivity, form and desire arise—how much more so when one completes affairs only to ruin them? Is this not strange?\n\nIf one desires longevity, they must sever emotions and abandon desires, emptying the heart and mind, so that life returns to them.\n\nLi said: Indulging desires harms the body, while severing emotions prolongs life. Abandoning the thoughts of activity, exhausting both inner and outer, the heart and mind are emptied. Years do not come from external circumstances—life resides within oneself, thus it is called \"returning to it.\"\n\nWhen form and spirit unite as one, they can endure long.\n\nLiu said: To preserve life and prevent early death, one must remove emotions and abandon desires, exhausting the heart and mind—then life will naturally return, and no other protection is needed. \"Exhausted\" means complete absence of desire.\n\nLi said: When the soul departs from a person, the body dies; when the spirit unites with the form, life endures.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The World**\nLaozi said: Though one is in the world, let the mind not be in the world; though one is in a state, let the mind not be in the state; though one is in a village, let the mind not be in the village; though one is at home, let the mind not be at home; though the spirit is in the body, let the spirit not be in the body—this is called a person of the Dao.\n\nWei said: Wherever one is, if they forget, then they can be present everywhere.\n\nLiu said: A traveler on a distant journey—who stays to welcome guests? A seeker of truth—who clings to the body? Even the physical form is forgotten, let alone home and state, or even the abandonment of the human and heavenly realms—what purpose would that serve?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Subtlety of Mind**\nLaozi said: Misfortune arises from inattention.\n\nChong said: Those who are wealthy and noble believe themselves joyful and free from worry, but the two words \"inattention\" become the burden and misfortune of their bodies.\n\nDisaster arises from the subtlest threads.\n\n*Thread (si)*: In the versions of Li and Liu, it is written as *private (si)*.\n\nLi said: Rest is a burden to the body, and disaster brings ruin. One does not consider rest as rest, yet rest has already come; one does not consider private matters as disaster, yet disaster has already arrived. People know that in life they truly fear disaster and rest, and though they guard against them all day, they still worry about unexpected calamities. How much less can one who openly does evil avoid them? Thus, the noble person is cautious of the subtle, acting before things arise.\n\nChong said: *Thread* in other versions is mistakenly written as *private*. If one does not fear subtle evils, they will lead to entangling disasters—thus it is said: \"Small faults unaccumulated do not become great faults.\" Therefore, the scripture says: \"When the people do not fear authority, then great authority will come.\"\n\nGood arises from evil.\n\nLiu said: The cause of losing one’s life is the pursuit of a good name.\n\nBenefit arises from harm.\n\nLiu said: The fish that swallows the hook does so for the sake of fragrant bait.\n\nGreat arises from small.\n\nLiu said: A tree that embraces one’s arms begins as a tiny sprout.\n\nDifficulty arises from ease.\n\nLi said: The difficult affairs of the world must begin with the easy.\n\nLiu said: When one first treads on frost, it leads to solid ice.\n\nHigh arises from low.\n\nLi said: A nine-tiered terrace begins with a mound of earth.\n\nDistant arises from near.\n\nLi said: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\n\nOuter arises from inner.\n\nLi said: Because of the inner, the outer exists.\n\nLiu said: Words emerge outwardly, and actions affect the people.\n\nNobility arises from humility.\n\nLi said: From lowliness one attains honor.\n\nLiu said: Nobility takes humility as its root.\n\nMovement arises from stillness.\n\nLi said: From stillness comes movement.\n\nLiu said: Secure the body, then act.\n\nProsperity arises from decline.\n\nLi said: Extreme heat gives rise to cold.\n\nLiu said: When the sun reaches its zenith, it begins to decline.\n\nYin arises from yang.\n\nWei said: Yin and yang are like life and death. If the world were all good without evil, all beneficial without harm, then the name of good would have no cause to arise. Thus, the name of good arises from evil, and the name of benefit arises from harm—all these matters are the burdens of desire and self-interest.\n\nLi said: Extreme stillness gives rise to heat.\n\nLiu said: When the pitch-pipe is exhausted, the tuning pipes follow.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to one another, and emptiness and fullness complete one another.\n\nLi said: Being arises from non-being, and non-being arises from being—thus they give rise to one another. Emptiness is yin, and fullness is yang. Extreme heat becomes cold, and fullness completes emptiness; extreme stillness becomes agitation, and emptiness completes fullness—thus they complete one another.\n\nLiu said: Being is for the sake of benefit, and non-being is for the sake of function.",

The Dao is so subtle that nothing is excluded from it; nothing exists apart from it—thus we know the Dao abides within man.\nFish abide within water, and water abides within fish.\nLiu said: Man’s spirit and qi commune with Heaven and Earth, just as fish, both within and without, depend on water.\nWhen the Dao departs, man dies; when water dries up, fish perish.\nLi said: This is an analogy. The fish’s relation to water is like man’s relation to the Dao: when the Dao is present, man endures; when the Dao departs, man perishes. When water exists, fish live; when water vanishes, fish die. Man must return to the Dao, just as fish must return to water. Thus, man is shaped by the Dao, just as fish are shaped by water. The Dao and water, man and fish—these must never be lost for even a moment.\nTherefore, the sage, knowing this, returns to the state before birth, casting aside extravagance and abandoning excess, severing all care and sorrow.\nWei said: Only by casting aside extravagance can one sever care and sorrow; only when care and sorrow are severed can one return to the state before birth. Once that state is regained, the Dao remains and endures forever.\nLi said: The self-aware must not for a moment lose the Dao. Returning to the state before birth means embracing and guarding the root. Casting aside extravagance means forsaking excess and extremity. Severing care and sorrow means being free of desire and grief. When the heart delights in the Dao, what sorrow can there be?\nThus, when form withdraws, spirit abides.\nLiu said: Still and unmoving.\nAll under Heaven return to it.\nWei said: To withdraw is to be at peace. When form is at peace, spirit remains within it.\nChong said: The forms of this world, though subject to death and transformation, leave behind a body of spirit that abides in the world, transforming things. All under Heaven, admiring its virtue, come to submit and return.\nLi said: When spirit congeals in the nine depths, form is said to withdraw. When the Dao dwells in sagely virtue, spirit is said to abide. Like the wind that arrives when summoned, all come drawn by the Dao, and the myriad regions pay homage—all under Heaven returns to it.\nLiu said: They return to stillness.\nWithout action, without affairs, the state is replete and the people prosper. Preserving the Dao and nurturing constancy—this is called profound unity.\nLi said: Where laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits abound. To refrain from cunning and calculation is called “without action.” To cease adorning weapons and armor is called “without affairs.” Not disturbing things with contrivance but instead pacifying the people with non-action, employing the worthy and wise, allows the hundred clans to flourish and the state to be replete. Turning warhorses to plow the fields, grain and wealth accumulate—thus the people prosper. Guarding the true and upright is called “preserving the Dao.” Progressing day by day is called “nurturing constancy.” Preserving the Dao, one attains the Dao; nurturing constancy, one attains constancy. Penetrating the constant Dao, one achieves profound unity.\nLiu said: When the ruler is without action, the myriad beings are at peace in their occupations. Stores are full, and the people prosper—such is the Dao of perfect governance.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Possessing the State**\nLaozi said: Those who possess a state take root deeply.\nWei said: The king, uniting the four great elements, succeeds Heaven in ordering things—he should take the non-action of the Dao as his root.\nLi said: Taking the Dao as root, what he attains is profound.\nHeaven and Earth cover and bear, nurturing the myriad things. Gold and jade, treasures of great worth, are not hoarded.\nWei said: Heaven and Earth act without action in covering and bearing, and thus they perpetually cover and bear. Thus, gold is hidden in mountains, pearls in the deep—precious treasures cannot escape their bounds. Why store them in treasuries?\nLi said: Those who possess a state should take the Dao as their root and virtue as their foundation. Virtue extends to all without exception; the Dao penetrates all without obstruction. Covered and borne by Heaven and Earth, they preserve their purity and tranquility. Nurtured by the myriad things, they attain enduring longevity. There is no need to accumulate gold and jade, for gold and jade naturally remain.\nLiu said: Heaven and Earth cover and bear of themselves; the myriad things nurture themselves. The sage, rooted deeply in perfect tranquility, regards gold, jade, and treasures as mere qi—discarding and making no use of them.\nTo set aside Heaven and Earth is to possess Heaven and Earth. To set aside one’s body is to preserve life and destiny.\nLi said: To set aside means to forget. Acting with contrivance, the world is lost; practicing the virtue of the Dao, the world is preserved—thus it is said to be possessed. Taking life as possession, love and nurture harm life—thus the body perishes. Able to forget the body, the body unites with the Dao, and life and destiny become boundless—thus the body is preserved.\nLiu said: To forget Heaven and Earth is to be without affairs; without affairs, things return to one. To forget the bodily form is to be without desire; without desire, life is preserved. If even Heaven and Earth and the bodily form are set aside, what need is there to cling to gold, jade, and treasures?\nThus, the noble person excels in what others find unexcellent, delights in what others find joyless, takes pleasure in what others find unpleasurable, does what others find undoable, trusts what others find untrustworthy, and practices what others find unpracticable. Thus, the Dao and its virtue are complete.\nLi said: The scholar of utmost learning studies what others cannot study; the one who establishes conduct does what others cannot do. Whether acting or not acting, all is action; whether studying or not studying, all is study. Teaching reaches all without exception; principle penetrates all without obstruction—thus the Dao and its virtue are complete.",

Extreme heat becomes cold, and fullness completes emptiness; extreme stillness becomes agitation, and emptiness completes fullness—thus they complete one another.\n\nLiu said: Being is for the sake of benefit, and non-being is for the sake of function.",

      "translated_text": "In finer detail, what the vulgar and petty person delights in is action; what the noble person who embraces the Dao delights in is non-action—this is what the good person finds unexcellent. All people take pleasure in sounds and sights, yet I alone take pleasure in soundlessness and formlessness—this is what others find joyless. All people cherish fame and profit, yet I alone forget fame and profit—this is what others find unpleasurable. All people act with attachment, yet I alone act without attachment or aversion—this is what others find undoable. All people trust in the crooked, yet I alone trust in the upright—this is what others find untrustworthy. All people practice evil, yet I alone practice goodness—this is what others find unpracticable. The Dao stands in opposition to the common; its aspirations are lofty, its achievements sublime, its affairs perfectly rounded—thus it is said to be complete.\n\nLiu said: Goodness is goodness without attachment; joy is joy without affairs; pleasure is pleasure without flavor; action is action without acting; trust is trust without intent; practice is the practice of the Dao and its virtue. If these six phrases are not understood and enacted, then the Dao and its virtue are not complete.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\nLaozi said: The Dao is not mine alone—all things possess it.\nWei said: The Dao is present everywhere; how could the sage alone possess it while all things lack it? *Zhuangzi* states: \"The Dao is in excrement and urine.\" If even excrement and urine contain the Dao, how much more so all things!\nLiu said: What is made clear is that the Dao is present everywhere; those who cultivate it attain it. The myriad things do not know it themselves, yet the Dao naturally dwells within them.\nChong said: The myriad things, devoid of knowledge, are equal to straw dogs. They do not know that the sagely craftsman split the great undifferentiated simplicity, scattering it into boundless things. Unable to know the root of their own existence, they are born from the union of the Dao and qi, yet the Dao naturally dwells within them.\nLiu said: It is stored in its function. All people are born through spirit yet do not know that spirit gives birth to them.\nWei said: Not knowing themselves, nor knowing things, the spiritual Dao naturally and obscurely harmonizes. Chong said: Spirit is the root of life’s form; all are born through it yet do not know that spirit gives birth to me, and that spirit itself gives birth to me.\nLiu said: It is near at hand within all bodies, yet they cannot know it. When a lord bestows virtue upon the people, the people do not know they receive the lord’s virtue.\nChong said: When a lord bestows the virtue of non-action upon the people, the people obtain it and use it in their daily lives without awareness, believing it to be natural and not knowing they receive the lord’s virtue.\nWei said: The superior does not know the inferior, the inferior does not know the superior; when superior and inferior forget one another, this is governance by the Dao.\nLiu said: When achievements are complete and affairs are settled, the people all believe it is naturally so. Therefore, the sage conceals spirit within, and the po does not depart.\nChong said: The sage knows that spirit gives birth to me, thus nurtures spirit and guards the body, concealing spirit within form, refining form to transform the po, uniting with true spirit, merging into one. Not enslaved by hun and po, how could they depart?\nLi said: Po is quiescence. The restless and impetuous lose their spirit, but the sage follows the Dao, tranquil and non-active, so spirit does not leave the body, abiding silently within—thus it is said not to depart.\nLiu said: The utmost of stillness. Guard the mother, and the child is preserved.\nLi said: Preserve the Dao and maintain spirit—this is guarding the mother. The body suffers no harm, and the child is preserved. The people flourish, and the state is secured.\nLiu said: When the root is firm, the nation is at peace. The profound and empty accumulates and fills, and life is long.\nChong said: The profound and empty is the Dao. When the true and wondrous qi accumulates and fills my body, one can soar through the void, and life is long. Yet people can know Heaven and Earth and the myriad things but do not know the source of their own existence. To return to life and revert to the root is great ignorance.\nWei said: Life is the natural; the root is the Dao. I am utterly without knowledge, thus can return to unity and revert to the natural.\nLi said: Among sentient beings, humans are the most intelligent. They measure by the sun, draw near to Heaven, observe Earth, and comprehend the principles of things—nothing is unknown, thus they are called wise. Yet they do not know that the body is born of the Dao, return to the root and revert to the origin, clinging to ignorance until death, trusting fate to its end—this is great ignorance.\nLiu said: These are the false learners: though they exhaust teachings and master arts, though their wisdom is vast and their skills many, though they imitate the sagely path with strange doctrines, they do not awaken to the source of life or the Dao of returning to life and reverting to the root. Those who pursue externals may gain a fine reputation in the world, but in themselves, they are called fools.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five**\nLaozi said: The Dao of cultivating the body begins with concealing oneself in Heaven and Earth, dwelling in stillness at the origin of the myriad things.\nWei said: To conceal is to settle. First settle the body and form like Heaven and Earth in non-action, then the heart can dwell at the origin of the myriad things.\nThe origin is the Dao.\nLi said: The principle of cultivating the body must first begin with forgetting form. Once form is forgotten, nothing is seen—this is concealing oneself in Heaven and Earth. Then still the heart and return to the root, dwelling at the origin of the myriad things.\nLiu said: If even Heaven and Earth are concealed, what is there to see? Dwelling at the origin of things, what is there to possess?\nThe sage penetrates the profound origin, blends qi and thought to guard the body.\nXu said: The sage is ever tranquil and non-active, thus can penetrate the profound origin of the Dao, blend spirit and qi, contemplate the true spirit, and thereby guard the true—thus can endure and see far.\nLiu said: The origin is opened and unobstructed; qi and thought are blended yet not disordered.

Both employ things to guard the body, yet their virtue and power differ.\n\nLiu said: The sage’s wisdom and the fool’s emotions follow opposite paths. Though both devote themselves to their work, their uses diverge—one toward beauty, the other toward ugliness. When their deeds reach fulfillment, their effects become manifest.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: Virtue and Power**\n\nLaozi said: Virtue and power sustain Heaven and Earth; water and fire nurture the myriad things. Lofty mountains and deep abysses each have their proper place of return.\n\nLi said: Virtue and power are the subtle principles. What follows—Heaven and Earth, all tangible forms—each has its place of return. This illustrates that the formless Dao, if one can empty the heart and relinquish desire, will naturally come of itself.\n\nThe Dao does not seek emptiness, yet emptiness returns to it;\nVirtue does not seek the numinous, yet the numinous returns to it.\n\nLi said: The Dao is emptiness and non-being; virtue is numinous and wondrous. Emptiness and the numinous, wondrous and still, if one can empty the heart and forget the self, the Dao will naturally return. Embracing the numinous and guarding the wondrous, virtue will naturally return.\n\nLiu said: Emptiness returns to the Dao; the numinous returns to virtue. The Dao proceeds through emptiness; virtue likewise returns through the numinous.\n\nHeaven does not seek clarity, yet clarity returns to it.\nLiu said: That which is light and clear ascends.\n\nEarth does not seek turbidity, yet turbidity returns to it.\nLiu said: That which is heavy and turbid sinks.\n\nMoisture does not seek water, yet water returns to it.\nLiu said: Water flows toward the moist.\n\nDryness does not seek fire, yet fire returns to it.\nLiu said: Fire seeks the dry.\n\nThe myriad things do not seek to be seen in form, yet form reveals itself.\nLiu said: The formless cannot be seen; that which has form cannot be hidden.\n\nLofty mountains and great marshes do not seek flying birds and tigers, yet flying birds and tigers come of themselves.\nLiu said: Feathered and furred creatures return to forests and marshes.\n\nDeep abysses and rivers do not seek fish, turtles, and dragons, yet fish, turtles, and dragons come of themselves.\nLiu said: Like gathers with like; each has its proper dwelling.\n\nIf one can be empty, still, and non-active, though not seeking the Dao, the Dao will return of itself.\nLiu said: Those with agendas scatter their affairs; those who are non-active receive the Dao.\n\nFrom this we see: is not the nature of things spontaneous?\n\nLiu said: Things of the same kind resonate—not by forced division.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Good and Evil**\n\nLaozi said: When the common people do good, I do not know it; when they do evil, I do not know it; when they act with loyalty and trust, I do not know it.\n\nXu said: The four classes of people each have their natural dispositions. Without innate nature, they are difficult to transform—like the blackness of crows or the whiteness of cranes, which are not the work of dyeing or washing.\n\nLi said: The sage extends compassion and opens the way of instruction, urging all to abandon evil deeds and establish good causes, to relinquish falsity and practice loyalty and trust. Yet those lost on the path cannot understand; those who stray do not return. Each follows its karmic lot, drifting in confusion, unable to forget merit and blame, ceaselessly generating good and evil.\n\nThose who do good receive reward; those who do evil incur punishment. The loyal and trustworthy become worthy ministers; the deceitful and cunning become mad rebels. All arise from deeds that are good or evil, and thus names are right or wrong. These are the actions of sentient beings—not what the sage knows. This is expedient teaching; when the time comes, they will awaken of themselves—hence the words \"I do not know.\"\n\nThus, when good is accumulated, good qi arrives; when evil is accumulated, evil qi arrives.\n\nLi said: Earlier, the expedient method spoke of \"not knowing,\" allowing foolish emotions to persist. Fearing that evil roots were not yet severed, this true teaching earnestly clarifies: Without accumulating good, one cannot establish a name; without accumulating evil, one cannot destroy the self. Thus, it is clear that when good is accumulated, good comes; when evil is accumulated, evil arrives—this is no empty claim, but as certain as echo follows sound. Speaking thus is to urge the heart to abandon evil and return to good.\n\nLiu said: The sage’s words make clear that he responds to things without intention—good and evil accumulate of themselves. Who knows them?\n\nTherefore, the sage says: I embrace the beginning of all under Heaven and guard the mother of all under Heaven, and the myriad things increasingly honor me, thereby preserving my body.\n\nLi said: \"I embrace the beginning of all under Heaven\" is to hold the Dao; \"guard the mother of all under Heaven\" is to contain virtue. With virtue and power within, one is revered by others—hence \"increasingly honor.\" Things return to the Dao, and the Dao sustains things. When people and things are preserved, it is said to \"preserve the body.\"\n\nLiu said: When the source is pure, the streams are clear; when the mother is guarded, the children are nourished.\n\nMy mind is always without knowing.\nLiu said: To know is not the way of guarding the mother.\n\nHow then could I know their good and evil deeds?\n\nLi said: The sage forgets the self within and thus has no self or others; hence \"my mind is always without knowing.\" He forgets things without and thus has no good or evil. Both self and others are forgotten—how could he know their good and evil deeds?\n\nLiu said: If one guards the mother yet still knows, how could one know the deeds of the child?\n\nWhen good is accumulated, the spirits assist in its completion.\nWei said: Accumulating good moves the spirits; the spirits naturally assist in its completion—this too I do not know.\n\nHeaven’s way likewise protects good people.\nWei said: Heaven’s way is impartial, yet it constantly aids good people—Heaven likewise does not know.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: Stillness of Mind**\n\nLaozi said: My Dao is tranquil and still.\n\nWei said: This is like dead ashes or withered wood.\n\nWhen the mind is dead, life arises; stillness returns to the mandate.\n\nWei said: Though one does not lose life, the mind is like that of the dead—thus one is ever alive. Because the mind is dead and still, one can return to the natural mandate.\n\nChong said: \"Mind is dead\" means the heart is like cold ashes.\n\nLife arises and accumulates, permeating and nourishing, pouring and lingering.",

      "translated_text": "Li said: Still the mind, quiet the intent, and through the Dao generate life—hence \"generating life.\" The Dao’s flow is unceasing, long moistening the body—thus \"accumulating and permeating.\" The mysterious fluid is the Dharma-water—this is called \"nourishing and pouring.\" Its flow into the body encounters obstructions—hence \"lingering.\" Halted by the Dao—thus \"abiding.\"\n\nLiu said: Accumulating qi and blood to form the body—such is the meaning of \"generating life.\" The mysterious veils and permeating moisture.\n\nLiu said: \"Mysterious veils\" refers to covering the bodily frame. \"Permeating moisture\" means the fluid’s ebb and flow, opening all meridians and vessels.\n\nThe primordial qi envelops it.\nLi said: Quieting the intent from action allows life to preserve itself; stilling the mind to return to the Dao lets the mandate restore itself. By returning to the Dao, one is covered by the Dao—hence \"mysterious veils.\" The numinous fluid flows and moistens—hence \"permeating moisture.\" Human life arises from primordial qi. Cherishing essence and preserving qi, qi never leaves the person; the person lives by qi and is enveloped by it—hence \"envelops it.\"\n\nLiu said: Though life is called the work of spirit, without qi there would be no transformation and nurturing. Its roots grow ever deeper.\n\nWei said: \"Veils\" means covering. All living things arise from the accumulation and permeation of harmonious qi’s nourishing flow, congealing into mysterious veils and permeating moisture. Further enveloped by primordial qi, their roots grow ever deeper, sharing the same origin as the Dao.\n\nChong said: \"Pouring\" is like the fluid in a person’s hands and feet. \"Veils\" means covering. Disciples embrace the primordial and guard the One; their spirit and qi accumulate and fill, permeating the entire body. The nourishing fluid and vital essence linger and abide in the hundred bones. The mysterious Dao covers and shelters, moistening within and without. The primordial Dao-qi envelops their form. The myriad qi endure long, the true spirit anchors and stabilizes—thus their roots grow ever deeper, attaining long life and enduring vision. This forms the fourfold firmness.\n\nLiu said: The true nature is boundless, the bodily frame unharmed. Void of mind within.\n\nWei said: Attaining the great elements of earth, water, and wind, one’s body becomes firm and enduring.\n\nChong said: Sealing the senses and closing the gates, the four faculties of ears, eyes, mouth, and nose remain firm. Worldly dust cannot enter, and the center is empty and void. Thus one can draw forth the essence of the myriad things.\n\nWei said: Though the four elements form the body, within it is tranquil and still, akin to being mindless—thus the essence of the myriad things all return to it.\n\nLi said: Covered by the mysterious Dao, enveloped by primordial qi, the Dao is distant and qi enduring—hence \"its roots grow ever deeper.\" With deep roots and tranquil extremity, existence abides beyond the body. The four great elements remain unbroken—thus \"fourfold firmness.\" Forgetting emotions and emptying the self, within and without are pure and clear, profoundly still and void—this is called \"mindless.\" With body and mind forgotten, all attachments severed, one merges with the realm of emptiness and obtains the essence of the profound and obscure—hence \"drawing forth the essence of the myriad things.\" The things of the boundless naturally return to it.\n\nChong said: Those who cultivate the Dao refine their conduct and practice qi—thus the myriad things, celestial immortals, radiant essences, and luminous spirits, the subtle and wondrous, the boundless and formless Dao, all return of themselves.\n\nFor it is empty, void, and desireless.\nLi said: All tangible things are weak and decaying; the things of the boundless are called \"essence.\" The boundless essence is the true Dao returning to oneself. How is this achieved? Through purity, stillness, and emptiness—thus it arises naturally.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Admonitions**\n\nLaozi said: Listen well, I shall tell you again: the ancient masters are my own body.\n\nChong said: Among Laozi’s ten titles, one is \"Ancient Master.\" Both the *Record of Responses and Titles* and the *Record of Manifest Traces* state: During the era of the Three Sovereigns, he was called Ancient Master. This clarifies that the body of Lord Lao has transformed across the ages. When passing through the pass, he left these words to admonish Yin Xi, hence calling himself the guide of the Western Land, pointing to ascension. When Yin Xi, as his disciple, received the Dao, the transmission of the *Five Thousand Characters* was entrusted to him, along with the oral instructions on the Nine Elixirs and the essentials of the Nine Chambers. About to transform the Western Land and ascend into the Great Subtlety, he wished to reiterate his teachings to resolve Yin Xi’s doubts. Thus he said: \"The ancient masters are my own body,\" dispelling Yin Xi’s uncertainties and revealing the portent of his Western transformation. Later people falsely altered this to \"The ancient masters are my teachers\"—how absurd!\n\nMoreover, the *Annals of Emperors and Kings* record that in the year *dingmao* of King Wen’s reign, Lord Lao was born. In the reign of King Zhao, he resided at the pass. In the twenty-fifth year, *guichou*, he expounded the scripture to Yin Xi. In the twenty-sixth year, the fourth month, he ascended into the Great Subtlety. In the twenty-ninth year, Yin Xi met him again at the Green Sheep Market in Shu, where Lord Lao appeared once more and transformed the Western lands. Later people falsely claimed that during the reigns of Kings Ping, Jing, You, and Li, and King Ding, he entered the Flowing Sands of the West—all erroneous! Why? Yin Xi was a grandee of King Kang’s court. During King Zhao’s reign, he requested to serve as the Pass Keeper to await Lord Lao—clearly not the time of Kings Ping or Jing.\n\nNow I shall return my spirit to the nameless.\nLi said: The nameless is the constant Dao of tranquil realms. Responding to conditions and guiding beings, arising from the true to manifest virtue—when the transformations of the Dao cease, one withdraws and returns to the root, hence \"returning the spirit.\" Coming forth, one manifests form from formlessness; returning, one reverts from the named to the nameless—hence \"returning to the nameless.\"\n\nSever the body, extinguish being, and endure endlessly.\nChong said: \"Spirit\" is the term for the numinous and wondrous. Returning the numinous spirit to the mysterious and void, to emptiness and stillness, nameless and formless—severing the body of this world, extinguishing the form of being, one attains the supreme Dao, enduring endlessly.\n\nLi said: Ceasing transformation and departing from response is called \"severing the body and extinguishing being.\" The Dharma-body remains unmoved, the true Dao congealed and still—this is called \"enduring endlessly.\"",
      "overlap_context": "ness of Mind**\n\nLaozi said: My Dao is tranquil and still.\n\nWei said: This is like dead ashes or withered wood.\n\nWhen the mind is dead, life arises; stillness returns to the mandate.\n\nWei said: Though one does not lose life, the mind is like that of the dead—thus one is ever alive. Because the mind is dead and still, one can return to the natural mandate.\n\nChong said: \"Mind is dead\" means the heart is like cold ashes.\n\nLife arises and accumulates, permeating and nourishing, pouring and lingering.",

      "translated_text": "Now I depart, returning to the One Origin.\n\nLi said: \"Depart\" means to go forth. The Venerable Lord journeyed from the east to the west, hence \"I depart.\" The true Dharma is not one, yet the correct Way is uniquely One. Coming from the east, one returns to the Dao—this is also \"returning to the One Origin.\"\n\nSuddenly, he vanished from sight.\n\nLiu said: Life and death are free and unrestrained, beyond the reckoning of ordinary sentiment.\n\nIn an instant, the lodging blazed with light, its five colors dark and bright.\n\nChong said: The lodging is where past affairs return. During his time in Zhou, the Venerable Lord harmonized his light with the world, subtly advancing and concealing, observing transformations amidst the dust. Hidden among men, he remained unknown. Now, wishing to cease his journey and return to the Origin, to dissolve form and follow transformation, he suddenly vanished from sight. In that instant, the lodging radiated brilliance, illuminating within and without, its five colors dark and bright, startling the eyes and ears.\n\nLi said: \"In an instant\" means in the blink of an eye. The Venerable Lord’s spirit is wondrous and unfathomable, his Dao-power natural. When he can be without being, he suddenly vanishes; when he is not yet has being, he emits five-colored light, shining in all directions. This display of divine transformation serves as a warning to the receiver.\n\nXi emerged into the courtyard, kowtowed, and said: \"I wish the divine one would appear once more and bestow upon me a single essential teaching, that I may preserve the Origin.\"\n\nChong said: Having witnessed the divine transformation, he now recognized the Great Sage. Thus, he came forth into the courtyard, kowtowed, and knocked his head to the ground, wishing only that the divine one would appear again. Though he had received instruction, its meaning was profound and its path long, leaving him uncertain of where to begin. Hence, he sought a single essential teaching to embrace the One and preserve the Origin.\n\nLooking up, he beheld him suspended in the air, seated in emptiness, tens of yards above the earth. His form was that of a golden man—now present, now absent, now dim, now clear; neither old nor young, yet ever-changing.\n\nLi said: With his sincere wish uttered, the Dark Sage was not far. Looking up to the heavens, he immediately saw the Venerable Lord seated upright in the void, exalted high above the earth. His countenance was not that of a hoary-headed elder, his form purely that of a golden body. Sometimes without, sometimes within—hence \"now present, now absent, now dim, now clear.\" Neither great nor small—hence \"neither old nor young, yet ever-changing.\"\n\nHe said: \"I earnestly admonish you—guard this well.\"\n\nRong said: He again expounded the wondrous Dharma, instructing him to preserve the Way.\n\nEliminate defilement, cease thoughts, still the mind, and guard the One.\n\nLi said: The entanglements of conditioned existence, the filth of the human realm, the waves of discriminating thought, the delusions of love and aversion—all are defilements, commonly called \"dust.\" Restrain the passions, endure sensory pleasures, comprehend being and penetrate non-being, and sweep all away—hence \"eliminate.\" Let the mind be free of clutter—hence \"cease thoughts.\" Neither attached within nor without—hence \"still the mind.\" Concentrate the spirit on the Dao, focus the will without division—hence \"guard the One.\"\n\nLiu said: Whatever is not true nature is defilement. Cease the workings of the mind, and all defilements are eliminated. Guard the One without wavering, and the true mind becomes still.\n\nWhen all defilements are eliminated, all affairs are complete.\n\nLi said: When the hundred evils are dissolved, they are said to be \"eliminated.\" When the ten thousand virtues are fully realized, they are said to be \"complete.\" The essential teaching of my Way—once the earnest admonition is finished, he immediately vanished.\n\nLi said: Earlier, he was instructed to embrace the Origin and guard the One, admonished to eliminate defilement and cease thoughts. When deluded thoughts are stilled, right action arises. One may thereby perfect truth, attain the Dao, govern the household, and transform the state—no affair is impossible, hence \"complete.\" The Dark Origin responds to things, fundamentally to save people. When people follow the teachings, no principle remains unfulfilled. When things are saved and people delivered, virtue perfectly transforms and provides. Following form, he entered stillness—hence \"vanished.\"\n\nXi, not knowing where he had gone, wept in longing and remembrance. He resigned his office, feigning illness.\n\nLi said: The Sage entered the wondrous, his whereabouts unfathomable. Gazing up in reverence, he shed tears; yearning to leave worldly affairs, he returned to non-action, hence his pretense of illness.\n\nAbandon thoughts and guard the One—all affairs are complete.\n\nLi said: Hold the precepts in the heart, establish conduct according to the scriptures, and seek nothing beyond—this is \"guarding the One.\" When the dust of entanglement is exhausted, the true Dao of non-action naturally manifests. With wisdom full and virtue replete, the ten thousand practices are all perfected—hence \"complete.\"\n\n*End of Collected Commentaries on the* Scripture of Western Ascension, *Fascicle Six*\n\n[Note: #1 The phrase \"Water and the Dao, people and fish\" should read \"People and the Dao, water and fish.\"\n#2 \"Obtained earth, water, and great wind\" should read \"Obtained earth, water, fire, and wind.\"\n#3 This line in the *Imperially Commissioned Commentary of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"Because it is empty and desireless.\"\n#4 \"The essential teaching of my Way, once the earnest admonition is finished, he immediately vanished\" in the *Imperially Commissioned Commentary of the Zhenghe Era* reads: \"The essential teaching of my Way.
