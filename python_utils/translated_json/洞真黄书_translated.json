  "full_translation": "**The Yellow Book of Cavernous Perfection**\n\n**Title:** *The Yellow Book of Cavernous Perfection* (*Dongzhen Huangshu*). Author unknown, approximately dating to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. A manual of early Celestial Master Daoist bedroom cultivation techniques. One scroll. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Zhengyi Section, First Division.\n\n---\n\nThe Master said: I wish to expound the Great Measure of Heaven and Earth and the Eight Generations Method. Heaven and Earth unite in the Six Harmonies, and humans unite in the Six Harmonies. The man rides the *jiazi*, *jiachen*, and *jiayin* [days], while the man returns to *guihai*. The Three Harmonies complete virtue, and they mutually pair with the Eight Generations to form the Great Measure.\n\nThe Yellow Book’s Eight *Qi* correspond to twenty-four spirit-persons. Three spirit-persons and three spirit-venerables align with the Three-One *Qi* to match their *qi*. Husband and wife unite essence to form the spirit, and the moon generates [life]. On the first day, *guichou* and *guimao* are obtained—yin’s generative *qi* splits into two halves to become one. Together, they may transcend calamity and dispel illness. What is sought aligns with the generative *qi* of Laozi. Simply practice the Nine-One [method], and do not recklessly expend [essence].\n\nOn the second day, *jiachen* is obtained—Heaven and Earth’s generative *qi* unite in yang.\nOn the third day, *yisi*—the Great Measure of yin and yang.\nOn the fourth day, *bingwu*—Laozi ascends in broad daylight. Clouds part to bestow the Four *Qi*. Man and woman unite in the Three Harmonies. The woman rides *jiawu*, *jiashen*, and *jiaxu*, while the woman returns to *guisi*. The Three Harmonies correspond to the twelve hours. Each rides the twelve and twenty-four *qi*. The man’s *qi* is white; the woman’s *qi* is yellow. One for the man, two for the woman; three on the left, six on the right. Begin with *jiayin* and *guichou*, then return on *guiyou*.\n\nThe man’s three [days] begin with *guimao* and return on *jiachen*. *Yisi* exits the Gate of Heaven and enters the Door of Earth. Earth upholds the Heavenly Pillar as the true [axis]. Passing through *wu* and *ji*, the primordial firmness guards itself. If one seeks livelihood, traverse the Three and Five—do not exceed Seven and Nine.\n\n*Guihai*: five fives, twenty-five *qi*.\n*Guisi*: eight eights, sixty-four *qi*.\n*Guimao*: nine nines, eighty-one *qi*.\n*Guiyou*: six sixes, thirty-six *qi*.\n*Guichou*: three fives, fifteen *qi*.\n*Guiwei*: three fives, fifteen *qi*.\n\n*Jiazi*: five *qi* bestowed.\n*Jiawu*: eight *qi* bestowed.\n*Jiayin*: nine *qi* bestowed.\n*Jiachen*: nine *qi* bestowed.\n*Jiashen*: six *qi* bestowed.\n*Jiaxu*: six *qi* bestowed.\n\nThe Dao emerges from Three, Five, Seven, and Nine. In the first year of *Han’an* (*renwu*, 142 CE), the Celestial Master received from Laozi, with bowed head, *The Yellow Book* in eight scrolls, the Red *Qi*’s Three *Qi* and Nine Talismans, the Seven Talismans, each with one Mysterious Register, one *Hunchen* and one *Zhongzhang*, and the Three Spirit Registers. Orally transmitted on the twenty-fourth day, *yisi*, at noon, the twenty-four scrolls of the *Lidu* were passed down. By the twenty-fourth day, *jisi*, the oral transmission was completed to Sheng, Zhang, Zhi, and Ying. The Great Measure of Heaven and Earth was proclaimed. All must clearly discern and select the person, select the bones, and select the virtue. Only when one is willing to die as proof may the two scrolls be transmitted.\n\nThe spirits must not be recklessly bestowed. The Six *Jia*, Five Phases, Twenty-Four *Qi*, Nine Palaces, Eight Trigrams, yin-yang’s measure of the world, dispelling disaster and preserving life, ingesting the Three Subtleties—*The Secret Scripture of the Void and Primordial*, Scroll Eight—must not be recklessly transmitted.\n\n---\n\n**The Five Phases and Their Pairings:**\nEast: *jia-yi* Wood.\nWest: *geng-xin* Metal. Wood fears Metal. *Jia* offers his younger sister; *yi* is paired with the West’s *geng*. *Geng* and *yi* become husband and wife.\n\nSouth: *bing-ding* Fire.\nNorth: *ren-gui* Water. Fire fears Water. *Bing* offers his younger sister; *ding* is paired with the North’s *ren*. *Ren* and *ding* become husband and wife.\n\nNorth: *ren-gui* Water.\nCenter: *wu-ji* Earth. Water fears Earth. *Ren* offers his younger sister; *gui* is paired with the Center’s *wu*. *Wu* and *gui* become husband and wife.\n\nCenter: *wu-ji* Earth.\nEast: *jia-yi* Wood. Earth fears Wood. *Wu* offers his younger sister; *ji* is paired with the East’s *jia*. *Jia* and *ji* become husband and wife.\n\nWest: *geng-xin* Metal.\nSouth: *bing-ding* Fire. Metal fears Fire. *Geng* offers his younger sister; *xin* is paired with the South’s *bing*. *Bing* and *xin* become husband and wife.\n\n---\n\n**Seasonal Observations:**\nIn the three months of spring, the East’s Wood reigns. *Jia* offers his younger sister *yi* as *geng*’s wife. When the ruling phase of the household holds the West’s Metal and returns to the East to generate, Metal overcomes Wood—hence the elm’s pods split, marking the subtle yin’s slaying.\n\nIn the three months of summer, the South’s Fire reigns. *Bing* offers his younger sister *ding* as *ren*’s wife. When the ruling phase of the household holds the North’s Water and returns to the South to generate, Water delights in extinguishing Fire—hence the slaying of shepherd’s purse and wheat.\n\nIn the three months of autumn, the West’s Metal reigns. *Geng* offers his younger sister *xin* as *bing*’s wife. When the ruling phase of the household holds the South’s Fire and returns to the West to generate, Fire dissolves Metal—yet like a completed vessel, the harvest repays the earth.\n\nIn the three months of winter, the North’s Water reigns. *Ren* offers his younger sister *gui* as the Center’s *wu*’s wife. When the ruling phase of the household holds the Center’s Earth and returns to the North to generate, Earth delights in generating the myriad things. Thus, at the winter solstice, all things stir within the yellow springs. Hence, the *Yijing* says, “The hidden dragon does not act.” The *Xiaojing Yuan Shen Qi* states: “The dark ford first intertwines, suddenly sprouting buds”—this is what it means.\n\n---\n\n**The Eight Trigrams:**\n**In Heaven:**\n*Qian* is Heaven, the One.\n*Kun* is the Celestial Handle.\n*Zhen* is Abundant Dragon.\n*Xun* is Beckoning.\n*Kan* is the Salty Pond.\n*Li* is the Chariot of the Yellow Emperor.\n*Gen* is the Form-Time.\n*Dui* is the Manifest-Time.\n\n**On Earth:**\n*Qian* is metal and stone.\n*Kun* is earth.\n*Zhen* is wood.\n*Xun* is grass.\n*Kan* is water.\n*Li* is fire.\n*Gen* is mountain.\n*Dui* is marsh.\n\n**In Humans:**\n*Qian* is the head.\n*Kun* is the abdomen.\n*Zhen* is the feet.\n*Li* is the eyes.\n*Xun* is the nose (also the thighs).\n*Gen* is the hands.\n*Kan* is the ears.\n*Dui* is the mouth.\n\n---\n\n**The Generation of the Eight Trigrams:**\nThey arise from the Nine Palaces. One must hold forty-five counting rods, placing them at *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*, and the center—nine each. Then call out:\n“Water flows to the end, dividing eight to *chou*;\nWood falls to the root, dividing six to *hai*;\nMetal is hard, Fire is strong, dividing two to *wei*;\nEarth reigns in the four seasons, dividing four to *si*.”\n\nThe positions form two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet; three on the left, seven on the right; nine worn on the head, one trodden underfoot; five in the Central Palace. The master conceals the abdomen, filling *xun*. Call the Gate of Heaven: from *qian*, obtain one; from *gen*, eight. Raise *li* to scatter three; from *kun*, *zhen* thunders; from *dui*, the marsh. From *dui*, obtain two; *kan*’s water is not alone—six. From *li*, obtain four; the positions complete three and five equally.\n\nIf *zhen*’s yang and *kan*’s *gen* each take their positions, *xun*’s yin, *li*, and *dui* each have their places. One *qian* should become *kun*; one returns. Eight, nine, and five reside in the Central Palace, each trigram in its position.\n\nOn the first day of the lunar month, one and nine; on the second day, two and nine; on the third day, three and nine; on the fourth day, four and nine; on the fifth day, five and nine; on the sixth day, six and nine; on the seventh day, seven and nine; on the eighth day, eight and nine; on the ninth day, nine nines—eighty-one—brings rain at midday.\n\nFrom the tenth day, proceed with three, five, seven, and nine; on the eleventh day, proceed with three, five, seven, and nine; on the twelfth day, proceed with three, five, seven, and nine; on the thirteenth day, proceed with three, five, seven, and nine; on the fourteenth day, proceed with three, five, seven, and nine; on the fifteenth day, proceed with three, five, seven, and nine. These form the six harmonies of the sun and moon. During this period, rain must not fall recklessly—if it does, calamity will follow. Be cautious, be cautious.\n\nFrom the sixteenth day, proceed with eight eights; on the seventeenth day, seven eights; on the eighteenth day, six eights; on the nineteenth day, five eights; on the twentieth day, four eights; on the twenty-first day, three eights; on the twenty-second day, two eights; on the twenty-third day, one eight. Within this ten-day period, a single rain is permissible. This is the movement of Heaven and Earth, husband and wife, yin and yang. The remaining seven and eight belong to *wu* and *ji*; they must not act recklessly but each guard their own bound qi, mutually containing and generating life. Choose the right moment—beware of transgression.\n\nThe master says: The eight trigrams and nine palaces, the moon’s six *jia* days, yin and yang in union, the six harmonies and eight births, the great measure of the eight winds, the twenty-four rains, the application of three and five, the calamities of seven and nine. When three and five are applied as the child, and seven and five as calamity, three before and two after, three—eight winds and eight qi in union. The Upper Prime is one, the Middle Prime is two, the Lower Prime is three; nine and one arise within them. The eight winds and twenty-four rains extend in one application. For ten days, only wind and qi descend. The embryo’s breath holds one thousand two hundred qi. On the sixteenth day, three qi descend like rain. The great measure of Heaven and Earth unites the three primes’ qi. On the twenty-fourth day, only wind and qi. *Jiazi* holds five qi, three and five; *jiashen*, six qi, three and five; *jiawu*, eight qi, three and five; *jiaxu*, six qi, three and five. *Guiyou* has abundant yin qi; *guimao*, abundant yang qi; *guisi*, abundant yin qi; *guihai*, abundant yang qi. *Jiachen* holds nine qi, three and five; *guichou*, abundant yang qi; *jiayin*, nine qi, three and five; *guiwei*, abundant yang qi.\n\n*Guiyou* and *guimao* are the great measure of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang in union. If one can clearly understand the six harmonies of yin and yang rotating in mutual pairing, avoid the taboos of three, five, and six harmonies, and seven, nine, and six harmonies. Left holds three qi, right holds six qi. Three, five, seven, and nine correspond with the twenty-four spirit-persons. The three and five proceed: left to the Upper Prime, right to the Mysterious Elder, center to the Supreme Great One. Calamities and illnesses hold one thousand two hundred qi; minor illnesses, two, five, seven, and nine. To nurture nature and preserve life, avoid celestial illnesses. The three and five are essential; five qi are most authentic. Seven and nine qi bring illness and calamity. Reflect thrice—do not transgress.\n\nThe master says: The eight trigrams and nine palaces, the moon’s six *jia* days, yin and yang in union, the six harmonies and eight births, the great measure of the eight winds and twenty-four rains, the application of three and five, the calamities of seven and nine. The five phases’ prohibitions for men and women. If one can apply them as the Mysterious Register, qi blends in primordial chaos, the yellow and white qi—capable of mutual destruction and mutual generation. Cultivate the body, contemplate goodness, and simply desire to live joyfully. In urgency, apply them. Fearing you may not understand, I set forth the method of the three descending qi, beginning from *renwu* and *guiwei*. In the first year of *Han’an*, on the tenth day of the first month at noon, the eight-scroll *Mysterious Register of Primordial Chaos* was revealed. It admonishes men and women not to recklessly apply talismans and contracts, dispelling old qi, corpse infestations, and ghosts. To speak of calamities and illnesses is to transcend the world—passing through with red qi, ascending at midday on *wu* and *ji*, clouds and dragons inverted and severed. Beyond rain, raise both hands above the head three times. Depart from the old Jade Chamber, return to the Eight Darknesses, untie the sixteen knots, and contemplate the eight qi to dissolve and generate qi. Qi is applied: the father generates the Supreme Mystery Palace, the mother generates the Supreme Subtlety Palace. The father is born on *bingyin*, the mother on *bingshen*. Before Heaven and Earth were established, the yellow and white were distinguished. Together, they apply the nine nines—eighty-one qi, each qi weighing two and a half taels. One on the left, the Upper Prime; one on the right, the Mysterious Elder; three in the center, the Supreme Great One—three nines, twenty-seven; nine nines, eighty-one.\n\nThus, men and women first two, then three—this is the three and five child. Together, reflect thrice on the central chapter of the abdomen and eyes. Three births and three risings become three births; three risings and three lyings become three deaths. One’s life depends on qi—do not transgress.\n\nThe master says: When the positions of three and five are established, the calamities of seven and nine are dispelled. First apply three and one; two, four, and nine generate qi. Qi, like three united, forms virtue—contemplate this, do not apply recklessly.\n\nThe Dao: From the first to the ninth day of the lunar month, contemplate the Primordial Qi of the Mysterious Origin in the head and eyes. The head holds the eight trigrams; the human body, the twenty-four spirits and the three, five, seven, and nine. Knowing this, the body may transcend.\n\nThe Dao: After the ten-day period of the lunar month, the numbers three, five, seven, and nine. From the tenth to the fifteenth day, proceed daily with three, five, seven, and nine. These are the six harmonies of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. The sun and moon must be clear—rain must not fall recklessly. Calamities may be averted; rain brings harm, withering roots and rotting seeds. Not understanding the methods of three and five, recklessly applying seven and nine—this is like a fish out of water, a person deprived of qi. Rain brings harm—be cautious, be cautious.\n\nThe Dao: From the sixteenth day of the lunar month, apply eight eights down to one eight. Within this ten-day period, a single rain is permissible. The waning moon belongs to *wu* and *ji*; seven and eight may bring wind but not rain. On the twenty-eighth day, it must cease. If one cannot apply three and five together but only proceeds with three, five, seven, and nine corresponding to the twenty-four spirits, not corresponding to the Upper Prime on the left, the Mysterious Elder on the right, and the Supreme Great One in the center—three and one are the correct qi of the Three Officials. The one before and two after are the Upper and Middle Primes. Lie back together, feet apart, inhaling and exhaling to the utmost limit of the primordial. Three completions transcend *wu* and *ji*. The infant’s embryo breath holds one thousand two hundred qi. If the body is afflicted by calamities and illnesses, they cannot be dispelled. Then contemplate the twenty-four spirits of the upper and lower cinnabar fields, and also contemplate them together with the three and five spirits. Men contemplate on the left, women on the right. Do not transmit recklessly—choose the right person. Be cautious, be cautious.\n\nThe Dao aligns with the twelve months to harmonize the great measures of yin and yang, enacting the eightfold generative method by which the mysterious qi descends. The primordial qi ascends, and the spirit-qi of men and women each bears its name. These spirits may together traverse calamities and illnesses. Receive the four true characters, and the eight-character name aligned with qi. The Dao emerges from profound obscurity, enters into deep mystery. When the three and five qi rectify the body, one attains the divine immortality of emperors and kings in perfect peace—ten thousand times not one life is lost. Men possess three qi, women five qi; men possess twelve qi, women twelve qi. The twelve hours correspond to each, each firming their own spirits. The male spirit is Wang Wenqing, Zhou Zuosong; the female spirit is Wei Shangqing, Zhou Shigonglai. Thus the heart becomes luminous—do not transgress.\n\nThe Dao generates the six directions; when one wishes to pass through the five perils and traverse all calamities, dispelling epidemic qi and ceaseless oral afflictions, first contemplate the spirits of the *jiazi* lords. Follow the day to name its spirit; if the spirit is the peril, the Heavenly Bureau removes the Three Officials’ investigations. If one does not recite the spirit’s chapter and swear above, the years, months, and days will not resolve in their coming and going. The male official rides the sixty spirits; when the day of the yin spirit arrives, it may be summoned for service. When the day of the yang spirit arrives, it may also be summoned. The yang spirit resides five days in the yin household, the yin spirit five days in the yang household—thus the two mutually contain each other. Today is the *jiazi* day: contemplate the spirit to return the Six Rong and Ten Spirits to serve as messengers. Today is the *jiawu* day: contemplate the spirit to return the Nine Yi and Ten Spirits to serve as messengers. Thus the *zi* and *wu* generals govern the return of the six *gui* spirits. One who understands the six *gui* may traverse all affairs. Men and women each preserve their own spirits; qi must not be recklessly deployed. Within lies the undying Dao—let the emperor himself thrice reflect.\n\nThe Dao of the sun generates what is not yet manifest. First prepare the spirits of *jiazi*, then the twenty-four spirits. From the first day of the first month, follow the day’s name and title through the twelfth month—men’s and women’s spirit-qi share the same unity. Lose one, and life is incomplete. Thus establish the spirit’s position, following the month to enact it. Do not err or miscall others, lest they fail to serve in coming and going. When treating illness and epidemic qi, one should personally invoke the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, joining forces with the day’s spirit to assist. The Daoist Wang Jia enacts the three, five, seven, and nine. If you can receive my true words and essential teachings, you must share them with an enlightened master’s oral instructions, the upper and lower Nine Palaces, the trigrams, talismans, charts, registers, and scriptures. In the seventh month, seventh day, at noon of the Han An era’s first year, the Most High Lord Lao bestowed these upon Zhang Ling. The essential oral transmission grants long life, deliverance from the world, corpse liberation, and ascension to heaven in broad daylight. Descendants may traverse generations, passing through all calamities. In the second year, the year *guiwei*, on the seventh day of the first month at noon, Dao Ling transmitted these to Zhao Sheng, Wang Zhang, and Wang Ying, enacting the Yellow Writs, talismanic commands, Nine Palaces prohibitions, and the knowledge of male and female officials and spirits as treated in the eighth scroll. Essential teachings emerge from within. Sheng and the others transmitted these to the Three Ladies at the Northern Prosperity Abbey on Mount Zhuang, distinguishing the scrolls and contracts. First, the oral instructions of the Red Qi were bestowed: the proper enactment of the three, five, seven, and nine in the six directions of heaven and earth, with men and women each following their own spirits. Even the length of garments must be contemplated together, so each spirit guards its own. Heaven’s commands err in mutual confusion at human birth—first concentrate the spirit, as if contemplating the brain and marrow to complete the bones, firming the net of destiny. Untie the sixteen knots; the spirit’s hands pass over the head and stop. Do not transmit recklessly—be cautious, be cautious.\n\nThe master said: The Nine Yi of heaven and earth, the Eight Man, the Six Rong, the Five Di, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the Six Substances summoned for investigation, the Twenty-Four Lords of the Officials, the Heavenly Master, Female Master, and Lineage Master—Three Master Lords—the generals of the Three Heavens: the Great Red Heaven Unity, the Pure Tenuity Heaven Unity, and the Yu Yu Heaven Unity. One who understands the three qi and three-five may together traverse perils, escape the fate of years, and dispel epidemic illness. Essential teachings are transmitted orally, not in writing. According to the male official’s twenty-four qi and the female official’s twenty-four qi, the spirit registers and mysterious registers merge in the central chapter—do not transmit these without selecting the right person.\n\nOne who understands this nine-by-nine may dispel disasters and disperse misfortunes. Within lie the three microcosms of ingested substances. Without knowing the old reckoning of the three qi—*jiachen* and *guimao* begin this as true—*jiawu*, *yiwei*, and *bingshen* mark the sixty-year cycle. I fear you may drive away evil rebellions to no lasting effect. One may guard the One, not change thrice. The *jiawu* Dao issues forth (from itself). On the seventh day of the first month, at noon, it descends.\n\nBy birth year, receive the three qi, left and right. [Name] disperses the twenty-four spirit names and titles. The Six Rong’s six-by-six thirty-six, the Red Qi’s Three Lords of the Great Red Heaven. The Most High Red Qi speaks of the Heavenly Bureau [Name]. Ascending to heaven, the body light, emerging from the eight poles. The *chou* hour’s twelve-hour lords and officers each join. Revering the Pure Mystery Prime, the Upper Three Heavenly Lords array above. *Bingyin* mother, *bingshen* father Mu—[Name] acts, yet the mother’s gate remains. Qi, wishing to invite the Eight Man of the south, eight, eight sixty-four qi. Wishing to invite the west’s officers and lords, together with the twelve-hour lords. Supervising the passage of the Red [Name], first write. One hundred twenty officials and generals each traverse together. All spirits, worthy ones, the three qi of yin’s remnants. Disasters pass through my five perils. [Name] is born, should pass *wu* and *ji*, the body attains whiteness. *Maochen* south, *siyi* south, *wuxi* west, *shenyou* west, *xu* north, *hai* and *zi* north. The seventh day of the seventh month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the seventh day of the first month—without these, life has no reception.\n\nThe Eight Man of the South, Tang Shangqing;\nThe Six Rong of the West, Hu Gongyang;\nThe Five Di of the North, Pang Mingxin.\n\nThe Eight Man of the South, Wei Shangqing;\nThe Six Rong of the West, Kong Ligong;\nThe Five Di of the North, Wang Wenqing.\n\nThe Eight Man of the South, Du Zhongyang;\nThe Six Rong of the West, Zhan Zijiang;\nThe Five Di of the North, Pang Jiqing.\n\nLeft male, right female—three qi;\nLeft male, right female—three qi;\nLeft male, right female—three qi.\n\nThe *Dongzhen Huangshu* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**The Yellow Book of Cavernous Perfection**\n\n**Title:** *The Yellow Book of Cavernous Perfection* (*Dongzhen Huangshu*). Author unknown, approximately dating to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. A manual of early Celestial Master Daoist bedroom cultivation techniques. One scroll. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Zhengyi Section, First Division.\n\n---\n\nThe Master said: I wish to expound the Great Measure of Heaven and Earth and the Eight Generations Method. Heaven and Earth unite in the Six Harmonies, and humans unite in the Six Harmonies. The man rides the *jiazi*, *jiachen*, and *jiayin* [days], while the man returns to *guihai*. The Three Harmonies complete virtue, and they mutually pair with the Eight Generations to form the Great Measure.\n\nThe Yellow Book’s Eight *Qi* correspond to twenty-four spirit-persons. Three spirit-persons and three spirit-venerables align with the Three-One *Qi* to match their *qi*. Husband and wife unite essence to form the spirit, and the moon generates [life]. On the first day, *guichou* and *guimao* are obtained—yin’s generative *qi* splits into two halves to become one. Together, they may transcend calamity and dispel illness. What is sought aligns with the generative *qi* of Laozi. Simply practice the Nine-One [method], and do not recklessly expend [essence].\n\nOn the second day, *jiachen* is obtained—Heaven and Earth’s generative *qi* unite in yang.\nOn the third day, *yisi*—the Great Measure of yin and yang.\nOn the fourth day, *bingwu*—Laozi ascends in broad daylight. Clouds part to bestow the Four *Qi*. Man and woman unite in the Three Harmonies. The woman rides *jiawu*, *jiashen*, and *jiaxu*, while the woman returns to *guisi*. The Three Harmonies correspond to the twelve hours. Each rides the twelve and twenty-four *qi*. The man’s *qi* is white; the woman’s *qi* is yellow. One for the man, two for the woman; three on the left, six on the right. Begin with *jiayin* and *guichou*, then return on *guiyou*.\n\nThe man’s three [days] begin with *guimao* and return on *jiachen*. *Yisi* exits the Gate of Heaven and enters the Door of Earth. Earth upholds the Heavenly Pillar as the true [axis]. Passing through *wu* and *ji*, the primordial firmness guards itself. If one seeks livelihood, traverse the Three and Five—do not exceed Seven and Nine.\n\n*Guihai*: five fives, twenty-five *qi*.\n*Guisi*: eight eights, sixty-four *qi*.\n*Guimao*: nine nines, eighty-one *qi*.\n*Guiyou*: six sixes, thirty-six *qi*.\n*Guichou*: three fives, fifteen *qi*.\n*Guiwei*: three fives, fifteen *qi*.\n\n*Jiazi*: five *qi* bestowed.\n*Jiawu*: eight *qi* bestowed.\n*Jiayin*: nine *qi* bestowed.\n*Jiachen*: nine *qi* bestowed.\n*Jiashen*: six *qi* bestowed.\n*Jiaxu*: six *qi* bestowed.\n\nThe Dao emerges from Three, Five, Seven, and Nine. In the first year of *Han’an* (*renwu*, 142 CE), the Celestial Master received from Laozi, with bowed head, *The Yellow Book* in eight scrolls, the Red *Qi*’s Three *Qi* and Nine Talismans, the Seven Talismans, each with one Mysterious Register, one *Hunchen* and one *Zhongzhang*, and the Three Spirit Registers. Orally transmitted on the twenty-fourth day, *yisi*, at noon, the twenty-four scrolls of the *Lidu* were passed down. By the twenty-fourth day, *jisi*, the oral transmission was completed to Sheng, Zhang, Zhi, and Ying. The Great Measure of Heaven and Earth was proclaimed. All must clearly discern and select the person, select the bones, and select the virtue. Only when one is willing to die as proof may the two scrolls be transmitted.\n\nThe spirits must not be recklessly bestowed. The Six *Jia*, Five Phases, Twenty-Four *Qi*, Nine Palaces, Eight Trigrams, yin-yang’s measure of the world, dispelling disaster and preserving life, ingesting the Three Subtleties—*The Secret Scripture of the Void and Primordial*, Scroll Eight—must not be recklessly transmitted.\n\n---\n\n**The Five Phases and Their Pairings:**\nEast: *jia-yi* Wood.\nWest: *geng-xin* Metal. Wood fears Metal. *Jia* offers his younger sister; *yi* is paired with the West’s *geng*. *Geng* and *yi* become husband and wife.\n\nSouth: *bing-ding* Fire.\nNorth: *ren-gui* Water. Fire fears Water. *Bing* offers his younger sister; *ding* is paired with the North’s *ren*. *Ren* and *ding* become husband and wife.\n\nNorth: *ren-gui* Water.\nCenter: *wu-ji* Earth. Water fears Earth. *Ren* offers his younger sister; *gui* is paired with the Center’s *wu*. *Wu* and *gui* become husband and wife.\n\nCenter: *wu-ji* Earth.\nEast: *jia-yi* Wood. Earth fears Wood. *Wu* offers his younger sister; *ji* is paired with the East’s *jia*. *Jia* and *ji* become husband and wife.\n\nWest: *geng-xin* Metal.\nSouth: *bing-ding* Fire. Metal fears Fire. *Geng* offers his younger sister; *xin* is paired with the South’s *bing*. *Bing* and *xin* become husband and wife.\n\n---\n\n**Seasonal Observations:**\nIn the three months of spring, the East’s Wood reigns. *Jia* offers his younger sister *yi* as *geng*’s wife. When the ruling phase of the household holds the West’s Metal and returns to the East to generate, Metal overcomes Wood—hence the elm’s pods split, marking the subtle yin’s slaying.\n\nIn the three months of summer, the South’s Fire reigns. *Bing* offers his younger sister *ding* as *ren*’s wife. When the ruling phase of the household holds the North’s Water and returns to the South to generate, Water delights in extinguishing Fire—hence the slaying of shepherd’s purse and wheat.\n\nIn the three months of autumn, the West’s Metal reigns. *Geng* offers his younger sister *xin* as *bing*’s wife. When the ruling phase of the household holds the South’s Fire and returns to the West to generate, Fire dissolves Metal—yet like a completed vessel, the harvest repays the earth.\n\nIn the three months of winter, the North’s Water reigns. *Ren* offers his younger sister *gui* as the Center’s *wu*’s wife. When the ruling phase of the household holds the Center’s Earth and returns to the North to generate, Earth delights in generating the myriad things. Thus, at the winter solstice, all things stir within the yellow springs. Hence, the *Yijing* says, “The hidden dragon does not act.” The *Xiaojing Yuan Shen Qi* states: “The dark ford first intertwines, suddenly sprouting buds”—this is what it means.\n\n---\n\n**The Eight Trigrams:**\n**In Heaven:**\n*Qian* is Heaven, the One.\n*Kun* is the Celestial Handle.\n*Zhen* is Abundant Dragon.\n*Xun* is Beckoning.\n*Kan* is the Salty Pond.\n*Li* is the Chariot of the Yellow Emperor.\n*Gen* is the Form-Time.\n*Dui* is the Manifest-Time.\n\n**On Earth:**\n*Qian* is metal and stone.\n*Kun* is earth.\n*Zhen* is wood.\n*Xun* is grass.\n*Kan* is water.\n*Li* is fire.\n*Gen* is mountain.\n*Dui* is marsh.\n\n**In Humans:**\n*Qian* is the head.\n*Kun* is the abdomen.\n*Zhen* is the feet.\n*Li* is the eyes.\n*Xun* is the nose (also the thighs).\n*Gen* is the hands.\n*Kan* is the ears.\n*Dui* is the mouth.\n\n---\n\n**The Generation of the Eight Trigrams:**\nThey arise from the Nine Palaces. One must hold forty-five counting rods, placing them at *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*, and the center—nine each. Then call out:\n“Water flows to the end, dividing eight to *chou*;\nWood falls to the root, dividing six to *hai*;\nMetal is hard, Fire is strong, dividing two to *wei*;\nEarth reigns in the four seasons, dividing four to *si*.”\n\nThe positions form two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet; three on the left, seven on the right; nine worn on the head, one trodden underfoot; five in the Central Palace. The master conceals the abdomen, filling *xun*. Call the Gate of Heaven: from *qian*, obtain one; from *gen*, eight. Raise *li* to scatter three; from *kun*, *zhen* thunders; from *dui*, the marsh. From *dui*, obtain two; *kan*’s water is not alone—six. From *li*, obtain four; the positions complete three and five equally.\n\nIf *zhen*’s yang and *kan*’s *gen* each take their positions, *xun*’s yin, *li*, and *dui* each have their places. One *qian* should become *kun*; one returns. Eight, nine, and five reside in the Central Palace, each trigram in its position.",

These form the six harmonies of the sun and moon. During this period, rain must not fall recklessly—if it does, calamity will follow. Be cautious, be cautious.\n\nFrom the sixteenth day, proceed with eight eights; on the seventeenth day, seven eights; on the eighteenth day, six eights; on the nineteenth day, five eights; on the twentieth day, four eights; on the twenty-first day, three eights; on the twenty-second day, two eights; on the twenty-third day, one eight. Within this ten-day period, a single rain is permissible. This is the movement of Heaven and Earth, husband and wife, yin and yang. The remaining seven and eight belong to *wu* and *ji*; they must not act recklessly but each guard their own bound qi, mutually containing and generating life. Choose the right moment—beware of transgression.\n\nThe master says: The eight trigrams and nine palaces, the moon’s six *jia* days, yin and yang in union, the six harmonies and eight births, the great measure of the eight winds, the twenty-four rains, the application of three and five, the calamities of seven and nine. When three and five are applied as the child, and seven and five as calamity, three before and two after, three—eight winds and eight qi in union. The Upper Prime is one, the Middle Prime is two, the Lower Prime is three; nine and one arise within them. The eight winds and twenty-four rains extend in one application. For ten days, only wind and qi descend. The embryo’s breath holds one thousand two hundred qi. On the sixteenth day, three qi descend like rain. The great measure of Heaven and Earth unites the three primes’ qi. On the twenty-fourth day, only wind and qi. *Jiazi* holds five qi, three and five; *jiashen*, six qi, three and five; *jiawu*, eight qi, three and five; *jiaxu*, six qi, three and five. *Guiyou* has abundant yin qi; *guimao*, abundant yang qi; *guisi*, abundant yin qi; *guihai*, abundant yang qi. *Jiachen* holds nine qi, three and five; *guichou*, abundant yang qi; *jiayin*, nine qi, three and five; *guiwei*, abundant yang qi.\n\n*Guiyou* and *guimao* are the great measure of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang in union. If one can clearly understand the six harmonies of yin and yang rotating in mutual pairing, avoid the taboos of three, five, and six harmonies, and seven, nine, and six harmonies. Left holds three qi, right holds six qi. Three, five, seven, and nine correspond with the twenty-four spirit-persons. The three and five proceed: left to the Upper Prime, right to the Mysterious Elder, center to the Supreme Great One. Calamities and illnesses hold one thousand two hundred qi; minor illnesses, two, five, seven, and nine. To nurture nature and preserve life, avoid celestial illnesses. The three and five are essential; five qi are most authentic. Seven and nine qi bring illness and calamity. Reflect thrice—do not transgress.\n\nThe master says: The eight trigrams and nine palaces, the moon’s six *jia* days, yin and yang in union, the six harmonies and eight births, the great measure of the eight winds and twenty-four rains, the application of three and five, the calamities of seven and nine. The five phases’ prohibitions for men and women. If one can apply them as the Mysterious Register, qi blends in primordial chaos, the yellow and white qi—capable of mutual destruction and mutual generation. Cultivate the body, contemplate goodness, and simply desire to live joyfully. In urgency, apply them. Fearing you may not understand, I set forth the method of the three descending qi, beginning from *renwu* and *guiwei*. In the first year of *Han’an*, on the tenth day of the first month at noon, the eight-scroll *Mysterious Register of Primordial Chaos* was revealed. It admonishes men and women not to recklessly apply talismans and contracts, dispelling old qi, corpse infestations, and ghosts. To speak of calamities and illnesses is to transcend the world—passing through with red qi, ascending at midday on *wu* and *ji*, clouds and dragons inverted and severed. Beyond rain, raise both hands above the head three times. Depart from the old Jade Chamber, return to the Eight Darknesses, untie the sixteen knots, and contemplate the eight qi to dissolve and generate qi. Qi is applied: the father generates the Supreme Mystery Palace, the mother generates the Supreme Subtlety Palace. The father is born on *bingyin*, the mother on *bingshen*. Before Heaven and Earth were established, the yellow and white were distinguished. Together, they apply the nine nines—eighty-one qi, each qi weighing two and a half taels. One on the left, the Upper Prime; one on the right, the Mysterious Elder; three in the center, the Supreme Great One—three nines, twenty-seven; nine nines, eighty-one.\n\nThus, men and women first two, then three—this is the three and five child. Together, reflect thrice on the central chapter of the abdomen and eyes. Three births and three risings become three births; three risings and three lyings become three deaths. One’s life depends on qi—do not transgress.\n\nThe master says: When the positions of three and five are established, the calamities of seven and nine are dispelled. First apply three and one; two, four, and nine generate qi. Qi, like three united, forms virtue—contemplate this, do not apply recklessly.\n\nThe Dao: From the first to the ninth day of the lunar month, contemplate the Primordial Qi of the Mysterious Origin in the head and eyes. The head holds the eight trigrams; the human body, the twenty-four spirits and the three, five, seven, and nine. Knowing this, the body may transcend.\n\nThe Dao: After the ten-day period of the lunar month, the numbers three, five, seven, and nine. From the tenth to the fifteenth day, proceed daily with three, five, seven, and nine. These are the six harmonies of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. The sun and moon must be clear—rain must not fall recklessly. Calamities may be averted; rain brings harm, withering roots and rotting seeds. Not understanding the methods of three and five, recklessly applying seven and nine—this is like a fish out of water, a person deprived of qi. Rain brings harm—be cautious, be cautious.\n\nThe Dao: From the sixteenth day of the lunar month, apply eight eights down to one eight. Within this ten-day period, a single rain is permissible. The waning moon belongs to *wu* and *ji*; seven and eight may bring wind but not rain. On the twenty-eighth day, it must cease. If one cannot apply three and five together but only proceeds with three, five, seven, and nine corresponding to the twenty-four spirits, not corresponding to the Upper Prime on the left, the Mysterious Elder on the right, and the Supreme Great One in the center—three and one are the correct qi of the Three Officials. The one before and two after are the Upper and Middle Primes. Lie back together, feet apart, inhaling and exhaling to the utmost limit of the primordial. Three completions transcend *wu* and *ji*. The infant’s embryo breath holds one thousand two hundred qi. If the body is afflicted by calamities and illnesses, they cannot be dispelled. Then contemplate the twenty-four spirits of the upper and lower cinnabar fields, and also contemplate them together with the three and five spirits. Men contemplate on the left, women on the right. Do not transmit recklessly—choose the right person. Be cautious, be cautious.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao aligns with the twelve months to harmonize the great measures of yin and yang, enacting the eightfold generative method by which the mysterious qi descends. The primordial qi ascends, and the spirit-qi of men and women each bears its name. These spirits may together traverse calamities and illnesses. Receive the four true characters, and the eight-character name aligned with qi. The Dao emerges from profound obscurity, enters into deep mystery. When the three and five qi rectify the body, one attains the divine immortality of emperors and kings in perfect peace—ten thousand times not one life is lost. Men possess three qi, women five qi; men possess twelve qi, women twelve qi. The twelve hours correspond to each, each firming their own spirits. The male spirit is Wang Wenqing, Zhou Zuosong; the female spirit is Wei Shangqing, Zhou Shigonglai. Thus the heart becomes luminous—do not transgress.\n\nThe Dao generates the six directions; when one wishes to pass through the five perils and traverse all calamities, dispelling epidemic qi and ceaseless oral afflictions, first contemplate the spirits of the *jiazi* lords. Follow the day to name its spirit; if the spirit is the peril, the Heavenly Bureau removes the Three Officials’ investigations. If one does not recite the spirit’s chapter and swear above, the years, months, and days will not resolve in their coming and going. The male official rides the sixty spirits; when the day of the yin spirit arrives, it may be summoned for service. When the day of the yang spirit arrives, it may also be summoned. The yang spirit resides five days in the yin household, the yin spirit five days in the yang household—thus the two mutually contain each other. Today is the *jiazi* day: contemplate the spirit to return the Six Rong and Ten Spirits to serve as messengers. Today is the *jiawu* day: contemplate the spirit to return the Nine Yi and Ten Spirits to serve as messengers. Thus the *zi* and *wu* generals govern the return of the six *gui* spirits. One who understands the six *gui* may traverse all affairs. Men and women each preserve their own spirits; qi must not be recklessly deployed. Within lies the undying Dao—let the emperor himself thrice reflect.\n\nThe Dao of the sun generates what is not yet manifest. First prepare the spirits of *jiazi*, then the twenty-four spirits. From the first day of the first month, follow the day’s name and title through the twelfth month—men’s and women’s spirit-qi share the same unity. Lose one, and life is incomplete. Thus establish the spirit’s position, following the month to enact it. Do not err or miscall others, lest they fail to serve in coming and going. When treating illness and epidemic qi, one should personally invoke the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, joining forces with the day’s spirit to assist. The Daoist Wang Jia enacts the three, five, seven, and nine. If you can receive my true words and essential teachings, you must share them with an enlightened master’s oral instructions, the upper and lower Nine Palaces, the trigrams, talismans, charts, registers, and scriptures. In the seventh month, seventh day, at noon of the Han An era’s first year, the Most High Lord Lao bestowed these upon Zhang Ling. The essential oral transmission grants long life, deliverance from the world, corpse liberation, and ascension to heaven in broad daylight. Descendants may traverse generations, passing through all calamities. In the second year, the year *guiwei*, on the seventh day of the first month at noon, Dao Ling transmitted these to Zhao Sheng, Wang Zhang, and Wang Ying, enacting the Yellow Writs, talismanic commands, Nine Palaces prohibitions, and the knowledge of male and female officials and spirits as treated in the eighth scroll. Essential teachings emerge from within. Sheng and the others transmitted these to the Three Ladies at the Northern Prosperity Abbey on Mount Zhuang, distinguishing the scrolls and contracts. First, the oral instructions of the Red Qi were bestowed: the proper enactment of the three, five, seven, and nine in the six directions of heaven and earth, with men and women each following their own spirits. Even the length of garments must be contemplated together, so each spirit guards its own. Heaven’s commands err in mutual confusion at human birth—first concentrate the spirit, as if contemplating the brain and marrow to complete the bones, firming the net of destiny. Untie the sixteen knots; the spirit’s hands pass over the head and stop. Do not transmit recklessly—be cautious, be cautious.\n\nThe master said: The Nine Yi of heaven and earth, the Eight Man, the Six Rong, the Five Di, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the Six Substances summoned for investigation, the Twenty-Four Lords of the Officials, the Heavenly Master, Female Master, and Lineage Master—Three Master Lords—the generals of the Three Heavens: the Great Red Heaven Unity, the Pure Tenuity Heaven Unity, and the Yu Yu Heaven Unity. One who understands the three qi and three-five may together traverse perils, escape the fate of years, and dispel epidemic illness. Essential teachings are transmitted orally, not in writing. According to the male official’s twenty-four qi and the female official’s twenty-four qi, the spirit registers and mysterious registers merge in the central chapter—do not transmit these without selecting the right person.\n\nOne who understands this nine-by-nine may dispel disasters and disperse misfortunes. Within lie the three microcosms of ingested substances. Without knowing the old reckoning of the three qi—*jiachen* and *guimao* begin this as true—*jiawu*, *yiwei*, and *bingshen* mark the sixty-year cycle. I fear you may drive away evil rebellions to no lasting effect. One may guard the One, not change thrice. The *jiawu* Dao issues forth (from itself). On the seventh day of the first month, at noon, it descends.\n\nBy birth year, receive the three qi, left and right. [Name] disperses the twenty-four spirit names and titles.
