Author unknown. Likely composed in the early Tang dynasty. One scroll. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Methods* section of the *Dongshen* Department.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Clarity Scripture’s Secret Formula for the True Elixir**\n\nOne yin, one yang—both substances are yellow.\nNot by pairing, yet they form a bridge.\nSinking in divine water, floating at the center,\nLayered like drops of blood, shimmering like scales.\nUsed, it becomes golden treasure; ingested, it extends life.\nTransforming and transmuting, it penetrates the ten directions.\nThis is the divine immortals’ method of elixir refinement, the art of earthbound transcendents.\nIts purpose is to relieve the destitute, extracting medicine for transmutation.\nYet those who obtain it in this age are bound by karma, seeking only profit,\nand thus fail to cultivate or consume it. Those who do acquire it\noften squander it on vanity, incurring divine retribution, their efforts in vain.\n\nTo refine this elixir, one must do so in a purified chamber\nor a secluded mountain valley, free of women, mourners, chickens, or dogs.\nFirst, burn incense and invoke the celestial powers,\nvowing sincerely and purifying the heart before proceeding.\nWithout such preparation, even if the elixir forms,\nit will be struck by thunder and lightning, wasting one’s efforts.\n\nThe transmission of this formula forbids transmutation for profit;\nit is solely for healing the afflictions of sentient beings.\nThose who refine and consume it according to the method may become earthbound transcendents,\nrelieving suffering. Alternatively, mix a portion of the elixir with alum for equal potency.\n\n**Methods for Treating All Illnesses**\nWherever disease arises, its efficacy is like ten thousand hands at work—its merit is self-evident.\nThis elixir bears ten names:\n\n1. **Dissolving Ice Pill** – Dissolves all cold stagnation, dispelling accumulated fluids.\n2. **Internal Cautery Pill** – Upon entering the abdomen, it burns away illness like fire.\n3. **Melting Snow Pill** – Like the sun melting ice or boiling water dissolving snow.\n4. **Tenfold Purgation Pill** – Expels malign substances upon ingestion.\n5. **Free Flow Pill** – Unblocks the five viscera, harmonizing the six bowels.\n6. **Qi-Regulating Pill** – Dissolves all qi stagnation.\n7. **Exorcising Evil Pill** – Expels demonic and ghostly influences without fail.\n8. **Stomach-Unblocking Pill** – Opens the stomach, restoring appetite.\n9. **Sweeping Illness Pill** – Sweeps away all diseases, leaving none uncured.\n10. **Ten Thousand Illness Pill** – Cures all ailments; upon entering the abdomen, it takes effect without exception.\n\nIt also bears seven names for specific syndromes:\n1. **Qi Syndrome**\n2. **Cold Syndrome**\n3. **Accumulation Syndrome**\n4. **Binding Syndrome**\n5. **Abscess Syndrome**\n6. **Mounting Syndrome**\n7. **Blood Syndrome**\n\nWhen these seven illnesses congeal—whether left or right—\nif left untreated, they fester into vacuous swelling, resembling a tortoise’s form, leading to death.\nAll beings in the world are composed of the four great elements,\nand the hundred diseases gather within. When heaven and earth fall out of harmony,\nobscurity and confusion arise, giving birth to illness and ultimately death.\nWhen water and fire are imbalanced, cold afflicts the heart;\nwhen food is not digested, death follows.\nWhen wind and rain are unregulated, the four limbs weaken and emaciate, leading to death.\n\nSome illnesses stem from past-life causes—\nblindness, deafness, sores, pox, foolishness, or incomplete limbs—\nall manner of evil obstructions, demonic influences, leprosy, misfortune, and calamities,\nall born of past misdeeds.\nYet those who consume this elixir with sincere intent will find all afflictions dispelled.\n\nFor chronic dysentery, inch-long worms, five types of hemorrhoids,\nuterine flooding, collapsing womb, nine kinds of wasting sores encircling the neck,\nnasal discharge of pus and blood, counterflow of the five viscera,\nswollen back qi, drum-like abdominal distension, chest and diaphragm fullness and pain,\ncarbuncles, leprosy, epidemic illnesses—\nall worldly diseases are remedied.\n\nThe elixir is formed into pills the size of sesame seeds.\nTake one on an empty stomach daily, gradually increasing to three.\nSwallow with tea; even the dead may be revived.\nTake one at sunrise and one before sleep.\nThose who consume it may walk five or ten *li* at night,\nand all beasts, venomous snakes, ghosts, and spirits will flee, daring not approach.\n\nAt first ingestion, the elixir purges the five viscera of malign substances, bringing immediate relief.\nOnly those destined by past lives will encounter this formula.\nWith prolonged consumption, one reverts from old age to youth, becoming an immortal forever.\nEven if one meets an untimely death, the body will remain intact in the earth, flesh and color unchanged,\nbecoming a corpse transcendent.\nOnly through cultivation and attainment of the Dao can this be known.\n\nThe achievements of those who consume the elixir and attain the Dao are too numerous to record.\nThe method of refinement is as follows:\n\nTake two *liang* of fine realgar from Wudu (Shen silver).\nTake two *liang* of orpiment from overseas.\nPlace these in a Hunanese lidded vessel, first lining it with ten sheets of gold leaf.\nCombine the realgar and orpiment, grinding them to powder in a mortar before placing them in the vessel.\nPack tightly, then seal with the lid, securing the edges with salt-clay as prescribed.\n\nNext, take a porcelain crucible large enough to hold one *dou* or more.\nFirst, layer three to five *jin* of lead oxide, packing it firmly to a thickness of five *cun*.\nPlace the vessel at the center, then lightly pack more lead oxide around it until the crucible is full,\nregardless of quantity. Seal the crucible with Six-One Clay to a thickness of two to three *fen*,\nthen place it in a basin filled with ash, allowing it to dry in the shade.\nEnsure the clay seals the crucible completely, top and bottom, before firing.\n\nOn the first day, use half a *jin* of mature fire, surrounding the vessel on all sides without interruption, day and night. By the fifth day, add another half *jin* of fire. Every three days, increase the fire by half a *jin*, until it reaches five *jin*. The clay encasing the crucible and furnace need only retain the fire’s heat—no other method is required. Nurture it thus for forty-five days. Then add three *jin* of mature fire and continue for forty-nine days before stopping. Wait until the fire cools, then remove the vessel and open it. Inside, the elixir will appear vermilion-red or golden-yellow. When most of the lead oxide has turned the color of purple gold, collect it. It governs all malignant sores.\n\nTake one *fen* of the elixir from the vessel and combine it with one *liang* of mercury. On a fire, grind them slowly in a mortar until they gradually form cinnabar sand. Pierce the elixir vessel with an iron cross. Seal it again with Six-One Clay and wait for it to dry. Then place it in a water-and-fire furnace for nurturing.\n\nThe water-and-fire furnace is made as follows: take an earthenware rice steamer, plaster its sides with clay, leaving only a hole at the center of the base. Place the elixir vessel over this hole, allowing it to protrude about half a *cun* above the steamer’s bottom. Beneath the steamer, keep a bowl of water, positioned so the water’s surface is half a *cun* from the vessel’s base—just close enough to avoid wetting it. Begin with three *liang* of fire, gradually increasing to half a *jin* after half a day. Each time, add one *liang* more. After seven days, when the fire has cooled, open it to find the elixir fully subdued. Seal it again as before and nurture it for another seven days. Then take a small portion, test it in fire, and it will turn to gold—though it may retain the color of licorice. Add another *liang* of mercury, grind it into cinnabar sand as before, and nurture it in the water-and-fire furnace. Open it every seven days to add another *liang* of mercury, continuing until one *jin* is reached.\n\nIf you wish to refine it into treasure, remove half; if not, continue nurturing it, occasionally adding two *liang* of sulfur, ground and placed in the furnace, where it will turn vermilion. Take one *fen* of the previously refined golden elixir, combine it with half a *jin* of mercury and three *liang* of sulfur, grind them into cinnabar sand, seal with Six-One Clay as before, and gently heat it in the water-and-fire furnace. After seven days, open it and add another *liang* of mercury and one *fen* of sulfur. Seal and nurture it as before, adding up to one *jin*. After half a year, add another *jin* of mercury and four *liang* of sulfur, nurturing it according to the previous method. If you wish to refine it into treasure, remove it; if not, continue nurturing it as before.\n\nAnother method: if you seek the true primordial elixir, take a portion of the initial elixir and nurture it. After three years, a grain the size of a millet seed can transmute one *liang*. After four years, one grain can transmute two *liang*. After five years, one grain can transmute three *liang*. After nine years, one grain can transmute one *jin*. This elixir is originally a great Daoist method of immortality, later adapted to save the world. First, transmute the elixir, nurture it for three years, and it can be ingested to cure illnesses.\n\nThe method of ingestion: grind the elixir finely, levigate it with water until it is as fine as powder, and place it in a porcelain bottle. Suspend the bottle in a well for seven days, then remove it. Boil it in licorice water for thirty to fifty cycles, then dry it. Mix it with jujube pulp to form pills the size of hemp seeds. Place one pill in a *jin* of meat, and in the sixth month, the meat will not spoil even after a month—proof of its divine efficacy.\n\nWhen taking the elixir, first bathe and don fresh, clean clothes. Eat only plain foods for seven days, avoiding all impure and foul substances. Each day on an empty stomach, take three pills with pure water or wine. When replenishing the elixir, if there are those who are poor, use the elixir to trade for goods to aid them, but never reveal it lightly. Only those with karmic affinity to the Dao may obtain this method. If carelessly transmitted, misfortune will extend to later generations—guard it closely. If a Daoist obtains it, they must retreat to the mountains and valleys to cultivate in seclusion, preserving and guarding it.\n\nIf the yin and yang components are not authentic, even a fine elixir may fail to form, or its power may be weak. The best material is deep-pool silver. For sealing the vessel, take white ash from charcoal, mix it half-and-half with *ling* clay, and use it to seal. For sealing the crucible, mix sand, charcoal powder, yellow earth, paper fibers, and old straw sandals as reinforcement, then knead it into clay and seal according to the method.\n\nHere ends the *Shangqing Scripture’s Secret Formula for the True Elixir*.",
