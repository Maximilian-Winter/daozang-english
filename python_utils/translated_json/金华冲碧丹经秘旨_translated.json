  "full_translation": "**Gold and Jade Elixir of Jin Hua: Secret Essentials**\n\n**Title:** *The Secret Essentials of the Gold and Jade Elixir of Jin Hua*\nCompiled by Meng Jian of the Southern Song. Two volumes.\nSource: *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Dongshen* (Cavernous Gods) Section, *Zhongshu* (Miscellaneous Arts) Category.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: The Sea of Jade Elixir Secret Essentials**\nTransmitted by the Sea-Qing Old Man Bai Yu’an\nReceived by Peng Zu, the Crane-Lin Hermit of the Three Mountains\n\n**Ingredients:**\nTen *liang* of pure lead, two *liang* of refined sulfur—ground together, then roasted with sand and ground again into powder. Refine with water and fire in a sealed crucible to form the elixir embryo (*dan pei*) for internal alchemy.\n\nTwo *jin* of mountain and marsh herbs, combined with two *jin* of high-quality black lead, gradually added to an ash pit for decoction until fully reduced, then pounded into fine beads.\n\n**Divine Chamber Method:**\nEight *liang* of true gold, cast into a *Hun Dun* primordial embryo—one piece, shaped like an egg or a sphere, either form acceptable.\n\nAdditionally, one *liang* of true gold, hammered into a hollow tube (*gānzi*), its center the size of a coin’s hole, extending beyond the embryo by half an inch at each end. The tube must fit the embryo snugly—neither too wide nor too narrow.\n\nOnce the embryo is inserted and sealed, wrap the gold in red stone pitch (*chi shi zhi*), seal the seams with vinegar, and let dry.\n\nEight *liang* of white gold hammered into a water-sea base, embedded into the crucible’s mouth for two inches. The base aligns with the top, forming a sealed chamber, with the hollow gold tube inserted through the bottom to connect with the central chamber. Seal the mouth with pitch-clay, let dry, then introduce water.\n\n**External Crucible:**\nMade of ceramic, large enough to contain the divine chamber and two *jin* of white gold—neither too wide nor too narrow. If the interior is too spacious, line it with vinegar-mixed yellow clay and let dry.\n\nNext, place half a handful of white gold at the base, level it, then position the gold crucible. Add more white gold, spreading it evenly to cover. Use a sheet of paper as a ring to secure the gold crucible in place, then fill the gaps with coarse white gold. Insert the silver water-sea, press the ring into place, and shake to compact. Seal tightly and suspend within the elixir furnace.\n\n**Water-Fire Correspondence and Timing:**\nEight *liang* of water, half a *jin* of fire—adjust according to the *zi-wu* (child-midday) cycle or *mao-you* (morning-evening) shifts. After half a month, open the crucible and examine the embryo. If it glows emerald-green and luminous, it is perfected.\n\nIf it remains purple or red, continue refining with fire for seven days until it achieves the emerald-green radiance. This surpasses the exchange of *qi*—it is the true seed.\n\nThe white gold remains untouched, its weight unchanged, even if slightly diminished—this is the attainment of true *qi*.\n\n**Further Water-Fire Soul-Stealing Method:**\nOne *jin* of silver, plunged into celestial-fallen water, quenched fifty times. In the water, mix three *liang* of the Three Yellows (*san huang*) into powder, absorbing the silver’s refined essence.\n\nUse paper to filter the water until clear, then pour into a gold basin and boil to nurture the embryo. After half a day, dry the residue, roast it, and avoid copper or iron vessels—this is the purification bath.\n\nNext, use a ceramic water-fire crucible, refining with alternating gentle and fierce flames until a liquid forms. Shape the residue into pea-sized pellets, wrap each in thick gold foil, and seal tightly.\n\nPlace two *jin* of white gold beads into the water-fire crucible, layering water above and below, and refine with circular *Kan-Li* (water-fire) movements for a month. The resulting powder is deep emerald-crimson, luminous like the moon—this is the *jin ye* (golden liquid), the essence of the Returning Elixir.\n\nThis is called *Lian Dan True Lead*.\n\n**Alternative Method:**\nFirst, boil the Three Yellows in water for a day, then remove them and pour in molten silver.\n\n---\n**Poetic Reflections:**\n\n**Mantra of the Full Court:**\n*\"Jade nectar, golden salve,\nReturning the embryonic essence—\nAll depends on *Kan-Li* alchemy.\nHeaven’s soul, Earth’s shadow,\nWithin the golden chamber, mutually refining—\nWith Central Yellow divine water,\nCyclically revolving,\nAll phenomena converge at the Pool of Flowers.*\n\n*Piercing Heaven, traversing Earth,\nFive *qi* harmonized at the foundation.\nThe Mystic Pass sealed shut,\nBoth orifices closed—\nWood and Metal intermingle,\nRefined into *Wu-Ji* (Five-Six),\nYielding the purple gold herb.*\n\n*Nine transformations congeal—\nPure and turbid mercury-lead,\nFollowing the twin waters’ celestial mechanism,\nThe elixir is born.\nLightly ascending with fire-powder,\nThe elixir’s gem radiates.\"*\n\n**Spring in the Secret Garden:**\n*\"To become a transcendent,\nRefine the golden liquid,\nSeven returns, nine restorations.\nYet marvel at the Female returning to the Male—\nThe Golden Sage resides in *Kan*.\nThe jade furnace blazes,\nThe golden crucible’s smoke chills.\nLead wraps silver,\nSand refines mercury.\nDivine fire questions the Pool of Flowers above and below—\nThe central chamber holds a single path,\nPiercing straight to the Celestial Pass.*\n\n*Dike the golden waters in cyclic exchange,\nOperate the yin-fire and yang-symbols—\nNot trivial.\nObserve the white snow illuminating Heaven,\nYellow buds covering Earth,\nTortoise and serpent entwined,\nBlack Hare and White Rabbit ascending.\nSince ancient times, *Kan* and *Li* in the mortal realm—\nNine transformations of simmering must expose deceit.\nThe omissions lie within humanity.\"*\n\n**Steamer Diagram:**\n*(Diagram omitted per instructions.)*\n\nThe **Steamer’s Construction and Refining Process**\n\nPlace a firepan below, its surface fully paved with flat bricks.\nCraft a steamer: fifteen *cun* high, twelve *cun* in diameter.\nWithin, mark the four cardinal gates—*zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*—\nand pierce five apertures at the rim to vent *qi*-fire.\nSeal the steamer’s mouth with a thick brick, carving a five-*cun* round hole.\nPlace a furnace frame atop, twelve *cun* wide, to secure the lid—\nfor the passage of water and fire.\nSuspend the elixir cauldron within.\n\n---\n**From the *Golden Flower’s Secret Essence of the Spitting Phoenix*—\nWhite Crane Grotto’s Nurturer of the Pure, Lan Yuanbai, transmitted to\nDisciple Xiyin Weng Chenyang Mengxu.\nThe Scripture states:\n\nThe *Taiji* is the root; the Five Phases, its function.\n*Kan* and *Li* are the tortoise and hare’s elixir chambers,\nwhile the two *qing* (passions) form the soul and spirit.\nThe Dragon and Tiger serve as the alchemical agents—\nuniting the Three Natures as husband and wife,\nbirthing the *Lao* infant, forming male and female.\nThe sixty-four hexagrams interweave as direct symbols,\nwith *Lún* and *Méng* marking rebirth.\nThe Three Talents harmonize; the Four Symbols are the furnace,\naligned with the Five Phases, completing at *Jìwèi*.\nWhen balanced, the Six Seasons interdepend;\nwhen opposing, the Nine Returns cycle.\nYin and yang adhere; water and fire interpose.\nWeighments must not falter; the foundation lies in myriad calculations,\nyet all converges in one substance.\nTransforming the myriad, it aligns with the Great Work—\nuniting with the ancestral Dao, the golden elixir and spirit丹 thus perfected.\n\nThe *Hua Chi* Secret Key states:\nWhen lead’s essence returns to mercury’s marrow, it is called *Hua Chi*.\nWhen mercury’s waters return to the Golden Pool, it is called *Shen Shui*.\nWhen the seven returns are complete and the nine restorations fulfilled,\nand the planetary cycles nurtured, the spirit embryo sheds—\nthis is the secret of the Immortals, the sacred texts of antiquity.\nLater scholars must not treat it lightly.\n\n---\n**Method of Refining Lead and Mercury**\n\nSelect bright vermilion cinnabar—ten *liang*, free of veining or impurities.\nAdd two *liang* of sulfur, grind to powder, and toast until they intermingle.\nSmelt in a water-fire cauldron, then regrind into eight *liang*.\n\nTake pure gold—eight *liang*—and cast into a *Hun Dun* \"Chaotic Egg\" cauldron.\nTake one *liang* of gold, forge into a *Shuiqingzi* (water-reed) tube—\nsealed at the base, four *cun* long—\nand insert into the *Hun Dun*, sealing the junction.\nSubmerge in eight *liang* of silver *Shuihai* (water-sea),\nthen seal the seams with pitch and alum, drying thoroughly.\nEnsure the water channel reaches the cauldron’s interior.\n\nNext, take pure mountain ores, refine into flower-silver—two *jin*—\nand mold into beads. Spread over the gold *Hun Dun*’s exterior,\nthen reseal the seams. Secure the vessel in a crucible,\nensuring no gaps remain. Place the silver *Shuihai* beneath,\nsealing the entire structure with thick, dense clay.\nAfter half a day of drying, place within the *Dan’ao* (elixir furnace),\nigniting fires at the base and sides—five *jin* of raw charcoal—\nuntil half the substance is consumed.\nAdd three *jin* of charcoal for two or three further firings.\nAfter a day and night, the elixir’s *qi* will have passed through.\n\nAncient methods dictate three *jin* of charcoal—one and a half *jin* at *mao* and *you*—\nwithout smothering the flames. Seven days are the limit,\nlest the *qi* be insufficient—hence the name *Duànhún* (Severing Soul) Fire.\nThe silver requires no further water; only warm broths may be added,\nnever left parched.\n\n---\n**Severing Soul Method**\n\nRemove the eight *liang* of elixir seed, grind finely,\nand bathe in *Hua Chi* water, boiling briefly before drying.\nReturn to the gold cauldron, spreading as before,\nresealing as prior. Boil until a paste forms.\nWrap thickly in gold foil, then take one *jin* of silver,\nrefined into flower-silver, ground to powder.\nSpread the beads, place in the crucible,\nand submerge in eight *liang* of silver *Shuihai*,\nwith three *Shuiqingzi* tubes inserted to the base.\nSeal with pitch and alum, drying thoroughly.\nAdd warm broths frequently, then reseal the vessel.\nRehang in the *Dan’ao*, igniting two *jin* of charcoal.\nRotate the fires in three cycles, nurturing for seven days.\nOnly then does the elixir seed awaken—\nnow called *True Lead*.\n\nThe silver is not reused.\nNext, suspend the vessel in an earthen pit,\nigniting three *jin* of charcoal. When removed,\nits hue is verdant green—*True Death* has been attained.\n\n---\n**Crucible Diagram**\n**Lead and Mercury Returning to the Unfinished Diagram**\n\nTake ten *liang* of pure cinnabar, grinding to powder.\nUse only silver or gold ore; others are impure.\nTake eight *liang* of pure gold, two *liang* of lotus ash,\nand two *liang* of male and female substances (雄雌),\nground uniformly.\nFirst, melt the gold into a liquid, then add the ash and substances,\nstirring continuously until a yellow powder forms.\nWash with boiling water until fully purified, then dry.\n\nCombine with the cinnabar powder, mixing thoroughly.\nPlace in a small, sealed stone pomegranate jar—\nnine-tenths full—then seal with rice husk ash,\npiercing with copper coins and binding with silk in a cross.\nInvert into a wide-mouthed, deep water jar,\naligning the mouths and securing them.\nSuspend in the *Dan’ao*, igniting one *jin* of charcoal above,\ntwo *liang* within the furnace.\nRepeat three times, then ignite three *jin* above,\nallowing the lead and mercury to fully transmute.\nThe water below collects as *Hua Chi* water.\nBoil and dry the gold, stirring once per cycle.\nRepeat with ten *liang* of cinnabar and mercury,\nthen combine with the gold and dry the mercury—\nawaiting the *True Lead* seed for elixir fusion.\n\n---\n**Method of Mating the Embryo with Mercury**\n\n**Method of Mating the Embryo with Mercury**\n\nFor each *True Lead* seed of eight *liang* as powder,\ntake eight *liang* of purified *True Mercury*,\nand place them together in a **mortar** (*rǔbēi*)\nwhile seated upon a **steaming vessel** (*tāngguàn*) of boiling water,\nsettling firmly.\nThe two substances—*True Lead* and *True Mercury*—\nmust be repeatedly ground with force until finely pulverized.\n\nDrip a few drops of *Hua Chi* water\ninto the white powder daily,\none day as the measure,\nthis called **Embryo Formation** (*jié tāi*).\n\nTest with fire—if it does not move,\nplace it into a **inverted crescent-moon furnace** (*yǎn yuè fǎ xiàng dǐng*)\nand apply **water-fire** (*yǔnhuǒ*) for half a month.\n\nIncrease the grinding as before,\nadding purified *True Mercury* until reaching three *jin* of mercury.\n\nAfterward, take only *Red Mercury* (*Zhū Gōng*),\nboiled with *Hua Chi* water,\nand add it in.\n\nLater, when the process is prolonged,\nit is unnecessary to boil the mercury—\nit will naturally become true.\n\n**First Phase of Great Return: Refining the Yellow Embryo and Furnace**\nThe sequence is: four *liang*, five *liang*,\nsix *liang*, seven *liang* and a half,\nnine *liang* and a half—\ntotaling three *jin*.\n\nTake eight *liang* of **refined gold** (*Zhú sè zhēnjīn*),\ncondense into a liquid,\nand add two *liang* of **clear sulfur** (*Míng liú*),\nhalf *liang* of **male sulfur** (*xióng*),\nand half *liang* of **female sulfur** (*cí*).\nStir-fry into a powder,\nthen refine in the **water-fire furnace** (*shuǐhuǒ dǐngzào*)\nuntil uniformly colored.\nShape into a **hollow, double-layered basin** (*jiākōng xīn wǎnzi*)\nlike the form of an **inverted moon** (*yǎngyuè*).\n\nWithin the basin’s hollow center,\nleave an opening of about one *cùn*,\nensuring the layers do not touch.\n\nPierce the upper basin’s center,\nand insert a **goldwater tube** (*jīnshuǐ wànzi*).\nPlace it upright,\nthen immerse into eight *liang* of **silverwater sea** (*yínshuǐ hǎi*).\n\nAgain, use **ash-glauberite** (*zhīfàn*)\nto seal it dry,\nthen immerse directly into the **inverted moon** (*yǎn yuè*).\nReturn the previously processed *True Lead* and *True Mercury* of one *jin*\ninto the **inverted moon furnace** (*yǎn yuè lú*).\n\nOutside, use a **fixed outer vessel** (*wǎnguàn*) of one *jin*,\nseal the mouth with **outer fixed cement** (*wàigù kǒufèng*),\nand bind with iron wire.\nSuspend it into the **elixir furnace** (*dāntāng*).\nApply fire on all four sides,\nand at the base,\nfrom eight *liang* to one *jin*.\nAdjust the fire at **cox** (*mǎo*) and **yáng** (*yǒu*) times,\nthen reduce after half a month,\nmaintaining five *liang* of fire for three days.\nOpen and close the furnace three times—\nthe *True Lead* and *True Mercury* will truly transmute.\n\nRemove it,\nthen boil again with *Hua Chi* water.\nRefine in the **water-fire furnace** once more,\nforming a liquid,\nand repeat as the **husband**.\n\nAgain, take five *liang* of purified *True Mercury*,\nand grind as initially upon boiling water.\nPlace it back into the **inverted moon furnace** (*yǎn yuè lú dǐng*),\napplying **water-fire** (*yǔnhuǒ*) for half a month,\nuntil completion.\nBoil it again as before,\npouring the liquid repeatedly.\nAdd until three *jin* of mercury are refined—\nall will become the **precious treasure**.\n\nIf the **Yellow Embryo** (*Huáng Yá*)\nhas not yet been subdued by fire,\ncontinue applying **water-fire** (*yǔnhuǒ*)\nuntil it is fully refined.\nNurture until it reaches a **golden-yellow soil color** (*Huángtǔ sè jīnróng*),\nthe true **steel meridian** (*Zhēn xī*).\n\n**Great Return Phase Begins Here—**\ntake much of the **Yellow Embryo** (*Huáng Yá*),\nreplacing the **inverted moon furnace’s** (*yǎn yuè*) **basin** (*hézi*).\n\nThis method should be kept secret.\n\n---\n\n**Second Phase of Great Return: Refining the Primordial Spirit (Mixed-Essence) Godlike Elixir and Furnace**\n\nTake ten *liang* of **cinnabar** (*Chénshā*),\nfive *liang* of **male and female sulfur** (*xióngcí yīng*),\nand one *liang* of **clear sulfur** (*Míng liú*),\nas powder.\nRefine in the **water-fire furnace** (*shuǐhuǒ dǐng*) until forming **six elixirs** (*liùzǐ*).\nMeasure about one *jin* of **elixir residue** (*liùzǐ*).\n\nFirst, boil with *Hua Chi* water for one day.\nNext, use ten *liang* of **refined gold** (*Zhú sè huángjīn*)\nto shape a **basin** (*bǎnhézi*),\ncontaining the previous **fifty *liang* of elixir embryo** (*dāngāo*).\nWithin, place one *jin* of **cinnabar elixir residue** (*Zhū Dān liùzǐ*).\nOutside, use **golden-yellow soil** (*Huángtǔ*)\nto seal the basin,\nand embed it into the **golden basin** (*jīnhézi*).\n\nNext, use six *liang* of gold\nto craft a **water ring** (*shuǐhuán*),\nor use the **Yellow Embryo** material for this as well.\nMeasure the **height of the cinnabar elixir residue** (*liùzǐ*)\nand the **depth of the basin** (*hézi*)\nto determine the size of the **water ring**.\n\nArrange the **elixir embryo** (*yázi*)\nabove and below,\ncovering the **water ring**’s surface evenly.\nInsert a **silverwater tube** (*yínshuǐ wǎn*)\ninto the center,\nreaching the **ash layer** (*huīzhōng*).\nPierce through the **basin’s surface** (*hé gài zhī miàn*),\nand place a **water bucket** (*shuǐdǒu*) above.\nSeal the mouth with **ash-glauberite** (*zhīfàn*)\nuntil it is dry,\nensuring no leakage of water.\n\nOnce fully sealed and dry,\nsuspend it into the **elixir furnace** (*dāntāng*).\nApply fire above at eight *liang* for five days.\nApply fire below at five *liang* for five days.\nIncrease fire above to ten *liang* for five days.\nReduce fire below to eight *liang* for five days.\nIncrease fire above to twelve *liang* for five days.\nReduce fire below to ten *liang* for five days.\n\nRemove it—\nthe elixir will be **water-worn** (*shuǐhào*).\nAdd **boiling water** (*tāng*)\nfrequently without letting it dry out.\nFor every **two *qiǎn* and a half** (*liǎng*),\nboil five *liang* of mercury refined with *Hua Chi* water,\nuntil it becomes **superior yellow gold** (*shàng sè huángjīn*).\n\nAn alternative method:\nAfter equalizing the fire above and below,\nremove it into a **ground pit** (*dìkēng*).\nApply fire at ten *jin* in one **burning cycle** (*yīhuǐ*),\nallowing the fire to naturally consume itself.\nFrequently add **warm water** (*wēntāng*),\nand take the elixir as before.\nUse this for two months,\nwith fire adjustments the same.\n\n---\n\n**Third Phase of Great Return: Refining the Elixir that Pierces Heaven and Earth and Its Furnace**\n\nTake the previous **eight *liang* of cinnabar elixir** (*Zhū Dān*),\nadd eight *liang* of **sulfur-refined stone cinnabar** (*liú shéng guò shídānshā*),\nand half *liang* of **male sulfur** (*xióng yīng*),\ngrinding them evenly together.\n\nUse ten *liang* of **mercury-gold** (*Gōngjīn*)\nto form a **double-layered well ring** (*jiājǐng kuàng*),\nwith four sides and a base,\nhollow like a well,\nand a single hole at the top.\nInsert a **goldwater tube** (*jīnshuǐ wàn*)\ninto the well,\nreaching the **water sea** (*shuǐ hǎi*).\n\nWithin the **water sea**,\nalso use a **hollow water tube** (*xūshuǐ zān*),\npiercing into the **central well** (*zhōnggōng jǐng*)\nuntil it reaches the **basin’s bottom** (*hé dǐ*).\n\nThe **golden basin** (*jīnhé*)\nis five *cùn* high,\nwith a diameter of four *cùn*,\nand must be **wide** (*kuàngrù*).\nThe **well** (*jǐng*) is four *cùn* high,\nwith a diameter of three *cùn*,\nand use **golden-yellow soil** (*Huángtǔ*)\nand **Yellow Embryo** (*Huáng Yá*) powder\nto cover the well’s interior.\n\nOne *jin* of **cinnabar elixir** (*Zhū Dān*)\nis pounded into pieces the size of **chessmen** (*qízǐ*).\n\nOutside, use a **furnace vessel** (*wèng dǐng qì*)\nof ten *liang* of gold,\nor craft an **outer furnace** (*wàidǐng*) from **golden-yellow soil** (*Huángtǔ*).\n\nEmbed the **golden basin** (*jīnhé*) into the hollow space,\nfilling it with one *jin* of **golden-yellow soil** (*Huángtǔ*) and **Yellow Embryo** (*Huáng Yá*) powder.\nSeal below with two **silverwater tubes** (*yínshuǐ wǎn*),\nthen tightly seal and suspend into the **elixir furnace** (*dāntāng*).\n\nApply **three-directional fire** (*sānfāng huǒ*),\nshifting between **cox** (*mǎo*) and **yáng** (*yǒu*) times,\neach at eight *liang*,\nuntil reaching ten *liang*,\nthen increase to one *jin* as the final measure.\nCease the fire.\n\nApply this **water-fire** (*yǔnhuǒ*) process\nfor three months,\nwith daily adjustments,\nadding ten *jin* of fire twice.\n\nIn the **ground pit** (*dìkēng*),\napply fire on all four sides\nand at the base,\nuntil it glows **deep red** (*tōnghóng*).\nFrequently add **boiling water** (*tāng*),\n\nRemove the furnace’s **Jūdān** in cold,\nweighing half a *liang*—**dry mercury** (*gāngóng*) five *jin*—\nboth refined as **purple powder** (*zǐmó*).\n\nAgain use **Three Yellows** and **silverwater** (*yínshuǐ*),\nboiling the mercury to form its essence.\n\n**Fourth Return of the Elixir: Three Talents Transformation Elixir and Furnace Diagram**\nTo the right: **Third Return’s Vermilion Male Elixir** (*Jūxióng Dān*), one *jin*,\nground into a paste.\n\nTake **vermilion-mercury** (*zhūgōng*) four *jin*,\nadd **Male Essence** (*Xióngyīng*) four *liang*,\ngrind uniformly, then refine with gentle fire\nuntil it turns **purple**—**dead mercury** (*sǐgōng*).\n\nNow cast **three *jin* of golden sand and Yellow Embryo** (*Huáng Yá*)\ninto a furnace (*dǐng*), one *shì* two *cùn* high,\nfour *cùn* in diameter.\nInside, place **ten *liang* of mercury-gold** (*jīngōng*)\nin two rings.\n\nThe **water pool** (*shuǐchí*) uses five *liang*,\nwith matching dimensions.\nThe lower ring is one *cùn* two *fēn* high,\nthree *cùn* five *fēn* in diameter,\nflat-bottomed with no holes,\nbut a central aperture at the top\nwhere a **golden water tube** (*jīnshuǐwǎn*) is inserted and sealed.\nThe tube extends five or six *cùn* downward.\n\nThe upper ring’s aperture aligns with the lower ring’s top.\nIts central hole connects to the **silverwater basin** (*yínshuǐhǎi*)\nvia a water tube, sealing the base.\nWater flows into the lower ring’s bottom\nwithout leaking outward.\nThe upper ring sits one *cùn* five *fēn* above the basin.\n\nBetween the two rings, place the **five *jin* of prior elixir**,\nthen wrap the **golden furnace** (*Yá Dǐng*) in **silver foil**,\nand finally encase it in **Yellow Embryo clay** (*Huáng Yá* method),\nthickening to two *zhǐ* for firmness.\n\nA **one-*jin* silverwater basin** is shaped deep and wide,\nembedded around the furnace’s mouth,\nsecured with iron wire,\nand suspended in the **elixir furnace** (*Dāntāng*).\nFire is applied on all sides—**three *jin* total**—\nwith **cox** (*mǎo*) and **yǒu** (*yǒu*) adjustments.\nRefine thus for three months.\n\nRemove and hang in the **ground pit** (*dìkēng*),\napplying **thirty *jin* of fire** in three stages,\nletting it consume freely,\nwhile frequently replenishing with **boiling water** (*tāng*).\n\nWhen cold, the elixir glows like **vermilion tangerine**,\nits **purple powder** (*zǐmó*) luminous and gathered—\nmix with **five *liang* of mercury**,\nforming the **Great Medicine** (*Dàyào*), radiant as **purple gold**.\n\n**Method for Ingesting the Elixir:**\nIn seclusion, draw water from a quiet well,\nseal the elixir in a **golden basin** (*jīnhé*),\nwrap in cotton, and suspend it in the well for three months.\nSteam in **mung bean broth** for five days and nights,\nthen boil in **licorice decoction** for one day,\nand refine for three days and nights into **light, fine powder** (*qīngchén*).\n\nRoll into pills with **reed rhizome jelly** (*Huángjīng gāozi*),\nthree hundred sixty pills per *liang*.\nMorning and evening, swallow one pill\nwith fresh-drawn well water or **ginseng decoction**.\nAvoid **five pungent spices**, **mutton blood**, and impure substances.\nDo not reveal this to others.\n\nAfter completion, one’s vision spans ten thousand *lǐ*,\nhearing reaches the **Nine Heavens** (*Jiǔxiāo*),\nthe body grows light, youth preserved—\nthus attaining **Earthly Immortality** (*Dìxiān*).\n\n**Fifth Return of the Elixir: Three Pure Supreme Treasure Elixir and Furnace Diagram**\nTake the **nine *jin* of dry mercury-gold** (*gāngóngjīn*)\nfrom the Fourth Return,\ncast into an **Outer Divine Chamber Furnace** (*Shénshì Wàidǐng*), one *shì* five *cùn* high,\nfive *cùn* in diameter.\n\nCast a **water basin** (*shuǐhǎi*) atop, one *jin* in weight,\nalso of mercury-gold, five *cùn* deep,\nmatching the furnace’s width,\nand embed it.\n\nFashion an **Inner Divine Chamber** (*Shénshì Nèishì*)\nfrom **golden sand and Yellow Embryo**,\nshaped like an egg, with three legs,\neach one *cùn* five *fēn* high.\nThe chamber is nine *cùn* tall,\nthree *cùn* five *fēn* wide.\n\nReplicate the **water conduction method** (*tōngshuǐ fǎ*)\nto form the **Yellow Embryo** (*Huáng Yá*), three *jin* in weight,\nand refine this chamber.\n\nThe chamber’s top has a hollow lid\nwith a water tube piercing through.\n\nThe **Divine Chamber** holds up to five *jin* of medicine.\nThe **elixir** uses **five *jin* of True Mercury** (*Chén Gōng*),\nfirst mixed with **Male Essence** (*Xióngyīng*) eight *liang*,\n**sulfur** (*liúhuáng*) eight *liang*,\nand refined uniformly.\nBoil with **Divine Water** (*Shén Shuǐ*) half a day,\ndry, and pound into **six blocks** (*lùkuài*) in a **water-fire furnace** (*shuǐhuǒ dǐng*).\nCrush into powder.\n\nFill the **Yellow Embryo Divine Chamber** with the elixir,\ninsert the water tube, and seal with the **hollow water lid**.\nThe lid’s tube connects to the **golden water basin**,\nall sealed with **fat alum** (*zhīfàn*).\nFill with **most refined clear water** (*ruìqīngshuǐ*) in the basin.\n\nEncase the **Outer Furnace** in **Six-to-One clay** (*liùyī ní*),\nthickening to two *zhǐ* around its entire body,\nsecure with iron wire,\nand suspend in the **elixir furnace**.\n\nOpen the **three directional gates** (*sānfāng mén*)—**Leac, Midday, and Dog** (*yínwǔxū*)—\napplying fire according to time and direction:\nthree *jin* per direction, two gates for exhausting *qi*.\nApply fire three times daily, replenishing three *jin* each,\nshifting through **Leac, Midday, and Dog** for sixty days.\n\nRemove and hang in the **ground pit**,\nsitting on ashes, with **forty-five *jin* of fire** in three stages,\nletting it consume freely,\nwhile frequently adding **warm water** (*wēntāng*).\n\nWhen cold, the elixir shimmers with **purple cloud radiance** (*zǐxiá guāngsè*),\nits divine luster like the **sun and moon**.\nEach **character-point** (*yīzì diǎn*) yields five *liang* of **purple gold**—\none *zì* thus produces five *liang* of **Upper World Celestial Treasure** (*Shàngshì Tiānbǎo*).\nIt can further transmute **five *liang* of silver** into gold.\n\nAbove the **Inner Chamber**, a **purple powder fine dust** (*zǐfěn qīngchén*)\nsettles on the lid—collect this in a **golden basin**,\nfor it is the **body of the Great Elixir** (*Dà Dān zhītǐ*).\nDo not use lightly; reserve for the **Nine Returns Elixir** (*Jiǔzhuàn Huándān*).\n\n**Sixth Return of the Elixir: Yin-Yang Harmony Elixir and Furnace Diagram**\nTake the **nine *jin* of condensed, water-fire-refined essence** from the Fifth Return,\ncast into an **Outer Furnace** one *shì* two *cùn* high—\nas before—four *cùn* in diameter.\n\nWrap the furnace in **golden foil** (*jīnpí*) as an outer lining.\n\nNext, cast **two *jin* of dry mercury-purple gold** (*gāngóng zǐjīn*)\ninto a **Divine Chamber** (*Shénshì*), egg-shaped,\nseven *cùn* tall, three *cùn* five *fēn* wide.\n\nInside, place the **accumulated fine dust** (*jīxià qīngchén*) eight *liang*,\nmixed with **refined vermilion-mercury** (*bīguò zhūgōng*) one *jin*,\nand **flying Male Essence** (*fēiyīng*) four *liang*,\nground until no stars remain—\nthen place it into the **Divine Chamber** and seal.\n\n**Sixth Return: Yin-Yang Harmony Elixir and Furnace Diagram (continued)**\n\nSeal the **Divine Chamber** with **golden sand and sulfur powder**, filling it level and smooth. At its base, forge a **golden disk** eight *liang* in weight, three *cùn* five *fēn* in diameter, and place it within the **Divine Chamber’s foundation**, rising three *cùn* five *fēn* high. On either side, drill holes to insert **golden water tubes** (*jīnshuǐguàn*) up to the **Divine Chamber’s** apex, sealing the surface as one. These tubes connect directly to the **golden water sea** beneath, which holds one *jin* of gold. The tubes encase the **Divine Chamber**, then fill the exterior with **golden sand and sulfur powder**, leveling it solid so no trace of the chamber remains visible.\n\nWrap the **Outer Furnace** in **refined yellow earth**, two *fēn* thick, and dry it thoroughly. Then place the **water sea** inside, reseal, and suspend it in the **Elixir Tortoise** (*Dānyuán*). Apply **water-fire talismans**, waiting two months. At the **coxial hours (coxial)** and **acid hours (acid)**, replenish the fire in three directions, three *jin* each, until the day’s quota is complete. Extract the elixir and place it in an earthen pit, applying fifty *jin* of fire in three stages, replenishing with warm water as the water evaporates.\n\nWhen the furnace cools, the **dry mercury** will have transformed into **purple-gold liquid snow**. For every ten *liang* of **dry mercury**, produce **celestial treasure of the highest antiquity**. Each *liang* of gold can transmute two or three *liang* of worldly silver into gold. Beneath the **water sea** and **Divine Chamber**, **purple qi-liquid snow** ascends—collect this in a **golden vessel**; it is the **Great Elixir**.\n\n---\n\n**Seventh Return: Five Peaks Communing with the Mysterious Elixir and Furnace Diagram**\nTake the **condensed essence** from the **Sixth Return’s Divine Chamber**, along with the **previously refined furnace essence**, and refine them together into a liquid with **purple divine radiance**.\n\nAdd **sulfur essence** (*huángyīng*) dropwise—nine *jin* to sixteen *jin*—to form the furnace. Pour this into an **earthen mold**, shaping it into the **highlands and lowlands of the Five Peaks**.\n\nBoil five *jin* of **refined cinnabar-mercury** in **divine water**, then pour it onto the **Elixir Foundation**, placing it within a **three-*jin* golden chaos vessel**. Cover with **powder from the Sixth Return’s elixir**, seal with **pharmaceutical clay**, embed in a **golden vessel**, and reseal. Apply **water above, fire below**, suspend in the **Elixir Tortoise**, and burn five *jin* of fire daily, allowing it to consume freely. When the water evaporates, replenish with warm broth. The next day, repeat with five *jin* of fire—neither increasing nor decreasing—until two months have passed.\n\nRemove the **golden yang cover**, replacing it with the **golden water sea** from within, sealing the seams and reinforcing the exterior with iron wire. Suspend it again in the **Elixir Furnace** for another month, burning one *jin* in each of the three directions, alternating at **coxial and acid hours**.\n\nWhen the day’s quota is complete, remove it and hang it in an earthen pit, immersing it in water above and below. Apply thirty *jin* of fire in one stage, then twenty *jin* in another, allowing the fire to consume freely. Upon removal, the **golden vessel** will contain **golden silkworms and jade shoots**, or forms resembling **lions, elephants, oxen, horses**, or **valiant generals**—each shaped by the **celestial influences of the day, hour, and star**, the **heroic qi of Heaven and Earth**, and the **refined essence of yin-yang**. For every ten *liang* of **dry mercury**, produce **celestial treasure of the highest antiquity**. Each *liang* of gold can transmute five *liang* of worldly silver into **great elixir gold**.\n\nBeneath the **water sea**, **five-colored auspicious clouds** ascend—this is the **light, refined essence of the elixir’s spiritual qi**, collected in the **golden chamber** and nurtured by **water-fire tempering**, awaiting use in the **Great Elixir**.\n\n---\n\n**Eighth Return: Supreme Ultimate Return Elixir and Furnace Diagram**\nTake five *jin* of **cinnabar-mercury**, add one *jin* of **flying sulfur essence** (*sānhuáng fēiyīng*), and refine it in a **water-fire furnace** into **elixir cinnabar**. Boil this in **divine water**, then grind it with five *jin* of **powder from the Seventh Return’s jade shoots and golden silkworms**.\n\nAdd five *jin* of **cinnabar elixir**. Then, take the **golden sand and sulfur essence elixir**—sixteen *jin*—from the **Seventh Return’s Divine Chamber**, and mix it evenly. Cast this in a **great fire** into a **furnace vessel** shaped like **Chaos**, two *shì* high, with a diameter of eight *cùn*.\n\nWrap the exterior with five *jin* of **pharmaceutical gold**, ensuring a tight seal. Forge an **empty golden sphere** eight *liang* in weight, three *cùn* in height and diameter, with two **water tubes** (*shuǐguàn*), two *liang* each, at either end. The tubes have a base below and an opening above, piercing through the **elixir furnace**. On the furnace’s surface, arrange **water buckets** to circulate warm water into the hollow space, filling the sides with the previous ten *jin* of medicine until half-full. Seal with a **medicine cover**, secure with iron wire, and wrap the exterior in **refined yellow earth**, two *fēn* thick, drying it thoroughly. Bind with iron wire and suspend it in the **Divine Tortoise**.\n\nFirst, apply one *jin* of **furnace fire**, alternating at **coxial and acid hours** for five days. Then, add ten *liang* of **base fire** for another five days. Return to one *jin* of **furnace fire** for five days, then add ten *liang* of **base fire** again for five days. Replenish evaporated water with warm broth, ensuring none spills outward—use the **water buckets** for this. Continue this cycle—one *jin* of **furnace fire**, ten *liang* of **base fire**—for three months. When complete, remove it to an earthen pit, apply fifty *jin* of fire in three stages, and replenish with warm water as the fire consumes.\n\nWhen the furnace cools, the elixir will be a **golden paste**, emitting a **purple radiance** that dazzles the eyes, with a taste **sweet as honey**. The **great medicine is now ripe**. One *liang* can transmute one *jin* of **dry mercury** into **purple great gold**. One *liang* of this elixir can also transmute ten *liang* of silver into **great elixir gold**, or ten *liang* of **dry mercury** into gold. Additionally, **flying golden frost-liquid snow** will appear—this is the **Great Return Elixir**.\n\n---\n\n**Ninth Return: Golden Liquid Great Return Elixir and Furnace Diagram**\nTake fifty *liang* of the **purple-gold elixir** from the previous return, casting it into a **Divine Chamber** seven *cùn* high, five *cùn* in diameter, with a sealed top. Wrap the exterior with twenty-four *jin* of **refined sulfur-gold essence**, forging a furnace one *shì* five *cùn* high, nine *cùn* in diameter.\n\nTake fifty *liang* of the **purple-gold elixir** from the inner furnace, casting it into five **pillars**—the central one four *cùn* low, two *cùn* half high—erected to support the **Divine Chamber**.\n\nNext, take one *jīn* of the **still elixir’s golden essence**, casting it into a **pointed-bottom water furnace** that can cover the golden furnace’s exterior. The pointed bottom must be straight and inserted into the **Chaos Chamber**, sealing it as in the initial stages of elixir refinement.\n\nThen, apply the **residue of the Eighth Return Elixir**—the **golden salve**—as a covering outside the **Chaos Chamber**. Within the **Chaos Chamber**, place one *jīn* of **large cinnabar blocks**, boiled in **Divine Water**. Afterward, use **long-stored cinnabar powder**, regardless of quantity, to spread and fill the chamber. Alternatively, mix dust with finely ground **cinnabar and mercury** to also produce the **Great Return Elixir**.\n\nOnce sealed, place the **Golden Furnace of Water Sea** beneath, inserting and tightly sealing the cracks. Secure the exterior with eighty-one *dǎi liǎng* of **yellow clay**, kneaded with **sal ammoniac, alum, paper fibers**, and other binding agents until firm. The outer furnace’s thickness should be one *zhǐ* half or two *zhǐ* wide. Bind it with sturdy iron wires and suspend it with iron chains inside a **three-tiered Law-Image Divine Furnace**, positioned before the altar. Maintain **incense and flame** day and night, set up a **leakage mechanism**, and regulate **water-fire cycles** according to the **Eight Trigrams and Sixteen Hexagrams**, opening and closing the **Eight Gates**, alternating **fire below and water above**, drawing, adding, and shifting them as needed. Afterward, follow the **weighted measures** to complete the **Great Heavenly Water-Fire Cycle** in one year.\n\nCover the **three-tiered furnace** with a protective enclosure, ensuring no one enters. The following year, remove the furnace from the underground pit, perform **ritual offerings and oaths to the Celestial Sovereign**, and avoid **Water Sea** contamination.\n\nThen, introduce **water into the furnace**, igniting **four surrounding fires** of thirty-six *liang* each for three cycles of ascent.\n\nThus, for nine days, when the final moment arrives, purify the ashes and place them in the **cold furnace** for three nights. The elixir obtained will be **radiant jade-like**, **purple-gold salve**, or **emerald elixir**, its brilliance surpassing the sun.\n\nDivide it into three portions: one to **offer to Heaven** for blessings, one to **save and aid the poor**, and one for **refining and liberating the spirits of the netherworlds**. Bury any remaining elixir, soak it in water for a hundred days to **steam out its poisons**, then roll it into pills—eighty-one grains per portion—using **yellow essence salve** for binding. Consume one portion annually.\n\nFinally, perform the **Grand Ritual Offering** to the **Three Realms of Deities**, swear oaths to the **Three Pure Ones of Heaven**, the **Three Officials and Nine Ministries**, the **ancestral masters of alchemical Daoists**, and the **local deities of the Nine Provinces**. This is done in anticipation of the **ascension**.\n\n**The Great Elixir’s Water-Fire Cycle**\nCommence the fire from **Winter Solstice** on the auspicious day of the **eleventh month**, increasing by one *liang* each day for thirty days until reaching the **ninth month**, then decrease it completely. Before **Established Winter** (立冬), cease the **water-fire cycles** for nine days.\n\nAt this time, select an **auspicious location and day**, establish the altar, and install the furnace. Choose a **south-facing site** with **scenic mountains and waters**, free from human activity, and avoid places with **carrion, graves, or foul qi** from poultry and feline beasts. Purify your mind with **fasting and abstinence**, shun worldly toil, and focus your heart and will on **tending the fire and observing the cycles**. Do not let your thoughts wander to **fame, profit, or sensual desires**. Ideally, three like-minded individuals should join in this endeavor.\n\n**Fire and Water Measures:**\n1st day: **one *liang* of fire**, fourteen *liang* of water.\n2nd day: **two *liang* of fire**, thirteen *liang* of water.\n3rd day: **three *liang* of fire**, twelve *liang* of water.\n4th day: **four *liang* of fire**, eleven *liang* of water.\n5th day: **five *liang* of fire**, ten *liang* of water.\n6th day: **six *liang* of fire**, nine *liang* of water.\n7th day: **seven *liang* of fire**, eight *liang* of water.\n8th day: **eight *liang* of fire** (on the **upper crescent**), seven *liang* of water.\n9th day: **nine *liang* of fire**, six *liang* of water.\n10th day: **ten *liang* of fire**, five *liang* of water.\n11th day: **eleven *liang* of fire**, four *liang* of water.\n12th day: **twelve *liang* of fire**, three *liang* of water.\n13th day: **thirteen *liang* of fire**, two *liang* of water.\n14th day: **fourteen *liang* of fire**, one *liang* of water.\n15th day: **fourteen *liang* of fire**, one *liang* of water.\n16th day: **fourteen *liang* of fire**, one *liang* of water.\n17th day: **thirteen *liang* of fire**, two *liang* of water.\n18th day: **twelve *liang* of fire**, three *liang* of water.\n19th day: **eleven *liang* of fire**, four *liang* of water.\n20th day: **ten *liang* of fire**, five *liang* of water.\n21st day: **nine *liang* of fire**, six *liang* of water.\n22nd day: **eight *liang* of fire**, seven *liang* of water.\n23rd day: **seven *liang* of fire**, eight *liang* of water.\n24th day: **six *liang* of fire**, nine *liang* of water.\n25th day: **five *liang* of fire**, ten *liang* of water.\n26th day: **four *liang* of fire**, eleven *liang* of water.\n27th day: **three *liang* of fire**, twelve *liang* of water.\n28th day: **two *liang* of fire**, thirteen *liang* of water.\n29th day: **one *liang* of fire**, fourteen *liang* of water.\n30th day: **one *liang* of fire** (on the **lower crescent**), fourteen *liang* of water.\n\nThese **fire-water cycles** are the sacred methods of the **Immortal Daoists**, not to be revealed to the vulgar.\n\nFor the **elixir of one *jīn*** (one *jīn* of medicine), **one *jīn* of fire** is required, and **three hundred eighty-four *chǐ*** (one *jīn*) of water is also needed.\n\nEach **yang line** of fire requires two *liang*, each **yin line** of water requires two *liang* and a half.

      "translated_text": "**Gold and Jade Elixir of Jin Hua: Secret Essentials**\n\n**Title:** *The Secret Essentials of the Gold and Jade Elixir of Jin Hua*\nCompiled by Meng Jian of the Southern Song. Two volumes.\nSource: *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Dongshen* (Cavernous Gods) Section, *Zhongshu* (Miscellaneous Arts) Category.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: The Sea of Jade Elixir Secret Essentials**\nTransmitted by the Sea-Qing Old Man Bai Yu’an\nReceived by Peng Zu, the Crane-Lin Hermit of the Three Mountains\n\n**Ingredients:**\nTen *liang* of pure lead, two *liang* of refined sulfur—ground together, then roasted with sand and ground again into powder. Refine with water and fire in a sealed crucible to form the elixir embryo (*dan pei*) for internal alchemy.\n\nTwo *jin* of mountain and marsh herbs, combined with two *jin* of high-quality black lead, gradually added to an ash pit for decoction until fully reduced, then pounded into fine beads.\n\n**Divine Chamber Method:**\nEight *liang* of true gold, cast into a *Hun Dun* primordial embryo—one piece, shaped like an egg or a sphere, either form acceptable.\n\nAdditionally, one *liang* of true gold, hammered into a hollow tube (*gānzi*), its center the size of a coin’s hole, extending beyond the embryo by half an inch at each end. The tube must fit the embryo snugly—neither too wide nor too narrow.\n\nOnce the embryo is inserted and sealed, wrap the gold in red stone pitch (*chi shi zhi*), seal the seams with vinegar, and let dry.\n\nEight *liang* of white gold hammered into a water-sea base, embedded into the crucible’s mouth for two inches. The base aligns with the top, forming a sealed chamber, with the hollow gold tube inserted through the bottom to connect with the central chamber. Seal the mouth with pitch-clay, let dry, then introduce water.\n\n**External Crucible:**\nMade of ceramic, large enough to contain the divine chamber and two *jin* of white gold—neither too wide nor too narrow. If the interior is too spacious, line it with vinegar-mixed yellow clay and let dry.\n\nNext, place half a handful of white gold at the base, level it, then position the gold crucible. Add more white gold, spreading it evenly to cover. Use a sheet of paper as a ring to secure the gold crucible in place, then fill the gaps with coarse white gold. Insert the silver water-sea, press the ring into place, and shake to compact. Seal tightly and suspend within the elixir furnace.\n\n**Water-Fire Correspondence and Timing:**\nEight *liang* of water, half a *jin* of fire—adjust according to the *zi-wu* (child-midday) cycle or *mao-you* (morning-evening) shifts. After half a month, open the crucible and examine the embryo. If it glows emerald-green and luminous, it is perfected.\n\nIf it remains purple or red, continue refining with fire for seven days until it achieves the emerald-green radiance. This surpasses the exchange of *qi*—it is the true seed.\n\nThe white gold remains untouched, its weight unchanged, even if slightly diminished—this is the attainment of true *qi*.\n\n**Further Water-Fire Soul-Stealing Method:**\nOne *jin* of silver, plunged into celestial-fallen water, quenched fifty times. In the water, mix three *liang* of the Three Yellows (*san huang*) into powder, absorbing the silver’s refined essence.\n\nUse paper to filter the water until clear, then pour into a gold basin and boil to nurture the embryo. After half a day, dry the residue, roast it, and avoid copper or iron vessels—this is the purification bath.\n\nNext, use a ceramic water-fire crucible, refining with alternating gentle and fierce flames until a liquid forms. Shape the residue into pea-sized pellets, wrap each in thick gold foil, and seal tightly.\n\nPlace two *jin* of white gold beads into the water-fire crucible, layering water above and below, and refine with circular *Kan-Li* (water-fire) movements for a month. The resulting powder is deep emerald-crimson, luminous like the moon—this is the *jin ye* (golden liquid), the essence of the Returning Elixir.\n\nThis is called *Lian Dan True Lead*.\n\n**Alternative Method:**\nFirst, boil the Three Yellows in water for a day, then remove them and pour in molten silver.\n\n---\n**Poetic Reflections:**\n\n**Mantra of the Full Court:**\n*\"Jade nectar, golden salve,\nReturning the embryonic essence—\nAll depends on *Kan-Li* alchemy.\nHeaven’s soul, Earth’s shadow,\nWithin the golden chamber, mutually refining—\nWith Central Yellow divine water,\nCyclically revolving,\nAll phenomena converge at the Pool of Flowers.*\n\n*Piercing Heaven, traversing Earth,\nFive *qi* harmonized at the foundation.\nThe Mystic Pass sealed shut,\nBoth orifices closed—\nWood and Metal intermingle,\nRefined into *Wu-Ji* (Five-Six),\nYielding the purple gold herb.*\n\n*Nine transformations congeal—\nPure and turbid mercury-lead,\nFollowing the twin waters’ celestial mechanism,\nThe elixir is born.\nLightly ascending with fire-powder,\nThe elixir’s gem radiates.\"*\n\n**Spring in the Secret Garden:**\n*\"To become a transcendent,\nRefine the golden liquid,\nSeven returns, nine restorations.\nYet marvel at the Female returning to the Male—\nThe Golden Sage resides in *Kan*.\nThe jade furnace blazes,\nThe golden crucible’s smoke chills.\nLead wraps silver,\nSand refines mercury.\nDivine fire questions the Pool of Flowers above and below—\nThe central chamber holds a single path,\nPiercing straight to the Celestial Pass.*\n\n*Dike the golden waters in cyclic exchange,\nOperate the yin-fire and yang-symbols—\nNot trivial.\nObserve the white snow illuminating Heaven,\nYellow buds covering Earth,\nTortoise and serpent entwined,\nBlack Hare and White Rabbit ascending.\nSince ancient times, *Kan* and *Li* in the mortal realm—\nNine transformations of simmering must expose deceit.\nThe omissions lie within humanity.\"*\n\n**Steamer Diagram:**\n*(Diagram omitted per instructions.)*",

On either side, drill holes to insert **golden water tubes** (*jīnshuǐguàn*) up to the **Divine Chamber’s** apex, sealing the surface as one.

      "translated_text": "Take fifty *liang* of the **purple-gold elixir** from the inner furnace, casting it into five **pillars**—the central one four *cùn* low, two *cùn* half high—erected to support the **Divine Chamber**.\n\nNext, take one *jīn* of the **still elixir’s golden essence**, casting it into a **pointed-bottom water furnace** that can cover the golden furnace’s exterior. The pointed bottom must be straight and inserted into the **Chaos Chamber**, sealing it as in the initial stages of elixir refinement.\n\nThen, apply the **residue of the Eighth Return Elixir**—the **golden salve**—as a covering outside the **Chaos Chamber**. Within the **Chaos Chamber**, place one *jīn* of **large cinnabar blocks**, boiled in **Divine Water**. Afterward, use **long-stored cinnabar powder**, regardless of quantity, to spread and fill the chamber. Alternatively, mix dust with finely ground **cinnabar and mercury** to also produce the **Great Return Elixir**.\n\nOnce sealed, place the **Golden Furnace of Water Sea** beneath, inserting and tightly sealing the cracks. Secure the exterior with eighty-one *dǎi liǎng* of **yellow clay**, kneaded with **sal ammoniac, alum, paper fibers**, and other binding agents until firm. The outer furnace’s thickness should be one *zhǐ* half or two *zhǐ* wide. Bind it with sturdy iron wires and suspend it with iron chains inside a **three-tiered Law-Image Divine Furnace**, positioned before the altar. Maintain **incense and flame** day and night, set up a **leakage mechanism**, and regulate **water-fire cycles** according to the **Eight Trigrams and Sixteen Hexagrams**, opening and closing the **Eight Gates**, alternating **fire below and water above**, drawing, adding, and shifting them as needed. Afterward, follow the **weighted measures** to complete the **Great Heavenly Water-Fire Cycle** in one year.\n\nCover the **three-tiered furnace** with a protective enclosure, ensuring no one enters. The following year, remove the furnace from the underground pit, perform **ritual offerings and oaths to the Celestial Sovereign**, and avoid **Water Sea** contamination.\n\nThen, introduce **water into the furnace**, igniting **four surrounding fires** of thirty-six *liang* each for three cycles of ascent.\n\nThus, for nine days, when the final moment arrives, purify the ashes and place them in the **cold furnace** for three nights. The elixir obtained will be **radiant jade-like**, **purple-gold salve**, or **emerald elixir**, its brilliance surpassing the sun.\n\nDivide it into three portions: one to **offer to Heaven** for blessings, one to **save and aid the poor**, and one for **refining and liberating the spirits of the netherworlds**. Bury any remaining elixir, soak it in water for a hundred days to **steam out its poisons**, then roll it into pills—eighty-one grains per portion—using **yellow essence salve** for binding. Consume one portion annually.\n\nFinally, perform the **Grand Ritual Offering** to the **Three Realms of Deities**, swear oaths to the **Three Pure Ones of Heaven**, the **Three Officials and Nine Ministries**, the **ancestral masters of alchemical Daoists**, and the **local deities of the Nine Provinces**. This is done in anticipation of the **ascension**.\n\n**The Great Elixir’s Water-Fire Cycle**\nCommence the fire from **Winter Solstice** on the auspicious day of the **eleventh month**, increasing by one *liang* each day for thirty days until reaching the **ninth month**, then decrease it completely. Before **Established Winter** (立冬), cease the **water-fire cycles** for nine days.\n\nAt this time, select an **auspicious location and day**, establish the altar, and install the furnace. Choose a **south-facing site** with **scenic mountains and waters**, free from human activity, and avoid places with **carrion, graves, or foul qi** from poultry and feline beasts. Purify your mind with **fasting and abstinence**, shun worldly toil, and focus your heart and will on **tending the fire and observing the cycles**. Do not let your thoughts wander to **fame, profit, or sensual desires**. Ideally, three like-minded individuals should join in this endeavor.\n\n**Fire and Water Measures:**\n1st day: **one *liang* of fire**, fourteen *liang* of water.\n2nd day: **two *liang* of fire**, thirteen *liang* of water.\n3rd day: **three *liang* of fire**, twelve *liang* of water.\n4th day: **four *liang* of fire**, eleven *liang* of water.\n5th day: **five *liang* of fire**, ten *liang* of water.\n6th day: **six *liang* of fire**, nine *liang* of water.\n7th day: **seven *liang* of fire**, eight *liang* of water.\n8th day: **eight *liang* of fire** (on the **upper crescent**), seven *liang* of water.\n9th day: **nine *liang* of fire**, six *liang* of water.\n10th day: **ten *liang* of fire**, five *liang* of water.\n11th day: **eleven *liang* of fire**, four *liang* of water.\n12th day: **twelve *liang* of fire**, three *liang* of water.\n13th day: **thirteen *liang* of fire**, two *liang* of water.\n14th day: **fourteen *liang* of fire**, one *liang* of water.\n15th day: **fourteen *liang* of fire**, one *liang* of water.\n16th day: **fourteen *liang* of fire**, one *liang* of water.\n17th day: **thirteen *liang* of fire**, two *liang* of water.\n18th day: **twelve *liang* of fire**, three *liang* of water.\n19th day: **eleven *liang* of fire**, four *liang* of water.\n20th day: **ten *liang* of fire**, five *liang* of water.\n21st day: **nine *liang* of fire**, six *liang* of water.\n22nd day: **eight *liang* of fire**, seven *liang* of water.\n23rd day: **seven *liang* of fire**, eight *liang* of water.\n24th day: **six *liang* of fire**, nine *liang* of water.\n25th day: **five *liang* of fire**, ten *liang* of water.\n26th day: **four *liang* of fire**, eleven *liang* of water.\n27th day: **three *liang* of fire**, twelve *liang* of water.\n28th day: **two *liang* of fire**, thirteen *liang* of water.\n29th day: **one *liang* of fire**, fourteen *liang* of water.\n30th day: **one *liang* of fire** (on the **lower crescent**), fourteen *liang* of water.\n\nThese **fire-water cycles** are the sacred methods of the **Immortal Daoists**, not to be revealed to the vulgar.\n\nFor the **elixir of one *jīn*** (one *jīn* of medicine), **one *jīn* of fire** is required, and **three hundred eighty-four *chǐ*** (one *jīn*) of water is also needed.\n\nEach **yang line** of fire requires two *liang*, each **yin line** of water requires two *liang* and a half. Six lines together yield **fifteen *liang***—the measure of one *jīn*.\n\n**The Heavenly Male (乾) uses nine**, the **Earthly Female (坤) uses six**, totaling **fifteen *liang*** once again.\n\n*(The Secret Essentials of the Golden Flower Elixir Scripture concludes here.)*",
