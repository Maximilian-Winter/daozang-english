  "full_translation": "**The Song of the Mystic Pearl**\n\n*Scripture Title:* The Song of the Mystic Pearl\n*Attributed to:* Master Tongxuan (likely the Tang Daoist Zhang Guo)\n*Source:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Section of Mysteries, Category of Multifarious Arts\n\n**The Song of the Mystic Pearl**\n*Composed by Master Tongxuan*\n\nTo gather the Mystic Pearl is to dispel ten thousand evils,\nAt last attaining the Dao and entering the realm of purity and emptiness.\nThe Qian trigram reveals the true path of gold,\nAll contained within the three volumes of *Xiaoyao*.\n\nPalaces and towers manifest the body of the Dao,\nYet clinging to life’s root cannot withstand the great furnace.\nThe primordial spirit scatters and flees, the withered courtyard remains—\nCast away the Mystic Pearl, and nothing remains.\n\nThe dust-laden heart fails to recognize the heaven within the body,\nVainly revering sacred forms in search of immortality.\nThe Mystic Pearl exists of itself, yet its place is unknown—\nIn what year will one return life to the cinnabar field?\n\nRelying on cleverness to force right and wrong,\nEven hearing the essential teachings, one still resists.\nIf one could but hold fast to the treasure of long life,\nIt would coalesce into the Mystic Pearl, piercing the Purple Tenuity.\n\nSeeking idols of clay or painted images,\nReading scriptures in vain—how can the Dao be achieved?\nThe priceless treasure of the Mystic Pearl exists of itself—\nWhen will one awaken to preserve the spirit’s essence?\n\nLight and darkness share a single source, yet none perceive it;\nIf one could comprehend this, one would naturally attain the wondrous.\nThe Mystic Pearl is surely the master of contained radiance,\nForever abiding in the true palace, the moon’s luminous pool.\n\nBy the waterfall’s stream, compose the spirit’s mechanism,\nUnlock the golden gate and seal the door of life.\nTo secure the Mystic Pearl within the spirit’s abode,\nWhere true unity walks, a single radiance shines.\n\nIf the primordial true essence scatters and cannot be borne,\nPoisons accumulate and spread, harming the hundred spirits.\nOnly by exhausting the supreme treasure of the Mystic Pearl\nWill one awaken from the drunkenness of life and death.\n\nWithin the sea of harmonious qi, the primordial essence is nurtured,\nAnd within it, the Mystic Pearl perfects life.\nWithout refinement or coagulation, desires are cast away—\nHow can darkness suddenly be illuminated?\n\nMastering the spirit’s breath, the body conceals its treasure;\nDeviating from the Dao, one loses the true.\nIf one encounters the Mystic Pearl and coalesces the middle path,\nTransformation into the golden kerchief occurs naturally.\n\nWorldly passions accumulate filth, defiling the gate of heaven—\nHow could one recognize the Mystic Pearl as the root of life?\nAt birth, do not let it drift away in wandering—\nIn that moment of clarity, one avoids confusion and delusion.\n\nThe Mystic Pearl stirs, shattering the demonic horde,\nIlluminating the gate of life, distinguishing white from black.\nAfter steadfast inner cultivation,\nOne achieves the Dao and recognizes the Lords of the Nine Heavens.\n\nTo gather the Mystic Pearl, sun and moon hasten;\nFirst, the fire must arise to temper the spirit’s root.\nAfter ten thousand passages of refining, the golden essence coalesces—\nThis is the foremost gate to ascending transcendence.\n\nThe Mystic Pearl ever dwells in the cavern chamber,\nWhere sun and moon merge into the vast emptiness.\nThe true jade ring follows the transformation of fluids,\nIts unceasing radiance illuminating the spirit’s abode.\n\nThe Mystic Pearl and the jade tree have roots and sprouts,\nBy the water’s edge, touching the sky, they never wither.\nThe true fire, void yet like the red sun,\nCoalesces the golden blossom, the tide of the six watches.\n\nEarly on, one must refine the essence of the great yang,\nConsuming it, the primordial spirit never withers.\nIf one wishes the form to transcend and become golden bones,\nThe Mystic Pearl within holds the purest essence.\n\nFreely drinking the moon’s luminous fluid,\nIt irrigates the spirit’s root, renewing virtue and Dao.\nRetaining the treasure and shedding the dust, radiance does not scatter—\nThe Mystic Pearl illuminates the fivefold body.\n\nComing and going, entering and exiting, transformed into an infant,\nYet disorder in sequence invites calamity.\nThe Mystic Pearl exists in one place with all—\nThrough the master’s guidance, one abides on the cinnabar terrace.\n\nThe Mystic Pearl resounds like thunder,\nFilling the central pool, transforming into eightfold jade.\nFrom this, radiance pierces the heavens,\nAnd the five-colored clouds carry one to Penglai.\n\nWith myriad intentions and countless affairs,\nHow can they compare to returning to the origin and inward contemplation?\nSeizing the Mystic Pearl, one exchanges the bones—\nThe form transcends the azure vault, riding the golden phoenix.\n\nIn tranquility, day and night, never hastening,\nWithin, the Mystic Pearl opens a gate.\nSweeping away worldly toil, dividing sun and moon,\nThe supreme treasure enters Kunlun.\n\nThrough the master’s transmission of secrets, all contention ceases,\nDrawing forth the Mystic Pass, a single path becomes clear.\nThe celestial music endures, its sound unbroken—\nThe Mystic Pearl is fulfilled, and the red dragon welcomes.\n\nExamining the eightfold radiance,\nOne swallows the true fire, the body within burns.\nThe Mystic Pearl opens the granary of the Three Clarities,\nAwaiting the day to ride the five-colored clouds together.\n\nFailing to awaken to the true origin, one is startled and bewildered,\nFollowing the heart’s desires, indulging the Three Corpses.\nWhere the Mystic Pearl arrives, nothing can defile it—\nThe treasure fills the jade pool, reaching the Upper Clarity.\n\nHaving attained the Mystic Pearl, contention ceases forever,\nWithout leaving the cinnabar origin, the treasure coalesces.\nThrough turning and refining, it becomes as clear as the moon,\nEver pure and luminous within the grain.\n\nLosing the Mystic Pearl, it falls into ruins,\nWandering and drifting, mistakenly rolled and unrolled.\nIf the hun and po congeal like sun and moon,\nThe body unites with heaven and earth in purity and emptiness.\n\nThe Mystic Pearl coalesces the po in a single surge,\nSending it into the jade tower, the highest palace.\nLike the moon’s light, able to emerge and submerge,\nNaturally, one lightly ascends into the clouds.\n\nCountless have practiced this art before,\nOnly to suddenly transcend the mortal form.\nThousands of immortals follow this method—\nThe Mystic Pearl illuminates the primal integrity of the One.\n\nThrough the master’s guidance, the sunlight follows,\nTransforming the Mystic Pearl into feathered robes.\nWhen merit is complete and the supreme Dao attained,\nBefore ascending the cloud path, none will know.\n\nFreely composing to reveal the void,\nWithout leaving the field of the body, one points to the Dao’s form.\nInternally divided into upper, middle, and lower,\nTracing the path, one fully attains the Mystic Pearl.\n\n**The Song of the Mystic Pearl concludes.**",
