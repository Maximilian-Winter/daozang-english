Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. One fascicle. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, *Weiyi* category.\n\n---\n\nWhen commanding the altar, first prepare the water and sword, secure the earthly gate, and set up the altar documents above. Proceed to the place of the sword and water, first visualizing one’s master in the west. Next, visualize the Three Generals, then envision a true official in crimson robes riding the Dipper to arrive. Then make the declaration:\n\n\"I have heard that none surpass the myriad spirits in harmonizing yin and yang, nor does anything exceed the Great Dao in aiding family and state. Thus, the Azure Vault undergoes changes of fortune and misfortune, which people rectify; the Yellow Register contains rites of deliverance, which people cultivate. Though unworthy, I admire the mysterious transformation, humbly bear the registers of the Dao, and presumptuously hold the office of governance. Having traversed mountains and rivers, how dare I forget repayment? On this day, the first of the month in such-and-such a year, I reverently conduct this ritual in such-and-such a prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, leading a number of Daoist priests. I respectfully perform this rite for the disciple of the Great Dao, so-and-so, to establish a fast of so many days and nights for such-and-such a purpose: to avert calamity, dispel misfortune, invoke blessings, and pray for grace. Having erected the altar and followed the ritual protocols, I submit this memorial. I have purified my form and refined my qi, calmed my heart and stilled my spirit, and now fulfill the appointed time. How dare I not make this known above?\n\nI humbly entreat the Most High to issue renewing decrees and unfold the grace of nurturing cover. May the decrees descend to the true officials, who will divide their offices and descend to witness this. Let the mists and clouds temporarily cease in the Three Realms, and wind and rain not be visited upon the Four Darknesses. May repentance be heard, and petitions transmitted without hindrance. I cannot express the depth of my earnest devotion. I concentrate my spirit and await the response.\"\n\nAfter visualizing the response, next visualize the Four Spirits. Then pass the altar documents to another. Next, lower the hands and clasp them firmly, summoning the Four Spirits:\n\n**Eastern Green Dragon**, essence of Horn and Neck,\nSpouting clouds and dense qi, devouring thunder and emitting sound,\nSoaring through the Eight Extremes, roaming the Four Darknesses,\nCome and stand at my left.\n\n**Southern Vermilion Bird**, chief of all fowl,\nBorn from the Cinnabar Cave, flowing resonance in the Azure Empyrean,\nWondrous hues of five colors, divine forms of six images,\nCome and guide before me.\n\n**Western White Tiger**, corresponding to Beak and Triaster,\nRadiant and pure in substance, solemn and clear in sound,\nInspiring awe among beasts, howling to stir the mountains and forests,\nCome and attend at my right.\n\n**Northern Dark Warrior**, born of Great Yin,\nManifesting in Void and Rooftop, combining the forms of tortoise and serpent,\nCoiling through the Nine Lands, governing the hundred spirits,\nCome and follow behind me.\n\nNext, bring the hands together over the heart, stand in the *ding*-character stance, and recite the incantation:\n\n\"I summon the hundred spirits. Once assembled, they shall travel with me,\nGirded by the sun and moon, traversing the Nine Provinces.\nSixteen divine generals serve as my messengers,\nHeavenly, earthly, and water officials share in this blessing.\"\n\nNext, perform the *Three Powers Step* toward the sword and water. Hold the sword in the right hand and recite the incantation:\n\n\"As the Five Phases revolve—fire, wood, water, metal, earth—\nI wield this unyielding sword to command and restrain spirits and gods.\nThe Twenty-Eight Constellations follow my direction,\nThe Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper flank the numinous perfected.\nCirculating through the ten thousand directions,\nA hundred blessings converge as one.\"\n\nNext, hold the water bowl in the left hand and recite the incantation:\n\n\"Not the waters of the Jiang, He, Huai, or Sea,\nBut the five dragons’ exhalation, purifying heaven and earth.\nThe Great Emperor consumed them for thirty thousand years.\nToday, I take them to cleanse perverse qi.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\"\n\nNext, face the sword and water toward each other and state one’s name and title:\n\n*Tai Xuan Du Orthodox Unity, Pacified Qi, Celestial Master of the [X] Register, [X] Qi, Libationer of the Red Heaven, Three-Five Step Network, Original Destiny Perfected Person, [Name]*\n\nReverently invite the **Green Emperor of the East** and the **Green Dragon**, bearing talismans and swords, into my water.\nReverently invite the **Red Emperor of the South** and the **Red Dragon**, bearing talismans and swords, into my water.\nReverently invite the **White Emperor of the West** and the **White Dragon**, bearing talismans and swords, into my water.\nReverently invite the **Black Emperor of the North** and the **Qi Dragon**, bearing talismans and swords, into my water.\nReverently invite the **Yellow Emperor of the Center** and the **Yellow Dragon**, bearing talismans and swords, into my water.\n\n\"My water is no ordinary water—it is the water of the five dragons and five stars, the true qi.\nMy sword is no ordinary sword—nine times tempered, unyielding and firm,\nFlanked by the Seven Stars, treading the Northern Dipper,\nStraddling the *Kui* and *Gang* stars.\nThe Great Unity transforms it into water, circulating through the ten thousand directions.\nNothing is purer than water, nothing fouler than filth.\nWith purity, govern the turbid; with water, govern filth.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Most High Lord Lao! Sprinkle and spray the water.\"\n\nNext, the ritual master proceeds to the Gate of Heaven, stands briefly, and visualizes the Four Spirits. Then recite the *Yu Step* incantation:\n\n\"Revered Qian, radiant spirit,\nCompliant Kun, inner nurturing,\nThe Two Modes harmonize in prosperity, essential for beneficial integrity.\nMatching heaven and earth, eternal peace and solemn clarity,\nResponding to the mysterious and yellow, above the robe and below the skirt,\nZhen, Li, Kan, Dui, Xun aiding and assisting,\nQian, Kun, Gen, Xun, tiger’s step and dragon’s soaring,\nGate of Heaven, Gate of Earth, Gate of Humans, Gate of Ghosts,\nWho guards me? The vast heaven, azure and boundless.\nToday, my Yu Step aligns with the celestial network.\nGhosts and spirits submit in reverence,\nBelow, banishing inauspiciousness.\nMay my prayers be fulfilled as desired,\nResponding in timely numinous radiance.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\"\n\nNext, proceed to the northeast corner, face east, and invite the **Green Youth Lord**:\n\nReverently invite the **Green Youth Lord of the East**,\nNine thousand myriad *zhang* in height,\nAttended by ninety million officials,\nRiding the essence of the Year Star of the East,\nTrue qi floating in the void, descending to the altar.\nDeploy spirits and spread qi,\nSearch out perverse essences,\nExpel demonic thieves—\nThose guilty shall not be pardoned.\nSprinkle and spray the water.\n\nNext, perform the *Yu Step* to the southeast corner, sprinkle and spray the water, shout the command, face south, and invite the **Red Youth Lord**:\n\nReverently invite the **Red Youth Lord of the South**,\nThree thousand myriad *zhang* in height,\nAttended by thirty million officials,\nRiding the essence of the Sparkling Deluder Star of the South,\nTrue qi floating in the void, descending to the altar.\nDeploy spirits and spread qi,\nSearch out perverse essences,\nBurn and destroy demonic thieves—\nThose guilty shall not be pardoned.\nSprinkle and spray the water.\n\nNext perform the *Yu Step* to the southwest corner, sprinkle and spray the water, shout the command, face west, and invite the **White Youth Lord**:\n\nReverently invite the **White Youth Lord of the West**,\nSeventy million *zhang* in height,\nAttended by seventy million officials,\nRiding the essence of the Great White Star of the West,\nTrue qi floating in the void, descending to the altar.\nDeploy spirits and spread qi,\nSearch out perverse essences,\nExecute and slay demonic thieves—\nThose guilty shall not be pardoned.\nSprinkle and spray the water.\n\nNext perform the *Yu Step* to the northwest corner, sprinkle and spray the water, shout the command, face north, and invite the **Black Youth Lord**:\n\nReverently invite the **Black Youth Lord of the North**,\nFifty million *zhang* in height,\nAttended by fifty million officials,\nRiding the essence of the Chronogram Star of the North,\nTrue qi floating in the void, descending to the altar.\nDeploy spirits and spread qi,\nSearch out perverse essences,\nDrown and sweep away demonic thieves—\nThose guilty shall not be pardoned.\nSprinkle and spray the water.\n\nNext perform the *Yu Step* to the upper direction, sprinkle and spray the water, face north, and invite the **Yellow Youth Lord**:\n\nReverently invite the **Yellow Youth Lord of the Center**,\nOne hundred twenty thousand *zhang* in height,\nAttended by one hundred twenty thousand officials,\nRiding the essence of the Quelling Star of the Center,\nTrue qi floating in the void, descending to the altar.\nDeploy spirits and spread qi,\nSearch out perverse essences,\nBury and conceal demonic thieves—\nThose guilty shall not be pardoned.\nSprinkle and spray the water.\n\nNext proceed to the Ghost Gate or Earth Gate, step the Seven Stars backward—establishing toward the Destructor—turn the body and enter the Dipper, clad in the Dipper and treading the Dipper. Visualize the celestial officials’ troops and horses, the gods of the sun, moon, and constellations, the immortals, the soldiers and horses of the Five Peaks and Four Seas—each nine hundred million in number—arrayed vividly before the eyes. The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior stand in formation to the left and right. Then make the second invocation.\n\nNext, once more declare the ritual rank:\n*Grand Mystery Capital, Orthodox Unity, Pacified Qi, Celestial Master of [X] Realm, [X] Qi Libationer, Red Heaven’s Three-Five Step-Net Primordial Destiny Perfected, your servant [Name], on behalf of the Great Dao, disciple [Name], having established the [X] Retreat for [X] days and nights, beseeches grace, repents transgressions, invokes blessings, and averts calamities. We reverently summon the celestial immortals’ troops and horses—nine hundred million strong; the terrestrial immortals’ troops and horses—nine hundred million strong; the sun, moon, and constellations’ troops and horses—nine hundred million strong; the gods and immortals’ troops and horses—nine hundred million strong; the Five Peaks and Four Seas’ troops and horses—nine hundred million strong. Each is urgently dispatched, galloping like wind, rumbling like thunder, surging like rain, and racing like clouds. United, they descend at once. Today, at this very hour, let them arrive here, encircle the altar thrice, roof it with three layers, spread the Celestial Net above, and lay the Earthly Web below. Let the Nine Lands combine their efforts, the troops and horses array in formation. Within the altar grounds, beside the gates and doors, between wells and hearths, beneath flowers and fruits—wherever lurk lingering corpses, stale qi, the hundred spirits of earth and wood, cat-demons, wild sorcerers, living men, or malevolent curses—seize all disobedient demonic thieves and consign them beneath the *Kui* and *Gang* stars, plunging them ten thousand *zhang* into the earth, motionless and inert. Hasten! As the statutes command.*\n\nSprinkle and spray the water.\n\nNext, gaze upon the sword and recite the Five Phases Incantation:\n\nThe Five Phases propel one another, the firm holds supreme authority. The Six Disciplines assist me, the Three Terraces ward off wrongdoing. Heaven revolves and earth turns, yin and yang unfold. Bestowing life and transcending the world, sun and moon shine together.\n\nNext, raise the sword and point it toward the ground, reciting the incantation:\n*\"By the radiant amnesty of Heaven, by the square amnesty of Earth, where Yu’s steps tread, the hundred demons hide in submission. Hasten! As the statutes command.\"*\n\nSprinkle and spray the water.\n\nThen slash backward with the sword, turn the body to the right, step out of the Dipper’s path, tread upon the stars until the *Wai* and *Bi* constellations are complete, and proceed with the ritual and the Dao. The Rectifying Unity Altar Rite is now concluded.",
