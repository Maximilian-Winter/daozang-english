  "full_translation": "**The Direct Teachings of Perfected One Dan Yang**\n\n**Title:** *The Direct Teachings of Perfected One Dan Yang*\n**Recorded by:** Jin Magang\n**One fascicle.**\n**Source of base text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Section Zhengyi, Part One.\n\n---\n\nThe Perfected One addressed his disciples at the Chongyang Assembly on Mount Longmen, saying:\n\nIn daily practice, one must not deceive Heaven and Earth above. Always cultivate with reverent care, for even an inch of time is precious—do not squander the days, but remain ever vigilant. Sleep, though a natural desire, must be transformed; otherwise, it is not true seated meditation. The mind must remain settled, for whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, one is always practicing the Dao.\n\nGentlemen, do not stir thoughts or stir the mind. Seek diligently for your inherent nature and life-destiny. Simply by calming the mind and dispelling desires, you become a divine immortal. Do not misrecognize this, do not doubt—these are true and authentic words.\n\nStrive always for purity and clarity. Exert yourself in practice, and through repeated awakening, verify it with your own mind. Desires will naturally fade, nature will naturally stabilize, life-destiny will naturally abide, the elixir will naturally form, and you will naturally become an immortal. No one else can do this for you.\n\nEach must apply effort in cultivation—do not be overly hasty, but remain carefree and at ease. Disciples, had the master not revealed this, you would not have recognized it as the wondrous Dharma. Now, I dare not transmit it to others.\n\nGentlemen, simply cease all doubt, for a mind without doubt is one who has attained the Dao. Abide constantly in the principle of non-action, purity, and spontaneity. Further, emit the \"smoke and fire\"—practicing thus, you are a true divine immortal.\n\nThe master said: The twelve double-hours of the day see Heaven and Earth in ceaseless motion, revolving and transforming creation. Do they ever pause for breath? Those who practice the Dao must emulate the way of Heaven, remaining without the slightest halt through the twelve double-hours, revolving and transforming creation within themselves.\n\nAlways maintain purity, never allowing even the faintest dust-like thought to arise—this is cultivation. Practicing thus, you will become a divine immortal in short order. Yet if, within the twelve double-hours, not a single moment is devoted wholeheartedly to the Dao, how can you ever attain liberation? How will you repay the offerings of patrons from the ten directions? The moment your eyes close in death, you will descend into the Dark Realm, suffering for kalpas without end, with no hope of escape.\n\nI now exhort you: I have told you what the Dao is. Follow this practice—do not err. If your practice falls short, do not blame the teachings or the master. Does each of you not consider the suffering of your seven generations of ancestors, who endured boundless karmic afflictions in hopes that their descendants would attain the Dao, relying on Heaven’s mercy to be delivered and reborn in the celestial realms?\n\nThe master further addressed the assembly: Each day, you must not forget your daily tasks, which are of two kinds: outer daily tasks and inner daily tasks.\n\nOuter daily tasks require you to strictly avoid seeing the faults of others, boasting of your own virtues, disparaging the worthy, envying the capable, kindling the fire of ignorance, harboring worldly thoughts, fostering a competitive mind, engaging in disputes over self and others, or indulging in contentious speech or clinging affection.\n\nInner daily tasks require you to refrain from doubt, never forgetting the inner work. Whether wandering, staying, sitting, or lying down, calm the mind and dispel desires, remaining unattached and unobstructed, unstained and unclinging—truly pure, truly clear, carefree and at ease. Maintain mindfulness of the Dao as if, when hungry, you crave food, or when thirsty, you crave drink. At the slightest deviation, correct it immediately. Practicing thus, you will soon become a divine immortal.\n\nYou will not err—if you do, I shall bear the punishment of eternal damnation in hell. Be vigilant and practice accordingly.\n\nThe master said: Over the long course of time, maintain your original resolve without wavering. Do not grow lax or act recklessly. Preserve your natural state, restrain joy and anger, respond to external circumstances while inwardly nurturing stability. Forget scheming in the mind, let intention not cling to things, and in all encounters, do not generate the dual qi of envy and disparagement.\n\nAlways remain pure, and the One Spirit will naturally abide. Water and fire intermingle, Kan and Li unite as one. Without scent or sound, without path or direction, movement arises yet does not give birth—guard this and attain the essence.\n\nThe daily practice of the divine immortal is like sweet dew. As you progress, you will know for yourself—see how you awaken.\n\nThe Great Dao is formless, the ancestor of qi, the mother of spirit. Spirit and qi are nature and life-destiny; nature and life-destiny are dragon and tiger; dragon and tiger are lead and mercury; lead and mercury are water and fire; water and fire are the infant and the maiden; the infant and the maiden are yin and yang; true yin and true yang are simply spirit and qi. Though these are variously named, none should be clung to—only the two words \"spirit and qi\" matter.\n\nTo nurture qi and preserve spirit, you must constantly sever all worldly ties, maintaining purity within and without, and guard it unceasingly with unbroken continuity. After three years without leakage, the lower elixir forms; after six years without leakage, the middle elixir forms; after nine years without leakage, the great elixir forms. When the three elixirs are complete, this is called the \"Ninefold Great Achievement,\" also known as the \"Fulfillment of Three Thousand Merits.\" When the three fields are complete, it is called the \"Divine Elixir.\" The Dharma-body becomes light and ascends, and you will forever be a divine immortal.\n\nI scoff at the claim that Heaven and Earth cannot endure forever. Why does Heaven collapse, Earth sink, mountains crumble, and seas dry up? All that has form must decay. But that which is cultivated first—formless and imageless—how could it ever decay?\n\n**The Direct Teachings of Perfected One Dan Yang concludes.**",
