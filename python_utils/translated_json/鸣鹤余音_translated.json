Yī* (呜鹤余音卷之一) – *Volume One: Resonant Echoes of the Crane’s Cry*\n- *Xiān Yóu Shān Dào Shì Péng Zhì Zhōng Jí* (仙游山道士彭致中集) – *Collected Works of Daoist Master Péng Zhìzhōng of Mount Xiānyóu*\n\n---\n\n**《Xié Hóng》 (解红) – *Untangling the Red***\n**By Lǚ Chún Yáng (吕纯阳)**\n\n*Dòng Tiān Shēn Chù* (洞天深处) – *In the depths of the Celestial Cavern,*\nThe Dao is not distant—yet within arm’s reach, few can awaken.\nLike a child lost in inner visions, one must rely on the artisan’s skill and labor.\nWaiting eagerly for dawn’s light, when a single ray of yang illuminates the path to the mysterious.\nAll treasures lie hidden in the fathomless jade-green waves.\n\nAt that moment, the master descends—\nEarth’s thunder shakes the mountain peaks, rain pours forth.\nGradually, the golden buds are nourished, now emerging from the soil.\nLike a babe plucked from the earth, carried in a basket to depart.\nToward the true realm of six yangs, where the cauldron’s fire simmers.\nThe essence is refined, east and west, south and north—\nLaying out the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces,\nTo discern the lineage of the ancestors.\nWithin the Ten Celestial Stems, left and right are divided,\nTo reveal the Dragon and the Tiger.\nWith the Black Tortoise following and the Vermilion Bird leading,\nAuspicious clouds spread.\nOn the River of the Curved Banks,\nAll deities gather—husbands and wives.\nThe *Gǔi Mǔ* (癸母) rides the Red Dragon,\nReturning to the Cavern’s palace.\nSeeking the Golden Old Man,\nOne must ask through [the proper] means.\nThe union of yin and yang spans three thousand cycles.\n\nPointing to heaven, earth, sea, and mountain,\nTheir shared longevity is unshaken and firm.\n\n---\n**《Wú Lì Wǎng Zǐ》 (吴立网子) – *Master Wú’s Net of Illusions***\n\nTo become an immortal, one must embrace the *yuán qì* (元炁),\nBreathing in the womb, nurturing it endlessly.\nEach breath is a refining, each exhalation a distillation.\nYin and yang merge, the Red Dragon coils.\nThe earthly portal is sealed, the heavenly gate opens—\nRolling the cinnabar elixir into the *níhuàn* (泥丸),\nThe marrow’s core.\nOn Kunlun’s heights, the luminous pearl glows,\nAnd the agate shimmers.\nOne furnace’s fire extinguishes another’s elixir.\nThe heart’s ashes reveal five colors, radiant and bright.\nOn the double-gated path, the *qi* flows unbroken.\nClasping the true flower, ascending to the elixir field.\nThe *Cháng Nǚ Yīng’ér* (姹女婴儿) rejoices in union,\nRiding the celestial chariot, earthly fire and thunder shift.\nThe *Lì Quán Jiǔ* (醴泉酒) is drunk—\nAt every moment, after sipping, one lies intoxicated in the Peach Blossom Source.\nNo cares to dissolve.\n\n---\n**《Wú Sú Niàn》 (无俗念) – *Without Worldly Thoughts***\n\nThe profound Dao of Complete Perfection is boundless,\nWondrously attained by those who grasp the essence of the Perfect Ones.\n\nThe Dao of Primal Mystery is spoken through—\nSilently intuiting its movements within.\nAll things fully manifested in essence,\nResponding to circumstances, uniquely revealed—\nAwakened, life’s completion is achieved.\n\nThough this truth is clear,\nThe practice demands unbroken, meticulous refinement.\nBow the head to hide the celestial secret.\nWithout the Master’s guidance,\nHow could this be known?\n\nWho governs the myriad classes of the Three Realms?\nThe foundation of Heaven and Earth stands alone.\nEndless transformations,\nBoundless containment—\nIts operations leave no trace.\n\nPiercing the void,\nRadiant light pervades the boundless expanse.\nThe Three Reds dissolve—\nFor the True Person of Unity,\nThe Primal Oneness is split asunder.\n\nWhen does the cycle of the Four Births and Six Paths cease?\nTurning the body, changing the shell,\nIn the boundless void, myriad births and deaths unfold.\nAll arise from parents,\nYin and Yang paired, their vital *qi* and blood mingling.\nWithin the amniotic sac,\nFeeling takes form, the embryo’s shape is sealed.\nWho knows the stench of the birth canal?\nTaking it as one’s own fine dwelling.\nBurrowing in, one falls into the wheel of transmigration.\nThe form and bones are sold—\nPiled high like mountains.\n\nSeeking the Dao and cultivating the True,\nDo not cling to perverse ways.\nSpeak not of the Dragon and Tiger,\nNor debate the Tortoise and Serpent.\nDo not pursue the *Cháng Nǚ Yīng’ér*,\nBut gather the Four Symbols and Three Vehicles.\n*Sword-pill* and *lead-mercury*—\nWater, fire, golden sprouts, and white snow.\n\nA hundred methods of breathing,\nYet the *shén* (神) harmonizes with *qi* (氣) in subtle play.\nWithin nature, let no foreign thing take root,\nOn the heart, ever sever all attachments.\nAlone, the hidden moon shines deep and still.\nFree the luminous spirit—\nUnobstructed, unbound.\nNo barriers, no veils.\n\n---\n**[Zhengtune Mode] Black Lacquer Bow #1**\n**Qiu Changchun**\nMy home is at the edge of the Parrot State,\nA fisherman who does not know his letters.\nAmidst the waves, a single leaf of a flat-bottomed boat,\nSleeping through the misty rains of the southern Jiang.\nAwakening, my eyes are filled with verses—\nGreen mountains at dusk, shaking off the green raincoat to depart.\nIn thought, I recall how I once blamed the Craft of Heaven,\nYet even so, it has arranged my place.\n\nThe Celestial Moon #2 sinks in the day’s light,\nThe sun sets in the west—\nAscending the lofty terrace,\nGazing far, the vast emptiness of heaven and earth unfolds.\nSparse stars flicker faintly,\n**[Empty Mode]** A single breath of brightness—\nThe luminous moon, resplendent and without grasp.\nRadiant beyond the Three Realms,\nLike a hundred-fold refined bronze mirror, washed clean.\nIts grace pervades everywhere,\nIlluminating every household,\nCasting a dim glow upon halls and doors.\n\nThe wind of eternal life sweeps ten thousand leagues,\nAiding the Dao in its boundless sway,\nScattering clouds and mists without effort.\nThe Hall of Celestial Treasures,\nNow bathed in crimson radiance and golden splendor,\nTheir hues intermingling in splendor.\nOh, the grandeur of the fading night!\nIt steadies the eternal—\nA majestic, unyielding embrace.\n\nIf one has resolve to climb the green cassia,\nAt the Moon Palace’s edge, near the rabbit’s abode,\nThey watch the elixir being refined.\n\n**Spring Descends from Heaven**\n**Feng Zunshi**\nThe Dao is profound and mysterious.\n\nThe Dao appears like the moon full in the cold void,\nIts depths like water humbling into the abyss.\nResplendent and clear, it discerns all without bias—\nTruly, this principle is beyond speech.\n\nAsk the lofty sage, who points from afar:\n\"See the falling petals and drifting silk of spring!\"\nGrass stretches to the sky.\nAh, the yellow blossoms and verdant bamboos—\nWhat difference from true Zen?\n\nClouds and mountains in ten thousand layers,\nBroken and continuous,\nYet deeper still the quiet valleys and ravines,\nCold as stones in deep pools.\nMist enfolds the pine pavilions,\nA breeze stirs the orchid halls.\nAt times, it rests upon a pure table,\nForgetting all explanation.\n\nBefore the empty hall’s untrammelled grace,\nThe heart grows still—\nNaturally serene, beyond all taste.\nTo whom shall it be passed?\n\nThere are jars and lamps, their flickering flames,\nKettles and cauldrons, their smoke sunk low.\n\n**The Second Verse**\nThe sun and moon race heavenward.\nThis profound and wondrous mechanism—\nHow rare for dusty mortals to hear!\nIn the **Taiyi’s** cauldron,\nBy the mouth of the pure river,\nLingzhi mushrooms bloom, their orchid fragrance rising.\nBehold the golden lotus’ splendid scene,\nSpouting auspicious clouds,\nUnveiling the gate of life.\nThe Dao alone is revered.\nIt further nurtures the myriad transformations,\nCovering and sustaining the heavens and earth.\nHow then does one enjoy the four seasons?\nThrough endless, silent continuity—\nFirm roots, unshaken foundation.\nOpposing and yielding to yin and yang,\nExhausting and penetrating past and present,\nResponding to change like a god.\n\nThis is the ultimate Daoist truth,\nTranscending names and forms,\nSudden enlightenment of the true essence.\nThe rare and refined.\n\nToward **Huaxu’s** gathering,\nTogether savoring eternal spring.\n\n**The Third Verse**\n**Recognizing the rise and fall,**\nAll things forgotten, dwelling in rustic ease.\nWorldly fame and fortune,\nSky-shaking wealth and rank—\nNone escape the objects’ relentless pull.\nAh, within the **Southern Grove’s** dream,\nHow many wise and foolish souls were lost!\nThis humble abode—\nWho would count the share of each?\nWho would dare return?\n\nOnly I, carefree and unbound,\nLet nature guide me—\nFree as the wind, without constraint.\nStraw hats and raincoats stacked idle,\nLutes and books hung high,\nWorldly tasks grown cold and distant.\nUpon the stone between the pines,\nI chant of wind and moon—\nOf **clouds and waters**, emotions unconfined.\nIn the company of **Pure Void**,\nResting on misty peaks,\nTrue joy knows no end.\n\n**Understanding Red**,\nI lean upon a staff and walk slowly.\n\n**Crossing the little bridge,**\nI wander freely to the Southern Marsh.\nThe bloom of youth has faded unseen—\nSuddenly, the willows turn emerald once more.\n\nThe eastern suburbs after the rain’s retreat,\nWhere does the golden oriole’s languid song drift?\nGazing upon clouds and mountains, veiled and revealed,\nBeyond the misty stream, the setting sun grows pale.\nAs evening’s cool breath lingers,\nThe bamboo wind carries its fragrant passage.\n\nThis idle span of time—\nTo whom shall I confide its fleeting weight?\nA hundred years in this dusty world—\nHow few can they truly count?\nLike bubbles on the water’s surface,\nFading in and out—\nThe lost may never wake to their true nature.\n\nReturning now, I fear the fields may grow wild,\nThe garden overrun with neglect.\nBy the eastern fence,\nI laugh at the world’s petty schemes, my heart unbound—\nNo care for lutes or books.\n\nWithin the **green pine’s** shade,\nBeneath the thatched eaves,\nI tend my frail, remaining frame.\nLet the world’s **objects and transformations** churn and rage,\nDriving the tides of past and future.\nBetter I, who drift through life—\nLazy, poor, and plain—\nWhen spirits rise, I sing;\nWhen weary, I sleep;\nWhen wild, I dance.\nAll worldly affairs, their tangled fuss,\nI leave to drift beyond my ken.\nLet others call me fool, let them think me crude.\nWith **clear wind and bright moon** as my companions,\nI hide in secluded **hut and marsh**—\nA **Second Lord’s** slow gait,\n**Dan Yang’s** ease,\nAnd the **Xian**’s aloof grace.\n\n「Then take action—first, dispel lust and desire.\nSeek the noble man of jade-like purity and ice-like clarity.\nDo not linger, mired in mud and splashed by water.\nOnce lost, the human body is hard to reclaim.\nDo not trifle with your fate—guard your future path with care.\n\nNow I briefly recount:\nFive essentials for enduring life and long vision—rely upon these.\nFirst, purify all thoughts and worries.\nSecond, renounce greed and abstain from wine, meat, and fish.\nThird, aid the poor and relieve suffering.\nFourth, always practice benevolence and charity.\nFifth, preserve your vital essence and spirit.\n\nFollow these five principles,\nPerform deeds with perfect virtue,\nAnd you shall attain the Daoist path to Penglai.\n*Golden Immortals bear alms of dew*—\n**Zhenren of Shan Mountain**,\nEnjoying the rustic village’s winds and moons, trusting the years to pass in exchange.\n\nAll day, sheltering behind the thatched gate,\nIn quiet chambers, idly browsing ancient texts with languid ease.\nSitting with composure, walking alone—\nSever all ties to fame and name.\n\nEmbrace the primordial yang,\nForget the world, dissolve in stillness,\nQi and spirit harmonized—\nAscend and descend without hindrance,\nRefine the elixir to its purest treasure,\nCultivate serenity, gentle rebirth.\nSilent and unassuming, returning to the source,\nNurture the true essence, restore the uncarved.\n\nStill and clear, tame the restless mind—\nNo more disturbance from thoughts like wild monkeys.\nFree and unrestrained, indulge in boundless joy.\nAt ease and unshackled,\nWhen deeds are fulfilled and virtue complete,\nAttain the state of no-birth—\nLet the world’s affairs rush by,\nUnconcerned with their rise and fall.\nThe world’s passions grow distant.\n\nSeekers of the Dao must not delay.\nSweet dew falls on lofty pines,\nTime flees swift—\nAlas, mortals day by day,\nCling to life without end.\n\nIf wealth surpasses Shi Chong’s stone,\nGold and jade piled high,\nWhat gain is there but boundless karma?\nDaily deceit and falsehood weigh upon the heart.\nEven the Lord of Hell calls—\nYour past sins await,\nWho will answer for you?\n\nBetter to cultivate early,\nJoin the Daoist immortals beyond the world,\nCast off the mundane.\n\nSilent and profound,\nAnother realm unfolds—\nThe boundless expanse of the *Cauldron*’s world.\nManifesting all beings,\nMoonlight shines bright—\nBehold the Dharma-realm, spirit and light as one.\nReturn, and the Clear Wind escorts you to the Celestial Emperor.\n\n*Raindrops fall*—\n**Song Pi Yun**, high mountains and flowing waters.\nAh, how few are the true kindred in this world—\nSouth of the Zhongnan Range, mist and clouds stretch ten thousand li.\nReturn, for the years grow old.\nStaff, elixir, and scrolls—\nBeyond these, what baggage do you carry?\nDelight in simplicity, uphold the family Dao of purity,\nA single luminous spirit-mirror, clear as washed.\n\nWithin its marvels, the teacher points the way—\nStrive to banish the specter of impermanence.\nSheathe the three-foot spirit-sword,\nThunderous strikes—\nThe Fire Dragon takes flight.\n\nWhen the world knows peace,\nBetween the white clouds,\nLaugh and roam at will.\nThe worldly seekers of fame and gain,\nDo not understand enduring life—\nChasing through the dusty red world.\n\n**Second Poem**\n*Seven-petal golden lotus*—\nThe Gan River’s depths, casually pierced.\nQiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Sun, and Wang,\nHao Taigu and Xu Lai—\nTwo true companions wrapped in coarse mats,\nLeak not a drop of time,\nThe teacher’s cause and effect revealed.\n\nBlooming lotus petals,\nTen thousand flowers in unison,\nFragrant mist fills the world—\n*Celestial blessings seal it.*\nThe Jiazi year passes not in vain,\nNow the Daoist immortals and heavenly beings rejoice in your awakening.\n\nThe *Quanzhen*’s household is profound,\nIndeed, within it—\nOne must forget self and others.\nBranches split nineteenfold,\nDwelling on the Dan Platform,\nSurname, title, and name all spread.\nDeeds and practice lack not a thread,\nYet the upper realms admit me not.\n\n*Playing on the Jade Terrace*—\n**Feng Zunshi**,\nDirectly pointing to the *Xuan Yuan* Path.\nAlas, the *苦海*’s delusion blinds mortals.\nBefore you, smooth and steady,\nNo peril or obstacle to hinder.\n\nCast aside all worldly ties—\nAwakening arises on its own.\nLike cranes breaking free from clouds,\nToward the boundless Daoist skies, stride with faith.\nCelebrate the immortal companions.\nWhen thirsty, drink ambrosial peaches,\nFermented in sweet wine.\nEntering and exiting star pavilions and moon halls,\nLaugh at the world’s birth and death, past and future.\n\nRiding the auspicious phoenix and blessed crane,\nAscend to the *Tai Pei*’s void—\nReturn to repose in the depths of *Bi Xia*.\nThis untrammled life is hard to share—\nEntrust it to the Penglai companions.\n\n**Third Poem: Ode to Tea**\n*One breath exchanged*—\nA thunderous shake, one sound—\nThe yellow sprout emerges.\nThe *Jade Maiden* picks it,\nSeals it in the cauldron,\nRefines it without flaw.\n\nThe iron wheel turns ten thousand times,\nThe tea leaves tremble—\nA thousand infusions reveal no end.\nLike the *Dharma’s* use,\nThe craft perfected—\nSavor it in every moment.\n\nWorthy of praise—\nThe Daoist child’s skill,\nFloating tea leaves like spring snow, beyond compare.\nBanish the sleep demon,\nSever the path of the Way,\nExpose the superficial.\n\n*Zhaozhou* knows its taste,\n*Lu Quan* reaches this truth—\nAll lead to the immortal realm.\nThis tea cup—\nMay all awaken early,\nTogether bound for mist and clouds.\n\n**Fourth Poem: Yellow Root Dream**\n*Yellow Root*—\nThe dream dissolves.\n\n**First Poem:**\n\nBanish the fleeting vanities before your eyes—\nReflect fiercely, break free from the mundane cage.\nBeyond the world, what chains remain?\nFollow the *Zhen*’s shadow, befriend the *Xia*’s glow,\nRoam where winds are neighbors, moons your companions.\nThe carefree wanderer—\nBound by no rule.\nSkimming green waters, savoring blue mountains,\nDissolving into ease.\n\nSuch joy—\nNo gold could trade.\nLet others scramble for fame, wealth, and power.\nBut I seek only a leftward turn—\nLiving on simple fare,\nClaiming all of life’s languid ease.\n\nMorning to evening, a pillow of deep slumber,\nStretching limbs in boundless ease.\nWithin the red dust—\nObserve well:\nWho matches my leisure?\nWorthy of envy.\n\nIn this idle state, there lies another art—\nThe *Cloud-Holding* technique.\n\n---\n\n**Second Poem: [Qiu Changchun] #3**\nA life of indolence—\nOnly earning a pillow of carefree repose.\nWild-haired, filthy-faced,\nUnmoved by the body’s decay.\nLet the *San Guang* rush by—\nSun, moon, and stars—\nWhile the *Four Great Elements* bear the weight of forests and streams.\n\nBy the deep ravine, beside the secluded cliff,\nMountains hide, clouds seal the path.\nDisaster?\nThunder crashes, lightning strikes—\nYet none dare near me.\n\nAt noon, I rise and wander, then sit again.\nShatter every old habit.\nIn leisure’s embrace, only this remains:\nTired of greed, content in poverty,\nDesire severed, drowsy in the smoke of life.\nNo stored grain, no elixir sold.\nSinging with ease, laughing without restraint—\nWorthy indeed.\n\n---\n\n**Qiu Changchun #4**\nA lone wanderer, stumbling along,\nCrosses the Qin Basin—westward into the land of Panshu’s winding streams.\nBy empty valleys, cliffs, and secluded ravines,\nA lofty cave in the clouds shelters his trace.\n\nSmoke and flame are nonexistent,\nNo provisions stored—what need has he ever amassed?\nHunger met, thirst quenched,\nHe seeks sustenance in village lanes and byways at each passing hour.\nWhatever scraps of cold or hot remain,\nFilling his belly, stuffing his gut,\nNo need for true *cultivation*’s force.\n\nLiking and disliking come and go—just enough to keep him alive,\nAvoiding the labor of kitchen and hearth.\nHis *skin-bag*#5 is mere guise,\nAs incense fills his *passages*#6—\nSeeking only to augment his *vital essence* and *qi*.\n\nHis physical form is light and nimble,\nHis *Dharma-body*#7 rests with ease.\n\n---\n\n**Qiu Changchun #5**\nIn the thatched hut, we sit together,\nLet the *Pure-Void*#8 and cold detachment\nStir the heart’s incense—warm as ever.\nHe knows the *Primordial True Face*—\nAll *dharma* dissolves into the same.\n\nWalking like idle clouds,\nSitting as empty valleys,\nMotion and stillness both rest.\n\nThe *Mystic Profound*’s subtlety—\nIndeed, it cannot be split open with words.\nGazing upward, the heights are boundless,\nPeering ahead, it vanishes in an instant—\nA single point, never lacking.\n\nWhether speech or silence,\nAll—*immortals*, *sages*, *Buddhas*—\nShare its perfect harmony.\n*Chan* and *Dao* alike:\nVoid, still, and utterly extinguished.\n\nFilling every measure, yet forgotten,\nSwelling the earth, yet unnoticed—\nWrapped in *Round Perfection*#9, clear and complete.\nThe *Mystic Sky* reveals itself alone—\nA wheel of formless *heart-moon*#10.\n\n---\n\n**Qiu Changchun #6**\nDelving into the *Mystic Profound* with toil,\nForcing through the *Dao-law*’s iron firmament.\nCawing crows, howling monkeys—\nAll speak of the *Non-Dual*#11.\nYet beware of clinging to their divisions.\n\nA single shout—*heart* is illuminated,\nA staff’s strike—*nature* is seen.\nThis truth is fixed, yet hard to say.\n\nThe knots of doubt are shattered,\nThe original face is light—its secrets spill.\nFlowers bloom on rootless trees,\nPulsing through ages, ancient and new,\nFalling away, returning to the *kalpa*#12.\n\nWiping the *brush* with tortoise-shell,\nRinsing the *mouth* with spring’s flow—\nLong-tongued as the *stone-washing*#13.\nFive schools of *dharma*, six lineages of *patriarchal intent*#14,\nYet all erect a waist-high snowdrift—\nA hollow display.\n\nLet me liken it to this:\nA jade pool, cold, steeped in autumn’s moon.\n---\n\n**Manting Huang** #15\n*Sinking into the Void*, yet clinging to stillness,\nThe fool wastes his labor in vain.\nGrinding bricks to make a mirror,\nSeeking fish by climbing trees.\nWhy point at the moon when it’s seen?\nTo gaze upon flowers—\nAll is *Suchness*#16.\n\nThe wise discern things as they arise,\nNeither vexed nor pleased.\nAs *immortal* or *Buddha*—\nNo gain, no loss,\nNeither real nor unreal.\n\nRadiant, open—\nA single *divine pearl*#17.\nMingling with the vulgar, yet never stained,\nAmid the crowd—\n*Dharma* and dust cannot bind him.\n\nThe *Everlasting Use*#18 knows no limits—\nStable, vast, and boundless.\nWhat is not *Void* and *Nothingness*?\n\n---\n\n**Zui Jiangyu** #19\n*Huangfu the True Person*#20\nPierces the *Chaos*#21—\nBehold! The *Qingbi*#22\nSouthward, the Yangtze’s jade-like grip.\n\nFrom ancient to modern, poets have sought its scenes—\nWho understands its *original source*?\n\nThe years pass, one *Geng* month follows another *Jia*—\nWhy does it show no difference?\nNow I reveal the *key*—\nTo know the origins of heaven and earth.\n\nThe *Dao* has a name that may be spoken—\nThe *Five Phases*#23 shift, overturning,\nArranging the *Heavenly Horse*#24 and *Earthly Tiger*#25’s strategies.\n\n*Kan* water flows backward to the *Bing* door#26,\nFollowing the moon’s waxing and waning, ebbing and swelling.\nAt *Mid-Autumn*, when *qi* arrives,\nMetal can birth water—\nSnow surges in layers a thousandfold.\nThe *immortals’* wondrous workings\nAre no different from the tides.\n\n---\n\n**Shui Diao Ge Tou** #27\n*Xu Jing, the Heavenly Master*#28\nHolds the *secret keys* of the *Highest Truth*#29,\nGuides the learned to rescue the lost.\nA pure heart, a spotless path—\nAll *heavenly beings*, *saints*, and *common folk* seek refuge here.\nNot in *soaring through the Pole Star* or *treading the Dipper*#30,\nNot in *broad hearing* or *much learning*—\nA chaotic mind only breeds doubt.\n\nOnly banish deceit and falsehood,\nLet the heart align with the *divine*#31.\nAwaken to the *True Void*#32,\nBreak free from the world’s snare,\nSever the *passages*#33.\n\nNurture vast *qi*#34,\nCommanding thunder, subduing lightning—\nRescuing the world from peril.\nMerge with all *spirits*, returning to the One,\nA single thought pierces heaven and earth—\nOnly then does *non-doing*#35 begin.\n\nWith a shout, winds and rains arise,\nUpholding the world, aiding the *rightful age*#36.\n\n---\n**#2**\nNo need to hunt for *divine waters*#37,\nNor ask of the *Pool of Flowers*#38.\nYellow sprouts, white snow—\nAll are but false names.\nJust these *Heavenly Ox* and *Earthly Horse*#39,\nAre the *High Dragon* and *Kan Tiger*#40—\nNo need for further guesswork.\n\nMedicines weigh no *jin* or *liang*#41,\n*Fire-alchemy*#42 need not be timed.\n\n**偃月炉，朱砂鼎，总皆非。**\nThe crescent furnace, the cinnabar cauldron—all in vain.\n\n**真铅真汞，遇之不炼要何为。**\nTrue lead and true mercury—if they meet unrefined, what purpose is there?\n\n**自己金翁姹女，渐渐打成一块，胎息象婴儿。**\nThe Golden Uncle and Crimson Maiden, fused together—\nBreathing as one, like an infant in the womb.\n\n**不信张平叔，你更问他谁。**\nDo not trust Zhang Ping-shu—who else would you ask?\n\n---\n\n**其三#9**\n*(Attributed to Bai Yu-xian)*\n\n**东风卷帘模，时物又新奇。**\nThe east wind lifts the curtain—spring’s wonders anew.\n\n**桃花院落，小桥流水柳依依。**\nPeach blossoms in the courtyard, willows clinging to the bridge,\nWhere streams flow softly beneath.\n\n**正是清明天气，芳草池塘鲜丽，何处不相宜。**\nAt Qingming’s gentle season, fragrant grasses brighten the ponds—\nWherever one lingers, all is fitting.\n\n**紫燕添新垒，小雨洒芳菲。**\nSwallows build their nests in purple hues,\nWhile fine rain scatters blossoms’ splendor.\n\n**老生涯，沽酒杖，钓鱼矶。**\nIn my old age, I drink wine with a staff,\nOr fish from the rocks where the river bends.\n\n**江湖一样，几声鸥鹭夕阳微。**\nLakes and rivers alike—\nA few cries of herons as the sun sinks low.\n\n**百岁光阴石火，万迭云山烟锁，回首顿忘机。**\nA hundred years pass like flint and fire,\nEndless peaks shrouded in mist—\nTurning back, all worldly schemes dissolve.\n\n**蝶梦松窗下，高卧碧云蹊。**\nButterfly dreams beneath the pine window,\nSlumbering deep in the path of azure clouds.\n\n---\n\n**孤鹰**\n*(Ma Dan-yang)*\n\n**苦海为人，随波逐浪，茫茫甚日休期。**\nAs a man in the bitter sea, tossed by waves,\nWhen will this endless drifting cease?\n\n**为酒色财气，一向粘惹，瞒心昧己。**\nFor wine and lust, wealth and arrogance—\nClinging like stains, deceiving the heart and self.\n\n**不算前程，幻躯有限，待作千年之计。**\nNo reckoning of fate—this mortal form is fleeting,\nYet men scheme for millennia ahead.\n\n**忽一朝阴公来请，看你教谁替。**\nSuddenly, the Dark Lord summons—\nWho then will you send in your place?\n\n**千间峻宇，金玉满堂，毕竟成何济。**\nA thousand rooms of towering halls,\nGold and jade piled high—\nWhat good does it all bring in the end?\n\n**劝诸公省，早把凡笼猛跳出。**\nI urge you, gentlemen, to wake—\nBreak free from the cage of mundane desires!\n\n**向物外飘蓬，放落魄婪耽，鹑居鷇食，昏昏炼己。**\nBeyond the world’s clamor, like a drifting leaf,\nCast off greed and folly—\nLive like the quail in its nest, eating plain fare,\nRefining the self in quietude.\n\n**默默地、怡神养气，丹成既济。**\nSilently, nurturing spirit and *qi*,\nThe elixir perfected—all is fulfilled.\n\n**乘彩云，跨凤归。**\nRiding the rainbow clouds, mounting the phoenix—\nReturning home.\n\n---\n\n**集贤宾**\n*(Wang Chong-chang)*\n\n**仔细曾穷究，想六地众生，强揽闲愁。**\nCarefully examining, I see the six realms’ beings—\nHow they force upon themselves idle sorrows.\n\n**恰才得食饱，又思量、骏马轻裘。**\nScarcely sated, they already scheme for\nFine horses and light furs.\n\n**有骏马，有轻裘，又思量、建节封侯。**\nWith swift steeds and warm cloaks,\nThey dream of banners and noble titles.\n\n**假若金银过北斗，置下万顷良田，盖起百尺高楼。**\nIf gold and silver fill the Dipper’s measure,\nIf they own vast fields and towering halls—\nWhat then?\n\n**儿孙自有儿孙福，莫与儿孙作马牛。**\nTheir children will have their own fortunes—\nDo not become their ox or horse.\n\n**贪利禄，竞虚名，惹机勾。**\nGreed for gain and hollow fame\nStirs the snares of fate.\n\n**岂知身似，水上浮沤。**\nDo they not see their bodies as\nFloating reeds on the water?\n\n**贪恋气财并酒色，不肯上、钓鱼舟。**\nClinging to *qi*, wealth, wine, and lust,\nThey refuse to board the fishing boat—\nThe path to true liberation.\n\n**荒尽丹田三顷，荆棘多稠。**\nThe *elixir field* lies waste, overgrown with thorns.\n\n**宝藏库、偷盗了明珠，铁灯盏、渗漏了清油。**\nThe treasure vault is plundered of its pearls,\nThe iron lamp leaks its pure oil.\n\n**水银迸散难再收，大丹砂甚日成就。**\nMercury scatters, never to be gathered—\nWhen will the Great Elixir be complete?\n\n**杀曾叮咛劝，劝着后，几曾偢。**\nThough warnings are whispered again and again,\nHow few heed them!\n\n**苦海深，波浪流。**\nThe bitter sea runs deep, its waves endless.\n\n**心闲无事却垂钩。**\nWith a tranquil heart, the fishing line is cast—\nNo need for haste.\n\n**呜呼锦鳞终不省，摇头摆尾，恣纵来，来往戏波流。**\nAlas, the scaled treasures never awaken—\nShaking their heads, they frolic in the waves,\nUnwilling to be caught.\n\n**愚迷子，省贪求。**\nFoolish and lost, they cling to desire—\nAll for a needle’s worth of fame and gain,\nWhile youth fades unnoticed.\n\n---\n\n**齐天乐**\n*(Qiu Chang-chun)*\n\n**自离东海上，元本三州，四人同契。**\nSince leaving the Eastern Sea,\nThe Four Worthies of Shu—\nBound by the same Dao.\n\n**异域殊乡，同行并坐，终日相将游戏。**\nThough lands and homes were distant,\nWe walked and sat together,\nPlaying and conversing all day.\n\n**谈玄论妙，究方外之清闲，道家真味。**\nDiscussing the Mysterious and the Marvelous,\nProbing the leisure of the *outer world*,\nTasting the true essence of the Dao.\n\n**唱和从容，一师#10法眷情何异。**\nIn harmonious exchange, effortless as water,\nThe Master’s teachings—\nWhat difference is there in affection?\n\n**于今分显迥然，苦志勤心，磨炼各逃倾逝。**\nNow separated by vast distances,\nWith steadfast resolve and diligent hearts,\nEach refines himself, fleeing the world’s decline.\n\n**既是飘零，难为会合，幽僻关山迢递。**\nThough scattered like fallen leaves,\nGatherings are rare—\nRemote peaks and passes stretch endlessly.\n\n**乾坤间隔，望落落犹如，晓星之势。**\nHeaven and Earth divide us,\nLike scattered stars at dawn—\nDistant, yet visible.\n\n**再遇何年，驾云朝上帝。**\nWhen next we meet, in what year?\nRiding the clouds to pay homage to the Celestial.\n\n---\n\n**其二**\n**自清都别后，来人间梦中游戏。**\nSince parting from Qingdu,\nI wander in the world as in a dream.\n\n**性本玄虚，君临社稷，洪福齐天康济。**\nBy nature, I am boundless and void,\nYet rule the realm with boundless virtue—\nMy blessings match Heaven’s, bringing peace.\n\n**冬温夏清，任春水秋山，放怀如意。**\nIn winter, warmth; in summer, cool—\nSpring waters and autumn mountains at my will,\nMy heart unbound.\n\n**外物多情，幻身无奈生憔悴。**\nThough the world is full of allure,\nThis mortal form grows weary in vain.\n\n**深穷仙方道术，固炼形神，内观返调元气。**\nI delve deeply into immortal arts,\nCultivating body and spirit,\nTurning *qi* inward, restoring its roots.\n\n**四大冲和，三彭遁匿，熟境繁华何忌。**\nThe Four Elements harmonize,\nThe Three *Peng*s retreat—\nWhat need to fear the world’s luxuries?\n\n**真空妙有，况千古灵明，自然凋弊。**\nTrue Void, wondrous existence—\nHow much more so the ancient *Ling-ming*,\nWhich fades of its own accord.\n\n**梦觉心开，廓然超万岁。**\nAwakening from the dream, the heart expands—\nTranscending ten thousand years.\n\n---\n\n**永遇乐**\n**试问诸公，本来模样，如何形状。**\nGentlemen, let me ask—\nWhat is your original form?\nHow does it appear?\n\n**纵使丹青，难描这个，旷劫端严相。**\nEven the finest brushes cannot capture it—\nIts grandeur spans eons.\n\n**无形无影，观之不见，听之又无响。**\nFormless, shadowless—\nYou cannot see it, nor hear its sound.\n\n**露堂堂、不摇不动，目前甚是明朗。**\nYet it stands revealed, unmoving, unshaken—\nBright as day before you.\n\n**人还省悟，回光返照，莫向外边劳攘。**\nIf only men would awaken,\nTurning inward like the sun’s last light—\nDo not toil beyond!\n\n**放下诸缘，屏除万事，物物离心上。**\nCast aside all attachments,\nSet aside all worldly affairs—\nLet all things drift free from the mind.\n\n**迷云消散，性天独露，心月永无遮障。**\nThe clouds of delusion disperse,\nRevealing the true nature—\nThe heart’s moon, unobstructed forever.\n\n**与三界、一切诸仙，并无两样。**\nIt shares no difference with the Three Realms,\nOr all the immortals.\n\n---\n\n**其二**\n**行也无忧，坐也无闷，长安长乐。**\nWalking brings no worry, sitting no restlessness—\nEternal peace in Chang’an.\n\n**息息绵绵，朝朝暮暮，保养神珠一颗。**\nBreath by breath, day by day,\nNurturing the precious *shen-zhu* within.\n\n**闲是闲非，莫偢莫采，大忌竞争人我。**\nLeisure is not leisure—\nDo not strive, do not grasp—\nThe greatest taboo is competing with others.\n\n**灭无明、心似寒灰，便是道人功果。**\nExtinguish ignorance—\nThe heart like cold ashes—\nThis is the Daoist’s reward.\n\n**猿儿不走，马儿捉住，龙虎定中交媾。**\nThe monkey does not flee,\nThe horse is caught—\nThe union of Dragon and Tiger is sealed.\n\n**阳降阴升，日来月往，炉炼长生药。**\nYang descends, Yin ascends,\nSun and moon pass—\nThe furnace refines the elixir of longevity.\n\n**抽添鼎内，不须炊爨，自有九阳真火。**\nStirring within the cauldron,\nNo need for stoking—\nThe Nine Suns’ true fire burns on its own.\n\n**霜心子、明把天机，与君说破。**\nFrosted Heart—\nI reveal the Heavenly Mystery to you.\n\n---\n\n**宣静三台**\n*(Niu Zhen-ren)*\n\n**自小飘蓬，身心落魄，云游多在山东。**\nFrom youth, a drifting leaf,\nBody and heart adrift—\nMostly wandering in Shandong’s mountains.\n\n**世间事，看破浑是假想，荣华犹似梦中。**\nThe world’s affairs—\nAll illusions, seen through—\nGlory and splendor like a fleeting dream.\n\n**盖个庵儿，隈山靠水，栽松种竹成林。**\nI built a humble hut,\nNestled by mountains and water,\nPlanting pines and bamboo until the grove was thick.\n\n**炕暖窗明，乐清闲、胜竞利名。**\nThe kang is warm, the windows bright—\nJoy in quietude surpasses striving for fame.\n\n**月朗山东，凉风细细，南溪绿水邻邻。**\nUnder the bright moon in Shandong,\nCool breezes whisper,\nBeside the green waters of Nanxi.\n\n**Gradual Refinement**\n\nAs the elixir is refined,\nThe heart’s core grows cold as ash—\nYet one *yang* stirs,\nThe jade cauldron warms itself.\n\nEthereal *qi* swirls thick,\nCelestial blossoms bloom in splendor,\nFragrance fills the Yellow Court.\n\nJade Maidens and Golden Boys\nGather them—\nForging the Purple Gold.\n\nCirculating the Three Passes,\nDriving back the Four Symbols,\nHarmonizing the One Essence of Clarity.\n\n*Qi* condenses, spirit congeals—\nListen to the *sheng* and *xiao*,\nA symphony of pure sound.\n\nFated bonds from past lives,\nEncountering the True Teaching now—\nThe profound, perfect Dao.\n\nMerit fulfilled, the work complete,\nRiding *luan* and *he* to the Supreme Clarity.\n\n---\n**Ode to Wuyi (No. 11)**\n*Bai Yuzhen*\n\nIn days of old, at Qin’s time,\nOn a Mid-Autumn night in Wuyi’s Nine Bends—\nSilent mist,\nSlanted sun, mere spans in height,\nCrows perched on withered branches.\n\nThirty-six peaks stand in morning verdure,\nOne stream’s flow births autumn’s green.\nJust as the groves fill with cassia’s scent,\nGolden millet scatters from the sky.\n\nDivine guests arrive—\nThe Golden Elixir ripens.\nA jade edict descends,\nClouds form beneath my feet.\nNew bones knit in stone,\nYet still cling to red flesh.\n\nMidnight’s moon shines bright as day,\nThe Jade Emperor’s palanquin arrives, feasts spread.\nLaughing, I recall the pavilion’s past—\nNow only pines and bamboo remain.\n\n---\n**Ode to the White Lotus**\n\nLast night, Chang’e wandered,\nDrunk from the Celestial Palace’s halls.\nWhy did she drop her jade hairpin?\nThe Water Spirit stays silent.\n\nShe took it to the Crystal Palace—\nAt dawn, it was returned, chattering.\nThe wind blew it into fragrant skies—\nWho could distinguish?\n\nSoft yet moist,\nCool and pure.\nWhite as jade,\nCold as snow.\nEven the Jade Emperor’s gardens\nLack such a bloom.\n\nOnly poetry can praise it—\nLet none dare pluck or break it.\nLaughing at Li’s coarse lotus,\nThin as a willow—\nThis one surpasses all.\n\n---\n**Ten Thousand Springs**\n*Qiu Changchun*\n\nSleeves, autumn’s cloak—\nWearing them now feels just right.\nFrost-clear skies.\nUnfettered joy in wandering,\nNo fear of the west wind’s might.\n\nHundreds of petals, thousands of threads,\nStrung together with precision.\nLoose yet bound.\nWildness without, inner pearls gleaming.\n\n---\n**Playful Leisure**\n\nThe moon at heaven’s edge,\nAt first like a bow.\nNow vanished in the *geng* earth.\nDragons seek tigers,\nTigers seek dragons—\nThey meet.\nA golden flower blooms in the wind.\n\nThe moon at heaven’s edge,\nNow like an overturned furnace.\nLead and mercury dwell in the alchemical tripod.\nFire must refine,\nMelting the flowing pearl.\nOne gourd—\nThree hundred eighty-four *zhu*.\n\n---\n**Pearl Curtain**\n*Bai Yuzhen*\n\n*Yin* and *yang* internally unite,\nLead and mercury arrayed in the Eight Trigrams.\nThe Golden Cauldron refines the Yellow Sprout,\nAt the hour when *yang* first ascends.\nAfter the Hour of Child, before noon—\nFire enters the jade furnace,\nBoiling into white snow.\n\nPiercing clarity.\nThis Mysterious Pass is profound—\nNot lightly revealed.\n\n**Following the Master’s Subtle Instructions**\n\nSeizing the essence of Tiger and Dragon,\nThe sun and moon arise naturally.\nHeaven’s creative art—how could mortals fathom?\nExchanging mortal bones,\nForever free from demonic snares.\n\nTranscending.\n\nGazing toward the Celestial Capital’s gate,\nBowing at the Golden Palace of the Primordial.\nDrunk on fragrant wine from youthful lone clouds,\nBeyond all worldly ties.\nWearing one patch,\nStitching another—\nThe joy of unbounded ease.\n\nA broken gourd at the waist,\nNo other baggage.\nOthers mock me for my lack of care.\nLet them point and scold.\nIn ancient temples and shrines,\nI play with mud gods instead.\n\nA cracked sand basin,\nA shattered clay pot,\nA spoon bent beyond use.\nA torn paper quilt,\nA mended sack,\nCurled up to sleep.\n\nOnly waiting—\nWhen my merit is complete, I’ll ascend to the Jade Emperor.\nThen shall I prove myself a true man of resolve.\n\n**Gazing at Penglai**\n*Qiu Changchun*\n\nHear my counsel, for small matters you must know:\nAll striving brings harm in the end—\nProfit gained is profit lost.\nCleverness is not as good as simplicity.\n\nTrue cultivation lies beyond the mind’s grasp.\nSee only what is before you,\nAnd troubles will not follow.\nStep by step, enter the realm of Non-Action.\n\n**Four Pieces of Jade**\n\nLife’s swift as a shuttle, so turn back soon to seek your livelihood.\nDo not let gain ensnare you, nor fame drag you—\nLet not wine and lust cloud your senses.\n\nRight and wrong, others and I—\nWhy stir the idle *qi*?\n\nWhen lead is spent and mercury exhausted,\nThen will you rue your hidden treasures—\nIn vain you’ll weep and wail.\n\nFrom this day forth, take action now,\nBetter early than delayed.\n\nBe simple, be foolish—\nProfit will come to you naturally.\n\nEven if you feed a thousand mouths at home,\nWhat good does it bring?\nIn vain you labor body and mind,\nDay and night without rest,\nWasting your youthful bloom,\nLeaving you gaunt and weary.\n\nWhy endure this suffering?\nWhy not look back and reflect:\nCount your own blessings—\nWho can replace the impermanence?\n\n**Cranes’ Lingering Echoes**\n*Volume II: Daoist Wanderings of Mount Xiangyou, by Monk Peng

meal, leisurely pacing,\nA staff in hand—what support for wild gazing?\nSails return to distant harbors,\nHerons stand on riverbanks,\nA thousand trees in blossom, softly unfurled.\nFragrant grasses by the pond,\nJade River towers—\nMisty clouds conceal the green barriers.\nGazing eastward to the horizon’s end,\nNo old friends—only melancholy.\nReturning homeward, the emerald ridges steep,\nForests and peaks in shadowed embrace,\nTo while away the evening’s restless mood.\nClever birds in whispered song,\nWillows droop like golden threads,\nGreen shadows echo on the bridge’s span.\nSweeping away serpentine cares,\nSavoring the breeze and light—\nLike Tao Qian and Xie Lingyun in verse and brush.\nWhat fine scenes these mountains hold,\nBeyond the world’s dust—\nHow few can truly seek them.\n\n**#2**\nThe sun’s last glow returns,\nAn end to mortal toil—\nWhere now shall I rest my weight?\nWithered fields of Zheng,\nBamboo groves and pine streams,\nWhere hidden joys and pleasures dwell.\nCloud-friends and mist-companions,\nWater’s hue, mountains’ grace—\nSecluded in smoke-wreathed crags and valleys.\nYet here, my spirit soars beyond the sky,\nA single breath of boundless vastness.\nWorthy of love:\nButterflies dance on blossoming branches,\nMoss creeps on stone paths,\nSoft winds lift the curtains—daylight high.\nWith serene breadth of mind,\nChewing the cosmos’ essence,\nLofty above the world’s clamor and feasts.\nLoose robes, wide sleeves,\nPale jade dangling—\nLaughing, I recline by the eastern hedge, sipping wine.\nI would write my true feelings,\nYet dusty paths and absent friends\nLeave only desolation.\n\n**#3**\nPiercing the world’s delusion,\nFree of mortal snares—\nDrifting, unbound, no chains to hold.\nFloating like water-plants,\nRefined in solitude, proud as wild deer,\nLike clouds and deer in untamed lands.\nRiding waves when struck by fate,\nBlending with the world’s light—\nWhat honor or shame in knowing when to stop?\nLet the tides of life surge on,\nHeedless of youth’s fleeting rush.\nFrom now on, ink and brush gather dust,\nWorldly thoughts dissolve—\nContent in emerald clouds’ high halls.\nAll things released,\nAll cares abandoned—\nQuiet before my study’s plum and bamboo.\nPure laziness, ancient virtue’s wind,\nIs the true, eternal bliss.\nLet the crowd’s frenzy—\nDay and night, racing through the world’s paths,\nClashing like wild beasts—\nPass me by.\n\n**#4**\nDreaming of the Hall of Huai,\nLeaning against heaven’s heights, a long cry—\nPiercing through the world’s illusions, past and present.\nCarrying twin mirrors bright as snow,\nHunting tigers, slaying dragons—\nOnce, I wasted my youth in such folly.\nJin Valley’s splendor,\nHan gardens, Qin palaces—\nOnly fallen petals and drifting silk remain.\nAh, mortal life—\nBusy all day, who pauses to reflect before death?\nBetter than this:\nPure talk with jade dust,\nGolden zithers’ refined play—\nSleeping high in the caverns’ threshold.\nRoaming fields at ease,\nFreeing my heart’s wild flight,\nLeisurely with lapwing and heron by the marsh.\nGathering my life anew,\nPurple crabs, golden oranges—\nA single raincoat on the misty river.\nDrunk, I return as always,\nTo the deep reeds’ embrace,\nMoonlight on the quiet shore.\n\n**#5**\nAsk the Zen gates—\nEndless seeking, often empty at the end.\nGrinding bricks to make a mirror,\nPiling snow for beams—\nHow many youths have wandered lost?\nSwallowing mountains,\nNestling mustard seeds—\nLaughing gold-headed adepts.\nWhen enlightened, transcending the Ten Bhūmis,\nFree from doubt in the Four Births and Six Paths.\nWho hears the cuckoo’s cry at dawn\nBefore the cliff’s silent rocks,\nBeneath the shade-less tree?\nThe path to Caoxi is steep,\nThe Eagle’s Ridge shrouded in clouds—\nNo trace of old friends here.\nA thousand-foot ice cliff,\nFive-petaled lotuses bloom,\nAncient halls’ scented curtains sway.\nAvoiding the brambles’ tangle,\nOld wives and wandering sons—\nDream and reality blur.\n\n**#6**\nTo transcend and attain the True,\nSteel your resolve—\nAwaken wisdom suddenly.\nDust dispelled, thoughts still,\nLove abandoned, sorrow forgotten—\nTranquil ease knows its own sweetness.\nA thunderclap—\nFire ignites the Three Fields,\nMidnight crows fly a thousand *li*.\nThrough the curtains, the furnace glows warm,\nDrinking elixir’s rich, fragrant nectar.\nNow skilled in hand:\nRiding phoenixes, mounting cranes,\nForging gold, refining wood—\nReveling in the caverns’ marvels.\nRadiant light, pure essence,\nFilling sea and mountain—\nTrue *qi* permeates heaven and earth.\nStriding on wind and cloud,\nMounting sun and moon,\nNo child’s play, this mastery.\nGathering the Mystic Pearl,\nReturning to the Great Void—\nSaints and sages share this realm.\n\n**#7**\nThe Dao is profound and hidden—\nHow can its signs be known?\nSpeak of it, and even ghosts and gods recoil in dread.\n\nIt embraces the cosmos,\nSplits the Mysterious Origin,\nTrue joy in the world has no equal.\n\nBefore the Spirit Vulture Peak,\nA treasure pearl is plucked forth—\nFive radiant hues shine clear.\n\nIlluminating heaven and earth,\nAll beings above and below—\nThe wise live as long as mountains and seas.\n\nAt its utmost height,\nEmerald mists dissolve lightly,\nJade flowers fall in disarray,\nAn empty void weaves into a canopy.\n\nGolden body, jade bones,\nMoonly veil, starry crown,\nIn harmony with crystal and celestial resonance.\n\nPure and serene abode,\nSaints and sages’ bearing—\nThrough ages, their presence remains.\n\nMay those who seek\nGrasp this subtle, rare truth,\nTogether wander beyond the square.\n\n---\n\n**#8**\nTo avoid the world and dwell in peace,\nMingle with dust yet stay aligned,\nSilent depths—who can know the sage?\n\nDwelling like quails, eating like sparrows,\nMoss paths, vine-lined caves,\nNurturing virtue in profound stillness.\n\nFloating stillness has its place,\nEmerging and retreating without measure,\nDivine responsiveness defies prediction.\n\nDelight in gourd and bowl,\nLaugh in scorn of groves and springs,\nYet refuse to bow to servitude.\n\nAt this moment,\nPine chairs, bamboo halls—\nLips hum, tongue plucks,\nDrinking spring wine from jade cups.\n\nA chestful of moonlight,\nTwo sleeves of clean wind—\nTruly, this is the hidden truth.\n\nThe life beyond the square,\nMeaning in stillness,\nNot to be casually plucked.\n\nWait for the mist to disperse,\nThe jade cord to rise pure—\nThen know the truth itself.\n\n---\n\n**#9**\nAh, the masses’ delusion,\nLost in the ford’s twists,\nWhen will their drifting cease?\n\nStriving for supremacy,\nClinging to life in vain,\nEver bound to home and gain.\n\nChains of profit, reins of fame,\nWaves of desire, mountains of favor,\nDrunk in the wine markets, stumbling through flower-lined streets.\n\nLike ants in endless cycles,\nThey forget their hair turns white.\nWho would choose the Great Simplicity’s grove,\nThe land of Non-Action,\nTo idle with Laozi and Zhuangzi?\n\nPearls lost, elephants trapped in nets,\nDreaming shattered in Hua Xu,\nHigh-pillowed in the celestial caverns of day and moon.\n\nThe Three Realms vanish,\nThe Eight Directions dissolve into emptiness—\nPiercing, luminous light shines through.\n\nThis effortless freedom beyond kalpas,\nAh, true joy—\nWords cannot say it.\n\n---\n\n**#10**\nTime flees like a crack in a wheel,\nLike dust motes—\nSilently shifting all things.\n\nThe floating life is restless,\nAwareness lost in dust,\nEntangled by wine, desire, profit, fame.\n\nLook, through the ages,\nHeroes of Chu, Yue, Zhou, Qin, Tang, Han—\nOnly crumbling graves and ruined steles remain,\nEndless strife through the ages.\n\nYet those who awaken early\nFind in the jade cup’s blue-green depths,\nWhite clouds piled—\nAnother palace of emerald mists.\n\nThe Three Heavens’ gathering,\nFive-colored lights converge,\nMorning attendance at the jade banquet of Purple Micro.\n\nThe Celestial Gardens, the Jade Pool,\nThe Vermilion Gate, the Pure Capital—\nTruly, this is effortless wandering.\n\nLaughing at the foolish,\nTrapped in the苦海, selling bones without end,\nEndlessly turning.\n\n---\n\n**#11**\nAwakened at Caoqi,\nCranes soar into the celestial void,\nCloud-water monks’ livelihood.\n\nBy the river, raising the oar,\nFacing the scene, casting the hook—\nRed carp leap from the brocade waves.\n\nWind carries the fishing boat,\nPiercing twin peaks,\nShadows wrapped—startled clarity after rain.\n\nSeeing mist and clouds,\nGazing at the elixir’s gold—\nOne grain surpasses all treasures.\n\nIn its mystery,\nThe Great One contains the True,\nThe Mysterious Origin forms its image,\nAscending and descending without obstruction.\n\nNine years of resolve,\nThree years of will,\nFive flowers of jade nectar refined.\n\nAll from the numinous source,\nPiercing the Nine Lights,\nThe true realm revealed beyond compare.\n\nThis eternal life, prolonged vision,\nHeaven’s profound mechanism,\nThe true logic of immortals.\n\n---\n\n**#12**\nEstablishing the numinous altar,\nFirst refining the elixir furnace,\nNurturing the True Vitality of Great Harmony.\n\nWind howls, tigers roar,\nFire rises, dragons ascend—\nHarmonizing depends on the seasons.\n\nMetal and wood converge,\nThe Dipper’s axis aligns with Heaven’s Gate,\nSwirling to purge the heart’s path.\n\nWitness the Mystic Pearl—\nA grain of flowing wine,\nFlickering back into the golden cauldron.\n\nThe cauldron’s scene—\nCreation’s subtle mystery,\nEssential patterns must be refined,\nCrafting the spirit’s essence, the soul’s sanctity.\n\nFrom nothingness to function,\nFrom principle to truth—\nAwakening to the original nature.\n\nReturning to boundlessness,\nGradually entering Green Yang,\nThe仙境 fills the void with

creation,\nForging one perfect pill.\n\nFollowing Yin and Yang’s divine use,\nNurturing the boundless true breath.\n\nAt the Mystic Pass’s awakening,\nOnly now do the blind and deaf see—\nEncountering the sage who opens the way.\n\nUsing talismans of wondrous Dao,\nSilently moving subtle patterns,\nJade nectar flows, increasing.\n\nCloud-water leisure,\nThe Great Void’s emptiness—\nVastness has no trace.\n\nThis elixir’s secret,\nA lifetime’s doubt—\nNow dissolved like ice.\n\n---\n\n**#14**\nSun and moon race high,\nGolden waves surge—\nSeven returns, nine circulations extend life.\n\nTrue essence responds to things,\nThe Dao hides its body,\nMysteriously penetrating the path.\n\nOnly when Yang arises,\nDoes creation’s elixir form—\nDragon and Tiger ascend to Purple Void’s heaven.\n\nThis jade case,\nCelestial seals of fate—\nMust be opened by the sage.\n\nThe Way of longevity,\nDeep-rooted and firm,\nThe immortals’ craft—\nRefining lead and mercury as their duty.\n\nThe furnace glows with five colors,\nThe cauldron radiates the Three Lights—\nRecognize the original True Ancestor.\n\nBefore the Moonlit Pavilion,\nA golden cicada appears,\nDancing on emerald peaks in bright space.\n\nWith a lofty resolve,\nSincere cultivation,\nThe immortal’s examination.\n\n---\n\n**#15**\nOriginal qi fills the cauldron,\nRagged robes conceal the body—\nWhat use

breath returns to primordial essence.\n\n「Ranging through the Eight Boundaries,\nWandering in praise of the Three Mountains,\nNever straying far—all within arm’s reach.\n\nLamentable are those lost in error,\nHow could they know the interplay of Yin and Yang?\nThe True Ancestor’s teachings are left to false demons.\n\nRefining the Golden Elixir—\nAll are born of Heaven and Earth’s finest,\nVying in bold and boundless *qi*.\n\n---\n**Sixteen**\nWithdrawing from grains, halting the kitchen,\nFeasting on mist and drinking dew,\nReturning to nature’s unforced harmony.\n\nLead sprouts five

auspicious clouds.\n\n**[Pulling lightning through the void]**\nSpeaking of the Three Corpses fleeing,\nSix Thieves scattering in terror.\n\nRevealing the Daoist embryo’s flight,\nFive clouds swirling,\nHarmonious sounds rising in chorus.\n\n---**Twenty**---\n\n---\n\n**Nine**\nTo brave snow and frost, to meet wind and rain,\nTo greet the breeze and bathe in the mist—\nA rare chance to find the Sage and gain enlightenment.\nTo grasp the subtle, enter the marvelous,\nRevive the dead, restore life—\nThis is the Daoist standard for elixir cultivation.\n\nYin and Yang in

splendor—\nThe True Landscape, emerald and vivid, stands revealed.\n\nBeholding the Heart’s clarity like a moonlit dawn,\nCool winds sweeping the horizon,\nThe Celestial Cavern bright and open.\n\n**[The *Peaceful Return* and *Rebirth of the Sage* Suites]**\nLaughing at my humble self,\nOrdinary passions I’ve cast aside,\nLightly abandoning my old fishing by the cliff’s edge.\n\nGalloping through Chang’an,\nListening to the oriole’s song in the imperial gardens,\nYet in vain did I squander my youth in Luoyang.\n\nAt the Jade Hall, summons are issued,\nBeside the Golden Throne, I join the feasts,\nRepeatedly receiving imperial edicts on elixir refinement.\n\nIn what year did I dream beneath the huai tree,\nStill clad in my humble raincoat by the Jiang River’s banks?\nHeaven bestows upon me\nEndless layers of cloud screens, the Five Lakes’ misty waves,\nWild monkeys and sand cranes—\nBoundless wilderness, untamed.\n\nAt dawn, the Purple Pavilion,\nBy dusk, the Mysterious Isle,\nMy hair drying in the crimson mist of the forest’s edge.\n\nThe Azure Dragon leaps from the sea,\nThe White Crane ascends to the heavens—\nIn a single instant, all is fulfilled.\n\nGazing toward the Pure Celestial Court,\nThe crisp autumn winds and dews,\nThe Celestial Cavern’s first light.\n\n---\n\n**Twenty**\nA quiet chamber to cultivate the heart,\nMountains and clouds to nurture the Dao—\nNearly encountering the Sage to receive the secret precepts.\n\nThe furnace stacked with the Eight Trigrams,\nThe cauldron prepared with the Three Talismans,\nBuilding the foundation of Daoist practice.\n\nYin and Yang aligned,\nTurning the cosmic pivot,\nThe Dragon and Tiger coiling in endless dance.\n\nThis celestial mechanism—\nIts inverse and direct—\nThe scholarly currents do not comprehend.\nHow could one distinguish its true nature?\n\nThe logic of the Luminous and the Obscure—\nAuspicious *qi* billowing, blessed clouds gathering,\nPurple vapors enveloping the golden palaces.\n\nThousands of deities assembled,\nTen thousand transformations complete,\nThen the Great Elixir is ripe.\n\nThe *qi*-tree and jade flowers,\nFilling the void with their splendor—\nThe True Vision, emerald and resplendent, stands in array.\n\nGazing upon the Heart’s clarity like the moon’s bright reflection,\nCool breezes sweeping the eye,\nThe Celestial Cavern’s light piercing through.\n\n---\n\n**Second Suite**\nSweeping away winds and clouds,\nParting the dust like silk,\nI’ve settled upon half a hill to hide my flaws.\n\nA green pine as my shelter,\nWhite stones as my bed—\nAll worldly cares now rest.\n\nHow many times have I visited Penglai,\nWearing a coarse robe, wielding a long sword,\nLeisurely facing the waves’ serene clarity?\n\nWhose home is this,\nWhere the wine is aged in the Immortal’s gourd,\nInviting me to share the bright moon’s gaze?\n\nReturning now—\nThe Jade Palace vast and empty,\nThe Silver River stark and cold,\nA single iron flute’s note splitting the mountain.\n\nThe Three *Hua* [1] encircle me in splendor,\nThe Nine *Qi* [2] weave like a net—\nLofty and ethereal, the Pure Celestial Gate.\n\nHolding the *Fu Rong* [3] in hand,\nAscending the void in flying steps,\nTonight, how many will pay homage?\n\nThen I turn—\nThe Northern Dipper as my ladle,\nScattering fragrant wine and snow across the purple cups.\n\n---\n\n**Third Suite**\nWhen the mountain moon arrives,\nThe sea wind stirs not,\nA jade tower and pavilion rise upon the plain.\n\nThe cassia’s fragrance drifts,\nThe dew’s luster like water,\nI pluck the Celestial Flute, its notes delicate as silk.\n\nFaint and distant, clear and distinct,\nThe Green Tortoise [4] transmits its sweet words.\n\nWithin the *Tai Wei* [5],\nThe *luan* [6] and crane seek each other—\nAll are old companions of the True Dao.\n\nHear now,\nThe Leopard’s Gate locked in layers,\nThe thunderous drums of a thousand officials,\nThe Celestial Realm’s endless courts.\n\nThe Stone Maiden pins her flowers,\nThe Wooden Man pours the wine—\nLet me dwell here for a while.\n\nSinging in lofty verses,\nWielding the brush with boundless strokes,\nThe dusty world is but trifles of past and present.\n\nLook upon the Spring Mountain,\nAll in verdant green—\nWhy does it mock the broken clouds and lingering rain?\n\n---\n\n**Fourth Suite**\nThe moon’s brilliance, the frost’s chill,\nMy fishing boat like a leaf—\nLeisurely crossing the clear, blue stream.\n\nThe Milky Way silent,\nThe jade rainbow arching over the wilds,\nThe Dipper’s handle now pointing north.\n\nHalf a black hat,\nA few strands of white hair,\nA single glance at the wild cranes in flight.\n\nAsk of the returning Sage,\nThe old trees of the southern city—\nHow many have they seen of past and present?\n\nAt the Western Hua’s peak,\nA flower ten *zhang* high,\nAutumnal dew from the Nine Heavens,\nForming emerald chambers and jade fruits.\n\nTo cast off my shoes is no hardship,\nAscending the void—how distant?\nThree gulps, and the snow melts into ice *qi*.\n\nThe *Divine Method of Abstaining from Grain*,\nThe *True Precept of Feasting on Clouds*—\nOnce gone, no trace remains.\n\nLaughing at the world’s dwellers,\nLong abiding in the void,\nWho compares to a single wheel of red sun?\n\n---\n\n**Fifth Suite**\nLoosening my oars in the boundless waves,\nThe setting sun’s last rays on the fallen clouds,\nI lean upon the shore as the mountain turns.\n\nRiding the wild geese, the double ducks,\nCutting through the reeds, drifting on the willows—\nMy body in a painted autumn scene.\n\nThe rain carries the sound of the shallows,\nThe wind shakes the candle’s shadow,\nMidnight still finds me reciting my scroll.\n\nCounting my parting emotions,\nWhy must they stretch to the heavens?\nA mere step’s distance, yet the path is long, and people are far.\n\nLaughing at myself alone,\nThe scholar from Luoyang,\nThe aged man of Xiangyang—\nHow often have they dreamed of me?\n\nOld now at the Floating Mound,\nComposing poetry beneath the bright moon,\nA thousand *ren* [7] of verdant sky and sharp blade.\n\nAfter the snow clears, the jade towers,\nSpring blooms on the jade mats—\nLet me host a grand feast in my old mountain home.\n\nWaiting for the rooster’s crow,\nThe sun rising over Luo Fu,\nFlying across the waves’ shallow, clear depths.\n\n---\n\n**Sixth Suite**\nTo drink wine while songs are sung,\nWithout cares to be resolved—\nThis is the Daoist’s true bearing.\n\nA fine breeze passing through my ears,\nThe moon’s brilliance filling my chest,\nThe pure sounds of water and mountain hues.\n\nA thousand years in the world,\nSeven days in the mountains—\nI’ve grown accustomed to wandering as a guest.\n\nAcross the void,\nThe Northern Dipper and Southern Star—\nWho could ever truly grasp this?\n\nOnce I recalled,\nThe blue-eyed barbarian monk,\nIn a coarse robe by the boundless sea,\nLowering his fishing line a thousand *chi* deep.\n\nPulling up a whale,\nThe wind and thunder transforming—\nNot a common marvel.\n\nCold and heat urging each other,\nHeaven and Earth no longer needed,\nThrough countless kalpas, never stale with time.\n\nAlas, my life—\nForgetting my lofty years,\nLong accompanying children’s games and plays.\n\n---\n\n**Seventh Suite**\nRemembering the Sage of the Slope,\nNightly wandering at the Red Cliff,\nA lone crane skimming past my boat to the west.\n\nThe heroes have all faded,\nMy life and fate now obscure—\nThe moon is small, the waters cold, the stars vast.\n\nHow like the fisherman,\nUnknowing of past and present,\nDrunk beside the water plant and firefly.\n\nIn dreams we meet—\nFeathers fluttering, robes swaying,\nNot necessarily this moment, not I alone.\n\nWho understands the Dao?\nAt the year’s end, the river is empty—\nThe wind’s force, the moon’s might,\nCrossing spears and composing verse by the Jiang River’s left bank.\n\nThe evening dew on my garments,\nThe late wind at the isles,\nHow many short poems and long odes have I penned?\n\nThe Jade Palace’s lofty chill,\nWhere are my old friends now?\nVast and distant, my heart knows no rest.\n\nI sigh at the journey,\nSailing the sea in a frail boat,\nMy followers not knowing who might accompany me.\n\n---\n\n**Eighth Suite**\nReturning now—\nYesterday’s folly, today’s truth,\nSadness alone, my words in vain.\n\nMy path lost is not far,\nMorning light soft and warm—\nI command my guide to lead the way.\n\nThe wind lifts my light boat,\nChildren at the gate,\nThis day I behold my humble home.\n\nWine fills the cups—\nThough the three paths are overgrown,\nThe pine and chrysanthemum still stand as before.\n\nI’ll leave my arrogance,\nDefying the world’s ways,\nOld friends all forgotten—\nWhere else shall I ride my boat to?\n\n---\n[1] *Hua* (花) – Refers to the three *Hua* (flower-like formations) of *qi* in Daoist alchemy.\n[2] *Qi* (氣) –

What was wrong is now right—\nAlone, I sigh in sorrow, speechless with grief.\nThe lost path is not far; dawn’s light glows bright,\nAnd I command my guide to lead the way ahead.\n\nA breeze lifts my light boat, children at the gate,\nToday I gaze upon my humble home once more.\nThough wine fills the cup and paths lie wild with time,\nThe pine and chrysanthemum stand as they were before.\n\nI take my pride in defiance of the world,\nForgot my old friends—where shall I ride my boat to now?\n\n---\n\n**其九**\nStrings and books, whispered words, seeking valleys and hills,\nThe weary crow perches where clouds and mist conspire.\nThe farmer tells me, “There’s work in the western fields,”\nAnd I set forth alone, penning verse in spring’s rain.\n\nBut I take joy in Heaven’s decree—what need to doubt\nThe unfolding of Nature’s will? Let it come and go.\n\nTen years on the Jiang, ten years on Yan Mountain,\nAccustomed to half a life of wind and snow.\nFacing snow without a boat, drifting without snow,\nNo chance to meet those pure and lofty in spirit.\n\nBroken shores, scattered sands—what night is this?\nLike returning to Ke Xi’s stream, bound for Yue.\n\nYet I lift the sail, and there—\nA few feet of plum blossoms, where human traces fade.\n\nDo you not see the Five Elders’ perilous peaks,\nFloating Master’s lofty summit, laughing at my early gray?\nTo reverse age, to refine the coarse into the subtle—\nI have only the Nine Returns’ elixir in vain.\n\nThe sun breaks through, the sky dazzles the sea,\nAnd all distinctions dissolve in oneness.\n\nThen I can proclaim—\nThe Six-Yi Immortal Sage, the eternal bright moon of the Void.\n\n---\n\n**其十**\nSixty years returned, now past seventy,\nGrateful for the Emperor’s grace and favor.\nEarly to bed, late to rise,\nDrinking when thirsty, eating when hungry—\nNo cares, no thoughts.\n\nA few volumes of tattered books,\nA half-broken inkstone—\nEnough for a scholar’s modest life.\n\nMaster Dao, write swiftly what I can recite—\nTruly, I am far from here.\n\nNo more pondering—\nJust lean on my green staff,\nWear my double-strapped sandals,\nAnd walk to the ferry to watch the water flow.\n\nThe past rushes by, the present comes in waves—\nUnmindful, the day grows late, the wind grows fine.\n\nA fisherman calls out suddenly—\n“What are you staring at?”\n\nThen he helps me carry fresh fish,\nAnd we drink together, drunk as one.\n\n---\n\n**十一**\nA path leads to the depths of mystery,\nA painted screen of emerald—\nWalking to where white clouds gather.\n\nPeaches of the world beyond, oranges by the well,\nA garden of rare mushrooms and elixir plants.\n\nLight taps on the *tan* board, the zither plays softly,\nOffering phoenix fat and lynx meat.\n\nDancing, my white hair drifts like the wind,\nStill like the old immortal companions.\n\nLook—\nPalaces of the gods, gold and jade in every hall,\nThis is the daily life of the *médhu* moth.\n\nFive-colored Penglai, the autumnal *diāo* bird,\nThere is another path to transcendence.\n\nWine ripens with Ma Gu, clouds rise from Wu Gorge,\nI bow to the Celestial Caverns and depart.\n\nLet the sea waves be clear and shallow—\nWhere is the green window, the cloudy door?\n\n---\n\n**十二**\nLight clouds, gentle winds,\nFollowing flowers and willows—\nAs if youth’s joys were still mine.\n\nHigh pavilions in the woods,\nA small carriage in the city—\nEternal peace in the Western Luo.\n\nBehold the vastness—\nSpeaking of the virtuous one,\nThe flowing water seems as it was yesterday.\n\nBut leisurely travels meet only light clouds at the sky’s edge,\nUncertain if sorrow or parting awaits.\n\nI remember well—\nAs a youth, we followed each other,\nBathing in Yi and returning,\nReciting as the swallows flew, the fish leaped.\n\nThe past rushes on—\nI am aging, yet I adjust my ways.\n\nThe *qín* strings hum in the sacred hall,\nThe old chamber’s bells and stones—\nHidden, I seem to hear them still.\n\nThe farmer tells me, “There’s work in the western fields,”\nAnd my books hang from the ox’s horns.\n\n---\n**满江红**\n*For Master Feng*\n\nSeasons hurry by—\nSuddenly, autumn’s message arrives.\nPast deeds rise—\nSo many triumphs and failures,\nA hundred years like a fleeting breath.\n\nThe scholar’s ambition unfulfilled,\nThe mountains early claimed my retreat.\nI sought the Five Lakes’ leisure, but Xiqi’s joy was rare—\nNo gain, no loss.\n\nHuman affairs—\nFull of sorrow and regret.\nThe world beyond—\nA different rhythm, a different grace.\n\nThis Penglai is serene and fair,\nJade halls, golden seals.\nBound by mortal cares, yet my heart is pure,\nMy spirit soars like the gods.\n\nSee the phoenix welcome me to the azure sky,\nThe clouds guide me home.\n\n---\n**其二**\nRain passes over the eastern suburbs,\nThe stream’s trace is shallow—\nSpring dawn in the mountain hall.\n\nWorthy of love—\nPeach blossoms in flowing water,\nLeisurely clouds, quiet crows.\n\nBeyond the world, the sun rises red,\nA single green hill at the world’s edge.\nToward the green shade, bamboo shadows roll the gate,\nForever settled.\n\nIn this quiet—\nWho knows?\n\nThe recluse of the world,\nRare in human company.\n\nLet me embrace wind and cup, moon and wine,\nDrunk on fragrant grass.\n\nGreat purpose contains the heavens and earth,\nTrue feeling stands firm in Xiqi’s depths.\nIn vain I send news to the forests and streams—\nOld in mist and clouds.\n\n---\n**其三**\nHigh sentiments through the ages\nLie in forests, streams, and winding rivers.\nKnowing this life is but a dream,\nWhy envy silk robes and grand halls?\n\nI love the moon’s reflection on the carved dock,\nThe sage does not envy gold mountains or jade.\nJoy fills the courtyard as flowers cast golden light,\nMoss stains the green.\n\nForever—\nThe east hedge’s chrysanthemum.\n\nA hollow-hearted staff,\nSouthern veranda bamboo.\nPillowed on books and *qín*, I sleep soundly,\nUnshamed, at ease.\n\nA thousand years of rise and fall—\nA spring dream awakens.\nOne stream of clouds and water—\nEnough for my life.\n\nLook at the Three Wuling Beauties,\nTheir fragrant breath.\nThe elixir fields are ripe.\n\n---\n**其四**\nMaster of the Eastern Village,\nWhere is your home—\nMountain shadows, winding streams?\n\n「其五」\nA mind at leisure,\nBright and open—\nThe Daoist’s heart, straight as heaven’s void.\nThough my body cannot yet rise weightless,\nI dwell in a humble *Daoist* dwelling.\n\nWithin my cup, I gaze and swallow the sun and moon,\nNot envying the world’s hoarded gold and jade.\nLet the fleeting years shift like *qi*’s illusion,\nScattering crimson and verdant hues.\n\nThe cinnabar well’s bloom—\nGolden chrysanthemums.\nThe *lingzhi* mushrooms, the *lángkān* bamboo.\n\nBefore the heartless wind’s carefree sway,\nWhat honor or shame remains?\n\nA hundred years of great dream drift beyond,\nAll worldly matters—\nA mind’s content.\n\nToward mortal realms, three times witness the Yellow River’s clarity,\nThe peach of immortality ripens.\n\n---\n**其六**\nA mind at leisure,\nThe *Hairy Skull Child*—\nEndless birth and death.\n\n「被化机，搬弄驰骋，许多颠蹙。」\nMastered by the subtle *qi* of transformation,\nSkillfully manipulated and unrestrained—\nEndless trials and tribulations.\n\nBuying bones like mountains—what purpose serves?\nLost in passion like the sea—how to transcend?\nGrief pierces the primal essence of things long buried in dust and ages.\nA *Dharma*’s cycle of suffering.\n\nTo seek liberation, one must be fierce.\nTo find true companions, speak of ice and snow.\nWith diligent effort and refinement,\nThe luminous *Dao* shines through.\n\nWhen winds cease and waves settle, the depths reveal—\nClouds part, the cold moon sinks into heaven’s void.\n\nAsking the mute for honey’s taste—unspeakable.\n**Its Seventh: Cloudyang Child**\nRaising a void fist,\nUnadorned by forms—\nScales and iron are but dust.\n\nDaring to endure the weight of the world,\nAt times, one must be a man of unyielding resolve.\nAncient Buddhas pluck the flower with a faint smile,\nYet in this age, how few stand waist-high in snow?\n\nLamenting the cuckoo’s bloodied branches—who understands?\nThe mute’s dream, hard to discern.\nThe deaf, who grasp the meaning.\n\nOn a lone peak’s summit,\nA wooden man speaks eloquently.\nCawing crows and howling monkeys debate the *non-duality* of the *Dao*,\nWhile pine winds and mountain waters reveal its profound truth.\n\nBreaking this mechanism, one sees the cold void—\nEvery household’s moon.\n\n**Its Eighth: Yuan’s Original Intent**\nAt the beginning, nothing exists—\nAll *Dharma*’s roots obscured by the void.\nLamenting those who drift along learning the *Dao*,\nWho refuse to sever before death.\n\nEmpty gestures and hollow punches—just noise.\nEyebrows raised, glances dart—endless posturing.\nSeeing the light of wisdom fall to earth,\nThe virtuous rise—\nLifting hands and feet.\n\nAbandon false thoughts,\nForget self and others.\nSever fame and gain,\nAvoid right and wrong.\nAccompany mist and clouds in secluded depths,\nWalk freely with ease.\n\nWhen realms dissolve, the mind forgets all birth—\nThe sky’s expanse vast and open.\nA single wheel of moon reveals itself in the cold pool,\nNo deception in truth.\n\n**Its Ninth: Mo’s Celestial Tripod**\n*Dharma*’s essence lies in the primal void,\nIts mysteries—\nBeyond words to say.\n\nIts core lies in guarding the *Zhong Zheng* (central rectitude),\nThe luminous *lingtai* (spiritual platform) clear.\nThe *Taiyi* (Great Polarity) dwells within the Yellow Valley,\nPrimal *qi* resides in the *Xuan Guan* (Mysterious Pass) orifice.\nMotionless and still, yet responsive—\nRelying on unyielding resolve.\n\nSummoning wind and thunder,\nPraying for rain and snow.\nCommanding spirits and demons,\nDriving away malevolent forces.\nThis is the *incantation of right and wrong*,\nNeither talisman nor *geometric magic*.\n\nIn stillness and calm, the spirit returns to the Yellow Valley’s domain,\nWhen merit is complete and the *Dao*’s path fulfilled—\nRanked among the celestial immortals.\nRiding the auspicious clouds of the *Taiyi*’s void,\nToward the golden gates.\n\n**Its Tenth: Purchasing Green Mountains**\nAcquiring green mountains,\nThen setting aside—\nStraw sandals and a staff of *Ligustrum*.\nNo need to linger,\nBelow the *Jian Zhang* (Celestial Building) Palace,\nAt the *Ba Ling* (Farewell) Bridge’s edge.\n\nThe world’s chaos awaits like a snail’s touch,\nWhile fame and gain are but ant-hills of hollow comfort.\nIn recent years, white hair has grown—\nThree thousand spans long.\nFrom now on, I cast off\nThe crimson dust’s entanglement.\nA green stone pillow,\nPine winds echoing.\n\nThe *Four Worthies of Shang* (Mountain) come and go at leisure,\nFire dates and autumn dew—\nA bargain’s worth.\nExchange pears, nurtured by spring’s warmth.\nCounting those who’ve matched my carefree freedom since antiquity—\nNone but me.\n\n**[The Farewell to Jiangnan] – Spring**\n*Chou Changchun* (Spring in the Mountains)\nMountains are good,\nBest in spring’s embrace.\nWildflowers red and white in myriad hues,\nThe *kuang ou* (mourning dove) calls in a hundred tones.\nThe misty greenery soaks one’s clothes.\nTea plucked fresh,\nBamboo shoots and ferns—\nLike wild violet, gathered.\n\nA hundredfold patched robe,\nForgotten worldly cares.\nA few cups of rustic wine,\nAligned with heaven’s *Dao*.\nDrunken, I let east and west drift.\n\n**Summer**\nMountains are good,\nLong summer suits them best.\nTowering bamboo, a thousand stalks—\nGolden chains shattered.\nA thousand-foot cascade—\nJade curtains hanging.\nWhere is the scorching sun?\nBeneath the pine’s shade,\nUnrestrained and free.\n\nDeep-fried plums and floating melons,\nServing as pillow and bedding.\nAncient pines and white stones,\nCompanions to the lute and chessboard.\nDrunken, I let the winds carry me.\n\n**Autumn**\nMountains are good,\nAutumn’s scene is not desolate.\nWhite wine, yellow fowl, and new rice—\nHarvest’s bounty ripe.\nPurple *zhu* (chrysanthemum) and golden *ju* (mallow), their fragrance pure.\nTangerines green with frost fill the woods—\nCool moon shines white,\nPines and *gui* (cryptomeria) stand dark and deep.\nOnly the village elder’s song of joy at the *she* (land deity) festival is heard,\nNo young men at the gate.\nDrunken, what does it matter?\n\n**Winter**\nMountains are good,\nYet the last praise belongs to winter.\nPaper curtains and rush mats—\nFragrance faint, like jade’s pale glow.\nBamboo stove and tea kiln—\nFlames burn deep red.\nCrossed arms in warmth, the *chong* (tea ceremony) shared.\nMan is but a dream,\nA hundred years pass in an instant’s thought.\nWhen plum blossoms burst, the spring’s pulse stirs,\nWhere snowflakes fall, the *yang* (sores/ulcers) vanish without trace.\nDrunken, I am the slave of spring’s wind.\n\n---\n**Moonlight on the Sea-Tang (月上海棠)**\n*Simao* (Simao) of the *Lun* (Lun) sect,\nEver mindful, never idle.\nIn coarse robes and hempen cords,\nA satchel slung at my side.\nHair shorn, my head bare,\nUnbound, I tread where I will.\nWith bowl and *dian* (bamboo begging cup),\nEach day I alms-beg at the doors.\nBowing low, I take leave—\nThen stumble upon a demon who speaks.\n\n“Daoist Master,” he asks,\n“Whose household are you from?”\nI answer as fate allows:\n“My teacher’s name is Qiu Liu Tan Ma.”\n\n---\n**Second Poem**\nLast night, passing through *Bei Mang* (Northern Mound),\nI saw a skull beside the road.\nRain washed it, winds blew—\nA herdsman’s staff shattered its rest.\nI knew him as Li Si, Zhang San, or Wang Da.\nHe bowed in silence, pondering me:\nWhen death’s hour comes, how can one flee?\nThough he had a thousand in gold,\nNo fortune could spare this calamity.\nCease your complaints—\nAll must meet the same end.\n\n---\n**Third Poem**\nMy words have warned countless thousands,\nYet none turn fiercely back.\nI teach a thousand ways,\nYet they still cling to *huoyuan* (fire-karmic) bonds.\nNo reckoning—\nEach life only defers the next.\nWorried for sons and daughters without food or clothes,\nThey hope a hundred years’ companionship will last.\nThe *Yanwang* (King of Hell) arrives to demand,\nGhostly messengers knock at the door.\nDragged away, they do not question\nWhether family ties are severed.\n\n---\n**Willow Pavilion (山亭柳)**\nWorldly affairs are cause for sorrow,\nThe fleeting light of days cannot be held.\nSpring fades, then autumn comes again—\nThe seasons press one toward old age,\nA hundred years like *Zhuang Zhou’s* (Chuang Tzu’s) butterfly dream.\nSeeing through the past as illusion,\nWhy cling to idle cares?\nBoldly, I meet the *Xiyi* (Hsi-i, \"One-Eyed\") teaching,\nWorldly passions—\nAll swept away in a stroke.\nI vow to hasten my cultivation.\nYet fools, even when called by *Ma Dan Yang* (Madan Yang),\nStill will not turn.\nBound by karmic debts, they become skulls,\nOr wailing cranes in *Xu* (Xu)’s voice.\n\n---\n**Note on the Following Text:**\nBelow is the *Su Wu Man* (蘇武慢) composed by **Venerable Feng** (冯尊师)

red willows,\nRevisiting the hermitage at Pu Mountain.\n\n**Mountain Stream**\nBetter to return than to stay,\nBecoming a man of tranquil ease.\nWhat need is there to provoke,\nOthers’ endless troubles and strife?\nHeaven’s vast allowance—\nWhere cannot one take shelter?\nLet me just wander,\nWith a life of means,\nTesting thoughts to see.\n\nIn the mirror of the lake,\nShallow hills by the forest’s edge.\nDwelling in a small hermitage,\nLiving by fate’s modest share—\nCoarse robes, simple fare.\nMocking the wind, praising the moon,\nCarefree beyond all mortal years.\nWorldly affairs,\nAll like hemp—\nWho can I blame?\n\n**Wandering Drifter**\nBetween emerald bamboo, verdant pine,\nLayered shadows deep.\nThe Daoist’s pavilion in clouds of white.\nAcross the shore, red dust cannot reach,\nWater soaks the cold void.\nThis scene matches that of the **Qiao** hermit,\nThe sage of the cave’s entrance.\nAfter plucking the zither, he overturns the golden incense burner.\nLaughing defiantly at mist and haze, he has no cares,\nBeneath the bright moon and pure wind.\n\n**Second [Section]**\n\n---\n\n**The Third [Section]**\n**A Master of the Dao**\n\nA lone

years of life—\nDo not waste them in vain.\n\n**耳却听嘱付，仙风道骨，莫向红尘埋堕。**\nHear the Master’s instructions well:\nWith Daoist bearing, do not sink into the dust of the world.\n\n**省呵。把师父亲言记着。**\nReflect—remember the Master’s words.\n\n**你原是蓬莱洞裹仙，为思凡、人间沦落。**\nYou were once an immortal of Penglai’s cave,\nYet fell to mortal longing, lost in the world below.\n\n**速整仙胎归上会，莫荏苒、俗情系缚。**\nSwiftly refine your immortal essence and return to the Celestial Gathering—\nDo not linger, bound by worldly affections.\n\n**自思忖，假饶积玉堆金，终久幻化如何。**\nConsider this: though you hoard jade and gold,\nAll will dissolve—what then remains?\n\n**青梅引**\n*(I smile at those who deceive me, untrusting.)*\n**我笑迷人，不信乖劣。**\nI laugh at those who lead others astray—\nUnbelieving in their deceit.\n\n**痴心恋，贪名利萦击。**\nFoolish love, ensnared by fame and gain.\n\n**落魄狂游，每将术艺养道，用安身己。**\nCast off, wandering wildly—\nDaily cultivating arts to nourish the Dao,\nTo secure my own being.\n\n**道知和息。**\nThe Dao knows peace.\n\n**藜杖药瓢，蓑衣蛮笠。**\nWith gourd staff and medicine gourd,\nIn raincoat and straw hat.\n\n**纵大地有满地真珠，那的直甚闲气。**\nThough the earth were paved with pearls,\nWhat use is such idle wealth?\n\n**无限峰峦耸翠。**\nEndless peaks rise in emerald splendor.\n\n**略撰个茅庵，用做栖心，幸有灵苗裔。**\nA humble thatched hut—my dwelling place,\nFortunate to have such a blessed

drift.\n\n**便使乌龟开口，出头喜谟，吸洪涛、枯乾北海，使巨波、浇灌西湖。**\nEven if the Tortoise speaks,\nIts joyful words would drain the Northern Sea’s tides,\nPouring vast waves to flood the Western Lake.\n\n**自舒敷。**\nSpreading

the furnace, the elixir burns,\nForming a radiant pearl.\n\n**玉皇深恩宣诏。**\nThe Jade Emperor’s profound grace is proclaimed.\n\n**祥云攒罩。**\nAuspicious clouds gather above.\n\nAt that time, steady astride the Azure Crane,\nReturn to Penglai Isle.\n\n**Refining the elixir sand** *(Waves Winnowing Sand)*\n**Master Ma Dan-yang**\nTo walk the Dao, the heart must be unyielding,\nGuard the elixir field with vigilance.\nHarmonize the true breath, ever flowing.\nWithin the twelve hours, ever present—\nDo not let worldly dust entangle you.\nThe secret lies in avoiding clamor,\nIn quietude, find true repose.\nSilent speech must be mastered.\nWhen the divine elixir ripens, the Way is fulfilled,\nAnd one ascends to the Celestial Court.\n\n**Pointing at the Crimson Layer** *(Note: \"层\" likely refers to a Daoist alchemical stage or layer)*\n**Master Quan Zhen**\nA humble gourd—\nBorn naturally, wondrous in its simplicity.\nShort of stature,\nYet the gourd has a mouth,\nDifficult to open, hard to explain.\nRecognizing Heaven and Earth—\nWho can truly grasp this truth?\nA belt at the waist,\nThe Daoist cherishes it above all,\nNot exchanging it for a golden fish pouch.\n\n**Second Verse**\nAlas, all seek fame and gain,\nBound in endless cycles of greed.\nWhen will it end?\nOnly when the eyes fall to the earth,\nDo they finally regret.\nThough children and grandchildren may follow,\nThey cannot bear the burden in your stead.\nTears well up—\nThis bitter taste,\nShatters the heart before it is known.\n\n**Third Verse**\n**Master Qiu Chang-chun**\nLast night, drunken and dazed,\nIn intoxication, I seemed to ride the elixir phoenix.\nWith music and song,\nI soared through the Four Heavens,\nAwakening to the Peach Blossom Cavern’s depths.\nFacing the deep ravine,\nI leisurely played with a radiant pearl.\nAt dawn’s first stir,\nA gust of wind carried me away—\nThe dream of immortality shattered.\nThe crane’s cry fades into silence.\n\n**Verse (Continuation of *行香子* / *青莲池上客*)**\n\n**Flower-lined paths and rocky peaks**—\nThe *Zhōnglí* bell tolls.\nThe Four Great Elements are void of self,\nThe Five Aggregates are inherently empty.\nCease to vie with others and with self,\nStrutting as heroes.\nNoble or base, wise or foolish—\nAll shall meet in the realm of dreams.\nA hundred years of kin and loved ones,\nWrapped in crimson light,\nShould each be bound in their own fate.\n\nI urge you to diligently refine your practice,\nEver reflecting on the original essence.\nWhen you come, you bring nothing,\nWhen you go, you are void.\nHuman life is finite,\nYet greed spins endlessly.\nBetter to live within your allotted measure,\nFor even a spark of luminous clarity\nNaturally yields moonlit breezes and pure winds.\n\n---\n**Second Verse (*Jiāngshénzǐ* / *吕洞宾*)**\n\nRare is the man who lives to seventy years of age.\nAlas, the foolish are lost—\nThey do not cultivate the Dao.\nTime is finite,\nYet triumph and failure hinge on right and wrong.\nWorldly glory and renown are all seized,\nYet in vain—\nFor *karmic bonds* follow them.\nTemporarily, they are bewitched by wine, song, and wealth,\nGaining but losing in the same breath.\nDarkness veils their youthful bloom,\nGradually draining their *qi* and spirit.\nWith vigor waning and decline creeping,\nWho can they blame but themselves?\nHow then is the Dao?\n**Autumn at Qū River**—\n\nThis point, ancient and modern, is sought in confusion.\nAll have their allotment, yet none lack.\nAll because of mistaken thoughts—\nWhere attachment clings, there suffering arises.\nIf one lets go of each and every thing,\nWhat mysteries remain?\nLive in accordance with one’s measure and fate,\nUncover the original face—\nThis must be made clear.\nCold hearth, cold stove,\nFacing tigers and dragons in song and cry.\nRight before you—this is it.\nNo need to seek beyond.\n\nNo need to ask of gods or Buddhas,\nOnly shared awakening awareness.\n\n---\n**Melon Blossom Tune** — *Qiu Changchun*\nWithout toil in walking, without weariness in sitting.\nLet me wander or rest as I please.\nMorning breeze light, evening sky clear.\nThe Dao’s path unfettered—\nSouth Creek flows level above and below.\nEast of the creek, fortunate to forget form in friendship,\nBright moon when night wine is poured.\nThe cup pauses, moonlight pure.\nUnfastening my robe, hair unbound,\nJoyfully singing of the Way.\n\n---\n**Ascending Flower** — *Wu Zhenren*\nThe restless mind locked away,\nAwakening to dust and time’s swift flight—\nA hundred years pass in an instant.\nBegin practice now—\nThe original true spirit must dwell here today.\nAt home in pits and trenches,\nFirst leap free from the self,\nMaking solitude your host.\nStillness without disturbance.\nWealth, desire, color, wine—\nAll must be abandoned.\nCutting off all worldly attachments,\nEven father, mother, wife, and kin.\nFree and unbound,\nFallen into carefree ease,\nRecognize the gold and jade wrapped in rags.\nThe flower’s heart stirs,\nScent filling the air.\nStrange light clusters,\nAuspicious radiance gleams,\nForming celestial melodies.\n\n---\n**Step of the Moon Palace** — *Lü Dongbin*\nKan, Li, Zhen, Dui, and Zi-Wu aligned—\nRecognize your own ancestral roots.\nEarth-thunder resounds,\nShaking rain from mountain peaks.\nGradually nourishing,\nYellow sprouts break from the soil.\nSeizing golden essence, firmly sealed.\nRefining the elixir—\nTaming dragons and tigers.\nIf asked who transmits this,\nOnly say: *My surname is Lü.*\n\n---\n**Double Swallows** — *Qiu Changchun*\nSpring mist drifts faintly,\nGreen hills charming, wandering clouds scattered in the void.\nFlower-light and stone-moisture reveal\nStrange wonders of the immortal realm.\nWindows and doors rise a thousand zhang—\nAll senses revel in wind’s swift joy.\nLifetimes of suffering and dusty passions,\nNow boundless and pure—no trace of the mundane.\nWorthy of love.\nFree and unbound,\nShedding shackles, free of karmic debt.\nWind as companion, ears attuned,\nDao in harmony with crystal heavens.\nEndless towering peaks—\nAll bestowed upon the mountain hall’s teachings.\nThousand-vehicle pearls—\nWho can pay the price?\n\n---\n**No Worries to Dissolve** — *San Yu Zhenren*\nFrom ancient times to now,\nMany sorrows, few joys—\nPure simplicity and peace are rare.\nFortunate to meet sages in the world.\nProclaiming Dao and discussing the *Luòtiān*,\nTrue immortals descending from above.\nRuling all under heaven without toil,\nInner and outer cease war, embrace culture,\nHonor the worthy, cherish virtue,\nBringing clear peace and blessings.\nHow then repay Heaven’s grace?\nWasting fine moments in triviality.\nFirst uphold frugality,\nEnsure warmth and fullness—\nNo greed for fame or gain.\nSeek Dao’s mysteries in the Mysterious Gate.\nAbandon desires, preserve harmonious *qi*.\nFurther, let go—\nEach thought, each thing—\nOnly then escape human burdens.\n\n---\n**Wooden Lantern Slow** —\nLight and pure, my essence refined,\nAlone with Heaven in boundless play.\nYet bound in mortal flesh,\nEncircled by the Five Phases,\nTrapped by the Four Great Elements.\nAll years spent in delusion, unaware,\nClinging to illusions of sound and color.\nThe original immortal realm—\nSo near, yet distant as heaven and earth.\nTo seek return to the root, restore the origin,\nOnly the heart must decide.\nSilently focus the essence,\nAlways probing, seeking—\nSurely the work will be complete.\nSuddenly, emptiness shatters,\nAll lifetimes’ karmic barriers vanish.\nShaking sleeves, bound for Penglai and Kunlun,\nNo fear of weak waters without a boat.\nAt leisure in intoxication,\nLeaning against green mountains.\nAwake, plucking the jade zither,\nPlaying *Hèwū* of the Nine Marshes.\nWater clear, mountains near,\nSerene and free in joy.\nI too return to Kunlun’s halls,\nAscend Penglai’s isle.\nThus, for now, dwelling among mortals,\nWith Creation, wandering the Great Void,\nNurturing form and spirit—\nBoth perfectly preserved.\n\n---\n**Upper Flat Western Tune**\nThis *wu-chang* (impermanence),\nTwo characters—most difficult to guard.\nWhen it comes, no place to hide.\nNo matter old or young,\nPoor or rich, virtuous or base.\nNo matter wife or child,\nHow can one cling to parents?\nBody returns to earth, blood to water,\nSoul and breath scatter with the wind.\nLook closely—\nHow could one not grieve?\nDo not covet the fire hall,\nEarly cultivate the heavenly realm.\nThree thousand merits fulfilled, bound for Penglai,\nForever in the immortal land.\n\n---\n**Second Verse**\nThe same.\n\n**First Verse**\nSummoning the clear breeze, inviting the bright moon—\nCome and go, as one pleases.\nReflecting on how much\nIdle chatter is idle folly.\nFacing mountains, near waters,\nClose to pines and bamboo, near plum blossoms.\nIn the modest courtyard, few daily tasks—\nPoetry, wine, the zither, and chess.\nNo entanglements, no vexations,\nNo partings.\nAwaiting transformation,\nEver in simple foolishness.\nMosquito’s bite, snail’s horn—\nGains and losses—\nWhat more is there to do?\nBetter to hear the true essence of early joy,\nLying high on the clouded stairs.\n\n---\n**Second Verse**\n*(Chou Changchun)*\nThe sun and moon revolve without end.\nSpring departs, autumn arrives—\nHow many flourishings and decays!\nFive Emperors, Three Sovereigns, countless ages—\nEach rise and fall is thus.\nDeath and birth, birth and death again.\nEndless cycles of change—\nWhen will they cease?\nOnly when reaching the heartless resting place\nCan one attain true stillness beyond all else.\n\n---\n**Third Verse**\n*(Bai Yuzhen)*\nGreen fades, red thins—spring is gone.\nSwallows carry mud,\nFlying into the weeping willows.\nWillow fluff lingers, but the wind won’t stop;\nCuckoos cry endlessly through the mountains.\nWith bamboo staff and straw sandals, no fixed abode.\nFine groves and streams—\nTrusting my feet to guide my path.\nHow much of this heart’s stirrings?\nA river’s wind and moon—who rules them?\n\n---\n**Fourth Verse**\n*(Chou Changchun)*\nThe golden rooster turns westward to greet the Jade Emperor.\nEastward, the silver hare glows,\nIts radiance veiling the green osmanthus.\nGradually, the South Hua gathering of chrysanthemums begins,\nFilled with wine from the Northern Sea—drunk, utterly drunk.\nDrunkenly reclining in the Zhongnan Mountains’ hues,\nMountain colors pure and high, night unclouded.\nNot a crow’s cry—only the wind grows fine,\nMoonlight bright as day, sky like water.\n\n---\n**Fifth Verse**\nA secluded, rugged peak—pure and clear.\nCarving jade for dwelling, embracing the Way without knowing or understanding.\nDao companions look at each other—do not be surprised.\nPoverty and simplicity, no pretenses.\nWealth, honor, and fame—rely on them?\nMany gains are many losses—\nGradually, excess leads to ruin.\nRich feasts and fragrant meats cannot be endured,\nBut coarse rice and water bring lasting peace.\n\n---\n**Sixth Verse**\nWhen fortune comes, rest while you can—\nThat is rest.\nWinning true ease,\nLet the hare lead your mind and body.\nHow many clever and heroic souls\nBusy themselves, squandering their lives’ purpose.\nCreation shifts without end.\nYesterday’s joy, today’s sorrow.\nToday unknown, tomorrow’s fate—\nWhy weary the mind over such trifles?\n\n---\n**Seventh Verse**\nToday, I ponder yesterday’s old self.\nKnowing my path ahead,\nSo distant, so hard to cross.\nFortune does not linger, Heaven offers no aid—\nHastening away, no way to stay.\nNow, a walking corpse, I’ve awakened.\nMy spirit drifts—\nFor now, dwell by the Pan Stream.\nTo my neighbors, noble and common alike,\nOften I am remembered.\n\n---\n**Song of the Incense Offering**\nA single fly,\nInto a bloody basin.\nWhen it tastes the sweetness,\nStraight to the heart it goes,\nForgetting to lift itself.\nStained its feet, stained its wings—\nLost its form.\nHow I sigh—\nHow could it not move me?\nSweetness hides bitterness,\nFortune breeds disaster.\nOnce knowing the taste,\nBetter to withdraw.\nYou are so blind,\nSo foolish—\nA great, fat fly.\n\n---\n**Peony in the Rain**\n*(Wang Chongyang)*\nHow much wine for the Double-Ninth Feast—\nThrough it, the Dao’s mysteries unfold.\nA coarse hemp robe, a blue cloth cap.\nWell-made, truly well-made—\nA spirit truly refined.\n\n**Song of the Pillow Screen**\nNo need for mirrors to reflect—\nAll things are clear within the mind.\nIn dreams, one recognizes the dream-self.\nThis is true freedom—\nThe one who reaches the other shore.\n\n**Boat on the River**\nTraversed famous mountains,\nAll peaks and ridges passed through.\nClimbing high slopes,\nAscending steep ridges—\nWhy weary the spirit?\nThe Way is within the body,\nYet the mind clings to things,\nEntangled, evading.\nNever losing\nThe original self.\n\nDay and night we walk together,\nAt dusk, we sleep and rest as one.\nTill dawn, we follow as before,\nTogether walking, together seated.\nSuddenly—\nIn an instant—\nIt becomes clear:\nYou are my elder brother.\n\n---\n\n**Divination of Fate**\n*(Sun Xiangu)*\nFirmly grasping robes, awaiting the hour,\nWater and fire intertwine.\nA million hues of light rise from the ocean’s depths,\nPiercing the Three Passes in a single column.\nCelestial music plays without cease,\nEver drinking the nectar of enlightenment.\nWondrous elixirs manifest in an instant—\nThe Nine-Turn Golden Elixir complete.\n\n---\n\n**Joyous Departure**\n*(Qiu Changchun)*\nTo leave birth and death behind.\n\n**First Verse**\nDiscard all old habits, grinding them down from the start.\nA thousand layers of desire—\nBody and mind refined a hundred times,\nForged into an iron will of one inch.\n\nRelease the Six Spirits, harmonious and unmoved,\nThe Three Corpses stumble in confusion.\nAct with fierce resolve.\nRely on the boundless void,\nUnfeeling and undivided.\nThe knot is bound—\nThe shackles are cast off.\nOnly then does one meet the True Person,\nWhose golden mouth transmits the subtle secret.\nInstantly, the spirit wind blows away the demonic barrier,\nThe form becomes like carved wood or molded clay.\nHaving obtained the Nature-Pearl,\nThe Heavenly Treasure is pierced through—\nSpring flowers, autumn moons.\nAt that time—\nGhosts cannot call out;\nOnly the Immortals guide and lift.\n\n**Second Verse**\nDisgusted with worldly filth,\nOne takes delight in emptiness and ease,\nMaking purity a companion.\nThe sword gleams with cold light,\nWeapons rest beneath cloud-generals,\nVictorious over the Five Phases’ marauders.\nThe Cavernous Mysteries’ treasure is secured,\nEscaping the shell of yin and yang.\nThe Great Elixir is complete.\nRefining and plucking the sun and moon,\nCaressing stars and constellations—\nOutstanding and peerless.\nSurpassing past and future,\nResponding to myriad affairs with manifest divine power.\nAn iron gate stands firm,\nGolden needles and jade threads—\nPiercing through seven and eight layers everywhere.\nSummoning the embroidered qilin and lions,\nAwakening waterfowl and mountain beasts.\nSwiftly turning back,\nToward the Azure Peak’s embrace,\nSleeping high in the pure daylight.\n\n**Third Verse**\nDo not seek the arcane mysteries.\n\nI have made clear the keys to cultivation—\nFight the enemy of slumber, forget desire and sever thought—\nThis is the true teaching of sages.\n\nEat and drink to still doubt,\nDiligently cultivate awareness each day.\nDo not err.\n\nWait until there is neither sleep nor waking,\nThen the heart aligns with the Dao.\n\nThere are profound harmonies and marvels—\nRefining qi into spirit yields a golden radiance.\nThe Five Qi ascend to the Primordial,\nThe Three Flowers gather at the crown,\nWater and fire circulate in reverse.\n\nThe Nine Suns coalesce into the Elixir of Return,\nPiercing the Soul’s Platform to its eight extremes.\nThe work is complete.\n\nOn the path to longevity, leisurely wandering the Three Isles.\n\n**Fourth Verse**\nTo regulate true breath—\nDiscuss the root source, attaining its living reality.\nQi is the heart’s essence,\nSpirit governs qi—when the heart stirs, spirit and qi separate.\nWhen the heart is tranquil, yin and yang embrace,\nMind settled, true essence forms naturally.\nDo not mistake it.\n\nThis inner breath-regulation\nIs not about artificial contortions—\nIgnorant of the Embryonic Origin’s principle.\nOpen eyes, nose, and fingers—\nThe Spirit Tortoise and Serpent play.\nFollowing the Dao’s ancestral tradition,\nReturning light to its source,\nBreath naturally returns to its root.\nA clean breeze suddenly passes through the door,\nWater and fire instantly complete their cycle.\n\nAt this stage,\nTrue constancy is within arm’s reach—\nA Three-Life Buddha manifests in the world.\n\n**Fifth Verse**\nReturning to the dusty world,\nBreak free from entanglements—\nHow long can one roam untrammled?\nCoarse robes and simple headbands,\nPatched garments and frayed tails—\nThis is the way home.\n\nAsked why I hide,\nI point to the pine and moss’s verdant shade.\nWrapped in Azure Mist,\nThere are monkeys and cranes of the Lake of Heaven,\nFriends who know the heart’s intent.\nUnmatched.\nLeisure is noble.\nResting on Laozi and Zhuangzi’s wisdom,\nNot coveting noble titles.\nWater trousers and mountain sandals,\nRain cloaks and moon flutes—\nA distinct flavor of refinement.\n\nHow to obtain such news?\nSince ancient times, the lineage of immortals.\nFulfilling my purpose,\nI let the shifting lands transform,\nLife’s rise and fall pass by.\n\n**Sixth Verse**\nWith myriad ties released,\nI wander with staff and sandals,\nThrough fields and neighbors’ homes.\nRain hat and wind cloak,\nQuail robes and crane bones—\nHiding in the jade-green peaks’ shade.\nWorldly turmoil fills the eye,\nYet beyond it, the Dao’s mystery reigns supreme.\n\nThe virtue’s wind spreads,\nDelighting in purity and tranquility,\nWithout striving in the world’s affairs.\nSerene and refined,\nRiding clouds and cranes,\nReturning to my ancestral home,\nWhere swallows and orioles sing of Wang and Xie’s glory.\nPure waters and rocks,\nDeep valleys and distant peaks—\nAbove the dust of noble carriages.\nA thousand years of praise and blame,\nSuccess and failure—\nAll dissolved in a nap of mist and river wilds.\n\nWonderful!\nThis life I would sell—\nWho could pay its price?\n\n**Seventh Verse**\nCast aside fame and gain.\n\n**Eighth Verse**\nEntering the vast lands of **Guangmo**’s village,\nI meander with ease, winding and turning.\nBy winding streams and mountain barriers,\nIn misty hamlets and cloud-draped dwellings,\nI wear simple hemp-cloth and humble herbs—\nWhat need have I of jade halls and lofty caps?\nMy aspirations are boundless.\n\nTo the eastern fence, I while away my days,\nIn the western garden, I chant and sip.\nEndless and far-reaching—\nI do nothing, yet live in harmony.\nIf no kindred soul appears,\nWhere shall I speak of the Dao’s subtleties?\n\nBooks and zithers, stone altars and clay cauldrons—\nBeyond these, no true joy exists.\nRefined and serene, my demeanor flows like wind,\nYet who now bears witness to my radiance?\n\nI seek my own peace.\nA pine by the stream, a moon in the wilds,\nA thousand years of monkeys and cranes.\n\n**Ninth Verse**\nCutting off all worldly attachments,\nI awaken from the dream of toil—\nLike a quail dwelling in a thatched hut.\nFeeding ants, roasting fowl,\nIn dusty robes and wind-worn caps,\nI’ve won a hundred years of idle waste.\n\nGain is like fading mist and fleeting light,\nFame like fallen petals and scattered threads.\nHow could it endure?\n\nLike a candle in the wind, or dew on a branch—\nWho understands?\n\nAlone, I return.\nGathering the waters and clouds,\nI lie high on the **Caoxi** path.\nBeyond the bamboo, the spring’s flow,\nBy the fence, wild chrysanthemums,\nAnd the scattered blossoms of the wild crabapple—\nAll idle pleasures.\n\nBefore the Five-Pine Fence, I drink and recite,\nWith one laugh, transcending the ages.\nI wish to impart this wisdom—\nYet sigh at the misty waves’ vastness,\nWhere are the true listeners?\n\n**Water Dragon Song**\nFrom the jade incense burner, a hundred devout breaths rise,\nA single stick of faith-inspiring fragrance,\nSwirling and ascending.\nRevolving and weaving,\nThey form a canopy of glory.\nRepaying the heavens and the earth.\n\nEncompassing grace.\n\nRepay the virtue/power of the sun and moon’s illumination,\nRepay the king’s land and water, for abundance and joy,\nRepay the love and care of parents.\nAbove, I thank the venerable ancestors and their sacred teachings,\nThe Master of Dan Yang for transmitting the lineage.\n\nUniversal salvation in the dusty world,\nThe Complete Reality Dao/Way endures eternally.\nMaster Qiu [Zhang] once dwelled in Ninghai.\nTogether, the three of us secretly harmonized with the Dharma-realm.\n\nMay the king reign ten thousand years,\nAnd loyal ministers serve through a thousand autumns—\nI invite the disciples to bow in reverence.\n\n---\n**Second [Song] #6**\nCounting the fleeting world’s ceaseless rush,\nCompeting for desires, weary of vexations.\nSix dynasties, five tyrants,\nThree kingdoms, seven states—\nEastward and westward campaigns.\nWhere now are the martial strategies?\nOnly desolation remains—wildflowers and fragrant grasses.\n\nLament the profound schemes and far-sighted plans,\nThe mighty hearts and bold qi—\nAll faded, now ashen and withered.\nTreading the ancient paths of Chang’an.\n\nAsk the aged remnants of the outskirts:\nThe Tang palaces, Han gardens,\nQin walls, Zhou ramparts—\nAll now overgrown with fragrant grasses.\n\nSeeing the old sites, lingering with longing,\nYet former companions have scattered—\nNo word of them remains.\nReflecting on life’s brief span—\nFrom dawn to dusk—\nHeaven and earth endure, yet who can guarantee anything?\n\n**#4**\n*[Night’s Clear]* The sky’s vastness breaks the chill,\nA pale, translucent heaven—like emerald glass, pure and bright.\nNo shade beneath the trees,\nIn Chang’an’s towers, the moon glows soft, the breeze fine.\n\nA hundred calamities fade unseen,\nTen thousand households share the joy,\nAll partake in one crisp delight.\nBehold the golden—\n\nStars gleam, clear and bold,\nThe Milky Way stands firm and wide,\nTheir light converges, filling earth and heaven.\nFlowing through the sapphire expanse like water’s grace.\n\nUnbounded, free to roam,\nNo pause, no halt—\nCrashing mountains, sweeping seas,\nLight cascades, radiant and unbounded,\nEndless blessings pour forth, pure and bright.\n\nFrom this moment, all is known:\nThe Celestial Vessel stands firm,\nJade nectar flows like mud.\nMy heart’s longing seeks a voice,\nYet who could ever understand?\nLet me be lost in blissful intoxication.\n\n---\n\n**#5**\n*[Dawn’s Clarity]* The boundless chaos opens in the Southern Peak,\nAuspicious clouds emerge from Kunlun’s heights.\nStars shift, lightning flashes,\nShadows rise, light descends—\nA crimson glow, faint yet vast.\n\nCranes dance, phoenixes soar,\nWatch the tortoise and dragon coil in harmony.\nAll of Hongmeng’s breath,\nBoiled into Creation’s grand design,\nThe Dao of immortals—\nInstantly revealed.\n\nTen thousand worlds scatter the Three Isles.\nThe Celestial Cavern deepens—\nMoonlit, winds curl with elegance.\nAt this hour, I grasp the gate to eternal life,\nLong years of vigor, perfect attunement.\n\nLet others sing of change—\nMountains shift, seas transform,\nStones wither, pines age,\nWhile I alone consort with mist and clouds,\nBeyond the realm of strife,\nYet grieve for few who truly know.\n\n---\n\n**#6**\nI was born to leave the dusty world,\nNo longer coveting mortal splendor’s fleeting allure.\nDisheveled hair, face stained with grime,\nAll day alone, my inner work refined.\nIn ancient temples, treasures wrapped in silence,\nLet the red wheel sink westward.\n\nThe void is known as presence,\nWhite as black—I guard in stillness,\nEndless threads of thought unwind,\nSilent harmony, my breath attuned.\nNo cares cling to my heart.\n\nWith a satchel at my side,\nA staff to lean upon,\nGrass sandals, short robes,\nWorn legs, sheepskin for cover.\nHunger leads me to beg at doors,\nSated, I hum—*la li la li*—\nLet others mock me, fool or sluggard,\nWho could ever truly see?\n\n*[Auspicious Crane, Immortal’s Song]*\nA hundred years like dreams of butterflies.\nLament the past and present—\nHow many heroes once aspired to rule,\nYet now are but tales for fishermen and hunters, idle chatter.\n\nQin palaces, Han gates—\nNow only fox trails, rabbit dens.\nRemembering splendor’s hollow glow:\nWealth like hot water on snow.\nReflect—\n\nGreed harms the body, profits none,\nEmpty fame like Wu Yue’s fleeting states.\nFollow fate’s guidance, nurture my simplicity.\nThe gate closed, strife abandoned.\nAt noon, my knees rest by the window,\nA small stream for my fishing line,\nSeated before peaks piled in endless layers.\n\nAt night, the zither joins me,\nWith those who truly understand—\nJade sky, silver moon.\nThe rooster crows, the wooden horse neighs in the wind,\nYet I remain unchanged.\n\n**[The Stone Man Nods, the Mute Speaks]**\nA stone man nods in assent,\nA mute speaks clearly.\nA blue-eyed barbarian monk\nPoints to the heavens with no hands—\nDraws a circle.\nNo truth to convey.\n\nLet wild passions rage as they will,\nLike water spilling from a shattered jar.\nIn vain do craftsmen toil,\nGrinding tiles to polish.\nWhy contrive such schemes?\nTo outdo others in rivalry.\n\nArmor laid aside, war’s end—\nThe Four Quarters in lasting peace.\nNo need for Zen meditation,\nNo quest for immortals.\nPure as clarified butter,\nI know its natural state.\n\nNo step need be moved to reach the Western Paradise.\nA wooden man bars the way,\nBut the iron ox is led along.\nFire wraps a lotus in birth—\nThe Dao beyond the Dao.\n\nClouds gather, the moon swells full.\nA stone maiden stops her loom,\nHer golden needle piercing thread.\nThank you, Third Brother,\nGrant me your fishing boat.\n\nGilded scales gleam in armor,\nRed brocade ever more vibrant.\nNo waves disturb—\nI float and sink as nature wills.\nSelf-satisfied,\nI forget the net.\n\nWho dares scatter these tidings?\n*[Dreaming of Immortals]*\n**Chou Changchun**\n\n*Dreaming of Immortals*\nPlainly, I have passed through the Ninefold Heavens.\nMy **qi** vast and refined,\nPiercing white clouds, boundless and ethereal.\nLike the **Daode** Assembly at dawn—\nGolden boys and jade girls descend to proclaim.\n\nThen all sages gathered,\nThe Great Bright Light encasing the golden lotus.\nImmortal hymns resounded,\nCelestial realms rejoiced—\nAll forgot speech in delight.\nNectar flowed in cups,\nPeach clusters feasted upon,\nEach lingering in turn.\n\nAll wielded **virtue/power** and authority.\nTheir **spiritual powers** free,\nAges could not displace them.\nBefore the **Primordial Void**, boundless,\nHeaven’s limits nonexistent—\nThe **Emperor of Forms**’s first emanation.\nPiercing the **Ultimate Mysteries**.\n\nMy carriage drifts in mist,\nMy spirit soars through fire,\nA million miles in spiraling flight.\nThe Four Extremes, above and below,\nThe Eight Directions—\nNo need to whip the **Luan** and **He** cranes.\n\nWhen called, I arrive at the hour,\nNo obstacles—\nRoots of my own accord.\nI’ve seen all of **Qingdu**’s crimson gates,\nCrossed **Yingzhou** and **Zifu** Palace—\nNo pen can capture it.\n\nAt **Youtai** and **Langyuan**’s flowered halls,\nAuspicious clouds cast their light,\nA hundred harmonies in the fragrant breeze.\nSpring’s endless day, eternal warmth—\nEverywhere, I feel at ease.\n\nReflecting on **karma**,\nA single spark suffices to perfect it.\nMerged with the **Primordial Void**,\nGreat calamities stretch on forever.\nLet the **Jinding** world crumble,\nMountains collapse into caves,\nSeas turn to mulberry fields—\n\n*Spring in the Brocade Hall*\nSpeak of my deepest heart.\n\nAwakening to **Nanguo**’s dream—\nA fleeting vision, roots like yellow dust.\nShattering **luxury’s** allure,\nClouds bestow **plainness**,\nRecognizing the **lineage’s** truth—\nLight returns to its source.\nWith wisdom’s blade,\nI sever the net of attachment,\nAnd with my **li** staff,\nI smash the dusty world.\n\nThere we meet again,\nAt **Emamei**’s slopes,\nHiding my radiance, swift as lightning,\nBeside **Donghua** Mountain.\nHidden in groves and streams,\nSouthern **Chen** and Northern **Dou**,\nSun and moon tucked in my sleeves.\nMy face ageless,\nThough heaven shatters and earth collapses—\nMy true nature remains unchanged.\n\nDancing in my sleeves,\nI scorn the narrowness of **Qiankun**,\nOnly spreading my hands—\nHeaven and earth measured equally.\nDrunk with joy,\nMy sack holds the four seas,\nLaughing with delight,\nMy belly stores the three rivers.\n\nHow many times at **Youtai**’s feast,\nThe **Longevity Peach**’s gatherings—\nImmortal banquets, cups raised to the clouds.\n**Zhuli** arrives,\nThe Jade Emperor hosts the feast—\nWithout me, it cannot proceed.\nThe **Double-Ninth Festival**,\nSeven golden lotuses bloom,\nTheir divine light radiant as one.\n\n*[The Living Skull]*\n\nThe reckoning of life’s vanity—what grand wind flows here?\nClad in robes to shield the form, yet squandering the spirit,\nWasting years in hollow toil.\nNo thought of impermanence’s approach,\nNo dread of **Yanlao’s** summons to depart.\nCunningly contriving schemes,\nBusy with schemes of greed—\nEndless strife, yet bound in suffering.\nEmpty bustle, fleeting fame, thin gains—\nOnly more idle sorrow to provoke.\nA breath of three inches—\nOnce severed, lone on barren hills I lie.\nSighing through ages, rise and fall—\nTime flees swift, cannot be stayed.\nHow fine to drift free, refine the nature,\nCast aside past arrogance.\nLay down dusty toil,\nAwaken to the heart’s true light—\nSoaring on winds, wild clouds gathered in.\nMountains still, the **Taixu** vast and empty,\nStars and moon illuminating **Yingzhou**.\nTruly bliss—\nUnbounded joy, no envy of kings.\n\n---\n*[The Sleep Demon King]*\nA hundred harms he brings, a thousand calamities.\nBy day, he still may lurk—\nBy night, no place to hide.\nHe vexes men to stupor, drunk as fools,\nUndermines practice, squanders life’s brief span.\nEyes glued shut, head crushed like a mountain’s weight,\nA fog of dullness, frail and weak.\nHe lures the **Three Corpses, Six Bandits**,\nSteals **yuanqi** in dreams’ embrace.\nEndless his tricks—\nSoaring through **Dharmadhatu**, wild and mad.\nThus, without cause, so perverse—\nI urge all: guard yourselves with care.\nMind death’s path, the great affair ahead—\nProtect the **Three Lights** with earnestness.\nNo leaning on others—\nAwakening alone, fierce as **Guan Yu and Zhang Fei**.\nThey clash in battle,\nSharp as blades, unyielding—\nOne mind presses forward.\nChased away, clouds disperse, mists fade,\nCool and clear.\n\n---\n**Ma Dan yang** swears this oath,\nBurning the vow in solemn pledge.\nFirst, uphold the law of the land.\nSeeing men and women, parents alike,\nI renounce **qi, wealth, wine, and lust**,\nAbandon glory, shun the tainted.\nEver pure, ever humble, reverent,\nNo factions, no bias.\nIn coarse robes, I beg my daily bread,\nHunger and cold—then stretch my hand in the street.\nNo greed for wealth, no boastful lies,\nNo feigning wisdom as a fraud.\nAlways mind the end as the beginning,\nIn peril, stand firm.\nShould I stray from the Dao,\nMay my body split a thousand times,\nForever sunk in **Yellow Springs**.\n\n---\n*[For the Practitioner]*\nThe Daoist does not dwell in mountains,\nNor toil in endless rounds of **kneeling and bowing**.\nWhy cling to petty comings and goings,\nFar journeys to seek the master?\nNo need for seated meditation,\nNor laboring, planting for food.\nNo need for bitter herbs,\nTo trade for robes and rice.\nWhere do you fix your mind?\nOnly this: no trace of defilement—\nBreak free from all such bonds.\nBetter to beg in the marketplace,\nGathering scraps and leftovers.\nAsking after hollow fame and gain—\nSigh, death’s shadow darkens the heart.\nForgotten dust, forgotten thoughts—\nLet future ranks among immortals be.\n---\n*[Shu Kui Flower]*\n---\n**Wang

apart.\n---\n*[The Five Volumes of the Crane’s Cry]* ends here.\n\n---\n*The Daoist Realm: [The Gathering from Panxi]*\n*[Shu Kui Flower]* is rendered as *\"Fine Grass and Mustard Seed\"* in the original.\n\nThis poem is likely a **zaju** [散曲 *zǎnqǔ*—a form of Chinese dramatic song, often secular], though its meter requires further study.\n\nThe following six **yuefu** [词 *cí*—lyric poems] under the title *\"Phoenix Nesting in the Willow\"* [凤栖梧 *Fèng Qī Wú*]:\nWith the exception of the second poem, which appears in *The Poems of Master Yǔchán* [玉蟾先生诗余 *Yùchuán Xiānsheng Shīyú*],\nthe remaining five are attributed to **Qiu Chúji** [丘处机 *Qiū Chǔjī*—a prominent figure in the **Quanzhen** *全真* **Daoist school**], also found in *The Gathering from Panxi* [磻溪集 *Pánxī Jí*] and *The Journey to the West* [西游记 *Xīyóu Jì*].\n\nThe original misattributed the **yuefu** title as *\"Nán Xiāngzǐ\"* [南香子 *Nán Xiāngzǐ*—a Southern tune], but it should be the **Southern tune double-meter** *\"Xíng Xiāngzǐ\"* [行香子 *Xíng Xiāngzǐ*—*Walking in Fragrance*].\n\nThe original lacks an author’s signature, but this poem also appears in *The Complete Quanzhen Lyrics of Zhòngyáng* [重阳全真集 *Zhòngyáng Quánzhēn Jí*] Volume Five.\n\nThe original lacks an author’s signature. The following four poems—all under the title *\"Water Dragon’s Roar\"* [水龙吟 *Shuǐlóngyín*],—are also found in *The Gathering from Panxi* and are by **Qiu Chúji**.\n\nIn *The Gathering from Panxi*, these three lines read:\n*\"Táng Cháo Hànshì, Qín Guān Zhōu Yuàn, Míngmíng Jiàn Gào\"* [唐朝汉市，秦官周苑，明明见告].\n---\n*[Crane’s Cry Remaining Echoes]* concludes here.\n---\n*The Sixth Volume of Daoist Play at Xiānyóu Shān*\nCollected by **Daoist Master Péng Zhìzhōng** [仙游山道士彭致中 *Xiānyóu Shān Dàoshì Péng Zhìzhōng*] of **Xiānyóu Shān**.\n\n**Eight Modes of *Gānzhōu* [甘州]**\n*(Attributed to Hé Xiāngū [何仙姑])*\n\nThousands of gates and halls—\nAll toppled seven times eight,\nDigging earth to seek the sky.\nTruly wondrous, yet reduced to childish babble.\nThe Daoist of Non-Action walks few paths,\nYet along the way of strange encounters,\nA thousand sorrows accumulate.\nThe dung-beetle’s ball becomes an elixir.\nHelpless in grief, yet none know the cause—\nIn vain, family ties are cast aside.\nTime is pure and still—\nHow could it grasp the alchemy of mercury and lead?\nThoughts and schemes never cease—\nEven in sleep, the shadow-demons cling.\nThe more one turns, the deeper the sorrow—\nRevenge becomes the cycle.\nWho would believe in the birth of nothingness,\nAnd nothingness giving rise to all?\nAll streams return to their source.\n\n---\n**The Second [Section]**\nA cluster of spring snow,\nCast into a jade furnace to boil.\nFires blaze without ceasing—\nBurn until it glows red, without flame or smoke.\nMindful not to lose a grain—\nThe weight remains unchanged.\nThus, three thousand [times].\nOnly when refined to immobility,\nCan it be called Zen.\nNurturing True Life lies here—\nBetween these very breaths.\nThe garden holds its own sweet dew.\nTo nourish the golden sprout,\nThat the rare lotus may bloom.\nIn seclusion, await the coming—\nTo stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Immortals.\n\n---\n**Treading Snow [踏雪行]**\nPiercing antiquity, mastering the present,\nClarifying scripture, resolving meaning.\nEndless debates make the heavens fall.\nChasing painted bread to sate hunger—\nBamboo shadows cannot sweep the hall’s dust.\nFew desires, few thoughts—\nSilent joy, beyond words.\nAll schools struggle to let go—\nIf one departs from this inch of mind,\nEven iron shoes would be trod to no avail.\n\n---\n**Willow Leaf Green [柳梢青]**\nFaintly, the morning star flickers.\nWhite dew on withered moss,\nRuined walls of an ancient site—\nPale smoke, fading grass,\nThe Han dynasty’s palaces.\nOn Chang’an’s thoroughfare, travelers still\nPursue fame and profit as before.\nYouth fades, ancient and modern alike—\nA sliver of moon over the pass.\n\n---\n**The Second [Section]**\nAwakening to neither birth nor death—\nNot even a flower plucked, a leaf taken.\nWhen inspired, sing aloud,\nDrunkenly sleep on fragrant grass,\nDreaming of celestial halls.\nSometimes, bitterly admonishing all—\nDo not, I implore you, heed my warnings.\nWalking like a hollow corpse,\nGreed turns the face ashen—\nWasting years in vain.\n\n---\n**Plum Blossom Tune [梅花引]**\nOld Master of the Fragrant Peaks,\nGrew white-haired early.\nIn mortal life, both good and evil were wrought.\nPoverty and wealth—both known.\nGain and loss, rise and fall—\nAll like a dream within a dream.\nBecause of poverty, the body bears no shame;\nBecause of leisure, the heart knows no burden.\nDo not seek high talent,\nDo not seek high name.\nTalent and fame bring only laborious turns.\nKnow little of affairs—\nFewer are the vexations.\nWhen the heart forgets and the belly burns—\nWhen will this end?\nDo not lift the eyes,\nDo not open the mouth.\nEndless strife—\nHow can one escape it?\nComing alone, going alone, no companion.\nPouring alone, drinking alone—\nNo honor, no disgrace.\nLet others slander, let others suspect.\nA tranquil heart knows\nThe clear wind and bright moon.\n\n---\n**Gazing at the Plum Blossom [望梅花]**\nLife and death are the greatest trials of the self.\nFrom the start, they have harmed me.\n\n**Hunger drives me to seek food,\nThirst compels me to beg for drink,\nCold brings me to search for robes and coverings—\nHow hard it is to endure!\nDay and night they follow me,\nPlaguing me beyond measure.\n\nAbandoning my mother-given fleshly vessel,\nI entrust myself to the care of the two families of ease.\nWhen I walk, I pierce the clouds;\nWhen weary, I rest beneath the moon,\nPlaying freely in the boundless void—\nHow light and swift!\n\nSeizing the wind-wheel,\nStraddling the divine tortoise,\nI traverse all realms without hindrance.\n\n**Second Stanza:**\nCease debating right and wrong—\nThe weak will see their truth in time.\nDo not blame others,\nNor deceive yourself—\nThe hidden sage reveals himself.\nHear my counsel:\nFrom ancient times to now,\nNot a single thing has been spared.\nSweep away the dust of entanglements—\nPure and unchanging from beginning to end.\nThough rooted deep,\nLong life and eternal vision\nCannot escape the fleeting beauty of youth.\nRefine qi and spirit—\nWhen you meet a kindred soul,\nShare the mysteries of the *Xi Yi*—\nReveal all.\n\n**Third Stanza:**\nThick crimson clouds shroud the earth.\nA gusting wind from the north arises—\nThe Great Block breathes,\nYang congeals, yin coalesces,\nAnd jade flowers bloom across the four wilds in omens.\nSuch intentions—\nThe sage feels the abundance of the year,\nManifesting the Tang and Yu eras once more,\nA world restored to order.\nReverence the Dao, honor Confucius, cultivate righteousness,\nCherish the Three Teachings as one body.\nFilial sons and virtuous grandsons,\nLoyal ministers and upright courts—\nHarmony flows from top to bottom.\nWithin the sacred cauldron,\nIncense burns bright,\nPraying for the emperor’s longevity—\nMay his reign last ten thousand years.\n\n**Fourth Stanza:**\nThe sun lingers at the southern window,\nStill I sleep.\n\n**Fifth Stanza:**\nBeyond the sparse bamboo grove, the thatched gate stays shut.\nSuddenly, someone arrives—\nLightly knocking at the door,\nI barely turn, too lazy to rise.\nJust as sweetness deepens—\nA taste so dark and intoxicating,\nAsking in the world—\nWhat could compare?\nOnly deep, drunken oblivion\nForgets the startling fear,\nForgets the fall—\nNeither rising nor falling known,\nLife and death alike,\nOne with heaven and earth.\nSuch meaning—\nHard to grasp,\nYet like a mute solving a riddle.\n\n**Sixth Stanza:**\nDo not judge others’ flaws.\nSearch your own faults,\nLest you stir chaos yourself.\nThe old heart-monkey,\nThe wild intent-horse—\nNow awakened,\nGradually tamed by restraint.\nStill the mind within,\nRefining to purity and balance,\nTransforming the mortal frame.\nWhen matters arise, decide swiftly—\nEven immortals have no other method.\nThrough ages unending,\nWith an empty heart and full belly,\nThe wise strategist needs no calculations.\nWhen merit is complete,\nRiding a cloud of blessing,\nYou ascend to the Celestial Court,\nDwelling in the Hall of the Immortal.\n\n**Seventh Stanza:**\nA hundred years of youth pass like lightning.\nIn vain to look back—\nAnother cycle comes.\nSelling bones for return,\nThrough countless lives and deaths,\nOnly changing faces.\nTo escape—\nSeize the clear wind,\nTurning the void into a single expanse.\nNo need to chant the *Chuang-tzu* scriptures,\nNor cling to entanglements.\nSever the midstream,\nPierce the heart’s core,\nShooting through jade halls and golden palaces.\nDo not falter—\nWith unwavering resolve,\nWatch as the moon rises over the peaks.\nThe needle stops—\n*Sanfeng*’s True Person says the Dao is hard to speak.\nTo awaken, understand each layer,\nUntil all is clear.\n\n**Continuation:**\n\nPierce through with luminous clarity,\nReturning radiance to its source—\nNo need to pluck flowers or leaves.\nMovement spawns distinction.\nCease all grasping thoughts,\nLest tangled branches grow.\nIn its original form,\nPure and unadorned,\nWhat need for words?\n\nOnly fierce resolve will suffice.\nWith wisdom’s blade drawn,\nCut like iron—unrelenting.\nShatter the mountain of affection,\nLeap from the sea of love,\nBreak the void’s false repose.\n\nQi and spirit rejoice.\nCultivate the Nine Suns,\nRefining into crimson snow.\nWrapped in rainbow hues,\nA single offering—\nA moon of pristine whiteness.\n\n**Acclamation to the Sacred Reign#1**\n*(Attributed to Qiu Changchun)*\n\nWhen the sun sinks low,\nThe plains gather its last glow,\nThe willow locks in cold mist.\nFacing the southern stream,\nAlone I sit, drifting with the wind’s breath,\nListening to the cascading spring.\nThrough endless night,\nForgetting all affairs,\nMy idle nature hums—\nThe zither plays without strings.\n\nAwait the time when the Azure Crow descends from the clouds,\nTo prove the earthly immortal’s truth.\n\n**Second Stanza:**\nAfter the wild monk departs,\nThe fisherman’s boat ties to shore,\nGreen pines rise in mist.\nBefore the cold lamp’s flicker,\nI toss aside books and sleep,\nListening to the stones rinse the spring.\nThe alchemical furnace cools,\nThe zither hall falls silent—\nThe wind-tunes the strings.\n\nAwait the moment when the lone peak’s moon shines bright,\nWhen the Zhengyi adept dreams of transcendence.\n\n**Song of the Incense Offering**\nSilent, boundless, vast—#2\n\n**First Stanza:**\nWine spills in a light drizzle.\nA faint life—\nOne taste of unbounded ease.\nBeside the valley’s mouth,\nLeaning askew on the mountain’s flank.\nA bamboo fence gates the door,\nA broom of wild jasmine,\nA grass wad for a marker.\nA coarse hemp robe, loose and wide,\nIts sash long and trailing.\nA gnarled staff—\nA curved vine’s tip.\nGoji berries self-boiled,\nAtractylodes brewed by hand.\nA clay teapot, a sand-stove hearth,\nA gourd ladle, a wooden dipper.\n\n**Second Stanza #3:**\nThe Celestial Gardens, the Penglai Isles,\nJin Valley’s towering halls—\nYet none compare\nTo this thatched hut’s quiet grace.\nWildflowers embroider the earth—\nNo need for artificial charm.\nSpring suits it well,\nSo does summer, so does autumn.\nWhen the wine is ripe, it’s worth toasting.\nWhen guests arrive, they must be kept.\nNo glory, no shame, no care—\nRetreat one step further,\nWhat matter the reasons?\nOnly when weary, sleep;\nWhen thirsty, drink;\nWhen drunk, sing.\n\n**Third Stanza:**\nA low, crooked wall,\nA squat, sparse window.\nA monk’s boy#4 by a tiny pond.\nLayered screens rise high and low,\nBeside the green water’s edge.\nYet there are breezes,\nThere are moons,\nThere are coolnesses.\nDaily life is simple:\nA wooden table, a vine bed.\nBefore my eyes—\nWater’s hue, mountain’s light.\nGuests come without wine,\nYet words of heart may still flow.\nOnly then—\nJade-warmed tea steeped,\nA steaming cup,\nA shallow bowl of broth.\n\n**Fourth Stanza:**\nSwept clean of dust,\nSpared the creeping moss.\nLet red leaves\nPile the threshold before me.\nWorthy of a painting—\nTruly strange and wondrous.\nA few pine trees,\nA few bamboo stalks,\nA few plum branches.\nNurture the flowers and wood,\nLet them bloom in turn.\nTomorrow’s matters—\nLet Heaven arrange them.\nWho knows when wealth and honor may come?\nI but drift, content,\nLive as fate allows,\nAnd keep my heart at ease.\n\n---\n**Alchemical Pill (Roll of Gold Elixir) – Yang Zhēnrén**\n\n**First Pill (First Watch):**\nWrap in one layer,\nTame the

turtles.\nEmerging from the billows,\nI gather the elixir of longevity.\n*\"Nánxiāng Zǐ\"*:\nTrue mercury with true lead,\nBorn in the Primordial and Post-Heaven realms.\nWhen the time is known, pluck and gather with diligence—\nThe Mysterious Mystery.\nIf the acupoint is lost, why fret?\nTo become a transcendent, no need.\nThe fire must be refined and unwavering,\nExamining the *qiàn* before and after.\nFrom *Lián* (屯) I draw, and in *Méng* (蒙) I cease—\nHard to teach.\nA single hair’s misstep will not yield the elixir.\n\n**The Second [Poem]:**\nWith both hands, I split the *Hóngméng* [cosmic egg].\nThe wisdom-sword flies forth to the first peak.\nOuter Daoists and *xiūluó* [demonic beings] are startled, their necks drawn tight—\nDivine powers.\nThe transformation was always within my grasp.\nI forge the *yù* [jade] and *hú* [fire] in the alchemical furnace—red.\nThe *qí* [key] and *suǒ* [lock] are blown by the *xùn* [conforming] wind.\nIn the tenth month, I shed my form and swallow it within—\n*Kūn* [Earth] Palace:\nInstantly, the Three Pure Ones and the Grandest Ancestor appear.\n\n**The Third [Poem]:**\nI nurture the *xiàng* [form] through the *Zhōutiān* [Cosmic Cycle].\nThe fire must be gentle yet complete.\nTo cherish the infant, only the mother’s care suffices—\nThree years.\nI apply and refine the *xiàng* [form], drawing and adding as it wanes and returns.\nAt the confluence of the *Niúdǒu* [Big Dipper] and the River,\nI abandon and take the Mysterious Pearl to sow the Jade Field.\nMy resolve is steady as I govern the fire’s stages—\nRefined and unwavering.\nI split the abdomen clearly and explain it to the worthy.\n\n**The Fourth [Poem]:**\nLife’s *jiǎ* [first stage] gives way to its *gēng* [second stage].\nThis is the elixir’s kernel—clearly mark it.\nGather the tender herbs and return them to the earthen pot—\nTo simmer and refine.\nYield and hardness, strength and softness, proceed in order.\nA single dose will yield the elixir.\nBathing and guarding against peril, I hold fast to the city.\nHere, no need to govern the fire’s stages—\nHold the fullness.\nIf fire is added, it will surely topple.\n\n**The Fifth [Poem]:**\nCarve and wrap the effort—uniformly applied.\nWith earnest study, probe the elixir’s every detail,\nNot a hair’s breadth overlooked.\nTen months of diligent self-preservation.\n\n**The Sixth [Poem]:**\nThe Cauldron’s method mirrors Heaven and Earth—\nAbove, the Celestial Primordium; below, the Terrestrial.\nIf one can reverse and invert their operation,\nAlternating and exchanging,\nOpening and closing cycle through the Eight Gates,\nLifting to Kunlun’s heights.\nThe Tortoise and Serpent brothers spit and swallow.\nAt the hundred-foot pole’s peak, grip the line tight—\nLift and surge.\nFrom here, the Original Spirit and life endure forever.\n\n**The Seventh [Poem]:**\nThe Passages lock within the Microcosmic Orbit.\nAscending and descending cycle through the Three-Inch Field.\nNot in exhaling, inhaling, or counting breaths—\nIt is natural.\nNine transformations without loss, fire’s power complete.\nFetal breathing is but idle talk.\nThe key lies in balancing yin and yang—\nNo deviation.\nAll breathing, blowing, and exhaling rely on the Gentle Wind,\nSoft and enduring.\nThe marvel lies in the fore-strand and the after-strand.\n\n**The Eighth [Poem]:**\nThe *Kàn* [Returning] hexagram rises with the Hidden Dragon.\nStealthily adjust *wu-jǐ* [the fifth and sixth stems]—\nDo not yet assault.\nAt the second line, the Dragon appears, mastering the hexagram,\nDivine efficacy.\nFrom here, the furnace’s stages turn crimson in order.\nThe *Tài* [Peace] hexagram meets again.\nFierce fire burns *qián* [the creative], aided by the Gentle Wind.\nRefined, the Yellow Sprout and White Snow emerge—\nExtraordinary achievement.\nReturning, it follows the *Kūn* [Earth] path to completion.\n\n**The Ninth [Poem]:**\nRecognize the Metal within Water.\nSmelting and refining deepen its essence.\nAdvance and retreat, drawing the sacrificial—\nNine transformations, floating and sinking.\nNurture the Hidden Dragon, then let it ascend.\nMarvelous operation from the Heavenly Heart.\nRelying on the Yellow Nurse—*bǐng-rén* [the third and ninth stems]—\nFerment the cream, descending from the mountain peak,\nPouring again and again.\nSlowly plucking the stringless lute’s single note.\n\n**The Tenth [Poem]:**\nThe eldest son proceeds to the Western Quarter.\nThe maiden returns to *Kūn* [Earth], transforming into six *yáng* [male/positive] lines.\nThen it is time to apply effort and cultivate the *Èr-Bā* [Two-Eight, i.e., the Eight Trigrams].\nFortify the banks.\n\nFrom the Nine Quarters, the Dao/Way itself flourishes.\nThe Bull and Dipper constellations deliberate together.\nArtistry surpasses Heaven’s craft—wonder beyond compare.\nThe High *Kàn* [Abyss] and its spouse consummate their union;\nHard to forget.\n\nOnly now does one perceive the *Hú* [Caulron]’s eternal sun and moon.\n\n**The Eleventh [Poem]:**\nWhite Snow and Yellow Sprout—\nTwo refined essences of the same luminous family.\nPlucking and selecting, discerning decline and vigor,\nWorthy of praise.\n\nNot a hair’s breadth may the fire’s intensity vary.\nAt the summit, the Three Flowers bloom.\nThe Ram Chariot and Deer Chariot move in harmony.\nThe Hare and Tortoise pass between the South and North,\nTheir interplay ceaseless.\n\nFrom here, the Heavenly River stirs with steady oars.\n\n**The Twelfth [Poem]:**\nPurity complete, revealing Heaven’s design.\nOnly fear that contemporaries remain lost in delusion.\nThe pearl beneath the chin must be seized with vigor—\nDo not delay.\n\nThe Dao/Way lies within the body—\nWho else could question it?\nCast off the dust-net swiftly.\nA hundred years of life, yet seven [critical] moments are rare.\nDo not wait until old age when lead and mercury dwindle—\nWorthy of lament.\n\nKarmic retribution’s path is hard to deceive oneself.\nAn inch of gold—\nWorthy of sighing over the multitude of deluded ones,\nHow few awaken to the dream’s empty blossoms.\n\n「Yet adorned with embroidered brocade curtains and copper peaks,\nWith crimson shoes and jade hairpins—\nWhat use are they to the body in the end?\n\nBetter than the dusty world,\nAre secluded bamboo fences and humble cottages.\nBeneath the green pines,\nA single verse of lofty song—\nLaughing defiantly as the years transform into ages.\n\n**The Realm of the Purple Palace,**\nSpring’s light pure,\nWhen the refined gather—\nWondrous existence, true delight.\nSee the natural celestial music,\nStar towers and moon palaces,\nCranes soaring, phoenixes dancing.\n\nIn the depths of white clouds,\nWithin the wine cup—\nA landscape of divine immortals.\nWho would willingly turn back to youth?\n\n**The Realm of Effortless Wandering,**\nOnly I return,\nThen re-enter the boundless void of **Leiyang**.*\n\n**The Second [Poem]:**\n**Appreciating Snow**\n\nThe evening wild geese cry mournfully,\nAnd the late earthly hums echo—\nCold winds arise together.\nFrost forms with severity,\nDark clouds gather uniformly—\nThe Four Seas display the auspicious jade dragon.\n\nSnowflakes dot a thousand households with pristine beauty,\nIce blossoms unfold in radiant splendor.\nThe finest moment is when,\nInviting poetic companions,\nWe surround the brazier with paper screens, lost in intoxication.\n\nReciting,\nWe seek exquisite verses—\nOutside the bamboo, a fresh fragrance;\nGolden threads spurt new buds.\n\nLike scattered silver grains,\nOr powdered butterflies,\nFlitting high and low in empty embrace.\nIt is known that this is a sign of great peace,\nA premonition of **Yin-Yang** harmony.\n\nThis profound truth,\nWhen shared with a kindred spirit like **Zi You**,\nReveals the genuine flavor of the rivers and skies.\n\n**The Seventh Movement of the *Wuling* Series concludes.**\n#1 The following nineteen pieces are all **danci** (散曲小令).\n#2 The following nine pieces are all **danci** (散曲小令).\n#3 The following twenty-five pieces are all **danci** (散曲小令).\n\n**The Eighth Movement of the *Wuling* Series:**\n*Siming at Xianyou Mountain by Daoist Priest Peng Zhizhong*\n\n**Western River Moon #1**\n**[Attributed to Zhang Boduan]**」\n\n**#1**\nInner elixirs are like outer elixirs—\nInner must harmonize with outer.\nThe cinnabar essence blends as kindred does.\nNourishing warmth works in myriad ways.\nWithin lies natural celestial fire,\nFlame-red and blazing in the furnace.\nThe outer furnace’s fuel must be adjusted with diligence.\nNo art surpasses the true seed.\n\n**#2**\nThis Dao is most divine and sacred,\nYet its weight for rulers is light—hard to dispel.\nRefining lead and mercury takes more than a morning.\nEarly glimpse the black pearl’s omen.\nIf worthy men would cultivate,\nWhy dwell in markets or courtly halls?\nThe practice is simple, though the elixir is not distant.\nSpeak of it, and men will laugh in scorn.\n\n**#3**\nThe White Tiger’s essence is supreme treasure,\nThe divine pool’s waters—true gold refined.\nThus, the highest virtue’s source runs deep.\nNot like common medicines.\nTo forge the Nine Transformations,\nFirst refine the self and steady the mind.\nTake at the proper time—let not float or sink.\nIncrease the fire, but guard against peril.\n\n**#4**\nSeven returns of cinnabar restore its root,\nNine returns of golden liquid restore its truth.\nDo not fixate on the hours of *Yin* and *Yang* or *Kun* and *Shen*.\nObserve the Five Phases for measure.\nIt is but mercury in essence,\nCirculating through all celestial phases.\nWhen *Yin* and *Yang* qi are full, it naturally becomes numinous.\nIts emergence and retreat never leave the Mysterious Female.\n\n**#5**\nTo retain true lead and bind mercury,\nThe inner minister never strays from home.\nWood and metal, though separated, meet without cause—\nThey need the Yellow Matchmaker’s aid.\nWood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,\nMetal’s passion clings to wood’s benevolence.\nDevouring, consuming, yet ever close—\nOnly then does the man bear fruit.\n\n**#6**\nWhich household’s maiden of twenty-eight,\nWhich lord of thirty-nine?\nThey call themselves Wood Elixir and Metal Essence—\nOnly when they meet the Earth do they form the Three Families.\nFurther refined by Master Ding’s tempering,\nThen husband and wife at last unite in joy.\nThe River Chariot dares not pause,\nCarried to Kunlun’s peak.\n\n**#7**\nThe love of Ox and Girl aligns with the Dao,\nTortoise and Serpent share their natural kindred.\nThe Toad and Crow meet at the New Moon’s brilliance,\nTheir two *qi* intermingle in motion.\nAll is the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth—\nWho can fathom this profound abyss?\nWhen *Yin* and *Yang* are severed, fault arises.\nHow could one endure Heaven’s length and Earth’s span?\n\n**#8**\nThe Male encloses the Female within,\nBearing *Yin* while embracing *Yang* essence.\nThe two combine—medicine is complete.\nRefining soul and spirit to their finest.\nTruly, one grain of Golden Elixir—\nWhen the serpent swallows, it becomes a dragon.\nEven chicken feed transforms into phoenix and *peng*.\nSoaring into the True Realm of Azure Yang.\n\n**#9**\nHeaven and Earth have just passed through *Pi* and *Tai*—\nMorning and evening, recognize *Lún* and *Méng*.\nRadiating wheels converge at the hub, water pays homage to the center.\nThe marvel lies in adding and subtracting with precision.\nGain one, and all things are accomplished—\nNo need to distinguish east, west, south, or north.\nDiminish again, and guard against undoing past efforts.\nTreasure life—do not trifle with it lightly.\n\n**#10**\nAt Winter Solstice, *Yin* returns to *Yang*’s rebirth,\nThree decades add one *Yang* line.\nMidmonth, the *Gua* reverses at dawn’s first light.\nAfter the full moon, *Kàn* ends—stains appear.\nDays further divide into cold and heat,\n*Yang* rises again in midnight’s hour.\nAt noon, the *Guà* symbol—one *Yin* ascends.\nRefining elixir must know dawn and dusk.\n\n**#11**\nVirtue cultivated beyond eight hundred,\n*Yin* merit accumulated to three thousand.\n\n「The harmonious balance of things unites me with kin and grievance.\nAt first, the aspiration for immortality and divine beings was kindled.\nTigers and rhinoceroses, blades and armies do not harm,\nYet the fleeting fire of the mortal abode cannot be constrained.\n\nA precious talisman descends—leaving courtly service behind,\nSteadily riding the *luan* carriage and *feng* palanquin.\n\n**#12**\nWithout discerning the Five *Xing* and Four *Xiang*,\nOne does not distinguish cinnabar (*zhu*), mercury (*gong*), lead, or silver.\nThe methods of refining the elixir’s fire are unheard of,\nYet early on, one is hailed as a recluse (*juyin*).\n\nUnwilling to reflect on one’s own errors,\nOne further misleads others with false teachings.\nFearful that others remain lost in the *Mijin* (crossing of delusion) for eternal ages,\nOne endures deceit with a hardened heart.\n\n**#13**\nThe elixir is the supreme treasure of the colored body (*seshin*),\nRefined, its transformations are boundless.\nIt can further ascend to explore the true *Zong* (essence),\nUnraveling the wondrous use of non-birth (*wusheng*).\nNo need to rely on another’s merit in future ages—\nDivine powers are gained in this very life.\n\nSince the Dragon Maiden (*Longnü*) undertook this labor,\nWho afterward could follow in her footsteps?\n\n**#14**\n*(Attributed to Xiao Tingzhi)*\nWith two hands, one cleaves apart the *Hun* (chaos),\nRevealing the Dao/Way of refining the elixir plainly.\nThe *rihun* (solar essence) and *yuepo* (lunar spirit) move from west to east,\nSeize them firmly—do not let them slip away.\nOuter *Dao/Way* and heretical *mo* (demons) shrink in fear,\nAll vying to bind treasure within the inner palace (*zhonggong*).\nThe Nine *Huan* and Seven *Fan* (alchemical cycles) are achieved in an instant,\nYet all depend on the Yellow Woman (*Huangpo*)’s guidance.\n\n**#15**\nSilently harnessing the *buqian* (mysterious transformations) of *Yin* and *Yang*,\nThe marvel lies in the precision of adding and subtracting—\nFound in the convergence of *Tun* and *Meng* (trigram symbols).」\n\n**#16**\nTo recognize the true *qian* (lead) and true *gong* (mercury),\nAll derived from a single root source.\nThe alchemical *fire* (huǒ) and timing are profound in their mystery—\nOnly the true adept can discern them.\n\nWhen gathering, do not err in season or day,\nStill distinguish the *hai* (posterior) from the *xian* (anterior).\nIn the *jinyu* (jade furnace), a moment’s heat sears the heavens,\nThe *Dao/Way*’s person (*Zhenren*) appears without rank.\n\n**#17**\nDo not ask of the *Nine* (9) and *Three* (3), nor the *Two* (2) and *Eight* (8),\nFor there is no excess in *Yin*’s even or *Yang*’s odd.\nMostly, high *Kan* (water) and low *Gen* (mountain) form the union.\nRecognize *Tun* and *Meng*—they are the key.\n\nIf you pass the first *Yang* (male) ascent,\nThen you may advance the fire without delay.\nFor the slightest misstep lies in the hairsbreadth,\nAnd reckless *wild alchemy* (*yèzhàn*) demands precision.\n\n**#18**\nThe *ding* (cauldron) and *qi* (vessel) follow the *Tian* (Heaven) and *Di* (Earth) symbols,\n*Kan* (water) and *Li* (fire) in operation show no deviation.\nThe *husband* and *wife* meet in the *Huang* (Yellow) household,\nSpeaking of the *wu sheng* (non-born) marvels.\n\nRain’s intent and clouds’ emotions are fully understood,\nAt the *Ling* (peak) head, the *jia* (vehicle) is urged forward.\nReturning to the summit, the *Nine* and *Three* bloom—\nSeal the *jinyuan* (jade gate) with *golden locks* (*jīnsuǒ*).\n\n**#19**\nStirring the *top* (dǐng) and *gate* (mén) closures,\nThe tiger roars and dragon hums naturally.\nThe *Nine* return and *Seven* return—profound in meaning,\nEntering and exiting never stray from the *mystic female* (*Xuǎnpìn*).\n\nUsing the *jinyu* (jade furnace) at the right *fire* (huǒ) moment,\nTrue *gold* (*zhenjīn*) is refined within the cauldron.\nWhen the *qi* (vital force) is strong and the battle won,\nThe secret lies in no harm, no loss.\n\n**#20**\n\n**#21**\nReturning twice to nourish the *fire* (yǎnghuǒ),\nThe rabbit and rooster bathe in concealment.\nThe clear transformations manifest at the center,\nThe *playing pearl* (xuánzhū) is sealed and refined.\n\n**#22**\nPressing between the *spine* (jiājǐ) and dual *gates*,\nPiercing to the *top* (dǐng)—this is the **Great Dao’s Mystic Portal** (*Dàdào Xuánmén*).\nThe *golden elixir* (jīndān) is but this **School’s Root-Power** (*zōnggēn lìdà yào*).\nKnow the moment to stir and transport it.\nNurturing warmth, defending the *city* (*shòuchéng*), and wild battles,\nFrequently ingesting the *flowering pool’s* (huāchí) *jade nectar* (yùyè).\nAlways use the *jade furnace* (yùlú) with gentle, warming *fire* (huǒ).\nGather herbs, discerning their maturity—whether aged or tender.\n\n**#23**\nThe *Nine Oils* (jiǔyóu) surge upward against the tide,\nIn an instant, they rush past the *Heavenly Heart* (*Tiānxīn*).\nOn Kunlun’s peak, the waters are pure and clear—\nFermenting the *celestial fluid* (qióngjiāng) for self-nourishment.\nAt this very moment, begin to gather and refine,\nThe *River Vehicle* (héchē) transports without pause.\nThe *One Qi* (*yīqì*) of *Yin-Yang* is naturally captured and sunk.\nSeal the *jade gate* (yùguān) with steadfast locks.\n\n**#24**\nThe *medicine* (yào) is born in the southwest *Kun* (earthly branch) land,\nThe *golden elixir* (jīndān) is its true root-school.\nStudents must diligently ponder and exhaust its depths—\nIts marvel surpasses all, unmatched by true essence.\n\n**#25**\nThe Great Dao of *Golden Elixir* (jīnyè huándān) is the ancient path,\nTransmitted through eons by the sages of old.\nWith bared heart and split belly, their scrolls are revealed—\nGuiding souls beyond the Dao’s shore.\nDo not marvel at the heavens’ secrets being laid bare,\nFor beyond the *Play of Mysteries* (Xuánxuán), there is no deeper mystery.\nLeft to the ancients and the worthy of name—\nThose with ears shall clearly perceive.\n\n**#26**\nA full stomach harms the heart and depletes the *qi*,\nExcessive sleep entangles one in dreams, obscuring the True.\nWhen the eyes move, the spirit is lost; when the ears listen, the *Lingtai* (spiritual platform) grows dim.\nTo behold the Original Face, wield the *wisdom-blade* to sever the red dust.\nUnfeeling response to things is the natural truth—\nThis is the swiftest path of cultivation.\n\n**#27**\nSudden enlightenment reveals the Dao’s principles:\nBanish desire, conquer sleep, and subdue the demonic foes.\nAvoiding fame and gain, one faces fewer storms.\nLaziness and drift pass as one follows fate.\nHunger drives one to beg for scraps in the streets,\nWhile satiety invites aimless wandering.\nIn leisure, one sings at ancient temples—\nWho else roams so freely as I?\n\n**#28**\nWealth and honor cannot enter me, nor does poverty trouble me.\nWith fate and destiny, disputes arise—\nYet without fortune or misfortune, there is no calamity.\nLet them indulge in extravagance, for even a gourd and bowl sustain life.\nI counsel you not to labor in vain—\nWhen the Great Limit arrives, how can one flee?\n\n**#29**\nFirst, do not slight the teacher nor disregard the method.\nSecond, recite the pure *Immortal Scriptures* (xiānjīng).\nThird, preserve the True *qi* to nourish the spirit.\nFourth, sweep away all dust and toil.\nFifth, sever the darkness of ignorance’s fire,\nSixth, cast off the shackles of worldly emotions.\nSeventh, tame the *monkey* and *horse*—eternal peace follows.\nEighth, drink the *Eight Immortals’ Elixir* (bāxiān zhēng).\n\n*Yǒngyùlè* (Joy of Eternity):\nAll cultivate, all swallow—who grasps the True Dao?\nCrooked paths and minor methods mislead many.\nRóngchéng was no immortal—his herb-gathering was in vain.\nOne day, stripped from the vat’s depths, his nature crumbles.\nBetter to turn inward, embrace *wuwei* (non-action), and study the original *Zhuāngzi-Laozi*.\nAlign *Yin-Yang*, refine *lead* and *mercury*—the *Eight Trigrams* mark the foundation.\nLife is a dream, years like arrows—turn back while you may.\nClinging to spring flowers and autumn moons—when will it end?\n\n**Part Two**\nAll *dharma* arises from the heart; observe the *Dharmadhātu* (Law-realm)—all is mind-made.\nBuddha and Dao converge; measure not, yet never depart—\nThe heart itself is the Way.\nSince knowing *Kàn* and *Lí* (water and fire),\nMixing and refining elixirs, one dimly grasps dawn and dusk.\nSee the rooster fly to the *Tianhuang* (Heavenly Palace),\nThe hare race across the *Danque* (Elixir Gate)—no more affliction.\nWithin the *qi*, the True Fluid; within the Fluid, the True *qi*—\nHarmonized, neither too much nor too little.\nSowing the yellow sprout, refining into red water,\nThe *Dragon* and *Tiger* entwine in their embrace.\nNine returns, seven refineries—when the work is complete,\nI reclaim my youth of old.\nAwait the three thousand cycles,\nWhen merit is fulfilled and the path is round—\nThen it is done.\n\n**Part Three**\nCultivate the Dao, preserve the heart, refine the spirit—\nLightness must be the aim.\nRestore the marrow, return the essence—\nFlowing water does not rot, the door-hinge never decays.\nThe *sun-soul* and *moon-shadow* reunite in the furnace—\nTrue *qi* gathers naturally.\nTame the heart-monkey, recall the mind-horse—\nNo trace of dust remains.\nWithin stillness, clarity emerges—\nWhen *Yang Dragon* and *Yin Tiger* merge, water and fire blend—this is the measure.\nThe *Eight Segments of Marvelous Text*, the *Thousand-Mouthed Living Method*—\nAbove, there is a path.\nLǚ Gōng’s lofty virtue does not abandon the world—\nIf one has the portion, they must meet.\n\nAcross the *Ten Isles* and *Three Mountains*,\nMounting *Luan* and *Hè*, we depart together.\n\n**Part Four**\n\n**Part One**\nNurture water, nurture essence, nurture spirit, nurture blood—\nFirst, one must nurture *qi*.\nSun and moon, yin and yang,\nThe six lines, the eight *guà*—\nStudy closely the *Cān Tóng Qì* [参同契].\n\nAn empty body, an empty treasure—\nA thousand words, ten thousand phrases—\nAll boil down to two characters: *Kǎn* and *Gāo* [坎高].\n\nAscending Kunlun’s peak,\nReturning to the origin, restoring the root—\nOne must clarify beginning and end.\n\nThough the body be small,\nIt mirrors heaven and earth—\nEighty-four thousand *lǐ* vast.\n\nThe *Xuān Dàn* gate [玄牝],\nGiving birth to myriad transformations—\nAll lies within *Chōng Hé* [冲和].\n\nThis is the true truth beyond;\nNo other ultimate truth exists—\nOnly then does one believe in the *One Dao*.\n\nWhen we meet again with Zhōng Lǚ [钟吕],\nIf there remain unclear points,\nI beg the Master’s guidance.\n\n---\n**Song: *Yú Jiā Ào* [渔家傲]**\nThe Ultimate Dao is not distant—it lies near.\nA hair’s breadth misstep is like a thousand *lǐ* apart.\n\nThe Dao is hard to seek, yet its source is simple.\nIf we meet in harmony,\nA single leap reaches the Buddha’s realm.\n\nWhen water and fire merge—*Jì Jì* [既济]—\nThe *Three Corpses* and *Six Bandits* all retreat.\nThis alone grants eternal life and keen vision.\n\nBody, speech, mind—\nTransformed into one point of *Chōng Hé* *qi*.\n\n---\n**Part Two**\nSpirit is nature, *qi* is life—\nLet not the spirit stray, then the heart will settle.\nFortunate to have Master Cuī’s *Yào Jìng* [药镜].\n\nIf one attains ultimate truth,\nThe Whole Truth steadies, rooted in stillness.\nMaster and guest—inner clarity, outer response—\nThe *Líng Tái* [灵台] radiates celestial brilliance.\nTwo jars, one scene.\n\nHasten your cultivation—\nDo not wait until thirst drives you to dig the well.\n\n---\n**Part Three**\nNurture essence to root the spirit, guard *qi*—\nHeaven’s child and mother never part.\nKeep this in mind day and night, through all six hours.\n\nWithin the *Three Fields* [三田],\nWarm, harmonious—heaven and earth’s balanced water.\nBefore the Twelve Towers, white snow clings;\nBy the Nine Palaces, yellow sprouts rise.\nAt the Sun-Moon Mountains, we pay homage to the Emperor.\n\nSpirit-light ascends—\nThe body soars beyond the misty heights.\n\n---\n**Part Four**\nI possess a luminous pearl with no price—\nIts light eternally shines upon the *Zhī Tián* [芝田].\nNo *zhī* or *hū* [之乎] here.\n\nFew are the true listeners in this world.\nA million rays of essence, spirit-guarded—\nFour hundred and four ailments vanish.\nThe Fire Dragon returns to *Zào Huà* [造化].\n\nThe immortal chariot departs—\nNot a speck of dust follows the steed.\n\n---\n**Song: *Cù Pāi Mǎn Lù Huā* [促拍满路花]**\nEmbracing the Primordial, one can guard the One—\nThe Four Great Elements then rest in ease.\nThe heart must reflect inward—\nHow often does it find leisure?\n\nThe Golden Crow surges—\nFlying into the molten silver basin.\n\nHeart is Dao—\nDao is in the heart—\nWhere else should one seek the elixir?\n\n---\n**Part Two**\nWhy cling to robes and honors,\nDesiring to transcend the world?\nGlory lasts but a few days—\nThen it withers and falls.\n\nCultivating the True is easy,\nBut piling up deeds and merits is hard.\nI urge you to do good—\nThe Five Turbidities, the Three Realms—\nTransformed into cloud-isles, spirit mountains.\n\n---\n**Part Three**\nIf one remains ever serene and still,\nHeaven and earth all return to it.\nOne True contains all marvels—\nEntering *Xī Yí* [希夷].\n\nZhāo Wén [昭文] does not comprehend—\n*Qi* and climate have their gains and losses.\nDeluded thoughts extinguished,\nHunger, sleep, action—all cease.\n\n---\n**Part Four**\nThe furnace and cauldron form naturally—\nLuster shines through the curtains.\nJade Pool’s spirit-water surges—\nAbove, fertility blooms.\n\nLike fish drinking water—\nCold and warmth, each knows its own.\n\nOne’s own life and fate—\nOne’s own enlightenment—\nOne’s own life and fate is most convenient.\n\n---\n**Part Five**\nSpeaking of cultivation and nurturing—\nHow many paths exist?\nTruly, return to the source—\nThe Void Origin.\n\nThe Ultimate Truth, the Ultimate Dao—\nSimple, encompassing heaven and earth.\n*Kǎn* and birds, water and fire—\nJust a net and snare,\nYet one enduring point remains.\n\n---\n**Part Six**\nIf one truly offers incense here,\nThe *Five Thousand Words* are understood.\nGolden crystal flies past the elbow—\nPiercing Kunlun’s heights.\n\nThe Clear River winds nine bends—\nA single oar cuts through the misty gloom.\nStriking water for three thousand *lǐ*,\nNinety thousand *péng*’s journey—\nAll transforms into the Original Void.\n\n---\n**Song: *Jiāng Shén Zǐ* [江神子] (Slow)**\nIn groves and springs, I cultivate my simplicity.\nFreeing my spirit, lazy in worldly ties—\nMy resolve is iron.\n\nLofty and detached,\nA taste of truth amid idle talk.\nBy day, I wander—\nWild cranes on the cliffs are my Dao companions;\nBeneath the pine pavilion, the smoke lingers still.\n\nAt night, I listen alone to the lone monkey—\nOn the high peak, it howls at the moon.\n\nWhen my deeds are complete and my path fulfilled,\nI ride the auspicious clouds\nTo the Jade Pool’s celestial gate.\n\n---\n\n**Song: *Jiāng Shén Zǐ* (Slow) – Continued**\nWhen my spirit roams, the *luán* cranes and *hè* herons await to greet me.\nDancing in azure void,\nCelestial banners drift to welcome my audience.\nAt the Peach Spring Gathering, the *qiónglín* feast—\nNow I trustfully part ways.\n\nReaching here, boundless freedom,\nAs a guest of the *Pénglái* Isles.\nSpring descends from heaven—\nDelighting in the Dao, content in poverty.\nI sigh at ancient heroes,\nWho, in groves beneath the trees, find no one.\nTheir halls filled with gold and jade—\nYet they claim to bestow it upon their children and grandchildren.\n\nUltimately, it belongs to kin.\nAsk why, from the start, with nothing to

*nature* and *refine my essence*.\nA *golden plaque* at my belt,\nA *winnowing basket* in my hand.\nNo longer do I serve as *royal kin or noble retainer*.\n\n---\n**Seventh: Li Yue**\nMy *brushwork* does not encroach on *official duties*—\nI leap into the *happy realm of eternal life*.\nMy *fine black robes* are torn to rags,\nMy *iron crutch* drags in my hand.\nMy hair stands wild as *pine

wildly in midair, *Longsha’s* dust.\nBlack and crimson clouds surge,\nCold winds howl again.\nFlowers bloom atop the mountain.\n\n---\n**Pure Yang True Person’s Hundred-Character Diagram**\nMy nature loves *purity and stillness*,\nTaming the *monkey-mind* with *steadfastness*.\nI drink no wine—\nI’ve abandoned desire entirely.\nI covet no wealth—\nI compete in no *qi*.\nThough seen, I do not observe;\nThough heard, I do not listen.\nI judge no one’s faults—\nOnly my own afflictions I seek.\nWhen I meet the unruly, I guard my *root-nature*.\nIn office, I avoid *renown*;\nIn private, I act with *trustworthy conduct*.\nNot counted among men,\nI escape the *chest’s oppression*.\nBlending with the light, mingling with the dust,\nI mix only with *mundane emotions*.\nWhy do I not vie for *name*?\nOnce, I debated this with *high masters*.\n\n---\n**Poem by Master Liu Langran**\nFor decades, I’ve been *cast off*, drunk on *vast cups*,\nEach day indulging my *nature* until noon.\nThe *Tail Gate* opens, the *Dirt Mound* acupuncture point transparent—\nThe *elixir furnace* divides *creation’s authority*.\nOnly this path to the *clouds* must have its way,\nFor my fate was never shaped by *Heaven*.\nDo not say the *Great Dao* is hard to grasp—\nIt’s that *common folk* refuse to study *transcendence*.\n\n---\n**Second**\nFor decades, I’ve wandered *north and south*,\nSilently practicing *mysterious principles*, refining *truth*.\nI seek not the world’s *endless things*,\nOnly to find *myself* within the *cosmos*.\nHaving awakened, I know *ebb and flow*—\n*Inner Elixir* ever flows upstream.\nEven if we meet again after a thousand years,\nIt’s as fresh as today’s new dawn.\n\n---\n**Third**\nIn *Jingluo’s* secluded stillness,\nI dwell in an ancient *observatory* east of the *moat*.\nThough *worldly emotions* stain others, not me,\nI treat *dusty affairs* as *Dao* treats them differently.\nRefining *elixirs* is no labor of a thousand days’ suffering,\nCirculating *essence* keeps my limbs ever *permeated*.\nWhat the world treasures most is precious—\nApart from the *human body*, all is *emptiness*.\n\n---\n**Fourth**\nIn my *seeking-Dao* days, chaos reigned—\nI traversed mountains and rivers like clouds.\nI studied *longevity* by chasing *external things*,\nYet never heard the *True Path*.\nMy *yang essence* lost its *harmonious qi*,\n*Gold and stone* labored in vain, heated by *foreign fire*.\nAlas, the *common folk* fail to awaken—\nThey gladly rot in *wilds*, becoming *mounds of dust*.\n\n---\n**Fifth**\nAbandon the *Nine Classics* and *Three Histories*—\nThey are of no use to the *body*.\nBetter to preserve *original harmony* and *qi*,\nAnd tend the *great elixir furnace*.\nRetaining *true essence* will save you from *old age*,\nRefining *golden substance* will pierce the *void*.\nIf you don’t know the *path of longevity*,\nWhat use are the *common folk’s* deluded natures?\n\n---\n**Sixth**\nSeeking *nobility* and *wealth* is endless—\nWhat use are *high offices* and *extreme riches*?\nBetter to wield *authority* with *light heart*,\nThan to endure *poverty* with *self-contentment*.\nLeaning on a *crooked pillow*, I let spring days stretch—\nCirculating *essence*, I spare not a hair’s decline.\nWhen we meet again beyond *things*,\nSurely we’ll be *immortals* with a *predestined bond*.\n\n---\n**Seventh**\n*True lead* and *true mercury* are not hard to find—\nIt’s that *common folk* misuse their *minds*.\n*Moon’s shadow* and *sun’s soul* are clear and easy,\nBut *wood’s essence* and *fire’s timing* run deep.\nNine years of toil refining *essence*—\n*Alchemical transformations* awaken the *five metals*.\nTo leave the world, one grain suffices—\n*Kunlun* and *Penglai* will know your *harmony*.\n\n---\n**Eighth**\nThe *double spine* and *dual channels* reach the *crown*—\nThis is the *root path* of cultivation.\nFrequently swallow *Jiachi Pool’s* *jade nectar*,\nLet *Zifu’s* *Yuan Lord* ascend.\nMake your *qi* surge through *passages and joints*,\nThen *essence* will naturally fill the *Valley Spirit*.\nWhen you attain *longevity’s realm*,\nYou’ll thank the one who first taught you.\n\n---\n**Ninth**\nHeaven’s net loosely ensnares the *ten thousand forms*,\nA pine’s fall makes *Hua Mountain* wither.\nAfter cold clouds pass, a *lonely moon* remains,\nWhen *winter snow* arrives, it faces the *Great Void*.\n*Dragon and serpent* return to *Zifu’s* *Purple Palace*,\n*Thousand-year cranes and phoenixes* descend to *Cangwu*.\nSince parting from my master,\nThere are few *true men* in *east, west, north, or south*.\n\n---\n*Langranzi*, a native of *Qi*.\nAfter following *Emperor Xuanzong of Tang* to *Shu*,\nHe encountered *Divine Master Sima Chengzhen’s* oral instructions,\nReceived the *Great Elixir* *Golden Liquid* formula,\nAnd after successful cultivation, returned to *Luoyang*.\nLocal elders say that during the *Song Endong* era,\n*Langranzi* died drunk in *Peach Blossom Alley*.\nAt the time, heavy snow fell, yet within a *ten-foot radius* of his corpse,\nNot a single flake touched the ground.\nOfficials examined the body—\nOnly *gold cicadas* entered and exited his *nose, mouth, and ears*,\nThen flew into the sky.\nAll gazed upward, and when they looked back,\nThe corpse was gone.\n\n*A Daoist of the Wànlíng Cháoyuàn*, *Zhao Yinwei*,\nCollected *Langranzi’s* poems, raised funds to carve them on stone,\nAnd spread his teachings.\nHe knocked at my door, showed me these verses,\nAnd I, having carefully examined them,\nFound them no more than *qi-circulation* and *saliva-swallowing*,\n*Nurturing yang* and *dismissing yin*—\nConsistent with my own practice.\nThus, I happily inscribed this in writing.\n*Huángtǒng* first year, third month, second day,\n*Fānghú Zhīzú* respectfully records.\n\n**太空歌**\n*Mǎ Dānyáng*\n\nThe Way may be spoken, yet not the constant Way,\nStill and unmoving—eternally preserved.\nGuard the cold radiance piercing boundless void,\nOne offering of pristine clarity, luminous and pure.\n\nThe Law may be taught, yet not by any law,\nClear and deep—all conditions extinguished.\nThen know: neither birth nor death remains,\nAncestral debts and grudges now severed clean.\n\nWhat is born? What dies?\nStill and clear, clear and still.\nSince recognizing such luminous truth,\nOne knows the nature of thought preserves the life.\n\nSeek not the True, discard not the False,\nFor in seeking and discarding, cunning arises.\nOnce cunning arises, the True is abandoned—\nYet fleeing the blade, you meet the butcher’s knife.\n\nNot yet walked, not yet seen,\nTo extinguish life is hard, yet harder still.\nWalk one step, awaken one step—\nWithout walking, vainly boasting of Chang’an’s path.\n\nYou have not yet awakened—do not force praise,\nNor claim the void is one unified house.\nWhen the heart is not yet clear, speak not of the Way,\nLike a blind man gazing at a lotus in bloom.\n\nThis side fair, that side foul,\nLuring the ox to wander recklessly.\nIf the mind’s eye is not yet bright,\nClose your eyes, still your heart, and seal your lips.\n\nNo need for hands, no need for ropes,\nNo need to bind or grasp tightly.\nWithout intent, the wind’s shadow is seized—\nSpontaneously, motion and stillness both forgotten.\n\nNeither clinging to scripture nor rejecting it,\nIn dual dissolution, inner and outer dwell.\nAbandoning the path, speech falters;\nClinging to text, you lose your own pearl.\n\nMind is Zen, nature is the Way,\nEach step contested—how much more?\nA teacher’s single finger points to the root—\nThe Stone Man claps, laughing heartily.\n\nZen as the lineage, the Way as the ancestor,\nShattering metal, wood, water, fire, earth.\nLuminous radiance interpenetrates true void—\nYet laughs at one, two, three, four, five.\n\nLineage and method both unified,\nOnly true practice and true virtue suffice.\nWhen virtue and practice are fulfilled,\nOnly a point illuminates the cold sky.\n\nNeither Way nor Zen,\nFathomless and obscure—naturally unified.\nAll things stripped bare by the pure eye,\nThe void resounds, boundless and bright.\n\n---\n\n**悟真歌**\n*Féng Zūnshī*\n\nAwakened within awakening, enlightened within insight,\nA single spark of luminous light, unobstructed.\nUnleash the fierce flame to illuminate *Sādhāra*’s world,\nThe *Dharma-realm* stretches vast, yet stands alone revealed.\n\nThese subtle messages, so profound,\nA wooden man points afar—clouds return in vain.\nThis mystic gate defies description,\nYet seen in the moment, forgotten at once.\n\nNot the tangles of an old woman’s tongue,\nBut the genuine compassion of wondrous truth.\nA moon’s wheel lifted by a staff,\nA furnace’s red flame cradling spring’s snow.\n\nI was originally a *Great Awakening* immortal,\nWith fate, I grasped the ancestor’s Zen.\nReturning, a song—no one responds,\nJade bamboos and yellow flowers, natural and free.\n\nIn the painted hall, incense smoke drifts fine,\nIn vain I sigh like *Manjuśrī* inquiring of illness.\nAt *Caoxi*’s stream, the moon is bright, the wind pure,\nGolden lotuses bloom across *Jeta*’s grove.\n\nShouldering the tiger-staff, I return home,\nSnow seals the mountain path—no passage now.\nWho at this moment understands my ease?\nOnly the few branches of plum will know.\n\nSince recognizing the Way of Chang’an,\nI love not idle flowers nor wild grass.\nDeep in the night, the *kukku* cries on the bough,\nBefore the wine-jar, spring arrives anew.\n\nAt home, effortless joy in non-action,\nEvery touch reveals sacred form.\nNot the thousand-eyed compassion,\nYet the jade maiden plucks forth ancient *Māni*.\n\nWhat spell could illuminate this truth?\nFathomless, obscure—yet dimly glimpsed.\nOrdinary beings fail to recognize this *Tathāgata*,\nA lion’s den for the three ages’ Buddhas.\n\nTrue leisure, true joy—whom to praise?\nAll are *crane-herons* trapped in a well’s depths.\nA lone *kōkin* plucked to silence,\nGreen mountains still lock mist and cloud.\n\n---\n\n**证道歌**\n*Lǚ Dòngbīn*\n\nAwakening to the True yet failing to grasp life—\nThis is the first sickness of cultivation.\nMerely cultivating *xìng* while neglecting the elixir,\nA myriad kalpas of yin-spirits struggle to attain sainthood.\n\nGrasping life’s foundation yet lost in ancestral nature,\nLike a mirror without treasure—useless.\nA man of heaven’s span, seizing yin and yang as his foundation.\nNature and life complete, profound yet deeper still—\nA ship crossing the ocean’s surging waves.\n\nCapturing alive the dragon-serpent’s form,\nOnly then does the artisan’s skill prove true.\n\n---\n\n**得道歌**\n*Jǐngyáng*\n\nThe Way is hard to enter, hard to seek,\nEasy to speak of—who can attain?\nFalse paths deceive the world in myriad forms,\nA thousand paths to the Way, yet only one true.\n\nSome who study the Way now refuse to bow—\nHow pitiful!\nHiding from heaven, earth, and man,\nBefore attaining, they boast their success.\n\nTo become an immortal is not so hard,\nYet immortals must be born of immortal essence.\nIf not of immortal nature, do not presume,\nFor every move invites yin-demons’ grudges.\n\nThis matter is no small art,\nRelying solely on virtue and conduct to shock the dark.\n\nSever delusion, extinguish greed,\nEach step grounded in firm resolve.\nIf you grasp your true nature and heart as one,\nThen I dare speak truly of the essence.\n\nCultivating the Golden Elixir is easy to begin,\nYet mastering *Zhōngyōng* and the *Yì* is key.\nAll doing and striving are ultimately vain,\nSpeaking of dragons only ends in tiger’s harm.\n\nAt the origin, movement stirs the body,\nIf further confused, punishment follows.\nEver recall the undivided chaos before differentiation,\nMysteries unspeakable—nature’s heart is clear.\n\nThe body’s every part belongs to yin,\nYet one thing holds yang-essence—man does not know.\nRound and steady, it follows like a shadow,\nNeither void nor form, yet neither color nor substance.\nDispersed through all things, filling heaven and earth,\nWithin one thing lies the *Tàijí*.\nRetreating, it hides in the profound unity of nature—\nSeen, yet unseen; sought, yet unfound.\n\nMy elixir’s secret is uniquely mine,\nNo need for days, months, or years.\nNo fire’s timing, no adding or subtracting,\nNo separation of self and other, flaw or merit.\nNeither birth nor death, nor anything to cultivate or speak of.\nWhen hungry, eat; when tired, sleep.\nAt leisure, sit in meditation; when lazy, rest.\n\n「When food is met, it is consumed; when wine is met, it is drunk,\nNo fasting or observance—only the heart’s clarity remains.\n\nRiches and honor mean nothing to the mind,\nFame and gain, strife and dispute—all are severed.\n\nStill and concentrated, nurturing the *yuánshén*,\nNo thought arises—true reality is distinct.\n\nTrue reality is distinct—self-satisfied,\nDay and night, the moon within the mind is seen.\nNo coming, no going—just the center,\nPiercingly bright, all eight extremes illuminated.\n\nNeither full nor lacking,\nLike a red furnace’s single snowflake.\n\nThough this moment is attained,\nOnly when void and space are shattered is it fully understood.\n\nLeisurely and free, joyfully unrestrained,\nHuman vexations do not touch this mind.\n\nSeekers of the Dao, seize the time—\nA hundred years pass like lightning.\n\nIf not grasped now, great foolishness ensues,\nDo not wait till old age when *qi* and spirit are spent.\n\nSwiftly turn back, fiercely cut through—\nOne stroke, two divisions, blood must flow.\nTo shed the mortal form and take the dharmic,\nRefine this single thought as iron.\n\nThese words are spoken with deep intent—\nAll heavenly secrets are now revealed.\nIf students hear them lightly,\nFear only regret at death’s door.\n\n**Heart’s Assignment**\nFor the Three True Ones\n\nWorldly affairs are endless, yet all are void.\nHaving entered the Mysterious Gate’s teachings,\nWork must be done on the heart’s foundation.\n\nGreat wisdom is serene, undisturbed,\nIn the stillness of the unborn—tranquil and boundless.\nTrue essence is silent, unspoken,\nFree in the midst of absolute cessation.\n\nTo cultivate the eternal seed of life,\nFirst, hold the heart’s foundation firm.\nSix senses purified, a thousand afflictions extinguished,\nThree realms emptied, all entanglements resolved.\n\nPerception, hearing, awareness—\nThese are the roots of obstruction to the Dao.\nCalm and pure, devoid of desire—\nThis is the great principle of sustaining the true.\n\nIf one is steadfast in learning the Dao,\nOne must fully awaken the heart.\nWhen the heart is still, solitary clarity shines alone,\nWhen the heart remains, all phenomena intrude.\n\nThe true form is neither lacking nor excessive—\nVisible even in life;\nIllusory appearances, though shaped, are ever impermanent—\nWhat use is there in seeking them?\n\nKnowing all dharmas are empty,\nAll ties abandoned—\nSitting in practice, this is the Dao’s madness.\n\nGiving aid and spreading kindness—\nThis is virtue’s deceit.\nGreat skill feigns clumsiness,\nThen one knows all things are effortless;\nGood plans are not schemes,\nOnly let go each and every thought.\n\nLet the single heart remain unmoved,\nAll actions will be complete.\nEach day, exhilarate the spirit,\nTruly know life’s joy in harmony with Heaven.\n\nThrough spring, summer, autumn, and winter,\nEat when hungry, drink when thirsty;\nOr facing wind, flowers, snow, and moon,\nWalk steadily and sleep in peace.\n\nIf one can meet all things without attachment,\nActing in each scene as play—\nThe Dao is already complete within the inch of heart,\nWhy labor through countless lifetimes?\n\nYǒngjiā once enlightened,\nForced to linger one night before returning;\nLúxíng still doubted,\nWasted time till the third watch came.\n\nThus, all things are empty,\nAll dust is discarded—\nBeyond nature, no true substance exists,\nBefore the eyes, all is illusion’s bubble.\n\nEternal life has form yet blends unseen,\nEven spirits cannot fathom it;\nThe Great Symbol is formless, everywhere present,\nHeaven and earth cannot contain it.\n\nIndeed, the fundamental truth is to clarify the heart—\nWhy toil with weary resolve?\nIt cannot be borrowed from another,\nOnly through self-mastery is it realized.\n\nGrand discourse forgets words,\nTrue scriptures transcend letters—\nRelying on the crow’s cry to proclaim,\nFalling blossoms to point the way,\nStone women teaching in person,\nWooden men receiving the gift.\n\nShallow minds with little insight\nSay, \"No, not so!\"\nEnlightened ones with vast vision\nSay, \"Indeed, just as this!\"」\n\nThe awakened dwell in boundless ease,\nThe lost stumble through thorns at every step.\n\nTo seek the supreme attainment beyond heaven,\nOne must cast aside all worldly concerns.\n\n**Eight Principles of Chan**\n\nMaster Feng’s teaching:\nDao has no gradual or sudden—\nChan knows no before or after.\nThe lost wander beyond eons,\nThe enlightened stand before their eyes.\n\nNeither coming nor going,\nMastering the Six Powers in freedom;\nNeither birth nor death,\nTranscending the Three Realms in solitary perfection.\n\nUnshaken by clamor,\nUnbound by ease.\nThe five sects’ disciples,\nCling to fabricated knowledge;\nThe One Vehicle’s adherents,\nAlso indulge in illusion.\n\nOnly when ever-present clarity shines,\nAnd all burdens are released—\nA thousand winds through the pines,\nStone women sing between the branches;\nThree moonbeams on the ridge,\nPastoral boys tumble in the light.\n\nInnate wisdom dawns,\nSudden luminosity unfolds.\nWhen circumstances arise, nature manifests;\nBefore forms, the heart must fade.\n\nThe Four Symbols merge,\nThe Three Talents harmonize.\nGreen waters flow eternally—\nThough you rot and decay;\nBlue mountains stand firm—\nAs clouds drift, they drift away.\nEverlasting through ancient and present,\nUnwithering, unperishing.\n\nThe dull are ensnared by sound and color,\nThe enlightened transcend all existence.\nScattering wind and cloud,\nCaressing stars and constellations.\nThe hollow lute’s melody—\nWooden horses roar before the hall;\nThe snow-melting tune is rare—\nJade dragons race beneath the sea.\n\nDo not seek East-West Bodhisattvas,\nNor hunt South-North Amitābha.\nWherever the eye turns, the Dharma-realm is present—\nWhere is there no Chan?\n\nWhen one grasps this truth,\nOnly then may one attain suchness.\n\nDwelling in dust yet transcending it,\nNot falling into the Six Demons’ snares.\nEncountering origin on all sides,\nSilent illumination returns to primal purity.\n\nOld women’s gossip, a thousand eons of bone-trading;\nDirect pointers to the numinous source—\nA single absolute utterance.\n\nSeizing freedom, killing and living stand alone.\nWhite clouds and green cliffs—\nEvery peak is true suchness;\nEmerald bamboo and golden flowers—\nEvery thing is pure awakening.\n\nErasing all boundaries, encompassing the great thousand—\nHe who displays the flower to the assembly\nTruly overreaches;\nHe who shouts at the Buddha and curses the Ancestors\nAlso errs.\n\nWho understands the step-by-step lotus?\nReturning from the Deer Park,\nThe moon fills the riverboat.\n\nDrawing forth one’s own family wind,\nInstantly surpassing the Ten Bhūmis;\nShattering the stubborn void’s illusion,\nAlone feasting the heavenly hosts.\n\nA worthless fool dares to bicker—\nAll are but dregs;\nWho gnaws at public cases\nCannot fathom profound truth.\nOff by a hair’s breadth,\nMissed by a thousand leagues.\n\nThe Wooden Man says:\n*To know the Western Intent,\nOne must drain the marrow of the Golden Nirmāṇa Devas.*\n\n**On Recognizing Heart and Mind**\n\nIf one seeks cultivation,\nFirst recognize heart and mind,\nThen awaken nature.\n\nWhat is heart?\nWhat is mind?\nThat which perceives is heart;\nThousands of thoughts, millions of musings—this is mind.\n\nMind arises from thought,\nHeart is born from things.\nThe root of arising and generation\nLies within the inch-square.\n\nThis inch-square—\nThe original true heart.\nHeart has no heart,\nMind has no mind.\n\nBecause familiar scenes are hard to forget,\nThe heart drifts, the mind stirs,\nAnd true heart is obscured, unseen.\nOne must still the heart, settle the mind,\nAnd inwardly observe the heart.\n\nThe stillness, unmoving—this is *dhyāna*;\nAwareness within stillness—this is *prajñā*.\n*Dhyāna* is essence,\n*Prajñā* is function.\nWhen both are complete,\nThey never wane day by day.\n\n**On Serenity**\n\nTo love broadly is to be muddled—\nWho can cherish purity?\nEntangled in myriad cares,\nI alone keep one life serene.\nBreak free from the deepest chains,\nEver dwell in tranquility;\nAvoid the gnats and flies’ snares,\nAwaken to luminous clarity.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*Cut all worldly ties,\nUphold the primal order.*\nTo play in the boundless void of Great Purity,\nOne must root deeply and stand firm;\nTo dwell in true simplicity and leisure,\nOne must rejoice in eternal life and keen vision.\n\nWhen this truth is known,\nThe heart becomes clear as autumn water;\nAll movements in time\nAre subtle as spring winds rising.\n\nStanding alone, yet upright—\nSilent, yet present.\nUnblemished yet not rigid—\nLike a mirror revealing beauty and flaw;\nLuminous yet without favor—\nLike the moon illuminating heaven and earth.\n\nUpright in singular nature,\nCalm in the Six Roots.\nNuminous purity stands aloof,\nLike pine and cypress in virtue;\nLawful vastness unfolds,\nBeyond the gate of the Mysterious and Primordial.\n\nIn the world, the body returns to the lone cloud,\nEmotions rise like wild cranes.\nSubtle and wondrous, it hides mountains in marshes;\nBeyond thought, it buries elixir in valleys.\nPure and transparent, boundless and free—\nThe spirit soars to Guishan’s realm;\nSelf and objects forgotten,\nThe steps tread the void’s expanse.\n\nUltimately, this is not the private domain of the Sage—\nIt is what one makes of it.\nIf one does not abandon name and gain,\nHow can one awaken to the rare and lofty?\n\nThe great sage speaks leisurely,\nEchoing the South Mountain’s words;\nThe petty man frets endlessly,\nHearing Confucius’ teachings in vain.\n\nAs for those who practice Chan amid desire,\nCarrying their families’ burdens while preaching subtlety—\nThey must earn the respect of the lowest fool,\nAnd avoid the scorn of the virtuous.\n\nOne must only quietly cultivate,\nTurning toward leisure’s reflection.\nTo exhaust emptiness and uphold stillness firmly—\nThis is Laozi’s family tradition;\nTo discard limbs and abandon cleverness—\nThis is Yan Yuan’s essential key.\n\nWhen heart and method both vanish,\nLife and death are cast aside.\nThrough pure refinement, the Dao is perfected;\nThrough empty leisure, the Mysterious is pierced.\n\nHaving abandoned the causes of defilement,\nThe universe grows desolate;\nSealing the breath of non-action,\nOne laughs among the clouds.\n\nStrange—\nAnts toil for food, moths perish in flame.\nWhy cling to this sinking suffering?\nWho would perfect virtue’s nature?\n\nAlas—\nBetter to hear early of leisure and purity,\nAnd return to the Celestial Metropolis to worship the Emperor.\n\n**On Perfect Truth**\n\nDivine and saintly grace descends,\nMercy spreads universally.\n\n**On the Dao of Perfect Truth**\n\nHaving embraced the vast expanse of the Mysterious Teaching,\nI now reverently uphold the Dao of Perfect Truth.\nWho would have known that the tenfold heights of the High Immortals\nDescend to wander in this mortal world;\nThat the Great Explication of the Three Sovereigns’ ancient Way\nHarmonizes with the transformations of humanity?\n\nThe roots of virtue permeate all schools,\nYet the heart returns to the One Rectitude.\nThose who abandon the secular world sever ties with kin and love;\nThose who endure hardship rejoice in Heaven’s decree and accept fate.\nThus, Perfect Truth is both learning and refining the nature.\nWorldly fame and wealth, sensual pleasures—\nView them as floating scum upon water;\nWisdom and insight—\nHold them sacred as the foremost saints of the Teaching.\n\nFor indeed, learning is not a rigid possession,\nBut a quest for the Great Way.\nAmassing abundant virtue,\nOne extends compassion through skilful means;\nDeeply cultivating and preserving,\nOne attains inner success.\nTo dwell in non-action’s clarity,\nTo seek the Way’s unity—\nObjects are distinct as the bright moon in a clear pool;\nEach response appears as the gentle wind through swaying grass.\nAll must be discerned in high and low,\nAnd lifted in full awareness.\nLearners have causes and fruits;\nThose who realize transcend birth and death.\nIn utmost stillness and harmony,\nIn utmost firmness and purity—\nUnifying the myriad virtues to interact with the world,\nNever forsaking mercy;\nProclaiming the Three Teachings to awaken the lost,\nStill honoring the wise and virtuous.\nIn essence, begging is no shame,\nNor is utter poverty a sorrow.\nBending oneself to benefit others,\nOne bestows kindness upon the aged and destitute;\nUpholding lofty resolve and integrity,\nOne scorns kings and nobles with laughter.\nThis is the Perfect Truth’s heroic sage,\nThe Dao-realized Immortal stream.\n\nSudden enlightenment to Heaven’s mechanisms,\nBroadcasts the Mysterious Wind through the Sacred Realm;\nWidespread offerings of fragrant bait,\nUniversally seeks the knowing companions for the journey to the Isle of the Sea.\nThus, seeing clearly into things awakens the heart,\nAnd knowing emptiness realizes the Dao.\n\n**[Learning] the Perfect Truth’s Dao and methods,**\nOne must adhere to the teachings of Zhong and Lü;\n**[Taking] the Great Way’s Mysterious principles,**\nOne must strictly follow the doctrines of Huang and Lao.\nIn pure stillness and simplicity,\nRefining the Vermilion Elixir to extract Silver Threads;\nIn pristine subtlety,\nForging the Golden Treasure in the Cinnabar Cauldron.\nDiscarding false pretenses,\nRevealing the natural.\nAttaining the ever-more-wondrous essence of reality,\nObtaining the utterly complete True Function.\nFive paths of silver clouds pierce the celestial vault,\nOne radiant wheel of moon illuminates the sky.\nWith crane’s carriage and golden scriptures,\nOne ascends to the Nine Yang Palace;\nWith peach wine and jade nectar,\nOne takes seat among the Ten Thousand Saints.\n\nAlas—\nSome remain in foolish delusion,\nEngaged in petty disputes of self and others.\nThose who declaim scriptures and proclaim the Teachings,\nDo they truly grasp the Mysterious?\nThose who deceive the middle and lower ranks,\nDo not understand cause and effect.\nOne must depart the Fire Hall’s favors and the Mountain of Merit,\nAnd withdraw from the bonds of name and gain.\nTruly, if one wishes to know Perfect Truth’s essence,\nSudden enlightenment to emptiness is the path.\n\n**The Emperor’s Ode to the Dao**\n\nWithin the Three Teachings, the Dao alone is most exalted.\nAbove, it does not bow to the Son of Heaven;\nBelow, it does not pay respects to ministers and officials.\nAvoiding the secular world, it hides its traces;\nEscaping the worldly net, it refines the True.\nScorning the forests and streams,\nIt rejects fame and profit;\nRejoicing in the mountains and valleys,\nIt forgets disgrace and glory.\nCrowning with the Star Cap, it blazes like the sun;\nWearing coarse hemp robes, it nurtures eternal spring.\nSome shave their heads and bare their feet,\nOthers tie their hair in a knot and wrap it in cloth.\nPlucking Immortal flowers to weave hats,\nFolding wild grasses to spread mats.\nDrinking from the Sweet Springs to rinse the teeth,\nFeasting on pine nuts to prolong life.\nSinging with hand-drums, dancing until clouds gather—\nWith mountain companions, sharing tea in friendly conversation;\nBy riverside gatherings, lifting cups to discuss ancient texts.\nLaughing at the vulgarity of lavish wealth,\nRejoicing in the ease of humble poverty.\nNot a single hair’s obstruction,\nNor a speck of entanglement.\nSome gather in threes to seek the Mysterious and inquire of the Dao,\nOthers converse in pairs on past and present.\nDiscussing past and present,\nThey sigh over the rise and fall of ancient worthies;\nSeeking the Mysterious and inquiring of the Dao,\nThey clarify the essence of their own True Nature.\nEnduring the shifts of cold and heat,\nCompleting the nine revolutions of the celestial tortoise and hare.\nGraying hair returns to youth,\nWhite hair turns green.\nCarrying a bamboo lunchbox, they enter markets to beg for meals;\nGathering herbs to heal the world and aid humanity.\nSome relieve suffering and benefit beings,\nOthers restore life from death.\nThose who cultivate the Immortal Way have bones of utmost firmness and refinement,\nThose who attain the Dao have spirits of peerless luminosity.\nForecasting fortune and misfortune, directing strange omens,\nDetermining calamity and blessing through subtle investigation of human affairs.\nExpounding the Dao and elevating the Supreme Sage’s orthodox Teaching,\nApplying talismans to dispel the world’s malevolent influences.\nSubduing demonic forces with a wave of the hand,\nDisplaying *qi* at the Gate of Thunder.\nKnocking upon Heaven’s gate, the True Immortals gather;\nStriking the earth’s threshold, the myriad spirits respond.\nSitting in silent contemplation of the True,\nStoring the spirit in a still chamber.\nSeizing the refined *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nExtracting the luminous essence of sun and moon.\nHarmonizing yin and yang to refine the nature,\nAdjusting water and fire to form the embryonic essence.\nWhen the two eights of yin dissipate,\nIt seems as if lost in a dream;\nWhen the three nines of yang flourish,\nIt vanishes like the distant night.\nAdapting to the four seasons in gathering,\nNurturing the nine transformations to complete the elixir.\nRiding the Azure Crane to ascend the Purple Palace,\nMounting the White Crane to pay homage to the Jade Capital.\nDrawing upon Heaven’s refined *qi*,\nManifesting the Dao’s utmost devotion.\nCompared to Confucianism,\nIts officials hold high rank and splendid titles—\nWealth and honor are fleeting clouds.\nCompared to Buddhism,\nIts joy is in quiescence and extinction—\nYet it does not escape the secular dust.\nI observe the Three Teachings,\nAnd find the Dao alone most exalted.\n\n**Record of the Ancestral Court**\n\nThe Ancestral Court once had no trace in Japan,\nBut Master Zhongyang illuminated and expounded the Mysterious Way.\nHis native home was in Chang’an, the capital of Jingzhao Prefecture,\nAnd his ancestral residence was in the Taizi Village of Liquan.\nHeaven sent down the Celestial Diagram, and Immortals descended;\nEarth emitted auspicious light, and purple *qi* ascended.\nHis mother bore an Immortal embryo for two years,\nAnd he was born in the fortunate era of Emperor Huizong of Song.\nIn the second year of Zhenghe (壬辰), the twelfth month, on the twenty-second,\nThe Emperor was born.\nThe Ancestral Master’s parents bore three sons,\nAnd Master Zhongyang had two younger brothers.\nAs a child, he entered school to receive a sage’s instruction,\nAnd mastered the Nine Classics and sacred texts.\nAt twenty-seven, he took the military examination,\nAnd deeply understood the arts of war, drawing a hard bow.\nWith both literary and martial prowess,\nHe was feared by all.\nThe Song Dynasty hailed his virtue and might as a world-renowned hero.\nHis thoughts were clear as a mirror,\nHis words resounded like a bell.\nOnce at the Gansha River, he drank wine,\nAnd there encountered two Immortal masters wrapped in coarse hemp robes.\n\n「Five volumes of profound mysteries were received through direct transmission,\nAnd seven orifices of spiritual insight revealed his merit.\n\nSince drinking the waters of the Gansha River,\nHis heart opened vastly, and his faculties became clear.\n\nAt forty-eight, he encountered the True Teaching,\nAnd abandoned the world to embrace the Dao, hidden within tombs.\nHe observed the inner landscape of reality,\nAnd only then comprehended the Five Phases’ transformative power.\n\nPiercing through the illusory and false forms,\nHe no longer inquired of mortal omens and portents.\n\nOnce again meeting the harmonious Li and dwelling in Liu Jiang,\nThe three of them resided together through three winters.\n\nIn thought, he reflected on the teachings of Qiu Liu, Tan Zhong, and Ma Yu,\nAnd renamed himself as *Wang Haifeng* [王害风].\n\nFire consumed his thatched hut, and he left the land of Qin,\nDeparting the southeastern regions to descend to the east.\n\nThree thousand miles away, he found a kindred soul,\nAnd through nine transformations entered the Southern Capital.\n\nThe Master summoned his disciples with personal instructions:\n“I shall return to the Pengleng [蓬瀛].”\n\nIn the tenth year of the Dading era (庚寅), at fifty-eight,\nHis lifespan ended.\n\nAt the *Cha Zi* [查子] shop, he ascended the path to Immortality,\nLeaving behind the ancient traditions of the *Quanzhen* [全真] school.\n\nSeven golden lotuses bloom at the hall’s entrance,\nThe *Changchun* [长春] and *Changjiao* [长教] lineages flourish within.\n\nThe teachings of *Quanzhen* [全真] in the *Qinghe* [清和] era are passed on,\nAnd the *Hao* [浩然] sect thrives atop *Panshan* [盘山], south of the peaks.\n\n*Dongzhen* [洞真], clad in white clouds, is the *Piyun* [披云] Master,\nWith boundless desirelessness, he ranks highest among all Immortal masters.\n\nEighteen senior masters gather here,\nFrom the *Gengzi* [庚子] era, their deeds began.\n\nDisciples from all under heaven come to lend their strength,\nDaoists across the world contribute their efforts.\n\nHeaven bestowed the craftsman *Cao Tidi* [曹提点],\nAnd the halls were built in the *Shuizhu* [水竹] village.\n\nLofty and majestic, they rise a hundred feet high,\nJade-tiled roofs and tortoiseshell-like windows touch the heavens.\n\nThe southern mountain’s lion-like beast spits water,\nFour beasts stand proud, their roars like winds of thunder.\n\nThousands of beams and arches arranged in the Eight Trigrams,\nFive ridges and six beasts aligned with the Nine Palaces.\n\nFrom afar, it resembles the summit of *Xumishan* [须弥],\nAnd in the distance, it mirrors the grandeur of *Taihuafeng* [太华峰].\n\nAbove, it connects with clouds and the Northern Dipper,\nBelow, it descends to the Nine Abodes and Nine Springs.\n\n〔Missing verse〕 The eight rivers behind the ridge all flow east.\nA thousand rays of dawn enshroud the precious halls,\nA thousand wisps of jade mist veil the ornate palaces.\n\nOnce, he saw cranes and phoenixes dancing in the sky,\nAnd heard celestial music resounding from the Heavenly Palace.\nAll manifestations gathered to pay homage to the Jade Emperor,\nThe saints and Immortals presented offerings to the Three Pure Ones.\n\nDeep within the crimson glow and violet mist, sealed tight,\nWhite clouds and auspicious *qi* [气] are firmly locked within.\n\nScattered red peach blossoms and green bamboo intermingle,\nThousands of verdant trees and azure pines stand in harmony.\n\nHe wandered the boundless realms of heaven and earth,\nAnd found no place more rare than the *Wang Zhongyang* [重阳] *Wanshou* [万寿] Palace.\n\nAt the hall’s entrance, *Zhao Zhenren* [赵真人] speaks:\n\n*\"The True One of the Primordial Dao,\nOpens wide the gate to all marvelous mysteries.\n\nThe *Quanzhen* [全真] Way is fully realized,\nAnd its teachings universally benefit all beings.\n\nThe fairy maidens of the *Yaochi* [瑶池],\nThe golden lotuses of *Wang Zhongyang*—seven blooms.\n\nThe *Langyuan* [阆苑] and *Jingong* [璚宫],\nThe *Changchun* [长春] lineage’s jade flowers—ten thousand leaves.\n\nThough branches may diverge in detail,\nAll paths ultimately return to the root.\n\nThough sects may vary in flow,\nAll rivers eventually merge into the sea.\n\nHe sets forth teachings in every direction,\nGathering clouds of friends from the four seas.\n\nHe sparks the *yuan* [缘] of the Dao in every place,\nSummoning the misty companions of the Three Mountains.\n\nThatched huts and humble dwellings,\nAll become adorned with precious halls and ornate palaces.\n\nRough hemp robes and coarse attire,\nAre graced with star-crowned caps and moon-trimmed cloaks.\n\nIt can be said that humans can magnify the Dao,\nExpounding the rules of the ancient sages.\n\nThe Dao’s methods naturally align with humanity,\nOpening the eyes of future generations.\n\nAt the *Liao Zhen* [了真] Hall, no trace of worldly attachment remains;\nUnder the *Wanxing* [万行] banner, all are urged to exert their efforts.\n\nThose above must act with boundless compassion,\nThose below must always hold reverence and obedience.\n\nWorldly disputes cloud the mind,\nAnd fail to grasp the essence of the *Quanzhen* [体玄] Way’s tradition.\n\nDaoist insight unites in harmony,\nFollowing the ancient practice of refining the *Danjiao* [丹肠].\n\nFrom early times, he was a transcendent Immortal,\nNow he serves as the Master’s *fahuai* [法眷].\n\nDo not linger in the fleeting dust of mortal concerns,\nNor mock the precious pearls of a thousand sages.\n\nIn life, he shared in cultivating the Dao’s fruits,\nAnd together ascended to transcend the mortal ranks.\n\nThe *Chujia* [出家] scholar, with clear vision, delves into the depths.\nThe *Licheng* [离尘] warrior, with pure heart, illuminates the path.\n\nI humbly pray for your revered care.\n\n*Feng Zunshi* [冯尊师]’s second verse:\n\nThe Supreme Dao is boundless and profound,\nThe wondrous Dao is rare and elusive.\nBefore heaven and earth, it was already present,\nNot confined to words or texts.\n\nIts light is luminous and void-pervading,\nFilling all ten directions.\nIts purity is clear and spiritually resonant,\nFlowing through the Three Realms.\n\nIn endless transformations and changes,\nIt encompasses and governs yin and yang.\nIts essence and function are eternally true,\nLimitless and beyond measure.\n\nYet how can mortals, ensnared by heavy veils,\nBear its weight?\n\nValuing the ancient while scornful of the present,\nThey fabricate knowledge and understanding.\nThey debate the *Dharma* [法] and practice Zen,\nBut only open side doors to the Way.\n\nFrom then on, the *Taiji* [太极] Primordial simplicity was lost,\nAnd the teachings were divided into three gates.\nWithin the realm of emotions and perceptions,\nThey could not return to the origin.\n\nTo see these people thus,\nOne must deeply pity them.\n\nTherefore, the Master widely opened the *fangbian* [方便],\nAnd broadly spread the *cihang* [慈航] of compassion.\n\nHe universally rescued beings from suffering,\nFreeing them from the six realms of transmigration.\n\nHe guided them back to the True Path,\nAnd let them revel once more in the *Hongmeng* [鸿蒙] of primordial simplicity.\n\nHe broke open the gate of serene detachment,\nAnd wandered freely through the *Qingdu* [清都] and *Jianguo* [降阙] of the celestial realms.\n\nOn the Five Clouds Platform,\nHe clearly transmitted the *Shuimi* [黍米] and *Xuanzhu* [玄珠];\nBeside the Nine Luminaries Tower,\nHe raised high the *Han guang* [含光] treasure sword.\n\nIn boundless expanse, he moves with effortless freedom,\nPure and unobstructed, like the void itself.\n\nIn action and stillness, he transcends *wuwei* [无为],\nMerging into the undifferentiated essence.\n\nThus, he can sweep away the *Sadā* [萨埵],\nAnd playfully engage with *Bodhi* [菩提].\n\nNeither death nor birth remain,\nNo excess, no deficiency.\n\nBoth saints and mortals are released,\nEmbracing the vastness of emptiness and form.\n\nEven if the *nirūna* [泥牛] bellows at the moon,\nOr the wooden horse whinnies in the wind,\nOr the *lòutòu* [漏透] snares the mind,\nOr the *jiāxiào* [作家] becomes a laughingstock—\n\nWith fiery words, he scolds the blue-eyed barbarian monks;\nIn silent illumination, he shatters the golden-maned lion.\n\nThe Five-Leaf Flower blooms in full,\nAnd the Three Mysteries are gently brushed aside.\nHe frees the *Yuanshi* [元始] from its constraints,\nAnd withdraws the *Muni* [牟尼]’s artifices.\n\nHe unfurls the *xiàngwàng* [象罔],\nAnd tramples the *nièpán* [涅盘].\n\nHe severs the *Caoxi* [曹溪] lineage,\nAnd leisurely resides in *Zhengpu* [郑圃].\n\nBefore *Dàmó* [达磨] and *Luóshì* [罗什] were born,\nThe *Nanhua* [南华] teachings already repelled *Qùkè* [御寇].\n\nAlas, how scholars forget their roots and chase after branches,\nAbandoning their own to favor outsiders.\n\nThey do not knock at the *Chōngxū* [冲虚] gate,\nBut cling to foreign *Dharma* [梵语].\n\nTheir homeland is secure,\nYet they seek validation in the West.\n\nIn vain, they wear out their straw sandals,\nSearching for what, exactly?\n\nThe stone lion’s heart has been gouged out,\nAnd the wild fox’s drool seeps into the marrow.\n\n」\n\n「When one seeks to practice *chan* and aspire to buddhahood,\nBoasting in riddles like *ge teng* vines—\nWho dares to deceive others?\n\nSuch a gentleman—how then does he guide others?\n\nNow, I casually cast forth the *Dharma* elixir,\nHurling it into the mortal world,\nOffering this *tiánhú* [醍醐], benefiting the noble ones.\n\nI uplift the authentic Daoist life,\nRevealing their true nature before them.\n\nI disclose some clues,\nEntrusting them to kindred spirits—\nThis family tradition, what melody does it sing?\n\nNot bound by *lǜlǜ* [律吕], yet transcending mortal *yangchūn* [阳春],\nA stringless *qin* [琴], yet blowing the *tiānlài* [天籁].\n\nNo need for jade threads and gold needles,\nTo embroider *nícháng* [霓裳] or phoenixes.\n\nThose who grasp this truth—\nReturning home, they ascend the eternal gathering,\nWhere the moonlit towers never sleep.\n\nA bottomless basket draws water,\nA rootless iron tree blooms.\n\nThis grand design—\nHow shall it be sealed with official insignia?\n\nAt the borders of *Húnlún* [浑沦], no negotiation allowed.\nBefore the *Língbǎo* [灵宝] peak—who dares set foot?\n\nOnly be unrestrained, not entangled in confusion.\nInstantly awakening to the Dao’s wind,\nRoaming the cosmos in ease,\nLong awaiting the celestial ranks—\nI humbly implore, hold this in reverence.\n\n---\n\n**The Third [Section]**\n*Qín Zhēnrén* [秦真人]\n\nA hundred years of life—\nSwift as flowing water,\nA lifetime’s deeds—\nEmpty as floating bubbles.\n\nYesterday, peach and apricot blossoms on your face,\nToday, frost and snow break through your hair.\n\n*Sū Xīnggōng* [苏相国], though bearing six seals of office,\nCould not escape the *wúcháng* [无常];\n*Guō Zǐyú* [郭子仪], though rising to the *sāngōng* [三公],\nStill met the *dàxiàn* [大限].\n\nThe white ants’ battlefield crumbles like a dream,\nThe *zǐguī* [子规]’s cry urges you to return.\n\nDo not wait for calamity to strike—\nOnly then will you know it was all illusion.\n\nGold and jade fill the halls—\nHow can you guard them,\nWhen your children stand before you,\nAnd you sigh in vain?\n\nRed towers, emerald pavilions, high white walls—\nNone concern you;\nWhite horses, red wheels, golden bells—\nAll belong to others.\n\nIn vain you bind your wounds—\nUnnoticed, time’s finger ticks away.\n\nThe *guǐshǐ* [鬼使者] do not bend to favors,\n*Yán Lǎozi* [阎老子] cares not for human sentiment.\n\nA thousand tears fall—\nWhat use is regret now?\n\nThe intestines split into nine—\nWho else is there to blame?\n\nAt this juncture, rest or not—\nOnly then do you know the myriad errors.\n\nMelancholy as falling flowers and flowing water,\nPowerless to bear;\nDesolate as withered grass and autumn winds,\nUnbearable to recall.\n\nYet the wise and resolute—\nPlunging into all things, awakening in an instant.\n\nGold is dung, jade is dust—\nTo buy the Dao;\nHeaven and Earth are turned—\nBy the hands of the sage.\n\nNo more calculating gains and losses,\nMeasuring dawn and dusk.\n\nBackbone like steel, heels like iron.\nWhy bother refining elixirs or alchemy,\nTo return to the *Sāndǎo* [三岛]?\nNo need for furnaces or cauldrons—\nDirectly ascend to the *Shízōu* [十洲].\n\n*Xǔ Jīngyáng* [旌阳] lifted his home to the heavens—\nThus it was.\nThe *Huáinán Wáng* [淮南王]’s entire family escaped—\nNo other way.\n\nBetter to be a high one,\nCreating cosmic upheavals,\nWith ancient-leaping, modern-soaring prowess.\n\nHeart and mouth in harmony,\nMouth and heart as one.\nYour name is inscribed at the *Dāntái* [丹台],\nYour merit destined for the *Zǐfǔ* [紫府].\n\nIf this is mere saintly fabrication,\nHow pitiful to deceive the virtuous!\n\nI am ashamed of my clumsy words,\nDare not speak further.\n\nLong standing among the celestial guests,\nI humbly implore, hold this in reverence.\n\n---\n**Tea Ode**\n\nI have heard—\nA single thunderclap shakes loose\nThe fragrant essence of all grades.\n\nPhoenix cakes, dragon clusters—\nManifesting the *zhìzhēn* [至真]’s rare wonder.\n\nNourished by *yīnyáng* [阴阳], flourishing,\nHeaven and Earth in misty fusion.\nDrawing the *zhèngqì* [正气] of the four seasons,\nSurpassing the *qīngwèi* [清味] of the five phases.\n\nBefore spring’s garden, it grows as precious jade,\nBefore the snow-laden peak, *Zàohuà* [造化] crafts the sacred bud.\n\nThe immortal hands pluck it—\nTimely use revealed.\nGround in the golden mortar, its aroma assaults the nose;\nBoiled in the stone kettle, its blossoms dance in waves.\n\n*Lú Quán*’s seven bowls—\nWashing away the six desires’ delusion;\n*Zhào Lǎo*’s three cups—\nCleansing all beings from their dreams.\n\nThose who love it find their spirits refreshed,\nThose who awaken find their hearts serene.\n\nDo not say this is the *shìzi* [释子]’s tradition—\nTruly, the Daoists benefit from it.\n\nCasually sharing this one essence,\nI bestow it upon all—\nReturning with joy, I humbly implore, hold this in reverence.\n\n---\n**Seven True Ones’ Chan Praises and Preface**\n\n*Pīyún Zhēnrén* [披云真人]\n\nThe *Quánzhēn* [全真] Dao—\nIts origins stretch far back.\nThough *Zēng Zǐgǔ* [曾子固] spoke of it in detail,\nLater scholars still deemed it obscure.\n\nFor *quán* [全] means all things are whole,\nAnd *zhēn* [真] means every thought is true.\nAll things whole—\nNothing is lacking, nothing incomplete.\nEvery thought true—\nNo moment untrue.\n\nYet to say all things are whole is not yet *quán* [全],\nTo say every thought is true is not yet *zhēn* [真].\nFor the *quán* in *quán* is not *quán*,\nAnd the *zhēn* in *zhēn* is not *zhēn*—\nYet nothing is un-*quán*, nothing un-*zhēn*.\n\nWhen one reaches this stage,\n*Quán* and *zhēn* become a single thread—\nYet ten thousandfold, they remain unattained.\n\nThus they can traverse mountains and rivers,\nMove cities, tread fire and water,\nEnter metal and stone,\nRoam freely, transform endlessly.\n\nThis teaching originates from *Tàishàng* [太上],\nTransmitted to *Dōnghuá* [东华].\n*Dōnghuá* passed it to *Zhèngyáng* [正阳],\n*Zhèngyáng* to *Chúnyáng* [纯阳],\n*Chúnyáng* to *Chóngyáng* [重阳].\n\nBefore *Chóngyáng*, the Dao’s seed was just sprouting,\nFew believed in it.\nAfter *Chóngyáng*, its influence spread—\nSeven generations have flourished since.\n\nHis disciple, *Dōnglái Pīyúnzǐ* [东莱披云子],\nAfter strict fasting and purification,\nComposed these *Seven True Ones’* praises.\n\nThe verses read:\n\nThe teaching’s ancestor, *Zhòngé* [重鹅],\nBoldly shed his golden seals.\nHe bore *Dòngbīn*’s [洞宾] secret precepts,\nDrank the *Gānhé*’s [甘河] sacred draught.\n\nAscending the highest steps,\nEntering the *Xuánxuán Táng* [玄玄堂].\nHe gathered the four friends from the Eastern Sea,\nLed the assembly of immortals in the Upper Realm.\n\nThe golden lotus bloomed for ten thousand ancestors,\nThe jade leaves passed on nineteen generations’ grace.\nSince the master departed,\nThe *Zhōngnán* [终南] still holds its fine winds.\n\n---\n\n**The Second**\nLeaning on *Dānyáng*’s peak, his triple braids swayed in dance.\nSecretly seizing the *Cìyù*’s hidden thread,\nAwakening to the *Fēnlí*’s parting words.\nHe cast aside half a realm’s old possessions,\nAnswering the *Sānqīng*’s celestial selection.\n\nBefore the *èrqì* had yet divided,\nHe moved where the *wǔxíng*’s reach did not extend.\nA thunderclap—he turned and returned,\nLaughing, clapping hands as petals rained.\n\n**The Third**\nBowing to the *Chángzhēn*’s lofty truth,\nUnbound by petty conventions.\nHis courage chilled autumn’s breath,\nHis stance firm as iron.\n\nHe cast off worldly ties with bold resolve,\nEntered the Dao’s gate with unyielding will.\nHe inherited *Lǎngránzǐ*’s nine-fold transformation,\nReceived *Chóngyáng*’s four-word precept.\n\nTranscending *yīnyáng*’s refining,\nUnlocking *Zàohuà*’s binding knots.\nFor ten years, he savored *Luòyáng*’s spring—\nYet casually dismissed the east wind’s tale.\n\n**The Fourth**\nMagnificent, the *Chángshēng*’s bearing stood apart,\nHis elegance unmatched.\nDisgusted by dust’s cloying stench,\nAwakened to the *Zōngfēng*’s subtle currents.\n\nHis heart roamed beyond the world’s mists and clouds,\nHis traces mingled with the market’s drums and pipes.\nHis flower-pin adorned *Làngyuàn*’s crimson,\nHis peach-cheeks tasted *Pénghú*’s jade-green.\n\nSoaring above the surging waves ten thousand feet high,\nA spark of numinous light—yet none could see.\n\n**The Fifth**\nTruly great, the *Chángchūn*’s virtue shone early,\nHis youthful purity unmatched.\nAlone, he crossed the *Hángǔ*’s winds,\nSeven years seated by *Pánxī*’s moon.\n\nSix times summoned by imperial decree,\nFour audiences at the imperial court.\nHis teachings transformed tens of kingdoms in *Xūjìng*,\nHe did not shrink from wind and snow across thirty thousand *lǐ*.\n\nOn *Bǎoxuán* Terrace, he dreamed of immortals—\nDew dripped from pine needles, revealing his return.\n\n**The Sixth**\nCalled *Cìtǐ Xuán*, he held true essence naturally.\nHis given name split from the □-bamboo,\nHis station fixed by the golden lotus.\nIn June, he stood welcoming the sun,\nIn winter, he embraced snow in tranquil rest.\n\nThough the rooster was cooked, he sang again,\nThough the poison was drunk, his life extended.\nHe received the *Jīnguó*’s four edicts,\nBowed to the *Yùhuáng*’s two proclamations.\n\nAsk the moon beneath *Tiězhí* Mountain—\nWould it share its secrets with mortals?\n\n**The Seventh**\nIn the *Tàigǔ*’s prime, fortunate to meet *Chóngyáng*,\nRising beyond mists and clouds,\nFar beyond fame and gain’s arena.\nAt *Nínghǎi*’s market, he turned back sun and moon,\nBeneath *Zhào Zhōu*’s bridge, he sat unyielding through frost.\n\nRefining the *wǔxíng* into marrow,\nBoiling the *Bāguà* for sustenance.\nEighty-four years—his debt repaid,\nEast wind turned, gazing back at his homeland.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Has the Dao of the Seven True Ones ended here?\"*\nHe replied: *\"Not yet.\"*\n\n**The Eighth**\nIs this like chasing the fading traces of a swift steed,\nOr gathering the fallen feathers of a phoenix,\nAnd claiming them as the whole of horse and phoenix?\nIs that possible?\n\nSome may laugh and bow in reverence.\nOnly the sage knows the sage,\nOnly the true knows the true,\nOnly the phoenix knows the phoenix,\nOnly the *lín* knows the *lín*.\n\nOnly the aged Daoist of the Cloud-Cloak,\nWith his wondrous years entering the Way,\nHas served the Eternal Spring for over forty seasons of frost.\n\nHe has received the most refined essence of the Seven True Ones.\nIn his revealed divine treasury of the Dao,\nI have heard and seen its depths.\n\nHis words flow as praise,\nEach utterance divinely resonant,\nNo idle speech, no empty rhetoric.\nIf scholars of the world read this,\nThey will find it a trustworthy foundation without doubt.\n\n**The \"Adrift and Free\" Ode**\nIn harmony’s ease, drifting free and unbound,\nPreserving life while avoiding worldly clamor.\nFamiliar with seagulls, swimming in boundless shallows,\nStrumming the *sè* while gathering fishermen and woodcutters.\n\nAiding the *kuī* without shame,\nHonoring glory yet unconcerned with high status.\nWithdrawing to late fishing, trusting steps with spring’s play.\n\nHis robes complete, his silk refined,\nHis virtue overflows like dew on the *liáo xiāo*.\nThe *Huángtíng* dispels all cares,\nThe *Zǐyù* awaits the final dawn.\n\nThere, he opens the three paths,\nRiding the *fúxiáo* to sport in the nine heavens.\nHis emotions flow across a short flute,\nHis firm grasp returns to youthful vigor.\n\nNo favor sought, no reliance on rank,\nContentment and leisure suffice for wealth.\nHe fulfills others’ tasks with borrowed ink,\nYet alone appreciates the *shān láo*’s worth.\n\nThus, he bathes in the waters of *Yí*,\nRejecting the noise of *Xǔ*’s jug.\nWith empty heart, he accepts the *zhuó zhuó*’s chisel,\nMingling with the coarse yet unyielding.\n\nWhen times are adverse, he knows to halt,\nIn winter’s chill, his resolve never fades.\nWith nine thoughts at the *jié yī*’s bow,\nFive willows left to their wild state.\n\nHis partner may till the fields,\nHe rests, too lazy to bend his waist.\nIrrigating the ridges, he gladly embraces the jar,\nForgetting taste, delighting in the *sháo*’s song.\n\nRemoving harm weighs less than gold and jade,\nHe devotes himself to brightening ancestral halls.\nHis lofty strides outpace the swiftest steed,\nWith wings raised, he laughs at the sparrow’s flight.\n\nCutting off learning, he wanders the *xián pǔ*’s mystery,\nSinging praises to the sacred age.\nWatching the *yú* at the curved pond,\nCovering the deer with withered bananas.\n\nBlocking the *duì* is futile in truth,\nDeep roots need not be pulled like seedlings.\nUnraveling disputes requires steady discourse,\nNurturing simplicity finds joy in boundless ease.\n\nHiding in seams of profound subtlety,\nLike the foolish, he conceals his radiant virtue.\nEntering Zen, he kneels at the *jú lóu*,\nScratching tiles with skillful *líng cháo* waves.\n\nEqualizing all things—what true gain?\nSealing the *róng*—can the world be transcended?\nAh, the race of snails in vain,\nWhile crows ascend the lofty trees.\n\nBut look at the plowman in common toil,\nHow could he bow to lesser ranks?\n\nThe phoenix’s *shēng* sounds beyond the clouds,\nSpring’s hues are teased with a staff’s tip.\n\nWho sets free the carved *yuān*?\nThe unstrung *qín* self-tunes.\nReturning to emptiness at day’s end,\nNo need for imperial carriages.\n\n**The Hall’s Precepts**\n**The White Jade Rabbit**\nHeaven, Earth, gods, spirits, and the Five Daoists,\nAll follow rules to define square and round.\nGo against, and paths lead to chaos and confusion,\nFollow, and all aligns with nature’s flow.\n\nThe Dao has existed since antiquity,\nThis Hall’s rise is recent.\nA nurturing chamber for the Daoists’ refined essence,\nA place where the sages’ burdens are cast aside.\n\nMorning and evening, incense burns,\nPraying for the longevity of the Celestial Kings and Saints.\nDawn and dusk, scriptures are expounded,\nGuarding the *tánnà*’s families in peace and fortune.\n\nThus, hidden and revealed are beyond measure,\nThe common and the sage dwell together.\nWith only a hat and a meal in a gourd,\nLiving as a *húzhōng*’s humble craftsman;\nAlone as a wild cloud or heron,\nA man of leisure beyond worldly ties.\n\nFree and unconstrained, drifting effortlessly,\nAwakening from the *huángliáng* dream in a single pillow of clear wind;\nThe *jīn gōng* furnace opened, half the window bathed in silent moonlight.\n\nWhen deeds are fulfilled and the Way complete,\nHis body’s subtlety merges with spirit’s essence.\nLying low as dragon and tiger,\nHe emerges from the muddled streets,\nRiding *luán* and *hè* to return to the cavernous halls.\n\nSome may first escape worldly snares,\nSuddenly enter the mysterious gates,\nYet their innate nature remains unclear,\nTheir heart’s foundation still in doubt.\n\nThey must diligently follow the guiding principles,\nLong practice will not stray from the model.\n\nServing teachers, respecting friends,\nRemembering the Dao, pondering the true.\nAlways focus on life and nature’s core,\nNever let ambition for fame or gain take hold.\n\nWalk with measured steps,\nSpeak without clamor.\nDo not sing of youthful allure,\nNor discuss matters of right and wrong.\nFor public or private errands,\nLights must not be seen before returning;\nSilent meditation, speechless,\nRise only when the bell tolls.\n\nArriving, clearly state your belongings,\nDeparting, hand in your items to the assembly.\nAny transgression will be met with punishment.\nMinor offenses: incense, oil, tea, and cakes,\nSevere crimes: exile to the bamboo groves below the mountain.\n\nTheft of even a single coin,\nDestruction of robes or alms bowls,\nDrinking or gambling—\nThese are forbidden in the Hall.\n\nFailure in duties shall be doubly penalized.\nThus, these precepts are proclaimed,\nLet all know them well.\n\n**Ode of Praise**\n\nThe Five Lakes’ clouds and waters,\nMingle within one hall.\n\nSince gathered are the disciples,\nMust be made clear the precepts’ framework.\nSome are ordinary, some sages—\nAt times concealed, at times revealed.\nDivine transformations are boundless,\nThe Dao’s rules are ever constant.\nIn quietude, one may tread—\nYet trust in life’s fate or Heaven’s decree.\nNo man shall drag you down,\nNo matter shall arise by chance alone.\n\nHeaven gave birth to me,\nHeaven shall take me back.\nTo heed Heaven’s will—\nWhat could be more fitting?\nTimes must be discerned,\nThings wax or wane.\nMan flourishes or declines,\nAffairs rise or fall.\nDragons do not leap in winter,\nFireflies soar when night descends.\nNoble and ignoble alike—\nEach has its season.\n\nMaster Kong pondered twice,\nZengzi reflected thrice.\nWho am I, then?\nDare I not refine myself?\n\nWords are bonds of trust,\nSun and moon are bright.\nCeasing war is strength,\nLamb’s fat makes fine broth.\nMen are wise or foolish,\nMatters great or small.\nGain comes not by hardship,\nLoss is ever swift and easy.\nDoubt not when resolved,\nDelay not when decided.\nTo hesitate when cutting—\nOnly brings disorder in return.\n\nWhen others are good, do not seek to follow,\nWhen faults are your own, do not let them linger.\nThis is called knowing the Dao—\nIs it not difficult indeed?\n\nPrecious as gold and jade,\nHeavy as hills and mountains.\nGrace like the phoenix and crane,\nFragrance like orchids and osmanthus.\nSpring comes but once,\nFlowers bloom but once.\nYouth fades never to return,\nTime passes never to come again.\n\nThe lingering notes of the crane—\nRoll them into the ninth stanza.",

the human body is hard to reclaim.\nDo not trifle with your fate—guard your future path with care.\n\nNow I briefly recount:\nFive essentials for enduring life and long vision—rely upon these.\nFirst, purify all thoughts and worries.\nSecond, renounce greed and abstain from wine, meat, and fish.\nThird, aid the poor and relieve suffering.\nFourth, always practice benevolence and charity.\nFifth, preserve your vital essence and spirit.\n\nFollow these five principles,\nPerform deeds with perfect virtue,\nAnd you shall attain the Daoist path to Penglai.\n*Golden Immortals bear alms of dew*—\n**Zhenren of Shan Mountain**,\nEnjoying the rustic village’s winds and moons, trusting the years to pass in exchange.\n\nAll day, sheltering behind the thatched gate,\nIn quiet chambers, idly browsing ancient texts with languid ease.\nSitting with composure, walking alone—\nSever all ties to fame and name.\n\nEmbrace the primordial yang,\nForget the world, dissolve in stillness,\nQi and spirit harmonized—\nAscend and descend without hindrance,\nRefine the elixir to its purest treasure,\nCultivate serenity, gentle rebirth.\nSilent and unassuming, returning to the source,\nNurture the true essence, restore the uncarved.\n\nStill and clear, tame the restless mind—\nNo more disturbance from thoughts like wild monkeys.\nFree and unrestrained, indulge in boundless joy.\nAt ease and unshackled,\nWhen deeds are fulfilled and virtue complete,\nAttain the state of no-birth—\nLet the world’s affairs rush by,\nUnconcerned with their rise and fall.\nThe world’s passions grow distant.\n\nSeekers of the Dao must not delay.\nSweet dew falls on lofty pines,\nTime flees swift—\nAlas, mortals day by day,\nCling to life without end.\n\nIf wealth surpasses Shi Chong’s stone,\nGold and jade piled high,\nWhat gain is there but boundless karma?\nDaily deceit and falsehood weigh upon the heart.\nEven the Lord of Hell calls—\nYour past sins await,\nWho will answer for you?\n\nBetter to cultivate early,\nJoin the Daoist immortals beyond the world,\nCast off the mundane.\n\nSilent and profound,\nAnother realm unfolds—\nThe boundless expanse of the *Cauldron*’s world.\nManifesting all beings,\nMoonlight shines bright—\nBehold the Dharma-realm, spirit and light as one.\nReturn, and the Clear Wind escorts you to the Celestial Emperor.\n\n*Raindrops fall*—\n**Song Pi Yun**, high mountains and flowing waters.\nAh, how few are the true kindred in this world—\nSouth of the Zhongnan Range, mist and clouds stretch ten thousand li.\nReturn, for the years grow old.\nStaff, elixir, and scrolls—\nBeyond these, what baggage do you carry?\nDelight in simplicity, uphold the family Dao of purity,\nA single luminous spirit-mirror, clear as washed.\n\nWithin its marvels, the teacher points the way—\nStrive to banish the specter of impermanence.\nSheathe the three-foot spirit-sword,\nThunderous strikes—\nThe Fire Dragon takes flight.\n\nWhen the world knows peace,\nBetween the white clouds,\nLaugh and roam at will.\nThe worldly seekers of fame and gain,\nDo not understand enduring life—\nChasing through the dusty red world.\n\n**Second Poem**\n*Seven-petal golden lotus*—\nThe Gan River’s depths, casually pierced.\nQiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Sun, and Wang,\nHao Taigu and Xu Lai—\nTwo true companions wrapped in coarse mats,\nLeak not a drop of time,\nThe teacher’s cause and effect revealed.\n\nBlooming lotus petals,\nTen thousand flowers in unison,\nFragrant mist fills the world—\n*Celestial blessings seal it.*\nThe Jiazi year passes not in vain,\nNow the Daoist immortals and heavenly beings rejoice in your awakening.\n\nThe *Quanzhen*’s household is profound,\nIndeed, within it—\nOne must forget self and others.\nBranches split nineteenfold,\nDwelling on the Dan Platform,\nSurname, title, and name all spread.\nDeeds and practice lack not a thread,\nYet the upper realms admit me not.\n\n*Playing on the Jade Terrace*—\n**Feng Zunshi**,\nDirectly pointing to the *Xuan Yuan* Path.\nAlas, the *苦海*’s delusion blinds mortals.\nBefore you, smooth and steady,\nNo peril or obstacle to hinder.\n\nCast aside all worldly ties—\nAwakening arises on its own.\nLike cranes breaking free from clouds,\nToward the boundless Daoist skies, stride with faith.\nCelebrate the immortal companions.\nWhen thirsty, drink ambrosial peaches,\nFermented in sweet wine.\nEntering and exiting star pavilions and moon halls,\nLaugh at the world’s birth and death, past and future.\n\nRiding the auspicious phoenix and blessed crane,\nAscend to the *Tai Pei*’s void—\nReturn to repose in the depths of *Bi Xia*.\nThis untrammled life is hard to share—\nEntrust it to the Penglai companions.\n\n**Third Poem: Ode to Tea**\n*One breath exchanged*—\nA thunderous shake, one sound—\nThe yellow sprout emerges.\nThe *Jade Maiden* picks it,\nSeals it in the cauldron,\nRefines it without flaw.\n\nThe iron wheel turns ten thousand times,\nThe tea leaves tremble—\nA thousand infusions reveal no end.\nLike the *Dharma’s* use,\nThe craft perfected—\nSavor it in every moment.\n\nWorthy of praise—\nThe Daoist child’s

the willows—\nMy body in a painted autumn scene.\n\nThe rain carries the sound of the shallows,\nThe wind shakes the candle’s shadow,\nMidnight still finds me reciting my scroll.\n\nCounting my parting emotions,\nWhy must they stretch to the heavens?\nA mere step’s distance, yet the path is long, and people are far.\n\nLaughing at myself alone,\nThe scholar from Luoyang,\nThe aged man of Xiangyang—\nHow often have they dreamed of me?\n\nOld now at the Floating Mound,\nComposing poetry beneath the bright moon,\nA thousand *ren* [7] of verdant sky and sharp blade.\n\nAfter the snow clears, the jade towers,\nSpring blooms on the jade mats—\nLet me host a grand feast in my old mountain home.\n\nWaiting for the rooster’s crow,\nThe sun rising over Luo Fu,\nFlying across the waves’

of the Slope,\nNightly wandering at the Red Cliff,\nA lone crane skimming past my boat to the west.\n\nThe heroes have all faded,\nMy life and fate now obscure—\nThe moon is small, the waters cold, the stars vast.\n\nHow like the fisherman,\nUnknowing of past and present,\nDrunk beside the water plant and firefly.\n\nIn dreams we meet—\nFeathers fluttering, robes swaying,\nNot necessarily this moment, not I alone.\n\nWho understands the Dao?\nAt the year’s end, the river is empty—\nThe wind’s force, the moon’s might,\nCrossing spears and composing verse by the Jiang River’s left bank.\n\nThe evening dew on my garments,\nThe late wind at the isles,\nHow many short poems and long odes have I penned?\n\nThe Jade Palace’s lofty chill,\nWhere are my old friends now?\nVast and distant, my heart knows no rest.\n\nI sigh at the journey,\nSailing the sea in a frail boat,\nMy followers not knowing who might accompany me.\n\n---\n\n**Eighth Suite**\nReturning now—\nYesterday’s

leads to the depths of mystery,\nA painted screen of emerald—\nWalking to where white clouds gather.\n\nPeaches of the world beyond, oranges by the well,\nA garden of rare mushrooms and elixir plants.\n\nLight taps on the *tan* board, the zither plays softly,\nOffering phoenix fat and lynx meat.\n\nDancing, my white hair drifts like the wind,\nStill like the old immortal companions.\n\nLook—\nPalaces of the gods, gold and jade in every hall,\nThis is the daily life of the *médhu* moth.\n\nFive-colored Penglai, the autumnal *diāo* bird,\nThere is another path to transcendence.\n\nWine ripens with Ma Gu, clouds rise from Wu Gorge,\nI bow to the Celestial Caverns and depart.\n\nLet the sea waves be clear and shallow—\nWhere is the green window, the cloudy door?\n\n---\n\n**十二**\nLight clouds, gentle winds,\nFollowing flowers and willows—\nAs if youth’s joys were still mine.\n\nHigh pavilions in the woods,\nA small carriage in the city—\nEternal peace in the Western Luo.\n\nBehold the vastness—\nSpeaking of the virtuous one,\nThe flowing water seems as it was yesterday.\n\nBut leisurely travels meet only light clouds at the sky’s edge,\nUncertain if sorrow or parting awaits.\n\nI remember well—\nAs a youth, we followed each other,\nBathing in Yi and returning,\nReciting as the swallows flew, the fish leaped.\n\nThe past rushes on—\nI am aging, yet I adjust my ways.\n\nThe *qín* strings hum in the sacred hall,\nThe old chamber’s bells and stones—\nHidden, I seem to hear them still.\n\nThe farmer tells me, “There’s work in the western fields,”\nAnd my books hang from the ox’s horns.\n\n---\n**满江红**\n*For Master Feng*\n\nSeasons hurry by—\nSuddenly, autumn’s message arrives.\nPast deeds rise—\nSo many triumphs and failures,\nA hundred years like a fleeting breath.\n\nThe scholar’s ambition unfulfilled,\nThe mountains early claimed my retreat.\nI sought the Five Lakes’ leisure, but Xiqi’s joy was rare—\nNo gain, no loss.\n\nHuman affairs—\nFull of sorrow and regret.\nThe world beyond—\nA different rhythm, a different grace.\n\nThis Penglai is serene and fair,\nJade halls, golden seals.\nBound by mortal cares, yet my heart is pure,\nMy spirit soars like the gods.\n\nSee the phoenix welcome me to the azure sky,\nThe clouds guide me home.\n\n---\n**其二**\nRain passes over the eastern suburbs,\nThe stream’s trace is shallow—\nSpring dawn in the mountain hall.\n\nWorthy of love—\nPeach blossoms in flowing water,\nLeisurely clouds, quiet crows.\n\nBeyond the world, the sun rises red,\nA single green hill at the world’s edge.\nToward the green shade, bamboo shadows roll the gate,\nForever settled.\n\nIn this quiet—\nWho knows?\n\nThe recluse of the world,\nRare in human company.\n\nLet me embrace wind and cup, moon and wine,\nDrunk on fragrant grass.\n\nGreat purpose contains the heavens and earth,\nTrue feeling stands firm in Xiqi’s depths.\nIn vain I send news to the forests and streams—\nOld in mist and clouds.\n\n---\n**其三**\nHigh sentiments through the ages\nLie in forests, streams, and winding rivers.\nKnowing this life is but a dream,\nWhy envy silk robes and grand halls?\n\nI love the moon’s reflection on the carved dock,\nThe sage does not envy gold mountains or jade.\nJoy fills the courtyard as flowers cast golden light,\nMoss stains the green.\n\nForever—\nThe east hedge’s chrysanthemum.\n\nA hollow-hearted staff,\nSouthern veranda bamboo.\nPillowed on books and *qín*, I sleep soundly,\nUnshamed, at ease.\n\nA thousand years of rise and fall—\nA spring dream awakens.\nOne stream of clouds and water—\nEnough for my life.\n\nLook at the Three Wuling Beauties,\nTheir fragrant breath.\nThe elixir fields are ripe.\n\n---\n**其四**\nMaster of the Eastern Village,\nWhere is your home—\nMountain shadows, winding streams?",

at *Blue Swallow Pass*,\nFreezing Han Xiangzi’s horse.\nScattered wildly in midair, *Longsha’s* dust.\nBlack and crimson clouds surge,\nCold winds howl again.\nFlowers bloom atop the mountain.\n\n---\n**Pure Yang True Person’s Hundred-Character Diagram**\nMy nature loves *purity and stillness*,\nTaming the *monkey-mind* with *steadfastness*.\nI drink no wine—\nI’ve abandoned desire entirely.\nI covet no wealth—\nI compete in no *qi*.\nThough seen, I do not observe;\nThough heard, I do not listen.\nI judge no one’s faults—\nOnly my own afflictions I seek.\nWhen I meet the unruly, I guard my *root-nature*.\nIn office, I avoid *renown*;\nIn private, I act with *trustworthy conduct*.\nNot counted among men,\nI escape the *chest’s oppression*.\nBlending with the light, mingling with the dust,\nI mix only with *mundane emotions*.\nWhy do I not vie for *name*?\nOnce, I debated this with *high masters*.\n\n---\n**Poem by Master Liu Langran**\nFor decades, I’ve been *cast off*, drunk on *vast cups*,\nEach day indulging my *nature* until noon.\nThe *Tail Gate* opens, the *Dirt Mound* acupuncture point transparent—\nThe *elixir furnace* divides *creation’s authority*.\nOnly this path to the *clouds* must have its way,\nFor my fate was never shaped by *Heaven*.\nDo not say the *Great Dao* is hard to grasp—\nIt’s that *common folk* refuse to study *transcendence*.\n\n---\n**Second**\nFor decades, I’ve wandered *north and south*,\nSilently practicing *mysterious principles*, refining *truth*.\nI seek not the world’s *endless things*,\nOnly to find *myself* within the *cosmos*.\nHaving awakened, I know *ebb and flow*—\n*Inner Elixir* ever flows upstream.\nEven if we meet again after a thousand years,\nIt’s as fresh as today’s new dawn.\n\n---\n**Third**\nIn *Jingluo’s* secluded stillness,\nI dwell in an ancient *observatory* east of the *moat*.\nThough *worldly emotions* stain others, not me,\nI treat *dusty affairs* as *Dao* treats them differently.\nRefining *elixirs* is no labor of a thousand days’ suffering,\nCirculating *essence* keeps my limbs ever *permeated*.\nWhat the world treasures most is precious—\nApart from the *human body*, all is *emptiness*.\n\n---\n**Fourth**\nIn my *seeking-Dao* days, chaos reigned—\nI traversed mountains and rivers like clouds.\nI studied *longevity* by chasing *external things*,\nYet never heard the *True Path*.\nMy *yang essence* lost its *harmonious qi*,\n*Gold and stone* labored in vain, heated by *foreign fire*.\nAlas, the *common folk* fail to awaken—\nThey gladly rot in *wilds*, becoming *mounds of dust*.\n\n---\n**Fifth**\nAbandon the *Nine Classics* and *Three Histories*—\nThey are of no use to the *body*.\nBetter to preserve *original harmony* and *qi*,\nAnd tend the *great elixir furnace*.\nRetaining *true essence* will save you from *old age*,\nRefining *golden substance* will pierce the *void*.\nIf you don’t know the *path of longevity*,\nWhat use are the *common folk’s* deluded natures?\n\n---\n**Sixth**\nSeeking *nobility* and *wealth* is endless—\nWhat use are *high offices* and *extreme riches*?\nBetter to wield *authority* with *light heart*,\nThan to endure *poverty* with *self-contentment*.\nLeaning on a *crooked pillow*, I let spring days stretch—\nCirculating *essence*, I spare not a hair’s decline.\nWhen we meet again beyond *things*,\nSurely we’ll be *immortals* with a *predestined bond*.\n\n---\n**Seventh**\n*True lead* and *true mercury* are not hard to find—\nIt’s that *common folk* misuse their *minds*.\n*Moon’s shadow* and *sun’s soul* are clear and easy,\nBut *wood’s essence* and *fire’s timing* run deep.\nNine years of toil refining *essence*—\n*Alchemical transformations* awaken the *five metals*.\nTo leave the world, one grain suffices—\n*Kunlun* and *Penglai* will know your *harmony*.\n\n---\n**Eighth**\nThe *double spine* and *dual channels* reach the *crown*—\nThis is the *root path* of cultivation.\nFrequently swallow *Jiachi Pool’s* *jade nectar*,\nLet *Zifu’s* *Yuan Lord* ascend.\nMake your *qi* surge through *passages and joints*,\nThen *essence* will naturally fill the *Valley Spirit*.\nWhen you attain *longevity’s realm*,\nYou’ll thank the one who first taught you.\n\n---\n**Ninth**\nHeaven’s net loosely ensnares the *ten thousand forms*,\nA pine’s fall makes *Hua Mountain* wither.\nAfter cold clouds pass, a *lonely moon* remains,\nWhen *winter snow* arrives, it faces the *Great Void*.\n*Dragon and serpent* return to *Zifu’s* *Purple Palace*,\n*Thousand-year cranes and phoenixes* descend to *Cangwu*.\nSince parting from my master,\nThere are few *true men* in *east, west, north, or south*.\n\n---\n*Langranzi*, a native of *Qi*.\nAfter following *Emperor Xuanzong of Tang* to *Shu*,\nHe encountered *Divine Master Sima Chengzhen’s* oral instructions,\nReceived the *Great Elixir* *Golden Liquid* formula,\nAnd after successful cultivation, returned to *Luoyang*.\nLocal elders say that during the *Song Endong* era,\n*Langranzi* died drunk in *Peach Blossom Alley*.\nAt the time, heavy snow fell, yet within a *ten-foot radius* of his corpse,\nNot a single flake touched the ground.\nOfficials examined the body—\nOnly *gold cicadas* entered and exited his *nose, mouth, and ears*,\nThen flew into the sky.\nAll gazed upward, and when they looked back,\nThe corpse was gone.\n\n*A Daoist of the Wànlíng Cháoyuàn*, *Zhao Yinwei*,\nCollected *Langranzi’s* poems, raised funds to carve them on stone,\nAnd spread his teachings.\nHe knocked at my door, showed me these verses,\nAnd I, having carefully examined them,\nFound them no more than *qi-circulation* and *saliva-swallowing*,\n*Nurturing yang* and *dismissing yin*—\nConsistent with my own practice.\nThus, I happily inscribed this in writing.\n*Huángtǒng* first year, third month, second day,\n*Fānghú Zhīzú* respectfully records.",

What dies?\nStill and clear, clear and still.\nSince recognizing such luminous truth,\nOne knows the nature of thought preserves the life.\n\nSeek not the True, discard not the False,\nFor in seeking and discarding, cunning arises.\nOnce cunning arises, the True is abandoned—\nYet fleeing the blade, you meet the butcher’s knife.\n\nNot yet walked, not yet seen,\nTo extinguish life is hard, yet harder still.\nWalk one step, awaken one step—\nWithout walking, vainly boasting of Chang’an’s path.\n\nYou have not yet awakened—do not force praise,\nNor claim the void is one unified house.\nWhen the heart is not yet clear, speak not of the Way,\nLike a blind man gazing at a lotus in bloom.\n\nThis side fair, that side foul,\nLuring the ox to wander recklessly.\nIf the mind’s eye is not yet bright,\nClose your eyes, still your heart, and seal your lips.\n\nNo need for hands, no need for ropes,\nNo need to bind or grasp tightly.\nWithout intent, the wind’s shadow is seized—\nSpontaneously, motion and stillness both forgotten.\n\nNeither clinging to scripture nor rejecting it,\nIn dual dissolution, inner and outer dwell.\nAbandoning the path, speech falters;\nClinging to text, you lose your own pearl.\n\nMind is Zen, nature is the Way,\nEach step contested—how much more?\nA teacher’s single finger points to the root—\nThe Stone Man claps, laughing heartily.\n\nZen as the lineage, the Way as the ancestor,\nShattering metal, wood, water, fire, earth.\nLuminous radiance interpenetrates true void—\nYet laughs at one, two, three, four, five.\n\nLineage and method both unified,\nOnly true practice and true virtue suffice.\nWhen virtue and practice are fulfilled,\nOnly a point illuminates the cold sky.\n\nNeither Way nor Zen,\nFathomless and obscure—naturally unified.\nAll things stripped bare by the pure eye,\nThe void resounds, boundless and bright.\n\n---\n\n**悟真歌**\n*Féng Zūnshī*\n\nAwakened within awakening, enlightened within insight,\nA single spark of luminous light, unobstructed.\nUnleash the fierce flame to illuminate *Sādhāra*’s world,\nThe *Dharma-realm* stretches vast, yet stands alone revealed.\n\nThese subtle messages, so profound,\nA wooden man points afar—clouds return in vain.\nThis mystic gate defies description,\nYet seen in the moment, forgotten at once.\n\nNot the tangles of an old woman’s tongue,\nBut the genuine compassion of wondrous truth.\nA moon’s wheel lifted by a staff,\nA furnace’s red flame cradling spring’s snow.\n\nI was originally a *Great Awakening* immortal,\nWith fate, I grasped the ancestor’s Zen.\nReturning, a song—no one responds,\nJade bamboos and yellow flowers, natural and free.\n\nIn the painted hall, incense smoke drifts fine,\nIn vain I sigh like *Manjuśrī* inquiring of illness.\nAt *Caoxi*’s stream, the moon is bright, the wind pure,\nGolden lotuses bloom across *Jeta*’s grove.\n\nShouldering the tiger-staff, I return home,\nSnow seals the mountain path—no passage now.\nWho at this moment understands my ease?\nOnly the few branches of plum will know.\n\nSince recognizing the Way of Chang’an,\nI love not idle flowers nor wild grass.\nDeep in the night, the *kukku* cries on the bough,\nBefore the wine-jar, spring arrives anew.\n\nAt home, effortless joy in non-action,\nEvery touch reveals sacred form.\nNot the thousand-eyed compassion,\nYet the jade maiden plucks forth ancient *Māni*.\n\nWhat spell could illuminate this truth?\nFathomless, obscure—yet dimly glimpsed.\nOrdinary beings fail to recognize this *Tathāgata*,\nA lion’s den for the three ages’ Buddhas.\n\nTrue leisure, true joy—whom to praise?\nAll are *crane-herons* trapped in a well’s depths.\nA lone *kōkin* plucked to silence,\nGreen mountains still lock mist and cloud.\n\n---\n\n**证道歌**\n*Lǚ Dòngbīn*\n\nAwakening to the True yet failing to grasp life—\nThis is the first sickness of cultivation.\nMerely cultivating *xìng* while neglecting the elixir,\nA myriad kalpas of yin-spirits struggle to attain sainthood.\n\nGrasping life’s foundation yet lost in ancestral nature,\nLike a mirror without treasure—useless.\nA man of heaven’s span, seizing yin and yang as his foundation.\nNature and life complete, profound yet deeper still—\nA ship crossing the ocean’s surging waves.\n\nCapturing alive the dragon-serpent’s form,\nOnly then does the artisan’s skill prove true.\n\n---\n\n**得道歌**\n*Jǐngyáng*\n\nThe Way is hard to enter, hard to seek,\nEasy to speak of—who can attain?\nFalse paths deceive the world in myriad forms,\nA thousand paths to the Way, yet only one true.\n\nSome who study the Way now refuse to bow—\nHow pitiful!\nHiding from heaven, earth, and man,\nBefore attaining, they boast their success.\n\nTo become an immortal is not so hard,\nYet immortals must be born of immortal essence.\nIf not of immortal nature, do not presume,\nFor every move invites yin-demons’ grudges.\n\nThis matter is no small art,\nRelying solely on virtue and conduct to shock the dark.\n\nSever delusion, extinguish greed,\nEach step grounded in firm resolve.\nIf you grasp your true nature and heart as one,\nThen I dare speak truly of the essence.\n\nCultivating the Golden Elixir is easy to begin,\nYet mastering *Zhōngyōng* and the *Yì* is key.\nAll doing and striving are ultimately vain,\nSpeaking of dragons only ends in tiger’s harm.\n\nAt the origin, movement stirs the body,\nIf further confused, punishment follows.\nEver recall the undivided chaos before differentiation,\nMysteries unspeakable—nature’s heart is clear.\n\nThe body’s every part belongs to yin,\nYet one thing holds yang-essence—man does not know.\nRound and steady, it follows like a shadow,\nNeither void nor form, yet neither color nor substance.\nDispersed through all things, filling heaven and earth,\nWithin one thing lies the *Tàijí*.\nRetreating, it hides in the profound unity of nature—\nSeen, yet unseen; sought, yet unfound.\n\nMy elixir’s secret is uniquely mine,\nNo need for days, months, or years.\nNo fire’s timing, no adding or subtracting,\nNo separation of self and other, flaw or merit.\nNeither birth nor death, nor anything to cultivate or speak of.\nWhen hungry, eat; when tired, sleep.\nAt leisure, sit in meditation; when lazy, rest.",

eyes.\n\nNeither coming nor going,\nMastering the Six Powers in freedom;\nNeither birth nor death,\nTranscending the Three Realms in solitary perfection.\n\nUnshaken by clamor,\nUnbound by ease.\nThe five sects’ disciples,\nCling to fabricated knowledge;\nThe One Vehicle’s adherents,\nAlso indulge in illusion.\n\nOnly when ever-present clarity shines,\nAnd all burdens are released—\nA thousand winds through the pines,\nStone women sing between the branches;\nThree moonbeams on the ridge,\nPastoral boys tumble in the light.\n\nInnate wisdom dawns,\nSudden luminosity unfolds.\nWhen circumstances arise, nature manifests;\nBefore forms, the heart must fade.\n\nThe Four Symbols merge,\nThe Three Talents harmonize.\nGreen waters flow eternally—\nThough you rot and decay;\nBlue mountains stand firm—\nAs clouds drift, they drift away.\nEverlasting through ancient and present,\nUnwithering, unperishing.\n\nThe dull are ensnared by sound and color,\nThe enlightened transcend all existence.\nScattering wind and cloud,\nCaressing stars and constellations.\nThe hollow lute’s melody—\nWooden horses roar before the hall;\nThe snow-melting tune is rare—\nJade dragons race beneath the sea.\n\nDo not seek East-West Bodhisattvas,\nNor hunt South-North Amitābha.\nWherever the eye turns, the Dharma-realm is present—\nWhere is there no Chan?\n\nWhen one grasps this truth,\nOnly then may one attain suchness.\n\nDwelling in dust yet transcending it,\nNot falling into the Six Demons’ snares.\nEncountering origin on all sides,\nSilent illumination returns to primal purity.\n\nOld women’s gossip, a thousand eons of bone-trading;\nDirect pointers to the numinous source—\nA single absolute utterance.\n\nSeizing freedom, killing and living stand alone.\nWhite clouds and green cliffs—\nEvery peak is true suchness;\nEmerald bamboo and golden flowers—\nEvery thing is pure awakening.\n\nErasing all boundaries, encompassing the great thousand—\nHe who displays the flower to the assembly\nTruly overreaches;\nHe who shouts at the Buddha and curses the Ancestors\nAlso errs.\n\nWho understands the step-by-step lotus?\nReturning from the Deer Park,\nThe moon fills the riverboat.\n\nDrawing forth one’s own family wind,\nInstantly surpassing the Ten Bhūmis;\nShattering the stubborn void’s illusion,\nAlone feasting the heavenly hosts.\n\nA worthless fool dares to bicker—\nAll are but dregs;\nWho gnaws at public cases\nCannot fathom profound truth.\nOff by a hair’s breadth,\nMissed by a thousand leagues.\n\nThe Wooden Man says:\n*To know the Western Intent,\nOne must drain the marrow of the Golden Nirmāṇa Devas.*\n\n**On Recognizing Heart and Mind**\n\nIf one seeks cultivation,\nFirst recognize heart and mind,\nThen awaken nature.\n\nWhat is heart?\nWhat is mind?\nThat which perceives is heart;\nThousands of thoughts, millions of musings—this is mind.\n\nMind arises from thought,\nHeart is born from things.\nThe root of arising and generation\nLies within the inch-square.\n\nThis inch-square—\nThe original true heart.\nHeart has no heart,\nMind has no mind.\n\nBecause familiar scenes are hard to forget,\nThe heart drifts, the mind stirs,\nAnd true heart is obscured, unseen.\nOne must still the heart, settle the mind,\nAnd inwardly observe the heart.\n\nThe stillness, unmoving—this is *dhyāna*;\nAwareness within stillness—this is *prajñā*.\n*Dhyāna* is essence,\n*Prajñā* is function.\nWhen both are complete,\nThey never wane day by day.\n\n**On Serenity**\n\nTo love broadly is to be muddled—\nWho can cherish purity?\nEntangled in myriad cares,\nI alone keep one life serene.\nBreak free from the deepest chains,\nEver dwell in tranquility;\nAvoid the gnats and flies’ snares,\nAwaken to luminous clarity.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*Cut all worldly ties,\nUphold the primal order.*\nTo play in the boundless void of Great Purity,\nOne must root deeply and stand firm;\nTo dwell in true simplicity and leisure,\nOne must rejoice in eternal life and keen vision.\n\nWhen this truth is known,\nThe heart becomes clear as autumn water;\nAll movements in time\nAre subtle as spring winds rising.\n\nStanding alone, yet upright—\nSilent, yet present.\nUnblemished yet not rigid—\nLike a mirror revealing beauty and flaw;\nLuminous yet without favor—\nLike the moon illuminating heaven and earth.\n\nUpright in singular nature,\nCalm in the Six Roots.\nNuminous purity stands aloof,\nLike pine and cypress in virtue;\nLawful vastness unfolds,\nBeyond the gate of the Mysterious and Primordial.\n\nIn the world, the body returns to the lone cloud,\nEmotions rise like wild cranes.\nSubtle and wondrous, it hides mountains in marshes;\nBeyond thought, it buries elixir in valleys.\nPure and transparent, boundless and free—\nThe spirit soars to Guishan’s realm;\nSelf and objects forgotten,\nThe steps tread the void’s expanse.\n\nUltimately, this is not the private domain of the Sage—\nIt is what one makes of it.\nIf one does not abandon name and gain,\nHow can one awaken to the rare and lofty?\n\nThe great sage speaks leisurely,\nEchoing the South Mountain’s words;\nThe petty man frets endlessly,\nHearing Confucius’ teachings in vain.\n\nAs for those who practice Chan amid desire,\nCarrying their families’ burdens while preaching subtlety—\nThey must earn the respect of the lowest fool,\nAnd avoid the scorn of the virtuous.\n\nOne must only quietly cultivate,\nTurning toward leisure’s reflection.\nTo exhaust emptiness and uphold stillness firmly—\nThis is Laozi’s family tradition;\nTo discard limbs and abandon cleverness—\nThis is Yan Yuan’s essential key.\n\nWhen heart and method both vanish,\nLife and death are cast aside.\nThrough pure refinement, the Dao is perfected;\nThrough empty leisure, the Mysterious is pierced.\n\nHaving abandoned the causes of defilement,\nThe universe grows desolate;\nSealing the breath of non-action,\nOne laughs among the clouds.\n\nStrange—\nAnts toil for food, moths perish in flame.\nWhy cling to this sinking suffering?\nWho would perfect virtue’s nature?\n\nAlas—\nBetter to hear early of leisure and

the tenfold heights of the High Immortals\nDescend to wander in this mortal world;\nThat the Great Explication of the Three Sovereigns’ ancient Way\nHarmonizes with the transformations of humanity?\n\nThe roots of virtue permeate all schools,\nYet the heart returns to the One Rectitude.\nThose who abandon the secular world sever ties with kin and love;\nThose who endure hardship rejoice in Heaven’s decree and accept fate.\nThus, Perfect Truth is both learning and refining the nature.\nWorldly fame and wealth, sensual pleasures—\nView them as floating scum upon water;\nWisdom and insight—\nHold them sacred as the foremost saints of the Teaching.\n\nFor indeed, learning is not a rigid possession,\nBut a quest for the Great Way.\nAmassing abundant virtue,\nOne extends compassion through skilful means;\nDeeply cultivating and preserving,\nOne attains inner success.\nTo dwell in non-action’s clarity,\nTo seek the Way’s unity—\nObjects are distinct as the bright moon in a clear pool;\nEach response appears as the gentle wind through swaying grass.\nAll must be discerned in high and low,\nAnd lifted in full awareness.\nLearners have causes and fruits;\nThose who realize transcend birth and death.\nIn utmost stillness and harmony,\nIn utmost firmness and purity—\nUnifying the myriad virtues to interact with the world,\nNever forsaking mercy;\nProclaiming the Three Teachings to awaken the lost,\nStill honoring the wise and virtuous.\nIn essence, begging is no shame,\nNor is utter poverty a sorrow.\nBending oneself to benefit others,\nOne bestows kindness upon the aged and destitute;\nUpholding lofty resolve and integrity,\nOne scorns kings and nobles with laughter.\nThis is the Perfect Truth’s heroic sage,\nThe Dao-realized Immortal stream.\n\nSudden enlightenment to Heaven’s mechanisms,\nBroadcasts the Mysterious Wind through the Sacred Realm;\nWidespread offerings of fragrant bait,\nUniversally seeks the knowing companions for the journey to the Isle of the Sea.\nThus, seeing clearly into things awakens the heart,\nAnd knowing emptiness realizes the Dao.\n\n**[Learning] the Perfect Truth’s Dao and methods,**\nOne must adhere to the teachings of Zhong and Lü;\n**[Taking] the Great Way’s Mysterious principles,**\nOne must strictly follow the doctrines of Huang and Lao.\nIn pure stillness and simplicity,\nRefining the Vermilion Elixir to extract Silver Threads;\nIn pristine subtlety,\nForging the Golden Treasure in the Cinnabar Cauldron.\nDiscarding false pretenses,\nRevealing the natural.\nAttaining the ever-more-wondrous essence of reality,\nObtaining the utterly complete True Function.\nFive paths of silver clouds pierce the celestial vault,\nOne radiant wheel of moon illuminates the sky.\nWith crane’s carriage and golden scriptures,\nOne ascends to the Nine Yang Palace;\nWith peach wine and jade nectar,\nOne takes seat among the Ten Thousand Saints.\n\nAlas—\nSome remain in foolish delusion,\nEngaged in petty disputes of self and others.\nThose who declaim scriptures and proclaim the Teachings,\nDo they truly grasp the Mysterious?\nThose who deceive the middle and lower ranks,\nDo not understand cause and effect.\nOne must depart the Fire Hall’s favors and the Mountain of Merit,\nAnd withdraw from the bonds of name and gain.\nTruly, if one wishes to know Perfect Truth’s essence,\nSudden enlightenment to emptiness is the path.\n\n**The Emperor’s Ode to the Dao**\n\nWithin the Three Teachings, the Dao alone is most exalted.\nAbove, it does not bow to the Son of Heaven;\nBelow, it does not pay respects to ministers and officials.\nAvoiding the secular world, it hides its traces;\nEscaping the worldly net, it refines the True.\nScorning the forests and streams,\nIt rejects fame and profit;\nRejoicing in the mountains and valleys,\nIt forgets disgrace and glory.\nCrowning with the Star Cap, it blazes like the sun;\nWearing coarse hemp robes, it nurtures eternal spring.\nSome shave their heads and bare their feet,\nOthers tie their hair in a knot and wrap it in cloth.\nPlucking Immortal flowers to weave hats,\nFolding wild grasses to spread mats.\nDrinking from the Sweet Springs to rinse the teeth,\nFeasting on pine nuts to prolong life.\nSinging with hand-drums, dancing until clouds gather—\nWith mountain companions, sharing tea in friendly conversation;\nBy riverside gatherings, lifting cups to discuss ancient texts.\nLaughing at the vulgarity of lavish wealth,\nRejoicing in the ease of humble poverty.\nNot a single hair’s obstruction,\nNor a speck of entanglement.\nSome gather in threes to seek the Mysterious and inquire of the Dao,\nOthers converse in pairs on past and present.\nDiscussing past and present,\nThey sigh over the rise and fall of ancient worthies;\nSeeking the Mysterious and inquiring of the Dao,\nThey clarify the essence of their own True Nature.\nEnduring the shifts of cold and heat,\nCompleting the nine revolutions of the celestial tortoise and hare.\nGraying hair returns to youth,\nWhite hair turns green.\nCarrying a bamboo lunchbox, they enter markets to beg for meals;\nGathering herbs to heal the world and aid humanity.\nSome relieve suffering and benefit beings,\nOthers restore life from death.\nThose who cultivate the Immortal Way have bones of utmost firmness and refinement,\nThose who attain the Dao have spirits of peerless luminosity.\nForecasting fortune and misfortune, directing strange omens,\nDetermining calamity and blessing through subtle investigation of human affairs.\nExpounding the Dao and elevating the Supreme Sage’s orthodox Teaching,\nApplying talismans to dispel the world’s malevolent influences.\nSubduing demonic forces with a wave of the hand,\nDisplaying *qi* at the Gate of

      "translated_text": "「Five volumes of profound mysteries were received through direct transmission,\nAnd seven orifices of spiritual insight revealed his merit.\n\nSince drinking the waters of the Gansha River,\nHis heart opened vastly, and his faculties became clear.\n\nAt forty-eight, he encountered the True Teaching,\nAnd abandoned the world to embrace the Dao, hidden within tombs.\nHe observed the inner landscape of reality,\nAnd only then comprehended the Five Phases’ transformative power.\n\nPiercing through the illusory and false forms,\nHe no longer inquired of mortal omens and portents.\n\nOnce again meeting the harmonious Li and dwelling in Liu Jiang,\nThe three of them resided together through three winters.\n\nIn thought, he reflected on the teachings of Qiu Liu, Tan Zhong, and Ma Yu,\nAnd renamed himself as *Wang Haifeng* [王害风].\n\nFire consumed his thatched hut, and he left the land of Qin,\nDeparting the southeastern regions to descend to the east.\n\nThree thousand miles away, he found a kindred soul,\nAnd through nine transformations entered the Southern Capital.\n\nThe Master summoned his disciples with personal instructions:\n“I shall return to the Pengleng [蓬瀛].”\n\nIn the tenth year of the Dading era (庚寅), at fifty-eight,\nHis lifespan ended.\n\nAt the *Cha Zi* [查子] shop, he ascended the path to Immortality,\nLeaving behind the ancient traditions of the *Quanzhen* [全真] school.\n\nSeven golden lotuses bloom at the hall’s entrance,\nThe *Changchun* [长春] and *Changjiao* [长教] lineages flourish within.\n\nThe teachings of *Quanzhen* [全真] in the *Qinghe* [清和] era are passed on,\nAnd the *Hao* [浩然] sect thrives atop *Panshan* [盘山], south of the peaks.\n\n*Dongzhen* [洞真], clad in white clouds, is the *Piyun* [披云] Master,\nWith boundless desirelessness, he ranks highest among all Immortal masters.\n\nEighteen senior masters gather here,\nFrom the *Gengzi* [庚子] era, their deeds began.\n\nDisciples from all under heaven come to lend their strength,\nDaoists across the world contribute their efforts.\n\nHeaven bestowed the craftsman *Cao Tidi* [曹提点],\nAnd the halls were built in the *Shuizhu* [水竹] village.\n\nLofty and majestic, they rise a hundred feet high,\nJade-tiled roofs and tortoiseshell-like windows touch the heavens.\n\nThe southern mountain’s lion-like beast spits water,\nFour beasts stand proud, their roars like winds of thunder.\n\nThousands of beams and arches arranged in the Eight Trigrams,\nFive ridges and six beasts aligned with the Nine Palaces.\n\nFrom afar, it resembles the summit of *Xumishan* [须弥],\nAnd in the distance, it mirrors the grandeur of *Taihuafeng* [太华峰].\n\nAbove, it connects with clouds and the Northern Dipper,\nBelow, it descends to the Nine Abodes and Nine Springs.\n\n〔Missing verse〕 The eight rivers behind the ridge all flow east.\nA thousand rays of dawn enshroud the precious halls,\nA thousand wisps of jade mist veil the ornate palaces.\n\nOnce, he saw cranes and phoenixes dancing in the sky,\nAnd heard celestial music resounding from the Heavenly Palace.\nAll manifestations gathered to pay homage to the Jade Emperor,\nThe saints and Immortals presented offerings to the Three Pure Ones.\n\nDeep within the crimson glow and violet mist, sealed tight,\nWhite clouds and auspicious *qi* [气] are firmly locked within.\n\nScattered red peach blossoms and green bamboo intermingle,\nThousands of verdant trees and azure pines stand in harmony.\n\nHe wandered the boundless realms of heaven and earth,\nAnd found no place more rare than the *Wang Zhongyang* [重阳] *Wanshou* [万寿] Palace.\n\nAt the hall’s entrance, *Zhao Zhenren* [赵真人] speaks:\n\n*\"The True One of the Primordial Dao,\nOpens wide the gate to all marvelous mysteries.\n\nThe *Quanzhen* [全真] Way is fully realized,\nAnd its teachings universally benefit all beings.\n\nThe fairy maidens of the *Yaochi* [瑶池],\nThe golden lotuses of *Wang Zhongyang*—seven blooms.\n\nThe *Langyuan* [阆苑] and *Jingong* [璚宫],\nThe *Changchun* [长春] lineage’s jade flowers—ten thousand leaves.\n\nThough branches may diverge in detail,\nAll paths ultimately return to the root.\n\nThough sects may vary in flow,\nAll rivers eventually merge into the sea.\n\nHe sets forth teachings in every direction,\nGathering clouds of friends from the four seas.\n\nHe sparks the *yuan* [缘] of the Dao in every place,\nSummoning the misty companions of the Three Mountains.\n\nThatched huts and humble dwellings,\nAll become adorned with precious halls and ornate palaces.\n\nRough hemp robes and coarse attire,\nAre graced with star-crowned caps and moon-trimmed cloaks.\n\nIt can be said that humans can magnify the Dao,\nExpounding the rules of the ancient sages.\n\nThe Dao’s methods naturally align with humanity,\nOpening the eyes of future generations.\n\nAt the *Liao Zhen* [了真] Hall, no trace of worldly attachment remains;\nUnder the *Wanxing* [万行] banner, all are urged to exert their efforts.\n\nThose above must act with boundless compassion,\nThose below must always hold reverence and obedience.\n\nWorldly disputes cloud the mind,\nAnd fail to grasp the essence of the *Quanzhen* [体玄] Way’s tradition.\n\nDaoist insight unites in harmony,\nFollowing the ancient practice of refining the *Danjiao* [丹肠].\n\nFrom early times, he was a transcendent Immortal,\nNow he serves as the Master’s *fahuai* [法眷].\n\nDo not linger in the fleeting dust of mortal concerns,\nNor mock the precious pearls of a thousand sages.\n\nIn life, he shared in cultivating the Dao’s fruits,\nAnd together ascended to transcend the mortal ranks.\n\nThe *Chujia* [出家] scholar, with clear vision, delves into the depths.\nThe *Licheng* [离尘] warrior, with pure heart, illuminates the path.\n\nI humbly pray for your revered care.\n\n*Feng Zunshi* [冯尊师]’s second verse:\n\nThe Supreme Dao is boundless and profound,\nThe wondrous Dao is rare and elusive.\nBefore heaven and earth, it was already present,\nNot confined to words or texts.\n\nIts light is luminous and void-pervading,\nFilling all ten directions.\nIts purity is clear and spiritually resonant,\nFlowing through the Three Realms.\n\nIn endless transformations and changes,\nIt encompasses and governs yin and yang.\nIts essence and function are eternally true,\nLimitless and beyond measure.\n\nYet how can mortals, ensnared by heavy veils,\nBear its weight?\n\nValuing the ancient while scornful of the present,\nThey fabricate knowledge and understanding.\nThey debate the *Dharma* [法] and practice Zen,\nBut only open side doors to the Way.\n\nFrom then on, the *Taiji* [太极] Primordial simplicity was lost,\nAnd the teachings were divided into three gates.\nWithin the realm of emotions and perceptions,\nThey could not return to the origin.\n\nTo see these people thus,\nOne must deeply pity them.\n\nTherefore, the Master widely opened the *fangbian* [方便],\nAnd broadly spread the *cihang* [慈航] of compassion.\n\nHe universally rescued beings from suffering,\nFreeing them from the six realms of transmigration.\n\nHe guided them back to the True Path,\nAnd let them revel once more in the *Hongmeng* [鸿蒙] of primordial simplicity.\n\nHe broke open the gate of serene detachment,\nAnd wandered freely through the *Qingdu* [清都] and *Jianguo* [降阙] of the celestial realms.\n\nOn the Five Clouds Platform,\nHe clearly transmitted the *Shuimi* [黍米] and *Xuanzhu* [玄珠];\nBeside the Nine Luminaries Tower,\nHe raised high the *Han guang* [含光] treasure sword.\n\nIn boundless expanse, he moves with effortless freedom,\nPure and unobstructed, like the void itself.\n\nIn action and stillness, he transcends *wuwei* [无为],\nMerging into the undifferentiated essence.\n\nThus, he can sweep away the *Sadā* [萨埵],\nAnd playfully engage with *Bodhi* [菩提].\n\nNeither death nor birth remain,\nNo excess, no deficiency.\n\nBoth saints and mortals are released,\nEmbracing the vastness of emptiness and form.\n\nEven if the *nirūna* [泥牛] bellows at the moon,\nOr the wooden horse whinnies in the wind,\nOr the *lòutòu* [漏透] snares the mind,\nOr the *jiāxiào* [作家] becomes a laughingstock—\n\nWith fiery words, he scolds the blue-eyed barbarian monks;\nIn silent illumination, he shatters the golden-maned lion.\n\nThe Five-Leaf Flower blooms in full,\nAnd the Three Mysteries are gently brushed aside.\nHe frees the *Yuanshi* [元始] from its constraints,\nAnd withdraws the *Muni* [牟尼]’s artifices.\n\nHe unfurls the *xiàngwàng* [象罔],\nAnd tramples the *nièpán* [涅盘].\n\nHe severs the *Caoxi* [曹溪] lineage,\nAnd leisurely resides in *Zhengpu* [郑圃].\n\nBefore *Dàmó* [达磨] and *Luóshì* [罗什] were born,\nThe *Nanhua* [南华] teachings already repelled *Qùkè* [御寇].\n\nAlas, how scholars forget their roots and chase after branches,\nAbandoning their own to favor outsiders.\n\nThey do not knock at the *Chōngxū* [冲虚] gate,\nBut cling to foreign *Dharma* [梵语].\n\nTheir homeland is secure,\nYet they seek validation in the West.\n\nIn vain, they wear out their straw sandals,\nSearching for what, exactly?\n\nThe stone lion’s heart has been gouged out,\nAnd the wild fox’s drool seeps into the marrow.\n\n」",

obscure.\n\nFor *quán* [全] means all things are whole,\nAnd *zhēn* [真] means every thought is true.\nAll things whole—\nNothing is lacking, nothing incomplete.\nEvery thought true—\nNo moment untrue.\n\nYet to say all things are whole is not yet *quán* [全],\nTo say every thought is true is not yet *zhēn* [真].\nFor the *quán* in *quán* is not *quán*,\nAnd the *zhēn* in *zhēn* is not

*lín*.\n\nOnly the aged Daoist of the Cloud-Cloak,\nWith his wondrous years entering the Way,\nHas served the Eternal Spring for over forty seasons of frost.\n\nHe has received the most refined essence of the Seven True Ones.\nIn his revealed divine treasury of the Dao,\nI have heard and seen its depths.\n\nHis words flow as praise,\nEach utterance divinely resonant,\nNo idle speech, no empty rhetoric.\nIf scholars of the world read this,\nThey will find it a trustworthy foundation without doubt.\n\n**The \"Adrift and Free\" Ode**\nIn harmony’s ease, drifting free and unbound,\nPreserving life while avoiding worldly clamor.\nFamiliar with seagulls, swimming in boundless shallows,\nStrumming the *sè* while gathering fishermen and woodcutters.\n\nAiding the *kuī* without shame,\nHonoring glory yet unconcerned with high status.\nWithdrawing to late fishing, trusting steps with spring’s play.\n\nHis robes complete, his silk refined,\nHis virtue overflows like dew on the *liáo xiāo*.\nThe *Huángtíng* dispels all cares,\nThe *Zǐyù* awaits the final dawn.\n\nThere, he opens the three paths,\nRiding the *fúxiáo* to sport in the nine heavens.\nHis emotions flow across a short flute,\nHis firm grasp returns to youthful vigor.\n\nNo favor sought, no reliance on rank,\nContentment and leisure suffice for wealth.\nHe fulfills others’ tasks with borrowed ink,\nYet alone appreciates the *shān láo*’s worth.\n\nThus, he bathes in the waters of *Yí*,\nRejecting the noise of *Xǔ*’s jug.\nWith empty heart, he accepts the *zhuó zhuó*’s chisel,\nMingling with

state.\n\nHis partner may till the fields,\nHe rests, too lazy to bend his waist.\nIrrigating the ridges, he gladly embraces the jar,\nForgetting taste, delighting in the *sháo*’s song.\n\nRemoving harm weighs less than gold and jade,\nHe devotes himself to brightening ancestral halls.\nHis lofty strides outpace the swiftest steed,\nWith wings raised, he laughs at the sparrow’s flight.\n\nCutting off learning, he wanders the *xián pǔ*’s mystery,\nSinging praises to the sacred age.\nWatching the *yú* at the curved pond,\nCovering the deer with withered bananas.\n\nBlocking the *duì* is futile in truth,\nDeep roots need not be pulled like seedlings.\nUnraveling disputes requires steady discourse,\nNurturing simplicity finds joy in boundless ease.\n\nHiding in seams of profound subtlety,\nLike the foolish, he conceals his radiant virtue.\nEntering Zen, he kneels at the *jú lóu*,\nScratching tiles with skillful *líng cháo* waves.\n\nEqualizing all things—what true gain?\nSealing the *róng*—can the world be transcended?\nAh, the race of snails in vain,\nWhile crows ascend the lofty trees.\n\nBut look at the plowman in common toil,\nHow could he bow to lesser ranks?\n\nThe phoenix’s *shēng* sounds beyond the clouds,\nSpring’s hues are teased with a staff’s tip.\n\nWho sets free the carved *yuān*?\nThe unstrung *qín* self-tunes.\nReturning to emptiness at day’s end,\nNo need for imperial carriages.\n\n**The Hall’s Precepts**\n**The White Jade Rabbit**\nHeaven, Earth, gods, spirits, and the Five Daoists,\nAll follow rules to define square and round.\nGo against, and paths lead to chaos and confusion,\nFollow, and all aligns with nature’s flow.\n\nThe Dao has existed since antiquity,\nThis Hall’s rise is recent.\nA nurturing chamber for the Daoists’ refined essence,\nA place where the sages’ burdens are cast aside.\n\nMorning and evening, incense burns,\nPraying for the longevity of the Celestial Kings and Saints.\nDawn and dusk, scriptures are expounded,\nGuarding the *tánnà*’s families in peace and fortune.\n\nThus, hidden and revealed are beyond measure,\nThe common and the sage dwell together.\nWith only a hat and a meal in a gourd,\nLiving as a *húzhōng*’s humble craftsman;\nAlone as a wild cloud or heron,\nA man of leisure beyond worldly ties.\n\nFree and unconstrained, drifting effortlessly,\nAwakening from the *huángliáng* dream in a single pillow of clear wind;\nThe *jīn gōng* furnace opened, half the window bathed in silent moonlight.\n\nWhen deeds are fulfilled and the Way complete,\nHis body’s subtlety merges with spirit’s essence.\nLying low as dragon and tiger,\nHe emerges from the muddled streets,\nRiding *luán* and *hè* to return to the cavernous halls.\n\nSome may first escape worldly snares,\nSuddenly enter the mysterious gates,\nYet their innate nature remains unclear,\nTheir heart’s foundation still in doubt.\n\nThey must diligently follow the guiding principles,\nLong practice will not stray from the model.\n\nServing teachers, respecting friends,\nRemembering the Dao, pondering the true.\nAlways focus on life and nature’s core,\nNever let ambition for fame or gain take hold.\n\nWalk with measured steps,\nSpeak without clamor.\nDo not sing of youthful allure,\nNor discuss matters of right and wrong.\nFor public or private errands,\nLights must not be seen before returning;\nSilent meditation, speechless,\nRise only when the bell tolls.\n\nArriving, clearly state your belongings,\nDeparting, hand in your items to the assembly.\nAny transgression will be met with punishment.\nMinor offenses: incense, oil, tea, and cakes,\nSevere crimes: exile to the bamboo groves below the mountain.\n\nTheft of even a single coin,\nDestruction of robes or alms
