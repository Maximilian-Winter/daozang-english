  "full_translation": "**Preface to the *Returning to the Source Sutra***\n\nThe Tai family, yearning for the true lineage, traversed sacred realms and studied the correct Dharma, ever holding the salvation of the world as their heart’s intent. They devoted themselves wholly to the Three Treasures, with particular emphasis on the cultivation of life. For it is said that learning immortality is most simple, yet people make it difficult for themselves; shedding the dust is not hard, yet people find it arduous—how deeply lamentable!\n\nAs the ancients declared:\n*\"Clouds obscure the moon of wisdom,\nKarmic winds stir the sea of stillness.\"*\n\nOnce, at a posting station, I encountered my late master, the Perfected One of Purple Yang. In words of utmost simplicity—no more than half a phrase—the efficacy of his verification was revealed in but a moment. Thus did I know that immortality could indeed be learned, and joy arose within me.\n\nWhen the golden elixir congealed and the sacred embryo reached completion, Tai composed the *Returning to the Source* in eighty-one five-character quatrains, bestowing them upon later learners to awaken early to the true essence. Let none wait until old age, when lead is empty and mercury scarce! Urgently, one must awaken, seek a master, inquire into the Dao, refine the golden elixir, ascend together the immortal ranks, transform and ascend in flight—this is my sincerest hope.\n\n—Preface by Shi Tai of Apricot Grove\n\n**Five-Character Quatrains**\n**Chapter One**\n\n**Chapter One**\nLead and mercury form the true body,\nYin and yang unite in the Great Primal.\nSimply know the practice of two eights—\nThen may you refine the golden elixir.\n\n**Chapter Two**\nMercury is the marrow of the Azure Dragon,\nLead is the fat of the White Tiger.\nGather them into the crucible,\nHarvesting requires knowing the time.\n\n**Chapter Three**\nThe Maiden rides the lead tiger,\nThe Metal Elder mounts the mercury dragon.\nWith *jia* and *geng* clarifying the true command,\nRefine until the furnace glows crimson.\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe serpent’s soul seizes the dragon’s marrow,\nThe tortoise’s spirit restrains the tiger’s essence.\nWithin the Flower Pool’s divine water,\nA single bud of jade fat blooms.\n\n**Chapter Five**\nWhite snow flies in the jasper garden,\nYellow sprouts emerge in the jade grove.\nIf only one can shape it like the crescent moon,\nWhere then to refine the red lead?\n\n**Chapter Six**\nThe medicinal ingredients open the primordial chaos,\nThe fire-tending tempers the vast expanse.\nAfter ten months, the embryo of immortality transforms—\nOnly then does one know the merit of the nine revolutions.\n\n**Chapter Seven**\nWhere the dragon conceals its pearl,\nWhen the fowl broods its egg—\nWho knows that lead and mercury unite\nJust in time to drink the *daogui*?\n\n**Chapter Eight**\nBathing relies on the water of Kun,\nSighing depends on the wind of Xun.\nThe infant has no cares,\nDwelling alone in the Palace of Grand Tenuity.\n\n**Chapter Nine**\nIn the Purple Court seek the Maiden of Li,\nIn the Vermilion Mound pair the Lad of Kan.\nWhere the Yellow Matron mediates their union,\nThe Supreme Ultimate naturally embraces the Three.\n\n**Chapter Ten**\nThe Qian steed enters the golden chamber,\nThe Kun ox enters the wooden palace.\nWho shall escort the Maiden,\nTo wed her to the Metal Elder?\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\nThe Maiden is just sixteen,\nThe Metal Sinew precisely twenty-seven.\nWithin the bridal chamber, auspicious qi arises,\nTheir joyous union bears the firstborn son.\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nLast night by the western riverbank,\nThe toad’s light shone on the azure sea.\nGathered and brought to the jade chamber,\nWithin the crucible, it refines itself.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nLi and Kan do not copulate,\nQian and Kun transform of themselves.\nIf one can comprehend this principle,\nA single point descends into the Yellow Court.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\nThe Elixir Valley generates divine water,\nThe Yellow Court holds the Great Granary.\nNo longer thoughts of hunger or thirst—\nStraightaway one reaches the immortal realm.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\nThe horse of intent returns to the spirit chamber,\nThe ape of the heart guards the grotto chamber.\nSpirit, essence, soul, and will—\nAll transform into purple-golden frost.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\nOne aperture holds three passes,\nThe three passes are the crossroads.\nSuddenly, with light movement,\nDivine water circulates of itself.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\nTo restrain the *po* is not by the heart’s restraint,\nTo constrain the *hun* is not by the will’s binding.\nOnly retain spirit and qi—\nIn an instant, the mysterious pearl congeals.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen**\nThe oral instructions are few,\nRefining the elixir takes but a moment.\nGently tend the fire,\nAfter ten months, the infant is born.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\nHusband and wife first unite in joy,\nAs years deepen, their intent turns profound.\nWithin the bridal chamber, auspicious qi arises,\nNo day without the spring breeze.\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\nSudden rain on paper butterflies,\nGolden furnace and jade peonies.\nAt the third watch, the red sun blazes,\nIn the sixth month, pristine frost chills.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One**\nFrom the sea’s depths, the complete fire flies,\nFrom the mountain’s brow, the earthly spring stirs.\nIn a moment, their union is complete—\nThe true crucible emits pure smoke.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\nBreak open the aperture of the Mysterious Origin,\nPierce through the barrier of primordial chaos.\nSimply know how to boil water and fire—\nLet dragon and tiger coil as they will.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**\nFire within the water of *Saketa*,\nWaves upon Kunlun’s peak.\nWho can master its application?\nThe great meaning lies with the Yellow Matron.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\nThe medicine is drawn from the primordial qi,\nThe fire seeks the essence of the Great One.\nIf one knows how to gather the medicine and tend the fire,\nThe elixir’s completion is surely seen.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five**\nHow to ingest the original qi?\nTrue essence need not be moved.\nTrue essence and original qi—\nThese are the foundation of the great elixir.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six**\nThe Confucians clarify nature and principle,\nThe Buddhists strike at empty obstinacy.\nUnacquainted with the immortal’s art,\nThe golden elixir’s work is done in an instant.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven**\nMercury in the crescent-moon furnace,\nLead within the cinnabar crucible.\nTortoise and serpent are one true qi—\nTheir offspring is born of the prior heaven.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight**\nSeek the crescent, full, and waning phases,\nWithdraw and add in accord with waxing and waning.\nUnknowing of the true creative transformation,\nWhat then is the true lead?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine**\nQi is the life within form,\nThe heart is the spirit within nature.\nIf one knows the cavity of spirit and qi,\nOne is indeed an immortal attained.\n\n**Chapter Thirty**\nWood marrow simmers in the golden crucible,\nSpring flows into the jade furnace.\nWho will devote three hundred days,\nSlowly applying their effort?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\nThe jade crucible refines lead’s liquid,\nThe golden furnace nurtures mercury’s essence.\nNine returns make nine revolutions,\nGentle nurturing follows the cycle of stars.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two**\nJade liquid nourishes the spirit chamber,\nThe golden embryo binds the qi’s pivot.\nSimply seek the medicine within—\nNo need to consult elixir texts.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\nThe fire jujube is the original kernel,\nThe intermingled pear bears no dregs.\nAll day long, tend the fire—\nDivine water irrigates the golden flower.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\nRefining qi is but wasted effort,\nPreserving spirit is vain labor.\nHow could one know the elixir’s marvel?\nAll day long, it fills the true void.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five**\nTo refine the primordial qi,\nFirst dry the living mercury.\nOnce the sacred embryo is formed,\nThe crown breaks open with thunder’s roar.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six**\nQi’s arising is not tied to the kidneys,\nSpirit’s dwelling is not in the heart.\nQi and spirit are hard to grasp—\nThey transform into a single mass of gold.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven**\nOne aperture is called the Mysterious Female,\nWithin it are stored qi and spirit.\nWho knows this aperture?\nSeek no further for the true.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight**\nThe spleen and stomach are not the spirit chamber,\nThe bladder is but the kidneys’ surplus.\nI urge you: do not cling to these—\nThey are not the ladder to the elixir.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\nA thousand verses on inner visions,\nA goblet of wine from the Central Yellow.\nCarefree, unburdened by things,\nBeyond the body lies the cosmos.\n\n**Chapter Forty**\nCrow and hare boil together,\nTortoise and serpent coil of themselves.\nTransformed into a single grain of elixir,\nGently nurtured into the embryo immortal.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\nAll things born must die,\nThe original spirit dies and revives.\nWhen spirit returns to the qi’s cavity,\nThe Dao of the elixir naturally completes.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two**\nWhere spirit and qi return to their root,\nWhen body and mind revert to their mandate—\nSuch is the true aperture,\nFew indeed know it.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three**\nWithin the body lies the Mysterious Female,\nWithin the heart, no dust or defilement.\nWho can comprehend and recognize it?\nWithin this single aperture, the true is contained.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**\nTrue dragon and tiger of *Li* and *Kan*,\n*Qian* and *Kun* align as horse and ox.\nEach person possesses them in full—\nYet none know to cultivate them.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five**\nHun and po govern the heart,\nSpirit and essence enveloped by intent.\nSteadfastly tend the fire’s timing,\nSilently move the primal line.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six**\nBelow the heart, above the kidneys,\nWest of liver, center-left of lung—\nNeither intestines nor viscera,\nA single *qi* flows freely through.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven**\nThe wondrous work needs no intent,\nThe true mechanism requires no time.\nWho can know this aperture?\nYet do not indulge in non-action.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight**\nSomething exists where nothing seems,\nNon-action merges with action.\nThe power of transformation lies in hand—\nCrow and hare congeal golden fat.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine**\nTiger roars upon the four mountains,\nDragon hums east of the Northern Sea.\nTo seize them, one must wage wild battle,\nEntrusting them to the *Gen* and *Kun* palaces.\n\n**Chapter Fifty**\n*Fu* and *Gou* govern brightness and obscurity,\n*Zhun* and *Meng* hold true dawn and dusk.\nThe elixir crucible congeals white snow—\nNowhere to seek the monkey’s heart.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One**\nBlack mercury, ox-yellow leaves,\nRed lead blooms with purple flowers.\nYet still the fire’s timing must be followed—\nWithin the tripod, cinnabar forms.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two**\nWood’s essence beware the hare,\nMetal’s essence shun the cock.\nWithdraw and replenish during bathing—\nJust as the moon reaches fullness.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three**\nWhen the ten thousand winds first stir,\nA thousand peaks beneath the full moon—\nHasten to issue the true command,\nAnd circulate the *qi* through the *Zhoutian*.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four**\nThe medicine’s ingredients discern old and young,\nThe fire’s timing employs withdrawal and replenishment.\nA single grain of elixir radiates light—\nThe cold toad illuminates the jade eaves.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five**\nThe clam’s belly once split for its pearl,\nThe hen’s nest where eggs are easily found.\nFrom nothing, something arises—\nSpirit and *qi* naturally contend.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six**\nSpirit and *qi* are not mother and child,\nBody and mind are no husband and wife.\nOnly by aligning with Heaven’s mechanism—\nWho knows where the elixir forms?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven**\nWhere the elixir’s head first congeals,\nWhen the medicine has already coagulated—\nDragon and tiger wage mutual battle,\nEven the Eastern Lord knows nothing.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight**\nSide doors and minor methods,\nStrange arts and idle words—\nThe secret of golden liquid and returning elixir\nHas no second path.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine**\nNoble and base, high and low,\nHusband and wife, brothers—\nIf destined to cultivate immortality,\nAll may study the elixir canon.\n\n**Chapter Sixty**\nA broken house is easily repaired,\nA withered medicine is not hard to revive.\nOnly know the method of return and restoration—\nGold and treasure will accumulate like mountains.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One**\nHun and po form the three natures,\nSpirit and essence unite the five phases.\nWithin them, the four images divide—\nGathered and concentrated into the embryo’s essence.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two**\nSteadfastly seek lead and mercury,\nWith a heart of ashes, seek earth and gold.\nOnly then know the true aperture—\nWho grasps its profound depth?\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three**\nCreation has no root or stem,\nYin and yang possess their origin.\nThese true wondrous points—\nNot even father and son transmit them.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Four**\nRetain mercury within the golden tripod,\nGuide lead into the jade pool.\nHost and guest know no left or right—\nOnly recognize the infant.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five**\nThe Yellow Dame’s twin breasts are fair,\nElder Ding’s heart is compassionate.\nThe art of nurturing requires no other technique—\nFrom nothing, the child is reared.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six**\nThe crimson palace soars with a green phoenix,\nThe cinnabar field nurtures the jade toad.\nWithin the gourd, the sky knows no night—\nWhite snow falls in delicate flakes.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven**\nAfter zither and lute harmonize,\nWhen the family legacy is complete—\nNo need to tend the fire’s timing,\nYet beware of harming the infant.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight**\nThe eldest son enters *Dui*,\nThe youngest daughter returns to *Qian*.\nThe *Xun* palace and earth’s position—\nThe locks of the *Zhoutian* seal themselves.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Nine**\nBetween the waxing and waning of the moon,\nAt fullness and emptiness—\nWithdraw and replenish according to punishment and virtue,\nBathe in accord with waxing and waning.\n\n**Chapter Seventy**\nOld mercury, three catties of white,\nTrue lead, a single point of red.\nSeize the marrow of Heaven and Earth—\nTheir union occurs in a fleeting moment.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One**\nWhere the fire’s timing penetrates the mystery,\nWho through the ages would dare transmit it?\nBefore knowing how to gather and refine—\nDo not inquire about the *Zhoutian*.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two**\nClouds scatter from the crabapple moon,\nSpring deepens with willow winds.\nWho can fathom this meaning?\nRaising one’s gaze, one asks the empty void.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Three**\nIn the human realm, no things burden,\nIn the heavens, immortal steps await.\nHaving learned to ride the clouds away,\nTogether they come with white cranes.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Four**\nThe heart’s field bears no weeds or filth,\nThe nature’s ground is free of dust.\nIn the quiet of night beneath the bright moon—\nA single cry of a spring bird.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Five**\nWhite metal refined through the six trigrams,\nBlack tin passes the three barriers.\nAt midnight, in the third watch—\nThe golden crow enters the Guanghan Palace.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Six**\nWhen the elixir ripens, no dragon or tiger remain,\nWhen the fire ends, mercury and lead rest.\nHaving shed the embryo and attained spirit-transformation,\nOne becomes an immortal of the Jade Clarity.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven**\nBlock the path to the Yellow Springs,\nPierce open the east of the Purple Palace.\nHow did Master Haichan—\nTransform into a crane, emerging from *Niquan*?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight**\nWhere do rivers and seas return?\nTo whom do mountains and cliffs belong?\nOnce the golden elixir matures—\nAll become treasures within the house.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine**\nLü received the oral secret from Zhong,\nGe transmitted the heart-seal’s teaching.\nNo idle words at all—\nAll concerns only mercury and lead.\n\n**Chapter Eighty**\nMercury and lead return to a single tripod,\nSun and moon must share the same furnace.\nAdvance the fire with caution—\nTo help you congeal the jade nectar.\n\n**Chapter Eighty-One**\nGathering and union,\nAdvancing the fire and bathing—\nBy the time of shedding the embryo,\nThe nine nines of yang numbers are complete.\n\n**Postface to the \"Returning to the Source\" Chapter**\nThose who refine the golden elixir must know:\nThe winter solstice does not lie in the *zi* hour,\nBathing is not confined to *mao* and *you*.\nMercury and lead are neither saliva, essence, fluids, nor blood.\n\nThe seven returns are returning to the root,\nThe nine restorations are returning to the source.\nMetal’s essence and wood’s liquid—\nWhen they meet earth, they unite.\nDragon and tiger, horse and ox—\nAll are without form.\nAs the former master’s *Wuzhen Pian* states:\n“The essence of the golden elixir lies in the divine water and flowery pond”—\nThese are lead and mercury.\n\nOne who knows the origin of lead knows where mercury is produced;\nKnowing lead and mercury, one knows the divine water and flowery pond.\nKnowing the divine water and flowery pond, one may refine the golden elixir.\nThe work of the golden elixir is accomplished in an instant—\nNot bound by the nine years and three years of rigid schedules,\nNor need one cling to months, days, or hours in practice.\n\nAs Zhongli said: “The four great elements of the body all belong to yin.”\nThus, one cannot seek within the body itself,\nBut must seek that single speck of yang essence within.\nYet this yang essence resides in one aperture,\nBeyond the reach of ordinary minds to fathom.\nThis very aperture is the gate of the mysterious female,\nThe very divine water and flowery pond.\nKnowing this, one may gather and unite,\nThen proceed to refinement and bathing,\nAdvance to embryo separation,\nAnd further nurture the elixir to completion.\n\nHow can one not discern the source of rivers,\nKnow the weight of ingredients,\nOr recognize the proper times?\nSince receiving the teachings of my master,\nI have known this body need not perish,\nAnd this elixir must be achievable.\nNow that the great work is underway,\nI record this for future seekers of immortality.\n\n—Yet another postface by Shi Tai of Apricot Grove",

coil as they will.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**\nFire within the water of *Saketa*,\nWaves upon Kunlun’s peak.\nWho can master its application?\nThe great meaning lies with the Yellow Matron.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\nThe medicine is drawn from the primordial qi,\nThe fire seeks the essence of the Great One.\nIf one knows how to gather the medicine and tend the fire,\nThe elixir’s completion is surely seen.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five**\nHow to ingest the original qi?\nTrue essence need not be moved.\nTrue essence and original qi—\nThese are the foundation of the great elixir.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six**\nThe Confucians clarify nature and principle,\nThe Buddhists strike at empty obstinacy.\nUnacquainted with the immortal’s art,\nThe golden elixir’s work is done in an instant.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven**\nMercury in the crescent-moon furnace,\nLead within the cinnabar crucible.\nTortoise and serpent are one true qi—\nTheir offspring is born of the prior heaven.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight**\nSeek the crescent, full, and waning phases,\nWithdraw and add in accord with waxing and waning.\nUnknowing of the true creative transformation,\nWhat then is the true lead?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine**\nQi is the life within form,\nThe heart is the spirit within nature.\nIf one knows the cavity of spirit and qi,\nOne is indeed an immortal attained.\n\n**Chapter Thirty**\nWood marrow simmers in the golden crucible,\nSpring flows into the jade furnace.\nWho will devote three hundred days,\nSlowly applying their effort?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\nThe jade crucible refines lead’s liquid,\nThe golden furnace nurtures mercury’s essence.\nNine returns make nine revolutions,\nGentle nurturing follows the cycle of stars.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two**\nJade liquid nourishes the spirit chamber,\nThe golden embryo binds the qi’s pivot.\nSimply seek the medicine within—\nNo need to consult elixir texts.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\nThe fire jujube is the original kernel,\nThe intermingled pear bears no dregs.\nAll day long, tend the fire—\nDivine water irrigates the golden flower.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\nRefining qi is but wasted effort,\nPreserving spirit is vain labor.\nHow could one know the elixir’s marvel?\nAll day long, it fills the true void.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five**\nTo refine the primordial qi,\nFirst dry the living mercury.\nOnce the sacred embryo is formed,\nThe crown breaks open with thunder’s roar.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six**\nQi’s arising is not tied to the kidneys,\nSpirit’s dwelling is not in the heart.\nQi and spirit are hard to grasp—\nThey transform into a single mass of gold.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven**\nOne aperture is called the Mysterious Female,\nWithin it are stored qi and spirit.\nWho knows this aperture?\nSeek no further for the true.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight**\nThe spleen and stomach are not the spirit chamber,\nThe bladder is but the kidneys’ surplus.\nI urge you: do not cling to these—\nThey are not the ladder to the elixir.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\nA thousand verses on inner visions,\nA goblet of wine from the Central Yellow.\nCarefree, unburdened by things,\nBeyond the body lies the cosmos.\n\n**Chapter Forty**\nCrow and hare boil together,\nTortoise and serpent coil of themselves.\nTransformed into a single grain of elixir,\nGently nurtured into the embryo immortal.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\nAll things born must die,\nThe original spirit dies and revives.\nWhen spirit returns to the qi’s cavity,\nThe Dao of the elixir naturally completes.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two**\nWhere spirit and qi return to their root,\nWhen body and mind revert to their mandate—\nSuch is the true aperture,\nFew indeed know it.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three**\nWithin the body lies the Mysterious Female,\nWithin the heart, no dust or defilement.\nWho can comprehend and recognize it?\nWithin this single aperture, the true is contained.",

Forty-Six**\nBelow the heart, above the kidneys,\nWest of liver, center-left of lung—\nNeither intestines nor viscera,\nA single *qi* flows freely through.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven**\nThe wondrous

seems,\nNon-action merges with action.\nThe power of transformation lies in hand—\nCrow and hare congeal golden fat.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine**\nTiger roars upon the four mountains,\nDragon hums east of the Northern Sea.\nTo seize them, one must wage wild battle,\nEntrusting them to the *Gen* and *Kun* palaces.\n\n**Chapter Fifty**\n*Fu* and *Gou* govern brightness and obscurity,\n*Zhun* and

nothing, something arises—\nSpirit and *qi* naturally contend.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six**\nSpirit and *qi* are not mother and child,\nBody and mind are no husband and wife.\nOnly by aligning with Heaven’s mechanism—\nWho knows where the elixir forms?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven**\nWhere the elixir’s head first congeals,\nWhen the medicine has already coagulated—\nDragon and tiger wage mutual

cranes.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Four**\nThe heart’s field bears no weeds or filth,\nThe nature’s ground is free of dust.\nIn the quiet of night beneath the bright moon—\nA single cry of a spring bird.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Five**\nWhite metal refined through the six trigrams,\nBlack tin passes the three barriers.\nAt midnight, in the third watch—\nThe golden crow enters the Guanghan Palace.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Six**\nWhen the elixir ripens, no dragon or tiger remain,\nWhen the fire ends, mercury and lead rest.\nHaving shed the embryo and attained spirit-transformation,\nOne becomes an immortal of the Jade Clarity.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven**\nBlock the path to the Yellow Springs,\nPierce open the east of the Purple Palace.\nHow did Master Haichan—\nTransform into a crane, emerging from *Niquan*?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight**\nWhere do rivers and seas return?\nTo whom do mountains and cliffs belong?\nOnce the golden elixir matures—\nAll become treasures within the house.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine**\nLü received the oral secret from Zhong,\nGe transmitted the heart-seal’s teaching.\nNo idle words at all—\nAll concerns only mercury and lead.\n\n**Chapter
