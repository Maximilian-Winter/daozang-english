  "full_translation": "**Jade Explication of the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating the Divine**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Jade Explication of the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating the Divine* (*Dongxuan Lingbao Ziran Jiutian Shengshen Yuzhang Jingjie*).\n**Author:** Daoist Wang Xichao of Mianzhou, Southern Song Dynasty.\n**Volumes:** Three.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Jade Explications Section, Dongxuan Division.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to the Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating the Divine**\n\nForm cannot endure forever; what endures is the *qi* that animates it.\n*Qi* cannot circulate eternally; what ensures its perpetual flow is *jing* as its root.\nWhen these three—form, *qi*, and *jing*—merge as one, the Dao of immortality is not difficult to attain.\n\nThe essentials of the *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating the Divine* are fourfold:\n1. Cherish the form,\n2. Preserve the spirit,\n3. Honor the *qi*,\n4. Secure the root.\n\nThat man possesses form is like a man possessing a house. Though it is a temporary assemblage, how can one allow it to decay and crumble day by day? Thus, there are no people in the world who dwell exposed to the elements.\nMoreover, form is the abode of the hundred spirits, the dwelling of the singular nature, the vessel of clarity and wisdom. The practitioner relies upon it to achieve success, and so must daily cherish the form.\n\nNow, accumulated yang generates spirit, and accumulated yin generates form. Form and spirit cannot be separated even for an instant. When form is sturdy, spirit may linger long; when a house is sturdy, its occupant may dwell long within. If one’s merits remain unfulfilled while the yin-shell withers prematurely, this is ever the affliction of the learner.\nThe foolish, not understanding this, dismiss the outer form as mere husk—eyes and ears perceive it as dust, chaff, or dregs—and thus deem themselves enlightened. Yet when they cast their form into the realm of profit and loss, honor and disgrace, they achieve nothing in their lives. Such people differ from the dead in what way?\nNow, one must not merely cherish the form but ensure that form and spirit work in concert, valuing their union as bone and flesh taking flight together.\n\nOne should not face the wind in summer heat, nor lie upon dampness in summer; sitting too long harms the bones, and labor too long harms the sinews. Extending this principle, in all movement and repose, there is no moment when one should not cherish the form.\nExternally, one should avoid the emaciation of Shan Bao; internally, one should avoid the ailments of Zhang Yi. Beginning with cherishing the form, one ultimately fulfills it—how could this be done carelessly?\n\nWhen form and spirit are as one, never far apart, thus the second essential: preserve the spirit.\nSpirit is the essence of yang, the portion allotted by Heaven. As Zhuangzi said: *\"That which does not depart from essence is called spirit.\"*\nHow does the human spirit descend? It is by mandate that it descends. Thus, in the ninth month, the spirit is arrayed, and the mandate is complete.\nOnce the spirit takes residence, it is like a house with an occupant—beams are raised, doors and windows are carved, seeing and hearing, eating and resting, all proceed from it.\nAt its birth, it startles Heaven and shakes Earth; in its movement, hands grasp and feet walk. Mastering its transformations, whether sitting or standing, perishing or persisting, all serve its purpose.\nYet there are those who employ it their whole lives without understanding it. One day, they suddenly perish, their spirit departing with the rotting corpse like night soil. The spirit does not wait; at midnight, it bears them away. Such people, in the end, know not what spirit is—how lamentable!\nAs the scripture says: *\"Why do the dead make the spirit weep?\"*\n\nSpirit governs *qi*, hence the third essential: honor the *qi*.\nThe vastness of Heaven and Earth is moved by nothing but *qi*; the radiance of the sun and moon is brightened by nothing but *qi*. All people and the myriad things are likewise discerned through it. Where they differ is only in whether the *qi* is upright or not.\nThe tortoise and crane do not wither because they obtain pure *qi*; the pine and cypress do not wither early because they obtain unyielding *qi*. Only man obtains the correct *qi*, yet does not preserve it wholly.\nAs the scripture says: *\"The Three Qi are the honor of Heaven and Earth; the Nine Qi are the root of the myriad things.\"*\nIf man can preserve the root of the Nine Qi and unite above with the honor of the Three Qi, how supremely valuable is this! The affliction lies in not knowing it.\nPeople merely honor *qi* without knowing its origin—is this not shallow?\n*Qi* is originally born of *jing*, and *jing* is stored in the kidneys. Thus, one knows that *qi* takes *jing* as its root. Knowing its root, one may then speak of attaining destiny.\n\nThus, the fourth essential: secure the root.\nAs the scripture says: *\"The teeming myriad things each return to their root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of destiny.\"*\nThe practitioner must guard stillness, and only then will the root deepen and the stem be firm.\nThus, Zhuangzi said: *\"Do not disturb your essence, and you may attain long life.\"*\nWhen form is sustained by spirit, and spirit is made numinous by *qi*, one may return to the origin and refine the elixir. This is to unite in virtue with the Three Origins and align with the Nine Qi.\n\nNow, the *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating the Divine* is a forbidden text of the August Highest Heaven, transmitted not by the turning of kalpas but by no cause at all. It aims to overturn the prevailing customs of inversion and guide people toward the realm of benevolence and longevity, awakening those who have not yet understood.\nAbove, it expounds the Three Treasures, enlightening Heaven, Earth, man, and the myriad things, all of which receive nurturance.\nNext, it unfolds the Nine Chapters, establishing the Nine Heavens.\nMan receives the Nine Qi as the origin of life; the head mirrors the Nine Heavens, the upper regions array the Nine Palaces, the body conceals the Nine Treasuries to emulate the Nine Provinces, and the outer openings correspond to the Nine Fields. In the functioning of the body, how could it be apart from the Nine Qi?\nThose who fully employ them ascend to the Nine Heavens; those who employ them secondarily attain liberation through the corpse; those who do not know their use merely receive a single form, wandering as if borrowing *qi*.\nThis Dao is possessed by all, yet why can they not attain it? Because private desires prevail and worldly affairs distract.\nIn the era of the Three Sovereigns, the people were simple and affairs were few. The Great Dao was not concealed, and all knew the essentials of cultivating the body. Thus, there were those who, weary of the world at twelve hundred years, ascended on high.\nAs the scripture says: *\"In high antiquity, there were perfected ones who grasped Heaven and Earth, held yin and yang, breathed essence and *qi*, stood alone and preserved spirit, their flesh and muscles as one. Thus, they could live as long as Heaven and Earth, without end.\"*\n\nSince the calamity of the Qin fires, the books of the Three Sovereigns have been lost to the world, leaving only the *Classic of Difficulties* and the *Basic Questions* as the study of physicians. Thus, the preface to these texts states: \"The books of the Three Sovereigns spoke of the Great Dao, but in later ages, they were utterly lost.\" Though the methods of cultivating the body and nurturing life have persisted like a thread unbroken, Buddhism later spread into China, teaching joy in extinction and stillness. Yet by severing the arm to point the way, it strayed ever further from the root, and the learning of our Great Dao grew ever more obscure.\n\nRecently, upon returning to the southeast, I spoke with a worthy man of my hometown, Master Ren, who said: \"The *Scripture of the Divine Chapters on the Generation of Spirit* is truly the great origin of Daoist teachings, yet many merely skim its surface. Though Jade Toad Master once provided annotations, his words were concise and essential, leaving scholars struggling to grasp their depth. If one were to expound upon it in detail, making it accessible to all, it would not be without benefit.\" His words resonated with me, and in the intervals of my devotions, I resolved to apply what I have learned.\n\nIn former times, Master Ouyang Wenzhong held no fondness for Daoist learning throughout his life, yet in his later years, while governing Bozhou, he began to perceive its truths. One day, he sought instruction from the hermit of Stone Pond, expressing his desire to study. The hermit replied: \"Your house is already in ruins; it is difficult to speak of such matters again. If you can merely clarify what lies before you, it may yet suffice.\" Master Ouyang’s virtue, writings, and renown stood peerless in his age—how could he lack the capacity to receive the Dao? Yet even he was said to have lost the morning light, barely attaining clarity of the present. How much more so for those whose capacity falls short of his? Those who attain this Dao ascend nine generations of ancestors to transcendence—what concern is there for the present? To stubbornly invite hardship or to yield and invite constraint—can one not strive?\n\nWritten on the first day of the fifth month in the first year of the Kaixi reign of the Great Song, by Wang Xichao Yinxian, Daoist of Chongxu Abbey in Mianzhou.\n\n*Explication of the* Scripture of the Divine Chapters on the Natural Generation of Spirit from the Nine Heavens of the Cavernous Mystery of Numinous Treasure, *Volume One*\n*Explicated by Wang Xichao Yinxian, Daoist of Chongxu Abbey in Mianzhou*\n\nThe Heavenly Treasure Lord is the venerable deity of the Great Cavern, and the Heavenly Treasure Elder is the ancestral *qi* of the Heavenly Treasure Lord. The Elder is the *qi* of the Primal Chaos of the Supreme Jade Void, comprising ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety thousand *qi*. In the first year of the Dragon Han era, this *qi* transformed and gave birth to the Heavenly Treasure Lord, who, when revealing the scriptures, was titled the Supreme Lord of the Great Possession of the Jade Clarity Palace.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; kalpas are the greatest of times. Where there is form, there is number; where there is time, there is change. When numbers are exhausted and times transform, all converges in dissolution—only the Three Clarities’ Most Sagely Ones and the Nine Heavens’ True Kings are unbound by form or constrained by number. Thus, they endure through kalpa after kalpa, ageless beyond the posterior heavens.\n\nThe Heavenly Treasure Lord is the ancestor of the myriad Dao, known as the Venerable Deity of the Great Cavern. Thus, among the Three Caverns of the teachings, there is the method of the Great Cavern, which expounds the Dao of revolving winds and primordial fusion—a path not for the comprehension of lesser immortals. Within the human body, he is the Supreme One Emperor Lord.\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of the Great Cavern of Supreme Clarity*: \"Above, it binds the Three Origins; below, it binds the myriad things. In stillness, it is the body; in movement, it is the spirit.\" The Elder is also called the Father of Fathers. The Three Origins are: first, the Primal Chaos of the Supreme Non-Being; second, the Crimson Chaos of the Supreme Non-Being; and third, the Dark and Tranquil Mystery-Pervading Origin.\n\nThe *Scripture of Orthodox Unity* states: \"The Supreme Non-Being transforms, and the Three *Qi* become manifest.\" The Supreme Non-Being is the unbegun beginning; the Three Origins are the root of creation’s inception. Rooted in non-being and begun in origin, the Three *Qi* are thus generated. The name \"Origin Beginning\" is derived from this. Therefore, the Three Origins give rise to the Three *Qi*, and the Three *Qi* are the natural *qi* of the Great Void. The Void is born of the Profound; the Profound is born of the Origin; the Origin is born of the Beginning. Thus, the *Scripture of the Opening of Heaven* says: \"When the primordial *qi* moved, Heaven and Earth were established.\"\n\nThough the Three *Qi* are generated, they have not yet been delimited, and so are called the Primal Chaos. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: \"The Crimson Writ of Primal Chaos, the Non-Ultimate True Ones, the Enlightened Ancestral Kalpa, who transform and give birth to the various heavens.\" The Three *Qi* of the Three Origins’ palaces are the original essences of water and fire, corresponding below to the human body’s heart palace and the two kidneys. In Heaven, they govern the Northern Dipper and the talismanic covenants of numinous writ. If one cultivates the Dao and preserves authenticity, with merit and virtue complete, these Three Spirits ascend together with oneself—this is the Dao of primordial fusion.\n\nThe Three Spirits are Generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou. In the Zhihe era, Emperor Renzong fell ill and remained unconscious for three days. When he briefly recovered, he recounted dreaming of wandering through thorns, lost and bewildered, when a divine figure in golden armor addressed him: \"Heaven, seeing Your Majesty’s transformative heart, grants you twelve more years of life.\" The Emperor asked, \"How shall I return?\" The divine figure replied, \"I shall send you with my chariot.\"\n\nThe Emperor mounted the chariot and asked the divine figure’s name. The reply came: \"I am the one called General Ge.\" Upon awakening, the Emperor ordered a search of the *Daoist Canon*, where indeed General Ge was found—overseer of the Heavenly Gate. His rank was elevated, and a temple was established for him in the capital. Yet at that time, no one memorialized the throne to recognize him as the spirit dwelling within the body.\n\nThe qi of Jade Clarity is fundamentally one. Thus, the three titles are identical in essence. Within the Canon, there are designations such as Jade Clarity and Jade Emperor—these are honorifics. \"Jade\" signifies virtue, while \"Emperor\" denotes Heaven. The first kalpa of the Dragon-Han era marks the primordial kalpa. \"Dragon\" embodies transformation, and \"Han\" signifies vastness. Before Heaven and Earth took form, a single qi spiraled through the Great Void, its body coiling and undulating, its transformations boundless, weaving spirit and refining essence. The Heavenly Perfected One witnessed the kalpa’s inception and named it Dragon-Han. Hence, the *Scripture of Divine Transformations* records that the Three Sovereigns all bore dragon bodies and human heads. At the kalpa’s dawn stood the Dragon Ancestor Great Emperor, and there was also the Star of the Dragon Ancestor. Among the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Dragon-Transformation Brahma-Passage Heavenly Emperor shares this meaning.\n\nThe Numinous Treasure Lord is the revered deity of the Cavern of Mystery, while the Numinous Treasure Venerable One is the ancestral qi of the Numinous Treasure Lord. The Venerable One is the qi of Crimson Chaos, Supreme Non-Being, and Primordial Purple Clarity—comprising ninety-nine quadrillion, nine hundred ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, ninety-nine million qi. Later, at the Dragon-Han kalpa’s unfolding, the Numinous Treasure Lord was transformed into being. After one kalpa, in the first year of the Crimson Brightness era, he revealed scriptures to deliver humanity, assuming the title of Supreme Clarity, Mystic Capital, Jade Metropolis, Seven Treasures, and Purple Tenuity Palace.\n\nJade Clarity is the Heavenly Treasure Lord, Supreme Clarity the Numinous Treasure Lord, and Grand Clarity the Divine Treasure Lord. From this, we know the titles of the Three Treasures: the Heavenly Treasure Lord should be called the revered deity of the Cavern of Perfection. Yet today, he is solely referred to as the revered deity of the Great Cavern, not as the Cavern of Perfection—why? Before the Three Caverns were distinguished, they were collectively named the Great Cavern, just as the Two Modes were undivided and called the Supreme Ultimate. The Great Cavern fundamentally embodies the Dao of revolving wind and primordial fusion—this fusion is the state before the Three Caverns were separated. The Primordial Beginning Dharma King is the sovereign of creation, and the precelestial sages are so named. The Cavern of Perfection emerged only after the Three Caverns were distinguished, and the Primordial Beginning also bears this title. In the present scripture’s intent, \"Great Cavern\" refers to the origin, while \"Numinous Treasure Lord\" refers to the manifestation. According to the *Preface to the Canon’s Various Chapters*: \"The Cavern of Mystery is the origin, while Numinous Treasure is the manifestation\"—this speaks of the manifestation.\n\nThe qi of the Great Cavern originally arose from the Void, flowing into the Cavern of Perfection, then into the Cavern of Mystery. The teachings of the Cavern of Mystery are specifically named Numinous Treasure—they are the foundation of the defined teachings. The so-called \"manifestation\" refers to scriptures. In the first year of the Dragon-Han kalpa, there were no scriptures; only at the kalpa’s unfolding did writing first appear. The *Origins of Daoist Teachings* states: \"Daoist teachings began with the Three Origins, descending from origin to manifestation before unfolding into scriptures and instructions.\" Now, the Numinous Treasure Lord was born at the dawn of the Dragon-Han kalpa’s unfolding and fully revealed scriptures at the beginning of humanity’s deliverance. Observing his title and era, we know he is the progenitor of the teachings. He is also titled the Primordial Capital, Jade Metropolis, Seven Treasures, and Purple Tenuity Palace—the repository of the Canon.\n\nYet the supreme qi of Jade Clarity culminates at ninety-nine quadrillion, nine hundred ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion qi. Upon reaching the qi of Crimson Chaos and Supreme Non-Being, it already lacks billions of qi. Thus, we know the kalpic cycles and qi allotments differ, no longer as they once were—this is humanity’s self-invited consequence. In high antiquity, there were those who lived for millions of years; even in the Tang and Yu eras, lifespans exceeded a hundred. Today, people barely reach seventy—how can the present differ so from the past? All receive the same qi, so why the disparity? The cycles of life and death proceed: birth is followed by extinction, extinction by rebirth. Wisdom and perception gradually dim, and qi is depleted. The present falls short of the past, and the future will fall short of the present. Like a measure of water poured repeatedly into different vessels, each transfer loses droplets until it no longer fills the measure. As days and months pass, its drying is inevitable. Thus, the cycles of life and death turn like a wheel, never pausing—deeply lamentable.\n\nThe Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, taking life and death as their duty, braved prohibitions to earnestly petition, enabling people to know the root of generating spirit, escape the turning wheel, and ultimately return to the immortal Dao. Their intent is truly profound. Having attained human form, one must not recklessly traverse life and death. Instead, one should reflect inward and reverse the light to avoid losing oneself to other realms—only then may one still hope for the immortal Dao.\n\nThe Divine Treasure Lord is the revered deity of the Cavern of Spirits, while the Divine Treasure Venerable One is the ancestral qi of the Divine Treasure Lord. The Venerable One is the qi of Dark Stillness, Mystic Penetration, Primordial Non-Being, and Supreme Clarity—comprising ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million qi. Later, in the first year of the Crimson Brightness era, the Divine Treasure Lord was transformed into being. After two kalpas, in the first year of the Supreme Sovereign era, he revealed scriptures, assuming the title of the Three Sovereigns, Cavern of Spirits, Grand Clarity, and Supreme Ultimate Palace.\n\nMaster Jade Toad Zhao posited that Jade Clarity corresponds to the Metal Palace, Supreme Clarity to the Fire Palace, and Grand Clarity to the Earth Palace—but omitted Wood and Water. Scholars have long doubted this theory without seeking its underlying principle. Yet among the Five Phases, Metal is primary. Metal itself is without qi, but it nurtures qi in the Thunder (Zhen) direction—Wood. Metal also restrains Wood, embodying the principle of husband and wife, and generates Water, embodying the bond of mother and child. Of the Five Substances, only Metal remains uncorrupted: it does not scorch in fire, does not moisten in water, does not harm in earth, and does not damage in wood. When the perfected comprehend this to refine the elixir, they seek correspondences among Metal, Fire, and Earth—while Water and Wood naturally align without contrivance. An ancient immortal poem states: \"The Five Phases are complete in Earth; the Four Images do not depart from Metal.\"\n\nThe ancestral qi of the Three Treasure Lords originates from the Three Origins. Now, examining the scriptural texts, the \"Dark Stillness and Mystic Penetration\" passage omits the character *lou* (leak)—this is not unique to the Shu edition but appears everywhere.\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Chapters on the Generation of Spirits* underwent collation by the imperial minister Wang Qinruo of our present dynasty, yet even so, such errors persist—how much more so for the various scriptures? Moreover, *Taiyi’s Trial Vision* is mistakenly rendered as *Taiyi’s Precept Vision*, and similar instances abound.\n\nThe *qi* of *Hundun Supreme Non-Being, Primordial Highest Jade Void* is written as the *qi* of *Red Chaos Supreme Non-Being, Non-Supreme Purple Void*. Since the preceding line speaks of the *qi* of *Highest Jade Void*, the phrase *Red Chaos Supreme Non-Being* likely omits a character, and should read simply *Supreme Jade Void qi*. The Heavenly Treasure Lord is titled *Highest*, so the Numinous Treasure Lord ought to be titled *Primordial Supreme*, without the two characters *Non-Supreme*. Yet in *Dark Stillness and Mystic Penetration*, the character *yuan* (primordial) is again omitted, rendering it simply *Non-Supreme Jade Void qi*.\n\nUpon recent collation, it appears that in the *Daoist Canon*, the characters *wu* (non-) and *yuan* (primordial) share similar strokes. It is feared that during early transmission, scribal errors arose from overlapping characters, leading to their omission—or else they were simply left out. How could the *qi* of the Three Origins possess only two origins? Such reasoning is untenable. The character *yuan* should be added beneath *Dark Stillness and Mystic Penetration*, while the phrase *Supreme Jade Void qi* awaits correction by those of discernment. This follows the *Spring and Autumn* principle of transmitting doubts as doubts.\n\nThe Three Origins are expounded in the *Scripture of the Origins of the Three Caverns*. Since entering the Dao, I have often lamented the excessive laxity in teaching lineages, where learning lacks proper masters and errors abound. Even among those who claim understanding, some arrogantly inflate themselves—what is this if not carving and painting the plainest of women?\n\nMoreover, observing the texts circulated in recent generations for fasts and Offerings, one finds frequent inversions of black and white, and the fabrication of non-existent things. Those of insight will perceive this for themselves.\n\nThough these three titles differ across eras, their essence remains one. They divide into the Three *qi* of Mysterious, Primordial, and Origin—governing the Three Treasures—and all are revered spirits of the Three *qi*, titled *Generators of the Three qi*. The Three Titles together generate the Nine *qi*. The Nine *qi* emerge prior to the Great Void, concealed within the Hollow Cavern. Without light, without image; without form, without name; without color, without trace; without sound, without voice.\n\nYi’s craft within the bow’s reach could not prevent self-praise; the Dao, descending to become *qi*, could not prevent the bestowal of names and titles. From One dividing into Three, from Three merging into Nine—though the Three Titles differ, their root is one, converging in unity. When one grasps at them yet cannot hold them, is this not that which is beyond form? When one names and recites them, is this not that which is beneath form?\n\nThe Three Titles are as follows: the Heavenly Treasure Lord, titled *Highest Great Possession, Jade Clarity Palace*; the Numinous Treasure Lord, titled *Supreme Clarity, Jade Capital of the Seven Treasures, Purple Tenuity Palace*; and the Spirit Treasure Lord, titled *Three Sovereigns, Cavern Spirit, Supreme Clarity, Great Ultimate Palace*. The Great Ultimate Palace is one of the Nine Palaces, where immortals who attain the Dao reside. Within its halls, the ranks of Perfected, Great Masters, Dukes, and Ministers each hold their proper place. Though the Three Titles differ, their origin is the single body of the Primordial Beginning.\n\nAt the inception of the Primordial Beginning, before Heaven and Earth existed, the One Body generated the Ten Thousand Beings—hence the title *Great Possession, Jade Clarity Palace*. When the Dragon Han unveiled the Chart and Heaven and Earth first divided, the Numinous Treasure was born within the Western Heaven’s Yuchai Mountain. At that time, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King sat upon Jade Capital Mountain, inhaling celestial *qi* above and drinking earthly springs below. The palaces and halls of Jade Capital Mountain were adorned with the Seven Treasures and gold and jade, with the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace at their center. After the Numinous Treasure Lord’s birth, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King commanded him to preside—hence this title.\n\nDuring the Red Clarity era, at the time of the Three Sovereigns’ division and transformation, the Spirit Treasure Lord was born. This coincided with the descent of the Cavern Spirit—hence the title *Three Sovereigns, Cavern Spirit, Supreme Clarity, Great Ultimate Palace*.\n\nThe Three *qi*—Mysterious, Primordial, and Origin—are as follows: the *Non-Born Mysterious qi*, accumulating purity to form azure; the *Cavern-Generated Primordial qi*, accumulating emptiness to form white; and the *Void-Generated Origin qi*, accumulating light to form yellow. Once the Three *qi* are complete, they merge to generate the Nine *qi*. The Nine *qi* are the single *qi* of Yellow Evolution—these are the Nine *qi*. The Three *qi* all originate from the Three Voids: *Supreme Non-Being* pertains to Jade Clarity, *Great Void* pertains to Supreme Clarity, and *Hollow Cavern* pertains to Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe One *qi* born of *Supreme Non-Being* is called *Great Inception*; emerging prior to the *Great Void*, it is called *Great Beginning*; concealed within the *Hollow Cavern*, it is called *Great Simplicity*. Formerly, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King and the Nine Heavens’ Perfected Kings were born prior to the Nine *qi*. At that time, there were no years or months; each interval of *qi* spanned ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-one thousand *li*, constituting one year.\n\nWhen it emerged prior to the *Great Void* and concealed itself within the *Hollow Cavern*, one could not see its beginning when approaching, nor its end when following. Without light, image, form, name, color, trace, sound, or voice—who could comprehend it? Thus it is said: the Dao’s law is self-so.\n\nThe Dao governs and steers the world, opening and penetrating the Mysterious. The Three Colors intermingled in chaos, now present, now absent. As the revolving numbers reached their limit, the Three *qi* radiated light. *Qi* purified and ascended, accumulating yang to form Heaven; *qi* congealed and settled, accumulating stagnation to form Earth. The Nine *qi* arrayed in order, giving rise to the sun, moon, and stars. Yin and yang, the Five Phases, the people, and the myriad beings all received life and completion.\n\nDoes Heaven revolve? Who presides over it? It must rely on *qi* to revolve. At the moment of Heaven and Earth’s initial separation, the Spirit Treasure Lord governed with the *qi* of *Dark Stillness and Mystic Penetration*, opening and cleaving them. The closing of the gate is called *Kun*; the opening of the gate is called *Qian*. When closed, the Ten Thousand Beings are first enveloped; when opened, the Ten Thousand Beings are first born. This is the Three generating the Ten Thousand Beings.\n\nOnce chaos divided, the Three *qi*—azure, yellow, and white—began to emerge, now present, now absent, without visible form. To say they exist is not truly existence; to say they do not exist is not truly non-existence. Who moves them? When the revolving numbers reach their limit, they stir. Who opens and closes them? When the numbers reach their extremity, they part. Heaven and Earth await this to be established; the sun and moon await this to shine. Thus the Nine *qi* array in order: arrayed, they are orderly and unconfused; aligned, they do not transgress their bounds. Yin and yang, the Five Phases interweave to form sequence; the people and the myriad beings all receive life. What greater achievement is there than this in the work of creation?\n\nHeaven and Earth with their myriad transformations cannot generate life without being nurtured by the Three Origins or guided by the Nine *qi*. The Three *qi* are the honor of Heaven and Earth; the Nine *qi* are the root of the Ten Thousand Beings. Thus, the Three unite to form virtue, the ultimate of Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Qi* arriving at the body is called life; *qi* departing from the body is called death. All things—whether bearing teeth and hair or the tiniest creeping insects—share this without exception. Without nurture from the Three Origins or guidance from the Nine *qi*, none can come to life.\n\nOf all beings, humans are the most numinous, standing as one of the Three Powers among the Ten Thousand Beings—truly exalted. As *Zhuangzi* says, \"Heaven and Earth are born together with me.\" Though all receive life in the same way, once endowed, their actions diverge without bound. Why then is the longevity of Heaven and Earth so vast, while human life is so fleeting? It is because they do not comprehend the principle of the Three uniting to form virtue, the ultimate of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThis \"ultimate\" is the Center. As the *Zuo Tradition of the Spring and Autumn Annals* states, \"Humans receive the Center to establish their destiny.\" The *Book of Documents* says, \"The Supreme Lord bestows the *zhong* upon the people below\"—this is the Yellow Court of Daoist teachings. \"Yellow\" is the color of Earth; \"Court\" is the Center of the Four Directions.\n\nHeaven’s One generates Water, which in humans becomes essence, stored in the kidneys. The kidneys have left, right, and a central channel. The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: \"On the left is Lesser Yang, on the right Greater Yin; behind is the Secret Gate, before is the Gate of Life.\" Since the kidneys are the gate of life and death, the work of nurturing must begin with the Yellow Court.\n\nWithin the kidneys, essence is stored; from essence, *qi* is born. When *qi* and the heart unite, heart-fluid and *qi* intermingle, refined in the Yellow Court. If one knows how to unite them without error, then essence merges with *qi*, *qi* with spirit, and spirit with the Dao. Thus the principle of ceaseless generation does not lose the Center of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the Three unite to form virtue, the ultimate of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen humans receive life in the womb, the Three Origins nurture them, and the Nine *qi* shape their form. After nine months, the spirits are arrayed, *qi* fills the body, and sound is produced. The voice is still joined to the spirit, and the Nine Heavens rejoice. The Great One holds the talisman; the Thearch assigns rank; the Registrar inscribes the record; the Director of Destinies fixes the allotted years; the Five Thearchs oversee birth; the Holy Mother guards the chamber; celestial and terrestrial spirits, along with the Three Realms, all stand guard.\n\nThe Marshal of the Nine Heavens stands in the courtyard, facing east, reciting the *Precious Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Birth of the Spirits* nine times. If the child is male, the myriad spirits chant \"Reverence\"; if female, they chant \"Obedience.\" If male, the Director of Destinies responds with respect; if female, with compliance. Only then is the child born. If the Marshal of the Nine Heavens does not issue the command, and the myriad spirits do not chant their responses, birth does not occur.\n\nAccording to the *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir*: Humans receive life from the celestial soul, congeal through the primordial spirit, revolve through the Nine *qi*, and are endowed with destiny by the Great One. The Three Paths open, and spirit accumulates in the Dark Palace. Thus, the mysterious fluid coils sevenfold, flowing with moisture and spreading its grace. The sun and moon illuminate the Six Voids; the mouth and eyes move the spirit-vessels. Clouds drift and rain falls—virtue rivals Heaven and Earth. Within the womb, the Five Causes come together.\n\nThe Way of establishing humans is thus of such weight. The Five Causes are the Five Spirits; the Three Paths are the Three Perfected. The Five Spirits are the soul of Heaven; the Three Perfected are the Dao of Heaven; the Nine *qi* are the embryo of Heaven; the Great One is the source of Heaven; the sun and moon are the eyes of Heaven; the mysterious fluid is the moisture of Heaven; the Six Voids are the light of Heaven; the Dark Palace is the treasury of Heaven; spirit and *qi* are the transformations of Heaven; the primordial spirit is the mutation of the Thearch.\n\nIt is also said: The Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother— the Primordial Father governs *qi*, regulating the Thearch’s governance; the Mysterious Mother governs essence, transforming and congealing the womb. The Great One blends them together; the Five Spirits bear the register; talismans are arrayed for the Five Spirits, each with its own charge.\n\nThus, the Three Offices guard the Perfected; the hundred joints receive the numinous. The Thearch fixes the register, and the destined life stands firm. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders raise the body and usher in the dawn.\n\nUpon close examination, the meaning of this passage aligns closely with the *Birth of the Spirits Chapters*. What is called \"receiving life in the womb, nurtured by the Three Origins, shaped by the Nine *qi*\" is the Mysterious Mother generating essence, transforming and congealing the womb, revolving the Nine *qi*, and the Three Paths of spirit. \"After nine months, the spirits are arrayed, *qi* fills the body, and sound is produced\" corresponds to \"the sun and moon illuminating the Six Voids, the mouth and eyes moving the spirit-vessels.\" \"The Nine Heavens rejoice, the Great One holds the talisman, the Thearch assigns rank, the Registrar inscribes the record, the Director of Destinies fixes the allotted years, the Five Thearchs oversee birth\" through to \"birth does not occur\" corresponds to \"the Great One blending them together, the Five Spirits bearing the talismans, the Thearch fixing the register, the destined life standing firm, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders raising the body and ushering in the dawn.\"\n\nAccording to the *Mirror of the Mysterious*: The Great One is the great master of long life. In the teachings, there are the Great One Thearch, the Great One Perfected Lord, the Great One Primordial Lord, the Great One Perfected Person, and the Great One Venerable Spirit. This Great One is not an external deity but the Great One of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern. His form resembles a newly born male, unclothed, four inches in height—the spirit of the Great Cavern’s returned womb, the first form. His name is *Wuyoushou*, and he constantly guards beneath the human jade pillow. At the moment of human birth, he holds the talisman and blends the myriad spirits.\n\nThe Thearch is also called the Seven Numinous Ones or the Spirit Elder. He constantly guards above the human brows, determining the rank of destiny. The Director of Destinies is the Central Elder, guarding the human heart and fixing the allotted years. The Five Thearchs are: the Azure Thearch at the Eastern Ridge, the Vermilion Thearch at the Long Awakening, the White Thearch at Peng’s Peace, the Black Thearch at Preserving Completion, and the Yellow Thearch at Containing Radiance—they oversee human birth. The Holy Mother is the Holy Mother of the Nine Heavens. Since solitary yang does not generate and solitary yin does not complete, the Holy Mother is the master of utmost yin, delighting in bringing life to completion. She guards the chamber, warding off misfortune.\n\nThe Master of Ceremonies who stands in the courtyard facing east to recite the *Chapter of Generating Spirits* is none other than the Grand Master of Longevity, the Great Marshal. His surname is Bocheng, his given name Xusheng, and he is a Perfected One of the Highest Clarity. When men respectfully assent and chant with reverence, and women respectfully comply and chant with devotion, distinctions of noble and base are thereby made—much like the difference between jade scepters and clay tiles in poetry.\n\nAll the spirits mentioned above are the gods of one’s own body. When the moment is right and the qi is full, the hundred spirits assemble together. Now, the spirits regard qi as their mother, and the spirits are the children of qi. If the spirits can abide in qi, and qi can retain the form, then longevity and enduring vision present no difficulty. Alas, people do not understand this, extinguishing their lives through desire and trivializing existence through profit—how deeply lamentable!\n\nWhen a person is reborn into the human realm, washing their form in the Great Yang, it shakes heaven and earth, a dignity too great to surpass. The celestial perfected, earthly spirits, and the Three Realms all descend together—such is not taken lightly. At the time of birth, it is not to be deemed mean. Therefore, one who can cherish their form, preserve their spirit, honor their qi, and secure their root will never perish or decay but attain transcendence, their bones and flesh ascending together to the Three Clarities. This is to unite virtue with the Three Qi and align with the Nine Qi.\n\nYet people, having obtained life, fail to revere their qi, honor their form, preserve their life, or cherish their spirit, bringing about their own decay and separation from their original truth. The *Mystic Origin’s Veiled Charge* states: “Born between heaven and earth, humans receive the harmony of the Two Qi, crown the myriad creatures, dwell in the most numinous place, and gather the essence of the Five Phases. They partake in the Three Powers, standing alongside heaven and earth—truly the most noble without peer. If one attains a human body, one should cherish and protect it, for the boundary between life and death is fraught with delusion. The human body is like standing on a plank while a ball rolls beneath; attaining a human body is like boarding a boat against the current. This is why the Divine King, in his earnest concern, pities sentient beings for their unawareness, their disregard for life, and their submission to death. They do not value the human body and thus raise this question.\n\nOnce a human body is attained, it must proceed to the Southern Cinnabar Fire-Refining Pool, where it is cleansed with the Yellow Flower’s waters before entering the womb to become a person. Now, this scripture speaks of washing the form in the Great Yang rather than the Yellow Flower—why? The Yellow Flower is the essence of yang, the upper abode of the sun, also called the Cavern Yang Palace. Within it lies the Flowing Fire Pool, containing the Yellow Flower’s waters. Divine beings constantly bathe their forms in these waters, which is why our teachings, when recommending the deceased, employ the *Longevity Talisman*, pointing to this.\n\nSince becoming human involves so many stages, it is truly what shakes heaven and earth, with the Three Realms descending together—hardly a mean affair. Each time I recite this passage, I close the scroll and sigh deeply. This body stands alongside heaven and earth, its qi communicating with yin and yang. This body is the body of the Three Treasures, this qi the qi of yin and yang. Nothing is more venerable than the Three Treasures, no spirit greater than yin and yang. When their mechanism is set in motion, the myriad things transform accordingly—so how could it not shake heaven and earth, with the Three Realms descending together? Such is no exaggeration.\n\nHaving attained this life, one cannot but rejoice—how could it be taken lightly? Yet people do not cherish their form, preserve their spirit, honor their qi, or secure their root to unite virtue with the Three Qi and align with the Nine Qi. This is entirely because selfish desires prevail while wisdom is lacking. How many are like those who would use Marquis Sui’s pearl to shoot a sparrow a thousand fathoms high? Such people are everywhere—how could they not lose their original truth?\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Chapter of Generating Spirits* is the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, where three coalesce to form sound and congeal into numinous script. It blends the hundred spirits and conceals their inner names, generating qi to structure form—this is the *Chapter of Spontaneity*. The vastness of heaven and earth cannot move without qi; the human body cannot stand without qi; the Three Caverns’ sacred scriptures cannot take form without qi. That it is called the *Chapter of Spontaneity* means it does not originate from human speech.\n\nAccording to the *Twelve Disciplines of the Great Perfected*, the spontaneous original text is primary, being the teaching of prior heaven. The Nine Heavens’ Elder told the Three Heavens’ Jade Lads: “The *Record in the Cinnabar Womb’s Essence* states that at the inception of generating mystery, the qi of the Great Void’s spontaneity congealed to form sacred script—this is the present *Chapter of Generating Spirits*.” The Flying Mystery refers to the fact that among the Three Qi, the mysterious qi is ultimate. Its qi is like clouds, drifting and circling in the Great Void, coalescing only after threefold union to produce sound.\n\nThis threefold union, as the *Scripture of Origins* states: “The human form is one, the body is two, and qi is three. Only when form, body, spirit, and qi are complete does a person come into being.” Alternatively, spirit is one, qi is two, and essence is three—only then is a spirit formed. Or heaven is one, earth is two, and humanity is three—only then are the Dao and virtue of heaven and earth complete. Thus it is said that three coalesce to form sound. “Sound” refers to harmonious tones, as in this very chapter.\n\nScripture is congealed by qi, spirits are united by qi, and like attracts like—hence it is said to blend the hundred spirits. Moreover, in the Upper Prime Palace of the Purple Tenuity, there is a talisman for extending life. When placed in the eight directions, the qi of the eight directions responds in an instant, and all become human. When the talisman is concealed again, they revert to qi. Blending returns all to one body, which is why the *Scripture of Salvation* states: “The Perfected blend without division, and the celestial qi returns to one body.” All is the spontaneous qi.\n\nReciting the *Celestial Treasure* opens the light of heaven and earth. Reciting the *Numinous Treasure* opens the souls of the Nine Darks’ long night. Reciting the *Spirit Treasure* governs the myriad spirits. Reciting the *Great One* equips the body’s spirits. Reciting the *Thearch* structures the form. Reciting the *Nine Heavens* generates humanity. Reciting as a scholar ascends to heaven. The Dao is not distant from humanity—it is humanity that distances itself from the Dao. When heaven and humanity unite, there is originally no separation.\n\nPursuing this by principle, the Celestial Treasure is the Primordial Beginning, the Numinous Treasure is the Lord of the Dao, and the Spirit Treasure is the Venerable Lord. The Celestial Treasure arose at the dawn of Dragon Han, when heaven and earth first divided—above, no further hue; below, no further abyss—only the vast expanse of primordial chaos, boundless and lightless. The Lord of the Celestial Treasure, by the spontaneous generation of the Jade Chapters of Divine Manifestation, opened and ordered it, so that above and below took their places. Thus the *Scripture of Salvation through the Crossing of All* states: “Where there is no script, there is no illumination.”\n\nThe Lord of the Numinous Treasure arose at the inception of the Dragon Han’s unfolding chart, becoming the first to deliver humanity. Hence it is said to open the souls of the Nine Darks’ long night. The *Scripture of Salvation through the Crossing of All* states: “Where there is no script, there is no deliverance.”\n\nThe Lord of the Spirit Treasure arose in the first year of Vermilion Brightness, when the myriad patterns were already arrayed, the Great Void nurtured the wondrous, and the great image radiated numinosity. From the qi of yang essence were transformed the lofty perfected and exalted immortals; from the qi of tranquil emptiness were transformed the Primordial Lords and Holy Mothers; from the qi of unyielding vigor were transformed the Heavenly Soldiers and Mighty Warriors; and from the remaining qi were nurtured the myriad spirits. Thus it is said to govern the myriad spirits. The *Scripture of Salvation through the Crossing of All* states: “The five scripts unfold the expanse, universally engendering divine spirits.” To govern is to ensure they wield no reckless power.\n\nSpeaking of the body: the qi of the Lord of the Celestial Treasure resides in the Mud-Pill Palace, its spirit issuing from the eyes as light. Thus it is said to open the light of heaven and earth. The qi of the Lord of the Numinous Treasure resides in the Crimson Palace, which is the numinous repository born of blood. Blood is yin, stored in the liver, and the liver governs the hun-soul. Thus it is said to open the souls of the long night. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: “For me, block and seal the Gate of Death, so that the Jade Flower of the Thearch may secure my Cinnabar Prime’s domain. Unbind the seven generations of ancestral souls in darkness, ascending them to the Southern Palace.”\n\nThe qi of the Lord of the Spirit Treasure resides in the Lower Cinnabar Field, which is the Yellow Court—the repository of spirit generation. The scripture states: “Dispersing transforms the five forms, transmuting into the myriad spirits.” This is called the “Inner Chapter” of the Yellow Court. Thus it is said to govern the myriad spirits. The Great One unites all spirits, which is to say, it gathers and restrains them. The Thearch is the Meeting of the Brahma-Realm. All the above are the spirits of the one body, explained in detail below.\n\nOnce the form is structured, the four limbs and five constituents are all complete. In the ninth month, the spirits are arrayed, and one is about to become human. If a scholar of the Dao understands this principle, the Three Officials become the Three Treasures, and the Nine Heavens converge as one. Thus one will never perish or decay, ascending to the Nine Heavens. How could the Dao be distant from humanity? Cease your inaction.\n\nWhen ghostly spirits hear this, they ascend and are promoted. When ordinary people hear this, they attain longevity. When souls in darkness hear this, they are delivered and opened. When withered and decayed things hear this, they emit smoke. When infants hear this, they can speak. When dead remains hear this, they return to being human.\n\nFrom the Celestial Treasure to the scholar: those who attain our Dao become emperors above and kings below. From ghostly spirits to dead remains: those who lose our Dao see light above and become earth below. Yet there is a distinction between reciting and merely hearing. Those who recite attain the Dao—like reciting the words of Yao and practicing the conduct of Yao. Now, alas, failing to attain the Dao, one falls among ghostly spirits, ordinary people, and souls in darkness, far removed from the Dao. Yet if one day they return to hear this scripture: those among ghostly spirits may ascend and be promoted, their names entering the Eastern Florescence, no longer subject to the Three Officials’ ghosts.\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of the Flying Immortal’s Precious Sword*: “Those with talents resembling the worthy and surpassing the multitude, though they die and are recorded by the Three Officials as good and bright ghosts, must wait four hundred years to become rulers of the underworld. From there, they advance one rank every three hundred years.” Yet upon hearing this scripture, they need not wait for the appointed time to ascend and be promoted.\n\nOrdinary people possess all six desires and are called “near-men.” Upon hearing this scripture, the six desires no longer defile them, and they enjoy long life in the world. Souls in darkness are those imprisoned in the earthly dungeons. Upon hearing this scripture, they are delivered to the ranks of the Southern Palace.\n\nThe withered and decayed are plants and trees. Once withered and decayed, their substance no longer remains. Yet how can they emit smoke upon hearing this scripture? This scripture is composed of flying mystery-qi, structured into numinous script. The plants and trees of the world are born of qi. When they emit smoke, smoke is the qi of wood. Within wood lies fire; when substance is present, fire ignites. Now, though withered and decayed, their principle of life is gone. Yet when they encounter this scripture, qi nourishes them, gradually restoring their vital substance. Thus it is said that the withered and decayed emit smoke upon hearing it. If one analogizes to humans, it is the loss of spirit.\n\nThe refined is the withered and decayed thing; smoke is like a person’s qi. If qi no longer remains, is this not a withered and decayed thing? Thus Su Dongpo, harmonizing with Yuanming’s *Poems on Form and Shadow*, wrote: “You are like fire upon smoke; when the fire is spent, you depart.” Only upon reaching this point in the scripture does one realize the wondrous efficacy of the divine, which admits no separation from things.\n\nFormerly, Chongyang said: “One who possesses the Dao carries a gourd, within which is the Great Elixir, mixed with grains. He gives it freely to others. By day’s end, the grains are gone, but the elixir remains. He then says: ‘How meager is the world’s good fortune!’ Thereupon, he leaves the Great Elixir on the withered sea-palm at the Jade Bureau and departs. The next day, he sees the sea-palm revived, the withered and decayed emitting smoke. Is this not the same principle?”\n\nInfants can cry but cannot speak. Upon hearing this scripture, they gain speech, for their orifices open and their faculties sharpen. Dead remains are those whose hun and po souls have each departed, far removed from the human way. Upon hearing this scripture, they return to being human. Formerly, Xu Jia had already died, passing many years. One day, the Venerable Lord cast the Talisman of Great Mystery upon him, reviving him. That was by the power of the talisman; this is by the power of the scripture—different paths converging in the same end.\n\nThe Three Treasures are the profound mystery, the root of the myriad beings. Thus they are not known by ghosts and spirits, nor heard by ordinary people.\n\nThe Three Treasures are the Heavenly Treasure, the Numinous Treasure, and the Divine Treasure. They give birth to Heaven and Earth, empower ghosts and gods, emperors and lords. Utterly quiescent yet unchanging, utterly pure yet unadulterated, they cover the vastness of Heaven and Earth without omission, conceal the depths of ghosts and spirits beyond all description. The ten thousand kinds teem and transform without cease, unfathomable—truly they may be called the profound mystery.\n\nThus the scripture says: “The Dao/Way is the mystery of the myriad things.” The Three Treasures are the mystery within the mystery. “Mystery” is the deep and secluded place, the source of the Great Root and Great Ancestor.\n\nThe *Canon of Supreme Mystery* says: “The mystery of Heaven lies in the northwest, where essence transforms in dense abundance. The mystery of Earth lies in the Yellow Springs, where the po soul is concealed and nurtured. The mystery of Man lies in thought, where the utmost spirit is stored.”\n\nThe *Scripture of Southern Florescence* says: “Auspiciousness arises from the mystery.” The old commentary takes “wei” as the mystery, meaning Kun. Here, the *Canon of Supreme Mystery* points to the Yellow as Kun. The qi of Great Brahmā arises from the northwest; all living things turn to it for sustenance—this is the Dao/Way of establishing Heaven. The po soul is nurtured in Kun, and the ten thousand kinds all flourish—this is the Dao/Way of establishing Earth. Once Heaven and Earth are established, yin and yang are complete. That which is born cannot but be born; that which transforms cannot but transform. Thus it is said: the Three Treasures are the profound mystery, the root of the myriad beings.\n\nEarlier it was said that ghosts and spirits hear this and ascend, while ordinary people hear it and attain longevity. Now it is said that they are not known by ghosts and spirits, nor heard by ordinary people. Before ghosts and spirits knew it, before ordinary people had heard it, and after they have known and heard it—these are not the same, and cannot be spoken of in the same breath.\n\nThose who attain this Dao/Way cannot be fully explicated. How could it be grasped by the commonplace hearing of the world? The utmost words cannot be casually obtained; the Dao/Way of immortals and transcendents is rare indeed.\n\nThose who study the supreme Dao/Way, yearning for immortals and transcendents, may achieve liberation through the corpse when their power and capacity are shallow, unable to ascend with their bones. This is called “extinction and turning the wheel.” If the turning of the wheel has not ceased, the root of life and death remains, and one is not free from the cycle of the six destinies.\n\nThus the Azure Lad said:\n*“To plant the root of extinction,*\n*Uproot the seed of life and death.*\n*Lamenting, you sink into the nine springs—*\n*All for cherishing the bodily frame.”*\n\nThe seed of life and death is the turning wheel. If one enters the turning wheel, one may stray from the human way and find it difficult to regain a human form. If even a human form is hard to regain, how much more so for those who yearn for immortals and transcendents?\n\nYet this scripture speaks of liberation through the corpse as a means to escape the turning wheel and ultimately join the immortal Dao/Way. However, if one’s merit and conduct are not yet full, one’s name remains in the ghostly registers, and one is not free from the pursuit of the Three Offices. Thus, one temporarily lodges the form in the clefts of cliffs and the depths of valleys, where the Great Unity guards the corpse, the three hun souls tend the bones, the seven po souls protect the flesh, and the embryonic spirit binds the qi. Over time, one is reborn.\n\nMoreover, the Dao/Way of liberation through the corpse has many methods: ingesting the elixir knife and worms flow out; rinsing with the flow of the embryo and dying in stages; drinking jade nectar and knocking on the coffin; consuming the golden elixir and announcing the end. Some leave their heads in one place and their bodies in another; some shed their bodies while their hair remains. In general, this is because their cultivation in a single lifetime was not complete. Thus, the Immortal Duke attained perfection after seven generations, and the Supreme Ultimate achieved fruition after a hundred bodies.\n\nOnce one has achieved liberation through the corpse, one employs the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* to secure the bodily form. Then the vital fluids do not dry up, and the gates of death close. The *Scripture of Arrayed Records* says: “The reason a human body decays and rots is that there are thirty-nine places where it receives ghostly qi. The form has interstices, the blood has deficiencies, the dead qi advances daily, and perverse qi is drawn in. The spirit and essence do not circulate, the fluids stagnate, and the hundred spirits flee.” Thus the scripture speaks of the dead qi fixing the root, the true radiance not being preserved, and the vital qi lacking its springs.\n\nThe “true radiance” is the true spirit. To merely receive a single form, drifting along as if borrowing qi—though one has this body, if one does not understand the Dao/Way of generating the spirit, how is this different from a walking corpse?\n\nIf one attains this method, one may sit and govern the natural. This refers specifically to the *Scripture of Generating the Spirit* as a shortcut, bypassing liberation through the corpse and directly entering the Great Vehicle.\n\nWhere is this method found? The scripture says:\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating the Spirit* is the flying mystery-qi of the Three Caverns, the threefold harmony that forms sound and coalesces into numinous script. It blends the hundred spirits as one. Within the human body, nothing is not born of these three qi. Once one receives this qi, one unites with the Primordial Beginning, thereby merging with the hundred spirits—where qi resides, spirit follows.\n\nAt first, the three qi generate the three spirits; the three divisions and eight luminaries become the twenty-four spirits. If one constantly merges with the twenty-four spirits, one transforms into the Three-Five Perfected, coalescing into the Orthodox Unity and uniting as the Thearch Lord. Though their number be a hundred thousand myriad millions, one may still merge with them. Thus yang summons yin, and they move without fixed direction. Yang qi transforms into dragon chariots, yin qi becomes jade maidens, dancing upon the wheels of the empty mystery, seated to attain spontaneity—how could this be deception?\n\nThe Three Treasures are revered, the Nine Heavens’ Perfected are supreme. The secrecy is profound, sealed within ninefold golden lattices and the Purple Yang Jade Terrace. Unless heaven and earth are newly opened, its text does not emerge. It is the Primordial Beginning’s forbidden scripture, not for the hearing of ghosts and spirits. Whoever steals it suffers the wind-blades for ten thousand kalpas, their souls dying without rebirth. Those who uphold the precepts and revere it attain immortality in both form and spirit.\n\nThe sagely heart of aiding beings knows no end, yet it abides above the myriad heavens—who in the world could know it? Thus the scriptures of the Three Caverns are disseminated among humanity, for they are none other than the sagely heart’s voice. To recite this scripture now is to attain that heart, and through that heart to commune with all sages. Since the scripture exists, the sages exist as well—how could it not be revered?\n\nThe *Scripture of Generating the Spirit* is the ancestral qi of heaven and earth, the parent of all living beings. Even the Three Treasures hold it in reverence—how much more should humans? In the Six Caverns of Fengdu’s palaces, there is a special tribunal for the crime of slandering the Mahāyāna of the Three Treasures. This scripture is the speech of the Three Treasures; to slight its words is no different from slander. The Nine Heavens’ Perfected are supreme.\n\n“Supreme” means highest. “The secrecy is profound” refers to the repository of the scriptures. According to the *Seven Transformations’ Dance of Heaven Scripture*, the Supreme Clarity’s treasured scriptures number three hundred scrolls, the jade instructions nine thousand chapters, the talismanic diagrams seven thousand sections, along with the scriptures of spontaneity—all are concealed above the Nine Heavens in the Palace of Great Existence. The Palace of Great Existence is the Jade Clarity Palace.\n\nFurther, according to the *Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance Scripture*, the ninefold golden lattices and Purple Yang Jade Terrace—“ninefold” denotes the depth of the seals, while “lattice” refers to a kind of desk or stand. As the *Scripture of the Daoist Treasure* states, there are jade lattices and golden lattices, both belonging to the Nine Heavens. Above the Three Passes is the Jade Terrace, upon which rests the jade lattice where the Supreme August Perfected’s golden name is placed. This is not only revered but also a secret text. Unless the Dragon Han opens the charts and the Divine Kings risk transgression to earnestly entreat, how could one behold this scripture? Thus those who steal it incur punishment, while those who revere it attain immortality. Those who steal it should indeed take warning, and those who revere it should strive diligently.\n\nIn the Three Primes’ palaces, those whose golden names are recorded and whose purple characters are inscribed in the registers are destined in their next lives to become Perfected Immortals of the Three Clarities. When the karmic conditions align, they should present golden treasures to their masters, sincerely follow the precepts, and receive the scripture through covenant. They must guard their hearts and practice diligently, taking care never to leak it lightly, lest the wind-blades examine their bodies. The Three Primes’ judgment extends not only to the dead souls but to all—both those who have attained the Dao/Way and those who have not. Only those with golden names and purple characters are distinguished as students of immortality. Thus, in the records of the repositories, the Three Primes’ judging officials and the ranks of hell are called the “Ink Registers.” Those with golden names and purple characters are truly set apart from them.\n\nFormerly, Li Jue was a commoner of Jiangyang. His merit and conduct had long been recorded in the immortal registers. Though he had not yet ascended to heaven, his name was already inscribed in gold in the Huayang Grotto-Heaven. Not only students of immortality possess such distinctions. In secular records, when Emperor Yuan of Liang was Prince of Xiangdong, he once recorded loyal ministers, righteous scholars, and those with fine literary works, inscribing them with three grades of brushes: loyal and filial ones with golden tubes, those of virtuous conduct with silver tubes, and those with fine literature with mottled bamboo tubes.\n\nThe *Supreme Jade Instructions Scripture* states: In the Purple Tenuity Palace are golden lattices and jade books, red-gold writings, and azure jade tablets—all of this kind. If one has planted good roots in past lives and exhausted this karmic body, in the next life one will become a Perfected Immortal of the Three Clarities. Naturally, one will encounter this scripture, and one must then present golden treasures, follow the precepts, and receive it through covenant before one may cultivate. Otherwise, one will surely face the wind-blades’ examination.\n\nThese words bear repeating, for they are established for the intermediate and lesser vehicles. The wind-blades’ examination has been mentioned repeatedly in previous chapters: “the wind-blades for ten thousand kalpas, souls dying without rebirth,” and later, “the wind-blades’ mutual punishment”—how could one not be cautious?\n\nWhen the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings received the obeisance, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable said to them: “The treasured scripture is profoundly secret, the numinous sounds of the Nine Heavens, bestowed upon the supreme sages—not for the hearing of ghosts and spirits. The Perfected’s lattices are revealed once every forty thousand kalpas. Now, transgressing the prohibition, I entrust it to you—guard it well, and never transmit it lightly.” These words only caution against careless transmission. Is not the wind-blades’ examination established for those of the intermediate and lesser vehicles?\n\nThe *Celestial Precepts of the Supreme* state: “Those who transmit celestial scriptures and bring calamity upon their ancestors incur the grave sin of violating their proclamations, preventing the breach of their covenants.” Thus, the upper chapter of the *Black Register* records the Water and Fire Officials, and beyond them, the Wind-Blade Left and Right Officials. The Left Wind Examiner oversees those who receive scriptures, talismans, treasured instructions, or precepts without covenant, who cultivate for profit, sell the Dao/Way, or violate celestial statutes. The Right Blade Examiner governs those who break their vows, betray their masters and friends, abandon one for another, judge good and evil, or attack the root—none greater than these sins.\n\nThe transmission of the *Luminous Writ of the Great Empyrean*—where one imparts it upon encountering the worthy without fixed number—differs greatly from this. The method of cultivation requires a thousand-day fast, disengagement from worldly affairs, the cessation of all sensory leaks, a mind stilled to silence, the holding of incense and precepts, entry into the chamber facing east, nine knocks of the teeth, the modulation of voice to rectify qi, and the recitation of sacred scriptures. One summons the perfected to refine the body; when the body is purified, qi harmonizes. One embraces the Dao/Way to refine qi; when qi is purified, the spirit rejoices. Such is the method of the long fast.\n\nAs *Zhuangzi* states: “When the cosmos is at peace and settled, the radiance of heaven emerges.” The settled cosmos refers to the stilled mind. The essence of generating the spirit lies in nothing beyond this. All else is but worldly affairs. Before the minds of beings are aligned, the heart drifts like floating dust, clashing and grinding with things, racing like wind and blazing like fire, gradually stained by the dust of the world, never ceasing for a moment. After the fast, spirit and qi return to unity. For the spirit resides in the ears to hear, in the eyes to see, in the tongue to taste, in the heart to transform, and in the intent to shift swiftly—ever roaming among the six senses. Now, with the six senses unengaged and all sensory leaks stanched, the teachings speak of eight leaks: tears from the eyes, a leak of the liver; mucus from the nose, a leak of the lungs; saliva from the mouth, a leak of the kidneys; external sweat, a leak of the heart; night sweats, a leak of the small intestine; drooling in sleep, a leak of the brain; dreams of coupling with ghosts, a leak of the spirit; and lust, a leak of the body. All these leaks arise from the interplay of the five aggregates, six senses, and twelve sense-realms. If the body is filled with emptiness, hearing confined to the ears, and the mind fixed upon the talisman, then the sensory realms have no means of entry.\n\nOf old, Master Ge fasted for a thousand days on Mount Tiantai. Before a year had passed, he achieved resonance, and the lofty sages deigned to glance into his secluded chamber. Later generations’ methods of fasting trace their origin to this. Lord Yan the Perfected said: “Empty the heart to seek virtue/power; still the intent to await the numinous.” Since the hearts of beings have not yet merged with the Dao/Way, they are first taught the method of fasting, that through fasting they may quiet the heart, and through quieting the heart enter the Dao/Way. Yet later ages have inflamed it with worldly affairs, entangled it with form and instrument, and thus regard the fasting method—how grievously mistaken! The libationer-daoists have become mere corpse-invocators.\n\nFacing east upon entering the chamber draws upon the qi of life. Modulating the voice rectifies qi; profound resonance gathers the spirit—all essential elements of scripture recitation. Reciting once, the sound ascends to the nine heavens. Reciting twice, heaven and earth display reverence. Reciting thrice, the three realms bow to the chamber. Reciting four times, the Heavenly Kings descend as immortals. Reciting five times, the Five Emperors attend the perfected. Reciting six times, the Demon Kings bind themselves. Reciting seven times, the stellar constellations halt their gates. Reciting eight times, the darkest night is illuminated. Reciting nine times, all heavens descend, and every spirit and numen shields the chamber with their chariots.\n\nThe preceding chapter on cultivation methods speaks of nothing but returning to the body to perfect sincerity. Once one can return to the body, one becomes one with heaven, thereby attaining the utmost knowledge of heaven’s workings and humanity’s workings. The “utmost” refers to the harmonization of the boundary between heaven and humanity, rendering it seamless. Thus, reciting once, the sound ascends to the nine heavens—uttered here, heard there, signifying the scrutiny of above and below. Reciting twice, heaven and earth display reverence. The *Scripture of Salvation* speaks of heaven and earth offering rites, its meaning largely the same. Yet “reverence” and “rites” differ in weight; only when reverence gives rise to rites is perfection attained. Reciting thrice, the three realms bow to the chamber, showing that “rites” surpass “reverence.” Reciting four times, the Heavenly Kings descend as immortals. The scriptures contain titles such as Dharma King and Heavenly King, all exalted appellations of the lofty sages. “Descending as immortals” refers to the summoning of divine immortals to gather at the site, as when Master Ge studied the fasting method and beckoned the Primordial Immortal Xu Laile to descend into his quiet chamber.\n\nReciting five times, the Five Emperors attend the perfected, as when Lady Wei attained the Dao/Way and the Five Elderly Lords descended to her chamber, transmitting to her the Five Emperors’ staffs of authority. Reciting six times, the Demon Kings bind themselves. The *Guardian Numinous Incantation* speaks of the Demon Kings binding their heads and bodies—though the wording differs, the principle is the same. “Bind” means to restrain. Only after six recitations do the Demon Kings begin to restrain themselves, preventing reckless movement lest they provoke trials. Those who study the Dao/Way face many demonic trials: first the lesser trials of the Zi hour, then the great trials. Only after passing these two trials will the Demon Kings vouch for them, allowing ascent to the immortal ranks.\n\nYet the Demon Kings do not bind themselves at five or seven recitations, but only at six—why? The great demons of the six heavens are the residual qi of the six heavens, known as the supreme yin ghost-lords, their power equal to that of heaven. The Primordial Beginning commanded their creation along with the demons. Thus, the methods of fasting and offering in Daoist scriptures must first subdue them before success can be achieved. Six is the number of old yin, its might vast and great; hence, the fasting method must first command the demons at the Wu hour. This is the reason: the first yin arises at Wu, so one must first block its inception; if one acts too late, it cannot be remedied.\n\nOften seen at yellow altars with ten cases of incense, the initial night’s vigil begins in the north, the position of Zi. When refining the great elixir, one ignites the fire at the moment of first yang, proceeding through the six positions to the northeast, the Gen direction—precisely the ghostly realm, the abode of the six demons. This is Master Yuchan of Floating Mountain’s method of commanding demons. The unenlightened mistake it for merely commanding earthly demons, unaware that the great demons of the six caverns are none other than the great demons of the heavens above.\n\nDuring the time of the Han Celestial Master, distinctions were made between humans and ghosts, first by driving away the demons of the Six Heavens and consigning them to Northern Feng. Though called the Six Caverns of Fengdu, they are in truth celestial realms—one must not cling to their earthly locations. Within the Northern Capital of Luo Feng, the land of utmost yin, there also reside the immortal officials of the Six Caverns, who constantly examine and tally the records of those studying the immortal arts, governing the registers of the Three Realms. As the *Scripture of Salvation* states: \"The A-ren sings the Cavern Chapters to subdue Northern Luo Feng.\" Since the Cavern Chapters are sung, what connection do they have with Fengdu? Yet when it says \"subdue Northern Luo Feng,\" it refers to the demons of Luo Feng, who are in fact the chiefs of all demons. The following line, \"Expel and dispatch the demonic essences, sever the blades of the Six Ghosts,\" makes its meaning abundantly clear. Moreover, after the incantation for commanding demons, phrases such as \"the Three Heavens revolve in brightness\" and \"the Six Heavens come to their end\" appear—yet none understand their import. Since it is called \"commanding demons,\" what is being commanded? Many feign wisdom in vain.\n\nRecently, in the *Comprehensive Teachings Collection*, the transmitted practices can be discerned. However, Master Yuchan’s oral teachings were passed down from mouth to mouth and never committed to writing, lest they be leaked. I dare not speak of them recklessly.\n\n**Seven Passings: The Stellar Lodge Halts the Barrier**\nWhen the Most High Lord of the Dao expounded the *Scripture of Salvation*, the Celestial Pivot and Jade Balance halted their turning for a time. This scripture refers to it as \"halting the barrier,\" alluding to the handle of the Dipper. The seventh star of the Northern Dipper is called the Celestial Barrier Star, also known as Po Jun. The direction it points is where ghosts and spirits retreat, and practitioners of the Dao call this \"the unyielding qi.\"\n\n**Eight Passings: The Radiance of the Dark Night**\nIn the place of utmost yin, where neither sun nor moon shines, how can stagnant souls ascend and be delivered? This was the method Li Ruochong used to offer prayers for Zhang Lihua.\n\n**Nine Passings: The Descent of All Heavens**\nAll divine spirits, without exception, attend in reverence. Once the Nine Passings are complete, the merit thus accrued is such that the corpse abides while the dragon appears, the abyss is silent while thunder resounds—these are things that arise spontaneously, not by design. Long ago, Li Shunxing recited the *Great Cavern Scripture* for three years. One night, suddenly, thousands of flying immortals gathered in the sky, their divine radiance illuminating his chamber. What is cultivated here manifests there—how could this be mere deception?\n\n**One Passing: Penetrating the Heavens**\nThe primordial womb and its origins are fully opened and made clear.\n\nThe true essence of the Dao is for the cultivation of the self; what remains may be applied to the state, and what is left over may be used to govern the world. One must first perfect the self before extending to others—this is the proper sequence of self-cultivation.\n\nYet this scripture requires a thousand-day fast, detachment from worldly affairs, and the complete cessation of all defilements. Only then, with a mind stilled and thoughts silent, can one commit to memory the number of recitations, wherein the merit of resonance with the cosmos arises. Here, in this chapter, the Nine Passings are again recorded, beginning with the self—does this not invert the proper order?\n\nThe methods of cultivation may proceed from within to without, or from without to within. Those who cultivate from within to without perfect the self, and their virtue becomes genuine. Those who proceed from without to inward may place the self last, yet the self comes first.\n\nCareful reflection on the scripture’s intent reveals no discrepancy with the preceding chapter. However, the merit of a single Passing reverberates through the Nine Heavens, and the primordial womb is fully opened—these principles admit of two explanations, hence they are recorded separately.\n\nAs the *Scripture of Salvation* states: reciting it once causes all the great sages of the heavens to praise it in unison; after ten recitations, withered bones revive and rise as living beings—this records the merit of ten recitations. Elsewhere it says: reciting it once summons the boundless hosts of the Perfected and Great Spirits of the Eastern Limitless Realm, who descend floating through the void—this records the principle of resonance. The sequence here mirrors that of this scripture; scholars must not cling to one approach alone.\n\n**One Passing: Penetrating the Heavens** opens the primordial womb and its origins—this refers to the beginning of human life. By the **Nine Passings**, the fundamental joints and origins simultaneously generate the gods, thereby expounding the teachings of self-cultivation. The meaning of the **Chapter on Generating the Gods** thus becomes clear.\n\nBefore birth, one dwells in darkness, devoid of light, without agency, suspended in obscurity. Though free from the fetters of affliction, even after countless eons, one remains but a wandering spirit, a suffering shade—what benefit is there? Zhuangzi lamented the metal in the crucible, grieving that after becoming human, one merely rots like grass and wood, deeming non-existence more peaceful. Those who fail to awaken seize upon this as justification, and those who speak of longevity dismiss it as an excrescence—truly, they are sinners within the teachings. Such is the fate of those who cultivate imperfectly and perish midway, using this as an excuse—how can this be worthy?\n\nThere are those who disdain life, regarding the four great elements as a temporary abode, enduring thirst without drinking, hunger without eating, lacking means to ward off cold or attain satiety. Their bodies wither, their mouths speak of suffering and emptiness, and they sit awaiting death. It is like dismantling a house to live exposed, or taking medicine to induce illness when no sickness exists—how can this accord with human nature? If this were deemed correct, heaven and earth would nearly cease to function.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy and Divine Kings, pitying such inverted views, thus composed the **Chapter on Generating the Gods**, awakening people to the truth that this body is born alongside heaven and earth. If one cultivates according to what is generated and refines what ought to be generated, this is the Dao of long life. Otherwise, Zhuangzi’s lament for the metal in the crucible remains apt. As Shao Kangjie’s poem says: *\"To die in vain a thousand times is just as if one had never been born.\"*\n\nWhen a person is conceived, essence and blood form the womb, gestating in the mother’s palace for three hundred days before the fetus is complete. At the moment essence and blood coalesce into the womb, a yellow, evolving qi emerges as the origin of life. If this qi flows unimpeded, ascending and descending without losing its measure, the principle of life gradually takes shape. If the womb’s source is obstructed, premature death or stillbirth may occur. Thus, the *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir* states: *\"If the Great One congeals, the nine qi stagnate and fail to transform; the Three Ones grieve and cannot gather, allowing the qi of death to enter, preventing completion.\"*\n\n**Two Passings: Resounding the Earth** unbinds the root of the fetal knot. Heaven is one, earth is two—these are the numbers of heaven and earth. Sound arises and echoes, yang initiates and yin responds. In the second month of human gestation, the fetus begins to take shape, marking the inception of form. Yet birth is the root of death; once the fetal form is established, the qi of death solidifies its root. Thus, those who perish in the womb or die before birth are not uncommon. Hence, the second chapter states: *\"Sever the root, seal the gate of death, nurture the infant with brightness and harmony.\"* Once the fetal root is unbound and the principle of life gradually matures, it is like the Supreme One Emperor Lord’s method of resolving the three barriers and twelve knots with cinnabar talismans inscribed on green bamboo membranes—this is recorded in the *Upper Clarity Cavern Mystery Scripture*.\n\n**Three Passings: Spirit Transforms** refines the Gate of the Hun into immortality. Heaven-one generates water, which in humans becomes essence; heaven-three generates wood, which in humans becomes the hun-soul. At the third Passing, the hun-soul first takes form. The *Scripture of Jade Mushroom Immortals* states: *\"In the third month of gestation, yin and yang divide.\"* Once yin and yang separate, the hun-soul arises on the left and the po-soul on the right—this is an inevitable principle. Those who cultivate must first restrain the hun and control the po. The hun pertains to mercury, the po to lead. Mercury’s nature is volatile; at death, the hun departs first. The *Scripture of Salvation* says: *\"The lofty, pure, and numinous spirits sing mournfully in the vast sky\"*—lamenting the death of humans.\n\nAt conception, once the hun-soul is complete, the physical form is established, entering the Gate of Primordial Simplicity, where yin and yang separate and intermingle. The left is the Gate of the Hun, the right the Door of the Po. Once the hun is refined, the dead may be revived, and the living may attain immortality—hence the term *\"extending the heavens\"* refers to the qi of enlightened immortality. The character *\"refine\"* (炼) here denotes the process of silk purification, as used frequently in the scriptures, rather than the character for *\"smelting\"* (炼). It signifies the primordial simplicity—the fundamental origin of human life, for *\"when the root is established, the Dao is born.\"*\n\nAt the time of Primordial Simplicity, when hardness and softness first separate, one takes its pure essence—like silk purified to whiteness—thus easily attaining immortality. Hence the later passage speaks of *\"the floating, floating refined silk blossom,\"* its meaning identical to this. When the Four Celestial Kings descend to bestow immortality, the Door of the Po closes its gate.\n\nThe fourth phase generates metal, which in humans becomes the lungs—the repository of the po-soul. The third phase speaks of the Gate of the Hun, while the fourth speaks of the Door of the Po, for these are the gates and doors of the entire body. Moreover, at the beginning of human life, the kidneys form first, followed by the spleen. The spleen then generates the liver, and the liver in turn generates the lungs. Between liver and lungs lie the gates of transmission and conduction.\n\nThe kidneys belong to water, yet within water resides fire; when ascended, it becomes qi. Riding this qi upward, it pays homage to the heart. The heart generates fluid, which bears yin downward to return to the kidneys. Without the liver and lungs to transmit and conduct, how could the union be achieved to form the Dragon and Tiger? Thus, the greatest obstacle for ancient immortals and perfected ones in refining the elixir lay in the separation between metal and wood.\n\nNow, if the liver can transmit the kidney’s qi to pay homage to the heart, and the lungs can conduct the heart’s fluid to reach the kidneys—timing without error—then the Yellow Sprout will arise. This is called the Golden Elixir. How magnificent!\n\nYet if it speaks of transmission and conduction, why also say the Door of the Po closes its gate? This refers to the gate at the beginning of life, before cultivation has begun. Fearing that the qi of death might harm the qi of life, it is thus commanded to close its gate.\n\nIn the fifth phase, the Five Emperors pay homage to the perfected, and the viscera become clear and frozen. By the fifth month of human life, the five viscera are fully formed, and the spleen’s count is complete. What appears within is called the *zang*, while what appears without is called flesh. Then the Five Emperors naturally pay homage: the Green Emperor guards the hun, the White Emperor attends the po, the Red Emperor nurtures qi, the Black Emperor circulates blood, and the Yellow Emperor presides at the center—none of the myriad spirits transgress this order.\n\nThe six bowels arise as earth generates fire, which then generates the small intestine; the small intestine generates the large intestine; the large intestine generates the gallbladder; the gallbladder generates the stomach; the stomach generates the bladder; together with the Triple Burner, these form the six bowels.\n\nAlas! Without the other, there is no self; without the self, there is nothing to take. Thus, the self depends on the other, and the other depends on the self. The wonder of spirit-generation lies not merely in its absence of traces—it may truly be called natural.\n\nThe Six Perils’ Demon Kings submit in acquiescence, and the stomach duct generates fluid. The five viscera all possess fluid, but only the left kidney governs it. Now, the stomach belongs to earth, and water is halted by earth—thus the stomach duct becomes the receptacle for fluid. The *Immortal Canon of Visualization Techniques* states: \"Visualize at the stomach’s opening a wondrous girl-infant, naked and unclothed, standing upright within the stomach duct. She opens her mouth to receive and channel the numinous liquid, inhaling the five qi upward, drawing them into her mouth to swallow, then sending them into the mouth of the Mysterious Maiden.\" All that a person eats and drinks gathers in the stomach, silently refined by the scorching fire. The pure becomes fluid, ever moistening like cloud and rain, ascending to the Nine Heavens; the turbid descends as dregs, like excrement and earth, excreted into the Nine Earths. When gathered in the mouth, it becomes water; when refined by the lungs, it becomes spittle; when refined by the heart, it becomes blood; when refined by the kidneys, it becomes essence—none of these are other than fluid. As the *Pointers to the Mysterious* states: the heart and kidneys form the cinnabar origin, while the liver and kidneys serve as the fire’s regulator. At noon, sit in quiet seclusion, close the eyes and still the mind, hold the fluid in the mouth, and draw the breath subtly through the nose to its utmost. Retain the fluid to press it down, and the true dragon will not ascend; draw the breath to withdraw it, and the true tiger will not descend. Passing through the Yellow Court, this becomes the constant of the Mysterious Pearl, which when employed washes and purifies the chest and intestines. Thus the scripture says: \"The numinous fluid is locked in place, its source ever-flowing and moistening.\" The Perfected One often told people: \"The human body requires moisture.\" Yet most do not understand this—what a pity!\n\nThe Seven Perils’ stellar lodges shine brightly, and the orifices open to keen perception. Heaven has the seven luminaries, and humans have the seven apertures. Those that traverse the five circuits by night are the seven luminaries; those that course through the five viscera are the seven apertures. In the seventh month of gestation, the essence of the seven stars opens the seven apertures, enabling sight, hearing, eating, and breathing. While the seven apertures are uniform in all people, their acuity varies. Yet acuity originates in the heart, for the heart belongs to spirit and fire, and fire illuminates things. Seven is the number of lesser yang and belongs to metal; only when metal becomes an instrument can it carve and open. Thus, the most intelligent possess seven apertures in the heart, the average have five, the lesser have three, the perceptive have two, the ordinary have one, and the foolish have none. Zhuangzi said: \"Is it only the body that may be deaf and blind? Even wisdom may be so.\" Those who are dull and ignorant, whose acuity remains unopened, are not bound by their apertures—it is rather a matter of innate endowment.\n\nThe Eight Perils’ dark night reveals its light, and the Three Regions and Eight Sceneries fully integrate form and spirit. Human life begins with the primal qi as its ancestor. From one comes three, and from three united with five arise the Eight Sceneries. Three eights make the twenty-four spirits—this is the transformation of yin and yang. If one knows this transformation, then the cosmos lies within the palm, and creation arises within the body. The Daoist *Record of the Covenant of Might* takes the Three Origins and Five Virtues Generals as its essence and function, transforming them into twenty-four stages corresponding to the twenty-four qi—this is precisely what is meant. As for transformation, none surpasses that of yin and yang. Now, three and five are the numbers of the sun and moon, with *wu* and *ji* paired with *kan* and *li*. Humans receive the qi of yin and yang, the Three Origins and Five Movements, uniting them within the body. Transforming and harmonizing them, they naturally align with the twenty-four qi within the Supreme Ultimate. Thus the *Yellow Court Canon* says: \"The Way of nurturing life is not burdensome—simply cultivate the *Cavernous Mystery* and *Jade Chapters*, along with the Eight Scenery Spirits within the body, and the twenty-four Perfected will emerge naturally.\" Therefore, the *Plain Questions and Spiritual Pivot* states: \"The twenty-four qi intermingle in yellow chaos, congealing into qi and transforming. Within the qi dwell twenty-four spirits, congealing into numen and generating life—not from the womb, but all from the qi of the Three-One Imperial Stars.\" Now, if the Three Regions and Eight Sceneries fully integrate form and spirit, yet are said not to originate from the womb, how then may one attain them in the human body? Those who attain them must begin with self-cultivation. As the immortal Xu the Grand Master’s instructions say: \"At dawn, visualize the Upper Scenery; at noon, the Middle Scenery; at midnight, the Lower Scenery.\" The *Treasured Jade Record* states: \"One who does not visualize the twenty-four qi or know the names of the Three Regions and Eight Sceneries cannot be a citizen of Great Peace, nor a minister of the Later Sage.\" Thus, the Perfected Lords of West City and the Paulownia-Cypress Immortal both practiced this method to attain the Dao. The names and numbers of the twenty-four spirits are respectfully recorded below.\n\n**Upper Eight Sceneries:**\nSpirit of the Fontanel, Spirit of the Hair, Spirit of the Skin, Spirit of the Eyes, Spirit of the Neck, Spirit of the Ears, Spirit of the Nose, Spirit of the Tongue.\n\n**Middle Eight Sceneries:**\nSpirit of the Throat, Spirit of the Lungs, Spirit of the Heart, Spirit of the Liver, Spirit of the Gallbladder, Spirit of the Left Kidney, Spirit of the Right Kidney, Spirit of the Spleen.\n\n**Lower Eight Sceneries:**\nSpirit of the Stomach, Spirit of the Large Intestine, Spirit of the Small Intestine, Spirit of the Navel, Spirit of the Diaphragm, Spirit of the Knees, Spirit of the Left Yin and Left Yang, Spirit of the Right Yin and Right Yang.\n\nThe remaining forms, incantations, and instructions cannot be fully recorded here. I once saw the commentary by Wang Shen of Poyang on the Three Regions and Eight Sceneries, which called them the Eight Trigrams—how laughable! Thus, I have written this out to enlighten later students and prevent such errors.\n\nThe Nine Perils’ myriad heavens descend in observation, and the Three Passes, Five Viscera, Six Bowels, Nine Palaces, Golden Towers and Jade Chambers, Twelve Heavy Gates, Purple Portals and Jade Caskets, and thirty-six thousand joints—all their roots and origins simultaneously generate spirit. Before a person receives life, in the boundless void, this is called the Supreme Simplicity. When it transforms into qi, this is called the Supreme Origin. When qi transforms into form, this is called the Supreme Beginning. Yin receives yang and generates life, qi follows the transformation of the embryo—this is called the Supreme Simplicity. When the numinous light enters the body and separates from the mother, after ten months of gestation, this is called the Supreme Ultimate. At the moment of birth, the myriad spirits are all complete—from whence do they come? Life is the great virtue of Heaven and Earth. The Way of Heaven values life, and it is through life that they are attained.\n\nThe Three Passes: The *Yellow Court Scripture* designates the mouth as the Heavenly Pass, the hands as the Human Pass, and the feet as the Earthly Pass. The immortal scriptures take the Mud-Pill Palace as the Upper Pass, the Crimson Palace as the Middle Pass, and the Lower Cinnabar Field as the Lower Pass. Only the Perfected One of True Yang considers the twenty-four vertebrae of the spine, each pass comprising three joints. Below the brain is called the Jade Pass; the spine itself is called the Middle Pass; and the region opposite the inner kidneys is called the Lower Pass. Alternately, the eyes are taken as the Upper Pass, the nose as the Middle Pass, and the mouth as the Lower Pass.\n\nThe five viscera are explained in the annotations above. Once the five viscera and six bowels generate spirit, the large intestine becomes the Jade Hall Bowel, the small intestine the Primordial Yang Bowel, the left bladder the Supreme Harmony Bowel, the right bladder the Supreme Simplicity Bowel, the stomach the Central Yellow Bowel, and the gallbladder the Supreme Clarity Bowel—these are the six bowels.\n\nThe Nine Palaces: the kidneys are the Cinnabar Prime Palace; the small intestine, the Vermilion Mound Palace; the liver, the Shang Terrace Palace; the gallbladder, the Heavenly Numinous Palace; the spleen, the Yellow Court Palace; the large intestine, the Mysterious Numinous Palace; the lungs, the Ministerial Palace; the bladder, the Jade Chamber Palace; and the heart, the Crimson Empyrean Palace. The *Cavernous Perfection Scripture* states: three-tenths of an inch between the eyebrows is the Twin Cinnabar Palace; one inch inward is the Hall of Light Palace; three inches inward is the Cinnabar Field Palace, also called the Mud-Pill Palace; four inches inward is the Flowing Pearl Palace; five inches inward is the Imperial Palace. One inch above the Hall of Light is the Heavenly Court Palace; one inch above the Cavernous Chamber is the Ultimate Perfection Palace; one inch above the Cinnabar Field is the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace; one inch above the Flowing Pearl is the Supreme August Palace.\n\nThe Golden Tower is the throat, also called the Double Tower. Within it are twelve constables, each wielding a jade halberd to guard it, while the Perfected One resides inside, governing the circulation of qi between above and below. In recent times, Su Dongpo wrote: *\"Frost seals the jade tower, cold raises gooseflesh\"*—referring precisely to this. The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: *\"Within the double tower, twelve rings ascend and descend, all inhabited by Perfected Ones.\"*\n\nThe Jade Chamber is another name for the brain palace. The *Yellow Court Scripture* calls it the Jasper Chamber. The Twelve-Layered Gates refer to the twelve rings of the throat. The Purple Portal, as the *Essential Spirit Middle Scroll* states, lies within the space above the two eyebrows. The *Cavernous Chamber Inner Scripture* says: *\"The two passes of the Purple Portal extend to the Mysterious Essence.\"* The spirit of the Purple Portal is named Tranquil Serenity, styled Dharma King.\n\nThe Jade Casket, as the *Yellow Court* calls it, is the Jade Hall. The thirty-six thousand joints—roots, origins, and beginnings—generate spirit all at once. All the above are the spirits of the body: eighteen thousand yang spirits form the outer landscape, and eighteen thousand yin spirits form the inner spirits, together making thirty-six thousand—a truly unparalleled treasure. If one knows the spirit as spirit, one may wander with creation in the formless; if one does not know the spirit as spirit, one remains endlessly toiling, never witnessing accomplishment—is this not a great sorrow?\n\nNine cycles make one round. When one round is complete, the Three Realms record one’s name, the Five Emperors acknowledge one’s distinction, and one is called a Perfected One. Ten rounds unify qi, enabling mastery over the myriad spirits; demon kings offer protection, and one is listed among the heavens. A hundred rounds unify spirit, allowing one to sit and attain spontaneity; the Supreme Unity grants its talisman, and the Primordial Lord bestows life. A thousand rounds unify numinosity, enabling one to sit in existence or vanish at will; jade lads and maidens serve at one’s command. Ten thousand rounds complete the Way, allowing one to ride the dragon chariot and ascend in broad daylight.\n\nIn speaking of the Way, nothing precedes yin and yang; in speaking of yin and yang, one must seek their interpenetration. My body stands between the two poles; its life is coeval with Heaven and Earth, and its number accords with yin and yang. Front and back follow in succession, high and low continue without end; advantage and harm are not constant, beginnings and endings are not uniform. They mutually aid, mutually generate, mutually restrain, and mutually govern—all is but a single qi. If one knows how to interpenetrate, then creation has principles that may be altered, and one may achieve existence or vanishing at will through cycles.\n\nThe scripture takes nine cycles as one round: ten rounds unify qi, a hundred rounds unify spirit, a thousand rounds unify numinosity, and ten thousand cycles complete the Way—only then may one ascend in daylight. The number of scripture recitations is based on nine, for nine is the utmost of yang, and when things reach their extreme, they transform. The body has nine palaces, externally nine orifices; Heaven has nine heavens, and below are nine tiers. The elixir has nine revolutions, and the method has nine accomplishments. Seven and eight are the reckonings of yin and yang; six and nine are their investigations. Reckoning does not change, but investigation does. Through nine cycles, the Three Passes, Five Viscera, Six Bowels, and Nine Palaces—everywhere—generate spirit, fulfilling the thirty-six thousand. This is not an arbitrary extension to reach that number, but rather the natural result of qi interpenetrating and transforming of itself.\n\nFor example, reciting the scripture once already manifests the free flow of the primordial womb. The word \"flow\" is evident here: if one cannot achieve flow, how does this body differ from a clod of earth? How could one sit in existence or vanish at will? Thus, ten rounds unify qi, and qi congeals into spirit; a hundred rounds unify spirit, and spirit generates numinosity; a thousand rounds unify numinosity, and numinosity achieves perfect transformation and boundless efficacy, fully animating the spirit—only then may one meet the Way. Therefore, ten thousand rounds complete the Way, enabling ascent in broad daylight, the Three Realms recording one’s name, and one’s name inscribed in the heavens—this is truly so.\n\nThe Five Emperors acknowledge one’s distinction, and one is called a Perfected One. If one is a friend of the Five Emperors, one’s rank is equal to theirs—why then is one still called a Perfected One? Because those of the same gate are friends, yet \"friendly distinction\" further differentiates one’s destined realm. For instance, the *Yellow Emperor’s Forty-Four Methods Scripture* states: those who recite the *Great Elixir Hidden Writ*, the *Golden Flower Cavern Chamber*, and the *Feminine Unity Precious Chapter* are thereby called Masters of the Three Caverns and Perfected Ones of the Primordial Radiance.\n\nThe rank of Perfected One corresponds to the High Immortal of the Unified Imperial Cavern and the Mystic Master of the Dao; the rank of Upper Radiance Perfected One corresponds to the Great Master of the Nine Palaces and Upper Immortal. Now, according to the *Forty-Four Methods Scripture*, one may thereby become a Master of the Three Heavens and a Supreme Perfected One, with a rank equivalent to that of a Celestial Minister of the Great Ultimate.\n\nDemon Kings vouch for one’s attainment, first testing and then recommending upon success. To \"sit and attain spontaneously\" is to summon the mobile kitchens of the Six Jia spirits. The *Taiyi Single Talisman* is received by the Primordial Lady at birth. Yet Taiyi comprises five spirits, bearing the five registers of talismans—all part of the Dao of the Supreme Clarity Emperor Lord’s primordial fusion, the esoteric method for seeking immortality and transcendence as a divine immortal.\n\nAccording to the Five Talismans, write in blue ink on white paper, inscribe them on one’s life-destined day, store them in a brocade pouch, and wear them to attain longevity and deathlessness. The Primordial Lady is the title for women who attain the Dao, and thus the Great Dao possesses the deity of Feminine Unity, referring to this.\n\nI, Jin, note from the *Scripture of Great Possession*: the human head contains the Nine Palaces. The Jade Emperor’s Palace is inhabited by the Divine Mother of Jade Clarity; the Heavenly Court Palace by the Perfected Woman of Supreme Clarity; the Ultimate Perfection Palace by the Imperial Consort of the Great Ultimate; and the Supreme August Palace by the Supreme Sovereign Queen. These four palaces are the primordial yin palaces of the celestial origin, where primal qi had not yet arisen, the Five Norms had not yet been heard, and the myriad things were blended in undifferentiated transformation. Heaven and earth endure through these four Perfected Ones. Without knowing the inner names of the Feminine Perfected, one cannot attain immortality in ten thousand cases.\n\nThese four palaces exist within all people; without cultivation, the Perfected Palaces remain empty. When one recites [the scripture] a hundred times, their spirits naturally arise. Thus, the *Yellow Court Scripture* states: \"Within the jade chamber, the Eight Purities gather; the Lady of the Mud-Pill Palace stands at the center.\" To \"sit in disappearance and stand in vanishing\" is to command jade lads and maidens to dispatch affairs east and west—this is the method of guarding the Three Ones.\n\nUpon reaching a thousand recitations, what path remains obstructed? This is what is meant by \"divergent paths converging in a single essential culmination.\" I, Jin, note from the *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Mystic Cinnabar of the Hall of Light*: If a Daoist practices the Supreme Lord’s method of summoning the Three Ones to guard the form, ingests talismans for five years, and thereby meets Perfected Ones, after nine years they will attain spiritual penetration and clairvoyant vision, able to \"sit in disappearance and stand in vanishing,\" command the Six Ding spirits, and be granted by heaven twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens. They will ride clouds and drive dragons, roam and feast in the Jade Palace, and ascend at dawn—thus completing their tasks.\n\n\"Dawn\" refers to the time of the cock’s crow. I, Jin, note from the incantation of the *Mystic Scripture of the Supreme Mystery Emperor*: \"Ascend bodily at dawn and ascend in broad daylight.\" The zenith of heaven is broad daylight; the cock’s first crow is the ascent at dawn. Thus, when visualizing the primordial fusion of Taiyi, this time is often used—it is the hour of generative qi. The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: \"Donning feathered robes, the Eight Winds are driven; steering the Three Purities, one rides the morning clouds.\" How joyous is this!\n\n*Explication of the Wondrous Scripture of the Natural Generation of Spirits in the Nine Heavens of the Mystic and Numinous Treasure, Fascicle the Upper, Concluded*\n\n*Explication of the Wondrous Scripture of the Natural Generation of Spirits in the Nine Heavens of the Mystic and Numinous Treasure, Fascicle the Middle*\n\nInterpreted by Wang Xichao, a Daoist of the Chongxu Abbey in Mianzhou\n\nAt a time of stillness, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning resided in leisure within the Yellow Chamber of the Cloud Palace, amidst seven-jeweled curtains. Cultivating simplicity, refining the true in emptiness and azure, savoring the profound wisdom of the Mystic Treasure, he delved into the subtle principles of generating spirits, the profound mystery of the Great Fusion, and intoned the clarity of the Nine Heavens.\n\nThis scripture lacks a preface. From the inception of the Three Treasures and the arising of qi, heaven and earth were established, and the myriad people and things received life and form. Among these, the reception of human life is the most noble. Thus, the *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating Spirits* is the numinous text formed by the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery. When recited as a Heavenly Treasure, it illuminates the light of heaven and earth. It is known that once heaven and earth were established, they awaited this to become luminous—not through elaborate discourse, hence the absence of a preface.\n\nWithout a preface, the purport of the entire scripture would lack an entry point; thus, this serves as the preface. For scholars who ascend the Dao or attain liberation through the corpse, without this text, it is as if they wander as mere qi. Upon reaching the nine recitations of the scripture, once this text is obtained, one must maintain long-term purity, uphold the precepts, exhaust all worldly defilements, pacify the mind in silent recitation, and then practice this method. Having attained this method, one must complete nine recitations to have one’s name recorded in the Three Realms, be acknowledged as a friend by the Five Emperors, and be called a Perfected One. Yet even as a Perfected One, one is not yet fully accomplished. Only after ten thousand recitations, when the Dao is complete, does one ascend at dawn in broad daylight—thus manifesting the essence and function. This is the main doctrinal section.\n\nHerein, the scripture’s purport reaches its culmination, where the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning bestows it upon the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit King. After the transmission, the ritual concluded, the myriad heavens resumed their positions. The Heavenly Worthy again addressed the Flying Celestial Spirit King, stating that this *Scripture of the Nine Heavens* is the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, and so forth. This constitutes the circulation section.\n\nThough the intervening words are many, within the main doctrinal section, repeated contemplation exhausts their functions, as seen in the main doctrinal section.\n\nThus, the repeated admonitions and warnings serve only to emphasize that the *Primordial Beginning’s Forbidden Writ* must not be lightly transmitted. Thereupon, the Flying Celestial Spirit King entreated again and again, and the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning likewise admonished repeatedly—hence the profusion of words. As for the nine chapters, though they embody the purport of this single scripture and are appended thereafter, they resemble the *Great Brahmā’s Hidden Text* of the *Scripture of Salvation*, composed by the Dao Lord and attached after the preface to the *Scripture of Salvation*, without bearing any distinct meaning. Scholars must discern this for themselves.\n\nThe heart of the sage in saving beings is not unwilling to exhaust hair and skin or soak hands and feet in haste to deliver others. Yet without seeking or welcoming, responding without concealing, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning abides in stillness and seclusion, awaiting the knock before revealing. Unchanging in oneness, this is the utmost stillness. Composing seven-character verses while dwelling in the Elixir Pearl—this is the utmost leisure. The Yellow Chamber of the Numinous Palace is the place of repose, as the *Scripture of Numinous Writ* states: \"The Azure Emperor of the Eastern Sea observed a three-year purification retreat in the Vermilion Tower’s Yellow Chamber.\" The *Scripture of the Inner Sounds of the Myriad Heavens* says: \"The Yellow Chamber’s chamber governs the merits of the Flying Celestial Perfected of the sun and moon.\"\n\nWithin the seven-jeweled canopy, there are two meanings. The Dharma-body’s seven treasures arise from the five phases of heaven and earth that generate this body—none may be lacking. For the practitioner, they are: essence, tears, saliva, fluid, blood, sweat, and tears—these are the seven treasures. Serene and nurturing simplicity, profound is their abode. Empty azure refining the real, congealed is their purity. Immersed in the sweetness of the Cavern’s wisdom, the fullness of the Dao’s flavor. Bending to study the *Engendering the Spirit*, embracing the spirit in stillness. Principles subtle and vast, whistling resounds through the nine heavens.\n\nThe later chapter records the *Principles Subtle and Vast Writ*, its whistled recitations jade-like, its purport identical though its characters slightly differ. Since the Heavenly Worthy has already attained serene nurturing simplicity, empty azure refining the real, immersion in the Cavern’s sweetness, and study of *Engendering the Spirit*, it is known that this Dao’s mystery lies in principles so subtle they lack form. Without form, there is no trace to lodge, and so one whistles aloft in the nine heavens, finding brief contentment therein. As for this Dao, who could fathom it? Whistling issues from the throat in a piercing sound—later generations’ long whistling derives from this.\n\nAt that time, the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit King, the Jade Assistant Prime Minister, and the Four Harmonious Attendants of Dawn, having purified themselves and raised their standards, stood in attendance at his side. Leaning upon his jade countenance, they sensed the marvelous; gazing up at his numinous eyes, their hearts opened in reverence. Secretly glimpsing the spirit chapters, they leapt with joy; feasting upon the celestial sounds, they were reborn. Daring to seize the moment for enlightenment, they exposed their hearts beneath his divine glance.\n\nAt that time—that very moment—the place where the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning presided naturally drew the attendance of ten thousand numina and a thousand perfected. In this scripture, the divine feet are still indicated, along with the Jade Assistant Prime Minister and the Four Harmonious Attendants of Dawn—these are the close ministers. The Spirit King is recorded in the *Scripture of the River Chart* as one of the Flying Celestial Spirit Kings of the ten directions of heaven, lord of all spirits, flying through the three realms, commanding the host of spirits—of which there are nearly three kinds. Some are born from congealed qi, not through womb-delivery. Others are karmic rebirths, having accrued good merit among ghosts and spirits in former lives and now receiving their reward in the position of Spirit King. Still others are karmic manifestations, born through the conditions of accumulated kalpas.\n\nIn the Golden Tower are the Four Heavenly Emperors, called assisting ministers—they are like fathers. Revered as fathers, they decree, proclaim, and propagate—thus they are called prime ministers. The Four Harmonious are like the former and latter ministers of state, the left and right assistants. \"Harmonious\" means accord. The Attendants of Dawn resemble those of the Xuanzheng era, when the flourishing of Daoist learning led to the establishment of Attendants of Dawn—officials who stand at the emperor’s side, awaiting questions with empty minds, hence the purification retreat. The standard they raise is used to summon the ghosts and spirits of the three realms—this is what the Spirit King holds.\n\nBeholding the jade countenance, one senses the marvelous in the heart; gazing up at the numinous eyes, the breast opens in clarity. When the sage abides in leisure, he preserves the spirit through emptiness and accommodates beings with a pure heart. Beings without the Dao’s rectitude are guided to enlightenment, fulfilling their intentions. The \"jade countenance\" speaks of its jade-like purity; the \"numinous eyes\" speak of their penetrating illumination. Thereupon, the Flying Celestial Spirit King, observing the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning bending to study *Engendering the Spirit* and whistling through the nine heavens, felt his heart leap with joy and wished to pose a question. He first declared: \"If I seize this opportunity, I may lay bare my long-held heart.\" Though he spoke of \"daring to offend the numinous eyes,\" without this moment, the *Engendering the Spirit* chapters could not be transmitted. Just as the Flying Celestial Spirit King purified himself and advanced, how could the Heavenly Worthy refuse?\n\nThereupon, the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit King, stepped forward, bowed, and prostrated himself, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: \"This humble servant, by fortunate convergence, has been permitted to attend your numinous chariot. Not deeming my shortcomings too narrow, you have cleansed me in the dark ford, granted me repeated enlightenment of the congealed mystery, and elevated me to the rank of Spirit King, commanding life and death, encompassing the celestial immortals, overseeing the seven awakenings, gazing into distant lands, harmoniously observing the prime minister, and facing the Attendants of Dawn.\"\n\nThis passage records the Flying Celestial Spirit King’s desire to request the transmission of the *Engendering the Spirit* chapters. First, he offered these words to the Heavenly Worthy: \"This humble servant, by fortunate convergence, has been permitted to attend your numinous chariot. Not deeming my shortcomings too narrow, you have cleansed me in the dark ford.\" These are the Spirit King’s humble words. As for \"granted me repeated enlightenment of the congealed mystery, elevated me to the rank of Spirit King, commanding life and death, encompassing the celestial immortals\"—this is the moment for benevolence without refusal. Mencius said: \"In the present age, if not me, then who?\" Carefully savoring the scripture’s words, they resemble the *Dragon Scenery Mysterious Writ Scripture*, which records: \"The Supreme Ultimate Perfected stood before the Dao Lord, prostrating himself to request the marvelous writ. The Most High leaned forward and intoned: 'Subtle and profound indeed! Truly beyond measure. You have ascended to the Supreme Ultimate, encompassing the ancestral lineage of the spirits. Now I entrust this to you—diligently uphold it.'\"\n\nThe discourse now reaches its grand harmony.\n\nAs for the bestowal of oversight over the Seven Awakening Factors and the far-reaching gaze across distant realms, the harmonious observation of the Supreme Ministers, and the audience with the Dawn Attendants—only then does one witness the Spirit King’s ascent to the loftiest rank, where the *Chapter of Engendering the Spirits* must be entrusted to him. Moreover, at the juncture where life and death intersect and the division between good and evil is determined, ensuring not even the slightest error demands a person of towering wisdom and discernment—who else could suffice?\n\n\"Bestowal of oversight\" refers to the imperial mandate of favor and pacification. The \"Seven Awakening Factors\" denote wisdom, for their number is seven, hence the term. This is recorded in the *Scripture on Dispelling Demons*. \"Far-reaching gaze across distant realms\" signifies wisdom illuminating all things without exception. \"Harmonious observation of the Supreme Ministers, audience with the Dawn Attendants\" refers to the preceding passage in the scripture, when the Spirit King stood alongside the Jade Assistants, the Supreme Ministers, and the Four Harmonious Dawn Attendants. It was not merely that the Spirit King seized the moment for enlightenment and communion, desiring to transmit the *Chapter of Engendering the Spirits* to the world below. Rather, in harmoniously observing the Supreme Ministers and the Dawn Attendants, all shared this aspiration. Yet the Spirit King, undeterred by the risk of overstepping, stepped forward and bowed—truly, the benevolent must possess courage.\n\nAt that very moment, seizing the opportunity and responding to the confluence, he trod the Ninefold Great Yang, penetrating the principles of the Yin Talisman, and took the multitudes into his charge. The great cycle neared its end, the reckoning of *jiashen* drew to a close, and the deluge scoured away filth as calamities spread across the heavens. The Three Palaces wielded their brushes, distinguishing the lineages of humanity, assessing merits and transgressions, and separating good from evil.\n\nThe sword of Gan and Yue, though sheathed and hidden, is not without use—yet if drawn at the wrong time, it becomes an ill omen. The piglet’s discarded offspring, though base and unlike medicine, when used appropriately, can serve as the emperor’s teacher. Thus, scholars of resolve do not lack the desire to establish merit, to rescue life and death, but rather, the timing may or may not be opportune.\n\nConsider the Flying Celestial Spirit King, who governs life and death and takes the care of the multitudes as his duty. At the very moment when the great cycle nears its end, the teachings decline, and heaven and humanity suffer in chaos—how could the Spirit King forget his compassionate heart? For the \"opportunity\" is the subtle movement that foreshadows fortune or misfortune. He who perceives the opportunity and acts does not wait until the day’s end—how much more so for a divine being?\n\nThus, the Flying Celestial Spirit King, whose office oversees the Three Realms, rightly treads the Ninefold Great Yang and penetrates the principles of the Yin Talisman—this is his inherent duty. \"Treading\" means encountering. Nine is the number of Yang. It is also said that the Six Qi of Great Yang, from *mao* to *wu*, constitute the Great Yang, signifying its fullness. When Yang reaches its extreme, Yin arises, giving birth to the great flood. \"Penetrating\" means to comprehend. To comprehend the principles of the Yin Registers is thus called the Yin Talisman.\n\n\"The great cycle nears its end, the reckoning of *jiashen* draws to a close\"—this refers to the kalpic cycle. The concept of the kalpic cycle appears frequently in the teachings, with varying interpretations upon examination. The *Crimson Writ Scripture* defines thirty days as one exchange, twelve exchanges as one degree, 3,300 degrees as a minor kalpa, and 9,900 degrees as a major kalpa. According to the calculations of the *Great Evolution*, nineteen years form one chapter, four chapters form one section, twenty sections form one epoch, and three epochs form one era. When 4,620 years complete three eras, it marks the end of one kalpa. However, according to the imperial commentary on the *Scripture of Salvation Through the Celestial Realms*, the Jade Clarity’s kalpic exchange spans 3,000 billion 909,510,000 years, the Highest Clarity’s transformation of essence spans 70 billion 390,000 years, and the Great Clarity’s refinement spans 50 billion 120,000 years. These accounts in the *Crimson Writ* and the *Great Evolution* imperial commentary differ.\n\nFurthermore, according to the *Scripture of the True Dharma*, the heavens have twelve celestial nets, and the earth has twelve terrestrial markers. The heavens’ rigid revolutions complete one cycle in 360 turns, while the earth’s terrestrial mechanisms advance one degree in 330 turns. The heavens’ 3,600 cycles constitute a Yang surge, and the earth’s 3,600 degrees constitute a Yin eclipse. When the heavens’ qi reaches its extreme, it becomes Great Yin; when the earth’s qi reaches its extreme, it becomes Great Yang. Thus, when Yang is stimulated, it surges; when Yin is obstructed, it eclipses. The surge and eclipse of Yin and Yang bring about the transformation of heaven and earth’s qi—this is called a minor kalpa. When minor kalpas intersect, the Ten Thousand Emperors change their positions, the Nine Qi alter their courses, and the sun and moon contract their revolutions. Yet this does not mention the *jiashen* cycle.\n\nHowever, in the *Great Peace Manuscript*, it is said that within the nine-six sequence, there must be major and minor *jiashen* cycles, with *jiashen* as the appointed time, when ghosts confront humanity. Though \"ghosts confronting humanity\" indicates the intersection of life and death, it does not specify *jiazi* or *jiayin*, focusing solely on *jiashen*—why? In my humble consideration, this refers to the transition of cyclical qi, where the cycle shifts but the kalpa has not yet ended, yet it is still called a kalpa. *Jiashen* thus marks the kalpa of cyclical transition.\n\nAccording to this scripture: \"The great cycle nears its end, the reckoning of *jiashen* draws to a close.\" It also states: \"The great reckoning has its appointed time, *jiashen* hangs in its final moment.\" And again: \"The great cycle begins its appointed time, the three and five announce the hour.\" Thus, though *jiashen* brings vast calamity, it is not truly a kalpa. For *jiashen* belongs to Water and occupies the *kun* position, with the Well constellation nearby, the meeting place of the Six Yin. According to Jin astronomical calculations, the Well contains eight stars, the celestial sentinels governing the affairs of the Water Balance. When the cycle reaches this point, how could it not bring a great flood? Thus, the deluge scours away filth, and calamities spread across the heavens—hence the mention of water but not fire. \"Scouring away filth\" means eliminating the wicked.\n\nThe scripture states: \"When the major and minor *jiashen* arrive, the malevolent are eradicated, and the virtuous are delivered. The virtuous become the seed people, while the malevolent become the chaff.\" Noble and virtuous ones, can you not strive?\n\nFrom the era of Crimson Brightness to the first year of the Supreme August, according to the *Primordial Yang Jade Treasury*, those who received deliverance numbered 240,000. Beyond the Six Harmonies, the sages preserve what they do not discuss, for it is difficult to fathom and measure.\n\n*The Jade Chapters of Spirit Generation* is a forbidden scripture of the Primordial Beginning, seldom heard by worldly people—thus, much is omitted in discussion. Regarding the epochs before and after kalpas, there must be a fixed account, yet worldly people inevitably fall into confusion and disorder.\n\nThis sutra states that in the first year of the Dragon Han kalpa, the Heavenly Treasure Lord was born. After the Heavenly Treasure Lord’s birth, the Dragon Han era first unfolded its charts, giving rise to the Numinous Treasure Lord. After one kalpa, in the first year of Crimson Brightness, the Numinous Treasure Lord began delivering people. At that time, the Divine Treasure Lord was born. After two kalpas, in the first year of the Supreme August, the Divine Treasure Lord first revealed the scriptures—such is the kalpic progression of this sutra.\n\nFrom the Dragon Han to Crimson Brightness, then to the Supreme August, the Yan Kang era is not mentioned. Yet if one examines the *Subtleties of the Great Mystery Dao*, before the end of a prior kalpa and the beginning of the next, during the time of primordial chaos, it is universally termed the Yan Kang. Thus, within the three kalpas of Dragon Han, Crimson Brightness, and Supreme August, how could there be no epochs before or after kalpas? Why is the Yan Kang kalpa entirely unmentioned?\n\nMoreover, the *Scripture of Salvation* states: \"Dragon Han and Yan Kang, boundless kalpas of remote antiquity,\" speaking of Yan Kang but omitting Crimson Brightness and Supreme August. Elsewhere, it places Yan Kang before Dragon Han. According to the *Scripture of Daoist Ordinals* and the *Primordial Record of Mount Gui*, only three kalpas are mentioned, and neither Supreme August nor Yan Kang are included.\n\nFurthermore, the Dragon Han is said to last only one year, while the Supreme August varies with accounts of three or eight years. Upon careful examination of the *Scripture of Salvation*, the sequence of Dragon Han, Crimson Brightness, Yan Kang, Kai Huang, and Supreme August aligns with the Five Phases, forming the order of five kalpas. Yet if this sutra’s account is taken as definitive—from Crimson Brightness to Supreme August, delivering 240,000 people, only then speaking of Kai Huang—it follows that Supreme August precedes Kai Huang. This diverges from the five-kalpa sequence, leaving scholars bewildered and uncertain. Those of discernment must investigate further.\n\nThe Primordial Yang belongs to the Purple Tenuity Palace. The *Jade Casket* contains the \"Statutes of Illuminating the Real,\" which address good and evil. The Youth of Supreme Wisdom once inquired of the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning about the retribution of good and evil. Thereupon, the Celestial Venerable commanded the summoning of the flying divine beings from the ten directions to open the Nine Dark Jade Casket of the Long Night’s Repository and produce the \"Statutes of Illuminating the Real\" to deliver humankind. Thus began the Youth of Supreme Wisdom’s illumination of the statutes, which enumerate fourteen transgressions. Hence, the *Threefold Recorded Repentance* states: \"Manifesting the fourteen transgressions, it communicates the repentance of the Nine Dark Realms.\" In recent versions from the Central River region, these have been altered to the \"ten evils.\" Those who, ignorant of principle, presumptuously amend ritual texts seldom escape ridicule.\n\nAfter the Kai Huang era, when the count reaches *jiashen*, the heavens conduct their selection, the offices of immortals lie vacant, their ranks unfilled, and those in wandering appointments all await selection. Previously, *jiashen* was considered a minor kalpa; now, counting from the Kai Huang era to *jiashen* confirms that the *jiashen* kalpa is not singular. Precisely at the time when the kalpic destiny undergoes renewal, those immortals holding office must undergo selection, much like the worldly system of official assessment. That the offices of immortals lie vacant and their ranks unfilled reveals that those who do good are few, while those who do evil are many.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Treasure of the Dao* states: \"Even those who ascend to the Heavenly Paradise may yet fall, while those who descend to the Hells may still rise.\" The Lord of the Fixed Record said: \"Yesterday, at the Eastern Flower Assembly, I gathered the various Lords of Destiny, along with the local spirits and divine administrators, to examine the worldly records. I found that among the people of the world, not one in fifty does good—how much less among the immortals? Among ten thousand, scarcely one or two. Yet even among these, many who had achieved merit later fell from their ranks. I fear that soon there will be no one left to inherit the registers of immortality. Moreover, the era of deliverance presses near, and the age of calamity grows ever more urgent. Though I have seen in the Purple Register of the Eastern Flower’s upper ledger those listed as the highest of the highest immortals, five have already fallen, and two have been demoted to earthly immortal offices. None remain to fill their places. Of the upper-middle immortals, twenty-eight in number, seven have fallen, two have been demoted to lower immortals, five have been reduced to the rank of mortals, and only one has been promoted. Of the upper and lower immortals, three hundred in number, twenty-six have fallen, eleven have been demoted to earthly overseers, and fifteen have been reduced to the rank of mortals. From this, we may infer that the offices of immortals lie vacant indeed, and suitable candidates are scarce.\n\nThere are also those in wandering appointments who, through indolence and neglect, fail to fulfill their duties. The highest immortals among them fall to the rank of lower immortals, while the lower immortals fall to become earthly overseers, that they may repent, cultivate diligently, and thereby regain their former positions. In former times, the Lady of the Supreme Prime, who had attained the rank of Primordial Lord, failed to attend diligently to the imperial bureau, neglected her proper duties, transgressed ritual propriety in her comings and goings, lost decorum in courtly feasts, and carelessly divulged heavenly treasures. She was demoted to the rank of lower immortal, her register as a Perfected Sovereign expunged, and her office in the Purple Void revoked. Thus, even those whose blessings have brought them to the Heavenly Paradise may yet fall.\n\nThose appointed as wandering灵官 in the Middle Prime’s Pure Tenuity may, over seven hundred years, advance in rank according to their conduct. Thus, even those whose misfortunes have brought them to the Hells may yet rise. Those who have been selected for immortal office must guard their station with utmost vigilance.\n\nAccording to the *Primordial Yang Jade Calendar*, every three generations a review is conducted. Those who have set their hearts on accumulating goodness and building merit, who are commended by the Three Realms and protected by the Five Emperors, and whose names are recorded in the heavens, shall be chosen—one hundred thousand to fulfill their duties. Additionally, another one hundred twenty thousand shall be selected to serve as reserve officials. Previously, this was called the *Primordial Yang Jade Casket*; here, it is termed the *Primordial Yang Jade Calendar*. The *Jade Casket* assesses the good and evil of deceased souls, while the *Jade Calendar* records merit. At the juncture when kalpic destinies intersect, those who are to assume office among the immortal bureaus shall be recorded in the *Jade Calendar*.\n\nThe \"three generations\" do not refer to the Three Dynasties of high antiquity, but rather to the Xia, Shang, and Zhou. *Zhuangzi* also states: \"From the Three Dynasties onward, how clamorous it has become!\" For clamor signifies the multiplication of affairs, which must then be managed. Those who set their hearts on accumulating goodness and merit need not fear the lack of protection from the Three Realms or the commendation of the Five Emperors. Yet goodness is not accumulated in a single day, nor does merit come in a single moment. Thus, those whose names are recorded in the heavens have long been destined in the unseen, to be commended in due time. If good and evil were not predetermined, how could one avoid even the slightest error?\n\nThe selection of an additional one hundred twenty thousand as reserve officials serves as a backup. After the offices of immortals lie vacant and their ranks remain sparse, further reserve officials are sought to supplement them—how urgently they are sought! Han Yu’s poem says: \"The upper realms abound with offices.\" Truly, there is reason for such words. In cases like these, some may rely on their names predestined in the *Mystic Chart*.\n\nWhen things of the same kind gather, beings of the same species separate—thus are the multitudes assessed, their merits and faults weighed. Could it be that their ranks are determined precisely by this principle of like gathering with like and species separating into groups?\n\nThose destined to receive deliverance number only two hundred forty thousand: one hundred thousand whose names are recorded in the heavens, and an additional one hundred twenty thousand selected separately. In such cases, the total must first be gathered by kind, then divided into groups for distinction.\n\nFor some, immortal bones alone suffice, without regard to hidden merit; for others, hidden merit exists, yet immortal bones are absent. The *Mystic Chart* of predestined names pertains to the method of cultivating the Great Cavern. As the *Scripture of the Jade Registers of the Three Origins* states: \"Only when the Mystic Luminance encircles the Upper Palace and the Five Talismans govern the Womb Honored One may one’s name be inscribed in the *Mystic Chart*.\" Examples include those like Master Sima of the Orthodox Unity, whose name is recorded in the Cinnabar Terrace.\n\nOthers attain transcendence through the harmony of their bones and appearance. Dragon rhinoceros and sun-marked brows are the marks of sages; river eyes and tortoise-shell patterns, the physiognomy of dukes and marquises. How could those whose bones and appearance align with immortality not be so?\n\nA back like the River Chariot, a chest bearing the recumbent bone, eyes with fourfold rings and inner purple radiance, a belly with white essence, purple qi in the brain and tongue, dark determination at the temples, red veins tracing the intestines, a square heaven and round earth in the forehead—all who possess such features are supreme immortals.\n\nThe *Inner Transmission of the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign* records the words of Perfected Jinglin to Huacun: \"Now I see your form, luminous as the dawn and clouds, your round eyes and double pupils illuminating your innate bones, your brain’s hue like precious radiance, your five viscera bound in purple networks, your heart inscribed with bright patterns. Thus does your form dwell in the auroral spirit, and your spirit receive the numinous essence. Such bone and appearance differ entirely from those who retreat in haste from the swift current.\"\n\nStill others achieve liberation through the turning wheel of karmic conditions. Those burdened by sin meet their end in death; those blessed by fortune attain *parinirvāṇa*.\n\nThose who have yet to fully attain the fruit of the Dao, though their blessings remain unexhausted, may first manifest a body of *parinirvāṇa*, thereafter to be transformed into immortals. In former times, Zheng Anren was born in the world of Chanli. At three days old, he could speak and already knew his past lives. By the age of twelve, his face radiated jade-like light. Forsaking the world and leaving behind worldly customs, he wandered far into the mountains and forests. When the time came for his *parinirvāṇa*, he died in the northern Rong lands of He, his corpse left exposed for over thirty years. Yet his form did not decay to ash. Only in the third year of the Red Brightness era, the year *bingwu*, did he at last attain the fruit of realization and receive the title *Cinnabar Spirit Venerable Lord*.\n\nSome achieve this through wholehearted devotion to the Three Treasures, their meritorious deeds piercing the heavens. To give life to heaven and earth, to make gods of ghosts and emperors of spirits—this is the Dao. And what is the Dao? It is the Three Treasures. Their merit blankets the world yet does not claim itself; they transform and bestow upon the ten thousand things yet do not rely on them. How could the Three Treasures, in their humility, seek human devotion? The scriptures say: \"To devote oneself to the scriptures of the Three Treasures yet not to the practices of the Three Treasures—those are they; we are we. What benefit is there in this?\" It further states: \"Merit piercing the heavens arises only from wholehearted devotion to the practices of the Three Treasures.\" Yet few realize that the Three Treasures are none other than one’s own true self. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"The Perfected One resides within you—why ask your neighbor?\" This is precisely where the ancients did not deceive their hearts.\n\nThe so-called Three Treasures are the conquest of greed, anger, and delusion. According to the *Scripture of the Inner Secret Treasury*: \"When the nature of nobility is quiescent and free from the dust of defilement, when precepts are unbroken—this is called the *Dharma Treasure*. When the nature of anger does not arise and one is not enraged by external dust, when concentration is free from birth and change—this is called the *Teacher Treasure*. When the nature of delusion does not grasp, when there is no vexation and no rest, when wisdom flows unimpeded—this is called the *Dao Treasure*.\" These Three Treasures are neither internal nor external, neither sound nor form. How could devotion to them be in vain? If greed, anger, and delusion are absent, then the Three Poisons are extinguished. Once the Three Poisons are destroyed, the Three Treasures appear before you. Meritorious deeds become manifest, and one’s faith is confirmed in piercing the heavens to become an immortal. Thus it is said: \"In delusion, one wanders the Three Realms; in awakening, one enters the Three Clarities.\"\n\nOthers are praised by the Three Officials for their veneration of the Teacher Treasure. There are Teachers of the Heavenly Treasure and Teachers of the Worldly Treasure. Together, they are called *Teachers*—the root. The virtue of life and growth depends on the kindness of parents and the guidance of teachers; without teachers, nothing is accomplished. In ancient times, scholars who encountered a worthy teacher were said to be \"reborn\"; without a worthy teacher, they were said to \"confound the scriptures.\" All who study the Dao rely on teachers for transmission. The teacher of Lord Lao was the Supreme Dao Lord; the teacher of the Supreme Dao Lord was the Primordial Beginning. Even the sages of precelestial origin required teachers—how much more so do ordinary people? Veneration means turning toward their gate, serving with diligence and enduring hardship without exception. Only then do the Three Officials praise them, recording their merit and movement, for they have not forgotten their root. The ancients bowed to trees to ascend as immortals and prostrated before mountains to attain the Dao. How could the Teacher Treasure not bring about accomplishment?\n\nStill others accumulate merit and resonance through fasting and upholding precepts. Fasting is the purification of the heart; precepts are the prevention of harm. There are two kinds of fasting: one for the ultimate Dao, the other for salvation. The ultimate Dao refers to those who, from the beginning to the end of their Dao-seeking, maintain fasting without retreat in every thought. This has two aspects: forgetting the heart and extinguishing the heart. Forgetting the heart means that from start to finish, one directs the mind, sitting and moving without attachment to form, as still as dead ashes, like withered wood, extinguishing appearances and thoughts until only the One remains. Extinguishing the heart means that with each arising thought, one forgets it, the spirit moving without hindrance, the mind returning to quiescence until reaching the Dao-field.\n\nSalvation refers to turning the heart toward the Dao, yearning for the mysterious and true, wishing to bestow blessings and wisdom to deliver all beings. One guards the body with precepts, preventing all afflictions from entering, so that body and mind are at peace and together enter the truth of the Dao. With long accumulation, one can move the Five Spirits. The scriptures say: \"Accumulated resonance leads to spiritual penetration.\" The *Scripture of Cave Mystery Precepts* states: \"Once there were twenty-six thousand Daoists who upheld fasting and precepts, their minds single and unwavering, cultivating in accord with the Dharma. After twelve years, the Earth Bureau recommended them, memorializing their names to the heavens. After a hundred years, they ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\"\n\nIn the Brahma-Pāramitā Heaven they now stand ranked as Perfected Ones—how could their accumulated virtue and resonant power deceive us?\n\nSome donate and disperse wealth and treasures to establish Dao halls. To possess surplus wealth is called “Dao ostentation”; to lack sufficient means is to become a thief. Both extremes miss the mean. Thus the humane and noble, when they have abundance, distribute it freely; when they have little, they practice frugality. How could Dao ostentation or thievery be other than wrong?\n\nEstablishing Dao halls means broadly constructing palaces and installing revered images to inspire devotion in people’s hearts.\n\nThere are three kinds of offering:\nFirst, the offering of Dharma;\nsecond, the offering of one’s person;\nthird, the offering of wealth.\n\nThe *Sutra of Karmic Retribution and Conditions* states: “The method of scattering offerings has two benefits: first, inner wealth does not arise; second, outer thieves do not appear. With inner and outer peace, all misfortunes dissolve.”\n\nThus the Dharma includes the offering of life, breaking through miserly hearts. The mysterious power of the sages penetrates unseen, and retribution follows merit.\n\nAs for establishing Dao halls, the *Sutra of the Wondrous Dharma’s Original Form* records: The Supreme Mystery Purple Void Perfected One was originally King Binling of the Black Mound Kingdom. After encountering the Heavenly Worthy expounding the *Sutra of the Wondrous Original Form*—the causes of the great celestial chaos—he awakened to his past life in the southern continent of Jambudvīpa, born in the land of Zhendan within the household of Ren Zizhi. There he constructed the Celestial Palace of Recruiting Worthies, with three tiers, thirty-six halls, seventy-two windowed immortal chambers, and one hundred twenty rooms, housing three hundred sixty Dao cultivators. He transcribed ten thousand scrolls of scriptures and ceaselessly provided them with fruit, food, clothing, and all manner of supplies. His merit, accumulated through unbroken generosity, has extended to his present existence.\n\nHaving ascended to the throne of the Black Mound Kingdom, he thereafter further cultivated the Dao of ascending as an immortal and attained the rank of the Mystery Purple Void Perfected One. Thus considered, if the act of bestowing alms upon Daoists yields such principle, how much greater must the merit be if one extends charity to the poor and destitute? Some rescue and relieve the impoverished, ferrying both celestial and mortal beings across suffering. Disparity between wealth and poverty is the nature of things, yet the mutual succor of rich and poor is the constant principle of the Way. Within a single village, there must be those who are wealthy, upon whom the poor rely for relief. If the rich are miserly and unkind, then why has Heaven made them wealthy? What use are they? This may be mirrored in the recent parable of the boatman who ferried grain across the river to transform the land.\n\nThe scripture states: *\"To rescue and relieve the destitute is to ferry celestial and mortal beings across suffering.\"* All people are children of Heaven; should they fall into misfortune and receive the grace of another’s aid, what greater act could there be? The *True Statutes and Decrees of the Most High* declares: *\"To save and relieve ten people unto life fulfills all vows, ensuring the protection of one’s family across the rivers of existence. If such kindness extends for ten years or more, the entire household shall attain immortal longevity.\"* The term \"ferrying across\" signifies that one’s virtue is weighty—those in destitution rely upon it for survival, just as the earth bears all things and a boat ferries people to safety.\n\nIn former times, Xu Ying studied the Dao upon Red Mountain. Before his cultivation was complete, the Left Minister of the Three Offices dispatched the Registrar Hou Fang and the Enforcer of Transgressions Yan Baihu to Red Mountain, where they seized Ying and prepared to interrogate him for his crimes. Fortunately, a divine messenger hastened to inform the Controller of Destinies, who immediately sent the Central Attendant Li Zun, wielding a fire-bell, to rebuke and disperse them. Thus, Fang and Baihu fled in disarray. Before Li Zun’s arrival, Ying had been seized with terror, his qi nearly depleted. He also relied upon Gong Chujie and Li Kailin to assist in his defense, narrowly averting disaster. Fang’s accusations were not without basis, yet Ying’s responses were precise.\n\nThe Three Offices produced a red tablet, a sin tablet, and a ledger of transgressions, questioning Ying: *\"One who aspires to study the Dao and emulate the immortals, who holds the profound heart of the mysterious and reveres the lofty spirits, ought to have accumulated worldly merit, avoided calamity, and allowed virtue to take root in the unseen, with seven generations of blessings ascending to the heavens—only then may one ascend as a Perfected One of the Pristine and Pure and cross into the Clear Mansion. Yet you, with your own hands, slew Xie Gong, disrupting the harmony of the Three Luminaries. You beheaded Li Qi to substitute for Cai Zhi’s execution, slaughtered She Fanmu and others, dismembered Cao Biao of the Bell Chamber, drowned Tang Yun’s corpse in talismanic water, burned Xu Ang’s remains, strangled Huan Zheng, and butchered Zhen Qiang—forty-three acts of cruelty, violence, and indiscriminate punishment. Your litany of grievances has reached the Celestial Emperor, your transgressions piled high as mountains, while not a single good deed stands to your name. Moreover, you originally followed the Way of the Silk Clan, consuming the blood and flesh of living beings, hastening to repay your karmic debts, your name already recorded in the registers of the Three Offices. Yet you transgressed the proper order, pledging yourself to the true qi, with father and son in the same household each serving different masters, living in discord and refusing to share in the libations—your offenses are grave, and the unseen judgment is already being meted out. With such accumulated sins, how could there be immortality for you? How dare you deceive the courts of the Most High and inscribe your name in the Purple Register of the Undying?\"*\n\nYing replied: *\"The Dao of Heaven is impartial, favoring only the good. Heaven and Earth are without intent, yet they show compassion to those of virtue. Thus, when the Ban Spring flowed with blood, it did not hinder the dragon’s majestic rise; when the Three Miao dyed the fields red at Zhuolu, did it obstruct the divine transformations of the great sages? My ancestor of ten generations past, Xu Zi’a, accumulated benevolence and manifested virtue, extending his kindness even to birds and beasts. In years of famine and plague, when the people starved and disease raged, leaving barely one in a hundred alive, Zi’a’s family possessed vast wealth. He personally prepared medicinal remedies, tirelessly aiding those beyond his household. At the death of others, he grieved as if losing his own kin; in the suffering of others, he agonized as if afflicted himself. Lives on the brink of death were saved by his hands, and in years of dire poverty, he nurtured the destitute as his own children. Four hundred and eight people survived the famine by his grace. His benevolence and virtue were such that they were destined to descend upon us, inscribing his merit in the records of the Celestial Emperor and carving his name upon the sacred tablets. Five of us were born with an affinity for immortality, three have already ascended, and our names are inscribed in the Azure Palace of the Most High upon the bound jade tablets—how could the likes of you presume to interfere?\"*\n\nExamining Xu Ying’s past lives, his good and evil deeds were evenly matched at fifteen each. Yet by virtue of Zi’a’s accumulated benevolence and manifested virtue, he was delivered from the pursuit of the Three Offices, nearly escaping the jaws of disaster. Thereafter, his name was recorded in the Eastern Palace, and his goodness was sufficient to outweigh his transgressions. Alas! A single good deed within a person can eradicate a hundred evils—this is no empty saying.\n\nSome become the Three Masters, their merit complete and their names recorded in the celestial registers. The master who transmits the scriptures is called the *Ferrying Master*; the master of the Ferrying Master is called the *Register Master*; and the master of the Register Master is called the *Scripture Master*—these are the Three Masters. They are the great ancestral teachers of past ages, the spiritual parents of later generations. If one upholds and propagates the true teaching, widely establishes fields of merit, transforms and ferries sentient beings, and continues the lineage of the sacred flame, cherishing their memory as if standing before their ancestral temple—this is truly the accomplishment of merit.\n\nThough the Three Masters may have passed into the distant past, their virtuous influence endures unbroken, perpetuated by later generations. The Supreme Ultimate Void Perfected One asked the Most High Lord Lao: *\"Formerly, I received the sacred teaching, which exhorted men and women to diligently cultivate merit. I am unsure what constitutes merit.\"* The Most High Lord Lao replied: *\"Exerting oneself in virtuous action is called *merit*; when merit extends to others, it is called *virtue*. If one’s merit is complete, one’s name will be recorded in the celestial registers—this is certain.\"*\n\nIn former times, Xie Chongji was a Daoist of Mount Hua. He had no other merit but the practice of burning incense, offering three hundred censers each day without fail.\n\nOn the second day of the third month in the first year of the Liang Kaiping era, two azure lads descended to welcome him away—this was proof of his merit’s fulfillment.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Masters referred only to the Masters of Scriptures, Registers, and Ordination. The *Jade Registers Scripture* clearly preserves the methods of the Three Masters, which former worthies regarded as the established model. Later, during the time of Chao Shibin, two more were added to make Five Masters—this was merely a division of roles. The *Compendium of Fixed Regulations* includes the Master of the Mysterious Center and the Master of Ritual Supervision, yet it remains unclear whether these two are one and the same. They speak of \"two fives making ten,\" unaware that \"five fives also make ten.\"\n\nExamining the ledgers of the Three Offices, all records correspond in reverse to the Seed People, with distinctions between high and low, not a hairbreadth overlooked. The Three Primes have Three Offices, divided into Nine Offices, comprising twenty-seven bureaus and one hundred twenty departments. The left, Yang Office of Life records those with merit in its green ledgers; the right, Yin Office of Death records those with transgressions in its black ledgers. If within transgression there is merit, or within merit there is transgression, they are not confined to a single department. Thus, the facts are verified.\n\nThere are triennial reviews, nine-year reviews, and twenty-four-year reviews. When the Three Offices concur, their records of merit and transgression align with those of the Three Bureaus, with no discrepancy before or after, and only then are they submitted for imperial consideration. As for the reverse registration of the Seed People, it was particularly implemented after the Kaihuang era, extending to the Jia-Shen year, when the official ranks were insufficient. Thus, an additional one hundred twenty thousand were selected as reserve officials. The quota for the Seed People was not yet filled, so even those whose merit was incomplete were allowed to enter their number, termed \"reverse registration.\"\n\nThe *Eightfold Pure True Scripture* states: Those who practice the methods of the sun and moon and attain the Dao are all reverse-registered in the Azure Office before their birth, for the Great Dao’s gate of advancement rewards the good and pities the incapable. Even those whose goodness is not yet mature are still advanced; those whose goodness is immature are still pitied.\n\nMoreover, the Nine Dark Prisons received the Nine Dragon Talisman Mandate from the Eastern Azure Palace, commanding the release of the male and female souls of the dead whose names are recorded in the Jade Caskets of the Nine Darks, whose accumulated merit and virtue are complete and who are due for deliverance. Thirty-two thousand were selected to replenish the ranks after the Jia-Shen purgation, becoming the people of the Great Possession.\n\nThe Northern Capital of Fengdu is governed by the Celestial Office; the Springs of Qu and the Sources of He are governed by the Aquatic Office; the Nine Dark Hells are governed by the Terrestrial Office. Though the Nine Darks are the greatest of transgressions, there should be none eligible for deliverance. Yet during the Jia-Shen cataclysm, when the purgation was carried out, the dead were annihilated without exception. Thus, the Eastern Azure Palace issued another Nine Dragon Talisman Mandate to open the Nine Dark Prisons and select souls of merit.\n\nThe Eastern Azure Palace, according to the *Scripture of Yellow Qi and Yang Essence*, is the Cavern Yang of Fusang. Those who enter this palace become flying immortals. The *Luminous Writ of the Grand Empyrean* states: All who possess the body of the Four Poles’ Bright Statutes and the names listed by the Four Directors and Five Thearchs are recorded in the Azure Palace above. Thus, the Eastern Azure is known to preside over the Registers of Life.\n\nThe people of the Great Possession are called the Reborn. Therefore, the *Upper Scripture of Purple Text* says: They traverse the Three Calamities unharmed. It also says: They must witness rebirth in the Great Peace. Thus, the Great Peace is undoubtedly the Great Possession.\n\nAt this time, life and death converge, good and evil are judged, and those who pass through truly find joy. No joy surpasses longevity, yet knowing life is joyous, they do not cultivate it. No sorrow surpasses death, yet knowing death is sorrowful, they do not avoid it. It is not that life is distant from people; people distance themselves from life. The good are the threads of heaven and earth; the evil are the thieves of heaven and earth. The good are the foundation of cultivating life.\n\nShun began as a commoner, relinquishing self to follow others in goodness. Through true accumulation and prolonged effort, he reigned over the world, later ascending to immortality and attaining the rank of Supreme Ultimate Perfected One. Thus, it is known that goodness brings joy. Precisely at the convergence of life and death, when good and evil are judged, without merit as one’s credential, one cannot escape the dissolution of the body and the suffering of the bitter sea.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of the Assembly of All Truths said: \"To and fro within the Three Paths, truly by one’s own bitter toil.\" Is this not cause for great lament? Yet the Three Offices are exacting, their documents profuse. The Dragon Gate receives the assembly, the Bird Mother supervises the immortals, the ten thousand sages manifest their presence day and night without pause, weighing merit and transgression equally, ensuring no bias in life and death. This confusion and clamor are also my concern.\n\nThe great reckoning is imminent, and in every matter, there are omissions. I constantly fear that one day I may be ensnared in the public tribunal. Those who possess the world worry for the world; those who possess only themselves worry for themselves. Though the world and the self differ in what they worry over, their worry is the same. The flying celestial beings who govern life and death bear even greater worry than the world.\n\nAt the Jia-Shen reckoning, those with merit are promoted, and those with transgression are punished. Moreover, the ten thousand sages manifest in the vastness of the heavens, ensuring the equal weighing of merit and transgression. There should be no worry, yet it is said this confusion and clamor are also my concern. What I worry over is that the good may not be fully recognized, the evil may not be fully exposed, and public justice may be compromised—hence the term \"confusion and clamor.\" I constantly fear that one day I may be ensnared in the public tribunal.\n\nFurthermore, the Three Offices are exacting, their documents profuse—this refers to the multitude of records. The Dragon Gate receiving the assembly and the Bird Mother supervising the immortals refer to the great flood. The *Master Huainan* states: Before the Dragon Gate was opened and Lüliang was carved, the Yellow River issued from above Meng Gate, flooding in reverse, submerging all hills and mounds—this was called the Great Flood. According to the *Water Classic*, the Dragon Gate is in Yi County of Hedong, which is the \"leading the river from the accumulated stones to the Dragon Gate\" mentioned in the *Book of Documents*.\n\nYet the Dragon Gate is indeed the confluence where the world’s river sources gather. The jia-shen year marks the appointed time of the great flood, when the waters of the four seas first assemble here, fixed to the day of the kalpic cycle, before the deluge swells to engulf heaven and earth, sparing neither high nor low.\n\nAt that time, the goodly seed-people who escape the flood are those whom the Bird Mother, a spirit of the waters, bears aloft in a phoenix chariot to the slopes of Kunlun. Thus the *Scripture of the Five Elders for Averting the Great Kalpa* states: “The nine rivers receive their reckoning; the flood surges through the streams; the Water Mother lingers; bird and steed gather in flocks.” The Lady of Supreme Perfection also speaks of “the eight qi steaming over mountains and marshes, the shifting sands damming the source-mouths.” Thereupon the four seas converge, the dragon hosts dance, and in the jia-shen year the dark flood will soar and flow backward. Every affair is neglected and in disarray—as the *Scripture of the Seventy-Four Methods* says, “Matters remain untouched, yet the turning of fate has its proper cause; still, they must be carried out.” Wherever one turns, matters press yet remain unaddressed; only the kalpic flood is cause for dread.\n\nI have heard that the Heavenly Worthy, in creating a transformation of great compassion, takes pity on the teeming masses and opens the mysteries of the Nine Heavens to succor the myriad people. The luminous statutes contain prohibitions and precepts, which a humble servant such as I may not presume to hear in full. Yet the great reckoning has its appointed time, and the jia-shen year draws near its close; the movement of fate is swift and urgent, and the great Dharma should be put into practice. The *Scripture of Jade Purity* teaches four methods of cultivation, with compassion foremost. The *Hidden Book of Jade Purity* lists nine traces of the master, with great compassion as the first. “I possess three treasures,” it is said, “and the first is compassion.” Thus we know that compassion is not the sole possession of sages—all people possess it. Only the sage first attains the rectitude of my heart, expands and fulfills it, so that it pervades all things, and there is nothing that does not rely on its grace.\n\nNow, as the jia-shen year nears its end, it is precisely the time when the great Dharma should be practiced. If we set aside compassion and fail to broaden it, how can we save each and every person? The luminous statutes contain prohibitions and precepts, stating that the statutes of the Luminous Perfected have six time limits for transmission: first, once every forty thousand kalpas; second, once every forty thousand years; third, once every four thousand years; fourth, once every four hundred years; fifth, once every forty years; sixth, once every four cycles. When the kalpic cycle reaches its end, the Dharma may be transmitted to one person. Yet the movement of fate is swift and the hour urgent; with great compassion and broad salvation, the Dharma is transmitted upon encountering the worthy, without regard to fixed numbers. Thus those of sincere heart may, within the reckoning of calculations, hear the sound of the Dharma, have it revealed to their sight and hearing, and be exhorted and transformed before they awaken.\n\nFearing to offend the celestial countenance with these supplications above, I humbly beseech your compassion and grant me what I have yet to hear.\n\nThe elders once said: \"With intent, one may attain the Dao; yet without intent, one may attain it more readily.\" These two lines have been expounded in myriad ways, yet none have made them clear. In my foolish view, how could one attain the Dao without intent? If one were without intent, how would one differ from wood or stone?\n\nThose who study the Dao need only prepare the heart to receive it—whether they gain it or lose it, they leave it to its own course. What is called \"without intent\" means without *this* intent. As soon as one’s heart is bound to gain or loss, the heart is no longer single-minded. If the heart is not single-minded, even a hundred artisans in their workshops may achieve their craft, but in the Dao, how distant they remain!\n\nNow, the scripture’s purport is that those with intent draw near to cultivating goodness, yet without beholding the Dharma-gate, they cannot enter, though they strive. Though they have ears and eyes to hear and see, none of it is real; they practice without attachment, habituate without discernment. Were it not for revelation to their sight and hearing, exhortation to awaken and enter, they would spend their lives following it without knowing—such are the many.\n\nThus, the Flying Celestial Divine King, undeterred by the transgression of offending heaven, within the reckoning of calculations, enables those with intent to escape the great calamity of the kalpic cycle. Is not his intent vast indeed?\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy stroked the table, raised his voice in lofty resolve, composed his spirit in distant contemplation, and intoned the Cavernous Chapters, chanting their jade-like resonance. After a long while, he suddenly sighed and said: \"The supreme model is empty and silent, its principle subtle and profoundly obscure; the Dao reaches the double mystery, its qi crowns the Divine Empyrean. Its utmost is difficult to express, its wonder difficult to surpass.\"\n\nBefore the Flying Celestial Divine King entreated the *Jade Chapters of Spirit-Generation*, the Heavenly Worthy first sighed, saying the Dao’s methods are lofty and wondrous, not to be attained in haste. Thus, he stroked the table—this gesture showed a willingness to engage below—while raising his voice in lofty resolve, as if to suggest that the profound could not be fully plumbed. Composing his spirit in distant contemplation, he intoned the Cavernous Chapters, chanting their jade-like resonance.\n\nThis entire passage relies on the Shangqing transformative *Scripture of the Seventy-Four Methods*. When the Lord of Longevity and Controller of Destiny entreated the *Scripture of the Seventy-Four Methods*, he first declared: \"Though my affairs are unworthy, fate has its good reasons. To encounter the Heavenly Worthy is the fortune of a lifetime. I know not what to say; I humbly beseech your compassion and grant me perfection in the real.\" Thereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy stroked the table, raised his voice to the great void, and after a long while, showed a willingness to engage below. The wording of the inquiry differs slightly, but the principle is largely the same.\n\nComposing the spirit prevents the arising of afflictions; distant contemplation allows the heart to wander in the harmony of primordial virtue. The *Cavernous Chapters* are the great cavern’s verses. \"Chanting their jade-like resonance\" describes the sound’s reverberation. After long entreaty, he lamented: \"The supreme model is empty and silent, its principle subtle and profoundly obscure; the Dao reaches the double mystery, its qi crowns the Divine Empyrean.\" This refers to the *Scripture of Spirit-Generation*.\n\nYet the *Chapters of Spirit-Generation* are the numinous script formed by the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery. Its model is empty and vast, its principles remote and profound; its Dao truly crowns the double mystery, its qi originates from the Divine Empyrean. Though the kalpic cycle nears its end and the scripture should be proclaimed to the world, revealing it to sight and hearing, exhorting the unawakened, its purport is most ultimate and wondrous—beyond the reach of lesser immortals and inferior adepts. Thus, it is said: \"Its utmost is difficult to express, its wonder difficult to surpass.\" These two lines sigh for the preceding text.\n\nThe Divine Empyrean is one of the Nine Heavens. This differs from the Nine Empyreans in the *Rites of the Divine Empyrean* of recent times and the *Biographies of Guest Immortals*; those with discernment will know this for themselves.\n\n\"Since you hold the imperial office, bearing the charge of Divine King, your wings of flight soar through the jade towers, the Four Ministers assist the luminous wheel. Your gaze extends to the farthest reaches, governing the boundless; you harmonize the myriad transformations, tending to the multitudes of the living.\"\n\n\"Since you hold the imperial office\"—this refers to the Divine King, as spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. In the earlier passage, the Divine King himself said, \"Your humble servant has had the fortune to attend your numinous chariot.\" Now to address him as holding the imperial office—is this not an advancement beyond his station?\n\nSince the teachings of Great Peace were bestowed, affairs have multiplied beyond those of the Three Dynasties. Thus, he is called the Later Sage and Imperial Lord, and not for a single reason. A great mansion is not supported by a single timber; the world is not governed by one man—how much more so the onerous affairs of the Three Realms’ life and death?\n\nThe Flying Celestial Divine King holds the rank of Divine King and the office of Emperor. Thus, the scripture says: \"He governs life and death, encompasses the celestial immortals, oversees the Seven Awakenings, and gazes into distant lands.\" From this, we see that he is called Divine King for his unfathomable nature, Emperor for his governance of life and death—Divine and Emperor are, in truth, one.\n\n\"Your wings of flight soar through the jade towers, the Four Ministers assist the luminous wheel.\" This speaks of the Flying Celestial Divine King, who constantly traverses the Three Realms, governing ghosts and spirits. When one merit is achieved and goodness advanced, his virtue and deeds truly equal those of the Later Sage, thus he assists in the jade towers.\n\nAccording to the *Commentary on the Thirty-Nine Sections*, the Jade Tower is in the Palace of Supreme Tenuity, the celestial emperor’s jade abode. The sun and moon of the heavens are true essence; the sun and moon of the caverns are hidden roots; the sun and moon of the human realm are the luminous wheel, and those who consume the luminous wheel become immortals. Now, the Divine King not only equals the Later Sage in merit but also assists those who study immortality—thus, it is said the Four Ministers assist the luminous wheel.\n\nAs for \"harmonizing the myriad transformations, tending to the multitudes of the living, gazing into the farthest reaches\"—we know the Flying Celestial Divine King governs affairs beyond a single domain.\n\nNow, the great cycle has begun its appointed time; the Three and Five announce the hour; the Hundred and Six respond to the mechanism; the Yang Nine stirs and surges. The vast springs churn waves; myriad calamities assail the heavens. The Four Offices select and appoint to replenish the seed people. The Three Dynasties are plunged into chaos; good and evil must be distinguished. You must labor for the multitudes, wearying yourself for the Three Offices. At this juncture of rise and fall, affairs demand the capable.\n\nNow, I entrust this to you—strive with diligence.\n\nAs previously stated, the great cycle nears its appointed end, its reckoning concluding in the *jiashen* year. Today, the great cycle has begun its appointed time; the Three and Five announce the hour. The phrase \"the great cycle has begun its appointed time\" may refer to the era of Yao, when the *jiashen* year drew to a close amid the calamity of the Great Flood. \"The Three and Five announce the hour\" may signify the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. Such are the words handed down through tradition, though they are not recorded in the scriptures.\n\nMoreover, the *Purple Texts of the Upper Canon* states: \"In the years following the Tang, the accumulated reckoning reaches forty-six. At the close of *dinghai*, amid the interval before and after, in the twentieth year of the Horse, the mandate of the state shall be twice exhausted. East and West shall contend for hegemony to uphold the sovereign, giving rise to the names of the Nine and the One.\" Furthermore, the son of the Round-Eyed Sun Mirror, who establishes his reign and extends the radiance of peace, or the descendants of Changyuan in the *jiashen* year—such words approach the enigmatic language of the *geng* oracles, making their truth difficult to ascertain. Others interpret the Three and Five as the convergence of yin and yang in the cyclical flow of *qi*, yet no single explanation prevails.\n\nIf we turn to the *Upper Canon of the Phoenix Terrace and Plain Silk*, it is said:\n*\"The great kalpa reaches its destined end,\nAs the cycles of the Two Images incline.\nThe Dragon Gate severs, the Celestial River runs dry,\nThe Three and Five turn against one another in strife.\"*\nThis, as an explanation of yin and yang, seems closer to the mark.\n\nThe *Hundred and Six* refers to the cycle of great floods. Thus, \"the Hundred and Six respond to the mechanism, the Yang Nine stirs and surges, the vast springs churn waves, myriad calamities assail the heavens.\" If the Hundred and Six signifies flood disasters, and below it speaks of \"the vast springs churn waves,\" while between them it mentions \"the Yang Nine stirs and surges,\" what is the reason?\n\nThe Lady of Supreme Perfection, Wang, states: \"The Yang Nine brings great drought, the seas surge while the land scorches. The Hundred and Six dries the seas, and the valleys fill of their own accord.\" If it is a flood disaster, the waters must first gather at the mouths of the Nine Rivers, converging at their appointed time before overflowing, thus causing the seas to recede. From this, the surging of the seas in the Yang Nine is also evident. Some say: the seas recede only when the yang *qi* excites them, hence it is called \"the Yang Nine stirs and surges.\"\n\nThe Four Offices are: for men, Tongchu and Xiaoxian; for women, Yiqian and Hanzhen. These four offices are governed by the Huayang region of Mount Tong. \"You must labor for the multitudes, wearying yourself for the Three Offices\"—this aligns with the *Immortals’ Tales of Yongcheng*, which states: \"The Three Heavens gleam in their oversight, while the Bureau of Yin wearies in its investigations.\" The rise and fall refer to the great cycle beginning its appointed time, the *jiashen* year drawing to a close. It is precisely at this moment that one must exert effort to ensure the clear distinction between good and evil. Now, with this commission, strive with diligence.\n\nThe treasured scriptures are wondrous and weighty, the numinous sounds of the Nine Heavens, bestowed upon the exalted sages, not to be heard by ghosts or spirits. The standards of the Illuminated Perfected are set, transmitted but once in forty thousand kalpas. Now, in defiance of the prohibitions, I pass this to you—guard it well, and take care not to transmit it lightly.\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating Spirits* was originally the chapter bestowed by the Most High Jade Emperor of Primordial Beginning, received from the natural order. Those who study its verses ascend at once to the rank of Perfected Sovereign. Its mysteries are profound and weighty, like the heights of the Nine Heavens—this is the meaning of its wonder and the difficulty of transcending it. The divine chapters are the *qi* of soaring mystery, their sounds formed through three harmonies, hence they are called the \"numinous sounds\" and the \"standards of the Illuminated Perfected,\" as explained earlier.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy bestowed this upon the Flying Celestial Divine King—could it be that master and disciple were unworthy of such a transmission? Yet it speaks of defying prohibitions in passing it on; in the exchange of receiving and bestowing, can one not be reverent?\n\nThe Celestial Marshal of the Nine Heavens, the Jade Gentleman Attendant of Immortals, opened the cloud-brocade satchel of the Purple Yang Jade Slips and brought forth the *Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating Spirits*. The Four Assistants took their positions, the Five Elders oversaw the Perfected, the Great One commanded the hour, and the Jade Emperor intoned the covenant. All followed the rites of the *Illuminated Perfected Compendium*, facing south in prostration to bestow it upon the Flying Celestial Divine King of the Infinite. When the ritual was complete, the hosts of heaven returned to their stations.\n\nThe name of the Celestial Marshal appears frequently in the scriptures. It is also said to be the Jade Gentleman Attendant of Immortals, an official in charge of the canon. The *Hidden Decisions* states that the Nine Palaces of Jade Clarity, Highest Clarity, Supreme Ultimate, and Great Clarity each have their own officials and attendants. The *Exegesis of the Wondrous Canon of the Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating Spirits* mentions dukes, marquises, and ministers—these must refer to the officials of the Jade Clarity Palace.\n\nThe Purple Yang Jade Slips are contained in a cloud-brocade satchel. There are also the Jade Slips of Yulin and the cloud-brocade satchels. The Purple Yang is the repository of the scriptures, while the cloud-brocade is the satchel that holds them. Formerly, the Great Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate bestowed the *Scripture of Divine Radiance and Mystic Transformation* upon the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, wrapping it once in a cloud-brocade satchel. The Central Yellow Supreme Emperor of the Great One bestowed the *Twelve Scrolls of the Nine Vermilion Talismans* upon the Lord of Longevity and Controller of Destinies of the Southern Culmen, also sealing them in a cloud-brocade satchel.\n\nThe Four Assistants took their positions, the Five Elders oversaw the Perfected, the Great One commanded the hour, and the Jade Emperor intoned the covenant. Taking their positions establishes hierarchy; overseeing the Perfected encompasses their numbers; commanding the hour selects the proper day and time; intoning the covenant is to take oaths binding the Three Realms. The *Inner Scripture of the Perfected of the Five Emperors* states: \"Without a covenant, there is no transmission; without proper exchange, both giver and receiver lose their authenticity. The responsibility for life and death lies in adhering to the text and upholding it.\"\n\nIf we consider this in terms of the individual, the Four Assistants are the spirits of the two hands and two feet. The Five Elders are: the first, Baiyuan; the second, Wuying; the third, Taojun; the fourth, Siming; and the fifth, Taiyi—these are the Five Elders. Taiyi is the spirit of the womb and embryo, while the Jade Emperor is the spirit within the Muddy Pellet. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: \"The peak within heaven is reverently cultivated; when the numinous dwelling is purified, the Jade Emperor roams therein.\"\n\nIf we consider the domain over which the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy presides, the Four Assistants are the Left Assistant, Right Assistant, Front Counselor, and Rear Minister. The Five Elders are: the Elder of the Vast Ultimate of Jade Clarity, the Elder of the Numinous Radiance of the Empty Sovereign, the Elder of the Treasure Heaven of Mystic Florescence, the Elder of the Grand Numinosity of Luminous Subtlety, and the Elder of the Vast Capital of Sha Yu—these are the Five Elders. Taiyi is the Central Yellow Taiyi, and the Jade Emperor is the Most High Jade Emperor.\n\nThe practice of bowing and rising is the proper decorum for transmitting scriptures. Within the Three Yuan Offices, the protocols for bowing and rising encompass two thousand four hundred rules. Since the Dragon Han era, these have sunk into chaos, their texts altered and incomplete. By the first year of the Red Clarity epoch, the Supreme Sages collated them, leaving only two hundred forty rules. Facing south in a long kneel is the method prescribed in the *Three Yuan Precepts and Prohibitions*. The south is the life-generating direction of the Left Office. Transmitting the Dao to disciples follows this principle of facing the source of life.\n\nThe Perfected One of Western Citadel states: \"Those who study the Dao must not act in haste; those who seek immortality must not rush precipitously.\" When one examines the transmission of the *Scripture of Generating the Spirit*, with its many stages and sequences, one understands why the Yellow Emperor traversed a full cycle, studied under over eighty masters, and received more than three thousand teachings—yet still did not behold the Mystery’s gate. Truly, there is reason for this.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy solemnly addressed the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings: \"These nine heavens’ chapters are the flying mystery-qi of the Three Caverns, formed into sound through three assemblies, coalescing into true script, blending the hundred spirits and concealing their inner names in hidden rhymes.\" Thus, the Great One tests and observes, gathering life from the ten directions, leading them to assemble in the Cavernous Void, and initiating oaths in cinnabar and azure. The Heavenly Worthy again addressed the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings: \"These nine heavens’ chapters are the flying mystery-qi of the Three Caverns, formed into sound through three assemblies, coalescing into true script, blending the hundred spirits and concealing their inner names in hidden rhymes.\" This indicates the profound secrecy of this scripture, as previously explained.\n\nThe reason for its secrecy is that the spirit of the Great One is always entrusted to test and observe in the human realm. If the test is passed, one must then initiate an oath before transmission may proceed. The matter of testing is carefully recorded in the *Essential and Wondrous Ready-Made Formulae*: \"In the past, when I received the divine scriptures, someone tested me by striking my hand with a staff until it bled. Yet I still turned my heart toward them, my thoughts untainted by other intentions—this was passing the test.\" The scriptural method includes a trial of commitment: before receiving the transmission, one’s clothes may be set aflame without cause, and though they burn away, one must not speak. Even so, no base or ugly qi should manifest outwardly, nor should any malicious words issue from the mouth—only then is the test passed.\n\nIn many versions, the character for \"test\" is mistakenly written as \"prohibition,\" obscuring the meaning. The *Scripture of the Golden Mystery Feathered Chapters* records the method of transmission: the Five Elders confer the charts, and the Great One tests and observes. Thus, one gathers life from the ten directions and leads them to assemble in the Cavern Heavens. The *Hidden Writ of Jade Clarity* also states: \"The Lord Emperor encompasses all heavens and tests the ten directions.\" This confirms that \"test\" was mistakenly written as \"prohibition.\"\n\nThe *Golden Mystery Feathered Chapters* further states: \"Gathering life from the ten directions and leading them to assemble in the Cavernous Void—what does this mean?\" Among the Six Caverns, the Cavernous Void corresponds to the west. Now, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy commands the Great One to gather life from the ten directions, a phrase that also encompasses the registers of the dead. Thus, it is said to lead them to assemble in the Cavernous Void, as the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings govern both life and death.\n\nInitiating oaths in cinnabar and azure involves smearing blood as cinnabar and silk as azure, both serving as tokens of sincerity and trust. For example, in the *Immortals’ Method of the Supreme Ultimate Azure Essence and Dry Stone Nourishment*, the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One, who received it from the Three Yuan Lord of Primordial Simplicity, still spoke of initiating oaths in golden azure. How much more so for the *Jade Chapters of Generating the Spirit*, which are the Primordial Beginning’s forbidden scriptures?\n\nWithout causes and conditions accumulated over countless kalpas, and without one’s name pre-recorded in the Emperor’s charts, one cannot even glimpse these texts. If one is deemed worthy to behold their contents, nine generations of ancestors ascend together as immortals. One must carefully select those destined for immortality, observe a thousand days of pure fasting over seven hundred years, present gold and silk, and swear an oath in accordance with the covenant before transmitting the scripture. If one is cautious, blessings will follow; if one leaks the teachings, calamity will arrive. Blessings extend to nine generations of ancestors, their virtue as weighty as mountains and seas. Calamity brings punishment that flows for countless kalpas, more agonizing than boiling poison, more excruciating than the wind’s blade—how can one not be cautious?\n\nThe retribution of causes and conditions is like the work of planting: if one cultivates carelessly, the harvest will be careless; if one sows haphazardly, the yield will be haphazard. Causes and conditions over countless kalpas are not accumulated in a single day, and thus the practitioner of the Dao does not achieve perfection in one lifetime. When Lord Xu ascended, the Emperor’s edict proclaimed: \"Since many kalpas ago, you have diligently cultivated the Supreme Dao, studying all methods and a thousand gates without fail.\" Thus, those whose names are recorded in the Emperor’s charts—how could it be otherwise?\n\nFor the practitioner of the Dao to behold the contents of these texts, there must be predestined affinity. As the *Inner Scripture of the Five Emperors* states: \"Those who attain the Dao but lack immortal bones will have their jade names inscribed in the books, yet in their next life, they will not behold these texts. Those who obtain the scriptures become the patriarchs of the Five Marchmounts.\" Here, it is said that beholding the texts allows nine generations of ancestors to ascend together as immortals—how does this differ from the former? However, the methods of the Great Cavern first resolve the karmic knots of the underworld, hence the reference to nine generations, which slightly differs from the *Inner Scripture of the Five Emperors*.\n\nThe *Jade Formulae of the Great Cavern Scripture* also states: \"Dissolving the hundred knots of seven generations of ancestors, they depart with the wind, roots severed, their foundations shifted, entering the Mystery through transformation.\" What cultivation could be greater than this? Thus, the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* and the *Chapters of Generating the Spirit* follow different paths to the same destination.\n\nPractitioners of the Dao, before their own merits are complete, must first eliminate their names from the ghostly registers. When transmitting the teachings, one must select those with immortal bones to receive them. Over seven hundred years, one observes a thousand days of pure fasting. This refers to the time limit for transmitting scriptures. For example, the Heavenly King of Primordial Beginning conferred the *Seventy-Four Methods Scripture* upon the Lord of Longevity and Controller of Destinies of the Southern Culmen, saying: \"After you fast for seven hundred years, you shall receive these three scriptures.\" The Heavenly Venerable of Primordial Beginning received the *Inner Scripture* from Master Hongya, opening it once every nine thousand years. Thus, seven and nine are yang numbers. One fasts with gold and silk, swears an oath in accordance with the covenant, and transmits the teachings.\n\nAccording to the *Three Primal Precepts of Retribution*: \"Offering wealth corresponds to the heart; extending the heart corresponds to wealth. Their merit is equal.\" The ancients sought the heart, while the degenerate age seeks wealth. The ancients transmitted nothing without the heart; the degenerate age delivers nothing without wealth.\n\n\"Gold and silk for the oath of the heart\": gold is chosen for its hardness and firmness, while silk substitutes for the cutting of hair. Throughout this scripture, warnings and covenants are reiterated. At the outset, it states: \"Whoever steals this shall suffer the Wind Blade for ten thousand kalpas, their soul perishing without rebirth.\" Later, it admonishes: \"Guard your heart and uphold this teaching; take care not to leak it lightly, lest the Wind Blade examine your body.\" Here, it declares: \"Be vigilant, and you shall enjoy blessings; leak it, and calamity shall arrive, even to the point of the Wind Blade’s punishment.\" How could one not be vigilant?\n\n*The Exegesis on the Jade Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Nine Heavens Generative Spirit*, Middle Scroll, concludes.\n\n---\n\n*The Exegesis on the Jade Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Nine Heavens Generative Spirit*, Lower Scroll\nCommentary by Wang Xichao, Recluse of the Hidden Worth, Daoist of Chongxu Abbey in Mianzhou\n\n**First Chapter: The Generative Spirit of the Boundless Heaven of Utmost Joy**\n\nThe nine heavens of this chapter differ from those in the *Central Record of Embryonic Essence*. From the Boundless Heaven of Utmost Joy to the seventh, the Heaven of Parinirmita-vaśavartin; the eighth, the Heaven of Brahmā-kāyika; and the ninth, the Heaven of Brahma-pāriṣadya—these nine heavens, when augmented by three additional heavens, form the twelve heavens of the Celestial Emperors, the ancestors of qi reception.\n\nIn the first month, one receives the qi of the Responsive Heaven of Primordial Transformation; in the second, the qi of the Heaven of Joyous Paranirmita; in the third, the qi of the Heaven of Silent Tuṣita; in the fourth, the qi of the Heaven of Brahmā-purohita; in the fifth, the qi of the Heaven of Infinite Life of Supreme Meditation; in the sixth, the qi of the Boundless Heaven of Utmost Joy; in the seventh, the qi of the Heaven of Numinous Transformation and Brahmā’s Assistants; in the eighth, the qi of the Heaven of Lofty Emptiness and Luminous Clarity; in the ninth, the qi of the Heaven of No-Thought, No-Knots, No-Attachment; in the tenth, the qi of the Heaven of Parinirmita-vaśavartin; in the eleventh, the qi of the Heaven of Brahmā-kāyika; and in the twelfth, the qi of the Heaven of Brahma-pāriṣadya.\n\nYet when cross-referenced with the nine heavens of the *Sutra of Divine Transformations*, their names bear no resemblance. If one discusses the reception of qi in humans, it must originate from the nine heavens. For instance, in the first month of gestation, one receives the qi of the Boundless Heaven of Utmost Joy—this is a fixed principle. If extended to twelve months, other interpretations may arise, but these are not adopted here.\n\n**The Imperial Perfected Embryonic Destiny: The Primordial Yellow-Evolved Qi of the One**\n\nWhen the Great Void gathers, there is qi; when qi gathers, there is essence. As qi gathers and essence coalesces, it is enveloped in earth, and the principle of incipient life is activated. As the scripture states: \"When male and female unite in essence, the embryonic womb begins to flourish.\" If yin envelops yang, a male is formed; if yang envelops yin, a female is formed. Riding the predestined fate of past lives, one is then born as a human—hence the term \"enveloped destiny.\"\n\nThe nine chapters of the *Primordial Beginning* each contain the four characters \"Imperial Perfected Destiny-Origin.\" The Imperial Perfected is the Primordial Sovereign of the Yellow Court, residing below the Gate of Destiny, governing the qi of generation. Thus, this chapter states: \"The Imperial Perfected first illuminates essence.\" As it governs without form, it is called \"Imperial\"; as it is the Supreme One without peer, it is called \"Perfected.\" The nine heavens are arrayed in proper order, all following the command of the Imperial Perfected. Therefore, each of the nine chapters must include the two characters \"Imperial Perfected\"—this is fixed and unchanging.\n\nWhen bestowed by heaven, it is like gold in the forge, like clay in the mold. Once the vessel is formed, square cannot become round, nor can crooked become straight. The teal’s legs are short, the crane’s legs are long—no iota can be added or subtracted.\n\nThe *Primordial* is the ancestor of qi’s initial generation. Its merit is profound, its craftsmanship wondrous; all things originate from it. \"Great indeed is the Creative, from which all things derive their beginning; perfect indeed is the Receptive, from which all things derive their birth.\" When the primordial qi first envelops, its form resembles a hanging sack, adhering to the spleen as its seed. The spleen is the true earth, upon which all things rely for generation. The Central Yellow Supreme One is the destiny of one’s own life—hence the term \"the primordial yellow-evolved qi of the One.\" *Evolved* is like the unfolding of the primordial net; all that lives cannot exist outside this.\n\n**Merging with the Hollow Void’s Qi, the Flying Spirits Drift in the Remote and Desolate.**\n**Extending Eons Without Term, Vast and Distant from the Root.**\n**Suffering Souls Sink Through Nine Nights, Awaiting Dawn to Yearn for the Sun’s Radiance.**\n\nWhen male and female unite in essence, the embryonic womb begins to flourish. That which has form is born from the formless—the formless is the hollow void’s qi. Heaven One generates water, which, together with earth, is enveloped in the self. The self is the true yang; true yang, from the self, embraces the north. Males revolve leftward for ten months and are born in the tiger (third earthly branch); females revolve rightward for ten months and are born in the monkey (ninth earthly branch). The monkey is the three yin; the tiger is the three yang. When the three yin and three yang are undivided, they are enveloped in the self—this is the time of merging.\n\nWater and earth evolve to fulfill their function—hence the term \"yellow-evolved.\" This is the true earth of the Great Clarity. Before qi is enveloped, it scatters in the realm of nothingness; before humans receive life, their souls and spirits drift in the remote and desolate. *Remote* signifies obscurity; *desolate* signifies distance. As the *Scripture of Lord Lao’s Exhortation to the Body* states: \"The Dharma Wheel turns in the remote and desolate; diligently practice the path to the distant shore.\"\n\nThose who grasp at life often linger from the eon of Extended Health to the present, passing through countless epochs—like a blind person walking south from Dark Mountain, growing ever more distant with each step, never to return to the source of life, thus \"vast and distant from the root.\" Inevitably, they follow suffering souls, sinking through the nine nights without beholding the light, sitting and awaiting dawn, striving to yearn for the radiance of the sun’s divine light. These six lines describe those who fail to receive life, drifting in delusion and transmigration, devoid of perception, awareness, or knowledge. They must endure hundreds of thousands of kalpas, their forms dissolving, their hearts withering—yet the benighted remain unaware.\n\nThe Great Possession opens the Gate of Mystic Wonder,\nWhere Yu Shan descends from the Divine Empyrean.\nYellow clouds congeal in the numinous palace,\nAs yin and yang’s qi-images intertwine.\nThe primordial womb binds long life,\nAnd evil roots dissolve in transformation.\n\nThe Great Possession lies north of Jade Capital, belonging to earth.\nNorth is the position of water—thus water and earth are the root of generation.\nIn human terms, the \"muddy nine\" resides above, belonging to yang’s embrace,\nWhile below lies the \"mysterious gate,\" the passage through which the fetal bowels first form.\nAccording to the *Purple Texts of the Upper Canon*, this is the Mystic Portal.\nReciting the scripture once unblocks the primordial womb’s flow.\n\nThe realm of Yu Shan is the moon’s upper abode.\nThus the *Scripture of Solar Essence* states:\n\"Return solar essence to Floating Black,\nDraw forth yellow qi from Yu Shan.\"\nNow the qi of Yu Shan descends from yin and yang,\nAnd yin-yang’s qi originates in sun and moon—\nThe morning empyrean is the domain of sun and moon.\nYellow clouds are the yellow qi.\nThe numinous palace is the stomach duct.\nHeaven and earth conjoin in pregnancy at *hai*,\nAs the first yang arises in the northwest.\n*Ren* is yang water, uniting with *ding*’s yin fire—\nThus the intertwining of yin-yang’s images appears.\nWhen *ren* first stirs in the Gate of Life, it is the primordial womb.\nHence it is said: \"The primordial womb binds long life.\"\nSince it is called \"long life,\" from this point life begins—\nHow could the six gradual stages be burdened by evil roots?\nThe *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states:\n\"The fetal sac of Jade Clarity, the embryo’s knot unfolds in radiance,\nSeven ancestors return to the womb, and my life attains long existence.\"\n\nOnly now is life received, necessarily relying on the qi-womb.\nOnce the knot is tied, the gradual formation of life begins.\n\nPeach-Kang unites essence to extend,\nThe Two Emperors flourish with jade splendor.\nThey irrigate the Gate of Life’s womb,\nRefining essence so spirit does not wither.\nPeach-Kang is the spirit of the Gate of Life, named \"Uniting Essence to Extend,\"\nGuarding below the human navel.\nIt is also called the revered spirit of the Great Cavern,\nRevolving wind to merge as the honored Unity.\nSome say Peach-Kang is the spirit of the Great One.\nThe Two Emperors refer to the Spirit Emperor and the Revered Emperor.\nThe *Hidden Book* states:\n\"Without the Great One, the Spirit Emperor’s emptiness does not revolve qi;\nWithout the Great One, the Revered Emperor’s Three Ones do not reside.\"\nThus the spirit of the Great One joins with the Five Spirits to serve the Two Emperors.\n\"Jade splendor\" speaks of purity.\nThe *Scripture of the Cavern* says:\n\"Amidst the forest of jade branches\"—\nThe intent is the same as the Gate of Life, though the learning differs.\nOnce the root-womb is initially formed, it becomes the Gate of Life,\nHence the Gate of Life is also called the \"root-womb.\"\nFrom this, the principle of life’s ceaseless generation arises.\nWithin the twelve hours, the spirit of the Great One circulates the qi of life,\nIrrigating and refining essence, preventing it from withering and decay.\nThe *Yellow Court* states:\n\"Irrigate and nourish the numinous root so it never withers,\nSeal the Gate of Life and treasure its jade.\"\n\nThe Nine Heavens command the Numinous Chapter,\nAnd the spirit of life transcends itself.\nThe Primal Lord bars the gates of death,\nWhile the Marshal recites the Cavern’s hymns.\nOne chant summons the myriad perfected in harmony,\nNine recitations bring all heavens to court.\nBowing in reverence through kalpas of ages,\nWe celebrate this flourishing of the old sprout.\n\nThese eight lines, in ancient interpretation, refer to the hymn of the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings—\nYet whether this is truly so remains uncertain.\nSince the scripture’s text does not record it, it cannot be affirmed.\nIf this is indeed the hymn of the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings,\nIt should form a separate chapter, as with the two recitations of the Perfected of the Great Ultimate later.\nIf it is the hymn of the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings,\nThe tonal rhythm should not flow as if from a single hand.\nThe coherence of the text suggests it is not two chapters merged into one—\nThose with discernment will grasp this themselves.\n\nAfter essence is refined and does not wither, the principle of ceaseless generation arises.\nThus the Nine Heavens send down the Numinous Chapter to blend the hundred spirits.\nHence it is said: \"The Nine Decisions command the Numinous Chapter, and the spirit of life transcends itself.\"\nOnce the spirit is born, it is no longer the spirit born of the womb—\nIt is the natural chapter.\nIf I cultivate life, I merge with the spirit;\nIf I do not cultivate life, we remain distinct.\nThe so-called \"spirit\" is the unfathomable of yin and yang—\nHow could it follow human birth and death?\n\"Transcends itself\" means birth and death cannot constrain it.\n\nWithin the body are thirty-nine gates of life and thirty-nine gates of death.\nSince humans depend on life, they fear the gates of death may reopen—\nThus the Primal Lord is commanded to bar them, preventing the gates of death from opening and qi from invading.\nThe *Yellow Court* states:\n\"One must attain true perfection to gaze upon them,\nMost detestable are the dead qi and all impurities.\"\n\nThe Marshal is the Longevity Marshal.\nThe scripture says: \"The Nine Heavens recite this to give life to humans.\"\nWhen a person is to be born, this chapter must be sung,\nCausing qi to congeal and form to take shape.\nThe Marshal chants, and the myriad perfected harmonize—\nFor the Way of Heaven values life,\nAnd all who hear the Cavern’s hymns must join in harmony.\nAfter nine recitations, qi is complete and spirit perfected,\nThe myriad heavens descend in attendance,\nTheir joy and celebration beyond words.\nBowing in reverence, they meet an encounter of ten thousand kalpas—\nFor their ethereal souls,\nSince the era of Extended Health, have been severed by time,\nUnable to receive life.\nNow that life is received, it is like the world’s rice seedlings,\nWhich inherently possess the will to grow—\nWithout entering the soil, their stems and sprouts would not flourish.\nWhen farmers see this, how could they not rejoice?\nThus they bow in reverence through kalpas of ages,\nCelebrating this flourishing of the old sprout.\n\nHence Mo Xi Zi said:\n\"To study the Dao and perfect the true lies in this life;\nThe deluded wait for death before seeking life.\nThis life cannot lack the principle of life—\nEven if life is attained, where will it be born?\"\nThose who recite this poem may take it as the drum and flute for the spirit of life.\n\n**The Second Numinous Chapter of the Heaven of Infinite Life in the Highest Meditation**\n*The Qi of the Imperial Perfected’s Fetal Life, the Primordial Cavern, and the Purple Gate*\n\nThe Purple Gate binds infinite life,\nIts qi honored as the king of heaven.\nIt opens to deliver the flying ethereal souls,\nCongealing and transforming the wheel of empty vastness.\nThe old roots depart from past attachments,\nThe karmic origins long for the ancestral source.\nThrough the long night of distant kalpas,\nThey face the great cycles of destiny’s passage.\n\nThe Yang clarifies and takes form,\nThe Yin congeals and coalesces.\nThe qi of the Heaven of Infinite Life,\nthough rooted in heaven,\nechoes twice through earth—\nits foundation lies in Yin,\nhence it is called the \"congealing of the Purple Gate.\"\n\nIn all people, one *cun* above the space between the brows,\nthree *fen* inward into the bone on the right,\nis the Purple Gate.\nThe old commentary states:\n*\"Its qi is honored as the king of heaven,\"*\nreferring to the Emperor of the Heaven of Infinite Life as the king among heavenly rulers.\nYet all nine heavens have their emperors—\nto single out this one as king is not a precise assertion.\nAlternatively, it is the *qi* itself that is honored,\nfor the character *\"two\"* here lacks coherent principle.\nIn the first month, it is the *bao* (embryonic sac);\nin the second, the *tai* (fetal form)—\nthe *tai* is the incipient shape of the embryo,\nstill an unformed vessel.\nThe principle of life for the entire body\noriginates from its own root,\nbeginning here.\nThus it is called the *\"Primordial Cavern of Fetal Life.\"*\nThough all nine chapters mention *\"life,\"*\nthis *\"life\"* differs from the rest.\n\nThe kidneys and the Gate of Life unite as one.\nAmong the five viscera,\nthe kidneys are uniquely called a *\"pair,\"*\nfor they encompass the gateways of both Yin and Yang, life and death.\nThe Gate of Life is also named the *\"Sea of Qi\"*—\nwhen the text speaks of *\"honored qi,\"* it refers to this.\nIts qi ascends to congeal at the Purple Gate,\nyet one does not perceive its origin in the Gate of Life.\nThis qi is the king of the entire body.\nThe five viscera and six bowels,\nthe hundred joints and hundred vessels,\nthe golden fluids and jade essences,\nthe radiance of sun and moon—\nall stem from the kidneys.\nThus the *Huangting Jing* states:\n*\"It governs the six bowels and the nine fluids’ source.\"*\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The true person’s breath reaches the heels.\"*\nMany commentators take *\"heels\"* to mean the feet,\nbut if breath reached the feet, it would be so—\nwhat is called *\"heels\"* is the Gate of Life.\nIts qi breathes in the Gate of Life,\nlike a child in the womb,\nneither drinking nor eating,\nyet enduring ceaselessly—\nthis is called *\"fetal breathing.\"*\nQi fundamentally arises from the kidneys;\nif it breathed elsewhere, such a principle could not exist.\n\nThe qi in the kidneys is like a ruler in a kingdom.\nThe *\"radiance of the Primordial Cavern and Purple Gate in the nine heavens\"*\nis analogous to the qi in the kidneys—\nthe head is like the king of heaven.\nWhen it resides in the empty vastness,\nthe wheel of transformation turns,\ncirculating without cease.\nThat which is born is born of itself;\nthat which transforms transforms of itself.\nIf there are ethereal souls seeking life,\nthough they shed their old roots\nand depart from past attachments—\nthose old roots are the qi of death.\n\nMost people cling to love and attachment,\ntrapped in endless cycles of birth and death.\nIf one does not first relinquish attachment,\nthe perception of realms remains,\nand one errs into the shoots of various destinies,\nbecoming entangled.\nThis is the *\"second echo\"* of the recitation:\nthe dissolution of fetal congealment and the severing of roots.\nIt speaks of *\"departing from past attachments\"*\nand yet *\"longing for the ancestral source,\"*\nfor human life and death are not matters of a single day.\nReflecting on past lives and deaths,\nall arise from attachment.\nWithout grasping the root, there is no Dao.\nIf one now receives life through the Dao,\nuniting with the ancestral source as one,\npreserving form and exhausting life,\nestablishing virtue and illuminating the Dao,\nsharing radiance with sun and moon,\nand enduring with heaven and earth—\nwhile all others perish, I alone endure,\nonly then is the ultimate realm attained.\n\nClinging to past attachments,\none sinks into the long night,\nkalpas passing in succession,\nunable to find rebirth,\nsuffering and repaying each debt in full.\nNow, as the turning point arrives,\nat the dawn of the great cycle’s renewal,\nthe Primordial Heavenly Worthy opens the era of *\"Great Possession,\"*\nallowing those with aspiration to hear the Dharma’s sound\namidst the reckoning of destinies—\nis this not fortune?\n\nThe Imperial Perfected’s first luminous essence\nis named *\"Self-Originating Yang.\"*\nThe infant, Shi Bohua,\ncongeals the fetus and guards the Yellow Chamber.\nSever the roots and cut off the gate of death,\nnurture harmony and nourish the infant.\nAbove, the Crimson Child;\nin the center, the Primordial Sovereign;\nbelow, the Primordial King—\nthese are the Three Ones.\nThe Primordial King is the spirit of the Gate of Life.\nHis name is *\"First Luminous Essence,\"*\nhis style *\"Primordial Yang,\"*\nalso called *\"Infant Fetus\"* and *\"Bo Shi Yuan.\"*\nThese three phrases all denote the spirit’s names and styles.\n\nAccording to the *Neizhu Pian* of the *Immortal Scriptures*:\n*\"This is the Great One of the Lower Palace.\"*\nThe *Tai Su Yu Lu* states:\n*\"The Great One is the essence of the embryo,\nthe master of transformation,\nthus able to congeal the fetus and form the body\nwithin the Yellow Court.\"*\nThe Yellow Chamber is the Yellow Court.\n\nFor humans, birth is difficult and death easy.\nHaving received life,\none’s qi is subtle and weak,\nwhile Yin evil constantly prevails.\nThe *Scripture of Salvation* says:\n*\"In the Northern Capital’s Winding Springs Palace,\nthere are ten thousand ghosts in throngs,\nall seeking to obstruct human destiny\nand sever the Gate of Life.\"*\nYin ghosts always desire human death,\nlurking in darkness to demand sacrifices.\nOnce a person dies,\nthe hun-soul wanders in the great void,\nseeking offerings—\nthis is the corpse-ghost.\nSuch ghosts mimic human form and speech,\nbut they are not the hun-soul.\nThus the ghostly realm values endings.\nWithout a presiding spirit,\none cannot sever the gate of death’s roots.\nHaving cut them off,\none must nurture harmony to foster life—\nhence *\"nurture harmony and nourish the infant.\"*\n*\"Harmony\"* means peace.\n\nThe infant is the spirit of the lower cinnabar field.\nThe *Huangting Jing* states:\n*\"In the leisurely realm, nurture the true and cultivate flourishing glory.\"*\nThe meditative goodness guides the numinous qi,\nthe mysterious nourishment feeds the flying celestial fragrance.\nThe radiant splendor refines the jade-like essence,\nforging a form of its own.\nStrive for the mysterious and cultivate life,\narraying all in the Hall of Light.\n\nHaving attained nurturance,\nnothing fails to grow.\n*\"Nurturance\"* here does not mean nourishment by things,\nbut by qi.\nThus above it speaks of *\"nourishing the infant,\"*\nand below of *\"meditative goodness guiding the numinous qi,\nthe mysterious nourishment feeding celestial fragrance\"*—\nthese are the means of nurturance.\nOnce the fetus is formed,\nYang generates and Yin nourishes.\nIn this second chapter,\nthe Emperor of the Highest Meditation Heaven\nguides with numinous qi\nand feeds with celestial fragrance—\nthis is the qi of great harmony.\nThus the *Huangting Jing* says:\n*\"Thirst has its own nectar, hunger finds satiety,\"*\nwhich expresses this principle.\n*\"Radiant splendor\"* refers to the brilliance of sun and moon.\n\nThus the *Scripture of the Seven Perfected of Golden Radiance* states: \"If one can fathom the radiant splendor of golden light and the jade-like effulgence in flowing brilliance, one will journey with the Great Obscurity into the midst of the Supreme Void.\" This is the method of exploring the luminosity of sun and moon. According to the *Numinous Writ of the Golden Portals of Highest Clarity*, ingesting solar radiance disperses the knots of death and preserves the congealed mud-pellet [of the brain]. Thus we know that radiant splendor is not merely ingested to nurture the fetus, but also to unbind the knots of the death-gate. The Perfected of the Nine Heavens regard this as the method of ingesting sun and moon. Practicing it over time, the body daily generates luster, the face shines with jade-like light—hence it is said: \"Radiant splendor, jade-like essence, refined through essence to form one’s countenance.\" To cultivate the mysterious and esteem life.\n\nWithin the fetus dwell two spirits. The first is the Lord of White Qi, named \"Cultivator of the Mysterious,\" styled \"Esteemer of Life\"; the second is \"Returner to the Mysterious,\" styled \"Abundant Covering.\" These two spirits together guard above the five viscera. Once the fetal destiny is complete, their spirits are born.\n\nRegarding the Hall of Light, there are two interpretations. In the second month, when the fetus forms, the body is not yet complete—how could it array itself within the Hall of Light? Earlier masters often took the nine palaces as the Hall of Light, yet when the nine palaces are apportioned, the fetus has only begun to take shape, its sense organs not yet formed—this cannot be the Hall of Light in question. The Hall of Light here refers to the Hall of Light of the lungs. Only with the Gate of Destiny does the heart arise; the heart governs blood, modeled on *ding* giving rise to *bing*. Only with the heart do the lungs arise; the lungs govern qi, modeled on *xin* giving rise to *geng*. Thus heart and kidneys divide Yin and Yang, and through mutual restraint, the lungs are generated. We thus know that once the qi of the Cavernous Obscurity’s Purple Gate forms the fetal shape, the lungs arise next, and their spirits array themselves within the Hall of Light of the lungs. For only through mutual restraint is the principle of mutual generation revealed. If the sequence of initial generation were inverted and applied in reverse, the marvel of life’s transformations might well cease.\n\nThe Great Void stirs numinous convergence,\ncommanding me to sing the \"Chapter on Generating Spirit.\"\nAt the first chant, the Nine Mysteries stir;\nat the second recitation, Heaven and Earth commune.\nHarmonizing of itself, they blend;\nnine repetitions complete the work of humanity.\nThe Great Sage rejoices in primordial auspiciousness,\nscattering flowers in homage to the Great Void.\nAll heavens delight in unison,\nall beings bow in reverence.\n\nThe Great Void is the utmost of emptiness. When emptiness reaches its extreme, spirit arises of itself. \"Numinous convergence\" is the name-taboo of the Five Numinous Lords. The scripture states: \"The Controller of Destiny fixes the reckoning; the Five Thearchs oversee life.\" At the time of birth, the Five Elders descend to command the \"Chapter on Generating Spirit\" to send down true qi and gather the myriad spirits—hence it is said: \"The Great Void stirs numinous convergence, commanding me to sing the 'Chapter on Generating Spirit.'\" \"At the first chant, the Nine Mysteries stir\"—reciting it once, the sound reaches the Nine Heavens. \"At the second recitation, Heaven and Earth commune\"—reciting it twice, Heaven and Earth establish reverence. \"Harmonizing of itself, they blend; nine repetitions complete the work of humanity.\" When Heaven and Earth commune, the two interpenetrate to form harmony, and the myriad things are born. When the myriad things are born, the Three Powers are complete, and the Dao of humanity is established—hence it is said to \"complete the work of humanity.\" The \"nine repetitions\" signify that when qi is replete and spirit complete, a person is born. At the time of birth, the Great Sages of all heavens rejoice in its primordial auspiciousness. \"Primordial\" is the chief of virtues; \"auspicious\" means nothing is not favorable. Thus the immortal Dao is ever auspicious, while the ghostly Dao is ever inauspicious. Now that one has become human, the ghostly Dao no longer blocks the gate of life or severs the Gate of Destiny. The joy of auspiciousness cannot be described—scattering flowers in homage, one dances with hands and leaps with feet without awareness. The Highest Perfected of all heavens universally rejoice, bowing their heads in reverence for the Dao of rebirth.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Heavenly Watcher of the Brahmā Realm* states:\n**\"Chapter Three: The Chapter on Generating Spirit\"**\n*The Qi of the Emperor Perfected, the Luminous Immortal of the Long-Lived Spirit-Soul*\nThe Watcher of Brahmā extends the Three Numinous Ones,\nthe qi of Primordial Mystery and Origin divides.\nVastly the Great Brahmā spreads,\nradiant splendor, emerald jade honor.\n\nThe soul is completed in Heaven; once the soul is complete, the root of the entire body is established. Heaven takes the Three Luminaries as its root; humanity takes the Three Hun-Souls as its root. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: \"The Three Luminaries of Illuminating Clarity are the root of Heaven.\" The Five Scripts open and expand, universally planting the numinous spirits. By \"universally planting the numinous spirits,\" the myriad transformations arise therefrom, and their vastness and completeness may be known. Once the qi of the human soul gathers, the Five Agents and hundred spirits all assemble—thus it concludes with the \"Three Sections and Eight Luminaries,\" the principle of which is evident.\n\nTo speak of Heaven is necessarily to take the body as its foundation; to speak of humanity is necessarily to take Heaven as its wholeness. *Zhuangzi* states: \"Heaven and Earth are born together with me; the myriad things and I are one.\" For Heaven and humanity have never been separate.\n\nThe qi of the Watcher of Brahmā is the primordial qi of Heaven. Primordial qi is the ancestor of the Great Brahmā; the primordial net unfolds, nothing is untouched. The Three Qi of Mystery, Origin, and Beginning divide therefrom, and the Nine Heavens are born thereby—hence it is said: \"The Watcher of Brahmā extends the Three Numinous Ones; the qi of Primordial Mystery and Origin divides.\" The \"Three Numinous Ones,\" according to the *Scripture of Nurturing Spirit in the Yellow Court*, are the spirits within the heart, whose names are three: the Numinous Lord of Vermilion, the Numinous Lord of Brightness, and the Numinous Lord of Yellow. When the Three Numinous Ones gather, the root of the entire body is established. Just as the qi of the Great Brahmā pervades boundlessly, the heavens are differentiated, each generating its luminous realm—necessarily taking the Jade Capital Mountain as the meeting place of the Three Heavens, with the Primordial Beginning as the most honored of the myriad heavens. Hence it is said: \"Vastly the Great Brahmā spreads, radiant capital, emerald jade honor.\" \"Vast\" describes its boundlessness; \"radiant capital\" refers to the Jade Capital. \"Jade honor\" means the Jade Thearch is the most honored. Discussing it in terms of the body, within the mud-pellet [of the brain] is the palace of the Jade Thearch—truly the Heavenly Treasure Lord.\n\nThe luminous Brahmā flies with the mysterious radiance,\nopening and delivering the souls of the long night.\nThe ethereal spirits hasten to their appointed return,\nqi upon qi returning to their original root.\n\nCarefully considering these four lines: the qi of Brahmā establishes Heaven and Earth. When a person receives life, it must originate from the qi of Brahmā. Within it is the spirit that receives life, named the \"Luminous Brahmā.\"\n\nThe *Rescue from Suffering Universal Incantation* speaks of the six qi flowing freely, with the Luminous Brahmā unfolding its summoning—this is the reference. The \"mysterious radiance\" is the dragon one rides. According to the *Sutra of Empty Constancy and Transformation*: \"The rustling mysterious radiance ascends on the subtle breeze’s wings beneath the Great Yang.\" The *Scripture of the Golden Clarity Seven Perfected* states: \"Those who cultivate the true should visualize the Primordial Beginning in the Jade Thearch, the Empty Mystery and the Great Light, ascending the mysterious radiance to inquire of the Nine August Ones.\" The *Method of the South Pole Primordial Lord for Visualizing the Five Stars* says: \"Constantly visualize the five stars, and after fifteen years, the Five Elders will each welcome you with the objects they summon. Only the North Pole Elder, the Mysterious Supreme Immortal Thearch, welcomes with the dragon of mysterious radiance.\" Thus, Chapter Eight states: \"The mysterious radiance illuminates the cloud thoroughfare, its traces transcending the divine beyond.\" The *Scripture of the Dao-Treasure* says: \"The mysterious radiance’s green chariot with its mottled carriage—all are the vehicles of the celestial perfected.\" From this, we know that at the beginning of a person’s life, the spirit of the Luminous Brahmā drives the dragon-chariot through the Great Void, delivering the souls of the long night and guiding the wandering spirits to their place of birth. After a person’s death, the soul-spirit drifts in the Great Void, like one traveling far from home, long absent from their native land. Relying on this life-spirit, each returns to its origin. In the first month, the embryo forms; in the second, the fetus; in the third, the soul. Once the three souls are established, the roots are deep and the stem firm, qi upon qi returning to their origin—thus the body may be formed.\n\nThe Great Thearch is titled \"Yang Hall,\" styled \"Eightfold Spirit Lord.\" The Ninefold Opening turns the Dao of fortune, and the fetal qi generates the Upper Prime. The Numinous Brahmā delivers the register of life; the Great One assists the essence in its extension. The Mud-Pellet spreads the Thearch’s seat, and the Three Sections and Eight Radiances divide. The soul arises, gathering the wandering qi; through nine revolutions, one naturally attains immortality.\n\nOnce the soul is complete and qi upon qi returns to its root, one may align the seven spirits within the body. The Great Thearch is the essence-soul, named \"Yang Hall King,\" styled \"Eightfold Spirit.\" The seven spirits are the Mysterious Father, Mysterious Mother, Thearch Sovereign, Nine Thearchs, Great Thearch, Heavenly Thearch, and Record Thearch—seven in all. The Ninefold Opening is the Heavenly Thearch’s soul, named \"Record of the Turning Dao,\" styled \"Record of the River’s Name.\" The Shu version of the scripture writes \"Nine Passes,\" named \"Record of the Turning Dao.\" Only the *Scripture of Generating the Spirit* writes \"Turning Fortune Dao.\" It is unclear whether \"Turning Fortune Dao\" or \"Record of the Turning Dao\" is correct. Only the \"Ninefold Opening\" two characters are confirmed by the *Method of Lord Pei’s Conduct*, which states: \"The assembled perfected gather at the Terrace of the Great Subtlety, opening the gates of the Nine Heavens above.\" The annotation says: \"Paying homage to the Grand Simplicity, the prayer reads: 'Heavenly Pass of the Ninefold Opening.'\" If \"pass\" is taken for \"opening,\" then \"Turning Fortune Dao\" might still be plausible, though it should not have the character \"record\" inverted to \"fortune.\" Further correction by the learned is awaited. Moreover, during the Lin’an period, a commentary on the *Scripture of Generating the Spirit* explained \"Turning Fortune Dao\" as the name of a fire spirit—an even greater error. Thus, we know that scriptural commentaries err differently than chapter annotations. Scholars must devote their utmost care.\n\n\"The fetal qi generates the Upper Prime.\" According to the *Jade Record of the Grand Simplicity*: \"The soul and spirit arise from the fetal form; in the third month, the soul forms, its qi originally born from the fetus.\" The Great Harmony August One, the Elder Lord, governs the qi of the fetal origin, emerging from the Purple Tenuity—precisely within the Kunlun, the abode of the Great One. Kunlun is the Palace of the Upper Prime. This means the soul receives life beginning from the fetal qi, its position in the Palace of the Upper Prime. The Numinous Brahmā is the name of the Great One Thearch Lord, also called the Divine Elder, guarding the space between a person’s brows—this is the Purple Chamber’s inner palace. Thus, the *Yellow Simplicity Scripture of the Forty-Four Directions* prays: \"The Numinous Brahmā treads prosperity, the Ninefold Spirit Elder, the Great One’s diligent attendant, the Five Spirits’ Yellow Tranquility.\" The character \"陵\" is often mistakenly written as \"凌.\" It governs a person’s lifespan, so the *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir* says: \"The Elder Who Controls Life presides over the origin of one’s life-year, holding the records of longevity and early death. Thus, the spirit who oversees life determines the length of one’s allotted years.\" \"Assists the essence in its extension\" means aiding the spirit of the Gate of Life, where \"extension\" is the character for \"peach and well-being.\" The Mud-Pellet is the upper cinnabar field, the Heavenly Thearch’s dwelling—thus, \"the Mud-Pellet spreads the Thearch’s seat.\" The Mud-Pellet contains nine palaces, all places where the Thearch Lords enter, rest, and reside. Once the Thearch’s seat is spread, the Three Sections and Eight Radiances naturally divide. The *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir* says: \"Humans receive life from Heaven; the soul coalesces from the Primordial Spirit. The revolving nine qi give rise to life through the merit of the Great One Heavenly August. Nine transformations become spirit, and merit completes the human form. Body and spirit unite. When qi follows the soul’s birth, it daily circulates the mother-child qi, transforming with the spirit alongside the form—this is the Dao of immortality. How could it be otherwise? Those who act thus undergo nine revolutions and naturally become immortals. If one ceases effort, so too does this.\"\n\nThe resonant sound of the Nine Heavens rings clear, and the jade scripture gives birth to the ten thousand spirits. Thrice recited, they array in their proper positions; the qi joins the gates of the eight celestial paths. The Mysterious Pass blocks the Gate of Death; the numinous guards the source of fluids. Responding to the meeting, it senses the numinous number; the luminous Dao subtly revolves the wheel. Celebrating this infant’s shedding, we bow our heads to praise the cavern scripture.\n\n\"Resonant\" describes the sound’s clarity and stirring power. The spirit can dwell in qi, and qi can retain the spirit. The jade scripture of generating the spirit is the coagulation of qi; when qi coagulates, it forms spirit, and the ten thousand spirits thus arise. That which occupies the upper position is pure qi; that which occupies the lower is turbid qi; that which occupies the middle is harmonious qi. Threefold reverence to the spirit, refining the soul-gate for immortality—this is the thrice-recited array in proper position. \"The qi joins the gates of the eight celestial paths.\" The eight paths of Heaven can bring fortune or misfortune. Those who know their Dao are unfathomable to ghosts and spirits, riding dragons through the void, their spirit wandering boundlessly. The *Chart of Authority and Dao* says: \"The Rest Door connects to the Crimson Palace of Heaven; the Life Door connects to the Hall of Brightness of Heaven; the Birth Door connects to the Jade Hall of Heaven.\"\n\nThese three gates, when opened, bring fortune, residing above the Three Heavens. There is also the Death Gate, which connects to the qi of death; the Blocked Gate enters the Door of Death; the Wound Gate and the Fright Gate are the paths where the two qi divide. The Capital Gate lies where yang qi utterly perishes. These eight gates of the celestial paths bear both fortune and misfortune—misfortune is the Door of Death.\n\nThe Purple Void Dao Lord states in the *Upper Scripture of the Grotto Chamber*: \"Ascend the Purple Gate, gaze upon the eight celestial paths, guide the Cinnabar Palace, and assemble the luminous spirits.\" The Mysterious Pass is the lower Cinnabar Field. The *Declarations of the Perfected* says: \"Guard and seal the Primordial Pass, inwardly preserve the Nine Perfected; the threefold qi circulates the fluids, irrigating the Cinnabar Field.\" The Gate of Destiny lies three inches below the navel—this is the Gate of Life. When the Gate of Life opens, the Door of Death closes. Thus it is said: the Mysterious Pass obstructs the Door of Death, the numinous guards the source of fluids. \"Numinous\" refers to spirit. When spirit securely abides in the lower field, fluids flow unimpeded, and hunger and thirst no longer arise. As the *Yellow Court* states: \"Above, it harmonizes with the Triple Burner; below, it descends as jade nectar. Mysterious fluids course like clouds, dispelling foulness and fragrance, governing and refining the five directions. Draw the fluids to the Mysterious Throat and enter the Hall of Brightness.\"\n\nAt this very moment, when spirit responds and qi is complete, it is the time when the flying immortals and divine beings initiate transformation. The radiant Dao spreads widely; dark souls hear of it and attain liberation, no longer subject to the wheel of rebirth. Then qi coagulates into essence, essence resonates into spirit, spirit transforms into the infant, and the infant is the True Unity of the lower Cinnabar Field. Having attained the transformed body of the infant, one may, following the methods of the *Great Grotto*, soar through the Three Realms. Thus it is said: \"Responding to the convergence of numinous numbers, the radiant Dao secretly reverses the wheel. Celebrating this infant’s transformation, we bow in homage to the *Grotto Scripture*.\"\n\n**Chapter Four of the \"Silent Convergence\" from the *Celestial Liturgy of Life and Spirit*: The Imperial Perfected, the Po-Soul’s Destiny, and the Qi of Yuan-Yang’s Evolution from the Dark Corpse**\n\nAt the beginning of human transformation, it is called the *po*-soul. While the *hun*-soul abides, the *po* follows it; when the *hun* departs, the *po* has no support—hence it is called a corpse. The *hun*-qi governs ascent, while the *po*-body governs descent. Thus the Perfected of Impassive Void states: \"It belongs to the heavy and turbid, and thus it gathers.\" The heavy and turbid are of the *po*’s kind. When gathered, it becomes as solid as an object—hence it is called the \"corpse of evolution.\"\n\nAfter three months in the womb, the *hun* is formed; when the *hun* is complete, the *po* is also born. There is nothing that does not arise from qi, converging without constraint—hence it is called \"dark.\" \"Dark\" means union. From whence does qi come? It is the qi of the Primordial Unity’s Yellow Evolution, as the *Zhuangzi* states: \"The qi of the entire world is one.\"\n\nSilent, formless, it upholds the ancestral lineage;\nThe *Doushu* Heaven resists the Great Veil.\nNuminous transformations divide the Four Sceneries,\nMyriad strands of emerald and vermilion clouds.\n\nThe Primordial Qi generates the *Yudan* Heaven, the *Shanyi* Heaven, the *Xuyan* Heaven; the Yuan Qi generates the *Douyan* Heaven, the *Bujiaole* Heaven, and the *Huayingsheng* Heaven. Only the *Jiran Doushu* Heaven lies below the Great Veil Heaven and above the Four Heavens of the Formless Realm—hence it is said: \"Silent, formless, it upholds the ancestral lineage; the *Doushu* resists the Great Veil.\" The character *kang* (抗) is pronounced *hang* (航), meaning \"to carry,\" for it bears the weight like a boat. The *Doushu* Heaven lies below the Great Veil, thus functioning like a vessel carrying things. If interpreted as *kang* (resisting), it would imply opposition to the Great Veil, which is illogical and harms the meaning.\n\nAfter the Yuan Qi transforms and generates the *Doushu* Heaven, it further generates the Four Heavens of the Formless Realm—this is what is meant by \"numinous transformations divide the Four Sceneries.\" The *Scripture on Subduing Demons* states: \"The Great Sun harmonizes with the morning audience; numinous transformations divide the Four Canopies.\" The Four Sceneries are also called \"chariots.\" In ancient times, the Most High Dao Lord rode the chariot of the Four Sceneries. \"Myriad strands of emerald and vermilion clouds\" refers to the generation of the Formless Realm, where each heaven possesses its own sun, moon, clouds, and auroras. The people of these heavens constantly gather and consume the essence of the sun and moon, along with vermilion clouds. As the *Red Writ Jade Formula* states in its cloud-feeding incantation: \"Within lies plain yellow, the home of the Primordial Beginning. Three white dragons harness the sevenfold majestic qi, lingering at the Jade Gate, dispersing the essence of vermilion clouds.\" The Lady of the Southern Marchmount says: \"Clouds are the essence of the sun.\" The method of consuming clouds is most secret; the way to summon clouds remains unseen. This refers to the practice of embodying jade radiance and auroras, reflecting the methods of the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe wandering soul does not turn back;\nOnce departed, it vanquishes the hordes of demons.\nThe Divine Duke captures the wandering qi,\nDrifting and refining the pure essence.\n\nThe *po* forms in the earth—it is yin—and delights in death. The methods of the *Great Grotto* include techniques to restrain the *po*, preventing its dissipation. When one dreams of battling others, it is the work of corpse-demons—corpse-demons are the *po*. If a person dies, their *po* departs forever, pursuing the six grottoes of demonic hordes, for it delights in finding companions. However, the Emperor of *Doushu* Heaven presides over the salvation of living beings in the world. Once one attains human form, the *po* is completed in the fourth month. If the wandering *po* does not return, it must rely on the Divine Duke to capture it. The Divine Duke is the Prime Minister of the Jade Clarity Heaven. When he was once tasked with subduing the Northern Feng, the Jade Clarity’s Prime Minister was appointed as the commander of the punitive expedition. Since his role involved leading the army, he was titled the Divine Duke. In terms of the body, this refers to the lung, called the \"Divine Achievement.\" The *po* makes its home in the lung, which also governs qi, and its color is white. If the wandering *po* returns, one must refine its qi to generate essence. Thus the *Yellow Court* states: \"Hasten to preserve the White Prime and harmonize the six qi; immortals endure long without calamity.\"\n\nFlourishing and splendid, it anchors the kalpa’s term,\nRiding the turning of fate, responding to the numinous chart.\nThe *Grotto Scripture of Life and Spirit* arises,\nJade tones soar beyond the ninefold clouds.\nOne chant summons the assembly of the ten thousand Perfected,\nAscending in splendor, they unite as one family.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven values life, and life’s root is qi. When qi resides within the body, the body attains longevity. Thus the immortals say: \"Spirit commands qi, qi preserves form; without relying on external aids, one naturally attains long life.\" When the body achieves longevity, it equals the great kalpa’s span, flourishing and unwithering. Riding this turning of fate, one may inscribe their name in the Mysterious Union.\n\nIn his letter to Lady Yunlin, Xu Mu writes: \"Fortunate to encounter the mysterious turning, the numinous awakens its convergence.\" Thus it is said: \"Flourishing and splendid, it anchors the kalpa’s term, riding the turning of fate, responding to the numinous chart.\" Without the *Grotto Scripture of Life and Spirit*, this Dao would not be easily attained. Hence it is said: \"The *Grotto Scripture of Life and Spirit* arises, jade tones soar beyond the ninefold clouds. One chant summons the assembly of the ten thousand Perfected, ascending in splendor, they unite as one family.\" The \"jade tones\" refer to the *Scripture of Life and Spirit*, resonant as jade’s melody. The *True Transmission of the Three Caverns* states: \"The Perfected draws in the radiance of the five directions’ primordial dawn and consumes the essence of the ninefold clouds.\" Nine is the yang number, hence \"ninefold clouds.\" As the *Scripture of Golden Perfection* says: \"Ascending through the ninefold clouds, soaring in the Upper Clarity, in a single chant, the ten thousand Perfected assemble—unbidden, yet thus it is.\" \"Ascending in splendor, they unite as one family\": *shuang* denotes the hun-soul. The po-soul returns to the hun-soul as its home. When hun and po unite, there can be no separation. This is the unity from which life is formed. Without yin, yang cannot arise; without yang, yin cannot be completed—the Dao of yin and yang is truly vast!\n\nNine transformations complete the numinous radiance,\nLush and resplendent, they illumine the jade blossom.\nThe arts of Dou open the great abundance,\nOne celebration bestows boundless blessings.\nThe Supreme Sage turns the imperial chariot,\nThe Divine Child and Elder Brother suddenly sing.\nOverwhelmed by the auspicious assembly,\nAll bow their heads in harmony.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Supreme Perfection* states: \"Formless in primordial chaos, it transforms nine times in a single day; only after nine transformations does it gain function.\" The *Scripture of Life and Spirit* is the ancestor of qi. When a person is conceived, only when the nine qi are complete can a human form be achieved. If even one qi is lacking, it leads to premature death or deficiency. Each chapter must be recited nine times to fulfill the work of human formation, nine times to ascend and pay homage to the heavens, nine transformations to attain immortality—thus reaching this chapter. It also says: \"Nine transformations complete the numinous radiance.\" Once the po-soul exists, it must await the ninth month, when qi is full and spirit complete, before birth can occur. *Ling* denotes spirit. The *Golden Root Scripture of the Purple Book* states: \"Returning the wind’s chaotic union, congealing nine transformations in the mysterious essence.\" After nine transformations, the lung-qi is sufficient. *Yuyu* describes abundance; *yao* signifies its radiance, and the \"jade blossom\" is the lung. The Heavenly Emperor of Dou is the master of the lung-po, delighting in liberation. When the great abundance is resolved above, if one can give life to the heavens and descend as a Supreme Sage, they ascend in their chariot and assemble. Then the Divine Child commands the divine infants to sing the boundless hymn, and the living instantly attain the chamber of the three refinements. All the heavenly beings, overjoyed, fortunate to encounter this auspicious moment—when the sound ascends and the spirits of the nine heavens rejoice—bow their heads in unison. Thus it is said: \"The arts of Dou open the great abundance, one celebration bestows boundless blessings. The Supreme Sage turns the imperial chariot, the Divine Child and Elder Brother suddenly sing. Overwhelmed by the auspicious assembly, all bow their heads in harmony.\"\n\n**Fifth Chapter: The Joyous Heaven of Pāramitā’s *Scripture of Life and Spirit***\n*The Qi of the Five Immortals within the Emperor’s True Storehouse of the Viscera and Life-Origin*\n\nFluttering, the Five Emperors’ chariots,\nDrifting, they arrive at the Gate of the Mysterious Above.\nStrolling through the Yellow Flower Wilderness,\nReturning the spirit to the joyous end.\nGathering the flying ethereal souls,\nOld *shuang* are mostly lost.\n\nHeaven One resides in the storehouse to initiate beginnings,\nHeaven Five resides in the viscera to complete endings.\nThe qi of metal, wood, water, and fire cannot form without earth;\nThe origins of heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys cannot be nourished without the spleen.\nThe qi of the nine heavens first descends as the embryo, called the \"primordial yellow qi of Yuan Yi.\"\nBy the fifth month, the five viscera are differentiated, also named the \"central numinous qi.\"\nThus, it is known that the one who initiates and completes is none other than earth.\nHence it is said: \"Fluttering, the Five Emperors’ chariots.\" The Five Emperors have been explained above.\nThe scripture states: \"Five times paying homage to the Five Emperors purifies the storehouse and viscera.\"\n*Fanfan* describes the soaring appearance. Drifting, they come from the Gate of the Mysterious Above—ancient commentaries take the Gate of the Palace Above as the Gate of the Mysterious Capital.\nThe \"Yellow Wilderness,\" when aligned with the body, is the spleen. The spleen’s mutual generation descends qi to the heart; when spleen-qi is sufficient, it generates the lungs. Thus it is said: \"Strolling through the Yellow Flower Wilderness, returning the spirit to the joyous end.\" The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: \"The numinous terrace, lush and verdant, gazes upon the Yellow Wilderness; the three-inch winged chamber has above and below\"—directly referring to the heart and spleen. Thereupon, gathering the flying ethereal souls to form a person, as time passes, the *hun-shuang* dissolve into ashes. The *Scripture of Precepts and Ranks* states: \"The dead form turns to dust, flying and transforming into *shuang*.\" Thus it is said: \"Gathering the flying ethereal souls, old *shuang* are mostly lost.\" Alas! The disparity between life and death reaches this extremity. The ancients said: \"To lose the human form once is to be irrecoverable for ten thousand kalpas.\" Those in the world who treat life lightly—hearing this, how could they not grieve?\n\nThe Great Tenuous Yellow Banner,\nThe Radiant Pennant commands the numinous.\nSummoning the long-night abode,\nLiberating and receiving the living souls.\nThe Duke’s son assists in Yellow Tranquility,\nRecording in full both form and spirit.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Three Primordials’ Edicts* states: \"Within the Palace of the Great Ultimate are nine names; the third is the Great Tenuous.\"\n\nMan receives life all from the Great Tenuous,\nwhere spirits descend and qi is distributed,\nwhere the body takes form and shape is established.\nFirst, one is endowed with the essence-qi of yin and yang;\nnext, the hun-souls and po-souls coalesce.\nThe Three Divisions are arrayed,\nthe Three Offices are rectified.\nWhen the spirit enters the body,\nlife and nurture commence at once.\n\nThose who miscarry at the first formation of the embryo\ndo so because the qi of the Great Tenuous fails to connect.\nThose who fall after taking form\ndo so because the spirits of the Three Offices do not reside within.\nThose who perish after birth\ndo so because the spirit of their allotted destiny is not inscribed.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Three Ones* states:\n\"Within the Great Tenuous are twenty-four qi,\nwhere primordial yellow mingles and gathers,\ntransforming non-being into being.\"\nWithin the qi are twenty-four Perfected,\nall ministers of the Three-One August Emperors.\nBanners, pennants, talismans, and edicts\nare the vanguard of commands.\n\nOnce the body is born but the hun-spirits are not yet complete,\nbanners and pennants must be used to summon them.\nWithin the Great Tenuous is a youth named Jingjing,\nwho stands always before the Emperor,\nawaiting only the command\nto grasp the Yellow Banner and gather the flying ethereal souls.\nYellow is the central color,\nhence it is called the Revolving Yellow Banner.\n\nWu-ying is the hun-spirit,\nnamed Lord Yuan-su,\nalso called Divine Son,\nwho guards the rear gate of the liver.\nFor the hun-spirit to be whole and complete,\nit must be summoned by the command of the Great Tenuous\nwith the Numinous Pennant.\n\"Numinous\" means \"spirit,\"\nand also that the dead’s essence and blood do not stagnate.\nThus it is said: \"The Duke’s son assists in Yellow Tranquility,\nrecording in full both form and spirit.\"\nThe Duke’s son refers to Wu-ying.\nYellow Tranquility is the Three Perfected of essence and blood,\nnamed the Three Lords of Life,\nstyled Yellow Tranquility,\nwho guard below the nostrils of man.\n\nThus the *Scripture of Salvation* says:\n\"Wu-ying, Duke’s Son,\nWhite Prime, Venerable Spirit.\"\nIt also says: \"Within, the five qi are ordered,\nthe hundred spirits blend and unite.\"\nThen who could surpass the central numinous qi\nin recording form and spirit?\nThus the *Guardian-Spirit Incantation* says:\n\"It is the qi governing the center that unifies the primordial Perfected.\"\n\nThe jade stanzas illumine the hidden and numinous,\nfive revolutions divide Heaven

grass,\nsinking fragrance,\nand frankincense.\nThe Holy Mother is the Holy Mother of the Guardian Chamber.\n\nAs for the Three Realms rejoicing together\nand bowing their heads to the Heavenly Worthy—\nwho would dare claim the virtue of generation and completion\nif not the Heavenly Worthy?\n\n*Chapter Six of the Heaven-Generating Spirit of the Cavernous Mystery’s Resonant

Resonant Transformation,\nthe ruler of the formless realm.\nFrom the Three Clarities the Nine Heavens divide,\nfrom the Nine Heavens the Thirty-Six Heavens divide.\nThe formless realm comprises four heavens,\nmaking the count of twenty-eight heavens.\nTo identify the Heaven of Resonant Transformation\nas one of the formless realm’s heavens\nis certainly incorrect.\nThe wording of this chapter differs from that above,\nand those who explain it often overlook this.\n\nMaster Ge the Immortal said:\n\"The Jade Capital Mountain crowns the eight directions.\"\nHere it says \"crowning the ten directions\"—\nthis is the auroral radiance.\n\"Auroral radiance\" is like the saying \"cavernous brightness.\"\n\"The revolving transformations leave no shadow,\nthe dark term hastens to the Daoist sanctuary\"—\nthis speaks of the people of this heaven\nbefriending transformation\nand merging obscurely with the Great Dao.\n\"The spirit-chariot requires no reins\"—\nthis is from *Zhuangzi*:\n\"Riding the six qi’s changes,\nroaming the infinite.\"\nHaving merged with the Dao’s transformations,\nwhat need is there for reins?\n\"Brightly shines the chapter on generating the spirit\"—\nin the space between a glance and a breath,\nit naturally accords with the chapter on generating the spirit.\n\nThe cavernous truly has no bounds,\nthe mysterious ethereal is also

the tread of the constant.\nSever and fell the stagnation of the womb-tree,\nlet the heart roam and ascend to the Upper Capital.\n\nThe cavernous has been seen above.\n\nQi originates from the womb and embryo,\nthrough the five viscera, soul and spirit,\nhaving already undergone five transformations—\nby this stage, the ethereal soul has grown strong and robust.\nOne must refine its qi,\nreturn to the origin and revert to the root,\nlike the Way of whirling winds merging into oneness,\ntogether forming the Imperial Unity, the One Revered.\n\nEver parting from the Flying Dark Beam.\nAncient commentaries call it a \"bridge-beam,\"\nor else \"Mystic Capital Mountain,\"\nbut these are mere conjectures,\nleading many seekers astray.\nThe *Scripture of Pacing the Void* states:\n\"Lush and verdant, the Dark Beam.\"\nIf it were a bridge-beam,\nwhy insert the words \"lush\" and \"flying,\"\nor speak of \"ever parting\"?\nFollowing the old annotations,\nthe meaning does not cohere.\nThe character *guāi* (parting) accords with the *Scripture of Golden Perfection*,\nwhich says:\n\"In the Upper Dao, pure harmony,\nthe Mysterious within the Mysterious—\nyou must diligently seek it,\nlest you stray from my work,\nlest you stray from my covenant.\"\nUpon repeated reflection,\nthe two characters *xuán liáng* (Dark Beam)\nrefer to a celestial bird.\nWhen the Supreme Perfected Lord of Great Simplicity retired to his retreat,\nthe Three Primordial Ladies of the Upper Clarity rose,\nfacing west to recite the \"Feathered Chapters of Celebrating Perfection\"—\nwithin it is written:\n\"Fluttering and soaring through the nine skies,\nsorrowfully crying, calling the Dark Beam.\"\nSince the scripture includes the word \"flying,\"\nthere is no doubt it is a bird.\nThe present scripture’s purport is that\nrefining the embryo’s qi enables flight,\nthough one may regret not matching the Dark Beam’s avian nature.\nIf a person refrains from hoarding and losing their celestial perfection,\nfrom scattering thoughts in restless calculation,\nfrom adulterating their right mindfulness—\nif they but tread the constant Way,\nthen they may sever and fell the stagnation of the womb-tree’s roots,\nultimately roaming the Jade Capital.\n\nThe vow, once profoundly profound,\nawakens me to principle and forgets both.\nThe nine heavens’ blessings stand upright,\nexchanging rites with the earth’s auspicious stars.\nThe vow refers to the preceding passage:\nrefining the embryo to return to the original beginning,\nletting the heart roam and ascend to the Upper Capital.\nOnly by comprehending the profoundly profound Way\ndoes one fulfill that vow.\nForgetting both principle and self—\nwith self, there is attachment;\nwith principle, there is obstruction.\nOnly without self and without principle\ndoes one accord with the profoundly profound Way.\nThe *Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection* records Gong Borong’s poem:\n\"The profoundly profound then arises.\"\nThe profoundly profound is the \"yet more profound.\"\nHaving entered the profoundly profound,\none’s body merges with the Dao,\nand blessings arrive unbidden, naturally auspicious.\n\nMerging transformations return to the Original Unity,\nloftily conjoining the Primordial King of Yuanshi.\nBowing my head, I join the company of numinous movement,\nforever parting from the clamor of dust and noise.\nThose who receive life in this world\noriginate from the One Qi.\nDivided, it becomes the Three Origins;\nthree times three interweave,\nforming the nine souls,\ngoverned by nine spirits—\nthe Nine Luminous Great Spirits.\nThe first spirit is named Merging Transformations,\nwearing the Great Crown of Through-Heaven,\na green robe and vermilion shoes,\nwielding the Demon-Quelling Treasure Sword,\never riding the nine qi of green radiance,\npresiding over primordial yang.\nThose who know this\nshare the same origin as Yuanshi’s One Qi—\nthen they themselves are the Three Clarities.\n\"Loftily conjoining\"—\nhow could this resemble the petty immortals of lower ranks?\nThus the *Scripture of the Mysterious Mirror* states:\n\"The Original Unity is the chief of the ten thousand Ways,\nrevolving the wheel alongside the numinous movement,\nbecoming one with heaven and earth.\nWhat burden could the clouds of dust impose?\"\nThis is why *Zhuangzi* discarded Yao and Shun as chaff,\nroaming carefree beyond the dust and grime.\nThus the Lady of Right Radiance said:\n\"Gathering the eight paths at the Origin’s Source,\nriding the movement to observe the clamor of dust\"—\nthis is the meaning.\n\n**Numinous Transformations: The Seventh Chapter on the Heaven of Brahmā’s Assistants, Generating the Spirit**\nThe Qi of the Imperial Perfected’s Yuan-Fu, the High Immortals’ Cavernous Summit\n\nThe Mysterious Convergence governs the boundless,\nthe merged qi returns to Brahmā’s Assistants.\nDiligently, it moves numinous transformations,\nsilently propelling without cold or heat.\nRiding the numbers, it constructs the stem of integrity,\nshaking its sleeves to brush away light feathers.\nHeaven regards the north as mysterious;\nhumans regard the heart as mysterious.\nEmerging and entering without fixed time,\nnone know its direction—\nthis may truly be called governing the boundless.\nThe *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir* records the Lady of Purple Tenuity’s song:\n\"The Mysterious Convergence naturally binds,\ndrifting and wandering through the darkly profound.\"\nThe Perfected of the Upper Clarity say:\n\"Once the six senses have mysteriously converged,\nthe eight difficulties thereby darkly vanish.\"\nThe meaning of these words is the same as here.\nThe root of the body is governed by the heart,\nwith qi as its function.\nWhere the heart directs, qi follows.\nMencius said:\n\"The will is the commander of qi.\"\nThe will is where the heart directs.\nOnce the heart embraces the One,\nqi returns to the origin—\nthen seeing, hearing, awareness, and knowing,\nfragrance, taste, movement, and touch\nare but external things.\nThus it is said:\n\"The Mysterious Convergence governs the boundless,\nthe merged qi returns to Brahmā’s Assistants.\"\nIf one now posits that heart and qi do not interact—\nthe heart governing the boundless realm,\nqi returning to the Heaven of Brahmā’s Assistants—\nhow could the work of creation be accomplished?\nFor within, there must be a supreme spirit\nserving as its sovereign.\nBelow, it says: \"Diligently, it moves numinous transformations.\"\n*Wùyóu* is the revered spirit of the Great One,\nnamed *Wùyóu Shou*, styled *Guī Huìchāng*,\nguarding the posterior gate of the Muddy Pellet.\nThe root of generation and completion,\nthe operation of creation—\nnone are not the work of the Great One.\nThough cold and heat alternate,\nthe wondrous function is unceasing.\nWhen the seven stars of the Dipper shine brightly,\nthe apertures open and hearing becomes keen.\nRiding the seven numbers,\na person’s apertures open and hearing becomes keen,\nseeing, hearing, awareness, and knowing all arise from this—\nthis is what is meant by \"riding the numbers to construct the stem of integrity.\"\nAs for humans—\nacting without reliance,\ncompleting work without abiding—\nlike shaking one’s sleeves to brush away light feathers,\nfluttering and soaring to the land of nothing-whatever,\n*Zhuangzi* said:\n\"The Perfect Person does not linger in their movements.\"\nTruly so.\n\nThe jade chamber holds wondrous resonance,\nfloating and ascending to the high spirit’s abode.\nThe wheel turns without ceasing its radiance,\ntrue immortals arrayed in ordered ranks.\n\nThe highest celestial thoroughfares stretch boundless,\nthe Cavernous Origin profound and measureless.\nLush leaves veil the kingfisher mists,\ncasting shade upon the limpid isles.\n\nThe jade chamber lies above the nine heavens.\nThe *Scripture of Cavernous Perfection* states:\nThis is where the Supreme Jade Emperor conceals the golden mystery-feathered chapters,\nwhere myriad spirits hide their resonant secrets.\nThe Lady of Grand Emptiness also says:\nAbove rests the jade chamber,\nflowing through the Jade Clarity.\nIts wondrous resonance is the sound of spontaneity—\nlike the Yellow Emperor’s music of Dongting,\nunprompted by human artifice,\nnaturally forming its harmony.\nThus it is called \"wondrous resonance.\"\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, in his preface to the *Scripture of Pacing the Void*, writes:\nUpon the mountain, seven-jeweled flower groves,\nstirred by the divine wind,\nspontaneously form the tones of gong and shang.\nSighing in wonder at the supreme sound,\nit defies description.\nAll belong to this category.\n\nThe jade chamber is the realm where exalted spirits wander and gaze.\nThose who ascend and drift upon it,\nlike water flowing in an unbroken image,\nbehold within the wheel of sun and moon,\ntheir radiance intermingling without cease.\nTrue immortals array themselves in ordered ranks,\ntowering like a forest,\ngazing up toward the lofty void.\nAbove dwells the Heaven of Clarity and Brightness;\nbelow, one looks down upon the Cavernous Origin.\nThe Heaven of Responsive Transformation lies beneath,\nwhere lush leaves veil the emptiness,\ntheir hue like kingfisher mists,\ncasting shade upon the limpid abyss.\nThe *Scripture of Cavernous Spirit*’s six palaces\ntake the liver as the Palace of Limpid Coolness.\nThe Supreme Perfected One’s *Eight Yang Songs of the Pure Essence*, sixth chapter,\nspeaks of my soaring feathered canopy,\nlingering by the limpid isles—\nthis is precisely what it refers to.\nAll the above records the traces within the jade chamber.\n\nRoaming and delighting, the five spirits are harmonized;\nabundant thoughts call to luminous companions.\n\nThe five difficulties depart when principle is followed,\nand the centered heart finds its own joy.\nThe jade chamber’s abode is not merely a place for roaming delight—\nthe Most High intends it to gladden the five spirits.\nFor spirits love harmony and detest discord,\nthus the *Treasury* contains the *Treatise on Nurturing the Spirit*,\nwhich takes harmony as its sole cultivation.\nHow then could those who refine life fail to gladden the spirit?\n\nThe *True Records of Supreme Clarity* states:\nthe two hands, two feet, and heart together form the five spirits.\nWhen the heart’s thoughts remain ever verdant,\nthe two hands ever crimson,\nand the two feet ever white,\none draws near to transcendence.\nElsewhere, the two eyes, two hands, and lung region combine as the five spirits:\nthe left eye’s youth is Flying Numinosity,\nthe right eye’s youth is Morning Infancy,\nthe left hand’s youth is Welcoming Life,\nthe right hand’s youth is Square Fullness,\nand the lung’s youth is Luminous Purity—\nthese are the names of the five spirits.\nOnce the five spirits are gladdened,\none may dispel excessive thoughts.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n“The Dao does not desire杂 (mixed states);杂 brings disturbance,\nhow much more so its excess?”\nWhen excessive thoughts arise,\nforget them through whistling,\nand one may summon luminous companions.\nFor whistling is a prolonged sound.\nThe ancients who cultivated the Dao used it to guide qi,\nthus the *Sutra of Wisdom* says:\n“The numinous banner inhales the wind and scatters,\nexcessive thoughts vanish in their time.”\nOnce excessive thoughts are dispelled,\nthe five difficulties may indeed be resolved by principle.\nThe five difficulties are:\nbestowing kindness despite poverty,\nlearning the Dao despite great wealth,\ncommanding life to avoid death,\nobtaining the *Cavernous Scripture*,\nand being born in the age of a later sage.\nAll five difficulties stem from excessive thoughts;\nwithout them, the heart finds joy of itself.\n\nThe *Scripture of Western Ascent* says:\n“Dispel defilement, halt thoughts,\npurify the heart, and guard the One.”\nFor those who study the Dao,\nthere is no difficulty apart from governing the heart.\nThus, when Perfected Yin took leave of the Most High,\nhe begged once more for a single word\nas the essential key to cultivation.\nThe Most High replied with:\n“Dispel defilement, halt thoughts,\npurify the heart, and guard the One.”\nThus, purifying the heart is the first task of cultivation.\nTo seek the Great Dao without first governing the heart\nis like raising chickens while keeping a wildcat—\nhow could it succeed?\n\nThis chapter concerns the work of the seven transgressions,\nwhere the apertures open and clarity arises.\nWhy speak of this here?\nFor the root of wisdom lies in the heart.\nIf excessive thoughts linger in the heart,\nwisdom may at times grow dim.\nThus, the opening speaks of “mysterious convergence unifying the boundless,”\nand later of “the centered heart finding its own joy”—\nthe remedy is evident.\n\nThe luminous soul follows its root,\nsteadfast in the empty midst.\nSeven recitations unseal the layered gates,\nstagnation disperses without martial force.\nMovement flows from within,\na lofty chant lifts in reverent salute.\n\nHumans possess spirit as a house possesses a dweller.\nIf the house is incomplete,\nthe soul lingers steadfast in the empty midst.\n“Steadfast” describes its force pressing toward the house,\nyet unable to enter.\nThe “root” refers to Non-Brightness taking the liver as its root,\nand White Prime taking the lung as its root.\nAt the time of the seven transgressions,\nthe apertures are fully opened,\nand obstructions dissolve as if by martial prowess—\nvictory without battle.\n\nThe Dao of generating spirit,\nas a thing, is without duality,\nthus its generation of things is unfathomable.\nWhen the spirit’s mechanism and qi are established,\nthere is that which arises unexpectedly—\nfor within it dwells a governing presence.\nWithout a master within, it does not stand;\nwithout a master without, it does not move.\nThus it is said:\n“Movement flows from within,\na lofty chant lifts in reverent salute.”\n\n**The Eighth Chapter of the Scripture of Generating Spirit in the Heaven of Clarity and Brightness**\n**The Qi of the Imperial Perfected’s Flowery Mansion, Commanding the Primordial Numinous Transformation**\n\nAbove the layered heavens of clarity,\nat the juncture of felicitous clouds,\njade verses scatter into the centered heart,\na solitary radiance seeks numinous convergence.\n\nThe heavens possess nine heavens:\nfrom the Vermilion Completion Mansion of Mysterious Continent, the first is the Solar Heaven;\nthe next, the Wind Heaven;\nthe next, the freezing expanse, called the Layered Heaven.\nNow, the lofty void of clarity and brightness lies above the Layered Heaven.\nThe *Scripture of the Jade Dawn’s Radiant Numinosity* asks:\n“How may one push open the gates of the Layered Heaven\nto witness the beginning and end of heaven and earth?”\nThe *Scripture of the Cavernous Numinous Verses* says:\n“Dragons transform above the Layered Heaven,\nthe Brahma vehicle traverses the kalpa’s wheel.”\nThus we know the dragon’s transformation becomes the seed-people,\nand the clarity of heaven and earth connects with the dragon’s celestial realm.\n\nThe *Concealed Instructions on Ascending Perfection*\ncontains Xin Xuanzi’s poem to Lord Yang:\n“Spirit follows the empty and nonexistent,\nqi dissolves into felicitous clouds.”\nThe “jade verses” refer to the chapter on generating spirit,\nwhich may disperse and harmonize the centered heart—\nthus, “jade verses scatter into the centered heart,\na solitary radiance seeks numinous convergence.”\nIt is like the *Scripture of the Pure and Plain on Phoenix Terrace*:\n“Jade nectar scatters into the centered heart,\nbright maidens sing numinous songs.”\n\nResplendent radiance spreads like rosy clouds,\nthe spirit’s lapels leave none behind.\nJade branches flow with ethereal echoes,\nat ease in the void’s wondrous discourse.\n\nAll the above does not record concrete phenomena\nbut describes the scenery of heaven’s midst,\nthe words of roaming feasts.\nThe *Inner Biography of Perfected Yang* records\nPurple Clarity’s True Consort saying:\n“Grasping the sun’s root,\nI enter the feast of the seven palaces,\ntread the three luminaries and ascend together,\nscatter rosy clouds and soar in my carriage.”\n“The spirit’s lapels leave none behind”\nresembles the *Great Cavern’s* hymns:\n“Mysterious songs disperse the spirit’s lapels,\njade branches flow with ethereal echoes.”\nLike Xin Xuanzi’s words:\n“Raising my head to admire the singing branches,\nthe forest’s emptiness holds unbounded joy.”\n\nNuminous sounds vibrate the empty cavern,\nthe nine mysteries depart their dark descendants.\nInspired clarity knows no stagnation,\ndeparture and lingering are like loosening a sash.\n\nHaving beheld the chapter on generating spirit,\nits wondrous workings are beyond knowing.\nIf seen, the nine mysteries escape the dark night,\nand soaring clarity stirs with feeling—\ndeparture and lingering are free,\nno longer stagnant, like loosening a sash.\nIf one recognizes the use of generating spirit,\none may roam above the three realms,\nno longer subject to the calamities of the nine yangs and six yins—\nthus, “without ultimate defeat.”\n\nMysterious radiance illuminates the celestial thoroughfare,\ntraces transcend beyond the spirit’s bounds.\n\n\"Response and resonance know no fixed form,\nmerely circulating the four great elements.\nWith focused mind, bowing in reverence, one recites—\nall sages together proclaim their joy.\n\nThis chapter, from 'Roaming Above Without Ultimate Defeat,'\nreveals the words of transcending the three realms.\nThe mysterious radiance has been explained earlier.\n'Traces transcend beyond the spirit’s bounds'—\nthis is like Zhuangzi’s roaming beyond the five lakes and four seas.\nNot acting before things arise,\nnot initiating affairs,\nresponding only when pressed,\nmoving only when stirred—\nlike a drunkard falling from a carriage,\nunaware while riding,\nunaware while falling.\nThus it is said: 'Response and resonance know no fixed form,\nmerely circulating the four great elements.\nWith focused mind, bowing in reverence, one recites—\nall sages together proclaim their joy.'\nThese four lines speak of the chapter on generating spirit.\nThe delight of ritual and propriety in my heart\nis like the delight of fine meats in my mouth—\nhow much more so the wondrous workings of the chapter on generating spirit?\nRightly do all proclaim their joy.\n\nChapter Nine: No Thought, No Entanglement, No Attachment—Heaven-Generated Spirit\nThe Qi of the Sovereign Perfected’s Mountain Mansion, Commanding the Primordial, Spontaneously Illuminating in Mysterious Radiance\n\nNo entanglement, thus no emotion,\nin profound profundity, the void settles clear.\nTransformation flows without fixed sequence,\nits reckoning comes yet cannot be grasped.\"\n\nWhen things are insufficient, attachment multiplies;\ndeep attachment binds one to others.\nIn utter destitution, emotion withers;\nestranged emotion breeds resentment.\nOnly the Perfected One cannot be drawn near,\ncannot be exalted,\ncannot be distanced,\ncannot be debased—\nthus is free from entanglement and devoid of emotion.\nThis Heavenly Person’s body merges with the Dao,\nalready entered into the realm of layered mystery.\nForm fills emptiness,\nstill and unchanging;\nsettled, it clarifies of itself,\ntransforming as one with things,\nyet never transformed.\n\nLike a wheel’s turning,\nrevolving without end—\nthis is the pivot of the Dao.\nAt nine cycles, root and origin return to the beginning,\nspirit generates all at once.\nGenerating spirit, one may transcend reckoning.\nAt ten cycles, qi flows freely,\ncommanding the myriad spirits—\nthen soaring through the Upper Clarity,\nsitting to observe kalpas,\nbeyond all calculation.\nThus it is called *unreckonable*.\n\n*Unreckonable* means *cannot be reckoned*.\nThe *Western Ascent* says:\n“From the beginning of past ages,\nall that has passed is like dust and sand.\nMovement brings kalpas upon kalpas—\nI reflect, and find it bitter toil.”\nOnly those without fixed sequence\ncan escape this fate.\n\nWho says the colorless is level?\nLofty, the many hills and mounds.\nWith mind obscured, one wanders freely—\nhigh aspirations summon the spirit’s ascent.\nTrue encounter knows no years,\nhow can kalpas be named?\n\nThose who attain the Dao wander freely without fixed direction—\nnow soaring through the Three Luminaries,\nnow entering and emerging from rivers and seas,\nnow flying across the Five Peaks.\nSuch heavenly beings are called *without thought*,\n*without entanglement, without attachment*,\nfor their comings and goings are perfectly at ease.\n\nThe Heaven of Great Network lies below the Three Heavens of Great Veil,\nfar removed from the Heaven of No-Form.\nThe question *\"Who says...\"* refers to a tradition that some have visited the Heaven of No-Form,\nwhere many hills and mounds abound.\n*\"Lofty\"* describes the appearance of these mounds.\nWith mind obscured, one wanders freely—\nyet with single-minded focus, the spirit may ascend in purity.\nThis is the moment of true encounter.\nDelay, and the kalpic cycles may shift,\nfor this rare meeting must not be missed.\n\nLong ago, Wang Fangping made an appointment with Ma Gu.\nMa Gu replied: *\"I have not seen you for a while—suddenly five thousand years have passed.\nThough rank and reverence remain in order,\nmy longing to meet you is deep,\nyet I cannot leave at once.\"*\nSuch is the vastness of a true encounter—\nhow can one not believe it?\n\nWith mind obscured, one wanders freely,\nas the Lady of Right Florescence instructed Secretary Xu:\n*\"From the heart’s empty cavern, the ford,\nI take the reins of the crimson carriage.\"*\n*\"Floating clarity clings to the ancient branches,\nreturning to the womb by its own constancy.\"*\nThe spirit stirs the Great Void,\ntreading upon the frost of the celestial heights.\nThe ford’s currents stir a myriad streams,\nwhile hidden concentration lifts the true spirit upward.\nWithout attachment, there is no sorrow—\ngazing from on high, one bows in ascent.\n\nThe scripture begins:\nIn the first chapter, the primordial womb binds long life;\nin the second, the root is severed and the gate of death closed;\nin the third, the hun-soul is born and qi is gathered;\nin the fourth, the spirit-lord gathers qi;\nin the fifth, qi refines the primordial viscera;\nin the sixth, the womb-tree’s stagnation is cut away.\nOnly when the five viscera and six bowels are complete\ndoes the seventh chapter speak of *non-action’s* accomplishment.\n\nYet at the beginning of life, as when founding a dynasty,\nthere are always hardships.\nAfter the seventh stage, one merely maintains what has been achieved.\nThus the ninth chapter simply states:\n*\"Floating clarity clings to the ancient branches,\nreturning to the womb by its own constancy.\"*\nIt awaits only the fulfillment of the lunar cycles\nuntil, grown to maturity,\none’s body harmonizes with the qi of the Nine Heavens.\nThe spirit within is none other than the Three Ones of the Grand Tenuity,\nmerged with the Great Void—\nthus one may tread upon the frost of the celestial heights.\n*\"Treading\"* means *empty travel*.\nThe *Spirit Scripture* says: *\"Treading, I circle the Dark Capital.\"*\n*\"Celestial heights\"* refers to the palaces within heaven.\nThe Lady of Cloud Forest says:\n*\"Dark waves stir the blue-green tides,\nmighty fords stir a myriad streams.\nI gaze upon the Six Voids,\nlonging to wander with my beloved.\"*\nTo ascend the celestial heights,\none must concentrate the mind and congeal the spirit,\nsharing radiance with heaven and earth,\nabiding in constancy with the myriad things.\nYet this concentration of mind and spirit\nbegins with freedom from attachment and sorrow.\n\nThe Lady of the Southern Culmen says:\n*\"From attachment arises sorrow,\nfrom attachment arises fear.\nWithout attachment, there is no sorrow;\nwithout sorrow, there is no fear.\"*\nOnce, a man recited scriptures late at night with deep melancholy,\nyearning for home.\nA Perfected One of the Supreme transformed into an ordinary man\nand asked: *\"Do you often play the zither?\"*\n*\"Yes,\"* he replied.\n*\"What if the strings are slack?\"*\n*\"They do not sound, nor do they grieve.\"*\n*\"And if they are too tight?\"*\n*\"The sound breaks and is harmed.\"*\n*\"Then what if they are neither slack nor tight?\"*\n*\"All notes are harmonious.\"*\nThe Perfected One said: *\"The Dao is the same.\nWhen the mind is well-tempered, the Dao may be attained.\"*\nThus attachment and sorrow\nare the greatest illnesses of the Way.\nHence it is said: *\"Without attachment, there is no sorrow—\ngazing from on high, one bows in ascent.\"*\nThis is what the seeker must devote their heart to.\n\n**Two Hymns of the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate**\n\nThe Great Dao, though without intent,\nmay be sought with feeling.\nI pause my chariot in the empty cavern,\ngazing back at the veiled azure currents.\nBeyond the Three Realms, in purity and brightness,\nI wander the jade capital in solitude.\nWithout the dark impetus of fate,\nwho could grasp the hidden subtleties?\n\nThe Milky Way gleams, clear and vast—\nlooking up and down, all is soft emptiness.\nThe Seven Mysteries scatter the dark night,\nreturning to the womb, flowing with sinking and rising.\nIf one concentrates in hidden stillness,\nthe Yang-nine brings no joy or sorrow.\nWitnessing these meetings and partings,\ntime and again I linger.\nBy forgetting the self, the self endures—\nthe true immortals gather with their kind.\n\nThe hidden subtleties of the dark center,\nthe deep and clear waves of the Han.\nThe passing of ages is like a turning wheel,\nyet the tree’s trunk does not change its boughs.\nWith a tranquil mind, I contemplate the Perfect Truth,\nfollowing the cycles, parting from the web of fate.\nResponse and resonance are ever in accord—\nthe spirit’s ease extends even to the ancestors.\nWandering in stillness, without bounds,\nmyriad thoughts dissolve into the Nine Distances.\nThe flying roots scatter the dark leaves—\nprinciple returns, and there is nothing else.\nEver reciting the jade chapters,\ntheir dark tones pierce the clouds and rosy dawn.\nWhen the *jiashen* flood disaster arrives,\nI rein my wings to the Queen Mother’s abode.\nForever enjoying boundless eternity—\nwho knows how many kalpas have passed?\n\n*Explication of the* Scripture of the Jade Chapters on the Spontaneous Generation of the Spirit in the Nine Heavens *concludes.*",

      "translated_text": "**Jade Explication of the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating the Divine**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Jade Explication of the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating the Divine* (*Dongxuan Lingbao Ziran Jiutian Shengshen Yuzhang Jingjie*).\n**Author:** Daoist Wang Xichao of Mianzhou, Southern Song Dynasty.\n**Volumes:** Three.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Jade Explications Section, Dongxuan Division.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to the Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating the Divine**\n\nForm cannot endure forever; what endures is the *qi* that animates it.\n*Qi* cannot circulate eternally; what ensures its perpetual flow is *jing* as its root.\nWhen these three—form, *qi*, and *jing*—merge as one, the Dao of immortality is not difficult to attain.\n\nThe essentials of the *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating the Divine* are fourfold:\n1. Cherish the form,\n2. Preserve the spirit,\n3. Honor the *qi*,\n4. Secure the root.\n\nThat man possesses form is like a man possessing a house. Though it is a temporary assemblage, how can one allow it to decay and crumble day by day? Thus, there are no people in the world who dwell exposed to the elements.\nMoreover, form is the abode of the hundred spirits, the dwelling of the singular nature, the vessel of clarity and wisdom. The practitioner relies upon it to achieve success, and so must daily cherish the form.\n\nNow, accumulated yang generates spirit, and accumulated yin generates form. Form and spirit cannot be separated even for an instant. When form is sturdy, spirit may linger long; when a house is sturdy, its occupant may dwell long within. If one’s merits remain unfulfilled while the yin-shell withers prematurely, this is ever the affliction of the learner.\nThe foolish, not understanding this, dismiss the outer form as mere husk—eyes and ears perceive it as dust, chaff, or dregs—and thus deem themselves enlightened. Yet when they cast their form into the realm of profit and loss, honor and disgrace, they achieve nothing in their lives. Such people differ from the dead in what way?\nNow, one must not merely cherish the form but ensure that form and spirit work in concert, valuing their union as bone and flesh taking flight together.\n\nOne should not face the wind in summer heat, nor lie upon dampness in summer; sitting too long harms the bones, and labor too long harms the sinews. Extending this principle, in all movement and repose, there is no moment when one should not cherish the form.\nExternally, one should avoid the emaciation of Shan Bao; internally, one should avoid the ailments of Zhang Yi. Beginning with cherishing the form, one ultimately fulfills it—how could this be done carelessly?\n\nWhen form and spirit are as one, never far apart, thus the second essential: preserve the spirit.\nSpirit is the essence of yang, the portion allotted by Heaven. As Zhuangzi said: *\"That which does not depart from essence is called spirit.\"*\nHow does the human spirit descend? It is by mandate that it descends. Thus, in the ninth month, the spirit is arrayed, and the mandate is complete.\nOnce the spirit takes residence, it is like a house with an occupant—beams are raised, doors and windows are carved, seeing and hearing, eating and resting, all proceed from it.\nAt its birth, it startles Heaven and shakes Earth; in its movement, hands grasp and feet walk. Mastering its transformations, whether sitting or standing, perishing or persisting, all serve its purpose.\nYet there are those who employ it their whole lives without understanding it. One day, they suddenly perish, their spirit departing with the rotting corpse like night soil. The spirit does not wait; at midnight, it bears them away. Such people, in the end, know not what spirit is—how lamentable!\nAs the scripture says: *\"Why do the dead make the spirit weep?\"*\n\nSpirit governs *qi*, hence the third essential: honor the *qi*.\nThe vastness of Heaven and Earth is moved by nothing but *qi*; the radiance of the sun and moon is brightened by nothing but *qi*. All people and the myriad things are likewise discerned through it. Where they differ is only in whether the *qi* is upright or not.\nThe tortoise and crane do not wither because they obtain pure *qi*; the pine and cypress do not wither early because they obtain unyielding *qi*. Only man obtains the correct *qi*, yet does not preserve it wholly.\nAs the scripture says: *\"The Three Qi are the honor of Heaven and Earth; the Nine Qi are the root of the myriad things.\"*\nIf man can preserve the root of the Nine Qi and unite above with the honor of the Three Qi, how supremely valuable is this! The affliction lies in not knowing it.\nPeople merely honor *qi* without knowing its origin—is this not shallow?\n*Qi* is originally born of *jing*, and *jing* is stored in the kidneys. Thus, one knows that *qi* takes *jing* as its root. Knowing its root, one may then speak of attaining destiny.\n\nThus, the fourth essential: secure the root.\nAs the scripture says: *\"The teeming myriad things each return to their root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of destiny.\"*\nThe practitioner must guard stillness, and only then will the root deepen and the stem be firm.\nThus, Zhuangzi said: *\"Do not disturb your essence, and you may attain long life.\"*\nWhen form is sustained by spirit, and spirit is made numinous by *qi*, one may return to the origin and refine the elixir. This is to unite in virtue with the Three Origins and align with the Nine Qi.\n\nNow, the *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating the Divine* is a forbidden text of the August Highest Heaven, transmitted not by the turning of kalpas but by no cause at all. It aims to overturn the prevailing customs of inversion and guide people toward the realm of benevolence and longevity, awakening those who have not yet understood.\nAbove, it expounds the Three Treasures, enlightening Heaven, Earth, man, and the myriad things, all of which receive nurturance.\nNext, it unfolds the Nine Chapters, establishing the Nine Heavens.\nMan receives the Nine Qi as the origin of life; the head mirrors the Nine Heavens, the upper regions array the Nine Palaces, the body conceals the Nine Treasuries to emulate the Nine Provinces, and the outer openings correspond to the Nine Fields. In the functioning of the body, how could it be apart from the Nine Qi?\nThose who fully employ them ascend to the Nine Heavens; those who employ them secondarily attain liberation through the corpse; those who do not know their use merely receive a single form, wandering as if borrowing *qi*.\nThis Dao is possessed by all, yet why can they not attain it? Because private desires prevail and worldly affairs distract.\nIn the era of the Three Sovereigns, the people were simple and affairs were few. The Great Dao was not concealed, and all knew the essentials of cultivating the body. Thus, there were those who, weary of the world at twelve hundred years, ascended on high.\nAs the scripture says: *\"In high antiquity, there were perfected ones who grasped Heaven and Earth, held yin and yang, breathed essence and *qi*, stood alone and preserved spirit, their flesh and muscles as one. Thus, they could live as long as Heaven and Earth, without end.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Since the calamity of the Qin fires, the books of the Three Sovereigns have been lost to the world, leaving only the *Classic of Difficulties* and the *Basic Questions* as the study of physicians. Thus, the preface to these texts states: \"The books of the Three Sovereigns spoke of the Great Dao, but in later ages, they were utterly lost.\" Though the methods of cultivating the body and nurturing life have persisted like a thread unbroken, Buddhism later spread into China, teaching joy in extinction and stillness. Yet by severing the arm to point the way, it strayed ever further from the root, and the learning of our Great Dao grew ever more obscure.\n\nRecently, upon returning to the southeast, I spoke with a worthy man of my hometown, Master Ren, who said: \"The *Scripture of the Divine Chapters on the Generation of Spirit* is truly the great origin of Daoist teachings, yet many merely skim its surface. Though Jade Toad Master once provided annotations, his words were concise and essential, leaving scholars struggling to grasp their depth. If one were to expound upon it in detail, making it accessible to all, it would not be without benefit.\" His words resonated with me, and in the intervals of my devotions, I resolved to apply what I have learned.\n\nIn former times, Master Ouyang Wenzhong held no fondness for Daoist learning throughout his life, yet in his later years, while governing Bozhou, he began to perceive its truths. One day, he sought instruction from the hermit of Stone Pond, expressing his desire to study. The hermit replied: \"Your house is already in ruins; it is difficult to speak of such matters again. If you can merely clarify what lies before you, it may yet suffice.\" Master Ouyang’s virtue, writings, and renown stood peerless in his age—how could he lack the capacity to receive the Dao? Yet even he was said to have lost the morning light, barely attaining clarity of the present. How much more so for those whose capacity falls short of his? Those who attain this Dao ascend nine generations of ancestors to transcendence—what concern is there for the present? To stubbornly invite hardship or to yield and invite constraint—can one not strive?\n\nWritten on the first day of the fifth month in the first year of the Kaixi reign of the Great Song, by Wang Xichao Yinxian, Daoist of Chongxu Abbey in Mianzhou.\n\n*Explication of the* Scripture of the Divine Chapters on the Natural Generation of Spirit from the Nine Heavens of the Cavernous Mystery of Numinous Treasure, *Volume One*\n*Explicated by Wang Xichao Yinxian, Daoist of Chongxu Abbey in Mianzhou*\n\nThe Heavenly Treasure Lord is the venerable deity of the Great Cavern, and the Heavenly Treasure Elder is the ancestral *qi* of the Heavenly Treasure Lord. The Elder is the *qi* of the Primal Chaos of the Supreme Jade Void, comprising ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety thousand *qi*. In the first year of the Dragon Han era, this *qi* transformed and gave birth to the Heavenly Treasure Lord, who, when revealing the scriptures, was titled the Supreme Lord of the Great Possession of the Jade Clarity Palace.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; kalpas are the greatest of times. Where there is form, there is number; where there is time, there is change. When numbers are exhausted and times transform, all converges in dissolution—only the Three Clarities’ Most Sagely Ones and the Nine Heavens’ True Kings are unbound by form or constrained by number. Thus, they endure through kalpa after kalpa, ageless beyond the posterior heavens.\n\nThe Heavenly Treasure Lord is the ancestor of the myriad Dao, known as the Venerable Deity of the Great Cavern. Thus, among the Three Caverns of the teachings, there is the method of the Great Cavern, which expounds the Dao of revolving winds and primordial fusion—a path not for the comprehension of lesser immortals. Within the human body, he is the Supreme One Emperor Lord.\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of the Great Cavern of Supreme Clarity*: \"Above, it binds the Three Origins; below, it binds the myriad things. In stillness, it is the body; in movement, it is the spirit.\" The Elder is also called the Father of Fathers. The Three Origins are: first, the Primal Chaos of the Supreme Non-Being; second, the Crimson Chaos of the Supreme Non-Being; and third, the Dark and Tranquil Mystery-Pervading Origin.\n\nThe *Scripture of Orthodox Unity* states: \"The Supreme Non-Being transforms, and the Three *Qi* become manifest.\" The Supreme Non-Being is the unbegun beginning; the Three Origins are the root of creation’s inception. Rooted in non-being and begun in origin, the Three *Qi* are thus generated. The name \"Origin Beginning\" is derived from this. Therefore, the Three Origins give rise to the Three *Qi*, and the Three *Qi* are the natural *qi* of the Great Void. The Void is born of the Profound; the Profound is born of the Origin; the Origin is born of the Beginning. Thus, the *Scripture of the Opening of Heaven* says: \"When the primordial *qi* moved, Heaven and Earth were established.\"\n\nThough the Three *Qi* are generated, they have not yet been delimited, and so are called the Primal Chaos. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: \"The Crimson Writ of Primal Chaos, the Non-Ultimate True Ones, the Enlightened Ancestral Kalpa, who transform and give birth to the various heavens.\" The Three *Qi* of the Three Origins’ palaces are the original essences of water and fire, corresponding below to the human body’s heart palace and the two kidneys. In Heaven, they govern the Northern Dipper and the talismanic covenants of numinous writ. If one cultivates the Dao and preserves authenticity, with merit and virtue complete, these Three Spirits ascend together with oneself—this is the Dao of primordial fusion.\n\nThe Three Spirits are Generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou. In the Zhihe era, Emperor Renzong fell ill and remained unconscious for three days. When he briefly recovered, he recounted dreaming of wandering through thorns, lost and bewildered, when a divine figure in golden armor addressed him: \"Heaven, seeing Your Majesty’s transformative heart, grants you twelve more years of life.\" The Emperor asked, \"How shall I return?\" The divine figure replied, \"I shall send you with my chariot.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Emperor mounted the chariot and asked the divine figure’s name. The reply came: \"I am the one called General Ge.\" Upon awakening, the Emperor ordered a search of the *Daoist Canon*, where indeed General Ge was found—overseer of the Heavenly Gate. His rank was elevated, and a temple was established for him in the capital. Yet at that time, no one memorialized the throne to recognize him as the spirit dwelling within the body.\n\nThe qi of Jade Clarity is fundamentally one. Thus, the three titles are identical in essence. Within the Canon, there are designations such as Jade Clarity and Jade Emperor—these are honorifics. \"Jade\" signifies virtue, while \"Emperor\" denotes Heaven. The first kalpa of the Dragon-Han era marks the primordial kalpa. \"Dragon\" embodies transformation, and \"Han\" signifies vastness. Before Heaven and Earth took form, a single qi spiraled through the Great Void, its body coiling and undulating, its transformations boundless, weaving spirit and refining essence. The Heavenly Perfected One witnessed the kalpa’s inception and named it Dragon-Han. Hence, the *Scripture of Divine Transformations* records that the Three Sovereigns all bore dragon bodies and human heads. At the kalpa’s dawn stood the Dragon Ancestor Great Emperor, and there was also the Star of the Dragon Ancestor. Among the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Dragon-Transformation Brahma-Passage Heavenly Emperor shares this meaning.\n\nThe Numinous Treasure Lord is the revered deity of the Cavern of Mystery, while the Numinous Treasure Venerable One is the ancestral qi of the Numinous Treasure Lord. The Venerable One is the qi of Crimson Chaos, Supreme Non-Being, and Primordial Purple Clarity—comprising ninety-nine quadrillion, nine hundred ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, ninety-nine million qi. Later, at the Dragon-Han kalpa’s unfolding, the Numinous Treasure Lord was transformed into being. After one kalpa, in the first year of the Crimson Brightness era, he revealed scriptures to deliver humanity, assuming the title of Supreme Clarity, Mystic Capital, Jade Metropolis, Seven Treasures, and Purple Tenuity Palace.\n\nJade Clarity is the Heavenly Treasure Lord, Supreme Clarity the Numinous Treasure Lord, and Grand Clarity the Divine Treasure Lord. From this, we know the titles of the Three Treasures: the Heavenly Treasure Lord should be called the revered deity of the Cavern of Perfection. Yet today, he is solely referred to as the revered deity of the Great Cavern, not as the Cavern of Perfection—why? Before the Three Caverns were distinguished, they were collectively named the Great Cavern, just as the Two Modes were undivided and called the Supreme Ultimate. The Great Cavern fundamentally embodies the Dao of revolving wind and primordial fusion—this fusion is the state before the Three Caverns were separated. The Primordial Beginning Dharma King is the sovereign of creation, and the precelestial sages are so named. The Cavern of Perfection emerged only after the Three Caverns were distinguished, and the Primordial Beginning also bears this title. In the present scripture’s intent, \"Great Cavern\" refers to the origin, while \"Numinous Treasure Lord\" refers to the manifestation. According to the *Preface to the Canon’s Various Chapters*: \"The Cavern of Mystery is the origin, while Numinous Treasure is the manifestation\"—this speaks of the manifestation.\n\nThe qi of the Great Cavern originally arose from the Void, flowing into the Cavern of Perfection, then into the Cavern of Mystery. The teachings of the Cavern of Mystery are specifically named Numinous Treasure—they are the foundation of the defined teachings. The so-called \"manifestation\" refers to scriptures. In the first year of the Dragon-Han kalpa, there were no scriptures; only at the kalpa’s unfolding did writing first appear. The *Origins of Daoist Teachings* states: \"Daoist teachings began with the Three Origins, descending from origin to manifestation before unfolding into scriptures and instructions.\" Now, the Numinous Treasure Lord was born at the dawn of the Dragon-Han kalpa’s unfolding and fully revealed scriptures at the beginning of humanity’s deliverance. Observing his title and era, we know he is the progenitor of the teachings. He is also titled the Primordial Capital, Jade Metropolis, Seven Treasures, and Purple Tenuity Palace—the repository of the Canon.\n\nYet the supreme qi of Jade Clarity culminates at ninety-nine quadrillion, nine hundred ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion qi. Upon reaching the qi of Crimson Chaos and Supreme Non-Being, it already lacks billions of qi. Thus, we know the kalpic cycles and qi allotments differ, no longer as they once were—this is humanity’s self-invited consequence. In high antiquity, there were those who lived for millions of years; even in the Tang and Yu eras, lifespans exceeded a hundred. Today, people barely reach seventy—how can the present differ so from the past? All receive the same qi, so why the disparity? The cycles of life and death proceed: birth is followed by extinction, extinction by rebirth. Wisdom and perception gradually dim, and qi is depleted. The present falls short of the past, and the future will fall short of the present. Like a measure of water poured repeatedly into different vessels, each transfer loses droplets until it no longer fills the measure. As days and months pass, its drying is inevitable. Thus, the cycles of life and death turn like a wheel, never pausing—deeply lamentable.\n\nThe Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, taking life and death as their duty, braved prohibitions to earnestly petition, enabling people to know the root of generating spirit, escape the turning wheel, and ultimately return to the immortal Dao. Their intent is truly profound. Having attained human form, one must not recklessly traverse life and death. Instead, one should reflect inward and reverse the light to avoid losing oneself to other realms—only then may one still hope for the immortal Dao.\n\nThe Divine Treasure Lord is the revered deity of the Cavern of Spirits, while the Divine Treasure Venerable One is the ancestral qi of the Divine Treasure Lord. The Venerable One is the qi of Dark Stillness, Mystic Penetration, Primordial Non-Being, and Supreme Clarity—comprising ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million qi. Later, in the first year of the Crimson Brightness era, the Divine Treasure Lord was transformed into being. After two kalpas, in the first year of the Supreme Sovereign era, he revealed scriptures, assuming the title of the Three Sovereigns, Cavern of Spirits, Grand Clarity, and Supreme Ultimate Palace.\n\nMaster Jade Toad Zhao posited that Jade Clarity corresponds to the Metal Palace, Supreme Clarity to the Fire Palace, and Grand Clarity to the Earth Palace—but omitted Wood and Water. Scholars have long doubted this theory without seeking its underlying principle. Yet among the Five Phases, Metal is primary. Metal itself is without qi, but it nurtures qi in the Thunder (Zhen) direction—Wood. Metal also restrains Wood, embodying the principle of husband and wife, and generates Water, embodying the bond of mother and child. Of the Five Substances, only Metal remains uncorrupted: it does not scorch in fire, does not moisten in water, does not harm in earth, and does not damage in wood. When the perfected comprehend this to refine the elixir, they seek correspondences among Metal, Fire, and Earth—while Water and Wood naturally align without contrivance. An ancient immortal poem states: \"The Five Phases are complete in Earth; the Four Images do not depart from Metal.\"\n\nThe ancestral qi of the Three Treasure Lords originates from the Three Origins. Now, examining the scriptural texts, the \"Dark Stillness and Mystic Penetration\" passage omits the character *lou* (leak)—this is not unique to the Shu edition but appears everywhere.",

      "translated_text": "The *Nine Heavens’ Chapters on the Generation of Spirits* underwent collation by the imperial minister Wang Qinruo of our present dynasty, yet even so, such errors persist—how much more so for the various scriptures? Moreover, *Taiyi’s Trial Vision* is mistakenly rendered as *Taiyi’s Precept Vision*, and similar instances abound.\n\nThe *qi* of *Hundun Supreme Non-Being, Primordial Highest Jade Void* is written as the *qi* of *Red Chaos Supreme Non-Being, Non-Supreme Purple Void*. Since the preceding line speaks of the *qi* of *Highest Jade Void*, the phrase *Red Chaos Supreme Non-Being* likely omits a character, and should read simply *Supreme Jade Void qi*. The Heavenly Treasure Lord is titled *Highest*, so the Numinous Treasure Lord ought to be titled *Primordial Supreme*, without the two characters *Non-Supreme*. Yet in *Dark Stillness and Mystic Penetration*, the character *yuan* (primordial) is again omitted, rendering it simply *Non-Supreme Jade Void qi*.\n\nUpon recent collation, it appears that in the *Daoist Canon*, the characters *wu* (non-) and *yuan* (primordial) share similar strokes. It is feared that during early transmission, scribal errors arose from overlapping characters, leading to their omission—or else they were simply left out. How could the *qi* of the Three Origins possess only two origins? Such reasoning is untenable. The character *yuan* should be added beneath *Dark Stillness and Mystic Penetration*, while the phrase *Supreme Jade Void qi* awaits correction by those of discernment. This follows the *Spring and Autumn* principle of transmitting doubts as doubts.\n\nThe Three Origins are expounded in the *Scripture of the Origins of the Three Caverns*. Since entering the Dao, I have often lamented the excessive laxity in teaching lineages, where learning lacks proper masters and errors abound. Even among those who claim understanding, some arrogantly inflate themselves—what is this if not carving and painting the plainest of women?\n\nMoreover, observing the texts circulated in recent generations for fasts and Offerings, one finds frequent inversions of black and white, and the fabrication of non-existent things. Those of insight will perceive this for themselves.\n\nThough these three titles differ across eras, their essence remains one. They divide into the Three *qi* of Mysterious, Primordial, and Origin—governing the Three Treasures—and all are revered spirits of the Three *qi*, titled *Generators of the Three qi*. The Three Titles together generate the Nine *qi*. The Nine *qi* emerge prior to the Great Void, concealed within the Hollow Cavern. Without light, without image; without form, without name; without color, without trace; without sound, without voice.\n\nYi’s craft within the bow’s reach could not prevent self-praise; the Dao, descending to become *qi*, could not prevent the bestowal of names and titles. From One dividing into Three, from Three merging into Nine—though the Three Titles differ, their root is one, converging in unity. When one grasps at them yet cannot hold them, is this not that which is beyond form? When one names and recites them, is this not that which is beneath form?\n\nThe Three Titles are as follows: the Heavenly Treasure Lord, titled *Highest Great Possession, Jade Clarity Palace*; the Numinous Treasure Lord, titled *Supreme Clarity, Jade Capital of the Seven Treasures, Purple Tenuity Palace*; and the Spirit Treasure Lord, titled *Three Sovereigns, Cavern Spirit, Supreme Clarity, Great Ultimate Palace*. The Great Ultimate Palace is one of the Nine Palaces, where immortals who attain the Dao reside. Within its halls, the ranks of Perfected, Great Masters, Dukes, and Ministers each hold their proper place. Though the Three Titles differ, their origin is the single body of the Primordial Beginning.\n\nAt the inception of the Primordial Beginning, before Heaven and Earth existed, the One Body generated the Ten Thousand Beings—hence the title *Great Possession, Jade Clarity Palace*. When the Dragon Han unveiled the Chart and Heaven and Earth first divided, the Numinous Treasure was born within the Western Heaven’s Yuchai Mountain. At that time, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King sat upon Jade Capital Mountain, inhaling celestial *qi* above and drinking earthly springs below. The palaces and halls of Jade Capital Mountain were adorned with the Seven Treasures and gold and jade, with the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace at their center. After the Numinous Treasure Lord’s birth, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King commanded him to preside—hence this title.\n\nDuring the Red Clarity era, at the time of the Three Sovereigns’ division and transformation, the Spirit Treasure Lord was born. This coincided with the descent of the Cavern Spirit—hence the title *Three Sovereigns, Cavern Spirit, Supreme Clarity, Great Ultimate Palace*.\n\nThe Three *qi*—Mysterious, Primordial, and Origin—are as follows: the *Non-Born Mysterious qi*, accumulating purity to form azure; the *Cavern-Generated Primordial qi*, accumulating emptiness to form white; and the *Void-Generated Origin qi*, accumulating light to form yellow. Once the Three *qi* are complete, they merge to generate the Nine *qi*. The Nine *qi* are the single *qi* of Yellow Evolution—these are the Nine *qi*. The Three *qi* all originate from the Three Voids: *Supreme Non-Being* pertains to Jade Clarity, *Great Void* pertains to Supreme Clarity, and *Hollow Cavern* pertains to Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe One *qi* born of *Supreme Non-Being* is called *Great Inception*; emerging prior to the *Great Void*, it is called *Great Beginning*; concealed within the *Hollow Cavern*, it is called *Great Simplicity*. Formerly, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King and the Nine Heavens’ Perfected Kings were born prior to the Nine *qi*. At that time, there were no years or months; each interval of *qi* spanned ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-one thousand *li*, constituting one year.\n\nWhen it emerged prior to the *Great Void* and concealed itself within the *Hollow Cavern*, one could not see its beginning when approaching, nor its end when following. Without light, image, form, name, color, trace, sound, or voice—who could comprehend it? Thus it is said: the Dao’s law is self-so.\n\nThe Dao governs and steers the world, opening and penetrating the Mysterious. The Three Colors intermingled in chaos, now present, now absent. As the revolving numbers reached their limit, the Three *qi* radiated light. *Qi* purified and ascended, accumulating yang to form Heaven; *qi* congealed and settled, accumulating stagnation to form Earth. The Nine *qi* arrayed in order, giving rise to the sun, moon, and stars. Yin and yang, the Five Phases, the people, and the myriad beings all received life and completion.\n\nDoes Heaven revolve? Who presides over it? It must rely on *qi* to revolve. At the moment of Heaven and Earth’s initial separation, the Spirit Treasure Lord governed with the *qi* of *Dark Stillness and Mystic Penetration*, opening and cleaving them. The closing of the gate is called *Kun*; the opening of the gate is called *Qian*. When closed, the Ten Thousand Beings are first enveloped; when opened, the Ten Thousand Beings are first born. This is the Three generating the Ten Thousand Beings.\n\nOnce chaos divided, the Three *qi*—azure, yellow, and white—began to emerge, now present, now absent, without visible form. To say they exist is not truly existence; to say they do not exist is not truly non-existence. Who moves them? When the revolving numbers reach their limit, they stir. Who opens and closes them? When the numbers reach their extremity, they part. Heaven and Earth await this to be established; the sun and moon await this to shine. Thus the Nine *qi* array in order: arrayed, they are orderly and unconfused; aligned, they do not transgress their bounds. Yin and yang, the Five Phases interweave to form sequence; the people and the myriad beings all receive life. What greater achievement is there than this in the work of creation?",
      "overlap_context": "lixir, they seek correspondences among Metal, Fire, and Earth—while Water and Wood naturally align without contrivance. An ancient immortal poem states: \"The Five Phases are complete in Earth; the Four Images do not depart from Metal.\"\n\nThe ancestral qi of the Three Treasure Lords originates from the Three Origins. Now, examining the scriptural texts, the \"Dark Stillness and Mystic Penetration\" passage omits the character *lou* (leak)—this is not unique to the Shu edition but appears everywhere.",

      "translated_text": "Heaven and Earth with their myriad transformations cannot generate life without being nurtured by the Three Origins or guided by the Nine *qi*. The Three *qi* are the honor of Heaven and Earth; the Nine *qi* are the root of the Ten Thousand Beings. Thus, the Three unite to form virtue, the ultimate of Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Qi* arriving at the body is called life; *qi* departing from the body is called death. All things—whether bearing teeth and hair or the tiniest creeping insects—share this without exception. Without nurture from the Three Origins or guidance from the Nine *qi*, none can come to life.\n\nOf all beings, humans are the most numinous, standing as one of the Three Powers among the Ten Thousand Beings—truly exalted. As *Zhuangzi* says, \"Heaven and Earth are born together with me.\" Though all receive life in the same way, once endowed, their actions diverge without bound. Why then is the longevity of Heaven and Earth so vast, while human life is so fleeting? It is because they do not comprehend the principle of the Three uniting to form virtue, the ultimate of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThis \"ultimate\" is the Center. As the *Zuo Tradition of the Spring and Autumn Annals* states, \"Humans receive the Center to establish their destiny.\" The *Book of Documents* says, \"The Supreme Lord bestows the *zhong* upon the people below\"—this is the Yellow Court of Daoist teachings. \"Yellow\" is the color of Earth; \"Court\" is the Center of the Four Directions.\n\nHeaven’s One generates Water, which in humans becomes essence, stored in the kidneys. The kidneys have left, right, and a central channel. The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: \"On the left is Lesser Yang, on the right Greater Yin; behind is the Secret Gate, before is the Gate of Life.\" Since the kidneys are the gate of life and death, the work of nurturing must begin with the Yellow Court.\n\nWithin the kidneys, essence is stored; from essence, *qi* is born. When *qi* and the heart unite, heart-fluid and *qi* intermingle, refined in the Yellow Court. If one knows how to unite them without error, then essence merges with *qi*, *qi* with spirit, and spirit with the Dao. Thus the principle of ceaseless generation does not lose the Center of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the Three unite to form virtue, the ultimate of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen humans receive life in the womb, the Three Origins nurture them, and the Nine *qi* shape their form. After nine months, the spirits are arrayed, *qi* fills the body, and sound is produced. The voice is still joined to the spirit, and the Nine Heavens rejoice. The Great One holds the talisman; the Thearch assigns rank; the Registrar inscribes the record; the Director of Destinies fixes the allotted years; the Five Thearchs oversee birth; the Holy Mother guards the chamber; celestial and terrestrial spirits, along with the Three Realms, all stand guard.\n\nThe Marshal of the Nine Heavens stands in the courtyard, facing east, reciting the *Precious Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Birth of the Spirits* nine times. If the child is male, the myriad spirits chant \"Reverence\"; if female, they chant \"Obedience.\" If male, the Director of Destinies responds with respect; if female, with compliance. Only then is the child born. If the Marshal of the Nine Heavens does not issue the command, and the myriad spirits do not chant their responses, birth does not occur.\n\nAccording to the *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir*: Humans receive life from the celestial soul, congeal through the primordial spirit, revolve through the Nine *qi*, and are endowed with destiny by the Great One. The Three Paths open, and spirit accumulates in the Dark Palace. Thus, the mysterious fluid coils sevenfold, flowing with moisture and spreading its grace. The sun and moon illuminate the Six Voids; the mouth and eyes move the spirit-vessels. Clouds drift and rain falls—virtue rivals Heaven and Earth. Within the womb, the Five Causes come together.\n\nThe Way of establishing humans is thus of such weight. The Five Causes are the Five Spirits; the Three Paths are the Three Perfected. The Five Spirits are the soul of Heaven; the Three Perfected are the Dao of Heaven; the Nine *qi* are the embryo of Heaven; the Great One is the source of Heaven; the sun and moon are the eyes of Heaven; the mysterious fluid is the moisture of Heaven; the Six Voids are the light of Heaven; the Dark Palace is the treasury of Heaven; spirit and *qi* are the transformations of Heaven; the primordial spirit is the mutation of the Thearch.\n\nIt is also said: The Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother— the Primordial Father governs *qi*, regulating the Thearch’s governance; the Mysterious Mother governs essence, transforming and congealing the womb. The Great One blends them together; the Five Spirits bear the register; talismans are arrayed for the Five Spirits, each with its own charge.\n\nThus, the Three Offices guard the Perfected; the hundred joints receive the numinous. The Thearch fixes the register, and the destined life stands firm. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders raise the body and usher in the dawn.\n\nUpon close examination, the meaning of this passage aligns closely with the *Birth of the Spirits Chapters*. What is called \"receiving life in the womb, nurtured by the Three Origins, shaped by the Nine *qi*\" is the Mysterious Mother generating essence, transforming and congealing the womb, revolving the Nine *qi*, and the Three Paths of spirit. \"After nine months, the spirits are arrayed, *qi* fills the body, and sound is produced\" corresponds to \"the sun and moon illuminating the Six Voids, the mouth and eyes moving the spirit-vessels.\" \"The Nine Heavens rejoice, the Great One holds the talisman, the Thearch assigns rank, the Registrar inscribes the record, the Director of Destinies fixes the allotted years, the Five Thearchs oversee birth\" through to \"birth does not occur\" corresponds to \"the Great One blending them together, the Five Spirits bearing the talismans, the Thearch fixing the register, the destined life standing firm, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders raising the body and ushering in the dawn.\"\n\nAccording to the *Mirror of the Mysterious*: The Great One is the great master of long life. In the teachings, there are the Great One Thearch, the Great One Perfected Lord, the Great One Primordial Lord, the Great One Perfected Person, and the Great One Venerable Spirit. This Great One is not an external deity but the Great One of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern. His form resembles a newly born male, unclothed, four inches in height—the spirit of the Great Cavern’s returned womb, the first form. His name is *Wuyoushou*, and he constantly guards beneath the human jade pillow. At the moment of human birth, he holds the talisman and blends the myriad spirits.\n\nThe Thearch is also called the Seven Numinous Ones or the Spirit Elder. He constantly guards above the human brows, determining the rank of destiny. The Director of Destinies is the Central Elder, guarding the human heart and fixing the allotted years. The Five Thearchs are: the Azure Thearch at the Eastern Ridge, the Vermilion Thearch at the Long Awakening, the White Thearch at Peng’s Peace, the Black Thearch at Preserving Completion, and the Yellow Thearch at Containing Radiance—they oversee human birth. The Holy Mother is the Holy Mother of the Nine Heavens. Since solitary yang does not generate and solitary yin does not complete, the Holy Mother is the master of utmost yin, delighting in bringing life to completion. She guards the chamber, warding off misfortune.",

      "translated_text": "The Master of Ceremonies who stands in the courtyard facing east to recite the *Chapter of Generating Spirits* is none other than the Grand Master of Longevity, the Great Marshal. His surname is Bocheng, his given name Xusheng, and he is a Perfected One of the Highest Clarity. When men respectfully assent and chant with reverence, and women respectfully comply and chant with devotion, distinctions of noble and base are thereby made—much like the difference between jade scepters and clay tiles in poetry.\n\nAll the spirits mentioned above are the gods of one’s own body. When the moment is right and the qi is full, the hundred spirits assemble together. Now, the spirits regard qi as their mother, and the spirits are the children of qi. If the spirits can abide in qi, and qi can retain the form, then longevity and enduring vision present no difficulty. Alas, people do not understand this, extinguishing their lives through desire and trivializing existence through profit—how deeply lamentable!\n\nWhen a person is reborn into the human realm, washing their form in the Great Yang, it shakes heaven and earth, a dignity too great to surpass. The celestial perfected, earthly spirits, and the Three Realms all descend together—such is not taken lightly. At the time of birth, it is not to be deemed mean. Therefore, one who can cherish their form, preserve their spirit, honor their qi, and secure their root will never perish or decay but attain transcendence, their bones and flesh ascending together to the Three Clarities. This is to unite virtue with the Three Qi and align with the Nine Qi.\n\nYet people, having obtained life, fail to revere their qi, honor their form, preserve their life, or cherish their spirit, bringing about their own decay and separation from their original truth. The *Mystic Origin’s Veiled Charge* states: “Born between heaven and earth, humans receive the harmony of the Two Qi, crown the myriad creatures, dwell in the most numinous place, and gather the essence of the Five Phases. They partake in the Three Powers, standing alongside heaven and earth—truly the most noble without peer. If one attains a human body, one should cherish and protect it, for the boundary between life and death is fraught with delusion. The human body is like standing on a plank while a ball rolls beneath; attaining a human body is like boarding a boat against the current. This is why the Divine King, in his earnest concern, pities sentient beings for their unawareness, their disregard for life, and their submission to death. They do not value the human body and thus raise this question.\n\nOnce a human body is attained, it must proceed to the Southern Cinnabar Fire-Refining Pool, where it is cleansed with the Yellow Flower’s waters before entering the womb to become a person. Now, this scripture speaks of washing the form in the Great Yang rather than the Yellow Flower—why? The Yellow Flower is the essence of yang, the upper abode of the sun, also called the Cavern Yang Palace. Within it lies the Flowing Fire Pool, containing the Yellow Flower’s waters. Divine beings constantly bathe their forms in these waters, which is why our teachings, when recommending the deceased, employ the *Longevity Talisman*, pointing to this.\n\nSince becoming human involves so many stages, it is truly what shakes heaven and earth, with the Three Realms descending together—hardly a mean affair. Each time I recite this passage, I close the scroll and sigh deeply. This body stands alongside heaven and earth, its qi communicating with yin and yang. This body is the body of the Three Treasures, this qi the qi of yin and yang. Nothing is more venerable than the Three Treasures, no spirit greater than yin and yang. When their mechanism is set in motion, the myriad things transform accordingly—so how could it not shake heaven and earth, with the Three Realms descending together? Such is no exaggeration.\n\nHaving attained this life, one cannot but rejoice—how could it be taken lightly? Yet people do not cherish their form, preserve their spirit, honor their qi, or secure their root to unite virtue with the Three Qi and align with the Nine Qi. This is entirely because selfish desires prevail while wisdom is lacking. How many are like those who would use Marquis Sui’s pearl to shoot a sparrow a thousand fathoms high? Such people are everywhere—how could they not lose their original truth?\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Chapter of Generating Spirits* is the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, where three coalesce to form sound and congeal into numinous script. It blends the hundred spirits and conceals their inner names, generating qi to structure form—this is the *Chapter of Spontaneity*. The vastness of heaven and earth cannot move without qi; the human body cannot stand without qi; the Three Caverns’ sacred scriptures cannot take form without qi. That it is called the *Chapter of Spontaneity* means it does not originate from human speech.\n\nAccording to the *Twelve Disciplines of the Great Perfected*, the spontaneous original text is primary, being the teaching of prior heaven. The Nine Heavens’ Elder told the Three Heavens’ Jade Lads: “The *Record in the Cinnabar Womb’s Essence* states that at the inception of generating mystery, the qi of the Great Void’s spontaneity congealed to form sacred script—this is the present *Chapter of Generating Spirits*.” The Flying Mystery refers to the fact that among the Three Qi, the mysterious qi is ultimate. Its qi is like clouds, drifting and circling in the Great Void, coalescing only after threefold union to produce sound.\n\nThis threefold union, as the *Scripture of Origins* states: “The human form is one, the body is two, and qi is three. Only when form, body, spirit, and qi are complete does a person come into being.” Alternatively, spirit is one, qi is two, and essence is three—only then is a spirit formed. Or heaven is one, earth is two, and humanity is three—only then are the Dao and virtue of heaven and earth complete. Thus it is said that three coalesce to form sound. “Sound” refers to harmonious tones, as in this very chapter.\n\nScripture is congealed by qi, spirits are united by qi, and like attracts like—hence it is said to blend the hundred spirits. Moreover, in the Upper Prime Palace of the Purple Tenuity, there is a talisman for extending life. When placed in the eight directions, the qi of the eight directions responds in an instant, and all become human. When the talisman is concealed again, they revert to qi. Blending returns all to one body, which is why the *Scripture of Salvation* states: “The Perfected blend without division, and the celestial qi returns to one body.” All is the spontaneous qi.\n\nReciting the *Celestial Treasure* opens the light of heaven and earth. Reciting the *Numinous Treasure* opens the souls of the Nine Darks’ long night. Reciting the *Spirit Treasure* governs the myriad spirits. Reciting the *Great One* equips the body’s spirits. Reciting the *Thearch* structures the form. Reciting the *Nine Heavens* generates humanity. Reciting as a scholar ascends to heaven. The Dao is not distant from humanity—it is humanity that distances itself from the Dao. When heaven and humanity unite, there is originally no separation.",

      "translated_text": "Pursuing this by principle, the Celestial Treasure is the Primordial Beginning, the Numinous Treasure is the Lord of the Dao, and the Spirit Treasure is the Venerable Lord. The Celestial Treasure arose at the dawn of Dragon Han, when heaven and earth first divided—above, no further hue; below, no further abyss—only the vast expanse of primordial chaos, boundless and lightless. The Lord of the Celestial Treasure, by the spontaneous generation of the Jade Chapters of Divine Manifestation, opened and ordered it, so that above and below took their places. Thus the *Scripture of Salvation through the Crossing of All* states: “Where there is no script, there is no illumination.”\n\nThe Lord of the Numinous Treasure arose at the inception of the Dragon Han’s unfolding chart, becoming the first to deliver humanity. Hence it is said to open the souls of the Nine Darks’ long night. The *Scripture of Salvation through the Crossing of All* states: “Where there is no script, there is no deliverance.”\n\nThe Lord of the Spirit Treasure arose in the first year of Vermilion Brightness, when the myriad patterns were already arrayed, the Great Void nurtured the wondrous, and the great image radiated numinosity. From the qi of yang essence were transformed the lofty perfected and exalted immortals; from the qi of tranquil emptiness were transformed the Primordial Lords and Holy Mothers; from the qi of unyielding vigor were transformed the Heavenly Soldiers and Mighty Warriors; and from the remaining qi were nurtured the myriad spirits. Thus it is said to govern the myriad spirits. The *Scripture of Salvation through the Crossing of All* states: “The five scripts unfold the expanse, universally engendering divine spirits.” To govern is to ensure they wield no reckless power.\n\nSpeaking of the body: the qi of the Lord of the Celestial Treasure resides in the Mud-Pill Palace, its spirit issuing from the eyes as light. Thus it is said to open the light of heaven and earth. The qi of the Lord of the Numinous Treasure resides in the Crimson Palace, which is the numinous repository born of blood. Blood is yin, stored in the liver, and the liver governs the hun-soul. Thus it is said to open the souls of the long night. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: “For me, block and seal the Gate of Death, so that the Jade Flower of the Thearch may secure my Cinnabar Prime’s domain. Unbind the seven generations of ancestral souls in darkness, ascending them to the Southern Palace.”\n\nThe qi of the Lord of the Spirit Treasure resides in the Lower Cinnabar Field, which is the Yellow Court—the repository of spirit generation. The scripture states: “Dispersing transforms the five forms, transmuting into the myriad spirits.” This is called the “Inner Chapter” of the Yellow Court. Thus it is said to govern the myriad spirits. The Great One unites all spirits, which is to say, it gathers and restrains them. The Thearch is the Meeting of the Brahma-Realm. All the above are the spirits of the one body, explained in detail below.\n\nOnce the form is structured, the four limbs and five constituents are all complete. In the ninth month, the spirits are arrayed, and one is about to become human. If a scholar of the Dao understands this principle, the Three Officials become the Three Treasures, and the Nine Heavens converge as one. Thus one will never perish or decay, ascending to the Nine Heavens. How could the Dao be distant from humanity? Cease your inaction.\n\nWhen ghostly spirits hear this, they ascend and are promoted. When ordinary people hear this, they attain longevity. When souls in darkness hear this, they are delivered and opened. When withered and decayed things hear this, they emit smoke. When infants hear this, they can speak. When dead remains hear this, they return to being human.\n\nFrom the Celestial Treasure to the scholar: those who attain our Dao become emperors above and kings below. From ghostly spirits to dead remains: those who lose our Dao see light above and become earth below. Yet there is a distinction between reciting and merely hearing. Those who recite attain the Dao—like reciting the words of Yao and practicing the conduct of Yao. Now, alas, failing to attain the Dao, one falls among ghostly spirits, ordinary people, and souls in darkness, far removed from the Dao. Yet if one day they return to hear this scripture: those among ghostly spirits may ascend and be promoted, their names entering the Eastern Florescence, no longer subject to the Three Officials’ ghosts.\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of the Flying Immortal’s Precious Sword*: “Those with talents resembling the worthy and surpassing the multitude, though they die and are recorded by the Three Officials as good and bright ghosts, must wait four hundred years to become rulers of the underworld. From there, they advance one rank every three hundred years.” Yet upon hearing this scripture, they need not wait for the appointed time to ascend and be promoted.\n\nOrdinary people possess all six desires and are called “near-men.” Upon hearing this scripture, the six desires no longer defile them, and they enjoy long life in the world. Souls in darkness are those imprisoned in the earthly dungeons. Upon hearing this scripture, they are delivered to the ranks of the Southern Palace.\n\nThe withered and decayed are plants and trees. Once withered and decayed, their substance no longer remains. Yet how can they emit smoke upon hearing this scripture? This scripture is composed of flying mystery-qi, structured into numinous script. The plants and trees of the world are born of qi. When they emit smoke, smoke is the qi of wood. Within wood lies fire; when substance is present, fire ignites. Now, though withered and decayed, their principle of life is gone. Yet when they encounter this scripture, qi nourishes them, gradually restoring their vital substance. Thus it is said that the withered and decayed emit smoke upon hearing it. If one analogizes to humans, it is the loss of spirit.\n\nThe refined is the withered and decayed thing; smoke is like a person’s qi. If qi no longer remains, is this not a withered and decayed thing? Thus Su Dongpo, harmonizing with Yuanming’s *Poems on Form and Shadow*, wrote: “You are like fire upon smoke; when the fire is spent, you depart.” Only upon reaching this point in the scripture does one realize the wondrous efficacy of the divine, which admits no separation from things.\n\nFormerly, Chongyang said: “One who possesses the Dao carries a gourd, within which is the Great Elixir, mixed with grains. He gives it freely to others. By day’s end, the grains are gone, but the elixir remains. He then says: ‘How meager is the world’s good fortune!’ Thereupon, he leaves the Great Elixir on the withered sea-palm at the Jade Bureau and departs. The next day, he sees the sea-palm revived, the withered and decayed emitting smoke. Is this not the same principle?”\n\nInfants can cry but cannot speak. Upon hearing this scripture, they gain speech, for their orifices open and their faculties sharpen. Dead remains are those whose hun and po souls have each departed, far removed from the human way. Upon hearing this scripture, they return to being human. Formerly, Xu Jia had already died, passing many years. One day, the Venerable Lord cast the Talisman of Great Mystery upon him, reviving him. That was by the power of the talisman; this is by the power of the scripture—different paths converging in the same end.\n\nThe Three Treasures are the profound mystery, the root of the myriad beings. Thus they are not known by ghosts and spirits, nor heard by ordinary people.",

      "translated_text": "The Three Treasures are the Heavenly Treasure, the Numinous Treasure, and the Divine Treasure. They give birth to Heaven and Earth, empower ghosts and gods, emperors and lords. Utterly quiescent yet unchanging, utterly pure yet unadulterated, they cover the vastness of Heaven and Earth without omission, conceal the depths of ghosts and spirits beyond all description. The ten thousand kinds teem and transform without cease, unfathomable—truly they may be called the profound mystery.\n\nThus the scripture says: “The Dao/Way is the mystery of the myriad things.” The Three Treasures are the mystery within the mystery. “Mystery” is the deep and secluded place, the source of the Great Root and Great Ancestor.\n\nThe *Canon of Supreme Mystery* says: “The mystery of Heaven lies in the northwest, where essence transforms in dense abundance. The mystery of Earth lies in the Yellow Springs, where the po soul is concealed and nurtured. The mystery of Man lies in thought, where the utmost spirit is stored.”\n\nThe *Scripture of Southern Florescence* says: “Auspiciousness arises from the mystery.” The old commentary takes “wei” as the mystery, meaning Kun. Here, the *Canon of Supreme Mystery* points to the Yellow as Kun. The qi of Great Brahmā arises from the northwest; all living things turn to it for sustenance—this is the Dao/Way of establishing Heaven. The po soul is nurtured in Kun, and the ten thousand kinds all flourish—this is the Dao/Way of establishing Earth. Once Heaven and Earth are established, yin and yang are complete. That which is born cannot but be born; that which transforms cannot but transform. Thus it is said: the Three Treasures are the profound mystery, the root of the myriad beings.\n\nEarlier it was said that ghosts and spirits hear this and ascend, while ordinary people hear it and attain longevity. Now it is said that they are not known by ghosts and spirits, nor heard by ordinary people. Before ghosts and spirits knew it, before ordinary people had heard it, and after they have known and heard it—these are not the same, and cannot be spoken of in the same breath.\n\nThose who attain this Dao/Way cannot be fully explicated. How could it be grasped by the commonplace hearing of the world? The utmost words cannot be casually obtained; the Dao/Way of immortals and transcendents is rare indeed.\n\nThose who study the supreme Dao/Way, yearning for immortals and transcendents, may achieve liberation through the corpse when their power and capacity are shallow, unable to ascend with their bones. This is called “extinction and turning the wheel.” If the turning of the wheel has not ceased, the root of life and death remains, and one is not free from the cycle of the six destinies.\n\nThus the Azure Lad said:\n*“To plant the root of extinction,*\n*Uproot the seed of life and death.*\n*Lamenting, you sink into the nine springs—*\n*All for cherishing the bodily frame.”*\n\nThe seed of life and death is the turning wheel. If one enters the turning wheel, one may stray from the human way and find it difficult to regain a human form. If even a human form is hard to regain, how much more so for those who yearn for immortals and transcendents?\n\nYet this scripture speaks of liberation through the corpse as a means to escape the turning wheel and ultimately join the immortal Dao/Way. However, if one’s merit and conduct are not yet full, one’s name remains in the ghostly registers, and one is not free from the pursuit of the Three Offices. Thus, one temporarily lodges the form in the clefts of cliffs and the depths of valleys, where the Great Unity guards the corpse, the three hun souls tend the bones, the seven po souls protect the flesh, and the embryonic spirit binds the qi. Over time, one is reborn.\n\nMoreover, the Dao/Way of liberation through the corpse has many methods: ingesting the elixir knife and worms flow out; rinsing with the flow of the embryo and dying in stages; drinking jade nectar and knocking on the coffin; consuming the golden elixir and announcing the end. Some leave their heads in one place and their bodies in another; some shed their bodies while their hair remains. In general, this is because their cultivation in a single lifetime was not complete. Thus, the Immortal Duke attained perfection after seven generations, and the Supreme Ultimate achieved fruition after a hundred bodies.\n\nOnce one has achieved liberation through the corpse, one employs the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* to secure the bodily form. Then the vital fluids do not dry up, and the gates of death close. The *Scripture of Arrayed Records* says: “The reason a human body decays and rots is that there are thirty-nine places where it receives ghostly qi. The form has interstices, the blood has deficiencies, the dead qi advances daily, and perverse qi is drawn in. The spirit and essence do not circulate, the fluids stagnate, and the hundred spirits flee.” Thus the scripture speaks of the dead qi fixing the root, the true radiance not being preserved, and the vital qi lacking its springs.\n\nThe “true radiance” is the true spirit. To merely receive a single form, drifting along as if borrowing qi—though one has this body, if one does not understand the Dao/Way of generating the spirit, how is this different from a walking corpse?\n\nIf one attains this method, one may sit and govern the natural. This refers specifically to the *Scripture of Generating the Spirit* as a shortcut, bypassing liberation through the corpse and directly entering the Great Vehicle.\n\nWhere is this method found? The scripture says:",

      "translated_text": "The *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating the Spirit* is the flying mystery-qi of the Three Caverns, the threefold harmony that forms sound and coalesces into numinous script. It blends the hundred spirits as one. Within the human body, nothing is not born of these three qi. Once one receives this qi, one unites with the Primordial Beginning, thereby merging with the hundred spirits—where qi resides, spirit follows.\n\nAt first, the three qi generate the three spirits; the three divisions and eight luminaries become the twenty-four spirits. If one constantly merges with the twenty-four spirits, one transforms into the Three-Five Perfected, coalescing into the Orthodox Unity and uniting as the Thearch Lord. Though their number be a hundred thousand myriad millions, one may still merge with them. Thus yang summons yin, and they move without fixed direction. Yang qi transforms into dragon chariots, yin qi becomes jade maidens, dancing upon the wheels of the empty mystery, seated to attain spontaneity—how could this be deception?\n\nThe Three Treasures are revered, the Nine Heavens’ Perfected are supreme. The secrecy is profound, sealed within ninefold golden lattices and the Purple Yang Jade Terrace. Unless heaven and earth are newly opened, its text does not emerge. It is the Primordial Beginning’s forbidden scripture, not for the hearing of ghosts and spirits. Whoever steals it suffers the wind-blades for ten thousand kalpas, their souls dying without rebirth. Those who uphold the precepts and revere it attain immortality in both form and spirit.\n\nThe sagely heart of aiding beings knows no end, yet it abides above the myriad heavens—who in the world could know it? Thus the scriptures of the Three Caverns are disseminated among humanity, for they are none other than the sagely heart’s voice. To recite this scripture now is to attain that heart, and through that heart to commune with all sages. Since the scripture exists, the sages exist as well—how could it not be revered?\n\nThe *Scripture of Generating the Spirit* is the ancestral qi of heaven and earth, the parent of all living beings. Even the Three Treasures hold it in reverence—how much more should humans? In the Six Caverns of Fengdu’s palaces, there is a special tribunal for the crime of slandering the Mahāyāna of the Three Treasures. This scripture is the speech of the Three Treasures; to slight its words is no different from slander. The Nine Heavens’ Perfected are supreme.\n\n“Supreme” means highest. “The secrecy is profound” refers to the repository of the scriptures. According to the *Seven Transformations’ Dance of Heaven Scripture*, the Supreme Clarity’s treasured scriptures number three hundred scrolls, the jade instructions nine thousand chapters, the talismanic diagrams seven thousand sections, along with the scriptures of spontaneity—all are concealed above the Nine Heavens in the Palace of Great Existence. The Palace of Great Existence is the Jade Clarity Palace.\n\nFurther, according to the *Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance Scripture*, the ninefold golden lattices and Purple Yang Jade Terrace—“ninefold” denotes the depth of the seals, while “lattice” refers to a kind of desk or stand. As the *Scripture of the Daoist Treasure* states, there are jade lattices and golden lattices, both belonging to the Nine Heavens. Above the Three Passes is the Jade Terrace, upon which rests the jade lattice where the Supreme August Perfected’s golden name is placed. This is not only revered but also a secret text. Unless the Dragon Han opens the charts and the Divine Kings risk transgression to earnestly entreat, how could one behold this scripture? Thus those who steal it incur punishment, while those who revere it attain immortality. Those who steal it should indeed take warning, and those who revere it should strive diligently.\n\nIn the Three Primes’ palaces, those whose golden names are recorded and whose purple characters are inscribed in the registers are destined in their next lives to become Perfected Immortals of the Three Clarities. When the karmic conditions align, they should present golden treasures to their masters, sincerely follow the precepts, and receive the scripture through covenant. They must guard their hearts and practice diligently, taking care never to leak it lightly, lest the wind-blades examine their bodies. The Three Primes’ judgment extends not only to the dead souls but to all—both those who have attained the Dao/Way and those who have not. Only those with golden names and purple characters are distinguished as students of immortality. Thus, in the records of the repositories, the Three Primes’ judging officials and the ranks of hell are called the “Ink Registers.” Those with golden names and purple characters are truly set apart from them.\n\nFormerly, Li Jue was a commoner of Jiangyang. His merit and conduct had long been recorded in the immortal registers. Though he had not yet ascended to heaven, his name was already inscribed in gold in the Huayang Grotto-Heaven. Not only students of immortality possess such distinctions. In secular records, when Emperor Yuan of Liang was Prince of Xiangdong, he once recorded loyal ministers, righteous scholars, and those with fine literary works, inscribing them with three grades of brushes: loyal and filial ones with golden tubes, those of virtuous conduct with silver tubes, and those with fine literature with mottled bamboo tubes.\n\nThe *Supreme Jade Instructions Scripture* states: In the Purple Tenuity Palace are golden lattices and jade books, red-gold writings, and azure jade tablets—all of this kind. If one has planted good roots in past lives and exhausted this karmic body, in the next life one will become a Perfected Immortal of the Three Clarities. Naturally, one will encounter this scripture, and one must then present golden treasures, follow the precepts, and receive it through covenant before one may cultivate. Otherwise, one will surely face the wind-blades’ examination.\n\nThese words bear repeating, for they are established for the intermediate and lesser vehicles. The wind-blades’ examination has been mentioned repeatedly in previous chapters: “the wind-blades for ten thousand kalpas, souls dying without rebirth,” and later, “the wind-blades’ mutual punishment”—how could one not be cautious?\n\nWhen the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings received the obeisance, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable said to them: “The treasured scripture is profoundly secret, the numinous sounds of the Nine Heavens, bestowed upon the supreme sages—not for the hearing of ghosts and spirits. The Perfected’s lattices are revealed once every forty thousand kalpas. Now, transgressing the prohibition, I entrust it to you—guard it well, and never transmit it lightly.” These words only caution against careless transmission. Is not the wind-blades’ examination established for those of the intermediate and lesser vehicles?\n\nThe *Celestial Precepts of the Supreme* state: “Those who transmit celestial scriptures and bring calamity upon their ancestors incur the grave sin of violating their proclamations, preventing the breach of their covenants.” Thus, the upper chapter of the *Black Register* records the Water and Fire Officials, and beyond them, the Wind-Blade Left and Right Officials. The Left Wind Examiner oversees those who receive scriptures, talismans, treasured instructions, or precepts without covenant, who cultivate for profit, sell the Dao/Way, or violate celestial statutes. The Right Blade Examiner governs those who break their vows, betray their masters and friends, abandon one for another, judge good and evil, or attack the root—none greater than these sins.",

To merely receive a single form, drifting along as if borrowing qi—though one has this body, if one does not understand the Dao/Way of generating the spirit, how is this different from a walking corpse?\n\nIf one attains this method, one may sit and govern the natural. This refers specifically to the *Scripture of Generating the Spirit* as a shortcut, bypassing liberation through the corpse and directly entering the Great Vehicle.\n\nWhere is this method found?

      "translated_text": "The transmission of the *Luminous Writ of the Great Empyrean*—where one imparts it upon encountering the worthy without fixed number—differs greatly from this. The method of cultivation requires a thousand-day fast, disengagement from worldly affairs, the cessation of all sensory leaks, a mind stilled to silence, the holding of incense and precepts, entry into the chamber facing east, nine knocks of the teeth, the modulation of voice to rectify qi, and the recitation of sacred scriptures. One summons the perfected to refine the body; when the body is purified, qi harmonizes. One embraces the Dao/Way to refine qi; when qi is purified, the spirit rejoices. Such is the method of the long fast.\n\nAs *Zhuangzi* states: “When the cosmos is at peace and settled, the radiance of heaven emerges.” The settled cosmos refers to the stilled mind. The essence of generating the spirit lies in nothing beyond this. All else is but worldly affairs. Before the minds of beings are aligned, the heart drifts like floating dust, clashing and grinding with things, racing like wind and blazing like fire, gradually stained by the dust of the world, never ceasing for a moment. After the fast, spirit and qi return to unity. For the spirit resides in the ears to hear, in the eyes to see, in the tongue to taste, in the heart to transform, and in the intent to shift swiftly—ever roaming among the six senses. Now, with the six senses unengaged and all sensory leaks stanched, the teachings speak of eight leaks: tears from the eyes, a leak of the liver; mucus from the nose, a leak of the lungs; saliva from the mouth, a leak of the kidneys; external sweat, a leak of the heart; night sweats, a leak of the small intestine; drooling in sleep, a leak of the brain; dreams of coupling with ghosts, a leak of the spirit; and lust, a leak of the body. All these leaks arise from the interplay of the five aggregates, six senses, and twelve sense-realms. If the body is filled with emptiness, hearing confined to the ears, and the mind fixed upon the talisman, then the sensory realms have no means of entry.\n\nOf old, Master Ge fasted for a thousand days on Mount Tiantai. Before a year had passed, he achieved resonance, and the lofty sages deigned to glance into his secluded chamber. Later generations’ methods of fasting trace their origin to this. Lord Yan the Perfected said: “Empty the heart to seek virtue/power; still the intent to await the numinous.” Since the hearts of beings have not yet merged with the Dao/Way, they are first taught the method of fasting, that through fasting they may quiet the heart, and through quieting the heart enter the Dao/Way. Yet later ages have inflamed it with worldly affairs, entangled it with form and instrument, and thus regard the fasting method—how grievously mistaken! The libationer-daoists have become mere corpse-invocators.\n\nFacing east upon entering the chamber draws upon the qi of life. Modulating the voice rectifies qi; profound resonance gathers the spirit—all essential elements of scripture recitation. Reciting once, the sound ascends to the nine heavens. Reciting twice, heaven and earth display reverence. Reciting thrice, the three realms bow to the chamber. Reciting four times, the Heavenly Kings descend as immortals. Reciting five times, the Five Emperors attend the perfected. Reciting six times, the Demon Kings bind themselves. Reciting seven times, the stellar constellations halt their gates. Reciting eight times, the darkest night is illuminated. Reciting nine times, all heavens descend, and every spirit and numen shields the chamber with their chariots.\n\nThe preceding chapter on cultivation methods speaks of nothing but returning to the body to perfect sincerity. Once one can return to the body, one becomes one with heaven, thereby attaining the utmost knowledge of heaven’s workings and humanity’s workings. The “utmost” refers to the harmonization of the boundary between heaven and humanity, rendering it seamless. Thus, reciting once, the sound ascends to the nine heavens—uttered here, heard there, signifying the scrutiny of above and below. Reciting twice, heaven and earth display reverence. The *Scripture of Salvation* speaks of heaven and earth offering rites, its meaning largely the same. Yet “reverence” and “rites” differ in weight; only when reverence gives rise to rites is perfection attained. Reciting thrice, the three realms bow to the chamber, showing that “rites” surpass “reverence.” Reciting four times, the Heavenly Kings descend as immortals. The scriptures contain titles such as Dharma King and Heavenly King, all exalted appellations of the lofty sages. “Descending as immortals” refers to the summoning of divine immortals to gather at the site, as when Master Ge studied the fasting method and beckoned the Primordial Immortal Xu Laile to descend into his quiet chamber.\n\nReciting five times, the Five Emperors attend the perfected, as when Lady Wei attained the Dao/Way and the Five Elderly Lords descended to her chamber, transmitting to her the Five Emperors’ staffs of authority. Reciting six times, the Demon Kings bind themselves. The *Guardian Numinous Incantation* speaks of the Demon Kings binding their heads and bodies—though the wording differs, the principle is the same. “Bind” means to restrain. Only after six recitations do the Demon Kings begin to restrain themselves, preventing reckless movement lest they provoke trials. Those who study the Dao/Way face many demonic trials: first the lesser trials of the Zi hour, then the great trials. Only after passing these two trials will the Demon Kings vouch for them, allowing ascent to the immortal ranks.\n\nYet the Demon Kings do not bind themselves at five or seven recitations, but only at six—why? The great demons of the six heavens are the residual qi of the six heavens, known as the supreme yin ghost-lords, their power equal to that of heaven. The Primordial Beginning commanded their creation along with the demons. Thus, the methods of fasting and offering in Daoist scriptures must first subdue them before success can be achieved. Six is the number of old yin, its might vast and great; hence, the fasting method must first command the demons at the Wu hour. This is the reason: the first yin arises at Wu, so one must first block its inception; if one acts too late, it cannot be remedied.\n\nOften seen at yellow altars with ten cases of incense, the initial night’s vigil begins in the north, the position of Zi. When refining the great elixir, one ignites the fire at the moment of first yang, proceeding through the six positions to the northeast, the Gen direction—precisely the ghostly realm, the abode of the six demons. This is Master Yuchan of Floating Mountain’s method of commanding demons. The unenlightened mistake it for merely commanding earthly demons, unaware that the great demons of the six caverns are none other than the great demons of the heavens above.",

      "translated_text": "During the time of the Han Celestial Master, distinctions were made between humans and ghosts, first by driving away the demons of the Six Heavens and consigning them to Northern Feng. Though called the Six Caverns of Fengdu, they are in truth celestial realms—one must not cling to their earthly locations. Within the Northern Capital of Luo Feng, the land of utmost yin, there also reside the immortal officials of the Six Caverns, who constantly examine and tally the records of those studying the immortal arts, governing the registers of the Three Realms. As the *Scripture of Salvation* states: \"The A-ren sings the Cavern Chapters to subdue Northern Luo Feng.\" Since the Cavern Chapters are sung, what connection do they have with Fengdu? Yet when it says \"subdue Northern Luo Feng,\" it refers to the demons of Luo Feng, who are in fact the chiefs of all demons. The following line, \"Expel and dispatch the demonic essences, sever the blades of the Six Ghosts,\" makes its meaning abundantly clear. Moreover, after the incantation for commanding demons, phrases such as \"the Three Heavens revolve in brightness\" and \"the Six Heavens come to their end\" appear—yet none understand their import. Since it is called \"commanding demons,\" what is being commanded? Many feign wisdom in vain.\n\nRecently, in the *Comprehensive Teachings Collection*, the transmitted practices can be discerned. However, Master Yuchan’s oral teachings were passed down from mouth to mouth and never committed to writing, lest they be leaked. I dare not speak of them recklessly.\n\n**Seven Passings: The Stellar Lodge Halts the Barrier**\nWhen the Most High Lord of the Dao expounded the *Scripture of Salvation*, the Celestial Pivot and Jade Balance halted their turning for a time. This scripture refers to it as \"halting the barrier,\" alluding to the handle of the Dipper. The seventh star of the Northern Dipper is called the Celestial Barrier Star, also known as Po Jun. The direction it points is where ghosts and spirits retreat, and practitioners of the Dao call this \"the unyielding qi.\"\n\n**Eight Passings: The Radiance of the Dark Night**\nIn the place of utmost yin, where neither sun nor moon shines, how can stagnant souls ascend and be delivered? This was the method Li Ruochong used to offer prayers for Zhang Lihua.\n\n**Nine Passings: The Descent of All Heavens**\nAll divine spirits, without exception, attend in reverence. Once the Nine Passings are complete, the merit thus accrued is such that the corpse abides while the dragon appears, the abyss is silent while thunder resounds—these are things that arise spontaneously, not by design. Long ago, Li Shunxing recited the *Great Cavern Scripture* for three years. One night, suddenly, thousands of flying immortals gathered in the sky, their divine radiance illuminating his chamber.

      "translated_text": "The true essence of the Dao is for the cultivation of the self; what remains may be applied to the state, and what is left over may be used to govern the world. One must first perfect the self before extending to others—this is the proper sequence of self-cultivation.\n\nYet this scripture requires a thousand-day fast, detachment from worldly affairs, and the complete cessation of all defilements. Only then, with a mind stilled and thoughts silent, can one commit to memory the number of recitations, wherein the merit of resonance with the cosmos arises. Here, in this chapter, the Nine Passings are again recorded, beginning with the self—does this not invert the proper order?\n\nThe methods of cultivation may proceed from within to without, or from without to within. Those who cultivate from within to without perfect the self, and their virtue becomes genuine. Those who proceed from without to inward may place the self last, yet the self comes first.\n\nCareful reflection on the scripture’s intent reveals no discrepancy with the preceding chapter. However, the merit of a single Passing reverberates through the Nine Heavens, and the primordial womb is fully opened—these principles admit of two explanations, hence they are recorded separately.\n\nAs the *Scripture of Salvation* states: reciting it once causes all the great sages of the heavens to praise it in unison; after ten recitations, withered bones revive and rise as living beings—this records the merit of ten recitations. Elsewhere it says: reciting it once summons the boundless hosts of the Perfected and Great Spirits of the Eastern Limitless Realm, who descend floating through the void—this records the principle of resonance. The sequence here mirrors that of this scripture; scholars must not cling to one approach alone.\n\n**One Passing: Penetrating the Heavens** opens the primordial womb and its origins—this refers to the beginning of human life. By the **Nine Passings**, the fundamental joints and origins simultaneously generate the gods, thereby expounding the teachings of self-cultivation. The meaning of the **Chapter on Generating the Gods** thus becomes clear.\n\nBefore birth, one dwells in darkness, devoid of light, without agency, suspended in obscurity. Though free from the fetters of affliction, even after countless eons, one remains but a wandering spirit, a suffering shade—what benefit is there? Zhuangzi lamented the metal in the crucible, grieving that after becoming human, one merely rots like grass and wood, deeming non-existence more peaceful. Those who fail to awaken seize upon this as justification, and those who speak of longevity dismiss it as an excrescence—truly, they are sinners within the teachings. Such is the fate of those who cultivate imperfectly and perish midway, using this as an excuse—how can this be worthy?\n\nThere are those who disdain life, regarding the four great elements as a temporary abode, enduring thirst without drinking, hunger without eating, lacking means to ward off cold or attain satiety. Their bodies wither, their mouths speak of suffering and emptiness, and they sit awaiting death. It is like dismantling a house to live exposed, or taking medicine to induce illness when no sickness exists—how can this accord with human nature? If this were deemed correct, heaven and earth would nearly cease to function.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy and Divine Kings, pitying such inverted views, thus composed the **Chapter on Generating the Gods**, awakening people to the truth that this body is born alongside heaven and earth. If one cultivates according to what is generated and refines what ought to be generated, this is the Dao of long life. Otherwise, Zhuangzi’s lament for the metal in the crucible remains apt. As Shao Kangjie’s poem says: *\"To die in vain a thousand times is just as if one had never been born.\"*\n\nWhen a person is conceived, essence and blood form the womb, gestating in the mother’s palace for three hundred days before the fetus is complete. At the moment essence and blood coalesce into the womb, a yellow, evolving qi emerges as the origin of life. If this qi flows unimpeded, ascending and descending without losing its measure, the principle of life gradually takes shape. If the womb’s source is obstructed, premature death or stillbirth may occur. Thus, the *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir* states: *\"If the Great One congeals, the nine qi stagnate and fail to transform; the Three Ones grieve and cannot gather, allowing the qi of death to enter, preventing completion.\"*\n\n**Two Passings: Resounding the Earth** unbinds the root of the fetal knot. Heaven is one, earth is two—these are the numbers of heaven and earth. Sound arises and echoes, yang initiates and yin responds. In the second month of human gestation, the fetus begins to take shape, marking the inception of form. Yet birth is the root of death; once the fetal form is established, the qi of death solidifies its root. Thus, those who perish in the womb or die before birth are not uncommon. Hence, the second chapter states: *\"Sever the root, seal the gate of death, nurture the infant with brightness and harmony.\"* Once the fetal root is unbound and the principle of life gradually matures, it is like the Supreme One Emperor Lord’s method of resolving the three barriers and twelve knots with cinnabar talismans inscribed on green bamboo membranes—this is recorded in the *Upper Clarity Cavern Mystery Scripture*.\n\n**Three Passings: Spirit Transforms** refines the Gate of the Hun into immortality. Heaven-one generates water, which in humans becomes essence; heaven-three generates wood, which in humans becomes the hun-soul. At the third Passing, the hun-soul first takes form. The *Scripture of Jade Mushroom Immortals* states: *\"In the third month of gestation, yin and yang divide.\"* Once yin and yang separate, the hun-soul arises on the left and the po-soul on the right—this is an inevitable principle. Those who cultivate must first restrain the hun and control the po. The hun pertains to mercury, the po to lead. Mercury’s nature is volatile; at death, the hun departs first. The *Scripture of Salvation* says: *\"The lofty, pure, and numinous spirits sing mournfully in the vast sky\"*—lamenting the death of humans.\n\nAt conception, once the hun-soul is complete, the physical form is established, entering the Gate of Primordial Simplicity, where yin and yang separate and intermingle. The left is the Gate of the Hun, the right the Door of the Po. Once the hun is refined, the dead may be revived, and the living may attain immortality—hence the term *\"extending the heavens\"* refers to the qi of enlightened immortality. The character *\"refine\"* (炼) here denotes the process of silk purification, as used frequently in the scriptures, rather than the character for *\"smelting\"* (炼). It signifies the primordial simplicity—the fundamental origin of human life, for *\"when the root is established, the Dao is born.\"*",

Long ago, Li Shunxing recited the *Great Cavern Scripture* for three years. One night, suddenly, thousands of flying immortals gathered in the sky, their divine radiance illuminating his chamber. What is cultivated here manifests there—how could this be mere deception?\n\n**One Passing: Penetrating the Heavens**\nThe primordial womb and its origins are fully opened and made clear.",

      "translated_text": "At the time of Primordial Simplicity, when hardness and softness first separate, one takes its pure essence—like silk purified to whiteness—thus easily attaining immortality. Hence the later passage speaks of *\"the floating, floating refined silk blossom,\"* its meaning identical to this. When the Four Celestial Kings descend to bestow immortality, the Door of the Po closes its gate.\n\nThe fourth phase generates metal, which in humans becomes the lungs—the repository of the po-soul. The third phase speaks of the Gate of the Hun, while the fourth speaks of the Door of the Po, for these are the gates and doors of the entire body. Moreover, at the beginning of human life, the kidneys form first, followed by the spleen. The spleen then generates the liver, and the liver in turn generates the lungs. Between liver and lungs lie the gates of transmission and conduction.\n\nThe kidneys belong to water, yet within water resides fire; when ascended, it becomes qi. Riding this qi upward, it pays homage to the heart. The heart generates fluid, which bears yin downward to return to the kidneys. Without the liver and lungs to transmit and conduct, how could the union be achieved to form the Dragon and Tiger? Thus, the greatest obstacle for ancient immortals and perfected ones in refining the elixir lay in the separation between metal and wood.\n\nNow, if the liver can transmit the kidney’s qi to pay homage to the heart, and the lungs can conduct the heart’s fluid to reach the kidneys—timing without error—then the Yellow Sprout will arise. This is called the Golden Elixir. How magnificent!\n\nYet if it speaks of transmission and conduction, why also say the Door of the Po closes its gate? This refers to the gate at the beginning of life, before cultivation has begun. Fearing that the qi of death might harm the qi of life, it is thus commanded to close its gate.\n\nIn the fifth phase, the Five Emperors pay homage to the perfected, and the viscera become clear and frozen. By the fifth month of human life, the five viscera are fully formed, and the spleen’s count is complete. What appears within is called the *zang*, while what appears without is called flesh. Then the Five Emperors naturally pay homage: the Green Emperor guards the hun, the White Emperor attends the po, the Red Emperor nurtures qi, the Black Emperor circulates blood, and the Yellow Emperor presides at the center—none of the myriad spirits transgress this order.\n\nThe six bowels arise as earth generates fire, which then generates the small intestine; the small intestine generates the large intestine; the large intestine generates the gallbladder; the gallbladder generates the stomach; the stomach generates the bladder; together with the Triple Burner, these form the six bowels.\n\nAlas! Without the other, there is no self; without the self, there is nothing to take. Thus, the self depends on the other, and the other depends on the self. The wonder of spirit-generation lies not merely in its absence of traces—it may truly be called natural.",

      "translated_text": "The Six Perils’ Demon Kings submit in acquiescence, and the stomach duct generates fluid. The five viscera all possess fluid, but only the left kidney governs it. Now, the stomach belongs to earth, and water is halted by earth—thus the stomach duct becomes the receptacle for fluid. The *Immortal Canon of Visualization Techniques* states: \"Visualize at the stomach’s opening a wondrous girl-infant, naked and unclothed, standing upright within the stomach duct. She opens her mouth to receive and channel the numinous liquid, inhaling the five qi upward, drawing them into her mouth to swallow, then sending them into the mouth of the Mysterious Maiden.\" All that a person eats and drinks gathers in the stomach, silently refined by the scorching fire. The pure becomes fluid, ever moistening like cloud and rain, ascending to the Nine Heavens; the turbid descends as dregs, like excrement and earth, excreted into the Nine Earths. When gathered in the mouth, it becomes water; when refined by the lungs, it becomes spittle; when refined by the heart, it becomes blood; when refined by the kidneys, it becomes essence—none of these are other than fluid. As the *Pointers to the Mysterious* states: the heart and kidneys form the cinnabar origin, while the liver and kidneys serve as the fire’s regulator. At noon, sit in quiet seclusion, close the eyes and still the mind, hold the fluid in the mouth, and draw the breath subtly through the nose to its utmost. Retain the fluid to press it down, and the true dragon will not ascend; draw the breath to withdraw it, and the true tiger will not descend. Passing through the Yellow Court, this becomes the constant of the Mysterious Pearl, which when employed washes and purifies the chest and intestines. Thus the scripture says: \"The numinous fluid is locked in place, its source ever-flowing and moistening.\" The Perfected One often told people: \"The human body requires moisture.\" Yet most do not understand this—what a pity!\n\nThe Seven Perils’ stellar lodges shine brightly, and the orifices open to keen perception. Heaven has the seven luminaries, and humans have the seven apertures. Those that traverse the five circuits by night are the seven luminaries; those that course through the five viscera are the seven apertures. In the seventh month of gestation, the essence of the seven stars opens the seven apertures, enabling sight, hearing, eating, and breathing. While the seven apertures are uniform in all people, their acuity varies. Yet acuity originates in the heart, for the heart belongs to spirit and fire, and fire illuminates things. Seven is the number of lesser yang and belongs to metal; only when metal becomes an instrument can it carve and open. Thus, the most intelligent possess seven apertures in the heart, the average have five, the lesser have three, the perceptive have two, the ordinary have one, and the foolish have none. Zhuangzi said: \"Is it only the body that may be deaf and blind? Even wisdom may be so.\" Those who are dull and ignorant, whose acuity remains unopened, are not bound by their apertures—it is rather a matter of innate endowment.\n\nThe Eight Perils’ dark night reveals its light, and the Three Regions and Eight Sceneries fully integrate form and spirit. Human life begins with the primal qi as its ancestor. From one comes three, and from three united with five arise the Eight Sceneries. Three eights make the twenty-four spirits—this is the transformation of yin and yang. If one knows this transformation, then the cosmos lies within the palm, and creation arises within the body. The Daoist *Record of the Covenant of Might* takes the Three Origins and Five Virtues Generals as its essence and function, transforming them into twenty-four stages corresponding to the twenty-four qi—this is precisely what is meant. As for transformation, none surpasses that of yin and yang. Now, three and five are the numbers of the sun and moon, with *wu* and *ji* paired with *kan* and *li*. Humans receive the qi of yin and yang, the Three Origins and Five Movements, uniting them within the body. Transforming and harmonizing them, they naturally align with the twenty-four qi within the Supreme Ultimate. Thus the *Yellow Court Canon* says: \"The Way of nurturing life is not burdensome—simply cultivate the *Cavernous Mystery* and *Jade Chapters*, along with the Eight Scenery Spirits within the body, and the twenty-four Perfected will emerge naturally.\" Therefore, the *Plain Questions and Spiritual Pivot* states: \"The twenty-four qi intermingle in yellow chaos, congealing into qi and transforming. Within the qi dwell twenty-four spirits, congealing into numen and generating life—not from the womb, but all from the qi of the Three-One Imperial Stars.\" Now, if the Three Regions and Eight Sceneries fully integrate form and spirit, yet are said not to originate from the womb, how then may one attain them in the human body? Those who attain them must begin with self-cultivation. As the immortal Xu the Grand Master’s instructions say: \"At dawn, visualize the Upper Scenery; at noon, the Middle Scenery; at midnight, the Lower Scenery.\" The *Treasured Jade Record* states: \"One who does not visualize the twenty-four qi or know the names of the Three Regions and Eight Sceneries cannot be a citizen of Great Peace, nor a minister of the Later Sage.\" Thus, the Perfected Lords of West City and the Paulownia-Cypress Immortal both practiced this method to attain the Dao. The names and numbers of the twenty-four spirits are respectfully recorded below.\n\n**Upper Eight Sceneries:**\nSpirit of the Fontanel, Spirit of the Hair, Spirit of the Skin, Spirit of the Eyes, Spirit of the Neck, Spirit of the Ears, Spirit of the Nose, Spirit of the Tongue.\n\n**Middle Eight Sceneries:**\nSpirit of the Throat, Spirit of the Lungs, Spirit of the Heart, Spirit of the Liver, Spirit of the Gallbladder, Spirit of the Left Kidney, Spirit of the Right Kidney, Spirit of the Spleen.\n\n**Lower Eight Sceneries:**\nSpirit of the Stomach, Spirit of the Large Intestine, Spirit of the Small Intestine, Spirit of the Navel, Spirit of the Diaphragm, Spirit of the Knees, Spirit of the Left Yin and Left Yang, Spirit of the Right Yin and Right Yang.\n\nThe remaining forms, incantations, and instructions cannot be fully recorded here. I once saw the commentary by Wang Shen of Poyang on the Three Regions and Eight Sceneries, which called them the Eight Trigrams—how laughable! Thus, I have written this out to enlighten later students and prevent such errors.\n\nThe Nine Perils’ myriad heavens descend in observation, and the Three Passes, Five Viscera, Six Bowels, Nine Palaces, Golden Towers and Jade Chambers, Twelve Heavy Gates, Purple Portals and Jade Caskets, and thirty-six thousand joints—all their roots and origins simultaneously generate spirit. Before a person receives life, in the boundless void, this is called the Supreme Simplicity. When it transforms into qi, this is called the Supreme Origin. When qi transforms into form, this is called the Supreme Beginning. Yin receives yang and generates life, qi follows the transformation of the embryo—this is called the Supreme Simplicity. When the numinous light enters the body and separates from the mother, after ten months of gestation, this is called the Supreme Ultimate. At the moment of birth, the myriad spirits are all complete—from whence do they come? Life is the great virtue of Heaven and Earth. The Way of Heaven values life, and it is through life that they are attained.",

      "translated_text": "The Three Passes: The *Yellow Court Scripture* designates the mouth as the Heavenly Pass, the hands as the Human Pass, and the feet as the Earthly Pass. The immortal scriptures take the Mud-Pill Palace as the Upper Pass, the Crimson Palace as the Middle Pass, and the Lower Cinnabar Field as the Lower Pass. Only the Perfected One of True Yang considers the twenty-four vertebrae of the spine, each pass comprising three joints. Below the brain is called the Jade Pass; the spine itself is called the Middle Pass; and the region opposite the inner kidneys is called the Lower Pass. Alternately, the eyes are taken as the Upper Pass, the nose as the Middle Pass, and the mouth as the Lower Pass.\n\nThe five viscera are explained in the annotations above. Once the five viscera and six bowels generate spirit, the large intestine becomes the Jade Hall Bowel, the small intestine the Primordial Yang Bowel, the left bladder the Supreme Harmony Bowel, the right bladder the Supreme Simplicity Bowel, the stomach the Central Yellow Bowel, and the gallbladder the Supreme Clarity Bowel—these are the six bowels.\n\nThe Nine Palaces: the kidneys are the Cinnabar Prime Palace; the small intestine, the Vermilion Mound Palace; the liver, the Shang Terrace Palace; the gallbladder, the Heavenly Numinous Palace; the spleen, the Yellow Court Palace; the large intestine, the Mysterious Numinous Palace; the lungs, the Ministerial Palace; the bladder, the Jade Chamber Palace; and the heart, the Crimson Empyrean Palace. The *Cavernous Perfection Scripture* states: three-tenths of an inch between the eyebrows is the Twin Cinnabar Palace; one inch inward is the Hall of Light Palace; three inches inward is the Cinnabar Field Palace, also called the Mud-Pill Palace; four inches inward is the Flowing Pearl Palace; five inches inward is the Imperial Palace. One inch above the Hall of Light is the Heavenly Court Palace; one inch above the Cavernous Chamber is the Ultimate Perfection Palace; one inch above the Cinnabar Field is the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace; one inch above the Flowing Pearl is the Supreme August Palace.\n\nThe Golden Tower is the throat, also called the Double Tower. Within it are twelve constables, each wielding a jade halberd to guard it, while the Perfected One resides inside, governing the circulation of qi between above and below. In recent times, Su Dongpo wrote: *\"Frost seals the jade tower, cold raises gooseflesh\"*—referring precisely to this. The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: *\"Within the double tower, twelve rings ascend and descend, all inhabited by Perfected Ones.\"*\n\nThe Jade Chamber is another name for the brain palace. The *Yellow Court Scripture* calls it the Jasper Chamber. The Twelve-Layered Gates refer to the twelve rings of the throat. The Purple Portal, as the *Essential Spirit Middle Scroll* states, lies within the space above the two eyebrows. The *Cavernous Chamber Inner Scripture* says: *\"The two passes of the Purple Portal extend to the Mysterious Essence.\"* The spirit of the Purple Portal is named Tranquil Serenity, styled Dharma King.\n\nThe Jade Casket, as the *Yellow Court* calls it, is the Jade Hall. The thirty-six thousand joints—roots, origins, and beginnings—generate spirit all at once. All the above are the spirits of the body: eighteen thousand yang spirits form the outer landscape, and eighteen thousand yin spirits form the inner spirits, together making thirty-six thousand—a truly unparalleled treasure. If one knows the spirit as spirit, one may wander with creation in the formless; if one does not know the spirit as spirit, one remains endlessly toiling, never witnessing accomplishment—is this not a great sorrow?\n\nNine cycles make one round. When one round is complete, the Three Realms record one’s name, the Five Emperors acknowledge one’s distinction, and one is called a Perfected One. Ten rounds unify qi, enabling mastery over the myriad spirits; demon kings offer protection, and one is listed among the heavens. A hundred rounds unify spirit, allowing one to sit and attain spontaneity; the Supreme Unity grants its talisman, and the Primordial Lord bestows life. A thousand rounds unify numinosity, enabling one to sit in existence or vanish at will; jade lads and maidens serve at one’s command. Ten thousand rounds complete the Way, allowing one to ride the dragon chariot and ascend in broad daylight.\n\nIn speaking of the Way, nothing precedes yin and yang; in speaking of yin and yang, one must seek their interpenetration. My body stands between the two poles; its life is coeval with Heaven and Earth, and its number accords with yin and yang. Front and back follow in succession, high and low continue without end; advantage and harm are not constant, beginnings and endings are not uniform. They mutually aid, mutually generate, mutually restrain, and mutually govern—all is but a single qi. If one knows how to interpenetrate, then creation has principles that may be altered, and one may achieve existence or vanishing at will through cycles.\n\nThe scripture takes nine cycles as one round: ten rounds unify qi, a hundred rounds unify spirit, a thousand rounds unify numinosity, and ten thousand cycles complete the Way—only then may one ascend in daylight. The number of scripture recitations is based on nine, for nine is the utmost of yang, and when things reach their extreme, they transform. The body has nine palaces, externally nine orifices; Heaven has nine heavens, and below are nine tiers. The elixir has nine revolutions, and the method has nine accomplishments. Seven and eight are the reckonings of yin and yang; six and nine are their investigations. Reckoning does not change, but investigation does. Through nine cycles, the Three Passes, Five Viscera, Six Bowels, and Nine Palaces—everywhere—generate spirit, fulfilling the thirty-six thousand. This is not an arbitrary extension to reach that number, but rather the natural result of qi interpenetrating and transforming of itself.\n\nFor example, reciting the scripture once already manifests the free flow of the primordial womb. The word \"flow\" is evident here: if one cannot achieve flow, how does this body differ from a clod of earth? How could one sit in existence or vanish at will? Thus, ten rounds unify qi, and qi congeals into spirit; a hundred rounds unify spirit, and spirit generates numinosity; a thousand rounds unify numinosity, and numinosity achieves perfect transformation and boundless efficacy, fully animating the spirit—only then may one meet the Way. Therefore, ten thousand rounds complete the Way, enabling ascent in broad daylight, the Three Realms recording one’s name, and one’s name inscribed in the heavens—this is truly so.\n\nThe Five Emperors acknowledge one’s distinction, and one is called a Perfected One. If one is a friend of the Five Emperors, one’s rank is equal to theirs—why then is one still called a Perfected One? Because those of the same gate are friends, yet \"friendly distinction\" further differentiates one’s destined realm. For instance, the *Yellow Emperor’s Forty-Four Methods Scripture* states: those who recite the *Great Elixir Hidden Writ*, the *Golden Flower Cavern Chamber*, and the *Feminine Unity Precious Chapter* are thereby called Masters of the Three Caverns and Perfected Ones of the Primordial Radiance.",
      "overlap_context": " called the Supreme Beginning. Yin receives yang and generates life, qi follows the transformation of the embryo—this is called the Supreme Simplicity. When the numinous light enters the body and separates from the mother, after ten months of gestation, this is called the Supreme Ultimate. At the moment of birth, the myriad spirits are all complete—from whence do they come? Life is the great virtue of Heaven and Earth. The Way of Heaven values life, and it is through life that they are attained.",

      "translated_text": "The rank of Perfected One corresponds to the High Immortal of the Unified Imperial Cavern and the Mystic Master of the Dao; the rank of Upper Radiance Perfected One corresponds to the Great Master of the Nine Palaces and Upper Immortal. Now, according to the *Forty-Four Methods Scripture*, one may thereby become a Master of the Three Heavens and a Supreme Perfected One, with a rank equivalent to that of a Celestial Minister of the Great Ultimate.\n\nDemon Kings vouch for one’s attainment, first testing and then recommending upon success. To \"sit and attain spontaneously\" is to summon the mobile kitchens of the Six Jia spirits. The *Taiyi Single Talisman* is received by the Primordial Lady at birth. Yet Taiyi comprises five spirits, bearing the five registers of talismans—all part of the Dao of the Supreme Clarity Emperor Lord’s primordial fusion, the esoteric method for seeking immortality and transcendence as a divine immortal.\n\nAccording to the Five Talismans, write in blue ink on white paper, inscribe them on one’s life-destined day, store them in a brocade pouch, and wear them to attain longevity and deathlessness. The Primordial Lady is the title for women who attain the Dao, and thus the Great Dao possesses the deity of Feminine Unity, referring to this.\n\nI, Jin, note from the *Scripture of Great Possession*: the human head contains the Nine Palaces. The Jade Emperor’s Palace is inhabited by the Divine Mother of Jade Clarity; the Heavenly Court Palace by the Perfected Woman of Supreme Clarity; the Ultimate Perfection Palace by the Imperial Consort of the Great Ultimate; and the Supreme August Palace by the Supreme Sovereign Queen. These four palaces are the primordial yin palaces of the celestial origin, where primal qi had not yet arisen, the Five Norms had not yet been heard, and the myriad things were blended in undifferentiated transformation. Heaven and earth endure through these four Perfected Ones. Without knowing the inner names of the Feminine Perfected, one cannot attain immortality in ten thousand cases.\n\nThese four palaces exist within all people; without cultivation, the Perfected Palaces remain empty. When one recites [the scripture] a hundred times, their spirits naturally arise. Thus, the *Yellow Court Scripture* states: \"Within the jade chamber, the Eight Purities gather; the Lady of the Mud-Pill Palace stands at the center.\" To \"sit in disappearance and stand in vanishing\" is to command jade lads and maidens to dispatch affairs east and west—this is the method of guarding the Three Ones.\n\nUpon reaching a thousand recitations, what path remains obstructed? This is what is meant by \"divergent paths converging in a single essential culmination.\" I, Jin, note from the *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Mystic Cinnabar of the Hall of Light*: If a Daoist practices the Supreme Lord’s method of summoning the Three Ones to guard the form, ingests talismans for five years, and thereby meets Perfected Ones, after nine years they will attain spiritual penetration and clairvoyant vision, able to \"sit in disappearance and stand in vanishing,\" command the Six Ding spirits, and be granted by heaven twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens. They will ride clouds and drive dragons, roam and feast in the Jade Palace, and ascend at dawn—thus completing their tasks.\n\n\"Dawn\" refers to the time of the cock’s crow. I, Jin, note from the incantation of the *Mystic Scripture of the Supreme Mystery Emperor*: \"Ascend bodily at dawn and ascend in broad daylight.\" The zenith of heaven is broad daylight; the cock’s first crow is the ascent at dawn. Thus, when visualizing the primordial fusion of Taiyi, this time is often used—it is the hour of generative qi. The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: \"Donning feathered robes, the Eight Winds are driven; steering the Three Purities, one rides the morning clouds.\" How joyous is this!\n\n*Explication of the Wondrous Scripture of the Natural Generation of Spirits in the Nine Heavens of the Mystic and Numinous Treasure, Fascicle the Upper, Concluded*\n\n*Explication of the Wondrous Scripture of the Natural Generation of Spirits in the Nine Heavens of the Mystic and Numinous Treasure, Fascicle the Middle*\n\nInterpreted by Wang Xichao, a Daoist of the Chongxu Abbey in Mianzhou\n\nAt a time of stillness, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning resided in leisure within the Yellow Chamber of the Cloud Palace, amidst seven-jeweled curtains. Cultivating simplicity, refining the true in emptiness and azure, savoring the profound wisdom of the Mystic Treasure, he delved into the subtle principles of generating spirits, the profound mystery of the Great Fusion, and intoned the clarity of the Nine Heavens.\n\nThis scripture lacks a preface. From the inception of the Three Treasures and the arising of qi, heaven and earth were established, and the myriad people and things received life and form. Among these, the reception of human life is the most noble. Thus, the *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating Spirits* is the numinous text formed by the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery. When recited as a Heavenly Treasure, it illuminates the light of heaven and earth. It is known that once heaven and earth were established, they awaited this to become luminous—not through elaborate discourse, hence the absence of a preface.\n\nWithout a preface, the purport of the entire scripture would lack an entry point; thus, this serves as the preface. For scholars who ascend the Dao or attain liberation through the corpse, without this text, it is as if they wander as mere qi. Upon reaching the nine recitations of the scripture, once this text is obtained, one must maintain long-term purity, uphold the precepts, exhaust all worldly defilements, pacify the mind in silent recitation, and then practice this method. Having attained this method, one must complete nine recitations to have one’s name recorded in the Three Realms, be acknowledged as a friend by the Five Emperors, and be called a Perfected One. Yet even as a Perfected One, one is not yet fully accomplished. Only after ten thousand recitations, when the Dao is complete, does one ascend at dawn in broad daylight—thus manifesting the essence and function. This is the main doctrinal section.\n\nHerein, the scripture’s purport reaches its culmination, where the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning bestows it upon the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit King. After the transmission, the ritual concluded, the myriad heavens resumed their positions. The Heavenly Worthy again addressed the Flying Celestial Spirit King, stating that this *Scripture of the Nine Heavens* is the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, and so forth. This constitutes the circulation section.\n\nThough the intervening words are many, within the main doctrinal section, repeated contemplation exhausts their functions, as seen in the main doctrinal section.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the repeated admonitions and warnings serve only to emphasize that the *Primordial Beginning’s Forbidden Writ* must not be lightly transmitted. Thereupon, the Flying Celestial Spirit King entreated again and again, and the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning likewise admonished repeatedly—hence the profusion of words. As for the nine chapters, though they embody the purport of this single scripture and are appended thereafter, they resemble the *Great Brahmā’s Hidden Text* of the *Scripture of Salvation*, composed by the Dao Lord and attached after the preface to the *Scripture of Salvation*, without bearing any distinct meaning. Scholars must discern this for themselves.\n\nThe heart of the sage in saving beings is not unwilling to exhaust hair and skin or soak hands and feet in haste to deliver others. Yet without seeking or welcoming, responding without concealing, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning abides in stillness and seclusion, awaiting the knock before revealing. Unchanging in oneness, this is the utmost stillness. Composing seven-character verses while dwelling in the Elixir Pearl—this is the utmost leisure. The Yellow Chamber of the Numinous Palace is the place of repose, as the *Scripture of Numinous Writ* states: \"The Azure Emperor of the Eastern Sea observed a three-year purification retreat in the Vermilion Tower’s Yellow Chamber.\" The *Scripture of the Inner Sounds of the Myriad Heavens* says: \"The Yellow Chamber’s chamber governs the merits of the Flying Celestial Perfected of the sun and moon.\"\n\nWithin the seven-jeweled canopy, there are two meanings. The Dharma-body’s seven treasures arise from the five phases of heaven and earth that generate this body—none may be lacking. For the practitioner, they are: essence, tears, saliva, fluid, blood, sweat, and tears—these are the seven treasures. Serene and nurturing simplicity, profound is their abode. Empty azure refining the real, congealed is their purity. Immersed in the sweetness of the Cavern’s wisdom, the fullness of the Dao’s flavor. Bending to study the *Engendering the Spirit*, embracing the spirit in stillness. Principles subtle and vast, whistling resounds through the nine heavens.\n\nThe later chapter records the *Principles Subtle and Vast Writ*, its whistled recitations jade-like, its purport identical though its characters slightly differ. Since the Heavenly Worthy has already attained serene nurturing simplicity, empty azure refining the real, immersion in the Cavern’s sweetness, and study of *Engendering the Spirit*, it is known that this Dao’s mystery lies in principles so subtle they lack form. Without form, there is no trace to lodge, and so one whistles aloft in the nine heavens, finding brief contentment therein. As for this Dao, who could fathom it? Whistling issues from the throat in a piercing sound—later generations’ long whistling derives from this.\n\nAt that time, the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit King, the Jade Assistant Prime Minister, and the Four Harmonious Attendants of Dawn, having purified themselves and raised their standards, stood in attendance at his side. Leaning upon his jade countenance, they sensed the marvelous; gazing up at his numinous eyes, their hearts opened in reverence. Secretly glimpsing the spirit chapters, they leapt with joy; feasting upon the celestial sounds, they were reborn. Daring to seize the moment for enlightenment, they exposed their hearts beneath his divine glance.\n\nAt that time—that very moment—the place where the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning presided naturally drew the attendance of ten thousand numina and a thousand perfected. In this scripture, the divine feet are still indicated, along with the Jade Assistant Prime Minister and the Four Harmonious Attendants of Dawn—these are the close ministers. The Spirit King is recorded in the *Scripture of the River Chart* as one of the Flying Celestial Spirit Kings of the ten directions of heaven, lord of all spirits, flying through the three realms, commanding the host of spirits—of which there are nearly three kinds. Some are born from congealed qi, not through womb-delivery. Others are karmic rebirths, having accrued good merit among ghosts and spirits in former lives and now receiving their reward in the position of Spirit King. Still others are karmic manifestations, born through the conditions of accumulated kalpas.\n\nIn the Golden Tower are the Four Heavenly Emperors, called assisting ministers—they are like fathers. Revered as fathers, they decree, proclaim, and propagate—thus they are called prime ministers. The Four Harmonious are like the former and latter ministers of state, the left and right assistants. \"Harmonious\" means accord. The Attendants of Dawn resemble those of the Xuanzheng era, when the flourishing of Daoist learning led to the establishment of Attendants of Dawn—officials who stand at the emperor’s side, awaiting questions with empty minds, hence the purification retreat. The standard they raise is used to summon the ghosts and spirits of the three realms—this is what the Spirit King holds.\n\nBeholding the jade countenance, one senses the marvelous in the heart; gazing up at the numinous eyes, the breast opens in clarity. When the sage abides in leisure, he preserves the spirit through emptiness and accommodates beings with a pure heart. Beings without the Dao’s rectitude are guided to enlightenment, fulfilling their intentions. The \"jade countenance\" speaks of its jade-like purity; the \"numinous eyes\" speak of their penetrating illumination. Thereupon, the Flying Celestial Spirit King, observing the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning bending to study *Engendering the Spirit* and whistling through the nine heavens, felt his heart leap with joy and wished to pose a question. He first declared: \"If I seize this opportunity, I may lay bare my long-held heart.\" Though he spoke of \"daring to offend the numinous eyes,\" without this moment, the *Engendering the Spirit* chapters could not be transmitted. Just as the Flying Celestial Spirit King purified himself and advanced, how could the Heavenly Worthy refuse?\n\nThereupon, the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit King, stepped forward, bowed, and prostrated himself, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: \"This humble servant, by fortunate convergence, has been permitted to attend your numinous chariot. Not deeming my shortcomings too narrow, you have cleansed me in the dark ford, granted me repeated enlightenment of the congealed mystery, and elevated me to the rank of Spirit King, commanding life and death, encompassing the celestial immortals, overseeing the seven awakenings, gazing into distant lands, harmoniously observing the prime minister, and facing the Attendants of Dawn.\"\n\nThis passage records the Flying Celestial Spirit King’s desire to request the transmission of the *Engendering the Spirit* chapters. First, he offered these words to the Heavenly Worthy: \"This humble servant, by fortunate convergence, has been permitted to attend your numinous chariot. Not deeming my shortcomings too narrow, you have cleansed me in the dark ford.\" These are the Spirit King’s humble words. As for \"granted me repeated enlightenment of the congealed mystery, elevated me to the rank of Spirit King, commanding life and death, encompassing the celestial immortals\"—this is the moment for benevolence without refusal. Mencius said: \"In the present age, if not me, then who?\" Carefully savoring the scripture’s words, they resemble the *Dragon Scenery Mysterious Writ Scripture*, which records: \"The Supreme Ultimate Perfected stood before the Dao Lord, prostrating himself to request the marvelous writ. The Most High leaned forward and intoned: 'Subtle and profound indeed! Truly beyond measure. You have ascended to the Supreme Ultimate, encompassing the ancestral lineage of the spirits. Now I entrust this to you—diligently uphold it.'\"",
      "overlap_context": " Boundless Spirit King. After the transmission, the ritual concluded, the myriad heavens resumed their positions. The Heavenly Worthy again addressed the Flying Celestial Spirit King, stating that this *Scripture of the Nine Heavens* is the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, and so forth. This constitutes the circulation section.\n\nThough the intervening words are many, within the main doctrinal section, repeated contemplation exhausts their functions, as seen in the main doctrinal section.",

      "translated_text": "The discourse now reaches its grand harmony.\n\nAs for the bestowal of oversight over the Seven Awakening Factors and the far-reaching gaze across distant realms, the harmonious observation of the Supreme Ministers, and the audience with the Dawn Attendants—only then does one witness the Spirit King’s ascent to the loftiest rank, where the *Chapter of Engendering the Spirits* must be entrusted to him. Moreover, at the juncture where life and death intersect and the division between good and evil is determined, ensuring not even the slightest error demands a person of towering wisdom and discernment—who else could suffice?\n\n\"Bestowal of oversight\" refers to the imperial mandate of favor and pacification. The \"Seven Awakening Factors\" denote wisdom, for their number is seven, hence the term. This is recorded in the *Scripture on Dispelling Demons*. \"Far-reaching gaze across distant realms\" signifies wisdom illuminating all things without exception. \"Harmonious observation of the Supreme Ministers, audience with the Dawn Attendants\" refers to the preceding passage in the scripture, when the Spirit King stood alongside the Jade Assistants, the Supreme Ministers, and the Four Harmonious Dawn Attendants. It was not merely that the Spirit King seized the moment for enlightenment and communion, desiring to transmit the *Chapter of Engendering the Spirits* to the world below. Rather, in harmoniously observing the Supreme Ministers and the Dawn Attendants, all shared this aspiration. Yet the Spirit King, undeterred by the risk of overstepping, stepped forward and bowed—truly, the benevolent must possess courage.\n\nAt that very moment, seizing the opportunity and responding to the confluence, he trod the Ninefold Great Yang, penetrating the principles of the Yin Talisman, and took the multitudes into his charge. The great cycle neared its end, the reckoning of *jiashen* drew to a close, and the deluge scoured away filth as calamities spread across the heavens. The Three Palaces wielded their brushes, distinguishing the lineages of humanity, assessing merits and transgressions, and separating good from evil.\n\nThe sword of Gan and Yue, though sheathed and hidden, is not without use—yet if drawn at the wrong time, it becomes an ill omen. The piglet’s discarded offspring, though base and unlike medicine, when used appropriately, can serve as the emperor’s teacher. Thus, scholars of resolve do not lack the desire to establish merit, to rescue life and death, but rather, the timing may or may not be opportune.\n\nConsider the Flying Celestial Spirit King, who governs life and death and takes the care of the multitudes as his duty. At the very moment when the great cycle nears its end, the teachings decline, and heaven and humanity suffer in chaos—how could the Spirit King forget his compassionate heart? For the \"opportunity\" is the subtle movement that foreshadows fortune or misfortune. He who perceives the opportunity and acts does not wait until the day’s end—how much more so for a divine being?\n\nThus, the Flying Celestial Spirit King, whose office oversees the Three Realms, rightly treads the Ninefold Great Yang and penetrates the principles of the Yin Talisman—this is his inherent duty. \"Treading\" means encountering. Nine is the number of Yang. It is also said that the Six Qi of Great Yang, from *mao* to *wu*, constitute the Great Yang, signifying its fullness. When Yang reaches its extreme, Yin arises, giving birth to the great flood. \"Penetrating\" means to comprehend. To comprehend the principles of the Yin Registers is thus called the Yin Talisman.\n\n\"The great cycle nears its end, the reckoning of *jiashen* draws to a close\"—this refers to the kalpic cycle. The concept of the kalpic cycle appears frequently in the teachings, with varying interpretations upon examination. The *Crimson Writ Scripture* defines thirty days as one exchange, twelve exchanges as one degree, 3,300 degrees as a minor kalpa, and 9,900 degrees as a major kalpa. According to the calculations of the *Great Evolution*, nineteen years form one chapter, four chapters form one section, twenty sections form one epoch, and three epochs form one era. When 4,620 years complete three eras, it marks the end of one kalpa. However, according to the imperial commentary on the *Scripture of Salvation Through the Celestial Realms*, the Jade Clarity’s kalpic exchange spans 3,000 billion 909,510,000 years, the Highest Clarity’s transformation of essence spans 70 billion 390,000 years, and the Great Clarity’s refinement spans 50 billion 120,000 years. These accounts in the *Crimson Writ* and the *Great Evolution* imperial commentary differ.\n\nFurthermore, according to the *Scripture of the True Dharma*, the heavens have twelve celestial nets, and the earth has twelve terrestrial markers. The heavens’ rigid revolutions complete one cycle in 360 turns, while the earth’s terrestrial mechanisms advance one degree in 330 turns. The heavens’ 3,600 cycles constitute a Yang surge, and the earth’s 3,600 degrees constitute a Yin eclipse. When the heavens’ qi reaches its extreme, it becomes Great Yin; when the earth’s qi reaches its extreme, it becomes Great Yang. Thus, when Yang is stimulated, it surges; when Yin is obstructed, it eclipses. The surge and eclipse of Yin and Yang bring about the transformation of heaven and earth’s qi—this is called a minor kalpa. When minor kalpas intersect, the Ten Thousand Emperors change their positions, the Nine Qi alter their courses, and the sun and moon contract their revolutions. Yet this does not mention the *jiashen* cycle.\n\nHowever, in the *Great Peace Manuscript*, it is said that within the nine-six sequence, there must be major and minor *jiashen* cycles, with *jiashen* as the appointed time, when ghosts confront humanity. Though \"ghosts confronting humanity\" indicates the intersection of life and death, it does not specify *jiazi* or *jiayin*, focusing solely on *jiashen*—why? In my humble consideration, this refers to the transition of cyclical qi, where the cycle shifts but the kalpa has not yet ended, yet it is still called a kalpa. *Jiashen* thus marks the kalpa of cyclical transition.\n\nAccording to this scripture: \"The great cycle nears its end, the reckoning of *jiashen* draws to a close.\" It also states: \"The great reckoning has its appointed time, *jiashen* hangs in its final moment.\" And again: \"The great cycle begins its appointed time, the three and five announce the hour.\" Thus, though *jiashen* brings vast calamity, it is not truly a kalpa. For *jiashen* belongs to Water and occupies the *kun* position, with the Well constellation nearby, the meeting place of the Six Yin. According to Jin astronomical calculations, the Well contains eight stars, the celestial sentinels governing the affairs of the Water Balance. When the cycle reaches this point, how could it not bring a great flood? Thus, the deluge scours away filth, and calamities spread across the heavens—hence the mention of water but not fire. \"Scouring away filth\" means eliminating the wicked.\n\nThe scripture states: \"When the major and minor *jiashen* arrive, the malevolent are eradicated, and the virtuous are delivered. The virtuous become the seed people, while the malevolent become the chaff.\" Noble and virtuous ones, can you not strive?\n\nFrom the era of Crimson Brightness to the first year of the Supreme August, according to the *Primordial Yang Jade Treasury*, those who received deliverance numbered 240,000. Beyond the Six Harmonies, the sages preserve what they do not discuss, for it is difficult to fathom and measure.",

      "translated_text": "*The Jade Chapters of Spirit Generation* is a forbidden scripture of the Primordial Beginning, seldom heard by worldly people—thus, much is omitted in discussion. Regarding the epochs before and after kalpas, there must be a fixed account, yet worldly people inevitably fall into confusion and disorder.\n\nThis sutra states that in the first year of the Dragon Han kalpa, the Heavenly Treasure Lord was born. After the Heavenly Treasure Lord’s birth, the Dragon Han era first unfolded its charts, giving rise to the Numinous Treasure Lord. After one kalpa, in the first year of Crimson Brightness, the Numinous Treasure Lord began delivering people. At that time, the Divine Treasure Lord was born. After two kalpas, in the first year of the Supreme August, the Divine Treasure Lord first revealed the scriptures—such is the kalpic progression of this sutra.\n\nFrom the Dragon Han to Crimson Brightness, then to the Supreme August, the Yan Kang era is not mentioned. Yet if one examines the *Subtleties of the Great Mystery Dao*, before the end of a prior kalpa and the beginning of the next, during the time of primordial chaos, it is universally termed the Yan Kang. Thus, within the three kalpas of Dragon Han, Crimson Brightness, and Supreme August, how could there be no epochs before or after kalpas? Why is the Yan Kang kalpa entirely unmentioned?\n\nMoreover, the *Scripture of Salvation* states: \"Dragon Han and Yan Kang, boundless kalpas of remote antiquity,\" speaking of Yan Kang but omitting Crimson Brightness and Supreme August. Elsewhere, it places Yan Kang before Dragon Han. According to the *Scripture of Daoist Ordinals* and the *Primordial Record of Mount Gui*, only three kalpas are mentioned, and neither Supreme August nor Yan Kang are included.\n\nFurthermore, the Dragon Han is said to last only one year, while the Supreme August varies with accounts of three or eight years. Upon careful examination of the *Scripture of Salvation*, the sequence of Dragon Han, Crimson Brightness, Yan Kang, Kai Huang, and Supreme August aligns with the Five Phases, forming the order of five kalpas. Yet if this sutra’s account is taken as definitive—from Crimson Brightness to Supreme August, delivering 240,000 people, only then speaking of Kai Huang—it follows that Supreme August precedes Kai Huang. This diverges from the five-kalpa sequence, leaving scholars bewildered and uncertain. Those of discernment must investigate further.",

      "translated_text": "The Primordial Yang belongs to the Purple Tenuity Palace. The *Jade Casket* contains the \"Statutes of Illuminating the Real,\" which address good and evil. The Youth of Supreme Wisdom once inquired of the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning about the retribution of good and evil. Thereupon, the Celestial Venerable commanded the summoning of the flying divine beings from the ten directions to open the Nine Dark Jade Casket of the Long Night’s Repository and produce the \"Statutes of Illuminating the Real\" to deliver humankind. Thus began the Youth of Supreme Wisdom’s illumination of the statutes, which enumerate fourteen transgressions. Hence, the *Threefold Recorded Repentance* states: \"Manifesting the fourteen transgressions, it communicates the repentance of the Nine Dark Realms.\" In recent versions from the Central River region, these have been altered to the \"ten evils.\" Those who, ignorant of principle, presumptuously amend ritual texts seldom escape ridicule.\n\nAfter the Kai Huang era, when the count reaches *jiashen*, the heavens conduct their selection, the offices of immortals lie vacant, their ranks unfilled, and those in wandering appointments all await selection. Previously, *jiashen* was considered a minor kalpa; now, counting from the Kai Huang era to *jiashen* confirms that the *jiashen* kalpa is not singular. Precisely at the time when the kalpic destiny undergoes renewal, those immortals holding office must undergo selection, much like the worldly system of official assessment. That the offices of immortals lie vacant and their ranks unfilled reveals that those who do good are few, while those who do evil are many.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Treasure of the Dao* states: \"Even those who ascend to the Heavenly Paradise may yet fall, while those who descend to the Hells may still rise.\" The Lord of the Fixed Record said: \"Yesterday, at the Eastern Flower Assembly, I gathered the various Lords of Destiny, along with the local spirits and divine administrators, to examine the worldly records. I found that among the people of the world, not one in fifty does good—how much less among the immortals? Among ten thousand, scarcely one or two. Yet even among these, many who had achieved merit later fell from their ranks. I fear that soon there will be no one left to inherit the registers of immortality. Moreover, the era of deliverance presses near, and the age of calamity grows ever more urgent. Though I have seen in the Purple Register of the Eastern Flower’s upper ledger those listed as the highest of the highest immortals, five have already fallen, and two have been demoted to earthly immortal offices. None remain to fill their places. Of the upper-middle immortals, twenty-eight in number, seven have fallen, two have been demoted to lower immortals, five have been reduced to the rank of mortals, and only one has been promoted. Of the upper and lower immortals, three hundred in number, twenty-six have fallen, eleven have been demoted to earthly overseers, and fifteen have been reduced to the rank of mortals. From this, we may infer that the offices of immortals lie vacant indeed, and suitable candidates are scarce.\n\nThere are also those in wandering appointments who, through indolence and neglect, fail to fulfill their duties. The highest immortals among them fall to the rank of lower immortals, while the lower immortals fall to become earthly overseers, that they may repent, cultivate diligently, and thereby regain their former positions. In former times, the Lady of the Supreme Prime, who had attained the rank of Primordial Lord, failed to attend diligently to the imperial bureau, neglected her proper duties, transgressed ritual propriety in her comings and goings, lost decorum in courtly feasts, and carelessly divulged heavenly treasures. She was demoted to the rank of lower immortal, her register as a Perfected Sovereign expunged, and her office in the Purple Void revoked. Thus, even those whose blessings have brought them to the Heavenly Paradise may yet fall.\n\nThose appointed as wandering灵官 in the Middle Prime’s Pure Tenuity may, over seven hundred years, advance in rank according to their conduct. Thus, even those whose misfortunes have brought them to the Hells may yet rise. Those who have been selected for immortal office must guard their station with utmost vigilance.\n\nAccording to the *Primordial Yang Jade Calendar*, every three generations a review is conducted. Those who have set their hearts on accumulating goodness and building merit, who are commended by the Three Realms and protected by the Five Emperors, and whose names are recorded in the heavens, shall be chosen—one hundred thousand to fulfill their duties. Additionally, another one hundred twenty thousand shall be selected to serve as reserve officials. Previously, this was called the *Primordial Yang Jade Casket*; here, it is termed the *Primordial Yang Jade Calendar*. The *Jade Casket* assesses the good and evil of deceased souls, while the *Jade Calendar* records merit. At the juncture when kalpic destinies intersect, those who are to assume office among the immortal bureaus shall be recorded in the *Jade Calendar*.\n\nThe \"three generations\" do not refer to the Three Dynasties of high antiquity, but rather to the Xia, Shang, and Zhou. *Zhuangzi* also states: \"From the Three Dynasties onward, how clamorous it has become!\" For clamor signifies the multiplication of affairs, which must then be managed. Those who set their hearts on accumulating goodness and merit need not fear the lack of protection from the Three Realms or the commendation of the Five Emperors. Yet goodness is not accumulated in a single day, nor does merit come in a single moment. Thus, those whose names are recorded in the heavens have long been destined in the unseen, to be commended in due time.

      "translated_text": "Those who have yet to fully attain the fruit of the Dao, though their blessings remain unexhausted, may first manifest a body of *parinirvāṇa*, thereafter to be transformed into immortals. In former times, Zheng Anren was born in the world of Chanli. At three days old, he could speak and already knew his past lives. By the age of twelve, his face radiated jade-like light. Forsaking the world and leaving behind worldly customs, he wandered far into the mountains and forests. When the time came for his *parinirvāṇa*, he died in the northern Rong lands of He, his corpse left exposed for over thirty years. Yet his form did not decay to ash. Only in the third year of the Red Brightness era, the year *bingwu*, did he at last attain the fruit of realization and receive the title *Cinnabar Spirit Venerable Lord*.\n\nSome achieve this through wholehearted devotion to the Three Treasures, their meritorious deeds piercing the heavens. To give life to heaven and earth, to make gods of ghosts and emperors of spirits—this is the Dao. And what is the Dao? It is the Three Treasures. Their merit blankets the world yet does not claim itself; they transform and bestow upon the ten thousand things yet do not rely on them. How could the Three Treasures, in their humility, seek human devotion? The scriptures say: \"To devote oneself to the scriptures of the Three Treasures yet not to the practices of the Three Treasures—those are they; we are we. What benefit is there in this?\" It further states: \"Merit piercing the heavens arises only from wholehearted devotion to the practices of the Three Treasures.\" Yet few realize that the Three Treasures are none other than one’s own true self. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"The Perfected One resides within you—why ask your neighbor?\" This is precisely where the ancients did not deceive their hearts.\n\nThe so-called Three Treasures are the conquest of greed, anger, and delusion. According to the *Scripture of the Inner Secret Treasury*: \"When the nature of nobility is quiescent and free from the dust of defilement, when precepts are unbroken—this is called the *Dharma Treasure*. When the nature of anger does not arise and one is not enraged by external dust, when concentration is free from birth and change—this is called the *Teacher Treasure*. When the nature of delusion does not grasp, when there is no vexation and no rest, when wisdom flows unimpeded—this is called the *Dao Treasure*.\" These Three Treasures are neither internal nor external, neither sound nor form. How could devotion to them be in vain? If greed, anger, and delusion are absent, then the Three Poisons are extinguished. Once the Three Poisons are destroyed, the Three Treasures appear before you. Meritorious deeds become manifest, and one’s faith is confirmed in piercing the heavens to become an immortal. Thus it is said: \"In delusion, one wanders the Three Realms; in awakening, one enters the Three Clarities.\"\n\nOthers are praised by the Three Officials for their veneration of the Teacher Treasure. There are Teachers of the Heavenly Treasure and Teachers of the Worldly Treasure. Together, they are called *Teachers*—the root. The virtue of life and growth depends on the kindness of parents and the guidance of teachers; without teachers, nothing is accomplished. In ancient times, scholars who encountered a worthy teacher were said to be \"reborn\"; without a worthy teacher, they were said to \"confound the scriptures.\" All who study the Dao rely on teachers for transmission. The teacher of Lord Lao was the Supreme Dao Lord; the teacher of the Supreme Dao Lord was the Primordial Beginning. Even the sages of precelestial origin required teachers—how much more so do ordinary people? Veneration means turning toward their gate, serving with diligence and enduring hardship without exception. Only then do the Three Officials praise them, recording their merit and movement, for they have not forgotten their root. The ancients bowed to trees to ascend as immortals and prostrated before mountains to attain the Dao. How could the Teacher Treasure not bring about accomplishment?\n\nStill others accumulate merit and resonance through fasting and upholding precepts. Fasting is the purification of the heart; precepts are the prevention of harm. There are two kinds of fasting: one for the ultimate Dao, the other for salvation. The ultimate Dao refers to those who, from the beginning to the end of their Dao-seeking, maintain fasting without retreat in every thought. This has two aspects: forgetting the heart and extinguishing the heart. Forgetting the heart means that from start to finish, one directs the mind, sitting and moving without attachment to form, as still as dead ashes, like withered wood, extinguishing appearances and thoughts until only the One remains. Extinguishing the heart means that with each arising thought, one forgets it, the spirit moving without hindrance, the mind returning to quiescence until reaching the Dao-field.\n\nSalvation refers to turning the heart toward the Dao, yearning for the mysterious and true, wishing to bestow blessings and wisdom to deliver all beings. One guards the body with precepts, preventing all afflictions from entering, so that body and mind are at peace and together enter the truth of the Dao. With long accumulation, one can move the Five Spirits. The scriptures say: \"Accumulated resonance leads to spiritual penetration.\" The *Scripture of Cave Mystery Precepts* states: \"Once there were twenty-six thousand Daoists who upheld fasting and precepts, their minds single and unwavering, cultivating in accord with the Dharma. After twelve years, the Earth Bureau recommended them, memorializing their names to the heavens. After a hundred years, they ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\"",

With inner and outer peace, all misfortunes dissolve.”\n\nThus the Dharma includes the offering of life, breaking through miserly hearts. The mysterious power of the sages penetrates unseen, and retribution follows merit.\n\nAs for establishing Dao halls, the *Sutra of the Wondrous Dharma’s Original Form* records: The Supreme Mystery Purple Void Perfected One was originally King Binling of the Black Mound Kingdom.

      "translated_text": "Having ascended to the throne of the Black Mound Kingdom, he thereafter further cultivated the Dao of ascending as an immortal and attained the rank of the Mystery Purple Void Perfected One. Thus considered, if the act of bestowing alms upon Daoists yields such principle, how much greater must the merit be if one extends charity to the poor and destitute? Some rescue and relieve the impoverished, ferrying both celestial and mortal beings across suffering. Disparity between wealth and poverty is the nature of things, yet the mutual succor of rich and poor is the constant principle of the Way. Within a single village, there must be those who are wealthy, upon whom the poor rely for relief. If the rich are miserly and unkind, then why has Heaven made them wealthy? What use are they? This may be mirrored in the recent parable of the boatman who ferried grain across the river to transform the land.\n\nThe scripture states: *\"To rescue and relieve the destitute is to ferry celestial and mortal beings across suffering.\"* All people are children of Heaven; should they fall into misfortune and receive the grace of another’s aid, what greater act could there be? The *True Statutes and Decrees of the Most High* declares: *\"To save and relieve ten people unto life fulfills all vows, ensuring the protection of one’s family across the rivers of existence. If such kindness extends for ten years or more, the entire household shall attain immortal longevity.\"* The term \"ferrying across\" signifies that one’s virtue is weighty—those in destitution rely upon it for survival, just as the earth bears all things and a boat ferries people to safety.\n\nIn former times, Xu Ying studied the Dao upon Red Mountain. Before his cultivation was complete, the Left Minister of the Three Offices dispatched the Registrar Hou Fang and the Enforcer of Transgressions Yan Baihu to Red Mountain, where they seized Ying and prepared to interrogate him for his crimes. Fortunately, a divine messenger hastened to inform the Controller of Destinies, who immediately sent the Central Attendant Li Zun, wielding a fire-bell, to rebuke and disperse them. Thus, Fang and Baihu fled in disarray. Before Li Zun’s arrival, Ying had been seized with terror, his qi nearly depleted. He also relied upon Gong Chujie and Li Kailin to assist in his defense, narrowly averting disaster. Fang’s accusations were not without basis, yet Ying’s responses were precise.\n\nThe Three Offices produced a red tablet, a sin tablet, and a ledger of transgressions, questioning Ying: *\"One who aspires to study the Dao and emulate the immortals, who holds the profound heart of the mysterious and reveres the lofty spirits, ought to have accumulated worldly merit, avoided calamity, and allowed virtue to take root in the unseen, with seven generations of blessings ascending to the heavens—only then may one ascend as a Perfected One of the Pristine and Pure and cross into the Clear Mansion. Yet you, with your own hands, slew Xie Gong, disrupting the harmony of the Three Luminaries. You beheaded Li Qi to substitute for Cai Zhi’s execution, slaughtered She Fanmu and others, dismembered Cao Biao of the Bell Chamber, drowned Tang Yun’s corpse in talismanic water, burned Xu Ang’s remains, strangled Huan Zheng, and butchered Zhen Qiang—forty-three acts of cruelty, violence, and indiscriminate punishment. Your litany of grievances has reached the Celestial Emperor, your transgressions piled high as mountains, while not a single good deed stands to your name. Moreover, you originally followed the Way of the Silk Clan, consuming the blood and flesh of living beings, hastening to repay your karmic debts, your name already recorded in the registers of the Three Offices. Yet you transgressed the proper order, pledging yourself to the true qi, with father and son in the same household each serving different masters, living in discord and refusing to share in the libations—your offenses are grave, and the unseen judgment is already being meted out. With such accumulated sins, how could there be immortality for you? How dare you deceive the courts of the Most High and inscribe your name in the Purple Register of the Undying?\"*\n\nYing replied: *\"The Dao of Heaven is impartial, favoring only the good. Heaven and Earth are without intent, yet they show compassion to those of virtue. Thus, when the Ban Spring flowed with blood, it did not hinder the dragon’s majestic rise; when the Three Miao dyed the fields red at Zhuolu, did it obstruct the divine transformations of the great sages? My ancestor of ten generations past, Xu Zi’a, accumulated benevolence and manifested virtue, extending his kindness even to birds and beasts. In years of famine and plague, when the people starved and disease raged, leaving barely one in a hundred alive, Zi’a’s family possessed vast wealth. He personally prepared medicinal remedies, tirelessly aiding those beyond his household. At the death of others, he grieved as if losing his own kin; in the suffering of others, he agonized as if afflicted himself. Lives on the brink of death were saved by his hands, and in years of dire poverty, he nurtured the destitute as his own children. Four hundred and eight people survived the famine by his grace. His benevolence and virtue were such that they were destined to descend upon us, inscribing his merit in the records of the Celestial Emperor and carving his name upon the sacred tablets. Five of us were born with an affinity for immortality, three have already ascended, and our names are inscribed in the Azure Palace of the Most High upon the bound jade tablets—how could the likes of you presume to interfere?\"*\n\nExamining Xu Ying’s past lives, his good and evil deeds were evenly matched at fifteen each. Yet by virtue of Zi’a’s accumulated benevolence and manifested virtue, he was delivered from the pursuit of the Three Offices, nearly escaping the jaws of disaster. Thereafter, his name was recorded in the Eastern Palace, and his goodness was sufficient to outweigh his transgressions. Alas! A single good deed within a person can eradicate a hundred evils—this is no empty saying.\n\nSome become the Three Masters, their merit complete and their names recorded in the celestial registers. The master who transmits the scriptures is called the *Ferrying Master*; the master of the Ferrying Master is called the *Register Master*; and the master of the Register Master is called the *Scripture Master*—these are the Three Masters. They are the great ancestral teachers of past ages, the spiritual parents of later generations. If one upholds and propagates the true teaching, widely establishes fields of merit, transforms and ferries sentient beings, and continues the lineage of the sacred flame, cherishing their memory as if standing before their ancestral temple—this is truly the accomplishment of merit.\n\nThough the Three Masters may have passed into the distant past, their virtuous influence endures unbroken, perpetuated by later generations. The Supreme Ultimate Void Perfected One asked the Most High Lord Lao: *\"Formerly, I received the sacred teaching, which exhorted men and women to diligently cultivate merit. I am unsure what constitutes merit.\"* The Most High Lord Lao replied: *\"Exerting oneself in virtuous action is called *merit*; when merit extends to others, it is called *virtue*. If one’s merit is complete, one’s name will be recorded in the celestial registers—this is certain.\"*\n\nIn former times, Xie Chongji was a Daoist of Mount Hua. He had no other merit but the practice of burning incense, offering three hundred censers each day without fail.",

      "original_text": "以粱开平元年三月二日朝，有二青童下迎而去，此其功充足之证也。 古者三师不过经、籍、度三师。 《玉录经》存三师之法甚明，前辈以为定式。 自后巢时宾加为五师，是谓分上安分也。 《定制集》 中有玄中法师，又有监斋法师，即不知二者即一矣。 所谓二五为十，不知五五乃十也。 考算簿录，三官相应，皆逆注种民，上下有别，毫分无遗。 三元有三官，分为九官，总二十七府、百二十曹。 左阳生官，右阴死官。 左府青簿，书有功者，右府黑簿，书有罪者。 若罪中涉福，福中涉罪，不专於一曹也。 所以辖实其事。 有三年之考，有九年之考，二十四年考。 三官相应者，其功罪与三府一同，前后不差，方行奏列。 至於逆注种民，切缘开皇之后，至於甲申，官僚不充，又别举一十二万人以为储官。 则种民之数，其额未敷。 虽有善未足者，亦令入种民之数，谓之逆注。 《八素真经》曰：服日月之法，得其道者，皆青官逆注於未生之前，乃知大道奖进之门，嘉善而矜。 不能善之熟者，在所奖进，善之不熟者，犹所矜怜也。 又九幽之府，被东华青宫九龙符命，使拔九幽玉匮男女死魂，宿名有善功德满足，应受开度者，取三十二万人，以充甲申驱除之后，开大有之民。 北都罗酆为天官所治，泉曲河源为水官所治，九幽地狱即地官所治。 若九幽乃罪之大者，宜乎无应受开度之人。 缘甲申之劫，当行驱除，人之死者，靡有孑遗。 於是东华青官又有九龙符命，下辟九幽之狱，拣择功德之魂。 东华青宫，按《黄炁阳精经》云：乃扶桑洞阳也。 得入此宫，结为飞仙。 《太霄琅书》云：凡有四极明科之身，四司五帝列兆之名，上言青宫。 乃知东华者，主领生籍也。 大有之民，号曰更生。 故《紫文上经》云：涉乎三灾而不伤。 又曰：必观更生於太平。 然则太平即大有无疑也。 当此之时，生死交会，善恶分判，得过者真为乐哉。 乐莫大於长生，知生为可乐而不能修。 忧莫大於一死，知死为可忧而不能避。 非生之远人，人自远也。 善人天地之纪，恶人天地之贼，善者即修生之本也。 舜始乎匹夫，舍己从人以为善，真积力久，王於天下，后至登仙，位为太极真人，则知为善可乐。 正当生死交会，善恶分判之时，若无善功以为凭籍，未免糜渍其 躯，流离苦海。 总真王君曰：往返三涂中，良由自苦辛。 可不为大哀耶。 然三官相切，文墨纷纭，龙门受会，鸟母督仙，万圣显驾，昼夜无间，功过平等，使生死无偏。 此之昏闹，亦臣之忧矣。 大期既切，触事阙替，恒恐一旦，受罹公门。 有天下者为天下忧，有一身者为一身忧。 天下之与身，所忧虽不同，其於忧则一也。 飞天神人总御生死，所忧犹大於天下。 当甲申之期，有功者举之，有恶者罚之。 又有万圣显驾於太空之中，使功过平等，宜乎无忧，而云此之昏闹，亦臣之忧矣。 其所忧者，恐善善者未彰，恶恶者不显，有亏公道，故曰昏闹。 恒恐一旦受罹公门。 且三官相切，文墨纷纭者，言簿书之多也。 龙门受会，鸟母督仙，言洪灾也。 《淮南子》曰：龙门未辟，吕梁未凿，河出孟门之上，大溢逆流，无有丘陵高阜，灭之名曰洪水。 按《水经》龙门在河东猗氏县，即《书》云导河积石至于龙门是也。",
      "translated_text": "On the second day of the third month in the first year of the Liang Kaiping era, two azure lads descended to welcome him away—this was proof of his merit’s fulfillment.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Masters referred only to the Masters of Scriptures, Registers, and Ordination. The *Jade Registers Scripture* clearly preserves the methods of the Three Masters, which former worthies regarded as the established model. Later, during the time of Chao Shibin, two more were added to make Five Masters—this was merely a division of roles. The *Compendium of Fixed Regulations* includes the Master of the Mysterious Center and the Master of Ritual Supervision, yet it remains unclear whether these two are one and the same. They speak of \"two fives making ten,\" unaware that \"five fives also make ten.\"\n\nExamining the ledgers of the Three Offices, all records correspond in reverse to the Seed People, with distinctions between high and low, not a hairbreadth overlooked. The Three Primes have Three Offices, divided into Nine Offices, comprising twenty-seven bureaus and one hundred twenty departments. The left, Yang Office of Life records those with merit in its green ledgers; the right, Yin Office of Death records those with transgressions in its black ledgers. If within transgression there is merit, or within merit there is transgression, they are not confined to a single department. Thus, the facts are verified.\n\nThere are triennial reviews, nine-year reviews, and twenty-four-year reviews. When the Three Offices concur, their records of merit and transgression align with those of the Three Bureaus, with no discrepancy before or after, and only then are they submitted for imperial consideration. As for the reverse registration of the Seed People, it was particularly implemented after the Kaihuang era, extending to the Jia-Shen year, when the official ranks were insufficient. Thus, an additional one hundred twenty thousand were selected as reserve officials. The quota for the Seed People was not yet filled, so even those whose merit was incomplete were allowed to enter their number, termed \"reverse registration.\"\n\nThe *Eightfold Pure True Scripture* states: Those who practice the methods of the sun and moon and attain the Dao are all reverse-registered in the Azure Office before their birth, for the Great Dao’s gate of advancement rewards the good and pities the incapable. Even those whose goodness is not yet mature are still advanced; those whose goodness is immature are still pitied.\n\nMoreover, the Nine Dark Prisons received the Nine Dragon Talisman Mandate from the Eastern Azure Palace, commanding the release of the male and female souls of the dead whose names are recorded in the Jade Caskets of the Nine Darks, whose accumulated merit and virtue are complete and who are due for deliverance. Thirty-two thousand were selected to replenish the ranks after the Jia-Shen purgation, becoming the people of the Great Possession.\n\nThe Northern Capital of Fengdu is governed by the Celestial Office; the Springs of Qu and the Sources of He are governed by the Aquatic Office; the Nine Dark Hells are governed by the Terrestrial Office. Though the Nine Darks are the greatest of transgressions, there should be none eligible for deliverance. Yet during the Jia-Shen cataclysm, when the purgation was carried out, the dead were annihilated without exception. Thus, the Eastern Azure Palace issued another Nine Dragon Talisman Mandate to open the Nine Dark Prisons and select souls of merit.\n\nThe Eastern Azure Palace, according to the *Scripture of Yellow Qi and Yang Essence*, is the Cavern Yang of Fusang. Those who enter this palace become flying immortals. The *Luminous Writ of the Grand Empyrean* states: All who possess the body of the Four Poles’ Bright Statutes and the names listed by the Four Directors and Five Thearchs are recorded in the Azure Palace above. Thus, the Eastern Azure is known to preside over the Registers of Life.\n\nThe people of the Great Possession are called the Reborn. Therefore, the *Upper Scripture of Purple Text* says: They traverse the Three Calamities unharmed. It also says: They must witness rebirth in the Great Peace. Thus, the Great Peace is undoubtedly the Great Possession.\n\nAt this time, life and death converge, good and evil are judged, and those who pass through truly find joy. No joy surpasses longevity, yet knowing life is joyous, they do not cultivate it. No sorrow surpasses death, yet knowing death is sorrowful, they do not avoid it. It is not that life is distant from people; people distance themselves from life. The good are the threads of heaven and earth; the evil are the thieves of heaven and earth. The good are the foundation of cultivating life.\n\nShun began as a commoner, relinquishing self to follow others in goodness. Through true accumulation and prolonged effort, he reigned over the world, later ascending to immortality and attaining the rank of Supreme Ultimate Perfected One. Thus, it is known that goodness brings joy. Precisely at the convergence of life and death, when good and evil are judged, without merit as one’s credential, one cannot escape the dissolution of the body and the suffering of the bitter sea.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of the Assembly of All Truths said: \"To and fro within the Three Paths, truly by one’s own bitter toil.\" Is this not cause for great lament? Yet the Three Offices are exacting, their documents profuse. The Dragon Gate receives the assembly, the Bird Mother supervises the immortals, the ten thousand sages manifest their presence day and night without pause, weighing merit and transgression equally, ensuring no bias in life and death. This confusion and clamor are also my concern.\n\nThe great reckoning is imminent, and in every matter, there are omissions. I constantly fear that one day I may be ensnared in the public tribunal. Those who possess the world worry for the world; those who possess only themselves worry for themselves. Though the world and the self differ in what they worry over, their worry is the same. The flying celestial beings who govern life and death bear even greater worry than the world.\n\nAt the Jia-Shen reckoning, those with merit are promoted, and those with transgression are punished. Moreover, the ten thousand sages manifest in the vastness of the heavens, ensuring the equal weighing of merit and transgression. There should be no worry, yet it is said this confusion and clamor are also my concern. What I worry over is that the good may not be fully recognized, the evil may not be fully exposed, and public justice may be compromised—hence the term \"confusion and clamor.\" I constantly fear that one day I may be ensnared in the public tribunal.\n\nFurthermore, the Three Offices are exacting, their documents profuse—this refers to the multitude of records. The Dragon Gate receiving the assembly and the Bird Mother supervising the immortals refer to the great flood. The *Master Huainan* states: Before the Dragon Gate was opened and Lüliang was carved, the Yellow River issued from above Meng Gate, flooding in reverse, submerging all hills and mounds—this was called the Great Flood. According to the *Water Classic*, the Dragon Gate is in Yi County of Hedong, which is the \"leading the river from the accumulated stones to the Dragon Gate\" mentioned in the *Book of Documents*.",

      "translated_text": "Yet the Dragon Gate is indeed the confluence where the world’s river sources gather. The jia-shen year marks the appointed time of the great flood, when the waters of the four seas first assemble here, fixed to the day of the kalpic cycle, before the deluge swells to engulf heaven and earth, sparing neither high nor low.\n\nAt that time, the goodly seed-people who escape the flood are those whom the Bird Mother, a spirit of the waters, bears aloft in a phoenix chariot to the slopes of Kunlun. Thus the *Scripture of the Five Elders for Averting the Great Kalpa* states: “The nine rivers receive their reckoning; the flood surges through the streams; the Water Mother lingers; bird and steed gather in flocks.” The Lady of Supreme Perfection also speaks of “the eight qi steaming over mountains and marshes, the shifting sands damming the source-mouths.” Thereupon the four seas converge, the dragon hosts dance, and in the jia-shen year the dark flood will soar and flow backward. Every affair is neglected and in disarray—as the *Scripture of the Seventy-Four Methods* says, “Matters remain untouched, yet the turning of fate has its proper cause; still, they must be carried out.” Wherever one turns, matters press yet remain unaddressed; only the kalpic flood is cause for dread.\n\nI have heard that the Heavenly Worthy, in creating a transformation of great compassion, takes pity on the teeming masses and opens the mysteries of the Nine Heavens to succor the myriad people. The luminous statutes contain prohibitions and precepts, which a humble servant such as I may not presume to hear in full. Yet the great reckoning has its appointed time, and the jia-shen year draws near its close; the movement of fate is swift and urgent, and the great Dharma should be put into practice. The *Scripture of Jade Purity* teaches four methods of cultivation, with compassion foremost. The *Hidden Book of Jade Purity* lists nine traces of the master, with great compassion as the first. “I possess three treasures,” it is said, “and the first is compassion.” Thus we know that compassion is not the sole possession of sages—all people possess it. Only the sage first attains the rectitude of my heart, expands and fulfills it, so that it pervades all things, and there is nothing that does not rely on its grace.\n\nNow, as the jia-shen year nears its end, it is precisely the time when the great Dharma should be practiced. If we set aside compassion and fail to broaden it, how can we save each and every person? The luminous statutes contain prohibitions and precepts, stating that the statutes of the Luminous Perfected have six time limits for transmission: first, once every forty thousand kalpas; second, once every forty thousand years; third, once every four thousand years; fourth, once every four hundred years; fifth, once every forty years; sixth, once every four cycles. When the kalpic cycle reaches its end, the Dharma may be transmitted to one person. Yet the movement of fate is swift and the hour urgent; with great compassion and broad salvation, the Dharma is transmitted upon encountering the worthy, without regard to fixed numbers. Thus those of sincere heart may, within the reckoning of calculations, hear the sound of the Dharma, have it revealed to their sight and hearing, and be exhorted and transformed before they awaken.",

      "translated_text": "Fearing to offend the celestial countenance with these supplications above, I humbly beseech your compassion and grant me what I have yet to hear.\n\nThe elders once said: \"With intent, one may attain the Dao; yet without intent, one may attain it more readily.\" These two lines have been expounded in myriad ways, yet none have made them clear. In my foolish view, how could one attain the Dao without intent? If one were without intent, how would one differ from wood or stone?\n\nThose who study the Dao need only prepare the heart to receive it—whether they gain it or lose it, they leave it to its own course. What is called \"without intent\" means without *this* intent. As soon as one’s heart is bound to gain or loss, the heart is no longer single-minded. If the heart is not single-minded, even a hundred artisans in their workshops may achieve their craft, but in the Dao, how distant they remain!\n\nNow, the scripture’s purport is that those with intent draw near to cultivating goodness, yet without beholding the Dharma-gate, they cannot enter, though they strive. Though they have ears and eyes to hear and see, none of it is real; they practice without attachment, habituate without discernment. Were it not for revelation to their sight and hearing, exhortation to awaken and enter, they would spend their lives following it without knowing—such are the many.\n\nThus, the Flying Celestial Divine King, undeterred by the transgression of offending heaven, within the reckoning of calculations, enables those with intent to escape the great calamity of the kalpic cycle. Is not his intent vast indeed?\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy stroked the table, raised his voice in lofty resolve, composed his spirit in distant contemplation, and intoned the Cavernous Chapters, chanting their jade-like resonance. After a long while, he suddenly sighed and said: \"The supreme model is empty and silent, its principle subtle and profoundly obscure; the Dao reaches the double mystery, its qi crowns the Divine Empyrean. Its utmost is difficult to express, its wonder difficult to surpass.\"\n\nBefore the Flying Celestial Divine King entreated the *Jade Chapters of Spirit-Generation*, the Heavenly Worthy first sighed, saying the Dao’s methods are lofty and wondrous, not to be attained in haste. Thus, he stroked the table—this gesture showed a willingness to engage below—while raising his voice in lofty resolve, as if to suggest that the profound could not be fully plumbed. Composing his spirit in distant contemplation, he intoned the Cavernous Chapters, chanting their jade-like resonance.\n\nThis entire passage relies on the Shangqing transformative *Scripture of the Seventy-Four Methods*. When the Lord of Longevity and Controller of Destiny entreated the *Scripture of the Seventy-Four Methods*, he first declared: \"Though my affairs are unworthy, fate has its good reasons. To encounter the Heavenly Worthy is the fortune of a lifetime. I know not what to say; I humbly beseech your compassion and grant me perfection in the real.\" Thereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy stroked the table, raised his voice to the great void, and after a long while, showed a willingness to engage below. The wording of the inquiry differs slightly, but the principle is largely the same.\n\nComposing the spirit prevents the arising of afflictions; distant contemplation allows the heart to wander in the harmony of primordial virtue. The *Cavernous Chapters* are the great cavern’s verses. \"Chanting their jade-like resonance\" describes the sound’s reverberation. After long entreaty, he lamented: \"The supreme model is empty and silent, its principle subtle and profoundly obscure; the Dao reaches the double mystery, its qi crowns the Divine Empyrean.\" This refers to the *Scripture of Spirit-Generation*.\n\nYet the *Chapters of Spirit-Generation* are the numinous script formed by the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery. Its model is empty and vast, its principles remote and profound; its Dao truly crowns the double mystery, its qi originates from the Divine Empyrean. Though the kalpic cycle nears its end and the scripture should be proclaimed to the world, revealing it to sight and hearing, exhorting the unawakened, its purport is most ultimate and wondrous—beyond the reach of lesser immortals and inferior adepts. Thus, it is said: \"Its utmost is difficult to express, its wonder difficult to surpass.\" These two lines sigh for the preceding text.\n\nThe Divine Empyrean is one of the Nine Heavens. This differs from the Nine Empyreans in the *Rites of the Divine Empyrean* of recent times and the *Biographies of Guest Immortals*; those with discernment will know this for themselves.\n\n\"Since you hold the imperial office, bearing the charge of Divine King, your wings of flight soar through the jade towers, the Four Ministers assist the luminous wheel. Your gaze extends to the farthest reaches, governing the boundless; you harmonize the myriad transformations, tending to the multitudes of the living.\"\n\n\"Since you hold the imperial office\"—this refers to the Divine King, as spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. In the earlier passage, the Divine King himself said, \"Your humble servant has had the fortune to attend your numinous chariot.\" Now to address him as holding the imperial office—is this not an advancement beyond his station?\n\nSince the teachings of Great Peace were bestowed, affairs have multiplied beyond those of the Three Dynasties. Thus, he is called the Later Sage and Imperial Lord, and not for a single reason. A great mansion is not supported by a single timber; the world is not governed by one man—how much more so the onerous affairs of the Three Realms’ life and death?\n\nThe Flying Celestial Divine King holds the rank of Divine King and the office of Emperor. Thus, the scripture says: \"He governs life and death, encompasses the celestial immortals, oversees the Seven Awakenings, and gazes into distant lands.\" From this, we see that he is called Divine King for his unfathomable nature, Emperor for his governance of life and death—Divine and Emperor are, in truth, one.\n\n\"Your wings of flight soar through the jade towers, the Four Ministers assist the luminous wheel.\" This speaks of the Flying Celestial Divine King, who constantly traverses the Three Realms, governing ghosts and spirits. When one merit is achieved and goodness advanced, his virtue and deeds truly equal those of the Later Sage, thus he assists in the jade towers.\n\nAccording to the *Commentary on the Thirty-Nine Sections*, the Jade Tower is in the Palace of Supreme Tenuity, the celestial emperor’s jade abode.

      "translated_text": "Now, I entrust this to you—strive with diligence.\n\nAs previously stated, the great cycle nears its appointed end, its reckoning concluding in the *jiashen* year. Today, the great cycle has begun its appointed time; the Three and Five announce the hour. The phrase \"the great cycle has begun its appointed time\" may refer to the era of Yao, when the *jiashen* year drew to a close amid the calamity of the Great Flood. \"The Three and Five announce the hour\" may signify the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. Such are the words handed down through tradition, though they are not recorded in the scriptures.\n\nMoreover, the *Purple Texts of the Upper Canon* states: \"In the years following the Tang, the accumulated reckoning reaches forty-six. At the close of *dinghai*, amid the interval before and after, in the twentieth year of the Horse, the mandate of the state shall be twice exhausted. East and West shall contend for hegemony to uphold the sovereign, giving rise to the names of the Nine and the One.\" Furthermore, the son of the Round-Eyed Sun Mirror, who establishes his reign and extends the radiance of peace, or the descendants of Changyuan in the *jiashen* year—such words approach the enigmatic language of the *geng* oracles, making their truth difficult to ascertain. Others interpret the Three and Five as the convergence of yin and yang in the cyclical flow of *qi*, yet no single explanation prevails.\n\nIf we turn to the *Upper Canon of the Phoenix Terrace and Plain Silk*, it is said:\n*\"The great kalpa reaches its destined end,\nAs the cycles of the Two Images incline.\nThe Dragon Gate severs, the Celestial River runs dry,\nThe Three and Five turn against one another in strife.\"*\nThis, as an explanation of yin and yang, seems closer to the mark.\n\nThe *Hundred and Six* refers to the cycle of great floods. Thus, \"the Hundred and Six respond to the mechanism, the Yang Nine stirs and surges, the vast springs churn waves, myriad calamities assail the heavens.\" If the Hundred and Six signifies flood disasters, and below it speaks of \"the vast springs churn waves,\" while between them it mentions \"the Yang Nine stirs and surges,\" what is the reason?\n\nThe Lady of Supreme Perfection, Wang, states: \"The Yang Nine brings great drought, the seas surge while the land scorches. The Hundred and Six dries the seas, and the valleys fill of their own accord.\" If it is a flood disaster, the waters must first gather at the mouths of the Nine Rivers, converging at their appointed time before overflowing, thus causing the seas to recede. From this, the surging of the seas in the Yang Nine is also evident. Some say: the seas recede only when the yang *qi* excites them, hence it is called \"the Yang Nine stirs and surges.\"\n\nThe Four Offices are: for men, Tongchu and Xiaoxian; for women, Yiqian and Hanzhen. These four offices are governed by the Huayang region of Mount Tong. \"You must labor for the multitudes, wearying yourself for the Three Offices\"—this aligns with the *Immortals’ Tales of Yongcheng*, which states: \"The Three Heavens gleam in their oversight, while the Bureau of Yin wearies in its investigations.\" The rise and fall refer to the great cycle beginning its appointed time, the *jiashen* year drawing to a close. It is precisely at this moment that one must exert effort to ensure the clear distinction between good and evil. Now, with this commission, strive with diligence.\n\nThe treasured scriptures are wondrous and weighty, the numinous sounds of the Nine Heavens, bestowed upon the exalted sages, not to be heard by ghosts or spirits. The standards of the Illuminated Perfected are set, transmitted but once in forty thousand kalpas. Now, in defiance of the prohibitions, I pass this to you—guard it well, and take care not to transmit it lightly.\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating Spirits* was originally the chapter bestowed by the Most High Jade Emperor of Primordial Beginning, received from the natural order. Those who study its verses ascend at once to the rank of Perfected Sovereign. Its mysteries are profound and weighty, like the heights of the Nine Heavens—this is the meaning of its wonder and the difficulty of transcending it. The divine chapters are the *qi* of soaring mystery, their sounds formed through three harmonies, hence they are called the \"numinous sounds\" and the \"standards of the Illuminated Perfected,\" as explained earlier.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy bestowed this upon the Flying Celestial Divine King—could it be that master and disciple were unworthy of such a transmission? Yet it speaks of defying prohibitions in passing it on; in the exchange of receiving and bestowing, can one not be reverent?\n\nThe Celestial Marshal of the Nine Heavens, the Jade Gentleman Attendant of Immortals, opened the cloud-brocade satchel of the Purple Yang Jade Slips and brought forth the *Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating Spirits*. The Four Assistants took their positions, the Five Elders oversaw the Perfected, the Great One commanded the hour, and the Jade Emperor intoned the covenant. All followed the rites of the *Illuminated Perfected Compendium*, facing south in prostration to bestow it upon the Flying Celestial Divine King of the Infinite. When the ritual was complete, the hosts of heaven returned to their stations.\n\nThe name of the Celestial Marshal appears frequently in the scriptures. It is also said to be the Jade Gentleman Attendant of Immortals, an official in charge of the canon. The *Hidden Decisions* states that the Nine Palaces of Jade Clarity, Highest Clarity, Supreme Ultimate, and Great Clarity each have their own officials and attendants. The *Exegesis of the Wondrous Canon of the Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating Spirits* mentions dukes, marquises, and ministers—these must refer to the officials of the Jade Clarity Palace.\n\nThe Purple Yang Jade Slips are contained in a cloud-brocade satchel. There are also the Jade Slips of Yulin and the cloud-brocade satchels. The Purple Yang is the repository of the scriptures, while the cloud-brocade is the satchel that holds them. Formerly, the Great Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate bestowed the *Scripture of Divine Radiance and Mystic Transformation* upon the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, wrapping it once in a cloud-brocade satchel. The Central Yellow Supreme Emperor of the Great One bestowed the *Twelve Scrolls of the Nine Vermilion Talismans* upon the Lord of Longevity and Controller of Destinies of the Southern Culmen, also sealing them in a cloud-brocade satchel.\n\nThe Four Assistants took their positions, the Five Elders oversaw the Perfected, the Great One commanded the hour, and the Jade Emperor intoned the covenant. Taking their positions establishes hierarchy; overseeing the Perfected encompasses their numbers; commanding the hour selects the proper day and time; intoning the covenant is to take oaths binding the Three Realms. The *Inner Scripture of the Perfected of the Five Emperors* states: \"Without a covenant, there is no transmission; without proper exchange, both giver and receiver lose their authenticity. The responsibility for life and death lies in adhering to the text and upholding it.\"\n\nIf we consider this in terms of the individual, the Four Assistants are the spirits of the two hands and two feet. The Five Elders are: the first, Baiyuan; the second, Wuying; the third, Taojun; the fourth, Siming; and the fifth, Taiyi—these are the Five Elders. Taiyi is the spirit of the womb and embryo, while the Jade Emperor is the spirit within the Muddy Pellet. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: \"The peak within heaven is reverently cultivated; when the numinous dwelling is purified, the Jade Emperor roams therein.\"\n\nIf we consider the domain over which the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy presides, the Four Assistants are the Left Assistant, Right Assistant, Front Counselor, and Rear Minister. The Five Elders are: the Elder of the Vast Ultimate of Jade Clarity, the Elder of the Numinous Radiance of the Empty Sovereign, the Elder of the Treasure Heaven of Mystic Florescence, the Elder of the Grand Numinosity of Luminous Subtlety, and the Elder of the Vast Capital of Sha Yu—these are the Five Elders. Taiyi is the Central Yellow Taiyi, and the Jade Emperor is the Most High Jade Emperor.",

      "translated_text": "The practice of bowing and rising is the proper decorum for transmitting scriptures. Within the Three Yuan Offices, the protocols for bowing and rising encompass two thousand four hundred rules. Since the Dragon Han era, these have sunk into chaos, their texts altered and incomplete. By the first year of the Red Clarity epoch, the Supreme Sages collated them, leaving only two hundred forty rules. Facing south in a long kneel is the method prescribed in the *Three Yuan Precepts and Prohibitions*. The south is the life-generating direction of the Left Office. Transmitting the Dao to disciples follows this principle of facing the source of life.\n\nThe Perfected One of Western Citadel states: \"Those who study the Dao must not act in haste; those who seek immortality must not rush precipitously.\" When one examines the transmission of the *Scripture of Generating the Spirit*, with its many stages and sequences, one understands why the Yellow Emperor traversed a full cycle, studied under over eighty masters, and received more than three thousand teachings—yet still did not behold the Mystery’s gate. Truly, there is reason for this.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy solemnly addressed the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings: \"These nine heavens’ chapters are the flying mystery-qi of the Three Caverns, formed into sound through three assemblies, coalescing into true script, blending the hundred spirits and concealing their inner names in hidden rhymes.\" Thus, the Great One tests and observes, gathering life from the ten directions, leading them to assemble in the Cavernous Void, and initiating oaths in cinnabar and azure. The Heavenly Worthy again addressed the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings: \"These nine heavens’ chapters are the flying mystery-qi of the Three Caverns, formed into sound through three assemblies, coalescing into true script, blending the hundred spirits and concealing their inner names in hidden rhymes.\" This indicates the profound secrecy of this scripture, as previously explained.\n\nThe reason for its secrecy is that the spirit of the Great One is always entrusted to test and observe in the human realm. If the test is passed, one must then initiate an oath before transmission may proceed. The matter of testing is carefully recorded in the *Essential and Wondrous Ready-Made Formulae*: \"In the past, when I received the divine scriptures, someone tested me by striking my hand with a staff until it bled. Yet I still turned my heart toward them, my thoughts untainted by other intentions—this was passing the test.\" The scriptural method includes a trial of commitment: before receiving the transmission, one’s clothes may be set aflame without cause, and though they burn away, one must not speak. Even so, no base or ugly qi should manifest outwardly, nor should any malicious words issue from the mouth—only then is the test passed.\n\nIn many versions, the character for \"test\" is mistakenly written as \"prohibition,\" obscuring the meaning. The *Scripture of the Golden Mystery Feathered Chapters* records the method of transmission: the Five Elders confer the charts, and the Great One tests and observes. Thus, one gathers life from the ten directions and leads them to assemble in the Cavern Heavens. The *Hidden Writ of Jade Clarity* also states: \"The Lord Emperor encompasses all heavens and tests the ten directions.\" This confirms that \"test\" was mistakenly written as \"prohibition.\"\n\nThe *Golden Mystery Feathered Chapters* further states: \"Gathering life from the ten directions and leading them to assemble in the Cavernous Void—what does this mean?\" Among the Six Caverns, the Cavernous Void corresponds to the west. Now, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy commands the Great One to gather life from the ten directions, a phrase that also encompasses the registers of the dead. Thus, it is said to lead them to assemble in the Cavernous Void, as the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings govern both life and death.\n\nInitiating oaths in cinnabar and azure involves smearing blood as cinnabar and silk as azure, both serving as tokens of sincerity and trust. For example, in the *Immortals’ Method of the Supreme Ultimate Azure Essence and Dry Stone Nourishment*, the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One, who received it from the Three Yuan Lord of Primordial Simplicity, still spoke of initiating oaths in golden azure. How much more so for the *Jade Chapters of Generating the Spirit*, which are the Primordial Beginning’s forbidden scriptures?\n\nWithout causes and conditions accumulated over countless kalpas, and without one’s name pre-recorded in the Emperor’s charts, one cannot even glimpse these texts. If one is deemed worthy to behold their contents, nine generations of ancestors ascend together as immortals. One must carefully select those destined for immortality, observe a thousand days of pure fasting over seven hundred years, present gold and silk, and swear an oath in accordance with the covenant before transmitting the scripture. If one is cautious, blessings will follow; if one leaks the teachings, calamity will arrive. Blessings extend to nine generations of ancestors, their virtue as weighty as mountains and seas. Calamity brings punishment that flows for countless kalpas, more agonizing than boiling poison, more excruciating than the wind’s blade—how can one not be cautious?\n\nThe retribution of causes and conditions is like the work of planting: if one cultivates carelessly, the harvest will be careless; if one sows haphazardly, the yield will be haphazard. Causes and conditions over countless kalpas are not accumulated in a single day, and thus the practitioner of the Dao does not achieve perfection in one lifetime. When Lord Xu ascended, the Emperor’s edict proclaimed: \"Since many kalpas ago, you have diligently cultivated the Supreme Dao, studying all methods and a thousand gates without fail.\" Thus, those whose names are recorded in the Emperor’s charts—how could it be otherwise?\n\nFor the practitioner of the Dao to behold the contents of these texts, there must be predestined affinity. As the *Inner Scripture of the Five Emperors* states: \"Those who attain the Dao but lack immortal bones will have their jade names inscribed in the books, yet in their next life, they will not behold these texts. Those who obtain the scriptures become the patriarchs of the Five Marchmounts.\" Here, it is said that beholding the texts allows nine generations of ancestors to ascend together as immortals—how does this differ from the former? However, the methods of the Great Cavern first resolve the karmic knots of the underworld, hence the reference to nine generations, which slightly differs from the *Inner Scripture of the Five Emperors*.\n\nThe *Jade Formulae of the Great Cavern Scripture* also states: \"Dissolving the hundred knots of seven generations of ancestors, they depart with the wind, roots severed, their foundations shifted, entering the Mystery through transformation.\" What cultivation could be greater than this? Thus, the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* and the *Chapters of Generating the Spirit* follow different paths to the same destination.\n\nPractitioners of the Dao, before their own merits are complete, must first eliminate their names from the ghostly registers. When transmitting the teachings, one must select those with immortal bones to receive them. Over seven hundred years, one observes a thousand days of pure fasting. This refers to the time limit for transmitting scriptures. For example, the Heavenly King of Primordial Beginning conferred the *Seventy-Four Methods Scripture* upon the Lord of Longevity and Controller of Destinies of the Southern Culmen, saying: \"After you fast for seven hundred years, you shall receive these three scriptures.\" The Heavenly Venerable of Primordial Beginning received the *Inner Scripture* from Master Hongya, opening it once every nine thousand years. Thus, seven and nine are yang numbers. One fasts with gold and silk, swears an oath in accordance with the covenant, and transmits the teachings.",

      "translated_text": "According to the *Three Primal Precepts of Retribution*: \"Offering wealth corresponds to the heart; extending the heart corresponds to wealth. Their merit is equal.\" The ancients sought the heart, while the degenerate age seeks wealth. The ancients transmitted nothing without the heart; the degenerate age delivers nothing without wealth.\n\n\"Gold and silk for the oath of the heart\": gold is chosen for its hardness and firmness, while silk substitutes for the cutting of hair. Throughout this scripture, warnings and covenants are reiterated. At the outset, it states: \"Whoever steals this shall suffer the Wind Blade for ten thousand kalpas, their soul perishing without rebirth.\" Later, it admonishes: \"Guard your heart and uphold this teaching; take care not to leak it lightly, lest the Wind Blade examine your body.\" Here, it declares: \"Be vigilant, and you shall enjoy blessings; leak it, and calamity shall arrive, even to the point of the Wind Blade’s punishment.\" How could one not be vigilant?\n\n*The Exegesis on the Jade Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Nine Heavens Generative Spirit*, Middle Scroll, concludes.\n\n---\n\n*The Exegesis on the Jade Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Nine Heavens Generative Spirit*, Lower Scroll\nCommentary by Wang Xichao, Recluse of the Hidden Worth, Daoist of Chongxu Abbey in Mianzhou\n\n**First Chapter: The Generative Spirit of the Boundless Heaven of Utmost Joy**\n\nThe nine heavens of this chapter differ from those in the *Central Record of Embryonic Essence*. From the Boundless Heaven of Utmost Joy to the seventh, the Heaven of Parinirmita-vaśavartin; the eighth, the Heaven of Brahmā-kāyika; and the ninth, the Heaven of Brahma-pāriṣadya—these nine heavens, when augmented by three additional heavens, form the twelve heavens of the Celestial Emperors, the ancestors of qi reception.\n\nIn the first month, one receives the qi of the Responsive Heaven of Primordial Transformation; in the second, the qi of the Heaven of Joyous Paranirmita; in the third, the qi of the Heaven of Silent Tuṣita; in the fourth, the qi of the Heaven of Brahmā-purohita; in the fifth, the qi of the Heaven of Infinite Life of Supreme Meditation; in the sixth, the qi of the Boundless Heaven of Utmost Joy; in the seventh, the qi of the Heaven of Numinous Transformation and Brahmā’s Assistants; in the eighth, the qi of the Heaven of Lofty Emptiness and Luminous Clarity; in the ninth, the qi of the Heaven of No-Thought, No-Knots, No-Attachment; in the tenth, the qi of the Heaven of Parinirmita-vaśavartin; in the eleventh, the qi of the Heaven of Brahmā-kāyika; and in the twelfth, the qi of the Heaven of Brahma-pāriṣadya.\n\nYet when cross-referenced with the nine heavens of the *Sutra of Divine Transformations*, their names bear no resemblance. If one discusses the reception of qi in humans, it must originate from the nine heavens. For instance, in the first month of gestation, one receives the qi of the Boundless Heaven of Utmost Joy—this is a fixed principle. If extended to twelve months, other interpretations may arise, but these are not adopted here.\n\n**The Imperial Perfected Embryonic Destiny: The Primordial Yellow-Evolved Qi of the One**\n\nWhen the Great Void gathers, there is qi; when qi gathers, there is essence. As qi gathers and essence coalesces, it is enveloped in earth, and the principle of incipient life is activated. As the scripture states: \"When male and female unite in essence, the embryonic womb begins to flourish.\" If yin envelops yang, a male is formed; if yang envelops yin, a female is formed. Riding the predestined fate of past lives, one is then born as a human—hence the term \"enveloped destiny.\"\n\nThe nine chapters of the *Primordial Beginning* each contain the four characters \"Imperial Perfected Destiny-Origin.\" The Imperial Perfected is the Primordial Sovereign of the Yellow Court, residing below the Gate of Destiny, governing the qi of generation. Thus, this chapter states: \"The Imperial Perfected first illuminates essence.\" As it governs without form, it is called \"Imperial\"; as it is the Supreme One without peer, it is called \"Perfected.\" The nine heavens are arrayed in proper order, all following the command of the Imperial Perfected. Therefore, each of the nine chapters must include the two characters \"Imperial Perfected\"—this is fixed and unchanging.\n\nWhen bestowed by heaven, it is like gold in the forge, like clay in the mold. Once the vessel is formed, square cannot become round, nor can crooked become straight. The teal’s legs are short, the crane’s legs are long—no iota can be added or subtracted.\n\nThe *Primordial* is the ancestor of qi’s initial generation. Its merit is profound, its craftsmanship wondrous; all things originate from it. \"Great indeed is the Creative, from which all things derive their beginning; perfect indeed is the Receptive, from which all things derive their birth.\" When the primordial qi first envelops, its form resembles a hanging sack, adhering to the spleen as its seed. The spleen is the true earth, upon which all things rely for generation. The Central Yellow Supreme One is the destiny of one’s own life—hence the term \"the primordial yellow-evolved qi of the One.\" *Evolved* is like the unfolding of the primordial net; all that lives cannot exist outside this.\n\n**Merging with the Hollow Void’s Qi, the Flying Spirits Drift in the Remote and Desolate.**\n**Extending Eons Without Term, Vast and Distant from the Root.**\n**Suffering Souls Sink Through Nine Nights, Awaiting Dawn to Yearn for the Sun’s Radiance.**\n\nWhen male and female unite in essence, the embryonic womb begins to flourish. That which has form is born from the formless—the formless is the hollow void’s qi. Heaven One generates water, which, together with earth, is enveloped in the self. The self is the true yang; true yang, from the self, embraces the north. Males revolve leftward for ten months and are born in the tiger (third earthly branch); females revolve rightward for ten months and are born in the monkey (ninth earthly branch). The monkey is the three yin; the tiger is the three yang. When the three yin and three yang are undivided, they are enveloped in the self—this is the time of merging.\n\nWater and earth evolve to fulfill their function—hence the term \"yellow-evolved.\" This is the true earth of the Great Clarity. Before qi is enveloped, it scatters in the realm of nothingness; before humans receive life, their souls and spirits drift in the remote and desolate. *Remote* signifies obscurity; *desolate* signifies distance. As the *Scripture of Lord Lao’s Exhortation to the Body* states: \"The Dharma Wheel turns in the remote and desolate; diligently practice the path to the distant shore.\"\n\nThose who grasp at life often linger from the eon of Extended Health to the present, passing through countless epochs—like a blind person walking south from Dark Mountain, growing ever more distant with each step, never to return to the source of life, thus \"vast and distant from the root.\" Inevitably, they follow suffering souls, sinking through the nine nights without beholding the light, sitting and awaiting dawn, striving to yearn for the radiance of the sun’s divine light. These six lines describe those who fail to receive life, drifting in delusion and transmigration, devoid of perception, awareness, or knowledge. They must endure hundreds of thousands of kalpas, their forms dissolving, their hearts withering—yet the benighted remain unaware.",

Thus, seven and nine are yang numbers. One fasts with gold and silk, swears an oath in accordance with the covenant, and transmits the teachings.",

first stirs in the Gate of Life, it is the primordial womb.\nHence it is said: \"The primordial womb binds long life.\"\nSince it is called \"long life,\" from this point life begins—\nHow could the six gradual stages be burdened by evil roots?\nThe *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states:\n\"The fetal sac of Jade Clarity, the embryo’s knot unfolds in radiance,\nSeven ancestors return to the womb, and my life attains long existence.\"\n\nOnly now is life received, necessarily relying on the qi-womb.\nOnce the knot is tied, the gradual formation of life begins.\n\nPeach-Kang unites essence to

\"Uniting Essence to Extend,\"\nGuarding below the human navel.\nIt is also called the revered spirit of the Great Cavern,\nRevolving wind to merge as the honored Unity.\nSome say Peach-Kang is the spirit of the Great One.\nThe Two Emperors refer to the Spirit Emperor and the Revered Emperor.\nThe *Hidden Book* states:\n\"Without the Great One, the Spirit Emperor’s emptiness does not revolve qi;\nWithout the Great One, the Revered Emperor’s Three Ones do not reside.\"\nThus the spirit of the Great One joins with the Five Spirits to serve the Two Emperors.\n\"Jade splendor\" speaks of purity.\nThe *Scripture of the Cavern* says:\n\"Amidst the forest of jade branches\"—\nThe intent is the same as the Gate of Life, though the learning differs.\nOnce the root-womb is initially formed, it becomes the Gate of Life,\nHence the Gate of Life is also called the \"root-womb.\"\nFrom this, the principle of life’s ceaseless generation arises.\nWithin the twelve hours, the spirit of the Great One circulates the qi of life,\nIrrigating and refining essence, preventing it from withering and decay.\nThe *Yellow Court* states:\n\"Irrigate and nourish the numinous root so it never withers,\nSeal the Gate of Life and treasure its jade.\"\n\nThe Nine Heavens command the Numinous Chapter,\nAnd the spirit of life transcends itself.\nThe Primal Lord bars the gates of death,\nWhile

this flourishing of the old sprout.\n\nThese eight lines, in ancient interpretation, refer to the hymn of the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings—\nYet whether this is truly so remains uncertain.\nSince the scripture’s text does not record it, it cannot be affirmed.\nIf this is indeed the hymn of the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings,\nIt should form a separate chapter, as with the two recitations of the Perfected of the Great Ultimate later.\nIf it is the hymn of the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings,\nThe tonal rhythm should not flow as if from a single hand.\nThe coherence of the text suggests it is not two chapters merged into one—\nThose with discernment will grasp this themselves.\n\nAfter essence is refined and does not wither, the principle of ceaseless generation arises.\nThus the Nine Heavens send down the Numinous Chapter to blend the hundred spirits.\nHence it is said: \"The Nine Decisions command the Numinous Chapter, and the spirit of life transcends itself.\"\nOnce the spirit is born, it is no longer the spirit born of the womb—\nIt is the natural chapter.\nIf I cultivate life, I merge with the spirit;\nIf I do not cultivate life, we remain distinct.\nThe so-called \"spirit\" is the unfathomable of yin and yang—\nHow could it follow human birth and death?\n\"Transcends itself\" means birth and death cannot constrain it.\n\nWithin the body are thirty-nine gates of life and thirty-nine gates of death.\nSince humans depend on life, they fear the gates of death may reopen—\nThus the Primal Lord is commanded to bar them, preventing the gates of death from opening and qi from invading.\nThe *Yellow Court* states:\n\"One must attain true perfection to gaze upon them,\nMost detestable are the dead qi and all impurities.\"\n\nThe Marshal is the Longevity Marshal.\nThe scripture says: \"The Nine Heavens recite this to give life to humans.\"\nWhen a person is to be born, this chapter must be sung,\nCausing qi to congeal and form to take shape.\nThe Marshal chants,

myriad heavens descend in attendance,\nTheir joy and celebration beyond words.\nBowing in reverence, they meet an encounter of ten thousand kalpas—\nFor their ethereal souls,\nSince the era of Extended Health, have been severed by time,\nUnable to receive life.\nNow that life is received, it is like the world’s rice seedlings,\nWhich inherently possess the will to grow—\nWithout entering the soil, their stems and sprouts would not flourish.\nWhen farmers see this, how could they not rejoice?\nThus they bow in reverence through kalpas of ages,\nCelebrating this flourishing of the old sprout.\n\nHence Mo Xi Zi said:\n\"To study the Dao and perfect the true lies in this life;\nThe deluded wait for death before seeking life.\nThis life cannot lack the principle of life—\nEven if life

life for the entire body\noriginates from its own root,\nbeginning here.\nThus it is called the *\"Primordial Cavern of Fetal Life.\"*\nThough all nine chapters mention *\"life,\"*\nthis *\"life\"* differs from the rest.\n\nThe kidneys and the Gate of Life unite as one.\nAmong the five viscera,\nthe kidneys are uniquely called a *\"pair,\"*\nfor they encompass the gateways of both Yin and Yang, life and death.\nThe Gate of Life is also named the *\"Sea of Qi\"*—\nwhen the text speaks of *\"honored qi,\"* it refers to this.\nIts qi ascends to congeal at the Purple Gate,\nyet one does not perceive its origin in the Gate of Life.\nThis qi is the king of the entire body.\nThe five viscera and six bowels,\nthe hundred joints and hundred vessels,\nthe golden fluids and jade essences,\nthe radiance of sun and moon—\nall stem from the kidneys.\nThus the *Huangting Jing* states:\n*\"It governs the six bowels and the nine fluids’ source.\"*\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The true person’s breath reaches the heels.\"*\nMany commentators take *\"heels\"* to mean the feet,\nbut if breath reached the feet, it would be so—\nwhat is called *\"heels\"* is the Gate of Life.\nIts qi breathes in the Gate of Life,\nlike a child in the womb,\nneither drinking nor eating,\nyet enduring ceaselessly—\nthis is called *\"fetal breathing.\"*\nQi fundamentally arises from the kidneys;\nif it breathed elsewhere, such a principle could not exist.\n\nThe qi in the kidneys is like a ruler in a kingdom.\nThe *\"radiance of the Primordial Cavern and Purple Gate in the nine heavens\"*\nis analogous to the qi in the kidneys—\nthe head is like the king of heaven.\nWhen it resides in the empty vastness,\nthe wheel of transformation turns,\ncirculating without cease.\nThat which is born is born of itself;\nthat which transforms transforms of itself.\nIf there are ethereal souls seeking life,\nthough they shed their old roots\nand depart from past attachments—\nthose old roots are the qi of death.\n\nMost people cling to love and attachment,\ntrapped in endless cycles of birth and death.\nIf one does not first relinquish attachment,\nthe perception of realms remains,\nand one errs into the shoots of various destinies,\nbecoming entangled.\nThis is the *\"second echo\"* of the recitation:\nthe dissolution of fetal congealment and the severing of roots.\nIt speaks of *\"departing from past attachments\"*\nand yet *\"longing for the ancestral source,\"*\nfor human life and death are not matters of a single day.\nReflecting on past lives and deaths,\nall arise from attachment.\nWithout grasping the root, there is no Dao.\nIf one now receives life through the Dao,\nuniting with the ancestral source as one,\npreserving form and exhausting life,\nestablishing virtue and illuminating the Dao,\nsharing radiance with sun and moon,\nand enduring with heaven and earth—\nwhile all others perish, I alone endure,\nonly then is the ultimate realm attained.\n\nClinging to past attachments,\none sinks into the long night,\nkalpas passing in succession,\nunable to find rebirth,\nsuffering and repaying each debt in full.\nNow, as the turning point arrives,\nat the dawn of the great cycle’s renewal,\nthe Primordial Heavenly Worthy opens the era of *\"Great Possession,\"*\nallowing those with aspiration to hear the Dharma’s sound\namidst the reckoning of destinies—\nis this not fortune?\n\nThe Imperial Perfected’s first luminous essence\nis named *\"Self-Originating Yang.\"*\nThe infant, Shi Bohua,\ncongeals the fetus and guards the Yellow Chamber.\nSever the roots and cut off the gate of death,\nnurture harmony and nourish the infant.\nAbove, the Crimson Child;\nin the center, the Primordial Sovereign;\nbelow, the Primordial King—\nthese are the Three Ones.\nThe Primordial King is the spirit of the Gate of Life.\nHis name is *\"First Luminous Essence,\"*\nhis style *\"Primordial Yang,\"*\nalso called *\"Infant Fetus\"* and *\"Bo Shi Yuan.\"*\nThese three phrases all denote the spirit’s names and styles.\n\nAccording to the *Neizhu Pian* of the *Immortal Scriptures*:\n*\"This is the Great One of the Lower Palace.\"*\nThe *Tai Su Yu Lu* states:\n*\"The Great One is the essence of the embryo,\nthe master of transformation,\nthus able to congeal the fetus and form the body\nwithin the Yellow Court.\"*\nThe Yellow Chamber is the Yellow Court.\n\nFor humans, birth is difficult and death easy.\nHaving received life,\none’s qi is subtle and weak,\nwhile Yin evil constantly prevails.\nThe *Scripture of Salvation* says:\n*\"In the Northern Capital’s Winding Springs Palace,\nthere are ten thousand ghosts in throngs,\nall seeking to obstruct human destiny\nand sever the Gate of Life.\"*\nYin ghosts always desire human death,\nlurking in darkness to demand sacrifices.\nOnce a person dies,\nthe hun-soul wanders in the great void,\nseeking offerings—\nthis is the corpse-ghost.\nSuch ghosts mimic human form and speech,\nbut they are not the hun-soul.\nThus the ghostly realm values endings.\nWithout a presiding spirit,\none cannot sever the gate of death’s roots.\nHaving cut them off,\none must nurture harmony to foster life—\nhence *\"nurture harmony and nourish the infant.\"*\n*\"Harmony\"* means peace.\n\nThe infant is the spirit of the lower cinnabar field.\nThe *Huangting Jing* states:\n*\"In the leisurely realm, nurture the true and cultivate flourishing glory.\"*\nThe meditative goodness guides the numinous qi,\nthe mysterious nourishment feeds the flying celestial fragrance.\nThe radiant splendor refines the jade-like essence,\nforging a form of its own.\nStrive for the mysterious and cultivate life,\narraying all in the Hall of Light.\n\nHaving attained nurturance,\nnothing fails to grow.\n*\"Nurturance\"* here does not mean nourishment by things,\nbut by qi.\nThus above it speaks of *\"nourishing the infant,\"*\nand below of *\"meditative goodness guiding the numinous qi,\nthe mysterious nourishment feeding celestial fragrance\"*—\nthese are the means of nurturance.\nOnce the fetus is formed,\nYang generates and Yin nourishes.\nIn this second chapter,\nthe Emperor of the Highest Meditation Heaven\nguides with numinous qi\nand feeds with celestial fragrance—\nthis is the qi of great harmony.\nThus the *Huangting Jing* says:\n*\"Thirst has its own nectar, hunger finds satiety,\"*\nwhich expresses this principle.\n*\"Radiant splendor\"* refers to the brilliance of sun and moon.",

      "translated_text": "Thus the *Scripture of the Seven Perfected of Golden Radiance* states: \"If one can fathom the radiant splendor of golden light and the jade-like effulgence in flowing brilliance, one will journey with the Great Obscurity into the midst of the Supreme Void.\" This is the method of exploring the luminosity of sun and moon. According to the *Numinous Writ of the Golden Portals of Highest Clarity*, ingesting solar radiance disperses the knots of death and preserves the congealed mud-pellet [of the brain]. Thus we know that radiant splendor is not merely ingested to nurture the fetus, but also to unbind the knots of the death-gate. The Perfected of the Nine Heavens regard this as the method of ingesting sun and moon. Practicing it over time, the body daily generates luster, the face shines with jade-like light—hence it is said: \"Radiant splendor, jade-like essence, refined through essence to form one’s countenance.\" To cultivate the mysterious and esteem life.\n\nWithin the fetus dwell two spirits. The first is the Lord of White Qi, named \"Cultivator of the Mysterious,\" styled \"Esteemer of Life\"; the second is \"Returner to the Mysterious,\" styled \"Abundant Covering.\" These two spirits together guard above the five viscera. Once the fetal destiny is complete, their spirits are born.\n\nRegarding the Hall of Light, there are two interpretations. In the second month, when the fetus forms, the body is not yet complete—how could it array itself within the Hall of Light? Earlier masters often took the nine palaces as the Hall of Light, yet when the nine palaces are apportioned, the fetus has only begun to take shape, its sense organs not yet formed—this cannot be the Hall of Light in question. The Hall of Light here refers to the Hall of Light of the lungs. Only with the Gate of Destiny does the heart arise; the heart governs blood, modeled on *ding* giving rise to *bing*. Only with the heart do the lungs arise; the lungs govern qi, modeled on *xin* giving rise to *geng*. Thus heart and kidneys divide Yin and Yang, and through mutual restraint, the lungs are generated. We thus know that once the qi of the Cavernous Obscurity’s Purple Gate forms the fetal shape, the lungs arise next, and their spirits array themselves within the Hall of Light of the lungs. For only through mutual restraint is the principle of mutual generation revealed. If the sequence of initial generation were inverted and applied in reverse, the marvel of life’s transformations might well cease.\n\nThe Great Void stirs numinous convergence,\ncommanding me to sing the \"Chapter on Generating Spirit.\"\nAt the first chant, the Nine Mysteries stir;\nat the second recitation, Heaven and Earth commune.\nHarmonizing of itself, they blend;\nnine repetitions complete the work of humanity.\nThe Great Sage rejoices in primordial auspiciousness,\nscattering flowers in homage to the Great Void.\nAll heavens delight in unison,\nall beings bow in reverence.\n\nThe Great Void is the utmost of emptiness. When emptiness reaches its extreme, spirit arises of itself. \"Numinous convergence\" is the name-taboo of the Five Numinous Lords. The scripture states: \"The Controller of Destiny fixes the reckoning; the Five Thearchs oversee life.\" At the time of birth, the Five Elders descend to command the \"Chapter on Generating Spirit\" to send down true qi and gather the myriad spirits—hence it is said: \"The Great Void stirs numinous convergence, commanding me to sing the 'Chapter on Generating Spirit.'\" \"At the first chant, the Nine Mysteries stir\"—reciting it once, the sound reaches the Nine Heavens. \"At the second recitation, Heaven and Earth commune\"—reciting it twice, Heaven and Earth establish reverence. \"Harmonizing of itself, they blend; nine repetitions complete the work of humanity.\" When Heaven and Earth commune, the two interpenetrate to form harmony, and the myriad things are born. When the myriad things are born, the Three Powers are complete, and the Dao of humanity is established—hence it is said to \"complete the work of humanity.\" The \"nine repetitions\" signify that when qi is replete and spirit complete, a person is born. At the time of birth, the Great Sages of all heavens rejoice in its primordial auspiciousness. \"Primordial\" is the chief of virtues; \"auspicious\" means nothing is not favorable. Thus the immortal Dao is ever auspicious, while the ghostly Dao is ever inauspicious. Now that one has become human, the ghostly Dao no longer blocks the gate of life or severs the Gate of Destiny. The joy of auspiciousness cannot be described—scattering flowers in homage, one dances with hands and leaps with feet without awareness. The Highest Perfected of all heavens universally rejoice, bowing their heads in reverence for the Dao of rebirth.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Heavenly Watcher of the Brahmā Realm* states:\n**\"Chapter Three: The Chapter on Generating Spirit\"**\n*The Qi of the Emperor Perfected, the Luminous Immortal of the Long-Lived Spirit-Soul*\nThe Watcher of Brahmā extends the Three Numinous Ones,\nthe qi of Primordial Mystery and Origin divides.\nVastly the Great Brahmā spreads,\nradiant splendor, emerald jade honor.\n\nThe soul is completed in Heaven; once the soul is complete, the root of the entire body is established. Heaven takes the Three Luminaries as its root; humanity takes the Three Hun-Souls as its root. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: \"The Three Luminaries of Illuminating Clarity are the root of Heaven.\" The Five Scripts open and expand, universally planting the numinous spirits. By \"universally planting the numinous spirits,\" the myriad transformations arise therefrom, and their vastness and completeness may be known. Once the qi of the human soul gathers, the Five Agents and hundred spirits all assemble—thus it concludes with the \"Three Sections and Eight Luminaries,\" the principle of which is evident.\n\nTo speak of Heaven is necessarily to take the body as its foundation; to speak of humanity is necessarily to take Heaven as its wholeness. *Zhuangzi* states: \"Heaven and Earth are born together with me; the myriad things and I are one.\" For Heaven and humanity have never been separate.\n\nThe qi of the Watcher of Brahmā is the primordial qi of Heaven. Primordial qi is the ancestor of the Great Brahmā; the primordial net unfolds, nothing is untouched. The Three Qi of Mystery, Origin, and Beginning divide therefrom, and the Nine Heavens are born thereby—hence it is said: \"The Watcher of Brahmā extends the Three Numinous Ones; the qi of Primordial Mystery and Origin divides.\" The \"Three Numinous Ones,\" according to the *Scripture of Nurturing Spirit in the Yellow Court*, are the spirits within the heart, whose names are three: the Numinous Lord of Vermilion, the Numinous Lord of Brightness, and the Numinous Lord of Yellow. When the Three Numinous Ones gather, the root of the entire body is established. Just as the qi of the Great Brahmā pervades boundlessly, the heavens are differentiated, each generating its luminous realm—necessarily taking the Jade Capital Mountain as the meeting place of the Three Heavens, with the Primordial Beginning as the most honored of the myriad heavens. Hence it is said: \"Vastly the Great Brahmā spreads, radiant capital, emerald jade honor.\" \"Vast\" describes its boundlessness; \"radiant capital\" refers to the Jade Capital. \"Jade honor\" means the Jade Thearch is the most honored. Discussing it in terms of the body, within the mud-pellet [of the brain] is the palace of the Jade Thearch—truly the Heavenly Treasure Lord.\n\nThe luminous Brahmā flies with the mysterious radiance,\nopening and delivering the souls of the long night.\nThe ethereal spirits hasten to their appointed return,\nqi upon qi returning to their original root.\n\nCarefully considering these four lines: the qi of Brahmā establishes Heaven and Earth. When a person receives life, it must originate from the qi of Brahmā. Within it is the spirit that receives life, named the \"Luminous Brahmā.\"",

      "translated_text": "The *Rescue from Suffering Universal Incantation* speaks of the six qi flowing freely, with the Luminous Brahmā unfolding its summoning—this is the reference. The \"mysterious radiance\" is the dragon one rides. According to the *Sutra of Empty Constancy and Transformation*: \"The rustling mysterious radiance ascends on the subtle breeze’s wings beneath the Great Yang.\" The *Scripture of the Golden Clarity Seven Perfected* states: \"Those who cultivate the true should visualize the Primordial Beginning in the Jade Thearch, the Empty Mystery and the Great Light, ascending the mysterious radiance to inquire of the Nine August Ones.\" The *Method of the South Pole Primordial Lord for Visualizing the Five Stars* says: \"Constantly visualize the five stars, and after fifteen years, the Five Elders will each welcome you with the objects they summon. Only the North Pole Elder, the Mysterious Supreme Immortal Thearch, welcomes with the dragon of mysterious radiance.\" Thus, Chapter Eight states: \"The mysterious radiance illuminates the cloud thoroughfare, its traces transcending the divine beyond.\" The *Scripture of the Dao-Treasure* says: \"The mysterious radiance’s green chariot with its mottled carriage—all are the vehicles of the celestial perfected.\" From this, we know that at the beginning of a person’s life, the spirit of the Luminous Brahmā drives the dragon-chariot through the Great Void, delivering the souls of the long night and guiding the wandering spirits to their place of birth. After a person’s death, the soul-spirit drifts in the Great Void, like one traveling far from home, long absent from their native land. Relying on this life-spirit, each returns to its origin. In the first month, the embryo forms; in the second, the fetus; in the third, the soul. Once the three souls are established, the roots are deep and the stem firm, qi upon qi returning to their origin—thus the body may be formed.\n\nThe Great Thearch is titled \"Yang Hall,\" styled \"Eightfold Spirit Lord.\" The Ninefold Opening turns the Dao of fortune, and the fetal qi generates the Upper Prime. The Numinous Brahmā delivers the register of life; the Great One assists the essence in its extension. The Mud-Pellet spreads the Thearch’s seat, and the Three Sections and Eight Radiances divide. The soul arises, gathering the wandering qi; through nine revolutions, one naturally attains immortality.\n\nOnce the soul is complete and qi upon qi returns to its root, one may align the seven spirits within the body. The Great Thearch is the essence-soul, named \"Yang Hall King,\" styled \"Eightfold Spirit.\" The seven spirits are the Mysterious Father, Mysterious Mother, Thearch Sovereign, Nine Thearchs, Great Thearch, Heavenly Thearch, and Record Thearch—seven in all. The Ninefold Opening is the Heavenly Thearch’s soul, named \"Record of the Turning Dao,\" styled \"Record of the River’s Name.\" The Shu version of the scripture writes \"Nine Passes,\" named \"Record of the Turning Dao.\" Only the *Scripture of Generating the Spirit* writes \"Turning Fortune Dao.\" It is unclear whether \"Turning Fortune Dao\" or \"Record of the Turning Dao\" is correct. Only the \"Ninefold Opening\" two characters are confirmed by the *Method of Lord Pei’s Conduct*, which states: \"The assembled perfected gather at the Terrace of the Great Subtlety, opening the gates of the Nine Heavens above.\" The annotation says: \"Paying homage to the Grand Simplicity, the prayer reads: 'Heavenly Pass of the Ninefold Opening.'\" If \"pass\" is taken for \"opening,\" then \"Turning Fortune Dao\" might still be plausible, though it should not have the character \"record\" inverted to \"fortune.\" Further correction by the learned is awaited. Moreover, during the Lin’an period, a commentary on the *Scripture of Generating the Spirit* explained \"Turning Fortune Dao\" as the name of a fire spirit—an even greater error. Thus, we know that scriptural commentaries err differently than chapter annotations. Scholars must devote their utmost care.\n\n\"The fetal qi generates the Upper Prime.\" According to the *Jade Record of the Grand Simplicity*: \"The soul and spirit arise from the fetal form; in the third month, the soul forms, its qi originally born from the fetus.\" The Great Harmony August One, the Elder Lord, governs the qi of the fetal origin, emerging from the Purple Tenuity—precisely within the Kunlun, the abode of the Great One. Kunlun is the Palace of the Upper Prime. This means the soul receives life beginning from the fetal qi, its position in the Palace of the Upper Prime. The Numinous Brahmā is the name of the Great One Thearch Lord, also called the Divine Elder, guarding the space between a person’s brows—this is the Purple Chamber’s inner palace. Thus, the *Yellow Simplicity Scripture of the Forty-Four Directions* prays: \"The Numinous Brahmā treads prosperity, the Ninefold Spirit Elder, the Great One’s diligent attendant, the Five Spirits’ Yellow Tranquility.\" The character \"陵\" is often mistakenly written as \"凌.\" It governs a person’s lifespan, so the *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir* says: \"The Elder Who Controls Life presides over the origin of one’s life-year, holding the records of longevity and early death. Thus, the spirit who oversees life determines the length of one’s allotted years.\" \"Assists the essence in its extension\" means aiding the spirit of the Gate of Life, where \"extension\" is the character for \"peach and well-being.\" The Mud-Pellet is the upper cinnabar field, the Heavenly Thearch’s dwelling—thus, \"the Mud-Pellet spreads the Thearch’s seat.\" The Mud-Pellet contains nine palaces, all places where the Thearch Lords enter, rest, and reside. Once the Thearch’s seat is spread, the Three Sections and Eight Radiances naturally divide. The *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir* says: \"Humans receive life from Heaven; the soul coalesces from the Primordial Spirit. The revolving nine qi give rise to life through the merit of the Great One Heavenly August. Nine transformations become spirit, and merit completes the human form. Body and spirit unite. When qi follows the soul’s birth, it daily circulates the mother-child qi, transforming with the spirit alongside the form—this is the Dao of immortality. How could it be otherwise? Those who act thus undergo nine revolutions and naturally become immortals. If one ceases effort, so too does this.\"\n\nThe resonant sound of the Nine Heavens rings clear, and the jade scripture gives birth to the ten thousand spirits. Thrice recited, they array in their proper positions; the qi joins the gates of the eight celestial paths. The Mysterious Pass blocks the Gate of Death; the numinous guards the source of fluids. Responding to the meeting, it senses the numinous number; the luminous Dao subtly revolves the wheel. Celebrating this infant’s shedding, we bow our heads to praise the cavern scripture.\n\n\"Resonant\" describes the sound’s clarity and stirring power. The spirit can dwell in qi, and qi can retain the spirit. The jade scripture of generating the spirit is the coagulation of qi; when qi coagulates, it forms spirit, and the ten thousand spirits thus arise. That which occupies the upper position is pure qi; that which occupies the lower is turbid qi; that which occupies the middle is harmonious qi. Threefold reverence to the spirit, refining the soul-gate for immortality—this is the thrice-recited array in proper position. \"The qi joins the gates of the eight celestial paths.\" The eight paths of Heaven can bring fortune or misfortune. Those who know their Dao are unfathomable to ghosts and spirits, riding dragons through the void, their spirit wandering boundlessly. The *Chart of Authority and Dao* says: \"The Rest Door connects to the Crimson Palace of Heaven; the Life Door connects to the Hall of Brightness of Heaven; the Birth Door connects to the Jade Hall of Heaven.\"",

      "translated_text": "These three gates, when opened, bring fortune, residing above the Three Heavens. There is also the Death Gate, which connects to the qi of death; the Blocked Gate enters the Door of Death; the Wound Gate and the Fright Gate are the paths where the two qi divide. The Capital Gate lies where yang qi utterly perishes. These eight gates of the celestial paths bear both fortune and misfortune—misfortune is the Door of Death.\n\nThe Purple Void Dao Lord states in the *Upper Scripture of the Grotto Chamber*: \"Ascend the Purple Gate, gaze upon the eight celestial paths, guide the Cinnabar Palace, and assemble the luminous spirits.\" The Mysterious Pass is the lower Cinnabar Field. The *Declarations of the Perfected* says: \"Guard and seal the Primordial Pass, inwardly preserve the Nine Perfected; the threefold qi circulates the fluids, irrigating the Cinnabar Field.\" The Gate of Destiny lies three inches below the navel—this is the Gate of Life. When the Gate of Life opens, the Door of Death closes. Thus it is said: the Mysterious Pass obstructs the Door of Death, the numinous guards the source of fluids. \"Numinous\" refers to spirit. When spirit securely abides in the lower field, fluids flow unimpeded, and hunger and thirst no longer arise. As the *Yellow Court* states: \"Above, it harmonizes with the Triple Burner; below, it descends as jade nectar. Mysterious fluids course like clouds, dispelling foulness and fragrance, governing and refining the five directions. Draw the fluids to the Mysterious Throat and enter the Hall of Brightness.\"\n\nAt this very moment, when spirit responds and qi is complete, it is the time when the flying immortals and divine beings initiate transformation. The radiant Dao spreads widely; dark souls hear of it and attain liberation, no longer subject to the wheel of rebirth. Then qi coagulates into essence, essence resonates into spirit, spirit transforms into the infant, and the infant is the True Unity of the lower Cinnabar Field. Having attained the transformed body of the infant, one may, following the methods of the *Great Grotto*, soar through the Three Realms. Thus it is said: \"Responding to the convergence of numinous numbers, the radiant Dao secretly reverses the wheel. Celebrating this infant’s transformation, we bow in homage to the *Grotto Scripture*.\"\n\n**Chapter Four of the \"Silent Convergence\" from the *Celestial Liturgy of Life and Spirit*: The Imperial Perfected, the Po-Soul’s Destiny, and the Qi of Yuan-Yang’s Evolution from the Dark Corpse**\n\nAt the beginning of human transformation, it is called the *po*-soul. While the *hun*-soul abides, the *po* follows it; when the *hun* departs, the *po* has no support—hence it is called a corpse. The *hun*-qi governs ascent, while the *po*-body governs descent. Thus the Perfected of Impassive Void states: \"It belongs to the heavy and turbid, and thus it gathers.\" The heavy and turbid are of the *po*’s kind. When gathered, it becomes as solid as an object—hence it is called the \"corpse of evolution.\"\n\nAfter three months in the womb, the *hun* is formed; when the *hun* is complete, the *po* is also born. There is nothing that does not arise from qi, converging without constraint—hence it is called \"dark.\" \"Dark\" means union. From whence does qi come? It is the qi of the Primordial Unity’s Yellow Evolution, as the *Zhuangzi* states: \"The qi of the entire world is one.\"\n\nSilent, formless, it upholds the ancestral lineage;\nThe *Doushu* Heaven resists the Great Veil.\nNuminous transformations divide the Four Sceneries,\nMyriad strands of emerald and vermilion clouds.\n\nThe Primordial Qi generates the *Yudan* Heaven, the *Shanyi* Heaven, the *Xuyan* Heaven; the Yuan Qi generates the *Douyan* Heaven, the *Bujiaole* Heaven, and the *Huayingsheng* Heaven. Only the *Jiran Doushu* Heaven lies below the Great Veil Heaven and above the Four Heavens of the Formless Realm—hence it is said: \"Silent, formless, it upholds the ancestral lineage; the *Doushu* resists the Great Veil.\" The character *kang* (抗) is pronounced *hang* (航), meaning \"to carry,\" for it bears the weight like a boat. The *Doushu* Heaven lies below the Great Veil, thus functioning like a vessel carrying things. If interpreted as *kang* (resisting), it would imply opposition to the Great Veil, which is illogical and harms the meaning.\n\nAfter the Yuan Qi transforms and generates the *Doushu* Heaven, it further generates the Four Heavens of the Formless Realm—this is what is meant by \"numinous transformations divide the Four Sceneries.\" The *Scripture on Subduing Demons* states: \"The Great Sun harmonizes with the morning audience; numinous transformations divide the Four Canopies.\" The Four Sceneries are also called \"chariots.\" In ancient times, the Most High Dao Lord rode the chariot of the Four Sceneries. \"Myriad strands of emerald and vermilion clouds\" refers to the generation of the Formless Realm, where each heaven possesses its own sun, moon, clouds, and auroras. The people of these heavens constantly gather and consume the essence of the sun and moon, along with vermilion clouds. As the *Red Writ Jade Formula* states in its cloud-feeding incantation: \"Within lies plain yellow, the home of the Primordial Beginning. Three white dragons harness the sevenfold majestic qi, lingering at the Jade Gate, dispersing the essence of vermilion clouds.\" The Lady of the Southern Marchmount says: \"Clouds are the essence of the sun.\" The method of consuming clouds is most secret; the way to summon clouds remains unseen. This refers to the practice of embodying jade radiance and auroras, reflecting the methods of the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe wandering soul does not turn back;\nOnce departed, it vanquishes the hordes of demons.\nThe Divine Duke captures the wandering qi,\nDrifting and refining the pure essence.\n\nThe *po* forms in the earth—it is yin—and delights in death. The methods of the *Great Grotto* include techniques to restrain the *po*, preventing its dissipation. When one dreams of battling others, it is the work of corpse-demons—corpse-demons are the *po*. If a person dies, their *po* departs forever, pursuing the six grottoes of demonic hordes, for it delights in finding companions. However, the Emperor of *Doushu* Heaven presides over the salvation of living beings in the world. Once one attains human form, the *po* is completed in the fourth month. If the wandering *po* does not return, it must rely on the Divine Duke to capture it. The Divine Duke is the Prime Minister of the Jade Clarity Heaven. When he was once tasked with subduing the Northern Feng, the Jade Clarity’s Prime Minister was appointed as the commander of the punitive expedition. Since his role involved leading the army, he was titled the Divine Duke. In terms of the body, this refers to the lung, called the \"Divine Achievement.\" The *po* makes its home in the lung, which also governs qi, and its color is white. If the wandering *po* returns, one must refine its qi to generate essence. Thus the *Yellow Court* states: \"Hasten to preserve the White Prime and harmonize the six qi; immortals endure long without calamity.\"\n\nFlourishing and splendid, it anchors the kalpa’s term,\nRiding the turning of fate, responding to the numinous chart.\nThe *Grotto Scripture of Life and Spirit* arises,\nJade tones soar beyond the ninefold clouds.\nOne chant summons the assembly of the ten thousand Perfected,\nAscending in splendor, they unite as one family.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven values life, and life’s root is qi. When qi resides within the body, the body attains longevity. Thus the immortals say: \"Spirit commands qi, qi preserves form; without relying on external aids, one naturally attains long life.\" When the body achieves longevity, it equals the great kalpa’s span, flourishing and unwithering. Riding this turning of fate, one may inscribe their name in the Mysterious Union.",

      "translated_text": "In his letter to Lady Yunlin, Xu Mu writes: \"Fortunate to encounter the mysterious turning, the numinous awakens its convergence.\" Thus it is said: \"Flourishing and splendid, it anchors the kalpa’s term, riding the turning of fate, responding to the numinous chart.\" Without the *Grotto Scripture of Life and Spirit*, this Dao would not be easily attained. Hence it is said: \"The *Grotto Scripture of Life and Spirit* arises, jade tones soar beyond the ninefold clouds. One chant summons the assembly of the ten thousand Perfected, ascending in splendor, they unite as one family.\" The \"jade tones\" refer to the *Scripture of Life and Spirit*, resonant as jade’s melody. The *True Transmission of the Three Caverns* states: \"The Perfected draws in the radiance of the five directions’ primordial dawn and consumes the essence of the ninefold clouds.\" Nine is the yang number, hence \"ninefold clouds.\" As the *Scripture of Golden Perfection* says: \"Ascending through the ninefold clouds, soaring in the Upper Clarity, in a single chant, the ten thousand Perfected assemble—unbidden, yet thus it is.\" \"Ascending in splendor, they unite as one family\": *shuang* denotes the hun-soul. The po-soul returns to the hun-soul as its home. When hun and po unite, there can be no separation. This is the unity from which life is formed. Without yin, yang cannot arise; without yang, yin cannot be completed—the Dao of yin and yang is truly vast!\n\nNine transformations complete the numinous radiance,\nLush and resplendent, they illumine the jade blossom.\nThe arts of Dou open the great abundance,\nOne celebration bestows boundless blessings.\nThe Supreme Sage turns the imperial chariot,\nThe Divine Child and Elder Brother suddenly sing.\nOverwhelmed by the auspicious assembly,\nAll bow their heads in harmony.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Supreme Perfection* states: \"Formless in primordial chaos, it transforms nine times in a single day; only after nine transformations does it gain function.\" The *Scripture of Life and Spirit* is the ancestor of qi. When a person is conceived, only when the nine qi are complete can a human form be achieved. If even one qi is lacking, it leads to premature death or deficiency. Each chapter must be recited nine times to fulfill the work of human formation, nine times to ascend and pay homage to the heavens, nine transformations to attain immortality—thus reaching this chapter. It also says: \"Nine transformations complete the numinous radiance.\" Once the po-soul exists, it must await the ninth month, when qi is full and spirit complete, before birth can occur. *Ling* denotes spirit. The *Golden Root Scripture of the Purple Book* states: \"Returning the wind’s chaotic union, congealing nine transformations in the mysterious essence.\" After nine transformations, the lung-qi is sufficient. *Yuyu* describes abundance; *yao* signifies its radiance, and the \"jade blossom\" is the lung. The Heavenly Emperor of Dou is the master of the lung-po, delighting in liberation. When the great abundance is resolved above, if one can give life to the heavens and descend as a Supreme Sage, they ascend in their chariot and assemble. Then the Divine Child commands the divine infants to sing the boundless hymn, and the living instantly attain the chamber of the three refinements. All the heavenly beings, overjoyed, fortunate to encounter this auspicious moment—when the sound ascends and the spirits of the nine heavens rejoice—bow their heads in unison. Thus it is said: \"The arts of Dou open the great abundance, one celebration bestows boundless blessings. The Supreme Sage turns the imperial chariot, the Divine Child and Elder Brother suddenly sing. Overwhelmed by the auspicious assembly, all bow their heads in harmony.\"\n\n**Fifth Chapter: The Joyous Heaven of Pāramitā’s *Scripture of Life and Spirit***\n*The Qi of the Five Immortals within the Emperor’s True Storehouse of the Viscera and Life-Origin*\n\nFluttering, the Five Emperors’ chariots,\nDrifting, they arrive at the Gate of the Mysterious Above.\nStrolling through the Yellow Flower Wilderness,\nReturning the spirit to the joyous end.\nGathering the flying ethereal souls,\nOld *shuang* are mostly lost.\n\nHeaven One resides in the storehouse to initiate beginnings,\nHeaven Five resides in the viscera to complete endings.\nThe qi of metal, wood, water, and fire cannot form without earth;\nThe origins of heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys cannot be nourished without the spleen.\nThe qi of the nine heavens first descends as the embryo, called the \"primordial yellow qi of Yuan Yi.\"\nBy the fifth month, the five viscera are differentiated, also named the \"central numinous qi.\"\nThus, it is known that the one who initiates and completes is none other than earth.\nHence it is said: \"Fluttering, the Five Emperors’ chariots.\" The Five Emperors have been explained above.\nThe scripture states: \"Five times paying homage to the Five Emperors purifies the storehouse and viscera.\"\n*Fanfan* describes the soaring appearance. Drifting, they come from the Gate of the Mysterious Above—ancient commentaries take the Gate of the Palace Above as the Gate of the Mysterious Capital.\nThe \"Yellow Wilderness,\" when aligned with the body, is the spleen. The spleen’s mutual generation descends qi to the heart; when spleen-qi is sufficient, it generates the lungs. Thus it is said: \"Strolling through the Yellow Flower Wilderness, returning the spirit to the joyous end.\" The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: \"The numinous terrace, lush and verdant, gazes upon the Yellow Wilderness; the three-inch winged chamber has above and below\"—directly referring to the heart and spleen. Thereupon, gathering the flying ethereal souls to form a person, as time passes, the *hun-shuang* dissolve into ashes. The *Scripture of Precepts and Ranks* states: \"The dead form turns to dust, flying and transforming into *shuang*.\" Thus it is said: \"Gathering the flying ethereal souls, old *shuang* are mostly lost.\" Alas! The disparity between life and death reaches this extremity. The ancients said: \"To lose the human form once is to be irrecoverable for ten thousand kalpas.\" Those in the world who treat life lightly—hearing this, how could they not grieve?\n\nThe Great Tenuous Yellow Banner,\nThe Radiant Pennant commands the numinous.\nSummoning the long-night abode,\nLiberating and receiving the living souls.\nThe Duke’s son assists in Yellow Tranquility,\nRecording in full both form and spirit.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Three Primordials’ Edicts* states: \"Within the Palace of the Great Ultimate are nine names; the third is the Great Tenuous.\"",

of the Three Offices do not reside within.\nThose who perish after birth\ndo so because the spirit of their allotted destiny is not inscribed.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Three Ones* states:\n\"Within

is the Three Perfected of essence and blood,\nnamed the Three Lords of Life,\nstyled Yellow Tranquility,\nwho guard below the nostrils of man.\n\nThus the *Scripture of Salvation* says:\n\"Wu-ying, Duke’s Son,\nWhite Prime, Venerable Spirit.\"\nIt also says: \"Within, the five qi are ordered,\nthe hundred spirits blend and unite.\"\nThen who could surpass the central numinous qi\nin recording

the viscera of the Six Harmonies.\n\nThis chapter contains no mention of nine recitations or nine repetitions,\nbut speaks of the count completing the assembly of all Perfected.\nIf the count does not reach nine,\ntransformation cannot be achieved.\nThough the five viscera are divided,\nthe six bowels are not yet complete—\ntheir number is not yet whole.\nThe universal assembly of all Perfected\nmust await the count to bring it about.\n\"Activating Yang\" refers to the moment of birth.\nFrom this, responses multiply without end,\nso that heavenly spirits and earthly deities\narrive all at once.\nThus jade maidens anoint with the five fragrances,\nand the Holy Mother celebrates for ten thousand years.\nThe five fragrances are:\ngreen wood fragrance,\nwhite sandalwood,\ncogon grass,\nsinking fragrance,\nand frankincense.\nThe Holy Mother is the Holy Mother of the Guardian Chamber.\n\nAs for the Three Realms rejoicing together\nand bowing their heads to the Heavenly

Revered.\n\nEver parting from the Flying Dark Beam.\nAncient commentaries call it a \"bridge-beam,\"\nor else \"Mystic Capital Mountain,\"\nbut these are mere conjectures,\nleading many seekers

liáng* (Dark Beam)\nrefer to a celestial bird.\nWhen the Supreme Perfected Lord of Great Simplicity retired to his retreat,\nthe Three Primordial Ladies of the Upper Clarity rose,\nfacing west to recite the \"Feathered Chapters of Celebrating Perfection\"—\nwithin it is written:\n\"Fluttering and soaring through the nine skies,\nsorrowfully crying, calling the Dark Beam.\"\nSince the scripture

avian nature.\nIf a person refrains from hoarding and losing their celestial perfection,\nfrom scattering thoughts in restless calculation,\nfrom adulterating their right mindfulness—\nif they but tread the constant Way,\nthen they may sever and fell the stagnation of the womb-tree’s roots,\nultimately roaming the Jade Capital.\n\nThe vow, once profoundly profound,\nawakens me to principle and

beginning,\nletting the heart roam and ascend to the Upper Capital.\nOnly by comprehending the profoundly profound Way\ndoes one fulfill that vow.\nForgetting both principle and self—\nwith self, there is attachment;\nwith principle, there is obstruction.\nOnly without self and without principle\ndoes one accord with the profoundly profound Way.\nThe *Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection* records Gong Borong’s poem:\n\"The profoundly profound then arises.\"\nThe profoundly profound is the \"yet more profound.\"\nHaving entered the profoundly profound,\none’s body merges with the Dao,\nand blessings arrive unbidden, naturally auspicious.\n\nMerging transformations return to the Original Unity,\nloftily conjoining the Primordial King of Yuanshi.\nBowing my head, I join

the same origin as Yuanshi’s One Qi—\nthen they themselves are the Three Clarities.\n\"Loftily conjoining\"—\nhow could this resemble the petty immortals of lower ranks?\nThus the *Scripture of the Mysterious Mirror* states:\n\"The Original Unity is the chief of the ten thousand Ways,\nrevolving the wheel alongside the numinous movement,\nbecoming one with heaven and earth.\nWhat burden could the clouds of dust impose?\"\nThis is why *Zhuangzi* discarded Yao and Shun as chaff,\nroaming carefree beyond the dust and grime.\nThus the Lady of Right Radiance said:\n\"Gathering the eight paths

here.\nThe root of the body is governed by the heart,\nwith qi as its function.\nWhere the heart directs, qi follows.\nMencius said:\n\"The will is the commander of qi.\"\nThe will is where the heart

      "translated_text": "The five difficulties depart when principle is followed,\nand the centered heart finds its own joy.\nThe jade chamber’s abode is not merely a place for roaming delight—\nthe Most High intends it to gladden the five spirits.\nFor spirits love harmony and detest discord,\nthus the *Treasury* contains the *Treatise on Nurturing the Spirit*,\nwhich takes harmony as its sole cultivation.\nHow then could those who refine life fail to gladden the spirit?\n\nThe *True Records of Supreme Clarity* states:\nthe two hands, two feet, and heart together form the five spirits.\nWhen the heart’s thoughts remain ever verdant,\nthe two hands ever crimson,\nand the two feet ever white,\none draws near to transcendence.\nElsewhere, the two eyes, two hands, and lung region combine as the five spirits:\nthe left eye’s youth is Flying Numinosity,\nthe right eye’s youth is Morning Infancy,\nthe left hand’s youth is Welcoming Life,\nthe right hand’s youth is Square Fullness,\nand the lung’s youth is Luminous Purity—\nthese are the names of the five spirits.\nOnce the five spirits are gladdened,\none may dispel excessive thoughts.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n“The Dao does not desire杂 (mixed states);杂 brings disturbance,\nhow much more so its excess?”\nWhen excessive thoughts arise,\nforget them through whistling,\nand one may summon luminous companions.\nFor whistling is a prolonged sound.\nThe ancients who cultivated the Dao used it to guide qi,\nthus the *Sutra of Wisdom* says:\n“The numinous banner inhales the wind and scatters,\nexcessive thoughts vanish in their time.”\nOnce excessive thoughts are dispelled,\nthe five difficulties may indeed be resolved by principle.\nThe five difficulties are:\nbestowing kindness despite poverty,\nlearning the Dao despite great wealth,\ncommanding life to avoid death,\nobtaining the *Cavernous Scripture*,\nand being born in the age of a later sage.\nAll five difficulties stem from excessive thoughts;\nwithout them, the heart finds joy of itself.\n\nThe *Scripture of Western Ascent* says:\n“Dispel defilement, halt thoughts,\npurify the heart, and guard the One.”\nFor those who study the Dao,\nthere is no difficulty apart from governing the heart.\nThus, when Perfected Yin took leave of the Most High,\nhe begged once more for a single word\nas the essential key to cultivation.\nThe Most High replied with:\n“Dispel defilement, halt thoughts,\npurify the heart, and guard the One.”\nThus, purifying the heart is the first task of cultivation.\nTo seek the Great Dao without first governing the heart\nis like raising chickens while keeping a wildcat—\nhow could it succeed?\n\nThis chapter concerns the work of the seven transgressions,\nwhere the apertures open and clarity arises.\nWhy speak of this here?\nFor the root of wisdom lies in the heart.\nIf excessive thoughts linger in the heart,\nwisdom may at times grow dim.\nThus, the opening speaks of “mysterious convergence unifying the boundless,”\nand later of “the centered heart finding its own joy”—\nthe remedy is evident.\n\nThe luminous soul follows its root,\nsteadfast in the empty midst.\nSeven recitations unseal the layered gates,\nstagnation disperses without martial force.\nMovement flows from within,\na lofty chant lifts in reverent salute.\n\nHumans possess spirit as a house possesses a dweller.\nIf the house is incomplete,\nthe soul lingers steadfast in the empty midst.\n“Steadfast” describes its force pressing toward the house,\nyet unable to enter.\nThe “root” refers to Non-Brightness taking the liver as its root,\nand White Prime taking the lung as its root.\nAt the time of the seven transgressions,\nthe apertures are fully opened,\nand obstructions dissolve as if by martial prowess—\nvictory without battle.\n\nThe Dao of generating spirit,\nas a thing, is without duality,\nthus its generation of things is unfathomable.\nWhen the spirit’s mechanism and qi are established,\nthere is that which arises unexpectedly—\nfor within it dwells a governing presence.\nWithout a master within, it does not stand;\nwithout a master without, it does not move.\nThus it is said:\n“Movement flows from within,\na lofty chant lifts in reverent salute.”\n\n**The Eighth Chapter of the Scripture of Generating Spirit in the Heaven of Clarity and Brightness**\n**The Qi of the Imperial Perfected’s Flowery Mansion, Commanding the Primordial Numinous Transformation**\n\nAbove the layered heavens of clarity,\nat the juncture of felicitous clouds,\njade verses scatter into the centered heart,\na solitary radiance seeks numinous convergence.\n\nThe heavens possess nine heavens:\nfrom the Vermilion Completion Mansion of Mysterious Continent, the first is the Solar Heaven;\nthe next, the Wind Heaven;\nthe next, the freezing expanse, called the Layered Heaven.\nNow, the lofty void of clarity and brightness lies above the Layered Heaven.\nThe *Scripture of the Jade Dawn’s Radiant Numinosity* asks:\n“How may one push open the gates of the Layered Heaven\nto witness the beginning and end of heaven and earth?”\nThe *Scripture of the Cavernous Numinous Verses* says:\n“Dragons transform above the Layered Heaven,\nthe Brahma vehicle traverses the kalpa’s wheel.”\nThus we know the dragon’s transformation becomes the seed-people,\nand the clarity of heaven and earth connects with the dragon’s celestial realm.\n\nThe *Concealed Instructions on Ascending Perfection*\ncontains Xin Xuanzi’s poem to Lord Yang:\n“Spirit follows the empty and nonexistent,\nqi dissolves into felicitous clouds.”\nThe “jade verses” refer to the chapter on generating spirit,\nwhich may disperse and harmonize the centered heart—\nthus, “jade verses scatter into the centered heart,\na solitary radiance seeks numinous convergence.”\nIt is like the *Scripture of the Pure and Plain on Phoenix Terrace*:\n“Jade nectar scatters into the centered heart,\nbright maidens sing numinous songs.”\n\nResplendent radiance spreads like rosy clouds,\nthe spirit’s lapels leave none behind.\nJade branches flow with ethereal echoes,\nat ease in the void’s wondrous discourse.\n\nAll the above does not record concrete phenomena\nbut describes the scenery of heaven’s midst,\nthe words of roaming feasts.\nThe *Inner Biography of Perfected Yang* records\nPurple Clarity’s True Consort saying:\n“Grasping the sun’s root,\nI enter the feast of the seven palaces,\ntread the three luminaries and ascend together,\nscatter rosy clouds and soar in my carriage.”\n“The spirit’s lapels leave none behind”\nresembles the *Great Cavern’s* hymns:\n“Mysterious songs disperse the spirit’s lapels,\njade branches flow with ethereal echoes.”\nLike Xin Xuanzi’s words:\n“Raising my head to admire the singing branches,\nthe forest’s emptiness holds unbounded joy.”\n\nNuminous sounds vibrate the empty cavern,\nthe nine mysteries depart their dark descendants.\nInspired clarity knows no stagnation,\ndeparture and lingering are like loosening a sash.\n\nHaving beheld the chapter on generating spirit,\nits wondrous workings are beyond knowing.\nIf seen, the nine mysteries escape the dark night,\nand soaring clarity stirs with feeling—\ndeparture and lingering are free,\nno longer stagnant, like loosening a sash.\nIf one recognizes the use of generating spirit,\none may roam above the three realms,\nno longer subject to the calamities of the nine yangs and six yins—\nthus, “without ultimate defeat.”\n\nMysterious radiance illuminates the celestial thoroughfare,\ntraces transcend beyond the spirit’s bounds.",

the Five Peaks.\nSuch heavenly beings are called *without thought*,\n*without entanglement, without attachment*,\nfor their comings and goings are perfectly at ease.\n\nThe Heaven of Great Network lies below the Three Heavens of Great Veil,\nfar removed from the Heaven of No-Form.\nThe question *\"Who says...\"* refers to a tradition that some have visited the Heaven of No-Form,\nwhere many hills and mounds abound.\n*\"Lofty\"* describes the appearance of these mounds.\nWith mind obscured, one wanders freely—\nyet with single-minded focus, the spirit may ascend in purity.\nThis is the moment of true encounter.\nDelay, and the kalpic cycles may shift,\nfor this rare meeting must not be missed.\n\nLong ago, Wang Fangping made an appointment with Ma Gu.\nMa Gu replied: *\"I have not seen you for a while—suddenly five thousand years have passed.\nThough rank and reverence remain in order,\nmy longing to meet you is deep,\nyet I cannot leave at once.\"*\nSuch is the vastness of a true encounter—\nhow can one not believe it?\n\nWith mind obscured, one wanders freely,\nas the Lady of Right Florescence instructed Secretary Xu:\n*\"From the heart’s empty cavern, the ford,\nI take the reins of the crimson carriage.\"*\n*\"Floating clarity clings to the ancient branches,\nreturning to the womb by its own constancy.\"*\nThe spirit stirs the Great Void,\ntreading upon the frost of the celestial heights.\nThe ford’s currents stir a myriad streams,\nwhile hidden concentration lifts the true spirit upward.\nWithout attachment, there is no sorrow—\ngazing from on high, one bows in ascent.\n\nThe scripture begins:\nIn the first chapter, the primordial womb binds long life;\nin the second, the root is severed and the gate of death closed;\nin the third, the hun-soul is born and qi is gathered;\nin the fourth, the spirit-lord gathers qi;\nin the fifth, qi refines the primordial viscera;\nin the sixth, the womb-tree’s stagnation is cut away.\nOnly when the five viscera and six bowels are complete\ndoes the seventh chapter speak of *non-action’s* accomplishment.\n\nYet at the beginning of life, as when founding a dynasty,\nthere are always hardships.\nAfter the seventh stage, one merely maintains what has been achieved.\nThus the ninth chapter simply states:\n*\"Floating clarity clings to the ancient branches,\nreturning to the womb by its own constancy.\"*\nIt awaits only the fulfillment of the lunar cycles\nuntil, grown to maturity,\none’s body harmonizes with the qi of the Nine Heavens.\nThe spirit within is none other than the Three Ones of the Grand Tenuity,\nmerged with the Great Void—\nthus one may tread upon the frost of the celestial heights.\n*\"Treading\"* means *empty travel*.\nThe *Spirit Scripture* says: *\"Treading, I circle the Dark Capital.\"*\n*\"Celestial heights\"* refers to the palaces within heaven.\nThe Lady of Cloud Forest says:\n*\"Dark waves stir the blue-green tides,\nmighty fords stir a myriad streams.\nI gaze upon the Six Voids,\nlonging to wander with my beloved.\"*\nTo ascend the celestial heights,\none must concentrate the mind and congeal the spirit,\nsharing radiance with heaven and earth,\nabiding in constancy with the myriad things.\nYet this concentration of mind and spirit\nbegins with freedom from attachment and sorrow.\n\nThe Lady of the Southern Culmen says:\n*\"From attachment arises sorrow,\nfrom attachment arises fear.\nWithout attachment, there is no sorrow;\nwithout sorrow, there is no fear.\"*\nOnce, a man recited scriptures late at night with deep melancholy,\nyearning for home.\nA Perfected One of the Supreme transformed into an ordinary man\nand asked: *\"Do you often play the zither?\"*\n*\"Yes,\"* he replied.\n*\"What if the strings are slack?\"*\n*\"They do not sound, nor do they grieve.\"*\n*\"And if they are too tight?\"*\n*\"The sound breaks and is harmed.\"*\n*\"Then what if they are neither slack nor tight?\"*\n*\"All notes are harmonious.\"*\nThe Perfected One said: *\"The Dao is the same.\nWhen the mind is well-tempered, the Dao may be attained.\"*\nThus attachment and sorrow\nare the greatest illnesses of the Way.\nHence it is said: *\"Without attachment, there is no sorrow—\ngazing from on high, one bows in ascent.\"*\nThis is what the seeker must devote their heart to.\n\n**Two Hymns of the Perfected One of the Great
