  "full_translation": "**The Annotated Dao De Jing: A Commentary**\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Dao De Jing* (Dao De Zhengjing Zhu). By **Lín Zhìjiān** of the **Rénzhāi** (Ren Zhai) Study. Two volumes.\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), **Tóngshén** (洞神) Section, **Yùjué** (玉诀) Category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the Dao De Jing**\n\nThe Dao is **august** and **virtue** is **noble**—such is the foundation upon which the heavens and earth rest.\nCountless ancient sages and worthy predecessors have left many commentaries on the sacred texts.\n*\"Birth and death\"* (生死) is the method of cultivating one’s self.\n*\"Non-action yet transformation\"* (無為而化) is the profound strategy for governing the world.\n\nThose who **illuminate the heart and perceive true nature** (明心見性) know that the chapter *\"The Mysterious Pivot of the Vital Spirit\"* (谷神不死) is the most sublime.\nStatesmen who **govern well and bring peace to the people** (治國安民) recognize that *\"The Method of Rectifying Governance\"* (以正治國) is deeply profound.\nIn life, nothing surpasses these two.\n\nIn my leisure hours, I quietly contemplated the wondrous classics of the sages and worthies,\nAnd suddenly **awoke to the source of the cosmos’ transformation** (造化之渊源).\nWith humble intent, I forgot my own limitations and **pretended** to follow the **Dao De Jing** of the **Tàishàng Lǎojūn** (太上老君) from beginning to end,\nUsing the **authentic commentary** (正經) to annotate the **authentic text** (正經) below,\n**Interpreting the text with the text itself** (以經解經),\nMerely **grasping a fraction of its meaning** (略知經意).\nHow could I ever **fully penetrate its depths** (表裏相通)?\nYet if one **studies it diligently and savors its words** (熟讀玩味),\nOne will naturally **awaken to the profound mysteries** (解悟) of the **authentic text** (正經).\nThe **gateway to the Dao** (入道之門戶) and the **foundation of virtue** (立德之根基) are thus made clear.\n\n**Sīmǎ Guāng** said:\n*\"It is not the Dao of the ordinary, hence not known by ordinary men.\"* (非常之道，故非常人之所知)\n\n**Zhū Wēngōng** (朱文公) said:\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao.\"* (道而可道，則非常道)\n*\"The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\"* (名而可名，則非常名)\n\nI often pondered deeply:\n*\"Those who claim self-illumination do not truly see.\"* (自見者不明)\n*\"Those who assert self-nature do not truly shine.\"* (自是者不彰)\n\nWith **no fear of presumption** (不避僭越之愆),\nI **cross-referenced** the text—\nHow could this be called a mere **preface and commentary** (序注)?\nHow could it ever be **perfect**? (何能盡善也欤)\n\nMay **future virtuous scholars** (候來之君子) who encounter it **not begrudge** (見之勿吝)\nAnd **must surely refine and correct** (必須刪削，以求斧正),\nFor this would be most **beneficial** (深為良矣).\n\nWritten on a **auspicious day in the sixth lunar month** (孟夏吉日),\nIn the year **Jiǎwù** (甲午) of **Zhìzhèng** (至正) [1344],\nBy **Lín Zhìjiān** of **Guǎnglíng** (廣陵), **Rénzhāi** (仁齋).\n\n---\n\n**The Dao De Jing**\n\nThe Dao is **august** and **virtue** is **noble**—\nYet it **abides naturally** (常自然).\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;\nI do not know its name, so I call it **the Dao**.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name;\nThe Dao **conceals itself without name** (隱無名).\n\n**The Nameless** (無名) is the **origin of the heavens and earth** (天地之始).\nWhen the world has an origin, it is called **the Mother of the World** (天下母).\n**The One** (一) generates **the Two** (二),\n**The Two** generate **the Three** (三),\n**The Three** generate **the Ten Thousand Things** (萬物).\nThe Ten Thousand Things **carry yin and embrace yang** (負陰抱陽),\n**Interpenetrating qi** (沖氣) to achieve **harmony** (和).\nTo know **harmony** is to know **the Constant** (常).\n\nTo know **the Constant** is to be **tolerant** (容),\n**Tolerance** leads to **impartiality** (公),\n**Impartiality** leads to **sovereignty** (王),\n**Sovereignty** leads to **heavenly rule** (天),\n**Heavenly rule** leads to **the Dao** (道).\nThe Dao **operates through natural law** (法自然).\n\nThe **Dao of Heaven** (天之道) benefits without harming;\nIt is like **drawing a bow** (其猶張弓乎).\nThe **high** are **lowered**; the **low** are **raised**,\nThe **lacking** are **supplied**; the **excessive** are **reduced**.\nYet **human governance** (人之道) is not so.\nWho among men can **have surplus to bestow upon the world** (有餘以奉天下)?\nOnly **those who follow the Dao** (有道者).\n\nThe Ten Thousand Things **act without complaint** (作而不辭),\n**Generate without possession** (生而不有),\n**Do without claiming** (為而不恃),\n**Grow without mastering** (長而不宰)—\nThis is called **Mysterious Virtue** (玄德).\n\nThe **Dao of the Sage** (聖人之道) acts without striving,\n**Embraces the One** (抱一) as a **model for the world** (為天下式).\n**Fine words** (美言) can **command respect** (市尊),\n**Good deeds** (行) can **win favor** (加人).\nYet **men’s flaws** (人之不善) are **not cast aside** (何棄之有)?\n\n**The Sage’s virtue** (常善) **rescues men** (救人), hence **no man is abandoned** (故無棄人),\n**The Sage’s virtue** rescues things, hence **no thing is cast off** (故無棄物)—\nThis is called **the Illuminating Pattern** (是謂襲明).\nThus, when **establishing the Son of Heaven** (立天子) and **appointing the Three Ministers** (置三公),\nEven **if one offers the jade tablet with six horses** (雖有拱璧以先驷馬),\nIt is **not as good as simply practicing this Dao** (不如坐進此道).\n\n**When achievement is complete and fame is secured, withdraw** (功成名遂身退)—\nThis is the **Dao of Heaven** (天之道).\n\nI have heard that **those who excel in preserving life** (善摄生者)\n**Walk on land yet meet no rhinoceros or tiger** (陸行不遇兕虎),\n**Enter battle yet are not harmed by weapons or armor** (入軍不被甲兵).\nThe rhinoceros **does not strike with its horn** (兕無投其角),\nThe tiger **cannot place its claws** (虎無所措爪),\nWeapons **cannot reach their blade** (兵無所容其刃).\nWhy so?\nBecause they **abide in the realm of no death** (以其無死地).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter One: The Dao That Can Be Spoken Is Not the Eternal Dao**\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe Dao follows its own nature.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nThe Dao is nameless.\n\nThe nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Dao generates **One** (一).\nThe named is the mother of all things.\n**Three** generates the myriad things.\n\nAlways without desire, one observes its subtlety,\nReaching the utmost emptiness.\nAlways with desire, one observes its peril.\nGuard stillness with sincerity.\n\nThese two, though issuing from the same source yet bearing different names—\nAlways with desire, always without desire—\nAre called the **Mysterious Unity** (玄同).\nThe **Mysterious Unity**, again mysterious,\nIs the gateway to all wonders.\nThe **Gate of the Mysterious Female** (玄牝之门),\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: Nurturing Life**\nAll under Heaven know beauty when it is called beauty—\nThen ugliness already exists.\nThe Dao is in accord with the Dao.\nAll know goodness when it is called good—\nThen evil already exists.\n**Virtue/power** (德) is in accord with **virtue/power**.\n\nThus, being and non-being generate each other:\nAll things under Heaven arise from being,\nBeing arises from non-being.\nDifficulty and ease give rise to each other:\nMuch ease necessarily brings much difficulty.\nLong and short define each other—\nThis is called the form of the formless.\nHigh and low lean upon each other:\nThe high necessarily takes the low as its foundation.\nSounds harmonize with each other:\nThe Dao is boundless yet effective in its use.\nBefore and after follow each other:\nApproaching, one sees no head;\nFollowing, one sees no tail.\n\nThus, the Sage acts in affairs of non-action,\nDoing nothing yet nothing remains undone.\nTeaching without speech,\nRarely speaking yet naturally effective.\nAll things arise yet he does not claim them,\nCreating yet not possessing,\nThe Dao as a thing.\nWhen achievement is complete, he does not dwell upon it—\nOnly because he does not dwell upon it does he not depart.\nWhen achievement is complete and fame is secured, withdraw—\nThe Dao of Heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three: Settling the People**\n**Concentrate the qi and attain softness**—\nOne can embrace an infant.\n**Block the orifice** (塞其兑), **close the gate** (閉其門),\n**Empty the mind** (虚其心), **fill the belly** (实其腹),\n**Weaken the will** (弱其志), **strengthen the bones** (强其骨)—\nThis is called **deep-rooted and firmly anchored** (深根固蒂),\nThe Dao of **long life and enduring vision** (长生久视).\n\n**Govern the great realm as one cooks a small fish**—\nThe great should act as the lowly,\nNot daring to assert strength.\nWith the Dao to govern the world,\nIts spirits will not be formidable.\n\n**Assisting the sovereign with the Dao**—\nOne does not use force to compel the world.\nSuch affairs will naturally return.\n**Fine weapons are ominous instruments**,\nNot the tools of the **Noble One** (君子).\nThey are used only when unavoidable.\nWhen using force, one says:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,\nNot daring to advance an inch yet retreat a foot.\"*\nWhy so?\n**He who abandons what comes after for what comes first is already dead.**\n\nThus the Sage says:\n*\"I do nothing yet the people transform themselves,\nI take no action yet the people grow rich,\nI desire nothing yet the people return to simplicity,\nI value stillness yet the people become upright.\nIf one does not desire to remain still,\nThe world will naturally settle itself.\"*\n\n---\n\n**The Proper Sequence of the Canon**\nHow then is the **Canon** (正经) arranged in order?\nIt is said:\nThe Dao is the **ancestral origin** (宗祖) that generates all things,\nThe **fundamental root** (根元) that divides Heaven and Earth.\nThe Dao precedes Heaven and Earth,\nGenerating Heaven and Earth,\nAn enduring Dao since antiquity.\nThus, the Dao’s preeminence is placed first in the sequence.\n\nThe Dao generates **One** (一).\n**One** generates **Two** (二).\nWhen yin and yang are divided,\nThe light and clear ascend as Heaven,\nThe heavy and turbid descend as Earth.\nThus, the Dao of Heaven follows next.\n\n**Two** generates **Three** (三).\nYin and yang rise and fall,\nAnd between them, humanity is formed.\nThus, the Dao of the Sage follows next.\n\nThe **Three Powers** (三才) are complete.\nTherefore, **cultivating the self is the foundation**—\nThus, it is heard that those who excel in preserving life follow next.\nCultivating the self extends to governing the realm and pacifying the world—\nThus, *\"governing the great realm as one cooks a small fish\"* follows next.\nWhen applied, it fills the space between Heaven and Earth;\nWhen withdrawn, it is hidden within the six directions.\nAffairs have beginnings and ends,\nThings have roots and branches.\nThus, the **Canon** is arranged in this order alone.\n\n**Chapter Three: Governing with Virtue**\n\nDo not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend.\nLove oneself without esteeming oneself.\nDo not prize rare treasures, so the people do not steal.\nAbandon cleverness and discard profit, then thieves will vanish.\nMake no desires visible, so the heart remains undisturbed.\nPurify and refine—how could there be any flaw?\nThus, the Sage governs:\nEstablishing the Son of Heaven,\nEmptying the heart—great virtue is like a valley.\nFilling the belly—embracing the One, how could it depart?\nWeakening the will—concentrating qi to attain softness.\nStrengthening the bones—holding to softness is strength.\nAlways keep the people without knowledge or desire.\nGood governance lies here.\nLet the wise dare not act.\nTo love the people and govern the realm—how could it be without action?\nTo act without action, then nothing remains untamed.\nI act without action, and the people transform themselves.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Profound Use**\n\nThe Dao is boundless yet applied—\nIts harmony is supreme.\nIt is never full.\nGreat fullness is like emptiness.\nDeep as if the root of all things,\nThe Dao is the hidden essence of all things.\nDulling the sharp, unraveling the tangled,\nHolding to the ancient Way.\nDimming its radiance, blending with dust.\nMuddled as if turbid.\nDark as if stored,\nEndless as if preserved.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nThe image of the Sovereign before Heaven.\nI do not know its name—\nCall it *Dao*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Five: The Chapter of Empty Use**\n\nHeaven and Earth are not kind—they treat all things as straw dogs.\nThey give life yet do not possess.\nThe Sage is not kind—they treat the people as straw dogs.\nThey act yet do not rely.\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nIs it not like a bellows?\nVast as a valley,\nEmpty yet unyielding—\nGreat virtue is like a valley.\nThe more it moves, the more it emerges—\nMove in perfect timing.\nMany words lead to exhaustion—\nThe speaker does not know.\nBetter to hold to the center.\nThe wise do not speak.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Six: The Chapter of Formed Images**\n\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nThe Way of eternal life and clear vision.\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe ancients valued this Way.\nThe Mysterious Female’s gate—\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Dao is the hidden essence of all things.\nEndless as if preserved,\nDiligently practiced.\nUsed without strain.\nThe Dao is boundless yet applied.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Chapter of Concealing Light**\n\nHeaven is enduring, Earth is long-lasting.\nThose of old who attained the One—\nHeaven and Earth endure long because they embrace the One without separation.\nSince they do not generate themselves, they attain eternal life.\nThey give life yet do not possess.\nThus, the Sage puts himself last, yet comes first.\nTo lead the people, he must place himself behind them.\nDetaching himself, he preserves himself.\nUsing what is not, he achieves utility.\nNot because he is without self-interest—\nThus, he fulfills his own.\nTherefore, the Sage finds it difficult,\nYet in the end, there is no difficulty.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Chapter of Changing Nature**\n\nThe highest goodness is like water.\nConcentrating qi to attain softness.\nWater benefits all things without contention,\nBending preserves it whole.\nDwelling where others abhor—\nThus, it approaches the Dao.\nNothing is softer or weaker than water,\nYet it excels in occupying low ground.\nTimid as if fearing its neighbors.\nThe heart is deep—\nGreat virtue is like a valley.\nKindness is benevolent—\nHeaven’s Way has no favorites, always aiding the good.\nWords are trustworthy—\nNo words are spoken, yet all respond.\nGovernance is good—\nRule the realm with rectitude.\nActions are skillful—\nAct without action.\nMove in perfect timing—\nHold to the ancient Way.\nOnly by not contending\nIs there no blame.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Chapter of Even Flow**\n\nHolding to fullness is not as good as stopping in time.\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril.\nSharpening the blade cannot be preserved long.\nFine weapons are inauspicious instruments.\nGold and jade fill the halls—\nNo one can guard them.\nExcessive love brings great expenditure.\nRich and noble yet arrogant—\nThey invite their own ruin.\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace.\nWhen achievement is complete and fame is secured, withdraw—\nThis is Heaven’s Way.\nAchievement complete, yet unnamed—\nThis is the power of the able.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Ten: The Chapter of Embracing the One**\n\nNurturing the spirit and embracing the One—\nHow could it separate?\nThe good at embracing do not lose it.\nConcentrating qi to attain softness—\nOne can be like an infant.\nHarmony is supreme.\nPurify and refine—\nHow could there be any flaw?\nAlways without desire, observing its subtlety.\nLoving the people and governing the realm—\nHow could it be without action?\nI act without action, and the people transform themselves.\nHeaven’s gate opens and shuts—\nHow could it be without the Feminine?\nAll things carry yin and embrace yang.\nClear and boundless—\nHow could it be without knowing?\nThough knowing, it is great confusion—\nThis is called the essential mystery.\nNourishing and preserving—\nAll things act together.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Chapter of the Utility of the Non-Utilitarian**\n\nThirty spokes converge at one hub,\nYet all things revere the Dao and honor virtue.\nWhen its utility is absent, the vehicle’s function remains.\nVast as the valley, it is empty.\n\nMolded clay forms vessels,\nYet before the vessel exists, there is a thing of mixed unity,\nBorn prior to heaven and earth.\nWhen its utility is absent, the vessel’s function remains.\n\nHollow out the heart—\nPierce doors and windows to create a dwelling.\nThe Dao is the hidden mystery of all things.\nWhen its utility is absent, the dwelling’s function remains.\n\nLike the bellows of a bagpipe.\n\nThus, having gives rise to advantage,\nYet all things obtain the One to generate.\nWithout gives rise to utility.\n\nAct without action, and nothing remains ungoverned.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Chapter of Restraining Desires**\n\nFive hues blind the eyes;\nThe common people see clearly.\nFive tones deaf the ears;\nThe common people hear distinctly.\nFive flavors dull the palate;\nOne loathes eating and drinking.\nGalloping and hunting make the heart frenzied.\nLightness leads to losing one’s ministers,\nImpetuosity leads to losing one’s king.\nHard-to-obtain treasures bring misfortune.\nNo sin is greater than the desire for gain.\n\nTherefore, the sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes.\nThus, he discards that and takes this.\n\nHe dwells in substance, not in its splendor.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: The Chapter of Disdaining Shame**\n\nFavor and insult are like a sudden fright—\nStiff as though ice were about to shatter.\nTreasure great misfortune as one’s own body—\nCautious as though crossing a river in winter.\n\nWhat is meant by *favor and insult*?\nKnow its honor and guard against its disgrace.\nDisgrace is lowly.\nGain it as though in fright, lose it as though in fright—\nThis is called *favor and insult are like a sudden fright*.\n\nWealth brings responsibility, yet arrogance invites blame.\nWhat is meant by *treasure great misfortune as one’s own body*?\nWhich is closer: name or body?\nThe reason I have great misfortune is that I have a body.\nExclude the body, yet the body remains.\nWhen I have no body, what misfortune do I have?\nGain and loss—what is more harmful?\nTherefore, he who values his body as the world\nCan entrust himself to the world.\nHe who is self-conceited does not endure.\nHe who loves his body as the world\nCan commit himself to the world.\nHe loves himself but does not value himself.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Chapter of Praising the Mysterious**\n\nSee it, yet it cannot be seen—called *level*.\nSee it, yet it is not enough to see.\nHear it, yet it cannot be heard—called *rare*.\nHear it, yet it is not enough to hear.\nGrasp it, yet it cannot be obtained—called *subtle*.\nThe great image is formless.\nThese three cannot be forced to explain.\n\nSubtle, mysterious, and penetrating—\nDeep, beyond recognition.\nThus, they merge into One.\nIts attainment is One.\n\nAbove, it does not dazzle;\nBelow, it does not obscure.\nIt harmonizes its light.\n\nFaint and indistinct, beyond naming—\nThe Dao is always without name.\nReturning to the formless, this is called the *state of the stateless*.\nDazed and blurred,\nYet within it, there is an image.\nThe image of the formless—\nThis is called *blurred and dazed*.\n\nThe Dao as a thing\nIs only blurred and only indistinct.\nApproach it, yet you do not see its head;\nFollow it, yet you do not see its tail.\nSwift as the sea, drifting without end.\n\nCling to the ancient Dao to govern the present,\nThe world has a beginning,\nAnd the Dao is the mother of the world.\n\nWith knowledge of the ancient beginning, this is called the *Dao’s foundation*.\nFrom ancient times to the present, its name does not fade.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Manifest Virtue**\n\nThe ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, profound, and penetrating—\nDeep beyond recognition.\nRich in virtue’s depth,\nYet because they could not be recognized,\nThey feigned outward forms.\n\nThe Dao as a thing\nIs only blurred and indistinct.\nCautious as winter crossing a river,\nOnly action is to be feared.\nTimid as one wary of neighbors,\nKnowing white yet holding to black.\nSolemn as a guest,\nSeeing simplicity, embracing purity.\nDissolving as ice about to thaw,\nCautious as winter crossing a river.\nGenuine as uncarved wood,\nClad in coarse cloth yet holding jade.\nVast as a valley,\nThus the Dao’s presence in the world.\n\nMuddled as turbid waters,\nHarmonizing its light.\nWho can endure turbidity long?\nStillness, and clarity comes gradually.\nDiligently guard stillness.\nWho can endure rest long?\nMotion, and life arises gradually.\nRich in virtue’s depth.\n\nThose who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness—\nGreat fullness is like emptiness.\nOnly because it is not full\nCan it endure without renewal.\nAdvancing the Dao is like retreating.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Returning to the Root**\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Purity of the Primordial Way**\n---\nWhen emptiness is fully attained,\nVast as a valley, it stands.\nIf lords and kings could steadfastly preserve stillness,\nAll things would come to them of their own accord.\n\nWhen all things flourish together,\nI observe their return.\nThe Way’s motion is in reversal.\nAll things, myriad and teeming,\nEach return to their own root.\n\nHaving known their offspring,\nReturn and guard their mother.\nReturning to the root is stillness,\nStillness is the restoration of life.\nUsing its radiance, returning to its brightness—\nRestoration of life is constancy,\nEver-cycling without end.\n\nKnowing constancy is brightness,\nThe Great Way is most smooth.\nNot knowing constancy,\nActing recklessly brings ruin.\n\nTrue reversal is the marvelous,\nVirtuous reversal is the strange.\nWhen the people are deluded, their error grows long.\n\nKnowing constancy and embracing it,\nLords and kings take this as the rectitude for all under heaven.\nEmbrace is the universal,\nThe universal is the kingly,\nThe kingly is the heavenly,\nThe heavenly is the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is the hidden essence of all things.\nThe Dao endures—\nLifelong without peril.\nNon-Dao fades swiftly.\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Noble Wind**\n---\nThe Noble Way is lost,\nThen benevolence and righteousness arise.\nWhen the Way is lost,\nThen virtue appears.\nWhen wisdom emerges,\nGreat deceit flourishes.\nTo rule the state with wisdom,\nIs to be a thief to the state.\n\nThe six bonds are discordant,\nYet filial piety and kindness exist.\nSevering benevolence and discarding righteousness,\nThe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nThe state falls into chaos,\nYet loyal ministers appear.\nTo love the people and govern the state,\nCan one truly do nothing?\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Restoring Simplicity**\n---\nSevering the Sage, discarding wisdom,\nThe people gain a hundredfold.\nI act with no contrivance,\nAnd the people prosper naturally.\nSevering benevolence and discarding righteousness,\nThe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nI have no desires,\nAnd the people remain simple.\nSevering cleverness and discarding gain,\nThieves and robbers cease to exist.\nThe difficult-to-obtain is not prized.\n\n「For these three things as ornamentation are insufficient,\nTo illuminate the Dao as if in darkness.\nThus, they lead people to have their own affiliations.\nI will take them as my teaching father.\n\nSeeing the plain and embracing simplicity,\nOne in coarse garments holds jade within.\nWith few private concerns and scant desires,\nI always have no desires to observe its subtlety.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Rejecting Learning and Worry**\n---\nRejecting learning and abandoning care,\nThe Dao subtly flows, mysterious and profound.\nHow far apart are *wu* and *ā*?\nThese two arise from the same source yet bear different names.\n\nHow far apart are good and evil?\nHow distant are *wu* and *ā*?\nThat which people fear,\nOne must indeed fear—\nIf the people do not fear authority,\nThen great tyranny will surely come.\nBoundless and ceaseless is its depth,\nSwift as the sea.\n\nThe common folk rejoice and thrive,\nAs if feasting on grand sacrificial offerings,\nAs if ascending to Spring Terrace.\nIn wealth and honor, they grow arrogant,\nYet I alone stand in dread—\nIts signs not yet revealed,\nLike an infant yet to speak.\n\nThe depth of my virtue compares to that of a newborn.\nSteadfast and unshaken,\nAs if having nowhere to return.\n\nCompare the Dao in the world:\nThe common folk all have surplus,\nTheir brilliance evident.\nYet I alone seem abandoned,\nMy virtue built as if by stealth.\nMy heart is that of a foolish man—\nPure and unadulterated.\n\nShining yet not dazzling,\nThe common folk, though bright,\nSee themselves yet fail to understand.\nI alone seem dim,\nIlluminating the Dao as if in shadow.\nThe common folk, though keen,\nThe learned yet do not know.»\n\nI alone am murky and obscure.\nAdvancing the Dao seems like retreat.\n\nDrifting like the sea, yet boundless—\nFloating like a vessel with no shore.\n\nThe boundless has no corners.\n\nThe common folk all have their own ways,\nYet they do not know the sickness of knowing.\nI alone seem dull and coarse,\nYet follow the Dao as if by nature.\n\nI alone differ from others,\nYet hold the Mother of All in highest esteem.\n\nThe profound virtue is deep and distant,\nOpposed to all things.\n\n**Chapter 21: The Virtue of the Empty Heart**\nThe bearing of the sage’s virtue\nFollows the Dao alone.\nThe highest virtue is like a valley.\n\nThe Dao as a thing\nIs only vague, only hazy.\nThe great image has no form.\nHazy and vague, yet within it lies the image.\nThe image of a formless thing—\nThis is called vague and hazy.\n\nVague and hazy, yet within it lies the thing.\nThis is called the form of formlessness.\nDim and shadowy, yet within it lies the essence.\nAll things arise from existence,\nExistence from non-existence.\nIts essence is most true,\nWithin it lies sincerity.\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nIts lower depths are not murky.\nFrom ancient times to today,\nIts name has never faded.\nHold the ancient Dao to govern the present existence,\nTo observe the common folk.\nBy what do I know the common folk’s nature?\nBy this.\n\nAll under heaven know beauty to be beauty—\n\n**Chapter 22: The Harmony of Contraries**\nThe crooked is complete,\n\n**Chapter 22: The Harmony of Contraries (continued)**\nWeaken their resolve.\nThe crooked becomes straight,\nEmpty their minds.\nThe hollow becomes full.\nExpand virtue as though it were insufficient—\nThen it is renewed.\nGreat brightness as though it were shame—\nThen one gains much.\n\nFew words bring clarity,\nThe wise do not speak.\nMany words bring confusion,\nThose who speak do not know.\n\nThus the Sage holds *One* as the model for all under heaven,\nWhile lords and kings use *One* as the standard for all under heaven.\nNot self-illuminating, hence clarity,\nSelf-illuminating, hence no clarity.\nNot self-affirming, hence brilliance,\nSelf-affirming, hence no brilliance.\nNot self-praising, hence merit,\nSelf-praising, hence no merit.\nNot self-exalting, hence longevity,\nSelf-exalting, hence no longevity.\n\nOnly he who does not contend\nCan thus have no rival in all under heaven.\nOnly he who does not contend\nCan thus have no grievance.\n\nWas the ancient saying *\"The crooked is complete\"* mere idle talk?\nIndeed, it is complete and returns to *One*.\n\nHe who dwells where others abhor\nComes close to the Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 23: The Chapter of Emptiness and Non-Existence**\nRarely speak, yet it is natural.\nName without seeing,\nAchieve without doing.\n\nThe gusting wind does not last a morning,\nThe sudden rain does not last a day.\nWithout grasping, there is no loss.\nWho does this?\nHeaven and Earth—\nThe Dao’s most honored.\n\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot endure long,\nHow much less so man?\nHeaven too will know this.\n\nThus those who follow the Dao\nAre in harmony with the Dao.\nThe faithful, I trust them.\nThe virtuous, I align with their virtue.\nThe good, I praise their goodness.\nThe fallen, I share their loss.\nBut if there is no trust,\nThose in harmony with the Dao\nFind the Dao rejoices in them.\nAll under heaven know beauty as beauty—\nThe virtuous find virtue rejoices in them.\nAll under heaven know goodness as goodness—\nThe fallen find loss rejoices in them.\nFine words are not trusted.\nTrust is insufficient—\nThere is no trust.\nSelf-illuminating, hence no clarity—\nThe common folk are bright and clear.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 24: The Chapter of Noble Humility**\nThe limping cannot stand,\nThe straddling cannot walk.\nMany words exhaust one’s resources—\nBetter to hold to the center.\n\nSelf-illuminating, hence no clarity,\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning.\nSelf-affirming, hence no brilliance,\nThe common folk are keen and observant.\nSelf-praising, hence no merit,\nAll men have their own rewards.\nSelf-exalting, hence no longevity,\nLow virtue does not lose its virtue.\n\nAs for the Dao,\nIt says: *\"Excess food, superfluous movement.\"*\nThe Great Dao is smooth, yet men love narrow paths.\nSome may hate it,\nThus the Dao does not dwell among them.\n\nGood deeds leave no tracks.\nThe Chapter of the Original Image\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 25: The Chapter of the Original Image (continued)**\nThere is a thing, formless and complete,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\nThe Dao gave birth to it,\nVirtue nurtured it.\nSilent and vast—\nThe great image has no form.\n\nIt stands alone yet never changes,\nIt moves in cycles yet never begins.\nLong-lasting is he who does not lose his place.\nHe can be the mother of all under heaven.\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nI do not know its name,\nSo I call it the Dao.\nThe Dao is hidden, nameless.\nIf forced to name it, I call it *Great*.\nThe Dao follows natural law.\n*Great* is called *Passing*,\nThe great square has no corners.\n*Passing* is called *Far*,\nSwift as the sea.\n*Far* is called *Return*.\n*Return* is the movement of the Dao.\n\nThus the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nThe king is great.\nThe Dao’s most honored.\n\nWithin the central realm are the Four Great Ones,\nAnd the king is one of them.\nThus the Son of Heaven is established.\nMan follows Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows natural law.\nThus they merge as One.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 26: The Chapter of Weighty Virtue**\nWeighty virtue is the root of lightness,\nHigh must have low as its foundation.\nStillness is the master of agitation,\nStillness overcomes heat.\nThus the noble man walks all day\nWithout leaving his burdens behind.\nHe stands alone yet never changes,\nThough adorned with splendor,\nHe rests in transcendence.\nHe clings steadfastly to stillness.\n\nHow can the lord of ten thousand chariots\nLighten himself for all under heaven?\nHe who loves to bear the weight of all under heaven\nCan thus entrust himself to all under heaven.\nLightness leads to losing his ministers,\nAgitation leads to losing his subjects.\nPurity and clarity belong to all under heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 27: The Chapter of Skillful Action**\n\n**Chapter 27: The Chapter of Skillful Action**\n\nSkillful action leaves no trace,\nAction without action.\nSkillful speech leaves no flaw or blemish,\nAction without the need for words.\nSkillful planning does not rely on calculations,\nYet when used, it cannot be exhausted.\nSkillful closure requires no locks or bars yet cannot be opened,\nYet holding to the One, he never departs.\nSkillful binding needs no cords or knots yet cannot be undone.\nHe stands alone yet never changes.\nThus the sage always acts with beneficence,\nAnd so there are no abandoned people—\nHis words are treasured by all.\nHe always acts with beneficence toward all things,\nAnd so there are no abandoned things.\nHis actions are revered by all under heaven.\nThis is called *clinging to clarity*.\nHe employs its radiance,\nYet returns to its clarity.\nThus the good man is not the teacher of the unworthy,\nThe *Dao* is honored.\nThe unworthy become the good man’s aid,\nYet virtue nurtures them.\nHe does not esteem his teacher,\nHe loves himself yet does not exalt himself.\nHe does not love his aid,\nThe *Dao* is ever without action.\n\nThough wise, yet greatly confused,\nThis is called the *essential mystery*.\nThe *Dao* is smooth yet varied.\nReturning to simplicity is like returning to nature.\nKnow its strength,\nYet hold to its weakness.\nThe receptive always overcomes the active through stillness.\nBe the valley of all under heaven.\nCompare the *Dao*’s presence in all under heaven—\nBe the valley of all under heaven,\nYet virtue never strays.\nHolding to the One, he never departs.\nReturn to the infant.\nThe depth of his virtue is like that of a newborn.\nKnow its whiteness,\nYet hold to its blackness,\nRadiant yet not dazzling.\nBe the model of all under heaven.\nHolding to the One, he is the model of all under heaven.\nBe the model of all under heaven,\nYet virtue never falters.\nKnowing constancy is wisdom.\nReturn to the boundless.\nIts use is inexhaustible.\n\nKnow its splendor,\nYet hold to its humiliation,\nKnowing contentment brings no shame.\nBe the valley of all under heaven.\nUnfathomable like the sea.\nBe the valley of all under heaven,\nYet virtue is ever sufficient.\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril.\nReturn to simplicity.\nThe humble in rags yet holding jade within.\n\nSimplicity, when scattered, becomes vessels.\nAll things blend in unity,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\nThe sage employs them,\nYet they become rulers and officials.\nThus great measures are not cut short.\nHigh virtue acts without action.\n\n**Chapter 29: The Chapter of Non-Action**\nWhen one seeks to take all under heaven by force,\nI see it as not inevitable.\nTaking all under heaven is always done without strife.\nAll under heaven is a divine vessel—\nIt cannot be forced.\nThus without action comes no defeat.\nThe one who acts brings defeat upon himself,\nThe one who grasps loses.\nWithout grasping comes no loss.\nThus some things act, some follow,\nThe latter always align with the former.\nSome exhale, some inhale,\nTheir sounds harmonize.\nSome are strong, some weak,\nYet strength leads to decline.\nSome are raised, some toppled,\nHigh and low balance each other.\nThus the sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids arrogance.\nHe dwells in substance, not in ornament.\nThis is called *modest military virtue*.\n\n**Chapter 31: The Chapter of Laying Down Arms**\nHe who aids the ruler with the *Dao*\nDoes not use force to dominate all under heaven.\nWhen he governs all under heaven with the *Dao*,\nIts spirits are not feared.\nHis undertakings are well-received.\nWhen one seeks to seize it,\nHe must first firmly give it.\nWhere the army encamps,\nBriars and thorns grow.\nSome things oppose it,\nThus the one who holds the *Dao* does not dwell there.\nAfter great armies, there will surely be years of hardship.\nSkillful action leaves no trace.\nThus the good man is resolute yet unassuming—\nAll under heaven know virtue as virtue,\nYet the unworthy do not.\nHe does not dare to take by force.\nThe forceful will not meet their end.\nResolute yet not boastful,\nAvoid excess.\nResolute yet not arrogant,\nAvoid arrogance.\nResolute yet not proud,\nAvoid extravagance.\nResolute yet not forced,\nNot forced yet used.\nResolute yet not strong.\nHe does not dare to take by force.\nStrength leads to decline—\nThis is called *not the Dao*.\n*Not the Dao* brings early ruin.\nThe obstinate meet death.\nThus the sage lays down arms.\n\n**Chapter 32: The Chapter of the Sage’s Virtue**\nThe *Dao* is ever nameless.\nThough simplicity is small,\nAll under heaven dare not submit to it.\nIf I were to know it with certainty,\nOnly reverence would follow.\nThe lords and kings, if they could guard it,\nAll things would come of their own accord.\nThus virtue returns to its source.\nHeaven and earth unite,\nAll things receive the yin and embrace the yang,\nDescending sweet dew,\nThe *Dao* gives birth to them.\nNo one commands them,\nYet they are naturally balanced.\nThus constancy is ever natural.\nAt first, simplicity had no name.\nOnce named, it was named.\nKnowing the ancient origin,\nThis is called the *Dao’s* record.\nEven heaven would know it.\nThe *Dao* can be spoken of,\nYet knowing this prevents no danger.\nKnowing constancy is wisdom.\nCompare the *Dao*’s presence in all under heaven—\nLike rivers and valleys to the sea.\nThe great *Dao* flows freely,\nIt cannot be confined to left or right.\n\n**Chapter 33: The Chapter of Discerning Virtue***\nTo know others is wisdom,\nYet to discern is not virtue.\nTo know oneself is clarity.\nThose of old who attained the One—\nThe one who conquers has strength,\nYet today he abandons kindness and relies on courage.\nThe one who overcomes himself is strong,\nStrengthening his resolve.\nThe one who knows contentment is rich,\nYet gold and jade fill his halls and he cannot guard them.\nThe one who acts resolutely has purpose,\nCircumventing all without failing.\nThe one who does not lose his place endures long,\n\n**Chapter 34: The Chapter of Natural Simplicity**\n\nStand alone yet never alter.\nDie yet never perish—this is longevity.\nDetach from the self, and the self endures.\n\nThe great *Dao* flows freely,\nIt cannot be confined to left or right.\nThe perfect square has no corners.\nAll things rely on it to live yet it does not claim them.\nHeaven and Earth act without kindness,\nTreating all things as mere fodder for dogs.\n\nWhen the work is done, claim no merit.\nWhen the work is done and the name secured, withdraw—\nThis is the *Dao* of Heaven.\nNurture all things yet claim no mastery,\nGive birth yet do not possess.\nThus, to always lack desire,\nOne may be called *small*.\nThough crude and small,\nThe world dares not enslave it.\nAll things return to it yet it claims no mastery—\nThis may be called *great*.\nIf lords and kings could guard this,\nAll things would transform of their own accord.\nThus, the Sage never seeks greatness,\nAnd so achieves greatness.\n\nThe highest virtue lacks virtue,\nAnd so possesses virtue.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 35: The Chapter of Virtuous Power**\n\nHold the great image,\nAnd all under heaven will come.\nLords and kings who attain the One\nUse it to rectify the world.\nGo forth yet cause no harm,\nBringing peace and ease.\nAll things return to it yet it claims no mastery.\nDelight and bait—\nPassing travelers rest.\nAll know goodness as goodness.\nWhen the *Dao* leaves the mouth,\nIts taste is bland and insipid—\nWho can fathom its depth?\nLook upon it, yet it cannot be seen—\nThe great image is formless.\nListen to it, yet it cannot be heard—\nThe great sound is rare.\nUse it, yet it is never exhausted.\nIts use is endless.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 36: The Chapter of Subtle Brilliance**\n\nWhen you wish to gather, first spread wide.\nThe graspers lose it.\nWhen you wish to weaken, first strengthen.\nThe soft overcomes the hard.\nWhen you wish to destroy, first establish.\nSubtract to increase.\nWhen you wish to take, first give.\nAdd to diminish.\nThis is called subtle brilliance,\nA profound virtue.\nThe soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.\nThe weak is the *Dao*’s use.\nFish cannot escape the depths—\nThe skillful embrace does not lose.\nThe state’s sharpest tools\nMust not be shown to the people.\nThe world’s divine instruments\nCannot be wielded.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 37: The Chapter of Governance**\n\nThe *Dao* acts without action,\nYet nothing remains undone.\nThus, the Sage dwells in non-action.\nIf lords and kings could guard this,\nAll things would transform of their own accord.\nHold the great image,\nAnd all under heaven will come.\nTransform yet do not force—\nThe people fear no threats.\nI will govern them with stillness,\nUsing the *Dao* to rule the world.\nWith the nameless crude,\nIt is named yet unseen.\nThe nameless crude—\nIt also desires nothing.\nI desire nothing, yet the people transform of their own accord.\nDesire nothing to remain still—\nThe world will rectify itself.\nI love stillness, and the people will rectify themselves.\n\n**Chapter 39: The Chapter of the One**\n\nOf old, those who attained the One\nCould be spoken of as *Dao*.\nHeaven, by the One, attains clarity,\nAnd the *Dao* gives birth to the One.\nEarth, by the One, attains tranquility,\nAnd thus knows the ancient beginning.\nThe *Spirit* (神), by the One, attains responsiveness,\nAnd the *Taoist Sage* (太上) knows what is.\nThe *Valley* (谷), by the One, attains fullness,\nAnd the *Dao* gives birth to it.\nAll things, by the One, attain life,\nAnd *virtue* (德) nurtures them.\nLords and kings, by the One, establish order for the world.\nEmbrace the One to serve as a model for the world.\nThis is how the One is attained.\nThe *Dao* is the hidden mystery of all things.\nIf Heaven lacks clarity,\nIt will fear collapse,\nAnd the great *Dao* will be abandoned.\nIf Earth lacks tranquility,\nIt will fear upheaval,\nAnd the ancient ways will be unknown.\nIf the *Spirit* lacks responsiveness,\nIt will fear stagnation,\nAnd the *Dao* will already have vanished.\nIf the *Valley* lacks fullness,\nIt will fear exhaustion,\nAnd will bring ruin upon itself.\nIf all things lack the One to sustain them,\nThey will fear annihilation—\nThis is called *non-Dao*.\nIf lords and kings lack the One to ennoble them,\nThey will fear decline.\nIf they are rich and noble yet arrogant,\nThen nobility must take humility as its foundation,\nThe great must take the lowly as its base,\nThe high must take the lowly as its support.\nHe who best uses people is lowly.\nThus, lords and kings call themselves *lonely* (孤), *widowed* (寡), *unworthy* (不毂).\nThe *virtue* of the highest is not virtuous—\nIs this not taking humility as its foundation?\nThus, nobility must take humility as its foundation.\nIs this not so?\nHence, the fewest carriages are the most honored.\nShine without dazzling—\nDo not desire brilliance like jade,\nNor solidity like stone.\nIt cannot be seized to make noble,\nNor seized to make lowly.\n\n**Chapter 40: The Chapter of Returning**\n\nThe *Dao* moves by reversing,\nEach returning to its root.\nThe weak is the *Dao*’s use.\nFocus the *qi* (氣) to govern the soft.\nThe world’s myriad things arise from the *Having* (有),\nAnd the *Having* arises from the *Non-Having* (无).\nThe *Dao* gives birth to the One,\nThe One gives birth to the Two,\nThe Two gives birth to the Three,\nAnd the Three gives birth to all things.\n\n**Chapter 41: The Chapter of Similarity and Difference**\n\nThe superior man hears the *Dao* and strives to practice it.\nOf old, those who excelled in the *Dao*...\nThe middle man hears the *Dao* and holds it as if it were something,\nAs if it were nothing—\nWho knows its limit?\nThe lowly man hears the *Dao* and laughs at it.\nIf he does not laugh, it is not the *Dao*.\nThe people’s confusion!\nThus, I establish words and names,\nThus, I command things to have their proper places.\nThe *Dao* is clear yet seems obscure,\nShining yet not dazzling.\nThe *Dao* is plain yet seems unlike others,\nKnowing its white yet guarding its black.\nAdvancing the *Dao* seems like retreat,\nGreat achievement seems like a lack.\nThe highest *virtue* seems like a *Valley*,\nEmptying the mind.\nThe greatest purity seems like shame,\nThe greatest rectitude seems like bending.\nGreat skill seems like clumsiness,\nGreat wisdom seems like folly.\nGreat eloquence seems like inarticulateness,\nThe wise do not speak.\nThe *Dao* is hidden and nameless,\nUnseen yet named.\nOnly the *Dao* is good at lending itself and completing its work.\nThe *Dao* is the hidden mystery of all things.\n\n**Chapter 42: The Chapter of *Dao* Transformation**\n\nThe *Dao* gives birth to the One,\nAnd the world has a beginning—\nIt is the mother of the world.\nThe One gives birth to the Two,\nAnd thus the ancient beginning is known.\nThe Two gives birth to the Three,\nAnd the *Dao* gives birth to them.\nThe Three gives birth to all things,\nAnd all things attain life by the One.\nAll things carry *yin* (阴) yet embrace *yang* (阳),\nAnd the celestial gate opens and closes.\nThe *qi* (氣) mingles to form harmony.\nFocus the *qi* to attain softness.\nWhat people detest\nAre *lonely* (孤), *widowed* (寡), *unworthy* (不毂),\nYet kings and nobles take them as their titles.\nGreat achievement seems like a lack.\nThus, things may be diminished yet gain,\nOr increased yet diminish—\nThey follow one another.\nWhat people teach,\nI also teach—\nThe *Dao* is the same as the *Dao*.\nThe strong and violent do not meet their end,\nThe stubborn and rigid are doomed to die.\nI will use this as my teaching model,\nSo that the wise will not dare to act thus.\n\n**Chapter 43: The Chapter of Partial Use**\n\nThe world’s most supple\nOvercomes the world’s most rigid.\nNo substance is softer than water,\nYet in overcoming the rigid and strong,\nNone can surpass it.\nIt enters where there is no space.\nThe *Having* and *Non-Having* give birth to each other.\nThus, I know the benefit of *Non-Action* (无为).\nTherefore, the Sage dwells in *Non-Action*.\nSilent teaching, benefit through *Non-Action*—\nFew in the world can attain it.\nThose who know me are rare,\nThose who follow me are honored.\n\n**Chapter 44: The Chapter of Establishing Precepts**\n\nWhat is closer to one’s name: one’s person or reputation?\nOne cannot grasp it to make close.\nWhat is more abundant: one’s person or wealth?\nOne cannot seize it to make beneficial.\nWhat brings greater harm: gain or loss?\nTo observe oneself with one’s person—\nThus, excessive love brings great expenditure,\nAnd action leads to ruin.\nExcessive hoarding brings great loss,\nAnd grasping leads to loss.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no shame,\nNo disaster greater than not knowing sufficiency.\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril,\nAnd one may endure long.\nKnowing this is why one does not perish.\n\n**Chapter 45: The Chapter of Great *Virtue* (德)**\n\nGreat achievement seems like a lack,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nThe highest *virtue* is not virtuous,\nAnd thus it has *virtue*.\nThe greatest fullness seems like emptiness,\nYet its use is unending.\nThe *Dao* is empty yet used.\nThe greatest rectitude seems like bending,\nAnd bending brings completeness.\nGreat skill seems like clumsiness,\nGreat purity seems like shame,\nGreat eloquence seems like inarticulateness,\nThe wise do not speak.\nThe *Dao*’s *qi* (氣) overcomes cold,\nStillness overcomes heat—\n*Non-Action* (无为) yet nothing remains ungoverned.\nClarity and purity establish order for the world.\nIf one does not desire stillness,\nThe world will self-correct.\nIf one does not desire frugality,\nThe world will self-correct.\n\n**Chapter 46: The Chapter of Rejecting Desires**\n\nWhen the world follows the *Dao*,\nHorses are turned back to manure.\nHe who aids the sovereign with the *Dao*\nDoes not use arms to conquer the world.\nWhen the world does not follow the *Dao*,\nWarhorses arise in the suburbs.\nWhere the armies encamp,\nThorns and brambles grow.\nNo guilt is greater than desiring what one should not,\nAnd excessive love brings great expenditure.\n\n「Misfortune knows no greater cause than failing to know sufficiency—\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril.\nNo fault surpasses the greed of acquisition.\nWhat is gained and what is lost—\nWhich brings greater harm?\nThus, he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.\nHe who knows sufficiency is rich.\n\n**Chapter 47: The Chapter of Discerning the Distant**\n\nWithout stepping beyond the door, one knows the world.\nWithout traveling, one knows the way.\nWithout peering through windows, one sees the *Dao*.\nSubtle, mysterious, and far-reaching—\nThe farther one goes, the less one truly knows.\nExcess leads to confusion.\nTherefore, the Sage acts without traveling yet knows all,\nIlluminated in every direction.\nUnseen, yet named;\nWithout action, yet accomplished.\nWhen deeds are done and affairs fulfilled,\nThe people say, *\"It was as if by nature.\"*\n\n**Chapter 48: The Chapter of Forgetting Knowledge**\n\nIn learning, one gains daily,\nYet the more one knows, the less one comprehends.\nIn the *Dao*, one diminishes daily—\nThe wise do not seek breadth.\nSubtract again, subtract once more,\nUntil one reaches *Non-Action*.\nExtreme emptiness attained,\n*Non-Action* yet nothing remains undone.\nTo govern the world, one must act with *Non-Action*.\nTo rule with virtue, one must act with *Non-Action*.\nWhen affairs arise, *Non-Action* is insufficient to govern the world.\nIn a disordered state, loyal ministers emerge.\n\n**Chapter 49: The Chapter of Trusting in Virtue**\n\nThe Sage has no fixed heart—\nHe takes the people’s heart as his own.\nWith virtue as his measure,\nHe who is good, I make good;\nHe who is not good, I also make good—virtue is good.\nAll know goodness as goodness.\nHe who is trustworthy, I trust;\nHe who is untrustworthy, I also trust—virtue is trust.\nAll know beauty as beauty.\nThe Sage, dwelling in the world,\nWith reverence, blends his heart with the world—\nThe *Dao* flows vast.\nThe people fix their ears and eyes,\nThe common folk shine brightly.\nThe Sage treats them as children.\nHis virtue is profound, like that of an infant.\nHe cherishes life.\n\n**Chapter 50: The Chapter of Valuing Life**\n\nBirth and death, good and evil—\nThe ways of life are thirteenfold, the gentle and weak among them.\nThe ways of death are thirteenfold, the firm and strong among them.\nOf the people, those who live\nMove into death’s domain—thirteenfold as well.\nHe who does not cling to life is wiser than he who values it.\nWhy so?\nBecause his life is deeply nurtured.\nThe people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive clinging to life—\nThus, they lightly court death.\nIt is said that those skilled in preserving life\nWalk on land without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,\nTheir virtue profound.\nThey enter battle without armor or weapons—»\n\n「The blades of weapons find no place to strike.\nRhinoceroses have no place to thrust their horns,\nSnatching birds do not attack.\nTigers have no place to extend their claws,\nFierce beasts do not seize.\nThe blades of weapons find no place to strike—\nHeaven will rescue them,\nEnfolding them with its **慈 (cī, benevolent mercy)**.\nWhy so?\nBecause there is no place where they may die.\nHeaven’s Dao has no favorites,\nAlways aligning with those of **德 (virtue/power)**.\n**Chapter 51: The Chapter of Nurturing Virtue**\n\nThe Dao gives birth to them,\nVirtue sustains them.\nAll things receive **一 (the One, fundamental essence)** to live.\nForm shapes them,\nCircumstance perfects them.\nThere is a primal substance, **混成 (hùnchéng, indistinctly formed)**,\nThus, all things cannot but revere the Dao and hold virtue dear.\nThe Dao is the profound mystery of all things.\nThe reverence of the Dao,\nThe esteem of virtue—\nNone command them yet they persist naturally.\nThe Dao follows **自然 (zìrán, self-so).\nThus, the Dao gives birth to them,\nVirtue sustains them.\nHolding fast to the ancient Dao,\nIt nurtures and fosters them,\nGives birth and sustains them.\nIt matures and perfects them,\nThe Dao gives birth to them.\nIt nourishes and shelters them,\nWith its aid, all things fulfill their natural course.\nBorn yet not possessed,\nActing yet not controlling,\nGrowing yet not reaping—\nThis is called **玄德 (Xuándé, profound virtue/power)**.\nHeaven’s Dao is beneficial yet not harmful.\n\n**Chapter 52: The Chapter of Returning to the Root**\n\nThe world has its beginning,\nWhich becomes the **母 (mother)** of the world.\nThere is a name for the **母 (mother)** of all things.\nOnce the mother is known,\nHer offspring can be understood.\nTo know the ancient beginning—\nOnce the offspring are known,\nReturn and hold fast to the mother.\nEach returns to its root,\nAnd its life is never endangered.\nHeaven endures, Earth persists.\nSeal its **兑 (duì, mouth/opening)**,\nClose its **门 (gates)**,\nSee no **可欲 (kěyù, desirable things)**,\nAnd labor never ceases.\nIf lost, if hidden—\nOpen its **兑 (mouth/opening)**,\nAccomplish its work,\nThe common folk scrutinize and probe,\nYet their lives are never saved.\nNot the Dao’s fault, but their own.\nSeeing the small as **明 (bright/clear)**,\nThe subtle and mysterious as **通 (passing through)**,\nHolding to the gentle as **强 (strong)**,\nThe utmost harmony.\nUsing its **光 (radiance)**,\nReturning to its **明 (brightness/essence)**—\nIts use is never exhausted.\nNo harm befalls the body,\nThis is called **袭常 (xícháng, following constancy)**.\nWith this, one may have a nation.\n\n**Chapter 53: The Chapter of Further Proof**」\n\nWhen I am clear and knowing,\nWalking the Great Dao,\nMy words are most easy to know,\nMost easy to practice.\nYet people fear to apply them.\n\nNone under Heaven can know them,\nNone can practice them.\nThe Great Dao is most smooth,\nYet people love shortcuts.\n\nTruthful words are not ornate.\nMorning’s simplicity is most pure,\nYet great love brings great expense.\nFields grow overgrown,\nGranaries lie empty,\nWhere armies march, thorns and brambles rise.\n\nFine silks and embroidery—\nThe adornment of the Dao,\nYet the beginning of folly.\nWearing sharp swords—\nFine weapons are ominous instruments.\n\nOverindulging in food,\nFive flavors dull the palate.\nExcess wealth—\nThis is called thieving and boasting,\nNot the Dao’s way.\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.\n\n**Chapter 54: The Chapter of Cultivation and Observation**\n\nThose who build well cannot be uprooted,\nStanding firm and unchanging.\nThose who embrace well do not slip,\nHolding One, they cannot depart.\nTheir descendants’ sacrifices never cease—\nThe Way of long life and clear vision.\n\nCultivate it in the body,\nIts virtue becomes true.\nThe Dao gives birth to it.\nCultivate it in the family,\nIts virtue overflows—\nRich in contained virtue.\nCultivate it in the village,\nIts virtue grows—\nVirtue stored within.\nCultivate it in the state,\nIts virtue flourishes.\nLords and kings who hold One\nSet the world aright.\nCultivate it in the world,\nIts virtue becomes universal.\nThe Great Dao is vast.\n\nThus, observing the body with the body,\nWhich is dearer—name or self?\nObserving the family with the family,\nEven with filial piety,\nSix kinsmen may not harmonize.\nObserving the village with the village,\nGood and evil are revealed.\nObserving the state with the state,\nEven with loyal ministers,\nThe nation may be in chaos.\nObserving the world with the world—\nTherefore, those who value the self as the world\nMay entrust themselves to the world,\nThose who love the self as the world\nMay commit themselves to the world.\n\nHow do I know the world is so?\nBy this.\n\n---\n\nThus, the sage acts without doing yet knows.\n\n**Chapter 55: The Mysterious Symbol**\nThe depth of virtue is like that of an infant.\nConcentrating the *qi* to achieve supreme softness, one becomes like a babe.\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not clutch,\nSnatching birds do not seize.\nTherefore, those who follow the Dao are unassailable.\nThough bones are weak and sinews soft, their grip is firm.\nEmpty their heart, fill their belly.\nUnknowing of the union of male and female yet their essence flows freely—this is the utmost refinement.\nThus, they merge into oneness.\nCry all day without hoarseness—this is the utmost harmony.\nThe Dao is boundless yet applied with precision.\nKnowing harmony is constancy,\nKnowing constancy is clarity—\nThis is called aligning with Heaven, the ancient ultimate.\n\nTo nurture life is auspicious,\nYet benefit comes from non-action.\nWhen the heart commands the *qi*, it is strength.\nStrengthening the bones,\nThings grow robust yet age swiftly—\nThis is called *not* the Dao,\nAnd the Dao *not* followed will perish early.\nThus, those who are rigidly strong are doomed to death.\n\n**Chapter 56: The Mysterious Virtue**\nThe wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\nRare speech is natural.\nSeal the senses,\nClose the gates,\nDo not see what is desirable.\nDull the sharpness,\nUntangle the confusion—\nOnly by not contending does one avoid blame.\nBlend their light with the dust,\nShine without dazzling—\nThis is called the Mysterious Unity.\nHold fast to the ancient Dao,\nThus, it cannot be grasped as near nor rejected as distant.\nDesire not-desire,\nDo not prize difficult-to-obtain wealth.\nCannot be gained for profit nor lost for harm.\nGive birth yet do not possess,\nAct yet do not rely.\nCannot be prized nor debased—\nSelf-love without self-aggrandizement.\nThus, they are prized by the world.\nThose who know me are rare,\nThose who love me are precious.\n\n**Chapter 57: Pure Transformation**\nGovern with uprightness, not with cleverness—this is the nation’s blessing.\nUse the unusual in warfare, govern with cleverness—this is the nation’s ruin.\nTo take the world by doing nothing,\nThe world is always taken by doing nothing.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\nObserving the nation with the nation.\nThe world abounds with taboos,\nYet the people grow ever poorer.\nThe people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation.\nThe people have many sharp tools,\nYet the state grows ever more chaotic.\nHard-to-obtain wealth makes men act deceitfully.\nThe people abound in cunning,\nYet strange things arise.\nWisdom emerges,\nAnd great falsehoods proliferate.\nLaws and decrees become more explicit,\nAnd thieves and robbers multiply.\nThe world abounds with taboos,\nYet the people grow ever poorer.\nTherefore, the sage says:\nI act without doing, yet the people transform themselves.\nHold the great pattern,\nAnd the world will come of its own accord.\nI have no affairs, yet the people grow rich.\nLove the people, govern the state—\nOne can act without doing.\nI favor tranquility, yet the people align themselves.\nAct without acting,\nAnd nothing remains ungoverned.\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.\nThe nameless simplicity,\nEven this shall not be desired.\n\n**Chapter 58: Following the Transformation**\nWhen governance is dim and indistinct,\nThe people are sincere and earnest.\nGovern with uprightness,\nAnd governance is dim and indistinct.\nWhen governance is scrutinizing and strict,\nThe people are frail and depleted.\nLaws and decrees become more explicit,\nAnd thieves and robbers multiply.\nCalamity, where fortune leans,\nMay be lost to gain.\nFortune, where calamity lurks,\nMay be gained to lose.\nWho knows its ultimate?\nNo one knows its ultimate.\nIts rectitude and deviation are not fixed,\nNor is it because of its lack of partiality.\nRectitude becomes the unusual,\nGoodness becomes the bizarre.\nThe Great Dao is most even,\nYet the people prefer narrow paths.\nThe people’s delusion has lasted long indeed.\nThe multitude bustles and rejoices,\nAs if feasting on a grand sacrifice.\nThus, the sage is square yet not rigid,\nModest yet not harmful,\nLong yet not domineering,\nStraight yet not overbearing,\nBright yet not dazzling—\nThe depth of their virtue.\n\n**Chapter 59: Guarding the Dao**\nTo govern men and serve Heaven,\nNothing surpasses frugality.\nThose who preserve this Dao,\nFrugality is indeed called returning to the root.\nEach returns to its root—\nReturning to the root is called accumulating virtue early.\nThe Mysterious Virtue runs deep.\nAccumulating virtue early,\nNothing it cannot overcome.\nIts application is inexhaustible.\nIts application is inexhaustible,\nNothing it cannot overcome—\nNo one knows its ultimate.\nIts use cannot be fully realized.\nNo one knows its ultimate,\nYet one can have a state.\nThus, they can live long.\nThe mother of a state can endure long,\nThe Dao endures long—\nThis is called the Dao of deep roots and firm stems,\nOf long life and enduring vision.\n\n**Chapter 60: The Enduring Dao**\n\n**Chapter 61: The Dao of the Great and the Small**\nTo govern a great state as one would cook a small fish—\nIts approach is gentle, its people content.\nTo rule the world with the Dao,\nIts spirits are not dreaded.\nThe highest virtue does not claim virtue.\nNot because its spirits are not dreaded,\nBut by harmonizing its brilliance.\nIts brilliance does not harm people.\nTo love the people and govern the state—\nNot because its brilliance does not harm people,\nBut by not daring to seize strength.\nThe Sage also does not harm people.\nI do nothing, yet the people transform themselves.\nWhen both do not harm each other,\nTheir virtues naturally intertwine.\nTo grasp the Great Image,\nThe world will turn toward you.\nThe Sage who acts with humility—\nThis is the chapter on the virtue of humility.\n\nThe great state flows downward,\nThe great should naturally be low.\nThe world’s confluence—\nHollow, it fills.\nThe world’s receptive—\nThe receptive always overcomes the aggressive.\nKnow its aggression,\nHold to its receptivity.\nTo be low is to be still.\nBy its goodness in flowing downward,\nIt can become the sovereign of all things.\nThus, the great state submits to the small,\nAnd takes the small.\nNot boasting, it endures long.\nThe small state submits to the great,\nAnd is taken by the great.\nTo bend is to remain whole.\nSometimes one submits to take,\nAnd victory belongs to those who do.\nSometimes one submits and takes.\nThe Dao follows nature.\nThe great state does not seek to devour others,\nBut to nurture all things without claiming lordship.\nThe small state does not seek to serve others,\nBut to serve well what it can.\nThese two fulfill their own desires.\nTheir approach is one in harmony.\nThe great should naturally be low.\nThose who excel in using others should be low.\nThis is the chapter on the Dao of the Way.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao’s Hidden Depth**\nThe Dao is the hidden essence of all things,\nAll things honor the Dao and value virtue.\nThe treasure of the good person—\nHeaven gains the One and remains clear.\nThe refuge of the unworthy—\nThe Dao gives life, virtue sustains it.\nFine words can be sold,\nYet the Sage does not hoard them.\nThe more he gives to others, the more he possesses.\nNoble deeds can be bestowed upon people,\nEver aiding them in goodness.\nThe Sage’s constant practice is to rescue people.\nWhy should the unworthy be abandoned?\nThus, the good person is the teacher of the unworthy.\nTherefore, the Sage establishes the Son of Heaven\nAnd appoints the Three Exalted Ministers—\nThis is the way of the Sage.\nThough one has a jade tablet to precede four horses,\nIt is not as good as sitting and advancing this Dao.\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao.\nThe ancients prized this Dao because it was profound—\nProfound yet more profound.\nWhy must one daily seek to obtain it,\nOr use guilt to avoid evil?\nKnowing this, one will not falter.\nThus, it is prized above all by the world.\nThe Dao’s exalted worth—\nThis is the chapter on the beginning of grace.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 63: The Dao of Non-Action**\nTo act without action,\nThe benefits of non-action—\nFew in the world can attain them.\nTo manage without managing,\nI manage nothing, yet the people grow rich.\nTo taste without savoring,\nThe Dao’s emergence is as plain as water.\nGreat or small, many or few,\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nVirtue sustains them.\nTo attempt the difficult in its ease,\nMany easy things will lead to difficulty.\nTo achieve the great in its smallness,\nA tree thick enough to embrace—\nIt grows from a tiny sprout.\nThe world’s great difficulties must arise from the small.\nThe difficult and the easy form each other.\nThe world’s great undertakings must arise from the minute.\nIf I were to know this clearly,\nAnd walk the Great Dao,\nThen the Sage would never claim to be great,\nYet could accomplish the great.\nNot boasting, it endures long.\nLight promises will surely lack trust,\nNot knowing what is known as illness.\nMany easy things will lead to difficulty—\nFine words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to act upon,\nYet the world cannot know them,\nCannot act upon them.\nThus, the Sage finds them difficult.\nHence, he will never face difficulty.\nThe world’s great difficulties must arise from the ease.\nThis is the chapter on guarding subtlety.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 64: The Dao of Simplicity**\nIts tranquility is easy to maintain,\nSerenity is the highest state.\nIts signs are easy to discern before they appear,\nAct upon them before they exist.\nIts fragility is easy to break,\nFirmness and strength are the doom of things.\nIts subtlety is easy to disperse.\nTo practice the Dao is to daily diminish.\nAct upon them before they exist,\nGovern before they are disordered.\nThus, the Sage acts below and knows above.\nA tree thick enough to embrace—\nIt grows from a tiny sprout.\nThe world’s great undertakings must arise from the small.\nA nine-tiered tower—\nIt begins with piled earth.\nHigh labor must be founded on the low.\nA thousand-li journey—\nIt starts beneath one’s feet.\nTo achieve the great from the small.\nThose who act will ruin it,\nThose who grasp will lose it.\nIf one would take it away,\nOne must first firmly give it.\nThe Sage acts without acting,\nThus he never ruins;\nHe does not grasp,\nThus he never loses.\nTo act without acting.\nThe people’s undertakings—\nOften fail just as they near completion.\nThose who act will ruin it.\nTo be cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nThen there will be no ruined undertakings.\nTo guard is to be firm.\nThus, the Sage desires not to desire,\nDoes not prize hard-to-obtain goods.\nNot desiring what shines like jade,\nNot learning what is already learned—\nReturning to what others have passed over.\nDwelling in substance, not in its splendor,\nAiding the natural self-sufficiency of all things,\nDaring not to act.\nThe Dao is ever without action.\nThis is the chapter on pure virtue.\n\n「To cherish oneself is not to prize oneself.\nThus, the world delights in promoting him without being weary of it.\nAll know beauty when they see it—\nBecause he does not vie, none can vie with him.\nOnly he who does not vie\nIs free from blame.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven on the Three Treasures**\nThe world all says my Dao is great,\nYet appears unworthy.\nBrightness without brilliance—\nIf it shines like jade,\nIts refinement has long since faded.\nThe Dao is a thing\nOf vague and hazy form.\n\nI have three treasures:\nTreasure them and hold them fast.\nGive birth and do not possess,\nAct and do not rely upon,\nGrow and do not dominate.\nThe first is *cí* (慈, compassion/kindness),\nThe second is *jiǎn* (俭, frugality),\nThe third is *bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān* (不敢为天下先, daring not to lead the world).\n\nI have these three treasures:\nCompassion makes one brave,\nGuarding softness is strength.\nFrugality brings abundance,\nAbandoning extravagance.\nDaring not to lead the world,\nThus one can perfect the vessel and endure long.\n\nNot daring to advance an inch yet retreat a foot—\nNow abandon humility and take the lead,\nDeath awaits.\nThe obstinate will not know their end.\nCompassion in battle brings victory,\nSoftness overcomes hardness.\nTo hold fast is to be steadfast.\nThose who preserve this Dao—\nHeaven shall rescue them,\nWith compassion as their shield.\nHeaven’s Dao has no favorites,\nAlways aiding the virtuous.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight on Aligning with Heaven**\nThe virtuous scholar is not martial,\nAssisting the ruler with the Dao,\nNot relying on arms to subdue the world.\nThe skilled warrior does not rage,\nSoftness overcomes strength.\nThe wise victor does not vie,\nYielding preserves wholeness.\nThe good leader serves below,\nGreatness lies in serving below.\nThis is called the virtue of non-vying,\nWeakening one’s resolve.\nThis is called the strength of using others,\nKnowing people is wisdom.\nThis is called aligning with Heaven,\nThe ancient ultimate.\nHolding fast to the ancient Dao,\nMysterious and effective.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Nine on Employing the Mysterious**\nThere are words on wielding arms:\nThus, those who establish them have been.\nI dare not be host but guest,\nKnowing honor and guarding disgrace.\nNot daring to advance an inch yet retreat a foot—\nAbandoning humility and taking the lead,\nDeath awaits.\nThis is called *no action yet action* (行无行),\n*no arms yet arms* (攘无臂),\n*no enemies yet enemies* (仍无敌),\n*no weapons yet weapons* (执无兵).\nThus, the good are merely fruitful.\nNo greater calamity than scornful of the enemy,\nLife or name—what is more dear?\nScornful of the enemy nearly loses my treasures.\nNo greater fault than desiring gain.\nThus, when armies clash,\nThe sorrowful shall prevail.\nHence, arms strong yet not victorious.\nKnowing difficulty,\n\n**Chapter Seventy on Ignorance**\nMy words are easy to know,\nEasy to act upon.\nThe Great Dao is smooth and simple.\nYet the world cannot know it,\nCannot act upon it.\nThe people are bewildered.\n\nWords have their root,\nAffairs have their master.\nThe *Tàishàng* (太上, Supreme Sage) knows these.\nOnly because of ignorance\nDo they not know me.\nSelf-knowing yet not self-displaying—\nFew know me,\nMany know me and are confused.\nThose who truly know me are honored.\nThe Dao’s reverence.\nThus, the Sage wears coarse robes yet harbors jade.\nBrightness without brilliance—\nIf it shines like jade,\nIts refinement has long since faded.\nKnowing sickness,\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One on Knowing Sickness**\nKnowing the unknown is superior,\nNot self-displaying is clarity.\nNot knowing yet knowing is sickness.\nSelf-displaying is not clarity.\nOnly because of knowing sickness,\nThus one is not sick.\nAdvancing the Dao is like retreating.\nThe Sage is not sick,\nBecause he knows sickness,\nThus he is not sick.\nGreat virtue seems insufficient.»\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two on Loving Oneself**\nThe people do not fear great threats,\nWhen great threats arrive.\nNot knowing constancy,\nRecklessly creating calamity.\nDo not narrow their dwelling,\nEmpty their hearts.\nDo not weary of what they produce,\nCirculate freely without peril.\nOnly because of not wearying,\nThus one is not weary.\nThe good at embracing do not fall away.\nThus, the Sage knows himself yet does not display,\nSmooths the Dao like common clay.\nCherishes himself yet does not prize himself.\nHighest virtue is not virtue.\nHence, abandon that and take this,\nOpposite to nature.\nTasking the world,\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Three on Tasking the World**\nBrave yet daring brings death,\nThe obstinate are doomed.\nBrave yet not daring brings life,\nThe gentle endure.\nThese two—\nOne benefits, one harms.\nGood and evil.\nWhat Heaven abhors,\nWho knows its cause?\n\nThere are always those who wield death.\nThus, the Sage fears it still.\nOnly the *shī* (施, benevolent) are to be feared.\nHeaven’s Dao,\nDoes not vie yet prevails,\nFollows nature.\nDoes not speak yet responds well,\nSilent yet natural.\nDoes not summon yet comes,\nActs opportunely.\nQuiet yet well-plotted,\nAffairs well-executed.\nHeaven’s net vast and wide,\nLoose yet never misses.\nWhat Heaven abhors,\nWho knows its cause?\n**Chapter Seventy-Four on Restraining Confusion**\nThe people do not fear death,\nHow can one frighten them with death?\nThe people do not fear great threats,\nWhen great threats arrive.\nIf one makes the people always fear death,\nThen even the wise will not dare act.\nYet those who act strangely,\nInvite their own blame.\nI grasp them and kill them—\nWho dares?\nBrave yet daring brings death.\nThere are always those who wield death.\nRuling the world with the Dao—\nTo wield death in place of Heaven’s decree,\nIs like a substitute carpenter taking the master’s axe.\nNot knowing yet knowing is sickness.\nTo wield death in place of Heaven’s decree,\nFew do not injure their hands.\nTheir affairs return to them.\n**Chapter Seventy-Five on Greed and Loss**\n...\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Six on Overbearing Constraints**\nThe people’s hunger comes from their rulers exacting too many taxes.\nThus, the more taboos and prohibitions there are, the poorer the people become.\nThe people are hard to govern because their rulers act too much.\nThe more laws and edicts are proclaimed, the more thieves and bandits there are.\nThe people treat death lightly because their desire for life is so great.\nWhen the people’s craving for life leads them into perilous paths,\nOnly those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who value it.\nThe Dao is ever without action.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven on Heaven’s Way**\nHeaven’s Way—is it not like drawing a bow?\nThe ancients who excelled in the Dao\nsuppressed the high and raised the low,\nused the Way’s emptiness to act.\nTo those with excess, they took away;\nto those lacking, they gave.\nThus, taking away benefits them,\nand giving benefits them as well.\nHeaven’s Way is to reduce excess and supplement deficiency.\nEmpty their minds, fill their bellies.\nHuman ways are not so.\nThey give to those lacking to serve those who have.\nThose who lose are the same as those who gain.\nWho can gain excess to serve the world?\nOnly those who follow the Dao.\n\nThe Sage does not hoard,\nyet the more they give, the more they have.\nThus, the Sage acts yet does not rely on it.\nHeaven and Earth are not kind;\nthey treat all things as fodder for the sacrificial altar.\nWhen the work is done yet no credit is taken,\nthis is the Sage’s humility.\nGreat completion seems like a flaw.\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight on Trusting in Faith**\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven on Water’s Way**\nThe world has nothing softer nor weaker than water,\nyet nothing better for the Dao than water.\nYet in overcoming hardness and strength,\nnone know its power to prevail.\nSoftness overcomes hardness—\nthere is nothing to replace it.\nThe world has nothing softer nor weaker than water,\nthus softness overcomes hardness,\nweakness overcomes strength,\nand softness-weakness overcomes hardness-strength.\nYet none can know it,\nnone can act in accordance with it.\nCan one truly not know it?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine on Trusting in Virtue**\n\nThus the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the filth of the state—*\nthis is called the Lord of the Soil and Grain.\n*To know the constant and embrace it,*\nthis is called the public Virtue.\n*To bear the misfortunes of the state—*\nthis is to be the King of the World.\n*To dwell where the multitude abhors,*\nthus one approaches the Dao.\n*Straight speech seems like perversion.*\n\nThe mysterious Virtue is profound and distant,\nyet it opposes all things.\n**Chapter Eighty on the Way of the Daoist**\n\n*To reconcile great grudges,*\nthere must remain some grudge—\nhow can this be called good?\n*Great and small, many and few,*\nrepay grudges with Virtue.\nThus the Sage holds the left contract,\nyet does not blame others.\n\nThe Sage is not kind,\nfor he treats the people as fodder for the sacrificial altar.\nThus one with Virtue governs contracts,\nwhile the Daoist aligns with the Dao.\nWithout Virtue, one cannot penetrate,\nfor the Dao is ever without action.\n\nThe Way of Heaven has no favorites,\nyet it always sides with the Virtuous.\nThe Virtuous, I Virtue them.\n**Chapter Eighty-One on Simplicity and Authenticity**\n\nFaithful words are not ornate,\nornate words are not faithful.\nThe faithful, I believe them,\nyet I also believe the unfaithful.\n\nThe good do not argue,\nthe argumentative are not good.\nThe good, I Virtue them,\nyet I also Virtue the ungood.\n\nThe wise are not learned,\nthe learned are not wise.\nFew things bring clarity,\nmany things bring confusion.\nThe Sage does not hoard,\nyet the more he gives to others, the more he has.\nHe is always good at saving others.\nThe more he gives to things, the more he possesses.\nThe Way of Heaven benefits yet does not harm.\nThe Dao is honored.\nThe Sage’s Way acts yet does not contend.\nVirtue is precious.\n\n**End of the *Zhuangzi*’s

(谷), by the One, attains fullness,\nAnd the *Dao* gives birth to it.\nAll things, by the One, attain life,\nAnd *virtue* (德) nurtures them.\nLords and kings, by the One, establish order for the world.\nEmbrace the One to serve as a model for the world.\nThis is how the One is attained.\nThe *Dao* is the hidden mystery of all things.\nIf Heaven lacks clarity,\nIt will fear collapse,\nAnd the great *Dao* will be abandoned.\nIf Earth lacks tranquility,\nIt will fear upheaval,\nAnd the ancient ways will be unknown.\nIf the *Spirit* lacks responsiveness,\nIt will fear stagnation,\nAnd the *Dao* will already have vanished.\nIf the *Valley* lacks fullness,\nIt will fear exhaustion,\nAnd will bring ruin upon itself.\nIf all things lack the One to sustain them,\nThey will fear annihilation—\nThis is called *non-Dao*.\nIf lords and kings lack the One to ennoble them,\nThey will fear decline.\nIf they are rich and noble yet arrogant,\nThen nobility must take humility as its foundation,\nThe great must take the lowly as its base,\nThe high must take the lowly as its support.\nHe who best uses people is lowly.\nThus, lords and kings call themselves *lonely* (孤), *widowed* (寡), *unworthy* (不毂).\nThe *virtue* of the highest is not virtuous—\nIs this not taking humility as its foundation?\nThus, nobility must take humility as its foundation.\nIs this not so?\nHence, the fewest carriages are the most honored.\nShine without dazzling—\nDo not desire brilliance like jade,\nNor solidity like stone.\nIt cannot be seized to make noble,\nNor seized to make lowly.\n\n**Chapter 40: The Chapter of Returning**\n\nThe *Dao* moves by reversing,\nEach returning to its root.\nThe weak is the *Dao*’s use.\nFocus the *qi* (氣) to govern the soft.\nThe world’s myriad things arise from the *Having* (有),\nAnd the *Having* arises from the *Non-Having* (无).\nThe *Dao* gives birth to the One,\nThe One gives birth to the Two,\nThe Two gives birth to the Three,\nAnd the Three gives birth to all things.\n\n**Chapter 41: The Chapter of Similarity and Difference**\n\nThe superior man hears the *Dao* and strives to practice it.\nOf old, those who excelled in the *Dao*...\nThe middle man hears the *Dao* and holds it as if it were something,\nAs if it were nothing—\nWho knows its limit?\nThe lowly man hears the *Dao* and laughs at it.\nIf he does not

dazzling.\nThe *Dao* is plain yet seems unlike others,\nKnowing its white yet guarding its black.\nAdvancing the *Dao* seems like retreat,\nGreat achievement seems like a lack.\nThe highest *virtue* seems like a *Valley*,\nEmptying the mind.\nThe greatest purity seems like shame,\nThe greatest rectitude seems like bending.\nGreat skill seems like clumsiness,\nGreat wisdom seems like folly.\nGreat eloquence seems like inarticulateness,\nThe wise do not speak.\nThe *Dao* is hidden and nameless,\nUnseen yet named.\nOnly the *Dao* is good at lending itself and completing its work.\nThe *Dao* is the hidden mystery of all things.\n\n**Chapter 42: The Chapter of *Dao* Transformation**\n\nThe *Dao* gives birth to the One,\nAnd the world has a beginning—\nIt is the mother of the world.\nThe One

detest\nAre *lonely* (孤), *widowed* (寡), *unworthy* (不毂),\nYet kings and nobles take them as their titles.\nGreat achievement seems like a lack.\nThus, things may be diminished yet gain,\nOr increased yet diminish—\nThey follow one another.\nWhat people teach,\nI also teach—\nThe *Dao* is the same as the *Dao*.\nThe strong and violent do not meet their end,\nThe stubborn and rigid are doomed to die.\nI will use this as my teaching model,\nSo that the wise will not dare to act thus.\n\n**Chapter 43: The Chapter of Partial Use**\n\nThe world’s most supple\nOvercomes the world’s most rigid.\nNo substance is softer than water,\nYet in overcoming the rigid and strong,\nNone can surpass it.\nIt enters where there is no space.\nThe *Having* and *Non-Having* give birth to each other.\nThus, I

abundant: one’s person or wealth?\nOne cannot seize it to make beneficial.\nWhat brings greater harm: gain or loss?\nTo observe oneself with one’s person—\nThus, excessive love brings great expenditure,\nAnd action leads to ruin.\nExcessive hoarding brings great loss,\nAnd grasping leads to loss.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no shame,\nNo disaster greater than not knowing sufficiency.\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril,\nAnd one may endure long.\nKnowing this is why one does not perish.\n\n**Chapter 45: The Chapter of Great *Virtue* (德)**\n\nGreat achievement seems like a lack,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nThe highest *virtue* is not virtuous,\nAnd thus it has *virtue*.\nThe greatest fullness seems like emptiness,\nYet its use is unending.\nThe *Dao* is empty yet used.\nThe greatest rectitude seems like bending,\nAnd bending brings completeness.\nGreat skill seems like clumsiness,\nGreat purity seems like shame,\nGreat eloquence seems like inarticulateness,\nThe wise do not speak.\nThe *Dao*’s *qi* (氣) overcomes cold,\nStillness overcomes heat—\n*Non-Action* (无为) yet nothing remains ungoverned.\nClarity and purity establish order for the world.\nIf one does not desire stillness,\nThe world will self-correct.\nIf one does not desire frugality,\nThe world will self-correct.\n\n**Chapter 46: The Chapter of Rejecting Desires**\n\nWhen

appear,\nAct upon them before they exist.\nIts fragility is easy to break,\nFirmness and strength are the doom of things.\nIts subtlety is easy to disperse.\nTo practice the Dao is to daily diminish.\nAct upon them before they exist,\nGovern before they are disordered.\nThus, the Sage acts below and knows above.\nA tree thick enough to embrace—\nIt grows from a tiny sprout.\nThe world’s great undertakings must arise from the small.\nA nine-tiered tower—\nIt begins with piled earth.\nHigh labor must be founded on the low.\nA thousand-li journey—\nIt starts beneath one’s feet.\nTo

without brilliance—\nIf it shines like jade,\nIts refinement has long since faded.\nThe Dao is a thing\nOf vague and hazy form.\n\nI have three treasures:\nTreasure them and hold them fast.\nGive birth and do not possess,\nAct and do not rely upon,\nGrow and do not dominate.\nThe first is *cí* (慈, compassion/kindness),\nThe second is *jiǎn* (俭, frugality),\nThe third is *bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān* (不敢为天下先, daring not to lead the world).\n\nI have these three treasures:\nCompassion makes one brave,\nGuarding softness is strength.\nFrugality brings abundance,\nAbandoning extravagance.\nDaring not to lead the world,\nThus one can perfect the vessel and endure long.\n\nNot daring to advance an inch yet retreat a foot—\nNow abandon humility and take the lead,\nDeath

them,\nWith compassion as their shield.\nHeaven’s Dao has no favorites,\nAlways aiding the virtuous.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight on Aligning with Heaven**\nThe virtuous scholar is not martial,\nAssisting the ruler with the Dao,\nNot relying on arms to subdue the world.\nThe skilled warrior does not rage,\nSoftness overcomes strength.\nThe wise victor does not vie,\nYielding preserves wholeness.\nThe good leader serves below,\nGreatness lies in serving below.\nThis is called the virtue of non-vying,\nWeakening one’s resolve.\nThis is called the strength of using others,\nKnowing people is wisdom.\nThis is called aligning with Heaven,\nThe ancient ultimate.\nHolding fast to the ancient Dao,\nMysterious and effective.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Nine on Employing the Mysterious**\nThere are words on wielding arms:\nThus, those who establish them have been.\nI dare not be host but guest,\nKnowing honor and guarding disgrace.\nNot daring to advance an inch yet retreat a foot—\nAbandoning humility and taking the lead,\nDeath awaits.\nThis is called *no action yet action* (行无行),\n*no arms yet arms* (攘无臂),\n*no enemies yet enemies* (仍无敌),\n*no weapons yet weapons* (执无兵).\nThus, the good are merely fruitful.\nNo greater calamity than scornful of the enemy,\nLife or name—what is more dear?\nScornful of the enemy nearly loses my treasures.\nNo greater fault than desiring gain.\nThus, when armies clash,\nThe sorrowful shall prevail.\nHence, arms strong yet not victorious.\nKnowing difficulty,\n\n**Chapter Seventy on Ignorance**\nMy words are easy to know,\nEasy to act upon.\nThe Great Dao is smooth and simple.\nYet the world cannot know it,\nCannot act upon it.\nThe people are bewildered.\n\nWords have their root,\nAffairs have their master.\nThe *Tàishàng* (太上, Supreme Sage) knows these.\nOnly because of ignorance\nDo they not know me.\nSelf-knowing yet not self-displaying—\nFew know me,\nMany know me and are confused.\nThose who truly know me are honored.\nThe Dao’s reverence.\nThus, the Sage wears coarse robes yet harbors jade.\nBrightness without brilliance—\nIf it shines like jade,\nIts refinement has long since faded.\nKnowing sickness,\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One on Knowing Sickness**\nKnowing the unknown is superior,\nNot self-displaying is clarity.\nNot knowing yet knowing is sickness.\nSelf-displaying is not clarity.\nOnly because of knowing sickness,\nThus one is not sick.\nAdvancing the Dao is like retreating.\nThe Sage is not sick,\nBecause he knows sickness,\nThus he is not sick.\nGreat virtue seems insufficient.»\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two on Loving Oneself**\nThe people do not fear great threats,\nWhen great threats arrive.\nNot knowing constancy,\nRecklessly creating calamity.\nDo not narrow their dwelling,\nEmpty their hearts.\nDo not weary of what they produce,\nCirculate freely without peril.\nOnly because of not wearying,\nThus one is not weary.\nThe good at embracing do not fall away.\nThus, the Sage knows himself yet does not display,\nSmooths the Dao like common clay.\nCherishes himself yet does not prize himself.\nHighest virtue is not virtue.\nHence, abandon that and take this,\nOpposite to nature.\nTasking the world,\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Three on Tasking the World**\nBrave yet daring brings death,\nThe obstinate are doomed.\nBrave yet not daring brings life,\nThe gentle endure.\nThese two—\nOne benefits, one harms.\nGood and evil.\nWhat Heaven abhors,\nWho knows its cause?\n\nThere are always those who wield death.\nThus, the Sage fears it still.\nOnly the *shī* (施, benevolent) are to be feared.\nHeaven’s Dao,\nDoes not vie yet prevails,\nFollows nature.\nDoes not speak yet responds well,\nSilent yet natural.\nDoes not summon yet comes,\nActs opportunely.\nQuiet yet well-plotted,\nAffairs well-executed.\nHeaven’s net vast and wide,\nLoose yet never misses.\nWhat Heaven abhors,\nWho knows its cause?\n**Chapter Seventy-Four on Restraining Confusion**\nThe people do
