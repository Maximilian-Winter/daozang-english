  "full_translation": "**The Red Pine Master’s Petition Rituals**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *The Red Pine Master’s Petition Rituals*. Author unknown; according to scholarly consensus, compiled by Tang-dynasty Daoist priests. A manual of early Celestial Master Daoist petition rituals. Six juan in total. Base text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongxuan* section, *Petition Memorials* category.\n\n**The Red Pine Master’s Petition Rituals, Juan One**\n\nRespectfully following *The Supreme Perfection Regulations* and *The Red Pine Master’s Records*: In the Han dynasty, humans and spirits intermingled, and malevolent forces spread unchecked. The Most High, moved by compassion, descended upon Mount Heming and bestowed upon Heavenly Master Zhang the *Orthodox Unity Alliance Registers* of one hundred twenty ranks, along with one thousand two hundred official protocols, three hundred major petitions, and esoteric ritual texts—all to succor and heal the living.\n\nThe Heavenly Master then established twenty-four dioceses, disseminating the *Orthodox Unity* petitions and talismans, registering households, and transforming the people while widely practicing hidden virtue. Yet as the ages passed, the precious petitions were lost, and what remains today is but one or two parts in ten.\n\nFurther, according to the record: Red Pine Master asked Heavenly Elder Pingchang, “Why has the petition submitted on the *jichou* day gone unreported?” Pingchang replied, “I saw the petition-bearer arrive at the Heavenly Gate, but the gate was closed.” The Master asked again, “When does it open and close in the span of a day and night?” Pingchang answered in full, precisely as the ritual codes prescribe.\n\nMoreover, when people submit petitions, their purposes vary—some for the state and household, others for themselves, their kin, or deceased ancestors. Each case differs and must be distinguished accordingly.\n\nIt is also said: The lifespan and fate of every person are governed by stellar constellations. If one commits evil deeds, their name is recorded in the Black Register, causing their spirit to grow restless, their dreams troubled, their path beset by misfortune, and their years diminished. But for those of pure heart who revere the Dao and its methods, seeking petitions and talismans, their transgressions are erased, blessings arise, their emoluments and longevity increase, their ancestors ascend, and their wishes are fulfilled.\n\nAll petitions must first be accompanied by offerings, so that the divine luminaries may witness one’s sincerity. Without offerings, the gods will not accept them, and one will be rebuked for stinginess and reluctance to give.\n\nIt is further said: The offerings for petitions are not fixed—those of wealth may increase them, while the poor may reduce them. Yet even among high officials and affluent households, if they covet merit but begrudge their wealth, mimicking the poor in their offerings, such conduct will yield no benefit.\n\nThe codes state: For those who are destitute and impoverished, seeking petitions and jiao rituals, the master may provide the ritual offerings on their behalf.\n\nThough old petitions vary in purpose, they generally fall into three categories: those for the Son of Heaven, for nobles and high officials, and for commoners. Since ranks differ, their forms must not be conflated without distinction.\n\nThe codes also state: Offerings for petitions should be distributed to the poor to cultivate hidden virtue; the master must not use them entirely for himself. Calculating by tenths, the master may only take three parts for his own use. The celestial statutes are severe—those who violate them incur punishment from the Three Officials, their misfortune extending to nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude as lowly spirits. How could one not be cautious!\n\nNow, these matters are arranged and compared, with clear principles established, so that practitioners may know the proper order.\n\n**Petition

three hundred major petitions. Though each petition includes its own offerings, the teachings have been transmitted for a long time, and practitioners often make additions or omissions.

Here, three grades are extracted as a standard.\n\n**Silk and Colors:**\nThe Son of Heaven uses purple silk in *pi* and *shu* quantities; princes and dukes use their life-color silk in *zhang* quantities; commoners use plain silk in *chi* quantities.\n\n**Ritual Coins:**\nThe Son of Heaven uses gold coins; princes and dukes use silver coins; commoners use copper coins.\n\n**Rice Offerings:**\nThe Son of Heaven offers three *shi* and six *dou*; princes and dukes offer two *shi* and four *dou*; commoners offer one *shi* and two *dou*.\n\n**Ritual Oil:**\nThe Son of Heaven offers one *shi* and two *dou*; princes and dukes offer six *dou* and four *sheng*; commoners offer two *dou* and two *sheng*.\n\n**Incense:**\nThe Son of Heaven offers a full *jin*; princes and dukes offer half a *jin*; commoners offer three or five *liang*.\n\n**Paper, Brushes, Ink, and Cinnabar:**\nThese are provided for the officiant to draft petitions, correct errors, and revise drafts. All petitions must include them; none may be omitted. Other items follow their original categories and quantities. Violations will result in a reduction of lifespan.\n\n**Petition Texts**\nWhen submitting a petition, first prepare a written statement listing one’s native place, village name, official title, full name, age, household members, living dependents, and the number of males and females, young and old. According to Daoist regulations, present the ritual offerings at a designated place to a designated master, requesting the submission of the petition. Humbly beseech compassion and special intervention. The statement should convey the matter plainly, without ornamentation—unrefined yet not crude, simple yet not ostentatious, truthful yet not deceitful, direct yet not unrestrained, articulate yet not verbose, modest yet not vulgar, pure yet not turbid. If sincerity is concise and earnest, it will move Heaven and Earth, stir spirits and gods, ascend to the celestial bureaus, and bring swift retribution.

Then declare:\n\n*\"Primordial Life True Person, Generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou, there is now a man or woman named so-and-so suffering from illness, who petitions me for aid and protection. I reverently follow the Daoist method, bestowing upon so-and-so this true talisman of the Dao to swallow or wear. May the true officials, direct talisman messengers, and the hundred thousand myriad layers of Dao qi descend into this talisman by command. Let the spirits mobilize the qi, search out and expel evil spirits, execute demonic thieves, and deliver salvation to the celestial and human realms.\"*\n\nNext, visualize the five-colored true qi before the altar. Above the true qi, to the left and right, stand the Direct Talisman Lads, clad in vermilion robes and azure skirts. Before the altar stands a Talisman General in vermilion robes and a dark crown, girded with a sword and holding a battle-axe. To his left and right stand two Direct Talisman Attendants, wearing yellow caps, yellow skirts, and crimson-brown garments, each holding a sword. Before me are the sun on the left and the moon on the right, nine inches from my face, their radiance covering a vermilion vessel. Above my head are the Seven Stars, the stars upon my head, and the *piao* upon the vermilion vessel.\n\nOnce this is complete, recite thrice: *\"Conjoined Brightness of the Heavenly Thearch and the Sun.\"*\n\nThen, visualize the vermilion brush as a *tengshe*, hold the breath, and write the talisman.\n\n**General Method for Writing Talismans**\nFirst, outline the four sides of the talisman with azure ink, then write the talisman text within in cinnabar. If azure ink is unavailable, cinnabar may also be used.\n\nWhen writing talismans to cure illnesses caused by evil, use true cinnabar mixed with tiger bone. Once ground, dip the brush and write the talisman while reciting the incantation:\n\n*\"I solemnly command the true officials within my five bodily constituents: my hun-soul is the Heavenly Father, my po-soul is the Earthly Mother, my head is Lord Thunder, my hair is black clouds, my crown is the Bright Star, my forehead is the Vermilion Bird, my eyebrows are the Qilin, my eyes are the sun and moon, my nose is the Mighty Tiger, my upper lip is the Earl of Wind, my lower lip is the Master of Rain, my tongue is the Governor of the Nine Provinces, my throat is the Nine-Layered Tower, my left cheek is the Eastern Kingly Lord, my right cheek is the Queen Mother of the West, my ears are the Immortal Lads of Distant Hearing, my neck is the Heavenly Pillar, my shoulders are the Vajras, my elbows are the Mighty Warriors, my left arm is the Great General Xuanji of Expelling Barbarians, my right arm is the Great General Yuheng of Breaking Barbarians, my palms are fire chariots, my fingers are armored soldiers, my liver is the Green Thearch, my lungs are the White Thearch, my heart is the Red Thearch, my kidneys are the Black Thearch, my spleen is the Yellow Thearch, my intestines are the Yellow Dragon, my gallbladder is the Great One, my bladder is the River Earl, my blood is the Water Official, my sinews are the Heavenly Net, my bones are the Earthly Net, my hair is the Heavenly Snare, my feet are the White Horse, my forward steps are the Three Officials, each leading seventy million troops. Mounting great chariots, they emerge from within my body to assist me in writing the talisman and mobilizing the qi, destroying and executing malevolent demons, *wangliang*, *chimei*, evil ghosts, and perverse qi. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the oral command of the Most High!\"*\n\nFor the *jiazi*旬, the Illness-Curing Messenger commands the Black Merit Clerk; at the *zi* hour, the Most High returns to govern.\nFor the *jiaxu*旬, the Illness-Curing Messenger commands the Illness-Curing Merit Clerk; at the *xu* hour, the Most High returns to govern.\n\nFor the *jiashen*旬, the Illness-Curing Messenger commands the Illness-Curing Merit Clerk; at the *shen* hour, the Most High returns to govern.\nFor the *jiawu*旬, the Illness-Curing Messenger commands the Orthodox Unity Merit Clerk; at midday, the Most High returns to govern.\nFor the *jiachen*旬, the Illness-Curing Messenger commands the Central Department Merit Clerk; at the breakfast hour, the Most High returns to govern.\nFor the *jiayin*旬, the Illness-Curing Messenger commands the Direct Attendant Merit Clerk; at dawn, the Most High returns to govern.\n\nWhenever writing talismans, make your petition at these times for swift efficacy in talismanic restraint.\n\n**Method for Writing Memorials**\nWhen writing memorials, do not mix brushes and inkstones. Grind the ink by rotating the inkstick leftward forty-nine times; the grinding stone should be treated likewise. The heading \"With respectful hearing\" should be placed one inch below the first bow. The supplicant’s surname should be placed three lines below \"With respectful hearing.\" \"Great Clarity\" should be placed three lines below the supplicant’s surname. \"Great Year\" should be placed three lines below \"Great Clarity.\"\n\nIf a memorial is completed but contains minor matters, it may not be submitted for a year. If small characters have not yet been added, it may be submitted within a month. For small characters: the upper measure is three inches and five *fen*, the middle measure four inches and five *fen*, and the lower measure five inches—no more than this. Many today speak of one inch and five *fen*, which is incorrect. When the memorial reaches \"Great Year,\" if the paper is exhausted, it may not be submitted. If there is a presiding officer to deliver it, then it may. If two lines remain, the paper may be fully extended to continue.\n\nFor errors or omitted characters: small memorials should not exceed three characters; large memorials should be judged by context. When writing memorials, leave eight *fen* of space at the top and allow the bottom to extend to the edge of the paper. Place a cloth on the desk when writing memorials; do not let them touch the bed. Do not place clothing on the memorial or let it fall to the ground.\n\nWhen writing memorials, enter a state of stillness. Do not allow ordinary people to cause disturbance, nor discuss other matters or speak of foul or defiling things. When writing memorials, do not dip the brush in water or in the mouth. Keep the mouth closed, do not eat anything, and avoid exhaling forcefully. Wash hands clean and face north when writing. If the body has been defiled, do not write memorials. Do not write incomplete or flawed characters, nor use torn or damaged paper. Do not drink alcohol, eat meat, or expose oneself to foul odors. Dress in proper attire; do not expose the body.\n\nWhen writing memorials, one must prostrate oneself in reverence; do not squat or sit casually. After completing a memorial, first proofread it once before submitting it. The character \"Your servant\" (*chen*) must not appear at the beginning of a line, nor should it be placed where the living and dead are juxtaposed. The character for \"ghost\" must not occupy the start of a line. Do not tear out or damage a person’s name, nor allow others to secretly read it, lest it disturb the Great Clarity. The characters for \"sun\" and \"moon\" should not be written in advance; they should be added at the time of submission.\n\nIf submitting an urgent memorial, use a vermilion brush for the heading. When submitting a memorial to expel ghosts, write in vermilion the name of the Orthodox Unity disciple submitting it. For memorials to cure illnesses caused by malevolent spirits, use blue paper. The Lords and Officers of the Three Officials hold blue in high esteem. For memorials to strike down ghostly illnesses caused by *zhu* qi, write in vermilion on blue paper.\n\nAfter the memorial is submitted, burn it in the place of treatment. Grind two parts of true cinnabar and mix with honey to form pills. At dawn, enter the oratory, bow twice, and consume them—even those at death’s door will revive. Let no one know of this.\n\nIf writing a memorial due to illness while in the oratory, burn incense on all four sides.\n\n**Three Primordial Days**\nThe fifteenth day of the first month is the Upper Primordial.\n\nThe fifteenth day of the seventh month is the Middle Primordial. The fifteenth day of the tenth month is the Lower Primordial. These are the days when the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water conduct their inspections; one may perform purification rites and pray for blessings.\n\n**Three Assembly Days**\nThe fifth day of the first month is the Upper Assembly.\nThe seventh day of the seventh month is the Middle Assembly.\nThe fifth day of the tenth month is the Lower Assembly.\nOn these days, one should submit memorials to report merits, undeterred by fierce winds, torrential rains, eclipses of the sun and moon, or the closure of Heaven and Earth’s gates. On these days, the Heavenly Thearch and all the great sages descend together, assembling in the ritual hall, their forms and shadows spreading in unison even ten thousand *li* away.\n\nOn these days, when submitting memorials, receiving registers of the Dao, or bestowing precepts, men and women who practice virtue and perform meritorious deeds will have their calamities dispersed and misfortunes dissolved, with no prohibitions in place.\n\n**Copying the *Nüqing Guilu***\nOne copy of the *Nüqing Guilu* may be made on the following days:\n- Heavenly Assembly: *bingwu* day\n- Earthly Assembly: *renwu* day\n- Human Assembly: *renzi* day\n- Solar Assembly: *gengwu* day\n- Lunar Assembly: *gengshen* day\n- Stellar Assembly: *xinyou* day\n- Five Phases Assembly: *jiachen* day\n- Four Seasons Assembly: *jiaxu* day\n- Heavenly Festival: *jiawu* day\n- Earthly Festival: *jiashen* day\n- Human Festival: *jiazi* day\n\nOn the above days, one may perform meritorious deeds and pray for great fortune.\n\n**Clashing Hours**\nThe *zi* hour clashes with the *wu* hour; the *wu* hour clashes with the *zi* hour. For all initiations and offerings, the *zi* and *wu* hours are most suitable. If a clashing hour coincides with the Dipper striking the *zi* position, avoid the *zi* hour; if it strikes the *wu* position, avoid the *wu* hour. In urgent cases, avoidance is still preferable.\n\n**Orientation for Memorials**\nAt midday, submit memorials facing east; at night, face north.\nIt is also said: When receiving precepts by day, face east. For breaking contracts at *zi* or *wu*, invoking life stars, or submitting urgent memorials, face north and visualize the Great Thearch. Except for major memorials concerning stellar matters, grand altar rites, or urgent matters of capture and expulsion, there is no need to expose them openly.\n\nFor treating illnesses, face the Ghost Gate. For dissolving calamities, face the Earth Gate. For seeking longevity, face the Heaven Gate. For seeking wealth and honor, face the Earth Gate. For dispelling slander and curses, face the Human Gate. For suppressing tigers, face the *yin* direction. For suppressing snakes, face the *si* direction.\n\nIt is further said: For performing blessings, extending years, dissolving calamities, and suppressing illnesses, face east. For resolving ancestral grievances, opening the heart to wisdom, and transcending calamities, face west. For critical illnesses or submitting memorials and talismans to save the dying, face north. For cultivating life and seeking wealth and honor, face south. For submitting memorials to atone for sins, face north.\n\nWhen treating illnesses:\n- In the first, fifth, seventh, and ninth months, do not face east.\n- In the fourth, eighth, and twelfth months, do not face south.\n- In the third, seventh, and tenth months, do not face west.\n- In the second, sixth, and tenth months, do not face north.\n\nThe above orientations for memorials, talismans, and treatments must not be transgressed.

The Five La Days mark the end of the five phases’ cycles, when the old and new intersect. They are auspicious for seeking the Dao, invoking mercy, and receiving the descending life-qi to augment one’s spirit and extend one’s destiny. On these days, the Five Emperors convene in the Mystic Capital to govern the human realm, the underworld, the Five Marchmounts, the Four Waterways, and the thirty-six thousand yin and yang forces, reviewing and extending the lives of mortals. Those who cultivate the Dao and seek immortality should observe these days with fasting, ablutions, and rituals to the Perfected.\"\n\n\"Now, I transmit this profound teaching for diligent practice:\n- **First day of the first month (Heavenly La)**: The Five Emperors review mortals’ spirit-qi and lifespans, augmenting their years. This day is suitable for praying for offspring, sacrificing to ancestors, and ascending to the Mystic Ancestors. Avoid blocking ditches or indulging in labor or lust; instead, chant hymns and guide the spirit-qi.\n- **Fifth day of the fifth month (Earthly La)**: The Five Emperors review mortals’ ranks, physical vitality, and longevity, recording the names of those destined for immortality. This day is suitable for repenting sins, seeking promotions, and sacrificing to the Mystic Ancestors. Avoid felling trees or consuming blood; practice qi-absorption and harmonize the Four Great Elements.\n- **Seventh day of the seventh month (Moral La)**: The Five Emperors review mortals’ skeletal health, scholarly pursuits, and official ranks. This day is suitable for repenting sins, seeking blessings, absorbing qi, bathing, and sacrificing to ancestors. Avoid felling trees, crushing stones, or consuming sour or salty foods; do not ride near perilous places. Practice guiding and stretching the sinews.\n- **First day of the tenth month (People’s Year La)**: The Five Emperors review mortals’ emoluments, ranks, lifespans, and illnesses. This day is suitable for repenting sins, seeking extended destiny, sacrificing to ancestors, and bathing for the Mystic Ancestors. Avoid overeating or drunken stupor; instead, perform rituals and circumambulate altars.\n- **Twelfth month (Kings and Lords La)**: The Five Emperors review mortals’ dwellings, emoluments, and the distribution of the Three Luminaries’ qi to the thirty-six thousand spirits. This day is suitable for repenting sins, seeking longevity, pacifying the hundred spirits, altering one’s status, reversing poverty, bathing, sacrificing to ancestors, and performing grand rituals to the Heavenly Officials to fulfill wishes and attain the Dao. Avoid feasting or revelry; instead, practice purity while traversing sacred mountains or altars, reciting scriptures, and focusing the three hun and seven po. Do not engage in mundane affairs—whenever a La Day arrives, observe it thus.\"\n\nWith utmost reverence, the regulations state: All memorials must include the phrase 'with utmost reverence.'\"\n\nShould one violate these precepts, their allotted lifespan shall be diminished.\n\n**Kneeling in prostration, bowing twice**\nThe regulations state: For minor ailments, all matters should be treated with leniency.

Violators shall be subject to *Er Xing* punishment.\n\n*Er Xing* entails sweeping roads and repairing bridges. *Wu Xing* punishment requires delivering three thousand bundles of thatch to the Heavenly Master for roof repairs. *Liu Xing* punishment demands supplying two thousand roof tiles. *Yi Xing* entails sweeping roads for twenty days; *Er Xing*, for twenty days. A *Ji* refers to one year; an *allotted span* denotes ten days, or sometimes one day per span. For grave matters, memorials may extend to three or four hundred characters; for those on the brink of death, five hundred characters. Minor matters should be limited to one or two hundred characters—excessive length disperses vital qi, causing officials and soldiers to fail in their duties.\n\nFor urgent memorials, invoke *Tian Chang Jun*, accompanied by one hundred thousand yellow-robed soldiers. Alternatively, enter the oratory, face east, and orally petition to summon one hundred twenty calamities and malevolent spirits from within and without, including the twelve *Xing Sha* ghosts. For afflictions of the face, submit a memorial and enter the oratory to invoke *Tian Ming Jun* and five attendants, with one hundred twenty officials stationed beneath the Southern Palace to treat facial ailments. For rebellious qi, vomiting, or diarrhea of the five epidemics, five poisons, six *liu*, or six ghosts, invoke *Beixing Daji Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials stationed beneath the Six Palaces to administer treatment. For distension in the right abdomen, cramping of the small intestine, *Daixia*, or the twelve disease-causing ghosts, invoke *Feng Li Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials to provide remedy. For undigested food, hardened accumulations, or unrelenting strangury, invoke *Chi Su Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials to administer treatment. For counterflow qi, acute pain, abdominal hardness, or inability to retain food, invoke *Wu Heng Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials stationed beneath the Great Mound Palace to provide remedy. For vomiting and counterflow, invoke *Wu Heng Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials stationed in the *Taiping* Palace. For distension in the lower abdomen, invoke *Jiuhe Beihai Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials stationed in the *Heyuan* Palace. For illnesses caused by well or stove ghosts, invoke *Wang Fa Jun* and five attendants, with one hundred twenty officials stationed in the Five Surnames Palace to suppress and eradicate them. For carbuncles and abscesses, invoke *Jiu Ji Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials stationed in the Western Jade Palace to administer treatment. For emaciation, bone dissolution, and extreme exhaustion, invoke *Yang Zhi Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials on each side to provide remedy. To prolong life, invoke *Nan Shang Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials stationed in the *Cangguo* Palace to bestow longevity and immortality. For chronic bedridden suffering, invoke *Xu Yi Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials to administer treatment. To suppress malevolent spirits within the household, invoke *Shi Xian Jun* and one attendant, with one hundred twenty officials to subdue them. To expel old qi, sever ghostly afflictions, avert death, and invite rebirth, or to transform misfortune into fortune, invoke *Yi Tian Jiangjun* with one hundred thousand soldiers to capture and eradicate them. To subdue the essences of ancient spirits invading the household, invoke *Shangyuan Shijun* and one attendant, with one hundred twenty officials to apprehend them. For violations of one’s *Xingnian Benming*, *Taisui* earth, Five Graves, or *Chen Jian Po*, invoke *Zhi Di Jun* and five attendants, with one hundred twenty officials to descend to their palace and eradicate them. For inauspicious qi or litigious ghosts causing household unrest, invoke *Hu Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials to dissolve and sever them. For frequent deaths or personal afflictions of punishment and harm, invoke *Yunqi Jie’e Jun*, with seven hundred thousand soldiers to administer treatment. For disturbances by Five Graves ghosts or wandering harming spirits, invoke *Wushang Gaocang Jun*, with seven hundred thousand soldiers to capture and eradicate them. For recurrent household fires, invoke *Wushang Tian Jun*, with one hundred thousand soldiers to sever them. To break ancestral temple curses or expel demonic objects, invoke *Ping Tian Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials stationed in the Northern *Shuo* Palace to administer treatment. To pursue immortality while plagued by lingering illnesses, invoke *Xusu Tianjing Jun*, with one hundred thousand red-robed soldiers stationed in the *Tianzhu* Palace to suppress ghosts, eradicate misfortune, and repel the qi of the Red Heaven.\n\nIf the household harbors malevolent ghosts that refuse to disperse and persist in their mischief, invoke *Chi Tian Shi Qi Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials to administer treatment. If the household suffers from unease in the *kan* trigram, disordered dreams, or unanchored hun and po souls, invoke *Shoushen Shangyu Jun*, with one hundred twenty officials to govern and heal.\n\nThe officials invoked to treat illnesses correspond to the twenty-four spirits residing within the body. The numbers of officials, generals, scribes, and soldiers all arise from the Daoist Three *Qi* in response to circumstances—these are not beings born of Heaven and Earth. When sincerity is expressed, resonance is achieved through things, and thus *qi* takes form to become scribes and soldiers.\n\nThe remaining official titles are recorded in the *One Thousand Two Hundred Official Rites*. These twenty-four principal titles correspond to the twenty-four spirits within the body. In times of urgency, invoke them according to the matter at hand; all will prove efficacious. Alternatively, one may enter the oratory, burn incense, and orally petition the four directions to seek deliverance.\n\n**Method for Sealing Memorials**\n\nOnce the memorial is read, place it on the memorial table and secure it with a vermilion brush and a ritual knife. After the recitation is complete, roll it tightly according to protocol, pass it through incense smoke, and seal it with a whole sheet of paper. The address shall read:\n\n*Most reverently presented to the Jade Sovereign of the Golden Portal of Spontaneous Emptiness.*\n\nBelow, state the rank of the petitioner:\n\n*Tai Xuan Du Zhengyi Ping Qi, affiliated with Celestial Master Yangping District, Left Ping Qi Gate, holding the rank of Third-Grade Grand Capital Merit, concurrently Left Censor and Libationer, Chi Tian Sanwu Bugang Yuanming Zhenren, your subject [Name], respectfully seals this memorial.*\n\nNext, place the memorial in its case, bind it with three strands of green silk, and fill the seal’s impression well with wax. Affix the seal of the *Nine Elder Immortals’ Capital*. Then, enclose it in an outer wrapping of green paper. First, mark it with vermilion dots—ensure the top and bottom are not inverted. Then seal both ends, inscribing a complete character. Write in vermilion and impress each with the seal.\n\nThe outer wrapper shall be addressed as follows:\n\n*Respectfully submitted on behalf of the disciple of the Great Dao, [Official Title and Name], for the matter of [specific purpose], presenting [number] memorials, most humbly delivered to the Gate of the Three Heavens for transmission.*\n\nThe characters *Gate of the Three Heavens* must be written level. The characters *for transmission* shall be inscribed to the side of *Gate of the Three Heavens*. Below, state the petitioner’s rank as before: *[Name] respectfully seals this memorial.* Impress the seal over the *respectfully seals* inscription. *Defilement and impurity.*\n\n**Regulations on Defilement and Impurity**\n\nThe statutes prescribe: When a household experiences a death, regardless of age, or when a woman gives birth, the defilement for a major funeral shall last one hundred days. For childbirth, as it harms the woman’s body, the defilement shall also last one hundred days. Entering the chamber of a woman in labor incurs three days of defilement. The death of a child or servant incurs one month of defilement. The death of livestock incurs one day of defilement. If the death occurs outside the household, there shall be no defilement. For a one-year mourning period, the defilement lasts forty days. For *da gong* and *si ma* mourning, defilement applies within the month; after the month has passed, it is lifted. Visiting a bereaved household to weep incurs defilement for that day. Prolonged mourning incurs no defilement. One must not partake of sacrificial food at a funeral, nor of food offered three days after childbirth or at the full-month celebration. None of the aforementioned defilements may engage in purification rites, set up *jiao* offerings, or present memorials. If encountered elsewhere, the defilement may be dispelled with talismanic water.\n\n---\n\n**Regulations on Visualization**\n\nUpon completing the ritual recitations, prostrate before the altar and visualize a crimson *qi* emanating from your heart, ascending to the heavens. After a moment, as if traversing a hundred *li*, the path of crimson *qi* stretches boundlessly, unobstructed by blemish or shadow, lined only with jeweled trees. Suddenly, a yellow path appears—this is the Yellow Path of the Sun and Moon. After crossing five or six *li* beyond it, distant purple clouds loom faintly. Upon reaching the purple clouds, the Gate of Heaven comes into view. The gate spans one *zhang* and eight *chi*, and all attendants halt. Only the Perimeter General, the Direct Envoy, and the Merit Clerk may transmit the memorial. Jade lads bear the memorial to the threshold, where they present it to the west. There, the Orthodox Unity Three Heavens Master, surnamed Zhang and named Daoling, is seen. After bowing, the details of the memorial are fully recited. The Heavenly Master performs nine prostrations, then proceeds to the Phoenix Pavilion Gate to enter. Soon, a jade lad in vermilion robes and a dark cap emerges to receive the memorial. The jade lads take the memorial inside, and after a brief moment, reemerge to escort the petitioner before the Most High. The Most High wears a robe of nine-colored cloud radiance and a crown of ninefold virtue, seated upon the dais with the Two Mystic Perfected Ones attending to his left and right. The Great One, clad in vermilion robes and a dark cap, presents the memorial to the Most High. After a single glance, the Great One, following the Most High’s intent, inscribes \"By the command of the Jade Emperor of the Great Clarity\" and affixes the proper characters. The task complete, another jade lad collects the memorial from the right steps and entrusts it to the Duty Clerk of the day. The petitioner bows in reverence, takes leave of the Most High, and departs. Again, he bows to take leave of the Heavenly Master. Together with the memorial’s divine officials, he rejoices and returns to the place of presentation. Rising, he announces the completion of the ritual.\n\n---\n\n**Auspicious and Inauspicious Days for Petitioning Peace**\n\nFor *Petitioning Peace* memorials and *jiao* rites, the myriad heavens descend, bestowing blessings upon the living—most auspicious.\nFor *Jade Hall* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens rejoice, extending felicity and longevity—most auspicious.\nFor *Golden Hall* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens send down numinous power, prolonging years and increasing destiny—most auspicious.\nFor *Dragon-Tiger* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens do not descend, and blessings are few.\nFor *Sin’s Arrival* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens are vexed, grievances go unaddressed—most inauspicious.\nFor *Reverent Heart* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens rejoice, divine spirits witness and accept, bringing fortune.\nFor *Universal Protection* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens bestow blessings, with abundant felicity.\nFor *Fortune’s Birth* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens assemble in joy—most auspicious.\nFor *Receiving Death* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens record sins, and the host suffers calamity—most inauspicious.\nFor *Sacred Heart* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens assess blessings, prolonging and increasing them—most auspicious.\nFor *Benefiting the Future* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens rejoice, delivering salvation to the myriad people—most auspicious.\nFor *Continuing the Line* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens open to prosperity, and prayers for blessings are answered.\n\nThe above auspicious days correspond to the twelve months. For each month, consult the twelve earthly branches to determine the day’s fortune:\n\n**Months:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\n**Petitioning Peace:** *yin, shen, mao, you, chen, xu, si, hai, wu, zi, wei, chou*\n**Jade Hall:** *mao, you, chen, xu, si, hai, wu, zi, wei, chou, shen, yin*\n**Golden Hall:** *chen, xu, si, hai, wu, zi, wei, chou, shen, yin, mao, you*\n**Dragon-Tiger:** *si, hai, wu, zi, wei, chou, shen, yin, you, mao, xu, chen*\n**Sin’s Arrival:** *wu, zi, wei, chou, shen, yin, you, mao, xu, chen, hai, si*\n**Reverent Heart:** *wei, chou, shen, yin, you, mao, xu, chen, hai, si, zi, wu*\n**Universal Protection:** *shen, yin, you, mao, xu, chen, hai, si, zi, wu, chou, wei*\n**Fortune’s Birth:** *you, mao, xu, chen, hai, si, zi, wu, chou, wei, yin, shen*\n**Receiving Death:** *xu, chen, hai, si, zi, wu, chou, wei, yin, shen, mao, you*\n**Sacred Heart:** *hai, si, zi, wu, chou, wei, yin, shen, mao, you, chen, xu*\n**Benefiting the Future:** *zi, wu, chou, wei, yin, shen, mao, you, chen, xu, si, hai*\n**Continuing the Line:** *chou, wei, yin, shen, mao, you, chen, xu, si, hai, wu, zi*\n\n---\n\n**Storing Memorials (Original Text of the *Tai Zhen Statutes*)**\n\nAfter presenting a memorial on another’s behalf, once all minor memorials have been returned to the incense burner, roll them and place them in a case. Carry them out separately, then retrieve all major memorials at once, recording them as prescribed. If they are to be burned, do so before the incense burner. If transporting memorials from elsewhere, inscribe, seal, and secure them to prevent exposure to insects, rodents, or bartering for profit—violations contravene the Most High’s decrees. Memorials contain the titles of true officials, the names of spirits and deities, and secret numinous instructions; they must not be defiled. All memorials have original copies, which serve as clear references for verification. Never use old copies. As circumstances and petitions differ, so too do the celestial palaces addressed. Common households must not retain copies of memorials. Violations are punishable by the Five Punishments.\n\n---\n\n**Severing Memorials (From the *Tai Zhen Statutes*)**\n\nIt is stated: \"Respectfully following the documents, your servant [Name], in accordance with the law, cultivates and propagates the *qi* of the Dao, summons true officials, and protects the myriad people. For the memorials presented, those that should be burned but were not, sealed and stored in cabinets, rolled and bundled in accumulation—by law, they may not be scattered. Fearing damage by insects, rodents, dampness, or decay, or the loss of any part, I have always strictly adhered to the statutes and dared not violate the decree. Today, in accordance with the regulations, I sever and offer them accordingly.\"\n\nFrom the [specified] year, month, and day, a total of [number] memorials shall be conveyed to a pure altar or purified site, where they are to be incinerated, their smoke ascending to convey the numinous and descend the *qi*, spreading fortune and dispelling misfortune.\n\nRespectfully, I invoke the presence of the Directing Envoy of the Orthodox Unity, the Merit Officers of the Celestial Bureaus, the Tiger-Rushing Guardians of the Central Office—two each from the Five Hundreds—and twelve Commandants. Further, five each of the Merit Officers, Scribes, Assistants, Lesser Clerks, and Golden Radiance Lads; two each of the Supervisors of the Central Registers, Couriers, and Attendant Envoys. May they all simultaneously oversee the proceedings, jointly examine and verify, burn away the old and dust-laden, and receive the radiance of the new, thereby pardoning this servant’s foolish shortcomings and inadvertent transgressions.\n\nMay the previously printed and transcribed memorials ascend forever to the Celestial Archives, and may all subsequently submitted petitions be spared the Cold Pond. Let the assembled officials bear witness, rewarding and aiding those who have rendered service, in accordance with the statutes governing merit and without betraying the trust of efficacy.\n\nI humbly beseech the Most High to discern and heed this plea.\n\nThe number of severed memorials varies, for times differ in abundance and restraint, and the law adapts to action or concealment. When concealed, fewer are required; when enacted, more. The tally is completed upon reaching one hundred memorials for severance. As stated earlier, each year’s severance concludes in the tenth month.\n\n**Memorials and Cases**\nThe case for memorials shall measure two feet four inches in length, one foot two inches in width, and eight inches in height, and must feature curved legs. Nanmu or catalpa wood is preferred. Modern use of tall, straight-legged cases is contrary to the statutes and will result in the forfeiture of one’s allotted years.\n\n**The Heavenly Elder Questions the Three Sovereigns**\nThe Heavenly Elder questioned the Three Sovereigns: “Why are talismans made on *wuxu* days?”\n\nThe Three Sovereigns replied: “*Xu* is the Gate of Heaven. *Wu* is the likeness of the Earth’s Central Office and its Lord. The Heavenly Thearch customarily descends from the Gate of Heaven to wander on *wuxu* days. When talismans are crafted on this day, he rejoices and bestows the fulfillment of wishes. *Wu* pertains to earth; thus, one is certain to attain official rank, be enfeoffed as a marquis, and receive a domain.”\n\nThey are to be worn at the hour of *wu*, for *wu* embodies the essence of the Great Yang and the radiance of pure metal—an emblem of lofty rank and golden-purple eminence.\n\n**Avoidances and Taboos**\n\n**Regulations and Prohibitions**\n\nThe Regulations state: When submitting memorials or performing *jiao* rites, disciples must not take life. Violations reduce one’s allotted years by twenty-four.\n\nWhen submitting memorials, all members of the household, including fowl and dogs, must not create clamor. Violations incur a penalty of twelve years’ reduction.\n\nMemorials must not be submitted during great winds, heavy rains, or prolonged storms. Violations result in one year of illness.\n\nThose afflicted with the six ailments must not submit memorials on behalf of others. Violations reduce one’s allotted years by thirty-six.\n\nWhen submitting memorials, one must not consume wine, meat, or the five pungent vegetables. Violations reduce one’s allotted years by twelve.\n\n**Prohibitions**\n\nThe Prohibitions state: When submitting memorials in the offices of the Dao to request official appointments, one must not transgress or err. Those defiled by impurity must not enter the ritual space.\n\nThose who have witnessed a burial must not enter rivers, mountains, marshes, or forests. Livestock that have given birth within seven days must not enter the ritual space. Infants under one hundred days old must not enter the ritual space. Livestock that have borne young within a month must not enter the ritual space.\n\nObjects of faith used in memorials and *jiao* rites must not be lent to others. Within the ritual space, one must not burn foul or odorous substances, nor feathers, hides, or horns.\n\nAll who enter the ritual space must do so with reverence and solemnity, performing rites of obeisance. One must not act with arrogance or irreverence.\n\nWithin the ritual space, one must not point or gesture, speak recklessly or unlawfully, or engage in frivolous speech or laughter. One must not expose the body.\n\nOfferings of faith must be distributed among the Daoist faithful.\n\nWhen approaching the ritual space to submit memorials for the salvation of the sick or the alleviation of misfortune, one must don a sash, wear wooden clogs, and bow respectfully, knocking one’s head to the ground while recounting the matter in full. One must not act with arrogance, cruelty, or haughtiness, nor raise one’s voice in self-aggrandizement. Violations are judged under the three penalties.\n\nThe Decrees state: If a father is afflicted with illness or misfortune while his son bears the great register of the Celestial Master, the father must don a cap and hempen robe, knock his head to the ground, and strike his cheeks. Only then may the son enter the ritual space to submit the memorial.\n\nThe Decrees state: If father and son seek to make requests improperly, both father and son are judged under the three penalties. The same applies to brothers.\n\nThe Decrees state: If a woman holds a register of the Dao and her husband faces urgent misfortune, he must don a sash, wear wooden clogs, and bow respectfully according to the rites. Only then may the woman enter the oratory to submit the memorial.\n\nThe Decrees state: If a husband makes a request improperly, he is judged under two penalties. If a wife fails to proclaim the decree clearly, she is judged under three penalties.\n\nThe Decrees state: If an uncle or elder male cousin is afflicted with illness or misfortune while a nephew or younger male cousin bears the register, the latter must submit a memorial as in the case of father and son.\n\nThe Decrees state: If a mother’s brother or sister is afflicted with illness or misfortune, and their children or grandchildren seek to submit a memorial, they must do so as in the case of uncles and nephews.\n\nThe Decrees state: Those who commit heinous acts—wielding the sword to execute, plotting against their lord, or murdering their father—are guilty of great treason. No amount of wealth or merit can atone for such crimes. They shall tread upon the Mountain of Knives, ascend the Forest of Swords, endure the cauldron’s boiling waters, and suffer burning and scalding for ten thousand generations without reprieve, their sins beyond redemption.\n\n**Disciplinary Statutes**\n\nThe Disciplinary Statutes state: Within the human body resides a spirit that records transgressions, ascending and descending with the passing of time, daily noting good and evil.\n\nOne hundred and twenty transgressions form a *ke*, which brings more harm than benefit. One hundred and eighty transgressions form a *hao*, which causes livestock to fail to reproduce. Ten transgressions form a *bian*, which brings illness. Five hundred and forty transgressions form a *xiong*, which harms the fetus and injures children. Seven hundred and twenty transgressions form a *chui*, which brings death. Seven hundred and twenty-nine transgressions form a *yang*, which causes muteness, paralysis, blindness, or deafness. One thousand and eighty transgressions form a *huo*, which brings sudden, premature death. One thousand two hundred transgressions form a *can*, which produces rebellious offspring. One thousand two hundred and sixty transgressions form a *jiu*, which severs the line of descent. One thousand four hundred transgressions form a *ji*, which brings calamity flowing through five generations. One thousand six hundred and twenty transgressions form a *zhe*, which severs the lineage, leaving no descendants. One thousand eight hundred transgressions form a *huan*, which causes the family to produce those afflicted with madness or idiocy. Two thousand and sixty transgressions form a *bao*, which brings violent death by weapons. Two thousand three hundred and thirty transgressions form a *xu*, which causes family members—father and son, brothers—to attack one another. Two thousand five hundred and twenty transgressions form a *zeng*, which brings severe skin diseases to the family. Two thousand seven hundred transgressions form a *hai*, which causes deafness in the family. Two thousand eight hundred transgressions form a *zai*, which brings familial incest, depravity, and rebellion. Three thousand and sixty transgressions form a *yi*, which causes the family to produce the blind, the castrated, or the mutilated. Three thousand one hundred and thirty transgressions form a *bian*, which brings imprisonment, execution, or the extermination of the clan. Three thousand one hundred and fifty transgressions form a *guai*, which causes the family to produce beggars in the marketplace, their bones discarded and abandoned. Three thousand six hundred transgressions form a *man*, which necessitates death.\n\nThe Statutes state: Some die at twenty or thirty, their *ke* filled with misfortune and early death. Others reach fifty or sixty before their *ke* fills with misfortune and early death. Some, though having committed no transgressions in youth, die prematurely—these inherit the residual transgressions of past lives. Others, though committing great evil and treason, live out their years without encountering disaster—they inherit the residual blessings of their ancestors.\n\nThus, the accumulation of virtue leaves residual fortune, while the accumulation of evil leaves residual misfortune. If one can repent of transgressions, they vanish and fortune arises. One must reflect on one’s faults, take responsibility, reform, and never repeat them. Practicing this for ten days removes one *ke* of transgressions from the spirit within. Practicing for one hundred days removes two *ke*. Practicing for one year removes three *ke*. Practicing for three years brings the corresponding fortune.\n\nIf one does not reflect or repent, transgressions deepen daily. Minor transgressions harm only oneself; major transgressions flow down to descendants. Accumulated goodness is like dust upon a beam; accumulated evil is like smoke within a chimney. How can one not be vigilant?\n\n**Auspicious Days for Receiving Registers**\n\n**Auspicious Days for Receiving Registers**\n\n**Days of Righteousness (義日):**\nJiazi, Bingyin, Dingmao, Xinwei, Renshen, Guiyou, Yihai, Bingchen, Xinchou, Dingwei, Gengxu, Wuwu, Gengchen.\n\n**Days of Treasure (寶日):**\nJiawu, Dingchou, Bingxu, Gengzi, Renyin, Dingwei, Wushen, Jiyou, Xinhai, Guimao, Bingchen, Yisi, Bingxu, Bingchen.\n\n**Days of Dedication (專日):**\nJichou, Wuxu, Bingwu, Renzi, Jiayin, Yimao, Jiwei, Gengshen, Xinyou, Guihai, Wuchen, Dingsi, Bingchen, Yiwei.\n\nThe above Days of Righteousness, Treasure, and Dedication are auspicious for transmitting and receiving scriptures and registers, and are also recorded in the *Daoist Almanac*.\n\n**Days of Mutual and Self-Punishment (相刑自刑日):**\nZi punishes Mao; Mao punishes Zi.

An early liturgical manual for the Heavenly Master Dao tradition.\nSix scrolls.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Memorials and Petitions Category*.\n\n*Red Pine Master’s Memorial Almanac, Scroll Three*\n**Memorial for Drought** (天旱章)\n[Position the ritual implements...]\n\n**Memorial for Drought**\n\nWe humbly submit: According to the sacred writ, we, Your servants, though foolish and unworthy, have encountered this Daoist congregation and been blessed to witness this sagely age. By fortunate coincidence, we have been touched by the Great Law. We prostrate ourselves in gratitude to the Most High, whose vast embrace and merciful compassion of the Master Lords have bestowed upon us grace without the slightest merit of our own. Day and night, we tremble with dread, as though treading upon ice or crossing a ravine, unable to repay even a fraction of the恩 of Heaven and Earth.\n\nOn the day we received the Law, we vowed to serve the Master’s gate with reverence, to disseminate virtue and power, to assist the state and sustain life, to deliver all beings, and to place salvation of the myriad creatures above all else. Yet of late, the cycles of Heaven and Earth have turned adverse; yin and yang clash; the four seasons lose their proper measure. The realm suffers from severe drought; crops fail to ripen. We fear that demonic calamities will arise in succession: pure yang ascends, congealed yin lingers below; the two qi fail to interact; the mysterious moisture does not descend. Scorching winds and blazing sun afflict the people; crops wither and parch; fish in dried ponds dread the daylight.\n\nThis arises because the Son of Heaven, having received the Mandate of Heaven, rules over all domains, yet the Three Talents, the lords and governors, the ministers and local officials have failed to govern with due care, and their administrative achievements fall short. We, Your servants, bear the heavy responsibility of the Dao yet lack the means to propagate its transformative power. Unable to rectify and harmonize the proper sequence of qi, we have caused the Five Phases to lose their balance, inviting the onslaught of celestial disasters.\n\nWe have searched the statutes and laws: the qi of the Dao is vast and all-covering, moistening and nourishing all living beings. We have learned that Qian knows the Great Beginning, and Kun brings things to completion. When Heaven and Earth interact in harmony, all things flourish. Spring gives birth, summer nurtures growth, autumn brings harvest, and winter stores away. When yin and yang are harmonious and compliant, grasses and trees flourish, and the Five Grains ripen. The Great Yin governs rain. On the day of *Lichun*, men sow the fields, and women tend to mulberry and hemp, hoping that by autumn and winter they may provide tribute and taxes, sustaining all life under Heaven and upon Earth.\n\nIn the second month of *Lichun*, the Five Grains begin to be sown. When rainwater is balanced and harmonious, the Five Grains thrive, and harmonious qi accumulates. Yet for some days now, scorching drought has persisted; sweet rain has not fallen. Yang qi waxes excessive; the sky lacks the impulse to send forth clouds; the earth lacks the moisture of vital fluids. We, Your servants, though unworthy, dare not presume, yet in accordance with the statutes and laws of the Heavenly Master, we venture through boiling waters and scorching fires to humbly submit this memorial. With utmost trepidation and fear, we kowtow, acknowledging our capital offense.\n\nWe beseech the Most High, the Boundless Great Dao, the Three Master Lords: You love life and abhor death. We implore You to bestow the transformative power of the Great Dao. May the officials in charge distinguish the Five Phases, regulate the pitch-pipes, array the Eight Trigrams, and mark the months and solar terms, so that yang does not encroach upon its bounds, yin does not retreat from its proper measure. When the Five comes to rest upon the One, Water naturally moistens below; when the Five ascends to the Two, Fire naturally flames upward; when the Five rides upon the Three, Wood naturally bends and straightens; when the Five removes the Four, Metal congeals and transforms; when the Five pairs with itself, the Law nourishes crops. Only when the Five are complete does nothing fail to grow. Then may the *Chunhuo* constellation withdraw its flames, the *Xuanxiao* constellation release its moisture, the *Jisu* constellation pour forth its tongue, the *Bisu* constellation stir its roots. May the coarse stones of the Five Marchmounts and the surging springs of the Four Marshes burst forth.\n\nWe humbly implore Your celestial mercy. We reverently request that from the Lingtai Palace, one Han Ming Lord and one hundred twenty officials and generals be dispatched to command the celestial thunder. From the Yuanming Palace, one Xiao Xuan Ming Lord and one hundred twenty officials and generals be dispatched to command Lord Lü, Son of the River Earl; the Thirty-Six Water Emperors; the Twelve Stream Maidens; the Nine River Water Emperors; the subordinate officials of the River Pacification Marquis; and the Water Deities of the Central Region, to summon clouds and send down rain. From the Hetian Palace, one Jiuhai Beixuan Lord and one hundred twenty officials and generals be dispatched to send forth water qi and release wind and thunder. From the Taishan Palace, the Nine Valley Lords of Sizhou and one hundred twenty officials and generals be dispatched to raise water qi. We further request the Nine Sea Lords and Water Emperors of Sizhou, the Envoys of Floating Clouds, and one hundred ten officials and generals to descend together. May they join with the illustrious Earth Lord of this prefecture, county, and township; the spirits of the famous mountains and great marshes, the source-valleys and rivers; the ancient and present ministers and great officials who have rendered service to the people and are enshrined in temples; and all the Perfected Officials of villages, townships, hamlets, and wards. May they register the qi, transmit the talismans, and govern the temple offices. May all the divine lords descend, unite their hearts and strength, assist the Dao of Heaven, perform their numinous powers, summon clouds and send down rain, bestowing abundant moisture and copious soaking. May the parched seedlings receive the glory of fattening moisture; may the myriad people gain the Mandate of renewal.\n\nWhen the task is accomplished and the affair established, may their merits be reported and their ranks promoted. May the Lords of Wind and Rain likewise ascend to the Three Heavens to receive their due reward. We pray that the Celestial Bureau issue a decree to swiftly cause the drought demons to perish in accordance with this memorial. We specially beseech the Three Masters of the Most High to grant efficacy and verification, that we may not fail in our trust.\n\nMay the Most High, in Your discernment, have mercy upon our foolish inadequacy.\n\nWe respectfully entrust this to the Direct Envoys of the Two Officials, the Left and Right Official Envoys of the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Scribes of Yin-Yang Divine Formulas, the Charioteers of the Red Talisman Statutes, and the Courier Horses of the Strong Winds, two officials each, to carry forth.\n\nWe, Your servants, humbly memorialize on behalf of the parched and desiccated qi of this realm, fearing the failure of the hundred grains. We kowtow and beseech the Celestial Officials to descend in due season, bestowing flowing moisture and abundant soaking.\n\nOne precious memorial is hereby submitted to the Three Celestial Bureaus, awaiting Your decree.\n\nWe, Your servants, with utmost trepidation and fear, kowtow and bow our heads in reverence, submitting this for Your attention.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial to Cease Rain After Receiving Water**\n\n[Position the ritual implements.]\n\nWe humbly submit: According to the sacred writ, we, Your servants, have encountered this turning of the cosmic cycle and been privileged to receive the Master’s Dao, assisting the state and sustaining life. Recently, cold and heat have been unseasonable; demonic afflictions have multiplied. Since the beginning of yang, severe drought has persisted without rain. The people have neglected their agricultural duties; crops wither and parch. We, Your servants, grieve for the people’s distress and have beseeched the descent of clouds and rain. The vast moisture has poured forth in all directions; yin qi has descended without cease. Torrential rains have surged; the hundred rivers overflow. The people have abandoned their livelihoods; fields and seedlings are submerged. The court and the common folk suffer hardship.\n\nWe, Your servants, in accordance with ancient rites, humbly submit this memorial, praying that it may be conveyed above. We beseech that the rains be restrained.\n\nWe, Your servants, have previously consulted and reported to the Rain and Spring Officials, who have returned to the Heavenly Courts. The Central Officials have recorded and sealed the memorial, advancing to receive merit and reward. We now humbly request one Lord of Righteous Qi of Heaven, along with one hundred and twenty officials and generals, and one thousand two hundred Jade Maidens of the River, each to descend in unison. We beseech the Heavenly Courts to restrain the rains and shift the winds, that the Wind Earl and Rain Master may follow the four seasons and eight solar terms without error, gathering clouds and withdrawing obscuring vapors, so that the Three Luminaries may shine brightly—this being the sign to cease the rains. Let all officials report their merits to receive rewards, thereby demonstrating efficacy and trust.\n\nWe implore the Most High to discern and show mercy. As we, Your servants, have received the grace of the throne in our plea for rain, we now beseech its cessation. We humbly submit this memorial, to be conveyed to the [specific] Court. Awaiting the decree, we prostrate ourselves in reverence and awe, bowing our heads to the ground in submission.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial for the Suppression of Locusts, Rats, and Pestilence Devouring Seedlings**\n\n[Your servants] hold their ordained ranks and humbly submit:\n\nWe have respectfully examined the records, noting that on such-and-such a day, by fortunate encounter, we were granted the pure transformation of governance. Yet we, Your servants, have repeatedly incurred calamities and faults, and in recent years, our fields and sowings have seldom prospered as desired. This year, in such-and-such a place, the wild grain and planted crops have been devoured by plague locusts, which cannot be restrained. We beseech Your servants to perform exorcism and protection.\n\nProstrating ourselves, we humbly submit this memorial for Your attention, praying that one Lord of the Heavenly Fields of the Northern Gate, along with one hundred and twenty officials and generals, be dispatched to expel and eliminate all locusts, rats, and creatures that harm and violate the seedlings and crops of our household, causing all such vermin and pests to vanish entirely. We further request the Lord of the Heavenly Wilds of the Earth’s End Palace, with one hundred and twenty officials and generals, to descend and benefit the fields and labor, ensuring that roebucks, deer, birds, insects, rats, and all creatures may not inflict harm. We also beseech the Three Qi Lords of Yang Primacy, with one hundred and twenty officials and generals, to govern the Yellow Cloud Palace and seize the spirits of birds and beasts that violently damage the essence of grains and crops, preventing them from causing harm.\n\nMay the August Dao of the Void Sovereign, the local deities of the land, mountains, and forests, the Chief of Meng, the Twelve Stream Maidens, and the Lords of the Altars of Soil and Grain command that our fields yield double harvests, free from further calamity and loss. On the day our prayers are fulfilled, we shall not fail in demonstrating efficacy and trust.\n\nWe implore [Your boundless mercy].\n\nThe Most High shall discern. So forth.\n\nRespectfully, on such-and-such a day, we submit this memorial in worship, supplicating the Heavenly Officials: for this spring’s fieldwork, may the calamities of locusts and rats be entrusted to the qi of the Dao, that we may obtain protection. One precious memorial shall be presented to the Three Heavenly Bureaus, awaiting their decree and response.\n\nWe, your servants, in utmost reverence and awe, bow our heads in prostration to make this known.\n\n**Memorial for the Eradication of Rat Calamities**\n[Ritual positions duly arranged, memorial presented as follows:]\n\nIn accordance with the sacred writ, we, your servant [Name] and disciples, have long been humble tillers of the soil, our livelihood dependent on the fields, our descendants bound to the crops. For a thousand generations, we have been fortunate to serve the Great Dao, granted the honor of wearing the exalted registers, and bestowed with manifest offices of governance. The heavenly officials, clerks, and soldiers have been our defense. Yet our sins accumulate like mountains and seas, while our merits are thinner than a hair’s breadth. In repaying Heaven and Earth, we dare not rest at ease.\n\nIn our fields, rat calamities have wrought indiscriminate harm, beyond all restraint. Unable to bear the sight, we prostrate ourselves and submit this memorial, beseeching the Most High Dao, the Venerable Lords, the Three Master Lords, the Ladies, and the Heavenly Administrators to deign in their mercy to examine our plea.\n\nWe humbly supplicate the Three-Five Lords of Yang Primacy, with one hundred and twenty officials and generals, to govern the Yellow Cloud Palace. We further implore the White Tiger General of the Southern Mountains and his officers and soldiers to descend as one, capturing the field rats within our borders and driving them back to the wilderness, forbidding them to linger in grain-bearing lands.\n\nMay the local deities of our district—the Chief of Meng, the Twelve Stream Maidens, the Lords of the Altars of Soil and Grain, and the deities of the land, mountains, and forests—join in eradicating the scourge of rats, pacifying and extinguishing them in due time. Thus shall the five grains flourish abundantly, and the people rejoice in renewal, bearing the grace of the Dao’s life-nurturing virtue.\n\nWe shall not fail in demonstrating efficacy and trust. We implore the Most High to discern.\n\nA Memorial for the Removal of Tiger Calamities\n\nDuly occupying our ritual station, we humbly submit this memorial:\n\nAccording to the documents, we, born of womb and kin to the subordinate officers and descendants, have been blessed across a thousand generations to encounter the Great Transformation. We have received profound grace, long upheld the master’s Dao, and been bestowed the Celestial Master’s talismans and registers for our own protection. Such favor and radiance are truly excessive.\n\nYet now we face inauspicious calamity: tigers and wolves have entered our borders, devouring living people and harming the six livestock. Their ravages grow daily deeper, with no means to restrain them. We fear that the lives of our household—men and women—may fall into decline and adversity, ensnared in karmic nets, transgressing the manifold prohibitions: the Generals of the Great Year, the Year of Birth, the Life Destiny, the Twelve Taboos, the *fēishī* corpse-qi, the ghosts of drink and food, the mountain spirits and sea numina, the one hundred twenty spectral demons, and all those since the Most Ancient—such as the Generals of Inversion, the Generals of the Way, each invoking their official titles—along with the spirits of harm from the Five Directions and those who obstruct the roads. We beseech that none of these bring us affliction.\n\nWe implore the Northern Mysterious Lord, with one hundred twenty officers and generals, to govern the Black Bureau. We further implore the Northern Pacifying Guardian Lord, with one hundred twenty officers and generals, to govern the Red Bureau. Together may they descend, sealing our dwelling and precincts. May the true officials infuse their qi, overseeing and summoning the lords of mountains, rivers, altars of soil and grain, and local deities, that they may unite in purpose to dispel the harm of tigers and wolves.\n\nWe further implore the Lord of the Hundred Spirits in the Hidden Palace, with one hundred twenty officers and generals, to descend as one, seizing the essences of the hundred aged qi that bring misfortune to people. We implore the Earth-Restraining Lord, with one hundred twenty officers and generals, the Celestial Supervisor, the River Earl, the Water Thearch, and the Twelve Scribes, to capture and restrain the tigers and wolves of the Five Directions that slaughter all beings, along with the one hundred twenty blood-stained ghosts of harm, severing the qi of death and injury both within and without.\n\nWe implore the Lords of the Nine Yi, Eight Man, Six Rong, Five Di, and Three Qin, each according to their directional stations, in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, to join with the Three Generals of our household, the twenty-four officers, and three hundred thousand soldiers, diligently guarding and protecting. May all sentient beings be swept away. We pray that in our prefecture and county, our household—men and women, young and old—along with our oxen, horses, and six livestock, in all our comings and goings, may not encounter the calamities of tigers, wolves, and manifold disasters. May no poisonous harm cross this border, and may all receive complete protection.\n\nMay the generals, officers, and soldiers who demonstrate their efficacy be rewarded for their merit and labor. We shall not fail in demonstrating efficacy and trust. We implore the Most High to discern.\n\nWith utmost reverence, we perform the rite to expel malevolent beasts and present this memorial, submitting it to the Celestial Bureau of [Name]. Thus concluded.\n\n**Memorial for the Dissolution of Curses and Hexes**\nDuly inscribed with the proper ritual titles, we humbly address:\n\nIn accordance with the sacred writ, [Name] today declares in person: by a thousand-year fortune, I have been granted the honor of serving the Great Dao. Yet, being of humble and unworthy nature, my faith has often faltered, inviting the accumulation of baleful qi. Of late, my dwelling has been beset by misfortune; dreams assail me in confusion, and omens of ill portend without cease. My limbs grow heavy, my complexion withers, my spirit scatters, no longer bound to my form. Divination and inquiry reveal the presence of wicked persons who, through mutual malediction, invoke heaven and earth, summon ghosts and spirits, and employ a hundred forms of curses. Some inscribe my name, others craft effigies in my likeness; some pierce hearts with blades, others sever hair and fingers, offering them to the spirits of the land. I fear the hundred oath-bound ghosts now seize and detain me. I know not what merit may dissolve this, nor how to guard my life and body. With a sincere heart and offerings of utmost faith, I rely upon the Great Dao, beseeching the celestial ministers to receive my plea. I beg for this memorial to reverse and dissolve the curses.\n\nProstrate, I present this memorial to the Celestial Bureau, praying that the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Venerable One, the Three Master Lords, the Ladies, and the Attendant Scribes of the Gate deign to attend, examine, and act. If the curses and hexes were cast in the spring months of yin, mao, and chen against my person, I invoke the Lords of the Nine Yi of the East, Jia and Yi, to reverse and dissolve them. If cast in the summer months of si, wu, and wei, I invoke the Lords of the Eight Man of the South, Bing and Ding, to reverse and dissolve them. If cast in the autumn months of shen, you, and xu, I invoke the Lords of the Six Rong of the West, Geng and Xin, to reverse and dissolve them. If cast in the winter months of hai, zi, and chou, I invoke the Lords of the Five Di of the North, Ren and Gui, to reverse and dissolve them. If cast in the intercalary months, may the Lords of the Three Qin of the Center, Wu and Ji, dispel and dissolve them. If the curses were cast under the twenty-eight constellations, may the Lords of the corresponding stellar lodges reverse and dissolve them. If wicked persons have crafted effigies or pierced hearts with blades, or if the curses were placed at roadside shrines, altars, prisons, sacred trees, well spirits, hearth deities, or in the domains of the River Earls, water officials, or the private spirits of heretical masters, we humbly note: the Most High is pure and exalted, the Three Heavens vast and distant, the upright qi eternal, while the perverse qi runs rampant, wrongfully harming the innocent—of whom I am but one. I fear that, unjustly ensnared, I may suddenly be claimed by the ghostly officials. I beseech the Great Dao of the Most High, Lord Lao, the Venerable One, the Heavenly Masters, the Lady Masters, the Three Master Lords, the Ladies, the Attendant Scribes, and the True Lords of the Five Qi to attend and consider. If I have transgressed the Five Oaths or the Seven Curses, I implore the million soldiers of the Supreme Prime and the hundred thousand soldiers of the Lords of Reversal to descend as one. For my sake, release the three hun and seven po, that they may not be detained; restore my hun and restrain my po, harmonizing my spirit and qi. Dissolve the thousand evils and ten thousand ghosts within my body, that they may never again disturb me. May all malevolent spirits and curses be utterly swept away. May the celestial officials I have invoked act in accordance with my words, rewarding merit and promotion. I entreat that the efficacy of this rite be manifest in my dwelling, as a sign of trust and favor. We implore the Most High to discern. Thus concluded.\n\nMay the Most High discern and distinguish. *Thus concluded.*\n\n**Petition for the Dissolution of Malevolent Manifestations**\n\nHaving assumed the proper ritual position, I humbly submit this memorial:\n\nIn accordance with the sacred writ, I, [Name], do this day declare in my own words: born of the womb, a descendant of the lower officials and their progeny, I have been blessed across a thousand generations to serve the Great Dao. From of old, I have received boundless grace, my sincerity unceasing.\n\nYet of late, my dwelling has known no peace; malevolent spirits stir and disturb, and wherever I turn, misfortune prevails, with inauspicious omens appearing in succession. On this day, I suddenly beheld a manifestation of [describe] hue, which unfolded script and inscribed characters, filling me with no small distress.\n\nI beseech the granting of one *Petition for the Dissolution of a Hundred Malevolent Manifestations*, humbly imploring its transmission to the Three Heavenly Bureaus.\n\nIn accordance with the ritual statutes, I, your disciple [Name], having investigated the ominous portents afflicting my household, now submit this petition. By the prescribed method, I offer one hundred and twenty feet of *mang* rope, a blade, and the five directional ritual pledges—coin, rice, and *ming* silk—along with one *Petition for the Dissolution of Malevolent Manifestations in the Five Directions*, reverently presented. May the Most High and Boundless Dao, the Three Masters, and the host of sages deign to bestow their compassionate regard.\n\nI humbly aver:\nIn the East, the azure malevolence styles itself the Year Star, wantonly conjuring baleful manifestations. The essence of ancient trees, it stirs and manifests as green objects, inflicting widespread harm. I beseech the Azure Emperor of the East to dissolve and annihilate this malevolent calamity.\n\nIn the South, the crimson malevolence styles itself Mars, stirring and manifesting as red objects, seeking to inflict harm. May the Vermilion Emperor of the South dissolve and annihilate this malevolent calamity.\n\nIn the West, the white malevolence styles itself Venus, stirring and manifesting as white objects, intent on rebellion and treachery, wantonly producing strange anomalies. I beseech the White Emperor of the West to dissolve and annihilate this malevolent calamity.\n\nIn the North, the black malevolence styles itself Mercury, the essence of spring sources and tortoises, stirring and manifesting as black objects, altering names and forms. I beseech the Black Emperor of the North to dissolve and annihilate this malevolent manifestation.\n\nIn the Center, the yellow malevolence styles itself Saturn, stirring and manifesting as yellow objects, falsely claiming kinship, summoning inauspicious forces, and conjuring manifold anomalies. I beseech the Yellow Emperor of the Center to eradicate and annihilate this malevolent calamity.\n\nIn accordance with the *Petition of the Celestial Master to the One Thousand Two Hundred Officials*, I hereby memorialize and invoke:\n- The Lord of Heavenly Prosperity, with one hundred thousand yellow-robed soldiers;\n- The Lord Supervisor, with one million soldiers;\n- Five Lords of the Supreme Prime, each attended by one hundred and twenty officers.\n\nMay they descend to my household to apprehend and seize the one hundred and twenty malevolent manifestations, sweeping them away in a single stroke, dissolving and annihilating them. May the essences of the ancient ones and all past transgressions be graciously pardoned and absolved.\n\nMay the celestial officials I have invoked act in accordance with the words of the Three Assemblies, rewarding merit without fail. I implore the Most High to discern. *Thus concluded.*\n\nPetitioning for the Five Directions’ Great Petition to Dissolve Malevolent Manifestations, submitted to the Celestial Bureau:\n\nTo dispel calamity, avert misfortune, prolong life, deliver destiny, and repel slaughter—thus the memorial is presented.\n\nIn accordance with the scriptures, I, your humble servant, now declare in my own words: Born of the womb, a descendant of the lower officials’ lineage, I have been blessed across a thousand generations to serve the Great Dao and have long received its grace. Yet in this present year, upon reckoning my fate, I find disasters and adversities manifold, lacking the fortune to sustain myself. Relying solely upon my sincerity, I beseech through this petition to deliver myself and attain peace in my dwelling.\n\nI humbly implore the Three Luminaries’ Perfected Officials to resolve and dissolve the celestial nets and earthly snares of this year, the wandering red rats of the city walls, the three mounds and five graves, the baleful stars of punishment and slaughter—all poised to bring misfortune. May they turn and shield my life, extending my years, dissolving disasters, and delivering me from adversity.\n\nI reverently present *The Petition for Protection*, to be heard by the celestial officials of the Heavenly Bureau. May they spread and infuse the qi of the Dao into my body. I invoke:\n- The Five Perfected Lords of Supreme Harmony and Love of Life,\n- The Five Lords of Qi Circulation,\n- The Five Lords of Deliverance from Punishment and Adversity,\n- The Five Lords of Life Extension and Year Augmentation,\n- The Five Lords of Life Preservation and Destiny Protection,\n- The Venerable Lord of Myriad Blessings,\n- The Lord of Heavenly Prosperity within the Celestial Palace, with one hundred thousand yellow-robed soldiers.\n\nI further invoke:\n- The Five Lords of Punishment Collection and Slaughter Repulsion,\n- The Five Lords of Execution and Slaughter Severance,\n- The Five Lords of Punishment Enforcement and Slaughter Seizure,\neach attended by one hundred and twenty officers, to safeguard my body from the hundred malevolent punishments and adversities. From the first adversity to the ninth, may all be delivered, turning death into rebirth, dissolving disasters, dispersing misfortune, and transforming ill fortune into good.\n\nAdditionally, for the perils of:\n- Robbery Slaughter, Calamity Slaughter, Heavenly Slaughter, Earthly Slaughter,\n- Year Slaughter, Month Slaughter, Day Slaughter, Hour Slaughter,\n- Yin Slaughter, Yang Slaughter, the Three Slaughters of Baleful Stars, the Five Punishments, and the Six Livestock,\nall poised to bring malevolent afflictions, I invoke:\n- The Five Lords of Myriad Blessings,\n- The Five Lords of Qi Circulation,\n- The Five Lords of Adversity Dissolution,\n- The Southern Director of Destiny,\n- The Radiant Star Lord of Venus,\n- The Lords of Soul Restraint and Spirit Control,\n- The Lords of Wealth and Prosperity,\n- The Lords of Destiny’s Jade Register,\neach attended by one hundred and twenty officers, to strike my name from the Register of Death and inscribe it in the Register of Life.\n\nIn accordance with the Mysterious Statutes, I offer as ritual payment:\n- one bolt of plain silk,\n- one thousand two hundred coins,\n- one *dou* and two *sheng* of oil,\n- one *shi* and two *dou* of rice,\n- paper, brushes, incense, and fruit,\npresented to the Ten Directions’ Numinous Officials. May they repel and expel demonic forces, nurture and protect my life, and may the Celestial Officials and Holy Mothers universally grant their favor.\n\nI further earnestly invoke:\n- The Lords of the Nine Yi of the East, with eighty-one officials,\n- The Lords of the Yin, Mao, Chen, Jia, and Yi directions,\nto dissolve for me the green disasters, green adversities, green pestilences, green poisons, green convulsions, and green slaughters of the East.\n\n- The Lords of the Eight Man of the South, with sixty-four officials,\n- The Lords of the Si, Wu, Wei, Bing, and Ding directions,\nto dissolve for me the red disasters, red adversities, red pestilences, red poisons, red convulsions, and red slaughters of the South.\n\n- The Lords of the Six Rong of the West, with thirty-six officials,\n- The Lords of the Shen, You, Xu, Geng, and Xin directions,\nto dissolve for me the white disasters, white adversities, white pestilences, white poisons, white convulsions, and white slaughters of the West.\n\n- The Lords of the Five Di of the North, with twenty-five officials,\n- The Lords of the Hai, Zi, Chou, Ren, and Gui directions,\nto dissolve for me the black disasters, black adversities, black pestilences, black poisons, black inflictions, and black slaughters of the North.\n\n- The Lords of the Three Qin of the Center, with one thousand two hundred officials,\nto dissolve for me the yellow disasters, yellow adversities, yellow pestilences, yellow poisons, yellow convulsions, and yellow slaughters of the Center.

By the grace of my teachers and elders, I have received honors, been granted talismans and registers for self-discipline, advanced to the Middle Vehicle, and borne the weight of their trust. Entrusted with the office of governance, I have upheld the scriptures and treasures of the Dao. The boundless grace of such favor is beyond measure.\n\nYet I, your servant, am dull-witted, my spirit and qi unsettled, my three *hun* souls unguarded, my seven *po* souls restless. In utmost reverence and fear, I bow my head and prostrate myself before the August Jade Emperor.\n\nI and my seven generations of ancestors have committed hidden sins and manifest transgressions, accumulating the guilt of killing and harming living beings, all recorded by the Three Officials. From this day forward, I beseech that my ten thousand transgressions be dissolved, my sins erased, malevolent qi annihilated, and the nine blessings perpetually secure. May the souls of my seven generations of ancestors, down to my distant descendants, ascend and be reborn, returning to the womb as infants.\n\nMay I, your servant, attain the longevity of the immortals, eternal life in the Great Void, and bow to the Jade Purity of the North.\n\nIn utmost reverence and fear, I bow my head and prostrate myself before the Three Primordial Lords of the Great Simplicity.\n\nI and my seven generations of ancestors, down to myself, have committed hidden sins and manifest transgressions, the guilt of killing living beings, all recorded before the Emperor. From this day forward, I beseech that my sins be erased, death struck from the records and life inscribed, my ten thousand transgressions dissolved. May my seven generations of ancestors return to the Jade Court, ascend to the sun and moon, and wander among the seven stars.\n\nI, your servant, bow my head and prostrate myself before the Three Pure Ones of the Supreme Clarity.\n\nSince the dawn of my awareness, I have committed a thousand sins and ten thousand transgressions, extending to the hidden evils of my seven generations of ancestors, all recorded by the Three Officials. From this day forward, I beseech that my ten thousand sins be dissolved, deceit and malevolence eradicated, hidden sins scattered, my seven generations of ancestors restored to spirit, my body ascend to the Emperor’s Hall, and my path return to the Jade Court.\n\nI, your servant, in utmost reverence and awe, bow my head and prostrate myself before the Four Elder Lords of the Dao-Middle.\n\nSince seven generations past, extending to my seven generations of ancestors, the hidden rebellions and accumulated evils we have committed—all recorded by the Three Yin Officials—I beseech that from this day forward, my thousand sins be scattered and dissolved, my ten thousand transgressions overturned and erased, my hun and po souls made distinct, my seven generations of ancestors returned to the womb of rebirth, the ten thousand spirits attend as guardians, the Five Elders establish my talisman, my lifespan equal that of Heaven and Earth, and my name and form inscribed in the Jade Register.\n\nI, your servant, in utmost reverence and awe, bow my head and prostrate myself before the Three Bureau Lords.\n\nMay from this day onward, the knots of my sins be untangled and dispersed, the qi of my transgressions vanish, the hundred evils never arise, perverse qi be concealed and severed, my seven generations of ancestors ascend as immortals, my three hun souls harmonized and refined, my seven po souls bound in purity, and the multitude of spirits support and attend me, that I may become an Upper Perfected.\n\nI, your servant, in utmost reverence and awe, bow my head and prostrate myself.\n\nWithin are seven sections of similar wording, which are not transcribed here, as the original submission is thus.\n\nI, your humble servant, born in this thousand-year turning of the cosmic wheel, have been permitted to dwell at the end of the Dao and, though unworthy, have received the office of governance. Yet I am dull-witted, raised in the common stream, my offenses piled high as mountains and seas, with no self-awareness. Clinging to life and desiring its pleasures, I rise early and retire late, never settling my breath.\n\nI humbly implore the transforming grace of the Most High, whose beneficence extends without limit, to embrace even the foolish among the people, and to bestow the method of dissolving sins. Though my person is lowly and my Dao shallow, I dare to approach the pure and solemn, presenting this memorial in gratitude. My five emotions tremble in awe, my liver and heart feel rent asunder.\n\nI specially beseech the Dao Lord to grant the mercy of the Three Pardons, to take pity on my earnest sincerity, and further to bestow the daily renewal of Dao-qi, that all I attain may flow unimpeded, every endeavor succeed as my heart desires, my household flourish, and all within—great and small—receive your grace, as a token of my devotion.\n\nMay the Most High Great Dao Lord deign to consider this.\n\n---\n\nSuch being the case, and with the collective endorsement of the assembled officials, your servant reverently bows and presents this memorial to the Great Dao of the Three Heavens, humbly expressing gratitude for the years of this body’s existence. For seven generations past, and for the Three Masters of this present life, for parents living and deceased, for hidden sins and manifest transgressions, I beseech the gift of long life and the eternal preservation of the Water of Life.\n\nOne memorial is herewith respectfully submitted, to be conveyed to the Three Heavenly Courts of the Most High, prostrating in reverence to make this known. The *Feidu Jiu’e Tianluo Zhang* is presented in full accordance with its ritual rank, and the memorial states as follows:\n\nAt such-and-such a palace lies the severance of fate; at such-and-such a palace, the destiny of this life; and on such-and-such a taboo day in such-and-such a month and year, there is fear of entanglement in the celestial net, of encirclement by the earthly snare—only terror is known, no distinction made. With undivided devotion, I rely upon the ritual codes of the Heavenly Master of the Great Dao and, on behalf of the Li family, reverently present the *Feidu Jiu’e Tianluo Zhang*. I have prepared one hundred twenty feet of blue silk, one hundred twenty counting rods, one *shi* and two *dou* of life-bestowing rice, one bolt of plain silk, one thousand two hundred coins, and incense, oil, paper, and brushes, all to petition for the *Zhang* of deliverance and liberation from calamities.\n\nI humbly invoke the Lords of the Nine Yi of the East, the nine months of spring—*yin*, *mao*, *chen*, *jia*, *yi*—and the eighty-one official lords of the Nine Nines; the Lords of the Eight Man of the South, the three months of summer—*si*, *wu*, *wei*, *bing*, *ding*—and the sixty-four official lords of the Eight Eights; the Lords of the Six Rong of the West, the three months of autumn—*shen*, *you*, *xu*, *geng*, *xin*—and the thirty-six official lords of the Six Sixes; the Lords of the Five Di of the North, the three months of winter—*hai*, *zi*, *chou*, *ren*, *gui*—and the twenty-five official lords of the Five Fives. May each deign to descend to the altar, unite in purpose and strength, and eradicate the calamities of this household.\n\nI further invoke the Great General of Life Extension, with one thousand two hundred soldiers, to descend as one and, for the disciples—both male and female—prolong their years, support them through decline and adversity, eternally safeguard their primordial auspiciousness, and ensure the year’s end without misfortune, as a token of devotion.\n\nMay the grace of the Most High—\n\nThe Most High makes distinctions. Thus it is said. For [the petitioner], unbind the calamities and peril, and ascend through the Nine Perils of the Celestial Net, presenting one chapter of the *Feidu Jiu’e Tianluo*. It is submitted to the [Petitioner’s] Court with a single summons of stone.\n\nThe *Que Sanzai* chapter is presented in full ritual position, and the memorial states: Thus it is said. Since the [specified] month and day, [the petitioner] has been afflicted with illness and suffering. Thus it is said. Upon the master’s examination, it is found that the year and fate are inauspicious. Within the reckoning of the Nine Palaces and the flying tally of the *yuanchen* calendar, there is a convergence of opposing calculations, now exhausted. Moreover, both public and private matters, disputes and slander, water and fire, tigers and wolves, insects and serpents—all manifold perils—cling to the body. Some are this year’s *jiesha*, others next year’s *zaisha*; some are the *niansha*, *yuesha*, *risha*, or *shisha*, or the *yinchen* killer. There are the Five Directions’ slayers: the Green Slayer of the East, the Red Slayer of the South, the White Slayer of the West, the Black Slayer of the North, and the Yellow Slayer of the Center. One also fears entanglement in the Celestial Net and Earthly Web, dreading sudden harm without escape, causing great and small to tremble in terror, with no recourse.\n\nThus, considering the Nine Perils of the year—first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth—the perils of tigers, wolves, blades, and weapons; the perils of bandits and corvée; the perils of the Three Punishments and Three Slayers—I now invoke the Lord of Deliverance from Peril, the Lord of Life’s Stability, the Lord of Longevity, the Lord of Life’s Augmentation, the Lord of Life’s Continuance, the Lord of Deliverance and Life Extension, and the Lord of Great Fortune and Virtue. Each is accompanied by one hundred twenty officials and generals.\n\nI further invoke the August Heavenly Thearch, the Canopy of Sun and Moon, the Lords of the Northern Dipper, the Three Heavens’ Record-Keeping Lords of Fate, and the Marshal of Deliverance from Peril. Together with the directly attending Merit Officers, they descend to govern the hundred illnesses within [the petitioner’s] abdomen. The Orthodox Unity Merit Officer descends to govern the hundred illnesses within the heart. The Illness-Treating Merit Officer descends to govern the hundred illnesses within the spleen. The *Qi*-Directing Merit Officer descends to govern the hundred illnesses within the stomach. The Central Region Merit Officer descends to govern the hundred illnesses within the liver. The Yang Spirit Deciding Clerk descends to govern the hundred illnesses beneath the left armpit. The Yin Spirit Deciding Clerk descends to govern the hundred illnesses beneath the right armpit. The Wolf and Tiger Guards descend to govern the hundred illnesses within the intestines. The Inspector of Treachery descends to govern the hundred illnesses within the lungs. The Hook-Riding Lord descends to govern the hundred illnesses within the lower abdomen. The Three Officials’ Archers descend to govern the hundred illnesses within the back and spine. The Celestial Armored Soldiers descend to govern the hundred illnesses within the twenty fingers. The Celestial *Ding* Warriors descend to govern the hundred illnesses within the head and brain.\n\nMay all these maladies be eradicated and cured.\n\nGeneral Wang Wenqing of *Jiazi*, leading thirty-six thousand soldiers, stands guard to the left and right, defending until *you*. General Zhan Zijiang of *Jiaxu*, leading thirty-six thousand soldiers, stands guard to the left and right, defending until *wei*. General Hu Wenchang of *Jiashen*, leading twenty-six thousand soldiers, stands guard to the left and right, defending until *si*. General Wei Shangqing of *Jiawu*, leading thirty-six thousand soldiers, stands guard to the left and right, defending until *mao*. General Meng Feiqing of *Jiachen*, leading thirty-six thousand soldiers, stands guard to the left and right, defending until *chou*. General Ming Wenzhang of *Jiayin*, leading thirty-six thousand soldiers, stands guard to the left and right, defending until *hai*.\n\nThe Six *Jia* Generals, with their six divisions of troops, each leading thirty-six thousand soldiers, transmit and coordinate in timely succession, following the petitioner’s body through east and west, south and north, in motion and stillness. True spirits provide protection, standing guard and defending, dissolving the petitioner’s calamities and perils, repelling and extinguishing pestilent *qi*, prolonging the years of life, ensuring the household’s peace and prosperity, and granting repose to kin and dependents—all by the vast virtue of the Great Dao.\n\nThe celestial officials and laboring lords, having deigned to descend, shall on the three auspicious assembly days of the year have their merits memorialized in full. They shall be promoted in rank, their emoluments increased, and their rewards elevated, in fulfillment of this pledge of devotion.\n\nInvoking the boundless grace of the Most High,\n\nA petition for deliverance from illness, calamity, and mortal peril—one document—is hereby submitted to the celestial bureaus.\n\nA writ of exorcism, inscribed on azure silk with the remnants of sacred script, is presented in proper ritual form, proclaiming: From birth, this petitioner, a descendant of the earthly officials and a child of posterity, has been blessed across a thousand generations.\n\nYet of late, misfortune has clung to this body, and in this year of advancing fate, the petitioner humbly offers precious tokens of faith: forty feet of white silk to secure deliverance from calamity; one *shi* and two *dou* of rice to double provisions and augment life’s allotment, filling the granary’s measures; one thousand two hundred *wen* in coin to attest sincerity, stabilizing the three hundred sixty spirits and *qi*, ensuring their palaces grow daily more secure.\n\nBrush, ink, paper, and counting rods record the petitioner’s name for rebirth. Five effigies are cast to ascend in the petitioner’s stead to the five directions, transforming form and altering name. Fragrant oil and lamps maintain unbroken illumination. These offerings of rice and coin serve as pledges of sincerity, redeeming and ransoming this life.\n\nThe petitioner now invokes: twelve Lords of Deliverance from the Most High’s palace; twelve Lords of Life Extension; five Maidens of the Tripod Granary; five Lords of Destiny; one thousand two hundred Jade Maidens of the Five Planetary Palaces; one Lord of the Hall of Light; one Lord of Southern Prosperity; one Lord of Vermilion Yang; one Lord of the Yellow and the Old; one Lord of the Celestial Soul and one of the Earthly Spirit; one thousand two hundred Maidens of Revitalization; one thousand two hundred Maidens of the Jade Calendar; one hundred twenty officials each from the celestial, terrestrial, and water bureaus; and all summoned lords and functionaries of the various offices—may they unite in purpose and strength to deliver this disciple from the trials of fate, ensuring dwelling and abode remain peaceful, stable, and free from harm.\n\nAs pledged, the merits of the invoked celestial officials shall be memorialized on the three auspicious assembly days, their ranks elevated on propitious dates, in fulfillment of this vow of devotion.\n\nInvoking once more the boundless grace of the Most High.\n\n**Memorial for the Treatment of Illness**\n\nIn proper ritual rank, this memorial respectfully states:\n\nAs previously reported, this disciple has recently fallen ill, fearing drowning upon the path of life. Humbly approaching this minister, I beseech a memorial be presented to the Three Celestial Bureaus, praying for deliverance and redemption.\n\nFor some ten days now, cold and heat have been unbalanced, the pores disordered. Perhaps exposed to drafts or external chill, this illness was thus contracted—or perhaps by the Five Punishments and Three Calamities, a karmic retribution. Yet in my ignorance and obstruction, I know not how to examine and remedy this.\n\nI now invoke the generative qi of the Five Directions to aid in healing. With special reverence, I beseech the Most High and Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Lords and Venerable Ones, the Celestial Master Lord, the Three Master Lords, the Lady, the Compassionate Father, and the Holy Mother—to bestow grace and mindfulness, granting the Dao’s qi to shield and respond to this disciple’s body.\n\nRespectfully, I petition the Celestial Bureau, presenting to the Heavenly Physicians and the Twelve Lords of the Grand Physicians, that they descend to this disciple’s body and, wherever the illness resides, administer healing. I invoke the Fifteen Merit Officers for the Treatment of Illness to beseech the Celestial Bureau, erasing the roots of this disciple’s transgressions from past and present lives. May the five viscera, the four limbs, and the hundred vessels all receive cure and recovery.\n\nNext, I invoke the Eastern Blue Generative Qi, the Southern Red Generative Qi, the Western White Generative Qi, the Northern Black Generative Qi, and the Central Yellow Generative Qi—all to descend into this disciple’s body.\n\nFurthermore, I invoke the Lord of Release from Tribulation, the Lord of Life-Deliverance, the Lord of Lifespan Augmentation, the Lord of People’s Protection, the Lord of Calamity’s Punishment, the Great General of the Wandering Net, and the Great General of Earthly Boundaries—each to seize evil spirits, stale qi, and plague-demons, that the afflicted may be restored to health.\n\nThe celestial officials thus invoked shall have their merits memorialized on the three auspicious assembly days, their ranks elevated on propitious dates, in fulfillment of this vow of devotion. With gratitude, I reverently distinguish the grace of the Most High.\n\n**Petition for the Eradication of Disease, Expulsion of Calamitous Evil, and Protection of Life**\n\nIn due observance of ritual protocol, this memorial is respectfully submitted:\n\nWhereas this disciple suffers from grave and grievous illness, I humbly submit this urgent petition, beseeching the submission of a memorial. For the transgressions and karmic entanglements I have incurred are profound. Relying upon the great Dao, should compassionate aid be granted, I implore that my lifespan be extended and my illness cured this very day.\n\nWith reverence, I invoke the Yin-Yang Healing Merit Officers and the Five Officials of Medicine to proceed to the Phoenix Celestial Palace, within the Solar Gate, and there procure the Five-Colored Divine Medicines of the Great Purity. May these be poured into my mouth, flowing through the hundred vessels, filling my abdomen and chest, that all chronic ailments may dissolve and heal.\n\nThe Wood Official shall administer the medicine; the Fire Official shall preside over moxibustion; the Metal Official shall wield the needle; the Water Official shall prepare the decoction; the Earth Official shall harmonize the formulas—each attending to their appointed task. May the nine orifices align in harmony, the five viscera flow unimpeded, and the six bowels achieve balance.\n\nI further invoke the Lord of Harmonious Longevity, the Lord of Supreme Harmony, the Lord of the Great Yang, the Lord of Lifespan Extension, the Lord of Life Protection, the Lord of Tribulation’s Passage, the Five Thearchs’ Elder, and the Lord of Primal Qi. Additionally, I summon the Great General of the Lofty Standard, along with three hundred thousand troops of the Reversed Armor and Inverted Scales, to descend and purge the evil spirits from my five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, joints, twelve palaces, and one hundred twenty barriers and mechanisms.\n\nShould any evil spirits remain bound to my body, I petition the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water; the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways; the Mountain and Forest Elders; and the Twenty-Four Taboos—all to join with the Riding Officers of the Crimson Heaven’s Fierce Wind, whom I bear upon my person, in the capture of these malevolent spirits.\n\nMoreover, I entreat the Lord of Myriad Blessings, the Lord of the Celestial Granary, the Lord of the Eastern Blue Qi, the Lord of the Southern Red Qi, the Lord of the Western White Qi, the Lord of the Northern Black Qi, and the Lord of the Central Yellow Qi—each to lead their legions and descend into my body to expel all perverse qi.\n\nMay I be restored to health, my life prolonged, and my well-being preserved without mishap. Should this petition be fulfilled, the merits of the celestial officials thus invoked shall be memorialized on the three auspicious assembly days, their ranks elevated in due course, in fulfillment of this vow of devotion. With gratitude, I reverently distinguish the grace of the Most High.\n\nFor my afflicted body, stricken with grave illness and confined to bed, I reverently present this *Memorial for Life-Prolonging Protection*, submitting it to the [Celestial] Bureau of [N.N.]. Herein lies the *Memorial for Support in Decline and Deliverance from Calamity*, duly inscribed with its ritual rank and addressed as follows:\n\nI, [N.N.], unworthy heir to a minor official’s lineage, was formed through the six qi and owe my existence to ten thousand kalpas of good fortune. Bathed in the radiance of the Three Luminaries, I dwell in this extraordinary age and have been granted a place among humankind. Yet this year, my misfortunes run deep, and the days stretch long; even my constancy and blessings are imperiled. I have heard that the Great Dao, in its boundless grace, rescues the common people, reviving withered bones and restoring the dead to life. Having received this immeasurable mercy, I am profoundly grateful.\n\nShould my calamity lie within the Eastern Celestial Prison, I entreat the Azure Emperor of the East, Lord of Jia-Yi and the Nine Yi Tribes, along with his retinue of eighty-one officials, to mount the Azure Dragon, traverse ten thousand leagues, and wield their tablets and talismans to dissolve for me the azure disasters, azure calamities, azure pestilences, azure misfortunes, and azure poisons of the East. May all baleful qi of the three spring months be utterly swept away.\n\nShould my calamity lie within the Southern Celestial Prison, I entreat the Vermilion Emperor of the South, Lord of Bing-Ding and the Eight Man Tribes, along with his retinue of sixty-four officials, to mount the Vermilion Dragon, traverse ten thousand leagues, and wield their tablets and talismans to dissolve for me the vermilion disasters, vermilion calamities, vermilion pestilences, vermilion misfortunes, and vermilion poisons of the South. May all baleful qi of the three summer months be utterly swept away.\n\nShould my calamity lie within the Western Celestial Prison, I entreat the White Emperor of the West, Lord of Geng-Xin and the Six Rong Tribes, along with his retinue of thirty-six officials, to mount the White Dragon, traverse ten thousand leagues, and wield their tablets and talismans to dissolve for me the white disasters, white calamities, white pestilences, white misfortunes, and white poisons of the West. May all baleful qi of the three autumn months be utterly swept away.\n\nShould my calamity lie within the Northern Celestial Prison, I entreat the Black Emperor of the North, Lord of Ren-Gui and the Five Di Tribes, along with his retinue of twenty-five officials, to mount the Black Dragon, traverse ten thousand leagues, and wield their tablets and talismans to dissolve for me the black disasters, black calamities, black pestilences, black misfortunes, and black poisons of the North. May all baleful qi of the three winter months be utterly swept away.\n\nShould my calamity lie within the Central Celestial Prison, I entreat the Yellow Emperor of the Center, Lord of Wu-Ji and the Three Qin Tribes, along with his retinue of nine thousand two hundred officials, to mount the Yellow Dragon, traverse ten thousand leagues, and wield their tablets and talismans to dissolve for me the yellow disasters, yellow calamities, yellow pestilences, yellow misfortunes, and yellow poisons of the Center. May all calamities from the first to the ninth, and all eight adversities afflicting my body, be dispelled.\n\nFurthermore, I entreat the August Heavenly Thearch, the Sun and Moon and Five Planets, the Five Thearchs and their Ministers, the Lord of the Canopy and Northern Dipper, and the Lords of the Three Heavens’ Registers and Life-Commands to descend as one and dissolve for me the three disasters and nine calamities, as well as this year’s pestilential miasmas and jaundiced vapors, driving them far from body and mind.\n\nToday, I offer in devotion: one bolt of white silk, one *shi* and two *dou* of rice, one thousand two hundred cash coins, twelve *sheng* of oil, and incense, lamps, paper, and brushes as tokens of my sincerity. By this offering, I pledge my unwavering faith.\n\nI reverently petition the Most High of the Three Heavens to erase my name from the Register of the Dead and inscribe it in the Register of the Living, excising all afflictions of the myriad illnesses. May my household enjoy peace, may the Dao’s power sustain me, and may my office and salary be advanced. On the day this grace is bestowed, may the celestial officials and their legions, in accordance with the three auspicious assembly days, be duly rewarded for their merits, and may this vow of devotion not be in vain.\n\nWith gratitude, I reverently distinguish the grace of the Most High.\n\nI prostrate and present one memorial, the *Petition to the Celestial Officials for Support in Declining Years and Deliverance from Calamity*, to be conveyed to the respective bureaus. The *Memorial of Gratitude to the Earth Deities* is hereby submitted, detailing the following:\n\nOf late, my dwelling has been inauspicious, attracting misfortune and adversity. Within this residence, the earth spirits and local deities have pursued and held me accountable. I know not what meritorious deeds to perform to safeguard my household. With wholehearted devotion, I rely upon the Great Dao. I humbly beseech memorials to be presented to the Three Heavenly Bureaus, praying that the presiding officials may, in due time, review and attend to this matter.\n\nI reverently petition the Five Lords of Gratitude to the Earth, the Five Lords of Earth Regulation, the Five Lords of Earth Appeasement, the Five Lords of Earth Stabilization, and the Five Lords of Dwelling Pacification, along with their one hundred twenty attendant officers, to collectively descend and absolve my household of offenses against the deities of the five directions and the myriad earth spirits. Since the establishment of this dwelling, whether in recent or past times, I have dug and excavated, moved fences and replaced pillars, constructed buildings, commenced earthworks, leveled high ground and filled low, altered gates and doors, transgressed the taboos of the Six Jia, disturbed the myriad spirits of tiles and stones, the hidden corpses and concealed remains, copper and iron, white earth, black earth, and yellow earth, the Earth Sovereigns and Earth Kings, the Earth Ministers and Earth Palaces, the Generals of Earth, the Earth Lords, the Lords of the Earth Below, the Two Thousand Stone Officials, the Yin Earth and Yang Earth, the Four Seasons and Five Phases, the Great Central Sovereign, the front and back of the dwelling, the left and right of the dwelling, the Five Earth Spirit Kings, the Directors of the Central Courtyard, the Gate-Attending Gentlemen, the Gate Sergeants and Door Guards, the spirits of wells and privies, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior, the Soaring Serpent and Hidden Dragon, the Year Star, the Grand Yin, the Grand Yang, the Director of Destiny, the officers of the twelve hours, the Celestial Rigidity and Grand Unity, the Victorious and Lesser Auspices, the Conveying and Following Chief, the River Chief, the Ascending Clarity and Divine Successor, the Great Auspice and Merit Clerk, the Grand Assault, the Restraining Punishment, the Breaking and Killing spirits within the earth, the true numina of the four first months, four middle months, and four last months, the *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* hours, the Gate of Heaven and Door of Earth.\n\nFor offenses against the earth deities of the eastern direction, absolution is sought at the *Zhen* Palace. For offenses against the earth deities of the southern direction, absolution is sought at the *Li* Palace.\n\nFor offenses against the earth deities of the western direction, absolution is sought at the *Dui* Palace. For offenses against the earth deities of the northern direction, absolution is sought at the *Kan* Palace. For offenses against the earth deities of the central direction, absolution is sought at the *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, and *Xun* Palaces, and all are granted pardon and amnesty.\n\nO Guardian Deities of this dwelling, Yanzi and Dai the Great, with threefold roofing and threefold shelter from rain, to the east, west, south, and north, may all perverse spirits, lingering *qi*, and every misfortune and harm be swept away at once. May this household, young and old, forever enjoy primordial auspiciousness.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Most High to discern and distinguish. We implore mercy.\n\nSince the construction of this dwelling, we have unwittingly transgressed against the dwelling deities and the earth lords’ prohibitions, incurring mutual pursuit and reproach. We reverently present this petition of absolution and expiation, one document, to ascend to the Three Heavenly Bureaus.\n\n**Petition to Dispel Depleting Ghosts**\nDuly recording the ritual rank,\nFrom the High Antiquity: ...\n\nYet in this household, quarrels arise without cause, and servants flee or rebel, all due to the depletion and haunting of malevolent ghosts. We earnestly invoke the Five-Fortune Celestial Officials, the Twelve Earthly Deities and their officers, and the one hundred twenty attendants to investigate this petition and submit it on our behalf. May they capture and restore the five-depletion and six-depletion ghosts within this dwelling, returning each to their proper direction.\n\nThe green-depletion and green-depletion ghosts are to be sent to the Eastern Green Emperor for confinement, forbidden to wander. The red-depletion and red-depletion ghosts are to be sent to the Southern Red Emperor for confinement, forbidden to wander. The white-depletion and white-depletion ghosts are to be sent to the Western White Emperor for confinement, forbidden to wander. The black-depletion and black-depletion ghosts are to be sent to the Northern Black Emperor for confinement, forbidden to wander. The yellow-depletion and yellow-depletion ghosts are to be sent to the Central Yellow Emperor for confinement, forbidden to wander, that they may no longer disturb this household.\n\nMay the invoked celestial officials and soldiers, along with the Three Generals guarding this dwelling and their three hundred thousand troops, unite in purpose and strength to expel the depleting ghosts from this dwelling. May this household’s wealth and property gather and flourish, misfortune be transformed into fortune, silkworms and fields yield a hundredfold, cattle and calves fill the pens, gold and silver accumulate, quarrels cease, disasters vanish, all wishes be fulfilled, the household thrive in peace, and wealth and sustenance increase.\n\n**Petition for Dwelling Pacification**\nDuly recording the ritual rank,\n\n**Petition to the Celestial Court:**\n\nWe, the undersigned [number] persons, humbly submit: our dwelling has been unsettled, and we fear we have unwittingly offended the netherworld authorities, thereby inviting the influx of baleful *qi*. In this year’s celestial cycle, the Five Poisons spread unchecked, afflicting the people of heaven without regard for the virtuous or the base.\n\nWe, born of the womb in ignorance, descendants of the lower officials, have by a thousand generations’ fortune been granted the grace to serve the Great Dao. Yet we remain ever fearful, finding no ground upon which to rest secure. Recently, our household—elders and children alike—has dwelt within this troubled abode, unable to safeguard ourselves, our anxieties deepening.\n\nIn recent years, we may have undertaken repairs, excavations, or renovations—moving fences, replacing pillars—matters of no single kind, yet all risking transgression against the celestial prohibitions and earthly taboos: the Generals of the Great Sun and the Grand Year-Star, the spirits of heads and feet, the *qi* of one’s ruling year and life destiny, the Great and Lesser Depletions, the baleful stars of calamity and misfortune, the Hooking Chen and White Tiger, the spirits of the twelve hours, the earthly numina and earthly slayers, all manner of depletions, and the officials of the upper and lower earth. We fear such offenses have caused the spirits of our dwelling to grow restless, and the dragon deities presiding over our well and hearth to withhold their favor. We pray that our household may be granted stability, our dwelling prosper, and all within find peace.\n\nInvoking the *Petition of the Twelve Hundred Officials of the Celestial Master*, we reverently beseech the descent of one hundred twenty divine lords, generals, and officials, led by the *Qingyi* Great Masters, to absolve our household of all past and present transgressions and to dissolve them entirely. We humbly entreat the Five Lords of the Earth and their one hundred twenty officials to dispel the Generals of the Grand Year-Star, Great Yin, and Great Sun; the Great and Lesser Depletions; the spirits of silkworm chambers and livestock; and all ghosts bound by upper and lower prohibitions—may they be utterly eradicated.\n\nWe reverently summon:\n- The Nine Lords of the Eastern Yi, under the Azure Emperor,\n- The Eight Lords of the Southern Man, under the Vermilion Emperor,\n- The Six Lords of the Western Rong, under the White Emperor,\n- The Five Lords of the Northern Di, under the Black Emperor,\n- The Three Lords of the Central Qin, under the Yellow Emperor,\n\nalong with the *qi* of the four seasons and the five earths, mutually dividing their influences, and the officials and generals of the four directions. May they descend to our dwelling to purge all prohibitions, the thousand spirits and ten thousand demons, the lingering *qi* of the lower officials, and the baleful ghosts of years, months, days, and hours—all calamities, ruptures, and harms—may they be utterly dissolved.\n\nMay the Five Emperors pacify this dwelling, and may no misfortunes arise. May blessings and protection abide through the year, the four seasons pass in tranquility, the eight solar terms remain free of disaster, and the twenty-four *qi* nodes align in harmony. May Heaven above broadly cover, and Earth below universally bear, that we may forever enjoy steadfast fortune.\n\n- The Azure Dragon of *Zhen* governs the left of the dwelling,\n- The Vermilion Dragon of *Li* governs the front,\n- The White Dragon of *Dui* governs the right,\n- The Black Dragon of *Kan* governs the rear,\n- The Yellow Dragon of *Kun* guards the center.\n\nMay the Five Dragons govern this dwelling, repelling all inauspiciousness, dissolving all malevolence, and sweeping away a thousand woes. May the divine dragons bring peace and stability, fostering harmony among the four neighbors. May rebellion be transformed into obedience, past transgressions erased, and future goodness accomplished. May the *qi* of the Dao flow freely, rendering the dwelling pure and auspicious. May officials ascend in rank, all desires be fulfilled, and the day of heart’s contentment arrive—without fail or betrayal of trust.\n\nWe implore the Most High to discern and grant our plea. We beseech with lamentation. Thus concludes this petition.\n\nFor the household of [Certain Family], fearing that their dwelling may be unsettled, the Dragon spirits unfavorable, and taboos obstructed, I humbly present this petition. I earnestly appeal to the **Celestial Officials** and their subordinates, beseeching them to:\n\n- Remove the malevolent *qi* of ghosts,\n- Soothe the **Netherworld Officials** (*Míngsī*),\n- Invite the Five Dragons to dwell and protect the premises and its occupants.\n\nI pray for a **Precious Charter of Grace** (*Enbǎo zhāng*) to be granted and delivered to the [Certain] Bureau, thus:\n\n---\n**Charter of Plague Eradication** (*Duànwēn dúyì zhāng*)\nWith due respect to the **Celestial Hierarchy** (*Dàodào*), I submit:\n\n- May the **Celestial Officials** (*Shàngguān*) command the cessation of the plague.\n- Though I am dim-witted and ignorant of the malevolent *qi* of ghosts, according to the **Thousand and Two Hundred Officials’ Charter** (*Tiānshī qiān èr bǎi guān zhāng*), there exist **Lowly Officials** (*Xiàguān*) of *qi*, along with **Licentious Ghosts** and **Bandit Spirits** (*Yéyín guǐ zéi*), encircling the **Heavenly Circuit** (*Zhōutiān*) and the Earth, recklessly generating calamities and afflicting virtuous folk.\n\n- I have heard that the **Most High** (*Tàishàng*), in His lofty exaltation, rules the **Three Heavens** (*Sāntiān*) with purity and distance, His universe vast, His **Sun and Moon** radiant, illuminating all things without exception. All malevolent ghosts are thus slain and annihilated.\n\nIf so, then:\n- In the **East**, the **Green Plague** (*Qīngwēn*), **Green Toxin** (*Qīngdú*), and **Green Spasm** (*Qīngjìng*) arise, with the ghost named **High Reach** (*Gāoyuǎn*).\n- In the **South**, the **Red Plague** (*Chìwēn*), **Red Toxin** (*Chìdú*), and **Red Sickness** (*Chìzhèng*) arise, with the ghost named **Scholar’s Speech** (*Shìyán*).\n- In the **West**, the **White Plague** (*Báiwēn*), **White Toxin** (*Báidú*), and **White Sickness** (*Báizhèng*) arise, with the ghost named **White Fortune** (*Báixìng*).\n- In the **North**, the **Black Plague** (*Hēiwēn*), **Black Toxin** (*Hēidú*), and **Black Epidemic** (*Hēizhòu*) arise, with the ghost named **Great Yellow Slave** (*Dàyuán núláo*), along with his seven sons, and male and female siblings, each propagating their own malevolent plague *qi*.\n\nFrom the **First Month** to the **Twelfth Month**, each has its own plague ghosts, spreading freely and causing suffering throughout the land.\n\nMoreover, in the **years of Jiazi, Yichou, Rényǐn, Mǎodǐng, Chénwèi, Sìwǔ, Wèiwǔ, Shēnshēn, Yǒuyǒu, Xǔyǒu, Hàiyǒu**, and the **Twelfth Month of Chén**, each plague ghost bears a name and rank.\n\nFrom the **Twelve Earthly Branches** (*Shíèr shí*) of the day, the Five Directions, Five Colors, and the **Yellow Slave** (*Huángnúláo*)—the **Old Vermin** (*Lǎochóng*)—all descend upon us.\n\nIn this degenerate age, the foolish populace face calamities without end, dying in numbers beyond count.\n\nSince the day I received the **Dao**, I have sworn to aid the nation and sustain life, to heal the people, and according to the **Scriptures of the Celestial Hierarchy** (*Kēwén*), to exterminate falsehoods and sweep away rebellious ghosts, all of which I have done.\n\nHaving been entrusted with this sacred office, I now humbly prostrate myself in petition, praying that the **Most High** (*Tàishàng*), the **Supreme Dao of the Limitless** (*Wújí Dàodào*), and all the **Honorable Lords** (*Zhūjūn zhàngrén*), may cover my household with Your boundless grace, utterly rooting out all malevolent spirits and eradicating their essence.\n\nThe **Celestial Officials** (*Shàngguān*)’s envoys shall, in due time, grant this decree.\n\nI pray that:\n- The **East**’s **Celestial Official** (*Qīngdì*) command **Victory** (*Chéng*) and **Absolute Cessation** (*Jué*) of the **Green Plague**,\n- The **South**’s **Celestial Official** (*Chìdì*) command **Peace** (*Píng*) and **Absolute Cessation** (*Jué*) of the **Red Plague**,\n- The **West**’s **Celestial Official** (*Báidì*) command **Exile** (*Qiān*) and **Absolute Cessation** (*Jué*) of the **White Plague**,\n- The **North**’s **Celestial Official** (*Hēidì*) command **Lengthening** (*Cháng*) and **Absolute Cessation** (*Jué*) of the **Black Plague**,\n- The **Central**’s **Five Father Lords** (*Wǔfùjūn*) command **Absolute Cessation** (*Jué*) of the **Yellow Plague** (*Huángwēn*).\n\nFor the **Four Cardinal Directions** (*Dōngxī nánběi*), the **Four Intermediate Directions** (*Sìwéi*), the **Twelve Branches of Time** (*Shíèr shí*), and all spirits within, may they all be commanded to guard against malevolence, preventing it from entering.\n\nFurthermore, the **Celestial Sovereigns** (*Dì*) of the **East** (*Qīngdì*), **South** (*Chìdì*), **West** (*Báidì*), and **North** (*Hēidì*), in their singular power, shall simultaneously descend and bestow aid.\n\nI earnestly appeal to the **King of Ten Thousand Ghosts** (*Bāi guǐ zhōngwáng*) of the **High Heavens** (*Gāotiān*), with **Twelve Thousand** (*Wàn èr qiān*) soldiers, each commanding **Eight Hundred Thousand** (*Bāi shíwàn*) troops, to join with the **subordinate officers** (*Shēnzhōng yìbīng*) within my person, as well as the **Three Generals** (*Sān jiāngjūn*) who guard this dwelling, the **Twenty-Four Officials** (*Èrshísì lì*), and the **Three Hundred Thousand** (*Sān bǎi shíwàn*) soldiers, all with blades in unison, encircling the dwelling in **three layers** (*Sāncéng*), and **two markets** (*Èr shì*) around the perimeter, their weapons pointing outward, to sweep away in one moment all malevolent, rebellious, and licentious spirits, utterly annihilating them.\n\nThe **Celestial Officials** (*Shàngguān*) shall, upon hearing my plea, reward my labor faithfully, without failing to fulfill my earnest trust.\n\nI pray with deepest reverence.\n\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (*Tàishàng*) decrees as follows:\n\nFor the sake of the **House of [Name]**, I humbly beseech the **Celestial Officials** (*Tiānguān*) for their grace, to **sever and terminate** (*fángduàn*) all diseases, and likewise those of neighboring households.\n\nI submit a **petition** (*zhāng*) to the **Five-Direction Celestial Officials** (*Wǔfāng Tiānguān*) to **apprehend and capture** (*shōuchǔ*) the **Five Plagues** (*Wǔwēn yì*) and all **malignant pestilential spirits** (*lìguǐ zéizéi*), the **bandit ghosts** (*biéguǐ*), and the **demonic chapters** (*zhāng*), in one unified document, and present it to the **Three Celestial Tribunals** (*Sān Tiān Cáo*).\n\n**The Chapter of the Red Pine Child** (*Chìsōngzǐ zhāng* – *Volume III completed*), **The Chapter of the Red Pine Child** (*Volume IV completed*), **The Chapter of the Severed Ghostly Leader** (*Duàn Kuíquán zhāng*), and **The Chapter of the Proper Ritual Rank** (*Jùfǎ wèi zhāng*)—\n\nI now **solemnly vow** (*[Name] jí rì kuāitóu zìliè*) with bowed head, **pleading in words** (*kǒu qǐ ēncí*), born of **the Pure Dao** (*sù yǐ tāishēng*), a thousand generations of joyous fortune, to have **received and honored the Great Way** (*dé fèng Dàdào*), though unworthy, and **gratefully accepted their grace**.\n\nRecently, these spirits have **descended and encroached** (*qǐngzhě yǐ lái jūchù niǎnqì*), with diseases **interconnectedly afflicting** (*jíbìng xiānglián*) me. The **divination** (*bǔshù*) reveals that **mountain springs and three rivers** (*shānguān sān hé*) are the **cursed sources** (*wéihuò*), and that **ghosts dwelling in the nearby lands, mountains, and forests** (*jīncì jiān tǔdì shānlín mìshí zhī guǐ*), seeking sustenance, are **harassing my person** (*qīnhài [Name] shēn*). In **fear and dread**, I have **warded off and fortified my dwelling** (*yōubù píngyíng*), yet I **know not what virtue/power** (*gōngdé*) to cultivate. With **one heart**, I **entrust myself to the Great Way** (*shàngpíng Dàdào*) to **save my life and command**.\n\nI **instruct the subordinate officers** (*gàosù xiàng chén*) to submit a **petition for mercy** (*qiǔqǐ zhāngzòu*), **apprehending and expelling** (*shōuchú*) all **ghostly deities and spirits** (*zázhǒng guǐshén*) from the **four directions** (*lǐyù dōngxī nánběi*)—**mountain springs, four ridges, and rivers** (*shānguān sì lǒng hézhōng*)—that **ravage and oppress** (*héngxíng huòsuì*).

I have petitioned the officials, seeking this scroll for deliverance. Due to my limited learning, I do not grasp the **qi** and seasons, nor possess refined numerology. I rely solely on the **Six Jia** and **Five Phases** to determine cycles and fate.*\n\n*By tradition, the **Steel-Hai** direction (absolute **yang**) is the **Heavenly Net**, while the **Chen-Si** direction (absolute **yin**) is the **Earthly Snare**. When one’s fate aligns with these, disaster follows. For men, if their **birth year** clashes with the **Tàisuì** (Yearly Official), their **birth month** becomes the **Heavenly Net’s transmission**, and their **conception month** the **Earthly Snare**. For women, if their **birth year** clashes with the **current year**, their **conception month** becomes the **Heavenly Net’s River Chief**, and their **birth month** the **Earthly Snare**. Additionally, if the **current year** clashes with their **birth year’s Tàisuì**, their **conception month** becomes the **Heavenly Net’s transmission**, and their **birth month** the **Earthly Snare**. Further, when the **Heavenly Halter** aligns with **Tàiyī**, it becomes the **Heavenly Net**. If the fetus resides in **Dēngmíng**, it becomes the **Earthly Halter**. Months of **Five Punishments, Six Calamities, Seven Injuries, and Nine Afflictions**, as well as years and months of decline, or when **Halter and Chief** clash in lethal combinations—these bring myriad disasters and misfortunes, causing untold harm.*\n\n*I fear my household’s fate may collide with the **Five Directions’ Nets**, the **Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams**, their mutual assaults, or the **Nine Heavens’ Primordial Qi** descending into the mortal realm, spanning **Nine Hundred and Ninety Li** in all directions. The **Net** burns like flames, the **Snare** looms like black clouds, both infused with the **Nine Stars’ essence**, their **Red Precision** blazing. If my fate aligns with these, ruin is immediate.*\n\n*Now, I offer **ritual efficacy**—one bolt of undyed silk, **1,200 coins**, **12 dou of white rice**, **1.2 sheng of oil**, **120 sheets of paper**, **120 feet of red cord**, a pair of **handcuffs**, **1 liang of raw silk**, ink, brushes, incense, and lamps—humbly praying that the **Celestial Officials**, the **Most High’s Boundless Dao**, the **Heavenly Master’s Gate**, the **Five Qi Lords**, and the **Typists of Records** may deign to intervene:\n\n- **East: Yín-Mǎo-Chén (Wood Qi Lords)**—dissolve the **East’s Green Affliction and Green Poison**.\n- **South: Wù-Wǔ-Yǒu (Fire Qi Lords)**—dissolve the **South’s Red Affliction and Red Poison**.\n- **West: Shēn-Yǒu-Xū (Metal Qi Lords)**—dissolve the **West’s White Affliction and White Poison**.\n- **North: Hài-Zǐ-Chǒu (Water Qi Lords)**—dissolve the **North’s Black Affliction and Black Poison**.\n- **Center: Wù-Jǐ (Earth Qi Lords)**—dissolve the **Center’s Yellow Affliction and Yellow Poison**.\n\n*May the **Five Directions’ Qi** and the **Twelve Hours** pose no harm.*\n\n*I have heard: the **upper three fives** belong to Heaven, the **middle three fives** to Man, the **lower three fives** to Earth. Heaven’s **Five Phases** govern clarity of sun and moon; Earth’s **Five Qi** nurture all things; Man’s **Five Constants** ensure vitality. When **ritual and music** are preserved, harmony is complete. I fear my household’s **Five Qi** are misaligned, my **zàng-fǔ** (viscera) disordered, the **Five Phases** clashing in destructive cycles. I humbly pray that the **Superior Officials** may:\n\n- **Above**, dissolve the **Five Stars’ Auspicious Qi**,\n- **Below**, lift the **Thirty-Six Earthly Taboos**,\n- **Within**, absolve my **ten thousand sins and myriad offenses**.\n\n*I further petition the **Seven Stars of the Big Dipper**:\n- **Tānláng (Acquisition Wolf)** and **Jùmén (Supreme Gate)** to **sever the source of death**,\n- **Lùcún (Luck Star)** and **Liánzhēn (Generosity)** to **replace the fatal form**,\n- **Wénqū (Literary Curve)** and **Wǔqū (Martial Curve)** to **erase the death record**.\n\n*I also petition the **Lords of Severing Afflictions, the Supreme Ancestral Blessing, the Lords of Fate and Qi, and the Jade Calendar Lords**, each with **120 officers**, to **apprehend and disperse my myriad calamities**, dissolving all afflictions—from the **First to the Ninth**—across my residence. May the **True Officials** record their **Qi**, oversee, and summon my **ancestors, parents, relatives, and in-laws**, granting them entry into the **Central Palace** for **official rank and rewards**, assigning them to bureaus by merit, promoting them by rank, and ensuring that the **living and the dead** receive blessings, with **spirits and mortals** aiding one another, so that my **lifespan may extend**, my **afflictions be surpassed**, and this petition proven true.*\n\n*Humbly submitted to the **Most High’s Distinction*.*\n\n「The *Dai Ma* (Relay Horse) Chapter also states the *Kai Du* (Opening the Way) Chapter:\n\n*\"[The following] rites and ranks are established. [I] humbly declare: I, by virtue of being born from the womb, and my descendants, have for a thousand years been fortunate enough to receive the blessings of the **Great Dao/Way** and to have always been under its grace. Now, in the year of the **Relay Horse** (驿马), which is a year of seeking blessings, if I do not submit a petition to **exhort and welcome** the **Relay Horse**, I fear there may be obstruction, harm to my lifespan, and stagnation in my official rank and stipends.\n\nYet, with only anxiety and no merit to cultivate, I rely solely on sincerity of heart to submit this petition, **appeasing and averting** the calamities of the **Relay Horse** and inviting the blessings of rank and stipends, so that no harm may come. Now, I present the **ritual oath** (法信), with a golden figure of a man, five-colored ceremonial offerings, and the aforementioned items, to establish my **sincere vow** (立心信) and seek to **remove and dispel** the calamities of the **Relay Horse**, to **ascend and bestow** wealth and stipends, to **transcend and escape** temporal disasters, and to **permanently ensure** the **Original Auspiciousness** (元吉), so that I may enter the **Diagram of Life** (生图) and exhort the **Relay Horse**, thereby preserving my lifespan. I pray that my entire household, great and small, may be spared from all other misfortunes.\n\nI, as a humble subject, being ignorant and unversed in the **Dao/Way of Qi** (气候), have heard that the **Great Ease** (太易) has the **virtue/power** (功) of **rectifying faults and atoning for sins**, and that the **Retreating Armor** (遁甲) holds the **Dao/Way** of **seeking to establish and avoid calamities**.*\n\nThe **Original One** with a single heart, humbly appeals to the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Highest Sage**, the **Honorable Lords and Masters**, the **Heavenly Master**, and the **Three Noble Ladies**, whether one’s fate is already exhausted or yet to be extended.\n\nWith utmost reverence, I petition the **August Heavenly Sovereign**, the **Royal and Ministerial Canopy**, the **North Pole Star Lord**, the **Three Celestial Lords of Fate and Fortune**, and the **Lord Who Supports Fate**, to uphold and exalt the **Relay Horse**, so that official rank and stipends may be fulfilled.\n\nWith the **golden figure** (金人), I present it to the **North Pole Star**, to **extract fate and remove the deathly calamity**. With **five colored silks**, each one piece, I present them to the **Five Directions’ Five Emperors**, to **invite and augment official rank and stipends**.\n\nThe **purple case cloth**, **ivory talisman**, **stitched garments**, and **wooden sandals** are offered to **attest to one’s official station**. The **purple parasol**, one piece, is used to **shelter one’s natal destiny**. The **mat**, one length, is spread beneath the **proper seat**. The **oil**, one *dou* and two *sheng*, is used to **illuminate the Void and Mysterious**.\n\nThe **black silk thread** and **divination tally**, to **prolong stipends and lifespan**. The **rice**, one *dan* and two *dou*, to **benefit the granaries**. The **paper, ink, and brush**, to **record and establish the Register of Life**. The **money**, one thousand two hundred *wen*, to **pledge the sincerity of the red heart**.\n\nThe **incense**, one *jin*, to pray that the **North Pole Star** removes one’s name from the **Register of Death** and the **South Pole Star** inscribes it in the **Register of Life**, thus extending lifespan endlessly.\n\nI further petition the **Functionary Lords of Vital Qi**, to ascend to the **Supreme Mysterious Palace of Life**, requesting the **adjustment of stellar degrees and calculations**, to **replace and transform one’s name and form**.\n\nI also petition the **Lord of Fate** and the **Lord Who Summons the Soul**, to proceed north to the **Dark Yin Lady of the Netherworld** and the **Lord Who Extends One’s Name**, each five in number, with **official attendants** numbering one hundred twenty, to **assist me in upholding and inviting the Relay Horse**, so that official rank and stipends may ascend in glory, while calamities and disasters are exterminated, and the **heart and viscera** shine with clarity. The **Eight Trigrams of Heaven and Earth—Kàn, Zhèn, Xùn, Lǐ, Kūn, and Duì—**, the **Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions**, and the **Three Hills and Five Graves**, overseeing the **seasons and their nodes**, shall witness these meritorious deeds, cycling endlessly in their course.\n\nI further petition the **General Who Protects Fate**, the **Lord of Ten Thousand Blessings**, the **Lord Who Relieves Affliction**, the **Lord of Qi Circulation**, and the **Lord Who Dissolves Calamities and Supports the Declining**, each fifteen in number, with **official attendants** numbering one hundred twenty, to **work in concert with me**, safeguarding my person and fate, elevating my official station, extending my years and augmenting my calculations, filling my granaries with grain and silk, and amassing wealth, thus **permanently preserving the Original Auspiciousness**.\n\nThe petitioned celestial officials, having accepted their roles, shall, according to the **Three Auspicious Days** of my petition, fulfill their functions without failing in their efficacy.\n\nBy the **Supreme Sage’s discernment**, pity my humble inadequacy.\n\nThus, through the **Two Official Direct Envoys**, the **Functionary of the Orthodox Unity**, the **Left and Right Official Envoys**, the **Divine Clerks of Yin-Yang**, the **Clerks of the Scarlet Talisman Carriage**, and the **Just Wind Cavalry Stationed at the Relay Horse**, each with two officials, I, **[Subject’s Name]**, humbly submit this **Petition for Harmonizing the Relay Horse, Removing Calamities, and Inviting Wealth and Stipends**, to be presented to the **[Relevant Bureau]**.\n\nI await your gracious notification.\n\nYour humble servant, **[Subject’s Name]**, in deepest awe and trepidation, kowtows and presents this petition for Your Celestial Excellency’s consideration.\n\n**Acknowledgment of the Five Tombs Petition**\nWith due observance of ritual rank, I humbly state:\n\nAccording to the written records, **[Subject’s Name]**, of **[County]**, reports that in this **[month/day]**, **[his/her] illness** has worsened, with no improvement in recovery—fearing for **[his/her] life**. Since **[Subject’s Name’s]** three generations of ancestors and seven generations of forebears, their accumulated sins have invited calamities and retributions. Whether within the tombs, there are grievances and disputes, or the wrath of Heaven and Earth has caused the departed to rest uneasily, disturbing the living. Or perhaps the ancestral mounds have been severed, the cypress and pine felled by others, bricks dug from the tomb edges, or roads encroaching upon the burial grounds—deeply fearing that one day the spirits may sink into the depths of the underworld.\n\nHaving already petitioned the **Celestial Officials**, **Three Realms’ True Sovereigns**, and submitted the relevant documents, I now present this **Sacred Oath of the Dao** with offerings: one bolt of yellow silk, twelve *dou* of white rice, twelve *sheng* of oil, one thousand two hundred coins, paper, ink, incense, and fruit. I humbly pray to the **Supreme Dao** to accept this petition, absolve the departed, stabilize the tombs, and for both the living and the dead—through countless sins and transgressions—all may be cleansed.\n\nI have also received oral instructions to present this petition to the **Celestial Bureau**, praying for Your **Merciful Inspection** and **Pardon** for all ancestors, both recently and long deceased, as well as for all past and present offenses, curses, grievances, and vengeful *qi* associated with the tombs. May all be severed, and may **[Subject’s Name]** recover swiftly, the departed rest in peace, and the tombs remain serene.\n\nI further petition to **Acknowledge the Five Tomb Lords**, and also invoke the **Grand Star Marshal**, **Green Canopy Official Marshal**, **Supreme Clarity Palace Sovereign**, and the **Earthly Marshal**, each with one hundred twenty attendants, to descend and **Remove**[**Subject’s Name’s**] Illness and **Absolve the Departed**.\n\nWhether the tomb lies at the **Dragon’s Head**, **Tail**, **Left**, **Right**, or **Foot**, or within the **Forbidden Zones of Movement and Coiling**, causing the spirits to tremble in terror and unrest, returning harm to the living—leading to **[Subject’s Name’s]** current **illness and afflictions**. I pray for the **Extinction of the Five-Tone Mound Officials**, the **Two-Thousand-Stone Tomb Guardians**, and all **Tomb *Qi* Officials**, so that the departed may rest undisturbed, free from calamities, and all offenses be pardoned.\n\nMay the living and the dead live without blame or punishment, all grievances resolved. May **[Subject’s Name’s]** household flourish, with unbroken lineage.\n\nThis shall not fail in its efficacy.\n\nYour **Grace is Supreme**.\n\nThe Most High distinguishes and grants mercy to this humble servant.\n\nIn solemn reverence, I hereby dispatch through the **Two Officials of Direct Command**, the **Functionary of Rectification and Unity**, the **Left and Right Official Messengers**, the **Divinatory Officials of Yin-Yang**, the **Red-Symbol Officials of the Science Bureau**, the **Officials of the Just Wind Cavalry**, the **Express-Horse Chapter Officials**, and the **Flying Dragon Cavalry Officials**, with two officials from each office.\n\nAdditionally, I dispatch the **Direct Divine Attendants** and **Symbol Officials** of the **Cloud Officials** on the **Stellium Hour** of the **certain day**, with the **Divine Attendants and Symbol Officials** changing according to the hour, setting this as precedent.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I act as the **Ritual Master** for the household of **[Subject’s Name]**, great and small, in their **illnesses**, and humbly present a **Jewel Chapter of Petition** to the **Celestial Official of the Six Dragons**, seeking **forgiveness for tomb transgressions**, **reconciliation of the departed**, and **pardon of the Tomb *Qi* Officials**, to be delivered to the **Most High** in the **Certain Bureau** of the **Certain Palace**.\n\nThe **Bureau and Palace** shall follow the changes of the **month and day**, setting this as precedent.\n\nI humbly await **notification**.\n\nYour servant, **[Subject’s Name]**, trembling with awe, prostrates himself with head bowed and hands clasped, submitting this with utmost reverence.\n\n*(Blank three lines)*\n\nYour servant, **[Subject’s Name]**, of **[Affiliation]**, presents this for incense and revision.\n\n*(Blank three lines)*\n\nTo the **Supreme Dao of the Three Heavens, the Most High, the Peerless Primordial Dao, the Supreme Golden Threshold of the Seven Treasures and Jade, the Most High Lord of the Great Void, the Most High Venerable Elder, the Heavenly Emperor, the Heavenly Elder, the Nine Old Immortals of the Nine Black Elders, the Hundred Thousand Ten Thousandfold Dao and *Qi*, the Twelve Hundred Official Lords**—**\n\n*(Blank three lines)*\n\nIn the **Year of [Animal]**, the **Yearly Cycle of [Stem-Branch]**, the **Month of [Month]**, the **Day of [Day]**, the **Hour of [Hour]**, this **Chapter** is presented at the **Ritual Altar** of **[Location]**.\n\n*(Blank three lines)*\n\n**Permit the use of a full sheet of paper for this document.**\n\nTo the **Supreme Dao of the Three Heavens, the Most High, the Peerless Primordial Dao, the Supreme Golden Threshold of the Seven Treasures and Jade**—\n\nYour servant, **[Subject’s Name]**, of the **ranked position for petitioning laws**, humbly submits this **sealed petition**.\n\n**Sealed within the Inner Envelope.**\n\nWith utmost reverence, **[Subject’s Name]**, of the **ranked position for petitioning laws**, **re-seals** this.\n\n**To the Most High Venerable Elder of the Void:**\n\n**Spoken to the Certain Bureau of the Certain Official.**\n\n**Sealed within the Outer Envelope.**\n\nWith utmost reverence, **[Subject’s Name]**, of the **ranked position for petitioning laws**, **re-seals** this and presents it.\n\n**Permit the use of a full sheet of paper for this document.**\n\nTo the **Supreme Dao of the Three Heavens, the Most High, the Peerless Primordial Dao, the Supreme Golden Threshold of the Seven Treasures and Jade**—\n\nYour servant, **[Subject’s Name]**, of the **ranked position for petitioning laws**, **re-seals** this and presents it.\n\n**To the Three Heavens’ Gate: Petition for Admission**\n\n**Dissolving the Five Tombs’ Seal**\n\nYour servant, **[Subject’s Name]**, of the **ranked position for petitioning laws**, humbly states:\n\nIn accordance with the **Mysterious Doctrine**, I now, by virtue of my native place **[Subject’s Native Region]**, kneel and submit myself. By nature, I was born of the womb, and my descendants are likewise born of the womb. Yet within my own person, this year marks the **Tomb Year**—the **Year of the Dog**—when I risk being ensnared by the **Five Tombs’ calamities** and the **Three Killings’ malevolence**.\n\nShould a person enter the Tomb Year, they may be bound by the **Tomb God’s retribution**, ensnared by **ghostly qi**. Recently, my limbs have grown heavy, my appetite has waned, and I know not how to **redeem the Five Tombs’ disasters** or **sustain my life**. With sincere devotion, I appeal to the **Great Dao**, humbly beseeching Your discerning gaze, and earnestly pray for deliverance.\n\nNow, I offer **faithful tokens**: five **substitute figures (锡人)**, one **stone and two dou of rice**, one thousand two hundred **copper coins**, one **bolt of plain cloth**, one **dou and two sheng of oil**, one hundred twenty **sheets of paper, writing brushes, and counting rods**, to petition for a **sealed decree** that severs the **deceased’s misfortunes**. May these **substitute figures** bear my form, **divert my calamities**, and **prolong my life**.\n\nWith reverence, I submit this **sealed petition** for Your celestial scrutiny.\n\nI pray that the **Heavenly Tribunals’ officials** may extend mercy, inspect my case, and **grant absolution** for the **ten thousand sins and offenses** I have committed across seven lifetimes. May You further **cleanse and dispel** the **Five Tombs’ and Five Directions’ calamities**, substituting the **five figures** in my stead, so that my descendants may be spared from **erroneous suffering**.\n\nI further petition for the **Returning-Life Lord, Longevity Lord, Prolonging-Life Lord, Extracting-Life Lord, Continuing-Life Lord, Supporting-Life Lord, and Augmenting-Life Lords**—five each—to be dispatched, along with one hundred twenty **official attendants**, to the **Southern Palace’s Bureau of Fate and Records**, to **redeem my life** for the **three cycles of the Three Treasures**, the **three hundred and one periods**, and to **dissolve the calamities** within my person.\n\nMay they **open the Celestial Gate**, **reverse my death registry**, and **transfer my name** to the **Green Ledger of Immortality**, securing my lineage for eternity.\n\nAfter this petition, my lifespan shall be extended, the **Five Tombs’ retributions** severed, and their **disastrous punishments** transformed into **blessings**—thus proving the efficacy of this plea.\n\nWith gratitude to the **Supreme Primordial Worthies**, who distinguish truth from falsehood, I humbly seek but one moment of Your favor.\n\nThus, I append this petition in the same manner as before, only altering the **Direct Deity’s name**.\n\n**A Sealed Petition for the Heavenly Bureau to Dissolve the Five Tombs’ Retributions and Calamities, Substituting Figures for My Form, Seeking Mercy**\n\nPresented to the **Supreme Bureau of [Subject’s Deity’s] Palace**.\n\nIn the same format as before.\n\n**A Petition for the Deceased**\n\nYour servant, **[Subject’s Name]**, of the **ranked position for petitioning laws**, humbly states:\n\n**A Petition for the Heavenly Bureau to Dissolve Retributions and Calamities, Seeking Mercy for the Deceased and Protection for the Living**\n\nYour servant, **[Subject’s Name]**, of the **ranked position for petitioning laws**, humbly states:\n\nThe **Mysterious Ritual**—now, according to my native district **[Subject’s Place]**, in recent times, dreams and visions have proliferated within and without, my spirit wandering in confusion. Sometimes, malevolent spirits and ghosts gather in force, slanderous tongues arise, wealth is dissipated, and spectral apparitions appear frequently. The harvests fail—all due to offenses against my deceased parents and ancestors, the **Left Soil and Right Grain Deities** (*zuǒ shè yòu jì*), the **Well Turtle and Earth Spirits** (*jǐng’áo tǔ gōng*), and malevolent deities and ghosts. My entire household trembles in fear, relying on the **Dao/Way** and petitioning this servant to draft a memorial, seeking mercy from the **City Deities and Temple Spirits**, the **Generals of All Departments**, great and small **spiritually depleted entities**, the **Twelve Taboos**, and all deceased ancestors, all of which I humbly beseech to be absolved, as listed.\n\nDue to my ignorance and failure to grasp the **qi** and seasons, I kneel in submission, presenting this memorial to the **Heavenly Bureau**, praying that the **Supervising Officials** may, in due time, inspect and grant their benevolent judgment.\n\nI humbly request the summoning of **five Solving Retribution Lords**, **five Solving Punishment Lords**, and **five Solving Calamity Lords**, along with **one hundred twenty officer-spirits**, to represent me in petitioning the deceased, removing calamities, and safeguarding my household in peace. From this year onward, after the memorial is presented, all ten thousand offenses and sins shall be pardoned.\n\nMay my household, great and small, escape peril in safety, turn ruin into prosperity, avert disaster through fortune, and rise from death to life. For the **Heavenly Officials, soldiers, and spirits** who fulfill this request, I pray they may be rewarded according to their merits, advancing in rank as spoken—thus proving this plea’s efficacy.\n\nWith gratitude to the **Supreme Primordial Worthies**, who distinguish truth from falsehood, I humbly seek mercy for my unworthy self.\n\nFollowing the same format as before, only altering the **Direct Deity’s name**.\n\n**A Sealed Petition for the Heavenly Bureau to Dissolve Retributions and Calamities, Seeking Mercy for the Deceased and Protection for the Living**\n\nPresented to the **Supreme Bureau of [Subject’s Deity’s] Palace**.\n\nIn the same format as before.\n\n**A Petition for the Deceased and a Protective Fetal Memorial**\n\nYour servant, **[Subject’s Name]**, of the **ranked position for petitioning laws**, humbly states:\n*\"Your servant obeys.\"*\n\n**A Petition for Fetal Protection (保胎章)**\n\nYour servant, of the **playing rank (玄科)**, now according to the native district of **[Subject’s Name]**, today humbly presents this petition in person. By the grace of **Dao**, your servant’s descendants have been blessed for a thousand generations, granted the favor of receiving the **Primordial Virtue**. Though **[Subject’s Name]** and his wife have no merits to record, their offenses are many, and they fear that should they suffer unjust suffering, they will have no recourse. Thus, they seek your mercy to **protect the fetus**, dispel the **River Demon (河邪)** and malevolent wet nurses, and prevent miscarriage or harm from dark spirits and bandits.\n\nHumbly submitting this petition to the **Heavenly Bureau**, your servant prays to the **Supreme Dao**, the **Supreme Primordial Dao Lord**, the **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao**, and the **High Officials of the Bureau**, that they may inspect in due time.\n\nHumbly requesting:\n- **Two Lords of Fetal Protection (安胎君)**, with **120 officers** to safeguard **[Subject’s Wife’s]** body and life, ensuring an easy birth.\n- **Two Lords of Fetal Guardianship (护胎君)**, with **120 officers**, to defend the **Three Primordial Fields (三元丹田)** within **[Subject’s Wife’s]** womb, warding off malevolent *qi*, *wǎngliàng* (魍魉), and demonic bandits, nurturing the child, so that **[Subject’s Wife]** may remain unharmed, free from obstacles, her pregnancy secure, completing the **Six Li (六甲)** without incident, and bearing a child at full term—mother and child meeting safely.\n\nMay the **Great Sage of the Celestial Gate (天门大圣)** shield **[Subject’s Wife’s]** body and spirit, freeing her from all suffering.\n\nYour servant will report the merits and labors of these Lords and Holy Mothers, proving this plea’s efficacy.\n\nWith gratitude to the **Supreme Primordial Worthies**, who distinguish truth from falsehood, your servant humbly seeks mercy for his unworthy self.\n\nFollowing the same format as before, only altering the **Direct Deity’s name**.\n\nHumbly submitting this **Fetal Protection Petition (保胎章)** to the **Supreme Bureau of [Subject’s Deity’s] Palace**.\n\n---\n**A Petition for Accelerated Birth (催生章)**\n\nYour servant, **[Subject’s Name]**, of the **ranked position for petitioning laws**, humbly states:\n*\"Your servant obeys.\"*\n\n**Petition for Accelerated Birth (催生章)**\n\nYour servant, **[Subject’s Name]**, of the **ranked position for petitioning laws**, humbly states:\n*\"Your servant obeys.\"*\n\nBy **Mysterious Technique (玄科)**, today Your servant has relied on **[Subject’s Name’s]** own spoken testimony to record this plea.

Now **[Subject’s Wife’s]** months of pregnancy have reached fulfillment, but fearing an **unsafe delivery (临生不安)**, Your servant’s dread has doubled. With a single heart, Your servant now invokes the **Great Dao/Way (大道)**, submitting a **petition for accelerated birth (求乞章奏)** to the **Celestial Bureau (天曹)**. Your servant is deeply grateful for this mercy.\n\nYour servant humbly presents this **prostrate petition (伏地拜章)** and prays that the **Supreme Officials (上官主者)** may, in due time, **grant relief (平省)**.\n\nYour servant respectfully requests the **Celestial Gate’s Childbirth Attendants (天门子户君)**—two in number—along with the **Accelerating Birth Lord (速生君)** and **Nurse Lady (乳母君)**, each two in number, the **Birth Guide Lord (导生君)**, the **Birth Mother Lady (生母君)**, the **Heavenly Physician of Birth (天医助生君)**, and the **Accelerating Birth Lord (催生君)**, totaling six, as well as **Accelerating Birth Yellow Emperor (催生黄帝)**, all humbly invoked to the **central courtyard (中庭)**. Your servant seeks to witness the **forms of mother and child (子母形体)**.\n\nYour servant further requests the **Six Hundred Birth Parents (监临坐草六百生父)** to oversee **[Subject’s Wife’s]** birth, shielding her body and ensuring a **smooth delivery (生产滑利)**. May they **turn away adversity and follow harmony (舍逆从顺)**, repel all **taboos and malevolent influences (辟斥众忌)**—the **Yearly Slayer (岁杀)**, the **Monthly Slayer (月杀)**, the **Hourly Slayer (时杀)**, the **White Tiger (白虎)**, the **Caustic Pool (咸池)**, and the **thousands of evils and myriad spirits (千邪万精)**—all be **utterly vanquished (一切消灭)**. May mother and child **meet safely (母子安全)**, fulfilling Your servant’s heart’s desire and **freeing them from all other suffering (解脱无他)**.\n\nYour servant will report the **merits and labors (功报劳)** of these **Holy Mothers (圣母)** and **auxiliary deities (佑助众神)**, proving this plea’s efficacy.\n\nWith gratitude to the **Supreme Primordial Worthies (太上众真)**, who distinguish truth from falsehood...\n\nThe **Supreme Primordial Worthies** distinguish truth from falsehood, and Your servant, humble and unworthy, seeks their mercy.\n\nWith due reverence, I follow the precedent of the previous chapter, substituting only the **Direct Deities** as stated.\n\nWith utmost respect, I submit this **petition to the Heavenly Official of Accelerated Birth** to be presented to the **Supreme Primordial [Name]’s Office of Administration**.\n\nFor the **Chapter of Illuminating and Transforming the Child**:\n\nIn accordance with the prescribed rites and ranks, I humbly declare:\n\nOn this day, I reside in **[Name] Village**, prostrating myself in self-identification. By fortune, I have been graced to serve the **Dao**, rejoicing beyond measure.\n\nYet, as a mere mortal of shallow faith, my devotion has often faltered, inviting the scrutiny of **qi**. Recently, my son **[Name]** has been plagued by chaotic dreams, fearing this omens ill fortune. His limbs are weak, and I dread he may fall into grave illness, knowing no merit to safeguard him.\n\nNow, I place my trust in the **Law**, surrendering sincerely. I beseech the **Dao** to instruct Your servant, praying for my son’s life to be prolonged, his **illumination and transformation** to flourish, his destiny to be enhanced, and his years to be extended, that he may be supported through decline and delivered from hardship.\n\nYour servant humbly submits this petition to the **Three Heavens’ Office of Administration**.\n\nWith deepest reverence, I await Your mercy.\n\n**Translation:**\n\nTo the Most High, Most Venerable, Supreme Primordial Lord,\nCompassionate Father, Holy Mother,\nSupreme Official of the Bureau of Records,\n\nI humbly beseech your blessings for **peace and safety**.\n\nI petition the **Five Celestial Lights of Heaven and Earth**—\nThe **Five Celestial Lights Lords of the Sun, Moon, and Stars**—\nTo the East, I summon the **Light of the Sun**,\nTo the West, I summon the **Light of the Moon**,\nTo the South, I summon the **Light of Fire**,\nTo the North, I summon the **Light of Water**,\nAt the Center, I summon the **Light of Earth**,\nAnd I pray for **longevity and eternal life** to be bestowed upon my mortal form.\n\nI summon the **Five Lords of Longevity**, the **Five Lords of the Flame Torch**, and the **Five Lords of the Three Souls and Seven Spirits**, along with their **One Hundred Twenty Officers**, to descend and disseminate **Divine Elixirs of the Celestial Immortals** and the **Harmonious Qi** into my body, restoring my complexion and vitality, making my essence radiant and joyous.\n\nI submit to the **Heavenly Bureau of Records**,\nTo remove my name from the **Registry of the Departed**,\nTo purge my former **impure qi**,\nTo register my new **name of rebirth**,\nTo harmonize the **Six Fu Organs** and stabilize the **Five Zang Organs**,\nTo augment my **longevity and vitality**,\nAnd to annihilate all **malevolent spirits and demons**.\n\nMay my dreams be **true and auspicious**,\nMay my food and drink be **delicious and nourishing**,\nMay I **long endure in safety**,\nAs proof of your **mercy and efficacy**.\n\nWith deepest gratitude, I await your blessings.\n\nThe **Most High Assembly of the True Ones** discerns my humble and unworthy pleas.\n\nWith utmost reverence, I submit through the **Two Official Envoys**, the **Director of Rectification**, the **Left and Right Official Messengers**, the **Divine Judges of Yin-Yang**, the **Officials of the Scarlet Talisman**, the **Officials of the Just Wind Cavalry stationed at the Relay Posts**, and the **Flying Dragon Cavalry Officials**, each with two representatives, bearing my petition:\n\n**A Petition to the Celestial Bureau of Illumination and Transformation**,\nSubmitted to the **Celestial Bureau of the Most High** for adjudication.\n\n**A Petition for the Protection of an Infant:**\n\nIn strict accordance with the prescribed rites, I humbly declare:\n\nFrom my earliest years, I have been blessed with fortune, granted the **Dao**, and have long received its boundless grace. Yet, my faith and devotion have often faltered. Now, my child—though still in infancy—has yet to recognize the world, and I am filled with dread. I fear that **impure qi and malevolent spirits**, **dark and defiled entities**, **nursemaids’ malevolent spirits**, **demons of Heaven and Earth, the River Spirit**, and **the blood-drenched ghosts of the Hooked Star** may conspire in darkness, assailing my child’s body. In desperation, I kneel and submit this petition, awaiting the **Heavenly Bureau’s** decree.\n\nI implore the **Most High** to grant special consideration.\n\n**For the Protection of an Infant and the Supplication of a Dying Person:**\n\nIn strict accordance with the prescribed rites, I humbly declare:\n\nTo the **Most High Laozi**, the **Lords of the Five Qi**, the **Celestial Master**, the **Gatekeepers**, and the **Lord of the Dao**, I beseech you to extend your grace and examine my case.\n\nI pray to the **Yang Immortal, Protector of the Soul** and the **Yin Immortal, Protector of the Spirit** (*Pò*), as well as the **Celestial Nurturer of Life**, to massage my body, expel the **impure qi** from my spleen, lungs, and kidneys, and from the upper and lower **large and small intestines** and **bile bladder**, and to disperse the **obscure qi** from the **Abyssal Sea** (*Yōudū Qìhǎi*). May the **Dao-qi** circulate freely, all **hundred channels** flow unimpeded, and my afflictions and calamities vanish, my complexion radiant and luminous, like the sun and moon in brilliance.\n\nI further pray to the **Supreme Sovereign of Ten Thousand Blessings**, the **Lord of Removing Afflictions**, **Father of the Eastern King**, and **Lady of the Western King**, each with five attendants, and to the **one hundred twenty officers** of the **Three Heavens and Nine Palaces**, including the **Officers of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches** (*Jiǎzǐ Jiǎwǔ Guānjūn*), that none of the **demonic poisons** may harm me.\n\nWith profound gratitude, I shall wholeheartedly fulfill this vow.\n\nThe grace is bestowed by the **Most High** as follows:\n\nFor my sake, I humbly petition the **Heavenly Bureau** to issue a decree for the **Protection of an Infant**.\n\n---\n\n**For the Supplication of a Dying Person:**\n\nIn strict accordance with the prescribed rites, I humbly declare:\n\nI have received the **Celestial Master’s** teachings, and now, according to my records, I kneel and submit this plea. Since birth, my descendants have been fortunate to receive the **Dao**, and I am truly delighted and at ease.\n\nYet, my faith has often strayed from the teachings, bringing misfortune and calamity upon me. Now, on the **certain day of the certain month**, I am gravely ill, my body burdened, and my dreams chaotic and unkind.\n\nI sought divination, and it revealed that the **deceased** (*wángrén*) is causing harm, with repeated entanglements, leading to this unending illness. I fear that death will not cease, and the affliction will never end, filling my household with dread. I fear my life may not be spared.\n\nToday, my heart is filled with earnest supplication, and I beg you for a cure. I have already composed this plea and submitted it to the **Heavenly Bureau**. I humbly await your decree.\n\nThe **Most High Venerable Lord Lao** (*Tàishàng Lǎojūn*), the **Most High Venerable Elder** (*Tàishàng Zhàngrén*), the **Heavenly Master Lord** (*Tiānshī Jūn*), and the **Master Beneath the Gate** (*Ménxià Zhǔ*)—may you grant me discernment.\n\nI earnestly petition the **Lord of My Native Star** (*Běnmìng Jūn*) among the **Ten Myriad** (*Shíwàn*), that you may for me dispel the **entangling *qi*** (*fùlián zhī qì*) of the deceased who repeatedly harms me, and may it be severed.\n\nThe souls and spirits of the living belong to their **origin** (*shēngshǐ*), each **beginning** (*yīyuán yīshǐ*) distinct—separated by **ten myriads and ninety thousand** (*wànwàn jiǔshí yú lǐ*). The living owe allegiance to **Imperial Heaven** (*Huángtiān*), while the dead submit to **Yellow Springs** (*Huángquán*). Their paths diverge—let them not disturb my body.\n\nAgain, I fear that the deceased may have committed the **most heinous offense** (*mòdà zhī zuì*), or that in death they bear **unpardonable transgressions** (*bùshè zhī qiān*), confined within the **various prisons** (*zhūyù*). Sometimes they are in **River Lord’s Prison** (*Hébó zhī yù*), sometimes in **Lady Qing’s Prison** (*Nǚqīng zhī yù*), sometimes in the **City God’s Temple** (*Chénghuáng shèmiào*). I know not where the soul and shade of the deceased may dwell—pray, guide them to **transmigration** (*qiāndá*), that they may find peace, ascend to **Heaven’s Hall** (*Tiāntáng*), and enjoy **natural sustenance** (*yīshí zìrán*), wandering freely without care. May their **tombs and graves** (*fénmù ānwěn*) be secure, their **petitions and grievances** (*zhùsòng xiāochén*) laid to rest, and my illness within my body **immediately removed** (*jīméng chúyù*). May the entanglements cease and my wishes be fulfilled—this shall be proof of your efficacy.\n\nWith deepest gratitude to the **Most High Assembly of Worthies** (*Tàishàng Zhòngzhēn*).\n\n**Translation:**\n\n*Pleading for mercy.* The undersigned, on behalf of [certain person], petitions the Celestial Officials to sever the lingering ties of the deceased and submit a memorial to the **Supreme Daoist Lord of [specific bureau]**. Regarding the memorial for the deceased’s lingering illness:\n\nIn strict accordance with the **Mysterious Ordinances**, it is now reported that [certain person] has long been unfaithful, inviting calamities and misfortunes. Recently, strange omens have multiplied, and illnesses have persisted, causing the entire household to live in dread. Through divination and calculations, it is revealed that the spirits of both ancestral and guest-deceased are resentful, tormenting the living. This is likely due to insufficient offerings during ancestral rites—insufficient food and drink at the seasonal sacrifices—inviting retribution from the vengeful dead.\n\nThus, we humbly beseech the **Supreme Daoist Lord of the Great Way** to guide and transmigrate these spirits, freeing them from suffering.\n\nIn addition, the undersigned petitions for the protection of **Five Guardian Lords** and **Five Protector Deities**, along with **one hundred twenty officials**, to oversee the exorcism of these malevolent spirits on behalf of [certain person]. May all illnesses and afflictions be pardoned and dispelled, confirming the efficacy of this plea.\n\nWith deepest gratitude to the **Most High Assembly of Worthies**.\n\n**Translation:**\n\n*Seeking mercy.* The undersigned, on behalf of [certain person], respectfully petitions the **Celestial Official of Illness** to submit a memorial for the expiation of the deceased. The document is to be presented to the **Supreme Daoist Lord of [specific Daoist Palace] for rectification**.\n\nA memorial for the elimination of fire calamities is submitted, with all proper ritual positions observed. The undersigned humbly states: In accordance with the **Mysterious Canon**, it is now reported that [name] of [state, county, and village lineage] has, on this day, personally declared his lineage’s fortune—descended through childbirth, his offspring and descendants have been blessed for a thousand generations to serve the **Great Dao**. From the outset, we have been graced with sincere benevolence and profound gratitude.\n\nYet, due to our own ignorance, we have failed to uphold the Daoist precepts, repeatedly inviting calamities. Recently, our senses have grown dim, and at [specific time], we witnessed a fire calamity descending upon [location], its radiance scorching the earth—likely a death omen. The fire has spread through villages and wards, harming the people, afflicting men and women beyond count. The distress and terror among both Daoists and laypersons are unbearable. How can this be averted?\n\nWe humbly rely on sincerity and appeal to the **Great Dao**. Following the master’s teachings, we kneel and submit this memorial to the **Three Celestial Bureaus**, praying that the fire calamity be instantly extinguished.\n\nWe petition the **Central Palace Officials**, along with the **Recorded Marshal General** and **Twenty-Four Officials**, with **three hundred thousand soldiers**, as well as the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**, the **Divinatory Officials and their Attendants**, the **Daoist Officials of the Two Mysterious, Three Primordial, and Four Beginnings**, the **Celestial Officials of the Eight Directions**, the **Community, Village, and Neighborhood Lords**, and the **Lords of the Four, Five, Seven, and Nine Wilds** to pacify the region. May the **True Officials residing in [specific village]** regulate the *qi*.\n\nWe further petition the **Lord of the Northern Darkness**, with **one hundred twenty officials**, to govern the **Northern Darkness Palace**. Additionally, we invoke the **Wind Lord and Rain Master** to extinguish the fire calamity at [location], banishing it a thousand *li* away.\n\nWe also summon the **Lord of Punishment**, with **one hundred twenty officials**, including **Song Wujie**, to subdue the fire calamity’s malevolent spirits, preventing them from burning the homes, dwellings, granaries, and storehouses of the virtuous.\n\nThe **Superior Officials** command the **two stars of the Eastern Heart and Tail**, to conceal the fire essence, and the **Perverse Spirit**, to suppress the wind. The **Wind Lord** is ordered to restrain the rebellious *qi*—let it not act outside its season.\n\nWe further petition the **Lord of the Northern Nine Seas**, with **one hundred twenty officials**, to activate the **Graduated Star Hosts**, raise the **Yin Qi**, summon dispersing clouds, and subdue the fire calamity, ensuring it cannot rise again.\n\nMay the households of [specific village] and [specific family] be forever free from fire disasters, their homes secure, their people unharmed, and their fortunes prosperous—thus proving the efficacy of this plea.\n\nWith deepest gratitude to the **Most High Assembly of Worthies**.\n\n**Petition for Mercy**\n\nYour humble servant, on behalf of [name], respectfully submits a *Mouth Chapter* for the **Celestial Officials** to dispel the fire calamity, presented to the **Supreme Court of the [Specific] Palace of the Most High**.\n\nThe **Highest Clarity Merit Chapter** is duly registered in its proper rank. It is hereby declared that, upon reviewing the written petition, it is found that [name], a disciple of [specific state] and [specific county], aged [number], born in the [month] of [year], in deepest reflection, acknowledges his humble origins as one born of mere mortal flesh and blood. By fortune and fate, he has received the **Dao**, surrendered to the **True One**, and been nourished by the four seasons. The **Most High** cherishes life, abhors killing, and has bestowed upon this servant his *qi* and vital essence, extending even to this day. He has been graced by the **Enlightenment of the Sun**, and through the **Teacher’s Way**, has been granted the **Sacred Register**, elevated to recite the *Venerable Lord Lao’s Five Thousand Words on the Dao and Its Virtue*, and received the **Five Caverns’ Teachings**—of the **Cavern of Spirits**, the **Cavern of Mysteries**, the **Cavern of Depths**, and the **Cavern of Truth**. From the day of receipt, he must venerate the **Sacred Texts**, cultivate merit, and establish virtue, aligning himself with the **Immortal Way**, attaining longevity and saving the world, with life eternal and boundless.\n\nEven if he does not ascend to the **Dao**, he may take refuge in the **Great Yin**, undergo alchemical refinement, and be reborn as a **True Person**, escaping the **Three Realms of Suffering**. For the **Dao is weighty, while humanity is light**—this servant’s mortal frame cannot truly embody its principles. Yet, the **Law is vast and open**, a vessel for all beings, saving both heavenly and human lives, nurturing spirits, and guiding them toward the **Mystic Extremes**. Through breathwork and meditation, he seeks the **Supreme Void**, cultivating the **Way within Life**.\n\nWithout proper adherence to the **Law**, there can be no precision, no authenticity. Yet this servant, burdened by sins across countless lifetimes—particularly the grave offenses of the past seven generations—remains ensnared by his karmic bonds, unable to conceal his transgressions. In sincerity, he dares to prostrate himself and humbly declare:\n\nFor the **Five Caverns’ Scriptures** and **Teachings** he bears—including those of the **Five Emperors**, **True Spirits**, **Jade Maidens**, **Direct Symbols**, **Direct Matters**, **Leading Immortal Secretaries**, **Supervising Marshals**, **Officials of the Sun, Moon, and Stars**, the **Five Peaks and Four Rivers**, the **Ten Directions’ True Worthies**, the **Supreme Generals of Law**, and the **Ten Thousand Chariots and Myriad Cavalry**—let them all unite in merit and report their labors, ascending to the **Mystic Metropolis**, advancing in rank to **Highest Grade Immortals**, and receiving imperial honors, with their true names duly recorded, lest they be overlooked.\n\nMay the **seven ancestral parents of this servant** be freed from suffering, ascend to the **Heavenly Realm**, and enjoy natural sustenance, while the world beneath knows great peace.\n\nThis servant’s **Daoic cultivation remains incomplete**; his reverence and practice fall short of the required rites. He has been ensnared by the **Four Departments** and held by the **Five Emperors**, guilty of myriad transgressions. He humbly beseeches forgiveness.\n\nMay the **Five-Bodied True Officials** within this servant’s body, having fulfilled their ranks and duties, return to their proper places within him, preserving his **qi** and **True Essence**, restoring him to stability as before.\n\nWith deepest gratitude to the **Most High Assembly of Worthies**.\n\nMay the **Most High Assembly of Worthies** grant mercy.\n\nThis servant humbly submits a **Functional Report of Daoic Merit** to petition the **Most High Celestial Officials** of the **Taoist Court**. At the **auspicious conjunction of the Three Five** (i.e., the 15-day and 10-day cycles of the lunar calendar), when the **Functional Report** is sealed, he presents his case:\n\nIn accordance with the records, a disciple of the **Daoic Way** from **State X, County Y**, aged **so many years**, born in the **such-and-such** month, through self-reflection and fortune, has been blessed to receive the **Original Grace of the Great Dao** for a thousand years.\n\nThis servant, upon receiving the **Twenty-Four Treatments of Daoic Spirit**, was commissioned as a **General of the Bureau of Soldiers**. On the day of his appointment, he swore to follow his teacher’s instructions, to govern the **soldierly officials** with care, to heal the common folk, and to prioritize saving beings above all else. On this auspicious day of the **Three Five Conjunction**, he now presents this **Functional Report of Merit**.\n\nSince this servant assumed his duties, all his undertakings have been as desired. He now, in strict observance of the **Daoic rites and laws**, submits this **Functional Report of Daoic Merit** on the **auspicious day of the current month**, bearing the **Three Five Supreme Spirit Official—One General Treatment**, the **Three Five Supreme Spirit Official—Ten Generals Treatment**, the **One Hundred and Fifty Generals Treatment**, the **Crimson Heaven Central Bureau—Crimson Treatment**, the **Crimson Heaven Three Divisions—Three Generals Treatment**, the **Summoning of One Hundred Demons Treatment**, the **Chaotic Primordial Naked Treatment**, the **Nine Provinces Community Order Treatment**, the **Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Star Warrior Treatment**, the **Luo River Diagram Treatment**, the **Six Harm-Dispelling Divine Talisman Treatment**, the **Nine Phoenixes—Dispelling Impurity Treatment**, the **Imperial Seal—Completion of the Official Register Treatment**, the **Flowery Canopy Treatment**, the **Nine Heavenly Soldiers Talisman Treatment**, the **Nine Officials—Warding Off Calamities Eight Trigrams Protective Treatment**, the **Summoning for Inspection Treatment**, the **Beheading of Ten Thousand Demons and a Hundred Thousand Spirits Treatment**, the **Great Beheading of Evil Treatment**, the **Four Departments—Binding Qi Treatment**, the **Beheading of Luo River Demons Treatment**, the **Functional Official Treatment**, and the **Long-Life Protective Treatment**—all **Twenty-Four Treatments of Daoic Spirit**—as well as the **Six Jiǔn, Supreme Unity, and Thunder Official—Thirty-Six Divisions of Divine Rites Treatment**, the **Eight Histories—Divine Talismans of the Six Celestial Stems and Ten Heavenly Branches**, the **Twelve Monthly Generals**, the **Twenty-Four Treatments of Daoic Spirit—Vigilant Duty Generals Treatment**, the **Filial Daoic Sage King—Eighteen Stages of Mountain Spirit Generals Treatment**, and the **Central Palace—Daring, Just, and Mighty Generals of the Eight Extremes, Star Warrior, and Six Battles**, including the **Central Yellow—Administrative Officials**, the **Original Yellow—Nine Immortals Administrative Officials**, the **Chief of the Array—Head of Punishment Officials**, the **Head of the Array—Officials of Execution**, the **Disaster-Dispelling, Calamity-Dissolving, Life-Sustaining, and Calamity-Relieving Officials**, the **Heavenly Cavalry Soldiers**, and the **Heavenly Laborers**—all of whom safeguard this servant’s body as before.\n\nThus, this servant’s efforts have made **gold and stone yield**, **water and fire extinguish**, **those he detests submit**, **those he heals recover**, **those he releases are freed**, **those he strikes are vanquished**, and **those he dispels are scattered**. All malevolent demons and evil spirits who seek to harm this servant are utterly destroyed. May this servant be granted to transcend the **Three Calamities and Nine Perils**, to dwell in an age of great peace, and to see all beings reverently submit, welcoming the **Holy Sovereign** and forever serving as his loyal subjects.\n\nHis **excessive gratitude** is his earnest pledge. With deepest gratitude to the **Most High Assembly of Worthies**.\n\nThe **Most High Assembly of Worthies** decrees as follows:\n\nNow, upon the occasion of the **Three Great Assemblies** and the grand celebration, this servant humbly presents a memorial tablet of one copy to the **Three Five Generals**—both inner and outer—who are enshrined within his body, offering prayers and supplications to the **Most High, Three Heavenly Officials**.\n\nThe memorial is duly submitted.\n\nThe **Absolute Peak of Mount Tai** records the **Dead Ledger of the Twelve Lords of Destiny** and the **Register of Merit**. According to the established procedures:\n\nThis servant, in strict accordance with the official records, submits that the **disciple of the Uppermost Pure Dao** of **Three Scenic Lands** from **State X, County Y, Village Z**, **Master [Surname] [Given Name]**, and this servant, **[Surname]**, were born in the year **...**, month **...**, having the rare fortune of being born with the **Dao** within them—an occurrence of a thousand years. The venerable teacher, in his compassion, bestowed upon them the **Treatise of the Dao** and the **Commandments of the Dao**, deeming them not mere commoners, allowing them to wear the **Sacred Talismans** and partake in the **Scriptures of the Dao**. These are profound and mysterious treasures, and the servant’s gratitude knows no bounds.\n\nYet, this servant, though favored by the **Mysterious Dao**, has not observed its precepts and laws, and his merits are nonexistent—his faults and transgressions are piled high. For many years, he has been plagued by misfortune, his life path unfulfilled, his dwelling unstable, his fate entrusted to the **Twelve Lords of Destiny** under the **Imperial Heaven** and **Most High Assembly**.\n\nIn strict accordance with the ancient rites of the **Heavenly Master**, on this auspicious day of the **Three Great Assemblies**, this servant humbly requests:\n\n- The **Dead Ledger of Mount Tai** be severed,\n- The **name of death and the record of transgressions** be expunged from the **Right Contract**,\n- His **Ledger of Life** be amended,\n- His **name of birth** be inscribed in the **Left Contract of the Palace of Eternal Life**.\n\nThis servant further petitions for the assignment of one **Officer of the Granary** (倉生君 *cāngshēng jūn*), to serve as the **Three Officials’ General**, **clerks**, and **soldiers**, recording all merits and receiving rewards as customary. May the **Most High Assembly** pardon this servant’s errors and misdeeds, and grant great **virtue/power** to his deceased relatives and those suffering in the **Six Realms of Rebirth**, ensuring their sustenance and comfort, the cessation of calamities and illnesses, the descent of **Dao qi**, and a serene fate for both the living and the dead.\n\nThis is the servant’s solemn vow to repay the **excessive gratitude** owed.\n\nWith deepest gratitude to the **Most High of Mount Tai** and the **Three Heavenly Officials**.\n\nOn this auspicious **Three Assembly** day in accordance with the **Law**, this servant humbly submits a petition to the **Celestial Officials**, praying for the removal of the **Mount Tai death register** and the rectification of the **living records**, along with a **supplication scroll, ink, brush, and seal**—one copy—to be presented to the **Celestial Clerk’s Office** of the **Most High [Divine Name]**.\n\nTo **transfer and deliver** the merit-recording memorial for the deceased, duly registered in the **Law’s ranks**, this servant reports:\n\n*\"In accordance with the scriptures, [this servant], a disciple of the **Upper Clarity Three Caverns and Three Landscapes** at the **Celestial Purity Hall** of [certain] prefecture and county, [name] Mr. [Surname] of [Mountain], born in the [year, month], originally conceived by **womb-birth**, fortunate to have lived a thousand years, now devoted to the **Great Dao**, further graced by the **Celestial Official’s** bestowal of the **Treatise of the Celestial Clerk**, and honored to hold the **Precious Scripture** for the sake of **supporting and nourishing** [the Dao].\n\nThis servant, cherishing the **Dao** and delighting in life, proclaims the scriptures, aiding the state and sustaining fate, exhorting the myriad people and commoners—all benefiting from the **Most High’s Great Dao** and the **Heavenly Officials’ profound kindness**.\n\nIt is heard that on the **Great Dao’s** auspicious **Three Assembly** day, the **Most High Venerable Lord** descends to the **Eight Extremes**, his blessings vast and boundless.\n\nThis servant’s deceased **three generations of ancestors, five generations of forebears, seven generations of parents, those who died before and after, and all five degrees of kin**—some may yet suffer in the **Hell of Punishment**, unable to descend and be liberated—beg the **Great Dao’s Celestial Official** and the **Superior Registrar**, that this servant’s current memorial may reach the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**, the **Twenty-Four Prisons of Mount Tai**, the **Nine Equal Prisons of the Central Yellow**, the **Central Capital Great Prison**, the **Water Official’s Earthly Bureau**, the **Nine Rivers’ Water Emperor**, **Lord Lübo of the Yellow River**, and their **attendants, clerks, and convicts**—all those condemned to **five oaths and seven curses**, guilty of **disloyalty and filial disobedience**, harboring **hidden malevolence and sins**—from Heaven to Earth, all may be **pardoned**.\n\nMay this servant’s studies flourish, wisdom expand, past offenses be forgiven, and rewards bestowed, ensuring the **peace of both the living and the dead**, as a **pledge of sincerity**.\n\nWith deepest gratitude to the **Most High’s** **distinctive blessings**.\"*\n\nOn this day of the third gathering, auspicious and joyous, I, [name], humbly present this petition to the Most High, seeking to ascend and reach my three ancestral grandfathers, five ancestral grandmothers, and seven generations of parents.\n\nI now submit this petition to the **Most High’s Three Celestial Departments** as follows:\n\nHaving paid respects, I report:\n\nThe common folk, burdened with grievances, have composed this petition in strict accordance with the prescribed rites. I state:\n\nFollowing the ancient rites of the Celestial Master, I, as the **Three Gatherings’ Chief Administrator** of my residence, lead the household and transform the people. In accordance with the Celestial Master’s scriptures, I have ceased speaking of death and instead proclaimed life. Together with the **Celestial Master’s former officials**—the **Two Mysterious, Three Primordial, and Four Beginnings** officials, the **Twenty-Four Treatments’ officials**, and their generals, clerks, soldiers, and attendants—I now declare my merits and request advancement.\n\nI have gathered in strict observance of the prohibitions, daring not to neglect the assemblies.\n\nWith utmost reverence, I list in my locality at **[specific place]**, within the **Buying [Observation] Hall of the Village Register**, the households and transformed people—both men and women—under my charge. I seek blessings and make supplications, bearing the **Orthodox One’s Oath of Allegiance** and its accompanying talismans, the **Twenty-Four Stages**, and the **Seventy-Five Boy Talismans**, along with the scattered common folk. I pray to the **Supreme Mysterious Elder**, the **Most High’s Three Venerable Generals**, their officers, soldiers, and guards of the estate, and the **Three Generals’ Three Hundred Thousand Soldiers** to protect my household—men, women, and children—so that the **three calamities and nine afflictions** may be dispelled as per this petition.\n\nFurthermore, I pray for my **internal and external kindred**, both living and deceased, and for the talismans I bear: those who have perished and those who have transformed, male and female spirits alike, to be **ascended and reached**, spared from all suffering, and elevated to the **Celestial Realm**, severing all ties of reincarnation. May my lingering illnesses be cured, my days grow ever stable, and my wishes fulfilled by the Most High’s grace, as a **pledge of sincerity**.\n\nMay the **Most High’s distinctive blessings** be upon me.\n\n**Translation:**\n\n---\n\nIn accordance with the standard ritual, I now humbly present this petition on the auspicious day of the **Three Assemblies** this **year, month, and day**, declaring my merits and deeds.\n\nI submit this petition for imperial edict.\n\n**Chapter Four of the *Zhongliu* of the Red Pine Immortal** concluded.\n**Chapter Five of the *Zhongliu* of the Red Pine Immortal**—\n**The Petition for Merits to the Celestial and Terrestrial Deities**—\nHaving duly prepared the ritual station, I humbly report:\n\nAccording to the written records, the Daoist **certain** of **certain prefecture, county, and township**, born of the **Taoist embryo**, has been graced by the **Celestial Bureau’s** bestowal of sacred talismans, both inner and outer, in an act of boundless favor.\n\nAs Your unworthy servant, my passions are unrestrained, my awareness obscured, and my sins have accumulated over years—countless and irredeemable. Yet, I rely upon the divine talismans received within my person, their protection ever-present, their grace profound. Prostrate before the Celestial Throne, I submit this petition in reverence.\n\nThrough the **Most High’s Supreme Dao**, the **Honored Lords and Ladies**, and the **Celestial Master’s Consort**, I beseech forgiveness for my myriad sins—past and present, across lifetimes—along with my past and present deeds: relieving the calamities of the common folk, healing their illnesses, responding to their urgent petitions, establishing fasting rituals, and performing meritorious acts. All my supplications and requests—whether for the **Celestial Bureau’s** officials and soldiers, the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**, or the **spirits of the land and waterways**, the **pathways of the six directions**, and the **officials of prefectures, counties, townships, villages, and neighborhoods**—who have aided the Dao and promoted its transformation—from the **first to the tenth month** of this year, I pray that those who have rendered service to the **Celestial Bureau’s** soldiers and officials may be **reported for merit**, their ranks elevated from **first to hundredth**, and from **hundredth to thousandth**, in accordance with the **Celestial Bureau’s classifications**. May they be recorded in the **Registry of Merit**, assigned stable positions, and never left in despair or resentment.\n\nWhen the **Celestial, Earthly, and Water Officials** have completed their duties, may they each return to their proper stations.\n\nFurthermore, from the **first to the twelfth month**, and for all the **lords, generals, and soldiers** I have invoked, I now declare their merits.\n\nFrom the **first to the thirtieth day of each month**, and for all the **lords, generals, and soldiers** I have invoked, I now declare their merits.\n\nFrom the **hour of *zi* to the hour of *hai*** for all the **lords, generals, and soldiers** I have invoked, I now declare their merits.\n\nMay all be **promoted in rank**, in accordance with the **Celestial Bureau’s classifications**, and none left in suffering or regret.\n\nThe **talismanic soldiers and officials** shall, at their appointed times, continue to guard my person as before.\n\nI humbly pray that the **Most High’s Supreme Dao**, the **Honored Lords and Ladies**, and the **Celestial Master’s Consort** may descend their **authentic vital qi**, enveloping my body, preserving my **true vitality**, curing my lingering illnesses, strengthening my limbs, causing the **Three Corpses** to wither and the **Nine Vermin** to perish, enabling me to **cultivate the Dao and dwell in spirit**, my mind enlightened and my understanding awakened, foreknowledge granted, **longevity secured**, and **immortality attained**, so that I may **cross the mortal world as a transcendent** and witness the **Age of Great Peace**.\n\nMay my household—great and small—be spared from calamity, my lifespan extended, and the **Five Plagues** and poisons dare not approach.\n\nBy the **auspicious day of next year, month, and day**, when my wishes are fulfilled, I shall present this **petition for merits** to the assembled officials, fulfilling my pledge of sincerity.\n\nMay the **Most High’s distinct blessings** be upon my humble and unworthy self.\n\nI now, through the **Direct Envoys of the Two Bureaus**, the **Functionary of Merit for the Orthodox Unity**, the **Left and Right Official Envoys**, the **Divinatory Clerks of Yin and Yang**, the **Clerks of the Scarlet Talismans**, and the **Mounted Couriers of the Just Wind**,—each in pairs—operating under my authority during the **Three Assemblies’ auspicious rites**, for the **deities of Heaven and Earth**, as well as the **soldiers and officials within my person**, who have together attended to the **past and present sufferings of the common folk**, I submit this **oral and written petition for merits** to the **Three Celestial Bureaus**, awaiting their edict.\n\nYour unworthy servant, **certain**, in deepest awe and terror, prostrates, bows, and kneels twice in submission.\n\n**[Three blank lines]**\n\nYour unworthy servant, **certain**, belonging to **Certain Palace** for the **Dao/Way’s merit offerings**,\n\n**[Three blank lines]**\n**Supreme Dao/Way of the Highest Purity, the Most Exalted and Original Way, the Boundless Great Dao/Way of the Three Celestial Bureaus, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Lord, the Heavenly Emperor, the Nine Old Immortal Lords of the Nine Old Dao/Way, the Hundred Thousand Millionfold Dao/Way’s Immortal Qi, the Thousand Two Hundred Official Immortal Lords, the Supreme Lord’s Golden Threshold of Seven Treasures and Jade—**\n\n**[Three blank lines]**\nIn the **Year Title of the Year Cycle of [certain]**, the **Month of [certain]**, the **[certain] day of the month]**, the **[certain] branch of the sexagenary cycle]**, at the **[certain] hour** in **[certain location]**, at the **fasting altar**, your unworthy servant, **certain** of the **Dao/Way’s merit-offering functionary rank**, humbly submits this **petition for merits** in written form.\n\n**[Three blank lines]**\nIt may be **recorded** and **used as a complete sheet** for this purpose.\n\n**Supreme Dao/Way of the Highest Purity, the Most Exalted and Original Way, the Boundless Great Dao/Way of the Three Celestial Bureaus, the Golden Threshold of Seven Treasures and Jade—**\n\nYour unworthy servant, **[certain surname] [certain name]**, of the **Dao/Way’s merit-offering functionary rank**, submits this **petition** and **seals it** in the **inner envelope**,\nHumbly, humbly, **presents it** to the **Supreme Dao/Way’s Palace of the Void and the Formless**,\n**[certain] Bureau overseer** of **[certain] Palace**,\n**[inner envelope]**, humbly, humbly, **presents it** to the **Dao/Way’s merit-offering functionary rank**,\n**[certain surname] [certain name]**, humbly **reseals it** in submission.\n\n**To the Three Celestial Bureaus, requesting entry: [three lines of merit-petition]**,\n**Dao/Way’s merit-offering functionary rank**,\n\n**Supplication:**\n\nYour unworthy servants, born of vulgar times yet blessed by past merit, now behold the Great Transformation and take refuge in the Dao/Way. By Heaven’s and Earth’s nurture—nourished by the Red Spirit, fostered by the Yellow Emperor, guarded by stars, illuminated by sun and moon, sustained by the four seasons—we have received the breath of life and attained humanity. Though unworthy, we dare to crave the Dao/Way’s teachings, surrendering to the Most True. By imperial grace, we were granted the precepts, inner and outer talismans, the Three Five offices, and the Three Caverns’ Golden Scripts and Jade Tablets. Since receiving these, we have devoted years to incense, lamps, and offerings.\n\nYet the Dao/Way is weighty while mortals are frail—how dare we bear such sacred trust? Night and day, we tremble in dread, unable to rest. From the day we received the law, we vowed to exhaust our feeble talents: morning and evening rites, chanting, proclaiming virtue, and saving all beings. We would also cultivate the self in stillness, drawing the sun’s essence into the heart’s void, refining the *qi* of practice through nine transformations of yin and yang, alchemizing the Five and Three into elixir, soaring through the void, ascending in broad daylight.\n\nIf our practice lacks precision, if our Dao/Way is untrue, we fear our past and present lives have committed the gravest offenses. We humbly beseech the **Divine Functionary of Merit** and the **Celestial Officers of Arms**, that they guard our bodies, prolong the lives of our green-robed kin, and shield our households.\n\nWe further petition for:\n- **One Marshal of Divine Protection**,\n- **One Hundred and Twenty Officers of Arms**,\nto bear wondrous elixirs—sweet *lingzhi* mushrooms, golden nectar, jade essence—to nourish our offspring, secure the nation’s spirit, and ensure no harm befall them.\n\nMay we, your unworthy servants, ascend as immortals, attain eternal life, and traverse the world unharmed. When we move or rest, we beg these officers and soldiers to guard us faithfully, lest we prove unworthy of your grace.\n\n**Humbly, we implore the Most High’s discernment.**\n\nSo this year, on the third auspicious gathering of the month, it is said that merit is ascended and positions are transferred. With the first chapter of the register opened, I humbly petition the **Divine Functionary of the Three Heavens** thus:\n\nI have removed the **Tàishān Death Register** chapter of my former transgressions and fulfilled the requisite **Lawful Rank**. I now declare: In accordance with the written records, I, your unworthy servant [of such-and-such name], in the year of [so many], belonged to the prefecture, county, and township of [so-and-so]. By virtue of my birth from the womb, my past green-robed fortune, and the favor of the **Twelve Celestial Lords of Destiny**, I am now under the protection of the **Supreme Dao**.\n\nIn compliance with the celestial ordinances, on this third auspicious gathering’s auspicious day, I have been struck from the **Tàishān Death Register**, severing all binding contracts.\n\nI further petition the **Lord of the Granary** and the **Eight Extremes Five Qi Overseers of Destiny**, that they extend to me and my green-robed kin—both great and small—the longevity of **thirty-six thousand years**, inscribe our names in the **Jade Register of Heaven**, and weave our threads through the cosmos. From this moment onward, within three months and one day, I shall fulfill the merit of ascending and transferring ranks, my name added to the celestial hierarchy, to repay my labors and devotion, and not fail in my pledge of fidelity.\n\nMay all—your unworthy servant and my green-robed household, from eldest to youngest, from high to low—thus receive this grace, our destinies prolonged forever, as eternal descendants of Heaven.\n\nThough I bear countless faults and sins, I beg for mercy and absolution. **Humbly, I await the Most High’s discernment.**\n\nThe **Flying Dragon Officials** and the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, each eighteen in number, now present me with a memorial petition in accordance with this year’s month and day, solemnly beseeching the removal of my name from the **Dead Register of Mount Tai**. I submit this memorial to the **Celestial Hall of the Most High**.\n\nFor the **memorial of the departed’s merit**, I humbly declare:\nIn accordance with the records, I, **[Name]**, of the year **[Year]**, reside in **[State]-[County]-[Village]-[Precinct]**. By virtue of being born of mortal flesh and blood, I have traversed a thousand-year cycle of destiny, yet in this age of the **Most High’s Enlightened Dao**, I have encountered the **Alliance of the Sacred and the Rectification of the Teachings**, driving away filth and rebellion.\n\nYet I, **[Name]**, am born with **obscure and dull qi**, my six senses stifled, my hundred virtues flawed, and I have no merit to offer in return to the **Great Creator**. It is said that the **Dao’s law** decrees that on auspicious days of the **Three Assemblies**, the **Most High Lord Lao**’s grace flows to the **Eight Extremes**, his blessings permeating all. Thus, both the living and the dead are enfolded in mercy.\n\nTherefore, I now submit this memorial to the **Three Celestial Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**, the **Nine River Water Emperor**, **River Spirit**, and their attendants, beseeching them to grant me this favor: that all my **seven generations of ancestors**, both the **predeceased and those who have passed in spirit**, may be absolved of all past sins and grave offenses. May they be **pardoned and released**, granted **ritual purification**, and ascend to the **Office of Immortal Life in the Mysterious Capital**, their spirits ascending to the **Purple Enclosure**, where sustenance and raiment shall be naturally provided.\n\nMay my entire lineage thus receive the **abiding blessings**, with boundless fortune and longevity, our names inscribed in the **Jade Register’s Green Pages**, both the living and the dead secure in peace, forever as **eternal descendants of Heaven**, shining forth the **Kingly Dao’s pure and true faith**.\n\nI await the **Most High’s discernment**.\n\n---\n\nThe **Divine Officials of Yin-Yang**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, each eighteen in number, now present my memorial on this auspicious day, solemnly beseeching the **transfer and absolution of my departed ancestors’ karmic burdens and exiled punishments**. This memorial is submitted to the **Celestial Hall of the Most High**.\n\n**Memorial of Merit for the Departed** (submitted in the third month, at the appointed hour).\n\n**Memorial of Merit for the Departed (Continued)**\n\nHaving established my **lawful station**, I humbly submit:\n\nIn accordance with the **Mysterious Teachings**, it is recorded that the **Most High’s Dao-qi** has transformed all beings born of the womb—each with their coarse and impure essence—through its boundless grace, extending to the eight extremes. By bestowing **Dao-law** and nurturing all life, I, through fortune, have returned to the **Law-gate**. The **Celestial Master**, in compassion, has granted me this office.\n\nYet, with my base and vulgar nature, my senses dull and unassisted, I lack the means to aid others. Night and day, I tremble in anxiety, unable to find peace.\n\nIn accordance with the **Sacred Scriptures**, the **Celestial Master’s** decrees mandate three annual assemblies of merit, particularly on the fifth day of the tenth month, when all **Meritorious Deeds** are proclaimed.\n\nI now enumerate the **talismans** under my charge, detailing their **Dao-words** and edicts: the **common folk and cultivated beings**, male and female, noble and lowly—all registered by **command, household, age, rank, and name**, as listed below.\n\nSince the seventh day of the seventh month of this year, I have received the **Most High’s Three Celestial Dao of the Limitless**, the **Lords and Masters of the Law**, and the **Celestial Master’s Teachings**, instructing the people, healing the sick, and aiding the nation’s fate. Even the **fleshly beings** have abandoned vice for virtue, forsaken rebellion for obedience, cast off the old for the new, and discarded falsehood for truth.\n\nAs **Functionary of the Military and Divine Officials**, **Divine Decisor of Yin-Yang**, and **Keeper of the Twelve Hundred Official Spirits**, I petition the **Heavenly Officers and Military**, the **Mars and Venus Battalions**, the **Ghostly Qi Officials**, the **Supreme Pure Lord**, the **Five Qi Scripture Lords**, the **Vermilion Bird Lord**, the **Heavenly Physicians of Sun and Moon**, the **Harmonizing Physicians**, the **Daring and Vigorous Officials of the Primordial**, the **Lords of the Hundred Creatures**, the **Divine Males and Females**, the **Mysterious Males and Females**, the **Jade Males and Females**, the **Plain Males and Females**, the **Immortal Males and Females**, and the **Deceptive Officials and Transfiguring Lords**—that they heal sickness, resolve disputes, bless travel, oversee marriages and burials, and grant protection to supplicants.\n\nWithin my jurisdiction, the **Supervisory and Summoning Officials**, the **Two Mysterious, Three Primordial, and Four Beginning Lords**, and the **Four Wilds, Five Wilds, and Seven Wilds of the Levelled Districts** oversee the **fields, silkworms, and livestock**, providing double protection.\n\nThe **Celestial Master’s** appointed **Twenty-Four Administrations**, the **Thirty-Six Pacifying Lodges**, and the **Nine Regions and Eight Extremes’ Lords and Officials**, along with the **Five Directions’ Exorcising Lords and Officials**—the **Eastern Nine Yi**, the **Southern Eight Man**, the **Western Six Rong**, the **Northern Five Di**, and the **Central Three Qin**—and the **Yellow Book Commanders of the Twelve Monthly Decrees**, both **Male and Female Officials**, the **Twenty-Four Officials**, the **Male and Female Roles**, and the **Twenty-Four Roles**, as well as the **Household Talisman Officials** under their charge, petition the **Three Generals of the Residence** and the **Twenty-Four Officials**, along with **Three Hundred Thousand Soldiers**, the **Three Ancestral Generations and Five Ancestral Generations**, and the **Five Generals and Five Spirits**—that they safeguard the **fleshly beings’ households**, ensuring all remain upright.\n\nTo the **Laboring Lords and Exhausted Officials**, I pray that all may be **proclaimed for merit and promoted**.\n\nAs my understanding of **ghostly qi** is deficient, I humbly request the **Han Southern昌 Assembly Lords** and the **Restoration of Merit Lords**, along with **One Hundred Twenty Officials**, to oversee the **ranking of all officials**. Those with merit shall be **promoted accordingly**, their **ghostly qi** examined and rectified—from the **Ten Grades up to the Hundredth**, and from the **Thousandth up to the Ten Thousandth**—ascending to the **Central Palace** in proportion to their deeds, each returning to their original station.\n\nFor those **displaying merit**, let them be assigned to the **Convenience Bureau** with stable positions, lest they lose hope. Should any harbor resentment, let them be **proclaimed for merit and promoted** by the fifth day of the first month next year.\n\nI and the **Dao-citizens** under my charge shall **recite the names in order**, as proof of sincerity.\n\nFor my countless sins and transgressions, I beseech **forgiveness from the Most High**.\n\n**Awaiting the Most High’s decree.**\n\n**Memorial of Merit and Function for the Triple Assembly**\n\nHumble Daoist of [Certain] Prefecture and County, [Name], aged [X], born in the [month] of [year], prostrates and respectfully memorializes:\n\nTo the Most High Laozi, Celestial Master, Successor Master, Lineage Master, the Three Masters and their Consorts, and the Officials of the Gate:\n\nI, [Name], a thousandfold fortunate, have encountered the Mysterious Wind and presumptuously entered the Dao-gate. Clad in the robes of the Way, I have been graciously initiated by the Venerable Teachers, granted sacred scriptures to rectify my life, and thus ascended from the first stage of Zhengyi to the utmost realm of Shangqing.\n\nAlas, though my nature is coarse and the Law refined, my transgressions are vast. I neglect morning and evening incense-offerings, fail to observe the New Moon and Full Moon rites, miss the Triple Assembly and Triple Meeting rituals, and violate the solemnities of the Eight Festivals and Regengshen days. My body has been impure, clashing with the Celestial Officials; my words have betrayed my thoughts, violating statutes and prohibitions. Sometimes my mind wanders, generating vain fantasies; at others, my joy and anger are untimed, my drink and food excessive.\n\nSuch crimes are boundless, without measure—day by day, month by month, with no means to purify them. Now, on the auspicious day of the Triple Assembly in the year [X], I humbly present this **Memorial of Merit and Function for the Great Law** (one copy) and the **Memorial of Merit and Function for the Mixed Five and Seven Scriptures** (one copy), along with my offerings.\n\nI pray that the Most High Three Sages and the Celestial Masters, in their boundless mercy, extend their boundless grace, washing away my past sins and absolving my former offenses. May I also beseech that the sacred scriptures I bear—such as the *Zhengyi Dongyuan* and others, including those of Shangqing, Shangxian, Shangling, the Two Officials and Soldiers, the Celestial Children and Jade Maidens, and the Civil and Martial Attendants—all speak of my merit and labor on my behalf, advancing my rank and bestowing rewards. When the merit is received, may all return to my person, soothing the officials and guarding my body.\n\nMay calamities and disasters be dispelled, decline and peril extinguished; may slander cease, and grudges harmonize. May the talismans, ritual texts, and sacred waters take effect. May my disciples flourish, and my abode remain serene. May my comings and goings be secure, and my petitions be granted.\n\nI await the **Mysterious Creation’s** decree and respectfully submit this memorial.\n\n**Memorial of the Acendency (Mengdu):**\n[List of ritual positions and ranks]\n\n「Memorial of the Upper Court:\n\nIn humility, I follow the written records: in the state of [blank] and county of [blank], I now prostrate myself and respectfully kneel to beseech mercy, offering this memorial for the redemption of the departed.\n\nI have heard that the **Most High** [i.e., the Jade Emperor] possesses the **Dao** of salvation and deliverance for the departed. I now earnestly submit myself to the **Great Dao**, yet I am unaware whether the departed [name] has, since their recent passing, found rebirth through which **path**.\n\nI fear that during their lifetime, they were among the **common folk**, consuming the **qi** of all beings, slaughtering and tormenting life—all of which are grave offenses.\n\nNow I request the submission of a **Memorial of the Acendency (Mengdu)** for the redemption of their sins, accompanied by the **lawful credentials** as evidence.\n\nYour servant, [name], in this memorial, humbly hopes that the **Most High’s Boundless Dao**, the **Heavenly Master** [i.e., the Daoist deity], the **Merciful Father** and **Holy Mother**, and the **Supreme Officials**, will graciously extend their boundless compassion and forgive the departed’s past transgressions—whether from their **three karma** and **six emotions**, or from accumulated sins of the utmost severity, or from violations of the **180 Conditions of Offense** [i.e., the 180 major sins in Buddhist and Daoist cosmology], leading to endless cycles of **reincarnation** in the **dark realm** of eternal night.\n\nI am uncertain whether the departed’s **soul** and **spirit** are now enslaved to labor under which **official** or confined in the **Twenty-Four Hells**, the **Three Rivers**, or the **Nine Rivers** [of the underworld], or whether they suffer the **Wind Knife’s punishment** [i.e., the torment of the underworld], bound in the **Three Abysses** [of suffering]. I pray for clarification.\n\nYour servant now presents this **petition for salvation**, beseeching Your grace to grant the departed [name]’s **soul** ascension to the **Three Heavens**, their **spirit** release from the **dark domain**, and eternal freedom from suffering, wandering at ease in the **blessed halls**. May their **clothing** and **food** be provided naturally, and may they receive **heavenly joys** in the **Celestial Realm**.\n\nFurther, I pray that my family, both **elders** and **young**, may forever enjoy **prosperity and well-being**, and that all our desires may be fulfilled according to our hearts, always safeguarded by **original good fortune**. May this serve as a testament to Your grace.\n\nAwaiting Your decree,\nYour servant, [name], submits this memorial.\n**Memorial of the Acendency (Mengdu):**\n[List of ritual positions and ranks]\n\n**The Lawful Credentials:**\n[Details of the ritual rank and position]」\n\n**Memorial for the Purification of Life and Death (Shengsi Jiexi Yedan Jieshe):**\n\n**Supplication to the Most High:**\n\nIn accordance with the sacred writ, the [name] of [state/county], along with their entire household—elders and young, numbering [X]—now prostrate in homage, pledging allegiance to the **Most High**.\n\nFearing the **defilement and impurity** of the living residence due to recent mortality, we submit this memorial for **purification and cleansing**. Within this dwelling, the **twelve earthly branches** and the **native life-qi** of the deceased conflict with the **harmful qi** of the living, causing turmoil.\n\nWe humbly beseech Your **decree** to purify this household’s **courtyard and halls**, dispelling all **defilement and impurity**, so that the interior and exterior may radiate **clarity and brightness**. May the **divine dragons** stand guard, protecting the residents.\n\nWith unwavering devotion, we invoke the **Great Dao/Way**, praying that this memorial may **cleanse the dwelling** and **dissolve all defilement**, ensuring lasting **tranquility and safety** as we have stated.\n\nThough unworthy, we lack understanding of **cosmic cycles and auspicious timing**, yet we accept Your command. Kneeling in submission, we present this memorial, that it may ascend to the **Celestial Tribunals**.\n\nWe further petition the **Most High** to command:\n- The **Green Sovereign (Qingdi)** of the East, **Purification Lord (Jiexi Jun)**,\n- The **Red Sovereign (Chidi)** of the South, **Purification Lord (Jiexi Jun)**,\n- The **White Sovereign (Baidi)** of the West, **Purification Lord (Jiexi Jun)**,\n- The **Black Sovereign (Heidi)** of the North, **Purification Lord (Jiexi Jun)**,\n- The **Yellow Sovereign (Huangdi)** of the Center, **Purification Lord (Jiexi Jun)**,\n\nto dispatch **one hundred twenty officials** below their rank, who shall **wash and purify the fleshly remains**, removing all **salted defilement**.\n\nAdditionally, we request the **Jade Maiden Messengers (Yunü Shizhe)**, numbering **one hundred twenty**, each bearing **true essence water (Zhenjing zhishui)** and **five-harmony incense (Wuhé xiang)**, to sprinkle and cleanse the **tortoises and spirits** of [name]’s household well, so that the **great defilement** enters the sea and the **small defilement** flows into the rivers. All **ten thousand defilements and myriad impurities** shall vanish at once.\n\nWe also petition the **One Thousand Two Hundred Celestial Flowers Maidens (Xianhua Yunü)**, along with the **Water Commanders**:\n- **Green Dragon Sovereign (Qinglong Zhuanshuai)** of the East,\n- **Red Dragon Sovereign (Chilong Zhuanshuai)** of the South,\n- **White Dragon Sovereign (Bailong Zhuanshuai)** of the West,\n- **Black Dragon Sovereign (Heilong Zhuanshuai)** of the North,\n- **Yellow Dragon Sovereign (Huanglong Zhuanshuai)** of the Center,\n\neach bearing **true essence water**, to **wash and purify the divine spirits** of [name]’s household residence—both interior and exterior—rendering them **spotless and auspicious**. We further command **Lord Lu (Lübó)**, **River Marshal (Hèbǎ)**, and all **water officials and attendants**, to relay this decree and ensure the **divine spirits and true essences** of [name]’s household are cleansed, safeguarding the residents with **beneficent protection**.\n\nFor all—elders and young, numbering [X]—we pray for **freedom from calamity and pestilence**, that the residence may remain **peaceful and secure**, and that all future paths be **unobstructed**. May the **Five Plagues** never afflict them, and may their **native life-qi** flow freely in all four directions, perpetually shielded from harm. This shall serve as a testament to Your grace.\n\nAwaiting Your decree,\nYour servant, [name], submits this memorial.\n\n**Translation:**\n\n**Supreme Decree as Above.**\n**Memorial for Residence Pacification Ritual**\n\nHaving duly arranged the ritual formation,\nWe humbly submit this memorial in accordance with the written decree.\nFrom **[State] [County] [Name]**, we now petition for grace,\nWith sincere devotion and prostration, our words laid bare:\nThough unworthy, we have summoned misfortune through our own deeds.\nSince construction began on this residence,\nNo pacification rites have been performed—\nLest the earthwork and labor disturb the resident deities,\nAnd harm the household’s life-qi, lifespan, and silkworm chambers.\nDaring not to act unilaterally, we now respectfully request\nThe **Twelve Taboos of Residence Pacification** in written form,\nTo safeguard the household’s well-being as listed.\n\nWith singular devotion, we invoke the **Dao**,\nAnd through this petition, seek Your benevolent response,\nThat the sacred teachings may be verified and applied,\nTo demonstrate the efficacy of the rites before the Five Directions’ Spirits.\n\nWe further petition the **Celestial Officials** to designate\nFor **[Name]’s Residence** the **Twelve Taboos of the Twenty-Four Solar Terms**,\nThe **Great General of the Year-Pillar (Tàisuì Dàjiāngjūn)**,\nThe **Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior**,\nThe **Hidden Dragon within the residence, Sunrise and Sunset Deities**,\nThe household’s life-qi and lifespan, and all resident spirits—\nNone of whom have yet received ritual pacification.\nOn a chosen auspicious day, we shall solemnly install the ritual seat in the courtyard,\nLay out the sacred tokens,\nAnd declare the residence’s **Twelve Taboos of the Twenty-Four Solar Terms**,\nDividing and resolving their prohibitions.\n\nWe now prostrate and submit this memorial in supplication to the **Celestial Tribunals**.\nMay the overseeing officials deign to inspect this matter.\nIf Your grace is granted, we shall further petition for:\n- **Five Heavenly Officials** (to oversee the petition),\n- **Five Residence-Construction Officials**,\n- **Five Earth-Settling Officials**,\nAnd their subordinate officers—**one hundred twenty in total**,\nAlong with **ten thousand generals**,\nAnd a combined force of **twenty-four officers and thirty thousand soldiers**,\nAs well as the resident deities of this domain and their subordinate territorial spirits,\nTo jointly oversee and bind:\nThe **Four Directions, Eight Sides, Interior and Exterior, Twelve Taboos of the Twenty-Four Solar Terms**,\nThe **Earth Deities, Year-Pillar General, Dark Moon Lady (Tàiyīn Fūrén)**,\nThe **Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior**,\nThe **Hidden Dragon and its Coiling**,\nThe **Great and Minor Years, the Two Exhaustions and Three Officials**,\nThe **Nine Ministers and Generals, Theft-Deities, and Lifespan Deities**,\nThe **Twelve Earthly Branches (Zi-Hai)**—\nAll spirits within and without the residence—\nThat they may, from this day onward, comply with the rites,\nRetract their influence over the **Twelve Solar Terms’ taboos**,\nAnd be bound to their proper stations.\nWe further pray for the **West, South, and North** to be secured,\nThat no transgressions occur.\n\nOnce construction is complete, we shall report our merits and labor,\nAs testament to the purification of all resident spirits,\nThe pacification of the residence and its halls,\nThe gathering of wealth and silks in abundance,\nIn strict accordance with the ritual teachings,\nTo repel calamities from all four directions,\nThat they may never again intrude.\nWith unified devotion, this shall serve as proof of efficacy.\n\n**Awaiting Your decree,**\n**Supreme Decree as Above.**\n\n**Petition for the Opening of the Dao/Way’s Path**\n\nWith proper ritual implements and sacred positions established,\nWe humbly state:\n\nIn strict accordance with the written records,\n[State] **X** Province, **X** County, **[Name of Petitioner]**, the entire household—elders and young alike—\nUnite in heart and bow our heads in reverence,\nKneeling and supplicating for Your mercy with words.\n\nBut alas, the ancestral tomb and residence of **[Name of Deceased]** have fallen into decay and misfortune,\nAs spirits and ghosts encroach, bringing calamity upon themselves.\nTheir sins invite suffering, and they drag the departed’s name into it,\nCausing **[Name of Deceased]** to perish prematurely—\nAt the age of **[X]** years,\nIn **[X] month**, on **[X] day**, at **[X] hour**,\nStricken by illness, burdened by suffering beyond remedy,\nAnd thus they passed away.\n\nWe have followed customary rites,\nEncoffining the body within the hall,\nCompleting all final arrangements.\n\nYet we cannot discern where **[Name of Deceased’s]** soul has taken refuge since their passing,\nFor fear that in their former life,\nThey may have harmed living beings,\nDamaged the vital **qi** of things,\nAnd been bound to the **Three Paths of Retribution**,\nUnreleased from their torments.\n\nWe know not what merit or virtue/power to perform,\nTo redeem them from the netherworld’s confines.\n\nWe have heard that the **Supreme Dao/Way** has provisions for liberation and redemption,\nAnd methods to rescue lost souls.\nWith reverence, we present our **ritual oath** and offerings,\nTo the **Five Directions’ Spirit Officials**,\nAnd earnestly petition for the release of **[Name of Deceased’s]** soul,\nThat their path be opened in darkness,\nUnobstructed by any hindrance.\n\nWith all beings now in harmony of heart,\nWe submit this request for Your approval.\n\nYet, as mere mortals, we lack understanding of the **cosmic qi** and its rhythms.\nWe beg Your benevolence to grant us mercy and relief.\n\nWe humbly petition the **Supreme Dao/Way** to dispatch the **General of the White Horse and Plain Carriage** (one person) and the **Lord of the Great Darkness** (one person), each accompanied by their **officers and attendants** (one hundred twenty persons).\n\nWe further request that **direct talismans** be sent to the **Spirit Officials of the Three Realms**—Heaven, Earth, and Water—**Lady Qing**, **Lord Shao** (of the Book of Destiny), the **Earthly Official of Two Thousand Stone**, the **Chief of the Mound** and **Mound Marshal**, the **Twelve Tomb Lords**, the **Twenty-Four Prisons of Mount Tai**, the **Nine Prisons of the Imperial Sky**, the **Northern Prison of Tianyi**, **Mount Tai of the Eastern Peak**, **Mount Heng of the Southern Peak**, **Mount Hua of the Western Peak**, the **Northern Prison of Mount Heng**, and the **Central Peak, Mount Song** (Prisons of the Earthly Realm), as well as the **Prisons of the Northern Cold Realm**, the **Prisons of the Taolian** (and all other penal abodes), the **Water Emperor of the Nine Rivers**, **River Marshal** and **River Lord**, their **subordinates and clerks**, to **release all departed souls** without fail.\n\nWe earnestly pray that the **sins and burdens** of their lifetime may be **pardoned and erased**, and that any **transgressions or faults** after death may be **cleansed according to the cosmic ordinance**. May they be **bathed in purity** and **ascend to the Hall of Blessings**, **transferred to the Pure Abode of Refreshment**, and **enter the Celestial Register’s Cavern**.\n\nIn return, we beg that all **our disciples, young and old, and household members** be **granted safety and peace**.\n\nThe **Supreme Dao/Way**’s **mercy is thus invoked**.\n\n**River-Drawing Chapter**\nWith due observance of ritual rank, the petitioner humbly submits:\n\nIn strict accordance with the written records, this undersigned of [state/county/town/village], born in the year [X], month [X], on the day [X], now with my own voice declare:\n\nThough born of flesh and blood, I am but a mortal among the myriad descendants of the Dao. By fortune beyond measure, I have received the blessings of the Great Dao from the beginning. Yet, alas, my faith has often faltered, my conduct strayed—inviting misfortune, suffering hardship, and enduring dreams that are false and visions that are ill-omened.\n\nBy divination and calculation, it is revealed that the River God’s calamity now looms, threatening decline and sickness, peril even unto ruin. I now beseech the Great Dao to intercede with Your ministers on my behalf, submitting this petition to lift the curse of my declining years and the ill-fated month, sparing me from the Three Rivers’ affliction.\n\nAs Your humble servant, I prostrate myself and present this memorial in earnest. I pray that the Three Rivers, the Four Seas, the Nine Rivers’ Water Emperor, and all divine officials may absolve me of my declining years and ill-fated month. Within the Watery Realm, wherever my name is recorded, may they grant me release, lest I be struck and confined to the penal abodes.\n\nFurthermore, I implore the River Marshals of the Four Directions—\n- The **Eastern Azure Emperor’s River Marshal**,\n- The **Southern Vermilion Emperor’s River Marshal**,\n- The **Western White Emperor’s River Marshal**,\n- The **Northern Black Emperor’s River Marshal**,\n- And the **Central Yellow Emperor’s River Marshal**—\neach commanding one hundred twenty attendants to descend and act as my advocates, delivering me from the Three Rivers’ calamity.\n\nI humbly pray that the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**, along with the **Lady of the Azure Decree**, may lift this penal curse, securing my eternal safety. May this be fulfilled as a sign of Your grace.\n\nThe mercy of the **Supreme Dao/Way** is thus invoked.\n\n**Chapter for Safeguarding the Silk Cocoon**\n\nI humbly present my petition with due ritual observance:\n\nAccording to the written records, I now submit my earnest plea, having myself recited the words of supplication. For the accumulated years of failing to harvest the silk cocoons, I fear my offense may be grave. On this auspicious day and favorable hour of the current month, I solemnly invoke:\n\n- The **Eastern Azure Emperor’s Silk Chamber**,\n- The **Southern Vermilion Emperor’s Silk Chamber**,\n- The **Western White Emperor’s Silk Chamber**,\n- The **Northern Black Emperor’s Silk Chamber**,\n- The **Central Yellow Emperor’s Silk Chamber**,\n- The **Ancestors of the Silk Household**,\n- The **Public Matrons of the Silk Household**,\n- The **Descendants of the Silk Household**,\n- The **Celestial Silk Chamber**,\n- The **Netherworld Silk Chamber**,\n- And the **Thirty-Six Silk Chambers**—\n\nto bear witness to my day and night of sorrow and distress, yet ignorant of aid. With single-minded devotion, I rely upon the **Supreme Dao/Way**.\n\nI now solemnly vow by the **Dharma’s sacred authority** and **divine truth of the scriptures** that I, Your humble servant, have submitted this petition to seek divine intercession.\n\nI beseech the **Five Directions’ Silk Chamber deities** to act as substitutes for:\n- Their **public matrons**,\n- Their **household ancestors**,\n- Their **household parents**,\n- Their **household descendants**,\n- And the **four mighty warriors** of left and right, east and west—\n\nto petition the **divine lords**, that they may descend and subdue the **Silk-rearing maids** and **newlywed Silk-rearing brides** of my household. May the black cocoons grow like dragons, the white cocoons like tigers, their movements swift as the wind, their feeding resonant as rain. Let thunderous decrees shake the earth, unconstrained by taboos—only to purge filth and bring destruction to all impurities.\n\nI now solemnly vow by the **Dharma’s sacred authority** and **divine truth of the scriptures**, and further, in the presence of this document, that I invoke the **Five Directions’ Silk-rearing maidens**.\n\nAgain, I invoke the **Five Directions’ Silk-rearing matrons**.\n\nAgain, I invoke the **Silk Lord, Master of Northern Yang**, and the **Silk Lady, Daughter of the Northern Lord**, that they may grant my household this year’s silk cocoons as desired, fostering their growth and flourishing, repelling pestilence and plagues, and causing rodents and insects to perish and vanish entirely.\n\nI humbly pray for a harvest of ten thousand *dan* of cocoons, yielding a thousand *jin* of silk.\n\nKnowing the **Dharma’s sacred authority** as true, and the **divine power of the scriptures** as sacred, I now prostrate myself and submit this petition in earnest, that it may reach the **Three Heavens’ Bureau**.\n\nI humbly pray.\n\nThe **Supreme Dao’s Officials and High Ministers**—may they graciously inspect and oversee.\n\nShould Your mercy be bestowed, I shall devote my singular heart to this cause, as a pledge of sincerity.\n\nThe grace of the **Most High** is profound.\n\nHaving received the **Divine Calculation**, I now present my case in proper order:\n\nIn accordance with the records, I, [name], have today spoken my plea in person. By nature, I am of mortal birth, yet I have long been blessed with auspicious fortune. I have long followed the **Dao**, and Your恩 (favor) has been boundless and profound.\n\nYet, being a common mortal, I know not the celestial cycles of *zhu* and *hou*, nor the stars of *doujian* and *jian*. Now, with the earthly branch at the hour of execution, I fear my lifespan may be cut short by fate’s cruel turn, my natal hour clashing with ill omens. The **Heavenly Net and Earthly Mesh** are drawn tight, and my calculations reveal that all nine calamities will soon encircle me. Day and night, I am wracked with dread, and my true fortune is uncertain—my fate lies in the grave.\n\nWith singular devotion, I now entrust myself to the **Dao**.\n\nI have prepared the **Divine Tokens of Faith** and present them to the **Five Directions’ Spirit Officials**, who shall immediately report to me. I humbly petition for a **Divine Edict** to be submitted to the **Celestial Bureau**, that my life may be redeemed.\n\nThough I am unversed in the **qi and seasons**, I shall comply with their request. I now prostrate myself and submit this petition in earnest, that it may reach the **Celestial Bureau**.\n\nI humbly pray.\n\nThe **Most High Venerable Lord Lao**, all honored **Sages**, the **Three Teachers’ Ladies**, the **Gatekeepers of the Divine Tokens**, all **Supervisory Officials**, and the **Yin-Yang Spirit Officials and Two Scribes of the Five Directions**, showering **Great Mercy’s Grace** and extending **boundless恩 (favor)**, humbly pray for the **Longevity Lords** five, the **Life-Preserving Lords** five, the **Disaster-Dispelling Lords** five, the **Calamity-Scattering Lords** five, the **Age-Sustaining and Misfortune-Transcending Lords** five, and the **Net-Relieving and Heavenly-Redeeming Lords** five—altogether **one hundred and twenty officials**—to convene and descend for me, that they may redeem my life from the **Twenty-Four Prisons of Hell**, the **Celestial Bureau and Earthly Registry**, the **Ancient Shrines and Spirit Altars**, the **Field Deities and Martial Officials**, and the **Departments of Life and Death**.\n\nMay they investigate my body for all **crimes recorded**, my name inscribed in the **Black Ledger of Doom**, and plead for its alteration: that my **misfortunes be averted**, my **illnesses cured**, the **withered restored**, the **dead revived**, the **frail granted endurance**, and the **afflicted spared**.\n\nThough my **years are few** and my **allotted lifespan brief**, I earnestly pray that the **Dao’s Boundless Mercy** establish the **Way of Resurrection**.\n\nWe, the petitioners, **affirm our solemn vows**, and submit this **Divine Edict** to the **Three Celestial Bureaus**, beseeching them to redeem my life, extend my years and enhance my vitality, **erase my death and elevate me to life**.\n\nNow that this **petition has been presented**, may all my household—great and small—**suffer no further calamities or misfortunes**, forever enjoying **peace and well-being**, my dwelling **pure and tranquil**, my ancestral tomb **secure and serene**.\n\nMay the **Nine Ancestors** arrive, **wandering freely at ease**, and all beings in **unity of heart**—thus proving my **sincere faith**.\n\n**With deepest gratitude**, I acknowledge the **Most High’s** discernment as spoken above.\n\n「With deepest reverence, I submit a **Divine Edict for Petitioning the Star of Atonement** to extend my lifespan and enhance my vitality.\n\nNow, I present a **Divine Edict for the Nine Ancestors’ Litigation**, in accordance with proper rites and ranks, to the **Supreme Daoist Lord of Such-and-Such Palace** for adjudication.\n\nThe petitioner, **a certain individual of [state] Province, [county] County, [village] Village**, humbly submits this **Divine Edict**, stating that my lineage has been afflicted by calamities and decline, my household burdened by illness, my actions unfavorable, and my dwelling unstable. I seek to **dissolve and exorcise the ancestral litigation** plaguing my family.\n\nUpon reviewing their grievances, I find cause for concern: my **Seven Ancestors and Nine Generations**, both living and deceased, have committed many transgressions. The departed have already been **condemned by the Celestial Tribunals**, and my descendants have not yet been granted **redemption**. In the **netherworld’s obscurity**, they now **lament in sorrow**, suffering such litigations as:\n- **Burial in water sources**,\n- **Funeral rites obstructed by deities**,\n- **Tombs pierced by burrowing**,\n- **Coffins damaged by malevolent forces**,\n- **Old tombs overlapping with new**,\n- **New tombs encroaching upon the dead**,\nAs years and months pass, my descendants **remain unaware**, or endure **drowning by water, burning by fire**, **corruption by insects, or poison from medicines**. Even **uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters**, or **aunts, cousins, and sisters**, may **successionally afflict** one another, bringing **misfortune and woe**.\n\nIf even one of these persists, they shall be **severely punished**—**Deng Palace’s records of guilt** will be invoked—and though they may **willingly confess**, the **Mystic Laws** will still **extend their mercy** to allow for **atonement**.\n\nThus, I humbly follow the **Thousand and Two Hundred Official Rituals**, as well as the **Orthodox One True Master’s** and the **Three Celestial Daoist Priests’** teachings on the **Method of the Southern Peak Purple Void Primordial Lord** to **quell diseases and banish malevolence**. I earnestly beseech the **Heavenly Champion Lord** to dispatch **Ten Million Yellow-Clad Soldiers** to **capture and annihilate** the **One Hundred Twenty Calamities** and **Strong (凶) Beasts** within my household, as well as the **Twelve Criminal Ghosts**, all of which I command to be **utterly destroyed**.\n\nFurther, I implore the **Supreme High Warehouse Lord**, with **One Million Soldiers**, to **restrain and subdue** the **Five Tomb Ghosts** who, through **wandering and lingering**, haunt my descendants, causing **calamities, misfortunes, illnesses, and endless injuries** to me. I decree their **total annihilation**.\n\nAdditionally, I call upon the **Lord of Qi and Disaster Resolution**, with **One Million Soldiers**, to **dispel and dissolve** the **inverted influences** within my household and the **Twelve Criminal Ghosts** afflicting me, along with the **One Hundred Twenty Calamities and Tribunals**, so that they may **cease their malevolent schemes** and **ward off the Six Celestial Qi’s** encroachment.\n\nI also summon the **Great General of Beneficent Heaven**, with **One Million Soldiers**, the **Five Lords of Ten Thousand Blessings**, and **One Hundred Twenty Official Commanders**, as well as the **Lord of Stone Tranquility**, with **One Hundred Twenty Official Commanders**, and the **Lord of Northern Peace**, with **One Hundred Twenty Official Commanders**, to **ward off and expel** the lingering **malevolent forces** in the **Mystic Origin Palace**. They must **capture and punish** all **ghostly bandits** who, through **spirits and specters**, obstruct my family—**great and small**—and ensure their **immediate decimation**, so that I may **transcend death and embrace life**, and **turn misfortune into blessing**.\n\nMoreover, I request the **Single Lord of Stone Immortality**, with **One Hundred Twenty Official Commanders**, to **ward off and annihilate** the **Strong (凶) Beasts** within my household, **suppressing all specters** and preventing further harm.\n\nI also invoke the **Five Lords of the Four Aspects**, with **One Hundred Twenty Official Commanders each**, to **dispel and dissolve** the **malevolent forces and specters** within my household, which **disturb and harass** my dwelling, causing **instability and unrest**. They must **capture and sever**, **distinguishing pure from impure**, and **resolve all litigations and tribulations**.\n\nFurthermore, I petition the **Lord of the Red Heaven Who Devours Qi**, with **One Hundred Twenty Official Commanders**, to **drive away and suppress** the **litigations of distant and near kin**, as well as those of **outsiders**, and to **apprehend all malevolent, vengeful, and slanderous spirits** who **persistently harass**, refusing to retreat. All such **spectral harm** must be **severed and utterly destroyed**.\n\nAgain, I summon the **Lord of the Supreme Divine Clarity**, with **One Hundred Twenty Official Commanders**, to **resolve and dispel** the **evil dreams and disorientations** plaguing me, where my **soul does not remain steadfast** and my **spirit wanders unrestrained**. May I **attain peace and clarity**, and have my **deep-rooted afflictions** **cease and disperse**.\n\nI also beseech the **Lord of the Great Mystic**, with **One Hundred Twenty Official Commanders**, to **rectify the Mystic Origin Palace**, where **malevolent influences** within my household **disrupt the spirit**, cause **illness and affliction**, and induce **fright, confusion, and disorientation**, leaving me **unaware of my surroundings**. May these **malevolent forces** be **destroyed and their harm annulled**, so that my household may **forever be free from calamity**.\n\nAdditionally, I invoke the **Five Lords of Earth’s Control**, with **One Hundred Twenty Official Commanders each**, to **subdue the Netherworld’s Palace**. They must **dispel and dissolve** the **yearly, monthly, and daily influences of the Celestial Lifespan, the Soil King, and the Tomb Star**, as well as all **encroachments and offenses** against them, so that the **high and low, elder and younger ghosts** may **no longer cause harm**. All must be **utterly annihilated**.\n\nI also call upon the **Supreme Lord of Heaven’s Birth**, with **One Million Soldiers**, and the **Supreme Lord of the Auspicious Aspect**, with **One Million Soldiers**, to **capture and resolve** the **sequential deaths** within my household, where **malevolent influences** persistently **harass and afflict**. I decree their **total destruction**.\n\nLastly, I implore the **General of Auspicious Protection** and his **officers and soldiers**, bearing the **Supreme Mystic True Talisman** and **carrying the Netherworld’s Green Edict**, along with the **Earthly Officials of the Second Rank** and the **Twenty-Four Prisons of Mount Tai**, to **capture and dispel** the **ghosts of ancestral litigation** within my tombs. They must **inform the Netherworld’s officials**, the **Mound Wardens, Tomb Marshals, Lord of the Blue Forest, Lord of the Martial Abyss**, the **Left and Right Tomb Lords**, the **Netherworld’s Official of the Tomb Excavation**, the **Right Rite Officer of the Reeds**, the **elders of the locality**, and all **regional authorities**, commanding them to **sever and cut off** all **ancestral malevolence and reafflicted influences**, and to **utterly destroy** them all.\n\nIf my ancestors have already **arrived in the Netherworld**, whether they **died before or after** me, and whether they be **male or female, elder or younger**, and wherever they are **buried**, should they **encroach upon the Twelve Monthly Stars, the Celestial Lifespan, the Eight Generals, the Six Oppositions, or any tabooed or forbidden influences**, causing **unfavorable sounds, improper burial rites, or obstruction of the living’s seats**, leading to **ancestral malevolence, illness in descendants, and perpetual unrest**, then I command all such **offenses** to be **explained and reconciled**, **restored according to their origins**, and **transformed from malevolence to benevolence**, from **misfortune to blessing**. Thus, **life and death, the living and the dead**, shall **no longer be entangled or influenced**.」\n\nI humbly petition the **Du Star Lord**, with one hundred twenty officials and soldiers, to govern the **Hua Gai Palace**; the **Zhuo Yang Lord**, with one hundred twenty officials and soldiers, to govern the **Cang Ming Palace**; and the **Tai Bai Zhong Zhen Ming Lord**, with one hundred twenty officials and soldiers, to **resolve the celestial connections** for my family’s seven generations henceforth—those who died before or after me, male or female, elder or younger—**dispelling the Twelve Hourly calamities, lingering malevolence, and untimely deaths**, ensuring all **death and suffering are extinguished** and **retaliatory qi is severed**.\n\nShould any **residual malevolent qi** falsely assume form or shadow, **summon ghostly armies**, coerce the deceased, **injure those bound by burial taboos**, or **haunt my household**, **seizing souls and causing illness**, let them be **arrested under ghostly law** and **annihilated**.\n\nFurthermore, I petition the **Supreme Celestial Lord of Heavenly Mystery**, with twelve thousand soldiers, to **subdue all slanderous, defamatory, and cursing qi**—whether from nobles or commoners, high or low, male or female—**forcing them into concealment**, preventing any harm.\n\nI also petition the **Chi Sha Lord**, with one hundred twenty officials and soldiers, to govern the **Nan Chang Palace**, and **collect the Five Worms and Six Spirits**, the one hundred twenty calamities, and **wasteful ghosts** that **plague my home**, causing **loss and misfortune**. Let all such **malevolence be eradicated**.\n\nAll twenty-four petitioned lords, officials, soldiers, and clerks shall **immediately assemble below**, each performing their duties: **dissolving ancestral curses, dispelling calamities, reconciling disputes, severing retaliatory qi**, and **silencing the restless**—whether deceased ancestors, relatives, or those who died violently, were exiled, or perished without heirs—**including the eighty-one prior grievances and myriad ancestral retributions**, all **suppressed and rendered powerless**, unable to act. Should any persist in **fomenting resentment, lurking for opportunity, or exploiting weakness to incite harm**, let them be **arrested, suppressed, and utterly annihilated**, with no further influence over me.\n\nMay my **living and deceased** now exist in **separate realms**, with **fortune and misfortune distinct**. From this day forward, may my **vital essence flow harmoniously**, **celestial blessings guard me**, my **five zang and six fu regulate**, my **true essence replenish internally**, all **illnesses vanish**, my **endeavors prosper**, and **merit grow daily**, while **auspiciousness descends** and **malevolence disperses**, benefiting both **public and private spheres**. May all—living and dead—**rely upon this grace**.\n\nThe petitioned **celestial officials, soldiers, and clerks**, both civil and martial, shall **record their diligence**, **expel ghostly harm**, and **achieve merit in suppression**. I humbly request **promotion and rewards** in accordance with their ranks, as per the **Heavenly Tribunal’s standard procedures**, lest they harbor resentment.\n\nI offer **forty bolts of purple-patterned silk**, twelve dou of rice, one thousand two hundred coins, a set of **ceremonial robes**, one hundred twenty sheets of petition paper, two catties of ink, two writing brushes, one liang of cinnabar, a writing knife, one mat, and one towel—**to recompense their labor**.\n\nWith deepest gratitude to the **Supreme Sage**.\n\nI, **[Name]**, suffering illness, **petition to resolve the ancestral retributions** of my deceased, **presenting a Great Tomb Litigation Tablet** to the heavens.\n\nAdditionally, the **Great Tomb Litigation Tablet**, originating from the **Seven Immortals of Mao Shan**, states:\n\n**Master Xu the Historian** said: *\"To ascend, one must first resolve the grievances of the three past lives. The Western Spirit Lady instructed me to seek a Daoist official to petition this Tomb Litigation Tablet, thereby purifying ancestral debts.\"*\n\nThe tablet contains **ritual stipulations**. If petitioning tomorrow, tonight **prepare five bathing chambers**, as one would for purification, with **full devotion**, and **three sets of small garments**, along with silver and coins, **offered to the deceased for cleansing**.\n\nAfter completing the petition tomorrow, **burn the tablet**. Alongside it, **burn the garments and coins**, ensuring all are **pure and complete**.\n\nIt is further said: *\"If a family’s affairs decline, their lineage falters, and they suffer prolonged illness, misfortune, and stagnation—with descendants suffering—it is due to ancestral litigation and restless spirits **afflicting the living**. Petitioning this tablet **three times within a year** shall bring great benefit.\"*\n\nAdjust the wording as needed, **keeping it concise and proper**, without redundancy.\n\n**Ritual Position Established:**\nI, **[Name]**, an official of **[Title]**, aged **[Age]**, born on the **[Day]** of **[Month]**, of **[Province]-[County]-[Village]**, with **[Name]** as household head, **now kneel and prostrate**, humbly stating:\n\nBy **birth and fortune**, I have **received the Dao’s blessings**, nurtured by its grace, and attained this life. Yet, I have **transgressed or sought improperly**—whether in **pursuing office, enduring illness, or seeking atonement**—all **recorded in this petition**.\n\nMy **deeds have strayed from virtue**, my **actions defied reason**, and though I **strive to amend**, my **merit is insufficient**. This has **invoked ancestral retribution** and **brought misfortune upon the living**, causing **ominous dreams, repeated setbacks, and lingering afflictions**. I fear **ancestral litigation persists**, with the deceased **petitioning me for resolution**.\n\nI, **[Name]**, having investigated: **Human life draws from yin and yang’s pure qi**, received from parents, with **bloodline ties extending seven generations**, and **collateral relations to uncles and brothers**. **Virtue and vice are shared**, and **prosperity or decline follow in kind**. The **celestial bureaucracy’s rewards and punishments** extend only so far; the **Netherworld’s judgments** should not **exceed these bounds**.\n\nThe bonds of service having grown distant, the afflictions naturally abate.\nMoreover, each has their own descendants, not mingling indiscriminately.\nI, considering the restless spirits of the deceased—\nwhen they move, they interact with material forms—\nthe records confirm this, and such cases are numerous.\n\nYet, the fleshly eyes are obscured and cannot perceive,\nwhile shamans and mediums, though they glimpse them,\nhave not thoroughly investigated.\nThis is because, once form and sound separate,\ntheir echoes and shadows fail to converge,\nand their luminous apparitions still resemble the living.\n\nHowever, their emotions and attachments differ—\nnot necessarily bound by the past—\nthus giving rise to many grievances and resentments,\nwhich swiftly become calamities and blame.\n\nNow, if we fail to ferry them across the suffering’s threshold,\nto sever this path of resentment,\nthen the harm will deepen, and the retribution will only intensify.\nThus, the scriptures urge with earnestness:\nto prioritize their transcendence as the foundation;\nto guide them with gentle persuasion,\nensuring their liberation comes first.\n\nYet in their lifetimes, all were guilty of more wrongs than blessings.\nWith offenses so numerous, they endured prolonged suffering;\nwith merit so scarce, they had no grounds for redemption.\nThis is the entanglement of accumulated karma,\na calamity that knows no end.\n\nNow, I fear that the deceased relatives of **[Name’s] family**—\ntheir names and forms, their natural fates in the Netherworld—\nare not entirely unrestrained.\nSome may be detained under punishment,\nthus provoking litigation and appeals.\n\nMoreover, spanning seven generations is a vast expanse—\nlater descendants are beyond reckoning.\nTheir virtues and vices cannot be fully discerned.\nSince we cannot now ascertain their deeds,\nI solemnly present this before the assembled witnesses,\nlaying out the full account.\n\nI fear that **[Name’s] family**, from the seventh ancestor onward—\npast and present—\nmay now, within the Three Officials and Nine Departments of the Netherworld,\nface litigation for drowning deaths,\nfor burning deaths,\nfor wound deaths,\nfor strangulation deaths,\nfor imprisonment deaths,\nfor suffocation deaths,\nfor falls and crushings,\nfor trampling deaths,\nfor beatings and blows,\nfor poison deaths,\nfor venomous insect deaths,\nfor deaths in childbirth or lactation,\nfor starvation deaths,\nfor deaths by cold or frost,\nfor deaths by heat or thirst,\nfor deaths by demonic torment,\nfor deaths by plague or epidemic,\nfor deaths by sudden illness,\nfor deaths by cholera,\nfor deaths by abscesses or ulcers,\nfor deaths by edema, tumors, or stroke,\nfor deaths by a thousand maladies and a hundred diseases—\neach with their own grievances.\n\nAnd further, there may be litigation for deaths in old age,\nfor deaths in youth,\nfor deaths in solitude,\nfor deaths alone,\nfor deaths as widowed men,\nfor deaths as widowed women,\nfor deaths as strangers,\nfor deaths in borrowed homes,\nfor deaths unclothed,\nfor deaths exposed to the elements,\nfor deaths without coffins,\nfor deaths with coffins but no outer cases,\nfor coffins and cases rotted or broken,\nfor unburied corpses,\nfor scattered bones,\nfor bones gnawed by birds and beasts,\nfor bones burned,\nfor bones waterlogged,\nfor bones crushed by carts or horses,\nfor bones dug up in filth,\nfor improper burials,\nfor unburied remains,\nfor burials not in ancestral graves,\nfor burials violating taboos,\nfor unstable burials,\nfor burials misaligned in height or cardinal direction—\nwhere ancestors, parents, spouses, concubines, nieces, nephews, grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, and cousins\nmay all bring mutual litigation.\n\nThere may be litigation for failing to raise one’s children,\nfor abandoning children to slavery,\nfor disputes over same-surname kin,\nfor disputes over different-surname kin,\nfor having no home,\nfor having no descendants,\nfor grievances of resentment,\nfor grievances of blame,\nfor grievances of sorrow,\nfor sudden, unexplained deaths.\n\nAnd further, in life, there may be litigation for favoritism,\nfor grudges,\nfor disputes,\nfor unjust killings,\nfor false accusations—\nand after death, for disputes over posthumous titles,\nfor breaches of oaths,\nfor curses,\nfor punishments,\nfor imprisonment,\nfor exile,\nfor the twenty-four prison torments,\nfor entanglement in malevolent karma.\n\nThen there are petitions for pardons,\nfor return to one’s family,\nfor substitution by another,\nfor restoration of lost items.\n\nEach of these litigations has its own particulars:\nFor drowning deaths, they allege being submerged in the watery realm, their forms drenched.\nFor burning deaths, they allege their hair and skin scorched, their flesh peeled away.\nFor wound deaths, they allege their bodies mutilated, their wounds weeping blood.\nFor strangulation deaths, they allege their throats bound tight, their breath cut off.\nFor imprisonment deaths, they allege their chains and shackles unyielding, their freedom denied.\nFor suffocation deaths, they allege their chests compressed, their breath stifled.\nFor forced labor deaths, they allege their irons heavy upon them, their punishments cruel.\nFor deaths by crushing, they allege their limbs bent and broken, unable to straighten.\nFor battlefield deaths, they allege their heads severed from their bodies.\nFor falls, they allege their bones shattered.\nFor trampling deaths, they allege their veins knotted and bruised.\nFor beatings, they allege their heads split, their arms fractured.\nFor poison deaths, they allege their intestines ruptured.\nFor deaths by wild beasts, they allege their flesh devoured.\nFor venomous insect deaths, they allege their skin swollen and rotting.\nFor deaths in childbirth or lactation, they allege their bellies torn, their blood foul.\nFor starvation deaths, they allege their stomachs empty and exhausted.\nFor deaths by cold, they allege their bodies trembling in rigor, their limbs stiff.\nFor deaths by heat, they allege their throats parched, their breath ragged.\nFor deaths by demonic torment, they allege their spirits in terror, subdued by malevolent forces.\nFor plague deaths, they allege their bodies racked by fever and chill.\nFor deaths by sudden illness, they allege their pain abrupt and unbearable, their suffering unrelieved.\nFor cholera deaths, they allege their diets excessive, their vital forces disordered.\nFor abscess deaths, they allege their skin suppurating, their organs ruptured.\nFor deaths by edema, tumors, stroke, or wind disorders, they allege their bodies weighed down and tormented.\n\nFor deaths in old age, they allege their bones weary and spent.\nFor deaths in youth, they allege their lives cut short before fulfillment.\nFor deaths in solitude, they allege their childhood without parents.\nFor deaths alone, they allege their old age without heirs.\nFor deaths as widowed men, they allege their lack of wives.\nFor deaths as widowed women, they allege their lack of husbands.\nFor deaths as strangers, they allege their burial far from home.\nFor deaths in borrowed homes, they allege their burial not in their own land.\nFor deaths unclothed, they allege their nakedness.\nFor deaths exposed, they allege their lack of covering.\nFor deaths without coffins, they allege their bodies pressed into the earth.\nFor deaths without outer cases, they allege their decay exposed.\nFor rotted coffins, they allege their bodies unshielded.\nFor unburied corpses, they allege their need for interment.\nFor scattered bones, they allege their need for reunion.\nFor bones gnawed by birds and beasts, they allege their lost flesh.\nFor burned bones, they allege their need for restoration.\nFor waterlogged bones, they allege their need for elevation and drying.\nFor bones crushed by carts or horses, they allege their need for relocation.\nFor bones dug up in filth, they allege their need for cleansing and removal.\nFor improper burials, they allege their need for correction.\nFor unburied remains, they allege their need for proper burial mounds.\n\nBurials in foreign graves, they allege the wrong earthly domain.\n\nViolations of taboos, they allege offending the sacred positions of the spirits.\n\nUnstable burials, they allege the disturbance of earthly *qi*.\n\nDisputes over high and low or four-directional graves, each alleges their proper placement, yet demands further relocation.\n\nDisputes among the six relatives and nine clans, each alleges their living kin betrayed the bonds of kinship and virtue.\n\nCases of nurturing children yet failing to raise them, they allege that Heaven’s nature permits endurance of suffering, yet they cannot fully mature.\n\nDisputes with same-surname kin, they allege the absence of compassionate rites.\n\nDisputes with different-surname kin, they allege mutual scorn and reckless transgression.\n\nCases of the homeless dead, they allege no proper resting place.\n\nCases of those without descendants, they allege the extinction of ancestral sacrifices.\n\nDisputes from resentment, they allege their *zhìqi* not being fulfilled.\n\nDisputes from blame and anger, they allege others encroaching upon them.\n\nDisputes from grief, they allege excessive misfortune and wrongs.\n\nDisputes from sudden death, they allege no chance to speak.\n\nAgain, during life, any grudges or feuds with others, each has its own disputes, all arising from lingering resentments—none can be traced or recalled—yet they summon the deceased’s descendants, and all disputes stem from the inability to endure suffering, demanding retribution from the living.\n\nThough broadly encompassing the eighty-one disputes, their branches and leaves scatter, multiplying into myriad cases.\n\nThere are also those who, in life, committed offenses and, in death, suffer punishments—boiled in hot water, scorched by fire, cut by windblades, dissolved by lightning, burdened with stones, crushed in mountains, dredging rivers, blocking seas—such calamities, numbering countless thousands, all drag their descendants into litigation, passing blame through generations.\n\nFurther, there are hidden grudges and concealed resentments, festering sores and suppressed hatreds, which erupt in thoughts and words, spawning disputes both seen and unseen.\n\nSome, in times when justice is not upheld, face dire straits, unable to bear their sorrow, their hearts heavy with grief and tongues bitter with curses. They utter harsh complaints, invoke Heaven and Earth, defame the luminous and sacred, revile the gods and spirits, and their grievances reach the Underworld, all becoming grounds for litigation.\n\nOr those who, in life, committed heinous crimes, built no virtuous deeds, and violated all laws and prohibitions—all such cases are entered into the records of judgment.\n\nA hundred years, fifty years, thirty years, twenty years, ten years, one year, one month, one day, one hour—accumulated punishments add up, and all these judgments combine. After death, the remaining punishments do not cease; they cling and accumulate, endlessly across generations.\n\nThe tormented soul, restless and anguished, grows ever harder to bear, unable to endure suffering. They implore the ghostly officials to summon their living kin, demanding they face their agonies instead.\n\nThough the Underworld’s judgments are clear, there are still those who twist and pervert justice. Some can hear the ghosts’ pleas and issue summons, causing a family to suffer endless illnesses and calamities year after year, strange omens in dreams, dwindling wealth, with no way to avert disaster.\n\nThe petitioner humbly begs the celestial master of the dark realm to review the edicts and records, and only the urgent matter of resolving grave disputes and burial records should be addressed. The petitioner, though distant from the sacred and revered, and though the paths may have strayed and been lost, seeks to clarify the source of their suffering with utmost sincerity. They follow the rites of the thousand-two-hundred officials, and the true methods taught by the One True Person to the Southern Peak Wei Lady for healing and pacifying spirits, to request on behalf of the family:\n\n- That the Heavenly Official Lord dispatch five officers, each with a hundred and twenty soldiers,\n- And that the Left and Right Marshals of the Underworld be summoned, each with a hundred and twenty soldiers, to oversee the Great Bright Palace.\n\nThe petitioner further requests the Generals of Protection and their soldiers, along with the Heavenly Official’s true talismans, to seize and disperse all the ghosts tied to grave disputes and burial records, as well as those causing hidden harm. They shall then issue a proclamation to the family, using their original names and surnames, to:\n\n- Confront the god of grave disputes and burial records under the jurisdiction of the Gōngmáng (勾芒) deity,\n- Summon the god of grave disputes and burial records under the jurisdiction of the Zhūróng (祝融) deity,\n- Invoke the god of grave disputes and burial records under the jurisdiction of the Bóshōu (薄收) deity,\n- Call upon the god of grave disputes and burial records under the jurisdiction of the Xuánmíng (玄冥) deity,\n- And appeal to the god of grave disputes and burial records under the jurisdiction of the Gōuchén (勾陈) deity.\n\n「When the matters of the **Chóuzhèng** (丘丞) and **Mùbó** (墓伯), the **Dìxià èr qiānshí** (地下二千石), the **Cānglín** (苍林) and **Wǔyí** (武夷) deities, the **zuǒyòu zhǒnghòu** (左右冢侯), and the **Dìzhōng jīmù qīng** (地中司激墓卿右秩) along with the **Háolǐ** (蒿里) elders—all the deities and spirits governing these regions—are addressed, they shall sternly sever and cut off the **qi** (气) of grave disputes and the **ghosts** (鬼) tied to the burial sites of the **certain family** (某家), and resolve those that cause hidden harm.\n\nShould the **certain family** (某家) have, from their ancestors and great-grandparents onward, any graves or burial sites that violate the **Twelve Monthly Prohibitions** (十二月建破), the **Eight Generals and Six Opposing Forces** (八将六对), or other **taboos** (禁忌), or which suffer from **improper orientation** (音向不正), **unfit burial order** (哺次不得), **misaligned graves** (左前右后), **corpses left uncovered** (伏尸), or **wrongful deaths** (刑祸) leading to endless **wastage** (虚耗), and which obstruct the prosperity of their descendants, then these offenses shall be **clarified** (解释) and **restored** (和合补复), ensuring that all shall attain **peace in life and death** (生死咸安).\n\nThereupon, the **Dàxiāo** (大玄) **Way** (君) is summoned, along with **120 officials and soldiers** (官将), to govern the **Wúqú** (无渠) **Office** (官).\n\nFurthermore, the **Jiǔdì** (九地) **Way** (君) is summoned, with **120 officials and soldiers** (官将), to govern the **Màolǐ** (茂理) **Office** (宫).

The petitioner **speaks as he wills** (任随本意言之), yet **adjusts according to circumstances** (在临时改张).\n\nThis **supplication for the Heavenly Officials to dissolve the deceased’s tomb and settle posthumous trials, curses, and calamities, ensuring peace for the dead and benefit for the living, and extinguishing all misfortunes** (天官分解亡人冢墓考讼殃祟安死利生制灭祸害乞恩章) is now **offered to the Supreme Dao/Way of [specific deity’s] Court** (太上某宫曹治).\n\nThe petitioner **humbly awaits your response** (伏须告报), **truly fearful and trembling** (臣某诚惶诚恐), **prostrates and bows twice in reverence** (稽首再拜以闻).\n\n**End of Volume Five of the *赤松子章* (赤松子章历)**\n**End of Volume Six of the *赤松子章* (赤松子章历)**\n**Supplication for Bathing the Deceased** (沐浴章)\n\nThe petitioner, **having carefully reviewed the written records and right decrees** (谨按文书右牒), **today prostrates in supplication** (即日稽首), **looking upward to consider** that the deceased, in life, **accumulated many sins and transgressions** (多诸罪累), and after death, **was imprisoned within the Three Heavenly Departments** (没命之后，囚闭三官), **suffering hardship without reprieve** (困苦之中). Yet even then, **no deliverance was granted** (未蒙解脱).\n\nNow, the petitioner **humbly relies upon the power of the Great Dao/Way** (谨凭 大道之力) to **rescue and save the wandering soul from past karmic debts and transgressions** (拯济幽魂宿业愆尤), **cleansing them thoroughly today** (以今荡涤).\n\nThe petitioner **brings forth the deceased’s garments from life** (谨赍亡人在生衣物), as well as **auspicious coins, rice, incense, oil, colored brushes, ink, and other ritual offerings** (镇信钱米香油方彩笔墨等), and **erects a bathing pavilion in the purified courtyard** (谨於净庭立作浴堂). All bathing implements are **made clean and pure** (沐浴之具，皆令清净), so that the deceased **may be freed from the netherworld** (免离幽涂).\n\nThe petitioner **now humbly prostrates on the ground, offering this petition** (伏地拜章), **to request the Heavenly Officials to bathe the Lord of the Deceased** (沐浴君吏), **the Lady of the Deceased** (沐浴夫人), and **the Thousand Two Hundred Immortal Jade Maidens** (洗浣玉女千二百人), **that they may inspect the deceased’s spirit-form** (鉴临亡人), **bathe their essence, cleanse their impurities, remove their shackles, and allow them to behold the radiant light** (沐浴身形，洗垢除秽，去离桎桔), **wandering freely and joyously** (得睹光明，逍遥快乐), **with sustenance and clothing provided naturally** (衣食自然), **never lacking in any way** (无诸乏少), **ensuring their tombs rest in peace** (安稳冢墓), and **protecting the living descendants** (佑利生人), **as proof of their efficacy** (以为效信).\n\n**The supplication is made to the Supreme Dao/Way of the Many True Ones** (恩惟太上众真分别), **begging for mercy** (求哀).\n\nThe petitioner **now humbly offers this petition for the Heavenly Bathing of the Deceased in crimson script** (臣某谨为拜上天官沐浴朱章一通), **to be presented to the Supreme Dao/Way of [specific deity’s] Court** (上诣 太上某宫曹治).\n\n**Thus it is written.** (云云)\n\n**Petition for Redemption from Exile**\n\nWith due reverence, the petitioner submits this **Exile-Redemption Chapter**, presenting the proper rites and ranks, and humbly states:\n\nIn accordance with the written decree, the petitioner now prostrates in awe, fearing that the deceased, during their lifetime, often transgressed and incurred misfortunes, thus meeting an untimely end. Such suffering is beyond the comprehension of both mortals and deities. Their sins accumulated before the **Mysterious Tribunals**, their offenses exposed to the **Celestial Registry**, for in life, their **Three Actions** and **Six Senses** were bound by countless transgressions—**offending Heaven’s prohibitions**, **defying Earth’s taboos**, and **provoking resentment from both humans and spirits**. Their guilt was profound, their fate uncertain in the afterlife. Thus, with a single resolve, they turned to the **Great Dao**, entrusted their plea to this undersigned, and sought this petition, as detailed below.\n\nThe petitioner now humbly prostrates and presents this supplication:\n\nTo the **General of the White Chariot and White Horse**, with **ten thousand soldiers**, and to the **Lord of the Great Mysteries**, with **one hundred twenty officials**, to descend together and act as **guardians of the deceased’s spirit**, ensuring their eternal liberation from the **Three Realms of Suffering**, their names inscribed in the **Six Celestial Registers**, and their deliverance from grave offenses.\n\nFurther, the petitioner requests the **True Seal of the Great Mysteries**, to be conveyed to the **Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Tribunals**, along with the **Green Imperial Edict**, addressed to:\n- The **Earthly Officials of Rank Two Thousand**,\n- The **Mound Governors and Tomb Marshals**,\n- The **Twelve Grave Deities**,\n- The **Twenty-Four Prisons of Mount Tai**,\n- The **Eastern Peak (Tai Shan) Underworld Prison**,\n- The **Central Capital Grand Prison**,\n- The **Northern Heavenly Prison of the First Celestial**,\n- The **Southern Peak (Heng Shan) Underworld Prison**,\n- The **Western Peak (Hua Shan) Underworld Prison**,\n- The **Northern Peak (Heng Shan) Underworld Prison**,\n- The **Central Peak (Song Shan) Underworld Prison**,\n- The **Northern Capital Frozen Pool Prison**,\n- The **Nine Rivers’ Water Emperor and River Marshal’s subordinates and clerks**—\n\nThat all may **release the deceased from torment**, ensuring their ascent to the **Hall of Blessings**, with **sustenance and clothing provided naturally**, and that they **shall not be summoned to dispute with the living**.\n\nMay the **Supreme Dao/Way** grant mercy and **extend this grace to one and all**.\n\n**Memorial on Behalf of a Grave Illness and Great Calamity**\n*(Gold-Purple Substitute Form Tablet)*\n\n**The Petitioner humbly states:**\nIn strict accordance with the official documents and titles, a certain individual, born in the year [X], month [Y], day [Z], having reached the age of [W], now residing in [State]-[County]-[Village]-[Precinct], respectfully submits this Gold-Purple Substitute Form Tablet.\n\nFrom childhood to this day, this petitioner has been without virtue or merit, yet has been graced with heavy honors and emoluments. As years have passed, his offenses have grown deeper. Though his duty lies in nurturing the people and his governance in soothing the customs, he has at times been swayed by private affections, favoring the near over the public, or recklessly meted out punishments, incurring the wrath of the True Sage. Even minor transgressions have led to grave consequences, and he has long feared the retribution of the Underworld, yet remained unaware.\n\nSince [month], this petitioner has suffered calamities and illnesses beyond measure. He humbly trusts that the **Supreme Dao/Way** secretly grants reprieve—where there is sincerity, there is response—and thus dares to lay bare his plea, awaiting Your merciful inspection.\n\nIn strict observance of the rites, this petitioner presents:\n- A golden effigy (*jinren*) of his form,\n- Purple silk (*zǐwén*) of [X] *zhang*,\n- Rice: one *shi* two *dou* (by age),\n- *Zhen* coins: one thousand two hundred,\n- Oil: one *dou* two *sheng*,\n- Paper: one hundred twenty sheets,\n- Brushes: two,\n- Ink: two *qīng* (ink sticks),\n- Green silk thread: one hundred twenty *zhang*,\n- *Suànzi* (divination rods): one hundred twenty,\n- A clean cloth: one,\nas **verifiable tokens** to be offered to the **Supreme Dao/Way**, beseeching the granting of this memorial, the erasure of his name from the dead registry, and his inscription into the living ledger.\n\nThis petitioner, in accordance with the Master’s teachings and examining the celestial charts, notes that his birth was recorded in the Nine Heavens, adorned with the Five Constant Virtues (*wǔcháng*). His fate is ensnared within the Nine Palaces, entangled by the Eight Trigrams, illuminated by the Three Luminaries, and sustained by the Seven Celestial Deities. Under the canopy of Heaven and Earth, the Five *Qi* nurture his form, while Yin and Yang foster his life. His destiny is as vast as the cosmos, mirroring the laws of Heaven and Earth, inscribed in the **Central Register of the Middle Element**, overseen by the **Lord of Fate** and the **Master of Records**. The **Great Unity** verifies his years, the **Mysterious Symbols** are inscribed, and his name resides within the **Southern Palace of Nanchang**, the **Purple Orchid Chamber**, enshrined in the **Jade Ledger of Seven Treasures**. He has aligned with Heaven and Earth, drawn the breath of the Mysterious Celestial, and his fate was sealed in the Underworld—yet originally, there was no premature death. Now, however, his worldly fortune has waned: the Three Elements converge in mourning, his true *qi* ascends, and the Six Heavens resound with drumbeats. A thousand malevolent spirits and ten thousand demons harm the living, leaving justice unexalted and wrongs unredressed. The **Three Corpses** and wandering souls soar through the heavens, while vengeful ghosts wail, accusing the Three Officials. Though Heaven is high and the Underworld distant, their pleas are unheeded, and their suffering extends to the living. Even his ancestors, both internal and external, have been harmed, their essences disrupted, leading to calamity.\n\nThis petitioner, referencing the **Nine Methods of the Celestial Master** and the *Yuanchen Bao Gou Command Decisions*, knows that human life, whether born under auspicious or inauspicious stars, has a predetermined span—whether long or short, marked by years, months, days, and hours. If one is born under auspicious virtue, they shall long enjoy the Five Blessings; if they encounter punishments or harm, they shall meet the Six Extremities.\n\nUpon investigation, this petitioner’s native star is **[X]**, his given name **[Y]**, and as a ghost, he has endured [Z] years of calamity and suffering.\n\nIt is heard that the **Supreme Dao/Way** is universally compassionate, favoring life and abhorring death, rescuing from all disasters and dissolving all calamities. Those born must live, and those who have perished must be restored. Out of pity for his family and mercy for his suffering, this petitioner, though unworthy of his official duties and charged with proclaiming benevolent governance, dares to lay bare this humble plea before the **Supreme Without-Extremity Dao/Way**, the **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao**, the **Honored Lords and Masters**, the **Celestial Master and Female Teacher**, and the **Three Teachers and All Revered Ones**, beseeching them to extend great mercy, grant a special pardon, and absolve this petitioner of his past transgressions and myriad sins. May the **Dao/Way’s vital breath** envelop him, restoring the nurturing grace of life, saving all beings, and granting him prolonged vitality, entering the realm of **Blessings and Virtue**. May the **Superior Officials of the Upper Registry** inspect his fate, dissect his years, his birth month and conception day, his past and present calamities, and harmonize all malevolent influences, thus petitioning on his behalf:\n\nTo the **Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns**, the **Long-Life Marshal**, and the **Substitute Form Degree-Commissioner**, along with the **Southern Palace Marshal** and **Supervisors of Birth**—each thirty-two in number—riding **Flying Dragons and Feathered Chariots**, and the **Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns**, with armies and officials numbering nine hundred million each, all converging to present this petitioner’s **golden effigy and purple silk**, ascending to the **Thirty-Two Heavens**, traversing the stars to verify his宿命 (*host-fate*), within the **Celestial Registrar’s Hall**, exchanging his name and form. Further, this petitioner requests that the **True Gods and Primordial Vital Breath** descend into his body, re-inscribing his name in the living ledger and extending his life without end.\n\nAdditionally, this petitioner requests:\n- The **Five Lords of Extended Lifespan** and **One Hundred Twenty Officials**, converging to present the **golden effigy and purple silk tokens**, ascending to the **Pure Clarity Primordial Vital Breath Palace**, humbly petitioning the **Star-Degree Commissioner**, the **Name-Exchange Form Commissioner**, and the **Death-to-Life Commissioner**. Further, the **Functional Registrar Officials** and the **Great Yin Summoning and Reviewing Commissioner** shall present the **golden effigy and purple silk**, descending to the **Northern Dipper Great Yin Consort’s First Layer of the Underworld**, within the **Great Yin’s Dead Registry Vault**, exchanging this petitioner’s name and form, inscribing his living name in the **Jade Calendar of the Living Ledger**, and extending his life without limit.\n\nMoreover, this petitioner requests:\n- **[Illegible] Lords**, five in number, with one hundred twenty officials each,\n- The **Five Sovereigns of Ten Thousand Blessings and Disaster Relief**, with one hundred twenty officials each,\n- The **Three Heavenly Lords of Calamity Relief** and the **Five Lords of Harm Relief**, converging to dissolve the **year, month, day, and hour** of this petitioner’s birth that clash with the **Five Stars and Twenty-Eight Constellations**, as well as the **Malevolent Host** and **Evil Constellations**. May the **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper** erase his name from the dead registry, may **Acquisition and Mars** sever his fate of death, may **Luck and Uprightness** exchange his form of death, may **Literature and Martial** remove his name from the dead records, and may the **Heavenly Ropes and Broken Army** spare him from lethal *qi*.\n\nMay the **Three High Tribunals** relieve this petitioner of the **Six Calamities** of his lifespan—**excessive punishment, disease, death, and mourning**, the calamities of **years, months, days, and hours**, the calamities of **Heaven and Earth**, of **prisons**, of **bandits and war**, and of the **Four Seasons and Five Phases (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth)**—and may all **thousand malevolences and ten thousand calamities** be absolved and transcended.\n\n«May I humbly petition the **Nine Mysteries of the Eastern Extremity**—the **Verdant Sovereign, Qingdi**, the **Lord of Supervising Life and Commanding Death**, the **Lord of Exchanging Names and Transforming Forms**, and the **Lord of Daoist Immortals and Transcending the World**, each one person, along with **nine million soldiers**, to ride upon **Qingyun Feathered Chariots**, traverse ten thousand leagues, and descend in unison. May they bear my **substitute golden effigy with purple markings** to the **Palace of Eternal Life**, where Qingdi wears his ceremonial insignia, and may they exchange my name and transform my form, inscribing me into the **Jade Register of Life** for endless longevity.\n\nMay I further petition the **Southern Extremity, Nanchang Palace**—the **Crimson Sovereign**, the **Lord of Supervising Life and Commanding Death**, the **Lord of Exchanging Names and Transforming Forms**, the **Lord of Original Qi and Receiving Birth**, and the **Lord of Daoist Immortals and Transcending the World**, each one person, along with **nine million soldiers**, to ride upon **Crimson Cloud Feathered Chariots**, traverse ten thousand leagues, and descend in unison. May they bear my **substitute golden effigy with purple markings** to the **Palace of Eternal Life in the Southern Extremity**, where the Crimson Sovereign wears his ceremonial insignia, and may they exchange my name and transform my form, inscribing me into the **Jade Register of Life** for endless longevity.\n\nMay I further petition the **Western Extremity, White Substance Palace**—the **White Sovereign**, the **Lord of Supervising Life and Commanding Death**, the **Lord of Exchanging Names and Transforming Forms**, the **Lord of Original Qi and Receiving Birth**, and the **Lord of Daoist Immortals and Transcending the World**, each one person, along with **nine million soldiers**, to ride upon **White Cloud Feathered Chariots**, traverse ten thousand leagues, and descend in unison. May they bear my **substitute golden effigy with purple markings** to the **Palace of White Clouds**, where they exchange my name and transform my form, inscribing me into the **Jade Register of Life** for endless longevity, and may the White Sovereign wear his ceremonial insignia to grant me endless life.\n\nMay I further petition the **Northern Extremity, Mysterious Dipper Palace of Great Yin**—the **Black Sovereign**, the **Lord of Supervising Life and Commanding Death**, the **Lord of Exchanging Names and Transforming Forms**, the **Lord of Original Qi and Receiving Birth**, and the **Lord of Daoist Immortals and Transcending the World**, each one person, along with **nine million soldiers**, to ride upon **Mysterious Cloud Feathered Chariots**, traverse ten thousand leagues, and descend in unison. May they bear my **substitute golden effigy with purple markings** to the **Palace of Great Yin**, where the Black Sovereign attends to the **Yin Court of the Dark Palace** and the **Registry of Death in the Jade Vaults and Wardrobes**. May they exchange my name and transform my form, inscribing me into the **Jade Register of Life** for endless longevity, and may the Black Sovereign wear his ceremonial insignia to grant me endless life.\n\nMay I further petition the **Central Extremity, High Imperial Palace of the Thirty-Two Heavens**—the **Yellow Sovereign**, the **Lord of Supervising Life and Commanding Death**, the **Lord of Exchanging Names and Transforming Forms**, the **Lord of Original Qi and Receiving Birth**, and the **Lord of Daoist Immortals and Transcending the World**, each one person, along with **nine million soldiers**, to ride upon **Yellow Cloud Feathered Chariots**, traverse ten thousand leagues, and descend in unison.

May they dispel my **Twelve Native Taboos of the Current Year**, shatter the **restraining and binding forces of the Five Phases**, and absolve me from **major and minor assemblies, the Five Punishments and Nine Calamities, the Five Malevolences and Six Harms, and the Nine Hostile Declines**. May they harmonize the **Five Viscera** and balance the **Six Palaces**, and may all **hundreds of diseases** be eradicated.\n\nMay I further petition the **Lord of the Circulating Cauldron** to govern the **Palace of the Great Officials**, and for him to harmonize my **destiny and records**, circulate through the **Eight Extremities**, remove my name from the **Dead Register**, inscribe my living name, transcend the **One Hundred Twenty Life-Generating Qi**, and prolong my years without aging.\n\nMay I further petition the **Lord of the Southern Register** to govern the **Palace of the Listed Vaults**, with **One Hundred Twenty Officials and Generals**.\n\nMay I further petition the **Lord of the Circulating Jade** to govern the **Palace of the Earthly Geography**, clad in **Rainbow Robes and Crimson Cloth**, with a **Dan Yang headband and a Heaven-Piercing Crown**, and with **One Hundred Twenty Officials and Generals**.\n\nMay I further petition the **One Thousand Two Hundred Jade Maidens of the Circulating Cauldron**, dressed in **Rainbow Attire**, to descend in unison.

Though I have been fortunate to belong to the Daoist path and preserve myself through its teachings, I have been graced with the Master’s benevolence, and my household remains upright and harmonious—yet I rejoice in this blessing.\n\nHowever, as a mortal of shallow understanding, my transgressions have accumulated, and from recent years onward, I have been restless in sleep, plagued by nightmares and spectral apparitions. My waking and dreaming states are confused, and I frequently see the departed and the transformed appearing before me, causing me to tremble in great and small terror. Relying upon the **Great Dao** for treatment, I humbly petition the **Disciple** to intercede on my behalf, seeking deliverance and protection.\n\nWith reverence, I submit this memorial to the **Heavenly Exalted**, praying for the **Great Dao’s** compassion toward this mortal, that all calamities and afflictions may be dispelled.\n\nIf there be lingering **qi of the past**, the **Yearly Star**, the **Great General of Yin**, or the **Twelve Monthly Deities** presiding over fate, along with the **Eight Outer Gods** before and behind, the **Restraining Officials of the Five Punishments**, the **Hidden Dragon** within the dwelling, the **Seven Prison Clerks**, the **Delayed and Malevolent Killers**, the **Four Directions’ Wandering Spirits**, the **Hanging Corpses’ Six Calamities**, the **Twelve Lower Seductions**, and the **Guest Ghosts** lodging within—may all these malevolent forces be utterly dispersed.\n\nI earnestly request the **Ten Thousand Spirit Lords**, five in number, with their **One Hundred Twenty Officers**, to act as my guardians, reversing death into life, turning misfortune into blessing, repelling the lingering **qi**, and dispelling the **precise malevolent influences** and **lodging ghosts**.\n\nFurther, I request the **Lord of Heavenly Prosperity**, with his **Ten Thousand Yellow-Clad Soldiers**, to subdue the **strong malevolent forces** within and beyond my household, the **Twelve Punishments**, and the **ghosts of dreams and waking**.\n\nAgain, I request the **Lord of the Sun**, one in number, with his **One Hundred Twenty Officers**, assisting the **Lan Officials**, to treat my restless sleep and terrifying specters, causing them all to vanish.\n\nIf there are **Twelve Tomb Litigants** and **strong malevolent forces** from the graves, along with all their entanglements, may they be expelled by the **Three Qi**, severing their connections so they cannot torment future generations.\n\nFinally, I request the **Lord of the Heavenly Center, the Bold and Resolute**, with his **One Hundred Twenty Officers**, to capture and apprehend the **malevolent spirits** of my departed ancestors who linger as **Delayed and Malevolent Killers**, delivering them to the **Northern Prison of Female Verdict** for punishment.\n\nMay all my afflictions be entirely removed, allowing me to rest peacefully without further terror or nightmares.\n\nBy the **Grace of the Most High**,\n\n「The Most High, in His distinction, grants me one chance.\n\nFor the departed souls of my household, I humbly repent and atone for their sins, seeking absolution.\n\nWith all due rites and ranks observed, I submit this petition:\n\nIn accordance with the records, I, [Name], am a descendant of one who was once of lowly official status. In the course of fate’s turning, he encountered the Great Transformation, maintaining faith and allegiance to secure his well-being. By the Grace of the Most High, he received both great and small blessings and consolations.\n\nYet through my own stubborn ignorance, my worship and offerings have been repeatedly deficient, thus inviting retribution.\n\nRecently, misfortunes have plagued our household—no good fortune has come our way. My body now suffers from illness, as described above.\n\nIn deep reflection, I realize the source of these calamities: the lingering malevolent spirits of the departed.\n\nI fear that in his lifetime, the departed [Name] committed crimes—betraying loyalty and filial piety, lacking benevolence and compassion, harboring jealousy and resentment, slandering and cursing others, invoking heavens and earth in vain, and summoning deities in vain.\n\nOr perhaps he was greedy for wealth, stole, or acted unjustly, altering his deeds to no avail. In all ways, his actions were unvirtuous, leading to severe judgment and striking his body in the afterlife.\n\nI fear that after his death, he may suffer harsh punishment, his spirit enduring trials before the Three Officials, compelled to labor under torment, unable to bear the suffering. His afflictions may then extend to the living, causing our household to endure continuous retribution and calamities, with no end to the torment—both in life and death—from which we cannot escape.\n\nThe fundamental truth rests upon the **Dao/Way** and the **qi** of the spirits.\n\nNow, I enumerate all the crimes committed by the departed in his lifetime, presenting them for judgment, and offer my own possessions as pledge, to demonstrate my sincerity and redeem the countless offenses he made.\n\nAs one of lowly station and limited understanding of the **qi** of spirits, I humbly accept this burden and submit this petition, bowing to the heavens.\n\nI earnestly pray that the **Most High Dao/Way** and the disciples under the **Heavenly Master’s** teaching may extend their compassionate and benevolent grace, examining my plea and granting me favor according to the **Most High’s** decree of first repentance. Thus, may the departed [Name]’s offenses be forgiven, and his lingering retribution be absolved and dispelled.\n\nThe **Functional Officials’** messengers shall hold me accountable for my sincerity, and I shall be summoned to the **Three Celestial Officials’** court. There, my lifetime crimes shall be reviewed, and the records of his offenses shall be expunged, erasing all charges and extinguishing the causes of his torment.\n\nI respectfully request the **Supreme Mystic’s** true talisman and decree, commanding the **Female Verdict’s** edict, the **Two Thousand Stone Officials** beneath the earth, the **Mound Wardens** and **Tomb Marshals**, the **Twelve Tomb Litigants**, the **Twenty-Four Prisons of Tai Mountain**, the **Great Prison of Central Capital**, the **Northern Prison of Heavenly Unity**, the **Nine Equitable Prisons of the Sovereign**, the **Three Officials of Heaven and Earth and Water**, the **River Marshal** and **River Lord**, the **Assisting Spirits** and **Officials of Connections**, and all others—may they release my ancestors’ spirits, allowing them to return and reattach to their remains, freeing them from imprisonment and suffering. May they ascend to the **Three Celestial Officials’** realm of peace and harmony, severing all retribution and eradicating the records of their deaths.\n\nIf my ancestors were bound by the **Five Oaths** and **Seven Curses** in their lifetime, and their spirits remain entangled and unable to be released, I beg that all such ties be dissolved and they be set free.\n\nFrom this day forward, may my household be granted stability in life and death, prosperity in our gates, and the removal of all illnesses. May this be a testament to my faith and sincerity.»\n\n---\n\n「With deepest gratitude, I humbly address the **Supreme Sovereign of the Highest Dao** (太上). I seek pity, beseeching:\n\n*\"In accordance with the sacred scriptures, I, [Name], was born in mortal flesh, a descendant of the officials of the Dao. Though fortunate across a thousand generations, I failed to uphold the precepts and often violated the commandments, thereby incurring retribution and punishment. Before my time, I suffered from illness, yet was not spared—on the [date], I surrendered my life to the **Three Celestial Officials** (三官). Since then, my lingering **malignant qi** (疾气) has tormented me.\n\nI fear that my past sins and misdeeds, both in life and after death, whether recent or ancient, have entangled my spirit, binding it in torment within the **Three Celestial Officials’** domain. Unable to endure the suffering, my spirit strikes against the living. In my profound grief and sorrow, I know not how to earn **virtue/power** (功德) to redeem myself. Thus, I solemnly vow to sell my living garments and possessions to atone for my departed soul, severing its suffering and returning it to the path of salvation.\n\nI, your humble servant, submit this prayer of supplication (求乞章奏). In the mercy of the **Supreme Dao** (大道), which cherishes the living and comforts the dead, I trust that all who turn to it—both living and deceased—find reliance. May those spirits in deepest darkness be granted ascension and liberation, as the **Dharma Wheel** (法轮) rolls forth to guide them back into the **Way** (道).\n\nWith a heart sincere and devoted, I dare not presume upon Your boundless compassion. I humbly pray that You, the **Supreme Sovereign of the Highest Dao, the Ultimate Truth** (太上无极至真), may hear my plea and grant forgiveness to my past and present self, extending Your care to me.\n\nI earnestly request the **General of the White Horse and Sixteen Thousand Soldiers** (素车白马将军), along with his ten thousand troops, and **Lord Taixuan** (太玄君), with his hundred and twenty officers, to locate my tormented spirit and, if it lingers in the **Three Realms of Retribution** (三徒), or is recorded in the **Six Heavenly Courts** (六天), to liberate it entirely.\n\nI further request the **Celestial Official of Great History** (大历君), with his hundred and twenty officers, to govern the **Western Water Palace** (西水宫); and the **Sacred Taixuan Talisman** (太玄真符) to inform the **Three Celestial Officials** (天地水三官), the **Lady Qing** (女青), the **Earthly Officials of Two Thousand Stone** (地下二千石), the **Mound Wardens and Tomb Lords** (丘丞墓伯), the **Twelve Grave Spirits** (十二冢神), the **Twenty-Four Prisons of Mount Tai** (泰山二十四狱), the **Great Central Prison** (中都大狱), the **Northern Prison of Heaven One** (天一北狱), the **Nine Heavenly Prisons of the Imperial Dao** (皇天九平狱), the **Eastern Mount Tai Earthly Prison** (东岳泰山地狱), the **Southern Mount Heng Earthly Prison** (南岳衡山地狱), the **Western Mount Hua Earthly Prison** (西岳华山地狱), the **Northern Mount Bu Earthly Prison** (北岳但山地狱), the **Central Mount Song Earthly Prison** (中岳嵩山地狱), the **Northern Cold Pool Prison** (北都寒池牢槛) and all others, the **Nine Rivers Water Emperor** (九江水帝), the **River Lords and River Officials** (河侯河伯), the **Assisting Spirits and Officials of Connections** (将佐掾吏), and all others—may they release my spirit, erase its crimes, remove its punishments, free it from imprisonment, and grant it a cleansing bath, robes of honor, and ascension to the **Hall of Blessings** (福堂). May it return to its original form, be reborn in the **Gate of Virtue** (善门), and sever all records of death in the **Six Heavenly Courts** (六官). May my name be inscribed in the **Celestial Register of Merit** (丹籍), and may all my afflictions be healed.\n\nWith heartfelt sincerity, I earnestly pray for Your mercy. My sins and transgressions are countless—only Your forgiveness I beg.\n\nWith deepest gratitude, I humbly address the **Supreme Sovereign of the Highest Dao** (太上).」\n\nThe **Supreme Sovereign of the Highest Dao** (太上) discerns and grants distinction.\n\nI seek Your mercy.\n\n**Sutra of Eradicating the Three Torments and Five Sufferings, of Releasing the Corpse from Torment, and of Attaining Peace, Renewal, and Rebirth** (灭度三涂五苦炼尸受度适意更生章) – with due reverence to the sacred scriptures:\n\nI humbly submit: According to the written records, this lowly and unworthy servant (臣以凡愚) had meager deeds in past lives, though born into the human realm (生人道), traversing this defiled world (履於秽世). Stained by dust and impurity, I deemed myself doomed to perdition, despairing of celestial paths. Yet by Your boundless compassion (皇极哀矜), I escaped punishment and, through sheer fortune, passed the barriers to partake in the **Three Pure Ones’ True Scriptures** (三景真经).\n\nThough I strove to discipline myself, I was ensnared by the **corpse insects** (尸虫), burdened by cravings, and transgressed precepts in every matter. Now, in the **ninth solar cycle of this present life** (今阳九运促), the reckoning has begun, and my deeds are lost while my sins are manifest—I cannot free myself. I constantly fear the sudden and unmarked end of life, though I yearn for self-renewal, yet my bonds remain unsevered, and my **merit of greenness** (善绿) has not yet arrived.\n\nDaring to present this **remaining life of punishment** (刑余之命) at the **Three Gates of Judgment** (三掠之门), I offer my blind and sincere supplication (冒陈瞽诚), humbly beseeching Your divine truth (干杵天真), with trembling reflection.\n\nYour servants (某等) are sincerely awestruck and fearful, prostrating in deepest contrition (顿首死罪死罪).\n\nYour servant observes the **scriptural intent** (经旨) clearly warns against precepts, yet there is room for Your compassion (有可凭恩).\n\nThe **Scripture** (经) states: *\"Unless one’s past life accumulated virtue (有善), merits across countless kalpas (累劫之功), and had their name recorded on jade tablets (名书琼简), they cannot presumptuously behold the precious scriptures.\"* Those who have foreseen them should all ascend in degree (皆应升度). Yet some, whose virtue and merit are insufficient, whose debts of life and death are unpaid, have not yet attained **daytime liberation** (白日飞腾). Others, having taken **corpse rebirth** (托尸解), temporarily pass through the **Great Yin** (太阴), their **soul and spirit** (魂神) enduring interrogation, lodged in the **Earthly Courts** (地官), until the **term of greenness** (绿期) concludes and they return to their former abode, ascending together in due time.\n\nIf the **Divine Intent** (灵旨) is as sincerely proclaimed, then those who follow the law still have hope (犹有可冀).\n\nThus, this humble servant dares to express my observations (敢申所见).\n\nThere exists in the present day a certain individual from [County] of [District] in [Province], aged [X] years, with the given name [Certain], born under the reign of [Certain Emperor], in the [month] of [year], receiving his life mandate from [Certain Heavenly Deity]. During his lifetime, he was drawn to the Dao and aspired to its teachings, seeking out Daoist master [Name], ascending the altar to take vows, and receiving the *San Jing Dong Jing* (三景洞经). He offered reverent worship, periodically observing fasts and rituals. Yet, though his body now lies in the lower realm, entangled by defilements, his virtue and merit remain unfulfilled, his roots of karmic extinction not yet severed. As the Divine Intent foretells, though his form has perished, he should be among those who attain corpse rebirth (尸解).\n\nFearful that, due to his uncompleted term of greenness (因绿未定) and insufficient prior merit (先功未充), he departed this life on the [month], [day], at the [hour], entering the Great Yin (托灭太阴) and his form lodged in the Earthly Courts (形寄土官). Now his coffin rests in the funeral hall, awaiting a favorable hour for relocation to the ancestral burial ground. Yet, with his virtue still insufficient, it would be premature to hasten his transfer, lest he be seen and driven by the Earthly officials (土府), finding no place of rest. His soul may scatter, his corpse unsettled, his spirit agitated by interrogations, bound again to cyclic existence (魂飞魄扬，尸形匪宁，摇动考对，注连复生).\n\nThis humble servant, in a past life bound by the term of greenness (因绿) to him as a celestial kin (忝结天亲), both dwelling in this mundane age, harbors deep concern. Though the sacred bond (灵契) is fixed, I cannot rest in peace. On the day of my appointment, my foremost duty was to guide the living toward liberation. Now, I humbly rely upon [Your Exalted Authority] to...\n\nThe **Supreme Venerable of the Non-Extreme Dao/Way, the Primordial Great Transformation, the Essence of Manifest Truth, and the Rectified Unity Sect**—with reverent fasting and prostration—now humbly presents this memorial for imperial edict.\n\nMay the **Great Compassion** take pity and forgive the sins and offenses committed by **Certain One** in past lives and during his earthly existence: all roots of the **Three Abysses** and the **Five Sufferings**, those recorded in the **Three Officials’ Nine Registries**, under the judgment of divine censors, beneath the **celestial enforcers’ hammers and rods**, bound to **Mountains of Knives and Trees of Swords**, or imprisoned in the **Nine Dark Realms of Hell**—may this memorial be granted to petition the **Three Officials**, that **Certain One’s** merits from his lifetime be credited, his **soul and spirit** liberated, and his **former body** restored.\n\nShould **Certain One’s** spirit depart and his **vital essence** disperse, his flesh decayed and rotted, may the **Five Sovereigns and Divine Spirits** restore his **flesh and skin**, nourish his **soul and spirit**, and let the **Three Luminaries** (sun, moon, stars) sustain him with their essence, infusing him with the **Great Primordial Spring**, unblocking his **meridians and vessels**, moistening his **blood and qi**—so that those destined to **transform** may transform, those destined to **be liberated** may be liberated, and those destined to **be reborn** may be reborn.\n\nMay the **True and Upright Spirits** of **Certain One’s** ancestral **mountain and peak**, as well as the **Nine Earthly Officials** under their jurisdiction, be commanded by this talisman to provide all necessary sustenance, in strict accordance with the **Doctrine of Manifest Truth**.\n\nThus, his **form shall be at peace, his spirit secure**, his **vital essence undispersed**, his **guilt instantly purged**, and his **spirit restored to its original dwelling**.\n\nMay this memorial, once granted by **Your Celestial Authority**, allow **Certain One** to undergo **alchemical rebirth in his corpse**, restore his **former body**, and ascend as a **True Immortal**.\n\nHumbly praying that the **Celestial Master’s attendants** may grant this **earnest plea**.\n\nIf this petition is approved, the **Dao/Way’s compassionate transformation** shall be boundless, and this humble servant’s **devotion shall not be in vain**.\n\nMay the **Celestial Master’s discernment** be granted.\n\n**Supplication concluded.**\n\nA memorial for **Certain One’s**—\n**Extinguishing the Form and Spirit, Liberating from the Three Officials’ Nine Registries, Eradicating the Roots of the Three Abysses and the Five Sufferings, Opening the Nine Dark Hells, Restoring Soul and Spirit, Alchemically Rebirth in the Corpse, and Fulfilling a Renewed Life**—\nis now respectfully submitted to the **Celestial Master’s Court of [Specific Palace]**.\n\n**Awaiting notification.**\n\n**Memorial for [Certain One’s] Funeral and Burial**\n\nRespectfully submitted: the **rites and arrangements** for funeral and burial.\n\nHumbly, in accordance with the records, this **Certain One** of the **Dao/Way** has committed a grave offense—**inviting misfortune and calamity**—and thus the departed **Certain One** met their end in the year of **[specific year]**, month **[specific month]**, day **[specific day]**, at the hour **[specific time]**, by decree of the **Three Officials**. Their remains were temporarily housed within **[specific location]**, yet they have not yet been interred.\n\nIt is now decreed that on this **[specific month]**, **[specific day]**, at **[specific time]**, the **Certain One’s** coffin shall be **temporarily moved** from **[specific location]**, and their remains shall be **properly buried** at **[specific place]**.\n\nThis **Certain One** has been **entrusted to the Pure and True**, and has **surrendered sincerely to the Dao/Way’s qi**. They shall not **consult divination or seek guidance from mortal masters**, lest they be **harmed by the General of the Grand Year (太歲將軍)**, the **Twelve Monthly Deities (十二月建)**, the **Hooked Executioner (鈎刑)**, the **Retributive Officials (下官故氣)**, or the **Thousand Prohibitions and Ten Thousand Taboos (千禁万忌)**. Thus, they **prayfully submit this request to the Celestial Master**, seeking **protection from such harm**.\n\nThis **Certain One** was a **devoted Daoist**, whose ways differ from the common folk. In matters of **funeral rites and burial**, they observe **no prohibitions or taboos**. As a **single-hearted devotee**, their case is **worthy of compassion and pity**.\n\n**Respectfully requesting** the presence of the **Five Pure and True Sovereigns (太素太始君五人)** and the **One Hundred Twenty Official Guards (官將百二十人)**, as well as **Twelve Burial Attendants (葬埋吏十二人)**.

Truly, this fills us with joy and gratitude.*\n\n*\"Additionally, through the **Master’s Dao (師道)** and compassionate insight, we have been granted the **Great and Lesser Heavenly Official Talismans (大小天官箓治)**. The favor is profound and boundless.*\n\n*\"Though born as fleshly beings in the **end of the age (末俗)**, we failed to diligently cultivate **virtue and merit (功德)**, repaying the **Enlightened Sovereign’s** benevolence.

As a result, our household has declined, misfortunes never ceasing.*\n\n*\"Before their passing, this household suffered from illness, yet was not pardoned. On the [deceased’s] year, month, and day, their life was claimed by the **Three Officials (三官)**.

The **Yin and Yang** are paired, the **male and female** follow in harmony. The **Yang** leads, the **Yin** responds, the **male** acts, the **female** follows.

太上分别。」\nMay the grace of the **Supreme Dao (太上)** be forever bestowed.»\n\nI humbly petition for mercy.\n**Memorial of Accepting an Official Post**\n\nWith due rank and position, I respectfully state:\nBy examining the official records, I, [Name], as a lowly official, was born in ignorance yet fortunate to encounter this era of prosperity. Grateful for the heavens’ and earth’s benevolent light, I have been granted a place among the common folk.\n\nIn my former service under [Name]’s court, upon fulfilling my duties, I was promoted to the post of [Name]. The royal command having been issued, I dare not delay. On the appointed day when I received the seal and tablet, I bowed in reverence to the Dao’s pure and refined *qi*, and without regard for the times or rulers, I turned to my teacher’s Way and now submit this memorial to seek mercy.\n\nI humbly present this petition to the throne, requesting:\nOne **Juzhuque Lord (朱雀君)**, with one hundred twenty officers, to oversee the **Luo Ping Palace (洛平宫)**, ensuring harmony among the people and joy among guests—so that all may feast with laughter and no grievance remains.\n\nFurther, I request:\nOne **Lord of Ranked Officials (位官受爵君)**, with one hundred twenty officers each,\nAnd one **Lord of the Four Quarters’ Barbarians (四方夷蛮戎狄君)**, with one hundred twenty officers each—all to be summoned together to guard me.\n\nAfter receiving the seal and tablet, may all malevolent *qi* of calamity and harm be dispelled, so that my career may flourish, my official tenure be prosperous, and my life secure and unburdened—thus fulfilling my pledge.\n\nThe officials I have requested shall be recorded by the **Central Palace (中宫)**, and I pray that no resentment may arise.\n\nMay the grace of the **Supreme Dao (太上)** be forever bestowed.\n\nI humbly request one **Celestial Official of the Hour (辰)**.\n\nIn the **Edict of Governing Officials and Attending to the People (临官莅民章)**, I submit my petition with proper rank and protocol:\n\n*\"I, [Name], a man of low wisdom, have been mistakenly favored by Your Great Grace, selected by the times, and appointed as Magistrate of [Chu] County. Having received the royal command, I must now govern the people and affairs of the realm.\n\nYet, in these times of deceit and corruption, where human and ghostly forces vie for power, and mortal efforts are insufficient to avert calamities, I now, on the [specific] day of this month, set forth on my journey. I shall arrive at my post on the [specific] day of the [specific] month, relying solely on the **Dao-qi (道气)**. I dare not consult omens or inquire of auspicious times.\n\nUpon entering my jurisdiction, I fear being harmed by the **land’s spirits and deities (土地精灵)**, the **ritual masters and ancestral shrines (符师社庙)**, lingering **qi of past feasts (饮食故气)**, the **General of the Year-Pillar (太岁将军)**, the **taboos along the Dao (道上禁诃)**, the **Five Phases’ Celestial Lords and their correspondences (五行王相)**, and the **forbidden omens of the *Kui* and *Gang* (魁纲诸忌)**. I therefore declare my arrival in advance and beseech protection.\n\nWith utmost reverence, I submit this petition, praying that the **Central Palace (上官)** may instruct the **local land deities (土地真官)**, the **postal couriers and relay stations (邮书驿骑)**, and the **watchtowers and villages (亭传里邑)** to clear the way and guard my person.\n\nI further request:\nOne **Lord of Prosperity and Decline (昌落君)**, with one hundred twenty officers,\nAnd one **General of Auspicious Protection (佑护将军)**, one **Lord of Ten Thousand Blessings (万福丈人)**, with their officers, to dispel all calamities.\n\nOne **Lord of Release and Exemption (解除禁害君)**, with one hundred twenty officers, along with the officials of the **Four Quarters’ Barbarians (四方夷蛮戎狄君)**, all assembled together below, to jointly guard my person, the **General of the Year-Pillar (太岁将军)**, the **Four Seasonal Celestial Depleters (四时王耗)**, and the **myriad prohibitions and omens (千禁万忌)**—so that my arrival and entry into office may be secure, my tenure free of strife, my speech unobstructed, my health serene, my career ascending, and my year’s end fulfilled with my wishes.\n\nMay the **times’ officials and officers** record my merits and report my labors.\n\nMay the grace of the **Supreme Dao (太上)** be forever bestowed.\"\n\nI humbly petition for a single auspicious hour.\n\n**Memorial for the Elimination of Obstructive Calamities**\n*(Submitted in proper rank and form)*\n\nI respectfully report: According to the official records, I have encountered this fateful juncture, granted the honor of serving in Qinghua, bearing the insignia of celestial officials, and receiving imperial favor in all my comings and goings. Truly, this fills me with profound gratitude and relief.\n\nFrom my ancestral lineage to the present, my family has inherited official rank and titles, all through the sovereign’s boundless grace. Now, I am unworthy of holding this office, and on this day, I reverently accept the royal command, relying entirely upon the Great Dao. Without divination or inquiry, without selecting a propitious day or hour, I proceed with a sincere heart.\n\nSince assuming this post, I have been plagued by unsettling dreams and waking visions, alternating with recurring illnesses and strange, inexplicable phenomena—unclear in their origin. Upon consulting the annual almanac and the celestial cycles of the Six Jia, I find that on the day I received my commission, my natal branch was Five Li, while my current year-branch was Jiawu, clashing with Zi. Moreover, I accepted the commission in the eleventh month—a month of decline. The Year-Pillar is [omitted], with [omitted] as the official killer and [omitted] as the grave killer, and I myself am the official killer, all converging in mutual assault.\n\nThe day’s influence descends upon the Six Harmonies, further compounded by the Six Calamities. I have heard that...\n\n「The Dao/Way knows no prohibitions or taboos; without sincerity and devotion, it cannot be attained. To avert calamities and repel misfortunes, they have come to inform me, seeking official documents. I humbly submit this request, hoping that the Way’s *qi* may flow downward.\n\nI respectfully petition the Heavenly Hall Lord, requesting a hundred and twenty officials, to govern the An Yang Palace, overseeing the removal of the Nine Heavenly Prohibitions. The one receiving the commission shall eliminate [them]. I further request the Heavenly King and his Thousand Two Hundred Immortal Maidens, clad in green robes, to collect the ten thousand people of the world, bestowing upon them titles and seals of gold and silver, granting them divine understanding, averting calamities and repelling misfortunes, and ensuring their lives span a hundred years. If, on the day I receive my appointment, the time should be Five Li, any malevolent spirits and myriad harms shall all be eliminated. I beg the High Official to dispatch the requested personnel accordingly.\n\nWithin my jurisdiction, there are so many officials—two hundred and forty in total. If it be a prefecture, there are twenty-four officials. If a commandery, eighteen officials. If a county, seven officials. All united in strength, they shall help me avert and repel evil, eliminate prohibitions, and ensure no other matters arise in office. Discussions and judgments shall be in harmony with virtue, officials and commoners alike shall rejoice, and thus I may be promoted in time, ending the year in stability.\n\nOn the day my wishes are fulfilled, the petitioned Heavenly Officials shall speak of my merits and labor, not betraying their trust in me. The favor is bestowed by the Supreme Sovereign.\n\nI beg for mercy. Request for Promotion to High Office\n\nWith proper rank, I submit: In accordance with the official documents, I have always been one born from the womb of flesh, with descendants of mere bones. Formerly, through the *Lèhuà* ritual, I was entrusted with the Way to preserve and govern myself. The grace bestowed upon me has been profound and generous, filling me with joy and comfort.\n\nDescended from a noble lineage, my family has long held officialdom as its profession. I have accumulated ranks as various officials, managing royal affairs with distinction, my name and reputation both flourishing. Now I return to this post, which is not something a mere mortal can achieve. I am deeply moved by the Way’s vast protection and care.\n\nMy current office holds the critical affairs of state, or perhaps lies beyond the frontiers, as the case may be. My duties encompass the grand governance of all under Heaven, where both officials and ministers are powerful, and the commoners, accustomed to their privileges, are all too familiar with deceit. There are many lawsuits, and justice is hard to discern. I fear that if my words or actions falter, I may incur blame and censure, and thus I humbly rely on the Way’s broad acceptance and supplication, seeking these officials to safeguard and protect me.\n\nThough unworthy, I bear great responsibility and cannot bear the burden of the mortals’ petitions. I dare to violate the solemnity of the court, humbly presenting this memorial, and hope for Your compassionate grace and protection.\n\nI earnestly request the Twelve Lords of the Nine Barbarians, Eight Man, Six Rong, and Five Di—each twelve in number—along with their officials, soldiers, and attendants, to encircle my residence, standing guard at my sides.\n\nI further petition the Five Lords of Ten Thousand Blessings, each with a hundred and twenty officials, to dispel lingering malevolent *qi* and vengeful spirits, to curse those who seek to harm me, and to repel death and bring life, to repel misfortune and bring blessings.\n\nI further petition the Five Lords of Great Stars, each with a hundred and twenty officials, to govern the Stone Immortal Palace, and to suppress the slanderous tongues of the commoners, so that false accusations cannot take root, and to restore them to their proper places, ensuring that commoners and officials alike meet with smiles and joy.\n\nI further petition the Lords of Auxiliary Generals and Ten Thousand Blessings, each with a hundred and twenty officials, to guard my person.\n\nI further petition the Lord of Azure Darkness, with a hundred and twenty officials, to govern the Great Gate Palace, suppressing the resentment, complaints, and malevolent *qi* of the office, preventing them from reaching me.\n\nI hope that when the Heavenly Officials arrive, their single attendant shall gather with the officials and commoners of my state, commandery, county, village, and hamlet, each following their respective lord, to surround and protect my person. They shall dispel evil spirits, pestilence, and epidemic *qi*, and any schemes of enticement and harm shall all be eliminated, allowing my heart to open and my mind to clear. I shall comprehend the wisdom of the Five Spirits, fully understand what is spoken, and act accordingly. My words shall be as trustworthy as those of a thousand mouths, my intentions as sincere as the deepest vows. My household shall be ever peaceful, and by year’s end, I shall achieve prosperity, benefiting both the public and private spheres, as proof of my devotion.\n\nOn that day, I shall speak of the merits of the Heavenly Officials, requesting their promotion, to repay their labor and suffering. I beg for forgiveness of all my great and small faults, my myriad sins. The favor is bestowed by the Supreme Sovereign.\n\nI further beg for mercy.」\n\nThe Most High and All-Venerable Celestial Worthies, distinguished by their ranks:\n\nThe **Steward of Martial Campaigns** presents his humble petition. In strict accordance with the official records, I, [Name], by birth a mortal of flesh and blood, a descendant of lowly officials, through the fortune of fate and the grace of the Great Transformation, have received the benevolent coverage of Heaven’s favor, truly filling me with joy and gratitude.\n\nYet, due to my own stubborn ignorance and accumulated sins—mountains high—disasters and calamities have continually befallen me.\n\nNow, the journey is long and arduous, traversing rivers and mountains, passing through Huai and Si, advancing toward the enemy’s strongholds. In the midst of white blades and poisoned steel, the clash of arms is fierce, and both civil and martial authorities press down upon me. The military laws are severe, execution swift, and those who wield power cruelly oppress others, forcing them into violence. My merits are meager, and I cannot avert misfortune.\n\nFearful that I may perish in this dire strait without escape, I rely upon the **Dao-qi** of the myriad people, humbly presenting this memorial to the **Treaty-Officer**, beseeching protection.\n\nWith deepest reverence, I prostrate myself and submit this petition, appealing to the **Nine Lords of the Eastern Barbarians**, the **Eight Lords of the Southern Snares**, the **Six Lords of the Western Steppe**, and the **Five Lords of the Northern Di**, twelve each in number. I further implore the **Thousand-Li Lord**, the **Ten-Thousand-Li General**, and the **General of Auspicious Protection**, that they may jointly guard and shield me, following and covering me wherever I may be, ensuring my constant safety.\n\nMay they repel all calamities—epidemics, malevolent spirits, and bandits—that I may escape the blades of war, transcend this peril, and find favor within the ranks, free from blame or censure, as proof of my sincerity.\n\nI shall then speak of my merits before the **Temporal Lords and officials**, repaying their labor and toil.\n\nThe grace is granted by the Most High and All-Venerable Celestial Worthies.\n\nI further beg for mercy.\n\n**Chapter of the Vermilion Pine Child**, Volume Six, concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**The Red Pine Master’s Petition Rituals**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *The Red Pine Master’s Petition Rituals*. Author unknown; according to scholarly consensus, compiled by Tang-dynasty Daoist priests. A manual of early Celestial Master Daoist petition rituals. Six juan in total. Base text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongxuan* section, *Petition Memorials* category.\n\n**The Red Pine Master’s Petition Rituals, Juan One**\n\nRespectfully following *The Supreme Perfection Regulations* and *The Red Pine Master’s Records*: In the Han dynasty, humans and spirits intermingled, and malevolent forces spread unchecked. The Most High, moved by compassion, descended upon Mount Heming and bestowed upon Heavenly Master Zhang the *Orthodox Unity Alliance Registers* of one hundred twenty ranks, along with one thousand two hundred official protocols, three hundred major petitions, and esoteric ritual texts—all to succor and heal the living.\n\nThe Heavenly Master then established twenty-four dioceses, disseminating the *Orthodox Unity* petitions and talismans, registering households, and transforming the people while widely practicing hidden virtue. Yet as the ages passed, the precious petitions were lost, and what remains today is but one or two parts in ten.\n\nFurther, according to the record: Red Pine Master asked Heavenly Elder Pingchang, “Why has the petition submitted on the *jichou* day gone unreported?” Pingchang replied, “I saw the petition-bearer arrive at the Heavenly Gate, but the gate was closed.” The Master asked again, “When does it open and close in the span of a day and night?” Pingchang answered in full, precisely as the ritual codes prescribe.\n\nMoreover, when people submit petitions, their purposes vary—some for the state and household, others for themselves, their kin, or deceased ancestors. Each case differs and must be distinguished accordingly.\n\nIt is also said: The lifespan and fate of every person are governed by stellar constellations. If one commits evil deeds, their name is recorded in the Black Register, causing their spirit to grow restless, their dreams troubled, their path beset by misfortune, and their years diminished. But for those of pure heart who revere the Dao and its methods, seeking petitions and talismans, their transgressions are erased, blessings arise, their emoluments and longevity increase, their ancestors ascend, and their wishes are fulfilled.\n\nAll petitions must first be accompanied by offerings, so that the divine luminaries may witness one’s sincerity. Without offerings, the gods will not accept them, and one will be rebuked for stinginess and reluctance to give.\n\nIt is further said: The offerings for petitions are not fixed—those of wealth may increase them, while the poor may reduce them. Yet even among high officials and affluent households, if they covet merit but begrudge their wealth, mimicking the poor in their offerings, such conduct will yield no benefit.\n\nThe codes state: For those who are destitute and impoverished, seeking petitions and jiao rituals, the master may provide the ritual offerings on their behalf.\n\nThough old petitions vary in purpose, they generally fall into three categories: those for the Son of Heaven, for nobles and high officials, and for commoners. Since ranks differ, their forms must not be conflated without distinction.\n\nThe codes also state: Offerings for petitions should be distributed to the poor to cultivate hidden virtue; the master must not use them entirely for himself. Calculating by tenths, the master may only take three parts for his own use. The celestial statutes are severe—those who violate them incur punishment from the Three Officials, their misfortune extending to nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude as lowly spirits. How could one not be cautious!\n\nNow, these matters are arranged and compared, with clear principles established, so that practitioners may know the proper order.\n\n**Petition Offerings**\n**Petition for Drought**",

Here, three grades are extracted as a standard.\n\n**Silk and Colors:**\nThe Son of Heaven uses purple silk in *pi* and *shu* quantities; princes and dukes use their life-color silk in *zhang* quantities; commoners use plain silk in *chi* quantities.\n\n**Ritual Coins:**\nThe Son of Heaven uses gold coins; princes and dukes use silver coins; commoners use copper coins.\n\n**Rice Offerings:**\nThe Son of Heaven offers three *shi* and six *dou*; princes and dukes offer two *shi* and four *dou*; commoners offer one *shi* and two *dou*.\n\n**Ritual Oil:**\nThe Son of Heaven offers one *shi* and two *dou*; princes and dukes offer six *dou* and four *sheng*; commoners offer two *dou* and two *sheng*.\n\n**Incense:**\nThe Son of Heaven offers a full *jin*; princes and dukes offer half a *jin*; commoners offer three or five *liang*.\n\n**Paper, Brushes, Ink, and Cinnabar:**\nThese are provided for the officiant to draft petitions, correct errors, and revise drafts. All petitions must include them; none may be omitted. Other items follow their original categories and quantities. Violations will result in a reduction of lifespan.\n\n**Petition Texts**\nWhen submitting a petition, first prepare a written statement listing one’s native place, village name, official title, full name, age, household members, living dependents, and the number of males and females, young and old. According to Daoist regulations, present the ritual offerings at a designated place to a designated master, requesting the submission of the petition. Humbly beseech compassion and special intervention. The statement should convey the matter plainly, without ornamentation—unrefined yet not crude, simple yet not ostentatious, truthful yet not deceitful, direct yet not unrestrained, articulate yet not verbose, modest yet not vulgar, pure yet not turbid. If sincerity is concise and earnest, it will move Heaven and Earth, stir spirits and gods, ascend to the celestial bureaus, and bring swift retribution.

Then declare:\n\n*\"Primordial Life True Person, Generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou, there is now a man or woman named so-and-so suffering from illness, who petitions me for aid and protection.

May the true officials, direct talisman messengers, and the hundred thousand myriad layers of Dao qi descend into this talisman by command. Let the spirits mobilize the qi, search out and expel evil spirits, execute demonic thieves, and deliver salvation to the celestial and human realms.\"*\n\nNext, visualize the five-colored true qi before the altar. Above the true qi, to the left and right, stand the Direct Talisman Lads, clad in vermilion robes and azure skirts. Before the altar stands a Talisman General in vermilion robes and a dark crown, girded with a sword and holding a battle-axe. To his left and right stand two Direct Talisman Attendants, wearing yellow caps, yellow skirts, and crimson-brown garments, each holding a sword. Before me are the sun on the left and the moon on the right, nine inches from my face, their radiance covering a vermilion vessel. Above my head are the Seven Stars, the stars upon my head, and the *piao* upon the vermilion vessel.\n\nOnce this is complete, recite thrice: *\"Conjoined Brightness of the Heavenly Thearch and the Sun.\"*\n\nThen, visualize the vermilion brush as a *tengshe*, hold the breath, and write the talisman.\n\n**General Method for Writing Talismans**\nFirst, outline the four sides of the talisman with azure ink, then write the talisman text within in cinnabar. If azure ink is unavailable, cinnabar may also be used.\n\nWhen writing talismans to cure illnesses caused by evil, use true cinnabar mixed with tiger bone. Once ground, dip the brush and write the talisman while reciting the incantation:\n\n*\"I solemnly command the true officials within my five bodily constituents: my hun-soul is the Heavenly Father, my po-soul is the Earthly Mother, my head is Lord Thunder, my hair is black clouds, my crown is the Bright Star, my forehead is the Vermilion Bird, my eyebrows are the Qilin, my eyes are the sun and moon, my nose is the Mighty Tiger, my upper lip is the Earl of Wind, my lower lip is the Master of Rain, my tongue is the Governor of the Nine Provinces, my throat is the Nine-Layered Tower, my left cheek is the Eastern Kingly Lord, my right cheek is the Queen Mother of the West, my ears are the Immortal Lads of Distant Hearing, my neck is the Heavenly Pillar, my shoulders are the Vajras, my elbows are the Mighty Warriors, my left arm is the Great General Xuanji of Expelling Barbarians, my right arm is the Great General Yuheng of Breaking Barbarians, my palms are fire chariots, my fingers are armored soldiers, my liver is the Green Thearch, my lungs are the White Thearch, my heart is the Red Thearch, my kidneys are the Black Thearch, my spleen is the Yellow Thearch, my intestines are the Yellow Dragon, my gallbladder is the Great One, my bladder is the River Earl, my blood is the Water Official, my sinews are the Heavenly Net, my bones are the Earthly Net, my hair is the Heavenly Snare, my feet are the White Horse, my forward steps are the Three Officials, each leading seventy million troops.

Grind the ink by rotating the inkstick leftward forty-nine times; the grinding stone should be treated likewise. The heading \"With respectful hearing\" should be placed one inch below the first bow. The supplicant’s surname should be placed three lines below \"With respectful hearing.\" \"Great Clarity\" should be placed three lines below the supplicant’s surname. \"Great Year\" should be placed three lines below \"Great Clarity.\"\n\nIf a memorial is completed but contains minor matters, it may not be submitted for a year. If small characters have not yet been added, it may be submitted within a month. For small characters: the upper measure is three inches and five *fen*, the middle measure four inches and five *fen*, and the lower measure five inches—no more than this. Many today speak of one inch and five *fen*, which is incorrect. When the memorial reaches \"Great Year,\" if the paper is exhausted, it may not be submitted. If there is a presiding officer to deliver it, then it may. If two lines remain, the paper may be fully extended to continue.\n\nFor errors or omitted characters: small memorials should not exceed three characters; large memorials should be judged by context. When writing memorials, leave eight *fen* of space at the top and allow the bottom to extend to the edge of the paper. Place a cloth on the desk when writing memorials; do not let them touch the bed. Do not place clothing on the memorial or let it fall to the ground.\n\nWhen writing memorials, enter a state of stillness. Do not allow ordinary people to cause disturbance, nor discuss other matters or speak of foul or defiling things. When writing memorials, do not dip the brush in water or in the mouth. Keep the mouth closed, do not eat anything, and avoid exhaling forcefully. Wash hands clean and face north when writing. If the body has been defiled, do not write memorials. Do not write incomplete or flawed characters, nor use torn or damaged paper. Do not drink alcohol, eat meat, or expose oneself to foul odors. Dress in proper attire; do not expose the body.\n\nWhen writing memorials, one must prostrate oneself in reverence; do not squat or sit casually. After completing a memorial, first proofread it once before submitting it. The character \"Your servant\" (*chen*) must not appear at the beginning of a line, nor should it be placed where the living and dead are juxtaposed. The character for \"ghost\" must not occupy the start of a line. Do not tear out or damage a person’s name, nor allow others to secretly read it, lest it disturb the Great Clarity. The characters for \"sun\" and \"moon\" should not be written in advance; they should be added at the time of submission.\n\nIf submitting an urgent memorial, use a vermilion brush for the heading. When submitting a memorial to expel ghosts, write in vermilion the name of the Orthodox Unity disciple submitting it. For memorials to cure illnesses caused by malevolent spirits, use blue paper. The Lords and Officers of the Three Officials hold blue in high esteem. For memorials to strike down ghostly illnesses caused by *zhu* qi, write in vermilion on blue paper.\n\nAfter the memorial is submitted, burn it in the place of treatment. Grind two parts of true cinnabar and mix with honey to form pills. At dawn, enter the oratory, bow twice, and consume them—even those at death’s door will revive. Let no one know of this.\n\nIf writing a memorial due to illness while in the oratory, burn incense on all four sides.\n\n**Three Primordial Days**\nThe fifteenth day of the first month is the Upper Primordial.",

The Five La Days mark the end of the five phases’ cycles, when the old and new intersect. They are auspicious for seeking the Dao, invoking mercy, and receiving the descending life-qi to augment one’s spirit and extend one’s destiny. On these days, the Five Emperors convene in the Mystic Capital to govern the human realm, the underworld, the Five Marchmounts, the Four Waterways, and the thirty-six thousand yin and yang forces, reviewing and extending the lives of mortals. Those who cultivate the Dao and seek immortality should observe these days with fasting, ablutions, and rituals to the Perfected.\"\n\n\"Now, I transmit this profound teaching for diligent practice:\n- **First day of the first month (Heavenly La)**: The Five Emperors review mortals’ spirit-qi and lifespans, augmenting their years. This day is suitable for praying for offspring, sacrificing to ancestors, and ascending to the Mystic Ancestors. Avoid blocking ditches or indulging in labor or lust; instead, chant hymns and guide the spirit-qi.\n- **Fifth day of the fifth month (Earthly La)**: The Five Emperors review mortals’ ranks, physical vitality, and longevity, recording the names of those destined for immortality. This day is suitable for repenting sins, seeking promotions, and sacrificing to the Mystic Ancestors. Avoid felling trees or consuming blood; practice qi-absorption and harmonize the Four Great Elements.\n- **Seventh day of the seventh month (Moral La)**: The Five Emperors review mortals’ skeletal health, scholarly pursuits, and official ranks. This day is suitable for repenting sins, seeking blessings, absorbing qi, bathing, and sacrificing to ancestors. Avoid felling trees, crushing stones, or consuming sour or salty foods; do not ride near perilous places. Practice guiding and stretching the sinews.\n- **First day of the tenth month (People’s Year La)**: The Five Emperors review mortals’ emoluments, ranks, lifespans, and illnesses. This day is suitable for repenting sins, seeking extended destiny, sacrificing to ancestors, and bathing for the Mystic Ancestors. Avoid overeating or drunken stupor; instead, perform rituals and circumambulate altars.\n- **Twelfth month (Kings and Lords La)**: The Five Emperors review mortals’ dwellings, emoluments, and the distribution of the Three Luminaries’ qi to the thirty-six thousand spirits. This day is suitable for repenting sins, seeking longevity, pacifying the hundred spirits, altering one’s status, reversing poverty, bathing, sacrificing to ancestors, and performing grand rituals to the Heavenly Officials to fulfill wishes and attain the Dao. Avoid feasting or revelry; instead, practice purity while traversing sacred mountains or altars, reciting scriptures, and focusing the three hun and seven po.

      "translated_text": "**Regulations on Defilement and Impurity**\n\nThe statutes prescribe: When a household experiences a death, regardless of age, or when a woman gives birth, the defilement for a major funeral shall last one hundred days. For childbirth, as it harms the woman’s body, the defilement shall also last one hundred days. Entering the chamber of a woman in labor incurs three days of defilement. The death of a child or servant incurs one month of defilement. The death of livestock incurs one day of defilement. If the death occurs outside the household, there shall be no defilement. For a one-year mourning period, the defilement lasts forty days. For *da gong* and *si ma* mourning, defilement applies within the month; after the month has passed, it is lifted. Visiting a bereaved household to weep incurs defilement for that day. Prolonged mourning incurs no defilement. One must not partake of sacrificial food at a funeral, nor of food offered three days after childbirth or at the full-month celebration. None of the aforementioned defilements may engage in purification rites, set up *jiao* offerings, or present memorials. If encountered elsewhere, the defilement may be dispelled with talismanic water.\n\n---\n\n**Regulations on Visualization**\n\nUpon completing the ritual recitations, prostrate before the altar and visualize a crimson *qi* emanating from your heart, ascending to the heavens. After a moment, as if traversing a hundred *li*, the path of crimson *qi* stretches boundlessly, unobstructed by blemish or shadow, lined only with jeweled trees. Suddenly, a yellow path appears—this is the Yellow Path of the Sun and Moon. After crossing five or six *li* beyond it, distant purple clouds loom faintly. Upon reaching the purple clouds, the Gate of Heaven comes into view. The gate spans one *zhang* and eight *chi*, and all attendants halt. Only the Perimeter General, the Direct Envoy, and the Merit Clerk may transmit the memorial. Jade lads bear the memorial to the threshold, where they present it to the west. There, the Orthodox Unity Three Heavens Master, surnamed Zhang and named Daoling, is seen. After bowing, the details of the memorial are fully recited. The Heavenly Master performs nine prostrations, then proceeds to the Phoenix Pavilion Gate to enter. Soon, a jade lad in vermilion robes and a dark cap emerges to receive the memorial. The jade lads take the memorial inside, and after a brief moment, reemerge to escort the petitioner before the Most High. The Most High wears a robe of nine-colored cloud radiance and a crown of ninefold virtue, seated upon the dais with the Two Mystic Perfected Ones attending to his left and right. The Great One, clad in vermilion robes and a dark cap, presents the memorial to the Most High. After a single glance, the Great One, following the Most High’s intent, inscribes \"By the command of the Jade Emperor of the Great Clarity\" and affixes the proper characters. The task complete, another jade lad collects the memorial from the right steps and entrusts it to the Duty Clerk of the day. The petitioner bows in reverence, takes leave of the Most High, and departs. Again, he bows to take leave of the Heavenly Master. Together with the memorial’s divine officials, he rejoices and returns to the place of presentation. Rising, he announces the completion of the ritual.\n\n---\n\n**Auspicious and Inauspicious Days for Petitioning Peace**\n\nFor *Petitioning Peace* memorials and *jiao* rites, the myriad heavens descend, bestowing blessings upon the living—most auspicious.\nFor *Jade Hall* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens rejoice, extending felicity and longevity—most auspicious.\nFor *Golden Hall* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens send down numinous power, prolonging years and increasing destiny—most auspicious.\nFor *Dragon-Tiger* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens do not descend, and blessings are few.\nFor *Sin’s Arrival* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens are vexed, grievances go unaddressed—most inauspicious.\nFor *Reverent Heart* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens rejoice, divine spirits witness and accept, bringing fortune.\nFor *Universal Protection* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens bestow blessings, with abundant felicity.\nFor *Fortune’s Birth* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens assemble in joy—most auspicious.\nFor *Receiving Death* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens record sins, and the host suffers calamity—most inauspicious.\nFor *Sacred Heart* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens assess blessings, prolonging and increasing them—most auspicious.\nFor *Benefiting the Future* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens rejoice, delivering salvation to the myriad people—most auspicious.\nFor *Continuing the Line* memorials and *jiao* rites, the heavens open to prosperity, and prayers for blessings are answered.\n\nThe above auspicious days correspond to the twelve months.

Carry them out separately, then retrieve all major memorials at once, recording them as prescribed. If they are to be burned, do so before the incense burner. If transporting memorials from elsewhere, inscribe, seal, and secure them to prevent exposure to insects, rodents, or bartering for profit—violations contravene the Most High’s decrees. Memorials contain the titles of true officials, the names of spirits and deities, and secret numinous instructions; they must not be defiled. All memorials have original copies, which serve as clear references for verification. Never use old copies. As circumstances and petitions differ, so too do the celestial palaces addressed. Common households must not retain copies of memorials. Violations are punishable by the Five Punishments.\n\n---\n\n**Severing Memorials (From the *Tai Zhen Statutes*)**\n\nIt is stated: \"Respectfully following the documents, your servant [Name], in accordance with the law, cultivates and propagates the *qi* of the Dao, summons true officials, and protects the myriad people. For the memorials presented, those that should be burned but were not, sealed and stored in cabinets, rolled and bundled in accumulation—by law, they may not be scattered. Fearing damage by insects, rodents, dampness, or decay, or the loss of any part, I have always strictly adhered to the statutes and dared not violate the decree. Today, in accordance with the regulations, I sever and offer them accordingly.\"",

Let the assembled officials bear witness, rewarding and aiding those who have rendered service, in accordance with the statutes governing merit and without betraying the trust of efficacy.\n\nI humbly beseech the Most High to discern and heed this plea.\n\nThe number of severed memorials varies, for times differ in abundance and restraint, and the law adapts to action or concealment. When concealed, fewer are required; when enacted, more. The tally is completed upon reaching one hundred memorials for severance. As stated earlier, each year’s severance concludes in the tenth month.\n\n**Memorials and Cases**\nThe case for memorials shall measure two feet four inches in length, one foot two inches in width, and eight inches in height, and must feature curved legs. Nanmu or catalpa wood is preferred. Modern use of tall, straight-legged cases is contrary to the statutes and will result in the forfeiture of one’s allotted years.\n\n**The Heavenly Elder Questions the Three Sovereigns**\nThe Heavenly Elder questioned the Three Sovereigns: “Why are talismans made on *wuxu* days?”\n\nThe Three Sovereigns replied: “*Xu* is the Gate of Heaven. *Wu* is the likeness of the Earth’s Central Office and its Lord. The Heavenly Thearch customarily descends from the Gate of Heaven to wander on *wuxu* days. When talismans are crafted on this day, he rejoices and bestows the fulfillment of wishes. *Wu* pertains to earth; thus, one is certain to attain official rank, be enfeoffed as a marquis, and receive a domain.”\n\nThey are to be worn at the hour of *wu*, for *wu* embodies the essence of the Great Yang and the radiance of pure metal—an emblem of lofty rank and golden-purple eminence.\n\n**Avoidances and Taboos**",

Violations reduce one’s allotted years by twenty-four.\n\nWhen submitting memorials, all members of the household, including fowl and dogs, must not create clamor. Violations incur a penalty of twelve years’ reduction.\n\nMemorials must not be submitted during great winds, heavy rains, or prolonged storms. Violations result in one year of illness.\n\nThose afflicted with the six ailments must not submit memorials on behalf of others. Violations reduce one’s allotted years by thirty-six.\n\nWhen submitting memorials, one must not consume wine, meat, or the five pungent vegetables. Violations reduce one’s allotted years by twelve.\n\n**Prohibitions**\n\nThe Prohibitions state: When submitting memorials in the offices of the Dao to request official appointments, one must not transgress or err. Those defiled by impurity must not enter the ritual space.\n\nThose who have witnessed a burial must not enter rivers, mountains, marshes, or forests. Livestock that have given birth within seven days must not enter the ritual space. Infants under one hundred days old must not enter the ritual space. Livestock that have borne young within a month must not enter the ritual space.\n\nObjects of faith used in memorials and *jiao* rites must not be lent to others. Within the ritual space, one must not burn foul or odorous substances, nor feathers, hides, or horns.\n\nAll who enter the ritual space must do so with reverence and solemnity, performing rites of obeisance. One must not act with arrogance or irreverence.\n\nWithin the ritual space, one must not point or gesture, speak recklessly or unlawfully, or engage in frivolous speech or laughter. One must not expose the body.\n\nOfferings of faith must be distributed among the Daoist faithful.\n\nWhen approaching the ritual space to submit memorials for the salvation of the sick or the alleviation of misfortune, one must don a sash, wear wooden clogs, and bow respectfully, knocking one’s head to the ground while recounting the matter in full. One must not act with arrogance, cruelty, or haughtiness, nor raise one’s voice in self-aggrandizement. Violations are judged under the three penalties.\n\nThe Decrees state: If a father is afflicted with illness or misfortune while his son bears the great register of the Celestial Master, the father must don a cap and hempen robe, knock his head to the ground, and strike his cheeks. Only then may the son enter the ritual space to submit the memorial.\n\nThe Decrees state: If father and son seek to make requests improperly, both father and son are judged under the three penalties. The same applies to brothers.\n\nThe Decrees state: If a woman holds a register of the Dao and her husband faces urgent misfortune, he must don a sash, wear wooden clogs, and bow respectfully according to the rites. Only then may the woman enter the oratory to submit the memorial.\n\nThe Decrees state: If a husband makes a request improperly, he is judged under two penalties. If a wife fails to proclaim the decree clearly, she is judged under three penalties.\n\nThe Decrees state: If an uncle or elder male cousin is afflicted with illness or misfortune while a nephew or younger male cousin bears the register, the latter must submit a memorial as in the case of father and son.\n\nThe Decrees state: If a mother’s brother or sister is afflicted with illness or misfortune, and their children or grandchildren seek to submit a memorial, they must do so as in the case of uncles and nephews.\n\nThe Decrees state: Those who commit heinous acts—wielding the sword to execute, plotting against their lord, or murdering their father—are guilty of great treason. No amount of wealth or merit can atone for such crimes. They shall tread upon the Mountain of Knives, ascend the Forest of Swords, endure the cauldron’s boiling waters, and suffer burning and scalding for ten thousand generations without reprieve, their sins beyond redemption.\n\n**Disciplinary Statutes**\n\nThe Disciplinary Statutes state: Within the human body resides a spirit that records transgressions, ascending and descending with the passing of time, daily noting good and evil.\n\nOne hundred and twenty transgressions form a *ke*, which brings more harm than benefit. One hundred and eighty transgressions form a *hao*, which causes livestock to fail to reproduce. Ten transgressions form a *bian*, which brings illness. Five hundred and forty transgressions form a *xiong*, which harms the fetus and injures children. Seven hundred and twenty transgressions form a *chui*, which brings death. Seven hundred and twenty-nine transgressions form a *yang*, which causes muteness, paralysis, blindness, or deafness. One thousand and eighty transgressions form a *huo*, which brings sudden, premature death. One thousand two hundred transgressions form a *can*, which produces rebellious offspring. One thousand two hundred and sixty transgressions form a *jiu*, which severs the line of descent. One thousand four hundred transgressions form a *ji*, which brings calamity flowing through five generations. One thousand six hundred and twenty transgressions form a *zhe*, which severs the lineage, leaving no descendants. One thousand eight hundred transgressions form a *huan*, which causes the family to produce those afflicted with madness or idiocy. Two thousand and sixty transgressions form a *bao*, which brings violent death by weapons. Two thousand three hundred and thirty transgressions form a *xu*, which causes family members—father and son, brothers—to attack one another. Two thousand five hundred and twenty transgressions form a *zeng*, which brings severe skin diseases to the family. Two thousand seven hundred transgressions form a *hai*, which causes deafness in the family. Two thousand eight hundred transgressions form a *zai*, which brings familial incest, depravity, and rebellion. Three thousand and sixty transgressions form a *yi*, which causes the family to produce the blind, the castrated, or the mutilated. Three thousand one hundred and thirty transgressions form a *bian*, which brings imprisonment, execution, or the extermination of the clan. Three thousand one hundred and fifty transgressions form a *guai*, which causes the family to produce beggars in the marketplace, their bones discarded and abandoned. Three thousand six hundred transgressions form a *man*, which necessitates death.\n\nThe Statutes state: Some die at twenty or thirty, their *ke* filled with misfortune and early death. Others reach fifty or sixty before their *ke* fills with misfortune and early death. Some, though having committed no transgressions in youth, die prematurely—these inherit the residual transgressions of past lives. Others, though committing great evil and treason, live out their years without encountering disaster—they inherit the residual blessings of their ancestors.\n\nThus, the accumulation of virtue leaves residual fortune, while the accumulation of evil leaves residual misfortune. If one can repent of transgressions, they vanish and fortune arises. One must reflect on one’s faults, take responsibility, reform, and never repeat them. Practicing this for ten days removes one *ke* of transgressions from the spirit within. Practicing for one hundred days removes two *ke*. Practicing for one year removes three *ke*. Practicing for three years brings the corresponding fortune.\n\nIf one does not reflect or repent, transgressions deepen daily. Minor transgressions harm only oneself; major transgressions flow down to descendants. Accumulated goodness is like dust upon a beam; accumulated evil is like smoke within a chimney.

      "translated_text": "**Memorial for Drought**\n\nWe humbly submit: According to the sacred writ, we, Your servants, though foolish and unworthy, have encountered this Daoist congregation and been blessed to witness this sagely age. By fortunate coincidence, we have been touched by the Great Law. We prostrate ourselves in gratitude to the Most High, whose vast embrace and merciful compassion of the Master Lords have bestowed upon us grace without the slightest merit of our own. Day and night, we tremble with dread, as though treading upon ice or crossing a ravine, unable to repay even a fraction of the恩 of Heaven and Earth.\n\nOn the day we received the Law, we vowed to serve the Master’s gate with reverence, to disseminate virtue and power, to assist the state and sustain life, to deliver all beings, and to place salvation of the myriad creatures above all else. Yet of late, the cycles of Heaven and Earth have turned adverse; yin and yang clash; the four seasons lose their proper measure. The realm suffers from severe drought; crops fail to ripen. We fear that demonic calamities will arise in succession: pure yang ascends, congealed yin lingers below; the two qi fail to interact; the mysterious moisture does not descend. Scorching winds and blazing sun afflict the people; crops wither and parch; fish in dried ponds dread the daylight.\n\nThis arises because the Son of Heaven, having received the Mandate of Heaven, rules over all domains, yet the Three Talents, the lords and governors, the ministers and local officials have failed to govern with due care, and their administrative achievements fall short. We, Your servants, bear the heavy responsibility of the Dao yet lack the means to propagate its transformative power. Unable to rectify and harmonize the proper sequence of qi, we have caused the Five Phases to lose their balance, inviting the onslaught of celestial disasters.\n\nWe have searched the statutes and laws: the qi of the Dao is vast and all-covering, moistening and nourishing all living beings. We have learned that Qian knows the Great Beginning, and Kun brings things to completion. When Heaven and Earth interact in harmony, all things flourish. Spring gives birth, summer nurtures growth, autumn brings harvest, and winter stores away. When yin and yang are harmonious and compliant, grasses and trees flourish, and the Five Grains ripen. The Great Yin governs rain. On the day of *Lichun*, men sow the fields, and women tend to mulberry and hemp, hoping that by autumn and winter they may provide tribute and taxes, sustaining all life under Heaven and upon Earth.\n\nIn the second month of *Lichun*, the Five Grains begin to be sown. When rainwater is balanced and harmonious, the Five Grains thrive, and harmonious qi accumulates. Yet for some days now, scorching drought has persisted; sweet rain has not fallen. Yang qi waxes excessive; the sky lacks the impulse to send forth clouds; the earth lacks the moisture of vital fluids. We, Your servants, though unworthy, dare not presume, yet in accordance with the statutes and laws of the Heavenly Master, we venture through boiling waters and scorching fires to humbly submit this memorial. With utmost trepidation and fear, we kowtow, acknowledging our capital offense.\n\nWe beseech the Most High, the Boundless Great Dao, the Three Master Lords: You love life and abhor death. We implore You to bestow the transformative power of the Great Dao. May the officials in charge distinguish the Five Phases, regulate the pitch-pipes, array the Eight Trigrams, and mark the months and solar terms, so that yang does not encroach upon its bounds, yin does not retreat from its proper measure. When the Five comes to rest upon the One, Water naturally moistens below; when the Five ascends to the Two, Fire naturally flames upward; when the Five rides upon the Three, Wood naturally bends and straightens; when the Five removes the Four, Metal congeals and transforms; when the Five pairs with itself, the Law nourishes crops. Only when the Five are complete does nothing fail to grow. Then may the *Chunhuo* constellation withdraw its flames, the *Xuanxiao* constellation release its moisture, the *Jisu* constellation pour forth its tongue, the *Bisu* constellation stir its roots. May the coarse stones of the Five Marchmounts and the surging springs of the Four Marshes burst forth.\n\nWe humbly implore Your celestial mercy. We reverently request that from the Lingtai Palace, one Han Ming Lord and one hundred twenty officials and generals be dispatched to command the celestial thunder. From the Yuanming Palace, one Xiao Xuan Ming Lord and one hundred twenty officials and generals be dispatched to command Lord Lü, Son of the River Earl; the Thirty-Six Water Emperors; the Twelve Stream Maidens; the Nine River Water Emperors; the subordinate officials of the River Pacification Marquis; and the Water Deities of the Central Region, to summon clouds and send down rain. From the Hetian Palace, one Jiuhai Beixuan Lord and one hundred twenty officials and generals be dispatched to send forth water qi and release wind and thunder. From the Taishan Palace, the Nine Valley Lords of Sizhou and one hundred twenty officials and generals be dispatched to raise water qi. We further request the Nine Sea Lords and Water Emperors of Sizhou, the Envoys of Floating Clouds, and one hundred ten officials and generals to descend together. May they join with the illustrious Earth Lord of this prefecture, county, and township; the spirits of the famous mountains and great marshes, the source-valleys and rivers; the ancient and present ministers and great officials who have rendered service to the people and are enshrined in temples; and all the Perfected Officials of villages, townships, hamlets, and wards. May they register the qi, transmit the talismans, and govern the temple offices. May all the divine lords descend, unite their hearts and strength, assist the Dao of Heaven, perform their numinous powers, summon clouds and send down rain, bestowing abundant moisture and copious soaking. May the parched seedlings receive the glory of fattening moisture; may the myriad people gain the Mandate of renewal.\n\nWhen the task is accomplished and the affair established, may their merits be reported and their ranks promoted. May the Lords of Wind and Rain likewise ascend to the Three Heavens to receive their due reward. We pray that the Celestial Bureau issue a decree to swiftly cause the drought demons to perish in accordance with this memorial. We specially beseech the Three Masters of the Most High to grant efficacy and verification, that we may not fail in our trust.\n\nMay the Most High, in Your discernment, have mercy upon our foolish inadequacy.\n\nWe respectfully entrust this to the Direct Envoys of the Two Officials, the Left and Right Official Envoys of the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Scribes of Yin-Yang Divine Formulas, the Charioteers of the Red Talisman Statutes, and the Courier Horses of the Strong Winds, two officials each, to carry forth.\n\nWe, Your servants, humbly memorialize on behalf of the parched and desiccated qi of this realm, fearing the failure of the hundred grains. We kowtow and beseech the Celestial Officials to descend in due season, bestowing flowing moisture and abundant soaking.\n\nOne precious memorial is hereby submitted to the Three Celestial Bureaus, awaiting Your decree.\n\nWe, Your servants, with utmost trepidation and fear, kowtow and bow our heads in reverence, submitting this for Your attention.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial to Cease Rain After Receiving Water**\n\n[Position the ritual implements.]\n\nWe humbly submit: According to the sacred writ, we, Your servants, have encountered this turning of the cosmic cycle and been privileged to receive the Master’s Dao, assisting the state and sustaining life. Recently, cold and heat have been unseasonable; demonic afflictions have multiplied. Since the beginning of yang, severe drought has persisted without rain. The people have neglected their agricultural duties; crops wither and parch. We, Your servants, grieve for the people’s distress and have beseeched the descent of clouds and rain. The vast moisture has poured forth in all directions; yin qi has descended without cease. Torrential rains have surged; the hundred rivers overflow. The people have abandoned their livelihoods; fields and seedlings are submerged. The court and the common folk suffer hardship.\n\nWe, Your servants, in accordance with ancient rites, humbly submit this memorial, praying that it may be conveyed above. We beseech that the rains be restrained.",

We have received profound grace, long upheld the master’s Dao, and been bestowed the Celestial Master’s talismans and registers for our own protection. Such favor and radiance are truly excessive.\n\nYet now we face inauspicious calamity: tigers and wolves have entered our borders, devouring living people and harming the six livestock. Their ravages grow daily deeper, with no means to restrain them. We fear that the lives of our household—men and women—may fall into decline and adversity, ensnared in karmic nets, transgressing the manifold prohibitions: the Generals of the Great Year, the Year of Birth, the Life Destiny, the Twelve Taboos, the *fēishī* corpse-qi, the ghosts of drink and food, the mountain spirits and sea numina, the one hundred twenty spectral demons, and all those since the Most Ancient—such as the Generals of Inversion, the Generals of the Way, each invoking their official titles—along with the spirits of harm from the Five Directions and those who obstruct the roads. We beseech that none of these bring us affliction.\n\nWe implore the Northern Mysterious Lord, with one hundred twenty officers and generals, to govern the Black Bureau. We further implore the Northern Pacifying Guardian Lord, with one hundred twenty officers and generals, to govern the Red Bureau. Together may they descend, sealing our dwelling and precincts.

May all sentient beings be swept away. We pray that in our prefecture and county, our household—men and women, young and old—along with our oxen, horses, and six livestock, in all our comings and goings, may not encounter the calamities of tigers, wolves, and manifold disasters. May no poisonous harm cross this border, and may all receive complete protection.\n\nMay the generals, officers, and soldiers who demonstrate their efficacy be rewarded for their merit and labor.

Thus concluded.\n\n**Memorial for the Dissolution of Curses and Hexes**\nDuly inscribed with the proper ritual titles, we humbly address:\n\nIn accordance with the sacred writ, [Name] today declares in person: by a thousand-year fortune, I have been granted the honor of serving the Great Dao. Yet, being of humble and unworthy nature, my faith has often faltered, inviting the accumulation of baleful qi. Of late, my dwelling has been beset by misfortune; dreams assail me in confusion, and omens of ill portend without cease. My limbs grow heavy, my complexion withers, my spirit scatters, no longer bound to my form. Divination and inquiry reveal the presence of wicked persons who, through mutual malediction, invoke heaven and earth, summon ghosts and spirits, and employ a hundred forms of curses. Some inscribe my name, others craft effigies in my likeness; some pierce hearts with blades, others sever hair and fingers, offering them to the spirits of the land. I fear the hundred oath-bound ghosts now seize and detain me. I know not what merit may dissolve this, nor how to guard my life and body. With a sincere heart and offerings of utmost faith, I rely upon the Great Dao, beseeching the celestial ministers to receive my plea. I beg for this memorial to reverse and dissolve the curses.\n\nProstrate, I present this memorial to the Celestial Bureau, praying that the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Venerable One, the Three Master Lords, the Ladies, and the Attendant Scribes of the Gate deign to attend, examine, and act. If the curses and hexes were cast in the spring months of yin, mao, and chen against my person, I invoke the Lords of the Nine Yi of the East, Jia and Yi, to reverse and dissolve them. If cast in the summer months of si, wu, and wei, I invoke the Lords of the Eight Man of the South, Bing and Ding, to reverse and dissolve them. If cast in the autumn months of shen, you, and xu, I invoke the Lords of the Six Rong of the West, Geng and Xin, to reverse and dissolve them. If cast in the winter months of hai, zi, and chou, I invoke the Lords of the Five Di of the North, Ren and Gui, to reverse and dissolve them. If cast in the intercalary months, may the Lords of the Three Qin of the Center, Wu and Ji, dispel and dissolve them. If the curses were cast under the twenty-eight constellations, may the Lords of the corresponding stellar lodges reverse and dissolve them. If wicked persons have crafted effigies or pierced hearts with blades, or if the curses were placed at roadside shrines, altars, prisons, sacred trees, well spirits, hearth deities, or in the domains of the River Earls, water officials, or the private spirits of heretical masters, we humbly note: the Most High is pure and exalted, the Three Heavens vast and distant, the upright qi eternal, while the perverse qi runs rampant, wrongfully harming the innocent—of whom I am but one. I fear that, unjustly ensnared, I may suddenly be claimed by the ghostly officials. I beseech the Great Dao of the Most High, Lord Lao, the Venerable One, the Heavenly Masters, the Lady Masters, the Three Master Lords, the Ladies, the Attendant Scribes, and the True Lords of the Five Qi to attend and consider. If I have transgressed the Five Oaths or the Seven Curses, I implore the million soldiers of the Supreme Prime and the hundred thousand soldiers of the Lords of Reversal to descend as one. For my sake, release the three hun and seven po, that they may not be detained; restore my hun and restrain my po, harmonizing my spirit and qi. Dissolve the thousand evils and ten thousand ghosts within my body, that they may never again disturb me. May all malevolent spirits and curses be utterly swept away.

For [the petitioner], unbind the calamities and peril, and ascend through the Nine Perils of the Celestial Net, presenting one chapter of the *Feidu Jiu’e Tianluo*. It is submitted to the [Petitioner’s] Court with a single summons of stone.\n\nThe *Que Sanzai* chapter is presented in full ritual position, and the memorial states: Thus it is said. Since the [specified] month and day, [the petitioner] has been afflicted with illness and suffering. Thus it is said. Upon the master’s examination, it is found that the year and fate are inauspicious. Within the reckoning of the Nine Palaces and the flying tally of the *yuanchen* calendar, there is a convergence of opposing calculations, now exhausted. Moreover, both public and private matters, disputes and slander, water and fire, tigers and wolves, insects and serpents—all manifold perils—cling to the body. Some are this year’s *jiesha*, others next year’s *zaisha*; some are the *niansha*, *yuesha*, *risha*, or *shisha*, or the *yinchen* killer. There are the Five Directions’ slayers: the Green Slayer of the East, the Red Slayer of the South, the White Slayer of the West, the Black Slayer of the North, and the Yellow Slayer of the Center. One also fears entanglement in the Celestial Net and Earthly Web, dreading sudden harm without escape, causing great and small to tremble in terror, with no recourse.\n\nThus, considering the Nine Perils of the year—first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth—the perils of tigers, wolves, blades, and weapons; the perils of bandits and corvée; the perils of the Three Punishments and Three Slayers—I now invoke the Lord of Deliverance from Peril, the Lord of Life’s Stability, the Lord of Longevity, the Lord of Life’s Augmentation, the Lord of Life’s Continuance, the Lord of Deliverance and Life Extension, and the Lord of Great Fortune and Virtue. Each is accompanied by one hundred twenty officials and generals.\n\nI further invoke the August Heavenly Thearch, the Canopy of Sun and Moon, the Lords of the Northern Dipper, the Three Heavens’ Record-Keeping Lords of Fate, and the Marshal of Deliverance from Peril.

The Orthodox Unity Merit Officer descends to govern the hundred illnesses within the heart. The Illness-Treating Merit Officer descends to govern the hundred illnesses within the spleen. The *Qi*-Directing Merit Officer descends to govern the hundred illnesses within the stomach. The Central Region Merit Officer descends to govern the hundred illnesses within the liver.

The Hook-Riding Lord descends to govern the hundred illnesses within the lower abdomen. The Three Officials’ Archers descend to govern the hundred illnesses within the back and spine. The Celestial Armored Soldiers descend to govern the hundred illnesses within the twenty fingers. The Celestial *Ding* Warriors descend to govern the hundred illnesses within the head and brain.\n\nMay all these maladies be eradicated and cured.\n\nGeneral Wang Wenqing of *Jiazi*, leading thirty-six thousand soldiers, stands guard to the left and right, defending until *you*.

Humbly approaching this minister, I beseech a memorial be presented to the Three Celestial Bureaus, praying for deliverance and redemption.\n\nFor some ten days now, cold and heat have been unbalanced, the pores disordered.

With special reverence, I beseech the Most High and Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Lords and Venerable Ones, the Celestial Master Lord, the Three Master Lords, the Lady, the Compassionate Father, and the Holy Mother—to bestow grace and mindfulness, granting the Dao’s qi to shield and respond to this disciple’s body.\n\nRespectfully, I petition the Celestial Bureau, presenting to the Heavenly Physicians and the Twelve Lords of the Grand Physicians, that they descend to this disciple’s body and, wherever the illness resides, administer healing.

In this year’s celestial cycle, the Five Poisons spread unchecked, afflicting the people of heaven without regard for the virtuous or the base.\n\nWe, born of the womb in ignorance, descendants of the lower officials, have by a thousand generations’ fortune been granted the grace to serve the Great Dao. Yet we remain ever fearful, finding no ground upon which to rest secure. Recently, our household—elders and children alike—has dwelt within this troubled abode, unable to safeguard ourselves, our anxieties deepening.\n\nIn recent years, we may have undertaken repairs, excavations, or renovations—moving fences, replacing pillars—matters of no single kind, yet all risking transgression against the celestial prohibitions and earthly taboos: the Generals of the Great Sun and the Grand Year-Star, the spirits of heads and feet, the *qi* of one’s ruling year and life destiny, the Great and Lesser Depletions, the baleful stars of calamity and misfortune, the Hooking Chen and White Tiger, the spirits of the twelve hours, the earthly numina and earthly slayers, all manner of depletions, and the officials of the upper and lower earth. We fear such offenses have caused the spirits of our dwelling to grow restless, and the dragon deities presiding over our well and hearth to withhold their favor. We pray that our household may be granted stability, our dwelling prosper, and all within find peace.\n\nInvoking the *Petition of the Twelve Hundred Officials of the Celestial Master*, we reverently beseech the descent of one hundred twenty divine lords, generals, and officials, led by the *Qingyi* Great Masters, to absolve our household of all past and present transgressions and to dissolve them entirely. We humbly entreat the Five Lords of the Earth and their one hundred twenty officials to dispel the Generals of the Grand Year-Star, Great Yin, and Great Sun; the Great and Lesser Depletions; the spirits of silkworm chambers and livestock; and all ghosts bound by upper and lower prohibitions—may they be utterly eradicated.\n\nWe reverently summon:\n- The Nine Lords of the Eastern Yi, under the Azure Emperor,\n- The Eight Lords of the Southern Man, under the Vermilion Emperor,\n- The Six Lords of the Western Rong, under the White Emperor,\n- The Five Lords of the Northern Di, under the Black Emperor,\n- The Three Lords of the Central Qin, under the Yellow Emperor,\n\nalong with the *qi* of the four seasons and the five earths, mutually dividing their influences, and the officials and generals of the four directions. May they descend to our dwelling to purge all prohibitions, the thousand spirits and ten thousand demons, the lingering *qi* of the lower officials, and the baleful ghosts of years, months, days, and hours—all calamities, ruptures, and harms—may they be utterly dissolved.\n\nMay the Five Emperors pacify this dwelling, and may no misfortunes arise. May blessings and protection abide through the year, the four seasons pass in tranquility, the eight solar terms remain free of disaster, and the twenty-four *qi* nodes align in harmony. May Heaven above broadly cover, and Earth below universally bear, that we may forever enjoy steadfast fortune.\n\n- The Azure Dragon of *Zhen* governs the left of the dwelling,\n- The Vermilion Dragon of *Li* governs the front,\n- The White Dragon of *Dui* governs the right,\n- The Black Dragon of *Kan* governs the rear,\n- The Yellow Dragon of *Kun* guards the center.\n\nMay the Five Dragons govern this dwelling, repelling all inauspiciousness, dissolving all malevolence, and sweeping away a thousand woes.

I have petitioned the officials, seeking this scroll for deliverance. Due to my limited learning, I do not grasp the **qi** and seasons, nor possess refined numerology. I rely solely on the **Six Jia** and **Five Phases** to determine cycles and fate.*\n\n*By tradition, the **Steel-Hai** direction (absolute **yang**) is the **Heavenly Net**, while the **Chen-Si** direction (absolute **yin**) is the **Earthly Snare**. When one’s fate aligns with these, disaster follows. For men, if their **birth year** clashes with the **Tàisuì** (Yearly Official), their **birth month** becomes the **Heavenly Net’s transmission**, and their **conception month** the **Earthly Snare**. For women, if their **birth year** clashes with the **current year**, their **conception month** becomes the **Heavenly Net’s River Chief**, and their **birth month** the **Earthly Snare**. Additionally, if the **current year** clashes with their **birth year’s Tàisuì**, their **conception month** becomes the **Heavenly Net’s transmission**, and their **birth month** the **Earthly Snare**. Further, when the **Heavenly Halter** aligns with **Tàiyī**, it becomes the **Heavenly Net**. If the fetus resides in **Dēngmíng**, it becomes the **Earthly Halter**. Months of **Five Punishments, Six Calamities, Seven Injuries, and Nine Afflictions**, as well as years and months of decline, or when **Halter and Chief** clash in lethal combinations—these bring myriad disasters and misfortunes, causing untold harm.*\n\n*I fear my household’s fate may collide with the **Five Directions’ Nets**, the **Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams**, their mutual assaults, or the **Nine Heavens’ Primordial Qi** descending into the mortal realm, spanning **Nine Hundred and Ninety Li** in all directions.

      "translated_text": "Burials in foreign graves, they allege the wrong earthly domain.\n\nViolations of taboos, they allege offending the sacred positions of the spirits.\n\nUnstable burials, they allege the disturbance of earthly *qi*.\n\nDisputes over high and low or four-directional graves, each alleges their proper placement, yet demands further relocation.\n\nDisputes among the six relatives and nine clans, each alleges their living kin betrayed the bonds of kinship and virtue.\n\nCases of nurturing children yet failing to raise them, they allege that Heaven’s nature permits endurance of suffering, yet they cannot fully mature.\n\nDisputes with same-surname kin, they allege the absence of compassionate rites.\n\nDisputes with different-surname kin, they allege mutual scorn and reckless transgression.\n\nCases of the homeless dead, they allege no proper resting place.\n\nCases of those without descendants, they allege the extinction of ancestral sacrifices.\n\nDisputes from resentment, they allege their *zhìqi* not being fulfilled.\n\nDisputes from blame and anger, they allege others encroaching upon them.\n\nDisputes from grief, they allege excessive misfortune and wrongs.\n\nDisputes from sudden death, they allege no chance to speak.\n\nAgain, during life, any grudges or feuds with others, each has its own disputes, all arising from lingering resentments—none can be traced or recalled—yet they summon the deceased’s descendants, and all disputes stem from the inability to endure suffering, demanding retribution from the living.\n\nThough broadly encompassing the eighty-one disputes, their branches and leaves scatter, multiplying into myriad cases.\n\nThere are also those who, in life, committed offenses and, in death, suffer punishments—boiled in hot water, scorched by fire, cut by windblades, dissolved by lightning, burdened with stones, crushed in mountains, dredging rivers, blocking seas—such calamities, numbering countless thousands, all drag their descendants into litigation, passing blame through generations.\n\nFurther, there are hidden grudges and concealed resentments, festering sores and suppressed hatreds, which erupt in thoughts and words, spawning disputes both seen and unseen.\n\nSome, in times when justice is not upheld, face dire straits, unable to bear their sorrow, their hearts heavy with grief and tongues bitter with curses. They utter harsh complaints, invoke Heaven and Earth, defame the luminous and sacred, revile the gods and spirits, and their grievances reach the Underworld, all becoming grounds for litigation.\n\nOr those who, in life, committed heinous crimes, built no virtuous deeds, and violated all laws and prohibitions—all such cases are entered into the records of judgment.\n\nA hundred years, fifty years, thirty years, twenty years, ten years, one year, one month, one day, one hour—accumulated punishments add up, and all these judgments combine. After death, the remaining punishments do not cease; they cling and accumulate, endlessly across generations.\n\nThe tormented soul, restless and anguished, grows ever harder to bear, unable to endure suffering. They implore the ghostly officials to summon their living kin, demanding they face their agonies instead.\n\nThough the Underworld’s judgments are clear, there are still those who twist and pervert justice. Some can hear the ghosts’ pleas and issue summons, causing a family to suffer endless illnesses and calamities year after year, strange omens in dreams, dwindling wealth, with no way to avert disaster.\n\nThe petitioner humbly begs the celestial master of the dark realm to review the edicts and records, and only the urgent matter of resolving grave disputes and burial records should be addressed. The petitioner, though distant from the sacred and revered, and though the paths may have strayed and been lost, seeks to clarify the source of their suffering with utmost sincerity. They follow the rites of the thousand-two-hundred officials, and the true methods taught by the One True Person to the Southern Peak Wei Lady for healing and pacifying spirits, to request on behalf of the family:\n\n- That the Heavenly Official Lord dispatch five officers, each with a hundred and twenty soldiers,\n- And that the Left and Right Marshals of the Underworld be summoned, each with a hundred and twenty soldiers, to oversee the Great Bright Palace.\n\nThe petitioner further requests the Generals of Protection and their soldiers, along with the Heavenly Official’s true talismans, to seize and disperse all the ghosts tied to grave disputes and burial records, as well as those causing hidden harm. They shall then issue a proclamation to the family, using their original names and surnames, to:\n\n- Confront the god of grave disputes and burial records under the jurisdiction of the Gōngmáng (勾芒) deity,\n- Summon the god of grave disputes and burial records under the jurisdiction of the Zhūróng (祝融) deity,\n- Invoke the god of grave disputes and burial records under the jurisdiction of the Bóshōu (薄收) deity,\n- Call upon the god of grave disputes and burial records under the jurisdiction of the Xuánmíng (玄冥) deity,\n- And appeal to the god of grave disputes and burial records under the jurisdiction of the Gōuchén (勾陈) deity.",

      "translated_text": "**Memorial on Behalf of a Grave Illness and Great Calamity**\n*(Gold-Purple Substitute Form Tablet)*\n\n**The Petitioner humbly states:**\nIn strict accordance with the official documents and titles, a certain individual, born in the year [X], month [Y], day [Z], having reached the age of [W], now residing in [State]-[County]-[Village]-[Precinct], respectfully submits this Gold-Purple Substitute Form Tablet.\n\nFrom childhood to this day, this petitioner has been without virtue or merit, yet has been graced with heavy honors and emoluments. As years have passed, his offenses have grown deeper. Though his duty lies in nurturing the people and his governance in soothing the customs, he has at times been swayed by private affections, favoring the near over the public, or recklessly meted out punishments, incurring the wrath of the True Sage. Even minor transgressions have led to grave consequences, and he has long feared the retribution of the Underworld, yet remained unaware.\n\nSince [month], this petitioner has suffered calamities and illnesses beyond measure. He humbly trusts that the **Supreme Dao/Way** secretly grants reprieve—where there is sincerity, there is response—and thus dares to lay bare his plea, awaiting Your merciful inspection.\n\nIn strict observance of the rites, this petitioner presents:\n- A golden effigy (*jinren*) of his form,\n- Purple silk (*zǐwén*) of [X] *zhang*,\n- Rice: one *shi* two *dou* (by age),\n- *Zhen* coins: one thousand two hundred,\n- Oil: one *dou* two *sheng*,\n- Paper: one hundred twenty sheets,\n- Brushes: two,\n- Ink: two *qīng* (ink sticks),\n- Green silk thread: one hundred twenty *zhang*,\n- *Suànzi* (divination rods): one hundred twenty,\n- A clean cloth: one,\nas **verifiable tokens** to be offered to the **Supreme Dao/Way**, beseeching the granting of this memorial, the erasure of his name from the dead registry, and his inscription into the living ledger.\n\nThis petitioner, in accordance with the Master’s teachings and examining the celestial charts, notes that his birth was recorded in the Nine Heavens, adorned with the Five Constant Virtues (*wǔcháng*). His fate is ensnared within the Nine Palaces, entangled by the Eight Trigrams, illuminated by the Three Luminaries, and sustained by the Seven Celestial Deities. Under the canopy of Heaven and Earth, the Five *Qi* nurture his form, while Yin and Yang foster his life. His destiny is as vast as the cosmos, mirroring the laws of Heaven and Earth, inscribed in the **Central Register of the Middle Element**, overseen by the **Lord of Fate** and the **Master of Records**. The **Great Unity** verifies his years, the **Mysterious Symbols** are inscribed, and his name resides within the **Southern Palace of Nanchang**, the **Purple Orchid Chamber**, enshrined in the **Jade Ledger of Seven Treasures**. He has aligned with Heaven and Earth, drawn the breath of the Mysterious Celestial, and his fate was sealed in the Underworld—yet originally, there was no premature death. Now, however, his worldly fortune has waned: the Three Elements converge in mourning, his true *qi* ascends, and the Six Heavens resound with drumbeats. A thousand malevolent spirits and ten thousand demons harm the living, leaving justice unexalted and wrongs unredressed. The **Three Corpses** and wandering souls soar through the heavens, while vengeful ghosts wail, accusing the Three Officials. Though Heaven is high and the Underworld distant, their pleas are unheeded, and their suffering extends to the living. Even his ancestors, both internal and external, have been harmed, their essences disrupted, leading to calamity.\n\nThis petitioner, referencing the **Nine Methods of the Celestial Master** and the *Yuanchen Bao Gou Command Decisions*, knows that human life, whether born under auspicious or inauspicious stars, has a predetermined span—whether long or short, marked by years, months, days, and hours. If one is born under auspicious virtue, they shall long enjoy the Five Blessings; if they encounter punishments or harm, they shall meet the Six Extremities.\n\nUpon investigation, this petitioner’s native star is **[X]**, his given name **[Y]**, and as a ghost, he has endured [Z] years of calamity and suffering.\n\nIt is heard that the **Supreme Dao/Way** is universally compassionate, favoring life and abhorring death, rescuing from all disasters and dissolving all calamities. Those born must live, and those who have perished must be restored. Out of pity for his family and mercy for his suffering, this petitioner, though unworthy of his official duties and charged with proclaiming benevolent governance, dares to lay bare this humble plea before the **Supreme Without-Extremity Dao/Way**, the **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao**, the **Honored Lords and Masters**, the **Celestial Master and Female Teacher**, and the **Three Teachers and All Revered Ones**, beseeching them to extend great mercy, grant a special pardon, and absolve this petitioner of his past transgressions and myriad sins. May the **Dao/Way’s vital breath** envelop him, restoring the nurturing grace of life, saving all beings, and granting him prolonged vitality, entering the realm of **Blessings and Virtue**. May the **Superior Officials of the Upper Registry** inspect his fate, dissect his years, his birth month and conception day, his past and present calamities, and harmonize all malevolent influences, thus petitioning on his behalf:\n\nTo the **Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns**, the **Long-Life Marshal**, and the **Substitute Form Degree-Commissioner**, along with the **Southern Palace Marshal** and **Supervisors of Birth**—each thirty-two in number—riding **Flying Dragons and Feathered Chariots**, and the **Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns**, with armies and officials numbering nine hundred million each, all converging to present this petitioner’s **golden effigy and purple silk**, ascending to the **Thirty-Two Heavens**, traversing the stars to verify his宿命 (*host-fate*), within the **Celestial Registrar’s Hall**, exchanging his name and form. Further, this petitioner requests that the **True Gods and Primordial Vital Breath** descend into his body, re-inscribing his name in the living ledger and extending his life without end.\n\nAdditionally, this petitioner requests:\n- The **Five Lords of Extended Lifespan** and **One Hundred Twenty Officials**, converging to present the **golden effigy and purple silk tokens**, ascending to the **Pure Clarity Primordial Vital Breath Palace**, humbly petitioning the **Star-Degree Commissioner**, the **Name-Exchange Form Commissioner**, and the **Death-to-Life Commissioner**. Further, the **Functional Registrar Officials** and the **Great Yin Summoning and Reviewing Commissioner** shall present the **golden effigy and purple silk**, descending to the **Northern Dipper Great Yin Consort’s First Layer of the Underworld**, within the **Great Yin’s Dead Registry Vault**, exchanging this petitioner’s name and form, inscribing his living name in the **Jade Calendar of the Living Ledger**, and extending his life without limit.\n\nMoreover, this petitioner requests:\n- **[Illegible] Lords**, five in number, with one hundred twenty officials each,\n- The **Five Sovereigns of Ten Thousand Blessings and Disaster Relief**, with one hundred twenty officials each,\n- The **Three Heavenly Lords of Calamity Relief** and the **Five Lords of Harm Relief**, converging to dissolve the **year, month, day, and hour** of this petitioner’s birth that clash with the **Five Stars and Twenty-Eight Constellations**, as well as the **Malevolent Host** and **Evil Constellations**. May the **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper** erase his name from the dead registry, may **Acquisition and Mars** sever his fate of death, may **Luck and Uprightness** exchange his form of death, may **Literature and Martial** remove his name from the dead records, and may the **Heavenly Ropes and Broken Army** spare him from lethal *qi*.\n\nMay the **Three High Tribunals** relieve this petitioner of the **Six Calamities** of his lifespan—**excessive punishment, disease, death, and mourning**, the calamities of **years, months, days, and hours**, the calamities of **Heaven and Earth**, of **prisons**, of **bandits and war**, and of the **Four Seasons and Five Phases (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth)**—and may all **thousand malevolences and ten thousand calamities** be absolved and transcended.",

      "translated_text": "「The Dao/Way knows no prohibitions or taboos; without sincerity and devotion, it cannot be attained. To avert calamities and repel misfortunes, they have come to inform me, seeking official documents. I humbly submit this request, hoping that the Way’s *qi* may flow downward.\n\nI respectfully petition the Heavenly Hall Lord, requesting a hundred and twenty officials, to govern the An Yang Palace, overseeing the removal of the Nine Heavenly Prohibitions. The one receiving the commission shall eliminate [them]. I further request the Heavenly King and his Thousand Two Hundred Immortal Maidens, clad in green robes, to collect the ten thousand people of the world, bestowing upon them titles and seals of gold and silver, granting them divine understanding, averting calamities and repelling misfortunes, and ensuring their lives span a hundred years. If, on the day I receive my appointment, the time should be Five Li, any malevolent spirits and myriad harms shall all be eliminated. I beg the High Official to dispatch the requested personnel accordingly.\n\nWithin my jurisdiction, there are so many officials—two hundred and forty in total. If it be a prefecture, there are twenty-four officials. If a commandery, eighteen officials. If a county, seven officials. All united in strength, they shall help me avert and repel evil, eliminate prohibitions, and ensure no other matters arise in office. Discussions and judgments shall be in harmony with virtue, officials and commoners alike shall rejoice, and thus I may be promoted in time, ending the year in stability.\n\nOn the day my wishes are fulfilled, the petitioned Heavenly Officials shall speak of my merits and labor, not betraying their trust in me. The favor is bestowed by the Supreme Sovereign.\n\nI beg for mercy. Request for Promotion to High Office\n\nWith proper rank, I submit: In accordance with the official documents, I have always been one born from the womb of flesh, with descendants of mere bones. Formerly, through the *Lèhuà* ritual, I was entrusted with the Way to preserve and govern myself. The grace bestowed upon me has been profound and generous, filling me with joy and comfort.\n\nDescended from a noble lineage, my family has long held officialdom as its profession. I have accumulated ranks as various officials, managing royal affairs with distinction, my name and reputation both flourishing. Now I return to this post, which is not something a mere mortal can achieve. I am deeply moved by the Way’s vast protection and care.\n\nMy current office holds the critical affairs of state, or perhaps lies beyond the frontiers, as the case may be. My duties encompass the grand governance of all under Heaven, where both officials and ministers are powerful, and the commoners, accustomed to their privileges, are all too familiar with deceit. There are many lawsuits, and justice is hard to discern. I fear that if my words or actions falter, I may incur blame and censure, and thus I humbly rely on the Way’s broad acceptance and supplication, seeking these officials to safeguard and protect me.\n\nThough unworthy, I bear great responsibility and cannot bear the burden of the mortals’ petitions. I dare to violate the solemnity of the court, humbly presenting this memorial, and hope for Your compassionate grace and protection.\n\nI earnestly request the Twelve Lords of the Nine Barbarians, Eight Man, Six Rong, and Five Di—each twelve in number—along with their officials, soldiers, and attendants, to encircle my residence, standing guard at my sides.\n\nI further petition the Five Lords of Ten Thousand Blessings, each with a hundred and twenty officials, to dispel lingering malevolent *qi* and vengeful spirits, to curse those who seek to harm me, and to repel death and bring life, to repel misfortune and bring blessings.\n\nI further petition the Five Lords of Great Stars, each with a hundred and twenty officials, to govern the Stone Immortal Palace, and to suppress the slanderous tongues of the commoners, so that false accusations cannot take root, and to restore them to their proper places, ensuring that commoners and officials alike meet with smiles and joy.\n\nI further petition the Lords of Auxiliary Generals and Ten Thousand Blessings, each with a hundred and twenty officials, to guard my person.\n\nI further petition the Lord of Azure Darkness, with a hundred and twenty officials, to govern the Great Gate Palace, suppressing the resentment, complaints, and malevolent *qi* of the office, preventing them from reaching me.\n\nI hope that when the Heavenly Officials arrive, their single attendant shall gather with the officials and commoners of my state, commandery, county, village, and hamlet, each following their respective lord, to surround and protect my person. They shall dispel evil spirits, pestilence, and epidemic *qi*, and any schemes of enticement and harm shall all be eliminated, allowing my heart to open and my mind to clear. I shall comprehend the wisdom of the Five Spirits, fully understand what is spoken, and act accordingly. My words shall be as trustworthy as those of a thousand mouths, my intentions as sincere as the deepest vows. My household shall be ever peaceful, and by year’s end, I shall achieve prosperity, benefiting both the public and private spheres, as proof of my devotion.\n\nOn that day, I shall speak of the merits of the Heavenly Officials, requesting their promotion, to repay their labor and suffering. I beg for forgiveness of all my great and small faults, my myriad sins. The favor is bestowed by the Supreme Sovereign.\n\nI further beg for mercy.」",

In strict accordance with the official records, I, [Name], by birth a mortal of flesh and blood, a descendant of lowly officials, through the fortune of fate and the grace of the Great Transformation, have received the benevolent coverage of Heaven’s favor, truly filling me with joy and gratitude.\n\nYet, due to my own stubborn ignorance and accumulated sins—mountains high—disasters and calamities have continually befallen me.\n\nNow, the journey is long and arduous, traversing rivers and mountains, passing through Huai and Si, advancing toward the enemy’s strongholds. In the midst of white blades and poisoned steel, the clash of arms is fierce, and both civil and martial authorities press down upon me. The military laws are severe, execution swift, and those who wield power cruelly oppress others, forcing them into violence. My merits are meager, and I cannot avert misfortune.\n\nFearful that I may perish in this dire strait without escape, I rely upon the **Dao-qi** of the myriad people, humbly presenting this memorial to the **Treaty-Officer**, beseeching protection.\n\nWith deepest reverence, I prostrate myself and submit this petition, appealing to the **Nine Lords of the Eastern Barbarians**, the **Eight Lords of the Southern Snares**, the **Six Lords of the Western Steppe**, and the **Five Lords of the Northern Di**, twelve each in number. I further implore the **Thousand-Li Lord**, the **Ten-Thousand-Li General**, and the **General of Auspicious Protection**, that they may jointly guard and shield me, following and covering me wherever I may be, ensuring my constant safety.\n\nMay they repel all calamities—epidemics, malevolent spirits, and bandits—that I may escape the blades of war, transcend this peril, and find favor within the ranks, free from blame or censure, as proof of my sincerity.\n\nI shall then speak of my merits before the **Temporal Lords and officials**, repaying their labor and toil.\n\nThe grace is granted by the Most High and All-Venerable Celestial Worthies.\n\nI further beg for mercy.\n\n**Chapter of the Vermilion Pine Child**, Volume Six, concludes.",
