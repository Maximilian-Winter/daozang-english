  "full_translation": "**The *Rain-Yang Qi-Climate* (雨旸气候亲机)**\n\n**Title:** *Rain-Yang Qi-Climate* (雨旸气候亲机)\n**Author:** Unknown\n**Volume:** One scroll\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), Canonical Section (正一部)\n\n---\n\n**The *Rain-Yang Qi-Climate* (雨旸气候亲机)**\n\n**The Sun (太阳)**\nBefore the sun rises, first observe the morning *qi* (氣) at the eastern point where the sun emerges—this confirms its presence. If black clouds resemble a chicken egg or a flag-shaped mountain, with *zhènwū* (阵乌) hanging like a banner, and patterns of dragons, snakes, fish, or *lingzhī* (灵芝) and *mǔdān* (牡丹), then thunderstorms will occur on that day between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours.\n\nIf violet-black clouds pierce or surround the sun, or appear above and below it, thunderstorms will strike on that day. If black clouds resemble fish scales, there will be wind, but thunderstorms will only occur three days later. The *Rain-Yang Qi-Climate* (雨旸气候) is thus verified.\n\n**The Moon (太阴)**\nWhen the moon’s color is red, it portends great thunderstorms the next day. If it is greenish-red, the next day will have a bright, round luminous formation, like a chariot wheel. If the moon’s color is white and serene, there will be no thunderstorms the next day.\n\nWhen the moon is accompanied by white clouds forming a round luminous shape, not very distinct, and the day is windy, the thunderstorms will occur three days later. All other cloud formations are the same.\n\n**The *Tianqiang* (天罡) Stars**\nIf the *Tianqiang* (天罡) stars appear in two red hues and shake, thunderstorms will strike. If they appear in green and shake, there will be great calamity the next day. If white clouds rise above the stars, there will be great thunderstorms the next day.\n\nIf yellow clouds rise above the stars and *qi* (氣) penetrates the *Wénqǔ* (文曲) stars, there will be thunderstorms. If the clouds envelop the stars or white clouds emerge from the *dòu* (斗) constellation, thunderstorms will strike the next day, especially around the *wèishí* (未时) hour.\n\nIf the *qi* (氣) is calm and white, there will be no thunderstorms the next day.\n\n**The Big Dipper (北斗)**\nIf white clouds obscure the Big Dipper, there will be great turmoil the next day, especially between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours. If clouds appear above and below the Dipper, resembling fish scales, there will also be great turmoil the next day.\n\nIf white clouds envelop two or three stars of the Big Dipper, thunderstorms will strike the next day. If clouds within the Dipper resemble rippling water and are white, there will be strong winds the next day. If clouds appear like scattered fluff within the Dipper, there will only be wind.\n\nIf black clouds gather below the Dipper and surge upward, wind and rain will arise that very night. If violet-black *qi* (氣) appears below the Dipper or at its mouth, thunderstorms will strike three days later. If the *qi* (氣) is green, it corresponds to the *Wood* (木) day; if red, it corresponds to the *Fire* (火) day. For all other days, the cloud patterns are the same.\n\nIf yellow clouds pass through the Dipper, heavy rain will occur within three days. If white *qi* (氣) clouds pass through the Dipper, rain will also occur within three days. If black *qi* (氣) clouds pass through the Dipper, wind and rain will strike immediately. If lightning appears below the Dipper and extends across it or its mouth, rain will fall that very night.\n\n**The *Longqi* (龙炁) Qi**\nAt dawn, observe the eastern horizon for five-colored *qi* (氣) like threads extending westward—this day will have wind and rain, stirring clouds and mist. If the *qi* (氣) remains suspended in the midheaven without moving, thunderstorms will occur three days later.\n\nIn the evening, as the sun sets, if five-colored *qi* (氣) appears and extends eastward, thunderstorms will strike three days later.\n\n**The White Tiger (白虎)**\nAt dawn, if white *qi* (氣) appears in the east, not far from the sun, it emerges from the *yín* (寅) hour and follows the sun until the *shēn-yǐshí* (申巳) hours. Then, between the *yǒushí* (酉) and *xūshí* (戌) hours, thunderstorms will strike.\n\n**The *Héqi* (河炁) Qi**\nIf large black clouds form in blocks, there will be wind. If their shape resembles a pig, or if black clouds appear like rotting fluff, dried wood, or mist, or if they obscure the moon or appear above it, thunderstorms will strike the next day.\n\nIf white clouds appear like cotton fluff, there will be light rain. If clouds resemble fish scales and move from south to north, there will be southern winds the next day. If they move toward other directions, the same applies after sunset—verify accordingly.\n\n**The Thunder Seal (雷牌)**\nAt dawn, observe the southern horizon for the highest black clouds—this is called the *Thunder Seal* (雷信). If they rise until the *yǐ-wǔshí* (巳午) hours and then disperse in the midheaven, thunderstorms will strike between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours in the eastern direction.\n\nIf the clouds are high in the south, thunderstorms will strike in the east. For all other directions, the pattern is the same.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* emerges from the *Shénxiāo* (神霄) and issues commands, it will appear around the *yǒushí* (酉) hour, bringing violent winds, thunder, and torrential rain, along with flying sand that uproots trees.\n\nIf the *Qīn* (钦火) *Fire* descends to the *Water Palace* (水府) and unfurls flags to issue commands, appearing between the *shēn-yǒushí* (申酉) hours, it will strike that night around the *zǐshí* (子时) hour, causing thunderstorms and flooding the next day, with waves surging on land.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* emerges at sunrise, with black clouds resembling a chicken’s head or flag-shaped mountains, and patterns of *zhènwū* (阵乌), dragons, snakes, fish, *lingzhī* (灵芝), and *mǔdān* (牡丹), thunderstorms will strike between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours.\n\nIf the clouds resemble fish scales, there will only be wind. If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* rides the *Chōng* (冲) star and emerges between the *yǐ-wǔshí* (巳午) hours, thunderstorms will strike around the *wèishí* (未时) hour. If it appears around the *wèishí* (未时) hour, thunderstorms will strike between the *shēn-yǒushí* (申酉) hours.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* meets the *Jīntǔ* (金虎) *Golden Tiger* and issues commands with thunderous intent, the next day between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours will bring violent winds and thunderstorms, slaughtering humans and livestock, destroying temples, plunging the sky into darkness and the earth into chaos, and causing flying sand that uproots trees.\n\nIf it obscures the sun without dispersing, thunderstorms will strike that very day. If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* meets the *Jīntǔ* (金虎) *Golden Tiger* and issues commands, it will appear between the *yǐ-wǔshí* (巳午) hours, striking around the *wǔshí* (午时) hour, or emerge between the *shēn-yǒushí* (申酉) hours, bringing sudden violent winds and thunderstorms.\n\nIf it emerges from the *Gàn* (乾) direction, there will be slaughter and destruction. If it enters the *Xùn* (巽), *Gèn* (艮), or *Kūn* (坤) directions, there will be no calamity. If it enters the *Kǎn* (坎) direction, thunder, lightning, and rain will be dire. If it enters the *Lí* (离) or *Duì* (兑) directions, the outcome will be favorable.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* issues commands, thunderstorms will strike between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours, causing waves to surge on land.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* meets the *White Tiger* (白虎) and issues commands, the next day—especially around the *shēnshí* (申时) hour—will bring thunderstorms.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* meets the *Thunderous Wrath* (雷霆) and issues a great calamity, known as the *Red Rooster and Purple Goose* (赤鸡紫鹅), thunder and lightning will strike before the *wèishí* (未时) hour, toppling trees and slaughtering people, with torrential rain pouring down.\n\nIf the *Thunder* (雷) *Deva* transforms water, thunder and lightning will strike suddenly, bringing torrential rain. If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* summons the *Thunderous Wrath* (雷霆) and all its calamities to obey, between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours, violent winds will carry flying sand and stones, thunder and lightning will strike, torrential rain will fall, temples will be destroyed, trees uprooted, and the sky darkened while the earth grows black.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* dispatches the *Golden Tiger* (金虎) to issue commands, and the sun has a halo (*yùn* 晕) with clouds shaped like dragons or snakes, thunderstorms will strike within three days, especially in the southeast, where temples will be destroyed and evil people slaughtered.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* and the *Great Unity* (太乙) meet and issue commands, appearing that day, the next day will bring violent winds and thunderstorms, slaughtering people and destroying temples, uprooting trees.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* lingers in its abode, appearing in segments or like a fabric curtain thousands to tens of thousands of *zhang* (丈) away, there will be severe drought and violent winds. If the sun is obscured afterward, thunderstorms will strike between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours. If it obscures the sun and clouds extend toward the *Xùn* (巽) direction, there will be attacks on people and destruction of *jīng* (精).\n\nIf dark clouds appear and advance, also known as the *Red Rat* (赤鼠) *surrounding the City* (游城), within five to six days, there will be turmoil in the south. If the *Milky Way* (天河) remains cloudless that night during prolonged drought, it is an extreme omen—no prayers can avert it; this is the *Heaven’s decree* (天数).\n\nThe **Golden Fire** (金火) *Great Killing* (大杀) *Battle* (会战) occurs at *wèishí* (未时), when thunderstorms rage, great tremors strike, demons are slain, trees are broken by violent winds, and heavy snow falls in winter—though the sky is clear, thunder resounds.\n\nWhen the **North Dipper** (北斗) *Celestial Minister of Waters* (都水使者) ventures forth, fierce winds and rains sweep across, flooding and flowing everywhere. If the **North Dipper** (北斗) is near, or the **Milky Way** (天河) is close, the effects will manifest within two *gēng* (更) periods before or after.\n\nThe **Nine Dippers** (九斗) *Yang Radiance* (阳芒) and the *Fire Bell General* (火铃将军) casting fire, aligning with the *Red Rat* (赤鼠), within five to six days of the *rénzǐ* (壬子) to *dīngwù* (丁巳) cycle in the fifth to seventh months, if such *qi* (炁) clouds appear, drought will follow—prayers will be futile, and locusts will swarm.\n\nThe *Heavenly Vitality* (乾精) *Great Calamity* (大煞) of the *Black Dragon* (黑龙), like clouds, with fish moving in pairs across the *Xùn* (巽) direction, will bring violent winds and rains within three days, thunderclaps and lightning strikes, slaying demons and beasts, and punishing wicked men.\n\nWhen winter snow falls, the *Thunder God* (雷神) roams the *shēn-yǒu-xū-hài-zǐ-chǒu* (申酉戌亥子丑) directions, summoning the *Shuāng Wind* (朔风) and great snow. If omens appear in all four directions, thunder and lightning will follow.\n\nWhen *Xīn Jūn* (辛君) ventures forth, the *Golden Tiger* (金虎) brings a *Great Calamity* (大煞), clearing the skies in all directions. Yet suddenly, black clouds arise like dragons and snakes, or obscuring the moon. On the following day, during *wèishí* (未时) to *shēnshí* (申时), thunderstorms will strike.\n\nIf the moon is obscured in three places, temples will be destroyed and men slain. If the moon is obscured during *zǐ-chǒu* (子丑), frost and snow will follow.\n\nIn summer and autumn, winds and clouds, thunderstorms, lightning, and plagues of insects or locusts will bring calamity to mankind.\n\nIn spring, the third month, if clouds resemble snakes or lightning strikes frequently, heavy winds and rains will occur in the sixth and seventh months.\n\nWhen *Xīn Jūn* (辛君) aligns with the *Celestial Minister* (使者), thunderclaps and lightning will strike between *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时), slaying evil and uprooting trees.\n\nIf *Xīn Jūn* (辛君) meets the *Thunder Master* (雷师) while roaming, violent winds and rains will follow, with thunderclaps slaying demons.\n\nWhen the *Celestial Minister* (使者) aligns with the *North Dipper Waters* (北斗都水) or the *Water Crystal* (水晶), thunderstorms will strike the next day between *wèishí* (未时) and *xū-hài* (戌亥).\n\nIf the *Celestial Minister* (使者) commands the *Heavenly Gang* (天罡) to drive away evil, thunderstorms will rage within one or two days.\n\nWhen the *White Qi* (白炁) *Wind Lord* (风伯) confronts the Dipper, the next day will bring violent winds sweeping the earth, flying sand and rolling stones, and thunderstorms.\n\nIf the *Celestial Minister* (使者) aligns with the *Thunder Master* (雷师) while roaming, the next day will see violent winds and rains, thunderclaps, and the slaying of demons.\n\nIf the *Celestial Minister* (使者) aligns with the *Water Crystal* (水晶), thunderstorms will strike the next day.\n\nWhen the *North Dipper Waters* (都水使者) ventures forth, thunderstorms will rage the next day between *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时).\n\nIf the *Purple Forbidden Enclosure* (紫微) inspects mankind, within three days, heavy rains will fall.\n\nWhen the *Heavenly Gang* (天罡) meets *Great Unity* (太乙), within seven days, torrential rains will turn the land into rivers, thunderclaps will strike, temples will be destroyed, and men and beasts slain.\n\nIf *Great Unity* (太乙) enters the Dipper’s abode, black *qi* (炁) clouds gather, enveloping the Dipper. Rain will fall that very night. If the Dipper clears, thunderstorms will strike the next day between *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时), with violent winds and lightning.\n\nIf clouds surge like mist into the Dipper’s mouth, the same will occur.\n\nWhen greenish radiance appears in the *jiǔ-jiǔ* (九九) cycle, drought will follow—prayers will be futile, and locusts will swarm, their light lingering.\n\nIf the *Celestial Minister* (使者) appears as a black pig, crossing the river in formation, thunderstorms will strike the next day between *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时).\n\nIf the sound of the *Milky Way* (天河) resembles wind, named the *Celestial Minister Rolling Waters* (使者卷水), torrential rains will follow, flooding even flat ground.\n\nWhen the *Qi Fire* (欻火) unfurls its wings, thunderstorms will strike that very day between *shēnshí* (申时) and *yǒushí* (酉时).\n\nAll *qi* (炁) of the thunderous Dipper—when the *Perverse Gate Thunder* (鬼门上震) arises, its sound is hidden. If thunderclaps strike with a single resounding voice into the earth, this is the *Heavenly Thunder’s Tremor* (天雷发撼).\n\nWhen the *Qi Fire* (欻火) descends its clouds, they resemble phoenix wings or scales, appearing above green clouds until midheaven, then turning black. Or, clouds may appear at *shēnshí* (申时) as the sun sets.\n\nIf divine thunder descends, it roars from the east.\n\nWhen the *Xùn Thunder* (巽雷) descends, its clouds come from the east, or from the *Xùn* (巽) or south, level like a single stroke. Sometimes radiant, sometimes dark, they reach midheaven, bringing violent winds and rains.\n\nIf a dark cloud stretches like a single stroke in midheaven, and white clouds appear in the *Xùn* (巽) direction, no rain will fall.\n\nIf the *Water Thunder* (水雷) descends, its clouds rise upward, emerging from black or green clouds in wave-like patterns—then violent winds and rains will strike immediately.\n\nWhen the *Grand Age Thunder* (太岁雷) descends, its clouds are uniformly dark, with a faint edge of white, their radiance sharp like a brushstroke. Sudden thunder and swift winds will follow.\n\nIf the *Community Thunder* (社令雷) descends, its clouds are dimly black, like faded ink, with a white mist emerging from its center, resembling a painting. If this appears during clear or rainy weather, or if the rain’s shadow manifests, violent winds and rains will follow for seven days, then the situation will stabilize.\n\n**Xū Host** (虚宿):\n*Jiǎzǐ*

thunderous wind and rain resound.*\n*Dark and dense as mountains, wild as beasts,*\n*first comes the thunder, then the rain—no need for doubt.*\n\n*When mist and dew descend from the mountains, rain is imminent,*\n*heavy, then three days of thunderous rain.*\n*Light, then seven days of torrential downpour,*\n*when mist and qi obscure the sky, seven days of rain.*\n\n*As the sun sets, the* **Yǔqí** (雨旗) *appears at its feet,*\n*else the* **Shuǐqì** (水炁) *passes the Celestial Ford.*\n*If* **Shēnshì** (申) *is the fixed master,*\n*then wind and rain strike, and thunder fills the

      "translated_text": "**The *Rain-Yang Qi-Climate* (雨旸气候亲机)**\n\n**Title:** *Rain-Yang Qi-Climate* (雨旸气候亲机)\n**Author:** Unknown\n**Volume:** One scroll\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), Canonical Section (正一部)\n\n---\n\n**The *Rain-Yang Qi-Climate* (雨旸气候亲机)**\n\n**The Sun (太阳)**\nBefore the sun rises, first observe the morning *qi* (氣) at the eastern point where the sun emerges—this confirms its presence. If black clouds resemble a chicken egg or a flag-shaped mountain, with *zhènwū* (阵乌) hanging like a banner, and patterns of dragons, snakes, fish, or *lingzhī* (灵芝) and *mǔdān* (牡丹), then thunderstorms will occur on that day between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours.\n\nIf violet-black clouds pierce or surround the sun, or appear above and below it, thunderstorms will strike on that day. If black clouds resemble fish scales, there will be wind, but thunderstorms will only occur three days later. The *Rain-Yang Qi-Climate* (雨旸气候) is thus verified.\n\n**The Moon (太阴)**\nWhen the moon’s color is red, it portends great thunderstorms the next day. If it is greenish-red, the next day will have a bright, round luminous formation, like a chariot wheel. If the moon’s color is white and serene, there will be no thunderstorms the next day.\n\nWhen the moon is accompanied by white clouds forming a round luminous shape, not very distinct, and the day is windy, the thunderstorms will occur three days later. All other cloud formations are the same.\n\n**The *Tianqiang* (天罡) Stars**\nIf the *Tianqiang* (天罡) stars appear in two red hues and shake, thunderstorms will strike. If they appear in green and shake, there will be great calamity the next day. If white clouds rise above the stars, there will be great thunderstorms the next day.\n\nIf yellow clouds rise above the stars and *qi* (氣) penetrates the *Wénqǔ* (文曲) stars, there will be thunderstorms. If the clouds envelop the stars or white clouds emerge from the *dòu* (斗) constellation, thunderstorms will strike the next day, especially around the *wèishí* (未时) hour.\n\nIf the *qi* (氣) is calm and white, there will be no thunderstorms the next day.\n\n**The Big Dipper (北斗)**\nIf white clouds obscure the Big Dipper, there will be great turmoil the next day, especially between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours. If clouds appear above and below the Dipper, resembling fish scales, there will also be great turmoil the next day.\n\nIf white clouds envelop two or three stars of the Big Dipper, thunderstorms will strike the next day. If clouds within the Dipper resemble rippling water and are white, there will be strong winds the next day. If clouds appear like scattered fluff within the Dipper, there will only be wind.\n\nIf black clouds gather below the Dipper and surge upward, wind and rain will arise that very night. If violet-black *qi* (氣) appears below the Dipper or at its mouth, thunderstorms will strike three days later. If the *qi* (氣) is green, it corresponds to the *Wood* (木) day; if red, it corresponds to the *Fire* (火) day. For all other days, the cloud patterns are the same.\n\nIf yellow clouds pass through the Dipper, heavy rain will occur within three days. If white *qi* (氣) clouds pass through the Dipper, rain will also occur within three days. If black *qi* (氣) clouds pass through the Dipper, wind and rain will strike immediately. If lightning appears below the Dipper and extends across it or its mouth, rain will fall that very night.\n\n**The *Longqi* (龙炁) Qi**\nAt dawn, observe the eastern horizon for five-colored *qi* (氣) like threads extending westward—this day will have wind and rain, stirring clouds and mist. If the *qi* (氣) remains suspended in the midheaven without moving, thunderstorms will occur three days later.\n\nIn the evening, as the sun sets, if five-colored *qi* (氣) appears and extends eastward, thunderstorms will strike three days later.\n\n**The White Tiger (白虎)**\nAt dawn, if white *qi* (氣) appears in the east, not far from the sun, it emerges from the *yín* (寅) hour and follows the sun until the *shēn-yǐshí* (申巳) hours. Then, between the *yǒushí* (酉) and *xūshí* (戌) hours, thunderstorms will strike.\n\n**The *Héqi* (河炁) Qi**\nIf large black clouds form in blocks, there will be wind. If their shape resembles a pig, or if black clouds appear like rotting fluff, dried wood, or mist, or if they obscure the moon or appear above it, thunderstorms will strike the next day.\n\nIf white clouds appear like cotton fluff, there will be light rain. If clouds resemble fish scales and move from south to north, there will be southern winds the next day. If they move toward other directions, the same applies after sunset—verify accordingly.\n\n**The Thunder Seal (雷牌)**\nAt dawn, observe the southern horizon for the highest black clouds—this is called the *Thunder Seal* (雷信). If they rise until the *yǐ-wǔshí* (巳午) hours and then disperse in the midheaven, thunderstorms will strike between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours in the eastern direction.\n\nIf the clouds are high in the south, thunderstorms will strike in the east. For all other directions, the pattern is the same.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* emerges from the *Shénxiāo* (神霄) and issues commands, it will appear around the *yǒushí* (酉) hour, bringing violent winds, thunder, and torrential rain, along with flying sand that uproots trees.\n\nIf the *Qīn* (钦火) *Fire* descends to the *Water Palace* (水府) and unfurls flags to issue commands, appearing between the *shēn-yǒushí* (申酉) hours, it will strike that night around the *zǐshí* (子时) hour, causing thunderstorms and flooding the next day, with waves surging on land.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* emerges at sunrise, with black clouds resembling a chicken’s head or flag-shaped mountains, and patterns of *zhènwū* (阵乌), dragons, snakes, fish, *lingzhī* (灵芝), and *mǔdān* (牡丹), thunderstorms will strike between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours.\n\nIf the clouds resemble fish scales, there will only be wind. If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* rides the *Chōng* (冲) star and emerges between the *yǐ-wǔshí* (巳午) hours, thunderstorms will strike around the *wèishí* (未时) hour. If it appears around the *wèishí* (未时) hour, thunderstorms will strike between the *shēn-yǒushí* (申酉) hours.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* meets the *Jīntǔ* (金虎) *Golden Tiger* and issues commands with thunderous intent, the next day between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours will bring violent winds and thunderstorms, slaughtering humans and livestock, destroying temples, plunging the sky into darkness and the earth into chaos, and causing flying sand that uproots trees.\n\nIf it obscures the sun without dispersing, thunderstorms will strike that very day. If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* meets the *Jīntǔ* (金虎) *Golden Tiger* and issues commands, it will appear between the *yǐ-wǔshí* (巳午) hours, striking around the *wǔshí* (午时) hour, or emerge between the *shēn-yǒushí* (申酉) hours, bringing sudden violent winds and thunderstorms.\n\nIf it emerges from the *Gàn* (乾) direction, there will be slaughter and destruction. If it enters the *Xùn* (巽), *Gèn* (艮), or *Kūn* (坤) directions, there will be no calamity. If it enters the *Kǎn* (坎) direction, thunder, lightning, and rain will be dire. If it enters the *Lí* (离) or *Duì* (兑) directions, the outcome will be favorable.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* issues commands, thunderstorms will strike between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours, causing waves to surge on land.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* meets the *White Tiger* (白虎) and issues commands, the next day—especially around the *shēnshí* (申时) hour—will bring thunderstorms.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* meets the *Thunderous Wrath* (雷霆) and issues a great calamity, known as the *Red Rooster and Purple Goose* (赤鸡紫鹅), thunder and lightning will strike before the *wèishí* (未时) hour, toppling trees and slaughtering people, with torrential rain pouring down.\n\nIf the *Thunder* (雷) *Deva* transforms water, thunder and lightning will strike suddenly, bringing torrential rain. If the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* summons the *Thunderous Wrath* (雷霆) and all its calamities to obey, between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours, violent winds will carry flying sand and stones, thunder and lightning will strike, torrential rain will fall, temples will be destroyed, trees uprooted, and the sky darkened while the earth grows black.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* dispatches the *Golden Tiger* (金虎) to issue commands, and the sun has a halo (*yùn* 晕) with clouds shaped like dragons or snakes, thunderstorms will strike within three days, especially in the southeast, where temples will be destroyed and evil people slaughtered.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* and the *Great Unity* (太乙) meet and issue commands, appearing that day, the next day will bring violent winds and thunderstorms, slaughtering people and destroying temples, uprooting trees.\n\nIf the *Qi* (欻火) *Fire* lingers in its abode, appearing in segments or like a fabric curtain thousands to tens of thousands of *zhang* (丈) away, there will be severe drought and violent winds. If the sun is obscured afterward, thunderstorms will strike between the *wèishí* (未时) and *shēnshí* (申时) hours. If it obscures the sun and clouds extend toward the *Xùn* (巽) direction, there will be attacks on people and destruction of *jīng* (精).\n\nIf dark clouds appear and advance, also known as the *Red Rat* (赤鼠) *surrounding the City* (游城), within five to six days, there will be turmoil in the south. If the *Milky Way* (天河) remains cloudless that night during prolonged drought, it is an extreme omen—no prayers can avert it; this is the *Heaven’s decree* (天数).",
