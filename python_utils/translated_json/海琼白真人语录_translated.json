In an instant, dawn broke, and they forgot to return, sitting atop the perilous coil of stone. The Master bade his two disciples sit to his left and right.\n\nTurning to them, he said: \"Between heaven and earth, what evening is this? The path to the Divine Empyrean is distant, and few tread the Purple Palace. You two have studied the immortal arts for long—have you no doubts to ask?\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"Laozi said: *There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth.* How well this is put! Later generations call it the Dao, the mind, the nature, the spirit, the *qi*, the single thought, the Dharma, the teaching, the art, the sentiment. Alas! Branches diverge and schools multiply—do they yet know that *there is a thing, formless yet complete*?\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"The great creation makes no sound, yet the wind sighs and the pipes stir of themselves. Winter departs, and ice must float; spring arrives, and grasses grow of themselves. Swallows come with summer’s end, geese return with autumn’s fall; plum blossoms open in the frosty sky, fireflies glow in the moonlit night. This is simply the Way of nature. When you penetrate to this point, the mouth seeks words but speech fails, the mind seeks thought but reflection vanishes.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"The great creation acts not, and the primordial work governs nothing.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"How is this so?\"\n\nThe Master said: \"The nest knows the wind, the burrow knows the rain. Alas! What of man?\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"All the dharmas in the world, all the gates within the dharma—these are but formulas for compounding medicine, remedies for curing illness. Only when you know the decoction’s envoy does the medicine take effect.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What is the decoction’s envoy?\"\nThe Master replied: \"The heart is the envoy of the dharma.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"One day, the generals and officers of the Thunder Department reported: 'Wherever an incense burner is set, there is the Jade Clarity Palace of Divine Empyrean.' Yuanchang asked: 'The scriptures speak of thirty-six hundred divine maidens ever at my side, and the sigh within says thirty-six thousand spirits dwell in my body. These incantations are all the words of the Most High—are they real? Illusory? True? False?'\n\nThe Master answered: \"Within the human body dwell the Three Inner Treasures: essence, qi, and spirit. Spirit is the host; essence and qi are the guests. I am the host; the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens are the guests. The thirty-six hundred divine maidens and thirty-six thousand spirits are all transformations of essence and qi. Nowadays, men’s hearts are like restless monkeys and galloping horses, racing a thousand miles in a day—how much more when essence is depleted by lust and qi exhausted by anger? Moreover, the eyes are led astray by forms, the ears deceived by sounds. What benefit do they gain, while what they lose is beyond measure? They do not realize that the radiance of spirit scatters outward, qi and strength disperse in all directions. When essence and qi are no longer preserved, can the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens remain at their side? The ten thousand spirits are one spirit; the ten thousand qi are one qi. From the One arise the ten thousand; gathering the ten thousand returns to the One—all reside in one’s own spirit.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"A single human thought, when concentrated, becomes spirit; when scattered, becomes qi. When spirit gathers, it is called *hun*; when qi gathers, it is called *po* giving rise to life.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"When a person dies, it is called a ghost. Yang is *hun*; yin is *po*.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"*The Scripture of the Northern Dipper* was not composed by the Most High. It was recorded by Zhang Zhengyi of the Han dynasty, who transmitted the Most High’s intent to create it. Nowadays, people do not understand the scripture’s meaning and merely gaze at the stars and worship the Dipper. Within the human body, there is a single qi, rising in the east and setting in the west, ascending and descending—just like heaven and earth. The qi of heaven and earth consists of yin and yang; what humans receive is the same. As for the Northern Dipper in the sky, it revolves day and night, dividing yin and yang, determining the hours—thus heaven and earth endure through it. Why not reflect: who governs the single qi within the human body? Knowing who governs it is to know the Northern Dipper within oneself. *The Dipper Scripture* says: 'A household possessing *The Scripture of the Northern Dipper* ensures the prosperity of its livestock.' This refers to the Northern Dipper within the body, which governs its qi. Then the eyes do not crave sights, the ears do not seek sounds, the nose does not desire fragrances, the tongue does not long for tastes, the body does not seek touch, and the mind does not indulge in thought. Preserving this vital essence naturally leads to a peaceful dwelling and flourishing descendants.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"The Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Demons originally had only four generals: Cui, Lu, Deng, and Dou. Now four more have been added. The Plum Immortal’s Bureau for Summoning originally had only four generals: Pan, Geng, Lu, and Zha. Now four more have been added. These are all later additions, not part of the original method.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"In ancient ritual methods, some used the two generals Huang and Liu, others Gao and Ding, or Jiao and Zeng, or Sang and He, or Xu and Xie. Whatever was received from one’s master was effective without fail.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"*The Purple Text of the Heart of Heaven* states: 'The Three Origins penetrate emptiness; the Five Phases penetrate brilliance; the Eight Trigrams penetrate dawn; the Ten Directions penetrate truth.' Nowadays, people practice the *Eight Trigrams Penetrating Dawn* method but activate the spirit characters—this is ignorance of its origins, passing down confusion upon confusion.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"In ancient times, there was no Fengdu method. At the end of the Tang dynasty, Master Dayuan Hao first transmitted this method to the world for summoning and interrogating ghosts and spirits. The original method contained only eight generals, three talismans, four incantations, and the seal of the Fengdu General Record Bureau. Later generations added excessively, becoming overly verbose—how can such things be considered authentic methods?\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"The method clearly states the Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Demons—why is it called the Heavenly Mechanism Bureau? Thus, the Southern Culmen has the Heavenly Pivot Bureau, just as in heaven there is the Heavenly Pivot Ministry on the left and the Heavenly Mechanism Ministry on the right. The Heavenly Mechanism is the inner bureau of the Northern Culmen, while the Expelling Demons is the outer bureau. Likewise, the Heavenly Pivot is the inner bureau of the Southern Culmen, and the Southern Culmen also has the Memorial Presenting Bureau as its outer office.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"A single human thought can move heaven and earth. Now, when submitting memorials and dispatching generals and officers, after burning them, they should naturally reach their destination—why then do the Six Heavens’ demonic forces intercept them?\"\n\nThe Master answered: \"A thought of utmost sincerity, in accord with the Dao, can summon true spirits without doubt. In ancient times, there were those with filial hearts, sincere hearts, righteous hearts, compassionate hearts, resolute hearts, and loyal hearts—all moved heaven and earth in moments of offering. This was due to the singleness of their hearts and the rectitude of their thoughts. Nowadays, when people burn memorials to report to the imperial throne, it is merely the ritual teaching that compels them. The resonance of their thoughts is like shooting an arrow at a target, while the resonance of memorials is like thrusting a spear at an object. Though the arrow flies far, it arrives swiftly; though the spear is near, it is hard to reach. Thus, memorials are tangible things, and demonic forces can intercept them. But if thoughts arise from the formless, how can demonic forces intercept them?\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"Human thoughts arise and vanish ceaselessly—why can this thought not summon?\"\n\nYuanchang answered: \"Have you not seen how a cat hunts a mouse? Its eyes stare fixedly without blinking, its four paws crouch unmoving upon the earth, its heart harbors no stray thoughts, its mind entertains no idle fancies, its six senses align as one, and its head and tail form a single line—thus, every strike finds its mark.\n\nThe True Master said: \"Once the primordial chaos divided, the Three Realms took form. Though humans dwell between heaven and earth with small bodies, their spirit is vast; though their form is humble, their spirit is lofty. When Jade Toad once journeyed to the imperial court to present a memorial, the characters on the document were as small as millet grains. Yet upon reaching the celestial capital, those same characters grew as large as teacup saucers. Initially, while still in the human realm, the memorial’s paper was also quite short and narrow. But upon arriving in the heavens, it stretched over a *zhang* in height and two *zhang* in width. From this, we may understand the meaning of *The Hidden Words of the Great Brahma*: 'When clouds and *qi* coalesce, they form a mass over a *zhang* in size, where the Heavenly Perfected and August Ones take up their brushes to write.'\n\nLong ago, while perusing *The Records of Qingyuan*, I saw celestial script floating above Dragon Pool, inscribed with the words: 'Proclamation to the Black and Red,' revealed to the carp. Han Yu discerned it, saying: 'This is the decree by which the Supreme Lord beheaded the dragon,' and noted that each character was no larger than an inch. Yet one may suppose that in heaven, they were not merely an inch in size. Observing this now, there is no mystery—what appears vast in heaven transforms into vastness, while what manifests in miniature from the human realm remains small. It is like a person gazing into a mirror: a large mirror reflects a large face, a small mirror a small one.\n\nFrom this day forward, whenever preparing memorials on paper, ensure the sheets are one *chi* in height—no taller—and the characters as large as millet grains—no larger. This teaching is no deception.\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"I have long doubted whether refinement and deliverance are two separate matters—are they, or are they not?\"\n\nThe answer said: \"The *Scripture of Salvation* states that 'deliverance in the living body is one,' and also that 'refinement of the dead soul is two.' Now examining the *Records of the Crimson Numinous Immortals and the Salvation of Lives*, we find: 'The Southern Prosperity Palace oversees two palaces: the Upper Palace and the Lower Palace. The Upper Palace governs the Bureau of Refinement, while the Lower Palace governs the Bureau of Deliverance. The living body resides in the lower realm, thus it is overseen by the Lower Palace; the dead soul ascends to the upper heavens, thus it is overseen by the Upper Palace.' Collectively, they are called the Crimson Numinous Fire Mansion, also known as the Southern Prosperity Bureau of Refinement and Deliverance. Today, when people speak of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace Refinement Bureau, the authentic officials and those who handle its affairs use the seal of the Refinement Bureau, yet it concurrently governs matters of deliverance for the living body through talismans and registers—this is truly without basis. Since it is called the Southern Prosperity Refinement Bureau, and yet is also termed the Upper Palace Refinement Bureau, this too is without basis. Henceforth, there is no need to speak of Upper or Lower Palaces, nor of refinement or deliverance; simply call it the Southern Prosperity Refinement and Deliverance Bureau, and use the original bureau’s seal, for this alone has a proper foundation. The seal’s inscription reads: *Seal of the Southern Prosperity Refinement and Deliverance Bureau*. It employs the standard interlocking seal script of the human realm, one *cun* and three *fen* in diameter.\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"What of the pacing of the stars?\"\nThe answer said: \"The pacing of the stars often follows the *Yu* step, and the *Yu* step consists of five, which harmonizes the Five Phases and, over time, enables ascension. Generally, the pacing of the stars uses five steps, advancing and retreating according to the generation and overcoming cycles of the Five Phases. One moves like a cat or dog crouching before a snake: advancing five steps, retreating five steps; advancing seven, retreating seven. The four directions follow the numbers of the Five Phases’ generation and completion. Only after the snake is subdued can it be harmed. Observe how a mouse is pounced upon in the same way. When a cat or dog stalks a snake, if during its advance or retreat it is disrupted or startled by a person, the moment it turns, the snake seizes the chance to harm it—this is because the pacing of the stars was incomplete. As with the methods of the Eight Gates and Hidden Movement in *Dun Jia*, the essence lies in the numinous power of the pacing of the stars!\n\nXiang asked: \"There are doubts about the yin and yang *dou* (constellations) as commonly transmitted.\"\nThe answer said: \"Today, people begin with the left foot for the initial star, reciting from *Kui* to *Piao* for the yang *dou*, and with the right foot for the initial star, reciting from *Tan* to *Po* for the yin *dou*. How mistaken! This is a baseless theory. The *Scripture of Flying Spirits to Pay Homage to the Dipper* states: 'Proceeding in order is yang, reversing is yin. From *Kui* to *E* is proceeding in order; from *Piao* to *Kui* is reversing.' The essential point is simply: 'If you wish to fly your spirit, do not stray from the Perfected One.' The Perfected One is the third star. All else is the *ding* step. The *ding* step is treading, while a single step is a point. If you say otherwise, I know not what to tell you.\"\n\nLu asked: \"Is it permissible to summon generals with shouts and rebukes?\"\nThe answer said: \"The elders have said: 'Revere them as lords and fathers, command them as servants.' The method of summoning generals and officials is to move spirit with spirit. If a person lacks authority, the spirits will not be complete. When summoning, one must wield the edict of the Supreme Lord, then issue commands to left and right as if the spirits were present. Only thus can one’s spirit command their spirits. The Perfected Master told Xiang: 'Now, simply carry one register, hold one office, practice one method, and issue documents for one bureau. Before the generals and officials of that bureau, use only one talisman and one water, for it is merely the meeting of heart and spirit—use it, and it will be efficacious. It is like a true dragon: a single drop of water becomes a torrential downpour. Why employ such complexity?'\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"In recent times, there are those who practice the Lingbao methods, and I do not say these methods do not exist; likewise, there are those who practice Yuantong methods, and I do not say these do not exist; and still others who practice Hunyuan methods, and I do not say these do not exist. Yet with so many schools and such complexity in incantations and techniques, they are not truly of the Orthodox Unity. In ancient times, the Orthodox Unity was transmitted as the teaching, so the methods practiced were simple and easy. Today, how does Lingbao differ from Yuantong? How does Yuantong differ from Hunyuan? How does Hunyuan differ from Orthodox Unity? The human heart is originally Yuantong, originally Lingbao, originally Orthodox Unity, originally Hunyuan. From the one heart of humanity flow endless methods, just as from the one *qi* of heaven all things are born. Yet some say Hunyuan is one stage, Lingbao another, Yuantong another, and Orthodox Unity yet another—like the cuckoo, which is called *zigu*, *xiebao*, *White Emperor’s Soul*, *Reflecting Mountain Red*, *Pounding Medicine Bird*, or *Shu Crow*, yet it is but one cuckoo.\"\n\nThe Perfected Master said: \"All methods arise from the heart; there is no separate method beyond the heart.\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"Recently, I have observed that alongside the Lingbao methods, there is also a school called Yuantong, and another called the Supreme Contending Brightness Court method, some using the Supreme *Mo Ming* Court seal, others the Yuantong seal. The seal’s inscription reads *Lingbao Yuantong, Hunhua Xuanmi*, with these eight characters arranged in the eight directions. At the center of the seal are the four characters *Bureau, Court, Ministry, Prefecture*. The inner inscription of the seal is round, the outer square, embodying the meaning of Yuantong. In my humble opinion, *Lingbao Yuantong, Hunhua Xuanmi* is the seal of the heart. Can these eight characters be fully expressed by this wooden seal? The *Bureau, Court, Ministry, Prefecture* are the spirit terrace—can this wooden seal represent these? Little do they realize that Lingbao is inherently Yuantong, and Yuantong is inherently *Leng Ming*. Why then seek branches and leaves, creating such complexity?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"Truly, this is the *Yuantong* Dharma, yet the seal they have crafted—though claiming to embody *Yuantong*—fails to achieve it.\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"Do the methods of the *wu* shamans exist?\"\n\"Yet how can one distinguish their orthodoxy from heterodoxy?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"The methods of the *wu* shamans originated with King *Suōtǎn*, transmitted to King *Pángǔ*, then to King *Āxiūluó*, and again to King *Wéituó*, King *Chángshā*, King *Tóutuó*, the Ninth Lord of *Lǘ* Mountain in *Lǘ* Prefecture, the Seventh Lord of *Méng* Mountain, the Tenth Lord of *Héng* Mountain, the Third Lord *Zhào Hóu*, the Second Lords *Zhāng* and *Zhào*—and beyond these, their number is unknown.\n\nIn ancient times, the methods of the *wu* shamans included the *Pángǔ* Method, the *Língshān* Method, and the *Wènshān* Method, yet in truth, they were all one and the same *wu* method. The *wu* methods often appropriated the words of the *Supreme*, thus their practices frequently employed the incantations of the *Supreme*. Most laughable is this: in former times, beneath the talismans of the *wu* methods, the phrase *'The Supreme is in Heaven'* was written in cursive script. Yet today’s *wu* shamans, ignorant of the characters’ meaning, misread it as *'The Great King is in the Mysterious.'*\n\nAh! Ah!\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"In the methods, how should one recite the invocations?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Invocation is the meaning of *zhu*. The intent of invocation is to communicate with the gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth. If this were so, then the good and evil invocations of the world would everywhere receive their due response. Yet today, it is not so—why? Because the true meaning of invocation is not understood. The croaking of frogs in a well clamoring to the Great Purity, the buzzing of ants in their burrows clamoring to the Lofty Spirits—these are no different from the invocations of people today. How could such invocations elicit a response?\n\nAs for the incantations in the methods: first, they are proclaimed by the Golden Mouth of the Supreme; second, they are often the banners and titles of the generals and officers. Thus, the essence of incantation lies in the *fǎfǎ* (method of methods). Therefore, when one sighs, the generals and officers follow, and the exalted perfected ones hear. Why, then, are the incantations of people today ineffective? Because they do not grasp the meaning of invocation. The meaning of incantation lies in treasuring the mind’s focus and the eye’s visualization—then the summoning of generals and officers is as if the divine were present before one.\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"The *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* states: *Thirty-six above in Heaven, thirty-six below on Earth; the Great Mysterious is boundless, wondrous indeed is the Great Cavern Sutra.* Some take this to mean the two *hei* of yin and yang and the seventy-two seasonal nodes—is this correct?\"\n\nThe answer: \"This refers to matters within the human body. The *Níwán* corresponds to Heaven, belonging to *qián*; the number of *qián* is four; *qián* metal is *jiǎzǐ*, the number of metal is four, and *qián* employs nine. The *Wěilǘ* corresponds to Earth, belonging to *kūn*; the number of *kūn* is six, and *kūn* employs six. Thus, four nines make thirty-six, which is called 'above in Heaven,' and six sixes make thirty-six, which is called 'below on Earth.' This speaks of the thirty-six vessels in the human head and the thirty-six channels in the lower abdomen—Heaven and Earth are likewise. Only the human heart cannot be seen or heard, and so it is called 'the Great Mysterious, boundless, wondrous indeed—the Great Cavern.'\n\nLú asked: \"There are five precepts, the first of which is not to drink wine. Yet wine does not harm the Dao, though I fear it may cloud one’s nature. Should wine truly be forbidden?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The *Canon of Scriptures* states in the words of the Supreme: *Those of great talent and heroic refinement are only addicted to wine; the fermented brew fumes the heart, inverting nature and temperament, destroying the ten virtues and giving rise to the ten evils. The four thoroughfares are laid waste, and the six penetrations are blocked.*\n\nThe true master told his disciple: *The female immortal È Lǜhuá said to Yáng Quán: ‘The scholar of the Dao regards brocade as filth, sees rank and office as a passing traveler, and views gold and jade as tiles and pebbles. Without thought, without worry, without affairs, without action—he walks where others cannot walk, learns what others cannot learn, toils where others cannot toil, and attains what others cannot attain.’* Why is this?\"\n\nThe worldly pursue desires, while I embrace solitude;\nThe worldly study mundane affairs, while I cultivate tranquility;\nThe worldly toil for fame and profit, while I refine my inner conduct;\nThe worldly attain old age and death, while I attain eternal life.\n\nThe true master said: \"The ancients declared: *Only when one’s wisdom surpasses the teacher’s is one worthy of transmission; if one’s wisdom equals the teacher’s, one diminishes half the teacher’s virtue.* Moreover, as the texts say: *When the teacher labors yet achieves little, when the teacher is at ease yet achieves much*—this is the principle.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Among all things under heaven, only mercury and *naozi* (brain marrow) cannot be counterfeited. In our teachings, essence is likened to mercury and called *gong* (quicksilver), while the marrow of the head is called *nao* (brain). For mercury easily evaporates, and *naozi* readily dissipates. Even if sealed in a secure place, should anything draw them, they flee and vanish—just as pepper penetrates mercury. Nowadays, people’s essence and marrow are often seized by lust, leading to exhaustion. Alas!\"\n\nThe true master said: \"My former teacher, Chen Niju, once served at the Huizong Court. There, he encountered the Great Cavern Perfected, Master Sun, who told him: *In ancient times, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning and the Most High Lord Lao compiled the scriptures they had expounded, gathering and arranging them into a canon. Such texts as the* Scripture of the Northern Dipper, *the* Scripture of the Southern Dipper, *the* Scripture for Dispelling Disasters, *the* Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility, *the* Scripture of the Heavenly Youth, *and the* Numinous Treasure Scripture of Salvation for Humanity*—along with the titles of the Jade Emperor and the Celestial Venerable—all possess true traces of their origins.*\"\n\nI asked: \"What of the *Yuqie* teachings practiced today?\"\nHe replied: \"Their tradition claims descent from Śākyamuni’s teachings. Śākyamuni manifested as the Filthy-Trace Vajra to subdue the Conch-Crested Brahmā King, and thus this teaching was transmitted to vanquish demons and restrain heterodox paths. It relies solely on the thirty-three-syllable *Golden Wheel Filthy-Trace Mantra*. Within their school, the Medicine King Nāgārjuna assists them. Beyond this, there are the two great sages of Fragrant Mountain and Snow Mountain, the two great sages of Pig’s Head and Elephant’s Trunk, the two great sages of Mighty Might and Splendid Light, as well as Prince Nawen, King Dingshu, the Deep Sand Spirit, and the *Gatī* Spirit—all supporting their dharma. They are aided by vajra *yakṣas* and enforcers, though their generals number only four: Tiger *Garuḍa*, Horse *Garuḍa*, Ox-Head *Garuḍa*, and Golden-Head *Garuḍa*. No others exist.\n\nYet today’s false masters mingle terms from various Daoist methods, stomp their steps, twist their fingers, shout at the top of their lungs, leap wildly, shake bells and chimes, whip hemp snakes, and strike peachwood staves—greatly distorting the ancient teachings. This is hardly what Śākyamuni intended! Nevertheless, *Yuqie* remains one of the Buddha’s methods for subduing demons.\"\n\nI asked: \"In the countryside, many abstain from meat and observe fasts to serve the *Mingjiao*, calling it *demon-destruction*. Their followers claim it as the legacy of the Most High Lord Lao. Is this true or false?\"\nHe replied: \"Long ago in the state of Sulin, there lived a layman named Moge. Initially, he failed in his pursuit of immortality, and later, he did not succeed in Buddhism. He withdrew to the Great Nāga Mountain, where he encountered an outer-path messenger from the Western Heaven named *Ripipojia Ming*. This messenger taught him a method to cultivate, and thus this teaching was left behind. In truth, it is irrational.\n\nTheir doctrine includes a prohibition, claiming that the entire earth—mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, water, and fire—is the *Dharmakāya* of Vairocana. Thus, they dare not tread upon or disturb anything. Yet even so, they stand *outside* the body of Vairocana’s *Dharmakāya*. Their practices—observing the eight fasts, worshiping the five directions—are merely precepts imposed by their teachings.\n\nTheir hierarchy consists of three ranks: the Heavenly King, the Illuminating Messenger, and the Numinous Form Earth Deity, who govern the teaching. Its essence lies in the eight characters: *clarity, strife, radiance, power, wisdom, and might*. Yet these eight characters originate from the mind. Can one who clings to forms in cultivation truly embody them? Moreover, they call it the *Mingjiao* (Teaching of Light), yet they themselves remain benighted.\"\n\nThe true master said: \"Whether ordinary or sacred, it is like a shadow following form—one becomes many, and many become one. Like the sun and moon reflected in myriad waters, their light is fundamentally undivided. Yet they arise with the water and appear with the eye. A single water with a thousand eyes yields a thousand suns and moons; a single water with one eye yields one sun and moon. A thousand waters with one eye yield one sun and moon; a thousand waters with a thousand eyes yield a thousand suns and moons. Like a shadow following form, it is ever thus. You cannot grasp it, nor can you abandon it; neither grasping nor abandoning, it remains unattainable.\"\n\nI asked: \"The so-called *yin elixir* and *yang elixir*—are these external elixirs or internal elixirs?\"\nHe replied: \"External elixirs are difficult to refine and yield no success; internal elixirs are easy to refine and bear fruit. The *yin elixir* and *yang elixir* are both internal elixirs. The *elixir* is the heart; the heart is the spirit. The *yang spirit* is called the *yang elixir*; the *yin spirit* is called the *yin elixir*—yet both are internal elixirs.\n\n*Yang spirit* enables *shedding the mortal coil and changing the bones*, a body beyond the body. When gathered, it takes form; when dispersed, it becomes shadow. *Yin spirit* is a single thought of pure numinosity, where the soul and consciousness have not yet scattered—like a dream, like a shadow, akin to a ghost. Those who cultivate the elixir must understand this.\"\n\nThe true master instructed Yuanchang: \"*The Red Spirit Jade Text* states: *The Eastern Pole of Precious Splendor, the Western Pole of Grand Purity, the Northern Pole for Driving Away Evil, the Southern Pole of the Celestial Pivot*—these are the Four Poles, while the Central Pole of the Five Thunders truly governs their affairs. Now, the Great Thunder of the Capital Heaven all emerges from above the Jade Pivot of Divine Empyrean, called the *Great Thunder of Scenic Empyrean*. Though the Scenic Empyrean lies below the Divine Empyrean, it is the abode where the Primordial Beginning sojourns.\"\n\nThe former Celestial Perfection dispatched the fierce official of the Thunder Department, Adjudicator Xin Hanchen, to bestow it upon my late master Chen Cuixu. Cuixu transmitted it to me, and now I pass it to you—guard it well.\"\n\nThe true master said:\n*\"When spirit returns to the vast, Mount Sumeru grows small;\nWhen qi enters the void, a mustard seed holds boundless space.\"*\n\nThe true master addressed Xiang: \"You claim the Eleven Luminaries Incantation is truly spoken by the Most High—is this clear to you?\"\nXiang replied: \"Indeed!\"\nThe master exclaimed: \"Hmph! That incantation speaks of 'Gan and Shi pushing the flow to submission,' yet Gan De and Shi Shen were both stellar sages—men of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. How could this scripture predate their birth? Test it thus: could these be the words of the Most High? Hmph!\"\n\nThe true master addressed Yuanchang: \"You assert the worldly *Hunyuan Ruyi* method is authentic?\"\nYuanchang replied: \"Yes.\"\nThe master exclaimed: \"Hmph! That method contains an incantation invoking the *Statutes and Ordinances of the Northern Pole Protector Sage Perfected Lord*, and also the *Statutes and Ordinances of the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Master Who Upholds and Assists the Primordial*. If true, this is dubious indeed. The Protector Sage was a man of the Zhou dynasty, and the Celestial Master a man of the Han—were the *Hunyuan* method already extant before the Most High, it would not invoke the statutes of the Most High Lord Lao, let alone those of the Protector Sage and the Celestial Master! What then of the *Primordial*?\"\n\nHmph!\n\nLu asked: \"Recently, I have heard of the *Yuantong* method and have privately harbored doubts about it. Its talismanic seals are round on the inside and square on the outside, with the Five Agents at the center and the Eight Trigrams surrounding them. The provincial and prefectural offices, as well as the various bureaus, are arrayed at the four directions. It takes the four characters *Lingbao Yuantong* as its宗 and *Hunhua Xuanmi* as its本. It cobbles together talismans, diagrams, incantations, and oral instructions from various methods to forge a single system, calling it the *Great Yuantong Method*. Does the master affirm this or not?\"\n\nThe master replied: \"The spirit has no fixed form, hence it is called *round*; the primordial has no fixed substance, hence it is called *penetrating*. In ancient times, the teaching of *Yuantong* referred to the fusion of spirit and *qi*, issuing forth into the formless and returning to primordial chaos. If one now takes shapes, instruments, trigrams, and numbers as its basis, how far removed is this from true *Yuantong*? Moreover, such a method did not exist in antiquity. Alas! The errors of false masters are not the fault of sentient beings.\"\n\nThe true master addressed Xiang: \"Do you know of the two envoys, *Qingyang* and *Tuoluo*, within the Dipper?\"\n\nXiang replied: \"I would hear of this.\"\n\nThe master said: \"*Qingyang* is a human term; in the heavens, it is the sound of *Zhangshan* (Upholding Goodness). *Tuoluo* is a human expression; in the heavens, it is the word *Duda* (Great Assembly). The *Qingyang* envoy holds a jade vase and a golden lotus; the *Tuoluo* envoy carries a golden tray and a censer of *baixieshou* incense. The views of the vulgar world are mistaken indeed!\"\n\nThe true master said: \"My former master once remarked: 'What great joy exists in the human realm!' Yet suffering and joy ever follow one another in cycles. Joy does not last a hundred years, but suffering endures for ten thousand kalpas. In this world, those with wealth cling to it unto death, while those without it beg unto death. I have never seen men contend with wealth for their lives rather than contend with their lives for wealth.\"\n\nHmph! The true master addressed Yuanchang: \"Do you know that all the methods I teach are methods of the heart?\"\n\nYuanchang replied: \"I know this.\"\n\nThe master asked: \"What then is the heart?\"\n\nYuanchang said: \"I do not know.\"\n\nThe master said: \"If you do not know, how can you practice?\"\n\nYuanchang replied: \"All dharmas are none other than methods of the heart.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Then practice for now. With time, you will know; knowing, you will not know; not knowing, you will know. Though you do not know, how is this different from knowing?\"\n\nUpon hearing these words, Xiang and Yuanchang leapt with joy, moved to sorrow, and awakened profoundly. Master Haiqiong rose with a smile.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial of Transmission and Thanksgiving**\n\nTo the Supreme Divine *Shenxiao* Jade-Pure Prefecture, Commander of Thunder and Lightning, Marshal of the Five Thunder Generals, and Director of the Thunder Bureau’s Ghosts and Spirits:\n\nYour servant, Yu Chan, respectfully states: On the fifteenth day of this month, we humbly submit this memorial on behalf of Peng Xiang, Envoy of the Supreme Clarity Great Flower Cinnabar Scenery Office and Scribe of the Divine *Shenxiao* Jade Prefecture’s Western Terrace, Acting Judge of the Xiandu Wind and Thunder Bureau; your servant, Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Mysterious Capital Three Sceneries Dharma Master, Grand Master of the *Taiyi* Thunder Register, Ninefold Numinous Flying Paces Transcendent Official, and Signatory of the Various Bureaus’ Dharma Courts for Ghosts and Spirits; your servant, Liu Yuanchang, Orthodox Unity Alliance-Wei Dharma Master, Acting Judge of the Expelling Demons Court, Southern Chang Register Keeper, Ninefold Numinous Flying Paces Transcendent Official, concurrently Director of the Thunder Bureau’s Ghosts and Spirits; your servant, Lin Boqian, Registrant of the Supreme *Sanwu* Merit and Service Record, Right Attendant Scripture Keeper of the Divine *Shenxiao* Jade Prefecture; your servant, Pan Changji, Registrant of the Supreme *Sanwu* Merit and Service Record, Right Attendant Scripture Keeper of the Divine *Shenxiao* Jade Prefecture; your servant, Zhou Xiqing, Disciple of the Supreme *Sanwu* Merit and Service Dharma Record, Practitioner of the Heavenly Heart Orthodox Dharma and Acting Judge of the Expelling Demons Court, concurrently Managing the Five Thunder Envoys’ Court; your servant, Hu Shijian, Orthodox Unity Alliance-Wei Dharma Master, Practitioner of the Supreme Clarity *Hunyuan* Heavenly Heart Five Thunder Great Dharma, appointed to Direct the Expelling Demons Court, concurrently Managing the Thunder Bureau; your servant, Luo Zhida, Disciple of the Supreme *Sanwu* Merit and *Zixu Yangguang* Secret Record, Practitioner of the Supreme Clarity Northern Culmen Heavenly Heart Orthodox Dharma, Golden Watchtower Inner Terrace Refiner and Transformer, Right Judge of the Expelling Demons Court; your servant, Chen Shoumo, Orthodox Unity Alliance-Wei Dharma Master, Practitioner of the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Heart Jade Dawn Five Thunder Great Dharma, Ninefold Numinous Flying Paces Transcendent Official, Director of the Expelling Demons Yellow Register Court; your servant, Zhuang Zhirong, and others—having been entrusted with the Daoist methods, we have memorialized and received imperial approval to register and confer the aforementioned appointments.\n\nWe humbly submit that the Dharma has its orthodox transmission, fortunately inherited through the master’s teachings, and offices are never conferred in vain, for we aspire to repay the celestial grace. Daring to express our private gratitude after the audience, we now present this bound memorial from within.\n\nYour servants, ephemeral as cicadas, ignorant as ants—unworthily numbered among the people of the Central Kingdom, we owe our very existence to the great Potter’s craft. Gazing up at the encompassing embrace of Heaven and Earth, bathed in the radiance of sun and moon, we sit and eat in shame, for what merit have we rendered unto the world?\n\nTracing back through kalpas untold to this present life, we possess this body and have reached this moment—yet the three evil and unwholesome deeds—killing, stealing, and lustful transgressions—along with the six roots clouded by ignorance, greed, hatred, and delusion, have amassed sins vast as the sea and karmic burdens heavier than mountains. By the grace of the Supreme Perfected Ones, who opened the gates of repentance and confession, even the most foolish are granted a path to lay bare their faults. Thus, past transgressions are absolved, and future calamities are averted.\n\nYet, in our dim-witted devotion, we have failed the molding hands of the Dao. From early affinity with the Way, we encountered the *Divine Empyrean Five Thunder Scriptures*; as mortals yearning for transcendence, we received the *Supreme Highest Ninefold Numinous Decrees*. Thereby, we came to grasp seals within our palms and dispatch talismans with our brushes, commanding wind and thunder, distinguishing between humans and spirits, aiding the living and delivering the dead, upholding the upright and expelling the perverse. How could we dare, mired in the dust of the mundane hall, to tread upon the celestial pivot of the *Big Dipper*?\n\nSince ancient times, transmission and reception have been thus; today, we humbly uphold and practice them. Internally, we refine the elixir; externally, we accumulate merit and conduct. Embodying Heaven’s transformative power, we assist the state and succor the people.\n\nWe reverently consider the *Highest Supreme Divine Empyrean Jade Pure Perfected King*, the *Great Emperor of Longevity*—whose Dao is vast and ineffable, whose virtue is boundless and all-pervading, parent to all beings, lunar preceptor of the celestial realms. He orders the nine streams before the myriad harmonies, governs the eight directions beyond the vastness of the firmament, extending compassion to save the world and employing skillful means to deliver humanity.\n\nYour servants, though but scribes in the Eastern Terrace and minor functionaries in the Western Bureau, have studied the rites of dividing talismans and breaking contracts, performed the ceremonies of pledging with blood and imbibing cinnabar, and sworn to lead the generals and officials in achieving extraordinary merit—all relying on the talismanic charts to propagate the great teachings. May Your profound benevolence, in hidden and subtle ways, deign to look upon us. We pray to sweep clean the dust of seas and mountains, seal the caves of demons and malevolent spirits, and open the gates of emptiness and non-being, that the winds of *Orthodox Unity* may once more flourish.\n\nPresuming upon the awe of Heaven, we obey and receive the Emperor’s mandate. Should we be granted Your sheltering protection, we shall proceed with our undertakings. Though our bodies have not yet attained perfect realization, the black embryo still requires the *Jade Black*; though our spirits have not yet entered the wondrous, the *Heavenly Heart* must harmonize with celestial wanderings.\n\nWith utmost reverence and trepidation, your servants humbly present this memorial for Your august perusal.\n\nKowtow! Prostrate bow! Reverently bowing again, I humbly submit:\n\nMemorial presented by your subject Yu Chan, of indeterminate rank, on a day in the tenth month of the eleventh year of Jiading in the year *wuyin* of the Great Cycle.\n\n**Three Poems from the Divine Empyrean**\n\nVast and distant, the Divine Empyrean,\nWhen shall dawn break over the Jade Capital?\nJade flowers glisten with dew-laden elixir,\nJewel trees whisper in the wind’s refrain.\n\nJade consorts attend the cloud-scriptures,\nFeathered lads dance with golden plumes.\nAlas, the people of this world below,\nChasing red dust in vain, day after day.\n\nPurple jade soars over the Pure Metropolis,\nEmerald clouds guard the crimson palace gates.\nNo stars are seen—only sun and moon,\nGazing down upon the earth below.\n\nTwo thousand years have passed in this world,\nDaring not speak of it to mortal ears.\nI have already refined the Golden Elixir,\nLeaving behind the secret of flying immortality.\n\nScribes of the Jade Emperor’s incense table,\nMinisters of the Golden Gates’ forbidden walls,\nPrecious censers simmer with sun and moon,\nIron rods lash thunder and lightning.\n\nAt dawn, I refine the clouds of Western Mountains,\nAt night, I brew the stars of the Northern Dipper.\nTo the tree spirit south of the city, I declare:\n\"My home lies in the Jade Capital.\"\n\nMy master, Lord Haiqiong,\nFlew his monastic staff between Mount Kang and Lu.\nIn the spring of *wuyin* in Jiading,\nA letter summoned me to the Wuyi Mountains.\nI, bound by clan duties,\nReceived an official summons to the capital.\nI departed in summer and returned in autumn,\nHiring a boat to seek our covenant—\nYet he was nowhere to be found.\nThus, I left these three poems as a record.\n\nIt was said: My wife, Zhou Xiqing, rode here in tandem.\nOn the Double Ninth of that year,\nZiyuanzi left his eldest son, Yuanshan, skilled in calligraphy.\nBefore the *Zhizhi* Hermitage, along the Nine-Bend Stream,\nI moored my boat to gaze at the slanting sunlight.\nI asked passersby if the master had returned—\nOnly to see dragons and serpents soaring on the walls.\n\nThe true master’s traces vanished,\nHis brushwork alive upon the walls.\nI strode to seek the Bone-Transforming Cliff,\nBut found only his discarded husk interred in a jade casket.\nWas Ziyuan not destined for immortality?\nYet who would guide me now?\n\nToday, precisely the Double Ninth,\nWind carries osmanthus fragrance from the grotto.\nWith my wife, I gathered chrysanthemums,\nReturning to fill our cups with ninefold rosy clouds.\n\n**Immortal Lyrics Presented to Ziyuan**\n\nRiding a jade turtle by night to pluck the bright moon,\nIn the elixir hall of the jade terrace, the cold pierces to the bone.\nThe thirty-six heavens never close their gates—\nWind scatters jade flowers like flying petals.\n\nFrom whose flute does the melody arise?\nEighty thousand *nishang*-clad beings sing *White Snow*.\nThe Purple Emperor, having feasted, prepares to depart,\nAdjusting his robes and holding his tablet to pay court.\n\nThe Fire-Link General barks a command—\nTen thousand immortals to his left and right bristle.\nHe petitions: \"Your servant was once an officer of thunder,\nBanished for an offense from the cinnabar gates.\nBuried in red dust up to my ears,\nI ate greens and drank dew, keeping strict austerities.\nNow, my spirit ascends to heaven parched with thirst—\nIf the Emperor has wine, let me take but a sip,\nGranting your servant a drunken release to return home.\"\n\nReturning to the mortal world, I tell others:\nAt the Phoenix Pavilion, I inquired about the way back.\nJade lads and jade maidens asked me:\n\"In heaven, the days are long and the Great Purity vast—\nIs the mortal world at all like this?\"\nI shook my head, gave no answer, and brushed my sleeves,\nWhite clouds stretching endlessly, veiling the Pure Metropolis.\nIn the grotto, gibbons and cranes recognize one another,\nWhite stones gleam while green pines wither.\n\n**Thirty Poems from Huayang**\n\nMy home lies on Qiong Isle, ten thousand leagues away,\nThis body comes and goes like a solitary boat.\nLast night, in a dream, I rode the west wind home—\nGazing toward my homeland, tears streamed in vain.\n\nThe southern seas are a realm of water and clouds,\nTen years have blurred my vision with longing.\nIn fleeting moments of reflection,\nThe west wind and evening sun choke the sad cicadas.\n\nSince parting from the southern seas’ boat,\nMy body has followed the clouds to Jiang-Zhe’s skies.\nI’ve wandered through grotto-heavens seeking recluses—\nI wonder how many straw sandals I’ve worn through.\n\nWhite clouds accompanied me to Tiantai,\nMy eyes met green mountains, my heart opened wide.\nYet upon reaching those peaks, new longings arose—\nEverywhere, the night apes’ cries bring sorrow.\n\nLeaning on my staff, I entered Wuyi,\nBeneath Manting Peak, snowflakes flew.\nWalking along the Nine-Bend Rapids,\nTen thousand ravines and a thousand cliffs encircled me in emerald.\n\nIn Wuyi, I built a thatched hut for two years,\nFlowers smiled, orioles sang—spring in a flask.\nStream water flowed down the mountain, people emerged from grottoes,\nBefore the cliff, only the empty alchemy furnace remained.\n\nHaving obtained the formula, I returned to test refinement—\nDragons and tigers clashed in an instant.\nIf the people of Jiuhua Peak knew,\nA single night’s wind and thunder would shake ten thousand mountains.\n\nAt the White Horse River’s head, I let out a roar—\nCrimson light and purple mist arose from the water.\nQuickly, I drew the green-snake sword from its scabbard—\nOnly then did the Yellow River run clear to its depths.\n\nI drank hundreds of goblets of golden waves,\nWhen drunk, I brandished my sword toward the void.\nMy feet playfully tread the *Qian* and *Dou* constellations,\nA long whistle—heaven and earth turned red.\n\nI moved the Northern Dipper past the Southern Asterism,\nWith both hands, I lifted the sun and moon.\nFlying to Kunlun’s summit,\nIn an instant, I transformed into a cloud covering the sky.\n\nPlayfully sailing a golden boat to the sea’s edge,\nSecretly following the sea’s waters through flowing sands.\nOnce I stepped onto Penglai’s shore,\nI went to admire the flowers of the Jade Terrace and Celestial Gardens.\n\nThe human body itself contains a Penglai,\nTwelve-tiered towers with white jade steps.\nThe Crimson Maiden and Golden Boy often meet in the tower,\nBefore the hall, peonies bloom every night.\n\nA strange matter that makes one laugh several times:\nNow even men can conceive.\nTheir own essence and blood unite in congress—\nWithin the body, husband and wife are wondrous indeed!\n\nOne chant, one drunkenness, one *daogui* of elixir,\nTrue *qi* and true essence fill the four limbs.\nWhen wine’s warmth lulls me to deep sleep,\nMy boat, laden with treasures, sails past Caoxi.\n\nThe primordial spirit lodges nightly in the cinnabar field,\nClouds fill the Yellow Court, the moon fills the sky.\nTwo mandarin ducks float on green waters—\nIn the water’s heart, a single purple-gold lotus.\n\nHungry, I eat a morsel of black turtle liver,\nCold, I turn to the cinnabar field’s raging fire mountain.\nSeeing no affairs in my heart,\nI know not that the world suffers hunger and cold.\n\nThe Green Ox Man departed how many years ago?\nThis Dao lies clearly before our eyes.\nIf you wish to recognize the true state before you—\nA hall where wind is cool and the moon is fair.\n\nIn a moment’s effort, I refine mercury and lead,\nA furnace’s fierce fire burns the night sky.\nSuddenly, divine water falls into the golden well—\nFusing the numinous cinnabar, round as the moon.\n\nA pool of divine water fills the Hua Pond,\nNightly, white snow flies by its edge.\nWithin the snow, someone seizes the jade hare,\nDriving the bright moon to ascend the cold branch.\n\nNot a thread stirs as I pass the Jade Pass,\nAt its summit stands the Jade Capital Mountain.\nShould one traverse its depths to and fro,\nWind churns the nine skies with frost and snow’s chill.\n\nWho perceives the workings of the celestial revolution?\nNow all is compressed within a fleeting moment.\nSimply take lead and mercury into true earth,\nAnd refine golden blossoms to fill the crucible with crimson.\n\nLast night at the third watch, thunder shook the mountain,\nThe gates of the nine heavens remained unbarred.\nUpon the path of Caoxi, I saw clearly—\nA golden crow entered the vast cold.\n\nThe Caoxi road pierces the mud pill,\nConfined between the upper and lower cinnabar fields.\nMaster the union of the golden elder and the maiden,\nWhere morning clouds and evening rain fill Mount Wu.\n\nUse only wù and jǐ as the elixir furnace,\nRefine the red pellet into jade nectar.\nGently tend the fire for three hundred days,\nAnd yield a luminous pearl that shines through the night.\n\nA scattered gentleman of the Crimson Palace’s immortal realm,\nI wander the mortal world feigning madness.\nWithin this body lies the treasure of eternal life—\nNightly, my spirit soars to pay homage above.\n\nMy home lies in the Nine Dark Heavens of Divine Radiance,\nWhere celestial towers and halls house the host of immortals.\nHaving chanced upon the human world,\nI reckon not even a year has passed in Divine Radiance.\n\nA jade sovereign’s page beneath the throne,\nOnce keeper of talismans and guardian of the alchemical palace,\nWhy do worldly ties still bind me?\nNow this illusory form is trapped in the dusty cage.\n\nMy qi overshadows mountains and rivers, my heart bold,\nYet I neither wield the sword nor pore over books.\nLast night, my actions shook heaven and earth—\nNow I gently tend the jade crucible with measured fire.\n\nThis dreamlike body will not endure long,\nHow many mulberry and elm can withstand frost and wind?\nBetter to leap from the pit of fame and profit,\nAnd bestow upon you the formula for eternal life.\n\nI toy with rivers and mountains, my verses cunning,\nExhaling and inhaling wind and moon, my wine a divine art.\nWith poetry and drink, I deceive mortal eyes,\nPassing through the red dust for how many winters.\n\n**Inscription at Tianqing Abbey**\nI bought a leaf of a boat on Luo River,\nWorldly success melts like wax—ah, let it be.\nI lack the begging, tail-dragging demeanor,\nEarly on, I turned to ash-hearted retirement from office.\n\nI have learned to plow White Marsh like Zhuangzi of Qiyuan,\nContent to await the green ox as the Keeper of the Pass.\nWhat need have I for the elixir spoon—who would understand?\nOnly the bright moon and clear wind nod in approval.\n\n**Inscription at the Yue Shrine**\nA southern sword halts the three mountains,\nI claim my share of life’s wind and moon.\nWho will govern Jingyang to dispense medicine?\nI sought Mount Goulou to refine the elixir.\n\nI admire Zhuangzi’s salary in Qiyuan,\nLaozi once served as the Keeper beneath the pillar.\nI regard glory as a familiar sight—\nBetter to early refine the azure jade elixir.\n\n**Swallows Nest in a Flowering House**\nMy gaze stretches to the path of Divine Radiance.\nThe Dipper’s handle points south, cinnabar radiance and emerald hues,\nCrimson clouds and purple mists.\nI plucked jade flowers—now it seems a dream,\nWhere are the twelve towers and terraces?\nI still recall the companions of that time.\nWho now presides over the Eastern Palace and Western Terrace?\nI remember how we poured from the golden vase,\nThe affairs between us two, like wind-tossed willow fluff.\n\nThe August Sovereign, mighty thunder’s lord—\nWhy was I, in the green capital and crimson palaces,\nSo suddenly consigned to antiquity?\nThe white crane and blue crow’s tidings are cut off,\nMy dreams of phoenix songs and dances unfulfilled.\nI have yet to turn and return.\nKarmic debts must be repaid in full,\nThis time, I taste the bitterness of the red dust to the dregs.\nI shall report it all\nTo the Queen Mother of the West.\n\n**Again**\n\nThe moon is pinned like a green snail-shell coil,\nAt the willow’s tip, the sun lingers and fades,\nAutumn winds sway and drift.\nA few grains of dark mountains stretch to the distant Han,\nTree hues and misty light in purple and emerald.\nThe galloping riders are half-sober, half-drunk.\nSwords at their hips, they grind the stars in the autumn sky,\nPointing to the jade lads, yet dare not sound the golden bridle,\nLest they startle\nThe Purple Clarity Emperor.\n\nFloating clouds drift over Penglai’s waters.\nI recall the mountains—\nPines chilled by cold dew,\nGibbons wailing, cranes shrieking.\nMy home lies within the cliffs and valleys of Mount Wu,\nA single acre of mist and radiance for livelihood.\nI sigh, burning my fingers—\nA hundred years of human life.\nHow many ages have passed for orchid bowls and mushroom fields?\nBefore the grotto’s gate, young deer play among the flowers,\nUnaware of the world of men.\n\n**Presented to Attendant Sutra-Bearer Pan Changji**\nA speck of red dust stirs the heart,\nIn the Hall of Medicinal Pearls, a hairpin falls.\nOnce we descended together along the Jade Terrace path,\nYet now only Peng and He remain in the forest.\nDreaming of the mortal realm, I know not how to retreat,\nNight after night, beneath the window, I tune the jade zither.\nLaughing, I point toward the Divine Empyrean—\nWhen shall I return?\nThe crimson palaces and clear capitals lie veiled in mist.\n\n**Presented to Purple Radiance Attendant Sutra-Bearer Zhou Xiqing**\nA celestial maiden with moth-like brows,\nWhy did you descend to the red dust?\nWho now attends the Divine Empyrean’s medicine chest?\nThe purple courts’ jade flowers dare not bloom in spring.\nNo dreams of attending the Queen Mother’s feast,\nFor in a former life, you were surely a being of the Purple Void.\nI send word to seek the Penglai path,\nWhere the wind carries twin simurghs to the Great Brilliance.\n\n---\n*The Record of Master Haiqiong the White Real Man, Scroll One* (conclusion)\n*The Record of Master Haiqiong the White Realman, Scroll Two*\nCompiled by Disciples of the Fuzhou Tianqing Abbey, including Supervisor and Chief Daoist Administrator Ziguang Lin Boqian et al.\n\n**Crane Grove Dharma Teachings**\nOn the Lantern Festival of the *renwu* year of the Jiading era, the Patriarch, Master Haiqiong, received a letter from his preceptor, Master Helin, sent from Zhe to Min, on behalf of the preceptor’s father, the late Awakened Non-Master of the Ministry of Rites. He performed the Yellow Register rites.\n\nAt dawn on that day, the preceptor approached with incense tucked in his sleeve, bowing deeply in reverence. His words were as follows:\n“Since your departure from Min, I have practiced the Dao day and night, never daring to be idle. Yet Heaven, silent, has taken what I cherished. Recently, I submitted a memorial to inquire after the Dao, only to find what I valued already lost. I beg you, Master, to take pity.\nAt the moment of his passing, thunder roared and winds howled, filling the house with an extraordinary fragrance. Outside, the day was clear, yet no one heard a sound—his death seemed unlike others’. When we buried him, unbroken rain fell for days, then suddenly cleared. After the burial, the rain returned. Even the locals noted the strangeness.\nI presumptuously used the yellow thread for purification. Now that you have descended, Master, may the yellow thread’s purpose be fulfilled. The Three Realms will rejoice! The myriad spirits will celebrate!”\n\nThe Patriarch replied: “My disciple, there is no need for such excessive courtesy. Today is the Lantern Festival; I immediately ordered the establishment of a purification hall, the erection of a Jade Hall, and the installation of a Jade Casket Office, along with a Yellow Thread Bureau. From *chen* to *shen*, documents were prepared, oaths sworn to Heaven and Earth, and a memorial tablet planted at the gate.\nI appointed Xuanyi Zhao Rukuai as High Ritual Master, Zishu Lin Shizhong as Chief Lecturer, Ziguang Lin Boqian as Supervisor of the Vegetarian Feast, Fang Hao Jing’an as Attendant Sutra-Bearer, Yuling Deng Daoning as Attendant Incense-Bearer, Yuhua Chen Milong as Attendant Lamp-Bearer, Zihu Xie Xiandao as Altar Steward, Ziqiong Zhao Shoufu as Procession Overseer. I myself acted as the Supreme Clarity Yellow Register Envoy, serving as General Supervisor.\nThe appointments were to be finalized on the last day of the first month, the rites performed on the first day of the second month, the jiao completed on the fourth day, thanksgiving offered on the fifth, and the Thunder Rites held on the sixth. All fast and jiao rituals followed ancient forms, with nine-morning ceremonies conducted as usual.”\nThe preceptor assented daily.\n\nOn the first day of the second month, *gengchen*, at dawn, a torrential downpour began. The rain persisted for three days, the skies dark and stormy, continuing through three days and nights of the nine-morning rites. Yet as soon as the procession began to ascend for the audience, the skies cleared. Once the morning rites concluded, the rain returned—this pattern held for all nine mornings.\nOn the second day, *xinsi*, at *you*, as the memorial was presented, people worried over the rain. Just as the memorial was prostrated, the rain abruptly ceased. Clouds gathered on all sides, yet above the altar, the Northern Aster shone brightly, while outside, the rain fell as before. When the rites concluded, rain poured down upon the altar, and the onlookers rejoiced.\n\nThe Patriarch said: “The alternation of yin and yang is Heaven’s affair—mere coincidence. Why worry? Why rejoice?”\nOn the third day, *renwu*, at dawn, something was seen within the family shrine, believed to be the arrival of ancestral spirits. The preceptor, overjoyed, rushed in to report. The Patriarch swiftly stopped him, saying: “Let it be. The Great Dao is formless and does not favor apparitions. The Dharma is but the function of the Dao—it can summon the unseen. If someone sees something today, what is strange about that?”\n\nSomeone asked: “After the jiao rites concluded, the Welcoming of the Perfected and the Proclamation of Amnesty were completed, the skies cleared as they had been before the rites. Yet for the entire nine-day period—from beginning to end—there were three full days and nights of overcast rain. Why was this so?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied: “From ancient times to the present, when the Yellow Register Retreat is held, there is often gloomy weather. This is because the suffering souls of the hidden realm emerge from the gates of yin. Such conditions arise naturally in response to the rites.\n\nOn the seventh day, *bingxu*, the various divine officials were summoned, and the sacrifice to Thunder was performed. When the rites concluded, the sacrificial animals and wine-meats were buried in the *xun* direction along with the cinnabar talismans. It was agreed that when thunder sounded after three days, the talismans would be unearthed and placed in the Crane Grove Retreat.\n\nThat year, from the preceding winter, there had been no rain, making wheat planting difficult. With this Yellow Register Retreat, the earth received moisture. After the jiao rites, a thanksgiving feast was held in the oratory, and the divine officials were credited with their merits.\n\nThe Preceptor offered his gratitude, saying: “Master, in conducting these jiao rites, you have done what the people of this region have never witnessed, and what I have gained is beyond measure! The blessings bestowed upon the living have also been abundant. Your conduct has been flawless, your teachings like medicine and stone to the heart—unprecedented, unparalleled. Yet whenever reports of divine marvels or numinous wonders arise, you always suppress them. Why is this?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied: “It is mere coincidence. Why indulge in joy? I neither rejoice in their presence nor worry over their absence. I simply know to practice the Dao and uphold the Dharma, allowing things to unfold naturally. The reason for this is that I rely on sincerity to penetrate all responses and depend on the Dharma to carry out the affairs. What cause is there for joy or worry in between? If such thoughts arise, they only disrupt my right mindfulness.”\n\nSomeone asked: “What is the meaning of the *Yellow Register*?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied: “The deliverance of the Nine Yin realms from suffering employs the methods of the *Golden Register* and *White Writs*. The *Golden Register* is the *Yellow Register*, and for this reason, Heaven too has established a *Yellow Register* Court. *Yellow* is the origin of all colors; *Register* is the talisman of the myriad Perfected. This signifies that the principle of the Yellow Center governs qi, commands the myriad Perfected, guides souls from darkness to light, and saves the living while delivering the dead. *Register* also means *record*—it is the ledger of ghosts and spirits. *Yellow* also signifies *mastery*—it is the governance of the affairs of ghosts and spirits. Thus, the ghosts and spirits of the hidden realms have a master to oversee and record them.”\n\nThe Preceptor asked: “The Dipper is the Emperor’s Chariot, revolving at the center and overseeing the four directions to inspect portents. Thus, the scriptures say: ‘The Great Culmen of the Central Dipper supervises all spirits.’ The original scripture also states: ‘The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper are the great deities of the celestial center.’ The *Discourses of Lu* likewise says: ‘Like the North Star, all stars encircle it.’ If this is so, then the Dipper’s Pole is the image of the Unmatched, for it governs the entire starry river. Yet some ask: If the Dipper resides at the center of Heaven, why is it called the *Northern* Dipper?”\n\n“They do not realize that the Dipper’s handle begins its rotation at *zi* and completes it at *hai*, cycling day and night without end, ever pointing north—hence the name *Northern Dipper*. As for the *Southern Dipper*, it is merely the first of the northern lodgings among the Twenty-Eight Constellations and cannot compare to the Northern Dipper. In recent times, people have been misled by the name *Southern Dipper*, depicting it in red and even placing it above the Northern Dipper—how grave an error!\n\n“Others ask: The Dipper constellation lies within the degrees of the Twenty-Eight Constellations in the north. Why is it called the *Southern* Dipper? They do not realize that the Wall is in the north yet called the *Eastern Wall*, and the Well is in the south yet called the *Eastern Well*—this can be understood through reflection. How does this principle apply?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied: “Indeed, it is so!”\n\nAccording to the *Zhou Tian Star Chart*, the armillary sphere, and both ancient and modern astronomical texts, none mention the Southern Dipper as positioned above the Northern Dipper, nor do they recognize the name *Southern Dipper* at all. This is merely a concept within Daoism, referring to the *Six Offices of the Southern Dipper*—perhaps hidden stars in the heavens, yet unverifiable through investigation. According to ritual texts, the *Secret Taboo Names of the Southern Dipper* state [text missing], attributing it to the Southern Pole, the jurisdiction of the *Vermilion Numinous Fire Department* and the *Fire Bell Office*. There is also the *Inner Taboo Names of the Southern Dipper*, which reads: *Zhana Banqu Dahei*—thus confirming the existence of the Southern Dipper. If one wished to erase it, what would become of the scriptures?\n\nDushi asked: The five planets and six luminaries exhibit transgressions such as wandering, concealment, encroachment, and violations, as well as anomalies like rebelliousness, proximity, and eclipses—these are truly tied to disasters, calamities, and misfortunes. Those who perform rituals to avert disaster and transcend calamity must make petitions regarding them. Petitions are permissible, but one must establish their lamps according to celestial patterns! According to the *Essentials of the Golden Register*, all lamps have their prescribed forms. Yet why is there no prescribed form for these lamps? It is not an omission. For *Rahu*, *Ketu*, *Ziqi*, and *Comet* are hidden luminaries in the sky—those are concealed, while these are manifest. What does this mean?\n\nThe Patriarch replied: For example, in the lamp pattern of the Northern Dipper, the Right Assistant Star is also a hidden luminary, and thus no lamp is established for it—there are only eight lamps. *Rahu* is the residual blackness of fire, *Ketu* the residual qi of earth, *Comet* the residual qi of metal and water, and *Ziqi* the residual blackness of wood. Now, if we maintain the lamps for the eleven luminaries, there is no need to establish lamps for these four—it suffices!\n\nDushi said: Before ascending, the Han Celestial Master told people: “If anyone brings two *dou* of rice, I will explain things for them, just as Confucius never refused instruction to those who offered even a bundle of dried meat.” Thus, he was called the *Master of the Dou of Rice*. Today, many cite the *Scripture of Salvation*, which states: “Noble adepts offer gold and treasures, pledging their hearts to the heavens in transmission.” Yet they still greedily accept bribes and demand the full array of altar rituals. Why? Because nothing is harder to relinquish than one’s own wealth—hence the saying, “Food is heaven, wealth is life.” Thus, requiring them to contribute gold and treasures, or display silk banners, is meant to test their willingness to part with what they find most difficult to give up, thereby revealing their sincerity. If greed arises in their hearts, they have already lost the original intent!\n\nIt is also said: In a single altar ritual, the memorial to the heavens is of utmost importance. If the officiant possesses the Way of communicating with the true and attaining the numinous, then every petition will reach its destination. Thus, at the beginning of the *Welcoming the True*, the *Proclamation of Admonition* is recited; after *Sending Off the True*, the memorial is burned. In recent years, after the *Welcoming the True* and the *Proclamation of the Memorial*, the memorial is instead brought out to the central courtyard to be burned. For instance, if the true are welcomed from the north, yet the memorial is proclaimed here, then taken out and burned—why? From this, it is clear that the officiant lacks the practice of *visualization*—this is certain!\n\nThe Patriarch said: The *Jade Mirror of the Numinous Treasure* states: The *Treasure Banner for Translocating Spirits* should be dyed with *fei* color, with the taboo names of the Three Clarities inscribed on both sides, and the characters *Treasure Banner for Translocating Spirits* written on the banner’s body. Today, though the color remains the same, the dimensions differ, the calligraphy varies, and it is named the *Treasure Banner for Translocating Spirits* at dusk—this is incorrect. Furthermore, in ancient methods, two banners were placed within the *Lamp Wheel of the Five Sufferings and Nine Hells*, and during the *Summoning*, they were positioned before the incense and music—these two banners served a purpose. Now, they are merely erected at the gate for decoration, ignorant of their use!\n\nFor example, the *Yellow Banner of the Grand Return in the Supreme Subtlety* has its proper banner form, and the *Numinous Banner of the Command of Wu Ying* has its own banner form. Yet today, none understand their significance, and whether they are banners or flags is scarcely distinguishable.\n\nIt is also said: According to the *Disciplinary Texts of the Yellow Register*, when the summoned souls of the deceased arrive, one should cultivate benevolent thoughts to deliver them, not weep sorrowfully to harm their spirits. The ritual master must issue strict warnings beforehand; if the warnings are not stern, it is a violation of the precepts. This is the true intent of delivering the dead. The natural human inclination is to cling to life and fear death—if one cannot equalize life and death, who can forget their own mortality? As long as a single thought of attachment remains, liberation is impossible. Thus, the Supreme Lord’s intent in delivering beings is first to shatter their fear of death. Yet today, not only do they fail to restrain sorrowful weeping, but they artfully feign grief, inducing tears to deepen confusion and delusion.\n\nIt is also recorded in the *Great Method of the Five Thunders of the Divine Empyrean*: The *White Memorial of the Three Heavenly Lords of the Three Primes* is one; the *Golden Writ of the Middle Prime* and the *Precious Proclamation of the Nine Heavens* is another; the *Register of Ascending the True and Delivering Life* and the *Talisman for Departing from Life and Death* is yet another. Though memorials, talismans, proclamations, and registers bear different names, they all serve the Supreme Lord’s purpose of delivering all beings. Yet today, the *proclamation* of *announcement* is confused with the *proclamation* of *official rank*, and the *White Memorial* along with the *Talisman of Ascending the True* are all included and bestowed upon the deceased. What use could they possibly have for these?\n\nIt is further said: The *Talismans of Salvation from Suffering and Longevity* possess immense efficacy. Since they are called *primordial talismanic commands*, how can they be treated lightly? Thus, the *Lu Zhen Official* must submit a petition requesting them, and upon their completion, they are secretly transmitted to the Three Officials and the Thirty-Six Prisons. Yet today, it is not so—their inscription is not preceded by a petition, nor is their completion followed by secret transmission. Moreover, they are handed over to others, and the high priest is not involved! The worldly tradition claims these two talismans possess great efficacy in delivering the dead, requiring one talisman per deliverance, whether ten, a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand—all are tallied, and none dare be omitted.\n\nI have privately observed that the white slips are but wood, and the red script but cinnabar. If mere white wood and red cinnabar could deliver the dead, then none beneath the Nine Springs would remain undelivered. Alas! Whether the divine is made manifest depends upon the person. If it is not the right person, the Dao does not operate in vain. Were all practitioners truly those who penetrate the real and comprehend the numinous, and possessed a sincere heart to aid the living and deliver the dead, then even a single talisman or slip would suffice to deliver ten thousand souls and more!\n\nIt is further said: According to the *Ancient Rituals of Petitions* and the *Continued Rituals of Petitions*, the formats of all petitions are provided so that later generations may have a standard to follow. Yet today, it is not so—a petition is copied in its entirety from an ancient text, not daring to alter a single character. If this were the case, then the ancients who submitted petitions must all have memorized the words within them—would this not have been an easy task? Submitting, prostrating before, preserving, and presenting a petition all share the same intent. If one cannot do so, then merely saying \"burn the petition\" would suffice! Instead, the task is delegated to the Generals, Talisman Clerks, Merit Officers, and Envoys, who are relied upon to transmit it.\n\nWhen setting up an offering and presenting a petition, each has their own duties, so that they may focus. Thus, the mind is free of distracting thoughts, the body free of extraneous tasks, embracing the primordial and guarding the One. As the *Lu Zhen Official* said: \"Seven days before the offering, nothing unrelated to the rite may be undertaken.\" Only then may it be performed. Yet today, it is not so—there are those who attend a funeral in the morning and perform a petition offering in the evening, those who submit petitions on behalf of their masters without changing the names, who do not select the proper day or time, do not distinguish directions, do not differentiate between dawn and dusk, and are ignorant of taboos. Such actions hasten misfortune from Heaven—how can one not be cautious!\n\nLin Boqian asked: May I inquire about the regulations and teachings?\n\nThe Patriarch replied: The sages of antiquity, recognizing the difficulty of entering the study of the Dao and the ease with which the worldly desires lead one astray, established texts on ritual regulations, precepts, and models to unify external conduct. They provided methods for concentrating the mind and fixing the spirit to rectify the heart and restore it, and techniques for refining qi and the primordial embryo to regulate diet. They also included offerings for invoking the real and expressing gratitude to cleanse transgressions. Only then did they proceed with study.\n\nThose without learning reach the depths of ignorance, grasping at the repository of diminishing and further diminishing. When one aligns with non-action, the gates of deceit and cunning do not open, and the purity and harmony of tranquility can be attained. Thus, the scriptures speak of the Three Registers and Seven Grades.\n\nThe Three Registers are:\nFirst, the *Golden Register Retreat*, which eliminates celestial disasters and protects and stabilizes the kingdom—used only by emperors.\nSecond, the *Jade Register Retreat*, which delivers the people, requests blessings, and expresses repentance—used only by empresses, consorts, and officials.\nThird, the *Yellow Register Retreat*, which aids the living, delivers the dead, and rescues those suffering in the Nine Dark Prisons of the Earth—used by common scholars and the populace.\n\nThe Seven Grades are:\nFirst, the *Three Sovereigns Retreat*, for seeking immortality and protecting the state.\nSecond, the *Natural Retreat*, for cultivating the real and studying the Dao.\nThird, the *Highest Clarity Retreat*, for ascending to emptiness and entering the subtle.\nFourth, the *Instruction Retreat*, for averting disasters and healing illnesses.\nFifth, the *Mud and Ashes Retreat*, for repenting transgressions and requesting life.\nSixth, the *Illuminating the Real Retreat*, for delivering the souls of the Nine Dark Prisons.\nSeventh, the *Three Primes Retreat*, for repenting sins before the Three Officials.\n\nThese various retreats may last one day and one night, three days and three nights, or seven days and seven nights, all in accordance with the ritual models. In all cases, they have their basis.\n\nThus, when exiting *qian* and entering *xun*, there are incantations for both exit and entry. When visualizing spirits and concentrating on the real, there are methods for both visualization and concentration. Whether sounding the ritual drum, contemplating the circular image, or summoning the attending guards and envoys of communication, one must be clear about the direction from which they emerge. When invoking the Supreme Perfected’s life-generating qi, one must manifest the place into which it enters.\n\nThe Dao resides in the human heart, yet external petitions are still necessary. Since one cannot yet achieve profound union, one must make it manifest through action. The human heart has no form, yet when set in motion, it creates boundaries. When boundaries are purified, the heart becomes clear; when the heart is clear, conduct becomes pure; when conduct is pure, one can commune with the spirits; when the heart is clear, one can comprehend the Dao of Heaven. Therefore, ascending the altar to make vows, presenting yellow petitions, and submitting memorials ensure that both heart and form are fully expressed, allowing the human and the divine to unite.\n\nI have heard it said: \"Ten thousand scrolls of cinnabar script are not as good as guarding the One.\" I also say: Ten thousand regulations and teachings are not as good as guarding the One. If one knows how to guard the One, then one can trace the branches to investigate the root, and from the coarse enter the refined. Otherwise, merely adorning the exterior with clamorous and ornate displays is like child’s play—one only drifts further from the Dao! How then can one penetrate the real and comprehend the numinous?\n\nLin Boqian asked: What about the rituals of offering?\n\nThe Patriarch replied: In ancient times, the way of communing with the divine placed sincerity and reverence first. Later generations, lacking sufficient sincerity and reverence, prepared objects to serve as ritual implements. If one were truly sincere and could prepare the objects, it might still be acceptable. Yet when the objects are not even prepared, the disrespect is extreme!\n\nThe scriptures say: \"One may offer water and present flowers—what need is there for other things?\" The scriptures also say: \"Imitating worldly etiquette and dignity\"—thus, all the offerings of today are sufficient if they are without shame. Otherwise, they are all irreverent—how can one not be warned?\n\nThe *Dushi* says: According to the *Jade Standards and Heavenly Statutes*, when setting up an offering, one must not present paper money to the Highest Perfected—this is a grave act of disrespect. Though there were funerary objects in ancient times, there was no paper money. Only by the end of the Han dynasty did paper money appear, and it was used to sacrifice to the ghosts and spirits of the middle and lower realms. How can it be used to offer to the Celestial Perfected?\n\nThose in the world who are greedy for profit, even when their bodies have passed through the Great Yin, retain a single念. As the *Ten Thousand Lights Repentance* says: \"What is lacking or deficient are all worldly treasures.\" Thus, the burning of paper money is meant to break this念.\n\nIt is further said: Among the regulations and teachings, there is a section on lighting lamps, which states that the Dipper revolves in the center of Heaven, truly governing the fortunes and misfortunes of humanity, and holding the power over life and death. Therefore, one must urgently submit a petition—there is none who does not respond.\n\nShould one have the means to conduct a jiao offering, one ought to follow the rites of the Esoteric Jiao or the Hetu Jiao, supplicating according to one’s heartfelt prayers. Yet today, there are those who light lamps for the birthdays of temple deities, or who vow to light lamps due to illness—truly unaware of the profound efficacy of lighting lamps.\n\nThe Patriarch said: In this world, all transmit the name of the \"Dong An,\" yet none know the reason for its name. According to ancient regulations, the altar was adorned with vermilion and bore the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures, hence called the *Dong An*. All memorials and petitions were presented before it. Now, however, it is otherwise: merely a table is set, unadorned with vermilion—this may still pass; and precious offerings of texts are placed upon it—this, too, may pass. Yet worse, miscellaneous objects are heaped upon it, some taken from it to offer incense, others to recite invocations, all under the pretext of bringing them closer to the imperial presence. Yet Heaven hears from on high, and no voice is too distant to reach it. If one claims proximity to the imperial presence ensures reception, then are all other petitions truly unheard? How can one not know that the vastness of the void is filled with spirits, and that a single thought, once arisen, is known throughout the Three Realms—what distinction is there between far and near, high and low?\n\nIt is further said: At the beginning of the jiao rites, the rite of *chi shui* (commanding water) is performed to dispel impurities. Later generations, clinging to tradition without change, perform this purification only after three or nine days, at the start of the jiao. If so, then during those three or nine days, impurities remain undispelled—how can one then approach the Perfected? If one argues that once the images are arranged, no defilement remains, why then use *chi shui* at the start of the jiao? In my view, *chi shui* should be performed at the very beginning of all rites. When the environment is purified, the mind becomes clear; when the mind is clear, conduct is pure; when conduct is pure, one may commune with the spirits; and when the mind is clear, one may align with the Dao of Heaven. After commanding the water, one proceeds in order: offering incense, inviting the masters, and approaching the Perfected.\n\nZihu Xie Xiandao asked: What is the essential principle of *gang bu* (the Pace of Yu)?\n\nThe Preceptor replied: I have heard from my master that, in general, *gang bu* is mostly based on the five-step system of mutual generation and restriction, stepping like a cat or dog crouching like a snake. Advance five steps, retreat five steps; advance seven, retreat seven. The four directions follow the numbers of the Five Phases’ generation and completion. Only after assuming the serpent’s crouch may one strike. Observe how one stalks a mouse—it is the same. Thus it is said: \"The shaman’s step is Yu’s step; Yu’s step is but five, yet it harmonizes the Five Phases, and with long practice, one ascends.\" Such is the case with the methods of the Eight Gates of Dunjia, Taiyi Liuren, and Gu Xu—all fundamentally rely on the manifestation of the step.\n\nNowadays, people tread upon the *kui* and tread upon the Dipper, yet how many know the great prohibitions that remain? As the scriptures say: \"If you wish to ascend to the Perfected, do not offend the Perfected One.\" The Perfected One is the third star. It is also said: \"If you wish to summon the spirits, do not block the Gate of Heaven.\" The Gate of Heaven is the Wenqu Star.\n\nIn all methods of stepping the Dipper, one must strictly avoid violating the celestial principles or transgressing the stellar regulations. If the feet cross horizontally, this is called \"violating the celestial principles\"; if the feet advance mistakenly, this is called \"transgressing the stellar regulations.\" Should such violations occur, one must immediately bow at the head of the star and offer an apology—thus may it be resolved.\n\nZiju Zhao Mufu asked: \"What is meant by the so-called Yin Dipper and Yang Dipper today?\"\nMaster Du replied: \"I received this teaching from my master: after the Winter Solstice, beginning from *Kui* is the Yang Dipper; after the Summer Solstice, beginning from *Qiao* is the Yin Dipper. Stepping the Yang Dipper first, then the Yin Dipper, is called 'Fire and Water Uncrossed'; stepping the Yin Dipper first, then the Yang Dipper, is called 'Water and Fire Crossed.' Nowadays, people consider starting with the left foot at the initial star and reciting from *Kui* to *Qiao* as the Yang Dipper, while starting with the right foot at the initial star and reciting from *Tan* to *Po* as the Yin Dipper. How mistaken! This is a baseless theory. The *Scripture of Flying Spirits to Visit the Dipper* states: 'Following the sequence is Yang; reversing it is Yin. From *Kui* to *Qiao* is following; from *Qiao* to *Kui* is reversing.' The essential point is simply this: 'If you wish to fly your spirit, do not offend the Perfected One, the third star.' All else is merely the *ding* step.\"\n\nBoqian asked: \"There are said to be five *La* days—what are they?\"\nThe Patriarch replied: \"The first day of the first month is Heavenly *La*, when the Five Emperors convene the Nine *Qi* in the Azure Heaven of the East—this is the day when the Primordial Spirit of the Heavenly Penetrating Capital opens the Yuan at the Supreme August Palace. The fifth day of the fifth month is Earthly *La*, when the Five Emperors convene the Three *Qi* in the Cinnabar Heaven of the South—this is the day when the Great Spirit of Swift Fire and Commanding Decree enters the Jade Clarity Palace of Divine Radiance. The seventh day of the seventh month is the *La* of Virtue and the Dao, when the Five Emperors convene the Seven *Qi* in the White Heaven of the West—this is the day when the Vice Marshal of Heavenly Strategy opens the Yuan to illuminate the Void Palace of Lingxu. The first day of the tenth month is the *La* of the People’s Year, when the Five Emperors convene the Five *Qi* in the Mysterious Heaven of the North—this is the day when the Great Marshal of Assisting Sagacity opens the Yuan at the Scarlet Heavenly Palace of Jingdan. The *La* day in the twelfth month is the *La* of Kings and Lords, when the Five Emperors convene the Myriad *Qi* in the Jade Capital of the Upper Realm of Xuandu—this is the day when the Great Marshal of the Dark Warrior opens the Yuan at the Harmonious Migration and Correction Palace. These five days are when the Five Emperors gather and the five spirits first open their palaces—thus they are called the Five *La*.\"\n\nThe Patriarch continued: \"You have long heard of these ancient teachings. In the Han dynasty, Lu Jia served as the Jade Clarity Primordial Beginning Dharma Master, presiding over the immortals and perfected beings and governing the affairs of the Yellow Register Court.\"\n\nMoreover, Xin Hanchen now serves as Commander of the Thunder Bureau, a fierce official with fangs like wolf’s teeth. Tao Hongjing of the Jin dynasty now oversees the Water Bureau of Penglai as its Inspector. Chu Suiliang of the Tang is now a Messenger of the Five Thunders. Yan Zhenqing now serves as Left Judge of the North Polar Expulsion-of-Evil Court, while Li Yangbing is its Right Judge. Li Bai is now the Pure and Leisurely Perfected of the Eastern Florescence Upper Clarity Bureau. Bai Letian is now the Long-lived Immortal Master of Penglai.\n\nAmong the female immortals, Wei Huacun of the Jin is now the Purple Void Primordial Lady, ranking among the Immortal Lords. Xie Ziran of the Tang is now the Perfected of the Eastern Ultimate. What manner of persons were these? How can one fail to emulate them?\n\nThe text further states: According to the *Divine Empyrean Jade Register*, one is called a \"Primordial Destiny Perfected\" when practicing the Orthodox Unity Dao, thereby refining one’s own primordial destiny to attain its truth. How can the common and vulgar take \"Perfected\" as an official title, brazenly misusing it—even to the point of submitting it in memorials? One must examine oneself and reflect: does one’s cultivation truly embody the conduct of a Perfected? If one lacks such conduct yet presumptuously adopts the title, the sin extends to nine generations, and Heaven’s pardon does not apply. One may only be called \"Recipient of Such-and-Such Dharma Transmission,\" with lower ranks termed \"Dharma Titles.\" Those without transmission titles are considered lay disciples upon ordination.\n\nXiandao asked: \"Recently, I have heard of the *Yuantong* Dharma and have privately doubted it. Its talismanic seal is round on the outside and square within, with the Five Phases at its center and the Eight Trigrams surrounding it. The provincial and prefectural bureaus are arrayed at the four directions, taking the four characters *Lingbao Yuantong* as its宗 and *Hunhua Xuanmi* as its root. It cobbles together various talismans, diagrams, incantations, and mudras into a single system, calling itself the *Great Yuantong Dharma*. Does the Perfected Master approve of this?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"The spirit has no fixed form, hence it is called *yuan* (round); *qi* has no fixed substance, hence it is called *tong* (penetrating). The ancient teaching of *yuantong* refers to the blending of spirit and *qi*, emerging and entering the formless, returning to primordial chaos. If one now reduces it to shapes, instruments, trigrams, and numbers, how far removed is this from the true *yuantong*?\"\n\nThe Patriarch said: \"The Celestial Master of Han once declared: 'If one can purify the six senses and still the square inch of the heart, practicing this over time, one may sit and command ghosts and spirits, summoning wind and rain.' Yet today’s students of the Dharma do not root themselves in the Dao or trace their lineage to the heart. Each becomes his own master, each household its own school. They regard spirit-attachment as marvelous and dream-visions as sublime. The officers they summon number in the hundreds and thousands, while the Dharma ranks they confer include 'Perfected' and 'Envoys.' Some mix shamanic techniques with orthodox methods; others claim secret transmissions from spirit-writing. When questioned, they reply that it accords with the statutes; when challenged, they insist it is true transmission. Alas! The errors of false masters are not the fault of sentient beings—one blind man leads the blind, delusion begets delusion. How lamentable!\"\n\nDushi, discussing the matter of talismanic water with Zishu, remarked: \"Those who seek it are not always devout; some merely test it. Even so, I test them in return by granting their request, yet it often proves ineffective.\"\n\nThe Patriarch, upon hearing this, said: \"One must not respond to their pretense with sincerity. Whether it proves efficacious or not is another matter.\"\n\nThe Patriarch further declared: \"Do not ask whether it is numinous or not, whether it is efficacious or not. Simply act as the hand moves, without entertaining any thoughts.\"\n\nDushi said to Boqian: \"Your Patriarch presided over the Azure Mushroom Retreat; I now oversee the Crane Forest Retreat; you currently govern the Purple Radiance Retreat. In general, those who uphold the Dharma must establish a site for incense offerings and petition for the name of a retreat. Such was the case with the Celestial Master of Han’s Twenty-Four Treaties, the ancient Thirty-Six Retreat Huts, and Xu Jingyang’s Seven Retreats. The statutes of retreats and treaties state: 'For lay households, it is called a *jing* (retreat); for masters, it is called a *zhi* (treaty).'\"\n\nThe Patriarch said: \"The establishment of altars and the holding of jiao rites are, in essence, one and the same. When discussing this, one might say: 'On such a day, Heaven is free of floating dust, the Four *Qi* shine clearly, rivers and seas are still, mountains and peaks swallow mist, the sun and moon cease their motion, the celestial pivot halts its wheel. Above and below are opened and connected, the Two Modes harmoniously interact.' At such a time, the hundred spirits and host of Perfecteds gather in hidden communion. Thus, during the jiao rites, this is the ideal state. Yet when presenting memorials and invoking the Perfecteds, even if the weather is not so perfect, resonance may still occur. If the purpose is to deliver the deceased and ferry souls, it may require overcast and rain. If the aim is to dispel calamities and avert misfortune, it may require clear skies. All jiao rites are conducted accordingly.\"\n\nDushi said to Xiandao: \"I once heard from my master: 'Laozi has Three Treasures: first, compassion; second, frugality; third, not daring to put oneself first in the world.' Xu Jingyang has Eight Treasures: loyalty, filial piety, integrity, prudence, magnanimity, tolerance, and forbearance. Lü Dongbin has Four Treasures: first, no recklessness; second, no greed; third, utmost sincerity; fourth, holding to the One. Chen Niewan has Five Treasures: first, wisdom; second, trustworthiness; third, benevolence; fourth, courage; fifth, solemnity. To adapt to circumstances with many changes, leaving others unable to fathom one’s intentions, is called wisdom. To focus the mind and hold steadfastly to the One without wavering is called trustworthiness. To aid others and benefit things, always acting with leniency and forgiveness, is called benevolence. To act decisively and maintain a resolute heart is called courage. To refrain from frivolous speech, carrying oneself with gravity and restraint, is called solemnity.\n\nThe Eastern Barbarian Thunder is benevolent, capable of wind and rain, nurturing the myriad things. The Southern Barbarian Thunder is courageous, clarifying commands, rewarding good and punishing evil. The Western Barbarian Thunder is solemn, restraining primordial *qi* and striking with thunder to rouse all beings. The Northern Barbarian Thunder is wise, lying hidden in the Kan position, rising when the time is right. The Central Barbarian Thunder is trustworthy, lying dormant through the four seasons, never issuing commands recklessly.\"\n\nThis is the marvel of mind-to-mind transmission. Within the real resides the divine; beyond sincerity, there is no method.\n\nThe Patriarch said: A piece of wood the size of a handspan, placed upon the ground, allows a person to tread upon it with ease, yet a piece of wood the size of a square foot, placed at the end of a pole, causes a person to hesitate and falter. It is not that the objects differ in size, but rather that the mind harbors emptiness or fullness.\n\nWhen a fierce tiger strides, the grasses and trees lie flat; when a venomous snake rages, the earth and stones are overturned. This is because when the spirit is whole, its power is great, and when essence is complete, its *qi* is mighty.\n\nThe archer who resembles a tiger sees only the tiger and not the stone; the one who slays the violent flood-dragon sees only the dragon and not the water. At such moments, the eyes see what they should not see, and the ears hear what they should not hear—this is the way of employing spirit through form.\n\nWhen the mind does not doubt the hand, and the hand does not doubt the brush, only after forgetting both hand and brush does one grasp the way of calligraphy.\n\nTo sweep away filth, one must summon the *qi* of the Five Emperors; to subdue vipers, one must command the essence of the Five Stars. If the summoned and commanded do not arrive, how can one accomplish anything?\n\nSpirit is like a mother, and *qi* is like a child. To summon *qi* with spirit is to summon a child with its mother—how could it dare not come?\n\nMaster Du said: There was once a poem by a high monk:\n*A pond of lotus leaves, endless as robes,*\n*A few pines with yellow needles, food in abundance.*\n*Just as the world learns of my dwelling,*\n*This mountain monk moves his abode again.*\n\nLater, a cultivator of immortality also composed a quatrain:\n*When hungry, I dine on the saliva beneath my tongue and am full;*\n*When cold, the fire from my cinnabar field warms me.*\n*I carry with me a poor man’s livelihood—*\n*Better to seek within myself than to seek from others.*\n\nThese two poems may serve to slightly purify the turbid schemes of body and speech.\n\nThe Patriarch said: The cultivator of the real establishes resolve with sincerity, conducts affairs with bitter perseverance, penetrates insight with concentrated thought, and forgets the self to merge with the true.\n\nIf one can do this, the scripture says: *The cosmos is in your hands, the myriad transformations are within your body.* It also says: *If a person can always remain pure and still, heaven and earth will all return to them.*\n\nThe world may not understand this, but if one can attain stillness amid clamor, clarity amid turbidity, view all with equanimity, and sever all thoughts—moving without obstruction, obtaining the great elixir of peace—this is called the Dao.\n\nIf not, gazing at the stars and worshipping the Dipper may suffice; reciting scriptures and chanting incantations may also suffice. I know not which is better!\n\nHe also said: I have heard from my former master that the ancient immortals and sagely worthies transmitted teachings mouth-to-mouth, without relying on written words. Now, in this world, I record them in writing. Those who awaken may transmit the sagely way; without awakening, there is no attainment—those who awaken attain for themselves.\n\nTo attain the sagely way is to be without past or present. Its departure is not of the past, its arrival is not of the present. What can be transmitted is called the affair, not the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally untransmittable; the Dao has no sound or color, no form or appearance, no past or present, no coming or going.\n\nHe also said: Performing rituals is like serving as an official; cultivating the Dao is like living in seclusion.\n\nAnother day, a guest asked about the Twelve Divine Officials, and so an explanation was provided:\n\nThe Celestial Stem of *Tiangang* belongs to *chen* (辰). *Chen*, *xu* (戌), *chou* (丑), and *wei* (未) are called the Four Uprights, as they belong to earth and reside in the center, hence the name Four Uprights. The character *gang* (罡) is composed of *si* (四, four) and *zheng* (正, upright), and since *chen* is earth, this divine official is called *Tiangang*.\n\n*Taiyi* belongs to *si* (巳). *Si* is the Gate of Thunder, also called the Gate of Wind. The Water Mouth is also the position of the Nine Heavens’ *Taiyi* Ten Spirits, hence this divine official is called *Taiyi*.\n\n*Shenguang* belongs to *wu* (午). *Wu* is the brilliance of *li* (離), not originally *Shenguang* but *Tengguang* (腾光, soaring light).\n\n*Xiaoji* belongs to *wei* (未), and *Daji* belongs to *chou* (丑), both noble spirits of heaven. *Jia* (甲), *wu* (戊), and *geng* (庚) are the Three Celestial Marvels, and since oxen and sheep are esteemed, *Daji* and *Xiaoji* are both auspicious spirits.\n\n*Chuansong* belongs to *shen* (申). *Shen* is *kun* (坤), and *kun* is the Earth Gate. The Earth Gate is clouds, which gather clouds above in the heavens, hence the name *Chuansong* (传送, transmitting messages).\n\n*Congkui* belongs to *you* (酉). The *cong* (从) is pronounced in the falling tone, meaning \"to follow.\" It is so named because it resides beside *xu* (戌) and *kui* (魁), hence *Congkui* (从魁, following *Kui*).\n\n*Hekui* belongs to *xu* (戌). *Xu* and *hai* (亥) are the source of the Milky Way, and *xu* is the Celestial River, hence this spirit is named *Hekui* (河魁, River Chief).\n\n*Dengming* belongs to *hai* (亥). *Hai* is the Heavenly Gate.\n\n*Shenhou* belongs to *zi* (子). *Zi* belongs to *kan* (坎), and *kan* is the Yin Queen, the Heavenly Queen, hence *Shenhou* (神后, Divine Queen).\n\n*Yin* (寅) is *Gongcao*. *Yin* is *gen* (艮), and *kun* (坤) and *gen* are both earth. *Gen* is the mountain, *kun* is the earth, and as mountains and marshes communicate *qi*, *gen* and *kun* gather clouds. Thus, *yin* and *shen* (申) are the divine officials of *Gongcao* (功曹) and *Chuansong* (传送).\n\n*Dachong* belongs to *mao* (卯). *Mao* is thunder, and the thunder spirit is called *Tianchong* (天冲, Celestial Thrust). As the *Scripture of Salvation* says: *Hurl fire ten thousand miles like lightning, let the flowing bells resound like the Eight Thrusting Thunders.*\n\nThough these are the Twelve Divine Officials, they are in truth the aides-de-camp of the Heavenly Emperor.\n\n*End of the Second Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of Master Haiqiong the White Realized One*\n\n*Beginning of the Third Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of Master Haiqiong the White Realized One*\n\nThe disciples Yanhu Ye Guxi and others recorded this:\n\n**Ascending the Hall at Mount Wu Yi**\n\nThis single stick of incense—\nits sprouts budded before the division of primordial chaos,\nits branches and leaves flourished at the dawn of the Dragon Han kalpa.\nWhere yin and yang are not yet, earth-dragons coil and tiger-crouch;\nbeyond the bounds of heaven and earth, rain scatters and wind blows.\nOn Kunlun’s peak, the medicine bears no flowers;\nby the Hua Chi’s waters, the tree casts no shadow.\nThick smoke is not of color, yet it suffuses the Gate of the Supreme Clarity’s crown;\nauspicious mist makes no sound, yet it transforms into the nostrils of the Primordial Beginning.\nWhen raised, demons’ guts shatter;\nwhen kindled, the pipes stir and winds wail.\nOnly then does one realize:\nŚākyamuni himself planted and tended it,\nConfucius, without intent, passed it by—\nthe undivided *qi* of the Great Ultimate,\nthe deathless root of empty space.\n\nNow, burning it in the censer,\nwe reverently offer it to the former sages and former masters,\nto those who speak and exhale the Dao.\nWe pray above for the One Man’s felicity,\nthat the ten thousand states may all be at peace,\nthe Six Treasuries perfectly ordered,\nthe Hundred Offices timely and harmonious.\nMay all within heaven and earth become the sacred precincts of the Great Net,\nmay every mountain and river be transformed into the Jade Capital of the Dark Metropolis.\n\nIf there be any true Dao-seekers,\nany lofty scholars who know constancy,\nwhose knots of doubt remain uncut,\nwhose locks of wisdom stay unopened—\nlet them see with the same single eye as sages and commoners,\nlet the wise and foolish alike open their thirty tongues to ask.\n\nThis is what is meant by:\narraying the Three Mysteries’ halberds and armor,\ndeploying the Eight Extremes’ bows and spears.\nTo see what is right and not act—\nwhat courage is there in that?\n\n**Tian Gu asked:** The Great Dao originally has no name—why then are there lead and mercury?\n\n**The Master replied:** That which reveals the form of the formless is the Dao’s dragon and tiger;\nthat which discloses the name of the nameless is the Dao’s lead and mercury.\n\n**He further asked:** Among the five metals, silver is extracted from lead; among the eight stones, mercury is drawn from cinnabar. How does this apply to the refinement of the inner elixir?\n\n**The Master replied:** The silver within lead, the mercury within cinnabar—\nthe heart within the body, the yang within yin.\n\n**Xue Yan asked:** Medicinal substances have floating and sinking, clarity and turbidity;\nfire phases have withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat.\nTheir operation lies in host and guest,\ntheir flourishing and waning in punishment and virtue.\nHow is this principle to be understood?\n\n**The Master replied:** All day long one gathers the great medicine—\nwhere does one distinguish floating from sinking?\nAll day long one tends the fire phase—\nwho knows advance from retreat?\nWhen the Five Agents are complete, there is no mutual conquest;\nwhen the Four Images are harmonized, there is no host or guest.\n\n**He further asked:** The waxing and waning crescents, the metal count and water count—\ntwo eights make sixteen, forming one catty.\nFrom which direction is the medicine gathered?\nIn which place is it refined?\n\n**The Master replied:** The waxing crescent is the metal count, the waning crescent the water count—\ngather one catty, refine one catty.\n\n**Xi Weng asked:** What you have taught is the Great Dao itself,\nyet what your disciples transmit is the study of the golden elixir.\nI do not yet understand: are the Great Dao and the golden elixir the same or different?\n\n**The Master replied:** To cross the river, one needs a raft;\nupon reaching the shore, the boat is no longer required.\n\n**He further asked:** In the study of the golden elixir,\nthe medicinal substances come first,\nand the operation of the medicinal substances depends on the fire phase as essential.\nWhat are the medicinal substances?\nWhat is the fire phase?\n\n**The Master replied:** The medicinal substances are yang within yin;\nthe fire phase is yin within yang.\nGrasp the purport of yin and yang,\nand the great medicine is fully expounded in one place.\n\n**Gu An asked:** True lead, true mercury,\ntrue tiger, true dragon—\nwhat are these things?\nDing Gong, the Yellow Dame,\nthe Infant, the Radiant Maiden—\nwhat are their uses?\n\n**The Master replied:** If you understand the original Three-Two-One,\nif not, you remain with the old One-Two-Three.\n\n**He further asked:** Lead originally belongs to the north—why is it called \"metal lead\"?\nMercury originally belongs to the south—why is it called \"wood mercury\"?\n\n**The Master replied:** The maiden dons a blue robe,\nthe young lord wears a white silk sash.\n\n**Xiao Quan asked:** The dragon’s roar, the tiger’s howl—\nthese are not between mouth and nose;\nthe husband’s chant, the wife’s response—\nthese are not within heart and kidneys.\nIf mercury is not *li*, lead is not *kan*,\n*dui* is not the tiger, *zhen* is not the dragon—\nthen where, amid this maze of confusion, may I seek the elixir’s secret?\n\n**The Master replied:** Do not idly imagine *kan* and *li* as heart and kidneys,\ndo not vainly seek *zhen* and *dui* in lungs and liver.\nOnce you comprehend the two words yin and yang,\nnaturally the husband and wife, tiger and dragon, will coil together.\n\n**He further asked:** Saliva, nasal mucus, essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and humors—\nZhongli Quan says these belong to yin.\nNasal mucus, saliva, essence, blood, brain, *qi*, and spirit—\nWang Ding’s mercury is the Seven Returns.\nHow is this principle to be understood?\n\n**The Master replied:** Only when you quarry stone do you meet jade.\n\n**Mo An asked:** Before the golden elixir is completed, how can there be dragon and tiger?\nAfter the golden elixir is completed, how can there be no dragon and tiger?\n\n**The Master replied:** At first, there is a thing yet no one recognizes it;\nin the end, there is no form yet it is known where it abides.\n\n**He further asked:** The whole hall is filled with guests—\nwho is the master?\n\n**The Master replied:** One word, two words—weighty indeed;\neven a thousand sages cannot bear it.\n\n**Yan Hu asked:** The Way of the golden elixir—\nin the *Yi*, it is *qian* and *kun*, *kan* and *li*;\nin heaven, it is the Dipper and the Winnowing Basket, sun and moon;\nin the elixir, it is dragon and tiger, water and fire;\nin the medicine, it is lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury;\nin man, it is husband and wife, male and female—\nall reduced to the two words yin and yang.\nI have already understood this!\nBut what is meant by the \"true soil of the Great Ultimate\"?\n\n**The Master replied:** A thousand peaks rise until they reach the mountains’ edge and halt;\nten thousand crashing sounds return to the sea and vanish.\n\n**Qianyun asked:** For one who wishes to refine the golden elixir, one must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, deeply fathom the workings of creation, then pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path, unite the three natures within the Primordial Palace, gather the five phases, and harmonize the four images. What, then, is the essence of the golden elixir?\n\n**The Master replied:** \"Gold\" is heaven’s release of its killing mechanism;\n\"elixir\" is emptiness containing form.\n\n**He further asked:** The Great Dao is originally without thing—how can it be compared?\n\n**The Master answered:** To speak of rivers does not quench thirst.\n\n**He further asked:** The Great Dao is fundamentally one principle—why then are there distinctions?\n\n**The Master answered:** To draw a cake does not satisfy hunger.\n\n**He further asked:** May this be likened to jade still hidden in stone, suddenly gleaming today?\n\n**The Master answered:** The pure wind and bright moon—both sages and commoners partake of their grace.\n\n**Chigang said:**\nThe Great Dao is formless, the great elixir colorless;\nin movement, stillness; in stillness, movement—movement and stillness are thus.\nWithout, there is being; within being, there is nothing—being and nothingness are silent.\nIf you grasp this, there is fundamentally no delusion or awakening;\nif you fail to grasp it, the eye sees only sages and mortals.\nThus, Wei Boyang’s \"river earth\" and \"mysterious maiden,\"\nXu Jingsun’s \"iron boat upon the water,\"\nZhongli Quan’s \"golden liquid returning elixir,\"\nLiu Haichan’s \"true water of jade essence\"—\nall are like the moon’s waxing and waning, never leaving the water,\nor clouds dispersing and gathering, never obstructing the sky.\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThus, in former times, the Perfected One Xue of Piling fully penetrated the great matter of the Chan school, only to have the Perfected One of Apricot Grove pierce his nostrils—so it is said, a thousand emptinesses cannot trade for one reality.\nZhang Ziyang said: \"All day walking, yet never walked; all day sitting, yet never sat.\" One may pity the child who does not recognize its own ugliness.\nToday, has anyone in your walking and sitting encountered the *Wuzhen pian*?\nEven if you have encountered the *Wuzhen pian*, you still may not recognize Zhang Pingshu.\nAll of you, like fish drinking water, know its warmth or coolness for yourselves—do you understand how the Perfected One Xue, having already mastered Chan, could yet bow his head to the golden elixir’s crucible?\nIf you pierce through this, there is no second Dao under heaven, no two minds in the sage.\nIf you fail to pierce through, then call your attendant once—when the attendant responds, the Master asks: \"Did you eat congee this morning?\"\nThe attendant replies: \"I ate congee.\"\nThe Master says: \"Good things do not fill a man’s belly.\"\n\n**At the Pure Offering in Changzhou, after the incense was offered, the Master said:**\nClouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger;\nmountains echo valleys, sound matches shadow—if you are a true listener, why fear revelation?\n\nA monk asked: \"Our teacher, Śākyamuni Buddha, was once the Immortal of Forbearance—how does being an immortal compare to being a buddha?\"\n\n**The Master answered:** Water flowing from beside the stone is cold;\nwind passing through the flowers is fragrant.\n\nThe monk continued: \"Then why does the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* say the ten kinds of immortals do not attain true awakening? What of that?\"\n\n**The Master answered:** The red wheel shines brilliantly—what can it do for the upturned basin?\n\nThe monk continued: \"Why did Fu Dashi say, 'Though one passes through eighty thousand kalpas, in the end one falls into emptiness and perishes'?\"\n\n**The Master answered:** All that is conditioned is illusion; only the formless is true.\n\nThe monk continued: \"Are the Four-Fruit Immortals and the Five-Penetration Immortals the same or different?\"\n\n**The Master answered:** All faces are alike—it is man who makes them so.\n\nThe monk continued: \"Ultimately, how do immortals compare to prajñā?\"\n\n**The Master answered:** True silk does not exchange for gold.\n\nThe monk continued: \"Then what of the differences between the Old Barbarian and Old Cong—who is superior?\"\n\n**The Master answered:** In the end, water must flow to the sea;\nin the end, clouds must seek the mountains to return.\n\nThe monk continued: \"If so, then a single drop of ink makes dragons in two places.\"\n\n**The Master answered:** The goose-king selects milk—pure, not of the duck-kind.\n\nThe monk continued: \"Does this allow a true adept to break through the barriers here?\"\n\n**The Master answered:** The shrimp leaps but cannot escape the dipper.\n\nThe monk bowed in reverence.\n\nA Daoist asked: \"To know the fire’s timing and its mysterious workings, one must discuss it in detail with the immortals.\"\n\n**The Master answered:** I have heard of Pan riding his donkey backward.\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"The sovereign’s fire, the minister’s fire, the people’s fire, the wildfire, the celestial fire, the mao-you fire, the Big Dipper’s fire—ultimately, what is the fire-timing of the Great Elixir?\"\n\n**The Master answered:** The golden crow sinks in the west;\nthe jade hare rises in the east.\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"The sages transmit the medicine but not the fire.\"\n\n**The Master answered:** Do not blame the heavenly mechanism for leaking—\nit is all because scholars are greatly deluded.\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"When sentient beings have not awakened, how does one point out their delusion?\"\n\n**The Master answered:** Have you seen the tongueless man speak?\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"If so, then in the beginning, all those who worked at it saw it, but only when it comes to non-doing do the many begin to know.\"\n\n**The Master answered:** Within the indistinct, they meet;\nwithin the boundless, there is transformation.\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"Is this what is meant by ‘with ashen heart, one treads water and fire; within stillness, one gathers true lead’?\"\n\n**The Master answered:** The white deer can fly in its steps;\nthe dark turtle understands how to secure its form.\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"From this, one knows that within the medicine there is fire, and within the fire there is medicine.\"\n\n**The Master answered:** What is your honorable surname, my friend?\n\nThe Daoist did not answer, bowed, and departed.\n\nA Daoist priest asked: \"I have heard that the Golden Elixir and Great Medicine have three thousand six hundred gates, and that there are dozens of schools for nurturing life. Yet if the Great Dao is untransmittable, is there ultimately something that resembles it?\"\n\n**The Master answered:** Yes.\n\nThe Daoist priest continued: \"What of the principle of the twin passes at the spine?\"\n\nThe Master answered: \"The head droops, the back bends—one stretch and life is pitied.\"\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"How does one silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor?\"\nThe Master answered: \"Exhausting one’s gaze to fix upon the crown of the head—when has one ever dreamt of the Great Return Elixir?\"\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"What of the flying golden essence behind the elbow?\"\nThe Master answered: \"Do not mistake fireflies for the light of Mount Sumeru.\"\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"When the two luminaries gather in the Hall of Brightness, what then?\"\nThe Master answered: \"What is so extraordinary between the brows? Why not turn the mind inward to illumine the Crimson Palace?\"\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"From the mud pill above to the coccyx below, with the three fields in between—where lies the marvel?\"\nThe Master answered: \"To depart from all extremes is called the marvelous Dao.\"\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"Is this a matter of visualization?\"\nThe Master answered: \"No.\"\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"Rinsing and swallowing, pressing and massaging, contemplation and retention, breath-holding and constriction—what is the ultimate outcome?\"\nThe Master answered: \"The ten-thousand-year pines of Mount Nanyue would split with laughter.\"\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"What *is* it, then?\"\nThe Master answered: \"Eating rice and shitting—what is so difficult?\"\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"Is the Dao to be found in true yin and true yang?\"\nThe Master answered: \"If one can abide in constant clarity and stillness, heaven and earth all return to them.\"\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"Why is it that whether moving with or against the current, heaven cannot fathom it, and whether right or wrong, people do not recognize you?\"\nThe Master answered: \"One chant, one drunkenness, one grain of the elixir.\"\n\nThe Daoist continued: \"This may be said to be within everyone’s reach, each one perfected.\"\nThe Master answered: \"Do not mistake yellow mud for gold.\"\n\nThe Daoist bowed in reverence.\n\nA scholar asked: \"That which cannot be seen is called *xī*; that which cannot be heard is called *yí*. Setting aside *xī* and *yí*, what is meant by ‘gazing upward, ever higher’?\"\nThe Master answered: \"A cloth towel at the tip of a hundred-foot pole.\"\n\nThe scholar continued: \"What of ‘boring into it, ever harder’?\"\nThe Master answered: \"Clearly inscribed at the wine shop’s spring sign.\"\n\nThe scholar continued: \"And when it appears before one?\"\nThe Master answered: \"To meet and not drink—one returns empty-handed.\"\n\nThe scholar continued: \"What if it suddenly appears behind?\"\nThe Master answered: \"Even the peach blossoms in the grotto laugh at such a one.\"\n\nThe scholar continued: \"And when the thought is fixed upon it?\"\nThe Master answered: \"The noble person guards their solitude—never for a moment may it be parted from.\"\n\nThe scholar continued: \"This is what is meant by ‘all day like a fool.’\"\nThe Master answered: \"In the jar, one need not fear the turtle’s escape.\"\n\nThe scholar bowed in reverence.\n\nThe Master then raised his whisk, drew a circle, and said: \"Three questions, three unanswered; four questions, four unknown. Now, wasting words and breath—it would make the five Mount Sumerus split with laughter.\"\n\nThe Master continued: \"Earlier, a monk asked whether the Four Fruits Immortal and the Five Penetrations Immortal are the same or different. Such a question is peculiar to its time—do any of you now understand the principle of the Five Penetrations and Four Fruits?\n\nThe Five Penetrations: fish caught in a net;\nThe Four Fruits: rabbits running to market.\nHow laughable are those who covet the journey—\nthey return home without ever arriving.\n\nFive Penetrations, ah! Four Fruits,\nThe *bǐng-dīng* lad comes seeking fire.\nA bride rides a donkey, led by her former household—\nlike a monkey watching a water mill.\"\n\nHe struck his staff once, descended from the seat, and the assembly at Mount Lu rose.\n\nThe Master ascended the seat and declared:\n\"In the past, there was no Śākyamuni;\nin the future, there shall be no Maitreya.\nThis bewilders all under heaven—\nonly a thief knows another thief.\"\n\nA Daoist stepped forward and said:\n\"To see what is right and not act—\nwhere is the courage in that?\"\n\nThe Master replied:\n\"I thought you were a cold, hairy creature.\"\n\nThe Daoist bowed in reverence.\n\nThe Master asked:\n\"If you truly have doubts,\nwhy not ask further?\"\n\nThe Daoist inquired:\n\"What is the Supreme First Principle?\"\n\nThe Master answered:\n\"Swiftly, swiftly, as in the command of the law.\"\n\nThe Daoist said:\n\"This bewilders all under heaven.\"\n\nThe Master replied:\n\"Were it not for the Five Lakes lacking Fan Li,\nhow would the staff and cane be bestowed upon King Wu?\"\n\nThe Daoist asked:\n\"The *Scripture of Purity* states the Great Dao is formless—\nwhy then does it give birth to heaven and earth?\"\n\nThe Master answered:\n\"One night, the moon rises over the sea—\nhow many households lean upon their towers?\"\n\nThe Daoist asked:\n\"The Great Dao is without emotion—\nwhy then does it set the sun and moon in motion?\"\n\nThe Master replied:\n\"Clouds come, and the mountain wears a hat;\nwind rises, and the trees shake their heads.\"\n\nThe Daoist asked:\n\"If so, why does the nameless Dao\nyet nourish the ten thousand things?\nHow is this principle to be understood?\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"Though no wind stirs, the lotus leaves sway—\nsurely fish are moving beneath.\"\n\nThe Daoist asked:\n\"Why does heaven tilt toward the northwest?\"\n\nThe Master answered:\n\"Nüwa knit her brows in frustration.\"\n\nThe Daoist asked:\n\"Why does the earth sink in the southeast?\"\n\nThe Master replied:\n\"Great indeed is ignorance of the source.\"\n\nThe Daoist asked:\n\"Fish take water as their life—\nwhy then do they die within it?\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"At journey’s end, frost comes by night;\nthe traveler’s path crosses before the inn’s gate.\"\n\nThe Master added:\n\"If you doubt, observe the tides’ ebb and flow.\"\n\nThe Daoist asked:\n\"Are there not thirteen kinds of death?\"\n\nThe Master replied:\n\"Why not also watch the moon’s waxing and waning?\"\n\nThe Daoist asked:\n\"Are there not also thirteen paths to death through action?\"\n\nThe Master answered:\n\"Six dice cast—red fills the board.\"\n\nThe Daoist said:\n\"Life and death are weighty matters,\nimpermanence swift—\nwhat then is to be done?\"\n\nThe Master replied:\n\"When the court is virtuous, spring is fair.\"\n\nThe Daoist recited:\n\"Blood shed for the emperor is useless—\nbetter to seal one’s lips and pass the fading spring.\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"Tai Lake spans thirty-six thousand acres.\"\n\nThe Daoist bowed and withdrew.\n\nThe Master then declared:\n\"Questions reach the sea’s transformation into mulberry fields;\nanswers wear away the stone of kalpas—\nyet never once has the Supreme Dao appeared in dreams.\nIn the end, this will make the King of Sounded Words laugh aloud.\nHow then is this to be understood?\nHmph!\"\n\nNo one knows this intent—it makes me recall Nanquan.\n\nThe Master then raised a case:\nThe Five Powers asked the Buddha, \"The Buddha has six powers—why do I have only five?\"\nThe Buddha said, \"Which one do you ask me about?\"\n\nThe Master then remarked:\n\"Great and small Śākyamuni—lightly toyed with by the Five Powers Immortal, truly inviting disaster upon mouth and eyes.\nI ask you all: where is the flaw in the Old Man Śākyamuni?\"\n\nThe Master offered a verse:\nŚākyamuni, the Buddha of scripture, and the Five Powers Immortal—\nhis nostrils still lack half a side.\nLast night at the fourth watch, the mountain spewed forth the moon;\nthe mud ox’s hole stirred the four directions of heaven.\n\nThe Master addressed the assembly:\nFrom birth to death, it is ever this single thread.\nI urge you to strip it away, each returning with pure clarity,\nto become the master, to hold fast,\nunwilling to dwell in cages, unresponsive to calls,\nwith the constant light manifest before you.\nA thousand-fathom cliff stands sheer—\nalone, towering, steep, and sheer,\nperfectly round, radiant and bright.\nLeaping from the precipice, one must willingly take it on.\nRevived after annihilation, deceiving the sovereign is impossible—\ncan you bear the bitterness of thought?\nOnly when one can remain perpetually pure and still\ndo heaven and earth entirely return.\nThus it is said: heaven and earth share my root,\nthe ten thousand things share my body.\nThere is no suffering in the Way of quiescent extinction,\nno action in the supreme task of cessation.\n\nAnd how is this to be expressed?\nOne must not speak of dreams before a fool.\n\nThe Master ascended the hall and said:\nAll you many learners, listen to my proclamation—\nit cannot be known by knowing,\nnor recognized by recognizing.\nIf not let go for long,\nit will be attained in days to come.\n\nThe Master ascended the hall and said:\nGrasp it at once, and you understand;\nif not, then let it rest.\nWhy is this so?\nAfter a long silence, he said:\nThe mouth given by father and mother\nwill never speak for the child.\n\nThe Master ascended the hall and said:\nNothing in the world is difficult—\nit all comes down to the heart’s lack of focus.\nIf there is truly no difficulty,\nwhy then focus the heart?\nIf the heart is not focused,\na lifetime will not suffice.\nWhat is the meaning of this?\nA tiger watches the water mill.\n\nThe Master ascended the hall and said:\nWhen the handless man wishes to throw a punch—what then?\nWhen a filial son mourns his parents—what then?\nWhen a starving dog sees a hot oil pan—what then?\nIf one knows the outcome, come share tea together.\n\nThe Master ascended the hall and said:\nGone without a trace,\npitying yet resenting him.\nThe cries of the cuckoo are heard—\nfalsely saying, \"Better not to return.\"\n\nThe Master ascended the hall and said:\nThe void has blood,\nchaos has bones,\nthorns lie within rotting mud—\ndo you understand?\nSlippery mud, slippery mud.\n\nThe Master ascended the hall and said:\nHearing of it brings wealth and honor,\nseeing it brings poverty and destitution.\nOne says, \"Poverty and destitution must not be my fate\"—\nyet a household of six thrives daily in the spring wind.\n\nThe Master ascended the hall and said:\nYesterday I lost the advantage—\nBodhidharma lacked a front tooth.\nToday I gained the advantage—\nZhaozhou hung a gourd on the wall.\nHmph! Hmph!\n\nThe Master ascended the hall and said: *Ruo.* Then descended his seat.\n\nThe Master ascended the hall and said:\nRain like woven silk—\nfrom where does the silk arise?\nThe Yangtze’s waters surge toward the vast sea—\nwhat then?\nAfter a long pause, he said:\nTell me—how many feet high are your brows,\nhow many yards wide your eyes?\n\nThe Master ascended the hall and said:\nWhat place lacks refinement?\nThen descended his seat.\n\nAt the Crane Assembly of Pingjiang, upon the offering of incense and the exchange of questions,\nthe Master said:\nEnough of questions—for questions are endless,\nand answers without end.\nWhat use is this back-and-forth?\nEven with eloquence like a cascading river,\nhow could it capture the subtlest glimmer,\nor make fleeting words resemble the essential mystery?\nDo you understand?\nBefore the division of primordial chaos,\nwhat difference did the qi’s appearance hold?\nBefore your parents were born,\nafter a lifetime of seeking—\nfrom the late Zhou onward,\nacross the three teachings:\nConfucius had his three chariots and four steeds,\nLaozi his three caverns and four auxiliaries.\nThe teaching of Confucius?\nNothing but the single word *sincerity*.\nThe teaching of Śākyamuni?\nNothing but the single word *stillness*.\nLaozi’s teaching?\nNothing but *clarity and quiescence*.\nAs it is said:\n*If one can abide in constant clarity and quiescence,\nheaven and earth all return to him.*\nIn Confucius’ case, do we not see:\n*I have gone whole days without eating, whole nights without sleep,\nspent days in stupidity,\nfor three months without straying from humaneness—*\nnurturing my vast qi,\nmindful of this, ever present—\nthus he often found himself empty.\nHow true!\nFor the scholar of the Dao,\nhow to place the ruler above Yao and Shun,\nand restore purity to customs?\nIn Śākyamuni’s case, do we not see:\n*Throughout the twelve hours of day and night,\nthe constant light appears before you,\nlike a wall standing ten thousand fathoms high,\nlike a hen brooding her eggs,\nkeeping warmth unbroken,\ncontinuous and unbroken,\nwithout interruption—*\nthen, standing at the cliff’s edge, stretching out your hand,\nyou would dare to take it on,\nreviving after annihilation,\ndeceiving the sovereign is impossible.\nHow true!\n\nFor the scholar of Chan:\nHow is it that Linji enters the gate with a shout?\nTruth does not lie in loud voices.\nDeshan enters the gate with a staff,\nstriking the grass only to startle the snake.\n\nIn the case of the Old Master (Laozi), do we not see:\n*Penetrating the mysteries of yin and yang,\nprofoundly grasping the workings of creation,\npursuing the two qi along the Yellow Path,\nuniting the three natures in the Primordial Palace,\ngathering the Five Phases,\nharmonizing the Four Images,\ndragon’s roar and tiger’s howl—\nhusband sings, wife follows,\njade crucible simmers,\ngolden furnace blazes.\nWhen the seasonal cycle is complete,\nthe embryo transforms, the spirit transcends.\nAchievement fulfilled, fame attained—\na body beyond the body.*\n\nHow true!\n\nFor the scholar of immortality:\nHow to lead the White Tiger home to nurture,\nand give birth to a luminous pearl like the full moon?\nAfter all, are the Three Teachings the same or different?\nWho knows what era this tale speaks of?\nEven now, the laughter never ceases.\n\nThe master continued:\n*Days and months shuttle like a loom,\nlight and shadow fly like arrows.\nWillow threads draw spring away,\nlotus coins buy summer’s breeze.*\nAt court, the kitchen opens for bamboo shoots;\nin Śākya’s lineage, waxen figures are shaped.\nOn the Ten Isles and Three Mountains, all are clouds and moon-tube builders;\nacross the Four Seas and Five Lakes, all are rain-hatted, mist-robed wanderers.\nAmid endless dust, how many scattered sages?\nBeyond the world, transcendent immortals dwell with mortals and saints.\nHidden or manifest, unfathomable—\ntheir comings and goings unrecorded.\n\nClosing the seat:\n*In the fourteenth year of Jiading of the August Song,\nwhen orchids marked the month and heaven’s harmony prevailed,\nthe lakes and mountains repaid their debt to Lin’an,\nwhile wind and moon renewed their bond with Gusu’s green.\nOn the fourteenth day of the month in Gusu,\nthe fourfold assembly gathered for the Pure Yang Festival.\nOn this day the True Man of Pure Yang was born—\nlong ago, the \"Record of Immortal Journeys at Piao Beach\" told of it.*\n\nI have heard that in the Tang, Lü Chunyang,\nwhose master was Zhongli, styled Yunfang,\npersonally transmitted the secret of the Golden Elixir and Returned Cinnabar.\nWhen he attained the Dao, he wandered Jing and Xiang.\nDo people still recognize Pure Yang?\n*Crane’s neck, tortoise’s cheeks, body ragged and grimy.\nSometimes polishing mirrors in the marketplace,\nsometimes selling ink on the street,\nsometimes calling himself Tian, sometimes Hui,\nfrom Jiangkou to Jingkou, he came and went.\nOnce he carried two jars past Mount Lu,\nthen played twin flutes on Tiantai.\nWearing a green hat and red robe, he drank to ruin,\nsleeves hiding a green snake, awe-inspiring.\nIn Hongdu, he delivered Shi of West Mountain;\nin Shuchuan, he delivered Shen of East Forest.\nMorning in the Hundred Yue, evening in the Three Heavens—\nform and spirit gathered and dispersed, now present, now absent.\nIn a teahouse, he transmitted to Guo of Shangzao;\nin wine, he transformed He Xiangu.\nSometimes clad in white silk, sometimes in paper robes,\na sword slashing the sky, tumbling again and again.\nLaughing loudly, he returned to Mount Touzi,\na single phrase exposing the old man of Huanglong.\nIn Taiping Temple, he once left a poem—\nthree visits to Yueyang, who knows?\nAt dusk, he brushed his sleeves and left Wuyi;\nat midnight, he played with the moon on Junshan.\nDrunk, he sang wildly, dancing as he sang—\na game of evening chess, how many ages now?\nOn Yellow Crane Tower, in clear wind and bright moon;\non Peng River’s shore, among white duckweed and red reeds.\nThat year, after drinking a single dose,\nwho would believe a child was nurtured in nothingness?\nThe Eighteen Methods of the Perfect Art remain,\nyet he would not lightly speak them to others.\nThrice he sighed at failing the examinations,\ndeclaring his father was Lü the Remonstrator.\nIn his bag, auspicious herbs—no silver for medicine.\nBeyond the heavens, he wandered, riding the sword’s qi.\nThe master’s sword technique was untransmitted,\na thousand changes, ten thousand transformations, ever sudden.\nHeaven sent him to save living beings,\nfor in the fourth month, Pure Yang’s hexagram belongs to Qian.\nTaking the Kan trigram’s line to fill Li’s belly,\nit becomes pure Qian, yang qi fulfilled.\nThus he could ride qi and transform into a flying dragon,\nwherever he went, delivering people, leaving wondrous traces.*\n\nThis assembly in Pingjiang differs from others—\nthis year, especially, is unlike the past.\nIn former years, when the gathering was held,\nclouds parted and cranes soared in the sky.\nNow, a rustic ascends this seat—\nI must begin by breaking it open from the start.\nYou must grasp the heart of Pure Yang\nbefore you can learn the Dao of Pure Yang.\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken—how to learn it?\nScooping earth for incense is not yet the truth.\nOnly a true knower like Zhang Tianjue understands.\n\n**Minor Address at the Eastern Tower**\nRecorded by the disciple Zijuzi Zhao Jiang\n\nThe Supreme Dao resides in the heart—\nthe heart itself is the Dao.\nWithin and beyond the six senses,\nthe same wind and light prevail.\nIf inner things shift,\naging and death will come.\nSilent circulation of primordial harmony—\nthis is how to attain longevity.\n\nThus the body takes the heart as its lord;\nthe heart is the abode of spirit.\nWhen the heart is at peace, the spirit is numinous;\nwhen the heart is wild, the spirit is mad.\nEmpty the heart, and true qi congeals;\ncalm the heart, and yang harmony gathers.\nBlood and qi unobstructed, naturally flowing;\nwill and intent at ease, the myriad disturbances cease.\n\nWhen the heart grieves, yin qi congeals;\nwhen the heart rejoices, yang qi scatters.\nThoughts arise, and the spirit flees;\nthoughts cease, and the spirit rests.\n\nIn this human body,\nthe heart’s spirit\nemerges through the eyes to see—\nseeing long, the heart’s spirit departs,\nnot lost to greed but to exhaustion.\nThe kidneys’ essence emerges through the ears to hear—\nhearing long, the kidneys’ essence withers,\nnot ruined by lust but by depletion.\nThe liver’s hun emerges through the nose to smell—\nsmelling long, the liver’s hun scatters,\nnot harmed by anger but by dissipation.\nThe gallbladder’s po emerges through the mouth to speak—\nspeaking long, the gallbladder’s po dies,\nnot destroyed by impatience but by exhaustion.\n\nThe essentials of the Supreme Dao:\nUtmost stillness to congeal the spirit,\nprofound reflection to penetrate perception,\nfasting and abstinence to respond to the true,\ncompassion and kindness to complete merit,\nhumility and gentleness to preserve sincerity.\n\nLet the heart be free of杂念,\nthe intent not stray outward.\nLet the heart constantly return to unity,\nthe intent naturally thus.\nWith the heart serene,\nthe four great elements are at ease.\n\nIf the heart is not in the ears, what makes sound?\nIf the heart is not in the eyes, what makes color?\nIf the heart is not in the nose, what makes fragrance?\nIf the heart is not in the mouth, what makes speech?\n\nQi gathers, and one is full;\nspirit harmonizes, and one is warm.\nThus the heart of the Dao is the master of qi,\nqi is the root of form,\nform is the dwelling of qi,\nand spirit is the tool of form.\n\nSpirit is nature,\nqi is life.\nWhen the heart is still, qi is upright;\nupright, it is whole;\nqi whole, spirit harmonizes;\nharmonized, it congeals.\nSpirit congealed, the ten thousand treasures coalesce!\n\nShi Jianwu says: When qi abides, spirit abides;\nwhen spirit abides, form abides.\nOne must forget the passions to preserve one’s nature.\nNature preserved, form is naturally whole;\nqi is also whole,\nand the Dao is necessarily whole.\nThe Dao whole, spirit flourishes,\nqi becomes numinous,\nform may transcend,\nnature may be fully realized.\nCirculating without cease,\nit unites with the Dao as one.\n\nAbove from the Celestial Valley,\nbelow to the Yin Stem,\nthe two luminants meet,\nforged into a single mass.\nThus, over time,\nwithout the slightest interruption,\ntransformation lies within me,\nand I merge with the Dao in truth.\n\nSome ask: When the heart moves, spirit wearies;\nwhen the heart is still, spirit grows dull.\nNeither movement nor stillness suffices—\nwhat then is to be done?\nLike Xi Shi departing the golden palace,\nfair as Yang Guifei descending the jade tower,\nday after day, drunk with you amidst the blossoms—\nwhat place is not filled with grace?\n\nMoreover, the true master taught a gatha to the disciple:\nIn a three-household hamlet, old Auntie Huang,\nturning over at midnight, lost her pillow,\nand struck her husband’s nose—\nthe next morning, up she rose to search for her hairpin.\n\nHmph!\nThe spring man drinks spring wine,\nthe spring rod strikes the spring ox.\n\nThe disciple asked: \"Is this not the principle of returning to the root and restoring the mandate?\"\n\nThe master replied: \"The mouth your parents gave you will never speak for your child.\"\n\nThe disciple asked again: \"What then is this principle?\"\n\nThe master said: \"Upon the iron steamed bun, apricot blossoms bloom red.\"\n\nThe disciple asked: \"Might there yet be some resonance with this?\"\n\nThe master said: \"Yesterday at the street’s end, two firewood sellers had their front teeth broken by a man. Why do you cry injustice for them?\"\n\nThe disciple exclaimed: \"Ah! Just so!\"\n\nThe master said: \"Try to speak it yourself.\"\n\nThe disciple then recited:\n*\"Upon the iron steamed bun, apricot blossoms bloom red,\nFour-sided, clear through, everywhere it flows.\nTread upon the scale’s weight—hard as iron,\nYet Shinra lies but east of the sea gate.\"*\n\n**Winter Solstice Address**\n\nWithin the body, a treasure hides,\nconcealed in the cinnabar

Daoist was on Mount Luofu.\nBefore his eyes, all things flowed away like water—\nhow could heaven and earth compare to a floating bubble?\nI shall shed this form and return to the Jade Palace,\nthus I impart the fire-phase secret of the golden elixir,\nto Haiqiong the White Jade Toad of Qiongshan,\nthat he may deeply know the bones of creation.\n\nDharma Master Daoguang, Xue Zixian,\ntransmitted to me *Returning to the Root and Restoring Life*,\npointing to the two words \"lead\" and \"mercury\"—\nthe true mystery within the mystery.\nThrough ten months of toil,\ngradually gathering, gradually congealing,\nnow my entire body is white blood,\nand I feel the four seasons free of cold and heat.\nLater, I went again to study with others,\nexamining countless wild fox spirits—\neach unaware of the one true place,\nall mere side doors, not the real.\nFearing you waste this youth,\nI recount it all from the beginning.\n\nWithout the secret of the golden fluid returning elixir,\ndo not waste your spirit in vain.\nLike the deluded who practice bedroom arts,\ntheir hearts ever clinging to the chamber,\ncalling it \"yin elixir\" or \"the art of the jade woman,\"\npressing the perineum, inhaling and swallowing,\nseizing others’ essence and blood to supplement their own,\nclinging to the three peaks with perverse views.\nThey name the birth canal the \"place of life’s origin,\"\npracticing nine shallow and one deep thrusts in repetition.\nXuanyuan, Pengzu, Lao Rongcheng,\nHuanggu, Shouguang, Zhao Feiyan—\nthey have their own path to the heavens,\nwandering through taverns and brothels, testing their arts.\nDo not say you meet immortals among the flowers,\nonly to trade a golden hairpin for a tile.\nThe tree’s roots are already rotten, its leaves but vainly green,\nthe sea of qi churns—death comes swift as an arrow.\n\nOther side doors may yet weave a net of bliss:\nsome practice qi absorption as the Central Yellow,\nsome guard the crown as the Primordial Chaos,\nsome circulate qi as the Precelestial,\nsome swallow saliva as the Numinous Spring.\nOr they fixate on a point near the spleen,\ninsisting it is the root of breath—\n\nSome take mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female,\ndrawing in clarity and expelling turbidity to \"return and restore.\"\nSome silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor on High,\neyes upturned to guard the Mud Pill.\nWith these, they visualize qi’s ascent and descent,\ncalling it the \"Spine-Enclosing Pass.\"\nWith those, they hold breath and swallow saliva,\nnaming it the \"Elixir of Jade Liquid and Golden Fluid.\"\nWith others, they concentrate spirit below the navel,\nor fix thoughts between the brows.\nSome direct the mind to contemplate the spine,\nothers press the tongue to the roof of the mouth,\nhunch shoulders, retract necks, arch backs—\nall hailed as \"direct entry to the Jade Capital Mountain.\"\nThe mouth becomes the Flowery Pond, the tongue a dragon,\ndubbed \"divine water flowing murmurously.\"\n\nThese are all side doors of blissful practice,\nhow can they hope to become heavenly immortals?\nNine parts inhaled, one part swallowed,\ngathering qi to the navel, departing from fetal breathing.\nHands clutching prayer beads to count breaths,\nwater clocks and earthen gnomons to measure time.\nSome follow the *Lingbao Perfect Methods*,\ntucking tails to listen, swallowing saliva.\nSome study the *Xishan Gathering of Perfected Records*,\nfacing walls in wordless silence all day.\n\nThough men of this age learn to \"sit in meditation,\"\nwhen has the moon ever illumined the cold pond’s jade?\nThough they claim to \"embrace the Origin,\"\nwhen have they ever been like jade hidden in stone?\nSome say the Great Dao is fundamentally non-action,\nsitting dry as ash, hearts hollow, solitary in silence.\nSome claim to have already grasped the \"already-accomplished,\"\nyet ask them—where is this illusory body obtained?\n\nStill others toil in form to gather sun and moon,\ncalling it \"heavenly hun and earthly po.\"\nOthers ingest the Seven Luminaries at midnight,\nclaiming it the \"true bloodline of creation.\"\nSome \"fly golden essence from behind the elbow,\"\nqi steaming, water dripping.\nSome \"abandon true qi to the Great One,\"\nhearts darkly still, kidneys profoundly silent.\nSome circulate a flowing pearl in cycles,\nothers in stillness visualize a vermilion orange.\n\nAll such are \"life-nourishing methods,\"\nyet none can transform insubstantial into spirit.\nThe Dao’s essentials nurture the child within the void,\nthere lies the true and singular key.\nAll are but scattered fragments of the wondrous celestial mechanism,\nhidden in alchemical texts, never revealed.\nPity the deluded fools who cling to their errors,\npointing to one another in mutual confusion.\nThese mad, possessed lot—\nseated, they twitch and tremble for hours,\nstretching, bending, arching in countless postures,\nweeping, laughing, wailing like children at play.\n\nFor the square inch of the heart has no master,\nqi scatters, spirit flies wild.\nA throng of deluded men sing one another’s praises,\nusing this to deceive the vulgar and lure the foolish.\nThey know not how to unite with the Dao’s truth,\nonly how to join with demons in vain folly.\nThe moment the heart stirs, qi follows—\nleaping, trembling, they call it \"divine mechanism.\"\nSome say, \"This is yang qi arriving,\"\nothers, \"The dragon and tiger in battle.\"\nSome claim, \"The river chariot plies ten thousand markets,\"\nothers, \"Water and fire race in pursuit.\"\nSee how they agitate the five viscera’s qi,\nuntil one day spirit and essence leak away, exhausted.\n\nOf old, the Sage Ancestors left elixir formulas—\n\"from nothing, something\" as the foundation of the cinnabar.\nWhen did they ever display such demonic antics?\nAll are but lesser men, mere *icchantikas*.\nI have heard that the sages of former ages,\nwithin non-action accomplished all action,\nfrom formlessness giving birth to true form,\nwithout relying on visualization or forced practice.\n\nYet some brothers claim wonders stranger still:\n\"Heart and kidney are not Kan and Li,\nliver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, intestines, gall—\nmere empty houses, old fences.\"\nSaliva, mucus, essence, fluids, qi, blood—\nonly aids to be used as stepping stones.\nSpirit, soul, ethereal and corporeal souls, intent, qi—\nseeming so, yet not so in truth.\n\nWhy peer inward or scrutinize form,\nlisten for numinous echoes or gaze at the abyss?\nSwallowing mist, drinking dew, ingesting primordial qi—\neffort wasted, hearts wearied, no effect.\nStill they prattle of \"clarity and emptiness, tending the furnace fire,\"\ndemanding written pledges, extorting gold and treasure.\nDaring to compare a frog’s well to the vast ocean,\nclaiming, \"The Primordial Heavenly Worthy is none other than I!\"\nVainly assuming titles, feigning divine powers,\ncommanding ghosts and gods, expounding cause and effect.\nToday and tomorrow, they file petitions,\ninner elixir, outer elixir—nothing is beyond them.\nDeceiving the worthy, deluding the sagely, dimming the Three Luminaries,\nthey presume to foresee fortune and misfortune, trembling in awe.\nGathering disciples, they roam towns and villages,\ndrunk on wine, gorged on meat, forming packs like wildfire.\n\nThe Great Dao has always been free of names and forms,\ntrue immortals are never adorned with flowers and grasses.\nThey preach vows and toil—\nbetter you should toil yourself!\nOne man’s delusion might yet be endured,\nbut delusion passed on breeds delusion into old age.\nThese blind leading the blind,\nall plunge into the path of confusion, suffering woe.\nSuddenly, when fortune is exhausted and karmic retribution arrives,\nthey offend heaven—no prayer can save them.\n\nAlas! The world delights in learning immortality,\nbut how many pursue truth as their true study?\nRemember well the wise words of the ancients:\nonly with pure and mature effort does speech become immortal.\nUnclear speech marks no kin,\nunripe effort bears no fruit.\nI once practiced for a year—\nthe six pulses stilled, qi returned to the root.\nA child appeared within the cinnabar field,\nits form and features like my own.\nLooking back on those who study the Dao in this world,\nthree years, nine years—all in vain delay.\nStill they wander as clouds and waters across the four seas,\ncold-eyed, I see none worth transmitting to.\nIncense burned, they inquire of the Dao—yet bow to inferiors,\ndistinguishing false from true, knowing fools from the wise.\n\nReturning, I composed this *Song of Emerald Void*,\nradiant as the sun shining in the blue sky.\nSweeping away the petty arts of lesser learning,\ndistinguishing the firing times and refining the medicines.\nI take but one taste—the gold within water,\ngathering it into the void, the cave of creation.\nUrging the hundred pulses to return to their source,\npulses stilled, qi halted—the elixir begins to congeal.\n\nAt first, a withered tree clings to the cold cliff,\ntwo beasts meet like lightning.\nAt the central, true position, the Mysterious Pearl is born,\nwaves calm, wind still, clouds and rain cease.\nIn a moment, the elixir’s head appears—\nsoft as a silk floss, hard as iron.\nThis is the blood of the Vermilion Phoenix of the South,\nto be gathered, one must know the season.\n\nOnce this single attainment is complete,\nlife returns to the root, the true aperture.\nWithin, there is a true paradise,\nits scenery luminous, the moon bright.\nThe dragon’s chant, the tiger’s roar—lead and mercury unite,\nrevealing the Yellow Sprout and White Snow.\nWhenever heaven and earth conjoin,\nseize the mechanism of yin and yang’s creation.\n\nAt the hours of *mao* and *you*, *jia* and *geng*, one must bathe;\nAt crescent, full, dark, and new moons, guard against peril.\nWeigh each day and hour precisely,\nWithdraw and replenish in tranquil harmony.\n\nWithin the twelve hours, only one moment suffices—\nNine returns, seven reversions, these small matters.\nNurture with care, ever sealing tightly;\nThe *xun*-wind must ceaselessly blow into *kan*.\nWhether walking, sitting, sleeping, or eating, remain thus,\nEver fearful the fire may cool, the elixir’s power delayed.\n\nA year’s celestial cycle excludes *mao* and *you*;\nNine revolutions’ work is daily ninefold.\nWhen the tenth month arrives, jade frost descends,\nThe sacred embryo rounds, wind and thunder roar.\n\nA year’s gestation births one child,\nWho begets grandchildren, branching endlessly.\nIn its myriad transformations lies the subtlest art—\nHow could this be lightly taught to others?\n\nForget form, still the heart, sever self and other;\nIn life and death, motion and stillness, distinguish guest from host.\nAt dawn and dusk, medicines rise and sink;\nWater and fire, hexagrams and talismans must be scrutinized.\nTrue *qi* steams without cold or heat,\nPure yang overflows, beyond birth and death.\n\nThere is a path where mother and child part the embryo—\nIts wonder lies in *wei*, *ji*, *dou*, *niu*, and *nü*.\nShould you wish to prolong life and rescue the aged and infirm,\nSever lust and practice side doors no more.\n\nIf you would preserve form and dwell forever in the world,\nNone but stoking the fire to refine the divine elixir suffices.\nThe divine elixir’s work takes three hundred days—\nSeven dissolutions, seven moltings, and the Great Return is complete.\nGathered, it forms shape; scattered, it becomes *qi*—\nHeaven and earth, all are the same.\n\nBetter to seek a master’s peaceful method\nThan to lewdly plunder essence and blood.\nAs the ancients said: “Heaven and earth all return”—\nLearn the art of non-action and purity.\nBind the thousand-acre clouds of green mountains,\nScoop the single moon from the azure pool.\n\nThe Mysterious Pass’s aperture—none know it,\nYet this is the *daogui*, most wondrous and rare.\nOne night, I encountered Master Lü,\nWho held an elixir formula still more marvelous!\nTake the Great Void as crucible and furnace,\nSeize the crow and hare as medicinal materials.\nLet mountains, rivers, and the vast earth blaze with fierce fire—\nWithin, the ten thousand images birth wind and thunder.\n\nOnce chaos, now the myriad things,\nAll at once conjoin to form the sacred embryo.\nNo gold or wood to question or divide,\nNo dragon or tiger to separate north and south.\nNeither mother nor child, nor female nor male,\nNeither husband nor wife, nor black nor white—\nWho names this the Great Return Elixir?\nEven the Most High Lord Lao could not swallow it.\n\nLord Lao left it for the carefree wanderer,\nWho, having ingested it, soars as spirit to the Great Ultimate.\nThen take a cup of primordial wine,\nAnd with this *daogui* fortify your countenance.\nThough seas may turn to mulberry fields,\nIn my Dao, the pot’s year has not yet passed.\n\nIf only your heart were firm as iron,\nI would secretly transmit it word by word.\nThe subtlety lies in but half a phrase—\nThe immortals’ dharma is truly natural.\nHasten to begin, knit the embryonic immortal,\nAnd chanting brightly, return to Penglai’s heaven.\n\n**Haiqiong Jun’s “All Methods Return to One” Song**\n\nThe great medicine of the golden elixir is wondrous beyond measure,\nA single speck of elixir’s head glows red within and without.\nTrue mercury, true lead—once grasped,\nIn an instant the tiger is subdued, the dragon captured alive.\n\nThe Yellow Matchmaker weds them in Ding Gong’s abode,\nAt *xun*’s position, the nine revolutions’ work is blown to completion.\nAfter ten months, the embryo rounds beyond *li* and *kan*,\nPurple clouds ascend from the empty jade crucible.\n\nIn short hemp robes and headscarves, they throng the bustling market,\nSeeking herbs, burning thatch, tending the medicine chest.\nTheir own three yellows and four spirits—\nWho knows the intent behind installing the furnace and refining the crucible?\n\nPaper jackets and hempen garments hide in the mountains,\nEating pine, drinking water, enduring hunger and cold.\nSun’s essence, moon’s marrow—empty breaths,\nOnly in the end does one know the Way’s difficulty.\n\nIn the ghostly caverns beneath Black Mountain,\nBacks bent, heads drooping, mouths drooling,\nDreaming of dreamers within dreams—\nWhen will they await cinnabar’s death?\n\nThe foolish, ill-fated fail to sever lust,\nClosing the tailbone to plunder another’s yin.\nOriginal essence shakes without walls,\nMistaking yellow mud for gold.\n\nRong Cheng’s three peaks teach the art of riding women,\nPlundering essence to feed the eyes and breasts.\nThe Great Dao’s true fire has no yin or yang—\nToil in form and attachment is but vain suffering.\n\nKnocking teeth, swallowing saliva, gulping *qi* with sound,\nThe cart’s wheels turn in vain, the skull’s form moves.\nFalsely taking mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female,\nThey boast of golden crystals filling the elbow’s hollow.\n\nHolding breath at the nose’s tip, drawing empty cakes,\nHow many escape their shadows at noon?\nGuest winds and perverse *qi* rumble in the belly—\nHow could divine cinnabar long abide in the crucible?\n\nStudying Zen, perceiving nature, realizing suchness—\nDo not claim emptiness suffices without the heart.\nAwakened yet not practicing the wisdom of *qian*,\nA thousand cliffs and ten thousand ravines must still be traversed.\n\nHow many aged Confucians study the *Zhouyi*,\nYet know not the Great Ultimate returns to the Non-Ultimate?\nForgetting form, they would follow natural truth,\nBut fear spring’s departure leaves the grass powerless.\n\nThe Ming Sect’s sole task is demon-quelling—\nWhat of the seven-hour merits?\nUnknowing the bright intent of purity today,\nTheir faces sallow, their toil in vain.\n\nHu’s Yangshan, a single patriarch,\nHis nine returns’ adornments all empty words.\nWielding golden rings, driving three chariots—\nWho has ever flown to the Golden Heaven?\n\nMore are the four-fruit vegetarians,\nAt the Nine Bends’ riverbank casting iron talismans.\nThough they burn all their frankincense,\nHow can they become buddhas when essence and blood, original yang, are parched?\n\nThirty-six hundred guardians of side doors,\nOpening crowns, shrinking turtles, practicing breath-holding,\nVisualizing the cinnabar field, refining the five sprouts,\nExhaling the old, inhaling the new—wasted effort.\n\nWorshiping pagodas, burning incense, chanting sutras,\nEven bowing to the Dipper and gazing at stars,\nSwallowing talismans, drinking water, reciting spells—\nHow could laziness ever attain the Dao?\n\nVisualizing, massaging, the Eight Brocades,\nLaughing and exhaling the Six Words to constrain waking and sleeping,\nIf you wish to return essence to replenish the brain,\nNone but a cup of rich wine suffices.\n\nEyes straining to direct *qi* to the crown,\nPlayfully speaking of sun and moon illuminating Kunlun.\nWhen they glimpse a halo’s appearance,\nThey point to Heavenly Worthies and World-Honored Ones.\n\nEyes have no light—human delusion;\nEars have no sound—how could they hear?\nAbove lies the Great Abyss, below the Misty Pool,\nFalsely pointing to the Central Yellow, enduring hunger.\n\nVainly tracing celestial cycles, practicing hexagrams—\nWhen have they ever known the true dragon and tiger?\nThose who painfully know the true dragon and tiger\nHave grasped the upward path.\n\nSecretly clutching their bowls to drink urine,\nSpitting and swallowing saliva to form pearls,\nNose dripping two streams of snot—\nDare they call themselves Jade Stem Immortals?\n\nThose who exhaust themselves in \"preserving the Three and guarding the One,\"\nNine years refining elixirs in thought alone—\nForgetting their household treasure to seek without,\nA hundred years but a wandering ghost of yin and spirit.\n\nHeaven’s Gate wolfberries and yellow essence,\nBeans, apricots, ginger, pepper, ginseng, and licorice—\nHave they ever truly become earthbound immortals?\nSkin scorched, flesh rotted—pitiful creatures.\n\nFasting rites, purifications, proclamations, and Sanskrit chants,\nDividing talismans, breaking contracts, transmitting scriptures—\nUnknowing of the two true words of Heaven’s Heart,\nThey only master the Three Lights’ talisman-water,\nBrandishing thunder seals in their sleeves to frighten mountain spirits,\nWielding willow branches to mimic invisibility.\nThis heart is originally the treasury of communion with spirits,\nYet one errant thought spawns ten thousand illusions.\nThis body and all beyond it are hidden things,\nThis heart and all beyond it are sorcery.\n\nWithin the body lies the true heart, within the heart lies the body,\nNeither emerging from within nor without.\nAs for this Golden Liquor and Great Return Elixir,\nFrom the Original Valley to the Muddy Pellet,\nThe sevenfold refinement and replenishment are no great matter—\nPlants and trees, devoid of intent, mirror heaven and earth’s leisure.\n\nTrue roots, true stems bear true nectar,\nTrue crucibles, true altars, true alchemical furnaces.\nFrom the yang day they begin, on the yin day they accumulate,\nClearly distinguishing yang fire and yin talismans.\nHalf an acre of cinnabar field sown with golden millet,\nA single fragrant lingzhi blossom, rich and lush.\n\nThe iron ox roars into the cotton chamber,\nThe wooden horse gallops, leaping into the golden house.\nQian and Kun’s two eights congeal cinnabar,\nThe crucible brimming with melting white snowflakes.\nSeizing the tortoise and serpent in both hands,\nThe jade hare on the mountain peak transforms into a golden crow.\n\nThe oral formula for the Returned Elixir is known to few,\nMercury dragon and lead tiger depend on the fire’s timing.\nWithin three thousand moments, the infant takes form,\nTempered and nurtured without flaw.\nThe body becomes pure as a single piece of jade,\nThe cold toad’s light illumines the jade flask’s ice.\n\nAt midnight, thunder roars at the fontanel,\nA gust of pure wind in the marketplace startles gods and ghosts.\nIf celestial beings ask for the true esoteric formula,\nWho would dare leak Heaven’s secrets?\nOnly a hero of great resolve,\nWith a heart utterly empty,\nAt the first stirring of yang, the Great Elixir is complete—\nIn an instant, the adept becomes one with the numinous workings of creation.\nYet I fear my name may be recorded in the Southern Palace’s register,\nDrunk, riding a white crane to ascend to the Supreme Clarity.\n\n**Admonition on the Dao (also called \"Inscription for Broad Daylight\")**\n\nAlas!\nThe human body is like a rootless tree,\nRelying solely on breath as its trunk and branches.\nA hundred years of time\nAre like a dream.\nThe outgoing breath does not guarantee the incoming,\nThis morning does not guarantee the next.\nWasting the years,\nSuddenly old and dead,\nThe hundred bones dissolve,\nThe four elements disperse.\nThe spirit, confused and lost,\nScatters into the various destinies—\nWho knows what form the next life will take?\nThe wheel of birth and death turns endlessly,\nDeluded, failing to awaken,\nLazy, failing to strive.\nNow that you have arrived at this treasure mountain,\nDo not leave empty-handed.\nTo grow old and die as before,\nHaving come to the world in vain—\nEach must exert utmost effort,\nDevote yourself to the work as if your life depends on it.\nAs the ancients said:\n\"A year or two of toil,\nA thousand or ten thousand kalpas of bliss.\"\nFrom now on, gather your resolve,\nSingle-minded, without distraction.\nEyes, do not gaze outward;\nEars, do not listen outward.\nModerate your diet,\nReduce your sleep,\nCease idle chatter,\nStill your thoughts.\nCover your head with straw,\nSeek no comfort;\nCook rice to stave off hunger,\nDisregard minor hardships.\nLike the cicada drinking dew,\nYour body will become light and pure;\nLike the tortoise absorbing sunlight,\nYour lifespan will extend.\nIf you can dine on pine and cypress,\nWear a bamboo hat and straw cloak,\nSleep beneath clouds in the cliffs,\nDrink from streams before caves—\nYou are a true cultivator.\nIf you lack such strength,\nAt least gradually emulate the ancient worthies.\nTo practice otherwise\nIs to lack this fortune.\n\nStrive morning and night,\nRefining and smelting hour by hour.\nLike a dragon nurturing its pearl,\nLike a hen brooding her eggs,\nThe fire’s continuity forges a single whole.\nWhen mother and child meet at last,\nIs it not joyous?\n\n**Verses on Transmitting the Dharma and Illuminating the Mind by Peng Helin**\n\nThe myriad dharmas arise from the heart,\nEach thought is itself dharma.\nSpeech and silence, movement and stillness—\nAll are governed by dharma.\nWithout doubt, this is the true heart;\nGuarding the One is the true dharma.\nGuard the One without doubt,\nAnd every dharma becomes a dharma of the heart.\n\nDharma is the servant of the heart,\nThe heart is the master of dharma.\nWithout doubt, the heart is upright;\nAn upright heart makes dharma efficacious.\nGuard the One, and the heart is focused;\nA focused heart makes dharma manifest.\nIt is not that dharma is inherently efficacious—\nIt is your heart that makes it so.\n\n**Memorial to the Yellow Register Office**\n\nYour subordinate, the youthful servant Bai [Name], who attained the Dao underground and upholds the dharma, respectfully memorializes:\n\nFrom my earliest existence, by the grace of the August Emperor and the King,\nThe sacred *qi* dwelled within me,\nAnd my spiritual root remained unobscured.\nKnowing of this matter in past lives,\nI cultivated in this life and now encounter it again.\nI have been entrusted with thunder talismans\nAnd have roughly grasped the teachings.\nYet I, your subordinate, know this:\nThe Most High Dao, the Compassionate Father and Sacred Mother,\nAnd the Lords of the Ten Directions,\nHave always shown mercy and forgiveness.\nThus, I have grown lazy and negligent,\nFailing to maintain incense and offerings all year.\nIn the immortal registers,\nIt is as if I did not exist.\nYet I dare to presumptuously submit this memorial,\nFor I have my reasons.\n\nThis body of mine—\nSkin, hair, bones, blood,\nTears, saliva, phlegm—\nCannot become true.\nBut I possess a single numinous heaven,\nThe original nature,\nThe spirit of the primordial mandate.\nBoundless and immeasurable,\nIt can ascend to the imperial and brahmic realms,\nStanding in attendance before the Jade Dawn.\nThough I am lazy and negligent,\nThe Imperial True One knows me.\nEven ghosts and spirits can do nothing about it!\n\nIn years past, I was awakened to this:\nAll those who have attained the Dao and uphold the dharma in the mortal world,\nWith their ranks and titles,\nAre merely false claims.\nIf they serve in the celestial bureaus,\nTheir positions are assigned differently.\n\nNow with this humble clod of earth and dust, Peng Xiang, I have expounded and established the Yellow Register for my father, and thus am commanded to submit this memorial. Since I cannot refuse, I humbly request that for a time, I be granted the title of *Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity Palace Thunder Command*, to command the Five Thunder Generals and lead the affairs of the Thunder Bureau’s spirits and deities. Acting as the *Attendant Envoy of Supreme Clarity and the Yellow Register*, I shall resign this post once the ritual feast concludes. Should I be called to dispatch wind and thunder or distinguish between humans and ghosts, I ask only to borrow the thunderous title from above to address myself. When the day comes for my worldly obligations to be fulfilled and I present myself at court, I shall await further decree from the celestial offices. A myriad deaths would not suffice to atone for my presumption in daring to offend Your Celestial Majesty.\n\n**Memorial of Gratitude and Petition**\n*Submitted by the unworthy official [Name]*\n\nI respectfully submit this memorial on the twenty-third day of this month, presenting myself at the celestial gate to express gratitude and lay bare my heart.\n\nI reflect that nature is bestowed by Heaven, and whether one is wise or foolish, good or evil, is likewise ordained by Heaven. When humans and the Dao move in harmony, every action and stillness aligns with the Dao. Why then do dark realms establish courts of the netherworld, while the celestial powers institute bureaus of reward and punishment? The body and form arise from the cycles of qi, and fate is bound to the stars. Truly, life and death do not arise of themselves but seem to emerge from the interplay of yin and yang. The celestial mechanism never ceases, and the sentiments of beings readily shift—winter arrives, and ice naturally forms; spring comes, and grass turns green. All is shaped by qi, and thus the nature is established as its master. A thousand lamps illuminate a room with a single light, just as the vast sea contains countless waves. The distinction between the sentient and the insentient, and the difference between life’s allotment and its fulfillment, lie herein. Yet movement and stillness are not their original state; thoughts and desires manifest only after form takes shape. Once form is complete, the Dao resides within it. Those who attain it merge with the true, while those who lose it sink into confusion. Thus, the path of cultivating immortality and studying the Dao begins with establishing the gate of rectifying the mind and sincerity of intent. The Great Dao alone transcends life and death, and utmost sincerity can reverse the workings of creation. To preserve sincerity is to unite with the Dao, and all who attain the Dao possess sincerity. This is the path by which all beings enter, the realm where all sages have ascended.\n\nI, a being of impure flesh and defiled bones, a walking corpse of mere form, am endowed with vital qi and a nature that remains undimmed. My six senses are complete, and the three times are perfectly rounded. I can distinguish between beans and wheat, yet I dissolve distinctions of right and wrong, rising above the taint of honor and disgrace. In activity and stillness, stillness pervades all; in perceiving form and emptiness, emptiness encompasses all. I recognize that the six consciousnesses have no root, and the seven emotions are like dreams. I see how flesh and blood intoxicate the nature, and how form and substance stifle the spirit. Long have I hastened toward the mysterious pass, yet still I linger at the threshold of the Dao’s gate. Nature is trustworthiness, and the spirit communicates through it.\n\nI reverently consider the *Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity True King*, the *Great Emperor of Longevity*, the *Jade Sovereign*, the *Golden Portal True August One*, the *Jade Clarity Supreme Emperor*—whose heart contains the Great Brahma, whose hands grasp the Primordial Chaos, whose vastness defies naming, whose majesty is beyond reach. In compassion for all beings, You govern the multitude of perfected ones, bestowing grace upon the ten directions and surveying the myriad realms. I, a mere ant in form, dare to raise the voice of an earthworm, long bearing the weight of Your boundless favor, drenched in the nourishing rain of Your grace. Every prayer I have offered has been met with response. Fortunate to have heard the Dao a day sooner, I have cultivated the true amidst ten thousand kalpas. I now humbly recount the gradual progress of my practice and the beginnings of my realization.\n\nThough dull-witted, I secretly aspire to receive Your instruction, hoping that my lowly name might one day join the ranks of the ministers of the Empyrean. Presumptuously submitting this memorial, I dare to seek Your sagely attention. I confess my errors and beg for Your boundless mercy, that I may temporarily rouse the mind of revival and extinction to harmonize with the wondrous subtlety of emptiness. The methods of the Thunder Department I practice, the statutes of the Thunder Bureau I uphold—all serve to assist the upright, expel evil, aid the living, and deliver the dead. The officers and generals of the Three Bureaus are subject to my command, and the five divisions of wind and thunder answer to my summons. Should even the smallest merit or slightest good be recorded on the golden tablets, then this humble servant may one day reach the Jade Capital. Though the hemp grows straight when planted among reeds, and the fish thrives in water, without nurture it withers. Some say the crane is long and the heron short, yet there are snakes that shed their skins to become cicadas.\n\nI, in my foolishness, have dared to offend Your Celestial Majesty. With trepidation, I submit this memorial for Your consideration. I am filled with awe and reverence.\n\nLetter to Peng Helin\n\nOn the fourteenth day of the ninth month in the dingchou year, Yu Chan, about to journey to Quanshan, addressed his friend, the Perfected Officer Helin:\n\nThough we parted but recently, my heart is already heavy with longing. My sworn brother, you aspire to immortality—not as one of the common crowd. Of late, you have come to understand the principle that the myriad methods return to the One, and you are no longer deceived by the various schools. This is the very focus of the sages and worthies of ancient times, rarely seen in recent ages. The Dao is not far—how could you fail to attain immortality?\n\nZhang Xiyu once said that there is a proper method for each stage, a secret method for each stage, a wondrous method for each stage, yet all methods ever reside in the heart—there is no other method. Though his words may seem careless, they are indeed well-founded.\n\nWhen first we met, we already spoke of the great elixir of golden cinnabar as our shared aspiration; only the timely conditions had not yet aligned. Now the moment has come, and our great trust requires no prior agreement. Recall our earlier verses in exchange, with lines such as “tiger-skin bamboo hat, Mount Taihua crown”—today, as a Dao official of Mount Taihua and the Cinnabar Scenery Bureau, I realize that those poems of old were already foreshadowing our present rendezvous.\n\nIn all matters, take care; in sacred matters, take care; in every matter, take care. I have already spoken too much.\n\nAh! Ah!\n\nTo the Secretariat Clerk of the Ministry, I extend my regards with good fortune. Respected Alchemist of the Elixir Pearl, can you truly trust and undertake this matter? Regarding the lodging I previously advised for this winter through next spring, the Celestial Gallery of Painted Scenery would suffice. Or if you prefer to wait until spring’s gentle warmth for our pact, it will not be long before we meet again.\n\nThere is no need to laboriously consult charts and diagrams—simply attend to nurturing the heart! Otherwise, gather the methods you have acquired before and after, compile them into a volume, and store it high upon the shelf. Engage only with Ju and Hao as your companions, and all affairs will become effortless yet wondrously efficacious.\n\nNow, before the incense burner of the two messengers, employ this single talisman as you see fit—whether to consecrate, affix, ingest, or carry—using it according to your prayers, and nothing will fail to prosper. There is no need for excessive recitation.\n\nThis is nothing extraordinary—merely that the heart and spirit unite, and its use becomes potent! For consecrated water, a simple incantation suffices, as though a true dragon: a single drop becomes a torrential downpour. Why employ such complexity? The paper offerings unravel thread by thread—ponder this! Ponder this!\n\nAt the time, residing in the Purple Pivot Tower for writing.\n\nOn the fourteenth day of the ninth month, Yu Chan set out from Luojiang, following the tide southward, and by the eighteenth day arrived at Quanshan. Though weary from travel, fortune favored a slight ease of body and spirit, and thoughts of old friends from the Three Mountains arose—lingering a while longer, I shall yet become a guest by the Zhang shores.\n\nThe vow made last spring shall not falter!\n\nFor now, I savor the Dao in solitude, content with incense, candles, and the attendants of the officials—nothing more than a single talisman and a draught of water, sufficient to dispel illness and repel malevolent influences. This is the true purpose of acting on Heaven’s behalf to transform the world. I have entrusted the preparation of medicinal pearls and ritual implements to Attendant Longevity of the Ministry, along with Immortal Longevity. Daily, I envision your refined and carefree bearing, regretting only that I could not visit the new hermitage east of the city for a cup of tea. This wish must be fulfilled.\n\nThose who study the Dao, beyond examining their faults and reflecting on their errors, should accept even minor setbacks with equanimity. Where the Dao resides, can worldly matters truly bring us joy or sorrow?\n\nThe waters of Penglai have grown shallow once more!\nThe mulberry fields lie level—turning back to gaze upon the old path.\n\nWritten in autumn at the Immortal Shedding Hut, the ding-chou year.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the third month in the wu-yin year, residing at the Temple of Supreme Peace and Prosperity in Jiangzhou, I write to send word to my worthy brother, the True Man of Crane Grove. Recently, I sent three letters—have they reached you? Of late, I trust your mastery of the Dao and its methods has advanced, your spiritual power surpassing what came before.\n\nHave the two talisman officials, Ju and Hao, been diligent in their duties? I wonder if the health of your household’s Attendant Longevity of the Ministry remains robust, and whether the Recluse of Medicinal Pearls and your heir, Chengfeng, are both well and at peace?\n\nThis spring, I traveled over two thousand li by water and land in search of a secluded retreat on Mount Lu. Fortunately, my four limbs feel light and unburdened, and all matters proceed smoothly. Yet on flower-bright mornings and moonlit evenings, with wine in hand and incense curling from the brazier, I often think of my southern friends with longing. And for old companions, my heart aches even more!\n\nThose who dwell beyond the world—whether mortal or sage—do not let honor or disgrace weigh on their minds, nor praise or blame occupy their thoughts. Only the spirits of trees and the demons of stones might discern what manner of person one truly is.\n\n*The Song of the Great Dao* and *The Chart of the Immortal Lineage* must surely be in wide circulation by now—how delightful! How delightful!\n\nMy old friend, I pray you whip your steed onward—this letter shall not detain you further. Take care! Take care!\n\nRespectfully inscribed by this old man of Qiongshan, Bai, on the twentieth day of the tenth month.\n\nThis old man of Qiongshan, Bai, writes to Master Peng of the Crane Forest in Fuzhou. This spring, I arrived in Jiangzhou and proceeded to Xingguo Commandery, then passed through Yueyang, returned to Yuzhang, and stopped at Fuzhou before paying homage at Huagai Mountain. Descending to Linjiang Commandery, I took the route through Rao and Xin to prepare for my journey. On the first day of the eighth month, I presented myself at the imperial court, then traveled to Shaoxing, passed through Qingyuan Prefecture, and returned once more to Lin’an.\n\nOn the twentieth day of the tenth month, while wandering idly, I suddenly encountered Xiao Qian’an. From him, I learned that Liaoran has already passed away, Ruan has returned to Xiangshan, Zihu remains, and Dianxian is well. I have repeatedly received summons from Ningguo, but I no longer go to see them. Shi Kui now holds a key position in the Bureau of Military Affairs, and each has his own connections—one may call upon him if inclined. Yet my enthusiasm has waned, and all things now rest in tranquility. Each day, I do nothing but drink deeply, sing heartily, and bid farewell to the passing hours. I seek nothing more, nor do I ponder further.\n\nOnly for you, my Crane Forest—my beloved disciple, far away beyond two thousand *li*—I humbly pray that, even now, you attend upon the venerable Elder of the Ministry of Personnel, the immortal old master, and the young Daoist of the Pearl of Medicine, all of whom I trust are well. Qian’an could speak of one or two matters, which would bring me great comfort.\n\nHere, my wild and eccentric ways bring me joy, and others have grown accustomed to them. Only my uncle, the Recorder of the Realm, is greatly astonished by my unconventionality. The methods I now practice remain potent. Once, in a drunken stupor, I lost my footing and plunged into the waters of West Lake—my dharma-seal vanished entirely! Yet this too may provoke a hearty laugh.\n\nI had intended to journey to Tiantai, but before departing, I summoned Qian’an to instruct him. Gazing southward, my thoughts grow heavy with longing, and though I would write more, my brush falls silent.\n\nRespectfully bowing twice, I address this to my esteemed friend, the True Man of the Crane Forest. Since parting by the lakes and mountains of Yuan and Kai, time has slipped away. Suddenly, your letter arrived, bringing great comfort after our three autumns apart. I rejoice to learn that your campaigns have triumphed, and in your leisure, you cultivate and refine yourself. May the winds and thunder attend your command, and may your well-being flourish in every way. The Pearl of Medicine, attending to the scriptures, shares in this felicity.\n\nYou graciously sent me the *Classic of Purity* with your interlinear verses—each word aligns with the Dao, each phrase resonates with truth. Though you modestly asked for corrections, I find it already precise and flawless, with nothing to critique. Like a ceaseless spring, it flows day and night, reaching its perfect end!\n\nMay it spread to the four seas—shall we yet meet again? You are a master of the great Dao. I cherish and safeguard this gift; should further revelations come, pray share them without reserve! I implore you!\n\nI, a mere flickering shadow, parted with you at Yellow Pond as you journeyed south. Like wild geese, we soar side by side—you toward Cassia Mountain, I toward Lotus Marsh, where the wind stirs the pools and the moon graces the pavilion. Last night and this evening blur as if a dream. Yet who am I, that you have long honored me with the intimacy of a disciple, treating me with the reverence due a teacher? Far beyond my worth, I can never repay such boundless generosity. Each time I reflect, my ears burn with shame.\n\nIt has been ten years since the road to Divine Empyrean faded from view—cranes vanished, phoenixes dissolved into darkness, and autumn’s sorrow lingers. I long to summon the yellow swan, ride the purple mist, lead the vanguard of wind and thunder, and follow with the Azure Dragon’s millstone. Yet how can I? The dust-debts clinging to my flesh remain unpaid, the karmic vines rooted in my bones unsevered. For now, I can only grip the tiller against the wind, wading through the abyss in pursuit—different paths, yet converging in the same Dao.\n\nDregs and swill, ferment and sip—I only deepen my own filth. Yet casting nets into the rushing torrent, one may still catch fish. In this life, none have encountered fortune like yours. Now you dwell in the profound, ever more resembling the Dao!\n\nOnly through unwavering certainty is qi made complete; only through fearlessness is spirit preserved whole. Thus, with certainty, the true harbors spirit within; with fearlessness, sincerity knows no law beyond. From dawn’s darkness to dusk’s practice, you accumulate immortal merit, accepting worldly karma only to return it to the Jade Treasury. Ever advancing, ever ascending—dare I urge you onward.\n\nDo not say, *\"Today is today, and tomorrow remains\"*—or *\"This year is this year, and next year will come\"*—or *\"This life is this life, and future lives await\"*—or *\"This body is this body, and later bodies follow.\"* Little do you know: the lamp snuffs out upon the bed, shoes and slippers part ways—where then is next year? Where the morrow?\n\nA father does not trust his son; a hand does not trust its own embrace. Where then is the later body? Where the future life? You must strive with all your might. Do not see me as I am—should I drift and sink, whom could you rely upon?\n\nMy throat tightens as I write; this parting must be long, waters vast and clouds distant. The heavens darken in sorrow—take care, each of you.\n\nRespectfully entrusted to Peng Helin,\nSo-and-so bows in reply.\n\nTo the worthy disciple of Helin the Perfected,\nYour spring affairs flourish with grace, water warms and flowers bloom. Though your journey has been rough, you are broadly at ease—no need for concern.\n\nLast year, pressed by the eve of the New Year, I passed through Penholder Mountain; this New Year’s Day, I herewith submitted memorials to the various heavens, offering sacrifices to the gods. On that very day, I was humbly enrolled among the registrars under the Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder-Sound Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy, signing and sealing documents for the Thunder Bureau’s affairs concerning ghosts and spirits. I further received the Supreme Clarity Talisman for Dispatching Ghosts and Spirits, the seal script of which has been submitted above—truly a means to govern and pacify the numinous.\n\nThe elder has since passed through Kanglu. If nothing has been seen or heard, do not send word, lest it drift or sink. By late autumn or early winter, we shall surely meet again. *The Jade Scripture of Thunder* should be printed by now; distribute ten copies to transmit among the scholars of Jiangxi. My heart brims with reverence. In the meantime, conduct yourself with the Dao and devote yourself to the Dharma, as befits the former veneration of the Celestial Officials.\n\nOn the fifth day of the first month, Yang Bozi sent a messenger bearing a carved box and two old-style quatrains, their sentiment and phrasing most respectful. I have transcribed them here; the rest need not be mentioned.\n\nSo-and-so bows in reply.\n\nTo Helin, Thunder Bureau Magistrate: Your medicinal pearls attend the scriptures, your solitary jade gleams between the hours. The Dipper’s handle points thrice—you have long since settled deep in your native land. How long it has been since we parted!\n\nI still recall when an old acquaintance took up his post in Leizhou. At the initial handover, there appeared an enormous egg, most strange, larger than a peck measure. It remains there to this day, and thus the place is named Leizhou. Some say it was the afterbirth of Chen Luanfeng—how extraordinary! Yet what manner of being was Chen that he did not become the Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder General-in-Chief?\n\nNow we two are indeed no common men. My name is recorded in the register of Pengxi Terrace, my person ranks among the attendants of the Jade Palace. My destiny was long inscribed in the mysterious chart, my bones and features marked for this office. Though I may lack virtue, in death I shall return to my original cohort. Reflecting on past lives, I find no great transgressions. From now on, I shall live out this world’s allotted span, repaying karmic debts in due course. When the years and months are fulfilled, I shall hasten back to my former post—this is certain! It is also my private assurance.\n\nYour faith in me grows ever firmer, your affection ever deeper. Humbly sharing this office, we follow no different path. I only hope you will amass merit and conduct, ascending thereby to the ranks of the immortals. Do not regard me as diligent or indolent. From beginning to end, trust in me—may these words serve you well!\n\nThe hour of *mao* belongs to *Zhen*, and *Zhen* governs thunder; yet the Western Terrace pertains to Metal, and Metal resides in the West, where it restrains the eastern *Zhen*—such is the overcoming of Wood by Metal. Thus, whenever thunder arises, the Western Terrace must command its destiny. The authority behind its issuance lies with the officials of the Thunder Department, yet they know not of the Jade Pivot, nor of the Immortal Capital, nor even of the Western Terrace. Most are but functionaries of the Bureau of Envoys or lesser offices. When their time in this world ends, if they have no merit or conduct to their name, so be it; but if they possess merit, they may enter the ranks of the Thunder Officials—yet their baseness and defilement are too grave to recount, much like those of Fengdu who, upon death, become mere ghostly functionaries.\n\nYour appointment and investiture, however, have already placed you within the Immortal Capital and the Western Terrace! I know you possess the capacity for transcendence—why? Because those who may attain immortality share seven traits: first, their karmic debts to wives and children are light, and their worldly ties are sparse; second, their nature is serene and numinous, discerning matters before they arise; third, their eyes, hair, and bones resemble those of the forest immortals at dawn; fourth, their minds are fixed upon a single office, like an archer loosing an arrow; fifth, they cultivate and refine themselves day and night without fail; sixth, their every action aligns with the Dao, never straying far from truth; and seventh, their attainment is already complete, yet their years are not yet spent. Ascending from these, what heights could they not reach?\n\nSince my youth, I have been but a speck in the vast spring of humanity, yet I have acted accordingly. Perhaps we may meet again at the confluence of rivers to bid farewell on an appointed day—let this be our settled resolve. Yet your time in this world will not be long! In fond remembrance of the two immortals, I have spoken my heart and recounted these matters, unaware of how lengthy my words have grown. I trust your esteemed gathering is well and that your health remains robust.\n\nOn the fifth day of the eighth month, I respectfully reply.\n\nAs for Master *Haiqiong’s* collected works, I have long since received them in multiple transmissions. I recall that in the late spring of *dingshou* during my younger years, when my teacher journeyed south in his chariot, I was fortunate to pay my respects. Thereafter, like clouds and cranes, we came and went, and with each audience, I was granted a brief respite. Day after day, I attended his seat and heard what I had never heard before—nothing but the discernment of right and wrong, the elucidation of profound mysteries. Returning, I committed these teachings to writing, and they filled the pages abundantly. Though I am but a withered old man, unworthy of my teacher’s instruction, I dared not keep them hidden. Thus, I have compiled them into four volumes, including his *Shengtang Xiaocan* and hymns of praise, to be engraved for posterity. May they serve as a guide for the sea of learning, and perhaps open the eyes and ears of gods and men—this is my humble wish.\n\nWritten with reverence on the *jiazi* day of the late winter of *Xinhai* in the *Chunyou* era by Peng Xiang of Helin, foremost disciple of the White Patriarch.\n\nThe above words were composed by the Perfected Peng Helin, a disciple of the White Patriarch. The Perfected One hails from a great clan of the Three Mountains, akin to the lineage of Yang and Xu, the chroniclers of Mount Mao. This compilation was entrusted for transmission and reception. I once obtained a copy of the Perfected One’s words—a volume from the Tianqing edition of Fuzhou—appended with his postscript. Here, I have transcribed it anew to complete this work, which is preserved in the collection of the Great Constant Fast, the Dharma Master Jiang.\n\nHaving received the Great Rites of the *Jingxiao* from the Patriarch, I often employ the Generals Ju and Hao. This text fully records their names, and the work is wondrously esoteric—just as Master Peng said, it opens the eyes of gods and men. Scholars should ponder it deeply, for therein lies true attainment.\n\nRespectfully inscribed on the eighteenth day of the seventh month in the *renyin* year by Fang Congyi, Student of the Three Caverns’ Scriptures and Registers of the Supreme Clarity, Immortal Minister Assisting the Transformation of the Great Luo, and Libationer of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Gate. Thus concludes the fourth volume of *The Recorded Sayings of the White Perfected of Haiqiong*.",

      "translated_text": "The Master said: \"The nest knows the wind, the burrow knows the rain. Alas! What of man?\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"All the dharmas in the world, all the gates within the dharma—these are but formulas for compounding medicine, remedies for curing illness. Only when you know the decoction’s envoy does the medicine take effect.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What is the decoction’s envoy?\"\nThe Master replied: \"The heart is the envoy of the dharma.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"One day, the generals and officers of the Thunder Department reported: 'Wherever an incense burner is set, there is the Jade Clarity Palace of Divine Empyrean.' Yuanchang asked: 'The scriptures speak of thirty-six hundred divine maidens ever at my side, and the sigh within says thirty-six thousand spirits dwell in my body. These incantations are all the words of the Most High—are they real? Illusory? True? False?'\n\nThe Master answered: \"Within the human body dwell the Three Inner Treasures: essence, qi, and spirit. Spirit is the host; essence and qi are the guests. I am the host; the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens are the guests. The thirty-six hundred divine maidens and thirty-six thousand spirits are all transformations of essence and qi. Nowadays, men’s hearts are like restless monkeys and galloping horses, racing a thousand miles in a day—how much more when essence is depleted by lust and qi exhausted by anger? Moreover, the eyes are led astray by forms, the ears deceived by sounds. What benefit do they gain, while what they lose is beyond measure? They do not realize that the radiance of spirit scatters outward, qi and strength disperse in all directions. When essence and qi are no longer preserved, can the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens remain at their side? The ten thousand spirits are one spirit; the ten thousand qi are one qi. From the One arise the ten thousand; gathering the ten thousand returns to the One—all reside in one’s own spirit.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"A single human thought, when concentrated, becomes spirit; when scattered, becomes qi. When spirit gathers, it is called *hun*; when qi gathers, it is called *po* giving rise to life.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"When a person dies, it is called a ghost. Yang is *hun*; yin is *po*.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"*The Scripture of the Northern Dipper* was not composed by the Most High. It was recorded by Zhang Zhengyi of the Han dynasty, who transmitted the Most High’s intent to create it. Nowadays, people do not understand the scripture’s meaning and merely gaze at the stars and worship the Dipper. Within the human body, there is a single qi, rising in the east and setting in the west, ascending and descending—just like heaven and earth. The qi of heaven and earth consists of yin and yang; what humans receive is the same. As for the Northern Dipper in the sky, it revolves day and night, dividing yin and yang, determining the hours—thus heaven and earth endure through it. Why not reflect: who governs the single qi within the human body? Knowing who governs it is to know the Northern Dipper within oneself. *The Dipper Scripture* says: 'A household possessing *The Scripture of the Northern Dipper* ensures the prosperity of its livestock.' This refers to the Northern Dipper within the body, which governs its qi. Then the eyes do not crave sights, the ears do not seek sounds, the nose does not desire fragrances, the tongue does not long for tastes, the body does not seek touch, and the mind does not indulge in thought. Preserving this vital essence naturally leads to a peaceful dwelling and flourishing descendants.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"The Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Demons originally had only four generals: Cui, Lu, Deng, and Dou. Now four more have been added. The Plum Immortal’s Bureau for Summoning originally had only four generals: Pan, Geng, Lu, and Zha. Now four more have been added. These are all later additions, not part of the original method.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"In ancient ritual methods, some used the two generals Huang and Liu, others Gao and Ding, or Jiao and Zeng, or Sang and He, or Xu and Xie. Whatever was received from one’s master was effective without fail.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"*The Purple Text of the Heart of Heaven* states: 'The Three Origins penetrate emptiness; the Five Phases penetrate brilliance; the Eight Trigrams penetrate dawn; the Ten Directions penetrate truth.' Nowadays, people practice the *Eight Trigrams Penetrating Dawn* method but activate the spirit characters—this is ignorance of its origins, passing down confusion upon confusion.\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"In ancient times, there was no Fengdu method. At the end of the Tang dynasty, Master Dayuan Hao first transmitted this method to the world for summoning and interrogating ghosts and spirits. The original method contained only eight generals, three talismans, four incantations, and the seal of the Fengdu General Record Bureau. Later generations added excessively, becoming overly verbose—how can such things be considered authentic methods?\"\n\nThe True Master said: \"The method clearly states the Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Demons—why is it called the Heavenly Mechanism Bureau? Thus, the Southern Culmen has the Heavenly Pivot Bureau, just as in heaven there is the Heavenly Pivot Ministry on the left and the Heavenly Mechanism Ministry on the right. The Heavenly Mechanism is the inner bureau of the Northern Culmen, while the Expelling Demons is the outer bureau. Likewise, the Heavenly Pivot is the inner bureau of the Southern Culmen, and the Southern Culmen also has the Memorial Presenting Bureau as its outer office.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"A single human thought can move heaven and earth. Now, when submitting memorials and dispatching generals and officers, after burning them, they should naturally reach their destination—why then do the Six Heavens’ demonic forces intercept them?\"\n\nThe Master answered: \"A thought of utmost sincerity, in accord with the Dao, can summon true spirits without doubt. In ancient times, there were those with filial hearts, sincere hearts, righteous hearts, compassionate hearts, resolute hearts, and loyal hearts—all moved heaven and earth in moments of offering. This was due to the singleness of their hearts and the rectitude of their thoughts. Nowadays, when people burn memorials to report to the imperial throne, it is merely the ritual teaching that compels them. The resonance of their thoughts is like shooting an arrow at a target, while the resonance of memorials is like thrusting a spear at an object. Though the arrow flies far, it arrives swiftly; though the spear is near, it is hard to reach. Thus, memorials are tangible things, and demonic forces can intercept them. But if thoughts arise from the formless, how can demonic forces intercept them?\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"Human thoughts arise and vanish ceaselessly—why can this thought not summon?\"",

      "translated_text": "Yuanchang answered: \"Have you not seen how a cat hunts a mouse? Its eyes stare fixedly without blinking, its four paws crouch unmoving upon the earth, its heart harbors no stray thoughts, its mind entertains no idle fancies, its six senses align as one, and its head and tail form a single line—thus, every strike finds its mark.\n\nThe True Master said: \"Once the primordial chaos divided, the Three Realms took form. Though humans dwell between heaven and earth with small bodies, their spirit is vast; though their form is humble, their spirit is lofty. When Jade Toad once journeyed to the imperial court to present a memorial, the characters on the document were as small as millet grains. Yet upon reaching the celestial capital, those same characters grew as large as teacup saucers. Initially, while still in the human realm, the memorial’s paper was also quite short and narrow. But upon arriving in the heavens, it stretched over a *zhang* in height and two *zhang* in width. From this, we may understand the meaning of *The Hidden Words of the Great Brahma*: 'When clouds and *qi* coalesce, they form a mass over a *zhang* in size, where the Heavenly Perfected and August Ones take up their brushes to write.'\n\nLong ago, while perusing *The Records of Qingyuan*, I saw celestial script floating above Dragon Pool, inscribed with the words: 'Proclamation to the Black and Red,' revealed to the carp. Han Yu discerned it, saying: 'This is the decree by which the Supreme Lord beheaded the dragon,' and noted that each character was no larger than an inch. Yet one may suppose that in heaven, they were not merely an inch in size. Observing this now, there is no mystery—what appears vast in heaven transforms into vastness, while what manifests in miniature from the human realm remains small. It is like a person gazing into a mirror: a large mirror reflects a large face, a small mirror a small one.\n\nFrom this day forward, whenever preparing memorials on paper, ensure the sheets are one *chi* in height—no taller—and the characters as large as millet grains—no larger. This teaching is no deception.\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"I have long doubted whether refinement and deliverance are two separate matters—are they, or are they not?\"",

      "translated_text": "The answer said: \"The *Scripture of Salvation* states that 'deliverance in the living body is one,' and also that 'refinement of the dead soul is two.' Now examining the *Records of the Crimson Numinous Immortals and the Salvation of Lives*, we find: 'The Southern Prosperity Palace oversees two palaces: the Upper Palace and the Lower Palace. The Upper Palace governs the Bureau of Refinement, while the Lower Palace governs the Bureau of Deliverance. The living body resides in the lower realm, thus it is overseen by the Lower Palace; the dead soul ascends to the upper heavens, thus it is overseen by the Upper Palace.' Collectively, they are called the Crimson Numinous Fire Mansion, also known as the Southern Prosperity Bureau of Refinement and Deliverance. Today, when people speak of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace Refinement Bureau, the authentic officials and those who handle its affairs use the seal of the Refinement Bureau, yet it concurrently governs matters of deliverance for the living body through talismans and registers—this is truly without basis. Since it is called the Southern Prosperity Refinement Bureau, and yet is also termed the Upper Palace Refinement Bureau, this too is without basis. Henceforth, there is no need to speak of Upper or Lower Palaces, nor of refinement or deliverance; simply call it the Southern Prosperity Refinement and Deliverance Bureau, and use the original bureau’s seal, for this alone has a proper foundation. The seal’s inscription reads: *Seal of the Southern Prosperity Refinement and Deliverance Bureau*. It employs the standard interlocking seal script of the human realm, one *cun* and three *fen* in diameter.\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"What of the pacing of the stars?\"\nThe answer said: \"The pacing of the stars often follows the *Yu* step, and the *Yu* step consists of five, which harmonizes the Five Phases and, over time, enables ascension. Generally, the pacing of the stars uses five steps, advancing and retreating according to the generation and overcoming cycles of the Five Phases. One moves like a cat or dog crouching before a snake: advancing five steps, retreating five steps; advancing seven, retreating seven. The four directions follow the numbers of the Five Phases’ generation and completion. Only after the snake is subdued can it be harmed. Observe how a mouse is pounced upon in the same way. When a cat or dog stalks a snake, if during its advance or retreat it is disrupted or startled by a person, the moment it turns, the snake seizes the chance to harm it—this is because the pacing of the stars was incomplete. As with the methods of the Eight Gates and Hidden Movement in *Dun Jia*, the essence lies in the numinous power of the pacing of the stars!\n\nXiang asked: \"There are doubts about the yin and yang *dou* (constellations) as commonly transmitted.\"\nThe answer said: \"Today, people begin with the left foot for the initial star, reciting from *Kui* to *Piao* for the yang *dou*, and with the right foot for the initial star, reciting from *Tan* to *Po* for the yin *dou*. How mistaken! This is a baseless theory. The *Scripture of Flying Spirits to Pay Homage to the Dipper* states: 'Proceeding in order is yang, reversing is yin. From *Kui* to *E* is proceeding in order; from *Piao* to *Kui* is reversing.' The essential point is simply: 'If you wish to fly your spirit, do not stray from the Perfected One.' The Perfected One is the third star. All else is the *ding* step. The *ding* step is treading, while a single step is a point. If you say otherwise, I know not what to tell you.\"\n\nLu asked: \"Is it permissible to summon generals with shouts and rebukes?\"\nThe answer said: \"The elders have said: 'Revere them as lords and fathers, command them as servants.' The method of summoning generals and officials is to move spirit with spirit. If a person lacks authority, the spirits will not be complete. When summoning, one must wield the edict of the Supreme Lord, then issue commands to left and right as if the spirits were present. Only thus can one’s spirit command their spirits. The Perfected Master told Xiang: 'Now, simply carry one register, hold one office, practice one method, and issue documents for one bureau. Before the generals and officials of that bureau, use only one talisman and one water, for it is merely the meeting of heart and spirit—use it, and it will be efficacious. It is like a true dragon: a single drop of water becomes a torrential downpour. Why employ such complexity?'\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"In recent times, there are those who practice the Lingbao methods, and I do not say these methods do not exist; likewise, there are those who practice Yuantong methods, and I do not say these do not exist; and still others who practice Hunyuan methods, and I do not say these do not exist. Yet with so many schools and such complexity in incantations and techniques, they are not truly of the Orthodox Unity. In ancient times, the Orthodox Unity was transmitted as the teaching, so the methods practiced were simple and easy. Today, how does Lingbao differ from Yuantong? How does Yuantong differ from Hunyuan? How does Hunyuan differ from Orthodox Unity? The human heart is originally Yuantong, originally Lingbao, originally Orthodox Unity, originally Hunyuan. From the one heart of humanity flow endless methods, just as from the one *qi* of heaven all things are born. Yet some say Hunyuan is one stage, Lingbao another, Yuantong another, and Orthodox Unity yet another—like the cuckoo, which is called *zigu*, *xiebao*, *White Emperor’s Soul*, *Reflecting Mountain Red*, *Pounding Medicine Bird*, or *Shu Crow*, yet it is but one cuckoo.\"\n\nThe Perfected Master said: \"All methods arise from the heart; there is no separate method beyond the heart.\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"Recently, I have observed that alongside the Lingbao methods, there is also a school called Yuantong, and another called the Supreme Contending Brightness Court method, some using the Supreme *Mo Ming* Court seal, others the Yuantong seal. The seal’s inscription reads *Lingbao Yuantong, Hunhua Xuanmi*, with these eight characters arranged in the eight directions. At the center of the seal are the four characters *Bureau, Court, Ministry, Prefecture*. The inner inscription of the seal is round, the outer square, embodying the meaning of Yuantong. In my humble opinion, *Lingbao Yuantong, Hunhua Xuanmi* is the seal of the heart. Can these eight characters be fully expressed by this wooden seal? The *Bureau, Court, Ministry, Prefecture* are the spirit terrace—can this wooden seal represent these? Little do they realize that Lingbao is inherently Yuantong, and Yuantong is inherently *Leng Ming*. Why then seek branches and leaves, creating such complexity?\"",

      "translated_text": "Yuanchang asked: \"In the methods, how should one recite the invocations?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Invocation is the meaning of *zhu*. The intent of invocation is to communicate with the gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth. If this were so, then the good and evil invocations of the world would everywhere receive their due response. Yet today, it is not so—why? Because the true meaning of invocation is not understood. The croaking of frogs in a well clamoring to the Great Purity, the buzzing of ants in their burrows clamoring to the Lofty Spirits—these are no different from the invocations of people today. How could such invocations elicit a response?\n\nAs for the incantations in the methods: first, they are proclaimed by the Golden Mouth of the Supreme; second, they are often the banners and titles of the generals and officers. Thus, the essence of incantation lies in the *fǎfǎ* (method of methods). Therefore, when one sighs, the generals and officers follow, and the exalted perfected ones hear. Why, then, are the incantations of people today ineffective? Because they do not grasp the meaning of invocation. The meaning of incantation lies in treasuring the mind’s focus and the eye’s visualization—then the summoning of generals and officers is as if the divine were present before one.\"\n\nYuanchang asked: \"The *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* states: *Thirty-six above in Heaven, thirty-six below on Earth; the Great Mysterious is boundless, wondrous indeed is the Great Cavern Sutra.* Some take this to mean the two *hei* of yin and yang and the seventy-two seasonal nodes—is this correct?\"\n\nThe answer: \"This refers to matters within the human body. The *Níwán* corresponds to Heaven, belonging to *qián*; the number of *qián* is four; *qián* metal is *jiǎzǐ*, the number of metal is four, and *qián* employs nine. The *Wěilǘ* corresponds to Earth, belonging to *kūn*; the number of *kūn* is six, and *kūn* employs six. Thus, four nines make thirty-six, which is called 'above in Heaven,' and six sixes make thirty-six, which is called 'below on Earth.' This speaks of the thirty-six vessels in the human head and the thirty-six channels in the lower abdomen—Heaven and Earth are likewise. Only the human heart cannot be seen or heard, and so it is called 'the Great Mysterious, boundless, wondrous indeed—the Great Cavern.'\n\nLú asked: \"There are five precepts, the first of which is not to drink wine. Yet wine does not harm the Dao, though I fear it may cloud one’s nature. Should wine truly be forbidden?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The *Canon of Scriptures* states in the words of the Supreme: *Those of great talent and heroic refinement are only addicted to wine; the fermented brew fumes the heart, inverting nature and temperament, destroying the ten virtues and giving rise to the ten evils. The four thoroughfares are laid waste, and the six penetrations are blocked.*\n\nThe true master told his disciple: *The female immortal È Lǜhuá said to Yáng Quán: ‘The scholar of the Dao regards brocade as filth, sees rank and office as a passing traveler, and views gold and jade as tiles and pebbles.

Even if sealed in a secure place, should anything draw them, they flee and vanish—just as pepper penetrates mercury. Nowadays, people’s essence and marrow are often seized by lust, leading to exhaustion. Alas!\"\n\nThe true master said: \"My former teacher, Chen Niju, once served at the Huizong Court. There, he encountered the Great Cavern Perfected, Master Sun, who told him: *In ancient times, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning and the Most High Lord Lao compiled the scriptures they had expounded, gathering and arranging them into a canon.

Śākyamuni manifested as the Filthy-Trace Vajra to subdue the Conch-Crested Brahmā King, and thus this teaching was transmitted to vanquish demons and restrain heterodox paths. It relies solely on the thirty-three-syllable *Golden Wheel Filthy-Trace Mantra*. Within their school, the Medicine King Nāgārjuna assists them. Beyond this, there are the two great sages of Fragrant Mountain and Snow Mountain, the two great sages of Pig’s Head and Elephant’s Trunk, the two great sages of Mighty Might and Splendid Light, as well as Prince Nawen, King Dingshu, the Deep Sand Spirit, and the *Gatī* Spirit—all supporting their dharma. They are aided by vajra *yakṣas* and enforcers, though their generals number only four: Tiger *Garuḍa*, Horse *Garuḍa*, Ox-Head *Garuḍa*, and Golden-Head *Garuḍa*. No others exist.\n\nYet today’s false masters mingle terms from various Daoist methods, stomp their steps, twist their fingers, shout at the top of their lungs, leap wildly, shake bells and chimes, whip hemp snakes, and strike peachwood staves—greatly distorting the ancient teachings. This is hardly what Śākyamuni intended! Nevertheless, *Yuqie* remains one of the Buddha’s methods for subduing demons.\"\n\nI asked: \"In the countryside, many abstain from meat and observe fasts to serve the *Mingjiao*, calling it *demon-destruction*. Their followers claim it as the legacy of the Most High Lord Lao. Is this true or false?\"\nHe replied: \"Long ago in the state of Sulin, there lived a layman named Moge. Initially, he failed in his pursuit of immortality, and later, he did not succeed in Buddhism. He withdrew to the Great Nāga Mountain, where he encountered an outer-path messenger from the Western Heaven named *Ripipojia Ming*. This messenger taught him a method to cultivate, and thus this teaching was left behind. In truth, it is irrational.\n\nTheir doctrine includes a prohibition, claiming that the entire earth—mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, water, and fire—is the *Dharmakāya* of Vairocana. Thus, they dare not tread upon or disturb anything. Yet even so, they stand *outside* the body of Vairocana’s *Dharmakāya*. Their practices—observing the eight fasts, worshiping the five directions—are merely precepts imposed by their teachings.\n\nTheir hierarchy consists of three ranks: the Heavenly King, the Illuminating Messenger, and the Numinous Form Earth Deity, who govern the teaching. Its essence lies in the eight characters: *clarity, strife, radiance, power, wisdom, and might*. Yet these eight characters originate from the mind. Can one who clings to forms in cultivation truly embody them? Moreover, they call it the *Mingjiao* (Teaching of Light), yet they themselves remain benighted.\"\n\nThe true master said: \"Whether ordinary or sacred, it is like a shadow following form—one becomes many, and many become one. Like the sun and moon reflected in myriad waters, their light is fundamentally undivided. Yet they arise with the water and appear with the eye. A single water with a thousand eyes yields a thousand suns and moons; a single water with one eye yields one sun and moon. A thousand waters with one eye yield one sun and moon; a thousand waters with a thousand eyes yield a thousand suns and moons. Like a shadow following form, it is ever thus. You cannot grasp it, nor can you abandon it; neither grasping nor abandoning, it remains unattainable.\"\n\nI asked: \"The so-called *yin elixir* and *yang elixir*—are these external elixirs or internal elixirs?\"\nHe replied: \"External elixirs are difficult to refine and yield no success; internal elixirs are easy to refine and bear fruit. The *yin elixir* and *yang elixir* are both internal elixirs. The *elixir* is the heart; the heart is the spirit. The *yang spirit* is called the *yang elixir*; the *yin spirit* is called the *yin elixir*—yet both are internal elixirs.\n\n*Yang spirit* enables *shedding the mortal coil and changing the bones*, a body beyond the body. When gathered, it takes form; when dispersed, it becomes shadow. *Yin spirit* is a single thought of pure numinosity, where the soul and consciousness have not yet scattered—like a dream, like a shadow, akin to a ghost. Those who cultivate the elixir must understand this.\"\n\nThe true master instructed Yuanchang: \"*The Red Spirit Jade Text* states: *The Eastern Pole of Precious Splendor, the Western Pole of Grand Purity, the Northern Pole for Driving Away Evil, the Southern Pole of the Celestial Pivot*—these are the Four Poles, while the Central Pole of the Five Thunders truly governs their affairs.

      "translated_text": "Hmph!\n\nLu asked: \"Recently, I have heard of the *Yuantong* method and have privately harbored doubts about it. Its talismanic seals are round on the inside and square on the outside, with the Five Agents at the center and the Eight Trigrams surrounding them. The provincial and prefectural offices, as well as the various bureaus, are arrayed at the four directions. It takes the four characters *Lingbao Yuantong* as its宗 and *Hunhua Xuanmi* as its本. It cobbles together talismans, diagrams, incantations, and oral instructions from various methods to forge a single system, calling it the *Great Yuantong Method*. Does the master affirm this or not?\"\n\nThe master replied: \"The spirit has no fixed form, hence it is called *round*; the primordial has no fixed substance, hence it is called *penetrating*. In ancient times, the teaching of *Yuantong* referred to the fusion of spirit and *qi*, issuing forth into the formless and returning to primordial chaos. If one now takes shapes, instruments, trigrams, and numbers as its basis, how far removed is this from true *Yuantong*? Moreover, such a method did not exist in antiquity. Alas! The errors of false masters are not the fault of sentient beings.\"\n\nThe true master addressed Xiang: \"Do you know of the two envoys, *Qingyang* and *Tuoluo*, within the Dipper?\"\n\nXiang replied: \"I would hear of this.\"\n\nThe master said: \"*Qingyang* is a human term; in the heavens, it is the sound of *Zhangshan* (Upholding Goodness). *Tuoluo* is a human expression; in the heavens, it is the word *Duda* (Great Assembly). The *Qingyang* envoy holds a jade vase and a golden lotus; the *Tuoluo* envoy carries a golden tray and a censer of *baixieshou* incense. The views of the vulgar world are mistaken indeed!\"\n\nThe true master said: \"My former master once remarked: 'What great joy exists in the human realm!' Yet suffering and joy ever follow one another in cycles. Joy does not last a hundred years, but suffering endures for ten thousand kalpas. In this world, those with wealth cling to it unto death, while those without it beg unto death. I have never seen men contend with wealth for their lives rather than contend with their lives for wealth.\"\n\nHmph! The true master addressed Yuanchang: \"Do you know that all the methods I teach are methods of the heart?\"\n\nYuanchang replied: \"I know this.\"\n\nThe master asked: \"What then is the heart?\"\n\nYuanchang said: \"I do not know.\"\n\nThe master said: \"If you do not know, how can you practice?\"\n\nYuanchang replied: \"All dharmas are none other than methods of the heart.\"\n\nThe master said: \"Then practice for now. With time, you will know; knowing, you will not know; not knowing, you will know. Though you do not know, how is this different from knowing?\"\n\nUpon hearing these words, Xiang and Yuanchang leapt with joy, moved to sorrow, and awakened profoundly. Master Haiqiong rose with a smile.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial of Transmission and Thanksgiving**\n\nTo the Supreme Divine *Shenxiao* Jade-Pure Prefecture, Commander of Thunder and Lightning, Marshal of the Five Thunder Generals, and Director of the Thunder Bureau’s Ghosts and Spirits:\n\nYour servant, Yu Chan, respectfully states: On the fifteenth day of this month, we humbly submit this memorial on behalf of Peng Xiang, Envoy of the Supreme Clarity Great Flower Cinnabar Scenery Office and Scribe of the Divine *Shenxiao* Jade Prefecture’s Western Terrace, Acting Judge of the Xiandu Wind and Thunder Bureau; your servant, Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Mysterious Capital Three Sceneries Dharma Master, Grand Master of the *Taiyi* Thunder Register, Ninefold Numinous Flying Paces Transcendent Official, and Signatory of the Various Bureaus’ Dharma Courts for Ghosts and Spirits; your servant, Liu Yuanchang, Orthodox Unity Alliance-Wei Dharma Master, Acting Judge of the Expelling Demons Court, Southern Chang Register Keeper, Ninefold Numinous Flying Paces Transcendent Official, concurrently Director of the Thunder Bureau’s Ghosts and Spirits; your servant, Lin Boqian, Registrant of the Supreme *Sanwu* Merit and Service Record, Right Attendant Scripture Keeper of the Divine *Shenxiao* Jade Prefecture; your servant, Pan Changji, Registrant of the Supreme *Sanwu* Merit and Service Record, Right Attendant Scripture Keeper of the Divine *Shenxiao* Jade Prefecture; your servant, Zhou Xiqing, Disciple of the Supreme *Sanwu* Merit and Service Dharma Record, Practitioner of the Heavenly Heart Orthodox Dharma and Acting Judge of the Expelling Demons Court, concurrently Managing the Five Thunder Envoys’ Court; your servant, Hu Shijian, Orthodox Unity Alliance-Wei Dharma Master, Practitioner of the Supreme Clarity *Hunyuan* Heavenly Heart Five Thunder Great Dharma, appointed to Direct the Expelling Demons Court, concurrently Managing the Thunder Bureau; your servant, Luo Zhida, Disciple of the Supreme *Sanwu* Merit and *Zixu Yangguang* Secret Record, Practitioner of the Supreme Clarity Northern Culmen Heavenly Heart Orthodox Dharma, Golden Watchtower Inner Terrace Refiner and Transformer, Right Judge of the Expelling Demons Court; your servant, Chen Shoumo, Orthodox Unity Alliance-Wei Dharma Master, Practitioner of the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Heart Jade Dawn Five Thunder Great Dharma, Ninefold Numinous Flying Paces Transcendent Official, Director of the Expelling Demons Yellow Register Court; your servant, Zhuang Zhirong, and others—having been entrusted with the Daoist methods, we have memorialized and received imperial approval to register and confer the aforementioned appointments.\n\nWe humbly submit that the Dharma has its orthodox transmission, fortunately inherited through the master’s teachings, and offices are never conferred in vain, for we aspire to repay the celestial grace.

      "translated_text": "Your servants, ephemeral as cicadas, ignorant as ants—unworthily numbered among the people of the Central Kingdom, we owe our very existence to the great Potter’s craft. Gazing up at the encompassing embrace of Heaven and Earth, bathed in the radiance of sun and moon, we sit and eat in shame, for what merit have we rendered unto the world?\n\nTracing back through kalpas untold to this present life, we possess this body and have reached this moment—yet the three evil and unwholesome deeds—killing, stealing, and lustful transgressions—along with the six roots clouded by ignorance, greed, hatred, and delusion, have amassed sins vast as the sea and karmic burdens heavier than mountains. By the grace of the Supreme Perfected Ones, who opened the gates of repentance and confession, even the most foolish are granted a path to lay bare their faults. Thus, past transgressions are absolved, and future calamities are averted.\n\nYet, in our dim-witted devotion, we have failed the molding hands of the Dao. From early affinity with the Way, we encountered the *Divine Empyrean Five Thunder Scriptures*; as mortals yearning for transcendence, we received the *Supreme Highest Ninefold Numinous Decrees*. Thereby, we came to grasp seals within our palms and dispatch talismans with our brushes, commanding wind and thunder, distinguishing between humans and spirits, aiding the living and delivering the dead, upholding the upright and expelling the perverse. How could we dare, mired in the dust of the mundane hall, to tread upon the celestial pivot of the *Big Dipper*?\n\nSince ancient times, transmission and reception have been thus; today, we humbly uphold and practice them. Internally, we refine the elixir; externally, we accumulate merit and conduct. Embodying Heaven’s transformative power, we assist the state and succor the people.\n\nWe reverently consider the *Highest Supreme Divine Empyrean Jade Pure Perfected King*, the *Great Emperor of Longevity*—whose Dao is vast and ineffable, whose virtue is boundless and all-pervading, parent to all beings, lunar preceptor of the celestial realms. He orders the nine streams before the myriad harmonies, governs the eight directions beyond the vastness of the firmament, extending compassion to save the world and employing skillful means to deliver humanity.\n\nYour servants, though but scribes in the Eastern Terrace and minor functionaries in the Western Bureau, have studied the rites of dividing talismans and breaking contracts, performed the ceremonies of pledging with blood and imbibing cinnabar, and sworn to lead the generals and officials in achieving extraordinary merit—all relying on the talismanic charts to propagate the great teachings. May Your profound benevolence, in hidden and subtle ways, deign to look upon us. We pray to sweep clean the dust of seas and mountains, seal the caves of demons and malevolent spirits, and open the gates of emptiness and non-being, that the winds of *Orthodox Unity* may once more flourish.\n\nPresuming upon the awe of Heaven, we obey and receive the Emperor’s mandate. Should we be granted Your sheltering protection, we shall proceed with our undertakings. Though our bodies have not yet attained perfect realization, the black embryo still requires the *Jade Black*; though our spirits have not yet entered the wondrous, the *Heavenly Heart* must harmonize with celestial wanderings.\n\nWith utmost reverence and trepidation, your servants humbly present this memorial for Your august perusal.",

      "translated_text": "Kowtow! Prostrate bow! Reverently bowing again, I humbly submit:\n\nMemorial presented by your subject Yu Chan, of indeterminate rank, on a day in the tenth month of the eleventh year of Jiading in the year *wuyin* of the Great Cycle.\n\n**Three Poems from the Divine Empyrean**\n\nVast and distant, the Divine Empyrean,\nWhen shall dawn break over the Jade Capital?\nJade flowers glisten with dew-laden elixir,\nJewel trees whisper in the wind’s refrain.\n\nJade consorts attend the cloud-scriptures,\nFeathered lads dance with golden plumes.\nAlas, the people of this world below,\nChasing red dust in vain, day after day.\n\nPurple jade soars over the Pure Metropolis,\nEmerald clouds guard the crimson palace gates.\nNo stars are seen—only sun and moon,\nGazing down upon the earth below.\n\nTwo thousand years have passed in this world,\nDaring not speak of it to mortal ears.\nI have already refined the Golden Elixir,\nLeaving behind the secret of flying immortality.\n\nScribes of the Jade Emperor’s incense table,\nMinisters of the Golden Gates’ forbidden walls,\nPrecious censers simmer with sun and moon,\nIron rods lash thunder and lightning.\n\nAt dawn, I refine the clouds of Western Mountains,\nAt night, I brew the stars of the Northern Dipper.\nTo the tree spirit south of the city, I declare:\n\"My home lies in the Jade Capital.\"\n\nMy master, Lord Haiqiong,\nFlew his monastic staff between Mount Kang and Lu.\nIn the spring of *wuyin* in Jiading,\nA letter summoned me to the Wuyi Mountains.\nI, bound by clan duties,\nReceived an official summons to the capital.\nI departed in summer and returned in autumn,\nHiring a boat to seek our covenant—\nYet he was nowhere to be found.\nThus, I left these three poems as a record.\n\nIt was said: My wife, Zhou Xiqing, rode here in tandem.\nOn the Double Ninth of that year,\nZiyuanzi left his eldest son, Yuanshan, skilled in calligraphy.\nBefore the *Zhizhi* Hermitage, along the Nine-Bend Stream,\nI moored my boat to gaze at the slanting sunlight.\nI asked passersby if the master had returned—\nOnly to see dragons and serpents soaring on the walls.\n\nThe true master’s traces vanished,\nHis brushwork alive upon the walls.\nI strode to seek the Bone-Transforming Cliff,\nBut found only his discarded husk interred in a jade casket.\nWas Ziyuan not destined for immortality?\nYet who would guide me now?\n\nToday, precisely the Double Ninth,\nWind carries osmanthus fragrance from the grotto.\nWith my wife, I gathered chrysanthemums,\nReturning to fill our cups with ninefold rosy clouds.\n\n**Immortal Lyrics Presented to Ziyuan**\n\nRiding a jade turtle by night to pluck the bright moon,\nIn the elixir hall of the jade terrace, the cold pierces to the bone.\nThe thirty-six heavens never close their gates—\nWind scatters jade flowers like flying petals.\n\nFrom whose flute does the melody arise?\nEighty thousand *nishang*-clad beings sing *White Snow*.\nThe Purple Emperor, having feasted, prepares to depart,\nAdjusting his robes and holding his tablet to pay court.\n\nThe Fire-Link General barks a command—\nTen thousand immortals to his left and right bristle.\nHe petitions: \"Your servant was once an officer of thunder,\nBanished for an offense from the cinnabar gates.\nBuried in red dust up to my ears,\nI ate greens and drank dew, keeping strict austerities.\nNow, my spirit ascends to heaven parched with thirst—\nIf the Emperor has wine, let me take but a sip,\nGranting your servant a drunken release to return home.\"\n\nReturning to the mortal world, I tell others:\nAt the Phoenix Pavilion, I inquired about the way back.\nJade lads and jade maidens asked me:\n\"In heaven, the days are long and the Great Purity vast—\nIs the mortal world at all like this?\"\nI shook my head, gave no answer, and brushed my sleeves,\nWhite clouds stretching endlessly, veiling the Pure Metropolis.\nIn the grotto, gibbons and cranes recognize one another,\nWhite stones gleam while green pines wither.\n\n**Thirty Poems from Huayang**\n\nMy home lies on Qiong Isle, ten thousand leagues away,\nThis body comes and goes like a solitary boat.\nLast night, in a dream, I rode the west wind home—\nGazing toward my homeland, tears streamed in vain.\n\nThe southern seas are a realm of water and clouds,\nTen years have blurred my vision with longing.\nIn fleeting moments of reflection,\nThe west wind and evening sun choke the sad cicadas.\n\nSince parting from the southern seas’ boat,\nMy body has followed the clouds to Jiang-Zhe’s skies.\nI’ve wandered through grotto-heavens seeking recluses—\nI wonder how many straw sandals I’ve worn through.\n\nWhite clouds accompanied me to Tiantai,\nMy eyes met green mountains, my heart opened wide.\nYet upon reaching those peaks, new longings arose—\nEverywhere, the night apes’ cries bring sorrow.\n\nLeaning on my staff, I entered Wuyi,\nBeneath Manting Peak, snowflakes flew.\nWalking along the Nine-Bend Rapids,\nTen thousand ravines and a thousand cliffs encircled me in emerald.\n\nIn Wuyi, I built a thatched hut for two years,\nFlowers smiled, orioles sang—spring in a flask.\nStream water flowed down the mountain, people emerged from grottoes,\nBefore the cliff, only the empty alchemy furnace remained.\n\nHaving obtained the formula, I returned to test refinement—\nDragons and tigers clashed in an instant.\nIf the people of Jiuhua Peak knew,\nA single night’s wind and thunder would shake ten thousand mountains.\n\nAt the White Horse River’s head, I let out a roar—\nCrimson light and purple mist arose from the water.\nQuickly, I drew the green-snake sword from its scabbard—\nOnly then did the Yellow River run clear to its depths.\n\nI drank hundreds of goblets of golden waves,\nWhen drunk, I brandished my sword toward the void.\nMy feet playfully tread the *Qian* and *Dou* constellations,\nA long whistle—heaven and earth turned red.\n\nI moved the Northern Dipper past the Southern Asterism,\nWith both hands, I lifted the sun and moon.\nFlying to Kunlun’s summit,\nIn an instant, I transformed into a cloud covering the sky.\n\nPlayfully sailing a golden boat to the sea’s edge,\nSecretly following the sea’s waters through flowing sands.\nOnce I stepped onto Penglai’s shore,\nI went to admire the flowers of the Jade Terrace and Celestial Gardens.\n\nThe human body itself contains a Penglai,\nTwelve-tiered towers with white jade steps.\nThe Crimson Maiden and Golden Boy often meet in the tower,\nBefore the hall, peonies bloom every night.\n\nA strange matter that makes one laugh several times:\nNow even men can conceive.\nTheir own essence and blood unite in congress—\nWithin the body, husband and wife are wondrous indeed!\n\nOne chant, one drunkenness, one *daogui* of elixir,\nTrue *qi* and true essence fill the four limbs.\nWhen wine’s warmth lulls me to deep sleep,\nMy boat, laden with treasures, sails past Caoxi.\n\nThe primordial spirit lodges nightly in the cinnabar field,\nClouds fill the Yellow Court, the moon fills the sky.\nTwo mandarin ducks float on green waters—\nIn the water’s heart, a single purple-gold lotus.\n\nHungry, I eat a morsel of black turtle liver,\nCold, I turn to the cinnabar field’s raging fire mountain.\nSeeing no affairs in my heart,\nI know not that the world suffers hunger and cold.\n\nThe Green Ox Man departed how many years ago?\nThis Dao lies clearly before our eyes.\nIf you wish to recognize the true state before you—\nA hall where wind is cool and the moon is fair.\n\nIn a moment’s effort, I refine mercury and lead,\nA furnace’s fierce fire burns the night sky.\nSuddenly, divine water falls into the golden well—\nFusing the numinous cinnabar, round as the moon.\n\nA pool of divine water fills the Hua Pond,\nNightly, white snow flies by its edge.\nWithin the snow, someone seizes the jade hare,\nDriving the bright moon to ascend the cold branch.",

He performed the Yellow Register rites.\n\nAt dawn on that day, the preceptor approached with incense tucked in his sleeve, bowing deeply in reverence. His words were as follows:\n“Since your departure from Min, I have practiced the Dao day and night, never daring to be idle. Yet Heaven, silent, has taken what I cherished. Recently, I submitted a memorial to inquire after the Dao, only to find what I valued already lost. I beg you, Master, to take pity.\nAt the moment of his passing, thunder roared and winds howled, filling the house with an extraordinary fragrance. Outside, the day was clear, yet no one heard a sound—his death seemed unlike others’. When we buried him, unbroken rain fell for days, then suddenly cleared. After the burial, the rain returned. Even the locals noted the strangeness.\nI presumptuously used the yellow thread for purification. Now that you have descended, Master, may the yellow thread’s purpose be fulfilled. The Three Realms will rejoice! The myriad spirits will celebrate!”\n\nThe Patriarch replied: “My disciple, there is no need for such excessive courtesy. Today is the Lantern Festival; I immediately ordered the establishment of a purification hall, the erection of a Jade Hall, and the installation of a Jade Casket Office, along with a Yellow Thread Bureau. From *chen* to *shen*, documents were prepared, oaths sworn to Heaven and Earth, and a memorial tablet planted at the gate.\nI appointed Xuanyi Zhao Rukuai as High Ritual Master, Zishu Lin Shizhong as Chief Lecturer, Ziguang Lin Boqian as Supervisor of the Vegetarian Feast, Fang Hao Jing’an as Attendant Sutra-Bearer, Yuling Deng Daoning as Attendant Incense-Bearer, Yuhua Chen Milong as Attendant Lamp-Bearer, Zihu Xie Xiandao as Altar Steward, Ziqiong Zhao Shoufu as Procession Overseer. I myself acted as the Supreme Clarity Yellow Register Envoy, serving as General Supervisor.\nThe appointments were to be finalized on the last day of the first month, the rites performed on the first day of the second month, the jiao completed on the fourth day, thanksgiving offered on the fifth, and the Thunder Rites held on the sixth. All fast and jiao rituals followed ancient forms, with nine-morning ceremonies conducted as usual.”\nThe preceptor assented daily.\n\nOn the first day of the second month, *gengchen*, at dawn, a torrential downpour began. The rain persisted for three days, the skies dark and stormy, continuing through three days and nights of the nine-morning rites. Yet as soon as the procession began to ascend for the audience, the skies cleared. Once the morning rites concluded, the rain returned—this pattern held for all nine mornings.\nOn the second day, *xinsi*, at *you*, as the memorial was presented, people worried over the rain. Just as the memorial was prostrated, the rain abruptly ceased. Clouds gathered on all sides, yet above the altar, the Northern Aster shone brightly, while outside, the rain fell as before. When the rites concluded, rain poured down upon the altar, and the onlookers rejoiced.\n\nThe Patriarch said: “The alternation of yin and yang is Heaven’s affair—mere coincidence. Why worry? Why rejoice?”\nOn the third day, *renwu*, at dawn, something was seen within the family shrine, believed to be the arrival of ancestral spirits. The preceptor, overjoyed, rushed in to report. The Patriarch swiftly stopped him, saying: “Let it be. The Great Dao is formless and does not favor apparitions. The Dharma is but the function of the Dao—it can summon the unseen. If someone sees something today, what is strange about that?”",

      "translated_text": "Someone asked: “After the jiao rites concluded, the Welcoming of the Perfected and the Proclamation of Amnesty were completed, the skies cleared as they had been before the rites. Yet for the entire nine-day period—from beginning to end—there were three full days and nights of overcast rain. Why was this so?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied: “From ancient times to the present, when the Yellow Register Retreat is held, there is often gloomy weather. This is because the suffering souls of the hidden realm emerge from the gates of yin. Such conditions arise naturally in response to the rites.\n\nOn the seventh day, *bingxu*, the various divine officials were summoned, and the sacrifice to Thunder was performed. When the rites concluded, the sacrificial animals and wine-meats were buried in the *xun* direction along with the cinnabar talismans. It was agreed that when thunder sounded after three days, the talismans would be unearthed and placed in the Crane Grove Retreat.\n\nThat year, from the preceding winter, there had been no rain, making wheat planting difficult. With this Yellow Register Retreat, the earth received moisture. After the jiao rites, a thanksgiving feast was held in the oratory, and the divine officials were credited with their merits.\n\nThe Preceptor offered his gratitude, saying: “Master, in conducting these jiao rites, you have done what the people of this region have never witnessed, and what I have gained is beyond measure! The blessings bestowed upon the living have also been abundant. Your conduct has been flawless, your teachings like medicine and stone to the heart—unprecedented, unparalleled. Yet whenever reports of divine marvels or numinous wonders arise, you always suppress them. Why is this?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied: “It is mere coincidence. Why indulge in joy? I neither rejoice in their presence nor worry over their absence. I simply know to practice the Dao and uphold the Dharma, allowing things to unfold naturally. The reason for this is that I rely on sincerity to penetrate all responses and depend on the Dharma to carry out the affairs. What cause is there for joy or worry in between? If such thoughts arise, they only disrupt my right mindfulness.”\n\nSomeone asked: “What is the meaning of the *Yellow Register*?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied: “The deliverance of the Nine Yin realms from suffering employs the methods of the *Golden Register* and *White Writs*. The *Golden Register* is the *Yellow Register*, and for this reason, Heaven too has established a *Yellow Register* Court. *Yellow* is the origin of all colors; *Register* is the talisman of the myriad Perfected. This signifies that the principle of the Yellow Center governs qi, commands the myriad Perfected, guides souls from darkness to light, and saves the living while delivering the dead. *Register* also means *record*—it is the ledger of ghosts and spirits. *Yellow* also signifies *mastery*—it is the governance of the affairs of ghosts and spirits. Thus, the ghosts and spirits of the hidden realms have a master to oversee and record them.”\n\nThe Preceptor asked: “The Dipper is the Emperor’s Chariot, revolving at the center and overseeing the four directions to inspect portents. Thus, the scriptures say: ‘The Great Culmen of the Central Dipper supervises all spirits.’ The original scripture also states: ‘The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper are the great deities of the celestial center.’ The *Discourses of Lu* likewise says: ‘Like the North Star, all stars encircle it.’ If this is so, then the Dipper’s Pole is the image of the Unmatched, for it governs the entire starry river. Yet some ask: If the Dipper resides at the center of Heaven, why is it called the *Northern* Dipper?”\n\n“They do not realize that the Dipper’s handle begins its rotation at *zi* and completes it at *hai*, cycling day and night without end, ever pointing north—hence the name *Northern Dipper*. As for the *Southern Dipper*, it is merely the first of the northern lodgings among the Twenty-Eight Constellations and cannot compare to the Northern Dipper. In recent times, people have been misled by the name *Southern Dipper*, depicting it in red and even placing it above the Northern Dipper—how grave an error!\n\n“Others ask: The Dipper constellation lies within the degrees of the Twenty-Eight Constellations in the north. Why is it called the *Southern* Dipper? They do not realize that the Wall is in the north yet called the *Eastern Wall*, and the Well is in the south yet called the *Eastern Well*—this can be understood through reflection. How does this principle apply?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied: “Indeed, it is so!”",

      "translated_text": "According to the *Zhou Tian Star Chart*, the armillary sphere, and both ancient and modern astronomical texts, none mention the Southern Dipper as positioned above the Northern Dipper, nor do they recognize the name *Southern Dipper* at all. This is merely a concept within Daoism, referring to the *Six Offices of the Southern Dipper*—perhaps hidden stars in the heavens, yet unverifiable through investigation. According to ritual texts, the *Secret Taboo Names of the Southern Dipper* state [text missing], attributing it to the Southern Pole, the jurisdiction of the *Vermilion Numinous Fire Department* and the *Fire Bell Office*. There is also the *Inner Taboo Names of the Southern Dipper*, which reads: *Zhana Banqu Dahei*—thus confirming the existence of the Southern Dipper. If one wished to erase it, what would become of the scriptures?\n\nDushi asked: The five planets and six luminaries exhibit transgressions such as wandering, concealment, encroachment, and violations, as well as anomalies like rebelliousness, proximity, and eclipses—these are truly tied to disasters, calamities, and misfortunes. Those who perform rituals to avert disaster and transcend calamity must make petitions regarding them. Petitions are permissible, but one must establish their lamps according to celestial patterns! According to the *Essentials of the Golden Register*, all lamps have their prescribed forms. Yet why is there no prescribed form for these lamps? It is not an omission. For *Rahu*, *Ketu*, *Ziqi*, and *Comet* are hidden luminaries in the sky—those are concealed, while these are manifest. What does this mean?\n\nThe Patriarch replied: For example, in the lamp pattern of the Northern Dipper, the Right Assistant Star is also a hidden luminary, and thus no lamp is established for it—there are only eight lamps. *Rahu* is the residual blackness of fire, *Ketu* the residual qi of earth, *Comet* the residual qi of metal and water, and *Ziqi* the residual blackness of wood. Now, if we maintain the lamps for the eleven luminaries, there is no need to establish lamps for these four—it suffices!\n\nDushi said: Before ascending, the Han Celestial Master told people: “If anyone brings two *dou* of rice, I will explain things for them, just as Confucius never refused instruction to those who offered even a bundle of dried meat.” Thus, he was called the *Master of the Dou of Rice*. Today, many cite the *Scripture of Salvation*, which states: “Noble adepts offer gold and treasures, pledging their hearts to the heavens in transmission.” Yet they still greedily accept bribes and demand the full array of altar rituals. Why? Because nothing is harder to relinquish than one’s own wealth—hence the saying, “Food is heaven, wealth is life.” Thus, requiring them to contribute gold and treasures, or display silk banners, is meant to test their willingness to part with what they find most difficult to give up, thereby revealing their sincerity. If greed arises in their hearts, they have already lost the original intent!\n\nIt is also said: In a single altar ritual, the memorial to the heavens is of utmost importance. If the officiant possesses the Way of communicating with the true and attaining the numinous, then every petition will reach its destination. Thus, at the beginning of the *Welcoming the True*, the *Proclamation of Admonition* is recited; after *Sending Off the True*, the memorial is burned. In recent years, after the *Welcoming the True* and the *Proclamation of the Memorial*, the memorial is instead brought out to the central courtyard to be burned. For instance, if the true are welcomed from the north, yet the memorial is proclaimed here, then taken out and burned—why? From this, it is clear that the officiant lacks the practice of *visualization*—this is certain!\n\nThe Patriarch said: The *Jade Mirror of the Numinous Treasure* states: The *Treasure Banner for Translocating Spirits* should be dyed with *fei* color, with the taboo names of the Three Clarities inscribed on both sides, and the characters *Treasure Banner for Translocating Spirits* written on the banner’s body. Today, though the color remains the same, the dimensions differ, the calligraphy varies, and it is named the *Treasure Banner for Translocating Spirits* at dusk—this is incorrect. Furthermore, in ancient methods, two banners were placed within the *Lamp Wheel of the Five Sufferings and Nine Hells*, and during the *Summoning*, they were positioned before the incense and music—these two banners served a purpose. Now, they are merely erected at the gate for decoration, ignorant of their use!\n\nFor example, the *Yellow Banner of the Grand Return in the Supreme Subtlety* has its proper banner form, and the *Numinous Banner of the Command of Wu Ying* has its own banner form. Yet today, none understand their significance, and whether they are banners or flags is scarcely distinguishable.\n\nIt is also said: According to the *Disciplinary Texts of the Yellow Register*, when the summoned souls of the deceased arrive, one should cultivate benevolent thoughts to deliver them, not weep sorrowfully to harm their spirits. The ritual master must issue strict warnings beforehand; if the warnings are not stern, it is a violation of the precepts. This is the true intent of delivering the dead. The natural human inclination is to cling to life and fear death—if one cannot equalize life and death, who can forget their own mortality? As long as a single thought of attachment remains, liberation is impossible. Thus, the Supreme Lord’s intent in delivering beings is first to shatter their fear of death. Yet today, not only do they fail to restrain sorrowful weeping, but they artfully feign grief, inducing tears to deepen confusion and delusion.\n\nIt is also recorded in the *Great Method of the Five Thunders of the Divine Empyrean*: The *White Memorial of the Three Heavenly Lords of the Three Primes* is one; the *Golden Writ of the Middle Prime* and the *Precious Proclamation of the Nine Heavens* is another; the *Register of Ascending the True and Delivering Life* and the *Talisman for Departing from Life and Death* is yet another. Though memorials, talismans, proclamations, and registers bear different names, they all serve the Supreme Lord’s purpose of delivering all beings. Yet today, the *proclamation* of *announcement* is confused with the *proclamation* of *official rank*, and the *White Memorial* along with the *Talisman of Ascending the True* are all included and bestowed upon the deceased. What use could they possibly have for these?\n\nIt is further said: The *Talismans of Salvation from Suffering and Longevity* possess immense efficacy. Since they are called *primordial talismanic commands*, how can they be treated lightly? Thus, the *Lu Zhen Official* must submit a petition requesting them, and upon their completion, they are secretly transmitted to the Three Officials and the Thirty-Six Prisons. Yet today, it is not so—their inscription is not preceded by a petition, nor is their completion followed by secret transmission. Moreover, they are handed over to others, and the high priest is not involved! The worldly tradition claims these two talismans possess great efficacy in delivering the dead, requiring one talisman per deliverance, whether ten, a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand—all are tallied, and none dare be omitted.",

Why is it called the *Southern* Dipper? They do not realize that the Wall is in the north yet called the *Eastern Wall*, and the Well is in the south yet called the *Eastern Well*—this can be understood through reflection. How does this principle apply?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied: “Indeed, it is so!”",

      "translated_text": "I have privately observed that the white slips are but wood, and the red script but cinnabar. If mere white wood and red cinnabar could deliver the dead, then none beneath the Nine Springs would remain undelivered. Alas! Whether the divine is made manifest depends upon the person. If it is not the right person, the Dao does not operate in vain. Were all practitioners truly those who penetrate the real and comprehend the numinous, and possessed a sincere heart to aid the living and deliver the dead, then even a single talisman or slip would suffice to deliver ten thousand souls and more!\n\nIt is further said: According to the *Ancient Rituals of Petitions* and the *Continued Rituals of Petitions*, the formats of all petitions are provided so that later generations may have a standard to follow. Yet today, it is not so—a petition is copied in its entirety from an ancient text, not daring to alter a single character. If this were the case, then the ancients who submitted petitions must all have memorized the words within them—would this not have been an easy task? Submitting, prostrating before, preserving, and presenting a petition all share the same intent. If one cannot do so, then merely saying \"burn the petition\" would suffice! Instead, the task is delegated to the Generals, Talisman Clerks, Merit Officers, and Envoys, who are relied upon to transmit it.\n\nWhen setting up an offering and presenting a petition, each has their own duties, so that they may focus. Thus, the mind is free of distracting thoughts, the body free of extraneous tasks, embracing the primordial and guarding the One. As the *Lu Zhen Official* said: \"Seven days before the offering, nothing unrelated to the rite may be undertaken.\" Only then may it be performed. Yet today, it is not so—there are those who attend a funeral in the morning and perform a petition offering in the evening, those who submit petitions on behalf of their masters without changing the names, who do not select the proper day or time, do not distinguish directions, do not differentiate between dawn and dusk, and are ignorant of taboos. Such actions hasten misfortune from Heaven—how can one not be cautious!\n\nLin Boqian asked: May I inquire about the regulations and teachings?\n\nThe Patriarch replied: The sages of antiquity, recognizing the difficulty of entering the study of the Dao and the ease with which the worldly desires lead one astray, established texts on ritual regulations, precepts, and models to unify external conduct. They provided methods for concentrating the mind and fixing the spirit to rectify the heart and restore it, and techniques for refining qi and the primordial embryo to regulate diet. They also included offerings for invoking the real and expressing gratitude to cleanse transgressions. Only then did they proceed with study.\n\nThose without learning reach the depths of ignorance, grasping at the repository of diminishing and further diminishing. When one aligns with non-action, the gates of deceit and cunning do not open, and the purity and harmony of tranquility can be attained. Thus, the scriptures speak of the Three Registers and Seven Grades.\n\nThe Three Registers are:\nFirst, the *Golden Register Retreat*, which eliminates celestial disasters and protects and stabilizes the kingdom—used only by emperors.\nSecond, the *Jade Register Retreat*, which delivers the people, requests blessings, and expresses repentance—used only by empresses, consorts, and officials.\nThird, the *Yellow Register Retreat*, which aids the living, delivers the dead, and rescues those suffering in the Nine Dark Prisons of the Earth—used by common scholars and the populace.\n\nThe Seven Grades are:\nFirst, the *Three Sovereigns Retreat*, for seeking immortality and protecting the state.\nSecond, the *Natural Retreat*, for cultivating the real and studying the Dao.\nThird, the *Highest Clarity Retreat*, for ascending to emptiness and entering the subtle.\nFourth, the *Instruction Retreat*, for averting disasters and healing illnesses.\nFifth, the *Mud and Ashes Retreat*, for repenting transgressions and requesting life.\nSixth, the *Illuminating the Real Retreat*, for delivering the souls of the Nine Dark Prisons.\nSeventh, the *Three Primes Retreat*, for repenting sins before the Three Officials.\n\nThese various retreats may last one day and one night, three days and three nights, or seven days and seven nights, all in accordance with the ritual models. In all cases, they have their basis.\n\nThus, when exiting *qian* and entering *xun*, there are incantations for both exit and entry. When visualizing spirits and concentrating on the real, there are methods for both visualization and concentration. Whether sounding the ritual drum, contemplating the circular image, or summoning the attending guards and envoys of communication, one must be clear about the direction from which they emerge. When invoking the Supreme Perfected’s life-generating qi, one must manifest the place into which it enters.\n\nThe Dao resides in the human heart, yet external petitions are still necessary. Since one cannot yet achieve profound union, one must make it manifest through action. The human heart has no form, yet when set in motion, it creates boundaries. When boundaries are purified, the heart becomes clear; when the heart is clear, conduct becomes pure; when conduct is pure, one can commune with the spirits; when the heart is clear, one can comprehend the Dao of Heaven. Therefore, ascending the altar to make vows, presenting yellow petitions, and submitting memorials ensure that both heart and form are fully expressed, allowing the human and the divine to unite.\n\nI have heard it said: \"Ten thousand scrolls of cinnabar script are not as good as guarding the One.\" I also say: Ten thousand regulations and teachings are not as good as guarding the One. If one knows how to guard the One, then one can trace the branches to investigate the root, and from the coarse enter the refined. Otherwise, merely adorning the exterior with clamorous and ornate displays is like child’s play—one only drifts further from the Dao! How then can one penetrate the real and comprehend the numinous?\n\nLin Boqian asked: What about the rituals of offering?\n\nThe Patriarch replied: In ancient times, the way of communing with the divine placed sincerity and reverence first. Later generations, lacking sufficient sincerity and reverence, prepared objects to serve as ritual implements. If one were truly sincere and could prepare the objects, it might still be acceptable. Yet when the objects are not even prepared, the disrespect is extreme!\n\nThe scriptures say: \"One may offer water and present flowers—what need is there for other things?\" The scriptures also say: \"Imitating worldly etiquette and dignity\"—thus, all the offerings of today are sufficient if they are without shame. Otherwise, they are all irreverent—how can one not be warned?\n\nThe *Dushi* says: According to the *Jade Standards and Heavenly Statutes*, when setting up an offering, one must not present paper money to the Highest Perfected—this is a grave act of disrespect. Though there were funerary objects in ancient times, there was no paper money. Only by the end of the Han dynasty did paper money appear, and it was used to sacrifice to the ghosts and spirits of the middle and lower realms. How can it be used to offer to the Celestial Perfected?\n\nThose in the world who are greedy for profit, even when their bodies have passed through the Great Yin, retain a single念. As the *Ten Thousand Lights Repentance* says: \"What is lacking or deficient are all worldly treasures.\" Thus, the burning of paper money is meant to break this念.\n\nIt is further said: Among the regulations and teachings, there is a section on lighting lamps, which states that the Dipper revolves in the center of Heaven, truly governing the fortunes and misfortunes of humanity, and holding the power over life and death. Therefore, one must urgently submit a petition—there is none who does not respond.",

      "translated_text": "Should one have the means to conduct a jiao offering, one ought to follow the rites of the Esoteric Jiao or the Hetu Jiao, supplicating according to one’s heartfelt prayers. Yet today, there are those who light lamps for the birthdays of temple deities, or who vow to light lamps due to illness—truly unaware of the profound efficacy of lighting lamps.\n\nThe Patriarch said: In this world, all transmit the name of the \"Dong An,\" yet none know the reason for its name. According to ancient regulations, the altar was adorned with vermilion and bore the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures, hence called the *Dong An*. All memorials and petitions were presented before it. Now, however, it is otherwise: merely a table is set, unadorned with vermilion—this may still pass; and precious offerings of texts are placed upon it—this, too, may pass. Yet worse, miscellaneous objects are heaped upon it, some taken from it to offer incense, others to recite invocations, all under the pretext of bringing them closer to the imperial presence. Yet Heaven hears from on high, and no voice is too distant to reach it. If one claims proximity to the imperial presence ensures reception, then are all other petitions truly unheard? How can one not know that the vastness of the void is filled with spirits, and that a single thought, once arisen, is known throughout the Three Realms—what distinction is there between far and near, high and low?\n\nIt is further said: At the beginning of the jiao rites, the rite of *chi shui* (commanding water) is performed to dispel impurities. Later generations, clinging to tradition without change, perform this purification only after three or nine days, at the start of the jiao. If so, then during those three or nine days, impurities remain undispelled—how can one then approach the Perfected? If one argues that once the images are arranged, no defilement remains, why then use *chi shui* at the start of the jiao? In my view, *chi shui* should be performed at the very beginning of all rites. When the environment is purified, the mind becomes clear; when the mind is clear, conduct is pure; when conduct is pure, one may commune with the spirits; and when the mind is clear, one may align with the Dao of Heaven. After commanding the water, one proceeds in order: offering incense, inviting the masters, and approaching the Perfected.\n\nZihu Xie Xiandao asked: What is the essential principle of *gang bu* (the Pace of Yu)?\n\nThe Preceptor replied: I have heard from my master that, in general, *gang bu* is mostly based on the five-step system of mutual generation and restriction, stepping like a cat or dog crouching like a snake. Advance five steps, retreat five steps; advance seven, retreat seven. The four directions follow the numbers of the Five Phases’ generation and completion. Only after assuming the serpent’s crouch may one strike. Observe how one stalks a mouse—it is the same. Thus it is said: \"The shaman’s step is Yu’s step; Yu’s step is but five, yet it harmonizes the Five Phases, and with long practice, one ascends.\" Such is the case with the methods of the Eight Gates of Dunjia, Taiyi Liuren, and Gu Xu—all fundamentally rely on the manifestation of the step.\n\nNowadays, people tread upon the *kui* and tread upon the Dipper, yet how many know the great prohibitions that remain? As the scriptures say: \"If you wish to ascend to the Perfected, do not offend the Perfected One.\" The Perfected One is the third star. It is also said: \"If you wish to summon the spirits, do not block the Gate of Heaven.\" The Gate of Heaven is the Wenqu Star.",

      "translated_text": "In all methods of stepping the Dipper, one must strictly avoid violating the celestial principles or transgressing the stellar regulations. If the feet cross horizontally, this is called \"violating the celestial principles\"; if the feet advance mistakenly, this is called \"transgressing the stellar regulations.\" Should such violations occur, one must immediately bow at the head of the star and offer an apology—thus may it be resolved.\n\nZiju Zhao Mufu asked: \"What is meant by the so-called Yin Dipper and Yang Dipper today?\"\nMaster Du replied: \"I received this teaching from my master: after the Winter Solstice, beginning from *Kui* is the Yang Dipper; after the Summer Solstice, beginning from *Qiao* is the Yin Dipper. Stepping the Yang Dipper first, then the Yin Dipper, is called 'Fire and Water Uncrossed'; stepping the Yin Dipper first, then the Yang Dipper, is called 'Water and Fire Crossed.' Nowadays, people consider starting with the left foot at the initial star and reciting from *Kui* to *Qiao* as the Yang Dipper, while starting with the right foot at the initial star and reciting from *Tan* to *Po* as the Yin Dipper. How mistaken! This is a baseless theory. The *Scripture of Flying Spirits to Visit the Dipper* states: 'Following the sequence is Yang; reversing it is Yin. From *Kui* to *Qiao* is following; from *Qiao* to *Kui* is reversing.' The essential point is simply this: 'If you wish to fly your spirit, do not offend the Perfected One, the third star.' All else is merely the *ding* step.\"\n\nBoqian asked: \"There are said to be five *La* days—what are they?\"\nThe Patriarch replied: \"The first day of the first month is Heavenly *La*, when the Five Emperors convene the Nine *Qi* in the Azure Heaven of the East—this is the day when the Primordial Spirit of the Heavenly Penetrating Capital opens the Yuan at the Supreme August Palace. The fifth day of the fifth month is Earthly *La*, when the Five Emperors convene the Three *Qi* in the Cinnabar Heaven of the South—this is the day when the Great Spirit of Swift Fire and Commanding Decree enters the Jade Clarity Palace of Divine Radiance. The seventh day of the seventh month is the *La* of Virtue and the Dao, when the Five Emperors convene the Seven *Qi* in the White Heaven of the West—this is the day when the Vice Marshal of Heavenly Strategy opens the Yuan to illuminate the Void Palace of Lingxu. The first day of the tenth month is the *La* of the People’s Year, when the Five Emperors convene the Five *Qi* in the Mysterious Heaven of the North—this is the day when the Great Marshal of Assisting Sagacity opens the Yuan at the Scarlet Heavenly Palace of Jingdan. The *La* day in the twelfth month is the *La* of Kings and Lords, when the Five Emperors convene the Myriad *Qi* in the Jade Capital of the Upper Realm of Xuandu—this is the day when the Great Marshal of the Dark Warrior opens the Yuan at the Harmonious Migration and Correction Palace. These five days are when the Five Emperors gather and the five spirits first open their palaces—thus they are called the Five *La*.\"\n\nThe Patriarch continued: \"You have long heard of these ancient teachings.

Tao Hongjing of the Jin dynasty now oversees the Water Bureau of Penglai as its Inspector. Chu Suiliang of the Tang is now a Messenger of the Five Thunders. Yan Zhenqing now serves as Left Judge of the North Polar Expulsion-of-Evil Court, while Li Yangbing is its Right Judge. Li Bai is now the Pure and Leisurely Perfected of the Eastern Florescence Upper Clarity Bureau. Bai Letian is now the Long-lived Immortal Master of Penglai.\n\nAmong the female immortals, Wei Huacun of the Jin is now the Purple Void Primordial Lady, ranking among the Immortal Lords. Xie Ziran of the Tang is now the Perfected of the Eastern Ultimate. What manner of persons were these? How can one fail to emulate them?\n\nThe text further states: According to the *Divine Empyrean Jade Register*, one is called a \"Primordial Destiny Perfected\" when practicing the Orthodox Unity Dao, thereby refining one’s own primordial destiny to attain its truth. How can the common and vulgar take \"Perfected\" as an official title, brazenly misusing it—even to the point of submitting it in memorials? One must examine oneself and reflect: does one’s cultivation truly embody the conduct of a Perfected? If one lacks such conduct yet presumptuously adopts the title, the sin extends to nine generations, and Heaven’s pardon does not apply. One may only be called \"Recipient of Such-and-Such Dharma Transmission,\" with lower ranks termed \"Dharma Titles.\" Those without transmission titles are considered lay disciples upon ordination.\n\nXiandao asked: \"Recently, I have heard of the *Yuantong* Dharma and have privately doubted it. Its talismanic seal is round on the outside and square within, with the Five Phases at its center and the Eight Trigrams surrounding it. The provincial and prefectural bureaus are arrayed at the four directions, taking the four characters *Lingbao Yuantong* as its宗 and *Hunhua Xuanmi* as its root. It cobbles together various talismans, diagrams, incantations, and mudras into a single system, calling itself the *Great Yuantong Dharma*. Does the Perfected Master approve of this?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"The spirit has no fixed form, hence it is called *yuan* (round); *qi* has no fixed substance, hence it is called *tong* (penetrating). The ancient teaching of *yuantong* refers to the blending of spirit and *qi*, emerging and entering the formless, returning to primordial chaos. If one now reduces it to shapes, instruments, trigrams, and numbers, how far removed is this from the true *yuantong*?\"\n\nThe Patriarch said: \"The Celestial Master of Han once declared: 'If one can purify the six senses and still the square inch of the heart, practicing this over time, one may sit and command ghosts and spirits, summoning wind and rain.' Yet today’s students of the Dharma do not root themselves in the Dao or trace their lineage to the heart. Each becomes his own master, each household its own school. They regard spirit-attachment as marvelous and dream-visions as sublime. The officers they summon number in the hundreds and thousands, while the Dharma ranks they confer include 'Perfected' and 'Envoys.' Some mix shamanic techniques with orthodox methods; others claim secret transmissions from spirit-writing. When questioned, they reply that it accords with the statutes; when challenged, they insist it is true transmission. Alas! The errors of false masters are not the fault of sentient beings—one blind man leads the blind, delusion begets delusion. How lamentable!\"\n\nDushi, discussing the matter of talismanic water with Zishu, remarked: \"Those who seek it are not always devout; some merely test it. Even so, I test them in return by granting their request, yet it often proves ineffective.\"\n\nThe Patriarch, upon hearing this, said: \"One must not respond to their pretense with sincerity. Whether it proves efficacious or not is another matter.\"\n\nThe Patriarch further declared: \"Do not ask whether it is numinous or not, whether it is efficacious or not. Simply act as the hand moves, without entertaining any thoughts.\"\n\nDushi said to Boqian: \"Your Patriarch presided over the Azure Mushroom Retreat; I now oversee the Crane Forest Retreat; you currently govern the Purple Radiance Retreat. In general, those who uphold the Dharma must establish a site for incense offerings and petition for the name of a retreat. Such was the case with the Celestial Master of Han’s Twenty-Four Treaties, the ancient Thirty-Six Retreat Huts, and Xu Jingyang’s Seven Retreats. The statutes of retreats and treaties state: 'For lay households, it is called a *jing* (retreat); for masters, it is called a *zhi* (treaty).'\"\n\nThe Patriarch said: \"The establishment of altars and the holding of jiao rites are, in essence, one and the same. When discussing this, one might say: 'On such a day, Heaven is free of floating dust, the Four *Qi* shine clearly, rivers and seas are still, mountains and peaks swallow mist, the sun and moon cease their motion, the celestial pivot halts its wheel. Above and below are opened and connected, the Two Modes harmoniously interact.' At such a time, the hundred spirits and host of Perfecteds gather in hidden communion. Thus, during the jiao rites, this is the ideal state. Yet when presenting memorials and invoking the Perfecteds, even if the weather is not so perfect, resonance may still occur. If the purpose is to deliver the deceased and ferry souls, it may require overcast and rain. If the aim is to dispel calamities and avert misfortune, it may require clear skies. All jiao rites are conducted accordingly.\"\n\nDushi said to Xiandao: \"I once heard from my master: 'Laozi has Three Treasures: first, compassion; second, frugality; third, not daring to put oneself first in the world.' Xu Jingyang has Eight Treasures: loyalty, filial piety, integrity, prudence, magnanimity, tolerance, and forbearance. Lü Dongbin has Four Treasures: first, no recklessness; second, no greed; third, utmost sincerity; fourth, holding to the One. Chen Niewan has Five Treasures: first, wisdom; second, trustworthiness; third, benevolence; fourth, courage; fifth, solemnity. To adapt to circumstances with many changes, leaving others unable to fathom one’s intentions, is called wisdom. To focus the mind and hold steadfastly to the One without wavering is called trustworthiness. To aid others and benefit things, always acting with leniency and forgiveness, is called benevolence. To act decisively and maintain a resolute heart is called courage. To refrain from frivolous speech, carrying oneself with gravity and restraint, is called solemnity.\n\nThe Eastern Barbarian Thunder is benevolent, capable of wind and rain, nurturing the myriad things. The Southern Barbarian Thunder is courageous, clarifying commands, rewarding good and punishing evil. The Western Barbarian Thunder is solemn, restraining primordial *qi* and striking with thunder to rouse all beings. The Northern Barbarian Thunder is wise, lying hidden in the Kan position, rising when the time is right. The Central Barbarian Thunder is trustworthy, lying dormant through the four seasons, never issuing commands recklessly.\"",

It is not that the objects differ in size, but rather that the mind harbors emptiness or fullness.\n\nWhen a fierce tiger strides, the grasses and trees lie flat; when a venomous snake rages, the earth and stones are overturned. This is because when the spirit is whole, its power is great, and when essence is complete, its *qi* is mighty.\n\nThe archer who resembles a tiger sees only the tiger and not the stone; the one who slays the violent flood-dragon sees only the dragon and not the water. At such moments, the eyes see what they should not see, and the ears hear what they should not hear—this is the way of employing spirit through form.\n\nWhen the mind does not doubt the hand, and the hand does not doubt the brush, only after forgetting both hand and brush does one grasp the way of calligraphy.\n\nTo sweep away filth, one must summon the *qi* of the Five Emperors; to subdue vipers, one must command the essence of the Five Stars. If the summoned and commanded do not arrive, how can one accomplish anything?\n\nSpirit is like a mother, and *qi* is like a child. To summon *qi* with spirit is to summon a child with its mother—how could it dare not come?\n\nMaster Du said: There was once a poem by a high monk:\n*A pond of lotus leaves, endless as robes,*\n*A few pines with yellow needles, food in abundance.*\n*Just as the world learns of my dwelling,*\n*This mountain monk moves his abode again.*\n\nLater, a cultivator of immortality also composed a quatrain:\n*When hungry, I dine on the saliva beneath my tongue and am full;*\n*When cold, the fire from my cinnabar field warms me.*\n*I carry with me a poor man’s livelihood—*\n*Better to seek within myself than to seek from others.*\n\nThese two poems may serve to slightly purify the turbid schemes of body and speech.\n\nThe Patriarch said: The cultivator of the real establishes resolve with sincerity, conducts affairs with bitter perseverance, penetrates insight with concentrated thought, and forgets the self to merge with the true.\n\nIf one can do this, the scripture says: *The cosmos is in your hands, the myriad transformations are within your body.* It also says: *If a person can always remain pure and still, heaven and earth will all return to them.*\n\nThe world may not understand this, but if one can attain stillness amid clamor, clarity amid turbidity, view all with equanimity, and sever all thoughts—moving without obstruction, obtaining the great elixir of peace—this is called the Dao.\n\nIf not, gazing at the stars and worshipping the Dipper may suffice; reciting scriptures and chanting incantations may also suffice. I know not which is better!\n\nHe also said: I have heard from my former master that the ancient immortals and sagely worthies transmitted teachings mouth-to-mouth, without relying on written words. Now, in this world, I record them in writing. Those who awaken may transmit the sagely way; without awakening, there is no attainment—those who awaken attain for themselves.\n\nTo attain the sagely way is to be without past or present. Its departure is not of the past, its arrival is not of the present. What can be transmitted is called the affair, not the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally untransmittable; the Dao has no sound or color, no form or appearance, no past or present, no coming or going.\n\nHe also said: Performing rituals is like serving as an official; cultivating the Dao is like living in seclusion.\n\nAnother day, a guest asked about the Twelve Divine Officials, and so an explanation was provided:\n\nThe Celestial Stem of *Tiangang* belongs to *chen* (辰). *Chen*, *xu* (戌), *chou* (丑), and *wei* (未) are called the Four Uprights, as they belong to earth and reside in the center, hence the name Four Uprights. The character *gang* (罡) is composed of *si* (四, four) and *zheng* (正, upright), and since *chen* is earth, this divine official is called *Tiangang*.\n\n*Taiyi* belongs to *si* (巳). *Si* is the Gate of Thunder, also called the Gate of Wind. The Water Mouth is also the position of the Nine Heavens’ *Taiyi* Ten Spirits, hence this divine official is called *Taiyi*.\n\n*Shenguang* belongs to *wu* (午). *Wu* is the brilliance of *li* (離), not originally *Shenguang* but *Tengguang* (腾光, soaring light).\n\n*Xiaoji* belongs to *wei* (未), and *Daji* belongs to *chou* (丑), both noble spirits of heaven. *Jia* (甲), *wu* (戊), and *geng* (庚) are the Three Celestial Marvels, and since oxen and sheep are esteemed, *Daji* and *Xiaoji* are both auspicious spirits.\n\n*Chuansong* belongs to *shen* (申). *Shen* is *kun* (坤), and *kun* is the Earth Gate. The Earth Gate is clouds, which gather clouds above in the heavens, hence the name *Chuansong* (传送, transmitting messages).\n\n*Congkui* belongs to *you* (酉). The *cong* (从) is pronounced in the falling tone, meaning \"to follow.\" It is so named because it resides beside *xu* (戌) and *kui* (魁), hence *Congkui* (从魁, following *Kui*).\n\n*Hekui* belongs to *xu* (戌). *Xu* and *hai* (亥) are the source of the Milky Way, and *xu* is the Celestial River, hence this spirit is named *Hekui* (河魁, River Chief).\n\n*Dengming* belongs to *hai* (亥). *Hai* is the Heavenly Gate.\n\n*Shenhou* belongs to *zi* (子). *Zi* belongs to *kan* (坎), and *kan* is the Yin Queen, the Heavenly Queen, hence *Shenhou* (神后, Divine Queen).\n\n*Yin* (寅) is *Gongcao*. *Yin* is *gen* (艮), and *kun* (坤) and *gen* are both earth. *Gen* is the mountain, *kun* is the earth, and as mountains and marshes communicate *qi*, *gen* and *kun* gather clouds. Thus, *yin* and *shen* (申) are the divine officials of *Gongcao* (功曹) and *Chuansong* (传送).\n\n*Dachong* belongs to *mao* (卯). *Mao* is thunder, and the thunder spirit is called *Tianchong* (天冲, Celestial Thrust).

man of Huanglong.\nIn Taiping Temple, he once left a poem—\nthree visits to Yueyang, who knows?\nAt dusk, he brushed his sleeves and left Wuyi;\nat midnight, he played with the moon on Junshan.\nDrunk, he sang wildly, dancing as he sang—\na game of evening chess, how many ages now?\nOn Yellow Crane Tower, in clear wind and bright moon;\non Peng River’s shore, among white duckweed and red reeds.\nThat year, after drinking a single dose,\nwho would believe a child was nurtured in nothingness?\nThe Eighteen Methods of the Perfect Art remain,\nyet he would not lightly speak them to others.\nThrice he sighed at failing the examinations,\ndeclaring his father was Lü the Remonstrator.\nIn his bag, auspicious herbs—no silver for medicine.\nBeyond the heavens, he wandered, riding the sword’s qi.\nThe master’s sword technique was untransmitted,\na thousand changes, ten thousand transformations, ever sudden.\nHeaven sent him to save living beings,\nfor in the fourth month, Pure Yang’s hexagram belongs to Qian.\nTaking the Kan trigram’s line to fill Li’s belly,\nit becomes pure Qian, yang qi fulfilled.\nThus he could ride qi and transform into a flying dragon,\nwherever he went, delivering people, leaving wondrous traces.*\n\nThis assembly in Pingjiang differs from others—\nthis year, especially, is unlike the past.\nIn former years, when the gathering was held,\nclouds parted and cranes soared in the sky.\nNow, a rustic ascends this seat—\nI must begin by breaking it open from the start.\nYou must grasp the heart of Pure Yang\nbefore you can learn the Dao of Pure Yang.\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken—how to learn it?\nScooping earth for incense is not yet the truth.\nOnly a true knower like Zhang Tianjue understands.\n\n**Minor Address at the Eastern Tower**\nRecorded by the disciple Zijuzi Zhao Jiang\n\nThe Supreme Dao resides in the heart—\nthe heart itself is the Dao.\nWithin and beyond the six senses,\nthe same wind and light prevail.\nIf inner things shift,\naging and death will come.\nSilent circulation of primordial harmony—\nthis is how to attain longevity.\n\nThus the body takes the heart as its lord;\nthe heart is the abode of spirit.\nWhen the heart is at peace, the spirit is numinous;\nwhen the heart is wild, the spirit is mad.\nEmpty the heart, and true qi congeals;\ncalm the heart, and yang harmony gathers.\nBlood and qi unobstructed, naturally flowing;\nwill and intent at ease, the myriad disturbances cease.\n\nWhen the heart grieves, yin qi congeals;\nwhen the heart rejoices, yang qi scatters.\nThoughts arise, and the spirit flees;\nthoughts cease, and the spirit rests.\n\nIn this human body,\nthe heart’s spirit\nemerges through the eyes to see—\nseeing long, the heart’s spirit departs,\nnot lost to greed but to exhaustion.\nThe kidneys’ essence emerges through the ears to hear—\nhearing long, the kidneys’ essence withers,\nnot ruined by lust but by depletion.\nThe liver’s hun emerges through the nose to smell—\nsmelling long, the liver’s hun scatters,\nnot harmed by anger but by dissipation.\nThe gallbladder’s po emerges through the mouth to speak—\nspeaking long, the gallbladder’s po dies,\nnot destroyed by impatience but by exhaustion.\n\nThe essentials of the Supreme Dao:\nUtmost stillness to congeal the spirit,\nprofound reflection to penetrate perception,\nfasting and abstinence to respond to the true,\ncompassion and kindness to complete merit,\nhumility and gentleness to preserve sincerity.\n\nLet the heart be free of杂念,\nthe intent not stray outward.\nLet the heart constantly return to unity,\nthe intent naturally thus.\nWith the heart serene,\nthe four great elements are at ease.\n\nIf the heart is not in the ears, what makes sound?\nIf the heart is not in the eyes, what makes color?\nIf the heart is not in the nose, what makes fragrance?\nIf the heart is not in the mouth, what makes speech?\n\nQi gathers, and one is full;\nspirit harmonizes, and one is warm.\nThus the heart of the Dao is the master of qi,\nqi is the root of form,\nform is the dwelling of qi,\nand spirit is the tool of form.",

and replenish in tranquil harmony.\n\nWithin the twelve hours, only one moment suffices—\nNine returns, seven reversions, these small matters.\nNurture with care, ever sealing tightly;\nThe *xun*-wind must ceaselessly blow into *kan*.\nWhether walking, sitting, sleeping, or eating, remain thus,\nEver fearful the fire may cool, the elixir’s power delayed.\n\nA year’s celestial cycle excludes *mao* and *you*;\nNine revolutions’ work is daily ninefold.\nWhen the tenth month arrives, jade frost descends,\nThe sacred embryo rounds, wind and thunder roar.\n\nA year’s gestation births one child,\nWho begets grandchildren, branching endlessly.\nIn its myriad transformations lies the subtlest art—\nHow could this be lightly taught to others?\n\nForget form, still the heart, sever self and other;\nIn life and death, motion and stillness, distinguish guest from host.\nAt dawn and dusk, medicines rise and sink;\nWater and fire, hexagrams and talismans must be scrutinized.\nTrue *qi* steams without cold or heat,\nPure yang overflows, beyond birth and death.\n\nThere is a path where mother and child part the embryo—\nIts wonder lies in *wei*, *ji*, *dou*, *niu*, and *nü*.\nShould you wish to prolong life and rescue the aged and infirm,\nSever lust and practice side doors no more.\n\nIf you would preserve form and dwell forever in the world,\nNone but stoking the fire to refine the divine elixir suffices.\nThe divine elixir’s work takes three hundred days—\nSeven dissolutions, seven moltings, and the Great Return is complete.\nGathered, it forms shape; scattered, it becomes *qi*—\nHeaven and earth, all are the same.\n\nBetter to seek a master’s peaceful method\nThan to lewdly plunder essence and blood.\nAs the ancients said: “Heaven and earth all return”—\nLearn the art of non-action and purity.\nBind the thousand-acre clouds of green mountains,\nScoop the single moon from the azure pool.\n\nThe Mysterious Pass’s aperture—none know it,\nYet this is the *daogui*, most wondrous and rare.\nOne night, I encountered Master Lü,\nWho held an elixir formula still more marvelous!\nTake the Great Void as crucible and furnace,\nSeize the crow and hare as medicinal materials.\nLet mountains, rivers, and the vast earth blaze with fierce fire—\nWithin, the ten thousand images birth wind and thunder.\n\nOnce chaos, now the myriad things,\nAll at once conjoin to form the sacred embryo.\nNo gold or wood to question or divide,\nNo dragon or tiger to separate north and south.\nNeither mother nor child, nor female nor male,\nNeither husband nor wife, nor black nor white—\nWho names this the Great Return Elixir?\nEven the Most High Lord Lao could not swallow it.\n\nLord Lao left it for the carefree wanderer,\nWho, having ingested it, soars as spirit to the Great Ultimate.\nThen take a cup of primordial wine,\nAnd with this *daogui* fortify your countenance.\nThough seas may turn to mulberry fields,\nIn my Dao, the pot’s year has not yet passed.\n\nIf only your heart were firm as iron,\nI would secretly transmit it word by word.\nThe subtlety lies in but half a phrase—\nThe immortals’ dharma is truly natural.\nHasten to begin, knit the embryonic immortal,\nAnd chanting brightly, return to Penglai’s heaven.\n\n**Haiqiong Jun’s “All Methods Return to One” Song**\n\nThe great medicine of the golden elixir is wondrous beyond measure,\nA single speck of elixir’s head glows red within and without.\nTrue mercury, true lead—once grasped,\nIn an instant the tiger is subdued, the dragon captured alive.\n\nThe Yellow Matchmaker weds them in Ding Gong’s abode,\nAt *xun*’s position, the nine revolutions’ work is blown to completion.\nAfter ten months, the embryo rounds beyond *li* and *kan*,\nPurple clouds ascend from the empty jade crucible.\n\nIn short hemp robes and headscarves, they throng the bustling market,\nSeeking herbs, burning thatch, tending the medicine chest.\nTheir own three yellows and four spirits—\nWho knows the intent behind installing the furnace and refining the crucible?\n\nPaper jackets and hempen garments hide in the mountains,\nEating pine, drinking water, enduring hunger and cold.\nSun’s essence, moon’s marrow—empty breaths,\nOnly in the end does one know the Way’s difficulty.\n\nIn the ghostly caverns beneath Black Mountain,\nBacks bent, heads drooping, mouths drooling,\nDreaming of dreamers within dreams—\nWhen will they await cinnabar’s death?\n\nThe foolish, ill-fated fail to sever lust,\nClosing the tailbone to plunder another’s yin.\nOriginal essence shakes without walls,\nMistaking yellow mud for gold.\n\nRong Cheng’s three peaks teach the art of riding women,\nPlundering essence to feed the eyes and breasts.\nThe Great Dao’s true fire has no yin or yang—\nToil in form and attachment is but vain suffering.\n\nKnocking teeth, swallowing saliva, gulping *qi* with sound,\nThe cart’s wheels turn in vain, the skull’s form moves.\nFalsely taking mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female,\nThey boast of golden crystals filling the elbow’s hollow.\n\nHolding breath at the nose’s tip, drawing empty cakes,\nHow many escape their shadows at noon?\nGuest winds and perverse *qi* rumble in the belly—\nHow could divine cinnabar long abide in the crucible?\n\nStudying Zen, perceiving nature, realizing suchness—\nDo not claim emptiness suffices without the heart.\nAwakened yet not practicing the wisdom of *qian*,\nA thousand cliffs and ten thousand ravines must still be traversed.\n\nHow many aged Confucians study the *Zhouyi*,\nYet know not the Great Ultimate returns to the Non-Ultimate?\nForgetting form, they would follow natural truth,\nBut fear spring’s departure leaves the grass powerless.\n\nThe Ming Sect’s sole task is demon-quelling—\nWhat of the seven-hour merits?\nUnknowing the bright intent of purity today,\nTheir faces sallow, their toil in vain.\n\nHu’s Yangshan, a single patriarch,\nHis nine returns’ adornments all empty words.\nWielding golden rings, driving three chariots—\nWho has ever flown to the Golden Heaven?\n\nMore are the four-fruit vegetarians,\nAt the Nine Bends’ riverbank casting iron talismans.\nThough they burn all their frankincense,\nHow can they become buddhas when essence and blood, original yang, are parched?\n\nThirty-six hundred guardians of side doors,\nOpening crowns, shrinking turtles, practicing breath-holding,\nVisualizing the cinnabar field, refining the five sprouts,\nExhaling the old, inhaling the new—wasted effort.\n\nWorshiping pagodas, burning incense, chanting sutras,\nEven bowing to the Dipper and gazing at stars,\nSwallowing talismans, drinking water, reciting spells—\nHow could laziness ever attain the Dao?\n\nVisualizing, massaging, the Eight Brocades,\nLaughing and exhaling the Six Words to constrain waking and sleeping,\nIf you wish to return essence to replenish the brain,\nNone but a cup of rich wine suffices.\n\nEyes straining to direct *qi* to the crown,\nPlayfully speaking of sun and moon illuminating Kunlun.\nWhen they glimpse a halo’s appearance,\nThey point to Heavenly Worthies and World-Honored Ones.\n\nEyes have no light—human delusion;\nEars have no sound—how could they hear?\nAbove lies the Great Abyss, below the Misty Pool,\nFalsely pointing to the Central Yellow, enduring hunger.\n\nVainly tracing celestial cycles, practicing hexagrams—\nWhen have they ever known the true dragon and tiger?\nThose who painfully know the true dragon and tiger\nHave grasped the upward path.\n\nSecretly clutching their bowls to drink urine,\nSpitting and swallowing saliva to form pearls,\nNose dripping two streams of snot—\nDare they call themselves Jade Stem Immortals?",

without,\nA hundred years but a wandering ghost of yin and spirit.\n\nHeaven’s Gate wolfberries and yellow essence,\nBeans, apricots, ginger, pepper, ginseng, and licorice—\nHave they ever truly become earthbound immortals?\nSkin scorched, flesh rotted—pitiful creatures.\n\nFasting rites, purifications, proclamations, and Sanskrit chants,\nDividing talismans, breaking contracts, transmitting scriptures—\nUnknowing of the two true words of Heaven’s Heart,\nThey only master the Three Lights’ talisman-water,\nBrandishing thunder seals in their sleeves to frighten mountain spirits,\nWielding willow branches to mimic invisibility.\nThis heart is originally the treasury of communion with spirits,\nYet one errant thought spawns ten thousand illusions.\nThis body and all beyond it are hidden things,\nThis heart and all beyond it are sorcery.\n\nWithin the body lies the true heart, within the heart lies the body,\nNeither emerging from within nor without.\nAs for this Golden Liquor and Great Return Elixir,\nFrom the Original Valley to the Muddy Pellet,\nThe sevenfold refinement and replenishment are no great matter—\nPlants and trees, devoid of intent, mirror heaven and earth’s leisure.\n\nTrue roots, true stems bear true nectar,\nTrue crucibles, true altars, true alchemical furnaces.\nFrom the yang day they begin, on the yin day they accumulate,\nClearly distinguishing yang fire and yin talismans.\nHalf an acre of cinnabar field sown with golden millet,\nA single fragrant lingzhi blossom, rich and lush.\n\nThe iron ox roars into the cotton chamber,\nThe wooden horse gallops, leaping into the golden house.\nQian and Kun’s two eights congeal cinnabar,\nThe crucible brimming with melting white snowflakes.\nSeizing the tortoise and serpent in both hands,\nThe jade hare on the mountain peak transforms into a golden crow.\n\nThe oral formula for the Returned Elixir is known to few,\nMercury dragon and lead tiger depend on the fire’s timing.\nWithin three thousand moments, the infant takes form,\nTempered and nurtured without flaw.\nThe body becomes pure as a single piece of jade,\nThe cold toad’s light illumines the jade flask’s ice.\n\nAt midnight, thunder roars at the fontanel,\nA gust of pure wind in the marketplace startles gods and ghosts.\nIf celestial beings ask for the true esoteric formula,\nWho would dare leak Heaven’s secrets?\nOnly a hero of great resolve,\nWith a heart utterly empty,\nAt the first stirring of yang, the Great Elixir is complete—\nIn an instant, the adept becomes one with the numinous workings of creation.\nYet I fear my name may be recorded in the Southern Palace’s register,\nDrunk, riding a white crane to ascend to the Supreme Clarity.\n\n**Admonition on the Dao (also called \"Inscription for Broad Daylight\")**\n\nAlas!\nThe human body is like a rootless tree,\nRelying solely on breath as its trunk and branches.\nA hundred years of time\nAre like a dream.\nThe outgoing breath does not guarantee the incoming,\nThis morning does not guarantee the next.\nWasting the years,\nSuddenly old and dead,\nThe hundred bones dissolve,\nThe four elements disperse.\nThe spirit, confused and lost,\nScatters into the various destinies—\nWho knows what form the next life will take?\nThe wheel of birth and death turns endlessly,\nDeluded, failing to awaken,\nLazy, failing to strive.\nNow that you have arrived at this treasure mountain,\nDo not leave empty-handed.\nTo grow old and die as before,\nHaving come to the world in vain—\nEach must exert utmost effort,\nDevote yourself to the work as if your life depends on it.\nAs the ancients said:\n\"A year or two of toil,\nA thousand or ten thousand kalpas of bliss.\"\nFrom now on, gather your resolve,\nSingle-minded, without distraction.\nEyes, do not gaze outward;\nEars, do not listen outward.\nModerate your diet,\nReduce your sleep,\nCease idle chatter,\nStill your thoughts.\nCover your head with straw,\nSeek no comfort;\nCook rice to stave off hunger,\nDisregard minor hardships.\nLike the cicada drinking dew,\nYour body will become light and pure;\nLike the tortoise absorbing sunlight,\nYour lifespan will extend.\nIf you can dine on pine and cypress,\nWear a bamboo hat and straw cloak,\nSleep beneath clouds in the cliffs,\nDrink from streams before caves—\nYou are a true cultivator.\nIf you lack such strength,\nAt least gradually emulate the ancient worthies.\nTo practice otherwise\nIs to lack this fortune.\n\nStrive morning and night,\nRefining and smelting hour by hour.\nLike a dragon nurturing its pearl,\nLike a hen brooding her eggs,\nThe fire’s continuity forges a single whole.\nWhen mother and child meet at last,\nIs it not joyous?\n\n**Verses on Transmitting the Dharma and Illuminating the Mind by Peng Helin**\n\nThe myriad dharmas arise from the heart,\nEach thought is itself dharma.\nSpeech and silence, movement and stillness—\nAll are governed by dharma.\nWithout doubt, this is the true heart;\nGuarding the One is the true dharma.\nGuard the One without doubt,\nAnd every dharma becomes a dharma of the heart.\n\nDharma is the servant of the heart,\nThe heart is the master of dharma.\nWithout doubt, the heart is upright;\nAn upright heart makes dharma efficacious.\nGuard the One, and the heart is focused;\nA focused heart makes dharma manifest.\nIt is not that dharma is inherently efficacious—\nIt is your heart that makes it so.\n\n**Memorial to the Yellow Register Office**\n\nYour subordinate, the youthful servant Bai [Name], who attained the Dao underground and upholds the dharma, respectfully memorializes:\n\nFrom my earliest existence, by the grace of the August Emperor and the King,\nThe sacred *qi* dwelled within me,\nAnd my spiritual root remained unobscured.\nKnowing of this matter in past lives,\nI cultivated in this life and now encounter it again.\nI have been entrusted with thunder talismans\nAnd have roughly grasped the teachings.\nYet I, your subordinate, know this:\nThe Most High Dao, the Compassionate Father and Sacred Mother,\nAnd the Lords of the Ten Directions,\nHave always shown mercy and forgiveness.\nThus, I have grown lazy and negligent,\nFailing to maintain incense and offerings all year.\nIn the immortal registers,\nIt is as if I did not exist.\nYet I dare to presumptuously submit this memorial,\nFor I have my reasons.\n\nThis body of mine—\nSkin, hair, bones, blood,\nTears, saliva, phlegm—\nCannot become true.\nBut I possess a single numinous heaven,\nThe original nature,\nThe spirit of the primordial mandate.\nBoundless and immeasurable,\nIt can ascend to the imperial and brahmic realms,\nStanding in attendance before the Jade Dawn.\nThough I am lazy and negligent,\nThe Imperial True One knows me.\nEven ghosts and spirits can do nothing about it!\n\nIn years past, I was awakened to this:\nAll those who have attained the Dao and uphold the dharma in the mortal world,\nWith their ranks and titles,\nAre merely false claims.\nIf they serve in the celestial bureaus,\nTheir positions are assigned differently.",

      "translated_text": "Now with this humble clod of earth and dust, Peng Xiang, I have expounded and established the Yellow Register for my father, and thus am commanded to submit this memorial. Since I cannot refuse, I humbly request that for a time, I be granted the title of *Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity Palace Thunder Command*, to command the Five Thunder Generals and lead the affairs of the Thunder Bureau’s spirits and deities. Acting as the *Attendant Envoy of Supreme Clarity and the Yellow Register*, I shall resign this post once the ritual feast concludes. Should I be called to dispatch wind and thunder or distinguish between humans and ghosts, I ask only to borrow the thunderous title from above to address myself. When the day comes for my worldly obligations to be fulfilled and I present myself at court, I shall await further decree from the celestial offices. A myriad deaths would not suffice to atone for my presumption in daring to offend Your Celestial Majesty.\n\n**Memorial of Gratitude and Petition**\n*Submitted by the unworthy official [Name]*\n\nI respectfully submit this memorial on the twenty-third day of this month, presenting myself at the celestial gate to express gratitude and lay bare my heart.\n\nI reflect that nature is bestowed by Heaven, and whether one is wise or foolish, good or evil, is likewise ordained by Heaven. When humans and the Dao move in harmony, every action and stillness aligns with the Dao. Why then do dark realms establish courts of the netherworld, while the celestial powers institute bureaus of reward and punishment? The body and form arise from the cycles of qi, and fate is bound to the stars. Truly, life and death do not arise of themselves but seem to emerge from the interplay of yin and yang. The celestial mechanism never ceases, and the sentiments of beings readily shift—winter arrives, and ice naturally forms; spring comes, and grass turns green. All is shaped by qi, and thus the nature is established as its master. A thousand lamps illuminate a room with a single light, just as the vast sea contains countless waves. The distinction between the sentient and the insentient, and the difference between life’s allotment and its fulfillment, lie herein. Yet movement and stillness are not their original state; thoughts and desires manifest only after form takes shape. Once form is complete, the Dao resides within it. Those who attain it merge with the true, while those who lose it sink into confusion. Thus, the path of cultivating immortality and studying the Dao begins with establishing the gate of rectifying the mind and sincerity of intent. The Great Dao alone transcends life and death, and utmost sincerity can reverse the workings of creation. To preserve sincerity is to unite with the Dao, and all who attain the Dao possess sincerity. This is the path by which all beings enter, the realm where all sages have ascended.\n\nI, a being of impure flesh and defiled bones, a walking corpse of mere form, am endowed with vital qi and a nature that remains undimmed. My six senses are complete, and the three times are perfectly rounded. I can distinguish between beans and wheat, yet I dissolve distinctions of right and wrong, rising above the taint of honor and disgrace. In activity and stillness, stillness pervades all; in perceiving form and emptiness, emptiness encompasses all. I recognize that the six consciousnesses have no root, and the seven emotions are like dreams. I see how flesh and blood intoxicate the nature, and how form and substance stifle the spirit. Long have I hastened toward the mysterious pass, yet still I linger at the threshold of the Dao’s gate. Nature is trustworthiness, and the spirit communicates through it.\n\nI reverently consider the *Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity True King*, the *Great Emperor of Longevity*, the *Jade Sovereign*, the *Golden Portal True August One*, the *Jade Clarity Supreme Emperor*—whose heart contains the Great Brahma, whose hands grasp the Primordial Chaos, whose vastness defies naming, whose majesty is beyond reach. In compassion for all beings, You govern the multitude of perfected ones, bestowing grace upon the ten directions and surveying the myriad realms. I, a mere ant in form, dare to raise the voice of an earthworm, long bearing the weight of Your boundless favor, drenched in the nourishing rain of Your grace. Every prayer I have offered has been met with response. Fortunate to have heard the Dao a day sooner, I have cultivated the true amidst ten thousand kalpas. I now humbly recount the gradual progress of my practice and the beginnings of my realization.\n\nThough dull-witted, I secretly aspire to receive Your instruction, hoping that my lowly name might one day join the ranks of the ministers of the Empyrean. Presumptuously submitting this memorial, I dare to seek Your sagely attention. I confess my errors and beg for Your boundless mercy, that I may temporarily rouse the mind of revival and extinction to harmonize with the wondrous subtlety of emptiness. The methods of the Thunder Department I practice, the statutes of the Thunder Bureau I uphold—all serve to assist the upright, expel evil, aid the living, and deliver the dead. The officers and generals of the Three Bureaus are subject to my command, and the five divisions of wind and thunder answer to my summons. Should even the smallest merit or slightest good be recorded on the golden tablets, then this humble servant may one day reach the Jade Capital. Though the hemp grows straight when planted among reeds, and the fish thrives in water, without nurture it withers. Some say the crane is long and the heron short, yet there are snakes that shed their skins to become cicadas.\n\nI, in my foolishness, have dared to offend Your Celestial Majesty. With trepidation, I submit this memorial for Your consideration. I am filled with awe and reverence.",

My sworn brother, you aspire to immortality—not as one of the common crowd. Of late, you have come to understand the principle that the myriad methods return to the One, and you are no longer deceived by the various schools. This is the very focus of the sages and worthies of ancient times, rarely seen in recent ages. The Dao is not far—how could you fail to attain immortality?\n\nZhang Xiyu once said that there is a proper method for each stage, a secret method for each stage, a wondrous method for each stage, yet all methods ever reside in the heart—there is no other method. Though his words may seem careless, they are indeed well-founded.\n\nWhen first we met, we already spoke of the great elixir of golden cinnabar as our shared aspiration; only the timely conditions had not yet aligned. Now the moment has come, and our great trust requires no prior agreement. Recall our earlier verses in exchange, with lines such as “tiger-skin bamboo hat, Mount Taihua crown”—today, as a Dao official of Mount Taihua and the Cinnabar Scenery Bureau, I realize that those poems of old were already foreshadowing our present rendezvous.\n\nIn all matters, take care; in sacred matters, take care; in every matter, take care.

Though weary from travel, fortune favored a slight ease of body and spirit, and thoughts of old friends from the Three Mountains arose—lingering a while longer, I shall yet become a guest by the Zhang shores.\n\nThe vow made last spring shall not falter!\n\nFor now, I savor the Dao in solitude, content with incense, candles, and the attendants of the officials—nothing more than a single talisman and a draught of water, sufficient to dispel illness and repel malevolent influences. This is the true purpose of acting on Heaven’s behalf to transform the world. I have entrusted the preparation of medicinal pearls and ritual implements to Attendant Longevity of the Ministry, along with Immortal Longevity. Daily, I envision your refined and carefree bearing, regretting only that I could not visit the new hermitage east of the city for a cup of tea. This wish must be fulfilled.\n\nThose who study the Dao, beyond examining their faults and reflecting on their errors, should accept even minor setbacks with equanimity. Where the Dao resides, can worldly matters truly bring us joy or sorrow?\n\nThe waters of Penglai have grown shallow once more!\nThe mulberry fields lie level—turning back to gaze upon the old path.\n\nWritten in autumn at the Immortal Shedding Hut, the ding-chou year.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the third month in the wu-yin year, residing at the Temple of Supreme Peace and Prosperity in Jiangzhou, I write to send word to my worthy brother, the True Man of Crane Grove. Recently, I sent three letters—have they reached you? Of late, I trust your mastery of the Dao and its methods has advanced, your spiritual power surpassing what came before.\n\nHave the two talisman officials, Ju and Hao, been diligent in their duties? I wonder if the health of your household’s Attendant Longevity of the Ministry remains robust, and whether the Recluse of Medicinal Pearls and your heir, Chengfeng, are both well and at peace?\n\nThis spring, I traveled over two thousand li by water and land in search of a secluded retreat on Mount Lu. Fortunately, my four limbs feel light and unburdened, and all matters proceed smoothly. Yet on flower-bright mornings and moonlit evenings, with wine in hand and incense curling from the brazier, I often think of my southern friends with longing. And for old companions, my heart aches even more!\n\nThose who dwell beyond the world—whether mortal or sage—do not let honor or disgrace weigh on their minds, nor praise or blame occupy their thoughts. Only the spirits of trees and the demons of stones might discern what manner of person one truly is.\n\n*The Song of the Great Dao* and *The Chart of the Immortal Lineage* must surely be in wide circulation by now—how delightful! How delightful!",

Take care!\n\nRespectfully inscribed by this old man of Qiongshan, Bai, on the twentieth day of the tenth month.\n\nThis old man of Qiongshan, Bai, writes to Master Peng of the Crane Forest in Fuzhou. This spring, I arrived in Jiangzhou and proceeded to Xingguo Commandery, then passed through Yueyang, returned to Yuzhang, and stopped at Fuzhou before paying homage at Huagai Mountain. Descending to Linjiang Commandery, I took the route through Rao and Xin to prepare for my journey. On the first day of the eighth month, I presented myself at the imperial court, then traveled to Shaoxing, passed through Qingyuan Prefecture, and returned once more to Lin’an.\n\nOn the twentieth day of the tenth month, while wandering idly, I suddenly encountered Xiao Qian’an. From him, I learned that Liaoran has already passed away, Ruan has returned to Xiangshan, Zihu remains, and Dianxian is well. I have repeatedly received summons from Ningguo, but I no longer go to see them. Shi Kui now holds a key position in the Bureau of Military Affairs, and each has his own connections—one may call upon him if inclined. Yet my enthusiasm has waned, and all things now rest in tranquility. Each day, I do nothing but drink deeply, sing heartily, and bid farewell to the passing hours. I seek nothing more, nor do I ponder further.\n\nOnly for you, my Crane Forest—my beloved disciple, far away beyond two thousand *li*—I humbly pray that, even now, you attend upon the venerable Elder of the Ministry of Personnel, the immortal old master, and the young Daoist of the Pearl of Medicine, all of whom I trust are well. Qian’an could speak of one or two matters, which would bring me great comfort.\n\nHere, my wild and eccentric ways bring me joy, and others have grown accustomed to them. Only my uncle, the Recorder of the Realm, is greatly astonished by my unconventionality. The methods I now practice remain potent. Once, in a drunken stupor, I lost my footing and plunged into the waters of West Lake—my dharma-seal vanished entirely! Yet this too may provoke a hearty laugh.\n\nI had intended to journey to Tiantai, but before departing, I summoned Qian’an to instruct him. Gazing southward, my thoughts grow heavy with longing, and though I would write more, my brush falls silent.\n\nRespectfully bowing twice, I address this to my esteemed friend, the True Man of the Crane Forest. Since parting by the lakes and mountains of Yuan and Kai, time has slipped away. Suddenly, your letter arrived, bringing great comfort after our three autumns apart. I rejoice to learn that your campaigns have triumphed, and in your leisure, you cultivate and refine yourself. May the winds and thunder attend your command, and may your well-being flourish in every way. The Pearl of Medicine, attending to the scriptures, shares in this felicity.\n\nYou graciously sent me the *Classic of Purity* with your interlinear verses—each word aligns with the Dao, each phrase resonates with truth. Though you modestly asked for corrections, I find it already precise and flawless, with nothing to critique. Like a ceaseless spring, it flows day and night, reaching its perfect end!",

I further received the Supreme Clarity Talisman for Dispatching Ghosts and Spirits, the seal script of which has been submitted above—truly a means to govern and pacify the numinous.\n\nThe elder has since passed through Kanglu. If nothing has been seen or heard, do not send word, lest it drift or sink. By late autumn or early winter, we shall surely meet again. *The Jade Scripture of Thunder* should be printed by now; distribute ten copies to transmit among the scholars of Jiangxi. My heart brims with reverence. In the meantime, conduct yourself with the Dao and devote yourself to the Dharma, as befits the former veneration of the Celestial Officials.\n\nOn the fifth day of the first month, Yang Bozi sent a messenger bearing a carved box and two old-style quatrains, their sentiment and phrasing most respectful. I have transcribed them here; the rest need not be mentioned.\n\nSo-and-so bows in reply.\n\nTo Helin, Thunder Bureau Magistrate: Your medicinal pearls attend the scriptures, your solitary jade gleams between the hours.

At the initial handover, there appeared an enormous egg, most strange, larger than a peck measure. It remains there to this day, and thus the place is named Leizhou. Some say it was the afterbirth of Chen Luanfeng—how extraordinary! Yet what manner of being was Chen that he did not become the Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder General-in-Chief?\n\nNow we two are indeed no common men. My name is recorded in the register of Pengxi Terrace, my person ranks among the attendants of the Jade Palace. My destiny was long inscribed in the mysterious chart, my bones and features marked for this office. Though I may lack virtue, in death I shall return to my original cohort. Reflecting on past lives, I find no great transgressions. From now on, I shall live out this world’s allotted span, repaying karmic debts in due course. When the years and months are fulfilled, I shall hasten back to my former post—this is certain! It is also my private assurance.\n\nYour faith in me grows ever firmer, your affection ever deeper.

      "translated_text": "The hour of *mao* belongs to *Zhen*, and *Zhen* governs thunder; yet the Western Terrace pertains to Metal, and Metal resides in the West, where it restrains the eastern *Zhen*—such is the overcoming of Wood by Metal. Thus, whenever thunder arises, the Western Terrace must command its destiny. The authority behind its issuance lies with the officials of the Thunder Department, yet they know not of the Jade Pivot, nor of the Immortal Capital, nor even of the Western Terrace. Most are but functionaries of the Bureau of Envoys or lesser offices. When their time in this world ends, if they have no merit or conduct to their name, so be it; but if they possess merit, they may enter the ranks of the Thunder Officials—yet their baseness and defilement are too grave to recount, much like those of Fengdu who, upon death, become mere ghostly functionaries.\n\nYour appointment and investiture, however, have already placed you within the Immortal Capital and the Western Terrace! I know you possess the capacity for transcendence—why? Because those who may attain immortality share seven traits: first, their karmic debts to wives and children are light, and their worldly ties are sparse; second, their nature is serene and numinous, discerning matters before they arise; third, their eyes, hair, and bones resemble those of the forest immortals at dawn; fourth, their minds are fixed upon a single office, like an archer loosing an arrow; fifth, they cultivate and refine themselves day and night without fail; sixth, their every action aligns with the Dao, never straying far from truth; and seventh, their attainment is already complete, yet their years are not yet spent. Ascending from these, what heights could they not reach?\n\nSince my youth, I have been but a speck in the vast spring of humanity, yet I have acted accordingly. Perhaps we may meet again at the confluence of rivers to bid farewell on an appointed day—let this be our settled resolve. Yet your time in this world will not be long! In fond remembrance of the two immortals, I have spoken my heart and recounted these matters, unaware of how lengthy my words have grown. I trust your esteemed gathering is well and that your health remains robust.\n\nOn the fifth day of the eighth month, I respectfully reply.\n\nAs for Master *Haiqiong’s* collected works, I have long since received them in multiple transmissions. I recall that in the late spring of *dingshou* during my younger years, when my teacher journeyed south in his chariot, I was fortunate to pay my respects. Thereafter, like clouds and cranes, we came and went, and with each audience, I was granted a brief respite. Day after day, I attended his seat and heard what I had never heard before—nothing but the discernment of right and wrong, the elucidation of profound mysteries. Returning, I committed these teachings to writing, and they filled the pages abundantly. Though I am but a withered old man, unworthy of my teacher’s instruction, I dared not keep them hidden. Thus, I have compiled them into four volumes, including his *Shengtang Xiaocan* and hymns of praise, to be engraved for posterity. May they serve as a guide for the sea of learning, and perhaps open the eyes and ears of gods and men—this is my humble wish.\n\nWritten with reverence on the *jiazi* day of the late winter of *Xinhai* in the *Chunyou* era by Peng Xiang of Helin, foremost disciple of the White Patriarch.\n\nThe above words were composed by the Perfected Peng Helin, a disciple of the White Patriarch. The Perfected One hails from a great clan of the Three Mountains, akin to the lineage of Yang and Xu, the chroniclers of Mount Mao. This compilation was entrusted for transmission and reception. I once obtained a copy of the Perfected One’s words—a volume from the Tianqing edition of Fuzhou—appended with his postscript. Here, I have transcribed it anew to complete this work, which is preserved in the collection of the Great Constant Fast, the Dharma Master Jiang.\n\nHaving received the Great Rites of the *Jingxiao* from the Patriarch, I often employ the Generals Ju and Hao. This text fully records their names, and the work is wondrously esoteric—just as Master Peng said, it opens the eyes of gods and men. Scholars should ponder it deeply, for therein lies true attainment.\n\nRespectfully inscribed on the eighteenth day of the seventh month in the *renyin* year by Fang Congyi, Student of the Three Caverns’ Scriptures and Registers of the Supreme Clarity, Immortal Minister Assisting the Transformation of the Great Luo, and Libationer of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Gate. Thus concludes the fourth volume of *The Recorded Sayings of the White Perfected of Haiqiong*.",
