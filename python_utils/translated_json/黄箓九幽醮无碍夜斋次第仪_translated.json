The officials offer three passes, while commoners offer one, and the Master grants the *dùdié* (passport) to the host. The host then passes it to a Daoist disciple, who holds it aloft.\n\nThe Daoist assembly raises the *Huáxià* (auspicious banner), escorting it to the outer gate, where an incense altar is set. The host offers incense, tea, wine, and fruit in three portions, bows twice, and presents incense again.\n\nThe Master then declares:\n\n*\"Most reverently, to rescue the lost souls and revive the stagnant spirits, nothing surpasses the wondrous *Huángluò* Fast. To cultivate merit and plant the seeds of transcendence, none excel the *Zǐqīng* Secret Register. Though we offer precious supplies, we must rely on the Celestial Treasury. Now, as we establish this sacred ritual, we seek divine appointment to fulfill our duty.*\n\n*Though the Nine Directions share the same realm, they are all governed by the Hidden Sovereign. Though the Ten Thousands of domains differ, they are all divided under the Sacred Bureau. We stabilize the sacred land with the cosmic threads, and proclaim the grandeur of the local domain. We follow the rules of the Supreme Void, and uphold the rituals of the Auspicious Hearth.*\n\n*Now, with solemn reverence, the host—[Name], who has committed [seven days, one year, or a taboo date] of transgression—invites [number] Daoists to perform the *Dùpǐn* Fast in honor of the departed. The sacred hall is adorned with brocade, and the Daoist field is opened in ritual order. We uplift sincerity across the Three Realms, relying on the Four Directions to spread our teachings. We rescue the guilty from the Nine Abysses, aiming to open salvation across the Five Paths. May the City Gods, Land Gods, and Village Deities witness this fast and share in its divine fruits.*\n\n*Thus, we first present the sealed talisman to declare our intentions to the Bright Spirits. May the Divine Hearings condescend to grant clear insight.\"*\n\n**Declaration of the Sealed Talisman**\nThe Master again declares:\n\n*\"The intent of this fast has been fully stated in the talisman. Now, all may proceed accordingly. Together, we attend to the affairs of the Jade Platform, that the souls of the departed may ascend to the Spirit Springs. If the spirits are diligent in their divine duties, then the fast’s merit will surely be fulfilled. May the Divine Hearings, in their direct wisdom, accept these words. With deepest devotion, we pray.\"*\n\n**Burning the Talisman, Money, and Horse Offerings**\nBurn the hymns, recite the *huíxiàng* (dedication), and chant the *niànshàn tuì* (merit recitation and retreat).\n\nNext, arrange a single incense stand with flowers, summon a *zhàohún* (Soul-Calling) cloth, and have the host offer incense.\n\nThe Master takes the *zhàohún* cloth—one *zhàng* (3.33 m) long, two *chǐ* (66.67 cm) wide, made of boiled silk—and declares:\n\n*\"Most reverently, the profound teachings of the Daoist lineage encompass all things with boundless compassion. The Spirit Sovereigns, though distant, illuminate the Nine Abysses together.\"*\n\n*\"Most reverently, we honor the grand rites of filial piety and devotion, and humbly proclaim the vast merit of salvation and deliverance. If we diligently uphold the sacred precepts and sincerely forget ourselves beneath the wondrous shelter of the Dao, then the merit of this fast will surely be fulfilled, and the spirits will accept these words with radiant grace. May the Divine Hearings, in their direct wisdom, accept these words. With deepest devotion, we pray.\n\n**Ritual of Inviting the Departed Spirit into the Residence**\nNow, the Master declares:\n\n*\"Most reverently, we hear that though Heaven and Earth endure eternally, they still witness the cycles of decline and renewal; though the sun and moon shine brightly, they follow the natural rhythms of waxing and waning. How much more so for human life within the Three Realms, whose nature is bound by the Five Constants. Who can escape the wheel of rebirth, or evade the cycle of birth and death? For all that is born must eventually perish, and all that begins must have an end. Thus, Zhuang Zhou lamented his dream of the butterfly, and the Sage of Lu sighed at the passing river. Even the sages could not evade it, and the common folk cannot escape. Now, the host, most devoutly, offers this fast for the departed certain person, who has left this bright world and entered the dark abode. Filial offerings are exhausted in pious sincerity, and this sacred assembly is specially convened this night.\n\nNow, the solemn rites are richly arrayed, and the Daoist disciples stand in orderly ranks. We invite the departed spirit to take refuge in the Three Treasures. Let all present bear witness in faith—\n\n**Proclaiming the First Refuge: The Precious Dao Treasure**\nTo the Ten Directions’ Most Exalted Ones, the Three Most Honorable Sages, who over countless eons have guided beings and established the Dao in primordial times. With boundless compassion and mercy, they encompass all sentient life. Their jade-like forms and golden countenances are ever worthy of reverence. With devoted hearts, we take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Dao Treasure. May the departed spirit, with all sincerity, take refuge in the Dao. May all acts of faith be fulfilled.\n\n**Proclaiming the Second Refuge: The Precious Scripture Treasure**\nTo the Ten Directions’ worlds, the sacred texts—jewel-lettered, golden-scripted, dragon-carved, phoenix-sealed—comprising the Thirty-Six Divisions and Eighteen Thousand Sutras, which guide the lost and elevate them to the Dao’s shore. Each line extinguishes sins, each word dispels calamities. In this life and all future rebirths, may these teachings be ever honored. With devoted hearts, we take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Scripture Treasure. May the departed spirit open their heart to understanding and uphold, recite, and transmit these teachings.\n\n**Proclaiming the Third Refuge: The Precious Master Treasure**\nTo the Most Venerable Sage of the Mystic Dao, the Three Teachers of Ancient Times, the Orthodox True Person, and the Three Celestial Patriarchs—who in the Ten Directions’ worlds have attained the Dao and become divine immortals. They transmit the law, deliver the scriptures, and guide all beings. They are the True Parents, the Great Physicians. In this life and all future rebirths, may their teachings be ever honored. With devoted hearts, we take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Master Treasure. May the departed spirit ascend the Path of the Dao without obstruction.\n\nAgain, the Master declares:\n\n*\"Most reverently, with the wondrous grace of the Jade Void, we proclaim the vast merit of salvation and deliverance.\"*\n\nThe **Ceremonial Rites of Filial Offerings** are inscribed and revealed in sacred script.\nWith reverence, we follow the hidden precepts and humbly serve the departed spirits.\n\nNow, the **Jade Dao’s** hymns resound, and the **Celestial Edicts** are proclaimed.\nThe **Heavenly Scripts** in cloud-like seals have been bestowed upon auspicious destinies;\nSwiftly ascending the **Whirlwind Chariot**, their marvelous responses are now manifest.\nThey gaze upon the **Purple Cosmos** and ascend the **Crimson Peaks**.\n\nWe have heard the names of the **Three Treasures** and proclaim the **Ten Directions’** sublime titles.\nWith devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—\n**To the Eastern Nine-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.\nWe kowtow to the **Eastern Master, the Jade Treasure Imperial Sovereign**,\nWho holds the **Green Flower Scepter** and guides this departed spirit\nTo the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—\n**To the Southern Three-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.\nWe kowtow to the **Southern Master, the Mystic True One of Ten Blessings**,\nWho holds the **Crimson Cloud Scepter** and guides this departed spirit\nTo the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—\n**To the Western Seven-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.\nWe kowtow to the **Western Master, the Supreme Most Mystic Sovereign**,\nWho holds the **Pure Spirit Scepter** and guides this departed spirit\nTo the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—\n**To the Northern Five-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.\nWe kowtow to the **Northern Master, the Mystic Supreme Dawn Sovereign**,\nWho holds the **Mystic Spirit Scepter** and guides this departed spirit\nTo the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—\n**To the Northeast Prajna-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.\nWe kowtow to the **Northeast Master, the Transcendent Sage Sovereign**,\nWho holds the **Emerald Cloud Scepter** and guides this departed spirit\nTo the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—\n**To the Southeast Prajna-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.\nWe kowtow to the **Southeast Master, the Benevolent Life-Saving Sovereign**,\nWho holds the **Crimson Mist Scepter** and guides this departed spirit\nTo the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—\n**To the Southwest Prajna-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.\nWe kowtow to the **Southwest Master, the Supreme Void Sovereign**,\nWho holds the **Piercing Spirit Scepter** and guides this departed spirit\nTo the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—\n**To the Northwest Prajna-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.\nWe kowtow to the **Northwest Master, the Boundless Great Hua Sovereign**,\nWho holds the **Purple-Haired Scepter** and guides this departed spirit\nTo the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—\n**To the Upper Great Luo Heavenly Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.\nWe kowtow to the **Upper Master, the Jade Void Illustrious Sovereign**,\nWho holds the **Life-Demons-Subduing Scepter** and guides this departed spirit\nTo the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—\n**To the Lower Nine-Palace Imperial Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.\nWe kowtow to the **Lower Master, the True Sovereign of the Cavern Spirit**,\nWho holds the **Soul-Summoning Scepter** and guides this departed spirit\nTo the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.\n\nNext, we chant the **Ten Directions’ Void Realm**, all Heavenly Sovereigns,\nAnd with pious hearts, we repent for the departed spirit.\n\n**Repentance Begins**\nWith devoted hearts, we repent for the departed spirit.\nWe repent for **bodily karmic offenses**, the boundless sins of the body.\nCountless and immeasurable, they arise in every movement—\nStained by dust and defilement, adorned with greed and indulgence,\nArrogant and insolent toward the world.\nNow before the **Great Compassionate One**, we humbly confess.\nMay these bodily karmic offenses be erased, never to arise again.\nMay purity align with the **Immortal Dao**, forever free from the **Three Realms’** confines.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we repent for the departed spirit.\nWe repent for **mental karmic offenses**, the boundless sins of the mind.\nCountless and immeasurable, they stem from anger and hatred,\nLove and aversion—all arising from the heart,\nLust and delusion, jealousy toward the world.\nNow before the **Great Compassionate One**, we humbly confess.\nMay these mental karmic offenses be erased, never to arise again.\nMay wisdom illuminate, penetrating the **Mystic and Profound**.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we repent for the departed spirit.\nWe repent for **verbal karmic offenses**, the boundless sins of speech.\nCountless and immeasurable, they include slander and falsehood,\nDefaming the **Sutras and Teachings**, consuming sentient beings,\nHumiliating the world.\nNow before the **Great Compassionate One**, we humbly confess.\nMay these verbal karmic offenses be erased, never to arise again.\nMay all false speech cease, and the **True Sutras** be forever proclaimed.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we kowtow and give thanks to the **Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures**.\n\nNext, we recite the **Great Dao’s Mystic Void Hymn**.\nNext, we chant the **Three Paths and Five Sufferings Ode**.\nNext, we lament with a solemn declaration.\n\n「From time immemorial, we extol the boundless **virtue/power** of tenfold devotion,\nA limitless cause of triumph and merit.\nMay the departed spirit, with sincere wish,\nAscend to the heavenly realm,\nWhere flower-laden palanquins await beneath the clouds,\nAnd celestial banners descend from the sky to guide them.\nAmidst the cypress groves and sacred trees,\nThey shall forever hear the **True Sutras**.\nBy the moonlit pools of jewels,\nThey shall distantly hear the sublime **Yāgā** (雅梵).\nAll sins committed in life shall now be erased;\nIn death, the **Three Paths** (三涂) shall be dispelled by this virtue.\nRiding dragons or charioted by cranes,\nThey shall wander freely in the tenfold heavens of boundless expanse;\nEnlightened by the **Dao/Way**, they shall transcend the **Three Pure Ones** (三清).\nTheir blessings shall flow to the living,\nAnd their fruits shall manifest in the future.\nDo not let them stray now—\nEarly separation is not to be compared.\nTruly, the **Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures** (列圣) observe with benevolent discernment,\nAnd all sentient beings with wisdom shall ascend the **True Dao/Way** (正道).\n\nNext, we dedicate merit to the departed spirit and recite the **Prayer for Retreating Merit** (念善退).\nThen, in the stillness of night before the **Mystic Profound Master** (玄师),\nWe sing praises and walk the **Dao/Way** (行道).\nThe ritual procession leads them down from the stage to stand before the **Nine Underworld Lamps** (九幽灯).\nNext, we light the **Nine Underworld Lamps** (关九幽地狱灯).\nNext, we **invoke the waters** (勑水).\nNext, we ascend the platform (升坛).\nNext, we face the west (面西),\nAnd invoke the **Three Teachers** (三师).\nNext, we proclaim the **Establishment of the Platform and Ritual Precepts** (建坛说戒仪).\n\nOn the second day at dawn,\nWe sing praises and walk the **Dao/Way** (行道),\nAnd recite the **Scriptures of the Orthodox** (宣科出官),\nAll in accordance with the customary rites.\nAt noon as before,\nIn the stillness of night, we walk the **Dao/Way** (行道),\nAnd recite the **Scriptures of the Orthodox** until the **Threefold Invocations and Threefold Prostrations** (三启三礼) are complete.\nThen, let one **Daoist priest** (道流) approach and invoke the **Thirty-Six Officers of the Underworld** (三十六位上章灵官),\nOffering incense, tea, wine, and fruit as **sacrificial offerings** (供养).\nNext, the **Daoist priest** (法师) takes his position and recites the **Scriptures of the Orthodox** (出官),\nProstrating before the **Duke of the Underworld** (酆都拔) to summon the departed spirit (拔亡章).\nNext, we read the **Scriptures** (读章).\nNext, we dispatch the **Officers** (遣官) to subdue and pacify.\nNext, we solemnly conclude the rites in accordance with the **Daoist precepts** (依仪大谢).\nNext, we invite the **Scriptures** (迎章) to the stage and burn them.\nNext, we burn the **Scriptures** and recite the **Ode of Retreating Merit** (回向),\nAnd the **Prayer for Retreating Merit** (念善退).\nThe assembly disperses at the **first watch of the day** (日初更).\nThe platform is dismantled, all in accordance with customary rites (散坛，一依常仪).\nNext, we send off the **Three Teachers** (送三师).\nNext, we proceed before the **Mystic Profound Master** (诣玄师前),\nAnd invoke the **White Lustration** (请白) as before.\n\nAt the **second watch of the night** (二更初),\nWe go before the departed spirit (诣亡灵前),\nAnd request the **bath of purification** (请浴).\nNext, the **Daoist priest** (法师) solemnly declares:\n*\"In the depths of the Yellow Springs, darkness shrouds the soul,\nCongealed and polluted, staining the spirit.\nIn the black soil of the Underworld, filth accumulates,\nBuried and suffocating, the departed’s vitality.\nThrough endless nights of gloom, they struggle to ascend.\nThus, the **Supreme Orthodox Master** (太上) in mercy,\nAnd the **Celestial Sovereign** (元皇) in compassion,\nBestows the **Law of Washing Away Earthly Toil** (洗涤尘劳之法),\nAnd proclaims the **Ritual of Bathing and Refining the Spirit** (沐浴炼度之科).\nSo that the **karmic bonds** (业网) are severed,\nAnd the **source of sins** (罪源) is absolved.\n\nNow we solemnly prepare the **Jewel Chamber** (宝室),\nAnd purify the **Orchid Bath** (兰汤).\nWe set the **Five Fragrant Ritual of Bathing and Ablution** (五香澡盥之仪),\nAnd follow the **Threefold Canon of Rescue and Liberation** (三箓拯拔之格).\nWe humbly invite the departed **so-and-so** (亡过某人),\nTo the **Bathing Hall** (浴室) to wash and cleanse,\nTo purify their turbid **qi** and restore clarity.\nWhen the rites are complete, they shall be adorned in solemn splendor,\nAnd return to their place to receive the **Law**.\n\nNext, the ritual procession guides the departed spirit to the **Bathing Hall** (往浴室),\nAnd along the way, let one **Daoist priest** (道流) sprinkle holy water,\nReciting the **Great Hidden Mantra of All Celestial Beings** (诸天内音大梵隐语),\nTo clear the path and lead them to the bath.\n\nNext, the ritual concludes (法事止).\nNext, let one **Daoist priest** (道流) stand by the **bathing basin** (浴盆),\nAnd with a wooden ladle begin from the southwest,\nStirring thirty-two times to the left,\nReciting the **Mantra of Bathing and Purifying Filth** (沐浴荡秽咒):\n*\"The **Heavenly Qi** (天澄) clears, the **Essential Qi** (炁) brightens,\nFive radiant hues illuminate the high heavens.\nThe sun and moon emit their splendor,\nPurifying and refining the form.\nWithin the **Divine Pool** (神津), they wash with fragrant waters,\nRefining the essence, the light shines clear.\nThe **Heavenly Pure Ones** (上清) are radiantly revealed.\nThe **Essential Qi** (炁) shall not receive defilement,\nAnd the **Five Palaces** (五府) shall receive the spirit.\nThe **Three Paths** (三涂) are extinguished, the **Nine Underworlds** (九冥) are dispelled.\nThe **roots of evil** (恶根) are severed, blessings spontaneously arise.\nToday’s grand vow is now fully proclaimed.\nThe body receives liberation, ascending to the **Celestial Court** (帝庭).\n\nNext, we again recite the **Mantra of Bathing and Refining the True Essence** (沐浴炼真咒):\n*\"The **Supreme Orthodox Master** (太上高真), essence of the **Nine Spirits** (九灵).\nLifting the soul to heaven, ascending the **Purple Court** (紫庭).\nBathing in the **Flower Pool** (华池), the body and spirit are purified.\nThe essence penetrates the **Great Void** (太虚), all **Essential Qi** (万炁) spontaneously generated.\"*\n\nNext, the **Daoist priest** (法师) recites the **Great Mantra of Bathing in the Crimson Yang and Refining the Departed Soul** (沐浴丹阳炼度亡魂大咒):\n*\"The **Dragon Han Dynasty** (龙汉) flows boundlessly,\nFormless and nameless.\nVast and distant, eons without end,\nThe **Celestial Dao/Way** (皇道) opens to purity.\nThe **Divine Lamps** (神灯) shine bright,\nAnd the **Nine Souls** (九魂) emit their essence.\nThe **Jade Void** (玉虚) clears its radiance,\nAnd the **Great Celestial Mist** (太霞) ascends in splendor.\nThe **Primordial Beginning** (元始) unfolds creation,\nAnd all **celestial beings** (诸天) align in harmony.\nThe **Three Primordial Cycles** (三元) nurture and guide,\nAnd the **Two Symbols** (二象) encompass life.\nThose already refined shall be perfected,\nAnd those not yet complete shall attain clarity.\nThe dead shall be transformed,\nAnd the withered shall bloom anew.\nCrawling insects and stagnant vapors,\nAll spirits and souls are liberated.\nThose who bear life in the womb,\nShall all receive the blessing of rebirth.\nThe departed **so-and-so** (亡者命过) shall pass beyond,\nTheir souls returning to the **Three Pure Ones** (三清).\nTheir **ethereal bodies** (魄) shall be refined,\nAnd in the **Southern Celestial Palace** (南宫), their forms shall be reborn.\nToday’s great fortune is proclaimed—\nAll shall receive illumination.\nThe **Five Emperors** (五帝) observe and reflect,\nAnd all spirits are universally notified.\nThe gods of **Earth and Heaven** (天地神祇),\nAnd all **river sources** (诸河源).\nThe **Five Sacred Mountains and Four Great Rivers** (五岳四渎),\nAnd all **named mountains** (诸名山).\nThe **Mystic Profound** (洞玄), the **Mystic Void** (洞虚),\nThe **Void of Space** (洞空), the **Mystic Immortals** (洞仙).\nThe **Great Saint of the Boundless** (无极大圣),\nAnd the **Supreme True and Sublime Deity** (至真尊神).\nThe **Limitless and Boundless** (无穷无极),\nAll oversee and refine the living.\nThe **earthly roots of sin** (地根) are severed,\nAnd the **Mystic Capital** (玄都) records their names.\nAll gods unite in witness,\nAnd all spirits hear in unison.\"*\n\nNext, the **Daoist priests** (道众) recite the **Ode of Bathing in the Eastern Well** (沐浴东井颂),\nAs in the **Threefold Invocation** (如三启吟),\nAnd display the **Chart of the Twenty-Four Generations** (二十四生图经):\n*\"The **Celestial River** (天河) pours into the **Eastern Well** (东井),\nWhere the **Stone Deities** (石景) and **Water Mother** (水母) gather their essence.\nThe **Round Radiance** (圆光) sweeps across the **Spiritual Luminaries** (灵曜),\nAnd the **Mystic Profound Light** (玄晖) gleams in high clarity.\nThe **Primordial Beginning** (元始) unveils the **Double Night** (重夜),\nAnd **heavenly beings** (天人) follow the **moon’s cycles** (逐月生).\nAbove the **Orchid Pool** (兰池) of bathing,\nDragons bear the **long rope** (长绠) and **bottle** (瓶).\nThe **Golden Boy** (金童) scatters fragrant flowers,\nAnd the **Jade Maiden** (玉女) flows the **Five Stars** (五星).\nWith **jade belts and crowns** (冠带), they wash in the **jewel waters** (玉津),\nRefining the **Five Immortals’ Forms** (五仙形).\nTheir **fragrant bodies** (体香) descend upon all spirits,\nAnd they ascend the **High Clarity** (高清) on the **Celestial Vehicle** (乘景).\nNext, the **Daoist priests** (道众) recite the **Ode of Dispersing the Rites** (散法事毕).\nNext, they roll up the **outer silk curtains** (卷起裹面帘幕).\n\nThen, when the bath is complete,\nThe **Daoist priest** (法师) recites the **Mantra of Crowns and Belts** (冠带咒):\n*\"The **Five Turbidities** (五浊) are now purified,\nAnd the **Eight Landscapes** (八景) are illuminated.\nToday they receive refinement—\nTheir sins are extinguished, their blessings born.\nForevermore, they shall dwell with the **Five Emperors** (五帝),\nAnd ascend to the **High Clarity** (上灵).\nNext, they roll up the **outer curtains** (卷起外面帘).\n\nNext, the **Daoist priests** (道众) recite the **Ode of the Daoist Rite of Water for Refining the Soul** (法水度魂颂):\n*\"Now the **bath of purification** (澡蠲) is completed,\nAnd solemn purity (严洁) is achieved.\nIn **rainbow robes** (霓衣) resplendent and fragrant,\nTheir **cloud-like feet** (云趾) move gently as they leave the chamber.\nBefore the **Three Sublime Ones** (三尊之御),\nWe proclaim the **Alliance of the Nine Keys** (盟九钥之科).\nTransmitting the **precepts** (传戒), receiving the **symbols** (受符),\nThey transcend the mundane and enter the **sacred** (超凡入圣).\nMay they all attain the **wondrous fruits** (妙果),\nAnd swiftly realize the **extraordinary destiny** (殊缘).\nTheir **ethereal souls** (灵魄) preserved,\nShall bow and follow the guidance.\"*\n\nNext, the **rites of the Dao** welcome and guide the departed soul, with a Daoist priest along the path sprinkling purified water and reciting the **celestial mantras and hidden speech** of the *dharma*. Upon reaching the side of the **Three Pure Ones**, they face the northeast corner, set out incense, flowers, and a small table, along with a prayer mat and a small brazier. Before the incense table, they command the departed soul to stand on the mat and listen to the **teachings**.\n\nThen, the **master** humbly addresses the **Three Pure Ones, Most High Saints, and Ten Directions of Spirits**:\n*\"We humbly appeal to Your lofty grace and profound mercy for this devout plea.\nToday, the departed **Over** [name] has completed the rites of incense and purification, now adorned in solemn ritual array.\nBefore the **Most High’s** divine decree, we reverently receive the **true precepts** of return.\nIt is fitting to solemnly purify oneself and reverently follow the **doctrines**.\n\nDo not display the demeanor of arrogance, lest one forfeit the fruits of merit.\nAt that time, **Yuan Shi Tianzun** was in the **Fragrant Grove Garden**, within the **Great Blessing Hall**, teaching the **dharma of life and death, karma, and past virtues** to the celestial hosts, the rulers of the **Three Realms**, and all spirits.\n\nThen, **Jiu Ku Zhenren** respectfully addressed the **Tianzun**:\n*'Your servant has witnessed within the **dark realms and hells**, in the **Northern Prefecture of Luo and Cheng**, that all departed souls suffer torment—some clinging to the **Sword Tree**, others treading the **Mountain of Knives**. Pounded in mortars, roasted in caldrons, their limbs shattered, blood flowing, they endure endless death and rebirth without respite. Yet among them, one stands unharmed, fearless, wandering freely, untouched by suffering. A **auspicious light and sacred qi** shields them—we do not know what merit this person has earned.'*\n\nThe **Tianzun** replied:\n*'Well spoken, well spoken. This person, in life, devoted their heart to the **Dao**, aspiring to virtuous connections. They once received the **Nine True Precepts** and the **True Symbol of Rescue**, carrying the **sacred talisman** and never faltering in their resolve. Thus, their departed soul finds joy and freedom, even within the hells, spared the wheel of suffering. Their name is erased from the **Black Register**, and they forever behold the light. They ascend to the **Southern Palace** and attain the **fruit of immortality**.\n\nNow, before the **Three Pure Ones’** throne and the **Saints’** presence, we transmit the **precepts** for the departed soul. May they, after receiving them, uphold and practice with reverence, forever freed from darkness and ascending to bliss. Let them escape the **judgment of the underworld** and attain the **auspicious karmic ties of purity**.\n\nWe further hope for Your benevolent guidance, secretly aiding their lineage.\nWe follow the **rites and observe the solemnities**, transmitting the **scriptures and precepts** to the departed soul. May their **pure spirit** attentively receive the **sacred words**.\n\nNext, the **gong** sounds, and all bow in reverence.\n\n**First, taking refuge in the Three Treasures**:\nWe proclaim to the departed soul: *\"The first refuge grants the merit of liberating sins and aiding suffering—ineffable and boundless. Now, following the **Tianzun’s** rites, we transmit them in order.\nMay their spirit stand solemnly, listening with devotion.\"*\n\n**Next, the Nine True Precepts are explained to the departed soul**:\n*\"The first, receiving the **True Precept of Initiation**, forbids killing and stealing, practicing an **equal heart**. In future births, they will gain wisdom and clarity—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe second, receiving the **True Precept of Mindfulness**, forbids lust and desire, rejecting false views. In future births, they will gain wisdom and clarity—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe third, receiving the **True Precept of Upholding**, forbids jealousy and coveting unjust wealth. In future births, they will gain wealth and prosperity—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe fourth, receiving the **True Precept of Guarding**, cultivates benevolent thoughts without deceit. In future births, they will gain joy and peace—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe fifth, receiving the **True Precept of Protection**, abstains from alcohol, meat, and harming life. In future births, they will gain purity and ease—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe sixth, receiving the **True Precept of Cultivation**, cherishes all beings and awakens to the **Dao**. In future births, they will gain a **sacred body and virtuous nature**—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe seventh, receiving the **True Precept of Completion**, venerates the **Dao** and practices merit through fasting. In future births, they will manifest the **Ten Auspicious Signs**—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe eighth, receiving the **True Precept of Attainment**, retreats from the world to guide others, avoiding all evil. In future births, they will encounter the **Dao’s teachings**—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe ninth, receiving the **True Precept of Ascension**, honors the **master’s instructions** without slacking. In future births, they will become a **Great Sovereign of the Law**—hold fast to this resolve.*\n\nThus, the **Nine True Precepts**, proclaimed by the **Most High’s** golden mouth, are now received. Having upheld them, their spirit is bound—\nFor the **precepts are strict and their prohibitions weighty**. Relying on the **power of the Nine True**, they forever escape the **Five Sufferings**.

He repents for the defamation of scriptures and destruction of teachings, for failing to take refuge, for disdaining the Dao/Way, betraying the truth, and violating oaths. He repents for the ceaseless delusions of body and mind, for the insatiable cravings of ears and eyes that never cease. For sins committed in past, present, and future lives, and for the roots of transgression in the three worlds that are boundless and incalculable. Today, he vows to repent with all sincerity, seeking to eliminate all past hindrances and afflictions. Having now humbly confessed before the Dao/Way, the myriad saints shall surely witness and judge with impartial clarity.\n\nWith renewed resolve, he repents for the crimes of the six senses—hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking—along with the six desires and six emotions. He repents for the allure of music and song that drowns out true teachings, for the dazzling hues of purple and green that obscure proper colors. He repents for the competition in adornment with fragrant ornaments like orchids and musk, for the boastful display of carriages and horses in their fleeting moments of splendor. He repents for the unbridled indulgence in sweet and bitter tastes that harms one’s life, for the unchecked fluctuations of joy and anger that disrupt harmony. Though the six senses often lead to paths of ruin, the three treasures ever open gates of deliverance. Now, all past transgressions are laid bare, and he earnestly vows to eradicate every root of sin.\n\nWith sincere devotion, he prostrates and offers gratitude to the supreme and true three treasures.\n\nNext, he recites the hymn of the Three Realms and Five Sufferings.\nNext, he invokes the threefold homage.\n\nAll past merits have been fully accomplished.\nHumbly, he hopes the departed soul may now ascend to the radiant and enlightened judgment.\n\nMay the departed soul attain the divine realm of the Jade Purity, its spirit forever dwelling in the crimson peaks.\nMay it wander freely through the ten extremes, dwelling at ease in the Three Pure Ones’ domain.\nMay its blessings flow abundantly, its joy extend to kin and descendants.\nMay all beings, without exception, ascend to the shores of the Dao/Way.\n\nNext, the ritual concludes the summoning of the departed soul, returning it to its spiritual seat, and offers reverent placement.\n\nNext, the chief monk announces:\nNow, having completed the solemn rites before the three treasures and achieved triumphant merit, we must solemnly and respectfully receive the teachings with awe and reverence.\nWe prepare the grand feast, awaiting the opportune moment for its commencement.\nWe offer fragrant and exquisite delicacies, awaiting the fulfillment of the grand cause.\n\nNow, on behalf of the departed soul, we invoke the sacred mantra of the Jade Purity’s luminous and refined offerings:\n*\"Looking back to the circular net of the heavens, containing light and drawing in the soul’s essence.\nBinding the wandering spirit and subduing the seven shades, aligning thoughts with the central Dao/Way.\nMoving, dwelling, and dissolving in the void, sleeping and resting in the hall of jade splendor.\nFeasting on the yellow-walled lotus, quenching thirst with the nectar of the root of immortality.\nThe spirit’s essence merges with the Great Demon, uniting to refine the true light.\nIlluminating the boundless vision, forever wandering in the celestial expanse.\nCircular harmony vanishes at the waves’ edge, true transformation knows no end.\nMysterious and wondrous without beginning or end, the practitioner must know this truth.\nSilent and empty, forgetting all teachings, yet responding to fate’s grand design.\nDescending the Dao/Way, not reflecting upon itself, must first be applied as intended.\nReturning to the origin of the two realms, merging or parting at will.\"*\n\nNext, he announces again with solemnity:\nNow, the sacred rites are fully completed, and the wondrous chants have been fully recited.\nAll causes are gathered, and all resources are provided for the passing soul.\nHumbly, he hopes the departed soul’s spirit may not be lost, its journey boundless in the unseen realms.\nMay it escape the icy courts of the Five Sufferings, forever free from eternal night.\nMay it hear the Dao/Way of the Three Pure Ones, fully attaining the state of non-doing.\nMay blessings grace the household, and joy flow to beloved kin.\nMay all beings, without exception, ascend to the land of boundless virtue and longevity.\n\nWith prostration, he takes refuge in the boundless Great Dao/Way.\n\nNext, the ritual concludes the descent, burning the departed soul’s talismans and written vows.\n\nNext, he recites the hymn for burning the talismans:\n\n*\"The supreme and subtle law, the talismans and scriptures that guide souls to heaven.\nFrom the beginning of time, the sacred talismans were proclaimed.\nAt their appointed hour, all attain elevation and ascent.\nTransmitting teachings to save those drowning in suffering, all may freely soar.\nThe golden talismans bear the name, granting admittance to the Jade Emperor’s realm of boundless ease.\"*\n\nNext, he performs the transfer of merit, reciting blessings for the departed soul’s release.\n\nThen, he goes outside the great gate,\nsets up a table with incense,\nlights the incense,\nand calls upon the homeless, lonely spirits, and lingering souls.\n\nHumbly, he acknowledges that the wondrous Dao/Way of the heavens,\nits virtues vast and profound,\n...\n\nThe august sovereign rules the realm,\nhis virtue extending to both the living and the dead.\nHis boundless grace reaches all creatures,\nand his benevolent influence descends like the night’s dew upon the thirsty.\nAll who dwell in darkness and obscurity\nare granted private aid for their deliverance.\nRevering the Dao/Way and honoring the departed,\nhe saves all beings alike.\n\nAmong them are heroes who aided their nations,\nloyal ministers who served their lords,\nwho, when danger arose, did not spare their own lives\nbut sacrificed themselves for the chariot-borne sovereign.\nSome perished in the desert wastes,\nothers died upon the battlefield.\nTheir bones lay unburied,\ntheir spirits lingering in torment.\n\nSome served in distant outposts,\nrushing on commands to the four quarters.\nThey succumbed to plague or met violent ends,\ntheir lives cut short by injury or misfortune.\nBlocked by ancestral roots or distant kin,\nthey were abandoned in spring, summer, autumn, and winter,\nforsaken in sacrifice.\n\nSome sought fame in distant lands,\ntrading east and west,\ntraversing mountains and rivers, crossing seas.\nThey fell to venomous beasts or perished in raging waves,\ntheir ships dashed upon the rocks.\n\nSome entered the empty gate in youth,\nlong adhering to the Release-Teaching.\nIn seclusion among groves and valleys,\nthey dwelled in solitude, content in quietude,\ntheir hearts yearning for cultivation,\ntheir spirits embracing solitude.\n\nSome wandered as wayfarers,\nsome managed alms for the living.\nDay by day, their lives waned,\ntheir fates drifting toward transformation.\n\nSome loathed the vulgar world,\ntheir hearts set on the realm of immortals.\nThey cultivated the name of pure, unadulterated virtue,\ndwelling in azure peaks beyond the dust of men.\nYet they could not fulfill the Dao/Way of eternal life,\nnor escape the fleeting hours of mortal time.\n\nSome mastered brush and ink, their skill in medicine unmatched.\nThrough such pursuits, they died as strangers in foreign lands.\nSome labored in service, bound in toil and servitude.\nSome were wronged and met dark fates,\nothers, without recourse, took their own lives.\nTheir spirits, restless and unmoored,\ndrifted without refuge.\n\nSome became bandits or rebels,\ntraitorous ministers who defied their sovereign,\nbearing guilt that doomed them to the shadowed depths,\nwhere they dared to resent their fate.\n\nSome scorned the sacred laws,\nor failed to honor their parents,\nand thus incurred celestial wrath, meeting untimely ends,\nor fell under the weight of their crimes.\n\nSome perished in poverty and cold,\nothers fled the law to hide in obscurity.\nDesperate, they took their lives in forests or rivers,\nor were devoured by beasts,\nor burned alive in fire and flood.\n\nMale or female, young or old—\nthough their names may be unknown,\nthey are summoned here in hope.\nFirst, they are purified in sacred baths,\ncleansing their spirits,\nand partake in the feast of the law-assembly.\n\nNow, the devout sponsor, [Name],\noffers rites for the departed [Name],\nmarking the seventh sevens, anniversaries, hundred days, or three-year solemnities,\nand commissions [number] Daoists to venerate the spirit tablet\nor the abode of the departed,\nopening the Supreme Yellow Talisman Great Fast\nfor [number] days and nights.\nA Nine-Depths Pure Expiation is established,\ngolden talismans and scriptures are worshipped,\nofferings of night feasts and spirit-fasts are made,\nand all departed souls ascend to the Dao/Way’s fruit.\n\nHumbly, we beseech the lingering spirits of the underworld,\nthe solitary souls of distant paths—\nthose who respond and come,\nall bathe in the orchid-scented waters;\nunhindered, they enter the feast,\nlistening to the proclamation of teachings and precepts.\nIf their spirits yet linger,\nmay they now partake.\n\nNext, the ritual guides the solitary souls to the bath chamber,\nwith a Daoist along the way,\nwho sprinkles pure water to cleanse impurities,\nreciting the hidden mantras of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens.\nUpon reaching the bath chamber,\na Daoist stirs the water in the basin,\nbeginning from the southwest,\ntwisting it thirty-two times to the left,\nand recites the Water of the Law incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Most-High divine water,\nthe numbers of the Five Phases.\nIt nurtures life and gives birth to things,\nwashing away the old to bring forth the new.\nQuenching thirst sustains life,\nwhile death’s sufferings find no relief.\nWere it not for boundless compassion,\nhow could salvation be granted?\"*\nThe Supreme Most-High, the Most Exalted, recites this one line.\n\nNext, they proceed to the women’s bath chamber,\nstirring the water and reciting the same incantation.\nThen, lowering the bath chamber’s curtain,\nthe Daoist assembly chants the Scattering Flowers ritual.\nAfter the bath is complete,\nthe master priest reports:\n\n*\"Again, we invoke the Yellow Earth’s submerged souls,\nthe departed of the spirit platform.\nNow that the orchid bath is complete,\nall have attained purity and emptiness.\nEach abandons evil thoughts,\nharmonizing in concord.\nThey should now take their places in order,\napproaching with reverence to the feast.\nFeasting on fragrant delicacies,\nlet them not cling to delusion.\nAll shall be liberated,\nfreed from the prisons of darkness.\nThrough all future lives,\nmay they dwell forever in the Land of Bliss.\"*\n\nNext, the ritual guides the solitary souls\nto the unmarked feast seats.\nThe master priest and Daoist assembly circumambulate the *jiāogào*,\nchanting the Light-Bringing Hymn:\n\n*\"The Supreme Most-High Dao/Way Lord,\ndwelling in the realm of Non-Action.\nThe Precious Light True Child,\ndescends to govern the Nine-Depths Hall.\nPitiful are the tormented spirits,\nrescued from their sorrow and pain.\nThrough the twenty-four gates,\nall are made to perceive the sacred fragrance.\nLamps illuminate the endless night,\ndissolving the burdens of countless kalpas.\"*\n\nNext, they proceed to the positions of the Underworld officials,\nbreaking the *Twenty-Four Hells Scroll* (as recorded separately),\nand, one by one, dismantling the banners,\nremoving the position plaques.\n\nThen, entering the *Jiāogào*’s southern gate,\nthey chant the *Four-Voiced Summoning of the Sound-Saving Heavenly Worthy*,\nwith the assembly responding in harmony.\n\nNext, they recite the *Unending Lament* three times,\neach time first responding with the Four-Voiced Merit,\nand concluding with the Most Exalted:\n\n*\"The Nine-Depths’ darkness is unbearable—\nall who arrive are sinners alike.\nIn the murky void, light is scarce,\nyet the Most Compassionate Supreme Most-High comes to save.\nGreat Compassion, Great Mercy—\nthe Sound-Saving Heavenly Worthy has arrived.\"\nThe assembly responds: \"The Most Exalted.\"*\n\n*\"Hungry ghosts and wretched spirits are all liberated,\ndebtors and creditors alike tremble in fear.\nMountains of blades and forests of swords are crushed,\ncauldrons of boiling oil and furnaces are extinguished.\nGreat Compassion, Great Mercy—\nthe Sound-Saving Heavenly Worthy has arrived.\"\nThe assembly responds: \"The Most Exalted.\"*\n\n*\"Constructed by hatred and enmity,\nthe hells of suffering—\nyet turning the heart brings joy as heaven.\nThe Most Exalted’s power is unfathomable;\nmay the light of compassion proclaim the teachings.\"\nThe assembly responds: \"The Most Exalted.\"*\n\nNext, the master priest exits through the *Jiāogào*’s northern gate,\nchanting the Four-Voiced Merit alone,\nand recites the *Nine-Depths Lament for the Suffering Spirits*\nas he proceeds to the place of proclamation:\n\n*\"Born into the realm of suffering,\nendlessly cycling through the Five Paths.\nThe Nine-Depths’ eternal night is sealed,\nand kalpas pass without a glimmer of light.\"*\n\nMountains of blades and trees of swords,\npoisoned edges rising in sharp array.\nNo crows gather in sight—\nonly the voices of tormented spirits heard.\nThe howling wind stirs the endless night,\nlamentations echo through the frosty hall.\n\nAbove, the souls who tread the blade-mountains,\nnever know a moment’s peace.\nHunger forces them to eat the crooked well’s embers,\nthirst compels them to drink the molten fire’s essence.\nDragged through the Three Realms of suffering,\ndo they even recognize their own forms or names?\nTo think you know not your fate—\nhow grievous, how cruel to human feeling!\n\nGreat Compassion, Great Mercy—\nthe Sound-Saving Heavenly Worthy has arrived.\nThe assembly responds: *\"The Most Exalted.\"*\n\nNext, the master priest turns toward the Ghost Gate couch,\ntakes his seat in order.\nHe begins the Hall Proclamation Chant,\nthen proclaims the Teaching and Precept Ceremony—\nopening the scripture, closing the scripture,\nexplaining the causes and effects of karma,\nand all within the ritual, the proclamation complete.\nHe recites the *Three Verses on the Heavenly Worthy’s Passing* at its end.\n\nNext, the priestly rites lead him to the outer gate,\nwhere first the departed souls are burned,\nalong with offerings for lonely spirits—\nmoney, silk, and colored goods.\nHe then recites the *Burning Incantation Chant.*\n\nNext, he makes the transfer of merit,\nreciting auspicious verses and dispelling evil.\nHe reascends the incense and flames,\nestablishing the *Nine-Depths Exorcism.*\nFirst, he goes before the Mysterious Master,\nchanting praises and walking the path.\nHe begins the Hall Proclamation Chant,\nthen proclaims the Exorcism Ceremony—\nas before.\nHe recites the *Chant for Escorting the True Souls,*\nthen burns the memorial tablets.\nFinally, he makes the transfer of merit,\nreciting auspicious verses and dispelling evil.\n\n---\n**Nine-Depths Exorcism Ceremony Diagram**\n**Ritual Formulas**\n\nThe **State Memorial

The officials offer three passes, while commoners offer one, and the Master grants the *dùdié* (passport) to the host. The host then passes it to a Daoist disciple, who holds it aloft.\n\nThe Daoist assembly raises the *Huáxià* (auspicious banner), escorting it to the outer gate, where an incense altar is set. The host offers incense, tea, wine, and fruit in three portions, bows twice, and presents incense again.\n\nThe Master then declares:\n\n*\"Most reverently, to rescue the lost souls and revive the stagnant spirits, nothing surpasses the wondrous *Huángluò* Fast. To cultivate merit and plant the seeds of transcendence, none excel the *Zǐqīng* Secret Register. Though we offer precious supplies, we must rely on the Celestial Treasury. Now, as we establish this sacred ritual, we seek divine appointment to fulfill our duty.*\n\n*Though the Nine Directions share the same realm, they are all governed by the Hidden Sovereign. Though the Ten Thousands of domains differ, they are all divided under the Sacred Bureau. We stabilize the sacred land with the cosmic threads, and proclaim the grandeur of the local domain. We follow the rules of the Supreme Void, and uphold the rituals of the Auspicious Hearth.*\n\n*Now, with solemn reverence, the host—[Name], who has committed [seven days, one year, or a taboo date] of transgression—invites [number] Daoists to perform the *Dùpǐn* Fast in honor of the departed. The sacred hall is adorned with brocade, and the Daoist field is opened in ritual order. We uplift sincerity across the Three Realms, relying on the Four Directions to spread our teachings. We rescue the guilty from the Nine Abysses, aiming to open salvation across the Five Paths. May the City Gods, Land Gods, and Village Deities witness this fast and share in its divine fruits.*\n\n*Thus, we first present the sealed talisman to declare our intentions to the Bright Spirits. May the Divine Hearings condescend to grant clear insight.\"*\n\n**Declaration of the Sealed Talisman**\nThe Master again declares:\n\n*\"The intent of this fast has been fully stated in the talisman.

If we diligently uphold the sacred precepts and sincerely forget ourselves beneath the wondrous shelter of the Dao, then the merit of this fast will surely be fulfilled, and the spirits will accept these words with radiant grace. May the Divine Hearings, in their direct wisdom, accept these words. With deepest devotion, we pray.\n\n**Ritual of Inviting the Departed Spirit into the Residence**\nNow, the Master declares:\n\n*\"Most reverently, we hear that though Heaven and Earth endure eternally, they still witness the cycles of decline and renewal; though the sun and moon shine brightly, they follow the natural rhythms of waxing and waning. How much more so for human life within the Three Realms, whose nature is bound by the Five Constants. Who can escape the wheel of rebirth, or evade the cycle of birth and death? For all that is born must eventually perish, and all that begins must have an end. Thus, Zhuang Zhou lamented his dream of the butterfly, and the Sage of Lu sighed at the passing river. Even the sages could not evade it, and the common folk cannot escape. Now, the host, most devoutly, offers this fast for the departed certain person, who has left this bright world and entered the dark abode. Filial offerings are exhausted in pious sincerity, and this sacred assembly is specially convened this night.\n\nNow, the solemn rites are richly arrayed, and the Daoist disciples stand in orderly ranks. We invite the departed spirit to take refuge in the Three Treasures. Let all present bear witness in faith—\n\n**Proclaiming the First Refuge: The Precious Dao Treasure**\nTo the Ten Directions’ Most Exalted Ones, the Three Most Honorable Sages, who over countless eons have guided beings and established the Dao in primordial times. With boundless compassion and mercy, they encompass all sentient life. Their jade-like forms and golden countenances are ever worthy of reverence. With devoted hearts, we take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Dao Treasure. May the departed spirit, with all sincerity, take refuge in the Dao. May all acts of faith be fulfilled.\n\n**Proclaiming the Second Refuge: The Precious Scripture Treasure**\nTo the Ten Directions’ worlds, the sacred texts—jewel-lettered, golden-scripted, dragon-carved, phoenix-sealed—comprising the Thirty-Six Divisions and Eighteen Thousand Sutras, which guide the lost and elevate them to the Dao’s shore. Each line extinguishes sins, each word dispels calamities. In this life and all future rebirths, may these teachings be ever honored. With devoted hearts, we take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Scripture Treasure. May the departed spirit open their heart to understanding and uphold, recite, and transmit these teachings.\n\n**Proclaiming the Third Refuge: The Precious Master Treasure**\nTo the Most Venerable Sage of the Mystic Dao, the Three Teachers of Ancient Times, the Orthodox True Person, and the Three Celestial Patriarchs—who in the Ten Directions’ worlds have attained the Dao and become divine immortals. They transmit the law, deliver the scriptures, and guide all beings. They are the True Parents, the Great Physicians. In this life and all future rebirths, may their teachings be ever honored. With devoted hearts, we take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Master Treasure. May the departed spirit ascend the Path of the Dao without obstruction.\n\nAgain, the Master declares:\n\n*\"Most reverently, with the wondrous grace of the Jade Void, we proclaim the vast merit of salvation and deliverance.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Next, the **rites of the Dao** welcome and guide the departed soul, with a Daoist priest along the path sprinkling purified water and reciting the **celestial mantras and hidden speech** of the *dharma*. Upon reaching the side of the **Three Pure Ones**, they face the northeast corner, set out incense, flowers, and a small table, along with a prayer mat and a small brazier. Before the incense table, they command the departed soul to stand on the mat and listen to the **teachings**.\n\nThen, the **master** humbly addresses the **Three Pure Ones, Most High Saints, and Ten Directions of Spirits**:\n*\"We humbly appeal to Your lofty grace and profound mercy for this devout plea.\nToday, the departed **Over** [name] has completed the rites of incense and purification, now adorned in solemn ritual array.\nBefore the **Most High’s** divine decree, we reverently receive the **true precepts** of return.\nIt is fitting to solemnly purify oneself and reverently follow the **doctrines**.\n\nDo not display the demeanor of arrogance, lest one forfeit the fruits of merit.\nAt that time, **Yuan Shi Tianzun** was in the **Fragrant Grove Garden**, within the **Great Blessing Hall**, teaching the **dharma of life and death, karma, and past virtues** to the celestial hosts, the rulers of the **Three Realms**, and all spirits.\n\nThen, **Jiu Ku Zhenren** respectfully addressed the **Tianzun**:\n*'Your servant has witnessed within the **dark realms and hells**, in the **Northern Prefecture of Luo and Cheng**, that all departed souls suffer torment—some clinging to the **Sword Tree**, others treading the **Mountain of Knives**. Pounded in mortars, roasted in caldrons, their limbs shattered, blood flowing, they endure endless death and rebirth without respite. Yet among them, one stands unharmed, fearless, wandering freely, untouched by suffering. A **auspicious light and sacred qi** shields them—we do not know what merit this person has earned.'*\n\nThe **Tianzun** replied:\n*'Well spoken, well spoken. This person, in life, devoted their heart to the **Dao**, aspiring to virtuous connections. They once received the **Nine True Precepts** and the **True Symbol of Rescue**, carrying the **sacred talisman** and never faltering in their resolve. Thus, their departed soul finds joy and freedom, even within the hells, spared the wheel of suffering. Their name is erased from the **Black Register**, and they forever behold the light. They ascend to the **Southern Palace** and attain the **fruit of immortality**.\n\nNow, before the **Three Pure Ones’** throne and the **Saints’** presence, we transmit the **precepts** for the departed soul. May they, after receiving them, uphold and practice with reverence, forever freed from darkness and ascending to bliss. Let them escape the **judgment of the underworld** and attain the **auspicious karmic ties of purity**.\n\nWe further hope for Your benevolent guidance, secretly aiding their lineage.\nWe follow the **rites and observe the solemnities**, transmitting the **scriptures and precepts** to the departed soul. May their **pure spirit** attentively receive the **sacred words**.\n\nNext, the **gong** sounds, and all bow in reverence.\n\n**First, taking refuge in the Three Treasures**:\nWe proclaim to the departed soul: *\"The first refuge grants the merit of liberating sins and aiding suffering—ineffable and boundless. Now, following the **Tianzun’s** rites, we transmit them in order.\nMay their spirit stand solemnly, listening with devotion.\"*\n\n**Next, the Nine True Precepts are explained to the departed soul**:\n*\"The first, receiving the **True Precept of Initiation**, forbids killing and stealing, practicing an **equal heart**. In future births, they will gain wisdom and clarity—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe second, receiving the **True Precept of Mindfulness**, forbids lust and desire, rejecting false views. In future births, they will gain wisdom and clarity—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe third, receiving the **True Precept of Upholding**, forbids jealousy and coveting unjust wealth. In future births, they will gain wealth and prosperity—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe fourth, receiving the **True Precept of Guarding**, cultivates benevolent thoughts without deceit. In future births, they will gain joy and peace—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe fifth, receiving the **True Precept of Protection**, abstains from alcohol, meat, and harming life. In future births, they will gain purity and ease—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe sixth, receiving the **True Precept of Cultivation**, cherishes all beings and awakens to the **Dao**. In future births, they will gain a **sacred body and virtuous nature**—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe seventh, receiving the **True Precept of Completion**, venerates the **Dao** and practices merit through fasting. In future births, they will manifest the **Ten Auspicious Signs**—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe eighth, receiving the **True Precept of Attainment**, retreats from the world to guide others, avoiding all evil. In future births, they will encounter the **Dao’s teachings**—hold fast to this resolve.\nThe ninth, receiving the **True Precept of Ascension**, honors the **master’s instructions** without slacking. In future births, they will become a **Great Sovereign of the Law**—hold fast to this resolve.*\n\nThus, the **Nine True Precepts**, proclaimed by the **Most High’s** golden mouth, are now received. Having upheld them, their spirit is bound—\nFor the **precepts are strict and their prohibitions weighty**. Relying on the **power of the Nine True**, they forever escape the **Five Sufferings**. They ascend directly to the **Southern Palace**, entering the **Purple Bureaus**, where **Golden Boys** guide them and **Jade Girls** welcome them in joy and ease.\n\nThe **Supreme Dao Treasure, the Ten Directions of Saints, and the Three Most High Ones** have, across countless eons, saved beings and established the **pre-heaven teachings**. With boundless compassion, they rescue all life. Their **jade forms and golden countenances** should always be revered.\nWith sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Ten Directions’ Dao Treasures**.\nMay the departed soul, with a pure heart, turn toward all and pay homage.\n\n**Second refuge in the **Supreme Scripture Treasure****:\nThe **Ten Directions’ sacred texts**—**spiritual writings, golden scriptures, dragon-carved phoenix-sealed, thirty-six divisions, eighteen thousand sutras**—guide the lost to transcend the **Dao’s shores**. Each line erases sins, each word dispels calamity. In this life and beyond, they should always be revered.\nWith sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Ten Directions’ Scripture Treasures**.\nMay the departed soul’s heart open to enlightenment, receiving and reciting them.\n\n**Third refuge in the **Supreme Teacher Treasure****:\nThe **Mystic Sage of the Void, the Three Teachers of the Numinous Treasure, the Authentic One of Oneness, the Three Heavenly Masters, and the Ten Directions’ perfected immortals.***\"*",

      "translated_text": "「Next, the chief monk kneels and offers repentance.\nWith sincere resolve, he repents on behalf of the departed soul for the crimes of excessive greed, wrath, anger, folly, and ignorance—transgressions of licentiousness, theft, murder, and life-taking. He repents for the defamation of scriptures and destruction of teachings, for failing to take refuge, for disdaining the Dao/Way, betraying the truth, and violating oaths. He repents for the ceaseless delusions of body and mind, for the insatiable cravings of ears and eyes that never cease. For sins committed in past, present, and future lives, and for the roots of transgression in the three worlds that are boundless and incalculable. Today, he vows to repent with all sincerity, seeking to eliminate all past hindrances and afflictions. Having now humbly confessed before the Dao/Way, the myriad saints shall surely witness and judge with impartial clarity.\n\nWith renewed resolve, he repents for the crimes of the six senses—hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking—along with the six desires and six emotions. He repents for the allure of music and song that drowns out true teachings, for the dazzling hues of purple and green that obscure proper colors. He repents for the competition in adornment with fragrant ornaments like orchids and musk, for the boastful display of carriages and horses in their fleeting moments of splendor. He repents for the unbridled indulgence in sweet and bitter tastes that harms one’s life, for the unchecked fluctuations of joy and anger that disrupt harmony. Though the six senses often lead to paths of ruin, the three treasures ever open gates of deliverance. Now, all past transgressions are laid bare, and he earnestly vows to eradicate every root of sin.\n\nWith sincere devotion, he prostrates and offers gratitude to the supreme and true three treasures.\n\nNext, he recites the hymn of the Three Realms and Five Sufferings.\nNext, he invokes the threefold homage.\n\nAll past merits have been fully accomplished.\nHumbly, he hopes the departed soul may now ascend to the radiant and enlightened judgment.\n\nMay the departed soul attain the divine realm of the Jade Purity, its spirit forever dwelling in the crimson peaks.\nMay it wander freely through the ten extremes, dwelling at ease in the Three Pure Ones’ domain.\nMay its blessings flow abundantly, its joy extend to kin and descendants.\nMay all beings, without exception, ascend to the shores of the Dao/Way.\n\nNext, the ritual concludes the summoning of the departed soul, returning it to its spiritual seat, and offers reverent placement.\n\nNext, the chief monk announces:\nNow, having completed the solemn rites before the three treasures and achieved triumphant merit, we must solemnly and respectfully receive the teachings with awe and reverence.\nWe prepare the grand feast, awaiting the opportune moment for its commencement.\nWe offer fragrant and exquisite delicacies, awaiting the fulfillment of the grand cause.\n\nNow, on behalf of the departed soul, we invoke the sacred mantra of the Jade Purity’s luminous and refined offerings:\n*\"Looking back to the circular net of the heavens, containing light and drawing in the soul’s essence.\nBinding the wandering spirit and subduing the seven shades, aligning thoughts with the central Dao/Way.\nMoving, dwelling, and dissolving in the void, sleeping and resting in the hall of jade splendor.\nFeasting on the yellow-walled lotus, quenching thirst with the nectar of the root of immortality.\nThe spirit’s essence merges with the Great Demon, uniting to refine the true light.\nIlluminating the boundless vision, forever wandering in the celestial expanse.\nCircular harmony vanishes at the waves’ edge, true transformation knows no end.\nMysterious and wondrous without beginning or end, the practitioner must know this truth.\nSilent and empty, forgetting all teachings, yet responding to fate’s grand design.\nDescending the Dao/Way, not reflecting upon itself, must first be applied as intended.\nReturning to the origin of the two realms, merging or parting at will.\"*\n\nNext, he announces again with solemnity:\nNow, the sacred rites are fully completed, and the wondrous chants have been fully recited.\nAll causes are gathered, and all resources are provided for the passing soul.\nHumbly, he hopes the departed soul’s spirit may not be lost, its journey boundless in the unseen realms.\nMay it escape the icy courts of the Five Sufferings, forever free from eternal night.\nMay it hear the Dao/Way of the Three Pure Ones, fully attaining the state of non-doing.\nMay blessings grace the household, and joy flow to beloved kin.\nMay all beings, without exception, ascend to the land of boundless virtue and longevity.\n\nWith prostration, he takes refuge in the boundless Great Dao/Way.\n\nNext, the ritual concludes the descent, burning the departed soul’s talismans and written vows.\n\nNext, he recites the hymn for burning the talismans:\n\n*\"The supreme and subtle law, the talismans and scriptures that guide souls to heaven.\nFrom the beginning of time, the sacred talismans were proclaimed.\nAt their appointed hour, all attain elevation and ascent.\nTransmitting teachings to save those drowning in suffering, all may freely soar.\nThe golden talismans bear the name, granting admittance to the Jade Emperor’s realm of boundless ease.\"*\n\nNext, he performs the transfer of merit, reciting blessings for the departed soul’s release.\n\nThen, he goes outside the great gate,\nsets up a table with incense,\nlights the incense,\nand calls upon the homeless, lonely spirits, and lingering souls.\n\nHumbly, he acknowledges that the wondrous Dao/Way of the heavens,\nits virtues vast and profound,\n...",
