The Temple of the Divine Aid Kings stands as the revered sanctuary of the region, its sheltering canopy and blessings sought by all. In its early years, those who sought fortune and entreated the divine often resorted to spirit-writing with planchettes, inscribing couplets or cryptic verses. Though the miracles and proofs of efficacy remain vivid in memory, no written records were then preserved.\n\nLater, villagers gathered beneath the temple’s eaves to pray, gazing upon its dilapidated halls—roofs sagging, beams rotting, murals dimmed—and said to one another: *\"Can this truly convey our reverence or secure the spirits’ favor?\"* They resolved to restore it, divining the gods’ will through the planchette. Thus, the divine responded with resounding clarity, revealing texts to guide the work. Once the labor was complete, the gods spoke again, their words—every phrase and utterance—now rendered in writing. From then on, long compositions and brief verses emerged in profusion, their brilliance dazzling the eye, their fluency loosening the scribe’s wrist. The gods’ writings surged forth like a boundless flood, their influence spreading to neighboring towns and villages, where people copied them with awe, transcribing, annotating, debating, and marveling. Could such words ever spring from mortal lips?\n\nIt is said that when the imperial plaque was first petitioned, the gods’ surnames and given names were unknown. Elders, drawing on ancient lore, settled on the surname *Xu*. Though the surname was thus established, the finer details of their lineage and titles remained obscure. Now, however, the origins of their illustrious legacy and the abundance of their miraculous deeds are fully revealed. The gods are one in essence, not withholding their favor in the past. After years of entreaty, they now manifest thus, startling even the most discerning. Perhaps this flourishing of texts presages the gods’ intent to herald their blessings and unveil their power—or perhaps their transformative will acts with purpose. Ah! Those who would fathom the gods’ hearts must understand: like torrents surging against the current, their roar is deafening, yet the silent flow at midstream is mightier still. In revealing their words to humanity, the gods act not by choice but by necessity.\n\nIn the Three Dynasties, there were no \"men of letters\"; the Six Classics contain no \"rules of composition.\" The sagely and wise who left writings for posterity did not craft them for ostentation. The subtleties of ruler-minister relations compelled Confucius to write the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. The fading of benevolence and righteousness moved Mencius to compose his seven chapters. Had the Kingly Way prevailed, the works of the magistrate of Lanling might never have been written. Had rites and music been restored, poetry would not have perished, and Master Wen might have played his zither by the Fen River—what need would there have been for transformation? Yet if the transmission to later generations does not rely on texts, on what else could it depend?\n\nThe gods’ intent aligns with that of the sages and worthies. They grant steles to reveal their deeds, divination slips to foretell fortune and misfortune. When mountains and rivers fade into obscurity, they compose texts to reclaim them. When customs grow base and corrupt, they write *The Ballad of Liangfu* to satirize them. As reverence wanes and the scholar’s spirit decays, they pen *The Last Poem* and *The Rhapsody Against the Gods* to admonish. Even *The Song of the Unicorn* and self-defense essays, along with poems of shifting forms—elegant, upright, strange, and rugged—abound in myriad styles, like a cascade of radiant verses or the harmonious utility of grain, cloth, and silk. Such is the nature of their writings—how could it be mere chapters, lines, and punctuation?\n\nIf the people of this village recite the gods’ texts and reflect upon their intent, the entire community will be steeped in Dao and virtue. In every hamlet of ten households, loyalty and trust will flourish. Whether tilling the fields, plying trades, engaging in commerce, laboring, or resolving disputes—whether through courtesy, deference, litigation, friendship, or leisure—they will honor the fundamental. At such a time, they may wander in the realm of the sages and ascend to the unfathomable heavens. Why, then, should the gods’ writings be confined to temple inscriptions? The reverse side of the stele reads: *\"Though I have imitated even a fraction of Master Liu’s skill, without Master Wen to record it, how can I instruct future generations?\"*\n\nYet in Han Yu’s records, beyond filial piety toward parents, wifely obedience to husbands, and the virtues of kindness, brotherly love, and fraternal duty, there is little superfluous language. The gods’ bequest to later generations through Master Wen was nothing more than a devotion to upholding the world’s teachings. Alas! My talents are meager—how dare I aspire to even a fraction of Master Wen’s brilliance? Like a turtle’s eye or a cicada’s wing, I dare not chirp beneath the thunder. Yet I recall that since the Later Jin’s Kaiyun era, the gods have dwelled in Min. My ancestors, too, migrated from Gushi to Min during the Five Dynasties. Over generations, some developed the land to build the gods’ temple, while others petitioned the court to honor their divine titles. The worship of these gods has endured for years. Now, the villagers, united in purpose, have contributed to its restoration, hoping for the gods’ boundless protection. How could I remain silent?\n\nAs for the gods’ surnames, their generational names, their illustrious deeds, and the miracles they have wrought—along with the temple’s founding and renovations—these are all detailed in the gods’ own inscriptions. A mere scribe like myself has no place to interject. My purpose here is merely to elucidate the gods’ intent in composing these texts: that the people of this land, nourished by its mulberries and hemp, may cherish its harmonious melodies. If all cultivate Dao and virtue, returning to loyalty and trust, then even the simplest offerings—jade-like wine in a worm-eaten ladle, minced pork and tender chicken, or river weeds and stream water—will suffice to answer the gods’ hearts.\n\nWithout teachings, the gods’ grace and humanity’s blessings would be limitless, cycling endlessly without cease.\n\nThe gods’ writings herald auspicious omens, unfolding numinous power for those who came before, while their literary brilliance soars like blossoms, bearing fruit for those who follow. Thus shall we witness the celestial favor of ennobling titles bestowed, the gods’ glory resplendent in full display. (On the tenth day of the first lunar month), purple mists swirl and azure clouds rise, golden cups overflow with peppered wine—such is the height of human splendor. At such a time, there must surely be a brush as grand as a rafter to record these events. I shall await with keen eyes, lest Master Wen alone claim the beauty of Magistrate Liu’s legacy.\n\nMoreover, south of the Min River and beyond the Yangtze Gorges, a towering mountain rises—Mount Aofeng. To its south lies the Divine Aid Immortal Palace. Long ago, the humble shrine’s hidden traces became manifest; the state drew upon its merit, the people relied on its protection. Honors were bestowed, titles conferred, and rites observed with reverence—even to this day, how flourishing! Yet over the years, the temple’s beams and rafters have decayed beyond repair, its vermilion and azure hues fading into obscurity.\n\nOne day, villagers came to the shrine to divine their tasks. Seeing its state, they said to one another: “This is no way to honor the devout or soothe the spirits. Let us restore and renew it, each contributing our utmost.” The gods rejoiced in their earnest resolve and, before descending to compose a text, sought to encourage them. Thus, they pooled their sincerity, gathered funds, and commanded craftsmen to measure materials. Each shouldered their duties without delay: narrow gates were widened, dry ponds replenished.\n\nEvery rotted beam and broken tile was replaced. Colors adorned the statues, robes draped their forms. Civil and martial figures alike were renewed in splendor. Their majestic presence blazed forth, their virtue shone resplendent. All who saw or heard were filled with reverence. Joyful in their offerings, the work was completed—it was the eighth month of autumn.\n\nYet the merit was not their own; they ascribed it to the gods’ favor. Rising at dawn, they prepared offerings and announced the completion, seeking to soothe and honor the divine with due ceremony. They extolled the gods’ power, recounting their deeds across three dynasties, from the Five Dynasties onward, and the blessings bestowed upon the illustrious Empress Dowager. Those who now receive offerings in this temple are remembered in both summary and detail, and thus this record is made.\n\nThe assembled workers were struck with awe, their gazes filled with reverence, their voices murmuring in wonder. The scribe then said: “Before, when we petitioned for the inscribed plaque, the divined surname was Xu. It was as if hidden in the sacred, unknowable. Now we learn it descends from the lineage of King Yan—truly verified! Let us carve this in stone, illuminating the unseen and preserving it for eternity.”\n\nThereafter, literary compositions emerged in layers, the *Yi* hexagrams bore slips for divining fortune, the *Ode of Liangfu* served as exhortation. Was it the gods who composed these? They revealed the obscure and boundless. The sealing of wells had its rules, the avoidance of taboos its prohibitions. Be it odes, rhapsodies, disputations, petitions, melodies, or gāthās—thousands of forms, myriad styles, ever more wondrous. Like cliffs suspended in empty space, towering and sheer. Like waves in a raging storm, surging and roaring.\n\nAh, what writing is this! For writing is the essence of celestial patterns in the heavens, the treasure of charts and texts on earth, the auspicious sign of courtly refinement in humanity. Yet the gods—elusive in the indistinct, dwelling in the unfathomable, unseen in shadow, unheard in echo—now manifest through writing. Why? Their wisdom is pure and upright, their majesty severe. Their numinous power and radiant might soar high. Though unseen, they see all; though unheard, they hear all. Emerging from Qian, entering Kun, spanning past and present. Discerning the future, revealing the past, making the subtle manifest and the hidden clear. Thus they unleash celestial essence, split open earthly treasures, and bring forth the literary auspices of humanity. The gods’ virtue has not waned with heaven. The earth does not withhold its patterns, allowing humanity to unfold this culture.\n\nThe gods wander the realm of the scentless and soundless—this is fitting. Yet to entrust this not to humans but to the gods—how remarkable! The essence of Ao Peak, the brilliance of Dragon’s Head, must give rise to extraordinary figures. May the gods continue to favor this culture! Otherwise, why would such auspicious signs appear?\n\nThe gods’ prose declares: “What I create must serve as proof for future ages, a stepping stone for advancement.”\nThe gods’ poetry says:\n*“Is writing not precious?*\n*The noble one’s glory endures like the leopard’s splendor.”*\n\nWas this my intent? The cycles of creation turn endlessly, nothing departs without return. To make the divine manifest—this lies with humanity.\n\nIts verses read:\n*“Ao Peak winds sinuously,*\n*The Palace of Numinous Aid stands.”*\n\nO radiant are the former worthies, their filial devotion like that of King Yan! Their temple endures through the ages, their sacrifices nourishing the land. The four classes of people and the bounty of the earth all depend on their blessings. Embracing and pacifying all around, their luminous glory shines resplendent. They greatly uphold this culture, bringing forth its auspiciousness. Reverently honoring the divine with solemnity, they repay their origins with utmost devotion. Vows of praise and song endure—through a hundred generations, never forgotten.\n\n*The Record of the Renovation of the Lingji Palace*\n\nWhat humans serve are the gods. What the gods rely upon are humans. On this propitious day of early brightness, the gods manifest their numinous power, their resplendent writings entrusted to those of shared purpose. With reverent awe and vigilance, day and night, they dare not grow remiss. Thus, they adorn the sacred images, commanding the stewards of vestments to prepare the robes. Once completed, the gods themselves compose their own chronicles, inscribing them upon the stele.\n\nHow vast and majestic! How solemn and awe-inspiring—such words could not be uttered by common speech. Stirring and startling, who would not dare to offer all they possess in response?\n\nThose of shared purpose conferred: \"The eastern and western ponds have dried up—how can this fail to diminish the temple’s grandeur? The outer walls are crumbling—how can this inspire reverence in people’s hearts? The well at Dragon’s Head, long a blight upon the land, has already been abandoned. Now, let us seal this well, dig these ponds, and paint these walls to delight the gods’ will. This will also benefit the people—is it not fitting?\"\n\nThey agreed: \"It shall be done.\"\n\nThe gods of the Eastern and Western Academies, long obscured by dust, have been neglected, for the age now favors martial pursuits. Some wish to remove them to make way for military plans. Yet those of shared purpose recall Confucius’ words: *\"Culture must be accompanied by martial readiness, and martial strength by cultural preparedness.\"* Civil governance and military achievement support one another—this is an unchanging principle through a hundred generations. How could it be abandoned? Thus, above, they honor the shrines of the Three Stars of Fortune and Prosperity; below, they enshrine the images of those who assist the state and pacify the people. First civil, then martial—each in its proper place.\n\nThey agreed once more: \"It shall be done.\"\n\nBeyond the gates, the old halls stand; within, the protective barriers are imposing. The vermilion eaves and carved beams gleam brilliantly; the inner courtyards’ adornments are unmatched. Every crack and leak has been meticulously repaired. Only the two storehouses remain lowly and filthy, neglected and decaying.\n\nThe villagers, gripped by great fear, could not endure even a single day’s delay. Once more, they conferred with their colleagues and beseeched the gods, saying: “We have long been engaged in this work, wishing to cease yet unable to rest. Our intent is clear—may the gods comprehend it.” The gods responded in writing: “To restore the temple is difficult, yet we follow where duty leads. How could we fail to grasp your meaning?”\n\nThereupon, they renewed all that was decayed and blackened—rafters and beams, broken and missing roof tiles, uneven and crumbling walls—each made anew. At that time, the gods bestowed a second inscription, naming the storehouses: to the east, “Harmony of Kinship,” and to the west, “Feast of Joy.” Thus, those of humble station might find expression, and their virtues be arrayed in full splendor—abundant, flourishing, and complete in every excellence. Though this was the fruit of their collective effort, it was the gods’ divine power that brought it to pass.\n\nAs the work neared completion, they petitioned Zhang Gongduo, the regional administrator, to bestow an inscription. The temple was then elevated in rank, called a *gong*. The strokes of the brush and the characters’ bold forms dazzled the eye. All who passed by—carriages and crowds filling the roads for days—marveled in admiration, their reverence deepening.\n\nThe stele on the eastern street was the gods’ own composition; the inscription on the western steps, the people’s praise of their virtues. The gods’ literary works, displayed throughout the temple, included steles, records, plaques, eulogies, essays, rhapsodies, memorials, petitions, debates, discussions, prefaces, odes, poems, songs, conduct, and discourses. Their collected works, circulated in the world, shone with brilliance, worthy of recounting.\n\nThe honorific titles bestowed upon Lingji, the ennoblement of the True Man of former dynasties, the proclamation of celestial favor—his virtue resplendent, his renown enduring through the ages. This is what the white-haired elders and humble village officials long to extol, beyond the mere words of the local people.\n\nAfter seven days, they returned with their colleagues, solemnly offering sacrificial animals and wine to perform the rite of completion. Taking their places in the courtyard, they reflected with awe. Three years of diligent service had passed—surely the gods, mindful of their merit, would bless them, granting the villagers shared fortune and ensuring their descendants’ reverence for generations. How could they forget its origin?\n\nNow, they wished to carve this account in stone, yet feared critics might accuse them of monopolizing praise. Thus, they first recorded the date at Lingji Gong, then inscribed this inscription:\n\n*Appointed from the Nine Heavens,*\n*Fearing the divine below.*\n*The gods’ brush stirs awe,*\n*Its might unstoppable.*\n*Adorned in robes and splendor,*\n*As the body’s glory.*\n*“Harmony of Kinship,” “Feast of Joy,”*\n*Names for the halls.*\n*Laborers and craftsmen summoned,*\n*The temple made new.*\n*From all directions they gathered,*\n*Completing the work by day’s end.*\n*Three years of service reviewed,*\n*Each fulfilling their duty.*\n*Difficult and cautious,*\n*Yet united in harmony.*\n*The gods now at rest,*\n*The people rejoicing.*\n*Revering this teaching,*\n*Trusting and obeying.*\n*O gods, bestow*\n*Your blessings upon our people.*\n*Heaven witnesses your virtue,*\n*Granting the title of True Man.*\n*Your images radiant,*\n*Ever-present in splendor.*\n*Your people offer sacrifices,*\n*Unceasing through ten thousand generations.*\n*Future gentlemen,*\n*Do not abandon this achievement.*\n*Carved upon these walls,*\n*To praise its beginnings.*\n\n**Record of the Restoration of Lingji Gong**\nIn the tenth month of the thirtieth year of the Zhiyuan era, in Min’s Jishanli, the scholar Zhang Jungui presented a written account of Lingji Wang’s temple, saying: “This is the gods’ own writing. The village has an ancient temple but no stele, its halls nearly in ruins.” In the fifth month, Shen Jianweng undertook its restoration, and Jungui, together with Zhou Tong and others, collaborated to bring it to completion. By the eighth month, the work was finished.\n\nThe gods manifested their power, bestowing an inscription to be carved in stone. They commanded Lin Digong Yannian of the village to transcribe it and entrusted me with inscribing the title. I dared not refuse and signed my name with reverence. In the twelfth month, they presented an ancient poem, saying: “This records the gods’ intent—why not inscribe it?” Though I had already assented, my brush had not yet found the time.\n\nThe following year, in the first month, they came in person to seek my promise and produced a poem bestowed by the gods—sixty-five verses in all. What connection have I to such literature, that the gods should urge me so earnestly? Once, the river god greeted Wang Bo, saying: “The Pavilion of Prince Teng is to have a preface—go and compose it.” At the time, the host had already prepared one with his son-in-law. Yet Wang Bo’s work emerged unexpectedly—was there not a destined hand for such writing?\n\nThereupon, I burned incense, struck my teeth together, and recited the record and poem several times. They bore no trace of mortal speech, and I exclaimed: “How extraordinary! To be wise, upright, and just is the essence of divinity; to awe with power and majesty is but its excess. This temple, since the Kaiyun era of Later Jin, has stood for ages. For years, the villagers have served with pure devotion—how could today’s events arise without cause?”\n\nScholar Zhang replied: “The gods’ writings extend beyond this record and poem. In former years, when their numinous light was still concealed, only fragments of words appeared. Now, their radiance shines forth, their compositions resplendent, engaging with people. Their intent guides—sometimes urging duty, sometimes leading to goodness, sometimes exhorting filial piety and reverence. When matters arise, they compose works like *Sealing the Well*, *Rhapsody on the Non-Divine*, *Biography of the Painter*, *Eulogy for the Mural*, *Chants of Liangfu*, and *Songs of the Unicorn*. There are prefaces, postscripts, memorials, debates, conduct, songs, odes, petitions—thousands of forms, each more marvelous than the last. Those who hear of it bring provisions and follow in admiration. If one approaches the gods with sincerity, they respond according to need. To knock and inquire is to receive—every word, every phrase, is literature.”\n\nThe Laurel Dragon and Elder Jian, ascending and descending at its side, never failed to seek its writings day and night, using affairs to invoke the text and the text to verify affairs. Their hands responded to their hearts as if by contract or bond, thus joining their strength in this to extol the divine mandate’s glory.\n\nI then composed and sighed: This writing may well approach perfection—heaven sends timely rain, mountains and rivers bring forth clouds, and desires arise in due course. That which opens must first attend to spirits and gods; those who receive omens before the imperial court’s proclamations are the pitch-pipes of divine illumination. Since the Tang, our dynasty has selected scholars through examinations, and those born in this age vie to make their names through writing. Among the gods of Shu, there is one named Zitong, who manifests numinous power in that region and exclusively governs examination success. When the writings of the Ninety-Four Transformations were first intoned, the scholars of Shu revered and cherished him as if serving their own parents. Whenever one rose through perilous examinations to high office, they dared not claim their own ability but instead called it the god’s gift. Thus, scholars from other regions everywhere enshrined and worshipped him. The incense and altars of Zitong soon spread throughout the land. No honorific title bestowed upon him surpassed his renown.\n\nToday’s Lingji is the former day’s Zitong. Zitong flourished in Shu, while Lingji flourishes in Min. The writings of the Ninety-Four Transformations may not surpass it; we shall see the god’s incense and altars spread across the land just as Zitong’s did—how could his blessings be confined to a single region? Yet this writing, like heaven and earth, has never for a day been extinguished. What is temporarily obscured must become clear; what is temporarily obstructed must flourish. Thus, the gods have means to manifest their auspiciousness.\n\nOnce the divine stele was erected, the local scholars rejoiced and celebrated. At that time, Magistrate Zhou Zhuangxi presented the inscription for the stele’s reverse, saying: The gods of mountains must descend before they are born; the gods of Shenshen must descend before they are born. Will the present lord be born, or will he be born as the lord? These words, as if someone had guided his hand and pried open his mouth, were spoken thus. As the land’s numinosity grows daily more manifest, outstanding figures will emerge in kind. In time, they will surely make their names through writing. The nation’s prosperity is not only cause for scholars to rejoice but even more so for the gods.\n\nThe god’s surname was Xu. In life, he was a man; in death, he became a god. His merit lay in the state, his virtue in the people. The origins of his renown and the sequence of his temple enfeoffments are all recorded in the god’s own accounts. Here, I merely outline the temple’s restoration, the descent of writings, and the stele’s erection.\n\nMagistrate Zhang further said: When the imperial plaque was first requested in the past, the god’s surname and given name were unknown. The elders divined among the surnames and drew “Xu,” then named him *Wang*—“Hope”—implying his virtue could match the Four Directions, making him worthy of ranked sacrifices. Now, the god himself says: I am Jiang Wang, named Zhi Zheng; my younger brother is Rao Wang, named Zhi E. Thus, names are rectified, and origins are known.\n\nI once read the *History of the Five Dynasties* and, upon reaching the hereditary house of Wu, sighed over the Qi King’s lineage. When he, along with Liu Wei and Tao Ya, assisted Yang Xingmi in rising in Huainan, they were heroes of their age. Yet once he gained power, he ruled with such dominance. Nevertheless, he honored the Yang clan’s orphans and served them as a subject—how starkly this differs from Zhang Wenbiao’s refusal to serve Zhou Baoquan! The cosmos is boundless, past events are but dust, yet he had two sons whose names have fragranced a hundred years and whose temples have been fed for ten thousand generations. Alas, the Qi King has not died after all.\n\nRecorded on the day *jiazi*, two days before the Lantern Festival.\n\n*Preface to the Perfected Lingji*\n\nThe god’s surname, given name, and native place are recorded in the *History of the Five Dynasties*. In the fourth year of the *kaiyun* era of the Jin, the Perfected One harmonized with the imperial numen and descended here in radiant splendor. Counting by the ancient calendar, over two thousand *jiazi* cycles have passed. In the second year of the *jiaxi* era, upon receiving the court’s decree, we examined the *Rites of Sacrifice* and found him worthy of inclusion in the sacrificial canon. On every Three Primordials, Eight Festivals, *jiazi*, *gengshen*, and Dipper-Descending days, those who have matters to bring before the god must fast, purify themselves, and offer vegetarian sacrifices, holding solely to the god. Hold fast and do not lose this, and you will unite with the god. To unite is to merge with nature itself.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor obtained it and ascended to the cloudy heavens. The Queen Mother of the West obtained it and sat in the Lesser Broadness. Now the spirit and soul of this god remain unclouded in their clarity, having obtained it to bestow upon Fuqiu Gong, Wangzi Qiao, Jin’s Sima Ziwei, Feng Dahe, and others, who roam the boundless heavens. Listen, yet no sound is heard—its sound is resplendent. Look, yet no name is seen—its name is lofty and luminous. The four seasons keep their proper order, the myriad things suffer no harm, and beneficent moisture is dispensed throughout heaven and earth. Who in later ages could ever fathom this?\n\nLong ago, Master Nanhua cited the words of the *Great Master*: \"Only when there is a Perfected One does there arise true knowledge.\" Recently, we reverently encountered the Thirty-Eighth Heavenly Master, who transmitted the *Great Simplicity’s Congealed Spirit*. The Broad Dao Perfected One, through the knowledge he possessed, ever regarded true knowledge as his teacher. Accordingly, a special memorial was submitted to the Celestial Capital, appointing Jiang Wang as the *Nine Heavens Golden Portal Radiant Dao Penetrating Virtue Great Immortal Manifest Numinous Universal Salvation Perfected One*, and his consort, Lady Xu, as the *Specially Appointed Harmonious Assisting Benevolent Immortal Consort*. Rao Wang was appointed as the *Nine Heavens Jade Portal Proclaiming Transformation Assisting Teaching High Immortal Illustrious Numinous Vast Salvation Perfected One*, and his consort, Lady Tao, as the *Specially Appointed Kindly Assisting Compassionate Immortal Consort*. Their illustrious renown blazes forth, leading the dragon’s way, so that the numinous powers in heaven may proclaim their mighty deeds.\n\nToday, in this era of Great Peace, no thing resists or defies; timely rain and sunshine respond in harmony. The villagers, scholars, and common folk all rejoice and leap for joy, facing north to dance, bow with clasped hands, and prostrate themselves, offering prayers for the emperor’s boundless longevity and the singular virtue of the god. May this record be inscribed for posterity upon metal and stone. A poem is appended to the account:\n\nObtaining the One, it becomes numinous—\nThis is called the god.\nThe god as god—\nYet able to refine essence.\nDim and obscure,\nWithout action, without form.\nPossessing nature and feeling,\nIt merges with the Dao in truth.\nProclaimed as Perfected One,\nHe soars to memorialize the Celestial Capital.\nHis singular merits and deeds—\nBroadcast upon metal and stone.\nGreat Immortal, High Immortal,\nAscending into the Nine Heavens.\nRain and sunshine never err—\nHe holds the power of creation.\nYour people, preserved and whole,\nRejoice and leap in exultation.\nHolding our sacrificial vessels,\nWho would dare not be reverent?\nThe god’s profound virtue—\nProclaimed in this ode.\nInscribed in stone forever,\nWhat is ten thousand times ten thousand years?\n\nComposed by Master Mingyuan of the Complete Teaching’s Mysterious Dharma, Daoist Registrar of Fuzhou Circuit, Liu Jingfu.\n\n*Record of the Divine Splendor of Aofeng*\n\nSouth of Min City, the great river flows from west to east, called the Gorge River, then the Ford River. Some twenty *li* farther, there stands a mountain called Aofeng. It commands the finest of the surrounding peaks and converges with the waters’ confluence, and there the temple is located. Beside it, dwellings cluster like stars or a chessboard’s pieces. The god abides where the people reside, and in due seasons they offer obeisance. With sacrificial animals, fruits, and grains, they partake of the land’s bounty. The people rely on the god’s blessings, so that young and old, livestock and crops, are free from the calamities of flood or drought, and live in peace.\n\nThis mutual dependence of god and people embodies the ultimate principle of yin and yang, a bond the world cannot sever. The two gods of Aofeng, traditionally surnamed Xu, were brothers of Li Zhigao of the Southern Tang. The elder, Zhizheng, was titled *Golden Portal Perfected One*. The younger, Zhikua, was titled *Jade Portal Perfected One*. It is said that in the Tang era, they led troops into Min, passing through Zhang to suppress rebels, and encamped at Aofeng, where they rendered meritorious service. Immortals appeared on Zhi Isle, and celestial lanterns and celestial music descended upon the site, so a temple was established there.\n\nAccording to history, Zhizheng was the fifth son of Li Wen’s younger brother and was enfeoffed as Jiang Wang, later changed to Wei. Zhikua was the sixth son of Li Wen’s younger brother and was enfeoffed as Rao Wang, later changed to Liang. The Min kings, Li Yan Zheng and Li Yan Xi, were at odds, and the kingdom grew increasingly disordered. The Tang dispatched their general, Cha Wen, to expel them, seizing victory to conquer the prefectures of Quan and Zhang.\n\nThe kingship is not recorded in the annals. Has the censor erred? Yet with Aofeng’s towering majesty and the mountains and rivers conjoined in harmony, it is fitting that spirits should reside here. The gods embrace the land, manifesting abundance and answering prayers—supplications as though met with direct response. Jade within the mountain moistens the trees; pearls in the deep lend radiance to the waters. Such is the principle, and how much more so when merit and virtue are born. That the villagers, upon their passing, should honor them with a shrine is but proper ritual.\n\nHanlin Academician and Court Attendant Gao Tingli of Changle, whose son Gao Xiong hastened to pray at the shrine, found the divine resonance so immediate it was as though he received instruction face-to-face. (He spoke of the ten celestial stems,) and in verifying these matters, not a single detail was amiss. By special edict, the divine splendor of Aofeng was painted to repay the gods’ favor. The emperor summoned his son to record these events, summarizing their essence to inform the villagers.\n\nComposed on the fifteenth day of the ninth month in the ninth year of the Xuande era by Wang Bao of Min, Hanlin Academician, Compiler of the Hanlin Academy, and Gentleman for Fostering Virtue of the Han Prince’s Household.\n\nPainted and inscribed by Hanlin Academician and Court Musician Gao Tingli of Changle.\n\n*Eulogies to the Divine*, Scroll One—end\n*Eulogies to the Divine*, Scroll Two\n\n**Memorial and Felicitations**\n\n**Memorial Congratulating the Perfected Lord on His Ennoblement**\n\nWe bow before the celestial script, where phoenix seals and dragon charters bestow names upon the virtuous and divine. Within cinnabar terraces and jade chambers, what fear is there of failing to attain immortality? Their wondrous works defy all reckoning, their reverence manifesting in every gesture of hand and foot.\n\nI, your humble servant, offer congratulations. Reverently considering the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Aid Perfected One—how upright and just, how keen of perception and wisdom! Silently upholding the benevolence of generation and transformation, they have mastered the profound and obscure Dao. Ever vigilant in awe, ever compassionate in love, they harbor the caution of one who guards against transgression. By their merit and by their person, they have fittingly received the grace of ennoblement, a cause for universal acclaim.\n\nAt this time of flourishing achievement, who would not rejoice as though discarding sandals in haste? Who would not aspire to offer congratulations as though holding the whip of service?\n\nI, your servant, a mere reed adrift, a blade of grass in humble existence, find solace only in submission. Gazing upon the sacred favor, I am overwhelmed by the source of such gracious words—how could a mere child fail to comprehend? In presenting this memorial, I inscribe my heart with humility.\n\nI humbly beseech Your August Majesty to deign to heed my plea and perceive the sincerity of this lowly one. May your radiance shine ever brighter, and may your blessings descend in abundance. In nurturing the people, your kindness is like rain and dew, suffusing all. How could my prayers compare? May your glory endure as long as heaven and earth.\n\n**Memorial Congratulating the Auspicious Dawn of the Golden Palace**\n\nWe bow before this missive, ascending through the ninefold heavens, bearing honor as the exalted magistrate of Nanchang. On the seventeenth day of the ninth month, joyously coinciding with the descent of the divine upon Mount Song, villages and communities rejoice as one, and the people all celebrate.\n\nReverently considering the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace Illuminating Dao and Manifesting Virtue Great Immortal, Manifestly Numinous and Universally Beneficent Perfected One—how upright and just, how vast their divine efficacy! They shine alongside sun and moon, partaking in the transformative nurturance of heaven and earth. With fifty-five vows, they pledged to deliver all beings.\n\nFour hundred years and more have seen deeds amassed and conduct refined.\nVirtue alone is their aid, and with the Dao they merge as one.\nBestowed upon the ten thousand things, all finds its rightful place;\nSet within the four seasons, all follows its proper order.\nAll receive blessings—who would dare forget such grace?\nWith the sincerity of tigers bowing, we reverently toast the longevity of the rhinoceros horn cup.\nWe further pray that the thousand and more households of the Village of Accumulated Goodness all find shelter beneath your vast protection.\nMay the Great Sage’s reign endure for a hundred million years, its foundations and plans everlasting.\nThis servant’s heart knows no limit to its longing and devotion.\n\nMoreover, we bow in awe as Mount Song, treasury of auspicious omens and wellspring of heroic talent, brings forth generals and ministers in a felicitous convergence of wind and cloud.\nAs luminous spirits, they aid the state and shelter the people—this auspicious dawn arrives in the ninth month, its achievements outshining those of the Five Dynasties.\nReverently considering the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace:\nDescended from King Yan, enfeoffed for generations in Qi, his temple has enjoyed five hundred years of grandeur, his honorific titles spanning thirty-two characters.\nDivine favor shines brightly, and extraordinary grace descends time and again.\nThis land of Ao Peak, so rich in geomantic excellence, has seen comets streak across the rainbow isles—thus we raise the rhinoceros horn cup in celebration and feast.\nReflecting on our humble station as stewards of the immortal register, we serve the numinous shrine.\nAll who dwell beneath heaven’s vast canopy receive its sheltering care.\nWith gratitude long felt, how shall we repay such blessings in this present hour?\nMorning incense and evening lamps ever gaze upon your radiance;\nDawn bells and dusk drums, though meager, strive to offer due reverence.\nWe do not shrink from the shame of our paltry offerings, hoping only that the divine might deign to descend.\nWe pray that the Sage on the throne may govern the Central Kingdom for ten thousand years;\nThat the divine power manifest its efficacy, its exalted honors enduring for a thousand ages.\nMay palace gates stand solemn and serene, and neighborhoods thrive in peace.\n\nNow, the **Memorial Congratulating the Auspicious Dawn of the Jade Palace**:\n\nWe observe how harmony reigns within the palace, solemnity within the temple.\nThe hundred spirits stand majestic, their voices resounding like rushing waters.\nTheir numinous presence has guided our sacrifices through many years, enabling this day of prosperity to arrive.\nThis servant, trembling with awe, bows his head again and again.\n\nWe have heard that the great are sagely, and the sagely are divine.\nSincerity takes form, and form becomes manifest.\nTheir coming knows no bounds, their going leaves no trace.\nSeen, they are invisible; heard, they are silent.\nYet in wisdom and uprightness, they move in accord with humanity.\nFrom near to far, from hidden depths to lofty heights, they know the nature of all things.\nHeaven and earth unite in their virtue; the four seasons follow their order.\nTheir fame resounds through the ages, their beneficence bestowed upon the people.\nEven for the mulberry and catalpa of one’s homeland, reverence is due—how much more for the sacred offerings of orchid and waterweed?\nReflecting on we, the ritual leaders, who dwell among our fellow villagers as humble scholars:\nWe rely upon the divine, who speak not of the benefits they confer.\nTimely rains and sunshine—even heaven does not defy them, let alone mortals.\nThe old find peace, the young contentment; the people to this day enjoy their bounty.\nScholars delight in court, farmers in the fields; artisans sing at their work, merchants in the marketplace.\nHow towering their achievements—how can we repay such virtue?\n\nThus we encounter this auspicious dawn, when the Jade Palace of the Nine Heavens’ Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Dao, the Illustrious and Vastly Beneficent Perfected One, flows with felicitous omens.\nThe season aligns with the Middle Prime, the moon with the festival of Zhongyuan.\nThis life may attain the longevity of heaven itself—let the recluse’s retirement wait another day, and the footsteps of King Kang follow eight dynasties hence.\nWith the mandate renewed, the people ascend to joy, and we celebrate Mount Song’s descent of the divine.\nOn this day of divine visitation, we join in the ancient rite of Hua’s threefold blessing, offering our sincerest prayers.\nThe osmanthus moon waxes full, its luster like jade gleaming in the eastern sun.\nThe immortals of Penglai never age, their radiance linked to the southern pole star.\nHow could we, witnessing this in person, fail to dance with reverence?\nWe pray that you may be at our left, at our right, above us—though unseen, you are ever present.\nGrant us wealth, grant us longevity, grant us prosperity, from this day forward.\n\nThis servant’s heart knows no limit to its longing and devotion.\n\nMoreover, we acknowledge that the sacred is beyond comprehension—this is what we call the divine.\nResponsive to devotion, it answers.\nThe people to this day enjoy its blessings—how could we ever forget?\nThis day of prosperity has arrived—we dare not invoke the mandate of the Supreme Emperor.\nThis servant, trembling with awe, bows his head again and again.\n\nWe have heard that the formless is the essence of the supreme Dao.\nThe Yellow Emperor unlocked its gates; the Most High Lord Lao transmitted its lamp and seal.\nVirtue without pretense, the marvels of emptiness and stillness—its boundless origin.\nThe profound beyond the profound, the vast and open—its wondrous workings in the ceaseless generation of life.\nIt courses through the six directions without pause, governing the ten thousand things without omission.\nHow towering its achievements—how can we ever name its majesty and power?\nReflecting on this servant’s aspiration to seek the Dao, yet lacking the talent of others:\nIn presenting these words, I offer the steps of my humble heart, praying that my reverent duty may not defy the august will of heaven, though it be but a foot’s distance away.\nAgain, we, the ritual leaders, have devoted ourselves to pacifying the divine, invoking blessings through the shrine’s numinous efficacy.\nIts fame resounds in illustrious titles, its glory proclaimed in resounding voices.\nHarmony reigns within the palace, solemnity within the temple.\nThough the mulberry and catalpa of our homeland command reverence, even the humble offerings of orchid and waterweed suffice.\nNow, on this morning of Zhongyuan’s gathering of blessings, we celebrate the birth of the Grand Minister.\nHeaven and earth bestow their auspices; neighborhoods resound with joy.\nThis month, at its midpoint, we sing of Mount Song’s birth in the year of Shen.\nMay his longevity match heaven’s, and our prayers for his long life join the ancient rite of Hua’s threefold blessing.\n\nThus we encounter the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, Supreme Lord of the Jade Palace:\nHe sets the model for the ten directions, establishes great deeds across a hundred million kalpas.\nNo distance is too remote for his illumination—all with blood and breath revere and serve him.\nWe lay bare our innermost thoughts in supplication.\nThis servant, a being of dust and impurity, serves with trepidation day and night.\nAshamed of my ignorance and dullness, how dare I claim intimacy with the Most High?\nYet with fasting, purification, and ablutions, I serve the Emperor.\nStanding in awe beneath heaven, we call upon the divine—wise, luminous, and upright.\nReverently holding office, we are fortunate to part the clouds and behold the sun, as one who treads thin ice over a deep abyss.\nWe pray that, though unseen, you may yet be present, ever guiding with your unseen way.\nGrant wealth and prosperity, grant venerable age, bestow these gifts upon the people.\n\nThis servant’s heart knows no limit to its longing and devotion as we gaze toward heaven and yearn for the sacred.\n\nTo the Supreme Primordial and Supreme Perfection Lords,\n\nAs the three yang energies usher in prosperity, so too does human endeavor commence. With reverence akin to standing before the two palaces, we trust that the celestial heart may yet be moved. We lay forth our humble wishes, praying for ever-greater abundance of vast blessings.\n\nThis servant, trembling with awe, bows his head in prostration. We reverently recall the Nine Heavens’ Two Perfected Lords, descendants of the Lord of Yan, enfeoffed in the land of Qi. Their mighty virtue matches the encompassing power of heaven and earth, and through it they succor the people, extending the blessings of rain and dew. Their divine efficacy is boundless, their uprightness impartial. For four hundred years, their temple sacrifices have endured; their celestial titles span sixteen characters. Who among those who have witnessed their grace would dare fail in reverence?\n\nWe humbly pray that you bestow your distant blessings, that we may sing the *rangrang* and *jianjian* odes. Preserve our descendants, that they may extol the *zhezhe* and *shengsheng* virtues.\n\n**Memorial of Prayer for Peace to the Supreme Perfection Lord**\n\nCold and heat assail us—such are the shallow schemes of petty men. Yet the noble, dwelling in peace, ever contemplate peril and act with foresight. Though we have long offered our prayers, we rely on unseen aid to sustain us.\n\nWith gratitude, we declare: Reverently considering the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Aid Perfected Lord, whose virtue matches heaven and earth, whose blessings flow like rain and dew, we behold the radiance of your manifest power and the boundless compassion of your salvific heart. We, your servants, dwell as common folk, gathered in humble abodes. Long sheltered beneath your celestial protection, we dare to turn our sunflower hearts toward you in sincerity. Yet we have failed in cultivation, unaware of our shame.\n\nMindful of the warning from the trembling neighbor, we value the virtue of aiding those nearby. Thus, in the peace of a shared well, we must guard against one who, falling in, would act only after the fact. To act with caution is to spare future sorrow.\n\nWe further pray that rain may fall upon our private fields, yielding abundance—plump grains, sturdy stalks. Bestow upon the people the blessings of longevity, wealth, and well-being.\n\nMoreover, spirits unworthy of sacrifice are those who fail to ward off disaster and repel calamity. Though heaven-sent afflictions may be averted, how dare we delay in observing fasts, upholding precepts, and serving with reverence and trembling awe? Gazing upward at your celestial virtue, we bow in gratitude for the imperial grace that moves the earth.\n\nWe, your servants, dwell as neighbors beneath the same trees and mulberries. Ashamed of our ignorance, like those confined to a well, we respectfully unite our community in supplication, for the people’s voice is heard. Once, we heard that even the excesses of one’s own faults could turn away divine wrath. Now, though we may seem as unlearned as children, how could the remedies of great ministers be exhausted? Or perhaps the calculations of the people of Pu have already taken root—some gluttonous as the ravenous Cao Ju, others haughty as Zi Chang. Who would dare claim faultlessness? Yet why not seek omens, that we may know whether fortune or misfortune awaits?\n\nTruly, we have long offered our prayers. If the numinous responds, if it arrives, is this not as it should be? We strive to act rightly, yet fear overstepping in speech. Failing to emulate Yao and Bin, we bear the guilt of falsehood. Heaven’s script and translated talismans are inscribed upon the altar. If omens are ominous, they are deemed portents. The divine brush, following the laws of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, ensures that baleful influences are expelled and falsehoods eradicated. We pray you do not indulge excess, lest it breed suffering—this is our wish, and may the spirits witness it.\n\nThus, we prostrate ourselves before the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace and Jade Palace Perfected Lords, who are sagely and divine, both civil and martial. When gathered, they manifest their radiant power; when dispersed, they extend their boundless compassion. For a thousand years, their sacrificial rites have been solemn; their sixteen-character titles are grand. Their might shakes the thunder’s wrath, reducing the Five Peaks to dust; their merit rivals the sun and moon, illuminating all directions. They drive pestilent spirits to the mountains’ left and establish defenses to the south of the Red River. The seas and lands are purified, villages and hamlets are at peace. Below, they relieve the suffering of all beings; above, they fulfill the Most High’s compassionate virtue of cherishing life. Though their grace pervades the people’s hearts—even the children who play in the fields—what need have they of imperial power?\n\nWe humbly pray that you dispel misfortune, ensuring enduring peace. May each safeguard their well-being, concealing faults and embracing flaws. May right and wrong alike be shielded. We dare not offer the meager gift of water celery, nor presume to speak of the debt repaid by binding grass.\n\n**Memorial from the Villagers to Preserve the Perfected Lord**\n\nWe have heard that merit is called the Dao, originating in the boundless beginning—profound and obscure, beyond knowledge or perception, beyond the reach of thought or calculation. Since the Supreme Perfection Sovereign inscribed the purple script, those who study the Dao have been able to trace its source and channel its flow, compiling sacred texts and rituals for the world’s ears and eyes.\n\nNow there is a spirit who takes the observance of fasts and precepts as merit, who vows to deliver the living and ferry the dead. His words align with the sacred canons. All who are talented and virtuous recite them, and their resonance may yet be verified.\n\nWe have closely observed the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace Perfected Lord Xu and the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palace Perfected Lord Xu, whose renown spans the world and whose merit resides among the people. Examining their conduct within and their deeds without, we find their very bones and appearance befitting immortals—men of sincere goodness, who have accumulated merit and deeply cherish the Three Treasures. If not for the fortunate convergence of past karma, who could attain such profound understanding of transformation?\n\nTheir works—the *Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts for Transformation*, the *Nine Hells Spirit Lamp Rites*, the *Three Realms Purification Rites*, and the *Horse Protection Rites*—all derive from the Most High’s mysterious words. Through careful inquiry and verification, they naturally form chapters. Their numinous verses and chants serve as bridges across the kalpas.\n\nWhat is called \"closing the door and riding the carriage\" disregards the passage of years. Beyond these, there are the *Numinous Aid Special Rites*, the *Original Vows Ritual Texts*, and the *Seven Luminaries Lamp Rites*—none of which were composed for personal merit, but rather at the people’s request.\n\nThis humble servant’s nature is crude and foolish, and my words are of little weight. Yet in examining affairs and assessing abilities, I recognize my duty. I humbly petition to refine and compile these works into a single collection, which has already been transcribed and presented. By the grace of the Sacred, this servant Xu and others have been appointed to office and elevated to the ranks of immortals. Now, I earnestly hope the Sacred Mercy will grant our request, allowing the ritual canons we have composed to circulate throughout the Three Realms. In every place they reach, let them be reverently followed and implemented. This will not only manifest the boundless salvific power of Numinous Aid but also strengthen our armies and console the hopes of the people in the southeast.\n\nI prostrate myself to await your decree.\n\n---\n*Eulogies of the Numinous* (Volume Two) concludes.\n*Eulogies of the Numinous* (Volume Three)\nPreface, Memorials, and Postscripts\n\n**Preface to the Ritual Forms of the Perfected Lords**\n\nI have long held that the Dao of Laozi is fully expounded in the *Five Thousand Words*, yet later scholars fail to grasp its entirety due to insufficient study. Only the transmission of the Han Celestial Master preserves its essence, and for over twelve hundred years, its renown has shone across the four directions. From high ministers to humble servants, all who seek longevity and well-being turn their hearts to it in reverence.\n\nNow, manifesting as divine, they are called the Numinous Aid Perfected Lords. Through their numinous vessel, they reveal their power—could this not stem from the lead-and-mercury method bestowed by the Celestial Master in a former life? A single point of pearl-light shines unceasingly. Every character and phrase they compose radiates with literary brilliance.\n\nAt first, I heard of this with astonishment, torn between belief and doubt. One day, I came bearing incense to gaze upon their shrine, where I beheld their steles and eulogies—words far beyond the mundane. Doubt gave way to conviction. Yet this book, a single volume, is guarded with utmost care by the local gentry, seldom shown to others. After long entreaty, I finally obtained it. Burning incense, I recited it several times. Its profound meanings are all drawn from the scriptures of the Most High, abstruse yet luminous, perfectly aligned with the Dao. The hidden hymns of the heavens resound in harmony. Their salvific power vows to embrace the seas and mountains. The divine mechanism is wondrous, now concealed, now revealed—how could shallow learning or limited wisdom presume to discuss it?\n\nYet while the divine is made manifest through the Perfected Lords, I have repeatedly wished to compose a preface or postscript, fearing that scholars might dismiss it as superfluous. As for the virtue of the Perfected Lords, it shines like the sun and moon; surely a sage will one day write their preface. I merely sketch its broad outlines here.\n\nWritten in the thirtieth year of the Zhengyuan era, by Ouyang Gongzhu, Assistant Instructor of the Lu Academy, on the eve of the Lantern Festival.\n\n---\n**Preface to the Vows of the Perfected Lords**\n\nThe vow is the vow of the Perfected Lords, and it is also the vow of all people. Each bow and prostration expresses the sincerity of the heart. Sincerity of heart is the perfection of goodness. The goodness inherent in human nature is like water flowing downward. To fail to correct one’s faults—this is my concern. This concern is why the vow exists: to cultivate goodness.\n\nIs this merely about the text of the vow? Gazing upward at the heavens, one finds the number twenty-five. Looking downward at the earth, one finds the number thirty. Combined, they yield fifty-five. It is through this number that the vow is fulfilled. If not for working in harmony with heaven and earth, how could this be achieved?\n\nGoodness is the guiding principle of heaven and earth. Even the slightest trace of deceit, arrogance, or negligence—this is not the vow I speak of. How could it be equated with true goodness? As the *Tradition* says: \"Goodness has no fixed master; it aligns with unity.\" There is no other way. Begin with it, end with it, and do not halt midway—only then is it perfectly good and perfectly beautiful.\n\nGoodness is the foundation of fortune, and fortune is the accumulation of goodness. Tang Gao Yu once said: \"Accumulate goodness to attain fortune; do not expend wealth to seek fortune.\" If fortune can be sought without expending wealth, can one who cultivates goodness be said to expend wealth? When you see goodness, share it; when you hear of goodness, proclaim it. All who share this aspiration should encourage one another, so that we may stand without shame before heaven and earth—and before the Perfected Lords. This, too, is the great vow of the Perfected Lords.\n\n---\n**Memorial for the Restoration of the Numinous Aid Palace**\n\nAccording to the *History of the Five Dynasties: House of Huainan*, Prince Qi of Xu had two sons, the Prince of Jiang and the Prince of Yu—now the Golden Palace and Jade Palace Perfected Lords. The Perfected Lords were always skilled in literary composition, their numinous responses swift and efficacious. The people of the southeast have relied on their protection, far beyond the aid of Cao Gui.\n\nIn the *gengyin* year of the Yongle era, a great drought struck, deeply troubling the regional officials. Only the Perfected Lords manifested their power by bringing timely rain, a singular demonstration of their efficacy. Officials and commoners alike agreed that the temple’s dilapidated state demanded restoration, to honor the divine grace of the Perfected Lords. I respectfully submit this brief memorial, knocking at the gates of the great, wielding my brush to invoke blessings.\n\nThey abandoned office to become immortals, their literary legacy illuminating the jade registers of heaven. They halted troops and quelled bandits, their incense and offerings securing the golden turtle for ten thousand years. The sweet pear tree evokes the memory of the Duke of Shao; the magic fungus flourishes in the ancestral courtyard. Raise high the gates, expand the halls—dimly resembling the embroidered peaks. Before the palace, reverence lingers as if the Perfected Lords were present, their majesty radiant.\n\nBeyond the brocade-clad city, clouds and mist curl lazily around the jade windows, where sun and moon pass in tranquility. Approaching the golden palace, wondrous omens gather, fostering the vitality of long life. Blessings and prosperity flow abundantly, as the virtuous lords of the realm flourish. They are the pillars of the great realm, the scales of far and near. Seeking fortune and avoiding misfortune, they consult the treasure scrolls and jade texts of heaven. Praising goodness and reproving evil, they traverse the world as golden brothers and jade kin.\n\nAmid the turning seasons, they ever hasten past the courtyard in reverence; frost and dew mourn the nearness of the immortal isles. At the celestial court, the favored ministers receive divine prescriptions, tasting the elixirs and remedies first. In the maritime lands, the people rejoice at timely rains, and withered seedlings ripen early.\n\nMoss traces reappear, creeping into the curtains with verdant hues, half-encroaching upon the paths of footsteps; the wind stirs the green tiles. With hands that mend the heavens, they reconstruct new eaves, while rain washes the crumbling walls to lay fresh foundations. Yet adhering to old customs, they fail to rouse the unyielding courage of former days—how then may they achieve the unparalleled feat? Were the mighty brush not ceaselessly to inscribe it, the towering palace walls would rise in but a moment.\n\nTo the left, the Bei Brook; to the right, the Lai River—beyond, the Purple Terrace lies but a footstep from the immortals’ source. Before, a jade table; behind, the soaring *feilong*—the literary brush thrusts high as the Oxherd and Weaver stars. When one man enjoys felicity, ten thousand states share in prosperity.\n\nRespectfully inscribed.\n\nComposed by Lin Hanmeng of Boling.\n\n*Two Postscripts by Immortal Xu Xianhao*\n\nWhen a noble man encounters an age governed by principle, he composes literature to advance his aspirations, thereby enacting the Dao—this is no mere fortune, but what is fitting. The world may indeed be ordered through wisdom and effort; those who aspire to the Dao and seek efficacy in their time through literature must align with the gates of the worthy. To embrace uncut jade at Mount Jing is not misfortune—it, too, is fitting.\n\nYet how can the numinous be deemed ordinary in the dim and fragrant obscurity? That literature should startle and move people—is this not strange? The *Collected Works of Immortal Xu Xianhao*—comprising records, eulogies, rhapsodies, and odes—forms a vast compendium. Its words, carefully weighed and never excessive, all offer critiques that challenge the age. Though the realms of the hidden and manifest are sundered, one cannot escape the burdens of convention, and thus confusion lingers.\n\nIn my humble view, the noble men of this land, though devoted to the Dao and living in an age of principle, find their Way fitting yet their aspirations thwarted. Thus, they borrow literature to lend their teachings a numinous aura. In the moment of wielding the brush, is there truly no exertion of force? Whether man or spirit, I dare not presume to know. Were it so, the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture* would have emerged solely from Fuxi and Yu the Great.\n\nTherefore, I refrain from binding these words to any doctrine and instead append them to the postscripts of the esteemed.\n\n---\n\nMoreover, spirits rely on men to take form, just as men rely on spirits to achieve completion. In the intercourse between man and spirit, every word and utterance is literature. Does literature embody the spirit, or does the spirit embody the man? The *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture* seem to border on the uncanny. Though Fuxi and Yu, those great sages, validated and trusted them, how could the dull-witted masses of later ages not doubt and perplex?\n\nReading these works through the lens of spirit-human exchange and examining their words, one finds that all align with the hearts of sages and worthies. Ritual, law, punishment, and governance are as clear as the palm of one’s hand—why then this urgent concern for the people’s welfare? Spirit or man, who could fail to doubt and perplex?\n\nThe notion that fish and dragons aid wind and rain is but a reflection of human sentiment. Thus, I say: sincerity illumines, though it resides in the numinous, its realization lies with man. If even a single matter remains unresolved or a single phrase unformed, though one might borrow another’s voice, I know not how it could suffice.\n\nIn the moment of wielding the brush, I cannot shirk my duty. Should the grand tones of *huangzhong* and *dalü* fall silent while earthen pots clamor, such a world would shame the spirits. The *Collected Works of Immortal Xu Xianhao*, being the literary corpus of the numinous, has already spread widely—how could I not treasure it as jade and preserve it?\n\n---\n\n*Inscribed Text for the Imperial Placard of the Upper Numinous Aid Palace*\n\nWe humbly observe: the Dragon’s Head soars, the Turtle Peak stands majestic. The red dust transforms into brocade, beautifully arraying the altar grounds; the azure cloth unfurls like a net, fulfilling prophetic omens. A cluster of human habitation gathers, convening for a thousand years. The temple halls stand solemn, their frescoes renewed, their scale magnificent.\n\nWe reverently recall the True Man of Numinous Aid, whose divine power is vast, whose integrity and wisdom shine. The incense fire thrives, and his deeds manifest miracles. Recently, his transforming brush has flourished with literary grace. Through these allegories, he exhorts with ritual and righteousness. The erection of steles and inscriptions has made his merits and virtues resplendent.\n\nOnce, he received the honor of an imperial placard; now, he is granted the grandeur of celestial investiture. His name is inscribed in the immortal registers, his rank listed among the celestial ranks. His commendations are extraordinary, his favor and glory profound.\n\nAt this time, we encounter the Grand Steward, an official of the fourth rank, whose blessings shelter the Three Mountains. Possessing the ability of the Duke of Zhou to serve ghosts and spirits, and the insight of Confucius to illuminate the rites of suburban and ancestral sacrifices, he has examined the sacrificial canons and bestowed a palace name.\n\nThe brush wields strokes vast as rafters, the characters loom large as pecks—transforming mountains and rivers, vying in splendor with sun and moon. Villages and hamlets gleam resplendent; scholars and common folk rejoice in delight.\n\nA poem declares:\n*By celestial decree, Lingji ascends as true immortal,*\n*Blessing our living souls, moved by both heavens.*\n*The inscribed plaque shines bright, its characters vast as pecks,*\n*The palace gates stand grand for ten thousand years.*\n\nWe humbly pray that after the golden placard is hung, customs shall flourish in purity, and villages thrive in loyalty and beauty. Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants shall share in its blessings; rain and sunshine, cold and heat shall align with the seasons. Year after year, harvests shall be bountiful; person after person, all shall know prosperity.\n\nWe further hope for the imperial bestowal of an eight-character edict plaque, its golden script ensuring the fragrant incense of worship shall endure for ten thousand years. Year upon year, we shall offer prayers for the Emperor’s longevity—*ten thousand years, ten thousand years, ten thousand myriad years!*\n\n**Imperial Edict Plaque for the Hall of Harmonious Kinship**\nWe humbly observe that the Hall of Harmonious Kinship, established to instruct in human ethics, bears a grand plaque with characters radiant in splendor. Now, customs return to purity, and for all ages, this shall be known as the village of accumulated goodness.\n\nWe reverently honor the True Lord Lingji, upright and wise. In the palace, harmony reigns; in the temple, solemnity prevails. Flanking him, attendants stand in awe; his glory resounds, his spirit shines bright. Eight characters proclaim his imperial investiture, a sacred trace enduring a thousand years. With these hands renewed, this hall is built. The people gaze upon it, their bearing reverent and weighty. From this day forth, customs grow pure; the hearts of filial piety and brotherly love arise naturally.\n\nWe humbly pray that after the plaque is hung, high and low shall live in harmony, the young shall know their place, and the old their order. Villages shall know peace, the elderly shall be at ease, and the young shall be cherished.\n\nA poem declares:\n*The heavenly principles of the Three Bonds and Five Constants*\n*Instruct the people in kinship, and this hall is built.*\n*If you, the people, serve thus in return,*\n*One day, your gates shall bear the banner of filial piety and brotherly love.*\n\n**Imperial Edict Plaque for the Hall of Joyous Feasting**\nWe humbly observe that the sacred temple gleams with divine radiance, its attendants standing in solemn array, its paintings freshly adorned. Guarding the eastern realm, it brings longevity and wealth; the Lord of Lu named it the Hall of Joyous Feasting.\n\nWe reverently honor the True Lord Lingji, whose temple stands in solemn harmony, whose spirit manifests in glory. The imperial edict plaque bears eight golden characters; the rear palace houses three thousand beauties. With wings and awe, he responds to every prayer, bestowing all blessings. Though the rites of sacrifice were few, auspicious dreams followed, and the wish for a son was granted. The gates stand grand, the plaque shines resplendent.\n\nWe humbly pray that after the plaque is hung, your descendants shall flourish, inheriting the virtue of the *Zhongsi*. May your posterity be everlasting, and the songs of joy and intoxication be sung.\n\nA poem declares:\n*The lofty peak of Ao stands tall, its divine essence released,*\n*Blue cloth forms a net—its signs are clear and true.*\n*At this moment, Confucius himself carried the child forth,*\n*And the august spirit descended, granting the wish at last.*\n\n**Memorial of Sincere Gratitude for Rain**\nThe villagers, Huang Yuan and others, deeply concerned that summer has brought no rain, seek to dispel the drought demon and avert disaster. The divine descends from the heavenly court.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves before the true immortal, bathing thrice in fragrant incense, offering prayers and supplications. On the eighteenth day of the fifth month, with sincere hearts, we reverently invited the Daoist assembly to beseech the gracious True Lord Lingji. Proceeding to the Dragon’s Gorge Pool at Ao Peak, we welcomed the sacred water. By noon, it was enshrined in the palace, and soon after, clouds gathered in the southwest. By the *wei* hour, rain fell. That night, the ritual altar was opened, and the rites were performed according to the canons. A grand purification offering was made to the Dragon King, and a hundred prostrations were offered in the *Chant of Heavenly Repentance*.\n\nThat night, sweet rain poured in abundance. By the twentieth day, heavy rains drenched the fields, filling the furrows to satisfaction. In profound gratitude, we extend our thanks. We have invited the assembled immortals to conduct another purification offering to the Dragon King, the Field Deities, and all spirits. We pray to the Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper, lighting lamps for the constellations, and perform the ritual at dawn to repay the True Lord.\n\nWe present humble offerings, completing the rites in full, and hold a purification feast to express our gratitude. We humbly pray for continued blessings—may sunshine and rain align with the great harmony of heaven and earth. May the harvests be as abundant as millet stacks and grain beams, bringing the auspicious fruition of all crops. We trust in the boundless virtue of the Ninefold Imperial Court, spreading prosperity to the eight directions. May the songs of joy resound like the *Striking the Earth* hymn, and may all things flourish in pairs. May the Sacred Lifespan equal that of heaven, enduring for ten thousand myriad years. May all living things thrive in harmony, and the realm know eternal peace and prosperity.\n\nThese words convey our deepest reverence, our hearts brimming with fervent devotion.\n\n*Thus concludes Volume Three of the* Hymns in Praise of the Divine.\n*Volume Four of the* Hymns in Praise of the Divine *begins.*\n\n**Poem to the Supreme Perfection**\n\n**By Zhao Di of Baihu**\n\nTo the south of Fangshan stands an ancient divine shrine, traditionally held to be the abode of the brothers Xu Zhiyu of the Five Dynasties, known as the Golden Portal and Jade Portal—Two Perfected Ones. These Perfected Ones, scions of divine luminaries, have passed nearly five centuries. Yet their spirits, still in heaven, have not forsaken our people: in times of drought or deluge, pestilence or plague, prayers to them are swiftly answered.\n\nThough I, Di, am unworthy, I wished to bow before their shrine and offer supplication. Thus, I composed these *Step-in-Void Hymns* in their honor.\n\n**I**\nThe Sage is a scion of divine luminaries,\nWhose spirit roams the Supreme Nethermost.\nCrimson tablets ascend through purple clouds,\nJade canopies link the azure vaults.\nTheir radiance knows no dusk nor dawn,\nIn purity and emptiness, how resplendent they gleam.\nAuspicious qi drifts from the Jade Grotto,\nRosy hues adorn the crimson forest’s edge.\nThis morning, they descend in solemn majesty,\nPhoenix banners trailing in ethereal grace.\nThey attend to us, the folk of this realm,\nDispelling our entanglements and strife.\n\n**II**\nHow lofty the jade palace,\nIts heights brushing the verdant peaks.\nA heroic aura, divine through a hundred generations,\nTheir numinous light gleams through the four seasons.\nDignified in bearing, ever august,\nThe temple’s visage commands reverence.\nIn the azure hall, incense smoke hangs cold,\nBeneath the white sun, the rafters chill with cloud.\nHow frail this mortal frame,\nHow may it reach such divine splendor?\n\n**III**\nHow gracefully the feathered canopy sways,\nAs sacred vapors descend from the cinnabar gates.\nThe faint strains of phoenix song drift,\nCool autumn breezes scatter through the grove.\nJade nectar flows in purple clouds,\nDivine auroras waft with crimson tablets.\nFeathered robes sink beyond the stars,\nCelestial music fades in empty air.\nThe Great Void, so vast and still,\nSwiftly they vanish into rosy mist.\nOnly the *Step-in-Void* hymn lingers,\nBeneath the moonlit peach blossoms.\n\n**IV**\nLike flowering branches of jade, entwined,\nBy imperial decree, they govern our land.\nWhen the yin winds arise,\nA refreshing breeze brings sacred rain.\nPestilence yields to their divine grace,\nFamine is averted by their numinous shield.\nIn the unseen workings of the loom,\nTheir providence shines bright and clear.\nHigh in the Supreme Nethermost Heaven,\nTheir radiance graces the Palace of Pure Emptiness.\nJade pendants adorn their rosy robes,\nFeathered canopies trace the clouded paths.\nColdly they ride the endless wind,\nAscending to pay homage at the Purple Mists.\n\n---\n\n**Twelve Hymns at the Lingji Palace**\n\n**By Yang Jingheng, Left Assistant Director of the Ministry of War**\n\nBy imperial command, the Perfected One Zhang of the Supreme Clarity performed the *Yanxi* Offering at Lingji Palace. I composed this to commemorate the auspicious gathering.\n\nThe rivers and mountains proclaim their numinous might as the grand fortune unfolds,\nFrom the Supreme Clarity descends the immortal guest, bearing incense.\nThe celestial altar’s rites commence beneath clouded banners,\nFeathered regalia hasten to the moonlit halls and return.\nThis blessed assembly delights in ascending the sacred precinct,\nThough weak currents may yet separate us from Penglai.\nI pray the wind may lend me a crane from the Jasper Terrace,\nTo soar and bestow boundless blessings across the nine realms.\n\n**By the Same Author**\n\nVerdant peaks soar to meet the Turtle Peak,\nThe Purple Palace’s heights chill the vast heavens.\nThe cinnabar crucible’s glow illumines a thousand peaks beneath the moon,\nThe Jade Terrace’s fragrance drifts on winds through a hundred flowers.\nTheir divine power blazes, revealing numinous favor,\nThe Emperor’s virtue, exalted, bestows titles upon them.\nIn what year was this palace granted?\nWhen the Perfected One was enfeoffed, he passed beyond the white clouds.\n\n**By Peng Shen of Gusu, Right Assistant Director**\n\nFlower-laden fragrant chariots harness purple simurghs,\nThe flute’s melody descends from the rainbowed clouds.\nThe stars of the nine heavens float above the mountain temple,\nThrough five watches, wind and thunder encircle the stone altar.\nImmortal fruits weigh down the branches—cinnabar lychees ripen,\nCool shade fills the courtyard where emerald wutong trees stand cold.\nTheir divine power, resplendent, brings manifold blessings,\nForever aiding the imperial realm to endure in eternal peace.\n\n**By Li Ye, Right Assistant Director**\n\nStealing a moment from official duties, I pay homage at the divine palace,\nWhere stone paths wind through misty streams.\nA pair of crows beyond the window cry in the white daylight,\nA profusion of blossoms along the steps unfurl in spring’s crimson.\nWielding the tally, they bear princely rank in this age,\nWarding off calamity, their martial deeds shall be recorded in time.\nThe numinous shrine bestows grace upon this land,\nIts glory shall endure, its offerings unceasing.\n\n**By Zhou Chang of Fengyang, Surveillance Commissioner**\n\nTwice a year I come to the immortal palace,\nPlanting apricot trees, my heart sincere in gratitude.\nWondrous medicines heal chronic ailments,\nSacred talismans revive the weary and infirm.\nAt the grotto’s mouth, flowers frame the quest for the true deer,\nOn the peak’s waist, rain obscures the dragon’s dharma discourse.\nInscribed steles proclaim the imperial robes and blood offerings,\nEnnobled with titles, the sacred grace soars high.\n\n**By Qian Shu of Shaoxing, Left Assistant Director**\n\nBriefly halting my warhorse, I ascend Ao Peak,\nBowing again, I recall the brothers’ merits.\nIn days past, they quelled strife with blades,\nFor a thousand years, their temple has known autumn and winter offerings.\nVerses composed in prayer bear wondrous efficacy,\nThe numinous aid of Lingji earns grand enfeoffment.\nTheir divine power, vast, shields the nation and shelters the people,\nTimely rains and sunshine bring blessings in due measure.\n\n**By Zeng Ji of Sanshan, Supervising Secretary of the Ministry of War**\n\nOnce I led the celestial troops across the Xiang River,\nA million fierce warriors surrendered at a glance.\nThe Golden Ao’s blood offerings were not in vain,\nThe Jade Portal’s cinnabar decrees came in pairs.\nSwords and pendants stood in solemn array, clouds swirling,\nPavilions and terraces rose in layered stone grandeur.\nTheir heroic names endure through past and present,\nAnd their mighty writings crown the seas and lands.\n\n**By Yang Ningyuan of Xiujiang, Vice Director of the Ministry of Revenue**\n\nMountains green and waters fair respond to the mysterious workings,\nHeaven bestowed worthy guardians to watch over the islets.\nFrom dawn to dusk, they discern fortune and misfortune,\nJudging right and wrong with the precision of a hair’s breadth.\nThe ancient shrine stands beyond the Three Mountains,\nIts numinous favor spreads, known across the four seas.\nThe royal scions, ethereal, entered the immortal registers,\nTheir fragrant legacy is truly rare in this world.\n\n**By Zhu Chun of Shanyin, Supervising Secretary of the Ministry of Justice**\n\nReverently bearing the jade tally, I traversed the southern lands of Min.\nPassing Ao Peak, I visited the Lingji Palace of vast grace, gazing and bowing.\nAs the rites concluded, the temple officials, leading three or five youths in feathered robes and crane cloaks,\nInvited me to the Chrysanthemum Pavilion.\nOver tea, in idle conversation, they requested a poem to mark my reverent visit.\nThus, I hastily composed a few verses to glimpse but a fraction of the sacred dynasty’s divine majesty.\nMay later scholars correct my humble offering—how fortunate that would be.\n\nReverently bearing the imperial tally to southern Min,\nI halted my carriage to pay homage to the Two Perfected Ones.\nThe temple’s halls rise a thousand fathoms in solemn grandeur,\nTheir brocade robes gleam anew through the four seasons.\nJasper steles record their deeds, descending from heaven,\nJade ornaments radiate light, illuminating the seashores.\n\nThe rites flourish in this prosperous age,\nMay they endure with the altars of state for ten thousand springs.\n\n**—Meng Shi of Pei County, Minister of the Ministry of Revenue**\n\nIn the mid-winter of the *renzi* year of Xuande (1432), I received the imperial command to oversee affairs in Fujian. Passing by Golden Ao Peak, I wished to pay homage at the newly radiant Lingji Palace. Truly, the Two Perfected Ones were both loyal and filial, their merits extending to the altars of state and their blessings bestowed upon the people. Moreover, they mastered the turning of transformative *qi*, greatly manifesting divine favor to protect the sacred person of the emperor. Thus, it is fitting to bestow upon them honorific titles and ensure their eternal veneration, that the divine protection may abide. All this stems from the supreme benevolence and profound love of the sagely Son of Heaven. That Heaven and Earth endure together is no mere coincidence.\n\nI bowed deeply and kowtowed, then composed this poem:\n\nOnce in the annals of history I saw heroes,\nBrothers of one heart who built great merit.\nIn life they together fulfilled filial piety,\nAnd in death, know they still offered loyalty.\nOn clear nights, propitious dreams confirm the illustrious age,\nWith rare elixirs from Red Stone, the emperor’s health is restored.\nThe temple’s majesty upholds solemn rites,\nAnd for a thousand ages, the people revere their lofty virtue.\n\n**—Yang Zheng of Jishui, Surveillance Commissioner**\n\nElder and younger brothers, side by side, preserved the great Perfected,\nIn life ennobled with royal titles, in death revered as gods.\nTheir distant transmissions of esoteric writs conveyed alchemical secrets,\nTheir extraordinary merits moved the imperial court.\nThe immortal register bestows grand honors,\nAt Ao Peak, the solemn rites renew in splendor.\nIncense clouds drift beyond the banyan’s shade,\nWhere sacrificial offerings endure year after year.\n\n**—Chai Shan, Eunuch Envoy to the Lands of Fusang and Others**\n\nCharged with command, I led troops to the frontiers,\nWhere distant lands above revere the One, and below fulfill their duties.\nI tarried in the Three Mountains,\nLong favored by the wondrous presence here.\nNow, with reverence, I hold the embroidered banners,\nExtolling the sacred titles,\nTo invoke blessings for the voyages to and from Huai and the seas.\nMay the gods deign to accept,\nAs rites are solemnly observed.\nIn this hallowed retreat, moved by the scene,\nI gathered my thoughts to praise the divine virtue.\nMay later readers find refinement in these words.\n\nSouthern Min abounds with wondrous peaks,\nWhere Dongting and Taihua mountains intertwine.\nWhere true dragons once concealed their sacred traces,\nFloating radiance and layered verdure fill the ridges.\nThe Perfected Ones, in mystery both hidden and manifest,\nSilently turn the celestial mechanisms to spread divine power.\nAbove, with elixirs they guard the emperor’s person,\nBelow, with vast grace they shelter the people’s hardships.\nI have heard how brothers, equally filial and reverent,\nExhausted their loyalty through five dynasties, surpassing all heroes.\nIn life, renowned ministers; in death, enshrined and venerated,\nTheir manifest blessings and wondrous deeds shall know no end.\nThe temple’s awe-inspiring majesty is unmatched in the world,\nAs it presides over the eight thousand *li* of Jiangnan.\nWhen the five-colored clouds disperse, the golden Ao is revealed,\nPouring forth the Dragon Spring’s pure waters.\n\nAt that time, entrusted with a mission to distant lands,\nI came here in utmost sincerity to offer this hymn of eternal spirit.\nI saw only the quiet birds conversing on the moss,\nAnd blossoms, slick with wind, filling the valleys.\nHave you not seen the purity of Wuling’s landscapes?\nAt Fan’s mouth, where rivers and mountains are most serene.\nTo glimpse such clarity—what cares might dissolve?\nHere, in this moment, all is vivid and near.\nEntering the immortals’ path beneath the embroidered banners,\nA single soaring peak welcomes them.\nCarriages and horses arrive from the empty sky at times,\nWhile jade pendants chime in the nine heavens as a pair.\nThe azure birds sing as the wind sighs in the sacred precincts,\nThis realm’s purity shall not come again.\nThough I offer my sincerest devotion, lacking even a cup of wine,\nI pray the incense smoke may never fade,\nAnd endure as long as Heaven and Earth.\n\n**—Guo Jingfu of Bai Lake, *Spending the Night at Lingji Palace***\n\nTogether we reach the Perfected Ones’ realm,\nIn the bamboo lodge beyond, the fast is pure.\nDreams return to the lone island’s moon,\nCold seeps into my robe like frost.\nThe night’s *qi* stirs the divine Ao,\nAutumn’s sounds carry the soaring auspicious crane.\nI rise and dress, sleepless once more,\nAs the ethereal mist reveals the celestial fragrance.\n\n**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *Ten Marvelous Peaks: Golden Ao Peak***\n\nThe golden Ao came from the sea,\nIts extraordinary beauty infused with numinous essence.\nIt seems a coiled azure dragon,\nSoaring amidst the radiant clouds.\nThe cassia halls float in cinnabar light,\nThe lingzhi chambers conceal immortal mysteries.\nAt times, I gaze upon the returning crane’s chariot,\nAs celestial fragrance suffuses the misty verdure.\n\n**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *Golden Ao Peak***\n\nA speck of gold floated up from the sea,\nForming a cinnabar cavern amid the clouded woods.\nThe gods claimed this land of concentrated numinosity,\nSpreading true *qi* through all ages.\n\n**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *White Deer Peak***\n\nWhite Deer Peak, its verdure piled like jade,\nThe deer followed the clouds, never to return.\nEven now, on the path by the stream’s scattered stones,\nI imagine their tracks lingering on the green moss.\n\n**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *White Deer Peak***\n\nThe immortal deer, bearing flowers, passed this way,\nOpening a Chan temple in the cliffs’ secluded nook.\nThe green mountains remain unchanged, their name enduring,\nEver inspiring the forest monks’ joyful verses.\n\n**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *Brush Peak***\n\nThis mountain soars into the azure void,\nThree divine peaks stand in sharp relief.\nFlying verdure cascades like a dragon’s pool,\nStill holding the inkstone’s waters.\nClouds welcome the returning brush formations,\nStars encircle the rising glow.\nMay the divine mechanism unfold,\nEver offering tribute to the enlightened ruler.\n\n**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *Brush Peak***\n\nIts dynamic force, solitary and towering, pierces the emerald haze,\nFrom afar, it seems to paint the mist and clouds.\nAfter the banished immortal’s dream ended in spring’s breeze,\nWho knows how many times the flowers have bloomed on its summit?\n\n**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *Lotus Peak***\n\nTo the south, Lotus Peak rises a myriad fathoms in autumn,\nThe pure depths of Jade Well float with auspicious light.\nI know that each night where the fragrance drifts,\nIt scatters into the twelve jade towers of the immortals.\n\n**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *Lotus Peak***\n\nThe Jade Well’s roots transplanted to the emerald ridges,\nStanding tall and solitary above the clouds.\nWhen the Perfected Ones gather the jade blossoms,\nIt all seems like the Jade Pool after the immortals’ feast.\n\n**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *Flying Peng Peak***\n\nBeyond the world’s Penglai, this peak,\nIts beauty and grandeur adorned with jade-like plants.\nIt flew forth from the Three Spirits,\nAmidst these ten marvels.\nHeaven opens the White Jade Pot,\nNight illuminates the cinnabar flames.\nIf immortals may be sought,\nI shall part the clouds to seek their hidden depths.\n\n**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *Flying Peng Peak***\n\nFrom the sea of islands, which peak flew here?\nAt its summit, the sunlit jade lotus stands sharp and clear.\n\n**Seeking the Dao’s Immortals**\n\nThe immortals’ guests delight in pure contemplation,\nAscending the cinnabar steps to trace the cranes’ tracks.\n\n**Greedy Wolf Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nIts radiance at the Dipper’s edge—unclimbable,\nYet in what year did it rise, verdant, to stand among men?\nOnce atop the golden turtle, gazing afar,\nIt still resembles Penglai—yet which mountain of that isle?\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nPeaks cluster on all sides like painted screens,\nTheir perilous heights soaring straight into the azure void.\nAt times, in the still night, a crimson glow blazes,\nA single radiant beam piercing the Dipper’s stars.\n\n**Square Rock Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nSquare Rock beside Kongtong,\nIts divine beauty fit to grasp.\nGazing, it seems a dark leopard crouched,\nIts reflection inverted in the limpid river’s jade.\nAbove dwells an elder who feeds on lingzhi,\nChanting long songs upon the mossy stones.\nYou, too, should brush the dust from your robes,\nAnd daily wander with the white clouds.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nIts summit, sheer as if cleaved by the sky,\nThe cranes’ path to immortality—spotless, without moss.\nThe celestial winds blow down the hanging cliff’s waterfall,\nScattering into midnight thunder upon the crags.\n\n**Purple Terrace Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nEmerald cliffs and cinnabar crags meet the lofty terrace,\nAs spring deepens, misty purple clouds amass.\nWho plays the jade flute beneath the terrace’s moon?\nIt must herald the return of the turtle-peak’s crane-borne chariot.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nPurple qi swirls, unbrushed and impenetrable,\nIts perilous base thrust forth, carved by heaven itself.\nThe jade pendants’ chime falls before the terrace’s moon—\nSurely immortals ride the cranes to descend.\n\n**Ancient City Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nHow many households remain in the ancient city?\nThe mountain stands empty, few traces of the past.\nMossy paths—no dust of fragrance,\nSmoky cliffs gather the cold’s hue.\nWind chimes through pines and cassia by the pool,\nMoonlight climbs the vines and rocks.\nDo not heed the crows’ night cries—\nThey stir memories of bygone days.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nEmerald cliffs and cinnabar crags—uneven the path,\nYet travelers still speak of the ancient city’s name.\nWind and spring daily deliver their clear, cool melody,\nUnaccompanied by the plum blossoms’ iron flute.\n\n**Great Peace Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nThe jade candle’s glow descends from the nine heavens,\nA thousand peaks and ten thousand valleys carry the cloud-borne song.\nWho joins in singing the *Great Peace*?\nBest to ascend the golden turtle’s hundred-foot bridge.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nThe scene of Great Peace—boundless and vast,\nHalf veiled among these famed mountains’ finest.\nGrateful that the spirits nest here in peace,\nShaded cliffs and trees bathed in the wind of benevolence.\n\n**Forty Poems from the *Eight Immortals’ Odes to the True Immortals***\n\n**Turtle-Peak Immortal Palace**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nDivine favor shines upon the immortal realm,\nHeavenly incense fills the embroidered robes.\nFlowers welcome the twin phoenixes,\nMountains embrace the golden turtle.\nOsmanthus gates rise to the clouds,\nLingzhi altars hang high beneath the moon.\nThe divine mechanism encompasses the cosmos,\nBrush and ink send forth waves and billows.\nJade caves face the morning herbs,\nJasper terraces—Queen Mother’s peaches.\nBehold the vaulted stele’s myriad characters,\nAncient imperial decrees bestow praise.\n\n**—Diaotai, Li Pu**\nAt dawn, the golden turtle’s summit,\nLofty and towering—thousands of *ren* high.\nSince the Two Modes divided,\nIt has not stood beside the Jun Peak.\nThe sagely court venerates the True Palace,\nIts splendor linked with the flower calyx’s radiance.\nThe divine mechanism reaches the nine heavens,\nAuspicious verses descend in double blessing.\nCloud forests conceal celestial fragrance,\nWind and springs mingle with immortal chimes.\nHow could one draw near this pure essence,\nTo wash away the dust of mortal nature?\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nJade halls rise from the central peak,\nThe golden turtle guards the distant earth.\nDivine light merges with the heavens,\nImperial favor arrives from the sun’s edge.\nCinnabar phoenixes tread upon jasper grasses,\nAzure youths present feathered cups.\nBeyond the dusty world’s bounds,\nIts auspicious qi surpasses Penglai.\n\n**—Qingmen, Shao Tong**\nTwin gates tower, far from worldly dust,\nEmpty fragrance and floating verdure—sunlit haze.\nPendants return beneath the moon’s distant glow on the golden turtle’s peak,\nMusic stirs the clouds, following the white cranes’ flock.\nBrush and ink bathe in the nine heavens’ new favor,\nRobes and crowns bear the Five Dynasties’ rare merit.\nGazing afar at the flower calyx’s radiant glow,\nA thousand years of divine light yield wondrous fragrance.\n\n**—Changle, Chen Tang**\nJade palaces mark the finest scenes,\nThe turtle’s back—stone firm and steadfast.\nIn times of peace, the divine and numinous manifest,\nMountains encircle it, its qi majestic and high.\nNight’s glow rises from the shell-gate,\nSpring’s hues intoxicate the immortals’ peaches.\nPeerless since ancient times, talents surpass,\nHonored with seals and bathed in imperial favor.\n\n**Dragon Pool Flying Waterfall**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nRain gathers over the immortal’s summit,\nFlying torrents bear the ancient pool’s waters.\nAt night, the twin streams’ descent is heard,\nBy dawn, they merge into a single brook.\nReflections invert the Silver River at dusk,\nVoices hang in the azure sky of autumn.\nHigh-dwelling cranes startle from their dreams,\nMysterious rainbows rise from hidden depths.\nDistant echoes—sparse bell tones,\nOne might mistake them for drifting white silk.\nAt Turtle Peak’s clear listening post,\nThe moon lingers in the *Step-in-Void* tower.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nThe numinous pool, drenched by night’s rain,\nThe flying waterfall pours from the bright river.\nClearing skies polish the ice-like mirror,\nCold sounds emerge from the creeping fig.\nScattered pines startle the cranes’ dreams,\nWinding shores carry the fishermen’s songs.\nBeware the moon at the stream’s edge—\nHow many times have true immortals passed here?\n\n**—Diaotai, Li Pu**\nBehold the Six Harmonies’ transformative work—\nCarved by heaven’s craft, winding and vast.\nThe hibernating spirit’s qi,\nThe pool’s secrets,\nThe Primordial’s Silver River descends from the sky’s edge.\nA thousand-foot rainbow hangs inverted,\nAbove, it joins the Milky Way,\nBelow, it flows into the river’s course.\nCool shadows, beauty,\nNew moon’s chill,\nVoices echo in the sparse wind—true immortals.\nAt dawn, they offer libations and sing pure odes,\nWho could share in this?\n\n**—Qingmen, Shao Tong**\nAfter the fresh rain, the numinous pool’s leisurely mood abounds,\nA hundred-foot flying torrent spills from the celestial river.\nSoaring through clouds, it seems to trail jade silk,\nBeneath the moon, one might mistake it for scattered jade pendants.\nSuddenly, it stirs the depths of the hidden pool’s listening,\nThen startles the wild geese flying past the sun’s edge.\nAt dawn, ascending the golden turtle to gaze,\nIt scatters into Penglai’s jade-green sea waves.\n\n**—Changle, Chen Tang**\nA thousand-foot cold torrent descends the cloud ladder,\nAs if the jasper vault exhales a white rainbow.\n\nMarvelous words meander, spreading sacred grace,\nWashing the world of mortals clean of mundane filth.\n\n**Bamboo Cliff After Snow** — *Baihu, Guo Yi*\nTen thousand stalks ascend sheer cliffs,\nSix-petaled blooms gleam on thawing ice.\nTheir hue borrows the luster of Wu salt,\nTheir light slants like Jiang’s winding path.\nFit for soaring auspicious cranes,\nOr the serene silence of spirit crows.\nBeyond the red dust’s fragrance,\nA thousand fathoms of jade-green plumes enfold.\nThe people of Ying sing of white snow,\nThe immortal’s furnace chills cinnabar.\nYet near the lofty perfected realm,\nPure fragrance rises like the *ditihua*.\n\n**—Diaotai, Ji Pu**\nDimly, the true ones nest in hidden crags,\nWhere piled snow seals deep seclusion.\nFrost-bound bamboo stays unopened,\nA thousand groves lose their verdant hue.\nSunlight congeals in pristine splendor,\nThe first day of winter startles with a cold gust.\nSix-petaled flakes rejoice in shared clouds,\nTheir color heralds a year of abundance.\nThe immortals’ twelve towers,\nFace each other in jasper and jade.\nA single *buxu* hymn,\nRings crisp as shattering jade.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nBefore the cliff, clouds begin to gather,\nBeyond the bamboo, snow first dries.\nDawn’s distant terrace gleams,\nLow mist chills emerald sleeves.\nLuminous as mica curtains,\nScattered like crystal platters.\nDeeply ashamed of my meager dust-bound ties,\nI alone find it hard to harmonize with the immortal’s song.\n\n**—Qingmen, Shao Tong**\nPeaks congeal in crystalline green, brushing cloud-tips,\nSix-petaled flying blossoms still damp.\nWhere white cranes roost, all is indistinguishable,\nYet where the azure simurgh hides, they appear the same.\nThe *Liang Garden* rhapsody—how could one ever match it?\nThe *Ying* songs’ lofty art—who dares to join?\nI imagine the perfected pair returning at dawn with pendants,\nHeaven’s wind mingling with the chill of jade chimes.\n\n**—Changle, Chen Tang**\nBamboo leans on the numinous cliff, sublime,\nThe cold’s might, the auspicious snow’s clarity.\nCranes and simurghs circle endlessly,\nSprings and stones retain their purity.\nDreams drift to distant Three Xiang,\nSpirit wanders where myriad jades pour.\nThe hermit cherishes the *chaixiao*’s laughter,\nYet the path is too slick to tread.\n\n**Immortal Isle’s Sacred Fungus** — *Baihu, Guo Yi*\nOne peak gathers auspicious mist,\nA hundred plants yield to the spirit’s power.\nLeaves scatter dew from golden stalks,\nFragrance congeals from the Purple Palace’s stars.\nLike the Han Pond’s clamor,\nOr the Shang Valley’s verdant self-sufficiency.\nHow could it compare to the three flowers’ splendor?\nIt bears the nine fields’ fragrance as well.\nFloating light ascends the moonlit hall,\nPiled jade-green unfolds the cloud-screen.\nWould it permit a mountain dweller to pluck it,\nTo extend the lifespan of grasses and trees?\n\n**—Diaotai, Li Pu**\nLong ago, the true palace first stood here,\nWhere the auspicious herb took root.\nNine stems gleam with radiant vitality,\nThree blooms weave dewdrop blossoms.\nPrimal *qi* nurtures perfect harmony,\nThe spirit-root is rarely met in this world.\nLush and splendid, it displays its felicity,\nResplendent as a jade immortal isle.\nNot yielding to the Han Pond’s growth,\nNor inferior to the Shang Mountain’s greens.\nHow many years has its trace endured?\nTo this day, it spreads its fragrant (ten-word line).\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nThe immortal peak soars above the crowd,\nThe sacred fungus surpasses all fragrance.\nIts auspiciousness rivals the Shang Valley’s splendor,\nIts purity outshines the Han land’s scent.\nCloud-leaves in spring congeal in purple,\nGolden blossoms at dawn bear yellow.\nWould it deign to be plucked by the dust-bound world?\nFrom this, it scorns the fat of the rich.\n\n**—Qingmen, Shao Tong**\nFar Penglai, on the azure sea’s edge,\nThe world tells of this place where sacred fungus grows.\nFloating light at night falls into cinnabar wells,\nScooped jade-green at dawn brims the Taiyi Pool.\nThe turtle’s crown bears autumn dew’s lingering fragrance,\nThe Shang crag’s songs end as the evening sun lingers.\nHow could one bear to part with such true secrets?\nBetter to ascend the Heavenly Altar and ask a master.\n\n**—Changle, Chen Tang**\nThe land yields sacred fungus with purple leaves abundant,\nImmortals pluck its blossoms to obtain deep roots.\nI shamefully grow old beneath Yingzhou’s shores,\nHow could I ever join the Four Hoary Ones’ esteemed rank?\n\n**Returning Tide at Green Marsh** — *Baihu, Guo Yi*\nDistant islets, green riverbank trees,\nThe returning tide, the white sea gate.\nFull of feeling, it circles Wu Isle,\nUnwilling to part, seen at dawn and dusk.\nCold dips the cinnabar clouds’ reflection,\nChill shares the moon’s jade soul.\nA thousand homes flow with ancient grace,\nA single current from the immortal’s source.\nGazing to the limit, it coils like white silk,\nChanting done, half the (ten-word line) falls.\nIf the dusty tassels could be rinsed,\nI would ascend the turtle’s crown to pay homage to vast favor.\n\n**—Diaotai, Li Pu**\nAt Green Marsh, the tide first ebbs,\nEvening rain arrives on the river.\nWave-light pure as if washed,\nTen thousand acres without a speck of dust.\nStone roots thick with reeds and rushes,\nSandbanks where wild ducks and egrets guess.\nBoats moored on both banks’ narrows,\nThe path turns where clustered peaks open.\nDredged not by Yu’s hand,\nTributary waters return eastward on their own.\nThe Canglang’s fisherman sings,\nMoonlit nights encircle the immortal’s terrace.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nGreen Marsh, a place for wandering chants,\nVast and overflowing, the early tide returns.\nBoats lie where fragrant grasses bend,\nSand meets the distant great river.\nCurving banks, empty pools, and Wu Isle,\nA perilous rainbow hangs from the stone bridge.\nFrom here, the immortal’s path reaches,\nHow many times has one sailed the layered clouds?\n\n**—Qingmen, Shao Tong**\nDistant islets, vast and hazy, the sun not yet dim,\nThe returning tide, a single band, seems to know its source.\nIn clear light, white egrets leave traces on the sand,\nAt dusk, green moss is washed clean, revealing stone marks.\nSuddenly entering the limpid river, it still keeps faith,\nYet dividing the blue sea, all words fail.\nWatching the waves, I ascend the turtle peak’s summit,\nWhere does the tributary flow that is Yu’s gate?\n\n**—Changle, Chen Tang**\nA traveler nears Green Marsh,\nClouds guide the receding tide far off.\nStrange trees hang over the embankment,\nLeisurely gulls stand on shallow sand.\nNets gather, the many fishermen done,\nSails drop, a single boat tilts.\nWaiting to see the tide fill

      "translated_text": "**Stele Inscription for the Temple of the Divine Aid Kings**\n\nThe renowned county of the Fu Prefecture is Min; the esteemed village of Min is Jishan. The Temple of the Divine Aid Kings stands as the revered sanctuary of the region, its sheltering canopy and blessings sought by all. In its early years, those who sought fortune and entreated the divine often resorted to spirit-writing with planchettes, inscribing couplets or cryptic verses. Though the miracles and proofs of efficacy remain vivid in memory, no written records were then preserved.\n\nLater, villagers gathered beneath the temple’s eaves to pray, gazing upon its dilapidated halls—roofs sagging, beams rotting, murals dimmed—and said to one another: *\"Can this truly convey our reverence or secure the spirits’ favor?\"* They resolved to restore it, divining the gods’ will through the planchette. Thus, the divine responded with resounding clarity, revealing texts to guide the work. Once the labor was complete, the gods spoke again, their words—every phrase and utterance—now rendered in writing. From then on, long compositions and brief verses emerged in profusion, their brilliance dazzling the eye, their fluency loosening the scribe’s wrist. The gods’ writings surged forth like a boundless flood, their influence spreading to neighboring towns and villages, where people copied them with awe, transcribing, annotating, debating, and marveling. Could such words ever spring from mortal lips?\n\nIt is said that when the imperial plaque was first petitioned, the gods’ surnames and given names were unknown. Elders, drawing on ancient lore, settled on the surname *Xu*. Though the surname was thus established, the finer details of their lineage and titles remained obscure. Now, however, the origins of their illustrious legacy and the abundance of their miraculous deeds are fully revealed. The gods are one in essence, not withholding their favor in the past. After years of entreaty, they now manifest thus, startling even the most discerning. Perhaps this flourishing of texts presages the gods’ intent to herald their blessings and unveil their power—or perhaps their transformative will acts with purpose. Ah! Those who would fathom the gods’ hearts must understand: like torrents surging against the current, their roar is deafening, yet the silent flow at midstream is mightier still. In revealing their words to humanity, the gods act not by choice but by necessity.\n\nIn the Three Dynasties, there were no \"men of letters\"; the Six Classics contain no \"rules of composition.\" The sagely and wise who left writings for posterity did not craft them for ostentation. The subtleties of ruler-minister relations compelled Confucius to write the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. The fading of benevolence and righteousness moved Mencius to compose his seven chapters. Had the Kingly Way prevailed, the works of the magistrate of Lanling might never have been written. Had rites and music been restored, poetry would not have perished, and Master Wen might have played his zither by the Fen River—what need would there have been for transformation? Yet if the transmission to later generations does not rely on texts, on what else could it depend?\n\nThe gods’ intent aligns with that of the sages and worthies. They grant steles to reveal their deeds, divination slips to foretell fortune and misfortune. When mountains and rivers fade into obscurity, they compose texts to reclaim them. When customs grow base and corrupt, they write *The Ballad of Liangfu* to satirize them. As reverence wanes and the scholar’s spirit decays, they pen *The Last Poem* and *The Rhapsody Against the Gods* to admonish. Even *The Song of the Unicorn* and self-defense essays, along with poems of shifting forms—elegant, upright, strange, and rugged—abound in myriad styles, like a cascade of radiant verses or the harmonious utility of grain, cloth, and silk. Such is the nature of their writings—how could it be mere chapters, lines, and punctuation?\n\nIf the people of this village recite the gods’ texts and reflect upon their intent, the entire community will be steeped in Dao and virtue. In every hamlet of ten households, loyalty and trust will flourish. Whether tilling the fields, plying trades, engaging in commerce, laboring, or resolving disputes—whether through courtesy, deference, litigation, friendship, or leisure—they will honor the fundamental. At such a time, they may wander in the realm of the sages and ascend to the unfathomable heavens. Why, then, should the gods’ writings be confined to temple inscriptions? The reverse side of the stele reads: *\"Though I have imitated even a fraction of Master Liu’s skill, without Master Wen to record it, how can I instruct future generations?\"*\n\nYet in Han Yu’s records, beyond filial piety toward parents, wifely obedience to husbands, and the virtues of kindness, brotherly love, and fraternal duty, there is little superfluous language. The gods’ bequest to later generations through Master Wen was nothing more than a devotion to upholding the world’s teachings. Alas! My talents are meager—how dare I aspire to even a fraction of Master Wen’s brilliance? Like a turtle’s eye or a cicada’s wing, I dare not chirp beneath the thunder. Yet I recall that since the Later Jin’s Kaiyun era, the gods have dwelled in Min. My ancestors, too, migrated from Gushi to Min during the Five Dynasties. Over generations, some developed the land to build the gods’ temple, while others petitioned the court to honor their divine titles. The worship of these gods has endured for years. Now, the villagers, united in purpose, have contributed to its restoration, hoping for the gods’ boundless protection. How could I remain silent?\n\nAs for the gods’ surnames, their generational names, their illustrious deeds, and the miracles they have wrought—along with the temple’s founding and renovations—these are all detailed in the gods’ own inscriptions. A mere scribe like myself has no place to interject. My purpose here is merely to elucidate the gods’ intent in composing these texts: that the people of this land, nourished by its mulberries and hemp, may cherish its harmonious melodies. If all cultivate Dao and virtue, returning to loyalty and trust, then even the simplest offerings—jade-like wine in a worm-eaten ladle, minced pork and tender chicken, or river weeds and stream water—will suffice to answer the gods’ hearts.\n\nWithout teachings, the gods’ grace and humanity’s blessings would be limitless, cycling endlessly without cease.",

Thus shall we witness the celestial favor of ennobling titles bestowed, the gods’ glory resplendent in full display. (On the tenth day of the first lunar month), purple mists swirl and azure clouds rise, golden cups overflow with peppered wine—such is the height of human splendor. At such a time, there must surely be a brush as grand as a rafter to record these events. I shall await with keen eyes, lest Master Wen alone claim the beauty of Magistrate Liu’s legacy.\n\nMoreover, south of the Min River and beyond the Yangtze Gorges, a towering mountain rises—Mount Aofeng. To its south lies the Divine Aid Immortal Palace. Long ago, the humble shrine’s hidden traces became manifest; the state drew upon its merit, the people relied on its protection. Honors were bestowed, titles conferred, and rites observed with reverence—even to this day, how flourishing! Yet over the years, the temple’s beams and rafters have decayed beyond repair, its vermilion and azure hues fading into obscurity.\n\nOne day, villagers came to the shrine to divine their tasks. Seeing its state, they said to one another: “This is no way to honor the devout or soothe the spirits. Let us restore and renew it, each contributing our utmost.” The gods rejoiced in their earnest resolve and, before descending to compose a text, sought to encourage them. Thus, they pooled their sincerity, gathered funds, and commanded craftsmen to measure materials. Each shouldered their duties without delay: narrow gates were widened, dry ponds replenished.",

Their majestic presence blazed forth, their virtue shone resplendent. All who saw or heard were filled with reverence. Joyful in their offerings, the work was completed—it was the eighth month of autumn.\n\nYet the merit was not their own; they ascribed it to the gods’ favor. Rising at dawn, they prepared offerings and announced the completion, seeking to soothe and honor the divine with due ceremony. They extolled the gods’ power, recounting their deeds across three dynasties, from the Five Dynasties onward, and the blessings bestowed upon the illustrious Empress Dowager. Those who now receive offerings in this temple are remembered in both summary and detail, and thus this record is made.\n\nThe assembled workers were struck with awe, their gazes filled with reverence, their voices murmuring in wonder. The scribe then said: “Before, when we petitioned for the inscribed plaque, the divined surname was Xu. It was as if hidden in the sacred, unknowable. Now we learn it descends from the lineage of King Yan—truly verified! Let us carve this in stone, illuminating the unseen and preserving it for eternity.”\n\nThereafter, literary compositions emerged in layers, the *Yi* hexagrams bore slips for divining fortune, the *Ode of Liangfu* served as exhortation. Was it the gods who composed these? They revealed the obscure and boundless. The sealing of wells had its rules, the avoidance of taboos its prohibitions. Be it odes, rhapsodies, disputations, petitions, melodies, or gāthās—thousands of forms, myriad styles, ever more wondrous. Like cliffs suspended in empty space, towering and sheer. Like waves in a raging storm, surging and roaring.\n\nAh, what writing is this! For writing is the essence of celestial patterns in the heavens, the treasure of charts and texts on earth, the auspicious sign of courtly refinement in humanity. Yet the gods—elusive in the indistinct, dwelling in the unfathomable, unseen in shadow, unheard in echo—now manifest through writing. Why? Their wisdom is pure and upright, their majesty severe. Their numinous power and radiant might soar high. Though unseen, they see all; though unheard, they hear all. Emerging from Qian, entering Kun, spanning past and present. Discerning the future, revealing the past, making the subtle manifest and the hidden clear. Thus they unleash celestial essence, split open earthly treasures, and bring forth the literary auspices of humanity. The gods’ virtue has not waned with heaven. The earth does not withhold its patterns, allowing humanity to unfold this culture.\n\nThe gods wander the realm of the scentless and soundless—this is fitting. Yet to entrust this not to humans but to the gods—how remarkable! The essence of Ao Peak, the brilliance of Dragon’s Head, must give rise to extraordinary figures. May the gods continue to favor this culture! Otherwise, why would such auspicious signs appear?\n\nThe gods’ prose declares: “What I create must serve as proof for future ages, a stepping stone for advancement.”\nThe gods’ poetry says:\n*“Is writing not precious?*\n*The noble one’s glory endures like the leopard’s splendor.”*\n\nWas this my intent? The cycles of creation turn endlessly, nothing departs without return. To make the divine manifest—this lies with humanity.\n\nIts verses read:\n*“Ao Peak winds sinuously,*\n*The Palace of Numinous Aid stands.”*",

Thus, they pooled their sincerity, gathered funds, and commanded craftsmen to measure materials. Each shouldered their duties without delay: narrow gates were widened, dry ponds replenished.",

What the gods rely upon are humans. On this propitious day of early brightness, the gods manifest their numinous power, their resplendent writings entrusted to those of shared purpose. With reverent awe and vigilance, day and night, they dare not grow remiss. Thus, they adorn the sacred images, commanding the stewards of vestments to prepare the robes. Once completed, the gods themselves compose their own chronicles, inscribing them upon the stele.\n\nHow vast and majestic! How solemn and awe-inspiring—such words could not be uttered by common speech.

This will also benefit the people—is it not fitting?\"\n\nThey agreed: \"It shall be done.\"\n\nThe gods of the Eastern and Western Academies, long obscured by dust, have been neglected, for the age now favors martial pursuits. Some wish to remove them to make way for military plans. Yet those of shared purpose recall Confucius’ words: *\"Culture must be accompanied by martial readiness, and martial strength by cultural preparedness.\"* Civil governance and military achievement support one another—this is an unchanging principle through a hundred generations. How could it be abandoned? Thus, above, they honor the shrines of the Three Stars of Fortune and Prosperity; below, they enshrine the images of those who assist the state and pacify the people.

      "translated_text": "The villagers, gripped by great fear, could not endure even a single day’s delay. Once more, they conferred with their colleagues and beseeched the gods, saying: “We have long been engaged in this work, wishing to cease yet unable to rest. Our intent is clear—may the gods comprehend it.” The gods responded in writing: “To restore the temple is difficult, yet we follow where duty leads. How could we fail to grasp your meaning?”\n\nThereupon, they renewed all that was decayed and blackened—rafters and beams, broken and missing roof tiles, uneven and crumbling walls—each made anew. At that time, the gods bestowed a second inscription, naming the storehouses: to the east, “Harmony of Kinship,” and to the west, “Feast of Joy.” Thus, those of humble station might find expression, and their virtues be arrayed in full splendor—abundant, flourishing, and complete in every excellence. Though this was the fruit of their collective effort, it was the gods’ divine power that brought it to pass.\n\nAs the work neared completion, they petitioned Zhang Gongduo, the regional administrator, to bestow an inscription. The temple was then elevated in rank, called a *gong*. The strokes of the brush and the characters’ bold forms dazzled the eye. All who passed by—carriages and crowds filling the roads for days—marveled in admiration, their reverence deepening.\n\nThe stele on the eastern street was the gods’ own composition; the inscription on the western steps, the people’s praise of their virtues. The gods’ literary works, displayed throughout the temple, included steles, records, plaques, eulogies, essays, rhapsodies, memorials, petitions, debates, discussions, prefaces, odes, poems, songs, conduct, and discourses. Their collected works, circulated in the world, shone with brilliance, worthy of recounting.\n\nThe honorific titles bestowed upon Lingji, the ennoblement of the True Man of former dynasties, the proclamation of celestial favor—his virtue resplendent, his renown enduring through the ages. This is what the white-haired elders and humble village officials long to extol, beyond the mere words of the local people.\n\nAfter seven days, they returned with their colleagues, solemnly offering sacrificial animals and wine to perform the rite of completion. Taking their places in the courtyard, they reflected with awe. Three years of diligent service had passed—surely the gods, mindful of their merit, would bless them, granting the villagers shared fortune and ensuring their descendants’ reverence for generations. How could they forget its origin?\n\nNow, they wished to carve this account in stone, yet feared critics might accuse them of monopolizing praise. Thus, they first recorded the date at Lingji Gong, then inscribed this inscription:\n\n*Appointed from the Nine Heavens,*\n*Fearing the divine below.*\n*The gods’ brush stirs awe,*\n*Its might unstoppable.*\n*Adorned in robes and splendor,*\n*As the body’s glory.*\n*“Harmony of Kinship,” “Feast of Joy,”*\n*Names for the halls.*\n*Laborers and craftsmen summoned,*\n*The temple made new.*\n*From all directions they gathered,*\n*Completing the work by day’s end.*\n*Three years of service reviewed,*\n*Each fulfilling their duty.*\n*Difficult and cautious,*\n*Yet united in harmony.*\n*The gods now at rest,*\n*The people rejoicing.*\n*Revering this teaching,*\n*Trusting and obeying.*\n*O gods, bestow*\n*Your blessings upon our people.*\n*Heaven witnesses your virtue,*\n*Granting the title of True Man.*\n*Your images radiant,*\n*Ever-present in splendor.*\n*Your people offer sacrifices,*\n*Unceasing through ten thousand generations.*\n*Future gentlemen,*\n*Do not abandon this achievement.*\n*Carved upon these walls,*\n*To praise its beginnings.*\n\n**Record of the Restoration of Lingji Gong**\nIn the tenth month of the thirtieth year of the Zhiyuan era, in Min’s Jishanli, the scholar Zhang Jungui presented a written account of Lingji Wang’s temple, saying: “This is the gods’ own writing. The village has an ancient temple but no stele, its halls nearly in ruins.” In the fifth month, Shen Jianweng undertook its restoration, and Jungui, together with Zhou Tong and others, collaborated to bring it to completion. By the eighth month, the work was finished.\n\nThe gods manifested their power, bestowing an inscription to be carved in stone. They commanded Lin Digong Yannian of the village to transcribe it and entrusted me with inscribing the title. I dared not refuse and signed my name with reverence. In the twelfth month, they presented an ancient poem, saying: “This records the gods’ intent—why not inscribe it?” Though I had already assented, my brush had not yet found the time.\n\nThe following year, in the first month, they came in person to seek my promise and produced a poem bestowed by the gods—sixty-five verses in all. What connection have I to such literature, that the gods should urge me so earnestly? Once, the river god greeted Wang Bo, saying: “The Pavilion of Prince Teng is to have a preface—go and compose it.” At the time, the host had already prepared one with his son-in-law. Yet Wang Bo’s work emerged unexpectedly—was there not a destined hand for such writing?\n\nThereupon, I burned incense, struck my teeth together, and recited the record and poem several times. They bore no trace of mortal speech, and I exclaimed: “How extraordinary! To be wise, upright, and just is the essence of divinity; to awe with power and majesty is but its excess. This temple, since the Kaiyun era of Later Jin, has stood for ages. For years, the villagers have served with pure devotion—how could today’s events arise without cause?”\n\nScholar Zhang replied: “The gods’ writings extend beyond this record and poem. In former years, when their numinous light was still concealed, only fragments of words appeared. Now, their radiance shines forth, their compositions resplendent, engaging with people. Their intent guides—sometimes urging duty, sometimes leading to goodness, sometimes exhorting filial piety and reverence. When matters arise, they compose works like *Sealing the Well*, *Rhapsody on the Non-Divine*, *Biography of the Painter*, *Eulogy for the Mural*, *Chants of Liangfu*, and *Songs of the Unicorn*. There are prefaces, postscripts, memorials, debates, conduct, songs, odes, petitions—thousands of forms, each more marvelous than the last. Those who hear of it bring provisions and follow in admiration. If one approaches the gods with sincerity, they respond according to need. To knock and inquire is to receive—every word, every phrase, is literature.”",

      "translated_text": "The Laurel Dragon and Elder Jian, ascending and descending at its side, never failed to seek its writings day and night, using affairs to invoke the text and the text to verify affairs. Their hands responded to their hearts as if by contract or bond, thus joining their strength in this to extol the divine mandate’s glory.\n\nI then composed and sighed: This writing may well approach perfection—heaven sends timely rain, mountains and rivers bring forth clouds, and desires arise in due course. That which opens must first attend to spirits and gods; those who receive omens before the imperial court’s proclamations are the pitch-pipes of divine illumination. Since the Tang, our dynasty has selected scholars through examinations, and those born in this age vie to make their names through writing. Among the gods of Shu, there is one named Zitong, who manifests numinous power in that region and exclusively governs examination success. When the writings of the Ninety-Four Transformations were first intoned, the scholars of Shu revered and cherished him as if serving their own parents. Whenever one rose through perilous examinations to high office, they dared not claim their own ability but instead called it the god’s gift. Thus, scholars from other regions everywhere enshrined and worshipped him. The incense and altars of Zitong soon spread throughout the land. No honorific title bestowed upon him surpassed his renown.\n\nToday’s Lingji is the former day’s Zitong. Zitong flourished in Shu, while Lingji flourishes in Min. The writings of the Ninety-Four Transformations may not surpass it; we shall see the god’s incense and altars spread across the land just as Zitong’s did—how could his blessings be confined to a single region? Yet this writing, like heaven and earth, has never for a day been extinguished. What is temporarily obscured must become clear; what is temporarily obstructed must flourish. Thus, the gods have means to manifest their auspiciousness.\n\nOnce the divine stele was erected, the local scholars rejoiced and celebrated. At that time, Magistrate Zhou Zhuangxi presented the inscription for the stele’s reverse, saying: The gods of mountains must descend before they are born; the gods of Shenshen must descend before they are born. Will the present lord be born, or will he be born as the lord? These words, as if someone had guided his hand and pried open his mouth, were spoken thus. As the land’s numinosity grows daily more manifest, outstanding figures will emerge in kind. In time, they will surely make their names through writing. The nation’s prosperity is not only cause for scholars to rejoice but even more so for the gods.\n\nThe god’s surname was Xu. In life, he was a man; in death, he became a god. His merit lay in the state, his virtue in the people. The origins of his renown and the sequence of his temple enfeoffments are all recorded in the god’s own accounts. Here, I merely outline the temple’s restoration, the descent of writings, and the stele’s erection.\n\nMagistrate Zhang further said: When the imperial plaque was first requested in the past, the god’s surname and given name were unknown. The elders divined among the surnames and drew “Xu,” then named him *Wang*—“Hope”—implying his virtue could match the Four Directions, making him worthy of ranked sacrifices. Now, the god himself says: I am Jiang Wang, named Zhi Zheng; my younger brother is Rao Wang, named Zhi E. Thus, names are rectified, and origins are known.\n\nI once read the *History of the Five Dynasties* and, upon reaching the hereditary house of Wu, sighed over the Qi King’s lineage. When he, along with Liu Wei and Tao Ya, assisted Yang Xingmi in rising in Huainan, they were heroes of their age. Yet once he gained power, he ruled with such dominance. Nevertheless, he honored the Yang clan’s orphans and served them as a subject—how starkly this differs from Zhang Wenbiao’s refusal to serve Zhou Baoquan! The cosmos is boundless, past events are but dust, yet he had two sons whose names have fragranced a hundred years and whose temples have been fed for ten thousand generations. Alas, the Qi King has not died after all.\n\nRecorded on the day *jiazi*, two days before the Lantern Festival.\n\n*Preface to the Perfected Lingji*\n\nThe god’s surname, given name, and native place are recorded in the *History of the Five Dynasties*. In the fourth year of the *kaiyun* era of the Jin, the Perfected One harmonized with the imperial numen and descended here in radiant splendor. Counting by the ancient calendar, over two thousand *jiazi* cycles have passed. In the second year of the *jiaxi* era, upon receiving the court’s decree, we examined the *Rites of Sacrifice* and found him worthy of inclusion in the sacrificial canon. On every Three Primordials, Eight Festivals, *jiazi*, *gengshen*, and Dipper-Descending days, those who have matters to bring before the god must fast, purify themselves, and offer vegetarian sacrifices, holding solely to the god. Hold fast and do not lose this, and you will unite with the god. To unite is to merge with nature itself.",

      "translated_text": "The Yellow Emperor obtained it and ascended to the cloudy heavens. The Queen Mother of the West obtained it and sat in the Lesser Broadness. Now the spirit and soul of this god remain unclouded in their clarity, having obtained it to bestow upon Fuqiu Gong, Wangzi Qiao, Jin’s Sima Ziwei, Feng Dahe, and others, who roam the boundless heavens. Listen, yet no sound is heard—its sound is resplendent. Look, yet no name is seen—its name is lofty and luminous. The four seasons keep their proper order, the myriad things suffer no harm, and beneficent moisture is dispensed throughout heaven and earth. Who in later ages could ever fathom this?\n\nLong ago, Master Nanhua cited the words of the *Great Master*: \"Only when there is a Perfected One does there arise true knowledge.\" Recently, we reverently encountered the Thirty-Eighth Heavenly Master, who transmitted the *Great Simplicity’s Congealed Spirit*. The Broad Dao Perfected One, through the knowledge he possessed, ever regarded true knowledge as his teacher. Accordingly, a special memorial was submitted to the Celestial Capital, appointing Jiang Wang as the *Nine Heavens Golden Portal Radiant Dao Penetrating Virtue Great Immortal Manifest Numinous Universal Salvation Perfected One*, and his consort, Lady Xu, as the *Specially Appointed Harmonious Assisting Benevolent Immortal Consort*. Rao Wang was appointed as the *Nine Heavens Jade Portal Proclaiming Transformation Assisting Teaching High Immortal Illustrious Numinous Vast Salvation Perfected One*, and his consort, Lady Tao, as the *Specially Appointed Kindly Assisting Compassionate Immortal Consort*. Their illustrious renown blazes forth, leading the dragon’s way, so that the numinous powers in heaven may proclaim their mighty deeds.\n\nToday, in this era of Great Peace, no thing resists or defies; timely rain and sunshine respond in harmony. The villagers, scholars, and common folk all rejoice and leap for joy, facing north to dance, bow with clasped hands, and prostrate themselves, offering prayers for the emperor’s boundless longevity and the singular virtue of the god. May this record be inscribed for posterity upon metal and stone. A poem is appended to the account:\n\nObtaining the One, it becomes numinous—\nThis is called the god.\nThe god as god—\nYet able to refine essence.\nDim and obscure,\nWithout action, without form.\nPossessing nature and feeling,\nIt merges with the Dao in truth.\nProclaimed as Perfected One,\nHe soars to memorialize the Celestial Capital.\nHis singular merits and deeds—\nBroadcast upon metal and stone.\nGreat Immortal, High Immortal,\nAscending into the Nine Heavens.\nRain and sunshine never err—\nHe holds the power of creation.\nYour people, preserved and whole,\nRejoice and leap in exultation.\nHolding our sacrificial vessels,\nWho would dare not be reverent?\nThe god’s profound virtue—\nProclaimed in this ode.\nInscribed in stone forever,\nWhat is ten thousand times ten thousand years?\n\nComposed by Master Mingyuan of the Complete Teaching’s Mysterious Dharma, Daoist Registrar of Fuzhou Circuit, Liu Jingfu.\n\n*Record of the Divine Splendor of Aofeng*\n\nSouth of Min City, the great river flows from west to east, called the Gorge River, then the Ford River. Some twenty *li* farther, there stands a mountain called Aofeng. It commands the finest of the surrounding peaks and converges with the waters’ confluence, and there the temple is located. Beside it, dwellings cluster like stars or a chessboard’s pieces. The god abides where the people reside, and in due seasons they offer obeisance. With sacrificial animals, fruits, and grains, they partake of the land’s bounty. The people rely on the god’s blessings, so that young and old, livestock and crops, are free from the calamities of flood or drought, and live in peace.\n\nThis mutual dependence of god and people embodies the ultimate principle of yin and yang, a bond the world cannot sever. The two gods of Aofeng, traditionally surnamed Xu, were brothers of Li Zhigao of the Southern Tang. The elder, Zhizheng, was titled *Golden Portal Perfected One*. The younger, Zhikua, was titled *Jade Portal Perfected One*. It is said that in the Tang era, they led troops into Min, passing through Zhang to suppress rebels, and encamped at Aofeng, where they rendered meritorious service. Immortals appeared on Zhi Isle, and celestial lanterns and celestial music descended upon the site, so a temple was established there.\n\nAccording to history, Zhizheng was the fifth son of Li Wen’s younger brother and was enfeoffed as Jiang Wang, later changed to Wei. Zhikua was the sixth son of Li Wen’s younger brother and was enfeoffed as Rao Wang, later changed to Liang. The Min kings, Li Yan Zheng and Li Yan Xi, were at odds, and the kingdom grew increasingly disordered. The Tang dispatched their general, Cha Wen, to expel them, seizing victory to conquer the prefectures of Quan and Zhang.",

On every Three Primordials, Eight Festivals, *jiazi*, *gengshen*, and Dipper-Descending days, those who have matters to bring before the god must fast, purify themselves, and offer vegetarian sacrifices, holding solely to the god. Hold fast and do not lose this, and you will unite with the god. To unite is to merge with nature itself.",

Yet with Aofeng’s towering majesty and the mountains and rivers conjoined in harmony, it is fitting that spirits should reside here. The gods embrace the land, manifesting abundance and answering prayers—supplications as though met with direct response. Jade within the mountain moistens the trees; pearls in the deep lend radiance to the waters. Such is the principle, and how much more so when merit and virtue are born. That the villagers, upon their passing, should honor them with a shrine is but proper ritual.\n\nHanlin Academician and Court Attendant Gao Tingli of Changle, whose son Gao Xiong hastened to pray at the shrine, found the divine resonance so immediate it was as though he received instruction face-to-face.

      "translated_text": "To the Supreme Primordial and Supreme Perfection Lords,\n\nAs the three yang energies usher in prosperity, so too does human endeavor commence. With reverence akin to standing before the two palaces, we trust that the celestial heart may yet be moved. We lay forth our humble wishes, praying for ever-greater abundance of vast blessings.\n\nThis servant, trembling with awe, bows his head in prostration. We reverently recall the Nine Heavens’ Two Perfected Lords, descendants of the Lord of Yan, enfeoffed in the land of Qi. Their mighty virtue matches the encompassing power of heaven and earth, and through it they succor the people, extending the blessings of rain and dew. Their divine efficacy is boundless, their uprightness impartial. For four hundred years, their temple sacrifices have endured; their celestial titles span sixteen characters. Who among those who have witnessed their grace would dare fail in reverence?\n\nWe humbly pray that you bestow your distant blessings, that we may sing the *rangrang* and *jianjian* odes. Preserve our descendants, that they may extol the *zhezhe* and *shengsheng* virtues.\n\n**Memorial of Prayer for Peace to the Supreme Perfection Lord**\n\nCold and heat assail us—such are the shallow schemes of petty men. Yet the noble, dwelling in peace, ever contemplate peril and act with foresight. Though we have long offered our prayers, we rely on unseen aid to sustain us.\n\nWith gratitude, we declare: Reverently considering the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Aid Perfected Lord, whose virtue matches heaven and earth, whose blessings flow like rain and dew, we behold the radiance of your manifest power and the boundless compassion of your salvific heart. We, your servants, dwell as common folk, gathered in humble abodes. Long sheltered beneath your celestial protection, we dare to turn our sunflower hearts toward you in sincerity. Yet we have failed in cultivation, unaware of our shame.\n\nMindful of the warning from the trembling neighbor, we value the virtue of aiding those nearby. Thus, in the peace of a shared well, we must guard against one who, falling in, would act only after the fact. To act with caution is to spare future sorrow.\n\nWe further pray that rain may fall upon our private fields, yielding abundance—plump grains, sturdy stalks. Bestow upon the people the blessings of longevity, wealth, and well-being.\n\nMoreover, spirits unworthy of sacrifice are those who fail to ward off disaster and repel calamity. Though heaven-sent afflictions may be averted, how dare we delay in observing fasts, upholding precepts, and serving with reverence and trembling awe? Gazing upward at your celestial virtue, we bow in gratitude for the imperial grace that moves the earth.\n\nWe, your servants, dwell as neighbors beneath the same trees and mulberries. Ashamed of our ignorance, like those confined to a well, we respectfully unite our community in supplication, for the people’s voice is heard. Once, we heard that even the excesses of one’s own faults could turn away divine wrath. Now, though we may seem as unlearned as children, how could the remedies of great ministers be exhausted? Or perhaps the calculations of the people of Pu have already taken root—some gluttonous as the ravenous Cao Ju, others haughty as Zi Chang. Who would dare claim faultlessness? Yet why not seek omens, that we may know whether fortune or misfortune awaits?\n\nTruly, we have long offered our prayers. If the numinous responds, if it arrives, is this not as it should be? We strive to act rightly, yet fear overstepping in speech. Failing to emulate Yao and Bin, we bear the guilt of falsehood. Heaven’s script and translated talismans are inscribed upon the altar. If omens are ominous, they are deemed portents. The divine brush, following the laws of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, ensures that baleful influences are expelled and falsehoods eradicated. We pray you do not indulge excess, lest it breed suffering—this is our wish, and may the spirits witness it.\n\nThus, we prostrate ourselves before the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace and Jade Palace Perfected Lords, who are sagely and divine, both civil and martial. When gathered, they manifest their radiant power; when dispersed, they extend their boundless compassion. For a thousand years, their sacrificial rites have been solemn; their sixteen-character titles are grand. Their might shakes the thunder’s wrath, reducing the Five Peaks to dust; their merit rivals the sun and moon, illuminating all directions. They drive pestilent spirits to the mountains’ left and establish defenses to the south of the Red River. The seas and lands are purified, villages and hamlets are at peace. Below, they relieve the suffering of all beings; above, they fulfill the Most High’s compassionate virtue of cherishing life. Though their grace pervades the people’s hearts—even the children who play in the fields—what need have they of imperial power?\n\nWe humbly pray that you dispel misfortune, ensuring enduring peace. May each safeguard their well-being, concealing faults and embracing flaws. May right and wrong alike be shielded. We dare not offer the meager gift of water celery, nor presume to speak of the debt repaid by binding grass.\n\n**Memorial from the Villagers to Preserve the Perfected Lord**\n\nWe have heard that merit is called the Dao, originating in the boundless beginning—profound and obscure, beyond knowledge or perception, beyond the reach of thought or calculation. Since the Supreme Perfection Sovereign inscribed the purple script, those who study the Dao have been able to trace its source and channel its flow, compiling sacred texts and rituals for the world’s ears and eyes.\n\nNow there is a spirit who takes the observance of fasts and precepts as merit, who vows to deliver the living and ferry the dead. His words align with the sacred canons. All who are talented and virtuous recite them, and their resonance may yet be verified.\n\nWe have closely observed the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace Perfected Lord Xu and the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palace Perfected Lord Xu, whose renown spans the world and whose merit resides among the people. Examining their conduct within and their deeds without, we find their very bones and appearance befitting immortals—men of sincere goodness, who have accumulated merit and deeply cherish the Three Treasures. If not for the fortunate convergence of past karma, who could attain such profound understanding of transformation?\n\nTheir works—the *Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts for Transformation*, the *Nine Hells Spirit Lamp Rites*, the *Three Realms Purification Rites*, and the *Horse Protection Rites*—all derive from the Most High’s mysterious words. Through careful inquiry and verification, they naturally form chapters. Their numinous verses and chants serve as bridges across the kalpas.",

      "translated_text": "What is called \"closing the door and riding the carriage\" disregards the passage of years. Beyond these, there are the *Numinous Aid Special Rites*, the *Original Vows Ritual Texts*, and the *Seven Luminaries Lamp Rites*—none of which were composed for personal merit, but rather at the people’s request.\n\nThis humble servant’s nature is crude and foolish, and my words are of little weight. Yet in examining affairs and assessing abilities, I recognize my duty. I humbly petition to refine and compile these works into a single collection, which has already been transcribed and presented. By the grace of the Sacred, this servant Xu and others have been appointed to office and elevated to the ranks of immortals. Now, I earnestly hope the Sacred Mercy will grant our request, allowing the ritual canons we have composed to circulate throughout the Three Realms. In every place they reach, let them be reverently followed and implemented. This will not only manifest the boundless salvific power of Numinous Aid but also strengthen our armies and console the hopes of the people in the southeast.\n\nI prostrate myself to await your decree.\n\n---\n*Eulogies of the Numinous* (Volume Two) concludes.\n*Eulogies of the Numinous* (Volume Three)\nPreface, Memorials, and Postscripts\n\n**Preface to the Ritual Forms of the Perfected Lords**\n\nI have long held that the Dao of Laozi is fully expounded in the *Five Thousand Words*, yet later scholars fail to grasp its entirety due to insufficient study. Only the transmission of the Han Celestial Master preserves its essence, and for over twelve hundred years, its renown has shone across the four directions. From high ministers to humble servants, all who seek longevity and well-being turn their hearts to it in reverence.\n\nNow, manifesting as divine, they are called the Numinous Aid Perfected Lords. Through their numinous vessel, they reveal their power—could this not stem from the lead-and-mercury method bestowed by the Celestial Master in a former life? A single point of pearl-light shines unceasingly. Every character and phrase they compose radiates with literary brilliance.\n\nAt first, I heard of this with astonishment, torn between belief and doubt. One day, I came bearing incense to gaze upon their shrine, where I beheld their steles and eulogies—words far beyond the mundane. Doubt gave way to conviction. Yet this book, a single volume, is guarded with utmost care by the local gentry, seldom shown to others. After long entreaty, I finally obtained it. Burning incense, I recited it several times. Its profound meanings are all drawn from the scriptures of the Most High, abstruse yet luminous, perfectly aligned with the Dao. The hidden hymns of the heavens resound in harmony. Their salvific power vows to embrace the seas and mountains. The divine mechanism is wondrous, now concealed, now revealed—how could shallow learning or limited wisdom presume to discuss it?\n\nYet while the divine is made manifest through the Perfected Lords, I have repeatedly wished to compose a preface or postscript, fearing that scholars might dismiss it as superfluous. As for the virtue of the Perfected Lords, it shines like the sun and moon; surely a sage will one day write their preface. I merely sketch its broad outlines here.\n\nWritten in the thirtieth year of the Zhengyuan era, by Ouyang Gongzhu, Assistant Instructor of the Lu Academy, on the eve of the Lantern Festival.\n\n---\n**Preface to the Vows of the Perfected Lords**\n\nThe vow is the vow of the Perfected Lords, and it is also the vow of all people. Each bow and prostration expresses the sincerity of the heart. Sincerity of heart is the perfection of goodness. The goodness inherent in human nature is like water flowing downward. To fail to correct one’s faults—this is my concern. This concern is why the vow exists: to cultivate goodness.\n\nIs this merely about the text of the vow? Gazing upward at the heavens, one finds the number twenty-five. Looking downward at the earth, one finds the number thirty. Combined, they yield fifty-five. It is through this number that the vow is fulfilled. If not for working in harmony with heaven and earth, how could this be achieved?\n\nGoodness is the guiding principle of heaven and earth. Even the slightest trace of deceit, arrogance, or negligence—this is not the vow I speak of. How could it be equated with true goodness? As the *Tradition* says: \"Goodness has no fixed master; it aligns with unity.\" There is no other way. Begin with it, end with it, and do not halt midway—only then is it perfectly good and perfectly beautiful.\n\nGoodness is the foundation of fortune, and fortune is the accumulation of goodness. Tang Gao Yu once said: \"Accumulate goodness to attain fortune; do not expend wealth to seek fortune.\" If fortune can be sought without expending wealth, can one who cultivates goodness be said to expend wealth? When you see goodness, share it; when you hear of goodness, proclaim it. All who share this aspiration should encourage one another, so that we may stand without shame before heaven and earth—and before the Perfected Lords. This, too, is the great vow of the Perfected Lords.\n\n---\n**Memorial for the Restoration of the Numinous Aid Palace**\n\nAccording to the *History of the Five Dynasties: House of Huainan*, Prince Qi of Xu had two sons, the Prince of Jiang and the Prince of Yu—now the Golden Palace and Jade Palace Perfected Lords. The Perfected Lords were always skilled in literary composition, their numinous responses swift and efficacious. The people of the southeast have relied on their protection, far beyond the aid of Cao Gui.\n\nIn the *gengyin* year of the Yongle era, a great drought struck, deeply troubling the regional officials. Only the Perfected Lords manifested their power by bringing timely rain, a singular demonstration of their efficacy. Officials and commoners alike agreed that the temple’s dilapidated state demanded restoration, to honor the divine grace of the Perfected Lords. I respectfully submit this brief memorial, knocking at the gates of the great, wielding my brush to invoke blessings.\n\nThey abandoned office to become immortals, their literary legacy illuminating the jade registers of heaven. They halted troops and quelled bandits, their incense and offerings securing the golden turtle for ten thousand years. The sweet pear tree evokes the memory of the Duke of Shao; the magic fungus flourishes in the ancestral courtyard. Raise high the gates, expand the halls—dimly resembling the embroidered peaks. Before the palace, reverence lingers as if the Perfected Lords were present, their majesty radiant.\n\nBeyond the brocade-clad city, clouds and mist curl lazily around the jade windows, where sun and moon pass in tranquility. Approaching the golden palace, wondrous omens gather, fostering the vitality of long life. Blessings and prosperity flow abundantly, as the virtuous lords of the realm flourish. They are the pillars of the great realm, the scales of far and near. Seeking fortune and avoiding misfortune, they consult the treasure scrolls and jade texts of heaven. Praising goodness and reproving evil, they traverse the world as golden brothers and jade kin.",

      "translated_text": "Amid the turning seasons, they ever hasten past the courtyard in reverence; frost and dew mourn the nearness of the immortal isles. At the celestial court, the favored ministers receive divine prescriptions, tasting the elixirs and remedies first. In the maritime lands, the people rejoice at timely rains, and withered seedlings ripen early.\n\nMoss traces reappear, creeping into the curtains with verdant hues, half-encroaching upon the paths of footsteps; the wind stirs the green tiles. With hands that mend the heavens, they reconstruct new eaves, while rain washes the crumbling walls to lay fresh foundations. Yet adhering to old customs, they fail to rouse the unyielding courage of former days—how then may they achieve the unparalleled feat? Were the mighty brush not ceaselessly to inscribe it, the towering palace walls would rise in but a moment.\n\nTo the left, the Bei Brook; to the right, the Lai River—beyond, the Purple Terrace lies but a footstep from the immortals’ source. Before, a jade table; behind, the soaring *feilong*—the literary brush thrusts high as the Oxherd and Weaver stars. When one man enjoys felicity, ten thousand states share in prosperity.\n\nRespectfully inscribed.\n\nComposed by Lin Hanmeng of Boling.\n\n*Two Postscripts by Immortal Xu Xianhao*\n\nWhen a noble man encounters an age governed by principle, he composes literature to advance his aspirations, thereby enacting the Dao—this is no mere fortune, but what is fitting. The world may indeed be ordered through wisdom and effort; those who aspire to the Dao and seek efficacy in their time through literature must align with the gates of the worthy. To embrace uncut jade at Mount Jing is not misfortune—it, too, is fitting.\n\nYet how can the numinous be deemed ordinary in the dim and fragrant obscurity? That literature should startle and move people—is this not strange? The *Collected Works of Immortal Xu Xianhao*—comprising records, eulogies, rhapsodies, and odes—forms a vast compendium. Its words, carefully weighed and never excessive, all offer critiques that challenge the age. Though the realms of the hidden and manifest are sundered, one cannot escape the burdens of convention, and thus confusion lingers.\n\nIn my humble view, the noble men of this land, though devoted to the Dao and living in an age of principle, find their Way fitting yet their aspirations thwarted. Thus, they borrow literature to lend their teachings a numinous aura. In the moment of wielding the brush, is there truly no exertion of force? Whether man or spirit, I dare not presume to know. Were it so, the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture* would have emerged solely from Fuxi and Yu the Great.\n\nTherefore, I refrain from binding these words to any doctrine and instead append them to the postscripts of the esteemed.\n\n---\n\nMoreover, spirits rely on men to take form, just as men rely on spirits to achieve completion. In the intercourse between man and spirit, every word and utterance is literature. Does literature embody the spirit, or does the spirit embody the man? The *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture* seem to border on the uncanny. Though Fuxi and Yu, those great sages, validated and trusted them, how could the dull-witted masses of later ages not doubt and perplex?\n\nReading these works through the lens of spirit-human exchange and examining their words, one finds that all align with the hearts of sages and worthies. Ritual, law, punishment, and governance are as clear as the palm of one’s hand—why then this urgent concern for the people’s welfare? Spirit or man, who could fail to doubt and perplex?\n\nThe notion that fish and dragons aid wind and rain is but a reflection of human sentiment. Thus, I say: sincerity illumines, though it resides in the numinous, its realization lies with man. If even a single matter remains unresolved or a single phrase unformed, though one might borrow another’s voice, I know not how it could suffice.\n\nIn the moment of wielding the brush, I cannot shirk my duty.

By the *wei* hour, rain fell. That night, the ritual altar was opened, and the rites were performed according to the canons. A grand purification offering was made to the Dragon King, and a hundred prostrations were offered in the *Chant of Heavenly Repentance*.\n\nThat night, sweet rain poured in abundance. By the twentieth day, heavy rains drenched the fields, filling the furrows to satisfaction. In profound gratitude, we extend our thanks. We have invited the assembled immortals to conduct another purification offering to the Dragon King, the Field Deities, and all spirits. We pray to the Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper, lighting lamps for the constellations, and perform the ritual at dawn to repay the True Lord.\n\nWe present humble offerings, completing the rites in full, and hold a purification feast to express our gratitude. We humbly pray for continued blessings—may sunshine and rain align with the great harmony of heaven and earth. May the harvests be as abundant as millet stacks and grain beams, bringing the auspicious fruition of all crops. We trust in the boundless virtue of the Ninefold Imperial Court, spreading prosperity to the eight directions. May the songs of joy resound like the *Striking the Earth* hymn, and may all things flourish in pairs. May the Sacred Lifespan equal that of heaven, enduring for ten thousand myriad years. May all living things thrive in harmony, and the realm know eternal peace and prosperity.\n\nThese words convey our deepest reverence, our hearts brimming with fervent devotion.\n\n*Thus concludes Volume Three of the* Hymns in Praise of the Divine.\n*Volume Four of the* Hymns in Praise of the Divine *begins.*",

      "translated_text": "**Poem to the Supreme Perfection**\n\n**By Zhao Di of Baihu**\n\nTo the south of Fangshan stands an ancient divine shrine, traditionally held to be the abode of the brothers Xu Zhiyu of the Five Dynasties, known as the Golden Portal and Jade Portal—Two Perfected Ones. These Perfected Ones, scions of divine luminaries, have passed nearly five centuries. Yet their spirits, still in heaven, have not forsaken our people: in times of drought or deluge, pestilence or plague, prayers to them are swiftly answered.\n\nThough I, Di, am unworthy, I wished to bow before their shrine and offer supplication. Thus, I composed these *Step-in-Void Hymns* in their honor.\n\n**I**\nThe Sage is a scion of divine luminaries,\nWhose spirit roams the Supreme Nethermost.\nCrimson tablets ascend through purple clouds,\nJade canopies link the azure vaults.\nTheir radiance knows no dusk nor dawn,\nIn purity and emptiness, how resplendent they gleam.\nAuspicious qi drifts from the Jade Grotto,\nRosy hues adorn the crimson forest’s edge.\nThis morning, they descend in solemn majesty,\nPhoenix banners trailing in ethereal grace.\nThey attend to us, the folk of this realm,\nDispelling our entanglements and strife.\n\n**II**\nHow lofty the jade palace,\nIts heights brushing the verdant peaks.\nA heroic aura, divine through a hundred generations,\nTheir numinous light gleams through the four seasons.\nDignified in bearing, ever august,\nThe temple’s visage commands reverence.\nIn the azure hall, incense smoke hangs cold,\nBeneath the white sun, the rafters chill with cloud.\nHow frail this mortal frame,\nHow may it reach such divine splendor?\n\n**III**\nHow gracefully the feathered canopy sways,\nAs sacred vapors descend from the cinnabar gates.\nThe faint strains of phoenix song drift,\nCool autumn breezes scatter through the grove.\nJade nectar flows in purple clouds,\nDivine auroras waft with crimson tablets.\nFeathered robes sink beyond the stars,\nCelestial music fades in empty air.\nThe Great Void, so vast and still,\nSwiftly they vanish into rosy mist.\nOnly the *Step-in-Void* hymn lingers,\nBeneath the moonlit peach blossoms.\n\n**IV**\nLike flowering branches of jade, entwined,\nBy imperial decree, they govern our land.\nWhen the yin winds arise,\nA refreshing breeze brings sacred rain.\nPestilence yields to their divine grace,\nFamine is averted by their numinous shield.\nIn the unseen workings of the loom,\nTheir providence shines bright and clear.\nHigh in the Supreme Nethermost Heaven,\nTheir radiance graces the Palace of Pure Emptiness.\nJade pendants adorn their rosy robes,\nFeathered canopies trace the clouded paths.\nColdly they ride the endless wind,\nAscending to pay homage at the Purple Mists.\n\n---\n\n**Twelve Hymns at the Lingji Palace**\n\n**By Yang Jingheng, Left Assistant Director of the Ministry of War**\n\nBy imperial command, the Perfected One Zhang of the Supreme Clarity performed the *Yanxi* Offering at Lingji Palace. I composed this to commemorate the auspicious gathering.\n\nThe rivers and mountains proclaim their numinous might as the grand fortune unfolds,\nFrom the Supreme Clarity descends the immortal guest, bearing incense.\nThe celestial altar’s rites commence beneath clouded banners,\nFeathered regalia hasten to the moonlit halls and return.\nThis blessed assembly delights in ascending the sacred precinct,\nThough weak currents may yet separate us from Penglai.\nI pray the wind may lend me a crane from the Jasper Terrace,\nTo soar and bestow boundless blessings across the nine realms.\n\n**By the Same Author**\n\nVerdant peaks soar to meet the Turtle Peak,\nThe Purple Palace’s heights chill the vast heavens.\nThe cinnabar crucible’s glow illumines a thousand peaks beneath the moon,\nThe Jade Terrace’s fragrance drifts on winds through a hundred flowers.\nTheir divine power blazes, revealing numinous favor,\nThe Emperor’s virtue, exalted, bestows titles upon them.\nIn what year was this palace granted?\nWhen the Perfected One was enfeoffed, he passed beyond the white clouds.\n\n**By Peng Shen of Gusu, Right Assistant Director**\n\nFlower-laden fragrant chariots harness purple simurghs,\nThe flute’s melody descends from the rainbowed clouds.\nThe stars of the nine heavens float above the mountain temple,\nThrough five watches, wind and thunder encircle the stone altar.\nImmortal fruits weigh down the branches—cinnabar lychees ripen,\nCool shade fills the courtyard where emerald wutong trees stand cold.\nTheir divine power, resplendent, brings manifold blessings,\nForever aiding the imperial realm to endure in eternal peace.\n\n**By Li Ye, Right Assistant Director**\n\nStealing a moment from official duties, I pay homage at the divine palace,\nWhere stone paths wind through misty streams.\nA pair of crows beyond the window cry in the white daylight,\nA profusion of blossoms along the steps unfurl in spring’s crimson.\nWielding the tally, they bear princely rank in this age,\nWarding off calamity, their martial deeds shall be recorded in time.\nThe numinous shrine bestows grace upon this land,\nIts glory shall endure, its offerings unceasing.\n\n**By Zhou Chang of Fengyang, Surveillance Commissioner**\n\nTwice a year I come to the immortal palace,\nPlanting apricot trees, my heart sincere in gratitude.\nWondrous medicines heal chronic ailments,\nSacred talismans revive the weary and infirm.\nAt the grotto’s mouth, flowers frame the quest for the true deer,\nOn the peak’s waist, rain obscures the dragon’s dharma discourse.\nInscribed steles proclaim the imperial robes and blood offerings,\nEnnobled with titles, the sacred grace soars high.\n\n**By Qian Shu of Shaoxing, Left Assistant Director**\n\nBriefly halting my warhorse, I ascend Ao Peak,\nBowing again, I recall the brothers’ merits.\nIn days past, they quelled strife with blades,\nFor a thousand years, their temple has known autumn and winter offerings.\nVerses composed in prayer bear wondrous efficacy,\nThe numinous aid of Lingji earns grand enfeoffment.\nTheir divine power, vast, shields the nation and shelters the people,\nTimely rains and sunshine bring blessings in due measure.\n\n**By Zeng Ji of Sanshan, Supervising Secretary of the Ministry of War**\n\nOnce I led the celestial troops across the Xiang River,\nA million fierce warriors surrendered at a glance.\nThe Golden Ao’s blood offerings were not in vain,\nThe Jade Portal’s cinnabar decrees came in pairs.\nSwords and pendants stood in solemn array, clouds swirling,\nPavilions and terraces rose in layered stone grandeur.\nTheir heroic names endure through past and present,\nAnd their mighty writings crown the seas and lands.\n\n**By Yang Ningyuan of Xiujiang, Vice Director of the Ministry of Revenue**\n\nMountains green and waters fair respond to the mysterious workings,\nHeaven bestowed worthy guardians to watch over the islets.\nFrom dawn to dusk, they discern fortune and misfortune,\nJudging right and wrong with the precision of a hair’s breadth.\nThe ancient shrine stands beyond the Three Mountains,\nIts numinous favor spreads, known across the four seas.\nThe royal scions, ethereal, entered the immortal registers,\nTheir fragrant legacy is truly rare in this world.\n\n**By Zhu Chun of Shanyin, Supervising Secretary of the Ministry of Justice**\n\nReverently bearing the jade tally, I traversed the southern lands of Min.\nPassing Ao Peak, I visited the Lingji Palace of vast grace, gazing and bowing.\nAs the rites concluded, the temple officials, leading three or five youths in feathered robes and crane cloaks,\nInvited me to the Chrysanthemum Pavilion.\nOver tea, in idle conversation, they requested a poem to mark my reverent visit.\nThus, I hastily composed a few verses to glimpse but a fraction of the sacred dynasty’s divine majesty.\nMay later scholars correct my humble offering—how fortunate that would be.\n\nReverently bearing the imperial tally to southern Min,\nI halted my carriage to pay homage to the Two Perfected Ones.\nThe temple’s halls rise a thousand fathoms in solemn grandeur,\nTheir brocade robes gleam anew through the four seasons.\nJasper steles record their deeds, descending from heaven,\nJade ornaments radiate light, illuminating the seashores.",

Moreover, they mastered the turning of transformative *qi*, greatly manifesting divine favor to protect the sacred person of the emperor. Thus, it is fitting to bestow upon them honorific titles and ensure their eternal veneration, that the divine protection may abide. All this stems from the supreme benevolence and profound love of the sagely Son of Heaven. That Heaven and Earth endure together is no mere coincidence.\n\nI bowed deeply and kowtowed, then composed this poem:\n\nOnce in the annals of history I saw heroes,\nBrothers of one heart who built great merit.\nIn life they together fulfilled filial piety,\nAnd in death, know they still offered loyalty.\nOn clear nights, propitious dreams confirm the illustrious age,\nWith rare elixirs from Red Stone, the emperor’s health is restored.\nThe temple’s majesty upholds solemn rites,\nAnd for a thousand ages, the people revere their lofty virtue.\n\n**—Yang Zheng of Jishui, Surveillance Commissioner**\n\nElder and younger brothers, side by side, preserved the great Perfected,\nIn life ennobled with royal titles, in death revered as gods.\nTheir distant transmissions of esoteric writs conveyed alchemical secrets,\nTheir extraordinary merits moved the imperial court.\nThe immortal register bestows grand honors,\nAt Ao Peak, the solemn rites renew in splendor.\nIncense clouds drift beyond the banyan’s shade,\nWhere sacrificial offerings endure year after year.\n\n**—Chai Shan, Eunuch Envoy to the Lands of Fusang and Others**\n\nCharged with command, I led troops to the frontiers,\nWhere distant lands above revere the One, and below fulfill their duties.\nI tarried in the Three Mountains,\nLong favored by the wondrous presence here.\nNow, with reverence, I hold the embroidered banners,\nExtolling the sacred titles,\nTo invoke blessings for the voyages to and from Huai and the seas.\nMay the gods deign to accept,\nAs rites are solemnly observed.\nIn this hallowed retreat, moved by the scene,\nI gathered my thoughts to praise the divine virtue.\nMay later readers find refinement in these words.\n\nSouthern Min abounds with wondrous peaks,\nWhere Dongting and Taihua mountains intertwine.\nWhere true dragons once concealed their sacred traces,\nFloating radiance and layered verdure fill the ridges.\nThe Perfected Ones, in mystery both hidden and manifest,\nSilently turn the celestial mechanisms to spread divine power.\nAbove, with elixirs they guard the emperor’s person,\nBelow, with vast grace they shelter the people’s hardships.\nI have heard how brothers, equally filial and reverent,\nExhausted their loyalty through five dynasties, surpassing all heroes.\nIn life, renowned ministers; in death, enshrined and venerated,\nTheir manifest blessings and wondrous deeds shall know no end.\nThe temple’s awe-inspiring majesty is unmatched in the world,\nAs it presides over the eight thousand *li* of Jiangnan.\nWhen the five-colored clouds disperse, the golden Ao is revealed,\nPouring forth the Dragon Spring’s pure waters.\n\nAt that time, entrusted with a mission to distant lands,\nI came here in utmost sincerity to offer this hymn of eternal spirit.\nI saw only the quiet birds conversing on the moss,\nAnd blossoms, slick with wind, filling the valleys.\nHave you not seen the purity of Wuling’s landscapes?\nAt Fan’s mouth, where rivers and mountains are most serene.\nTo glimpse such clarity—what cares might dissolve?\nHere, in this moment, all is vivid and near.\nEntering the immortals’ path beneath the embroidered banners,\nA single soaring peak welcomes them.\nCarriages and horses arrive from the empty sky at times,\nWhile jade pendants chime in the nine heavens as a pair.\nThe azure birds sing as the wind sighs in the sacred precincts,\nThis realm’s purity shall not come again.\nThough I offer my sincerest devotion, lacking even a cup of wine,\nI pray the incense smoke may never fade,\nAnd endure as long as Heaven and Earth.\n\n**—Guo Jingfu of Bai Lake, *Spending the Night at Lingji Palace***\n\nTogether we reach the Perfected Ones’ realm,\nIn the bamboo lodge beyond, the fast is pure.\nDreams return to the lone island’s moon,\nCold seeps into my robe like frost.\nThe night’s *qi* stirs the divine Ao,\nAutumn’s sounds carry the soaring auspicious crane.\nI rise and dress, sleepless once more,\nAs the ethereal mist reveals the celestial fragrance.\n\n**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *Ten Marvelous Peaks: Golden Ao Peak***\n\nThe golden Ao came from the sea,\nIts extraordinary beauty infused with numinous essence.\nIt seems a coiled azure dragon,\nSoaring amidst the radiant clouds.\nThe cassia halls float in cinnabar light,\nThe lingzhi chambers conceal immortal mysteries.\nAt times, I gaze upon the returning crane’s chariot,\nAs celestial fragrance suffuses the misty verdure.\n\n**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *Golden Ao Peak***\n\nA speck of gold floated up from the sea,\nForming a cinnabar cavern amid the clouded woods.\nThe gods claimed this land of concentrated numinosity,\nSpreading true *qi* through all ages.\n\n**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *White Deer Peak***\n\nWhite Deer Peak, its verdure piled like jade,\nThe deer followed the clouds, never to return.\nEven now, on the path by the stream’s scattered stones,\nI imagine their tracks lingering on the green moss.\n\n**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *White Deer Peak***\n\nThe immortal deer, bearing flowers, passed this way,\nOpening a Chan temple in the cliffs’ secluded nook.\nThe green mountains remain unchanged, their name enduring,\nEver inspiring the forest monks’ joyful verses.\n\n**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *Brush Peak***\n\nThis mountain soars into the azure void,\nThree divine peaks stand in sharp relief.\nFlying verdure cascades like a dragon’s pool,\nStill holding the inkstone’s waters.\nClouds welcome the returning brush formations,\nStars encircle the rising glow.\nMay the divine mechanism unfold,\nEver offering tribute to the enlightened ruler.\n\n**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *Brush Peak***\n\nIts dynamic force, solitary and towering, pierces the emerald haze,\nFrom afar, it seems to paint the mist and clouds.\nAfter the banished immortal’s dream ended in spring’s breeze,\nWho knows how many times the flowers have bloomed on its summit?\n\n**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *Lotus Peak***\n\nTo the south, Lotus Peak rises a myriad fathoms in autumn,\nThe pure depths of Jade Well float with auspicious light.\nI know that each night where the fragrance drifts,\nIt scatters into the twelve jade towers of the immortals.\n\n**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *Lotus Peak***\n\nThe Jade Well’s roots transplanted to the emerald ridges,\nStanding tall and solitary above the clouds.\nWhen the Perfected Ones gather the jade blossoms,\nIt all seems like the Jade Pool after the immortals’ feast.\n\n**—Guo Yi of Bai Lake, *Flying Peng Peak***\n\nBeyond the world’s Penglai, this peak,\nIts beauty and grandeur adorned with jade-like plants.\nIt flew forth from the Three Spirits,\nAmidst these ten marvels.\nHeaven opens the White Jade Pot,\nNight illuminates the cinnabar flames.\nIf immortals may be sought,\nI shall part the clouds to seek their hidden depths.\n\n**—Li Shuyi of Longxi, *Flying Peng Peak***\n\nFrom the sea of islands, which peak flew here?\nAt its summit, the sunlit jade lotus stands sharp and clear.",

Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nIts radiance at the Dipper’s edge—unclimbable,\nYet in what year did it rise, verdant, to stand among men?\nOnce atop the golden turtle, gazing afar,\nIt still resembles Penglai—yet which mountain of that isle?\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nPeaks cluster on all sides like painted screens,\nTheir perilous heights soaring straight into the azure void.\nAt times, in the still night, a crimson glow blazes,\nA single radiant beam piercing the Dipper’s stars.\n\n**Square Rock Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nSquare Rock beside Kongtong,\nIts divine beauty fit to grasp.\nGazing, it seems a dark leopard crouched,\nIts reflection inverted in the limpid river’s jade.\nAbove dwells an elder who feeds on lingzhi,\nChanting long songs upon the mossy stones.\nYou, too, should brush the dust from your robes,\nAnd daily wander with the white clouds.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nIts summit, sheer as if cleaved by the sky,\nThe cranes’ path to immortality—spotless, without moss.\nThe celestial winds blow down the hanging cliff’s waterfall,\nScattering into midnight thunder upon the crags.\n\n**Purple Terrace Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nEmerald cliffs and cinnabar crags meet the lofty terrace,\nAs spring deepens, misty purple clouds amass.\nWho plays the jade flute beneath the terrace’s moon?\nIt must herald the return of the turtle-peak’s crane-borne chariot.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nPurple qi swirls, unbrushed and impenetrable,\nIts perilous base thrust forth, carved by heaven itself.\nThe jade pendants’ chime falls before the terrace’s moon—\nSurely immortals ride the cranes to descend.\n\n**Ancient City Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nHow many households remain in the ancient city?\nThe mountain stands empty, few traces of the past.\nMossy paths—no dust of fragrance,\nSmoky cliffs gather the cold’s hue.\nWind chimes through pines and cassia by the pool,\nMoonlight climbs the vines and rocks.\nDo not heed the crows’ night cries—\nThey stir memories of bygone days.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nEmerald cliffs and cinnabar crags—uneven the path,\nYet travelers still speak of the ancient city’s name.\nWind and spring daily deliver their clear, cool melody,\nUnaccompanied by the plum blossoms’ iron flute.\n\n**Great Peace Peak**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nThe jade candle’s glow descends from the nine heavens,\nA thousand peaks and ten thousand valleys carry the cloud-borne song.\nWho joins in singing the *Great Peace*?\nBest to ascend the golden turtle’s hundred-foot bridge.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nThe scene of Great Peace—boundless and vast,\nHalf veiled among these famed mountains’ finest.\nGrateful that the spirits nest here in peace,\nShaded cliffs and trees bathed in the wind of benevolence.\n\n**Forty

of divine light yield wondrous fragrance.\n\n**—Changle, Chen Tang**\nJade palaces mark the finest scenes,\nThe turtle’s back—stone firm and steadfast.\nIn times of peace, the divine and numinous

surpass,\nHonored with seals and bathed in imperial favor.\n\n**Dragon Pool Flying Waterfall**　　　　　*Bai Lake, Guo Yi*\nRain gathers over the immortal’s summit,\nFlying torrents bear the ancient pool’s waters.\nAt night, the twin streams’ descent is heard,\nBy dawn, they merge into a single brook.\nReflections invert the Silver River at dusk,\nVoices hang in the azure sky of autumn.\nHigh-dwelling cranes startle from their dreams,\nMysterious rainbows rise from hidden depths.\nDistant echoes—sparse bell tones,\nOne might mistake them for drifting white silk.\nAt Turtle Peak’s clear listening post,\nThe moon lingers in the *Step-in-Void* tower.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nThe numinous pool, drenched by night’s rain,\nThe flying waterfall pours from the bright river.\nClearing skies polish the ice-like mirror,\nCold sounds emerge from the creeping fig.\nScattered pines startle the cranes’ dreams,\nWinding shores carry the fishermen’s songs.\nBeware the moon at the stream’s edge—\nHow many times have true immortals passed here?\n\n**—Diaotai, Li Pu**\nBehold the Six Harmonies’ transformative work—\nCarved by heaven’s craft, winding and vast.\nThe hibernating spirit’s qi,\nThe pool’s secrets,\nThe Primordial’s Silver River descends from the sky’s edge.\nA thousand-foot rainbow hangs inverted,\nAbove, it joins the Milky Way,\nBelow, it flows into the river’s course.\nCool shadows, beauty,\nNew moon’s chill,\nVoices echo in the sparse wind—true immortals.\nAt dawn, they offer libations and sing pure odes,\nWho could share in this?\n\n**—Qingmen, Shao Tong**\nAfter the fresh rain, the numinous pool’s leisurely mood abounds,\nA hundred-foot flying torrent spills from the celestial river.\nSoaring through clouds, it seems to trail jade silk,\nBeneath the moon, one might mistake it for scattered jade pendants.\nSuddenly, it stirs the depths of the hidden pool’s listening,\nThen startles the wild geese flying past the sun’s edge.\nAt dawn, ascending the golden turtle to gaze,\nIt scatters into Penglai’s jade-green sea waves.\n\n**—Changle, Chen Tang**\nA thousand-foot cold torrent descends the cloud ladder,\nAs if the jasper vault exhales a white

favor.\n\n**—Diaotai, Li Pu**\nAt Green Marsh, the tide first ebbs,\nEvening rain arrives on the river.\nWave-light pure as if washed,\nTen thousand acres without a speck of dust.\nStone roots thick with reeds and rushes,\nSandbanks where wild ducks and egrets guess.\nBoats moored on both banks’ narrows,\nThe path turns where clustered peaks open.\nDredged not by Yu’s hand,\nTributary waters return eastward on their own.\nThe Canglang’s fisherman sings,\nMoonlit nights encircle the immortal’s terrace.\n\n**—Longxi, Li Shuyi**\nGreen Marsh, a place for wandering chants,\nVast and overflowing, the early tide returns.\nBoats lie where fragrant grasses bend,\nSand meets the distant great river.\nCurving banks, empty pools, and Wu Isle,\nA perilous rainbow hangs from the stone bridge.\nFrom here, the immortal’s path reaches,\nHow many times has one sailed the layered clouds?\n\n**—Qingmen, Shao Tong**\nDistant islets, vast and hazy, the sun not yet dim,\nThe returning tide, a single band, seems to know its source.\nIn clear light, white egrets leave traces on the sand,\nAt dusk, green moss is washed clean, revealing stone marks.\nSuddenly entering the limpid river, it still keeps faith,\nYet dividing the blue sea, all words fail.\nWatching the waves, I ascend the turtle peak’s summit,\nWhere does the tributary flow that is Yu’s gate?\n\n**—Changle, Chen Tang**\nA traveler nears Green Marsh,\nClouds guide the receding tide far off.\nStrange trees hang over the embankment,\nLeisurely gulls stand on shallow sand.\nNets gather, the many fishermen done,\nSails drop, a single boat tilts.\nWaiting to see the tide fill (missing character),\nOne should ride the Buwang’s raft.\n\n**Travelers at South Pond** — *Baihu, Guo Yi*\nDistant and winding, the South Pond’s road,\nCoiling past the Taiyi Palace.\nEndless mountains to behold,\nPassing travelers’ thoughts know no bounds.\nHomeland beyond floating clouds,\nPasses and rivers in the setting sun.\nMarten-fur meets Ji Zha,\nHorse’s head turns toward Liang Hong.\nLodging like geese before frost,\nStartled like tumbleweed on the sea.\nThe thoroughfare from here extends,\nWho asks of weeping east or west?\n\n**—Diaotai, Li Pu**",

      "translated_text": "**Fujian’s Wealth in Mountains and Seas** — *Li Shuyi of Longxi*\nFujian abounds in mountains and seas,\nMerchants vie in haste and drive.\nCeaselessly they cross for profit,\nComing and going by South Pond’s edge.\nLike tumbleweed they sigh for old traces,\nLike duckweed they fear new acquaintances.\nAt dusk they gaze toward hearth-smoke,\nCold wind stirs their temples’ threads.\nHomeland lies far in the heart’s inch,\nA lone cloud grieves parting’s sorrow.\nIn the gourd, sun and moon stretch long—\nThey should mock the world’s mad pursuit.\n\n**Southern Fujian’s Post Roads** — *Li Shuyi of Longxi*\nSouthern Fujian’s post roads connect,\nMerchants race for gain’s swift crossing.\nLean horses startle at the cold’s passage,\nLight carriages drift with the shifting moon.\nA traveler’s heart leaves duckweed traces,\nA sojourner’s tears mourn sea and sky.\nThey imagine immortals’ joy,\nVainly pitying the floating world’s folly.\n\n**Travel Thoughts at South Pond** — *Shao Yong of Qingmen*\nTraveler’s thoughts linger where South Pond’s wild waters run deep,\nWillows in mist, green shadows dense.\nWho among homeland kin and friends remains well?\nOn parting roads, orioles and blossoms weary lone recitation.\nGeese vanish, the heart clings to the moon over Green Marsh,\nThe sky empties, the gaze follows white clouds on the peak.\nHalting the carriage, one should seek the true immortal’s realm—\nA single inquiry of their voice outweighs ten thousand gold.\n\n**Endless Traffic at South Pond** — *Chen Tang of Changle*\nCarriages and riders throng, departing and returning,\nSouth Pond’s road leads into green mountains.\nFragrant herbs may be gathered, fish may be hooked—\nWhy then toil endlessly without pause?\n\n**Wood Ridge’s Woodcutter Songs** — *Baihu, Guo Yi*\nWood Ridge spans the mountain’s crest,\nHeaven’s wind brushes the grass-clad robe.\nWhere clouds gather, one recites while walking,\nReturning at dusk with a resonant song.\nA wild temple’s bell just fades,\nHouseholds half-close their doors.\nA few notes of autumn stretch vast,\nA single melody under the faint moon.\nWho recognizes the rotting axe-handle?\nThe mountain’s hush hears few listeners.\nPassing on, they say, the Tortoise Peak’s summit—\nAn old crane offers pure insight.\n\n**Western Ridge Veiled in Cold** — *Diaotai, Li Pu*\nThe western ridge shrouds in chill hues,\nWood Ridge floats in evening’s shade.\nSeveral woodcutters return,\nTheir long songs strike the *shang* note.\nThe slow oar stirs the forest,\nA thousand crags’ leaves fall deep.\nDoors first seem stirred by yellow warblers,\nThen startle at the clear gibbons’ cries.\nThe jade stream blends with secluded listening,\nWhite clouds harmonize with the plain heart.\nEthereal, it joins immortal music,\nDescending southward to the moonlit peak.\n\n**Wood Ridge at Dawn** — *Li Shuyi of Longxi*\nWood Ridge brightens at clear dawn,\nWoodcutters’ songs cross emerald groves.\nFaint mountain mists darken,\nCascading ravine clouds deepen.\nStartled by the stream’s gibbons’ howls,\nAgain surprised by the wood-spirits’ chants.\nListening below the jade pavilion,\nThey mingle with distant *buxu* echoes.\n\n**Towering Wood Ridge** — *Shao Yong of Qingmen*\nLofty Wood Ridge rises above floating dust,\nWoodcutters climb tirelessly.\nLost in reading, they marvel at the late mountain hues,\nIn resonant song, they delight in the new moon’s glow.\nA few notes startle roosting pines’ cranes,\nA single tune hastens returning herb-gatherers.\nAt dusk, Tortoise Peak’s listening nears—\nOne seems to hear immortal pendants descending from the celestial ford.\n\n**Woodcutter’s Song** — *Dong Tang of Changle*\nWoodcutter’s song flows slow,\nWood Ridge’s thoughts sink deep.\nEscorting the sun, it follows flowing water,\nWinding through clouds, it emerges from distant woods.\nNesting cranes wake from dreams,\nCave-hidden dragons startle at the chant.\nA moment’s rest in the *Canglang* tune—\nHearing it, one’s lapels stir.\n\n**Bell Mountain’s Wild Goose Pagoda** — *Baihu, Guo Yi*\nA lone peak floats in purple-green,\nSeven tiers vie in lush bloom.\nLofty, it nears the dragon’s heaven,\nFar, it links the crow’s slanted path.\nInscribed names all belong to masters of state,\nInquiring kalpas equal river sands.\nIts shadow inverts in Vimalakirti’s chamber,\nIts incense divides from the Supreme One’s house.\nNight lamps kindle the *qi* tree,\nMorning seats fall with *udumbara* flowers.\nI admire those who came before,\nTheir fragrant names gleam on green gauze.\n\n**Bell Mountain Guards the True Realm** — *Diaotai, Li Pu*\nBell Mountain shields the true realm,\nStanding firm by the clear river’s bank.\nThe pagoda leans on layered heights,\nSeven tiers pierce the empty clouds.\nIts lofty mark emerges from the dusty world,\nIts splendid structure transcends earthly vapors.\nInscribed names link phoenix companions,\nFlying pendants arrive with crane flocks.\nLong have I cherished thoughts of purple mist,\nForever wishing to spread its numinous fragrance.\nUnable to ascend the cinnabar ladder,\nI vainly revere it at dawn’s glow.\n\n**Bell Mountain Circles the Sacred Ground** — *Li Shuyi of Longxi*\nBell Mountain encircles the precious land,\nThe Wild Goose Pagoda leans on layered heights.\nLamp shadows beyond autumn clouds,\nBell tones at the edge of evening glow.\nFragrant names mark the refined scholars,\nElegant chants gather in the dragon’s heaven.\nI often wish to seek its pure delight—\nIn what year may I renounce worldly ties?\n\n**Famed Mountain’s Sacred Tier** — *Shao Yong of Qingmen*\nThe famed mountain’s precious tier parts from worldly dust,\nFacing true immortals’ peaks and white clouds.\nA hundred blended incense fragrances drift far with the wind,\nNine heavens’ bells and chimes divide the night’s beginning.\nFlowered windows’ dharma words quiet the void,\nCassia registers’ names resound across the land.\nI intend to cherish one clear gaze toward a friend—\nAgain I hear the cold cries of geese leaving the flock.\n\n**The Seven-Tiered Pagoda** — *Chen Tang of Changle*\nThe seven-tiered pagoda gleams fresh,\nBell Mountain’s green peaks rise jagged.\nInscribed names since ancient times abound in talent—\nThey make those who came before awaken those who follow.\n\n*Collected Eulogies of Numinous Marvels, Scroll Four* — **End**",
