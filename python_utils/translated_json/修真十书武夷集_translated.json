  "full_translation": "**Preface to the Reconstruction of Zhi Zhi Hermitage in the Wuyi Mountains**\n*From the Forty-Fifth Scroll of the* Ten Books on Cultivating the Dao: Wuyi Collection, *by Bai Yuchan of Hainan*\n\nThe Wuyi Mountains, as recorded in the *Liexian Zhuan* of the Qin era, were where Qian Keng refined the elixir. Qian Keng presented pheasant broth to Emperor Yao, who enfeoffed him at Pengcheng; later, he was called Peng Zu, living to seven hundred and seventy-seven years before passing. Throughout his life, he concealed himself in the Wuyi Mountains, consuming lingzhi and drinking from waterfalls, able to ride the wind and command qi, soaring through the void—was he not a transcendent? Keng had two sons: the elder named Qian Wu, the younger Qian Yi, whence the name Wuyi Mountains derived.\n\nAt the first bend of the Nine Bends Stream, the head of the thirty-six peaks, the earliest curve of the land, the Celestial Matriarch of Taimu first built her hut there, followed by Zhang Zhan, who entered her chamber to continue her work. Later, the female adepts Yu Daochao and Yu Daoyuan of the Qin era retreated here to seclude themselves. The place was so secluded as to be indescribable, surrounded by thickets of bamboo. Those who came to gather firewood and glimpsed them called them the \"Hairy Women\" after the bamboo, a name that endures to this day.\n\nDuring the Jin, Lou Shizhong, and in the Tang, Xue You, both refined their essence and nurtured their primordial qi here before departing. In our dynasty, it is said that Li Taozhen of Dongjing, Li Tiedi of Luobin, and Li Mojing of Yanshan successively built their hermitages here. Chancellor Li Gang once sought out these three Lis, confirming a dream of snow from his past, intending to construct a \"Hermit’s Pavilion for Officials\" here. Thereafter, generations of nuns resided in the hermitage, naming it Chan Hermitage and the site Chan Cliff.\n\nAlas! Extraordinary figures appear but rarely in the world, and the hermitage fell into ruin, the land overgrown with brambles. Only the name \"Zhi Zhi\" remained, its origins lost to time.\n\nZhan Meizhong, styled Meizhong, a descendant of generations of scholar-officials and a man of heroic spirit, sighed one day: \"Sima Qian explored the Nine Doubts, and Han Yu ascended Mount Taihua—both were moved by antiquity and sighed with emotion. Was this mere love of the strange? In this turbid world, the path of officialdom is fraught with obstacles. Why not cultivate friendships beyond the mundane and pursue the study of cinnabar and mercury? Perhaps one might ascend in flight or achieve liberation in death. The Dao of immortality can be sought—why not strive for it? I do not claim mastery, but I wish to learn.\"\n\nJust then, Bai Yuchan of Qiongzhou emerged from Min and Yue to arrive in Wuyi, harboring the intent to clear the brambles and hew the undergrowth. His aspirations resonated with Zhan Meizhong’s long-held thoughts. Together, they searched for the site of Zhi Zhi Hermitage, sweeping away centuries of untrodden moss and cutting through miles of creeping vines, until they found the place. In the spring of the bingzi year of the Jiading era, they gathered laborers and timber to begin construction.\n\nYet the difficulties of founding were great. Before long, Bai Yuchan departed for Tiantai and Yandang. Upon his return, the hermitage was completed. Meizhong wished to persuade him to stay, arranging the hermitage as a retreat for the three Lis. But Yuchan, wary of the comings and goings of officials in their crimson robes, with their carriages and steeds, which would disrupt his affairs and disturb his mind, said to Meizhong: \"The hermitage is complete thanks to your surplus wealth and effort. In the blink of an eye, halls and chambers have been erected—who but a master of thunderous skill could achieve this? Now, select those who are steadfast in the Dao, patient in spirit, content with simplicity, and fond of tranquility to reside here. Let them cultivate the land for a few seasons, and the flowers and trees will flourish. As for me, I shall enter seclusion on Luofu Mountain, but I will return to reside here permanently.\"\n\nMeizhong replied, \"So be it.\" Then he said, \"Since you are leaving first, will you not write a record of this hermitage for me, to pledge your return in the future?\"\n\nYuchan replied, \"Very well.\"\n\nThis hermitage leans against Manting Peak, faces Huxiao Rock, with Tianzhu Peak to its left and Tieguai Peak to its right. A few steps inward lies Zhu Xi’s Hall of Humaneness and Wisdom; a single call outward reaches the Temple of the True Assembly of Prince Wei. Nearby stands Chongyou Abbey, with its hundreds of corridors and dozens of storied pavilions, their jade tablets and brocade cases filled with imperial calligraphy, their jeweled caskets and jade coffers storing the remains of immortals. The great monastery of the Golden Body of Great Cloud stands beside Zhi Zhi Hermitage.\n\nBehind it, waterfalls cascade from cliffs a thousand fathoms high, like melting snow; before it, the emerald stream brims with waters where dragons bathe. Above lies the Heaven-Mirroring Pool, which connects to the Weak Waters; below lies the Cave of Ascending Perfection, which leads to Penglai. Among the thousand peaks and ten thousand ravines of Wuyi, the myriad mountains and rivers—none surpass the splendor of Zhi Zhi Hermitage.\n\nHere, clouds veil jade grottoes, mist shrouds gemstone forests; purple cypress seals cinnabar, clear springs wash jade. Gibbons follow feathered adepts, cranes cry over fields of lingzhi. A single note from an iron flute gathers the immortals of the grass; three cups from a conch shell evoke the ethereal strains of celestial hymns. Truly, one may sing the hymns of the Purple Void or chant the immortal melodies of jade-winged transcendents. Dust does not obscure the eye; past and present are but a moment. The affairs of the crimson canopy and rainbow bridge remain vivid as ever.\n\nHow wondrous! Green grass, green; a hundred birds sing. Here, one may play the qin at dusk or compose poetry at leisure. Wine may be drunk while gazing at the scenery; without verse, the heart still finds its song. Where do the immortals dwell, so distant and elusive? The Lord of Wuyi resides on the northern slope of the mountain. A lone boat plies the waters, returning whence it came; where to seek the jade flowers that fill the grotto?\n\nIs this not the most secluded and sublime place of Zhi Zhi Hermitage?\n\nZhan Meizhong surely knows that the Jade Emperor will host another banquet, and Bai Yuchan will refine the elixir of seven returns and nine reversions. This text is not written in vain.\n\nShould future days bring extraordinary events, they shall but affirm that Zhi Zhi Hermitage was not built in vain.\n\nI recall that in the flourishing years of Yuanyou, a man erected a thatched hut on Huotong Mountain, calling it Jiji. Within a few years, the builder had already shed his mortal form, and the hut itself vanished. Later, during the Longxing era, another sought to restore it; within a year or two, this restorer encountered the original founder—both then ascended as immortals. Such tales are recorded in *Accounts of Immortals Gathered*.\n\nNow, the affairs of Meizhong bear a striking resemblance. For \"zhi zhi\" signifies \"to halt where one ought to halt\"—an idea echoed in the *Zhouyi*'s *Gen* hexagram, which embodies the meaning of twin mountains. This principle elucidates the doctrine of \"zhi zhi,\" while the *Lotus Sutra* speaks of \"zhi zhi, wondrous and beyond thought,\" and Zhuangzi declares: \"An empty chamber gives birth to brightness; auspiciousness resides in *zhi zhi*.\" Thus, across the Three Teachings, *zhi zhi* holds profound significance.\n\nConsider still water as a mirror, the moon as the object of contemplation. One may chant poems of the Six *Zhi*s or compose rhapsodies of the Eight *Zhi*s—indeed, there are those who embody this principle in full. The name *Zhi Zhi* was not idly chosen in antiquity, nor is the hermitage’s revival in our time without purpose. Surely one who has deeply grasped *zhi zhi* now dwells within its walls.\n\nFor green mountains and white clouds are nothing but *zhi zhi*; fallen blossoms and flowing streams are likewise *zhi zhi*. The cries of birds and mournful apes, the desolate moss and broken lichen—all embody the meaning of *zhi zhi*. Those yet unable to attain *zhi zhi* may study under one who has already realized it, for in every action—walking, standing, sitting, or lying—there exists an unceasing *zhi*, far beyond the mere chatter of withered wood or cold ashes.\n\nI, too, am one of the *zhi zhi* company. In recording the people of this hermitage, I join them in entering the *zhi zhi* samadhi, offering reverence to the Three Pure Ones of the Highest Heaven and guiding all beings to realize *zhi zhi*.\n\n*Zhi zhi* is not the cessation of *zhi*, but rather the cessation of the cessation of *zhi*—nothing more.\n\nInscribed by Bai Yuchan of Hainan.\nComposed by Zhan Meifu, descendant of Manting of the former wilderness, and great-grandson of Guifeng.\n\nTo Master Zhi of the Palace, Wang Nanji of the Cave Chapters\n\nThe ancient *Xi Ce* states: \"The southern flight of the *geng* hides in repose.\"\nJust as the sunlit scholar-tree sways in the balmy breeze,\nthe cicadas’ evening clamor stills at the Jade Luminous Palace.\n\nI look up to the Palace Master, a true person—\nhis bearing the grace of rivers and mountains,\nhis heart the vastness of wind and moon.\nA person among immortals, rarely met.\n\nOnce, I gathered the old records of the herb-gathering immortals’ lineage:\nWang Qi was the bright disciple of Lao Cong’s kindling,\nWang Nan the kindred spirit of Zhuang Zhou’s sealed casket.\nIn the boundless heavens of Yushan, Wang Yong wielded thunder’s peak;\nin the Brahma-guardian heavens of Xuyan, Wang Shao discerned the workings of fate.\nThe man of Lu, Wang Shuo, refined the jade-cloud elixir on Floating Jade Mountain;\nthe man of Qin, Wang Qiao, tempered the nine-spirit elixir in Heavenly Flower Cave.\nLater came Wang Chang and Wang Min in the Han and Jin,\nWang Mao and Wang Zaiqing in the Wei and Tang.\nIn recent times, Cloud Crane Master composed the *Three-One Numinous Chapters*,\nSmoke Pine Master the *Pivotal Essentials of the Golden Elixir*,\nCarefree Master the *Collected Works of the Returned Elixir*,\nPure Emptiness Master the *Guide to the Dao of the Elixir*—\nall of their kin.\n\nTheir gates have seen immortals and humans appear and vanish, scarcely one or two.\nYet it is said: the phoenix of cinnabar mountains must hatch from the *luan* and *chi*;\nthe steed of crimson marshes must sire the *qilin*.\nSo it is with the unbroken line of immortal descendants—\nillustrious immortals and perfected beings emerge in succession,\nand after a thousand or a hundred years, a true person arises,\npresiding over the grotto-heaven,\ncelestial regalia at his side,\nnurturing the essence of heaven,\nupholding and illuminating the profound mysteries.\nHe chews the essence of the Great Primal,\ngathers the *qi* of the True One.\n\nIn governing his mind, he is like an image in a mirror;\nin responding to the world, he is like the moon in water.\nHis merit and virtue resplendent,\noutshining all before and after—\nthe world’s Daoists and layfolk alike\nclasp hands and bow their heads,\neyes straining to see, hands pointing,\nall exclaiming:\n\"Such is his Dao, such is his virtue!\"\n\nThus, I compose these Cave Chapters to sing of him.\n\nThe Song says:\n\nA single pearl of the Yellow Dao coils ‘round the gate-tower,\nthe square-inch heart empty, the grotto-door sealed.\nMulberry fields remain unchanged while the sea’s waters recede;\njade trees bloom, their green leaves lush and deep.\n\nThe Lesser Grotto’s jade missives fall upon dragon and tiger;\nwho presides over the moonlit altar’s fragrant chimes?\nThe Perfected One soars down on a divine simurgh,\nheavenly escorts, somber-faced, return to the Purple Palace.\n\nA thousand peaks, ten thousand peaks lock in azure mist;\nthree trees, two trees—where gibbons cry their last.\nWind scatters willow catkins in the third-month chill;\na man stands at the city gate, a misty riverside village.\n\nBorn with divine spirit, ever majestic,\nhe laughs, carrying off a scroll of the *Yellow Court*.\nSeated in the jade palace, he rules over gruel of jade,\nstar-caps and rosy skirts fill the hall’s eaves.\n\nFrom across the four seas, incense-bearing pilgrims arrive like candles,\ncrawling on elbows and knees, they come like clouds.\nThe Love River’s waves stretch boundless,\nflowers bloom on iron pillars in the City of Darkness’ spring.\n\nGrasping yin and yang in a single breath,\nhis long whistle makes ghosts and gods weep.\nWielding his sword, he summons rain with a flick of his ring;\ninscribing talismans, he calls forth thunder with a stroke of his brush.\n\nIn those years, he was summoned to the inner Daoist sanctuary,\nyellow hemp and purple ink vied in brilliance like stars.\nReturning, a hundred neglected tasks were joyfully restored,\nthe grand design, resplendent, was laid out anew.\n\nRecalling the first kalpa of the Dragon Han,\nhe shattered the Primordial’s baggage of delusion.\nA cauldron full of lead-frost, flames soaring—\ndo you know, sir, of green cheeks and snowy teeth?\n\nPines and bamboos sigh in the clear wind,\na white crane departs, the thatched hut left empty.\n\n**Visiting the Immortal: A Gift of Ten Thousand Records**\nThe idle brush, the flying reeds—just as the first key turns,\nthe Blue Maiden still precedes, the night’s journey fraught with peril.\nFor days on end, the east wind brings biting cold,\nthe oriole’s song fades, plum blossoms fall.\n\nA guest arrives at Wuyi, seeking traces of the divine,\nthe Eight-Character Grotto’s door unlocked, no bolt in place.\nLast night’s rain swelled the stream’s head;\npeach petals fill the brook, red and glowing.\n\nGreen moss carpets the ground, evenly spread,\nfragrant grasses stand silent, mist veiling all.\nThe pounding of herbs echoes, the Elixir Well runs dry,\na rainbow bridge snaps, the rosy curtain drawn.\n\nThe ancient pine wind mimics the phoenix flute,\nas dusk falls, clear guests fill the valleys and peaks.\nMountain light stills, the old pines and bamboos unchanged,\nwithin the grotto, a somber air—gibbons and cranes grieve.\n\nThe loom-rock study stands empty,\nthe Purple Ridge’s cinnabar mounds long desolate.\nMist darkens the level woods, tigers roar,\na jade-green pool blooms, an old dragon leaps.\n\nSteep cliffs—birds dare not fly past,\nten-thousand-foot emerald cliffs, sheer and towering.\nThe golden toad in the mountains cannot be found;\nby the rocks, pluck and chew yellow mushrooms.\n\nMy life drifts carefree, untethered,\nin springs and stones, mist and clouds, I find true joy.\nClad in green hemp, a green bamboo hat,\na jade staff slung across my shoulder, I tread the brambled peaks.\n\nI love only the mountains and forests, bearing the weight of cities,\nyet scorn fine foods, preferring wild greens.\nWith a cold eye, I lie on stone, entering the realm of *Huaxu*;\nI dream of the Great Void, untouched by axe or chisel.\n\nEntering the grotto, not half an hour passes,\nyet in the blink of an eye, ten days and nights have gone.\nToday, the rain’s feet retreat from the cloud-tops;\nI long to return, yet the mountains and streams bind me.\n\nI wish to build three thatched huts here,\nbreakfast on rosy clouds, drink from the waterfall’s spray.\nFate has already allotted me a share of the divine;\nI know beyond the Dao, there is no heaven and earth.\n\nYet I fear heaven’s many offices—\neven when the nine-fold elixir is complete, I dare not swallow.\n\n**Song of the Immortals in the Painting**\nBefore the wine of Sun Quan is drained,\nthe painter’s brush hovers, poised to leave the silk.\nA single dot of congealed ink resembles a living fly—\nwhen scraped, it does not fly; the heart startles in surprise.\n\nXianzhi, inspired, lifts his brush—\nthe brush seems to fly, tracing its own lines.\nPlayfully, he stains pine-soot to make a cow,\nits horns laid back, it sleeps on the mossy mound.\n\nXiao Bi grasps the crane’s essence,\nhis heart unobstructed by creation’s bounds.\nA plain silk scroll becomes a slice of sky,\nsnowy feathers poised to rise, piercing the azure mist.\n\nMonk Guan, drunk, sleeps soundly;\nawakening, he dips his brush, makes stone blocks.\nHe splits mountains, rips rocks, lifting clouds,\nnow like a crouching tiger, now like a raised fist.\n\nKai’s painted orchids hide jade shoots—\nwhen opened, they have already flown away.\nHow to make emerald leaves form a chilly thicket,\nfour seasons ever wafting spring’s breeze?\n\nI hear that in the Southern Studio, Yuwen Huan\nwith his skilled brush and wondrous ink sweeps away reed-warts.\nNeck lowered to drink, neck raised to fly,\nhe captures the lotus withered, the sand bar lean.\n\nIn the Tang, the recluse Wu Daozi\nbeyond his paintings of immortals, often drew gibbons.\nHe depicted them clutching their young, falling to cold springs,\nor like a drawn bow, racing toward distant trees.\n\nJi Cheng’s painted tigers are always fierce,\nghosts and gods dare not meet their gaze.\nOne sees only the paper come alive with ferocity,\nan open mouth howls, the wind wails in sorrow.\n\nLord Ye loved dragons, so he learned to paint them—\nunaware, his heart’s aperture opened a jar.\nNo sooner had the brushstrokes on paper resembled a dragon,\nthan wind-whiskers and wave-manes vied in might.\n\nHan Gan painted horses, capturing their essence,\nfrost’s whinny artfully rendered in a galloping pose.\nPitiful, their open mouths neigh soundlessly,\nonly the wind’s edges carve their emaciated bones.\n\nBy the riverbank, for whom do the fine grasses grow green?\nOnly the wind and mist keep them in check.\nRuan Xian gathers the spirit of grasses,\nhis brush’s tip privately brings them spring.\n\nOf old, Kang Lingzhu painted fish,\ntossing heads, wagging tails, a myriad scales complete.\nRed-finned purple carp swim in formation,\nshattering agate ice, leaping onto frozen surfaces.\n\nRen Lao’s heart held snow and moon—\nhis painted plum blossoms even more pristine.\nLu Zhi sniffed them, complaining of no fragrance,\nyet they conjure the misty rivers and lakes of Jiangnan.\n\nZhang Zhen, humble in heart, studied bamboo,\nwind and rain rustling, born on brocade scrolls.\nWind-swept branches, rain-soaked trunks seem to transform into dragons—\nunfit to be cut as staffs to aid Ge Hong.\n\nQian Jin painted pines, sweeping away mist and rain,\npine tips stand like cranes, never flying away.\nDefying wind, proud in snow—how long?\nTheir emerald hue unchanged, ever fresh and rare.\n\nWang Wei’s brush brims with mountains and waters,\na thousand peaks, ten thousand streams—all in a flick of the wrist.\nMyriad acres of glassy azure seem to flow,\nlayers of kingfisher green float upon the waves.\n\nAt times, he paints a few withered trees,\na single slice of sunset glow queries the flying duck.\nAt times, he paints an ancient ravine’s spring,\nrolling waves, unheard by men.\n\nAt times, flowers fall where crows cry—\njust as a thousand woods mourn autumn’s rain.\nAt times, dusk arrives, crows caw—\nat the mist’s edge, temple bells hasten the moon’s delay.\n\nAt times, he shifts the banks of Xiao and Xiang,\nrelocating them to Dongting’s shores, Pengli’s banks.\n\nAt times, he transplants the peaks of Tiantai,\nfacing Yadang’s chilly mist and rain.\nSince the ancients departed, none have learned—\nthose who study grasp but the husk.\n\nGhosts and spirits are easy; dogs and horses hard—\nthe world’s artisans glimpse not even a speck.\nYet in your red-and-ink, brush and water,\nyou carve from the heart what the mind has painted.\n\nOne stroke refined, a hundred strokes refined—\nleaving for posterity an undying name.\n\nZhuo’an, laughing, leans on a staff of plum,\na worldly immortal, this clumsy master.\nCrown and tablet cast aside, he leaves the jade gates,\nheaven’s men escort him to rule the Lin Palace.\nHis body dwells where stars and dew converge,\nhis heart abides in misted cities, moonlit courts.\n\nNot that he rubs his hands till they darken—\nno elixirs needed, his face glows crimson.\nA century yields but a tenth of dullness,\nall things reckoned—all is emptiness.\n\nHe sees through the spider’s vain web-spinning,\nthe parrot’s speech trapped in its cage.\nLeisurely he savors the world’s flavors in stillness,\nquietly he fathoms heaven’s secrets in silence.\n\nTo learn cunning is not so fine as to hide it;\nto forget the mechanism differs from wielding it.\nThe void speaks not, yet the void is vast;\ncreation makes no sound, yet creation is just.\n\nThe Six Thieves find no purchase in his idleness,\nthe Ten Demons grow lazy attacking him.\nGathering spirit, he gains the power of feigned stupidity;\ncultivating qi, he masters the art of silence.\n\nTo summon rain, he need only call the flood’s echo;\nto rouse thunder, he but invokes the numinous cavern.\nIf this world will not suffer him to stay,\nhe will learn to ride the white crane on the wind of heaven.\n\n*True Cultivation: Wuyi Anthology, Scroll Forty-Five* (end)\n*True Cultivation: Wuyi Anthology, Scroll Forty-Six*\n\n**In Praise of the Lineage of Celestial Masters**\n*By Bai Yuchan of Hainan*\n\n**The First Celestial Master, Lord of Orthodox Unity and Serene Response,**\nnamed **Daoling**, styled **Fuhan**:\nBefore Cloud-Brocade Mountain, he refined the Great Elixir,\nand the demons of the Six Heavens shivered to their bones.\nOnce he rode the crane back to the Mystic Bureau,\nmist and rain whispered over the Jade Altar.\n\n**The Second Celestial Master, Successor,**\nnamed **Heng**, styled **Lingzhen**:\nIn the early years of *Guanghe*, the Great Elixir was perfected—\nwhat skill did he lack to serve the Han’s numinous spirits?\nAt midnight, his jade chariot soared through purple dew,\nwhile spring winds and rains filled Yangping.\n\n**The Third Celestial Master, Heir,**\nnamed **Lu**, styled **Gongqi**:\nLaughing, he cast aside the bronze seal as governor of Hanzhong,\nhiding in the mountains, exchanging a peck of rice for divine might.\nWhen Wei troops encamped along the riverbanks,\nwith a flick of his finger, waves surged into a thousand-foot peak.\n\n**The Fourth,**\nnamed **Zi**, styled **Yuanwei**:\nLeaning on his staff, he climbed to the summit of Boyang’s cliffs,\nwhere an old alchemical furnace still locked in evening mist.\nThrough the ages, a pair of dragon-and-tiger stones remained—\nin what year did the Vice Minister ascend as an immortal?\n\n**The Fifth,**\nnamed **Zhaocheng**, styled **Daorong**:\nFrom thousands of miles away, his radiant spirit shone,\nwhile cinnabar ashes chilled and purple clouds congealed.\nTwo tigers returned to the forest, unseen by men;\na few stalks of fungus sprouted where cranes pierced the tomb.\n\n**The Sixth,**\nnamed **Jiao**, styled **Dexin**:\nJade slips of alchemical script hid in a latticed casket,\ncloud-desks flew through the air, cranes trailed their plumes.\nAfter bidding his disciples farewell and departing,\na pale moon fell into the cold pool that night.\n\n**The Seventh,**\nnamed **Zhonghui**, styled **Dechang**:\nIn those years, he fasted and refined the immortal elixir,\nsummoning rain and calling thunder as though in idle play.\nAcross the four seas, disciples received the register of the law—\nlaughing, he took his staff and left for Crane-Crying Mountain.\n\n**The Eighth,**\nnamed **Jiong**, styled **Yanchao**:\nThe moment his cinnabar talismans were inscribed, ghosts and gods wept;\nat ninety, he shed the red dust of the world.\nTo this day, where he built his hut on the cliff,\nphoenixes roost in the green bamboo at midnight.\n\n**The Ninth,**\nnamed **Fu**, styled **Dexin**:\nThe mountains and waters of Shangrao were the finest south of the Yangtze;\nhis monastic staff flew sideways, poised to build a hermitage.\nSuddenly, he met a perfected one beyond the mists—\nreturning speechless, he hid among the pines.\n\n**The Tenth,**\nnamed **Zixiang**, styled **Linbo**:\nAs the night deepened, his chamber filled with divine light,\nand the sacred elixir materialized in his palm.\nBeyond the tomb, cranes cried at that moment—\nonly rainbow robes remained to shroud the jade coffin.\n\n**The Eleventh,**\nnamed **Tong**, styled **Zhongda**:\nFor forty years, he shut his door and concentrated his spirit;\na green phoenix and red simurgh bore his cloud-borne carriage.\nFor months, his jade coffin held a golden body, translucent—\nhis chamber brimmed with celestial fragrance, a single cup of wine.\n\n**The Twelfth,**\nnamed **Zhongchang**, styled **Derun**:\nSummoned by crane-script to the imperial capital,\nhe returned to divide his form and transform into a radiant being.\nLast night, drunk, he spewed wine—\nawakening, he sipped again from the jar’s spring brew.\n\n**The Thirteenth,**\nnamed **Guang**, styled **Dezhao**:\nFor years, he fasted and studied flight,\npiercing the autumn sky with a single speck of blue.\nAs dusk fell over the forest on a wind-and-moonlit night,\nthe *Step-in-Void* chant echoed faintly from the grotto-heaven.\n\n**The Fourteenth,**\nnamed **Cizheng**, styled **Ziming**:\nHis alchemical crucible could dry quicksilver to life,\nand with a single thought, he fed the poor of his household.\nIn the void, he struck up the *Cloud-Soaring* music—\nwhite cranes arrived amid the wind and rain of spring.\n\n**The Fifteenth,**\nnamed **Gao**, styled **Shilong**:\nOn the Elixir Terrace, a jade-bearded elder—\nthe Celestial Master Zhang Shilong through the ages.\nHe toyed with rivers and mountains in poetic art,\nexhaling and inhaling wind and moon in wine’s divine power.\n\n**The Sixteenth,**\nnamed **Yingshao**, styled **Zhifeng**:\nAlone, he tilled a field of idle clouds,\nhis thatched hut silent as he recited the *Yellow Court*.\nLater, he spoke of fasting and returning to the mountains—\non moonlit nights, the sound of an iron flute was heard.\n\n**The Seventeenth,**\nnamed **Shun**, styled **Zhongfu**:\nA magistrate of Guixi, he hid in his mountain home,\nquietly building a thatched hut with two or three idle days.\nOn the day of his corpse-liberation at ninety,\npeople still saw him with the face of a youth.\n\n**The Eighteenth,**\nnamed **Shiyuan**, styled **Zhongliang**:\nIn the Jade Pool of divine water, he reared white crows;\nin the jade furnace, he stoked the fire to congeal cinnabar.\nThe immortals’ wondrous arts went unrecognized—\nin an instant, he could make peach and plum blossoms bloom.\n\n**The Nineteenth,**\nnamed **Xiu**, styled **Dezhen**:\nThe Jade Bureau’s jade scrolls bore dragon-and-phoenix script,\nand the Three Primes’ ordination drew scholars like clouds.\nTurning, he trod the path

**Wenfu**:\nA golden tortoise entered his belly in a dream, leaving him perplexed—\nin the jade chamber, a banished immortal was born.\nFor over a hundred years, the elixir passed through the ancestral seal;\nwhen he took up the tablet to return to the immortals, the earth quaked.\n\n**The Twenty-Second,**\nnamed **Shan**, styled **Yuanchang**:\nHe visited famous mountains and paid homage to grotto-heavens,\nonly to meet living immortals along the way.\nOn the day he returned, his bones transformed and his yang revived—\ncounting on his fingers, ninety years had passed in the mortal world.\n\n**The Twenty-Third,**\nnamed **Jiwen**, styled **Zhonggui**:\nWith a jade bowl, he prayed over water, stirring waves and clouds;\nbeneath his brush, thunder roared, making ghosts and gods weep.\nBefore and behind Dragon-Tiger Mountain,\nhow many had the Master brought back to life?\n\n**The Twenty-Fourth,**\nnamed **Zhengsui**, styled **Baoshen**:\nHe dwelled in the misty waters of plows and harrows,\nbuilding a thatched hut beyond the high pines.\nBestowed the title *True Serenity Master*—\none lane of immortal scriptures, one stove of incense.\n\n**The Twenty-Fifth,**\nnamed **Qianyao**:\nGrasping his *zhenna* staff, he entered the grotto-heaven,\nwhere the grotto-heaven lay vast, veiled in cold mist.\nEmperor Renzong personally inquired about the golden elixir’s secret—\nlaughing, he pointed to the slanting sun and the clamor of cicadas.\n\n**The Twenty-Sixth,**\nnamed **Sizong**:\nIn a cinnabar crucible, he refined golden essence,\nsilently praying to the

Ashamed of my own foolishness, I confess my lapses in discipline and virtue.\n\nScholars from the four directions flock like ox hairs in multitude. If I were to universally receive and instruct them in the Dao and virtue, I fear the leakage of celestial secrets. Yet if I were to reject them and startle them with precepts, I would obstruct and repel later learners. Should I select the worthy and exceptional to initiate one or two, I again worry that the mediocre might slip through, and the vulgar might approach with disdain.\n\nYour subject has long been favored by my teacher’s grace, having presumptuously received the profound mysteries of the Dao. I treasure and bear the heart-seal, never treating it lightly, reverently observing the precepts and prohibitions as though treading on thin ice, concealing my name and shunning fame. How could I, a mere youth with no knowledge of protecting my own feathers, dare to embellish my words? In truth and sincerity, on this auspicious day, I prostrate myself and present this memorial, offering it to the Three Heavenly Bureaus.\n\nAccording to the records of the disciples of the Supreme Three and Five Meritorious Works and the Orthodox Unity Alliance威, the devotees Shi and others have each already submitted their heart-vows to the Heavenly Court, beseeching transmission and initiation. Their petitions have been transcribed and submitted to the relevant departments, and in accordance with the statutes, certificates have been issued to confer upon them their ritual offices. A day was then chosen to establish the altar, split the talismans, break the contracts, assign generals, and command troops, dividing responsibilities and appointing officials. Thereafter, the elixir hall and jade scriptures were employed to transmit the heart-mantras and oral instructions.\n\nNow, with united sincerity, we respectfully select this day of the present month to ascend the Wuyi Mountains’ Ascendant True and Mysterious Transformation Grotto-Heaven, where we shall perform a several-part Pure Offering of Thanksgiving to the Lofty Perfected of the Three Realms, inviting the exalted Perfected to repay the mysterious creation, and further praying for blessings upon both our own persons and those of your subjects.\n\nIn my foolishness, I venture to present my humble insights to Your Celestial Majesty. There are seven great difficulties for those who practice the Dao, and six profound terrors—why is this so?\n\nFirst, the world’s customs are degenerate, moral teachings have collapsed, and the deluded point blindly at one another—this is the difficulty of encountering a true teacher, hence the first great difficulty.\n\nSecond, texts are riddled with errors, methods are contradictory, steps are misplaced in presentation, and phrases are omitted in measurement—this is the difficulty of obtaining the true method, hence the second great difficulty.\n\nThird, precepts and prohibitions are strict and clear, statutes are stern and solemn, yet they are hard to practice and easy to violate, leading many to stray from the truth—this is the difficulty of upholding the true precepts, hence the third great difficulty.\n\nFourth, the alchemical fire scorches harmony, lewd winds incite goodness to decay, the upright qi is severed and lost, and the primordial essence withers—this is the difficulty of preserving the true qi, hence the fourth great difficulty.\n\nFifth, the majestic demeanor of the exalted Perfected, the attire and colors of the divine generals, are hard to contemplate in the square inch of the heart, and a single impure thought disrupts them—this is the difficulty of maintaining true visualization, hence the fifth great difficulty.\n\nSixth, the celestial deities and earthly spirits, with their upright majesty, oversee merit and establish standards, scrutinizing even the finest detail—this is the difficulty of cultivating a true heart, hence the sixth great difficulty.\n\nSeventh, whether at dawn or dusk, in cold or heat, when urgent petitions arise, one must respond without daring to be negligent in seeking reward, and all the more must exert oneself—this is the difficulty of establishing true merit, hence the seventh great difficulty.\n\nAs for the six profound terrors: Should the transmitted scriptures, talismans, seals, and mantras be recklessly shown to the unworthy, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Wind-and-Thunder Hell, where blades will rend the body—this is the first profound terror.\n\nShould the received precepts be violated at inopportune times, and external defilements encroach, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Ash Pool Hell, where flames will brand the body—this is the second profound terror.\n\nShould one revere the Three Treasures and pay homage to the numinous Perfected without knowing the taboos, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Fire Net Hell, where wind-knives will torment the body—this is the third profound terror.\n\nShould the divine generals’ incense and fire be neglected day and night, and their summoning lack proper timing, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Frigid Ice Hell, where yellow ropes will bind the neck—this is the fourth profound terror.\n\nShould the mind be careless or heavy, affairs be handled with inconsistency, or one be diligent at times and lazy at others, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Iron Pellet Hell, where iron oxen will plow the tongue—this is the fifth profound terror.\n\nShould one’s practice of the Dao become manifest and bribes be offered, leading to greed and avarice, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Dark Hell, where myriad sufferings will assail the body—this is the sixth profound terror.\n\nWhen considering these seven great difficulties and six profound terrors, your subject’s shoulders shrink, his heart aches, and his nose stings. I, a single dull and mediocre man, rely entirely on the compassion of the Supreme, which permits your subjects to bare our livers and spill our gall, confessing our sins and faults, praying that any transgressions may be pardoned and absolved.\n\nRegarding the aforementioned disciples who have received the transmission, I humbly beseech Your Sagely Compassion to deign to issue a decree, granting my petition and entrusting it to the Supreme Mystery Capital Department for verification. The previous and subsequent submissions should then be promptly reported to all relevant offices and subordinate bureaus. I further pray for the command to dispatch the generals and marshals required in the Dao, who shall lead troops and command officials, arriving in due course at the ritual altars, incense halls, and administrative precincts of the ritual officers named so-and-so, where they shall station themselves to defend and protect, awaiting summons.\n\nWhen troops follow the seal’s command and generals proceed with the talisman’s authority, in every instance of ritual practice, they shall dispatch talismanic orders in accordance with the statutes. Through prayers and exorcisms, the great numinous efficacy shall be manifested, retributions shall be made clear, names shall be inscribed in the Jade Register, ranks shall be assigned to the Golden Roster, and they shall receive the authority to command troops and wield the power to oversee the governance of spirits and demons. They shall act as Heaven’s agents to transform, serve the state to save the people, slay demons, eliminate evil, and establish the upright.\n\nShould this be granted, I shall be both overjoyed and startled, spurring myself to diligence in body and mind, privately accumulating merit. When three thousand merits are complete and eight hundred deeds are perfected, I shall ascend to the immortal capital, awaiting promotion and selection. The ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears shall together attain good merit, and the six paths and three realms shall universally partake of good fruits.\n\nYour subject, in his foolishness, respectfully relies upon the Two Officials’ Direct Affairs Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Yin-Yang Divine Central Clerks, the Wind-Riding Courier Clerks, the Post-Horse Memorial Clerks, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry Clerks—two of each—to carry out their duties.\n\nFor the sake of the devotees Shi and others, who have advanced to the ritual altar for transmission and initiation, your subject presents this vermilion memorial of confession, thanksgiving, and petition, offering it to the Three Heavenly Bureaus. It is respectfully submitted to the Supreme Void Primordial Master’s Palace and the Supreme Clarity Bureau’s Purple Numen Palace, with the hope that it may be reported.\n\nWith utmost reverence and trepidation, your subject prostrates and kowtows, bowing twice to make this known.\n\nTo the Supreme Clarity Mysterious Origin Supreme Ultimate Great Dao Supreme Dao Lord, the Primordial Void Master, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Master, the Heavenly Emperor Lord, the Heavenly Emperor Master, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Nine Black Masters, the myriad layers of Daoist luminaries, the twelve hundred official lords, and the Jade Court of Supreme Clarity below: Your subject, surnamed Bai, a candidate for immortality selected by the Golden Portal and promoted as a presented scholar, now stationed at the southeastern corner of the Chongyou Abbey’s ritual altar, prostrates upon the earth to await your command.\n\nThis vermilion memorial of confession and thanksgiving is respectfully submitted by your disciple of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Precious Register, the Five Thunder Three Offices Judging Official, and the Director of the Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Demons, your subject Bai [so-and-so].\n\nWe humbly observe: when the purple simurghs cry beneath the moon and the Azure Sovereign unfurls feathered canopies at the Pivot Palace; when white cranes call to the clouds and the Red Emperor descends with rainbow banners at the Mechanism Lodge—we receive the Golden Portal’s edict of silk and bamboo and descend with the Jade Terrace’s covenant talismans, granting amnesty to the black-haired masses for their transgressions and averting calamities for the common folk. We prepare offerings of jujubes, chestnuts, cypress, and pine, gazing upward to the star altars of maple, locust, and willow. We establish the breaking of *jia* and *geng* days, discerning the configurations of *ce* and *kui*; we pace the *kan* and *li* of *zi* and *wu*, stepping through the rhythms of dark and new moons. With heartfelt words, we read aloud before the Dragon Countenance, praying that the Sagely Mind may deign to regard this humble ant-like memorial.\n\nWe reverently consider the Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Central Heaven Grand Emperor: Your Majesty’s Dao rivals that of the Primordial Beginning, and your virtue aligns with the August Heaven. From the misty palace, you govern with effortless grace; from the frosty terrace, you bestow ranks. The Radiant Yang Great Sage assists with the *Lian Zhen* and *Wu Qu* stars; the Yin Essence Luminous Lord collaborates with the *Wen Qu* and *Lu Cun* stars. You wield the handle of fortune and misfortune with clarity, and the power of life and death is concealed within the Hidden Origin. The *Po Jun* star holds the honored position of the Water Palace, while the Northern Culmen governs the administration of the celestial river. All misfortunes are dispelled, and all sins are confessed; no illness remains uncured, and no evil goes unvanquished.\n\nYour subject, the Daoist of Chongyou Abbey in Wuyi Mountain, Wufeng County, who oversees the ritual affairs of devotee Shi, has been graced to belong to humanity and fortunate to receive sagely transformation. Yet, born of mortal flesh and dwelling in the fiery prison of worldly toil, the six roots have incurred transgressions of desire and attachment, while the three karmas have led to the retributions of delusion. The eight trigrams have offended the directions and boundaries, and the five phases fear the changes of destiny’s cycles. The Three Officials pursue the soul, and the Four Bureaus record faults. Afflictions and misfortunes accumulate, illnesses and adversities linger. We now lay bare our foolish hearts and presumptuously beseech the Celestial Hearing.\n\nMay the radiance of jade illuminate and the brilliance of jasper shine forth. May the Spirit Kings of the Startled Ram expel the calamities of the life palace; may the Messengers of the *Tāluó* extend the years and repay the months’ vows. May the sixty officials of the Northern Dipper swiftly eradicate the seven harms and eight difficulties; may the seven thousand divine generals of the Southern Mound thunderously strike the nine perils and three disasters. Within the Dipper’s celestial bowl, may demonic influences be slain and disasters cease; beyond the steps of the Great Unity, may venomous toxins vanish without trace. May the Celestial Pass soar at dawn, and the Cinnabar Origin merge with the luminous scene. May the Dark and Mysterious expel the afflictions of epidemics, and the Jade Light extinguish the calamities of water and fire. May the assaults of malevolent spirits and earthly *qi* be repelled, and the arrows of the Life-Recording Turtle Lord be corrected. May the registers of Fengdu be erased, and the names in the Mountain Bureaus be removed. May the talismans of official misfortune, illness, and slander instantly perish; may the obstacles of retribution, karma, and affliction henceforth be driven away. May the healing officials of the Dharma bestow the medicines of the Six Dawns from the Brahma Palace; may the Heavenly Physicians descend the nine-times-refined elixirs from the Immortal Capital. May the five *qi* circulate freely, and the six pulses be at peace; may the three palaces ascend and descend, and the seven fluids flow harmoniously. May the constructive and defensive *qi* be tranquil, the meridians and collaterals unobstructed. May the *Gou Chen* conceal its luminous scene, and the Florid Canopy hide its form. We offer water and present flowers, our devotion boundless.\n\nWith our feet treading the earth and our heads touching the heavens, we pray for your mighty flood of blessings. We humbly present this memorial, earnestly awaiting your enlightened response.\n\nWith utmost reverence and trepidation, your subject prostrates and kowtows, respectfully submitting this memorial.\n\nOn a day in the first month of the ninth year of Jiading, the *bing-zi* year, your disciple of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Precious Register, the Five Thunder Three Offices Judging Official, and the Director of the Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Demons, your subject Bai, submits this memorial.\n\nYour subject, surnamed Bai, a candidate for immortality selected by the Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal and promoted as a presented scholar, now stationed at the ritual altar, prostrates upon the earth to await your command.\n\nThis vermilion memorial of confession, thanksgiving, and petition for transmission and initiation is respectfully submitted to the Orthodox Unity of the Great Mystery Capital, the Celestial Master of the Balanced *Qi* Lineage, the South Marchmount Master of the Qingwei Heavenly Transformed *Qi*, and the Perfected of the Red Emperor: the Vice Envoy of the Five Thunders of the Divine Empyrean Jade Mansion, and your disciple of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scriptures Register, your subject [so-and-so], kowtows twice and respectfully addresses this:\n\nWe humbly submit that memorials and petitions open the gates of confession and thanksgiving, while soaring spirits and riding *qi* pave the path to audience and reverence.\n\nThe transmission of the true and the initiation into the wondrous serve to inherit the wind of the Orthodox Unity; the advancement in rank and ascension in grade follow the method of recommendation and selection; the propagation of the Dao and the dissemination of transformation serve to expound the teachings of exorcism and salvation; the eradication of evil and the establishment of rectitude serve to uphold the Way of purity and forthrightness.\n\nIf this disciple may speak: when the heart’s square inch remains turbid, how can one grasp the clarity of the Dao? When the oral instructions and methods fail to manifest efficacy, how can one know the exorcistic and salvific power of the teachings? When words and deeds lack purity, how can one understand the laws of recommendation and selection? When the true and the false remain undistinguished, how can one recognize the wind of the Orthodox Unity? When form and spirit fail to merge in perfect harmony, how can one know the path of audience and reverence? When the deluded and foolish remain unenlightened, how can one comprehend the gates of confession and thanksgiving? Such are the unchanging principles.\n\nThis disciple has thus come to understand: only after purifying the heart and confessing one’s transgressions may one submit memorials and petitions; only after concentrating the mind and gathering the spirit may one soar in spirit and ride the *qi*; only after disciplining the heart and studying the Dao may one transmit the true and initiate the wondrous; only after rectifying the heart and sincerely aligning the will may one advance in rank and ascend in grade; only after dedicating the heart to benefiting all beings may one propagate the Dao and disseminate transformation; only after cleansing the heart and purifying the self may one eradicate evil and establish rectitude. Does Your Majesty deem this correct, or not?\n\nThe reason this disciple submits memorials and petitions arises from the vast and empty void, and as for soaring in spirit and riding the *qi*, there is no other cause—save that within this defiled and evil world, on behalf of Your Majesty, I have selected the worthy and chosen the virtuous, and among them, there is but one who, if initiated into the transmission of the true and the wondrous, may advance in rank and ascend in grade, propagate the Dao and disseminate transformation, eradicate evil and establish rectitude. Should there be even the slightest merit or the smallest virtue, it would suffice to slightly aid the governance of Heaven. Though this be this disciple’s achievement, it is entirely Your Majesty’s work.\n\nIn this manner, the Dao and its methods are glorified, and in this manner, the customs of the world are guided. Clearly manifest before the eyes and ears of humans and gods, a single memorial of tribute is presented, ascending to the Three Heavenly Bureaus. Reverently, for the Nine Purple Palaces of the Li Mansion, in the celestial region of the Dipper and Ox, in the Great Song Empire, the disciple [so-and-so], whose life is bound to the command of [such-and-such] and whose destiny is tied to [such-and-such] star, affiliated with the Celestial Master of [such-and-such] *qi* lineage in [such-and-such] realm, states: summoned by the Three Black Lords of the Middle Prime Festival, this day, with reverent offerings of incense and tokens, I kowtow and present myself at the Dao to make this declaration.\n\nI humbly reflect that, though undeserving, I have dwelt in this flourishing age and gained entry into the realm of the mysterious; though unworthy, I have been admitted to the ranks of the ordained and been fortunate to transmit the teachings and methods. Though I have diligently studied, I have yet to awaken to the numinous truth. Having had the good fortune to encounter a master’s guidance, I now bind my thoughts and prostrate myself in earnest, baring my heart and swearing an oath to Heaven. I beseech the transmission of the *Nine Numinous Flying Steps Memorial Method* of the celestial realm, that I may ascend in spirit and submit memorials, presenting myself in audience and reverence. Moreover, I sigh with self-reproach, for such rare opportunities are difficult to encounter. I also seek the transmission of the *Great Method of the Purple Pivot, Jade Dawn, Cavern Yang, and Flying Sanskrit Refining Salvation* of the Most High, to summon and command hidden spirits and perform the rites of refinement and salvation.\n\nHaving submitted this memorial, and having performed the rites of refinement, if there are exorcisms to be done, how shall efficacy be attained? I further request the transmission of the *Great Method of the Five Thunders of the Most High*, to pray for rain and beseech clear skies, to summon winds and call forth snow, to seal mountains and breach caves, to fell temples and expel evil, to sever dragons and subdue tigers, to drive away drought demons and sweep away locusts, to heal illnesses and avert disasters, to reward the good and punish the wicked. With utmost sincerity in every step and gesture, I vow to transmit the true oral instructions with a sincere heart.\n\nIn accordance with the words of this petition, no concealment is permitted. Previously, I had it transcribed and submitted to the Capital Bureau, and it has already been presented to the Celestial Court. Should my name be inscribed in the Jade Register, my rank will surely be recorded in the Golden Roster. A day shall be chosen to establish the altar and transmit the methods, following the rituals to dispatch generals and exchange troops, drinking the blood of the covenant and breaking the rings to sever the bonds. Yet I fear that at the moment of the oath and during the transmission, when I assess my own worth, I find my heart filled with shame. Should I, by some chance, profane the true and incur punishment, I have repeatedly presented my case before the Emperor to plead my circumstances. Considering this foolish and base one’s ignorance and transgressions, I rely on Your boundless mercy to grant forgiveness.\n\nThis disciple, burdened by the sins of seven lifetimes and the errors of three generations, beseeches the opening of the Gate of Immaculacy to allow a path for renewal. Pursuing the wondrous meaning of the true methods, I study to attain the state of the subtle and the imperceptible; refining stillness and concentrating emptiness, my heart naturally attains purity. With diligence, I lead the people and transform the realm, aspiring to ascend as an immortal and deliver the world, roaming freely. May my seven generations of ancestors be delivered, and may all the generals and officials of the various bureaus be honored with promotions. May the Three Realms receive grace, and may the myriad spirits attain blessings. Were it not for the great unfolding of compassion by the Most High, how could this humble disciple presume to submit this petition?\n\nThis disciple, in all humility, commands the two officials of the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Decision Clerks, the Wind-Presenting Cavalry Clerks, the Memorial-Submitting Posthorse Clerks, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry Clerks—each to dispatch two officers. This disciple, on behalf of [so-and-so], respectfully submits this vermilion memorial of confession, thanksgiving, and petition for transmission and initiation, to be presented to the Three Heavenly Bureaus, and requests its delivery to the Palace of the Supreme Void Primordial Man of the Grand Tenuity Bureau and the Purple Cloud Palace of the Grand Tenuity Court. May it be duly reported.\n\nThis disciple, with utmost reverence and trepidation, kowtows twice and respectfully addresses this to the Supreme Void Primordial Man, the Great Dao Lord of the Grand Tenuity Primordial Ultimate; the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Primordial Man; the Heavenly Emperor, the Heavenly Primordial Man; the Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis, the Nine *Qi* Primordial Men; and the myriad officials of the Grand Tenuity Jade Court of Your Majesty.\n\nOn the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month of the year of the Great Year Star, the memorialist, your subject [so-and-so] of the White surname, a Selected Immortal Graduate of the Jade Emperor’s Golden Gate, presently awaiting your command at the Chongyou Abbey, respectfully submits this.\n\n*Memorial of Merit Discussion at the Thunder Bureau*\nTo the Orthodox Unity of the Great Mystery Capital, the Celestial Master of the Balanced *Qi* Lineage, the South Marchmount Master of the Qingwei Heavenly Transformed *Qi*, and the Perfected of the Red Emperor: your disciple of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scriptures Register, [so-and-so] of the White surname, kowtows twice and respectfully addresses this.\n\nThis disciple is a minor clerk of the Divine Empyrean’s Thunder Bureau, somewhat versed in the affairs governed by thunder, unworthily bearing the books bestowed by thunder, and well-acquainted with the methods enacted by thunder.\n\nYet in their inquiries, records may err, transmissions may stray; thus amid complexity, guidance is offered, amid error, correction is made—obscure points yield their secrets, subtle ones their measures—difficult to know yet easy to practice, difficult to transmit yet easy to learn. What this disciple has mastered has reached this point, and I now lay it all before Your August Presence.\n\nI have heard that when the two *qi* of yin and yang coalesce, they form thunder, and with the advent of thunder and lightning, departments and jurisdictions were divided. The Nine Heavens’ Thunder Ancestor thereby distinguished the Five Attributes, while the Perfected True King of the Divine Empyrean employed them to govern the Three Realms. Yet when I examine the Golden Tripod and consult the Jade Registers, I find that regarding the Five Thunders, doubts persist.\n\nThe *Thunder Writ of the Jade Pivot* states: the first is Heavenly Thunder, the second is Divine Empyrean Thunder, the third is Water Bureau Thunder, the fourth is Dragon Thunder, and the fifth is Earth Altar Thunder.

Which of the ancient Five Thunders is to be regarded as correct? Even the thirty-six thunders handed down through the ages remain doubtful—indeed, they invite further scrutiny.\n\nThe thirty-six thunders are as follows: first, Jade Pivot Thunder; second, Jade Treasury Thunder; third, Heavenly Divination Jade Pillar Thunder; fourth, Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Thunder; fifth, Fire Wheel Thunder; sixth, Dipper-Infusing Thunder; seventh, Wind-Fire Thunder; eighth, Flying Swift Thunder; ninth, Northern Culmen Thunder; tenth, Purple Tenuity Pivot Thunder; eleventh, Divine Empyrean Thunder; twelfth, Immortal Capital Thunder; thirteenth, Great Unity Heaven-Shaking Thunder; fourteenth, Purple Palace Thunder; fifteenth, Iron Armor Thunder; sixteenth, Shaoyang Thunder; seventeenth, Reverent Fire Thunder; eighteenth, Earth Altar Commanding Demon Thunder; nineteenth, Earth Spirit Fire Crow Thunder; twentieth, Three Realms Thunder; twenty-first, Grave-Severing Thunder; twenty-second, Great Awesome Virtue Thunder; twenty-third, Six Waves Thunder; twenty-fourth, Green Grass Thunder; twenty-fifth, Eight Trigrams Thunder; twenty-sixth, Primordial Unity Hawk and Hound Thunder; twenty-seventh, Whistling Mandate Wind and Thunderclap Thunder; twenty-eighth, Fire Cloud Thunder; twenty-ninth, Yu’s Step Great Unity Commanding Thunder; thirtieth, Great Ultimate Thunder; thirty-first, Sword-Tip Thunder; thirty-second, Inner Mirror Thunder; thirty-third, Outer Mirror Thunder; thirty-fourth, Divine Treasury Heavenly Pivot Thunder; thirty-fifth, Great Brahma Dipper Pivot Thunder; and thirty-sixth, Jade Dawn Thunder.\n\nIs this truly what is meant by the thirty-six thunders? Or is it not? If the Five Thunders alone are so manifold, how much more so the thunder methods? Are these the extraordinary and wondrous techniques wielded by divine immortals and perfected beings? Or do the discrepancies arise from inconsistencies in the records of the scriptures and registers?\n\nConsider the deities of the thirty-six thunders: the Celestial Cavern Heavenly Perfected Deities, the Complete Fire Complete Perfected Deities, the Heavenly Raven Heavenly Guard Deities, the Mighty Ding-Xin Deities, the Ice Wheel Water Bowl Deities, the Flowing Light Fire Wheel Deities, the Dripping Past Shouting *Ka* Deities, the Great Unity Primordial August Deities, the Biting Net Sparrow-Tongued Deities, the Heavenly Thunder Wind-Leading Deities, the Fire Hound *Qi* Hound Deities, the Fire Eagle Fishy Smoke Deities, the Heavenly Pass Thunderclap Deities, the Iron Armor Flying Lightning Deities, the Immortal Capital Fire Thunder Deities, the Mountain Thunder Fire Cloud Deities, the Wind-Fire Primordial Brightness Deities, the Fire Earl Wind and Thunderclap Deities, the Gou-Lou Auspicious Benefit Deities, the Weaving Maiden Four Songs Deities, the Jade Thunder Vast Master Deities, the Cavern Yang Hidden Numinous Deities, the Four Brightnesses Public Guest Deities, the Fire Light Flowing Essence Deities, the Void-Riding Great Flower Deities, the Metal Essence Pure Thought Deities, the Azure Fang Iron-Faced Deities, the Scattering Smoke Thunderclap *Qi* Deities, the Thunder Master Pass Earl Deities, the Wood Wolf Astral Light Deities, the Reverent Fire Statutes and Mandates Deities, the Shaoyang Fire Chariot Deities, the Wolf Fang Fierce Officials, the Six Waves Rolling Water Deities, the Flying Eagle Running Hound Deities, and the Flowing Metal Fire Bell Deities.\n\nAre these the thirty-six deities—or are they the thirty-six thunders? Here, too, doubt cannot be avoided.\n\nNow, as collated from the *Cinnabar Empyrean Scripture of Radiance*, the Winnowing Basket Star governs the celestial thunders; the Chamber Star governs the terrestrial thunders; the Straddling Star governs the aqueous thunders; the Ghost Star governs the numinous thunders; and the Bond Star governs the demonic thunders. The celestial thunders pertain to the Winnowing Basket Star, hence the deities of the Celestial Crow, Celestial Garrison, Celestial Cavern, and Celestial Perfection. The terrestrial thunders pertain to the Chamber Star, hence the deities of the Thunder Master, Pass Earl, Fire Earl, and Wind Thunder. The aqueous thunders pertain to the Straddling Star, hence the deities of the Wood Wolf, Cavern Yang, Metal Essence, and Vast Master. The numinous thunders pertain to the Ghost Star, hence the deities of Reverent Fire, Statutes and Mandates, Shaoyang, and Wolf Fang. The demonic thunders pertain to the Bond Star, hence the deities of Ding Xin, Di Xi, He Lou, and Jia Ye. Thus, I alone regard this as correct.\n\nThe thunder methods transmitted from antiquity to the present comprise several grades, their numinous efficacy and manifest proofs resplendent throughout the world and posterity. Thunder and lightning are things that cannot be concealed—who does not know of their existence? Thunder and lightning serve to manifest the majesty of Heaven and to activate the function of the Dao. If the majesty of Heaven were not manifested, how would the destinies of the hidden and the manifest differ, and who would mete out fortune and misfortune? If the function of the Dao were not activated, how would the two qi of yin and yang execute generation and destruction? When the two qi of yin and yang activate the function of the Dao, they manifest the majesty of Heaven; when the destinies of the hidden and the manifest manifest the majesty of Heaven, they activate the function of the Dao. Thus, rewards are not obscured in darkness, nor are punishments concealed in calamity.\n\nAs for the altars of the earth gods and the ranks of the local deities, these are all sacrifices; the numinous platforms and ancient traces are all spirits and gods. Among them, there must be both kindness and malevolence. The wealthy chambers and humble servants all partake in sustenance; the upright and the deceitful are all of the same generation. Among them, there must be both good and evil. If spirits and gods commit offenses, to whom shall the generation appeal? If the generation incurs transgressions, how shall spirits and gods make their grievances known?\n\nAlas! It is for this reason that August Heaven establishes the Thunder Citadel, sets up the Thunder Prison, appoints the Thunder Officials, divides the Thunder Governances, dispenses the Transformations of Thunder, displays the Punishments of Thunder, employs the Thunder Spirits, commands the Thunder Soldiers, exerts the Might of Thunder, and wields the Instruments of Thunder—all to grasp the handle of reward and punishment and to hold the power of generation and destruction. In the yin realm, these may seal mountains, breach caverns, slay demons, and restrain toxins; in the yang realm, they may eliminate the inauspicious, execute the rebellious, punish the treacherous, and slaughter the cruel. Thus are the functions of the Dao activated and the majesty of Heaven manifested. Here, the two qi of yin and yang attain their proper deployment, and the destinies of the hidden and the manifest achieve their responsive effects.\n\nWithin Heaven and Earth, the myriad things stand established—none fail to receive the yin and yang qi in their ceaseless generation. That which possesses form and thought is human; that which is formless yet possesses thought is a ghost. Humans dwell in the yang; ghosts dwell in the yin. By this, they traverse the Four Modes of Birth and cycle through the Six Paths. Were it not for the thunder and lightning of Heaven, how could punishments be displayed and the obstinate and foolish be corrected?\n\nI, your servant, have been blessed with good fortune since my former existence and have presumptuously joined the ranks of the thunder officials. I have vowed to practice and uphold this without the slightest negligence. On this auspicious day, I prostrate myself and present this memorial, submitting it to the Three Heavenly Courts. I respectfully dispatch the Mute Master of the Wind-Fire Primordial Radiance within the Dharma, the Fire Earl Wind Thunder, the Thunder Master Pass Earl Divine Lord, the Fire Bell Thunderclap Heavenly Immortal, the Azure Fang Iron-Faced Great Immortal, the Dragon Thunder Rolling Water Divine Lord, the Wind-Fire Dragon Rider Heaven-Shaking Sea-Boiling Divine Lord, the Thunderclap Fire Light Silver Fang Dazzling-Eyed Divine Lord, the Reverent Fire Statutes and Mandates Great Spirit, the Thunder Duke Fire Chariot Marshal, the Three-Five Iron-Faced Fire Chariot Great General, the Three-Five Shaoyang Commander-in-Chief General, the Thunderclap Fire Chariot Rank-Smoke Envoy, the Four Sages Hearing and Inspecting Return-Chariot Envoy, the Floating Cloud Descending Hail Valiant, the Horizontal-Body Flying Cloud Envoy, the Mountain-Moving Sea-Overturning Iron-Armored Envoy, the Cavern Wind Drum Heaven-Shaking Might Red Script Envoy, the Wind Hail Metal Bell Fire Bell Envoy, the Five Thunders Flying Swift Envoy, the Thunder Formation Left and Right Envoys, the Scattering Clouds Dispensing Fire Prohibiting Flames Envoy, the Western Terrace Thunder Rain Officer, the Heaven-Bearing Stone-Carrying Grand Tenuity Commanding Might Sword Thunder Spirit Officer, the Four Seasons Wind Rain Command Jade Light Metal Essence Superior Officer, the Demon-Swallowing Demon-Devouring Heavenly Armored Spirit Officer, the Cinnabar Prime Minister of the Ministry of Punishments, the Dragon-Capturing Demon-Seizing Mountain-Shaking Divine Lord, the Sea-Blowing Wave-Raising Numinous Splendor Fierce Officer, the Flying Clouds Running Lightning Spirit Officer, the Grand Year General, the Plague and Pestilence Managing Envoy, the Five Directions Thunder Duke Generals, the Heavenly Thunder Dazzling Light General, the Water Thunder Lightning Flash Six Dragon General, the Left and Right Divine Generals of the Jade Pivot Palace, the Left and Right Divine Generals of the Northern Culmen Palace, the Left and Right Divine Generals of the Penglai Thunder Bureau, the Thirty-Six Thunder Drum Valiants, the Howling Mandate Wind Thunder Great General, the Generals and Commanders of the Various Five Thunders Bureaus, the Officers and Soldiers of the Various Five Thunders Bureaus, and the Five Directions Barbarian Thunder Envoys—all to accompany this memorial to the Capital Palace, where merits and achievements shall be reviewed, diligence and efforts examined. Those recorded shall be promoted; those appointed shall be transferred; those assigned shall be installed; those selected shall be elevated.\n\nOn the *xinhai* day of the twelfth month of this year, I shall command the Five Thunders officials, officers, and soldiers to proceed in advance to the Primordial Response Grand Tenuity Mansion to record merits and inscribe achievements. Furthermore, on the morning of the first day of the *bingzi* year, the first day of the Celestial New Year, they shall ascend directly to the Jade Purity to present themselves in audience and petition. On the seventh day of the third month, they shall be permitted to attend the Heavenly Court’s Selection and Reward Assembly. By the morning of the *jiazi* day of the first month, the dawn of the Grand Unity’s Review of Spirits and Deities, the Five Thunders generals and officers shall each attain a merit. Awaiting the morning of the fifteenth day of the first month, the dawn of the Upper Prime Heavenly Mansion’s bestowal of blessings, they shall all proceed to the Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Pivot Palace to receive their customary promotions, each advancing one rank.\n\nI humbly pray that my ninefold ancestors of the mysterious and my sevenfold ancestors may together attain promotion, and that the spirits and gods of the Three Realms may all partake in blessings and benefits. Thereafter, I vow to pray for clear skies and beseech for rain, to summon snow and raise clouds, to command lightning and call forth thunder, to drive winds and descend hail, to seal mountains and breach caverns, to fell temples and expel demons, to execute and behead dragons, to subdue wolves and tigers, to dispel water and fire, to expel drought and locusts, to exorcise disasters for the people, to drive away evil and cure illnesses, to issue talismanic commands, and to manifest responsive retributions.\n\nMay I, your humble servant, beseech Your Majesty to bestow the black essence of the Purple Numinous and Mysterious Unity, allowing it to flow into my three burners and five viscera, filling and overflowing within the Three Origins and Nine Palaces, so that my heart may expand and my body flourish, my spirit become clear and my qi invigorated, that I may study the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and attain immortality.\n\nYour servant, in all foolishness and reverence, through the offices of the Two Palaces’ Direct Envoys of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Palace Envoys, the Yin-Yang Divine Formula Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Stalwart Wind Post Riders, the Relay Horse Memorial Clerks, the Flying Dragon Riders, and two officials from each of these ranks, now presents this memorial—a vermilion petition of merit-discussion from the Thunder Bureau—submitted this day to the Three Heavenly Courts, to be forwarded to the Palace of the Supreme Void-Primal Venerable, and to the White Tiger Palace of the Capital Inspectorate. May it be duly reported.\n\nWith utmost awe and trepidation, I prostrate myself and bow twice to make known to the Great Clarity’s Mysterious Primordial Supreme Ultimate Great Dao, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Void-Primal Venerable; to the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the Supreme Venerable; to the Heavenly Thearch Lord, the Heavenly Thearch Venerable; to the Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis Lord, the Nine Qi Venerable; to the myriad, countless, layered Dark Dao’s Twelve Hundred Official Lords; and to the Jade August One of the Great Clarity.\n\nIn the twelfth month of winter, on the twenty-seventh day of the *xinhai* cyclical sign, at the auspicious hour, in the eighth year of the *Jiading* reign, *yihai* year of the Great Song, at the southwest corner of the *Chongyou* Abbey on Mount Wuyi, I bow twice and present this.\n\nYour servant, surnamed Bai, a Selected Scholar of the Golden Watchtower, presently awaiting command at the memorial-submitting station.\n\n*Xiuzhen Shishu Wuyi Ji*, Scroll Forty-Seven, concludes.\n*Xiuzhen Shishu Wuyi Ji*, Scroll Forty-Eight.\n\n**Master Bai Yuchan of Hainan’s \"Song of the Crooked Arm\"**\n\nLong ago in the First Palace of Azure Radiance,\nI rode a dragon in drunken fury—what cause?\nA half-drop from the golden flask spilled,\nUnseen, yet the mortal world drowned in flood.\n\nThe Jade Thearch raged, demanding of the Divine Empyrean:\n\"Who dares ride the dragon and stir chaos?\"\nSince parting from Thunder City with one backward glance,\nHeaven and earth have stretched immeasurably far.\n\nExiled to the dusty world, my heart wavers,\nRefining the golden elixir, awaiting the crane’s return.\nOnce back in the Divine Empyrean to pay homage to the Jade Thearch,\nI was reinstated to command the winds and thunder.\n\nThe Five Thunders sealed deep within the Jade Clarity Palace,\nWhite cranes summon winds, shrieking through the azure void.\nSpeak of such hardships,\nAnd the Three Thousand Jade Maidens knit their brows.\n\nThe Supreme Heavenly Thearch visited the Purple Clarity,\nA million jade maidens crowding like clouds.\nI should not have lifted my gaze—\nSuddenly, the Heavenly Guards brandished their fire-bells in rebuke.\n\nI bear no grudge against the Jade Thearch,\nYet the jade maidens no longer dance in rainbow skirts.\nHow could celestial immortals,\nBe sullied by a single scattered youth?\n\nAwakened from the dream of Southern Branch, I saw my past folly—\nWhere the green fades, we parted in flight.\nThe cold pines vainly lock the jade maidens’ dreams,\nWhile I alone remain unable to return.\n\nThe Jade Bureau’s officials are few,\nYet the Supreme Thearch pities my toil.\nSuddenly, an edict descends, hastening my return—\nApes wail through ten thousand mountains, the white clouds drift empty.\n\nThe Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool feasts the immortals,\nTwo orchestras of reed pipes and songs crowd the brocade banquet.\nMistakenly, I plucked a single immortal plum to eat—\nAnd once more descended to the mortal world, years uncounted.\n\nI have not been in the human realm a hundred years,\nYet it seems but a moment in the Three Heavens.\nOnce I was an officer of thunder and lightning,\nNow cease doubting—what sort of immortal am I?\n\nIn days past, I roamed carefree on Mount Taihua,\nFeasting on jade nectar, gazing at jasper blossoms.\nClad in a six-ounce robe,\nI knew not the mortal world had ramie hemp.\n\nHaving attained the rank of celestial immortal,\nThrice I was cast down from the heavenly steps by divine censure.\nWeary of heaven’s many offices,\nI sought instead the grottoes of the mortal world to wander.\n\nWhite clouds follow me to Mount Tiantai,\nThen turn back along the Golden Flower Road.\nAt the Perch of the Phoenix, I lingered,\nWhile wild apes wailed below Mount Wuyi.\n\nLet the clear wind and bright moon know:\nIn Yangzhou, there is a crane I cannot ride.\nLast night, before the Five Phoenix Tower,\nI watched the white clouds drift aimlessly in the sky.\n\nDisheveled hair, tattered robe,\nWhen vexed, I drink and recite poems in drunkenness.\nI’ve wandered the dusty world unrecognized—\nI am the son of the Eastern August Thearch.\n\nTwenty years have passed in vain,\nMy flesh too heavy to ascend to heaven.\nI shake my sleeves and laugh at myself,\nMy purse empty—not a single coin.\n\nI carry a pearl at my side,\nSeen, it seems present; sought, it vanishes.\nWhen the golden rooster crows, none see me,\nOnly the moon’s cold light fills the Great Void.\n\nI know not sutras nor sit in meditation,\nHungry, I eat; weary, I sleep.\nIf the Jade Thearch does not favor me,\nI remain a mortal, my bones untransfigured.\n\nI do not cast my gaze upon the vulgar,\nMy empty self roams the Five Lakes and Four Seas.\nIn the depths of the grotto-heavens, none tread,\nBy the stream, how many springs have the peach blossoms seen?\n\nSeas turn to mulberry fields, fields to seas—\nSuch words are hard to believe.\nYet one thing surpasses me:\nThe king knows not such leisure.\n\n**Inscribed at the Perch of the Phoenix**\n\nBefore the pavilion, jade-like greenery forms dense thickets,\nThe phoenix perches in the branches, mist and rain dissolve into emptiness.\nA single note of flute or pipe, yet none sleep—\nThe bright moon bathes the entire grove in clear wind.\n\nSounds of zither and harp, wind stirs the pillow,\nShadows of jade-like trees spill across the moonlit courtyard.\nA white phoenix alights beyond the branches to roost,\nDeep in the night, it punctures the verdant grove with light.\n\nBamboo has for years tended wind and moon,\nHow many nights has the phoenix lodged in clouds and mist?\nA guest in the grove plays the flute and departs,\nThe bamboo transforms into a dragon, the phoenix ascends to heaven.\n\nAt the Pavilion of the Pan Clan, I drank through the night,\nDrunk, I faced the bamboo and played the jasper flute.\nWho knows how many phoenixes have come?\nThe phoenix gone, the man departed, the bamboo stands desolate.\n\n**Night Discourse at the Pavilion of Pure Excellence**\n\nThe dying lamp blossoms like crimson filling the hall,\nWine’s fervor unspent, poetry’s passion surges.\nCold clouds and moth-like stars seal the emerald sky,\nA grove of bamboo whispers to the night wind.\n\nThe reclusive scholar leans on the tower, whistling like a jade dragon,\nCicadas weep dew, falling upon the parasol trees.\nHand in hand, we discourse on literature, opening our hearts—\nSweet slumber beckons, our words left unfinished.\n\nIncense coils like flying serpents through the curtains,\nNeighboring roosters herald dawn—where is the bell?\nRubbing my drunken eyes, I grasp the railing,\nThe tea kettle cold, I summon the jade youth.\n\nThree companions in straw sandals, seven-foot staffs,\nTread through green mountains, how many layers?\n\n**Night Feast at the Pavilion of Pure Excellence, Presented to Ni Meichuang and Daoist Wu Yinnan**\n\nBefore the mountain, a resounding song—my voice dries,\nA long whistle pierces the Gate of Azure Clouds.\nMaster Meichuang brings a hundred flasks,\nThrough the night we converse, autumn rain turns cold.\n\nLamps glow red, casting jade insects in intricate patterns,\nThe Daoist roars, slapping the bed in laughter.\nSharing a couch, Yinnan and I strike a pact,\nEager to see serpents slither across the paper.\n\nSetting down the cup, I strain my eyes, seized by poetic frenzy,\nSeizing a brush, half-dozing.\nLaughing, I dip Kunlun in the vast sea,\nWriting tens of thousands of new verses.\n\n**Inscribed on the Wall of the Pavilion of Pure Excellence**\n\nTwo rare blossoms, one censer of incense,\nA heart untroubled, thus pure and empty.\nOn the wall, a zither; on the bed, a sword—\nA resounding song, a slow, ethereal chant.\n\nMy aspirations beyond the mundane are inherently refined,\nThe mountain pavilion’s pure excellence suffices for all things.\nI pour myself three or two cups of wine,\nPlay three or two games of uncontentious chess.\n\n**Again Inscribed at the Pavilion of Pure Excellence**\n\nA grove of bamboo whispers in the night wind,\nFrom the southern pole, a single point of cold pierces the void.\nA jade censer exudes rare fragrance, distant as the Jade Palace—\nHere, one knows there dwells an immortal elder.\n\nWithin the Pavilion of Pure Excellence, secluded and exquisite,\nA white-bearded Daoist holds a sandalwood tablet.\nHis brows lift, parting the clouds over the stream,\nHis gaze flashes, shattering the moon atop the peaks.\n\nOn the jasper chamber’s wall hangs a jade zither,\nAfter dancing with the sword, a heart of ancient times.\nParted from Penglai, drunk, I played the flute—\nToday, upon meeting, I sing a long ode.\n\nHeavenly spirits rebuke the Dao, green mist rises,\nBefore me, Wang and Zhao all wear pearl-studded slippers.\nThe weary dragon coils its tail, the green serpent dies—\nWith a flick of the finger, the Milky Way pours forth.\n\nA single flourish of the cinnabar talisman sends gods and ghosts fleeing,\nThunder and lightning shake heaven and earth.\nTruly, such marvelous efficacy was unknown in ancient times—\nYet still, it has not been gathered to the celestial thoroughfare.\n\nThe moon is cold, the wind clear, a white crane cries,\nA jeweled censer scatters rosy mist toward the distant Jade Flask.\nThe Master of Mount Wuyi delights in poetry and wine—\nOnce I saw you, but now you are gone.\n\n**Inscribed on the Hall of Pure Emptiness**\nThe moon shifts, casting flower shadows beyond the window,\nThe wind carries the sound of pines to the pillow’s edge.\nAfter dancing the long sword, I brew tea and taste it,\nWith a new poem composed, I embrace the zither and sleep.\n\nFresh wine is poured like green snail marrow,\nIncense coils burn like purple horsewhips.\nAt the head of Nine-Bend Stream stands the Temple of Divine Protection—\nWithin the Hall of Pure Emptiness dwells a transcendent.\n\n**First Encounter with the Lazy Old Man’s Poetry**\nA handful of spirit soars far beyond the dust,\nThe Lazy One is no ordinary man.\nTao Yuanming’s pines and chrysanthemums remain evergreen,\nXie Lingyun’s pond and grasses are in spring’s prime.\n\nHe has already planted *gouqi* in the fields of magic mushrooms,\nNo need to grind the mossy steps with a chariot’s wheels.\nThe family’s robe and bowl are passed to dragons and phoenixes,\nHe himself points to the ice-pure flask, heir to Yingbin.\n\n**Two Poems Presented to the Lazy Old Man**\nAutumn’s mirror reveals stars at my temples,\nEverywhere, streams and mountains are Dongting’s expanse.\nFierce rain strikes the lotus, tilting the green pond,\nA gale snaps the bamboo, flinging it over the wall.\n\nPurple swallows take flight from the water-chestnut isle,\nWhite gulls tuck their necks to sleep on the desolate shoal.\nI don a bamboo hat to seek the Lazy One,\nBringing a breath of crisp air through the lattice.\n\nThe Lazy Old Man and Old Bai form a bond across years,\nAutumn enters the misty, sparse-rain sky.\nDrunk, he dreams a perfect black-sweet dream,\nAt times, he lets the grass-script run wild.\n\nLeaning on his staff, he repays the debts of streams and mountains,\nWith cups of wine, he befriends the wind and moon.\nThe Green Lad gallops across the moat,\nThe Wooden Clerk weaves heroic verses.\n\nJinhua is but a handful in size,\nYet it holds two immortals of poetry and wine.\n\n**Six Six-Character Poems Presented to the Lazy Old Man**\nThe weary one coldly dwells on Guye,\nThe layman loftily sleeps in Vimalakirti’s realm.\nDull in poetry’s covenant and wine’s pact,\nHe merely burns incense and sips tea.\n\nWhen the wine turns foul, he sniffs the flowers,\nWhen sleep is deep, he pours tea to wake.\nAutumn arrives on the wutong branches,\nNight brings the sound of wind and rain.\n\nHis golden body is green as bamboo leaves,\nThe Jade Maiden white as lotus blossoms.\nHearing you are slightly unwell, body freed,\nI lean on my staff, wishing to visit your home.\n\nLotus and herbs resent the wind’s havoc,\nRice seedlings gain spirit from the rain.\nRecalling Mount Wuyi’s Nine Bends,\nLast autumn, I poled a boat along the stream’s edge.\n\nDrunk, I transformed into a butterfly on my pillow,\nAwake, my brush gave birth to serpents.\nLong days, my heart is free of cares,\nWhen hungry, I merely dine on rosy clouds.\n\nAutumn rain recognizes sorrow in segments,\nEvening clouds pass before the eyes like blossoms.\nThe Phoenix Perch Pavilion stands desolate,\nYet Mount Wuyi once had immortals.\n\n**Arriving Drunk at the Lazy Old Man’s Study and Singing**\nFreshly opened white wine, lotus pods bought,\nPoured full, tung oil shines in the jade vat.\nThe Moon Maiden peeks through the green canopy,\nThe Wind Spirit gently stirs the emerald gauze window.\n\nYou suspect I am today’s Huangfu,\nI fear you are the old Pang of yore.\nAfter drinking, I spit pearls that stick to the paper,\nLaughing, I pit my brush’s strength against others.\n\n**White Lotus Poem**\nYuanming returned to the Western Heaven,\nNo longer part of the Eastern Grove’s community.\nNo sign of Zhang Changzong,\nNo one speaks of this.\n\nWhose home planted the green lotus,\nScented winds ripple the jade waves?\nBeneath the waves, crystal emptiness,\nFrom which emerges the Jade Mansion’s maiden.\n\nGraceful, silent, and delicate,\nHer ice-like skin bears the morning’s rain.\nThe Eastern Lord is like summer’s sun,\nYet this flower feels no heat.\n\nA single point of natural fragrance,\nFollowing the wind into the painted hall.\nPlucked and placed in the corner of the seat,\nShe entices the jade-like gentleman.\n\nSuddenly, my mood shifts,\nAs if gazing upon a beauty’s face.\nI send word to the Pavilion of Bright Moonlight,\nDo not house the pair of flying swallows.\n\n**Failed Elixir**\nEight ounces of sun and moon’s essence,\nHalf a catty of cloud and mist’s fragments.\nLight as a swan’s feather,\nHeavy as a thousand scales of iron.\n\nWhite as snow in the sky,\nRed as a gibbon’s blood.\nGathered into a jade gourd,\nSealed, not daring to leak.\n\nAt midnight, sudden wind and thunder,\nSmoke fills the vast emptiness.\nSuch flavor and feeling—\nA mute bites his tongue in silence.\n\nClutching my belly, I laugh,\nLest my heart and brain grow fevered.\nBetter to mend my fishing rod,\nAnd cut another section of autumn bamboo.\n\n*The Forty-Eighth Scroll of Cultivating the True: Wuyi Collection Concludes*\n*The Forty-Ninth Scroll of Cultivating the True: Wuyi Collection*\n\n**By Bai Yuchan of Hainan**\n\n**To Grand Preceptor Wang**\nLaughing, you stride from the palace gates,\nA single long whistle turns ten thousand peaks green.\nReturning, carriages and horses crowd like clouds,\nSweeping away court stars—awake from a dream.\n\nRuby agate cups brim with white wine,\nA coral pillow leans against a vermilion screen.\nYet you must seize this strength to study,\nTo become one of the Tang’s five transcendent sages.\n\n**Matching Lu Gen’an’s Rhyme**\nI once stood at the head of the morning court,\nMy office as cold and clear as autumn skies.\nWind, flowers, snow, moon—worth a thousand gold coins,\nWater, bamboo, clouds, mountains—worth ten thousand households.\n\nThe sea traveler’s pact with gulls remains unbroken,\nThe frontier elder’s lost horse seeks no more.\nBeyond the bright window and upright desk,\nButterflies flutter through the dream of *Huaxu*.\n\n**Inscribed on Zhang Zhineng’s *Xiu Ran* Pavilion**\nUntouched by the world’s slightest dust,\nA solitary man dwells in quiet seclusion.\nOn clear nights, a saint beneath the wine jar,\nBy day, poems from his brush move the gods to tears.\n\nTender grass grieves the hoe’s green purity,\nFallen blossoms, unraked, love their crimson evenness.\nChess sounds sever the path to *Huaxu*,\nAs he burns incense in the *Boshan* censer at dusk.\n\n**Matching Ye Zai’s Rhyme on *Zhen Wujiu* Studio**\nSnail-horn, fly-head gains—how detestable!\nWhy ask again of profit and fame?\nLearn the wondrous precelestial Dao of high antiquity,\nAnd embrace the single sincerity of the *Doctrine of the Mean*.\n\nHeaven and earth are the sun and moon’s ancestors,\n*Kan* and *Li* are the essence of sky and earth.\nWhen study reaches *Zhen Wujiu*,\nA single word uproots the thatch, riding the great *Tai* prosperity.\n\n**On the Autumn Equinox, Thinking of Clerk Chen**\nA noseless, earless leaf falls—\nWhere is the wind that maddens and topples?\nNinety days of heat swept clean away,\nThe sweat in my breast already vanished.\n\nI trouble the astute Judge Pan,\nTo tell Clerk Chen, our Friend Long:\nIf tonight brings no rain, the moon will be fine—\nOne cup of wine must still be shared with you.\n\n**Fifty-Six Characters Composed in a Dream**\nDrunk and sober, I lean on my staff to visit Pine Pass,\nJust at dusk, amid deepening mist.\nDeparted, yet returning—autumn’s lingering heat,\nSeemingly absent, yet present—mountains in the rain.\n\nBy the stream, a few late blossoms fall,\nAt the sky’s edge, a crescent moon bends.\nI sense the lingering smoke burying my sandal teeth,\nStep by step, imprinting the moss’s mottled traces.\n\n**In Hu’s Hidden Hut, Lamenting Spring**\nI leave all creation to *Zhurong*,\nAs the Eastern Emperor returns to *Taihua Palace*.\nMountains stand sharp as green jade,\nWaves shimmer, soaking bronze’s sheen.\n\nWillows reach the sky—doves summon rain,\nCrabapples fall to earth—butterflies shun the wind.\nBest to take staff and sandals to the western garden,\nWhere ten thousand purples and reds vanish in a single night.\n\n**Sending Spring Off from the Lodge of Rest**\nPoems flow naturally from the brush, rich with material,\nHeaven’s craft carves fine mountain streams.\nFish, knowing the water’s warmth, leap without cease,\nOrioles, seeing flowers fly, cry endlessly.\n\nThe tree-top turtledove’s wife calls for rain,\nBamboo behind the hut teaches its shoots to rise from mud.\nAfter ten cups of *Taibai*, one is dead drunk—\nAt the mouth of the Peach Blossom Grotto, the sun sinks west.\n\n**Occasional Lines in Hu’s Winning Hut**\nThe Daoist is used to eating sesame rice,\nArriving in the world—how many years has it been?\nBefore the White Jade Tower, the moon of night is empty,\nAbove the Purple Gold Hall, spring mist rises.\n\nLeisurely, he pours a cup of *Zhonghuang* wine,\nBored, he sweeps a thousand chapters of *Neijing* scriptures.\nLast night, *Zhongli* passed down kind words,\nTeaching me to become an earth-walking immortal for now.\n\n**To Old Fan of Tiantai**\nSince parting, how many springs have startled us?\nMeeting again, we laugh, embracing the southern breeze.\nAshen-faced, dust-covered—no one recognizes us,\nRefusing to eat grass-cloth, disdaining worldly fuss.\n\nIn Zhe’s Tiantai, you’ve long resided,\nYour name, Fan Bing, unknown and obscure.\nI send these new poems to you,\nTo deliver to Zhao Cuiyun of Qianshan.\n\n**To Wu Caoqiu**\nI hear that on Green City Mountain lives Old Hao,\nHis words, entering my ears, now ten years past.\nBy chance, with the carefree traveler and the joyless maiden,\nI came to Tiantai and met him.\n\nHis clothes are plain hemp,\nHis speech all alchemical texts.\nI think you are already over a thousand years old—\nWho says immortals do not exist in this world?\n\n**To Vice Minister Su**\nPast and present shift like shoulders,\nI suspect you are Su Shi reborn.\nThe whole city lacks a single *Bo Le*—\nCould there be a day without a *Le Tian*?\n\nJust now discussing literature, we part abruptly,\nUnknowing when we’ll clasp hands again.\nSuddenly, an iron flute sounds—\nIts notes reach the ancient grottoes of Jinhua.\n\n**Painting of the Heaven-Opened Library Tower**\nLayered eaves rise into the azure void,\nA thousand peaks, ten thousand peaks, sending and welcoming.\nClear clouds, already wiped away, linger unfinished,\nAt the stream’s end, the last glow of sunset gleams.\n\nNature’s craft, morning and night, applies its touches,\nInk and colors shift in depth and hue.\nLeaning on the railing, I stretch my thousand-mile gaze,\nYet grieve that this scroll cannot be fully unfurled.\n\n**To Master Wei**\nI once saw you on Jiuhua Mountain,\nMorning feasting on jade milk and jasper flowers.\nAt night, a deer-horn cap beneath the moon of Green City,\nAt dawn, a crane cloak draped in purple palace mist.\n\nOccasionally, you carry a sword in the human world,\nYet have not taken your zither to the immortals’ home.\nLaughing, we meet amid pines and bamboo,\nBurning incense, sipping tea, sharing new words.\n\n**Visiting Yangzi Cliff**\nHalfway up the sky, autumn wind sighs through ten thousand pines,\nQiang flowers half-fallen in the reddening sunset.\nHermitage smoke veils the ancient immortal altar,\nWild grass hides the empty cinnabar cauldron.\n\nWhere do people gather purple mushrooms?\nI come at noon, yet find no one.\nA single note of flute and pipe—laughing, I raise my sleeves,\nAutumn’s hues fill my breast, my poetic mood thickens.\n\n**After Visiting Yan Cliff, Parting with Its Master**\nThe west wind blows me to this cliff’s wanderings,\nMy eyes brim with emerald pines and bamboos.\nJade swallows do not fly on moonlit nights,\nA stone bell’s chime startles the frosty autumn dawn.\n\nAlas, we part—north and south diverging,\nSuddenly turning back, torn between leaving and staying.\nGo first to the human world to prepare elixir ingredients,\nThen return to the mountain’s peak to build a thatched hut and rest.\n\n**Inscribed on the Shu Family’s *Nan Lao* Pavilion**\nA separate cave-heaven in the human world,\nStalwart pines rise in dense, auspicious mist.\nVirtue like cassia seeds, unaware of the years,\nFortune like flowing water, endless in time.\n\nBefore the *Xuan* grass hall, affairs of a thousand ages,\nAtop the lotus pond, two immortals.\nThe man in *lai* robes, playing with colors, remains unharmed—\nHe weaves all the streams and mountains into green wind and moon.\n\nThe thirty-third heaven’s first day,\nBeneath the Jade Emperor’s palace, wispy smoke curls.\n\nUnknowing of kalpas, what era is this now?\nJust the second year of Yan Kang’s reign.\nWeak waters admit no boat—homeward bound like an arrow,\nWhile Hua Xu’s dreams invite a roaming immortal’s play.\n\nSeated before the *Nan Lao* Pavilion, staff in hand,\nI kindle incense and steep tea in emerald depths.\n\n**To the Lute Guest Lu Yuan-zhang**\nA shard of frigid crystal in hand,\nTen fingers strike and pluck like jade’s chime.\nThe tune plays *White Snow* and *Yang Chun*’s mode,\nIts melody the sound of lofty mountains and flowing streams.\nPine tops echo crane cries at midnight’s half,\nCold mist hangs still, the wind’s chill whisper.\nPaper quilt and tile pillow cold as water,\nTossing sleepless, no dream comes.\nRising to scratch my head, I strum one piece,\nChanting done, the autumn moon illumines the mountain.\n\n**Inscribed on the Hermit’s Lodge**\nFine pines, fine bamboos, fine streams and hills,\nCarriages and horses throng, coming and going.\nTravelers hear the new wine’s white froth,\nEntering, they tread through tender moss’s speckled green.\nI say this pure seclusion beyond the world\nIs yet like a bustling marketplace’s clamor.\nValleys’ grain and mulberries fill empty huts,\nThe host attends guests, never idle.\n\n**Rainy Inscription at a Traveler’s Inn**\nWind stirs the vast sky, autumn rain hangs,\nThe road slick as moss, I lazily shake the whip.\nEntering, I bid the servant buy a cup of wine,\nGrind ink, lean by the window, chant a verse.\nYellow bamboo beneath the far eaves, yellow ants war,\nWhite reeds mirror the water where white gulls sleep.\nA long whistle, then I depart,\nTurning back, the lone village fades in evening mist.\n\n**Golden Immortal Pavilion at Immortal Crag**\nCold mist seals the Brahma-king’s abode,\nA single censer’s smoke coils like a coiling snake.\nAutumn rain falls like jade flowers across the sky,\nThe clear stream swells green, submerging level sands.\nAncient pines and jagged rocks vie in height,\nGreen vines drag trees, veiling clouds.\nBamboo roots upturn, crow wings aslant,\nMidnight’s cold wind stirs roosting crows.\nThe wooden fish calls for congee, butterflies wake,\nAt the cliff’s edge, the waning moon sinks into the cinnabar well.\n\n**The Indolent Hut**\nOnce a name in the Scarlet Towers’ pure capital,\nThis life drifts, carefree, following nature’s truth.\nAcross the window, an ancient inkstone holds water of bygone ages,\nOn the wall, a neglected lute gathers days of dust.\nLeave the creeping grasses unweeded, still by the stones,\nLet fallen blossoms lie unbrushed, even with the moss.\nEnlist the wind as a gate-keeping servant,\nBorrow the moon as a wine-companion.\nHistories and classics hold silent, ancient savor,\nBarriers and mountains stand unmoved, a painting’s spirit.\nWith tea at hand, I’ll not wage snail wars,\nWithout dreams, I’ll not take a butterfly’s form.\nWhat idle matters occupy me?\nBeyond the eaves, birds know the same spring.\n\n**The Joyful Studio**\nA recluse’s retreat amid pines and bamboos,\nA small hall reclines beneath the northern mountain’s shade.\nDeep night, the cold moon chills the thatched door,\nDawn’s rise, the clear wind refreshes the paper quilt.\nGrasping the sword, I drink wine from the cup’s face,\nStowing books, I disturb the wall-hung lute.\nSince glimpsing Fuxi’s visage,\nWho through the ages has known the nurturing of a vast heart?\n\n**Heavenly Valley Hermitage**\nHalfway to heaven, a singular peak juts,\nA tiny thatched hut holds rich savor.\nFlanking the path, new pines beckon the night moon,\nThe grove’s dense bamboos summon autumn winds.\nWild birds greet with intricate calls,\nRock flowers vex with their riotous red.\nLeaning on my staff, I follow the flowing stream,\nThe brushwood gate often sealed by white clouds.\n\n**The Chamber of Descending Perfection**\nJade chimes resound, colored incense swirls,\nBeyond the window, azure birds cry at midnight’s half.\nPines and bamboos, silent, vie for earth’s stillness,\nStars seem pluckable, the sky feels low.\nGolden chariots rise at the yellow-clouded eave’s corner,\nA jade ladder unfurls from the moonlit roof’s edge.\nBowing to the Purple Emperor after the first feast,\nThe *bu xu* chant fades, begging for the elixir’s measure.\n\n**To the Indolent Hut’s Lu, Vice Officer**\nMountain hues congeal in layered emerald clouds,\nCrow cries startle the setting sun to red.\nI’d carry the lute to play beneath autumn’s moon,\nOr snatch the chessboard to move with the evening breeze.\nOnce drunk and asleep, I know affairs grow few,\nSeveral chants clear, the heart feels empty.\nThe Indolent Hut keeps no company,\nIts barred brushwood gate holds rich savor.\n\n**Lu Shu-yu’s Pavilion of Pure Poverty**\nUtterly carefree, heedless of heaven,\nAt five *zhang*’s height, the sun lingers, yet he sleeps on.\nStream fish and village wine hold uncommon savor,\nWild greens and mountain grains cost no coin.\nAn urn for a window, a painted gate blocks the narrow path,\nDry firewood and white rice boil in clear spring water.\nSometimes leaning on a staff by the verdant pines,\nHe is the human world’s blissful immortal.\n\n**The Inferior Recluse**\nWorldly warmth and chill sting the nose,\nThe cave’s gate stands ajar, green mist chills.\nGrasping a three-foot sword, I dance in the wind,\nHolding a lute, I play to the moon.\nI hew bamboo to let water pass,\nLean on pines half the day, clasping scriptures.\nIn the heart’s leisure amid mountains and forests,\nI refine the elixir of deathless life.\n\n**The Forty-Ninth Scroll of *Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection: Wuyi Collection*

the cloud’s edge?\n\n**Returning Elixir Poems of the Three Flowers Abbey**\n\nThe Crimson Palace lies at ease, free of dust,\nKan’s tiger and Li’s dragon wage countless battles.\nWhite snow flies through the void as lead blooms,\nYellow clouds shroud the crucible as mercury flowers unfold.\nTortoise and serpent embrace unity, forming the elixir,\nRaven and hare congeal truth, shaping the sacred embryo.\nAt midnight, beneath Yingzhou’s cold moon,\nA chill wind carries the crane to Penglai.\n\n**Three Poems Sending Off Jiang Zigong**\n\nI wished to build a thatched hut by Yang Village,\nYet my traces drift once more to rivers and lakes.\nLooking back, a footstep seems as distant as the sky,\nSince parting, barely a month has passed.\nIn fleeting moments, I think of old friends,\nAcross a thousand miles, I long for word.\nThe memory of you lingers, unbearable to forget—\nA wisp of blue cloud dots the great void.\n\nSpring arrives, traversing lush fields,\nClouds fill the spring sky, water brims the streams.\nWind ripples green waves, barley sways,\nSun shines, red rain falls on peach-lined paths.\nThe cuckoo’s cry fades, startling the cold hare,\nThe butterfly’s dream ends, roused by the dawn cock.\nYou dwell east of the river, sending word home—\nAs crabapple blossoms fade, swallows carry mud.\n\nYou reach Lead Mountain, I remain in Xin Prefecture,\nThe bamboo sedan creaks, then rests once more.\nThrough misty rain and slanting winds, the road winds,\nA scattering of fallen blossoms grieves the cawing crow.\nWhy weep like Ruan Ji?\nCome, wander with Red Pine instead.\nOne day, when I ascend Penglai,\nWill you follow, bearing a grain of golden elixir?\n\n**Sending Off Master Zhang**\n\nSince you left Mount Wu,\nHow many perils and hardships have you endured?\nOn the Jiang’s left bank, rain has dogged your travels,\nSpring’s deep roads slick with moss.\nCrows cry, petals drift on flowing water,\nWind howls, gibbons shriek from ancient

incense.\n\n**Nijingfu of Keshan**\n\nDusk clouds stretch across green slopes, the sun slants,\nThe song tower’s echoes fade, crows call beyond the woods.\nGreen bamboo sways, shadows dancing in the

      "translated_text": "**Preface to the Reconstruction of Zhi Zhi Hermitage in the Wuyi Mountains**\n*From the Forty-Fifth Scroll of the* Ten Books on Cultivating the Dao: Wuyi Collection, *by Bai Yuchan of Hainan*\n\nThe Wuyi Mountains, as recorded in the *Liexian Zhuan* of the Qin era, were where Qian Keng refined the elixir. Qian Keng presented pheasant broth to Emperor Yao, who enfeoffed him at Pengcheng; later, he was called Peng Zu, living to seven hundred and seventy-seven years before passing. Throughout his life, he concealed himself in the Wuyi Mountains, consuming lingzhi and drinking from waterfalls, able to ride the wind and command qi, soaring through the void—was he not a transcendent? Keng had two sons: the elder named Qian Wu, the younger Qian Yi, whence the name Wuyi Mountains derived.\n\nAt the first bend of the Nine Bends Stream, the head of the thirty-six peaks, the earliest curve of the land, the Celestial Matriarch of Taimu first built her hut there, followed by Zhang Zhan, who entered her chamber to continue her work. Later, the female adepts Yu Daochao and Yu Daoyuan of the Qin era retreated here to seclude themselves. The place was so secluded as to be indescribable, surrounded by thickets of bamboo. Those who came to gather firewood and glimpsed them called them the \"Hairy Women\" after the bamboo, a name that endures to this day.\n\nDuring the Jin, Lou Shizhong, and in the Tang, Xue You, both refined their essence and nurtured their primordial qi here before departing. In our dynasty, it is said that Li Taozhen of Dongjing, Li Tiedi of Luobin, and Li Mojing of Yanshan successively built their hermitages here. Chancellor Li Gang once sought out these three Lis, confirming a dream of snow from his past, intending to construct a \"Hermit’s Pavilion for Officials\" here. Thereafter, generations of nuns resided in the hermitage, naming it Chan Hermitage and the site Chan Cliff.\n\nAlas! Extraordinary figures appear but rarely in the world, and the hermitage fell into ruin, the land overgrown with brambles. Only the name \"Zhi Zhi\" remained, its origins lost to time.\n\nZhan Meizhong, styled Meizhong, a descendant of generations of scholar-officials and a man of heroic spirit, sighed one day: \"Sima Qian explored the Nine Doubts, and Han Yu ascended Mount Taihua—both were moved by antiquity and sighed with emotion. Was this mere love of the strange? In this turbid world, the path of officialdom is fraught with obstacles. Why not cultivate friendships beyond the mundane and pursue the study of cinnabar and mercury? Perhaps one might ascend in flight or achieve liberation in death. The Dao of immortality can be sought—why not strive for it? I do not claim mastery, but I wish to learn.\"\n\nJust then, Bai Yuchan of Qiongzhou emerged from Min and Yue to arrive in Wuyi, harboring the intent to clear the brambles and hew the undergrowth. His aspirations resonated with Zhan Meizhong’s long-held thoughts. Together, they searched for the site of Zhi Zhi Hermitage, sweeping away centuries of untrodden moss and cutting through miles of creeping vines, until they found the place. In the spring of the bingzi year of the Jiading era, they gathered laborers and timber to begin construction.\n\nYet the difficulties of founding were great. Before long, Bai Yuchan departed for Tiantai and Yandang. Upon his return, the hermitage was completed. Meizhong wished to persuade him to stay, arranging the hermitage as a retreat for the three Lis. But Yuchan, wary of the comings and goings of officials in their crimson robes, with their carriages and steeds, which would disrupt his affairs and disturb his mind, said to Meizhong: \"The hermitage is complete thanks to your surplus wealth and effort. In the blink of an eye, halls and chambers have been erected—who but a master of thunderous skill could achieve this? Now, select those who are steadfast in the Dao, patient in spirit, content with simplicity, and fond of tranquility to reside here. Let them cultivate the land for a few seasons, and the flowers and trees will flourish. As for me, I shall enter seclusion on Luofu Mountain, but I will return to reside here permanently.\"\n\nMeizhong replied, \"So be it.\" Then he said, \"Since you are leaving first, will you not write a record of this hermitage for me, to pledge your return in the future?\"\n\nYuchan replied, \"Very well.\"\n\nThis hermitage leans against Manting Peak, faces Huxiao Rock, with Tianzhu Peak to its left and Tieguai Peak to its right. A few steps inward lies Zhu Xi’s Hall of Humaneness and Wisdom; a single call outward reaches the Temple of the True Assembly of Prince Wei. Nearby stands Chongyou Abbey, with its hundreds of corridors and dozens of storied pavilions, their jade tablets and brocade cases filled with imperial calligraphy, their jeweled caskets and jade coffers storing the remains of immortals. The great monastery of the Golden Body of Great Cloud stands beside Zhi Zhi Hermitage.\n\nBehind it, waterfalls cascade from cliffs a thousand fathoms high, like melting snow; before it, the emerald stream brims with waters where dragons bathe. Above lies the Heaven-Mirroring Pool, which connects to the Weak Waters; below lies the Cave of Ascending Perfection, which leads to Penglai. Among the thousand peaks and ten thousand ravines of Wuyi, the myriad mountains and rivers—none surpass the splendor of Zhi Zhi Hermitage.\n\nHere, clouds veil jade grottoes, mist shrouds gemstone forests; purple cypress seals cinnabar, clear springs wash jade. Gibbons follow feathered adepts, cranes cry over fields of lingzhi. A single note from an iron flute gathers the immortals of the grass; three cups from a conch shell evoke the ethereal strains of celestial hymns. Truly, one may sing the hymns of the Purple Void or chant the immortal melodies of jade-winged transcendents. Dust does not obscure the eye; past and present are but a moment. The affairs of the crimson canopy and rainbow bridge remain vivid as ever.\n\nHow wondrous! Green grass, green; a hundred birds sing. Here, one may play the qin at dusk or compose poetry at leisure. Wine may be drunk while gazing at the scenery; without verse, the heart still finds its song. Where do the immortals dwell, so distant and elusive? The Lord of Wuyi resides on the northern slope of the mountain. A lone boat plies the waters, returning whence it came; where to seek the jade flowers that fill the grotto?\n\nIs this not the most secluded and sublime place of Zhi Zhi Hermitage?\n\nZhan Meizhong surely knows that the Jade Emperor will host another banquet, and Bai Yuchan will refine the elixir of seven returns and nine reversions.

      "translated_text": "Should future days bring extraordinary events, they shall but affirm that Zhi Zhi Hermitage was not built in vain.\n\nI recall that in the flourishing years of Yuanyou, a man erected a thatched hut on Huotong Mountain, calling it Jiji. Within a few years, the builder had already shed his mortal form, and the hut itself vanished. Later, during the Longxing era, another sought to restore it; within a year or two, this restorer encountered the original founder—both then ascended as immortals. Such tales are recorded in *Accounts of Immortals Gathered*.\n\nNow, the affairs of Meizhong bear a striking resemblance. For \"zhi zhi\" signifies \"to halt where one ought to halt\"—an idea echoed in the *Zhouyi*'s *Gen* hexagram, which embodies the meaning of twin mountains. This principle elucidates the doctrine of \"zhi zhi,\" while the *Lotus Sutra* speaks of \"zhi zhi, wondrous and beyond thought,\" and Zhuangzi declares: \"An empty chamber gives birth to brightness; auspiciousness resides in *zhi zhi*.\" Thus, across the Three Teachings, *zhi zhi* holds profound significance.\n\nConsider still water as a mirror, the moon as the object of contemplation. One may chant poems of the Six *Zhi*s or compose rhapsodies of the Eight *Zhi*s—indeed, there are those who embody this principle in full. The name *Zhi Zhi* was not idly chosen in antiquity, nor is the hermitage’s revival in our time without purpose. Surely one who has deeply grasped *zhi zhi* now dwells within its walls.\n\nFor green mountains and white clouds are nothing but *zhi zhi*; fallen blossoms and flowing streams are likewise *zhi zhi*. The cries of birds and mournful apes, the desolate moss and broken lichen—all embody the meaning of *zhi zhi*. Those yet unable to attain *zhi zhi* may study under one who has already realized it, for in every action—walking, standing, sitting, or lying—there exists an unceasing *zhi*, far beyond the mere chatter of withered wood or cold ashes.\n\nI, too, am one of the *zhi zhi* company. In recording the people of this hermitage, I join them in entering the *zhi zhi* samadhi, offering reverence to the Three Pure Ones of the Highest Heaven and guiding all beings to realize *zhi zhi*.\n\n*Zhi zhi* is not the cessation of *zhi*, but rather the cessation of the cessation of *zhi*—nothing more.\n\nInscribed by Bai Yuchan of Hainan.\nComposed by Zhan Meifu, descendant of Manting of the former wilderness, and great-grandson of Guifeng.",

**Daoling**, styled **Fuhan**:\nBefore Cloud-Brocade Mountain, he refined the Great Elixir,\nand the demons of the Six Heavens shivered to their bones.\nOnce he rode the crane back to the Mystic Bureau,\nmist and rain whispered over the Jade Altar.\n\n**The Second Celestial Master, Successor,**\nnamed **Heng**, styled **Lingzhen**:\nIn the early years of *Guanghe*, the Great Elixir was perfected—\nwhat skill did he lack to serve the Han’s numinous spirits?\nAt midnight, his jade chariot soared through purple dew,\nwhile spring winds and rains filled Yangping.\n\n**The Third Celestial Master, Heir,**\nnamed **Lu**, styled **Gongqi**:\nLaughing, he cast aside the bronze seal as governor of Hanzhong,\nhiding in the mountains, exchanging a peck of rice for divine might.\nWhen Wei troops encamped along the riverbanks,\nwith a flick of his finger, waves surged into a thousand-foot peak.\n\n**The Fourth,**\nnamed **Zi**, styled **Yuanwei**:\nLeaning on his staff, he climbed to the summit of Boyang’s cliffs,\nwhere an old alchemical furnace still locked in evening mist.\nThrough the ages, a pair of dragon-and-tiger stones remained—\nin what year did the Vice Minister ascend as an immortal?\n\n**The Fifth,**\nnamed **Zhaocheng**, styled **Daorong**:\nFrom thousands of miles away, his radiant spirit shone,\nwhile cinnabar ashes chilled and purple clouds congealed.\nTwo tigers returned to the forest, unseen by men;\na few stalks of fungus sprouted where cranes pierced the tomb.\n\n**The Sixth,**\nnamed **Jiao**, styled **Dexin**:\nJade slips of alchemical script hid in a latticed casket,\ncloud-desks flew through the air, cranes trailed their plumes.\nAfter bidding his disciples farewell and departing,\na pale moon fell into the cold pool that night.\n\n**The Seventh,**\nnamed **Zhonghui**, styled **Dechang**:\nIn those years, he fasted and refined the immortal elixir,\nsummoning rain and calling thunder as though in idle play.\nAcross the four seas, disciples received the register of the law—\nlaughing, he took his staff and left for Crane-Crying Mountain.\n\n**The Eighth,**\nnamed **Jiong**, styled **Yanchao**:\nThe moment his cinnabar talismans were inscribed, ghosts and gods wept;\nat ninety, he shed the red dust of the world.\nTo this day, where he built his hut on the cliff,\nphoenixes roost in the green bamboo at midnight.\n\n**The Ninth,**\nnamed **Fu**, styled **Dexin**:\nThe mountains and waters of Shangrao were the finest south of the Yangtze;\nhis monastic staff flew sideways, poised to build a hermitage.\nSuddenly, he met a perfected one beyond the mists—\nreturning speechless, he hid among the pines.\n\n**The Tenth,**\nnamed **Zixiang**, styled **Linbo**:\nAs the night deepened, his chamber filled with divine light,\nand the sacred elixir materialized in his palm.\nBeyond the tomb, cranes cried at that moment—\nonly rainbow robes remained to shroud the jade coffin.\n\n**The Eleventh,**\nnamed **Tong**, styled **Zhongda**:\nFor forty years, he shut his door and concentrated his spirit;\na green phoenix and red simurgh bore his cloud-borne carriage.\nFor months, his jade coffin held a golden body, translucent—\nhis chamber brimmed with celestial fragrance, a single cup of wine.\n\n**The Twelfth,**\nnamed **Zhongchang**, styled **Derun**:\nSummoned by crane-script to the imperial capital,\nhe returned to divide his form and transform into a radiant being.\nLast night, drunk, he spewed wine—\nawakening, he sipped again from the jar’s spring brew.\n\n**The Thirteenth,**\nnamed **Guang**, styled **Dezhao**:\nFor years, he fasted and studied flight,\npiercing the autumn sky with a single speck of blue.\nAs dusk fell over the forest on a wind-and-moonlit night,\nthe *Step-in-Void* chant echoed faintly from the grotto-heaven.\n\n**The Fourteenth,**\nnamed **Cizheng**, styled **Ziming**:\nHis alchemical crucible could dry quicksilver to life,\nand with a single thought, he fed the poor of his household.\nIn the void, he struck up the *Cloud-Soaring* music—\nwhite cranes arrived amid the wind and rain of spring.\n\n**The Fifteenth,**\nnamed **Gao**, styled **Shilong**:\nOn the Elixir Terrace, a jade-bearded elder—\nthe Celestial Master Zhang Shilong through the ages.\nHe toyed with rivers and mountains in poetic art,\nexhaling and inhaling wind and moon in wine’s divine power.\n\n**The Sixteenth,**\nnamed **Yingshao**, styled **Zhifeng**:\nAlone, he tilled a field of idle clouds,\nhis thatched hut silent as he recited the *Yellow Court*.\nLater, he spoke of fasting and returning to the mountains—\non moonlit nights, the sound of an iron flute was heard.\n\n**The Seventeenth,**\nnamed **Shun**, styled **Zhongfu**:\nA magistrate of Guixi, he hid in his mountain home,\nquietly building a thatched hut with two or three idle days.\nOn the day of his corpse-liberation at ninety,\npeople still saw him with the face of a youth.\n\n**The Eighteenth,**\nnamed **Shiyuan**, styled **Zhongliang**:\nIn the Jade Pool of divine water, he reared white crows;\nin the jade furnace, he stoked the fire to congeal cinnabar.\nThe immortals’ wondrous arts went unrecognized—\nin an instant, he could make peach and plum blossoms bloom.\n\n**The Nineteenth,**\nnamed **Xiu**, styled **Dezhen**:\nThe Jade Bureau’s jade scrolls bore dragon-and-phoenix script,\nand the Three Primes’ ordination drew scholars like clouds.\nTurning, he trod the path to Penglai—\nafter bathing, he burned incense and entered his tomb.\n\n**The Twentieth,**\nnamed **Chen**, styled **Jiande**:\nIn a single breath, he drained the wine sea,\nwearing the cap and robes of the Primordial Altar for over a century.\nUnfed by the world’s smoke and fire,\nhe could transmit the celestial script of lightning flowers.\n\n**The Twenty-First,**\nnamed **Bingyi**, styled **Wenfu**:\nA golden tortoise entered his belly in a dream, leaving him perplexed—\nin the jade chamber, a banished immortal was born.\nFor over a hundred years, the elixir passed through the ancestral seal;\nwhen he took up the tablet to return to the immortals, the earth quaked.\n\n**The Twenty-Second,**\nnamed **Shan**, styled **Yuanchang**:\nHe visited famous mountains and paid homage to grotto-heavens,\nonly to meet living immortals along the way.\nOn the day he returned, his bones transformed and his yang revived—\ncounting on his fingers, ninety years had passed in the mortal world.\n\n**The Twenty-Third,**\nnamed **Jiwen**, styled **Zhonggui**:\nWith a jade bowl, he prayed over water, stirring waves and clouds;\nbeneath his brush, thunder roared, making ghosts and gods weep.\nBefore and behind Dragon-Tiger Mountain,\nhow many had the Master brought back to life?\n\n**The Twenty-Fourth,**\nnamed **Zhengsui**, styled **Baoshen**:\nHe dwelled in the misty waters of plows and harrows,\nbuilding a thatched hut beyond the high pines.\nBestowed the title *True Serenity Master*—\none lane of immortal scriptures, one stove of incense.\n\n**The Twenty-Fifth,**\nnamed **Qianyao**:\nGrasping his *zhenna* staff, he entered the grotto-heaven,\nwhere the grotto-heaven lay vast, veiled in cold mist.\nEmperor Renzong personally inquired about the golden elixir’s secret—\nlaughing, he pointed to the slanting sun and the clamor of cicadas.\n\n**The Twenty-Sixth,**\nnamed **Sizong**:\nIn a cinnabar crucible, he refined golden essence,\nsilently praying to the Celestial Sovereign to ascend the purple void.\nAs the moon sank halfway down the mountain, the Elixir Well’s waters—\nthe cries of gibbons startled the stars across the sky.\n\n**The Twenty-Seventh,**\nnamed **Xiangzhong**, styled **Gongchen**:\nWhen the benevolent emperor

How could I, a mere youth with no knowledge of protecting my own feathers, dare to embellish my words? In truth and sincerity, on this auspicious day, I prostrate myself and present this memorial, offering it to the Three Heavenly Bureaus.\n\nAccording to the records of the disciples of the Supreme Three and Five Meritorious Works and the Orthodox Unity Alliance威, the devotees Shi and others have each already submitted their heart-vows to the Heavenly Court, beseeching transmission and initiation.

A day was then chosen to establish the altar, split the talismans, break the contracts, assign generals, and command troops, dividing responsibilities and appointing officials. Thereafter, the elixir hall and jade scriptures were employed to transmit the heart-mantras and oral instructions.\n\nNow, with united sincerity, we respectfully select this day of the present month to ascend the Wuyi Mountains’ Ascendant True and Mysterious Transformation Grotto-Heaven, where we shall perform a several-part Pure Offering of Thanksgiving to the Lofty Perfected of the Three Realms, inviting the exalted Perfected to repay the mysterious creation, and further praying for blessings upon both our own persons and those of your subjects.\n\nIn my foolishness, I venture to present my humble insights to Your Celestial Majesty. There are seven great difficulties for those who practice the Dao, and six profound terrors—why is this so?\n\nFirst, the world’s customs are degenerate, moral teachings have collapsed, and the deluded point blindly at one another—this is the difficulty of encountering a true teacher, hence the first great difficulty.\n\nSecond, texts are riddled with errors, methods are contradictory, steps are misplaced in presentation, and phrases are omitted in measurement—this is the difficulty of obtaining the true method, hence the second great difficulty.\n\nThird, precepts and prohibitions are strict and clear, statutes are stern and solemn, yet they are hard to practice and easy to violate, leading many to stray from the truth—this is the difficulty of upholding the true precepts, hence the third great difficulty.\n\nFourth, the alchemical fire scorches harmony, lewd winds incite goodness to decay, the upright qi is severed and lost, and the primordial essence withers—this is the difficulty of preserving the true qi, hence the fourth great difficulty.\n\nFifth, the majestic demeanor of the exalted Perfected, the attire and colors of the divine generals, are hard to contemplate in the square inch of the heart, and a single impure thought disrupts them—this is the difficulty of maintaining true visualization, hence the fifth great difficulty.\n\nSixth, the celestial deities and earthly spirits, with their upright majesty, oversee merit and establish standards, scrutinizing even the finest detail—this is the difficulty of cultivating a true heart, hence the sixth great difficulty.\n\nSeventh, whether at dawn or dusk, in cold or heat, when urgent petitions arise, one must respond without daring to be negligent in seeking reward, and all the more must exert oneself—this is the difficulty of establishing true merit, hence the seventh great difficulty.\n\nAs for the six profound terrors: Should the transmitted scriptures, talismans, seals, and mantras be recklessly shown to the unworthy, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Wind-and-Thunder Hell, where blades will rend the body—this is the first profound terror.\n\nShould the received precepts be violated at inopportune times, and external defilements encroach, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Ash Pool Hell, where flames will brand the body—this is the second profound terror.\n\nShould one revere the Three Treasures and pay homage to the numinous Perfected without knowing the taboos, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Fire Net Hell, where wind-knives will torment the body—this is the third profound terror.\n\nShould the divine generals’ incense and fire be neglected day and night, and their summoning lack proper timing, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Frigid Ice Hell, where yellow ropes will bind the neck—this is the fourth profound terror.\n\nShould the mind be careless or heavy, affairs be handled with inconsistency, or one be diligent at times and lazy at others, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Iron Pellet Hell, where iron oxen will plow the tongue—this is the fifth profound terror.\n\nShould one’s practice of the Dao become manifest and bribes be offered, leading to greed and avarice, one will inevitably incur the retribution of the Dark Hell, where myriad sufferings will assail the body—this is the sixth profound terror.\n\nWhen considering these seven great difficulties and six profound terrors, your subject’s shoulders shrink, his heart aches, and his nose stings. I, a single dull and mediocre man, rely entirely on the compassion of the Supreme, which permits your subjects to bare our livers and spill our gall, confessing our sins and faults, praying that any transgressions may be pardoned and absolved.\n\nRegarding the aforementioned disciples who have received the transmission, I humbly beseech Your Sagely Compassion to deign to issue a decree, granting my petition and entrusting it to the Supreme Mystery Capital Department for verification. The previous and subsequent submissions should then be promptly reported to all relevant offices and subordinate bureaus. I further pray for the command to dispatch the generals and marshals required in the Dao, who shall lead troops and command officials, arriving in due course at the ritual altars, incense halls, and administrative precincts of the ritual officers named so-and-so, where they shall station themselves to defend and protect, awaiting summons.\n\nWhen troops follow the seal’s command and generals proceed with the talisman’s authority, in every instance of ritual practice, they shall dispatch talismanic orders in accordance with the statutes. Through prayers and exorcisms, the great numinous efficacy shall be manifested, retributions shall be made clear, names shall be inscribed in the Jade Register, ranks shall be assigned to the Golden Roster, and they shall receive the authority to command troops and wield the power to oversee the governance of spirits and demons. They shall act as Heaven’s agents to transform, serve the state to save the people, slay demons, eliminate evil, and establish the upright.\n\nShould this be granted, I shall be both overjoyed and startled, spurring myself to diligence in body and mind, privately accumulating merit. When three thousand merits are complete and eight hundred deeds are perfected, I shall ascend to the immortal capital, awaiting promotion and selection. The ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears shall together attain good merit, and the six paths and three realms shall universally partake of good fruits.\n\nYour subject, in his foolishness, respectfully relies upon the Two Officials’ Direct Affairs Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Yin-Yang Divine Central Clerks, the Wind-Riding Courier Clerks, the Post-Horse Memorial Clerks, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry Clerks—two of each—to carry out their duties.\n\nFor the sake of the devotees Shi and others, who have advanced to the ritual altar for transmission and initiation, your subject presents this vermilion memorial of confession, thanksgiving, and petition, offering it to the Three Heavenly Bureaus. It is respectfully submitted to the Supreme Void Primordial Master’s Palace and the Supreme Clarity Bureau’s Purple Numen Palace, with the hope that it may be reported.",

We prepare offerings of jujubes, chestnuts, cypress, and pine, gazing upward to the star altars of maple, locust, and willow. We establish the breaking of *jia* and *geng* days, discerning the configurations of *ce* and *kui*; we pace the *kan* and *li* of *zi* and *wu*, stepping through the rhythms of dark and new moons. With heartfelt words, we read aloud before the Dragon Countenance, praying that the Sagely Mind may deign to regard this humble ant-like memorial.\n\nWe reverently consider the Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Central Heaven Grand Emperor: Your Majesty’s Dao rivals that of the Primordial Beginning, and your virtue aligns with the August Heaven. From the misty palace, you govern with effortless grace; from the frosty terrace, you bestow ranks. The Radiant Yang Great Sage assists with the *Lian Zhen* and *Wu Qu* stars; the Yin Essence Luminous Lord collaborates with the *Wen Qu* and *Lu Cun* stars. You wield the handle of fortune and misfortune with clarity, and the power of life and death is concealed within the Hidden Origin. The *Po Jun* star holds the honored position of the Water Palace, while the Northern Culmen governs the administration of the celestial river. All misfortunes are dispelled, and all sins are confessed; no illness remains uncured, and no evil goes unvanquished.\n\nYour subject, the Daoist of Chongyou Abbey in Wuyi Mountain, Wufeng County, who oversees the ritual affairs of devotee Shi, has been graced to belong to humanity and fortunate to receive sagely transformation. Yet, born of mortal flesh and dwelling in the fiery prison of worldly toil, the six roots have incurred transgressions of desire and attachment, while the three karmas have led to the retributions of delusion. The eight trigrams have offended the directions and boundaries, and the five phases fear the changes of destiny’s cycles. The Three Officials pursue the soul, and the Four Bureaus record faults. Afflictions and misfortunes accumulate, illnesses and adversities linger. We now lay bare our foolish hearts and presumptuously beseech the Celestial Hearing.\n\nMay the radiance of jade illuminate and the brilliance of jasper shine forth. May the Spirit Kings of the Startled Ram expel the calamities of the life palace; may the Messengers of the *Tāluó* extend the years and repay the months’ vows. May the sixty officials of the Northern Dipper swiftly eradicate the seven harms and eight difficulties; may the seven thousand divine generals of the Southern Mound thunderously strike the nine perils and three disasters. Within the Dipper’s celestial bowl, may demonic influences be slain and disasters cease; beyond the steps of the Great Unity, may venomous toxins vanish without trace. May the Celestial Pass soar at dawn, and the Cinnabar Origin merge with the luminous scene. May the Dark and Mysterious expel the afflictions of epidemics, and the Jade Light extinguish the calamities of water and fire. May the assaults of malevolent spirits and earthly *qi* be repelled, and the arrows of the Life-Recording Turtle Lord be corrected. May the registers of Fengdu be erased, and the names in the Mountain Bureaus be removed. May the talismans of official misfortune, illness, and slander instantly perish; may the obstacles of retribution, karma, and affliction henceforth be driven away. May the healing officials of the Dharma bestow the medicines of the Six Dawns from the Brahma Palace; may the Heavenly Physicians descend the nine-times-refined elixirs from the Immortal Capital. May the five *qi* circulate freely, and the six pulses be at peace; may the three palaces ascend and descend, and the seven fluids flow harmoniously. May the constructive and defensive *qi* be tranquil, the meridians and collaterals unobstructed. May the *Gou Chen* conceal its luminous scene, and the Florid Canopy hide its form. We offer water and present flowers, our devotion boundless.\n\nWith our feet treading the earth and our heads touching the heavens, we pray for your mighty flood of blessings. We humbly present this memorial, earnestly awaiting your enlightened response.\n\nWith utmost reverence and trepidation, your subject prostrates and kowtows, respectfully submitting this memorial.\n\nOn a day in the first month of the ninth year of Jiading, the *bing-zi* year, your disciple of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Precious Register, the Five Thunder Three Offices Judging Official, and the Director of the Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Demons, your subject Bai, submits this memorial.\n\nYour subject, surnamed Bai, a candidate for immortality selected by the Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal and promoted as a presented scholar, now stationed at the ritual altar, prostrates upon the earth to await your command.\n\nThis vermilion memorial of confession, thanksgiving, and petition for transmission and initiation is respectfully submitted to the Orthodox Unity of the Great Mystery Capital, the Celestial Master of the Balanced *Qi* Lineage, the South Marchmount Master of the Qingwei Heavenly Transformed *Qi*, and the Perfected of the Red Emperor: the Vice Envoy of the Five Thunders of the Divine Empyrean Jade Mansion, and your disciple of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scriptures Register, your subject [so-and-so], kowtows twice and respectfully addresses this:\n\nWe humbly submit that memorials and petitions open the gates of confession and thanksgiving, while soaring spirits and riding *qi* pave the path to audience and reverence.",

      "translated_text": "The transmission of the true and the initiation into the wondrous serve to inherit the wind of the Orthodox Unity; the advancement in rank and ascension in grade follow the method of recommendation and selection; the propagation of the Dao and the dissemination of transformation serve to expound the teachings of exorcism and salvation; the eradication of evil and the establishment of rectitude serve to uphold the Way of purity and forthrightness.\n\nIf this disciple may speak: when the heart’s square inch remains turbid, how can one grasp the clarity of the Dao? When the oral instructions and methods fail to manifest efficacy, how can one know the exorcistic and salvific power of the teachings? When words and deeds lack purity, how can one understand the laws of recommendation and selection? When the true and the false remain undistinguished, how can one recognize the wind of the Orthodox Unity? When form and spirit fail to merge in perfect harmony, how can one know the path of audience and reverence? When the deluded and foolish remain unenlightened, how can one comprehend the gates of confession and thanksgiving? Such are the unchanging principles.\n\nThis disciple has thus come to understand: only after purifying the heart and confessing one’s transgressions may one submit memorials and petitions; only after concentrating the mind and gathering the spirit may one soar in spirit and ride the *qi*; only after disciplining the heart and studying the Dao may one transmit the true and initiate the wondrous; only after rectifying the heart and sincerely aligning the will may one advance in rank and ascend in grade; only after dedicating the heart to benefiting all beings may one propagate the Dao and disseminate transformation; only after cleansing the heart and purifying the self may one eradicate evil and establish rectitude. Does Your Majesty deem this correct, or not?\n\nThe reason this disciple submits memorials and petitions arises from the vast and empty void, and as for soaring in spirit and riding the *qi*, there is no other cause—save that within this defiled and evil world, on behalf of Your Majesty, I have selected the worthy and chosen the virtuous, and among them, there is but one who, if initiated into the transmission of the true and the wondrous, may advance in rank and ascend in grade, propagate the Dao and disseminate transformation, eradicate evil and establish rectitude. Should there be even the slightest merit or the smallest virtue, it would suffice to slightly aid the governance of Heaven. Though this be this disciple’s achievement, it is entirely Your Majesty’s work.\n\nIn this manner, the Dao and its methods are glorified, and in this manner, the customs of the world are guided. Clearly manifest before the eyes and ears of humans and gods, a single memorial of tribute is presented, ascending to the Three Heavenly Bureaus. Reverently, for the Nine Purple Palaces of the Li Mansion, in the celestial region of the Dipper and Ox, in the Great Song Empire, the disciple [so-and-so], whose life is bound to the command of [such-and-such] and whose destiny is tied to [such-and-such] star, affiliated with the Celestial Master of [such-and-such] *qi* lineage in [such-and-such] realm, states: summoned by the Three Black Lords of the Middle Prime Festival, this day, with reverent offerings of incense and tokens, I kowtow and present myself at the Dao to make this declaration.\n\nI humbly reflect that, though undeserving, I have dwelt in this flourishing age and gained entry into the realm of the mysterious; though unworthy, I have been admitted to the ranks of the ordained and been fortunate to transmit the teachings and methods. Though I have diligently studied, I have yet to awaken to the numinous truth. Having had the good fortune to encounter a master’s guidance, I now bind my thoughts and prostrate myself in earnest, baring my heart and swearing an oath to Heaven. I beseech the transmission of the *Nine Numinous Flying Steps Memorial Method* of the celestial realm, that I may ascend in spirit and submit memorials, presenting myself in audience and reverence. Moreover, I sigh with self-reproach, for such rare opportunities are difficult to encounter. I also seek the transmission of the *Great Method of the Purple Pivot, Jade Dawn, Cavern Yang, and Flying Sanskrit Refining Salvation* of the Most High, to summon and command hidden spirits and perform the rites of refinement and salvation.\n\nHaving submitted this memorial, and having performed the rites of refinement, if there are exorcisms to be done, how shall efficacy be attained? I further request the transmission of the *Great Method of the Five Thunders of the Most High*, to pray for rain and beseech clear skies, to summon winds and call forth snow, to seal mountains and breach caves, to fell temples and expel evil, to sever dragons and subdue tigers, to drive away drought demons and sweep away locusts, to heal illnesses and avert disasters, to reward the good and punish the wicked. With utmost sincerity in every step and gesture, I vow to transmit the true oral instructions with a sincere heart.\n\nIn accordance with the words of this petition, no concealment is permitted. Previously, I had it transcribed and submitted to the Capital Bureau, and it has already been presented to the Celestial Court. Should my name be inscribed in the Jade Register, my rank will surely be recorded in the Golden Roster. A day shall be chosen to establish the altar and transmit the methods, following the rituals to dispatch generals and exchange troops, drinking the blood of the covenant and breaking the rings to sever the bonds. Yet I fear that at the moment of the oath and during the transmission, when I assess my own worth, I find my heart filled with shame. Should I, by some chance, profane the true and incur punishment, I have repeatedly presented my case before the Emperor to plead my circumstances. Considering this foolish and base one’s ignorance and transgressions, I rely on Your boundless mercy to grant forgiveness.\n\nThis disciple, burdened by the sins of seven lifetimes and the errors of three generations, beseeches the opening of the Gate of Immaculacy to allow a path for renewal. Pursuing the wondrous meaning of the true methods, I study to attain the state of the subtle and the imperceptible; refining stillness and concentrating emptiness, my heart naturally attains purity. With diligence, I lead the people and transform the realm, aspiring to ascend as an immortal and deliver the world, roaming freely. May my seven generations of ancestors be delivered, and may all the generals and officials of the various bureaus be honored with promotions. May the Three Realms receive grace, and may the myriad spirits attain blessings. Were it not for the great unfolding of compassion by the Most High, how could this humble disciple presume to submit this petition?\n\nThis disciple, in all humility, commands the two officials of the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Decision Clerks, the Wind-Presenting Cavalry Clerks, the Memorial-Submitting Posthorse Clerks, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry Clerks—each to dispatch two officers. This disciple, on behalf of [so-and-so], respectfully submits this vermilion memorial of confession, thanksgiving, and petition for transmission and initiation, to be presented to the Three Heavenly Bureaus, and requests its delivery to the Palace of the Supreme Void Primordial Man of the Grand Tenuity Bureau and the Purple Cloud Palace of the Grand Tenuity Court. May it be duly reported.\n\nThis disciple, with utmost reverence and trepidation, kowtows twice and respectfully addresses this to the Supreme Void Primordial Man, the Great Dao Lord of the Grand Tenuity Primordial Ultimate; the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Primordial Man; the Heavenly Emperor, the Heavenly Primordial Man; the Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis, the Nine *Qi* Primordial Men; and the myriad officials of the Grand Tenuity Jade Court of Your Majesty.\n\nOn the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month of the year of the Great Year Star, the memorialist, your subject [so-and-so] of the White surname, a Selected Immortal Graduate of the Jade Emperor’s Golden Gate, presently awaiting your command at the Chongyou Abbey, respectfully submits this.\n\n*Memorial of Merit Discussion at the Thunder Bureau*\nTo the Orthodox Unity of the Great Mystery Capital, the Celestial Master of the Balanced *Qi* Lineage, the South Marchmount Master of the Qingwei Heavenly Transformed *Qi*, and the Perfected of the Red Emperor: your disciple of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scriptures Register, [so-and-so] of the White surname, kowtows twice and respectfully addresses this.\n\nThis disciple is a minor clerk of the Divine Empyrean’s Thunder Bureau, somewhat versed in the affairs governed by thunder, unworthily bearing the books bestowed by thunder, and well-acquainted with the methods enacted by thunder.",

      "translated_text": "Yet in their inquiries, records may err, transmissions may stray; thus amid complexity, guidance is offered, amid error, correction is made—obscure points yield their secrets, subtle ones their measures—difficult to know yet easy to practice, difficult to transmit yet easy to learn. What this disciple has mastered has reached this point, and I now lay it all before Your August Presence.\n\nI have heard that when the two *qi* of yin and yang coalesce, they form thunder, and with the advent of thunder and lightning, departments and jurisdictions were divided. The Nine Heavens’ Thunder Ancestor thereby distinguished the Five Attributes, while the Perfected True King of the Divine Empyrean employed them to govern the Three Realms. Yet when I examine the Golden Tripod and consult the Jade Registers, I find that regarding the Five Thunders, doubts persist.\n\nThe *Thunder Writ of the Jade Pivot* states: the first is Heavenly Thunder, the second is Divine Empyrean Thunder, the third is Water Bureau Thunder, the fourth is Dragon Thunder, and the fifth is Earth Altar Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Divine Empyrean* states: the first is Wind Thunder, the second is Fire Thunder, the third is Mountain Thunder, the fourth is Water Thunder, and the fifth is Earth Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Great Cavern* states: the first is the Sagely Fullness, Numinous Might, Quaking Thunder; the second is the Roaring, Howling, Thunderclap Thunder; the third is the Eight Numinous, Eight Fierce, Shaoyang Thunder; the fourth is the Wave-Rolling Water Thunder; and the fifth is the Upright Thunderclap, Lightning Flash, Great Cavern Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Immortal Capital* states: the first is Heavenly Thunder, the second is Earthly Thunder, the third is Wind Thunder, the fourth is Mountain Thunder, and the fifth is Water Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Northern Culmen* states: the first is Dragon Thunder, the second is Earth Thunder, the third is Divine Thunder, the fourth is Earth Altar Thunder, and the fifth is Demon Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Great Unity* states: the first is the Eastern Azure *Qi* Wood Thunder, the second is the Southern Vermilion *Qi* Fire Thunder, the third is the Western White *Qi* Metal Thunder, the fourth is the Northern Dark *Qi* Water Thunder, and the fifth is the Central Yellow *Qi* Earth Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Purple Palace* states: the first is Spring Thunder, the second is Summer Thunder, the third is Autumn Thunder, the fourth is Winter Thunder, and the fifth is the Xuanyuan Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Jade Dawn* states: the first is Purple Tenuity Thunder, the second is Dengdu Thunder, the third is Fusang Thunder, the fourth is Mountain Bureau Thunder, and the fifth is City God Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Great Empyrean* states: the first is Jia-Yi Thunder, the second is Bing-Ding Thunder, the third is Wu-Ji Thunder, the fourth is Geng-Xin Thunder, and the fifth is Ren-Gui Thunder. The *Thunder Writ of the Great Ultimate* states: the first is Divine Empyrean Thunder, the second is Earth Prison Thunder, the third is Water Bureau Thunder, the fourth is Nine Provinces Thunder, and the fifth is Village Earth Altar Thunder.\n\nThe thunder writs transmitted by the Most High, as recorded in the ten preceding texts, each differ in their accounts. Which of the ancient Five Thunders is to be regarded as correct? Even the thirty-six thunders handed down through the ages remain doubtful—indeed, they invite further scrutiny.\n\nThe thirty-six thunders are as follows: first, Jade Pivot Thunder; second, Jade Treasury Thunder; third, Heavenly Divination Jade Pillar Thunder; fourth, Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Thunder; fifth, Fire Wheel Thunder; sixth, Dipper-Infusing Thunder; seventh, Wind-Fire Thunder; eighth, Flying Swift Thunder; ninth, Northern Culmen Thunder; tenth, Purple Tenuity Pivot Thunder; eleventh, Divine Empyrean Thunder; twelfth, Immortal Capital Thunder; thirteenth, Great Unity Heaven-Shaking Thunder; fourteenth, Purple Palace Thunder; fifteenth, Iron Armor Thunder; sixteenth, Shaoyang Thunder; seventeenth, Reverent Fire Thunder; eighteenth, Earth Altar Commanding Demon Thunder; nineteenth, Earth Spirit Fire Crow Thunder; twentieth, Three Realms Thunder; twenty-first, Grave-Severing Thunder; twenty-second, Great Awesome Virtue Thunder; twenty-third, Six Waves Thunder; twenty-fourth, Green Grass Thunder; twenty-fifth, Eight Trigrams Thunder; twenty-sixth, Primordial Unity Hawk and Hound Thunder; twenty-seventh, Whistling Mandate Wind and Thunderclap Thunder; twenty-eighth, Fire Cloud Thunder; twenty-ninth, Yu’s Step Great Unity Commanding Thunder; thirtieth, Great Ultimate Thunder; thirty-first, Sword-Tip Thunder; thirty-second, Inner Mirror Thunder; thirty-third, Outer Mirror Thunder; thirty-fourth, Divine Treasury Heavenly Pivot Thunder; thirty-fifth, Great Brahma Dipper Pivot Thunder; and thirty-sixth, Jade Dawn Thunder.\n\nIs this truly what is meant by the thirty-six thunders? Or is it not? If the Five Thunders alone are so manifold, how much more so the thunder methods? Are these the extraordinary and wondrous techniques wielded by divine immortals and perfected beings? Or do the discrepancies arise from inconsistencies in the records of the scriptures and registers?\n\nConsider the deities of the thirty-six thunders: the Celestial Cavern Heavenly Perfected Deities, the Complete Fire Complete Perfected Deities, the Heavenly Raven Heavenly Guard Deities, the Mighty Ding-Xin Deities, the Ice Wheel Water Bowl Deities, the Flowing Light Fire Wheel Deities, the Dripping Past Shouting *Ka* Deities, the Great Unity Primordial August Deities, the Biting Net Sparrow-Tongued Deities, the Heavenly Thunder Wind-Leading Deities, the Fire Hound *Qi* Hound Deities, the Fire Eagle Fishy Smoke Deities, the Heavenly Pass Thunderclap Deities, the Iron Armor Flying Lightning Deities, the Immortal Capital Fire Thunder Deities, the Mountain Thunder Fire Cloud Deities, the Wind-Fire Primordial Brightness Deities, the Fire Earl Wind and Thunderclap Deities, the Gou-Lou Auspicious Benefit Deities, the Weaving Maiden Four Songs Deities, the Jade Thunder Vast Master Deities, the Cavern Yang Hidden Numinous Deities, the Four Brightnesses Public Guest Deities, the Fire Light Flowing Essence Deities, the Void-Riding Great Flower Deities, the Metal Essence Pure Thought Deities, the Azure Fang Iron-Faced Deities, the Scattering Smoke Thunderclap *Qi* Deities, the Thunder Master Pass Earl Deities, the Wood Wolf Astral Light Deities, the Reverent Fire Statutes and Mandates Deities, the Shaoyang Fire Chariot Deities, the Wolf Fang Fierce Officials, the Six Waves Rolling Water Deities, the Flying Eagle Running Hound Deities, and the Flowing Metal Fire Bell Deities.\n\nAre these the thirty-six deities—or are they the thirty-six thunders?

      "translated_text": "Now, as collated from the *Cinnabar Empyrean Scripture of Radiance*, the Winnowing Basket Star governs the celestial thunders; the Chamber Star governs the terrestrial thunders; the Straddling Star governs the aqueous thunders; the Ghost Star governs the numinous thunders; and the Bond Star governs the demonic thunders. The celestial thunders pertain to the Winnowing Basket Star, hence the deities of the Celestial Crow, Celestial Garrison, Celestial Cavern, and Celestial Perfection. The terrestrial thunders pertain to the Chamber Star, hence the deities of the Thunder Master, Pass Earl, Fire Earl, and Wind Thunder. The aqueous thunders pertain to the Straddling Star, hence the deities of the Wood Wolf, Cavern Yang, Metal Essence, and Vast Master. The numinous thunders pertain to the Ghost Star, hence the deities of Reverent Fire, Statutes and Mandates, Shaoyang, and Wolf Fang. The demonic thunders pertain to the Bond Star, hence the deities of Ding Xin, Di Xi, He Lou, and Jia Ye. Thus, I alone regard this as correct.\n\nThe thunder methods transmitted from antiquity to the present comprise several grades, their numinous efficacy and manifest proofs resplendent throughout the world and posterity. Thunder and lightning are things that cannot be concealed—who does not know of their existence? Thunder and lightning serve to manifest the majesty of Heaven and to activate the function of the Dao. If the majesty of Heaven were not manifested, how would the destinies of the hidden and the manifest differ, and who would mete out fortune and misfortune? If the function of the Dao were not activated, how would the two qi of yin and yang execute generation and destruction? When the two qi of yin and yang activate the function of the Dao, they manifest the majesty of Heaven; when the destinies of the hidden and the manifest manifest the majesty of Heaven, they activate the function of the Dao. Thus, rewards are not obscured in darkness, nor are punishments concealed in calamity.\n\nAs for the altars of the earth gods and the ranks of the local deities, these are all sacrifices; the numinous platforms and ancient traces are all spirits and gods. Among them, there must be both kindness and malevolence. The wealthy chambers and humble servants all partake in sustenance; the upright and the deceitful are all of the same generation. Among them, there must be both good and evil. If spirits and gods commit offenses, to whom shall the generation appeal? If the generation incurs transgressions, how shall spirits and gods make their grievances known?\n\nAlas! It is for this reason that August Heaven establishes the Thunder Citadel, sets up the Thunder Prison, appoints the Thunder Officials, divides the Thunder Governances, dispenses the Transformations of Thunder, displays the Punishments of Thunder, employs the Thunder Spirits, commands the Thunder Soldiers, exerts the Might of Thunder, and wields the Instruments of Thunder—all to grasp the handle of reward and punishment and to hold the power of generation and destruction. In the yin realm, these may seal mountains, breach caverns, slay demons, and restrain toxins; in the yang realm, they may eliminate the inauspicious, execute the rebellious, punish the treacherous, and slaughter the cruel. Thus are the functions of the Dao activated and the majesty of Heaven manifested. Here, the two qi of yin and yang attain their proper deployment, and the destinies of the hidden and the manifest achieve their responsive effects.\n\nWithin Heaven and Earth, the myriad things stand established—none fail to receive the yin and yang qi in their ceaseless generation. That which possesses form and thought is human; that which is formless yet possesses thought is a ghost. Humans dwell in the yang; ghosts dwell in the yin. By this, they traverse the Four Modes of Birth and cycle through the Six Paths. Were it not for the thunder and lightning of Heaven, how could punishments be displayed and the obstinate and foolish be corrected?\n\nI, your servant, have been blessed with good fortune since my former existence and have presumptuously joined the ranks of the thunder officials. I have vowed to practice and uphold this without the slightest negligence. On this auspicious day, I prostrate myself and present this memorial, submitting it to the Three Heavenly Courts. I respectfully dispatch the Mute Master of the Wind-Fire Primordial Radiance within the Dharma, the Fire Earl Wind Thunder, the Thunder Master Pass Earl Divine Lord, the Fire Bell Thunderclap Heavenly Immortal, the Azure Fang Iron-Faced Great Immortal, the Dragon Thunder Rolling Water Divine Lord, the Wind-Fire Dragon Rider Heaven-Shaking Sea-Boiling Divine Lord, the Thunderclap Fire Light Silver Fang Dazzling-Eyed Divine Lord, the Reverent Fire Statutes and Mandates Great Spirit, the Thunder Duke Fire Chariot Marshal, the Three-Five Iron-Faced Fire Chariot Great General, the Three-Five Shaoyang Commander-in-Chief General, the Thunderclap Fire Chariot Rank-Smoke Envoy, the Four Sages Hearing and Inspecting Return-Chariot Envoy, the Floating Cloud Descending Hail Valiant, the Horizontal-Body Flying Cloud Envoy, the Mountain-Moving Sea-Overturning Iron-Armored Envoy, the Cavern Wind Drum Heaven-Shaking Might Red Script Envoy, the Wind Hail Metal Bell Fire Bell Envoy, the Five Thunders Flying Swift Envoy, the Thunder Formation Left and Right Envoys, the Scattering Clouds Dispensing Fire Prohibiting Flames Envoy, the Western Terrace Thunder Rain Officer, the Heaven-Bearing Stone-Carrying Grand Tenuity Commanding Might Sword Thunder Spirit Officer, the Four Seasons Wind Rain Command Jade Light Metal Essence Superior Officer, the Demon-Swallowing Demon-Devouring Heavenly Armored Spirit Officer, the Cinnabar Prime Minister of the Ministry of Punishments, the Dragon-Capturing Demon-Seizing Mountain-Shaking Divine Lord, the Sea-Blowing Wave-Raising Numinous Splendor Fierce Officer, the Flying Clouds Running Lightning Spirit Officer, the Grand Year General, the Plague and Pestilence Managing Envoy, the Five Directions Thunder Duke Generals, the Heavenly Thunder Dazzling Light General, the Water Thunder Lightning Flash Six Dragon General, the Left and Right Divine Generals of the Jade Pivot Palace, the Left and Right Divine Generals of the Northern Culmen Palace, the Left and Right Divine Generals of the Penglai Thunder Bureau, the Thirty-Six Thunder Drum Valiants, the Howling Mandate Wind Thunder Great General, the Generals and Commanders of the Various Five Thunders Bureaus, the Officers and Soldiers of the Various Five Thunders Bureaus, and the Five Directions Barbarian Thunder Envoys—all to accompany this memorial to the Capital Palace, where merits and achievements shall be reviewed, diligence and efforts examined. Those recorded shall be promoted; those appointed shall be transferred; those assigned shall be installed; those selected shall be elevated.\n\nOn the *xinhai* day of the twelfth month of this year, I shall command the Five Thunders officials, officers, and soldiers to proceed in advance to the Primordial Response Grand Tenuity Mansion to record merits and inscribe achievements. Furthermore, on the morning of the first day of the *bingzi* year, the first day of the Celestial New Year, they shall ascend directly to the Jade Purity to present themselves in audience and petition. On the seventh day of the third month, they shall be permitted to attend the Heavenly Court’s Selection and Reward Assembly. By the morning of the *jiazi* day of the first month, the dawn of the Grand Unity’s Review of Spirits and Deities, the Five Thunders generals and officers shall each attain a merit. Awaiting the morning of the fifteenth day of the first month, the dawn of the Upper Prime Heavenly Mansion’s bestowal of blessings, they shall all proceed to the Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Pivot Palace to receive their customary promotions, each advancing one rank.\n\nI humbly pray that my ninefold ancestors of the mysterious and my sevenfold ancestors may together attain promotion, and that the spirits and gods of the Three Realms may all partake in blessings and benefits. Thereafter, I vow to pray for clear skies and beseech for rain, to summon snow and raise clouds, to command lightning and call forth thunder, to drive winds and descend hail, to seal mountains and breach caverns, to fell temples and expel demons, to execute and behead dragons, to subdue wolves and tigers, to dispel water and fire, to expel drought and locusts, to exorcise disasters for the people, to drive away evil and cure illnesses, to issue talismanic commands, and to manifest responsive retributions.",

sought, it vanishes.\nWhen the golden rooster crows, none see me,\nOnly the moon’s cold light fills the Great Void.\n\nI know not sutras nor sit in meditation,\nHungry, I eat; weary, I sleep.\nIf the Jade Thearch does not favor me,\nI remain a mortal, my bones untransfigured.\n\nI do not cast my gaze upon the vulgar,\nMy empty self roams the Five Lakes and Four Seas.\nIn the depths of the grotto-heavens, none tread,\nBy the stream, how many springs have the peach blossoms seen?\n\nSeas turn to mulberry fields, fields to seas—\nSuch words are hard to believe.\nYet one thing surpasses me:\nThe king knows not such leisure.\n\n**Inscribed at the Perch of the Phoenix**\n\nBefore the pavilion, jade-like greenery forms dense thickets,\nThe phoenix perches in the branches, mist and rain dissolve into emptiness.\nA single note of flute or pipe, yet none sleep—\nThe bright moon bathes the entire grove in clear wind.\n\nSounds of zither and harp, wind stirs the pillow,\nShadows of jade-like trees spill across the moonlit courtyard.\nA white phoenix alights beyond the branches to roost,\nDeep in the night, it punctures the verdant grove with light.\n\nBamboo has for years tended wind and moon,\nHow many nights has the phoenix lodged in clouds and mist?\nA guest in the grove plays the flute and departs,\nThe bamboo transforms into a dragon, the phoenix ascends to heaven.\n\nAt the Pavilion of the Pan Clan, I drank through the night,\nDrunk, I faced the bamboo and played the jasper flute.\nWho knows how many phoenixes have come?\nThe phoenix gone, the man departed, the bamboo stands desolate.\n\n**Night Discourse at the Pavilion of Pure Excellence**\n\nThe dying lamp blossoms like crimson filling the hall,\nWine’s fervor unspent, poetry’s passion surges.\nCold clouds and moth-like stars seal the emerald sky,\nA grove of bamboo whispers to the night wind.\n\nThe reclusive scholar leans on the tower, whistling like a jade dragon,\nCicadas weep dew, falling upon the parasol trees.\nHand in hand, we discourse on literature, opening our hearts—\nSweet slumber beckons, our words left unfinished.\n\nIncense coils like flying serpents through the curtains,\nNeighboring roosters herald dawn—where is the bell?\nRubbing my drunken eyes, I grasp the railing,\nThe tea kettle cold, I summon the jade youth.\n\nThree companions in straw sandals, seven-foot staffs,\nTread through green mountains, how many layers?\n\n**Night Feast at the Pavilion of Pure Excellence, Presented to Ni Meichuang and Daoist Wu Yinnan**\n\nBefore the mountain, a resounding song—my voice dries,\nA long whistle pierces the Gate of Azure Clouds.\nMaster Meichuang brings a hundred flasks,\nThrough the night we converse, autumn rain turns cold.\n\nLamps glow red, casting jade insects in intricate patterns,\nThe Daoist roars, slapping the bed in laughter.\nSharing a couch, Yinnan and I strike a pact,\nEager to see serpents slither across the paper.\n\nSetting down the cup, I strain my eyes, seized by poetic frenzy,\nSeizing a brush, half-dozing.\nLaughing, I dip Kunlun in the vast sea,\nWriting tens of thousands of new verses.\n\n**Inscribed on the Wall of the Pavilion of Pure Excellence**\n\nTwo rare blossoms, one censer of incense,\nA heart untroubled, thus pure and empty.\nOn the wall, a zither; on the bed, a sword—\nA resounding song, a slow, ethereal chant.\n\nMy aspirations beyond the mundane are inherently refined,\nThe mountain pavilion’s pure excellence suffices for all things.\nI pour myself three or two cups of wine,\nPlay three or two games of uncontentious chess.\n\n**Again Inscribed at the Pavilion of Pure Excellence**\n\nA grove of bamboo whispers in the night wind,\nFrom the southern pole, a single point of cold pierces the void.\nA jade censer exudes rare fragrance, distant as the Jade Palace—\nHere, one knows there dwells an immortal elder.\n\nWithin the Pavilion of Pure Excellence, secluded and exquisite,\nA white-bearded Daoist holds a sandalwood tablet.\nHis brows lift, parting the clouds over the stream,\nHis gaze flashes, shattering the moon atop the peaks.\n\nOn the jasper chamber’s wall hangs a jade zither,\nAfter dancing with the sword, a heart of ancient times.\nParted from Penglai, drunk, I played the flute—\nToday, upon meeting, I sing a long ode.\n\nHeavenly spirits rebuke the Dao, green mist rises,\nBefore me, Wang and Zhao all wear pearl-studded slippers.\nThe weary dragon coils its tail, the green serpent dies—\nWith a flick of the finger, the Milky Way pours forth.",

Jade Flask.\nThe Master of Mount Wuyi delights in poetry and wine—\nOnce I saw you, but now you are gone.\n\n**Inscribed on the Hall of Pure Emptiness**\nThe moon shifts, casting flower shadows beyond the window,\nThe wind carries the sound of pines to the pillow’s edge.\nAfter dancing the long sword, I brew tea and taste it,\nWith a new poem composed, I embrace the zither and sleep.\n\nFresh wine is poured like green snail marrow,\nIncense coils burn like purple horsewhips.\nAt the head of Nine-Bend Stream stands the Temple of Divine Protection—\nWithin the Hall of Pure Emptiness dwells a

family’s robe and bowl are passed to dragons and phoenixes,\nHe himself points to the ice-pure flask, heir to Yingbin.\n\n**Two Poems Presented to the Lazy Old Man**\nAutumn’s mirror reveals stars at my temples,\nEverywhere, streams and mountains are Dongting’s expanse.\nFierce rain strikes the lotus, tilting the green pond,\nA gale snaps the bamboo, flinging it over the wall.\n\nPurple swallows take flight from the water-chestnut isle,\nWhite gulls tuck their necks to sleep on the desolate shoal.\nI don a bamboo hat to seek the Lazy One,\nBringing a breath of crisp air through the

deep, he pours tea to wake.\nAutumn arrives on the wutong branches,\nNight brings the sound of wind and rain.\n\nHis golden body is green as bamboo leaves,\nThe Jade Maiden white as lotus blossoms.\nHearing you are slightly unwell, body freed,\nI lean on my staff, wishing to visit your home.\n\nLotus and herbs resent the wind’s havoc,\nRice seedlings gain spirit from the rain.\nRecalling Mount Wuyi’s Nine Bends,\nLast autumn, I poled a boat along the stream’s edge.\n\nDrunk, I transformed into a butterfly on my pillow,\nAwake, my brush gave birth to serpents.\nLong days, my heart is free of cares,\nWhen hungry, I merely dine on rosy clouds.\n\nAutumn rain recognizes sorrow in segments,\nEvening clouds pass before the eyes like blossoms.\nThe Phoenix Perch Pavilion stands desolate,\nYet Mount Wuyi once had immortals.\n\n**Arriving Drunk at the Lazy Old Man’s Study and Singing**\nFreshly opened white wine, lotus pods bought,\nPoured full, tung oil shines

essence,\nHalf a catty of cloud and mist’s fragments.\nLight as a swan’s feather,\nHeavy as a thousand scales of iron.\n\nWhite as snow in the sky,\nRed as a gibbon’s blood.\nGathered into a jade

this strength to study,\nTo become one of the Tang’s five transcendent sages.\n\n**Matching Lu Gen’an’s Rhyme**\nI once stood at the head of the morning court,\nMy office as cold and clear as autumn skies.\nWind, flowers, snow, moon—worth a thousand gold coins,\nWater, bamboo, clouds, mountains—worth ten thousand households.\n\nThe sea traveler’s pact with gulls remains unbroken,\nThe frontier

sandal teeth,\nStep by step, imprinting the moss’s mottled traces.\n\n**In Hu’s Hidden Hut, Lamenting Spring**\nI leave all creation to *Zhurong*,\nAs the Eastern Emperor returns to *Taihua Palace*.\nMountains stand sharp as green jade,\nWaves shimmer, soaking bronze’s sheen.\n\nWillows reach the sky—doves summon rain,\nCrabapples fall to earth—butterflies shun the wind.\nBest to take staff and sandals to the western garden,\nWhere ten thousand purples and reds vanish in a single night.\n\n**Sending Spring Off from the Lodge of Rest**\nPoems flow naturally from the brush, rich with material,\nHeaven’s craft carves fine mountain streams.\nFish, knowing the water’s warmth, leap without cease,\nOrioles, seeing flowers fly, cry endlessly.\n\nThe tree-top turtledove’s wife calls for rain,\nBamboo behind the hut teaches its shoots to rise from mud.\nAfter ten cups of *Taibai*, one is dead drunk—\nAt the mouth of the Peach Blossom Grotto, the sun sinks west.\n\n**Occasional Lines in Hu’s Winning Hut**\nThe Daoist is used to eating sesame rice,\nArriving in the world—how many years has it been?\nBefore the White Jade Tower, the moon of night is empty,\nAbove the Purple Gold Hall, spring mist rises.\n\nLeisurely, he pours a cup of *Zhonghuang* wine,\nBored, he sweeps a thousand chapters of *Neijing* scriptures.\nLast night, *Zhongli* passed down kind words,\nTeaching me to become an earth-walking immortal for now.\n\n**To Old Fan of Tiantai**\nSince parting, how many springs have startled us?\nMeeting again, we laugh, embracing the southern breeze.\nAshen-faced, dust-covered—no one recognizes us,\nRefusing to eat grass-cloth, disdaining worldly fuss.\n\nIn Zhe’s Tiantai, you’ve long resided,\nYour name, Fan Bing, unknown and obscure.\nI send these new poems to you,\nTo deliver to Zhao Cuiyun of Qianshan.\n\n**To Wu Caoqiu**\nI hear that on Green City Mountain lives Old Hao,\nHis words, entering my ears, now ten years past.\nBy chance, with the carefree traveler and the joyless maiden,\nI came to Tiantai and met him.\n\nHis clothes are plain hemp,\nHis speech all alchemical texts.\nI think you are already over a thousand years old—\nWho says immortals do not exist in this world?\n\n**To Vice Minister Su**\nPast and present shift like shoulders,\nI suspect you are Su Shi reborn.\nThe whole city lacks a single *Bo Le*—\nCould there be a day without a *Le Tian*?\n\nJust now discussing literature, we part abruptly,\nUnknowing when we’ll clasp hands again.\nSuddenly, an iron flute sounds—\nIts notes reach the ancient grottoes of Jinhua.\n\n**Painting of the Heaven-Opened Library Tower**\nLayered eaves rise into the azure void,\nA thousand peaks, ten thousand peaks, sending and welcoming.\nClear clouds, already wiped away, linger unfinished,\nAt the stream’s end, the last glow of sunset gleams.\n\nNature’s craft, morning and night, applies its touches,\nInk and colors shift in depth and hue.\nLeaning on the railing, I stretch my thousand-mile gaze,\nYet grieve that this scroll cannot be fully unfurled.\n\n**To Master Wei**\nI once saw you on Jiuhua Mountain,\nMorning feasting on jade milk and jasper flowers.\nAt night, a deer-horn cap beneath the moon of Green City,\nAt dawn, a crane cloak draped in purple palace mist.\n\nOccasionally, you carry a sword in the human world,\nYet have not taken your zither to the immortals’ home.\nLaughing, we meet amid pines and bamboo,\nBurning incense, sipping tea, sharing new words.\n\n**Visiting Yangzi Cliff**\nHalfway up the sky, autumn wind sighs through ten thousand pines,\nQiang flowers half-fallen in the reddening sunset.\nHermitage smoke veils the ancient immortal altar,\nWild grass hides the empty cinnabar cauldron.\n\nWhere do people gather purple mushrooms?\nI come at noon, yet find no one.\nA single note of flute and pipe—laughing, I raise my sleeves,\nAutumn’s hues fill my breast, my poetic mood thickens.\n\n**After Visiting Yan Cliff, Parting with Its Master**\nThe west wind blows me to this cliff’s wanderings,\nMy eyes brim with emerald pines and bamboos.\nJade swallows do not fly on moonlit nights,\nA stone bell’s chime startles the frosty autumn dawn.\n\nAlas, we part—north and south diverging,\nSuddenly turning back, torn between leaving and staying.\nGo first to the human world to prepare elixir ingredients,\nThen return to the mountain’s peak to build a thatched hut and rest.\n\n**Inscribed on the Shu Family’s *Nan Lao* Pavilion**\nA separate cave-heaven in the human world,\nStalwart pines rise in dense, auspicious mist.\nVirtue like cassia seeds, unaware of the years,\nFortune like flowing water, endless in time.\n\nBefore the *Xuan* grass hall, affairs of a thousand ages,\nAtop the lotus pond, two immortals.\nThe man in *lai* robes, playing with colors, remains unharmed—\nHe weaves all the streams and mountains into green wind and moon.\n\nThe thirty-third heaven’s first day,\nBeneath the Jade Emperor’s palace, wispy smoke curls.",

hand,\nTen fingers strike and pluck like jade’s chime.\nThe tune plays *White Snow* and *Yang Chun*’s mode,\nIts melody the sound of lofty mountains and flowing streams.\nPine tops echo crane cries at midnight’s half,\nCold mist hangs still, the wind’s chill whisper.\nPaper quilt and tile pillow cold as water,\nTossing sleepless, no dream comes.\nRising to scratch my head, I strum one piece,\nChanting done, the autumn moon illumines the mountain.\n\n**Inscribed on the Hermit’s Lodge**\nFine pines, fine bamboos, fine streams and hills,\nCarriages and horses throng, coming and going.\nTravelers hear the new wine’s white froth,\nEntering, they tread through tender moss’s speckled green.\nI say this pure seclusion beyond the world\nIs yet like a bustling marketplace’s clamor.\nValleys’ grain and mulberries fill empty huts,\nThe host attends guests, never idle.\n\n**Rainy Inscription at a Traveler’s Inn**\nWind stirs the vast sky, autumn rain hangs,\nThe road slick as moss, I lazily shake the whip.\nEntering, I bid the servant buy a cup of wine,\nGrind ink, lean by the window, chant a verse.\nYellow bamboo beneath the far eaves, yellow ants war,\nWhite reeds mirror the water where white gulls sleep.\nA long whistle, then I depart,\nTurning back, the lone village fades in evening mist.\n\n**Golden Immortal Pavilion at Immortal Crag**\nCold mist seals the Brahma-king’s abode,\nA single censer’s smoke coils like a coiling snake.\nAutumn rain falls like jade flowers across the sky,\nThe clear stream swells green, submerging level sands.\nAncient pines and jagged rocks vie in height,\nGreen vines drag trees, veiling clouds.\nBamboo roots upturn, crow wings aslant,\nMidnight’s cold wind stirs roosting crows.\nThe wooden fish calls for congee,

fallen blossoms lie unbrushed, even with the moss.\nEnlist the wind as a gate-keeping servant,\nBorrow the moon as a wine-companion.\nHistories and classics hold silent, ancient savor,\nBarriers and

and asleep, I know affairs grow few,\nSeveral chants clear, the heart feels empty.\nThe Indolent Hut keeps no company,\nIts barred brushwood gate holds rich savor.\n\n**Lu Shu-yu’s Pavilion of Pure Poverty**\nUtterly carefree, heedless of heaven,\nAt five *zhang*’s height, the sun lingers, yet he sleeps on.\nStream fish and village wine hold uncommon savor,\nWild greens and mountain grains cost no coin.\nAn urn for a window, a painted gate blocks the narrow path,\nDry firewood and white rice boil in clear spring water.\nSometimes leaning on a staff by the verdant pines,\nHe is the human

crow’s cry traverses the void.\nWho knows the marvel of the heart’s work?\nSeeking a world untouched by worldly burdens.\nHas the ninefold inner elixir formed yet?\nSwiftly ride the white crane to Heaven’s thoroughfare.\n\n**Inscribed on the Wall of the Upper Clarity Method Hall**\n\nAutumn rain hangs from the sky, wind sharpens the cold,\nChill mist seals the mountain above the eaves.\nA bird darts past the half-cliff’s edge,\nSheer crags sever clouds—timeless leisure.\nThe vulgar know not this secluded quiet,\nWhere immortals hide between being and non-being.\nLast night, the skiff’s pole slipped from my grasp,\nDrunk, I cast the frosted rod into the emerald bay.\n\n**Hall of Great Emptiness**\n\nThe hall stands cool and still, refreshing the spirit,\nUnstained by a speck of the human world’s dust.\nEaves magpies clamor in the wind, calling dusk,\nCourtyard blossoms scatter dew, lingering spring’s end.\nThe land of Hua Xu holds no dreams now,\nYet in the Dragon Han’s first kalpa, this body once was.\nIncense smoke drifts beyond the window,\nA lone crane’s cry—who calls from the cloud’s edge?\n\n**Returning Elixir Poems of the Three Flowers Abbey**\n\nThe Crimson Palace lies at ease, free of dust,\nKan’s tiger and Li’s dragon wage countless battles.\nWhite snow flies through the void as lead blooms,\nYellow clouds shroud the crucible as mercury flowers unfold.\nTortoise and

dots the great void.\n\nSpring arrives, traversing lush fields,\nClouds fill the spring sky, water brims the streams.\nWind ripples green waves, barley sways,\nSun shines, red rain falls on peach-lined paths.\nThe cuckoo’s cry fades, startling the cold hare,\nThe butterfly’s dream ends, roused by the dawn cock.\nYou dwell east of the river, sending word home—\nAs crabapple blossoms fade, swallows carry mud.\n\nYou reach Lead Mountain, I remain in Xin Prefecture,\nThe bamboo sedan creaks, then rests once more.\nThrough misty rain and slanting winds, the road winds,\nA scattering of fallen blossoms grieves the cawing crow.\nWhy weep like Ruan Ji?\nCome, wander with Red Pine instead.\nOne day, when I ascend Penglai,\nWill you follow, bearing a grain of golden elixir?\n\n**Sending

game of chess startles the falling glow.\nOn Keshan’s heights, he chants,\nLaughing, wields his brush, ink strokes writhing like serpents.\n\n**In Response to Poems Presented by Jiang Zhiguan**\n\nNew geese arrive, trailing a wisp of cloud,\nReading them, my hair stands on end, my scales bristle.\nUnfurling grand lines, a few strokes of ink,\nI envision the master’s face, all smiles.\nOn the couch, guests and friends speak of noble virtue,\nIn the mountains, the capped and gowned mingle with the mundane.\nTomorrow, I’ll wash my hands, tend the incense burner,\nFearing you may be an acquaintance from Penglai.\n\n**In Praise of the Bell**\n\nI hear the numinous palace is to cast a bell,\nThe August Emperor bestows ten thousand catties of bronze.\nA single mold’s release—no trifling matter,\nFor a thousand ages, know the alchemy’s craft.\nStruck, stars scatter, the moon falls,\nRung, clouds part, the wind howls.\nNow, to extend our sovereign’s years,\nI point and laugh at the jade towers clinging to the azure sky.\n\n**Jingtong Abbey**\n\nBeyond Jingtong Abbey, clear clouds are locked,\nWalls gleam like flying jasper, tiles layered like scales.\nWild birds, unconcerned, cry at dawn,\nCliff blossoms, intentional, bloom through the four seasons.\nCarved from wind and moon, a land of immortality,\nSeizing mist and rosy clouds, a body that never ages.\nSince Master Xu Jing departed as an immortal,\nI wonder to whom he entrusted the elixir’s secret.\n\n**Dan’an**\n\nAll my life, I sought only joy in purity and emptiness,\nClaiming the quietest dwelling in the human world.\nAn ancient wall bears a three-foot sword,\nA secluded window holds a bed of books.\nDistant mountains brighten as the sun rises,\nWithered trees chill as the wind combs them.\nSavoring the subtle flavor of leisure,\nI gather clouds and mist for sustenance.\n\n**The Rockery**\n\nWhen were these groves of bamboo planted?\nStrange stones and patterned bricks cradle green moss.\nFeathered guests wander the crags, arriving with the rain,\nImmortal elders pluck herbs, parting the clouds.\nMount Tiantai still arches like brows,\nMa Dang remains open like eyes.\nLast night, pearl-gatherers reported\nThe isle of Penglai lost beyond the sea.\n\n**Prayer for Rain Answered by Marshal Zhou**\n\nDrought demons scheme, demanding the *yu* rite,\nWhen will the true man bring rain?\nFirst, present the phoenix memorial to the golden palace,\nThen cast the iron talisman into the dragon pool.\nWith a flick of the finger, thunder roars in three peals,\nLifting my gaze, clouds rise in an instant.\nLaughing, I adjust the Dipper’s handle,\nTipping the Silver River to spill ten thousand bushels of pearls.\n\n**Parting Lines for Master Geng and Hermit Wu**",

fleeting moment of clasped arms,\nleaving me unable to forget.\n\nStirred within, I compose *Ode to Yearning for Immortals*,\nto express my humble admiration and sincerity.\nOn the twenty-seventh day of the seventh month, the eighth year of Jiading.\n\nI yearn for immortals—my divine companions,\ntheir rosy robes swaying—where do they dwell?\nTo see a crane’s long cry would yet suffice,\nfor Penglai lies but half a step away.\n\nYet only their calligraphy lingers among men,\neach line of characters like autumn geese in formation.\nTheir words of sincerity and integrity were wondrous,\nwho could fathom such formless intimacy?\n\n*Ode to Seeing Cranes*\n\nAt midday in the Three Flowers Abbey,\nsuddenly twelve cranes—black-robed, white-gowned—\nsoared, cried, and danced above.\nThus I composed *Ode to Seeing Cranes*,\npresented to Ni Meichuang and Vice-Palace Lu.\nOn the twenty-third day of the seventh month.\n\nImmortal paintings on paper hang on ancient walls,\nday and night veiled in smoke.\nClay-molded Zhongli, wooden-carved Lü,\nare not the Primordial Sovereign of the Great Dao.\n\nIn this dusty world, no elixir formulas remain,\nthe mute Daoists all refuse to speak.\nThe Scattered Man of Wuyi does not shame the immortals,\nhe seeks only three bowls of snow each day.\n\nWhite cranes, white cranes—whence do you come?\nWhen will the cinnabar steps and crimson gates open?\nDo not cry out in vain in the empty sky—\nhow swift the cold wind and drifting clouds!\n\nWhen the cranes call, I have no ears;\nwhen they spread their wings, I have no eyes.\nPenglai is but half a step away,\nyet I spend my life as an old porter.\n\n*Inscribed on the Wall of Yulong Abbey*\n\nMaster Jingyang departed in the great peace of the Kang era,\nthe stone turtle’s ashes cold before the ancient cave.\nLaughing, he slew the white dragon on the smartweed shore,\ndrunk, he rode the yellow crane through the clouds.\n\nThe golden elixir and jade fragments are no more,\nyet the iron sun and stone casket remain.\nWhere now are his forty-two household members?\nOnly the apes’ cries on Western Mountain, the smoke of cypress trees.\n\n*Ni Zhaoqing’s Rhapsody Presented to the Divine Lad Ye*\n\nThe divine lad Ye abandoned Confucianism to follow Master Red Pine,\nhis Dao lofty, his virtue pure—\nhis form like earth and wood,\nhis spirit towering and unadorned,\ntruly one among immortals.\n\nBy chance, he returned after praying for rain,\nand I deeply regretted not keeping pace,\napologizing for my inadequate companionship in his refined discourse.\nI craft these verses to convey my longing,\nhoping earnestly for his instruction.\n\nThe divine lad’s appearance is pure and wondrous,\nhis Dao transmits the teachings of the Recluse.\nAfter three years in the chamber, his elixir is ripe,\nhis skin radiant, supple, glowing.\n\nHe ties silk to cover himself, content in abundance,\nthe gleaming purple mushrooms can sate his hunger.\nHe leaps into the gourd—none see him—\nmorning he roams the Five Peaks, evening the Jasper Pool.\n\nAt times he mingles in the world of dust,\nhis short hair in a topknot, his beard flowing.\nIn an instant, dragons and snakes spring from his brush,\nhis inspiration poured into new poems.\n\nI suspect he delights in the tranquility of mountains and waters,\nreturning to his old retreat, hanging his cap low.\nI wish to ride the floating clouds to the azure vault,\nto ascend the crimson gates and follow him forever.\n\n*Again*\n\nHow divinely gifted is the divine lad—so wise!\nWith ten scrolls in a single breath, his fame grows.\nWere he not Li Taibai of the Tang,\nJingtong the Perfected would be reborn.\n\nHis words strike like thunder from stone, startling all present,\nhis treasured scrolls soothe the multitudes.\nThe Eight Trigrams and Five Phases serve his art,\nthe golden elixir and great medicine form naturally.\n\nHis coarse sleeves outshine embroidered silks,\nhis silver hooks astonish ghosts and gods.\nThe immortal mountains are fit to retain his jade pendants—\nwhy must he walk atop Penglai’s peak?\n\n*Song of Longing for the Divine Lad*\n\nHis noble spirit soars, untethered—\nwho could restrain him?\nHis fragrant verses, like trailing vines—who plucks their wonders?\nI alone, entranced, am lost in rapture,\nregretting I cannot swiftly behold his purple-mushroom brows.\n\nI gaze for the beauty at the edge of the sky,\nface unknown, yet heart acquainted.\nThe blue ox does not cross—how I envy Hua’s bridle,\nthe golden waves still—his pure wine forgotten.\n\nHis lines stand tall, radiant as a rainbow’s molt,\nthe Dipper and Northern Stars dare not shine.\nThe black apes howl at the trees, the fine steeds draw back,\nthe frost-feathered magpies fold their wings—ghosts and gods grieve.\n\nThe celestial pipes sound—not by human breath—\nhow could they mingle with frogs and worms in the filth?\nWhen may we clasp hands and discourse on the mysterious?\nThe peaches of immortality are not yet ripe, their fragrance elusive.\n\nGolden tablets and jade scripts lie scattered,\ngreen clouds lock the branches of the soaring forest.\nExiled to the dusty world, he departs the jade steps—\nthe mundane dust and vulgar vapors are not his place.\n\nWorldly ties remain unfinished, like boiling gruel,\nvainly he startles the maidens and infants.\nWhen will the jade melodies of the azure heavens take flight?\nThe green phoenix long promised a feast at the Jasper Pool.\n\nOne day, riding deer, we shall follow,\nbefore the Jade Bamboo Mountain, together we’ll gather mushrooms.\n\n*Postscript*\n\nAlas, how many years have I yearned for the Dao,\nscouring all elixir texts to learn immortality.\nLead and mercury blend without method,\nseeking golden connections lacks karmic affinity.\n\nI toil over *The Transmission of the Dao*,\nyet bathing fails to enlighten me to *The Awakening to Reality*.\nThe jade formulas have never been annotated—\ndo not waste effort poring over paper relics.\n\nA half-word lightly received from a perfected one’s teaching\ndemands a single backward glance at rivers and mountains.\nDiligence in practice follows yin and yang,\nreversing and cycling, distinguishing before and after.\n\nThe Yellow Dame’s matchmaking—how could it depend on the spleen?\nThe golden essence soars—not confined to the elbow.\nIf one can seize the true essence of heaven and earth,\nonly then may one endure as long as heaven and earth.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Zhao Ruqu, Cultivator of Emerald Clouds,\nActing Magistrate of Chong’an County, Jianning Prefecture,\nafter burning incense and bowing his head.\n\n*Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection: Wuyi Collection, Scroll Fifty-Two* (End)",
