  "full_translation": "**Precious Gems from the Dharma Ocean**\n\n*Scripture Title:* Precious Gems from the Dharma Ocean. Author unknown. Likely compiled between the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties. Forty-six scrolls in total. Base text sourced from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Peace Section.\n\n---\n\n**Precious Gems from the Dharma Ocean, Scroll 1, Part 1**\n**The Divine Empyrean Scripture of the Ten Celestial Characters**\n\n### **Arcane Refinement in Hidden Practice**\nFor those who wish to receive and uphold the *Scripture of the Ten Celestial Characters* and engage in the work of arcane refinement, perform the following at the four cardinal hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*: face the *xun* direction, sit cross-legged, knock the teeth to gather the spirit, and recite the sacred title nine times. Envision the Divine Empyrean drawing in a breath of azure *qi*, press the tongue against the upper palate, and inscribe the scripture. Hold the jade-green essence within the mouth, swallow it into the heart, and circulate it without dissipation. After a long while, it will surge upward, piercing the *Niwan* (Mud Pill Palace), and emerge as a sphere of *qi*. Continuously recite the sacred title until suddenly, with a thunderous crack, a spark of fire bursts forth from the sphere, merging with the radiance of the azure *qi*. At that moment, perform the rites of reverence and invocation. The spark of fire will instantly transform into celestial fire and azure light, descending straight from the *Niwan* through the *Chonglou* (Double Storied Tower) to the *Dantian* (Cinnabar Field), where it takes seat within the *Danyuan* (Elixir Origin). The deities of the Three Passes and Eight Scenic Realms will all come to pay homage, chanting the celestial scripture in unison. In an instant, all sounds vanish into silence. Practicing this morning and evening for nine years will dissolve the corpse’s toxins, refine both form and spirit to perfection, and unite one with the True Dao.\n\n### **Secret Applications of Inscribing the Scripture**\nFor the talismanic script of the *Celestial Scripture*, burn incense, sit in stillness, and recite the *Scripture of the Ten Celestial Characters* without counting the repetitions. Inscribe these ten characters as a talisman, either in sequence or layered. Upon completion, summon *Zhang Shu*, the Swift Commanding Numinous Flying Divine Talisman Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Primordial Realm. Envision the talisman envoy as a Heavenly Soldier (*Tianding*) wearing a crown, with a blue-green face, golden armor, black robes, green boots, and a wind-swept sash, wielding a jade axe. He descends from the *xun* gate, merging with the ancestral *qi*. Silently pray with utmost sincerity for your intended purpose—whether for supplication, exorcism, ingestion, display, wearing, or consecration. Employ it as you wish, and it will respond without fail.\n\n### **The Scripture of the Ten Celestial Characters**\n*Summoning the Talisman Envoy Talisman*\n\nThe humble servant [Name] respectfully summons—\nHaving recited the Celestial Scripture above and inscribed the talisman, envision golden light entering the talisman. When invoking it for service, there is nothing it cannot penetrate.\n\n**The Jade Pivot Scripture, Fifteen Talismans**\nFor each of the fifteen talismans, one must purify the heart, sit in silence, clench the fists, concentrate the spirit, and recite the Heavenly Worthy’s sagely name without counting the repetitions. Envision the Heavenly Worthy descending from the *xun* gate, and with utmost reverence, silently pray for your purpose. Visualize golden light entering the talisman, then recite the corresponding prayer for your request.\n\n*Black of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Primordial, the True Form is revered Fire.\nThe thunder’s roar opens the primordial kalpa, the lightning’s flash illuminates the hidden depths.\nDivine transformations manifest in wondrous ways, sagely virtue crowns all numinous beings.\nHow marvelous are these ten characters—worth more than reciting ten thousand scrolls of scripture.*\n\n**Chapter One:** Cultivating the Dao to seek transcendence.\n**Chapter Two:** Summoning the Nine Numinous and Three

Refinement**\n\nWhen all is settled and stabilized, self and other are forgotten. Visualize the Primordial Beginning expounding the Thunder Chapter within the Golden Portal, each character radiant with golden light. Then, envision each character filling the vastness of the Great Void, all transforming into golden script, shimmering with luminous brilliance. Next, recite the Thunder Chapter, and Marshal Xin will instantly manifest.\n\n**Uniting Qi and Refining Spirit**\nCompose the spirit and sit in stillness, where heaven and earth dissolve into emptiness. Press the tongue against the upper palate, wait until the Flower Pool’s waters fill, then swallow them into the heart—do this three times. Next, visualize within the black clouds of the northwest a deity resembling a Persian. Draw in *qi* through the nose into the heart, from the heart descend to the kidneys, then from the kidneys return to the heart—repeat this three times, and it is sufficient. Envision this *qi* entering the Cinnabar Field, which is the center of the navel. When fully coalesced into form, it becomes distinctly manifest within one’s Cinnabar Field. Then exhale with a *he* breath, releasing it from the altar to employ as desired. For regular seated refinement, settle into stillness for a time, where self and objects are forgotten, and *qi* circulates within the compass of the One.\n\n**Oath Chapter**\nHeaven unites with my true self, Earth unites with my true self,\nSun and Moon unite with my true self, the Twenty-Eight Constellations unite with my true self.\nMy spirit enters the master’s spirit, the master’s spirit enters my spirit.\nCirculating throughout the Three Realms, I act on the master’s behalf to deliver the myriad spirits.\nUpon completion of the merit, I ascend to the Jade Register, awaiting the master’s return to the Purple Court.\n*As the Primordial Decree commands.*\n\nOnce the incantation is complete, make any prayer as desired. After the prayer, bow once to Lord Xin, merging into one body. Sit upright in perfect stillness, where my body is Lord Xin, and Lord Xin is my body—thus summoning the Thunder Spirits. For refinement practices, enter the Central Palace. Both internal and external practices require eighty-one days each. Cultivate and nourish for three cycles of nine, and thereafter, great responses will be attained in all undertakings.\n\n**Nine Yangs Internal Refinement Thunder Chapter**\nSweep away all worldly concerns, sit in stillness for a long while, then gather and concentrate the Five Agents. When the Five Agents harmonize, spirit, essence, *hun*, and *po* all converge in the Central Palace. Golden light blazes forth, and within it stands Lord Xin. Still the heart and spirit further, descending into the Yellow Chamber, where Lord Liu appears. Next, silently recite the four characters *Nine Woods, Surplus Jade* nine times. Circulate them upward to the Mud Pill Palace, where the practitioner stands between heaven and earth. Then recite the Oath Thunder Chapter:\n\nBefore heaven and earth divided, before yin and yang were distinguished,\nI existed in this moment, without head or face.\nSince I have become myself, the Five Agents are all complete.\nYou, at this moment, are my spirit.\nI am united with you, and you are born from me.\nI now command you: be like me, be like me.\n\nThen silently recite the following incantation: *Cǔn Dì Bù Lín*, eighty-one times, ascending together with me to pay homage in the Jade Clarity. You are the essence of heaven, I am the spirit of earth. Take your essence to assist my spirit. I strike the celestial drum, sounding the Dharma drum thirty-six times, causing the seas and rivers to overturn. From now on, you and I shall be as brothers forever. I dispatch you to heaven to present memorials to the Imperial Lord. I dispatch you to earth to reach the deepest springs. I dispatch you into water to pervade the dark and frigid depths. I dispatch you to relieve great droughts, where true *qi* commands thunder and lightning. I dispatch you to capture specters and demons, binding them to reveal their forms. Universally deliver the world’s suffering, and together we shall establish merit. On the day when merit is complete and the Way fulfilled, I shall ascend with you in flight.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Three Qi Heavenly Lords, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Highest Lord of the Mysterious Heavens decree and command.*\n\nNext, sit in stillness and visualize a mass of golden light containing seed-characters, eternally guarding the Yellow Court. In all twelve hours, whether moving, staying, sitting, or lying down, silently maintain this protection. Even amidst worldly affairs and duties, one must remain vigilant. When engaging in practice, bow to the Great Void, and the spirit will follow the intent to emerge.\n\n*End of the First Scroll of* **Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls**\n\n---\n*(Note: The concluding bibliographic and contextual notes were not translated, as they fall outside the primary text and the requested output format.)*\n\n**#4 *Arcane Essentials of the Cavernous Mystery***: A secret transmission of the Divine Empyrean (Shenxiao) lineage and the Southern School of Golden Elixir (Jindan) from the Song and Yuan dynasties.

Within the Pass’s Gallbladder Palace, the True Sovereign of Thunder’s Divine Empyrean appears. Report the matter and await the granted memorial; the generals are dispatched in full.\n\nSend the Lunar General to present himself before the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, to retrieve the spirits under his charge and report: on such-and-such a day and hour of the current month, the rain shall be executed—ensure the response is distinct.\n\nWhen inscribing talismans and sitting in stillness, observe the altar’s conditions closely, and guard it vigilantly. Only when the dragon-general has reported may you ascend the altar. Proceed with confidence to command the rain.\n\n*Fu-Yuan* Talisman for Summoning Thunder:\nInscribed on yellow paper in cinnabar, with jade-script and fire-brush.\nThe Lords of the Three *Qi* of Yuanshi;\nThe Jade Emperor of the Golden Watchtower;\nThe Purple Tenuity Lord of the North Culmen.\nBy decree, summon the Three-Five Generals to descend swiftly.\nThe Three Divine Kings—Liu, Lü, and Zhang—hasten to this minister’s aid, bearing the talisman to execute the command.\n\nThree-Five Shaoyang Thunder: one talisman to the master, one talisman into the memorial text. Use two talismans for daily rotation; if unresponsive, use the urgent memorial talisman. If still ineffective, the refinement has failed, and the pledge may also be inscribed on incense and burned in the censer.\n\nEight Trigrams, Six Poles:\n*Kan*, *Li*.\n\nWithin the Mysterious:\nFirst, Xing; second, Deng; third, Liu—[for] rain. Six revolutions of the Primordial Right, drawing *qi* from the Kidney Mystery and blowing it in. [For] clear skies, five revolutions, drawing *qi* from the Heart and exhaling it in, applying it within the thunder. *Xia Xuan*: Two, two—Yin-Yang Dipper application seals the cover.\n\nSummon the Five Divine Lords of the Jade Treasury:\nLiu, Yu, Ren, Lü, and Zhang—the Five Divine Masters—hasten to this minister’s aid, bearing the talisman to heed the summons.\n\n*Tian-Yuan* Talisman for Summoning Thunder:\nInscribed on yellow paper in cinnabar, with nine revolutions of application. The Lords of the Three *Qi* of Yuanshi; the Jade Emperor of the Golden Watchtower; the Vermilion Numinosity Lord of the Southern Culmen. By decree, summon the Nine Yang Elders to descend swiftly. The Origin of Myriad Methods—Liu, Ning, and Ren—the Three Divine Kings—bear the talisman to hasten here. This minister receives the talisman to heed the summons.\n\nRefining and uniting the Inner Mystery:\nWind and thunder shake the earthly gates. Mysterious *qi* converges at *Li* and *Wu*. The master gathers spirit in profound stillness, closes the eyes, draws in the divine radiance, and inwardly gazes upon the Mysterious Palace. To the left and right, the two kidneys—*qi* splits open, ascending to the Crimson Palace, reaching the Divine Treasury to envelop the red and black *qi*. They intertwine within the heart, merging with the spirit-*qi*, where water and fire unite—this is called \"taking the general.\" The center of *Kan* is filled, transforming the Yin within *Li*’s chamber.\n\nAscending to the Flourishing Valley Palace, dragon and tiger form a sphere. The left liver, blue *qi* harboring the *hun*—this is the dragon. The right lung, white *qi* harboring the *po*—this is the tiger. Spirit and mysterious *qi* blend and merge. Within the heart’s chamber, a purple-golden sphere coalesces. With spirit and mysterious *qi* intermingling, blue, white, red, and black gather in the central chamber. By intent, the four *qi* fuse into a golden luminous sphere. Intent belongs to earth, yellow in hue—this is the meaning of essence, spirit, *hun*, *po*, and intent transforming into purple-golden frost.\n\nVisualize the purple-golden sphere descending to the Cinnabar Field, then entering the Tailbone Gate. From the spine’s passage, it ascends to the Muddy Pellet, flowing back down through the Twelve-Storied Tower to the Central Palace. Using the ancestral *qi*, guide it upward to surge through the Muddy Pellet, bursting forth from the crown’s gate. The golden sphere splits open, filling heaven and earth. Within, the infant gradually grows, appearing as a Daoist in yellow robes—this is the True Person of Primordial Destiny. The eyes flash open, gazing upward; the tongue presses against the upper palate, connecting directly to the void. Within, the Southern Dipper stands, its *Xun* gate open.\n\nBehold the master standing within the mouth of the Southern Dipper, clad in black robes, hair unbound, barefoot, grasping a sword. Within the Dipper’s mouth, he stands resolute beneath the sword’s point. Observe the radiant hair-like light above the crown’s gate, where the Mother of Myriad Spirits resides, barefoot, her eyes glancing downward at two intersecting beams of fire. To the left, Marshals Deng and Liu; to the right, Marshals Zhang, Ning, and Ren.\n\nWith a single movement of divine radiance, ten thousand billion thunder spirits array themselves in orderly ranks, each distinct and clear. Visualize your Primordial Destiny True Person approaching the master’s heart and bowing three times to present your petition. The disciple prays:\n\n*\"By long-standing affinity, I have been fortunate to inherit this teaching. Humbly, I beseech your compassion, Master, to grant my request. May you bestow your decree, commanding the Three Great Marshals—Liu, Ning, and Ren—to aid and uphold my practice. I, so-and-so, dare not offend your solemn authority; my heart is filled with boundless gratitude, awaiting your command.\"*\n\nIf praying for rain or petitioning for some matter, visualize the master granting your plea.\n\nConclude with the heart’s incantation:\n\n*\"Heaven unites with my truth,\nEarth unites with my truth,\nSun and moon unite with my truth.\nThe Three Terraces crown my head,\nThe Twenty-Eight Constellations unite with my truth.\nMy spirit enters the master’s spirit,\nThe master’s spirit enters my spirit.\nI traverse the Three Realms,\nActing on the master’s behalf to save the myriad spirits.\nWhen the work is done, I ascend the Jade Register,\nAttending the master to return to the Purple Court.\nHūng śrī tī tā ā chāo mó suō shā.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, or when the heart’s petition is complete, restore your spirit.\n\nIf summoning the thunder spirits, proceed here with the recitation:\n\n**Thunder Rites Chapter**\nChaos without form, the One *qi* gives birth.\nHeaven and earth unfold, thunder and lightning move.\nTā yō Great Brahmā, hūng jì lǜ hēng.\nYin and yang intersect, sun and moon hasten in reverence.\nJū nú shí nà, zhì hè jū zhēn.\nBreathing forth hūng chà, jī bō xiáng jīng.\nEncompassing harmony, wind and fire surge hūng.\nZhōng yìng shù lǎng, wú liàng lǎng hūng.\nAbove harmonizes with below, mountains, seas, and rivers are at peace.\nTrue crow is solemn, true decree commands homage.\nRecite once, and thunder and lightning descend.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Edict of the Lord of Thunder from the Cavernous Mystery commands!*\n\nThe above is the method for gathering and stationing clouds, the secret for summoning thunder and rain.\n\n**Further Internal Refinement**\nRefine this for eighty-one days, nine cycles of nine. When the work is pure and ripe, the response will be as swift as an echo.\n\nSit upright and composed, settle the mind and concentrate the spirit. After a long while, regulate the breath—eighty-one cycles. One inhalation and one exhalation count as one breath. Gaze downward at the spirit palace, where yang *qi* gradually flourishes. Keep intent fixed on the spirit palace. When eighty-one breaths are complete, Marshal Liu’s true form will be fully realized.\n\nSilently recite and visualize the three syllables *Jiū pán chà* nine times. Envision nine beams of cinnabar light from these syllables converging in the spirit palace to form Marshal Liu’s true form, who then pays homage to the Imperial Master.\n\nVisualize the Yellow Court transformed into the Jade Capital of the Divine Empyrean, where the Jade Pivot Emperor sits cross-legged, grasping a sword, encircled by swirling azure light, with thunder spirits arrayed to his left and right.\n\nGaze again at the spirit palace. Silently recite the *Chaos Without Form* thunder chapter and the oath chapter. Then, with the two-character summoning incantation □□, recite it in the heart’s voice, look upward toward the *Li* direction, assume a wrathful expression, and open the eyes wide in anger. See the Marshal emerge from the left eye upon a cloud of fire, standing between heaven and earth before you. If summoning rain in clear weather, have him ride a black cloud emerging from the right eye.\n\nVisualize the Heavenly Lord soaring through the empyrean, stirring wind and clouds, as thunder and rain erupt in full force. At this point, clearly summon the Heavenly Lord to the altar, state your intent, and dispatch him.\n\nThen, gaze downward at the Yellow Court and silently recite the *Strategy for Commanding Thunder* chapter—*Chaos Without Form*—once. Each character appears in golden hue.\n\nAgain, glare fiercely, eyes wide, and shoot forth two beams of golden light from both eyes. Envision the Marshal riding the golden light away, wielding wind and fire, commanding the *qi* of the *Gang* wind to rise. At *Hai*, fire ignites; at *Mao*, thunder roars, and the decree is executed.\n\nFor major matters, recite the two-character incantation □□ eighty-one times; for lesser matters, thirty-six, fifteen, or nine times. Then, draw a long breath through the nose, glare fiercely, and let the spirit follow intent outward. Ascend into the empyrean, where the Heavenly Lord’s true form is distinct.\n\nThe preceding method of regular visualization and refinement is called *refining the spirit*. Directing the spirit upward from the Central Palace to the two eyes, so that the spirit follows the gaze outward, is called *exiting the spirit*. When dispatching for practical use, the spirit’s light from the eyes shoots forth, aiding the Heavenly Generals in conveying authority—this is called *dispatching the spirit*. When Marshal Liu is seen, draw him in through the nose, returning from the Muddy Pellet Palace to the original palace—this is called *returning the spirit*. One downward and one upward movement constitute the wondrous function of exit and entry.\n\nThe master says: *\"When the spirit is settled and *qi* ascends, light emerges and the spirit manifests.\"*\n\nRecite the incantation:\n\n**Returning the Spirit Incantation**\n*\"Spirit returns to the spirit palace,\n*Qi* returns to the cinnabar origin.\nWhen summoned again, return as before,\nAll as in the original rite.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, visualize Marshal Liu, the Heavenly Lord, treading a wheel of fire, wielding a golden whip, descending from the Muddy Pellet Palace. Draw him in and return him to the spirit palace, inviting the spirit’s return.\n\n*Guard this well, guard this well.*\n*Sealed in accord with the* Cavernous Mystery Purple Empyrean Family Script.\n\nDescendant So-and-so bows a hundred times to seal the covenant.\n\nFor the right [document], use yellow paper, two *cun* in width and three and a half *cun* in length. Write the *chen*-hour script, drawing the purple *qi* to form the talisman. Visualize Marshal Ma, the Perfected Lord, with a face like a red jujube, large eyes and ears, golden earrings, wearing a seven-black Daoist crown, purple robe, and black shoes, holding a thunder ruler, standing in the spirit palace. Then, with a single brushstroke, let one *qi* complete the talisman.\n\nThe family script is to be conveyed by the Perfected Lord to the presence of the True Man Bai.\n\n**Thunder Chamber Master’s Family Script Covenant Talisman**\nFor the right talisman, use yellow paper, two *cun* in width and three and a half *cun* in length. Write in vermilion, using the *yin*-hour script, and infuse the talisman with the fire *qi*. Affix it to the square case and reverently present it from superior to inferior.\n\nFor urgent matters, use black paper and write to the master’s office to report the emergency.\n\nWhenever writing talismans, first visualize the True Man with a youthful face, topknot, yellow Daoist robe, bare feet, holding a thunder ruler, and convey the message through the Elder True Man to Marshal Ma’s presence.\n\n**Marvelous Transmission of the Bloodline**\nThe master says: *\"Within this lies a thousand-gold secret never to be transmitted. Should it be leaked, calamity will befall the self and extend to the nine generations. Most secret, most secret—most wondrous, most wondrous!\"*\n\n**Incense of Faith Talisman**\nSummoning the thunder gods at the altar.\n\nAt the appointed hour, perform the rain-summoning tally.\n*\"[Name] commands the thunder to deploy and spread *qi*—\nWith thunderclaps and lightning, merge with the True *Qi*,\nAs if the Emperor himself were acting.\nYour servant [Name] presents the talisman in reverent report.\"*\n\nThis talisman is to be inscribed on yellow paper, one *cun* and three *fen* in width, nine *cun* in length. Roll the talisman horizontally, bind it with thread, and burn it in the incense censer.\n\n*End of Scroll Two of* **Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls**\n\n**#1 Vermilion Yang Fire Phoenix Chapter:**\nThis chapter, along with the *Azure Numinosity United Faith Chapter*, *Vermilion Yang Summons and Advances Chapter*, *Azure Numinosity Jade Slips Chapter*, *Vermilion Yang Brocade Slips Chapter*, *Azure Numinosity Great Brahma Chapter*, *Vermilion Yang Golden Brahma Chapter*, *Azure Numinosity Jade Throne Chapter*, and *Vermilion Yang Jade Throne Chapter*, is also recorded in *Dharma Convergence* (Scroll 148 of *The Wondrous Cavern Numinous Treasure Jade Pivot Thunder Rites*), where they are collectively titled *The Nine Golden and Jade Chapters of the Wondrous Cavern Numinous Treasure*.

Thus may the **True Wind** flow and spread, the **Daoist arts** flourish, and great rewards be bestowed in luminous reciprocity. **Execute with utmost urgency.**\n\n**Respectfully compiled.**\n\nOn the day of the **Great Year**, in the *__* month, *__* day, at the *__* hour, this document is compiled.\n\nThe humble official, Minister *__(Surname)*, by imperial decree, hereby executes the rites.\n\n**Ancestral Master, Central Heaven’s Pivot, Demon-Quelling True Lord Xu**, resides in the heavens.\n\n**Seals and Talismans Within This Document**\n**Thunder Talisman**\n**Command Talisman**\n**Command Incantation**\nHeavenly Thunder Water Masters, Earthly Thunder Fire Masters, Sacred Controllers of the Three Realms—hear the command and descend at once.

The hidden essence acts as my courier—I uphold the Jade Decree of the Primal Chaos.\n\nFor all ritual matters, one must begin at the fourth quarter of the *yin* hour. Enter the chamber, gaze inward with the eyes, and exhale three breaths of impure *qi*. Then, draw in the primordial azure *qi* of the Origin through the nose, press the tongue to the upper palate, and stir the divine water of the *Huachi*. Guide the azure *qi* downward into the *Dantian*.\n\nNext, visualize entering the single point between the two kidneys. Close the eyes and imagine the left eye as the sun, the right as the moon. The *yin* and *yang* *qi* unite and descend into the azure *qi* of the *Dantian*. Abide in stillness, allowing the *qi* to rise naturally to the heart, then return to the kidneys.\n\nAfter a moment, the two *qi* converge in the *Huangting*, coalescing into a golden orb of light, akin to a fire-forged cinnabar elixir. The body is no longer one’s own—only the five *qi* emerge from the five viscera, encircling this golden orb of light. It ascends along the spine to the *Niwan*. Suddenly, the golden light parts, revealing a true person, identical to one’s original form, merging into oneness with the self.\n\nAfter a moment, visualize the true person emitting a *qi* from the *Niwan*, which divides into the Three Clarities, the Eight Realms, the myriad celestial emperors, and the marshals and clerics of this method. Then, make your petition as desired.\n\nWhen finished, abide in stillness once more, beholding only the golden orb of light. Draw it back into the *Huangting*. Profound and wondrous—guard this secret.\n\n*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Five—End.*\n\n**#1 Epistolary Style:**\n*The Secret Essentials of the Fire Palace of the Great One* is also collected in *Daoist Methods Compendium*, Scroll 194, with minor textual variations.\n\n**#2 \"Joyful Tongue\" Talismanic Seal:**\nThis is also included in *Daoist Methods Compendium*, Scroll 192, under *Secret Methods for Invoking the Divine in the Inner Hall of the Fire Palace of the Great One*.

The talismanic form shares broad similarities with minor variations, though the accompanying text is far more extensive.\n\n---\n\n**Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Six**\n**Inner Essentials of the Three Palaces**\n\n**#1 Fire Master** states:\nWhen summoning rain like strands of rope, there must be thunder and lightning. If there is no wind, invoke the Wind Earl Divine Lord. Should the Wind Earl fail to arrive, flooding may ensue—hasten to return to the altar and offer thanks for the rain. Inscribe two \"Returning Phoenix\" talismans, burn them with peach wood and fragrant fire, and offer ten portions each of gold spirit-money and celestial steeds, burning them according to the five directions at the appropriate location. Once the rain flows freely, proceed without delay; do not linger.\n\nFirst, at the place of governance and tranquility, enter the chamber, settle the mind, and stabilize the spirit. Gather the myriad thunder *qi* and return them to their origin before departing elsewhere. Let none know of this.\n\n**Secret Methods for Wind, Thunder, Rain, Clear Skies, and Clouds:**\n- **Sound *yāo*:** Store the ancestral *qi* in the lungs.\n- **Exhale from the Celestial Eye (sound *hōng*):** Store the ancestral *qi* in the liver; gallbladder *qi* issues from the Celestial Eye.\n- **Sound *huī*:** Ancestral *qi*.\n- **Kidney Palace arises (sound *xū*):** Ancestral *qi*.\n- **Heart Palace arises (sound *xī*):** Ancestral *qi*.\n- **Kidney Palace arises:** Employ the preceding secrets as needed to summon wind, thunder, rain, clear skies, or clouds. Inscribe within a circle and silently circulate the divine mechanism—efficacy lies in utmost sincerity.\n\n**The Jade Emperor’s Personal Thunder Mechanism:**\nFace the appropriate direction, set up an incense table, and the summoned deities will arrive instantly.\n\n**Directions for Stepping the Dipper and Flying the Incantation:**\n1. *Wù* (5th Earthly Branch)\n2. *Sì* (6th)\n3. *Wǔ* (7th)\n4. *Wèi* (8th)\n5. *Yín* (3rd)\n6. *Mǎo* (4th)\n7. *Chén* (5th)\n8. *Hài* (12th)\n9. *Zǐ* (1st)\n10. *Chǒu* (2nd)\n11. *Shēn* (9th)\n12. *Yǒu* (10th)\n\nFace the designated direction, draw the Dipper’s *qi*, and blow toward it. To rouse thunder, burn the talisman in that direction to provoke its force.\n\n**Thunder Master’s Teachings:**\nBeyond the heart, there is no method; the method arises from the heart. When the heart is settled, *qi* gathers; when *qi* gathers, spirit gathers; when spirit gathers, the myriad spirits assemble, and golden light converges from all directions.\n\n**Sound *yā yā* □:**\nThese three *qi* are the ancestors of the ten thousand *qi* and the origin of the myriad spirits. Employ them to open the eight windows and activate the nine orifices. The spirits emerge from emptiness, disperse into form, and when concealed, return to the Six Harmonies, hidden within mountains and peaks.

Strike the thunder formation five times—perceive the thunder’s roar, ears resounding with its clamor, eyes flashing with lightning, nose exhaling black clouds, mouth issuing rain, and black winds rising behind the elbows.

*Spring* Volume Six, concludes.\n\n---\n**Nine Heavens Thunder-Crystal Envoy’s Sanskrit-Qi Hidden Script Mechanism**\n*Fahai Yizhu*, Volume Seven\n\n**Black Boar Crossing the River**\n\nFor all prayers, visualize the Heavenly Mechanism of the Southern Dipper—when a star rains, water-clouds arise; when it dims, fire-clouds arise. Clearly, the star is neither red nor white, but the color of azure glass.\n\nSummon the Envoy to arrive, read the memorial, and repeatedly instruct them. Visualize the Envoy leading ten thousand thunder deities, bearing the command ○ into the starlight, where all is silent and no sound remains.\n\nOn the following day, fulfill the appointed time for response, acting as before. The Envoy wields a great axe, leading the thunder deities to bear the command into the star and execute the task.\n\nThen recite the personal incantation, the general summons for the thunder deities, and the incantation for their service. See the Envoy leading the thunder deities, riding clouds and mounting dragons to the altar—black clouds darken the sky, thunder roars, and lightning flashes, all arising at once.\n\nThe Master says: *\"When the Dipper’s handle is overturned and the heavens darken, this is inner work.\"* For outer application, the talisman must align—if clouds and qi respond on the first night, then inner and outer efforts will manifest their effect by the next day.\n\n**Talisman Method for Stirring and Exciting**\n\nFor the stirring method, use swallow’s blood and mud from a swallow’s nest to grind ink and inscribe the Envoy’s talisman. Write the Four Celestial Quarters in cinnabar at the four corners. To rouse the Envoy: for rain, invoke the Fire Star; for clear skies, invoke the Water Star—this is the principle of yin-yang excitation and clash.\n\nAfter use, apply the Four Dipper [substances] to the mouths of the Four Celestial Quarters, circling seven times and inscribing into the Envoy’s talisman:\n\n*By the axe, split the Demon-Quelling Star—*\n**Seize and subdue!**\n\n**Zi-Wu Dipper:**\n*Heavenly King Kāśyapa’s Thunderbolt—*\n**Seize!**\n\n**Wu-Zi Dipper:**\n*Heaven-Shattering, Earth-Rending, Ink-Black—*\n**Seize!**\n\n**Xu-Chen Dipper:**\n*Most High’s Heaven-Splitting Thunderbolt—*\n**Seize!**\n\n**Chen-Xu Dipper:**\n*Eastern Well’s Flood—*\n\nThe Master said: In the steadfastness of steadfastness, one may discourse on the Eastern Well. In the stillness of stillness, one may expound upon the Yellow River.\n\nNow, within the human body, from below the mud-pill palace, at the convergence of the twelve meridians—this is the source of the twelve rivers. Three inches below the navel lies the lower cinnabar field. The spirit ascends to the mud-pill, while that which descends to moisten is none other than the waters of the Yellow River, meeting at the gallbladder palace of the Eastern Well. Extending to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, the exhalations *xu*, *he*, *xi*, *chui*, and *hu* constitute the five phases, engendering true qi.\n\nWithin the heart, the true fire circulates; within the kidneys, the true water circulates—both arise from the inner transformations of this body. The numinous terrace, vast and empty, embraces heaven and earth, such that all before one is but the transformation of this heart.\n\nWhen the great yang heart-fire descends and the kidney-water ascends, the fluids naturally flow and circulate, filling the mouth with sweet, fragrant nectar—this is the so-called sweet dew, the yellow blossom, the upper pool’s water, the flowing true fragrance of the flower pool’s transformations.\n\nTurn the Four Seas—let the Four Seas talismans follow their proper methods.\n\nWhen ascending the altar, place the Four Seas vats at the four corners of the platform to embody the Four Seas. Arrange the Four Images, completing the rites of offering and propriety, and cast the talismans into the vats to manifest the transformations of creation. Wield the Dragon-Whip to rouse its might, envisioning the four vats as the vastness of rivers, lakes, the Huai, and the sea—where fish and dragons gather, boundless and without shore. When the master employs the Dragon-Whip method to cast the talismans, in an instant the waters surge, heaven and earth darken, and thunderous rain pours forth. Outer phenomena and inner visions alike conform to this, for all arises from this single heart. Yet the adept must not cling to this form; rather, act in accordance with the method and the moment.\n\n**Boiling the Sea: Dragon-Summoning Talisman**\n*Oral formula for invocation, Heavenly Thunder Incantation*\nEnter the Five Designations:\n- Five Thunders\n- Four Seas\n- Three Marshals (or their envoys may also suffice)\n\nWith heart-fire, inscribe and summon the fire-qi to boil the waters, stirring the Three Marshals into motion. As moonlight surges and fire blazes, envision heaven and earth plunged into darkness. After wielding the Dragon-Whip and invoking the Five Designations, recite:\n\n**Right: Wooden Youth Incantation**\nTrace a pointed circle, its application transmitted orally. Envision waters surging and fire blazing, the Five Thunders and Three Marshals each riding dragons into the heavens and diving into the seas to bring forth rain.\n\n**Dragon-Whip Method**\n*(Text corrupted, five characters missing)*\n\nFor borrowing waters from deep pools, use an iron plaque inscribed with the Envoy Talisman in swallow’s blood mixed with realgar and cinnabar. Apply the Five Designations to the talisman and cast it into the pool or cavern—thunder and rain will respond immediately.\n\n**Summoning Thunder: Incantation for Striking the Thunder Bowl**\nInscribe the characters *Yi* (翼) and *Zhen* (轸), arranging the *qi* of *Gen* (艮) and *Xun* (巽) between them.\n\n*Incantation:*\nSummon the thunderclaps, let lightning intertwine and soar.\nMarshal of Sudden Fire, Five Great Thunder Deities,\nYin-Yang Thunder Chiefs, heed and obey.\nWith the divine brush, sudden fire; with the thunder hammer, swift arise.\nHasten the thunderclaps, act with fiery urgency.\n\n**Three Turns of the Big Dipper, Step by Step, Kicking Upward**\nRecite the preceding incantation, first striking the bowl. Rise from the left *Yi*, gaze toward the right *Zhen*. Overturn a basin to cover the ground, face east, and pace the Dipper’s steps from afar. Turn to the west, recite the incantation, and strike the bowl with the axe. Kick upward with the left foot—thunder will arrive at once.\n\nThe axe weighs sixteen *jin*, inscribed on a *jiazi* day with the Azure Dragon Incantation, one *chi* and two *cun* in length. It is forged on a *bingzi* day.\n\n*Incantation:*\n\nNine Heavens’ Edict Command,\nsternly harness the scaled steeds.\nSix Dragons and Nine Shameful Ones—\nthe thunder’s decree admits no kinship.\nBlood-sworn pacts replace oaths,\nvows offered to the spirits.\nSever venom, topple shrines,\nreveal the Dao and illumine the True.\nGrasp the halberd, wield the halberd,\ncleave the waters and sever the whale.\nAt times light as dust in the void,\nat times heavy as a thousand *jin* of iron;\nwhen white, white as snow in the heavens,\nwhen red, red as the blood of the gibbon.\n\nGreat Thunder, Second Thunder, Third Thunder,\nFourth Thunder, Fifth Thunder.\nAll as decreed by the Jade Purity True King’s statutes.\n*Ku* □ swiftly descend with lightning’s grasp.\n\nWith each clap, recite once.\nFor the right talisman, recite once per character written.\nOnce the talisman is complete, recite the *Edict Command Thunder Incantation* five times, then lift the brush with all force upward.\nEmploy the Five Thunders Mudra: from *Hai* to *Si*, infuse *qi* from *Gen* and *Xun*.\n\nThe master says: The Thunder-Sudden Fire Lord governs this method. Sudden Fire commands the Five Thunder Spirits to assist, while the messenger oversees them—essentially, the Three Marshals are one.\n\n**On the Mechanism of the Method**\nFor all prayers, offer incense at the altar’s five directions. Fierce fire stirs wrath to summon and dispatch the Thunder Spirit Messengers.\nWhether through wrathful *qi*, laughter, or alchemical refinement—\nwhether dousing the Eastern Well, churning the Four Seas,\nbeating drums to call thunder, galloping steeds to rouse dragons,\nigniting firecrackers to activate talismans, flipping incense to break commands,\nerecting altars near water, borrowing *qi* to gather clouds,\npetitioning dragons by boiling the sea, or harnessing wind to drive rain—\nall cause spirits to follow the turning of the mechanism.\n\nThe master says: Beating drums to call thunder or igniting firecrackers to activate talismans—these stir courage.\nErecting altars near water or borrowing *qi* to gather clouds—these leverage circumstance.\n\n**On Mutual Dependence**\nThe messenger cannot lack the Supreme Unity; the Supreme Unity cannot lack the messenger.\nIf they are the messenger, you are the Supreme Unity.\nIf they are dispatched by me, I am their master—thus, the messenger and I cannot be without each other.\nTo my left is Thunder, to my right is Lightning; opening summons, closing gathers. The messenger never departs from me.\nBecause they cannot be separated, mutual dependence exists.\n\n**Method for Summoning Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain**\nWith the gaze, inscribe the *Xu* character in the left palm. Rub both hands together until scorching hot, visualize a sphere of golden light in the palms, then sweep it before the face and inscribe the character in the void.\nImagine the golden radiance within the light. Form the Eight Trigrams with both hands, return to the *Zi* script’s configuration, assume a wrathful stance, and recite the eight characters: *Luo xian ye li zha bo hong su*.\nContinuously rub the hands without pause, drawing the Five Affairs to the altar, and recite the sixteen-character incantation while rubbing.\n\n**Method for Raising Wind**\nVisualize in the *Xun* direction’s black clouds a ghost with a green face, turban, and robe, a great general holding a tiger-skin wind bag, riding a blue-green dragon.\nNext, visualize the ancestral *qi* entering the liver in three coils, transforming into the □□ characters in golden hue.\nExhale the *Xu* and *Xi* breaths through the *Xun* gate, merging with the general’s cyan and red *qi*.\nFocus the gaze and recite: *Om chi zha ti dang zui she*.\nWithout ceasing, chant the *Xu* and *Xi* breaths in unison, visualize the red and cyan morning’s two signs, imagine the sleeves as wind bags, and wave them to draw forth an unbroken stream.\nAlso recite the sixteen-character incantation and command: *Xia ya shang Feng Yi, swiftly arise!*\nAfter the incantation, declare: *Great Thunder Wind General, swiftly descend!*\n\n**Gathering Clouds to Obscure the Sun**\nThe master says: Once external matters are complete, press the tongue to the upper palate, first inscribe the *Liao* character, and swallow it into the heart’s palace. Visualize the heart’s Dipper kicking to churn the kidney’s water.\nNext, use the heart’s fire to inscribe the sun’s sign in the Flower Pool, then the moon’s sign, as luminous as the sun.\nVisualize the kidney’s water surging like a tide, filling the Flower Pool to submerge the sun’s sign. With the Red Dragon, stir the water to overflow, submerging the moon’s sign.\nInhale the water from the previously used vessel, gather the working in the mouth, and spray it to instantly darken the sky.\nThis is the workings of creation, transmitted orally, never committed to paper or brush. Fearing its loss over time, it is recorded here.\n\nIf using a vat or jar, proceed then to summon the five elements of wind and clouds.\n\n**Summoning Clouds and Turning the Mechanism**\nThe master sits in silent meditation, circulating black clouds dense and dark from the Xun direction. Only then does he open his eyes, and clouds naturally arise.\nHe further circulates the deepest blackness from both kidneys, transforming it into a vast sea where wind and waves surge. With a single exhalation of lung *qi*, waves from both kidneys arise, descending to the depths of the great sea. There, he perceives a three-legged *neng*, its mouth spewing black clouds that ascend along the spine to the Heavenly Gate, billowing outward. He then employs the *Tuanmo* method.\n\n**The Concealing Sun Formula**\nThe master recites the Jade Emperor’s *Gao*, inscribing the sign ☩ with divine radiance, merging it with the creative workings of wind and clouds.\nUpon completing the Jade Emperor’s *Gao*, he again applies his own creative power: pressing the tongue to the upper palate, he inscribes this sign and exhales it into the water vessel.\nAfter reciting the incantation, he inhales the *qi* of the Celestial Stem, sprays it upon the sun and moon, and instantly darkens them.\nHe then employs the *qi* of destruction, reciting the *Concealing Three Lights* incantation:\n*Taiwei Tongzi, chi.*\n*Cheli, svāhā.*\n*Oṃ.*\n*Rāhu, Ketu, and the Earth Mansion seize.*\n*Oṃ.*\n*Ni ni hūm hūm.*\n*The black-dark sky subdues.*\nReciting this incantation without counting repetitions, he inscribes the preceding sign with his gaze, veiling the sun and moon. Reinforcing it with the spraying method, he waits until the sunlight dims slightly before applying the *Tuan Yun* method.\nOtherwise, the yin *qi* cannot approach the yang.\n\n**The Gathering Clouds Formula**\n*Fire, Empyrean Fire.*\n\n**Water Refinement with Water**\nFirst, heat the water vessel over fire until scorching hot. Using a black brush, inscribe the sign of the Sun Lord, then recite:\n*Oṃ.

Next, apply the *Great Gathering Clouds* talisman atop it, reciting the *Gathering Clouds* incantation while anointing it. Finally, perform the *Rubbing Palms* method.\n\n**Rubbing Palms Formula**\nThe master forms the *Sword Mudra*, inscribing the character *bi* (毕) on the left palm with the right hand, then circulates kidney-water *qi* and blows upon it. Next, inscribe the character *jiao* (角) on the right palm with the left hand, drawing heart-fire *qi* and exhaling upon it. Then, rub both palms together until they grow as hot as fire, thrust them into the water vessel, inhale the water, and spray it toward the sun while shouting commands to proceed. If no response occurs, employ the *Grasping Wind and Thunder* incantation.\n\n**Rubbing Palms Incantation**\n*Ni ni hūm hūm, Black-Dark Great Spirit.*\n*Heaven spins, earth turns, sun and moon lose their light.*\n*Rāhu and the Earth Mansion, destructive *qi* soars.*\n*Heaven and earth darken, east and west indistinguishable.*\n*The Three Realms merge into chaos, misty *qi* instantly rises.*\n*Thunder cracks the earth, wind and fire rush forth.*\n*Oṃ.

Visualize the talisman’s messenger, then beneath the feet, within the Thunder character, repeatedly inscribe the nine characters: *fēn, gài, dū, gǔ, líng, kē, líng, wù, dài*.\nSilently recite the Nine Heavens’ titles, the Nine Cycles, then from the *kǎn* position, lift the brush and swallow the saliva.\nAgain, upon the Thunder character, inscribe □, imprint the *nǜ* character, circulate the heart’s fire downward, and raise the kidneys’ water. Envision the sea’s black *qi* enveloping the red *qi*, coalescing into the *nǜ* character, then blow it forth to merge with the title as black clouds surge.\nFrom this, clouds and *qi* steam and swell, rain filling heaven and earth.\nContinue reciting the Nine Titles, Nine Cycles, then from the *kǎn* position, lift the brush and recite the *Bōzhā* incantation, dispatching as prescribed.\nIf no response occurs, summon, circulate, and inscribe the talisman, invoking the general and the title, following the prior method.\nUpon completion, inscribe the *guà* □ before the talisman, imprinting the *xiōng* title upon the chest.\nThen, within the Thunder character at the talisman’s base, inscribe the *guà* □, imprinting the *xuǎn* title. From the talisman’s base, drag the brush upward to the hand, then with utmost force, sweep a path of fire downward as swiftly as the wind, kicking open a rainway. Draw the ancestral *qi* and blow it within—this is the wondrous inversion of function.\nDispatch as before with the incantation. When summoning thunder and inscribing talismans, clench the teeth, hold the breath, and silently recite: *Ǒm niè □□□*, without counting the repetitions.\n\n**Refining the Spirit**\nEach night, sit upright, regulate the breath, concentrate the spirit, click the teeth, and close the eyes. Allow the divine light to naturally focus upon the Spirit Terrace, where the two *qi* spontaneously unite, forming a □ character of golden hue within. The heart and abdomen will feel aflame, enveloped in golden light, as if cinnabar.\n\nWithin the profound obscurity, behold the messenger—focus the intent unwaveringly, stilling all thoughts. When practicing, merely glance with heart and eyes toward the messenger, then raise and strike forth from the Thunder Gate, merging with the Celestial Gate’s messenger as one. Use at will, yet never lightly disclose; guard this secret most closely.\n\n**Ancestral *Qi* Entering the Talisman**\nVisualize the heart’s *qi* descending as kidney water ascends, the two *qi* uniting. With the □ character, draw them upward from the double passes of the spine, rolling forth from the mouth, then infuse this character into the talisman.\n\n**Hastening Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain**\nIf clouds have not risen or rain has not come, envision heart-fire descending into kidney water, forming a purple-gold hue. From between the brows, emit this 矿 character, hold the breath, and spray water toward the desired direction. Again visualize the 矿 character within the water, then employ the eight-character incantation to hasten.\n\n**Drawing Water from the Celestial River**\nVisualize the □ character beside the sixth star of the Southern Dipper, where a small star radiates golden light, descending into the Dipper’s mouth. Envision your body’s white *qi* in primordial chaos, ascending to meet the Celestial River’s golden light. Once the white *qi* is pierced by the golden light’s *qi*, behold the messenger. Then channel the waters of Caoxi, rising from the coccyx to Kunlun, reversing upward into the Celestial River. With a single spray, infuse the talisman, then swiftly flick the brush twice to animate it.\n\n**Secret Characters**\n□咦□□喝摄六咄□呢□呵五轰一。\n\n**Efficacious Talisman**\n**Five *Qi* Spirit Turtle**\nOne auspicious, two fitting—gather and restrain the wayless drought demons, rebellious ghosts, and lawless drought fiends.\n*Ǒm vā □ ra yung □ □ li svāhā*\n*Ǒm □ □ ra □ ra svāha*\n*Ǒm hūm li svā yung ta hā*\n\n**Five Directions, Five Thunder Messengers—Swiftly Descend with Five *Qi***\nThunderbolt golden light, swiftly manifest!\n*Chén xū dǒu tiān huáng jiāyē pīlì shè xū chén dǒu Ǒm hūm hūm, all spirits bow!

Next, summon the Nine Provinces’ Earth Deities and thunder spirits to assist the Five Thunder Generals. Tread upon the waterlogged regions, and wind, clouds, thunder, lightning, and rain shall erupt simultaneously.\n\n**Method**\nFirst, lift the *yǒu* character, beholding within the western Great Yin a 聻 character, round and luminous as the full moon on the fifteenth night. Inhale this golden *qi* along with moonlight into the lung meridian. Then swallow it down to the kidney palace, merging with the 聻 character, surging to ignite heart-fire. Again, inscribe the three characters 莫□行 in empty space. Draw in with the nose, absorb with the mouth, swallow into the heart meridian, stirring and rolling forth to obscure the sun and summon rain. Visualize this entering the efficacious talisman. When burning the talisman, perform likewise.\n\n**Alternative Method**\n**Horizontal Heaven Earl’s Edict**\n**Han Minister’s Law of Rotation**\n**True Thunder Yuan Bo’s Command**\nVisualize the talisman as a three-legged fox in the southern palace, stirring waves, churning the sea, summoning thunder, and invoking rain.\n\n**Incantation**\nThunder’s wrath, Heaven’s might,\nBreaching the Celestial Pool.\nMysterious Gate’s great abundance,\nDual luminaries, six instruments.\nClouds move, rain descends,\nThunder cracks, wind races.\n*Shā zhà hōng zhà, □ zhà lī zhà.*\nUpon reaching the true position,\nNone dare defy the true.\nHasten as the law commands!\n\n**Heavenly Attendants, Radiant Fragrance,**\n**Azure Toad, Purple Crow.**\nWater above, fire below,\nMerging and soaking.\nThunder and lightning follow the summons,\nWind and rain answer the call.\n*Yèchā* strike stone,\nThe nine lands flourish.\n*Axiāng* rides the steed,\nRaising thunder, invoking rain.\n*Chī hōng shā zhà lī.*\nHasten as the law commands!\n\n**Jade Decree Talisman**\n**Incantation**\n\n**Jade Decree of the Supreme Emperor,**\nProclaimed to the myriad thunder deities—\nHearken swiftly and act!\nDispatch and command thunder and lightning,\nSpread vast winds and clouds,\nBestow sweet rains universally,\nSweep away yin’s obscuring veils,\nGreatly succor all living beings.\nThe Jade Decree commands with urgency—\nExecute at once!\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the Jade Decree and Law of the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Heaven!*\n\nThe right-hand Jade Emperor Seal:\nInscribe in cinnabar upon iron leaves,\nCast into a water urn.\nOr write in cinnabar on yellow paper,\nBurn toward the void—\nSummon the thunder deities,\nAnd none shall disobey.\nThis talisman is the Supreme Emperor’s Decree;\nBurn it together with the command talisman,\nAnd the decree shall be executed.\n\n*Fǎhǎi Yízhū*, Scroll Seven, concludes.\n\n**#1 Esoteric Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Essence Envoys: The Divine Mechanism of Mystic Qi Concealment—Transmission of the Divine Empyrean’s Vibrant Methods.**\nAs recorded in *Dàofǎ Huìyuán*, Scrolls 83–87, *The Esoteric Scripture of Primordial Thunder Essence* states that this lineage was founded by the Azure Flower Emperor Lord Lǐ Yà, Fire Master Wāng Shǒuzhēn, and Attendant of the Celestial Throne Wáng Wénqīng. Later patriarchs include Bái Yùchán, Jīn Zhìyuǎn, Chén Zhòngjì, Zhào Zǐlín, and Mǐn Zǐwén.\n\n*Fǎhǎi Yízhū*, Scroll Eight: *Esoteric Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Essence Envoys: The Divine Mechanism of Mystic Qi Concealment.*\n\n**Methods for Summoning Thunder and Transforming Creation**\n\nEstablish the Five Phases’ mutual conquest as the signal. The head aligns with the *Kan* palace, while the inception arises from the gallbladder palace. Then recite the incantation *Jīn Guāng Chè Diàn Zhà* (\"Golden Light Pierces the Lightning Roar\"), repeating the five characters without counting the iterations.\n\n**Mechanism:**\nThe right signal emerges from the kidneys, passes through the five sense organs, and enters the sea of *qi*. A great thunderclap resounds, traversing the thirty-six barriers before bursting forth from the crown. The Five Thunders erupt in full force.\n\n**Inscribing the Golden Light in the *Xun* Palace**\n**Summoning Thunder: Oral Formula**\nThe master observes: \"The moon constantly conjoins *Xu* (11th Earthly Branch). Determine where the Celestial Pivot (*Tian’gang*) resides, face that direction, and visualize the Northern Dipper.\"\n\nNext, form the sword mudra and inscribe the character *lào* (炓) toward the Dipper’s mouth, imagining it flashing brilliantly. Visualize a strand of golden light surging from the glabella, shooting directly into that direction. With fury, inhale this character and guide it into the talisman with the sword mudra.\n\nAt this moment:\n- If the Celestial Pivot is in *Mao* (4th Branch), thunder arises.\n- If in *Si* (6th), wind.\n- If in *Wu* (7th), lightning.\n- If in *Zi* (1st), rain.\n- If in *Chen*, *Xu*, *Chou*, or *Wei* (5th, 11th, 2nd, 8th), clouds.\n\n**Redirecting Thunder**\nIf thunder resounds in the east, visualize the Northern Dipper fixed above. Use the sword mudra to inscribe *lào* at the Dipper’s mouth, then imagine golden light from the cinnabar field bursting from the celestial heart and shooting upward. With the sword mudra, guide it to another location to redirect the thunder’s response.\n\n**Heavenly Marshal Tianpeng Drives Thunder**\nVisualize the Nine *Qi* converging at the center, coalescing into a blue lotus seed. Suddenly, it splits open, revealing Marshal Tianpeng standing within, a single-horned *qiu* dragon at his right. Recite the command thrice, and the dragon roars while the marshal rages. The adept, likewise enraged, dispatches them to hasten the thunder envoys and command the myriad thunders.\n\n**The Blue Lotus Seed Contains Creation**\n**Lightning-Commanding Mudra**\nVirtually inscribe the character *□* in the right palm and *□* in the left. Rub the palms together until scorching hot, then visualize a golden light orb within. Next, imagine a golden *lào* character suspended in the clouds ahead.\n\nThe adept flicks the palms’ signal, transmuting it into a golden fire-star. With both palms facing outward, shoot the golden light—electrical radiance blazes, illuminating the vast sky.\n\nRecite:\n*\"Chaos of heaven and sea-mountains, lightning streams forth in brilliance—divine mechanism seizes!*\n*Golden light wrenches the lightning roar!*\n*Command: Cloud-lightning, swiftly arise!\"*\n\nUpon concluding the incantation, visualize two strands of golden light from the palms shooting toward the star, drawing forth the lightning’s surge.\n\n**Seal this method; do not neglect it.**\n\n**Method for Praying for Snow**\nThe master instructs: To invoke snow, conceal the moon and gather the Five Stars at the Eastern Well (*Dongjing*). Auspicious *qi* will flow abundantly—this is called \"assembling the Five Phases and harmonizing the Four Symbols.\" When the *dui*-harmony and *zhao*-harmony converge, auspicious *qi* arrives.\n\nAdd the character *du* (朒) beneath the talisman and overlay it with the Five Stars. Visualize the Great Yin (*Taiyin*) at the zenith, imagining the brush as the original star. The four remaining stars coalesce into auspicious *qi* and harmonious *qi*, suffusing mountains, rivers, and the Six Directions. The Six Flowers scatter and disperse, drifting across heaven and earth.\n\nThen wield the brush and recite:\n*\"Flying heaven’s sudden fire, revolving the eastern numen!*\n*High ministers and immortal lords, auspicious light gathers and congeals!*\n*Stiff winds shear water, transforming into jade forests!*\n*The Six Directions dispel calamity; the hundred grains receive essence!*\n*Majestic light rectifies the order; heaven and earth grow solemn and clear!*\n*True kings spread transformation; divine marvels adorn the Jade Capital!\"*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Great Yin Moon Emperor’s decree commands!*\n\nUpon concluding the incantation, extend the brush toward the designated direction.\n\n**Secret Principles of Opening and Closing**\n- *Qian* (Heaven Gate)\n- *Kan* (Rain Cavern)\n- *Gen* (Ghost Path)\n- *Zhen* (Thunder Cavern)\n- *Xun* (Earth Door, Wind Cavern)\n- *Li* (Fire Cavern)\n- *Kun* (Human Gate)\n- *Dui* (Marshal)\n\n**Correspondences:**\n- Wind (Wood)\n- Clouds (Earth)\n- Thunder (Wood)\n- Lightning (Fire)\n- Rain (Water)\n- Hail (Metal)\n- Frost (Metal)\n- Snow (Water)\n\nThese methods all pertain to the Five Phases, each governed by the cycle of generation and conquest. Generation brings completion; conquest brings destruction. Employ generation while avoiding conquest; employ conquest while avoiding generation. Thus, summoning wind and raising thunder—transformative marvels—never depart from the Five Phases.\n\n**Raising Wind:**\nTread open the wind cavern, seal the rain cavern, and firmly tread the cloud cavern—then the wind arises.\n\n**Stilling Wind:**\nTread open the rain path, sever the wind path with the sword mudra, and seal the wind cavern to gather the wind.\n\n**Summoning Thunder:**\nSever the wind path, seal the rain gate, open the cloud path to raise clouds, then kick open the thunder aperture—thunder resounds.\n\n**Dispersing Thunder:**\nOpen the wind path, seal the cloud path, close the thunder aperture, and the thunder disperses.\n\n**Raising Clouds:**\nKick open the rain path, kick the wind cavern, and open the cloud cavern—clouds arise.\n\n**Dispersing Clouds:**\nOpen the wind path, seal the cloud cavern, and open the fire cavern.\n\n**Praying for Rain:**\nOpen the cloud cavern, wind cavern, rain cavern, and thunder cavern. If wind, clouds, and thunder are present, seal the wind cavern, then close the thunder cavern while fully opening the rain cavern—rain will arise.\n\n**Ceasing Rain:**\nOpen the wind cavern and fire cavern, dispersing the cloud cavern—rain will naturally cease.\n\n**Memorializing Affairs:**\n- Open the Heaven Gate to shift inauspicious stars.\n- Open the Heaven Gate to extinguish fire calamities.\n\n**Opening the Heaven Gate**\n**Refinement and Salvation:**\nOpen the Earth Door to treat illness.\n\n**Opening the Human Gate**\n**Treating Possession:**\nOpen the Ghost Path to capture malevolent spirits.\n\n**Sealing the Ghost Path**\n**Severing Demonic Influence:**\nBlock the Ghost Path.\n\n**Threefold Command of the Celestial Pivot**\n- **Celestial Pivot for Praying for Rain:** *Shen*, *Zi*, *Chen* (9th, 1st, 5th Branches)\n- **Treating Illness:** *Hai*, *Mao*, *Wei* (12th, 4th, 8th)\n- **Praying for Clear Skies:** *Yin*, *Wu*, *Xu* (3rd, 7th, 11th)\n- **Punitive Expeditions:** *Si*, *You*, *Chou* (6th, 10th, 2nd)\n\n**Master’s Secrets**\nWind has caverns; clouds have chambers.\n- **Wind Cavern:** Align breath and *qi*, attuning to the *Xun* door corresponding to the western season—this must not be unknown.\n- **Cloud Chamber:** Clouds conceal within mountains and peaks. Through *Dui* Metal conquering Wood, sharp edges stir mist, forming clouds and fog.\n\n**Iron Talisman**\nOnce the talisman is completed, further imbue it with the flickering radiance of sunlight. The *Wu* (7th) and *Yue* (Moon) cycles ensure boundless efficacy.\n\n**Child (Zi) Incantation**\nBy the command of the Supreme Emperor, I hereby summon the Thunder Gods.\nAt *Wu* (7th), clouds surge and lightning sweeps; at *Wu*, wind and fire intertwine.\nAt *Mao* (4th), obey my talismanic decree; at *Chou* (2nd), fire swiftly illuminates.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Jade Pure Supreme Emperor’s statutes and decrees!*\n\nThe talisman is to be inscribed on an iron plaque, three *cun* and six *fen* in width, nine *cun* in length.

Don your robe, then rub your hands together until they grow scorching hot. Mimic washing your face, and wipe your eyes. Open them, exhale the turbid *qi* from your abdomen, and draw in pure *qi* through your nose to fill your heart and belly. Strike your teeth three times, and visualize your Original Destiny Perfected within your brows, standing in your likeness.\n\nNext, recite the *Incantation for Gathering Spirits*:\n*\"True King within the radiance, your might shakes the Nine Heavens.\nHands cradle the Three Pristine, feet tread the Nine Mysteries.\nGolden Tiger veils the sun, Azure Dragon coils the *Qian*.\nYellow Spirit wields iron, Green-Toothed lashes the whip.\nPatrolling the Five Peaks, harmonizing the Seven Primes.\nBy imperial decree, I transform and prolong life.\nSince the Great Ultimate first stirred, years have passed for me.\nNow wielding talismanic command, I grasp authority’s thunder.\nWind and thunder clash, lightning roars in fury.\nDividing day from night, I examine ghosts to their roots.\nMaster of the Thunder Bureau—justice knows no bias.\nAll I command must obey my word.\nSwift as the law’s decree!\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, visualize your primordial spirit ascending to pay homage to the True King. Three *cun* above the brows lies the True King’s palace. Next, envision the Ten Officials and Great Unity Perfected Lords encircling you.\n\nRecite the next incantation:\n*\"Jade Clarity congeals brilliance, the Nine *Qi* arise naturally.\nTransformations birth spirits across the Thirty-Six Heavens.\nSun and moon’s majestic light, thunder chariots vast as clouds.\nHeaven azure, earth black—annihilate demons, purge spirits.\nI now examine and judge, all heavens descend in audience.\nWind flies, lightning turns—ten thousand spirits obey.\nSwift as the Primordial One *Qi* Heavenly Lord’s decree!\"*\n\nNext, visualize the nine *qi* of the liver, emerald-hued, ascending to coil around the *Milo* Heaven. Then envision the three *qi* of the south, crimson, merging with the heart to form golden *qi*, blending within the spleen’s palace. Briefly hold your breath, and exhale this golden *qi* from the spleen to encircle your body.\n\nWith both hands, first lift the left external kidney with your left hand. Hold your breath once, and visualize kidney water surging upward then descending, uniting with heart fire to coalesce at the navel wheel. Press your tongue against your lower teeth, awaiting the water’s rise and fire’s descent. Swallow into the lung’s palace, where golden light intertwines, forming a Perfected who ascends to pay homage to the Primordial Void Emperor.\n\nRecite the *Lesser Golden Light Incantation*, swallow saliva three times, then stretch your hands to circulate the *qi* through mountains and peaks. The practice concludes—sleep as if in the outer Dipper.\n\n**Rainbow Manifestation Method**\nBefore noon, face west; after noon, face east. Assume the thunder mudra with your hands, gaze at the sun, and recite:\n*\"Sun’s soul, vermilion radiance, gleams through green jade.\nCrimson lads of returning mist, dark flames in whirlwind guise.\nBy my oral decree, swiftly reveal your true form!\nA thousand-mile rainbow, five-colored barrier.\nSwift by the Solar Emperor’s command!\"*\n\nAdditional incantation:\n*\"Rainbow, appear swiftly! Rain divides east and west.\nHasten! Stretch across the sky! Fill the void!\"*\n\nAfter reciting, exhale three breaths—it will manifest instantly in the air.\n\n**Shenxiao True Writ for Summoning Thunder and Invoking Rain**\nWrite every four characters as a separate line.\n\nUse azure paper, one *chi* and six *cun* long, inscribed in cinnabar. Face the *xun* direction to summon thunder spirits. Cast it into a dragon pool or present it to the Thunder Bureau—responses are unfailing. Writing one or two characters can cure myriad illnesses, expel all malevolence, and ensure safe passage through storms, dragons, or other perils. Upon achieving mastery, wear it to ascend to the Jade Clarity Heaven of Shenxiao, becoming an attendant minister of the Golden Towers.\n\nTo treat madness or demonic afflictions, add the *Xuhuo* talisman—results are immediate.\n\n**Convenient Talismans**\n*Eastern Barbarian Thunder Envoy Ma Yulin, swiftly arise!

sword,\nriding a fire chariot descending from the south.\n\nVisualize the yang qi of my body emerging from the lower cinnabar field,\nblending and spreading into the talisman.\n\n**Talisman for Qi Supplementation**\n\n**Quiet Stabilization and Talisman Inscription**\nIn stillness, inscribe these two characters—*hēng* and *xián*—within the circle. Once the talisman is complete, recite the *Celestial Numen’s Splendor Mantra*. Draw in the eastern *qi*, then trace the following sequence: *gé-sì-zhèng-chén-jī-mǎo-gāng-yín-héng*, marking each on the thumb—first the upper joint, then the middle, then the root. Repeat and inscribe the *shà* character.\n\n**The Divine Empyrean’s Supreme Dao: Transmission of the Divine Empyrean’s Vibrant Teachings**\n\n**Arcane Secrets of Thunder’s Mechanism**\n**The Flying *Gang* and Interlocking *Qian* for Deploying the Dipper**\n\nThe Fire Master said: The Jade Clarity’s hidden language, the Primordial Origin’s secret texts—these are not for the uninitiated to hear. Once, the True King of Jade Clarity transmitted them to the Five Marchmounts’ Elders, who then passed them to the world.\n\nThunder and lightning are the *qi* of yin and yang clashing fiercely. There is the divine being Xie Xianhuo, the supreme commander of the seventy-two divisions of wind and fire. And there is the mighty spirit Deng Bowen, who wields the authority to issue decrees, burn demonic shrines, topple temples, summon rain, and command clear skies—he is the marshal of the Thunder Department’s statutes and ordinances.\n\nThose who uphold this method must practice it with care. Each year, during the three days before and after the *Jingzhe* (Awakening of Insects) festival in mid-spring, when thunder first sounds, enter profound meditation and transform the spirit as prescribed. Fill yourself with the *gang qi*, purify the viscera, and amplify divine might.\n\nNext, form the Five Thunder Seal, retract the claws and conceal the nails, cross the arms at the waist, sit upright, and with a stern voice and fierce countenance, shake the Gate of Heaven. Draw in the *qi* of lightning to align with the yang’s nine-by-nine configuration. From the earth gate, gather the *qi* of thunderfire to correspond with the yin’s six-by-six completion. Seize the lightning and flying thunder, and contain them within the primordial palace. Conceal them in the *Kan* trigram; whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, maintain this practice.\n\nWhenever thunder and lightning converge, act without delay. With sufficient *qi*, you may summon thunder in broad daylight, and it will naturally respond. In spring and summer, visualize the Wind Earl and Rain Master, the Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother, descending swiftly from the sky. In autumn and winter, envision thunder and lightning emerging from the stars and constellations.\n\nFor regular use, dispatch an observer to note the direction from which ominous clouds or malevolent winds arise. The ritual master then gathers primordial *qi*, hurls lightning, and roars thunder toward that direction, releasing it from the crown of the head. The response will arrive within an hour. After three years of practice, every invocation will yield immediate results.\n\nWhen summoning thunder, form the Five Thunder Seal and issue the command from *xū-hài* to *shēn*. Once the method is mastered, practice diligently to wield Heaven’s authority, succor the people and all beings, and expel demonic forces—this is no trifling matter.\n\nThe adept’s spirit merges with the divine, and their essence flows in communion with Heaven and Earth. Though Heaven and Earth are said to be eighty-four thousand *li* apart, the adept’s spirit traverses this distance within their own body. Thus, the myriad transformations arise within the self, and the cosmos rests in the palm of the hand.\n\nReflect deeply upon this, guard it well, and do not disclose it to the unworthy. The Dao does not betray those who attain it; through diligent effort and unwavering focus, one naturally achieves transcendence.\n\n**Master Wan’s Transmission** states: Thunder withdraws its voice in the eighth month, concealing itself beneath the *Kun* earth. From the eighth month (*yǒu*) to the tenth (*hài*), it nurtures within the three yin. From the eleventh month (*zǐ*) to the first (*yín*), it matures within the three yang. Only after the interplay of three yin and three yang does it resound in the second month (*mǎo*), marking the inception of Heaven and Earth’s generation and the first stirrings of all things. It must extend its pent-up emotions and release its stagnant *qi*, causing the pulse of Heaven and Earth to quake and the vitality of life to flow. Without great power, such a vast release would be impossible. After half a year of accumulation, it erupts in a single day—nothing in the myriad things can resist it, for it is the earth’s surplus blackness venting forth.\n\nThus, the day of its emergence is not arbitrary: it may be *wù-jǐ*, *chén-xū-chǒu-wèi*, or the day of *Lìchūn* (Beginning of Spring), all tied to the earth’s resonance with the cyclical signs of generation. Though exceptions exist, eight or nine out of ten cases align with this pattern. This is why the sages of old drew upon these correspondences to model the divine thunder’s fire.\n\nFor when the first yang returns and takes form beneath *wù-jǐ*, its momentum becomes irresistible. Thus, the creative forces of half a year’s decree must be nurtured in concealment for another half-year before their power is realized—how could this be a shallow matter?\n\n**Lightning Incantation**\n*Lightning, lightning,*\nemerging from the *Kan* direction.\nSpewing fire for ten thousand *li*,\nascending to the Celestial Palace.\nI invoke the Emperor’s salvation,\ndrawing it into the heart’s sovereign.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as lightning seizes!*\n\n**Jade Emperor’s Personal Mechanism Talisman and Mudra**\nWind as Heaven, *yín* fire as Earth,\n* sì* the sun and moon as conduits,\n*shēn* the four mountains to command and restrain.\n*hài* mountain’s fire blazes,\n*yín* mountain’s fire blazes,\n*mǎo* severs, *chén* severs, *sì* annihilates, *sì* seizes.\nAt *wǔ*, thunderfire emerges—point backward and flick once.\n\n**By Decree of the Three Clarities’ Emperors:**\nJade Clarity’s Supreme Emperor,\nSupreme Clarity’s Supreme Emperor,\nGrand Clarity’s Great Emperor,\nThunder Ancestor’s True August Emperor.\n\n**Constellation Decrees:**\n*Jiǎo, Kàng, Dǐ, Fáng, Xīn, Wěi, Jī,*\n*Dǒu, Niú, Nǚ, Xū, Wēi, Shì, Bì,*\n*Kuí, Lóu, Wèi, Mǎo, Bì, Zī, Shēn,*\n*Jǐng, Liǔ, Xīng, Zhāng, Guǐ, Yì, Zhěn.*\n\n**Five Planets’ True Lords:**\nMetal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth Star Lords.\nPalace of the Sun, Palace of the Moon.\nEastern Well and *Jī* Envoys, Thunder Duke,\nTwenty-Four *Qi* Thunder Dukes, Twelve Hourly Thunder Dukes,\nThirty-Six Celestial Dragon Thunder Hosts.\n\n**Thunder Summons:**\nHeavenly Thunder, rise swiftly!\nWater Thunder, rise swiftly!\nDragon Thunder, rise swiftly!\nDivine Thunder, rise swiftly!\nEarth Altar Thunder, rise swiftly!\nAs Heaven and Earth darken and sun and moon lose their light,\nthe Five Directions’ Thunder Gods descend swiftly to the Mystic Altar’s precinct.\n\nClose the eyes, rotate nine times, and with a single stroke ascend past the character *shān*.\n\n**Incantation:**\nFirst rotation: the cosmos quakes.\nSecond rotation: fierce winds arise swiftly.\nThird rotation: yin thunder merges.\nFourth rotation: the Great Monad’s *Lí* Palace.\nFifth rotation: the Five Thunders rise swiftly.\nSixth rotation: thunderbolts surge and strike.\nSeventh rotation: the Jade Talisman descends.\nEighth rotation: the myriad spirits hasten to obey.\nNinth rotation: thunder, lightning, wind, and rain—\nflying sand and hurtling stones—\nburst forth from the earth gate,\ndescend to the altar’s seat,\nhear the command and act,\ndare not disobey the decree!\n\nThe Thunder Ancestor, True August Emperor, descends with thunderous decree by the karmic law.

Leaping one palace to *yín*, this is the *wùwǔ* year’s beginning. The Grand Year then starts from its position, moving counterclockwise through consecutive palaces to find the current month. From the month, proceed clockwise through consecutive palaces, beginning the count at the *hài* hour and continuing to *mǎo*—this is the thunder-slaying direction.\n\nWhere it begins is the thunder, where it ceases is the lightning.\n**Method for Determining the Starting Month:**\nThe Grand Year’s earthly branch marks the start of the first month.\nMoving counterclockwise, seek the current month to know its position.\nFrom the month’s position, proceed clockwise beginning at the *hài* hour;\nthe starting point is the thunder-slaying force, counting to the *mǎo* palace where the slaying spirit’s heart resides.\nWhere it ceases, the slaying becomes lightning.\nIf thunder and lightning are raised to excite the slaying force,\neven a vajra will be reduced to dust.\n\n**Directions for Major Slaying Forces on Inauspicious Days and Hours (Metal Tiger, Flowing Fire, and Malevolent Stars):**\n*Jiǎ* and *yǐ* reside in *kūn*; *wù* and *guǐ* in *xī*—proceed clockwise from *jiǎzǐ*.\n*Yǐ* and *gēng* occupy *lí*, moving counterclockwise from *jiǎzǐ*.\n*Dīng* and *rén* shift clockwise from *xùn*.\nFrom *xùn*, begin at *jiǎzǐ*; *bǐng* and *xīn* stir thunder in *zhèn*—fly counterclockwise into the central palace for careful reckoning.\nFirst determine whether the flight is clockwise or counterclockwise.\nExamine the day’s cyclical sign to see which *jiǎ* sequence it belongs to,\nthen count from the head of that decade to the day’s position.\nFrom the day’s position, begin at the *zǐ* hour and count to the desired hour—\nthis is the direction where the major slaying force descends.\nIf clockwise, proceed clockwise; if counterclockwise, proceed counterclockwise.\nUpon reaching the central palace, lodge it in the *kūn* position for application.\n\n**Example:**\nIn the *wùwǔ* year, the seventh month, thirteenth day (*gēngshēn* day),\nbegin counterclockwise from *jiǎzǐ*.\nStart from *wǔ* with the six *jiǎ* signs:\n*jiǎzǐ*, *jiǎxū*, *jiǎshēn*, *jiǎwǔ*, *jiǎchén*, *jiǎyín*, *jiǎyín* (repeated in *xùn* and *zhèn*),\nthen begin *yǐmǎo* and proceed through the sequence to the desired day.\nFrom there, add the *zǐ* hour and count to the desired hour—\nthis is the major slaying force.\nThe rest follow this example.\nFor the *jiǎzǐ* decade, do not seek the *jiǎ* head; instead, count the six *jiǎ* from *yǐchǒu*.\n\n**Qi Formula for Flying Slaying Forces:**\n*Jiǎ* and *jǐ* dragons fly as the cock crows at dawn;\n*chén* and *yǒu* see *yǐ* and *gēng* tigers roar, fearing the flight of the ram.\nFrom *yín*, *wèi* emerges; *bǐng* and *xīn* share the qi of monkey and dog.\nFrom *shēn* and *xū*, *dīng* and *rén* return to the southern palace’s *kǎn* gate.\nFrom *wǔ* and *zǐ*, *wù* and *guǐ* thunder issues from the *duì* palace;\nfrom *mǎo* and *yǒu*, celestial thunder’s slaying power flourishes with heavenly mechanism.\nAll under heaven’s demonic forces dread it,\nas thunderbolts cleave the sky with flashing lightning.\nOn *jiǎjǐ* days, the Metal Tiger’s hidden thunder lies in *chén*;\non *sì* days, in *yǒu*—face this direction to pace the Dipper,\nburn talismans according to the method, and command with a shout.\n**Adaptations for Wind-Fire Mandates:**\n1.

All fortune and misfortune, regret and shame in a person’s life are subject to its sway. The methods of petitioning the Dipper, transmitted by sages of former ages, each possess manifest efficacy. The purposes of such petitions vary, each with its own specialization.\n\nOur Patriarch, Sun the Perfected, in his flight of spirit to audience with the Thearch, chanced upon the Nine Heavens Mysterious Woman, who bestowed upon him this swift and essential whispered petition. The method is named *Stove Register*, and the lamp is called *Thousand Eyes*, dedicated to memorializing the Controller of Fate. Though the text is brief, its efficacy is swift.\n\nThe Controller of Fate is the Nine Heavens Efficacious Fire Primordial Lord, commissioned by the Heavenly Thearch to memorialize the affairs of the human realm. All prayers and supplications are invariably answered, for this is the utmost Dao in its unadorned simplicity. The Perfected, moved by compassion for the people of the world, transmitted it to later learners. Those who obtain it should preserve and revere it; it must not be shown to the unworthy.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Li Xisheng.\n\n---\n\n### **The Precious Register of the Mysterious Numinous for Prolonging Life, Delivering from Distress, and Dispersing Calamities**\nWith utmost reverence, I present this petition, unable to refuse the sincerity of the supplicant. I have heard that the Great Thearch, in his boundless grace, expounds the teachings of the Supreme True, while the August Elder proclaims the decrees of the Jade Bureau, and the Northern Dipper bestows the *Book of the Mysterious Numinous*. Its profundities defy description; its sagely power is unfathomable.\n\nFacing the Northern Culmen, I inscribe this talisman and register, recording the supplicant’s circumstances in accordance with ancestral protocols. Entrusted to the Controller of Fate for presentation, it ascends to the office of the Throat and Tongue, and descends to relieve the afflictions of the heart and viscera. May swift response be granted to fulfill this devout prayer.\n\nAll true talismans shall be duly proclaimed and enacted.\n\n**Void Talisman**\n\nThis talisman and register are dedicated to resolving for [Name] the Three Calamities and Four Baleful Influences, the Five Phases and Six Harms, the Seven Injuries and Eight Difficulties, the Nine Stars in fate, destiny, and life’s allotted span, and all inauspicious spirits and malevolent forces encountered in the current year—distresses of Heavenly Nets and Earthly Snares.\n\nI humbly beseech the Lord Controller of Fate to transmit this sincerity and memorialize it to the Star Lords of the Northern Dipper. Moved by pity for this ignorant mortal, may they assent to my plea. May they specially bestow sagely power and Dao-power, and by the efficacy of this talisman and dharma-power, protect and bless [Name]. May all afflictions be instantly healed, all distresses resolved, all enmities and grudges reconciled, all curses dissolved, all impurities shattered, all demonic influences expelled, all karmic retribution pardoned, all official plagues dispersed, and all ruin and decay steadfastly upheld. May all wishes be fulfilled, truly by the grace of the Mysterious.\n\n[Name], daring to trespass upon your sagely might, prostrates in utmost submission, awaiting your decree.\n\nRespectfully submitted on the [Day] of the [Month] of the [Year], at the hour of [Time].\n\nThe humble servant [Name], bearing the mandate, respectfully executes this.\n\n**To the Great Thearch of the Central Heaven, Northern Culmen, Purple Tenuity, Subduer of Demons.**\n\n**Sealed Memorial**\nTo the Great Sage of the Central Heaven, the Nine August Star Lords of the Northern Dipper, the Extenders of Life:\n\nYour humble servant [Name], bearing the mandate, respectfully seals this.\n\n**Envelope Inscription:**\n*The Precious Record of the Mysterious Numinous for Prolonging Life, Delivering from Distress, and Dispersing Calamities*\nRespectfully submitted to the Palace of the Nine August Star Lords of the Northern Dipper, Central Heaven Great Sage.\n\nThe humble servant [Name] respectfully seals this.\n\n**Controller of Fate’s Petition**\n**Thunderclap Capital Bureau**\n\nThe present bureau hereby reports:\n\nHaving received the full particulars of the petitioner’s intent, and having prepared the talismanic registers, we now commission and urgently dispatch this missive to be respectfully presented before the Nine August Star Lords of the Northern Dipper in the Central Heaven. We humbly submit this entreaty, beseeching the gracious mandate to absolve [Name] of all former transgressions and accumulated calamities, dissolving each without exception and removing all obstacles.\n\nWe have already instructed the altar-attendant to purify and prepare at the household’s Stove Bureau offerings of incense, ritual images, and rice, and to light lamps in awaiting the command. We now request that the bureau be informed of the manifest response, so that further action may be taken accordingly.

invoke curses. Wealth and property dissipate. The northeast altar grows cold.\n\nFor **Jùmén Star (Great Gate)**: Either offending earth and wood, or due to official litigation and curses—this arises when the Wood and Fire Stars converge and descend.\n\nFor **Lùcún Star (Wealth Storage)**: Entangled in the misfortune of nets; the household dims. Blood-light female ghosts bring calamity.\n\nFor **Wénqǔ Star (Literary Brilliance)**: The western altar turns cold; the household’s qi darkens. Petitioning the Great Yang brings fortune.\n\nFor **Liánzhēn Star (Integrity and Chastity)**: The Fire Star of fate shines upon officials; household members face disasters and fire misfortunes. The directional deities and yearly spirits are offended, causing illness in men and women.\n\nFor **Wǔqǔ Star (Martial Brilliance)**: Death ghosts in childbirth; the southern altar chills. Relatives perish in succession, harmed by Wood Guests.\n\nFor **Pòjūn Star (Breaking Army)**: Stars move inauspiciously—hanging ghosts bring legal punishments, disputes, and oral conflicts. The southern altar cools; ghosts afflict the young with misfortune.\n\nFor **Zuǒfǔ Star (Left Assistant)**: Celestial bureaus invoke northern yin vows.\n\nFor **Yòubì Star (Right Assistant)**: Knife wounds, fire burns, and ghostly malice.\n\nFor **Běnmìng Star (Life Star)**: Stars move inauspiciously; black departs without salvation, severing ominous omens.\n\nFor **Seven Stars (Collective Diminished)**: Frequent calamities plague the household; the young face unforeseen dangers. All affairs are unfavorable; the sick grow worse.\n\n---\n\n**Rice Stirred (米动):**\nFor **Tānláng Star**: Celestial bureaus impose punishments; past transgressions must be guarded against and repented.\n\nFor **Jùmén Star**: The Yuefu’s seventy-two offices and city gods issue yin retributions.\n\nFor **Lùcún Star**: Fortune spirits weaken; slaves, servants, and external ghosts bring harm. They should be pacified and sent away.\n\nFor **Wénqǔ Star**: Bewitched by others; the household grows restless, and husband and wife discord.\n\nFor **Liánzhēn Star**: Disturbing earth offends the official tally, bringing official disasters and severe illness to men and women.\n\nFor **Wǔqǔ Star**: The stars of the year’s fate and destiny’s limits turn unfavorable.\n\nFor **Pòjūn Star**: Small fortune.\n\nFor **Zuǒfǔ Star**: Ancestral graves and feng shui turn unfavorable, leading to tomb disputes and summons.\n\nFor **Yòubì Star**: Wood Guests and mountain demons cause disturbances and harm.\n\nFor **Běnmìng Star**: Petition the Dipper to exorcise and give thanks.\n\nFor **Seven Stars (Collective Stirred)**: [No additional text provided.]\n\n---\n\n**Rice Increased (米添):**\nFor **Tānláng Star**: Conduct a grand jiào ritual to give thanks; this invites wealth.\n\nFor **Jùmén Star**: Attracts fields and dwellings from external lineages.\n\nFor **Lùcún Star**: Brings added wealth and population.\n\nFor **Wénqǔ Star**: Pray for blessings to bear a noble son.\n\nFor **Liánzhēn Star**: Gains windfall wealth or uncanny arts.\n\nFor **Wǔqǔ Star**: Attracts wealth, property, and ancient artifacts.\n\nFor **Pòjūn Star**: Brings promotions and salary increases; for commoners, wealth and joyous events.\n\nFor **Zuǒfǔ Star**: Household members remain safe and fortunate.\n\nFor **Yòubì Star**: Legal matters disperse; household members thrive.\n\nFor **Běnmìng Star**: The household flourishes; wealth increases, bringing fortune.\n\nFor **Seven Stars (Collective Increased)**: [No additional text provided.]\n\n---\n\n**Method of Practice:**\nUse one lamp, divided into nine branches. Place a Thousand-Eyed Lamp atop it, covering the Stove Controller’s altar. Arrange twenty-four portions of incense, lamps, pure tea, wine, and fruit. Set up a Dipper of white, pure rice in the designated location. The ritual master recites incantations silently, without uttering a sound.\n\nAlternatively, burn these offerings directly. Use a set of golden paper money, horses, and Stove Ritual implements, burning them in the stove.\n\n**Judgment:**\nWhen the stars’ rice blackens, the master perishes.\nWhen the stars gather, epidemics arise.\nWhen the stars vanish, lifespans end.\nWhen the stars remain still, the sick recover.\nWhen rice increases, wealth and longevity bring all fortune.\nWhen rice diminishes, misfortune surely follows.\nIf people do not trust Master Sun’s method,\nHow can later learners determine fortune or misfortune?\n\n*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Thirteen concludes.*\n\n---\n*#1 The \"Mysterious Petition in Silence\" aligns closely with the content in* **Daoist Methods Compendium, Scroll 216: \"Nine Heavens Mystic Woman’s Stove Petition Secret Method\"**—*though phrasing varies, they may be cross-referenced.*\n*#2 The \"Lamp-Lighting and Rice-Spreading Incantation\" in* **Nine Heavens Mystic Woman’s Stove Petition Secret Method** *is divided into two: one called the \"Lamp-Lighting Incantation,\" the other the \"Dipper-Spreading Incantation.\"*\n\n*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Fourteen*\n*Petitioning the Dipper for Longevity Method #1*\n\nThe Lineage Masters:\nAncestral Master Wang Xingzhen, Supreme Perfection Realized Person of Wangwu Mountain.\nAncestral Master Zhongli Quan Yunfang, Perfected Lord of Upright Yang’s Enlightenment and Dao Transmission.\nAncestral Master Zheng Siyuan, Supreme Perfection Internal Assistant Realized Person.\nAncestral Master Lü Yan Dongbin, Pure Yang Numinous Treasure Perfected Lord.\nLineage Master Zhang Guolao, Penetrating Mystery Realized Person.\nLineage Master Bai Yuchan, Purple Clarity Settled Wisdom Realized Person, Master of the Jade Toad.\n\n**Recognizing the Three Terraces Method**\nThe Three Terraces comprise six stars, positioned above the Dipper’s handle, aligned in pairs. Men who recognize them avoid imprisonment’s misfortunes; women who recognize them escape the perils of childbirth. Those who cultivate immortality and refine the true must especially know them.\n\nWhenever the Three Terraces’ six stars are seen, clasp hands in reverence, visualize the bow, and silently recite the incantation:\n*\"Upper Terrace: Void Essence,\nMiddle Terrace: Sixfold Purity,\nLower Terrace: Curved Life.\nErase this servant’s name from death’s register,\nInscribe this servant’s name for eternal life.\nPromote to lofty rank,\nEnthroned in Heaven’s court.\nHeart and mind brighten,\nEars and eyes grow keen.\nThree souls endure forever,\nExtending life a thousand years.\nAscend to the Golden Gate,\nGaze upon Jade Clarity.\nRide the dragon, mount the clouds,\nAttain the rank of Immortal Minister.\nHasten, hasten, as the statutes command!\"*\n\n*\"The Three Terraces gave me birth,\nThe Three Terraces nurtured me,\nThe Three Terraces protect me.\nHasten, hasten, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nAfter reciting, gaze toward the stars’ celestial path, seek the grace of the Dao, offer prayers as you wish, bow thrice in the heart, and click the teeth three times before withdrawing.\n\n**Seeking the Imperial Throne Method**\nThe two stars at the Dipper’s mouth—the Venerable Star on the left, the Imperial Star on the right—shine like the sun and moon upon those of the Dao, but not upon the unvirtuous. Those who see the Venerable Star live three hundred years; those who see the Imperial Star live six hundred years.\n\nOn the third and twenty-seventh nights of each month, await their appearance. This must be done in the quiet of night, unknown to others. When the two stars appear, seek the Dao with wholehearted devotion, and tell no one. If one lacks perseverance, sincerity, or discipline, or grows lax midway, the stars will not be seen.\n\nThose who refine the true should secretly pray to them often, never revealing the stars’ names to the unworthy. Keep them constantly in mind, and in times of need, silently invoke their names. Never face north to weep, disrobe, or let hair loose beneath the stars’ light—this is the strictest prohibition.\n\nWhen awaiting the two stars, first pace the Dipper, burn incense, and bow twice, visualizing the Dipper’s mouth where the two stars appear like the sun and moon. Then recite the incantation:\n*\"Venerable and Imperial Stars,\nSpirits of the Northern Culmen.\nMay this servant soon behold you,\nAnd upon seeing, attain eternal life.\nInscribe this servant as a flying immortal,\nStrike this servant’s name from death’s register.\nBoundless fortune and blessings,\nEqual to Heaven’s years.\nSwiftly ascend to the Immortal Capital,\nSoar through Supreme Clarity.\nHasten, hasten, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nBow twice more, envisioning the two stars descending in purple cloud-qi, entering through your Mud-Pill Palace and bathing your eyes. Recite the incantation again:\n*\"Venerable and Imperial Stars,\nSpirits of the Northern Culmen.\nNow revealed, now concealed,\nGrant this servant eternal life.\nInscribe this servant as a flying immortal,\nStrike this servant’s name from death’s register.\nBoundless fortune and blessings,\nEqual to Heaven’s years.\nSoon transcend the Three Realms,\nRoam through Supreme Clarity.\nHasten, hasten, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nAfter reciting, bow twice more, stand briefly in stillness, focus the spirit, and gaze at the Dipper’s mouth while silently repeating the incantation seven times. Then withdraw for a short while. If the stars appear, bow again and pray for longevity, offering your heartfelt wishes. Continue nightly worship without interruption—any lapse nullifies all prior merit.\n\nThose of disciplined conduct who refine the true may transcend the mortal and enter the sagely, ascending to serve the Jade Emperor. Those who practice this with utmost dedication attain eternal life and ascend upon merit’s fulfillment. Ordinary practitioners extend their years. Do not reveal this to the unworthy; treasure and guard it well.\n\nFormerly, Supreme Perfection Realized Person of Wangwu Mountain transmitted this to Master Zhang Guolao, who practiced it in secret and later ascended as an immortal, becoming one of the ancient sagely transcendents.\n\n**Secret Crane-Summoning Method #2**\nCranes come in many kinds: the Bamboo Crane of Dongcheng, the Reed Crane of Jibin, the Soaring Crane of Huaishan, and the Feather Crane of Qingcheng Mountain—these are the common traditions of past and present. As when Celestial Master Han rode the Nine Clouds Crane, Perfected Lord Xu mounted the Wind-Riding Crane, Ge Zhichuan flew the Jade Mist Crane, and Perfected Lord Zhongli Zhengyang ascended on the Grand Empyrean Crane—such accounts are indeed true.\n\nThe proverb says: \"The stork bears three offspring, one of which is a crane\"—this refers to the crane born of the womb, not the feathered crane of Penglai, nor the cinnabar-crested crane of Purple Tenuity that cries to the heavens. It is neither the white-robed dancer of the Jasper Terrace nor the white-garbed whistler of the Celestial Pivot. How could Pure Yang Perfected Lord Lü’s crane be merely a fleeting apparition?\n\nWhen cranes come, they soar through autumn’s clear skies and cry to the deep night’s moon. Immortals who ride cranes come and go—truly, those who attain the Dao, refine the true, and transcend the dust may obtain this scripture and summon them with flying talismans. They will arrive in graceful flight, soaring through the heavens, not merely calling from the Nine Marshes.\n\n*Recorded by Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Dharma Master, Divine Empyrean Registrar, Commander of Thunder and Lightning Troops, Sea-Jade Realized Person Bai Yuchan.*\n\n**Lineage Masters:**\nMaster of the Vibrant Dao, Sovereign of All Immortals’ Teachings, Compassionate Savior of Huayang, Dao Lord of Longevity and World-Salvation, Immortal King of Azure Florescence, True Mysterious Numinous Response Heavenly Worthy Li Zhe.\nAncestral Master, Master of the Numinous True Teachings, Celestial Envoy of the Ninefold Golden Gate’s Immortal Selection, Supreme Clarity Wondrous Response Enlightenment and Dao-Transmitting Perfected Lord, Life-Protecting Controller of Destiny, Nation-Guarding Immortal King, Highest Primordial August Transformative Heavenly Worthy Zhongli Quan Yunfang.\nAncestral Master, Supreme Clarity Highest Realized Person, High Primordial Purple Void Pure True Primordial Lady Wei Huacun.\nAncestral Master, Master of the Upright True Teachings, Pure Yang Numinous Treasure Wondrous Penetration and Correct Transformation Perfected Lord Lü Yan Dongbin.\nAncestral Master, Master of the Illuminated True Teachings, Sea-Toad Enlightened Comprehension and Dao-Propagating Perfected Lord Liu Xuanying.\n\nAncestral Master, Master of the Mysterious True Teachings, Heavenly Terrace Purple Yang Enlightened Realization and Wondrous Being Perfect Penetration Perfected Lord Zhang Yongcheng.\nAncestral Master, Emerald Mystery Dao-Propagating Apricot Grove Realized Person Shi Taidezhi.\nAncestral Master, Purple Worthiness Life-Restoring Piling Realized Person Xue Daoguang.\nAncestral Master, Emerald Void Universal Salvation Mud-Pill Realized Person Chen Nan.\nPatriarch, Purple Clarity Samādhi-Prajñā Sea-Jade Perfected Person Bai Yuchan.\n\nSummon the Directing Talismanic Officers:\nBurn incense and invoke the Year-Directing Xunuo He, the Day-Directing Bojiri, the Night-Watch Directing Star Sovereigns, and the Twenty-Eight Constellations’ Directing Talismanic Officers and Soldiers.

Now desiring to propagate the teachings and spread their influence, that the people may come to revere them and the Great Dao flourish, [I] humbly approach Your August Marchmount to request the loan of several simurghs and cranes. On such-and-such a day at noon, may they descend to the ritual altar, circling and dancing above and below, offering obeisance with bowed heads and bared forms. When the noon audience concludes, may they be immediately dispatched back to their posts, without daring to linger.\n\nFurthermore, [I] beseech the dispatch of the Blue-Green Controller of Cranes, the spirit officer of Penglai, to attend the altar and witness the covenant of the fast. This petition is hereby respectfully submitted.\n\n[Your] humble servant, [Name], most reverently presents this petition before the Sacred Thearch of the Southern Marchmount, Controller of Heaven’s Luminous Might. May Your Sagely Compassion deign to grant this earnest plea. Issue commands to the master of the Simurgh-and-Crane Bureau to promptly act in accordance with the matters herein submitted, swiftly dispatching them to ensure the ritual’s completion, transforming both humans and celestials, and perfecting the fast in all its aspects.\n\n[I], [Name], presuming upon Your Sacred Authority, am filled with trembling awe. Respectfully submitted.\n\nIn the year of ___, the ___ month, the ___ day, [Name], of such-and-such position, submits this petition.\n\nSubmitted to the Master of the Simurgh-and-Crane Bureau of Penglai Mountain, the Perfected Lord of the Day.\n\nOn the day following the ritual, a second missive shall be sent, dispatching the Perfected Officer of the current stellar lodge, along with the Directing Talisman, and the Intermediary Director of Merit-Officials, to urgently summon twelve, twenty-four, or thirty-six simurghs and cranes, as well as one spirit officer, to attend the altar. Issue the summons again.\n\nThe Seven Spirit Officers of Penglai Mountain Who Control Cranes:\nFirst Spirit Officer: Radiant Rosy Clouds\nSecond Spirit Officer: Jade Radiance\nThird Spirit Officer: Golden Fusion\nFourth Spirit Officer: Bian Wen\nFifth Spirit Officer: Treasure Radiance\nSixth Spirit Officer: Qi Yang\nSeventh Spirit Officer: Elegant Fruit\n\nThese seven spirit officers take turns beginning on the first day of each month. However, on the last day of the lunar month and the full-moon day, the spirit officer named Vermilion Lake does not fall under their jurisdiction and will not respond to summons. Only during the Nine-Yin Yellow Register Grand Offering to the Boundless Heavens will he arrive promptly. At other times, if summoned in jest or frivolity, the invocation will prove ineffective.\n\nThis method was taught by the Patriarchal Iron-Crutch Perfected Lord of All Immortals, the August Thearch of the East, who, atop Mount Qingcheng, assembled the host of immortals and summoned cranes from the Southern Marchmount, which arrived riding the void. When the affair concluded, they returned. The teaching was later transmitted to Zhongli, the Perfected Lord of Upright Yang, and to the Purple Void Perfected Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount. It was then passed to Lord Lü Dongbin, the Perfected Lord of Pure Yang, who transmitted it to the Immortal Liu Haichan. He, in turn, bestowed it upon the Purple Yang Perfected Lord Zhang of Mount Tiantai. From generation to generation, it has been transmitted thus, reaching the ninth-generation lineage-holding immortal master, the Jade Tube Immortal Elder, through whom it has spread unbroken to the present day.\n\nIn the final days of the jiachen year, I unexpectedly had the good fortune to attend a gathering at the Treasure Canopy Grotto of Wuyang, where I served with wholehearted devotion. On the celestial腊 day of the yisi year, I presented this petition with incense, prostrated myself, and entreated my master to accept me as a disciple, to enlighten me on the firing times of the golden elixir’s transformations. From that moment, the secret transmission resonated within me, and all proved true. Thus, I reflect that my master’s kindness towers higher than Mount Sumeru and runs deeper than the vast sea; though I were to grind my bones to powder, I could never repay such virtue.\n\nDid not my master say: “Diligence without encounter leads one to meet a perfected being; encounter without diligence consigns one to become a lowly ghost.” Day and night, through the twelve double-hours, I never forget this admonition. Resolutely, I press forward, my resolve growing ever firmer, vowing to attain the pure, liberated, supreme, and perfectly true Great Dao. Thereby may I deliver my primal ancestors, my three masters and dharma friends, and all karmically connected kin through countless kalpas, universally extending to all beings throughout the dharma realm, that together we may ascend to the joys of the immortals’ realm. How could I dare let this life slip by in vain?\n\nTime passes swiftly, and after several years, I unexpectedly obtained the immortal master’s book on summoning cranes—was this mere chance? Twice, thrice, I prostrated myself upon the earth, paying homage to the patriarchal and immortal masters, and was deemed worthy of receiving their transmission. Thus empowered, I may practice and uphold it, revering the immortal transformations and attaining fruition as a perfected being.\n\nThose who summon cranes must be cultivators of the true, bearers of registers, whose virtue extends to others, whose accumulated merits fill the heavens, whose beneficence nurtures the myriad people, who pray for timely rain and sunshine, who deliver the living and the dead, whose mysterious works are vast and profound, whose names are inscribed on the immortal ranks, and who hold offices of the first or second rank—only such may perform this rite. It is most efficacious.\n\nHowever, it must be conducted within the great karmic affinity of the Crane Assembly Fast of the Patriarchs, and only then may it be performed three days in advance. The appointed day and hour must be strictly observed for the invocation to prove effective. Those who are not of high rank, office, or virtue may not summon them.\n\nWhoever obtains this method must guard it carefully and not lightly disclose it. Those who do so will immediately incur heavenly retribution. How could one not be cautious? Keep it secret, keep it secret!\n\n**End of *Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls*, Scroll Fourteen**\n#1 *Method for Petitioning the Dipper to Seek Longevity*: Transmitted by the Southern Lineage of the Golden Elixir School during the Song and Yuan dynasties.\n#2 *Secret Method for Summoning the Crane*: Transmitted by the Southern Lineage of the Golden Elixir School during the Song and Yuan dynasties.\n\n**Beginning of *Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls*, Scroll Fifteen**\n*Protocol for the Conjoined Refinement Memorial Rite*\n\n**Incantation for Purifying the Mouth (Recited Upon Entering the Altar)**\nSpirit of the cinnabar mouth, expel filth and dispel miasma;\nSpirit of the tongue, rectify order, link life and nurture the spirit.\nSpirits of the thousand teeth, repel evil and guard the true.\nSpirit of the throat, Mighty Tiger, conducts qi and guides fluids.\nSpirit of the heart, Cinnabar Prime, enables my communion with the true.\nSpirit of thought refines the essence; the upright qi endures forever.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Incantation for Purifying the Body**\nNuminous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, pacify and comfort this bodily form.\nDisciples’ hun and po, five viscera in profound darkness:\nAzure Dragon brings auspicious fortune, White Tiger guards the form.\nVermilion Bird watches over, Dark Warrior gathers essence.\nBloody corpses and foul impurities, malevolent forces subside in concealment.\nSeven fluids flow aright; five viscera transform and generate.\nI uphold this divine incantation—*Primordial, Prosperous, Beneficent, Steadfast*.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Incantation for Purifying Heaven and Earth**\nWithin the cavern, emptiness and mystery; radiant and vast, the Great Prime.\nMighty spirits of the eight directions, render me natural.\nNuminous Treasure talismanic decree, universally proclaimed to the Nine Heavens.\n*Qianluo Danna*, Cavern Stem of the Great Mystery,\nSlay demons, bind evil, annihilate ten thousand ghosts.\nCentral Mountain divine incantation, Jade Text of the Primordial Beginning.\nRecite once to repel ghosts and prolong life;\nTraverse the Five Peaks, let the Eight Seas bear witness.\nDemon kings bow their heads, attending and guarding my chamber.\nMalevolent impurities dissolve and disperse; the Dao’s darkness endures forever.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Offering Incense and Presenting the Prayer**\nJade splendor scatters light; ninefold qi congeals as mist.\nFragrant clouds densely woven, ascend directly to the Nine Heavens.\nGolden Lad Attending Incense, Jade Maiden Transmitting Words,\nReceive and convey the fragrant smoke, ascending to the Emperor’s presence.\nLet the petitions I now present be granted in full, as spoken.\n\nThe officiant, the humble servant [Name], reverently kindles incense, prostrates twice, and respectfully addresses the Three Pristine Supreme Saints, the Ten Loftiest Perfected, the Nine Celestial Thrones of the Divine Empyrean, the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns, the Palace of the Sun’s Grand Yang Lord, the Mansion of the Moon’s Grand Yin Sovereign, the Great Sage of the Celestial Stem, the Star Lords of the Seasonal Nodes, the Nine Leaping Star Lords of Supreme Clarity, the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper’s Longevity Star Lords, the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper’s Deliverance Star Lords, the Three Terraces and Canopy Star Lords, the Twelve Palaces’ Hour Star Lords, the Twenty-Eight Constellations’ Star Lords, the Three Origins’ Three Ranks’ Three Officials’ Great Emperors, the Four Sagely Perfected of the Northern Culmen’s Dharma Lord, the Five Masters of the Mystery’s Teaching Lord, the Ancestral Master of Orthodox Unity’s Quiescent Response and Manifest Blessing Perfected Lord, the Left Palace Immortal Elder of the Supreme Ultimate, the Three Ministries of Thunder, the Nine Bureaus of Thunder, the Arrayed Lofty Perfected of the Purple Palace’s Gate, the Sagely Hosts of Thunder, the Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks and Five Mountains, the Great Emperor of Fengdu in the Earthly Prison, the Ten Palaces’ Perfected Lords of the Netherworld, the Great Emperor of Fusang in the Watery Palace, the attending thunder deities, officials, generals, and soldiers, and all true lords of the Three Realms and Ten Directions.\n\nMay the sagely compassion turn its numinous gaze upon me.

I have vowed to act as Heaven’s proxy in transforming the world, aiding the state and saving the people, conducting all practices to succor humanity and benefit all beings. In every supplication I offer, I humbly beseech the divine to grant its numinous response.\n\nI prostrate myself, praying that the Great Dao will bestow its compassion, that the myriad heavens will commend my devotion, that my reverent and earnest intent will be cherished, and my past errors and transgressions pardoned. May the Black Registers erase my faults, my immortal rank advance, my departed kin attain deliverance, and all my movements be secure. May the Dao’s qi sustain me, and its numinous radiance illumine me from above. May my body and mind attain purity, so that no evil may assail me. May governance be solemn and orderly, and the hundred spirits stand guard in solemn array. I rely upon the virtue of creation and sustenance, that it may accord with the sincerity of my heart.\n\nThe officiant bows his head, knocks his forehead to the ground, and prostrates twice in reverence.\n\nThen, facing east, he clicks his teeth and declares:\nThe humble servant respectfully addresses the Grand Yang Lord of the Sun Palace. May the sagely compassion permit my petition. May the true qi of the Grand Yang descend and pour into my body, expelling all perverse qi, severing the one hundred and four ailments. Where I gaze upon mountains, may they crumble; where I behold seas, may they dry. Where I regard illness, may it be cured; where I look upon people, may they live. May people take refuge, may ghosts be subdued, and may evil not encroach upon the upright.\n\nWith his left hand, he traces the mao trigram, visualizing above his left temple a sun within which stands a disheveled-headed general.

The Sixfold Union Palace lies one cun above the brow, where the sun returns to the left Sixfold Union.\n\nSecret incantation:\nSpirit of Yu Yi, true numen of the Li Palace.\nPour forth the nine rays, primordial, prosperous, advantageous, and steadfast.\n[Recited three times]\n\nUpon completing the incantation, he glances to the left side of his head, one chi and five cun away, where nine strands of luminous qi appear. He inhales them into his heart with his mouth.\n\nHe recites again:\nOṃ.\n\nOṃ *va-□-ra-hvī-ca-lī svāhā.*\n[Recited nine times]\n\nNext, he faces west and clicks his teeth, addressing above:\nYour servant humbly invokes the Supreme Yin Sovereign of the Moon Palace. May Your sagely compassion grant this petition: descend the Jade Radiance of the Supreme Yin, pouring black luminosity into this servant’s body, driving out perverse qi, severing the one hundred and four ailments. Where mountains are beheld, mountains crumble; where seas are seen, seas run dry; where illness is observed, illness is cured; where people are regarded, people flourish. People take refuge; ghosts are subdued and banished; the perverse do not encroach upon the upright.\n\nWith his right hand, he traces the you trigram, visualizing above his right temple a moon within which stands a Jade Maiden, holding a ritual scepter. The qi of ten rays, like ten strands, descends and pours in, entering through the Sixfold Union Palace of the right side, illuminating body and mind.\n\nNext, the secret incantation:\nSpirit of Jielin, true essence of the Kan Palace.\nRound and radiant, ten rays—auspicious, advantageous, and primally flourishing.\n[Recited three times]\n\nUpon completing the incantation, he glances to the right side of his head, one chi and five cun away, where ten strands of luminous qi appear. He inhales them into his heart with his mouth.\n\nHe recites again:\nOṃ.\n\nOṃ vaṃ raḥ raḥ svāhā. [Recited ten times]\n\nNext, facing south, he knocks his teeth and addresses the heavens:\nYour servant humbly invokes the Great Sage Star Lord of the Celestial Stem. May Your sagely compassion grant this petition: descend with the golden light of upright qi, pour it into this servant’s body, expel perverse qi, sever the one hundred and four ailments. Mountains crumble at the sight, seas dry at the gaze; the sick recover, the living thrive; people take refuge; ghosts are subdued and banished; the perverse do not encroach upon the upright.\n\nWith his left hand, he traces the chen trigram; with his right, he forms the sword mudra.\n\nNext, the secret incantation:\nChapter of Śakra Devānām Indra, girded with the Celestial Stem.\nThe malevolent ghosts of the five directions—\nwhy have they not vanished?\nWith a single inhalation of the flying immortal,\nten thousand ghosts hide in submission.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command.\n\nUpon completing the incantation, he visualizes the Celestial Stem standing in a yellow cloud above his head, clad in plain silk, hair unbound and feet bare, resembling Zhenwu, three-eyed, wielding the Fire Command Sword. From his central eye issues the qi of golden light, which he inhales through his mouth, feeling the golden light fill his mouth, then blows it to coil around his body.\n\nHe recites again:\nOṃ. Spirit of the imperial command, true numen of the Dipper’s Pole.\nSeven rays flow in radiance—hūṃ tṣaḥ [sound lost].\n\nUpon completing the incantation, he closes his mouth, steadies his breath, and fixes his gaze.\n\nThe secret incantation:\nGreat Sage of the Celestial Stem, foremost star of the Northern Dipper,\ngolden light of upright qi—\npour into my form.\nDemons are all purged;\nthe body attains longevity.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command.\n\nUpon completing the incantation, he inhales the qi of the Heavenly Gate and blows it onto the gen trigram, then traces the yin trigram.\n\nThe secret incantation:\nOṃ.\n\nHūṃ hūṃ tát lì suō hē chì shè. Seven times. Upon completing the incantation, from the *yín* trigram he traces upward to the *chén* position, then flicks outward, visualizing the central eye of the Celestial Stem emitting golden light, which pours down to suffuse his body and heart.\n\nNext, he retreats a step, taps his teeth three times, and forms the *biànshén* mudra with both hands—left at the *chén* position, right at the *yǒu* position—then rests them at his waist. First, he visualizes his body as withered wood, pinches the *wǔ* position with both hands, inhales a mouthful of southern *qi*, and blends it with his heart’s *qi* to form true fire. Flicking the *wǔ* position, he ignites the fire at the wood’s roots, burning upward all at once. Next, he pinches the *sì* position, summoning the *xùn* wind to scatter the ashes, leaving no trace of dust or shadow.\n\nHe visualizes an infant within his cinnabar field gradually growing, hair unbound and feet bare, clad in a black robe and golden armor, appearing like the True Warrior. Beneath his feet, a dark turtle exhales *qi*; pinching the *zǐ* position, the turtle’s head stirs. The *qi* merges with his kidney *qi*. A red serpent exhales *qi*, merging with his heart *qi*; pinching the *wǔ* position, the serpent’s head stirs. The Northern Dipper enshrouds his body, the Three Terraces stand before him, a sun to his left and a moon to his right. The Celestial Stem hovers above his head, a mighty warrior holding a seven-starred black banner to his left, another mighty warrior bearing a sword case to his right. A circular image crowns his head, its radiance illuminating heaven and earth. Generals and officials stand in solemn array. His left hand forms the Northern Emperor’s mudra, the middle finger pinching the center of the thumb, while his right hand forms the sword mudra.\n\nThe secret incantation:\nBy the law of heaven, numinous and divine,\nGreat Spirit of the Dark Warrior.\nTreading upon the coiling serpent,\ncrowned with the seven stars.\nWielding the divine sword,\ngaze fixed upon the Heavenly Gate.\nMight pervades heaven and earth,\nenthroned at the Northern Asterism.\nMountain sprites and wayward ghosts\nvanish a thousand leagues away.\nGrasping the celestial prison,\nGreat Spirit of the Heavenly Armor,\nswiftly descend beneath the altar,\ninterrogate the nameless.\nWhere the heavenly records arrive,\nforever sever the demonic essence.\nDeliver the people from suffering,\nbestow great might and numen.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command.\n\nVisualizing the spirits in practice:\nThe Three Hun return to the liver. The liver resides on the left; pinch the *mǎo* position. Visualize three Daoists atop the left side of his head, clad in azure robes, blown by the eastern blue *qi*. They enter from the left Six Harmonies, descend from the upper palate, and he receives them with his tongue, guiding them past the Twelve-Storied Tower to lodge within the liver’s three lobes, like an azure lapis lazuli palace.\n\nThe Seven Po return to the lungs. The lungs reside in the center; pinch the *yǒu* position. Visualize seven stars atop the right side of his head, each containing seven Daoists in plain white robes, blown by the western white *qi*. They descend behind the brain, down the spine, spiraling into the shoulder well, passing through the Twelve-Storied Tower to enter the lungs, standing within the jade palace.\n\nWisdom returns to the spleen; pinch the center of the middle finger. Visualize a monkey and a horse, suffused by the golden light *qi*. They descend from the center of the forehead, passing the Twelve-Storied Tower and the stomach’s entrance, where a golden child sprays water. The monkey and horse, drenched, transform into a golden lion, which he rides downward into the spleen. The monkey is devoured by a *ní* beast, the horse becomes a *bó* steed, and the *ní* stands atop the *bó*, both entering the spleen, which he visualizes as a golden chamber.\n\nEssence returns to the kidneys; pinch the *zǐ* position. Visualize two kidneys along the spine, fuzzy like the sun and moon, the left *qi* with nine strands, the right *qi* with ten rays, piercing straight through the crown to the Parents’ Palace—the Mud Pill Palace. There, he sees the Parents’ Palace’s purple *qi* descending in nine strands from the left; he taps his teeth and calls: \"Grand Unity Lord,\" three times. It flows directly into the kidneys. He calls: \"Peach Health Lord,\" three times. He sees a figure like himself entering the left kidney palace, black clouds dispersing, revealing a clear blue sky and bright sun. Again, he visualizes the Parents’ Palace’s purple *qi* descending in ten rays from the right; he taps his teeth and calls: \"Director of Destinies Lord,\" three times. It flows directly into the kidneys. He calls: \"Union and Extension Lord,\" three times. He sees a woman-like figure entering the right kidney palace, black clouds retreating, revealing a clear blue sky and bright sun. He visualizes a pool of water within the cinnabar field congealing into ice-jade, solid and unmoving, illuminated by the sun and moon’s radiance from the kidneys. Pinch the *zǐ* position.\n\nThe spirit returns to the heart; pinch the *wǔ* position. Visualize the True Warrior’s form within the cinnabar field, identical to his own, summoning the spirits of his entire body.\n\nThe secret incantation:\nMay the ten thousand spirits unite with my heart.\nSeven times.\n\nSoon, he sees the ten thousand spirits, all like stars, countless in number, ascending into the golden tower and jade chamber. He visualizes his heart like a great fire pearl, celestial flames blazing. The fire pearl holds a dewdrop in its mouth, which drips onto the true person’s body, drawing all the spirits to enter through his mouth into the pearl’s inner tower, where they recite scriptures.\n\nThe secret incantation:\nCinnabar Origin, Cinnabar Palace,\nmerge with the hundred spirits.\nThree times; pinch the *wǔ* position.\n\nManifesting the Four Numinous Beasts:\nThe Azure Dragon, Mèngzhāng; pinch *yín*, *jiǎ-yín*. Visualize the liver’s blue *qi* emerging from the left eye as an azure dragon, attending to his left. The Azure Dragon Lord holds a dragon banner in one hand and wields a sword in the other, standing beside the azure dragon.\n\nThe White Tiger, Jiānbīng; pinch the *shēn* position and *jiǎ-shēn*.\n\nHe visualizes the white *qi* within his lungs emerging from his nose as a white tiger, attending to his right. The White Tiger Lord wields a sword in one hand and holds a tiger banner in the other, standing beside the white tiger.\n\nAbove, the Vermilion Phoenix of Numinous Radiance; pinch the *wǔ* position and *jiǎ-wǔ*. He visualizes the red *qi* within his heart emerging from his mouth as a vermilion phoenix, spitting fire from its beak and flapping its wings above his head.\n\nBelow, the Dark Warrior Holding Brightness; pinch the *zǐ* position and *jiǎ-zǐ*. He visualizes the black *qi* within his kidneys emerging from his left ear as the Dark Warrior, stationed behind him.\n\nHe visualizes a lion emerging from below his navel, roaring before him. Two white cranes emerge from the Six Harmonies Palace, flying in crossing patterns above his shoulders. His hands move from *xū* to *chén*.\n\nSecret incantation:\n□□□□□□□.\nCelestial spirits flourish in their nodes,\nmay they guard my long life.\nThe Supreme Mystery’s One,\nprotects the true form.\nThe spirit lords of the five viscera,\neach ensure peace and tranquility.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.\n\nThe Three Terraces give me birth at *sì*; the Three Terraces nurture me at *wǔ*; the Three Terraces protect me at *wèi*. Next, pinch the Dipper and recite:\nThe stalwart *kuí* and *gāng* of *chén* and *xū* enter the Central Palace to seize.\nThe *kuí* and *gāng* of *chén* and *xū* enter the Central Palace to seize.\n*Jiǎ-chén* and *jiǎ-xū* enter the Central Palace.\n\nNext recite:\nHeaven shines bright, earth spirits glow.\nI am the summoning envoy,\nborn before heaven and earth.\nI act as heaven and earth’s messenger,\nstanding as heaven and earth’s sentinel.\nDisasters and harm meet self-destruction,\nfortune and blessings arise of themselves.\nNot only do I restrain tigers and wolves,\nI can also shatter the five weapons.\nDivine dragons dare not display their power,\nspirit ghosts dare not exercise their numen.\nPoint at mountains and they crumble,\npoint at seas and they dry up,\npoint at stones and they split,\npoint at sun and moon and they shine together.\nWherever I walk, sit, lie, or stand,\nten thousand soldiers always follow.\nWherever my hand points,\nwind, fire, lightning, and radiance arise.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.\n\nThe incantation complete, cross his hands, pinch the Yin-Yang Dipper, and flick upward. He visualizes the altar suffused with resplendent golden light, illuminating the ten directions.\n\nIncantation:\nThe Northern Dipper lofty and proud,\nthe Dipper’s handle radiates might.\nStrike mountains and they split,\nstrike seas and they dry up.\nMalevolent spirits and evil ghosts,\nwho dares stand before me?\nThose who follow the *gāng* live,\nthose who oppose it perish.\nWherever my body goes,\nmisfortune is forever severed.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.\n\nStanding evenly, he knocks his teeth together three times.

Then, with the previously heated needle, pierce the child’s middle joint to a depth of two *fen*, withdraw it, and observe the drop of toxic fluid that emerges. If it clings to the hand with a thread-like strand, watery and red in hue, it is female; if white, it is male. Take a five-colored thread, roughly three *chi* in length, and pass it through the incense burner’s smoke. Visualize the Fire-Bell General amidst flames above, bell in left hand and fire-rope in right. Envision the general casting down the five-colored thread, which transforms into an iron chain. After a moment, encircle the child’s neck with the chain and bind it securely, beginning the knot at the child’s *gu men*. Next, burn the aforementioned talisman and place nine moxa cones upon the handprint in the ash, specifically at the middle joint of the middle finger where the imprint was made. Light a sesame oil lamp and apply seven moxa cauterizations.

Then recite the incantation:\n\nThe primal destiny descends and gathers\nA hundred essences refine the true\nGreat spirits align in harmony\nManifesting my divine presence\nExhaling clouds and seizing mists\nInstantly arriving at the Golden Perfected\nThe Terrace’s light shatters all\nThe Flying Dipper conceals the body\nThe Five Thunder Envoys\nAttend and guard with reverence\nSwiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands ordain!\n\nNext, step to Wu Qu and recite the incantation:\n\nThe five viscera and six bowels\nTransform through divine radiance\nSpiritual perfected enter and exit\nUnobstructed and uncoagulated\nThunder Lords attend as guards\nVisualize the Five Thunder Envoys at my left and right—demons and ghosts flee in concealment\nDivine transformation knows no bounds\nYellow clouds envelop the body\nVisualize the *qi* from the spleen ascending and coalescing into yellow clouds covering the body, with thunderous radiance and flying fire.

Enter the oratory and avoid worldly affairs.\nEach day, employ the Heart Petition Talisman, the Great Peace Talisman, and the Petition-Subduing Talisman, facing the auspicious direction and swallowing them with pure water.\nWhen ingesting, hold the talisman in the mouth, press the tongue against the upper palate, and tilt the face to gaze eastward. Inhale the blue *qi* from the nose into the mouth and visualize it.\nNext, gaze upward to the heavens and inhale the red *qi* through the nose into the mouth.\nThen, look downward to the earth and inhale the yellow *qi* from the ground through the nose into the mouth.\nVisualize the three colored *qi* blending in the mouth, forming a single luminous sphere, radiant as the sun.\nEnvision the talisman within this light, then swallow it with water. Perform this daily for talisman ingestion.\n\nNext, recite the Petition-Transmitting Incantation:\n\nSpirit within the heart,\nLord of the Cinnabar Origin,\nThree inches in length,\nSeven *fen* in breadth,\nClad in vermilion robes,\nGirded with crimson skirts.\nRiding majesty and virtue,\nManifesting supreme numinosity,\nCommuning with transformations,\nReaching the utmost truth.\nDwell within the heart,\nNever leave the body.\nIf urgent matters arise,\nHasten to report.\nNow, with this heart petition,\nHumbly request response.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands ordain!\n\n**Heart Petition Talisman**\nThis talisman is the petition’s secret—inscribed in cinnabar on a square inch of yellow paper, burned, and prepared with well water according to the method.

Use approximately two *sheng* of pure ash, stored in a clean vessel. Set up a spirit tablet, inscribing it: *Immortal Assembly of the Purple Maidens of Penglai*. Sweep and purify the chamber, placing the three items within. Perform morning and evening offerings with utmost purity.\n\nWhen making a petition, spread the ash upon the table’s surface. Bring the basket near, and the officiant burns the talisman while reciting the invocation. Upon completion, have a virtuous and refined person stand as the guest, while the officiant stands as the host, each lightly supporting the basket with empty hands, flanking the table. The chopstick will prick the ash—when the immortal arrives, the basket stirs, or writes the character *zhi* (至, \"arrival\"), or *jiang* (降, \"descent\"), or the name and title of the descending immortal. Offer libations as the heart dictates, and present the petition’s intent. Whether seeking to resolve abstruse meanings in scriptures, compose literature, inquire into secrets, attain perfection, divine fate, arrange marriages, or assess the *fengshui* of dwellings or graves, all may be spiritually communicated. Illustrious worthies of former ages—such as the Banished Immortal of Fragrant Mountain or Dongpo of West Lake—have occasionally descended, their words beyond mere counsel. When the writing fills the space, transcribe it, then sweep the ash smooth to continue. If the initial invocation fails to summon, do not resent or profane it; persist in repeated entreaties, and the spirit will be moved to descend without fail. With years of practice, the basket may be suspended by a cord, unsupported by hands, or the chopstick replaced with a brush to write upon paper—all depends on the matter at hand.\n\nWhen the immortal descends, hasten to bow; delay but slightly, and they depart.\n\nRecite the **Water Spell for Purification**:\n*\"Heaven generates water with the One; Earth completes it with the Six.\nOne and Six unite, and the Five Phases are founded.\nI now command the sprinkling to cleanse—filth flees like flying dust.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!\"*\nUpon finishing, sprinkle the water to purify the chamber.\n\nNext, light incense at the stove, face east, and knock the teeth together while silently praying:\n*\"I, [Name], bow my head and prostrate myself twice, reverently invoking the Primordial Lady of the Nine Heavens. Today, in accordance with the true precepts, I inscribe the numinous talisman to summon the Immortal Assembly of Penglai. May the true qi of the upright and authentic descend from afar to irrigate my body and heart, as well as the brush, ink, paper, and silk I employ. Let my writing of the talisman swiftly achieve spiritual communion. My humble devotion knows no limit in this earnest prayer. So be it.\"*\n\nNext, silently recite the **Paper Spell**:\n*\"Essence of the paper mulberry, born before Heaven and Earth.\nDragon scripts and phoenix seals, drawn forth to manifest.\nThe talisman flies with swiftness, traversing the celestial realms.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nNext, silently recite the **Ink Spell**:\n*\"Divine ink, numinous and bright, bridging the hidden and the luminous.\nThe Pine Lord fulfills his duty; the Orchid Companion gathers fragrance.\nImmortal perfected ones descend in haste, riding cloud chariots.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nNext, silently recite the **Brush Spell**:\n*\"The divine brush soars, its fame enduring through ten thousand ages.\nNow I inscribe the talisman to summon the ten directions.\nCloud chariots swiftly descend to the numinous precinct.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nAfter each spell, the ritual master concentrates the spirit, visualizes, and draws qi to blow upon the brush before inscribing the talisman.\n\n**Talisman for Descending Immortals** (inscribed in ink on yellow paper)\n\n**Talisman Invocation:**\n*\"Supreme Unity’s numinous yang, radiant with purple qi.\nThe halls are adorned with solemnity, the chambers filled with refinement.\nPurple Maiden, Purple Maiden—true scholar of the grotto-heavens.\nCloud tresses and rosy sashes, skin like ice and jade.\nKnowing human fortune and misfortune, able to compose poetry and prose.\nOnce Lady Cao departs, the Purple Maiden sets forth.\nMay she swiftly arrange her chariot and briefly descend upon the cloud thoroughfare.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nOnce the above invocation is complete, place the talisman upon the planchette, burn incense, and strike the teeth together while reciting the following prayer of intent:\n\n*\"By command of the talisman-officers of the Three Realms’ immortal courts, I hereby dispatch this mandate of the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Maiden, directing it straightaway to the Three Isles and Ten Continents, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands, and all the palaces and courts of the immortals. Humbly I invoke the Primordial True Jade-Skin Plain Maiden, the Three Rivers and Great Lake’s Snow-Reflecting Jade Perfected, the Jade-Axle Dao Elder, the Immortal Maidens Cloud Sister, Cassia Blossom, Celebration Slave, Snow Slave, Chief Slave True Minister—all the immortals of heaven above, earth below, the watery palaces, and the yang world, from ancient times to the present. By this summons, may all universally deign to descend. Prostrate, I beseech that for the sake of this petition, you mount crane and phoenix, ride cloud and mist, briefly depart your grotto-palaces, and descend to the dusty realm. May the numen beneath the planchette manifest, and the inward bond be duly fulfilled—my heartfelt devotion knows no limit in its yearning.\"*\n\nNext, hold the talisman-mandate over the candle flame and burn it. Blow the ashes to scatter them, then gaze toward the east, strike the teeth together, draw in a mouthful of *qi*, and blow it upon the planchette. Lift the planchette and rest it upon the table; if it moves, the immortal has arrived. Should it remain still, continue holding the planchette, strike the teeth again, and recite the spell:\n\n*\"Between heaven and earth, clouds and waters stretch afar.\nDare I beseech the immortal youths to array their retinue and welcome?\nWith rainbow banners and feathered canopies, descend from the cloudy empyrean.\nLet no delay linger, lest heart darken and soul dissolve.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nAfter the spell, envision the immortal’s descent and offer libations as you see fit. Then recite the secret incantation:\n\n*\"Clouds gather, mists disperse—\nthe perfected immortals arrive in an instant.\nMay they attach to the spirit-planchette,\nand with joyful sincerity, reveal their will.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nOnce the spell is complete, make your petition as the matter requires. If a \"depart\" character appears, the immortal wishes to leave. Lower the spirit-planchette at once, then burn incense and offer thanks, saying:\n\n*\"Immortals of all heavens and earth, grotto-palace hosts—\nthough just now summoned, you graciously descended to the dusty realm.\nYet the world’s bustle allows no long stay;\nwith fragrant incense, I reverently escort your chariot’s departure.\nShould future prayers arise, I shall again humbly invoke your presence.\"*\n\nWhen finished, strike the teeth once more and recite the spell:\n\nNo path remains unpassed, yet the path of departure is hard to find.\nWithin the four seas, who echoes this sound?\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.\n\n**Urgent Memorial to the Mysterious Heaven’s Sacred Text**\n\nFor all ritual proceedings, first purify defilements, transform the spirit, and visualize the Four Numinous Beasts guarding the body. Then trace the Yin-Yang Dipper, form the *sha* mudra with the left hand and the sword mudra with the right, gather the golden-light *qi*, and secretly recite the Summoning Generals Spell:\n\n*\"Essence of Mysterious Heaven, called Direct and Mighty Spirit.\nBy the Marshal’s command, descend swiftly in power.\nStand before the altar, heed the orders and act.\"*\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor’s statutes command.\n\n*\"Spirits of Heaven and Earth, transform into your essence.\nQian’s primal harmony, sun, moon, and five stars—\nFour Direct Messengers, descend with haste.\nArrive swiftly beneath the altar, report and respond in numinous communion.\"*\nSwiftly, swiftly, as Mysterious Heavenly Emperor’s statutes command.\n\nMysterious Heaven decrees: summon the Four Direct Messengers—Chen An, Liu Ji, Sun De, and Zhang Bing—descend in haste.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.\n\nRecite the above spell thrice. Then visualize *qi* of the four directions—azure, red, white, and black—converging above the incense like a mass of colored clouds, shimmering with golden radiance. The adept inhales this into the Kidney Palace, courses it through the Liver, up to the Heart, and into the Lungs, then exhales with the sounds *chui*, *xi*, *xu*, and *he* over the incense burner. Visualize golden light bursting forth, revealing the Four Direct Messengers in their directional robes, riding the golden light before the altar. Burn incense again and state your intent.\n\nWhen finished, the adept holds the memorial in hand, silently recites the middle section once, and directs golden light to blow upon the document, imagining an eight-cornered golden radiance enveloping it. Then silently recite the spell thrice more, visualizing all marshals and generals escorting the memorial. Pass it through the incense smoke, and the adept declares:\n\n*\"Open the Gate of Heaven.\"*\nPress the tongue to the upper palate and form the *hai* mudra.\n\n*\"Seal the Door of Earth.\"*\nPress the tongue to the jade floor and form the *si* mudra externally.\n\n*\"Hold the Human Gate.\"*\nBlink both eyes and form the *shen* mudra.\n\n*\"Block the Ghost Road.\"*\nHold the breath, stand in *ding* stance, and form the *yin* mudra.\n\nWhen complete, recite the spell again:\n*\"By Mysterious Heaven’s edict, the Four Direct Messengers all obey.\nActing on Heaven’s behalf, they universally succor the multitudes.\nFor the people’s afflictions and matters of urgent passion,\nthis brief memorial is swiftly presented to reach the Perfected.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.\"*\n\nWhen the spell concludes, burn incense and invite the officers. Next, read the memorial document, then offer paper money. Wrap the memorial in a talisman and cast it into the brazier to burn.\n\nThen recite the Dispatching Memorial Spell:\n*\"Smoke of five colors, surge upward to Heaven with the memorial.\nQi of five colors, ascend with the memorial to the Emperor.\nOld qi of the lower palaces must not recklessly interfere.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.\"*\n\nWhen the above spell concludes, the master visualizes clouds of five colors surging forth. The adept sits upright, imagining a mass of red light within the Heart. With the left hand, trace the Dipper, then visualize the red light rising from it. Following the mudra, flick it directly toward the Gate of Heaven, spanning ten thousand miles in an instant. Visualize the Four Generals at the front, bearing the memorial, while the adept’s spirit hosts lead the assembled generals, ascending with the red light.\n\nAfter a long while, a long bridge appears, radiant with dazzling light. After another long while, ascend the Twelve-Storied Tower, then cross the Crimson Bridge to reach the Jade Palace of the Central Heaven. Purple clouds drape overhead, and the officers and generals wait outside the palace gates. The adept and the Four Direct Messengers enter the palace, turn left into the Hall of Blessing and Sagacity. The gates are majestic, surrounded by myriad spirits.\n\nVisualize the Four Direct Messengers presenting the memorial to the Memorial-Receiving Perfected Officer. Prostrate nine times before the throne, then rise and ascend the left steps to the hall. Kneel before the desk to present the matter. Visualize the Perfected Officer receiving the memorial, and the Mysterious Emperor granting the petition. Bow again, descend the right steps, and prostrate nine times before the throne to give thanks. Exit the palace gates, where the Four Direct Messengers lead the way, followed by the officers and generals. Depart the Jade Palace, retrace the path, and suddenly return before the altar. Gather the red light into the Heart, strike the teeth, and swallow saliva thrice.\n\nThen pray:\n*\"The Four Direct Messengers and Merit Officers, who have just now guided this audience—now that the court visit is complete, I humbly request that each return to your respective domains. Should future summons arise, proceed as before.\"*\n\n**Swift Mudra**\nCalm the mind and silently visualize the original spirit in the Crimson Palace. Then summon the Four Direct Messengers to descend from the Brain Palace. When the ritual is complete, burn the memorial. Visualize the Four Direct Messengers bearing the memorial, leading the original spirit as they ascend in red light to the Brain Palace’s hall. Within the golden light, the Mysterious Emperor sits, surrounded by a forest of attendants. The adept kneels to present the matter orally, while the Four Direct Messengers submit the memorial. The Sage’s will grants the petition. Bow in thanks and return to the Crimson Palace.\n\nSilently recite the Heart Spell:\n*\"Om.\"*\n\n**\"Oṃ dhātu dhātu sarva-dhātu svāhā. Namo phaṭ. Svāhā.\"**\n\nUpon completing the right-hand spell, settle into stillness and await the response. Observe whatever vision appears, and interpret it according to the circumstance. This method must not be employed for trivial matters.\n\n**Daily Audience Rite**\nEach day at dawn or in the quiet of night, sit upright, knock the teeth twenty-four times, swallow saliva twenty-four times, and recite the Mysterious Emperor’s full title thrice. Visualize a point of radiance between the kidneys, rising through the spine to the back of the brain, reaching the Mud Pill Palace. See golden light shimmering, and silently intone *\"Golden Portal Transformation-Body Heavenly Worthy\"* twenty-one times. Soon the light scatters, suffusing the ten directions, revealing the Mysterious Emperor enthroned upon the Jade Mountain’s capital—this is the Mud Pill Palace—while your own form stands as a mountain before him, distinct and clear.\n\nNext, visualize the Four Direct Messengers emerging: from the heart through the left eye, from the liver through the right eye, and from the lungs and kidneys through the two ear roots. They stand in the clouds, bowing in attendance. Your own body assumes the aspect of a perfected being, emerging from the Yellow Court with a jade tablet to present your petition, kneeling in reverence. When the audience concludes, visualize the golden light reconverging as before. You return to the Crimson Palace, gazing down at the radiance between the kidneys until profound stillness is achieved—this marks the ritual’s completion.\n\nWhen subduing malevolent spirits, visualize the Mysterious Emperor with unbound hair and bare feet, his holy countenance wrathful, divine soldiers arrayed in formation, his presence awe-inspiring. For ordinary invocations, envision his holy countenance joyful. When seeking deliverance from misfortune, visualize his holy countenance compassionate.\n\n**Summoning the Four Direct Messengers Spell**\nThe numinous void’s five *qi*, one *qi* divides into forms.\nFrom the Great Beginning’s primordial chaos, extending to the darkest depths,\nEncompassing the six directions, universally planting the divine spirits.\nA thousand transformations, ten thousand changes—one *qi* divides all.\nAll spirits assemble, commanding officers and soldiers.\nSeize rebellious ghosts, capture and bind demonic entities.\nFour Direct Messengers, true forms of water and fire,\nHear my summons and swiftly descend.\nWith fetters and cudgels, with capture and restraint,\nI stand before the altar, awaiting your response.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*\n\n**Four Direct Messengers’ Demon-Subduing Talisman**\n\n**The Unity of Heaven and Earth’s Virtue, the Union of Sun and Moon’s Radiance**\n\nThe Dark Heaven Supreme Emperor commands the myriad spirits:\nYear-Directing General, Month-Directing General, Day-Directing General,\nHour-Directing General, Heaven’s Barrier General, Earth’s Pivot General,\nSix Jia Generals—hasten on rushing clouds,\nSix Ding Generals—advance with fiery urgency,\nHeaven-Slaughtering, Earth-Slaughtering, Year-Slaughtering, Month-Slaughtering,\nDay-Slaughtering, Hour-Slaughtering, Three Origins Slaughtering Ghost Generals,\nDisheveled-Head General—seize the ghosts swiftly,\nYellow-Head General—bind the ghosts swiftly,\nPrison-Head General—behead the ghosts swiftly.\n\n**Summoning Spell**\nDark Heaven Supreme Emperor, numinous spirit of *ren* and *gui*,\nTransforming body in the Golden Palace, commanding the divine soldiers.\nMajestic presence resplendent, stellar essences arrayed in brilliance.\nThunder roars and lightning flashes, beheading and slaying demonic entities.\nThe colossal serpent’s might, the divine tortoise’s awe.\nSix Ding and Six Jia, Eight Slaughtering Generals,\nFour Direct Messengers, Black Slaughtering Numinous Spirits.\nShaking heaven and earth, banners and ranks in tumultuous array.\nAt the summons, descend at once, spreading dread and might.\nThe deities of the Nine Provinces’ earth-altars, blood-offering spirits—\nShould any dare resist, shatter their forms to dust.\nWith one descent of the divine talisman, the ten directions are purified.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*\n\nThe talisman is inscribed on yellow paper in black ink. Seal the Slaughtering Script, draw in northern *qi*, and press the True Martial Seal. Visualize oneself as the Dark Emperor, commanding the Four Generals to lead troops from the north, riding black clouds into the talisman. To dispel malevolent forces, summon the generals and fumigate or ingest the talisman. For routine exorcisms and disaster resolution, it may be employed as needed.\n\n**Four Direct Messengers’ Credential Talisman**\nRecite the full sacred title of the Jade Emperor, press the Jade Script, and draw in golden-light *qi* to infuse the talisman.\nSummon the Four Direct Messengers, Attendant Officers: Chen An, Wen Zi, Liu Jiwu, Wen Sun De, Zhang Bingyou.\nRecite: *By the Jade Emperor’s Supreme Decree, the Dark Emperor’s full sacred title is invoked to convey intent.*\nInscribe the talisman with the Dark Heaven Supreme Emperor’s command.\n\nVisualize the talisman within the golden light of Heaven’s Gate, descending the golden decree characters into it. Then envision golden radiance filling the eyes. First inscribe the character *huang* (皇) in black, followed by the names of the Four Direct Messengers. Press the Four Seals and anoint with the Dark Emperor’s title. Next, write the character *chi* (勑) in cinnabar, then inscribe *Xuanti Ling* (玄天令) three times as a seal. Anoint the talisman with the Jade Emperor’s title, fold it into an envelope, and employ it.\n\n**Tile Talisman**\nInscribe this talisman on yellow paper in cinnabar. Write the character *chi* (敕) with the Jade Emperor’s full title, then inscribe the talisman’s body with the Dark Emperor’s full title, anointing it with the title below. From Heaven’s Gate, let the secret characters descend into the talisman, beginning the stroke from the *hai* (亥) position.\n\nWhen burning the talisman, take a tile from the ridge of the afflicted household’s roof, wash it clean, and affix the talisman to it. On yang days, place the tile face-up; on yin days, face-down. Arrange paper money and horses on the talisman, place the envelope on the money and horses, and scatter five-colored petals over it. As it burns, visualize the smoke transforming into five-colored clouds swirling around the envelope, with the Four Direct Messengers bearing it aloft as they ascend.\n\n**Heavenly Script Talisman and Envelope**\nOn such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour, dispatched from such-and-such a place for such-and-such a matter, respectfully await a response on such-and-such a month, day, and hour, as per the master’s decree.\nYour servant [Name] respectfully submits.\n\nInscribe the talisman and incantation.\n\nAmidst layered voids, divine clouds resplendent shine,\nIn sapphire skies, the Brahma-net’s threads entwine.\nThe Primordial’s nine dragons draw the chariot bright,\nThe August One holds court in the azure light.\nA myriad perfected gather in the numinous glow,\nPearl-lit radiance unfolds where the sun’s rays flow.\nThe *Lingbao* scriptures now revealed on high,\nThrough virtue and power, blessings thereby nigh.\n\nIn cavernous mysteries, high peaks conceal,\nJade tones ripple forth on cloud-borne chimes’ peal.\nBoundless, beyond thought’s grasp, the Dao’s sea surges wide,\nIts waves in ceaseless motion, its depths untried.\nDharma’s meaning flows like rivulets pure,\nNurturing fine sprouts that shall endure.\nTo succor the destitute, the hungry relieve,\nAnd teach the court’s defense to upraise and weave.\nMay the August Emperor’s years stretch a hundred million long,\nWith peace prevailing, blades of war forever gone.\nBowing in reverence toward the Jade Celestial Throne,\nDivine blossoms scatter from quills of gold alone.\n*Haste, haste, in accordance with statute and decree!*\n\n**Talisman Instructions:**\nInscribe on yellow paper, five *cun* in diameter. Half in vermilion for the talisman, half in ink for the petition’s intent.\n\n**When inscribing talisman or petition:**\nFirst invoke the *Golden Portal’s Transfigured Heavenly Worthy*, then visualize the *Most High Lord Lao* seated above the petitioner’s crown. Recite the incantation while inscribing, envisioning paper, brush, ink, and inkstone all suffused with golden, Brahma-like *qi*.\n\n**For exorcising malevolent spirits or dismantling shrines:** Use black paper, ink inscription.\n**For dispelling misfortune or curing illness:** Use yellow paper, vermilion inscription.\n**For beseeching clear skies:** Use green paper, vermilion inscription.\n**For beseeching rain:** Use red paper, ink inscription.\n**For beseeching snow:** Use green paper, white powder inscription.\n\n**Short Petition Format:**\nOn yellow paper, five *cun* in height, seven *cun* in width. Write in compact script, affixing a small seal at the top.\n\n*Your subordinate, [Name], respectfully memorializes on behalf of [Person] for [Matter].*\n*With utmost urgency, this petition is humbly presented before the August Presence of the North Pole’s Mysterious Heavenly Sage Master, Perfected Warrior, True Martial Lord.*\n*May the Sagely Compassion deign to grant this plea and bestow [specific instructions for action].*\n\n**Short Petition Humbly Presented with Utmost Urgency**\n\n*Your subordinate respectfully submits this brief memorial, urgently presented for Your August Hearing.*\n\n*On the [Day] of the [Month] of the [Year] under the reign of the Great Year-Star, your subordinate [Name] urgently memorializes.*\n\n**Bound-Waist Format**\n*Your subordinate urgently memorializes with reverence.*\n\n**Seated Practice of the Mysterious Altar**\nVisualize oneself as undifferentiated chaos, like an egg in form. In an instant, water ascends and fire descends, uniting in the Central Palace, resembling a purple-red golden pellet.\nThen descend to the Cinnabar Field, passing from the Tailbone through the Spine’s Gate, crossing the Double Staircase to reach the Mud Pill, its hue like the rising sun.\nNext, flow downward to the Central Field, its hue like the sun at midday.\nThen descend to the Lower Cinnabar Field, its hue like the setting sun.\nThis is the ascent and descent of the Three Palaces.\nAgain ascend to the Mysterious Chamber, where the divine radiance shines brilliantly.\n\n**Incantation:**\nThe Perfected of the Upper Prime dwells in the Mud Pill.\nThe Controller of Destiny of the Middle Prime sits steadfast in the Crimson Palace.\nThe Peach Vitality of the Lower Prime holds the register in the Palace of Life.\nThe Venerable Lord of White Prime, the Noble Son Without Peer,\nThe Great Unity Controller of Destiny, the Peach Vitality of Extended Years,\nGrasp the talisman and hold the register, preserving life and rooting existence.\nAscend to the Upper Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chamber,\nWithin the Eight Obscurities and the subtlest of realms,\nDescend to guard the human body, the Mud Pill and Crimson Palace,\nOpening the White Meridians, allowing the true qi to flow freely,\nFrom existence into non-existence, the great Dao is natural.\nThe wonder of the natural is profoundly mysterious, mystery upon mystery.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nUpon completing the incantation, one naturally feels the spirit’s thoughts clear and luminous. Visualize the Marshal of the Central Prime emerging within the body; with prolonged practice, one merges with the original Marshal, achieving spiritual communion and natural resonance. Practicing this at dawn while seated is especially efficacious.\n\n**The Messenger’s Seated Practice**\nFor this method, close the eyes and silently gather the qi of the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys into a single mass, descending it to the Cinnabar Field. Envision the Cinnabar Field as a Jade Crucible, with the inner kidneys as the sun and moon. Assume the Thunder Posture with both hands, circulating the sun and moon’s dual qi within the Jade Crucible. Guide it upward through the Three Passes to the Crown Gate, where it transforms into two streams of golden luminous qi, exiting through the eyes. Pierce the Xun Gate, merging the fire-light with the golden light into a single mass. The master then traces the three characters *Zhang Yuanbo* in the air with a sword mudra, visualizing within the golden and fire lights a messenger: a green-faced, yellow-skinned figure with a knotted headscarf and red hair, clad in golden armor with a red mantle, a green immortal sash, barefoot, wielding an iron ruler. Draw it back to the altar to receive commands.\n\n**The Northern Emperor’s Rite for Cleaving Ghostly Fetuses and Ghostly Qi**\nThe master faces north, visualizing the body as the Six Jia spirits. Hold a battle-axe in the right hand and form the Six Ding mudra with the left hand’s third finger at the second joint—do not move, for movement nullifies its efficacy.\n\nNext, envision the earth as the Black Prison of Fengdu. Burn incense on both sides and place a pure axe before the afflicted person, who stands or sits. The master traces a *tian* (田) character on the ground with the right hand, then writes:\n\n*Divine Lord of the Heavenly Gate*\n*Divine Lord of the Earthly Portal*\n*Divine Lord of the Human Gate*\n*Divine Lord of the Ghostly Path*\n*Divine Lord Piercing the Ghost’s Heart*\n*Divine Lord Breaking the Ghost’s Belly*\n\nRecite the decree:\n*\"Reverently summon the Great Black Dew Spirit, the Sixfold Slayer of Ghosts and Demons. Seize and subdue!\"*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nUpon completing the incantation and forming the characters, instruct the afflicted to cough once, drawing qi to blow into the center of the *tian* character. The master then swiftly seizes the axe and, following the qi, cleaves downward—whereupon the ghostly qi, ghostly fetus, and ghostly mass naturally dissipate.\n\n*The Twenty-First Scroll of the *Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls* concludes.*\n*The Twenty-First Scroll of the *Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls* begins.*\n\nAmalgamating the Five Thunders for Inner Cultivation\nInvoke the All-Encompassing Thunder Duke, summoning the roar of storm winds.\n\nSit in stillness, knock the teeth to gather the spirits, close the eyes, swallow saliva three times, press the tongue to the upper palate, and regulate the qi to allow the Three Palaces to ascend and descend—thus complete.\nClose the mouth and inhale qi three times, exhale qi once, inwardly observe the Cinnabar Field, then refine the qi to churn the saliva once more, swallow it, and guide it down to the Kidney Palace. Close the eyes, summon wrathful qi to mobilize the liver and gallbladder, stirring the wind to transmit the command. Silently recite the *Scripture of Commanding Thunder to Protect Life* once, or the *Great Golden Light Mantra*—this is called \"Refining Thunder.\"\nGreen thunder, red and black, moves to press the Nine Palaces.\n\nClose the eyes, inwardly observe the Liver Palace to regulate the qi, press the tongue to the upper palate, and exhale wrathful qi three times—without making a sound or opening the mouth.\nVisualize the fiery qi blazing intensely, holding the breath for a moment at the heart and abdomen. Then exhale wrathful qi and *he*-qi three times each, rest again, swallow saliva, inhale qi three times, and exhale *he*-qi three times. Thus, the qi will naturally distribute itself across the Nine Palaces, without straying into idle thoughts.\nRed thunder, white qi, ascends to roam the Great Vault.\n\nClose the eyes, inwardly observe the Heart Palace, and gently exhale *he*-qi.\nNext, visualize the qi in wrath, causing the gallbladder qi to circulate—this is the wind fanning the fire qi.\nExhale *chui* and *xi* qi three times each, imagining the fire qi of the Heart Palace steaming beneath the lungs, producing white qi that rises to the Crown Gate. Then, with the nose, draw in the qi from the Crown Gate once and swallow it down to the Kidney Palace. Expand the navel to return the qi to its origin, allowing the Three Palaces to ascend and descend.\nWhite thunder, black and dark, descends to roam the Mysterious Gate.\n\nNext, summon wrathful qi to churn the saliva and fluids, sending them down to the Kidney Palace. Visualize the white qi descending to meet the black qi of the Kidney Palace, surging up from the Fengdu Pass. Exhale qi three times—without letting the ears perceive the sound.\nBlack thunder, yellow and dark, surges through the Eight Extremes.\n\nNext, regulate the qi with wrath, contract the perineum, and move the lower abdomen and flanks seven times. Then visualize the black qi of the Kidney Water passing through the Spleen Palace, merging and refining with the yellow qi of the Spleen Palace.\nNext, inhale qi five times—fire is born when it meets earth, and water is stilled when it meets earth. The Five Qi, refined by earth, coalesce into one mass, naturally circulating throughout the eight directions without straying into idle thoughts.\nYellow thunder, purple and dark, lightning traverses the void.\n\nThe Five Qi, refined in the Spleen Palace, first form yellow qi, its color like a golden tangerine.\nNext, emit the ministerial fire of the Kidney Palace and the civilian fire of the Bladder, descending the sovereign fire of the Heart Palace—this is the true Samādhi Fire. The Spleen is like the belly of a cauldron, with the Bladder and Kidney fires burning below to refine it, turning it a purple-gold hue. Its qi returns to the origin, lush and radiant like lightning, flashing brilliantly as it ascends.\nThe world of the Celestial Cycle, ablaze with scorching winds.\n\nHold the breath for a long while, then turn the gaze inward to the Crown Gate. Visualize the Five Qi returning to the origin, where the Valley Spirit of the Crown Gate emits a purple qi of blazing winds, like the abode of the Divine Radiance Thunder Duke. Its qi flickers and shines, illuminating all the orifices with light.\nWhat spirit would not submit? What ghost would not obey?\n\nWhen the master’s refinement reaches this stage, the Five Qi return to the origin, the Three Flowers gather at the crown, and the purple-blazing qi pervades all heavens and earths, gleaming and flashing. Around the body—left and right, above and below—radiant orbs of light appear. This is the wind, thunder, lightning, clouds, and rain inherent in one’s own body, transforming in unfathomable ways. What ghost would not submit?\nThose who gaze upon me die; those who follow me are enfeoffed.\nThe Black Calendar of the Northern Numinous, the Nine Ugly Purple Lads.\n\nWhen the master’s elixir is complete and the qi is abundant, the purple-blazing qi ascends to the crown—this is the fulfillment of qi.\nThen, emit and guide it upward to the Crown Gate, drawing the qi in through the nose.\nNext, exhale to distribute it left and right, then visualize.\nThus, the qi condenses and takes form, transforming the formless true essence to command and employ the formless ghosts and spirits—this is no idle fancy.\nThe Wind Earl and Rain Master, commanding thunder and leading the winds.\n\nWith one exhalation, refine and transform into the Rain Master before you.\nWith another exhalation, refine and transform into the Wind Earl behind you.\nThe true qi of one’s own body and its inherent true essence—this is the Thunder Duke.\nThe radiance of both eyes—this is the Lightning Mother.\nThis is what is meant by \"practicing the precelestial Great Dao, employing one’s own original spirit.\"\nIf the master maintains this practice consistently from beginning to end, the true qi will be abundant. One may then sit and summon, stand and invoke, with responses as swift as a moment. Command spirits and employ generals, summon rain and stir winds—just as when using talismanic water to treat illness and expel evil. It is merely a matter of supplementing others’ insufficient qi with one’s own abundant qi. How could it fail to achieve immediate results?\nThunder Duke, Thunder Duke, possessed of great numinous power.\nWhere the celestial talisman arrives, thunderclaps resound in the empty sky.\n\nWhen the master has completed the refinement and the spirit emerges from within outward, draw a talisman from the sleeve. Whether summoning thunder and lightning, commanding thunder and rain, or dispelling malevolence and eliminating demons, apply it as needed.\nRecite the above four lines aloud, visualize as instructed, and point or wield the talisman to send it forth—there is nowhere it cannot go.\n\n**Seated Practice with Hand Seals and Secret Techniques**\n*\"The autumn waves of green water in Hai, limpid and clear—*\nFirst step through the Vast and Falling Dipper to the Star of Heavenly Glory, sit in full lotus, clench the fists, and seal the Hai trigram. Draw the qi of the Kidney Palace into the Heart Mansion to merge, then rinse the Flower Pool thirty-six times, visualizing the divine water as pure and limpid.\n*A thousand-catty iron axe on You, light at the head—*\nAt *Shen*, press both hands into the seat, visualizing the thousand sinews and ten thousand veins all unobstructed. The divine water naturally turns the windlass along the spine, ascending directly to the Mud Pill Palace.\n*By the river, the noon willow tree at Wei, blown down by the wind—*\nVisualize the Heavenly Pillar collapsing the Milky Way, reaching the Twelve-Story Tower and entering the Three Passes. The Willow Star resides in the Heavenly Pond—this is the forehead.\n*Even if I embraced Chang’e, I would not be startled.\"*\n\nAt *Wu*, interlock the hands below the navel, cupping them firmly. Visualize the divine water irrigating the five viscera without leaking outward—here the Alchemical Maiden resides at the center, governing the divine water.\n\n*White as snow in the heavens at You—*\nForm the Thunder Mudra with both hands. From the mouth, issue wind and clouds, meeting the celestial thunder at *Xun* Gate and *Zhen* Palace.

Let the tongue become the thunder-axe, the gallbladder transform into thunderclaps. Visualize the heart-spirit as sudden flame, leading the Five Qi’s Thunder Duke to summon rain, emerging from the Heavenly Gate to strike the convergence of *Xun* wind and rain. Then, form the Thunder Mudra with both hands, tracing from the flanks up to the ears and releasing the *tiao* mudra.\n\n*Light as dust in the void at Si—*\nVisualize all spirits within the body having departed. Clasp the middle fingers with both hands, gathering the spleen-spirit to guard the self’s divine abode—thus the body, inside and out, becomes weightlessly buoyant.\n\n*Heavy as a thousand-catty iron—*\nAt *Yin*, form the Thunder Mudra with both hands, drawing all spirits back into the abdomen, each infused with the qi of true thunder. Visualize the body filling and solidifying, heavy as a thousand-catty iron.\n\nThe Four Brothers of the Weaving Maiden—\nthe twenty-eight lunar lodgings’ bat star—command the eight directions’ eight trigrams’ thunder deities, stationed at the body’s eight nodes (the hands and feet):\n*Gou-Lou* brings auspicious fortune,\n*Hai* ascends the monk to attain form.\n\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!*\n\nInvoke the eight thunder deities’ names. With both hands forming the Thunder Mudra, rise from the seated posture, visualizing the thunder spirits escorting you—swift as thunderclaps and sudden flame—ascending from *Gen* to hold the command upon the altar, merging and uniting with the talisman to summon thunder and enact the work.\n\n**Daily Seated Practice:**\nWith the left hand forming the Thunder Mudra, sit facing *Xun* from *Qian*. First draw a mouthful of *Xun* qi into the Cinnabar Field. The right hand’s Thunder Mudra presses below the navel without moving. The left hand points the *Zhang* Envoy mudra while reciting the incantation:\n*Om hum hum. San tan na han nan yan qian yi chi.*\n\nThe *Dui* trigram commands the valiant hosts,\nThe *Gen* palace seals the demonic gates.\nThe *Li* palace mounts the wheel of fire,\nThe *Kan* waters surge with towering waves.\nEntering the gate, they shake the earth’s axis,\nThe *Zhen* thunder crashes with a thunderous roar.\nFierce winds topple mountains and peaks,\nAll generals lend their strength to my body.\nGreat Void Perfected, Great Numinous Perfected,\nDescend swiftly, descend swiftly!\nBy decree, I summon the thunder deities of all bureaus—\nLet the thunder spirits hasten to the altar,\nThose who dare arrive late shall first be destroyed in form.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!*\n\nOnce summoned before me, proclaim:\n\"By your divine power, I call forth the Jade Pivot Executioners—Jiang, Bi, Hua, Lei, Chen, the Five Envoys—\nTo divide their forms and transform their *qi*,\nDescending to infuse my Cinnabar Field.\"\n\nRecite again the incantation of summons:\n\"I act by the August Emperor’s decree,\nSummoning the Five Thunders.\nClouds race and lightning flashes,\nAiding me to manifest might.\nSweeping away demonic filth,\nBeheading demons and vanquishing wrongs.\nWhere the divine radiance shines,\nTen thousand demons are all shattered.\nThe Flowing Bell urgently summons,\nThunder and fire surge in flight.\n*Om. Tra li chi hum.*\nFour-eyed, nine-uglies—\nSeized by thunder’s voice and lightning’s glare.\"\n\nDraw a mouthful of *Xun* *qi* into the Cinnabar Field, then recite:\n\"Yin and Yang part,\nThe Five *Qi* linger and sway.\nFollowing my command,\nSwiftly arise the rapid thunder.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!*\"\n\n**Inner Cultivation of the Divine Empyrean: Three Nines Yield Seven**\nEach dawn, enter the oratory and sit upright. Knock the teeth, settle the mind, and inwardly observe the heart—\nThe heart is no-heart.\nExternally observe the form—\nThe form is no-form.\nObserve afar all things—\nThings are no-things.\n\nSuddenly forget the form, and visualize within the Lower Cinnabar Field an infant in its newborn state. The five *qi* of the five viscera, each bearing its corresponding color, ascend to the Middle Field. The infant transforms into a Perfected Person, mirroring your own form, with the Four Beasts arrayed before, behind, left, and right.\n\nThe Perfected Person ascends the layered tower to the Mud Palace of the Nine Palaces, visualizing the Three Masters seated upon jeweled thrones, vast as lotus seeds, the sun and moon radiantly clear. The Perfected Person kneels and recites, as do the Three Masters, their mouths emitting true *qi* that pours into your body. Upon completing the recitation, next visualize a Fire Dragon emerging from the heart. The Perfected Person mounts the Fire Dragon, spiraling through the Dipper and past the Winnowing Basket, ascending directly to the summit of the Empyrean beneath the Thunder Citadel.\n\nAfter recitation, with the brows’ surge, open the outer Thunder Palace. Beneath the many Jade Towers, the Three Masters sit together, flanked by the host of Perfected Officials. The Perfected Person kneels and recites as before, without fixed repetitions, following the intent of the prayer. Then, descending from the Mud Palace of the Niwan to the Middle Palace, the Perfected Person reverts to its original form and returns to the Lower Cinnabar Field, seated within a sphere of azure jade and lapis lazuli radiance. After twenty-seven days, there is no need to visualize the infant—only the Perfected Person. Proceed from the heart upward to the Mud Palace of the Nine, bowing in homage to the Perfected King, then return to the Crimson Chamber, seated within the Jade Light.\n\nThis Way is most secret; practice it with utmost care. Should even a trace of worldly thought intrude, perfection will not be attained. Not only will the numinous response be faint, but one may incur reproach from the celestial bureaus. Such is the subtlety of the inner workings of recitation.\n\nThe humble official, your subject [Name], on this day prostrates with purified heart, mouth, and body, offering devotion and presenting this petition to the Jade Pure Perfected King, the Southern Culmen Longevity Great Emperor, the Eastern Culmen Azure Radiance Great Emperor, the Great Unity Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy, and the Nine Heavens’ Hanwen Personage, the Vermilion Mound Life-Deliverance Heavenly Worthy. May the celestial compassion cast its radiance downward to bear witness.\n\nYour subject delights in longevity and has received the transmission of the supreme Dao, vowing to relieve the afflictions of the people. Now, first invoking the correct *qi* and aiding the circulation of the precious talismans, I humbly beseech the Perfected King’s longevity-*qi* and the *qi* of the sun’s essence and moon’s splendor to descend and infuse me. May my Three Fields and Nine Palaces, the hundred bones and five limbs, the eighty-four thousand pores, the twelve thousand rays of essence, and the three hundred sixty joints be inwardly and outwardly luminous, with *ying* and *wei* fully replete. May the Three Lights merge, the Five *Qi* return to the Origin, the body be purified, and the ten thousand *qi* suffuse the cosmos. When employing talismans, dispatching generals, or capturing malevolent spirits and vanquishing demons, may the response be immediate and the spirits obedient.\n\nAbove, I pray for the protection of the state and the peace of households, benefiting people and aiding all beings. Next, may my ancestors of myriad generations, the suffering souls in darkness, ascend to the celestial realms, their bodies secure and at peace, bowing before the Perfected King and ascending to the Golden Towers.\n\nYour subject’s heart is filled with boundless reverence and devotion. Thus, I speak.\n\n**Forming Emptiness into Brahma Mantra**\nForm emptiness into Brahma, and true *qi* arises spontaneously.\nVermilion script on jade, the Eight Might Dragon Script.\nPreserve and regulate the kalpic destiny, ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance.\nHeal illness and sever evil, bringing peace to all things.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Longevity Great Emperor’s statute and command!*\n\nFacing east, bow thirty-six times from the heart, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and visualize true *qi* coalescing into the Divine Empyrean Lord. Within the radiant *qi* of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Golden Light Jade Terrace, behold the Divine Empyrean King descending upon a golden terrace and jade hall, with vermilion doors and emerald windows, clad in purple robes and regal cap. Crimson slippers rest upon a jade mat; to his left, the sun; to his right, the moon. From the crown of the Perfected King’s head descends azure *qi* with nine rays, red and purple with three rays, gently wafting downward. With the heart’s red *qi* and the liver’s azure *qi*, I surge upward to meet and intertwine, inhaling eighty-one breaths to gather in the Lower Field, forming the sun; sixty-four breaths to the Upper Field, forming the moon; thirty-six breaths to the Middle Field, forming a pearl, clear as water, within which the Perfected King resides.\n\nBow nine times from the heart and recite:\nThe Three Lights radiantly clear, ascending to the Nine Heavens.\nGolden chambers and jade halls, where the Five Treasures and magic mushrooms grow.\nMysterious yellow and purple *qi* come to illumine my body.\nJade lads and jade maidens bring me their numinous power.\nThe Nine *Qi* unite as one, the Three Lights merge in harmony.\nAbove floats the Purple Canopy, ascending into the Purple Court.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Pure Perfected King’s statute and command!*\n\nThe Azure Radiance Emperor Lord, the Divine Empyrean Perfected King.\nThe Fusang Sun Emperor, the Western Culmen Moon Sovereign.\nThe Four Perfected and Three *Qi* coalesce into azure luminous radiance.\nThe *qi* of the Four Perfected Saints’ essence merges into one, forming a vibrant azure hue like grapevine, clear as water. It permeates the Three Fields. Above, at the center of the brows; in the middle, at the heart; below, beneath the navel—there dwell the Three Corpse Spirits, which the golden light subdues. Within, visualize the Perfected King. The Perfected King appears within the azure *qi*, consuming at dawn and bowing at dusk, tirelessly ascending in golden light.\n\nMy body possesses golden light, connecting to the Thirty-Two Heavens.\nThe sun and moon revolve within; the heart and kidneys intermingle.\nNext, employ the golden light to connect with the Perfected King in the Divine Empyrean Heaven, the sun to his left, the moon to his right. With the heart and kidneys of my body intermingling, internally revolve them as one.\nThe Azure Empyrean Jade Chamber.\nHere, the sun, moon, heart, and kidneys each return to their place, exhaled into unity, so that my body is no longer seen—only the spontaneous Perfected King. Then, one may summon generals and command troops.\n\nInhale the jade radiance.\nDraw in *qi* to the Cinnabar Field, and malevolent spirits vanish of themselves; the Three Corpses perish.\nThe malevolent *qi* of my body is eradicated. Three nines yield seven; bow before the Perfected King.\nFirst, gather the Four Perfected and Three *Qi*, uniting them in my Cinnabar Field, like the azure luster of grapes, its light illuminating the ten directions. Next, borrow the true fire of the Three *Qi* from the south, blazing forth to the east, where the wood sees the fire grow ever fiercer. Passing slightly beyond the Kan position, it reaches the west, the metal of the seven numbers, transforming into the Perfected King, golden and radiant. I am then the Perfected King. Afterward, my Perfected Person emerges, bowing thirty-six times before the Perfected King, as the myriad generals pay homage. This is yet another swift method.\n\n**Method of Ingesting Talismans**\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, draw the *qi* from the divine palace of the southeast—its hues of azure, crimson, and violet—and swallow it. Each day, inscribe the talisman and consume it. Press the tongue against the upper palate, invoke the *qi* of Golden Light, and recite the Hidden Names of the Three Heavens along with the *Siddhaṃ* Mantra for Empty Completion. Then swallow the *qi* of Golden Light. This is the Supreme Talisman of the First Heaven by Perfected Master Sa, taken thrice daily. Over nine days, twenty-seven talismans are ingested, following the principle of three nines yielding seven.\n\nTo the right: recite the *Siddhaṃ* Mantra for Empty Completion, blending divine *qi* to inscribe the talisman with the Hidden Names of the Three Heavens. Chant:\n*\"Thunder Prince, uproot the source of illness.\"*\nSeven characters.\n\n**Fire Palace Sitting Practice**\nSit in stillness with a tranquil heart. At any time of practice, gaze inward at the heart, exhale impure *qi* three times, then regulate the breath one hundred twenty cycles. Visualize within the space between the two kidneys a single point, where the *qi* of the left sun and right moon—yin and yang—conjoin in the Cinnabar Field. Abide in non-action, allowing the *qi* to ascend naturally to the heart, then return to the kidneys. After a moment, the two *qi* meet in one aperture, coalescing into a golden orb of light, like fire refining the golden elixir pill—yet it is not mine to claim. Witness the five *qi* emerging from the five viscera, encircling this golden orb, ascending from the coccyx along the spine to the Mud Pill Palace. For a time, visualize the sun and moon within the Mud Pill Palace shining brightly, then sense the sweet nectar of the Flowery Pond, swallowing it into the aperture. Abide in non-action. If practiced two or three times, conclude by exhaling fiery *qi* two or three times.\n\n**Secret Principles of Internal Practice**\nSit in stillness with a tranquil heart, draw in the ancestral *qi*, and swallow it down to the Cavernous Abyss Palace, reaching the Mysterious Pivot Palace. It descends through the nine earths and nine ramparts, following intention to the Mysterious Pivot Palace. Draw a mouthful of northern *qi*, blending it in the Yellow Court Palace. Rub the face and comb the hair, visualizing the luminous white *qi* arriving from the west. Massage the Inner Pass nine times and the Outer Pass nine times. From the coccyx, the *qi* ascends along both sides of the spine to the back of the brain, merging into one. It then divides into five paths, entering the Mud Pill Palace and ascending to the Palace of the Primordial Sovereign. Next, circulate water and fire: refine the true *qi* of the Great Yin Jade Pool of Yellow Blossoms on the right, blending it with the true water of the Great Yang on the left. Unite it with the heart’s *qi*, emanating true fire that illuminates the entire body, inside and out, with radiant light.\n\n**Thunder Crystal *Qi* Sitting Practice**\nBefore sitting, settle the mind and calm the thoughts. Clench both fists, gaze with both eyes at the Central Palace, where a single point of golden light shines, resplendent with the character *□*. Rotate the Earth Axis, sweep the Celestial Pass, and arrive at the Crimson Palace. Visualize the sixth star of the Southern Dipper, from which a messenger descends. Utter the sound *□*, merging into one golden orb. Draw it into the Central Palace, then swallow the nectar of the Flowery Pond. After a moment, envision the entire body suffused with fiery *qi*, then open the eyes—its efficacy is extraordinary.\n\n**Five Thunder Ramparts**\n\n**Rampart Incantation**\nHeavenly thunder rumbles low,\nDivine thunder roars mightily.\nDragon thunder stirs the waters,\nWater thunder churns the waves.\nEarthly thunder commands fire,\nThunderbolts strike without bound.\nAt the divine mechanism’s release,\nDemons and spirits are annihilated.\nBy the Emperor’s decree,\nAct swiftly and without delay.\n\n**Following the Rampart**\n**Reversing the Rampart**\n\nDaily, note the direction where thunder and lightning manifest. When conducting rituals, first determine the direction of your current position to summon responsive wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning—its wonders are beyond words. If thunder enters the Central Palace, do not proceed with affairs. On such days, the Celestial Generals don their crowns to attend the Primordial Origin; those who practice the arts must be aware of this.\n\n**Primordial August Talisman**\n*Primordial August Talisman descends.*\n□□□□□□\n□□□□□□\n□□□□□□\n□□□□□□\n\nThis talisman is addressed to the Golden Gates of the Primordial August, to be executed in accordance with the decree.\nOnce the *Talisman for Affairs* arrives, the myriad spirits obey in unison.\nFollow the commands of the talisman and act swiftly.\n\n**Decree:**\nThis talisman is inscribed on yellow paper with cinnabar for prayers of clear skies, on black paper with ink for prayers of rain, and on blue paper with white powder for prayers of snow.\n\n**Divine Might Incantation**\nWind and thunder rise, lightning and thunder are born,\nDivine might descends, swiftly heed the decree.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the thunder’s law and command!*\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, draw *qi* three times into the five viscera, sealing them with *qi* to manifest authority. Then, with the *zi* trigram in the left hand and the *hai* trigram in the right, silently summon:\n- Rampart General Zhao Shouyan,\n- Rampart-Building General Xiong Xiushang,\n- Rampart-Activating General Tian Zhanyao.\nEnvision the three generals all present before you.\n\nNext, step outside the rampart and circle left three times—this is called \"restraining the three hun and stabilizing the seven po.\" They must not step beyond the rampart’s bounds. Then, step the *Breaking Earth and Summoning Thunder Rampart*.\n\n**Mnemonic Formula:**\n*Xun* double, *Li* to the right, *Kun* single to the left,\n*Zhen* single to the right, *Dui* is double.\nGhost’s Gate to the left, *Kan* to the right,\nHeaven’s Gate stands double, gaze upon the Celestial Rampart.\n\n**Rampart Incantation**\nJade Pivot Divine Rampart, obeying the Perfected King’s teachings,\nBreaking earth to summon thunder, executing iniquity and calamity.\nFive Thunder Messengers, swiftly attend the altar.\nFollow my incantation and decree, dispelling misfortune.\nUnlock the Five Departments, descending great divine radiance.\nInfuse my brush and inkstone, inscribing celestial seal-script.\nWater demons vanish,\nGhostly paths flee in terror.\n\nSwift as the thunder’s decree, obey!\n\n**Mnemonic Formula:**\n*Kan* double, *Gen* single—step left to cross *Qian*;\nDouble *Zhen* ascends, double *Dui* follows likewise.\n*Kun* single to the left, *Li* single to the right, *Xun* stands double.\nThe Three Terraces return, then face the heavens.\n\n**Mnemonic Formula:**\n*Kui* double, two to the right, three return left;\nFour ascends double, five to the right single.\nSix to the left single, marked as the auxiliary.\nThe Celestial Rampart stands double, breaking *Kun*’s barrier.\n\nWhen stepping the right method to the third Dipper station,\nAssume the left Thunder Formation, right Sword Mudra,\nHands on hips, summon the generals.\nVisualize their arrival, focus intent, and recite the incantation:\n\nHeaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, Stars, Wind and Rain, Thunder and Lightning Spirits,\nI invoke the Nine Heavens’ Sage Immortal, Perfected Master Dong.\nSwiftly summon the Five Thunders,\nDivine generals, descend with haste!\nSwift as the Supreme Emperor’s decree!\n\n**Inverted Decade Incantation**\n*Qian*’s honored radiance, *Kun*’s inner flourishing,\nThe Two Modes harmonize, the Six Directions prosper.\nBack to heaven, face the earth—eternal peace and clarity.\nResponding to the Primordial Sovereign,\nUpper robe, lower skirt.\n*Zhen*, *Li*, *Kan*, *Dui*—assisting the Fusang.\n*Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, *Xun*—tiger’s step, dragon’s rampart.\nHeaven’s Gate, Earth’s Portal, Human Gate, Ghostly Path.\nWho guards me?

Visualize the talisman within, then take the *qi* of *Xun* to cover it.\n\nTo summon thunder, present the talisman of the corresponding palace, combining it with the external talisman—this is called \"severing and verification.\" The practitioner must visualize themselves as the Heavenly Perfected August One, clad in a garment of *jie* leaves, in the likeness of the Divine Farmer, seated in *Qian* facing *Xun*.\n\n**Uniting Qi Incantation**\n\"Thunder King of the Current Season,\nbestow your majestic radiance.\nEnter my five viscera,\nsweep away misfortune.\nMay my three *hun* be clear,\nmy seven *po* harmonious.\nFulfill my vow,\ndissolve past debts.\"\n\n\"Hasten, hasten, as the law commands.\"\n\nRecite nine times.\n\n**Five Directions’ Original Body Incantation**\n\"Celestial Officials, Earthly Waters,\nMetal Horns, *Kang* Clan,\n*Fang*, *Xin*, *Wei*, *Ji*—\ntransform evil into blood.\nBy the command of the Great Emperor of Lifespan.\"\n\n\"Heaven is clear, Earth is tranquil,\nremove poison by decree, seize and bind.\nGather *Jing*, *Gui*, *Liu*,\n*Xing*, *Zhang*, *Yi*, *Zhen*—\nall spirits, assist in swift capture.\"\n\n\"*Geng-Xin* metal *qi*, *Wu-Ji* *Kui*,\n*Lou*, *Wei*, *Mao*, *Bi*, *Zi*, *Shen*—\nhasten to aid my practice,\nrush to my altar and stir thunder’s roar.\nHasten, hasten.\"\n\n\"Reverently summon the Holy Śramaṇa of the North,\nhear my invocation and descend from afar.\nWith unbound hair and sword in hand,\ncome to the star altar.\n*Dou*, *Niu*, *Nü*, *Xu*, *Wei*, *Shi*, *Bi*—\nthe Celestial Pass descends, decree slays and seizes.\nMountains align with their positions,\nMetal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—\nthe five directions follow the true *qi* in capture.\"\n\n**Summoning *Xin* Heavenly Lord Incantation**\n\"Fierce minister *Xin Hanchen* of thunder,\nfangs like sword-trees, flames spewing smoke.\nOverturning rivers, uprooting seas, toppling heaven and earth,\nuprooting mountains, shattering stones, dredging springs.\nIf ferocious spirits or malevolent ghosts dare transgress,\nmy body’s gaze will make mountains crumble.\nFire chariots and thunderbolts blaze ceaselessly,\nsoaring through clouds, riding mists across the void.\nHasten, hasten, as the law commands.\"\n\n**Generative Incantation**\n\"Lord Thunder of All Heavens,\nflying thunder shakes the sky.\nGreen thunder, red *qi*—\nascend to the highest heavens.\nRed thunder, yellow *qi*—\ndirect thunder to the center.\nYellow thunder, white *qi*—\npervade and stabilize the nine palaces.\nWhite thunder, black *qi*—\ndescend to the dark depths of *Xuanfeng*.\nBlack thunder, green *qi*—\ndirect thunder to return east.\"\n\n**Destructive Incantation**\n\"Lord Thunder of All Heavens,\ncall forth thunder and shake the winds.\nGreen thunder, white *qi*—\npervade and stabilize the nine palaces.\nWhite thunder, red *qi*—\nascend to the highest heavens.\nRed thunder, black *qi*—\ndescend to the dark depths of *Xuanfeng*.\nBlack thunder, yellow *qi*—\nsurge through the Supreme Ultimate’s radiance.\nYellow thunder, green *qi*—\nflash lightning across the void.\nUnite with humanity,\nprosper with the Dao.\nHasten, hasten—*Jiao*, *Ji*,\n*Jing*, *Zhen*, *Zhang*, *Yi*.\nEnveloping the world in scorching winds,\nwhat ghost does not perish?\nWhat spirit does not submit?\nThose who defy me die,\nthose who follow me are enfeoffed.\nBlack chronicles of the North,\nNine Uglies and Purple Youths.\nWind Earl and Rain Master,\ndrive thunder and drink rainbows.\nWhere the Thunder Duke arrives,\nten thousand ghosts vanish without trace.\nHasten, hasten, as thunder’s law commands.\"\n\nAfter reciting the preceding incantation, black clouds swiftly gather at the *weilü*, ascend the spine, and reach the *niwan* palace. The crown of the head splits open, revealing a great spirit soaring and standing in the Great Void.\n\n**Closing Incantation**\n\"East severs the path of mountain *xiao*,\n*Mao* and *You* sever the gates of stone spirits,\n*You* and *Nan* sever the path of the Heavenly Master’s arrival,\n*Wu* and *Bei* sever the village of the Earthly Master’s departure,\n*Zi* severs the blood-eating ghosts of the five directions,\nthe Central Heavenly Way is severed,\n*Hai* severs the Earthly Way,\n*Si* severs the Human Way,\n*Shen* severs the Ghost Way.\nAt *Yin*, the Five Thunders decree a single strike—\nevil ghosts’ roots are severed.\nI call upon the Five Thunder Envoys\nto block and seal the gates of ghosts and spirits.\"\n\nAfter the incantation, visualize your body as a thunder citadel: thunder chariots at the left ear, fire chariots at the right; celestial thunder at the left foot, earthly thunder at the right. The five fingers of the left hand are the five envoys. Your spirit follows the great spirit, soaring through the Great Void. Your body becomes the great spirit, ascending to the celestial court.\n\nBehold the heavenly gates manifesting in numinous radiance. Present a vermilion tablet from afar, gazing toward the celestial gates. See golden-red light in myriad rays, standing upon the dragon terrace. Report today’s affairs, then step back to witness jade maidens bearing the Jade Emperor’s golden writ, decreeing the Thunder Bureau.\n\nSoon, the great spirit stands before the throne, receiving the mandate. The great spirit bears the writ and follows. Bowing in farewell, descend from the celestial gates, the great spirit leading the troops below.\n\nIn an instant, your spirit returns to the center. The great spirit stands atop *Xun*, bearing the writ. By the method, absorb it into your body. The thunder spirits of the four directions are all gathered into the golden writ, and the myriad spirits assemble. Then swallow the *Total Seizing Talisman*, entrusting it to the great spirit to bear.\n\nWithin the talisman, hundreds and thousands of palace generals enter therein, enveloped in golden light.\n\n**Returning Spirit Incantation**\n\"The Five Thunder Generals transform into a thousand perfected,\nI now unite with you in form.\nThe Golden Mouth of the Most High transmits the record,\nteaching me to regenerate a body beyond this body.\nHasten, hasten, as the law commands.\"\n\nOnce the *Total Seizing Talisman* is inscribed, summon forth the great spirit to stand in the *Xun* Palace, bearing the golden writ. With mudras formed in hand, call forth the hundreds and thousands of palace officials to the altar, drawing them all at once into the golden writ. They are entirely transformed into golden light, then absorbed into the talisman—the talisman being the golden writ itself.\n\n**The Five Envoys and Their Uses**\n*Eastern Envoy, Jiang:* Governs healing, expelling evil, and seizing malevolent spirits. Pacifies people, protects creatures, and fulfills all prayers and petitions.\n*Southern Envoy, Bi; Western Envoy, Hua:* For prayers of rain, face the drought-stricken direction, form the mudra, and summon them. Inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on black paper. Recite the incantation while spraying water from an eel’s mouth, and black clouds will surge forth, thunder and rain arriving instantly. Point to where the dragon stirs. When employing these envoys, they command the local earth spirits and the Thunder Department, bringing rain across forty *li*. If possessing a body, they immediately transmit the Five Envoys—these envoys are most mighty and fierce.\n*Northern Envoy, Lei; Central Envoy, Chen:* In practicing the Five Talismans, resonance must arise between heart and mouth. Inscribe in cinnabar on yellow paper, burn each talisman to ash, and swallow it with an infusion of *jiangzhen* incense. For prayers of clear skies or rain, the response is extraordinary. To exorcise malevolent spirits, use gold coins and cloud-horses to swiftly attain efficacy. When first practicing, recite the incantation daily, inscribe the talismans according to the method, and swallow them for sixty days—then the thunder spirits will respond at once.\n\n**Steps for Praying Rain**\n*First Day:* Establish the altar and install the positions of the thunder spirits. Submit the memorial petition, attaching the left writ to the document.\n*Second Day:* At dawn, dispatch the Five Envoys. Next, bury the *yang* talisman and burn the *yin* talisman. Press the left hand upon the thunder chart, sit facing *Xun* from *Qian*, and draw a mouthful of *Xun* qi, swallowing it into the cinnabar field. Keep the right hand’s thunder chart pressed against the navel, unmoving. For example, on a *jiazi* day, visualize the eastern blue qi generating southern fire; the southern red qi generating central earth; the central yellow qi generating western metal; the western white qi generating northern water; and the northern black qi generating eastern wood. Then, with the left hand, form the mudra of Envoy Zhang and summon him before the altar to attend to the matter. Extol the divine charioteers, and invoke the Five Envoys—Yu, Bi, Hua, Lei, and Chen—of the *Yushu Slaying and Investigating* Department. With the sword mudra, cleave open the *Xun* gate. The ritual master presses the tongue to the upper palate, visualizing the incense smoke as a golden bridge extending to the *Xun* gate. Recite the heart incantation of the Five Envoys, and the envoys of the five directions descend along the golden bridge to stand before the incense burner on the altar.\n\nThe ritual master exhales the liver’s blue qi to summon Envoy Chen; exhales the spleen’s yellow qi to summon Envoy Lei; blows the kidney’s black qi to summon Envoy Bi; breathes the heart’s red qi to summon Envoy Hua; and sighs the lung’s white qi to summon Envoy Jiang. These merge with the incense smoke and the Five Envoys. According to the time limit set by the matter’s intent, offer prayers and dispatch them to ascend to heaven, commanding the clouds and governing the rain. Employ the double chart: circulate from the kidneys to the crown, then execute the mudra for wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning, casting it outward.\n\n*Third Day:* After the meal, ascend the altar. Burn talismans to dispatch the envoys. Recite the *Three Purities Incantation* and the *Golden Light Incantation*. Unfurl the banner, plant the sword, and summon Envoy Zhang. Burn the urgent summons, the official document, and the right contract. Dispatch the envoys and ritual masters into refinement, or rest briefly. Summon the Generals of Establishing the *Gang* and Treading the Dipper, step the *Breaking Earth* and *Thunder Gang*, or the *Dipper Gang*, or the *Wind, Cloud, Thunder, Rain, and Lightning Gang*. Step the *Thunder Gang* to *Qian*, then exhale qi to transform it into a golden bridge leading directly before the ancestral masters. Lead the celestial officials of the Golden Palace forward to submit the memorial. Upon receiving the decree, step the *Yin Dipper Gang*, descend, and exit the celestial gate. Hold the *Jade Text* in the left hand and the *Heavenly Flail* in the right, or form the sword mudra. Step to the *Xun* direction and inscribe in the void: *\"By the Emperor’s command, urgently summon the thunder spirits.\"* The *Xun* gate swings wide open. Issue the order to summon Envoy Zhang and all the generals, merging with the previous incantation.\n\nThen perform the triple offering and blood oath. First, burn the *Opening Thunder City Talisman* and the talismans of all the generals to dispatch them. Whether joyful or wrathful, send them forth one by one, setting a deadline for clouds to rise and rain to fall, greatly manifesting efficacy. Use the *yin* chart on *yin* days and the *yang* chart on *yang* days.\n\n**Example of Cloud-Raising**\nSuppose today at the *yin* hour, you receive the petition for prayer, or to rouse thunder to strike a temple or slay evil. First, inscribe the eastern talisman, consume one copy yourself, then burn another over the incense. Close your eyes, calm your heart, and visualize your body as withered wood, burned by fire and reborn as an infant. Envision the liver’s blue qi stretching thousands of *zhang* toward the eastern *yin* position. After a long while, step the *gang* and kick the *yin* position, shouting: *\"Eastern Wind and Thunder Envoys, subordinate to the *yin*-hour Direct Talisman Thunder Spirit, swiftly raise clouds in this direction!\"* After a long while, visualize the eastern blue qi stretching thousands of *zhang* into your body, then inhale the form of the eastern talisman, directing it straight east. Slightly open your eyes to observe—vigorous clouds will arise. If clouds appear in all four directions, break the cloud qi of the primary direction to exalt its supremacy. If wind arises from the east as a sign, this is called *Overlapping the Correct Chart*. Then employ the *Counter-Flow Method*: face the western *shen* position to draw the eastern qi, blow it toward the west, and again blow the eastern talisman toward the west. Pray: *\"The eastern direct talisman general has already manifested cloud qi. Western counter-flow *shen*-hour direct envoy thunder spirit, swiftly respond with cloud qi to fulfill the vow!\"* If the response is slow, blow the lung’s qi upon the western talisman toward the western *shen* position—it will respond at once. Thereafter, follow your heart’s prayers to summon rain or rouse thunder, all according to your intent. Finally, burn the *Pass Document* to set the day and hour, and the great response will be attained.\n\nOnce the talismans are circulated in succession, guide each direction’s qi and the Five Envoys’ talismans into their respective palaces to station and reside. When employing them, use the talisman of the corresponding palace along with the Five Envoys’ talismans. For the eastern talisman, draw it into the liver palace through the nose.\n\nAs with the south, west, north, and center, draw each in through the nose in like manner.\n\n**Opening the Thunder Citadel Talisman for Rain-Petitioning**\nFirst employ this to command the *Qian*-Heaven’s thunder and lightning.\nWield the brush to issue the decree, reciting the incantation ten times or more:\n\n*Incantation:*\nEastern *jia-yi* Wood,\n*Qian*’s origin, prosperity, perseverance, and rectitude.\nTrue *qi* swiftly flows,\nI act by the Jade Emperor’s command.\nHeaven and Earth lie transverse in my palm,\nthe *Xun* Palace is the Thunder Gate.\nYin and Yang eternally endure,\nconcealed or manifest, they follow my *qi*.\nWhen employed, thunder and rain surge;\nthe Five Thunders hasten to descend.\nAid me in walking the Great Dao,\ndare not rashly violate this covenant.\nHeavenly *Ding* shall behead you,\nFengdu shall obliterate your form.\nSwiftly, swiftly, by the decree of the Highest Divine *Shenxiao* True King, the Great Emperor of Eternal Life!\n\n**Feathered-Soldier Talisman for Rain-Petitioning and Thunder-Driving**\nThe left eye is the sun, the right eye the moon.\nHeaven is round, Earth is square—clouds and mist withdraw, Yang gathers.\n*Qian, Kan, Gen, Zhen, Xun, Li, Kun, Dui*—hastily, fire drives thunder, rain descends at once!\nWind, clouds, thunder, lightning, hail—Five Marshals, swiftly arise!\nDrag the heavens, haul the earth, shake the mountains, steam the clouds!\nSky darkens, earth dims, the Nine Paths are sealed—rain arrays in flowing streams, drought demons are struck down!\nStomp the *Kuigang*, unleash thunderclaps; kick to rouse thunder!\nFrom the left armpit, blow clouds to shake heaven and earth; from the right armpit, summon spirits to overturn the four seas!\nWind rises, sweet rains fall—the Thunder Decree, the Azure Lord, the Dragon-Thunder Lord, the Earth Deity, the Thunder-Mastering Great Spirits, the Thunder-Typifying Great Spirits, the Dragon-Driving Great Spirits, the Dragon-Searching Great Spirits, the Dragon-Seizing Great Spirits, the Dragon-Collecting Great Spirits, the Wind-Stirring Great Spirits, the Wind-Calling Great Spirits, the Wind-Drumming Great Spirits, the Lightning-Wielding Great Spirits, the King of Thunder-Surging Great Spirits, the King of Thunder-Array Fire Chariot Great Spirits, the King of Thunder-Array Water Chariot Great Spirits, the Thunder-Fire Divine Soldiers—three hundred thousand in number—hear my summons and come in haste!

the eyes. With the left hand, form the *Zi-Wen* Thunder Seal, while the right hand assumes the Sword Mudra at the waist. Circulate the kidney *qi* downward, visualizing it passing through the *Weilü* (Coccyx Gate), ascending to the *Jiaji* (Spinal Pass), then guiding it to the *Jianggong* (Crimson Palace). Next, circulate a breath of heart *qi* in the same manner. The two *qi* of the Crimson Palace merge as one. Press the tongue against the upper palate, envisioning the Golden Bridge forming as it sweeps into place. Circulate the *qi* to inscribe the Five Peaks, completing the characters *Ling You Shen* (靈祐神). With the true water of the *Huachi* (Flower Pool) beneath the tongue, swallow it into the *Shenshi* (Spirit Chamber).\n\nThen, using the *Precelestial True Northern Emperor Incantation*, form the seal and rub the abdomen five times. Inhale through the nose, drawing in a stream of golden *qi* from the *Yin Dou* (Yin Dipper) □ star, guiding it together into the chamber below. Visualize a *Yang Dou* (Yang Dipper) rising, and summon the *qi* of the Dipper’s *Gang* (Asterism). Immediately recite the secret incantation to hasten its arrival:\n\n*Om yan li □ yan li □ hum hum ma ni.*\n\nRecite the right-hand incantation three times, visualizing the various generals in their regalia arriving at the altar.

Visualize the black and red qi of the two kidneys entering the talisman, forming two envoys—these are the two strokes beneath the ribs. When summoning, write *Hasten here!*\n\n**Secret Essentials of Internal Activation**\nThe adept transforms into a Thunder Envoy, concentrating the qi of the five viscera in the Yellow Court, where a True Person of Cinnabar Origin suddenly arises.\nRecite:\n*Heavenly Thunder rumbles low,\nDivine Thunder roars aloud.\nDragon Thunder stirs the waters,\nWater Thunder churns the waves.\nEarth Altar Spirit Thunder-Fire—\nThunderbolts clash and crash.\nWith one divine mechanism unleashed,\nDemonic essences are slain.\nThe Emperor’s decree descends—\nFire-haste, obey the command!\nBlack fire surges,\nFire-lightning blazes bright.\nSpiritual hail descends, thunder’s might erupts.\nWind and rain crush the host of demons,\nThe ten thousand spirits bow in submission—mountains crumble.\nBy decree, dispatch the Dragon Division’s Yaksha, Red Heaven’s Shouter.\nBy decree, dispatch the Dragon of *Qian*, Blazing Fire, Horizontal Sky Tyrant—\nStand before me at once, hasten to obey the talisman!*\n\nThe adept activates the Thunder Formation, visualizing kidney-water ascending from the *Weilü*, passing through the spine, piercing the *Niwan*, irrigating the Heart Palace, dousing the heart-fire.

Thrice recite the incantation while visualizing the marshal stationed in the Central Palace. Then recite the *Taiyi Han Zhen* incantation of the Great Marshal, and behold the marshal emerge from the adept’s crown to stand before them, awaiting orders.\n\nUpon completion of the incantation, merge all into a single invocation. Activate the Thunder Formation and project it before you, ready for use at will. Alternatively, infuse the talisman with spirit—exhale a breath of qi upon it, and the marshal too shall transform into qi. Thereafter, the marshal will no longer be visible; only a ball of fire remains, which the adept absorbs into the heart.\n\nTo dispatch the marshal:\nGrasp the Thunder Formation with both hands, stand erect, and draw kidney-water up the spine to the *Niwan*. The heart-fire blazes ever brighter. Direct the formation to channel water to douse the vermilion heart-fire in the Crimson Palace. Water and fire clash with a resounding roar. Rotate the formation externally beside both ears to amplify the force. Let the eyes flash as lightning, and the formation strike as thunder. Thunderbolts fill the sky, merging with the marshal into a single entity.\n\nRecite the incantation:\n*Mighty spirits of the Law,\nTaiyi containing the True.\nFive chariots, eight steeds,\nThunder and lightning topple all.\nThe Supreme Emperor decrees—\nAid this body of mine.\nGolden light bursts as lightning,\nSwiftly manifest your true form.\nDare you defy or delay,\nCalamity shall befall you.*\n*Hasten, hasten, by the decree of the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven!*\n\nThe marshal verifies the talisman and secret incantation:\n*By command, Swift Fire, Horizontal Sky Tyrant, appear at once!*\n\n*One begets one, one begets two,\nTwo beget three, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning governs all.\nOne begets one, one begets two,\nTwo beget three, the Great Spirit Deng Xie governs all.*\n\nRecite this incantation thrice in silence, and the spirit shall descend.\n\nThe heart incantation of the great spirit:\n*Celestial Sovereign Jiaye, seize with thunder!*\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s verification secret incantation:\n*Chi qian yin tang □ yin he □ yin tu kua yin gu song yin ce zhi yin zhao □ yin □ □ yin ding □ yin ru □ yin xiao zhui yin zhui hui yin hui □ yin qi □ yin qiu kou yin kou xie yin chui zhi □ yin jin □ yin zheng □ yin dang seize.*\n\nTo deploy the talisman in the Dipper Formation, inscribe the six characters, then write with the Jade Emperor’s verification incantation. Anoint the character for thunder with the marshal’s secret words. This is the Jade Emperor’s talisman for summoning Swift Fire in its true form.\n\nSecret concealment of thunder essence:\nWhen invoking for rain, first touch the tip of the tongue to Penglai Mountain, channeling the waters of the Celestial River. Then recite the Purification of the Altar incantation:\n\n*The Central Mountain’s divine incantation,\nThe Jade Text of Primordial Beginning.*\n\nRecite once, and demons shall be repelled.\n\nTo Prolong Life:\nTraverse the Five Marchmounts, let the Eight Seas bear witness. Demon kings bow their heads, guarding my chariot. Malevolence and filth dissolve and disperse, the Dao’s qi endures forever.\n\nThe ritual master forms the Thunder Formation with the left hand, assumes the Sword Mudra with the right, and rests it at the waist. Settling into stillness, they recite the Golden Light Incantation. Upon completion, they visualize golden light pervading heaven and earth, this body and all beyond suffused with radiance.\n\nNext, they intone:\nBy the Jade Emperor’s oral command, the host of perfected beings enact the Dharma.\nAbove the nine heavens of Qian, five-colored auspicious clouds arise.\nIn Kan, golden light intertwines, illuminating Qian and Kun.\nIn Gen, evil spirits and demons are extinguished, all spirits subdued.\nIn Zhen and Xun, doors shatter swiftly—soar with the Dipper, visualize golden light bursting open the Thunder Citadel. Thunderous annihilation of wicked essences.\nThe Three Realms heed the decree, the Nine Bureaus take note.\nLi’s Primordial Sovereign of True Prosperity, swiftly manifest in true form.\n\nForm the central formation, and as it takes shape, visualize as the incantation declares:\n*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ. Baza baga ma śrī jili śun ti oṃ bodhaye ga makā ga huo zhī huo bō huo lún pán pán ga lǜ tái tái shěn shěn zhū zhū bái líng hé hù dì zhā zhā pó tuī hē jīn tóu bīn nà guō jí diāo zhēn rú dì wēi shā sān mèi wū jīng huǒ ní dì niè dì hē gōu ní gōu ní pó sū zhā hē.*\n\nAt the first strike, the thunder chariot arises; at the second (zi), lightning flashes; at the third (wei), a resounding crash; at the fourth (wu), the earth quakes; at the fifth (yin), sand flies and stones hurtle; at the sixth (chen), a raging tempest and mighty thunderclap erupt. At si, swiftly unleash fire—execute with haste.\n\nDecree: Heavenly Thunder roars, Chen’s Spirit Thunder roars, Mao’s Dragon Thunder roars, Yin’s Water Thunder roars, Chou’s Earth Spirit Thunder roars.\n\nAt zi: Form the Thunder Formation with the left hand, assume the Sword Mudra with the right. Visualize the Six Stars, channel primordial qi from the eyes’ light, inscribe the Qian trigram, and with the Sword Mudra, cleave it asunder. See golden light erupt from the earth; with the sword, direct it upward to burst open the Xun gate. The Six Stars vanish—only the messenger remains by the sixth star, a small star at its side.\n\nChannel the waters of the Celestial River into the talisman in one motion. Circulate ancestral qi to the tongue’s tip, press the tongue to the upper palate, merging the two qi there. With the *chui* character, project it before the face, briefly holding the visualization. Glare fiercely, recite the Sixteen-Character Incantation, and behold the messenger transform into true form, filling the void.\n\nThe Sixteen-Character Incantation:\n*Oṃ lī hūṃ oṃ, lī hūṃ lī hūṃ. Oṃ oṃ lī oṃ, oṃ lī hūṃ hūṃ.*\n\nInscribe the talisman and circulate the golden light to form the Eight Trigrams array. The paper becomes heaven and earth, within which the messenger appears, its form like the talisman itself, golden radiance illuminating heaven and earth. With the brush, inscribe the talisman in a single breath, then add the Nine-Character Thunder Seal.\n\nFor rain prayers, write the sun’s taboo name first, then the moon’s, and below inscribe the *zuān* character. For clear skies, write the moon’s taboo name first, then the sun’s, and below inscribe the *huáng* character. To exorcise ghosts, add the Big Dipper’s taboo name to the sun and moon, and below the Dipper’s *qi*, inscribe the *huáng* character.\n\n**Rain Summons in Practice**\nFirst, transform into the deity. Step through the [missing characters] Dipper, visualizing each step ignite sparks of fire in all directions, pervading the dharma realm—all six stars thus. Upon completing the steps, retreat to stand on the fifth star, plant the sword upon the sixth star, and burn the summons to command the messenger. Circulate the waters to bring rain, visualizing the Celestial River’s surging flow, the messenger driving the heavenly chariot, drawing the river’s waters as rain.\n\n**Messenger Talisman**\nFace the Big Dipper’s direction to circulate the transformative powers. Invoke the general into the brush, secretly recite the Sixteen-Character Incantation, and circulate primordial *qi* to form the character upon the paper. Once the talisman’s shape is complete, inscribe the command. Conclude with a yellow character, visualizing golden light filling the talisman. See the small star beyond the sixth star of the Southern Dipper emit golden light, its radiance meeting the chaotic white jade light—when the two merge, they suddenly burst open. Then behold the messenger. Again circulate ancestral *qi* and draw it into the talisman.\n\n**Talisman-Inscribing Oral Formula**\nFirst, use the Sixteen-Character Incantation to form the talisman. Draw the Kan and Li trigrams over fire, then inscribe the sun and moon symbols above the trigrams. For clear skies, use the Big Dipper’s incantation to smear the Li trigram, drag it downward to the Kan trigram, and anchor it, driving ancestral *qi* straight into Li to emerge. Next, inscribe the clear-sky command, smear it with the incantation, and conclude with a yellow character to seal it. For rain, reverse the process; for exorcism, use the neutral method. Still visualize the messenger entering the talisman, golden light filling it. Then seal it with the Dipper’s *qi*, as one black divides into three. First inscribe your own command at the top. When burning the talisman, circulate the transformation, visualizing the *chì* character in the sky to hasten it. For rain, smear it with the Wooden Youth incantation; for clear skies, smear it with the Great Awesome Virtue incantation.\n\n[Missing characters] for rain.\n[Missing characters] for clear skies.\n[Missing character] for exorcism.\n[Missing character] to shield the body.\n[Missing characters] to cure pestilence.\n[Missing characters] to lash dragons: use rooster’s blood, realgar, and cinnabar to inscribe upon an iron tablet.\n\n**Obscuring Sunlight in Practice**\nRecite the Jade Emperor’s command to harness transformative power. With the tongue, inscribe it upon the upper palate, exhale into a water vessel, then recite the following incantation. Inhale the Dipper’s crimson *qi*, spray it toward the sunlight to instantly darken it, and with the eyes’ light, trace the design.\n\n**Netherworld Incantation**\n*Taiwei* Divine Youth, command: *Oṃ chè lī svāhā.*\n\n*Oṃ* Rāhu-Ketu, Earth Mansion—seize and bind.\n\n*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls*, Scroll 26, #1: *\"Tactics for Commanding Earth Deities and Mysteries of the Celestial Bureau\"*\nTransmitted by the Divine Empyrean lineage.\nThe *Anthology of Daoist Methods* (Scrolls 125–128) includes *\"The Great Thunder Rites of the Nine Provinces’ Earth Deities,\"* *\"The Yang-Thunder Rites of the Nine Provinces’ Earth Deities,\"* and *\"Documents for Yang-Thunder Invocations of the Nine Provinces’ Earth Deities,\"* all belonging to the same doctrinal tradition and serving as corroborative references.\n\n*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls*, Scroll 27: *Secret Writings from the Family Letters of the Master of the Golden Watchtower*\n\n**Summoning, Assembling, Dispatching, and Dismissing**\nLight incense, transform into the deity, pace the Dipper’s *qi*-path, form the Jade Seal with the left hand and the Sword Seal with the right, strike the command three times, then summon the generals.\n\nA single stick of precious incense—\nthe Ten Directions stand purified.\nThree rolls of the Dharma drum—\nthe myriad spirits all attend.\n\nBy this burning incense, I hereby invoke and summon the Four Direct Merit-Officials of the Dark Heavens—Chen, Liu, Sun, and Zhang—and the great marshals and generals of the Thunder Bureau of Rectified Law.\nHear this summons and descend with utmost haste!\n\nSpirits of the Dark Heavens,\nmight of the Four Direct Officers—\ndescend to this altar ground\nand heed the commands to be executed.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes of the Supreme Emperor decree!*\n\nWith reverence, I summon the Four Great Envoys of the Dark Heavens—Chen An, Liu Ji, Sun De, and Zhang Jing—to descend with utmost haste.\n*By the command of the Dark Heaven Supreme Emperor.*\n\nClasp the Zi mudra with the right hand, blow upon the incense smoke with northern qi, then silently recite the Tianpeng Mantra once before summoning again.\n\nBy decree, I summon the Four Direct Merit-Officials of the Dark Heavens—Chen An, Liu Ji, Sun De, and Zhang Jing—and the Four Great Envoys.

Recite the sacred title of the Golden Watchtower’s transformed body and inscribe the talisman. The talisman should be five *cun* square, measured by the standard rule. According to the four seasonal incantations for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, write the petition talisman in ink on the reverse and in cinnabar on the front, then seal the back with cinnabar while reciting the incantation. The petition talisman must be inscribed on the back of the main talisman, though it should not be too large. Write: “On such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour, dispatched from such-and-such a place, divined to receive a response on such-and-such a month, day, and hour—how the report shall manifest. Awaiting the master’s decree, so-and-so bows in reverence.”\n\nFor exorcising malevolent spirits or dismantling shrines, use black paper with cinnabar script. For praying for rain, use blue paper with cinnabar script, or yellow paper with cinnabar or ink script. For praying for clear skies, use red paper with cinnabar script. The talisman’s efficacy awaits a response within two hours—if sent at *chen*, expect a reply by *wu*.\n\n**When submitting a petition for the household:**\nClasp the Dipper Mudra with the left hand, from *zi* to *wu*, and visualize a red light rising from the heart. Then flick the mudra, directing it straight toward the Celestial Gate in the north, imagining the red light extending from the altar to the gate, boundless across ten thousand *li*. The Four Direct Messengers stand before the petitioner, one holding the household petition in hand, while the officials of the ritual register follow behind. Together, they ascend upon the red light.\n\nAfter a while, a long bridge appears, its fine rays shimmering. Crossing it, they continue forward on the red light until, in an instant, a twelve-tiered golden tower comes into view. Ascending its steps, they ride the red light onward, passing a crimson bridge before reaching the Jade Watchtower of the Central Heaven, its paths wreathed in clouds and mist.\n\nUpon entering the watchtower’s base, the officials of the ritual register and the accompanying generals remain below to await. Only the Four Direct Messengers enter the gate, turning right toward the Hall of the Protective Sage. There, the gates are heavily guarded, with officials, generals, and thunder deities arrayed in formation. Entering, the Four Direct Messengers present the household petition to the True Officer of Memorials. The officer receives it with joy, bowing in reverence, and leads the petitioner straight to the palace steps. After nine prostrations, ascend the left dragon-tail staircase to the hall. Kneel before the imperial desk and present the petition as desired.\n\nWhen finished, descend the left dragon-tail staircase, perform nine prostrations in gratitude, and depart directly to the gate. There, the Four Direct Messengers await, leading the Demon-Quelling Generals and their retinue of officers and soldiers back to the Jade Watchtower of the Central Heaven. The officials of the ritual register, overjoyed, and the celestial generals escort the petitioner along the original path back to the altar.\n\nFinally, visualize the red light returning to the heart like a ball of fire. Strike the teeth together three times, swallow saliva three times, and withdraw.\n\n**Characters to avoid in household petitions:**\n*Qi* (乞), *zhong* (仲), *xia* (瞎), *zei* (贼), *chen* (陈), *fang* (方), *gao* (告), *jinming* (进明).\nDo not use these in pairs.\n\n**Dispatching the household petition and sending forth the generals.**\n\nThe undersigned, reverently upholding the Emperor’s mandate, holds the seal and talismans, wielding the authority of thunderous commands and adjudicating the merits and demerits of ghosts and spirits.

The Wind Chariot’s appointed messenger will then appear.\n\nFirst visualize the □ character within, then envision the messenger riding the wind chariot, assuming the form of a tiger, wielding an iron whip in one hand while the other executes the Mudra of the Thunder Formation. Cry out: *Chì zǐ zhà yín dāng xùn lù kūn zhū.* The Execution Text is drawn forth—imagine the messenger lashing the tiger, a great roar rising with the wind. Inhale to the right, exhale to the right, shaping the sound of the two characters in the mouth. Inscribe them upon both palms, then rub the hands together three times. From the *xun* direction, dispatch the wind, and with the *huan* character hasten it. Inscribe the Golden Light Mantra in the void, then drive it forth with lung *qi*. Employ the Mudra of Command, visualizing this character at the Dipper’s mouth, directing the messenger to swiftly raise the *xun* wind—or the wind of any specified direction. To invoke rain, summon the *qian* direction’s wind; the *xun* wind must not be used.\n\nOnce the wind responds, direct it toward tall trees or dense forests, guiding it with intent. Test it upon a candle flame to reverse its course. Align the mechanism, radiance, balance, and guardian script—command the myriad spirits, subdue and seize.\n\n**Method for Gathering Clouds to Obscure the Sun**\nThe practitioner holds a bowl toward the sun and inscribes the character for \"sun\" within it, followed by the sun’s taboo name. With the *qi* of *Luohou*, the Earthly Mansion, calculate the celestial degrees and seal its light. Recite the *Luohou* Mantra:\n\n*Taiwei* Divine Youth, by edict.\n**Oṃ chè lī suō hē.**\n**Oṃ luó hòu jì dū tǔ xiù shè.**\n\nAgain inscribe the five characters, summoning scorching black winds. Visualize black clouds swirling to obscure the great sun. The practitioner’s heart must shine with the sun’s brilliance—circulate black *qi* upward along the spine, then swallow it to encircle the sun. Once accomplished, invert the bowl upon the altar’s earth. Then activate the five characters to stir heaven and earth, commanding the spirits with a shout to veil the sunlight.\n\n**Celestial Golden Script’s Secret Designation**\nThis talisman is called the *Jade Script*, its hidden intonations serving as the thunder’s pledge. On a *jiǎzǐ* day or at dawn on the *bǐngwǔ* day of one’s natal year, visualize this talisman as golden radiance descending from the Gate of Heaven. Inhale it into the mouth, suffusing the entire body until no other hue remains—only the talisman. Then recite the *Heavenly Thunder’s Distant Clarity Edict* without counting repetitions, swallowing saliva three to five times. Let one’s perfected self guard it, practicing this daily.\n\nWhen inscribing talismans, infuse the brush with *qi*. Upon completion, visualize the prior talisman entering the new one, silently tracing it upon the talisman’s body.\n\n**Six-One Grandson Envoy’s Celestial Joy Divine Talisman**\n*Open the Gate of Heaven, seal the Door of Earth, bar the Human Portal, block the Demon’s Path, pierce the demon’s heart, rupture the demon’s belly.*\nThe Five Virtues of Metal, Earth, Water, Fire, and Wood—Five Venerable Stars—are deployed by generation and conquest.\n*Greed, Vastness, Prosperity, Literature, Integrity, Martiality, Destruction...*\n**Left:** Lord of the Great Yang\n**Right:** Lord of the Great Yin\n*Child-Sin, Child-Tiger, Child-True, Child-Pity, Child-Favor, Child-Wu, Child-Geng—inscribe Sun Green’s entry.*\n\n**Left:** *Qingyang* Envoy\n**Right:** *Tuoluo* Envoy\nBy the edict of *Tianyi* and *Taiyi*, summon the Five Thunders to instantly arrive at the altar. Next, visualize the envoy: head crowned with a curved-horned cap, forehead bound in yellow, face the hue of jujube, three-fanged beard, yellow robe, golden armor bared at the chest, holding a banner in both hands, black boots with upturned soles. Descend from the *xun* palace into the talisman. Upon completion, add the reverent *Baolun* seal and inscribe the five characters at the talisman’s core.\n\n**Summoning Incantation**\nI gird the stellar *gang* and emerge from the *xun* gate,\nBlack winds and dark clouds shroud heaven and earth.\nLightning and fire merge—dimness then clarity,\nThe Nine Palaces offer no path for escape.\nMighty deities and fierce officers govern the thunder,\nThunder commands me to drive out demonic spirits.\nDemons slain, heaven and earth brighten,\nReturning to my body’s fivefold gods.\nAll spirits converge with my heart,\nCelestial and terrestrial spirits—I too am numinous.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*\n\n**Swift Fire’s Concealment Directions**\n*Jiǎ* in *kūn*, *yǐ* in *yǒu*, *bǐng* in *hài*,\n*Dīng* seeks the Rat, *jǐ* the Ox—opposing palaces.\n*Wù* seeks the Boar, *gēng* in *yín*,\n*Xīn* toward *mǎo*, *rén* in *sì*.\n*Guǐ* roams the South chasing the Horse,\nOpposing directions conceal—no other way.\nDetermine the flying and hiding positions to fix their stay,\nThe immortal elder gains this as a fine strategy.\n\n**Severing and Verifying the Mysterious Secret**\n**Transformation Spirit Incantation**\n\n**The Celestial August Emperor** swiftly transforms into his true form.\nSummon the Six *Jiǎ* on the left, the Six *Dīng* on the right.\nThe Three Origins align as one, the Five Thunder Great Spirits—\nThe Dao shines afar, the Dharma flourishes in due time.\nEighty-four thousand guardian spirits and men,\nHasten to descend into my body, and the Great Dao arises of itself.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*\n\nFor the right method: visualize the vastness of the Dharma-body.\nAtop the crown are six characters, the Celestial August’s taboo name: *Xuan-Yi-Kuang-Mi-Xu-Jing*.\nEnvision golden light, then with both hands form the sword mudra,\nSlash open the facial skin, and visualize the body as Mount Kongtong.\nBehold the Heavenly Gate where a true person stands,\nClad in crimson robes with voluminous sleeves, in the likeness of a *Zhengyi* true person,\nBoth hands wielding thunder axes, entering this mountain.\nThe adept’s body becomes the Thunder King of All.\nDraw the *qi* of *xùn* and blow it to left and right,\nBehold the Six *Dīng* and Six *Jiǎ* thunder spirits encircling to cure illness.\n\n**Supplementary Incantation:**\nThe thunder’s roar resounds mightily, aiding the ailments within my body.\nThunder seizes demonic spirits, and upright *qi* returns to my breast.\nThe five viscera and their five spirits are entrusted to me.\nThe true *qi* of the Five Thunders flows into my body’s palace.\nThe Three Clarities pour forth their blessings,\nMy name recorded in the highest heavens.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*\n\nSummon the messengers: step the Wind-Fire Commanding *Gāng*,\nVisualize the messenger’s arrival, step the Wind-Thunder Drum-Dance *Gāng*,\nThen merge *qi*, and visualize their presence.\n\n**Summoning Xīn Heavenly Lord Ruǎn:**\nSilver-fanged fierce officer, styled Han Minister.\nEyes flash with lightning, fangs gleam like silver.\nSoaring through the Golden Gates, his might shakes a thousand spirits.\nAt my command’s call, swiftly emerge from *xùn*’s city.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*\n\n**Summoning the Five Messengers:**\n**Eastern Green Thunder Messenger Jiǎng:**\nYellow turban, green face, green robe, booted, holding a wind wheel.\n**Southern Fire Thunder Messenger Bì:**\nYellow turban, red face, red robe, booted, wielding a sword and fire pearl.\n**Western Mountain Thunder Messenger Huá:**\nGreen turban, white face, white robe, booted, holding an axe.\n**Northern Water Thunder Messenger Léi:**\nDisheveled hair, black face, black robe, treading waves, holding a water wheel.\n**Central Earth Thunder Messenger Chén:**\nDaoist crown, eel’s head, yellow face, Daoist robes, wielding a sword.\n\n**Five Thunder *Gāng* General Summoning Incantation:**\nSlay and verify, Thunder Duke;

Keep it secret.\n\n**Mysterious Essence of the Nine Dippers**\n**Secret Incantation:**\nWind, fire, thunder, lightning, and the thunderbolt—seize and behead demons.\n*Demon* may be replaced with *essence-corrupting malevolence, shamans, pestilence, or ghostly qi.*\nFire bells, tridents, *Ya*, *Chi Bi*, *Tan Lang*—seize.\nSi, Wu, Mao, Shen, You, Hai, Zhong, Liang, Zi.\nHeaven, Earth, Sun, Moon, Stars, Lightning, Immortal *Xie*, Thunderbolt—*Bing* and *Ding* seize.\n\n**Diagram of the Big Dipper’s Configuration**\nThis method structures the Five Thunder Fire Formation. Next, press the *Si* character, summoning wind and fire to pervade the ten directions and survey the boundaries of heaven and earth. Visualize clouds as an iron net to capture and restrain malevolent spirits. Press the *Sha* character and reform the formation.\n\nNext, visualize heart-fire flowing throughout the world. Recite the following six-character incantation to gather and restrain all obstinate malevolence, the Five Penetrations, and spirits that bring misfortune. Tread upon them beneath the left foot, beneath the *Kui* and *Gang* stars. Remain motionless and inactive, reducing them to fine dust.\n*Swift, swift!* As the decree commands to restrain and subdue.\n\nWith both hands, form the Thunder Formation and strike it into the *Kui*, *Gang*, and Golden Well.\n\n**Six-Character Secret Incantation for Seizing Malevolence:**\n*Swiftly seize, swiftly drag, swiftly shackle, swiftly restrain, swiftly behead, swiftly annihilate.*\n\nThis method is most secret. Internally, it is transmitted to lineal disciples; externally, to sincere and devoted disciples. Only after making vows before the myriad heavens may it be imparted.\n\n**Fire Bells and Refinement Practices**\nThe adept visualizes within the Yellow Gate and Purple Portal, beneath the Flowery Canopy, nine luminous stars, each roughly an inch long. Within the Dipper, the Three Terraces lie horizontally at its head: the Upper Terrace aligns with *Xuan* Star, the Middle Terrace with the center of the hairline, and the Lower Terrace with the crown of the head.\n\nThree Terrace Immortals, clad in yellow robes and yellow crowns, emerge. The Three Terrace Stars emit fiery light, within which stand two spirits, each roughly three inches tall, three feet from the face. Both wear red robes and crowns, each holding fire bells. Their radiance spans ten thousand *zhang*.\n\nAfter a long while, one of the Three Terraces’ yellow lights enters the Dipper from three directions. The yellow light from the Gate and Portal enters, suffusing the five viscera. The two luminous essence-spirits, now transparent and fiery, return to reside before the heart. They exhale fire, coiling it threefold around the body. Hold the breath, burning the body until it becomes thoroughly heated. Then exhale, click the teeth nine times, and the fire disperses into golden light. The spirit transforms into a nine-foot form, wielding flowing-gold fire bells, ever attendant at one’s left and right.\n\nVisualize the body as the color of fine jade. The Terraces and Dipper follow the establishment of the method.\n\nThus, after one year, one repels misfortune; after two years, one repels weapons; after three years, one becomes deathless. The face radiates purple light, and the body resides unburned within fire. After nine years, yin dissipates and yang flourishes, and one ascends through the smoke.\n\nPractice this visualization daily.\n\nWhen inscribing talismans for refinement, first visualize the body as prescribed. Only then begin inscribing the talisman.

Form the Thunder Formation with both hands, face the southeast, and visualize the Thunder Sound Universal Honored One within a nine-colored halo. Clad in crimson robes, draw nine breaths of golden light-*qi* through the nose, swallowing them into the heart. Visualize the Universal Honored One entering one’s numinous viscera, then transform into the Universal Honored One.

By the Law Command of the Highest Divine Empyrean True King.*\n\n**Inner Recitation Formula of the Divine Empyrean**\nThe Realized One acts as before, entering the Three Heavenly Gates, proceeding directly to the southeast, the august Xun position. Amidst verdant forests and azure mists, cascading streams swirl—there stands a grand palace, the abode of the Great Emperor of Longevity. The guards are arrayed in solemn formation, as in the Great Mystery’s court.\n\nThe Realized One, from the Crimson Palace, ascends the layered towers, crosses the rainbow bridge, and enters the Central Heavenly Gate. Passing through the Three Heavenly Gates, he beholds the towering palace halls, golden tablets and jade inscriptions proclaiming the *Divine Empyrean Jade Treasury*. The Realized One then enters to pay homage and recite the scripture, whether for others or himself. After reciting the scripture seven times, he repents of sins and prays for blessings as before. Bowing twice, he takes leave, exiting the Three Heavenly Gates, crossing the rainbow bridge, descending the layered towers, and returning to the Crimson Palace, where he swallows saliva to conclude.\n\nThe recited scripture is the *Divine Empyrean’s Jade Chapters*.\n\n**Silent Audience Formula of the Divine Empyrean**\nFor the silent audience, proceed to the Three Heavenly Gates marked by golden tablets and jade inscriptions. Do not enter this gate; instead, face the southeast and pay homage to the Divine Empyrean’s palace. Donning red robes, recite the Feathered Chapters. Visualize the True King and the host of Realized Ones on his left and right, all chanting in unison the True King’s golden radiance of right qi, merging with one’s body. Then bow deeply or kneel to present the petition.\n\nIf seeking rain, request the descent of a certain general to bring rain, and await the imperial assent. If intending to pay homage at the Golden Palace, take leave of the True King and return directly to the Three Heavenly Gates. Declare the matter to the guardian officials as prescribed, recite the middle chapter, present the petition, and await the decree.\n\nOnce the Celestial Emperor has granted the imperial edict, summoning the Divine Empyrean, the True King is seen facing the palace to receive the Celestial Emperor’s mandate, dispatching thunder to bring rain. The True King, bearing the command, exits the Three Heavenly Gates. The practitioner follows the True King out, witnessing him summon the Three Marshals, Five Generals, and all Thunder Gods. The True King orally transmits the Celestial Emperor’s decree: “Due to prolonged drought in such-and-such a place, you, the Thunder Gods, are commanded to bring rain to relieve the drought.” Immediately, clouds gather, lightning flashes, thunder roars, and rain descends.\n\nWhen the rain is sufficient, the True King again pays homage at the Golden Palace to express gratitude before withdrawing. The Realized One likewise expresses gratitude and returns to the Crimson Palace, following the usual procedure. If not paying homage at the Golden Palace, the True King is still seen arriving at the Three Heavenly Gates to summon thunder and bring rain, after which the usual procedure is followed.\n\nThe heavens comprise Nine Empyreans, with the Divine Empyrean at the center. Its scenery is of azure cinnabar, turquoise, and purple jade. The Supreme Emperor resembles the Supreme Clarity’s form. The Thunder City lies at the southeast corner.\n\n*Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Twenty-Nine—Concluded*\n*Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Thirty*\n\n**Secret Method of the Great Year for Excavation Talismans**\n\nThe Heavenly Master said: In worldly construction, those who violate taboos and die number eight or nine out of ten. The Dharma holds the incantation for excavation, corresponding to the five surnames’ households. If one violates the earth and contracts illness, no medicine can save them. Submit a written petition, then take a peach-wood board nine *cun* long and one *cun* five *fen* wide, tapering from top to bottom. Inscribe the talisman upon it, perform the ritual as prescribed, and install it at the afflicted site. Only afterward may talismanic water be administered for ingestion, ensuring immediate recovery. This must not be recklessly transmitted.\n\nWhen inscribing the talisman, arrange an incense altar, pace the *Ding*-steps, transform the spirit, and summon the generals, stating the matter at hand. Now inscribe the celestial talisman in seal script, dispatching it to the household to expel all malevolent spirits and deities, pacifying the residence so the afflicted may recover. Strike the brush five times, then inscribe the talisman:\n\n*Upper Terrace: One yellow, pine repels misfortune (巳)\nMiddle Terrace: Two white, protects the body and secures the home (午)\nLower Terrace: Three azure, extinguishes calamity and eliminates spirits (未)\nWhere the Terrace Stars arrive, great might is bestowed*\n\n*\"I, in service to the Supreme Emperor, beseech the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, the great deities of the celestial center, ascending to the Golden Palace to rescue the imperial subjects.

Proceed to the household of so-and-so, expel all malevolent spirits, and suffer no delay! Defiance of the imperial decree shall be met with execution by the Wheel of Law!\"* Only then may the talisman-bearer be instructed to prepare, at the afflicted site, five portions of wine and fruit as offerings to the talisman’s generals, the Year Lord’s honored deities, the Five Thunder Generals, the scribes, and the twenty-four malevolent spirits.

Starting from *hai* in the first month, rotate counterclockwise to the monthly Jupiter station, then add *xu* and rotate clockwise to *chen*—this is the Celestial Stem’s position.\n\n**Volume 32 of *Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls* Concluded #1: *The Four Sage Marshals’ Secret Method of Subduing Demons of the Northern Emperor***\n\nThis method was transmitted by the Northern Emperor lineage of the Tang and Song dynasties. The *Northern Emperor* refers to the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the North Pole. The *Four Sages* are the four great marshals under the Northern Emperor’s command: Marshal Tianpeng, Marshal Tianyu, Marshal Xiangsheng, and Marshal Yousheng. *The Essence of Daoist Methods*, volumes 169 and 170, contains *The Great Method of Subduing Demons of the Four Sages of Huntian Feiti*, which belongs to the same tradition and may serve as a reference.\n\n---\n\n**Volume 33 of *Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls*: *The Lesser Four Sages’ Secret Method Before the Northern Emperor***\n\n**Lineage**\nThe ancestral master is Zhang the Perfected of the Great Cavern of Western Shu.\n\n**Generals**\nThe dedicated general for ritual protection is the Vast Spirit of Awesome Power, the Faceless Great General and Northern Pole Commander-in-Chief, Chen Sheng.\n\nHis face is black, his moon-like eyes gaze upward and are large and round, his teeth remain concealed, his hair is black and stands erect, and he wears a small green headscarf. He is clad in a black robe adorned with circular floral patterns on the shoulders, golden armor on the chest, and holds in his right hand an iron staff and in his left two iron staves. A dragon blade hangs at his side, and he wears a white sash, white trousers, and white gaiters.\n\nThis general is a transformation of the Dark Emperor, who manifested in the world during the late Qin and early Han dynasties. Indignant at the cruelty of the age and grieving over the suffering of the times, he resolved to save the people. Leading an army of a million, he commanded all who followed him, and the realm responded like clouds gathering and echoes resounding. His authority was well-regulated, his commands timely, and his purpose was to deliver and aid all living beings. Upon the fulfillment of his merit and deeds, during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, he revealed his traces and assisted in the celestial battles, earning merit. A temple was established for him, and he was enfeoffed as a general to harmonize and govern the common people.\n\nIn various ritual traditions, there is also a Faceless General. However, this general was known by Master Zhang of the Great Cavern, who understood his whereabouts and memorialized the Northern Pole, leading the troops to return to the altar. All who receive this method must revere and keep it secret; its efficacy will surely manifest. It must not be recklessly transmitted to unworthy persons.\n\nThis general communicates directly with the Northern Pole. For all prayers and petitions, the divine response is swift.\n\nThe next general is the Great General of Illuminating the Dao, Shedding Blood at the Head, and Assisting the Numinous, Hao Guang.\n\nHis face is red, his eyes round, his large teeth bared, and his red hair stands erect. He wears a small topknot, a half-black robe of a pale black hue, and golden armor on his chest. In his right hand, he wields a long blade, and in his left, he carries a ghost-headed sword. He wears a blood-red sash, a scabbard at his side, white trousers tucked up, and white gaiters.\n\nThis general is the spirit of the Mighty Celestial Guard. His nature is fierce and detests evil; he executes gods, kills demons, and metes out the harshest punishments. His divine power is resplendent, and he pursues mountain spirits, bringing them back to the true Dao. He transforms and guides the multitudes, and his merit is vast and profound.\n\nThis general also appears in other ritual traditions and is included in the registers of the Three and Five Capital Offices. However, in this altar tradition, he was transmitted by Master Zhang of the Great Cavern of Shu, who understood his essential principles and memorialized for his promotion. All who practice this method can surely subdue ghosts. If one venerates and honors him, how can his manifestations not be evident?\n\nThe Valiant and Mighty General in Golden Armor, Geng Rong, styled Shu Jie, has a face of ruddy jade complexion. His eyes gaze upward, his hands are clenched in fists crossed before him, and his entire body is clad in fine golden armor. He wears a helmet, a blade hangs at his waist, and a small golden sash binds his waist. His feet are bare. This general hails from the land of Chu. King Xian of Wei enfeoffed him as Grand Marshal of the Armies. His nature is upright and stern, detesting evil; he wields both authority and power, commands and subdues, and executes with decisive action. Skilled in leading troops into battle, he has rendered meritorious service time and again. King Xian issued an edict commanding him to lead the army, where he faced the Three-Battle Jiang Jie King of Wuya, dividing his forces to array in formation. Alone, he clapped his hands and charged into battle, yet suddenly, amidst the ranks, he perished in the fray, his qi spent. He vowed to return to the service of the Three Heavens’ Gate, becoming the Golden-Armored Valiant General. Later, Master Zhang of the Great Cavern memorialized his extraordinary valor, and he was appointed to lead troops under the altar’s banner.\n\nThe Manifestly Responsive, Demon-Subduing, Tiger-Headed Primordial Spirit Great General, Geng Wen, styled Zi Ze, wears a tiger crown. His face is half-red, his eyes white. He dons a black robe, holds a blade in his right hand, and lets a white gaiter hang down. His feet are bare, though sometimes he wears hempen sandals. This general is a man of the Tang dynasty. At the Purple Tenuity Grotto and Cloud Palace, he served as the Tiger-Attendant Spirit, originating from the northern lands, where he fed exclusively on termites. His nature is steadfast and gentle, yet when he presented a precious memorial, he was intercepted by a hundred demons. Stirring his courage, he raised his voice to summon the demon-subduing hosts. Thereupon, the Perfected Lord of Demon-Dispelling Celebration descended, leading a myriad of demon-subduing soldiers to serve under him. The demons were thus compelled to submit, and he achieved a minor merit. Unaware of his own resolve, within the Black Yin Zisi Temple, he brandished his blade and split several great beams, chewing through the termites within the wood without number. The temple’s monks entreated him to stay. Wherever the sound of the general’s voice reached within the temple’s halls, termites would take flight and fall dead to the ground. Later, Master Zhang of the Great Cavern memorialized his归附 to the Northern Culmen.\n\nThe talisman of Marshal Chen...\n\n**Summoning Incantation**\nReverently invoke the Great Venerable Deity of the North, styled the Faceless Great General. In his hand he wields an iron staff, interrogating ghosts to reveal their names. The Dark Capital’s Crimson Thearch, his might unheard-of. Grasping the Dragon-Binding Ghost-Subduing Staff, he compels ghosts to swiftly declare their names. By the decree of the Northern Culmen’s Purple Tenuity Great Emperor.\n\n**Descending Incantation**\nMost honored, most great, most sagely, most numinous—\nVast-Spirited General, deliver and succor the common folk.\nHasten, hasten, as the statutes command.\n\n**Secret Incantation**\nOṃ.

Prepare the summons talisman and official writ, and only proceed after the marshal has been duly petitioned.\n\nSelect several pure and upright youths to stand before the altar. Remove all miscellaneous objects from the altar space, lest the marshal’s ferocity damage them—items such as blades and axes must be stored away. Prepare only three peachwood staves, blazing incense, talisman paper and brushes, cinnabar, ink, spirit money, and paper horses to meet the marshal’s needs. At the appointed time, purify the space, transform the spirit, summon the generals, and state your intent as usual.\n\n**Sealing Incantation for Embodiment**\nWhen the ritual master acts, first trace a well-character (井) in the air above the ground, then visualize the character *jīn* (聻) within it. Next, have the youth stand atop the well, imagining it to be ten thousand fathoms deep, with black *qi* billowing forth, engulfing the youth within.\n\nThen, using the sword mudra above the youth’s crown, trace the nine characters of the *guāng yáng chí diān guàn fàn lǎn fú shè* in the air, still visualizing the *jīn* character within the well. Recite the incantation:\n\nThe nine characters shake heaven and earth,\nshaking heaven, the celestial gates turn,\nshaking earth, the terrestrial portals split.\nReverently invoke the Great Star of Fusang, the Seven Ladies of the Eastern Dipper,\nseal the youth, the thousand-mile numinous child,\nthe wondrous sagely divine maidens and warriors—\nhasten the living soul from the body,\nthe divine *qi* to attach to the form.\nUrgent, urgent, as the law commands!\n\nWith this method, visualize the youth’s cinnabar field *qi* rising to the crown, then draw it into your own life palace. Thereafter, perform the ritual actions upon the youth’s face and proceed according to the method.\n\n**Incantation**\nHeaven and earth, sun and moon,\nwater and fire in union.\n\nSummon the upper and lower clouded souls,\nunyielding as iron.\nUrgent, urgent, as the law commands!\n\nWith this method, form the *zi-wu-mao-you* mudra over the youth’s face, then apply the incantation and mudra in sequence.\n\n**Incantation**\nFire and heaven, limpid and profound,\nthe youth’s soul wanders, lost in darkness.\nUrgent, urgent, as the law commands!\n\nAfter reciting this incantation, draw the *qi* of the northern *zi* hour and blow it into the water. Then visualize the water filling with dreadful black *qi*, spray it upon the youth, and imagine the black *qi* shrouding the youth from sight. Next, recite each incantation to hasten the process.\n\n**Swift Elbow Method**\nWhenever a youth’s soul proves difficult to attach, employ this supplementary *elbow talisman method*.\n\n**Talon Talisman (also called the General’s Thunderbolt Talisman)**\n**Incantation**\nBlack *Mo* utters the decree,\nroaring, summoning the Four Upright Ones.\nCommand the Northern Pole General:\nwind and fire descend upon mortal form.\nUnite *qi* to seal the mysterious truth,\nnine talismans in emptiness, one in substance.\nFierce and mighty, manifesting awe-inspiring might,\nvanquish demons, sever black lightning.\nTransmitted by the Great Teaching’s decree,\ndisobedience invites thunderbolt retribution.\nUrgent, urgent, as the law commands!\n\n**Secret Incantation**\nOṃ.\n*Fen fen le le jí jí.*\n\nThis method invokes the command of the Northern Emperor’s incantation and must not be used lightly. If attachment remains elusive after prolonged effort, the master should transform into the Northern Emperor—hair unbound, barefoot—assuming a wrathful countenance. Inscribe this talisman upon a fire dragon, visualize thunder and lightning erupting violently on all sides, and burn a gold coin before the possessed youth. Then, with the sword mudra, trace the talisman in the air while reciting the incantation over the youth’s face to swiftly secure attachment.\n\n**Restraint Method (also called the Hidden *Gang* Method)**\nAfter completing the *gang* steps, form the *zi-wu* mudra, draw the *qi* of the Heavenly Gate, and blow it upon the afflicted person. With the mudra, strike them repeatedly until they collapse. For severe possession, demonic frenzy, or when the youth’s attachment turns unruly and defies control, employ this *hidden gang restraint method*.\n\n**Internal Cultivation Formula**\nAbide in great stillness and silence. Draw a breath of *qi* from the northeast and swallow it into the spleen palace. Next, visualize the black *qi* within the kidneys ascending to the spleen palace, where the two *qi* merge to form a single black orb. Direct it downward into the *Xuanming*, guide it through the *Weilü* point, and ascend straight to the *Niwan* palace. From the Earthly Portal below, exhale a black orb to meet your own, fusing them into one. Swiftly wield the sword mudra or the Dipper mudra to cleave it open, revealing Marshal Chen standing at your side. Then recite the summoning incantation, the secret incantation, and the esoteric incantation. Visualize above the *Xuantian*: Marshal Chen descending from the Northern Pole’s imperial presence, riding golden-black *qi*. Combine the ten-character secret incantation with the mudra to merge them into a single, awe-inspiring force, ready for command and deployment.\n\n**Primordial Supreme Unity’s Divine Thunderbolt Method**\n\n**Sacred Rank**\nThe Most High of Jade Clarity’s Sacred Realm, the Void and Spontaneous Origin, Ancestor of the Myriad Dao, Foremost of All Sages—*Yuanshi Tianzun*.\nThe August Supreme Who Opens Heaven, Wields the Talisman, and Governs the Calendar—*Haotian Yuhuang Shangdi*.\nThe Great Sage of Supreme Unity, the Celestial Mother of the Jade *Qi* Heaven, the Banner Deity and August Star Lord—*Taiyi Dasheng Fanqi Yaotian Yuanhuang Tianmu Daoshenzun Dijun*.\n\nHair unbound, three eyes gleaming gold, bare-chested, left hand holding a severed head, right hand brandishing a sword, feet treading upon numinous energy, mouth exhaling black *qi*.\n\nThe Four Great Divine Lords: *Feilian*, *Fire* [symbol], *Bisu*, and *Jixiu*.\n\n**Commanding Officers**\nChief Marshal Zhu, whose taboo name is *Yu*...\n\n**Commanding Officers (continued)**\n\nChief Marshal Zhu, whose taboo name is *Yu*, wears the *Tianding* crown, dons golden armor, and a crimson robe, wields a sword, and rides a golden dragon.\n\nVice Marshal Zhu, whose taboo name is *Kuang*, wears the *Tianding* crown, dons golden armor, and a black robe, wields a halberd, and rides a black dragon.\n\nVice Marshal Qin, whose taboo name is *Dachun*, dons golden armor and a crimson robe, and rides a *xiezhi*.\n\nVice Marshal Wen, whose taboo name is *Zan*, appears in ghostly form, with ox horns upon his head, left hand holding a water wheel, right hand wielding a sword.\n\n**Incantation:**\nA golden pellet pierces the Purple Tenuity,\nIts full celestial might enters the profound mechanism.\nCaptured lightly in the palm, gently raised—\nThe Six Harmonies and Qian-Kun are held in one’s grasp.\n\n**Invocation (to be recited on the ninth day):**\nThe lunar radiance weaves jade,\nEssence and spirit nurture all life.\nGreen cassia and yellow blossoms assist,\nLush and pure, they guard the numinous.\nStrange forms divide at the hair’s crown,\nComet tails may pass in secret.\nFrom their stations, fortune and misfortune flow—\nThrough fasting and cultivation, the unseen stirs.\n\n**Secret Mantra:**\n□ gaze □ the Great Constancy, urgent.\n\n**Golden Crucible Fire-Agitating Formula**\nWith the right method, draw a well-shaped character (井). Then inhale *qi* through the nose in one breath and swallow it, visualizing lung *qi* entering the kidneys—metal generating water—transforming into the moon. Liver *qi* enters the heart—wood generating fire—transforming into the sun. Visualize the sun descending and the moon ascending, the two poles intertwining and churning, returning to the central earth, merging into a single golden pellet. After a long while, let it ascend straight to the crown of the head, where golden light bursts forth, swirling across the heavens. The adept uses their gaze to gather the sky and earth into one mass, coalescing into a radiant golden-red glow, distinctly above the adept’s head.\n\n**Jade Cauldron Simmering Formula**\nWith the right method, use the moon, always positioned where the *Xu* Dipper points. Visualize *Pojun* as large as the Dipper, its red light like the sun. Use the cauldron to swiftly draw it in and swallow it into the heart, then close and hold. Swallow a mouthful of saliva, sending it to the central palace. Visualize the fire blazing like boiling water, within which the five characters transform, emerging in sequence from behind the adept’s crown into the void to perform their work.\n\n**Three-Character Method**\nFor praying clear skies, brush upward; for praying rain, brush downward.\nFor rain, use the *Zi-Wu* Dipper; for clear skies, use the *Yin-Wu* Dipper.\n\n**Two-Character Living Method**\nThis is the phase of heaven and earth merging—emerging, descending, striking the *Ji* and *Bi* constellations.\nThis is the phase of heaven and earth’s purity and tranquility.\nThe brush’s touch traces the path of the *po*—the symbol of separation between humans and ghosts.\n\n**Tide-Rising Water-Gathering Green Dragon Rolling Formula**\nVisualize liver *qi* entering the heart, merging to form a blue-green dragon. Swallow it into the deep sea, drawing water that surges like a tide, rolling upward into the void, spreading rain everywhere.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*Shui ling ting te luo leng han lu yi qi jiang she.*\n*Bei Ming hei shui xu □ xia jiang she.*\n\n**Tiger’s Roar, Departing Palace Blazing Fire Formula**\nVisualize lung *qi* entering the heart, merging to form a fiery mist.

In his left hand, he holds a thunder wheel; in his right, he inverts a golden spear, standing within firelight.\n\n**Summoning Incantation:**\n*Om.*\n\n**Incantation:**\n*Hūm □ niè hūm dā hūm suō □ ní □ chì zhà suō hē.* (Three times)\n\nAfter reciting the right incantation thrice, exhale the *li* and *zhèn* qi toward the *xùn* direction.

This qi transforms into clouds, exhaled toward the Xun direction. Then, behold the Gen direction where dark clouds gather thickly—suddenly, a great fiery calamity from the Xun direction plummets into Gen. The Marshal swiftly turns toward Xun, where all the thunder spirits assemble, bowing in attendance. The Marshal leads the host of generals to descend, and the practitioner inhales and exhales before the altar.\n\nThis method commands all thunder spirits; it may be employed for great matters but not for trivial ones.\n\n**Incantation for Flying Sword to Sever the Rainbow:**\n*Heavenly hūm □ spirit, xī chēn sāi □.*\n*Lī niè wèi liè, gū hù náo nù □ yīn □ còu □ jìng dàn □, yàn zàn cí □ zhàng □ měng □.*\n*Flying spirits strike and smite, severing the rainbow’s arc.*\n*Divine might pervades the Three Realms—*\n*Hasten, hasten, by decree of the Jade Emperor’s primordial law!*\n\n**Method:**\nWith the left hand forming the jade script mudra and the right hand holding the sword mudra, silently recite the preceding incantation.

Seal and stabilize. Circulate one’s own water and fire until they intermingle and surge forth. Blow into the water vessel, then trace the Zi-Wu Dipper within.\n\nThe adept traces from *si* (巳) to *wu* (午), releasing fire. Visualize a Dipper-sized blaze upon the earth. The adept treads upon the flame, incinerating the body, transmuting into the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.\n\nNext, from the crown’s gate, a divine infant bursts forth. From the space between the infant’s brows, a flame erupts. The adept swiftly draws it into the nostrils, then exhales through the mouth onto the brush.

Use only this talisman to hasten the process. This talisman may also be inscribed with *Fire Dragon Armored Steed* and a spirit-script stroke, then burned for greater efficacy.\n\n**Commanding Thunder Incantation:**\nAh-tan-ti-tan-□-po-ti-tan-□□-sha-li-xiu-li-xiu-ah-po-da-li-lei-ga-po-lü-□-po.\n\nSwiftly summon the Great Thunder, the Second Thunder, the Third Thunder, the Fourth Thunder, the Fifth Thunder to arrive at once.

By the power of my vow and might, may divine force descend. Soaring across the eight directions, come and heed this single clap. Hasten! As the Jade Emperor’s command and the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign’s decree.\n\n**Edict for Issuing Commands:**\nSolemnly, the first thunder shakes heaven, thunder roars and lightning cracks. Swift as lightning through mist, devour demons on sight. You act by the Three Clarities’ mandate; I act by the Jade Emperor’s command to compel and seize. Issue the order, rebuke and dispatch all marshals to action. Blow wind toward the *Xun* direction. Exhale thunder toward the *Zhen* direction.\n\nInhale lightning from the *Li* direction, lashes of the eyes. Exhale rain toward the *Kan* direction. Draw *qi* from the divine direction:\n*Jia-Yi* at *Chen*, *Bing-Ding* at *Mao*, *Wu-Ji* at *Zi*, *Geng-Xin* at *Shen*, *Ren-Gui* at *Wu*.\n\nThe two preceding secret talismans: whenever performing rituals, first inscribe these two talismans onto the memorial document and burn them. Then write two more talismans and burn them at the appointed time to hasten the dispatch of the documents. Place the two great spirit talismans beneath the altar. Invoke the talisman of Marshal Xin, immerse it in the water vessel, spray and sprinkle, and infuse the *qi* of the Celestial Stem into the water.\n\n**Inner Secret of the Heart-Method:**\nWhen performing the Jade Tone Thunder Summoning, employ the preceding method: circulate the fiery *qi* of wrath throughout the body, emanating from the crown to summon two generals. Combine with two generals from the *Xun* direction. Write talismans and recite incantations in a single breath, swiftly and with the force of thunder. Clap the command, shout the rebuke, and act upon the water in the vessel.\n\nFirst, invite the *qi* of fire and water into the vessel—fire first, then water—circulating the fire *qi* to transform it into water *qi*, merging water and fire. Next, infuse the *qi* of the Celestial Stem into the water, stirring it to absorb the water. Spray and sprinkle toward the direction where the thunder deities reside. Clap the command to summon, rebuke, and dispatch them to act. Inscribe talismans according to the day and direction, drawing *qi* to infuse them.\n\nIn this method, first let the fiery light burst forth from your own eyes, transforming into a sudden flame, then into Marshal Xin of Heaven in the void. Next, visualize yourself as Envoy Zhang, transmitting the Jade Emperor’s edict to issue commands. With your right hand, write the character *xu* (虚); with your left, write *zhang* (张). Visualize your wrath as fiery heat, cover your ears with both hands, uniting inner and outer forces so that water stirs and fire ignites.\n\nFirst, take two small sheets of blue paper, write *xu* and *zhang* on each, roll them into pellets, and insert the *xu* pellet into your left ear. Visualize black *qi* emerging from your right ear as rain. Clasp your hands in the thunder formation, grip firmly, gaze with wrathful *qi*, and strike once to issue the command. Use a black banner inscribed with the Northern Dipper, recite *Xin Zhi*, affix seven gold coins, and one great talismanic horse. Write the subsequent talisman on the horse, burn it, and recite the incantation. Open your eyes and mouth, marking them with cinnabar.\n\nThe master says: When the mind stirs, clouds and rain readily gather. One must practice restraint to preserve the spirit-*qi* in its entirety before proceeding. No memorial need be submitted; with a settled mind, the celestial *qi* clears, and clouds cannot coalesce.\n\n**Inner Work of the Mysterious Capital Thunder Hub:**\nEach night at the *Zi* hour, don robe and sit in stillness, banishing all thoughts. Click the teeth, close the eyes, concentrate the spirit, and inwardly visualize the five viscera as chambers of gold and jade. Click the teeth to gather saliva, fill the mouth, and swallow it into the cinnabar field. Swiftly lift the perineum. Repeat this three times nine, until the ninth repetition. Tightly contract the perineum without releasing, sensing the *qi* surge from the earth throughout the body, ascending to the muddy pellet. Visualize yourself as the Cinnabar Prime Lord, riding purple clouds to appear before the Emperor and present your petition. Upon receiving the decree, summon the cloud hosts to descend to the deep sea and draw water. Lift the perineum again, ascending along the spine to Kunlun, then slightly release the perineum. Once the response is received, proceed with the memorial and ritual.\n\n**Rain Response:**\nA sensation like insects crawling on the crown, moving to the forehead and itching—when the aperture itches, clouds and rain arrive. The body itches with steaming heat—thunder and rain approach. The forehead feels cool and damp with sweat—rain is imminent.\n\n**Thunder Response:**\nThe heart startles, the ears ring with thunderclaps, a faint sound lingers above the crown—thunder resounds. *Qi* surges with panting—thunder crashes.\n\n**Clear Weather Response:**\nBody and mind feel cool and clear—clear skies. Heat and dryness—clear weather. Movement above the crown—clear skies.\n\n**Wind Response:**\nThe crown and forehead feel light, cool, and breezy—wind arises.\n\n**Method of the Left and Right Demon-Subduing Marshals Gou Bi of the Thunder Gate: Five Thunder Oral Formula**\n\nRecognize the root of the Primordial Supreme Ultimate,\nThen from the Supreme Ultimate establish Qian and Kun.\nThe dragon calls forth cinnabar fire to descend from the void,\nThe tiger inhales the Yellow River to surge straight upward.\nThe ears blend thunder and wind, opening the Xun gate,\nThe eyes fly forth lightning, shattering the Thunder Gate.\nA single thunderclap leaves no trace to seek,\nThe moon shines on the cold pool, naturally inhaling and exhaling.\n\n**Transformation Mantra**\nOṃ.

Visualize the Yellow Court—the Central Palace—where a distinct clod of yellow earth appears. Tilt the head back, draw the yellow qi of the Central Heaven into the heart through the nose. The heart’s fire ascends to meet it, then is pressed downward by the external yellow qi into the Central Palace. The internal yellow qi rises to meet the fire, generating it. The three qi merge, all becoming yellow qi. Gather and exhale it upward through the mouth, sending it to the Central Heaven, where it coalesces and descends. Inhale it through the nose into the Central Palace.\n\nAgain, mobilize this mass of golden-yellow qi, exhale it forcefully to the earth, dispersing it to fill the cosmos. All persons, self, and things vanish, leaving only thick, abundant yellow qi. With the right hand form the Sword Mudra at the waist, and with the left hand circulate the Thunder Mechanism through the kidneys. Thunder surges from the spine to the ears, cleaving the yellow qi. Flying fire bursts forth, revealing the Marshal within. The adept turns slightly, inhales, and draws the beam of light from the Marshal’s brow into the Cinnabar Field, passing through the coccyx. It merges with the golden light between the two kidneys, then surges up the spine to the Mud Pill, where it transforms into golden light. The adept inhales this golden light through the nose and exhales it to envelop the Marshal.\n\nWhen deploying the Marshal to execute intentions or inscribe talismans, if the refinement is habitual, condense the golden light into a pellet, gradually shrinking it to the size of a star. Inhale it through the nose into the Central Palace. When needed, extract and employ it.\n\n**Summoning Incantation**\nReverently summon the Fierce Marshal of the Year Lord: at the call, hasten to arrive—swift as shooting stars, rapid as wind and thunder. Dispelling clouds, seizing lightning, hurling fire and meteors, the yellow banner leads, the leopard tail follows. The seventy-two seasonal nodes, the twenty-four qi, the twelve prohibitions—malevolent sha take the fore. Encountering demons, sever them by the inch; meeting ghosts, obliterate their forms. Ahead, dispel the Nine Uglies; behind, annihilate mountain sprites. Flying dragons, earthly anomalies—subdue and pacify the Star of Literary Brilliance.

the Zi-Wu Dipper in the void of emptiness. Visualize within your Cinnabar Prime Palace a mass of golden-red light, transforming into the form of a solar wheel. Ascend the layered towers, spread the golden bridge, and rise from the Mud Pill Palace to the Dipper’s mouth. The Demon-Queller Star looms vast, descending to merge with the solar wheel. At their center appears the syllable *hūm*. Suddenly, a streak of silvery-white light from the west pierces the golden-red radiance. Swiftly inhale it into the Heart Palace, hold it briefly, then exhale through the Mystic Gate. The light remains golden-red, filling the cosmos. With your right hand, part it with the sword mudra to reveal Marshal Ma standing upon a wheel of fire, his face green with three eyes.\n\nWhen attending the Dipper, he wears the Golden Heavenly Ding Crown, his hair crimson, clad in a scarlet robe with wide sleeves, sleeves tied with a green immortal sash, and vermilion shoes. When subduing malevolent spirits, he dons an iron helmet, a red headband, a red surcoat, golden armor, a green immortal sash, and green boots. His left hand forms the Dipper Mudra, his right wields a fire sword. A white serpent spits fire from its mouth, fleshy horns grow from his head, and divine officials surround him.

Direct the twin luminaries to shine upon each other, converging at the kidneys, both equally limpid. Raise the murky, black *qi*-water of the kidneys upward, lower the blazing fire of the heart downward. When water and fire meet, circulate the Five Viscera’s five-colored *qi* to intermingle in the Primordial Cavity—the navel—fusing into a single pearl, amber-hued, resplendent in shifting hues. Press it down into the Cinnabar Field and guard it.\n\n**Summoning and Attachment Formula**\nFor operational use, first form the Thunder Bureau with both hands, rub the Kidney Hall, and mobilize thunder to stir the *qi*, rising from either side of the navel like thunder’s roar.\nThe inner pearl of the Cinnabar Field ascends above the navel, revolving like a golden thread piercing the Posterior Heaven. The aperture within the kidneys—this pearl transforms into a golden light, a threefold entity within, leaping and glowing as if about to take flight. From the *Jiāchūn* point, it enters and ascends straight to the Wind Palace, then bursts forth from both eyes as golden light into the incense smoke, resembling a butterfly’s dance.\nThe adept’s gaze, left-turning and right-shifting, fixes clearly upon it.\nNext, take a copper coin, fan, or paper money, clasp it in hand, and envelop it with this *qi*. Transfer it to the spirit-medium’s hands, seeing the threefold entity enter through the medium’s ears, eyes, mouth, and nose.\nRecite the preceding incantations, then use the Thunder Bureau to trace the medium’s face. Blow a mouthful of Northern *qi* upon them. When the medium’s hands grow numb and paralyzed, seize the object from their grasp. Pass it once over the medium’s palm, then recite the Black Wind Incantation, visualizing it entering water.\nWith the left hand forming the Malevolence Talisman and the right the Sword Mudra, inscribe the Nine Characters in the air, swiftly reversing their order. Urgently recite the Roaring Incantation and the Iterative Character Incantation, drawing Northern *qi* to blow into the water. Dip the brush and write, visualizing black water churning, black *qi* billowing.\nNext, lift the medium’s hands, baring their chest. The adept draws Northern *qi* and blows it beneath the medium’s feet, visualizing black *qi* rising in dense swirls to the waist. With the right hand’s Sword Mudra, part the medium’s face. Spray a mouthful of water, issue a command, and shout to the attending officers: bind them in black mist—a small infant appears at the top of the Cinnabar Field within.\nReunite them, visualizing the medium transformed into a ghostly form. If the spirit attaches, command the officers to administer ten lashes, then bind them with crossed restraints. Shout and roar distinctly, interrogating at will.\nTo awaken the soul, recite the *Yóu dǒu* incantation for soul-entry, the Sevenfold Veiling, and spray a mouthful of water. Visualize the ghostly form reverting to the medium’s original appearance. The adept’s left hand forms the Thunder Bureau, circling the medium’s Cinnabar Field seven times, while the right hand’s Sword Mudra rends upward from the Cinnabar Field. Visualize a thunderous roar in the medium’s heart, driving forth a golden orb. The adept inhales from the Cinnabar Field, and the medium’s crown awakens at once.\n\n**The Thirty-Sixth Scroll of *Dharma Pearls from the Ocean of Methods* Concludes**\n*Divine Empyrean Capital Commissioner, Golden Wheel Enforcer Marshal Zhào’s Talismanic Methods: Transmitted by the Orthodox Unity Tradition.*\n\nFrom *The Compendium of Daoist Methods*, Scroll 232, *Secret Methods of the Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar Marshal Zhào*:\n\nMarshal Zhào’s personal name is Lǎng, styled Gōngmíng. A native of Mount Zhōngnán, he withdrew into the mountains during the Qín era to cultivate the supreme Dao. Upon perfecting his merit and conduct, he was summoned by the Jade Emperor’s decree to serve as Vice Marshal of the Divine Empyrean, assuming the offices of Direct Palace General, North Polar Attending Censor, and Supreme Commissioner of Imperial Mandates. Empowered to command the Three Realms, patrol the Five Directions, and oversee the Nine Provinces, he later received another edict to guard the Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar during the Han Ancestral Celestial Master’s refinement of the Great Elixir.\n\nHis powers encompass driving thunder and dispatching lightning, summoning rain and calling winds, eradicating pestilence and severing malevolence, healing illness and averting calamity—none greater than the Marshal’s efficacy.\n\nThe following texts, collected in Scrolls 133, 240, and others of the same compendium—*Secret Methods of Mysterious Altar Marshal Zhào*, *Orthodox Unity Dragon-Tiger Mysterious Altar Golden Wheel Enforcer As-You-Will Secret Methods*, *Orthodox Unity Flying Tiger Supervisor Marshal Zhào’s Secret Methods*, *Orthodox Unity Dragon-Tiger Mysterious Altar Great Method*, *Mysterious Altar As-You-Will Great Method*, *Highest Clarity Harmonious Wonder Dao Illuminating Primordial Five-Thunder Mysterious Altar Great Method*, and *Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar Marshal’s Six Yin Wild-Sleeve Dance Thunder Method*—all belong to the same lineage and may serve as corroborative references.\n\n**The Heavenly Three Wind-Fire Lone Thunder Great Method**: Transmitted by the Orthodox Unity Tradition, this also derives from the lineage of Marshal Zhào Gōngmíng.\n\n**Secret Methods of Thunder, Lightning, and Earth Deities**: Transmitted by the Orthodox Unity Tradition. According to *The Compendium of Daoist Methods*, Scroll 253, *Supplementary Discourse on Earth Deities*:\n\n> The methods of the Earth Deity Bureau originated with the Vacuously Tranquil Celestial Master, then manifested through the transformations of Cave Master Wáng Zōngjìng of Tiānbǎo Cave, Perfected Officer Hào Dàoxiǎn of Qīngchéng, Immortal Liǔ Bóqí of Qīngzhōu, and Perfected Person Zhōng Míng of Guǒzhōu, who successively served as its custodial masters. Later, lineages such as Sū Dàojì’s branch, the Wēnzhōu Orthodox Lineage, Lǐ Péngtóu’s transmission, Guò Yàoqīng’s transmission, and the Xuánlíng Continuation flourished across Jiāng, Zhè, Mǐn, Shǔ, and the Hú-Guǎng regions—so numerous that their names cannot all be recorded. A thousand paths and ten thousand byways branched from a single source.\n\nThese methods thrived during the Sòng and Yuán periods. The texts *Secret Methods for Summoning Wēn Tàibǎo of Mount Dōngyuè* and *Great Method of Earth Deity Marshal Wēn*, collected in Scrolls 254–256 of the same compendium, likewise belong to this lineage and may serve as corroborative references.\n\n**The Thirty-Seventh Scroll of *Dharma Pearls from the Ocean of Methods* Concludes**\n*Purple Empyrean Protector Five-Thunder Black Tiger Marshal Liú’s Methods*\n\n**Commander-in-Chief:** Purple Empyrean Protector, Five-Thunder Black Tiger Marshal Liú, styled Wénxiǎn. His visage is deep date-red, with large phoenix eyes and sparse whiskers. He wears an iron fish-tail crown, a black headscarf, and black wide-sleeved robes, with yellow cuff guards tied at the sleeves and a yellow sash cinching his waist. His white silk trousers are bound at the ankles, and he wears black shoes, gripping his wrists while carrying a short-handled iron mallet. A black tiger attends his side, and reverse flames coil downward from his waist, encircling his body as he rides upon golden flames and fiery clouds. Under his command are the Six Dīng and Six Jiǎ, the Five Thunders, the Eight Malevolents, and legions of celestial soldiers.\n\n**Internal Alchemy:** When the ritual master performs the rites, they must first purify with wine and burn incense to invoke the divine presence. Assuming the *shàngzhí* stance, they form the *shà* mudra with the left hand and the sword mudra with the right, standing in the *dīng* position. They first recite the *Tàiyīn Huàshēng Zhòu* or the *Běifāng Xuántiān Zhòu*. They visualize within their *níwán* palace a radiant golden character *nì*, shining with luminous clarity. Next, they press the Thunder Formation firmly upon their heart, imagining the heart’s fire descending in reverse to the space between the two kidneys, stirring the primordial *qi* to surge upward. They then visualize within the heart an Upper Perfected One. Following this, they transform the primordial *qi* into crimson fiery *qi*, which ascends to the *níwán* palace, merging with the golden character to burst forth and ascend directly to the northern heavens. There, they behold the Marshal descending upon this fiery light into the void. The ritual master then briefly directs their gaze toward the *gèn* direction behind their elbow, where the earth splits open, and a black tiger emerges from the black mist. The master immediately forms the *yín* mudra and shouts the syllable *duō!*—whereupon the tiger prostrates itself before the right side of the altar. Seeing the tiger submit, the Great Marshal descends from the void and, accompanied by the tiger, awaits commands.\n\n**Summoning Incantation:**\n*\"Black Tiger Great Spirit of Mount Wǔdāng,\nThunder roars to seize demonic spirits.\nLeading three hundred thousand celestial soldiers,\nThe Dark Mist of the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor surges forth,\nMighty and fierce, manifesting divine power.\nSix Dīng, Six Jiǎ, Eight Malevolent Generals—\nLiú Wénxiǎn, hasten swiftly to the altar!\nGreat Spirit, Great Spirit, come with speed!\nBy the decree of the Teaching King, the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor!\"*\n\nFor writing, anointing, consecrating, or dispatching talismans, use the preceding incantation. Visualize the three characters *wén duì shà*, then draw the *qi* of the Celestial Gate to proceed.\n\n**Personal Talisman:** Inscribe *\"Rescue Black Tiger Liú Wénxiǎn, Primordial Auspiciousness\"* and anoint with the *Tiānsuì Zhòu*.\n\n**Thunder Sound Incantation:** *Ōm.*\n\n**Talisman for Subjugation and Seizure:**\n*\"□ Dhāra □□□□ tī chì shà shè.\"*\nInscribe the right-side talisman with the preceding incantations in a single stroke. Layer the three characters *yuán hài jí duì xǐ shà* above the *xuán* character. Recite with the mouth, trace with the hand, and visualize three golden characters. Next, inscribe the petitioner’s name, imbuing the talisman with intent. Then visualize the character *niè* descending from the void into the *xuán* space, drawing it into the talisman. Recite the twelve-character Thunder Sound Incantation to envelop it. When spirits hear this, they tremble as though struck by thunder. Chant in a low, guttural voice, then seal the talisman with the *chì* character. Apply the Eight Trigrams with a tooth-mark, and the master silently intones *one*, envisioning the talisman radiant with golden light.\n\n**Secret Method of Transformation by Marshal Wēn of the Azure Mysterious Earth-Thunder:**\n**Commander-in-Chief:** Marshal Wēn of the Azure Mysterious Earth-Thunder, styled Qióng. His visage is that of a green-faced ghost, with golden eyes and four fangs. He wears a three-peaked hat, a red headband, a black robe with red brocade trim, a small golden sash, and yellow leggings. His chest is bared, a golden breastplate covering his heart, and he dons green boots. In hand, he wields a wolf-tooth staff, riding a white horse with all his generals in attendance.\n\n**Summoning and Transformation:**\nThe master visualizes the transformation, inscribing the *ōm* character on the *mǎo* trigram with the left hand and striking toward the east. The character transmutes into azure-golden light and is drawn in. The adept exhales from the liver palace, transforming into Marshal Wēn’s attire and colors. Proceed as usual, reciting the incantation while tracing the *gāng*.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*Ōm.*\n*\"By the Northern Emperor’s revered command, the universal spirit is seized.\"*\n\n**Arrangement of Trigrams for Seizure:**\n*Chǒu zǐ duì kūn wèi wǔ sì chén mǎo*\n*\"Seize the spirit, universal and revered, by the Northern Emperor’s command—Ōm.\"*\n*Mǎo chén sì wǔ wèi kūn duì zǐ chǒu*\n*Ōm.*\n*\"Xiē yǐ dì lán tuó yē.\"*\n*Chǒu yù lí wǔ chén sì mǎo*\n\nUpon completing the incantation, inscribe a *□* character on the *mǎo* trigram and strike toward the east. Visualize this character as a wheel, its golden light revolving upon the earth.\n\n**Secret Incantation:**\n*\"The Northern Emperor’s Purple Golden Wheel,\nTrue qi follows the Queen Mother.\nNine orifices open the Dao’s path,\nAscending to the Great Flowery Palace.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes!\"*\n\nAfter reciting, the master stamps the left foot to mimic thunder, swiftly splitting the secret character with the sword mudra. Marshal Wēn manifests in form. The adept draws him into the liver palace, passing through the *wěilǘ*, uniting the two kidneys. Golden light ascends the spine’s twin passes to the crown, where an infant appears. Drawn into the liver palace, it exhales over the incense burner, growing into the Marshal.\n\n**Personal Talisman:**\n*\"By decree, summon Wēn Qióng—hasten swiftly to descend!\"*\nRecite the *Northern Emperor’s Revered Command* while tracing the thunder array. Inscribe the secret character, infusing the Marshal’s presence, then layer the *chì* character to seal.\n\n**For Dispatching Orders:**\nFirst inscribe the talisman of the *Zhí Rì Gōngcáo* (Duty Day Attendant). Next, inscribe the personal talisman, then burn it with golden paper money and a horse effigy. Have the medium pass their hands over the incense, purify with sprinkled water, and summon the Marshal, visualizing him entering the medium’s hands. Burn a talisman, then inscribe the Marshal’s talisman upon the medium’s body. With the left hand on the *yín* trigram and the right wielding the sword mudra, write *ōm hōng niè zhà* to dispatch the talisman swiftly to seize. Seal with the *chì* character. With the sword mudra, inscribe *ōm hōng zhà là nà* to swiftly seize the flying soul. Write the *□* character and seal again with *chì*. With the left hand in the Dipper mudra and the right in the sword mudra, shout for the Marshal. Spread the five fingers, then shout for the generals and officials. Turn the hand to grasp the brush and state the matter as desired.\n\n**Talisman and Mudra for Pursuit and Seizure:**\n*\"Solemnly summon Marshal Wēn the Great Guardian of the Azure Mysterious Earth-Thunder, leading his host: the Soul-Pursuing and Ghost-Seizing Yellow-Headed and Disheveled Envoys, the Mountain-Sealing and Cave-Breaking Ghost-Slaying Blood-Dripping Envoys, the Earth Deities, the Seven Slayers, the Spirits of the Dying, the Mighty Yin Soldiers, and all under his command.

Black mist billows forth as the secret incantation is recited:\n*Ōm.*\n*\"□□—grim and dread,\nSwiftly manifest your true form!\"*\n\nOne qi, seven cycles.\n\nUpon completing the previous incantation, the master visualizes the black qi from within the earth’s gate surging outward, penetrating the Xun gate. Then, forming the *ti* mudra, he recites the secret incantation:\n\n*\"By the command of the Lord of the Sacred Peak,\nSwiftly summon the mighty spirits.\nMysterious Gen, pure Qian, level Dui, settled Kan,\nZhen’s decree, Kun’s obedience—Xun’s law is suddenly fulfilled.\nBefore I finish calling Wen Qiong,\nHasten, hasten!\nŌm hūm hūm, ōm □□.\"*\n\n*\"By the Northern Emperor’s decree,\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes!\"*\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, he parts the Xun direction, and the Great Marshal of the Primal Qi stirs violently. The master inhales sharply, drawing the qi inward, clearly visualizing it entering his heart. Next, he envisions the black qi from both kidneys ascending through the *shuangguan*, passing the gallbladder, and reaching beneath the throat. The Marshal, riding this black cloud, is exhaled before the altar, merging with it.\n\n**Talisman of the Self:**\n*Swiftly, by the decree of the Divine King of the Divine Empyrean, inscribe the three auspicious characters \"Yuán Jí Xǐ\" in the Zi script.*\n□□□□□□□ *Dǒu* (Dipper) in red, *Xìng* (Apricot) in ink, black-ground cinnabar, true *wà* (socks), *là* (wax), *Língbǎo* (Numinous Treasure).\n*By decree, summon the Grand Guardian.*\n*By decree, descend! By decree, summon Wen Qiong.*\n*Ōm hūm hūm □□, grim and dread—swiftly manifest your true form!*\nVisualize the general entering to report, then state your intent. Swiftly draw the qi of the Xun direction seven times, inscribing it upon the talisman with a single stroke toward Xun.\n\n**Decree Incantation:**\n*\"By the command of the Lord of the Sacred Peak,\nLeftward spin, rightward turn.\nFollow the steps of Kuí and Gāng—\nQian and Kun instantly appear.\nGrand Guardian, connect with the numinous,\nResplendent in ten thousand transformations.\nGuǐ Xùn Dīng Rén,\nGather essence like an arrow.\nBy this decree, act without delay!\nŌm, spirits, spirits—grim and dread,\nBreath to breath, □□—swiftly seize!\nŌm hūm hūm, ōm □□.\nBy the Northern Emperor’s decree,\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes!\"*\n\nUpon completing the incantation, apply the talisman and incantation of the Heavenly Divine Marchers. Invoke the Tianpeng incantation for secondary command.\n\n**Talisman of Instant Attachment:**\n□□□□□□□ *Tiāndīng* (Heavenly Divine Marchers), *Tiāndīng*—swiftly descend, connect with the numinous! *Wēnshǐ* (Wen Envoy), *Tàibǎo* (Grand Guardian), wield the punishing divine soldiers.

Leftward step Kuí, rightward press Gāng—Kun instantly appears!\n*\"Heaven opens, mortals are lost—you enter! Ōm hūm.\nEarth splits—seize! Ōm hūm nán—seize!\"*\nVisualize a lady in white robes and a golden crown, weeping as she enters the talisman, making a sound.\n\n**Stellar Sequence:**\n*Jiǎo, Kàng, Dī, Xīn, Wěi, Jī, Dǒu, Niú, Nǚ, Xū, Wēi, Shì, Bì, Kuí, Lóu, Wèi, Mǎo, Bì, Zī, Shēn, Jǐng, Guǐ, Liǔ, Xīng, Zhāng, Yì, Zhěn, Shí, Chén, Lù, Wén, Jiān, Wǔ, Pò, Yáng, Dǒu.*\n\nFor this talisman, draw the eastern qi (Mǎo script). It may be used for summoning, dispatching, fumigating the hands, or hastening commands.\n\n**Incantation of the Decree Mudra Formation:**\n*\"Tiānróng Dīng Yǒu, Tiānshēn Dīng,\nWèi urgently, Wǔ descends, Sì connects, Chén numinous.\nWēn Envoy, Grand Guardian,\nWield the punishing divine soldiers.\nEastern Mǎo, numinous Chén, by Sì’s decree,\nWǔ fire, Wèi urgently, Shēn obeys, Yǒu marches.\nXū Wū, Nǚ Zhú, Zǐ Hōng, Chǒu Mō,\nYín Wéi, Dǒu Mǎo, Tuó Chén, by Sì’s decree—seize!\nI uphold the Lord’s command,\nInstantly attach to the living.\nDàn Wǔ □ Sì, Wēn Chén illuminates,\nMǎo’s Great Primordial, Chǒu’s Mysterious, Zǐ’s level.\nCommanding soldiers to assist the Dharma,\nThe Three and Five Primal Lords.\nHài Wéi, Zǐ responds, Chǒu arrives, Yín’s path,\nMǎo Ōm, Chén Zhī, Sì Dā, Wǔ Tí.\nWèi Xū, Shēn □, Yǒu Mó, Xū Sà,\nHài Mó, Zǐ Yē, Chǒu Suō, Yín Hē.\nWēn Qióng, Grand Guardian,\nHear the summons—instantly attach to the living!\nSwiftly!\nI act by the decree of the Most Honorable Heavenly Equal, Benevolent and Sacred Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak!\"*\n\nExtract and employ the method—\nThe master abides in the eastern blue realm, lush and dense.\nThe adept draws forth the red qi from within the heart,\nDescends to merge with the liver’s qi,\nThen from the eyes emits purple qi,\nIntertwining with the eastern blue qi, cleaving and descending.\nFrom within the blue qi surges forth—\nSwiftly inhale, then exhale with a *xū* over the incense.\n\n**Attaching to the Medium**\nFirst, inscribe three talismans.\nUse one to summon and dispatch the marshaling generals,\nExpressing the matter at will.\nPrepare a basin of pure wood, recite the incantation while tracing the pattern,\nVisualize the operation entering the water.\nHave the child stand before the incense burner,\nSprinkle and purify.\nTake one talisman, roll it into a ball,\nAnd bury it within the incense burner.\nNext, have the child close their eyes,\nFumigate their right hand over the incense.\nThe master swiftly recites the incantation while tracing the pattern,\nSprinkles the pure water onto the child’s hand,\nThen presses another talisman into the burner.\nAfter three to five repetitions,\nThe spirit naturally ascends—\nOnce the child’s fingers begin to stir,\nCommand the attending officer to turn their hand,\nGrasp the brush, and report in writing.\nThe child must be literate.\nIf the possession is shallow, the spirit attaches to one arm only;\nIf deep, it fully ascends and writes.\nOnce the report is complete,\nThe child revives of their own accord,\nNo need to recite the awakening incantation.\nIf the spirit still does not attach,\nVisualize a lady-in-waiting holding these golden characters,\nWeeping over the incense smoke—\nIt will immediately come forth.\n\n**Another School**\nCommanding Marshal.\n\nThe Earth Deity of Mount Tai, the Illustrious Numinous and Radiant Martial Envoy, the Right-Assisting Marquis, Marshal Wen—named Qiong.\nHe wears a purple headscarf, has a green face, dons an official’s green wild-goose robe, black boots, and wields an iron whip.\n\n**Internal Alchemy**\nThe master closes their eyes and visualizes a mountain on their right shoulder, enveloped in blue qi—this is the Court of Mount Tai. Next, with the left hand, they trace the Dipper of Chén and Xū, □□□□□□□, suspended in the void. They see the two stars Kuí and Chī transform into the celestial characters for \"imperial decree,\" descending. The adept draws forth liver qi, exhales it over the incense, and it becomes a blue-robed youth holding a jade tablet. The youth receives the two golden characters onto the tablet, passes through Mount Tai, and with the golden light from the tablet, opens the gates of the mountain. Marshal Wen follows the blue-robed youth, riding the golden light as they arrive. The adept inhales through the nose, drawing them both into the liver palace. After a long while, the adept exhales over the incense smoke, and Marshal Wen manifests in full form. The adept then focuses their intent, draws the divine radiance from Marshal Wen’s body, and begins to inscribe the talisman.\n\nThe master next employs the Dipper mudra and the Sword mudra, recites the Northern Dark Heaven incantation and the Great Yin Transformation incantation, and visualizes the transformation into a perfected transcendent. Then they recite the summoning incantation:\n\n*\"By the Fire Mandate of Qian, united with luminous majesty,\nThe Emperor’s command descends—\nThe mountain marshal bears the charge.\nI humbly summon Wen Qiong,\nHasten forth from the court of Mount Tai!\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\"*\n\n*\"Dīng, Rén, Guǐ, Xùn—gather essence like an arrow,\nStraddling Kuí and Gāng, Qian and Kun instantly appear!\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\"*\n\n*\"The Wheel of the Northern Emperor, universally numinous, seizes and binds!\nOṃ. Sudṛdha, by command, slays and captures!\nHīṃ! Trailokyavijaya captures!\"*\n\nEach incantation is recited seven times in a single breath. The master traces the Mǎo trigram, draws forth eastern qi, and upon completion, silently visualizes the transformation into a perfected transcendent, secretly directing the proceedings.\n\n**Talisman for Swift Report**\n*\"Left: The Azure Numinous Spirit hastens to communicate!\nRight: The Metal Spirit of Kàng swiftly arrives!\nOṃ!

Reciting the previous incantations, they strike the talisman with the golden characters from the mudra, envisioning thunder, fire, lightning, and a great clap of thunder—Marshal Wen proceeds with the task.\n\nNext, the master recites the empowering incantation:\n\n*\"By the command of Jade Purity,\nAll spirits are restrained and governed.\nShould any defy,\nThe statutes of Nǚ Qīng shall apply!\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\"*\n\n**The Flying Swift Fire-Thunder Envoys—Great Rite**\n**Commanding Marshal**\n\n**Thunderbolt-Bearing Decree, Flying Swift Fire-Thunder Envoy Zhang, styled Yuanbo.**\nHis form blazes like sudden fire, his left hand forms the Thunder mudra, his right hand grasps a black banner, and his body rides a fire dragon.\n\n**Eight Trigrams Vajra Incantation:**\n*\"Om hum hum.\"*\n*\"Three Dāna, Qian-Yi Decree.\"*\n- *Hai-Dui Palace commands the thunder troops.*\n- *You-Gen Palace seals the demon gate.*\n- *Yin-Gao Palace drives the fire wheel.*\n- *Wu-North Sea surges with waves.*\n- *Zi-Human Gate shakes the earth’s axis.*\n- *Shen-Zhen Thunder swiftly resounds.*\n- *Mao-Raging winds topple mountains.*\n- *Si-All generals descend into my body.*\n\n*\"Slay the Great Numinous Perfected!

Returning it to the left and right terraces, it merges with the True One’s darkness. Revolving the Cinnabar Field’s qi upward to the Crimson Palace, it suffuses the body until warmth is felt. If not, circulate again until full, then guide it to the Twelve-Storied Tower, with the mouth’s qi as verification.\n\nVisualize the qi of the southeast—azure, red, and golden—descending. Exhale sharply to merge it into a single mass of crimson-gold fire-light. Inhale through the nose to gather it within. After a moment, when the spirit settles, exhale it onto the incense as a golden orb. With the sword mudra, inscribe:\n*\"By the Emperor’s decree, summon Yuanbo to swiftly manifest his true form!\"*\nSuddenly, the golden light splits open, and within the crimson qi’s chaos, Envoy Zhang stands before the altar.\n\nThe master then forms the Thunder mudra with the left hand and holds the brush in the right. Silently visualizing the marshal descending from the void, they proceed to inscribe the talisman.\n\n**Personal Talisman:**\n*\"Open the Heavenly Gate, close the Earthly Door;*\n*Hold the Human Gate, block the demon paths;*\n*Pierce the demon’s heart, rupture the demon’s belly.*\n*Yang left: □□□□□□□*\n*Yin right: Greed, Giant, Emolument, Literature, Integrity, Martiality, Ruin.*\n*Zi-Xin, Zi-Yin, Zi-Hui, Zi-Zhen, Zi-Lian, Zi-Wu, Zi-Geng.*\n*Front feet tread wind,*\n*Rear feet tread wind—*\n*Hasten beneath the altar to receive the decree, summoning Thunder Spirit Zhang Yuanbo.*\n*By command, execute the task.*\n*On yin days, begin from the right: Thunder’s might strikes, startling all.*\n*On yang days, begin from the left: Roaring, rumbling, swift and fierce, rescue and revere the decree.*\n*Now, Marshal Zhang Yuanbo, act as you will in this matter.*\n*Petition submitted on [year, month, day, hour] by [rank, name].\"*\n\n**Talisman Usage:**\n- For praying for clear skies: inscribe in vermilion on blue paper.\n- For praying for rain: inscribe in black on blue paper.\n- For summoning generals and officials: inscribe in vermilion on yellow paper.\n- For suppression and posting: inscribe in black on yellow paper.\n- For praying for clear skies or subduing malevolence: use the *All-Heaven Great Thunder-Fire Seal*; for all other matters, use the *Thunderbolt Capital Bureau Seal*.\n- For praying for rain, proceed in reverse; for clear skies, proceed forward.

In former times, during the first year of Yongshou in the Han dynasty, the Celestial Master convened at Lutang with the Year-General and the Lady of Great Yin, swearing an oath upon split stone that they would not imprison the people of the world, disrupt their dwellings, or bring forth calamities.\n\nNow, as reported, the petitioner’s household, on such-and-such a day, undertook construction without discerning the positions of yin and yang, nor the directions governed by spirits and malevolent forces. Fearing transgression against the Year’s Slayer, the Monthly Punishment, the Hour’s Inauspiciousness, or the Day’s Ominous Portents—thereby secretly offending the Earth Treasury and provoking the Spirit Bureau—disasters and afflictions have arisen in rapid succession, with illnesses compounding and the heart gripped by terror, leaving no peace day or night. The petitioner humbly beseeches relief and resolution.\n\nThis Bureau, acting on Heaven’s behalf to transform and succor all beings, cannot refuse such a plea.

They are further ordered to promptly withdraw their influence.

Facing the Gate of Heaven, I memorialize the Supreme Unity, await the decree, and recite the Supreme Unity’s invocation eighty-one times. Stepping four times through the Seven Stars... toward the Earthly Portal, I command the Jade Maiden of Nocturnal Radiance and the Five Thearchs’ Great Demons to bear banners and shatter the prison, visualizing the departed soul’s release from confinement.\n\n**Incantation to Summon the Jade Maiden of Nocturnal Radiance:**\nOṃ. Śikālīṃ dikā diye.\n\nVisualize the azure *qi* within the gallbladder transforming into a green-robed jade maiden, pearl in hand, emerging from the left eye to illuminate and breach the dark prison.\n\n**Incantation to Summon the Five Thearchs’ Great Demons:**\nOṃ. Jvalu panka daye.\n\nVisualize the white *qi* within the lungs transforming into a golden-armored general, grasping a five-colored treasure banner, pointing directly at the prison gate to guide the departed soul out.\n\nHaving performed the above method, recite the Golden Light Incantation and weave it into a golden bridge to receive the deceased. Absorb the banner’s essence or attach it to the youth’s body, proceeding as desired.\n\n**Another Tradition:**\nIn all ritual practice, the master first paces the Nine Palaces to erect a Dipper of Vast Release. Next, he traces the mudra to shield his body and silently recites the Transformation Incantation:\n\nWith reverence, I invoke the Nata Spirit of Fengdu—\nswiftly conceal my form, assume your shape.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes decree.\n\n**Dipper Mudra.**\n\n**Extermination Talisman of the Celestial Stems and Earthly Branches:**\n*Yin* aligns with *Zheng*, *Chou* with *Ji*, *Zi* with *Guang*, *Dui* clashes with *Kun*, *Wei* with *Qin*, *Wen* with the stellar pattern.\nWith this mudra and talismanic script, circumambulate the body thrice to the left and thrice to the right.\n\n**Summoning Incantation:**\nNow, as incense is offered, I invoke and summon:\nCommander-in-Chief Han, Marshal of the Inner Terrace Ai, the Great General of Beheading and Blood-Offering, the Two Spirit Officials Zeng and Ma, the Two Perfected Lords Jiao and Zeng, Marshal Guan of the Red-Haired Bright Pass, the Eight Extermination Generals—Wei, Liu, Wang, Meng, Che, Xia, Lie, and Sang—along with the Seventy-Two Examiners, the Demon Kings of the Three Caverns and Six Palaces, and all wardens, jailers, and spirit soldiers of the prisons. Let each grasp their implements of incarceration, array themselves to left and right, and heed my command.\n\n**Second Summons:**\nI call upon the luminous lords of the Five Emperors—\ntheir blades sharp as mirrors, their armor forged of bronze.\nAt my summons, descend with haste.\nBy the authority of the Great Emperor of Fengdu, I so decree.\n\nWith this mudra, draw the *qi* of the North.\n\n**Third Summons:**\nWith reverence, I invoke the Merit Officer for Expelling Evils, the marshals and functionaries of Fengdu, the Eight Extermination Generals of Cangues and Shackles, wielding iron staves, golden locks, and hammers, the Great Pillars of the Underworld, venomous serpents of gold, the Great Roc’s Deceptive Marshal, and all those who behead and offer blood—seventy-two administrative bureaus, internal and external jailers, and spirit soldiers. Follow me wherever I go to seize and bind spirits. By my ritual command, proceed first to hang and bind them, interrogate their circumstances, and subject them to lawful torture and examination. Bind them swiftly and bring them forth.\n\nHasten to obey!\n\n**Fengdu Interrogation and Summons Ritual Statutes.**\n\nThe summons complete, form the *sha* mudra and draw the *qi* of the North.\n\n**Method of Merit:**\n*\"The Azure Moon illumines the frigid pool.\"*\n\n*Oṃ kṣi jī fù* [□□□] *she.* (Recite the incantation seven times.)\n\nDraw one breath of Northern *qi*, swallow it into the heart, and transform it into a bright moon. Let it descend to illuminate the kidney-water, a limpid pool where water and moon intermingle. Within the moon appears a palace, inside which is a [□] character. Raise it forth, and from the two eyes it emerges, splitting into two generals who stand to left and right. The adept commands the Nine Ugly Ones to serve them.\n\n*\"Black winds blow through the Xun gate.\"*\n\n*Oṃ zhā zhuó jī* [□] *tuō* [□] *lī* [□] *sha she.* (Recite the incantation seven times.)\n\nDraw Northern *qi* and take several hundred paper coins. Visualize within the golden-black radiance a [□] character emerging from the northeast. Inhale it through the eyes, transforming it into golden light that issues forth to inscribe a talisman on paper. Have a youth hold it before and behind, tracing the characters in the air to bind the target.\n\n*\"Golden essence flies behind the elbow.\"*\n\n*Oṃ jī lú* [□] *luó yín* [□] *chì sha she.* (Recite the incantation seven times.)\n\nVisualize the ground behind the left elbow. Fix the gaze upon it and, with a sword, cleave it open. Behold black winds surging forth bearing the character *shān*. Inhale them into a water vessel, where they transform into a black mist that envelops the youth.\n\n*\"Inverted gold hangs above the well.\"*\n\n*Oṃ* [□] *líng tuō ní tí chì sha she.* (Recite the incantation seven times.)\n\nDraw one breath of Northern *qi* and swallow it into the cinnabar field of the kidney-water. Within it lies the character *shā*. Raise it to the two eyes, where it transforms into all the generals, who emerge before the altar to be dispatched for interrogation and torture.\n\n*\"Wind and thunder strike the earthen gate.\"*\n\n*Oṃ yín shén tā shén sha shén dì she.* (Recite the incantation seven times.)\n\nDraw one breath of Southern *qi* and swallow it into the heart, where it transforms into a sun’s radiance. Raise it to meet the kidney-water, and the body grows cold as ice. From the spine’s twin passes it ascends, employing the thunder wheel. Roll it past the kidneys and through both ears, producing the sound of wind and thunder. A [□] character emerges, cast forth with the thunder wheel to smash open the earthen gate. Summon the marshals and functionaries of Prefect Ai’s department to capture, pursue, and seize, exterminating great malevolences.\n\n**Next, recite the Binding and Attachment Incantation Formula:**\n*\"Bing binds, Zi gathers, Chou shackles, Yin tortures, Mao fetters, Chen imprisons, Si burns, Wu tiles, Wei hangs, Shen beheads, You severs tongues, Xu breaks, Hai captures.\"*\n\n**Incantation Formula for Attaching the Deceased Spirit:**\n*\"Míng míng xuán xuán hóng chéng* [□] *she.\"* (Recite seven times.)\n\n**Next, recite:**\n*\"Black smoke and baleful poison convey golden essence.\"*\n\nUpon completing the incantation formula, visualize the chariots of *Che* and *Xia* emerging to stand to left and right.\n\nNext, visualize within the heart a moon as vast as a house, within which a luminous jade maiden appears distinctly. Envision a jade maiden holding a black banner inscribed with golden characters, arriving from the north before the adept. Once the intent is fixed, the jade maiden from the moon joins the northern jade maiden, merging into one. Together with the two generals, they proceed to the Xun gate. With the banner, they force open the prison door, and all spirits bow in reverence.\n\nThe jade maidens and two generals enter. In an instant, visualize the jade maiden now holding a yellow banner inscribed with black characters, leading the deceased forth. All generals and attendants escort them before the adept. Inhale the spirit’s *qi* and blow it onto the banner, attaching it to the person holding it. Then draw one breath of ghostly *qi* and again visualize the deceased spirit, blowing it onto the youth’s body.\n\n**Talisman for Gathering at the Altar:**\n*Xī* [锡] *jiàn è*\n*Five Sovereign Spirit Lords*\n*Zēng xīn kǎi tóng*\n*Torture and bind ghostly spirits, pursue and seize the deceased.*\n*For capturing the deceased, employ this.*\n*\"Wind spirits hasten to arrive, earth spirits hasten to depart.\nHeaven’s noose binds, earth captures, fire—\nThe Three Officials and Five Sovereigns issue their statutes.\"*\n\nUpon completing the talisman, recite the *Golden Light Incantation* three times. Infuse it with *qi* and burn it before the altar.\n\n**Incantation Formula for Empowering the Talisman:**\n*Oṃ kǎn zhā kūn zhuó zhèn jī xùn jiàn zhōng tuō zhá* [□] *duì lī gèn chì sha she lí chū.*\n\n**Great General Talisman:**\n*Xī chú jiàn è*\n*Five Sovereign Spirit Lords*\n*Together with the Four Generals, interrogate and bind ghostly spirits.*\n*\"Wind spirits hasten to arrive, earth spirits hasten to depart.\nZhuó jī pán tuó lán, spirits—seize!\nSwiftly pursue, swiftly seize, swiftly bind—\nregardless of great or small, whether malevolence or kin,\nhasten to drive them forth!\nUrgent as Fengdu’s Interrogation and Summons Ritual Statutes!\"*\n\nForm the *sha* mudra, draw Northern *qi*, and visualize the Eight Generals entering.\n\n**Incantation for Empowering the Talisman:**\n*\"Spirits of Fengdu, spirits of Fengdu, hasten to descend!\nGolden hammers wildly dance, iron staves cross and clash,\nwith shackles and breaking, with binding and seizing—\nregardless of kinship, swiftly bind and present them!\nFengdu’s demon kings, gather at the altar and manifest!\nFollow my ritual command—swiftly bind and present them!\nUrgent as Fengdu’s Interrogation and Summons Ritual Statutes!\"*\n\n**Method for Activating the Command Tablet and Seal:**\nThe master first visualizes behind the left elbow, directing the gaze with both eyes. From the nose issue white and black *qi*; turning the head, observe the right elbow, where a stream of black *qi* rises to meet it. Perceive the rushing wind, inhale it, and hold it within.\n\nBlow onto the seal and command tablet forty-nine times.\n\nIf employing a youth as medium, combine this *qi* with one breath of Northern *qi* and inhale it to spray onto the youth.\n\n*Precious Pearl from the Sea of Ritual, Scroll Thirty-Nine, Concluded*\n*#1 \"Secret Methods of Fengdu’s Western Terrace, the Bright Spirit Exterminator Marshal of the Pass of Primordial Qi\": Transmitted by the Northern Emperor’s Lineage.*\n\n*The Orthodox Anthology of Daoist Methods, Scroll 259, \"Secret Methods of the Earth Spirits’ Exterminator Marshal of the Pass of Primordial Qi\"* states: This is the great method by which Zhang Xujing, the thirty-sixth Celestial Master of the Northern Song’s Chongning era, commanded the divine spirit of Guan Yu to slay dragons and subdue demons—henceforth known as the *Ancestral Method of Slaying Dragons and Exterminating Demons*. Thus, Zhang Xujing is revered as the ancestral master. *The same work, Scroll 26*, records *The Secret Methods of Fengdu’s Bright Spirit Marshal of the Pass of Primordial Qi*, which belongs to the same lineage and may serve as corroborating evidence.\n\n*#2 \"Secret Methods of the Supreme Clarity Fengdu General Records Bureau\": Transmitted by the Northern Emperor’s Lineage.*\n\n*The Orthodox Anthology of Daoist Methods, Scrolls 262 and 263*, which collect *The Great Fengdu Interrogation and Summons Methods*, likewise belong to this tradition and may serve as corroborating evidence.\n\n*Precious Pearl from the Sea of Ritual, Scroll Forty-Six, \"Swift-Flight Secret Methods #1\"*\n\n**Chief Marshal:**\nThe Swift-Flight Responsive Messenger Zhang, named Yuanbo. His face bears a ruddy hue; he wears a crossed-scarf headwrap, a yellow headband, golden armor, a close-sleeved short robe, a wind-blown cloak with fluttering sashes tied at the knees, and green boots. He wields an iron axe and rides atop lightning and flame.\n\n**Names of the Six Ding Spirits:**\n- Dingmao Swift-Flight Shang Messenger, named De.\n- Dingchou Swift-Flight Ma Messenger, named Guang.\n- Dinghai Swift-Flight He Messenger, named Yantong.\n- Dingyou Swift-Flight Bian Messenger, named Cheng.\n- Dingwei Swift-Flight Li Messenger, named Cong’e.\n- Dingsi Swift-Flight Zhang Messenger, named Congzheng.\n\nThe above six spirits all take demonic forms: snouted like swine, sharp-mouthed, with fleshy wings, purple hair, golden eyes, naked bodies, ruddy limbs, golden bracelets on their wrists, golden bands on their foreheads, fleshy floral horns, white skullcaps, crimson wind-cloaks, and green flying sashes. In their left hands they hold official documents; in their right, black banners inscribed with golden characters summoning the Thunder Gods. The banner-tails stream toward the Xun direction as they descend from the Xun quarter, riding golden lightning and flame in flight.\n\n**Summons Incantation:**\nFive Thunder Spirit-Generals, manifesting a thousand truths,\nCommanding thunder and lightning, coursing fire and moving clouds.\nFrom the five directions, *qi* descends—swiftly drive the thunder!\nI bid you come before this altar court.\nObey my command and act—hasten, hasten!\nBy the decree of the Jade Clarity True King, swiftly, swiftly as the thunderfire statutes!\n\nUpon reciting the above incantation, to summon the Six-One Spirit: First exhale a breath of primordial *qi*, visualizing heaven and earth merging into a single crimson chaos. Next, inhale a golden breath of lung *qi* to burst it open. Direct your gaze toward the west, where the Great One resides in the southwest Kun position. Employ the transformation to form a golden bridge, which surges from the nose to connect with the Xun gate. Suddenly, the Great One appears above, blending indistinctly with the messenger, descending together via the golden bridge. They stand amidst lightning and flame, awaiting commands.\n\nWhen inscribing talismans, draw in *qi* to infuse the symbol.\nWhen subduing malevolent spirits, wield the axe.\nWhen summoning thunder, grasp the banner.\nBoth banner and axe are transformations of the Great One’s sword; the messenger assumes form through the presentation of *qi*, merging with the Great One.\n\n**Secret Summons Incantations for the Six Ding Messengers:**\n\n*Om om han han!*\nSwiftly summon Dingmao Swift-Flight Messenger Shang De!\n*Nadatnu!*\nCelestial might and power, iron-armored flying lightning.\nSix Ding follow fire—hastily drive the fierce forms!\nSwiftly, swiftly as the statutes!\n\n*Om om han han!*\nSwiftly summon Dingchou Swift-Flight Messenger Ma Guang!\n*Duotanu!*\nStatutes fly with fire;

Around the first watch (*zi* hour), lay a clean mat upon the ground, arrange the spirit tablet, and complete the offerings. The master dons black robes, wields a sword, lets down his hair, and stands barefoot. He then visualizes his primordial spirit and silently reports to the Supreme Unity Emperor Lord. Afterward, he transforms his spirit and silently recites the *Celestial Peng* incantation seven times, envisioning himself as the Celestial Peng.\n\nNext, he steps the Nine Stars’ *Gang* and stands at the center to proceed. First, he summons Attendant Zhang and entrusts him with the task of summoning the Six-One spirits.

Avoid the presence of the old, young, monks, nuns, women, livestock, or those with malignant illnesses.\n\n**Offering Formulary**\n**Dingmao Swift Attendant Shang**\nOffer with wine, rice, food, fruit, paper, candles, flags, incense, dried venison, and straw sandals.\n\n**Dingchou Swift Attendant Ma**\nOffer with wine, rice, fish, fruit, paper flags, candles, dried venison, and straw sandals.\n\n**Dinghai Swift Attendant He**\nOffer with wine, rice, food, fruit, paper candles, floral flags, dried venison, and straw sandals.\n\n**Nine Heavens Supreme Unity Moon Comet Thunder Sovereign**\nOffer with wine, fruit, tea, a seal, sword, mirror, incense, candles, and the talismanic banner for summoning thunder spirits.\n\n**Dingyou Swift Attendant Bian**\nOffer with wine, rice, food, fruit, paper, a sheep’s head, flags, candles, dried venison, and straw sandals.\n\n**Dingwei Swift Attendant Li**\nOffer with wine, rice, food, fruit, paper, chicken, flags, flowers, dried venison, and straw sandals.\n\n**Dingsi Swift Attendant Zhang**\nOffer with wine, rice, food, fruit, paper candles, flags, incense, dried venison, and straw sandals.\n\nArrange the above on a clean mat, facing the Celestial Gate and with one’s back to the Earthly Door. The master stands with his back to the Celestial Gate, facing the *Xun* direction to proceed. Use yellow paper for the seven spirit tablets, inscribing them in black ink. The summoning flags and six spirit flags are to be inscribed in cinnabar on black silk, with the title: *“Swift Attendant of the [Current] Decan, Celestial Joy Venerable Spirit.”* Only Attendant Zhang’s tablet is not set; visualize him departing toward the *Xun* direction.\n\n**Talisman for Summoning the Four Seasonal Merit Officers**\n**Year-Standing Talisman**\n\n**Monthly Merit Officer Talisman**\n**Daily Merit Officer Talisman**\n**Hourly Merit Officer Talisman**\n\n**Summoning Incantation**\nSummon the Year-Standing, Month-Standing, Day-Standing, and Hour-Standing Four Great Merit Officers. *□□□□□mā shè chà.* Above heaven, below heaven, the Eight Trigrams and yin-yang, the Merit Officers and talismanic envoys—divine majesty unfurls.

With my uprightness, I correct what is not upright; with my unity, I unify what is not unified. Only in uprightness and unity does thunder become the thunder within this body—what fear is there that it will not come when summoned or fail to serve when commanded?\nAll who share this aspiration, heed these words well.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by the Elder of Mount Qingcheng’s Cavern Mountain, Li Tieming of Western Shu.\n\nThe Primordial Lineage\n\nThe Imperial Master, the Primordial Dao

Its *\"Lineage and Origins of the Dharma School\"* traces the transmission from the Iron Treasure Supreme Emperor and Iron Master Supreme Emperor, following the Iron Ascendant Supreme Emperor, to the Patriarchal Dharma-Holder, Propagator of the Teachings, and Founder of the Xuanjiao School, Iron Tablet Jade Creek Southern Perfected, named Wen Biao. The succession continued with Iron Inscription Dongshan Perfected Li Yingxin, Thunder Marshal Supreme Minister of the Unified Qi Perfected Iron Alms-Bowl Thunder Master Yulong Tiemuer, and Thunder Marshal Supreme Minister Iron Mountain Thunder Master Li Mingzheng. It also includes the *\"Precepts of the Supreme Primordial Chaos Teachings\"*, which elaborates on the principles, laws, and ordinances of the Primordial Chaos School, serving as a valuable reference.\n\n---\n\n**Ritual Procedures for Petition and Memorial**\n\nThe method states: First, observe the precepts, bathe, and change into ritual attire. Prepare the memorial by using the middle joint of your middle finger as a one-inch measure, making the document nine inches in height and width. Avoid empty words; ensure utmost sincerity in truthfully recording the matter at heart, with simplicity and solemnity as paramount.\n\nOn a quiet night, compose yourself in stillness and contemplation. Do not allow those who consume meat, outsiders, women, individuals in mourning attire, or cats and dogs to witness the ritual. This is called a *\"secret memorial from the heart\"*, and an auspicious day may be chosen. In urgent cases, no day need be selected—simply focus the mind, offer one stick of incense and a cup of water, and face the pivot of the Dipper with utmost sincerity, performing the rite as prescribed.\n\n---\n\n**Incantation for Changing Attire**\n*Qian yuan heng li zhen.*\nThe Fusang tree emits its essence,\nFive-colored clouds envelop the body.\nClothing covers the form,\nIn all movements and travels,\nMay the hun and po souls be at peace,\nAll evil subdued,\nEternally enjoying the blessed court.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nAfter reciting this incantation, the master silently intones the *\"Purification of the Mouth\"* incantation, makes the *zi* mudra, draws northern *qi*, and swallows it. Then, the *\"Purification of the Body\"* incantation is recited while making the *zi* mudra with both hands, drawing northern *qi* and blowing it to sweep both shoulders.\n\nNext, intone the *\"Purification of Heaven and Earth Qi\"* and the *\"Slaying Mudra\"*, drawing northern *qi*.\n\n---\n\n**Incantation for Dispelling Impurities**\nThe Nine Phoenix Perfected,\nPhoenixes that break impurities,\nClad in vermilion, wielding swords,\nStand above me.\nNine heads spew fire,\nAdvancing before me.\nFlaming, engulfing the earth,\nTen zhang of firelight.\nThe Nine Phoenixes break impurities,\nEvil spirits perish.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances of the Supreme Emperor!*\n\nMake the *wu* mudra and draw southern *qi*.\n\n---\n\n**Nine Phoenixs’ Vajra**\nWith the right foot stepping and the hand sweeping, the master visualizes the Nine Phoenix Perfected, clad in vermilion ritual robes, wielding fire swords, riding nine-headed vermilion phoenixes, descending from the south to cover the practitioner’s form. Each of the Nine Phoenixes spews fierce fire, burning away impure *qi* until all is purified.\n\nNext, silently recite the secret incantation:\n*He ming tian di ri.*\n\nRecite this incantation in one breath, nine times, make the *wu* mudra, draw southern *qi*, and focus the mind so that the ritual space is illuminated as if under the sun. Then, step through the hexagrams.\n\n*Winter Solstice*\n*Summer Solstice*\n\n**Subtle Sound Incantation**\nSeven Ghosts, Seven Stars—essences of all numinous spirits.\nThe Two Attendants, the Two Assistants—luminous emblems of the Three Terraces.\nThe Six Ding Jade Maidens, the Four Generals of the Purple Tenuity.\nThe Celestial Vanguard, the Celestial Origin—Kan Water and the Human Origin.\nThe Four-Eyed Divine Immortals, the Golden Youths who transmit words.\nRecite this one hundred times, and the Seven Perfected will manifest.\nProlong life, dispel misfortune, restrain poison, extinguish demons.\nPray as you will, and preserve true prosperity.\nThe body radiates light, and Qian’s primal power flows smoothly.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances of the Northern Dipper and the Supreme Mystery!\n\nUpon completing the incantation, the master makes the Dipper Seal, recites the preceding incantation once—or forty-nine times—while the left hand forms the mudras of Greed, Greatness, Emolument, Health, Military, and Destruction, and the right hand forms [the corresponding seals]. Next, visualize the Seven Stars descending and appearing distinctly.\n\n**Secret Incantation**\nIntestine Bright, Yin Essence, One Perfected, Mysterious Darkness.\nCinnabar Origin, Northern Gate—numinous power of the Celestial Pass.\nRemove this servant’s name from the register of death, inscribe this servant’s name in the record of long life.\nAll requests are fulfilled, all wishes are accomplished.\nAll people hold one in esteem, and one ascends to the Purple Court.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances of the Northern Dipper and the Supreme Mystery!\n\nThis method is used to enter the Dipper for audience and petition. The master visualizes the Four Upright Merit Officers leading the way, two Jade Maidens bearing banners crossing the bridge, and two messengers riding clouds to enter.\n\nThe master visualizes the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars distinctly, each patrolling three to five hundred *li*, the Dipper’s light shining below, blazing as if under the sun. Next, click the teeth, offer incense, clasp the Dipper Seal, and recite the secret incantation:\n\nIncense burns with sincerity, the will gazes upon celestial perfection.\nThe Dipper’s gates open, illuminating principle and clarity.\nThe Seven Origins, the Three Terraces, the Northern Culmen Sovereign.\nThe Three Luminaries, the Nine Radiant Ones, the divine soldiers of ten thousand *li*.\nCelestial generals receive the talisman’s command—my orders are swiftly executed.\nThe Dharma’s commands are wisdom, the Dao’s path connects to the real.\nThe Dharma harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, the Dharma protects my body.\nA thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally perfected.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances of the Northern Dipper and the Supreme Mystery!\n\nWith both hands forming the *wu* mudra, silently recite the *Purify Heaven and Earth Incantation*. When the flames blaze, burn the petition in the abundant incense fire, close the eyes, and visualize while reciting the secret incantation nine times:\n\nThe heart’s spirit and cinnabar origin enable my communion with the real.\nContemplate the spirit, refine the fluid—true darkness abides forever.\nI now submit my petition, may it swiftly reach the Stellar Palace.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!\n\n*Oṃ ma da li.*\n*Yaṃ cha li.*\n\n*Ha-□-li.*\n\nUpon reciting the above incantation thrice, hold the breath and concentrate the spirit, gazing downward into the heart. Circulate the heart’s crimson *qi*, then raise the eyes and exhale it upward. Visualize the crimson *qi* ascending to the crown of the head, where it meets the azure *qi*, transforming into a rainbow bridge spanning the mid-heavens and entering directly into the Dipper’s mouth.\n\nThen visualize within the *qi* a perfected person, clad in a scarlet immortal’s robe and crowned with the *Jin Xian* coronet, riding the crimson *qi* and bearing the burnt petition in both hands, ascending straight through the rainbow bridge into the Dipper’s mouth.\n\nProclaim: *\"Disciple [Name] now presents a matter of the heart for your attention.\"*\n\nNext, visualize two figures within the Dipper, resembling jade maidens in form, dressed in official green immortal robes adorned with white fish carriages. One holds a ram’s head in the left hand and a sword in the right—this is the *Striker of the Ram* Messenger. The other supports a golden tray in the left hand, upon which rests a peony, while holding a peony branch in the right—this is the *Dhāraṇī* Messenger.\n\nFrom the Dipper emerge clouds of five auspicious colors. Present the petition’s contents to them, and one of the messengers will convey it upward to the Dipper star governing the appropriate palace. Should any words be misstated or flawed, humbly beseech correction and proper presentation, lest the celestial officials impose reprimand. Earnestly hope for the petition’s acceptance to fulfill the heart’s intent, and swiftly grant a response.\n\nUpon speaking, visualize the heart’s spirit clearly entrusting the petition to one of the messengers. See the two messengers solemnly present it and enter the Dipper.\n\nThen recite the secret incantation:\n\nThe Mysterious Supreme Yin—eight windows open bright.\nAll petitions presented, the jade maidens convey the numinous.\nEvery seeking is fulfilled, every wish is accomplished.\nA thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally perfected.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!\n\nHeart-spirit, heart-spirit, unite with the Dao in truth.\nThe petition ascends, then returns to its origin.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!\n\n*Oṃ. □-jik-ra-ti-cha-□-ming-shep.*\n\nOne Qi, Three Traversals\n\nUpon completing the incantation, trace from the *zi* character to the *hai* character on the cyclical wheel, entering the middle joint of the middle finger, then gather and stabilize. Visualize green qi ascending from the Mud Pill Palace, then imagine red qi being drawn in through the nose. Next, rotate the head once in a full circle, inhale qi once more, and swallow it. Envision the spirit riding the qi as it enters through the nose, returning to its proper place, then stand ready to await the response.\n\n**Writing the Heart Petition and Conducting the Ritual**\n\nWhen writing a heart petition, first compose the spirit and settle the thoughts. Then perform the Nine Phoenix Rite, recite the invocation to the Radiant Heavenly Emperor, and follow with the secret incantation to consecrate the paper, brush, and ink. Do not utter a sound while writing the petition.\n\n**Incantation:**\n\nGreat Radiance of Heaven and Earth,\nMyriad qi intermingle and arise.\nI attain the True One,\nWithin the Jade Court of Inner Vision.\nThe August Emperor of Emptiness commands,\nBidding me to commune with the perfected.\nUpper Prime Red Child,\nThree Primes and Six Palaces—\nAll spirits assemble,\nMerging with my body.\nAscending to the Dipper’s palace,\nEntering and exiting the Purple Court.\nRoaming and feasting in the Eight Darknesses,\nThe Three Ones ascend to the Upper Radiance.\nGrand Unity, Mysterious Perfected,\nConvey my intent,\nTransmit it to the Dipper’s perfected.\nWhatever the heart desires,\nSilently present and receive assent.\nThe received Mysterious Decree\nAccords with my heart’s spirit.\nAll worldly affairs,\nEach and every one, are resolved.\nThe spirit soars to the Jade Altar,\nThe body divides into one form.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!\n\nUpon completing the incantation, draw in northern qi and blow it forth. Then visualize the Jade Stars standing in the five directions, with the sun and moon to the left and right.\n\n**Format for the Heart Petition**\n\n[Rank and Name], Your humble servant [Full Name], respectfully states:\n\nI have heard that the Nine Dawns reside above, truly governing the oversight of illumination. The Most High, in compassion, has bestowed the teachings of prayer and expiation. For any matter sought, petition and declaration are permitted.\n\nYour servant now submits this petition for [state intent], humbly presenting this document before the sacred presence of the Northern Dipper.\n\nI reverently beseech the Dao’s compassion to absolve all my transgressions of irreverence and offense, and to grant special mercy, permitting the fulfillment of my petition. I earnestly implore the bestowal of grace and command, that it may accord with my heart’s desire.\n\nFor my presumption in troubling your august majesty, your servant’s feelings are overwhelmed with urgency and longing. I prostrate myself in anticipation of the Dao’s decree.\n\n[Year] [Month] [Day]\n[Rank and Name], Your humble servant [Full Name], respectfully submits this petition.\n\nSeal the petition with the governance seal; do not use an outer envelope or wrapping.\n\nFirst, with the left hand, perform the Nine Phoenix Rite, blow while reciting the invocation to the Radiant Heavenly Emperor, and visualize the act of consecration.\n\nNext, with the left hand, press the *xu* and *hai* positions to form the Opening the Heavenly Gate mudra.\n\nThen press the *kun* and *xun* characters, anointing the left and right eyes to form the Preserving the Human Gate.\n\nNext, press the upper joints of the four fingers, visualizing the Golden Lad of Incense Offering and the Jade Maiden of Message Transmission.\n\nThen press the upper, middle, and lower joints of the middle finger to form the Three Heavens mudra, and flick upward to open the Three Heavenly Gates.\n\n**Incense for Petitioning the Dipper**\n\nCogon grass, fennel seeds, cloud incense, pine seeds, cypress seeds.\n\nThese incenses are local products, the tokens of the earth. Though aloeswood, sandalwood, benzoin, and frankincense may be exquisite, they are but the qi of foreign cliffs and crags—ill-suited for addressing the true. The finest is still *jiangzhen* incense.\n\n**Matters Governed by the Dipper’s True Ones**\n\nAll methods of petitioning the Dipper depend on the practitioner’s application. Generally, those who fail to receive a response do so because they do not know which governing star presides over their affair. Just as human kings and ministers have officials assigned to specific duties, so too must one not petition indiscriminately. The celestial real ones, after all, have their own bureaus and offices. To draft a memorial, first determine the nature of the matter, then identify which star governs it, and petition accordingly—assurance of a response will follow.\n\n**First Heaven:** The Celestial Commandant, the Star Lord of Greed-Wolf, and his consort, the Inner Consort, oversee the redress of wrongs, the vindication of right, the suppression of others’ evil, the advancement of one’s own virtue, the remission of sins, and the prayer for blessings. They hold office during the *Shi* and *Bi* mansions, and the *Kui* and *Lou* constellations.\n\n**Second Heaven:** The Grand Steward, the Star Lord of Great Gate, and his consort, the Inner Concubine, govern the arts of yin and yang, official advancement, and the pursuit of schemes. They hold office during the *Wei*, *Mao*, *Bi*, and *Zi* mansions.\n\n**Third Heaven:** The Minister of Works, the Star Lord of Prosperity-Keeper, and his consort, the Primordial Mother, oversee the study of the Dao, the quest for immortality, and communion with the true and attainment of the sagely. They hold office during the *Shen*, *Jing*, *Gui*, and *Liu* mansions.\n\n**Fourth Heaven:** The Patrol General, the Star Lord of Literary Brilliance, and his consort, the Inner Consort, govern the subjugation of human and spectral foes and the execution of malevolent forces. They hold office during the *Xing*, *Zhang*, *Yi*, and *Zhen* mansions.\n\n**Fifth Heaven:** The Dipper Lord, the Star Lord of Integrity-Chastity, and his consort, the Eldest Daughter, oversee the augmentation of lifespan, the establishment of merit, and the prayer for blessings. They hold office during the *Jiao*, *Kang*, *Di*, and *Fang* mansions.\n\n**Sixth Heaven:** The Grand Master of Ceremonies, the Star Lord of Martial Brilliance, and his consort, the Middle Daughter, govern the alleviation of calamities, obstructions, illnesses, and misfortunes, and the prayer for relief and exemption. They hold office during the *Xin*, *Wei*, *Ji*, and *Dou* mansions.\n\n**Seventh Heaven:** The Supreme Emperor, the Star Lord of Rupture-Soldier, and his consort, the Youngest Daughter, oversee the resolution of cosmic blockages and the regulation of qi and seasonal cycles. They hold office during the *Niu*, *Nü*, *Xu*, and *Wei* mansions.\n\n**Eighth Heaven:** The Venerable Jade Emperor’s Outer Assistant, the Star Lord, and his consort oversee the exorcism of manifold disasters and the prolongation of life through medicinal practice. They hold office on the day of one’s original destiny and natal hour.\n\n**Ninth Heaven:** The Perfected of the Grand Master of Ceremonies, the Inner Counselor, the Star Lord, and his consort oversee prayers for the people’s blessings and the salvation of all matters. They hold office on the day of one’s original destiny and natal hour.\n\n**The Heavenly Stem Method**\n\nEach month, regularly add *xu*; at every hour, behold the Star Lord of Rupture-Soldier. If the monthly general has not yet passed, then proceed in sequence through the original palace.\n\nFor example: at the *hai* hour in the first month, wishing to locate the Celestial Stem, the first month’s Celestial Stem at the *xu* hour resides in *yin*. The celestial Way revolves leftward, and the *hai* hour is precisely at the *xu* position.\n\nIt is also said: the general of the first month is at *hai*; the celestial Way revolves leftward, and the general of the second month is at *xu*.\n\nFor example: at the *zi* hour in the first month, wishing to know the location of the Celestial Stem’s palace, take the first month’s general at the *hai* hour and superimpose it upon *zi*, then proceed rightward to encounter *chen*—this is the palace of the Celestial Stem.\n\nAt the *zi* hour in the first month, *hai* is added to *zi* and counted off; *chen* falls upon *si*, so at that hour the Celestial Stem is precisely at *si*.\n\nIn the rightward method, visualize a firelight as fine as a thread descending obliquely; inhale through the nostrils to gather the center, then look upward—this is the *qi* of the Celestial Stem.\n\n**Auspicious Days for Petitioning the Northern Dipper’s Procession**\nFor petitions to the Dipper, observe the third and seventh auspicious days of each month, *gengshen* and *jiazi*, the Three Origins and Five La days, followed by the days governed by the lunar mansions, and further by the establishment days of each month.\n\n**First Month:** The twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth days; *yin*, *mao*, *chen*, *wei*, *shen*, *you*, *hai*, and *zi* days are auspicious.\n**Second Month:** The third, seventh, twenty-third, and twenty-sixth days; *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, *shen*, *you*, *xu*, *si*, *wu*, and *wei* days are auspicious.\n**Third Month:** The twenty-sixth day; *mao*, *chen*, *si*, *shen*, *you*, and *xu* days are auspicious.\n**Fourth Month:** The seventeenth and twenty-seventh days; *yin*, *mao*, *chen*, *you*, *xu*, *hai*, *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* days are auspicious.\n**Fifth Month:** The third, thirteenth, and twentieth days; *chen*, *si*, *wu*, *you*, *xu*, *hai*, *chou*, *yin*, and *mao* days are auspicious.\n**Sixth Month:** The fourth and eighth days; *mao*, *chen*, *si*, *xu*, *hai*, *zi*, *wei*, *shen*, and *you* days are auspicious.\n**Seventh Month:** The fourth and twenty-fourth days; *si*, *wu*, *wei*, *xu*, *hai*, *zi*, *yin*, *mao*, and *chen* days are auspicious.\n**Eighth Month:** The third, nineteenth, eleventh, and twenty-seventh days; *hai*, *zi*, *chou*, *chen*, *si*, *wu*, *shen*, *you*, and *xu* days are auspicious.\n**Ninth Month:** The third and eighteenth days; *wu*, *wei*, *shen*, *hai*, *zi*, *chou*, *mao*, *chen*, and *si* days are auspicious.\n**Tenth Month:** The tenth and twenty-sixth days; *zi*, *chou*, *yin*, *si*, *wu*, *wei*, *you*, *xu*, and *hai* days are auspicious.\n**Eleventh Month:** The first, ninth, seventeenth, and fifteenth days; *zi*, *chou*, *yin*, *chen*, *xu*, *wu*, *wei*, *shen*, and *you* days are auspicious.\n**Twelfth Month:** The twentieth day; *wei*, *shen*, *you*, *xu*, *hai*, *zi*, *chou*, *yin*, and *mao* days are auspicious.\n\n**The Dipper’s Numinous Chapter**\n*Om.*\n\n*Chali shenzha hōngli. □.

Leave three characters blank at the top, one character blank at the bottom, three lines blank at the front, and four lines blank at the back to form the grid. On the outer envelope, write:\n\n*Presented before the Dao of the Star Lord of the [X]th Position of the Northern Dipper, by your subordinate [Name], sealed within this memorial.*\n\n*Square Envelope*\n*Presented to the Northern Dipper’s Mysterious Mechanism Palace, by your subordinate [Name], respectfully sealed.*\n\n**Memorandum Format**\n*To the Thunder Bureau.*\n\n*Memorial to be transmitted to the Dipper’s Central Office: The red-inked talisman \"Om kayā tathā hōngli zha mō\" is entrusted to the Great Divine Messenger.*\n\nNow, in accordance with the stated intent and the received petition, we dare not suppress or obstruct. Respectfully prepared is one copy of the Dipper’s Numinous Chapter, to be conveyed to the True Dipper, requiring transmission. We hereby memorialize and urgently request that the wind-borne courier bear and present the Numinous Chapter, proceeding directly to the steps of the Mysterious Pivot, to convey the circumstances and submit the petition on our behalf, humbly beseeching the sagely Dipper Sovereign to incline its radiance downward and bestow its gracious power.\n\nWe implore that for [Name], the sins and transgressions within their person be pardoned, the baleful stellar influences be harmonized and warded off, peace and well-being be secured, illnesses be pacified, and prayers be answered through spiritual resonance. We await the manifest response and earnestly hope for swift tidings.\n\n*Respectfully memorialized.*\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month, at the ___ hour, this memorial is respectfully submitted.\n\n*Om. Om. Om. By imperial decree. Hum. Hum. Southern Spirit of Ma. Zha. Hum. Hum. Li.

Gaya. Tāra. Hum. Li. Zha. Ma.*\n\nLet the Great Divine Messenger swiftly arrive.\n*Gaya. Hum. Om. By decree. Fire [seal] Zha. Om. Da. Zha. Hum. Hum. Svāhā.*\n\nBy this method, visualize the messenger arriving before you from the Dipper’s Mouth, riding golden light, wearing a black cap with a celestial-facing topknot and black robes, bearing a document casket. Upon completing the invocation, hold the chapter with the Dipper Mudrā, visualizing the characters within transforming into golden radiance.\n\nNext, recite the memorial and burn the chapter in the incense burner with abundant fragrant flames. Then, invoke the messenger, state the purpose, and dispatch them by decree. With both hands, perform the Yin-Yang Dipper gesture to sever the connection, sprinkle water, and visualize the messenger ascending to the Dipper Palace upon golden light.\n\nThen recite the Northern Dipper Salvation-from-Suffering Divine Incantation:\n*Hum. Om. By decree. Zha. Svāhā. Hum. Da. By decree. Zha. Svāhā. Mo. Li. By decree. Zha. Svāhā. Hum. [Seal] Li. By decree. Zha. Svāhā. Hum. Na. Ma. Da. Li. By decree. Zha. Svāhā. Hum. By decree. Da. Li. By decree. Zha. Svāhā. Hum. Zha. By decree. Divine Benefit. Svāhā.*\n\nUpon completing the incantation, visualize the incense smoke ascending directly to the Dipper’s Mouth, reaching the True Dipper.\n\nNext, perform the *Tiger-Crossing-Horse Dipper* ritual: position the Dipper’s Mouth above the head, with the Dipper’s Handle pointing directly toward the Dipper’s Mouth. Visualize the petitioner’s spirit riding golden light to the Handle Star, crossing the Immortal Bridge, and arriving at the Dipper Palace. Silently state the petition, then recite the True Words:\n*Kudi. Di. She. Su. Zha. Aruo. Mi. Zha. Wu. Du. Zha. Kuqi. Zha. Polai. Di. Zha. Yewei. Ruo. Zha. Wu. Du. Zha. Kuluo. Di. Zha. Qimo. Zha. Svāhā.*\n\nConclude with the esoteric instructions for seated meditation and union with the spirit.\n\nThe petitioner gathers spirit, curls the soles of both feet inward, clasps hands in the *Thunder Crouch* mudrā, and interlocks them at the waist, closing the breath until full. Visualize the *qi* from the *Yongquan* acupoints surging upward to the *Heart Palace*, where crimson *qi* spirals and revolves. Next, with both eyes fixed upon the petitioner’s *Yintang* point, suddenly perceive an aperture opening there. Visualize the heart’s fire blazing like a flue, shooting straight through the *Yintang* point and ascending to meet the Dipper’s Mouth. From the flames, a Jade Maiden slowly emerges, her form taking shape like luminous essence. She faces the petitioner directly. Silently recite the *Great Merit Incantation* seven times, then imagine the Jade Maiden returning speech to you—thus is the connection established.\n\nPractice this union at the noon hour for three days. Thereafter, perform it at will, with the hours of *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* all being efficacious. When practicing this method, three forms of response may manifest: *written response*, *dream response*, or *ash-altar response*.\n\nFor a *written response*, first purify the body and recite the esoteric incantation in the heart. Then invoke the *Yellow Emperor of the Central Palace, Controller of Destiny and Hearth Lord*. Next, summon the *Jade Immortal Bright Essence Youth* from beneath the throne. Silently recite the *Numinous Yang Swift Response Great Merit Incantation*, form the *Li* trigram mudrā, and draw the central yellow *qi*. Blow it toward the hearth in the direction of the ritual’s intent. Take a sheet of paper and inscribe the matter at hand, the officiant affixing their seal and rolling it up. Place a brush inside, sealing it together. In a short while, the response will arrive.\n\nWhen first practicing, use the fifth *xu* day, offering a rice meal as sacrifice. Pray for transmission of the *Orthodox Mind Esoteric Canon* to a designated recipient on a specified date. For all petitions, swift responses are hoped for. Should one betray this trust, a memorial shall be submitted to the *Dipper Palace*, the *True Lord of Upholding Sageliness and Protecting Virtue*, the *Yellow Emperor of the Central Palace, Controller of Destiny and Hearth Lord*, the *Jade Immortal of the Sudden Ascent*, the *Bright Essence Youth*, and the *Venerable Alchemical Maiden*—may they clearly dispatch reproof, not through any malice of mine. If I am not sincere, may they impose punishment, and I shall harbor no resentment.\n\nFrom this day forth, this decree is made known to all. Let it be openly declared and dutifully observed.\n\n**Incantation for Purifying Body and Mind**\n*Qingyang, Qingyang, belonging to the left direction.\nAbove dwells true essence, below coalesces numinous light.\nThe Dao naturally secures the true; water wondrously merges with golden light.\nPouring into body and mind, the dharmic visualization is fulfilled.\nI now recite and unfold, harmonizing with the Dao’s resonance.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Yellow Emperor’s decree of the Central Palace.*\n\n**Numinous Yang Swift Response Six Merit Incantation**\n*Om. Hum. Zha. Śakra. Mīra. Mīra. Swift response, swift response.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the decree of the True Lord of Upholding Sageliness.*\n\nFor this incantation, form the *Li* trigram mudrā and draw the central yellow *qi*. Visualize the True Lord emerging from the Dipper Palace, appearing amidst the clouds, holding a *wish-fulfilling wheel* and commanding *Bright Essence* with hands clasped in obedience. Then imagine a stream of yellow *qi* from your own spleen meridian rising upward, merging with the cloud *qi* of the southeast. Visualize yourself transforming into a youth riding a tiger, ascending with the *qi*, uniting with the cloud-borne youth to become one. Draw this in through the mouth, then blow it onto the talisman. Burn the talisman, then place the paper and brush upon the hearth. The hearth must be kept pure, and women’s impurity, peering, or idle chatter are to be avoided. Wait two hours before retrieving the paper. If nothing is written, burn another talisman and recite the *Urgent Summons Incantation*:\n\n*Between heaven and earth, departure and abiding are not fixed.\nFor all who make supplication, swiftly descend the cinnabar ladder.\nBrush, ink, paper, and silk—grant the numinous response early.\nAs wished, as sensed, neither transgress nor disobey.\nBy imperial decree, the numinous youth swiftly descends.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the decree of the True Lord of Upholding Sageliness.*\n\n**Esoteric Incantation**\n*Tí bǔ lún □ shè.*\n\nRecite this incantation once with a single breath, three times in total.

For subsequent earnest requests, proceed in the same manner.\n\n**Esoteric Talisman**\n*Emperor Flame, Emperor Flame, Firelight’s Foremost.*\n\n**Flight through the Nine Heavens, Enveloped in Crimson Radiance**\n*Hurl fire across ten thousand leagues, spreading boundless through heaven and earth.\nReverently obey the decrees of the Fire Emperor of the South.*\n\nRecite the preceding esoteric incantation once with a single breath, three times in total.\n\n**Dream-Attaching Method**\nFor this method to convey messages in dreams, cut a child-figure from yellow paper, inscribe the talisman on its reverse, and further write: *\"Summon Bright Hero to descend swiftly. Reverently obey the decrees of the Fire Emperor of the South.\"*\n\n**Dream-Attaching Secret Method**\nWhen desiring to receive responses in dreams—whether to meet someone the following day or to seek answers regarding personal matters—one must prepare in advance by performing the incantation and visualization as previously instructed. Then, augment the ritual with the *Orthodox Invocation Esoteric Incantation*. Afterward, burn the petition silently, using a sheet of yellow paper approximately seven inches in width and length. Write in vermilion ink the details of the supplication in fine script, concluding with: *\"On such-and-such a night of this month, at such-and-such an hour, humbly beseech a clear response in dreams.\"*\n\n**Orthodox Invocation Esoteric Incantation** *(also called the Celestial Youth Incantation)*\n*Celestial Youth, Celestial Youth, stationed in the Central Palace.\nThe Maiden Spirit Lord, illuminated by imperial decree.\nTransforming her form, she rides a tiger, commanding fire dragons to descend.\nHolding a precious fan, her steps are dignified and poised.\nFor those who make earnest requests, no wish is denied.\nIn urgent matters, all is revealed within dreams.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the decrees of the Yellow Emperor.*\n\n**Ash-Altar Manifestation Method for Responses**\nAt the hour of *rending* (9–11 p.m.), use fine ash or lime to sweep clean the area before the hearth. First, arrange a Northern Dipper formation with ash, placing it inverted like the Dipper’s shape at the hearth. Then, take approximately one or two *sheng* of ash and form a circular altar beneath the Dipper. Smooth it with a chicken feather. Proceed to an open space, face the Northern Dipper, and invoke each stellar position in turn. Summon the *Upholding Sageliness* deity, then close your eyes and visualize the True Lord of the Northern Dipper descending, with the *Upholding Sageliness* from the Dipper’s Palace arriving together. Lead them back to the hearth, inviting each to sit upon the corresponding Dipper position previously arranged. Perform seven prostrations in the heart, summon *Bright Hero*, and recite the *Great Achievement Incantation* as before. Visualize *Bright Hero* descending, following the established procedure.\n\n**Manifesting Ash Traces to Reveal Secret Portents**\nMake earnest supplications as desired and await the response.\n\n**Interpretations of Ash Traces**\n- This trace indicates ancestors who have not yet ascended, for whom one seeks posthumous deliverance.\n- This trace indicates official matters not yet resolved to one’s satisfaction, or further financial loss.\n- This trace indicates betrothal or marriage for a woman, or the joy of welcoming a son-in-law into the family.\n- This trace indicates external visitors making requests, or female relatives experiencing distress.\n- This trace indicates obstacles in written matters, preventing completion.\n- This trace indicates travel or prolonged sojourn away from home, with the joy of swift return.\n- This trace indicates the addition of family members or the joy of official promotion.\n- This trace indicates unsettled enemies or minor ailments such as sores and wounds.\n- This trace indicates pregnancy among wives or concubines, or the arrival of favorable news from afar.\n- This trace indicates the joy of being summoned to court for an appointment.\n- This trace indicates receiving gifts of silk or utensils.\n- This trace indicates inauspicious deaths or the receipt of funeral notices from relatives or friends.\n- This trace indicates transactions or the escape of servants.\n- This trace indicates the joy of acquiring property or receiving offerings of treasures, or profiting from sales.\n- This trace indicates successful business ventures or the acquisition of wealth from others.\n- A tiger-patterned trace across the body indicates promotion to a position of authority.

I have vowed to act as Heaven’s proxy in transforming and benefiting beings, aiding and saving humanity. For all who make earnest supplications, I beseech responsive efficacy. Should I fail in this duty, I submit myself to the Upholding Sageliness True Lord’s sole adjudication, that my transgressions be made manifest and my errors reproved—this is no deliberate act of mine. If I am not sincere, may you, O True Lord, impose your judgment, and I shall harbor no resentment. From this day forth, this clear memorandum shall be known to both parties, its contents openly declared here, and all shall abide by its terms.\n\nNow, in accordance with proper ritual procedure, I humbly present this petition. On the [day] of the [month], during the hours of *xu* and *hai*, I shall prepare incense of sincerity and talismans of faith to invoke the presence of the Central Palace’s Yellow Thearch, the Lord of Destiny Who Oversees the Kitchen Hearth, as well as the Jade Immortals, the Radiant and Heroic Youths, and the Revered Maidens of Alchemy. I beseech you to heed the talismanic command of the Most High, hasten to this altar, expound the Daoist teachings, and swiftly bestow your divine decree, responding to prayers and manifestations as they arise. This petition is hereby formally submitted.\n\nTo the Central Palace’s Yellow Thearch, the Lord of Destiny Who Oversees the Kitchen Hearth, and the Jade Immortals, the Radiant and Heroic Youths, and the Revered Maidens of Alchemy:\nUpon receipt of this petition, may you descend by the cinnabar ladder and immediately grant your decree in accordance with its contents.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\nOn the [day] of the [month] of the [year], at the hour of [time].\n[Rank and Name] affixed.\nOrthodox Register of the Dipper Palace’s Upholding Sageliness, Preserver of Virtue, True Lord, Who Governs the Teaching of the Great Mystery and the Immortal Sages.\n\n**The Great Rite of Destiny Petition and Disaster Aversion**\n**Celestial Petition to the Dipper**\n\nThis method originated in Western Shu and is not commonly known in the world. Later, the Nine Radiant Immortals of the Zhangren Abbey in Chengdu transmitted it to the Xianzhen Abbey on Shaoshi Mountain in Jiangxi, where it spread among the people. Master passed it to disciple by oral transmission, a method for urgent petitions to the Dipper, unknown to the secular world.\n\nThe master said: The sins and blessings of humanity are all reported to the celestial authorities. In Heaven, they are governed by the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, who oversee human destiny. In the world, this office is held by the Hearth Lord. Moreover, the Lord of Destiny is the chief of the Six Spirits and the manifested agent of the Seven Primes within the Dipper. This deity records the actions of humanity, whether upright or deceitful, and on the last day of each month, ascends to Heaven to submit a complete report. Major transgressions result in the loss of life or the severing of one’s lineage, while minor offenses bring misfortune upon the self. How could one escape?\n\nIn recent times, wealthy households and noble officials, when encountering inauspicious years and suffering calamities, have sought Daoist masters and shamans to perform rites of petition and aversion. Some offer prayers to the stars, others hold grand jiao rituals, expending wealth to purchase offerings and mobilizing servants for preparations. Yet they exert no personal effort, merely providing their presence to bear witness. Among them, some fail to abstain from meat, act carelessly, or even laugh irreverently. How can they expect their prayers to be answered?\n\nThe masters of old were cultivated persons of high virtue, simple and sincere, yet their methods were inflexible. Thus, the grace of the Most High—who opens the path to deliverance and aids the living—could not be widely extended or equally bestowed, failing to universally benefit all beings. In this way, the advantage lay with the rich, not the poor. By worldly standards, those of modest means, when struck by disaster, lack the vast resources to perform such rites and can only await death helplessly—how pitiful!\n\nThe Most High cherishes all life and values contentment, whether noble or base, high or low. Yet the *Mysterious Numinous* scripture states: For the poor and lowly, who lack the means to perform grand rituals, even offering a cup of water or a single flower is dismissed as empty pretense. This is due to the world’s mediocre masters and vulgar practitioners, who refuse to humble themselves, seek teachers, or inquire into the Dao. They concern themselves only with attire, voice, and ornate implements, creating an illusion of beauty. Their practices are mere plagiarism and fabrication, deceiving later students.\n\nIn recent times, the *Mysterious Numinous* method of silent petition and the secret rites of the *River Chart* have circulated. Some obtain a few talismanic commands from its texts or memorize a few lines of esoteric incantations, yet they understand nothing of their depth. They deceive households and delude the celestial perfected, performing nothing more than lighting lamps, burning paper, and reciting dedications. The master said: If the Lord of Destiny can report humanity’s sins and blessings to Heaven, then I shall entrust this secret method to him, conveying these sentiments to the stellar heavens and petitioning on their behalf to avert disasters. The response shall be swift as shooting stars.\n\nIn my travels among the masters, I encountered a person of high attainment who transmitted to me the *Elbow-Pocket Petition to the Dipper* and other oral secrets. I have since devoted myself to its practice and repeatedly witnessed its numinous efficacy. The cost is minimal, yet its responses are timely. Regardless of gender, those facing peril should first observe three days of purification and abstinence, then perform the method with focused intention. There is no instance where the deities do not respond. The key lies in sincerity—do not harbor disrespect or act recklessly. To violate the celestial statutes is no small matter; Heaven will surely know, and disaster will follow swiftly, leaving no room for prayer.\n\nNow, in strict accordance with my master’s transmission, I set forth these instructions. For all scholars who approach this with reverence, single-minded devotion, and respectful observance, acting as Heaven’s proxy to transform and save beings, the merit is vast and beyond description. Take heed and do not neglect this.\n\n**Sequence of Practice**\nFor all practices, one must first purify body and mind through abstinence and bathing, dispelling all distracting thoughts. Each morning, burn incense, face north, sit in silent meditation for a short while, and recite the scriptures with utmost sincerity before inscribing the talismans.\n\n**Altar-Transforming Talisman**\nThis talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper, seven inches in length and three inches in width. Hold the paper in the left hand while forming the *sha* mudra, draw in the northern *qi*, and write \"Chen Renyong enters the talisman.\" Visualize the Five Numinous Officials of the Dipper’s mouth descending, and seal it with the Golden Edict character.\n\n**Talisman-Inscribing Incantation**\nThe Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper,\nGreat deities of the celestial center.\nAbove, they attend the Golden Palace;\nBelow, they cover Mount Kunlun.\nThey regulate the cosmic order,\nGoverning Heaven and Earth.\nGreat Kui, Greedy Wolf,\nGiant Gate, Wealth Repository,\nLiterary Brilliance, Integrity and Chastity,\nMartial Brilliance, Breaker of Armies.\nThey encompass the great celestial realm,\nPenetrating even the finest dust.\nWhat disaster cannot be eradicated?\nWhat blessing cannot be attained?\nThe primordial *qi* of the August Sovereign\nComes to merge with my body.\nWherever the Celestial Pivot points,\nIt revolves day and night without cease.\nThough I am a humble person,\nI seek the Dao and yearn for the numinous.\nMay I always behold your august presence\nAnd wish to preserve long life.\nThe Highest Jade Thearch,\nThe Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord.\nHasten, as the law commands!\n\n**Purification Talisman**\nThis talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper. First recite the *Purification of Heaven and Earth Incantation*, then draw in the northern *qi* to infuse the talisman.\n\n**Incantation of the Great Dipper Deities**\nThe Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper,\nWhose *qi* governs the heavens.\nThe Great Sage of the Celestial Pivot,\nWhose majestic radiance is boundless.\nAbove Heaven and below Earth,\nThey sever the roots of all evil.\n\nAscend upon the clouds to descend before the altar.\nDescending with true *qi*, piercing water and entering mist.\nTransmitted through the Three Realms,\nAll demons bow in submission.\nSevering demons and erasing traces,\nTurning death into ascension to immortality.\nHasten, as the law commands!\n\n**Inscribing the Dipper**\nFor each star, visualize the Celestial Star Palace descending a thread of true *qi*. The master inhales it through the nose and gently exhales it into the star of the Dipper. Then, inscribe the Dipper’s taboo name upon the crane’s back, recite the Sanskrit incantation to anoint it, and draw in the *qi* of each star.\n\n**Sanskrit Incantation of the Dipper’s Great Deities**\n*Ju zhi di she su cha a ruo mi cha wu du cha ju qi cha bo lai di cha ye wei ruo cha wu du cha ju luo di cha qi mo cha sa ha.*\n\n**Talisman for Deliverance from Calamity**\nVisualize the afflicted person standing before the altar. Next, visualize a golden elixir descending from the Dipper and entering the sufferer’s body. Then inscribe the talisman, adding a command character and the afflicted person’s name to anoint it. Cover it with the Dipper, facing upward toward the Dipper’s palace, the Bureau of Exorcising Disasters and Delivering from Calamity, to substitute for the sufferer’s bodily misfortunes.\n\nNext recite:\nThe numinous nodes flourish,\nWishing to preserve long life.\nThe Supreme Mystery’s One,\nGuarding and protecting the body’s form.\nThe spirit lords of the Five Viscera,\nEach safeguarding peace.\nHasten, as the law commands!\n\n**Incantation**\nThe Supreme Numinosity of the Nine Palaces,\nThe Great One guards the chamber.\nA hundred spirits stand in solemn defense,\nSoul and spirit harmonized as one.\nLong life and enduring vision,\nSealing and extinguishing evil and misfortune.\nOne yin and one yang,\nForever preserving auspicious prosperity.\nHasten, as the law commands!\n\n**Method for Interpreting Lamp Omens**\nFlickering dimly: celestial disaster.\nLamp bright and undying: great fortune.\nTwo flames of unequal length: old vows stirring.\nFlower-like beads suspended: great fortune.\nHalf black, half red: slander and strife.\nFlame wavering unsteadily: chronic illness.\nTears of black soot: great misfortune and mourning.\nLeft side elongated: disaster for a yang person.\nRight side elongated: disaster for a yin person.\nRed lamp flower: loss of wealth.\nWhite lamp flower: loss or separation.\nPale blue-white lamp flower: ancestral spirits unsettled.\nExploding without light: change in the patient’s condition.\nLamp flame leaping to all four sides: malevolent spirits or wandering ghosts causing harm.\n\n**Dream Interpretation for Verification**\nSunrise: male patient may recover, female patient’s condition lightens.\nMoonrise: female patient half-fortunate, male patient otherwise.\nFire appears: red flame auspicious, darkness inauspicious.\nGreat serpent: half-misfortune, household troubled by malevolent spirits.\nBirds or beasts: patient’s condition fluctuates.\nSnakes or rats: earth spirits unsettled.\nDogs running: ancestral spirits causing harm.\nWoman in white: Dipper immortals descending.\nPerson in blue: moderate fortune.\nPerson in yellow: earth spirits causing disaster.\nPerson in black: life exhausted, spirits pursuing.\nPerson in red: mountain spirits coming to claim or confront.\nEntering an official residence or house and seeing a woman: Dipper immortals descend to resolve calamity.\nEntering a temple: minor yin misfortune, perform rites to ensure safety.\nBathing: disaster or loss.\nBright as daylight: golden brilliance, great fortune, patient’s condition may improve.\nDogs or horses: ancestral graves unsettled.\nDarkness across the sky: patient’s condition will not improve.\nFlying crows: local earth spirits causing harm.\nOxen or swine: epidemics or malarial fevers.\nCrows or chickens: inauspicious, unexpected misfortune may arise.\nNo dream: patient gravely ill and unconscious, no change also inauspicious.\n\n**Fumigation and Stove Inspection**\nObserve the stove: ants, centipedes, flying moths, or frogs indicate earth spirits or local shrines.\nOther auspicious or inauspicious signs are to be interpreted with discernment.\nStove purification and written petitions follow standard forms.\n\n**Procedure for Ritual Practice**\nFirst, have someone sweep and clean the stove area. Then proceed according to the prescribed method. Place a lamp inside the wok and cover it with a rice sieve, ensuring no layperson or woman sees it.\n\n*Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Forty-Two* concludes.\n*Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Forty-Three* begins.\n\n**Great Rites of the Supreme Mystery for the Ghost-Gate Marshal #1**\n\n**Marshal Guan of the Northern Emperor’s Fengdu Demon-Subduing Judiciary**\nThe Great Ghost-Gate Marshal of the Northern Emperor’s Fengdu, Slayer of Demons and Executioner of Judgment, bears the taboo name *Yu* and the style *Yunchang*.

Within the azure *qi*, the Marshal appears—draw in the secret syllable to the Gallbladder Palace, where Ancestral *Qi* merges with golden light, surging in thunderous resonance. Wood *qi* invades Earth; golden light assails Wood. Envision the Primordial Master employing the three syllables *yàn xī yí*, as the Marshal’s majestic presence blazes forth. Arriving at the altar’s left, he manifests before you. Recite the heart mantra:\n\n*Hū hūṃ mó xī shè.*\n\nRepeat the rightward mantra seven times in a single breath, directing intent as the matter requires.\n\n**Personal Talisman:**\n*A single iron rod, a thousand catties in weight—*\n*Strikes down all unrighteous spirits under Heaven.*\n\nTrace the talisman with the brush: slash the *shè* character toward *Kūn*, then strike outward toward *Sì*; slash the *shè* character toward *Gèn*, aligning with the Dipper and the Sacred Peaks.\n\n**Secret Mantra:**\n*□ dispatch □ summon □□ sound Yī—*\n*Expel baleful *qi* □□ where it lingers, pacify □□—*\n*Heavenly Stars □ Earthly Luminaries, respond to the Purple Tenuity □ True King □ Sacred Peak’s command □□.*\n\n*Oṃ hū lú lī zhà fèi □□□ xī □ qián bì lī zhà □ Wēn Qióng jí shè.*\n\n**Ignite.**\n\nProclaim before the Marshal: proceed to so-and-so’s household to seize and capture.

Recite: *Swiftly, swiftly, in the name of the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai, Heavenly Culmen, Benevolent and Sacred Emperor, by statute and command—seize!*\n\nUpon completing the recitation, let out a great shout—*hūng*—and with both hands, inscribe the Greater Yang and Lesser Yin, rubbing them together to generate warmth. Then circulate the Water and Fire within the body, ascending and descending to merge them, and with a clap of thunder, strike them into the talisman. Stamp the left foot once upon the earth, and with both hands form the *zǐ* mudra, passing the thumb over the four fingers to complete the seal. Circulate the union of Kidney and Heart toward the Heart, and with another thunderclap, strike it into the talisman.\n\nIn matters of utmost urgency, incorporate this text into the talisman along with the taboo name of the Peak. Recite: *Swiftly, swiftly, by the authority of the Lady of Primordial Mystery and Serene Stability, Zhang Shidao Hui, entrusted to her son Wen [so-and-so], in accordance with the Tiger’s Mouth mandate—enforce!*\n\nInscribe the □ character by hand and recite the preceding text. Whenever Marshal Wen is summoned to a household to sweep away violent demons and malevolent influences, or to dispel pestilential *qi* during epidemics, infuse this Five-Thunder talisman. There shall be a response from the Hidden Thunder, and the demonic spirits will retreat of their own accord.\n\nUpon completing the inscription, recite the four characters *Oṃ hūṃ lú zhà* into the talisman. At its center, inscribe a single character, visualizing within the ancestral *qi* another character, resplendent with golden light. Then summon the Five Thunders in the form of boar-headed figures, each bearing a royal drum, advancing from the *Kūn* Palace to converge upon the character atop the incense. Merge them into one, then draw them into the talisman with a single inhalation. Employ the Heavenly Canopy Mantra to dispatch them: ㄇ. As before, use both hands to perform the mudra, shout with thunderous force, and strike the seal into the talisman, forming the Eight Points of Gold. What are the Eight Points of Gold? They are the eight encircling strokes.\n\n*Command and restrain the Earth Deities:*\n*Oṃ.*\n\nInvoking the Creative Power to Subdue and Seize:\n*Oṃ hūṃ lú zhà* □ *zhà lǐ chì* □ *lǐ lǐ jī xī.*\n\nI invoke the Thunderous Might to subdue and seize.\nThe Three Heavens’ Great Saints, the Four Sagely Primordial Lords.\nHeavenly Canopy, Heavenly Canopy, Nine Mysterious Subduing Youths.\nCelestial Pivot and Earthly Axis lie within my grasp.\nThe Five Ding Generals, Gao Diao and Northern Elder.\nThe Seven Governors and Eight Spirits, the Supreme White Might.\nLong-skulled Beasts of Vast Proportions, wielding the Emperor’s Bell.\nThe Three White Owls, sternly mounted upon Kui Dragons.\nMighty Sword Spirit-Kings, severing evil and eradicating traces.\nPurple *qi* ascends the heavens, cinnabar clouds surge forth.\nDevouring demons and consuming ghosts, their bodies stretched across the wind.\nGreen-tongued and jade-toothed, the Four-Eyed Elder.\nHeavenly Ding Warriors, warding off misfortune from the south.\nHeavenly Couriers, fierce and wrathful, bearing blades from the north.\nThree hundred thousand troops encircle and guard my ninefold layers.\nExpelling corpses a thousand *li* away, driving off all inauspiciousness.\nShould any petty ghost dare appear,\nthe Heaven-Splitting Great Axe shall sever its fivefold form.\nThe Fiery Emperor’s scorching blood, the Northern Dipper’s burning bones.\nThe Four Luminaries shatter its remains, the Heavenly Plan annihilates its kind.\nWith a single stroke of the divine blade, ten thousand ghosts scatter.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Father, the Numinous Might, the Venerable Spirit, the Primordial Void, the Great Marshal commands to subdue and seize.\n*Mì mì lǐ.*\nBind swiftly, seize without delay.\nMountain specters, *wangliang*, the Five Pestilences, the Six Afflictions—fifteen kinds in all—wayward spirits and perverse demons, swiftly beclouded and bewildered, seized.\nRectify the Mechanism, align the *Gang* and *Heng*, guard the Pattern.\n\n*Right Mudra:*\nFrom the root of the thumb, proceed through *yín*, *mǎo*, *chén*, and *sì*, then press the subduing pattern. Tracing the Dipper and severing the *Gang* is also efficacious.\n*Hū* pertains to the *qi* of liver and gallbladder; the Celestial *Gang* resides in *chén*.\n\nAfter inscribing the talisman, seal this secret within. Then inscribe again a *Kui* Dipper, and recite the *Dharani* of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Star Lords.\nTo safeguard the prosperity of the six livestock, employ the Heavenly Canopy Mantra to dispatch them.\nFor treating swine and cattle plagues, append the three characters *xū*, *xiàng*, *xié*.\nIn ordinary use, this tabooed brilliance need not be employed.\nIn urgent matters, use the Fire Dipper; its awe-inspiring power manifests instantly.\n\n**The Five *Qi* Transformations:**\nWood flourishes in spring as the East, its color green, its *qi* harmonious, corresponding to the liver’s *xū*.\nFire flourishes in summer as the South, its color red, its *qi* hot, corresponding to the heart’s *hē*.\nMetal flourishes in autumn as the West, its color white, its *qi* solemn, corresponding to the lungs’ *sì*.\nWater flourishes in winter as the North, its color black, its *qi* cold, corresponding to the kidneys’ *chuī*.\nEarth, lodged in the flourishing of the four seasons, is the Center, its color yellow, its *qi* warm, corresponding to the spleen’s *pēng*.\n\n**Transmission of the Perfected Void Heavenly Master’s Shape-Shifting Talisman:**\nInscribe the character for \"subduing ghosts,\" envisioning the brush as a halberd, subduing three thousand *li* of stern subduing officials and soldiers, entering the well and emerging again with the brush.\n*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ tāo tāo xī qīng líng gāng jué Oṃ* □ *sū zhà chì shā shè zǐ wǔ.*\n*Oṃ xīn hūṃ zǔ gōng zhà dǎn lǐ*, exhale through the nose, inhale through the mouth, stamp the left foot upon the ground, and shake with fury to expel.\nBy the Great Honored Emperor’s command, the Eight-Headed Primordial Lord issues the decree.\nNine times, visualize a golden wheel of light, with all the generals manifest within.\nEnvision the solar wheel in the heart, emitting the character *yì*; envision the lunar wheel in the kidney palace, luminous and clear, emitting the character *zhá* to ascend the gallbladder vase.\n\n**Seated Practice:**\nAt dawn and dusk, sit in stillness, unstained by a single speck of dust, all thoughts silenced. For three cycles of seven, raise both palms, and knock the teeth nine times.\n\n**Application of the Void-Day Rat:**\nAvoid the *Yàn* and *Wēi* months.\nRub the palms together, uniting the water and fire *qi*. Upon seeing a sun-like orb of light in the left palm, recite the *Dharani* of the Taiyin’s Transformation, the Heavenly Canopy Mantra, and the Heart Mantra forty-nine times. Envision *Wēn Qióng* manifesting within the light of the right palm, and silently petition for the matter at hand. Recite the Heavenly Canopy Mantra, and draw the light into the gallbladder. Then draw nine breaths of the Eastern green *qi* into the gallbladder, envisioning it as a lapis lazuli vase, within which the tortoise and snake intertwine, coalescing into a golden orb of light like a silver pearl. Exhale it onto the incense, round as a bright mirror, within which Marshal *Wēn* appears.\n\n*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls*, Scroll Forty-Three concludes:\n#1 *The Great Law of the Dark Mystery’s Ghost-Subduing Marshal*: Transmitted by the Northern Emperor.\n#2 *The Great Law of the Earth Deity Marshal Wēn*: Transmitted by the Northern Emperor.\n\n*Compendium of Daoist Methods*, Scroll 254, *Secret Methods for Summoning and Examining the Eastern Marchmount’s Marshal Wēn*, Preface to the Numinous Text states:\nMarshal *Wēn* is the Eastern Marchmount’s Commander of Troops, the Celestial Inspector General of the World, and the Keeper of Urgent Human Cases. His might and strange manifestations are unparalleled; whatever is petitioned, none fails to meet the heart’s desire.\nDuring the Tang, at the request of the Heavenly Master *Yè Fǎshàn*, he was entrusted with governing the ghosts of pestilence. \"To save a sick father, the people of Shu were all cured within a month. Later, he manifested again, saying: 'I wish to assist the world’s ritual officers in their practice, capturing malevolent spirits and curing illnesses. Now, I possess secret talismanic methods; I hope they will be propagated.'\" Heavenly Master *Yè* thus transmitted this method to later disciples. In the space of a breath, its responses were resoundingly clear.\nThe same work’s *Great Law of the Earth Deity Marshal Wēn* belongs to the same lineage and serves as a mutual reference.\n\n*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls*, Scroll Forty-Four:\n*The Great Law of Marshal Yīn, Inspector of the Earth Bureau*\n\nThe Master of the Law is the Patriarch, Immortal Lord of Southern Prosperity, *Liào Zhēnrén*. The Marshal in Command: *Yīn Yuánshuài*, the Earth Bureau’s Inspector of the Year-Star, Supreme Virtue of the Northern Culmen’s Divine Presence, who aids the Dao, annihilates essences, and extirpates demons—his name is *Jiāo*. He appears as a youthful visage, with a green face, red hair, twin topknots bound in a coiled headwrap, a cyan body, bare legs, clad in a black-green crimson robe, a red skirt cinched at the waist, and a necklace of twelve skulls. In his left hand, he holds a golden bell; in his right, a yellow halberd. Stout and short, he stands amidst black clouds, with a yellow banner and leopard-tail attendants flanking him.\n\nThe Deputy Marshal: *Jiǎng Shǐzhě*, the Swift-Seizing Evocator of the Dipper’s Numinous Manifestation—his name is *Ruì*. He resembles a *Kinnara* king: fanged, crimson-lipped, barefoot, with large golden rings in his ears. His complexion is purple or green-faced, with a headband, red hair, a floral red robe, and upturned boots. He wields a noose, with *gongcao* officials at his side.\n\nThe Yellow Banner General: *Lú Míng*.\nThe Leopard-Tail General: *Lǐ Zhòngwén*.\nThe Yellow Halberd General: *Guān Lóng*.\nThe Golden Bell General: *Chén Tuòjī*.\nThe Nine-*Qi* General of the East: *Gōng Wénwáng*.\nThe Three-*Qi* General of the South: *Zhāng Zōngyì*.\nThe Seven-*Qi* General of the West: *Xīmén Bào*.\nThe Five-*Qi* General of the North: *Wú Zhèngwén*.\nThe Central *Qi*-Governing General: *Liú Zhōng*.\nThe Seventy-Two Seasonal Sovereign Generals: *Sòng Wénxíng*.\nThe Twenty-Four *Qi* Generals: *Hán Bǎo*.\n\nThis method seizes the Three *Qi* and Nine *Liáng*, dispels the Five Pestilences and Six Afflictions.\n\n**Summoning Incantation:**\nFierce officers of the Year-Star, marshaling all spirits,\nWith the yellow banner leading, the leopard-tail following,\nThe seventy-two seasons, the twenty-four *qi*,\nMalevolent *sha* at the fore, baleful gods as guards.\nThe yellow halberd executes essences; the golden bell strikes *sui*.\nEnvoys of the Five Directions, potent and awe-inspiring.\nBy the Emperor’s decree, descend swiftly,\nAid my great Dao, sweep away demonic essences.\nWhoever resists the Dao shall be beheaded and presented.\nBy the statutes of *Xuándū*, slay ghosts without delay.\n*Hasten! Hasten!* In accordance with the statutes of the Northern Culmen’s Purple Tenuity Great Emperor.\n\n**Decree:** Summon *Yīn Jiāo*, the fierce officer of the Earth Bureau under the Northern Emperor of Supreme Clarity, to arrive swiftly. *Hasten!*\n\nGaze into the yellow *qi* of the central heavens; the master’s eyes inscribe the characters *Yīn Jiāo*, then blow them into the clouds—the Marshal appears. Draw him into the spleen palace to merge, then exhale before the altar. Blow toward the northeast, where the union is absent, and together with Marshal *Jiǎng*, they manifest instantly. *Nì.*\n\n**Mantra:** *Oṃ hūṃ* [syllables obscured] *vam*, the incantation of subjugation.\n\n**Gèn *Qi* Blow:** Seal and fix [obscured] *heavenly hail, earthly* [obscured] *human* [obscured].\n\n**Marshal’s Talisman:**\nBy decree of the Northern Culmen, summon *Yīn Jiāo* swiftly.\nAll gods bear the command—slay ghosts, devour essences.\nWhoever resists shall die. By the Emperor’s decree.\n*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ*, incantation of the fierce officers of the Year-Star, applied in black ink.\n*Nì*, used in conjunction with the Year-Star of the current year’s cyclical sign.\n**Secret Incantation.**\n\nBy the Emperor’s decree, *Yīn Jiāo* shall universally save all beings, drive out evil and malevolence, and swiftly hasten to the altar. *Yīn Jiāo*, Marshal of the Origin, hasten to the altar—by breath you shall respond, swiftly descend, and urgently report. Hasten to act without delay.\n\n**Examination and Binding:**\nMay the sun, moon, and stars swiftly shift the soul. With the Dipper mudra in the left hand and the sword mudra in the right, visualize the body from crown to feet, reciting the invocation to the numinous generals of heaven and earth to gather and seize the soul. From the feet, reverse the sword mudra upward to the crown, imagining the Three Hun in the form of Daoist adepts—azure, yellow, and white—emerging from the crown in sequence with the sword mudra. Press the tongue against the upper palate to form a golden bridge, then inhale, drawing the three adepts into the golden tower and jade hall within the master’s abdomen. Immediately command the officers and clerks to press the case into the body.\n\n**Thunder chariots and thunderclaps, the Water Spirit Generals.**\nWhen malevolence enters the yang body, it becomes as cool as ice. The heavenly generals conduct internal interrogation, compelling it to reveal its name.\n\n**Hasten! Hasten! As the Emperor’s statutes and decrees command.**\n\n**Talisman for Reporting Offenders:**\nInscribe the three decrees on the front and affix the subsequent talisman on the reverse.\n\n**Breaking Ground:**\n*Huò líng líng* [syllables obscured] *tiān xīng* [obscured] *dì yào*, *niè*—commonly used for dispersing miasmic harmony to cure pestilence. Cut paper into an octagon, inscribe the talisman, and affix it outside. Take a piece of cat bamboo, one foot and two inches long (add one inch in a leap month), inscribe the talisman upon it, and strike the offending direction forty-nine times with an axe while reciting the *Yù Gào* once, until it is exhausted. Then dispatch the *chén* and *xū* Dipper, alternating *xū* and *chén*, followed by the stars *Poverty, Giant, Wealth, Literature, Humility, Military, Ruin*.\n\nFor clandestine repairs, affix the talisman to the eastern pillar of the ridgepole, then strike the ground at the breaking point three times with an axe. When moving earth, affix the talisman to the worksite and dig three times at the starting point.\n\nFor celestial pestilence, first offer thanks, then perform the exorcism using the talisman as prescribed. For terrestrial pestilence caused by breaking ground or laying foundations, where the household’s lamps and fires dim, appeal to Marshal *Tǔ Huáng* of the Origin, taking soil from the direction where the earth was disturbed and casting it into the altar.\n\nFor ship pestilence, issue a document and dispatch the talisman at will. For prison pestilence, send the marshals to oversee the city god’s seizure. For livestock pestilence, inscribe a bamboo slip and place it in the pen, then strike the talisman into vinegar and charcoal to restore peace.\n\nTo recover runaway servants, inscribe the talisman and affix it upside-down above the stove—it will appear at once. For lost cats or dogs, inscribe the talisman on white paper and affix it above the stove—they will appear at once.\n\nTo cure malevolence, inscribe the talisman on an iron plaque and drive it in with nails. For insects or birds damaging crops, dispatch the local earth god.\n\n**Right:** Each of these methods requires three impressions of the master’s seal, stamped in sequence to summon and employ agents at will. For major matters, submit a memorial and issue a document with the dispatch talisman. Generally, adjust the prayers according to the situation, then affix the three decrees and seal them. On the reverse of the three-decree talisman, inscribe *Hé Míng Tiān Dì Rì* (\"Conjoined Radiance of Heaven and Earth\"). An octagonal talisman may be used, affixed to the four directions.\n\n**Earth Bureau Talisman and Seal:**\nThe octagonal talisman appears in the master’s method.\n\n**First Marshal:** Zhang Quan\n**Second Marshal:** Yu You\n**Third Marshal:** Hou Biao\n**Fourth Marshal:** Geng Tong\n**Fifth Marshal:** Xue Wen\n**Sixth Marshal:** Wu Wen\n**Seventh Marshal:** Zhao Yu\n**Eighth Marshal:** He Chong\n**Ninth Marshal:** Feng Li\n**Tenth Marshal:** Lu De\n**Eleventh Marshal:** Luo Dawen\n**Twelfth Marshal:** He Zhong\n\n**Iron Barrier Talisman**\n**Inner Talisman of the Eight Marshals:**\nZhang, Huang, Qiu, Li, Zhao, Xu, Lü, Yu\n**Outer Talisman of the Eight Marshals for Healing Illness:**\nTalisman of Marshal Xu, Heavenly Physician\nTalisman of Marshal Tian, Commander of the Five Thunders\nTalisman of Marshal Po Huo Cui Jiang, Breaker of Fire and Hastener of Thunder\nTalisman of General Liu, Catcher of Mountain Demons\nTalisman of General Tao, Commander of the Five Thunders’ Cangues and Tortures\nTalisman of Gao Tian Ding, Hastener of Birth—add the woman’s name\nTalisman of the Five Thunders for Curing Myriad Illnesses\n*By the Supreme Decree: Fierce Officers with Silver Fangs, Guard the Upright Qi, Scour and Cleanse Malevolent Spirits*\n*Open the Gate of Heaven, Seal the Door of Earth, Detain the Living, Unblock the Paths of Ghosts, Pierce the Ghost’s Heart, Shatter the Ghost’s Belly*\n□□□□□□□□□□□□□□\n*Upper Prime: Heavenly Officials gaze toward Qian to draw the qi of the Gate of Heaven*\n*Middle Prime: Earthly Officials draw the qi of the central Xun*\n*Lower Prime: Water Officials draw the qi of the northern Zi*\n*The True Qi of the Five Stars and the Five Phases Formula*\n*In the East, Thunder and Fire ignite*\n*In the South, Thunder and Fire ignite*\n*In the West, Thunder and Fire ignite*\n*In the North, Thunder and Fire ignite*\n*In the Center, Thunder and Fire ignite*\n*Heavenly Officials pierce ghosts*\n*Earthly Officials suppress ghosts*\n*Water Officials behead ghosts*\n*The Dao transforms into numinous power, numinous power transforms into qi, qi transforms into spirits, spirits transform into forms*\n*By Imperial Decree, descend swiftly!*\n\nInscribe the talisman on yellow paper to summon Marshal Xu, the Heavenly Physician.\n\n**Two Talismans for the Three Malevolent Forces**\n\n**Two Talismans for Reporting to the Grand Year-Star**\n\n**Talisman of the Envoy for Resolving Curses**\n**Talisman for Releasing Grievances and Delivering Souls**\n**Talisman for Reporting to the Earthly Mansion**\n**Talisman for Dispelling Livestock Plagues**\n**Talisman for Pacifying the Controller of Destiny**\n**Incantation for Summoning the Deputy Marshal**\n\n*I enact the method of the Most High,*\n*To search and seize all demonic essences.*\n*At my call, appear at once;*\n*At my touch, instantly commune with the numinous.*\n*Should any dare defy or delay,*\n*Calamity shall befall your very selves.*\n\n*With reverence, I summon the Manifestly Responsive, Numinously Communicative, Swift-Seizing Envoy Jiang Rui—hasten here!*\n\n*Oṃ āḥ va[ ] nī [ ] hūṃ.*\n\nRecite the incantation thrice, dispatching it to the Zi-Wu Dipper.

creation,\nBalance and regulate yin and yang,\nSever and cast down demonic stars,\nVerify talismans and observe correspondences.\n\nFor example, the *Liúhuǒ* (Flowing Fire) baleful star is the Great Yang.\nThe *Jīnhǔ* (Golden Tiger) great slayer is governed by the Celestial Stem—\nThis is the star of the Western *Tàibái* (Venus), the flowing metal,\nPresided over by the Great Yin, the thunder-slayer.\nThe *Hēiléi* (Black Thunder) and *Léihǔ* (Thunder Tiger) slayers\nAre the gods of the *Fāntiān Fùdì* (Heaven-Overturning, Earth-Covering) slayer.\nWhen the talismanic mandate of the *Liúhuǒ* baleful star offends the *Jīnhǔ*,\nIt responds through the black slayer of thunder and rain.\nThis star pertains to metal, that talisman to fire—\nThe principle of fire overcoming metal.\n\nThe gods of *Fāntiān Fùdì*\nAre to be met with the flying-sword talisman for severing corpses.\nTo offend them is to slay and subdue the thunder master’s family.\nCover and shield with the Heavenly Emperor’s command,\nOr the ritual master will suffer the calamity.\nMoreover, on *jiǎ-sì* days,\nWhen the dragon soars and the rooster crows at dawn,\nArriving at the land of *Hēiléi*, *Hēihǔ*, and *Jīnhǔ*,\nIt is especially swift and efficacious.\n\nGenerally, when the Grand Year resides in its palace, arise,\nSeek the dwelling of the thunder-slayer,\nAnd shoot it with the thunder arrow—this is critical.\nEach arrow has its own method of activation and diagram.\n\n**Procedures for Mobilization**\nFor example, if the response is due on a certain day,\nThe day prior, seek the direction of the *Liúhuǒ* White Tiger.\nThen summon with the master’s own talisman.\nUpon arrival, visualize each spirit’s attire and colors,\nOffer tea, and state the purpose.\n\nNext, circulate the Nine Qi and blow upon the blade,\nSlaughter the chicken with the right hand holding the knife,\nThe left hand cutting, dripping blood into the wine vessel *bǐng*.\nPlace the chicken in the baleful direction.\nAgain, circulate the Nine Qi into the wine,\nSpray the chicken toward the *Liúhuǒ* White Tiger’s direction,\nAnd command: *Liúhuǒ* White Tiger,\nAt such-and-such day and hour, manifest the great response!\n\nPrepare four documents:\nInscribe the Jade Emperor’s decree,\nFire Earl’s talisman,\nThunder character talisman,\nNine Qi talisman—\nFour talismanic mandates, divided into eight pieces.\nFour pieces affixed to the front of the documents,\nThe remaining four reserved for summoning the generals at the altar.\n\nFor the document to the altar’s official generals,\nUse one Fire Earl’s talisman, divided into two pieces,\nApplied as before.\nInscribe notes on the reverse for efficacy.\nThen, facing the direction of the direct talisman, burn it,\nSummon the direct talisman, and present the memorial text,\nSubmitting it to the respective offices.\n\nAlso prepare a Grand Year document,\nCommanding the leadership of this year’s flourishing qi,\nWhite Tiger, *Liúhuǒ* official talismans,\nSword, Vermilion Bird, and the Four Thunder Arrows,\nTo arise in such-and-such direction,\nRaising clouds and spitting mist,\nGreatly shaking the thunderous sound.\nWhen the matter is complete and the merit accomplished,\nDo not forget to report and requite.\n\nAffix a complete Grand Year talisman to the front of the document,\nBurn it toward the Grand Year’s direction.\nAt the appointed hour, observe the White Tiger’s direction for activation.\nReturn to pacify and circulate the scriptures.\nAt dawn, observe whether qi is present.\nPrepare four recall-slayer talismans,\nSecretly burn them together in the incense burner—\nThe response will surely be great.\n\nIf the qi is black and the slayer’s arrival fierce,\nHastily burn the resolution talisman in the burner.\nAfter a moment, transform it into a sudden fire,\nPress the thunder talisman, and urge the thunder and rain unceasingly.\n\nFor *liù-yǐ* mobilizations,\nPrepare a summons the day prior, and burn it at the appointed time.\nIf unresponsive, next use the *xīn* talisman to urge the summons,\nThen the *dèng* talisman to urge the summons.\n\nNext, observe the Thunder Bureau issuing its command. Examine where the day’s *sha* direction lies, then proceed to that direction to plant the banner and take position. Thereafter, circulate the scriptures to summon the Five Thunder Celestial Stem Metal Terrace Generals—Earth, Metal, Water, and the Moon’s Water.\n\n*Sever the rainbow, slay the demonic miasma—by imperial decree, their bodies shall be severed inch by inch.

that plague human breath, none is more grievous than consumptive wasting. No physician or shaman in the world can cure it. Once one person falls ill, the malady spreads through the entire clan, even to the point of extinguishing the family line. None dare approach, hence it is called \"corpse-transmitted consumption.\" Some burn the dead in the mountains and wilds; others cast them into rivers, refusing burial. Descendants sever ties of bone and flesh; husbands and wives lose the bond of mutual regard. How tragic indeed!\n\nThose who treat this illness fail to suppress the Three Corpses and Nine Worms. Talismans prove ineffective—how could mere physicians or shamans succeed? Now, a treasured secret is revealed, to be imparted only to those deemed worthy, transmitted through the heart. If one whose nature and conduct are not gentle and sincere obtains this text without the master’s guidance, recklessly practices it, or carelessly divulges it, the calamity will extend to nine generations—an unforgivable sin. Beware, beware!\n\nHouseholds afflicted by this malady must submit a written petition to the altar, declaring their life’s origin and detailing when the illness began and its present symptoms. If they experience inauspicious nightmares or see ghosts of deceased kin, they must clearly describe these omens. Upon verification of the worms’ presence through talismanic fumigation, a memorial is submitted to the Celestial Emperor and the Ancestral Master, dispatching generals to seize the corpse-transmitting ghosts and the wrongfully deceased kin. After imprisonment and interrogation, talismans are issued to expel the corpse-worms.\n\nAfter ingesting the talisman, within twenty-one days the disease’s source is expelled. If the body sweats and itches as though worms crawl beneath the skin, swiftly wipe the entire body with cloth and burn it. Some may vomit worm-like forms; others may experience abdominal rumbling and pain, followed by diarrhea. The talisman’s power, infused with thunder-fire and lethal qi, incinerates the corpse-worms, leaving no chance of escape. The worms vary in form, but once the disease’s source is expelled, place them in a vessel and cast it into flowing water.\n\nThen, administer the *Report-and-Response Talisman* to determine which organ is depleted, and use the *Tonifying Talisman* to restore what was damaged. For those with qi and blood stagnation, it is also essential to cultivate a calm mind and nurture their nature, avoiding overexertion. The method requires eighty days of treatment, and after a thousand days, the body is purged—such a person is reborn into the world. If they fail to abstain from the bedchamber or regulate their activities appropriately, survival remains uncertain. The utmost care must be taken, as with a woman in childbirth. Without proper nurturing, if the illness recurs, the danger is grave.\n\nTransmitted by Yan Daolong, styled Zilong, of the Tianpeng lineage.\n\nThe method for pursuing and eradicating consumption is indeed the most secret text of Heaven and a rare treasure in the world below. Yet today’s practitioners, without examining the root, merely grasp at the branches, vainly attempting to practice it. I first studied under Master Wu Youkai, who received the transmission from Guo Jundaguan. Guo’s master was Chen Zangxiu, whose master was Guo Jun Huangxi, a disciple of Fan Xuan. Though I obtained this transmission, I remained uncertain whether the root and branches were complete.\n\nMy neighbor, Master Xueya, received the lineage from Fan Xuan. Having traversed rivers and lakes, he was a pioneer in this art, reviving the dead and saving lives beyond count. In his later years, he returned home, and I became his disciple. How rare is such a text! I served my master for years, fulfilling the duties of a disciple, even providing his burial shroud and coffin. Fan Xuan, pleased with my devotion, imparted all the profound mysteries of the methods.\n\nFor over forty years, I wandered rivers and lakes, and the efficacy of my master’s teachings was as responsive as an echo. Though many sought the Dao, few were deemed worthy of transmission. As the saying goes: \"Disciples seek masters easily, but masters seek disciples with difficulty.\" This is no idle claim.\n\nMoreover, today’s practitioners often corrupt talismans and incantations, rendering them flawed and erroneous. When applied to healing, no response is received. Is the method itself inefficacious? No—it is the failure of transmission. At seventy, I met you, who have studied diligently and whose aspirations are admirable. I shall fully transmit the master’s teachings to propagate the true doctrine.\n\nTo future learners: unless you offer gold and treasures, pledge your devotion, and swear before Heaven and Earth, do not lightly divulge this. This is my wish and the fortune of the method. I, Yuanchang, have faithfully upheld my master’s transmission, and its efficacy in practice has long been known. Thus, I compile this volume as a treasured inheritance for saving the world. Should later scholars obtain this text, cherish and practice it, and the ranks of immortals may be attained. To carelessly divulge or profane it invites severe retribution from the Mysterious Tribunal. May the generals and officials of the Ancestral Master bear witness.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Zhang Yuanchang, fourth-generation descendant of the Tianpeng lineage.\n\n*The Origins of the Tianpeng Lineage*\n\nLong ago, the lineage’s founder, Master Pinlefeng, suffered from consumption. In a dream, a divine being said: \"Seek the true immortals of Mount Hua, and your illness may be cured.\" The master ascended the mountain and resided there for over two months, but his condition worsened. The mountain’s Daoists, fearing his death, refused him lodging. Leaning on his staff, he descended, and halfway down the slope, exhausted, he sat. Suddenly, three Daoists appeared and asked: \"Why are you here?\" The master explained his plight. The Daoists replied: \"Return to the mountain. I have a prescription beneath the seat of the Perfected Wang. Seek Lu Yanghao, and memorialize your illness—it will soon be cured.\" With that, they vanished.\n\nThe master marveled and returned to the mountain. Beneath the seat of the Perfected Wang, he indeed found the text. Lu Yanghao had just ascended the mountain, and the master had him copy and memorialize it. His illness was immediately cured. Thereafter, the master practiced this method among rivers and lakes, achieving manifest responses, and many sought the Dao.\n\nIn truth, this transmission employs the Four Generals of the Dharma’s Expedient Methods and the Four Immortals of Mount Shenshan as its foundation, establishing a method to deliver people, called the *Four Generals*. The *Purple Court* incorporates common medicinal herbs like *Yi* and *Qi*, which also prove efficacious.\n\nAt that time, Yan Tongpan of Fuzhou, styled Jing’an, established a Daoist abbey to welcome masters of the Dao from across the land. One day, the master arrived, and Yan received him with great courtesy.\n\nJing’an’s younger brother, Fan Yuanxuan, served him with even greater reverence. The master, pleased by his devotion and recognizing his aptitude for receiving the Dao, transmitted this method to him. Yuanxuan practiced it with remarkable efficacy, though he had yet to deliver others. In his later years, beset by worldly upheavals and family poverty, he relocated to Lixian Township in Chongren, beneath an osmanthus tree on Huolu Ridge. He married a woman of the Zhao clan, whose nature inclined toward drink.\n\nAt that time, Guo Xueya of Huangxi, a clansman of the master’s elder brother, also studied under Yuanxuan, and both received the transmission of the *Eight Generals*. Xueya’s practice yielded verification, and he issued a talisman declaring: *\"The Daoist methods are further refined across the land, yet the* Purple Court *remains unmatched among rivers and lakes.\"* Upon seeing this, Yuanxuan remarked, *\"Even I have no end to my harmony.\"* From then on, Huang and Han incurred the master’s displeasure.\n\nYet Xueya remained at Yuanxuan’s door day and night, serving with labor and obedience beyond that of a slave, though he had still not received the full transmission. When Yuanxuan’s illness grew critical, he said to Xueya, *\"Among my four or five disciples, none have served me as you have. I shall die soon, yet I regret that my burial clothes, shroud, coffin, and outer casket remain unprepared—what is to be done?\"* Xueya replied, *\"Master, do not trouble yourself over this; your disciple will see to each detail.\"* Yuanxuan, pleased, swore an oath: *\"If you provide me with garments, I shall ensure you wear brocade. If you furnish the planks, I shall return two coffins to you.\"*\n\nHe then instructed, *\"Bring down the chest from my bed frame.\"* One by one, he examined the method texts within and handed them to Xueya, saying, *\"All has been thoroughly entrusted to you. Yet the method for pursuing consumptive ailments still holds the profound mysteries of the Inner Court—all of which are transmitted orally. Now I pass them to you.\"* And so he revealed all his secrets.\n\nAfter Yuanxuan’s death, Xueya clothed him in the prepared garments and buried him in the coffin from his own hall. By this method, Xueya’s name resounded across rivers and lakes. Though some of his disciples received the transmission, only my late father and Shi Yuru did so in full. The two families exchanged letters frequently yet never met, each unaware of what the other had attained.\n\nWhen Xueya transmitted the method to my late father, he said, *\"A hundred taels for the* Purple Court*, fifty taels for the* Flowing Water *method—this is all I teach you. If your son is unteachable, I shall not transmit further. If your grandson proves worthy, you must teach him for me.\"*\n\nOne day, my late father again prepared a token of sincerity and presented it, knowing Xueya had urgent need. Seizing the opportunity, he sought to exhaust all secrets. Xueya smiled and said, *\"The method is already complete; there is no need to ask further. The texts you may copy, but you must answer my urgency as I answer yours—like unending gold, I teach you so your descendants may benefit without end.\"*\n\nFrom my youth, I followed my late father in treating consumptive ailments for twenty years. Practicing this method for over twenty more, I have seen swift and resonant responses, aided by the efficacy of my late father’s spirit and the authority of his assisting generals.\n\nI have often reflected that those afflicted with consumptive illnesses, as the saying goes, *\"hide their ailments.\"* Truly, this is so. Those who contract such diseases fear others knowing or speaking of it—yet how can they not speak? The afflicted are deluded by ghosts, despising any mention of their condition. By the time they awaken and seek treatment, the illness has already deepened.\n\nMoreover, some physicians, though aware of the consumption and their own inability to cure it, conceal the truth to mislead the patient. Even as death approaches, they claim the illness is harmless. Alas, how can such medicine effect a cure?\n\nConsumption arises from five sources: *wine exhaustion, sexual exhaustion, depletion exhaustion, qi exhaustion,* and *transmitted exhaustion.* Their symptoms appear similar, but *transmitted consumption* involves worms and malevolent spirits, bringing calamity that even kin cannot sever.\n\nTransmitted consumption stems from five causes: contracting the illness from the clothing or fabrics of a consumptive household (*clothing transmission*); acquiring it through the utensils of an afflicted family (*utensil transmission*); inhabiting a consumptive’s dwelling (*dwelling transmission*); consuming food or drink sent by a consumptive household, or partaking of their wine and meat (*food transmission*); or mourning the dead and inhaling the *qi* of their corpse (*corpse transmission*). Those who fall ill without cause suffer from *flying corpse* or *wandering consumption*, often due to grudges, curses, or oral hexes.\n\nWhen one first contracts the illness, symptoms include alternating chills and fever, aching joints, vexing heat in the five centers, withered hair, dizziness, coughing with phlegm, vomiting or coughing blood, nausea, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest oppression, abdominal distension or pain, heartburn, bitter taste, dry tongue, sallow complexion, weakness, cravings for meat, or sudden aversion to food, swollen lymph nodes, nightmares of ghostly unions, seminal emissions, turbid urine, pain radiating from the back to the heart, throat sores, throbbing headaches, and disrupted yin-yang balance. Over years, the symptoms grow increasingly strange: worms may move throughout the body, or one may feel biting in the abdomen or back, or sense them intercepting food in the throat, or emerging from the genitals or anus—such bizarre manifestations are limitless.\n\nIn prolonged cases, symptoms worsen: edema, diarrhea, spontaneous sweating, night sweats, emaciated calves, loss of complexion, sore throat, wheezing, chest tightness, crimson lips, flushed face, blood-spotted skin, involuntary seminal emissions in men, uncontrolled vaginal discharge in women, blocked menstruation, throat sores—all dire signs, with ten out of ten cases proving fatal.\n\nFor those seeking treatment, one must first compose a sincere petition, detailing the symptoms and their causes. Relying on this, issue talismans for fumigation and verification, submit memorials to the spirits, pursue the worms, and administer restorative treatment to dispel the symptoms. The afflicted must cultivate themselves with utmost care, avoiding physical exertion. If they fail to observe the precepts—succumbing to cold or heat, excessive joy, anger, sorrow, or anxiety, overindulging in food or drink, neglecting hunger or overeating, or violating abstinence from wine and sex—if they disregard restorative care and moderation, the illness will soon recur, leaving no hope for recovery.\n\nOn the first day of the jiashen year of the Zhizheng era, fifth-generation descendant Zhang Shunlie respectfully inscribed.\n\n**Procedures for Practice**\n\nFor all who come to the altar seeking treatment, first write three *Wash-Hand Talismans*, then seven *Fumigate-Brush Talismans*. Have the patient wash their hands with the *Wash-Hand Talisman* and soap, without drying with cloth to avoid lint, allowing the hands to air-dry. Some claim medicinal ingredients are used in the talismans, but I employ only water for washing. Once the hands are dry, rub them together briskly, then examine them closely.\n\nNext, light incense in a censer and burn one *Fumigate-Brush Talisman*, folding it into the flame. Have the patient hold their hands over the smoke, repeating the process for each talisman. Some may show results after one, others after three or five. If fine hairs appear in the smoke or upon re-fumigation, it confirms *consumptive transmission*; if none appear, the condition is not present. Careful observation is essential—mistaking lint for hairs wastes effort in treatment.\n\nWhen hairs emerge, note their color and location. The five viscera—green, yellow, red, white, and black—each correspond to specific afflictions. The hairs reveal which organ is damaged, their length, thickness, quantity, and whether they stretch, contract, soften, stiffen, or fork. If they appear at the *Heavenly Gate*, *Tiger’s Mouth*, *Ghost’s Door*, palm center, beneath fingers, on the back of the hand, or the upper joints of fingers—left for men, right for women—red or black, long or thick, contracted or extended, numerous, soft, or forked, with strange colors, these are all inauspicious signs. Careful examination reveals the depth of the illness.\n\nIf others have been preemptively sought for treatment and fumigation, and hairs appear, pursue the worms; if none appear, return to this altar for re-fumigation. The absence of hairs may result from improper invocation of the spirit-generals to restrain the worms during the initial talisman use, allowing them to escape into the bodies of the patient’s family or hide within walls. Use the proper method to summon and confine them to the patient’s original site of injury. After one or two days, reapply the talismans for fumigation—hairs will surely appear.\n\nIn cases where the worms have damaged the kidneys, fumigation often yields no hairs, yet pursuit may still reveal worms. This is a known occurrence.\n\nWhen hairs appear during fumigation, record the symptoms and submit a petition to the *Northern Emperor*, the *Northern Dipper*, the *Four Saints*, and the *Zongshi of Mount Hua*. Issue talismans to pursue the worms: first, place one *General Talisman* at the front of the room. Then, use forty-nine talismans, ingesting seven daily while awaiting a response.\n\nWhen the worms descend, signs will manifest akin to the three therapeutic methods of sweating, vomiting, and purging in medicine. Three, seven, or fifteen days after ingesting the talismans, the body may grow hot and sweat—remain still until itching arises, as if insects crawl across the skin. This is the *sweating* response. Wipe the body clean with clothing, then boil and rewear it. Burn the bedding as well.\n\nIf nausea and retching occur, the patient will vomit worms, foul phlegm, or undigested food—examine the contents for worms. This is the *vomiting* response. If the abdomen rumbles or aches, signaling a bowel movement, avoid using the latrine. Collect the excrement in a chamber pot; whether loose or hard, worms will be present. This is the *purging* response. Worms expelled through vomiting or purging are large and visible, while those in sweat are small and hard to see.\n\nThe forms of worms vary: some resemble infants, snakes, rats, loaches, eels, toads, tadpoles, mosquitoes, gnats, ants, lice, or other creatures; others appear as tangled silk, rotting floss, flesh balls, hair, horsehair, palm fiber, grass seeds, hemp, millet, fruit pits, essence-blood, glue, lacquer, rotting dough, or phlegm—countless shapes, impossible to describe fully. Examine them closely and burn them to prevent recurrence. If discarded outdoors, rain and dew may revive them. The worms, pressed by thunder and fire, may die if small, but larger ones survive—this has been observed in expelled worms.\n\nThe original method of pursuing worms relies on the three responses of sweating, vomiting, and purging. After years of practice, variations have emerged. Some patients sweat first from the feet, then the legs, followed by the buttocks, arms, flanks, and head, recovering in stages. Others, after twenty-one days of pursuit, show no response but nosebleeds; upon washing and examining the blood, worms as thick as shoelaces and over six inches long were found. Still others expelled centipedes from their ears, or worms the size of ants crawled from their beards and faces. Such strange phenomena are limitless. Without proper method, worms may flee.\n\nWhen pursuing worms with talismans, proceed gradually—do not invoke the *Seven Ghosts* or impose deadlines for responses. Trust in the spirit-officers’ discretion. If the talismans are ingested too hastily, the worms may thrash and die within the consumed organs, worsening the damage and making restoration difficult. The patient may soon perish. A gradual approach allows thunder and fire to weaken the worms, preventing further feeding until they perish from exhaustion. The talismans in this tradition include restorative treatment, so by the time the worms descend, the damaged areas have already begun healing—delay is thus preferable. Premature expulsion leaves the viscera depleted and *original qi* weakened, making restoration difficult. Delay ensures the viscera remain firm and *original yang* intact, facilitating easy recovery. Other traditions prioritize swift responses, but many fail to recover.\n\nIn households where many have perished from this illness, the worms grow large and gain intelligence, able to move in and out of bodies, hide in walls, circulate *qi*, and spread toxins to infect others.\n\nMoreover, the worms may exit the body of the afflicted and enter the body of one yet uninfected, roaming and feeding before returning to the sick. In critical cases where the five viscera are failing, the corpse-worms emerge one month—or even half a month—before the patient’s death, hence the saying: *\"When the worms depart, the person perishes.\"* Some claim the worms must not be expelled, warning that their removal leads to death—this is a grave error. Others, observing the patient’s critical state, advocate first restoring then expelling, but this too is misguided. If the worms are not pursued and eradicated, they will fester within, consuming the flesh like maggots, spreading corruption—how then could the patient survive? After expelling the corpse-worms, restoration must begin at once, not delayed even a single day. One must obtain a pig’s leg bone. For coughing, add pig’s lung, simmer until tender, then mix in a little rice. Once cooked, cut fifteen strips of the restorative talisman into fine pieces and stir them into the broth, ensuring the paper does not clump. Take this at dawn each day, and after consuming it, do not return to sleep, for this is most harmful. Salt must not be added.\n\nAfter consuming the talisman for four or five days, the abdomen settles, food becomes palatable, daily meals increase, and the symptoms gradually recede—even the critically ill may recover. If, however, the stomach rejects it, the abdomen swells, or diarrhea persists, or if one feels nauseous after eating, even a mild case may turn perilous. Strict dietary restrictions must be observed: pond fish, leavened bread, baked cakes, sesame cakes, beef, lamb, goose, sow pork, rapeseed oil, fried or roasted foods, cured meats, alcohol, raw or cold items, and all toxic substances must be avoided with utmost care. Daily meals should not be excessive, nor should one undertake long journeys, carry heavy loads, or strain the sinews and vessels, lest the injured areas suffer further damage and the illness relapse. Sexual abstinence is imperative, and one must maintain vigilance for a full year, allowing the injured flesh—both old and new—to knit together, so that movement and rest may proceed without hindrance. Even in mild cases, convalescence for half a year is essential to ensure lasting vitality and longevity.\n\n*Upper Scroll of the Purple Palace Mysterious Writ*\n**Principal Rites**\n\nThe Celestial Star Who Subdues the Myriad Demons, the North Pole Purple Tenuity Great Emperor.\nThe Central Heaven Great Sage, the Nine Sovereigns of the Northern Dipper, the Divine Perfected Sovereign of the Great Dao.\nThe Nine Heavens’ Supreme Assistant, the Spiritually Potent and Eminent Deity, the Jade Perfected of Primordial Void and Longevity, the True Lord of the Azure Heaven and the Solar Fiery Heavenly Worthy.\nThe True Lord of the Azure Heaven and the Solar Fiery Heavenly Worthy.\nThe Great Sage of the Celestial Stem, the Purple Court Perfected, the Golden Radiance Heavenly Lord.\n**Lineage of the Dao’s Origin**\nThe Sagely Master, Teacher of Humans and Devas, the Great Perfected of the Threefold Numinous, Threefold Blessings, and Threefold Responses, Protector of the Realm.\nAncestral Master, the Flying Rosy Clouds Perfected Dong.\nLineage-Confirming Ancestral Master, the Golden Florescence Perfected Lu of Nurturing Vitality.\nFirst-Generation Ancestral Master, the Joyously Impoverished Perfected Fang.\nAncestral Master, the Tranquil Hermitage Perfected Yan of Dao-Nature.\nSecond-Generation Ancestral Master, the Carriage Terrace Perfected Yan of Dao-Prosperity.\nThird-Generation Lineage Master, the Snow Cliff Perfected Guo of Responding to Auspices.\nFourth-Generation Lineage Master, the Celestial Vault Perfected Zhang of Primordial Longevity.\nFifth-Generation Scripture Master, the Clear Stream Perfected Zhang of Shun’s Ardency.\n\n**Principal Generals**\nThe Marshal Zhao Guangyuan, Commander of the Primordial Qi of the Supreme August Palace, Catcher and Slayer of Ghosts.\nThree heads, six arms, wielding the marshal’s seal, binding rope, bow, arrows, sword, and fire bell.\nThe Marshal Mao Weiba, Great General Who Imprisons, Interrogates, and Torments Ghosts, Governing the Myriad Demons of the Three Realms.\nThe Marshal Tong Liyang, Great General Who Captures and Restrains Ghosts, Commanding the Myriad Demons.\nThe Marshal Xiong Shisheng, Devourer and Consumer of Ghosts.\nCrowned with a cloud-wreathed cap, clad in golden armor, azure robe with wind-swept sash, black boots, brandishing a great blade.\nThe Marshal Deng Xingwen, Scorcher and Illuminator of Ghosts under the Fiery Emperor’s Wrath.\nThe Marshal Li Shijin, Breaker of Bones, Slayer and Annihilator of Ghosts in the Four Netherworlds.\nThe Marshal Tian Zhen, Commander of the Golden-Armored Flying Hawks.\nThe Marshal Jia Zhen, Commander of the Silver-Armored Hunting Dogs.\n\n**Deputy Generals**\nThe Four-Eyed Elder, Celestial General Li Guozhen.\n\nWith a face the hue of jujube, large eyes, four pupils, wearing a gold-threaded net cap, a crane-feather cloak of azure mist, black boots, and wielding an iron brush—High Northern Elder Gao Bozhen.\n\nCrowned with a snow-curled cap, clad in a black robe, green boots, a wind-swept sash, and brandishing a great blade—Long-Skulled Beast Zhou Zhongda.\n\nTopknot bound toward the heavens, black boots, green robe, wind-swept sash, and holding a white staff—White Owl of the Three Spirits, Liu Biwen.\n\nCurved-topknot, yellow headband, golden armor, azure silk robe, wind-swept sash, black boots, and lifting a three-legged white-backed magpie—Mighty Sword Spirit-King Zheng Xianli.\n\nTopknot bound toward the heavens, golden armor, green robe, red boots, and wielding twin swords—Body-Broad-as-the-Wind Zhang Xi.\n\nCrowned with a snow-curled cap, red robe, wind-swept sash, golden armor, green boots, holding a blade and clenching twin swords in his mouth—Heavenly Courier of Fierce Fury, Liu Yi.\n\nTopknot bound toward the heavens, golden armor, black robe and boots, both hands lifting a green banner emblazoned with four beasts—Scorching Blood Messenger of the Fiery Emperor, Long Xu.\n\nWith a crimson face, three eyes, fangs, vermilion hair, a Heavenly Guardian’s crown, scarlet robes, red shoes, riding a wheel of fire, left hand forming the Purple Tenuity mudra, right hand wielding a flame sword, his entire body wreathed in fire, the blade’s tip blazing fiercely—Heavenly General Gao, Pursuer of Consumptive Spirits and Slayer of Wasting Ghosts.\n\nHeavenly General Li, Collector of Lingering Curses and Seizer of Poisons.\n\nMarshal Xiong, Great General Who Pursues Consumptive Spirits.\n\nGreat General Who Fills Essence and Replenishes Marrow.\n\nThirty-Six Heavenly Generals.\n\nSeventy-Two Talismanic Officers.\n\n**The Master’s Wondrous Application**\nThe Master draws upon the Northern qi to suffuse his body, transforming his spirit, forgetting form and severing thought. Closing his eyes, he inwardly visualizes the radiant light within his heart’s aperture. Then, directing the divine light of his right eye, he inscribes the Nine Characters before him. With both hands, he projects two Dipper stars forth, envisioning their starlight blazing brilliantly. The Master exhales his true qi, which shoots into the Dipper, emanating from the Nine Orifices to manifest the Seven Primordial Star Lords—hair unbound, swords in hand, vividly present upon the altar.\n\nThereafter, he recites the Tianpeng Incantation once, visualizing the true form of Tianpeng: four heads, eight arms, each wielding halberd, spear, halberd-sword, imperial bell, seal, fire lance, and fire rope; clad in a purple robe and golden armor, head adorned with the Xiaoyao Huayang turban, emerging within the Dipper. His countenance is wrathful, his might shakes heaven and earth, his entire body radiates the killing qi of thunder and fire.\n\nThe Master inhales qi to suffuse his body, declaring, “I am the Emperor.”\n\nNext, he recites the Purification of Heaven and Earth Incantation and the Tianpeng Incantation.\n\n**Solemnly Summoning:**\nThe Qi-Unifying Marshal Zhao of the Primordial Responding Great August Prefecture, Commander-in-Chief Who Seizes and Slays Ghosts;\nMarshal Mao, Overseer of the Three Realms Who Imprisons, Interrogates, and Torments Ghosts;\nMarshal Tong, Commander Who Captures and Restrains Ghosts;\nMarshal Xiong, Devourer and Consumer of Ghosts;\nMarshal Li, the Four-Eyed Elder;\nMarshal Gao, the High Northern Elder;\nMarshal Zhou, the Long-Skulled Beast;\nMarshal Liu, the White Owl of the Three Spirits;\nMarshal Zheng, the Mighty Sword Spirit-King;\nMarshal Zhang, Body-Broad-as-the-Wind;\nMarshal Liu, Heavenly Courier of Fierce Fury;\nMarshal Long, Scorching Blood Messenger of the Fiery Emperor;\nMarshal Gao, Commander of the Golden-Armored Flying Hawks;\nMarshal Gao, Commander of the Silver-Armored Hunting Dogs;\nMarshal Gao, Pursuer of Consumptive Spirits;\nMarshal Xiong, Great General Who Pursues Consumptive Spirits;\nMarshal Li, Collector of Lingering Curses and Seizer of Poisons;\nMarshal Qiu, Rear-Guard Great General;\nGreat General Who Fills Essence and Replenishes Marrow;\nThirty-Six Heavenly Generals;\nSeventy-Two Talismanic Officers—\nHasten to the altar, awaiting commands to act. *Swiftly!*\n\nThe Master forms the Living Luminary mudra with his left hand, gazing toward the northwest’s loftiest heights, and draws forth the purple-black golden light of the Supreme Mystery’s qi to spread before him. The Generals emerge from the killing qi. Upon completing the mudra, the true Dipper vanishes, leaving only the Generals manifest within the killing qi, ready for service.\n\n**General Command Talisman**\nThis talisman employs the Tianpeng Incantation to inscribe the killing character, infusing it with killing qi. Above it, the character for \"Commander-in-Chief\" is added, followed by the auxiliary talisman.\n\n**Talisman Formula**\nSolemnly invoke the Qi-Unifying Great General of the Primordial Responding Great August Prefecture, the Primary and Deputy Marshals, and the Six Heavenly Generals Who Pursue Consumptive Spirits.

Furthermore, bid them work ceaselessly day and night to encircle and seize the ancestral kin of consumptive ghosts and vengeful dead, relentlessly executing them until all measures are fully enacted.\n\nOnce inscribed, recite the Tianpeng Incantation forward while brushing the talisman in the same direction; recite it backward while brushing in reverse. Draw the Supreme Mystery’s qi from behind the elbow into the brushstroke, then lift upward and seal with three sets of seven strokes.\n\n**Snow Cliff’s Cloud:**\nThis talisman commands all Generals. Whenever fumigation reveals even the slightest trace, instruct the patient’s household to offer incense and lamps before the afflicted, lest the corpse-worms escape.\n\nWhen inscribing talismans, first recite the Tianpeng Incantation, transforming the spirit into the Emperor. Recite the Tianpeng Incantation again, drawing the qi of thunder and fire. Invoke the Black Emperor of the North, infusing the Supreme Mystery’s qi. Then, channel the thunder-fire qi into the brush, envisioning the flame sword wreathed in blazing fire. The paper represents the patient—with blade and sword, slay the corpse-worms. Thereafter, summon true wrath to embody the killing and punitive force.

envoys—\n*Ram* and *Dhāraṇī*—\nappearing as comely women,\ntheir bodies enveloped in black *qi*,\ndescending beneath the golden bridge.\nThe master inhales the *qi* of the two envoys and blows it in,\nthen draws in three breaths of *qi* into the talisman,\nuntil the teeth grow cold.\nAfter the two alignments, inscribe:\n*Summon the Heavenly Generals to swiftly dispel*\n*the tidal fever from the afflicted body.*\n\nIf the five centers are vexed, swallow with cinnabar-infused cold water, then inhale the smoke of aloeswood incense and swallow facing north.\n\n**Boiling Ghosts**\nWhen boiling ghosts, first summon the Commander to lead the five boiling-ghost generals to the altar. Once the Commander’s name is inscribed, invert the feet upward. Within, write: *Five Thunders, General Summons to Slay Corpse Ghosts, Dragon Dawn*. Follow the Five Fire Talisman to conclude. Fashion a paper twist, and with a single breath, ignite it from the talisman’s foot.\n\nFirst light it beneath the afflicted one’s bed, then add it to the Earth God’s hall, and again to the Household Deities’ shrine. Have someone listen for the report of its crackling. If the scent of burning bone arises, it signals ancestral ghosts, female ghosts drawn by blood, ghosts of childbirth, or those transmitting corpse contagion through roasted flesh. Other malign influences include wine and vinegar vapors, sulfur and orpiment fumes, flames of grievance, ancient essence of lotus fragrance, the stench of Buddhist and Daoist bronze and iron, the reek of blades and beasts, the grassy breath of maternal uncles and aunts, the foulness of various *xiao*-spirits, or the consumptive miasma of neighbors. If these manifest in the patient’s dreams or sleep-talk, someone must listen for the response and proceed as deemed fit.\n\n**Seven Ghosts, Four Illuminations, Shattering the Bones**\nWhen inscribing this talisman, invoke the master to commence pursuit and summon the generals with clear intent. Infuse three breaths of *qi* into brush and ink, then inscribe with focused visualization.\n\nOn the right, use the *Heavenly Peng* incantation to write the talisman. For the Nine Slayings, write the Slaying with *ding* on the left and *jia* on the right. The master visualizes a fireball in the cinnabar field, imagining the brush as a fire sword. With one stroke, the fireball splits open, and the marshal appears. The master seals firmly, drawing the *qi* from the Ninefold Mud Pill into the body. With a single opening of the eyes, thunder and lightning swirl, and fire erupts from the talisman. Envision the stars’ radiance distinctly.\n\nRecite:\n*Reverently invite the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, the Seven Thousand Divine Generals, to descend into the talisman and slay the corpse ghosts. Swiftly compel their manifestation.*\n\nVisualize the Dipper’s Perfected Ones, hair unbound and swords in hand, entering the talisman’s locus. Mobilize the Five Thunders into the intermediate realm, drawing the *qi* of the Central Heaven into the Mysterious Pass. Blow it toward the northwest’s highest point, envisioning the Purple Tenuity Emperor Star vast as a cartwheel, its light illuminating the earth. With both hands, trace the Northern Emperor’s command to slay and compel, and the *Kuigang*’s rousing decree to slay and compel the two Dippers. Shatter the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, and suddenly behold the Northern Emperor above, mounted on a crimson-maned white horse, attended by the Four Saints. Draw in the star *qi*.\n\nRecite:\n*Your servant reverently summons the Northern Culmen’s Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity, whose imperial carriage enters the talisman to personally lead the slaying and subjugation.*\n\nThe master concentrates the spirit, guiding the Emperor into the talisman with the gaze.\n\n**Mysterious Void Incantation**\nReverently invite Marshal Heavenly Peng, Marshal Heavenly You, Marshal Winged Saint, and Marshal Protector Saint to lead their troops into the talisman. Visualize the Four Saints and their armies from the four directions entering the talisman. Then inscribe the Dipper among the Four Saints, with *Breaking Army* pointing *Gen* to shoot the Ghost Gate.\n\nThe Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity commands the Three Origins and the Three Officials’ Great Emperors to lead their troops into the talisman to slay and subjugate the corpse ghosts. Visualize the Three Officials entering.\n\nThe Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity commands the Great Emperor of Fengdu to lead his troops into the talisman to slay. Visualize their entry from the north.\n\nThe Six Cavern Chiefs and Kings, Spirits of Consumption Pursuit, receive the Emperor’s command to lead their troops in slaying. Envision them arriving from the *Gen* direction, wielding wolf-tooth clubs.\n\nThe Three Officials’ Great Emperors decree slaying and compulsion. The Great Emperor of Fengdu decrees slaying and compulsion. The Six Cavern Chiefs and Kings behead and compel. Recite the Northern Incantation, rise, and perform the inner *qi* technique with three breaths. Then, in sequence and reverse, draw *Peng* into left and right to compel and expel anger, applying it with the brush.\n\n**Three Sovereigns’ Sealing Dispatch**\nWhen inscribing this talisman, one must embody great wrath to manifest Heaven’s majesty and enable slaying and subjugation. Never employ it lightly, nor profane the Emperor. For it possesses the power to revive the dead—how could it respond without true sincerity and true wrath?\n\n**Volume Forty-Six of *Pearls from the Ocean of Dharma*: *The Purple Imperial Mysterious Writ***\n\n**Generals of the Ranks**\n\n**Grand General Xiong Gui, Marshal of Pursuit and Consumption**\nThree heads, six arms; crimson face, fierce and majestic; clad in purple robes, golden armor, and green boots; wielding halberd, sword, bow, arrows, spear, and ji.\n\n**Grand General Liu Qi, Marshal of Severing Curses**\nFace of a green ghost, fanged; dressed in purple robes, golden armor, and green boots; brandishing twin great blades.\n\n**Grand General Ji of the Deaf Legions, Zhou**\nBlue face, fanged, with flaming red hair; grasping a ji; neck hung with twin skulls.\n\n**Grand General Wei of the Mute Legions, Li**\nDate-hued face, three strands of beard; one eye phoenix-like, the other apricot-shaped; clad in mirror-bright golden armor; wielding a great blade, barefoot.\n\n**Grand General Ji of the Shattered Brow, Zhao**\nRound crimson face, long beard; head crowned with a mountain; dressed in green robes and black boots.\n\n**Fishermen, Netters, Hunters**\n**Grand General of the Blood Basin, Great Marshal of the Fire Bells**\n\n**The Peerless Sage of Mount Chu**\n\n**Officers of Devouring Demons and Consuming Ghosts**\n**Officers of Slaying Evil, Razing Shrines, Seizing Curses, and Consuming Afflictions**\n\n**Divine Kings of the Constellations, Warriors of Battle and Strife**\n**Officers and Soldiers of Talismanic Execution, Eradicating Ghosts and Traces**\n\n**The Radiant and Wondrous Legions under the Jade Maidens**\n**Envoys of the Five Directions’ Hawks and Hounds**\n**Officials and Generals of the Inner Court’s Conjoined Forces**\n\n**Sequence of Posthumous Ritual Execution**\n\nFor households afflicted by consumption where the sick cannot rise, the talisman is to be inscribed on catalpa wood, six *cun* in length—adding half a *cun* in leap years—one and a half *cun* in width. Present the petition to the master on an *shen* day, then offer sacrifices and provisions to the deceased. The talisman is held by the bereaved—men on the left, women on the right—before burning the petition in each chamber.\n\nUpon completion of the ritual, proceed to the place where the coffin rests. Calm the mind and concentrate the spirit, then trace a well within the coffin, envisioning it as a withered pit. Invoke the marshals to seize and confine the flying corpse, corpse-worms, ghostly entities, curses, and affliction-*qi* into the well.\n\nRecite the seven-turn incantation, strike with the Thunder Formation, and drive them in with the Thunder-Fire Mantra. Then seal the coffin.\n\nThereafter, select an auspicious day to perform the posthumous severance according to the method.\n\nThe Patriarchs have sworn: to employ this method lightly is to invite calamity upon oneself. One must approach the altar with utmost reverence before proceeding. Only through perfect sincerity can resonance be achieved. Strictly adhere to these precepts; do not treat them as mere common text.\n\n**Summoning and Assembly**\n\nThe master draws the *qi* of the Central Heaven, enters the central [aperture] to stir it, and exhales toward the extreme northwest heights. He envisions the Purple Tenuity Emperor Star, vast as a chariot wheel, its light illuminating the earth, and parts his hands. The Northern Emperor issues his command to restrain and seize. The *Kui*-*Gang* roars into motion, enforcing the seizure. The *Zi-Wu* Dipper and the Second Dipper clash open the stellar enclosure; the master perceives the Great Emperor within. He inhales *qi* to suffuse his body, declaring, \"I am the Northern Culmen,\" and summons at once.\n\n\"Fiery Emperor’s scorching blood, the Four Luminaries shatter the corpse; Heavenly Strategist annihilates the kind. With one stroke of the divine blade, ten thousand ghosts scatter in rout.\"\n\nSolemnly he summons the Fiery Emperor’s Scorching Blood Envoys: \"Hasten to the altar at my command.\" The summons complete, the master faces south. He circulates kidney-water upward to strike the heart-fire, and the envoys ascend the twin passes of the spine, traverse the twelve-storied tower, and emerge from the spirit chamber, merging with the southern quadrant into one. They manifest instantly in *Li*. The master unites with primordial *qi*, and with his gaze directs the characters \"one,\" \"three,\" and \"seven\" upon the left-hand Jade Seal—golden light is the Dao.\n\nOnce the Scorching Blood Generals have arrived at the altar, he raises the imperial decree and commands them to proceed directly to the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, summoning Marshal Xiong, the Great General of Consumptive Pursuit; Marshal Liu, the Great General of Affliction-Severing; Marshal Zhou, the Great General of Deafening Troops; Marshal Li, the Great General of the Mute; Marshal Zhao, the Great General of the Furrowed Brow; and all their subordinate officers and generals. \"Hasten to the altar at my command.\"\n\nThe summons complete, the master wields his sword-finger to sever, bestowing upon the great marshals the breath of command. They ascend directly to the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. The master grasps the Purple Tenuity Enclosure Seal and recites the Black Emperor’s incantation of the North:\n\n\"Northern Black Emperor, supreme among the myriad sages.\nGreat Tenuity’s Six *Jia*, the Five *Qi* Spirit Lords.\nRadiance surpassing sun and moon, might encompassing heaven and earth.\nFlying talismans seize the registers, severing the gates of ghosts.\nMarching spirits deploy *qi*, dispelling the Five Pestilences.\nLeft and right officers and soldiers, the Three and Five Generals.\nThunder Lords and thunderbolts, lightning flashing through racing clouds.\nBlades like rain, ranks like clouds.\nHolding the imperial chime, crowned with Kunlun.\nPatrolling the world, hunting demonic essences.\nThe Earth Gods of the Nine Provinces, the blood-feeding guests—\nnone dare resist.\nShould any dare to spread their scales,\nthe Star of Stability binds their hands,\nthe Northern Emperor seizes their souls,\nthe Three Terraces and Seven Stars wield swords to sever their bodies.\nCrimes shall not be lightly punished; calamity shall befall yourselves.\nDemonic essences and *wangliang*—let not your ears hear.\nWhoever hears my incantation shall have their heads shattered, brains split,\nscattered like fine dust.\"\n\nSolemnly he summons Marshal Xiong, the Great General of Consumptive Pursuit; Marshal Liu, the Great General of Affliction-Severing; Marshal Zhou, the Great General of Deafening Troops; Marshal Li, the Great General of the Mute; Marshal Zhao, the Great General of the Furrowed Brow; and all officers and generals of the Heavenly Pen Inner Court. \"Hasten to the altar at my command.\" The master extends the Purple Tenuity Seal with his left hand, raises the golden light, and guides the gaze of the generals, clearly manifesting them within the altar from the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, ready to be dispatched at will.\n\nThis posthumous-severing jade talisman is inscribed while reciting the Heavenly Pen Mantra. Upon completion, it is infused into the *Du-Tong* over the corpse-killing ghost. Before the third seven-day period, the principal and secondary talismans are applied to the demonic essence. Using the Northern Black Mantra, the names of the five generals are inscribed upon the *Du-Tong*, infused with primordial *qi* and sealed with three seven-fold presses. As commonly employed, this ensures total subjugation, swiftly extinguishing corpse-demons and demonic essences.\n\nNext, he mobilizes thunder:\n\"Reverently I invoke the Heavenly Thunder, the Heavenly Emperor Shi;\nthe *Qian* Earth Thunder shakes the earth to the heavens.\n*Kun*’s left harbors the Poisonous Thunder, ever shining;\nits right holds the Poisonous Thunder, flashing with lightning.\nSpring thunder constantly strikes flying sky-demons;\nsummer thunder strikes earthly evil to annihilation.\nAutumn thunder flashes, racing through the clouds;\nwinter thunder strikes ten thousand evils to extinction.\nThe halting thunder, the great tree without shelter—\nmay it ever protect the myriad people and descend auspiciousness.\n*Om du-liu, da du-liu, fei du-liu*, restrain and seize!\"\n\nWith the left formation, he turns once beneath the left flank—heaven and earth quake.\nThe second turn darkens sun and moon.\nThe third turn at *Xun* stirs the *Kui*-*Gang*.\nThe fourth turn at *Li* ignites thunder-fire.\nThe fifth turn at the center shakes with thunderbolts.\nThe sixth turn at *Kun* crushes the malevolent.\nThe seventh turn at *Gen* captures and seizes those who defy heaven and lack the Dao—\nconsumptive transmission, hidden contagion, all demonic essences.\nSwiftly they submit beneath my Five Thunder *Kui*-*Gang*,\nbound to die, motionless and inert.\n\nWith the right formation, he visualizes beneath the waist: the two hands as the Direct Thunder Envoys, the two kidneys as the Thunder-Climbing Prefecture, the lower abdomen as the Penglai Capital Water Bureau, the heart as the Thunderclap Capital Bureau, the twenty-four vertebrae as the Halting Thunder Great Tree. He stabilizes the two formations, rising from the lower abdomen to the heart, then back to the abdomen, channeling directly from the flanks to the ears as the Thunder Cavern. With one strike, the talisman is infused, envisioning heaven and earth overturned, drawing *qi* into the center through the dual formations.\n\nNext, he recites the Five Fire Mantra:\n\"Heavenly Fire, Earthly Fire,\nYang Fire, Yin Fire,\nthe true fire of my heart,\nthe true fire of the Great Yang,\nthe Five Thunders of the Four Seasons,\nthe roaming true fire.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\"\n\nThe incantation complete, the master hooks his little fingers together, pulling from *Yin* to *Wu* to ignite. He envisions raging flames scorching heaven and earth, annihilating demonic essences. Those who witness it are driven ten thousand fathoms into the earth. With three stomps of the left foot, he envisions the gods and demons seized beneath ten thousand hounds.\n\nSolemnly he summons the Great General of the Primordial Unity, Commander of the Supreme August Prefecture, along with Marshal Xiong, the Great General of Consumptive Pursuit; Marshal Liu, the Great General of Affliction-Severing; Marshal Zhou, the Great General of Deafening Troops; Marshal Li, the Great General of the Mute; Marshal Zhao, the Great General of the Furrowed Brow; and all their subordinate officers and generals. \"Follow the talisman’s command, station yourselves here, and single-mindedly exterminate consumptive transmission, flying corpses, corpse-worms, ghostly entities, and seize affliction-toxins and affliction-*qi*. Protect the household and kin, severing the source of calamity forever.\"\n\n\"Great Marshals, lead your troops into the talisman and station yourselves here.\"\n\nNext, he invokes the Heavenly August Thunder Sovereign:\n\"Heavenly August’s decree commands—\nall generals hasten to attend.\nWho dares disobey shall have their heads struck off, their roots destroyed.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\"\n\nCalming his spirit, he envisions the Heavenly August Emperor manifesting in the Southern Palace. His tongue presses against his upper palate as he inscribes the talisman, his brush and gaze uniting as one. His gaze welcomes the Great Emperor into the talisman.\n\nNext, he inscribes the character *ni* (聻), sealing off all subsequent generals by sweeping his brush from the right forehead across to the left. The upper stroke severs flying corpses; the middle, human transmission; the lower, wandering consumptive *qi*—his left foot crossing over *gen* to halt it.\n\nThen he recites the Golden Light Mantra once, envisioning all generals enveloped within its radiance. Golden *qi* spreads above, resplendent with golden light.\n\nNext, he visualizes the heavens darkening and the earth blackening, holding his breath to observe the karmic retribution. Transforming his spirit into the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, he draws the Great Heavenly Northern *qi* to suffuse his body, then inscribes the □ character within.\n\nFollowing this, he intones the *Xu Xuanyu* Mantra, summoning Tianpeng, Tianyu, Yisheng, and Yousheng to lead their troops into the talisman, eroding and consuming it. He then envisions the Four Saints arriving from the four directions to enter the talisman.\n\nNext, he recites the Tianpeng Mantra, solemnly invoking:\nThe Primordial Responding Great August Prefecture’s Tianpeng Supreme Emperor, with three hundred thousand troops, entering the talisman from the east.\n\nThen the Tianyu Mantra, solemnly invoking:\nThe Primordial Radiance Cinnabar Heavenly Prefecture’s Tianyu Supreme Emperor, with three hundred thousand troops, entering the talisman from the south.\n\nThen the Yisheng Mantra, solemnly invoking:\nThe Primordial Illumination Purple Void Prefecture’s Yisheng Perfected Lord, with three hundred thousand troops, entering the talisman from the west.\n\nThen the Yousheng Mantra, solemnly invoking:\nThe Primordial Harmony Relocation Prefecture’s Yousheng Perfected Lord, with three hundred thousand troops, entering the talisman from the north.\n\nNext, he envisions all generals within the talisman, enveloped in the *qi* of slaughter. After serving the Thunder Rites, no fire is used—only the inscription of the Heavenly August Emperor’s seal and the Golden Light Mantra. He visualizes the generals within, then inscribes the Four Saints’ summons to enter, drawing upon the Great Heavenly Slaughter *qi* for efficacy, and seals it with □.\n\nFor nocturnal operations, the sequence is as follows:\nInitiate the sacred rites, summon the generals, offer sacrifices to dispatch them, conduct thorough searches, perform the *xinggai* ritual, assemble and ascend the altar, send off the deceased, and conclude.\n\nUpon ascending the altar, prepare black water and seal the five cosmic locks of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe master concentrates his spirit in silent prayer:\n\"Rosy light illumines golden hues,\nI gaze in reverence at the master’s majestic form.\nSlaughter-*qi* congeals like frost,\nFrom afar, I behold the marshal’s solemn might.\"\n\nThe disciple of the lineage, [Name], prostrates and offers incense, respectfully invoking:\nThe Heavenly Teaching Master, Lord of Humanity and Devas, the Manifestly Efficacious and Divinely Responsive Protector of the Realm Perfected Lord;\nThe Wondrous Dao Teaching Master, the Right-Assisting and Wondrously Efficacious, Thoroughly Responsive Great Void Perfected Lord;\nThe Sincere Teaching Master, the Manifestly Assisting and Karmically Responsive, Wondrously Distant Perfected Lord.\n\n\"With utmost reverence, I beseech the sagely master to witness and illuminate. Today, on behalf of [Name], I establish the Supreme Black Prison of Grievances. I humbly implore the sagely master to preside over the altar, uphold the teachings, empower the talismans, and guide the household’s unrepentant, unenlightened karmic ghosts and vengeful spirits into the Golden Towers and Jade Chambers, that they may be bound and eradicated. I earnestly pray for the sagely master’s manifest response.\"\n\nSummoning the Generals:\nThe master draws the Golden Light *qi*, exhaling it into the prison, envisioning it as the Golden Towers and Jade Chambers, adorned with rare treasures, exotic flowers, and sumptuous delicacies, all arrayed in perfect clarity. The sagely master stands at the forefront to receive them, then summons Zhe’e:\n\n\"By the decree of the Northern Bureau,\nWind and fire shall not cease.\nZhe’e Great General,\nSwiftly reveal your true form!\"\n\nIssuing the command, he summons the great generals to descend from the northwest, guard the prison, and await further summons.\n\n\"The Heavenly August Emperor’s decree descends,\nThe Northern Emperor takes command.\nAbove, summon the Thunder Department;\nBelow, summon the mountain, marsh, and local deities of the sacrificial register.\nHasten to obey the imperial edict,\nArray the troops in formation.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\"\n\nIn silence, he envisions the thunder deities and sacrificial register spirits stationed on all sides for protection. He instructs trusted attendants to maintain vigilant guard, ensuring no movement.\n\nThen, entering each chamber, he presents the catalpa-wood talismans, proclaims the official documents, and burns them. Executing the Fire Wheel Mudra, he envisions a raging inferno scorching the heavens and slaughtering the earth. Stamping his foot thrice, he sees the malevolent consumptive ghosts and *zha* spirits seized and cast ten thousand fathoms into the earth.\n\nNext, he employs the Heavenly Thunder and Heavenly Emperor’s Release, arranging the formation to mobilize thunder, overturning Heaven and Earth to gather *qi*.\n\nThen he recites:\n\"The Dao of Heaven severs,\nThe Dao of Earth at *hai* severs.\nThe human Dao at *xun* flourishes,\nThe ghost Dao at *kun* severs.\n*Gen* severs all transmission of consumptive ghosts forever,\nA thousand years shall they not meet,\nTen thousand ages shall they not encounter.\nMy talisman severs once,\nAll ghosts are eternally eradicated at the root.\"\n\nAgain, he mobilizes thunder, overturning Heaven and Earth. Holding his breath, he seals the Nine Orifices with his left hand covering his face like Mount Tai, his right sleeve concealing them, preventing any *qi* from escaping. The Yellow River flows backward as he observes the *qi*’s karmic response.\n\nNext, he solemnly invokes:\nThe Primordial Responding Great August Prefecture’s Unified *Qi* Commander-in-Chief;\nThe Consumptive-Pursuing Great General, Marshal Xiong;\nThe Consumptive-Severing Great General, Marshal Liu;\nThe Deafening Troops Great General, Marshal Zhou;\nThe Mute General, Marshal Li;\nThe Zhe’e Great General, Marshal Zhao;\nAnd all attending officials and generals.\n\n\"Today, lead your troops into the talisman and station yourselves here, dedicated to exterminating consumptive transmission, flying corpses, corpse-worms, ghostly entities, and seizing affliction-toxins and affliction-*qi*. Protect the household and kin, severing the source of calamity forever. Rely upon your divine might to enforce these prohibitions.\"\n\nThe master proceeds through each chamber, performing the rites accordingly. He envisions each chamber’s light penetrating the altar, the entire space engulfed in thunder and fire, driving the corpse-ghosts to flee into the Jade Chambers.\n\nAs the master performs the rites, he exhales three mouthfuls of slaughter-*qi* onto the altar, envisioning the *qi* of Heaven and Earth coalescing in slaughter. The altar transforms into the Northern Culmen Demon-Subduing Heavenly Palace, the Jade Chambers into the Northern Prison. The master becomes the Great Emperor, exhaling the mudra to dispatch the generals and seize the spirits.\n\nEmploying the Urgent Net-Forming Mudra, he traces from *gen* into the prison, beseeching the heavenly generals to apprehend the ghosts and imprison them. Casting the divination blocks to deploy the net, he seizes them one by one. If any remain unseized, he secretly dispatches the Consumptive-Severing Great General to pursue them.\n\nNow, he proclaims aloud:\n\"By imperial decree, the supervisory marsh officials are jointly commanded to ensure the capture of the household of [Name], who have defied Heaven and Earth, disobeyed the imperial decree, and harbored the vengeful ghosts of consumptive ancestors and karmic spirits. Seize them and imprison them, that their transgressions may be manifestly revealed and requited.\"\n\nUpon completing the incantation and obtaining the divination blocks, he employs the Dipper Ladle and *guan* ritual implements, concluding with the slaughter-sealing and decapitation-sealing rites.\n\nThe altar’s light vanishes. With the **Arcuate Seven-Circuit Incantation**, he binds them with rope, pressing them down with the **Tai Mountain Seal** in his left hand, then commands: *\"See the **Yá’é** Ridge fly, sealing the prison!\"*\n\nHe solemnly invokes the **Elemental Sovereign of the Original Response**, the **Grand Marshal of the One-Qi Commandery**, **Bear the Great General** leading the **Pursuing Consumption Army**, and **Liu the Great General** leading the **Severing Consumption Army**, along with all subordinate officers and generals, to swiftly seize the household of [Name], whose **consumptive, vengeful, and karmic ghosts** now wreak havoc. They are to be **conveyed to the Supreme Black Prison of Judgment**, where they shall be **forever confined**.\n\nNow, O Great Marshal, **hasten and arrest them immediately!**\n\nAfter the incantation, he commands: *\"The Patriarch oversees the altar. Officials and soldiers encircle, then draw the **Five-Seal Well of Heaven and Earth**.\"*\n\n**Ziwen**, the **Northern Qi**, and the **Black Waters** enter within. The **Scattered Incantation** is chanted universally—all generals, heed the order!\n\nAgain, the **Fire Incantation** is chanted universally, envisioning **flaming fires raging through heaven and earth**. The **Reverse Scattered Incantation** follows, imagining **swords and spears clashing above and below**. He commands the celestial generals to **subdue and imprison the malevolent forces within the Supreme Black Prison**, where they shall **perish and be annihilated**.\n\nAfter descending the altar, he raises the **Sword Seal** with both hands, holding up the **talisman-decree**, envisioning the Patriarch in the sky, dispatching generals to **guard the Ghostly Gate**.\n\nHe solemnly invokes the **Elemental Sovereign of the Original Response**, commanding the **One-Qi Commandery’s Grand Marshal** and the **Hundred Million Subordinate Officers, Generals, Soldiers, and Officials** to descend. Wherever this talisman is cast, they shall encircle it **threefold**, **solemnly seizing and binding** the **flying transmission corpses**, **wandering cadaverous insects**, **vengeful ghosts**, **consumptive qi**, **karmic spirits**, and **malevolent spectral forces**, delivering them beneath the talisman’s decree to **perish and be annihilated**.\n\nNext, he affixes a talisman to the left ankle, just outside the external malleolus, then leads them into the **Well Altar**, sealing it with earth. He declares:\n\n*\"The Heavenly Way is sealed. The Earthly Way is sealed. The Human Way is open. The Ghostly Way is sealed.\"*\n\nThen he strikes the axe, proclaiming:\n\n*\"The Heavenly Way is severed. The Earthly Way is severed. The Human Way is open. The Ghostly Way is severed. All flying transmission corpses, wandering cadaverous insects, and consumptive ghosts are **forever severed**.*\n\n*For ten thousand years, they shall not meet. For a hundred thousand years, they shall not encounter.*\n\n*This talisman now severs—all ghosts are **rootedly exterminated**.*\n\n*Heaven’s annihilation seizes. Earth’s annihilation seizes. Annihilation seizes, seizing annihilation. Seizing annihilation, annihilation seizes. Heaven and Earth’s annihilation seizes, seizing annihilation of heaven and earth. Heaven’s collapse and Earth’s ruin seize annihilation, seizing ruin and collapse of heaven and earth.\"*\n\nThe Master takes **three steps in the Ding-Gang formation**, applying the **Great Heavenly Killing Energy** to his body, declaring, *\"I am the Emperor.\"*\n\nFacing east, he chants the **Mystic Void Incantation**, solemnly invoking **Heaven-Encounter the Grand Marshal**, commanding him to **hasten to my presence** for orders.\n\nWhen the Marshal arrives, he turns south, chanting the **Mystic Void Incantation**, solemnly invoking **Heaven-You the Grand Marshal**, commanding him to **hasten to my presence** for orders.\n\nWhen the Marshal arrives, he turns west, solemnly invoking **Yìshèng the True Lord**, commanding him to **hasten to my presence** for orders.\n\nWhen the Lord arrives, he turns north, solemnly invoking **Yòushèng the True Lord**, commanding him to **hasten to my presence** for orders.\n\nFacing east again, he recites the **Heaven-Peng Incantation**, solemnly summoning **thirty thousand soldiers of the Original Response Imperial Palace**, commanding them to **hasten to my presence**.\n\nNext, he recites the **Heaven-You Incantation**, solemnly summoning **thirty thousand soldiers of the Yuan-Jǐng Dan-Tian Palace**, commanding them to **hasten to my presence**.\n\nNext, he recites the **Northern Incantation**, solemnly summoning **thirty thousand soldiers of the Yuan-Zhào Purple Void Palace**, commanding them to **hasten to my presence**.\n\nFinally, he recites the **Yòushèng Incantation**, solemnly summoning **thirty thousand soldiers of the Yuan-Hé Relocation Academy**, commanding them to **hasten to my presence**.\n\nAs he reaches the **collapsing peaks**, he envisions **heaven and earth trembling**, soldiers gathering like clouds, **ten thousand armies massing**, filling half the realm. He draws the **highest qi from the northwest**, aligning his gaze with the **Lù character**, wielding the **Sword Seal** to **carve and execute**, commanding the generals and officials to **slaughter the city and sever the land**. The Master then **triggers the mechanism**, flips the **Zhuzi**, and falls backward, striking the axe **three times**, chanting:\n\n*\"Consumption severed, ghosts annihilated. Deep grudges dissolved in darkness.*\n\n*With one glance, heaven collapses and earth splits.\"*\n\nThe incantation ends—**heaven overturns, earth inverts**. There is **neither thing nor self, neither ghost nor god**. All is **chaotic and formless**, **void and still**. At the moment the chant begins, **heaven and earth divide anew**, the **Two Principles separate**, and only the **Three True Saints** shine above in **golden radiance**, illuminating the **eight extremes**.\n\nResiding within the **great crimson golden light**, he rises, **sacrifices to the Thunder**, and **thanks the Patriarch** before departing.\n\n**The Mixed Master** first **calms his mind and concentrates**, inscribing the **three golden Shàngluó characters** on his chest with his gaze. He recites the **Proclamation in three reverences**, and though the golden characters vanish, he sees **three Immortals**.\n\nHe recites the **Proclamation of the Three Immortals**:\n\n*\"The High Holy Void Emperor of the Jade Purity,\nThe Supreme True Mixed-Origin Immortal Master,\nManifesting the Original Soul, embodying the Dao,\nHis virtues and practices perfected.\nHe drives thunder and

      "translated_text": "**Precious Gems from the Dharma Ocean**\n\n*Scripture Title:* Precious Gems from the Dharma Ocean. Author unknown. Likely compiled between the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties. Forty-six scrolls in total. Base text sourced from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Peace Section.\n\n---\n\n**Precious Gems from the Dharma Ocean, Scroll 1, Part 1**\n**The Divine Empyrean Scripture of the Ten Celestial Characters**\n\n### **Arcane Refinement in Hidden Practice**\nFor those who wish to receive and uphold the *Scripture of the Ten Celestial Characters* and engage in the work of arcane refinement, perform the following at the four cardinal hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*: face the *xun* direction, sit cross-legged, knock the teeth to gather the spirit, and recite the sacred title nine times. Envision the Divine Empyrean drawing in a breath of azure *qi*, press the tongue against the upper palate, and inscribe the scripture. Hold the jade-green essence within the mouth, swallow it into the heart, and circulate it without dissipation. After a long while, it will surge upward, piercing the *Niwan* (Mud Pill Palace), and emerge as a sphere of *qi*. Continuously recite the sacred title until suddenly, with a thunderous crack, a spark of fire bursts forth from the sphere, merging with the radiance of the azure *qi*. At that moment, perform the rites of reverence and invocation. The spark of fire will instantly transform into celestial fire and azure light, descending straight from the *Niwan* through the *Chonglou* (Double Storied Tower) to the *Dantian* (Cinnabar Field), where it takes seat within the *Danyuan* (Elixir Origin). The deities of the Three Passes and Eight Scenic Realms will all come to pay homage, chanting the celestial scripture in unison. In an instant, all sounds vanish into silence. Practicing this morning and evening for nine years will dissolve the corpse’s toxins, refine both form and spirit to perfection, and unite one with the True Dao.\n\n### **Secret Applications of Inscribing the Scripture**\nFor the talismanic script of the *Celestial Scripture*, burn incense, sit in stillness, and recite the *Scripture of the Ten Celestial Characters* without counting the repetitions. Inscribe these ten characters as a talisman, either in sequence or layered. Upon completion, summon *Zhang Shu*, the Swift Commanding Numinous Flying Divine Talisman Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Primordial Realm. Envision the talisman envoy as a Heavenly Soldier (*Tianding*) wearing a crown, with a blue-green face, golden armor, black robes, green boots, and a wind-swept sash, wielding a jade axe. He descends from the *xun* gate, merging with the ancestral *qi*. Silently pray with utmost sincerity for your intended purpose—whether for supplication, exorcism, ingestion, display, wearing, or consecration. Employ it as you wish, and it will respond without fail.\n\n### **The Scripture of the Ten Celestial Characters**\n*Summoning the Talisman Envoy Talisman*",

Visualize the Primordial Beginning expounding the Thunder Chapter within the Golden Portal, each character radiant with golden light. Then, envision each character filling the vastness of the Great Void, all transforming into golden script, shimmering with luminous brilliance. Next, recite the Thunder Chapter, and Marshal Xin will instantly manifest.\n\n**Uniting Qi and Refining Spirit**\nCompose the spirit and sit in stillness, where heaven and earth dissolve into emptiness. Press the tongue against the upper palate, wait until the Flower Pool’s waters fill, then swallow them into the heart—do this three times. Next, visualize within the black clouds of the northwest a deity resembling a Persian. Draw in *qi* through the nose into the heart, from the heart descend to the kidneys, then from the kidneys return to the heart—repeat this three times, and it is sufficient. Envision this *qi* entering the Cinnabar Field, which is the center of the navel. When fully coalesced into form, it becomes distinctly manifest within one’s Cinnabar Field. Then exhale with a *he* breath, releasing it from the altar to employ as desired. For regular seated refinement, settle into stillness for a time, where self and objects are forgotten, and *qi* circulates within the compass of the One.\n\n**Oath Chapter**\nHeaven unites with my true self, Earth unites with my true self,\nSun and Moon unite with my true self, the Twenty-Eight Constellations unite with my true self.\nMy spirit enters the master’s spirit, the master’s spirit enters my spirit.\nCirculating throughout the Three Realms, I act on the master’s behalf to deliver the myriad spirits.\nUpon completion of the merit, I ascend to the Jade Register, awaiting the master’s return to the Purple Court.\n*As the Primordial Decree commands.*\n\nOnce the incantation is complete, make any prayer as desired. After the prayer, bow once to Lord Xin, merging into one body. Sit upright in perfect stillness, where my body is Lord Xin, and Lord Xin is my body—thus summoning the Thunder Spirits. For refinement practices, enter the Central Palace. Both internal and external practices require eighty-one days each. Cultivate and nourish for three cycles of nine, and thereafter, great responses will be attained in all undertakings.\n\n**Nine Yangs Internal Refinement Thunder Chapter**\nSweep away all worldly concerns, sit in stillness for a long while, then gather and concentrate the Five Agents. When the Five Agents harmonize, spirit, essence, *hun*, and *po* all converge in the Central Palace. Golden light blazes forth, and within it stands Lord Xin. Still the heart and spirit further, descending into the Yellow Chamber, where Lord Liu appears. Next, silently recite the four characters *Nine Woods, Surplus Jade* nine times. Circulate them upward to the Mud Pill Palace, where the practitioner stands between heaven and earth. Then recite the Oath Thunder Chapter:\n\nBefore heaven and earth divided, before yin and yang were distinguished,\nI existed in this moment, without head or face.\nSince I have become myself, the Five Agents are all complete.\nYou, at this moment, are my spirit.\nI am united with you, and you are born from me.\nI now command you: be like me, be like me.\n\nThen silently recite the following incantation: *Cǔn Dì Bù Lín*, eighty-one times, ascending together with me to pay homage in the Jade Clarity. You are the essence of heaven, I am the spirit of earth. Take your essence to assist my spirit. I strike the celestial drum, sounding the Dharma drum thirty-six times, causing the seas and rivers to overturn. From now on, you and I shall be as brothers forever. I dispatch you to heaven to present memorials to the Imperial Lord. I dispatch you to earth to reach the deepest springs. I dispatch you into water to pervade the dark and frigid depths. I dispatch you to relieve great droughts, where true *qi* commands thunder and lightning. I dispatch you to capture specters and demons, binding them to reveal their forms. Universally deliver the world’s suffering, and together we shall establish merit. On the day when merit is complete and the Way fulfilled, I shall ascend with you in flight.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Three Qi Heavenly Lords, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Highest Lord of the Mysterious Heavens decree and command.*\n\nNext, sit in stillness and visualize a mass of golden light containing seed-characters, eternally guarding the Yellow Court. In all twelve hours, whether moving, staying, sitting, or lying down, silently maintain this protection. Even amidst worldly affairs and duties, one must remain vigilant. When engaging in practice, bow to the Great Void, and the spirit will follow the intent to emerge.\n\n*End of the First Scroll of* **Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls**\n\n---\n*(Note: The concluding bibliographic and contextual notes were not translated, as they fall outside the primary text and the requested output format.)*",

      "translated_text": "Behold the master standing within the mouth of the Southern Dipper, clad in black robes, hair unbound, barefoot, grasping a sword. Within the Dipper’s mouth, he stands resolute beneath the sword’s point. Observe the radiant hair-like light above the crown’s gate, where the Mother of Myriad Spirits resides, barefoot, her eyes glancing downward at two intersecting beams of fire. To the left, Marshals Deng and Liu; to the right, Marshals Zhang, Ning, and Ren.\n\nWith a single movement of divine radiance, ten thousand billion thunder spirits array themselves in orderly ranks, each distinct and clear. Visualize your Primordial Destiny True Person approaching the master’s heart and bowing three times to present your petition. The disciple prays:\n\n*\"By long-standing affinity, I have been fortunate to inherit this teaching. Humbly, I beseech your compassion, Master, to grant my request. May you bestow your decree, commanding the Three Great Marshals—Liu, Ning, and Ren—to aid and uphold my practice. I, so-and-so, dare not offend your solemn authority; my heart is filled with boundless gratitude, awaiting your command.\"*\n\nIf praying for rain or petitioning for some matter, visualize the master granting your plea.\n\nConclude with the heart’s incantation:\n\n*\"Heaven unites with my truth,\nEarth unites with my truth,\nSun and moon unite with my truth.\nThe Three Terraces crown my head,\nThe Twenty-Eight Constellations unite with my truth.\nMy spirit enters the master’s spirit,\nThe master’s spirit enters my spirit.\nI traverse the Three Realms,\nActing on the master’s behalf to save the myriad spirits.\nWhen the work is done, I ascend the Jade Register,\nAttending the master to return to the Purple Court.\nHūng śrī tī tā ā chāo mó suō shā.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, or when the heart’s petition is complete, restore your spirit.\n\nIf summoning the thunder spirits, proceed here with the recitation:\n\n**Thunder Rites Chapter**\nChaos without form, the One *qi* gives birth.\nHeaven and earth unfold, thunder and lightning move.\nTā yō Great Brahmā, hūng jì lǜ hēng.\nYin and yang intersect, sun and moon hasten in reverence.\nJū nú shí nà, zhì hè jū zhēn.\nBreathing forth hūng chà, jī bō xiáng jīng.\nEncompassing harmony, wind and fire surge hūng.\nZhōng yìng shù lǎng, wú liàng lǎng hūng.\nAbove harmonizes with below, mountains, seas, and rivers are at peace.\nTrue crow is solemn, true decree commands homage.\nRecite once, and thunder and lightning descend.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Edict of the Lord of Thunder from the Cavernous Mystery commands!*\n\nThe above is the method for gathering and stationing clouds, the secret for summoning thunder and rain.\n\n**Further Internal Refinement**\nRefine this for eighty-one days, nine cycles of nine. When the work is pure and ripe, the response will be as swift as an echo.\n\nSit upright and composed, settle the mind and concentrate the spirit. After a long while, regulate the breath—eighty-one cycles. One inhalation and one exhalation count as one breath. Gaze downward at the spirit palace, where yang *qi* gradually flourishes. Keep intent fixed on the spirit palace. When eighty-one breaths are complete, Marshal Liu’s true form will be fully realized.\n\nSilently recite and visualize the three syllables *Jiū pán chà* nine times. Envision nine beams of cinnabar light from these syllables converging in the spirit palace to form Marshal Liu’s true form, who then pays homage to the Imperial Master.\n\nVisualize the Yellow Court transformed into the Jade Capital of the Divine Empyrean, where the Jade Pivot Emperor sits cross-legged, grasping a sword, encircled by swirling azure light, with thunder spirits arrayed to his left and right.\n\nGaze again at the spirit palace. Silently recite the *Chaos Without Form* thunder chapter and the oath chapter. Then, with the two-character summoning incantation □□, recite it in the heart’s voice, look upward toward the *Li* direction, assume a wrathful expression, and open the eyes wide in anger. See the Marshal emerge from the left eye upon a cloud of fire, standing between heaven and earth before you. If summoning rain in clear weather, have him ride a black cloud emerging from the right eye.\n\nVisualize the Heavenly Lord soaring through the empyrean, stirring wind and clouds, as thunder and rain erupt in full force. At this point, clearly summon the Heavenly Lord to the altar, state your intent, and dispatch him.\n\nThen, gaze downward at the Yellow Court and silently recite the *Strategy for Commanding Thunder* chapter—*Chaos Without Form*—once. Each character appears in golden hue.\n\nAgain, glare fiercely, eyes wide, and shoot forth two beams of golden light from both eyes. Envision the Marshal riding the golden light away, wielding wind and fire, commanding the *qi* of the *Gang* wind to rise. At *Hai*, fire ignites; at *Mao*, thunder roars, and the decree is executed.\n\nFor major matters, recite the two-character incantation □□ eighty-one times; for lesser matters, thirty-six, fifteen, or nine times. Then, draw a long breath through the nose, glare fiercely, and let the spirit follow intent outward. Ascend into the empyrean, where the Heavenly Lord’s true form is distinct.\n\nThe preceding method of regular visualization and refinement is called *refining the spirit*. Directing the spirit upward from the Central Palace to the two eyes, so that the spirit follows the gaze outward, is called *exiting the spirit*. When dispatching for practical use, the spirit’s light from the eyes shoots forth, aiding the Heavenly Generals in conveying authority—this is called *dispatching the spirit*. When Marshal Liu is seen, draw him in through the nose, returning from the Muddy Pellet Palace to the original palace—this is called *returning the spirit*. One downward and one upward movement constitute the wondrous function of exit and entry.\n\nThe master says: *\"When the spirit is settled and *qi* ascends, light emerges and the spirit manifests.\"*\n\nRecite the incantation:\n\n**Returning the Spirit Incantation**\n*\"Spirit returns to the spirit palace,\n*Qi* returns to the cinnabar origin.\nWhen summoned again, return as before,\nAll as in the original rite.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, visualize Marshal Liu, the Heavenly Lord, treading a wheel of fire, wielding a golden whip, descending from the Muddy Pellet Palace.

Inscribe within a circle and silently circulate the divine mechanism—efficacy lies in utmost sincerity.\n\n**The Jade Emperor’s Personal Thunder Mechanism:**\nFace the appropriate direction, set up an incense table, and the summoned deities will arrive instantly.\n\n**Directions for Stepping the Dipper and Flying the Incantation:**\n1. *Wù* (5th Earthly Branch)\n2. *Sì* (6th)\n3. *Wǔ* (7th)\n4. *Wèi* (8th)\n5. *Yín* (3rd)\n6. *Mǎo* (4th)\n7. *Chén* (5th)\n8. *Hài* (12th)\n9. *Zǐ* (1st)\n10. *Chǒu* (2nd)\n11. *Shēn* (9th)\n12. *Yǒu* (10th)\n\nFace the designated direction, draw the Dipper’s *qi*, and blow toward it.

      "translated_text": "**Methods for Summoning Thunder and Transforming Creation**\n\nEstablish the Five Phases’ mutual conquest as the signal. The head aligns with the *Kan* palace, while the inception arises from the gallbladder palace. Then recite the incantation *Jīn Guāng Chè Diàn Zhà* (\"Golden Light Pierces the Lightning Roar\"), repeating the five characters without counting the iterations.\n\n**Mechanism:**\nThe right signal emerges from the kidneys, passes through the five sense organs, and enters the sea of *qi*. A great thunderclap resounds, traversing the thirty-six barriers before bursting forth from the crown. The Five Thunders erupt in full force.\n\n**Inscribing the Golden Light in the *Xun* Palace**\n**Summoning Thunder: Oral Formula**\nThe master observes: \"The moon constantly conjoins *Xu* (11th Earthly Branch). Determine where the Celestial Pivot (*Tian’gang*) resides, face that direction, and visualize the Northern Dipper.\"\n\nNext, form the sword mudra and inscribe the character *lào* (炓) toward the Dipper’s mouth, imagining it flashing brilliantly. Visualize a strand of golden light surging from the glabella, shooting directly into that direction. With fury, inhale this character and guide it into the talisman with the sword mudra.\n\nAt this moment:\n- If the Celestial Pivot is in *Mao* (4th Branch), thunder arises.\n- If in *Si* (6th), wind.\n- If in *Wu* (7th), lightning.\n- If in *Zi* (1st), rain.\n- If in *Chen*, *Xu*, *Chou*, or *Wei* (5th, 11th, 2nd, 8th), clouds.\n\n**Redirecting Thunder**\nIf thunder resounds in the east, visualize the Northern Dipper fixed above. Use the sword mudra to inscribe *lào* at the Dipper’s mouth, then imagine golden light from the cinnabar field bursting from the celestial heart and shooting upward. With the sword mudra, guide it to another location to redirect the thunder’s response.\n\n**Heavenly Marshal Tianpeng Drives Thunder**\nVisualize the Nine *Qi* converging at the center, coalescing into a blue lotus seed. Suddenly, it splits open, revealing Marshal Tianpeng standing within, a single-horned *qiu* dragon at his right. Recite the command thrice, and the dragon roars while the marshal rages. The adept, likewise enraged, dispatches them to hasten the thunder envoys and command the myriad thunders.\n\n**The Blue Lotus Seed Contains Creation**\n**Lightning-Commanding Mudra**\nVirtually inscribe the character *□* in the right palm and *□* in the left. Rub the palms together until scorching hot, then visualize a golden light orb within. Next, imagine a golden *lào* character suspended in the clouds ahead.\n\nThe adept flicks the palms’ signal, transmuting it into a golden fire-star. With both palms facing outward, shoot the golden light—electrical radiance blazes, illuminating the vast sky.\n\nRecite:\n*\"Chaos of heaven and sea-mountains, lightning streams forth in brilliance—divine mechanism seizes!*\n*Golden light wrenches the lightning roar!*\n*Command: Cloud-lightning, swiftly arise!\"*\n\nUpon concluding the incantation, visualize two strands of golden light from the palms shooting toward the star, drawing forth the lightning’s surge.\n\n**Seal this method; do not neglect it.**\n\n**Method for Praying for Snow**\nThe master instructs: To invoke snow, conceal the moon and gather the Five Stars at the Eastern Well (*Dongjing*). Auspicious *qi* will flow abundantly—this is called \"assembling the Five Phases and harmonizing the Four Symbols.\" When the *dui*-harmony and *zhao*-harmony converge, auspicious *qi* arrives.\n\nAdd the character *du* (朒) beneath the talisman and overlay it with the Five Stars. Visualize the Great Yin (*Taiyin*) at the zenith, imagining the brush as the original star. The four remaining stars coalesce into auspicious *qi* and harmonious *qi*, suffusing mountains, rivers, and the Six Directions.

      "translated_text": "**Seated Practice**\nAt midnight, the hour of *zi*, rise and sit up. Don your robe, then rub your hands together until they grow scorching hot. Mimic washing your face, and wipe your eyes. Open them, exhale the turbid *qi* from your abdomen, and draw in pure *qi* through your nose to fill your heart and belly. Strike your teeth three times, and visualize your Original Destiny Perfected within your brows, standing in your likeness.\n\nNext, recite the *Incantation for Gathering Spirits*:\n*\"True King within the radiance, your might shakes the Nine Heavens.\nHands cradle the Three Pristine, feet tread the Nine Mysteries.\nGolden Tiger veils the sun, Azure Dragon coils the *Qian*.\nYellow Spirit wields iron, Green-Toothed lashes the whip.\nPatrolling the Five Peaks, harmonizing the Seven Primes.\nBy imperial decree, I transform and prolong life.\nSince the Great Ultimate first stirred, years have passed for me.\nNow wielding talismanic command, I grasp authority’s thunder.\nWind and thunder clash, lightning roars in fury.\nDividing day from night, I examine ghosts to their roots.\nMaster of the Thunder Bureau—justice knows no bias.\nAll I command must obey my word.\nSwift as the law’s decree!\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, visualize your primordial spirit ascending to pay homage to the True King. Three *cun* above the brows lies the True King’s palace. Next, envision the Ten Officials and Great Unity Perfected Lords encircling you.\n\nRecite the next incantation:\n*\"Jade Clarity congeals brilliance, the Nine *Qi* arise naturally.\nTransformations birth spirits across the Thirty-Six Heavens.\nSun and moon’s majestic light, thunder chariots vast as clouds.\nHeaven azure, earth black—annihilate demons, purge spirits.\nI now examine and judge, all heavens descend in audience.\nWind flies, lightning turns—ten thousand spirits obey.\nSwift as the Primordial One *Qi* Heavenly Lord’s decree!\"*\n\nNext, visualize the nine *qi* of the liver, emerald-hued, ascending to coil around the *Milo* Heaven. Then envision the three *qi* of the south, crimson, merging with the heart to form golden *qi*, blending within the spleen’s palace. Briefly hold your breath, and exhale this golden *qi* from the spleen to encircle your body.\n\nWith both hands, first lift the left external kidney with your left hand. Hold your breath once, and visualize kidney water surging upward then descending, uniting with heart fire to coalesce at the navel wheel. Press your tongue against your lower teeth, awaiting the water’s rise and fire’s descent. Swallow into the lung’s palace, where golden light intertwines, forming a Perfected who ascends to pay homage to the Primordial Void Emperor.\n\nRecite the *Lesser Golden Light Incantation*, swallow saliva three times, then stretch your hands to circulate the *qi* through mountains and peaks. The practice concludes—sleep as if in the outer Dipper.\n\n**Rainbow Manifestation Method**\nBefore noon, face west; after noon, face east. Assume the thunder mudra with your hands, gaze at the sun, and recite:\n*\"Sun’s soul, vermilion radiance, gleams through green jade.\nCrimson lads of returning mist, dark flames in whirlwind guise.\nBy my oral decree, swiftly reveal your true form!\nA thousand-mile rainbow, five-colored barrier.\nSwift by the Solar Emperor’s command!\"*\n\nAdditional incantation:\n*\"Rainbow, appear swiftly! Rain divides east and west.\nHasten! Stretch across the sky! Fill the void!\"*\n\nAfter reciting, exhale three breaths—it will manifest instantly in the air.\n\n**Shenxiao True Writ for Summoning Thunder and Invoking Rain**\nWrite every four characters as a separate line.\n\nUse azure paper, one *chi* and six *cun* long, inscribed in cinnabar. Face the *xun* direction to summon thunder spirits. Cast it into a dragon pool or present it to the Thunder Bureau—responses are unfailing. Writing one or two characters can cure myriad illnesses, expel all malevolence, and ensure safe passage through storms, dragons, or other perils. Upon achieving mastery, wear it to ascend to the Jade Clarity Heaven of Shenxiao, becoming an attendant minister of the Golden Towers.\n\nTo treat madness or demonic afflictions, add the *Xuhuo* talisman—results are immediate.\n\n**Convenient Talismans**\n*Eastern Barbarian Thunder Envoy Ma Yulin, swiftly arise! Chen writ, eastern azure *qi*, inscribe and activate!*\n*Southern Barbarian Thunder Envoy Guo Yuanjing, swiftly arise! Wu writ, southern crimson *qi*, inscribe and activate!*\n*Western Barbarian Thunder Envoy Fang Zhonggao, swiftly arise!

      "translated_text": "**Quiet Stabilization and Talisman Inscription**\nIn stillness, inscribe these two characters—*hēng* and *xián*—within the circle. Once the talisman is complete, recite the *Celestial Numen’s Splendor Mantra*. Draw in the eastern *qi*, then trace the following sequence: *gé-sì-zhèng-chén-jī-mǎo-gāng-yín-héng*, marking each on the thumb—first the upper joint, then the middle, then the root. Repeat and inscribe the *shà* character.\n\n**The Divine Empyrean’s Supreme Dao: Transmission of the Divine Empyrean’s Vibrant Teachings**\n\n**Arcane Secrets of Thunder’s Mechanism**\n**The Flying *Gang* and Interlocking *Qian* for Deploying the Dipper**\n\nThe Fire Master said: The Jade Clarity’s hidden language, the Primordial Origin’s secret texts—these are not for the uninitiated to hear. Once, the True King of Jade Clarity transmitted them to the Five Marchmounts’ Elders, who then passed them to the world.\n\nThunder and lightning are the *qi* of yin and yang clashing fiercely. There is the divine being Xie Xianhuo, the supreme commander of the seventy-two divisions of wind and fire. And there is the mighty spirit Deng Bowen, who wields the authority to issue decrees, burn demonic shrines, topple temples, summon rain, and command clear skies—he is the marshal of the Thunder Department’s statutes and ordinances.\n\nThose who uphold this method must practice it with care. Each year, during the three days before and after the *Jingzhe* (Awakening of Insects) festival in mid-spring, when thunder first sounds, enter profound meditation and transform the spirit as prescribed. Fill yourself with the *gang qi*, purify the viscera, and amplify divine might.\n\nNext, form the Five Thunder Seal, retract the claws and conceal the nails, cross the arms at the waist, sit upright, and with a stern voice and fierce countenance, shake the Gate of Heaven. Draw in the *qi* of lightning to align with the yang’s nine-by-nine configuration. From the earth gate, gather the *qi* of thunderfire to correspond with the yin’s six-by-six completion. Seize the lightning and flying thunder, and contain them within the primordial palace. Conceal them in the *Kan* trigram; whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, maintain this practice.\n\nWhenever thunder and lightning converge, act without delay. With sufficient *qi*, you may summon thunder in broad daylight, and it will naturally respond. In spring and summer, visualize the Wind Earl and Rain Master, the Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother, descending swiftly from the sky. In autumn and winter, envision thunder and lightning emerging from the stars and constellations.\n\nFor regular use, dispatch an observer to note the direction from which ominous clouds or malevolent winds arise. The ritual master then gathers primordial *qi*, hurls lightning, and roars thunder toward that direction, releasing it from the crown of the head. The response will arrive within an hour. After three years of practice, every invocation will yield immediate results.\n\nWhen summoning thunder, form the Five Thunder Seal and issue the command from *xū-hài* to *shēn*. Once the method is mastered, practice diligently to wield Heaven’s authority, succor the people and all beings, and expel demonic forces—this is no trifling matter.\n\nThe adept’s spirit merges with the divine, and their essence flows in communion with Heaven and Earth. Though Heaven and Earth are said to be eighty-four thousand *li* apart, the adept’s spirit traverses this distance within their own body. Thus, the myriad transformations arise within the self, and the cosmos rests in the palm of the hand.\n\nReflect deeply upon this, guard it well, and do not disclose it to the unworthy. The Dao does not betray those who attain it; through diligent effort and unwavering focus, one naturally achieves transcendence.\n\n**Master Wan’s Transmission** states: Thunder withdraws its voice in the eighth month, concealing itself beneath the *Kun* earth. From the eighth month (*yǒu*) to the tenth (*hài*), it nurtures within the three yin. From the eleventh month (*zǐ*) to the first (*yín*), it matures within the three yang. Only after the interplay of three yin and three yang does it resound in the second month (*mǎo*), marking the inception of Heaven and Earth’s generation and the first stirrings of all things. It must extend its pent-up emotions and release its stagnant *qi*, causing the pulse of Heaven and Earth to quake and the vitality of life to flow. Without great power, such a vast release would be impossible. After half a year of accumulation, it erupts in a single day—nothing in the myriad things can resist it, for it is the earth’s surplus blackness venting forth.\n\nThus, the day of its emergence is not arbitrary: it may be *wù-jǐ*, *chén-xū-chǒu-wèi*, or the day of *Lìchūn* (Beginning of Spring), all tied to the earth’s resonance with the cyclical signs of generation. Though exceptions exist, eight or nine out of ten cases align with this pattern. This is why the sages of old drew upon these correspondences to model the divine thunder’s fire.\n\nFor when the first yang returns and takes form beneath *wù-jǐ*, its momentum becomes irresistible. Thus, the creative forces of half a year’s decree must be nurtured in concealment for another half-year before their power is realized—how could this be a shallow matter?\n\n**Lightning Incantation**\n*Lightning, lightning,*\nemerging from the *Kan* direction.\nSpewing fire for ten thousand *li*,\nascending to the Celestial Palace.\nI invoke the Emperor’s salvation,\ndrawing it into the heart’s sovereign.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as lightning seizes!*\n\n**Jade Emperor’s Personal Mechanism Talisman and Mudra**\nWind as Heaven, *yín* fire as Earth,\n* sì* the sun and moon as conduits,\n*shēn* the four mountains to command and restrain.\n*hài* mountain’s fire blazes,\n*yín* mountain’s fire blazes,\n*mǎo* severs, *chén* severs, *sì* annihilates, *sì* seizes.\nAt *wǔ*, thunderfire emerges—point backward and flick once.\n\n**By Decree of the Three Clarities’ Emperors:**\nJade Clarity’s Supreme Emperor,\nSupreme Clarity’s Supreme Emperor,\nGrand Clarity’s Great Emperor,\nThunder Ancestor’s True August Emperor.\n\n**Constellation Decrees:**\n*Jiǎo, Kàng, Dǐ, Fáng, Xīn, Wěi, Jī,*\n*Dǒu, Niú, Nǚ, Xū, Wēi, Shì, Bì,*\n*Kuí, Lóu, Wèi, Mǎo, Bì, Zī, Shēn,*\n*Jǐng, Liǔ, Xīng, Zhāng, Guǐ, Yì, Zhěn.*\n\n**Five Planets’ True Lords:**\nMetal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth Star Lords.\nPalace of the Sun, Palace of the Moon.\nEastern Well and *Jī* Envoys, Thunder Duke,\nTwenty-Four *Qi* Thunder Dukes, Twelve Hourly Thunder Dukes,\nThirty-Six Celestial Dragon Thunder Hosts.\n\n**Thunder Summons:**\nHeavenly Thunder, rise swiftly!\nWater Thunder, rise swiftly!\nDragon Thunder, rise swiftly!\nDivine Thunder, rise swiftly!\nEarth Altar Thunder, rise swiftly!\nAs Heaven and Earth darken and sun and moon lose their light,\nthe Five Directions’ Thunder Gods descend swiftly to the Mystic Altar’s precinct.\n\nClose the eyes, rotate nine times, and with a single stroke ascend past the character *shān*.\n\n**Incantation:**\nFirst rotation: the cosmos quakes.\nSecond rotation: fierce winds arise swiftly.\nThird rotation: yin thunder merges.\nFourth rotation: the Great Monad’s *Lí* Palace.\nFifth rotation: the Five Thunders rise swiftly.\nSixth rotation: thunderbolts surge and strike.\nSeventh rotation: the Jade Talisman descends.\nEighth rotation: the myriad spirits hasten to obey.\nNinth rotation: thunder, lightning, wind, and rain—\nflying sand and hurtling stones—\nburst forth from the earth gate,\ndescend to the altar’s seat,\nhear the command and act,\ndare not disobey the decree!",

All fortune and misfortune, regret and shame in a person’s life are subject to its sway. The methods of petitioning the Dipper, transmitted by sages of former ages, each possess manifest efficacy. The purposes of such petitions vary, each with its own specialization.\n\nOur Patriarch, Sun the Perfected, in his flight of spirit to audience with the Thearch, chanced upon the Nine Heavens Mysterious Woman, who bestowed upon him this swift and essential whispered petition. The method is named *Stove Register*, and the lamp is called *Thousand Eyes*, dedicated to memorializing the Controller of Fate. Though the text is brief, its efficacy is swift.\n\nThe Controller of Fate is the Nine Heavens Efficacious Fire Primordial Lord, commissioned by the Heavenly Thearch to memorialize the affairs of the human realm. All prayers and supplications are invariably answered, for this is the utmost Dao in its unadorned simplicity. The Perfected, moved by compassion for the people of the world, transmitted it to later learners. Those who obtain it should preserve and revere it; it must not be shown to the unworthy.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Li Xisheng.\n\n---\n\n### **The Precious Register of the Mysterious Numinous for Prolonging Life, Delivering from Distress, and Dispersing Calamities**\nWith utmost reverence, I present this petition, unable to refuse the sincerity of the supplicant. I have heard that the Great Thearch, in his boundless grace, expounds the teachings of the Supreme True, while the August Elder proclaims the decrees of the Jade Bureau, and the Northern Dipper bestows the *Book of the Mysterious Numinous*. Its profundities defy description; its sagely power is unfathomable.\n\nFacing the Northern Culmen, I inscribe this talisman and register, recording the supplicant’s circumstances in accordance with ancestral protocols. Entrusted to the Controller of Fate for presentation, it ascends to the office of the Throat and Tongue, and descends to relieve the afflictions of the heart and viscera. May swift response be granted to fulfill this devout prayer.\n\nAll true talismans shall be duly proclaimed and enacted.\n\n**Void Talisman**\n\nThis talisman and register are dedicated to resolving for [Name] the Three Calamities and Four Baleful Influences, the Five Phases and Six Harms, the Seven Injuries and Eight Difficulties, the Nine Stars in fate, destiny, and life’s allotted span, and all inauspicious spirits and malevolent forces encountered in the current year—distresses of Heavenly Nets and Earthly Snares.\n\nI humbly beseech the Lord Controller of Fate to transmit this sincerity and memorialize it to the Star Lords of the Northern Dipper.

Those who cultivate immortality and refine the true must especially know them.\n\nWhenever the Three Terraces’ six stars are seen, clasp hands in reverence, visualize the bow, and silently recite the incantation:\n*\"Upper Terrace: Void Essence,\nMiddle Terrace: Sixfold Purity,\nLower Terrace: Curved Life.\nErase this servant’s name from death’s register,\nInscribe this servant’s name for eternal life.\nPromote to lofty rank,\nEnthroned in Heaven’s court.\nHeart and mind brighten,\nEars and eyes grow keen.\nThree souls endure forever,\nExtending life a thousand years.\nAscend to the Golden Gate,\nGaze upon Jade Clarity.\nRide the dragon, mount the clouds,\nAttain the rank of Immortal Minister.\nHasten, hasten, as the statutes command!\"*\n\n*\"The Three Terraces gave me birth,\nThe Three Terraces nurtured me,\nThe Three Terraces protect me.\nHasten, hasten, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nAfter reciting, gaze toward the stars’ celestial path, seek the grace of the Dao, offer prayers as you wish, bow thrice in the heart, and click the teeth three times before withdrawing.\n\n**Seeking the Imperial Throne Method**\nThe two stars at the Dipper’s mouth—the Venerable Star on the left, the Imperial Star on the right—shine like the sun and moon upon those of the Dao, but not upon the unvirtuous. Those who see the Venerable Star live three hundred years; those who see the Imperial Star live six hundred years.\n\nOn the third and twenty-seventh nights of each month, await their appearance. This must be done in the quiet of night, unknown to others. When the two stars appear, seek the Dao with wholehearted devotion, and tell no one. If one lacks perseverance, sincerity, or discipline, or grows lax midway, the stars will not be seen.\n\nThose who refine the true should secretly pray to them often, never revealing the stars’ names to the unworthy. Keep them constantly in mind, and in times of need, silently invoke their names. Never face north to weep, disrobe, or let hair loose beneath the stars’ light—this is the strictest prohibition.\n\nWhen awaiting the two stars, first pace the Dipper, burn incense, and bow twice, visualizing the Dipper’s mouth where the two stars appear like the sun and moon. Then recite the incantation:\n*\"Venerable and Imperial Stars,\nSpirits of the Northern Culmen.\nMay this servant soon behold you,\nAnd upon seeing, attain eternal life.\nInscribe this servant as a flying immortal,\nStrike this servant’s name from death’s register.\nBoundless fortune and blessings,\nEqual to Heaven’s years.\nSwiftly ascend to the Immortal Capital,\nSoar through Supreme Clarity.\nHasten, hasten, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nBow twice more, envisioning the two stars descending in purple cloud-qi, entering through your Mud-Pill Palace and bathing your eyes. Recite the incantation again:\n*\"Venerable and Imperial Stars,\nSpirits of the Northern Culmen.\nNow revealed, now concealed,\nGrant this servant eternal life.\nInscribe this servant as a flying immortal,\nStrike this servant’s name from death’s register.\nBoundless fortune and blessings,\nEqual to Heaven’s years.\nSoon transcend the Three Realms,\nRoam through Supreme Clarity.\nHasten, hasten, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nAfter reciting, bow twice more, stand briefly in stillness, focus the spirit, and gaze at the Dipper’s mouth while silently repeating the incantation seven times. Then withdraw for a short while. If the stars appear, bow again and pray for longevity, offering your heartfelt wishes. Continue nightly worship without interruption—any lapse nullifies all prior merit.\n\nThose of disciplined conduct who refine the true may transcend the mortal and enter the sagely, ascending to serve the Jade Emperor. Those who practice this with utmost dedication attain eternal life and ascend upon merit’s fulfillment. Ordinary practitioners extend their years. Do not reveal this to the unworthy; treasure and guard it well.\n\nFormerly, Supreme Perfection Realized Person of Wangwu Mountain transmitted this to Master Zhang Guolao, who practiced it in secret and later ascended as an immortal, becoming one of the ancient sagely transcendents.\n\n**Secret Crane-Summoning Method #2**\nCranes come in many kinds: the Bamboo Crane of Dongcheng, the Reed Crane of Jibin, the Soaring Crane of Huaishan, and the Feather Crane of Qingcheng Mountain—these are the common traditions of past and present. As when Celestial Master Han rode the Nine Clouds Crane, Perfected Lord Xu mounted the Wind-Riding Crane, Ge Zhichuan flew the Jade Mist Crane, and Perfected Lord Zhongli Zhengyang ascended on the Grand Empyrean Crane—such accounts are indeed true.\n\nThe proverb says: \"The stork bears three offspring, one of which is a crane\"—this refers to the crane born of the womb, not the feathered crane of Penglai, nor the cinnabar-crested crane of Purple Tenuity that cries to the heavens. It is neither the white-robed dancer of the Jasper Terrace nor the white-garbed whistler of the Celestial Pivot. How could Pure Yang Perfected Lord Lü’s crane be merely a fleeting apparition?\n\nWhen cranes come, they soar through autumn’s clear skies and cry to the deep night’s moon. Immortals who ride cranes come and go—truly, those who attain the Dao, refine the true, and transcend the dust may obtain this scripture and summon them with flying talismans. They will arrive in graceful flight, soaring through the heavens, not merely calling from the Nine Marshes.\n\n*Recorded by Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Dharma Master, Divine Empyrean Registrar, Commander of Thunder and Lightning Troops, Sea-Jade Realized Person Bai Yuchan.*\n\n**Lineage Masters:**\nMaster of the Vibrant Dao, Sovereign of All Immortals’ Teachings, Compassionate Savior of Huayang, Dao Lord of Longevity and World-Salvation, Immortal King of Azure Florescence, True Mysterious Numinous Response Heavenly Worthy Li Zhe.\nAncestral Master, Master of the Numinous True Teachings, Celestial Envoy of the Ninefold Golden Gate’s Immortal Selection, Supreme Clarity Wondrous Response Enlightenment and Dao-Transmitting Perfected Lord, Life-Protecting Controller of Destiny, Nation-Guarding Immortal King, Highest Primordial August Transformative Heavenly Worthy Zhongli Quan Yunfang.\nAncestral Master, Supreme Clarity Highest Realized Person, High Primordial Purple Void Pure True Primordial Lady Wei Huacun.\nAncestral Master, Master of the Upright True Teachings, Pure Yang Numinous Treasure Wondrous Penetration and Correct Transformation Perfected Lord Lü Yan Dongbin.\nAncestral Master, Master of the Illuminated True Teachings, Sea-Toad Enlightened Comprehension and Dao-Propagating Perfected Lord Liu Xuanying.",

      "translated_text": "May it deeply concern [Your Eminence] that the worldly and foolish remain deluded, disbelieving in the Dao and its methods. Now desiring to propagate the teachings and spread their influence, that the people may come to revere them and the Great Dao flourish, [I] humbly approach Your August Marchmount to request the loan of several simurghs and cranes. On such-and-such a day at noon, may they descend to the ritual altar, circling and dancing above and below, offering obeisance with bowed heads and bared forms. When the noon audience concludes, may they be immediately dispatched back to their posts, without daring to linger.\n\nFurthermore, [I] beseech the dispatch of the Blue-Green Controller of Cranes, the spirit officer of Penglai, to attend the altar and witness the covenant of the fast. This petition is hereby respectfully submitted.\n\n[Your] humble servant, [Name], most reverently presents this petition before the Sacred Thearch of the Southern Marchmount, Controller of Heaven’s Luminous Might. May Your Sagely Compassion deign to grant this earnest plea. Issue commands to the master of the Simurgh-and-Crane Bureau to promptly act in accordance with the matters herein submitted, swiftly dispatching them to ensure the ritual’s completion, transforming both humans and celestials, and perfecting the fast in all its aspects.\n\n[I], [Name], presuming upon Your Sacred Authority, am filled with trembling awe. Respectfully submitted.\n\nIn the year of ___, the ___ month, the ___ day, [Name], of such-and-such position, submits this petition.\n\nSubmitted to the Master of the Simurgh-and-Crane Bureau of Penglai Mountain, the Perfected Lord of the Day.\n\nOn the day following the ritual, a second missive shall be sent, dispatching the Perfected Officer of the current stellar lodge, along with the Directing Talisman, and the Intermediary Director of Merit-Officials, to urgently summon twelve, twenty-four, or thirty-six simurghs and cranes, as well as one spirit officer, to attend the altar. Issue the summons again.\n\nThe Seven Spirit Officers of Penglai Mountain Who Control Cranes:\nFirst Spirit Officer: Radiant Rosy Clouds\nSecond Spirit Officer: Jade Radiance\nThird Spirit Officer: Golden Fusion\nFourth Spirit Officer: Bian Wen\nFifth Spirit Officer: Treasure Radiance\nSixth Spirit Officer: Qi Yang\nSeventh Spirit Officer: Elegant Fruit\n\nThese seven spirit officers take turns beginning on the first day of each month. However, on the last day of the lunar month and the full-moon day, the spirit officer named Vermilion Lake does not fall under their jurisdiction and will not respond to summons. Only during the Nine-Yin Yellow Register Grand Offering to the Boundless Heavens will he arrive promptly. At other times, if summoned in jest or frivolity, the invocation will prove ineffective.\n\nThis method was taught by the Patriarchal Iron-Crutch Perfected Lord of All Immortals, the August Thearch of the East, who, atop Mount Qingcheng, assembled the host of immortals and summoned cranes from the Southern Marchmount, which arrived riding the void. When the affair concluded, they returned. The teaching was later transmitted to Zhongli, the Perfected Lord of Upright Yang, and to the Purple Void Perfected Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount. It was then passed to Lord Lü Dongbin, the Perfected Lord of Pure Yang, who transmitted it to the Immortal Liu Haichan. He, in turn, bestowed it upon the Purple Yang Perfected Lord Zhang of Mount Tiantai. From generation to generation, it has been transmitted thus, reaching the ninth-generation lineage-holding immortal master, the Jade Tube Immortal Elder, through whom it has spread unbroken to the present day.\n\nIn the final days of the jiachen year, I unexpectedly had the good fortune to attend a gathering at the Treasure Canopy Grotto of Wuyang, where I served with wholehearted devotion. On the celestial腊 day of the yisi year, I presented this petition with incense, prostrated myself, and entreated my master to accept me as a disciple, to enlighten me on the firing times of the golden elixir’s transformations. From that moment, the secret transmission resonated within me, and all proved true. Thus, I reflect that my master’s kindness towers higher than Mount Sumeru and runs deeper than the vast sea; though I were to grind my bones to powder, I could never repay such virtue.\n\nDid not my master say: “Diligence without encounter leads one to meet a perfected being; encounter without diligence consigns one to become a lowly ghost.” Day and night, through the twelve double-hours, I never forget this admonition. Resolutely, I press forward, my resolve growing ever firmer, vowing to attain the pure, liberated, supreme, and perfectly true Great Dao. Thereby may I deliver my primal ancestors, my three masters and dharma friends, and all karmically connected kin through countless kalpas, universally extending to all beings throughout the dharma realm, that together we may ascend to the joys of the immortals’ realm. How could I dare let this life slip by in vain?\n\nTime passes swiftly, and after several years, I unexpectedly obtained the immortal master’s book on summoning cranes—was this mere chance? Twice, thrice, I prostrated myself upon the earth, paying homage to the patriarchal and immortal masters, and was deemed worthy of receiving their transmission. Thus empowered, I may practice and uphold it, revering the immortal transformations and attaining fruition as a perfected being.\n\nThose who summon cranes must be cultivators of the true, bearers of registers, whose virtue extends to others, whose accumulated merits fill the heavens, whose beneficence nurtures the myriad people, who pray for timely rain and sunshine, who deliver the living and the dead, whose mysterious works are vast and profound, whose names are inscribed on the immortal ranks, and who hold offices of the first or second rank—only such may perform this rite. It is most efficacious.\n\nHowever, it must be conducted within the great karmic affinity of the Crane Assembly Fast of the Patriarchs, and only then may it be performed three days in advance. The appointed day and hour must be strictly observed for the invocation to prove effective. Those who are not of high rank, office, or virtue may not summon them.\n\nWhoever obtains this method must guard it carefully and not lightly disclose it. Those who do so will immediately incur heavenly retribution. How could one not be cautious? Keep it secret, keep it secret!",

First, he visualizes his body as withered wood, pinches the *wǔ* position with both hands, inhales a mouthful of southern *qi*, and blends it with his heart’s *qi* to form true fire. Flicking the *wǔ* position, he ignites the fire at the wood’s roots, burning upward all at once. Next, he pinches the *sì* position, summoning the *xùn* wind to scatter the ashes, leaving no trace of dust or shadow.\n\nHe visualizes an infant within his cinnabar field gradually growing, hair unbound and feet bare, clad in a black robe and golden armor, appearing like the True Warrior.

A red serpent exhales *qi*, merging with his heart *qi*; pinching the *wǔ* position, the serpent’s head stirs. The Northern Dipper enshrouds his body, the Three Terraces stand before him, a sun to his left and a moon to his right.

The lungs reside in the center; pinch the *yǒu* position. Visualize seven stars atop the right side of his head, each containing seven Daoists in plain white robes, blown by the western white *qi*. They descend behind the brain, down the spine, spiraling into the shoulder well, passing through the Twelve-Storied Tower to enter the lungs, standing within the jade palace.\n\nWisdom returns to the spleen; pinch the center of the middle finger. Visualize a monkey and a horse, suffused by the golden light *qi*. They descend from the center of the forehead, passing the Twelve-Storied Tower and the stomach’s entrance, where a golden child sprays water.

The monkey is devoured by a *ní* beast, the horse becomes a *bó* steed, and the *ní* stands atop the *bó*, both entering the spleen, which he visualizes as a golden chamber.\n\nEssence returns to the kidneys; pinch the *zǐ* position. Visualize two kidneys along the spine, fuzzy like the sun and moon, the left *qi* with nine strands, the right *qi* with ten rays, piercing straight through the crown to the Parents’ Palace—the Mud Pill Palace. There, he sees the Parents’ Palace’s purple *qi* descending in nine strands from the left; he taps his teeth and calls: \"Grand Unity Lord,\" three times. It flows directly into the kidneys. He calls: \"Peach Health Lord,\" three times. He sees a figure like himself entering the left kidney palace, black clouds dispersing, revealing a clear blue sky and bright sun. Again, he visualizes the Parents’ Palace’s purple *qi* descending in ten rays from the right; he taps his teeth and calls: \"Director of Destinies Lord,\" three times. It flows directly into the kidneys. He calls: \"Union and Extension Lord,\" three times. He sees a woman-like figure entering the right kidney palace, black clouds retreating, revealing a clear blue sky and bright sun. He visualizes a pool of water within the cinnabar field congealing into ice-jade, solid and unmoving, illuminated by the sun and moon’s radiance from the kidneys. Pinch the *zǐ* position.\n\nThe spirit returns to the heart; pinch the *wǔ* position. Visualize the True Warrior’s form within the cinnabar field, identical to his own, summoning the spirits of his entire body.\n\nThe secret incantation:\nMay the ten thousand spirits unite with my heart.\nSeven times.\n\nSoon, he sees the ten thousand spirits, all like stars, countless in number, ascending into the golden tower and jade chamber. He visualizes his heart like a great fire pearl, celestial flames blazing. The fire pearl holds a dewdrop in its mouth, which drips onto the true person’s body, drawing all the spirits to enter through his mouth into the pearl’s inner tower, where they recite scriptures.\n\nThe secret incantation:\nCinnabar Origin, Cinnabar Palace,\nmerge with the hundred spirits.\nThree times; pinch the *wǔ* position.\n\nManifesting the Four Numinous Beasts:\nThe Azure Dragon, Mèngzhāng; pinch *yín*, *jiǎ-yín*.

Before imprinting, first examine the child’s middle finger pulse. Then, with the previously heated needle, pierce the child’s middle joint to a depth of two *fen*, withdraw it, and observe the drop of toxic fluid that emerges.

Take a five-colored thread, roughly three *chi* in length, and pass it through the incense burner’s smoke. Visualize the Fire-Bell General amidst flames above, bell in left hand and fire-rope in right. Envision the general casting down the five-colored thread, which transforms into an iron chain. After a moment, encircle the child’s neck with the chain and bind it securely, beginning the knot at the child’s *gu men*. Next, burn the aforementioned talisman and place nine moxa cones upon the handprint in the ash, specifically at the middle joint of the middle finger where the imprint was made. Light a sesame oil lamp and apply seven moxa cauterizations.

Use approximately two *sheng* of pure ash, stored in a clean vessel. Set up a spirit tablet, inscribing it: *Immortal Assembly of the Purple Maidens of Penglai*. Sweep and purify the chamber, placing the three items within. Perform morning and evening offerings with utmost purity.\n\nWhen making a petition, spread the ash upon the table’s surface. Bring the basket near, and the officiant burns the talisman while reciting the invocation. Upon completion, have a virtuous and refined person stand as the guest, while the officiant stands as the host, each lightly supporting the basket with empty hands, flanking the table. The chopstick will prick the ash—when the immortal arrives, the basket stirs, or writes the character *zhi* (至, \"arrival\"), or *jiang* (降, \"descent\"), or the name and title of the descending immortal. Offer libations as the heart dictates, and present the petition’s intent. Whether seeking to resolve abstruse meanings in scriptures, compose literature, inquire into secrets, attain perfection, divine fate, arrange marriages, or assess the *fengshui* of dwellings or graves, all may be spiritually communicated. Illustrious worthies of former ages—such as the Banished Immortal of Fragrant Mountain or Dongpo of West Lake—have occasionally descended, their words beyond mere counsel. When the writing fills the space, transcribe it, then sweep the ash smooth to continue. If the initial invocation fails to summon, do not resent or profane it; persist in repeated entreaties, and the spirit will be moved to descend without fail. With years of practice, the basket may be suspended by a cord, unsupported by hands, or the chopstick replaced with a brush to write upon paper—all depends on the matter at hand.\n\nWhen the immortal descends, hasten to bow; delay but slightly, and they depart.\n\nRecite the **Water Spell for Purification**:\n*\"Heaven generates water with the One; Earth completes it with the Six.\nOne and Six unite, and the Five Phases are founded.\nI now command the sprinkling to cleanse—filth flees like flying dust.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!\"*\nUpon finishing, sprinkle the water to purify the chamber.\n\nNext, light incense at the stove, face east, and knock the teeth together while silently praying:\n*\"I, [Name], bow my head and prostrate myself twice, reverently invoking the Primordial Lady of the Nine Heavens. Today, in accordance with the true precepts, I inscribe the numinous talisman to summon the Immortal Assembly of Penglai.

Pierce the Xun Gate, merging the fire-light with the golden light into a single mass.

Draw it back to the altar to receive commands.\n\n**The Northern Emperor’s Rite for Cleaving Ghostly Fetuses and Ghostly Qi**\nThe master faces north, visualizing the body as the Six Jia spirits. Hold a battle-axe in the right hand and form the Six Ding mudra with the left hand’s third finger at the second joint—do not move, for movement nullifies its efficacy.\n\nNext, envision the earth as the Black Prison of Fengdu.

Around the body—left and right, above and below—radiant orbs of light appear. This is the wind, thunder, lightning, clouds, and rain inherent in one’s own body, transforming in unfathomable ways.

One may then sit and summon, stand and invoke, with responses as swift as a moment. Command spirits and employ generals, summon rain and stir winds—just as when using talismanic water to treat illness and expel evil.

      "translated_text": "Suddenly forget the form, and visualize within the Lower Cinnabar Field an infant in its newborn state. The five *qi* of the five viscera, each bearing its corresponding color, ascend to the Middle Field. The infant transforms into a Perfected Person, mirroring your own form, with the Four Beasts arrayed before, behind, left, and right.\n\nThe Perfected Person ascends the layered tower to the Mud Palace of the Nine Palaces, visualizing the Three Masters seated upon jeweled thrones, vast as lotus seeds, the sun and moon radiantly clear. The Perfected Person kneels and recites, as do the Three Masters, their mouths emitting true *qi* that pours into your body. Upon completing the recitation, next visualize a Fire Dragon emerging from the heart. The Perfected Person mounts the Fire Dragon, spiraling through the Dipper and past the Winnowing Basket, ascending directly to the summit of the Empyrean beneath the Thunder Citadel.\n\nAfter recitation, with the brows’ surge, open the outer Thunder Palace. Beneath the many Jade Towers, the Three Masters sit together, flanked by the host of Perfected Officials. The Perfected Person kneels and recites as before, without fixed repetitions, following the intent of the prayer. Then, descending from the Mud Palace of the Niwan to the Middle Palace, the Perfected Person reverts to its original form and returns to the Lower Cinnabar Field, seated within a sphere of azure jade and lapis lazuli radiance. After twenty-seven days, there is no need to visualize the infant—only the Perfected Person. Proceed from the heart upward to the Mud Palace of the Nine, bowing in homage to the Perfected King, then return to the Crimson Chamber, seated within the Jade Light.\n\nThis Way is most secret; practice it with utmost care. Should even a trace of worldly thought intrude, perfection will not be attained. Not only will the numinous response be faint, but one may incur reproach from the celestial bureaus. Such is the subtlety of the inner workings of recitation.\n\nThe humble official, your subject [Name], on this day prostrates with purified heart, mouth, and body, offering devotion and presenting this petition to the Jade Pure Perfected King, the Southern Culmen Longevity Great Emperor, the Eastern Culmen Azure Radiance Great Emperor, the Great Unity Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy, and the Nine Heavens’ Hanwen Personage, the Vermilion Mound Life-Deliverance Heavenly Worthy. May the celestial compassion cast its radiance downward to bear witness.\n\nYour subject delights in longevity and has received the transmission of the supreme Dao, vowing to relieve the afflictions of the people. Now, first invoking the correct *qi* and aiding the circulation of the precious talismans, I humbly beseech the Perfected King’s longevity-*qi* and the *qi* of the sun’s essence and moon’s splendor to descend and infuse me. May my Three Fields and Nine Palaces, the hundred bones and five limbs, the eighty-four thousand pores, the twelve thousand rays of essence, and the three hundred sixty joints be inwardly and outwardly luminous, with *ying* and *wei* fully replete. May the Three Lights merge, the Five *Qi* return to the Origin, the body be purified, and the ten thousand *qi* suffuse the cosmos. When employing talismans, dispatching generals, or capturing malevolent spirits and vanquishing demons, may the response be immediate and the spirits obedient.\n\nAbove, I pray for the protection of the state and the peace of households, benefiting people and aiding all beings. Next, may my ancestors of myriad generations, the suffering souls in darkness, ascend to the celestial realms, their bodies secure and at peace, bowing before the Perfected King and ascending to the Golden Towers.\n\nYour subject’s heart is filled with boundless reverence and devotion. Thus, I speak.\n\n**Forming Emptiness into Brahma Mantra**\nForm emptiness into Brahma, and true *qi* arises spontaneously.\nVermilion script on jade, the Eight Might Dragon Script.\nPreserve and regulate the kalpic destiny, ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance.\nHeal illness and sever evil, bringing peace to all things.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Longevity Great Emperor’s statute and command!*\n\nFacing east, bow thirty-six times from the heart, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and visualize true *qi* coalescing into the Divine Empyrean Lord. Within the radiant *qi* of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Golden Light Jade Terrace, behold the Divine Empyrean King descending upon a golden terrace and jade hall, with vermilion doors and emerald windows, clad in purple robes and regal cap. Crimson slippers rest upon a jade mat; to his left, the sun; to his right, the moon. From the crown of the Perfected King’s head descends azure *qi* with nine rays, red and purple with three rays, gently wafting downward. With the heart’s red *qi* and the liver’s azure *qi*, I surge upward to meet and intertwine, inhaling eighty-one breaths to gather in the Lower Field, forming the sun; sixty-four breaths to the Upper Field, forming the moon; thirty-six breaths to the Middle Field, forming a pearl, clear as water, within which the Perfected King resides.\n\nBow nine times from the heart and recite:\nThe Three Lights radiantly clear, ascending to the Nine Heavens.\nGolden chambers and jade halls, where the Five Treasures and magic mushrooms grow.\nMysterious yellow and purple *qi* come to illumine my body.\nJade lads and jade maidens bring me their numinous power.\nThe Nine *Qi* unite as one, the Three Lights merge in harmony.\nAbove floats the Purple Canopy, ascending into the Purple Court.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Pure Perfected King’s statute and command!*\n\nThe Azure Radiance Emperor Lord, the Divine Empyrean Perfected King.\nThe Fusang Sun Emperor, the Western Culmen Moon Sovereign.\nThe Four Perfected and Three *Qi* coalesce into azure luminous radiance.\nThe *qi* of the Four Perfected Saints’ essence merges into one, forming a vibrant azure hue like grapevine, clear as water. It permeates the Three Fields. Above, at the center of the brows; in the middle, at the heart; below, beneath the navel—there dwell the Three Corpse Spirits, which the golden light subdues. Within, visualize the Perfected King. The Perfected King appears within the azure *qi*, consuming at dawn and bowing at dusk, tirelessly ascending in golden light.\n\nMy body possesses golden light, connecting to the Thirty-Two Heavens.\nThe sun and moon revolve within; the heart and kidneys intermingle.\nNext, employ the golden light to connect with the Perfected King in the Divine Empyrean Heaven, the sun to his left, the moon to his right. With the heart and kidneys of my body intermingling, internally revolve them as one.\nThe Azure Empyrean Jade Chamber.\nHere, the sun, moon, heart, and kidneys each return to their place, exhaled into unity, so that my body is no longer seen—only the spontaneous Perfected King. Then, one may summon generals and command troops.\n\nInhale the jade radiance.\nDraw in *qi* to the Cinnabar Field, and malevolent spirits vanish of themselves; the Three Corpses perish.\nThe malevolent *qi* of my body is eradicated. Three nines yield seven; bow before the Perfected King.\nFirst, gather the Four Perfected and Three *Qi*, uniting them in my Cinnabar Field, like the azure luster of grapes, its light illuminating the ten directions. Next, borrow the true fire of the Three *Qi* from the south, blazing forth to the east, where the wood sees the fire grow ever fiercer. Passing slightly beyond the Kan position, it reaches the west, the metal of the seven numbers, transforming into the Perfected King, golden and radiant. I am then the Perfected King. Afterward, my Perfected Person emerges, bowing thirty-six times before the Perfected King, as the myriad generals pay homage. This is yet another swift method.",

It descends through the nine earths and nine ramparts, following intention to the Mysterious Pivot Palace. Draw a mouthful of northern *qi*, blending it in the Yellow Court Palace. Rub the face and comb the hair, visualizing the luminous white *qi* arriving from the west. Massage the Inner Pass nine times and the Outer Pass nine times.

On such days, the Celestial Generals don their crowns to attend the Primordial Origin; those who practice the arts must be aware of this.\n\n**Primordial August Talisman**\n*Primordial August Talisman descends.*\n□□□□□□\n□□□□□□\n□□□□□□\n□□□□□□\n\nThis talisman is addressed to the Golden Gates of the Primordial August, to be executed in accordance with the decree.\nOnce the *Talisman for Affairs* arrives, the myriad spirits obey in unison.\nFollow the commands of the talisman and act swiftly.\n\n**Decree:**\nThis talisman is inscribed on yellow paper with cinnabar for prayers of clear skies, on black paper with ink for prayers of rain, and on blue paper with white powder for prayers of snow.\n\n**Divine Might Incantation**\nWind and thunder rise, lightning and thunder are born,\nDivine might descends, swiftly heed the decree.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the thunder’s law and command!*\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, draw *qi* three times into the five viscera, sealing them with *qi* to manifest authority. Then, with the *zi* trigram in the left hand and the *hai* trigram in the right, silently summon:\n- Rampart General Zhao Shouyan,\n- Rampart-Building General Xiong Xiushang,\n- Rampart-Activating General Tian Zhanyao.\nEnvision the three generals all present before you.\n\nNext, step outside the rampart and circle left three times—this is called \"restraining the three hun and stabilizing the seven po.\" They must not step beyond the rampart’s bounds. Then, step the *Breaking Earth and Summoning Thunder Rampart*.\n\n**Mnemonic Formula:**\n*Xun* double, *Li* to the right, *Kun* single to the left,\n*Zhen* single to the right, *Dui* is double.\nGhost’s Gate to the left, *Kan* to the right,\nHeaven’s Gate stands double, gaze upon the Celestial Rampart.\n\n**Rampart Incantation**\nJade Pivot Divine Rampart, obeying the Perfected King’s teachings,\nBreaking earth to summon thunder, executing iniquity and calamity.\nFive Thunder Messengers, swiftly attend the altar.\nFollow my incantation and decree, dispelling misfortune.\nUnlock the Five Departments, descending great divine radiance.\nInfuse my brush and inkstone, inscribing celestial seal-script.\nWater demons vanish,\nGhostly paths flee in terror.",

Dressed in a short white robe, tied at the chest, beneath which he is fully clad in golden armor. Black boots, his feet resting upon two water wheels.

      "translated_text": "Once the *Total Seizing Talisman* is inscribed, summon forth the great spirit to stand in the *Xun* Palace, bearing the golden writ. With mudras formed in hand, call forth the hundreds and thousands of palace officials to the altar, drawing them all at once into the golden writ. They are entirely transformed into golden light, then absorbed into the talisman—the talisman being the golden writ itself.\n\n**The Five Envoys and Their Uses**\n*Eastern Envoy, Jiang:* Governs healing, expelling evil, and seizing malevolent spirits. Pacifies people, protects creatures, and fulfills all prayers and petitions.\n*Southern Envoy, Bi; Western Envoy, Hua:* For prayers of rain, face the drought-stricken direction, form the mudra, and summon them. Inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on black paper. Recite the incantation while spraying water from an eel’s mouth, and black clouds will surge forth, thunder and rain arriving instantly. Point to where the dragon stirs. When employing these envoys, they command the local earth spirits and the Thunder Department, bringing rain across forty *li*. If possessing a body, they immediately transmit the Five Envoys—these envoys are most mighty and fierce.\n*Northern Envoy, Lei; Central Envoy, Chen:* In practicing the Five Talismans, resonance must arise between heart and mouth. Inscribe in cinnabar on yellow paper, burn each talisman to ash, and swallow it with an infusion of *jiangzhen* incense. For prayers of clear skies or rain, the response is extraordinary. To exorcise malevolent spirits, use gold coins and cloud-horses to swiftly attain efficacy. When first practicing, recite the incantation daily, inscribe the talismans according to the method, and swallow them for sixty days—then the thunder spirits will respond at once.\n\n**Steps for Praying Rain**\n*First Day:* Establish the altar and install the positions of the thunder spirits. Submit the memorial petition, attaching the left writ to the document.\n*Second Day:* At dawn, dispatch the Five Envoys. Next, bury the *yang* talisman and burn the *yin* talisman. Press the left hand upon the thunder chart, sit facing *Xun* from *Qian*, and draw a mouthful of *Xun* qi, swallowing it into the cinnabar field. Keep the right hand’s thunder chart pressed against the navel, unmoving. For example, on a *jiazi* day, visualize the eastern blue qi generating southern fire; the southern red qi generating central earth; the central yellow qi generating western metal; the western white qi generating northern water; and the northern black qi generating eastern wood. Then, with the left hand, form the mudra of Envoy Zhang and summon him before the altar to attend to the matter. Extol the divine charioteers, and invoke the Five Envoys—Yu, Bi, Hua, Lei, and Chen—of the *Yushu Slaying and Investigating* Department. With the sword mudra, cleave open the *Xun* gate. The ritual master presses the tongue to the upper palate, visualizing the incense smoke as a golden bridge extending to the *Xun* gate. Recite the heart incantation of the Five Envoys, and the envoys of the five directions descend along the golden bridge to stand before the incense burner on the altar.\n\nThe ritual master exhales the liver’s blue qi to summon Envoy Chen; exhales the spleen’s yellow qi to summon Envoy Lei; blows the kidney’s black qi to summon Envoy Bi; breathes the heart’s red qi to summon Envoy Hua; and sighs the lung’s white qi to summon Envoy Jiang. These merge with the incense smoke and the Five Envoys. According to the time limit set by the matter’s intent, offer prayers and dispatch them to ascend to heaven, commanding the clouds and governing the rain. Employ the double chart: circulate from the kidneys to the crown, then execute the mudra for wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning, casting it outward.\n\n*Third Day:* After the meal, ascend the altar. Burn talismans to dispatch the envoys. Recite the *Three Purities Incantation* and the *Golden Light Incantation*. Unfurl the banner, plant the sword, and summon Envoy Zhang. Burn the urgent summons, the official document, and the right contract. Dispatch the envoys and ritual masters into refinement, or rest briefly. Summon the Generals of Establishing the *Gang* and Treading the Dipper, step the *Breaking Earth* and *Thunder Gang*, or the *Dipper Gang*, or the *Wind, Cloud, Thunder, Rain, and Lightning Gang*. Step the *Thunder Gang* to *Qian*, then exhale qi to transform it into a golden bridge leading directly before the ancestral masters. Lead the celestial officials of the Golden Palace forward to submit the memorial. Upon receiving the decree, step the *Yin Dipper Gang*, descend, and exit the celestial gate. Hold the *Jade Text* in the left hand and the *Heavenly Flail* in the right, or form the sword mudra. Step to the *Xun* direction and inscribe in the void: *\"By the Emperor’s command, urgently summon the thunder spirits.\"* The *Xun* gate swings wide open. Issue the order to summon Envoy Zhang and all the generals, merging with the previous incantation.\n\nThen perform the triple offering and blood oath. First, burn the *Opening Thunder City Talisman* and the talismans of all the generals to dispatch them. Whether joyful or wrathful, send them forth one by one, setting a deadline for clouds to rise and rain to fall, greatly manifesting efficacy. Use the *yin* chart on *yin* days and the *yang* chart on *yang* days.\n\n**Example of Cloud-Raising**\nSuppose today at the *yin* hour, you receive the petition for prayer, or to rouse thunder to strike a temple or slay evil. First, inscribe the eastern talisman, consume one copy yourself, then burn another over the incense. Close your eyes, calm your heart, and visualize your body as withered wood, burned by fire and reborn as an infant. Envision the liver’s blue qi stretching thousands of *zhang* toward the eastern *yin* position. After a long while, step the *gang* and kick the *yin* position, shouting: *\"Eastern Wind and Thunder Envoys, subordinate to the *yin*-hour Direct Talisman Thunder Spirit, swiftly raise clouds in this direction!\"* After a long while, visualize the eastern blue qi stretching thousands of *zhang* into your body, then inhale the form of the eastern talisman, directing it straight east. Slightly open your eyes to observe—vigorous clouds will arise. If clouds appear in all four directions, break the cloud qi of the primary direction to exalt its supremacy. If wind arises from the east as a sign, this is called *Overlapping the Correct Chart*. Then employ the *Counter-Flow Method*: face the western *shen* position to draw the eastern qi, blow it toward the west, and again blow the eastern talisman toward the west. Pray: *\"The eastern direct talisman general has already manifested cloud qi. Western counter-flow *shen*-hour direct envoy thunder spirit, swiftly respond with cloud qi to fulfill the vow!\"* If the response is slow, blow the lung’s qi upon the western talisman toward the western *shen* position—it will respond at once. Thereafter, follow your heart’s prayers to summon rain or rouse thunder, all according to your intent. Finally, burn the *Pass Document* to set the day and hour, and the great response will be attained.\n\nOnce the talismans are circulated in succession, guide each direction’s qi and the Five Envoys’ talismans into their respective palaces to station and reside. When employing them, use the talisman of the corresponding palace along with the Five Envoys’ talismans. For the eastern talisman, draw it into the liver palace through the nose.",

Next, inscribe the clear-sky command, smear it with the incantation, and conclude with a yellow character to seal it. For rain, reverse the process; for exorcism, use the neutral method. Still visualize the messenger entering the talisman, golden light filling it. Then seal it with the Dipper’s *qi*, as one black divides into three. First inscribe your own command at the top. When burning the talisman, circulate the transformation, visualizing the *chì* character in the sky to hasten it.

      "translated_text": "Burn incense and recite the middle chapter once, visualizing the Most High Lord Lao above. Recite the sacred title of the Golden Watchtower’s transformed body and inscribe the talisman. The talisman should be five *cun* square, measured by the standard rule. According to the four seasonal incantations for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, write the petition talisman in ink on the reverse and in cinnabar on the front, then seal the back with cinnabar while reciting the incantation. The petition talisman must be inscribed on the back of the main talisman, though it should not be too large. Write: “On such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour, dispatched from such-and-such a place, divined to receive a response on such-and-such a month, day, and hour—how the report shall manifest. Awaiting the master’s decree, so-and-so bows in reverence.”\n\nFor exorcising malevolent spirits or dismantling shrines, use black paper with cinnabar script. For praying for rain, use blue paper with cinnabar script, or yellow paper with cinnabar or ink script. For praying for clear skies, use red paper with cinnabar script. The talisman’s efficacy awaits a response within two hours—if sent at *chen*, expect a reply by *wu*.\n\n**When submitting a petition for the household:**\nClasp the Dipper Mudra with the left hand, from *zi* to *wu*, and visualize a red light rising from the heart. Then flick the mudra, directing it straight toward the Celestial Gate in the north, imagining the red light extending from the altar to the gate, boundless across ten thousand *li*. The Four Direct Messengers stand before the petitioner, one holding the household petition in hand, while the officials of the ritual register follow behind. Together, they ascend upon the red light.\n\nAfter a while, a long bridge appears, its fine rays shimmering. Crossing it, they continue forward on the red light until, in an instant, a twelve-tiered golden tower comes into view. Ascending its steps, they ride the red light onward, passing a crimson bridge before reaching the Jade Watchtower of the Central Heaven, its paths wreathed in clouds and mist.\n\nUpon entering the watchtower’s base, the officials of the ritual register and the accompanying generals remain below to await. Only the Four Direct Messengers enter the gate, turning right toward the Hall of the Protective Sage. There, the gates are heavily guarded, with officials, generals, and thunder deities arrayed in formation. Entering, the Four Direct Messengers present the household petition to the True Officer of Memorials. The officer receives it with joy, bowing in reverence, and leads the petitioner straight to the palace steps. After nine prostrations, ascend the left dragon-tail staircase to the hall. Kneel before the imperial desk and present the petition as desired.\n\nWhen finished, descend the left dragon-tail staircase, perform nine prostrations in gratitude, and depart directly to the gate. There, the Four Direct Messengers await, leading the Demon-Quelling Generals and their retinue of officers and soldiers back to the Jade Watchtower of the Central Heaven. The officials of the ritual register, overjoyed, and the celestial generals escort the petitioner along the original path back to the altar.\n\nFinally, visualize the red light returning to the heart like a ball of fire. Strike the teeth together three times, swallow saliva three times, and withdraw.\n\n**Characters to avoid in household petitions:**\n*Qi* (乞), *zhong* (仲), *xia* (瞎), *zei* (贼), *chen* (陈), *fang* (方), *gao* (告), *jinming* (进明).\nDo not use these in pairs.\n\n**Dispatching the household petition and sending forth the generals.**",

Employ the Mudra of Command, visualizing this character at the Dipper’s mouth, directing the messenger to swiftly raise the *xun* wind—or the wind of any specified direction. To invoke rain, summon the *qian* direction’s wind; the *xun* wind must not be used.\n\nOnce the wind responds, direct it toward tall trees or dense forests, guiding it with intent. Test it upon a candle flame to reverse its course.

Remain motionless and inactive, reducing them to fine dust.\n*Swift, swift!* As the decree commands to restrain and subdue.\n\nWith both hands, form the Thunder Formation and strike it into the *Kui*, *Gang*, and Golden Well.\n\n**Six-Character Secret Incantation for Seizing Malevolence:**\n*Swiftly seize, swiftly drag, swiftly shackle, swiftly restrain, swiftly behead, swiftly annihilate.*\n\nThis method is most secret. Internally, it is transmitted to lineal disciples; externally, to sincere and devoted disciples. Only after making vows before the myriad heavens may it be imparted.\n\n**Fire Bells and Refinement Practices**\nThe adept visualizes within the Yellow Gate and Purple Portal, beneath the Flowery Canopy, nine luminous stars, each roughly an inch long. Within the Dipper, the Three Terraces lie horizontally at its head: the Upper Terrace aligns with *Xuan* Star, the Middle Terrace with the center of the hairline, and the Lower Terrace with the crown of the head.\n\nThree Terrace Immortals, clad in yellow robes and yellow crowns, emerge. The Three Terrace Stars emit fiery light, within which stand two spirits, each roughly three inches tall, three feet from the face. Both wear red robes and crowns, each holding fire bells. Their radiance spans ten thousand *zhang*.\n\nAfter a long while, one of the Three Terraces’ yellow lights enters the Dipper from three directions. The yellow light from the Gate and Portal enters, suffusing the five viscera. The two luminous essence-spirits, now transparent and fiery, return to reside before the heart. They exhale fire, coiling it threefold around the body. Hold the breath, burning the body until it becomes thoroughly heated. Then exhale, click the teeth nine times, and the fire disperses into golden light. The spirit transforms into a nine-foot form, wielding flowing-gold fire bells, ever attendant at one’s left and right.\n\nVisualize the body as the color of fine jade. The Terraces and Dipper follow the establishment of the method.\n\nThus, after one year, one repels misfortune; after two years, one repels weapons; after three years, one becomes deathless. The face radiates purple light, and the body resides unburned within fire. After nine years, yin dissipates and yang flourishes, and one ascends through the smoke.\n\nPractice this visualization daily.\n\nWhen inscribing talismans for refinement, first visualize the body as prescribed. Only then begin inscribing the talisman. Press the *Li* character, draw the upright *qi* from the Upper Palace, and exhale it onto the talisman’s heart.\n\n**Marshal Deng’s Thunderbolt and Foul Smoke Talisman**\nBy command of the Revered Fire Deity, Deng Bowen divides his body and transforms his *qi* to enter the talisman.\nSwift Smoke Envoys Cui Xuan and Foul Smoke Envoys Xiang Di—\nThunderfire swiftly arises at *Si* and *Wu*,\nLightningfire flies through the sky at *Yin* and *Wu*.\nOpen the Gate of Heaven, close the Door of Earth,\nseal the Human Gate, block the Ghost Road,\nthe Eight Poles’ thunderfire chariots—\nThunderfire, fire roars with eight million hosts.\nThe Five Directions’ fire chariots, thunderbolts, and foul smoke\nburn and strike demonic thieves, restoring peace to the human realm.\nEast: Thunderfire swiftly arises.\nSouth: Thunderfire swiftly arises.\nWest: Thunderfire swiftly arises.\nNorth: Thunderfire swiftly arises.\nCenter: Thunderfire swiftly arises.\nStars fly, lightning turns, beheading meteors.\nThe Southern Fire Thearch descends true *qi*—\n*Swiftly save, swiftly slay, swiftly seize!*\n*Swift, swift!* As the Fire Bells command to seize.\n\nFierce thunder swiftly arises, traversing the Celestial Stem.\n*Hong, hong, hua, lian*—save, respect, seize.\n\n**Secret Incantation:**\n*Lightning, frost, thunderbolt, blazing fire—*\nthe form and spirit silently decree.\nHeaven decrees, heaven seizes, heaven annihilates.\nEarth decrees, earth seizes, earth annihilates.\n*Om*, Heavenly Sovereign *Gaya*, thunderbolt—seize!\nAt *Chen* and *Xu*, the Dipper’s thunderbolt and golden light swiftly descend.\nEnter the name within the Heavenly Firelight.\nDecree: *Xu* fire traverses the sky, dominating—\nMarshal Deng Bowen arrives instantly.\n\n**Decree Incantation:**\nMighty spirits of the law and command,\nlords of wind and fire,\nwith massive arms and giant wings,\nyou soar through heaven and earth.\nYou behead demons and devour iniquity,\nbind ghosts and gather pestilence.\nYou summon rain in an instant,\nbring clear skies in a moment.\nHolding the Emperor’s decree,\nyou govern the Fire Thunder Lords.\nAt my single summons,\nswiftly emerge from the *Xun* Gate.\n*Hasten!*\n\nAfter reciting this incantation, draw the red-golden light-*qi* from the *Xun* direction into the talisman, visualizing it as the Marshal.\n\n**True Form Talisman of the Great Deity**\nThis is the Great Deity’s personal command to marshal numinous spirits, subdue evil, destroy temples, summon dragons, and bring rain.\n\nIf a ritual master ingests one talisman on the fifth day of the fifth month, they may command wind and thunder. Their body emanates jade-like light, and upon summoning the Great Deity, he arrives instantly. Inscribe it in cinnabar on green paper, ingest it, and burn it while facing the *Xun* Gate to summon him—he will respond immediately.\n\nWhen inscribing talismans, await the *Gang* star’s alignment with the proper direction before acting. Form the Thunder Formation with both hands, face the southeast, and visualize the Thunder Sound Universal Honored One within a nine-colored halo. Clad in crimson robes, draw nine breaths of golden light-*qi* through the nose, swallowing them into the heart. Visualize the Universal Honored One entering one’s numinous viscera, then transform into the Universal Honored One. Facing Marshal *Xu* Fire, recite the incantation:\n\n*Reverently summon Marshal Deng Bowen of the Southern Xu Fire and Law Command. Swiftly arrive beneath my Northern Dipper’s Kui and Gang stars to await orders.*\n*Hasten, hasten!*\n\n*By the Emperor’s decree, I urgently summon the Five Thunders.*\nClouds race, lightning flashes,\nassisting my practice.\nMight sweeps away iniquity,\nbeheading demons and vanquishing wrong.\nWhere the divine light shines,\nten thousand ghosts are crushed.\nSwiftly summon with flowing bells,\nthunderfire roars and flies.\n*Om.*\n*Xu, li, chi, hong*—\nfour eyes, nine uglies—\nthunder’s sound, lightning’s light—seize!",

By the Law Command of the Highest Divine Empyrean True King.*\n\n**Inner Recitation Formula of the Divine Empyrean**\nThe Realized One acts as before, entering the Three Heavenly Gates, proceeding directly to the southeast, the august Xun position. Amidst verdant forests and azure mists, cascading streams swirl—there stands a grand palace, the abode of the Great Emperor of Longevity. The guards are arrayed in solemn formation, as in the Great Mystery’s court.\n\nThe Realized One, from the Crimson Palace, ascends the layered towers, crosses the rainbow bridge, and enters the Central Heavenly Gate. Passing through the Three Heavenly Gates, he beholds the towering palace halls, golden tablets and jade inscriptions proclaiming the *Divine Empyrean Jade Treasury*. The Realized One then enters to pay homage and recite the scripture, whether for others or himself. After reciting the scripture seven times, he repents of sins and prays for blessings as before. Bowing twice, he takes leave, exiting the Three Heavenly Gates, crossing the rainbow bridge, descending the layered towers, and returning to the Crimson Palace, where he swallows saliva to conclude.\n\nThe recited scripture is the *Divine Empyrean’s Jade Chapters*.\n\n**Silent Audience Formula of the Divine Empyrean**\nFor the silent audience, proceed to the Three Heavenly Gates marked by golden tablets and jade inscriptions. Do not enter this gate; instead, face the southeast and pay homage to the Divine Empyrean’s palace. Donning red robes, recite the Feathered Chapters. Visualize the True King and the host of Realized Ones on his left and right, all chanting in unison the True King’s golden radiance of right qi, merging with one’s body. Then bow deeply or kneel to present the petition.\n\nIf seeking rain, request the descent of a certain general to bring rain, and await the imperial assent. If intending to pay homage at the Golden Palace, take leave of the True King and return directly to the Three Heavenly Gates. Declare the matter to the guardian officials as prescribed, recite the middle chapter, present the petition, and await the decree.\n\nOnce the Celestial Emperor has granted the imperial edict, summoning the Divine Empyrean, the True King is seen facing the palace to receive the Celestial Emperor’s mandate, dispatching thunder to bring rain. The True King, bearing the command, exits the Three Heavenly Gates. The practitioner follows the True King out, witnessing him summon the Three Marshals, Five Generals, and all Thunder Gods. The True King orally transmits the Celestial Emperor’s decree: “Due to prolonged drought in such-and-such a place, you, the Thunder Gods, are commanded to bring rain to relieve the drought.” Immediately, clouds gather, lightning flashes, thunder roars, and rain descends.\n\nWhen the rain is sufficient, the True King again pays homage at the Golden Palace to express gratitude before withdrawing. The Realized One likewise expresses gratitude and returns to the Crimson Palace, following the usual procedure. If not paying homage at the Golden Palace, the True King is still seen arriving at the Three Heavenly Gates to summon thunder and bring rain, after which the usual procedure is followed.\n\nThe heavens comprise Nine Empyreans, with the Divine Empyrean at the center. Its scenery is of azure cinnabar, turquoise, and purple jade. The Supreme Emperor resembles the Supreme Clarity’s form. The Thunder City lies at the southeast corner.\n\n*Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Twenty-Nine—Concluded*\n*Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Thirty*",

First, with black ink, write the bureau’s header at both ends of the document. Once all is prepared, invoke the marshal generals to act at the center. First, impress one seal to fix the position, then write the talisman above it, and seal it again. Below the bureau’s header, impress one seal; above the endorsement, impress another—arranged like the three points of a triangle. Then dry it over incense, burn paper money and horses with it, and dispatch the flying talisman to determine fortune or misfortune.\n\nWhen encountering flying heavenly or roaming earthly great demonic spirits, malevolent gods, evil ghosts, or demonic entities—mountain specters, sprites, and the like—harming the people, whose crimes warrant annihilation: first perform a jiao offering and memorial. Reward the generals lavishly, using twelve feet of yellow silk, cut to a square, to write the talisman. Further, take an iron brick, seven inches long, one foot wide, and half an inch thick. On its face, write \"By edict, execute\" and record the transgressions of the demonic entity, the official’s rank, name, and the date and time of the order. On the reverse, write the Jade Emperor’s name, the Four Saints’ names on either side, and the names of the Four Ding and Four Spirits below. On the talisman, add the Three Terraces, yin-yang, and the Dipper, then sink the brick at the site of the transgression. If on land, the iron brick is unnecessary—simply write on the yellow silk talisman and burn it with paper money.\n\nFor mid-level obstinate demonic entities, use a proclamation written on a talisman for the altar assembly, listing the Northern Emperor’s position after \"Your servant, receiving the decree, obeys.\"\n\nFor rain rituals, use an iron tablet inscribed with the talisman and cast it into a deep pool. For regular practice, use the standard form.\n\n**Standard Practice Procedure:**\nWhen performing the ritual, dispatch the talisman according to the form, then turn around and recite the incantation while casting the net.\n\n**Incantation:**\nBy the Northern Land’s edict, summon Luo [and] Tu Constellations.\nThe Ox-Ram Execution Seal sends qi flying through the void, the Rabbit Seal darkens heaven and earth.\nThe Dragon Seal dims sun and moon, the Jade Seal shatters evil on encounter.\nThe Rat Seal leaves no path in confusion, the Rat Seal locks swiftly in place.\nThe Tiger Seal commands mountains, rivers, seas, and winds, the Fire Seal urgently obeys the Northern Emperor’s edict and the Four Saints’ command.\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, form the Great Execution Seal with both hands, draw the northern qi, then cross the hands in the Dipper Seal—left hand for the yang Dipper, right hand for the yin Dipper—and release. Recite the Net-Casting Incantation while making the mudra.\n\n**Incantation:**\nBy the Northern Emperor’s edict, summon the east’s Thunder Rabbit Seal, the west’s Lake Rooster Seal, the south’s Fire Horse Seal, the north’s Water Rat Seal.\nThe Rat Seal opens the Heavenly Gate, the Pig Seal closes the Earthly Door.\nThe Wind Seal keeps the Human Gate, the Earth Seal blocks the Ghost Road.\nThe Mountain Seal above allows no wind to pass, the Rabbit Seal below permits no water to flow.\nThe Execution Seal slays demonic spirits—wind blades sever heads.\nPeople come without trace, ghosts come lost on the path.\n\nRespectfully invoke:\nThe east’s Jia-Yi Wood—one hundred thousand Heavenly Ding lock the Earth’s Axis (hook with the little finger).\nThe south’s Bing-Ding Fire—one hundred thousand Heavenly Ding descend in unison (hook with the ring finger).\nThe west’s Geng-Xin Metal—one hundred thousand Heavenly Ding all descend (hook with the middle finger).\nThe north’s Ren-Gui Water—one hundred thousand Heavenly Ding devour evil ghosts (hook with the index finger).\nThe center’s Wu-Ji Earth—one hundred thousand Heavenly Ding guard and protect (hook with the thumb).\n\n**Execute this with utmost urgency by the edict of the Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Great Emperor.**",

The *Northern Emperor* refers to the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the North Pole. The *Four Sages* are the four great marshals under the Northern Emperor’s command: Marshal Tianpeng, Marshal Tianyu, Marshal Xiangsheng, and Marshal Yousheng. *The Essence of Daoist Methods*, volumes 169 and 170, contains *The Great Method of Subduing Demons of the Four Sages of Huntian Feiti*, which belongs to the same tradition and may serve as a reference.\n\n---\n\n**Volume 33 of *Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls*: *The Lesser Four Sages’ Secret Method Before the Northern Emperor***\n\n**Lineage**\nThe ancestral master is Zhang the Perfected of the Great Cavern of Western Shu.\n\n**Generals**\nThe dedicated general for ritual protection is the Vast Spirit of Awesome Power, the Faceless Great General and Northern Pole Commander-in-Chief, Chen Sheng.\n\nHis face is black, his moon-like eyes gaze upward and are large and round, his teeth remain concealed, his hair is black and stands erect, and he wears a small green headscarf. He is clad in a black robe adorned with circular floral patterns on the shoulders, golden armor on the chest, and holds in his right hand an iron staff and in his left two iron staves. A dragon blade hangs at his side, and he wears a white sash, white trousers, and white gaiters.\n\nThis general is a transformation of the Dark Emperor, who manifested in the world during the late Qin and early Han dynasties. Indignant at the cruelty of the age and grieving over the suffering of the times, he resolved to save the people. Leading an army of a million, he commanded all who followed him, and the realm responded like clouds gathering and echoes resounding. His authority was well-regulated, his commands timely, and his purpose was to deliver and aid all living beings. Upon the fulfillment of his merit and deeds, during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, he revealed his traces and assisted in the celestial battles, earning merit. A temple was established for him, and he was enfeoffed as a general to harmonize and govern the common people.\n\nIn various ritual traditions, there is also a Faceless General. However, this general was known by Master Zhang of the Great Cavern, who understood his whereabouts and memorialized the Northern Pole, leading the troops to return to the altar. All who receive this method must revere and keep it secret; its efficacy will surely manifest. It must not be recklessly transmitted to unworthy persons.\n\nThis general communicates directly with the Northern Pole. For all prayers and petitions, the divine response is swift.\n\nThe next general is the Great General of Illuminating the Dao, Shedding Blood at the Head, and Assisting the Numinous, Hao Guang.\n\nHis face is red, his eyes round, his large teeth bared, and his red hair stands erect. He wears a small topknot, a half-black robe of a pale black hue, and golden armor on his chest. In his right hand, he wields a long blade, and in his left, he carries a ghost-headed sword. He wears a blood-red sash, a scabbard at his side, white trousers tucked up, and white gaiters.\n\nThis general is the spirit of the Mighty Celestial Guard. His nature is fierce and detests evil; he executes gods, kills demons, and metes out the harshest punishments. His divine power is resplendent, and he pursues mountain spirits, bringing them back to the true Dao. He transforms and guides the multitudes, and his merit is vast and profound.\n\nThis general also appears in other ritual traditions and is included in the registers of the Three and Five Capital Offices. However, in this altar tradition, he was transmitted by Master Zhang of the Great Cavern of Shu, who understood his essential principles and memorialized for his promotion.

His eyes gaze upward, his hands are clenched in fists crossed before him, and his entire body is clad in fine golden armor. He wears a helmet, a blade hangs at his waist, and a small golden sash binds his waist. His feet are bare. This general hails from the land of Chu. King Xian of Wei enfeoffed him as Grand Marshal of the Armies. His nature is upright and stern, detesting evil; he wields both authority and power, commands and subdues, and executes with decisive action. Skilled in leading troops into battle, he has rendered meritorious service time and again. King Xian issued an edict commanding him to lead the army, where he faced the Three-Battle Jiang Jie King of Wuya, dividing his forces to array in formation. Alone, he clapped his hands and charged into battle, yet suddenly, amidst the ranks, he perished in the fray, his qi spent. He vowed to return to the service of the Three Heavens’ Gate, becoming the Golden-Armored Valiant General. Later, Master Zhang of the Great Cavern memorialized his extraordinary valor, and he was appointed to lead troops under the altar’s banner.\n\nThe Manifestly Responsive, Demon-Subduing, Tiger-Headed Primordial Spirit Great General, Geng Wen, styled Zi Ze, wears a tiger crown. His face is half-red, his eyes white. He dons a black robe, holds a blade in his right hand, and lets a white gaiter hang down. His feet are bare, though sometimes he wears hempen sandals. This general is a man of the Tang dynasty. At the Purple Tenuity Grotto and Cloud Palace, he served as the Tiger-Attendant Spirit, originating from the northern lands, where he fed exclusively on termites. His nature is steadfast and gentle, yet when he presented a precious memorial, he was intercepted by a hundred demons. Stirring his courage, he raised his voice to summon the demon-subduing hosts. Thereupon, the Perfected Lord of Demon-Dispelling Celebration descended, leading a myriad of demon-subduing soldiers to serve under him. The demons were thus compelled to submit, and he achieved a minor merit. Unaware of his own resolve, within the Black Yin Zisi Temple, he brandished his blade and split several great beams, chewing through the termites within the wood without number. The temple’s monks entreated him to stay. Wherever the sound of the general’s voice reached within the temple’s halls, termites would take flight and fall dead to the ground.

Draw *qi* from the divine direction:\n*Jia-Yi* at *Chen*, *Bing-Ding* at *Mao*, *Wu-Ji* at *Zi*, *Geng-Xin* at *Shen*, *Ren-Gui* at *Wu*.\n\nThe two preceding secret talismans: whenever performing rituals, first inscribe these two talismans onto the memorial document and burn them. Then write two more talismans and burn them at the appointed time to hasten the dispatch of the documents. Place the two great spirit talismans beneath the altar. Invoke the talisman of Marshal Xin, immerse it in the water vessel, spray and sprinkle, and infuse the *qi* of the Celestial Stem into the water.\n\n**Inner Secret of the Heart-Method:**\nWhen performing the Jade Tone Thunder Summoning, employ the preceding method: circulate the fiery *qi* of wrath throughout the body, emanating from the crown to summon two generals. Combine with two generals from the *Xun* direction. Write talismans and recite incantations in a single breath, swiftly and with the force of thunder. Clap the command, shout the rebuke, and act upon the water in the vessel.\n\nFirst, invite the *qi* of fire and water into the vessel—fire first, then water—circulating the fire *qi* to transform it into water *qi*, merging water and fire. Next, infuse the *qi* of the Celestial Stem into the water, stirring it to absorb the water. Spray and sprinkle toward the direction where the thunder deities reside. Clap the command to summon, rebuke, and dispatch them to act. Inscribe talismans according to the day and direction, drawing *qi* to infuse them.\n\nIn this method, first let the fiery light burst forth from your own eyes, transforming into a sudden flame, then into Marshal Xin of Heaven in the void. Next, visualize yourself as Envoy Zhang, transmitting the Jade Emperor’s edict to issue commands. With your right hand, write the character *xu* (虚); with your left, write *zhang* (张). Visualize your wrath as fiery heat, cover your ears with both hands, uniting inner and outer forces so that water stirs and fire ignites.\n\nFirst, take two small sheets of blue paper, write *xu* and *zhang* on each, roll them into pellets, and insert the *xu* pellet into your left ear. Visualize black *qi* emerging from your right ear as rain. Clasp your hands in the thunder formation, grip firmly, gaze with wrathful *qi*, and strike once to issue the command. Use a black banner inscribed with the Northern Dipper, recite *Xin Zhi*, affix seven gold coins, and one great talismanic horse. Write the subsequent talisman on the horse, burn it, and recite the incantation. Open your eyes and mouth, marking them with cinnabar.\n\nThe master says: When the mind stirs, clouds and rain readily gather. One must practice restraint to preserve the spirit-*qi* in its entirety before proceeding. No memorial need be submitted; with a settled mind, the celestial *qi* clears, and clouds cannot coalesce.\n\n**Inner Work of the Mysterious Capital Thunder Hub:**\nEach night at the *Zi* hour, don robe and sit in stillness, banishing all thoughts. Click the teeth, close the eyes, concentrate the spirit, and inwardly visualize the five viscera as chambers of gold and jade. Click the teeth to gather saliva, fill the mouth, and swallow it into the cinnabar field. Swiftly lift the perineum. Repeat this three times nine, until the ninth repetition. Tightly contract the perineum without releasing, sensing the *qi* surge from the earth throughout the body, ascending to the muddy pellet. Visualize yourself as the Cinnabar Prime Lord, riding purple clouds to appear before the Emperor and present your petition. Upon receiving the decree, summon the cloud hosts to descend to the deep sea and draw water. Lift the perineum again, ascending along the spine to Kunlun, then slightly release the perineum. Once the response is received, proceed with the memorial and ritual.\n\n**Rain Response:**\nA sensation like insects crawling on the crown, moving to the forehead and itching—when the aperture itches, clouds and rain arrive. The body itches with steaming heat—thunder and rain approach. The forehead feels cool and damp with sweat—rain is imminent.\n\n**Thunder Response:**\nThe heart startles, the ears ring with thunderclaps, a faint sound lingers above the crown—thunder resounds. *Qi* surges with panting—thunder crashes.\n\n**Clear Weather Response:**\nBody and mind feel cool and clear—clear skies.

      "translated_text": "**The Great Year Martial Scroll Thunder Method**\n\nThe Principal Marshal of the Earth Bureau, the Great Year Spirit Yin Jiao: His name is Jiao. Crimson-bodied, blue-faced, green-skinned, with scorched yellow hair standing erect, atop his head a single skull, and eight skulls strung about his neck. He wears a leopard-skin loincloth. From his two eyes extend two hands: the right holds a golden bell, the left a seal. His middle pair of hands hold a yellow banner on the left and a leopard tail on the right. His lower pair of hands wield a halberd on the left and a fire-sword on the right. From the center of his brow streams a beam of golden light that pierces the beholder. Barefoot, his feet and entire body are wreathed in flying flames.\n\nVice-Marshal, Secondary Great General Hou Biao.\nBlack Path Five Ghosts Great Spirit Zhang Jin.\nBlack Path Annihilator of Households, Great Calamity Marshal Yu Wen.\nChanting Spirits Three Sha Great General Geng Tong.\nMemorial Clerk Secretary Xue Shen.\nErudite Great General Hao You.\nMighty Warrior, Ghost-Slaying Great General Zhao Yu.\nTen Evils Great Defeat General He Zhong.\nCarpenter’s Square Great Devourer, Ghost-Swallowing Great General Feng Meng.\nSoul-Snatching, Spirit-Seizing Great General Luo Shiwen.\nPraising Spirits, Subduing Spirits Great General Xie Feilian.\nCrimson Ledger Illuminating Path, Crimson Casket Great Spirit Qin Zao.\nGreen Ox Golden Dog Great General Lu De.\nGreen Dragon Great Spirit Ma Wen.\nWhite Tiger Great Spirit Chen You.\nVermilion Sparrow Great Spirit Feng Kui.\nDark Warrior Great Spirit Tang Kai.\nYellow Banner Great General Wang De.\nLeopard Tail Great General Ding Sheng.\nDisease Talisman Great General Ma Chong.\nFuneral Chariot Li You.\nShentu Xu Songgao.\nYulei Sang Boyuan.\nYellow Battle-Axe Great General Guan Sa.\nEastern Great General Jin Wenzheng.\nSouthern Great General Du Ji.\nWestern Great General Ji Shao.\nNorthern Great General Wu Zhengda.\nCentral Great General Li Hui.\nSeventy-Two Seasonal Nodes Great General Song Xingwen.\nTwenty-Four Qi Great General Han Bao.\nSwift Seizer Great General Jiang Xiu.\nHuman Spirit Spirit Lords, Malevolent Spirits, Ferocious Sha, and all spirit officials.\n\n**Refining and Summoning the Marshal**\nWhen refining the Marshal, first compose the spirit and settle the will. Visualize the Yellow Court—the Central Palace—where a distinct clod of yellow earth appears. Tilt the head back, draw the yellow qi of the Central Heaven into the heart through the nose. The heart’s fire ascends to meet it, then is pressed downward by the external yellow qi into the Central Palace. The internal yellow qi rises to meet the fire, generating it. The three qi merge, all becoming yellow qi. Gather and exhale it upward through the mouth, sending it to the Central Heaven, where it coalesces and descends. Inhale it through the nose into the Central Palace.\n\nAgain, mobilize this mass of golden-yellow qi, exhale it forcefully to the earth, dispersing it to fill the cosmos. All persons, self, and things vanish, leaving only thick, abundant yellow qi. With the right hand form the Sword Mudra at the waist, and with the left hand circulate the Thunder Mechanism through the kidneys. Thunder surges from the spine to the ears, cleaving the yellow qi. Flying fire bursts forth, revealing the Marshal within. The adept turns slightly, inhales, and draws the beam of light from the Marshal’s brow into the Cinnabar Field, passing through the coccyx. It merges with the golden light between the two kidneys, then surges up the spine to the Mud Pill, where it transforms into golden light. The adept inhales this golden light through the nose and exhales it to envelop the Marshal.\n\nWhen deploying the Marshal to execute intentions or inscribe talismans, if the refinement is habitual, condense the golden light into a pellet, gradually shrinking it to the size of a star. Inhale it through the nose into the Central Palace. When needed, extract and employ it.\n\n**Summoning Incantation**\nReverently summon the Fierce Marshal of the Year Lord: at the call, hasten to arrive—swift as shooting stars, rapid as wind and thunder. Dispelling clouds, seizing lightning, hurling fire and meteors, the yellow banner leads, the leopard tail follows. The seventy-two seasonal nodes, the twenty-four qi, the twelve prohibitions—malevolent sha take the fore. Encountering demons, sever them by the inch; meeting ghosts, obliterate their forms. Ahead, dispel the Nine Uglies; behind, annihilate mountain sprites. Flying dragons, earthly anomalies—subdue and pacify the Star of Literary Brilliance. I now summon and invoke you: descend with utmost urgency. Defy the Emperor’s command, and be extinguished by wind and fire.\n\nReverently summon the Fierce Official of the Earth Bureau, Yin Jiao: hasten to arrive, by the August Emperor’s statutes and decrees.\n\nClasp the Jade Mudra and silently recite:\n*By the Heavenly Talisman, the Star Maid’s Decree of Slaying and Seizing.*\n\nAfter the incantation, visualize the Marshal’s arrival. Proceed according to the matter at hand, then inscribe the talisman.\n\n**Talisman-Pen Incantation**\nIssuing from the Central Ancestor,\nWu and Ji transform into earth.\nAll spirits submit in reverence,\nA hundred evils dare not gaze.\nThe Nine Luminaries conceal my body,\nThe Five Emperors govern the stars’ numbers.\nThe Yellow River flows backward,\nThe Five Peaks crumble and collapse.\nGreat forests are all uprooted,\nIn the three springs, leaves wither yellow.\nI lodge within the Dipper and Ox,\nTen thousand, ten thousand demonic essences flee.\nThe Earth God protects my rectitude,\nFiery light gathers dead ashes.\nShould I but grow angry,\nOpen my eyes and look again.\nLocked onto the Central Palace,\nAll things must hide.\nThe Divine Seal shines universally,\nAll evils perish with the seal,\nTransforming utterly into congealed blood.\nSwiftly, swiftly, by the Central Palace’s Great Sage Earth Star’s decree of slaying and seizing.\n\n**Threefold Talisman, Clasp the Jade Mudra**\nBy the Central Palace’s Earth Star decree:\nYin Jiao, hasten to arrive.\nAll spirits receive the command—\nSlay ghosts, devour demons.\nDare to resist, and slay ghosts without end.\nYear Lord, Earth Slayer—fire-hastily obey!\nBy the Heavenly Talisman, the Star Maid’s decree of slaying and seizing.\nVisualize the Marshal entering.\nThe Earth Bureau’s Great Marshal: execute the command, proceed as intended, act with utmost speed.\n\n*Oṃ ra tian da huo guang tuo luo ni, by this dhāraṇī’s decree, seize!*\nClasp the Slaying Mudra, draw the qi of the Dipper’s stem into [the talisman].\nAfterward, add this decree, reciting:\n*I act by the Jade Clarity August Emperor’s decree, the Highest Clarity August Emperor’s decree, the Grand Clarity Great Emperor’s decree.*\nThen recite: *Oṃ du lu di sa pō hē.*\nAdd the three characters *hòng lìng jīng*, then visualize the spleen’s qi ascending to the Mud Pill, transforming into the Central Palace’s Earth Star, within which lies a golden *wù* (兀) character. Guide the spleen’s metal qi into the talisman.\n\n**Talisman Incantation**\nMystery of Heaven and Earth,\nRoot of the ten thousand qi.\nVast cultivation through myriad kalpas,\nAttests to my divine penetration.\nWithin and beyond the Three Realms,\nOnly I am uniquely revered.\nAtop my head, golden light\nShines and reflects upon my body.\nSeen yet unseen,\nHeard yet unheard.\nEncompassing Heaven and Earth,\nNurturing the multitude of beings.\nUpholding it ten thousand times,\nMy body radiates light.\nThe Three Realms guard and protect,\nThe Five Emperors receive and welcome.\nMyriad spirits bow in homage,\nCommanding thunder and lightning.\nGhosts and demons lose their courage,\nSpirits and anomalies vanish in form.",

Press it down into the Cinnabar Field and guard it.\n\n**Summoning and Attachment Formula**\nFor operational use, first form the Thunder Bureau with both hands, rub the Kidney Hall, and mobilize thunder to stir the *qi*, rising from either side of the navel like thunder’s roar.\nThe inner pearl of the Cinnabar Field ascends above the navel, revolving like a golden thread piercing the Posterior Heaven. The aperture within the kidneys—this pearl transforms into a golden light, a threefold entity within, leaping and glowing as if about to take flight. From the *Jiāchūn* point, it enters and ascends straight to the Wind Palace, then bursts forth from both eyes as golden light into the incense smoke, resembling a butterfly’s dance.\nThe adept’s gaze, left-turning and right-shifting, fixes clearly upon it.\nNext, take a copper coin, fan, or paper money, clasp it in hand, and envelop it with this *qi*. Transfer it to the spirit-medium’s hands, seeing the threefold entity enter through the medium’s ears, eyes, mouth, and nose.\nRecite the preceding incantations, then use the Thunder Bureau to trace the medium’s face. Blow a mouthful of Northern *qi* upon them. When the medium’s hands grow numb and paralyzed, seize the object from their grasp. Pass it once over the medium’s palm, then recite the Black Wind Incantation, visualizing it entering water.\nWith the left hand forming the Malevolence Talisman and the right the Sword Mudra, inscribe the Nine Characters in the air, swiftly reversing their order. Urgently recite the Roaring Incantation and the Iterative Character Incantation, drawing Northern *qi* to blow into the water. Dip the brush and write, visualizing black water churning, black *qi* billowing.\nNext, lift the medium’s hands, baring their chest. The adept draws Northern *qi* and blows it beneath the medium’s feet, visualizing black *qi* rising in dense swirls to the waist. With the right hand’s Sword Mudra, part the medium’s face. Spray a mouthful of water, issue a command, and shout to the attending officers: bind them in black mist—a small infant appears at the top of the Cinnabar Field within.\nReunite them, visualizing the medium transformed into a ghostly form. If the spirit attaches, command the officers to administer ten lashes, then bind them with crossed restraints. Shout and roar distinctly, interrogating at will.\nTo awaken the soul, recite the *Yóu dǒu* incantation for soul-entry, the Sevenfold Veiling, and spray a mouthful of water. Visualize the ghostly form reverting to the medium’s original appearance. The adept’s left hand forms the Thunder Bureau, circling the medium’s Cinnabar Field seven times, while the right hand’s Sword Mudra rends upward from the Cinnabar Field. Visualize a thunderous roar in the medium’s heart, driving forth a golden orb. The adept inhales from the Cinnabar Field, and the medium’s crown awakens at once.\n\n**The Thirty-Sixth Scroll of *Dharma Pearls from the Ocean of Methods* Concludes**\n*Divine Empyrean Capital Commissioner, Golden Wheel Enforcer Marshal Zhào’s Talismanic Methods: Transmitted by the Orthodox Unity Tradition.*",

A native of Mount Zhōngnán, he withdrew into the mountains during the Qín era to cultivate the supreme Dao. Upon perfecting his merit and conduct, he was summoned by the Jade Emperor’s decree to serve as Vice Marshal of the Divine Empyrean, assuming the offices of Direct Palace General, North Polar Attending Censor, and Supreme Commissioner of Imperial Mandates. Empowered to command the Three Realms, patrol the Five Directions, and oversee the Nine Provinces, he later received another edict to guard the Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar during the Han Ancestral Celestial Master’s refinement of the Great Elixir.\n\nHis powers encompass driving thunder and dispatching lightning, summoning rain and calling winds, eradicating pestilence and severing malevolence, healing illness and averting calamity—none greater than the Marshal’s efficacy.\n\nThe following texts, collected in Scrolls 133, 240, and others of the same compendium—*Secret Methods of Mysterious Altar Marshal Zhào*, *Orthodox Unity Dragon-Tiger Mysterious Altar Golden Wheel Enforcer As-You-Will Secret Methods*, *Orthodox Unity Flying Tiger Supervisor Marshal Zhào’s Secret Methods*, *Orthodox Unity Dragon-Tiger Mysterious Altar Great Method*, *Mysterious Altar As-You-Will Great Method*, *Highest Clarity Harmonious Wonder Dao Illuminating Primordial Five-Thunder Mysterious Altar Great Method*, and *Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar Marshal’s Six Yin Wild-Sleeve Dance Thunder Method*—all belong to the same lineage and may serve as corroborative references.\n\n**The Heavenly Three Wind-Fire Lone Thunder Great Method**: Transmitted by the Orthodox Unity Tradition, this also derives from the lineage of Marshal Zhào Gōngmíng.\n\n**Secret Methods of Thunder, Lightning, and Earth Deities**: Transmitted by the Orthodox Unity Tradition.

His visage is deep date-red, with large phoenix eyes and sparse whiskers. He wears an iron fish-tail crown, a black headscarf, and black wide-sleeved robes, with yellow cuff guards tied at the sleeves and a yellow sash cinching his waist. His white silk trousers are bound at the ankles, and he wears black shoes, gripping his wrists while carrying a short-handled iron mallet. A black tiger attends his side, and reverse flames coil downward from his waist, encircling his body as he rides upon golden flames and fiery clouds. Under his command are the Six Dīng and Six Jiǎ, the Five Thunders, the Eight Malevolents, and legions of celestial soldiers.\n\n**Internal Alchemy:** When the ritual master performs the rites, they must first purify with wine and burn incense to invoke the divine presence. Assuming the *shàngzhí* stance, they form the *shà* mudra with the left hand and the sword mudra with the right, standing in the *dīng* position. They first recite the *Tàiyīn Huàshēng Zhòu* or the *Běifāng Xuántiān Zhòu*. They visualize within their *níwán* palace a radiant golden character *nì*, shining with luminous clarity. Next, they press the Thunder Formation firmly upon their heart, imagining the heart’s fire descending in reverse to the space between the two kidneys, stirring the primordial *qi* to surge upward. They then visualize within the heart an Upper Perfected One. Following this, they transform the primordial *qi* into crimson fiery *qi*, which ascends to the *níwán* palace, merging with the golden character to burst forth and ascend directly to the northern heavens. There, they behold the Marshal descending upon this fiery light into the void. The ritual master then briefly directs their gaze toward the *gèn* direction behind their elbow, where the earth splits open, and a black tiger emerges from the black mist. The master immediately forms the *yín* mudra and shouts the syllable *duō!*—whereupon the tiger prostrates itself before the right side of the altar. Seeing the tiger submit, the Great Marshal descends from the void and, accompanied by the tiger, awaits commands.\n\n**Summoning Incantation:**\n*\"Black Tiger Great Spirit of Mount Wǔdāng,\nThunder roars to seize demonic spirits.\nLeading three hundred thousand celestial soldiers,\nThe Dark Mist of the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor surges forth,\nMighty and fierce, manifesting divine power.\nSix Dīng, Six Jiǎ, Eight Malevolent Generals—\nLiú Wénxiǎn, hasten swiftly to the altar!\nGreat Spirit, Great Spirit, come with speed!\nBy the decree of the Teaching King, the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor!\"*\n\nFor writing, anointing, consecrating, or dispatching talismans, use the preceding incantation.

In former times, during the first year of Yongshou in the Han dynasty, the Celestial Master convened at Lutang with the Year-General and the Lady of Great Yin, swearing an oath upon split stone that they would not imprison the people of the world, disrupt their dwellings, or bring forth calamities.\n\nNow, as reported, the petitioner’s household, on such-and-such a day, undertook construction without discerning the positions of yin and yang, nor the directions governed by spirits and malevolent forces. Fearing transgression against the Year’s Slayer, the Monthly Punishment, the Hour’s Inauspiciousness, or the Day’s Ominous Portents—thereby secretly offending the Earth Treasury and provoking the Spirit Bureau—disasters and afflictions have arisen in rapid succession, with illnesses compounding and the heart gripped by terror, leaving no peace day or night. The petitioner humbly beseeches relief and resolution.\n\nThis Bureau, acting on Heaven’s behalf to transform and succor all beings, cannot refuse such a plea. Having already provided talismanic water for the afflicted to ingest and wear, and talismans to post upon gates and courtyards, we now issue this special decree.\n\nUpon receipt, urgently comply with the Celestial Master’s teachings and admonitions, notifying:\nEarth Lord Chén Yàxiān,\nYè Zǐliáng,\nZhāng Zǐguī,\nFire-Blood Hé Míngbó,\nand the Six Jiǎ’s life-destiny spirits: Lín Jìngzōng,\nOfficial Talisman Lǐ Míngzhāng,\nDeath Talisman Xiè Qiáng,\nIllness Talisman Hào Zìcóng,\nNine Virtue Star Malevolent Forces,\nMetal Spirit Seven Malevolent Forces,\nYear’s Three Malevolent Forces,\nYellow Banner, Leopard Tail, Year-General,\nOx-Yellow, Horse-Yellow,\nMale and Female Body-Yellow,\nGreat and Lesser Yin-Yang,\nMonthly Establishment’s Earth Subordinate Two Thousand Stone Spirits,\nThree Hundred Sixty Great Malevolent Forces,\nOne Hundred Twenty Lesser Malevolent Forces,\nFuneral Gate, Mourning Visitors,\nMale and Female Pestilential Malevolent Forces,\nand all evil spirits and malevolent forces.\n\nBy the Primordial One’s talismanic mandate, command them all to swiftly depart from the forbidden direction, ceasing their ancient obstinacy and desisting from wanton harm.

Draw pure qi through the nose and lift the \"Golden Well.\" Inhale one breath of pure qi into the Cinnabar Field, envisioning oneself as the Master—crimson-haired, indigo-bodied, clad in black robes, or bare, seated in the Nine Uglies posture, a skull crowning the head, enveloped in a shroud of black mist.\n\nNext, visualize the red and black qi of the two kidneys intertwining to form a golden talisman at the center, flanked by two generals on the left and right, with the Great General before and behind. Gently sway the paired passes of the spine, circulating the qi upward to the Mud Pill Palace. The Mystic Pearl emerges from the Kunlun summit. Envision the talisman ascending from the crown, the two generals emerging from the left and right eyes, while the remaining six generals issue from the other orifices to stand before the altar.\n\nInternally apply the method in Crane Posture: first exhale the turbid qi from the mouth, dispersing it to the northeast, where it transforms into Mount Fengdu, beneath which lie six caverns encircled by seawater. Then cross hands at the flanks in the Execution Mudra, visualizing nine coiled serpents writhing before the adept. Envision the adept seated upon the serpents, eyes closed, perceiving a bright moon within the heart illuminating the kidneys below. As the kidney water and heart moon merge in radiance, the inner landscape unfolds—within the Fengdu Palace, azure and white qi intermingle, predominantly azure with traces of black. The Mystic Qi ascends from the spine to the crown, transmuting into the Eight Generals, who emerge from the adept’s eyes, ears, mouth, and nose to stand above.\n\nNext, cross hands and press the legs, visualizing the qi of the Bubbling Springs—white on the left, black on the right—issuing from the Shoulder Wells to manifest Jiao and Zeng at the ears, flanking the left and right shoulders. When the adept opens their eyes, their body has transformed into the Perfected Lord Wei, coiled atop the nine serpents. Silently recite the incantation seven times, envisioning the external landscape of Fengdu’s generals converging from the execution qi. The adept swiftly forms the Sword Mudra with both hands, sweeping downward to gather the generals into one, arraying them before the altar. With focused intent, command and dispatch them to their tasks.\n\n**Secret Incantation:**\n*\"By the decree of the Dark Netherlord, the Numinous Officer, Perfected Lord Wei.\nJiao and Zeng, Water and Fire, emerge from the Yang Ford.\nAbove, they bear the Emperor’s mandate; below, they succor ghostly souls.\nO Black Spirits, Black Saints, malevolent ghosts and wicked sprites—\nAerial curses, earthly rebels—\nDispatch the Ox-Head Officers, summon the Yaksha deities.\nWhether distant or near, whether old or new,\nNilu blazes with Fire, Zi-Wu channels Metal with Mo.\nWu-Wei whistles with Wind, Wei-Si hisses with Water.\nSi-Zi, the Yin-Yang Generals and Officers—\nWhen Zi passes Xu, the Sword Mudra is formed, sweeping them downward.\nSeize and deliver them to the Dark Nether, swiftly as the Yaksha’s heart-seizing writ!\"*\n\nSeven repetitions.\n**General Talisman Record.**",

First, he summons Attendant Zhang and entrusts him with the task of summoning the Six-One spirits. After burning Attendant Zhang’s talisman, he then summons the Six *Ding* Messengers according to the method, silently reciting the *Om-Om Han-Han* incantation as he burns each of the six talismans, calling their names one by one. The ritual proceeds in order, following the prescribed offerings.\n\nUpon completion, bury the paper ashes, tea, wine, and offerings in the *Xun* direction, marking the spot with the sword.

      "translated_text": "Now, in accordance with proper ritual procedure, I humbly present this petition. On the [day] of the [month], during the hours of *xu* and *hai*, I shall prepare incense of sincerity and talismans of faith to invoke the presence of the Central Palace’s Yellow Thearch, the Lord of Destiny Who Oversees the Kitchen Hearth, as well as the Jade Immortals, the Radiant and Heroic Youths, and the Revered Maidens of Alchemy. I beseech you to heed the talismanic command of the Most High, hasten to this altar, expound the Daoist teachings, and swiftly bestow your divine decree, responding to prayers and manifestations as they arise. This petition is hereby formally submitted.\n\nTo the Central Palace’s Yellow Thearch, the Lord of Destiny Who Oversees the Kitchen Hearth, and the Jade Immortals, the Radiant and Heroic Youths, and the Revered Maidens of Alchemy:\nUpon receipt of this petition, may you descend by the cinnabar ladder and immediately grant your decree in accordance with its contents.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\nOn the [day] of the [month] of the [year], at the hour of [time].\n[Rank and Name] affixed.\nOrthodox Register of the Dipper Palace’s Upholding Sageliness, Preserver of Virtue, True Lord, Who Governs the Teaching of the Great Mystery and the Immortal Sages.\n\n**The Great Rite of Destiny Petition and Disaster Aversion**\n**Celestial Petition to the Dipper**\n\nThis method originated in Western Shu and is not commonly known in the world. Later, the Nine Radiant Immortals of the Zhangren Abbey in Chengdu transmitted it to the Xianzhen Abbey on Shaoshi Mountain in Jiangxi, where it spread among the people. Master passed it to disciple by oral transmission, a method for urgent petitions to the Dipper, unknown to the secular world.\n\nThe master said: The sins and blessings of humanity are all reported to the celestial authorities. In Heaven, they are governed by the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, who oversee human destiny. In the world, this office is held by the Hearth Lord. Moreover, the Lord of Destiny is the chief of the Six Spirits and the manifested agent of the Seven Primes within the Dipper. This deity records the actions of humanity, whether upright or deceitful, and on the last day of each month, ascends to Heaven to submit a complete report. Major transgressions result in the loss of life or the severing of one’s lineage, while minor offenses bring misfortune upon the self. How could one escape?\n\nIn recent times, wealthy households and noble officials, when encountering inauspicious years and suffering calamities, have sought Daoist masters and shamans to perform rites of petition and aversion. Some offer prayers to the stars, others hold grand jiao rituals, expending wealth to purchase offerings and mobilizing servants for preparations. Yet they exert no personal effort, merely providing their presence to bear witness. Among them, some fail to abstain from meat, act carelessly, or even laugh irreverently. How can they expect their prayers to be answered?\n\nThe masters of old were cultivated persons of high virtue, simple and sincere, yet their methods were inflexible. Thus, the grace of the Most High—who opens the path to deliverance and aids the living—could not be widely extended or equally bestowed, failing to universally benefit all beings. In this way, the advantage lay with the rich, not the poor. By worldly standards, those of modest means, when struck by disaster, lack the vast resources to perform such rites and can only await death helplessly—how pitiful!\n\nThe Most High cherishes all life and values contentment, whether noble or base, high or low. Yet the *Mysterious Numinous* scripture states: For the poor and lowly, who lack the means to perform grand rituals, even offering a cup of water or a single flower is dismissed as empty pretense. This is due to the world’s mediocre masters and vulgar practitioners, who refuse to humble themselves, seek teachers, or inquire into the Dao. They concern themselves only with attire, voice, and ornate implements, creating an illusion of beauty. Their practices are mere plagiarism and fabrication, deceiving later students.\n\nIn recent times, the *Mysterious Numinous* method of silent petition and the secret rites of the *River Chart* have circulated. Some obtain a few talismanic commands from its texts or memorize a few lines of esoteric incantations, yet they understand nothing of their depth. They deceive households and delude the celestial perfected, performing nothing more than lighting lamps, burning paper, and reciting dedications. The master said: If the Lord of Destiny can report humanity’s sins and blessings to Heaven, then I shall entrust this secret method to him, conveying these sentiments to the stellar heavens and petitioning on their behalf to avert disasters. The response shall be swift as shooting stars.\n\nIn my travels among the masters, I encountered a person of high attainment who transmitted to me the *Elbow-Pocket Petition to the Dipper* and other oral secrets. I have since devoted myself to its practice and repeatedly witnessed its numinous efficacy. The cost is minimal, yet its responses are timely. Regardless of gender, those facing peril should first observe three days of purification and abstinence, then perform the method with focused intention. There is no instance where the deities do not respond. The key lies in sincerity—do not harbor disrespect or act recklessly. To violate the celestial statutes is no small matter; Heaven will surely know, and disaster will follow swiftly, leaving no room for prayer.\n\nNow, in strict accordance with my master’s transmission, I set forth these instructions. For all scholars who approach this with reverence, single-minded devotion, and respectful observance, acting as Heaven’s proxy to transform and save beings, the merit is vast and beyond description. Take heed and do not neglect this.\n\n**Sequence of Practice**\nFor all practices, one must first purify body and mind through abstinence and bathing, dispelling all distracting thoughts. Each morning, burn incense, face north, sit in silent meditation for a short while, and recite the scriptures with utmost sincerity before inscribing the talismans.\n\n**Altar-Transforming Talisman**\nThis talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper, seven inches in length and three inches in width. Hold the paper in the left hand while forming the *sha* mudra, draw in the northern *qi*, and write \"Chen Renyong enters the talisman.\" Visualize the Five Numinous Officials of the Dipper’s mouth descending, and seal it with the Golden Edict character.\n\n**Talisman-Inscribing Incantation**\nThe Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper,\nGreat deities of the celestial center.\nAbove, they attend the Golden Palace;\nBelow, they cover Mount Kunlun.\nThey regulate the cosmic order,\nGoverning Heaven and Earth.\nGreat Kui, Greedy Wolf,\nGiant Gate, Wealth Repository,\nLiterary Brilliance, Integrity and Chastity,\nMartial Brilliance, Breaker of Armies.\nThey encompass the great celestial realm,\nPenetrating even the finest dust.\nWhat disaster cannot be eradicated?\nWhat blessing cannot be attained?\nThe primordial *qi* of the August Sovereign\nComes to merge with my body.\nWherever the Celestial Pivot points,\nIt revolves day and night without cease.\nThough I am a humble person,\nI seek the Dao and yearn for the numinous.\nMay I always behold your august presence\nAnd wish to preserve long life.\nThe Highest Jade Thearch,\nThe Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord.\nHasten, as the law commands!\n\n**Purification Talisman**\nThis talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper. First recite the *Purification of Heaven and Earth Incantation*, then draw in the northern *qi* to infuse the talisman.\n\n**Incantation of the Great Dipper Deities**\nThe Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper,\nWhose *qi* governs the heavens.\nThe Great Sage of the Celestial Pivot,\nWhose majestic radiance is boundless.\nAbove Heaven and below Earth,\nThey sever the roots of all evil.",
      "overlap_context": "ke earnest supplications, I beseech responsive efficacy. Should I fail in this duty, I submit myself to the Upholding Sageliness True Lord’s sole adjudication, that my transgressions be made manifest and my errors reproved—this is no deliberate act of mine.

diagrams,\nHarmonize and transform creation,\nBalance and regulate yin and yang,\nSever and cast down demonic stars,\nVerify talismans and observe correspondences.\n\nFor example, the *Liúhuǒ*

slayer.\nWhen the talismanic mandate of the *Liúhuǒ* baleful star offends the *Jīnhǔ*,\nIt responds through the black slayer of thunder and rain.\nThis star pertains to metal, that talisman to fire—\nThe principle of fire overcoming metal.\n\nThe gods of *Fāntiān Fùdì*\nAre to be met with the flying-sword talisman for severing corpses.\nTo offend them is to slay and subdue the thunder master’s family.\nCover and shield with the Heavenly Emperor’s command,\nOr the ritual master will suffer the calamity.\nMoreover, on *jiǎ-sì* days,\nWhen the dragon soars and the rooster crows at

thunder-slayer,\nAnd shoot it with the thunder arrow—this is critical.\nEach arrow has its own method of activation and diagram.\n\n**Procedures for Mobilization**\nFor example, if the response is due on a certain day,\nThe day prior, seek the direction of the *Liúhuǒ* White Tiger.\nThen summon with the master’s own talisman.\nUpon arrival, visualize each spirit’s attire and colors,\nOffer tea, and state the purpose.\n\nNext, circulate the Nine Qi and blow upon the blade,\nSlaughter the chicken with the right hand holding the knife,\nThe left hand cutting, dripping blood into the wine vessel *bǐng*.\nPlace the chicken in the baleful direction.\nAgain, circulate the Nine Qi into the wine,\nSpray the chicken toward the *Liúhuǒ* White Tiger’s direction,\nAnd command: *Liúhuǒ* White Tiger,\nAt such-and-such day and hour, manifest the great response!\n\nPrepare four documents:\nInscribe the Jade Emperor’s decree,\nFire Earl’s talisman,\nThunder character talisman,\nNine Qi talisman—\nFour talismanic mandates, divided into eight pieces.\nFour pieces affixed to the front of the documents,\nThe remaining four reserved for summoning the generals at the altar.\n\nFor the document to the altar’s official generals,\nUse one Fire Earl’s talisman, divided into two pieces,\nApplied as before.\nInscribe notes on the reverse for efficacy.\nThen, facing the direction of the direct talisman, burn it,\nSummon the direct talisman, and present the memorial text,\nSubmitting it to the respective offices.\n\nAlso prepare a Grand Year document,\nCommanding the leadership of this year’s flourishing qi,\nWhite Tiger, *Liúhuǒ* official talismans,\nSword, Vermilion Bird, and the Four Thunder Arrows,\nTo arise in such-and-such direction,\nRaising clouds and spitting mist,\nGreatly shaking the thunderous sound.\nWhen the matter is complete and the merit accomplished,\nDo not forget to report and requite.\n\nAffix a complete Grand Year talisman to the front of the document,\nBurn it toward the Grand Year’s direction.\nAt the appointed hour, observe the White Tiger’s direction for activation.\nReturn to pacify and circulate the scriptures.\nAt dawn, observe whether qi is present.\nPrepare four recall-slayer talismans,\nSecretly burn them together in the incense burner—\nThe response will surely be great.\n\nIf the qi is black and the slayer’s arrival fierce,\nHastily burn the resolution talisman in the burner.\nAfter a moment, transform it into a sudden fire,\nPress the thunder talisman, and urge the thunder and rain unceasingly.\n\nFor *liù-yǐ* mobilizations,\nPrepare a summons the day prior, and burn it at the appointed time.\nIf unresponsive, next use the *xīn* talisman to urge the summons,\nThen the *dèng* talisman to urge the summons.",

      "translated_text": "*The Purple Palace Mysterious Writ*\n\nIt is said that of all afflictions that plague human breath, none is more grievous than consumptive wasting. No physician or shaman in the world can cure it. Once one person falls ill, the malady spreads through the entire clan, even to the point of extinguishing the family line. None dare approach, hence it is called \"corpse-transmitted consumption.\" Some burn the dead in the mountains and wilds; others cast them into rivers, refusing burial. Descendants sever ties of bone and flesh; husbands and wives lose the bond of mutual regard. How tragic indeed!\n\nThose who treat this illness fail to suppress the Three Corpses and Nine Worms. Talismans prove ineffective—how could mere physicians or shamans succeed? Now, a treasured secret is revealed, to be imparted only to those deemed worthy, transmitted through the heart. If one whose nature and conduct are not gentle and sincere obtains this text without the master’s guidance, recklessly practices it, or carelessly divulges it, the calamity will extend to nine generations—an unforgivable sin. Beware, beware!\n\nHouseholds afflicted by this malady must submit a written petition to the altar, declaring their life’s origin and detailing when the illness began and its present symptoms. If they experience inauspicious nightmares or see ghosts of deceased kin, they must clearly describe these omens. Upon verification of the worms’ presence through talismanic fumigation, a memorial is submitted to the Celestial Emperor and the Ancestral Master, dispatching generals to seize the corpse-transmitting ghosts and the wrongfully deceased kin. After imprisonment and interrogation, talismans are issued to expel the corpse-worms.\n\nAfter ingesting the talisman, within twenty-one days the disease’s source is expelled. If the body sweats and itches as though worms crawl beneath the skin, swiftly wipe the entire body with cloth and burn it. Some may vomit worm-like forms; others may experience abdominal rumbling and pain, followed by diarrhea. The talisman’s power, infused with thunder-fire and lethal qi, incinerates the corpse-worms, leaving no chance of escape. The worms vary in form, but once the disease’s source is expelled, place them in a vessel and cast it into flowing water.\n\nThen, administer the *Report-and-Response Talisman* to determine which organ is depleted, and use the *Tonifying Talisman* to restore what was damaged. For those with qi and blood stagnation, it is also essential to cultivate a calm mind and nurture their nature, avoiding overexertion. The method requires eighty days of treatment, and after a thousand days, the body is purged—such a person is reborn into the world. If they fail to abstain from the bedchamber or regulate their activities appropriately, survival remains uncertain. The utmost care must be taken, as with a woman in childbirth. Without proper nurturing, if the illness recurs, the danger is grave.\n\nTransmitted by Yan Daolong, styled Zilong, of the Tianpeng lineage.\n\nThe method for pursuing and eradicating consumption is indeed the most secret text of Heaven and a rare treasure in the world below. Yet today’s practitioners, without examining the root, merely grasp at the branches, vainly attempting to practice it. I first studied under Master Wu Youkai, who received the transmission from Guo Jundaguan. Guo’s master was Chen Zangxiu, whose master was Guo Jun Huangxi, a disciple of Fan Xuan. Though I obtained this transmission, I remained uncertain whether the root and branches were complete.\n\nMy neighbor, Master Xueya, received the lineage from Fan Xuan. Having traversed rivers and lakes, he was a pioneer in this art, reviving the dead and saving lives beyond count. In his later years, he returned home, and I became his disciple. How rare is such a text! I served my master for years, fulfilling the duties of a disciple, even providing his burial shroud and coffin. Fan Xuan, pleased with my devotion, imparted all the profound mysteries of the methods.\n\nFor over forty years, I wandered rivers and lakes, and the efficacy of my master’s teachings was as responsive as an echo. Though many sought the Dao, few were deemed worthy of transmission. As the saying goes: \"Disciples seek masters easily, but masters seek disciples with difficulty.\" This is no idle claim.\n\nMoreover, today’s practitioners often corrupt talismans and incantations, rendering them flawed and erroneous. When applied to healing, no response is received. Is the method itself inefficacious? No—it is the failure of transmission. At seventy, I met you, who have studied diligently and whose aspirations are admirable. I shall fully transmit the master’s teachings to propagate the true doctrine.\n\nTo future learners: unless you offer gold and treasures, pledge your devotion, and swear before Heaven and Earth, do not lightly divulge this. This is my wish and the fortune of the method. I, Yuanchang, have faithfully upheld my master’s transmission, and its efficacy in practice has long been known. Thus, I compile this volume as a treasured inheritance for saving the world. Should later scholars obtain this text, cherish and practice it, and the ranks of immortals may be attained. To carelessly divulge or profane it invites severe retribution from the Mysterious Tribunal. May the generals and officials of the Ancestral Master bear witness.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Zhang Yuanchang, fourth-generation descendant of the Tianpeng lineage.\n\n*The Origins of the Tianpeng Lineage*\n\nLong ago, the lineage’s founder, Master Pinlefeng, suffered from consumption. In a dream, a divine being said: \"Seek the true immortals of Mount Hua, and your illness may be cured.\" The master ascended the mountain and resided there for over two months, but his condition worsened. The mountain’s Daoists, fearing his death, refused him lodging. Leaning on his staff, he descended, and halfway down the slope, exhausted, he sat. Suddenly, three Daoists appeared and asked: \"Why are you here?\" The master explained his plight. The Daoists replied: \"Return to the mountain. I have a prescription beneath the seat of the Perfected Wang. Seek Lu Yanghao, and memorialize your illness—it will soon be cured.\" With that, they vanished.\n\nThe master marveled and returned to the mountain. Beneath the seat of the Perfected Wang, he indeed found the text. Lu Yanghao had just ascended the mountain, and the master had him copy and memorialize it. His illness was immediately cured. Thereafter, the master practiced this method among rivers and lakes, achieving manifest responses, and many sought the Dao.\n\nIn truth, this transmission employs the Four Generals of the Dharma’s Expedient Methods and the Four Immortals of Mount Shenshan as its foundation, establishing a method to deliver people, called the *Four Generals*. The *Purple Court* incorporates common medicinal herbs like *Yi* and *Qi*, which also prove efficacious.\n\nAt that time, Yan Tongpan of Fuzhou, styled Jing’an, established a Daoist abbey to welcome masters of the Dao from across the land. One day, the master arrived, and Yan received him with great courtesy.",

      "translated_text": "Jing’an’s younger brother, Fan Yuanxuan, served him with even greater reverence. The master, pleased by his devotion and recognizing his aptitude for receiving the Dao, transmitted this method to him. Yuanxuan practiced it with remarkable efficacy, though he had yet to deliver others. In his later years, beset by worldly upheavals and family poverty, he relocated to Lixian Township in Chongren, beneath an osmanthus tree on Huolu Ridge. He married a woman of the Zhao clan, whose nature inclined toward drink.\n\nAt that time, Guo Xueya of Huangxi, a clansman of the master’s elder brother, also studied under Yuanxuan, and both received the transmission of the *Eight Generals*. Xueya’s practice yielded verification, and he issued a talisman declaring: *\"The Daoist methods are further refined across the land, yet the* Purple Court *remains unmatched among rivers and lakes.\"* Upon seeing this, Yuanxuan remarked, *\"Even I have no end to my harmony.\"* From then on, Huang and Han incurred the master’s displeasure.\n\nYet Xueya remained at Yuanxuan’s door day and night, serving with labor and obedience beyond that of a slave, though he had still not received the full transmission. When Yuanxuan’s illness grew critical, he said to Xueya, *\"Among my four or five disciples, none have served me as you have. I shall die soon, yet I regret that my burial clothes, shroud, coffin, and outer casket remain unprepared—what is to be done?\"* Xueya replied, *\"Master, do not trouble yourself over this; your disciple will see to each detail.\"* Yuanxuan, pleased, swore an oath: *\"If you provide me with garments, I shall ensure you wear brocade. If you furnish the planks, I shall return two coffins to you.\"*\n\nHe then instructed, *\"Bring down the chest from my bed frame.\"* One by one, he examined the method texts within and handed them to Xueya, saying, *\"All has been thoroughly entrusted to you. Yet the method for pursuing consumptive ailments still holds the profound mysteries of the Inner Court—all of which are transmitted orally. Now I pass them to you.\"* And so he revealed all his secrets.\n\nAfter Yuanxuan’s death, Xueya clothed him in the prepared garments and buried him in the coffin from his own hall. By this method, Xueya’s name resounded across rivers and lakes. Though some of his disciples received the transmission, only my late father and Shi Yuru did so in full. The two families exchanged letters frequently yet never met, each unaware of what the other had attained.\n\nWhen Xueya transmitted the method to my late father, he said, *\"A hundred taels for the* Purple Court*, fifty taels for the* Flowing Water *method—this is all I teach you. If your son is unteachable, I shall not transmit further. If your grandson proves worthy, you must teach him for me.\"*\n\nOne day, my late father again prepared a token of sincerity and presented it, knowing Xueya had urgent need. Seizing the opportunity, he sought to exhaust all secrets. Xueya smiled and said, *\"The method is already complete; there is no need to ask further. The texts you may copy, but you must answer my urgency as I answer yours—like unending gold, I teach you so your descendants may benefit without end.\"*\n\nFrom my youth, I followed my late father in treating consumptive ailments for twenty years. Practicing this method for over twenty more, I have seen swift and resonant responses, aided by the efficacy of my late father’s spirit and the authority of his assisting generals.\n\nI have often reflected that those afflicted with consumptive illnesses, as the saying goes, *\"hide their ailments.\"* Truly, this is so. Those who contract such diseases fear others knowing or speaking of it—yet how can they not speak? The afflicted are deluded by ghosts, despising any mention of their condition. By the time they awaken and seek treatment, the illness has already deepened.\n\nMoreover, some physicians, though aware of the consumption and their own inability to cure it, conceal the truth to mislead the patient. Even as death approaches, they claim the illness is harmless. Alas, how can such medicine effect a cure?\n\nConsumption arises from five sources: *wine exhaustion, sexual exhaustion, depletion exhaustion, qi exhaustion,* and *transmitted exhaustion.* Their symptoms appear similar, but *transmitted consumption* involves worms and malevolent spirits, bringing calamity that even kin cannot sever.\n\nTransmitted consumption stems from five causes: contracting the illness from the clothing or fabrics of a consumptive household (*clothing transmission*); acquiring it through the utensils of an afflicted family (*utensil transmission*); inhabiting a consumptive’s dwelling (*dwelling transmission*); consuming food or drink sent by a consumptive household, or partaking of their wine and meat (*food transmission*); or mourning the dead and inhaling the *qi* of their corpse (*corpse transmission*). Those who fall ill without cause suffer from *flying corpse* or *wandering consumption*, often due to grudges, curses, or oral hexes.\n\nWhen one first contracts the illness, symptoms include alternating chills and fever, aching joints, vexing heat in the five centers, withered hair, dizziness, coughing with phlegm, vomiting or coughing blood, nausea, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest oppression, abdominal distension or pain, heartburn, bitter taste, dry tongue, sallow complexion, weakness, cravings for meat, or sudden aversion to food, swollen lymph nodes, nightmares of ghostly unions, seminal emissions, turbid urine, pain radiating from the back to the heart, throat sores, throbbing headaches, and disrupted yin-yang balance. Over years, the symptoms grow increasingly strange: worms may move throughout the body, or one may feel biting in the abdomen or back, or sense them intercepting food in the throat, or emerging from the genitals or anus—such bizarre manifestations are limitless.\n\nIn prolonged cases, symptoms worsen: edema, diarrhea, spontaneous sweating, night sweats, emaciated calves, loss of complexion, sore throat, wheezing, chest tightness, crimson lips, flushed face, blood-spotted skin, involuntary seminal emissions in men, uncontrolled vaginal discharge in women, blocked menstruation, throat sores—all dire signs, with ten out of ten cases proving fatal.\n\nFor those seeking treatment, one must first compose a sincere petition, detailing the symptoms and their causes. Relying on this, issue talismans for fumigation and verification, submit memorials to the spirits, pursue the worms, and administer restorative treatment to dispel the symptoms. The afflicted must cultivate themselves with utmost care, avoiding physical exertion. If they fail to observe the precepts—succumbing to cold or heat, excessive joy, anger, sorrow, or anxiety, overindulging in food or drink, neglecting hunger or overeating, or violating abstinence from wine and sex—if they disregard restorative care and moderation, the illness will soon recur, leaving no hope for recovery.",

      "translated_text": "On the first day of the jiashen year of the Zhizheng era, fifth-generation descendant Zhang Shunlie respectfully inscribed.\n\n**Procedures for Practice**\n\nFor all who come to the altar seeking treatment, first write three *Wash-Hand Talismans*, then seven *Fumigate-Brush Talismans*. Have the patient wash their hands with the *Wash-Hand Talisman* and soap, without drying with cloth to avoid lint, allowing the hands to air-dry. Some claim medicinal ingredients are used in the talismans, but I employ only water for washing. Once the hands are dry, rub them together briskly, then examine them closely.\n\nNext, light incense in a censer and burn one *Fumigate-Brush Talisman*, folding it into the flame. Have the patient hold their hands over the smoke, repeating the process for each talisman. Some may show results after one, others after three or five. If fine hairs appear in the smoke or upon re-fumigation, it confirms *consumptive transmission*; if none appear, the condition is not present. Careful observation is essential—mistaking lint for hairs wastes effort in treatment.\n\nWhen hairs emerge, note their color and location. The five viscera—green, yellow, red, white, and black—each correspond to specific afflictions. The hairs reveal which organ is damaged, their length, thickness, quantity, and whether they stretch, contract, soften, stiffen, or fork. If they appear at the *Heavenly Gate*, *Tiger’s Mouth*, *Ghost’s Door*, palm center, beneath fingers, on the back of the hand, or the upper joints of fingers—left for men, right for women—red or black, long or thick, contracted or extended, numerous, soft, or forked, with strange colors, these are all inauspicious signs. Careful examination reveals the depth of the illness.\n\nIf others have been preemptively sought for treatment and fumigation, and hairs appear, pursue the worms; if none appear, return to this altar for re-fumigation. The absence of hairs may result from improper invocation of the spirit-generals to restrain the worms during the initial talisman use, allowing them to escape into the bodies of the patient’s family or hide within walls. Use the proper method to summon and confine them to the patient’s original site of injury. After one or two days, reapply the talismans for fumigation—hairs will surely appear.\n\nIn cases where the worms have damaged the kidneys, fumigation often yields no hairs, yet pursuit may still reveal worms. This is a known occurrence.\n\nWhen hairs appear during fumigation, record the symptoms and submit a petition to the *Northern Emperor*, the *Northern Dipper*, the *Four Saints*, and the *Zongshi of Mount Hua*. Issue talismans to pursue the worms: first, place one *General Talisman* at the front of the room. Then, use forty-nine talismans, ingesting seven daily while awaiting a response.\n\nWhen the worms descend, signs will manifest akin to the three therapeutic methods of sweating, vomiting, and purging in medicine. Three, seven, or fifteen days after ingesting the talismans, the body may grow hot and sweat—remain still until itching arises, as if insects crawl across the skin. This is the *sweating* response. Wipe the body clean with clothing, then boil and rewear it. Burn the bedding as well.\n\nIf nausea and retching occur, the patient will vomit worms, foul phlegm, or undigested food—examine the contents for worms. This is the *vomiting* response. If the abdomen rumbles or aches, signaling a bowel movement, avoid using the latrine. Collect the excrement in a chamber pot; whether loose or hard, worms will be present. This is the *purging* response. Worms expelled through vomiting or purging are large and visible, while those in sweat are small and hard to see.\n\nThe forms of worms vary: some resemble infants, snakes, rats, loaches, eels, toads, tadpoles, mosquitoes, gnats, ants, lice, or other creatures; others appear as tangled silk, rotting floss, flesh balls, hair, horsehair, palm fiber, grass seeds, hemp, millet, fruit pits, essence-blood, glue, lacquer, rotting dough, or phlegm—countless shapes, impossible to describe fully. Examine them closely and burn them to prevent recurrence. If discarded outdoors, rain and dew may revive them. The worms, pressed by thunder and fire, may die if small, but larger ones survive—this has been observed in expelled worms.\n\nThe original method of pursuing worms relies on the three responses of sweating, vomiting, and purging. After years of practice, variations have emerged. Some patients sweat first from the feet, then the legs, followed by the buttocks, arms, flanks, and head, recovering in stages. Others, after twenty-one days of pursuit, show no response but nosebleeds; upon washing and examining the blood, worms as thick as shoelaces and over six inches long were found. Still others expelled centipedes from their ears, or worms the size of ants crawled from their beards and faces. Such strange phenomena are limitless. Without proper method, worms may flee.\n\nWhen pursuing worms with talismans, proceed gradually—do not invoke the *Seven Ghosts* or impose deadlines for responses. Trust in the spirit-officers’ discretion. If the talismans are ingested too hastily, the worms may thrash and die within the consumed organs, worsening the damage and making restoration difficult. The patient may soon perish. A gradual approach allows thunder and fire to weaken the worms, preventing further feeding until they perish from exhaustion. The talismans in this tradition include restorative treatment, so by the time the worms descend, the damaged areas have already begun healing—delay is thus preferable. Premature expulsion leaves the viscera depleted and *original qi* weakened, making restoration difficult. Delay ensures the viscera remain firm and *original yang* intact, facilitating easy recovery. Other traditions prioritize swift responses, but many fail to recover.\n\nIn households where many have perished from this illness, the worms grow large and gain intelligence, able to move in and out of bodies, hide in walls, circulate *qi*, and spread toxins to infect others.",

If they fail to observe the precepts—succumbing to cold or heat, excessive joy, anger, sorrow, or anxiety, overindulging in food or drink, neglecting hunger or overeating, or violating abstinence from wine and sex—if they disregard restorative care and moderation, the illness will soon recur, leaving no hope for recovery.",

In critical cases where the five viscera are failing, the corpse-worms emerge one month—or even half a month—before the patient’s death, hence the saying: *\"When the worms depart, the person perishes.\"* Some claim the worms must not be expelled, warning that their removal leads to death—this is a grave error. Others, observing the patient’s critical state, advocate first restoring then expelling, but this too is misguided. If the worms are not pursued and eradicated, they will fester within, consuming the flesh like maggots, spreading corruption—how then could the patient survive?

      "translated_text": "The master draws the *qi* of the Central Heaven, enters the central [aperture] to stir it, and exhales toward the extreme northwest heights. He envisions the Purple Tenuity Emperor Star, vast as a chariot wheel, its light illuminating the earth, and parts his hands. The Northern Emperor issues his command to restrain and seize. The *Kui*-*Gang* roars into motion, enforcing the seizure. The *Zi-Wu* Dipper and the Second Dipper clash open the stellar enclosure; the master perceives the Great Emperor within. He inhales *qi* to suffuse his body, declaring, \"I am the Northern Culmen,\" and summons at once.\n\n\"Fiery Emperor’s scorching blood, the Four Luminaries shatter the corpse; Heavenly Strategist annihilates the kind. With one stroke of the divine blade, ten thousand ghosts scatter in rout.\"\n\nSolemnly he summons the Fiery Emperor’s Scorching Blood Envoys: \"Hasten to the altar at my command.\" The summons complete, the master faces south. He circulates kidney-water upward to strike the heart-fire, and the envoys ascend the twin passes of the spine, traverse the twelve-storied tower, and emerge from the spirit chamber, merging with the southern quadrant into one. They manifest instantly in *Li*. The master unites with primordial *qi*, and with his gaze directs the characters \"one,\" \"three,\" and \"seven\" upon the left-hand Jade Seal—golden light is the Dao.\n\nOnce the Scorching Blood Generals have arrived at the altar, he raises the imperial decree and commands them to proceed directly to the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, summoning Marshal Xiong, the Great General of Consumptive Pursuit; Marshal Liu, the Great General of Affliction-Severing; Marshal Zhou, the Great General of Deafening Troops; Marshal Li, the Great General of the Mute; Marshal Zhao, the Great General of the Furrowed Brow; and all their subordinate officers and generals. \"Hasten to the altar at my command.\"\n\nThe summons complete, the master wields his sword-finger to sever, bestowing upon the great marshals the breath of command. They ascend directly to the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. The master grasps the Purple Tenuity Enclosure Seal and recites the Black Emperor’s incantation of the North:\n\n\"Northern Black Emperor, supreme among the myriad sages.\nGreat Tenuity’s Six *Jia*, the Five *Qi* Spirit Lords.\nRadiance surpassing sun and moon, might encompassing heaven and earth.\nFlying talismans seize the registers, severing the gates of ghosts.\nMarching spirits deploy *qi*, dispelling the Five Pestilences.\nLeft and right officers and soldiers, the Three and Five Generals.\nThunder Lords and thunderbolts, lightning flashing through racing clouds.\nBlades like rain, ranks like clouds.\nHolding the imperial chime, crowned with Kunlun.\nPatrolling the world, hunting demonic essences.\nThe Earth Gods of the Nine Provinces, the blood-feeding guests—\nnone dare resist.\nShould any dare to spread their scales,\nthe Star of Stability binds their hands,\nthe Northern Emperor seizes their souls,\nthe Three Terraces and Seven Stars wield swords to sever their bodies.\nCrimes shall not be lightly punished; calamity shall befall yourselves.\nDemonic essences and *wangliang*—let not your ears hear.\nWhoever hears my incantation shall have their heads shattered, brains split,\nscattered like fine dust.\"\n\nSolemnly he summons Marshal Xiong, the Great General of Consumptive Pursuit; Marshal Liu, the Great General of Affliction-Severing; Marshal Zhou, the Great General of Deafening Troops; Marshal Li, the Great General of the Mute; Marshal Zhao, the Great General of the Furrowed Brow; and all officers and generals of the Heavenly Pen Inner Court. \"Hasten to the altar at my command.\" The master extends the Purple Tenuity Seal with his left hand, raises the golden light, and guides the gaze of the generals, clearly manifesting them within the altar from the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, ready to be dispatched at will.\n\nThis posthumous-severing jade talisman is inscribed while reciting the Heavenly Pen Mantra. Upon completion, it is infused into the *Du-Tong* over the corpse-killing ghost. Before the third seven-day period, the principal and secondary talismans are applied to the demonic essence. Using the Northern Black Mantra, the names of the five generals are inscribed upon the *Du-Tong*, infused with primordial *qi* and sealed with three seven-fold presses. As commonly employed, this ensures total subjugation, swiftly extinguishing corpse-demons and demonic essences.\n\nNext, he mobilizes thunder:\n\"Reverently I invoke the Heavenly Thunder, the Heavenly Emperor Shi;\nthe *Qian* Earth Thunder shakes the earth to the heavens.\n*Kun*’s left harbors the Poisonous Thunder, ever shining;\nits right holds the Poisonous Thunder, flashing with lightning.\nSpring thunder constantly strikes flying sky-demons;\nsummer thunder strikes earthly evil to annihilation.\nAutumn thunder flashes, racing through the clouds;\nwinter thunder strikes ten thousand evils to extinction.\nThe halting thunder, the great tree without shelter—\nmay it ever protect the myriad people and descend auspiciousness.\n*Om du-liu, da du-liu, fei du-liu*, restrain and seize!\"\n\nWith the left formation, he turns once beneath the left flank—heaven and earth quake.\nThe second turn darkens sun and moon.\nThe third turn at *Xun* stirs the *Kui*-*Gang*.\nThe fourth turn at *Li* ignites thunder-fire.\nThe fifth turn at the center shakes with thunderbolts.\nThe sixth turn at *Kun* crushes the malevolent.\nThe seventh turn at *Gen* captures and seizes those who defy heaven and lack the Dao—\nconsumptive transmission, hidden contagion, all demonic essences.\nSwiftly they submit beneath my Five Thunder *Kui*-*Gang*,\nbound to die, motionless and inert.\n\nWith the right formation, he visualizes beneath the waist: the two hands as the Direct Thunder Envoys, the two kidneys as the Thunder-Climbing Prefecture, the lower abdomen as the Penglai Capital Water Bureau, the heart as the Thunderclap Capital Bureau, the twenty-four vertebrae as the Halting Thunder Great Tree. He stabilizes the two formations, rising from the lower abdomen to the heart, then back to the abdomen, channeling directly from the flanks to the ears as the Thunder Cavern. With one strike, the talisman is infused, envisioning heaven and earth overturned, drawing *qi* into the center through the dual formations.\n\nNext, he recites the Five Fire Mantra:\n\"Heavenly Fire, Earthly Fire,\nYang Fire, Yin Fire,\nthe true fire of my heart,\nthe true fire of the Great Yang,\nthe Five Thunders of the Four Seasons,\nthe roaming true fire.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\"\n\nThe incantation complete, the master hooks his little fingers together, pulling from *Yin* to *Wu* to ignite.

The upper stroke severs flying corpses; the middle, human transmission; the lower, wandering consumptive *qi*—his left foot crossing over *gen* to halt it.\n\nThen he recites the Golden Light Mantra once, envisioning all generals enveloped within its radiance. Golden *qi* spreads above, resplendent with golden light.\n\nNext, he visualizes the heavens darkening and the earth blackening, holding his breath to observe the karmic retribution. Transforming his spirit into the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, he draws the Great Heavenly Northern *qi* to suffuse his body, then inscribes the □ character within.\n\nFollowing this, he intones the *Xu Xuanyu* Mantra, summoning Tianpeng, Tianyu, Yisheng, and Yousheng to lead their troops into the talisman, eroding and consuming it. He then envisions the Four Saints arriving from the four directions to enter the talisman.\n\nNext, he recites the Tianpeng Mantra, solemnly invoking:\nThe Primordial Responding Great August Prefecture’s Tianpeng Supreme Emperor, with three hundred thousand troops, entering the talisman from the east.\n\nThen the Tianyu Mantra, solemnly invoking:\nThe Primordial Radiance Cinnabar Heavenly Prefecture’s Tianyu Supreme Emperor, with three hundred thousand troops, entering the talisman from the south.\n\nThen the Yisheng Mantra, solemnly invoking:\nThe Primordial Illumination Purple Void Prefecture’s Yisheng Perfected Lord, with three hundred thousand troops, entering the talisman from the west.\n\nThen the Yousheng Mantra, solemnly invoking:\nThe Primordial Harmony Relocation Prefecture’s Yousheng Perfected Lord, with three hundred thousand troops, entering the talisman from the north.\n\nNext, he envisions all generals within the talisman, enveloped in the *qi* of slaughter. After serving the Thunder Rites, no fire is used—only the inscription of the Heavenly August Emperor’s seal and the Golden Light Mantra. He visualizes the generals within, then inscribes the Four Saints’ summons to enter, drawing upon the Great Heavenly Slaughter *qi* for efficacy, and seals it with □.\n\nFor nocturnal operations, the sequence is as follows:\nInitiate the sacred rites, summon the generals, offer sacrifices to dispatch them, conduct thorough searches, perform the *xinggai* ritual, assemble and ascend the altar, send off the deceased, and conclude.\n\nUpon ascending the altar, prepare black water and seal the five cosmic locks of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe master concentrates his spirit in silent prayer:\n\"Rosy light illumines golden hues,\nI gaze in reverence at the master’s majestic form.\nSlaughter-*qi* congeals like frost,\nFrom afar, I behold the marshal’s solemn might.\"\n\nThe disciple of the lineage, [Name], prostrates and offers incense, respectfully invoking:\nThe Heavenly Teaching Master, Lord of Humanity and Devas, the Manifestly Efficacious and Divinely Responsive Protector of the Realm Perfected Lord;\nThe Wondrous Dao Teaching Master, the Right-Assisting and Wondrously Efficacious, Thoroughly Responsive Great Void Perfected Lord;\nThe Sincere Teaching Master, the Manifestly Assisting and Karmically Responsive, Wondrously Distant Perfected Lord.\n\n\"With utmost reverence, I beseech the sagely master to witness and illuminate. Today, on behalf of [Name], I establish the Supreme Black Prison of Grievances. I humbly implore the sagely master to preside over the altar, uphold the teachings, empower the talismans, and guide the household’s unrepentant, unenlightened karmic ghosts and vengeful spirits into the Golden Towers and Jade Chambers, that they may be bound and eradicated. I earnestly pray for the sagely master’s manifest response.\"\n\nSummoning the Generals:\nThe master draws the Golden Light *qi*, exhaling it into the prison, envisioning it as the Golden Towers and Jade Chambers, adorned with rare treasures, exotic flowers, and sumptuous delicacies, all arrayed in perfect clarity. The sagely master stands at the forefront to receive them, then summons Zhe’e:\n\n\"By the decree of the Northern Bureau,\nWind and fire shall not cease.\nZhe’e Great General,\nSwiftly reveal your true form!\"\n\nIssuing the command, he summons the great generals to descend from the northwest, guard the prison, and await further summons.\n\n\"The Heavenly August Emperor’s decree descends,\nThe Northern Emperor takes command.\nAbove, summon the Thunder Department;\nBelow, summon the mountain, marsh, and local deities of the sacrificial register.\nHasten to obey the imperial edict,\nArray the troops in formation.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\"\n\nIn silence, he envisions the thunder deities and sacrificial register spirits stationed on all sides for protection. He instructs trusted attendants to maintain vigilant guard, ensuring no movement.\n\nThen, entering each chamber, he presents the catalpa-wood talismans, proclaims the official documents, and burns them. Executing the Fire Wheel Mudra, he envisions a raging inferno scorching the heavens and slaughtering the earth. Stamping his foot thrice, he sees the malevolent consumptive ghosts and *zha* spirits seized and cast ten thousand fathoms into the earth.\n\nNext, he employs the Heavenly Thunder and Heavenly Emperor’s Release, arranging the formation to mobilize thunder, overturning Heaven and Earth to gather *qi*.\n\nThen he recites:\n\"The Dao of Heaven severs,\nThe Dao of Earth at *hai* severs.\nThe human Dao at *xun* flourishes,\nThe ghost Dao at *kun* severs.\n*Gen* severs all transmission of consumptive ghosts forever,\nA thousand years shall they not meet,\nTen thousand ages shall they not encounter.\nMy talisman severs once,\nAll ghosts are eternally eradicated at the root.\"\n\nAgain, he mobilizes thunder, overturning Heaven and Earth. Holding his breath, he seals the Nine Orifices with his left hand covering his face like Mount Tai, his right sleeve concealing them, preventing any *qi* from escaping. The Yellow River flows backward as he observes the *qi*’s karmic response.\n\nNext, he solemnly invokes:\nThe Primordial Responding Great August Prefecture’s Unified *Qi* Commander-in-Chief;\nThe Consumptive-Pursuing Great General, Marshal Xiong;\nThe Consumptive-Severing Great General, Marshal Liu;\nThe Deafening Troops Great General, Marshal Zhou;\nThe Mute General, Marshal Li;\nThe Zhe’e Great General, Marshal Zhao;\nAnd all attending officials and generals.\n\n\"Today, lead your troops into the talisman and station yourselves here, dedicated to exterminating consumptive transmission, flying corpses, corpse-worms, ghostly entities, and seizing affliction-toxins and affliction-*qi*. Protect the household and kin, severing the source of calamity forever. Rely upon your divine might to enforce these prohibitions.\"\n\nThe master proceeds through each chamber, performing the rites accordingly. He envisions each chamber’s light penetrating the altar, the entire space engulfed in thunder and fire, driving the corpse-ghosts to flee into the Jade Chambers.\n\nAs the master performs the rites, he exhales three mouthfuls of slaughter-*qi* onto the altar, envisioning the *qi* of Heaven and Earth coalescing in slaughter. The altar transforms into the Northern Culmen Demon-Subduing Heavenly Palace, the Jade Chambers into the Northern Prison. The master becomes the Great Emperor, exhaling the mudra to dispatch the generals and seize the spirits.\n\nEmploying the Urgent Net-Forming Mudra, he traces from *gen* into the prison, beseeching the heavenly generals to apprehend the ghosts and imprison them. Casting the divination blocks to deploy the net, he seizes them one by one. If any remain unseized, he secretly dispatches the Consumptive-Severing Great General to pursue them.\n\nNow, he proclaims aloud:\n\"By imperial decree, the supervisory marsh officials are jointly commanded to ensure the capture of the household of [Name], who have defied Heaven and Earth, disobeyed the imperial decree, and harbored the vengeful ghosts of consumptive ancestors and karmic spirits. Seize them and imprison them, that their transgressions may be manifestly revealed and requited.\"\n\nUpon completing the incantation and obtaining the divination blocks, he employs the Dipper Ladle and *guan* ritual implements, concluding with the slaughter-sealing and decapitation-sealing rites.",
