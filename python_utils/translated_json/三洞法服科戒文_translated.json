My ignorance prevents me from discerning this. I implore you to clarify and instruct future generations.\"*\n\nThe Most High replied:\n\n*\"Attire is the adornment of the body. According to the differing grades of endowment and rank, each has its own regulations and rites. There are nine ranks in total. Listen carefully, and I shall explain them to you.\"*\n\n**First:** The Great Law-King of the Primordial Beginning, the Celestial Worthy of the Original Commencement, wears a crown that transforms ten thousand times in an instant into a nine-jeweled radiant crown. His robe is a thousand-patterned, spontaneously merging-and-parting cloud mantle. He dons a ten-turn, nine-transforming azure brocade floral skirt, a seven-luminous, four-radiant, variegated jeweled sash, and ten-jeweled lotus slippers of fivefold transformation. His attendant perfected ones are identically attired.\n\n**Second:** The Law-King of the Jade Purity, the Formless Celestial Worthy, wears a crown that transforms a thousand times in an instant into a seven-jeweled radiant crown. His robe is a hundred-patterned, merging-and-parting flying-cloud mantle. He dons a nine-turn, seven-transforming kingfisher brocade flying skirt, a seven-luminous, four-radiant rosy-cloud brocade sash, and cinnabar-cloud embroidered slippers of seven-jeweled transformation. His attendant perfected ones are likewise attired.\n\n**Third:** The Law-King of the Highest Purity, the Nameless Celestial Worthy, wears a crown that transforms a hundred times in an instant into a five-jeweled radiant crown. His robe is a ten-patterned, merging-and-parting flowing-sky mantle. He dons an eight-turn, five-transforming yellow brocade rosy skirt, a seven-luminous, four-radiant flying-light brocade sash, and spontaneously formed jadeite slippers of fivefold hues. His attendant perfected ones are likewise attired.\n\n**Fourth:** The Law-King of the Grand Purity, the Celestial Worthy of the Great One, wears a crown that transforms ten times in an instant into a lotus-essence jeweled crown. His robe is a nine-patterned, merging-and-parting five-cloud floral mantle. He dons a seven-turn, four-transforming purple brocade feathered skirt, a seven-luminous, four-radiant dark-light cinnabar sash, and spontaneously manifesting lion-patterned slippers. His attendant perfected ones are likewise attired.\n\n**Fifth:** The Transformative Lord of the Four Brahmā Heavens, the Formless Celestial Worthy, wears a flowing-essence luminous sun-flower crown. His robe is a dark-phoenix jade-flower mantle. He dons a kingfisher brocade cinnabar-feathered flying skirt, a five-luminous rosy-cloud jeweled sash, and flying-dragon transforming slippers. His attendant perfected ones are likewise attired.\n\nAdditionally:\n- Purple mantle with azure skirt,\n- Dark-green mantle with cinnabar skirt,\n- Green mantle with crimson skirt,\n- Cinnabar mantle with yellow skirt,\n- Yellow mantle with plain skirt,\n- Crimson dragon-brocade skirt—\n\nall are the vestments of attendant perfected ones. From the Four Brahmā Heavens upward, all garments are spontaneously formed from flying clouds and flowing skies, wondrous qi congealed into raiment. Nine-jeweled radiant light gives birth to the myriad things. Their length and size adapt to the realm and assume form accordingly.\n\nSome manifest with eightfold luminous radiance, their perfect forms resplendent and boundless, their brilliance illuminating far and near, their transformations arising naturally. Others combine nine hues to produce ten thousand distinct glows, or weave dragon-phoenix patterns, or shape flowing mountains and waters—endlessly shifting, beyond all naming. Even the governance of cities and ramparts, palaces and halls, towers and terraces, pavilions and kiosks, grasses and trees, birds and beasts, chariots and carriages, vessels and implements, banners and canopies, curtains and thrones—all ritual instruments—are spontaneously formed, appearing in response to conditions, fundamentally without substance or obstruction, now hidden, now revealed, never constant.\n\nSixth, the sacred vestments of the immortals and perfected ones in the Formless Heavens, along with the Heavenly Emperors: they wear flying-cloud jeweled crowns, nine-hued seamless mantles, kingfisher-dragon patterned skirts, five-colored brocade sashes, and auspicious-luan jade slippers. All arise naturally, manifesting at the thought’s inception. Even their palaces and towers, chariots and carriages, vessels and implements, toys and adornments, gardens and fruits, music and ritual instruments—all necessities—are likewise so.\n\nSeventh, the sacred ranks of immortals in the Form Heavens, along with the Heavenly Emperors: they wear lotus-morning crowns, flying-cloud brocade mantles, rosy-cloud flying skirts, flowing-light brocade sashes, and jade-phoenix patterned slippers. Though possessing form and substance, these are not crafted by the world’s hands but are akin to the natural. Even their dwellings, chariots, ritual instruments—all arise at the heart’s desire, manifesting at thought’s inception, transforming with sovereign ease, unlike the mundane.\n\nEighth, the sacred ranks of immortals in the Desire Heavens: they wear pearl-and-jade crowns, five-cloud mantles, flying-flower kingfisher skirts, flowing-light feathered sashes, and nine-light patterned slippers. All are woven from the realm’s native plants, or obtained from other heavens, or presented by lower immortals—crafted without the toil of the lower worlds. Even their dwellings and halls, chariots and ritual objects, are likewise so.\n\nNinth, the numinous palaces atop mountains, and the immortals, divine officials, and territorial guardians of the Five Marchmounts and famous grotto-heavens: they wear seven-jeweled crowns, nine-light rosy-cloud mantles, flying-green-flower skirts, cloud-brocade sashes, and luan-phoenix patterned slippers. All are fashioned from celestial brocades and silks or the world’s treasures, or refined through transformation—unlike the world’s manufactures. Some ride luan-birds or mount cranes, rein in dragons and tigers, or command white deer, lions, numinous birds, and divine beasts. They traverse flying clouds and cinnabar skies, ride green jade chariots and wheel-borne palanquins, bearing banners and sounding drums, wielding talismans and grasping registers. They move in and out of the human realm, fulfilling desires at heart’s call, appearing in response to karmic conditions. Some are upper-world perfected ones descending to teach in the world, their attire for the occasion no different from mortals; others are lower-world immortals ascending to the heavens, their vestments and mounts matching the higher realms, yet naturally transformed—truly beyond the reckoning of your mortal sentiments.\n\nThe Heavenly Master asked: “Clothing, by nature, is for those with form. Now the highest sages are formless—why then do they don vestments?”\n\nThe Most High replied: “The highest sages, being formless, truly have no need of clothing. Yet when they manifest traces in the human realm, they assume vestments. If they return to the true and revert to the origin, abiding in quiescent spontaneity, even form and shadow are empty—how much more clothing? Though they now show traces, they may be broadly divided into nine grades, but in essence, there are two kinds:\n\nFirst, the clothing of the unclothed: those above the Four Brahmā Heavens, whose wondrous bodies are naturally so, endlessly transforming, fundamentally without form or substance. Now hidden, now revealed, they manifest responsive bodies to guide the lower worlds, temporarily assuming vestments to teach in accord with conditions, adapting their appearance to the realm. Their spiritual efficacy is spontaneous, their transformations unfathomable. This is the unclothed donning clothing—appearing as the common to instruct the common.\n\nSecond, the clothing of the clothed: those below the Three Realms, down to the worthy who have renounced the world, whose forms remain coarse and have yet to merge with the Dao. In their comings and goings, they require the dignity of ritual. Their vestments follow graded observances, resulting in distinctions. There are seven kinds, which must be followed according to the rules. Though kalpas may turn, this Dharma remains unchanged.\n\nFirst, upon entering the Dao’s gate: a plain cap and yellow mantle.\nSecond, in the Orthodox Unity tradition: a lotus-black crown, yellow skirt, and crimson robe.\nThird, in the Dao and Virtue tradition: a yellow robe and black turban.\nFourth, in the Cavern Spirit tradition: a black crown and blue robe.\nFifth, in the Cavern Mystery tradition: a yellow robe and black crown, paired with a yellow skirt. The crown resembles a lotus, either four-sided with two leaves. The robe is three zhang and six chi long, with a body three chi and six cun; for women, two zhang and four chi, with a body two chi and four cun. Sleeves, collars, belts, and borders are made sufficient, with thirty-two strips for the mantle, using two zhang and four chi—twenty-four strips for both men and women.\n\nSixth, in the Cavern Perfection tradition: the robe and mantle use thirty-six chi of purple gauze, their length as in the Cavern Mystery method. The outer layer is blue, with sleeves, collar, and belt made sufficient. The outer has twenty-five strips, the inner fourteen, totaling thirty-nine. The skirt is a flying-green-flower pattern, the crown a lotus-jeweled one, or a four-sided three-leafed crown called the Yuanshi Crown. For women, the robe uses twenty-four chi of purple gauze, two chi and four cun long, with twenty-three strips for the body and sixteen for the sleeves, totaling thirty-nine, paired with a blue-gauze skirt and a flying-cloud phoenix-qi crown.\n\nSeventh, for the Three Caverns’ Dharma-teachers: as in the Highest Clarity vestments, with nine colors added. If wearing five-hued rosy-cloud mountain-water sleeve-mantles and a Yuanshi Jeweled Crown, with jade pendants, ritual tablets, and lion-patterned slippers, these are called Dharma-vestments. They are always attended and protected by heavenly youths and maidens, jade lads and lasses. One must not be careless or err, for all heavens revere them, and all demons submit. Strive diligently in this.\n\nThe Heavenly Master asked: “I wonder, for those in the lower world who inherit and uphold the sagely teachings, how should their Dharma-vestments be?”\n\nThe Most High replied: “For future men and women who cultivate my Dharma, leaving the secular to become monastics, they must uphold the Three Caverns’ talismans, scriptures, and precepts. They should fashion their vestments according to these regulations, following the depth of their scriptures and precepts. They must not be careless or mix them with the attire of immortals and perfected ones.”\n\nOne must always maintain purity, burning incense to the left and right, ensuring no defilement or pollution befouls the numinous spirits. The *guan* (crown) means \"observation\"—inwardly observing the body, binding great karmic affinity, so that the hundred spirits of heaven and earth revere and serve one. One must treasure and honor it, safeguarding it with the Dao, restraining the six emotions, curbing greed and desire, emptying the mind and stilling thoughts, washing away worldly toil, and maintaining utmost sincerity in every thought to attain the Dao’s fruit. Outwardly observing things, one sees that none are one’s own; deluded attachment and covetousness disturb the heart. One must observe the wondrous, ever free from desire, for through such observation, virtue adorns the body, emulating the Three Luminaries to illuminate within and without, like the lotus flower dwelling in the world yet unstained.\n\nMoreover, the flower is the beginning of the fruit; the crown, worn upon the head, embodies perfect comprehension without obstruction. The *pèi* (scarf) means \"to drape\"—inwardly, it reveals the liver and heart, free from all impurities; outwardly, it displays and propagates the Dao and virtue, awakening sentient beings. It enables inner and outer to flow unimpeded, benefiting self and others alike, teaching and transforming in due time, delivering all beings, guiding them to take refuge—this is the highest path. The *hè* (robe) means \"to restrain\" and \"to sever\"—inwardly restraining emotions and desires, preventing their outward manifestation, cutting off the six roots to forever extinguish their sprouts; outwardly restraining greed and acquisition, preventing their inward intrusion, severing attachment to things to forever dispel afflictions. With inner and outer restraints severed and both self and others forgotten, one practices the Dao and recites scriptures without fail.\n\nThe *qún* (skirt) means \"multitude\"—inwardly severing the multitude of delusions, outwardly dispelling the multitude of burdens, gathering and transforming all things to enter the One Vehicle, forever escaping the cage of the world, universally liberating all. The crown emulates heaven, bearing the image of the Three Luminaries; the skirt emulates earth, taking the form of the Five Peaks; the scarf models yin and yang, possessing the power of generation and completion. Together, they are called Dharma-vestments, named \"leaving the household.\" Inwardly, they adorn the body, regulating the six roots and three karmas, refining form and spirit; outwardly, they adorn sentient beings, rescuing those in the three evil destinies and five paths, extending salvation to humans and heavens, saints and mortals alike, so all may know what to emulate, venerating the path of luminous conduct.\n\nFurthermore, the vestments of the Heavenly Worthy and perfected immortals uphold scriptures and precepts, teaching and transforming the world. They ensure that master and disciple follow one another, the true Dao flowing unimpeded. Exchanging secular attire for immortal robes, the Dao can clothe all things, and virtue can be emulated by others—through such causes and conditions, they are called Dharma-vestments.\n\nThe Most High said: \"In the past, I wore a sunlit scarf while reciting the *Precious Scripture of the Cavern of Perfection*; a moonlit cloak while reciting the *True Scripture of the Cavern of Mystery*; a starlit scarf while reciting the *Scripture of the Cavern of Divinities*; a nine-colored *li luo* scarf while expounding the *Great Vehicle Scriptures of the Three Caverns*; a five-colored cloud scarf while teaching and transforming the world; a scarf of natural spontaneity while roaming the heavens; a scarf of myriad-transforming clouds while ascending to the Great Luo; and a luminous, jeweled scarf while descending to rescue those in the three evil destinies. I was always attended by two hundred and forty jade lads and maidens who tended to my Dharma-vestments, burning pure incense.\n\nIf a Daoist, one must always prepare their Dharma-vestments, adorning their appearance, bathing and donning the crown and sash to reverently serve the heavenly perfected and teach all beings. One must never temporarily set aside the Dharma-vestments, neglecting dignified conduct, lest non-persons violate the Dharma-vestments.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Master bowed his head, paid homage, and received the teachings. After receiving the Dharma-vestments, he immediately expounded forty-six precepts and prohibitions to transmit to future generations:\n\n1. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not ascend the altar, enter seclusion, perform rituals, make vows, or seek blessings through repentance.\n2. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not approach scriptures and precepts, lecture, recite, read, or expound them.\n3. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not uphold fasts and precepts, receive others’ bows, or partake in food offerings.\n4. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not bow to masters, esteemed elders, or receive disciples’ bows.\n5. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not enter or leave one’s dwelling, travel among the world, or meet with laypeople.\n6. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not perform talismanic incantations, memorials, or petitions.\n7. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not pay respects to rulers, parents, or any worldly people.\n8. When resting or at leisure, one must remove the Dharma-vestments.\n9. When bathing or washing, one must remove the Dharma-vestments.\n10. When relieving oneself, one must remove the Dharma-vestments.\n11. In mud, rain, or filth, one must remove the Dharma-vestments.\n12. When serving or attending to masters, elders, or parents, one must not remove the Dharma-vestments.\n13. When inspecting or constructing meritorious works, one must not remove the Dharma-vestments.\n14. When inspecting or preparing vegetarian offerings, flowers, or fruits, one must not remove the Dharma-vestments.\n15. When inspecting or cultivating plants, one must not remove the Dharma-vestments.\n16. Unless in shackles, imprisonment, illness, or suffering, one must not remove the Dharma-vestments.\n17. With unclean hands or feet, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n18. With unclean vessels, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n19. With unclean bedding or mats, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n20. With unclean carriages or palanquins, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n21. When naked or exposed, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n22. In the presence of birds, beasts, insects, or fish, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n23. With foul or putrid breath, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n24. In the presence of non-disciples or non-students, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n25. When first leaving the household, one must first prepare Dharma-vestments.\n26. When receiving scriptures and precepts, one must prepare Dharma-vestments.\n27. When visiting a master to request scriptures, Daoist precepts, or registers, one must don Dharma-vestments.\n28. When visiting a master to seek blessings or alleviate suffering, one must don Dharma-vestments.\n29. Dharma-vestments may not be made with five colors.\n30. Dharma-vestments may not be made from improper materials.\n\n31. Dharma-vestments may not be made with brocade or embroidered silk.\n32. Dharma-vestments may not be made without following the proper method.\n33. Dharma-vestments may not be borrowed from others.\n34. Dharma-vestments may not be casually discarded.\n35. Dharma-vestments may not be placed upon the bed for rest.\n36. Dharma-vestments may not be sat or lain upon.\n37. Dharma-vestments may not be washed by trampling with the feet or beaten with a mallet.\n38. When Dharma-vestments are damaged, they must be purified by fire.\n39. One may not possess more than three sets of Dharma-vestments; the rest should be offered to others.\n40. Damaged Dharma-vestments or remaining materials may not be used for improper purposes or worn by ordinary people.\n41. Upon completing Dharma-vestments, one must burn incense, make a declaration, pay homage to the Three Treasures, first offer them to the Three Treasures and all the Immortals and Sages, and only then may one wear them.\n42. Dharma-vestments that have been near scriptures or images may not be worn in the mundane world or unclean places.\n43. Dharma-vestments must be frequently washed, purified with incense, stored in a clean box, and kept from defilement, always placed in a pure chamber.\n44. One may not wear Dharma-vestments while visiting the five kinds of households.\n45. One may not secretly remove Dharma-vestments to roam among the mundane.\n46. In sitting, rising, resting, or sleeping, one must always follow the precepts and regulations.\n\nThe Celestial Master said: A Daoist who safeguards the Dharma-vestments should treat them as their own eyes, or as their hands and feet. Why is this? If one has no eyes, one cannot see the myriad things of heaven and earth, nor discern good from evil or right from wrong. If one has no hands or feet, one cannot move the body or walk near or far, sit or stand. Such a person is incomplete, like a blind being. A Daoist who does not uphold the Dharma-vestments loses ten kinds of reverence and incurs ten kinds of contempt: first, the heavens do not revere them; second, the demonic forces do not revere them; third, spirits and gods do not revere them; fourth, emperors and kings do not revere them; fifth, parents do not revere them; sixth, brothers do not revere them; seventh, sisters do not revere them; eighth, family members do not revere them; ninth, the noble do not revere them; tenth, the lowly do not revere them. They also incur ten kinds of contempt: first, the heavens hold them in contempt; second, demonic forces despise them; third, spirits and gods hold them in contempt; fourth, emperors and kings hold them in contempt; fifth, parents hold them in contempt; sixth, brothers hold them in contempt; seventh, sisters hold them in contempt; eighth, family members hold them in contempt; ninth, the noble hold them in contempt; tenth, the lowly hold them in contempt. Wherever they go in this life, they lose their superior blessings and in past lives are reborn as pigs or dogs. If one safeguards the Dharma-vestments, wherever they go in this life, they receive their due reward. Those reborn among the heavens in past lives—whether men or women—would rather remove their own clothing than remove the Dharma-vestments of one who has left the household; they would rather face a venomous snake than violate the Dharma-vestments of one who has left the household; they would rather sit in a great pit of fire than sit with one who has left the household. If a Daoist discards the Dharma-vestments to pursue worldly glory, their blessings are exhausted. Though they may briefly shine, misfortune will soon arrive, and in past lives they enter the hell of freezing ice, later to be reborn in a naked and exposed body. Why is this? Such a person brings ruin upon themselves.\n\nThe Heavenly Master states: Those who should wear the vestments but do not, or those who wear them when they should not, shall be examined by the Four Administrators of the soul, and their lifespan reduced by one thousand two hundred years.\n\nThe Heavenly Master states: Daoist robes, bedding, and sitting mats must not be made of azure-green, deep green, crimson, red, dark blue, black, white, brocade, damask, embroidery, painted designs, or adorned with pearls and jade. Those who violate this shall be examined by the Four Administrators of the soul, and their lifespan reduced by eight hundred years.\n\nHere ends the *Text on Precepts and Regulations for the Three Caverns’ Dharma-Vestments*.",

      "translated_text": "Some manifest with eightfold luminous radiance, their perfect forms resplendent and boundless, their brilliance illuminating far and near, their transformations arising naturally. Others combine nine hues to produce ten thousand distinct glows, or weave dragon-phoenix patterns, or shape flowing mountains and waters—endlessly shifting, beyond all naming. Even the governance of cities and ramparts, palaces and halls, towers and terraces, pavilions and kiosks, grasses and trees, birds and beasts, chariots and carriages, vessels and implements, banners and canopies, curtains and thrones—all ritual instruments—are spontaneously formed, appearing in response to conditions, fundamentally without substance or obstruction, now hidden, now revealed, never constant.\n\nSixth, the sacred vestments of the immortals and perfected ones in the Formless Heavens, along with the Heavenly Emperors: they wear flying-cloud jeweled crowns, nine-hued seamless mantles, kingfisher-dragon patterned skirts, five-colored brocade sashes, and auspicious-luan jade slippers. All arise naturally, manifesting at the thought’s inception. Even their palaces and towers, chariots and carriages, vessels and implements, toys and adornments, gardens and fruits, music and ritual instruments—all necessities—are likewise so.\n\nSeventh, the sacred ranks of immortals in the Form Heavens, along with the Heavenly Emperors: they wear lotus-morning crowns, flying-cloud brocade mantles, rosy-cloud flying skirts, flowing-light brocade sashes, and jade-phoenix patterned slippers. Though possessing form and substance, these are not crafted by the world’s hands but are akin to the natural. Even their dwellings, chariots, ritual instruments—all arise at the heart’s desire, manifesting at thought’s inception, transforming with sovereign ease, unlike the mundane.\n\nEighth, the sacred ranks of immortals in the Desire Heavens: they wear pearl-and-jade crowns, five-cloud mantles, flying-flower kingfisher skirts, flowing-light feathered sashes, and nine-light patterned slippers. All are woven from the realm’s native plants, or obtained from other heavens, or presented by lower immortals—crafted without the toil of the lower worlds. Even their dwellings and halls, chariots and ritual objects, are likewise so.\n\nNinth, the numinous palaces atop mountains, and the immortals, divine officials, and territorial guardians of the Five Marchmounts and famous grotto-heavens: they wear seven-jeweled crowns, nine-light rosy-cloud mantles, flying-green-flower skirts, cloud-brocade sashes, and luan-phoenix patterned slippers. All are fashioned from celestial brocades and silks or the world’s treasures, or refined through transformation—unlike the world’s manufactures. Some ride luan-birds or mount cranes, rein in dragons and tigers, or command white deer, lions, numinous birds, and divine beasts. They traverse flying clouds and cinnabar skies, ride green jade chariots and wheel-borne palanquins, bearing banners and sounding drums, wielding talismans and grasping registers. They move in and out of the human realm, fulfilling desires at heart’s call, appearing in response to karmic conditions. Some are upper-world perfected ones descending to teach in the world, their attire for the occasion no different from mortals; others are lower-world immortals ascending to the heavens, their vestments and mounts matching the higher realms, yet naturally transformed—truly beyond the reckoning of your mortal sentiments.\n\nThe Heavenly Master asked: “Clothing, by nature, is for those with form. Now the highest sages are formless—why then do they don vestments?”\n\nThe Most High replied: “The highest sages, being formless, truly have no need of clothing. Yet when they manifest traces in the human realm, they assume vestments. If they return to the true and revert to the origin, abiding in quiescent spontaneity, even form and shadow are empty—how much more clothing? Though they now show traces, they may be broadly divided into nine grades, but in essence, there are two kinds:\n\nFirst, the clothing of the unclothed: those above the Four Brahmā Heavens, whose wondrous bodies are naturally so, endlessly transforming, fundamentally without form or substance. Now hidden, now revealed, they manifest responsive bodies to guide the lower worlds, temporarily assuming vestments to teach in accord with conditions, adapting their appearance to the realm. Their spiritual efficacy is spontaneous, their transformations unfathomable. This is the unclothed donning clothing—appearing as the common to instruct the common.\n\nSecond, the clothing of the clothed: those below the Three Realms, down to the worthy who have renounced the world, whose forms remain coarse and have yet to merge with the Dao. In their comings and goings, they require the dignity of ritual. Their vestments follow graded observances, resulting in distinctions. There are seven kinds, which must be followed according to the rules. Though kalpas may turn, this Dharma remains unchanged.\n\nFirst, upon entering the Dao’s gate: a plain cap and yellow mantle.\nSecond, in the Orthodox Unity tradition: a lotus-black crown, yellow skirt, and crimson robe.\nThird, in the Dao and Virtue tradition: a yellow robe and black turban.\nFourth, in the Cavern Spirit tradition: a black crown and blue robe.\nFifth, in the Cavern Mystery tradition: a yellow robe and black crown, paired with a yellow skirt. The crown resembles a lotus, either four-sided with two leaves. The robe is three zhang and six chi long, with a body three chi and six cun; for women, two zhang and four chi, with a body two chi and four cun. Sleeves, collars, belts, and borders are made sufficient, with thirty-two strips for the mantle, using two zhang and four chi—twenty-four strips for both men and women.\n\nSixth, in the Cavern Perfection tradition: the robe and mantle use thirty-six chi of purple gauze, their length as in the Cavern Mystery method. The outer layer is blue, with sleeves, collar, and belt made sufficient. The outer has twenty-five strips, the inner fourteen, totaling thirty-nine. The skirt is a flying-green-flower pattern, the crown a lotus-jeweled one, or a four-sided three-leafed crown called the Yuanshi Crown. For women, the robe uses twenty-four chi of purple gauze, two chi and four cun long, with twenty-three strips for the body and sixteen for the sleeves, totaling thirty-nine, paired with a blue-gauze skirt and a flying-cloud phoenix-qi crown.\n\nSeventh, for the Three Caverns’ Dharma-teachers: as in the Highest Clarity vestments, with nine colors added. If wearing five-hued rosy-cloud mountain-water sleeve-mantles and a Yuanshi Jeweled Crown, with jade pendants, ritual tablets, and lion-patterned slippers, these are called Dharma-vestments. They are always attended and protected by heavenly youths and maidens, jade lads and lasses. One must not be careless or err, for all heavens revere them, and all demons submit. Strive diligently in this.\n\nThe Heavenly Master asked: “I wonder, for those in the lower world who inherit and uphold the sagely teachings, how should their Dharma-vestments be?”\n\nThe Most High replied: “For future men and women who cultivate my Dharma, leaving the secular to become monastics, they must uphold the Three Caverns’ talismans, scriptures, and precepts. They should fashion their vestments according to these regulations, following the depth of their scriptures and precepts. They must not be careless or mix them with the attire of immortals and perfected ones.”",

      "translated_text": "One must always maintain purity, burning incense to the left and right, ensuring no defilement or pollution befouls the numinous spirits. The *guan* (crown) means \"observation\"—inwardly observing the body, binding great karmic affinity, so that the hundred spirits of heaven and earth revere and serve one. One must treasure and honor it, safeguarding it with the Dao, restraining the six emotions, curbing greed and desire, emptying the mind and stilling thoughts, washing away worldly toil, and maintaining utmost sincerity in every thought to attain the Dao’s fruit. Outwardly observing things, one sees that none are one’s own; deluded attachment and covetousness disturb the heart. One must observe the wondrous, ever free from desire, for through such observation, virtue adorns the body, emulating the Three Luminaries to illuminate within and without, like the lotus flower dwelling in the world yet unstained.\n\nMoreover, the flower is the beginning of the fruit; the crown, worn upon the head, embodies perfect comprehension without obstruction. The *pèi* (scarf) means \"to drape\"—inwardly, it reveals the liver and heart, free from all impurities; outwardly, it displays and propagates the Dao and virtue, awakening sentient beings. It enables inner and outer to flow unimpeded, benefiting self and others alike, teaching and transforming in due time, delivering all beings, guiding them to take refuge—this is the highest path. The *hè* (robe) means \"to restrain\" and \"to sever\"—inwardly restraining emotions and desires, preventing their outward manifestation, cutting off the six roots to forever extinguish their sprouts; outwardly restraining greed and acquisition, preventing their inward intrusion, severing attachment to things to forever dispel afflictions. With inner and outer restraints severed and both self and others forgotten, one practices the Dao and recites scriptures without fail.\n\nThe *qún* (skirt) means \"multitude\"—inwardly severing the multitude of delusions, outwardly dispelling the multitude of burdens, gathering and transforming all things to enter the One Vehicle, forever escaping the cage of the world, universally liberating all. The crown emulates heaven, bearing the image of the Three Luminaries; the skirt emulates earth, taking the form of the Five Peaks; the scarf models yin and yang, possessing the power of generation and completion. Together, they are called Dharma-vestments, named \"leaving the household.\" Inwardly, they adorn the body, regulating the six roots and three karmas, refining form and spirit; outwardly, they adorn sentient beings, rescuing those in the three evil destinies and five paths, extending salvation to humans and heavens, saints and mortals alike, so all may know what to emulate, venerating the path of luminous conduct.\n\nFurthermore, the vestments of the Heavenly Worthy and perfected immortals uphold scriptures and precepts, teaching and transforming the world. They ensure that master and disciple follow one another, the true Dao flowing unimpeded. Exchanging secular attire for immortal robes, the Dao can clothe all things, and virtue can be emulated by others—through such causes and conditions, they are called Dharma-vestments.\n\nThe Most High said: \"In the past, I wore a sunlit scarf while reciting the *Precious Scripture of the Cavern of Perfection*; a moonlit cloak while reciting the *True Scripture of the Cavern of Mystery*; a starlit scarf while reciting the *Scripture of the Cavern of Divinities*; a nine-colored *li luo* scarf while expounding the *Great Vehicle Scriptures of the Three Caverns*; a five-colored cloud scarf while teaching and transforming the world; a scarf of natural spontaneity while roaming the heavens; a scarf of myriad-transforming clouds while ascending to the Great Luo; and a luminous, jeweled scarf while descending to rescue those in the three evil destinies. I was always attended by two hundred and forty jade lads and maidens who tended to my Dharma-vestments, burning pure incense.\n\nIf a Daoist, one must always prepare their Dharma-vestments, adorning their appearance, bathing and donning the crown and sash to reverently serve the heavenly perfected and teach all beings. One must never temporarily set aside the Dharma-vestments, neglecting dignified conduct, lest non-persons violate the Dharma-vestments.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Master bowed his head, paid homage, and received the teachings. After receiving the Dharma-vestments, he immediately expounded forty-six precepts and prohibitions to transmit to future generations:\n\n1. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not ascend the altar, enter seclusion, perform rituals, make vows, or seek blessings through repentance.\n2. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not approach scriptures and precepts, lecture, recite, read, or expound them.\n3. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not uphold fasts and precepts, receive others’ bows, or partake in food offerings.\n4. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not bow to masters, esteemed elders, or receive disciples’ bows.\n5. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not enter or leave one’s dwelling, travel among the world, or meet with laypeople.\n6. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not perform talismanic incantations, memorials, or petitions.\n7. Without donning Dharma-vestments, one may not pay respects to rulers, parents, or any worldly people.\n8. When resting or at leisure, one must remove the Dharma-vestments.\n9. When bathing or washing, one must remove the Dharma-vestments.\n10. When relieving oneself, one must remove the Dharma-vestments.\n11. In mud, rain, or filth, one must remove the Dharma-vestments.\n12. When serving or attending to masters, elders, or parents, one must not remove the Dharma-vestments.\n13. When inspecting or constructing meritorious works, one must not remove the Dharma-vestments.\n14. When inspecting or preparing vegetarian offerings, flowers, or fruits, one must not remove the Dharma-vestments.\n15. When inspecting or cultivating plants, one must not remove the Dharma-vestments.\n16. Unless in shackles, imprisonment, illness, or suffering, one must not remove the Dharma-vestments.\n17. With unclean hands or feet, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n18. With unclean vessels, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n19. With unclean bedding or mats, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n20. With unclean carriages or palanquins, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n21. When naked or exposed, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n22. In the presence of birds, beasts, insects, or fish, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n23. With foul or putrid breath, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n24. In the presence of non-disciples or non-students, one must not violate the Dharma-vestments.\n25. When first leaving the household, one must first prepare Dharma-vestments.\n26. When receiving scriptures and precepts, one must prepare Dharma-vestments.\n27. When visiting a master to request scriptures, Daoist precepts, or registers, one must don Dharma-vestments.\n28.

Why is this? If one has no eyes, one cannot see the myriad things of heaven and earth, nor discern good from evil or right from wrong. If one has no hands or feet, one cannot move the body or walk near or far, sit or stand. Such a person is incomplete, like a blind being. A Daoist who does not uphold the Dharma-vestments loses ten kinds of reverence and incurs ten kinds of contempt: first, the heavens do not revere them; second, the demonic forces do not revere them; third, spirits and gods do not revere them; fourth, emperors and kings do not revere them; fifth, parents do not revere them; sixth, brothers do not revere them; seventh, sisters do not revere them; eighth, family members do not revere them; ninth, the noble do not revere them; tenth, the lowly do not revere them. They also incur ten kinds of contempt: first, the heavens hold them in contempt; second, demonic forces despise them; third, spirits and gods hold them in contempt; fourth, emperors and kings hold them in contempt; fifth, parents hold them in contempt; sixth, brothers hold them in contempt; seventh, sisters hold them in contempt; eighth, family members hold them in contempt; ninth, the noble hold them in contempt; tenth, the lowly hold them in contempt. Wherever they go in this life, they lose their superior blessings and in past lives are reborn as pigs or dogs. If one safeguards the Dharma-vestments, wherever they go in this life, they receive their due reward. Those reborn among the heavens in past lives—whether men or women—would rather remove their own clothing than remove the Dharma-vestments of one who has left the household; they would rather face a venomous snake than violate the Dharma-vestments of one who has left the household; they would rather sit in a great pit of fire than sit with one who has left the household. If a Daoist discards the Dharma-vestments to pursue worldly glory, their blessings are exhausted. Though they may briefly shine, misfortune will soon arrive, and in past lives they enter the hell of freezing ice, later to be reborn in a naked and exposed body. Why is this? Such a person brings ruin upon themselves.",
