category.\n\n---\n\n**Offering Incense**\n\nThis incense, nurtured by the Dao of Heaven and Earth, refined by the radiance of Sun and Moon.\nIt contains the five-phase essence of life-giving transformation, and its fragrant vapor ascends through the hundred harmonies.\nAll celestial beings rejoice, and the myriad sages attend.\nBurn it in the censer to venerate the supreme Dao treasure, the Revered Emperor of the Mystic Capital, the Ten-Thousand-Longevity Heavenly Sovereign.\nWith this incense offering’s merit, may the imperial vision be steadfast and the holy lifespan boundless.\nMay I earnestly pray for the longevity of the Northern Pole to match the Southern Mountains.\nMay the blessings of the talisman be inscribed upon the Jade Calendar, and the lands of Hua and Yi forever benefit from its pure winds.\n\nThis incense, born from the Heavenly Essence’s brilliance, its roots coiled in the Moon’s Cavern.\nIts mighty fragrance permeates the Nine Heavens, able to return lost souls and restore wandering spirits;\nIts essence flows through the Eight Extremes, granting those who receive it the power to revive the dead.\nBurn it in the censer to venerate the supreme Sutra treasure, the Revered Sovereign of the Great Unity Saving from Suffering.\n\nWith this incense offering’s merit, may all souls in the Ten Hell Realms, the Six Paths of Existence,\nthe Ten Courts of Judgment, and the Nine Abysses of Darkness—\nthose lost in delusion, harm, or wandering between life and death—\nall be liberated from eternal night and the torment of the dark realms,\nand may they universally receive the grace of the Three Treasures\nand rely upon the compassionate Sovereign’s vows.\n\nMay they escape defilement and attain purity.\n**According to the sincerity of each participant, recite the Three Refuges and spread the seat with praise:**\n\"Prostrate before the ineffable Dao, vast compassion that universally saves.\nThe Sovereign’s virtue shines as the Great Compassion,\nand His station is the Revered One of the Eastern Extremity.\nHe pours forth the nectar of warmth to cool afflictions,\nand scatters the enlightened light to illuminate both darkness and clarity.\nHe transforms without leaving traces—His presence is everywhere;\nHe responds to each being’s nature—His compassion reaches all.\n\nIn His fixed response, He manifests boundless compassion;\nIn His boundless compassion, He transcends the Mystic.\nHe observes all as One, and His blessings extend uniformly across the cosmos.\nHe teaches the sutras, manifesting His form in the Ten Directions;\nHe saves suffering souls, liberating them from the Three Realms.\nHe stills the pain of the Seven Paths and Six Emotions,\nand halts the torment of the Three Hell Realms and Nine Nights.\n\nMay the gathered *qi* accumulate merit and enjoy the great blessings of the Heavenly Realm;\nMay all beings follow their karmic inclinations and escape the sufferings of the Hellish Courts.\nMay He guide all lost souls, open the mysteries to all,\nand lead the multitude into the Great Vehicle.\n\nNow, with this ceremony, I humbly offer [Name of the Host] as the master of the fast,\nand present the soul of the departed [Name] to cultivate and exalt the wondrous model.\nWith reverence, I open the Orchid Field (of the Dao),\nand proclaim the grand rituals of the Three Caverns,\nwhile turning the precious treasures of the Ten Heavens.\nI hope the Mystic Vault will descend its discernment,\nand may the soul of the departed [Name] be swiftly liberated and ascend.\n\nMay the departed [Name] now hear the true teachings,\nand instantly escape the realm of suffering;\nMay he personally receive the blessings,\nand attain the path of the Immortals.\n\nFurther, may all souls bound in the dark prisons,\nand those who harbor grudges against the living,\nall be saved and freed from the cycle of rebirth.\nNow, I request all assembled allies\nto each bring their sincerest intentions into the chamber.\nWith pure resolve and tranquil heart,\nand upright body and focused mind,\nfollow the sutra’s law in sequence.\n\n**When entering

the crooked offices.\nWithout Your boundless creation,\nit would be difficult to attain Your profound grace.\n\nWe pray that Your green palanquin and elixir carriage come to inspect the gathering of

The devout assembly, in pious reverence, now humbly submits its petition.\n\nWe request the Sage to appear, scatter sacred flowers, and ascend the platform to recite the **ninth cycle** of the scripture. As we hear, the True Teachings flow forth, illuminating the dharma-lamp upon the darkened crossroads; the Auspicious Name resounds, guiding the Compassionate Vessel across the Sea of Suffering. All beings, human and celestial, are universally delivered, and all return to the True Dao.\n\nNow, as we ascend to the scripture seat, voices unite in harmony. We chant and recite the wondrous scripture, extolling the Glorious Name. We offer as the host of the **vegetarian ritual** (*zhāizhǔ*), providing sustenance to the departed spirits. Relying upon the wondrous power of auspicious causes, we expunge the sins of countless kalpas.\n\nThus, we avoid the scrutiny of the **Divine Authorities of the Upper Realm** (*shàngfāng kǎoduì*), and directly proceed to the **Land of Seven Treasures and Azure Celestial Realm** (*qībǎo zǐxiāo guó*). The devout assembly, in pious reverence, chants in unison.\n\nWhen the scripture is complete, we once more visit the **Divine Authorities of the Upper Realm**, humbly presenting our petition. We pray that the **Formless and Selfless** (*wúmíng wúwǒ*) may guide all living beings; that the **Unwayward and Unwasteful** (*bùmí bùhuāng*) may awaken them to the True Dao. The subtleties are unfathomable even across countless kalpas, yet with sincere devotion, we attain the power of **mysterious communication** (*gǎntōng*).\n\nThe previous devout assembly, with voices united in harmony, has chanted the wondrous scripture, extolling the Glorious Name, completing the nine cycles. We offer as the host of the vegetarian ritual, providing sustenance to the departed spirits, and guide them to the **Immortal Realm** (*xiān jiè*). We humbly wish that the **darkness of the soul** (*huǒyì*) may be purified into the **Clear Pavilion** (*qīngshǔ*), and the **sword-trees** (*jiànshù*) transformed into **auspicious carriages** (*yuè*). May the spirits depart from the **Netherworld** (*yōutú*), ascending to the **Azure Celestial Realm** (*bìluò*).\n\nAll the **True Talismans of the Highest Sage** (*Tàishàng zhēnfú*), we shall now solemnly proclaim. Proclaiming the talismans, opening the **passages** (*guān*), and escorting the Sage, we kneel and pray to the **Divine Authorities of the Lower Realm** (*xiàfāng zhēnhuáng*).\n\nWith deepest sincerity and humility, we kneel, bow, and prostrate ourselves twice. We pray to the **True Sovereign of the Lower Realm** (*xiàfāng zhēnhuáng*), the **Divine Lord of the Cavernous Mysteries** (*Dòngshén tiānzūn*), the **Sage of the Lower Reaches** (*xiàxiāng jiùkǔ*), the **True Personhood Child** (*zhēnrén tóngzi*), and the **Formless Devout Assembly** (*wúyàng zhēnzhòng*). With reverent gaze upon the Sacred Compassion, we humbly beseech Your piercing insight.\n\nWe pray that the **vast expanse of the world** (*fāngyuè*) bears all things with boundless faith, and that the **Great Sage’s teachings** (*Dàxiān jiào*) are imparted without prejudice; that the **profound virtue** (*shòudé*) ensures stability and that the **vast foundation** (*hóngjī*) is laid eternally firm. All benefit from the Dao’s power, and all achieve the **wondrous divine functions** (*shén gōng*).\n\nThe scripture is proclaimed to deliver all beings in the **Nine Abysses** (*jiǔ quán*), and the teachings are now fully heard in **ten cycles** (*shí biàn*). All receive the merit and attain liberation, ascending to the sacred and transcending the mundane.\n\nWe dare to petition the **Divine Authorities** (*língsī*), thus issuing talismans to the **curved halls** (*qūfǔ*). Not relying upon mere creation’s grandeur, yet how can we grasp the profound grace?\n\nWe humbly pray that the **jade carriage and crimson palanquin** (*lǜshèng dān yú*) may come to witness the assembly of the **Ten True Ones** (*shí zhēn*); the **jade cases and treasure scrolls** (*lánghán bǎojiè*), to encompass the merit of the ten cycles.\n\n(Your humble servant) dares to trespass upon the Sacred Majesty, with deepest sincerity beseeching and praying. The devout assembly, in pious reverence, now humbly submits its petition.\n\nWe request the Sage to appear, scatter sacred flowers, and ascend the platform to recite the **tenth cycle** of the scripture. As we hear, the **Eastern Extremity’s Benevolent Father** (*Dōngjí cífù*), the **Venerable Lord of Azure Mysteries** (*Qīngxuǎn lǎojūn*), pours forth the **dharma-rain** (*fǎyǔ*) to nourish all beings, and spreads the **Compassionate Clouds** (*cíyún*) to cover all realms. The grace extends to the **Nine Earths** (*jiǔdì*), and the blessings reach the **Ten Directions** (*shífāng*).\n\nNow, as we ascend to the scripture seat, voices unite in harmony. We chant and recite the wondrous scripture, extolling the Glorious Name. We offer as the host of the vegetarian ritual, providing sustenance to the departed spirits. Relying upon the wondrous power of auspicious causes, we expunge the sins of countless kalpas.\n\nThus, we avoid the scrutiny of the **Divine Authorities of the Lower Realm** (*xiàfāng kǎoduì*), and directly proceed to the **Pure Land of Splendid Ornamentation** (*jìngtǔ zhuāngyán guó*). The devout assembly, in pious reverence, chants in unison.\n\nWhen the scripture is complete, we once more visit the **Divine Authorities of the Lower Realm**, humbly presenting our petition. We pray that the **Supreme True Teachings** (*shàngzhuāng zhēnjiào*) are now fully revealed, and the Dao’s power pervades all.\n\nWondrous indeed are the **Three Caverns’ Scriptures** (*sāndòng jīng*); supreme is the **might of virtue and spirit** (*wēishén lì*). It reaches the **Clear Pavilion of the Highest Realm** (*qīngdū zǐfǔ*) above and descends to the **Netherworld’s Black Soil and Yellow Springs** (*hēirǎng huáng quán*) below. All are granted transcendence, and all receive the blessings.\n\nThe previous devout assembly, with voices united in harmony, has chanted the wondrous scripture, extolling the Glorious Name, completing the ten cycles. We offer as the host of the vegetarian ritual, providing sustenance to the departed spirits, and guide them to the **Immortal Realm**.\n\nWe humbly wish to gather the **refined essence** (*wěi qì*), achieve the **mystic power** (*fǎng gōng*), and ascend to the **True Dao** (*zhēndào*). Though transcending the **Three Realms** (*sānjiè*) is difficult, we may directly ascend to the **Heaven of Primordial Origin** (*Yuánshǐ tiān*).\n\nAll the **True Talismans of the Highest Sage**, we shall now solemnly proclaim. Proclaiming the talismans, opening the passages, and escorting the Sage, we **chant the scripture in awe**.\n\nThe **Scripture** is the direct path, pointing to its way and returning to it.\n\nPracticing the Dao and cultivating the True, saving the living and guiding the dead—unobstructed and boundless in all directions. With this direct path,\nwhen applied to the **refined essence** (*jīng*), one can reverse the flow and enter the brain.\nWhen the brain is full, the body grows strong—this is the method of **root-searching without leakage** and **preserving life for longevity**, the marvel of those who practice as Earth Immortals.\n\nWhen applied to the **spirit** (*shén*), one attains inner vision and reversed hearing, reaching the utmost emptiness and tranquility, with purity fully established within. Heavenly light shines radiant—this is the marvel of those who practice as Spirit Immortals.\n\nWhen applied to the **qi**, one can draw the **flying roots** of the Great Compass, inhaling and exhaling the **Primordial Sovereign’s** heavenly breath.\nThe **qi** emerges from **Kan** and enters **Kun**, forming a **formless body**—known as the **Supreme Heavenly Venerable**—this is the marvel of those who practice as Heavenly Immortals.\n\nPracticing this path:\nTo abandon **emotions and desires** is to sever the root of birth and death;\nTo cast off **deceit and falsehood** is to ascend to the gates of myriad wonders;\nTo transcend all **things** is to surpass the world and emerge from dust.\n\nPracticing this path at the time of **yang vitality** (*yángshēng*), one turns the **Celestial Pivot** (*Xuánxī*), working within the **single breath** to cause **golden essence** to flow upon the crown and **silver waves** to surge open.\nWith the brain now full, one enters the **accumulation of merit** (*gōngdé*).\nWater flows through, the nose opens, the mouth returns to the throat and merges with the **Yellow Court** (*Huángtíng*), refining the **inner elixir** (*zhōng dān*).\nWhen practiced for long,\nthe marrow fills, the bones harden, and the hundred limbs grow firm and sealed—\n**no cold, no heat, no sickness or affliction** touches one.\nThis is the **manifestation of Earth Immortals**.\n\nPracticing this path,\none maintains inner vision and reversed hearing,\nguarding the **True One** (*yīzhēn*) within the **Upper Field of Yellow Chamber** (*Shàngtián Huángfáng*).\nNever does it depart, even for a moment.\nThough engaging with affairs and using the body,\none’s **mind remains ever warm** (*yīwēn*), warm within the Yellow Court.\nIn stillness, one guards constantly;\nIn motion, one remains ever serene.\nSerene, one becomes clear;\nClear, one returns to the Upper Field.\nAfter long practice, one attains **Great Tranquility** (*Tàidìng*), then **white light** and **round symbol** radiate, dazzling the chamber.\nWhen someone approaches me,\nI know them first—\nthis is the **manifestation of Spirit Immortals**.\n\nPracticing this path,\none **ingests qi** (*fú qì*) at dawn,\nand **closes the breath** (*bìxī*) at night, in stillness.\nIngesting qi means\n**consuming the essence of Great Harmony** and the **vitality of the Two Scenes** (*liǎng jǐng*).\nWhen **heavenly qi** enters the body, the hundred spirits become **responsive**.\nWith **spirit guiding qi**, the qi **lingers long**.\nHaving obtained its breath,\none accumulates it again and again—\n**accumulating water forms seas**,\n**accumulating qi forms spirit**.\nSpirit condenses and forms the embryo;\na body grows within the body—\nthis is the **manifestation of Heavenly Immortals**.\n\nObserving my **heart**,\nas vast as the **Great Void**.\nObserving my **body**,\nas boundless as the **Great Emptiness**.\nWandering through all things,\nall are **illusion and transformation**,\nultimately returning to **annihilation**.\nNot one thing or deed\ncan shake my **heart**.\n\nMy **spirit** is ever serene—\nserene, I do not know\nthe **Great Emptiness** as *me*,\nnor *me* as the Great Emptiness—\nthis is the **marvelous response of the path**.\n\nThus, practicing this path,\nwith **idle resolve** and **neglected merit**,\none extinguishes the **Great Dao**—\nit will not succeed.\n\nObserving this path,\n**common folk** cannot practice it\nand thus fail to reveal its marvels.\nCommon folk without this path\ncannot verify its **practitioners’ merits**—\nits **effects and applications**.\n\nThe **Dao** is the **essence** of the Scripture;\nThe Scripture is the **application** of the Dao.\nWhen essence and application are both forgotten,\nthe Dao **becomes luminous**.\n\nThus, one forgets what is forgotten,\nyet does not forget the forgotten itself.\n\nRepeating the **gāthā** again:\n*\"To become an Immortal or a Buddha—origins differ,*\n*Yet all unite in one path, marvelous and complete.*\n*Piercing these knots of illusion,*\n*No existence, no nonexistence—*\n*Yet nonexistence returns to existence.*\n**Threefold Hearing of the Scripture**,\n**Yellow Arrow Ritual for Saving Suffering**,\n**Tenfold Vegetarian Offerings**—\nthe **Ritual of Turning the Scripture** is now complete.\"*",

      "translated_text": "---\n\n(Your humble servant) dares to trespass upon the Sacred Majesty, with deepest sincerity beseeching and praying. The devout assembly, in pious reverence, now humbly submits its petition.\n\nWe request the Sage to appear, scatter sacred flowers, and ascend the platform to recite the **ninth cycle** of the scripture. As we hear, the True Teachings flow forth, illuminating the dharma-lamp upon the darkened crossroads; the Auspicious Name resounds, guiding the Compassionate Vessel across the Sea of Suffering. All beings, human and celestial, are universally delivered, and all return to the True Dao.\n\nNow, as we ascend to the scripture seat, voices unite in harmony. We chant and recite the wondrous scripture, extolling the Glorious Name. We offer as the host of the **vegetarian ritual** (*zhāizhǔ*), providing sustenance to the departed spirits. Relying upon the wondrous power of auspicious causes, we expunge the sins of countless kalpas.\n\nThus, we avoid the scrutiny of the **Divine Authorities of the Upper Realm** (*shàngfāng kǎoduì*), and directly proceed to the **Land of Seven Treasures and Azure Celestial Realm** (*qībǎo zǐxiāo guó*). The devout assembly, in pious reverence, chants in unison.\n\nWhen the scripture is complete, we once more visit the **Divine Authorities of the Upper Realm**, humbly presenting our petition. We pray that the **Formless and Selfless** (*wúmíng wúwǒ*) may guide all living beings; that the **Unwayward and Unwasteful** (*bùmí bùhuāng*) may awaken them to the True Dao. The subtleties are unfathomable even across countless kalpas, yet with sincere devotion, we attain the power of **mysterious communication** (*gǎntōng*).\n\nThe previous devout assembly, with voices united in harmony, has chanted the wondrous scripture, extolling the Glorious Name, completing the nine cycles. We offer as the host of the vegetarian ritual, providing sustenance to the departed spirits, and guide them to the **Immortal Realm** (*xiān jiè*). We humbly wish that the **darkness of the soul** (*huǒyì*) may be purified into the **Clear Pavilion** (*qīngshǔ*), and the **sword-trees** (*jiànshù*) transformed into **auspicious carriages** (*yuè*). May the spirits depart from the **Netherworld** (*yōutú*), ascending to the **Azure Celestial Realm** (*bìluò*).\n\nAll the **True Talismans of the Highest Sage** (*Tàishàng zhēnfú*), we shall now solemnly proclaim. Proclaiming the talismans, opening the **passages** (*guān*), and escorting the Sage, we kneel and pray to the **Divine Authorities of the Lower Realm** (*xiàfāng zhēnhuáng*).\n\nWith deepest sincerity and humility, we kneel, bow, and prostrate ourselves twice. We pray to the **True Sovereign of the Lower Realm** (*xiàfāng zhēnhuáng*), the **Divine Lord of the Cavernous Mysteries** (*Dòngshén tiānzūn*), the **Sage of the Lower Reaches** (*xiàxiāng jiùkǔ*), the **True Personhood Child** (*zhēnrén tóngzi*), and the **Formless Devout Assembly** (*wúyàng zhēnzhòng*). With reverent gaze upon the Sacred Compassion, we humbly beseech Your piercing insight.\n\nWe pray that the **vast expanse of the world** (*fāngyuè*) bears all things with boundless faith, and that the **Great Sage’s teachings** (*Dàxiān jiào*) are imparted without prejudice; that the **profound virtue** (*shòudé*) ensures stability and that the **vast foundation** (*hóngjī*) is laid eternally firm. All benefit from the Dao’s power, and all achieve the **wondrous divine functions** (*shén gōng*).\n\nThe scripture is proclaimed to deliver all beings in the **Nine Abysses** (*jiǔ quán*), and the teachings are now fully heard in **ten cycles** (*shí biàn*). All receive the merit and attain liberation, ascending to the sacred and transcending the mundane.\n\nWe dare to petition the **Divine Authorities** (*língsī*), thus issuing talismans to the **curved halls** (*qūfǔ*). Not relying upon mere creation’s grandeur, yet how can we grasp the profound grace?\n\nWe humbly pray that the **jade carriage and crimson palanquin** (*lǜshèng dān yú*) may come to witness the assembly of the **Ten True Ones** (*shí zhēn*); the **jade cases and treasure scrolls** (*lánghán bǎojiè*), to encompass the merit of the ten cycles.\n\n(Your humble servant) dares to trespass upon the Sacred Majesty, with deepest sincerity beseeching and praying. The devout assembly, in pious reverence, now humbly submits its petition.\n\nWe request the Sage to appear, scatter sacred flowers, and ascend the platform to recite the **tenth cycle** of the scripture. As we hear, the **Eastern Extremity’s Benevolent Father** (*Dōngjí cífù*), the **Venerable Lord of Azure Mysteries** (*Qīngxuǎn lǎojūn*), pours forth the **dharma-rain** (*fǎyǔ*) to nourish all beings, and spreads the **Compassionate Clouds** (*cíyún*) to cover all realms. The grace extends to the **Nine Earths** (*jiǔdì*), and the blessings reach the **Ten Directions** (*shífāng*).\n\nNow, as we ascend to the scripture seat, voices unite in harmony. We chant and recite the wondrous scripture, extolling the Glorious Name. We offer as the host of the vegetarian ritual, providing sustenance to the departed spirits. Relying upon the wondrous power of auspicious causes, we expunge the sins of countless kalpas.\n\nThus, we avoid the scrutiny of the **Divine Authorities of the Lower Realm** (*xiàfāng kǎoduì*), and directly proceed to the **Pure Land of Splendid Ornamentation** (*jìngtǔ zhuāngyán guó*). The devout assembly, in pious reverence, chants in unison.\n\nWhen the scripture is complete, we once more visit the **Divine Authorities of the Lower Realm**, humbly presenting our petition. We pray that the **Supreme True Teachings** (*shàngzhuāng zhēnjiào*) are now fully revealed, and the Dao’s power pervades all.\n\nWondrous indeed are the **Three Caverns’ Scriptures** (*sāndòng jīng*); supreme is the **might of virtue and spirit** (*wēishén lì*). It reaches the **Clear Pavilion of the Highest Realm** (*qīngdū zǐfǔ*) above and descends to the **Netherworld’s Black Soil and Yellow Springs** (*hēirǎng huáng quán*) below. All are granted transcendence, and all receive the blessings.\n\nThe previous devout assembly, with voices united in harmony, has chanted the wondrous scripture, extolling the Glorious Name, completing the ten cycles. We offer as the host of the vegetarian ritual, providing sustenance to the departed spirits, and guide them to the **Immortal Realm**.\n\nWe humbly wish to gather the **refined essence** (*wěi qì*), achieve the **mystic power** (*fǎng gōng*), and ascend to the **True Dao** (*zhēndào*). Though transcending the **Three Realms** (*sānjiè*) is difficult, we may directly ascend to the **Heaven of Primordial Origin** (*Yuánshǐ tiān*).\n\nAll the **True Talismans of the Highest Sage**, we shall now solemnly proclaim.
