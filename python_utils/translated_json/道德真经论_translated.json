  "full_translation": "**The Treatise on the *Dao De* Classic**\n\n**Title:** *Treatise on the Dao De Classic*. Annotated by Sima Guang (宋司马光注). Four volumes. Source text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), under the category of *Divine Essence and Supreme Purity* (洞神都) *Jewel Precepts* (玉诀类). The original text lacks chapter titles; these are added according to Wang Bi’s (王弼) version.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One of the *Treatise on the Dao De Classic* – Sima Guang’s Annotations**\n\nThe Grand Historian (太史公) said: The *Laozi* composed a book in two parts, upper and lower, expounding the meaning of *Dao* and *De*. Later generations, taking the opening phrases of each section, named the upper part *Dao* and the lower part *De*. But *Dao* and *De* are inseparable, and so I retain the original title.\n\n**Chapter One**\n*Dao* that can be spoken of is not the Eternal *Dao*;\nA name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.\nThe vulgar speak of *Dao* as a subtle essence,\nIndescribable, beyond all naming.\nBut the *Laozi* holds this otherwise:\n*Dao* can indeed be spoken of—\nYet it is not the *Dao* that common folk speak of.\nA name can indeed be given—\nYet it is not the Name that common folk give.\nWhat common folk call *Dao* is but a fixation on things;\nWhat they call a Name is but a rigid, entangling distinction.\nThe Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of all forms,\nYet their origin must lie in the Formless—\nHence the Nameless is called their beginning.\nAll things arise through form,\nYet their creation must depend on the Formed—\nHence the Named is called their mother.\n\nThe Formless is ever-present,\nTo behold its wonders.\nThe Formed is ever-present,\nTo grasp its limits.\n*Limits* (徼) refers to boundaries.\nOnce things are Formed, the Formless seems to have no use.\nYet the Sage retains the Formless without abandoning it,\nTo exhaust the subtleties of divine transformation.\nIf the Formless is so precious,\nThen the Formed seems to have no use.\nYet the Sage retains the Formed without abandoning it,\nTo establish the boundaries of all affairs.\nIf one were to discard the Formed and cling only to the Formless,\nIt would drift and scatter, lacking all boundaries—\nThus the Formed is advantageous, the Formless is instrumental.\nThese two are of the same origin but different names,\nBoth called *Xuan* (玄).\n*Xuan* again, *Xuan*—\nThe gateway to all wonders.\n*Xuan* is neither Formed nor Formless,\nThe ultimate subtlety.\n\n**Chapter Two**\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—\nThen it is no longer beauty;\nAll know goodness as goodness—\nThen it is no longer goodness.\nBeauty and goodness have paths,\nKnown by all—\nYet they are not the utmost of beauty and goodness.\nThus the Formless and the Formed give rise to each other,\nThe difficult and the easy complete one another,\nThe long and the short define each other,\nThe high and the low complement each other,\nThe sounds and the voices harmonize,\nThe before and the after follow in sequence.\nAll things that have traces and forms\nMust necessarily be unequal.\nUnequal, they contend;\nContend, they fall into disorder;\nDisorder, they reach exhaustion—\nHence the Sage does not value them.\n\nTherefore the Sage acts in non-doing,\nAnd employs wisdom as Yu (禹) directed the waters—\nMoving where there is no obstruction.\nHe teaches without speaking;\nHis person is upright—\nAnd without commands, things are done.\nAll things arise, yet he does not claim them;\nHis mind issues forth—\nYet things may not yet respond.\nWhen things arrive, he responds—\nWithout refusal or rejection.\nHe gives birth yet does not possess,\nNurturing all things without appropriating them for himself.\nHe acts yet does not rely upon it,\nFor the Sage cannot fully refrain from action under Heaven—\nYet he does not depend on it as his own strength.\nWhen his work is done, he does not dwell upon it.\nHe does not boast—\nThus none contend with him for ability;\nHe does not claim credit—\nThus none contend with him for achievement.\n\n**Chapter Three**\nDo not exalt the virtuous—\nSo the people will not contend.\nYet the virtuous cannot be ignored—\nAll know this.\nBut when its excesses are considered,\nContention for reputation brings only disorder—\nThus the *Laozi* corrects this, urging people to value substance over name.\n\nDo not prize difficult-to-obtain wealth—\nSo the people will not become thieves.\nDo not display what is desirable—\nSo the heart will not be disturbed.\nTherefore the Sage’s governance:\nEmpties their desires—\nSo the people have no cravings for gain.\nFills their bellies—\nSo they have enough to eat.\nWeakens their ambitions—\nSo they dare not contend or seize.\nStrengthens their bones—\nSo they labor with vigor.\nEver keeps the people in ignorance and free from desire,\nContent with their food, pleased with their garments—\nUnaware of anything beyond their needs.\nThus even the wise dare not act.\nNone respond to him.\nIf he acts in non-doing,\nNothing remains ungoverned.\nIf he governs them to reach non-doing—\nThis is his way.\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe *Dao* is vast yet used, yet never full;\nDeep as the ancestral source of all things.\nFathomless, it is ever the master of things.\nIt blunts their sharpness—\nFor the *Dao* abhors exposed ferocity.\nIt unravels their entanglements—\nFor the *Dao* despises chaotic affairs.\nIt subdues their brilliance—\nFor the *Dao* deems resplendent display contemptible.\nIt aligns with their dust—\nFor the *Dao* values the humble and defiled.\nSerene, it seems as if it exists—\nYet serene and unmoving, it appears both present and absent.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nYet it precedes the Emperor.\nThis speaks of its birth before Heaven and Earth,\nNone can rival its antiquity.\n\n**Chapter Five**\nHeaven and Earth are not kind,\nYet they treat all things as sacrificial straw-dogs;\nStraw-dogs are ritual implements—\nValued before use, discarded after.\nHeaven produces the five *qi* (村),\nYet its power is exhausted and flawed—\nThis resembles unkindness.\nThe Sage is not kind,\nYet he treats the people as sacrificial straw-dogs.\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nIs it not like the *tuqiao* (橐钥)?\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever producing more.\n*Tu* (橐) means to thrust aside;\n*Qiao* (钥) means the *yuelü* (乐钥) instrument.\nWithin the *tuqiao* lies a hollow, boundless space—\nThus it is empty and cannot be exhausted or bent;\nThus it moves and cannot be drained.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion,\nBetter to hold fast to the center.\nIf one truly holds to the center,\nSilence itself will be believed.\n\n**Chapter Six**\nThe *qi* of the Valley does not die—\nThe center is hollow, hence called *Valley* (谷);\nFathomless, hence called *Divine* (神).\nHeaven and Earth have limits,\nYet the *Dao* is limitless—\nHence it is said to not die.\nThis is called the *Xuan* Mother.\n\n**Chapter Seven**\nThe *Xuan* is subtle—\nIts marvel lies in its profundity.\nThe *Pìn* is the mother of all things.\nThe *Xuan Pìn* Gate—\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nThrough it, Heaven and Earth give birth.\nEndless as silk,\nYet never exhausted in use.\nFaint yet unbroken,\nNow absent, now present—\nNothing is unused,\nYet never labored.\n\n**Chapter Eight**\nThe highest virtue resembles water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend;\nIt dwells where others abhor—\nFor people despise the lowly.\nThus it approaches the *Dao*.\nThe *Dao* has no equal to water,\nHence it is said to approach it.\nTo dwell is to occupy the low ground,\nTo be mindful is to be deep,\nTo give is to be kind,\nTo speak is to be trustworthy,\nTo govern is to purify,\nTo act is to fulfill,\nTo manage is to adapt to round and square,\nTo move is to be timely—\nSolidifying when still, floating when stirred.\nOnly by not contending\nIs there no blame.\nContention is the end of all things.\nIf one does not vie with others,\nNone will resent or hate them—\nWhat fault could there be?\nThus it is especially praised.\n\n**Chapter Nine**\nTo rely on fullness is not as good as stopping in time;\nTo rely on power, rank, talent, or virtue and become arrogant\nIs not as good as having none.\nTo probe and sharpen is not long-lasting.\nTo probe the nature of things and sharpen one’s demands\nWill inevitably lead to loss.\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them;\nWealth and honor bring arrogance,\nAnd one invites their own ruin.\nWhen the work is done and the name is complete,\nWithdraw—\nThis is the *Dao* of Heaven.\nThe four seasons cycle endlessly;\nWhen the work is complete, it moves on.\n\n**Chapter Ten**\nNurturing the *yíngpò* (魄) and embracing the One—\nCan one remain undivided?\nFocusing the *qi* to attain softness—\nCan one be like an infant?\nPurifying and gazing into the depths—\nCan one be without blemish?\nLoving the people and governing the state—\nCan one act without doing?\nThose who love the people well\nLet them live freely, guiding without harming.\nThose who govern the state well\nTrust in their capacities, achieving without labor.\nOpening and closing the Heavenly Gate—\nCan one be receptive as the female?\nIlluminating and all-pervading—\nCan one be without knowing?\nWith wisdom and insight,\nGuard with simplicity.\nTo give birth and nurture—\nTo give birth without possessing,\nTo act without relying,\nTo grow without dominating—\nThis is called *Xuan* virtue.\n*Cháng* means to know what is beneath;\n*Zǎi* means to control and cut.\n\n「Thirty spokes converge at one hub—\nWhen there is nothing there, the use of the wheel is realized;\nIts hollowness within receives all things,\nThus it can govern the multitude with the few.\nClay is shaped into vessels—\nWhen there is nothing there, the use of the vessels is realized;\n*Bī* is harmony, *zhí* is earth.\nPiercing doors and windows to make a room—\nWhen there is nothing there, the use of the room is realized.\nThus, having is for utility,\nBut nothingness is for function.\n\n*Lǐ* reaches to the point of no form,\nMusic reaches to the point of no sound,\nLaw reaches to the point of no punishment,\nThen the Dao’s function is revealed.\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deaf the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate;\n*Shuāng* is loss.\nGalloping hunts and wild chases drive the heart mad,\nRare treasures cause erratic conduct.\nAll these harm the inner from the outer.\nThus the Sage acts for the belly, not the eyes,\nAnd so discards the former to embrace the latter.\nThe belly guards the inner,\nThe eyes covet the outer.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\n\nFavor and disgrace are like sudden alarms,\nGreat calamities are like personal threats.\nWhat is meant by \"favor and disgrace are like sudden alarms\"?\nFavor is lowly—\nGaining it is like alarm,\nLosing it is like alarm;\nThis is called \"favor and disgrace are like sudden alarms.\"\nFor the *shì* (gentleman/scholar),\n*Dao* and *virtue* are held above,\nTitles and rewards below.\nThe upper brings honor,\nThe lower brings humiliation.\nThe common people thus cling to their disgrace,\nAnd when they lose it, they tremble;\nWhen they gain it, they weep.\n\nWhat is meant by \"great calamities are like personal threats\"?\nMy great calamity comes from my having a body.\nBecause I have this body,\nWhen I am without a body,\nI return to nature.\nWhat calamity do I have then?\nColor, sound, flavor, and rare treasures—\nThese are the great calamities of the body.\nThe common people thus blame them more than their own bodies,\nFor they pursue the outer and forget the inner.\n\nThus, the Sage who unifies through yielding\nCan entrust himself with the world;\nThe Sage who loves the world with himself\nCan be entrusted with the world.\nHe who is entrusted with the world,\nThe world also entrusts him with great value.\nHe who loves and benefits the world,\nThe world also loves and benefits him.\n*Jīn* (gold), *wèi* (silk), *xù* (jewelry), and *huái* (rare goods)—\nThese cheapen and destroy the world,\nYet the world holds them in high regard.\nThus the Sage’s love and regard for the world\nAre the same as his love and regard for himself—\nSo entrusted with great responsibility,\nHe is certain to uphold it.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\nGazing without naming is called *yí* (equanimity/evenness).」\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\nTo see without naming is called *yí*—formless.\nTo hear without naming is called *xī*—voiceless.\nTo grasp without obtaining is called *wēi*—formless.\nThese three states—\nThey cannot be defined in words, so they merge into one,\nAll returning to *wú* (nothingness).\nThe highest of them is not bright,\nThe lowest is not dark.\nBrightness is clarity.\nThe Dao ascends like fine sand, giving birth to all things yet unseen.\nThe Dao descends, causing all things to rest yet never perishing.\nIt is *shéngshéng*—endless yet nameless.\n*Shéngshéng*, the appearance of boundless extension,\nIs called \"having\" or \"having not\"—\nBoth are forced names.\nReturning again to the formless.\nThis is called the *zhuàng* (form) of no form,\nThe *xiàng* (image) of no thing.\nIf one speaks of nothingness without error,\nThen all things arise from it.\nIf one speaks of existence without error,\nThen one does not see its shape.\nThe image of no thing is called *hūhuǎng*—\nSometimes appearing, sometimes not.\nApproach it, and one does not see its beginning;\nExamine it, and one does not see its end.\nHold fast to the Dao of antiquity\nTo govern the existence of the present.\nThe Dao of antiquity is *wú* (nothingness).\nTo know the beginning of antiquity is called *dàojì*—\nThe Dao is measured by nothingness.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\nThe ancients who excelled in *shì* (official service/conduct)\nWere subtle, mysterious, and profound—\nDeep beyond comprehension.\nBecause they were incomprehensible,\nTheir actions were forced to appear in outward forms:\nOnly their external appearances were acceptable.\nCautious as one crossing a river in winter,\nWary as if fearing four neighbors,\nSolemn as a guest,\nDissolving like ice about to melt,\nThick as uncarved wood,\nVast as a valley,\nMixed as if standing alone.\nAll these were the outward forms of those who had the Dao.\nWho could muddy and then slowly clarify?\nWho could settle and then endure, slowly growing?\nThose who preserve this Dao\nDo not wish to overflow.\nBecause they do not overflow,\nThey can be exhausted yet renewed again.\nVirtue comes from humility.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\nWhen the utmost emptiness is attained,\nAnd steadfast stillness is preserved—\nAll things rise together, and I observe their return.\nAll movement of things\nMust inevitably return to stillness.\nThe myriad things, teeming and diverse,\nEach return to their root.\nThings arise from the formless,\nAnd return to the formless.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nStillness, when divided, is called *fùmíng* (restoration of vital order).\nWhen things are still, they follow the *tiānming* (Heaven’s decree).\nRestoration of *míng* (vital order) is called constancy.\nWho can defy Heaven?\nKnowing constancy is called clarity.\nNeither movement nor stillness loses its proper time.\nIgnorant of constancy, reckless action brings ruin.\nTo act contrary to principle.\nKnowing constancy is called tolerance;\nEmptiness and stillness embrace all without exclusion.\nTolerance is impartiality—\nNo favoritism, no partiality.\nImpartiality is sovereign—\nAll under Heaven turn toward it.\nSovereignty is Heaven—\nAligning with Heaven’s *dé* (virtue/power).\nHeaven is the Dao—\nHeaven follows the Dao.\nThe Dao endures eternally—\nBoundless.\nDeath does not bring peril.\nIn emptiness, there is no resistance;\nIn stillness, no invasion—\nWhat danger could there be?\n\n**Chapter Eighteen**\nThe Sage of Highest Virtue\nIs known to the lower ranks as if he existed,\nYet none know his imperial power.\nThe next kind\nIs cherished and praised—\nYet leaves traces.\nThe next kind\nIs feared—\nForced submission through coercion.\nThe next kind\nIs scorned.\nBoth威 (*wēi*, coercive power) and 德 (*dé*, virtue/power) are lost.\nWhen trust is insufficient, distrust arises.\nEven more so, words must be honored.\nEven more so, actions must be sincere.\nTo exhaustively fulfill one’s words\nIs impossible to achieve completely.\nWhen the work is done and the task accomplished,\nThe people say, *“It was as if by nature.”*\nThe sun rises, and they labor;\nThe sun sets, and they rest.\nThey drink from dug wells,\nEat from tilled fields.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\nWhen the Dao is abandoned,\nRen and *yì* (righteous conduct) arise;\nThe Daoist embodies *rén* and *yì* as essence,\nPractices them with sincerity,\nYet does not display them outwardly.\nThus, when the Dao is practiced,\n*Rén* and *yì* are concealed;\nWhen the Dao is abandoned,\n*Rén* and *yì* become prominent.\nWisdom and insight emerge,\nAnd great deceit follows;\nThe petty rely on goodness to do evil.\nFamily bonds fracture, yet filial piety arises;\nThe state falls into chaos, yet loyal ministers appear.\nFamily bonds—father, son, brothers, husband, wife.\nIf family bonds are naturally harmonious,\nAnd the state naturally governed,\nThen filial piety, loyalty, and ministers\nAre unknown in their proper place.\nFish cannot forget one another in rivers and lakes,\nAnd thus the virtue of mutual nourishment arises.\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\nAbandon the Sage, discard wisdom—\nThe people benefit a hundredfold.\nSages and wisdom were meant to benefit the people,\nBut in their later corruption,\nThey are sometimes used to harm them—\nThus Laozi corrects this.\nAbandon *rén* and *yì*—\nThe people return to filial piety.\nFilial piety is the root of *rén* and *yì*.\nAbandon artifice, discard profit—\nThieves and robbers vanish.\nSkill in benefiting the people is the original intent of sages and wisdom.\nThieves and robbers merely steal skill for selfish gain.\nThese three—\nThough used for ornamentation, they are insufficient—\nThus they must be anchored.\n*Shǔ* (anchor/establish).\nSages, wisdom, *rén*, *yì*, skill, and profit—\nAll were ancient virtuous paths,\nBut later generations used them merely for show,\nTheir inner sincerity lacking—\nThus these three become mere names, losing their substance.\nSeeing the unadorned,\nTrusting in authenticity.\n\nEmbrace simplicity, preserve the root.\nFewer private desires, no self.\nFew desires, no demands.\n\nIn twenty chapters, abandon learning to be free from care.\nThe reason learning cannot be abandoned is to seek the Dao.\nIf one abandons the root and pursues the superficial, laboring without fruit,\nIt is better not to learn at all than to labor without gain.\n\nThe difference between \"yes\" and \"ah\" is slight—\nThe difference between good and evil, how great?\nWhat people fear, one must not fail to fear.\nTo assent is to be respectful; to agree passively is to be arrogant.\nTo those who follow the Way, assent and passive agreement, good and evil,\nAll converge in nothingness, their differences negligible.\n\nYet respect brings joy, arrogance invites anger,\nGood invites blessing, evil invites calamity—\nAnger summons disaster, threatening one’s very life—\nThus one must fear it.\n\nAll do it, how dare I not?\nVast and boundless, this Way!\n\nRespect and goodness are mere trifling deeds,\nSufficient only to avoid harm,\nYet insufficient as the Great Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and boundless, immeasurable.\nThe masses rejoice as if feasting on grand sacrifices,\nAs if ascending Spring Terrace—\nTaking delight in external things.\n\nI alone am fearful, as yet unmanifest,\nLike an infant before laughter.\n*Kids*—the sound of a child’s laughter—\nWandering, as if without destination.\n\nThe masses all have excess, striving for more,\nWhile I alone seem abandoned, possessing nothing.\nAh, the heart of the foolish one!\nPure and unadulterated.\n\nThe vulgar are bright and sharp,\nWhile I alone seem dim.\nThe vulgar are keen and discerning,\nWhile I alone am muddled.\nFaint and obscure, drifting without end,\nThe masses all conform,\nWhile I alone seem stubborn and coarse.\n\nI alone differ from others,\nValuing the nourishing Mother.\nNursed by the Original Unity,\nThe *Moral and Daoist Classic* concludes here.\n—Commentary by the Sima family.\n\n**Chapter 21**\nThe bearing of supreme virtue follows only the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing—\nVague and indistinct.\nIndistinct and vague,\nYet within it are forms.\nVague and indistinct,\nYet within it are things.\nProfound and dark,\nYet within it is essence—\nIts essence most true,\nYet within it is veracity.\nVeracity is confirmation—\nAll called the \"formless form.\"\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name has never faded,\nTo observe the myriad things.\n\nHow do I know the myriad things are thus?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter 22**\nBent, yet whole.\nRigid and straight, it breaks itself.\nCrooked, yet straight—\nThough paths are winding,\nThey lead to the Central States.\nThough rivers curve,\nThey flow to the sea.\nHollow, yet full—\nWater fills the depths,\nTrees shed their branches,\nMountains lose their bulk,\nMarshes grow fat.\nWorn, yet renewed—\nSilk brocade still bears its weight.\nFew, yet gain;\nMany, yet confused.\nThus, the Sage embraces Unity as the model for all under Heaven.\nUnity—\nThe extreme of fewness.\nNot self-illuminating, yet clear;\nTimely, yet ever manifest.\nNot self-righteous, yet renowned;\nConsulting the masses, abandoning self to follow others.\nNot self-praising, yet achieving;\nNot self-exalting, yet enduring.\nFunction and fame last eternally.\nOnly by not contending\nDoes one under Heaven find none to contend with.\nWas it not said of old:\n*\"Bent, yet whole\"*—\nWas this mere empty speech?\nTruly whole, returning to it,\nOne’s life remains unharmed.\n\n**Chapter 23**\nFew words, natural.\nThose who know the Dao speak not yet make clear—\nThus, it is called *natural*.\nA gusting wind does not last the morning,\nA sudden rain does not last the day.\nWho does this?\nHeaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth cannot endure long—\nHow much less so a man?\nThe restless multiply words,\nYet cannot abide firmly in the Dao.\nThus, those who practice the Dao\nAlign with the Dao, virtue aligns with virtue,\nLoss aligns with loss—\nAll self-attained.\nAlign with the Dao, the Dao attains it;\nAlign with virtue, virtue attains it;\nAlign with loss, loss attains it.\nNatural correspondence.\nUntrustworthy words breed distrust—\nFrom their valuing speech.\n\n**Chapter 24**\nThe limping cannot stand,\nThe striding cannot walk.\nThe heart has its attachment,\nThus cannot hold two things.\nSelf-illuminating, yet unclear;\nSelf-righteous, yet not renowned;\nSelf-praising, yet no achievement;\nSelf-exalting, yet no endurance.\nAll vie externally while perishing within.\nAs for the Dao,\nIt is \"excess food, superfluous limbs.\"\nSome may hate it,\nThus those who possess the Dao do not dwell in it.\nThough the foundation is beautiful,\nExcess may yet defile it.\nThough the foundation has merit,\nSelf-praise becomes a blemish.\nSome may hate it—\nAs if struck by it.\n\n**Chapter 25**\nThere is a thing, mixed and complete,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\nMixed and self-formed.\nSilent and vast,\nStanding alone yet unchanging—\nNo match, thus called *independent*.\nIts transformations never lose their constancy—\nThus called *unchanging*.\nCirculating endlessly without peril—\nCirculating, reaching everywhere without danger.\nIt can be the Mother of Heaven and Earth,\nGiving birth to great form.\nI do not know its name—\nNames fix forms,\nYet it is formless, beyond fixing.\nCall it the Dao—\nTaking from \"nothing that does not pass through it.\"\nForcefully name it *Great*.\nGreat is *passing*,\nPassing is *distant*,\nDistant is *returning*.\nThus, the Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nThe King is Great.\nWithin the realm are four Greats,\nAnd the King occupies one of them.\nA wise ruler does not use his position to boast.\nMan follows Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows *naturalness*.\n\n**Chapter 26**\nWeight is the root of light,\nStillness is the master of restlessness.\nThus, the virtuous man, though traveling all day,\nNever strays from his baggage.\nHe guards weight and stillness as his foundation.\nThough adorned with splendor,\nHe dwells serenely above it,\nUnmoved by it.\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nLightly bear the world?\nLightness loses ministers,\nRestlessness loses subjects.\nThe ruler light and restless—\nHis ministers do not fear him.\nThe ministers light and restless—\nThe ruler despises them.\n\n**Chapter 27**\nThe skilled traveler leaves no tracks,\nThe skilled speaker leaves no flaws,\nThe skilled planner needs no calculations—\nKnowing it must be so.\nThe skilled closer needs no bolts yet cannot be opened,\nThe fortified state does not rely on mountain passes.\nThe skilled binder needs no cords yet cannot be untied,\nThe governed people do not rely on borders.\nThus, the Sage always rescues people,\nSo none are abandoned;\nAlways rescues things,\nSo none are discarded.\nThis is called *borrowing clarity*.\nThus, the good man is the teacher of the ungood,\nThe ungood man is the resource of the good.\nNot honoring one’s teacher,\nNot cherishing one’s resource—\nThough wise, one is greatly confused.\nThis is called *the subtle mystery*.\n\n**Chapter 28**\nKnow the male,\nHold to the female,\nPossess martial strength yet do not use it.\n\nFor the sake of the world, be a valley.\nDwell in lowliness, yet be the refuge of all.\nFor the sake of the world, preserve virtue without separation,\nReturning to the state of the infant.\nThrough virtue, return to the Way.\n\nKnow the bright, hold to the dark,\nThe bright is pure and clear, the dark is turbid and foul.\nFor the sake of the world, set the standard.\n\nFor the sake of the world, set the standard,\nPreserve virtue without force,\nReturning to the state of the Uncarved.\nKnow honor, hold to disgrace—\nFor the sake of the world, be a valley.\nFor the sake of the world, be a valley,\nPreserve virtue and it shall be sufficient,\nReturning to the Uncarved.\nThe Uncarved scatters to become vessels;\nThe Sage uses it to become officials and leaders.\nWhen talents are displayed outwardly, they are like vessels,\nEach with its own function.\nThe Sage employs them according to their abilities,\nMaking them leaders of the multitude.\nThus, great governance does not cut—\nIt follows their natural course.\n\n**Chapter 29**\nThose who would take the world by force,\nI see they will not succeed.\nThe world is a sacred vessel—\nIt cannot be forced.\nForcing it brings ruin,\nSeizing it brings loss.\nForcing it harms nature,\nSeizing it disrupts adaptability.\nThus, things sometimes move, sometimes follow,\nSometimes are molded, sometimes blown,\nSometimes grow strong, sometimes weak,\nSometimes rise, sometimes fall.\nRise is completion—\nThese are all the natural tendencies of things.\nTherefore, the Sage avoids extremes,\nAvoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance.\nHe lets things follow their nature,\nRemoving only these three things.\n\n**Chapter 30**\nThose who assist the ruler with the Dao\nDo not use force to dominate the world—\nTheir work is easily undone.\nThings pushed to extremes reverse—\nHence, it is said: \"Good returns.\"\nWhere the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great armies, there are years of famine.\nWar is a cruel instrument.\nThus, the skilled warrior achieves his end\nAnd does not dare to take pride in it.\nAchievement is completion—\nWhen the task is done, cease.\nAchieve without boasting,\nAchieve without arrogance,\nAchieve without self-praise,\nAchieve without compulsion—\nThis is to achieve without force.\nWhen things are at their peak, they grow old—\nThis is called un-Dao,\nAnd un-Dao ends early.\nThe proud and forceful do not endure long.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 31**\nA fine army is an ominous instrument—\nThe better the army, the more harm it brings.\nThings may be hated for this reason,\nThus those who follow the Dao do not employ it.\nThe noble one at home values the left,\nIn war, values the right.\nArmy, an ominous instrument,\nNot the noble one’s tool—\nWhen forced to use it, let tranquility be supreme.\nTo win yet not rejoice,\nIf one rejoices in victory, it is because they delight in killing.\nThose who delight in killing\nCannot fulfill their ambitions in the world.\nHence, auspicious matters favor the left,\nOminous matters favor the right.\nThe left commander, the right commander—\nThis is spoken of in terms of funeral rites.\nWhen many are slain, let tears of sorrow flow,\nWhen victory is won, let it be treated with funeral rites.\nThis is the saying of war’s ominous nature.\n\n**Chapter 32**\nThe Dao is ever nameless,\nUnfathomable and unpointed.\nThough crude, it is small,\nYet the crude is the Dao’s essence.\nThe world dares not serve it—\nThis speaks of its reverence.\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nAll things would come of their own accord.\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nAnd sweet dew descends—\nThe people do not command it, yet it is evenly distributed.\nIf lords and kings guard the Dao,\nThen things submit, the *qi* harmonizes, and the people transform.\nAt first, it had no name,\nYet the Sage who attained the Dao\nMust establish and apply it—\nThey cannot remain without speech.\nNames are thus given.\nThough they use named measures to teach the people,\nThey still strive for simplicity and moderation,\nLest they let excess flourish.\nThe Dao’s presence in the world\nIs like rivers and valleys to the sea.\nThe teachings of deliberate action,\nCompared to the Dao, differ greatly in scale,\nYet they all ultimately return to the Dao.\n\n**Chapter 33**\nTo know others is wisdom,\nTo know oneself is enlightenment.\nTo overcome others is strength,\nTo overcome oneself is power.\nTo overcome oneself is most difficult.\nTo know contentment is wealth—\nEver content.\nTo act with resolve is to have ambition.\nTo never lose one’s place is longevity—\nTo find one’s place is security.\nTo die yet not perish is true longevity—\nThe body may be gone, but the Dao remains.\n\n**Chapter 34**\nThe Great Dao flows broadly,\nLeft and right it cannot be confined—\nThis is to say, no fixation.\nAll things rely on it to live,\nYet it does not refuse them,\nIt gives to all.\nAchievement is complete yet unclaimed,\nClothing all things yet not lording over them.\nThus, it ever lacks desire—\nThis can be called *small* indeed;\nEasily content.\nAll things return to it,\nYet it knows no master—\nThis can be called *great* indeed.\nTherefore, the Sage never claims to be great,\nAnd thus can achieve true greatness.\n\n**Chapter 35**\nGrasp the great image,\nAnd the world will turn toward you.\nThe Dao’s manifestation is called the *image*—\nThe Sage holds it,\nAnd rules the world.\nThey turn toward you yet suffer no harm,\nAnd find peace, security, and tranquility.\nDo not use deliberate action to harm them.\n\n**Chapter 36**\nDelight and bait—travelers pause.\nThe multitude is fixated on things.\nWhen the Dao issues forth in speech,\nIts flavor is faint, insipid.\nTo gaze upon it, insufficient to see;\nTo listen, insufficient to hear—\nUnlike delight and bait.\nTo use it cannot be like baiting.\nEmpty yet unyielding.\n\n**Chapter 37**\nWhen you would contract it, first expand it;\nWhen you would weaken it, first strengthen it;\nWhen you would abandon it, first exalt it;\nWhen you would take it, first give it.\nThis is called *subtle luminosity*.\nTo know the luminosity of subtlety—\nSoftness and weakness overcome hardness and strength.\nFish cannot escape the depths;\nThe state’s sharpest tools\nShould not be displayed to the people.\n\n**Chapter 38**\nThe Dao acts without doing, yet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nAll things would transform of their own accord.\nWhen transformation is about to arise,\nIt is called *action*.\nI shall govern it with the uncarved simplicity of the Nameless.\nThe uncarved simplicity of the Nameless\nWill also desire nothing—\n*Comprehensive forgetting*.\nWithout desire, in stillness,\nThe world will self-correct.\n\n*The Classic of Virtue and the Dao, Volume II concludes.\nThe Classic of Virtue and the Dao, Volume III begins.*\n\n---\n\n**Commentary by Sima [Shi] on Chapter 38**\nThe highest virtue does not claim virtue,\nAnd so it has virtue.\nIt pursues sincerity and acts accordingly,\nYet does not consider itself virtuous.\nThe lowest virtue does not lose virtue,\nAnd so it has no virtue.\nIt covets the name of virtue,\nAnd follows its outward display to seek it.\nThe highest virtue acts without doing,\nYet nothing remains undone.\nI act without doing for the people,\nAnd they transform of their own accord.\n“Without doing” means not to rely on contrived action.\nThe lowest virtue acts with contrived doing,\nAnd so it relies on contrived action.\nVirtue that relies on contrived action\nWill decay if not constantly maintained.\nThe highest benevolence acts without contriving,\nYet benefits the people according to their needs.\nThe highest righteousness acts with contriving,\nAnd so it enforces rules upon them.\nThe highest propriety acts with contriving,\nYet the people do not respond,\nSo it forces them with arms and threats.\nIt establishes institutions to compel the people,\nBut when the people refuse to comply,\nIt uses punishment to intimidate them.\n*仍* means to draw or pull; it may also be written as *扔*.\nThus, when virtue is lost, benevolence follows;\nWhen the Way is lost, virtue follows.\nThe Way is formless; virtue leaves no trace.\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;\nFish bask in the warmth, yet they cannot be held.\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety follows;\nFavor cannot be retained, so rules must be imposed.\nWhen propriety is lost, the people are confused.\nIt only governs their outward appearance.\nIndeed, propriety is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of disorder.\nLoyalty and trust are the foundation of propriety.\nIf one guards its form while forgetting its foundation,\nCunning and deceit will flourish.\nPreconceived knowledge is the ornament of the Way,\nAnd the origin of folly.\nIn the world, there are those who measure a billion degrees yet always miss the mark;\nPeople may call them wise,\nBut they are often spoken of as exhausted by calculation,\nAnd still they cannot escape folly.\nTherefore, the true man dwells in its substance, not in its ornament,\nAnd takes what is genuine, not what is superficial.\nSo he discards that and embraces this.\n\n**Chapter 39**\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nThe heavens attained the One and became clear,\nThe earth attained the One and became tranquil,\nThe spirit attained the One and became agile,\nThe grain attained the One and became abundant,\nAll things attained the One and came to life,\nAnd lords and kings attained the One to govern the world.\nTheir attainment was all the same.\nThe One is the offspring of the Dao,\nAnd the progenitor of all things,\nSo all things rely on it to succeed.\nSpeaking in terms of affairs,\nThe One is the enduring and unceasing.\nThe heavens, without the One to make them clear, would fear collapse,\nThe earth, without the One to make it tranquil, would fear upheaval,\nThe spirit, without the One to make it agile, would fear exhaustion,\nThe grain, without the One to make it abundant, would fear depletion,\nAll things, without the One to make them live, would fear annihilation,\nAnd lords and kings, without the One to make them noble and exalted, would fear decline.\nTo depart from the foundation is to lose the Dao,\nAnd so it is not constant.\nThus, nobility must be rooted in humility,\nAnd exaltation must be founded on lowliness.\nTherefore, lords and kings call themselves lonely and impoverished,\nThis is their use of humility as foundation—\nIs it not? They dare not forget their root.\nHence, they attain the myriad chariots yet have no chariots,\n\nThe measure of softness surpasses that of trees—\nEach points to its own name, yet there are no more chariots.\n\nDo not desire brilliance like jade,\nNor coldness like stone.\n\n**Chapter Forty**\nThe Dao moves through reversal;\nThe interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao.\nThe yielding is the Dao’s function.\n\nAll things under heaven arise from being,\nBeing arises from non-being.\n\n**Chapter Forty—**\nThe superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it;\nThe middle person hears the Dao and holds it as if it were fading;\nThe inferior person hears the Dao and laughs at it—\nIf they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.\n\nThe Dao that is not ordinary\nIs not known by ordinary people.\n\nThus, the ancient teachings say:\nTo clarify the Dao is to seem obscure,\nTo advance the Dao is to seem to retreat,\nTo smooth the Dao is to seem uneven—\n*Uneven* refers to the unevenness of silk threads.\n\nVirtue supreme is like a valley,\nGreat brightness is like a stain,\nAmple virtue seems insufficient,\nEstablished virtue seems stolen,\nSincerity seems perverse,\nThe greatest square has no corners,\nThe greatest vessel takes longest to form,\nThe greatest sound is faintest in tone,\nThe greatest image has no form—\nThe Dao is hidden, nameless.\n\nOnly the Dao\nLends itself generously yet completes its work.\nThings rely on it to be completed yet cannot possess it—\nThus, it is called *lending*.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two**\nThe Dao gives birth to the One,\n\n「From the Non-Being to the Being.\nThe One gives birth to the Two,\nDividing Yin and Yang.\nThe Two gives birth to the Three,\nNourished by the harmonizing *zhōnghé* (中和).\nThe Three gives birth to the myriad things.\nAll things bear Yin on their backs and embrace Yang,\nBear being akin to *bèi* (背, \"to turn away\"),\nEmbrace akin to *xiàng* (向, \"to face\").\nThe clash of opposing *qi* (氣) achieves harmony.\nAll things lack not the substance of Yin and Yang,\nNor the function of clashing *qi*.\n\nWhat people detest,\nAre the solitary, the widowed, and the childless,\nYet kings and nobles prize them as *chēng* (称, \"auspicious\").\nThus, some things may be diminished yet gain,\nOr augmented yet lose.\nFullness invites harm,\nHumility invites benefit—\nBoth are ways to avoid excess,\nAnd approach the harmonizing *zhōnghé*.\n\nWhat people teach,\nI also teach.\n*I also teach* (亦我教之) means *I too teach* (亦我教之).\nThe overbearing perish without their due end,\nI shall take them as my *jiào fù* (教父, \"teachers of the multitude\").\nAs the teacher of all.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three**\nThe supreme softness in the world,\nRides roughshod over the supreme hardness in the world—\nThe watercourse of Tai Mountain (泰山之溜) pierces stone.\nNothing enters where there is no gap,\nThus I know the benefit of *wuwei* (無為, non-action).\nThe finest of forms,\nCannot be as subtle as dust,\nYet cannot enter where there are no crevices.\nOnly the Non-Being\nCan enter where there is no gap.\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid,\nThe benefit of non-action,\nFew in the world can attain.\nKnowers are rare.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**」\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five**\nWhat is more intimate—name or body?\nWhat is more abundant—body or wealth?\nWhat brings greater suffering—gain or loss?\nTo gain name and wealth while losing one’s body,\nOr to lose name and wealth while preserving one’s body—\nWhich brings greater suffering?\n\nThus, the more one clings to, the more one consumes;\nThe more one hoards, the more one loses.\nHe who knows sufficiency is not humiliated;\nHe who knows when to stop is not in peril.\nThus may one endure long.\n\nThe greatest fullness seems a void—\nIts use is inexhaustible.\nThe greatest abundance seems empty—\nIts use is boundless.\nThings complete must decay;\nFullness must overflow—\nThis is the constant way of things.\n\nThe man of the Dao, though complete, seems deficient;\nThough abundant, seems empty—\nThus his use is neither exhausted nor boundless.\n\nThe most straight seems bent,\nThe most skillful seems clumsy,\nThe most eloquent seems tongue-tied.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold—\nAction ensues.\nStillness overcomes heat—\nNon-action prevails.\nClarity and tranquility are the rectification of the world.\nIn emptiness and stillness, observe all things.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six**\nWhen the Dao prevails in the world,\nWarhorses are turned to plow.\nNo striving, no contention—\nContain the external, cultivate the internal.\n\nWhen the Dao does not prevail in the world,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\nGreed is insatiable—\nInternal strife, external contention.\nNo greater crime than coveting what is desired—\nThe common man, though blameless, bears guilt for his treasure.\nNo greater calamity than insatiability,\nNo greater fault than desiring what one cannot have.\nThus, he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven**\nWithout stepping beyond the door,\nKnow the world.\nWithout peering through the window,\nSee the Dao of Heaven.\nObtain its root and source.\nThe farther one strays from the root,\nThe less one knows.\nChasing ends while abandoning origins—\nThus the sage acts without knowing,\nNames without seeing,\nHolds fast to the unchanging,\nAccomplishes without doing.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight**\nTo study learning is daily increase;\nTo study the Dao is daily decrease.\nStrip away the superficial and redundant.\nReduce, and reduce again—\nUntil one reaches *wuwei* (non-action).\nIn *wuwei*, there is nothing that cannot be done.\n\nThe limping cannot stand;\nThe striding cannot walk.\nTo act is to be obstructed in a corner—\nThus, in *wuwei*, there is nothing that cannot be done.\n\nTherefore, he who would take the world\nMust act with *wuwei*—\nLet the world return to it of its own accord.\nWhen action arises,\nIt is insufficient to take the world.\nForce it, and things will not comply.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine**\nThe sage has no fixed heart,\nBut takes the hearts of the people as his own.\nFollowing the times, adapting to things,\nResponding to change in accordance with the Dao.\nThe good, I treat as good;\nThe ungood, I also treat as good—\nThus goodness is attained.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nThus trust is attained.\nThough they are ungood, I myself act with goodness toward them—\nTheir goodness is not lost.\nThough they are untrustworthy, I myself uphold trust toward them—\nTheir trust is not lost.\n\nThe sage in the world,\nChattering ceaselessly to harmonize the hearts of the people.\nHarmonizing their hearts,\nHe makes no distinctions.\nAll the people turn their ears and eyes toward him,\nTaking him as model and mirror.\nThe sage treats them all as infants,\nLoving them as his own children.\n\n**Chapter Fifty**\nTo enter and exit life and death,\nTo emerge from the birthplace and enter the deathplace.\nThirteen are born in life,\nThirteen are born in death,\nThirteen are born into the realm of death by their own motion.\nWhy is this?\nBecause their vitality is excessive.\n\nOf ten people, roughly three preserve their lives through gentleness and weakness,\nThree hasten their deaths through rigidity and strength,\nAnd even those who seek to cherish life cannot avoid rushing toward death—\nAlso three.\n\nThose who cherish life yet rush toward death\nDo so because their self-nurturing is too excessive.\n\nIt is said that the adept at preserving life\nWalks on land without encountering rhinoceros or tiger,\nEnters battle without being struck by weapons—\nThe rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,\nThe tiger no place to wield its claws,\nWeapons no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this?\nBecause there is no deathplace for him.\n\nThe rhinoceros and tiger are metaphors for brute force and violence.\nTo dwell among the strong and violent yet suffer no harm is because of one’s gentleness and non-contentiousness.\n\n**Chapter 51**\nThe Dao gives birth to it.\nThe root origin, formless, is called the Dao.\nVirtue nurtures it.\nQi and transformations manifest as virtue.\nThings take form,\nGathering to become material, their essences diverse yet scattered.\nMomentum completes it—\nLife must grow, growth must mature, by the natural order.\nThus, all things reverence the Dao and hold virtue dear,\nHonoring it as parent and child.\nThe Dao’s exalted nature, virtue’s noble worth—\nNone bestow these titles, yet they abide eternally natural.\nThe sage harmonizes virtue and the Dao across the world,\nAnd thus is revered by all.\nTherefore, the Dao gives birth and nurtures,\nGrows and fosters, completes and matures,\nNourishes and shelters.\nWhen its work is done, all returns to the Dao.\nTo give birth yet not possess,\nTo act yet not rely,\nTo grow yet not dominate—\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\n**Chapter 52**\nThe world has a beginning,\nWhich becomes the mother of the world.\nThis beginning is the Dao,\nThe Dao being the source from which all things arise.\nHaving found its mother,\nOne knows its children.\nEstablishing rites, music, punishments, and governance from the Dao,\nHaving known its children,\nOne must return to guard its mother—\nThus, one’s life remains unharmed.\nDo not forget the root, abandon the Dao.\nSeal its openings,\nClose its gates,\nAnd one’s life will never labor.\nOpen its openings,\nAdvance its affairs,\nAnd one’s life will never be saved.\nSeeing the small as clarity,\nHolding to gentleness as strength.\nUsing its radiance,\nReturning to its clarity—\nNo calamity befalls the body—\nThis is called following the constant.\nRadiance shines outward,\nClarity illuminates within.\n\n**Chapter 53**\nIf I were to have clear awareness,\nWalking the Great Dao,\nOnly reverence would guide me.\nThe Great Dao is most smooth,\nYet people love shortcuts.\nThe Dao is inherently simple and easy,\nBut because people prefer to carve their own paths,\nThey lose the Dao.\nMorning halls are swept clean,\nFields lie fallow,\nGranaries stand empty.\nIn a land that has lost the Dao,\nThey scrutinize what is near while neglecting what is far,\nChase trivialities while forgetting the root—\nThus, though their halls appear orderly,\nTheir people are truly impoverished.\nWearing ornate robes,\nBearing sharp swords,\nGluttonous in food and drink,\nHoarding wealth—\nThis is called thievish vanity.\nTaking what is not one’s own is called theft.\nWhen virtue is shallow yet rank is high,\nWhen wisdom is small yet schemes are grand,\nDanger and ruin are imminent.\nYet they do not realize it,\nAnd instead grow arrogant,\nBelieving themselves to be—\nWhen they are pleased with their gains,\nTheir fine attire is unsuited,\nTheir stored wealth is insatiable—\nThus, it is called thievish vanity.\nThievish vanity—\nHow can this be the Dao?\nWhy do such vanities arise?\nIs it not because they originally sought the Dao,\nYet carved their own paths and thus lost it?\n\n**Chapter 54**\nThe adept at establishing—\nCannot be uprooted.\n\nDeep-rooted and firmly anchored,\nIt cannot be moved or shaken.\nThe adept at embracing—\nDoes not grow weary,\nFor the people’s hearts are in harmony,\nUnshakable, untaken.\nTheir descendants’ sacrifices\nDo not falter at the door,\nTheir blessings endure long.\n\nCultivate it in the self—\nIts virtue becomes true.\nCultivate it in the family—\nIts virtue becomes abundant.\n*Abundant* should read *lent*.\nCultivate it in the village—\nIts virtue becomes enduring.\nCultivate it in the state—\nIts virtue becomes plentiful.\nCultivate it in the world—\nIts virtue becomes universal.\n\nAll follow the root to govern the branches,\nFrom near to far.\nThus, observe the self to know the self,\nObserve the family to know the family,\nObserve the village to know the village,\nObserve the state to know the state—\nAs one.\nObserve the world to know the world.\nCompare the past to the present.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\nFrom one, know ten thousand.\n\nThose rich in contained virtue\nAre like the infant.\nPoisonous creatures do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not seize,\nHawks do not snatch.\nWords of utmost harmony\nEven the cruel cannot bear to harm.\nBones weak, sinews soft, yet grip firm—\nUnknowing of male and female union, yet erect—\nThe essence is supreme.\nCries all day yet voice does not grow hoarse—\nHarmony is supreme.\nAll lies in its naturalness.\nKnow harmony as constant,\nKnow constancy as clarity.\nTo nurture life is auspicious—\nAuspicious is good.\nThe goodness of harmony\nCan nurture life.\nLet the heart command the *qi*—this is strength.\nThe will governs the *qi*;\nThe heart moves, the *qi* becomes disordered,\nThe *qi* disordered, the mind grows dim,\nThe heart cannot control—\nThus arise perverse and violent deeds.\nCommon folk deem those with abundant *qi* as strong,\nBut Laozi alone deems those whose heart commands the *qi* as strong.\nWhen things are at their peak, they age—\nThis is called *not-Dao*,\nAnd *not-Dao* perishes early.\nNot using one’s peak strength\nCan avert premature ruin.\n\nThe wise do not speak,\nFor they hold it within.\nThose who speak do not know—\nThey seek it without.\nSeal the senses,\nClose the gates,\nNo coming or going.\nDull the sharp,\nUntangle the tangled,\nHarmonize the brilliance,\nBlend with the dust—\nThis is called *Mysterious Unity*.\nThe Mysterious is supremely deep,\nThe firm has no outside.\nThus, it cannot be approached or distanced,\nCannot be used for gain or harm,\nCannot be honored or debased—\nGuarding the Dao, it does not move.\nThus, it is held in highest esteem by the world.\n\nGovern with rectitude—\nGovernment is rectitude.\nUse the unusual in warfare—\nThe martial arts value deceit.\nConquer the world without strife.\nHow do I know this is so?\nThe world abounds in taboos,\nYet the people grow poorer.\nThe people multiply sharp tools,\nAnd the state grows more corrupt.\nThe people rely on cleverness,\nAnd strange things proliferate.\nLaws multiply, yet thieves abound.\nLaws breed deceit.\nThus, the Sage says:\n*I act without action, yet the people transform themselves;\nI take no action, yet the people grow rich;\nI remain at ease, yet do not disturb.\nI love stillness, yet the people align themselves;\nI correct myself, and all things correct themselves.\nI desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.\nEven rewards cannot make them steal.*\n\nWhen governance is dim,\nThe people are pure.\nHold to the essentials alone.\nWhen governance is sharp,\nThe people grow weary.\nHarsh laws leave no one unblemished.\nDisaster, oh disaster—\nFortune’s shadow looms.\nFortune, oh fortune—\nDisaster’s seed lies hidden.\nWho knows their limits?\nIs there no rectitude?\nDisaster within fortune,\nFortune within disaster—\nThe world has no pure disaster, no pure fortune.\nRectitude becomes the unusual,\nGoodness becomes the bizarre.\nNot only disaster and fortune invert thus—\nEvil and rectitude, good and bad\nAlso constantly reverse,\nAll by the principle that extremes invert.\nThe people’s confusion\nHas lasted long indeed.\nNone in the world comprehend it.\nThus, the Sage is square yet does not cut,\nSharp yet not harsh,\n*Year*—to scrape.\nStraight yet not domineering,\nBrilliant yet not dazzling—\nNone desire to reach extremes.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven, Nothing Exceeds Frugality.**\n*Cultivate the spirit of frugality.*\nFor only through frugality\nDoes one return early.\nReturning early is called *accumulating virtue*—\nNot distant, yet returning,\nNot estranged from virtue,\nOne may thus refine oneself.\n*Accumulate virtue* and nothing shall you fail to overcome.\n*Diligently uphold virtue* and even the ordinary may rival the noble.\nIf nothing fails you, none shall know your limits—\n*Universal efficacy*.\nIf none know your limits, you may have a realm.\nThen you may safeguard your realm.\nThe *root* of having a realm,\nMay endure long.\n*The root* refers to *nurturing the spirit and cultivating virtue*.\nThis is called the *Dao/Way of deep-rooted stability and enduring longevity*.\n\n**Chapter 60: Governing Great Realms, Like Poaching Small Fish.**\nDisturb them and they spoil.\n*Advancing with the Dao* into the world,\nTheir *ghosts* shall not be *mysterious*.\nThings each find their place—\nNo *portents* or calamities.\nNot that their *ghosts* are not *mysterious*—\nTheir *mysteriousness* does not harm people;\nCold and heat, wind and rain—\nTransforming, giving birth.\nNot that their *mysteriousness* does not harm people—\nThe Sage also does not harm people.\nThe Sage *harmonizes* with *ghosts* and *spirits* in their auspicious and inauspicious.\nSince both do not harm each other,\nVirtue *intermingles* and returns.\nThe people are the *master* of the *spirit*—\nIf the Sage does not harm people,\nThen the *spirit* shall not harm either.\n\n**Chapter 60: Great Realms Flow Downward.**\nThey are the *confluence* of the world,\nThe *female* of the world.\n*The confluence* is like gathering—\nGreat realms thus become *king* or *conqueror*,\nFlowing downward like rivers and seas.\nThe *female* always overcomes the *male* through stillness,\nIts stillness lies in its yielding.\n*Explain* the *female* as virtue.\nThus, great realms yield to small realms,\nAnd take small realms;\nSmall realms yield to great realms,\nAnd take great realms.\nThus, sometimes yielding to take,\nSometimes yielding yet taken.\nTaking to take from others,\nYet taken by others.\nGreat realms seek only to *encompass and nourish* people,\nSmall realms seek only to *enter and serve* others.\nBoth gain what they desire,\nThus the great should properly yield.\n\nThose who *revere Heaven* safeguard their realm,\nThose who *delight in Heaven* safeguard the world.\n\n**Chapter 61: The Dao/Way, the Mystery of All Things.**\nIt *permeates* all things and speaks.\nThe virtuous treasure it,\nGuard and employ it.\nThe unvirtuous hold onto it,\nRelying on the Dao/Way to find their ease.\n*Graceful words* may be *traded*,\n*Noble actions* may be *bestowed*.\n*Graceful words* may teach people,\nAs one gains goods in trade.\n*Noble actions* may make people submit,\nYet not be beneath them.\n\nPeople’s unvirtue—\nWhy should one abandon it?\nWhat is precious in the Dao/Way\nIs its *all-encompassing tolerance* and *profound transformation*,\nLike the *central* abandoning the *non-central*,\nThe *talented* abandoning the *untalented*—\nThus they do not become *virtuous*.\nHence, establishing the *Son of Heaven*,\nSetting up the *Three Exalted Ministers*,\nEstablishing a *lord* to tend his people,\nSetting up *assistants* to guide and protect his lord.\nThough one has *jewel-arches* and *four-horse chariots* to present,\nIt is not as good as *sitting and advancing* this Dao/Way.\n*Jewel-arches*—jewels as large as an arch.\nIn ancient times, gifts were presented,\nAnd some were given precedence.\nTreasures are finite,\nThe Dao/Way is boundless.\nWhy was this Dao/Way so treasured in antiquity?\nWas it not because one *seeks* and *obtains* it,\nAnd *avoids guilt* through it?\nThus, it is precious for the world.\nThose who *seek* and follow the Dao/Way\nShall have no failure.\nThose who *transgress* yet return to the Dao/Way\nShall have no guilt.\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao/Way of Non-Action.**\nDo without doing,\nAct without acting,\nTaste without tasting.\nGreat or small, many or few—\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nView the small as great,\nView the few as many—\nOffend yet do not retaliate.\nPlan the difficult in its ease,\nAchieve the great in its smallness.\nThe world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease,\nThe world’s great tasks must begin in smallness.\nThus, the Sage never seeks to do great,\nAnd so may complete the great.\nDiligent and earnest,\nA thousand concerns arise each day—\nThus may one govern without doing.\n\nLight promises bring little trust—\nHence *Zilu* made no idle vows.\nMuch ease brings much difficulty.\nThe petty begin with ease and end in difficulty.\nThus, the Sage *approaches* difficulty,\nAnd so shall have no difficulty at all.\nThe noble begin with difficulty and end in ease.\n\n**Chapter 63: The Sage’s Mastery of the Dao/Way.**\nIts ease is hard to maintain,\nIts unseen signs are hard to plan,\nIts fragility is hard to break,\nIts subtlety is hard to disperse.\nAct before it exists,\nGovern before chaos arises.\nA tree as thick as one’s embrace,\nGrows from a tiny sprout;\nA nine-tiered tower,\nRises from piled earth;\nA journey of a thousand *li*,\nBegins beneath one’s feet.\nAll speak of *preventing the subtle* and *cautiously beginning*.\n\nThose who *act* shall ruin it,\nHarming *Nature*.\nThose who *grasp* shall lose it,\nStagnating in things.\nThus, the Sage does without doing,\nAnd so has no ruin—\nNo gain, no loss.\nNo grasping, no loss.\nNo losing, no gaining.\nThe people’s undertakings\nOften fail when nearly complete—\n*Be cautious at the end as at the beginning*,\nAnd no ruin shall come of affairs.\n\nThus, the Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures;\nWhat the Sage desires,\nIs what is not desired—\nThus, he does not prize rare and strange things.\n*Learn without learning*,\nRepairing the errors of the multitude,\nTo *assist* the *natural* unfolding of all things,\nYet daring not to *act*.\nThe multitude *overuse* their minds,\nCreating *superfluous growths*—\nThus, what people should *learn*\nIs to *not learn*,\nTo repair the multitude’s errors.\nAll things *give birth and grow*,\nNone escape *Nature*—\nThe Sage merely *assists* them,\nDaring not to *force* anything.\n\n**Chapter 64: The Sage’s Wisdom in Governance.**\nThe wise in ancient times\nDid not *enlighten* the people—\nThey sought to *bewilder* them.\nAbandon ornamentation, embrace substance,\nReturn to simplicity, revert to *primordial* purity.\nThe people’s difficulty in governance\nLies in their *excessive cleverness*—\nDeceit and trickery disrupt the polity.\nThus, governing with *cleverness*,\nThe realm’s *bane*—\nAbove and below deceive each other.\nNot governing with *cleverness*,\nThe realm’s *blessing*.\nThe *Way of Kings* is straight.\nKnowing these two,\nOne may set the *model*.\nAlways knowing the *model*,\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\nKnowing to use *cleverness* is not as good as not using it—\nWithout *profound and subtle virtue*,\nWho could *assist* in this?\n\n**Chapter 66: The Dao of the Sage’s Humility**\n*Mysterious Virtue* is profound and distant,\nOpposed to things yet in perfect accord—\nThus attaining the *Great Harmony*.\n\nAll creatures demand *cleverness*,\nYet those who possess *Mysterious Virtue* alone despise it—\nThough opposed to things, they align with the *Way*.\n\nThe rivers and seas become kings of all valleys\nBecause they excel in yielding.\nThus the sage, desiring to lead others,\nSpeaks with humility;\nDesiring to precede others,\nActs with deference.\n\nThus, though placed above, none grow weary of him,\nThough placed before, none are harmed by him—\nHence the world willingly follows without tiring.\n\nBecause he does not contend,\nNone can contend with him.\n\nFullness invites loss; humility invites gain.\n\n**Chapter 67: The Three Treasures**\nAll under heaven say my *Way* is vast,\nYet I seem unworthy.\n*Worthy* means resemblance—\nMy words differ from the masses.\n\nOnly because it is vast does it seem unworthy.\nIf it were long worthy, it would be trifling.\n\nI have three treasures; guard and hold them:\nFirst, *compassion*;\nSecond, *frugality*;\nThird, *not daring to lead the world*.\n\n*Compassion* makes one courageous—\nThe virtuous must be bold.\n*Frugality* makes one expansive—\nModeration brings abundance.\nNot daring to lead the world,\nOne may become the vessel’s master.\n\nThe vessel’s master is like establishing law—\nThe teacher of all, hence called the vessel’s master.\n\nNow abandon *compassion* and its boldness,\nAbandon *frugality* and its abundance,\nAbandon deference and take precedence—\nDeath will follow.\nYou will be harmed by things.\n\n*Compassion* in battle brings victory,\nIn defense brings security.\nThe virtuous are the people’s refuge.\nHeaven aids them with *compassion* as their shield—\nNo one dares to harm them.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Virtue of Non-Contention**\nThe skilled warrior is not fierce,\nBut subdues through *virtue*.\nThe skilled fighter does not rage,\nOnly seeks resolution.\nThe skilled victor does not contend—\nHe bends others’ arms without battle.\n\nThe skilled ruler serves below,\nWinning their affection.\n\nThis is called the *virtue of non-contention*,\nThe *power of using people*,\nThe *harmony with Heaven’s ancient extreme*.\n\n*Virtue* aligns with Heaven—\nSince the birth of the people, none surpasses it.\n\n**Chapter 69: The Art of War**\nIn wielding arms, one says:\nI dare not be the aggressor but only the defender.\n*The aggressor* means bearing strong arms as one’s duty.\n*The defender* means others press upon me, and I respond unwillingly.\n\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot—\nHumility without blame.\n\nThis is called *action without action*—\nNo action yet it arrives.\n*Seizing without arms*—\nNo arms yet can seize others.\n*No enemy*—\nThe enemy surrenders without resistance.\n*Grasping without weapons*—\nNo weapons yet complete victory.\n\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—\nUnderestimating the enemy risks losing my treasures.\n*Treasures* mean the three treasures.\n\nThus, when armies clash, the compassionate prevail.\nDirect speech without contention\nMakes one pitied by all.\n\n**Chapter 70: The Simplicity of the Dao**\nMy words are easy to know,\nEasy to practice.\nSimple and unadorned—\nYet none under heaven know or practice them.\n\n*Focused unity*—\nWords have their root;\n*Essential substance*—\nAffairs have their master.\n*Return to the origin*—\nOnly the ignorant are unknown to me.\nKnowledge reveals the *Way*.\n\nFew know me, thus I am honored.\nThe *Way* is vast, so few comprehend it.\nThus the sage wears coarse robes while cherishing jade,\nHiding brilliance to nurture integrity.\n\n**Chapter 71: The Disease of Knowing**\nKnowing yet pretending ignorance—*benefit*.\nIgnoring yet pretending knowledge—*illness*.\nKnowing as if ignorant—\nQuickly invites resentment.\nIgnoring yet forcing knowledge—\nInvites misfortune.\n\nOnly because of this illness\nDoes one avoid illness.\nThe sage’s freedom from illness\nLies in treating illness as illness—\nThus he remains unharmed.\n\nIf people know their own illness,\nThey will not suffer greatly.\n\n**Chapter 72: The Sage’s Contentment**\nThe people do not fear death—\nHow can death frighten them?\nSeeing profit, they forget life—\nThis is not fearing death.\n\nIf one makes people constantly fear death,\nAnd those who act strangely—\nI could seize and kill them—\nWho would dare?\n\n*Strange* means *perverse*.\nThere are always those charged with killing.\nHeaven, intending to remove evil,\nMust use one hand.\n\nTo substitute for those who kill is like\nA carpenter’s apprentice wielding the axe—\nFew escape uninjured.\n*Willfully causing harm*.\n\nThe sage does not dwell where he rests,\nNor chooses where to settle.\nHe is not sated by his food,\nNor dazzled by his garments.\n\nOnly because he is not sated\nDoes he not grow sated.\nNot sated by things,\nNor sated by things.\n\nThus the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nUnknown by others yet unperturbed.\nHe values himself but does not exalt himself,\nHumility to nurture himself.\n\nThus he discards that and takes this—\nDiscards external allure, takes inner joy.\n\n**Chapter 73: The Peril of Boldness**\nBoldness in daring leads to death,\nBoldness in restraint leads to life.\nKnowing these two,\nOne may gain or lose.\n\nWhat does Heaven abhor?\nWho knows its reason?\nThus the sage finds it difficult.\n\nPeople know this and avoid death to seek life—*benefit*.\nYet some, knowing this, hasten their own death—*harm*.\nIs this not how Heaven abhors people?\n\nWho can grasp its intent?\n\nThus the sage does not dare lightly speak of Heaven’s *Way*.\nHeaven’s *Way*:\nDoes not contend yet prevails,\nLets things be natural—none can defy it.\nDoes not speak yet responds—\nFollows its course, answering with fortune or calamity.\nDoes not summon yet they come,\nDoes not hasten yet it arrives,\nDoes not move yet it reaches.\nEffortless yet well-planned.\n\n*Slow and measured*—\nNo haste, yet nothing fails.\nHeaven’s net is vast—\nWide yet nothing slips.\n\n*Vast*—a great appearance.\n\nThe people’s hunger comes from their rulers taking too much in taxes—thus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed comes from their rulers’ excessive interference—thus they are difficult to govern.\nDisturbance is why they are difficult to govern.\n\nThe people’s indifference to death comes from their excessive pursuit of life—thus they lightly regard death.\nTo seek profit is how one sustains life, yet the people often lose their lives through profit.\nThus, only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who value it.\nThey forsake their own bodies, yet their bodies remain.\n\n**Chapter 76**\n\nThe people’s birth is soft and weak,\nTheir death is firm and strong.\nAll things, grasses and trees, are soft and pliable when they live,\nYet when they die, they wither and decay.\nThus, the firm and strong are the companions of death,\nWhile the soft and weak are the companions of life.\nTherefore, armies that are strong yet overconfident do not conquer,\nAnd those that are arrogant are destroyed.\nTrees that are strong are split.\nThe strong are placed beneath, the weak above.\n\n**Chapter 77**\nHeaven’s *Way*—is it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high are pressed down, the low are raised up,\nThe overabundant are diminished, the insufficient are supplied.\nDeficit and excess are balanced.\nHeaven’s *Way*: diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.\nBut humanity’s *Way* is not so—\nThey diminish the deficient to honor the excessive.\nThey oppress the lowly to exalt the noble,\nThey plunder the poor to enrich the rich,\nThey burden the foolish with the wise,\nThey overwhelm the unworthy with the virtuous.\nWho can use their excess to nourish the world?\nOnly those who follow the *Way*.\nThus, the sage acts yet does not claim credit,\nAccomplishes yet does not dwell on it—\nIs this not because they do not wish to see virtue perverted?\nThe sage’s virtue and power are in excess,\nThus they push it forward to give to others.\n\n**Chapter 78**\nNowhere in the world is there anything softer and weaker than water,\nYet in overcoming the hard and strong, nothing can surpass it—\nBecause water has no equal.\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nThe world knows this, yet few can practice it.\nTherefore the sage’s words say:\n*\"To bear the filth of the state is to be its lord and guardian;\nTo bear the ill omens of the state is to be the king of the world.\"*\nThus, upright words seem contrary.\nTo endure filth and accept impurity,\nOne may thereby achieve greatness.\n\n**Chapter 79**\nTo reconcile great grudges,\nThere must always be some lingering resentment—\nHow can this be considered good?\nThus, the sage holds the left half of the contract,\nYet does not blame the other.\nTherefore, those with *virtue/power* hold the contract,\nWhile those without hold the full agreement.\nHeaven’s *Way* favors none—\nIt always aligns with the good.\n\n**Chapter 80**\nIn small states with few people,\nLet there be the implements of ten families and a hundred households,\nYet do not use them.\nLet the people value death yet not value moving.\nLove life and cherish the land.\nThough they have carriages and boats,\nThey have no place to ride upon them—\nThey do not travel.\nThough they have weapons and armor,\nThey have no place to display them—\nThey do not fight.\nLet the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\nLet them not deceive one another.\nLet their food be simple yet satisfying,\nTheir clothing fine yet practical,\nTheir dwellings secure yet comfortable,\nTheir customs joyful yet unpretentious.\nThough their ways seem coarse, repulsive, narrow, and crude,\nThey consider them satisfying, beautiful, secure, and joyful.\nNeighboring states are visible to one another,\nThe sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—\nHow close they are!\nThe people live out their days and die\nWithout ever visiting one another.\nThey have no desires.\n\n**Chapter 80**\nTrustworthy words are not ornate—\nThey are plain and true.\nOrnate words are not trustworthy—\nThey are superficial and clever.\nThe good do not argue—\nThe fortunate few speak.\nThose who argue are not good—\nFalsehoods are sweetly spoken.\nThe wise are not all-knowing—\nThey hold one thread through all.\nThe all-knowing are not wise—\nMany paths lead to lost sheep.\nThe sage does not hoard—\nThey do not take what is not theirs.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven,\nWhen given to others, the more they have, the more I possess—\nVirtue and wisdom are boundless.\nWhen taken from others, the more they have, the more I lose—\nYet the more I take, the more I gain.\nThe Dao of Heaven,\nBenefits without harming;\nSpring brings forth growth, autumn yields harvest—\nThus, it adorns and nourishes all beneath the sky.\n\nThe Dao of the sage,\nActs without contention.\nUnable to act without purpose,\nYet aids without coercion.\nVirtue and the *Way* of the *Zhenjing* conclude here, Volume Four.",

      "translated_text": "**The Treatise on the *Dao De* Classic**\n\n**Title:** *Treatise on the Dao De Classic*. Annotated by Sima Guang (宋司马光注). Four volumes. Source text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), under the category of *Divine Essence and Supreme Purity* (洞神都) *Jewel Precepts* (玉诀类). The original text lacks chapter titles; these are added according to Wang Bi’s (王弼) version.\n\n---\n\n**Volume One of the *Treatise on the Dao De Classic* – Sima Guang’s Annotations**\n\nThe Grand Historian (太史公) said: The *Laozi* composed a book in two parts, upper and lower, expounding the meaning of *Dao* and *De*. Later generations, taking the opening phrases of each section, named the upper part *Dao* and the lower part *De*. But *Dao* and *De* are inseparable, and so I retain the original title.\n\n**Chapter One**\n*Dao* that can be spoken of is not the Eternal *Dao*;\nA name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.\nThe vulgar speak of *Dao* as a subtle essence,\nIndescribable, beyond all naming.\nBut the *Laozi* holds this otherwise:\n*Dao* can indeed be spoken of—\nYet it is not the *Dao* that common folk speak of.\nA name can indeed be given—\nYet it is not the Name that common folk give.\nWhat common folk call *Dao* is but a fixation on things;\nWhat they call a Name is but a rigid, entangling distinction.\nThe Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of all forms,\nYet their origin must lie in the Formless—\nHence the Nameless is called their beginning.\nAll things arise through form,\nYet their creation must depend on the Formed—\nHence the Named is called their mother.\n\nThe Formless is ever-present,\nTo behold its wonders.\nThe Formed is ever-present,\nTo grasp its limits.\n*Limits* (徼) refers to boundaries.\nOnce things are Formed, the Formless seems to have no use.\nYet the Sage retains the Formless without abandoning it,\nTo exhaust the subtleties of divine transformation.\nIf the Formless is so precious,\nThen the Formed seems to have no use.\nYet the Sage retains the Formed without abandoning it,\nTo establish the boundaries of all affairs.\nIf one were to discard the Formed and cling only to the Formless,\nIt would drift and scatter, lacking all boundaries—\nThus the Formed is advantageous, the Formless is instrumental.\nThese two are of the same origin but different names,\nBoth called *Xuan* (玄).\n*Xuan* again, *Xuan*—\nThe gateway to all wonders.\n*Xuan* is neither Formed nor Formless,\nThe ultimate subtlety.\n\n**Chapter Two**\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—\nThen it is no longer beauty;\nAll know goodness as goodness—\nThen it is no longer goodness.\nBeauty and goodness have paths,\nKnown by all—\nYet they are not the utmost of beauty and goodness.\nThus the Formless and the Formed give rise to each other,\nThe difficult and the easy complete one another,\nThe long and the short define each other,\nThe high and the low complement each other,\nThe sounds and the voices harmonize,\nThe before and the after follow in sequence.\nAll things that have traces and forms\nMust necessarily be unequal.\nUnequal, they contend;\nContend, they fall into disorder;\nDisorder, they reach exhaustion—\nHence the Sage does not value them.\n\nTherefore the Sage acts in non-doing,\nAnd employs wisdom as Yu (禹) directed the waters—\nMoving where there is no obstruction.\nHe teaches without speaking;\nHis person is upright—\nAnd without commands, things are done.\nAll things arise, yet he does not claim them;\nHis mind issues forth—\nYet things may not yet respond.\nWhen things arrive, he responds—\nWithout refusal or rejection.\nHe gives birth yet does not possess,\nNurturing all things without appropriating them for himself.\nHe acts yet does not rely upon it,\nFor the Sage cannot fully refrain from action under Heaven—\nYet he does not depend on it as his own strength.\nWhen his work is done, he does not dwell upon it.\nHe does not boast—\nThus none contend with him for ability;\nHe does not claim credit—\nThus none contend with him for achievement.\n\n**Chapter Three**\nDo not exalt the virtuous—\nSo the people will not contend.\nYet the virtuous cannot be ignored—\nAll know this.\nBut when its excesses are considered,\nContention for reputation brings only disorder—\nThus the *Laozi* corrects this, urging people to value substance over name.\n\nDo not prize difficult-to-obtain wealth—\nSo the people will not become thieves.\nDo not display what is desirable—\nSo the heart will not be disturbed.\nTherefore the Sage’s governance:\nEmpties their desires—\nSo the people have no cravings for gain.\nFills their bellies—\nSo they have enough to eat.\nWeakens their ambitions—\nSo they dare not contend or seize.\nStrengthens their bones—\nSo they labor with vigor.\nEver keeps the people in ignorance and free from desire,\nContent with their food, pleased with their garments—\nUnaware of anything beyond their needs.\nThus even the wise dare not act.\nNone respond to him.\nIf he acts in non-doing,\nNothing remains ungoverned.\nIf he governs them to reach non-doing—\nThis is his way.\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe *Dao* is vast yet used, yet never full;\nDeep as the ancestral source of all things.\nFathomless, it is ever the master of things.\nIt blunts their sharpness—\nFor the *Dao* abhors exposed ferocity.\nIt unravels their entanglements—\nFor the *Dao* despises chaotic affairs.\nIt subdues their brilliance—\nFor the *Dao* deems resplendent display contemptible.\nIt aligns with their dust—\nFor the *Dao* values the humble and defiled.\nSerene, it seems as if it exists—\nYet serene and unmoving, it appears both present and absent.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nYet it precedes the Emperor.\nThis speaks of its birth before Heaven and Earth,\nNone can rival its antiquity.\n\n**Chapter Five**\nHeaven and Earth are not kind,\nYet they treat all things as sacrificial straw-dogs;\nStraw-dogs are ritual implements—\nValued before use, discarded after.\nHeaven produces the five *qi* (村),\nYet its power is exhausted and flawed—\nThis resembles unkindness.\nThe Sage is not kind,\nYet he treats the people as sacrificial straw-dogs.\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nIs it not like the *tuqiao* (橐钥)?\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever producing more.\n*Tu* (橐) means to thrust aside;\n*Qiao* (钥) means the *yuelü* (乐钥) instrument.\nWithin the *tuqiao* lies a hollow, boundless space—\nThus it is empty and cannot be exhausted or bent;\nThus it moves and cannot be drained.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion,\nBetter to hold fast to the center.\nIf one truly holds to the center,\nSilence itself will be believed.\n\n**Chapter Six**\nThe *qi* of the Valley does not die—\nThe center is hollow, hence called *Valley* (谷);\nFathomless, hence called *Divine* (神).\nHeaven and Earth have limits,\nYet the *Dao* is limitless—\nHence it is said to not die.\nThis is called the *Xuan* Mother.",

      "original_text": "道德真经论卷之三竟 司马氏注 五十九章 治人事天，莫若啬。 省啬精神。 夫唯啬，是谓早复。 早复谓之重积德， 不远而复，不离於德，可以修身。 重积德则无不克。 念德不怠，庸可敌平。 无不克则莫知其极， 广运。 莫知其极，可以有国。 然后能保其国家。 有国之母，可以长久。 母谓存神育德。 是谓深根固蒂、长生久视之道。 六十章 治大国，若烹小鲜。 扰之则烂。 以道往天下，其鬼不神。 物各得其所，无妖灾。 非其鬼不神，其神不伤人； 寒暑风雨，变化生成。 非其神不伤人，圣人亦不伤人。 圣人与鬼神合其吉凶。 夫两不相伤，故德交归焉。 民，神之主也。 圣人不伤人，则神亦不伤矣。 六十－章 大国下流，天下之交，天下之牝。 交犹归聚也，言大国所以为王霸，下流所以为江海，皆以此。 牝常以静胜牡，以其静为之下。 覆解牝之为德。 故大国以下小国，则取小国； 小国以下大国，则取大国。 故或下以取，或下而取。 以取取人，而取为人所取。 大国不过欲兼畜人，小国不过欲入事人。 两者各得其所欲，故大者宜为下。 畏天者保其国，乐天者保天下。 六十二章 道者，万物之奥也， 妙万物而为言。 善人之所宝， 守而用之。 不善人之所保。 依於有道以自安。 美言可以市，尊行可以加人。 美而言之，可以使人从教，若市之得物。 尊而行之，可以使人心服，叉不为人下。 人之不善，何弃之有？ 所贵於道者，为其兼容敦化，若中者弃不中，才者弃不才，不得为有德。 故立天子，置三公， 立君以司牧其民，置辅以师保其君。 虽有拱璧以先驷马，不如坐进此道。 拱璧，璧大如拱也。 古者进物，叉有以先之。 宝用有尽，道用无穷。 古之所以贵此道者，何不日求以得，有罪以免邪？ 故为天下贵。 有求而循道者，无不得。 有过而从道者，无不免。 六十三章 为无为，事无事，味无味。 大小多少，报怨以德。 视小若大，视少若多，犯而不校。 图难於其易，为大於其细。 天下难事必作於易，天下大事必作於细。 是以圣人终不为大，故能成其大。 兢兢业业，一日二日万几，故能无为而治。 夫轻诺必寡信， 故子路无宿诺。 多易必多难。 小人先易而后难。 是以圣人由难之，故终无难矣。 君子先难而后易。 六十四章 其安易持，其未兆易谋，其脆易破，其微易散。 为之於未有，治之於，未乱。 合抱之木，生於豪末； 九层之台，起於累土； 里之行，始於足下。 皆言防微慎始。 为者败之， 伤自然。 执者失之。 滞於物。 是以圣人无为故无败， 无成无亏。 无执故无失。 无丧无得。 民之从事，常於几成而败之，慎终如始，则元败事。 是以圣人欲不欲，不贵难得之货； 圣人所欲者，不欲也，故不贵珍奇。 学不学，复众人之所过，以辅万物之自然而不敢为。 众人用心过分，更成赘疣，故人所学者在於不学，以复众人之所过。 万物生成，皆不出自然，圣人但以辅之，不敢强有所为也。 六十五章 古之善为道者，非以明民，将以愚之。 去华务实，还淳反朴。 民之难治，以其智多。 奸诈乱政。 故以智治国，国之贼．、 上下相欺。 不以智治国，国之福。 王道正直。 知此两者，亦楷式也。 常知楷式，是谓玄德。 知用智不若不用，非有精微之德，其　孰能与於此。",

early.\nReturning early is called *accumulating virtue*—\nNot distant, yet returning,\nNot estranged from virtue,\nOne may thus refine oneself.\n*Accumulate virtue* and nothing shall you fail to overcome.\n*Diligently uphold virtue* and even the ordinary may rival the noble.\nIf nothing fails you, none shall know your limits—\n*Universal efficacy*.\nIf none know your limits, you may have a realm.\nThen you may safeguard your realm.\nThe *root* of having a realm,\nMay endure long.\n*The root* refers to *nurturing the spirit and cultivating virtue*.\nThis is called the *Dao/Way of deep-rooted stability and enduring longevity*.\n\n**Chapter 60: Governing Great Realms, Like Poaching Small Fish.**\nDisturb them and they spoil.\n*Advancing with the Dao* into the world,\nTheir *ghosts* shall not be *mysterious*.\nThings each find their place—\nNo *portents* or calamities.\nNot that their *ghosts* are not *mysterious*—\nTheir *mysteriousness* does not harm people;\nCold and heat, wind and rain—\nTransforming, giving birth.\nNot that their *mysteriousness* does not harm people—\nThe Sage also does not harm people.\nThe Sage *harmonizes* with *ghosts* and *spirits* in their auspicious and inauspicious.\nSince both do not harm each other,\nVirtue *intermingles* and returns.\nThe people are the *master* of the *spirit*—\nIf the Sage does not harm people,\nThen the *spirit* shall not harm either.\n\n**Chapter 60: Great Realms Flow Downward.**\nThey are the *confluence* of the world,\nThe *female* of the world.\n*The confluence* is like gathering—\nGreat realms thus become *king* or *conqueror*,\nFlowing downward like rivers and seas.\nThe *female* always overcomes the *male* through stillness,\nIts stillness lies in its yielding.\n*Explain* the *female* as virtue.\nThus, great realms yield to small realms,\nAnd take small realms;\nSmall realms yield to great realms,\nAnd take great realms.\nThus, sometimes yielding to take,\nSometimes yielding yet taken.\nTaking to take from others,\nYet taken by others.\nGreat realms seek only to *encompass and nourish* people,\nSmall realms seek only to *enter and serve* others.\nBoth gain what they desire,\nThus the great should properly yield.\n\nThose who *revere Heaven* safeguard their realm,\nThose who *delight in Heaven* safeguard the world.\n\n**Chapter 61: The Dao/Way, the Mystery of All Things.**\nIt *permeates* all things and speaks.\nThe virtuous treasure it,\nGuard and employ it.\nThe unvirtuous hold onto it,\nRelying on the Dao/Way to find their ease.\n*Graceful words* may be *traded*,\n*Noble actions* may be *bestowed*.\n*Graceful words* may teach people,\nAs one gains goods in trade.\n*Noble actions* may make people submit,\nYet not be beneath them.\n\nPeople’s unvirtue—\nWhy should one abandon it?\nWhat is precious in the Dao/Way\nIs its *all-encompassing tolerance* and *profound transformation*,\nLike the *central* abandoning the *non-central*,\nThe *talented* abandoning the *untalented*—\nThus they do not become *virtuous*.\nHence, establishing the *Son of Heaven*,\nSetting up the *Three Exalted Ministers*,\nEstablishing a *lord* to tend his people,\nSetting up *assistants* to guide and protect his lord.\nThough one has *jewel-arches* and *four-horse chariots* to present,\nIt is not as good as *sitting and advancing* this Dao/Way.\n*Jewel-arches*—jewels as large as an arch.\nIn ancient times, gifts were presented,\nAnd some were given precedence.\nTreasures are finite,\nThe Dao/Way is boundless.\nWhy was this Dao/Way so treasured in antiquity?\nWas it not because one *seeks* and *obtains* it,\nAnd *avoids guilt* through it?\nThus, it is precious for the world.\nThose who *seek* and follow the Dao/Way\nShall have no failure.\nThose who *transgress* yet return to the Dao/Way\nShall have no guilt.\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao/Way of Non-Action.**\nDo without doing,\nAct without acting,\nTaste without tasting.\nGreat or small, many or few—\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nView the small as great,\nView the few as many—\nOffend yet do not retaliate.\nPlan the difficult in its ease,\nAchieve the great in its smallness.\nThe world’s difficult tasks must begin in ease,\nThe world’s great tasks must begin in smallness.\nThus, the Sage never seeks to do great,\nAnd so may complete the great.\nDiligent and earnest,\nA thousand concerns arise each day—\nThus may one govern without doing.\n\nLight promises bring little trust—\nHence *Zilu* made no idle vows.\nMuch ease brings much difficulty.\nThe petty begin with ease and end in difficulty.\nThus, the Sage *approaches* difficulty,\nAnd so shall have no difficulty at all.\nThe noble begin with difficulty and end in ease.\n\n**Chapter 63: The Sage’s Mastery of the Dao/Way.**\nIts ease is hard to maintain,\nIts unseen signs are hard to plan,\nIts fragility is hard to break,\nIts subtlety is hard to disperse.\nAct before it exists,\nGovern before chaos arises.\nA tree as thick as one’s embrace,\nGrows from a tiny sprout;\nA nine-tiered tower,\nRises from piled earth;\nA journey of a thousand *li*,\nBegins beneath one’s feet.\nAll speak of *preventing the subtle* and *cautiously beginning*.\n\nThose who *act* shall ruin it,\nHarming *Nature*.\nThose who *grasp* shall lose it,\nStagnating in things.\nThus, the Sage does without doing,\nAnd so has no ruin—\nNo gain, no loss.\nNo grasping, no loss.\nNo losing, no gaining.\nThe people’s undertakings\nOften fail when nearly complete—\n*Be cautious at the end as at the beginning*,\nAnd no ruin shall come of affairs.\n\nThus, the Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures;\nWhat the Sage desires,\nIs what is not desired—\nThus, he does not prize rare and strange things.\n*Learn without learning*,\nRepairing the errors of the multitude,\nTo *assist* the *natural* unfolding of all things,\nYet daring not to *act*.\nThe multitude *overuse* their minds,\nCreating *superfluous growths*—\nThus, what people should *learn*\nIs to *not learn*,\nTo repair the multitude’s errors.\nAll things *give birth and grow*,\nNone escape *Nature*—\nThe Sage merely *assists* them,\nDaring not to *force* anything.\n\n**Chapter 64: The Sage’s Wisdom in Governance.**\nThe wise in ancient times\nDid not *enlighten* the people—\nThey sought to *bewilder* them.\nAbandon ornamentation, embrace substance,\nReturn to simplicity, revert to *primordial* purity.\nThe people’s difficulty in governance\nLies in their *excessive cleverness*—\nDeceit and trickery disrupt the polity.\nThus, governing with *cleverness*,\nThe realm’s *bane*—\nAbove and below deceive each other.\nNot governing with *cleverness*,\nThe realm’s *blessing*.\nThe *Way of Kings* is straight.\nKnowing these two,\nOne may set the *model*.\nAlways knowing the *model*,\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\nKnowing to use *cleverness* is not as good as not using it—\nWithout *profound and subtle virtue*,\nWho could *assist* in this?",
      "overlap_context": "world has no pure disaster, no pure fortune.\nRectitude becomes the unusual,\nGoodness becomes the bizarre.\nNot only disaster and fortune invert thus—\nEvil and rectitude, good and bad\nAlso constantly reverse,\nAll by the principle that extremes invert.\nThe people’s confusion\nHas lasted long indeed.\nNone in the world comprehend it.\nThus, the Sage is square yet does not cut,\nSharp yet not harsh,\n*Year*—to scrape.\nStraight yet not domineering,\nBrilliant yet not dazzling—\nNone desire to reach extremes.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 66: The Dao of the Sage’s Humility**\n*Mysterious Virtue* is profound and distant,\nOpposed to things yet in perfect accord—\nThus attaining the *Great Harmony*.\n\nAll creatures demand *cleverness*,\nYet those who possess *Mysterious Virtue* alone despise it—\nThough opposed to things, they align with the *Way*.\n\nThe rivers and seas become kings of all valleys\nBecause they excel in yielding.\nThus the sage, desiring to lead others,\nSpeaks with humility;\nDesiring to precede others,\nActs with deference.\n\nThus, though placed above, none grow weary of him,\nThough placed before, none are harmed by him—\nHence the world willingly follows without tiring.\n\nBecause he does not contend,\nNone can contend with him.\n\nFullness invites loss; humility invites gain.\n\n**Chapter 67: The Three Treasures**\nAll under heaven say my *Way* is vast,\nYet I seem unworthy.\n*Worthy* means resemblance—\nMy words differ from the masses.\n\nOnly because it is vast does it seem unworthy.\nIf it were long worthy, it would be trifling.\n\nI have three treasures; guard and hold them:\nFirst, *compassion*;\nSecond, *frugality*;\nThird, *not daring to lead the world*.\n\n*Compassion* makes one courageous—\nThe virtuous must be bold.\n*Frugality* makes one expansive—\nModeration brings abundance.\nNot daring to lead the world,\nOne may become the vessel’s master.\n\nThe vessel’s master is like establishing law—\nThe teacher of all, hence called the vessel’s master.\n\nNow abandon *compassion* and its boldness,\nAbandon *frugality* and its abundance,\nAbandon deference and take precedence—\nDeath will follow.\nYou will be harmed by things.\n\n*Compassion* in battle brings victory,\nIn defense brings security.\nThe virtuous are the people’s refuge.\nHeaven aids them with *compassion* as their shield—\nNo one dares to harm them.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Virtue of Non-Contention**\nThe skilled warrior is not fierce,\nBut subdues through *virtue*.\nThe skilled fighter does not rage,\nOnly seeks resolution.\nThe skilled victor does not contend—\nHe bends others’ arms without battle.\n\nThe skilled ruler serves below,\nWinning their affection.\n\nThis is called the *virtue of non-contention*,\nThe *power of using people*,\nThe *harmony with Heaven’s ancient extreme*.\n\n*Virtue* aligns with Heaven—\nSince the birth of the people, none surpasses it.\n\n**Chapter 69: The Art of War**\nIn wielding arms, one says:\nI dare not be the aggressor but only the defender.\n*The aggressor* means bearing strong arms as one’s duty.\n*The defender* means others press upon me, and I respond unwillingly.\n\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot—\nHumility without blame.\n\nThis is called *action without action*—\nNo action yet it arrives.\n*Seizing without arms*—\nNo arms yet can seize others.\n*No enemy*—\nThe enemy surrenders without resistance.\n*Grasping without weapons*—\nNo weapons yet complete victory.\n\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—\nUnderestimating the enemy risks losing my treasures.\n*Treasures* mean the three treasures.\n\nThus, when armies clash, the compassionate prevail.\nDirect speech without contention\nMakes one pitied by all.\n\n**Chapter 70: The Simplicity of the Dao**\nMy words are easy to know,\nEasy to practice.\nSimple and unadorned—\nYet none under heaven know or practice them.\n\n*Focused unity*—\nWords have their root;\n*Essential substance*—\nAffairs have their master.\n*Return to the origin*—\nOnly the ignorant are unknown to me.\nKnowledge reveals the *Way*.\n\nFew know me, thus I am honored.\nThe *Way* is vast, so few comprehend it.\nThus the sage wears coarse robes while cherishing jade,\nHiding brilliance to nurture integrity.\n\n**Chapter 71: The Disease of Knowing**\nKnowing yet pretending ignorance—*benefit*.\nIgnoring yet pretending knowledge—*illness*.\nKnowing as if ignorant—\nQuickly invites resentment.\nIgnoring yet forcing knowledge—\nInvites misfortune.\n\nOnly because of this illness\nDoes one avoid illness.\nThe sage’s freedom from illness\nLies in treating illness as illness—\nThus he remains unharmed.\n\nIf people know their own illness,\nThey will not suffer greatly.\n\n**Chapter 72: The Sage’s Contentment**\nThe people do not fear death—\nHow can death frighten them?\nSeeing profit, they forget life—\nThis is not fearing death.\n\nIf one makes people constantly fear death,\nAnd those who act strangely—\nI could seize and kill them—\nWho would dare?\n\n*Strange* means *perverse*.\nThere are always those charged with killing.\nHeaven, intending to remove evil,\nMust use one hand.\n\nTo substitute for those who kill is like\nA carpenter’s apprentice wielding the axe—\nFew escape uninjured.\n*Willfully causing harm*.\n\nThe sage does not dwell where he rests,\nNor chooses where to settle.\nHe is not sated by his food,\nNor dazzled by his garments.\n\nOnly because he is not sated\nDoes he not grow sated.\nNot sated by things,\nNor sated by things.\n\nThus the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nUnknown by others yet unperturbed.\nHe values himself but does not exalt himself,\nHumility to nurture himself.\n\nThus he discards that and takes this—\nDiscards external allure, takes inner joy.\n\n**Chapter 73: The Peril of Boldness**\nBoldness in daring leads to death,\nBoldness in restraint leads to life.\nKnowing these two,\nOne may gain or lose.\n\nWhat does Heaven abhor?\nWho knows its reason?\nThus the sage finds it difficult.\n\nPeople know this and avoid death to seek life—*benefit*.\nYet some, knowing this, hasten their own death—*harm*.\nIs this not how Heaven abhors people?\n\nWho can grasp its intent?\n\nThus the sage does not dare lightly speak of Heaven’s *Way*.\nHeaven’s *Way*:\nDoes not contend yet prevails,\nLets things be natural—none can defy it.\nDoes not speak yet responds—\nFollows its course, answering with fortune or calamity.\nDoes not summon yet they come,\nDoes not hasten yet it arrives,\nDoes not move yet it reaches.\nEffortless yet
