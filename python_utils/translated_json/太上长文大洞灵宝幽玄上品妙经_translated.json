Author unknown, likely composed during the Tang dynasty.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter One: The Initial Separation of Heaven and Earth**\nThe Dao speaks: Before heaven and earth divided, there first existed the Supreme Ultimate and Primordial Simplicity. The name of the Originator was established, and the positions of yin and yang were determined. Yang, being light and pure, became heaven; yin, being heavy and turbid, became earth. Yang ascended and rounded above; yin descended and squared below.\n\nAt the outset, within the chaos, transformation occurred within the vast primeval mist. The three yangs converged, the six qi intermingled, giving form to the myriad things within the indistinct, and birthing the thousand spirits beyond being and non-being. Some gestated in wombs, some hatched from eggs, some emerged from moisture through illusion—manifesting the ten thousand images in the high heavens, nurturing the hundred rivers upon the vast earth. Such is the work of creation.\n\nOnce heaven and earth were sundered, the harmonious qi took effect. Yang essence coalesced into the radiant sun; yin essence congealed into the luminous moon. The four directions and eight extremities spread forth, wind and rain bestowed moisture, the four seasons followed their course, snow and frost transformed things, renewing the old and altering the new from dusk to dawn.\n\nThus, transformation gave rise to humanity—some male, some female—all born in accord with heaven and earth. Men, being yang, correspond to the Dao of heaven; women, being yin, correspond to the Dao of earth. Above, heaven’s yang is clear and light, matching men below; earth’s yin is heavy and turbid, matching women. Heaven and earth take the sun and moon as their essence; men and women take essence and blood as their treasure. All emulate the function of heaven and earth and must endure as heaven and earth endure. The Dao of long life and enduring vision shares the same function as the yin and yang of heaven and earth.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter Two: The Resonance of Human Spirit**\nThe Dao speaks: Humanity is the transformation of the qi of heaven and earth. Spirit is the function of the qi of yin and yang; form is the dwelling of spirit and qi. The yin and yang souls are the spirits of essence and blood—these two spirits are the chiefs of the myriad spirits.\n\nThus, those who cultivate and nourish themselves, if they can preserve spirit and nurture qi, secure blood and refine essence, may fully realize the principle of long life. If the human body suffers illness, the form is incomplete; if the form is incomplete, qi cannot abide; if qi cannot abide, spirit is unsettled, and life is not long. To prolong human life, one must nurture the dwelling of form, secure essence and blood, refine spirit and qi, and pacify the hun and po souls—only then can long life be attained.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter Three: The Creation of the Myriad Things**\nThe Dao speaks: As heaven and earth ascend and descend, the harmonious qi takes form, and all things experience flourishing and decay. All contain the one qi, enabling transformation—whether metal, stone, grass, or wood; birds, beasts, fish, or insects—all are the creations of heaven and earth.\n\nAmong the myriad things, only humanity is most noble, the chief of all things. The head is round, the feet are square—above yang, below yin—all in accord with heaven and earth. Just as heaven has wind and rain, humans have blood and qi; as heaven has sun and moon, humans have eyes; as heaven has the ten thousand images, humans have the ten thousand spirits; as heaven has the eight extremities, humans have the eight vessels; as heaven has the five phases, humans have the five viscera; as heaven has the four seasons, humans have the four limbs. Earth has mountains and peaks, humans have bones and joints; earth has grasses and trees, humans have hair; earth has rivers and lakes, humans have blood vessels. None of these fail to correspond to heaven and earth—humanity is the chief of the myriad things.\n\nIf humans do not receive from heaven and connect with earth, embracing yin while holding yang, how could they alone, within heaven and earth, move in accord with the creation of heaven and earth? For heaven can move, earth can be still; yang can create, and yin can transform. Thus, heaven descends and earth ascends, their interaction giving birth to the myriad things. If humans descend above and ascend below, the myriad things become numinous—this is responding to heaven to generate the myriad things and responding to humanity to generate the myriad spirits. Heaven employs yin and yang; humans employ spirit and qi. By refining qi to congeal spirit, spirit and qi unite, and with form complete, long life is assured.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter Four: The Mutual Embrace of Yin and Yang**\nThe Dao speaks: Heaven descends yang qi to earth; earth ascends yin qi to heaven. Heaven exchanges yin essence with the sun; men emit yin qi within the yang of yang—this is called true lead. Women emit yang qi within the yin of yin—this is called true mercury.\n\nThus, when heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born; when sun and moon unite, the thousand spirits transform. Yin and yang embrace, outer and inner complete each other; south and north converge, above and below correspond; east and west pair, left and right unite, inner and outer harmonize, spirit and qi intermingle. Thereby, yin attains yang and becomes numinous; yang attains yin and becomes sagely. Humans attain qi and live; spirit attains form and becomes whole. Those who cultivate this will surely attain long life.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter Five: The Transformation of the Five Phases**\nThe Dao speaks: The five phases are in heaven as the five phases, on earth as the five peaks, in the world as the five constants, and in humans as the five viscera.\n\nThe transformation of the five phases involves metal and wood mutually generating and overcoming, water and fire pairing and uniting—only earth can transform. All things, by attaining this, may be completed; the body, by attaining this, may become numinous. Circulating qi through the three fields can produce the great medicine of the five phases. The golden elixir is the transformation of the qi of the five phases; the five fluids are the ascent and descent of the five phases; the qi of heaven is the function of the five phases.\n\nHeaven and earth are the ancestors of the five phases; sun and moon are their lineage. The celestial circuit is the Dao of the five phases; the eight trigrams are their gateway. The great medicine of the five phases lies entirely in the function of the human body.\n\nThus, the *Scripture of the Unseen Correspondence* states: \"Heaven has five thieves—those who perceive them prosper; those who fail to recognize them perish.\"\n\nIf one cultivates the function of the five phases according to the method and maintains the practice, one may surely attain longevity.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Formation of Images in the Eight Trigrams**\nThe Dao states: Heaven employs the eight trigrams to correspond to the eight directions.\nFu Xi drew the eight trigrams, designating the northwest as *Qian* ☰, associated with metal, embodying the image of three yang.\nThe southwest as *Kun* ☷, associated with earth, embodying the image of three yin.\nThree yang descending to generate one yin forms *Xun* ☴, located in the southeast, associated with wind.\nThree yin descending to generate one yang forms *Zhen* ☳, associated with thunder, located due east.\nThree yang ascending to generate one yin forms *Dui* ☱, associated with marsh, located due west.\nThree yin ascending to generate one yang forms *Gen* ☶, associated with mountain, located northeast.\nThree yang generating one yin in the center forms *Li* ☲, associated with fire, located due south.\nThree yin generating one yang in the center forms *Kan* ☵, associated with water, located due north.\nOnce the eight trigrams form their images, each aligns with a direction and may correspond to the five viscera of humans:\n*Qian* (Heaven) to the large intestine, *Kan* to the kidneys, *Gen* to the bladder, *Zhen* to the liver, *Xun* to the gallbladder, *Li* to the heart, *Kun* to the abdomen, and *Dui* to the lungs.\nThese eight gates all possess methods of qi. If cultivated, qi flows through the five viscera and six bowels, uniting with the spirit-qi, thereby prolonging life.\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Differentiation of Male and Female Forms**\nThe Dao states: The male is the infant, and the differentiation of form is true lead.\nThe female is the maiden, and the differentiation of form is true mercury.\nThe male is born in the north and flourishes in the *Kan* palace;\nThe female is born in the south and flourishes in the *Li* palace.\nIf male and female unite in the central palace, the yellow sprout is born within. Once the yellow sprout arises, it disperses through the twelve meridians, branching into the hundred vessels, ascending to the palace of the mud-pill, descending to the sea of essence-qi, and traversing the gate of the bright hall, filling the three fields with qi and clarifying the spirit within the chamber.\nOriginally one male and one female, they differentiate into a thousand and ten thousand spirits.\nThus, lead and mercury form the body; *Kan* and *Li* are their names; the golden elixir is their essence; dragon and tiger are their forms.\nAll arise from the transformation of a single qi into numinous spirits. When merit and practice are complete, one may surely attain longevity.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Refinement of the Body through the Golden Elixir**\nThe Dao states: Metal is the position of Venus, the qi of the west.\nIt emerges from the designation of primordial simplicity, thus embodying the image of the Great One.\nThe elixir is the position of the Great Ultimate, the qi of the south.\nIt emerges from the position of the Great Mystery, thus embodying the image of the Great One.\nMetal generates water, hence the treasure is seen within water; wood generates fire, hence it is called the refinement of truth within fire.\nThus, metal emerges from water, and fire is seen within water, whereupon the elixir is refined, named cinnabar.\nIf earth is obtained, the yellow sprout grows naturally, the jade flower blooms fragrantly, the jasper tree reaches the heavens, the winter forest rises from the earth, the golden fluid bathes the crown, silver waves surge through the passes, wind and clouds converge, and the spirit and essence flourish—all through the Dao of refining the body with the golden elixir.\nYet water and fire are difficult to unite, metal and water are difficult to harmonize, the great medicine is difficult to encounter, and the true principle is difficult to meet. Countless practitioners often fall into perdition.\nIf one seeks to attain truth, one must master the Dao of the golden elixir, thereby surely attaining longevity.\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Perfection of the Sacred Embryo**\nThe Dao states: The sacred is the numinous and holy;\nThe embryo is the transformation of qi;\nThe true is one’s original nature.\nThus, humans form the true qi through their original nature, thereby completing the embryo, allowing the primordial qi to transform and become the true spirit.\nOnce the spirit is numinous, one may enter the sacred.\nThe sacred ascends to the high heavens, descends to the deep earth, spans south and north, east and west, permeating the six directions without obstruction, circulating throughout the world—this is called divine penetration.\nSuch freedom arises from humans cultivating truth and refining qi to perfect the sacred embryo.\nIf one is deluded and awakens not, practices falsely and does not train, seeks a short life rather than a long one, and perceives the deviant rather than the upright—such a person will never perfect the sacred embryo.\nTo perfect the sacred embryo, one must focus on the body and life, employing the method of refining qi to generate spirit, thereby surely attaining longevity.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Ascension and Feather Transformation**\nThe Dao states: Flight begins with the gate of pure tranquility, the principle of wondrous function, the refinement of the true primordial qi, the sincerity of non-action, the Dao of lightness and clarity, becoming the guest of feather transformation.\nFlight is like clouds, roaming the world without limit;\nAscension is from below to above, like qi rising into the empty sky, drifting without dispersion.\nUpon reaching this state, the body becomes a companion of the immortals, dwelling on Mount Penglai as a guest of the jade grotto, a visitor to the golden gate, enjoying boundless longevity, donning the six-zhu robe, riding the five-colored clouds, traversing the ten isles.\nOne may drive a dragon chariot or jeweled carriage, wander jade grottoes and golden terraces, where flowers bloom unfading through the four seasons, and the music of immortality plays for myriad days.\nOne may indulge in measured luxury, enjoying boundless wealth and honor.\nHow is this attained?\nThrough human cultivation.\nOne draws near to heaven and distances oneself from hell.\nIf one does not cultivate or practice, lacking Dao and virtue, one will surely draw near to hell and distance oneself from heaven.\nNow, speaking of the affairs of the celestial palace, not even one part in ten thousand has been described.\nBriefly describing the realm of hell, there is a city called Dengduoluo, where King Yama, also known as the Northern Emperor of the Dark Capital, resides, governing the eight grottoes of yin spirits within the eighteen iron cities, where life and death unfold.\nIn the various hells, flames blaze fiercely above, while vast icy cold lies below; to the left stand a thousand rod-bearing mountains, to the right a thousand forests of sword trees—enduring ceaseless suffering. I dare not speak further, lest hearing it pains your heart and disturbs your spirit.\nOnly then will you know that cultivating the Dao is the greatest good, and one may surely ascend and undergo feather transformation to become a celestial immortal.\n\nIf one does not cultivate merit and accumulate virtuous deeds, one will sink into hell—when will they ever escape? Today, by fortunate encounter with my transformative teachings, I transmit the scriptures and the Dao, bestow the method and the elixir. With steadfast will and sincere heart, you may surely prolong life.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: On the Method of the True One**\nThe Dao speaks: The method of the True One is the yin of Heaven and Earth, the qi of the myriad things, the nature of humans, the foundation of the Dao, the root of virtue, the ancestor of the body, the origin of life, the essence of the dragon, the form of the tiger, the name of essence, the source of blood, the head of lead, the crown of mercury. When it meets the hun-soul, it becomes three; when it encounters the po-soul, it becomes seven. This is the source of the True One. Though one may know the name of cultivating the True, what is the method of cultivating the True?\nThe master answers: Simply refine the qi of the cinnabar field within the body to strengthen it, and generate the natural spirit in its completeness. Within the twelve hours, guard the primordial qi of Heaven as it enters the palace of the cinnabar field. Let the heart be free of chaotic thoughts, the exterior free of distractions—neither exiting nor entering, neither coming nor going. The spirit settles and finds peace of its own accord. This is the method of the True One.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: On the Method of the Union of the Two Qi**\nThe Dao speaks: The functions of the ascending and descending yin and yang qi of high and low—above, they surge into the vast emptiness; below, they traverse the profound darkness. Wind and water, springs and clouds, mists and fogs—all are the works of the two qi of yin and yang. Even the human body is transformed by yin and yang. Though one may cultivate and refine, it is still the transformation of human yin and yang qi. What, then, is the method of refining my qi?\nListen to this one method: Above the central regulator within the human body belongs to Heaven’s qi, applied to yang; below the central regulator belongs to Earth’s qi, applied to yin. If one guides the upper and lower yin and yang qi to meet and unite in the central palace, one may surely form the sacred embryo. Once the golden elixir is congealed, transformation occurs naturally. One qi can transform into ten, ten into a hundred; one return can transform into a thousand, a second return into ten thousand, a third return into thirty-six thousand spirits in their completeness. Thus, if one does not cultivate, there is no merit; without merit, there is no accomplishment; without accomplishment, there is no completeness—then one cannot ascend as an immortal, and the body will surely perish. But if the heart is resolute, success is achieved; with success, the spirit is complete. How can this not be trusted? If you follow my method, you may surely prolong your years.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: On the Method of the Three Origins, Upper and Lower**\nThe Dao speaks: Heaven, Earth, and Humanity are the origins of the Three Powers. Essence, qi, and spirit are the numinous aspects of the Three Origins, the functions of the upper, middle, and lower palaces. The three cinnabar fields are the means by which the spirit is generated. How may the three fields be filled and the ten thousand spirits made numinous?\nListen to this one method: If the heart is not chaotic, the nature becomes numinous of itself; if thoughts do not move, the spirit becomes complete of itself; if qi is not turbid, the body becomes light of itself; if essence does not scatter, the Dao becomes clear of itself; if merit is not interrupted, one ascends of oneself. I teach you: Treasure the Three Origins, pay homage to the Jade Capital, and with a sincere heart, you may attain longevity.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: Preface on the Method of the Four Proper Responses**\nThe Dao speaks: The Four Proper are the seasons; the sequence is the response to the commands of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Spring governs birth, summer governs growth, autumn governs fruition, and winter governs storage. What is the method of cultivating the Four Proper in humans?\nListen to this one method: In spring, refine the qi of the liver and gallbladder, corresponding to the positions of Jia and Yi Wood. In summer, refine the qi of the heart, corresponding to the positions of Bing and Ding Fire. In autumn, refine the qi of the lungs, corresponding to the positions of Geng and Xin Metal. In winter, refine the qi of the kidneys, corresponding to the positions of Ren and Gui Water. Thus, water and fire face each other, metal and wood unite; the central palace gathers them, and the four phases and five agents all achieve transformation. After one thousand days, the lesser merit is accomplished, and the golden elixir congeals; after two thousand days, the central palace is perfected, and the sacred embryo becomes numinous; after three thousand days, the great merit is complete, and the mortal bones transform. When the bones transform, the earthly name is erased; when the celestial name is inscribed, the body undergoes feather transformation and returns to Penglai. If you cultivate with a sincere heart according to my teachings, how can you not prolong your years and attain longevity?\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: On the Method of the Five Agents Matching the Viscera**\nThe Dao speaks: Heaven, with the yang qi of the five agents, corresponds to the human viscera; Earth, with the yin qi of the five agents, corresponds to the human bowels. Thus, metal, wood, water, fire, and earth transmit to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, corresponding to Bing, Shen, Wu, Geng, and Ren. These correspond to the transformations of yin and yang qi. It is also said that the large intestine, small intestine, stomach, and bladder correspond to Yi, Ding, Ji, Xin, and Gui. Above is the triple burner, below is the Gate of Life—all are the unions of yin and yang. What is the method of their application?\nThe answer: Transmit the qi of the True One into the five viscera to assist their essence and blood, nourish their hun and po souls, and generate spirit and qi—thus prolonging life.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: On the Method of the Six Lines Uniting with the Six Qi**\nThe Dao speaks: The six lines are the three yin and three yang. The first is lesser yang, the second is yang brightness, the third is greater yang. The first is reverting yin, the second is lesser yin, the third is greater yin—these are the six lines uniting with the six qi. What is the function of the six lines?\nThe answer: Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each have ninety days; a year has three hundred and sixty days, with sixty days as one qi, so the six lines complete one cycle. The movement follows the qi’s turning, and the qi follows the movement’s progression. If one comprehends this principle, even within a single day, there are six qi. Yin and Mao are the first qi, corresponding to lesser yang; Chen and Si are the second qi, corresponding to yang brightness; Wu and Wei are the third qi, corresponding to greater yang; Shen and You are the fourth qi, corresponding to reverting yin; Xu and Hai are the fifth qi, corresponding to lesser yin; Zi and Chou are the sixth qi, corresponding to greater yin. It is also said that within the human viscera and bowels, yang moves on the left, and yin moves on the right.\n\nThe six divisions of blood and vessels circulate with the qi, completing one cycle each day, traversing the six qi to flow throughout the body. If one can apply this, one may surely prolong life.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: On the Method of the Sevenfold Reversion Elixir**\nThe Dao states: The sevenfold reversion corresponds to the pivot of Heaven and Earth, circulating within the twelve palaces. In the twelve hours of day and night, from the Zi hour to the Wu hour, the intestines revert to yin. As for its application in human cultivation, how is it employed? Simply guide the original true qi from below to revert upward—this is called \"yin reverting to yang.\" Then, return the true original qi from above back downward—this is called \"yang reverting to yin.\" The six yin and six yang converge at the Yellow Court, returning to the Cinnabar Field, where spirit and qi are both fulfilled; thus, it is called the reverted elixir. Heaven descends with yang, Earth ascends with yin, and humans harmonize with qi—all follow this pattern of creation. The *Book of Changes* says: \"After seven days, it returns.\" One must achieve the sevenfold reversion. Therefore, if one reverts the true unified qi in accordance with the times, one may surely prolong life.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Golden Liquor and Reverted Elixir**\nThe Dao states: The method of refining the body with golden liquor is the gateway to cultivation and the root of embryonic breathing since ancient times. It is the pivot of spirit and qi, the ancestral origin of water and fire. To refine form and spirit, first refine the heart. When the heart is open, wisdom arises; when wisdom arises, the method becomes clear; when the method is unified, merit is accomplished; when merit is accomplished, one becomes an immortal, shedding mortal bones to attain transcendence. Without this, how else could it be achieved? If one refines the golden elixir within the dwelling of the body, one may surely prolong life.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: On the Method of Golden Elixir, Embryonic Transformation, and Transcendence**\nThe Dao states: The Golden Elixir is the fulfillment of nine years. Embryonic transformation of the spirit is the process of the mortal becoming sacred. Just as coarse stone nurtures jade within the clam, and the womb nurtures a pearl, mortal flesh nurtures the sacred embryo. Within the false lies the true, within the numinous lies treasure, within the shallow lies depth, and within the noble lies the immortal. One becomes good by drawing near to goodness, evil by drawing near to evil, wise by drawing near to wisdom, and foolish by drawing near to folly. Yet if one neither draws near to wisdom nor folly, the Great Dao surely grants long life.\n\n*The Supreme, Most Wondrous, Mysterious, and Profound Upper Scripture of the Numinous Treasure of the Great Cavern concludes.*",

Men, being yang, correspond to the Dao of heaven; women, being yin, correspond to the Dao of earth. Above, heaven’s yang is clear and light, matching men below; earth’s yin is heavy and turbid, matching women. Heaven and earth take the sun and moon as their essence; men and women take essence and blood as their treasure. All emulate the function of heaven and earth and must endure as heaven and earth endure. The Dao of long life and enduring vision shares the same function as the yin and yang of heaven and earth.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter Two: The Resonance of Human Spirit**\nThe Dao speaks: Humanity is the transformation of the qi of heaven and earth. Spirit is the function of the qi of yin and yang; form is the dwelling of spirit and qi. The yin and yang souls are the spirits of essence and blood—these two spirits are the chiefs of the myriad spirits.\n\nThus, those who cultivate and nourish themselves, if they can preserve spirit and nurture qi, secure blood and refine essence, may fully realize the principle of long life. If the human body suffers illness, the form is incomplete; if the form is incomplete, qi cannot abide; if qi cannot abide, spirit is unsettled, and life is not long. To prolong human life, one must nurture the dwelling of form, secure essence and blood, refine spirit and qi, and pacify the hun and po souls—only then can long life be attained.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter Three: The Creation of the Myriad Things**\nThe Dao speaks: As heaven and earth ascend and descend, the harmonious qi takes form, and all things experience flourishing and decay. All contain the one qi, enabling transformation—whether metal, stone, grass, or wood; birds, beasts, fish, or insects—all are the creations of heaven and earth.\n\nAmong the myriad things, only humanity is most noble, the chief of all things. The head is round, the feet are square—above yang, below yin—all in accord with heaven and earth. Just as heaven has wind and rain, humans have blood and qi; as heaven has sun and moon, humans have eyes; as heaven has the ten thousand images, humans have the ten thousand spirits; as heaven has the eight extremities, humans have the eight vessels; as heaven has the five phases, humans have the five viscera; as heaven has the four seasons, humans have the four limbs. Earth has mountains and peaks, humans have bones and joints; earth has grasses and trees, humans have hair; earth has rivers and lakes, humans have blood vessels. None of these fail to correspond to heaven and earth—humanity is the chief of the myriad things.\n\nIf humans do not receive from heaven and connect with earth, embracing yin while holding yang, how could they alone, within heaven and earth, move in accord with the creation of heaven and earth? For heaven can move, earth can be still; yang can create, and yin can transform. Thus, heaven descends and earth ascends, their interaction giving birth to the myriad things. If humans descend above and ascend below, the myriad things become numinous—this is responding to heaven to generate the myriad things and responding to humanity to generate the myriad spirits. Heaven employs yin and yang; humans employ spirit and qi. By refining qi to congeal spirit, spirit and qi unite, and with form complete, long life is assured.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter Four: The Mutual Embrace of Yin and Yang**\nThe Dao speaks: Heaven descends yang qi to earth; earth ascends yin qi to heaven. Heaven exchanges yin essence with the sun; men emit yin qi within the yang of yang—this is called true lead. Women emit yang qi within the yin of yin—this is called true mercury.\n\nThus, when heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born; when sun and moon unite, the thousand spirits transform. Yin and yang embrace, outer and inner complete each other; south and north converge, above and below correspond; east and west pair, left and right unite, inner and outer harmonize, spirit and qi intermingle. Thereby, yin attains yang and becomes numinous; yang attains yin and becomes sagely. Humans attain qi and live; spirit attains form and becomes whole. Those who cultivate this will surely attain long life.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter Five: The Transformation of the Five Phases**\nThe Dao speaks: The five phases are in heaven as the five phases, on earth as the five peaks, in the world as the five constants, and in humans as the five viscera.\n\nThe transformation of the five phases involves metal and wood mutually generating and overcoming, water and fire pairing and uniting—only earth can transform. All things, by attaining this, may be completed; the body, by attaining this, may become numinous. Circulating qi through the three fields can produce the great medicine of the five phases. The golden elixir is the transformation of the qi of the five phases; the five fluids are the ascent and descent of the five phases; the qi of heaven is the function of the five phases.\n\nHeaven and earth are the ancestors of the five phases; sun and moon are their lineage. The celestial circuit is the Dao of the five phases; the eight trigrams are their gateway. The great medicine of the five phases lies entirely in the function of the human body.\n\nThus, the *Scripture of the Unseen Correspondence* states: \"Heaven has five thieves—those who perceive them prosper; those who fail to recognize them perish.\"",

      "translated_text": "If one cultivates the function of the five phases according to the method and maintains the practice, one may surely attain longevity.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Formation of Images in the Eight Trigrams**\nThe Dao states: Heaven employs the eight trigrams to correspond to the eight directions.\nFu Xi drew the eight trigrams, designating the northwest as *Qian* ☰, associated with metal, embodying the image of three yang.\nThe southwest as *Kun* ☷, associated with earth, embodying the image of three yin.\nThree yang descending to generate one yin forms *Xun* ☴, located in the southeast, associated with wind.\nThree yin descending to generate one yang forms *Zhen* ☳, associated with thunder, located due east.\nThree yang ascending to generate one yin forms *Dui* ☱, associated with marsh, located due west.\nThree yin ascending to generate one yang forms *Gen* ☶, associated with mountain, located northeast.\nThree yang generating one yin in the center forms *Li* ☲, associated with fire, located due south.\nThree yin generating one yang in the center forms *Kan* ☵, associated with water, located due north.\nOnce the eight trigrams form their images, each aligns with a direction and may correspond to the five viscera of humans:\n*Qian* (Heaven) to the large intestine, *Kan* to the kidneys, *Gen* to the bladder, *Zhen* to the liver, *Xun* to the gallbladder, *Li* to the heart, *Kun* to the abdomen, and *Dui* to the lungs.\nThese eight gates all possess methods of qi. If cultivated, qi flows through the five viscera and six bowels, uniting with the spirit-qi, thereby prolonging life.\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Differentiation of Male and Female Forms**\nThe Dao states: The male is the infant, and the differentiation of form is true lead.\nThe female is the maiden, and the differentiation of form is true mercury.\nThe male is born in the north and flourishes in the *Kan* palace;\nThe female is born in the south and flourishes in the *Li* palace.\nIf male and female unite in the central palace, the yellow sprout is born within. Once the yellow sprout arises, it disperses through the twelve meridians, branching into the hundred vessels, ascending to the palace of the mud-pill, descending to the sea of essence-qi, and traversing the gate of the bright hall, filling the three fields with qi and clarifying the spirit within the chamber.\nOriginally one male and one female, they differentiate into a thousand and ten thousand spirits.\nThus, lead and mercury form the body; *Kan* and *Li* are their names; the golden elixir is their essence; dragon and tiger are their forms.\nAll arise from the transformation of a single qi into numinous spirits. When merit and practice are complete, one may surely attain longevity.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Refinement of the Body through the Golden Elixir**\nThe Dao states: Metal is the position of Venus, the qi of the west.\nIt emerges from the designation of primordial simplicity, thus embodying the image of the Great One.\nThe elixir is the position of the Great Ultimate, the qi of the south.\nIt emerges from the position of the Great Mystery, thus embodying the image of the Great One.\nMetal generates water, hence the treasure is seen within water; wood generates fire, hence it is called the refinement of truth within fire.\nThus, metal emerges from water, and fire is seen within water, whereupon the elixir is refined, named cinnabar.\nIf earth is obtained, the yellow sprout grows naturally, the jade flower blooms fragrantly, the jasper tree reaches the heavens, the winter forest rises from the earth, the golden fluid bathes the crown, silver waves surge through the passes, wind and clouds converge, and the spirit and essence flourish—all through the Dao of refining the body with the golden elixir.\nYet water and fire are difficult to unite, metal and water are difficult to harmonize, the great medicine is difficult to encounter, and the true principle is difficult to meet. Countless practitioners often fall into perdition.\nIf one seeks to attain truth, one must master the Dao of the golden elixir, thereby surely attaining longevity.\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Perfection of the Sacred Embryo**\nThe Dao states: The sacred is the numinous and holy;\nThe embryo is the transformation of qi;\nThe true is one’s original nature.\nThus, humans form the true qi through their original nature, thereby completing the embryo, allowing the primordial qi to transform and become the true spirit.\nOnce the spirit is numinous, one may enter the sacred.\nThe sacred ascends to the high heavens, descends to the deep earth, spans south and north, east and west, permeating the six directions without obstruction, circulating throughout the world—this is called divine penetration.\nSuch freedom arises from humans cultivating truth and refining qi to perfect the sacred embryo.\nIf one is deluded and awakens not, practices falsely and does not train, seeks a short life rather than a long one, and perceives the deviant rather than the upright—such a person will never perfect the sacred embryo.\nTo perfect the sacred embryo, one must focus on the body and life, employing the method of refining qi to generate spirit, thereby surely attaining longevity.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Ascension and Feather Transformation**\nThe Dao states: Flight begins with the gate of pure tranquility, the principle of wondrous function, the refinement of the true primordial qi, the sincerity of non-action, the Dao of lightness and clarity, becoming the guest of feather transformation.\nFlight is like clouds, roaming the world without limit;\nAscension is from below to above, like qi rising into the empty sky, drifting without dispersion.\nUpon reaching this state, the body becomes a companion of the immortals, dwelling on Mount Penglai as a guest of the jade grotto, a visitor to the golden gate, enjoying boundless longevity, donning the six-zhu robe, riding the five-colored clouds, traversing the ten isles.\nOne may drive a dragon chariot or jeweled carriage, wander jade grottoes and golden terraces, where flowers bloom unfading through the four seasons, and the music of immortality plays for myriad days.\nOne may indulge in measured luxury, enjoying boundless wealth and honor.\nHow is this attained?\nThrough human cultivation.\nOne draws near to heaven and distances oneself from hell.\nIf one does not cultivate or practice, lacking Dao and virtue, one will surely draw near to hell and distance oneself from heaven.\nNow, speaking of the affairs of the celestial palace, not even one part in ten thousand has been described.\nBriefly describing the realm of hell, there is a city called Dengduoluo, where King Yama, also known as the Northern Emperor of the Dark Capital, resides, governing the eight grottoes of yin spirits within the eighteen iron cities, where life and death unfold.\nIn the various hells, flames blaze fiercely above, while vast icy cold lies below; to the left stand a thousand rod-bearing mountains, to the right a thousand forests of sword trees—enduring ceaseless suffering. I dare not speak further, lest hearing it pains your heart and disturbs your spirit.\nOnly then will you know that cultivating the Dao is the greatest good, and one may surely ascend and undergo feather transformation to become a celestial immortal.",

      "translated_text": "If one does not cultivate merit and accumulate virtuous deeds, one will sink into hell—when will they ever escape? Today, by fortunate encounter with my transformative teachings, I transmit the scriptures and the Dao, bestow the method and the elixir. With steadfast will and sincere heart, you may surely prolong life.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: On the Method of the True One**\nThe Dao speaks: The method of the True One is the yin of Heaven and Earth, the qi of the myriad things, the nature of humans, the foundation of the Dao, the root of virtue, the ancestor of the body, the origin of life, the essence of the dragon, the form of the tiger, the name of essence, the source of blood, the head of lead, the crown of mercury. When it meets the hun-soul, it becomes three; when it encounters the po-soul, it becomes seven. This is the source of the True One. Though one may know the name of cultivating the True, what is the method of cultivating the True?\nThe master answers: Simply refine the qi of the cinnabar field within the body to strengthen it, and generate the natural spirit in its completeness. Within the twelve hours, guard the primordial qi of Heaven as it enters the palace of the cinnabar field. Let the heart be free of chaotic thoughts, the exterior free of distractions—neither exiting nor entering, neither coming nor going. The spirit settles and finds peace of its own accord. This is the method of the True One.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: On the Method of the Union of the Two Qi**\nThe Dao speaks: The functions of the ascending and descending yin and yang qi of high and low—above, they surge into the vast emptiness; below, they traverse the profound darkness. Wind and water, springs and clouds, mists and fogs—all are the works of the two qi of yin and yang. Even the human body is transformed by yin and yang. Though one may cultivate and refine, it is still the transformation of human yin and yang qi. What, then, is the method of refining my qi?\nListen to this one method: Above the central regulator within the human body belongs to Heaven’s qi, applied to yang; below the central regulator belongs to Earth’s qi, applied to yin. If one guides the upper and lower yin and yang qi to meet and unite in the central palace, one may surely form the sacred embryo. Once the golden elixir is congealed, transformation occurs naturally. One qi can transform into ten, ten into a hundred; one return can transform into a thousand, a second return into ten thousand, a third return into thirty-six thousand spirits in their completeness. Thus, if one does not cultivate, there is no merit; without merit, there is no accomplishment; without accomplishment, there is no completeness—then one cannot ascend as an immortal, and the body will surely perish. But if the heart is resolute, success is achieved; with success, the spirit is complete. How can this not be trusted? If you follow my method, you may surely prolong your years.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: On the Method of the Three Origins, Upper and Lower**\nThe Dao speaks: Heaven, Earth, and Humanity are the origins of the Three Powers. Essence, qi, and spirit are the numinous aspects of the Three Origins, the functions of the upper, middle, and lower palaces. The three cinnabar fields are the means by which the spirit is generated. How may the three fields be filled and the ten thousand spirits made numinous?\nListen to this one method: If the heart is not chaotic, the nature becomes numinous of itself; if thoughts do not move, the spirit becomes complete of itself; if qi is not turbid, the body becomes light of itself; if essence does not scatter, the Dao becomes clear of itself; if merit is not interrupted, one ascends of oneself. I teach you: Treasure the Three Origins, pay homage to the Jade Capital, and with a sincere heart, you may attain longevity.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: Preface on the Method of the Four Proper Responses**\nThe Dao speaks: The Four Proper are the seasons; the sequence is the response to the commands of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Spring governs birth, summer governs growth, autumn governs fruition, and winter governs storage. What is the method of cultivating the Four Proper in humans?\nListen to this one method: In spring, refine the qi of the liver and gallbladder, corresponding to the positions of Jia and Yi Wood. In summer, refine the qi of the heart, corresponding to the positions of Bing and Ding Fire. In autumn, refine the qi of the lungs, corresponding to the positions of Geng and Xin Metal. In winter, refine the qi of the kidneys, corresponding to the positions of Ren and Gui Water. Thus, water and fire face each other, metal and wood unite; the central palace gathers them, and the four phases and five agents all achieve transformation. After one thousand days, the lesser merit is accomplished, and the golden elixir congeals; after two thousand days, the central palace is perfected, and the sacred embryo becomes numinous; after three thousand days, the great merit is complete, and the mortal bones transform. When the bones transform, the earthly name is erased; when the celestial name is inscribed, the body undergoes feather transformation and returns to Penglai. If you cultivate with a sincere heart according to my teachings, how can you not prolong your years and attain longevity?\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: On the Method of the Five Agents Matching the Viscera**\nThe Dao speaks: Heaven, with the yang qi of the five agents, corresponds to the human viscera; Earth, with the yin qi of the five agents, corresponds to the human bowels. Thus, metal, wood, water, fire, and earth transmit to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, corresponding to Bing, Shen, Wu, Geng, and Ren. These correspond to the transformations of yin and yang qi. It is also said that the large intestine, small intestine, stomach, and bladder correspond to Yi, Ding, Ji, Xin, and Gui. Above is the triple burner, below is the Gate of Life—all are the unions of yin and yang. What is the method of their application?\nThe answer: Transmit the qi of the True One into the five viscera to assist their essence and blood, nourish their hun and po souls, and generate spirit and qi—thus prolonging life.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: On the Method of the Six Lines Uniting with the Six Qi**\nThe Dao speaks: The six lines are the three yin and three yang. The first is lesser yang, the second is yang brightness, the third is greater yang. The first is reverting yin, the second is lesser yin, the third is greater yin—these are the six lines uniting with the six qi. What is the function of the six lines?\nThe answer: Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each have ninety days; a year has three hundred and sixty days, with sixty days as one qi, so the six lines complete one cycle. The movement follows the qi’s turning, and the qi follows the movement’s progression. If one comprehends this principle, even within a single day, there are six qi. Yin and Mao are the first qi, corresponding to lesser yang; Chen and Si are the second qi, corresponding to yang brightness; Wu and Wei are the third qi, corresponding to greater yang; Shen and You are the fourth qi, corresponding to reverting yin; Xu and Hai are the fifth qi, corresponding to lesser yin; Zi and Chou are the sixth qi, corresponding to greater yin. It is also said that within the human viscera and bowels, yang moves on the left, and yin moves on the right.",

      "translated_text": "The six divisions of blood and vessels circulate with the qi, completing one cycle each day, traversing the six qi to flow throughout the body. If one can apply this, one may surely prolong life.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: On the Method of the Sevenfold Reversion Elixir**\nThe Dao states: The sevenfold reversion corresponds to the pivot of Heaven and Earth, circulating within the twelve palaces. In the twelve hours of day and night, from the Zi hour to the Wu hour, the intestines revert to yin. As for its application in human cultivation, how is it employed? Simply guide the original true qi from below to revert upward—this is called \"yin reverting to yang.\" Then, return the true original qi from above back downward—this is called \"yang reverting to yin.\" The six yin and six yang converge at the Yellow Court, returning to the Cinnabar Field, where spirit and qi are both fulfilled; thus, it is called the reverted elixir. Heaven descends with yang, Earth ascends with yin, and humans harmonize with qi—all follow this pattern of creation. The *Book of Changes* says: \"After seven days, it returns.\" One must achieve the sevenfold reversion. Therefore, if one reverts the true unified qi in accordance with the times, one may surely prolong life.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Golden Liquor and Reverted Elixir**\nThe Dao states: The method of refining the body with golden liquor is the gateway to cultivation and the root of embryonic breathing since ancient times. It is the pivot of spirit and qi, the ancestral origin of water and fire. To refine form and spirit, first refine the heart. When the heart is open, wisdom arises; when wisdom arises, the method becomes clear; when the method is unified, merit is accomplished; when merit is accomplished, one becomes an immortal, shedding mortal bones to attain transcendence. Without this, how else could it be achieved? If one refines the golden elixir within the dwelling of the body, one may surely prolong life.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: On the Method of Golden Elixir, Embryonic Transformation, and Transcendence**\nThe Dao states: The Golden Elixir is the fulfillment of nine years. Embryonic transformation of the spirit is the process of the mortal becoming sacred. Just as coarse stone nurtures jade within the clam, and the womb nurtures a pearl, mortal flesh nurtures the sacred embryo. Within the false lies the true, within the numinous lies treasure, within the shallow lies depth, and within the noble lies the immortal. One becomes good by drawing near to goodness, evil by drawing near to evil, wise by drawing near to wisdom, and foolish by drawing near to folly. Yet if one neither draws near to wisdom nor folly, the Great Dao surely grants long life.\n\n*The Supreme, Most Wondrous, Mysterious, and Profound Upper Scripture of the Numinous Treasure of the Great Cavern concludes.*",
