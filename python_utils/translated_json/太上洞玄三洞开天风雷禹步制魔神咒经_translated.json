  "full_translation": "The *Supreme Cavern Mystery Scripture of the Three Caverns: Incantation for Commanding Demonic Spirits with the Yu Step, Opening Heaven’s Wind and Thunder*\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Supreme Cavern Mystery Scripture of the Three Caverns: Incantation for Commanding Demonic Spirits with the Yu Step, Sealing Heaven’s Wind and Thunder*\n**Author:** Unknown\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavern Mystery Section, *Benwen* Category\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heavenly Expanse was within the Jade Void Palace of the Kalpa Heavenly Palace, expounding the *Scripture of the Incantation for Commanding Demonic Spirits with the Yu Step, Opening Heaven’s Wind and Thunder* to the hosts of heaven and earth, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the flying heavenly spirit-kings, the great bodhisattvas, and the celestial beings.\n\nThen the Jade Emperor addressed the Great Emperor of Fusang of the Watery Palaces, saying: \"You govern the qi of earth and water below. I observe that within the Watery Palaces dwell many demonic dragons, jiao-serpents, and shen-monsters, wantonly stirring winds and rains, sweeping across the lands and peoples. Tigers, wolves, insects, snakes, and wild beasts—having lived for countless years—transform into spectral beings, refusing to return to the true teaching. Following their base natures, they falsely seek licentious sacrifices, bewildering the people to demand bloody offerings. Some are violent demons or malevolent ghosts, wantonly slaughtering sentient beings. Pity their plight; you must deliver them.\"\n\nThereupon, the Great Emperor of Fusang of the Watery Palaces ascended to address the Heavenly Emperor, saying: \"This humble servant, charged with the governance of the two bureaus, knows not by what method to deliver these sentient beings.\"\n\nThe Supreme Emperor replied: \"In times past, I relinquished the royal throne, forsaking its wealth and honor. For eight hundred kalpas I cultivated the Way, suddenly awakening to the Great Vehicle, and by its fruit attained purity, naturally becoming the Awakened King. The Tathāgata taught the bodhisattvas, and thus I passed through kalpas as numerous as raindrops. By the mandate of the Primordial Beginning, I realized the Jade Void Emperor of the Vast Kalpa Heavenly Palace, presiding over the opening of heaven and the ordering of earth.\n\nAt that time, the sun and moon suffered eclipse, the stars lost their proper courses, each devouring the other, contending over their allotted domains. I summoned the Eight Thunder Gods of Heaven to subdue the myriad stars. Through my numinous power I refined them, restraining the demonic kings and stellar spirits, their divine transformations beyond measure. I could command a single thunder god to lift Mount Tai in hand and transport it elsewhere. I could command a single thunder god to swallow the waters of the Four Great Seas, leaving not a single drop. I could command a single thunder god to leap a hundred and eight yojanas into the sky, devouring the sun and moon and consuming the stellar spirits. I could command a single thunder god to spew fierce fire throughout the worlds, burning away the demonic and returning all to the true Dao. Thus, the sun, moon, and stars were restored to their proper places, each guarding its domain, the stars shining brightly, and day and night were first distinguished.\n\nNow, I entrust to you the scriptural threads of the Three Caverns. You may transmit them in the mortal world to those who cultivate the Way. All thunder gods, in accordance with their precious registers, shall heed the talismanic commands, swiftly manifesting in secret to demonstrate their power—shaking heaven and earth, displaying the efficacy of slaying demons and vanquishing specters. Those who receive and uphold these scriptural threads must constantly recite this incantation, augmenting the majestic radiance of the thunder gods, bestowing it upon them to align with the true Dao and accord with this mind.\"\n\nThereupon, the Jade Emperor proclaimed the *Incantation for Opening Heaven and Restraining Demons*:\n\n*\"The Five Thunders’ mighty spirits,\nBorn with the Emperor’s same essence.\nReceiving the Jade Emperor’s charge,\nThey subdue the host of stars.\nFierce officials in ten thousand ranks,\nYakṣas in a thousand legions.\nSeven heads and a hundred arms,\nVast mouths and golden essence.\nBodies ten thousand leagues in height,\nDevouring demonic spirits.\nWhere they walk, wind and rain arise;\nWhere they sit, thunder resounds.\nThe Thunder Duke’s thunderclap,\nThe Lightning Mother’s true numen.\nWind and thunder roar and blare,\nHeaven and earth stand in awe.\nSlaying dragons, beheading specters,\nDay and night without cease.\nA thousand gods bow in submission,\nTen thousand spirits all obey.\nThe Five Peaks and Five Emperors,\nThe Four Waterways’ Source Lords.\nThe Yangzi, Yellow, Huai, and Ji,\nThe Twelve Streams’ true spirits.\nBeneath the Nine Earths,\nIn the springs’ curves and dark depths.\nThe Northern Capital of Fengdu,\nThe Abyssal Caverns of the Vast Deep.\nAbove the Nine Heavens,\nThe sun, moon, and stars.\nThe flying heavenly spirit-kings,\nEach and all heed the command.\nThe earthly bureaus and watery palaces,\nWhere ghostly encampments are known.\nEver executing the true mandate,\nNurturing and fostering all beings.\nShould any dare transgress,\nThe talismanic command shall summon them.\nThunder and lightning, obeying the decree,\nShall execute, slay, burn, and incinerate.\nTheir might is irresistible,\nTheir punishment inescapable.\nArrayed in the Nine Heavens,\nThe Jade Emperor chants the hymn.\nDivine power blazes forth,\nWrathful and majestic.\nBeheading demons, slaying specters,\nThunder, lightning, and stars fly.\nBala’s might shakes,\nDali’s radiance blazes.\nRevealed through Chen Ji,\nBeholding the scarlet robes.\nThe drum’s subtle flow,\nNanlu casts his garment.\nEntrusted to Yan Shi,\nNight’s might in the Dipper’s midst.\nXu Ying, the Great King,\nAnu speaks above.\nThe drum’s thousand harmonies,\nChenzhu’s wrathful halt.\nShu Fu’s bright longevity,\nKui’s distant retreat.\nThe hymn’s true ease,\nThunder’s hidden subtlety.\nRecite it ten thousand times,\nIn accord with the spirits.\nRadiant as sun and moon,\nMajestic power fully arrayed.\nOn ren, gui, hai, and zi days,\nConstantly recite this scripture.\nDivine spirits lend their aid,\nUniting with the Dao in truth.\nThe Supreme Emperor’s divine incantation—\nDo not transmit it to the unworthy.\nTo lightly disclose or profane it\nBrings calamity upon descendants.\nRecite it with utmost sincerity,\nAnd command thunder and lightning.\nAbove, ascend to the imperial court;\nBelow, deliver the dark depths.\nShould you follow my teaching,\nThe heavens shall chant your name.\nThunder and lightning shall guard and protect you,\nAnd you shall be called a True Person.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with\nThe Jade Emperor’s statutes and decrees!\"*\n\nThereupon, the Great Emperor of Fusang of the Watery Palaces, together with the hosts of heaven and earth, the sun, moon, and stars, the flying heavenly spirit-kings, the great bodhisattvas, and the celestial beings, all rejoiced greatly, faithfully receiving and practicing the teaching.\n\nThen the Great Emperor of Fusang made this vow: \"Your servant shall widely transmit and propagate this teaching among those who deliver the world below.\"\n\nAt that time, the Jade Emperor further addressed the Great Emperor of Fusang, saying: \"Without these scriptures and registers, the people of the mortal world cannot restrain demonic forces or command thunder and lightning. You must widely transmit and confer them in the world, but do not reveal them to the unworthy, that they may deliver the people of heaven.\"\n\n\"I shall dispatch the Three Officials to record with brush and ink, examining merits and transgressions with flawless precision. Those of merit shall receive heavenly talismans, summoned to the Golden Palace. According to the depth and weight of their merit, they shall ascend to the ranks of immortals.\"\n\nThereupon, the Great Emperor of Fusang presented the sacred decree, bowing in gratitude for the heavenly grace, and took his leave to depart.\n\nThus concludes the *Sutra of the Three Caverns’ Numinous Writs for Opening Heaven, Commanding Wind and Thunder, and the Yu Pace to Restrain Demonic Spirits*.",
