  "full_translation": "**\"The Dao-Chan Collection**\n*Title:* **The Dao-Chan Collection**\n*Compiled by:* **Master Wang Zhenren of the Jin-Yuan Era**\n*Volume:* **One**\n*Source:* **From the *Zhengtong Daozang*, Taixuan Section**\n\n**The Dao-Chan Collection**\n*By Master Wang Zhenren of Jinpo*\n\nOn occasion, companions repeatedly inquired about Chan practice, and their earnest, unyielding pursuit filled me with delight. Yet, reflecting on my own limited talent and dull wit, my feeble words and shallow expressions brought shame upon the monastic assembly. Unworthy of such virtue and discipline, I found myself lost in dreams within dreams—stacking heads upon heads.\n\nWithin the plum-bamboo grove, thorny flowers bloom;\nAmidst the lion’s den, foxes howl in defiance.\nYet without sudden awakening, this remains but a fleeting thought—\nNo turning of the body to grasp even half the truth.\n\nIf one does not pluck some tendrils of the vine,\nThe lock’s key will never turn.\nFirst, rely on **one essence**—\nIts clarity breaks through all bonds.\nNext, acknowledge **the four inversions**—\nEmploy them to perfect the whole.\n\nForgotten name, abandoned form—\nExtinguish the false, reveal the true.\nAvoid the paths of the Three Vehicles,\nShatter the gates of all marvels.\nWithin speech, the echo responds;\nWithin phrases, the mechanism unfolds.\n\nA formless wisdom-sword—\nWielded at will, it cuts through all appearances.\nA pearl beyond form—\nGiven freely to all who seek.\n\nPhrases like autumn moon sifting jade,\nWords like spring flowers weaving silk.\nUltimately, pointing to the moon—\nOnce the moon is seen, the finger has no use.\nSeeking fish requires a net—\nOnce the fish is caught, what need remains for the net?\n\nThus, when the painted screen is shattered,\nThe worldly household’s wind is known.\nWhen the barrel’s bottom is shed,\nNo trace of life’s calculations remains.\n\nAdd a hair’s breadth—\nLike a thorn in the eye.\nSubtract a hair’s breadth—\nLike a wound carved into flesh.\n\nWithout one of keen insight,\nThis truth remains unshared.\n\nNow, failing to recognize one’s own eyebrows,\nYet tearing apart another’s face—\nThis teaches: seeing and hearing must be direct,\nLest one grope blindly through heaven and earth.\n\nThose who penetrate it may set it aside;\nThose of wisdom may adapt it freely.\n\nThus, it mends the chaos of **Hun Dun**—\nSeven orifices harmonized in unity.\nIt strikes the void—\nThe six directions crumble to dust.\n\nThough lacking in startling techniques,\nIt holds **qi-circulation** and **sharp wit**—\nThis understanding is like gazing at the sky through mist;\nThis fluidity is like seeing the sun through parted clouds.\n\nWhy traverse ten thousand rivers and mountains,\nWhen the Ten Isles and Three Realms lie at hand?\nSeek no virtuous cause beneath the straw sandals,\nNor question the heart’s essence upon the meditation cushion.\n\nThe eight characters before you—open them.\nThe two hands below—receive them.\n\nThose with eyes must bear the burden;\nThose without strength must exert it.\n\n**Following is a verse for all to verify:**\n\n*Preface to the Verse:*\n\nThe iron wealth and copper voice—\nQi and resolve unyielding,\nLip-swords and tongue-lances like spears.\nYet come near, and heads fall—\nHeads not fallen still bear wounds.\n\nAsk: who bears the wounds?\nWho loses the head?\nHeadless, ears and eyes intact—\nWounded, blind and deaf as stone.\n\nThe void resounds with drumbeats—\nWho is guest, who host?\n\n**Seventy-fourth Verse:**\nNaturally, guest and host suffer no loss,\nMotion and stillness both forgotten—\nThe Dao’s true nature is still sickness;\nHow bear to speak of subtler mysteries?\n\nWhen mysteries are shattered—how then?\nFace-to-face, the truth is plain.\n\nPluck forth the white egret from the void—\nNo need to speak of surpassing New La.\n\nDaily life’s plainness, naturally attained—\nNo law can be passed on.\n\nNo need for fists or idle faith;\nMoonlight and wind say all of Zen.\n\nTwo hundred realms in the eye’s dust—\nMountains, rivers, earth—all gathered in a mote.\n\nSeek not the Ten Directions, Three Realms—\nAll lies within the gilded staff’s tip.\n\nTraverse the world yet the body stirs not—\nEach thing shattered, roundly perfected.\n\nWhy speak of *Changchun*’s scene?\nWhite daylight, clear wind, bright moon.\n\nAwakened, the whole body is eyes;\nLost, sighted yet blind as night.\n\nThe world asks: how many bear the plank?\nDo not doubt—daylight shines night and day.\n\nIron men bear the plank—soundless;\nStone maidens blow the *sheng*—lips unmoved.\nRotten wood laughs in winter’s thaw,\nCold cliffs bloom with strange spring.\n\nWide learning, much knowing—Zen unmet,\nFoolish cats guard dens in vain.\n\nPitiful, wise men of past and present—\nEyed yet how fail to see the sky?\n\nAll bear the White Guan Yin—\nRoundly responsive, seek not beyond.\nEars, eyes, tongue, voice all grasp the marvel—\nSeeing, hearing, knowing—one mind.\n\nZen’s path has never been easy—\nClarity reveals the thorn’s true nature.\n\nHow bear the inner void’s true display?\nLike clouds parted, the sun revealed.\n\nRound perfection, light equal to emptiness—\nNot a hair’s breadth wasted in an instant’s work.\n\nIf the crown’s true eye is complete,\nThe eight extremes merge as one.\n\nThe void as drum, I as mallet—\nStrike clear: what doubt remains?\n\nTurn aside the Dao’s idle pair—\nSaint and commoner both unharmed.\n\nOne phrase strikes true—ancestral wind—\nFrom first, water leaks not through.\n\nSometimes tiger roars, dragon sings—\nLeaping from the spirit mountain’s sea.\n\nLuminous, the body’s marvel—\nFilling the void, never enough.\n\nAsk: where lies its true core?\nGreen willows sway as ever.\n\nIron flute, no holes—wooden man blows,\nOne resonant note shakes the earth’s might.\nAwakens the thousand-handed compassion—\nDivine power reveals the full truth.\n\nEverywhere, the void—one sky—\nWhy seek afar the profound?\n\nWithin the body, Buddhas and Immortals dwell—\nTen Directions revealed before the eyes.\n\nDo not puzzle Zen’s truth as riddle—\nEmpty heart, transparent as the Thus-Come One.\n\nWithin, chew through the poem’s taste—\nGrass, wood, mountains, rivers—eyes open wide.\n\nFrom the beginning of the eon, unchanged—\nPeach blossoms, last year’s red, this year’s glow.\n\nWho knows the hundred grasses’ intent?\nThe original master lingers at the tips.\n\nOne spark of spirit mixes the Nine Heavens—\nEncounter green, and Penglai’s eyes turn.\n\nBefore spring, willow fluff dances with wind,\nAfter winter, plum blooms with snow.\n\nClapping hands, stroking beard—one laugh—\nAwakened, all things accord with truth.\n\nHeaven’s spring color knows no height—\nNarrow earth’s branches, long or short.\n\nAmong wolves and tigers, stand firm—\nSlaves and maids distinguish kin from stranger.\n\nEvery home may pierce the Chang’an road—\nHow few reach Chang’an’s gate.\n\nThe white ox dwells in white clouds,\nFormless, striding the morning wind.\n\nLeisurely till the elixir fields of sun and moon,\nNurturing the spirit’s seeds—no labor needed.\n\nThe Daoist walks unstained by dust,\nOnly fearing true awakening’s delay.\n\nEver chasing fragrant grass paths,\nUnknowing of forsaking home’s spring.\n\nA thought of nonbirth grasps true nature—\nBo’s vines entangle like calamity.\n\nSudden shatter of the mystic gate’s lock—\nMoonlight and wind, the free.\n\nOne spark of spirit mixes the Great Void—\nParamount Zen wastes no effort.\n\nPlain body, plain Dao—\nPlain Dao, yet none.\n\nGazing at True Suchness—still deluded,\nSeeing, hearing, knowing—fourfold error.\n\nRecognizing the heart, bearing the original—\nStill falls to the Dao’s second stage.\n\nSeated, the Ten Directions are one home—\nCold cliffs, dead wood—new shoots sprout.\n\nIf one attains *Changchun*’s scene,\nIron trees bloom with clear flowers.\n\nMidst June’s scorching heat—how endure?\nBeneath rootless trees, frost clings to leaves.\n\nOne ember in the red furnace—cold snow—\nIntent pure, taste ever long.\n\nSudden chill in the western wind—\nHedge’s golden chrysanthemums whisper scent.\n\nAutumn’s light does not deceive the old—\nStill, late-blooming yellow flowers perfume.\n\nTo grasp Zen, each phrase must pass—\nSouth becomes north, east calls west.\n\nAncient cases all severed—\nPiercing the Thus-Come One’s marvelous void.\n\nTouching all, yet who reveals?\nDwelling, walking, sitting—tightly bound.\n\nRound enlightenment, all possess—\nRotten bones like mountains, unaware.\n\nAsk: has one seen the two mud oxen?\nFighting in the boundless ocean’s depths.\nNostrils sever the sky’s message—\nOne loss, no-form moon at autumn’s height.\n\nEye-disease chases fleeting flowers—\nOne moves, ten thousand waves follow.\nDisease gone, flowers faded—Zen struggles free,\nMoonlight and wind, unknowing.\n\nRaw iron brought to the kitchen’s forge,\nCast as sour fillings and fine pastries.\nIf one chews through its taste,\nThey stumble into impermanence’s embrace.\n\nWestward, ten thousand eight thousand leagues—\nTo sit still is to walk.\n\nPoetry calls back the plank-bearer—\nOpen the rear’s eye, clear as day.\n\nThe Great Sage reveals: one word holds many meanings,\nWho taught you to chant *Amituo*?\n\nEntering the gate, three thousand blows are struck—\nSwiftly ask the elder brother: does he feel the pain?\n\nLet all entanglements rest, no need to probe,\nDo not ask of the three before or three behind.\n\nOnly attain the purity of your native land’s breeze,\nFar mountains still lock in misty peaks.\n\nWhite oxen graze on dew-lit earth—hold them not,\nFeast on hunger, drink on thirst, weary in spring and autumn.\n\nThe wooden man does not grasp the sealed tongue,\nSpeaking to green hills, which nod in silence.\n\nAmidst the myriad forms, only one body stands revealed—\nNow anger, now joy, now distant, now close.\n\nHow can you bear to hear, see, and know?\nAll are but kin within your own house.\n\nTo know the parents before they were born,\nOnly in the human form, not in the heavens.\n\nA hundred clashing thoughts shatter the skull,\nWould you dare neglect the Master’s Zen?\n\nFrog’s cave in autumn frost, clam’s womb in gestation,\nPearls do not come from such depths.\n\nSaints and mortals blend in the red dust,\nA single golden lotus blooms in fire’s embrace.\n\nHow is this your family now?\nBefore your eyes, the sand of ignorance is cleared.\n\nStill, men commend the green lotus,\nSpring crows chirp, cursing fallen flowers.\n\nBinding the West, South, North as Daoist talk,\nWithin the six directions lies but one hermitage.\n\nFrom this point, no dwelling in the realm of mortals and saints,\nFar mountains remain blue as the sky.\n\nNo excess, no deficiency—wondrously complete,\nIn taking and discarding, it is unbearable.\n\nTo carve out flesh-wounds still endures,\nBut piercing the eye’s blade is hard to taste.\n\nYesterday’s strike shattered the *Taixu* void,\nRecognizing the ancient master from the start.\n\nYet you turn and gather the empty space,\nStill leaving it lost in boundless obscurity.\n\nDo not blame the wild and reckless for their lack,\nThey dare to split the nature of ignorance and mortals.\n\nIf you summon the nameless master,\nWho dares to sever and trim the empty space?\n\nThe empty space is plucked with cause,\nSeek the ancient master from before.\n\nNow that you know the empty space,\nYou see the true form is whole and real.\n\nDaoists meet—one moment of clarity,\nBefore your eyes, beneath your brows—what more to guess?\n\nMen can savor the waters of the Western River,\nRiding mud-dragons to emerge from the sea.\n\nUnderstanding the pure and empty Zen,\nWhen hungry, eat; when weary, sleep.\n\nTo know the true upward path,\nPoint to the high pine on the cloud’s edge.\n\nWhich school shares the Way with Daoists?\nIts wonder lies in human transformation.\n\nAutumn moon, spring flowers, winter snow and hail—\nAll are the master’s own.\n\nAsk: do you not know the world’s path?\nEars perceive objects, eyes see as brows.\n\nThe spring in the kettle never changes,\nOutside things hold their own winds and lights.\n\nTen thousand leagues of river and sky, one hue in autumn,\nThree peaks, four seas—scenes pure and profound.\n\nIf you press down the divine dragon’s head,\nIt will not drift with waves and tides.\n\nI reveal the rare mysteries of the void,\nYet you bind yourself, creating endless doubt.\n\nWhen enlightenment dawns, the sun opens your eyes,\nIn confusion, wind ruffles the water’s brow.\n\nA single spark of *lingqi* shines like the Emperor’s,\nFrom ancient times, no saints could proclaim it.\n\nYet you teach the world beyond the forms,\nGushing streams and pine winds speak Zen.\n\nNeedle’s tip and sesame’s hole are not narrow,\nSea’s edge and heaven’s farthest are not wide.\n\nBoundless clarity fills your formless eyes,\nBrightly seen, no deceit from others.\n\nPity those who chase illusions in empty flowers,\nTurning their backs on my gate to seek another’s.\n\nThey say there is no original matter,\nYet the *Miaoxuan* still seems like sand in the eye.\n\nBefore the hall, emerald bamboo rises smoke-free,\nOutside the willow, oriole’s song slides like a string.\n\nWith eyes, Zen is still commended—\nNo need to speak of *Laopo Zen*.\n\nSeeing colors, hearing sounds—true nature revealed,\nHead by head, the Dharma King’s body shines.\n\nWho recognizes the flowers in full bloom?\nThey are the sacred seeds that forget spring.\n\nBoundless Zen-heart measures emptiness equally,\nNo need for words to exhaust all scriptures.\n\nWithin this, the ancient commendation stands,\nTrustworthy on brow and in eye.\n\nSeeing things and knowing the mind reveals the mind,\nKnowing the mind turns the great earth to gold.\n\nWithin your body lies a bright pearl,\nDo not seek it beneath the dragon’s jaw.\n\nSometimes you hold fast but let no wind pass,\nWasting the teacher’s efforts, misusing your practice.\n\nOverthrow the golden-haired, aged one,\nThe hare teaches men to call the master.\n\nTreading the world’s edge, your feet do not move,\nWhere feet do not move, the Dao’s subtleties are grasped.\n\nDo you not hear the monkeys’ cries or sparrows’ chatter?\nAll speak of the upward path of the *zongcheng*.\n\nThree bodies, four knowings—yet no head,\nEight solutions, six penetrations—wondrously complete.\n\nFace and form were originally perfect,\nNo need for rouge—still elegant and free.\n\nAsking of the Way, Zen—hard to behold,\nLike waves rising on flat ground.\n\nConfusion’s clouds scatter, revealing true emptiness,\nTen thousand leagues of river and sky—one chill hue.\n\nMen come to ask of my ancestral Buddha’s school,\nPointing directly to the first peak of the sacred mountain.\n\nWith hands, it is hard to search,\nYet without the mind, the ancient face appears.\n\n*Jaya* raises his fist as if to greet you,\n*Ananda* folds his palms—what doubt remains?\n\nCarved jade has no shadow, twin pine trees stand,\nFlowers laugh, binding winds—the first branch.\n\nI possess an elixir beyond the world,\nNo need to forge—simply take as is.\n\nUnseal the musk of the mind,\nPierce the nose’s scent of Zen’s harmony.\n\nMind and realm both forgotten, ten thousand realms shine,\nBare roots beneath the tree—leaves frozen in stillness.\n\nThe wooden man is about to leave his boots behind,\nThe stone maiden invites conversation on brief and long.\n\nOverturning the *Xuanxuan*, no true foundation stands,\nDao and Zen are seen through—dust in the eye.\n\nLaughing rocks and withered trees,\nA separate Penglai grotto blooms with spring.\n\nRaise your fist—do you understand?\nBow your head, and terns fly past New罗.\n\nDo not speak of my family’s wind to the confused,\nWords unmatched—one sentence too many.\n\nOriginal face equals emptiness—same in measure,\nYet hard to speak of—who is the one?\n\nThe round form needs no moon for comparison,\nWisdom’s light shines, leaving no lack.\n\nWhat need for boasting after great enlightenment?\nDao and Zen are seen through—sand in the eye.\n\nPiercingly bright, illuminating the true void,\nEight extremes observed—all as one.\n\nYet true emptiness is not in words,\nMy clumsy verses express its spirit.\n\nThe Great Void though without form,\nEach pinch reveals its freshness anew—\nDao and Zen, both exhausted in unity.",

marvel—\nFilling the void, never enough.\n\nAsk: where lies its true core?\nGreen willows sway as ever.\n\nIron flute, no holes—wooden man blows,\nOne resonant note shakes the earth’s might.\nAwakens the thousand-handed compassion—\nDivine power reveals the full truth.\n\nEverywhere, the void—one sky—\nWhy seek afar the profound?\n\nWithin the body, Buddhas and Immortals dwell—\nTen Directions revealed before the eyes.\n\nDo not puzzle Zen’s truth as riddle—\nEmpty heart, transparent as the Thus-Come One.\n\nWithin, chew through the poem’s taste—\nGrass, wood, mountains, rivers—eyes open wide.\n\nFrom the beginning of the eon, unchanged—\nPeach blossoms, last year’s red, this year’s glow.\n\nWho knows the hundred grasses’ intent?\nThe original master lingers at the tips.\n\nOne spark of spirit mixes the Nine Heavens—\nEncounter green, and Penglai’s eyes turn.\n\nBefore spring, willow fluff dances with wind,\nAfter winter, plum blooms with snow.\n\nClapping hands, stroking beard—one laugh—\nAwakened, all things accord with truth.\n\nHeaven’s spring color knows no height—\nNarrow earth’s branches, long or short.\n\nAmong wolves and tigers, stand firm—\nSlaves and maids distinguish kin from stranger.\n\nEvery home may pierce the Chang’an road—\nHow few reach Chang’an’s gate.\n\nThe white ox dwells in white clouds,\nFormless, striding the morning wind.\n\nLeisurely till the elixir fields of sun and moon,\nNurturing the spirit’s seeds—no labor needed.\n\nThe Daoist walks unstained by dust,\nOnly fearing true awakening’s delay.\n\nEver chasing fragrant grass paths,\nUnknowing of forsaking home’s spring.\n\nA thought of nonbirth grasps true nature—\nBo’s vines entangle like calamity.\n\nSudden shatter of the mystic gate’s lock—\nMoonlight and wind, the free.\n\nOne spark of spirit mixes the Great Void—\nParamount Zen wastes no effort.\n\nPlain body, plain Dao—\nPlain Dao, yet none.\n\nGazing at True Suchness—still deluded,\nSeeing, hearing, knowing—fourfold error.\n\nRecognizing the heart, bearing the original—\nStill falls to the Dao’s second stage.\n\nSeated, the Ten Directions are one home—\nCold cliffs, dead wood—new shoots sprout.\n\nIf one attains *Changchun*’s scene,\nIron trees bloom with clear flowers.\n\nMidst June’s scorching heat—how endure?\nBeneath rootless trees, frost clings to leaves.\n\nOne ember in the red furnace—cold snow—\nIntent pure, taste ever long.\n\nSudden chill in the western wind—\nHedge’s golden chrysanthemums whisper scent.\n\nAutumn’s light does not deceive the old—\nStill, late-blooming yellow flowers perfume.\n\nTo grasp Zen, each phrase must pass—\nSouth becomes north, east calls west.\n\nAncient cases all severed—\nPiercing the Thus-Come One’s marvelous void.\n\nTouching all, yet who reveals?\nDwelling, walking, sitting—tightly bound.\n\nRound enlightenment, all possess—\nRotten bones like mountains, unaware.\n\nAsk: has one seen the two mud oxen?\nFighting in the boundless ocean’s depths.\nNostrils sever the sky’s message—\nOne loss, no-form moon at autumn’s height.\n\nEye-disease chases fleeting flowers—\nOne moves, ten thousand waves follow.\nDisease gone, flowers faded—Zen struggles free,\nMoonlight and wind, unknowing.\n\nRaw iron brought to the kitchen’s forge,\nCast as sour fillings and fine pastries.\nIf one chews through its taste,\nThey stumble into impermanence’s embrace.\n\nWestward, ten thousand eight thousand leagues—\nTo sit still is to walk.\n\nPoetry calls back the plank-bearer—\nOpen the rear’s eye, clear as day.",

when weary, sleep.\n\nTo know the true upward path,\nPoint to the high pine on the cloud’s edge.\n\nWhich school shares the Way with Daoists?\nIts wonder lies in human transformation.\n\nAutumn moon, spring flowers, winter snow and hail—\nAll are the master’s own.\n\nAsk: do you not know the world’s path?\nEars perceive objects, eyes see as brows.\n\nThe spring in the kettle never changes,\nOutside things hold their own winds and lights.\n\nTen thousand leagues of river and sky, one hue in autumn,\nThree peaks, four seas—scenes pure and profound.\n\nIf you press down the divine dragon’s head,\nIt will not drift with waves and tides.\n\nI reveal the rare mysteries of the void,\nYet you bind yourself, creating endless doubt.\n\nWhen enlightenment dawns, the sun opens your eyes,\nIn confusion, wind ruffles the water’s brow.\n\nA single spark of *lingqi* shines like the Emperor’s,\nFrom ancient times, no saints could proclaim it.\n\nYet you teach the world beyond the forms,\nGushing streams and pine winds speak Zen.\n\nNeedle’s tip and sesame’s hole are not narrow,\nSea’s edge and heaven’s farthest are not wide.\n\nBoundless clarity fills your formless eyes,\nBrightly seen, no deceit from others.\n\nPity those who chase illusions in empty flowers,\nTurning their backs on my gate to seek another’s.\n\nThey say there is no original matter,\nYet the *Miaoxuan* still seems like sand in the eye.\n\nBefore the hall, emerald bamboo rises smoke-free,\nOutside the willow, oriole’s song slides like a string.\n\nWith eyes, Zen is still commended—\nNo need to speak of *Laopo Zen*.\n\nSeeing colors, hearing sounds—true nature revealed,\nHead by head, the Dharma King’s body shines.\n\nWho recognizes the flowers in full bloom?\nThey are the sacred seeds that forget spring.\n\nBoundless Zen-heart measures emptiness equally,\nNo need for words to exhaust all scriptures.\n\nWithin this, the ancient commendation stands,\nTrustworthy on brow and in eye.\n\nSeeing things and knowing the mind reveals the mind,\nKnowing the mind turns the great earth to gold.\n\nWithin your body lies a bright pearl,\nDo not seek it beneath the dragon’s jaw.\n\nSometimes you hold fast but let no wind pass,\nWasting the teacher’s efforts, misusing your practice.\n\nOverthrow the golden-haired, aged one,\nThe hare teaches men to call the master.\n\nTreading the world’s edge, your feet do not move,\nWhere feet do not move, the Dao’s subtleties are grasped.\n\nDo you not hear the monkeys’ cries or sparrows’ chatter?\nAll speak of the upward path of the *zongcheng*.\n\nThree bodies, four knowings—yet no head,\nEight solutions, six penetrations—wondrously complete.\n\nFace and form were originally perfect,\nNo need for rouge—still elegant and free.\n\nAsking of the Way, Zen—hard to behold,\nLike waves rising on flat ground.\n\nConfusion’s clouds scatter, revealing true emptiness,\nTen thousand leagues of river and sky—one chill hue.\n\nMen come to ask of my ancestral Buddha’s school,\nPointing directly to the first peak of the sacred mountain.\n\nWith hands, it is hard to search,\nYet without the mind, the ancient face appears.\n\n*Jaya* raises his fist as if to greet you,\n*Ananda* folds his palms—what doubt remains?\n\nCarved jade has no shadow, twin pine trees stand,\nFlowers laugh, binding winds—the first branch.\n\nI possess an elixir beyond the world,\nNo need to forge—simply take as is.\n\nUnseal the musk of the mind,\nPierce the nose’s scent of Zen’s harmony.\n\nMind and realm both forgotten, ten thousand realms shine,\nBare roots beneath the tree—leaves frozen in stillness.\n\nThe wooden man is about to leave his boots behind,\nThe stone maiden invites conversation on brief and long.\n\nOverturning the *Xuanxuan*, no true foundation stands,\nDao and Zen are seen through—dust in the eye.\n\nLaughing rocks and withered trees,\nA separate Penglai grotto blooms with spring.\n\nRaise your fist—do you understand?\nBow your head, and terns fly past New罗.\n\nDo not speak of my family’s wind to the confused,\nWords unmatched—one sentence too many.\n\nOriginal face equals emptiness—same in measure,\nYet hard to speak of—who is the one?\n\nThe round form needs no moon for comparison,\nWisdom’s light shines, leaving no lack.\n\nWhat need for boasting after great enlightenment?\nDao and Zen are seen through—sand in the eye.\n\nPiercingly bright, illuminating the true void,\nEight extremes observed—all as one.\n\nYet true emptiness is not in words,\nMy clumsy verses express its spirit.",
