  "full_translation": "**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries**\n**Section: Masters (Subcategory 14) – Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue**\n**Daoist School – Abstract**\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note:\n\n*Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue* (*Daode baozhang*), in one fascicle, was composed by Ge Changgeng of the Song dynasty. Changgeng, styled Baisou, was a native of Minqing in Fujian and a Daoist priest residing on Mount Wuyi. The original edition bore the title *Purple Clarity Perfected One Bai Yuchan*, for \"Bai Yuchan\" was his sobriquet, and \"Purple Clarity Perfected One\" the title conferred upon him when summoned to the imperial court during the Jiading era. His commentary follows the text with annotations, eschewing philological exegesis of characters or phrases, nor does it extensively elaborate. His glosses are often sparser than the original scripture’s passages, and their purport frequently resembles Chan gāthās—no doubt because Buddhism and Daoism share a common source.\n\nThis edition was hand-copied and engraved by Zhao Mengfu of the Yuan dynasty, its calligraphy and carving executed with exquisite precision. Chen Jiru of the Ming later reprinted it in his *Compendium of Secret Writings*, retitling it *Toad Immortal’s Explication of the Laozi*, though this diverges from the original title. Additionally, two postscripts by the Recluse of Shiyuan Residence, dated the *guiwei* year of the Wanli reign, precede the text. The first postscript cites *Dong You’s Catalogue of Collected Books*, which records Zhang Daoxiang’s *Anthology of Ancient and Modern Commentaries on the Laozi*, comprising over forty schools—yet omits this work. Now, Zhang Daoxiang was a man of the Tianbao era of the Tang; how could he have included a book from the Ningzong period of the Southern Song in his catalogue? Moreover, Zhang’s anthology lists twenty-nine schools, plus his own commentary, totaling thirty—not \"over forty.\" The postscript’s claims appear to be hearsay.\n\nChanggeng is traditionally regarded as an immortal. Liu Kezhuang’s collected works include a preface to *Wang Yu’s Six Studies and Nine Books*, wherein he recounts meeting four alchemists: Zou Ziyi, who did not reach seventy; Zeng Jingjian and Huang Tiangu, who barely reached sixty; and Bai Yuchan, who died young. Furthermore, Chen Zhensun’s *Book Catalogue with Abstracts* states under *Collected Pearls and Jade of the Immortals*: \"Bai Yuchan, surnamed Ge, was a native of Minqing in Fuzhou. He once committed a crime and fled into exile—truly a reckless and deceitful rogue.\" While serving as magistrate of Nancheng, I encountered a sojourning scholar who inquired whether I had ever met this man. I replied, \"How could such a person be permitted to cross my threshold?\" Both accounts, contemporaneous with Changgeng, suggest that popular legends likely arose from later embellishments. However, Daoists naturally exalt their own tradition, and such tendencies are common. Since his book contains much of value, there is little need to scrutinize the man too closely.\n\nRespectfully submitted for imperial review in the tenth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.\n\n**Chief Compilers:**\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collators:**\nMinister Lu Feichi\n\n**Imperially Commissioned Four Treasuries**\n*Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue*\nBy Song [Dynasty] Ge Changgeng\n\n**Embodying the Dao**\nThe Dao—\n[It is thus and no more.]\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\n[To speak of it is already not so.]\nThe Name—\n[Forced designation as \"Dao\"]\nThe Name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\n[To call it Dao is already not so.]\n\nThe Non-being—\n[This is the Dao.]\nIt is called the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Being—\n[The One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, the Three generates the myriad things—thus Being arises.]\nIt is called the mother of the myriad things.\n[The One gives birth to the myriad existences; the myriad existences return to the One.]\n\nThus, abide in constant Non-being\n[Empty the mind, extinguish thoughts]\nto observe its mysteries.\nAbide in constant Being\n[Preserve the center, embrace the One]\nto observe its manifestations.\n\nThese two\n[The myriad existences and Non-being; Non-being itself is also Non-being, yet within Non-being, Non-being does not exist]\nemerge together yet bear different names.\n[The myriad dharmas return to the One; the One mind is fundamentally empty.]\nTogether they are called the Profound.\n[The Dao does not seek emptiness; emptiness naturally returns to it. When one can empty the mind, the Dao naturally returns to them.]\nProfound beyond profound—\n[Within emptiness, the True is concealed; from Non-being, Being arises.]\nthe gateway to all mysteries.\n[Awakening enters here; its application is inexhaustible.]\n\n**Nurturing Life**\nWhen all under Heaven know the beautiful as\n[Seeking to be called beautiful]\nbeautiful, ugliness arises.\n[Failing to attain the name of beauty.]\nWhen all know the good as\n[Seeking to be called good]\ngood, not-good arises.\n[Instead becoming evil.]\n\nThus, Being and Non-being give rise to one another;\nDifficulty and ease complete one another;\nLong and short shape one another;\n[The Dao is originally formless; lengths define themselves in contrast.]\nHigh and low incline toward one another;\n[Tian revolves, Earth turns—originally without hierarchy.]\nSound and voice harmonize with one another;\n[One wind stirs, the myriad pipes respond.]\nBefore and after follow one another.\n[The ancient is the present; the present will be the ancient.]\n\nTherefore, the sage abides in non-action\n[Valuing naturalness]\nand practices the teaching without words.\n[The Dao is embodied in things.]\nThe myriad things arise yet are not rejected;\n[Non-being must give rise to Being—how could it not? If it did not, how could permanence be perceived?]\nThey are born yet not possessed;\n[Nothing is not illusory and transient.]\nThey act yet do not rely on it;\n[Today, today—nothing more.]\nTheir work is accomplished yet not dwelt upon.\n[How can dreams be taken as reality?]\nOnly because they do not dwell\n[Forgetting the external yet not forgetting the internal]\ndo they not depart.\n[The one self remains.]\n\n**Pacifying the People**\nDo not exalt worthiness—\n[As a son, one should be filial; as a subject, loyal.]\nso the people do not contend.\nDo not prize rare goods—\n[Gold and earth share the same value.]\nso the people do not steal.\nDo not display what is desirable—\n[Between the ears and eyes, the mind truly resides.]\nso the heart is not disordered.\n[When it strays, call it back.]\n\nThus, the sage’s governance:\nEmpty their minds,\nFill their bellies,\nWeaken their ambitions,\nStrengthen their bones,\nAlways keep the people without knowledge and without desire.\nLet those with knowledge\nnot dare to act.\nAct through non-action—\nthen nothing will be ungoverned.\n\n**The Fathomless Source**\nThe Dao—\nVast yet inexhaustible in use,\n[Empty within]\nas if it could never be filled.\n[The abyss—]\nProfound, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\n[The mind.]\n\nBlunt its sharpness,\n[Gather the spirit.]\nUntangle its knots,\n[Cease thoughts.]\nSoften its brilliance,\n[Conceal the mind within the mind, so it is not seen.]\nMerge with its dust.\n[Blend the mind with things.]\n\nLimpid, it seems to endure.\n[Preserve the spirit in Non-being.]\nI do not know—\nWhose child is it?\nIt seems the ancestor of the Emperor.\n\n**The Use of Emptiness**\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent—\n[Without intention]\nthey treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\n[Allowing them to be as they naturally are.]\nThe sage is not benevolent—\n[Taking the mind of Heaven and Earth as their own mind.]\nthey treat the hundred clans as straw dogs.\n[Having already forgotten the self, how could there be anything else?]\n\nThe space between Heaven and Earth—\n[The mind]\nis it not like a bellows?\n[Operating yet never exhausted.]\nEmpty yet never depleted,\n[Its use is inexhaustible.]\nThe more it moves, the more it produces.\n[Pure and unceasing.]\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\n[How can it be described?]\nBetter to guard the center.\n[Fulfill what lies within.]\n\n**Forming the Image**\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\n[This mind is originally without birth or death.]\nIt is called the Profound Female.\n[All share this one Heaven.]\nThe gateway of the Profound Female—\n[Where the thought stirs]\nis called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n[Only the mind.]\nSubtle, it seems to endure—\n[It is merely thus.]\nIts use is effortless.\n[Non-action—nothing more.]\n\n**Concealing Brilliance**\nHeaven is eternal, Earth enduring.\n[Abiding in non-action.]\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and enduring\n[The mind is also thus]\nis that they do not live for themselves.\n[This mind is ever-present.]\nThus, they can live long.\n[Originally without birth or death.]\n\nTherefore, the sage—\n[I]\nplaces the self behind yet finds the self ahead;\n[Present everywhere.]\nsets the self aside yet finds the self preserved.\n[Thus it has always been.]\nIs it not because they are without self-interest?\n[Heaven and Earth share the same root with me; the myriad things share the same body with me.]\nThus, they can fulfill their self-interest.\n[I am Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth are me.]\n\n**Easing Nature**\nThe highest good is like water—\n[Nature is like water.]\nWater is good—\n[It does not contend with things—nothing more.]\nBenefiting the myriad things yet not contending,\n[What intention did it originally have?]\nDwelling where the multitude abhor,\n[What does it have to do with me?]\nthus it is close to the Dao.\n[The mind is also thus.]\n\nIn dwelling, be good at the ground;\nIn the mind, be good at the abyss;\nIn giving, be good at benevolence;\nIn speech, be good at sincerity;\nIn governance, be good at rectitude;\nIn service, be good at ability;\nIn action, be good at timing.\nOnly by not contending—\n[The square inch does not compete]\ndoes one avoid fault.\n[Nor is it taken as fortune.]\n\n**Harmonizing the Vulgar**\nHold it and fill it—\n[Without lack or excess]\nbetter to stop.\n[Release body and mind.]\nSharpen it to a point—\n[Value desireless non-action]\nit cannot be preserved long.\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall,\n[Frugal in seeing, frugal in hearing—yet still in surplus]\nnone can guard it.\nWhen wealth and nobility breed arrogance,\n[Quiet the mind, do not employ it]\none invites one’s own misfortune.\nWhen merit is achieved and fame attained,\n[When the moon reaches the heart of Heaven, when the wind comes to the water’s surface]\nwithdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven.\n[Retreat to leave room.]\n\n**Chapter on Capacity**\n\nEmbrace the soul and spirit—\n[Pacify the heart]\nHold fast to the One.\nCan you never part from it?\n[Where would it go, where would it come from?]\nConcentrate qi to attain suppleness—\n[Pure clarity, utterly still]\nCan you be like an infant?\n[Utterly undivided]\nPurify and empty profound vision—\n[No affairs in the heart, no heart in affairs]\nCan you be without flaw?\n[Body and mind as one]\nCherish the people, govern the state—\n[Nurture spirit, cultivate qi]\nCan you practice non-action?\n[No thought, no doing, no deliberation, no worry]\nThe gates of Heaven open and close—\n[The mind’s ground, luminous and clear]\nCan you remain receptive?\n[One and not two]\nIllumined, penetrating the four directions—\n[Principle illumines things like ice melting, the moon shining]\nCan you be without knowledge?\n[All day like the fool]\nGive life, nurture life—\n[One heart holds all, enfolds the ten thousand images]\nGive life yet do not possess,\nAct yet do not rely,\nLead yet do not dominate—\n[Vast, without self]\nThis is called profound virtue.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Uselessness**\n\nThirty spokes converge on a single hub—\n[Like the thirty days of a month]\nTogether they form one wheel.\n[One month is thus]\nWhere there is nothing—\n[The moon’s waxing and waning]\nThere lies the use of the cart.\n[Though the moon wanes, it still completes a month]\nMold clay to make a vessel—\n[Yin and yang flow to create transformation]\nWhere there is nothing—\n[Heaven and Earth have no perfect work, the sage has no perfect ability]\nThere lies the use of the vessel.\n[Even with gaps, Heaven’s work is manifest]\nCut doors and windows to make a room—\n[The ten thousand images, luxuriant, share one Heaven]\nWhere there is nothing—\n[Spirit does not guard the house, the five senses lose their defense]\nThere lies the use of the room.\n[Sage and fool share the same nature, forgetting within to pursue without]\nThus, what exists is for benefit,\nWhat does not exist is for use.\n[Receive this body from father and mother for use;\nPreserve the original nature shared by all—without within.]\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Restraining Desire**\n\nThe five colors—\n[Green, yellow, red, white, black]\nMake the eyes blind.\n[The mechanism lies in the eye, the mind’s direction]\nThe five tones—\n[Gong, shang, jue, zhi, yu]\nMake the ears deaf.\n[Coveting externals, neglecting internals]\nThe five flavors—\n[Sweet, pungent, salty, sour, bitter]\nMake the mouth lose its taste.\n[Forgetting its natural state]\nRacing and hunting—\n[Monkey-mind, horse-qi]\nMake the heart go mad.\n[Unsettled body and mind, no place to return]\nRare and precious goods—\n[What use are gold and jade?]\nHinder conduct.\n[What is treasured is the heart; guard the One]\nThus the sage acts for the belly—\n[His joy is within]\nNot for the eyes.\n[Ears follow sound, eyes are deceived by color]\nTherefore, abandon that and take this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Disdaining Shame**\n\nFavor and disgrace both bring alarm—\n[No glory, no shame—this heart is serene]\nValue great trouble as you do the body.\n[Anticipate trouble, guard against it]\nWhat is meant by “favor and disgrace bring alarm”?\nDisgrace is lowly—\n[What people despise]\nGaining it brings alarm,\nLosing it brings alarm.\n[If it is not mine to possess,\nEven a hair’s breadth is not to be taken]\nThis is what is meant by “favor and disgrace bring alarm.”\n[What have they to do with me?]\nWhat is meant by “value great trouble as you do the body”?\nThe reason I have great trouble—\n[The heart’s unease, the body’s unrest]\nIs that I have a body.\nWhen I no longer have a body—\n[Utterly one with Heaven, I am not even I]\nWhat trouble could I have?\n[Forget self, forget the world—Heaven’s truth, natural]\nThus, one who values the body for the sake of the world—\n[The heart is like the ruler, the body like the world]\nMay be entrusted with the world.\nOne who cherishes the body for the sake of the world—\n[To govern the body is like governing the state]\nMay be relied upon for the world.\n[Can endure long without loss]\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Praising the Profound**\n\nLook and it cannot be seen—it is called *yi*.\n[The heart within the body]\nListen and it cannot be heard—it is called *xi*.\n[The nature within the heart]\nGrasp and it cannot be held—it is called *wei*.\n[The spirit within nature]\nThese three cannot be further questioned—\n[Cannot be spoken, only guarded]\nThus they merge into one.\nIts rising is not bright,\nIts sinking is not dark.\nUnceasing, unnameable—\n[From ancient times to now, shining alone, enduring]\nIt returns to nothingness.\n[See things and you see the heart]\nThis is called the formless form,\nThe imageless image—\n[The heart has no shape,\nNature has no form—one version reads “the imageless image”]\nThis is called the indistinct and evanescent.\n[The spirit has no coming or going]\nMeet it and you do not see its head,\nFollow it and you do not see its rear.\nHold to the ancient Dao—\n[Originally no perfection]\nTo master present being.\n[Originally no life or death]\nTo know the ancient beginning—\n[Ancient is now, now is ancient—let it be from ancient to now]\nThis is called the thread of the Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Manifesting Virtue**\n\nThe ancients who were good as scholars—\n[Illuminating the heart, seeing nature]\nWere subtly profound, mysteriously penetrating.\n[Holding fast to the center]\nDeep, beyond recognition.\n[My Dao is one that pervades all—cannot be heard]\nOnly because they were beyond recognition,\nI force myself to describe them:\nCautious, as if crossing a river in winter,\nHesitant, as if fearing neighbors on all sides,\nDignified, as if a guest,\nYielding, as ice about to melt,\nSimple, as uncarved wood,\nVast, as a valley,\nTurbid, as muddy water.\nWho can make the turbid clear through stillness?\nWho can bring forth life through calm?\nThose who preserve this Dao—\n[The Dao is not to be cultivated, only kept from defilement]\nDo not desire fullness.\nOnly because they are not full,\nThey can remain hidden,\nNot newly completed.\n\n**Returning to the Root**\n\nTo the utmost emptiness,\nHold fast to stillness.\nThe ten thousand things arise together—\nI thereby observe their return.\nAll things flourish,\nEach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nStillness is called returning to life.\nReturning to life is called constancy.\nKnowing constancy is called clarity.\nNot knowing constancy—\nReckless action invites calamity.\nKnowing constancy, one is all-embracing;\nAll-embracing, one is impartial;\nImpartial, one is kingly;\nKingly, one is of heaven;\nOf heaven, one is of the Dao;\nOf the Dao, one is enduring.\nThough the body perish, never in danger.\n\n**The Fading of Pure Custom**\n\nIn the highest antiquity,\nPeople knew it was there.\nNext, they drew near and praised it.\nNext, they feared it.\nNext, they scorned it.\nWhere trust is insufficient,\nDistrust arises.\nHow careful they were in their words!\nWhen tasks were accomplished and affairs completed,\nThe people all said, “We are naturally thus.”\n\n**The Decay of Custom**\n\nWhen the great Dao declined,\nBenevolence and righteousness arose.\nWisdom and cunning emerged—\nGreat hypocrisy followed.\nThe six relations fell out of harmony—\nFilial piety and kindness appeared.\nThe state fell into chaos and confusion—\nLoyal ministers arose.\n\n**Returning to Simplicity**\n\nCut off sageliness,\nAbandon wisdom—\nThe people benefit a hundredfold.\nCut off benevolence,\nAbandon righteousness—\nThe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nCut off skill,\nAbandon profit—\nThieves and robbers disappear.\nThese three,\nAs mere adornments, are not enough.\nThus let there be something to which they belong:\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nReduce self-interest, diminish desires.\n\n**Different from Custom**\n\nAbandon learning, and there is no sorrow.\nHow much difference is there between “yes” and “ah”?\nHow far apart are good and evil?\nWhat people fear,\nOne cannot but fear.\nYet how boundless it seems, unending!\nThe multitude are joyous,\nAs if feasting on the great sacrifice,\nAs if ascending the terrace in spring.\nI alone am tranquil, without sign,\nLike an infant who has not yet smiled,\nListless, as if with nowhere to return.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nWhile I alone seem lacking.\nI have the heart of a fool—\nSo muddled!\nThe common people are bright,\nI alone am dim.\nThe common people are sharp,\nI alone am dull.\nVast, like the sea,\nCeaseless, as if without end.\nThe multitude all have their use,\nWhile I alone am stubborn and crude.\nI alone differ from others,\nYet I value being fed by the Mother.\n\n**Chapter on the Hollow Heart**\n\nThe bearing of great virtue\nFollows only the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing—\nIs but dim, is but vague.\nVague, dim—\nYet within it there are images.\nDim, vague—\nYet within it there are forms.\nDeep, obscure—\nYet within it there is essence.\nIts essence is most true,\nWithin it there is trust.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name has never departed,\nBy which we behold the origin of all things.\nHow do I know the origin of all things?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter on Increasing Humility**\n\nTo bend is to be whole,\nTo twist is to be straight,\nTo hollow is to be filled,\nTo wear out is to be renewed,\nTo have little is to gain,\nTo have much is to be confused.\nTherefore the sage embraces the One\nAnd becomes the model for all under heaven.\nNot displaying oneself, one is seen clearly;\nNot asserting oneself, one is distinguished;\nNot boasting, one achieves merit;\nNot priding oneself, one endures.\nIt is only because one does not contend\nThat none under heaven can contend with one.\nThe ancient saying, “To bend is to be whole”—\nIs it empty words?\nTruly, to be whole is to return to it.\n\n**Chapter on Emptiness and Nothingness**\n\nSparse words are natural.\nA whirlwind does not last the morning,\nA sudden rain does not last the day.\nWho makes these? Heaven and earth.\nIf even heaven and earth cannot last long,\nHow much less can man?\nThus, those who align with the Dao\nAre one with the Dao.\nThose who align with virtue\nAre one with virtue.\nThose who align with loss\nAre one with loss.\nOne with the Dao, the Dao also embraces them;\nOne with virtue, virtue also embraces them;\nOne with loss, loss also embraces them.\nWhen trust is insufficient,\nThere is distrust.\n\n**Chapter on Bitter Kindness**\n\nThose who stand on tiptoe do not stand firm,\nThose who stride do not walk.\nThose who display themselves are not seen clearly,\nThose who assert themselves are not distinguished,\nThose who boast achieve no merit,\nThose who pride themselves do not endure.\nIn the Dao, these are called\n“Leftover food and superfluous actions,”\nWhich some things detest.\nThus, those who possess the Dao do not abide in them.\n\n**Chapter on the Origin of Images**\n\nThere is a thing, formless yet complete,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\nSilent, empty—\nStanding alone, unchanging,\nCircling endlessly, never exhausted,\nIt may be called the Mother of all under heaven.\nI do not know its name;\nI style it “Dao.”\nForced to name it, I call it “Great.”\nGreat means passing,\nPassing means far-reaching,\nFar-reaching means returning.\nThus the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nThe king is also great.\nWithin the realm, there are four greats,\nAnd the king occupies one of them.\nMan models himself on earth,\nEarth models itself on heaven,\nHeaven models itself on the Dao,\nThe Dao models itself on nature.\n\n**Chapter on Weight and Virtue**\n\nWeight is the root of lightness,\nStillness is the ruler of restlessness.\nThus the sage,\nThough traveling all day,\nDoes not part from the heavy supply wagon.\nThough there are glorious sights,\nHe remains detached, transcendent.\nHow can the lord of ten thousand chariots\nTreat his person lightly before all under heaven?\nIf he is light, he loses his ministers;\nIf he is restless, he loses his throne.\n\n**Chapter on Skillful Use**\n\nGood traveling leaves no tracks,\nGood speech has no flaws,\nGood reckoning uses no tally.\nGood closure needs no bolt yet cannot be opened,\nGood binding needs no rope yet cannot be undone.\nThus the sage\nIs always good at saving people,\nAnd so abandons no one;\nAlways good at saving things,\nAnd so abandons nothing.\nThis is called inheriting clarity.\nTherefore the good person\nIs the teacher of the not-good,\nAnd the not-good person\nIs the resource of the good.\nNot to value one’s teacher,\nNot to cherish one’s resource—\nThough wise, one is greatly deluded.\nThis is called the essential mystery.\n\n**Chapter on Returning to Simplicity**\n\nKnow its yang—**the spirit**—\nGuard its yin—**the nature**—\nTo be the world’s stream,\nTo be the world’s stream—**profound and wondrous**.\nVirtue ever constant does not depart,\nReturning to the state of infancy—**thoughtless**.\n\nKnow its brightness—**the nature**—\nGuard its darkness—**the destiny**—\nTo be the world’s model—**emptiness merging with the formless, wholly yielding to softness**,\nTo be the world’s model—**all perceptions, awareness, and knowledge utterly still**.\nVirtue ever constant knows no flaw,\nReturning to the boundless.\n\nKnow its glory—**the heart**—\nGuard its disgrace—**the self**—\nTo be the world’s valley—**only emptiness of all that is may be embraced; nothing may be imposed upon the void**,\nTo be the world’s valley—**hollow within**.\nVirtue ever constant is thus fulfilled,\nReturning to simplicity—**the Great Primal, the boundless**.\nWhen simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels—**the Supreme Ultimate arises, and the Two Modes emerge**.\nThe sage employs it—**knowing this principle**—\nAnd thus becomes a leader—**as if in awe**.\nTherefore, great governance is uncut—**the heart is one with emptiness; emptiness is not the heart**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Non-Action**\n\nThose who would seize all under heaven and act upon it—\nI see they cannot succeed—**the Dao is fundamentally non-action**.\nAll under heaven is a sacred vessel—**the dwelling of the heart**—\nIt cannot be acted upon—**no doing, no ceasing, no grasping, no extinguishing**.\nThose who act upon it ruin it,\nThose who grasp it lose it—**the foolish chase externals, the wise cling to internals; the sage transcends both. I, too, am no sage**.\n\nThus, some things advance, others follow—**mind fixed upon this**;\nSome breathe gently, others blow—**thoughts without deviation**;\nSome are strong, others weak—**skillful use of the heart**;\nSome bear, others destroy—**profound contemplation of this principle**.\nTherefore, the sage—**the self**—\nAbandons excess—**too much is as bad as too little**,\nAbandons extravagance—**the Dao is ever thus**,\nAbandons excessiveness—**the Dao is never lacking**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Frugality and Warfare**\n\nOne who assists a ruler with the Dao—**the Dao unites with the heart**—\nDoes not use arms to dominate all under heaven—**excelling in victory through non-contention**.\nSuch affairs readily return—**returning to the root, restoring destiny**.\nWhere armies encamp—**where the heart’s warfare arises**—\nThorns and brambles grow—**the heart is disturbed, the spirit wild**.\nIn the wake of great armies—**the heart races with things, affairs contend with the mind**—\nThere must be inauspicious years—**essence and desire driven, spirit and qi depleted**.\n\nThus, the skillful achieve their aim—**through the power of concentration**—\nYet dare not seize strength—**merely forgetting the self**.\nAchieving their aim, they do not boast—**waiting in stillness**,\nAchieving their aim, they do not vaunt—**guarding in silence**,\nAchieving their aim, they are not arrogant—**preserving harmony**,\nAchieving their aim, it is only when unavoidable—**employing emptiness**.\nThis is achieving one’s aim without force—**emptiness and spontaneity**.\nWhen things grow strong, they age—**the heart is swayed by things**—\nThis is called not following the Dao—**nature obscured by the heart**.\nNot following the Dao, they perish early—**the spirit stifled by nature**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Laying Down Arms**\n\nFine weapons are inauspicious tools—**using the heart to overcome things ultimately fails**—\nSome things detest them—**lured by things**.\nThus, those with the Dao do not dwell in them.\nTherefore, the noble person at rest values the left—**forgetting the heart**—\nIn warfare, values the right—**relying on the true**.\nWeapons are inauspicious tools—**only when unavoidable are they used**—\nNot the tools of the noble person—**meeting challenges without contention, affairs pass, the heart remains serene**.\nOnly when unavoidable are they used—**seeking to align with the Dao, yet failing to align**—\nSerenity is supreme—**tranquil**.\nVictory is not celebrated—**concentrating desire, the spirit does not concentrate**.\nThose who celebrate it—**focusing the will without distraction, the spirit coalesces**—\nDelight in killing—**eliminating desire**.\nThose who delight in killing—**utterly detached**—\nCannot achieve their will in all under heaven.\n\nThus, auspicious affairs honor the left—**do not follow the heart’s lead**—\nInauspicious affairs honor the right—**let the heart be the master**.\nThe deputy general stands on the left—**diminishing the heart**—\nThe supreme general stands on the right—**preserving the spirit**.\nThis is to handle them with mourning rites—**as if guarding one’s parents**.\nWhen the slain are many—**the six thieves’ armies stilled, the three-foot flame unburning, the root’s multitude**—\nMourn them with sorrowful tears—**the heart dies, the spirit remains**.\nWhen victorious in battle, handle it with mourning rites—**the solitary light shines alone**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Sagely Virtue**\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\nThough simplicity is small—**yet vast**—\nAll under heaven dare not treat it as a subject.\nIf lords and kings can guard it—**guarding the One**—\nThe ten thousand things will naturally submit—**the heart as master, things as guests**.\nHeaven and earth unite—**body and heart as one**—\nTo send down sweet dew—**the Great Dao attained**.\nThe people, without command, naturally harmonize—**the heart unburdened, the body at ease; the heart non-active, the spirit naturally transforms**.\n\nAt the beginning, systems create names—**the Dao**.\nOnce names exist—**the heart**—\nOne must also know when to stop—**nature**.\nKnowing when to stop is how one avoids peril—**the spirit**.\nThe Dao’s presence in all under heaven—**the heart within me**—\nIs like valleys and streams flowing to rivers and seas—**the ten thousand things return to the One, returning to the One alone**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Discerning Virtue**\n\nOne who knows others is wise—**not turned by things**—\nOne who knows oneself is enlightened—**the heart uniting with the Dao**.\nOne who overcomes others has strength—**long abiding in the Dao, transformation naturally occurs**—\nOne who overcomes oneself is mighty—**true accumulation of power endures**.\nOne who knows contentment is rich—**what thing is not the Dao?**\nOne who acts with determination has resolve—**where there is resolve, affairs are accomplished**.\nOne who does not lose their place endures—**nature ever present**.\nOne who dies yet does not perish is long-lived—**the spirit does not perish**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Accomplishing Tasks**\n\nThe Great Dao flows—**the heart without direction**—\nIt may be left or right—**utterly without knowledge**.\nThe ten thousand things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse—**the Great Dao does not give life, yet life cannot escape it; the myriad transformations self-generate, the Great Dao does not give life**.\nIts work accomplished, it does not claim possession—**truly, nothing is gained**.\nIt nurtures the ten thousand things—**the Dao can foster things**—\nYet does not act as their master—**forgetting its origin**.\nThus, it is ever without desire—**yet does not act as master**—\nAnd may be called small—**though the Dao is small, it pervades the ten thousand things**.\nThe ten thousand things return to it—**when one can empty the heart, the Dao naturally returns**—\nYet it does not act as their master—**if even the self is not seen, what can be possessed?**\nAnd may be called great—**what does it not contain?**\nTherefore, the sage—**the heart**—\nNever acts as great—**a grain holds worlds, a mustard seed contains Mount Sumeru**—\nAnd thus can accomplish greatness—**the buddhas’ dharma-body enters my nature; my nature unites with the Tathāgata**.\n\n**Chapter on Benevolent Virtue**\nGrasping the great image—**the world comes to it**—\nComing yet unharmed—**the Dao knows no spirits, moves alone, arrives alone**—\nSecure, peaceful, and stable—**when the heart is at peace, nature is level; when nature is level, spirit is at ease**.\nDelight and bait—**following the heart without transgressing bounds**—\nPassing travelers halt—**wayward thoughts naturally cease**.\nThe Dao emerges from the mouth—**bland yet flavorful**—\nSo faint it seems flavorless—**the flavor of flavorlessness**.\nGazing, it cannot be seen—**the Dao has no form**—\nListening, it cannot be heard—**the Dao has no sound**—\nIts use is inexhaustible—**the Dao is without end**.\n\n**Chapter on Subtle Clarity**\nDesiring to contract it—**gathering the heart**—\nOne must first expand it—**forgetting things**.\nDesiring to weaken it—**forgetting speech**—\nOne must first strengthen it—**forgetting the self**.\nDesiring to abolish it—**forgetting the heart**—\nOne must first establish it—**forgetting nature**.\nDesiring to seize it—**forgetting spirit**—\nOne must first bestow it—**forgetting the Dao**.\nThis is called subtle illumination—**forgetting what is gained**.\nThe soft and weak overcome the hard and strong—**roaming the heart among things without being confined by them**.\nFish cannot leave the depths—**the heart does not depart from the Dao**.\nThe state’s sharpest instruments—**heavenly principle remains firm**—\nCannot be shown to others—**human desires naturally exhaust themselves**.\n\n**Chapter on Governance**\nThe Dao is ever non-action—**its use is inexhaustible**—\nYet nothing is left undone—**what can it not accomplish?**\nIf lords and kings can hold to it—**the heart arises from the Dao**—\nThe ten thousand things will transform themselves—**all transformations are natural**.\nWhen transformation stirs desire—**a single thought arises**—\nI will suppress it with nameless simplicity—**knowing the true unity where the six senses cease**.\nNameless simplicity—**the Dao is ever non-action**—\nWill also not desire—**yet nothing is left undone**.\nThe world will right itself—**body and heart as one; the original true self settles into stillness**.\n\n**Chapter on Virtue**\nHighest virtue is not virtuous—**without attachment**—\nThus it possesses virtue—**not claiming possession of what it has**.\nLesser virtue does not lose virtue—**bound and obstructed**—\nThus it lacks virtue—**incompatible with the Dao**.\nHighest virtue acts without acting—**nothing to engage the heart**—\nAnd has no purpose in acting—**what is there to do?**\nLesser virtue acts—**pursuing delusion, losing truth**—\nAnd has purpose in acting—**the Dao cannot be acted upon**.\nHighest benevolence acts—**uniting the heart with the Dao**—\nYet has no purpose in acting—**still and unmoving**.\nHighest righteousness acts—**taking things as the heart, obscuring what is seen**—\nAnd has purpose in acting—**flowing without return**.\nHighest ritual acts—**the Dao follows nature**—\nYet none respond to it—**far removed from the Dao**—\nThen they roll up their sleeves and drag others—**self-obscuring their heaven**.\nThus, losing the Dao, then virtue—**unable to spiritually master spirit**—\nLosing virtue, then benevolence—**unable to naturally master nature**—\nLosing benevolence, then righteousness—**unable to master the heart with the heart**—\nLosing righteousness, then ritual—**already lost their truth**.\nRitual is the thinness of loyalty and trust, the beginning of chaos—**no longer natural**.\nForeknowledge is the flower of the Dao, the beginning of foolishness—**knowing cannot be known**.\nThus, the great man dwells in thickness, not thinness—**returning to simplicity, reverting to the uncarved**—\nAbides in reality, not its blossoms—**withdrawing sight, returning hearing**.\nTherefore, he rejects that and takes this—**turning the light inward, reflecting**.\n\n**Chapter on the Root of the Law**\nOf old, those who attained the One—**who am I?**\nHeaven attained the One and became clear—\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil—\nSpirits attained the One and became numinous—\nValleys attained the One and became full—\nThe ten thousand things attained the One and came to life—\nLords and kings attained the One and became the world’s standard—\nTheir attainment was the same—**of old, those who attained the One**.\nWithout heaven’s clarity, it would fear splitting—**heaven follows the Dao**—\nWithout earth’s tranquility, it would fear erupting—**earth follows heaven**—\nWithout spirits’ numinosity, they would fear vanishing—**the Dao follows nature**—\nWithout valleys’ fullness, they would fear drying—**the Dao is simply One**—\nWithout the ten thousand things’ life, they would fear perishing—**thus, reject that and take this**—\nWithout lords and kings’ standard, exalted and lofty, they would fear stumbling—**the One, unmoving; the ten thousand transformations, natural**.\nThus, nobility takes lowliness as its root—**spirit is the foundation of nature**—\nLoftiness takes lowness as its base—**nature is the root of the heart**.\nTherefore, lords and kings—**the heart**—\nCall themselves orphaned, widowed, and barren—**no use for their use**.\nIs this not taking lowliness as their root?—**only the Dao as their body**.\nIs it not?—\nThus, attaining many carriages is no carriage—**no self**.\nDo not desire to gleam like jade—**not possessing what one has**—\nOr clatter like stone—**preserving wholeness, originally clattering**.\n\n**Chapter on Rejecting Use**\nReversion is the movement of the Dao—**preserving spirit with nature**—\nWeakness is the function of the Dao—**preserving nature with the heart**.\nThe world’s things are born from being—**preserving the heart with the self, originally things as the ten thousand things**—\nBeing is born from non-being—**preserving the self with no-self**.\n\n**Chapter on Sameness and Difference**\nThe highest scholar hears the Dao—**eagerly practices it**—**like a handless man desiring to box**.\nThe middling scholar hears the Dao—**as if present, as if absent**—**a mute dreaming**.\nThe lowest scholar hears the Dao—**laughs greatly at it**—**the common people use it daily yet do not know**.\nWithout laughter, it would not suffice as the Dao—**thus, established words say**:\nIlluminating the Dao seems dim—**not dimming the original**—\nAdvancing the Dao seems retreating—**diminishing daily in the pursuit of the Dao**—\nLeveling the Dao seems uneven—**not generating distinctions**—\nHighest virtue seems like a valley—**embracing the ten thousand transformations**—\nGreat whiteness seems tarnished—**greatness contains all**—\nVast virtue seems insufficient—**fearing it is not enough**—\nEstablished virtue seems lazy—**constantly bearing this thought, one illumination, one application**—\nTrue substance seems altered—**not taking oneself as I**—\nGreat squares have no corners—**spirit has no direction**—\nGreat vessels are late in completion—**the Dao is born before the ten thousand things yet completed after them**—\nGreat sounds are rarely heard—**nothing to perceive**—\nGreat images have no form—**nothing to name or describe**—\nThe Dao is hidden, without name—**nothing to say**.\nOnly the Dao—**excels at lending and completing**—**able to transform transformations without self-transformation**.\n\n**Chapter on the Transformations of the Dao**\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang; through the blending of qi, they achieve harmony.\n\nWhat people despise are only \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"unworthy,\" yet kings and lords take these as their titles. Thus, things may be diminished yet gain, or gain yet diminish.\n\nWhat others teach, I also teach: \"There is neither One nor Two.\" The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural end, for they cannot reach the state of no-self. I shall take this as the father of all teachings.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Universal Application**\n\nThe softest under heaven (the Dao) gallops through the hardest (things and self). That which has no form enters where there is no gap. Thus I know the benefit of non-action. Few in the world can attain this: the many are clear and bright, while I alone am dull and obscure.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Establishing Precepts**\n\nWhich is dearer, name or self? Which is greater, self or wealth? Which is more harmful, gain or loss? Therefore, excessive love incurs great cost; hoarding wealth leads to heavy loss. Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger. Thus one may endure long.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Vast Virtue**\n\nGreat perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible. Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is boundless. Great straightness seems bent; great skill seems clumsy; great eloquence seems inarticulate. Movement overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat. Clarity and stillness set the world right.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Moderating Desires**\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize fields. When the world loses the Dao, battle steeds are bred in the suburbs. No crime is greater than indulging desire; no disaster is greater than discontent; no fault is greater than covetousness. Thus, knowing contentment’s sufficiency is ever sufficient.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Discerning Afar**\n\nWithout stepping outside, one knows the world; without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows. Therefore, the sage knows without traveling, names without seeing, and accomplishes without acting.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Forgetting Knowledge**\n\nPursuing learning increases daily; pursuing the Dao decreases daily. Decrease and again decrease, until one reaches non-action. Through non-action, nothing is left undone. Thus, to govern the world, one must be without affairs. If affairs arise, one is unfit to govern the world.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Embracing Virtue**\n\nThe sage has no fixed heart but takes the hearts of the people as his heart. The good, I treat as good; the not-good, I also treat as good—thus attaining goodness. The trustworthy, I trust; the untrustworthy, I also trust—thus attaining trust. The sage, in the world, is unassuming, blending his heart with the world. The people all fix their ears and eyes upon him, and the sage treats them all as children.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Valuing Life**\n\nEmerging into life, entering into death: thirteen are the companions of life; thirteen are the companions of death. Why is this? Because of the thickness of life’s nurturing.\n\nIt is said that those who skillfully nourish life do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers on land, nor are they harmed by weapons in battle. The rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn; the tiger finds nowhere to sink its claws; weapons find nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this? Because they have no place of death.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Cultivating Virtue**\n\nThe Dao gives them life; virtue nurtures them; things shape them; circumstances complete them. Therefore, the ten thousand things all honor the Dao and value virtue. The honor of the Dao and the value of virtue arise not by command but by constant spontaneity.\n\nThus, the Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, rears and raises them, completes and matures them, nourishes and shelters them. It creates yet does not possess; acts yet does not rely; leads yet does not dominate—this is called profound virtue.\n\n**Chapter on Returning to the Profound**\n\nThe world has a beginning—this is the Mother of all under heaven. Having attained the Mother, one knows Her children. Having known the children, one returns to guard the Mother. Though the body perish, there is no danger.\n\nSeal the apertures, close the gates—throughout life, there is no toil. Open the apertures, meddle in affairs—throughout life, there is no salvation. Perceiving the small is called clarity; guarding softness is called strength. Employing one’s light, returning to clarity—no calamity befalls the self. This is called practicing the constant.\n\n**Chapter on Increasing Evidence**\n\nWere I to possess even a little knowledge, I would walk the great Dao—yet I fear only straying from it. The great Dao is utterly level, yet the people prefer byways.\n\nThe court is excessively adorned; the fields are overgrown with weeds; the granaries are utterly empty. They wear embroidered robes, gird themselves with sharp swords, sate themselves with food and drink, and hoard surplus wealth—these are called thieves and boasters. Such is not the Dao!\n\n**Chapter on Cultivating Observation**\n\nThose who skillfully establish do not uproot; those who skillfully embrace do not lose. Their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n\nCultivate it in the self—its virtue becomes genuine. Cultivate it in the family—its virtue becomes abundant. Cultivate it in the village—its virtue becomes enduring. Cultivate it in the state—its virtue becomes bountiful. Cultivate it in the world—its virtue becomes universal.\n\nThus, observe the self through the self; observe the family through the family; observe the village through the village; observe the state through the state; observe the world through the world. How do I know the world is thus? By this.\n\n**Chapter on the Profound Correspondence**\n\nProfound virtue is deep—it is like an infant. Poisonous insects do not sting it; fierce beasts do not seize it; birds of prey do not strike it. Its bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grasp is firm. It knows not the union of male and female, yet its organ stirs—such is the perfection of its essence. It cries all day without its throat growing hoarse—such is the perfection of its harmony.\n\nKnowing harmony is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Augmenting life is called auspicious; the mind directing qi is called strength. When things grow strong, they age—this is called not-Dao. What is not-Dao perishes early.\n\n**Chapter on Profound Virtue**\n\nThose who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.\n\nSeal the apertures, close the gates; blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots; harmonize the light, merge with the dust—this is called profound union.\n\nThus, it cannot be made near, nor can it be made distant; it cannot be benefited, nor can it be harmed; it cannot be honored, nor can it be debased. Therefore, it is precious under heaven.\n\n**Chapter on Pure Transformation**\n\nGovern the state with uprightness; deploy troops with strategy; take the world with non-action. How do I know this is so? By this.\n\nThe more taboos there are in the world, the poorer the people become. The more sharp tools people possess, the more benighted the state grows. The more skill and cunning people have, the more strange things arise. The more laws and decrees are proclaimed, the more thieves and bandits appear.\n\nTherefore, the sage says: I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves.\n\n**Chapter on Following Transformation**\n\nWhen governance is dull, the people are simple; when governance is exacting, the people are lacking.\n\nDisaster—where fortune leans; fortune—where disaster lurks. Who knows their limit? There is no constant standard. The normal reverts to the strange; the good reverts to the ominous. The people’s delusion has lasted long indeed.\n\nThus, the sage is square but does not cut; is sharp but does not pierce; is straight but does not stretch; is bright but does not dazzle.\n\n**Chapter on Guarding the Dao**\n\nIn governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality. For frugality is to be early in compliance. Being early in compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue. With the repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome. Having overcome all, none can fathom its limit. None can fathom its limit, and thus one may possess the state. Possessing the state’s mother, one may endure long. This is called deep roots and firm foundation—the Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\n**Chapter on Occupying Position**\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish. When the Dao is applied to the world, its demons lose their numinosity. Not that its demons lose their numinosity, but their numinosity no longer harms people. Not that their numinosity no longer harms people, but the sage also does not harm people. As neither harms the other, virtue converges upon them both.\n\n**Chapter on Humble Virtue**\n\nA great state is the lower reaches of a river, the confluence of all under Heaven, the female of the world. The female always overcomes the male through stillness, and stillness is to be below. Thus, when a great state humbles itself before a small state, it wins the small state. When a small state humbles itself before a great state, it wins the great state. Therefore, some humble themselves to win, while others humble themselves and win. A great state desires only to gather and nurture people; a small state desires only to enter and serve others. When both obtain what they desire, the greater should remain below.\n\n**Chapter on the Dao’s Function**\n\nThe Dao is the mystery of the myriad things, the treasure of the good, and the refuge of the not-good. Fine words can be traded in the marketplace; noble conduct can be bestowed upon others. Why then abandon those who are not good? Thus, when the Son of Heaven is established and the Three Dukes are appointed, though one may offer jade discs followed by teams of horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing this Dao. Why was this Dao so valued in ancient times? Did they not say that by seeking, one obtains, and by having faults, one is exempted? Thus, it is treasured by all under Heaven.\n\n**Chapter on the Origin of Grace**\n\nPractice non-action; attend to non-affairs; savor the tasteless. Whether great or small, many or few, repay enmity with virtue. Plan for difficulty while it is easy; act on the great while it is small. The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy; the great affairs of the world must arise from the small. Therefore, the sage never strives for greatness and thus accomplishes greatness. One who makes promises lightly is seldom trusted; one who takes things lightly will encounter many difficulties. Therefore, the sage treats all as difficult and thus never encounters difficulty.\n\n**Chapter on Guarding Against**\n\nWhat is secure is easy to maintain; what shows\n\n**Chapter on Putting Oneself Last**\n\nThe reason rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys is that they excel in staying low. Thus, they become kings of all valleys. Therefore, when the sage wishes to be above the people, he must speak humbly; when he wishes to lead the people, he must put himself behind. Thus, though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome; though he stands ahead, the people do not find him harmful. Therefore, the world delights in exalting him without wearying. Because he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him.\n\n**Chapter on the Three Treasures**\n\nAll under Heaven say my Dao is great, yet it seems unlike anything. Precisely because it is great, it seems unlike anything. If it resembled anything, it would long since have been small. I possess three treasures that I treasure and hold fast: the first is compassion; the second is frugality; the third is not daring to be first in the world. Through compassion, one can be courageous; through frugality, one can be expansive; by not daring to be first in the world, one can become the vessel of leadership. Now, if one abandons compassion yet seeks courage, abandons frugality yet seeks expansiveness, abandons the last yet seeks the first, this is death. For compassion, when used in battle, brings victory; when used in defense, it brings firmness. Heaven will save such a one, guarding him with compassion.\n\n**Chapter on Matching Heaven**\n\nThe skilled warrior is not martial; the adept in battle is not enraged; the master of victory does not contend; the one who excels in employing others places himself below. This is called the virtue of non-contention; this is called the power of employing others; this is called matching Heaven—the ultimate of antiquity.\n\n**Chapter on the Mysterious Use**\n\nThere is a saying in the use of arms: \"I dare not act as host but act as guest; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\" This is called marching without marching, raising the arm without raising it, confronting the enemy without confronting, wielding weapons without wielding them. No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy. Underestimating the enemy endangers my treasures. Thus, when evenly matched armies clash, the side that grieves will prevail.\n\n**Chapter on Knowing Difficulty**\n\nMy words are very easy to know and very easy to practice, yet none in the world can know or practice them. Words have their origin; affairs have their master. It is only through ignorance that they do not know me. Those who know me are rare; thus, I am esteemed. Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.\n\n**Chapter on Knowing Illness**\n\nTo know yet seem not to know is supreme; not to know yet claim to know is illness. Only by recognizing illness as illness can one avoid illness. The sage is without illness because he recognizes illness as illness; thus, he is without illness.\n\n**Chapter on Loving Oneself**\n\nWhen the people do not fear authority, great authority will arrive. Do not constrict their dwelling; do not stifle their livelihood. Only by not stifling them will they not be stifled. Therefore, the sage knows himself but does not display his knowledge; loves himself but does not exalt himself. Thus, he discards the latter and embraces the former.\n\n**Chapter on Acting Without Force**\n\nCourage in daring leads to death; courage in not daring leads to life. Of these two, one brings benefit, the other harm. Who knows the reason for Heaven’s aversion? Thus, even the sage finds this difficult. The Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels in victory; does not speak yet excels in response; is not summoned yet comes of itself; is unhurried yet excels in planning. Heaven’s net is vast and wide; though its mesh is coarse, nothing slips through.\n\n**Chapter on Controlling Delusion**\n\nThe people do not fear death—why threaten them with it? If the people always feared death, and I could seize and kill those who act strangely, who would dare? There is always an executioner who kills. To kill in place of the executioner is like hewing in place of the master carpenter. Few who hew in place of the master carpenter do not injure their own hands.\n\n**Chapter on Avarice and Harm**\n\nThe people suffer hunger—\nbecause their superiors consume too much in taxes.\nThis is why they hunger.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern—\nbecause their superiors act with excessive effort.\nThis is why they are difficult to govern.\n\nThe people treat death lightly—\nbecause they pursue life with such intensity.\nThis is why they treat death lightly.\n\nOnly those who do not make life their aim\nare wiser than those who prize life.\n\n**Chapter on Warning Against Force**\n\nWhen people are born, they are soft and weak;\nwhen they die, they are stiff and strong.\nAll things—plants and trees—are soft and fragile in life;\nwhen they die, they are withered and dry.\nThus, the stiff and strong are companions of death;\nthe soft and weak are companions of life.\nTherefore, when weapons are strong, they do not prevail;\nwhen the root is strong, it breaks.\nThe strong and great dwell below;\nthe soft and weak dwell above.\n\n**Chapter on the Dao of Heaven**\n\nThe Dao of Heaven—\nis it not like the drawing of a bow?\nWhat is high is pressed down;\nwhat is low is raised up.\nWhat has excess is diminished;\nwhat is deficient is replenished.\nThe Dao of Heaven\ndiminishes excess to supplement deficiency.\nThe Dao of Man is not so—\nit diminishes the deficient to serve the excess.\nWho can take their excess and offer it to the world?\nOnly those who possess the Dao.\nThus, the sage acts without relying on it,\naccomplishes without dwelling in it,\nand does not desire to display worth.\n\n**Chapter on Trust and Reliance**\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong.\nNothing can replace it.\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard;\nthe weak overcomes the strong.\nThere is none in the world who does not know this,\nyet none can practice it.\nTherefore, the sage says:\nTo bear the nation’s disgrace\nis to be called the lord of the altars of soil and grain.\nTo bear the nation’s misfortune\nis to be called the king of all under Heaven.\nStraightforward words seem paradoxical.\n\n**Chapter on Holding the Contract**\n\nWhen great resentment is reconciled,\nsome resentment necessarily remains.\nHow can this be considered good?\nThus, the sage holds the left half of the contract\nbut does not demand payment from others.\nThose with virtue oversee the contract;\nthose without virtue oversee exactions.\nThe Dao of Heaven shows no partiality—\nit always aligns with the good.\n\n**Chapter on Independence**\n\nLet the state be small, its people few.\nLet there be tools enough for tens or hundreds,\nyet let them not be used.\nLet the people regard death as weighty\nand not wander far.\nThough there be boats and carriages,\nnone will ride them.\nThough there be armor and weapons,\nnone will display them.\nLet the people return to knotting cords for record-keeping.\nLet them savor their food,\nadmire their clothing,\nfeel at ease in their dwellings,\nand delight in their customs.\nNeighboring states may be within sight of one another,\nthe sounds of their chickens and dogs may be heard,\nyet the people will grow old and die\nwithout ever coming or going.\n\n**Chapter on Manifesting Substance**\n\nTruthful words are not beautiful;\nbeautiful words are not truthful.\nThe good do not argue;\nthose who argue are not good.\nThe wise are not broadly learned;\nthe broadly learned are not wise.\nThe sage does not accumulate—\nhaving given all to others,\nthey possess even more.\nHaving bestowed all upon others,\nthey have even greater abundance.\nThe Dao of Heaven\nbenefits and does not harm.\nThe Dao of the sage\nacts and does not contend.",

      "translated_text": "**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries**\n**Section: Masters (Subcategory 14) – Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue**\n**Daoist School – Abstract**\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note:\n\n*Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue* (*Daode baozhang*), in one fascicle, was composed by Ge Changgeng of the Song dynasty. Changgeng, styled Baisou, was a native of Minqing in Fujian and a Daoist priest residing on Mount Wuyi. The original edition bore the title *Purple Clarity Perfected One Bai Yuchan*, for \"Bai Yuchan\" was his sobriquet, and \"Purple Clarity Perfected One\" the title conferred upon him when summoned to the imperial court during the Jiading era. His commentary follows the text with annotations, eschewing philological exegesis of characters or phrases, nor does it extensively elaborate. His glosses are often sparser than the original scripture’s passages, and their purport frequently resembles Chan gāthās—no doubt because Buddhism and Daoism share a common source.\n\nThis edition was hand-copied and engraved by Zhao Mengfu of the Yuan dynasty, its calligraphy and carving executed with exquisite precision. Chen Jiru of the Ming later reprinted it in his *Compendium of Secret Writings*, retitling it *Toad Immortal’s Explication of the Laozi*, though this diverges from the original title. Additionally, two postscripts by the Recluse of Shiyuan Residence, dated the *guiwei* year of the Wanli reign, precede the text. The first postscript cites *Dong You’s Catalogue of Collected Books*, which records Zhang Daoxiang’s *Anthology of Ancient and Modern Commentaries on the Laozi*, comprising over forty schools—yet omits this work. Now, Zhang Daoxiang was a man of the Tianbao era of the Tang; how could he have included a book from the Ningzong period of the Southern Song in his catalogue? Moreover, Zhang’s anthology lists twenty-nine schools, plus his own commentary, totaling thirty—not \"over forty.\" The postscript’s claims appear to be hearsay.\n\nChanggeng is traditionally regarded as an immortal. Liu Kezhuang’s collected works include a preface to *Wang Yu’s Six Studies and Nine Books*, wherein he recounts meeting four alchemists: Zou Ziyi, who did not reach seventy; Zeng Jingjian and Huang Tiangu, who barely reached sixty; and Bai Yuchan, who died young. Furthermore, Chen Zhensun’s *Book Catalogue with Abstracts* states under *Collected Pearls and Jade of the Immortals*: \"Bai Yuchan, surnamed Ge, was a native of Minqing in Fuzhou. He once committed a crime and fled into exile—truly a reckless and deceitful rogue.\" While serving as magistrate of Nancheng, I encountered a sojourning scholar who inquired whether I had ever met this man. I replied, \"How could such a person be permitted to cross my threshold?\" Both accounts, contemporaneous with Changgeng, suggest that popular legends likely arose from later embellishments. However, Daoists naturally exalt their own tradition, and such tendencies are common. Since his book contains much of value, there is little need to scrutinize the man too closely.\n\nRespectfully submitted for imperial review in the tenth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.\n\n**Chief Compilers:**\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi",

I, too, am no sage**.\n\nThus, some things advance, others follow—**mind fixed upon this**;\nSome breathe gently, others blow—**thoughts without deviation**;\nSome are strong, others weak—**skillful use of the heart**;\nSome bear, others destroy—**profound contemplation of this principle**.\nTherefore, the sage—**the self**—\nAbandons excess—**too much is as bad as too little**,\nAbandons extravagance—**the Dao is ever thus**,\nAbandons excessiveness—**the Dao is never lacking**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Frugality and Warfare**\n\nOne who assists a ruler with the Dao—**the Dao unites with the heart**—\nDoes not use arms to dominate all under heaven—**excelling in victory through non-contention**.\nSuch affairs readily return—**returning to the root, restoring destiny**.\nWhere armies encamp—**where the heart’s warfare arises**—\nThorns and brambles grow—**the heart is disturbed, the spirit wild**.\nIn the wake of great armies—**the heart races with things, affairs contend with the mind**—\nThere must be inauspicious years—**essence and desire driven, spirit and qi depleted**.\n\nThus, the skillful achieve their aim—**through the power of concentration**—\nYet dare not seize strength—**merely forgetting the self**.\nAchieving their aim, they do not boast—**waiting in stillness**,\nAchieving their aim, they do not vaunt—**guarding in silence**,\nAchieving their aim, they are not arrogant—**preserving harmony**,\nAchieving their aim, it is only when unavoidable—**employing emptiness**.\nThis is achieving one’s aim without force—**emptiness and spontaneity**.\nWhen things grow strong, they age—**the heart is swayed by things**—\nThis is called not following the Dao—**nature obscured by the heart**.\nNot following the Dao, they perish early—**the spirit stifled by nature**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Laying Down Arms**\n\nFine weapons are inauspicious tools—**using the heart to overcome things ultimately fails**—\nSome things detest them—**lured by things**.\nThus, those with the Dao do not dwell in them.\nTherefore, the noble person at rest values the left—**forgetting the heart**—\nIn warfare, values the right—**relying on the true**.\nWeapons are inauspicious tools—**only when unavoidable are they used**—\nNot the tools of the noble person—**meeting challenges without contention, affairs pass, the heart remains serene**.\nOnly when unavoidable are they used—**seeking to align with the Dao, yet failing to align**—\nSerenity is supreme—**tranquil**.\nVictory is not celebrated—**concentrating desire, the spirit does not concentrate**.\nThose who celebrate it—**focusing the will without distraction, the spirit coalesces**—\nDelight in killing—**eliminating desire**.\nThose who delight in killing—**utterly detached**—\nCannot achieve their will in all under heaven.\n\nThus, auspicious affairs honor the left—**do not follow the heart’s lead**—\nInauspicious affairs honor the right—**let the heart be the master**.\nThe deputy general stands on the left—**diminishing the heart**—\nThe supreme general stands on the right—**preserving the spirit**.\nThis is to handle them with mourning rites—**as if guarding one’s parents**.\nWhen the slain are many—**the six thieves’ armies stilled, the three-foot flame unburning, the root’s multitude**—\nMourn them with sorrowful tears—**the heart dies, the spirit remains**.\nWhen victorious in battle, handle it with mourning rites—**the solitary light shines alone**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Sagely Virtue**\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\nThough simplicity is small—**yet vast**—\nAll under heaven dare not treat it as a subject.\nIf lords and kings can guard it—**guarding the One**—\nThe ten thousand things will naturally submit—**the heart as master, things as guests**.\nHeaven and earth unite—**body and heart as one**—\nTo send down sweet dew—**the Great Dao attained**.\nThe people, without command, naturally harmonize—**the heart unburdened, the body at ease; the heart non-active, the spirit naturally transforms**.\n\nAt the beginning, systems create names—**the Dao**.\nOnce names exist—**the heart**—\nOne must also know when to stop—**nature**.\nKnowing when to stop is how one avoids peril—**the spirit**.\nThe Dao’s presence in all under heaven—**the heart within me**—\nIs like valleys and streams flowing to rivers and seas—**the ten thousand things return to the One, returning to the One alone**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Discerning Virtue**\n\nOne who knows others is wise—**not turned by things**—\nOne who knows oneself is enlightened—**the heart uniting with the Dao**.\nOne who overcomes others has strength—**long abiding in the Dao, transformation naturally occurs**—\nOne who overcomes oneself is mighty—**true accumulation of power endures**.\nOne who knows contentment is rich—**what thing is not the Dao?**\nOne who acts with determination has resolve—**where there is resolve, affairs are accomplished**.\nOne who does not lose their place endures—**nature ever present**.\nOne who dies yet does not perish is long-lived—**the spirit does not perish**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Accomplishing Tasks**\n\nThe Great Dao flows—**the heart without direction**—\nIt may be left or right—**utterly without knowledge**.\nThe ten thousand things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse—**the Great Dao does not give life, yet life cannot escape it; the myriad transformations self-generate, the Great Dao does not give life**.\nIts work accomplished, it does not claim possession—**truly, nothing is gained**.\nIt nurtures the ten thousand things—**the Dao can foster things**—\nYet does not act as their master—**forgetting its origin**.\nThus, it is ever without desire—**yet does not act as master**—\nAnd may be called small—**though the Dao is small, it pervades the ten thousand things**.\nThe ten thousand things return to it—**when one can empty the heart, the Dao naturally returns**—\nYet it does not act as their master—**if even the self is not seen, what can be possessed?**\nAnd may be called great—**what does it not contain?**\nTherefore, the sage—**the heart**—\nNever acts as great—**a grain holds worlds, a mustard seed contains Mount Sumeru**—\nAnd thus can accomplish greatness—**the buddhas’ dharma-body enters my nature;

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on the Transformations of the Dao**\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang; through the blending of qi, they achieve harmony.\n\nWhat people despise are only \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"unworthy,\" yet kings and lords take these as their titles. Thus, things may be diminished yet gain, or gain yet diminish.\n\nWhat others teach, I also teach: \"There is neither One nor Two.\" The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural end, for they cannot reach the state of no-self. I shall take this as the father of all teachings.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Universal Application**\n\nThe softest under heaven (the Dao) gallops through the hardest (things and self). That which has no form enters where there is no gap. Thus I know the benefit of non-action. Few in the world can attain this: the many are clear and bright, while I alone am dull and obscure.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Establishing Precepts**\n\nWhich is dearer, name or self? Which is greater, self or wealth? Which is more harmful, gain or loss? Therefore, excessive love incurs great cost; hoarding wealth leads to heavy loss. Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger. Thus one may endure long.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Vast Virtue**\n\nGreat perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible. Great fullness seems empty, yet its use is boundless. Great straightness seems bent; great skill seems clumsy; great eloquence seems inarticulate. Movement overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat. Clarity and stillness set the world right.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Moderating Desires**\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize fields. When the world loses the Dao, battle steeds are bred in the suburbs. No crime is greater than indulging desire; no disaster is greater than discontent; no fault is greater than covetousness. Thus, knowing contentment’s sufficiency is ever sufficient.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Discerning Afar**\n\nWithout stepping outside, one knows the world; without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows. Therefore, the sage knows without traveling, names without seeing, and accomplishes without acting.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Forgetting Knowledge**\n\nPursuing learning increases daily; pursuing the Dao decreases daily. Decrease and again decrease, until one reaches non-action. Through non-action, nothing is left undone. Thus, to govern the world, one must be without affairs. If affairs arise, one is unfit to govern the world.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Embracing Virtue**\n\nThe sage has no fixed heart but takes the hearts of the people as his heart. The good, I treat as good; the not-good, I also treat as good—thus attaining goodness. The trustworthy, I trust; the untrustworthy, I also trust—thus attaining trust. The sage, in the world, is unassuming, blending his heart with the world. The people all fix their ears and eyes upon him, and the sage treats them all as children.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Valuing Life**\n\nEmerging into life, entering into death: thirteen are the companions of life; thirteen are the companions of death. Why is this? Because of the thickness of life’s nurturing.\n\nIt is said that those who skillfully nourish life do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers on land, nor are they harmed by weapons in battle. The rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn; the tiger finds nowhere to sink its claws; weapons find nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this? Because they have no place of death.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Cultivating Virtue**\n\nThe Dao gives them life; virtue nurtures them; things shape them; circumstances complete them. Therefore, the ten thousand things all honor the Dao and value virtue. The honor of the Dao and the value of virtue arise not by command but by constant spontaneity.\n\nThus, the Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, rears and raises them, completes and matures them, nourishes and shelters them. It creates yet does not possess; acts yet does not rely; leads yet does not dominate—this is called profound virtue.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Returning to the Profound**\n\nThe world has a beginning—this is the Mother of all under heaven. Having attained the Mother, one knows Her children. Having known the children, one returns to guard the Mother. Though the body perish, there is no danger.\n\nSeal the apertures, close the gates—throughout life, there is no toil. Open the apertures, meddle in affairs—throughout life, there is no salvation. Perceiving the small is called clarity; guarding softness is called strength. Employing one’s light, returning to clarity—no calamity befalls the self. This is called practicing the constant.\n\n**Chapter on Increasing Evidence**\n\nWere I to possess even a little knowledge, I would walk the great Dao—yet I fear only straying from it. The great Dao is utterly level, yet the people prefer byways.\n\nThe court is excessively adorned; the fields are overgrown with weeds; the granaries are utterly empty. They wear embroidered robes, gird themselves with sharp swords, sate themselves with food and drink, and hoard surplus wealth—these are called thieves and boasters. Such is not the Dao!\n\n**Chapter on Cultivating Observation**\n\nThose who skillfully establish do not uproot; those who skillfully embrace do not lose. Their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n\nCultivate it in the self—its virtue becomes genuine. Cultivate it in the family—its virtue becomes abundant. Cultivate it in the village—its virtue becomes enduring. Cultivate it in the state—its virtue becomes bountiful. Cultivate it in the world—its virtue becomes universal.\n\nThus, observe the self through the self; observe the family through the family; observe the village through the village; observe the state through the state; observe the world through the world. How do I know the world is thus? By this.\n\n**Chapter on the Profound Correspondence**\n\nProfound virtue is deep—it is like an infant. Poisonous insects do not sting it; fierce beasts do not seize it; birds of prey do not strike it. Its bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grasp is firm. It knows not the union of male and female, yet its organ stirs—such is the perfection of its essence. It cries all day without its throat growing hoarse—such is the perfection of its harmony.\n\nKnowing harmony is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Augmenting life is called auspicious; the mind directing qi is called strength. When things grow strong, they age—this is called not-Dao. What is not-Dao perishes early.\n\n**Chapter on Profound Virtue**\n\nThose who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.\n\nSeal the apertures, close the gates; blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots; harmonize the light, merge with the dust—this is called profound union.\n\nThus, it cannot be made near, nor can it be made distant; it cannot be benefited, nor can it be harmed; it cannot be honored, nor can it be debased. Therefore, it is precious under heaven.\n\n**Chapter on Pure Transformation**\n\nGovern the state with uprightness; deploy troops with strategy; take the world with non-action. How do I know this is so? By this.\n\nThe more taboos there are in the world, the poorer the people become. The more sharp tools people possess, the more benighted the state grows. The more skill and cunning people have, the more strange things arise. The more laws and decrees are proclaimed, the more thieves and bandits appear.\n\nTherefore, the sage says: I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves.\n\n**Chapter on Following Transformation**\n\nWhen governance is dull, the people are simple; when governance is exacting, the people are lacking.\n\nDisaster—where fortune leans; fortune—where disaster lurks. Who knows their limit? There is no constant standard. The normal reverts to the strange; the good reverts to the ominous.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Guarding the Dao**\n\nIn governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality. For frugality is to be early in compliance. Being early in compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue. With the repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome. Having overcome all, none can fathom its limit. None can fathom its limit, and thus one may possess the state. Possessing the state’s mother, one may endure long. This is called deep roots and firm foundation—the Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\n**Chapter on Occupying Position**\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish. When the Dao is applied to the world, its demons lose their numinosity. Not that its demons lose their numinosity, but their numinosity no longer harms people. Not that their numinosity no longer harms people, but the sage also does not harm people. As neither harms the other, virtue converges upon them both.\n\n**Chapter on Humble Virtue**\n\nA great state is the lower reaches of a river, the confluence of all under Heaven, the female of the world. The female always overcomes the male through stillness, and stillness is to be below. Thus, when a great state humbles itself before a small state, it wins the small state. When a small state humbles itself before a great state, it wins the great state. Therefore, some humble themselves to win, while others humble themselves and win. A great state desires only to gather and nurture people; a small state desires only to enter and serve others. When both obtain what they desire, the greater should remain below.\n\n**Chapter on the Dao’s Function**\n\nThe Dao is the mystery of the myriad things, the treasure of the good, and the refuge of the not-good. Fine words can be traded in the marketplace; noble conduct can be bestowed upon others. Why then abandon those who are not good? Thus, when the Son of Heaven is established and the Three Dukes are appointed, though one may offer jade discs followed by teams of horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing this Dao. Why was this Dao so valued in ancient times? Did they not say that by seeking, one obtains, and by having faults, one is exempted? Thus, it is treasured by all under Heaven.\n\n**Chapter on the Origin of Grace**\n\nPractice non-action; attend to non-affairs; savor the tasteless. Whether great or small, many or few, repay enmity with virtue. Plan for difficulty while it is easy; act on the great while it is small. The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy; the great affairs of the world must arise from the small. Therefore, the sage never strives for greatness and thus accomplishes greatness. One who makes promises lightly is seldom trusted; one who takes things lightly will encounter many difficulties. Therefore, the sage treats all as difficult and thus never encounters difficulty.\n\n**Chapter on Guarding Against**\n\nWhat is secure is easy to maintain; what shows",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Putting Oneself Last**\n\nThe reason rivers and seas can be kings of all valleys is that they excel in staying low. Thus, they become kings of all valleys. Therefore, when the sage wishes to be above the people, he must speak humbly; when he wishes to lead the people, he must put himself behind. Thus, though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome; though he stands ahead, the people do not find him harmful. Therefore, the world delights in exalting him without wearying. Because he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him.\n\n**Chapter on the Three Treasures**\n\nAll under Heaven say my Dao is great, yet it seems unlike anything. Precisely because it is great, it seems unlike anything. If it resembled anything, it would long since have been small. I possess three treasures that I treasure and hold fast: the first is compassion; the second is frugality; the third is not daring to be first in the world. Through compassion, one can be courageous; through frugality, one can be expansive; by not daring to be first in the world, one can become the vessel of leadership. Now, if one abandons compassion yet seeks courage, abandons frugality yet seeks expansiveness, abandons the last yet seeks the first, this is death. For compassion, when used in battle, brings victory; when used in defense, it brings firmness. Heaven will save such a one, guarding him with compassion.\n\n**Chapter on Matching Heaven**\n\nThe skilled warrior is not martial; the adept in battle is not enraged; the master of victory does not contend; the one who excels in employing others places himself below. This is called the virtue of non-contention; this is called the power of employing others; this is called matching Heaven—the ultimate of antiquity.\n\n**Chapter on the Mysterious Use**\n\nThere is a saying in the use of arms: \"I dare not act as host but act as guest; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\" This is called marching without marching, raising the arm without raising it, confronting the enemy without confronting, wielding weapons without wielding them. No disaster is greater than underestimating the enemy. Underestimating the enemy endangers my treasures. Thus, when evenly matched armies clash, the side that grieves will prevail.\n\n**Chapter on Knowing Difficulty**\n\nMy words are very easy to know and very easy to practice, yet none in the world can know or practice them. Words have their origin; affairs have their master. It is only through ignorance that they do not know me. Those who know me are rare; thus, I am esteemed. Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.\n\n**Chapter on Knowing Illness**\n\nTo know yet seem not to know is supreme; not to know yet claim to know is illness. Only by recognizing illness as illness can one avoid illness. The sage is without illness because he recognizes illness as illness; thus, he is without illness.\n\n**Chapter on Loving Oneself**\n\nWhen the people do not fear authority, great authority will arrive. Do not constrict their dwelling; do not stifle their livelihood. Only by not stifling them will they not be stifled. Therefore, the sage knows himself but does not display his knowledge; loves himself but does not exalt himself. Thus, he discards the latter and embraces the former.\n\n**Chapter on Acting Without Force**\n\nCourage in daring leads to death; courage in not daring leads to life. Of these two, one brings benefit, the other harm. Who knows the reason for Heaven’s aversion? Thus, even the sage finds this difficult. The Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels in victory; does not speak yet excels in response; is not summoned yet comes of itself; is unhurried yet excels in planning. Heaven’s net is vast and wide; though its mesh is coarse, nothing slips through.\n\n**Chapter on Controlling Delusion**\n\nThe people do not fear death—why threaten them with it? If the people always feared death, and I could seize and kill those who act strangely, who would dare? There is always an executioner who kills. To kill in place of the executioner is like hewing in place of the master carpenter. Few who hew in place of the master carpenter do not injure their own hands.",

Therefore, the sage never strives for greatness and thus accomplishes greatness. One who makes promises lightly is seldom trusted; one who takes things lightly will encounter many difficulties. Therefore, the sage treats all as difficult and thus never encounters difficulty.\n\n**Chapter on Guarding Against**\n\nWhat is secure is easy to maintain; what shows",
