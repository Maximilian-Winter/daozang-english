  "full_translation": "**Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing* Commentary**\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing***\nComposed by **Shi Changchen**, likely from the **Northern Song dynasty**.\nRecorded in *Comprehensive Records of Literature and Arts* (*Tongzhi Yiyong*).\nOne volume.\nSource of the base text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era), **Tongzhen Section (Jewel Precepts Category)**.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Yin Fu Jing* Commentary**\n\nMan is born between Heaven and Earth.\nHis form is bestowed by his parents,\nHis **qi** received from yin and yang,\nAnd his body bears all things.\n\nYet his body aligns with **Dao/Way** in response to phenomena,\nAnd what is profoundly resonant within the human heart\nIs none other than the *Yin Fu Jing*.\n\nIn ancient times, after the death of **Pouxi** (the mythical culinary sage),\n**Shennong** (the Divine Farmer) emerged,\nAnd the Yellow Emperor composed **book-contracts** (written records),\nCommanding **Cangjie** (the legendary inventor of Chinese characters)\nTo observe the forms of birds and beasts,\nThe patterns of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd employ the symbols of all things\nTo create writing—\nThus did the **ghosts and spirits weep**,\nAnd **Dao/Way** first revealed its profound mysteries?\n\n**Dao/Way**, once transformed into **affairs** (practical applications),\nThen into **mechanisms** (strategic principles),\nAnd the deployment of these mechanisms—\nThe highest reveals **moral virtue/power** and governance,\nThe middle offers **techniques for preserving life and body**,\nThe lowest expounds on **conquest and national stability**,\nComprehensive yet without omission.\n\nAt that time,\nThe Yellow Emperor, the **first ancestor of Daoism**,\nDesiring to propagate the **authentic Daoist teachings**,\nReceived from **Yuan Nü** (the Primordial Maiden) over three hundred words,\nAnd further expounded with a hundred more,\nSummarizing the **ultimate principles of all transformations**,\nUniting the **mysteries of all spirits**,\nConcealing the profound and subtle,\nEmbracing Heaven and encompassing Earth—\nIts **precepts are concise**, its **meanings profound**,\nIts **logic deep**, its **principles unfathomable**,\nFor those who attain **self-realization** through **Dao/Way**.\n\nI have examined the commentaries of various scholars,\nYet their interpretations diverge in doctrine,\nTheir explanations rooted in partial perspectives,\nOnly recognizing the *Yin Fu Jing* as the Yellow Emperor’s **authoritative teachings**,\nNot acknowledging **Yuan Nü’s** transmission.\n\nHowever, the *Inner Transmission* records:\nThe Yellow Emperor received from **Yuan Nü** the **essence of the *Yin Fu Jing***,\nMastering the **inner harmony with Heaven’s mechanisms**,\nAnd the **outer alignment with human affairs**—\nThus the **three hundred words** were indeed **Yuan Nü’s** transmission,\nWhile the **hundred words** were the Yellow Emperor’s **elaboration**.\n\nHence, its **language is succinct yet its intent vast**,\nIts **meanings profound**, its **principles deep**—\nObserve its **strange instruments**,\nWhich **generate all phenomena**,\nThe **Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems**,\nThe **divine mechanisms and hidden secrets**—\nThe **art of yin and yang overcoming each other** is clearly revealed beyond mere symbols.\n\nTo comprehend this is to exhaust the *Yin Fu Jing*’s meaning—\nLater generations cannot surpass it.\nWhen **Confucius** lectured on the *Yijing* (I Ching)\nAnd expounded its **appended commentary** (*Shi Ci*),\nThe **Dao/Way of the *Yijing*** was fully elucidated—\nTruly, **books cannot exhaust speech, nor speech exhaust meaning**—\nWhat more can be said?\n\nThus, I boldly **pruned the old commentaries**,\nAnd **composed new annotations**,\nEnsuring **verification and practical application** without error.\n\nMoreover, the **Yellow Old School** (referring to Yellow Emperor and Laozi)\nEstablished its teachings:\n**Dao/Way** values **gathering the void**,\nLofty discourse and sweeping principles,\nDetached from worldly conventions and customs,\nNot enticing the **profane** with superficial explanations,\nBut revealing only the **core insights of the sages**.\n\nThose who **contemplate its intent** grasp its **multifaceted wonders**,\nAnd the **erudite** attain its **subtle profundities**—\nIts **precepts originate from the Three Sovereigns**,\nIts **teachings extend through all ages**,\nEnriching the **strategies of benevolent rulers**,\nSupplying the **tools of virtuous ministers**.\n\nFrom the **Qin and Han dynasties** above,\nTo the **Sui and Tang dynasties** below,\nGenerals and eminent ministers,\nAscetics and **recluse Daoists**,\nThose who annotated and commented on it are innumerable.\n\nNow, the *Yin Fu Jing*’s **application** lies in **Heaven’s mechanisms**—\nIf it **resonates within the heart**,\nHow could it be called a **minor supplement**?\n\n**Shi Changchen** humbly composes this preface.\n\n---\n\n**The *Yin Fu Jing*’s Historical Account**\n\nIn ancient times, the **Western Queen Mother** descended upon **Wangwu Mountain**,\nGranting the Yellow Emperor **martial arts**,\nAnd he **defeated Chi You** in the **Zhuolu wilderness**,\nExterminating **demonic chaos**,\nEliminating **heavenly calamities**.\n\nThen he **governed the states and clans**,\nEstablished **shrines and ancestral altars**,\nAllotted **lands and territories**,\nAnd appointed **feudal lords**—\nThe **Five Phases** (elements) were fixed,\nAnd **great bandits** were eradicated.\n\nThe Queen Mother sent **Yuan Nü** again\nTo transmit the Yellow Emperor **secret precepts**—\nNineteen chapters of the *Inner Transmission*,\nAnd the *Yin Fu Jing*’s **three hundred words**—\nIncluding **alchemical formulas for gold elixirs and jade seals**,\n**Talismans that soar through the void**,\n**Methods of traversing fire and walking on water**—\nAll were fully encompassed.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor then **established the Bureau of Welcoming Immortals**,\n**Refined the essentials of ascension**,\nAnd **revealed sacred texts and secret scriptures**\nTo broaden **Daoist teachings**—\nThus all within the **Six Realms** (Heaven, Earth, and the four directions)\nWere **beneficially guided**.\n\nFrom **Dongting Lake**, he **rode a fire dragon** and ascended,\nHis **sword and sandals buried** by his ministers at **Bashan Mountain**—\nThe records clearly attest to this.\n\nThis **scripture** was transmitted to posterity,\nSo that later ages might **embody and practice** it—\nThus the **benevolent** see it as **benevolence**,\nAnd the **wise** see it as **wisdom**.\n\nThose who **awaken to its truths**,\nGenerally grasp the **sequential principles of Dao/Way and techniques**\nTo **manifest virtue and conceal practical applications**;\nThose who **peruse its logic**,\nAttain **self-realization** through **Dao/Way**.\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing***\n\n**Shi Changchen**, **Deputy Keeper of the Jianlong Daoist Observatory**,\nAnd **Purple-Robed Master of Preservation and Peace**,\nNow elucidates the *Yin Fu Jing*:\n\n**Chapter on the Embracing of One by Immortals and Daoists**\n*\"Preserve essence and safeguard **qi**—\nThe **spirit** then abides.\nTo attain **Dao/Way** and not die—\nThis is called **ascension (xian)**.\"*\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way of immortals and Daoists**\nResonates with humanity like **valley spirits**,\nAs **Laozi** described: *\"Valley spirits do not die.\"*\n\nWhat man **preserves** is his **spirit**,\nWhat he **encounters** is **transformation**—\nTo **embrace One** means all things\n**Carry yin while embracing yang**,\nHence it is called *\"**Dao/Way** generates One.\"*\n\nThough **numbers** extend to **ten thousand billions**,\nThey all **originate from One**—\nThis chapter seeks to **broadly transmit and comprehensively elucidate**\nLike a **moon reflected in water**,\n**Manifesting without fail.**\n\nThus, it is **marked as the first chapter**.\n\n**To observe Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,\nAnd to **grasp Heaven’s actions**—\nThis is exhaustive.**\n\nHeaven’s **Dao/Way** flows and **accumulates nowhere**,\nThus all things **generate**.\nHence, **phenomena have forms** that can be observed,\n**Dao/Way is formless** yet can be **attained**—\nIf **phenomena** are **self-perceived**,\nThen to **know Heaven’s actions**,\nSilently **respond to transformation**—\nThis is to **grasp Heaven’s actions**.\n\n**Actions** refer to the **unfixed states**,\nThus **Dao/Way’s** **cyclical rotation** like a **hinge**—\nOnly when one **finds its center**,\nDoes one **achieve its boundlessness**;\n**Heaven** is **vast and complete**,\nEncompassing all spirits,\n**Guarding through emptiness**,\n**Rooting in tranquility**—\nIf man’s heart is **like the Great Emptiness**,\nAnd **touches phenomena in alignment with **Dao/Way**,\nUnobstructed by **material fixation**,\nAnd **unmoved**—\nThen **phenomena** will **respond without fail**,\nAnd **self and phenomena** will **both be forgotten**—\nThus one **attains the profound mysteries**.\"\n\n「Thus, one who possesses the innate quality to receive the **Dao/Way**,\nShall have **no intent**, **no fixed certainty**, **no rigidity**, **no self**—\nWhen **actions** align with **divine resonance**,\nLeft and right, one finds its source—\nThis is how the **Sage** achieves **non-action** yet **nothing left undone**.\n\nFor indeed, such a one **fully** and **exhaustively** grasps it.\nFrom this perspective,\nThe **observer** observes with the **heart**, not with the **eyes**,\nThe **holder** grasps with the **heart**, not with the **hands**—\n**Without observation or fixation**,\n**Heaven’s actions** are **attained**.\n\n**Heaven** has five **thieves**—\nThose who recognize them flourish.\nThe principles of **things** are:\n**Thieves of merit** (功),\n**Thieves of skill** (巧),\n**Thieves of timing** (時),\n**Thieves of substance** (物),\n**Thieves of life** (命)—\nAll are **Heaven’s** doing,\nNot what man can **force**.\n\nYet **Great Yu** stole **merit**,\n**Gongshu Ban** stole **skill**,\n**Confucius** stole **timing**,\n**Fan Li** stole **substance**,\n**Laozi and Pengzu** stole **life**—\nThus the **thieves** are **takers**.\nThese five masters **understood Heaven’s resonance**,\nAnd thus they became **Internal Saints and Outer Kings**.\n\nThe five **thieves**—\nMetaphorically speaking,\nIn **Heaven** they are the **Five Stars**,\nOn earth they are the **Five Sacred Mountains**,\nIn man they are the **Five Zang Organs**—\nBroadly considered,\nTheir methods **internalized**,\nIn **Dao** are called **Xian** (仙),\nIn **Confucianism** are called **Yuan** (元).\nTaking from afar,\nThey are **external things**;\nTaking from near,\nThey are **internal desires**.\nThe **central master** of **internal desires**,\nThe **heart** enslaved by **external appearances**—\nEven dwelling in mountains and forests yet **not inwardly at rest**,\nIs called **sitting idleness** (坐驰),\nAnd one **loses their natural authenticity** (天真),\nFor they **do not perceive** the **essence** of the five **thieves**,\nAnd **internal heat** disturbs their chest—\n**Zhuangzi** called this **burning their Heavenly Harmony** (天和).\n\nMan’s nature and inclinations vary—\nWhat pleases one displeases another,\nWhat suits one does not suit another,\nEach **fixates** on their **partial view**,\nUnable to **respond** to the **unbounded**—\nThus those who **recognize** them become **fully accomplished masters**.\n\n**Actions** must **perceive resonance**,\nThus one can **command things**,\nNot be **enslaved** by them.\nIf **Dao/Way** is the **sovereign ruler**,\nAnd one **does not follow things**,\nThen the metaphor of the five **thieves** applies to the **immediate world**—\nThe **heart** perceives them,\nAnd they lie **within one’s grasp**—\nIf one **uses them well**, they become the **Five Powers** (五德),\nIf one **uses them poorly**, they become the **Five Thieves**—\nThus one **flourishes**.\n\nThe five **thieves** dwell in the **heart**,\nYet their **manifestations** extend to **Heaven**—\nTheir **functions** are **applied** across **Heaven, Earth, and Man**,\nYet they **never cease** to be present,\nOnly **restrained by the heart**—\nThus **Dao/Way** is in **things**,\nThe **heart** is in the **body**—\n**Dao/Way** does not **follow things**,\nThe **heart** does not **move with the body**,\nThen it is **firmly unshakable**.\n\nSuch are those with **Dao/Way**,\nWho **govern before chaos arises**,\nAnd **preserve the realm before peril comes**.\n\nOne **resonance** moves, and a hundred **spirits** follow—\nIs **Heaven** so distant?\nHow **profound** is it?\nThe **heart’s** reach, when **perceiving resonance**,\n**Aligns with Heaven**—\nWhat **distance** is there, then?\n\nThis is how the **heart’s** **operations** unfold.\n\nThe **cosmos** lies within the **hand**,\nAll **transformations** arise from the **body**—\nThe **light and pure** belong to **Heaven**,\nThe **heavy and turbid** belong to **Earth**,\nThe **cosmos** is the **ultimate** of **up and down**.\n\nHow can the **cosmos** be **held** in the **hand**?\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"Grasp the **Great Form** (大象),\nAnd **all under Heaven** will **come forward** (往).\"*\nThe **hand**—\n**Dominates Heaven and Earth**,\n**Cycles through Yin and Yang**,\n**Oversees** the **Dao/Way’s** **movement** like **turning a wheel**—\nTruly, the **cosmos** lies within the **hand**.\n\nThe **Immortal** also said:\n*\"There are those who perceive the **resonance of Creation** (造化机),\nWith their **hands** they **grasp** the **sun and moon**,\nStable as **furnaces** within their **bodies**—\nLike **knocking on a mystical door**,\n**Relying on the artisan’s skill**—\nThis speaks of **profound mysteries**, beyond **explicit words**.\"*\n\nAll **transformations**—\nThe **collective name** for **things**—\nYet it is said they **arise from the body**,\nFor the **body** is the **substance of life**,\nAnd man is the **spirit** of all **things**—\nThe **body** **contains** the **qi** of **Heaven and Earth**,\nAnd the **Four Great Elements** (空中四大) are **all encompassed** within it.\n\nThe **head** is **round**, mirroring **Heaven**,\nThe **feet** are **square**, mirroring **Earth**,\nThe **center** is **harmonious**—the **body**—\nThe **body** is **one with Heaven and Earth**.\n\nAs **Liezi** said:\n*\"Between **Heaven and Earth**, a single **thread**—\nIs it not that all **transformations** arise from the **body**?\"*\nTo **observe the body**,\nOne can **know** the **arising of all transformations**.\n\n**Heaven’s** nature is **humanity** (人也),\nThe **human heart** is **resonance** (機也).\n**Wealth and honor** are what man **desires**,\n**Poverty and lowliness** are what man **abhors**.\nMan’s nature—\n**To love life and hate death**,\n**To seek benefit and avoid harm**—\nAll are **bestowed by Heaven**.\n\nAs when man **pursues a principle**,\n**Awakens to a method**,\n**Completes a matter**—\nIt is through **practice** that they **attain** it.\nThus **Heaven’s** **endowment** of nature,\n**No one attains without seeking**—\nThe **heart** holds **far-reaching aspirations**,\n**Cultivating the body** to **achieve** them.\n\nThe **vulgar** call this **delusive thinking** (妄想),\nYet they **do not know** that **delusive thinking** is the **ladder** to **Dao/Way**—\nThus **Heaven’s** nature is **made by man**,\nAnd the **human heart** is **driven by resonance**—\nWhen man **dwells in stillness**, it is the **heart**,\nWhen man **moves**, it is the **resonance**—\nHow much more so when **Heaven’s resonance** is **triggered**,\nAnd one can **sit and advance** into this **Dao/Way**,\nHow can it be **compared** to those who **merely prattle**?\n\nThus the **nature of man** is **known**.\n\n**Establish Heaven’s Dao/Way**,\nTo **settle humanity**—\n**Heaven’s Dao/Way** is **still** while **humanity’s Dao/Way** is **active**,\n**Active** aligns with **Yang’s virtue/power**,\n**Still** aligns with **Yin’s essence**—\n**Motionless and tranquil**,\nYet **stirred** and **immediately responsive**—\nThe **Sage** **receives humanity with emptiness**,\nAnd thus can **reflect back**.\n\n**Humanity’s Dao/Way** is **easily moved** yet **hard to still**,\nTo **know its stillness** is to **align with Heaven**—\nAs **Laozi** said:\n*\"Returning to the **root** is called **stillness**,\n**Stillness** is called **restoring life** (复命).\"*\nTo **be settled** then to **respond**,\nIs to **exhaust principles** and **fulfill nature**.\n\nThus **establishing Heaven’s Dao/Way** to **guide humanity**,\nIf man **knows Heaven’s silent operations**,\nThen he can **embody transformation** and **discard worldly filth**,\nThe **heart** like a **clear mirror**,\n**Responsive** without end,\n**Playing with Heaven’s Dao/Way**—\nIn **humanity’s Dao/Way**, what **distance** remains?\n\nWhen **Heaven** **triggers** the **resonance of killing**,\n**Dragons and snakes** rise onto **land**.\nWhen **man** **triggers** the **resonance of killing**,\n**Heaven and Earth** **reverse and overturn**.\nWhen **Heaven and man** **trigger together**,\nAll **changes** are **fixed by resonance**—\n**Heaven and man’s Dao/Way** are **distant** yet **respond nearby**,\n**Moving with the times**—\nThis is to **respond to Heaven** and **follow humanity**.\n\nIf one **does not grasp the times** yet **acts**,\nThey will **never** **meet resonance** or **embrace transformation**—\nAnd indeed,\nWithin the **Four Great Elements** of the **world**,\nEven **Heaven**, the **highest**, **dares not** **arbitrarily trigger** in man,\nFor fear **dragons and snakes** will rise onto **land**.\"\n\n「Thus, dragons **conceal** themselves in **water**,\nsnakes **hide** in **marshes**,\nbut when they do not **conceal** and **cross** onto **land**,\nthis **reveals** Heaven’s **triggering**.\n\nMan, if he **does not grasp** the **times of Heaven** yet **acts**,\nthen Heaven and Earth **become obscured and darkened**,\nand **yin-yang** **err in sequence**,\nturning day into night to **warn** of man’s **arbitrary triggering**.\n\nThus, Heaven **acts** through man,\nand man **acts** through Heaven’s **times**—\nif man **discerns the resonance** and **acts with the times**,\neven **ghosts and spirits** **dare not** **fathom** his **intentions**,\nand **yin-yang** **dare not** **know** his **mysteries**.\nHis **commands and orders** will **never** be **in vain**—\nthis is called **harmonious triggering**.\n\nWhen man’s **resonance** **aligns with Dao/Way**,\nand he **silently contracts** with Heaven’s **true nature**,\nthen the **Three Powers** **fix** their **positions**,\nand the **Five Agents** **lift** their **functions**.\nAs in ancient times when the **Eight Hundred Lords** gathered at **Mengjin’s banks**,\nwas this not also called **Heaven and man’s harmonious triggering**?\n\nThose who **master the Dao of governance** must **not** **cling to tradition** to **achieve alignment**,\nbut **investigate ancient precedents** to **apply** them,\n**accumulate merit** through **action** to **seek** it—\nthen they will **not** lose their **purpose**.\n\nIndeed, the **still** yet **sage**,\nand the **active** yet **kingly**,\nthese **are** those whose **Dao/Way** **harmonizes** with **Heaven and man**—\nHeaven **does not defy** them,\nand **how much less** would man?\n\nThis is the **time of Heaven and man’s harmonious triggering**.\n\n**Nature** has **skill and clumsiness**—\nit can be **concealed** or **revealed**.\nThe **nature of skill and clumsiness** lies in man—\nit can be **bent** or **extended**,\n**acting** when the **resonance** is **discerned**,\n**concealing** his **vessel** within the **body**,\n**waiting** for the **times** to **act**,\nso that men **see** his **manifestation** but **not** his **concealment**.\n\nIndeed, there are those who **find their own field**,\nand yet **preserve** their **body** and **avoid harm** so as to **escape** regret—\nwhat **more** could the **virtuous/powerful** need?\n\nThus it is said:\n*The state’s **precious instruments***\n**must not** be **shown** to the people.\nThen the **greatest skill** appears as **clumsiness**,\nand **deep concealment** is **not** **abhorred**.\nWhen **turned** and **used**,\nthis becomes **noble**.\n\nThe **nine orifices’** **harmful tendencies** lie in the **Three Essentials**,\nand can be **governed by stillness and motion**.\nThe **ancient sages** set **sight and hearing**, **eating and breathing**, and **great and small** as the **nine orifices**,\nand **established the Three Essentials** to **guard** their **stillness and motion**,\nso as **not** to lose their **true nature**.\nIndeed, the **master** of one **body** lies only in the **heart**’s **Nine Essentials**—\nthus it is said: *the heart’s **harmful tendencies** lie in the **Three Essentials**.*\n\nTherefore, those who **cultivate qi** and **nourish the heart**,\nmust **upright** their **body’s essentials**,\n**straighten** their **intentions’ essentials**,\nand **balance** their **heart’s essentials**—\nthis is the **governance of the Three Essentials of the heart**,\nnot the **nine orifices** of **ears, eyes, mouth, and nostrils**.\n\nStillness and motion **rest** in man,\nand **qi** **makes** them so.\n**Hold** your **resonance** firm,\n**do not** **exhaust** your **qi**;\n**upright** your **heart**,\n**do not** **indulge** its **harmful tendencies**.\nThus, the *Three Hundred Poems*,\nin one **phrase** **summed up**,\nsay: *Think not of harmful tendencies*.\n\nThis is truly **nourishing** one’s **innate true nature**.\n\n**Fire** **arises** from **wood**,\nand **disaster** **triggered** must **overcome**.\n**Deceit** **arises** from the **state**,\nand **resonance** **triggered** must **break**.\n\nTo **know** and **refine** it is called **sagehood**.\nIndeed, **wood** **generates fire**,\nbut **fire** **overcomes wood** in return—\n**man** **generates deeds**,\nbut **deeds** **betray man** in return.\nThus the **analogy of fire and wood** **holds**.\n\nMan’s **ignorance** **accumulates** **anger-qi**,\nand he **does not** **self-regulate**,\n**internally consuming** Heaven’s **harmony** and **bringing about** his **end**.\nIf such a man **discerns** the **natural furnace and tripod**,\nand **refines** it within his **body**,\nthen his **virtue/power** becomes **true**.\n\nSuch a man **can embody** Heaven’s **law** and **follow** the Dao/Way,\n**making** the **state** **free of deceitful ministers**,\nand his **self** **free of false actions**.\nYet even those **near** the **sages** **still** **err** and **lose** it;\n**how much farther** are those who **aspire** to **sagehood**?\n\nHeaven **gives life** and **takes life**—\nthis is the **principle** of the Dao/Way.\nWhen **things** **arrive unexpectedly**, it is called **life**;\nwhen **things** **depart**, it is called **death**.\n**Life** is the **sprouting** of **spring**,\n**death** is the **falling** of **autumn**.\nMan’s **life** is **one qi** **gathered**,\nand man’s **death** is **one qi** **dispersed**—\nthus, **things** and **man** **arrive and depart**, **live and die**, **never ceasing**.\n\nThis is the **principle** of the Dao/Way **manifesting** thus.\n**Rise and fall** of **all things**,\n**birth and death** of **man**—\nyet these are the **inevitable** **principles** of **Heaven and Earth**, **yin and yang**.\n\n**Life and death** **alternate and transform**—\nthe **common** and **sage** **both know** this,\nso **not** **obscuring** the **soul’s origin**,\n**following** **things’ shifts**,\none **aligns** with the **Emperor of the Forms**,\nand **who** could **compare** to the **son of the Xiè clan**?\n\nIndeed, the **constancy** of **life and death**,\nlike **sleep and wakefulness**,\nhas **always existed** from antiquity.\n\n**Enriching the state** and **settling the people**—\n**applying** the **principles of the Dao/Way**.\n\nTo **enrich the state** is to **provide for the body**,\nto **settle the people** is to **restrain desires**.\n\nHeaven and Earth **are thieves** of **all things**,\n**all things are thieves** of **man**,\nand **man is a thief** of **all things**.\nWhen the **three thefts** **are apt**,\nthen the **Three Powers** **are settled**.\n\nHeaven and Earth **nurture** **all things**,\nsometimes **giving life**, sometimes **taking life**;\n**all things** **steal** from Heaven and Earth,\nyet **neither give nor take life**;\n**man steals** from **all things**,\nyet **both gives and takes life**.\n\nMan **steals** from **all things** to **provide sustenance**—\nthis is how **Heaven, Earth, and man** **successively exchange** and **complete** one another.\nThe **Three Powers** **are** **cyclical harmony**.\n\nThus, Heaven, Earth, **all things**, and man **together** **bring forth** **changes**,\nand it is said:\n*The three thefts, if apt,*\n*then the Three Powers are settled.*\n\nThus it is said:\n*Eat in season,*\n*and the hundred limbs **are in order**.*\n*Trigger the resonance,*\n*and the ten thousand changes **are settled**.*\n\n*To eat* is to **receive qi**,\nand *resonance* is **Heaven’s times** and **Earth’s advantages**.\nIf **eating** **loses** its **season**,\nthen the **hundred limbs** **fall ill**.\nIf **resonance** is **light** in **affairs**,\nthen **speech** **will** **be perilous**.\n\nThe *ten thousand changes* are the *ten thousand states*.\nIf the **ruler** **is clear**,\nthen the *ten thousand states* **are settled**,\nand if **man’s heart** **is harmonious**,\nthen **all ties** **cease**.\n\nIndeed, the **Dao of nourishing life** and the **principles of governance**,\n**are one and the same**.\nMan **knows** his **spirit** and thus **is spirit**,\nbut **does not know** what **is not spirit** and thus **is spirit**.\nThe **spirit** **is** **marvelous** and **boundless**—\nman **cannot** **know** what it **does**.\n\nIt **is spirit** while **man does not know** that it **is spirit**—\nthen **man** and **spirit** **are** **presence and absence**.\nMan **has** presence and **absence**,\nand **spirit** **has absence** yet **presence**—\npresence and absence **without presence**,\nthis is **man** and **spirit** **sharing** the **total emergence** from the **heart’s depths**.\n\n**Submerge** in **Heaven** and **Heaven** **responds**,\n**submerge** in **Earth** and **Earth** **responds**—\nonly the **heart’s spirit** **can** **do** this.\n\nWhen **sincerity** **reaches its utmost**,\nthe **spirit** **is moved** by man,\nthus the **spirit** **is boundless**.\nIt **responds** in **things** and **things respond**,\nand in **man** and **man responds**—\n**embodying** all **ten thousand dharmas**,\n**present everywhere**,\n**eyes witness** and the **Dao/Way** **remains**—\nthis is the **work** of the **spirit**.」\n\nThe sun and moon have their measures, the great and small have their fixed limits.\nFrom this, the **saint’s** virtue arises, and the **divine clarity** emerges.\nThe sun is the accumulation of the moon,\nthe moon is the accumulation of the year—\ntwelve months form a year.\nWhen days exhaust their sequence,\nand months exhaust their cycles,\nthree hundred sixty days are fixed as a complete year.\nSometimes, the great and small are adjusted\nto balance the waxing and waning of yin and yang,\nthus every five years, an intercalary month is added twice\nto supplement the deficiencies of the celestial cycle.\nHence, the **saint’s** virtue and **divine clarity** arise from this,\nand hence they emerge.\nThus, among men, there are distinctions of noble and base, wise and foolish,\nyet only those who attain the **Dao/Way** can escape the **cycle of *jiǎzǐ*** [1].\nThe **cycle of *jiǎzǐ*** is the grand tally of Heaven and Earth,\nwhere the **saint’s** virtue is molded,\nand **divine clarity** is cast.\nThe sequence governs all living things,\nmaking rulers and subjects, fathers and sons, husbands and wives,\nand all things return to their proper order.\nIt is said that every thousand years, a **sage** is born,\nand every five hundred years, a worthy one appears—\nhow could this not depend on the molding of the **divine** and the casting of the **saintly**?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* states:\n*\"Heaven and Earth produce the noble man,\nand the noble man governs Heaven and Earth.\"*\nThose who discuss the **Dao/Way** and govern the state,\nharmonizing yin and yang—\nthis is not something mere mortals can achieve;\nit is the work of the **saint’s** virtue and **divine clarity**.\n\nAs for seizing the **opportunity** [*jī*],\nno one in the world can see it,\nno one can know it.\nThe noble man, when he attains it, preserves himself;\nthe petty man, when he attains it, risks his life.\nThe **opportunity** is the shift between gain and loss.\nIt governs whether Heaven and Earth, all things, and men\nthrive or decline, rise or fall, suffer loss or gain,\nwhat is permissible or forbidden, flourishing or decay—\nall are variations of the **opportunity**.\nThus, to seize the **opportunity** is to usurp the workings of creation in one’s breast,\nto pluck the cosmos into one’s palm.\nHence, those whose deeds are beyond measure yet succeed—\nit is the **opportunity** that makes it so.\n\nAbove, it fulfills the **sovereign’s** duties;\nin the middle, it upholds the **minister’s** path;\nbelow, it governs the **family’s** discipline.\nApplied to the Three Powers [*sān cái*],\nit brings all to fruition.\n\nThe grand aligns with Heaven and Earth’s vastness,\nthe minute divides like the finest hair—\nneither stagnant nor tranquil,\nneither murky nor luminous—\nwhat is called *\"grinding without dulling,\ndying without staining\"*—\nthis is the subtlety of the **opportunity**.\n\nThus, the world’s things have forms that can be observed,\nand men can see them.\nBut the **opportunity**’s thief leaves no trace—\nthe masses cannot perceive it.\nHence, if the **opportunity**’s work is not kept secret, disaster follows.\n\nThe noble man preserves himself by attaining the **opportunity**;\nthe petty man risks his life by losing it.\nThe vulgar masses, blinded by their nature,\ndo not know the use of seizing the **opportunity**—\nthus, the preservation of life and the risking of it\nare made manifest between the noble and the petty.\n\n---\n**Chapter on Strong Arms and Victorious Strategy**\nWarfare is the foundation of the state—\nit can be made strong, but not weak.\nTo fight and win is to overcome the enemy.\nThe ruler wields the awe of the three armies,\nyet does not use them to pacify the world.\nEstablishing the foundation of eternal peace\ndepends on the strength of the arms.\nWhen the arms can meet the enemy and win,\nthese are the state’s arms.\nBut the arms of men are otherwise.\n\nLaozi said that the finest arms are\nan inauspicious instrument.\nNot the tool of the noble,\nthey are used only when there is no alternative,\nwith serenity as the highest principle.\nThe **opportunity** in warfare lies in victory without glory.\nBut to glory in it is to delight in killing,\nand such cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world—\nthis is the folly of men’s arms in underestimating the enemy.\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly loses one’s treasure,\nand failing to wage war properly loses the true source—\nafter great campaigns, there will surely be years of calamity.\n\nThe *Huángtíng Nèijǐng* says:\n*\"Long life requires utmost caution in the chamber’s arts—\nhow can one die and make the spirit weep?\nThis **Dao/Way** is the thief of life,\nonly the Yellow Emperor and Lao Peng mastered it well.\"*\n\nWhen the **body-army** faces the battlefield,\nthe general must be steady—\nthus, speak in terms of funeral rites,\ngovern with the **Dao/Way**,\nand words can be controlled.\nPrevent disorder before it arises,\nand safeguard the state before it is in peril.\nAfter battle, the *yin-demons* are subdued,\nand treasures fill the hall—\nyet it is said:\n*\"Gold and jade fill the hall,\nbut none can guard them.\"*\nThose who embody the **Dao/Way**—\ntheir **body-army** is within themselves,\nand this should be known.\n\nThe blind excel in hearing,\nthe deaf excel in seeing.\nCutting off one source of gain,\nthe army’s strength is tenfold;\nthreefold reflection on day and night,\nthe army’s strength is ten thousandfold.\nThough the blind and deaf lack full hearing and sight,\nthey do not listen with their ears nor see with their eyes—\nthey listen inwardly with the heart,\nand their spirit is singularly focused.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Cut off one source of gain,\nand the strength becomes tenfold;\nif further reflected upon,\nit can rival ten thousandfold.\"*\n\nNow, men possess all six senses,\nten faculties complete—\nyet even with sight and hearing,\nthey cannot fully preserve their ears and eyes,\nnor match the blind and deaf in true focus.\nThe **army** is the multitude.\nThough men have full ears and eyes,\nthey all lose themselves to external sight and sound.\nAre those people deficient in ears and eyes, like the blind and deaf?\nOr do they, through inner attainment, forget ears and eyes,\nand thus truly see and hear?\n\nHence, the **Perfect Man**’s heart is like a mirror—\nclear and untainted by external dust,\nreceptive yet without attachment.\nThe heart is born from things,\ndies from things—\nthe **opportunity** lies in the eyes.\nTo govern the five senses from the empty center—\nthis is the heart.\nOnly the heart is the source of all dharmas.\nThe time of life is not as precious as the time before birth—\nwhy?\nThose who live are enslaved by the heart,\ndriven to move at the sight of gain,\nto ponder at the sight of fame,\nto compete for wealth,\nto lust at the sight of beauty—\nall are things ensnaring the heart,\npreventing the fulfillment of one’s true potential,\nand leading to untimely death.\nFrom this, it is seen:\nman’s life and death are determined by the heart,\nyet before birth, there was none of this.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Fill the belly, not the eyes—\nmake inner observation replace outer vision,\nand prevent external stimuli from disturbing the heart.\"*\nWhen one attains the **Law** and becomes a **sage**,\nawakens to the **Dao/Way** and becomes true—\nhow could one reach or awaken without abandoning the heart?\nThe **opportunity** lies in the eyes,\nfor the heart, dwelling within, responds to the external world.\n\nThe heavens bestow no favor yet great favor arises.\nThe **Celestial Globe** (璇玑) and **Heavenly Motion** (斡运) unfold,\nthe **Dao/Way** (大道) is **originally empty** (元虚),\nyet no single thing is added to its favor—\nit is favor itself.\n\nThus, all things **spontaneously transform** (職職),\narising from **non-action** (無為).\nThe **root of favor** (植而恩者) is the **function of transformation** (化物之功).\nWhen things bear fruit,\nit is through the **order of the Dao/Way** (大道之序),\nfor what need does heaven speak?\n\nThe four seasons proceed,\nten thousand things flourish—\nthis is so.\nSwift thunder and fierce winds,\nnone dare disobey.\n\nSwift thunder and fierce winds,\nthe **mighty force** (威) of the **heavenly spirits** (天神)\nshakes and startles the reckless,\ncommanding them to follow its **decree** (令) above,\nso that chaos dares not act below.\n\nMoreover, when one practices **virtue/power** (作德),\nthe heart finds **ease** (逸) and **rest** (休).\nDaily **artifice** (作伪) brings **labor** (劳),\nand daily **labor** brings **clumsiness** (拙).\nIf one hears the thunder’s voice,\nthe artful cannot help but **brace their chest** (介臆),\nwhile the virtuous remain **unperturbed** (坦然) and **carefree** (无虑).\nThus, the movement of thunder and wind\nstrikes fear in all—\nsave the **easeful** (至静).\n\nAt the onset of sound,\neven the **coagulated and sentient** (含灵)\nall **awaken and transform** (蠢动苏变).\n**Supreme joy** (至乐) is **excess of nature** (性余),\n**supreme stillness** (至静) then **refines** (廉).\nNature (性) is the heart’s birth,\nexcess of nature is **supreme joy** (至乐);\nstillness (静) is the root of nature,\n**supreme stillness** (至静) then **manifests refinement** (行廉).\n\nTo **release without grasping** (放之而不执)\nis to **avoid attachment** (无着) to things in **movement and stillness** (动静),\nlest they harm one’s **life** (生).\nWhat is truly **precious** (贵) in man\nlies in **supreme refinement** (至廉),\nnot in **supreme joy** (至乐).\n\nThus, **supreme joy** (至乐) is **divine** (神);\n**clearing and stillness** (清静),\nas the **foundation for receiving the Dao/Way** (受道之本),\nare the **proper use of the Dao/Way** (正道之用) for all under heaven.\n\nThe heavens’ **ultimate particularity** (至私) serves **ultimate universality** (至公).\nThe **Dao/Way of heaven** (天道) is distant yet **ultimately particular**,\nso things can **be contained** (可容);\nthe **Dao/Way of man** (人道) is near yet **ultimately universal**,\nso things cannot **escape** (无逃).\nWhat can be contained is only what the heavens do,\nwhat cannot escape is what **universality governs** (公之所理).\n\nIn summary,\n**ultimate particularity** and **ultimate universality** exist within the **span of a hand** (反掌之间乎)?\nIf **released into the Dao/Way** (放之於道),\nthen the heavens’ **particularity can be transgressed** (可违);\nif **applied to man** (使之於人),\nonly **universality cannot be sheltered** (不可庇).\nWhy so?\n\nThe **Dao/Way** employs **goodness** (善) in its **use** (用),\nthus **completing its particularity** (成其私);\n**universality** governs with **rectification** (册),\nthus **nothing can be avoided** (不可避).\nIf **ultimate universality** (至公) is not **applied to the people** (加於民),\nthen the **Dao/Way of man** (人道) is **incomplete** (阙矣);\nif **ultimate particularity** (至私) is not **contained within the heavens** (容於天),\nthen the **principles of things** (物理) are **incomplete** (阙矣).\nThe **Dao/Way’s use of particularity and universality** (公私之用),\nthis is the **teaching of good and evil** (善恶之教化).\nThus, the ruler attains it and **fulfills the ruler’s Dao/Way** (尽君道),\nthe subject attains it and **fulfills the subject’s Dao/Way** (尽臣道),\nonly then can one **shift customs and ease mores** (移风易俗).\n\nThe **scholar of governance** (治道之士) attains it—\n**particularity can be maneuvered within the heart** (私可以运于心者),\nthis is called **\"yielding brings completeness\"** (曲则全).\n\nThe **method of beasts** (禽之制) lies in **qi** (炁).\nTwo feet and feathers—this is called **beast** (禽).\nThe **beast** (禽),\nits heart is the **Vermilion Bird** (朱雀).\nWhen man possesses **qi** (炁),\n**joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure** (喜怒哀乐)\nand **taking and discarding** (取舍) control him,\nall are things the heart **cannot properly govern** (善制).\nWhen **qi** aligns with **yang** (毗於阳), there is **joy** (喜);\nwhen **qi** aligns with **yin** (毗於阴), there is **anger** (怒).\nIf one tests this theory,\ncan **qi** truly be **governed** (制)?\n**Qi** (炁) is what it **adapts to** (所适),\nthe **steed of good and evil** (善恶之马),\nor some say the **steed of intention** (意马)—\nthese are all **useless applications** (无之用).\nOnly the **heart’s movement** (心之运) is real,\nso the **scholar of harmonizing qi** (善炁之士),\nhaving **subdued and tamed the heart** (调伏心),\ncan **know** (可知) it.\n\nThus, the **method of governing qi and nourishing the heart** (治炁养心之道) is attained.\nWhen **joy and anger do not alter one’s bearing** (容),\nand **prosperity and decline do not change one’s conduct** (操),\nthen one’s **sovereignty is firmly established** (主宰已定).\nWho then can **defame or praise** (毁誉)?\nNot following things’ shifts,\nthis is **ultimate governance of emotions** (制情之至).\n\n**Life** (生) is the **root of death** (死之根),\n**death** (死) is the **root of life** (生之根).\n**Birth and death** (生死) in man,\nlike **day and night ceasing not** (昼夜不息).\nThis **life** (生) is the **foundation of death** (死之本),\nfor **having life means death** (有生必死);\n**death** (死) is also the **foundation of life** (生之本),\nfor once **death is gone** (既去),\n**life must return** (必又生).\nThus, in **emergence and disappearance** (出没),\n**drowned in the Six Realms** (溺於六道),\nhow could there not be **birth without birth and death without death** (生生不死死)?\n**Birth and death** (死生) truly have **discourse** (议)?\nNo—\nthe **ancient sages** (古圣人) cast them **beyond the Six Extremes** (六合之外),\ndiscussing them yet **not debating** (论而不议).\n\nNow, the **one who does not birth life nor die death** (不生生者),\n**sheds this form and body** (脱此形骸),\nattains the **Dao/Way and becomes true** (得道成真),\n**silently abides in the numinous source** (寂然灵源),\nuniting with the **emptiness** (虚空).\nThey **verify non-action** (证入无为),\n**exit the Three Realms** (出三界外),\nand **rank with all the true ones** (与诸真列位).\nWhat **life** (生) then remains?\n\nOnce **born, death is certain** (既生必死),\nyet the **one who does not die death** (不死死),\nfollows the **nature of freedom** (逍遥之性),\n**receives the essence of the dark and obscure** (纳沆瀣之精),\n**absorbs wind and drinks dew** (吸风饮露),\n**avoids grains to nourish the mists** (辟谷养霞),\n**fortifies and perfects the colored body** (坚固色身),\n**accumulates three thousand labors** (积三千功),\n**and amasses eight hundred deeds** (累八百行).\nWhen **labor is complete and deeds are fulfilled** (功成行满),\none day, with **light exertion** (轻举),\n**flies to the Great Void** (飞游大罗),\nand **gathers with true immortals** (与真仙会).\nThis **colored body departs** (色身而去),\nwhat **death** (死) then remains?\n\n**Death must bring life** (死必有生),\nthis is the **endless cycle** (有无休止).\nLaozi said:\n*\"I have a great affliction—\nmy having a body* (吾有大患，为吾、有身).\nWhen I have no body,\nwhat affliction then remains?\nThis is to say—\n**not to birth life nor die death** (不生生而不死死).*\nThe **Dao/Way of man** (人之道) is otherwise,\nfor it does not **exit the path of birth and death** (出生死之路),\nthus **leading to transmigration** (轮回).\n\n**Favor arises from harm** (恩生於害),\n**harm arises from favor** (害生於恩).\nTo **give to others is favor** (施人曰恩),\nto **injure others is harm** (残人曰害)—\nthis is the **reversal of favor and harm** (恩害颠倒).\nThose who **follow the Dao/Way** (任道之人),\nfirst **labor their sinews and bones** (劳其筋骨),\n**wither their nature** (枯槁其性),\n**make movement their stillness** (以动为静),\n**use obscurity to attain clarity** (用晦而明)—\nthis is but **one step removed from the Dao/Way** (去道则一间).\n\nThus, those who **long dwell in seclusion** (久寓寂寞)\nand **ascend to the sage’s threshold** (身登圣人之阃域),\nthis is **harm birthing favor** (是害生恩);\n**favor arising from harm** (恩生於害),\nspeaks of when man is in **wealth and honor** (富贵之际),\n**indulges his actions** (纵其所为),\n**follows his desires** (因其所欲),\nyet **does not cultivate the self** (而不知修身).\nOnce the **body is shed** (身既脱去),\nthe **sage’s spirit** (神圣) is not **taken along** (与提挈),\n**scattering into all paths** (散人诸趣)—\ncan it not be **injurious** (可不伤乎)?\nThus, the **two paths of favor and harm** (恩害二途)\nare **not to be overlooked** (不可不察).\n\nThe **foolish** (愚人) regard **heaven and earth’s patterns and principles** (天地文理) as **sagehood** (圣),\nI regard **time and things’ patterns and principles** (时物文理) as **wisdom** (哲).\nThose **blocked by ignorance** (茅塞之徒),\n**stumbling and bewildered** (倥侗颛蒙),\nwith **unopened insight** (聪明不开),\nare called **foolish** (愚).\nThe **nature of the foolish** (愚人之性),\ndoes not **broadly embrace things** (博物),\ndoes not **know the Dao/Way** (知道),\ndoes not **follow instruction** (不率教).\nThey say, *\"What are heaven and earth?* (天地何物也？)\n*What are their patterns and principles?* (文理何道也？)\nThus, they **see the sage as foolish** (见之为圣),\nyet **know not why** (则罔知于何故).\"\n\n「I regard those who grasp the patterns and principles of time and things as wise—\nfor this is the wisdom of knowing others.\nMoreover, wisdom is intelligence.\nOnce one knows others, one can know oneself.\nWhen one knows oneself, one may broadly embrace things and elucidate the Dao/Way,\ndetermine what is true and false—\nthis is the application of intelligence.\n\nAll stratagems and schemes lie within it;\nwhether one seeks wealth and honor or longevity, one attains them.\nThus, the patterns and principles of time and things are all within my grasp,\nunder my control—\nwhat mastery of the Dao/Way!\n\nTo seize their patterns and principles as wisdom,\nthis is the fullness of virtue and power.\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Yīn Fú* expounds upon this—\nthis is what the *Yellow Emperor* recorded.\n\nYet the *Yīn Fú* is concise in words yet profound in meaning,\nits significance deep and its principles abyssal.\nFollowing its intent and elucidating its teachings,\nI allow later scholars to observe its words,\nand thus its essence may be comprehended beyond half.\n\nThe wise regard the foolish as ignorant,\nI regard the unwise as not truly sage.\nOthers await their virtue to be manifest,\nI await not their sainthood.\n\nThe scholar **with the Dao yet concealing his traces** (有道而晦迹),\nis said to embody the great wisdom of the foolish appearing wise.\nThus, he harmonizes with the interplay of heaven and humanity,\nensuring no discord arises.\n\nThis is the practice of the **Uncarved Block** (混沌氏),\n**nurturing within himself the heart of a sage or wise man** (内蕴贤哲之心),\nwhile outwardly indulging in the paths of the ignorant and vulgar to **evade the world** (遁世),\nbecoming a **useless tree** (不材之木),\nand living out his natural lifespan—\nthis is the vision of the wise.\n\nI do not indulge in foolishness,\nfor this is the *Yellow Emperor’s* words in jest.\nSuch people fear dying without renown,\nso the **Great Alchemist** (大冶) forged his works,\ndescended among the common folk to bestow his spirit,\nmaking them **sage or wise** (为贤为哲),\nand showering benefits upon the world.\n\nNow, if one abandons the world yet does not seek office,\nis this not truly noble?\n\nAs *Lǎo Zǐ* said:\n*\"When one’s deeds are accomplished, one’s name is secure, and one withdraws—\nthis is the Dao/Way of heaven.\"*\n\nThe sage awaits the **heaven-born sage** (天生圣人),\nto inherit the worthy and assist them.\nAs in the case of **King Gāozōng** (高宗) dreaming of the **Divine Speaker** (说),\nwas it **King Gāozōng** himself?\nOr was it the **Divine Speaker**?\nIt was heaven that made it so! (自天使其然哉)»\n\n「Thus, I do not seek the **heaven-born sage**—\nit is because I embody the **Dao/Way of Nature**,\nletting my desires harmonize with heaven’s **numbers/principles**,\nso I never advance rashly, nor act out of time.\nThus, the **sage or wise** (贤) does not scorn the **foolish** (愚),\nand the **sage** (圣) does not await the **worthy** (物我也).\n\nThis is grasping heaven’s **Dao/Way**,\nso that **yin and yang, ghosts and spirits** (阴阳鬼神) cannot comprehend it.\nPlunge into water, enter fire—\none will bring about one’s own destruction.\n**Yin within yang** is called **fire** (离),\n**yang within yin** is called **water** (坎).\nThus, **fire** is **li** (离),\n**water** is **kan** (坎).\n\nNow, the **Dark Female Gate** (玄牝之门),\nthis is called the **root of heaven and earth** (天地根),\nalso the **principle of human relations** (人伦之纪),\nand the **order of male and female** (男女之序).\nDesire cannot be eradicated—\nit lies in moderation.\nThus, the analogy of **water and fire** (水火之喻)\nis the **union of lead and mercury** (铅汞之合).\nThe **pairing of tiger and dragon** (虎龙之媾),\nif their use is slightly excessive,\nnearly risks losing my **precious essence** (吾宝).\nThe **Dao/Way of Nature** is tranquil,\nso heaven and earth, all things, are born.\nI act without contrivance,\nyet the people transform themselves.\nI love stillness,\nyet the people align themselves.\nThis is the **Dao/Way of Nature** (向然之道).\n\nHeaven and earth—\nthe **parents of all things** (万物之父母).\nThey do not **use life to sustain life** (以生为生),\nhow much more so for all things?\nAll things—\nthe **collective name of those that aid the Dao/Way** (辅道之总名).\nThe **Dao/Way’s essence** (道体) is the **state of Nature** (自然之情状),\nso all things are born from it.\nThe **Dao/Way of heaven and earth** is **pervasive** (浸),\nso **yin and yang** prevail.\nHeaven bestows, earth nurtures—\ntheir benefits are boundless.\nThe **Dao/Way of heaven** is **stillness** (静),\nthe **Dao/Way of earth** is **action** (动).\nWhen **action and stillness** lose their **norms** (常),\n**yin and yang** disrupt their **order** (序).\nNow, even heaven and earth—\nthe most **great and vast** (至大)—\ncannot **overflow** (盈溢),\nhow much more so for humans?\n**Yin and yang** interact, their **transformation and change** (变化) follow **order** (顺).\nThe **two qi** (二炁) of heaven and earth are **yin and yang** (阴阳),\npropagating through all things,\nso their **changes and transformations** (变化)\nare the **cyclical flow of yin and yang** (阴阳之循环).\n\nNow, the **daily shifts** (旦暮之徙),\nthe **advance of hard and soft** (刚柔之行),\nthe **exchange of death and life** (死生代谢),\nthe **alternation of cold and heat** (寒暑迭迁),\nthe **constant motion of all things** (凡物流动),\nare the **ordinary state of humans** (人之常情).\nNo single thing ever **transgresses yin and yang’s degrees and numbers** (出乎阴阳之度数).\nYet, the **six extremes** (六极) are obscure and profound,\nall shaped by its **molding** (陶铸).\n\nTherefore, the **sage** knows\nthat the **Dao/Way of Nature** (自然之道) cannot be **defied** (违).\nHe **conforms to it** (因以制之).\nThe **Dao/Way of Nature** does not **align with ordinary things** (与群物偶),\nso the **sage** knows it cannot be **defied**—\nit is because of its **constant principles** (常数).\n\nThus, humans **follow earth** (法地),\nearth **follows heaven** (法天),\nheaven **follows the Dao/Way** (法道),\nand the **Dao/Way follows Nature** (法自然).\nWho can **transgress the Dao/Way of Nature**?\n\nThe **Dao/Way’s ultimate stillness** (至静之道),\neven **calendrical measurements** (律历) cannot **grasp** (契).\nThe **Dao/Way’s ultimate stillness**,\neven **calendrical measurements** cannot **grasp**—\nthis is its **degrees and principles** (度数).\nHumans are within the **Five Phases’ techniques** (五行术),\nnot **forging their mechanisms** (造其机).\nHow can one **transcend the mundane and attain sainthood** (超凡入圣)?\n\nIf one **reaches the ultimate Dao/Way** (至道),\nhow can **calendrical measurements** (律历) **fathom it** (测)?\n\nThe **Dao/Way of Nature**—\n**emptiness within, substance within** (虚心实腹)—\nonly then can one speak of the **Dao/Way’s borders and limits** (道之涯约).\nIf **mechanical contrivances** (机械) are even slightly present in one’s **chest** (胸中),\nhow distant one is from the **Dao/Way**!\n\nHere is the **strange instrument** (奇器),\nthe **source of all phenomena** (生万象).\nThe **strange instrument**—\nthis is the **substance that receives life** (受生之质).\nThe **Dao/Way** gives it **appearance** (貌),\nheaven gives it **form** (形).\nThus, from the beginning, it has **innate spirit and clarity** (灵明),\nand all phenomena are **complete within one body** (一身备矣).\n\nThe **Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems/Earthly Branches** (八卦甲子),\n**divine mechanisms, hidden by spirits** (神机鬼藏).\nThe **techniques of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming** (阴阳相胜之术)\nare **clearly manifest** (昭昭然) beyond the **trigrams** (象).\n\nThe **Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems/Earthly Branches**—\nthe **divine mechanisms, the spirits’ concealments** (神之机，鬼之藏).\nTheir **uses and applications** (机藏之用)\nare only **mastered by ghosts and spirits** (唯鬼神而能之).\nThus, the **Dao/Way’s role in all transformations** (道之为万化),\nno single thing is **unaccounted for** (无一物而不备),\nno single person is **unfulfilled** (无一人而不全).\n\nThe **Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems/Earthly Branches**—\nthe **mechanisms and strategies of heaven and earth** (天地之机权),\nthe **mysteries of divine and ghostly operations** (神鬼之妙用),\nso **viewing them has no end** (望之无际),\n**applying them has no center** (处之无中),\n**dwelling within them has no fixed place** (居不有方),\n**emerging from them has no defined body** (出而无体).\nThis is the **exhaustive principle of the *Yīnfú* [《阴符》]** (尽理矣).\n\nThose who **repeatedly speak of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming** (阴阳相胜之卫),\nthese are the **machinations that rob life** (贼命之机).\nLater generations’ **clanking and clattering** (籛铿),\nwhat **Yáng Chéngshì** (容成氏) obtained—\nthis is it.\n\n**Clearly manifest** (昭昭) is **bright clarity** (明明).\n**Beyond the trigrams** (进乎象)—\nthis is **great excess** (大过).\nWithin the **trigrams**, the **ninth at the fifth position** (卦中九五),\nthe **meaning of citrus and willow bearing fruit** (桔杨生华之义).\nIf one **understands the trigrams’ subtle changes** (契会卦炁抽添之象),\n**discerns the faintest fluctuations** (消息之微),\n**recognizes the methods of the Cauldron** (鼎器之法),\nand **preserves essence, circulates qi** (保精运炁),\nthen one can **make yin and yang mutually overcome**.\n\nAs *Lǎo Zǐ* said:\n*\"The ancients who were skilled in the Dao/Way of the **gentleman** (士),\nwere **subtle, mysterious, and profound** (微妙玄通),\ndeep and **unfathomable** (深不可识).\nThis is the **essence of the Dao/Way** (要道).\"\n\nThen, **advance and retreat** (进退) are **governed by the lines** (用其爻),\n**action and stillness** are **harmonized with the trigrams** (动静合其卦).\nThus, **li** (离) **gains yang** to **manifest form** (得阳以兆形),\n**kan** (坎) **gains yin** to **complete its body** (得阴以成体).\nThis is called:\n**\"One yin, one yang—the

      "translated_text": "**Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing* Commentary**\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing***\nComposed by **Shi Changchen**, likely from the **Northern Song dynasty**.\nRecorded in *Comprehensive Records of Literature and Arts* (*Tongzhi Yiyong*).\nOne volume.\nSource of the base text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era), **Tongzhen Section (Jewel Precepts Category)**.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Yin Fu Jing* Commentary**\n\nMan is born between Heaven and Earth.\nHis form is bestowed by his parents,\nHis **qi** received from yin and yang,\nAnd his body bears all things.\n\nYet his body aligns with **Dao/Way** in response to phenomena,\nAnd what is profoundly resonant within the human heart\nIs none other than the *Yin Fu Jing*.\n\nIn ancient times, after the death of **Pouxi** (the mythical culinary sage),\n**Shennong** (the Divine Farmer) emerged,\nAnd the Yellow Emperor composed **book-contracts** (written records),\nCommanding **Cangjie** (the legendary inventor of Chinese characters)\nTo observe the forms of birds and beasts,\nThe patterns of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd employ the symbols of all things\nTo create writing—\nThus did the **ghosts and spirits weep**,\nAnd **Dao/Way** first revealed its profound mysteries?\n\n**Dao/Way**, once transformed into **affairs** (practical applications),\nThen into **mechanisms** (strategic principles),\nAnd the deployment of these mechanisms—\nThe highest reveals **moral virtue/power** and governance,\nThe middle offers **techniques for preserving life and body**,\nThe lowest expounds on **conquest and national stability**,\nComprehensive yet without omission.\n\nAt that time,\nThe Yellow Emperor, the **first ancestor of Daoism**,\nDesiring to propagate the **authentic Daoist teachings**,\nReceived from **Yuan Nü** (the Primordial Maiden) over three hundred words,\nAnd further expounded with a hundred more,\nSummarizing the **ultimate principles of all transformations**,\nUniting the **mysteries of all spirits**,\nConcealing the profound and subtle,\nEmbracing Heaven and encompassing Earth—\nIts **precepts are concise**, its **meanings profound**,\nIts **logic deep**, its **principles unfathomable**,\nFor those who attain **self-realization** through **Dao/Way**.\n\nI have examined the commentaries of various scholars,\nYet their interpretations diverge in doctrine,\nTheir explanations rooted in partial perspectives,\nOnly recognizing the *Yin Fu Jing* as the Yellow Emperor’s **authoritative teachings**,\nNot acknowledging **Yuan Nü’s** transmission.\n\nHowever, the *Inner Transmission* records:\nThe Yellow Emperor received from **Yuan Nü** the **essence of the *Yin Fu Jing***,\nMastering the **inner harmony with Heaven’s mechanisms**,\nAnd the **outer alignment with human affairs**—\nThus the **three hundred words** were indeed **Yuan Nü’s** transmission,\nWhile the **hundred words** were the Yellow Emperor’s **elaboration**.\n\nHence, its **language is succinct yet its intent vast**,\nIts **meanings profound**, its **principles deep**—\nObserve its **strange instruments**,\nWhich **generate all phenomena**,\nThe **Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems**,\nThe **divine mechanisms and hidden secrets**—\nThe **art of yin and yang overcoming each other** is clearly revealed beyond mere symbols.\n\nTo comprehend this is to exhaust the *Yin Fu Jing*’s meaning—\nLater generations cannot surpass it.\nWhen **Confucius** lectured on the *Yijing* (I Ching)\nAnd expounded its **appended commentary** (*Shi Ci*),\nThe **Dao/Way of the *Yijing*** was fully elucidated—\nTruly, **books cannot exhaust speech, nor speech exhaust meaning**—\nWhat more can be said?\n\nThus, I boldly **pruned the old commentaries**,\nAnd **composed new annotations**,\nEnsuring **verification and practical application** without error.\n\nMoreover, the **Yellow Old School** (referring to Yellow Emperor and Laozi)\nEstablished its teachings:\n**Dao/Way** values **gathering the void**,\nLofty discourse and sweeping principles,\nDetached from worldly conventions and customs,\nNot enticing the **profane** with superficial explanations,\nBut revealing only the **core insights of the sages**.\n\nThose who **contemplate its intent** grasp its **multifaceted wonders**,\nAnd the **erudite** attain its **subtle profundities**—\nIts **precepts originate from the Three Sovereigns**,\nIts **teachings extend through all ages**,\nEnriching the **strategies of benevolent rulers**,\nSupplying the **tools of virtuous ministers**.\n\nFrom the **Qin and Han dynasties** above,\nTo the **Sui and Tang dynasties** below,\nGenerals and eminent ministers,\nAscetics and **recluse Daoists**,\nThose who annotated and commented on it are innumerable.\n\nNow, the *Yin Fu Jing*’s **application** lies in **Heaven’s mechanisms**—\nIf it **resonates within the heart**,\nHow could it be called a **minor supplement**?\n\n**Shi Changchen** humbly composes this preface.\n\n---\n\n**The *Yin Fu Jing*’s Historical Account**\n\nIn ancient times, the **Western Queen Mother** descended upon **Wangwu Mountain**,\nGranting the Yellow Emperor **martial arts**,\nAnd he **defeated Chi You** in the **Zhuolu wilderness**,\nExterminating **demonic chaos**,\nEliminating **heavenly calamities**.\n\nThen he **governed the states and clans**,\nEstablished **shrines and ancestral altars**,\nAllotted **lands and territories**,\nAnd appointed **feudal lords**—\nThe **Five Phases** (elements) were fixed,\nAnd **great bandits** were eradicated.\n\nThe Queen Mother sent **Yuan Nü** again\nTo transmit the Yellow Emperor **secret precepts**—\nNineteen chapters of the *Inner Transmission*,\nAnd the *Yin Fu Jing*’s **three hundred words**—\nIncluding **alchemical formulas for gold elixirs and jade seals**,\n**Talismans that soar through the void**,\n**Methods of traversing fire and walking on water**—\nAll were fully encompassed.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor then **established the Bureau of Welcoming Immortals**,\n**Refined the essentials of ascension**,\nAnd **revealed sacred texts and secret scriptures**\nTo broaden **Daoist teachings**—\nThus all within the **Six Realms** (Heaven, Earth, and the four directions)\nWere **beneficially guided**.\n\nFrom **Dongting Lake**, he **rode a fire dragon** and ascended,\nHis **sword and sandals buried** by his ministers at **Bashan Mountain**—\nThe records clearly attest to this.\n\nThis **scripture** was transmitted to posterity,\nSo that later ages might **embody and practice** it—\nThus the **benevolent** see it as **benevolence**,\nAnd the **wise** see it as **wisdom**.\n\nThose who **awaken to its truths**,\nGenerally grasp the **sequential principles of Dao/Way and techniques**\nTo **manifest virtue and conceal practical applications**;\nThose who **peruse its logic**,\nAttain **self-realization** through **Dao/Way**.\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing***\n\n**Shi Changchen**, **Deputy Keeper of the Jianlong Daoist Observatory**,\nAnd **Purple-Robed Master of Preservation and Peace**,\nNow elucidates the *Yin Fu Jing*:\n\n**Chapter on the Embracing of One by Immortals and Daoists**\n*\"Preserve essence and safeguard **qi**—\nThe **spirit** then abides.\nTo attain **Dao/Way** and not die—\nThis is called **ascension (xian)**.\"*\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way of immortals and Daoists**\nResonates with humanity like **valley spirits**,\nAs **Laozi** described: *\"Valley spirits do not die.\"*\n\nWhat man **preserves** is his **spirit**,\nWhat he **encounters** is **transformation**—\nTo **embrace One** means all things\n**Carry yin while embracing yang**,\nHence it is called *\"**Dao/Way** generates One.\"*\n\nThough **numbers** extend to **ten thousand billions**,\nThey all **originate from One**—\nThis chapter seeks to **broadly transmit and comprehensively elucidate**\nLike a **moon reflected in water**,\n**Manifesting without fail.**\n\nThus, it is **marked as the first chapter**.\n\n**To observe Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,\nAnd to **grasp Heaven’s actions**—\nThis is exhaustive.**\n\nHeaven’s **Dao/Way** flows and **accumulates nowhere**,\nThus all things **generate**.\nHence, **phenomena have forms** that can be observed,\n**Dao/Way is formless** yet can be **attained**—\nIf **phenomena** are **self-perceived**,\nThen to **know Heaven’s actions**,\nSilently **respond to transformation**—\nThis is to **grasp Heaven’s actions**.\n\n**Actions** refer to the **unfixed states**,\nThus **Dao/Way’s** **cyclical rotation** like a **hinge**—\nOnly when one **finds its center**,\nDoes one **achieve its boundlessness**;\n**Heaven** is **vast and complete**,\nEncompassing all spirits,\n**Guarding through emptiness**,\n**Rooting in tranquility**—\nIf man’s heart is **like the Great Emptiness**,\nAnd **touches phenomena in alignment with **Dao/Way**,\nUnobstructed by **material fixation**,\nAnd **unmoved**—\nThen **phenomena** will **respond without fail**,\nAnd **self and phenomena** will **both be forgotten**—\nThus one **attains the profound mysteries**.\"",

      "translated_text": "「Thus, one who possesses the innate quality to receive the **Dao/Way**,\nShall have **no intent**, **no fixed certainty**, **no rigidity**, **no self**—\nWhen **actions** align with **divine resonance**,\nLeft and right, one finds its source—\nThis is how the **Sage** achieves **non-action** yet **nothing left undone**.\n\nFor indeed, such a one **fully** and **exhaustively** grasps it.\nFrom this perspective,\nThe **observer** observes with the **heart**, not with the **eyes**,\nThe **holder** grasps with the **heart**, not with the **hands**—\n**Without observation or fixation**,\n**Heaven’s actions** are **attained**.\n\n**Heaven** has five **thieves**—\nThose who recognize them flourish.\nThe principles of **things** are:\n**Thieves of merit** (功),\n**Thieves of skill** (巧),\n**Thieves of timing** (時),\n**Thieves of substance** (物),\n**Thieves of life** (命)—\nAll are **Heaven’s** doing,\nNot what man can **force**.\n\nYet **Great Yu** stole **merit**,\n**Gongshu Ban** stole **skill**,\n**Confucius** stole **timing**,\n**Fan Li** stole **substance**,\n**Laozi and Pengzu** stole **life**—\nThus the **thieves** are **takers**.\nThese five masters **understood Heaven’s resonance**,\nAnd thus they became **Internal Saints and Outer Kings**.\n\nThe five **thieves**—\nMetaphorically speaking,\nIn **Heaven** they are the **Five Stars**,\nOn earth they are the **Five Sacred Mountains**,\nIn man they are the **Five Zang Organs**—\nBroadly considered,\nTheir methods **internalized**,\nIn **Dao** are called **Xian** (仙),\nIn **Confucianism** are called **Yuan** (元).\nTaking from afar,\nThey are **external things**;\nTaking from near,\nThey are **internal desires**.\nThe **central master** of **internal desires**,\nThe **heart** enslaved

**sovereign ruler**,\nAnd one **does not follow things**,\nThen the metaphor of the five **thieves** applies to the **immediate world**—\nThe **heart** perceives them,\nAnd they lie **within one’s grasp**—\nIf one **uses them well**, they become the **Five Powers** (五德),\nIf one **uses them poorly**, they become the **Five Thieves**—\nThus one **flourishes**.\n\nThe five **thieves** dwell in the **heart**,\nYet their **manifestations** extend to **Heaven**—\nTheir **functions** are **applied** across **Heaven, Earth, and Man**,\nYet they **never cease** to be present,\nOnly **restrained by the heart**—\nThus **Dao/Way** is in **things**,\nThe **heart** is in the **body**—\n**Dao/Way** does not **follow things**,\nThe **heart** does not **move with the body**,\nThen it is **firmly unshakable**.\n\nSuch are those with **Dao/Way**,\nWho **govern before chaos arises**,\nAnd **preserve the realm before peril comes**.\n\nOne **resonance** moves, and a hundred **spirits** follow—\nIs **Heaven** so distant?\nHow **profound** is it?\nThe **heart’s** reach, when **perceiving resonance**,\n**Aligns with Heaven**—\nWhat **distance** is there, then?\n\nThis is how the **heart’s**

**cosmos** lies within the **hand**.\n\nThe **Immortal** also said:\n*\"There are those who perceive the **resonance of Creation** (造化机),\nWith their **hands** they **grasp** the **sun and moon**,\nStable as **furnaces** within their **bodies**—\nLike **knocking on a mystical door**,\n**Relying on the artisan’s skill**—\nThis speaks of **profound mysteries**, beyond **explicit

**abhors**.\nMan’s nature—\n**To love life and hate death**,\n**To seek benefit and avoid harm**—\nAll are **bestowed by Heaven**.\n\nAs when man **pursues a principle**,\n**Awakens to a method**,\n**Completes a matter**—\nIt is through **practice** that they **attain** it.\nThus **Heaven’s** **endowment** of nature,\n**No one attains without seeking**—\nThe **heart** holds **far-reaching aspirations**,\n**Cultivating the body** to **achieve** them.\n\nThe **vulgar** call this **delusive thinking** (妄想),\nYet they **do not know** that **delusive thinking** is the **ladder** to **Dao/Way**—\nThus **Heaven’s** nature is **made by man**,\nAnd the **human heart** is **driven by resonance**—\nWhen man **dwells in stillness**, it is the **heart**,\nWhen man **moves**, it is the **resonance**—\nHow much more so when **Heaven’s resonance** is **triggered**,\nAnd one can **sit and advance** into this **Dao/Way**,\nHow can it be **compared** to those who **merely prattle**?\n\nThus the **nature of man** is **known**.\n\n**Establish Heaven’s Dao/Way**,\nTo **settle humanity**—\n**Heaven’s Dao/Way** is **still** while **humanity’s Dao/Way** is **active**,\n**Active** aligns with **Yang’s virtue/power**,\n**Still** aligns with **Yin’s essence**—\n**Motionless and tranquil**,\nYet **stirred** and **immediately responsive**—\nThe **Sage** **receives humanity with emptiness**,\nAnd thus can **reflect back**.\n\n**Humanity’s Dao/Way** is **easily moved** yet **hard to still**,\nTo **know its stillness** is to **align with Heaven**—\nAs **Laozi** said:\n*\"Returning to the **root** is called **stillness**,\n**Stillness** is called **restoring life** (复命).\"*\nTo **be settled** then to **respond**,\nIs to **exhaust principles** and **fulfill nature**.\n\nThus **establishing Heaven’s Dao/Way** to **guide humanity**,\nIf man **knows Heaven’s silent operations**,\nThen he can **embody transformation** and **discard worldly filth**,\nThe **heart** like a **clear mirror**,\n**Responsive** without end,\n**Playing with Heaven’s Dao/Way**—\nIn **humanity’s Dao/Way**, what **distance** remains?\n\nWhen **Heaven** **triggers**

otherwise.\n\nLaozi said that the finest arms are\nan inauspicious instrument.\nNot the tool of the noble,\nthey are used only when there is no alternative,\nwith serenity as the highest principle.\nThe **opportunity** in warfare lies in victory without glory.\nBut to glory in it is to delight in killing,\nand such cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world—\nthis is the folly of men’s arms in underestimating the enemy.\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly loses one’s treasure,\nand failing to wage war properly loses the true source—\nafter great campaigns, there will surely be years of calamity.\n\nThe *Huángtíng Nèijǐng* says:\n*\"Long life requires utmost caution in the chamber’s arts—\nhow can one die and make the spirit weep?\nThis **Dao/Way** is the thief of

the sight of beauty—\nall are things ensnaring the heart,\npreventing the fulfillment of one’s true potential,\nand leading to untimely death.\nFrom this, it is seen:\nman’s life and death are

(正道之用) for all under heaven.\n\nThe heavens’ **ultimate particularity** (至私) serves **ultimate universality** (至公).\nThe **Dao/Way of heaven** (天道) is distant yet **ultimately particular**,\nso things

(放之於道),\nthen the heavens’ **particularity can be transgressed** (可违);\nif **applied to man** (使之於人),\nonly **universality cannot be sheltered** (不可庇).\nWhy so?\n\nThe **Dao/Way** employs **goodness**

**principles of things** (物理) are **incomplete** (阙矣).\nThe **Dao/Way’s use of particularity and universality** (公私之用),\nthis is the **teaching of good and evil** (善恶之教化).\nThus, the ruler attains it and **fulfills the ruler’s Dao/Way** (尽君道),\nthe subject attains it and **fulfills the subject’s Dao/Way** (尽臣道),\nonly then can one **shift customs and ease mores** (移风易俗).\n\nThe **scholar of governance** (治道之士) attains it—\n**particularity can be maneuvered within the heart** (私可以运于心者),\nthis is called **\"yielding brings completeness\"** (曲则全).\n\nThe **method of beasts** (禽之制) lies in **qi** (炁).\nTwo feet and feathers—this is called **beast** (禽).\nThe **beast** (禽),\nits heart is the **Vermilion Bird** (朱雀).\nWhen man possesses **qi** (炁),\n**joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure** (喜怒哀乐)\nand **taking and discarding** (取舍) control him,\nall are things the heart **cannot properly govern** (善制).\nWhen **qi** aligns with **yang** (毗於阳), there is **joy** (喜);\nwhen **qi** aligns

**gathers with true immortals** (与真仙会).\nThis **colored body departs** (色身而去),\nwhat **death** (死) then remains?\n\n**Death must bring life** (死必有生),\nthis is the **endless cycle** (有无休止).\nLaozi said:\n*\"I have a great affliction—\nmy having a body* (吾有大患，为吾、有身).\nWhen I have no body,\nwhat affliction then remains?\nThis is to say—\n**not to birth life nor die death** (不生生而不死死).*\nThe **Dao/Way of man** (人之道) is otherwise,\nfor it does not **exit the path of birth and death** (出生死之路),\nthus **leading to transmigration** (轮回).\n\n**Favor arises from harm** (恩生於害),\n**harm arises from favor** (害生於恩).\nTo **give to others is favor** (施人曰恩),\nto **injure others is harm** (残人曰害)—\nthis is the **reversal of favor and harm** (恩害颠倒).\nThose who **follow the Dao/Way** (任道之人),\nfirst **labor their sinews and bones** (劳其筋骨),\n**wither their nature** (枯槁其性),\n**make movement their stillness** (以动为静),\n**use obscurity to attain clarity** (用晦而明)—\nthis is but **one step removed from

(恩生於害),\nspeaks of when man is in **wealth and honor** (富贵之际),\n**indulges his actions** (纵其所为),\n**follows his desires** (因其所欲),\nyet **does not cultivate the self** (而不知修身).\nOnce the **body is shed** (身既脱去),\nthe **sage’s spirit** (神圣) is not **taken along** (与提挈),\n**scattering into all paths** (散人诸趣)—\ncan it not be **injurious** (可不伤乎)?\nThus, the **two paths of favor and harm**

(法天),\nheaven **follows the Dao/Way** (法道),\nand the **Dao/Way follows Nature** (法自然).\nWho can **transgress the Dao/Way of Nature**?\n\nThe **Dao/Way’s ultimate stillness** (至静之道),\neven **calendrical measurements** (律历) cannot **grasp** (契).\nThe **Dao/Way’s ultimate stillness**,\neven **calendrical measurements** cannot **grasp**—\nthis is its **degrees and principles** (度数).\nHumans are within the **Five Phases’ techniques** (五行术),\nnot **forging their mechanisms** (造其机).\nHow can one **transcend the mundane and attain sainthood** (超凡入圣)?\n\nIf one **reaches the ultimate Dao/Way** (至道),\nhow can **calendrical measurements** (律历) **fathom it** (测)?\n\nThe **Dao/Way of Nature**—\n**emptiness within, substance within** (虚心实腹)—\nonly then can one speak of the **Dao/Way’s borders and limits** (道之涯约).\nIf **mechanical contrivances** (机械) are even slightly present in one’s **chest** (胸中),\nhow distant one is from the **Dao/Way**!\n\nHere is the **strange instrument** (奇器),\nthe **source of all phenomena** (生万象).\nThe **strange instrument**—\nthis is the **substance that receives life** (受生之质).\nThe **Dao/Way** gives it **appearance** (貌),\nheaven gives it **form** (形).\nThus, from the beginning, it has **innate spirit and clarity** (灵明),\nand all phenomena are **complete within one body** (一身备矣).\n\nThe **Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems/Earthly Branches** (八卦甲子),\n**divine mechanisms, hidden by spirits** (神机鬼藏).\nThe **techniques of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming** (阴阳相胜之术)\nare **clearly manifest** (昭昭然) beyond the **trigrams** (象).\n\nThe **Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems/Earthly Branches**—\nthe **divine mechanisms, the spirits’ concealments** (神之机，鬼之藏).\nTheir **uses and applications** (机藏之用)\nare only **mastered by ghosts and spirits** (唯鬼神而能之).\nThus, the **Dao/Way’s role in all transformations** (道之为万化),\nno single thing is **unaccounted for** (无一物而不备),\nno single person is **unfulfilled** (无一人而不全).\n\nThe **Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems/Earthly Branches**—\nthe **mechanisms and strategies of heaven and earth** (天地之机权),\nthe **mysteries of divine and ghostly operations** (神鬼之妙用),\nso **viewing them has no end** (望之无际),\n**applying them has no center** (处之无中),\n**dwelling within them has no fixed place** (居不有方),\n**emerging from them has no defined body** (出而无体).\nThis is the **exhaustive principle of the *Yīnfú* [《阴符》]** (尽理矣).\n\nThose who **repeatedly speak of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming** (阴阳相胜之卫),\nthese are the **machinations that rob life** (贼命之机).\nLater generations’ **clanking and clattering** (籛铿),\nwhat **Yáng Chéngshì** (容成氏) obtained—\nthis is it.\n\n**Clearly manifest** (昭昭) is **bright clarity** (明明).\n**Beyond the trigrams** (进乎象)—\nthis is **great excess** (大过).\nWithin the **trigrams**, the **ninth at the fifth position** (卦中九五),\nthe **meaning of citrus and willow bearing fruit** (桔杨生华之义).\nIf one **understands the trigrams’ subtle changes** (契会卦炁抽添之象),\n**discerns the faintest fluctuations** (消息之微),\n**recognizes the methods of the Cauldron** (鼎器之法),\nand **preserves essence, circulates qi** (保精运炁),\nthen one can **make yin and yang mutually overcome**.\n\nAs *Lǎo Zǐ* said:\n*\"The ancients who were skilled in the Dao/Way of the **gentleman** (士),\nwere **subtle, mysterious, and profound** (微妙玄通),\ndeep and **unfathomable** (深不可识).\nThis is the **essence of the Dao/Way** (要道).\"\n\nThen, **advance and retreat** (进退) are **governed by the lines** (用其爻),\n**action and stillness** are **harmonized with the trigrams** (动静合其卦).\nThus, **li** (离) **gains yang** to **manifest form** (得阳以兆形),\n**kan** (坎) **gains yin** to **complete its body** (得阴以成体).\nThis is called:\n**\"One yin, one yang—the Dao/Way\"** (一阴一阳之谓道).\n\n**Continuation** (继) is **virtue** (善),\n**fulfillment** (成) is **nature** (性).\nThus, the **profound meaning of the *Yīnfú*** (《阴符》妙义),\nwithout the **resources of a High True One or Upper Immortal** (高真上仙之资),\nwho can **attain this**?\n\nThose who **contemplate it** (玩之者)\ncan **know it in the heart** (可以心知),\nyet cannot **speak of it** (不可言告).\nThus, the **common folk use it daily without knowing** (百姓日用而不知).\n\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s* **Yīnfú Classic** (黄帝阴符经) is **complete**.」",
