  "full_translation": "**Preface to the *Returning Elixir and Restoring the Mandate***\n\nAlas! Man possesses a body, yet how long he has remained benighted. Names and profits plunder his heart; right and wrong ravage his will. Day by day, he sinks deeper into meanness and stinginess, unaware of the excellence of the Dao, ever drifting farther from it.\n\nYet the Supreme Dao is not distant—it abides always before our eyes. Thus the immortal scriptures say: *\"The Great Dao flows freely, ever near to left and right.\"* Though there be those who walk the Way, who would reveal its mysteries to others, who would believe them?\n\nMy own crude and reckless words are unworthy of trust. To expound the Way of the Golden Crucible and Returning Elixir to the world is even less fitting. Those who possess the Dao shall know it for themselves.\n\nIn my early years of Daoist study, all I encountered were scholars of principle. Yet if their habitual leaks remained unsealed, they still followed the cycle of birth and death. As for those who \"sit and shed the body\" or \"stand and depart,\" who seize a womb or usurp a vessel—never have I seen one attain sudden and lasting transcendence.\n\nI once reflected that Confucius \"exhausted principle and fulfilled nature to reach destiny,\" while the Old Master ascended and took flight. Thus I knew the intent of the sages could not be grasped by a single path alone.\n\nIn the *gengzi* year of the Xuanhe era, I received oral instructions from a perfected one, who said: *\"The Ancestor of the Great Dao arises from a single qi, which transforms all things. It is likened to the sun and moon, named the Dragon and Tiger, divided into yin and yang, and entrusted to Heaven and Earth. One clear, one turbid—Metal and Wood stand apart at the Gate of *wu* and *ji*. One nature, one emotion—yin and yang converge at the Portal of Life and Death. Gather the qi of the Two Modes before their division; seize the essence of the Dragon and Tiger at their first union. Enter the Yellow Chamber, and there produce the supreme treasure. Beyond this lies the pivot of the Dharma-image and the marvelous workings of return. The secret of longevity is complete herein.\"*\n\nOnly then did I realize the Great Dao is not complex—one must but meet a perfected master, receive their oral instructions, and thus arrive at the true threshold.\n\nFor decades, what I had pursued were but the remnants of the sages. Only now did I grasp the principle that things do not truly change. *\"One yin, one yang—this is the Dao; partial yin or partial yang—this is illness.\"* The mechanism of the Dragon and Tiger, the principle of Metal and Wood—this is the true instruction. I heard it without doubt, practiced it according to the method, and indeed ascended to the realm of the sages.\n\nI have heard that the profound essence is concealed within the Six Classics and the histories. Thus the *Book of Changes* says: *\"When male and female unite their essence, the myriad things are transformed and born.\"* How could it not reveal the subtle workings of the Dao? Yet when one expounds it through the constructs of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—all deliberate action—it appears contrary to the Way of non-action.\n\nFormerly, the scholars of Zou and Lu, the gentry and masters, were largely able to comprehend these truths—yet in recent times, none remain who do. Following the oral instructions of my teacher, I composed sixteen five-character poems to express the measure of \"two eights make one catty.\" Thirty seven-character quatrains correspond to the thirty days of great achievement. Nine additional *Xijiangyue* verses align with the nine-fold cyclical method. Here is made clear the discernment of medicinal substances, their gathering, the generation and destruction of the Five Phases, the sequence of host and guest, the waxing and waning of punitive and virtuous forces, the techniques of extraction and augmentation, and the precise measures of fire-tending—all without omission.\n\nThose who cherish the Dao should study this text closely; some, by virtue of karmic affinity, may naturally encounter its truths. Though the language be coarse, each word speaks only of reality.\n\n*Preface by Xue Daoguang in the autumn of the bingwu year of the Jingkang era.*\n\n**Sixteen Five-Character Regulated Verses**\n\n**I**\nThere exists a thing with numinous form,\nNameless, rooted in the natural.\nThe Crimson Dragon hides in the cosmos,\nThe White Tiger conceals in the Cinnabar Field.\nBeneath the Northern Dipper, southward spread,\nBy brows and lashes’ edge.\nWith ashen heart, practice Water and Fire,\nIn settled breath, seek true Lead.\n\n**II**\nEssence and qi are the primal foundation,\nSpirit and numen share one household.\nSimply capture the Five Thieves,\nAnd naturally coalesce the Three Flowers.\nLet not *jia* and *yi* go astray,\nNor *geng* and *xin* err.\nWhen the solitary yang returns to rightful command,\nThe Seven Returns set the River Chariot in motion.\n\n**III**\nThis matter is truly hard to fathom,\nWise and foolish alike fail to discern.\nThe sparrow is no kin to the phoenix,\nThe horse does not herd with the sheep.\nA special product, just three hundred,\nHeaven and Earth share one catty.\nPatrolling the twelve paths,\nThe barefoot fierce general.\n\n**IV**\nOne, two, three, four, five,\nThe Southern Aster faces the Northern Aster.\nTiger and Dragon cradle azure jade,\nMetal and Wood gestate pearl and treasure.\nClouds disperse, moonlight fills every home,\nFlowers bloom, spring graces every place.\nHow many wanderers beyond the clouds—\nAll are but people of this world.\n\n**V**\nHaving received the true immortal’s formula,\nWithin yin, refine to utmost yang.\nWhere the earth-thunder stirs in concealment,\nThe stars and constellations deliberate together.\nThe Eight Trigrams behold the completed Mother,\nThe Three Powers first witness flourishing.\nNo need to fret over life and death’s entanglements,\nOnly sense the enduring vastness of Earth and Heaven.\n\n**VI**\nYin and yang share one art,\nIts subtlety profound and deeply hidden.\nWith intent, seek *geng* and *jia*,\nWith single mind, serve *bing* the King.\nCapture the Bird and the Hare,\nSeize Water and Metal.\nDiscern the things of east and west,\nAnd cultivate the mind of non-duality.\n\n**VII**\nGraceful and supple in bearing,\nPlayfully tender and soft.\nFrom the heartless strings, take it,\nFrom the earth, gather soul and spirit.\nThe cap-pole unites Lead and Mercury,\nThe numinous light shoots toward Dipper and Ox.\nYouth is most yin and dung—\nLet not old age claim your spring.\n\n**VIII**\nUnrestrained and carefree,\nLofty grows the Dao.\nWithin the wondrous, black and white lie hidden,\nIn leisure, shun the toil of dust.\nSitting or lying, the Three Peaks steady,\nThe Cinnabar Field’s two qi secure.\nKnow surely you escape the world’s snares,\nYour name listed among the immortals’ ranks.\n\n**IX**\nGathering must be done in secrecy,\nWith sincere heart, distinguish ugliness and beauty.\nThe matter is difficult—trace the thread of intent,\nEasy to lose the cold spring.\nThe teacher points to the Azure Dragon’s Mercury,\nTo pair with the White Tiger’s Lead.\nWhen both are united,\nWater and Fire refine for years.\n\n**X**\nGuard the One within the altar’s core,\nThe mechanism hidden in the twelve hours.\nWithin the numbers, let nothing stray,\nIn fire-tending, let no delay occur.\nOnly the enlightened may be your companion,\nTrue immortals are most fitting.\nFor years upon the clouds and waters,\nWho knows the longing in your heart?\n\n**XI**\nHumans possess the most numinous thing,\nVaguely present near the Northern Aster.\nNot knowing, one calls it qi,\nBut recognizing it, it becomes naturally true.\nThe heart still as ice and snow,\nThe body light as azure clouds.\nWithout a thousand myriad years,\nWhy be a person of this world?\n\n**XII**\nIn bustling markets, mingling with people,\nClearly and openly, coming and going.\nAwakened, there is but one thing,\nDeluded, a thousand mountains divide.\nDivine Water lies below the Cinnabar Field,\nThe Flowery Pond between Water and Fire.\nOne primordial force enables creation,\nReturning the old to youthful countenance.\n\n**XIII**\nSkill and clumsiness still lie concealed,\nSpirit and intent envelop all.\nKan and Li mutually employ each other,\nMetal and Wood delight in their union.\nWhite Snow can share the crucible,\nYellow Sprout dwells in one bud.\nHeaven and Earth reckon nine and six,\nFu and Gou move the initial line.\n\n**XIV**\nOne thing divides into two,\nKnow the names of these two.\nThe tripod and furnace hold sun and moon,\nThe drip and the third watch.\nHusband and wife unite in congress,\nThe infant begins to form.\nShedding the womb and bathing,\nNurtured to ensure long life.\n\n**XV**\nHaving consumed the numinous elixir,\nThe purely yang person is at ease.\nLucid and ever still, shining,\nPenglai Isle abides in eternal spring.\nComing and going, utterly unbound,\nWandering freely, beyond all dust.\nSimply know the cycle of *jiazi*,\nNo need to guard *geng* and *xin*.\n\n**XVI**\nSeeking the Dao, pursuing the true,\nRoaming the shores of the four seas.\nOutwardly, endure humiliation with forbearance,\nInwardly, accept hardship and delay.\nWeary of worldly affairs,\nJoyful to meet a guest of the Purple Palace.\nA single word of direct instruction,\nAnd the Jade Grotto’s emerald peach blossoms in spring.\n\n**Thirty Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\n**I**\nAll things arise from one qi,\nHeaven clear, Earth turbid, endowed with life.\nWhen true Dragon and true Tiger first unite,\nIn one crucible, red Lead refines *jia* and *geng*.\n\n**II**\nYin and yang pair as ruler and minister,\nMovement and stillness combine qi, blood, and essence.\nIn the *ren* and *gui* positions, the man strikes the waves,\nBy the *bing* and *ding* crags, the woman frequently moans.\n\n**III**\nDragon and Tiger, once entwined in affection,\nKan and Li, just conjoined, form the embryo.\nA full measure of the marrow of Heaven and Earth,\nWith intent, seek to sip and take it in.\n\n**IV**\nThings gather by kind, groups divide,\nTwo sides share one scale, one catty.\nWithin the *wu* and *ji* palace, Water and Fire lie hidden,\nTend carefully with martial and civil arts.\n\n**V**\nIn the Li Palace, an image conceals true Water,\nAt the Kan Gate, formless, the Crimson Dragon hides.\nWhen the season is right, gather swiftly,\nLest the sprouts overflow the Yellow Palace.\n\n**VI**\nThirty spokes unite in one hub,\nMetal and Wood, when the two qi meet.\nThe sixty-four hexagrams divide morning and evening,\nThe solitary yang sprouts, stirring the initial line.\n\n**VII**\nWithin yin’s thirteen, forms take shape,\nWithin yang’s six and seven, no trace is found.\nIn drawing and adding, exercise utmost care,\nDiscern the root-source, the Ancestor and the Clan.\n\n**VIII**\nAmidst the indistinct, seek the form,\nWithin the boundless dark, find true essence.\nTrue essence is the elixir of long life,\nYet it must be nurtured by the Yellow Dame.\n\n**IX**\nWithin six hundred chapters, scrutinize closely,\nProbe the hidden and the soaring to fathom subtleties.\nFamiliar and distant, intertwined and known,\nSteal the mechanism of the Seven Stars and Southern Dipper.\n\n**X**\nYin cauldron, yang furnace—the root of the supreme Dao,\nFive phases harmonized, with Earth as sovereign.\nIf one seeks the elixir of long life,\nLook only to the Flowery Pond for soul and spirit.\n\n**XI**\nThe sage transmits the medicine, not the fire,\nFor the fire-timing has ever been known by few.\nDo not treat the great Dao as child’s play,\nBut ponder it carefully with the immortals.\n\n**XII**\nFire-timing, drawing and adding—thoughts transcend dust,\nOne line observed, another arises.\nYin’s script and yang’s martial art follow increase and decrease,\nA pellet of returning cinnabar is forged in the fire.\n\n**XIII**\nSwallowing saliva, absorbing qi to secure the body whole,\nOne must rely on Heaven and Earth’s true mercury and lead.\nThe supreme Dao is not complex—people obscure it themselves,\nThe five metals and eight stones are but empty claims.\n\n**XIV**\nThe two qi arise as the child gives birth to the mother,\nSeized in the crucible at the opportune moment.\nHusband’s joy, wife’s union in the golden chamber,\nAfter one year, a child is born of the embryo.\n\n**XV**\nGrasp the wondrous cause of yin and yang,\nRefine the golden liquid to transcend the mortal dust.\nWashing and settling are no ordinary matters,\nThe Crimson Maiden and Infant Boy must both be true.\n\n**XVI**\nDrive back the Northern Dipper, turn the Celestial Stem,\nGrasp the Southern Star and enter the grotto chamber.\nWithin the *Pi* and *Tai* lines, Heaven and Earth unite,\nThe Hare and Rooster bathe—conceal them well.\n\n**XVII**\nIn the Crystal Palace, the green-robed maiden is fair,\nA scene of splendor breaks the solitude.\nSeize the essence and marrow of Hare and Crow,\nHasten to gather and refine them in the crucible.\n\n**XVIII**\nBanish self and other, guard the elixir chamber,\nThen time’s passage and qi’s savor seem long.\nNeither glory nor disgrace follows the guest beyond the dust,\nOnly in the golden crucible is lead frost refined.\n\n**XIX**\nTiger’s marrow, dragon’s essence—qi and image complete,\nCultivate by the method, simmer with fire-timing.\nWait until yin dissolves to form the supreme chamber,\nThen you will know how immortals hide on level ground.\n\n**XX**\nA trifling celestial mechanism speaks of qi and essence,\nMaster Lü once said there is no other truth.\nThe immortals dare not speak plainly,\nFor to speak plainly would invite mockery.\n\n**XXI**\nNine returns, seven reversals determine the Three Powers,\nOpening and closing, drawing and adding all depend on the medium.\nThe Four Symbols converge in *wu* and *ji*,\nWith sincerity, after ten months, an infant is born.\n\n**XXII**\nOf late, my livelihood has grown ever more refined,\nTilling a mu of sandy field with my own hands.\nSun and rain together lend the strength of spring,\nNo worry that the seedlings will fail to flourish.\n\n**XXIII**\nReturn to the root, restore life, recover original truth,\nQi enters the four limbs, essence nourishes spirit.\nIf spirit and qi do not scatter,\nOne merges with the dusty world as a carefree soul.\n\n**XXIV**\nA single thing floats and sinks, now present, now absent,\nFit to welcome autumn dew that drips as true pearls.\nAmidst misty flowers and willow lanes, it is everywhere,\nWhether foul or fragrant, it serves as needed.\n\n**XXV**\nNow I have obtained the method of long life,\nYear after year, I seek a kindred spirit upon the sea.\nWho might that kindred spirit be?\nEarnestly seek it in my wild words.\n\n**XXVI**\nFor years I have diligently sought immortal companions,\nUnwilling to cease until I become a divine immortal.\nWhen conditions align, the great Dao naturally forms,\nHow could I let the vulgar seek its traces?\n\n**XXVII**\nFrom parents’ birth, the true unified qi,\nFormless and shadowless, suddenly hard to find.\nTo know the wondrous mystery of black and white,\nSoul and spirit must unite to produce purple gold.\n\n**XXVIII**\nThe foundation of supreme goodness is most profound,\nThe Flowery Pond’s divine water determines floating and sinking.\nWhere the divine work operates fire, drawing and adding,\nRefine the self, hold fast to the heart—do not let it wander.\n\n**XXIX**\nEast, west, south, north—master them all,\nYin and yang interact, female and male.\nThe fire-timing must be steadfast and precise,\nBlowing and breathing rely on the *xun* palace’s wind.\n\n**XXX**\nHeaven and Earth unite through *Pi* and *Tai*,\n*Zhun* and *Meng*’s qi-timing interpenetrate.\nOne husband, one wife draw upon Heaven and Earth,\nThree wives, three sons complete the beginning and end.\n\n**Two Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\n**I**\nBrushing aside the marketplace’s dazzling glare,\nDo not entrust the great Dao to human sentiment.\nPity the divine immortals of old—\nDeliberately feigning foolishness, never speaking.\n\n**II**\nOne return per month makes one cycle,\nNine returns in a year complete nine reversals.\nRely solely on the two hexagrams to weigh punishment and virtue,\nFive or six times they return to *wu* and *ji*.\n\n**Nine *Xijiangyue* Lyrics**\n\n**I**\n\n**II**\nOne is the total count of the Golden Elixir,\nThe *Hetu*’s image reveals the true mechanism.\nWho knows the formless abyss holds the subtlest mystery?\nThe great Dao from this begins its gestation.\nThe Dipper’s handle turns the jade pivot to its rightful place,\nWithin yin it embraces the radiance of yang.\nKunlun’s mother and child don scarlet robes—\nThis is the true principle of Qian and Kun.\n\n**III**\nIn the crescent-moon furnace, the golden tripod,\nThe Three Terraces and the Two Luminaries shape spirit and form.\nNoble and base are simply discerned in the mercury’s truth—\nGrasp firmly, do not mistake heart for kidneys.\nThe White Tiger ever guards the Kan gate,\nThe Azure Dragon instead neighbors the south.\nYin’s hun and yang’s po are like dust on a window—\nThe great meaning never strays from the Mysterious Female.\n\n**IV**\nThe three pure realms of Heaven,\nThe patterns of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.\nThe disciples of Laozi and Confucius in their halos,\nScriptures and histories deeply conceal their wondrous essence.\nOccasionally a true person appears in the world,\nYet the infant’s dark pearl remains obscure.\nThe toad’s light shines all day on dim thoroughfares,\nWhile yellow sprouts fill the eye in full display.\n\n**V**\nWithin, the five phases restrain one another,\nEncompassing a single grain of red lead.\nMutually generating and destroying by nature’s own hand,\nThis medicine knows no high or low.\nTurn to my own garden,\nCultivate a *mu* of celestial field.\nMiddle son and little daughter join as one—\nPlanting, you harvest yellow sprouts throughout the courtyard.\n\n**VI**\nBreak open the three and five of the Mysterious Origin,\nPart the alchemical jade tablet of creation’s work.\n\nThe wondrous essence of the Profound and Invisible dwells at the center,\nWithin a span so near, yet nameless and formless.\nA moment’s effort suffices—\nTeaching you to endure as heaven and earth,\nWhere Penglai’s immortal isles are my homeland.\nYet you pay no heed, nor turn your faith toward it.\n\n**VII**\nA bamboo split must be mended with bamboo,\nA man’s decline requires lead to restore wholeness.\nReflect, and it lies right before your eyes—\nOnly the men of this age fail to see.\nSun and moon conjoin in *Li* and *Kan*,\nTortoise and serpent emerge from the primordial.\nThe elixir of long life lies in your own garden,\nA moment’s effort reveals it.\n\n**VIII**\nThis Dao is most numinous, most sacred,\nTake care not to leak or treat it lightly.\nIt relies entirely on virtue and conduct in harmony,\nAnd guard your words lest cunning and debate arise.\nTo harness the waxing and waning of the five phases,\nOne must grasp the flourishing of yang and the decline of yin.\nThree like-minded souls must vigilantly avoid peril,\nAnd tend the fire’s work with utmost care.\n\n**IX**\nRefine it into luminous, gleaming jade,\nThen return to enter the Yellow Springs.\nAscension requires three full years,\nNurtured with diligent devotion and love.\nOnly when the nine nines are complete does transformation occur—\nSuch divine power cannot be proclaimed in words.\nClearly, in but a moment you become an immortal,\nForever riding the phoenix carriage and simurgh palanquin.\n\n**X**\nAt the first return of the primordial qi, it meets the new moon,\nWithin the crucible, the divine water is warm.\nHard and soft unite, qi evenly balanced—\nThe wonder lies in never surpassing the undifferentiated.\nThe eight trigrams revolve in cycles,\nDriving the nine orifices in pursuit.\nEast and west, movement and stillness align with dawn and dusk—\nDo not discuss this with ordinary men.\n\n**Thirty-Four Songs of the Elixir Marrow**\n\n**I**\nRefining the elixir needs no winter solstice,\nFor within the body, a yang naturally arises.\nThe dragon soars over the Red Water, waves surging,\nThe tiger roars on Cinnabar Mountain, wind and dew pure.\n\n**II**\nAt first, it is like clouds emerging from a cave,\nThen like the moon resting in a pool.\nAgain, it resembles a golden silkworm or jade shoot—\nApply the fire’s timing to refine it thrice.\n\n**III**\nGraceful as Xi Shi leaving the golden pavilion,\nLovely as Yang Guifei descending the jade tower.\nDay after day, drunk with you beneath the blossoms—\nWhat place could be more carefree?\n\n**IV**\nA muddy snake dances the *zhezhi* in the well,\nThe bright moon at the window illuminates plum and pear.\nWhen night comes and the undifferentiated crashes to earth,\nThe ten thousand images and all phenomena know nothing of it.\n\n**V**\nLong ago, I met my teacher’s true oral instructions—\nOnly to concentrate spirit and enter the qi’s cavity.\nTransform essence into qi, qi into spirit,\nRefining them into yellow sprouts and white snow.\n\n**VI**\nFor a year, bathe and guard against peril,\nFor ten months, harmonize and observe restraint.\nHaving ingested cinnabar, ascend to Jade Capital,\nMounting a crane to ascend the heavenly gate.\n\n**VII**\nThe crow has no form, the hare no shadow—\nCrow and hare are but the essence of sun and moon.\nWhen crow and hare unite, heaven and earth endure.\n\n**VIII**\nThe ox has no horns, the horse no hooves—\nOx and horse are but the marrow of *Qian* and *Kun*.\n*Qian* and *Kun* operate through *Kan* and *Li*.\n\n**IX**\nThe tortoise has no image, the serpent no trace—\nTortoise and serpent are but the forms of yin and yang.\nWhen the two qi unite, they merge as one.\n\n**X**\nLead is not lead, mercury is not mercury—\nLead and mercury are sought within the body.\nKeep body and mind still and unmoving.\n\n**XII**\nNo white snow, no yellow sprouts—\nWhite snow is the water of the spirit chamber,\nYellow sprouts are the flowers of the qi’s pivot.\n\n**XIII**\nA true husband, a true wife—\nWhen *Kan*’s man and *Li*’s woman unite in resonance,\nThe empty void is without dust, heaven and earth revealed.\n\n**XIV**\nTrue *jiaoli* pears, true fire jujubes—\nAfter eating *jiaoli*, the four limbs are refined,\nWhen fire jujubes are swallowed, ten thousand kalpas are sated.\n\n**XV**\nWater is true water, fire is true fire—\nAs before, await the season and circulate the celestial cycle.\nHarmonize and refine it into the treasure of long life.\n\n**XVII**\nThe sun’s soul, the moon’s marrow—\nWithin the body, there is a true *Qian* and *Kun*.\nTemper the cinnabar field until it glows red.\n\n**XVIII**\nHeaven’s honor, earth’s humility—\nSeize heaven’s soul to capture the six thieves,\nAnd use earth’s marrow to restrain the three corpses.\n\n**XIX**\nThe medicine is not a thing, the fire is not a season—\nClearly, it is but a single spark of yang,\nRefined into boundless longevity for ten thousand kalpas.\n\n**XX**\nMetal is not *Dui*, wood is not *Zhen*—\nFrom of old, true earth responds to the five phases,\nMetal and wood naturally resolve their union.\n\n**XXI**\nBlack within white, white within black—\nOnly by guarding the black does the white appear,\nFor black and white were never two colors.\n\n**XXII**\nGold is true gold, silver is true silver—\nGold and silver refined into the purple golden elixir,\nNaturally leaving no trace of chisel or carving.\n\n**XXIII**\nThe crescent moon furnace, the cinnabar crucible—\nKnow to embrace the One and guard the center,\nNo need to penetrate the passes or cast into the jade well.\n\n**XXIV**\nThe central cauldron, the guarded altar—\nKeep the golden crucible’s broth ever warm,\nLet not the jade furnace’s fire grow cold.\n\n**XXV**\nMysterious is true mystery, female is true female—\nMystery and female all converge in a single aperture,\nNot in mouth or nose, heart or kidneys.\n\n**XXVI**\nTrue divine water, true flowery pond—\nThe primordial qi is empty and formless, hard to grasp,\nThe primordial qi is vast and indistinct, fundamentally non-doing.\n\n**XXVII**\nRefine cinnabar, refine mercury—\nTruly use cinnabar to contain mercury,\nRefine mercury into bright window dust.\n\n**XXVIII**\nTrue yellow chariot, true purple powder—\nClearly within the inner crucible and inner furnace,\nTransforming tiles and stones into nine revolutions.\n\n**XXIX**\nTrue barrier locks, true paired carts—\nIron locks and golden passes firmly guard,\nThe river chariot’s movement coagulates cinnabar.\n\n**XXX**\nTrue golden essence, true jade liquid—\nThe crucible filled, qi returns to the root of jade liquid,\nJade liquid brimming the vessel, spirit enters the chamber.\n\n**XXXI**\nTrue golden elder, true maiden—\nGolden elder and maiden join in marriage,\nIn the depths of the bridal chamber, true clouds and rain.\n\n**XXXII**\nTrue Ding Gong, true Yellow Matron—\nDing Gong stokes the fire to refine golden flowers,\nThe Yellow Matron nurtures the golden goose in her jar.\n\n**XXXIII**\nTrue infant, true red child—\nAfter nine revolutions, refined into a ten-month embryo,\nPure yang without yin, life never dies.\n\n**XXXIV**\nTrue yin-yang, true yin-yang—\nYin and yang are but two words,\nYet they illustrate the elixir texts of ten thousand chapters.",

      "translated_text": "**Preface to the *Returning Elixir and Restoring the Mandate***\n\nAlas! Man possesses a body, yet how long he has remained benighted. Names and profits plunder his heart; right and wrong ravage his will. Day by day, he sinks deeper into meanness and stinginess, unaware of the excellence of the Dao, ever drifting farther from it.\n\nYet the Supreme Dao is not distant—it abides always before our eyes. Thus the immortal scriptures say: *\"The Great Dao flows freely, ever near to left and right.\"* Though there be those who walk the Way, who would reveal its mysteries to others, who would believe them?\n\nMy own crude and reckless words are unworthy of trust. To expound the Way of the Golden Crucible and Returning Elixir to the world is even less fitting. Those who possess the Dao shall know it for themselves.\n\nIn my early years of Daoist study, all I encountered were scholars of principle. Yet if their habitual leaks remained unsealed, they still followed the cycle of birth and death. As for those who \"sit and shed the body\" or \"stand and depart,\" who seize a womb or usurp a vessel—never have I seen one attain sudden and lasting transcendence.\n\nI once reflected that Confucius \"exhausted principle and fulfilled nature to reach destiny,\" while the Old Master ascended and took flight. Thus I knew the intent of the sages could not be grasped by a single path alone.\n\nIn the *gengzi* year of the Xuanhe era, I received oral instructions from a perfected one, who said: *\"The Ancestor of the Great Dao arises from a single qi, which transforms all things. It is likened to the sun and moon, named the Dragon and Tiger, divided into yin and yang, and entrusted to Heaven and Earth. One clear, one turbid—Metal and Wood stand apart at the Gate of *wu* and *ji*. One nature, one emotion—yin and yang converge at the Portal of Life and Death. Gather the qi of the Two Modes before their division; seize the essence of the Dragon and Tiger at their first union. Enter the Yellow Chamber, and there produce the supreme treasure. Beyond this lies the pivot of the Dharma-image and the marvelous workings of return. The secret of longevity is complete herein.\"*\n\nOnly then did I realize the Great Dao is not complex—one must but meet a perfected master, receive their oral instructions, and thus arrive at the true threshold.\n\nFor decades, what I had pursued were but the remnants of the sages. Only now did I grasp the principle that things do not truly change. *\"One yin, one yang—this is the Dao; partial yin or partial yang—this is illness.\"* The mechanism of the Dragon and Tiger, the principle of Metal and Wood—this is the true instruction.

      "translated_text": "Formerly, the scholars of Zou and Lu, the gentry and masters, were largely able to comprehend these truths—yet in recent times, none remain who do. Following the oral instructions of my teacher, I composed sixteen five-character poems to express the measure of \"two eights make one catty.\" Thirty seven-character quatrains correspond to the thirty days of great achievement. Nine additional *Xijiangyue* verses align with the nine-fold cyclical method. Here is made clear the discernment of medicinal substances, their gathering, the generation and destruction of the Five Phases, the sequence of host and guest, the waxing and waning of punitive and virtuous forces, the techniques of extraction and augmentation, and the precise measures of fire-tending—all without omission.\n\nThose who cherish the Dao should study this text closely; some, by virtue of karmic affinity, may naturally encounter its truths. Though the language be coarse, each word speaks only of reality.\n\n*Preface by Xue Daoguang in the autumn of the bingwu year of the Jingkang era.*\n\n**Sixteen Five-Character Regulated Verses**\n\n**I**\nThere exists a thing with numinous form,\nNameless, rooted in the natural.\nThe Crimson Dragon hides in the cosmos,\nThe White Tiger conceals in the Cinnabar Field.\nBeneath the Northern Dipper, southward spread,\nBy brows and lashes’ edge.\nWith ashen heart, practice Water and Fire,\nIn settled breath, seek true Lead.\n\n**II**\nEssence and qi are the primal foundation,\nSpirit and numen share one household.\nSimply capture the Five Thieves,\nAnd naturally coalesce the Three Flowers.\nLet not *jia* and *yi* go astray,\nNor *geng* and *xin* err.\nWhen the solitary yang returns to rightful command,\nThe Seven Returns set the River Chariot in motion.\n\n**III**\nThis matter is truly hard to fathom,\nWise and foolish alike fail to discern.\nThe sparrow is no kin to the phoenix,\nThe horse does not herd with the sheep.\nA special product, just three hundred,\nHeaven and Earth share one catty.\nPatrolling the twelve paths,\nThe barefoot fierce general.\n\n**IV**\nOne, two, three, four, five,\nThe Southern Aster faces the Northern Aster.\nTiger and Dragon cradle azure jade,\nMetal and Wood gestate pearl and treasure.\nClouds disperse, moonlight fills every home,\nFlowers bloom, spring graces every place.\nHow many wanderers beyond the clouds—\nAll are but people of this world.\n\n**V**\nHaving received the true immortal’s formula,\nWithin yin, refine to utmost yang.\nWhere the earth-thunder stirs in concealment,\nThe stars and constellations deliberate together.\nThe Eight Trigrams behold the completed Mother,\nThe Three Powers first witness flourishing.\nNo need to fret over life and death’s entanglements,\nOnly sense the enduring vastness of Earth and Heaven.\n\n**VI**\nYin and yang share one art,\nIts subtlety profound and deeply hidden.\nWith intent, seek *geng* and *jia*,\nWith single mind, serve *bing* the King.\nCapture the Bird and the Hare,\nSeize Water and Metal.\nDiscern the things of east and west,\nAnd cultivate the mind of non-duality.\n\n**VII**\nGraceful and supple in bearing,\nPlayfully tender and soft.\nFrom the heartless strings, take it,\nFrom the earth, gather soul and spirit.\nThe cap-pole unites Lead and Mercury,\nThe numinous light shoots toward Dipper and Ox.\nYouth is most yin and dung—\nLet not old age claim your spring.\n\n**VIII**\nUnrestrained and carefree,\nLofty grows the Dao.\nWithin the wondrous, black and white lie hidden,\nIn leisure, shun the toil of dust.\nSitting or lying, the Three Peaks steady,\nThe Cinnabar Field’s two qi secure.\nKnow surely you escape the world’s snares,\nYour name listed among the immortals’ ranks.\n\n**IX**\nGathering must be done in secrecy,\nWith sincere heart, distinguish ugliness and beauty.\nThe matter is difficult—trace the thread of intent,\nEasy to lose the cold spring.\nThe teacher points to the Azure Dragon’s Mercury,\nTo pair with the White Tiger’s Lead.\nWhen both are united,\nWater and Fire refine for years.\n\n**X**\nGuard the One within the altar’s core,\nThe mechanism hidden in the twelve hours.\nWithin the numbers, let nothing stray,\nIn fire-tending, let no delay occur.\nOnly the enlightened may be your companion,\nTrue immortals are most fitting.\nFor years upon the clouds and waters,\nWho knows the longing in your heart?\n\n**XI**\nHumans possess the most numinous thing,\nVaguely present near the Northern Aster.\nNot knowing, one calls it qi,\nBut recognizing it, it becomes naturally true.\nThe heart still as ice and snow,\nThe body light as azure clouds.\nWithout a thousand myriad years,\nWhy be a person of this world?\n\n**XII**\nIn bustling markets, mingling with people,\nClearly and openly, coming and going.\nAwakened, there is but one thing,\nDeluded, a thousand mountains divide.\nDivine Water lies below the Cinnabar Field,\nThe Flowery Pond between Water and Fire.\nOne primordial force enables creation,\nReturning the old to youthful countenance.\n\n**XIII**\nSkill and clumsiness still lie concealed,\nSpirit and intent envelop all.\nKan and Li mutually employ each other,\nMetal and Wood delight in their union.\nWhite Snow can share the crucible,\nYellow Sprout dwells in one bud.\nHeaven and Earth reckon nine and six,\nFu and Gou move the initial line.\n\n**XIV**\nOne thing divides into two,\nKnow the names of these two.\nThe tripod and furnace hold sun and moon,\nThe drip and the third watch.\nHusband and wife unite in congress,\nThe infant begins to form.\nShedding the womb and bathing,\nNurtured to ensure long life.\n\n**XV**\nHaving consumed the numinous elixir,\nThe purely yang person is at ease.\nLucid and ever still, shining,\nPenglai Isle abides in eternal spring.\nComing and going, utterly unbound,\nWandering freely, beyond all dust.\nSimply know the cycle of *jiazi*,\nNo need to guard *geng* and *xin*.\n\n**XVI**\nSeeking the Dao, pursuing the true,\nRoaming the shores of the four seas.\nOutwardly, endure humiliation with forbearance,\nInwardly, accept hardship and delay.\nWeary of worldly affairs,\nJoyful to meet a guest of the Purple Palace.\nA single word of direct instruction,\nAnd the Jade Grotto’s emerald peach blossoms in spring.\n\n**Thirty Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\n**I**\nAll things arise from one qi,\nHeaven clear, Earth turbid, endowed with life.\nWhen true Dragon and true Tiger first unite,\nIn one crucible, red Lead refines *jia* and *geng*.\n\n**II**\nYin and yang pair as ruler and minister,\nMovement and stillness combine qi, blood, and essence.\nIn the *ren* and *gui* positions, the man strikes the waves,\nBy the *bing* and *ding* crags, the woman frequently moans.\n\n**III**\nDragon and Tiger, once entwined in affection,\nKan and Li, just conjoined, form the embryo.\nA full measure of the marrow of Heaven and Earth,\nWith intent, seek to sip and take it in.\n\n**IV**\nThings gather by kind, groups divide,\nTwo sides share one scale, one catty.\nWithin the *wu* and *ji* palace, Water and Fire lie hidden,\nTend carefully with martial and civil arts.\n\n**V**\nIn the Li Palace, an image conceals true Water,\nAt the Kan Gate, formless, the Crimson Dragon hides.\nWhen the season is right, gather swiftly,\nLest the sprouts overflow the Yellow Palace.\n\n**VI**\nThirty spokes unite in one hub,\nMetal and Wood, when the two qi meet.\nThe sixty-four hexagrams divide morning and evening,\nThe solitary yang sprouts, stirring the initial line.",

      "translated_text": "**VII**\nWithin yin’s thirteen, forms take shape,\nWithin yang’s six and seven, no trace is found.\nIn drawing and adding, exercise utmost care,\nDiscern the root-source, the Ancestor and the Clan.\n\n**VIII**\nAmidst the indistinct, seek the form,\nWithin the boundless dark, find true essence.\nTrue essence is the elixir of long life,\nYet it must be nurtured by the Yellow Dame.\n\n**IX**\nWithin six hundred chapters, scrutinize closely,\nProbe the hidden and the soaring to fathom subtleties.\nFamiliar and distant, intertwined and known,\nSteal the mechanism of the Seven Stars and Southern Dipper.\n\n**X**\nYin cauldron, yang furnace—the root of the supreme Dao,\nFive phases harmonized, with Earth as sovereign.\nIf one seeks the elixir of long life,\nLook only to the Flowery Pond for soul and spirit.\n\n**XI**\nThe sage transmits the medicine, not the fire,\nFor the fire-timing has ever been known by few.\nDo not treat the great Dao as child’s play,\nBut ponder it carefully with the immortals.\n\n**XII**\nFire-timing, drawing and adding—thoughts transcend dust,\nOne line observed, another arises.\nYin’s script and yang’s martial art follow increase and decrease,\nA pellet of returning cinnabar is forged in the fire.\n\n**XIII**\nSwallowing saliva, absorbing qi to secure the body whole,\nOne must rely on Heaven and Earth’s true mercury and lead.\nThe supreme Dao is not complex—people obscure it themselves,\nThe five metals and eight stones are but empty claims.\n\n**XIV**\nThe two qi arise as the child gives birth to the mother,\nSeized in the crucible at the opportune moment.\nHusband’s joy, wife’s union in the golden chamber,\nAfter one year, a child is born of the embryo.\n\n**XV**\nGrasp the wondrous cause of yin and yang,\nRefine the golden liquid to transcend the mortal dust.\nWashing and settling are no ordinary matters,\nThe Crimson Maiden and Infant Boy must both be true.\n\n**XVI**\nDrive back the Northern Dipper, turn the Celestial Stem,\nGrasp the Southern Star and enter the grotto chamber.\nWithin the *Pi* and *Tai* lines, Heaven and Earth unite,\nThe Hare and Rooster bathe—conceal them well.\n\n**XVII**\nIn the Crystal Palace, the green-robed maiden is fair,\nA scene of splendor breaks the solitude.\nSeize the essence and marrow of Hare and Crow,\nHasten to gather and refine them in the crucible.\n\n**XVIII**\nBanish self and other, guard the elixir chamber,\nThen time’s passage and qi’s savor seem long.\nNeither glory nor disgrace follows the guest beyond the dust,\nOnly in the golden crucible is lead frost refined.\n\n**XIX**\nTiger’s marrow, dragon’s essence—qi and image complete,\nCultivate by the method, simmer with fire-timing.\nWait until yin dissolves to form the supreme chamber,\nThen you will know how immortals hide on level ground.\n\n**XX**\nA trifling celestial mechanism speaks of qi and essence,\nMaster Lü once said there is no other truth.\nThe immortals dare not speak plainly,\nFor to speak plainly would invite mockery.\n\n**XXI**\nNine returns, seven reversals determine the Three Powers,\nOpening and closing, drawing and adding all depend on the medium.\nThe Four Symbols converge in *wu* and *ji*,\nWith sincerity, after ten months, an infant is born.\n\n**XXII**\nOf late, my livelihood has grown ever more refined,\nTilling a mu of sandy field with my own hands.\nSun and rain together lend the strength of spring,\nNo worry that the seedlings will fail to flourish.\n\n**XXIII**\nReturn to the root, restore life, recover original truth,\nQi enters the four limbs, essence nourishes spirit.\nIf spirit and qi do not scatter,\nOne merges with the dusty world as a carefree soul.\n\n**XXIV**\nA single thing floats and sinks, now present, now absent,\nFit to welcome autumn dew that drips as true pearls.\nAmidst misty flowers and willow lanes, it is everywhere,\nWhether foul or fragrant, it serves as needed.\n\n**XXV**\nNow I have obtained the method of long life,\nYear after year, I seek a kindred spirit upon the sea.\nWho might that kindred spirit be?\nEarnestly seek it in my wild words.\n\n**XXVI**\nFor years I have diligently sought immortal companions,\nUnwilling to cease until I become a divine immortal.\nWhen conditions align, the great Dao naturally forms,\nHow could I let the vulgar seek its traces?\n\n**XXVII**\nFrom parents’ birth, the true unified qi,\nFormless and shadowless, suddenly hard to find.\nTo know the wondrous mystery of black and white,\nSoul and spirit must unite to produce purple gold.\n\n**XXVIII**\nThe foundation of supreme goodness is most profound,\nThe Flowery Pond’s divine water determines floating and sinking.\nWhere the divine work operates fire, drawing and adding,\nRefine the self, hold fast to the heart—do not let it wander.\n\n**XXIX**\nEast, west, south, north—master them all,\nYin and yang interact, female and male.\nThe fire-timing must be steadfast and precise,\nBlowing and breathing rely on the *xun* palace’s wind.\n\n**XXX**\nHeaven and Earth unite through *Pi* and *Tai*,\n*Zhun* and *Meng*’s qi-timing interpenetrate.\nOne husband, one wife draw upon Heaven and Earth,\nThree wives, three sons complete the beginning and end.\n\n**Two Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\n**I**\nBrushing aside the marketplace’s dazzling glare,\nDo not

      "translated_text": "The wondrous essence of the Profound and Invisible dwells at the center,\nWithin a span so near, yet nameless and formless.\nA moment’s effort suffices—\nTeaching you to endure as heaven and earth,\nWhere Penglai’s immortal isles are my homeland.\nYet you pay no heed, nor turn your faith toward it.\n\n**VII**\nA bamboo split must be mended with bamboo,\nA man’s decline requires lead to restore wholeness.\nReflect, and it lies right before your eyes—\nOnly the men of this age fail to see.\nSun and moon conjoin in *Li* and *Kan*,\nTortoise and serpent emerge from the primordial.\nThe elixir of long life lies in your own garden,\nA moment’s effort reveals it.\n\n**VIII**\nThis Dao is most numinous, most sacred,\nTake care not to leak or treat it lightly.\nIt relies entirely on virtue and conduct in harmony,\nAnd guard your words lest cunning and debate arise.\nTo harness the waxing and waning of the five phases,\nOne must grasp the flourishing of yang and the decline of yin.\nThree like-minded souls must vigilantly avoid peril,\nAnd tend the fire’s work with utmost care.\n\n**IX**\nRefine it into luminous, gleaming jade,\nThen return to enter the Yellow Springs.\nAscension requires three full years,\nNurtured with diligent devotion and love.\nOnly when the nine nines are complete does transformation occur—\nSuch divine power cannot be proclaimed in words.\nClearly, in but a moment you become an immortal,\nForever riding the phoenix carriage and simurgh palanquin.\n\n**X**\nAt the first return of the primordial qi, it meets the new moon,\nWithin the crucible, the divine water is warm.\nHard and soft unite, qi evenly balanced—\nThe wonder lies in never surpassing the undifferentiated.\nThe eight trigrams revolve in cycles,\nDriving the nine orifices in pursuit.\nEast and west, movement and stillness align with dawn and dusk—\nDo not discuss this with ordinary men.\n\n**Thirty-Four Songs of the Elixir Marrow**\n\n**I**\nRefining the elixir needs no winter solstice,\nFor within the body, a yang naturally arises.\nThe dragon soars over the Red Water, waves surging,\nThe tiger roars on Cinnabar Mountain, wind and dew pure.\n\n**II**\nAt first, it is like clouds emerging from a cave,\nThen like the moon resting in a pool.\nAgain, it resembles a golden silkworm or jade shoot—\nApply the fire’s timing to refine it thrice.\n\n**III**\nGraceful as Xi Shi leaving the golden pavilion,\nLovely as Yang Guifei descending the jade tower.\nDay after day, drunk with you beneath the blossoms—\nWhat place could be more carefree?\n\n**IV**\nA muddy snake dances the *zhezhi* in the well,\nThe bright moon at the window illuminates plum and pear.\nWhen night comes and the undifferentiated crashes to earth,\nThe ten thousand images and all phenomena know nothing of it.\n\n**V**\nLong ago, I met my teacher’s true oral instructions—\nOnly to concentrate spirit and enter the qi’s cavity.\nTransform essence into qi, qi into spirit,\nRefining them into yellow sprouts and white snow.\n\n**VI**\nFor a year, bathe and guard against peril,\nFor ten months, harmonize and observe restraint.\nHaving ingested cinnabar, ascend to Jade Capital,\nMounting a crane to ascend the heavenly gate.\n\n**VII**\nThe crow has no form, the hare no shadow—\nCrow and hare are but the essence of sun and moon.\nWhen crow and hare unite, heaven and earth endure.\n\n**VIII**\nThe ox has no horns, the horse no hooves—\nOx and horse are but the marrow of *Qian* and *Kun*.\n*Qian* and *Kun* operate through *Kan* and *Li*.\n\n**IX**\nThe tortoise has no image, the serpent no trace—\nTortoise and serpent are but the forms of yin and yang.\nWhen the two qi unite, they merge as one.\n\n**X**\nLead is not lead, mercury is not mercury—\nLead and mercury are sought within the body.\nKeep body and mind still and unmoving.\n\n**XII**\nNo white snow, no yellow sprouts—\nWhite snow is the water of the spirit chamber,\nYellow sprouts are the flowers of the qi’s pivot.\n\n**XIII**\nA true husband, a true wife—\nWhen *Kan*’s man and *Li*’s woman unite in resonance,\nThe empty void is without dust, heaven and earth revealed.\n\n**XIV**\nTrue *jiaoli* pears, true fire jujubes—\nAfter eating *jiaoli*, the four limbs are refined,\nWhen fire jujubes are swallowed, ten thousand kalpas are sated.\n\n**XV**\nWater is true water, fire is true fire—\nAs before, await the season and circulate the celestial cycle.\nHarmonize and refine it into the treasure of long life.\n\n**XVII**\nThe sun’s soul, the moon’s marrow—\nWithin the body, there is a true *Qian* and *Kun*.\nTemper the cinnabar field until it glows red.\n\n**XVIII**\nHeaven’s honor, earth’s humility—\nSeize heaven’s soul to capture the six thieves,\nAnd use earth’s marrow to restrain the three corpses.\n\n**XIX**\nThe medicine is not a thing, the fire is not a season—\nClearly, it is but a single spark of yang,\nRefined into boundless longevity for ten thousand kalpas.\n\n**XX**\nMetal is not *Dui*, wood is not *Zhen*—\nFrom of old, true earth responds to the five phases,\nMetal and wood naturally resolve their union.\n\n**XXI**\nBlack within white, white within black—\nOnly by guarding the black does the white appear,\nFor black and white were never two colors.\n\n**XXII**\nGold is true gold, silver is true silver—\nGold and silver refined into the purple golden elixir,\nNaturally leaving no trace of chisel or carving.\n\n**XXIII**\nThe crescent moon furnace, the cinnabar crucible—\nKnow to embrace the One and guard the center,\nNo need to penetrate the passes or cast into the jade well.\n\n**XXIV**\nThe central cauldron, the guarded altar—\nKeep the golden crucible’s broth ever warm,\nLet not the jade furnace’s fire grow cold.\n\n**XXV**\nMysterious is true mystery, female is true female—\nMystery and female all converge in a single aperture,\nNot in mouth or nose, heart or kidneys.\n\n**XXVI**\nTrue divine water, true flowery pond—\nThe primordial qi is empty and formless, hard to grasp,\nThe primordial qi is vast and indistinct, fundamentally non-doing.\n\n**XXVII**\nRefine cinnabar, refine mercury—\nTruly use cinnabar to contain mercury,\nRefine mercury into bright window dust.\n\n**XXVIII**\nTrue yellow chariot, true purple powder—\nClearly within the inner crucible and inner furnace,\nTransforming tiles and stones into nine revolutions.\n\n**XXIX**\nTrue barrier locks, true paired carts—\nIron locks and golden passes firmly guard,\nThe river chariot’s movement coagulates cinnabar.\n\n**XXX**\nTrue golden essence, true jade liquid—\nThe crucible filled, qi returns to the root of jade liquid,\nJade liquid brimming the vessel, spirit enters the chamber.\n\n**XXXI**\nTrue golden elder, true maiden—\nGolden elder and maiden join in marriage,\nIn the depths of the bridal chamber, true clouds and rain.\n\n**XXXII**\nTrue Ding Gong, true Yellow Matron—\nDing Gong stokes the fire to refine golden flowers,\nThe Yellow Matron nurtures the golden goose in her jar.\n\n**XXXIII**\nTrue infant, true red child—\nAfter nine revolutions, refined into a ten-month embryo,\nPure yang without yin, life never dies.\n\n**XXXIV**\nTrue yin-yang, true yin-yang—\nYin and yang are but two words,\nYet they illustrate the elixir texts of ten thousand chapters.",
      "overlap_context": " fill the eye in full display.\n\n**V**\nWithin, the five phases restrain one another,\nEncompassing a single grain of red lead.\nMutually generating and destroying by nature’s own hand,\nThis medicine knows no high or low.\nTurn to my own garden,\nCultivate a *mu* of celestial field.\nMiddle son and little daughter join as one—\nPlanting, you harvest yellow sprouts throughout the courtyard.\n\n**VI**\nBreak open the three and five of the Mysterious Origin,\nPart the alchemical jade tablet of creation’s work.",
