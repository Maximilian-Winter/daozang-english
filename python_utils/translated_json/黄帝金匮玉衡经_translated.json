One scroll.\n\n**Source:** Compiled in the *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dòngzhēn* (Verdant Perfection) section, under *Zhòngshù* (Miscellaneous Arts).\n\n---\n\n**Huangdi’s *Jīnkuì Yùhé Jing***\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said:\n*\"I now entrust to you these two treasures—\nthe *Jīnkuì* [Golden Case] and the *Yùhé* [Jade Balance] Classic.\nGuard them well.\nIf not given to the worthy, the Dao will not manifest in vain.\n\nWith passive ease and non-action,\nyet wisdom remains unclear.\nWithout leaving your chamber,\nyou may know the world’s affairs;\nwithout stepping beyond your door,\nyou may attain the True Sovereign.\n\nClarifying vision reveals fortune and calamity—\nyet only the most refined may master this art.\nSeal your lips, seal your lips—\ndisaster will not approach.\nReveal the Dao’s truth,\nand your life will surely be exhausted.\n\nThough distant lands may have their methods,\ntheir essence aligns with the Way.\nHide it, conceal it—\ndo not expose it to the ignorant.\"*\n\n---\n\n**The Celestial Sovereign’s Authority**\nThe *Tiānyī* [Celestial One], the Noble Spirit,\nholds dominion in the Central Palace,\ncommanding the *Xuánjī* [Celestial Globe] and wielding the Jade Balance,\ngoverning the Four Seasons,\nharmonizing yin and yang,\ngrasping the plumb-line and square,\nupright in *Kuaìgāng* [Marshal Stars],\nleft *Fáng* [Palace], right *Shēn* [Star],\nback to the void, front to expansion,\narranged in four and seven,\ncommanding the eight directions,\nmeasuring heaven and earth,\nbreathing in yin and yang,\nfive at the fore, six behind—\nthus revealing fortune and calamity.\n\nThe Azure Dragon rules the left,\ngoverning *Jiǎo* [Horn] and *Kàng* [Wing];\nthe White Tiger aids the right,\nupright in *Zài* [Wealth] and *Shēn* [Star].\nThe Vermilion Bird soars ahead,\nflapping wings in dance;\nthe Dark Warrior lingers behind,\nreceiving virtue and completing deeds.\n\nThe *Liùhé* [Six Harmonies] transmit their mandates,\n*Gōuchén* [Hooked Array] General leads,\nthe Remaining Serpent is slain—\nmetal and iron clash resoundingly.\n\nThe Celestial Consort, the Noble Match,\nthe Grand Minister of Rites attends.\nThe Dark Moon’s Marshal,\nrecords the harem’s affairs;\nthe Celestial Void, lowly in station,\nserves in the Imperial Court.\n\nThe White Tiger brings harm—\nexamine its fortune and calamity;\neach has its appointed ranks—\nnone may act in reckless defiance.\n\n*Tiānyī* governs all;\ninner and outer realms are clear.\nMetal, wood, water, fire—\neach has its ordered ranks.\nIf *Kuaìgāng* [Marshal Stars] are not rectified,\nthe foundation is first established in *Wù-Jǐ* [Earth-Stems five and six].\n\nHeaven’s native domain\nthus governs the center;\ndivine qi is concealed—\nfrom *Jiǎzǐ* to *Guǐyǒu*,\n*Xū-Hài* [Stems eleven and twelve] are solitary voids.\n\nThe ancestral tomb of the Kingly Father,\nif not within the decan,\n*Kuaìgāng* [Marshal Stars] are not rectified—\nthis is called *double calamity*.\n\nThirty-six applications:\nthe *Jīnkuì* and *Yùfáng* [Jade Chamber],\n*Tiānyī* most exalted, as sovereign king;\nthe Central Marshal’s awe-inspiring might—\nmajestic, resplendent.\n\n**Jīnkuì Chapter**\n*Tiān*—the *Liùrén* [Six Ren] divination begins.\n\n「The First Canon states:\nWithin the **day-pillar** and **hour-pillar**, if there is mutual opposition between **yin** and **yang**, it is called *use*—this is the most urgent of the *entry* and *non-entry* (入不入).\n\nWhat is meant by **day-pillar** and **hour-pillar**? Suppose today is *Jiazi* (甲子): the first *Jia* (甲) is the **day-pillar**, and *Zi* (子) is the **hour-pillar**.\n**Yin** and **yang** refer to the **divine yang** (陽神) of the day-pillar and the **divine yin** (陰神) of the hour-pillar.\n\nSuppose in the first month, on a *Jiazi* (甲子) day at dawn:\nIf *Dengming* (登明) governs *Jia* (甲), there is no mutual opposition;\nIf *Kuaìgāng* (魁罡) governs *Zi* (子), there is no mutual opposition;\nIf *Chuánsòng* (傳送) is the *Dengming* (登明) yin, there is no mutual opposition;\nIf *Shèngxiān* (勝先) is the *Kuaìgāng* (魁罡) yin, with the *yang* above and *yin* below, then *Shèngxiān* (勝先) must be taken as the *use*.\n\nSuppose in the twelfth month, on a *Rénshēn* (壬申) day at dawn:\nIf *Kuaìgāng* (魁罡) is joined by *Rén* (壬), there is no mutual opposition;\nIf **yin** obtains *Xiǎojí* (小吉), there is no mutual opposition;\nIf *Zéi* (賊) and *Shèngxiān* (勝先) govern *Shēn* (申), with the *yang* above opposing the *yin* below, this is taken as the *use*.\n\nIf the **Marshal** (將) obtains *Tiānhòu* (天后), and the **Fire Deity** (火神) is also in the *Jīnxiāng* (金乡), this brings **worry**—women will be uneasy, as if pregnant but miscarrying or suffering injury.\n\nIf the **Marshal** (將) obtains *Tiāngāng* (天罡), and the **Marshal** (將) obtains *Shèngshé* (剩蛇), this brings **fear and terror**—this person in the eighth month will engage in disputes with women, causing mutual alarm.\n\nIf the **Marshal** (將) obtains *Gōngcāo* (功曹), and the **Marshal** (將) obtains *Liùhé* (六合) as **Heaven’s Gate** (天門), this brings **matters of secrecy, matchmaking, and brokering**.\n\nIf the **Marshal** (將) obtains *Liùhé* (六合) as **Heaven’s Gate** (天門), and the **Marshal** (將) obtains *Tiānguān* (天關), and passes through *Tiāngāng* (天梁), and encounters *Bái Hǔ* (白虎), this will bring **worry of death and mourning**.\n\nIf a person encounters **closed barriers** (閉遮), **movements and relocations** (出入移徙), **women fleeing** (婦女逃亡), or **disquiet reaching the county magistrate** (不安至縣官), it is a cause for concern.\n\nIf the **Marshal** (將) obtains three *transmissions* (傳) and three *fires* (火), this brings **worry of losing property to fire, killing others, sudden thunderstrikes, or disputes**.\n\nThe **auspicious period** (吉期) is determined by what the *use* generates, while the **inauspicious period** (凶期) is determined by what it fears.\n\nIf *Gōngcāo* (功曹) is the *use*, then joy lies in *Bǐng-Dīng* (丙丁), while misfortune lies in *Gēng-Xīn* (庚辛).\n\nIf the *use* arises from a **yang hour-pillar** (陽辰), then the **worry** will be **repurposed by others** (事廢他人);\nIf the *use* arises from a **yang hour-pillar** (陽辰) for a **future matter** (方來), but is in an **yin hour-pillar** (陰辰), then the **worry** will **manifest in oneself** (忧起己身).\n\nIf the **Marshal** (將) encounters *Zǐ* (子), the **Mother** (母) will be a savior;\nIf the **Marshal** (將) encounters *Guǐ Lì* (鬼吏), this is a **sign of double calamity** (重凶).\n\nIf the *use* contains a **faint breath of qi** (微氣), and if the **Divine Marshal** (神將) overcomes the **inauspicious** (凶者), this also signifies **salvation**.\n\nIf the *use* obtains the **orphan** (孤) of the *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) as **Firstborn** (元子), or the **void** (虚) of the *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) as **First Husband** (元夫), then:\nIf the *use* is overcome by **Kingly Qi** (王氣), this is **worry of the county magistrate** (法忧縣官);\nIf it is overcome by **Affinity Qi** (相氣), this is **worry of money and resources** (法忧錢財);\nIf it is overcome by **Auspicious Qi** (休氣), this is **worry of illness** (法忧疾病);\nIf it is overcome by **Confinement Qi** (囚氣), this is **worry of imprisonment and entanglements** (法忧囚徒構系);\nIf it is overcome by **Death Qi** (死氣), this is **worry of death and mourning** (法忧死丧).\n\nThe **family tomb** (家墓) and **auspicious qi** (休) bring **worry for elders** (老人);\n**Kingly Qi** (王氣) and **Affinity Qi** (相氣) bring **worry for strong young men** (丁壮).\n**Metal overcoming Wood** (金克木) brings **broken bones and injuries** (折傷);\n**Wood overcoming Earth** (木克土) brings **boils and abscesses** (痈腫);\n**Earth overcoming Water** (土克水) brings **internal blockage and stagnation** (內閉不通);\n**Water overcoming Fire** (水克火) brings **loss of vision** (失明);\n**Fire overcoming Metal** (火克金) brings **fear, loss of breath, or madness** (驚恐、失氣、狂).\n\nThe *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) are always considered **void and empty** (虚衝) for *Wù-Jǐ* (戊己).\n\nThe Second Canon states:\nWithin the **day-pillar** and **hour-pillar**, if there are two mutual oppositions between **yin** and **yang**, first take the **lower overcoming the upper** (下克上) as the *use*;\nIf the **upper overcomes the lower** (上克下), it is **顺** (顺);\nIf the **lower overcomes the upper** (下克上), it is **逆** (逆).\n\n**逆** (逆) brings **worry of internal difficulties that are hard to resolve** (忧探在內難解);\n**顺** (顺) brings **worry of external difficulties that are easy to resolve** (忧浅在外易解).\n\nThis is why one must examine the *use* and discern the subtle differences between **auspicious** and **inauspicious**.\n\nSuppose in the second month, on a *Wùzǐ* (戊子) hour at dawn, with *Mǎo* (卯) added:\nIf the **Divine Marshal** (神後) governs *Wù* (戊), and *Xū* (戌) is hosted by *Bǐng* (丙), with the **lower overcoming the upper** (下克上) and **yin** obtaining *Xiǎojí* (小吉),\nIf the **upper overcomes the lower** (上克下) and the *transmission* (傳) obtains *Gōngcāo* (功曹),\nAll cases are **upper overcoming the lower** (上克下), so the **Divine Marshal** (神後) must be taken as the *use*.\n\nSuppose in a *Rénchén* (壬辰) year on the New Year’s Day:\nIf *Xiǎojí* (小吉) is joined by *Rén* (壬), with the **upper overcoming the lower** (上克下), then the **Divine Marshal** (神後) must be taken as the *use*.\n\nThe *Zhōuyì* (周易) takes the **world** (世) as the diviner, while the **body** (身) relies on the *use* (用) as the diviner, and the **body** (身) distinguishes between **auspicious** and **inauspicious**.\n\n**Metal entering Wood** (金入木) brings **injury to others** (傷人者也), and **worry of disputes reaching the county magistrate** (忧斗讼至县官).\n**Wood entering Metal** (木入金) brings **worry for women reaching the county magistrate** (忧女人至县官).\n**Water entering Earth** (水入土) brings **worry of lost or abandoned money and resources** (忧亡遺錢財).\n**Earth entering Water** (土入水) brings **worry of disputes over cloth** (忧斗争布帛).\n**Wood entering Earth** (木入土) brings **worry of imprisonment, disputes, or entanglements with money and resources** (忧牢狱、口舌、财物系伤).\n**Earth entering Wood** (土入木) brings **worry for men with serious illness, or the need for ancestral sacrifices** (忧男子持重疾病、欲祠杞).\n**Metal entering Fire** (金入火) brings **worry of outsiders deceiving and exploiting** (忧外人相欺给).\n**Fire entering Metal** (火入金) brings **disputes between two women and one man** (两女子、一男子有口舌).\n**Fire entering Water** (火入水) brings **worry of women being alarmed by officials or disputes** (忧女子惊吏斗讼).\n**Water entering Fire** (水入火) brings **fear and childbirth-related illness** (惊恐有产病).\n\nOther cases follow this pattern.\n\nSuppose in the first month, on a *Yǐwèi* (乙巳) hour at dawn, with *Wèi* (未) added:\nIf the *transmission* (傳送) is joined by *Yǐ* (乙), with the **upper overcoming the lower** (上克下), and the **Divine Marshal** (神後) governs *Shēn* (申) as the *transmission* (傳送) yin, there is no mutual opposition.\nIf *Kuaìgāng* (魁罡) is joined by *Jǐ* (己), with the **lower overcoming the upper** (下克上) as the *use*, and the **Marshal** (將) obtains *Liùhé* (六合), this brings **matters of secrecy** (主阴私之事).」\n\n「If *Kuaìgāng* (魁罡) is overcome by the lower, then slaves and servants follow suit, and the matter will involve grave worries, with hidden plots and betrayals.\n\nIf the *use* (用) arises from a lowly person, and is also overcome by conflicting *qi* (气), then disputes over wealth and property will ensue.\n\nIf the *transmission* (传) secures **Great Auspiciousness** (大吉), and ends at **Supreme Unity** (太一), then there will be talk of battles, injuries, and even death. Why so? Because the *use* (用) originates from the three *Jīn* (金), ending at **Supreme Unity** (太一), while the **Marshal** (将) secures **White Tiger** (白虎). This is to be discerned by intention.\n\nOther cases follow this pattern.\n\nThe **Third Canon** (第三经) states: In the *Yīn-Yáng* (阴阳) of day and hour, there may be two instances of the lower overcoming the upper, or two instances of the upper overcoming the lower. First, the one that aligns with the day is taken as the *use* (用), meaning one must secure the day’s *qi* (气) to fulfill its purpose. This is called the **double overcoming** (重相克), where the one aligning with the day is chosen, as it involves two *uses* (用). The *comparison* (比), being near, means the worry lies within; the *non-comparison* (不比), being distant, means there are enmities. Thus, one must secure the *comparison* (比) with the day, for it pertains to bandits, thieves, or lost persons within the household.\n\nSuppose in the first month, on a *Xīnhài* (辛亥) day, with the hour of *Mǎo* (卯) at dawn, **Victory Before** (胜先) added by *Xīn* (辛), **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) added by *Hài* (亥). Here, there are two instances of the upper overcoming the lower. **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) aligns with *Xīn* (辛), with no *Xīnwù* (辛丑) but *Xīnwèi* (辛未) present, so **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) should be the *use* (用).\n\nSuppose in the second month, on a *Bǐngwǔ* (丙午) hour, with *Wèi* (未) added, **Transmission** (传送) added by *Bǐng* (丙), and *Kuaìgāng* (魁罡) added by *Wǔ* (午). Here, there are two instances of the lower overcoming the upper. **Transmission** (传送) aligns with *Bǐng* (丙), with no *Bǐngyǒu* (丙酉) but *Bǐngshēn* (丙申) present, so **Transmission** (传送) should be the *use* (用).\n\nFor **Yang days** (刚日), if the *use* (用) secures **Wood** (木), there will be worries about official documents and litigation. If it secures **Fire** (火), there will be worries about fields, houses, and disputes. If it secures **Wood** (木), there will be worries about officials and malevolent spirits. If it secures **Metal** (金), there will be worries about relocation, instability, and weapons. If it secures **Water** (水), there will be worries about women bearing heavy burdens, or even death. If **Water** (水) is secured in the *use* (用) on a **Yang day** (卯日), there will be worries about wooden objects, ships, and carriages, or theft. If **Water** (水) is secured, there will be worries about battles, breaches, and bloodshed. If **Earth** (土) is secured, there will be worries about wealth and grains. If **Metal** (金) is secured, there will be worries about livestock. If **Fire** (火) is secured, there will be worries about women being conscripted, or internal discord through jealousy.\n\nSuppose in the first month, on a *Rénchén* (壬辰) hour, with *Chén* (辰) added, **Victory Before** (胜先) governs *Rén* (壬), with the lower overcoming the upper; **Ascending Brightness** (登明) added by *Chén* (辰), again with the lower overcoming the upper. This is said because there is no *Rénhài* (壬亥) but *Rénwǔ* (壬午) exists, so **Victory Before** (胜先) should be the *use* (用). If the *qi* (气) of **Old Age** (老气) is overcome, then there will be worries about illness.\n\nIf **Fire enters Water** (火入水), and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Heavenly Mother** (天后), then the matter will involve women.\n\nIf the *transmission* (传) meets **Great Auspiciousness** (大吉) and aligns with **Hooked Array** (勾陈), then there will be worries about battles.\n\nIf the *end* (终) aligns with **Transmission** (传送) governing entry and exit, and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Three Dark Turtles** (三玄武), then there will be talk of distant travels with losses.\n\nIf **Transmission** (传送) is added by *Chǒu* (丑), meaning the lower governs its grave, then there will be worries of sorrow, displeasure, joyful dreams of the dead, or encounters with widows and the lonely.\n\nIf **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) secures **Divine Marshal** (神后) and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Heavenly Void** (天空), then a woman will plot to deceive her husband, harboring two hearts.\n\nIf the *end* (终) aligns with **Supreme Unity** (太一) and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Heavenly Mother** (天后), then there will be grave worries about women.\n\nIf the *use* (用) is overcome by **Royal Qi** (王气), then there will be worries about officials, with the threat of military action, enmities, and mutual harm. This is because Fire adds to Water.\n\nOther cases follow this pattern.\n\nThe **Fourth Canon** (第四经) states: In the *Yīn-Yáng* (阴阳) of day and hour, if there are two *comparisons* (比), then the one that first enters and causes deeper harm is taken as the *use* (用). This is what is called **observing the subtle and discerning the mechanism** (察其微，见其机). The phrase **rising at Seasonal Pivot and Midpoint** (起季仲) refers to the subtle, while **in the First Month** (在孟) refers to the mechanism. The **mechanism** (机) means worries of probing; the **subtle** (微) means worries of shallowness, indicating ease of passage.\n\nSuppose in the eighth month, on a **Yīzhēn** (甲申) day at dawn, **Heavenly Marshal** (天罡) added by *Jiǎ* (甲), with the lower overcoming the upper; **Divine Marshal** (神后) governs *Shēn* (申) as the **River Marshal** (河魁), with the lower overcoming the upper. This means **Heavenly Marshal** (天罡) and **Divine Marshal** (神后) are both overcome by the lower. Again, they both align with *Jiǎ* (甲), as there is also *Jiǎzǐ* (甲子). **Heavenly Marshal** (天罡) is **Earth added by *Jiǎ*** (土加甲), first entering the **Wood domain** (木乡), causing harm akin to probing, thus being the **mechanism** (机). **Divine Marshal** (神后) governs *Xū* (戌) and turns to enter the **Water domain** (水乡), being the **subtle** (微), so **Heavenly Marshal** (天罡) should be the *use* (用).\n\nSuppose in the seventh month, on a **Yīzǐ** (甲子) day, with the hour of *Hài* (亥) added, **Transmission** (传送) added by *Jiǎ* (甲), with the upper overcoming the lower; **Old Age** (老气) secures **Functionary** (功曹), with the lower overcoming the upper; **Victory Before** (胜先) governs *Zǐ* (子), with the lower overcoming the upper; and **Old Age** (老气) secures **Divine Marshal** (神后), with the upper overcoming the lower. All these align with the day, and **Victory Before** (胜先) progresses through *Gǒu* (癸) to *Chǒu* (丑), while **Functionary** (功曹) is at *Gēngyǒu* (庚酉) and *Xīn* (辛) causes deeper harm, so **Functionary** (功曹) should be the *use* (用). This is called **advancing and retreating without proper measure**, with grave worries.\n\nIn the first month, on a *Xīnyǒu* (辛酉) hour, with *Wǔ* (午) added, **Great Pivot** (太冲) governs *Xīn* (辛), with the lower overcoming the upper; **Transmission** (传送) is the **Old Age** (老气) of **Great Pivot** (太冲) and governs *Mǎo* (卯), with the upper overcoming the lower; **Functionary** (功曹) added by *Yǒu* (酉), with the lower overcoming the upper; and **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) is the **Functionary** (功曹), with **Old Age** (老气) added by *Yín* (寅), again with the lower overcoming the upper. Both **Great Pivot** (太冲) and **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) are overcome by the lower, and they both align with *Xīn* (辛). **Great Pivot** (太冲) progresses through *Xīn* (辛) to *Xū* (戌), causing shallow harm; **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) first enters the **Wood domain** (木乡), causing slight harm. Thus, **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) should be the *use* (用). This is called **glimpsing one’s enemy and gazing upon their mound**. **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) governs women, and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Victorious Snake** (胜蛇), bringing worries of death, women, fear, and strange blood on birth days. If **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) passes **Bundle North** (束北), then the **Ghost Gate** (鬼门) will see ghosts.\n\nIf **Transmission** (传) secures **Divine Marshal** (神后) and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Heavenly Emptiness** (天空), then a woman will seek to deceive her husband, harboring two hearts.\n\nIf the *end* (终) aligns with **Supreme Unity** (太一) and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Heavenly Mother** (天后), then there will be grave worries about women.\n\nIf the *use* (用) is overcome by **Royal Qi** (王气), then there will be worries about officials, with the threat of military action, enmities, and mutual harm. This is because Fire adds to Water.\n\nOther cases follow this pattern.\n\nThe **Fifth Canon** (第五经) states: In the *Yīn-Yáng* (阴阳) of day and hour, if there is no mutual opposition, then the one that is distantly opposed to the day’s *qi* (气) is taken as the *use* (用). This is called **interacting without mutual opposition, entering from an independent source** (交俱不相克，入从独立者). Here, there is one **Divine Marshal** (神后) residing in the yin, opposing the day. If the day progresses to overcome the **Divine Marshal** (神后) in the yin, then the **Divine Marshal** (神后) will come to oppose the day, causing worries from outside. If the day progresses to overcome the **Divine Marshal** (神后), then there will be enmities arising internally, with hopes of distant people who do not come. Though the hour may have distant opposition, it does not qualify as the *use* (用). The *use* (用) is determined by the day, not the hour. Suppose in the fourth month, on a *Xīnyǒu* (辛酉) hour, with *Jǐ* (己) added, and **Great Auspiciousness** (大吉) added by *Xīn* (辛), with no mutual opposition; **Old Age** (老气) secures **Heavenly Marshal** (天罡), with no opposition; **Divine Marshal** (神后) added by *Yǒu* (酉), with no opposition; and **Old Age** (老气) secures **Great Pivot** (太冲), all without mutual opposition. *Xīn* (辛) distantly opposes **Great Pivot** (太冲), so it should be the *use* (用).\n\nSuppose in the fifth month, on a *Jiǎwǔ* (甲午) hour, with *Xū* (戌) added, and **Ascending Brightness** (登明) added by *Jiǎ* (甲), with no mutual opposition;」\n\n「The *transmission* (传送) is **Ascending Brightness** (登明) and **Yin** (阴), with no mutual opposition. **Great Pivot** (太冲) adds **Wǔ** (午), with no opposition; **Yin** (阴) secures **Divine Marshal** (神后), with no opposition. The four *lessons* (课) of **Yin** and **Yang** (阴阳) are all without mutual opposition.\n\nOnly the *transmission* (传送) distantly opposes *Jiǎ* (甲), so the *transmission* (传送) should be the **use** (用). If there are two distant oppositions occurring today, the comparison of the **use** (用) should still be based on the day.\n\nWhen **Heavenly One** (天一) moves in accordance with the *sequence* (顺行), if there is a **minister** (臣) who cannot be restrained, it brings anxiety about males and illnesses. When it moves contrary to the *sequence* (逆行), father and son cannot be close, and it brings anxiety about females. When there is **Guest** (客) in the *sequence* (行), one must not harbor deceitful or treacherous intent within; disaster will come from the southwest, with troops entering the gate and causing injury and bloodshed. Be cautious not to travel southwest.\n\nAll these are spoken in terms of **Divine Generals** (神将). There are **arcbalds** (魁罡) and **White Tiger** (白虎) plotting mutual harm, and **Black Tortoise** (玄武) as the thief.\n\nIn the first month, *Jǐwèi* (己卯) hour adds *Yín* (寅): **Heavenly Marshal** (天罡) adds *Jǐ* (己), with no opposition; **Yin** (阴) secures **Great Auspiciousness** (大吉), with no opposition; **Divine Marshal** (神后) adds *Wèi* (卯), with no opposition; **Yin** (阴) secures **From Arcbald** (从魁), with no opposition. The four *lessons* (课) of **Yin** and **Yang** (阴阳) are all without mutual opposition. Only *Jǐ* (己) distantly opposes **Divine Marshal** (神后), so **Divine Marshal** (神后) should be the **use** (用).\n\nAccording to the **Law Lord** (法主), the woman will be in harmony with her husband, and there will be matters of **noble persons** (贵人) summoning or enlisting her. Additionally, she will be overcome by the **deceased** (死者), bringing anxiety about the dead, and the rest will involve **family litigation** (家讼) and **family tombs** (家墓). The rest follow this pattern.\n\nThe sixth canon states: Within the **Yin** and **Yang** (阴阳) of day and hour, there is no mutual opposition, nor any distant opposition. When **Yang** (刚) ascends and **Yin** (柔) descends, the **Pleiades** (昴星) determines the **use** (用). This is called **day and hour repetition** (日辰重), for it encompasses all **uses** (用者).\n\nFor **Yang** days, the **Earthly Pleiades** (地昴星) above should be used to determine the **use** (神). For **Yin** days, the hour of the **Celestial Pleiades** (天上昴星) should be used to determine the **use**.\n\nThe **Pleiades** (昴星) signifies **closure and obstruction** (闭塞). Those who travel will be delayed, lingering at home, facing **afflictions** (忧患).\n\nOn **Yang** days, men who travel far will not return, fearing they may die in battle abroad. On **Yin** days, hidden women will be **lewd and licentious** (淫泱), causing deep anxiety that never resolves.\n\nIn the second month, during the *Wù* (戊) and *Zǐ* (子) hour, **Yang** (寅) is added: **Great Auspiciousness** (大吉) is added to *Wù* (戊), with no opposition; **Yin** (阴) secures **From Arcbald** (从魁), with no opposition; **Transmission** (传送) is added to *Zǐ* (子), with no opposition; **Law Lord** (天罡) is **Transmission** (传送), and **Yin** (阴) does not oppose it. The four *lessons* (课) are all without mutual opposition, nor is there any distant opposition today. *Wù* (戊) is **Yang** (刚), *Yáng* (仰) is **Ascendant** (昂). The **Pleiades** (昴星) above obtains **Great Unity** (太一), which should be the **use**.\n\nTravelers may resume their journey.\n\nIn the ninth month, during the *Yǐ* (乙) and *Wèi* (未) hour, **Divine Marshal** (辰) is added: **Supreme Pivot** (太冲) is added to *Yǐ* (乙), with no opposition; **Yin** secures **Functionary** (功曹), with no opposition; **Victory** (胜先) is added to *Wèi* (未), with no opposition; **Yin** secures **Great Unity** (太一), with no opposition.\n\nOn a *Yǐ* (乙) and *Yǒu* (酉) day, **Yin** (阴) observes the **Celestial Pleiades** (天上), and the hour it transits should be the **use**. Travelers should halt and conceal themselves. If they do not come, those at home will not wish to see others.\n\nThus, this method is used to determine all **uses**. If used to decide **auspiciousness or inauspiciousness** (吉凶), it does not apply to the final outcome.\n\nIn the first month, during the *Wù* (戊) *Yín* (寅) hour, *Wèi* (未) is added: **From Arc** (从魁) is added to *Wù* (戊), with no opposition; **Yin** secures **Great Auspiciousness** (大吉), with no opposition; **Victory** (胜先) is added to *Yín* (寅), with no opposition; **Yin** secures **River Arc** (河魁), with no opposition.\n\nOn a *Wù* (戊) *Jiāng* (刚) day, the **Celestial Pleiades** (天上) displays **Great Auspiciousness**; this should be the **use**. Travelers should halt at distant passes and gates.\n\nWhen **Celestial Unity** (天一) is obtained, the **Six Gates** (六之门) are established, and divination reveals that nobles will not be secure in their offices, while commoners will face divisions.\n\nThis is a *Jiāng* (刚) day.\n\nIn the first month, during the *Jǐ* (己) *Chǒu* (丑) hour, **Ghost** (鬼) is added: **Arc** (魁) is added to *Jǐ* (己), with no opposition; **Yin** secures **Great Auspiciousness**, with no opposition; **Divine Marshal** (天罡) is added to *Chǒu* (丑), with no opposition; **Yin** secures **Lesser Auspiciousness** (小吉), with no opposition; and there is no distant opposition.\n\nOn a *Jǐ* (己) *Yǒu* (酉) day, the **Celestial Pleiades** (天上) transits over *Chén* (辰) and *Wǔ* (午); **Victory** (胜先) should be the **use**, and **Celestial Void** (天空) will be obtained.\n\nThis follows the same principle.\n\nThe **Seventh Canon** states:\n*\"When Heaven and Earth reunite, it is called 'Yín' (吟).*\n*If all deities return to their homes, the four celestial stems do not oppose each other.*\n*On a *Jiāng* (刚) day, the day-stem deity is the **use**;*\n*On a *Yǒu* (酉) day, the hour-stem deity is the **use**.*\n*This is called the reversal of **Yin-Yang** at the passes and gates.*\n*Thus, there is no need for selection.\"*\n\nFor instance, if today is a *Jiǎ* (甲) *Jiāng* (刚) day:\n**Virtue** (德) resides in **Yang**, so the day-stem deity is the **use**.\n\nIf today is a *Yǐ* (乙) *Yǒu* (酉) day:\n**Virtue** (德) resides in **Yin**, so the hour-stem deity is the **use**.\n\nThis is because **Yin** and **Yang** *qi* harmonize.\nAt this time, one should not travel or undertake affairs, as they will not succeed.\nFor divining **auspiciousness or inauspiciousness**, it concerns those already abroad, those about to relocate, or those merging and separating. Observe the **use deity**—if it is **executed**, the **use** is transmitted; if it is **self-executed**, its **void** is applied.\n\nFor example, if today is *Jiǎ* (甲) *Zǐ* (子), **Functionary** (功曹) transiting over *Jiǎ* (甲) is the **use**.\n**Functionary** executes *Jǐ* (己), encountering **Supreme Unity** (太一), which executes *Jiǎ* (甲), ultimately revealing **Transmission** (传送).\n\n**Auspiciousness or inauspiciousness** is all determined by the **deity-general** (神将):\nOn a *Jiāng* (刚) day,\n- **Wood Deity** (木神) transiting over **Wood**, portends worries over documents and wooden implements; men wish to travel far.\n- **Fire Deity** (火神) transiting over **Fire**, brings men and women into legal disputes reaching the county magistrate.\n- **Metal Deity** (金神) transiting over **Metal**, portends worries over relocation and divisions.\n- **Earth Deity** (土神) transiting over **Earth**, portends worries over distant summons from nobles.\n- **Water Deity** (水神) transiting over **Water**, brings noblemen’s drinking.\n\nOn a **Yin** (柔) day,\n- **Wood Deity** (木神) added to **Wood**, portends worries over boats and carts reaching the county magistrate.\n- **Fire Deity** (火神) added to **Fire**, portends worries over women’s infidelity and lawsuits over dwellings.\n- **Metal Deity** (金神) added to **Metal**, portends worries over relocation and divisions.\n- **Earth Deity** (土神) added to **Earth**, portends worries over women, lawsuits over fields and residences, and divisions.\n- **Water Deity** (水神) added to **Water**, portends worries over lost property, failed theft apprehensions, family loss, and not crossing borders.\n\nThis follows the same principle.\n\nThe **Eighth Canon** states:\n*\"**Great Auspiciousness** slays *Yǐ* (乙).\"*\n\nThe **Wu-Ji-Xin-Ren** days (戊己辛壬), when paired with **Zi-Wu-Mao-You** hours (子午卯酉), are the **Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth**, returning calamity to the **Nine Homeless** (九丑). The **Nine Homeless** refers to the five stems and four branches combining into nine.\n\n**Great Auspiciousness** (大吉) constantly occupies the **Great Kill** (大杀) above, and its killing is thus called **Homeless** (丑). When the four **Companion** days (四仲) are added to the four **Companion** hours, and **Great Auspiciousness** transits over the day-hour, undertaking all affairs is **greatly inauspicious**.\n\nWhen **Great Auspiciousness** is added to the day, it harms the elder; when added to the hour, it harms the younger. On **Yang** days, it harms men; on **You** days (酉), it harms women. When the day is in **Yang**, it injures husbands; when in **Yin**, it injures wives. Double **Yin** harms fathers; double **Yin** harms mothers.\n\n**Heaven One** (天一) before is **Yang**; **Heaven One** after is **Yin**. All days and hours before **Heaven One** are **double Yang**; all days and hours after **Heaven One** are **double Yin**.\n\nUsing the **Four Seasons’ qi** as the **King’s Minister** for three years, and as **Imprisonment and Death** for three months. Using **Great Auspiciousness** in conjunction to describe its form: when the four branches align with the **Great Auspiciousness**, it is **greatly auspicious**; when aligned with inauspiciousness, like adding **Nine Homeless**, it is **greatly inauspicious**, with heavy calamity—certain misfortune, executions, death, bloodshed across thousands of *li*, and none escaping.\n\nThe **Canon** states: *Yǐ* (乙) is the beginning of thunder and lightning; *Wu-Ji* (戊己) are the days when **Beidou** (北辰) descends. *Xin* (辛) marks the beginning of autumn executions, a day when the **Three Lights** (王日月三光) do not shine, a day of no merit. The **Four Companion** hours are the days of life and death for all things. **Great Auspiciousness** is where the **day, moon, and five stars** begin. Thus, their conjunction brings harm.\n\nFor example, in the second month, if *Ren-Zi* (壬子) hour is added to *You* (酉), and **Great Auspiciousness** transits over *Zi* (子), a **Yang** day, the eldest son will be killed, with the term falling on *Wu-Chen* (戊辰), *Wu-Xu* (戊戌), *Ji-Wei* (己未), and *Ji-Chou* (己丑). This is because **Water** (王水) harms **Earth** (土), so **Earth** days and **Earth** months are the terms. In the four seasons, when **Earth** month and hour are added to *You* (酉), it is the **Four Companion** hour. **Great Auspiciousness** added to *Zi* (子) is adding to a **Yang** hour, and the younger son bears it. In the second month, the **Great Hour** is in *Zi* (子) of spring, and **Earth** is dead. This is **great inauspiciousness**; next, determine who bears it.\n\nUsing **Great Auspiciousness** in conjunction to describe its effects:\n- **Tai-Yin** (太阴) in conjunction brings **sacrificial rites and ghostly disturbances**, causing **Tengshe** (腾蛇) to fail or sudden death;\n- **Zhuque** (朱雀) in conjunction brings **clerical errors or burning deaths**;\n- **Liuhe** (六合) in conjunction brings **women’s infidelity, wet-nursing, and illegitimate births**;\n- **Gouchen** (勾陈) in conjunction brings **clustered deaths**;\n- **Qinglong** (青龙) in conjunction brings **surplus food, drink, money, and wealth**;\n- **Tianyi** (天一) in conjunction brings **shared worries with nobles**;\n- **Tianhou** (天后) in conjunction brings **women bearing another man’s child**;\n- **Xuanwu** (玄武) in conjunction brings **theft, livestock failures, and disasters**;\n- **Taichang** (太常) in conjunction brings **women losing fields, residences, and property**;\n- **Baihu** (白虎) in conjunction brings **death and funeral disasters**;\n- **Tiankong** (天空) in conjunction brings **theft, deception, and fraud**.\n\nIn the eleventh month, if *Yi-Mao* (乙卯) hour is added to *Chen* (辰), **Great Auspiciousness** added to *Yi* (乙) is in use. Obtaining **She** (蛇), with **transmission** reaching three **Earths**, worries over women and disputes over fields and residences fall upon the eldest daughter.\n\nIn the eighth month, if *Wu-Zi* (戊子) hour is added to *Mao* (卯), **Great Auspiciousness** added to *Zi* (子), with **Yin-Functionary** (阴功曹) in use, though **Great Auspiciousness** is not in use, it is still **Nine Homeless**, harming the younger son. **Great Auspiciousness** disturbs tombs and ancestral graves. Follow this principle.\n\nThe **Ninth Canon** states:\n*\"All systems say divination for affairs: when the hour travels forward to add to the day above, and the lower overpowers the upper as in use, it is said to hold its own while advancing upon others—like a son-in-law with malicious intent. For example, if today is *Jia-Xu* (甲戌), and **He-Kui** (河魁) transits over *Jia* (甲), *Yi-Wei* (乙未) is **Lesser Auspiciousness**; transiting over *Yi* (乙), *Bing-Shen* (丙申) is **Transmission**; added to *Bing* (丙), *Jia-Chen* (甲辰) is **Heavenly Gang** (天罡); added to *Jia* (甲), *Yi-Chou* (乙丑) is **Great Auspiciousness**. Transiting over *Yi* (乙), this is the hour added to the day, and the lower overpowers the upper. Using this to divine auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, the younger harms the elder, the household clashes, internal and external infidelity, and the **Dao/Way of internal chaos**. Ministers plot against their lords, sons scheme against their fathers, and slaves conspire against their masters.\n\nAnother method:\n- **He-Kui** (河魁) added to *Jia* (甲) brings **executions, lawsuits over hills and valleys**.\n- **Lesser Auspiciousness** (小吉) added to *Yi* (乙) brings worries over women and food/drink.\n- **Tai-Yi** (太一) added to *Gui* (癸) brings lawsuits over clothing.\n- *Hai* (亥) added to *Ji* (己) brings women competing over money.\n- **From He-Kui** (从魁) added to *Ding* (丁) brings disputes over divisions.\n- **Victory First** (胜先) added to *Ren* (壬) brings lawsuits over fields and residences, women, and sudden fires.\n- **Shenhou** (神后) added to *Xu* (戌) brings women dying from illness or washing.\n- Obtaining **Tianhou** (天后) brings infidelity among relatives.\n\nIt is also said: In the second month, if *Jia-Xu* (甲戌) hour is added to *Yin* (寅), **He-Kui** and the **Moon Deity** (月神) are in conjunction, *Wei* (未) is not added to *Jia* (甲), the lower overpowers the upper—auspicious. Yet there is still infidelity and chaos. Obtaining **Zhuque** (朱雀) brings internal accusations;\n\nThe **Gouchen** (勾陈) brings internal betrayal and harm among relatives;\nThe **Baihu** (白虎) brings mutual slaughter.\n\nObtaining **Tiankong** (天空) makes one wish to become a son-in-law by marriage;\nObtaining **Tianhou** (天后) brings infidelity and illicit affairs.\n\nThe **Tenth Canon** (第十经) states:\n*\"Closed mouth, closed mouth\"*—the **Yin** (阴) is behind you.\n\nCounting four backward and matching—this refers to reckoning from **Shenhou** (神后) in reverse to **Congkui** (从魁), aligning with the **Choushen** (丑神) to harmonize **Yin** and **Yang** (阴阳).\n\nIf a man dies, blame the **Yin** (阴);\nIf a woman dies, blame the **Yang** (阳).\nThe initial position of the deceased is their **starting point** (亡人位),\nAnd their final resting place is their **native soil** (乡).\n\nFor those imprisoned or dead nearby, **He-Kui** (合丑) is close;\nFor those who die far away, **Wangxiang** (王相) is distant.\nExcessive **Yin** (重阴) does not emerge—\nUse **San** (参) and **Fan-yin** (反吟) to reverse the count.\n\nIf the deceased returns to **Yang** (归阳),\nOr if thieves are exposed from **Yin** (发阴),\nThis is due to the **Xuanwu** (玄武).\n\nHere, the six **Gui** (癸) branches are **Yin** (阴),\nAnd the six **Jia** (甲) branches are **Yang** (阳).\n\nFor instance, if **Gongcao** (功曹) is **Xuanwu** (玄武),\nThe **Yin** (阴) is in **Dengming** (登明);\nIf **Tianxiang** (天罡) is **Xuanwu** (玄武),\nThe **Yin** (阴) is in **Daji** (大吉).\n\nThis is called the **Yin-Yang polarity of the six Jia branches at the beginning and end of the Canon** (六甲旬头尾阴阳).\n\nFor example, if in the **First Month** (正月), **Gengzi** (庚子) hour is added to **Chen** (辰),\nAnd **Tianxiang** (天罡) is **Xuanwu** (玄武),\nThen the **Yin** (阴) obtains **Dengming** (登明).\n\nTo know who the thief is:\nObserve the **deity** (神) above **Geng** (庚) and see if it aligns with **Taichong** (太冲).\n**Taichong** (太冲) is **Wood** (木),\nWhich grows from **Hai** (亥)—\nThus, the thief is a relative.\n\nIn the **Ninth Month** (九月), if **Dingwei** (丁巳) hour is added to **Chou** (丑),\n**Congkui** (从魁) is **Tianyī** (天一) added to **Wei** (未),\nAnd **Shenhou** (神后) is **Xuanwu** (玄武) added to **Xu** (戌).\nIf a woman dies at the **west-north gate** (西北门),\nBlame the **Earth** (地);\nIf a man dies, blame **Congkui** (从魁) added to **Wei** (未)—\nBlame the **Wei** (未) **Earth** (地).\n\nThis is the **Four Reversals of Epidemics** (疫四逆),\nAnd the **Four Deities to be blamed** (责四神).\n\nFor **You** (酉) **Six** (六) and **Wei** (未) **Eight** (八),\nSix times eight equals **48 li** (里).\nIf a woman dies, blame **Shenhou** (神后);\nIf **Shenhou** (神后) is added to **Xu** (戌),\n**Xu** (戌) **Five** (五) and **Zi** (子) **Nine** (九),\nFive times nine equals **45 li** (里).\n\n**Wangqi** (王气) is doubled,\n**Xiangqi** (相气) is multiplied tenfold,\n**Xiuqi** (休气) is doubled,\n**Qiuqi** (囚气) is halved—\nCount as such for **deadly qi** (死气).\n\nIn the **First Month** (正月), if **Jiazi** (甲子) hour is added to **Mao** (卯),\n**Tianxiang** (天罡) is **Xuanwu** (玄武) added to **Shen** (申),\nThen **Tianxiang** (天罡) is **Yang** (阳).\nIf **Yin** (阴) is in **Daji** (大吉) added to **Ji** (己),\nA man dies bound in the **south** (南)—\nSearch for him in the **Wei** (巳) **Earth** (地);\nIf a woman dies in the **southwest** (西南),\nSearch for her in the **Shen** (申) **Earth** (地).\n\n**\"Closed-Mouth\" (闭口者):**\nThe Yellow Emperor speaks of another’s hidden *yin* secrets, hence the term \"Closed-Mouth.\"\n\nThe **Six Jia** (六甲) as *yang*:\n- **Jiazi** (甲子) – *Shenhou* (神后)\n- **Jiaxu** (甲戌) – *Hekui* (河魁)\n- **Jia申** – *Chuansong* (传送)\n- **Jiamu** (甲午) – *Shengxian* (胜先)\n- **Jichen** (甲辰) – *Tianxiang* (天罡)\n- **Jialei** (甲寅) – *Gongcao* (功曹)\n\nThese six *Jia* branches are the *yang* of **Xuanwu** (玄武); their corresponding **six Gui** (癸) branches are its *yin*.\n\n- **Jiazi** (甲子) decan contains **Guiyou** (癸酉), which follows *Hekui* (河魁).\n- **Jiaxu** (甲戌) decan contains **Guiwei** (癸未) – *Xiaoji* (小吉).\n- **Jia申** decan contains **GuiSi** (癸巳) – *Taiyi* (太一).\n- **Jiamu** (甲午) decan contains **GuiMao** (癸卯) – *Taichong* (太冲).\n- **Jichen** (甲辰) decan contains **GuiChou** (癸丑) – *Daji* (大吉).\n- **Jialei** (甲寅) decan contains **GuiHai** (癸亥) – *Dengming* (登明).\n\nThese six **Gui** branches are the *yin* of **Xuanwu**.\nThe text is profound and difficult—its four directions are verified through this.\n\n---\n**Chapter of *Yuheng* (玉衡) – *Tianyiyiliuren* (天一六壬) – First Principle:**\n\n*\"The use of *wuqi* (物气) aligns with today’s elemental kindred—regardless of other factors, observe whether it is near or distant. This means:\nWhat is born is *itself*; what dies is *wu* (物).\n\nFor example, if today is **Jia-Yi** (甲乙) Wood,\n**Dengming** (登明) as *wuqi* is auspicious—*shengshi* (生事).\n**Xiaoji** (小吉) as *wuqi* is inauspicious—*wu* (物) brings death to all things.\n\n**Hai-Mao-Wei** (亥卯未) are all Wood—\nWood is born in **Hai** (亥), dies in **Wei** (未).\nRegardless of other factors,\nIf **Dengming** contains Wood, it is auspicious—*wuqi* is Wood, though Water may also be present.\nIf **Xiaoji** contains Wood, it is inauspicious—*wuqi* is Wood, though Fire or Earth may also be present.\n\n**Near or distant** refers to:\nIf *wuqi* arises from **Dengming**,\n**Dengming**’s Wood is the native’s brother—*Gongcao* (功曹) and *Taichong* (太冲) are close kin,\n**Xiaoji**’s Wood is distant—external uncles, external grandsons.\n\nFor auspicious matters, if *yin-yang* aligns with **Dengming**, it is auspicious.\nFor inauspicious matters, if *yin-chang* (阴肠) contains **Xiaoji**,\nAnd *wuqi* is used in harmony with today—\nIf compared to males, *yang* is used; if to females, *yin* is used—\nThis determines auspiciousness and inauspiciousness for all matters.\nCompare internally and externally—this is the closest kin.\nOther cases follow this principle.\n\n---\n**Second Principle:**\n\n*\"The beginning of birth and death are compared to today—\nIf they repel each other upon meeting, the new and old are known.\n\nFor example, if today is **Yi** (乙) *Hekui* (河魁) governing **Yi** (乙) as *wuqi*,\n*Hekui* contains Metal—west direction—this is the beginning of birth.\nIf today is **Yi** (乙) *Daji* (大吉) governing **Yi** (乙) as *wuqi*,\n*Daji* contains death—Metal is death.\n\nToday’s comparison:\nThe Wood in **Yi** (乙) seeks to overcome *Hekui* (河魁),\nBut *Daji*’s Earth repels *Hekui*—\nThe Metal in *Daji* does not harmonize.\nThus, it is said:\n*‘If they repel upon meeting,’*\nIf *wuqi* arises from the beginning of birth, all matters are new—\nAuspiciousness and inauspiciousness are as divine as the *Shenjiang* (神将) speaks.\nIf *wuqi* arises from death, all matters are old.\n\nAncient customs—\nIf a man took a wife and later had relations with another,\nNow he wishes to reclaim her.\nIf he abandoned her and now wishes to return,\nOr if it is an old matter and he seeks it again—\n\nToday, **Ding** (丁) *Daji* (大吉) governs **Ding** (丁) as birth—*Tiancheng* (天呈) is death.\nToday, **Ji** (己) *Tiancheng* (天呈) governs **Ji** (己) as birth—*Xiaoji* (小吉) is death.\nToday, **Xin** (辛) *Xiaoji* (小吉) governs **Xin** (辛) as birth—*Hekui* (河魁) is death.\nToday, **Gui** (癸) *Daji* (大吉) governs **Gui** (癸) as birth—*Tianxiang* (天罡) is death.\n\n**Ding** (丁) contains Water—*Daji* (大吉).\n**Tianxiang** (天罡) also contains Water.\n**Ji** (己) contains Wood—*Xiaoji* (小吉).\n**Tianxiang** (天罡) also contains Wood.\n**Xin** (辛) contains Fire—*Xiaoji* (小吉).\n**Hekui** (河魁) also contains Fire.\n**Gui** (癸) contains Earth—*Xiaoji* (小吉).\n**Hekui** (河魁) also contains Earth.\n\nThese are the *wuqi* that should be used.\n\nOnly on **Wu-You** (戊酉) days is this applied—\nOn *gang* (刚) days, if *wuqi* arises from *yang*, it is new;\nIf from *yin*, it is old.\nIf *Wangxiangqi* (王相气) is present, it is new;\nIf *Qiu-Siqi* (囚死气) is present, it is old.\nIf *wuqi* arises from *yang*, it is future matters;\nIf from *yin*, it is past matters.\n\nAnother method:\nToday, **Yi** (乙) *Tianyiyiliuren* (天一六壬) is new—*Daji* (大吉) is old.\nToday, **Ding** (丁) *Chuansong* (传送) is new—*Tiancheng* (天呈) is old.\nToday, **Ji** (己) *Dengming* (登明) is new—*Xiaoji* (小吉) is old.\nToday, **Xin** (辛) *Gongcao* (功曹) is new—*Hekui* (河魁) is old.\nToday, **Gui** (癸) *Taiyi* (太一) is new—*Tianxiang* (天罡) is old.\nEach is spoken of by the *Shenjiang* (神将).\n\nToday, **Yi** (乙) Wood is born in **Hai** (亥), thrives in **Mao** (卯), dies in **Wei** (未).\n**Dengming** (登明) is used for old matters,\n**Taichong** (太冲) for new matters,\n**Xiaoji** (小吉) for future matters.\nOthers follow this.\n\n---\n**Third Principle:**\n\n*\"The four *li* (立) days are called the four *jue* (绝).\nThis means: ‘Who is in sorrow?’—heaven’s calamity gazes upon you.\nThe four *li* are:\n- **Lichun** (立春) – *Shaoyang* (少阳) *qi* begins,\n- **Lixia** (立夏) – *Taiyang* (太阳) *qi* begins,\n- **Liqiu** (立秋) – *Shaoyin* (少阴) *qi* begins,\n- **Lidong** (立冬) – *Taiyin* (太阴) *qi* begins.\nThus, they are called the four *li*.\n\nWhat are the four *jue*?\nThe day when death begins to establish itself—\nThe day before, sorrow and grief are passed on,\nAnd the separation is absolute—hence, *sijue* (四绝).\n\nFor example, if **Lichun** (立春) is preceded by **Ji** (己) day,\nThe heavenly day governs **Ji** (己).\nAt this time, divining auspiciousness and inauspiciousness\nWill certainly bring violent calamity at the door—bloodshed reaching the county magistrate.\nAt this time, women give birth inauspiciously.\n\nThe *yue shen* (月神) governs this day—\n*Yue shen* refers to:\n- **First Month** – *Dengming* (登明),\n- **Second Month** – *Hekui* (河魁) *yuejiang* (月将).\nBoth are death hours—nature is swift.\n\nFor example, if **Xinhai** (辛亥) is **Lichun** (立春),\nThe day before is **Gengxu** (庚戌)—*yuejiang* governs **Geng** (庚).\n\n‘Who is in sorrow?’—heaven’s calamity gazes upon you.\nIf this day governs you,\nDivining all matters will certainly bring violent death on the road—\nThose who do not perish within the month.\n\nOnly if **Geng** (庚) is governed without its arrival—\nAll are spoken of by the *Shenjiang* (神将).\n\n---\n**Fourth Principle:**\n\n*\"The four *li* (离) hours—\nIf the upper day governs the month, this is inauspicious.\nAuspiciousness has no degree—heaven’s bandits pass through.\n\nThe four *li* days are:\n- **Lichun** (立春), **Chunfen** (春分),\n- **Lixia** (立夏), **Xiazhi** (夏至),\n- **Liqiu** (立秋), **Qiufen** (秋分),\n- **Lidong** (立冬), **Dongzhi** (冬至).\"*\n\n「These four *li* (departure) hours—\nWhen the upper day gazes upon the lunar mansion, it is said:\nJanuary **Shi** (室), February **Kui** (奎), March **Wei** (胃), April **Bi** (毕),\nMay **Jing** (井), June **Liu** (柳), July **Zhang** (张), August **Jiao** (角),\nSeptember **Zhi** (氏), October **Xin** (心), November **Dou** (斗), December **Xu Nü** (须女).\n\nThis means that on the day of **Chunfen** (Spring Equinox),\nthe *yin* and *yang* forces depart,\neach following its own command.\n\nAuspiciousness has no degree—heaven’s bandits pass through.\nOn the day of **Chunfen**, the *yin* force is in **Mao** (卯),\nwhere it plunders and slays all plants,\nand the **yú jiá** (榆荚, *elm samaras*) fall.\n\nOn the day of **Xiazhi** (Summer Solstice), the *yang* force is in **Wu** (午),\nwhere it plunders and slays all plants,\nand the **jì mài** (荠麦, *wild buckwheat*) wither.\n\nOn the day of **Qiufen** (Autumn Equinox), the *yin* force is in **You** (酉),\nwhere autumn presides over punishment and execution,\nyet there remains the fragrance of autumnal splendor.\n\nOn the day of **Dongzhi** (Winter Solstice), the *yang* force is in **Zi** (子),\nwhere all things lie dormant in hibernation,\nand the **jì mài** (荠麦) and similar plants\nbegin to grow only with winter’s onset—\nnone of these are true vitality.\n\nHence it is said:\nThe bandits who plunder the moon are the essence of accumulated *yin*.\nThey preside over punishment.\nIf this is used for divination, bandits and thieves will violently arrive,\nand those who do not perish within the day.\n\nThe **Shenjiang** (神将, *Divine General*) of the lunar mansion will speak of this.\n\nAnother method:\nOn **Chunfen**, the **Jiazi** (甲子) *li* hour is **Hài** (亥).\nIf the lunar mansion gazes upon **Hài**,\nthis is inauspicious for long journeys—\none will certainly encounter thieves and bandits,\nlose property, or die on the road.\n\nWhy is this so?\nOn **Chunfen**, the *yin* force is in **Mao** (卯),\nwhere the bandits plunder and slay plants.\n\nThe **Fifth Principle** states:\nWhen the hour overcomes its day,\nand the use reinforces it,\nthe matter being treated is of the upper day—\nthe upper day becomes a source of sorrow,\nand the generals wage an internal conflict.\n\nThis is called the **Tian Gāng** (天罡, *Celestial Check*) of the four **Zhang** (张, *spread/extend*).\nAll things are harmed.\n\nFor example, if today the **Jia-Yi** (甲乙) hour combines with **Gēng** (庚),\n**Xin** (辛) is metal, and metal overcomes **Jia-Yi** (甲乙, *wood*).\nHence it is said that the hour overcomes its day and use—\nthe generals transmit and send from **Kui** (魁), along with metal,\nand again overcome **Jia-Yi** (甲乙, *wood*).\n\nThis is called the **use reinforcing the hour’s generals**;\nThe generals wage an internal conflict means—\nthat the generals transmit and send from **Kui**,\nand together form the **Qīnglóng** (青龙, *Green Dragon*), which is wood.\nThey fear the generals transmitting and sending from **Kui**, which is metal.\nThis is called internal conflict.\n\nThe rest follows this pattern accordingly.»\n\nThe **Celestial Check**—when the hour, the use, and the affairs under governance all conspire to overcome today’s stem-branch, while also clashing above and below, seeking aid yet finding no resolution—\nthus it is said that the four **Zhang** bring ruin to all undertakings.\nFor when actions are taken at such a time, they fail, bringing sorrow, injury, and loss of family.\nFor instance, if in the second month the **Gēng-Zǐ** (庚子) hour is combined with **Jǐ** (己), and **Dàyī** (太一) is added to **Zǐ** (子), the lower overcomes the upper as the use—\nwhen the hour is added to **Sì** (巳), **Sì** overcomes **Gēng**, making it the hour overcoming the day.\n**Dàyī** serves as the use, again overcoming **Gēng**, making it the use reinforcing the hour’s power.\nThus, when divining auspiciousness or misfortune, follow the method above.\n\nThe **Sixth Canon** states:\n*\"The Yang does not unite with the Yin, nor does the Yin align with the Yang,\nand the three transmissions harmonize as in the previous comparisons.\"*\n\nThe **Law** says:\n*\"Without harmony, without harmony, deceit arises within.*\nFor example, in the first month, if the **Jia-Zǐ** (甲子) hour is combined with **Mǎo** (卯)—\n**Jia** (陽, *Yang*) as the husband,\n**Zǐ** (陰, *Yin*) as the wife—\nwhen **Jia** is encountered, the transmission adds **Zǐ**, and **Jia** seeks to follow **Zǐ**, yet fears the transmission.\nIt seeks to follow **Jia**, but fears the **Hékuí** (河魁, *River Chief*), the earth—thus they do not align naturally.\nThe three transmissions harmonize when the three gods return,\nself-comparing as kindred types—\nreferring to the **three woods, three metals, three fires**.\nThis means the use arises from **Kuí** (魁), the transmission prevails over the first, and the final is **Gōngcáo** (功曹).\nThat is, **Yín-Wǔ-Xū** (寅午戌) are all fire positions,\n**Hài-Mǎo-Wèi** (亥卯未) are all wood,\n**Shēn-Zǐ-Chén** (申子辰) are all water,\n**Sì-Yǒu-Chǒu** (巳酉丑) are all metal—this is what is meant.\nWhen divining for people, it signifies deceitful and perverse intentions,\nand that affairs will be in peril and fail.\n\nIn the eighth month, if the **Gēng-Chén** (庚辰) hour is combined with **Shēn** (申),\nand **Celestial Check** is added to **Gēng**, while **Shénhòu** (神后) is added to **Chén**—\nthe **Celestial Check**’s earth overcomes **Shénhòu**’s water,\nmaking it the Yang not uniting with the Yin,\nand the Yin not aligning with the Yang.\n**Shénhòu** is Yin, fearing the **Celestial Check**’s earth—\nthus the Yin does not align with the Yang.\nThe use arises from **Shénhòu**, the transmission encounters the transmission,\nand the final is **Celestial Check**—these are the three transmissions.\nAll are of their kind.\nThus it is said:\n*\"This comparison shows Yin and Yang not uniting,\nyet the three transmissions internally harmonize.*\nWhen divining for people, it speaks of internal private alliances,\nwhere kin conspire with litigious intent.\nHow is this known?\"*\n\n「神后既为天罡之阴，又为起用之阳，\n一神有二从，故知人有两心，媱泆之意。\n言无媱者，以此时御媱妇，必有祸起也。\n上克下，过在男；下克上，过在女；\n以**Shénhòu**将言之。\n\n第七经曰：\n**Yang**无所依，**Yin**无所亲，\n祸生於外内及其身。\n所谓**Yang**无所依，谓用下克上，**Yin**无所亲。\n言归**Yin**克，**Dà'è**；\n天地反时也。\n正月庚寅壬午时加己，\n此时不可举百事，\n咎及其身，进退失节，重有忧也。\n正月壬子时加己，\n**Tàiyī**加壬，**Shèngxiān**加子，\n是**Yang**无所依。\n**Shèngxiān**传见**Shénhòu**，**Tàiyī**传见**Dēngmíng**，\n为**Yin**无所亲。\n以此占人，\n君无所因，父无所亲，\n必见欺。\n绍当此之时，\n天地犹恐，\n况于民乎。\n\n第八经曰：\n辰克其日，下克上，\n是谓**Luànshǒu**，\n必将害老者也。\n辰克日者，\n诸日伐伐自临其辰也。\n假令今日丙子，\n**Tàiyī**挟丙加子，**Yǐyǔ**太冲挟乙加酉，\n壬戌**Dēngmíng**挟壬加戌，\n癸未**Shénhòu**挟癸加未，\n丁亥**Shèngxiān**挟丁加亥，\n甲申**Gōngcáo**挟甲加申，\n辛巳从**Kuí**挟辛加己，\n己卯小吉挟己加卯，\n戊寅**Tiāngēng**挟戊加寅，\n此皆辰克其日，用下克上。\n以此占人事，\n必为逆**Dao**，\n臣弒其君，子害其父母，\n妻谋其夫，奴婢害主，\n百事凶。\n正月甲申时加卯，\n来克甲，**Yīnì**也。\n**Kuí**加甲，\n为用下克上，**Èr

Suppose today is *Jiazi* (甲子): the first *Jia* (甲) is the **day-pillar**, and *Zi* (子) is the **hour-pillar**.\n**Yin** and **yang** refer to the **divine yang** (陽神) of the day-pillar and the

*Zi* (子), there is no mutual opposition;\nIf *Chuánsòng* (傳送) is the *Dengming* (登明) yin, there is no mutual opposition;\nIf *Shèngxiān* (勝先) is the *Kuaìgāng* (魁罡) yin, with the *yang* above and

opposition;\nIf **yin** obtains *Xiǎojí* (小吉), there is no mutual opposition;\nIf *Zéi* (賊) and *Shèngxiān* (勝先) govern *Shēn* (申), with the *yang* above opposing the *yin* below, this is taken as the *use*.\n\nIf the **Marshal** (將) obtains *Tiānhòu* (天后), and the **Fire Deity** (火神) is also in the *Jīnxiāng* (金乡), this brings **worry**—women will be uneasy, as if pregnant but miscarrying or

**disquiet reaching the county magistrate** (不安至縣官), it is a cause for concern.\n\nIf the **Marshal** (將) obtains three *transmissions* (傳) and three *fires* (火), this brings **worry of losing property to fire, killing others, sudden thunderstrikes, or disputes**.\n\nThe **auspicious period** (吉期) is determined by what the *use* generates, while the **inauspicious period** (凶期) is determined by what it fears.\n\nIf *Gōngcāo* (功曹) is the *use*, then joy lies in *Bǐng-Dīng* (丙丁), while misfortune lies in *Gēng-Xīn* (庚辛).\n\nIf the *use* arises from a **yang hour-pillar** (陽辰), then the **worry** will be **repurposed by others** (事廢他人);\nIf the *use* arises from a **yang hour-pillar** (陽辰) for a **future matter** (方來), but is in an **yin hour-pillar** (陰辰), then the

*use* obtains the **orphan** (孤) of the *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) as **Firstborn** (元子), or the **void** (虚) of the *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) as **First Husband** (元夫), then:\nIf the *use* is overcome by **Kingly Qi** (王氣),

(驚恐、失氣、狂).\n\nThe *Liùjiǎ* (六甲) are always considered **void and empty** (虚衝) for *Wù-Jǐ* (戊己).\n\nThe Second Canon states:\nWithin the **day-pillar** and **hour-pillar**, if there are two mutual oppositions between **yin** and **yang**, first take the **lower overcoming the upper** (下克上) as the *use*;\nIf the **upper overcomes the lower** (上克下), it is **顺** (顺);\nIf the **lower overcomes the

**auspicious** and **inauspicious**.\n\n**Metal entering Wood** (金入木) brings **injury to others** (傷人者也), and **worry of disputes reaching the county magistrate** (忧斗讼至县官).\n**Wood entering Metal** (木入金) brings **worry for women reaching the county magistrate** (忧女人至县官).\n**Water entering Earth** (水入土) brings **worry of lost or abandoned money and resources** (忧亡遺錢財).\n**Earth entering Water** (土入水) brings **worry of disputes over cloth** (忧斗争布帛).\n**Wood entering Earth** (木入土) brings **worry of imprisonment, disputes, or entanglements with money and resources** (忧牢狱、口舌、财物系伤).\n**Earth entering Wood** (土入木) brings **worry for men with serious illness, or the need for ancestral sacrifices** (忧男子持重疾病、欲祠杞).\n**Metal entering Fire** (金入火) brings **worry of outsiders deceiving and

      "translated_text": "「If *Kuaìgāng* (魁罡) is overcome by the lower, then slaves and servants follow suit, and the matter will involve grave worries, with hidden plots and betrayals.\n\nIf the *use* (用) arises from a lowly person, and is also overcome by conflicting *qi* (气), then disputes over wealth and property will ensue.\n\nIf the *transmission* (传) secures **Great Auspiciousness** (大吉), and ends at **Supreme Unity** (太一), then there will be talk of battles, injuries, and even death. Why so? Because the *use* (用) originates from the three *Jīn* (金), ending at **Supreme Unity** (太一), while the **Marshal** (将) secures **White Tiger** (白虎). This is to be discerned by intention.\n\nOther cases follow this pattern.\n\nThe **Third Canon** (第三经) states: In the *Yīn-Yáng* (阴阳) of day and hour, there may be two instances of the lower overcoming the upper, or two instances of the upper overcoming the lower. First, the one that aligns with the day is taken as the *use* (用), meaning one must secure the day’s *qi* (气) to fulfill its purpose. This is called the **double overcoming** (重相克), where the one aligning with the day is chosen, as it involves two *uses* (用). The *comparison* (比), being near, means the worry lies within; the *non-comparison* (不比), being distant, means there are enmities. Thus, one must secure the *comparison* (比) with the day, for it pertains to bandits, thieves, or lost persons within the household.\n\nSuppose in the first month, on a *Xīnhài* (辛亥) day, with the hour of *Mǎo* (卯) at dawn, **Victory Before** (胜先) added by *Xīn* (辛), **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) added by *Hài* (亥). Here, there are two instances of the upper overcoming the lower. **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) aligns with *Xīn* (辛), with no *Xīnwù* (辛丑) but *Xīnwèi* (辛未) present, so **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) should be the *use* (用).\n\nSuppose in the second month, on a *Bǐngwǔ* (丙午) hour, with *Wèi* (未) added, **Transmission** (传送) added by *Bǐng* (丙), and *Kuaìgāng* (魁罡) added by *Wǔ* (午). Here, there are two instances of the lower overcoming the upper. **Transmission** (传送) aligns with *Bǐng* (丙), with no *Bǐngyǒu* (丙酉) but *Bǐngshēn* (丙申) present, so **Transmission** (传送) should be the *use* (用).\n\nFor **Yang days** (刚日), if the *use* (用) secures **Wood** (木), there will be worries about official documents and litigation. If it secures **Fire** (火), there will be worries about fields, houses, and disputes. If it secures **Wood** (木), there will be worries about officials and malevolent spirits. If it secures **Metal** (金), there will be worries about relocation, instability, and weapons. If it secures **Water** (水), there will be worries about women bearing heavy burdens, or even death. If **Water** (水) is secured in the *use* (用) on a **Yang day** (卯日), there will be worries about wooden objects, ships, and carriages, or theft. If **Water** (水) is secured, there will be worries about battles, breaches, and bloodshed. If **Earth** (土) is secured, there will be worries about wealth and grains. If **Metal** (金) is secured, there will be worries about livestock. If **Fire** (火) is secured, there will be worries about women being conscripted, or internal discord through jealousy.\n\nSuppose in the first month, on a *Rénchén* (壬辰) hour, with *Chén* (辰) added, **Victory Before** (胜先) governs *Rén* (壬), with the lower overcoming the upper; **Ascending Brightness** (登明) added by *Chén* (辰), again with the lower overcoming the upper. This is said because there is no *Rénhài* (壬亥) but *Rénwǔ* (壬午) exists, so **Victory Before** (胜先) should be the *use* (用). If the *qi* (气) of **Old Age** (老气) is overcome, then there will be worries about illness.\n\nIf **Fire enters Water** (火入水), and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Heavenly Mother** (天后), then the matter will involve women.\n\nIf the *transmission* (传) meets **Great Auspiciousness** (大吉) and aligns with **Hooked Array** (勾陈), then there will be worries about battles.\n\nIf the *end* (终) aligns with **Transmission** (传送) governing entry and exit, and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Three Dark Turtles** (三玄武), then there will be talk of distant travels with losses.\n\nIf **Transmission** (传送) is added by *Chǒu* (丑), meaning the lower governs its grave, then there will be worries of sorrow, displeasure, joyful dreams of the dead, or encounters with widows and the lonely.\n\nIf **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) secures **Divine Marshal** (神后) and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Heavenly Void** (天空), then a woman will plot to deceive her husband, harboring two hearts.\n\nIf the *end* (终) aligns with **Supreme Unity** (太一) and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Heavenly Mother** (天后), then there will be grave worries about women.\n\nIf the *use* (用) is overcome by **Royal Qi** (王气), then there will be worries about officials, with the threat of military action, enmities, and mutual harm. This is because Fire adds to Water.\n\nOther cases follow this pattern.\n\nThe **Fourth Canon** (第四经) states: In the *Yīn-Yáng* (阴阳) of day and hour, if there are two *comparisons* (比), then the one that first enters and causes deeper harm is taken as the *use* (用). This is what is called **observing the subtle and discerning the mechanism** (察其微，见其机). The phrase **rising at Seasonal Pivot and Midpoint** (起季仲) refers to the subtle, while **in the First Month** (在孟) refers to the mechanism. The **mechanism** (机) means worries of probing; the **subtle** (微) means worries of shallowness, indicating ease of passage.\n\nSuppose in the eighth month, on a **Yīzhēn** (甲申) day at dawn, **Heavenly Marshal** (天罡) added by *Jiǎ* (甲), with the lower overcoming the upper; **Divine Marshal** (神后) governs *Shēn* (申) as the **River Marshal** (河魁), with the lower overcoming the upper. This means **Heavenly Marshal** (天罡) and **Divine Marshal** (神后) are both overcome by the lower. Again, they both align with *Jiǎ* (甲), as there is also *Jiǎzǐ* (甲子). **Heavenly Marshal** (天罡) is **Earth added by *Jiǎ*** (土加甲), first entering the **Wood domain** (木乡), causing harm akin to probing, thus being the **mechanism** (机). **Divine Marshal** (神后) governs *Xū* (戌) and turns to enter the **Water domain** (水乡), being the **subtle** (微), so **Heavenly Marshal** (天罡) should be the *use* (用).\n\nSuppose in the seventh month, on a **Yīzǐ** (甲子) day, with the hour of *Hài* (亥) added, **Transmission** (传送) added by *Jiǎ* (甲), with the upper overcoming the lower; **Old Age** (老气) secures **Functionary** (功曹), with the lower overcoming the upper; **Victory Before** (胜先) governs *Zǐ* (子), with the lower overcoming the upper; and **Old Age** (老气) secures **Divine Marshal** (神后), with the upper overcoming the lower. All these align with the day, and **Victory Before** (胜先) progresses through *Gǒu* (癸) to *Chǒu* (丑), while **Functionary** (功曹) is at *Gēngyǒu* (庚酉) and *Xīn* (辛) causes deeper harm, so **Functionary** (功曹) should be the *use* (用). This is called **advancing and retreating without proper measure**, with grave worries.\n\nIn the first month, on a *Xīnyǒu* (辛酉) hour, with *Wǔ* (午) added, **Great Pivot** (太冲) governs *Xīn* (辛), with the lower overcoming the upper; **Transmission** (传送) is the **Old Age** (老气) of **Great Pivot** (太冲) and governs *Mǎo* (卯), with the upper overcoming the lower; **Functionary** (功曹) added by *Yǒu* (酉), with the lower overcoming the upper; and **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) is the **Functionary** (功曹), with **Old Age** (老气) added by *Yín* (寅), again with the lower overcoming the upper. Both **Great Pivot** (太冲) and **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) are overcome by the lower, and they both align with *Xīn* (辛). **Great Pivot** (太冲) progresses through *Xīn* (辛) to *Xū* (戌), causing shallow harm; **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) first enters the **Wood domain** (木乡), causing slight harm. Thus, **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) should be the *use* (用). This is called **glimpsing one’s enemy and gazing upon their mound**. **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) governs women, and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Victorious Snake** (胜蛇), bringing worries of death, women, fear, and strange blood on birth days. If **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) passes **Bundle North** (束北), then the **Ghost Gate** (鬼门) will see ghosts.\n\nIf **Transmission** (传) secures **Divine Marshal** (神后) and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Heavenly Emptiness** (天空), then a woman will seek to deceive her husband, harboring two hearts.\n\nIf the *end* (终) aligns with **Supreme Unity** (太一) and the **Marshal** (将) secures **Heavenly Mother** (天后), then there will be grave worries about women.\n\nIf the *use* (用) is overcome by **Royal Qi** (王气), then there will be worries about officials, with the threat of military action, enmities, and mutual harm. This is because Fire adds to Water.\n\nOther cases follow this pattern.\n\nThe **Fifth Canon** (第五经) states: In the *Yīn-Yáng* (阴阳) of day and hour, if there is no mutual opposition, then the one that is distantly opposed to the day’s *qi* (气) is taken as the *use* (用). This is called **interacting without mutual opposition, entering from an independent source** (交俱不相克，入从独立者). Here, there is one **Divine Marshal** (神后) residing in the yin, opposing the day. If the day progresses to overcome the **Divine Marshal** (神后) in the yin, then the **Divine Marshal** (神后) will come to oppose the day, causing worries from outside. If the day progresses to overcome the **Divine Marshal** (神后), then there will be enmities arising internally, with hopes of distant people who do not come. Though the hour may have distant opposition, it does not qualify as the *use* (用). The *use* (用) is determined by the day, not the hour. Suppose in the fourth month, on a *Xīnyǒu* (辛酉) hour, with *Jǐ* (己) added, and **Great Auspiciousness** (大吉) added by *Xīn* (辛), with no mutual opposition; **Old Age** (老气) secures **Heavenly Marshal** (天罡), with no opposition; **Divine Marshal** (神后) added by *Yǒu* (酉), with no opposition; and **Old Age** (老气) secures **Great Pivot** (太冲), all without mutual opposition. *Xīn* (辛) distantly opposes **Great Pivot** (太冲), so it should be the *use* (用).\n\nSuppose in the fifth month, on a *Jiǎwǔ* (甲午) hour, with *Xū* (戌) added, and **Ascending Brightness** (登明) added by *Jiǎ* (甲), with no mutual opposition;」",

      "translated_text": "The **Wu-Ji-Xin-Ren** days (戊己辛壬), when paired with **Zi-Wu-Mao-You** hours (子午卯酉), are the **Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth**, returning calamity to the **Nine Homeless** (九丑). The **Nine Homeless** refers to the five stems and four branches combining into nine.\n\n**Great Auspiciousness** (大吉) constantly occupies the **Great Kill** (大杀) above, and its killing is thus called **Homeless** (丑). When the four **Companion** days (四仲) are added to the four **Companion** hours, and **Great Auspiciousness** transits over the day-hour, undertaking all affairs is **greatly inauspicious**.\n\nWhen **Great Auspiciousness** is added to the day, it harms the elder; when added to the hour, it harms the younger. On **Yang** days, it harms men; on **You** days (酉), it harms women. When the day is in **Yang**, it injures husbands; when in **Yin**, it injures wives. Double **Yin** harms fathers; double **Yin** harms mothers.\n\n**Heaven One** (天一) before is **Yang**; **Heaven One** after is **Yin**. All days and hours before **Heaven One** are **double Yang**; all days and hours after **Heaven One** are **double Yin**.\n\nUsing the **Four Seasons’ qi** as the **King’s Minister** for three years, and as **Imprisonment and Death** for three months. Using **Great Auspiciousness** in conjunction to describe its form: when the four branches align with the **Great Auspiciousness**, it is **greatly auspicious**; when aligned with inauspiciousness, like adding **Nine Homeless**, it is **greatly inauspicious**, with heavy calamity—certain misfortune, executions, death, bloodshed across thousands of *li*, and none escaping.\n\nThe **Canon** states: *Yǐ* (乙) is the beginning of thunder and lightning; *Wu-Ji* (戊己) are the days when **Beidou** (北辰) descends. *Xin* (辛) marks the beginning of autumn executions, a day when the **Three Lights** (王日月三光) do not shine, a day of no merit. The **Four Companion** hours are the days of life and death for all things. **Great Auspiciousness** is where the **day, moon, and five stars** begin. Thus, their conjunction brings harm.\n\nFor example, in the second month, if *Ren-Zi* (壬子) hour is added to *You* (酉), and **Great Auspiciousness** transits over *Zi* (子), a **Yang** day, the eldest son will be killed, with the term falling on *Wu-Chen* (戊辰), *Wu-Xu* (戊戌), *Ji-Wei* (己未), and *Ji-Chou* (己丑). This is because **Water** (王水) harms **Earth** (土), so **Earth** days and **Earth** months are the terms. In the four seasons, when **Earth** month and hour are added to *You* (酉), it is the **Four Companion** hour. **Great Auspiciousness** added to *Zi* (子) is adding to a **Yang** hour, and the younger son bears it. In the second month, the **Great Hour** is in *Zi* (子) of spring, and **Earth** is dead. This is **great inauspiciousness**; next, determine who bears it.\n\nUsing **Great Auspiciousness** in conjunction to describe its effects:\n- **Tai-Yin** (太阴) in conjunction brings **sacrificial rites and ghostly disturbances**, causing **Tengshe** (腾蛇) to fail or sudden death;\n- **Zhuque** (朱雀) in conjunction brings **clerical errors or burning deaths**;\n- **Liuhe** (六合) in conjunction brings **women’s infidelity, wet-nursing, and illegitimate births**;\n- **Gouchen** (勾陈) in conjunction brings **clustered deaths**;\n- **Qinglong** (青龙) in conjunction brings **surplus food, drink, money, and wealth**;\n- **Tianyi** (天一) in conjunction brings **shared worries with nobles**;\n- **Tianhou** (天后) in conjunction brings **women bearing another man’s child**;\n- **Xuanwu** (玄武) in conjunction brings **theft, livestock failures, and disasters**;\n- **Taichang** (太常) in conjunction brings **women losing fields, residences, and property**;\n- **Baihu** (白虎) in conjunction brings **death and funeral disasters**;\n- **Tiankong** (天空) in conjunction brings **theft, deception, and fraud**.\n\nIn the eleventh month, if *Yi-Mao* (乙卯) hour is added to *Chen* (辰), **Great Auspiciousness** added to *Yi* (乙) is in use. Obtaining **She** (蛇), with **transmission** reaching three **Earths**, worries over women and disputes over fields and residences fall upon the eldest daughter.\n\nIn the eighth month, if *Wu-Zi* (戊子) hour is added to *Mao* (卯), **Great Auspiciousness** added to *Zi* (子), with **Yin-Functionary** (阴功曹) in use, though **Great Auspiciousness** is not in use, it is still **Nine Homeless**, harming the younger son. **Great Auspiciousness** disturbs tombs and ancestral graves. Follow this principle.\n\nThe **Ninth Canon** states:\n*\"All systems say divination for affairs: when the hour travels forward to add to the day above, and the lower overpowers the upper as in use, it is said to hold its own while advancing upon others—like a son-in-law with malicious intent. For example, if today is *Jia-Xu* (甲戌), and **He-Kui** (河魁) transits over *Jia* (甲), *Yi-Wei* (乙未) is **Lesser Auspiciousness**; transiting over *Yi* (乙), *Bing-Shen* (丙申) is **Transmission**; added to *Bing* (丙), *Jia-Chen* (甲辰) is **Heavenly Gang** (天罡); added to *Jia* (甲), *Yi-Chou* (乙丑) is **Great Auspiciousness**. Transiting over *Yi* (乙), this is the hour added to the day, and the lower overpowers the upper. Using this to divine auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, the younger harms the elder, the household clashes, internal and external infidelity, and the **Dao/Way of internal chaos**. Ministers plot against their lords, sons scheme against their fathers, and slaves conspire against their masters.\n\nAnother method:\n- **He-Kui** (河魁) added to *Jia* (甲) brings **executions, lawsuits over hills and valleys**.\n- **Lesser Auspiciousness** (小吉) added to *Yi* (乙) brings worries over women and food/drink.\n- **Tai-Yi** (太一) added to *Gui* (癸) brings lawsuits over clothing.\n- *Hai* (亥) added to *Ji* (己) brings women competing over money.\n- **From He-Kui** (从魁) added to *Ding* (丁) brings disputes over divisions.\n- **Victory First** (胜先) added to *Ren* (壬) brings lawsuits over fields and residences, women, and sudden fires.\n- **Shenhou** (神后) added to *Xu* (戌) brings women dying from illness or washing.\n- Obtaining **Tianhou** (天后) brings infidelity among relatives.\n\nIt is also said: In the second month, if *Jia-Xu* (甲戌) hour is added to *Yin* (寅), **He-Kui** and the **Moon Deity** (月神) are in conjunction, *Wei* (未) is not added to *Jia* (甲), the lower overpowers the upper—auspicious. Yet there is still infidelity and chaos. Obtaining **Zhuque** (朱雀) brings internal accusations;",
