  "full_translation": "*The Rites of the Illuminating Lamps for the Five Manifest Spirits of the Luminous Temple*\n**Text Title:** *The Rites of the Illuminating Lamps for the Five Manifest Spirits of the Luminous Temple*. One fascicle.\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Weiyi* Category.\n\n---\n\n*The Rites of the Illuminating Lamps for the Five Manifest Spirits of the Luminous Temple*\n\nThe ritual proceeds according to form. The invocation begins:\n\nIncense is burned in offering to:\nThe Mighty Marshal of All-Heaven’s Majestic Might, King of Manifest Wisdom, Responsive Brilliance, Benevolence, and Vast Salvation;\nThe Marshal of the Vast Heavenly Hosts, King of Manifest Clarity, Illustrious Valor, Righteousness, and Broad Protection;\nThe Golden-Eyed Marshal Who Penetrates Heaven, King of Manifest Rectitude, Summoning Compliance, Wisdom, and Vast Favor;\nThe Marshal of Soaring Heavenly Wind and Fire, King of Manifest Integrity, Illuminating Aid, Trustworthiness, and Abundant Blessing;\nThe Marshal of Cinnabar Heaven Who Subdues Demons, King of Manifest Virtue, Illustrious Benefit, Compassion, and Vast Accomplishment;\nMinister Shi the Assisting Spirit, Minister Bian the Aiding Compliance;\nGeneral Zhou the Responsive Guardian;\nDirectors Wang and Nian;\nThe Two Marshals Huang and Wang;\nSecretary Linghu;\nThe Auspicious Youth;\nThe Earthly Deities and True Officials;\nThe Merit-Recording Officers of the Day;\nThe Divine Kin of the Rear Palace’s Immortal Springs;\nThe Attendant Might of the Numinous Compliance Dharma Host—\nall of whom are invited to receive this true incense, universally offered in devotion.\n\nNow, it is held that:\nWisdom and clarity constitute sageliness, ever manifesting traces among mortals;\nUprightness defines divinity, repeatedly revealing its name through the ages.\n\nWe open the divine halls of the Five Penetrations, and next, the dim crossroads of the Six Obscurities. Between heaven and earth, wind and fire, water—all flow unimpeded; the sages of benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, trust, and love bestow their grace far and wide. May all sentient beings turn their light inward, thus awakening to the workings of fate and perceiving the dawn. In reverence of the radiant brilliance before us, we grandly perform the Lamp Rite; with earnest and unwavering sincerity, we humbly seek your mirrored reflection. In all movement and stillness, we rely upon your protection. From afar, we gaze upon your resplendent countenance, offering our devotion and yearning for refuge. We look up to your divine chariot and bow down to behold the purity of our hearts.\n\nNow, I, though unworthy, stand within the human realm, adhering to the teachings and rituals. Having been bathed in your encompassing virtue, how dare I forget the reverence due in devotion? With respect, I choose this auspicious hour to solemnly present pure offerings. We humbly pray that silver lamps may illuminate our gates with splendor from this moment onward, and that precious incense may suffuse our beloved ones in harmonious well-being.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we submit ourselves to the All-Heaven Mighty Marshal, the Illustrious and Wise King of Manifest Clarity, Responsive Virtue, and Vast Salvation. For your wisdom is never deceitful, and your rewards and punishments never err by even a hair’s breadth; your benevolence toward the people leaves no merit or fault, however slight, unaddressed. Above, you reach the celestial palaces; below, you descend to the icy springs. You bestow blessings upon the mortal realm with clarity, and protect the common folk with solemn grace. The Nine Provinces revere you; the Four Seas turn to you in devotion. Those who do good enjoy boundless fortune; those who accumulate evil bring disaster upon themselves. Your responses are as certain as an echo in a valley, as evident as form and sound. Now, I, who have long revered your compassionate presence and constantly followed your teachings, offer these modest gifts as an expression of my sincerity. We humbly pray that your divine chariot may descend, secretly bestowing pure blessings; that your numinous might may cast its gaze, further extending your nurturing benevolence. May our ancestral line flourish, our gates remain pure and serene. With bowed heads, we take refuge and devoutly praise:\n\n*Majestic Emperor of Numinous Insight, revered divine power,\nSages of the Five Penetrations, royal saviors of the people,\nDeliverers from disaster, warders of calamity, greatly manifesting your might,\nWe pray you deign to look upon us and ever grant peace and prosperity.*\n\nWith devoted hearts, we submit ourselves to the Marshal of the Transverse-Heaven Hosts, the Illustrious and Resplendent King of Manifest Justice, Trust, and Vast Protection. For you are luminous yet never deluded; we look up to your majestic countenance. Your sublimity is vast; we contemplate your towering virtue. Ever extending your grace to all things, you constantly transform people through goodness. Your compassion universally ferries all beings; your might broadly prevails across the Three Realms. You reveal the beauty of blessings descending upon the good, and the causes of misfortune brewing from transgressions. In every prayer and plea, you unfailingly respond. Now, I, born foolish and dwelling in the mortal dust, humbly prepare incense and lamps to honor your sacred image. We humbly pray that you dispel the shadows of ignorance, scattering the light to dissolve misfortune; that you broadly bestow your merciful grace, filling the air with harmonious vapors. May high and low alike rejoice, every head and heel bathed in your favor. With bowed heads, we take refuge and devoutly praise:\n\n*Illustrious Great Sage, Resplendent and Mighty King,\nRewarding good and punishing evil, trusting and protecting our sovereign,\nYour numinous power pierces the Dipper, your qi blankets the Eight Directions,\nWe pray you bestow your radiant favor, ever unfolding fortune and blessing.*\n\nWith devoted hearts, we submit ourselves to the Marshal of the Heaven-Penetrating Golden Eyes, the Illustrious and Upright King of Manifest Rectitude, Wisdom, and Vast Benevolence. For you are upright and never deviant, ever bestowing grace to nurture all things; your prayers are always answered, your beneficence ever showered upon the people. Secret strategies and profound plans reside in your heart; you govern with compassion and magnanimity. Your commands follow the law, and fairness is your guide. You are sagely and divine, your rewards and punishments leaving nothing unaddressed, even to the smallest measure; whether civil or martial, the rise and fall of all depend upon your guidance. From ancient times to the present, fortune and misfortune are made manifest. Now, I, with solemn intent, have prepared your sacred image, desiring to honor your divine presence. With earnest sincerity, I humbly initiate this rite. We humbly pray that whether engaged in trade or commerce, all may become households of wealth; whether serving as officials or teachers, all may swiftly attain noble aspirations. May our gates be pure and auspicious, our families safe and prosperous. With bowed heads, we take refuge and devoutly praise:\n\n*Illustrious and Upright Great Sage, Numinous and Responsive Divine Power,\nYour wisdom and eloquence bring vast benevolence to the people,\nShowering treasures to relieve the needy, extending virtue and promoting kindness,\nEncompassing all beings, inspiring the myriad relationships.*\n\nWith devoted hearts, we submit ourselves to the Marshal of Flying Heaven, Wind, and Fire, the Illustrious and Upright King of Manifest Integrity, Trust, and Vast Blessing. For you are upright and never yield, a loyal spirit of former ages; trustworthy and never false, a numinous sage of this time. You adorn and nourish the land and its people, your might spreading across the Three Heavens, your merit towering over the Six Directions. To revere you is as natural as presence itself—misfortune vanishes, and fortune arises; to pray to you is to be certain of response—calamity dissolves, and good fortune arrives. All who shelter under your protection receive the grace of your salvation. A single sincere thought extends a hundred blessings. Now, I have cleansed my heart and purified my thoughts, cultivating virtue and examining myself. Behold these resplendent silver lamps and the fragrant smoke of precious incense. We look up to your divine chariot, praying that it may illuminate our humble hearts. We humbly pray that in public and private affairs, we may always enjoy auspicious fortune; in our duties and offices, we may daily avoid blame. May our lifespan increase, our bodies remain healthy and at peace. With bowed heads, we take refuge and devoutly praise:\n\n*Illustrious and Upright King of Vast Blessing,\nBestower of grace and virtue, bringing good fortune to all things,\nWhat disaster does not vanish? What blessing does not flourish?\nWe pray you turn your radiant favor toward us, granting harmony through the four seasons.*\n\nWith devoted hearts, we submit ourselves to the Marshal of Cinnabar Heaven Who Subdues Demons, the Illustrious King of Manifest Virtue, Benefit, Compassion, and Vast Accomplishment. For your virtue is universally extended to all phenomena, benefiting all things and cherishing the people; your grace reaches all beings, dispelling disaster and averting calamity. In ease and laughter, the divine winds fall silent; in leisurely wandering, the seas and lands become clear. In golden halls and jade chambers, your weary form is revealed; upon your sacred perch, your carved chariot and precious steed exude majesty. Your compassionate visage and divine bearing hold a golden brick; your feet tread upon a fiery chariot. Ever bestowing blessings to honor virtue, or manifesting calamity to display your might, you reveal your divine power and rightly receive our devotion.\n\nNow I, unworthy though I dwell in the lower lands, born within the Central Kingdom, owe my enduring seasons to your nurturing transformation, my days and nights to your vast shelter. Humbly I offer these meager words, looking up to repay your boundless grace.\n\nMay your crane-borne chariot glide lightly, your star-adorned carriage wing forth in splendor. From elders to infants, may all abide in tranquil realms; within kin and without, may all forever tread the path of peace and well-being. With bowed head I take refuge and reverently extol:\n\nIllustrious King of Manifest Virtue, Benefit, Compassion, and Vast Accomplishment,\nWho pacifies the people and aids all things, whose pure virtue extends benevolence.\nShould any supplication be made, may offerings bring tranquility.\nWith utmost devotion I invoke the Five Blessings to arrive as one.\n\nRecitation of scriptures—hitherto—dedication.\nThe Lamp Rite for the Great Emperor of the Five Manifest Spirits is now complete.",
