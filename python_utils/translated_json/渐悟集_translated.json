Era*, *Taiping* Section\n\n---\n\n**Gradual Enlightenment Collection, Volume I**\n*Composed by Mǎ Dānyáng of Mount Kūnyú*\n\n**Congratulating the Sage’s Advent (Two Poems)**\n*Presented to Minister Wang*\n\n**I.**\nAuspicious mist and blessed *qi* ever spread,\nthe heart then returns to its primal plain.\nThe world pursues—yet I abide in non-doing,\nthoughtless, careless, free of strain.\nCrimson chamber gathers the Maiden and Infant,\ntheir wisdom-eyes watch crow and hare.\nThe *Kǎn* and *Lí* palaces intertwine—\nwho among these grasps such affair?\n\n**II.**\nRobe of paper, hempen cloth, plain attire,\nfirmly rooted in the original simplicity.\nBefore the wind, beneath the moon, I strum the heart’s lute,\nuntainted by the slightest dust of worry.\nCloud-companions, radiance-friends ever gather,\nwatching the flying crow, the running hare.\nWithin the jade, the purple-golden elixir ripens—\nwho among these grasps such affair?\n\n---\n\n**Picking Mulberries (No. 1)**\n*Leaving Home to Enter the Dao*\n\nFúfēng’s Quán Dào bore the name Tōngyī,\nhis Daoist title: Carefree.\nBeholding a painted skull,\nhe fiercely gathered his mind—all affairs ceased.\nAt forty-six, frost silvered his temples,\nhe brushed his sleeves and wandered the clouds.\nNo need for stubborn clinging—\nit’s like the deadline of impermanence arriving at last.\n\n**II.**\nCorpse-walking bones, chasing fame and gain,\nfate’s decree is fixed and firm.\nThey heed not the body’s frame,\nskin and skeleton their funeral home.\nI urge men to sever the cords of clinging,\nleap from the red furnace’s flame.\nRestore the primordial state—\nthere’s a mountain rustic who lends his strength.\n\n**III.**\nThe mountain rustic cast off the worldly, sought the mysterious,\ntying true and good causes.\nDeep gratitude to the Perfected Master—\nthus he became a carefree, unbound man.\n\nI now vow never to return east,\nto die in Western Qin.\nThough my bones turn to dust,\nthey’ll not be buried by sons and grandsons by the sea.\n\n**[Dream-Awakening]**\nMaster Chongyang admonished and guided me in a hundred ways,\nyet I remained entangled in attachments.\nOne night, I dreamed I stood in the central courtyard, sighing:\n\"My life is like a delicate porcelain bowl—\none slip and it shatters into a hundred pieces.\"\nBefore the words were finished, the bowl fell from the sky,\nand I awoke with a startled cry.\nThe next day, the Master said:\n\"Your terror last night was the first glimmer of awakening.\"\n\nLü Dongbin awoke from the Yellow Millet Dream,\nabandoned his gilded carriage,\nreturned to the root, restored the source—\nall through Master Zhongli’s alchemy.\n\nThe mountain rustic, struck by the porcelain dream,\nsevered the cords of clinging,\nrefined mercury, simmered lead—\nthrough the Immortal of the Wind’s nature, the moon became full.\n\n**IV.**\nThe name appears before the truth is revealed,\na lamentable affair.\nIt uproots the foundation of the Dao—\nwho can one blame for losing the primordial state?\nBetter to be dull and awakened than clever and deluded,\nto play the fool,\nto act without contrivance,\nto cease weaving idle words or composing verses.\n\nVows I made—barefoot through summer, never drinking cool water;\nthrough winter, never facing fire’s glow.\nNow I swear within these encircling walls:\nin summer, I renounce all cooling springs;\nin winter, I scorn the reddened embers.\nI recognize the true crucible’s water-and-fire affinity.\nLonging to repay my Master’s grace, I cultivate with diligence,\nrefining mercury, simmering lead.\nWhen deeds are complete and merit full,\nI shall become a barefoot immortal of Penglai’s isles.\n\n*Tune: \"Exploring Spring\"*\nFor Wang Zhixuan\n\nWithin the grotto-heaven, several rounds of pure, pure rain—\npointing afar to the jade forest, worth beholding.\nA single jade staff, following as I walk,\ndiscovers within my nature the golden lotus blooming.\nYouthful maiden and radiant woman come to gather,\njoined by the true dragon and tiger.\nNaturally, it manifests—\nauspicious light covering all,\na single luminous sovereign.\n\n*Cherishing the Fragrant Season: Two Poems*\nFor Officer Li\n\nYou and I, born in the same *gui-mao* year,\nunaware that fifty-two years have flowed past.\nI entered the Dao first, delving into profound principles,\nnaturally unwilling to leave you behind.\nDay and night without distinction, I constantly attend to it,\nscribbling verses and songs on a thousand sheets of paper.\nI urge you to early abandon worldly ties,\nlest you stumble at the Yellow Springs’ edge.\n\nFor Wu Yu, the Desireless, Guardian of Compassion\n\nPure, pure, and serene—auspicious clouds at their feet.\nWithin the nine apertures, they interweave and traverse.\nWho knows the wondrous function arises from non-action?\nNaturally, the principle refines into the elixir.\nThe black dragon spits forth a divine pearl, resplendent,\nrevealing ten thousand rays of rosy light enveloping all.\nThe empty hall gleams, its radiance enhanced—\nsome promise awaits on Penglai’s path.\n\n*Three Poems to the Tune \"Willow Branches\"*\nFor Zhao Daoji\n\nWithin the day, the golden rooster crows once,\nstartling the dream awake.\nOn the pillow, a lingering coolness from the pure breeze,\nthe wine just sobered.\nMist rolls back, clouds gather—the sky like water,\nthe moon newly bright.\nThe empty hall, silent, utterly free of dust’s passions—\nthe nature just leveled.\n\n*For the Four Masters of the Countryside*\n\nA *Willow Branches* verse I sweep clean,\nto whom shall I send it?\nTo the one Yan, one Hao, and two Liu Immortals,\nI pour forth these words.\nBest to join Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma,\ntogether to delve into the profound.\nWhen the nine returns and seven reversals complete their work,\ngo to pay homage at the origin.\n\nFor Yunzhongzi, Su Xuan\n\nFiercely abandoning glory, wife, and children,\nawakening to the mystery’s mechanism.\nDrifting, drifting—utterly at ease in non-action,\nplaying the fool.\nNo wandering through cloud and water on fragrant grass paths—\nwithin, I uphold the practice.\nWhen merit is complete and deeds full,\nalone, where shall I go?\nI shall hasten to the Jasper Pool.\n\n*Six Poems to the Tune \"Fisherman’s Pride\"*\nAwakening to Myself\n\n**Dreaming of My Beloved Wife**\n\nI dreamed my tender wife called me \"mother,\"\nand met my cherished concubine—she called me \"daughter.\"\nAll because in past lives my heart knew no awakening.\n*Knew no awakening—*\nonly to change faces and become husband and wife.\n\nFrom this, ever trembling in the mountain wilds,\nhow could I bear further deliverance by Immortal Feng?\nI must purify myself and practice purity.\n*Practice purity—*\nwhere purple mushrooms mark the far shore, the path to the profound.\n\n**Again**\n\nSeventy years of light—how many days remain?\nAt most, twenty-five thousand days.\nEach day passed leaves one less.\n*One less—*\nsoon this body will be like the sun setting on Western Mountain.\n\nIf I do not cultivate the Dao, I waste my days in vain.\nOnce awakened, how could I idle till my end?\nI turn the wheel of the Grotto-Heaven’s true sun and moon.\n*True sun and moon—*\nin the Moon Palace, I lift the crimson sun.\n\n**To Sister Sun**\n\nI urge you, Sister Sun, to cultivate the Great Dao,\never sweeping clean the field of your heart.\nSlay the Three Corpses and the Six Wastrels.\n*Free from affliction—*\never pure, ever still, you will know the mystery’s depths.\n\nAsk not of strange names for furnace or hearth—\nharmony rises and falls, inverting all.\nLead and mercury naturally form the supreme treasure.\n*Most excellent—*\nclouds of rosy light will escort you to Penglai Isle.\n\n**To My Fellow Practitioners**\n\nI urge you, kindred spirits, to heed me closely:\nabstaining from meat and wine is wholly within reach.\nDisdaining fleeting wealth is but a trifling matter.\n*Yet deeply perilous—*\nthe slightest touch may rouse the flame of ignorance.\n\nBy and large, desire for form is hard to cast aside;\nyou must resolve to sever it yourself.\nTreat it as a foe, as a living ghost.\n*Best to keep far away—*\neven in dreams, you must shun it.\n\n**Again**\n\nI charge the kitchen master to do good always,\ndiligently offering sustenance without wearying.\nDo not pour boiling broth upon the ground.\n*Let it cool—*\nlest you harm the ants that pass by.\n\nIn daily use of firewood, rice, and flour,\nneither waste nor stint—let there be no excess.\nWithin and without, keep pure, forgetting worldly thoughts.\n*Truly admirable—*\nin time, you may dwell in the immortals’ courts.\n\n**Again**\n\nAn ox pulls a heavy cart on a treacherous road,\nyet the driver heeds not the hardship.\nHe strikes harder with the whip, but the ox will not move.\n*Will not move—*\nsuddenly, the ox speaks in human words:\n\n\"You toil to feed your family while I suffer.\nNow I must plead with you in pity.\nIf in this life your heart does not awaken,\n*Does not awaken—*\nthen in the next, *I* shall be *you*.\"\n\n**Two Poems to the Tune \"Green Willow Tips\"**\n\n*Matching an Ancient Verse*\n\nAwakened to the unborn and undying,\nI refuse to pluck flowers or gather leaves.\nJoyful, I sing aloud,\ndrunk, I sleep on fragrant grass,\ndreaming of wandering the immortals’ palaces.\n\nAt times, I exhort all people—\ndo not wonder at my earnest, repeated pleas.\nWalking corpses, bone-bags,\ngreedy for wealth, racing after desire,\nthey squander their years in vain.\n\n**Again**\n\n*Hidden Head*\n\n□ The wheel does not hasten birth or death.\n\n□ within the flame, lotus blooms with five petals.\n□ attains the golden flower, □ forms the magic herb,\n□ divides without lack.\n□ born Ma Yu, a foolish man,\n□ suddenly awakened—his family ties cut deep.\n□ split the mountain of grace, □ illumined for ages,\n□ discoursed on the moon of the heart.\n\n**Two Poems to the Tune \"Welcoming Spring Joy\"**\n\n*For Master Ru*\n\nWithin the body, timely signs ascend in purity and elegance—\nwhy need the pitch-pipes or clay oxen?\nThe herb-field relies on clouds to plow through,\nno longer requiring the plowman’s hand.\nCultivating life and spreading virtue, the work is complete,\ngolden sprouts bloom everywhere, surpassing flowers and willows.\nThe Jade Grotto bears the immortal embryo—\nnaturally, one drinks the wine of longevity.\n\n*For Master Liu*\n\nThe Dipper’s handle turns, first arriving at *Zhen*,\nnaturally, yang qi surges and swells.\nHow can the blue bird’s tidings be endured?\nThe earth-ox strikes—know the season’s division.\nThe sun travels the western path, golden light gleaming,\ngolden sprouts and auspicious herbs, magic fungi moistened.\nDelighting in the nine-returned elixir,\nopening the jade feast—all should be in perfect order.\n\n**To the Tune \"Jade Tower Spring\"**\n\n*For Jiang Daoquan*\n\nThe master drinks the jade nectar’s wine,\nreclines beneath the moon, sleeps among clouds, idly toying with the Dipper.\nTimely, he revolves the mechanism without error—\nthis work depends on the craftsman’s hand.\nA hall filled with gold and jade, existing within nothingness,\nthe nation prosperous, the people at peace, spirit and qi refined.\nThe jade tower’s spring colors are wondrous indeed—\nnot the orioles, flowers, or green willows.\n\n**To the Tune \"Palace of Night Travel\"**\n\nSeeing through worldly toil, bitter and relentless,\ndelighting in purity and leisure, freely singing and dancing.\nLike a solitary cloud, coming and going.\nNo entanglements—attaining carefree ease,\nwithin, self-replenished.\nDay and night, harmonizing dragon and tiger,\nconstantly, the maiden and infant gather.\nCultivating the divine pearl, it emits light from emptiness.\nRadiating brilliance—\nrevealing the original beginning,\nthe master of form.\n\n**To the Tune \"Jade Hall Spring\"**\n\nIdly discussing cultivation—\ncultivation is no trifling matter.\nFiercely abandoning family ties,\nonly then seeking the Great Dao.\nExtinguishing all ignorance,\nlike *Ke*, nurturing the vast.\nWilling to follow human sentiments like a well-sweep?\nDwelling in a wren’s nest, eating scraps—\nnaturally free from vexation.\nA grimy face, disheveled hair,\nthe field of the heart frequently swept.\nMetal and wood mutually engender—\nwithin, the supreme treasure is formed.\nThen, the divine light emits a single ray.\nTreading the clouds, walking...\n\n**Thirty Poems to the Tune \"Treading Clouds\" #2**\n\n*For Immortals Cao, Gan, and Zhang, Dwelling Together in Misty Rosy Grotto*\n\nTwo counties, three immortals,\none heart, dwelling together,\npassing down the profoundest words in turn.\nBy the water-cloud stream, joyfully carefree,\nwithin Misty Rosy Grotto, thoughts forgotten.\nRefining mercury, cooking lead,\nharmonizing dragon, guiding tiger,\nin stillness, uniting the true lords of the three fields.\nThe work complete, riding a crane to pay homage to the Origin—\nin the Great Luo Heaven, becoming immortal companions.\n\n**Further Verses to the Tune \"Treading Clouds\"**\n\nAnother:\nA carefree idler, a careless hero,\nin poverty and joy, worldly matters forgotten.\nBefore the wind, beneath the moon, plucking the heart’s zither,\ndragon’s chants and tiger’s roars come to attend.\nNow hidden in mountain forests, now dwelling in bustling markets,\nurging others to turn their heads—each step is the Way.\nAmid the dust, guiding and transforming, forging good karmic ties;\ncloud companions and rosy friends await in anticipation.\n\n*For Lü Shouzhen*\nThis maiden,\na banished immortal surnamed Lü,\nwilling to trade bones as a merchant.\nDisheveled hair, grimy face—Daoist bearing,\ncloud companions and rosy friends, no ordinary fellowship.\nDo not flaunt your appearance,\na lump of foul decay—\naffection shattered not by axe or adze.\nHeart extinguished, thoughts severed, joy unbounded,\nin the Great Luo Heaven, dwelling in the immortal palace.\n\nAnother:\nSix-petaled flurries drift,\na thousand peaks lie in hidden emerald,\njade blossoms fallen to earth, stirred by the wind.\nThrough curtains and screens, flaunting their freedom,\nbefore men, deliberately displaying auspicious signs.\nThe fisherman dons his straw cloak,\nZiyou’s mood arises,\nthe price of wine in Gaoyang soars.\nWhy do the people rejoice so?—\nnext year will surely be a year of abundance.\n\n*For Feng Shouci*\nThough kin by blood,\nlife and death cannot be crossed.\nFleeting fame, fleeting gain—like drifting clouds.\nAll ties cast aside, as if nonexistent,\non the path of longevity, cultivating the immortal fruit.\nJade doors often opened,\ngolden gates tightly sealed,\nthe spirit pearl veiled, scriptures recited.\nWork complete, lightly ascending, treading the clouds,\nin the Great Luo Heaven, seated in solemn dignity.\n\nAnother:\nReencountering Chongyang,\nlayer upon layer, awakening to the Dao,\nthe lad from Fufeng—why fear aging?\nHarmonizing dragon, guiding tiger, toying with the bright pearl,\nthe bright pearl’s path must emerge early.\nNamed *Yu*, styled *Xuanbao*,\nthe title *Cloud Master* earned as a fine sobriquet.\nThe Wooden Ox’s childhood name: *Shantong*,\n*Shantong* will soon ascend as an immortal.\n\nAnother:\nReturning to Xingping,\nbroadening the path of words,\nsuddenly, interest spent, thoughts turn to home.\nTreading the mossy path, counting the way to Chang’an,\nwishing all would awaken their hearts early.\nWealth and poverty decreed by heaven,\ndescendants’ fortunes inscribed in shadow,\ncalculations set—cease all worry.\nHearing the body is sound, hasten to cultivate;\nwith sincerity, seek a true master’s guidance.\n\n*For the Idle Daoist of Wuwei*\nThe three-topknot *Shantong*, bowing to hear Zhang’s teaching,\nwatching others make offerings—this is not the way.\nDo not envy the fat carp by the river’s edge;\nretreat and cast your net—better than gazing.\nTo dwell in Penglai,\nwhy wait in anticipation?\nDisheveled hair, grimy face, worldly matters forgotten.\nBurning incense, bowing a hundred times to the original heart,\nvowing to follow in the footsteps of Master Pang.\n\n*For Yaji Yao Xuanyu*\nWithin the twin topknots,\nbrightness and fortune concealed,\nthe master’s name worn on the crown—do not alter it.\nLong ago, Zhongli was just

cup and drinks.*\nStruck by inspiration, Yu humbly responds:\nVast and free,\ndetailed and precise,\nwhy must the immortals’ words be so?\n\nThe Mountain Recluse sees himself as a giant turtle-fish,\ngolden scales gleaming like fresh brocade in the sun.\nRoaming clouds and waters at will,\nbody and mind freely given,\nwhy vie to be the foremost adept?\nAll rejoice at the coming of the white-robed one—\nin the mystery within mystery, wine should be shared.\n\n*Master Leads Ma Yu to Beg in the Streets*\nNo need to speak of turtle-hair,\nno need to discuss rabbit-horns—\nthe

settled.\n\n*Again*\nSeizing the soaring crow,\nfirmly capturing the fleeing hare—\nthe two wheels of sun and moon ever conjoined.\nRadiance illumines the cavern-heaven,\npure rain descends like sweet dew.\nDispelling floating clouds,\nleaving only wispy mist,\nimmortals of Penglai often encountered.\nHenceforth, the Daoist name is Dan Yang;\nin time, surely ascending to the Origin.\n\n*For Master Xue (Hidden Head Poem)*\n□ dare lightly transmit,\n□ guard the secret formula,\n□ discourse—how could it compare to ordinary speech?\n□ fields quake with Kan and Li’s gathering,\n□ pearls, each one requiring regulation.\n□ gentleman and fair lady,\n□ suddenly parting,\n□ jade tablet to refine at the Golden Gate.\n□ Ma Yu, born, treading clouds in ascent,\n□ earnestly admonishing you: still the mind-monkey.\n\n*Eight Lyrics to the Tune \"Divining the Scholar\"*\nPeople know Mountain Recluse’s name,\nbut who fathoms Mountain Recluse’s intent?\nThe great form of Mountain Recluse leans on

nature.\n\n*Again*\nI speak for Mid-Autumn,\ndo not celebrate Mid-Autumn’s festival.\nThe outer scene of Mid-Autumn brings no benefit;\nthe inner scene of Mid-Autumn differs.\nWhen the heart reaches Mid-Autumn’s rest,\nthe dust is severed at Mid-Autumn.\nGold meets Mid-Autumn to congeal the Great Elixir—\nnature like the Mid-Autumn moon.\n\n*Again*\nSweeping the Yang Pass road,\nopening wide the Yang Pass door.\n\nThis Yang Pass bears not a speck of dust,\nfit to bid farewell to Yang Pass companions.\nHaving grasped Yang Pass’s delight,\nhow could one dwell in Yang Pass?\nReleasing Yang Pass’s perfected Daoist,\nawakening arises from Yang Pass’s insight.\n\n*Again*\nMaster’s name is Chongyang,\nhaving refined Chongyang’s treasure.\nThe purple decree summons Chongyang to Jade Capital—\nonly then does Chongyang’s excellence appear.\nI arrive for Chongyang’s sake,\nthe hut built for Chongyang’s dwelling.\nEspecially to keep vigil for Chongyang’s observance,\nin accord with Chongyang’s Way.\n\n*Again*\nI met Chongyang and awakened,\nonce tasted Chongyang’s delight.\nRefining Chongyang to extinguish all yin,\nyin adheres to Chongyang’s touch.\nLife and nature gather in Chongyang,\nthe Three Luminaries aid Chongyang.\nWithout reaching Chongyang, one cannot become immortal—\nimmortality is made by Chongyang alone.\n\n*Matching the Master’s Rhyme*\nKarma heavy with many calculations,\nhow could one awaken to hexagrams and judgments?\nDeep gratitude to Wind Immortal for coming especially,\nrousing this dull and foolish one.\nAnger and resentment often bring hardship,\nthe lamp of nature must be made to shine.\nTrue joy, true delight scatter all sorrow—\nmaster and disciple ever companions.\n\n*Song of the Overheated Horse*\nAll day pulling the salt cart,\nwhips and rods striking ceaselessly.\nI sigh—my spirit long suppressed,\nlike a sick horse, how can I ever roam freely?\nBo Le, the master physiognomist, arrives,\nseeing me, he sighs in

roam, roam freely at will.\nRoaming freely, untrammeled, without care.\nMoving or sitting, roam freely,\nfreely roaming as if drunk.\nRoaming wherever one pleases,\nlike clouds, like water.\nAwakened

Toward Penglai (To the Tune of \"Gazing Toward the River\")*\nSeventeen Poems\n*First: Transforming Yao Xuan*\n\nBreaking old paper, stitching a lined robe to ward off wind,\nSitting or lying, no fear

perfection,\nThe seed of celestial immortals enters the white clouds,\nThe cicada’s husk reveals Shan Tong.¹\n\n*Again*\n\n---\n¹ *Shan Tong* (山侗): A reference to the Daoist adept Lu Dongbin in his reclusive aspect.\n\nMa Fengzi, alone savoring the Lantern Festival,\nTrims the life-lamp bright as day,\nLets the moon of the heart shine through the azure sky,\nHolds the sprouts of purple mushrooms in hand.\n\nGolden youths dance,\nJade maidens play their flutes.\nThough the wine of jade nectar is fine,\nSome idle matters still hinder freedom—\nOnly regret the lack of true friends.\n\n*Again*\n\nMa Fengzi, having met with the renunciation of glory,\nBegs for scraps to sustain himself,\nLiving a life of true purity.\nRefining white cinnabar.\n\nLet none mock him—\nHis single-minded resolve is truly praiseworthy.\nTo hear the Great Dao at dawn and die content by dusk,\nPure as ice and jade, flawless,\nHe dares not disgrace his master’s house.\n\n*Again*\n\nMa Fengzi, once lost in the ford of delusion,\nSought an exit but found no way,\nLonging to know the true path up the mountain—\nOne must ask those who have come and gone.\n\nThe Immortal of the Wind arrives,\nSpeaking of good causes in earnest.\nPointing out a true shortcut,\nWithout error, he transcends the red dust.\nDay and night, he feels his master’s grace.\n\n*Again*\n\nMa Fengzi, suddenly recalling his time at home,\nEnduring endless suffering in the fiery household,\nHeart trembling, gall quaking, weeping in sorrow,\nRegretting his late departure.\n\nAfter wailing,\nHe gives thanks to his true master.\n\nReeling from the mundane cage to cultivate the Non-Dual,\nCarefree and at ease, dwelling in the mystery’s subtlety.\nBy fate, one gazes upon the Jasper Pool.\n\nHearing the cicada—\nAutumn cicadas clamor, their voices faint yet long.\nDrinking dew and feeding on air, their song never wearies,\nEach cry revealing the hidden and manifest.\nThis stirs in me a deep disquiet.\n\nAlas!\nIn form, they resemble dung beetles,\nYet transcendently shed their shells like cicadas—\nHow can man bear to obscure the Three Lights?\nHasten to nurture the lead and frost.\n\nThe eighth day—\nTomorrow the ninth, today I visit Dragon Mountain.\nAnticipating the chrysanthemums, I let my hat fall first,\nSpared from Zheng Gu’s myriad lamentations.\nYet in the end, lasting long proves difficult.\n\nMa Fengzi,\nSpeaks of matters one by one:\nThe nature binds to Double Yang, its blossoms fragrant,\nUnwithering for ten thousand years and a thousand ages.\nEverlasting, joy abounds.\n\nNinth Day Chant\nIn celebration of the fine festival, all vie to admire the chrysanthemums.\nThey say Tao Qian deeply grasped its charm,\nMeng Jia’s hat fell, his delight unbounded—\nYet in the end, all falls to emptiness and decay.\n\nMa Fengzi,\nKnows another splendid scene:\nWithin yang, nurture yang—where yang is fostered,\nThe Wooden Ox leads to the pasture of the Ox.\nEverlasting, Double Yang is celebrated.\n\nTenth Day Chant\n\nThis morning’s chrysanthemums,\nPeople see them fading in intent.\nTheir autumn fragrance lingers but a night—\nEnough to draw Zheng Gu’s myriad lamentations.\nYet in the end, lasting long proves difficult.\n\nMa Fengzi,\nSpeaks of matters one by one:\nTen thousand acres of white clouds know their place,\nGolden lotus blossoms never allowed to wither.\nEverlasting, the Daoist’s joy abounds.\n\nAgain\nSeeking the Great Dao,\nNot on distant, winding roads.\nAmid cloud and water, at ease and truly free,\nWith the Mysterious Maiden and Infant as companions, roaming carefree.\nWho can fathom this principle?\n\nMa Fengzi,\nHas awakened fully to the lofty truth:\nHis two feet dance wildly in the streets,\nComing and going, only he is permitted to ride the whirlwind.\nThe bright moon is borne aloft on his staff.\n\nDaoist Friends Build a Hermitage\nQiu and Ma,\nEnter the Dao, forsaking all greed and seeking.\nTo repay their master’s kindness, they constantly bear it in mind,\nThree years of mourning—how could it ever cease?\nWhere is a good place to hide one’s head?\n\nThe old dwelling site,\nDeep gratitude to the fellow cultivator who permitted it.\nOnly wishing that my lord shares my aspiration,\nWith one heart and one virtue, we become one stream.\nTogether we seek Penglai.\n\nAgain\nOutward inversion:\nLove and desire like bitter enemies.\nWealth and honor, glory and splendor—all disregarded,\nWhere human attachments run deep, swiftly withdraw.\nBeyond the material world, cultivate and uphold.\n\nInward inversion:\nTrue fire plays with the clear stream.\nIn the sixth month, frost descends, hemp and wheat flourish,\nIn the three winters, timely rain nourishes the cinnabar mounds.\nCloud-borne steps seek Penglai.\n\nTo cultivate the Great Dao, why dwell in deep mountains?\nAmid the mundane, blending light—all seen through,\nMyriad worldly trivia leave no trace.\nThere is another realm, another state.\n\nMa Fengzi,\nIn leisure seeks more leisure still.\nHe sees a wooden ox roaring past,\nMeets a stone maiden laughing, foolish and dull.\nWith a shout, he enters Chang’an.\n\nAgain\nMa Fengzi,\nKarmic hindrance—stubborn and dull.\nFails to recognize the true offering of grotto-heavens,\nBut deludes himself with worldly rites, false completion.\nHow can his heart and mind be at ease?\n\nBound by external realms,\nHe desires to mold his master’s visage.\nBuilding pagodas, halls, and erecting steles,\nHeedless of the donor’s hardship in giving.\nSin and karma pile like mountains.\n\nAgain\nMa Fengzi,\nConstructs three rooms for a hut.\nBreaking ground, a year of labor,\nSlaughtering ants—lives must be repaid.\nDeath leads to the gates of hell.\n\nMistake upon mistake,\nEven regret comes too late.\nThe karma he forged must be endured,\nScaling mountains of knives and forests of swords.\nHow then to join the ranks of immortals?\n\nLuo Gong climbs a tree beyond the walled garden to beg for verses\nMa Fengzi,\nFails to awaken, corrupts his practice.\nThough secure within the walled garden,\nPoetry and lyrics draw false renown,\nStirring unrest and unease.\n\nBoasting cleverness,\nYet truly unwise.\nAshamed, his hidden self not concealed,\nWasting away, his hair turns white in vain.\nHow then to reach Penglai?\n\nSpring day, a fellow cultivator in Hu County requests\nThe true message:\nThe pitch-pipe sets the spring’s arrival.\nAs the earth-ox is struck in season,\nWhere do the idle sprouts wander alone?\nWho understands this principle?\n\nMa Fengzi,\nRelies on steadfast cultivation.\nJust when both ox and man vanish,\nLimpid and still, he enters non-action.\nThis is the time of bright moonlight.\n\n*Xijiangyue*, Thirty-Four Poems\n**Self-Exhortation**\n\nSeeing through the bitterness of family entanglements,\nJoyfully leaping beyond the village gate.\nIn the beauty of Qin Chuan, I make my hermitage,\nTo dwell forever, forever, forever.\n\nBeyond the material, carefree and at ease,\nNow what need is there to send word home?\nReturning, I would ascend to the immortal capital—\nNo, I will not go, not go, not go.\n\n**To Fellow Cultivator Yun in Chang’an, Who Gifted a Daoist Robe**\nYesterday’s robe was tattered and worn,\nToday I don this new attire.\nIf asked the reason why,\nI show the kindness of a fellow cultivator’s gift.\n\nYet fearing its splendor,\nI cast it aside, no doubt arising.\nA Daoist’s straw cloak and bamboo hat suit best,\nAfter poverty, sound sleep comes easily.\n\nAgain\nWithin the heart, constantly examine one’s faults,\nFrom the mouth, never speak ill of others.\n\nThe world pursues, I practice non-action,\nBegging for food in the streets without shame.\nDaily I feast on jade petals,\nHourly I drink deeply of the elixir knife.\nOne day I’ll lead forth my transformed child—\nThen the Daoist livelihood shall truly appear.\n\n**To Wu Zhigang**\nLeave behind wife and children to study the Dao,\nAbandon qi, wealth, wine, and lust.\nLet attachments and affections forever cease,\nCutting off all sorrow and anxiety.\nLet no delusion briefly arise,\nRoam carefree beyond the material world.\nConstant purity, constant stillness—this is the work,\nFitting the gate of Perfect Realization.\n\n**Again**\nStudying the Dao, do not be misled by guiding and pulling,\nNor should you adorn your appearance.\nOppose worldly customs with non-action,\nYour livelihood like water and clouds, untroubled.\nHow fortunate is the cultivation of merit and conduct,\nYour actions slaying the Three Worms.\nThe spirit-moon of your singular soul crosses Jade Pool—\nOnly then will you know the ease of the extraordinary.\n\n**To the Pure and Unattached One**\nFirst, subdue the heart and extinguish intent,\nSecond, cut off thoughts and forget scheming.\nThird, refrain from speaking of right and wrong,\nFourth, let no worldly passions briefly arise.\nFifth, perfect spirit and qi,\nSixth, uphold non-doing and non-action.\nSeventh, let merit and conduct never falter,\nEighth, transcend the mundane and leave the world.\n\n**To the Bright Moon Unattached One**\nOne strand of scripture, a jade-threaded flower,\nTwo wheels of sun and moon refine and boil.\nThree carts transport into the cinnabar field,\nFour seas traversed in cloud-wandering.\nFive-colored rosy clouds appear,\nThe six senses transformed into blue lotuses.\nThe Seven Perfected gather, the nature round,\nEight-armed vajras subdue goodness.\n\n**Again**\nMaster Chongyang of Earth’s Lung,\nLord Lü specially sent to wander the clouds.\nSeeking hidden mysteries in secret depths, visiting Dongmou,\nHooking us, husband and wife.\nTen transformations, the pear-dividing craftsman’s hand,\nA hundred mornings, the locked-door scheme.\nA thousand poems and songs turn the head back,\nTen thousand kalpas share the immortal’s cup of wine.\n\n**Again**\nUnashamed of disheveled hair and grimy face,\nUnbothered by coarse food and rough clothes.\nUnabashed to beg as a poor child,\nUnenvious of glory and wealth.\nOne day, merit complete and conduct fulfilled,\nHeaven bestows immortal robes and majestic bearing.\nStar-crown and moon-cape, stepping on clouds to return,\nJade pendants chiming with each measured step.\n\n**Again**\nPeople all cling to life and fear death,\nI now recognize death to attain eternal life.\nFew walk this path,\nAfter awakening, boldly leave home.\nDo not say the Mystery and Origin are hard to grasp—\nI see them clearly and easily.\nBid you guard simplicity and shun excess skill,\nHeaven and earth all return to purity and stillness.\n\n**To the Tranquil and Unattached One, Ju Shouji**\nNo need to seek dragon or tiger,\nNor search for the maiden or infant.\nDo not labor over discussions of mercury and lead,\nAll are empty names that delude you.\nOnly keep the heart pure and still,\nNon-action is the accomplishment of merit.\nCompassion aids in condensing qi and spirit—\nThus, the attainment of immortality is certain.\n\n**Again**\nThe Great Dao comes down to six words:\nNaturally pure, still, and non-active.\nOne who can follow this meets the subtle and tranquil,\nWhat need for eyes and ears in seeing and hearing?\nWithin purity and stillness, joy arises,\nNon-action’s merit completes the soaring spirit.\nNaturally step on clouds to Jade Pool,\nThe immortal assembly of the Three Islands and Ten Continents.\n\n**Again**\nSpeak not of departing dragon or blocking tiger,\nNor mention red marrow or yellow sprouts.\nDo not discuss transporting the purple river chariot,\nNor speak of the infant, maiden, or crone.\nCutting off thoughts and forgetting scheming is finest,\nCalming the spirit and nurturing vastness is best.\nNon-doing, non-action—no path goes astray,\nThe enlightened root is priceless in its openness.\n\n**Again**\nGuard simplicity with patience,\nOnce allotted the refined qi of the Three Terraces.\nDragon’s roar and tiger’s howl come and go,\nBright moon and clear wind, carefree.\nFivefold rosy light covers and bears,\nThe spirit-pearl nurtured, departing the womb.\nA single thunderclap, the cavern gate opens—\nOnly then does the mountain rustic find it strange.\n\n**To Ren Shouyi**\nFirst, do not slight the master or disdain the dharma,\nSecond, follow the pure and still immortal scriptures.\nThird, preserve essence and qi to nourish the spirit,\nFourth, brush away all worldly toil.\nFifth, extinguish the karmic fire of ignorance,\nSixth, remove worldly rites and human sentiments.\nSeventh, capture the monkey and horse to forever secure peace,\nEighth, taste the jade nectar’s flavor.\n\n**Again**\nBy rivers and streams, snow enfolds,\nYin and yang’s workings wondrously rare.\nYellow sprouts, auspicious herbs emerge from the subtle,\nA different kind of fragrance and beauty.\nGently grind with jade,\nRefine with divine water, fitting.\nAfter the mountain rustic sips, he ascends to Jade Pool,\nNot conceding to Lu Tong in knowing the taste.\n\n**Again**\nIsland hermits Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma,\nFor their masters, each abandoned glory.\nCarefree and at ease, boundless joy,\nNo talk of high or low.\nUnversed in zither, chess, calligraphy, or painting,\nA bit of livelihood, no error.\nSleeping in clouds, lying under the moon, drinking rosy mist,\nAfter drunkenness, clear and free.\n\n**Again**\nFar, far from right and wrong,\nCast off, cast off all dust and clutter.\n\n**Again**\n\nLet each person willingly untie every grievance,\nStep by step through gentle shallows.\nGoodness ever cherished, lingering on,\nMystery forever unbroken, endless.\n\nBright and clear, this perfect round,\nVast and deep, yet manifest.\n\n**Again**\n\nEvery thing, each kind, recognized in truth,\nEver trembling, ever vigilant.\nHeart and thought, ever fearful of sinking,\nGains and losses, ever diminishing.\n\nDay by day, pure and still,\nMoment by moment, limpid and serene.\nAwake and free, this numinous spirit,\nRadiant and luminous, eternal.\n\n**Again**\n\nMarvel not at the clamor of horses and wind,\nLet human feelings remain harmonious.\nEven in walking, dare to be composed,\nTreading the earth, yet mindful of its pain.\n\nNo action, no striving—subtle efficacy,\nEver pure, ever still—true attainment.\nIn standing, walking, sitting, follow the Kingly Wind,\nHow dare the mind-monkey stir within?\n\n**Admonition to Master Liu and His Wife**\n\nTo follow Xu, Pang, and the ancients,\nSearch your hearts and know this well:\nWith one heart, one virtue, cultivate the Dao,\nThe slightest discord leads to separation.\n\nThree are not as good as two,\nTwo may still debate right and wrong.\nLike solitary clouds or wild cranes, drift east or west,\nHow could the slightest thread entangle you?\n\n**Again**\n\nThough immortals are said to drink wine,\nThey do not drink mere dregs.\nNaturally, the jade nectar’s flavor lingers,\nNourishing the yellow sprout to flourish.\n\nBeneath the moon, before the wind, refreshed,\nRaising a cup of jade blossoms, fragrant.\nDrunk on the scriptures, sated with virtue, visit Penglai’s estate,\nReclining high in the immortal’s chamber.\n\n**Again**\n\nStudying the Dao, yet clinging to rank flesh,\nKnowing well it severs compassion.\nThe five pungents tantalize the palate, fostering desire,\nHow compare to the essence of rice and wheat?\n\nThese two hold the subtle qi,\nIn our gate, vegetarian fare is fitting.\nIf cultivation’s merit and conduct falter,\nHow attain long life and enduring vision?\n\n**Again**\n\nSpeak not of heart, liver, spleen, or lungs,\nSeek not north or south, east or west.\nMention not Zhen, Dui, Kan, or Li,\nThere lies another profound mystery.\n\nDrawing in the rivers Huai and Ji,\nThe stars, sun, and moon shine bright.\nSpirit, qi, and blood flow to the elixir pool,\nThen transcend the mortal world.\n\n**Again**\n\nPractice knows no time unfit,\nEnlightenment brings no shame.\nThe first three threes and the latter three threes—\nI dare not leak the celestial secret.\n\nI guard my flawless jade nature,\nUrge others to awaken like silver silkworms.\nBest to retreat beyond the world, seek profound discourse,\nRecognize that which neither increases nor decreases.\n\n**For Guard-Purity Yao and Guard-Stillness Li**\n\nTo study the Dao, leave the fiery household,\nSeek the mysterious, visit good affinities.\nGuard purity, guard stillness, abandon all,\nBeg for the great convenience within the body.\n\nClouds and water must clarify inner and outer,\nFirmly restrain the willful horse and mind-monkey.\nUnattached to the myriad conditions, spirit complete,\nFulfill the great vow of cultivation.\n\n**For Master Awareness**\n\nSitting in mind surpasses seated meditation,\nWhen the mind is ash, the mind-monkey vanishes.\nThe body like withered wood, naturally at peace,\nBeyond the world, how could anything stain it?\n\nNurture qi without laboring breath,\nPreserve spirit through withdrawal and replenishment.\nDeep in the cloud chamber, eternally continuous,\nA fetal immortal emerges.\n\n**For Master Sun**\n\nStudy the Dao to perfect life and destiny,\nNurture the body, beg for what remains.\nTrue merit, pure and still, verifies the primordial beginning,\nTrue conduct relieves the suffering of others.\n\nBeyond this, nothing to be done,\nThe heart like a wheel’s hub or a quail’s nest.\nCarefree and at ease, seemingly foolish,\nYet passing the Three Clarities’ immortal trials.\n\n**Attending Lord Hu’s Vegetarian Feast**\n\nI prepare harmonious delicacies,\nNaturally sweet upon the tongue.\nNo need for soy, vinegar, pepper, or salt,\nEach taste more fragrant than the last.\n\nFilled to the brim, not shallow,\nThat person, having eaten, grows renewed.\nHollow the heart, fill the belly, strengthen the root,\nAfter satiation, wander the immortal’s courts.\n\n**For Duan Zhi-Yi**\n\nThe Dao concealed, clad in plain cloth,\nHeart kind, mouth far from rich flavors.\nCarefree beyond the world, dwelling in a cloud hut,\nDare not repeat past actions.\n\nCleverness turns to dullness,\nAwareness transforms to simplicity.\nMaster Duan, speak not of stinginess,\nVastly occupying clouds and mist like *Om*.\n\n**Again**\n\nLying transformation surpasses seated transformation,\nIn cultivation, true constancy is prized.\nThe borrowed body cannot become fragrant incense,\nWhy cling to form at the hour of return?\n\nThe secret of ascending revealed in one move,\nImmortality is but the spirit’s light.\nThe celestial palace has no use for foul flesh,\nCarry it to the deep mountains to discard.\n\n**Again**\n\nI wish to speak only of purity,\nLest others waver on the Dao’s path.\nExpounding the dragon and tiger’s departure and return,\nThe initial stage is full of strangeness.\n\nWeary of discussing the infant and maiden,\nLest others misconstrue with wild guesses.\nWho knows the man may birth an infant?\nTurning back, one naturally understands.\n\n**For Master Gu of Hidden Wisdom**\n\n□Gu, the master in appearance,\n□Within, no talk of \"this\" or \"that.\"\n□In the subtle workings of Ren,\n□The Dao is his awakening.\n\n□Also delighting in the mysterious gate,\n□Soaring with jade hare and golden crow.\n□Accompanying you to transform the foolish,\n□□Intent like a fishing net’s count.\n\n**For Cai Wu-Zhen**\n\n□My pomegranates and chestnuts,\n□Yet you must guess the golden core.\n□In plain robes, leading a white-robed one,\n□□Disregarding right and wrong.\n\n□Learning unrelated to the great Dao,\n□□Nurturing the primordial infant.\n□At the Dragon Boat Festival, you emerge from the womb,\n□□How could the seal bear the surname Cai?\n\n**Phoenix Perched on a Wutong Tree (Two Poems)**\n\nFan Li and Zhang Liang, awakened in their day,\nGained favor yet feared, sought retreat’s path.\nIf one clings to fame’s treacherous peak,\nHow could they dwell in Penglai’s estate?\n\nSomeone asked why I left the capital,\nThe Immortal of Fengxian came from afar to guide.\nSuddenly, the numinous brightness has a master,\nFrom now on, enter the gate of eternal life.\n\n**Again**\n\nBeyond the world, carefree, cultivating the nine nines,\nAdmiring joy in poverty, stillness within nothingness.\nNot visiting noble gates, ever inward-turned,\nEscaping the three snares of heaven, earth, and man.\n\nSealing the Zi-Wu gates, true Mao-You,\nWhite tiger, green dragon, facing the phoenix’s roars.\nThe infant on the Buddha’s face wears brocade,\nWorthy to wander Penglai’s immortal paths.\n\n**Moon of Pure Heart**\n\nA single thought breaks the pure fast.\n\n**Craving Love Brings Disaster**\n\nCraving love must bring disaster.\nWhy should numinous brightness part from the Three Terraces?\nStealing peaches—not just two or three times—\nThus banished, cast out from Penglai.\nHow could this compare to pillar-and-beam timber?\nWould immortal essence ever suffer dust’s burial?\nIn the Great Luo Heaven, all is well arranged.\nWhen the golden elixir’s nine cycles complete their work,\nOnce more I shall return—\nSpared the wheel of rebirth.\n\n**Drinking Cinnabar (Two *Shāoxī Sā* Poems, Third of Three)**\n\nA heart of frost and snow, free of striving,\nNaturally untouched by worldly dust.\nEver graceful, sleeves like clouds dance between twin forests.\n\nNine-turned cinnabar births purple mists,\nA stream of white jade nurtures yellow gold.\nOnly regret the mountain recluse finds too few kindred spirits.\n\n**Again**\n\nBeyond the world, cultivating a garden beyond the world,\nProbing mysteries, seeking wonders, discerning the root-source.\nFirmly seize the monkey-mind and horse-will.\n\nFirst gather tiger and dragon into the crucible,\nThen lead mercury and lead back to their origin.\nSpirit congeals, qi knits, nature rounds into wholeness.\n\n**Passing Hanpi, a Daoist Friend Asks for a Poem**\n\nHad I not wandered the clouds to reach Meipi,\nHow would I know this place hides a Jade Pool?\nEach one wonders why I leave no verse behind.\n\nWalls adorned with pearls, steles carved with jade,\nTheir radiance gleams, resplendent with lingering light.\nWhy need Ma Yu compose another poem?\n\n**For Venerable Zhao**\n\n**Teaching in Myriad Ways**\n\nA thousand teachings, ten thousand methods—all to instruct,\nYet how to teach you to sever the dust from your heart?\nOnly upon awakening may you grasp the true cause.\n\nFear of death severs the bonds of love and desire,\nForgetting scheming, qi and spirit naturally pure.\nNon-action, clarity—thus harmonizing with Heaven’s truth.\n\n**Sent to Daoist Friends in Nanjing**\n\nAshamed I lack the karmic tie to visit Daliang,\nNor do I harbor the intent to emulate the worthy.\nYet I ponder the Daoist friends at Yimen Gate.\n\nI, within the encircling walls, temper water and fire,\nWhen will you gentlemen transcend the heat and cold?\nMountain recluse urges: awaken from the yellow millet dream.\n\n**Recalling Hu Zijin of Wuwei Hermitage**\n\nAmong cloud companions, Hu Zijin of Zhongtiao,\nHis golden waves and jadelike ripples cleanse the heart.\nTo this day, his cloud-water robes remain.\n\nNow reading the wondrous record of Wuwei Hermitage,\nEach word within shines upon my lapels.\nHow can these lapels bear such radiant splendor?\n\n**For Immortal Physician Zhao**\n\nWith single-minded devotion, he enters the mysteries, renouncing fame and profit,\nFree of worldly affairs, his qi and spirit clear.\nThe Three Lights gather—everlasting peace.\n\nUnbound by the four seasons, he embodies true creation,\nFive-hued mists of radiance coalesce into form.\nA six-zhu robe hangs as the crane comes to welcome him.\n\n**Again, Thinking of Hu Zijin**\n\nHow fine is Lecturer Hu of Zhongtiao,\nA scholar versed in Dao, enlightened to Chan’s subtleties,\nNaturally attaining such understanding!\n\nThe stone maiden returns drunk to the golden tiger’s cave,\nThe iron ox plows into the fire-dragon’s pool.\nThe fetal immortal plucks the purple magic mushroom.\n\nSeventy years of light fly swift as arrows,\nHalf the night consumed—how grievous the sorrow.\nHow bear the daily onslaught of impermanence?\n\nThen think of climbing the bed, shoes cast aside,\nPondering what beloved one to cling to.\nBetter to roam beyond things, wild as the wind.\n\n**For Immortal Liu the Liberated**\n\nI urge you: study well the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*,\nSeek the immortal’s mold with diligence.\nProfound and abstruse, the principle of serene quiescence.\n\nAbiding in the true and constant, ever responding to phenomena,\nNaturally desireless, also without mind—\nMoving with sun and moon as kindred spirits.\n\n**For Liu Chu Xuan**\n\nThe Dao nears perfection in non-action, non-striving,\nNo need to cast a line from the fisher’s rock.\nEver clear, ever still—a firm foundation.\n\nJade nectar flows, the heart free of cares,\nGolden light irrigates, the nature forgets its schemes.\nChu Xuan, mastering the wondrous, unites the Three Mechanisms.\n\n**For the Pure Wind Recluse and the Bright Moon Recluse**\n\nRefining to the point of no-mind—this is true effort,\nIn the depths of the Jade Hall, playing with the pure wind.\nInverted, upside-down, coagulating crimson.\n\nTen thousand streams of icy springs dry the alchemical crucible,\nA single wheel of bright moon emerges from Gui Peak.\nThe original face ascends to the immortal palace.\n\n**Self-Reflection**\n\nOnce, my scheming heart ran wild,\nSeizing others’ paths, I pressed ahead,\nThickets of thorns grew thick as forests.\n\nHeedless of spirit’s wound, qi’s drain,\nI craved jade heaped high, gold piled deep—\nA walking corpse, bones for company.\n\nNow, my heart moves with compassion,\nSubtle mysteries draw near, profound.\nCloud-sleeved, I dance in jade groves.\n\nIn water, I seek fire upon the wood,\nIn fire, I nurture gold within the waves.\nCloud-kindred, rosy friends—my true companions.\n\n**Presented to the Daoist Assembly**\n\nSerene and simple, yet unwilling to cultivate,\nEver fretting over cold and hunger, flaunting skill—\nLittle knowing warmth and fullness breed desire.\n\nLet pass the days in quiet solitude,\nShun worldly affairs, forsake fleeting glory.\nEver clear, ever still—the Great Elixir ripens.\n\n**In Praise of Immortal Hao**\n\nFierce in resolve, steadfast in practice—Immortal Hao,\nA lone cloud, a wild crane, most free and untrammeled.\nThough my walls are humble, I aspire to his stature.\n\nDaily I refine the heart, simmer the alchemical crucible,\nHourly I stoke the fire, mend the cinnabar field.\nWhen merit is complete, together we ascend to Great Luo Heaven.\n\n**For Old Master Zhang of the Mountain**\n\nCease envying silken curtains and crimson gauze,\nLeaping from the red furnace, azure dust dissolves.\nWithin the mysterious, subtler mysteries await—only the destined may fathom them.\n\nInverting yin and yang, truly lucid and clear,\nNo division between bright day and limpid night.\nA single wheel of intrinsic nature ascends to the cinnabar sky.\n\n**For Nun Ma**\n\nJade Maiden, radiant immortal bearing a jade gourd,\nAmid lotus fragrance, she plays with the whirlwind.\nWithin the Moon of the Western River, she gathers the sprouts of lingzhi.\n\nNinefold refinement complete—joy of boundless longevity,\nThree Fields’ treasures congealed—unfettered and carefree.\nShe welcomes the Immortal’s Guest and ascends to the azure heavens.\n\n**For Master Wang**\n\nSeek not the mystery beyond mystery,\nDaily but scrape away the heart’s human dross.\nIn tranquil leisure and joy, find true companionship.\n\nLeave not a single thing within the numinous terrace,\nNaturally the true gold crystallizes in water.\nThen, with cloud-like steps, ascend the jade peak.\n\n**Transforming the Sleeping Mat**\n\nThe mountain monk of Three-Knot Peak transforms the sleeping mat—\nNoble ones, make no hardship of it.\nThree strips of sturdy cloth suffice in width.\n\nEach length must measure six feet,\nTogether forming eighteen—just right for the body’s repose.\nNo fear of scorching heat or bitter cold.\n\n**For Master Yu the Tile-Pot**\n\nMaster Tile-Pot, in the world surnamed Yu,\nBegging scraps across three thousand leagues,\nAt ease and untrammeled—worthy disciple of the Way.\n\nEver recognizing this as the true livelihood,\nNaturally unbound by the world’s constraints.\n\n**The Moon of Cultivated Nature Shines Upon the Water Flask**\n*For Layman Zhao*\n\nPure, pure—utterly pure,\nClear, clear—profoundly clear.\nDark, dark—boundlessly dark,\nEternal, eternal—unshakably eternal,\nBright, bright—radiantly bright,\nNuminous, numinous—manifestly numinous.\n\n**For Master Wang, in Acrostic Verse**\n*[Ability]* drives the three carts into the treasure vase,\n*[Vase]* flowers blaze in the jade hall’s light.\n*[Light]* shines, startling gods and spirits.\n*[Startled]*, yin demons scatter, essence concealed,\n*[Concealed]* within the cinnabar pellet, nature’s numinosity,\n*[Numinous]* clarity emerges, surpassing all skill.\n\n**Moon Over the Western Tower (To the Tune *Xiang Jian Huan*)**\n*Two Poems Exhorting Daoist Friends*\n\nStroll idly, sit idly, sleep idly,\nNurture the cinnabar field.\nEver blend east and west, south and north in the crucible’s flame.\nDwell in mystery,\nRipples alight,\nWithdraw and replenish.\nFive-hued rosy clouds cradle a celestial embryo.\n\nAgain—\nEver pure, ever still, ever at ease,\nShed the dust of the mundane.\nFreely roam, cloud and stream, seeking Dragon Mountain.\nNectar wine,\nNone yet present,\nNourishes the golden elixir.\nOnce refined, return at Double Yang to join the ranks of immortals.\n\n**Joy of the Tossed Ball (To the Tune *Pao Qiu Le*)**\n*For Yue the Awakened Daoist*\n\nPassions forgotten, thoughts severed—light emerges,\nNaturally manifesting a limpid scene.\nJade blossoms fill the tree, yet leave no shadow,\nWithin which, so fine,\nHangs the mirror of the heart.\nBrilliant radiance discerns right from wrong,\nThis body,\nIn the end, returns to dust.\nThe original face, now purified,\nAwaits, intent,\nThe jade lad’s summons.\n\n**Night Voyage (To the Tune *Ye Xing Chuan*)**\nWhy fear heaven and earth’s dominion over secret mysteries?\nAbiding in profound mechanism, thus poor and indolent.\nGuard the encircling wall,\nLofty yet not short,\nThe horse-wind nature knows no cold or warmth.\nEver burn heart-incense, too weary to hold a scroll.\nWhen will the debt to the master’s grace be repaid?\nOnce merit and conduct are complete,\nReturn to the Silver River,\nCloud-like steps hastening forward.\n\n**New Chrysanthemums (To the Tune *Ju Hua Xin*)**\nDeep in the azure grotto, true scenery hides.\nYellow and white flowers bloom—gold and jade distinct.\nEver auspicious clouds arise,\nSweet dew descends,\nAugmenting fortune upon fortune.\nMeng Jia’s hat falls, Tao Qian’s resolve—\nYet who knows where this gaze is fixed?\nDaily celebrate Double Yang,\nWhen merit is full,\nThe six-zhū robe is bestowed.\n\n**Refining Cinnabar (To the Tune *Lang Tao Sha*)**\nHeaven and water shape Cloud Hermitage,\nFar surpassing a refined monastery.\nCloud companions, rosy friends—daily audience.\nJust like planting pines to summon cranes,\nHow could this be greed?\n\nIf willing to awaken to pure discourse,\nSurely sweet fragrance will come.\nFields and gardens entrusted to sons and heirs—\nTo dwell in Penglai or Yingzhou, first transform the self,\nLest one fall into dissipation and indulgence.\n\n**Transformed Life (To the Tune *Shuang Yan Er*)**\nWith the Perfected One of Double Yang,\nJoyfully parting from the eastern land.\nVisiting the Lungs of the Earth, roaming freely,\nWater and clouds at ease, without sorrow.\nThese attachments—let love and desire cease.\nGuard the root-source, the two-tailed ox.\nCirculate jade mercury, reverse the flow.\nThe golden elixir coalesces—no need for forced cultivation.\nExpound the mysterious discourse, board the prajñā boat.\n\n**Immortal by the River (Two Poems)**\nBegging for scraps of the true living,\nWithout shame, without honor, without glory.\nSurrendering the body—how could it be to feed hungry hawks?\nNor to be devoured by tigers, nor clinging to a false form.\nMyriad dust-laden labors all set down,\nNaturally spirit and qi become numinous.\nHeart-monkey and mind-horse both stilled—\nNo affinity for the bitter sea,\nBut a share in beholding Penglai and Yingzhou.\n\n**The Newly Departed from Chang’an**\nThis great Dao of Longxi,\nSeemingly bound by worldly fetters.\nYet it reports to Tianshui, yearning for purity.\nFrom Pengcheng, returning to true awakening,\nSevering love to enter the gate later.\nMoreover, there is Duan’s innate wisdom,\nAwakening to skillfully transform folly.\nShan Tong, hearing this, attains completeness.\nJoyful as if deeply drunk,\nRecognizing the original thusness.\n\n**To the Wine Steward of Fengxiang #4**\nWhat Du Kang crafted,\nWhat Wenjun of old ladled at the tavern.\nSuddenly recalling Bi Zhuo of antiquity—\nHe once stole some.\nLiu Ling, who loved it dearly.\nLi Bai before the emperor, who once vomited it.\nLe Ba, who rose in mercy to extinguish fire by spraying it.\nThe Duke of Sima, who constantly and earnestly warned of it.\nYet how could they know\nThe noble surname of this steward?\n\n**End of *Gradual Awakening*, Scroll One**\n*(Originally mislabeled as *Bu Suan Zi*)*\n*(The following tune should be *Ta Suo Xing*)*\n*(This tune should be *Yan Gui Liang*)*\n*(Original text contains errors.)*\n\n**End of *Gradual Awakening*, Scroll Two**\nComposed by Ma Danyang of Mount Kunyu\n\n**Twelve *Nanke Zi* for Master Chen the Third**\n\nIn the world yet not of the world,\nDwelling in dust yet unstained by dust.\nLike the lotus untouched by water’s cause—\nAmid ten thousand blossoms, not a petal clings to the body.\n\nNurture the nature within the heart,\nCultivate the spirit within the body.\nEach person’s awakening follows whom?\nOld Pang’s whole household ascended—\nMaster Xu the Perfected did the same.\n\n**[Disordered Dao]**\nI have long renounced wine, meat, tea, and fruit.\nYet by your kindness, you bestowed pears and jujubes upon me,\nAnd so, in gratitude, I composed this disordered verse.\nAwakened to pears and jujubes,\nWhy crave wine or tea?\nNow my life is cloud and water—\nI urge you: leave home, leave home, leave home at once.\n\nI find delight in sobriety,\nWhile you still flee life and death.\nTogether we’ll refine cinnabar beyond the world,\nAnd with ninefold transmutation, step by step through mist and clouds.\n\n**Self-Admonition**\nEradicate thoughts of children,\nBanish attachments to fields and gardens.\nGold, silver, wealth, wife, and kin—\nCast them all aside as if they were nothing.\n\nYet still entangled in worldly affairs,\nAlas, how foolish the nature!\nBetter to abide in pure emptiness,\nFor non-action is the finest skill.\n\n**For Fellow Daoists**\nSweep the mind-ground again and again,\nRemove worldly passions bit by bit.\nLet no pitfalls ensnare Vairocana—\nOnly in constant stillness and purity may the primordial be discussed.\n\nTrim the wick of the nature-lamp,\nLet Caoxi’s breath flow freely.\nLet no coarse gasps disturb the breath—\nDay and night, unbroken, is the true skill.\n\n**For Ma Huaiyu**\nWhen intent stirs, the heart must stir;\nWhen the heart is cleared, intent is cleared.\nIn utter void and silence, silence returns to void—\nSpirit and qi harmonize, mother and child dwell in peace.\n\nSeek not the path of Caoxi,\nNor ask of the tailbone’s gate.\nIn true purity, true stillness, nurture true thusness—\nTrue joy, true leisure, truly the finest skill.\n\n**Again**\nWhy were you joyful yesterday?\nWhy so sorrowful today?\n\n**Rejoicing and Sorrowing**\n\nRejoice when they turn toward the Dao, yearning for the subtle and serene;\nGrieve when they cling to gaudy splendor, so unfit for the Way.\nIf you would seek the wondrous mystery,\nYou must become a beggar—\nUnkempt, dust-streaked, rags hanging loose,\nYet with intent stilled and heart cleansed, this is the ladder to heaven.\n\n**Seventh Night Lament**\nIn heaven, the first embers drift;\nOn earth, autumn arrives in haste.\nThe magpie bridge spans the Silver River, auspicious clouds afloat—\nWhere does the Weaver Girl call for her Oxherd this night?\n\nMaidens leave their chambers, then return,\nYet sorrow stirs where none should be.\nThey burn incense, pray for skill without cease—\nWould they but still their hearts and join the ranks of the immortals!\n\n**Again**\nIn dreams I wandered the wilds,\nA skeleton came to me.\nIts voice was mournful, each cry more pained—\nIt rued the wine, the lust, the wrath, the wealth of its past.\n\nFour poisons bring the body torment,\nYet men’s hearts never turn to ash.\nNow it suffers through ten thousand kalpas of rebirth—\nToo late, it regrets not having sought the Dao, not having become immortal stock.\n\n**Again**\nWang and Ma met,\nTheir bond forged by past karma.\nTaiyuan and Liang Park have already ascended to heaven—\nYet they recall the words left behind, to be passed on again.\n\nObserve mourning for three years,\nHold fast to the heart for five more.\nGuide others to goodness, perfect their deeds—\nThis is how Feng of Fufeng honors the immortal of the wind.\n\n**Again**\nWish only for the Three Elixirs to coalesce,\nWhy fret over silvered temples?\nUnwashed, disheveled, babbling on—\nYet in all twelve hours, diligently nurture the harmonious void.\n\nNo envy for Sima Xiangru’s ambition,\nNo desire to follow Ma Yuan’s path.\nWhat was Feng’s intent in inscribing the pillar?\nNot to cross the Ba River without becoming a divine immortal.\n\n**Again**\nLet not fame outstrip reality,\nBut keep reality as empty as the void.\nHide your mechanism, conceal your depth—feign foolishness,\nCasually ask where the mind-king applies its skill.\n\nLet your nature be the treasure of long life,\nYour body the great crucible of medicine.\nTo refine the elixir, you must drink the purest ghee—\nDrunk, lie upon the jade tower, toying with luminous pearls.\n\n**Again**\nNo envy for those who awaken first,\nOnly sorrow that I remain unwise.\n\nDisheveled and unwashed, the Purple Hut is everywhere—\nThis wandering hermitage finds rest wherever it may.\nUnbound by worldly ties, ever free from entanglements,\nCarefree and at ease, untouched by dust,\nYet the mountain rustic beyond the world knows not the work.\n\nMeeting the true one,\nMaster Chongyang speaks of furnace and cauldron—\nAll lies in the field of the heart.\nThe mountain rustic too recognizes the original truth:\nWhen nature stills and life abides, this is forever my spirit.\n\nFrom now on, inner and outer reverse,\nGradually the Dao shines through.\nThus I compose these verses to exhort many—\nWhoever grasps the beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon draws near.\n\n*Cherishing the Yellow Blossom*\nMatching the Master’s Rhyme\nFor Lord Fan of Chang’an\n\nRenouncing wealth, abstaining from wine,\nThe medicine pouch tied at the elbow.\nEver serene, thus drawing forth tiger and dragon.\nThe heart stirs with great compassion,\nWishing to save all people.\nTransforming ignorance—poems and lyrics like spells.\n\nAvoid the snares of flowers and willows,\nHasten to cultivate divine radiance.\nWithin the jade flask,\nA natural red dog.\nDaily it barks at the azure sky—\nWho knows it fits the mouth?\nFurther, when clouds part, it flies and runs.\n\n**Lyrics to \"Wu Meng Ling\" (Forty-One Poems)**\n\n*For Master Jing*\nBeyond the mundane, Master Jing by name,\nEver vigilant o’er wine, lust, qi, and wealth.\nGradually perceiving his own bias,\nNo need for others—he corrects himself.\n\nSelf-correcting,\nSelf-admonishing,\nHe steps into the inner realm of long life.\n\n*For the Recluse of Penglai*\nSingle-minded, pure, guarding the Dao,\nTen stages bloom with lingzhi grass.\nA hundred deeds held in careful observance,\nA thousand days refine the true treasure.\n\nTrue treasure,\nTrue treasure—\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, his radiance grows brighter.\n\n*Again*\nDo not marvel at my recent bamboo planting,\nNot for love of its verdant hue.\nOnly cherishing its winter heart,\nI naturally transcend the vulgar.\n\nTranscending,\nTranscending—\nWith a steadfast, serene will, he gains immortal blessings.\n\n*For Master Yue, the Enlightened Recluse*\nMaster Yue, the Enlightened Recluse,\nGrasps the secret, mysterious mechanism.\nAll day he strums the zither of the heart—\nThis is the immortal music of Penglai.\n\nImmortal music,\nImmortal music—\nIt resounds through the Hua Mountains of his body.\n\n*Again*\nBeyond the world, a grotto-heaven’s golden rain,\nWatering the ninefold return’s count.\nApe and horse both still,\nThus nature abides and life endures.\n\nLife endures,\nLife endures—\nA fetal immortal is born, soaring aloft.\n\n*Again*\nThe youth of Three-Bun Mountain loves to laugh,\nPreferring weakness to return to one laugh.\nNot that I am thus,\nBut within, there is joyous laughter.\n\nJoyous laughter,\nJoyous laughter—\nTrue joy arises in natural mirth.\n\n*For Master Quan of Jingzhao*\nWives, concubines, children, and grandchildren—first illusion,\nGold, jade, pearls, and treasures—second illusion.\nThird illusion: glory and splendor,\nFourth illusion: the illusory, colored body.\n\nKnowing illusion,\nKnowing illusion—\nPiercing through, the fifth illusion: floating fame.\n\n*Again*\nFirst, escape the boundless fire of the household,\nSecond, escape the snares of fame and profit.\n\nThird, avoid frequent reverence,\nThus fields divide in three segments.\nWorthy of sight,\nWorthy of sight—\nGold and jade congeal in radiant splendor.\n\n*In Gratitude to Master*\nRevered Master of Chongyang, Earth’s Heart,\nYou transformed my hundred-morning barred door.\nYet how repay your grace?\nThree years of vows within these four walls.\nEating plain,\nEating plain—\nBody draped in spirit-luminous paper cloth.\n\n*Again*\nThe four—Tan, Ma, Qiu, Liu—all transcended,\nEach in weakness, no distinction between.\nMeeting parted in Dongmou,\nThus sought seclusion in West Qin.\nCultivating seclusion,\nCultivating seclusion—\nSimply to perfect utter poverty.\n\n*For Layman Fu*\nThis layman bears the surname Fu,\nUnattached to glory, wealth, or nobility.\nBeyond the world, he cultivates,\nEntrusted with the wondrous in his nature.\nEntrusted,\nEntrusted—\nToward Peng Isle he shall advance.\n\n*For Li the Enlightened Daoist*\nEnlightened Daoist, surnamed Li,\nShe cast aside worldly ties and vulgar rites.\nResolute as any man,\nShe sought the mystery within the mystery.\nMystic principle,\nMystic principle—\nOnly within the Moon of West River.\n\n*For Layman Ji*\nAwakened to how brief life is,\nShe combed the lice and nits from her hair.\nDelighting in the Dao, abiding in truth,\nIn all twelve hours, she refined the self.\nRefining the self,\nRefining the self—\nTo become the guiding thread of immortals.\n\n*For Master Before Me*\nForlorn, my mist-and-cloud companion,\nFirm in resolve, you bid me farewell.\nUnmindful of my solitude,\nAbiding alone in these bare walls.\nBare walls,\nBare walls—\nAll day, without feeling or thought.\n\n*Again*\nIntent on nurturing seclusion within walls,\nNeither right nor wrong is spoken.\nAll day, feigning foolishness,\nTeasing out the joy within.\nJoy within,\nJoy within—\nSuch is the living work of Mountain Youth.\n\n*Again*\nThe horse stumbles, the ape raves—impure dream,\nThe tiger strides, the dragon coils—pure dream.\nNo action, no effort,\nNature abides, life endures—immortal dream.\nImmortal dream,\nImmortal dream—\nQi congeals, spirit coalesces, no dream remains.\n\n*Again*\nJewel palace, golden gate, jade lock,\nSeeking to search the drifting clouds.\nA shadowless little key,\nTurns the pivot and passes through.\nPasses through,\nPasses through—\nThus, neither ascent nor descent.\n\n*For Layman Jia of Chang’an*\nThis layman bears the surname Jia,\nAwakened to the body’s illusory nature.\nSwiftly he turned toward truth,\nBeyond the world, he perfected pure blessings.\nPure blessings,\nPure blessings—\nWithin, why need he hold the ritual goblet?\n\n*For Song Zhirong*\nJoy washes away affliction,\nIn clarity, no dust vexes.\nTrue qi pervades the Three Fields,\nCongealing into lapis lazuli and agate.\nAgate,\nAgate—\nThus, refining gold to mend the brain.\n\n*For Elder Quan Zhiwei*\nElder Quan cast aside ten thousand entanglements,\nThe horse of intent, the ape of mind—stilled at once.\nIn profound silence and clarity,\nThe formless delights all who meet.\nDelight,\nDelight—\nNature like the clear wind and bright moon.\n\n*For Master Liu*\nFailing to greet its head upon arrival,\nHow could one follow its tail to see the end?\n\nGazing upward, ever higher it grows,\nDelving deeper, more solid it becomes.\nSolid,\nSolid—\nAwakened, each and every insight pierces through.\n\n*For the Yuan Brothers*\nVirtue flourishes in the Yuan brothers,\nAdorned in moon-embroidered robes and star-crowned hats, their will fulfilled.\nI urge them to further cultivate,\nRefining the elixir furnace with matchless cinnabar.\nMatchless,\nMatchless—\nSecuring a place among Penglai’s immortals.\n\n*Further*\nA message for the Daoist priests of the Two Palaces:\nIn daily practice, sever worldly affairs.\nRefine the furnace with white cinnabar,\nGazing inward at the inner realm.\nGazing,\nGazing—\nAt this moment, the Mountain Recluse attends.\n\n*Further*\nA message for the Daoist assembly of Zhongnan:\nEarly sow the seeds of good karma.\nPreserve the qi and spirit,\nHarmonizing the Black Tortoise and Red Phoenix.\nRed Phoenix,\nRed Phoenix—\nTransmuting into a golden elixir, towering high.\n\n*Further*\nNow halt that person,\nLest they wander recklessly another step.\nAbiding daily in true constancy,\nNaturally, the divine pearl will be beheld.\nBeheld,\nBeheld—\nTogether as companions of eternal life.\n\n*For the Recluse Xie*\nThis recluse bears the surname Xie,\nUnattached to wealth, honor, or glory.\nFiercely he entered the Mystery Gate,\nRestoring the grotto-heaven’s terraces and pavilions.\nTerraces,\nTerraces—\nWhere flowers bloom, never to fade.\n\n*Further*\nWandering like clouds and water,\nHe surveyed the Eight Rivers of Qin.\nNot like the rafters of a hall,\nWhere ten thousand vibrations stir the divine water.\nDivine water,\nDivine water—\nThis is the true water of the Mountain Recluse.\n\n*Further*\nBeyond the world, a thatched hut nestled among bamboo,\nA single meal of cold porridge and leftover gruel.\nYet joy resides within,\nRecalling the Wind Immortal’s admonitions.\nAdmonitions,\nAdmonitions—\nNurturing the candle of numinous clarity.\n\n*For the

will be fulfilled.\nFollow your lot and go with the flow,\nEver content in knowing sufficiency.\nSufficiency,\nSufficiency—\nSeizing the three-legged golden crow.\n\n*Five Watches to Layman Zhao*\n**First Watch**\nIn solitary vigil, guard within,\nThe precious land plowed through with clouded toil.\nSecretly sowing purple mushroom sprouts,\nNaturally, the grotto-heaven is flawless.\nFlawless,\nFlawless—\nKan’s tiger and Li’s dragon in union.\n\n**Second Watch**\nIn solitary vigil, guard within,\nClouds unfurl across the starry sky.\nSun and moon exchange their

Daily**\n\nNobles gather idly day by day,\nAfter meals, their eyes meet in silent gaze.\nThey fix their hopes on Ma and Feng’s words,\nDaring not lightly disclose the profound mysteries.\nAlways guarding their qi and spirit,\nCarefully harmonizing the Dragon and Tiger’s steps.\nSlowly refining the Ninefold Returning Elixir,\nEach ascends as an immortal beyond the clouds.\n\n---\n\n**Twelve Lyrics to \"Ten Thousand Years Spring\" (To the tune *Dian Jiang Chun*)**\n\n**I. Why Cultivate?**\nWhy pursue cultivation?\nThe Wind Immortal’s hook draws forth a tower piercing the clouds.\nThe numinous sprout flourishes—\nRevolving the True Mother,\nNot the hand that stirs the broth.\n\n**II. Who Has Not Erred?**\nSmall faults—who is without them?\nA misplaced word calls for sealed lips.\nRanked behind the others,\nHow can one remain as before?\nOnly by drifting with the wind.\n\n**III. One’s Own Garden**\nIn one’s own garden,\nDay and night alike demand reconstruction.\nThe yellow sprout flourishes—\nLonging to carry cloud-mother,\nYet where does one find idle hands?\n\n**IV. The Formless**\nThe formless—each person,\nSuddenly opens the golden mouth.\nDiscerning before and after,\nOne must cast off the old,\nAnd grasp the primordial to depart.\n\n**V. Lament for All**\nAlas for all,\nWave upon wave, kalpa upon kalpa, chasing fame and profit.\nWhen will it end?\nOnly when the light in their eyes falls to earth,\nDo they awaken to regret.\n\n**VI. Though You Have Children**\nThough you have children and grandchildren,\nWho can substitute in your stead?\nTears at parting from life—\nWhat taste of home remains?\nThe thought alone shatters the heart.\n\n**VII. I Urge You All**\nI urge you all:\nIn the dust, do not vie for profit sharp as an awl.\nLet your heart be first—\nDo not deceive heaven and earth,\nFor regret comes too late.\n\n**VIII. To Escape the Wheel**\nTo escape the wheel of rebirth,\nDo not hope your children will substitute.\nDo not shed tears—\nThe true flavor of the Daoist path\nIs to first shatter the bonds of love.\n\n---\n\n**Dreaming of a White Brush**\n\nLast night, the Mountain Recluse\nDreamed of wandering Peng Isle, meeting Zhong and Lü.\nIn the study, a few items—\nA single pure white brush,\nNot inferior to Meng Tian’s craft.\nFar surpassing Jiang Yan,\nIts five colors never tarnished.\nIn its fitting use,\nIt writes the heart’s awakening,\nWorthy of the Three Clarities’ summons.\n\n---\n\n**Winter Solstice: Yang Revives**\n\nAt the winter solstice, yang revives,\nWelcoming spring, the yellow sprout breaks through snow.\nPeople marvel at its earliness—\nFragrant as lingzhi,\nJade-ground, finer than mortar and pestle.\nSteeped in divine water,\nIt naturally dispels yin’s depletion.\nThe Golden Lad reports:\nA treasure of unsurpassed rarity—\nAfter sipping, one roams Peng Isle.\n\n---\n\n**To Chen Zhiming**\n\nChen of Earth’s Lung,\nWhite hairs reveal his extraordinary distinction.\nNone compare—\nA scion of seclusion’s lineage,\nWho would bear the dust’s burdens?\nFiercely abandoning family ties,\nHe sought the mysteries beyond the world.\nWith a heart and mind purified,\nHe naturally irrigates\nThe Supreme Unity’s harmonious qi.\n\n---\n\n**To the Monk Repairing the Pagoda at Xingguo Temple**\n\nA lofty monk beyond the world,\nSerene and deep, a true Chan sanctuary.\nA true Chan sanctuary—\nHeart without clutter,\nPrinciples ever searched and swept.\nHis jade nature crystal-clear,\nEverywhere he is unobstructed.\nEverywhere unobstructed,\nFree from restraint or fetters,\nHe raises a golden pagoda.\n\n---\n\n**To Ning Jieyuan, Who Yielded His Hermitage Gate (Supervised by a Lyric)**\n\nTan, Ma, Qiu, Liu—\nEach steadfastly dwells in his own hermitage.\nIn their practice,\nThey know not the gate’s form,\nYet there is one Master Xu.\nEagerly awaiting good tidings,\nThey hope for a glance of favor.\nIf not mistaken,\nThey will ascend the cloud path—\nHow dare they forget the grace of their patron?\n\n---\n\n**Exhorting Daoist Friends**\n\nDeparting, returning,\nReturning, departing—when will it end?\nLaughable indeed—\nEntangled in profit and fame,\nHow many robes have they changed?\nI urge you all:\nEarly preserve your primal yang.\nDo not waste it—\nForm it into a treasure,\nAnd ascend to Penglai Isle.\n\n---\n\n**On Li’s Hermitage, Named \"Tranquil Joy\"**\n\nEver guarding the moving hermitage,\nEver pure, ever still, ever joyful.\nEver bearing the load,\nDay by day enduring,\nNaturally ever in harmony.\nTrue joy, true delight,\nResponding to things, the true constant remains.\nTruly indestructible,\nThe true thusness shines—\nAttaining the true noble rank.\n\n---\n\n**On Lord Li’s \"Indolent Pavilion\"**\n\nA pavilion of indolence beyond the world,\nLeisurely dwelling, at ease, acting without contrivance.\nActing without contrivance,\nNaturally awaiting the pact,\nHeart and kidneys intertwined.\nThe two qi form the body,\nCongealing the numinous elixir.\nThe numinous elixir—\nSilver radiance covers it,\nAs one unfurls cloud-riding feet.\n\n---\n\n**Thirteen Lyrics to \"A Cloud Over Mount Wu\"**\n\n**I. To the Third Lay Practitioner**\nRevolving the clear spirit’s realm,\nPerfecting cultivation, illuminating the grotto-heaven.\nOn the nine-tiered terrace, auspicious mist gathers,\nSeated upright in the Azure Radiance Pavilion.\nOpening the jade forest’s elegant feast,\nDelighting in the depths within.\nThe roaring golden tiger plays in waves,\nStartling the mercury into a turtle.\n\n**II.**\nThe Jade Maiden opens the golden hall,\nThe Metal Lord seals the jade pass.\nTruly pure, truly still, nurturing the fetal immortal,\nClouds penetrate between Kan and Li.\nGreedily gazing at the numinous light above and below,\nForgetting the *zhi*, *hu*, *ye*, *zhe*.\nThe spirit pearl emits ninefold radiance,\nRiding a crane to the immortals’ abode.\n\n**III.**\nThe Red Child feeds on the Green Mother,\nThe Scarlet Serpent devours the Black Tortoise.\nAuspicious light and propitious qi may form robes,\nYet one must still hold fast.\nGuiding and coaxing the Alchemical Girl and Infant at play,\nTightly sealing the Jade Pass.\nA wheel of nature’s moon gleams in the clear night,\nCloud-stepping to visit the Three Maos.\n\n**IV.**\nRadiance’s friends, free from worldly cares,\nCloud’s companions, cut off from worldly affairs.\nQi and spirit conjoin in purity’s clarity,\nLaughing as the Great Elixir forms.\nBest to pluck the azure peach,\nOffering it to Peng and Ying’s immortals.\nTogether we celebrate the Double Ninth,\nOpening a feast to share.\n\n**V.**\nDo not call them master and uncle,\nSee them as brothers.\nRefining the heart to patch the Jade Capital,\nWhy seek audience with dukes and ministers?\nStrumming the heart’s zither to prolong life,\nDrinking the medicinal dose, abstaining from wine.\nOn the jade terrace, jasper flowers bloom—\nTogether we tread the misty radiance.\n\n**VI. To the Hu Brothers, Immortals**\nSkilled at grasping the bronze sword,\nAble to hold the white jade cup.\nWith hollow heart and solid belly, nurturing the jasper gem,\nA single thunderclap from level ground.\nStartling the Three Corpses and Six Bandits,\nThe golden lotus blooms in fire.\nNaturally, a numinous youth appears—\nCloud-stepping through the Great Void.\n\n**VII.**\nFurnace-nurtured, the elixir of long life,\nGarden-opened, unfading flowers.\nTo sate hunger, pluck the numinous sprout in turn,\nTo quench thirst, drink the flowing radiance.\nLeisurely watching the jade toad’s glow,\nSuddenly seeing the golden turtle leap.\nBoth play upon the azure lotus,\nHow could the phoenix calendar arrange the years?\n\n**VIII.**\nDrunk, reclining in the lapis lazuli canopy,\nLeisurely gazing at the kingfisher curtain.\nNaturally, worldly cares vanish without trace,\nThe treasure tripod’s jade flowers replenished.\n\n**IX.**\nHeart’s incense stirs with fiery devotion,\nDrawing forth phoenix dance and qilin flight.\nDragon coils, tiger leaps—sporting the divine pearl,\nCinnabar congeals, hastening to the immortal capital.\n\n**X.**\nThe yellow crane slumbers amid the pines,\nThe azure simurgh perches by the jade-green stream.\nThe white ox lies wearied upon purple lingzhi,\nThe vermilion phoenix roosts in Jasper Pool.\nOnly the numinous youth plays at will,\nWandering freely in wanton delight.\nThrough heaven and earth under the bright moon,\nThe perfect true work manifests.\n\n**XI.**\nWithin the grotto, heaven and earth transform—\nSerene, the gaze knows no end.\nTiger and dragon battle in the white clouds,\nNo trace of their coming or going remains.\nThe Maiden and Infant, restless,\nVie to bear Kunlun’s summit.\nJade and jasper shatter the spirit-embryo’s shell—\nMounting the crane, they depart for Penglai.\n\n**XII.**\nJade thread pierces the three cavities,\nGolden needle penetrates the nine barriers.\nNaturally, the inner countenance appears,\nCloud sleeves lean upon the crimson balustrade.\nGazing upon the resplendent jade blossoms,\nSuddenly a blue-robed servant calls—\nA decree from the Purple Tenuity descends,\nSummoning to Penglai, where the immortal register is already prepared.\n\n**XIII.**\nThe candle of nature flames emerald,\nThe incense of the heart wafts purple smoke.\nThe lamp of life knots true jade flowers anew,\nThe eye of wisdom beholds the golden lotus.\nThis rustic charm of the mountain hermit\nStems from Master Fengxian.\nOne day, the ninefold cyclical elixir completes—\nThe Jade Emperor summons the immortal minister.\n\n**XXI Lyrics to \"Sumuzhe\"**\nIn Chang’an, playing with iron horses,\nA Daoist companion requests a song.\n\n*Horse and wind,*\nAwakening to the mystery’s principle.\nNot toward eaves and beams,\nDo you plan your household’s affairs.\nWhat joy in following Fengxian?\nLightly swaying sleeves,\nShaking forth pure, beautiful sound.\n\nSurpassing the swift steed,\nUnfettered by bonds.\nNo love for silver saddles,\nSpared the whip’s lash.\nSuddenly, the tinkling chime’s melody arises—\nAt ease and carefree,\nStraight into the azure vault.\n\n**II.**\n*Lively tunes,*\nNeatly combed.\nWondrous skillful hands,\nAfter enlightenment, display some art.\nEach one comes unburdened,\nEvery one alert—\nEven lice and nits must be few.\n\nZhang Dayou,\nLi Gao the old—\nSeeing my windblown madness,\nClap their hands and laugh aloud.\nWho could fathom this mechanism?\nReversing age to youth,\nInside and out, all turned upside down.\n\n**To Zhang Shandao**\nThe ears, a gate—\nThe heart, vexed and troubled.\nDay by day, sorrow,\nUnnoticed, the countenance ages.\nThe eyes, watching the gate, invite illness early.\nThe mouth, a gate of misfortune—\nVirtue lost, the body perishes.\n\nThe nose, the mysterious gate,\nConnects to the Great Dao.\nIn daily use, be diligent—\nGentle breath is best.\nTransmitting through the nine palaces, it becomes the supreme treasure.\nLong vision and long life,\nCloud-stepping to return to Penglai Isle.\n\n**Returning to Laizhou, Then Back to Ninghai to Bid Farewell at the Graves**\nThis return—\nFor what reason?\nNot for livelihood,\nNor for sons and daughters.\nNot to boast of glory in five-brocade trousers.\nRecalling toil and labor,\nI specially bid farewell at the graves.\n\nWhen pouring libations,\nOpen the earthly realm.\nNine generations ascend to heaven,\nTogether forming a fellowship of immortals.\nNot that cultivation is hard to save—\nWhy offer three sacrificial beasts,\nOr ten thousand rites of worship?\n\n**Parting from Hometown**\nForsaking glory,\nDonning tattered robes.\nNurturing the false to honor the true,\nTea and rice must still be sought.\nForgotten are former kin and acquaintances.\nThis parting from homeland,\nFreely roaming at will.\n\nMaster of the self,\nMust cherish and guard.\nThe Six Bandits and Three Corpses—\nWield the sword of wisdom, strike again and again.\nEntice the numinous youth to leap and dance.\nTrue joy, true leisure—\nThe Great Dao achieves the infinite.\n\n**Exhortation to the Daoist Community of Chang’an**\n\nIn the bitter sea,\nThe Four Great Elements toil.\nVying for profit, contending for fame—\nEach bears it with patience.\nYet they squander their primordial yang,\nLeaving only the wheel of rebirth ahead.\nWhat scheme can break its grasp?\n\nWithin the Daoist gate,\nTranscend the Three Realms.\nThe Supreme One’s kerchief enfolds all—\nThose who awaken wear it gladly.\nMind purified, heart cleansed, no hindrance remains.\nNurture the numinous root,\nAnd life and nature endure forever.\n\n**On Attending Funerals**\n\nA subtle word,\nDeeply worth speaking.\nWhen the hare dies, the fox grieves—\nThe cry of kindred is mournful.\nDo men rejoice at another’s passing?\nWhen the great limit comes,\nNone are spared.\n\nTurn your head,\nSeek the secret formula.\nFiercely abandon worldly ties,\nStill the monkey-mind again and again.\nRefine the golden elixir, gather the white snow.\nWhen the nine cycles are complete,\nEternally free from birth and death.\n\n**Parting from One’s Children**\n\nStepping out of the mundane cage,\nNo bonds remain.\nFallen and dissolute, yet ever mindful—\nEach day, contemplate impermanence.\nFourteen sons and grandsons, all cast aside.\nCarefree and unbound,\nWind and moon are my companions.\n\nWith gourd on my back,\nIron staff in hand,\nThe flask holds nectar,\nWithin, the magic mushroom blooms.\nThirst quenched, hunger sated, lifespan lengthens.\nHeaven aids the true wind—\nA voice from Penglai calls.\n\n**The Harm of Wind**\n\nMeeting King Wind,\nWind transmits to me.\nWind howls fiercely,\nWind shatters worldly ties.\nTossing wind and whirlwind, fire and water entwined,\nWind’s child dances wildly,\nWind’s charm idly chanted in harmony.\n\nFollowing the wind’s path,\nFacing the wind, I sit.\nAfter drinking the true wind,\nI lie down on the pure wind’s pillow.\nSpreading benevolent winds, merit grows vast.\nI vow to uphold the wind,\nWithin the wind, karma is fulfilled.\n\n**To Master Ma**\n\nEver fond of wandering,\nSuch is Ma Yu.\nFortunate to meet the Hua lineage—\nAt first sight, like kin.\nFrom this day, bowing in kinship,\nGrateful for your kindness,\nAll day, idly following.\n\nHear my words, brother,\nHeed my counsel.\nDo not fret for sons and grandsons—\nThey have their own fortunes.\nWish you’d swiftly still the heart, illumine the nature’s lamp.\nSeize this tranquil ease,\nCultivate future blessings.\n\n**To Magistrate Yan of Hu County for His Gift of Noodles**\n\nMaster Yan,\nKindly gave me noodles.\nPersonally playing the cook,\nSkillful hands kneaded and softened.\nGently rolled into jade threads,\nPlaced in the pot,\nBoiled in water and fire together.\n\nFragrance arises,\nA fine meal is made.\nFour equal portions,\nEach without depth or shallowness.\nTo sate hunger, nine cycles are needed.\nAfter eating, wander the clouds,\nEverywhere practicing kindness.\n\n**Wind Arises**\n\nHarm-Wind Wang,\nUphold-Wind Ma.\nEach follows their own wind,\nAll abandon worldly ties.\nChanting beneath the pure wind and bright moon,\nSeeking wind within wind,\nDiscovering the elegance of true wind.\n\nFollowing the wind’s path,\nPlaying with the wind,\nEverywhere wind spreads,\nForming the priceless true wind.\nGrasping the wind’s whirlwind, holding the jade goblet,\nGalloping in wind’s grace,\nTogether riding wind and clouds.\n\n**Self-Admonition**\n\nNot stingy, not greedy,\nNot deceitful, not cunning.\n\nNot clinging to family ties,\nNot speaking the tongue of home.\nUnattached to worldly affairs, unentangled in falsehood.\nNo composing of poems, no daring to preach or convert.\nAspirations grow ever loftier,\nThe heart turns ever humbler.\nClouds and waters at leisure,\nWithin, nurturing the priceless inner elixir.\nJoy abides in carefree play.\nWhen asked of name and surname,\nWeary, one answers: \"Uphold-Wind Ma.\"\n\n**Again**\nMeeting wind immortals, the heart awakens.\nNo self, no other—\nNo love, no hatred, no jealousy.\nAll women and men share the same father and mother.\nDisciples of the Three Teachings\nAre all my masters.\nDelighting in quietude, fond of song and dance.\nBy day begging for scraps,\nBy night lodging in the fields of sorrow.\nGuard the upper, middle, and lower cinnabar with constant secrecy.\nWhen the ninefold work is complete,\nThe cloud-path to Penglai Isle opens.\n\n**Begging in Nanjing**\nThrough teahouses, into taverns,\nBack alleys and main streets,\nDaily wandering without cease.\nOnly to escape hunger and cold, still not avoided.\nPassing days as fate allows,\nHands outstretched without weariness.\nMay all people\nHold kindness and goodness.\nTo give even a single coin\nIs to practice kindness.\nDo not mock the mountain rustic for his lack of discernment.\nWithin, nurturing the numinous clarity,\nHe possesses the proof of long life.\n\n**To Brother Li, Who Again Considers Leaving Home**\nMaster Li,\nStruggling to part from the mundane.\nGone, then returned,\nShattering the jade of Kun Mountain.\nSpilled water cannot be gathered again, a broken string cannot be rejoined.\nNothing accomplished,\nOnly stirring up empty froth.\nRegretting past wrongs,\nIlluminating the candle of true nature.\nFire extinguished, smoke dispersed,\nLet no poison linger in the heart.\nLonging to join the carefree company of Wind and Ma,\nWait until the years deepen,\nAnd see through to his innermost heart.\n\n**Admonition to Brother Li**\nA lamb’s skin,\nA tiger’s essence.\nScheming to harm others,\nDay and night without rest.\nThough fierce, would you devour your own child?\nCease your bluster,\nTemper your true nature.\nKin or not kin,\nAcquaintance or stranger—\nClouds and waters at leisure,\nEver wandering within and without.\nThree daily meals sought by begging.\nWhen ignorance is utterly extinguished,\nThat is *pāramitā*.\n\n**Begging in the Hometown Streets**\nTo sever family ties,\nAn axe must be used.\nSplit asunder the mountain of gratitude,\nHow could one consent to mend it again?\nFiercely extinguish the heart’s embers, seek the way out.\nAt ease and free,\nRecognize a place of quietude.\nOnly when conditions align\nCan awakening occur.\nChange your garments,\nThe Daoist robe of nothing but hemp.\nDo not be startled by begging in the hometown.\nWhen ignorance is utterly extinguished,\nYou will step straight into the azure heavens.\n\n**Matching the Master’s Rhyme**\nThe gate of purity,\nThe door of softness and weakness.\n\n**The Household of Forbearance**\nForbearance as family tradition,\nSimplicity as public trust.\nNo action, no striving—this is the path of life.\nAt ease and free,\nClouds and waters tread the way.\nCut off cleverness,\nEmulate the dull and slow.\nSteadfast and drifting,\nNo idle thoughts arise.\nFace unwashed, hair unkempt, body like dust.\nAll things forgotten,\nFit to ascend the Three Pure Ones.\n\n**Li Gongshi’s \"Indolent Pavilion\" Verse**\nNo combing the hair,\nNo washing the face.\nHunger within,\nYet eating wearies the heart.\nNo illness, yet idle sleep, the body too lazy to turn.\nWhen guests arrive,\nBreath still heavy with indolence.\nNo burning incense,\nNo chanting prayers.\nFallen and dissolute, indulging to fulfill this life’s vow.\nDaily practice neglected—how can merit appear?\nWhen the purple summons arrives,\nThe Great Dao’s non-action is revealed.\n\n**Huaining Baron’s Gift of Shoes**\nA clear elder’s cap,\nThe baron’s shoes.\nMeeting Shan Tong,\nA meaning most extraordinary.\nIt lets me stand head-to-tail with heaven and earth.\nGazing up and down,\nNo discord, no shame.\nGaining this cause,\nBoundless joy.\nStepping out to welcome guests,\nWhat fear of impropriety?\nDelving deeper into its profound essence,\nUp and down in harmonious flow,\nReady to ascend into the azure heavens.\n\n**Eighteen \"Auspicious Partridges\"**\n**Sent to the Daoist Assembly at Huaqing**\nA wall encircles the cave’s celestial realm,\nAuspicious qi and propitious light ever entwined.\nThe white deer cradled, ever at ease,\nThe green ox’s back, a place for idle rest.\nThree years since I last visited Mount Li,\nNearly four since parting Hua Peak.\nCloud friends and mist companions must wonder at me—\nHow could they know this is where golden lotuses bloom?\n\n**Admonishing Daoist Friends**\nThough the pure and void are fine, clinging to family ties,\nBy what cause can one ascend to heaven?\nBearing the mountain of gratitude while discoursing on the Dao,\nDwelling in the sea of suffering yet clenching fists.\nIn the den of right and wrong, merit is hard to achieve;\nAmid the thicket of fame and gain, how can fruit be perfected?\nIf you do not turn back to seek the way out,\nHow can you simply become an immortal?\n\n**Dwelling in a Walled Hut**\nWinter without fire, embracing primal yang,\nSummer without clear springs, drinking jade nectar.\nNo wax candle burns—yet the candle of nature shines bright,\nNo aloeswood incense—yet the heart’s incense rises.\nThree years barefoot, three years of vows,\nOne resolve for the azure heavens, one resolve enduring.\nGuarding the mountain’s simplicity within these walled confines,\nNo debt to repay—why harm the Wind King?\n\n**Passing Willow Ford**\nMeeting Chongyang at Fengning in the sea,\nWestward into the pass, unrestrained and wild.\nDelighting in Plum Creek’s Willow Ford,\nJoyfully roaming Bamboo Path and Apricot Blossom Hill.\nQin’s plains spread like brocade, fit for spring slumber,\nWei’s waters stretch like silk, striking the long day.\nEndless sublime scenes, unending verses—\nCommand an artisan to paint them, rivaling a celestial realm.\n\n**Ode to Tea**\nLu Tong’s seven bowls already ascend to heaven,\nBrushing aside snow, yellow buds mock the sleeping immortal.\nThough \"banner and spear\" are peerless,\nThey still rely on water and fire to forge a fine bond.\nRabbit-hair cups warm, golden buds unfurl,\nCrab-eye froth churns, jade springs pour.\nYesterday’s cup dispelled lingering wine—\nTo this day, the spirit soars, unable to sleep.\n\n**Living in the Hermitage**\nLet idle visitors come—what harm?\nOnly fear idle talk of short and long.\nTrue joy, true leisure—no debate,\nMost subtle, most wondrous—beyond discussion.\nIf right and wrong are spoken, spirit and qi scatter;\nAt the first word of fame and gain, virtue is forgotten.\nBetter to still the heart in silence,\nNaturally, both self and other find cool clarity.\n\n**To Supervisor Han the Third**\nA man’s resolve lies in his words,\nYet words that betray the heart bring only fleeting harm.\nThough Han the Third is distant from Ma the Second,\nHow can Ma the Second forget Han the Third?\nNurturing a family is sweetness within bitterness,\nPursuing the Dao is bitterness within sweetness.\nSweet and bitter, bitter and sweet—awaken to this,\nLeave the fiery household, dwell in the cloudy hermitage.\n\n**Receiving a Letter from Home**\nThe letter arrives, hastily opened,\nJust as I paste the window to block the wind.\nMy intent cannot follow yours,\nThe heart of the Dao differs from the worldly heart.\nMy practice is not yet complete for the great thousand,\nClouds and waters must wander to the Great One’s palace.\nTell my sons, grandsons, brothers, and nephews—\nIf another letter comes, cast it east of the wall.\n\n**Again**\nHeart’s incense kindled, singing the incense hymn,\nTrue joy, true leisure—enduring delight.\nSuddenly, the brows are free of profit’s shackles,\nWhy fear the body’s bonds of fame?\nOnce a pampered son of the household,\nNow a man who has left his home.\nAt this point, ever at ease in the distance,\nWhat matter the babble of words?\n\n**Gifting Fellow Daoist Companions**\nWhere does cultivation require effort?\nSwiftly sever the laggard horse and mad ape.\nFirmly grasp, firmly seize—let the five colors arise,\nMomentarily pause, momentarily stay—avoid the three paths.\nA slight indulgence leaks the elixir of spirit,\nA brief laxity withers the jade nature.\nIf wine, sex, anger, and wealth still linger in the heart,\nAttaining the mysterious and wondrous is as if nothing.\n\n**Again**\nThough the Daoist lacks wealth, sex, and wine,\nHow to remove that single spark of ignorance?\nWhen evil thoughts do not arise, return to purity,\nWhen provoked, do not contend—realize the primordial.\nWhere self and others begin, sorrow knows no end,\nWhen smoke and fire fade, joy remains.\nTo learn immortality, one must endure humiliation—\nDo not let that true suchness burn away.\n\n**Upon Hearing a Hometown Person Arrived—Words in Lieu of a Letter**\nCutting iron, severing steel—I do not think of home,\nForever ending doubt, forever abandoning home.\nFeet treading white clouds, seeking feathered guests,\nStaff bearing the bright moon, visiting immortals’ abodes.\nThe gardens and halls of home are not my dwelling,\nBeyond the world, Penglai is my true home.\nAt ease and free, without lingering cares,\nWhy speak again of the old home?\n\n**Again**\nEveryone pursues the Dao, all toiling,\nEach with lofty hearts, yet none with lofty aspirations.\nSmoke and fire unremoved breed resentment and malice,\nWorldly passions unsevered give rise to greed and gluttony.\nTo seek the mysterious and wondrous, dissolve the three karmas,\nFiercely strike at the root with a single blade.\nEver pure, ever clear, ever forbearing,\nNon-action, non-striving—join the ranks of immortals.\n\n**Again**\nOnce shackled by the yoke of profit and fame,\nDelighting in the waves of the bitter sea while wearing its chains.\nChildren and grandchildren at home like jade shackles,\nWives and concubines before the eyes like golden fetters.\nHow did Ma Yu awaken from such delusion?\nMeeting Fengxian, he cast off the yoke.\nSeeking leisure within leisure, finding leisure’s delight—\nNow, how could I willingly don those chains again?\n\n**Again**\nI urge you—do not ask of past causes,\nSimply turn back, and it is your destined affinity.\nNot pondering the floating life makes sudden awakening hard,\nSlightly knowing the peril of emptiness brings you near the good cause.\n\nTo enter the Dao without intent requires no distinction,\nTo seek the Mystery with purpose is to have affinity.\nSince ancient times, all immortals have departed the world—\nHow could one find good causes while dwelling at home?\n\n**Again**\nThe Wind Immortal’s wind harms to reveal the true wind,\nLeaving behind a family tradition to harm the wind.\nThe adept Qiu Xian of Tongmi succeeded him,\nWhile Shantong and Ma Yu answered the call of Feng.\n\nI urge you—do not dream within a dream,\nLearn from me to seek the wind within the wind.\nIf asked the cause of wind, I plainly declare:\nCast off the worldly, embrace the wind of the heart.\n\n**For Lord Li of Doumen**\nNo need to seek masters far and wide—\nThe immortal within is your true master.\nTruly pure, truly clear, truly the ultimate principle,\nMost subtle, most wondrous, the truest master.\n\nIf love and hate remain, the Dao is hard to seek;\nWith self and others still present, bowing to masters is in vain.\nIf your will cannot follow mine,\nHow can my heart be your heart’s master?\n\n**Again**\nThe wonders of Qin Chuan are truly extraordinary,\nBest of all is the treasure-hidden land of Zhongnan.\nBamboo paths and plum streams brim with vital essence,\nPhoenix nests and dragon caves exhale auspicious light.\n\nCloud hermitages gather clouds in every place,\nMany Daoist friends discourse on the Dao’s profundity.\nThe name of Liujiang Village has now changed—\nEveryone speaks of the Village of Immortal Meetings.\n\n**Four Poems on the Raft of Immortal Encounter**\n\n**For the Pure Wind Recluse**\nDiligently cultivating beyond the world,\nMeticulously sweeping the heart within.\nGradually severing worldly ties,\nGently penetrating the Mystery’s depths.\n\nThe great elixir forms, numinous and bright,\nThe divine radiance shines, resplendent.\nFortunately meeting the raft of immortals,\nSteadily returning to Penglai Isle.\n\n**Matching the Master’s Rhyme**\nThe Three Lights firmly anchor the Lower Primordial,\nThe Six Perfections purify the Middle Realm.\nThe Nine Cycles’ Upper Primordial lamp\nIllumines the moon of eternal life.\n\nUnceasing brightness, day and night,\nRadiance flows in an unbroken stream.\nRevealing the embryo immortal,\nTranscending life and death this time.\n\n**For Master Yan**\nStill the heart, cut off right and wrong,\nEradicate intent, remove self and others.\nFree from wine, lust, anger, and wealth,\nEscape the wheel of life and death.\n\nAuspicious light weaves precious blossoms,\nMysterious dew forms pearl-like drops.\nNaturally meeting the raft of immortals,\nYou may then ride the clouds.\n\n**Again**\nWith fame achieved, it is good to still the heart,\nWith profit attained, one may turn back.\nMonkey and horse no longer run wild,\nDragon and tiger unite in embrace.\n\nAlways keep the jade gate open,\nNever let the golden pass leak.\nWhen the Nine Cycles’ great elixir is complete,\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, the spirit remains clear and refined.\n\n**Twelve Poems on the Hardship of Family Life**\n\n**For Ning Bogong**\nFamily life is hardship, a pit of fire deep.\nMyriad dusts bury one, unbearable to endure.\nMeeting the Wind Immortal, seeking beyond the world,\nCultivation is good—refining yin and yang.\n\nPure and clear, one sees gold in water,\nRadiant light shines, veiling the precious peak.\n\nFamily life is hardship, constantly busy.\nBusy here, busy there, until impermanence arrives.\nBecoming a yin prisoner, dwelling in the ghostly abode.\n\nCultivation is good, never busy,\nLeisurely guarding the true constant.\nWith completion, the jade cavern awaits.\n\nFamily life is hardship, providing for others.\nClothed and fed, yet still complaining of poverty.\nScheming with cunning, losing one’s true nature.\n\nCultivation is good, living as a leisurely person,\nNaturally caring for the Dao, not for poverty.\nRefining the stubborn heart, nurturing the ultimate truth.\n\nFamily life is hardship, like a bee’s devotion.\nGathering flowers to make honey—for whom is it sweet?\nIf not cautious, caught in the spider’s web.\n\nCultivation is good, becoming a wind devotee.\nThe tongue produces jade-like nectar, sweet as ambrosia,\nNourishing the yellow sprout, free from entanglement.\n\nFamily life is hardship, especially greedy.\nWith wealth abundant, still craving high office.\nFacing danger, no means of escape.\n\nCultivation is good, free from greed.\nHiding one’s light, concealing traces, fearing fame.\nIn non-action, escaping life and death.\n\nFamily life is hardship, clinging to worldly ties.\nPlotting livelihoods, hoping for a thousand years.\nYet this mortal body is not long enduring.\n\nCultivation is good, forming good affinities.\nWith merit complete and conduct fulfilled, no need to count the years.\nBecoming an immortal, for the will is steadfast.\n\nFamily life is hardship, without end or limit.\nOne day, the body dies, becoming a yin prisoner.\nFacing King Yama, no freedom remains.\n\nCultivation is good, with a clear path.\nWith three thousand merits complete, one is no prisoner.\nBecoming an immortal, attaining freedom.\n\nFamily life is hardship, delighting in opposition.\nConstantly pondering the peril of life and death,\nFearing the past, encircled by the fire’s courtyard.\n\nCultivation is good, abiding in non-action.\nThe divine pearl’s radiance pierces the curtains,\nRevealing the spirit child, majestic in appearance.\n\nFamily life is hardship, without respite.\nPerilous and dangerous, like a game of encirclement.\nControlled by others, no prayers avail.\n\nCultivation is good, most rare and wondrous.\nThe maiden and infant vie to ride tiger and dragon,\nOffering the embryo immortal, phoenix and qilin.\n\nFamily life is hardship, for wife and children,\nEnduring right and wrong, glory and disgrace.\nWhen the limit arrives, how can one bear it?\n\nCultivation is good, with a son in the south.\nThe divine elixir shines, abandoning the thatched hut,\nFeasting in the Jasper Pool, virtue fully sated.\n\nCultivation is easy, severing ties is hard.\nAt first, understanding is most difficult.\nLike impermanence, breaking through is arduous.\n\nWith the heart awakened, no doubts remain.\nRealizing the past hardships of family life,\nLearning to be an immortal—what difficulty is there?\n\nPonder the subtle and wondrous, reflect on worldly ties,\nSearching both with precision.\nKnowing emptiness, turn firmly to the Dao.\n\nWith a pure heart and intent penetrating the Mystery,\nNaturally, one understands without words.\nAttaining non-action, becoming a great immortal.\n\n**Two Poems on the Command to Untie the Pendant**\n\n**Matching the Ancient Rhyme**\nShantong awoke sharply,\nFollowing the master’s teachings.\nRealizing the past—all was not, not.\nCorrecting the root source,\nAwaiting sun and moon to arrive together in the pot.\nPenetrating the Mystery Pass, aligning with the principle of the Recluse.\n\nDragon’s roar and whistle, able to move and stop,\nCutting through delusion with the sharp blade of wisdom.\nRefining the divine elixir,\nHeld in a golden plate, offered as a humble gift.\nPresenting it to the Wind Immortal, delighting the original master.\n\n**Again**\nSubduing the strong, tempering the sharp,\nConstantly examining one’s faults.\nAbiding in the true constant, no need for seated meditation.\nBefore others, act small,\nWithout intent to act grand.\nWithin kan and li, tiger sleeps, dragon rests.\n\nNeither hating nor loving, without self or others,\nWhat worry of misfortune or calamity?\nAt ease and carefree,\nSinging in harmony with cloud companions and rosy friends.\nClaiming leisure—how many are there like us?\n\n**Three Plum Blossom Songs**\n*Presented to Master Bai*\n\n**I.**\nEscaping the dust, *Tuochenzi*,\nFleeing life and death.\nBeyond the world, carefree as clouds and waters.\nAwaken true compassion,\nAwaken true compassion.\nSilently nurturing true work,\nEver self-aware.\nLuring the flood-dragons, summoning tigers and rhinos.\nA lamp in water, its light enduring.\nCultivating lingzhi,\nCultivating lingzhi.\nBearing it to Penglai,\nWholly offering it to my master.\n\n**II.**\n*Presented to Fellow Disciples*\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month,\nDragon coils, tiger crouches.\nLet not the horse and ape steal a glance.\nQi and spirit revive,\nQi and spirit revive.\nThe spirit-turtle at the sea’s bottom,\nObeying the breath through the nose.\nThe maiden and youth unite in clouds.\nLonging to set forth on the road to Penglai.\nRefining the rivers and lakes,\nRefining the rivers and lakes.\nOnly when the golden elixir is formed,\nWill you know the solitude of jade nature.\n\n**III.**\n*Presented to Elder Master Li*\nHow to discern,\nBewildered by false pretenses?\nClinging to family ties—when will it end?\nEnsnared by the clamor,\nEnsnared by the clamor.\nMen of iron,\nMelted in the furnace of fire.\nSuddenly awakening—impermanence is no small matter.\nLeaping from the mundane cage, seeking the subtle mystery.\nJoyful and carefree,\nJoyful and carefree.\nKan’s tiger, li’s dragon,\nDescend into the jade gourd.\n\n---\n\n**Three Songs of Remembering Wang Sun**\n*In Response to Perfected Lord Chongyang*\n\n**I.**\nWith a pure heart, step by step entering the Mystery Gate,\nWith a still mind, gently nourishing the root.\nSuddenly hearing the wordless discourse.\nNature unobscured,\nA single spark of spirit-light enduring through ten thousand kalpas.\n\n**II.**\nStriding through Chang’an’s clouds, departing and returning,\nA myriad golden lotuses blooming in fire.\nDrinking the *daogui* surpasses muddy ale.\nTwo or three cups,\nWashing away the mundane heart—what calamity remains?\n\n**III.**\nHemp robe and paper jacket enduring winter’s cold,\nWarm chambers and red stoves never glanced at.\nRecognizing the correct principle, just so.\nQi and spirit at peace,\nForming the non-doing elixir of nine revolutions.\n\n---\n\n**Foolish Guo Lang**\n*Presented to Perfected Lord Chongyang’s Nephew, Wang Zhouchen*\n\nCease your greedy pursuit of fame and profit,\nCease your attachment to wife and child.\nAvoid the suffering of samsara’s wheel,\nBecome a foolish simpleton.\nIn purity, naturally enlightened to the Dao,\nSpirit and qi naturally intermingle.\nUpon achieving merit, ascend to the Jade Emperor,\nRiding cloud-drawn chariots.\n\n---\n\n**Golden Plantain Leaf**\n*Presented to Xu Anshen*\n\nIf you wish for spirit’s clarity and luminous purity,\nSwiftly untie the knots within the heart.\nThen do not endure the scorching flames of family ties,\nAbandon wife, children, and property.\nDisplaying cleverness—why not embrace simplicity?\nGuide the dragon and tiger, do not rush them.\nNaturally awakening to the immortal’s wondrous formula,\nThe original truth never perishes.\n\n---\n\n**Green Jade Tablet**\n*Presented to Dyer Master He*\n\nThe boundless fire-yard constantly enshrouds,\nLike a drunken dream, hard to discern.\nFlaunting cleverness is no playful jest.\nContending for wealth, vying in anger,\nClinging to wife and child—\nIn the end, what will you gain?\nAs if falling into the pit of impermanence,\nThen urgently seek the subtle mystery.\nNurturing the spirit-root with true fire.\nLimpid and profound,\nRealizing the primordial origin,\nThe great elixir formed,\nThe celestial decree arrives.\n\n---\n\n**Two Regulated Jests**\n*Matching the Master’s Rhyme, Presented to Lords Zhang and Ma*\n\n**I.**\nJesting,\nDiscussing the subtle.\nIn the moon, the silver toad leaps on the fifth day.\nAt midnight, the golden rooster crows within the sun.\nKan’s tiger, li’s dragon encircle.\nSuddenly encountering the maiden and youth’s summons,\nTogether guarding the elixir furnace, clear and complete.\n\n**II.**\nSteep mountains,\nIllumined by rosy clouds.\nA single spirit-pearl ever emitting radiance.\nEndless auspicious qi perpetually enshrouding,\nWith more wispy propitious smoke curling.\nThe Three Pure Ones specially dispatch the Azure Lad,\nReporting that the work of non-doing is essential.\n\n**[Ten Lyrics to \"Magnolia Flower with Reduced Characters\"]**\n*Matching the Rhyme of the Four Immortals: Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma*\n\n**I.**\nFortunate encounter with the Wind Immortal’s personal teaching—\nQiu, Liu, Tan, Ma.\nParting Shandong,\nClouds and waters of Qin’s rivers stir boundless longing.\n\nPoverty pure, joy untainted,\nAt ease and carefree, without artifice.\nThe gate of purity,\nExpounding the family’s tradition to align with sacred scriptures.\n\n**II.**\nImmortal Qiu, master of mysteries,\nHiding traces by Pan Stream, unknown to all.\nImmortal Liu, penetrating wonders,\nForever dwelling on Zhongnan, shedding myriad entanglements.\n\nImmortal Tan, steadfast in rectitude,\nAspiring to poverty’s purity, cultivating great stillness.\nThe mountain rustic of Three-Knot Peak,\nWishing to dwell within enclosing walls, yet yielding to indolence.\n\n**To Xu Yuanzhi**\nDivine elder’s scion,\nBone and frame beyond mortal comparison.\nFiercely casting off worldly ties,\nBeyond the mundane, seeking the mystery upon mystery.\n\nHeaven enduring, earth eternal,\nWalking jade, flying gold ever in hand.\nNurturing the yellow sprout,\nHenceforth named \"Azure Radiance\" in Dao.\n\n**To the Recluse of Mist and Rosy Clouds**\nA banished immortal, suddenly awakened,\nWealth and honor cast aside without a glance.\nChanging robes,\nDaoist garb and cloud-wrapped sash trailing long.\n\nTaming the ape, seizing the horse,\nNo longer parading fine appearances—maiden and youth conjoined.\nJade nature without dust,\nFittingly called \"One Scattered Amid Mist and Rosy Clouds.\"\n\n**III.**\nImmortal Tan, master of rectitude,\nAwakened to the ever-true, refining jade nature.\nMa Yu, the mountain rustic,\nVast and boundless, as if afflicted by the wind.\n\nImmortal Liu, master of wonders,\nGrasping the true of long life, perfectly clear.\nImmortal Qiu, master of mysteries,\nCultivating perpetual spring in a land of unending day.\n\n**IV.**\nAbiding in uprightness, master of rectitude,\nDaoist name \"Ever-True,\" truly recognizing the highest.\nAt ease and carefree,\nSmashing the gourd by the cliff to draw water.\n\nAbiding in mystery, master of wonders,\nDaoist name \"Ever-Living,\" truly perfected.\nTake care not to depart first,\nBut accompany Ever-Spring Qiu Chuji.\n\n**V.**\nMa Yu, the mountain rustic,\nLearning the Dao should cast off love and desire.\nYet entangled in poetry and verse,\nHow may merit be achieved to manifest the Purple Tenuity?\n\nHow to awaken fiercely?\nWithin these lyrics to \"Magnolia Flower\" it is told.\nA hundred bows to the poetry demon—\nNo longer as before, reversed and confused.\n\n**VI.**\nPoetry and verse as transgression,\nObstructing my leisurely immortal vocation.\nSuddenly awakened, heart startled,\nAs if treading thin ice over a deep abyss.\n\nThen setting aside brush and ink,\nInstead cherishing qi and spirit in mutual embrace.\nIndolent and idle,\nNon-action, non-doing—this is Ma’s Way.\n\n**Farewell to Nanjing (Character Dissection)**\n□ today I take leave,\n□ dwelling at ease in Golden King’s abode.\n□ the gate opens,\n□ within, no one returns again.\n\n□ gold refined into treasure,\n□ the infant’s veins grasp agate and cornelian.\n□ with the mountain rustic,\n□ departing for Penglai and Yingzhou to pay homage to Lord Lü.\n\n**Passing through Jingyuan Town**\n□ soldiers humiliated me,\n□ amid the forest of halberds, who could resolve the calamity?\n□ eloquence sharp as a blade,\n□ wood and earth harmonized—this is Lord Xia.\n\n□ now purified and liberated,\n□ hare and crow of the sun live together.\n□ incense burning below,\n□ the grateful one sounds the fish-drum and zhang.\n\n**Hanging Golden Lamp**\n*To Master Chongyang’s Nephew, Wang Zhouchen*\n\nSevering all attachments,\nLight born within the heart, lustrous and bright.\nSuddenly transformed,\nEndless wondrous scenes.\n\nThis esoteric marvel—teach the worthy to reflect.\nThe inner visage must swiftly be ordered;\nAfter awakening, the division of mortal and sage.\nFrom the primal, numinous clarity,\nWithin the fire, the true force burns strong.\nThrough tempering and refining,\nEmerges purity within stillness.\n\n**Dripping Gold**\n*For Master Cai*\n\nA wanderer at ease in water and cloud,\nWood and metal conjoined, no longer sundered.\nFrom this, Infant and Maiden recognize their knowledge—\nBehold the color within the formless.\nTiger and dragon battle beside Caoxi’s stream;\nWithin the tripod and furnace, refine the yellow and white.\nWho has tasted the great elixir’s completion?\nMaster Cai alone is worthy.\n\n**Virtue Repays Resentment (Zhaojun’s Grievance)**\n*For Wu Zhigang*\n\nImpetuous nature now becomes patient,\nIntent stilled, the heart naturally stills.\nHatred and love both forgotten,\nAll heat and cold severed.\nTiger withdrawn, dragon coiled—light gleams;\nThe elixir congeals, jade lads invite.\nSleeves dance forth from Kunlun’s ridge,\nBound for Peng’s estate.\n\n**Golden Rooster Crows Ten Heads**\n*Transforming Li Zhongda*\n\nHooking the leviathan demands bait,\nCast fragrant lure, ever tuning the line.\nVast and unbound, heedless of the deceptive waves.\nNo need to flee—\nI’ll bind you fast as glue.\n\nThe golden hook cast, ever stirring,\nIf he turns his head, lead him to the mystery.\nThus shall he surely become immortal.\nPay homage to the Three Pure Ones—\nAll arises from my golden rooster’s crow.\n\n**Again**\n\nDay after day, ever heralding dawn,\nWho knows that all err?\n\nRelentless in greed, deceitful and false,\nNature and life both forgotten—\nWealth and lust breed cunning.\nEvil karma boundless, hidden virtue scant,\nWhat awaits is no small matter.\n\nWhen the appointed hour arrives, Fengdu summons,\nGhostly messengers seize you in wrath—\nYet still you heed not my golden rooster’s crow.\n\n**Again**\n\nDay after day, ever heralding dawn,\nYet men remain heedless, searching for mystery.\nDiligently cultivate goodness, turn the light inward.\nSee through this fleeting life,\nThen cast aside worldly ties.\n\nThe nine-curved bright pearl fits its nine apertures,\nThreaded like ants drawn to flame—\nPierce through, and the work is done.\nBound for Penglai’s isles,\nAll arises from my golden rooster’s crow.\n\n**Again**\n\nWithin the fiery household, flames ever burn,\nAnxious for children, your visage withers.\nOthers fret for you in vain.\nI offer poems and verses,\nHoping your heart awakens.\n\nThe unforeseen impermanence is no small thing—\nAwaken, then seek the mystery.\nThe clouded path to Penglai holds the crucial pass.\nRefine the golden elixir,\nAll arises from my golden rooster’s crow.\n\n**Again**\n\nOutward cleverness is no true grace,\nInward cultivation—even a little—is most wondrous.\nTrue Suchness, a single gleam of the Three Lights.\nKindle the incense of the heart,\nAuspicious mist will gather.\n\nIf the wise man Li Si awakens,\nFrom nothingness arises something—\nProfound and boundless.\nThe fetal immortal dances, sleeves swaying with radiant light.\nMounting the crane, soaring into the void,\nAll arises from my golden rooster’s crow.\n\n**Again**\n\nYou are by nature an immortal—why not awaken?\nHeed my counsel: worldly ties are small.\nLeap from the bitter sea of delusion.\nA single spark of spirit,\nYet trapped by dust’s snare.\n\nBeyond the world, still the heart to fathom the mystery,\nEver pure—\nDragon coiled, tiger withdrawn.\nThe divine elixir congeals, radiance ascends.\nReverse aging, restore youth,\nAll arises from my golden rooster’s cry.\n\n**Again**\n\nAs dusk’s fading light dims, why not awaken?\nGather your heart, turn the light inward.\nSwiftly seek the mystery,\nHasten in cultivation—\nLest the sun sink beyond reach.\n\nCultivating immortality beyond the world is no pretense,\nRecognize early the hook in words, the bait in speech.\nSwallow a little of the poetic lure,\nLeap from the sea of delusion,\nAnd grasp my golden rooster’s cry.\n\n**Again**\n\nHaving been granted entry to the Dao,\nThe fire pit runs deep—best leap boldly.\nA man’s word should hold no falsehood.\nTake care not to hesitate,\nLest others mock you.\n\nSever worldly ties, return swiftly,\nUnlike the crane leaving words on the stele.\nFrom here, Ma Yu ascends to gaze afar.\nI urge you, my brother,\nNever forget my golden rooster’s cry.\n\n**Again**\n\nThe mountain rustic of Sanji laughs heedlessly,\nLeaving home and hearth, needlessly courting sorrow.\nAnxious for others’ lives, he forgets his own path.\nAll day lamenting for others,\nYet neglecting his own Dao.\n\nOne might cast a hook and seek the catch,\nBut first, endure the trials of fire and strife.\nBear shame, endure disgrace, and warn again and again.\nI urge you, good sir,\nAwaken early to my golden rooster’s cry.\n\n**Again**\n\nWhen I was permitted to enter the Dao,\nI thought you, sir, held no deceit.\nI urged you to cast aside worldly ties early.\nA slight delay,\nAnd you compose melodies of the many palaces.\n\nIf you but turn your head, how fine it would be—\nJoyful and carefree, holding a cup in laughter.\nBeneath the moon, plucking the lute, incense curls.\nSearching for the mystery,\nYou’ll find another golden rooster’s cry.\n\n---\n\n**Subtle Wonders #2**\n*For Steward Pang and Magistrate Zhao*\n\nA trifling wonder, most extraordinary—\nWithin the raging flames,\nMushrooms of immortality grow naturally.\nJade tiger and golden dragon\nGuard the Three Fields’ treasure in secret.\n\nThe elixir refined through nine cycles, the Azure Lad reports,\nThen receives the Purple Tenuity’s decree.\nClad in the six-zhu robe,\nMounting the crane, he returns to Penglai’s isle.\n\n---\n\n**Dao Attained, Returning #3** *(Two Poems, to the tune of \"Ruan Lang Gui\")*\n\n*Dao Attained, Returning*\nThe cultivator rejoices in knowing.\nWithin the pine peak’s shadow, delighting in stillness,\nWhy sing wanton verses?\n\nThe maiden stirs, tiger and dragon follow,\nPlowing clouds through Kan and Li.\nThree thousand merits fulfilled, bound for Jasper Pool,\nHis divine radiance and form wondrous.\n\n---\n\n**For Scholar Yue (Hidden Head Poem)**\n\n□ Years of bitter resolve, seeking no marvel,\n□ Few find the seeker.\n□ Swift awakening, a faint smile,\n□ Splendor vainly schemed.\n\n□ The master reclines,\n□ The maiden flourishes,\n□ Auspicious clouds encircle the palace.\n□ The mind-seal transmitted, faithfully upheld,\n□ The spirit soars freely.\n\n---\n\n**Welcoming the Immortal**\n\nSun’s crow, moon’s hare,\nRacing through Zi and Wu—never resting.\nTiger follows dragon, dragon follows tiger,\nEast and west they traverse,\nEver the luminous path of jade.\n\nThe maiden sings, the infant dances,\nWithin the jade hall, gold presides.\nClouds as companions, rosy hues as lovers,\nCarefree and at ease,\nOpening the gate of Perfect Truth.\n\n---\n\n**Cloud-Girdled Waist (Girdled Skirt’s Waist)**\n\nOn Kunyu’s peak, Master Danyang,\nTruly blessed, met the Wind Immortal.\nThis life fulfills a past vow,\nVisiting Qin’s riverlands, dwelling at Earth’s heart,\nForge a bond most true.\n\nLi pure, Kan still—water births fire,\nInfant and maiden slumber,\nTiger and dragon sleep.\nSpirit congealed, qi gathered, divine light appears,\nMounting the cloud chariot,\nPiercing the auspicious mist,\nTo ascend and pay homage to the Origin.\n\n---\n\n**Ascending the Gate of Immortality** *(Two Poems)*\n\nMaster, ah Master,\nMaster Chongyang!\nAbiding in the mystery,\nIn stillness, pure.\n\nRaising the golden lotus, the jade flower community—\nWho knows this?\nTransforming all,\nGradually returning to the Dao.\n\nThis Fengxiang—\nNot enlightenment, nor folly.\nDiscerning false from true,\nSlightly enlightened.\n\nPonder deeply,\nHeart opened, doubts dispelled.\nRecalling the master’s example—\nNone surpass him.\n\n**Again**\n\nHard, ah hard!\nLeaving home is hard!\n\nSever love and hate—\nhard to cast off the dust.\n\nAbiding in non-action, in purity and stillness—\nhard from start to end.\n\nLike death itself—\nwhat could be harder?\n\nDiscoursing on the Mysterious Origin,\nexpounding subtleties—\nall to be heard by others.\n\nYet if a young novice\ncomes forth to inquire,\nthen one must open the path of words,\nguide them forward.\n\nI cannot\nensure their journey ahead.\n\n*Gradual Awakening Collection, Scroll the Lower, Concludes*\n\n*(Tune: \"Pounding Silk\")*\n*(Tune: \"Spring of the Crabapple\")*\n*(Tune: \"The Return of Ruan Lang\")*",

point, ever at ease in the distance,\nWhat matter the babble of words?\n\n**Gifting Fellow Daoist Companions**\nWhere does cultivation require effort?\nSwiftly sever the laggard horse and mad ape.\nFirmly grasp, firmly seize—let the five colors arise,\nMomentarily pause, momentarily stay—avoid the three paths.\nA slight indulgence leaks the elixir of spirit,\nA brief laxity withers the jade nature.\nIf wine, sex, anger, and wealth still linger in the heart,\nAttaining the mysterious and wondrous is as if nothing.\n\n**Again**\nThough the Daoist lacks wealth, sex, and wine,\nHow to remove that single spark of ignorance?\nWhen evil thoughts do not arise, return to purity,\nWhen provoked, do not contend—realize the primordial.\nWhere self and others begin, sorrow knows no end,\nWhen smoke and fire fade, joy remains.\nTo learn immortality, one must endure humiliation—\nDo not let that true suchness burn away.\n\n**Upon Hearing a Hometown Person Arrived—Words in Lieu of a Letter**\nCutting iron, severing steel—I do not think of home,\nForever ending doubt, forever abandoning home.\nFeet treading white clouds, seeking feathered guests,\nStaff bearing the bright moon, visiting immortals’ abodes.\nThe gardens and halls of home are not my dwelling,\nBeyond the world, Penglai is my true home.\nAt ease and free, without lingering cares,\nWhy speak again of the old home?\n\n**Again**\nEveryone pursues the Dao, all toiling,\nEach with lofty hearts, yet none with lofty aspirations.\nSmoke and fire unremoved breed resentment and malice,\nWorldly passions unsevered give rise to greed and gluttony.\nTo seek the mysterious and wondrous, dissolve the three karmas,\nFiercely strike at the root with a single blade.\nEver pure, ever clear, ever forbearing,\nNon-action, non-striving—join the ranks of immortals.\n\n**Again**\nOnce shackled by the yoke of profit and fame,\nDelighting in the waves of the bitter sea while wearing its chains.\nChildren and grandchildren at home like jade shackles,\nWives and concubines before the eyes like golden fetters.\nHow did Ma Yu awaken from such delusion?\nMeeting Fengxian, he cast off the yoke.\nSeeking leisure within leisure, finding leisure’s delight—\nNow, how could I willingly don those chains again?\n\n**Again**\nI urge you—do not ask of past causes,\nSimply turn back, and it is

      "translated_text": "To enter the Dao without intent requires no distinction,\nTo seek the Mystery with purpose is to have affinity.\nSince ancient times, all immortals have departed the world—\nHow could one find good causes while dwelling at home?\n\n**Again**\nThe Wind Immortal’s wind harms to reveal the true wind,\nLeaving behind a family tradition to harm the wind.\nThe adept Qiu Xian of Tongmi succeeded him,\nWhile Shantong and Ma Yu answered the call of Feng.\n\nI urge you—do not dream within a dream,\nLearn from me to seek the wind within the wind.\nIf asked the cause of wind, I plainly declare:\nCast off the worldly, embrace the wind of the heart.\n\n**For Lord Li of Doumen**\nNo need to seek masters far and wide—\nThe immortal within is your true master.\nTruly pure, truly clear, truly the ultimate principle,\nMost subtle, most wondrous, the truest master.\n\nIf love and hate remain, the Dao is hard to seek;\nWith self and others still present, bowing to masters is in vain.\nIf your will cannot follow mine,\nHow can my heart be your heart’s master?\n\n**Again**\nThe wonders of Qin Chuan are truly extraordinary,\nBest of all is the treasure-hidden land of Zhongnan.\nBamboo paths and plum streams brim with vital essence,\nPhoenix nests and dragon caves exhale auspicious light.\n\nCloud hermitages gather clouds in every place,\nMany Daoist friends discourse on the Dao’s profundity.\nThe name of Liujiang Village has now changed—\nEveryone speaks of the Village of Immortal Meetings.\n\n**Four Poems on the Raft of Immortal Encounter**\n\n**For the Pure Wind Recluse**\nDiligently cultivating beyond the world,\nMeticulously sweeping the heart within.\nGradually severing worldly ties,\nGently penetrating the Mystery’s depths.\n\nThe great elixir forms, numinous and bright,\nThe divine radiance shines, resplendent.\nFortunately meeting the raft of immortals,\nSteadily returning to Penglai Isle.\n\n**Matching the Master’s Rhyme**\nThe Three Lights firmly anchor the Lower Primordial,\nThe Six Perfections purify the Middle Realm.\nThe Nine Cycles’ Upper Primordial lamp\nIllumines the moon of eternal life.\n\nUnceasing brightness, day and night,\nRadiance flows in an unbroken stream.\nRevealing the embryo immortal,\nTranscending life and death this time.\n\n**For Master Yan**\nStill the heart, cut off right and wrong,\nEradicate intent, remove self and others.\nFree from wine, lust, anger, and wealth,\nEscape the wheel of life and death.\n\nAuspicious light weaves precious blossoms,\nMysterious dew forms pearl-like drops.\nNaturally meeting the raft of immortals,\nYou may then ride the clouds.\n\n**Again**\nWith fame achieved, it is good to still the heart,\nWith profit attained, one may turn back.\nMonkey and horse no longer run wild,\nDragon and tiger unite in embrace.\n\nAlways keep the jade gate open,\nNever let the golden pass leak.\nWhen the Nine Cycles’ great elixir is complete,\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, the spirit remains clear and refined.\n\n**Twelve Poems on the Hardship of Family Life**\n\n**For Ning Bogong**\nFamily life is hardship, a pit of fire deep.\nMyriad dusts bury one, unbearable to endure.\nMeeting the Wind Immortal, seeking beyond the world,\nCultivation is good—refining yin and yang.\n\nPure and clear, one sees gold in water,\nRadiant light shines, veiling the precious peak.\n\nFamily life is hardship, constantly busy.\nBusy here, busy there, until impermanence arrives.\nBecoming a yin prisoner, dwelling in the ghostly abode.\n\nCultivation is good, never busy,\nLeisurely guarding the true constant.\nWith completion, the jade cavern awaits.\n\nFamily life is hardship, providing for others.\nClothed and fed, yet still complaining of poverty.\nScheming with cunning, losing one’s true nature.\n\nCultivation is good, living as a leisurely person,\nNaturally caring for the Dao, not for poverty.\nRefining the stubborn heart, nurturing the ultimate truth.\n\nFamily life is hardship, like a bee’s devotion.\nGathering flowers to make honey—for whom is it sweet?\nIf not cautious, caught in the spider’s web.\n\nCultivation is good, becoming a wind devotee.\nThe tongue produces jade-like nectar, sweet as ambrosia,\nNourishing the yellow sprout, free from entanglement.\n\nFamily life is hardship, especially greedy.\nWith wealth abundant, still craving high office.\nFacing danger, no means of escape.\n\nCultivation is good, free from greed.\nHiding one’s light, concealing traces, fearing fame.\nIn non-action, escaping life and death.\n\nFamily life is hardship, clinging to worldly ties.\nPlotting livelihoods, hoping for a thousand years.\nYet this mortal body is not long enduring.\n\nCultivation is good, forming good affinities.\nWith merit complete and conduct fulfilled, no need to count the years.\nBecoming an immortal, for the will is steadfast.\n\nFamily life is hardship, without end or limit.\nOne day, the body dies, becoming a yin prisoner.\nFacing King Yama, no freedom remains.\n\nCultivation is good, with a clear path.\nWith three thousand merits complete, one is no prisoner.\nBecoming an immortal, attaining freedom.\n\nFamily life is hardship, delighting in opposition.\nConstantly pondering the peril of life and death,\nFearing the past, encircled by the fire’s courtyard.\n\nCultivation is good, abiding in non-action.\nThe divine pearl’s radiance pierces the curtains,\nRevealing the spirit child, majestic in appearance.\n\nFamily life is hardship, without respite.\nPerilous and dangerous, like a game of encirclement.\nControlled by others, no prayers avail.\n\nCultivation is good, most rare and wondrous.\nThe maiden and infant vie to ride tiger and dragon,\nOffering the embryo immortal, phoenix and qilin.\n\nFamily life is hardship, for wife and children,\nEnduring right and wrong, glory and disgrace.\nWhen the limit arrives, how can one bear it?\n\nCultivation is good, with a son in the south.\nThe divine elixir shines, abandoning the thatched hut,\nFeasting in the Jasper Pool, virtue fully sated.\n\nCultivation is easy, severing ties is hard.\nAt first, understanding is most difficult.\nLike impermanence, breaking through is arduous.\n\nWith the heart awakened, no doubts remain.\nRealizing the past hardships of family life,\nLearning to be an immortal—what difficulty is there?\n\nPonder the subtle and wondrous, reflect on worldly ties,\nSearching both with precision.\nKnowing emptiness, turn firmly to the Dao.\n\nWith a pure heart and intent penetrating the Mystery,\nNaturally, one understands without words.\nAttaining non-action, becoming a great immortal.\n\n**Two Poems on the Command to Untie the Pendant**\n\n**Matching the Ancient Rhyme**\nShantong awoke sharply,\nFollowing the master’s teachings.\nRealizing the past—all was not, not.\nCorrecting the root source,\nAwaiting sun and moon to arrive together in the pot.\nPenetrating the Mystery Pass, aligning with the principle of the Recluse.\n\nDragon’s roar and whistle, able to move and stop,\nCutting through delusion with the sharp blade of wisdom.\nRefining the divine elixir,\nHeld in a golden plate, offered as a humble gift.\nPresenting it to the Wind Immortal, delighting the original master.\n\n**Again**\nSubduing the strong, tempering the sharp,\nConstantly examining one’s faults.\nAbiding in the true constant, no need for seated meditation.\nBefore others, act small,\nWithout intent to act grand.\nWithin kan and li, tiger sleeps, dragon rests.\n\nNeither hating nor loving, without self or others,\nWhat worry of misfortune or calamity?\nAt ease and carefree,\nSinging in harmony with cloud companions and rosy friends.\nClaiming leisure—how many are there like us?",
