  "full_translation": "**The *Mingzhen Collection* of Master Xuanxu**\n\n**Title:** *Mingzhen Collection of Master Xuanxu*\n**Author:** Master Yuan Xuanxu\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Taiping* Section\n\n**Preface to the *Mingzhen Collection***\n\nThe Dao is fundamentally wordless—yet without words, it cannot be revealed.\nThe Dao is fundamentally without scripture—yet without scripture, it cannot be illuminated.\nTo let the unheard hear, to make the unenlightened awaken.\n\nI first paid homage to Master Xuanchong at the Longxing Abbey in Fenyin. After serving him for over a year, the Master journeyed south to the right of Mianshan, while I relocated north to reside on the sunny side of Gushe. At times, the Master’s coughs and spittle became pearls and jade, composed without leisure for deliberation. Whether meditating on antiquity, borrowing from things, exchanging verses, or giving free rein to inspiration, he followed his heart’s desire. Be it in lyrics or hymns, all clarified the宗旨. They expressed the heart beyond the heart, the words beyond words—each phrase revealing truth, each line flowing toward its source. The prose was concise, its meaning profound.\n\nIt is said in *Mingzhen*:\n*\"On the shadowless tree, flowers laugh at the sun;\nOn the unbudding branch, leaves hold the spring.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"With the horn of a hare, strike open the lock of the Three Poisons;\nWith the fur of a tortoise, sweep away the dust of the Nine Crossroads.\"*\n\nSuch words transcend form and image, distance sound and color. Without the eye of thorough Dharma wisdom and the clarity of thought-free insight, how could one fathom them? Deep as an abyssal spring, vast as the great void—expansive, luminous. They honor the mysterious wind of supreme virtue, exalt the flourishing splendor of eternal spring; they neither deceive the age with cunning nor parade Dao to dazzle the world.\n\nLimpid and resplendent, like a pearl spinning on a golden plate, its pure radiance boundless.\nBrilliant and radiant, like the autumn moon gleaming in the azure sky, its auspicious qi inexhaustible.\n\nThe Master passed away during the Jin Cheng’an era. Later, a gentleman of Fenyin, Master Li, returned from the coastal regions to his hometown. The Master, having heard of him, recognized him as a distinguished disciple of [Master] Changchun. Though he wished to become his student, Li declined and instead paid homage to Changchun. Thus, through reverent inquiry, he gained a fraction of the Master’s secret mysteries, unlocking countless insights.\n\nFortunately, in Puban, there was a fellow Daoist, the aged Wang Juchuan, who sighed in remembrance of the Master’s pearls and jade, praising his extraordinary eloquence in expounding the Dao. His movements were as serene as drifting clouds, his stillness as formless as the valley spirit. He sighed without end.\n\nThen, Master Yang the Recluse and Master Liu, among others, produced the Master’s collection from their sleeves and titled it *Mingzhen Collection*. Fearing its obscurity and dispersal, they ordered its transcription to broaden its transmission. They entreated us to compose a preface, but we were struck with awe and hesitation. How could a vessel as small as a dou or shao contain the hundred rivers? Though repeatedly urged, we persistently declined.\n\nYet, upon perusing it, we found it like fine wine and lamb stew, delighting all palates. The wonders of embodying the Dao, the applications of attaining the Dao—every utterance and phrase may serve as a bridge for others.\n\nFor *mingzhen* means: its resonant sound scatters across the cosmos, unyielding yet ever-emerging, like the Eastern Lord sprouting buds; its true light shines upon heaven and earth, its essence pervading all yet formless, like the ice-wheel mirroring all things. Its brightness equals the blazing sun, its resonance like thunder—such marvels are fully realized.\n\nWritten on the third day after the Double Ninth Festival in the year *xinhai*, by the humble and unworthy Zhang Zhiming, Daoist Registrar of Hezhong Prefecture, Fenyin.\n\n**The *Mingzhen Collection* of Master Xuanxu**\n*Five Poems on the Wisdom Sword*\n\n**Five Poems on the Wisdom Sword**\n\n1.\nFor benefiting all, it severs even a feather’s tip,\nPacifying the realm, aiding the lord to quell fierce tyrants.\nRage births killing qi, constricting heaven and earth;\nWrath stirs battle clouds, towering sky and land.\nThree feet of cold radiance startle ghosts and demons,\nA thousand strands of icy splendor shatter evil spirits.\nA single thunderclap beyond the nine heavens—\nTransforms into a soaring dragon, vanishing without trace.\n\n2.\nNot that yin and yang bear separate edges,\nBut to expel evil and shatter demons, piercing the frigid void.\nWhere the *Dantai* falls, the Seven Stars gleam;\nWhen *Zhou Chu* wields it, ten thousand streams run crimson.\nIts pristine hue transcends yin and yang, beyond grasp,\nIts pure light—heaven and earth cannot contain.\nSince vanquishing *Chiyou* of old,\nIt has secured peace without need for further might.\n\n3.\nDrawn from its scabbard, flawless as finest dust,\nLike *Ji Zha* ascending to heaven, unburdened by mortal ties.\nRather than let *Huang Chao* disrupt the realm,\nIt delights in repaying the Han lord by stabilizing ruler and subject.\nIts three-foot sway stills all nations,\nIts sweeping arc subdues the eight directions, making vassals of all lands.\nWe must thank the *Xuanyuan* legacy passed down—\nThus it aids the sagely lord in purging treacherous ministers.\n\n4.\nThree feet of *Longquan* steel pierces the Dipper and Ox,\nDispelling injustice with each unsheathed stroke.\nIts grinding sharpens killing qi, silencing a thousand demons;\nIts clashing summons storm clouds, vexing a hundred monsters.\nThe snow-bright blade, swift as wind, cools the ninth summer month,\nThe frost-edged tip, like the moon, illuminates the third autumn.\nOnce all peace is settled,\nIt hangs forever in the heavens, never to be sheathed again.\n\n5.\nI have possessed this treasured sword for many years,\nPiercing earth and mountain, attuned to nature’s way.\nAuspicious qi forges it, driving all monsters into hiding,\nIts polished radiance banishes ten thousand evils.\nGlowing brilliance dazzles stars and constellations,\nIts resplendent edge spans earth and sky.\nIdle, it hangs beside the azure heavens’ palace halls—\nNo need to wield it again, companion to the immortals.\n\n---\n\n**Six Poems on Chongpi Valley at Xuandu Abbey**\n\n1.\nChongpi’s ancient traces, a land of flourishing splendor,\nWhere verdant forests and springs conceal the Daoist abode.\nLayered mist unfurls auspicious herbs,\nTiered mountains nurture sacred sprouts.\nDawn’s glow merges with morning’s breath,\nEvening’s fading clouds embrace twilight’s hues.\nTruly a realm of effortless serenity—\nWhere dragons transform in vast seas, frogs never cease.\n\n2.\nA leisurely stroll through Xuandu Abbey—how wondrous!\nLush groves and towering bamboos veil immortal talents.\nMarvelous fruits ripen in season,\nExquisite blossoms bloom each day.\nCranes cry atop pines as clouds drift away,\nTigers roar before cliffs as winds arise.\nWho here grasps this cool purity?\nIn what celestial cavern lies the Jasper Terrace?\n\n3.\nWorldly affairs entangle, leaving no escape,\nYet wandering here, all cares dissolve.\nWinds weave through nine-fold peaks, their beauty refined,\nMists part from three summits, where grasses and trees grow secluded.\nBeyond the gate, clouds veil the woodcutter’s path,\nBefore the hermitage, a stream conceals the immortal’s boat.\nWhen visitors ask of my hidden purpose,\nI point afar to the white snow and laugh without end.\n\n4.\nI am but a recluse in the world’s shadows,\nIdly seeking secluded paths to Xuandu.\nSuddenly, all things fade—no barrier to entry,\nIn an instant, worldly dust is forgotten, unbound.\nMy heart resembles the round autumn moon’s clarity,\nMy nature like drifting wisps of wild clouds.\nLet the seasons hasten—time’s passage swift—\nUnburdened by fame or gain, I remain free.\n\n5.\nBeneath Zhongtiao Mountain, a celestial abode,\nWhere tranquility makes days and months stretch long.\nA thousand peaks, their rocks transformed to jade,\nA hundred grasses, their blooms ever fragrant.\nGuests are served tea steeped in pine-tip snow,\nAt night, the censer burns cypress incense.\nShould anyone come here,\nAll worldly cares vanish at once.\n\n6.\nNorthwest of Zhongtiao lies Xuandu,\nWhere auspicious hues swirl, Daoist qi unfurls.\nAmid emerald bamboos hides the grotto of the Way,\nBeneath verdant pines, the immortal’s gate.\nPeaks stretch endlessly, lush with lingzhi herbs,\nVast pools cradle luminous pearls that banish night.\nHidden from the world’s clamor,\nThis pure seclusion mirrors the isle of Penglai.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems on Bamboo**\n\n1.\nHollow yet solid, a gentleman’s talent,\nNine sheaths nested—how marvelous!\nDefying frost, the phoenix’s fledgling stands proud in the wind,\nScorning snow, the dragon’s heir thrives in the rain.\nDeepest green best suits pines by the railing,\nIts delicate form pairs perfectly with cypress in cultivation.\nAt times, shedding its skin to summon clouds and rain,\nTo witness this, one must ascend beyond the nine heavens.\n\n2.\nFew noble species grace the cold cliffs,\nOnly the finest bamboo endures the years.\nUpright integrity befits a life of simplicity,\nHollow heart aligns with the Dao’s unfolding.\nSoughing in the wind, its chill purity arrives,\nBearing rain, its cleansing beauty shines.\nWho else embodies the eternal, a gentleman’s vessel?\nIt alone suits the immortal’s cave and the Daoist’s home.\n\n---\n\n**Three Poems Expressing My Aspirations**\n\n1.\nUnwavering resolve leads straight home,\nRevealing mist and rosy clouds everywhere.\nCaressing stars and constellations—no need for words,\nDriving winds and clouds—no cause for boasting.\nWhen nature settles, the five aggregates dissolve,\nWhen life arises, what need for the three vehicles?\nEvery person possesses the scenery of Caoxi,\nThe Penglai isle lies but a hand’s reach away.\n\n2.\nTrue leisure, true joy—called *Xuanchong*,\nSeventy years of nurturing idleness.\nEverywhere, forests and springs offer new livelihoods,\nIn every household, clouds and waters carry old traditions.\nA thousand scriptures traversed, all knowledge forgotten,\nTen thousand dharmas explored, yet inexhaustible.\nI tell my disciples of this message:\nThe moon sets in the west as waters flow east.\n\n3.\nA Daoist’s livelihood holds no cares,\nThe moon of nature shines freely.\nCultivating simplicity needs no external search,\nRefining truth requires no inner striving.\nThe luminous pearl radiates through heaven and earth,\nThe pristine moon gleams upon the Dipper and Ox.\nThe wondrous Dao has ever been pure,\nIn the Celestial Capital, I roam at ease.\n\n---\n\n**On the Deep Stream of Chongpi Valley**\n\nNorth of *Tiaoyang*, a stream flows,\nIrrigating three fields where crops grow secluded.\nIts sound, like wind through emerald mountains,\nIts qi, merging with daylight, floats upon the waters.\nA thousand waves churn from the pearl’s cavern,\nTen thousand currents hasten the fisherman’s boat.\nHow laughable—*Xu You* washing his ears!\nFar better to emerge from the waves, heart gladdened.\n\n---\n\n**Three Poems Admonishing the World**\n\n1.\nWorldly affairs rush by, day after day,\nOblivious to the wellspring of spirit, never pausing to reflect.\nIn the arena of gain and loss, tongues brandish swords,\nAmid the waves of right and wrong, lips clash like spears.\n\n**On the Fleeting World**\n\nIn the mortal realm, time rushes by in haste,\nBeyond the world, spring days stretch long and vast.\nThis fleeting glory—how can it compare?\nWho knows the sands of samsara teem with immortal lands?\n\nAlas! Worldly affairs bring ceaseless toil,\nVying for breath, craving wealth, all turns to spoil.\nA thousand snares entangle, no escape in sight,\nTen thousand bonds obstruct the Way’s pure light.\nTurn your head, break free from the chains of right and wrong,\nTrust your steps, trample the field of fame and gain to song.\nBetter to retreat where emerald cliffs embrace the stream,\nAt ease, nurture simplicity, preserve your primal yang’s gleam.\n\nI urge you: shun the arena of strife,\nWhere schemes and sorrows weave a tangled life.\nHow can you grasp at fame, a candle in the wind?\nOr cling to love, a lightning’s fleeting glint?\nTo chase renown is not to chase the Daoist’s way,\nTo seek wealth pales beside the quest for truth’s array.\nIf you would leap beyond the world’s entangling net,\nReturn early to the cliffs and burn your heart’s incense yet.\n\n**To Master Zhang of Fenyin**\n\nI bow to you, my kindred spirit, Zhang the Daoist true,\nSince parting, have you thrived in truth’s unchanging hue?\nNo wild geese bring word from Penglai’s isle,\nNo cranes convey the spring of Lang Garden’s smile.\nIn the Daoist abbey, wind alone keeps you company,\nIn the silent meditation hall, bamboo stands nearby.\nDo not forget our verse-bound vow, my friend,\nTo share the moon’s pure light o’er towers that ascend.\n\n**Three Laments for Horse Ma**\n\nAlas! Noble steed, how grievous your fate,\nFor ten years you bore me, now your life abates.\nYour spirit drifts away from this mortal plane,\nThree souls wander, leaving no trace again.\nYour saddle and bridle hang idle, my strength undone,\nNo whip nor rein stirred—yet your service was done.\nTo shed your form and return to the source is best,\nWith spring’s thunder, ascend as a dragon in flight’s crest.\n\nMournful! Peerless courser, swift and bright,\nI yearned for you endlessly, day and night.\nDaily you roamed the vast desert sands,\nEver responding to the land’s commands.\nFor years you spread virtue with boundless might,\nToday you part, your debt repaid in full light.\nMay your true spirit transcend the world’s chain,\nPlunge into the vast sea, reborn as dragon again.\n\nAlas! My swift steed, how I mourn your flight,\nYou traversed mountains and rivers, near and far in sight.\nNow you depart before me, your task complete,\nWhile I remain, my journey incomplete.\nFor years you bore me like a soaring phoenix grand,\nToday you fade, transformed to a dragon’s band.\nGently you rise to the purple courts above,\nAt peace, your steps now join the immortals’ love.\n\n**Nurturing Simplicity in Tranquility**\n\nThe Daoist’s livelihood knows no pride nor excess,\nIn quiet emptiness, the years softly pass.\nSilent, he nurtures spirit—what need for wine?\nDrowsy, he guards life—no tea can refine.\nAt peace, he cultivates simplicity, pure and true,\nVigilant in virtue, idle, yet ever new.\nRefining the priceless treasure of primordial dawn,\nHe rides the simurgh, vanishing to the immortal throng.\n\n**Two Poems on Serene Detachment**\n\nEver have I scorned the furrowed brow,\nMy nature at ease—what cause for sorrow?\nThe bright moon illumines, all karma fades,\nThe clear wind brushes past, ten thousand ties unmade.\nLet the world’s waves roll on beyond the street,\nLet storms rage outside—here, all flows sweet.\nI’ve learned the art of idleness, carefree as can be,\nLost in blissful sleep, snoring with glee.\n\nNo entanglements, no strife—what more to seek?\nUnfettered, all things cease, my spirit sleek.\nWorldly manners swirl, yet never cling,\nWorldly affairs rush by, leaving no sting.\nThe luminous pearl of spirit—how could it be marred?\nThe moon of nature—how could it be scarred?\nNo need to exhaust your steps in Lang Garden’s quest,\nAwakened, you turn and arrive at Penglai’s rest.\n\n**Two Poems on the Preciousness of Naturalness**\n\nA spark of numinous clarity—nature’s own art,\nWhy labor to seek immortals with weary heart?\nAfter rain, the jewel-mountain’s stones gleam like jade,\nIn the Dharma sea, clouds part, fire blooms a lotus’ blade.\nAwakened, you hear not the lion’s roar,\nEnlightened, you cast off the fox’s deluded lore.\nEmbrace the Supreme’s profound, mysterious play,\nLeap beyond yin and yang, beyond the Emperor’s sway.\n\nCultivating truth requires no strenuous toil,\nCease your futile efforts, foolish disciple’s coil.\nTo shake marrow and sinew—all is but vain,\nTo swallow saliva, absorb fluids—how misguided the strain.\nThe elixir of spirit needs no varied craft,\nTrue qi is bound by no single path or draft.\nHow laughable—those who seek without,\nWhen the immortal’s road lies within, close about.\n\n**Two Poems on Finding Joy in Idleness**\n\nIn idleness, joy arises, no need for hermit’s cell,\nWhy dwell in cloud-capped peaks or valleys fell?\nSilent, I set aside the Three Teachings’ tome,\nDrowsy, I leave the Five Carts’ scrolls alone.\nMy household’s ways are sparse, yet nothing’s lacking,\nMy livelihood is pure, with naught in lacking.\nNot in Lu’s capital, sitting idle in vain,\nThe mirror of the Dao reflects the round and plain.\n\nDeep in the valley’s seclusion, I build my thatched retreat,\nFar from the bustling markets, my dwelling sweet.\nIn the Palace of Everlasting Night, a guest at ease,\nIn the Hall of Perpetual Light, no scholar’s chains to please.\nThe Dharma sea’s waves settle, still and clear,\nThe spirit pool’s depths lie empty, without fear.\nThe elusive fish grasps the pearl—no need to strive,\nNo labor of thought to dream in Hua Xu’s hive.\n\n**To Daoist Li Zhiyu**\n\nTruly at ease is Daoist Li,\nFrom the first, a speck of dust defies his eye.\nWisdom shines, precepts firm—words fail to tell,\nAwareness of non-action speaks but seldom.\nThe blessed lands and forests are his friends,\nThe grotto heavens and flowing clouds his kin.\nTurning his light within, he grasps eternal spring’s delight,\nLeaping beyond yin and yang, beyond the kalpas’ blight.\n\n**To Daoist Wu the Judge**\n\nThis old man, too lazy to grasp brush and ink,\nStartled to find his temples touched by frost’s link.\nBefore my eyes, familiar scenes—time flies swift,\nBeyond the world, my household’s ways—long days drift.\nI strive to learn Chen Tuan’s threefold sleep,\nNo need to echo Du Fu’s ninefold grief.\nContent, I’ll be an idle, carefree sage,\nShedding worldly toil—what harm in age?\n\n**Two Poems Expressing My Feelings**\n\nLeaning on my staff, I wander from my thatched abode,\nGaze afar o’er fields—no brocade could match this road.\nGeese depart Hengyang, the sky pale and wide,\nSwallows leave the sea peaks, rain scatters the tide.\nA river of beauty—peach blossoms unfold,\nThe earth awash in spring—willows unroll.\nAt dusk I return, with naught to do,\nNurturing spirit and simplicity, joy ever true.\n\nAll things forgotten, I never leave my hut,\nHiding my traces, unbound, my form at ease.\nWorldly gains and losses—all fade away,\nBefore my eyes, floating glory—each thing grows distant, gray.\nWhen inspired, I sit cross-legged on my rush mat,\nWhen weary, I stretch on my earthen bed flat.\nNow I’ve become a carefree, idle old man,\nJoyful and free, the Dao’s essence my plan.\n\n**Inscribed at Xuantong Abbey in Wanggu Valley**\n\nWanggu’s legacy holds a starry altar’s trace,\nXuantong Abbey—where immortals dwell in grace.\nMountains lush, clouds veil bamboo where phoenixes alight,\nEarth abundant, mists shroud springs where dragons take flight.\n\nA single peak holds imperial deeds of a thousand years,\nThree imperial summons to the immortal’s pavilion—eternal fame.\nThe Transcendent Emperor eludes all mortal sight,\nYet his pure name, undying, resounds through past and present.\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrain**\n*Awakening the Mind*\n\nTo set the heart on truth is easy—long endurance hard,\nUnwavering as Mount Tai, steadfast in resolve.\nSever the bonds of love, let dust not cling,\nAnd naturally, with ease, attain serene repose.\n\n**In Reply to Master Wang’s Inquiry: Where Lies the Dao?**\n\nForget transgressions, quell desires, and steel the heart,\nThe Dao abides in emptiness—where to seek its trace?\nRecognize your original, true visage,\nAnd in the act of taking up and laying down, find a kindred soul.\n\n**For Master Zhang, Who Fails to Awaken**\n\nBreak the locks of care, draw forth the self,\nSever the snares of fame—then rest is found.\nIf your nature is like the azure sky, clouds drifting free,\nAll entanglements dissolve, and the heart rejoices unbound.\n\n**For Daoist Li**\n\nLi the Daoist, free of thought, embraces non-action,\nTo set all things aside—this is perfection’s way.\nHaving attained the joy of eternal life,\nHe leaps beyond the springs of yin and yang, beyond the kalpas’ sway.\n\n**Ode to Tea**\n\nThe Golden Lad plucks leaves of magic lingzhi,\nThe Jade Maiden gathers sprouts from Penglai’s garden fair.\nShould one know this flavor’s worth,\nIts pure fragrance surpasses Zhao Zhou’s tea beyond compare.\n\n**The Divine Pearl**\n\nRound and formless, without trace or track,\nTen thousand rays of rosy light pierce the azure sky.\nIlluminating the great chiliocosm, embracing the Dharma realm,\nHow could heaven and earth ever hope to confine it nigh?\n\n**Chan and the Dao**\n\nChan is the Dao, the Dao is Chan—non-action their way,\nDao and Chan are not two, no bias, no decay.\nOriginally one point, without distinction’s art,\nLimpid and clear, it ever manifests before the heart.\n\n**Sitting in Purity**\n\nLimpid and still, in the quiet chamber’s space,\nGather the spirit in silent nurture of form.\nSoul at peace, spirit purified, host and guest unite,\nAll thoughts forgotten—nothing remains, no single trace.\n\n**The Authentic Collection of Xuanyuzi Concludes**",

      "translated_text": "**Five Poems on the Wisdom Sword**\n\n1.\nFor benefiting all, it severs even a feather’s tip,\nPacifying the realm, aiding the lord to quell fierce tyrants.\nRage births killing qi, constricting heaven and earth;\nWrath stirs battle clouds, towering sky and land.\nThree feet of cold radiance startle ghosts and demons,\nA thousand strands of icy splendor shatter evil spirits.\nA single thunderclap beyond the nine heavens—\nTransforms into a soaring dragon, vanishing without trace.\n\n2.\nNot that yin and yang bear separate edges,\nBut to expel evil and shatter demons, piercing the frigid void.\nWhere the *Dantai* falls, the Seven Stars gleam;\nWhen *Zhou Chu* wields it, ten thousand streams run crimson.\nIts pristine hue transcends yin and yang, beyond grasp,\nIts pure light—heaven and earth cannot contain.\nSince vanquishing *Chiyou* of old,\nIt has secured peace without need for further might.\n\n3.\nDrawn from its scabbard, flawless as finest dust,\nLike *Ji Zha* ascending to heaven, unburdened by mortal ties.\nRather than let *Huang Chao* disrupt the realm,\nIt delights in repaying the Han lord by stabilizing ruler and subject.\nIts three-foot sway stills all nations,\nIts sweeping arc subdues the eight directions, making vassals of all lands.\nWe must thank the *Xuanyuan* legacy passed down—\nThus it aids the sagely lord in purging treacherous ministers.\n\n4.\nThree feet of *Longquan* steel pierces the Dipper and Ox,\nDispelling injustice with each unsheathed stroke.\nIts grinding sharpens killing qi, silencing a thousand demons;\nIts clashing summons storm clouds, vexing a hundred monsters.\nThe snow-bright blade, swift as wind, cools the ninth summer month,\nThe frost-edged tip, like the moon, illuminates the third autumn.\nOnce all peace is settled,\nIt hangs forever in the heavens, never to be sheathed again.\n\n5.\nI have possessed this treasured sword for many years,\nPiercing earth and mountain, attuned to nature’s way.\nAuspicious qi forges it, driving all monsters into hiding,\nIts polished radiance banishes ten thousand evils.\nGlowing brilliance dazzles stars and constellations,\nIts resplendent edge spans earth and sky.\nIdle, it hangs beside the azure heavens’ palace halls—\nNo need to wield it again, companion to the immortals.\n\n---\n\n**Six Poems on Chongpi Valley at Xuandu Abbey**\n\n1.\nChongpi’s ancient traces, a land of flourishing splendor,\nWhere verdant forests and springs conceal the Daoist abode.\nLayered mist unfurls auspicious herbs,\nTiered mountains nurture sacred sprouts.\nDawn’s glow merges with morning’s breath,\nEvening’s fading clouds embrace twilight’s hues.\nTruly a realm of effortless serenity—\nWhere dragons transform in vast seas, frogs never cease.\n\n2.\nA leisurely stroll through Xuandu Abbey—how wondrous!\nLush groves and towering bamboos veil immortal talents.\nMarvelous fruits ripen in season,\nExquisite blossoms bloom each day.\nCranes cry atop pines as clouds drift away,\nTigers roar before cliffs as winds arise.\nWho here grasps this cool purity?\nIn what celestial cavern lies the Jasper Terrace?\n\n3.\nWorldly affairs entangle, leaving no escape,\nYet wandering here, all cares dissolve.\nWinds weave through nine-fold peaks, their beauty refined,\nMists part from three summits, where grasses and trees grow secluded.\nBeyond the gate, clouds veil the woodcutter’s path,\nBefore the hermitage, a stream conceals the immortal’s boat.\nWhen visitors ask of my hidden purpose,\nI point afar to the white snow and laugh without end.\n\n4.\nI am but a recluse in the world’s shadows,\nIdly seeking secluded paths to Xuandu.\nSuddenly, all things fade—no barrier to entry,\nIn an instant, worldly dust is forgotten, unbound.\nMy heart resembles the round autumn moon’s clarity,\nMy nature like drifting wisps of wild clouds.\nLet the seasons hasten—time’s passage swift—\nUnburdened by fame or gain, I remain free.\n\n5.\nBeneath Zhongtiao Mountain, a celestial abode,\nWhere tranquility makes days and months stretch long.\nA thousand peaks, their rocks transformed to jade,\nA hundred grasses, their blooms ever fragrant.\nGuests are served tea steeped in pine-tip snow,\nAt night, the censer burns cypress incense.\nShould anyone come here,\nAll worldly cares vanish at once.\n\n6.\nNorthwest of Zhongtiao lies Xuandu,\nWhere auspicious hues swirl, Daoist qi unfurls.\nAmid emerald bamboos hides the grotto of the Way,\nBeneath verdant pines, the immortal’s gate.\nPeaks stretch endlessly, lush with lingzhi herbs,\nVast pools cradle luminous pearls that banish night.\nHidden from the world’s clamor,\nThis pure seclusion mirrors the isle of Penglai.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems on Bamboo**\n\n1.\nHollow yet solid, a gentleman’s talent,\nNine sheaths nested—how marvelous!\nDefying frost, the phoenix’s fledgling stands proud in the wind,\nScorning snow, the dragon’s heir thrives in the rain.\nDeepest green best suits pines by the railing,\nIts delicate form pairs perfectly with cypress in cultivation.\nAt times, shedding its skin to summon clouds and rain,\nTo witness this, one must ascend beyond the nine heavens.\n\n2.\nFew noble species grace the cold cliffs,\nOnly the finest bamboo endures the years.\nUpright integrity befits a life of simplicity,\nHollow heart aligns with the Dao’s unfolding.\nSoughing in the wind, its chill purity arrives,\nBearing rain, its cleansing beauty shines.\nWho else embodies the eternal, a gentleman’s vessel?\nIt alone suits the immortal’s cave and the Daoist’s home.\n\n---\n\n**Three Poems Expressing My Aspirations**\n\n1.\nUnwavering resolve leads straight home,\nRevealing mist and rosy clouds everywhere.\nCaressing stars and constellations—no need for words,\nDriving winds and clouds—no cause for boasting.\nWhen nature settles, the five aggregates dissolve,\nWhen life arises, what need for the three vehicles?\nEvery person possesses the scenery of Caoxi,\nThe Penglai isle lies but a hand’s reach away.\n\n2.\nTrue leisure, true joy—called *Xuanchong*,\nSeventy years of nurturing idleness.\nEverywhere, forests and springs offer new livelihoods,\nIn every household, clouds and waters carry old traditions.\nA thousand scriptures traversed, all knowledge forgotten,\nTen thousand dharmas explored, yet inexhaustible.\nI tell my disciples of this message:\nThe moon sets in the west as waters flow east.\n\n3.\nA Daoist’s livelihood holds no cares,\nThe moon of nature shines freely.\nCultivating simplicity needs no external search,\nRefining truth requires no inner striving.\nThe luminous pearl radiates through heaven and earth,\nThe pristine moon gleams upon the Dipper and Ox.\nThe wondrous Dao has ever been pure,\nIn the Celestial Capital, I roam at ease.\n\n---\n\n**On the Deep Stream of Chongpi Valley**\n\nNorth of *Tiaoyang*, a stream flows,\nIrrigating three fields where crops grow secluded.\nIts sound, like wind through emerald mountains,\nIts qi, merging with daylight, floats upon the waters.\nA thousand waves churn from the pearl’s cavern,\nTen thousand currents hasten the fisherman’s boat.\nHow laughable—*Xu You* washing his ears!\nFar better to emerge from the waves, heart gladdened.\n\n---\n\n**Three Poems Admonishing the World**\n\n1.\nWorldly affairs rush by, day after day,\nOblivious to the wellspring of spirit, never pausing to reflect.\nIn the arena of gain and loss, tongues brandish swords,\nAmid the waves of right and wrong, lips clash like spears.",

      "translated_text": "**On the Fleeting World**\n\nIn the mortal realm, time rushes by in haste,\nBeyond the world, spring days stretch long and vast.\nThis fleeting glory—how can it compare?\nWho knows the sands of samsara teem with immortal lands?\n\nAlas! Worldly affairs bring ceaseless toil,\nVying for breath, craving wealth, all turns to spoil.\nA thousand snares entangle, no escape in sight,\nTen thousand bonds obstruct the Way’s pure light.\nTurn your head, break free from the chains of right and wrong,\nTrust your steps, trample the field of fame and gain to song.\nBetter to retreat where emerald cliffs embrace the stream,\nAt ease, nurture simplicity, preserve your primal yang’s gleam.\n\nI urge you: shun the arena of strife,\nWhere schemes and sorrows weave a tangled life.\nHow can you grasp at fame, a candle in the wind?\nOr cling to love, a lightning’s fleeting glint?\nTo chase renown is not to chase the Daoist’s way,\nTo seek wealth pales beside the quest for truth’s array.\nIf you would leap beyond the world’s entangling net,\nReturn early to the cliffs and burn your heart’s incense yet.\n\n**To Master Zhang of Fenyin**\n\nI bow to you, my kindred spirit, Zhang the Daoist true,\nSince parting, have you thrived in truth’s unchanging hue?\nNo wild geese bring word from Penglai’s isle,\nNo cranes convey the spring of Lang Garden’s smile.\nIn the Daoist abbey, wind alone keeps you company,\nIn the silent meditation hall, bamboo stands nearby.\nDo not forget our verse-bound vow, my friend,\nTo share the moon’s pure light o’er towers that ascend.\n\n**Three Laments for Horse Ma**\n\nAlas! Noble steed, how grievous your fate,\nFor ten years you bore me, now your life abates.\nYour spirit drifts away from this mortal plane,\nThree souls wander, leaving no trace again.\nYour saddle and bridle hang idle, my strength undone,\nNo whip nor rein stirred—yet your service was done.\nTo shed your form and return to the source is best,\nWith spring’s thunder, ascend as a dragon in flight’s crest.\n\nMournful! Peerless courser, swift and bright,\nI yearned for you endlessly, day and night.\nDaily you roamed the vast desert sands,\nEver responding to the land’s commands.\nFor years you spread virtue with boundless might,\nToday you part, your debt repaid in full light.\nMay your true spirit transcend the world’s chain,\nPlunge into the vast sea, reborn as dragon again.\n\nAlas! My swift steed, how I mourn your flight,\nYou traversed mountains and rivers, near and far in sight.\nNow you depart before me, your task complete,\nWhile I remain, my journey incomplete.\nFor years you bore me like a soaring phoenix grand,\nToday you fade, transformed to a dragon’s band.\nGently you rise to the purple courts above,\nAt peace, your steps now join the immortals’ love.\n\n**Nurturing Simplicity in Tranquility**\n\nThe Daoist’s livelihood knows no pride nor excess,\nIn quiet emptiness, the years softly pass.\nSilent, he nurtures spirit—what need for wine?\nDrowsy, he guards life—no tea can refine.\nAt peace, he cultivates simplicity, pure and true,\nVigilant in virtue, idle, yet ever new.\nRefining the priceless treasure of primordial dawn,\nHe rides the simurgh, vanishing to the immortal throng.\n\n**Two Poems on Serene Detachment**\n\nEver have I scorned the furrowed brow,\nMy nature at ease—what cause for sorrow?\nThe bright moon illumines, all karma fades,\nThe clear wind brushes past, ten thousand ties unmade.\nLet the world’s waves roll on beyond the street,\nLet storms rage outside—here, all flows sweet.\nI’ve learned the art of idleness, carefree as can be,\nLost in blissful sleep, snoring with glee.\n\nNo entanglements, no strife—what more to seek?\nUnfettered, all things cease, my spirit sleek.\nWorldly manners swirl, yet never cling,\nWorldly affairs rush by, leaving no sting.\nThe luminous pearl of spirit—how could it be marred?\nThe moon of nature—how could it be scarred?\nNo need to exhaust your steps in Lang Garden’s quest,\nAwakened, you turn and arrive at Penglai’s rest.\n\n**Two Poems on the Preciousness of Naturalness**\n\nA spark of numinous clarity—nature’s own art,\nWhy labor to seek immortals with weary heart?\nAfter rain, the jewel-mountain’s stones gleam like jade,\nIn the Dharma sea, clouds part, fire blooms a lotus’ blade.\nAwakened, you hear not the lion’s roar,\nEnlightened, you cast off the fox’s deluded lore.\nEmbrace the Supreme’s profound, mysterious play,\nLeap beyond yin and yang, beyond the Emperor’s sway.\n\nCultivating truth requires no strenuous toil,\nCease your futile efforts, foolish disciple’s coil.\nTo shake marrow and sinew—all is but vain,\nTo swallow saliva, absorb fluids—how misguided the strain.\nThe elixir of spirit needs no varied craft,\nTrue qi is bound by no single path or draft.\nHow laughable—those who seek without,\nWhen the immortal’s road lies within, close about.\n\n**Two Poems on Finding Joy in Idleness**\n\nIn idleness, joy arises, no need for hermit’s cell,\nWhy dwell in cloud-capped peaks or valleys fell?\nSilent, I set aside the Three Teachings’ tome,\nDrowsy, I leave the Five Carts’ scrolls alone.\nMy household’s ways are sparse, yet nothing’s lacking,\nMy livelihood is pure, with naught in lacking.\nNot in Lu’s capital, sitting idle in vain,\nThe mirror of the Dao reflects the round and plain.\n\nDeep in the valley’s seclusion, I build my thatched retreat,\nFar from the bustling markets, my dwelling sweet.\nIn the Palace of Everlasting Night, a guest at ease,\nIn the Hall of Perpetual Light, no scholar’s chains to please.\nThe Dharma sea’s waves settle, still and clear,\nThe spirit pool’s depths lie empty, without fear.\nThe elusive fish grasps the pearl—no need to strive,\nNo labor of thought to dream in Hua Xu’s hive.\n\n**To Daoist Li Zhiyu**\n\nTruly at ease is Daoist Li,\nFrom the first, a speck of dust defies his eye.\nWisdom shines, precepts firm—words fail to tell,\nAwareness of non-action speaks but seldom.\nThe blessed lands and forests are his friends,\nThe grotto heavens and flowing clouds his kin.\nTurning his light within, he grasps eternal spring’s delight,\nLeaping beyond yin and yang, beyond the kalpas’ blight.\n\n**To Daoist Wu the Judge**\n\nThis old man, too lazy to grasp brush and ink,\nStartled to find his temples touched by frost’s link.\nBefore my eyes, familiar scenes—time flies swift,\nBeyond the world, my household’s ways—long days drift.\nI strive to learn Chen Tuan’s threefold sleep,\nNo need to echo Du Fu’s ninefold grief.\nContent, I’ll be an idle, carefree sage,\nShedding worldly toil—what harm in age?\n\n**Two Poems Expressing My Feelings**\n\nLeaning on my staff, I wander from my thatched abode,\nGaze afar o’er fields—no brocade could match this road.\nGeese depart Hengyang, the sky pale and wide,\nSwallows leave the sea peaks, rain scatters the tide.\nA river of beauty—peach blossoms unfold,\nThe earth awash in spring—willows unroll.\nAt dusk I return, with naught to do,\nNurturing spirit and simplicity, joy ever true.\n\nAll things forgotten, I never leave my hut,\nHiding my traces, unbound, my form at ease.\nWorldly gains and losses—all fade away,\nBefore my eyes, floating glory—each thing grows distant, gray.\nWhen inspired, I sit cross-legged on my rush mat,\nWhen weary, I stretch on my earthen bed flat.\nNow I’ve become a carefree, idle old man,\nJoyful and free, the Dao’s essence my plan.\n\n**Inscribed at Xuantong Abbey in Wanggu Valley**\n\nWanggu’s legacy holds a starry altar’s trace,\nXuantong Abbey—where immortals dwell in grace.\nMountains lush, clouds veil bamboo where phoenixes alight,\nEarth abundant, mists shroud springs where dragons take flight.",
