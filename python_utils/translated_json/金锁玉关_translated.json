  "full_translation": "The **Fengshui Classics** (《风水经》):\n\n---\n**First Section (金锁玉关):**\n\nThe golden locks and jade barriers stand firm,\nWhere mixed porridge first opens the Five Directions.\nThe Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon align the Three Principles.\n\nThe Great Cycle’s square array scatters stars and constellations,\nThe clarity of Heaven and the turbidity of Earth harmonize Yin and Yang.\nWinds, rains, thunders, and lights all arise from the **qi** of the mountains.\nLofty ridges and broad waters hold auspicious designs.\n\nHeaven’s **Dao** and Earth’s foundation distinguish high and low,\nArranged in order, they receive the constant nurturing.\nPaired in Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, male and female form perfect duality.\n\nThe Four Seasons and Eight Festivals divide day and night,\nThe Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams connect with the **Tian Gang** (天罡).\nThe Five Phases inverted, pushing through a thousand revolutions—\nMetal, wood, water, fire, earth at the center.\n\nThe **One Hundred Twenty Divine Deities and Killing Stars**,\nThe **Ninety-Four Positions of Auspicious and Inauspicious Generals**,\nSome govern years, others months for prosperity,\nSome govern days, others times for fortune’s favor.\n\nWhen **Qian Mountain** (乾山) is high and **Gen Water** (艮水) thrives, the people flourish.\nWhen **Xun’s** (巽) upper reaches are full, great joy and auspiciousness prevail.\nWhen **Li’s** (离) upper reaches welcome the **Dragon**, it blesses the tomb’s location,\nAnd descendants through generations produce scholars.\n\nThe fields and villages teem with people year by year,\nPurple robes and golden belts adorn the morning rituals.\nThe winding paths before the gate curve and bend,\nBringing eternal honor and distant prosperity.\n\nOn the northwest roads, the **qi** is bold and swelling,\nThis place is called the **Auspicious Village** (吉庄).\nEach household prospers, rich in wealth and grandeur,\nAll four directions balanced—this is the Heavenly Realm.\n\nIf the front is high and the rear is low, it cannot endure,\nIf the rear is high and the front is low, the fields are vast.\nIf east is low and west is high, it’s called **Inverted Earth** (逆地),\nAnd water flows disrupting the **Zhen Palace** (震宫), not harmonizing.\n\nThough the water flows away without obstruction,\nIt also causes the people to scatter far.\nIf east is high and west is low, it’s the **Ze Domain** (泽地),\nAnd it’s decreed that future generations will produce virtuous and capable descendants.\n\nIf the **qi** flows strongly yet remains still, it brings wealth and honor,\nAnd future generations will become pillars of the state.\nIf there’s a pond behind the dwelling, it brings poverty and depletion,\nAnd also causes childlessness, hollow stomachs, and intestinal ailments.\n\nIf the front is directly struck by water, the **Five Arrows** (五箭) are harmed,\nAnd it’s decreed that tuberculosis and disasters will befall.\nIf the water surges past two positions above,\nDescendants will be licentious and lack authority.\n\nThough the water flows away without obstruction,\nThe pond behind the dwelling gradually decays.\nIf **Xun’s** (巽) upper reaches take water, it cannot last long,\nAnd though wealth and honor may come, it’s not truly auspicious.\n\nIf the rear of the hall is a foul land, it’s called the **Cutting Domain** (绝地),\nAnd the **Two Arrows of the Northeast** (东北两箭) are hardest to defend against.\nThough wealth and honor may come, they won’t endure long,\nAnd after fifteen years, misfortune will surely arrive.\n\nIf the rear is high and the front is low, it’s the highest auspice.\nIn the **Renzi Year** (壬子), the **Dragon** and **Tiger** ascend, cattle and sheep thrive.\nGranaries and treasure houses flourish abundantly,\nAnd wealth, honor, and auspiciousness prevail.\n\nIf there are hills behind and foul lands before,\nWinding paths that flow into the **Long River** (长江),\nWealth accumulates, people and livestock prosper,\nAnd descendants through generations enjoy longevity and fortune.\n\nIf the four sides are low and the center is high,\nWater flows outward like a blade of slaughter.\nThough the four directions may form **Dragon** and **Tiger** (龙虎),\nAfter twenty-four years, the family will suffer dispersal.\n\nIf there are stones before the gate, dust will scatter,\nBandits and thieves will bring calamity.\nEndless lawsuits and quarrels will plague the year,\nAnd the **Divine Arrows** (神箭) cannot ward off hidden strikes.\n\nIf the four sides are high and the center is low,\nThis place is called the **Hell Pond** (地狱池).\nThe household declines, unable to prosper.\nYin dominates, Yang decays, and affairs grow impoverished.\n\nIf the front is narrow and the rear is wide, it’s prosperous beyond measure,\nThe family thrives, wealth is certain.\nDescendants flourish, officials visit often,\nFields and gardens are abundant, filled with mulberry and hemp.\n\nIf the front is wide and the rear is narrow, it’s needless to say,\nThe family will be destitute, selling off all its lands.\nDescendants flee to distant places,\nOnly because the gate’s mouth is too broad, inviting **Killing Fists** (凶拳).\n\nIf the winds and thunders are high and the **Tianze** (天泽) is low,\nThere’s ample grain and sufficient harvest for prosperity.\nOutbound carriages and horses follow in abundance,\nAnd descendants through generations serve in officialdom.\n\nIf the left extends and the right contracts, it’s the most auspicious,\nWhen **Gen’s** (艮) upper reaches welcome the **Dragon**, people and wealth flourish.\n**Yingxing** (鹰行) and **Renyi** (人仪) bring harmony to the household,\nAnd descendants through generations wear purple robes.\n\nPigs, sheep, cattle, and horses gather in groups,\nForty years later, their prosperity will rise.\nIf **Zi** (子) and **Wu** (午) are both full, it brings broad fortune,\nAnd year after year, blessings and wealth will be drawn in.\n\nWhen encountering officials, joy and transformation bring auspice,\nA lifetime of robes and blessings, smiling faces open wide.\nThough wealth and honor may come, fields and properties flourish,\nDescendants will never be stripped of their prosperity.\n\nIf **Xuanwu** (玄武) is high and **Zhuqiao** (朱雀) is low,\nBefore the gate lie several **Nine-Dragon Lands** (九龙地).\nThe **Green Dragon** (青龙) comes from the east, the **White Tiger** (白虎) from the west,\nAnd longevity and fortune are complete, receiving **Guo Bei** (孤悖) blessings.\n\nIf water flows from both sides, striking the center,\nThe front is high and the rear is low—misfortune is certain.\nPeople and wealth scatter, inviting official troubles,\nAnd boldness leads to theft, while women act wantonly.\n\nIf water flows to and from a solitary village,\nIts mysteries are hard to discern.\n\n**Second Section (金锁玉关):**\n\nThe world’s people do not recognize its subtleties—\nMountains bring prosperity, waters bring wealth and fortune.\n\nThe **Three Mountains** (三山) and **Xuanwu** (玄武) rise with bold **qi**,\nWater flowing eastward returns to the hall like waves.\nThe paths surge through the **Kun Way** (坤道), connecting comings and goings,\nNot becoming nobles, but becoming pillars of the state.\n\nIf water flows away and mountains come, longevity and fortune are complete,\nAnd descendants wear golden belts, producing virtuous and beautiful offspring.\nIf the **Coming Dragon** (来龙) is properly aligned above the tomb,\nEach generation’s descendants will become leaders and scholars.\n\nIf **Chen** (辰) and **Mao** (卯) bring the **Green Dragon** (青龙) from the east,\nAnd **Shen** (申) and **Wei** (酉) welcome the **White Tiger** (白虎) from the west,\n**Bing** (丙) and **Ding** (丁) curve the waters toward the **Morning Court** (朝拱),\nAnd descendants wear green robes, bowing in the **Dan Palace** (丹墀).\n\nIf the **Xiu** (酉) position is high and the **Gao** (岗) is low,\nAnd the **Mao** (卯) position is low and the **Wu** (午) side is broad,\nMen and women within will be licentious, lacking high and low distinctions.\nWidows in the inner chambers endure loneliness and sorrow.\n\nIf the land is broad and the four sides are level,\nA dwelling may be established without concern for **qi** alignment.\nIt doesn’t matter if mountains come or waters flow,\nThe family will prosper, all affairs flourishing.\n\nIf there are trenches and rivers behind the dwelling, avoid them,\nFor descendants will scatter east and west.\n**Yin People** (阴人) with evil eyes will come to harm them,\nAnd they will suffer hunger, cold, and loneliness.\n\nIf the grass is lush and vibrant, the colors are fine,\nAnd the dwelling stands in the center, all will praise it.\nThis place is called the **Dragon’s Den Domain** (龙穴地),\nAnd establishing a dwelling here will bring eternal honor.\n\nIf there are verdant hills behind, several **zhang** high,\nAnd before them a pond that rises with waves,\nWater flowing from the southeast in surging abundance,\nIt ascends nine layers, becoming officials and ministers.\n\nAll affairs proceed as desired, the family thrives,\nBuying neighboring fields on both sides.\nEven if one digs only three or four **chi** deep,\nThe front will be fertile, the rear will flourish.\n\nIf a path is dug before the tomb, it’s hard to endure,\nDescendants will scatter far away.\nThough they remain, they will be poor and destitute,\nAnd after twenty years, the family will fall into ruin.\n\nThe land like a **mantou** (steamed bun), low on all sides,\nWater flows outward through the **Long Creek** (长溪).\n\nHigh ridges are hard to establish upon—\nBuild no dwelling there, it is unfit.\nThe eight winds will scatter kin, cutting off descendants,\nMisjudging fate and fortune’s decline.\nWater seeping through green hills is rare in the world—\nDragon coils and tiger encircles, both auspicious.\n\nThe Black Tortoise Peak rises six tiers high,\nWith a central plot for a tomb’s foundation.\nIt breeds many clever, nimble descendants,\nFields, cattle, and granaries fill with wealth.\n\nThis land on both sides generates auspicious qi,\nWithin twenty years, a dragon ascends the pool.\nChicken and Tiger clash—most fortunate.\nDig three *chi* deep to find the dragon pond.\n\nDo not doubt—Dragon bones lie on either side,\nFront narrow, rear broad, like scales and orchids.\nEstablish a dwelling here for wealth and nobility,\nSure to bear noble sons, their names on golden tablets.\n\nHow could geomancers know the mysteries within?\nPurple qi soars, far-reaching in all directions.\nAvoiding absolute peaks for burial brings ruin,\nSerpents writhe, the land spawns poverty.\n\nFields sold off to distant lands,\nThis is the foolish, blind, and dim-eyed.\nTwo ditches dug before the tomb,\nBehind, a winding mound of earth.\n\nIf east-west paths cross before the tomb,\nDescendants will be violent, unkind.\nThis land is called *Pasture-Cow*—\nYear after year, disasters plague the family.\n\nDo not doubt—dig carefully and find\nA pair of stones within.\nFlat land with three mounds like peaks,\nCombined with *Shen-Mao* and the incoming dragon.\n\nNorth has ridges, west has paths,\nA central plot for the tomb’s reliance.\nThis formation is *Golden Rooster Embracing Egg*—\nSure to bring wealth and produce heroes.\n\nDo not doubt the auspicious qi within,\nDig three *chi* deep to find copper.\nBehind, families rise like peaks,\nAs if seated in a throne together.\n\nEstablish dwellings here for wealth and nobility,\nSage sons and virtuous grandsons, sealed in office.\nStopping winds, gathering qi—truly wondrous,\nPurple qi billows, drifting in all directions.\n\nForest trees encircle the ridges,\nA winding stream flows into the Long River.\nEast-west, dragons and tigers connect,\nSlope lands for dwellings bring great prosperity.\n\nLotus ponds and lotus fields—hard to recognize,\nDescendants’ orchids and cassia bring fame.\nDo not doubt—dig deep to observe:\nNine *chi* of vine roots remain.\n\nLand shaped like a drum—most strange,\nSurely a tomb and dwelling here.\nWhy seek mountains or divert water?\nFortune and prosperity, all affairs prosperous.\n\nBlack Tortoise high, Vermilion Bird low—\nIf a fortunate one is buried here,\nFields, livestock, and kin flourish.\nDescendants wear purple robes in generations.\n\nIf east-west halls or temples stand,\nDescendants will surely own vast estates.\nGold locks and jade bars—\nOnly avoid reverse-flowing water like arrows,\nOr descendants will meet ruin.\n\nEstablish dwellings—do not shun the sun.\nShunning the sun disrupts yin-yang balance,\nYet wealth and nobility cannot be preserved,\nOften leaving widows in empty rooms.\n\nBuild no dwellings facing east—\nEastward, water flows and vanishes.\nThough no immediate disaster strikes,\nWithin thirty years, misfortune is sure.\n\nBuild no dwellings facing west—\n*Kun-Shen* reverse-flow is hard to cure.\nThough wealth may come, it lasts but briefly,\nDescendants flee, four directions in ruin.\n\nBuild no dwellings facing north—\nNorth brings weeping ghosts and spirits.\nYouth wear tattered clothes on their backs,\nFinances lost, the house in decay.\n\nEstablish dwellings facing southeast—\nAll things face the sun, qi soars.\nPlant pines before, willows behind,\nFour sides protect, inner peace assured.\n\nHousehold peace, people at ease,\nAncestral sand and water bless descendants.\nDo not let mountains and water press upon officials’ fortune—\nFortune comes boundless, gradually rising.\n\nGreen Dragon’s *Yi* vein rises in peaks,\n*Bing-Ding* tides call it forth.\n*Geng-Xin* positions reveal serpent forms,\n*Ren-Gui* ridges stack high.\n\n*Wu-Yi* positions bury one tomb—\nDescendants become ministers and heroes.\nThis land is called *Four Ministers*—\nEstablish dwellings here for highest honor.\n\nSoutheast broad, forming peak thresholds,\n*Gen-Qian* facing harbors—most fitting.\nWest’s curves bend away,\nLet anyone build dwellings or tombs here.\n\nThis land is called *Phoenix*—\nSpring colors bloom in all seasons.\nIf a fortunate one is buried on the phoenix’s back,\nDescendants wear purple robes generation after generation.\n\n*Bing* ditches, *Ding* flows,\n*Xin-You* Green Dragon sets sail.\nFour surrounding ditches as four legs,\nNamed *Tortoise Land*—good for building towers.\n\nWhether living or buried here,\nDescendants thrive with ample fields.\nPigs, sheep, cattle, and horses in herds,\nWealth and nobility produce nobles.\n\nBlack Tortoise high, hills embrace,\nWater, granaries, and surplus wealth.\nMountains and water intersecting—supreme fortune.\nA winding stream flows both ways.\n\nThis land is called *Lion*—\nDescendants hold tablets, harmonizing gold.\nFront and back lack shared mountains and water—\nYet how does honor and longevity align?\n\nDo not doubt—dig three or four *chi* deep,\nA cluster of yang qi shines bright.\nFlatlands with ridges—\nRidges for dwellings bring great prosperity.\n\nEstablish dwellings facing southeast,\nAvoid reverse-flowing water—examine carefully.\nWater from the courtyard sells long,\nWells must hide toward the *Mao* side.\n\nOpen doors—do not defy the *Heavenly Stems* decree:\nThree, five, six, seven—disasters pile like mountains.\nOr as the *Wealth Door*—four, six, seven—\nFamily harmony, filial children, parents at peace.\n\nThe main hall’s front leans with a wall,\nDo not call it *Wind Arrow* piercing the hall.\nHeaven’s patterns and Earth’s logic clash,\nNine Palaces, Eight Trigrams determine yin-yang.\n\nEstablish dwellings—no direction is taboo,\nWhether flatlands or ridges.\nNo need for *Guo-Mo* or *Heavenly Stems* decrees,\nAll manner of dwellings bring household prosperity.\n\nWhy encircle flatlands to invite disaster?\nFamily broken, population lost.\n*Gen*’s secrets unknown—\nOnly then do *Guo-Mo*’s yin-yang reveal.\n\nThis land brings royal sons joyous and blessed,\nNo one knows—leaking Heaven’s secrets.\nEstablish dwellings—no need for geomancers,\nWhether ridges or lowlands.\n\nAlso, the year and month must align auspiciously,\nDiscussing yin-yang’s subtle decrees with masters.\n\n「家财破败人口伤，\nSay he is ill-fated—his fortune low and his kin harmed.\n\n本付天机真妙决，\nThe *Gen*’s secrets are indeed the true Dao’s subtle decrees—\n\n恐他与后错推寻，\nLest he misalign with posterity, seeking in vain.\n\n政将金锁重重论，\nThe *Jin Suo*’s intricate rules are meticulously debated—\n\n扫尽师人无细心，\nYet geomancers, in their haste, fail to discern the finer truths.\n\n认得天文和地理，\nOnly when one grasps Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s logic—\n\n才知妙理值千金，\nDoes the profound principle prove worth its weight in gold.\n\n金锁玉关非容易，\nThe *Jin Suo* and *Yu Guan* are no simple matters—\n\n熟习牢记莫为轻，\nMaster them well, commit them deep, and do not treat them lightly.\n\n仙家秘授真口诀，\nThe Daoist sages secretly impart the true *koujue*—\n\n细心参洋要当心，\nWith careful study, one must tread with utmost vigilance.\n\n困穷不过十三载，\nFor thirteen years, poverty shall not linger—\n\n看他家败又损丁，\nObserve how his household crumbles and his lineage dwindles.\n\n透出青山世所稀，\nPiercing green mountains—rare in the world—\n\n龙盘虎居两相宜，\nWhere *Dragon Coiling* and *Tiger Dwelling* harmonize.\n\n前面天池如月样，\nBefore him, a Heavenly Pool like the moon—\n\n西南丘陵乱箭堆，\nBehind, in the southwest, a ridge piled with *Luan Jian*—\n\n朝城后转贪狼势，\nFacing the *Chao Cheng*, turning toward the *Tian Lang*’s might—\n\n玄武昂昂文武归，\nThe *Xuan Wu* stands majestic, drawing both scholars and warriors.\n\n师人若识玄中妙，\nIf geomancers perceive its profound mysteries—\n\n中间一块作坟地，\nA central plot shall serve as burial ground—\n\n多生聪明贤进主，\nBlessing many a wise and virtuous heir—\n\n儿孙必到凤凰池，\nWhose descendants shall surely reach the *Feng Huang* Pool.\n\n紫气昂昂远四方，\nWith *Zi Qi* rising high and far—\n\n安营主宅最为良，\nThis dwelling is the finest for prosperity.\n\n左右允冲后无箭，\nWith *Yun Chong* on either side and no *Jian* behind—\n\n田园茂盛子孙昌，\nFields and gardens flourish, ensuring blessed offspring.\n\n平川之地没山岗，\nIn flatlands without ridges—\n\n踏看坟基取妙方，\nSurvey the burial site to find auspicious alignment.\n\n但看坟基高才用，\nOnly if the mound stands tall—\n\n花离唯要水流长，\nWith *Hua Li* distant yet water flowing far—\n\n会看远山流进水，\nOne must see distant mountains where water advances—\n\n龙吟虎啸两相当。\nThe *Dragon’s Roar* and *Tiger’s Cry* shall both thrive.\n\n八方周围寻戊已，\nSeek the *Wu Ji* directions in all eight surrounds—\n\n向近子午定山岗，\nFacing the *Zi Wu* lines to fix the ridges.\n\n雷上波涛总不宜，\nNever place where thunder’s waves surge—\n\n风吹疯瘫受孤凄，\nLest winds bring madness and loneliness, leaving one desolate.\n\n家门衰败难为厚，\nHis household shall decline, its fortune thin.\n\n儿孙逃脱走东西，\nHis descendants flee east and west—\n\n不请名师另安葬，\nIf he does not summon a master geomancer, another burial shall be sought—\n\n定然贫乏不相宜。\nSurely, it shall bring only poverty and ill-fortune.\n\n三叉河口葬个坟，\nAt the mouth of a trifurcated river, burying a tomb—\n\n水流左右要相应，\nWith water flowing symmetrically left and right—\n\n时师不识玄中妙，\nEven if the geomancer fails to grasp its mysteries—\n\n三十年中出贵人。\nWithin thirty years, a noble one shall emerge.\n\n坟田中间又葬坟，\nIn the center of a burial field, another tomb is laid—\n\n不知坟是什家人，\nUnclear whose kin this tomb belongs to—\n\n若是葬入他家祖，\nIf buried among another’s ancestors—\n\n定然存亡两不灵。\nSurely, life and death shall lose their resonance.\n\n丧家若不失人口，\nIf a mourning family does not lose its people—\n\n葬后不久死师人，\nSoon after burial, the geomancer dies—\n\n坟前坟后两家当，\nThe tombs before and behind belong to two households—\n\n人行左右实可伤。\nWalking past left and right, it truly brings sorrow.\n\n贫穷不过十三载，\nPoverty shall not last beyond thirteen years—\n\n看他家败与人亡，\nObserve how his household falls and his kin perish.\n\n墓前坟葬最不高，\nThe burial mound before his grave shall not rise high—\n\n必主儿孙四散逃。\nSurely, his descendants scatter in all directions.\n\n可恨师人无眼力，\nHow lamentable that geomancers lack insight—\n\n占他风水两相调，\nDisturbing his *fengshui* with reckless judgment—\n\n宅后沟河活水流，\nBehind his dwelling, a gully with living water flows—\n\n左皤右绕有刚柔。\nWith *Bai* on the left and *Rao* on the right, embodying both strength and gentleness.\n\n前面若有波涛流，\nIf waves surge before him—\n\n富贵荣华永不休。\nHis wealth and honor shall never cease.\n\n乾民广阔通大道，\nWith *Qian* people vast and the Way open—\n\n定生贵子出王侯。\nSurely, noble sons shall rise to royal ranks.\n\n人家宅后有池塘，\nIf a household’s dwelling has a pond behind—\n\n虽然富贵也不祥，\nThough wealth may come, it shall not be auspicious—\n\n定生风流浪荡子，\nSurely, wayward and roving sons shall be born—\n\n三十年中主败亡。\nWithin thirty years, his household shall decline.\n\n人家住宅要朝向，\nA dwelling’s orientation must be considered—\n\n玄武必要护峰场，\nWith *Xuan Wu* guarding the ridge—\n\n前柳后遗多吉庆，\nWith *Liu* before and *Yi* behind, joyous blessings abound—\n\n自然富贵足田庄。\nNaturally, wealth shall fill his fields.\n\n前面无遮朱雀孤，\nIf *Zhu Que* stands unobstructed before—\n\n后园无护玄武虚，\nAnd *Xuan Wu* is left unguarded behind—\n\n前后相遮多安稳，\nBut if both are shielded front and back—\n\n自然家道足丰余。\nHis household’s fortune shall be plentiful.\n\n营后池塘最不宜，\nA pond behind the dwelling is most ill-fated—\n\n定主儿孙四散离，\nSurely, his descendants scatter far—\n\n凶灾破败伤人口，\nDisasters strike, his household crumbles, and his kin are harmed—\n\n早请时师择地移。\nSwiftly summon a geomancer to shift the site.\n\n论砂一白方：后天坎卦，\nSpeaking of *Shui Sha*—the *Bai Fang*—in the *Post-Heaven Kan* Trigram—\n\n方位壬子癸，\nPositioned at *Ren Zi* and *Gui*—\n\n壬砂发武贵，\n*Ren Sha* brings martial nobility—\n\n秀峰高大位，\nWith a lofty, grand ridge—\n\n出入佳备有，\nOffering splendid approaches—\n\n大名振海内，\nHis great name shall resound across the land—\n\n再得丙水照，\nIf *Bing* water also illuminates—\n\n儿孙以文会，\nHis descendants shall excel in scholarship—\n\n子砂定发富，\n*Gui Sha* ensures wealth—\n\n家有金钱库，\nA household with a treasure trove of gold—\n\n形若兼破军，\nIts form resembling *Jian Po Jun*—\n\n兴家是寡妇，\nA widow shall prosper the family—\n\n远近午水照，\nWith *Wu* water illuminating near and far—\n\n丑名亦不顾，\nEven if its name is vulgar—\n\n癸砂女当家，\n*Gui Sha* empowers women—\n\n发在上元花，\nBlessing them in the *Shang Yuan Hua*—\n\n不问男和汉，\nRegardless of gender—\n\n惧内定数他，\nA household ruled by a formidable wife is fated—\n\n远近丁水秀，\nWith *Ding* water flowing nearby—\n\n丁财足可夸，\nHis wealth in *Ding* shall be abundant—\n\n形若葫芦样，\nIts form like a gourd—\n\n矮郎要怕她，\nLow-born sons must fear their mothers—\n\n坎卦砂兼有，\nIf *Kan* Trigram’s *Sha* is combined—\n\n形要梭子样，\nIts shape must resemble a shuttle—\n\n不问阴阳宅，\nRegardless of yin or yang in the dwelling—\n\n曲抱在其中，\nCurved and embracing within—\n\n立问宜留意，\nWhen erecting, one must take heed—\n\n不要逼压宫，\nLest it press upon the *Gong*—\n\n隔溪并隔水，\nSeparated by streams and waters—\n\n见之不为凶，\nThough seen, it shall not bring misfortune—\n\n形如中然断，\nIts form resembling a severed *Zhong Ran*—\n\n名为寒透风，\nCalled *Han Tou Feng*—\n\n丁损财亦耗，\n*Ding* brings both financial loss and depletion—\n\n定主不丰隆。\nSurely, his fortune shall not be grand.\n\n若无离水照，\nIf *Li* water does not illuminate—\n\n孤苦不贫穷，\nThough lonely and hardship may come—\n\n二黑方：后天坤卦，\nSpeaking of the *Hei Fang*—the *Post-Heaven Kun* Trigram—\n\n方位未坤申，\nPositioned at *Wei*, *Kun*, and *Shen*—\n\n朱砂能发财，\n*Zhu Sha* brings wealth—\n\n行为不正来，\nYet if actions are unrighteous—\n\n军赋与土匪，\nTaxes and bandits shall plague—\n\n名臭通六街，\nHis name shall stink through the streets—\n\n形若名夕秀，\nIts form resembling a *Ming Xi*—\n\n丑水照当怀，\nWith *Chou* water illuminating its heart—\n\n也可置田庄，\nIt may also serve as a field—\n\n农家乐和偕，\nA farmer’s joy shall be harmonious—\n\n坤砂叠叠起，\nIf *Kun Sha* rises in layers—\n\n真是上元花，\nTruly, it is the *Shang Yuan Hua*—\n\n妇女持家政，\nWomen shall manage the household—\n\n把酒喝桑麻，\nDrinking wine with hemp and mulberry—\n\n女儿个个俊，\nEach daughter shall be bright—\n\n发福庆万年。\nBlessing them with fortune for ten thousand years.\n\n若得艮水照，\nIf *Gen* water illuminates—\n\n血财发无涯，\nBlood and wealth shall flow endlessly—\n\n不许形破军，\nLest its form resemble *Po Jun*—\n\n七权与飞斜，\nWith *Qi Quan* and *Fei Xie*—\n\n申砂女儿美，\n*Shen Sha* blesses beautiful daughters—\n\n圆面与长腿，\nWith round faces and long legs—\n\n形若兼秀起，\nIts form resembling combined elegance—\n\n勤能通义理，\nDiligence brings understanding—\n\n若与寅水照，\nIf *Yin* water illuminates—\n\n丹青画优美，\nWith vermilion and ink painting exquisite scenes—\n\n坤砂砂完全，\nIf *Kun Sha* is complete—\n\n金城一照眠，\nWith a *Jin Cheng* illuminated once—\n\n上中丁财盛，\nAt the upper *Ding* position, wealth flourishes—\n\n家富积银钱，\nHis household shall be rich, amassing silver and gold—\n\n如得艮水照，\nIf *Gen* water illuminates—\n\n福寿又双全，\nFortune and longevity shall both be complete—\n\n局大官清正，\nWith grand influence and upright officials—\n\n内助有名贤，\nAnd virtuous scholars aiding within.\n\n三碧方：后天震卦，\nSpeaking of the *Bi Fang*—the *Post-Heaven Zhen* Trigram—\n\n方位甲卯乙，\nPositioned at *Jia*, *Mao*, and *Yi*—\n\n一马不断甲龙宫，\nA single *Dragon* horse shall not sever *Jia Long Gong*—\n\n上中时势大吉风。\nAt the upper *Shi* position, auspicious winds prevail.\n\n若得庚酉波浪起，\nIf *Geng* and *You* waves rise—\n\n管教顺利运不穷，\nSurely, his fortunes shall flow

worse.\nIf the front is narrow and the back is wide,\nProsperity shall be praised.\nThe family shall flourish, descendants rise to officialdom.\nFields and gardens abound with grain and silk.\nIf the front is wide and the back is narrow,\nThe family shall surely be impoverished.\nDescendants flee to distant lands,\nOnly because the gate’s wide mouth offends the **xiōng quán** (hostile forces).\n\nWhen **Fēng** (wind) and **léi** (thunder) are high and **Tiān zé** (heavenly land) is low,\nGrain and produce are plentiful, trade prospers.\nGoing out, carriages and horses follow in

fortune are complete.\nThe **gǔ bèi** (waistband) gleams with gold,\nVirtuous descendants emerge.\nIf the **lóng** (Dragon) approaches the grave in the right position,\nDescendants shall excel in every generation.\nFrom **Chén** to **Mǎo**, the **Qīng** (green) rises; from **Shēn** to **Wèi**, the **zé** (auspicious) descends—\n**Qián** waves and **Kǎn** hills bring fortune and longevity together.\nIf **Bǐng** and **Dīng** waters curve toward the **zhōng gōng** (central palace),\nGreen robes and symbols bring blessings to the **Dān wèi** (imperial steps).\nIf the **Yǒu** palace is high and the **Mǎo** palace is low,\nThe **wū** (foul) pool lies behind.\nWithin, **yáng** and **yīn** clash—\nNo harmony shall be found.\nThe widow in the chamber suffers loneliness.\nIn broad and

prosperous.\nBuy neighboring fields on left and right—\nNo need to dig three or four feet deep.\nLight and fertile, the front is narrow; the back, adorned with **xuān huá** (luxuriant plants).\nBefore

orchids**.\nBuilding homes here brings wealth and nobility—\nNoble sons shall hang on the **golden board** (imperial exams).\nHow could the **Master of Time** know the **Mysteries of the Profound**?\nPurple **qi** soars, far-reaching to all quarters.\nOn the **absolute peak**, bury a tomb—\nA **soaring serpent** in the **textured earth** brings poverty.\nFields sold off to distant lands—\nHere, the **Gēng-Tǔ legs** and **blind eyes** falter.\nBefore the tomb, two **culvert heads** are dug,\nBehind the camp, a winding mound of earth.\nIf east-west paths are trod by

endure,\nYet if **Xuanwu** rises high and **Juwu** sinks low,\nBefore the gate, **Nine Dragons** coil in channels,\nEast **Qinglong**, west **Baihu** entwine—\nLongevity and blessings pair, orphaned yet honored.\nWaters flow on both sides, surging at the center,\nHigh before, low behind—certain hardship,\nPeople and wealth scatter, legal troubles arise,\nBravery invites thieves, women grow wayward.\nWaters lap at lonely villages, coming and going—\nWithin lies mystery, hard to discern.\nThe common folk do not recognize its subtleties.\nMountains high, people thrive; waters high, wealth flows—\nThree **Xuanwu** peaks, **qi** soaring,\nWaters flow eastward, then surge back to the hall.\nPaths align with **Kun**’s **Dao**, traffic passes freely,\nNot kings, but pillars of the state.\nBehind the home, green mountains rise six **zhang** high,\nBefore it, a pond stirs with waves.\nSoutheast waters roll ceaselessly—\nNine layers ascend to become officials.\nWaters depart, mountains return—fortune and blessings complete,\nGolden belts encircle the waist, virtuous offspring born.\nIf the **Dragon**’s **Ling** aligns with the tomb’s center,\nDescendants through generations shall rise as **Kuiyuan**.\n**Chen** and **Mao** green, **Shen** and **Wei** at the end—\n**Kan**’s **Qiu** brings fortune and longevity equal.\n**Bing** and **Ding**’s winding waters face the **Gong**,\nGreen robes and elephant belts bow at the **Dan** steps.\n**You** high, hills rise; **Mao** low, plains stretch—\nAt **Wu**’s edge, broad and filthy behind,\nMen and women within bring chaos, no high or low.\nWidows in the chamber suffer loneliness,\nWide and level on all sides—\nWherever you build your home, it stands secure.\nNo need to ask of mountains or waters,\nThe household prospers in all things.\nBehind the camp, ditches and rivers—avoid at all cost,\nDescendants scatter east and west,\nYin’s eyes watch, bringing harm,\nLittle food, no clothing—widows suffer loneliness.\nGrass bright and clear, colors fine—\nA home in the center brings praise from all.\nThis place is called the **Dragon**’s **Xue**,\nBuilding here ensures glory and fortune,\nAll wishes granted, the household thrives.\nBuy neighboring fields on left and right,\nDo not dig three to four **chi** deep—\nLight soil before, narrow behind—luxury assured,\nA path before the tomb is hardest to endure,\nDescendants scatter far and wide,\nYet if they remain, poverty shall prevail.\nTwenty years later, the household falls.\nThe land like a steamed bun, low on all sides—\nWaters flow in four directions through the **Chang** River,\nHigh ridges and peaks make building difficult,\nCut off winds, and set up camp—avoid at all cost.\nEight winds disperse the people, fortune ends.\nMisjudge time and fate, and luck shall sink.\nWaters pierce green mountains—rare in the world,\n**Dragon** coils, **Tiger** encircles—both well-suited.\n**Xuanwu** like a peak, high six positions,\nA single stone in the center as the tomb’s base.»\n\n「Bright and prosperous, the household thrives,\nFields and cattle abound, wealth fully stored—\nThis land on both sides nurtures **auspicious qi**,\nIn twenty years, fortune leaps like a dragon in the pool.\n\nChicken and Coordinate **Xing** (卯) contend—most excellent,\nDig deep three **chi** to find the **Dragon Pond**—\nDo not doubt the left and right hold **Dragon bones**,\nFront narrow, back broad—scaled and fragrant like the **Jinlin Plant**.\n\nBuild homes and set up camps—wealth and nobility assured,\nNoble offspring shall rise, their names on the golden list.\nThe **Master of Time** knows not the profound subtleties—\nPurple **qi** ascends, radiant far in all directions.\n\nFollow the **absolute peaks** and valleys for the tomb—\nVibrant **Tengshe** coils through the earth, poverty shall grow.\nFields and livestock sold to distant lands,\nThis blind fool’s eyes are dim—\nBefore the tomb, two **Jue** ditches are dug,\nBehind the camp, a winding mound of earth.\nIf east and west have paths for men to tread,\nDescendants shall be fierce, not gentle.\n\nThis land is called **Pasture of Cattle**—\nDisaster and misfortune year by year.\nDo not doubt the careful digging—\nA pair of stones lies hidden within.\nFlat land with three **tomb mounds** like towering peaks,\nFurther joined by **Zhenmao** and the incoming **Dragon**.\n\nNorth has ridges, west has paths—\nA central stone as the tomb’s foundation.\nThis formation is **Golden Rooster Embracing the Egg**—\nWealth and nobility shall produce heroes.\nDo not doubt this place nurtures **auspicious qi**—\nDig deep three **chi** to see the copper gleam.\nBehind the dwelling, families rise like peaks,\nJust like joined chairs—equal in fortune.\nBuild homes and set up camps—wealth and nobility assured,\nSaints and sages among descendants shall guard the dynasty’s seal.\nStopping winds, gathering **qi**—truly wondrous,\nPurple **qi** billows, radiant in all directions.\n\nTall trees encircle the ridges,\nA winding stream flows through the **Chang** River.\nEast and west, **Dragon** and **Tiger** connect—\nSloping land for camps brings great fortune.\n\nLotus ponds and lotus fields—men fail to recognize,\nDescendants shall be orchids and cassia, voices refined.\nDo not doubt the careful deep excavation—\nNine **chi** vines stretch long and strange.\nThe earth like a drum—most wondrous indeed,\nCertainly a place for tombs and camps.\nWhy seek mountains to join or waters to avoid?\nFortune and prosperity shall gradually rise.\n\n**Xuanwu** high, **Zhushu** low—\nIf a fortunate man is buried here,\nFields and livestock shall flourish, descendants grow strong.\nLater generations in purple robes shall rise,\nNo mountains before or behind, no waters to cross—\nYet why should honor and fortune align?\n\nDo not doubt the careful digging three to four **chi**—\nA cluster of **yang qi** gleams brightly.\nFlat plains with ridges—camps here bring great fortune.\nIf east and west have **divine halls** or temples,\nDescendants shall surely have vast fields and granaries.\nBeware the **Fengjian** (风箭) piercing through the gate—\nLater generations shall meet ruin and defeat.\n\nBuild homes and set up camps—do not avoid the **yang** (sun).\nAvoiding **yang** disrupts the **yin**, fortune shall not last—\nLater generations shall guard empty rooms in solitude.\nDo not build homes or set up camps toward the west—\n**Kunshen** (坤申) reverses the water, hard to cure.\nThough fortune may not last long,\nDefeat and scattering shall surely come.\n\nDo not build homes or set up camps toward the north—\nThe master’s house shall weep with ghosts and spirits.\nYoung men’s clothes shall all be worn on their backs—\nFinances shall dwindle, the master’s house shall break.\n\nBuild homes and set up camps toward the southeast—\nAll things face the **yang**, their **qi** grand and exalted.\nPlant pines behind, willows before,\nSurround and protect on all sides—\nPeace and contentment shall fill the home,\nDescendants shall prosper with ancestral **sand** and **water**.\n\nDo not let **mountains** or **waters** encroach upon the **Official’s Peak**—\nFortune shall come without end, gradually ascending.\n\n**Qinglong** (青龙) rises from **Yi** (乙) vein—\n**Jingding** (丙丁) tides shall call it forth.\n**Gengxin** (庚辛) positions reveal the **Snake’s** form,\n**Renji** (壬癸) peaks stack high and grand.\n\n**Wuyi** (戊已) positions—bury one tomb—\nDescendants shall rise as **generals** and **ministers**, heroes.\n\nThis land is called **Four Ministers’ Ground**—\nCamps and dwellings here bring the highest fortune.\nSoutheast broad and open—build peaks and thresholds,\n**Gen** (艮) and **Qian** (乾) face the harbor—most excellent.\n\n**Ze** (泽) and **Xi** (西) curves embrace the edges—\nLet anyone build homes or tombs here.\nThis land is called **Phoenix Ground**—\nSpring colors face the **yang** in all seasons.\nIf a fortunate man is buried here,\nDescendants shall wear purple robes through generations.\n\n**Jing** (丙) brings ditches and **Ding** (丁) brings streams,\n**Xinyou** (辛酉)—**Qinglong** sets forth the boat.\nFour **Jue** ditches form the four feet—\nNamed **Turtle Ground**, excellent for building towers.\n\nWhether living or buried here,\nDescendants shall be strong, their fields vast.\nPigs, sheep, cattle, and horses walk in crowds—\nHonor and wealth shall produce **nobles**.\n\n**Xuanwu** high, hills embrace—\nWith waters, with granaries—abundant wealth.\nWhere **mountains** and **waters** meet—most auspicious.\n\nA winding stream flows toward the incoming—\nThis land is called **Lion Ground**—\nDescendants shall hold **Hu** (笏) and bow in harmony.\n\nBuild homes and set up camps toward the southeast—\nAvoid the flowing waters, examine the ridges carefully.\nWithin the courtyard, waters emerge from the **Chang** River’s edge,\nWells and springs must hide toward the **Mao** (卯) side.\nOpen doors—do not violate the **Tianxiang** (天罡) decree,\nThree, five, six, seven—disaster like mountains.\nOr like the **Caimen** (财门) of four, six, seven—\nA harmonious home, filial children bring the father’s peace.\n\nThe main hall faces forward, one wall slightly offset—\nDo not call the **Fengjian** (风箭) to pierce the gate.\nHeaven’s patterns and Earth’s logic are violated—\nThe **Nine Palaces** and **Eight Trigrams** determine **yin** and **yang**.\n\nBuild homes and set up camps—no direction is forbidden,\nWhether flat plains or mountain ridges—\nDo not question the **Guo** (郭) and **Mao** (摸) of the **Tianxiang** decree.\nAll manner of camps shall bring household prosperity—\nWhy court disaster by connecting the flat?\nThe master’s gate shall break, the population shall dwindle.\n\nThe **Gen** (艮) formation’s secret decree is unknown—\nOnly when known shall **Guo** (郭) and **Mao** (摸) reveal their **yin** and **yang**.\n\nHere, imperial sons bring joyous blessings—\nNo one knows to conceal the **Heaven’s Mechanism**.\nBuild homes and set up camps—no need for a **Master**—\nWhether ridges or high or low—\nFurther, the year and month must be auspicious.\nWhy seek the **Master** of **yin** and **yang** decrees?\nThe household shall break, its people shall suffer.\n\nHe speaks of **times** and **fates** misaligned—\nThis **Heaven’s Mechanism** is truly a wondrous decree.\nFear that later generations shall err in their search—\nDiscuss the **Jin Suo** (金锁) with weighty deliberation.\nSweep away all **Masters**—none shall have fine attention.\nOnly those who recognize **Heaven’s Patterns** and **Earth’s Logic**\nShall know the wondrous principles worth a thousand gold.\n\n**Jin Suo** (金锁) and **Yu Guan** (玉关) are not easy to grasp—\nMaster them thoroughly, do not treat them lightly.\n\n**Immortal** families secretly transmit the true **mouth decree**—\nCarefully ponder and reflect—\nPoverty shall not last beyond thirteen years.\nObserve how the household breaks and its people dwindle.\n\nWaters pierce green mountains—rare in the world,\n**Dragon** coils, **Tiger** resides—both well-suited.»\n\nBefore the **Heavenly Pool** like a moon’s shape,\nThe southwest hills rise in chaotic **arrow piles**—\nTurn toward the **Ming Tang** (贪狼) at dawn,\n**Xuan Wu** (玄武) looms, **Wen Wu** (文武) shall unite.\n\nIf the **Master** perceives the **Xuan**’s (玄) profound secrets,\nThe central plot shall serve as grave’s foundation—\nMany a sage and worthy shall advance as **House Lords**,\nTheir descendants shall rise to the **Feng Huang** (凤凰) **Pool**.\n\nPurple **qi** (紫气) ascends, far-reaching in all quarters—\nA well-situated **camp** for the **House Lord**’s abode.\nLeft and right, **Yun Chong** (允冲) flows without **arrows**—\nFields flourish, offspring thrive in endless plenty.\n\nFlatlands without hills—**no** fine **logic**,\nObserve the grave’s base for **wondrous patterns**.\nOnly high graves shall be used,\n**Flowers** part, but **water** must flow long.\n\nLearn to see distant mountains feeding streams—\n**Dragon’s** (龙) song and **Tiger’s** (虎) roar in perfect harmony.\nSearch all eight directions for **Wu Ji** (戊已),\nNear **zi-wu** (子午) lines, hills must be fixed.\n\n**Thunderous** waters and **waves**—**never** auspicious,\nWind howling, **madness** and **loneliness** shall prevail.\nThe **House** shall decline, **thick** with misfortune—\nDescendants flee east and west, **no** **Master** to guide.\n**Poverty** shall not last beyond thirteen years,\nSee the **House** fall and its people vanish.\n\n**Graves** before and behind—**low** in rank,\nTheir **House Lords**’ descendants shall scatter in flight.\n**Lamentable** are the **Masters**’ blind eyes—\nThey disrupt the **wind-water** (风水) of others.\nBehind the **camp**, a **living-water** (活水) **pool** flows,\nLeft **white** (皤), right **enveloping** (绕), **rigorous** yet **yielding**.\n\nIf **waves** surge before,\n**Wealth** and **honor** shall never cease—\n**Qian Min** (乾民) vast, the **Great Dao** (大道) open,\nA **House Lord** shall surely produce **noble offspring** (贵子).\n\nIf a **pool** lies behind the **House**,\nThough **wealthy**, it brings **no** **auspice** (祥),\n**Wind-flow** (风流) descendants shall squander fortunes—\nWithin thirty years, the **House** shall decline.\n\nA **House**’s **camp** must face the **right direction**,\n**Xuan Wu** (玄武) must guard the **peak’s** (峰) **field**.\n**Front willow, rear遗** (遗)—many blessings,\n**Naturally** wealthy, fields and **estates** full.\n\nIf **Zhu Que** (朱雀) stands **unobstructed** before,\nAnd **Xuan Wu** (玄武) lacks **protection** behind—\n**Front** and **rear** **obstructed**, **stability** assured,\nThe **House** shall prosper with **abundant virtue/power** (丰余).\n\n**Pools** behind the **camp**—**least** auspicious,\nDescendants shall scatter, **calamity** strikes—\n**House** and **people** suffer ruin.\n**Swiftly** seek a **Master** to relocate the **grave**.",

      "translated_text": "The **Fengshui Classics** (《风水经》):\n\n---\n**First Section (金锁玉关):**\n\nThe golden locks and jade barriers stand firm,\nWhere mixed porridge first opens the Five Directions.\nThe Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon align the Three Principles.\n\nThe Great Cycle’s square array scatters stars and constellations,\nThe clarity of Heaven and the turbidity of Earth harmonize Yin and Yang.\nWinds, rains, thunders, and lights all arise from the **qi** of the mountains.\nLofty ridges and broad waters hold auspicious designs.\n\nHeaven’s **Dao** and Earth’s foundation distinguish high and low,\nArranged in order, they receive the constant nurturing.\nPaired in Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, male and female form perfect duality.\n\nThe Four Seasons and Eight Festivals divide day and night,\nThe Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams connect with the **Tian Gang** (天罡).\nThe Five Phases inverted, pushing through a thousand revolutions—\nMetal, wood, water, fire, earth at the center.\n\nThe **One Hundred Twenty Divine Deities and Killing Stars**,\nThe **Ninety-Four Positions of Auspicious and Inauspicious Generals**,\nSome govern years, others months for prosperity,\nSome govern days, others times for fortune’s favor.\n\nWhen **Qian Mountain** (乾山) is high and **Gen Water** (艮水) thrives, the people flourish.\nWhen **Xun’s** (巽) upper reaches are full, great joy and auspiciousness prevail.\nWhen **Li’s** (离) upper reaches welcome the **Dragon**, it blesses the tomb’s location,\nAnd descendants through generations produce scholars.\n\nThe fields and villages teem with people year by year,\nPurple robes and golden belts adorn the morning rituals.\nThe winding paths before the gate curve and bend,\nBringing eternal honor and distant prosperity.\n\nOn the northwest roads, the **qi** is bold and swelling,\nThis place is called the **Auspicious Village** (吉庄).\nEach household prospers, rich in wealth and grandeur,\nAll four directions balanced—this is the Heavenly Realm.\n\nIf the front is high and the rear is low, it cannot endure,\nIf the rear is high and the front is low, the fields are vast.\nIf east is low and west is high, it’s called **Inverted Earth** (逆地),\nAnd water flows disrupting the **Zhen Palace** (震宫), not harmonizing.\n\nThough the water flows away without obstruction,\nIt also causes the people to scatter far.\nIf east is high and west is low, it’s the **Ze Domain** (泽地),\nAnd it’s decreed that future generations will produce virtuous and capable descendants.\n\nIf the **qi** flows strongly yet remains still, it brings wealth and honor,\nAnd future generations will become pillars of the state.\nIf there’s a pond behind the dwelling, it brings poverty and depletion,\nAnd also causes childlessness, hollow stomachs, and intestinal ailments.\n\nIf the front is directly struck by water, the **Five Arrows** (五箭) are harmed,\nAnd it’s decreed that tuberculosis and disasters will befall.\nIf the water surges past two positions above,\nDescendants will be licentious and lack authority.\n\nThough the water flows away without obstruction,\nThe pond behind the dwelling gradually decays.\nIf **Xun’s** (巽) upper reaches take water, it cannot last long,\nAnd though wealth and honor may come, it’s not truly auspicious.\n\nIf the rear of the hall is a foul land, it’s called the **Cutting Domain** (绝地),\nAnd the **Two Arrows of the Northeast** (东北两箭) are hardest to defend against.\nThough wealth and honor may come, they won’t endure long,\nAnd after fifteen years, misfortune will surely arrive.\n\nIf the rear is high and the front is low, it’s the highest auspice.\nIn the **Renzi Year** (壬子), the **Dragon** and **Tiger** ascend, cattle and sheep thrive.\nGranaries and treasure houses flourish abundantly,\nAnd wealth, honor, and auspiciousness prevail.\n\nIf there are hills behind and foul lands before,\nWinding paths that flow into the **Long River** (长江),\nWealth accumulates, people and livestock prosper,\nAnd descendants through generations enjoy longevity and fortune.\n\nIf the four sides are low and the center is high,\nWater flows outward like a blade of slaughter.\nThough the four directions may form **Dragon** and **Tiger** (龙虎),\nAfter twenty-four years, the family will suffer dispersal.\n\nIf there are stones before the gate, dust will scatter,\nBandits and thieves will bring calamity.\nEndless lawsuits and quarrels will plague the year,\nAnd the **Divine Arrows** (神箭) cannot ward off hidden strikes.\n\nIf the four sides are high and the center is low,\nThis place is called the **Hell Pond** (地狱池).\nThe household declines, unable to prosper.\nYin dominates, Yang decays, and affairs grow impoverished.\n\nIf the front is narrow and the rear is wide, it’s prosperous beyond measure,\nThe family thrives, wealth is certain.\nDescendants flourish, officials visit often,\nFields and gardens are abundant, filled with mulberry and hemp.\n\nIf the front is wide and the rear is narrow, it’s needless to say,\nThe family will be destitute, selling off all its lands.\nDescendants flee to distant places,\nOnly because the gate’s mouth is too broad, inviting **Killing Fists** (凶拳).\n\nIf the winds and thunders are high and the **Tianze** (天泽) is low,\nThere’s ample grain and sufficient harvest for prosperity.\nOutbound carriages and horses follow in abundance,\nAnd descendants through generations serve in officialdom.\n\nIf the left extends and the right contracts, it’s the most auspicious,\nWhen **Gen’s** (艮) upper reaches welcome the **Dragon**, people and wealth flourish.\n**Yingxing** (鹰行) and **Renyi** (人仪) bring harmony to the household,\nAnd descendants through generations wear purple robes.\n\nPigs, sheep, cattle, and horses gather in groups,\nForty years later, their prosperity will rise.\nIf **Zi** (子) and **Wu** (午) are both full, it brings broad fortune,\nAnd year after year, blessings and wealth will be drawn in.\n\nWhen encountering officials, joy and transformation bring auspice,\nA lifetime of robes and blessings, smiling faces open wide.\nThough wealth and honor may come, fields and properties flourish,\nDescendants will never be stripped of their prosperity.\n\nIf **Xuanwu** (玄武) is high and **Zhuqiao** (朱雀) is low,\nBefore the gate lie several **Nine-Dragon Lands** (九龙地).\nThe **Green Dragon** (青龙) comes from the east, the **White Tiger** (白虎) from the west,\nAnd longevity and fortune are complete, receiving **Guo Bei** (孤悖) blessings.\n\nIf water flows from both sides, striking the center,\nThe front is high and the rear is low—misfortune is certain.\nPeople and wealth scatter, inviting official troubles,\nAnd boldness leads to theft, while women act wantonly.\n\nIf water flows to and from a solitary village,\nIts mysteries are hard to discern.\n\n**Second Section (金锁玉关):**\n\nThe world’s people do not recognize its subtleties—\nMountains bring prosperity, waters bring wealth and fortune.\n\nThe **Three Mountains** (三山) and **Xuanwu** (玄武) rise with bold **qi**,\nWater flowing eastward returns to the hall like waves.\nThe paths surge through the **Kun Way** (坤道), connecting comings and goings,\nNot becoming nobles, but becoming pillars of the state.\n\nIf water flows away and mountains come, longevity and fortune are complete,\nAnd descendants wear golden belts, producing virtuous and beautiful offspring.\nIf the **Coming Dragon** (来龙) is properly aligned above the tomb,\nEach generation’s descendants will become leaders and scholars.\n\nIf **Chen** (辰) and **Mao** (卯) bring the **Green Dragon** (青龙) from the east,\nAnd **Shen** (申) and **Wei** (酉) welcome the **White Tiger** (白虎) from the west,\n**Bing** (丙) and **Ding** (丁) curve the waters toward the **Morning Court** (朝拱),\nAnd descendants wear green robes, bowing in the **Dan Palace** (丹墀).\n\nIf the **Xiu** (酉) position is high and the **Gao** (岗) is low,\nAnd the **Mao** (卯) position is low and the **Wu** (午) side is broad,\nMen and women within will be licentious, lacking high and low distinctions.\nWidows in the inner chambers endure loneliness and sorrow.\n\nIf the land is broad and the four sides are level,\nA dwelling may be established without concern for **qi** alignment.\nIt doesn’t matter if mountains come or waters flow,\nThe family will prosper, all affairs flourishing.\n\nIf there are trenches and rivers behind the dwelling, avoid them,\nFor descendants will scatter east and west.\n**Yin People** (阴人) with evil eyes will come to harm them,\nAnd they will suffer hunger, cold, and loneliness.\n\nIf the grass is lush and vibrant, the colors are fine,\nAnd the dwelling stands in the center, all will praise it.\nThis place is called the **Dragon’s Den Domain** (龙穴地),\nAnd establishing a dwelling here will bring eternal honor.\n\nIf there are verdant hills behind, several **zhang** high,\nAnd before them a pond that rises with waves,\nWater flowing from the southeast in surging abundance,\nIt ascends nine layers, becoming officials and ministers.\n\nAll affairs proceed as desired, the family thrives,\nBuying neighboring fields on both sides.\nEven if one digs only three or four **chi** deep,\nThe front will be fertile, the rear will flourish.\n\nIf a path is dug before the tomb, it’s hard to endure,\nDescendants will scatter far away.\nThough they remain, they will be poor and destitute,\nAnd after twenty years, the family will fall into ruin.\n\nThe land like a **mantou** (steamed bun), low on all sides,\nWater flows outward through the **Long Creek** (长溪).",

      "translated_text": "High ridges are hard to establish upon—\nBuild no dwelling there, it is unfit.\nThe eight winds will scatter kin, cutting off descendants,\nMisjudging fate and fortune’s decline.\nWater seeping through green hills is rare in the world—\nDragon coils and tiger encircles, both auspicious.\n\nThe Black Tortoise Peak rises six tiers high,\nWith a central plot for a tomb’s foundation.\nIt breeds many clever, nimble descendants,\nFields, cattle, and granaries fill with wealth.\n\nThis land on both sides generates auspicious qi,\nWithin twenty years, a dragon ascends the pool.\nChicken and Tiger clash—most fortunate.\nDig three *chi* deep to find the dragon pond.\n\nDo not doubt—Dragon bones lie on either side,\nFront narrow, rear broad, like scales and orchids.\nEstablish a dwelling here for wealth and nobility,\nSure to bear noble sons, their names on golden tablets.\n\nHow could geomancers know the mysteries within?\nPurple qi soars, far-reaching in all directions.\nAvoiding absolute peaks for burial brings ruin,\nSerpents writhe, the land spawns poverty.\n\nFields sold off to distant lands,\nThis is the foolish, blind, and dim-eyed.\nTwo ditches dug before the tomb,\nBehind, a winding mound of earth.\n\nIf east-west paths cross before the tomb,\nDescendants will be violent, unkind.\nThis land is called *Pasture-Cow*—\nYear after year, disasters plague the family.\n\nDo not doubt—dig carefully and find\nA pair of stones within.\nFlat land with three mounds like peaks,\nCombined with *Shen-Mao* and the incoming dragon.\n\nNorth has ridges, west has paths,\nA central plot for the tomb’s reliance.\nThis formation is *Golden Rooster Embracing Egg*—\nSure to bring wealth and produce heroes.\n\nDo not doubt the auspicious qi within,\nDig three *chi* deep to find copper.\nBehind, families rise like peaks,\nAs if seated in a throne together.\n\nEstablish dwellings here for wealth and nobility,\nSage sons and virtuous grandsons, sealed in office.\nStopping winds, gathering qi—truly wondrous,\nPurple qi billows, drifting in all directions.\n\nForest trees encircle the ridges,\nA winding stream flows into the Long River.\nEast-west, dragons and tigers connect,\nSlope lands for dwellings bring great prosperity.\n\nLotus ponds and lotus fields—hard to recognize,\nDescendants’ orchids and cassia bring fame.\nDo not doubt—dig deep to observe:\nNine *chi* of vine roots remain.\n\nLand shaped like a drum—most strange,\nSurely a tomb and dwelling here.\nWhy seek mountains or divert water?\nFortune and prosperity, all affairs prosperous.\n\nBlack Tortoise high, Vermilion Bird low—\nIf a fortunate one is buried here,\nFields, livestock, and kin flourish.\nDescendants wear purple robes in generations.\n\nIf east-west halls or temples stand,\nDescendants will surely own vast estates.\nGold locks and jade bars—\nOnly avoid reverse-flowing water like arrows,\nOr descendants will meet ruin.\n\nEstablish dwellings—do not shun the sun.\nShunning the sun disrupts yin-yang balance,\nYet wealth and nobility cannot be preserved,\nOften leaving widows in empty rooms.\n\nBuild no dwellings facing east—\nEastward, water flows and vanishes.\nThough no immediate disaster strikes,\nWithin thirty years, misfortune is sure.\n\nBuild no dwellings facing west—\n*Kun-Shen* reverse-flow is hard to cure.\nThough wealth may come, it lasts but briefly,\nDescendants flee, four directions in ruin.\n\nBuild no dwellings facing north—\nNorth brings weeping ghosts and spirits.\nYouth wear tattered clothes on their backs,\nFinances lost, the house in decay.\n\nEstablish dwellings facing southeast—\nAll things face the sun, qi soars.\nPlant pines before, willows behind,\nFour sides protect, inner peace assured.\n\nHousehold peace, people at ease,\nAncestral sand and water bless descendants.\nDo not let mountains and water press upon officials’ fortune—\nFortune comes boundless, gradually rising.\n\nGreen Dragon’s *Yi* vein rises in peaks,\n*Bing-Ding* tides call it forth.\n*Geng-Xin* positions reveal serpent forms,\n*Ren-Gui* ridges stack high.\n\n*Wu-Yi* positions bury one tomb—\nDescendants become ministers and heroes.\nThis land is called *Four Ministers*—\nEstablish dwellings here for highest honor.\n\nSoutheast broad, forming peak thresholds,\n*Gen-Qian* facing harbors—most fitting.\nWest’s curves bend away,\nLet anyone build dwellings or tombs here.\n\nThis land is called *Phoenix*—\nSpring colors bloom in all seasons.\nIf a fortunate one is buried on the phoenix’s back,\nDescendants wear purple robes generation after generation.\n\n*Bing* ditches, *Ding* flows,\n*Xin-You* Green Dragon sets sail.\nFour surrounding ditches as four legs,\nNamed *Tortoise Land*—good for building towers.\n\nWhether living or buried here,\nDescendants thrive with ample fields.\nPigs, sheep, cattle, and horses in herds,\nWealth and nobility produce nobles.\n\nBlack Tortoise high, hills embrace,\nWater, granaries, and surplus wealth.\nMountains and water intersecting—supreme fortune.\nA winding stream flows both ways.\n\nThis land is called *Lion*—\nDescendants hold tablets, harmonizing gold.\nFront and back lack shared mountains and water—\nYet how does honor and longevity align?\n\nDo not doubt—dig three or four *chi* deep,\nA cluster of yang qi shines bright.\nFlatlands with ridges—\nRidges for dwellings bring great prosperity.\n\nEstablish dwellings facing southeast,\nAvoid reverse-flowing water—examine carefully.\nWater from the courtyard sells long,\nWells must hide toward the *Mao* side.\n\nOpen doors—do not defy the *Heavenly Stems* decree:\nThree, five, six, seven—disasters pile like mountains.\nOr as the *Wealth Door*—four, six, seven—\nFamily harmony, filial children, parents at peace.\n\nThe main hall’s front leans with a wall,\nDo not call it *Wind Arrow* piercing the hall.\nHeaven’s patterns and Earth’s logic clash,\nNine Palaces, Eight Trigrams determine yin-yang.\n\nEstablish dwellings—no direction is taboo,\nWhether flatlands or ridges.\nNo need for *Guo-Mo* or *Heavenly Stems* decrees,\nAll manner of dwellings bring household prosperity.\n\nWhy encircle flatlands to invite disaster?\nFamily broken, population lost.\n*Gen*’s secrets unknown—\nOnly then do *Guo-Mo*’s yin-yang reveal.\n\nThis land brings royal sons joyous and blessed,\nNo one knows—leaking Heaven’s secrets.\nEstablish dwellings—no need for geomancers,\nWhether ridges or lowlands.\n\nAlso, the year and month must align auspiciously,\nDiscussing yin-yang’s subtle decrees with masters.",
      "overlap_context": "airs proceed as desired, the family thrives,\nBuying neighboring fields on both sides.\nEven if one digs only three or four **chi** deep,\nThe front will be fertile, the rear will flourish.\n\nIf a path is dug before the tomb, it’s hard to endure,\nDescendants will scatter far away.\nThough they remain, they will be poor and destitute,\nAnd after twenty years, the family will fall into ruin.\n\nThe land like a **mantou** (steamed bun), low on all sides,\nWater flows outward through the **Long Creek** (长溪).",

reach the *Feng Huang* Pool.\n\n紫气昂昂远四方，\nWith *Zi Qi* rising high and far—\n\n安营主宅最为良，\nThis dwelling is the finest for prosperity.\n\n左右允冲后无箭，\nWith *Yun Chong* on either side and no *Jian* behind—\n\n田园茂盛子孙昌，\nFields and gardens flourish, ensuring blessed offspring.\n\n平川之地没山岗，\nIn flatlands without ridges—\n\n踏看坟基取妙方，\nSurvey the burial site to find auspicious alignment.\n\n但看坟基高才用，\nOnly if the mound stands tall—\n\n花离唯要水流长，\nWith *Hua Li* distant yet water flowing far—\n\n会看远山流进水，\nOne must see distant mountains where water advances—\n\n龙吟虎啸两相当。\nThe *Dragon’s Roar* and *Tiger’s Cry* shall both thrive.\n\n八方周围寻戊已，\nSeek the *Wu Ji* directions in all eight surrounds—\n\n向近子午定山岗，\nFacing the *Zi Wu* lines to fix the ridges.\n\n雷上波涛总不宜，\nNever place where thunder’s waves surge—\n\n风吹疯瘫受孤凄，\nLest winds bring madness and loneliness, leaving one desolate.\n\n家门衰败难为厚，\nHis household shall decline, its fortune thin.\n\n儿孙逃脱走东西，\nHis descendants flee east and west—\n\n不请名师另安葬，\nIf he does not summon a master geomancer, another burial shall be sought—\n\n定然贫乏不相宜。\nSurely, it shall bring only poverty and ill-fortune.\n\n三叉河口葬个坟，\nAt the mouth of a trifurcated river, burying a tomb—\n\n水流左右要相应，\nWith water flowing symmetrically left and right—\n\n时师不识玄中妙，\nEven if the geomancer fails to grasp its mysteries—\n\n三十年中出贵人。\nWithin thirty years, a noble one shall emerge.\n\n坟田中间又葬坟，\nIn the center of a burial field, another tomb is laid—\n\n不知坟是什家人，\nUnclear whose kin this tomb belongs to—\n\n若是葬入他家祖，\nIf buried among another’s ancestors—\n\n定然存亡两不灵。\nSurely, life and death shall lose their resonance.\n\n丧家若不失人口，\nIf a mourning family does not lose its people—\n\n葬后不久死师人，\nSoon after burial, the geomancer dies—\n\n坟前坟后两家当，\nThe tombs before and behind belong to two households—\n\n人行左右实可伤。\nWalking past left and right, it truly brings sorrow.\n\n贫穷不过十三载，\nPoverty shall not last beyond thirteen

directions.\n\n可恨师人无眼力，\nHow lamentable that geomancers lack insight—\n\n占他风水两相调，\nDisturbing his *fengshui* with reckless judgment—\n\n宅后沟河活水流，\nBehind his dwelling, a gully with living water flows—\n\n左皤右绕有刚柔。\nWith *Bai* on the left and *Rao* on the right, embodying both strength and gentleness.\n\n前面若有波涛流，\nIf waves surge before him—\n\n富贵荣华永不休。\nHis wealth and honor shall never

wealth may come, it shall not be auspicious—\n\n定生风流浪荡子，\nSurely, wayward and roving sons shall be born—\n\n三十年中主败亡。\nWithin thirty years, his household shall decline.\n\n人家住宅要朝向，\nA dwelling’s orientation must be considered—\n\n玄武必要护峰场，\nWith *Xuan Wu* guarding the ridge—\n\n前柳后遗多吉庆，\nWith *Liu* before and *Yi* behind, joyous blessings abound—\n\n自然富贵足田庄。\nNaturally, wealth shall fill his fields.\n\n前面无遮朱雀孤，\nIf *Zhu Que* stands unobstructed before—\n\n后园无护玄武虚，\nAnd *Xuan Wu* is left unguarded behind—\n\n前后相遮多安稳，\nBut if both are shielded front and back—\n\n自然家道足丰余。\nHis household’s fortune shall be plentiful.\n\n营后池塘最不宜，\nA pond behind the dwelling is most ill-fated—\n\n定主儿孙四散离，\nSurely, his descendants scatter far—\n\n凶灾破败伤人口，\nDisasters strike, his household crumbles, and his

      "translated_text": "「Bright and prosperous, the household thrives,\nFields and cattle abound, wealth fully stored—\nThis land on both sides nurtures **auspicious qi**,\nIn twenty years, fortune leaps like a dragon in the pool.\n\nChicken and Coordinate **Xing** (卯) contend—most excellent,\nDig deep three **chi** to find the **Dragon Pond**—\nDo not doubt the left and right hold **Dragon bones**,\nFront narrow, back broad—scaled and fragrant like the **Jinlin Plant**.\n\nBuild homes and set up camps—wealth and nobility assured,\nNoble offspring shall rise, their names on the golden list.\nThe **Master of Time** knows not the profound subtleties—\nPurple **qi** ascends, radiant far in all directions.\n\nFollow the **absolute peaks** and valleys for the tomb—\nVibrant **Tengshe** coils through the earth, poverty shall grow.\nFields and livestock sold to distant lands,\nThis blind fool’s eyes are dim—\nBefore the tomb, two **Jue** ditches are dug,\nBehind the camp, a winding mound of earth.\nIf east and west have paths for men to tread,\nDescendants shall be fierce, not gentle.\n\nThis land is called **Pasture of Cattle**—\nDisaster and misfortune year by year.\nDo not doubt the careful digging—\nA pair of stones lies hidden within.\nFlat land with three **tomb mounds** like towering peaks,\nFurther joined by **Zhenmao** and the incoming **Dragon**.\n\nNorth has ridges, west has paths—\nA central stone as the tomb’s foundation.\nThis formation is **Golden Rooster Embracing the Egg**—\nWealth and nobility shall produce heroes.\nDo not doubt this place nurtures **auspicious qi**—\nDig deep three **chi** to see the copper gleam.\nBehind the dwelling, families rise like peaks,\nJust like joined chairs—equal in fortune.\nBuild homes and set up camps—wealth and nobility assured,\nSaints and sages among descendants shall guard the dynasty’s seal.\nStopping winds, gathering **qi**—truly wondrous,\nPurple **qi** billows, radiant in all directions.\n\nTall trees encircle the ridges,\nA winding stream flows through the **Chang** River.\nEast and west, **Dragon** and **Tiger** connect—\nSloping land for camps brings great fortune.\n\nLotus ponds and lotus fields—men fail to recognize,\nDescendants shall be orchids and cassia, voices refined.\nDo not doubt the careful deep excavation—\nNine **chi** vines stretch long and strange.\nThe earth like a drum—most wondrous indeed,\nCertainly a place for tombs and camps.\nWhy seek mountains to join or waters to avoid?\nFortune and prosperity shall gradually rise.\n\n**Xuanwu** high, **Zhushu** low—\nIf a fortunate man is buried here,\nFields and livestock shall flourish, descendants grow strong.\nLater generations in purple robes shall rise,\nNo mountains before or behind, no waters to cross—\nYet why should honor and fortune align?\n\nDo not doubt the careful digging three to four **chi**—\nA cluster of **yang qi** gleams brightly.\nFlat plains with ridges—camps here bring great fortune.\nIf east and west have **divine halls** or temples,\nDescendants shall surely have vast fields and granaries.\nBeware the **Fengjian** (风箭) piercing through the gate—\nLater generations shall meet ruin and defeat.\n\nBuild homes and set up camps—do not avoid the **yang** (sun).\nAvoiding **yang** disrupts the **yin**, fortune shall not last—\nLater generations shall guard empty rooms in solitude.\nDo not build homes or set up camps toward the west—\n**Kunshen** (坤申) reverses the water, hard to cure.\nThough fortune may not last long,\nDefeat and scattering shall surely come.\n\nDo not build homes or set up camps toward the north—\nThe master’s house shall weep with ghosts and spirits.\nYoung men’s clothes shall all be worn on their backs—\nFinances shall dwindle, the master’s house shall break.\n\nBuild homes and set up camps toward the southeast—\nAll things face the **yang**, their **qi** grand and exalted.\nPlant pines behind, willows before,\nSurround and protect on all sides—\nPeace and contentment shall fill the home,\nDescendants shall prosper with ancestral **sand** and **water**.\n\nDo not let **mountains** or **waters** encroach upon the **Official’s Peak**—\nFortune shall come without end, gradually ascending.\n\n**Qinglong** (青龙) rises from **Yi** (乙) vein—\n**Jingding** (丙丁) tides shall call it forth.\n**Gengxin** (庚辛) positions reveal the **Snake’s** form,\n**Renji** (壬癸) peaks stack high and grand.\n\n**Wuyi** (戊已) positions—bury one tomb—\nDescendants shall rise as **generals** and **ministers**, heroes.\n\nThis land is called **Four Ministers’ Ground**—\nCamps and dwellings here bring the highest fortune.\nSoutheast broad and open—build peaks and thresholds,\n**Gen** (艮) and **Qian** (乾) face the harbor—most excellent.\n\n**Ze** (泽) and **Xi** (西) curves embrace the edges—\nLet anyone build homes or tombs here.\nThis land is called **Phoenix Ground**—\nSpring colors face the **yang** in all seasons.\nIf a fortunate man is buried here,\nDescendants shall wear purple robes through generations.\n\n**Jing** (丙) brings ditches and **Ding** (丁) brings streams,\n**Xinyou** (辛酉)—**Qinglong** sets forth the boat.\nFour **Jue** ditches form the four feet—\nNamed **Turtle Ground**, excellent for building towers.\n\nWhether living or buried here,\nDescendants shall be strong, their fields vast.\nPigs, sheep, cattle, and horses walk in crowds—\nHonor and wealth shall produce **nobles**.\n\n**Xuanwu** high, hills embrace—\nWith waters, with granaries—abundant wealth.\nWhere **mountains** and **waters** meet—most auspicious.\n\nA winding stream flows toward the incoming—\nThis land is called **Lion Ground**—\nDescendants shall hold **Hu** (笏) and bow in harmony.\n\nBuild homes and set up camps toward the southeast—\nAvoid the flowing waters, examine the ridges carefully.\nWithin the courtyard, waters emerge from the **Chang** River’s edge,\nWells and springs must hide toward the **Mao** (卯) side.\nOpen doors—do not violate the **Tianxiang** (天罡) decree,\nThree, five, six, seven—disaster like mountains.\nOr like the **Caimen** (财门) of four, six, seven—\nA harmonious home, filial children bring the father’s peace.\n\nThe main hall faces forward, one wall slightly offset—\nDo not call the **Fengjian** (风箭) to pierce the gate.\nHeaven’s patterns and Earth’s logic are violated—\nThe **Nine Palaces** and **Eight Trigrams** determine **yin** and **yang**.\n\nBuild homes and set up camps—no direction is forbidden,\nWhether flat plains or mountain ridges—\nDo not question the **Guo** (郭) and **Mao** (摸) of the **Tianxiang** decree.\nAll manner of camps shall bring household prosperity—\nWhy court disaster by connecting the flat?\nThe master’s gate shall break, the population shall dwindle.\n\nThe **Gen** (艮) formation’s secret decree is unknown—\nOnly when known shall **Guo** (郭) and **Mao** (摸) reveal their **yin** and **yang**.\n\nHere, imperial sons bring joyous blessings—\nNo one knows to conceal the **Heaven’s Mechanism**.\nBuild homes and set up camps—no need for a **Master**—\nWhether ridges or high or low—\nFurther, the year and month must be auspicious.\nWhy seek the **Master** of **yin** and **yang** decrees?\nThe household shall break, its people shall suffer.\n\nHe speaks of **times** and **fates** misaligned—\nThis **Heaven’s Mechanism** is truly a wondrous decree.\nFear that later generations shall err in their search—\nDiscuss the **Jin Suo** (金锁) with weighty deliberation.\nSweep away all **Masters**—none shall have fine attention.\nOnly those who recognize **Heaven’s Patterns** and **Earth’s Logic**\nShall know the wondrous principles worth a thousand gold.\n\n**Jin Suo** (金锁) and **Yu Guan** (玉关) are not easy to grasp—\nMaster them thoroughly, do not treat them lightly.\n\n**Immortal** families secretly transmit the true **mouth decree**—\nCarefully ponder and reflect—\nPoverty shall not last beyond thirteen years.\nObserve how the household breaks and its people dwindle.\n\nWaters pierce green mountains—rare in the world,\n**Dragon** coils, **Tiger** resides—both well-suited.»",
