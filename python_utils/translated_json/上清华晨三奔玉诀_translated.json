  "full_translation": "**The Jade Instructions of the Three Rushing Stars of the Radiant Dawn of Highest Clarity**\n\n*Title:* The Jade Instructions of the Three Rushing Stars of the Radiant Dawn of Highest Clarity. Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It expounds the method of meditating upon the descent of spirits, ascending as an immortal, and rushing toward the Northern Culmen. One scroll. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Dongxuan Section, Jade Instructions category.\n\n---\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord said: If you desire long life, you must visualize the Nine Stars. If you desire to ascend as a perfected one, you must know the Jade Dawn. If you desire to soar and fly, you must diligently practice the Three Rushings.\n\nThese refer to the Assistant and Guardian Stars beneath the Flourishing Canopy within the Northern Culmen of the Dipper. When the Two Modes reposed in the womb and the myriad transformations had yet to unfold, the Three Luminaries concealed their brilliance, and the Three Qi intermingled in misty fusion. They gathered their crystalline essence and contained their radiance, congealing into Three Stars. The arrayed luminaries could not partake of their function, nor could the sun and moon interfere with their governance.\n\nThe Three Qi are the mysterious root to which the ten thousand spirits return. Above, they form the foundation of the capital of the Great Sage Treasure Sovereign of the Three Realms; below, they spread as the handle of the pivot of the Three Luminaries. At their center lie the Hall of Light, the Grotto Chamber, and the Perfected Cinnabar of the Mysterious Elixir, giving birth to the Three Ones Perfected, the spirits of the Infant and the Yellow Court. Through them, one masters life and death, concealment and dissolution, transformation and communion, flight and rushing, and eternal existence—all proceeds from this.\n\nBeneath the Flourishing Canopy, at its deepest and most resplendent point, lies the unmoving star of the Northern Culmen. This is the refined essence of the Jade Dawn Mysterious August Great Dao Lord, the true star of the Jade Emperor. It shades the Flourishing Canopy, rides the Dipper Chariot, roams the Nine Heavens, attends the Nine Sages, serves the thousand perfected, dwells in the Mysterious Terrace, and holds office in the Jade Clarity.\n\nThe Assistant Star is the spirit of the Most High Jade Emperor, the essence of the Golden Gate of Supreme Peace and the Posterior Sage Thearch. The Guardian Star is the numen of the Jade August Thearch of the Supreme Tenuity Heaven. The Assistant is called the Eight Sceneries; the Guardian, the Seven Dawns. These are the great spirits of the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper, the Emperor’s honor. Above, they assist the Jade Emperor; below, they nurture the primordial. They are the vanguard of the ten thousand qi, the first to enact the Dao. They are the true ones of the Jade Emperor of Highest Clarity, bestowed with the Seven Radiant Fallings, the Flowing Gold Fire Bells, and the Eight Scenery Chariot, with which they ascend to pay court to the Jade Dawn.\n\nThe method: When the stars appear, spread a mat facing north, burn incense, and bow nine times with the heart. Sit evenly, clasp the hands, close the eyes, and visualize the Three Stars each emitting qi of purple radiance and jade hue, descending to infuse your body. The sky is clear and serene, clouds gather from the four directions, wind and mist withdraw from the mountains, and your entire being shines with unified brilliance, boundless in scope. The light penetrates the five viscera, ascends to roam between the Mud Pill and the pupils of the eyes, the root of the tongue, and the divisions of the body. The purple qi swirls in radiant coils, encircling the nine layers. Swallow the qi and saliva twenty-seven times, knock the teeth nine times, and recite the secret incantation:\n\n*\"High Perfected of the Jade Emperor, the Three Mysteries bow to your division. Left Assistant, Right Guardian, Central Culmen of Purple Dawn, flowing essence of the mysterious void, penetrating the nine revolutions. Refine and temper the bodily vessel, golden bones and verdant sinews. The Three Emperors descend to connect, merging form in shared rushing. Accumulated emerald, treasure mantle, numinous flying skirts. Adorned with the Radiant Fallings, girded with Flowing Bells. Sun and moon as flanking guards, dragon and tiger as winged wheels. Eight Scenery Jade Chariot, establishing the Seven Dawns of the Celestial Chapters. Ascend to the utmost Jade Scenery, minister to the Jade Emperor.\"*\n\nVisualize the purple radiance and jade hue within the Three Stars illuminating the boundless, merging the stars and the ten thousand things into one. Imagine the Three Stars as large as the red sun, their purple rays extending in eight directions. From the left Assistant’s hanging light emerges an infant, head crowned with the Heavenly Dawn Treasure Diadem, clad in purple embroidered robes. Riding the qi, it descends before you. Knock the teeth nine times and secretly invoke: *\"Left Assistant Divine Palace, August Spirit of the Jade Emperor, Golden Gate Posterior Sage, Supreme Peace Thearch.\"* Silently intone the character *nie* twice and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Essence of the Emperor Star, hall of the Posterior Sage, Supreme Peace Thearch, king of Highest Clarity. Overseer of the ten thousand perfected, silently summoning yin and yang. Bestow upon me the Dao’s instructions, grant me the wondrous method. Heavenly tassel and jade robe, head crowned with mysterious radiance. Fulfill my sincere wish, that I may dwell in the Purple Chamber.\"*\n\n[Visualize] the Right Guardian Divine Palace, the Jade August Spirit of the Vermilion Jade Chamber, the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity. Form and attire as before. Knock the teeth and secretly invoke, silently intone the character *hui* three times, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"August Sage of Supreme Tenuity, master of the pivot’s mechanism. Guardian and assistant to the mysterious constancy, dispersing the ten thousand spirits. Flowing essence to the Mud Pill, refining and congealing the hundred bones. Sever the womb’s bonds, cut the roots, and the seven ancestors ascend as immortals. The corpse’s knots are severed, bestow upon me the feathered regalia. Robes of state and embroidered skirts, eternally returning together.\"*\n\nImagine the Assistant and Guardian Perfected Emperors at your left and right, floating in the light above your head. Next, visualize the purple qi and flowing radiance of the August Star beneath the Flourishing Canopy descending to infuse the Two Emperors and your body. Look up to see the Jade Emperor’s boundless treasure crown, crimson brocade and jade robes, form like an infant, holding a jade seal. Nine-colored round light illuminates heaven and earth. Knock the teeth and secretly invoke: *\"Jade Capital, Golden Gate, Most Sage and Most Perfected Jade Dawn Purple Palace Jade Emperor Supreme Thearch.\"* Silently intone the character *qi* three times and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Through ten thousand kalpas of opening and closing, the honor of the Jade Emperor. Dragon robes and phoenix seal—none dare not submit. Utmost perfection, nameless, naturally the Highest Sage. Descending to the humble self, the Three Sceneries float as a barge. Sharing the Emperor’s chariot, ascending to the Heaven of Jade Dawn. Deliver me from life and death, open and aid the Nine Mysteries. The Emperor’s grace and my heart—no before or after. Flying form to Jade Clarity, commanding the Celestial Origin.\"*\n\nImagine the Three Emperors lifting you to float within the nine-colored void. Soon you see the Eight Scenery Chariot of treasure jade and emerald mist, drawn by nine dragons, ascending together with you. Attending the Emperor’s chariot, surrounded by a hundred million riders and ten thousand mounts, you ascend directly to the midst of the Jade Dawn. There, you forget your form.\n\nPractice diligently for five years, and the Posterior Sage will descend as a perfected one. After seven years, you will ascend together to the Jade Dawn, roaming and racing through the ten thousand heavens.\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord said: Before the Three Qi divided, chaos was without form, reposed in profound obscurity, beyond the grasp of thought—it was but a single emptiness.\n\nThe void abides in emptiness and stillness; when stillness reaches its utmost, clarity arises—yet this clarity does not originate from birth, nor can its cause be known. What is called clarity is the present awareness of the mysterious; clarity establishes the essence, while darkness contends against it. When clarity prevails, it is yang; when darkness prevails, it is yin. Steamed, it becomes water; softened, it becomes earth; congealed, it becomes metal; agitated, it becomes fire; surging, it becomes wood; dispersed, it becomes the ten thousand things; flowing, it becomes transformation; coagulated, it becomes bounded realms. Heaven and earth and the hundred treasures are but what you yourself possess.\n\nYou are what you enact: in movement, categories communicate through their natures, and humans and beasts each have their knowledge; in stillness, categories communicate through their forms, and the ten thousand things each have their images. Movement and stillness have never been separate—humans and things embody each other’s functions. Thus life has its nature, and nature has the capacity for knowledge. Originally without knowledge, it is termed \"knowledge\" only by virtue of form’s return to the constant nature, which has no end and no beginning.\n\nHeaven and earth and the ten thousand things are of the same kind, each receiving its root and seed from the natureless nature. Humans and beasts differ, wood and stone are distinct, yet the five flavors remain unchanged since antiquity, and the single qi constantly transforms in the present. The sage penetrates the Dao, thus arriving without traveling and perceiving without seeing. The multitude, benighted in the Dao, drift and do not return, taking the real for a thief. They do not understand that the ten thousand things are one thing, that heaven and humanity share a single qi—only their coagulated forms and fixed roots set them apart.\n\nThe Dao has no life or death. Splitting firewood scatters its clarity; it is like planting grain—one seed multiplies into ten thousand, and this year’s grain is not last year’s grain, yet it has never ceased to be grain. So too with humans and things: the eyes of people today see as the eyes of the ancients saw—seeing is merely the capacity to see, not the vision of the ancients transmitted to the eyes of today. Their seed is firm, their kind is fixed, their qi and savor do not transgress one another, and their clarity is constant. What is called constant clarity is the inherent luminosity of the essence, not a single clarity that never changes.\n\nThus the multitude remembers and forgets, lives and dies, while the ordinary and the sage remain far apart. The supreme principle is manifest, transformations are evident—if one attains the real and forgets emotion, repeatedly dying and living without altering one’s inherent nature, then creation is mastered by the self. Though one becomes coeval with heaven and earth, where can one flee? When one’s body merges with the Dao, humans, beasts, things, self, fortune, and misfortune are no longer matters for discussion.\n\nThe sage transcends the realm of the Dao; the perfected reaches the ultimate in the divine homeland. Abiding in the subtle and formless without contention, one shares the radiance of the highest virtue. Know the three ascents of my discourse, and all will be accomplished—this is transmitted to those of true attainment and mysterious uprightness. Present three cinnabar-jade rings and one bolt of dark-cloud brocade as the covenant, in accordance with the statutes of the Highest Clarity.\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord said: The practices of other paths do not reach the Jade Emperor. Only in attaining the Emperor does one reach the ultimate. The Jade Emperor is the father and mother of heaven, earth, and the ten thousand spirits. Now, preserving the true essence of my original birth, the spirit of the primordial embryo, returning the root to its origin and reverting to the beginning of life—even so, the Dao may still be attained. How much more so when one commands heaven and earth, skillfully carves the myriad forms, and employs yin and yang to enact virtue and the Dao?\n\nOnly the three ascents of the Jade Emperor constitute the supreme Dao. The Jade Emperor pours his essence into the Lord of the Hall of Light; the Posterior Sage penetrates the spirit of the Cavern Chamber; the Grand Tenuity sits upon the golden couch within the heart of the mysterious cinnabar. Above, it connects to the true ones of the Jade Dawn, the Supreme Ultimate, the Jade Pass, and the Purple Palace. Here ends the *Jade Instructions on the Three Ascents of the Highest Clarity*.",

      "translated_text": "The void abides in emptiness and stillness; when stillness reaches its utmost, clarity arises—yet this clarity does not originate from birth, nor can its cause be known. What is called clarity is the present awareness of the mysterious; clarity establishes the essence, while darkness contends against it. When clarity prevails, it is yang; when darkness prevails, it is yin. Steamed, it becomes water; softened, it becomes earth; congealed, it becomes metal; agitated, it becomes fire; surging, it becomes wood; dispersed, it becomes the ten thousand things; flowing, it becomes transformation; coagulated, it becomes bounded realms. Heaven and earth and the hundred treasures are but what you yourself possess.\n\nYou are what you enact: in movement, categories communicate through their natures, and humans and beasts each have their knowledge; in stillness, categories communicate through their forms, and the ten thousand things each have their images. Movement and stillness have never been separate—humans and things embody each other’s functions. Thus life has its nature, and nature has the capacity for knowledge. Originally without knowledge, it is termed \"knowledge\" only by virtue of form’s return to the constant nature, which has no end and no beginning.\n\nHeaven and earth and the ten thousand things are of the same kind, each receiving its root and seed from the natureless nature.

So too with humans and things: the eyes of people today see as the eyes of the ancients saw—seeing is merely the capacity to see, not the vision of the ancients transmitted to the eyes of today.
