  "full_translation": "**Title:** *Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s* **Yin Fu Jing** *(Obscure Classic)*\n\n**Author:** *Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s* **Yin Fu Jing** *by Tang Chun (唐淳), compiled in the* **Jingyi (己丑)** *year of the reign* **Zhengda (正大)** *of Emperor Aizong of Jin (金哀宗). Two volumes. Source text:* **Zhengtong Daozang (正统道藏)***, Treasure of the Cavern of Perfection (洞真部), Jade Precepts (玉诀类).*\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s* **Yin Fu Jing** *\n\nOnly those who penetrate the profound mysteries of the heavens can elucidate the subtleties of the **Dao/Way**. How could one who has not yet attained the realm of the sages interpret the sages’ scriptures?\n\nWhy so? The sages’ words are vast as the heavens—how could those who do not delve into enigmas and unravel hidden meanings ever grasp them?\n\nTake, for instance, the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing*—its chapters are but one or two, its text scarcely three hundred words. Though concise in expression, its meaning is profound and distant; though simple in form, its intent is boundless and intricate.\n\nSome may take it as a method for enriching the state and securing the people, others as a strategy for strengthening armies and achieving victory. It encompasses all of heaven and earth, synthesizes the principles of **yin and yang**, yet appears without form or sound—so subtle that one can intuitively perceive its essence, yet so elusive that its depths cannot be fully plumbed.\n\nUnless one’s inner and outer self is clear and unobstructed, one’s surface and depths polished and refined, unless one can grasp the **Dao/Way** of heaven and earth and command the interplay of **yin and yang**, who could first dissect and then annotate it?\n\nYet many have commented on this text, but only Master Tang has truly captured the sages’ subtle intent.\n\nMaster Tang’s given name was **Chun (淳)**, and he styled himself the **Jinling Daoist (金陵道人)**. His origins remain unknown.\n\nThus, he expounded what he had heard, aligned with the sages’ intent, and supplemented with references from other works to verify it. For those who come after, when they read the original text, they may find its profundity and remoteness daunting—but when they consult his commentary, they will discover its clarity and accessibility.\n\nEach word he elucidates is like a lamp dispelling darkness; each phrase he interprets is like a tortoise shell divining doubt.\n\nHad Master Tang not inherently known the source of all existence, had he not deeply explored the origins of **creation/transformation (造化)**, had he not penetrated the **Dao/Way’s** mysteries and entered the sages’ realm, how could he have achieved this?\n\nIn recent times, **Yingran Zi (莹然子)**—a disciple of **Zhou Zhiming (周至明)**—has emerged, a scholar of our age. Inspired by the Yellow Emperor’s legends while visiting the **Kongtong Mountains (崆峒)**, he was moved by a desire to preserve and refine the **Dao/Way**, and thus sought this annotated text to engrave and print it.\n\nMay practitioners of the **Dao/Way** thereby discern the true from the false, attain sainthood while remaining in the mortal realm, hold **yin and yang** in their palms, and encompass the sun and moon within their chests—truly embodying the sages’ original purpose.\n\nHe requested I write a preface, and though I wished to decline, I feared the sin of not praising a worthy friend.\n\nThus, I took up my brush and composed this, merely to honor Master Tang’s noble endeavor.\n\nWritten in the **Jingyi (己丑)** year of **Zhengda (正大)**, at **Huoze (濩泽)**, by **Meng Shao (孟绰)**.\n\n**Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s* **Yin Fu Jing** *, Volume One*\n*Annotated by Jinling Daoist Tang Chun (金陵道人 唐淳注)*\n\n「The *Bao Yi* Chapter on the Dao/Way of the Immortals and Divine Ones\nThe divine, when in the eyes, is vision;\nwhen in the ears, is hearing;\nwhen in the tongue, is speech;\nwhen in the nose, perceives fragrance;\nwhen in the hands, manifests as clenched fists;\nwhen in the feet, becomes movement.\n\nBy day, it takes form as thought;\nby night, as dreams.\nWhen summoned, it comes;\nwhen dismissed, it departs.\nIn the mind, it is will;\nin speech, it is eloquence.\n\nBetween formlessness, it gathers and scatters without trace.\nWithin, it becomes emotional states;\nwithout, it dissolves into emptiness.\nWhen scattered, it permeates the cosmos and the Nine Barbarians—nowhere is untouched.\nWhen concealed, it enters even minute dust particles and sesame seeds.\n\nIt resides in the **elixir field (Dan Tian)**, and when cultivated, one becomes an immortal.\n\nIf one is dull and confused, the excess becomes a lower ghost.\nScattered, it is the mind;\ngathered, it is the **qi**.\nWhen **qi** moves, the divine moves;\nwhen **qi** gathers, the divine gathers.\n\nThe *Yijing (I Ching)* says: *\"The unfathomable interplay of yin and yang is called the divine.\"*\n\nIt further states: *\"The divine dwells in the elixir field; the **qi** condenses into an embryo.\"*\nTrue **qi** does not disperse,\nthe divine and luminous naturally arise.\nThus, the divine and **qi** mutually uphold one another—\nis this not the Dao/Way of longevity?\n\nThe divine is the child of **qi**,\n**qi** is the mother of the divine.\nThe *Dao De Jing (Laozi’s Classic of the Dao)* says: *\"Knowing its child, yet preserving its mother.\"*\n\nTang Chun says: *\"The mutual preservation of child and mother is the Dao/Way of the immortals.\"*\n\nMaster Shi Zhenren says: *\"If divine and **qi** do not disperse,\none is naturally a longevity cultivator.\"*\n\nThe term *immortal (xian)* means *transcendence*.\nCommon folk call those who attain the Dao/Way *immortals*,\nwhere the character *xian* (仙) is *ren* (人) beside *shan* (山, mountain).\nWhen common folk refine themselves,\ntheir nature is like mountains and rivers—\ntheir divine **qi** undisturbed and unshaken,\nthus, *ren* beside *shan* also.\n\nThe terms *immortals and divine ones (shenxian)* are titles for those who have attained the Dao/Way.\nJust as people call others *郎 (lang)*—\na term for those with wealth and status—\n*immortals* refers to those who have cultivated the Dao/Way and embraced the treasures within.\n\n*Bao* (抱) means *to embrace and conceal*.\n*Yi* (一) signifies the *Dao/Way*.\nThus, the chapter *\"Bao Yi\"* is indeed the beginning of the exposition on the Dao/Way.\n\nTo observe the Dao/Way of Heaven,\nand to grasp Heaven’s operations—\nthat is all.\n\n*Observe (guan)* means *to contemplate*,\nwith the upper tone as *guan* (官, official) and the lower as *guan* (贯, pierce).\nTo look upward is to observe;\nto look downward is to observe.\n*Observe* refers to the contemplation of the Six Gates.\n\nThe Buddhist school says: *\"To internalize the external forms and return them to the mind is called contemplation (guanxiang).\"*\nThus, it is called the *locking of the Six Gates*—\nwithin, nothing escapes;\nwithout, nothing enters—\nthis is the method of *guanxing*.\n\nTo look upward is to observe;\n*Observe* means *to perceive*.\nTo perceive the Dao/Way of Heaven,\nthe **North Dipper (Bei Dou)** aligns directly below,\nthe **True One of the Supreme Unity (Tai Yi Zhen Jun)** is the **qi** of Heaven—\nits name is **Tai Yi** (太一).\n\nThe **Yin True One (Yin Zhen Jun)** says: *\"Tai Yi contains the true **qi**.\"*\n\nCommon texts state:\n*\"To store it is the **original essence (Yuan Jing)**;\nto apply it is **vitality (Wan Ling)**;\nto contain it is **Tai Yi**;\nto release it is **Tai Qing (太清)**.\"*\n\nWhen **Tai Yi** descends directly,\nthe **True One (Zhen Yi)** operates;\nwhen **Tai Yi** ascends directly,\nthe **North Dipper** aligns with its symbols.\n\nThe **Dipper (Dou)** is the handle;\nmerely observe the **North Dipper’s** monthly stations—\nthe Dao/Way of Heaven observed in the first month’s station,\nthe **Tiger (Yin)** in the **Tiger** month—\ncycling endlessly without cessation.\n\nOne **qi** ascends and descends,\nthe sun and moon revolve;\nthe **Five Stars** and **Six Celestial Lights (Liu Yao)**,\narranged in myriad forms—\nall operate in harmony.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Five days mark a **host (hou)**,\nfifteen days mark a **qi**,\nforty-five days mark a **node (jie)**,\nninety days mark a **season (ji)**.\"*\n\nSpring generates, summer lengthens,\nautumn harvests, winter stores.\nIt gives rise to all things—\nHeaven above, Heaven below,\npalaces of the immortals, realm of mortals,\nembryos, eggs, damp transformations—\none root, one sprout,\none branch, one leaf,\none blossom, one fruit—\nsentient and insentient alike,\nall receive the **Dao/Way’s qi** and are thereby produced.\n\nThus, all things within and without are none other than the Dao/Way itself.\nTherefore, when one perceives the Dao/Way of Heaven’s operations,\none also observes that human cultivation does not differ from Heaven’s Dao/Way.\n\nThe Dao/Way of humanity:\n**Tai Yi** resides between the two kidneys,\nwith a yellow center in the hall,\nred above and black below,\nblue-green to the left and white to the right—\nits embrace of the Five Phases,\nthe **Supreme Unity (Hun Yuan Yi)**,\nthe **True One (Zhen Yi)**,\nis called **Tai Yi**.\n\n**Tai Yi** is the sovereign name of **water**.\nThe **North Dipper’s** alignment is the **seven orifices of the heart (Xin Qi Qiao)**.\nThe sun and moon are the **heart and kidneys**.\nHumans without sun and moon,\nuse the heart and kidneys as sun and moon;\nHeaven without heart and kidneys,\nuses the sun and moon as heart and kidneys.\n\nThe **Five Stars** and **Six Celestial Lights** correspond to the **Five Zang Organs** and **Six Fu Organs**.\nThe *\"myriad forms\"* are the **36,000 divine lights** of skin, hair, bones, and joints.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says: *\"Without leaving one’s door, one knows the affairs of the world.\"*\nMaster He Shang Gong says: *\"The human body is likened to Heaven and Earth’s operations.\"*\n\nMoreover, when one aligns their own **Tai Yi** with its celestial movement,\nthe sun and moon revolve in harmony,\nand the true essence is attained.\n\nWhen the **heart’s fire** descends and the **kidney’s water** ascends,\nwater above and fire below,\nthe **Five Zang Organs** and **hundred meridians** produce **vital fluids (jin ye)**.\nThe **qi**, **vital fluids**, **blood**, and **divine lights** flow naturally,\nthe **Five Phases**, **Four Symbols**, **Eight Trigrams**, and **myriad divine essences** return to the Great Dao/Way.\nThe **hundred bones** and **nine orifices** attain **spiritual responsiveness (Tong Ling)**,\nthe hands grasp **Tai Yi**,\nand **life and vitality are secured**.\n\nIf one follows the Dao/Way of Heaven’s operations,\nwill they not live as long as Heaven and Earth?\nThus it is said: *\"To grasp Heaven’s operations—\nthat is all.\"*\n\nTherefore, the sages point to Heaven’s Dao/Way,\nand liken human cultivation to observing Heaven’s operations.\nTo grasp Heaven’s operations,\nthere is none who does not become an immortal.\n\nHeaven has **Five Thieves (Wu Ze)**;\nthose who perceive them flourish.\nTo obtain the thieves is to flourish;\nto lose them is to perish.\n\nThe **Seven Worthies (Qi Xian)** say:\n*\"The Five Stars, Five Mountains, Five Zang Organs, Five Directions, and Five Thieves—\nthese are the Five Thieves’ alignment with the Five Phases,\na treasure held by the profound scholars,\nall-encompassing in meaning.\"*\n\nTang Chun says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth employ the Five Phases,\neach alternately restraining and generating the others.\nHeaven’s Five Thieves are:\n**wood, water, metal, earth, and fire**;\nEarth’s Five Thieves are:\n**metal, wood, water, fire, and earth**.\n\nThe sages say that Heaven’s Five Thieves move in reverse,\nyin and yang inverted and returning;\nEarth’s Five Thieves follow Earth’s natural order,\nthus humans have life and death.\n\nIf one perceives Heaven’s thieves,\nand operates in accordance with them,\nthen humans have only life and no death.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Those who perceive them flourish.\"*\n\nMoreover, when observing Earth’s Five Phases,\n**metal** generates **water**—\nbut Heaven’s Five Phases are otherwise,\nfor **water** generates **metal** instead.»\n\nWhen observing **water-qi** ascending as vapor,\ntransforming into clouds in the sky—\nsince Heaven belongs to **metal**,\nand cloud-qi ascends to Heaven,\nit is said: *\"Water comes to generate **metal**.\"*\n\nSon perceives Mother, manifesting its original form,\nand becomes rain.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Clouds move and rain is bestowed,\nall things flourish in their forms.\"*\n\nThis is the **Dao/Way of Heaven** moving in reverse.\n\nMoreover, when observing Earth’s Five Phases,\n**wood** generates **fire**—\nbut Heaven’s Five Phases are otherwise,\nfor **fire** generates **wood** instead.\n\nIn humans, this is **qi**; in Heaven, it is the **Great Sun**.\nWhen **true-qi** gives rise to all things,\nit is **yang-qi** entering **wood**,\ncausing branches and leaves to sprout,\nperfuming and nourishing all things—\neven stones and wood flourish.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Fire generates **wood**.\"*\nIs this not the **Dao/Way of Heaven**?\n\nTherefore, the sages point to Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,\nurging people to embody Heaven’s laws.\nIf one does not act in reverse,\nthey will not attain longevity.\nTo achieve longevity, one must practice inverted methods.\n\nWhat is the method of inverted Five Phases?\nTake the **heart-fire** arising from **kidney-water**—\nwhen **water** perceives **fire**, it transforms into **qi**,\nand this **qi** ascends to the **lungs**,\nsince the **lungs** belong to **metal**—\nthis is **water** generating **metal**.\n\nThe **water** then transforms into **golden liquid**,\nwhich enters the **liver**.\nThe **liver** is **wood**; the **heart** is **fire**.\nWhen **fire** comes to generate **wood**,\nthe **liver** flourishes, and the eyes shine brightly,\ntheir black and white clearly distinct.\n\n**Wood** takes on the nature of **fire**,\n**metal** takes on the essence of **water**—\nthe **Southern Fire** generates the **Eastern Wood**,\nthe **Northern Water** generates the **Western Metal**.\n\nThe **Four Symbols** and **Two Principles** are further combined with the **Steel-and-Water Earth** (戊己土), hence it is said that the **Five Phases do not proceed in order**, and when the **Four Symbols** merge into the **Central Palace**, it is called the **Method of Inverted Five Phases**.\n\nThe **True Master Taibai** said:\n*The Method of Inverted Five Phases*—\nthe **Dragon emerges from fire**.\n\n*The Five Phases do not proceed in order*—\nthe **Tiger is born in water**.\n\nThe **True One Son** said:\nThese twenty characters—\nfew in number yet profound in meaning—\nare called **revealing the mutual interplay of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nThe **Yin True Lord** said:\nThe **true qi of the North** is called the **River Vehicle**,\nwhile the **East’s Jia-Yi** forms **golden sand**.\nThe **Vermilion Bird** regulates its movement to generate **golden splendor**,\nand **golden splendor** produces the **Heaven-Earth Treasure**.\n\nIf one comprehends these words,\nharmonizing **inner and outer Dao**,\naligning with the **Heaven-Earth Way**,\nand refining essence into **spiritual elixir**,\nthen **transmuting the Four Great Elements**,\none may ascend lightly—\nis this not the **Dao of Immortals and Transcendents**?\nThus it is said:\n*Those who perceive this flourish.*\n\nThe **Five Bandits** reside in the heart,\nand their influence extends to Heaven.\nThe **Five Bandits** in the heart—\nthese are the **true qi of the Five Phases**.\nWith the heart as sovereign,\nmovement stirs the Five Phases in response.\nThus it is said:\n*The Five Bandits reside in the heart.*\n\nWhen their influence extends to Heaven,\none must align with the **Heavenly Dao**,\nfor all good and evil originate from the heart.\nAll actions must conform to Heaven’s **Way**,\nand when the heart acts,\nit harmonizes with the **Five Bandits of Heaven** in their operations.\n\nThe **universe lies within the hand**,\nand **ten thousand transformations arise from the body**.\nThe **universe lies within the hand**,\nand **ten thousand transformations arise from the body**—\nthis is where **Immortal cultivation begins**,\nthe **craft of sages and worthies**,\nthe **authority of yin and yang**.\n\nYin and yang—\nthese are **Sun and Moon**.\nThe **Sun is the Dragon**,\nthe **Moon is the Tiger**;\nthe **Sun is Mercury**,\nthe **Moon is Lead**;\nthe **Sun is Li**,\nthe **Moon is Kan**;\nthe **Sun is Fire**,\nthe **Moon is Water**;\nthe **Sun is the yang soul**,\nthe **Moon is the yin spirit**;\nthe **Sun is qi**,\nthe **Moon is essence**;\nthe **Sun is nature**,\nthe **Moon is fate**.\n\nHe who grasps the universe\nholds **life and death in his hand**.\nMy fate lies within me,\nnot in Heaven—\nin Heaven, it is the **Sun and Moon**;\nin man, it is **essence and qi**.\nHeaven moves by the **Sun and Moon’s revolution**,\nwhile man moves by the **circulation of essence and qi**.\n\nThe **True Master Lü** said:\nWhen someone asked me of the **cultivation method**,\nI pointed to the **Sun and Moon’s wheel** in the sky.\n\n**Wei Boyang’s** *Parametric Contract* sings:\n*The Sage seizes the intent of Creation,*\n*supporting Sun and Moon within the furnace.*\n*Subtly reversing Heaven-Earth’s essence,*\n*drilling through yin and yang to command spirits.*\n*If one recognizes the Sun’s soul and Moon’s spirit,*\n*the knower is a child of the Immortals.*\n*Refine and ingest for a thousand days—*\n*when the body lacks no yin, how can death come?*\n\nThe *Plain Questions* [□] *On Ancient Celestial Truth* says:\n*I have heard that the ancient True Ones upheld Heaven and Earth,*\n*grasped yin and yang,*\n*inhaled essence-qi,*\n*stood alone guarding the spirit,*\n*their flesh and muscles unified—*\n*thus they could live as long as Heaven and Earth,*\n*without beginning or end.*\n\nZhang Menggan said:\n*Containing Heaven and Earth in the palm,*\n*gathering and dispersing the Three Celestial Lights;*\n*holding Sun and Moon at the chest,*\n*rolling and unfolding the Eight Scenes.*\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says:\n*Deep roots and firm foundations—*\n*the Dao of eternal life and longevity.*\n\nThe **Sun and Moon reside in heart and kidney**,\nthe **heart is prone to movement**,\nthe **spirit prone to leaking essence**.\nThus the **Sage restrains the heart from moving**,\ngrasp the **kidney to prevent leakage**—\nwhen firm and unbroken,\nthe body becomes light,\nand thus **eternal life and longevity** are attained.\nIs this not the **starting point of Immortal cultivation**,\nwhere **heart and kidney interact**,\n**essence and qi reverse**,\nand **ten thousand transformations arise from the body**?\n\nThus it is said:\n*The mechanisms of Immortal transformation—*\n*to turn ghosts into Immortals,*\n*to revive the dead as the living—*\n*this is the universe within the hand.*\n\nWhen **Heaven unleashes the killing intent**,\n**dragons and serpents rise from the earth**.\n\nThis is the **inner alchemy of the Three Hundred Characters**—\n**Heaven’s nature** is **humanity**;\n**human heart** is the **mechanism**.\nEstablishing **Heaven’s Way** to **determine humanity**.\nThese sixteen characters were added by **Du Guangting**.\n\nChun said:\nWhen **Heaven unleashes the killing intent**,\nit is the **third month of autumn**,\nwhen the **West’s metal-qi** brings frost,\ncapable of killing all things.\nMetal can overcome wood,\nso dragons and serpents retreat underground,\nand all things may be killed.\nThe *Dao De Jing* says:\n*Heaven and Earth are not kind—they treat all things as sacrificial dogs.*\n\n**Dragons and serpents rising from the earth**—\nthis is the **third month of spring**,\nwhen all things sprout,\nand Heaven-Earth renew.\nAutumn kills, spring generates—\nthis is the **principle of the Way**.\nSpring is the **Tai co-ordinate**,\nautumn is the **Pi co-ordinate**—\nspring generates, autumn kills—\nthis is the **meaning of Heaven-Earth’s reversal**.\n\nWhen **humanity unleashes the killing intent**,\n**Heaven and Earth reverse**.\nThe greatest **human killing intent** is **filial disobedience**,\na crime without pardon,\nhence **Heaven and Earth reverse**.\n\nThe **cultivator of killing intent** refines **one qi** to ascend,\nthe **Three Corpses die of themselves**,\n**nine pests are exterminated**,\n**Creation’s elixir is forged**,\nand **pure yang** becomes the body—\nthus it is called the **killing intent**.\n\nWhen **Heaven and Earth reverse**,\n**Creation’s one qi** revives the dead,\nthus **yin and yang, Heaven and Earth, reverse**.\n\nWhen **Heaven and humanity act in unison**,\n**ten thousand transformations find their foundation**.\n\n**Heaven and humanity**—\nthis is **one qi**.\n**Acting in unison**—\nthis is the **initial stir of ascending yang**.\n**Ten thousand transformations**—\nthis is the **change of all things**.\n**Foundation**—\nthis is when all things move by **qi**,\nand it is called **establishing the foundation**.\n\n**Nature has skill and clumsiness**,\nand can be **concealed and hidden**.\n**Law and nature are fundamentally one**,\nyet **root natures differ**.\nTake **licorice as sweet**,\n**yellow gentian as bitter**—\nthough both stem from **one qi and one root**,\ntheir natures differ.\nHumans have **natures of skill and clumsiness**,\nwhich can be **hidden and concealed**.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*The ruler, if not secretive, loses his ministers;\nthe minister, if not secretive, loses his life;\nsecrets of affairs, if not kept hidden, bring ruin.*\nFrom this, it is said:\nThe **Dao** originates from the **Five Phases**,\nso one must know the **nature and disposition** of the Five Phases,\neach acting according to its **Phase**,\nall relying on **concealment and concealment**.\n\nThe *Lüzi* says:\n*When the mountain ape sees cunning, it will surely invite calamity.*\n\n「The mountain ape, a kind of monkey, excels at dodging arrows. When the King of Chu went hunting, the mountain ape circled around a tree, and the king, seeing its skill, commanded Yang Youji to shoot it. Youji aimed his arrow, but the mountain ape clung to the tree and cried, knowing Youji was a master archer and that it could not escape—it would surely die. Thus it is said: *Skill invites misfortune*; even if a man is supremely skilled, he cannot escape death unless it is by **Dao/Way’s** design. The **Nine Orifices**’s malice lies in the **Three Senses**, which govern movement and stillness.\n\nThe **Nine Orifices** reside in the heart, which contains seven orifices: three fine openings hidden within, and two that conceal **yin and yang**’s essence, one orifice as **yin**, one as **yang**, serving as aids. The **Sovereign**—if he is the heart’s king—thus commands the heart’s nine openings. The **Three Senses**—ears, eyes, and mouth—can perceive **evil colors**, hear **evil sounds**, and taste **evil flavors**. The heart’s nine orifices receive these sensory delights, and so **malicious qi** enters, stirring movement? It lies in the **Three Senses**: if the eyes do not gaze upon **evil colors**, the ears do not listen to **evil sounds**, and the mouth does not indulge **evil flavors**, then the heart’s orifices refuse **malicious qi**, and stillness is achieved.\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*Clarify the heart, and the spirit will naturally be pure;\nthe six desires will cease to arise,\nand the three poisons will be annihilated.*\n\nHumans are divided into **seventy-five grades**—the top **twenty-five grades**, the middle **twenty-five grades**, and the lowest **twenty-five grades**. These are further classified into **nine ranks**: the highest rank of the top grades has a heart with nine orifices; the highest rank of the middle grades has a heart with seven orifices; the highest rank of the lower grades has a heart with five openings. The lowest rank of the lowest grades has no orifices at all in the heart; such a person is called **foolish**, no different from a brute beast. The teachings of the **Three Senses** are meant to guard the heart, for they are the gateway to **movement and stillness, life and death**.\n\n**Fire arises from wood**—when misfortune strikes, it will surely prevail.\nWhen **fire arises from wood**, it is the **Dao/Way’s** inverse course;\nwhen **wood generates fire**, it is the **earthly nature’s** proper flow.\nMisfortune strikes and prevails because the **earthly nature’s** proper flow is at work: wood is punished and burns itself;\nthe **Dao/Way’s** inverse course means wood thrives and flourishes.\n\nThe **Dao/Way of the human body** follows the **earthly nature’s** proper course—when aligned, it leads to death;\nwhen opposing the **Dao/Way’s** inverse course, it brings life.\nThe **foolish man** takes his body as wood and lets his heart’s fire rage unchecked—his ignorance and lack of awareness corrupt his body, and when misfortune strikes, it prevails. This is the **foolish man**.\n\nThe **Sage**, however, treats his body as wood and his heart as fire—he extinguishes its source, refines and cultivates his body, and through **dark transformation** of form and essence, becomes a **Sage**.\n\n**Deceit arises in the realm**—when the time moves, it will surely collapse.\n**Lustful and malicious qi** disturb the heart, dispersing **spirit and qi**.\nWhen the time moves, it will collapse: **spirit and qi** depart from the body, and the heart scatters in ruin.\n*The Laozi* says:\n*Take the body as the realm,\ntake **essence-qi** as the people—\nwhen the people scatter, the realm will fall.*\nHe who knows this and practices **refinement** is called a **Sage**.\n\n**Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life**—this is the **Dao/Way’s** principle.\nIf one encounters a **Sage** and receives the **oral precepts**,\nknows the methods of **refinement**,\nand applies them at **child and wu times**,\ndiligently practicing to transmute the **common mortal’s** coarse bones and turbid **embryonic essence**,\none may attain **limitless longevity**—\nsuch a one is called a **Sage**.\n\n*End of the Yellow Emperor’s* **Obscure Correspondences Classic** *Commentary, Volume One. Begin of Volume Two.*\n\n「The Daoist Master from Jinling, Tang Chun’s commentary on the *Rich Realm and Peaceful People* chapter of the *Laozi*’s teachings:\n\n*The Laozi* says:\n*\"Take the body as the realm,*\n*take essence-qi as the people,*\n*and all spirits as the myriad households.\"*\n\nTang Chun explains:\n*\"Essence nourishes the form,*\n*qi nourishes the spirit—*\n*essence, qi, and spirit are the means to cultivate vigor.*\n*Mastering essence to refine the form is called* **Rich Realm**,\n*preserving spirit and safeguarding qi is called* **Peaceful People**;\n*The Sage’s outward analogy of the family and state*\n*is merely a metaphor—*\n*within one’s own body,*\n*refining essence-qi to cultivate the Great Dao/Way.*\n\nThe **Lao Mother** teaches:\n*\"Sweet wine and delicacies*\n*are the axes and spears that destroy one’s nature;*\n*lewd sounds and beautiful colors*\n*are the chisels and saws that shatter one’s bones.*\n*One unknowingly ruins one’s body,*\n*thus the people scatter and the realm collapses.\"*\n\n**Rich Realm and Peaceful People** refers to\n*the practice of teaching the methods of refinement.*\n*Chapter* here means *illumination.*\n\n**Heaven and Earth, the thieves of all things;**\n**All things, the thieves of humanity;**\n**Humanity, the thieves of all things.**\n\n*Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things*\n*because all things steal Heaven and Earth’s qi to sustain their forms.*\n*All things are thieves of humanity*\n*because humanity steals from all things to nourish its life and vitality,*\n*thus establishing the body and sustaining the form.*\n*Humanity is the thief of all things*\n*because it fails to discern the nature and inclinations of all things,*\n*only to be repaid by all things stealing from humanity in return.*\n\n*For all things’ nature and inclinations*\n*are the methods of refining grains.*\n*What one consumes should not be overindulged.*\n*Refining grains’ method:*\n*Five days of abstinence,*\n*then internally directing the fire to refine the grains,*\n*as if plucking at the nine orifices—*\n*eyes like honeycombs,*\n*employing the method of smooth refining to purge waste through the bowels,*\n*the great sun like white plaster solidifying.*\n\n*The method for urination:*\n*After forty-nine days, one may expel cinnabar through the urine.*\n*Thus it is said:*\n*\"Heaven and Earth are stolen by all things,*\n*all things are stolen by humanity,*\n*and humanity is stolen by all things.*\n*With these three thefts,*\n*one cannot escape the cycle.\"*\n\n*If humanity can seize all things’ essence-qi,*\n*refine and transform it through grain cultivation,*\n*making the intestines and stomach as supple as butter,*\n*and harness the original qi to break free from grains,*\n*then one escapes all things—*\n*but this is not the way of absolute fasting.*\n\nThe **Lao Mother** teaches:\n*\"Heaven and Earth steal from all things,*\n*stealing their vitality so that they cannot always flourish*\n*but must decline and decay;*\n*all things steal from humanity,*\n*so that humanity cannot always remain youthful*\n*but must age and die;*\n*humanity steals from all things,*\n*so that humanity cannot always endure.*\n\n*With these three thefts,*\n*none realize the mutual stealing of essence-qi,*\n*only that their forms are taken.*\n*If one neglects this daily,*\n*hunger, cold, illness, and disease will arise.*\n\n*But if one practices diligently,*\n*the Great Harmony overflows,*\n*fragrant vitality thrives,*\n*all hundred channels are nourished,*\n*and the three passages flow smoothly.*\n\n*Thus, if one fails to properly counter the thieves,*\n*one will be repaid by all things’ theft.*\n*If one can instead master the theft of form,*\n*plunder essence,*\n*refine qi,*\n*and preserve limitless life,*\n*then the three thefts are balanced,*\n*and the Three Talents are at peace.*\n\n*Heaven and Earth steal from all things,*\n*all things steal from humanity,*\n*and humanity steals from all things—*\n*all must be in harmony,*\n*without excess.*\n\n*If one loses this Dao/Way,*\n*one must first be cut down.*\n*Thus it is said:*\n*\"Eat according to the times,*\n*and the hundred limbs will be in order;*\n*stir the mechanism,*\n*and all transformations will be at peace.\"*\n\n*\"Eat according to the times, and the hundred limbs will be in order\"*\n*means that drinking and eating in accordance with the times*\n*allows the hundred channels to settle naturally;*\n*but if one eats out of season,*\n*the five viscera will not harmonize,*\n*the spirit will suffer,*\n*and the hundred limbs will be disordered.*\n\n*\"Stir the mechanism, and all transformations will be at peace\"*\n*refers to the movement of Heaven’s mechanism.*\n\nThe **Master Lü** says:\n*\"Heaven’s mechanism is profound and distant—*\n*to begin refining it is still too slow.*\n*Heaven’s mechanism is*\n*the region one inch and three fen below the navel,*\n*where the Sage first cultivates*\n*the embryo of immortality.\"*\n\nYang’s commentary on the *Difficult Classic* states:\n*\"The movement of qi between the navel and kidneys*\n*is the* **elixir field** (*dantian*),\n*the root of life and vitality.*\n*Cultivators contemplate the spirit,*\n*Buddhist monks sit in meditation—*\n*all gather true qi below the navel,*\n*and this is why.\"*\n\n*The elixir field contains a divine tortoise;*\n*when inhaling and exhaling true qi,*\n*it is not done through the mouth and nose.*\n*The mouth and nose are*\n*the gateways for qi’s entry and exit,*\n*while the elixir field is*\n*the source of qi,*\n*where the Sage begins cultivation,*\n*the dwelling place of the True One.*\n\n*Thus it is said:*\n*\"Fetal breathing is* **qi** (*qì*) *itself.\"*\n\n*\"Stir the mechanism\"*\n*refers to the* **heart-mind** (*xīn*).\n\nThe **Master Shi** says:\n*\"The heart-mind governs* **qi**,\n*and the spirit cultivates the embryo,*\n*thus all transformations are at peace.\"*\n\nThe **Lao Mother** teaches:\n*\"Eating is not about gluttony,*\n*but about stealing all things’ essence-qi.*\n*Indeed, the form can consume flavors,*\n*and the spirit can consume qi.*\n*If one eats at the proper times,*\n*the form will move,*\n*and the mechanism will refine essence,*\n*then all transformations will be at peace.\"*\n\n*Humanity knows its spirit*\n*but not the means by which it is spirit.*\n*Humanity knows the spirits of yin and yang*\n*in fortune and misfortune,*\n*but not the spirits of entry and exit within one’s own body,*\n*which determine life and death.*\n\n*Humanity knows the spirits of*\n*raising and lowering the hands and feet,*\n*but not the supreme spirit of Heaven’s mechanism,*\n*which moves and directs all things—*\n*thus it is called* **spirit within spirit**.\n\n*Humanity knows the qi entering and exiting through*\n*the mouth and nose,*\n*but not the True One’s qi within the elixir field—*\n*thus it is called* **qi within qi**.\n\n*Humanity knows the essence of the five grains,*\n*but not the True One’s original essence—*\n*thus it is called* **essence within essence**.\n\nThe **Lao Master** says:\n*\"Within essence is essence,*\n*within qi is qi,*\n*within spirit is spirit—*\n*this is my Dao/Way of Nature.\"*\n\nThe **Lao Mother** teaches:\n*\"Humanity knows the spirits of sacrifices,*\n*but not the thirty-six thousand pathways of essence, light, and spirit*\n*within one’s own body,*\n*which can become the spirits of transcendence.*\n\n*The sun and moon have their cycles,*\n*the great and small have their fixed measures.*\n*From the Sage’s accomplishments,*\n*spirit and brilliance emerge.*\n\n*The numbers of Heaven and Earth are fifty-five,*\n*The Great Unfolding’s numbers are fifty,*\n*and its applications are forty-nine.*\n*The numbers of the Five Phases are:*\n*water one,*\n*fire two,*\n*wood three,*\n*metal four,*\n*earth five—*\n*these are the numbers of life.»\n\nWithin essence, there are also **completion numbers**: water six, fire seven, wood eight, metal nine, and earth ten.\n\nNumbers refer to the **thirty radiations** of the *One Qi* (三十辐也).\nThe **thirty radiations** of the *One Qi* are:\nwater one, fire two, wood three, metal four,\nand the combined total of metal, wood, water, and fire is ten.\nEarth has no fixed form—\nit thrives according to the seasons,\nand in each of the four directions, it holds five numbers.\nFour fives make twenty,\nthen add the ten numbers,\ntotaling thirty radiations—\nthis is the use of one month.\n\nThus, in its movement,\nHeaven and Earth generate the numbers of humanity’s *qi*,\nand this is the monthly application of numbers.\n\nThe **solar numbers** are the *nine-nine* numbers,\nwhereby one begins counting from the winter solstice,\nadding one each day until reaching eighty-one days—\nthis is the number of the **Great Sun** (太阳).\nFive days make one **watch** (侯),\nfifteen days make one *qi* (气),\nforty-five days make one **node** (节),\nand ninety days make one season.\nThe moon has waxing and waning,\nand all things have their fixed allotments—\nthus, all calendars, great and small, have their allotted measures,\nand from the Sage’s accomplishments,\nspirit and brilliance emerge.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao,\nif they follow the numbers of the sun and moon,\nextracting and supplementing as needed,\nand apply them with skill—\nthe path of death grows near,\nwhile the way of life is abandoned.\nFor those who refine their mortal form into true essence,\nboth spirit and form become wondrous—\nwould they not become **Immortal Adepts**?\n\nAs for **stealing the Mysteries** (盗机),\nnone under Heaven can see or know it.\nHeaven and Earth, all things,\nsequentially **steal** from one another—\nnone can see it,\nfor they **steal the Mysteries of Heaven and Earth**.\n\nNone under Heaven can see it,\nbecause it is **colorless** (无色),\nsilent to the ear (无声),\nformless to the touch (无形),\nand nameless when called (无名).\nThus, none under Heaven can see or know it.\nThey exhaust the **creation of the *One Qi*** (一炁之造化),\nand observe the **emergence of all things** (万物之发生)—\nthus, none can know it.\n\nThe *Book of Transformation* (《化书》) states:\n*\"Gazing upward at the vast expanse, one sees no trace,*\n*dwelling in the void, one hears no sound.*\n*Yet spirit and brilliance are not distant—*\n*the virtuous person steadies their heart.\"*\n\n**Yanzi** says:\n*\"Gazing upward, it grows ever higher,*\n*delving deeper, it grows ever firmer,*\n*looking forward, it is there,*\n*yet suddenly, it is behind.*\n*Its clarity is indistinct and formless—*\n*how can it be grasped in shape?\"*\n\n**Zun** says:\n*\"Indistinct and formless* (恍惚) *are the source of having and not having.*\nThus, the Sage comprehends the **origin of having and not having** (有无之源),\nexhausts the **limit of creation** (造化之端)—\ncultivate it, and form and shape emerge.\nThus, it is said:\nnone can know it,\nnone can see it.\n\nThe **virtuous person**, if they attain it, will endure;\nthe **petty person**, if they attain it, will perish.\nBoth the virtuous and petty adjust their **nature and fate** (性命).\nThe **virtuous person**, attaining their **nature and fate**, will endure—\nbut if their **nature and fate** should suddenly vanish,\nthey must **awaken to their true nature** (悟其性),\n**nourish their life** (养其命),\nand thus prolong their years—\nthen they will achieve **long life**.\n\nThe **petty person**, attaining their **nature and fate** but unable to preserve it,\nwill lose their **life** and **nature**,\nindulging in wine and licentiousness,\ntheir wills fierce yet unsteady—\nthey do not **consolidate their nature and fate**,\nthus it is said:\nthey **lightly abandon their fate**.\n\nThe *I Ching* says:\n*\"The virtuous person aligns with Heaven and Earth in **virtue/power** (德),\nwith the sun and moon in **brilliance** (明),\nwith the four seasons in **order** (序),\nand with spirits and ghosts in **auspiciousness and inauspiciousness** (吉凶).\"*\n\nThe **virtuous person** cultivates **yinyang virtue/power** (阴德) externally,\nrefines **heart and spirit** (心神) internally,\n**consolidates endurance and nourishes life** (固穷养命),\nto safeguard their **nature and fate**—\nthis is the **virtuous person**.\n\nAs for the **petty person**,\ntheir actions and movements\ndo not accord with yinyang, sun, and moon,\nthey disregard **nature and fate**, **royal law** (王法),\nand yet boast, *\"I am strong!\"*\nThey obscure the **Dao of the spirits** (神道) in darkness,\npossess no **true essence** (寸真) within,\nand act without **benevolence** (仁) outside.\nThey harbor **thorns and brambles** (荆棘),\nand Heaven and Earth do not tolerate them.\nThe **Yin Officials** (阴公) **strip their merit** (夺功) and **divert their calculations** (夺算),\nthough they live long, their **calamity falls upon their descendants**.\nThus, it is said:\nthe **petty person** acts recklessly—\nthus, they **lightly abandon their fate**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Martial Arts of the Strong and the Victorious** (强兵战胜演术章下)\n\nTo speak of **martial strength and victory** (强兵战胜),\nis it not easy for a hundred thousand to defeat ten thousand,\nor for ten to overpower one?\nThe **virtuous person** contemplates it carefully—\nit is not the **art of war**.\n\n**Yuan Shuzhen**, the True Person, says:\n*\"To wield martial strength and achieve victory,\none must enter battle with **heroic vigor** (雄豪).\nIf **Huang Gong**’s *Three Strategies* (《三略》),\n**Lu Wang**’s *Six Canons* (《六韬》),\nand **Sunzi**’s *Thirteen Chapters* (《十三篇》)\nare applied—\nto defeat the many with the few,\nthe strong with the weak,\nand the few with the many—\nturning defeat into victory,\nthis is the **three martial arts** (三兵法).\nIs it not the case of many against few?\"*\n\n**Zun** says:\nThe Sage likens cultivation to the **art of war**,\nto **pacify chaos** (治乱).\nThe **direct pointing at the *One Heart*** (直指一心) likens **contending for victory** (争胜).\nIf the **heart** remains undisturbed,\na hundred evils find no entry.\nIf **nature** is turbid,\n*qi* becomes disordered,\nand the **path of life** grows distant.\n\nIf the **heart** is tranquil,\nthe **Dao** arises,\nand **Immortal Adepts** come naturally.\n\n**Li Chong** says:\n**Martial strength** (强兵) is the **Great Dao of Heavenly Mastery** (大道天师),\nthe **Sovereign of All Transformations** (万化之主),\nthe **descending sword-qi of demons** (降魔剑气).\nIf one attains this Dao,\n**greed, wrath, delusion, and poison** (贪嗔痴毒),\nthe **six thieves** (六贼) without **enlightenment** (无明),\n**spirits and ghosts** (神鬼) without **auspiciousness** (不祥),\nand **demonic illusions and Yin Demons** (妖伪阴魔) all collapse in unison—\nonly the **Supreme Venerable** (至尊) remains visible.\n\nThis is the **mysterious Dao of the Ancient Sage** (太古玄道),\ncalled **martial strength**.\n\nThe **Ancient Sage’s intent** (古圣之立法) was to **subdue demons and pacify chaos** (降魔治乱),\nto **teach and transform** (教化) the world in **tranquility** (清静).\nHow could it be the **Dao of sharp weapons and martial strength** (锐武强兵),\nof **chaotic campaigns and the slaughter of life** (乱役生灵),\nof **killing and harming nature and fate** (杀害性命),\nof **inviting retribution and accumulating karmic debts** (招冤引业),\nand of **bringing calamity upon descendants** (祸累子孙)?\nThe chapter speaks of **Sun Wu and Han Bai** (孙吴韩白),\nall of whom mastered the **art of martial strength and victory** (强兵战胜之术).\nAs for the **laws of attack and warfare** (攻战之法),\n**martial strength and Yin stratagems** (兵强阴谋) are deceitful—\nthey **sacrifice life to extinguish life** (以命煞命),\nand the **actions of spirits and ghosts** (神鬼之行)\ndo not truly grasp the **intent of the *Yinfu*** (《阴符》).\n\nThe **Ancient Sage’s true intent** (古圣人旨趣) is this:\n**Nourishing and consolidating** (摄养) are the **martial arts of strength and victory**.\n\nThe **blind excel in hearing**,\nthe **deaf excel in sight**—\n**severing the single source of profit** (绝利一源),\nthey **employ tenfold the troops** (用师十倍);\n**threefold reversals of day and night** (三反昼夜),\nthey **employ ten-thousandfold the troops** (用师万倍).\nThe **blind excel in hearing**,\nthe **deaf excel in sight**—\n**Zun** says:\n*\"They are fixated on **sounds and colors** (声色).\"*\nIf **sounds and colors** are forgotten,\nthe **single source of profit** is severed—\ncultivation is enhanced tenfold,\nand **consolidating and nourishing** (运养) to preserve **true nature** (固性)\nallows one to **attain singular focus**.\n\nAs for **spirit and brilliance** (精神) employing troops,\nthey are the **martial arts**.\n\nAgain, **troops** are **martial arts**,\nthey are the **many**—\nthus, this reasoning is **logically flawed** (文理可否),\nand the **words do not align with the Dao** (言不合道).\"\n\nLi Chong said:\n**\"Troops\" is not a term for martial arts.** The Great Dao is true, one, and supreme. The most august Emperor Yuan Shi, the sovereign of all beings, taught the Dao through scriptures and names—turning away from external forms and focusing inward—thus employing tenfold the troops. **Threefold reversals** occur in day and night, employing ten-thousandfold the troops.\n\nZhun said: **\"Threefold reversals\"** refer to *shen-qi-jing* (spirit-qi-essence). When *shen* returns to *qi*, the heart commands the spirit, and the spirit commands the heart. When *qi* returns to *jing*, it is the essence-fire; fire descends below, and water ascends to surge. Having reached *ji* (completion), the reverse occurs—when applied, it surpasses limits.\n\nThe **Tail Gate** (尾闾) connects the brain’s posterior, the spinal column, and the kidney meridian, ascending through *jiā jǐ* (夹脊), *shuāng guān* (双关), *fēng fǔ* (风府), *ní wán* (泥丸), and the *bǎi huì* (百会) acupoint, then flowing through the *míng táng* (明堂), *dòng fáng* (洞房), and nasal ridge, entering the *dān tiān* (丹田). It then returns through the **Divine Perilous Gate** (神巍), flowing endlessly—blood transforming into marrow. This is where the **immortal’s method** directs *jing-qi* into the *ní wán*—thus employing ten-thousandfold the troops.\n\nThe **Adrift-and-Soaring Master** said:\n*\"Each full cycle lifted, paired with the immortals as companions.\"*\n\nThe **Bright Master** said:\n*\"If one masters the nine *ní* (泥) orifices, why bother refining the Great Elixir?\"*\n\nIt is further said:\n*\"From *jiā jǐ* (夹脊) and *shuāng guān* (双关) to the crown, this is the path of cultivation’s root.\"*\n\nThe *Sutra of Upper Birth* states:\n*\"Its water surging upward, drifting between the beams and rafters—this is it.\"*\n\nThe heart arises from things and perishes in them; its mechanism lies in the eyes.\n**The mechanism lies in the eyes**—Yuan Shu’s True Person said:\n*\"The heart is the source of desire; the eyes are the root of color. The eyes govern seeing; the heart governs knowing. If the heart does not know, the eyes cannot discern—thus the saying.\"*\n\nZhun said:\n*\"When the eyes see one thing, without cause they move.\nWhen the heart fixates on one thing, it follows without restraint.\nThe true heart does not wither; the vital organism falls ill.\nDispersing the true essence—this is not perishing in things.\"*\n\n**The mechanism lies in the eyes**—if the eyes are flawed, black and white are indistinct, and the divine light is dimmed, such a person has death but no life. **To perish in things** is to be one who attains the Dao. If the eyes govern seeing while the heart remains unmoved, and *shen-qi* circulates without *jing* leaking, such a person has life but no death. **The mechanism lies in the eyes**—if black and white are clearly distinguished, the essence is untainted, and the divine light shines naturally—this is the mechanism of the eyes.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Living mercury nourishes the dead; dead mercury nourishes the living.\"*\n**Mercury** in humans governs the essence.\n\nThe *Medical Texts* state:\n*\"The heart weighs twelve *liǎng*; its stored essence is three *hé*.\"*\n\nThus, the vital organism resides in the heart. If the essence dies and mercury dries, the scriptures say *perishing in things*. Hence:\n*\"Dead mercury nourishes the living*—this is the True Person;\n*Living mercury nourishes the dead*—the cultivator’s essence and *qi* cannot congeal, and mercury cannot dry—this is the dead.\"*\n\nThus, living mercury means the person dies.\n\nAll who refine for immortality are human. Heaven, though without favor, gives birth to great benevolence. Heaven does not originally bestow grace, yet at the appointed time, it moves—true *qi* ascends and surges, and all things arise. All things receive Heaven’s great grace and endure.\n\nSwift thunder and fierce winds move all things sluggishly. Yin and yang release, and Heaven and Earth’s *qi* exchange; the utmost essence acts naturally, producing sound, and all things move sluggishly to life.\n\nHuman cultivation is no different: at the *zi-wu* hours, yin and yang coalesce to form essence. *Kàn-lǐ* (坎离) *qi* exchanges; water and fire are completed—naturally producing sound, like swift thunder and fierce winds. The utmost essence releases and makes its sound; yin dissipates, yang purifies, and one soars through the cloudy heavens—is this not immortality?\n\nAll taking and using align with yin and yang; all are the work of the utmost essence.\n\nThe **Venerable Mother** said:\n*\"When humans refine yin-yang *qi* in a misty haze, like wind in motion, like thunder’s voice, they flow harmoniously, purifying and removing impurities, generating fluids for the five viscera, and harmonizing the hundred bones. Thus, the Dao of True One is preserved.\"*\n\n**Supreme joy leaves no residue**; supreme stillness is **uprightness**.\n**Supreme joy leaves no residue**—this is joy in Heaven’s Dao.\nStillness is returning to the root.\nThus, it is said: *\"Stillness is uprightness—the Dao.\"*\nJoy is Heaven’s nature, extending to life.\nThe **Venerable Mother** said:\n*\"Seeking nothing externally, doubting nothing internally—this is the Dao of supreme joy.\"*\nSupreme joy is the utmost joy; innate nature leaves no residue. Common nature attains true stillness—this is having residue.\n\nCommon people take delight in the joy of descendants and entertainment—this is not the sage’s joy.\n\nNeither mountains are inherently still, nor markets inherently noisy. The sage, awakening to nature, takes nourishing life as stillness; attaining the One is uprightness.\n\n*The Book of Kang Cang* says:\n*\"Nobility brings verbal harmony; wealth brings bodily harmony; poverty brings mental harmony; stillness brings spiritual harmony—these are the four harmonies.\"*\n\nHeaven’s utmost privacy is used with utmost publicness.\nHeaven’s subtle formation of all things hides mechanisms within.\nThus, it is said: *\"Utmost privacy used with utmost publicness\"*—generating all classes, each attaining its Dao—this is called utmost fairness, using fairness to govern all things.\n\n**The nature of birds lies in *qi*.**\nThe sage likens soaring birds to feathered immortals—birds ride the *qi* to ascend to the azure heavens; humans cannot match this.\n\nThough humans are the most intelligent of all things, they cannot subdue the *qi* of virtue and morality. Thus, they cultivate in poverty to nourish life. If one skillfully uses the *qi* of virtue and morality, like a dragon shedding its bones, a serpent sloughing its skin, or a cicada casting its shell, humans refine and transform, entering the Great Luo, ascending to the celestial river—is this not difficult?\n\nEven at the ninth heaven above, all are those who have entered sainthood from the mundane.\n\n*The Sacred Words of the Jade Emperor* say:\n*\"Thus, the high officials of the nine heavens, the True Lords of Destiny, embrace pure essence and obtain the *hun yuan* (混元) *qi*—only then can they transcend the mundane and enter sainthood.\"*\n\nThe cultivator, if refining the *hun yuan* *qi* into pure essence, fully becoming an extreme-yang body, becomes an immortal—how could this be difficult?\n\nThe mundane and the learned alike—if they do not see what they study—are like standing beyond a mountain of ten thousand *li*, great or small, the same.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of the sages lies in subduing the source of **virtue/power** and seizing the creative function of Heaven and Earth.\n\nSuppose water reaches the winter cold and congeals into ice—this is not the extreme of cold, but it meets the **shuò fēng** (朔风) and then congeals.\n**Shuò fēng** (朔风) is the **north wind**.\n\nIn the summer months, it does not fear the heat, but fears the **south wind** that can dissolve its ice, later returning it to water.\nThus, the true essence of humanity, when congealed into **elixir**, relies on the **north wind**—the **qi** of the kidneys.\n\nWhen the essence congeals into **elixir**, it must transform into the **true unity** (真一) essence.\nThe **south wind**—the **heart fire**—converts essence into **qi**, suffusing the Four Great Elements (四大), with pure yang flowing forth, and humanity knows no death or life.\n\n**Lǎo Mǔ** (老母) says:\n*\"Even winged creatures that traverse the void of Dao/Way rely on their **qi**—how much more so for humans, the most refined of all beings! Those who cultivate and refine themselves can become entirely pure yang in form, their **qi** then able to penetrate metals and stones without obstruction, to move with the sun and moon without trace—how could they not transform their form and attain **fruit** (证果), ride the **qi** and wander the **mystic** (玄)?\"*\n\nLife is the root of death;\nDeath is the root of life.\n\nThe heart clings to fame and profit, lavishly nourishing one’s family;\nIt indulges in lust and desire for color, hoarding wealth and goods—\nOthers see this as the **Dao/Way of life**,\nI see it as the root of death.\n\nDeath is also the root of life.\nIf one does not covet what is not profit,\nKnowing one’s proper measure and what is fitting,\nHonors and decay await one’s destiny,\nGuarding the mind with single resolve,\nEver holding to the conduct of the **gentleman** (君子),\nSkilled in peril and salvation,\nNot harming the life of any being,\nMastering oneself and dwelling in **ren** (仁),\nAccumulating essence and preserving spirit—\nThen death is the root of life.\n\nLife is the root of death.\nWhen the root of death dies, life arises;\nLife and death depend on the root.\nThe **root** is the heart and the kidneys.\nThe heart’s life is death,\nThe heart’s death is life.\nThe heart is the root of the **spirit** (神),\nThe kidneys are the root of the **qi**—\nThe heart’s death brings stillness to nature,\nThe kidneys’ death preserves the vital breath;\nThe heart’s activity breeds nature’s greed,\nThe kidneys’ activity causes essence to leak.\nThus, the key lies in firmly guarding the root—\nOnly then can one attain **long life** and **enduring vision**.\n\n**Virtue/power** arises from harm,\nHarm arises from **virtue/power**.\n\nHeaven and Earth, through the **yin** and **yang** **qi**, give **virtue/power** and harm to all beings,\nYet all beings, in their emotions and nature, **steal** (反盗) Heaven and Earth’s **qi**—\nHence it is said: **virtue/power** arises from harm.\n\nHeaven bestows both **virtue/power** and harm—\nAutumn’s killing and spring’s birthing—\nHence it is said: harm arises from **virtue/power**.\n\nGreat and small alike, no distinction between inner and outer.\nThe **Dao/Way** is the origin of both **virtue/power** and harm.\nCultivate it, and life will be prolonged;\nNeglect it, and life will be shortened.\n\nThe foolish see Heaven and Earth’s patterns as superior—\nI see the patterns of time and things as profound.\n\nThe foolish see Heaven and Earth’s patterns as superior—\nAll observe the stars and constellations,\nUsing their patterns to discern auspiciousness and inauspiciousness,\nCalamity and fortune, survival and loss—\nHence they are called patterns.\n\nThe sages know nothing of their own life and death—\nThese are the foolish.\n\nI see the patterns of time and things as profound—\nFor I observe a single thing and know its flourishing and decline,\nSee a single thing and grasp its life and death,\nAll in the power of discernment.\nMy life is in my own hands—\nI reverse my gaze upon a single thing and perceive the Great **Dao/Way**,\nExamine a single thing and discern auspiciousness and inauspiciousness—\nThus life and death are in my grasp.\nMy life is in my own hands—\nI return to youth from age,\nArise from death to life—\nHence I see the patterns of time and things as profound.\"\n\n**Chún** (淳) says:\n*\"I have briefly expounded this **sutra** (经) through its minor details,\nYet I do not establish rigid chapters or phrases—\nI merely clarify its meaning and illuminate its words.\"*\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor’s** *Obscure **Yin** **Sutra*** (阴符经) concludes here.",

Two volumes. Source text:* **Zhengtong Daozang (正统道藏)***, Treasure of the Cavern of Perfection (洞真部), Jade Precepts (玉诀类).*\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s* **Yin Fu Jing** *\n\nOnly those who penetrate the profound mysteries of the heavens can elucidate the subtleties of the **Dao/Way**. How could one who has not yet attained the realm of the sages interpret the sages’ scriptures?\n\nWhy so? The sages’ words are vast as the heavens—how could those who do not delve into enigmas and unravel hidden meanings ever grasp them?\n\nTake, for instance, the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing*—its chapters are but one or two, its text scarcely three hundred words. Though concise in expression, its meaning is profound and distant; though simple in form, its intent is boundless and intricate.\n\nSome may take it as a method for enriching the state and securing the people, others as a strategy for strengthening armies and achieving victory. It encompasses all of heaven and earth, synthesizes the principles of **yin and yang**, yet appears without form or sound—so subtle that one can intuitively perceive its essence, yet so elusive that its depths cannot be fully plumbed.\n\nUnless one’s inner and outer self is clear and unobstructed, one’s surface and depths polished and refined, unless one can grasp the **Dao/Way** of heaven and earth and command the interplay of **yin and yang**, who could first dissect and then annotate it?\n\nYet many have commented on this text, but only Master Tang has truly captured the sages’ subtle intent.\n\nMaster Tang’s given name was **Chun (淳)**, and he styled himself the **Jinling Daoist (金陵道人)**. His origins remain unknown.\n\nThus, he expounded what he had heard, aligned with the sages’ intent, and supplemented with references from other works to verify it. For those who come after, when they read the original text, they may find its profundity and remoteness daunting—but when they consult his commentary, they will discover its clarity and accessibility.\n\nEach word he elucidates is like a lamp dispelling darkness; each phrase he interprets is like a tortoise shell divining doubt.\n\nHad Master Tang not inherently known the source of all existence, had he not deeply explored the origins of **creation/transformation (造化)**, had he not penetrated the **Dao/Way’s** mysteries and entered the sages’ realm, how could he have achieved this?\n\nIn recent times, **Yingran Zi (莹然子)**—a disciple of **Zhou Zhiming (周至明)**—has emerged, a scholar of our age. Inspired by the Yellow Emperor’s legends while visiting the **Kongtong Mountains (崆峒)**, he was moved by a desire to preserve and refine the **Dao/Way**, and thus sought this annotated text to engrave and print it.\n\nMay practitioners of the **Dao/Way** thereby discern the true from the false, attain sainthood while remaining in the mortal realm, hold **yin and yang** in their palms, and encompass the sun and moon within their chests—truly embodying the sages’ original purpose.\n\nHe requested I write a preface, and though I wished to decline, I feared the sin of not praising a worthy friend.\n\nThus, I took up my brush and composed this, merely to honor Master Tang’s noble endeavor.\n\nWritten in the **Jingyi (己丑)** year of **Zhengda (正大)**, at **Huoze (濩泽)**, by **Meng Shao (孟绰)**.\n\n**Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s* **Yin Fu Jing** *, Volume One*\n*Annotated by Jinling Daoist Tang Chun (金陵道人 唐淳注)*",

      "translated_text": "「The *Bao Yi* Chapter on the Dao/Way of the Immortals and Divine Ones\nThe divine, when in the eyes, is vision;\nwhen in the ears, is hearing;\nwhen in the tongue, is speech;\nwhen in the nose, perceives fragrance;\nwhen in the hands, manifests as clenched fists;\nwhen in the feet, becomes movement.\n\nBy day, it takes form as thought;\nby night, as dreams.\nWhen summoned, it comes;\nwhen dismissed, it departs.\nIn the mind, it is will;\nin speech, it is eloquence.\n\nBetween formlessness, it gathers and scatters without trace.\nWithin, it becomes emotional states;\nwithout, it dissolves into emptiness.\nWhen scattered, it permeates the cosmos and the Nine Barbarians—nowhere is untouched.\nWhen concealed, it enters even minute dust particles and sesame seeds.\n\nIt resides in the **elixir field (Dan Tian)**, and when cultivated, one becomes an immortal.\n\nIf one is dull and confused, the excess becomes a lower ghost.\nScattered, it is the mind;\ngathered, it is the **qi**.\nWhen **qi** moves, the divine moves;\nwhen **qi** gathers, the divine gathers.\n\nThe *Yijing (I Ching)* says: *\"The unfathomable interplay of yin and yang is called the divine.\"*\n\nIt further states: *\"The divine dwells in the elixir field; the **qi** condenses into an embryo.\"*\nTrue **qi** does not disperse,\nthe divine and luminous naturally arise.\nThus, the divine and **qi** mutually uphold one another—\nis this not the Dao/Way of longevity?\n\nThe divine is the child of **qi**,\n**qi** is the mother of the divine.\nThe *Dao De Jing (Laozi’s Classic of the Dao)* says: *\"Knowing its child, yet preserving its mother.\"*\n\nTang Chun says: *\"The mutual preservation of child and mother is the Dao/Way of the immortals.\"*\n\nMaster Shi Zhenren says: *\"If divine and **qi** do not disperse,\none is naturally a longevity cultivator.\"*\n\nThe term *immortal (xian)* means *transcendence*.\nCommon folk call those who attain the Dao/Way *immortals*,\nwhere the character *xian* (仙) is *ren* (人) beside *shan* (山, mountain).\nWhen common folk refine themselves,\ntheir nature is like mountains and rivers—\ntheir divine **qi** undisturbed and unshaken,\nthus, *ren* beside *shan* also.\n\nThe terms *immortals and divine ones (shenxian)* are titles for those who have attained the Dao/Way.\nJust as people call others *郎 (lang)*—\na term for those with wealth and status—\n*immortals* refers to those who have cultivated the Dao/Way and embraced the treasures within.\n\n*Bao* (抱) means *to embrace and conceal*.\n*Yi* (一) signifies the *Dao/Way*.\nThus, the chapter *\"Bao Yi\"* is indeed the beginning of the exposition on the Dao/Way.\n\nTo observe the Dao/Way of Heaven,\nand to grasp Heaven’s operations—\nthat is all.\n\n*Observe (guan)* means *to contemplate*,\nwith the upper tone as *guan* (官, official) and the lower as *guan* (贯, pierce).\nTo look upward is to observe;\nto look downward is to observe.\n*Observe* refers to the contemplation of the Six Gates.\n\nThe Buddhist school says: *\"To internalize the external forms and return them to the mind is called contemplation (guanxiang).\"*\nThus, it is called the *locking of the Six Gates*—\nwithin, nothing escapes;\nwithout, nothing enters—\nthis is the method of *guanxing*.\n\nTo look upward is to observe;\n*Observe* means *to perceive*.\nTo perceive the Dao/Way of Heaven,\nthe **North Dipper (Bei Dou)** aligns directly below,\nthe **True One of the Supreme Unity (Tai Yi Zhen Jun)** is the **qi** of Heaven—\nits name is **Tai Yi** (太一).\n\nThe **Yin True One (Yin Zhen Jun)** says: *\"Tai Yi contains the true **qi**.\"*\n\nCommon texts state:\n*\"To store it is the **original essence (Yuan Jing)**;\nto apply it is **vitality (Wan Ling)**;\nto contain it is **Tai Yi**;\nto release it is **Tai Qing (太清)**.\"*\n\nWhen **Tai Yi** descends directly,\nthe **True One (Zhen Yi)** operates;\nwhen **Tai Yi** ascends directly,\nthe **North Dipper** aligns with its symbols.\n\nThe **Dipper (Dou)** is the handle;\nmerely observe the **North Dipper’s** monthly stations—\nthe Dao/Way of Heaven observed in the first month’s station,\nthe **Tiger (Yin)** in the **Tiger** month—\ncycling endlessly without cessation.\n\nOne **qi** ascends and descends,\nthe sun and moon revolve;\nthe **Five Stars** and **Six Celestial Lights (Liu Yao)**,\narranged in myriad forms—\nall operate in harmony.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Five days mark a **host (hou)**,\nfifteen days mark a **qi**,\nforty-five days mark a **node (jie)**,\nninety days mark a **season (ji)**.\"*\n\nSpring generates, summer lengthens,\nautumn harvests, winter stores.\nIt gives rise to all things—\nHeaven above, Heaven below,\npalaces of the immortals, realm of mortals,\nembryos, eggs, damp transformations—\none root, one sprout,\none branch, one leaf,\none blossom, one fruit—\nsentient and insentient alike,\nall receive the **Dao/Way’s qi** and are thereby produced.\n\nThus, all things within and without are none other than the Dao/Way itself.\nTherefore, when one perceives the Dao/Way of Heaven’s operations,\none also observes that human cultivation does not differ from Heaven’s Dao/Way.\n\nThe Dao/Way of humanity:\n**Tai Yi** resides between the two kidneys,\nwith a yellow center in the hall,\nred above and black below,\nblue-green to the left and white to the right—\nits embrace of the Five Phases,\nthe **Supreme Unity (Hun Yuan Yi)**,\nthe **True One (Zhen Yi)**,\nis called **Tai Yi**.\n\n**Tai Yi** is the sovereign name of **water**.\nThe **North Dipper’s** alignment is the **seven orifices of the heart (Xin Qi Qiao)**.\nThe sun and moon are the **heart and kidneys**.\nHumans without sun and moon,\nuse the heart and kidneys as sun and moon;\nHeaven without heart and kidneys,\nuses the sun and moon as heart and kidneys.\n\nThe **Five Stars** and **Six Celestial Lights** correspond to the **Five Zang Organs** and **Six Fu Organs**.\nThe *\"myriad forms\"* are the **36,000 divine lights** of skin, hair, bones, and joints.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says: *\"Without leaving one’s door, one knows the affairs of the world.\"*\nMaster He Shang Gong says: *\"The human body is likened to Heaven and Earth’s operations.\"*\n\nMoreover, when one aligns their own **Tai Yi** with its celestial movement,\nthe sun and moon revolve in harmony,\nand the true essence is attained.\n\nWhen the **heart’s fire** descends and the **kidney’s water** ascends,\nwater above and fire below,\nthe **Five Zang Organs** and **hundred meridians** produce **vital fluids (jin ye)**.\nThe **qi**, **vital fluids**, **blood**, and **divine lights** flow naturally,\nthe **Five Phases**, **Four Symbols**, **Eight Trigrams**, and **myriad divine essences** return to the Great Dao/Way.\nThe **hundred bones** and **nine orifices** attain **spiritual responsiveness (Tong Ling)**,\nthe hands grasp **Tai Yi**,\nand **life and vitality are secured**.\n\nIf one follows the Dao/Way of Heaven’s operations,\nwill they not live as long as Heaven and Earth?\nThus it is said: *\"To grasp Heaven’s operations—\nthat is all.\"*\n\nTherefore, the sages point to Heaven’s Dao/Way,\nand liken human cultivation to observing Heaven’s operations.\nTo grasp Heaven’s operations,\nthere is none who does not become an immortal.\n\nHeaven has **Five Thieves (Wu Ze)**;\nthose who perceive them flourish.\nTo obtain the thieves is to flourish;\nto lose them is to perish.\n\nThe **Seven Worthies (Qi Xian)** say:\n*\"The Five Stars, Five Mountains, Five Zang Organs, Five Directions, and Five Thieves—\nthese are the Five Thieves’ alignment with the Five Phases,\na treasure held by the profound scholars,\nall-encompassing in meaning.\"*\n\nTang Chun says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth employ the Five Phases,\neach alternately restraining and generating the others.\nHeaven’s Five Thieves are:\n**wood, water, metal, earth, and fire**;\nEarth’s Five Thieves are:\n**metal, wood, water, fire, and earth**.\n\nThe sages say that Heaven’s Five Thieves move in reverse,\nyin and yang inverted and returning;\nEarth’s Five Thieves follow Earth’s natural order,\nthus humans have life and death.\n\nIf one perceives Heaven’s thieves,\nand operates in accordance with them,\nthen humans have only life and no death.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Those who perceive them flourish.\"*\n\nMoreover, when observing Earth’s Five Phases,\n**metal** generates **water**—\nbut Heaven’s Five Phases are otherwise,\nfor **water** generates **metal** instead.»",

When the King of Chu went hunting, the mountain ape circled around a tree, and the king, seeing its skill, commanded Yang Youji to shoot it. Youji aimed his arrow, but the mountain ape clung to the tree and cried, knowing Youji was a master archer and that it could not escape—it would surely die.

The **Three Senses**—ears, eyes, and mouth—can perceive **evil colors**, hear **evil sounds**, and taste **evil flavors**.

The lowest rank of the lowest grades has no orifices at all in the heart; such a person is called **foolish**, no different from a brute beast.

the realm,*\n*take essence-qi as the people,*\n*and all spirits as the myriad households.\"*\n\nTang Chun explains:\n*\"Essence nourishes the form,*\n*qi nourishes the spirit—*\n*essence, qi, and spirit are the means to cultivate vigor.*\n*Mastering essence to refine the form is called* **Rich Realm**,\n*preserving spirit and safeguarding qi is called* **Peaceful People**;\n*The Sage’s outward analogy of the family and state*\n*is merely a metaphor—*\n*within one’s own body,*\n*refining essence-qi to cultivate the Great Dao/Way.*\n\nThe **Lao Mother** teaches:\n*\"Sweet wine and delicacies*\n*are the axes and spears that destroy one’s nature;*\n*lewd sounds and beautiful colors*\n*are the chisels and saws that shatter one’s bones.*\n*One unknowingly ruins one’s body,*\n*thus the people scatter and the realm collapses.\"*\n\n**Rich Realm and Peaceful People** refers to\n*the practice of teaching the methods of refinement.*\n*Chapter* here means *illumination.*\n\n**Heaven and Earth, the thieves of all things;**\n**All things, the thieves of humanity;**\n**Humanity, the thieves of all things.**\n\n*Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things*\n*because all things steal Heaven and Earth’s qi to sustain their forms.*\n*All things are thieves of humanity*\n*because humanity steals from all things to nourish its life and vitality,*\n*thus establishing the body and sustaining the form.*\n*Humanity is the thief of all things*\n*because it fails to discern the nature and inclinations of all things,*\n*only to be repaid by all things stealing from humanity in return.*\n\n*For all things’ nature and inclinations*\n*are the methods of refining grains.*\n*What one consumes should not be overindulged.*\n*Refining grains’ method:*\n*Five days of abstinence,*\n*then internally directing the fire to refine the grains,*\n*as if plucking at the nine orifices—*\n*eyes like honeycombs,*\n*employing the method of smooth refining to purge waste through the bowels,*\n*the great sun like white plaster solidifying.*\n\n*The method for urination:*\n*After forty-nine days, one may expel cinnabar through the urine.*\n*Thus it is said:*\n*\"Heaven and Earth are stolen by all things,*\n*all things are stolen by humanity,*\n*and humanity is stolen by all things.*\n*With these three thefts,*\n*one cannot escape the cycle.\"*\n\n*If humanity can seize all things’ essence-qi,*\n*refine and transform it through grain cultivation,*\n*making the intestines and stomach as supple as butter,*\n*and harness the original qi to break free from grains,*\n*then one escapes all things—*\n*but this is not the way of absolute fasting.*\n\nThe **Lao Mother** teaches:\n*\"Heaven and Earth steal from all things,*\n*stealing their vitality so that they cannot always flourish*\n*but must decline and decay;*\n*all things steal from humanity,*\n*so that humanity cannot always remain youthful*\n*but must age and die;*\n*humanity steals from all things,*\n*so that humanity cannot always endure.*\n\n*With these three thefts,*\n*none realize the mutual stealing of essence-qi,*\n*only that their forms are taken.*\n*If one neglects this daily,*\n*hunger, cold, illness, and disease will arise.*\n\n*But if one practices diligently,*\n*the Great Harmony overflows,*\n*fragrant vitality thrives,*\n*all hundred channels are nourished,*\n*and the three passages flow smoothly.*\n\n*Thus, if one fails to properly counter the thieves,*\n*one will be repaid by all things’ theft.*\n*If one can instead master the theft of form,*\n*plunder essence,*\n*refine qi,*\n*and preserve limitless life,*\n*then the three thefts are balanced,*\n*and the Three Talents are at peace.*\n\n*Heaven and Earth steal from all things,*\n*all things steal from humanity,*\n*and humanity steals from all things—*\n*all must be in harmony,*\n*without excess.*\n\n*If one loses this Dao/Way,*\n*one must first be cut down.*\n*Thus it is said:*\n*\"Eat according to the times,*\n*and the hundred limbs will be in order;*\n*stir the mechanism,*\n*and all transformations will be at peace.\"*\n\n*\"Eat according to the times, and the hundred limbs will be in order\"*\n*means that drinking and eating in accordance with the times*\n*allows the hundred channels to settle naturally;*\n*but if one eats out of season,*\n*the five viscera will not harmonize,*\n*the spirit will suffer,*\n*and the hundred limbs will be disordered.*\n\n*\"Stir the mechanism, and all transformations will be at peace\"*\n*refers to the movement of Heaven’s mechanism.*\n\nThe **Master Lü** says:\n*\"Heaven’s mechanism is profound and distant—*\n*to begin refining it is still too slow.*\n*Heaven’s mechanism is*\n*the region one inch and three fen below the navel,*\n*where the Sage first cultivates*\n*the embryo of immortality.\"*\n\nYang’s commentary on the *Difficult Classic* states:\n*\"The movement of qi between the navel and kidneys*\n*is the* **elixir field** (*dantian*),\n*the root of life and vitality.*\n*Cultivators contemplate the spirit,*\n*Buddhist monks sit in meditation—*\n*all gather true qi below the navel,*\n*and this is why.\"*\n\n*The elixir field contains a divine tortoise;*\n*when inhaling and exhaling true qi,*\n*it is not done through the mouth and nose.*\n*The mouth and nose are*\n*the gateways for qi’s entry and exit,*\n*while the elixir field is*\n*the source of qi,*\n*where the Sage begins cultivation,*\n*the dwelling place of the True One.*\n\n*Thus it is said:*\n*\"Fetal breathing is* **qi** (*qì*) *itself.\"*\n\n*\"Stir the mechanism\"*\n*refers to the* **heart-mind** (*xīn*).\n\nThe **Master Shi** says:\n*\"The heart-mind governs* **qi**,\n*and the spirit cultivates the embryo,*\n*thus all transformations are at peace.\"*\n\nThe **Lao Mother** teaches:\n*\"Eating is not about gluttony,*\n*but about stealing all things’ essence-qi.*\n*Indeed, the form can consume flavors,*\n*and the spirit can consume qi.*\n*If one eats at the proper times,*\n*the form will move,*\n*and the mechanism will refine essence,*\n*then all transformations will be at peace.\"*\n\n*Humanity knows its spirit*\n*but not the means by which it is spirit.*\n*Humanity knows the spirits of yin and yang*\n*in fortune and misfortune,*\n*but not the spirits of entry and exit within one’s own body,*\n*which determine life and death.*\n\n*Humanity knows the spirits of*\n*raising and lowering the hands and feet,*\n*but not the supreme spirit of Heaven’s mechanism,*\n*which moves and directs all things—*\n*thus it is called* **spirit within spirit**.\n\n*Humanity knows the qi entering and exiting through*\n*the mouth and nose,*\n*but not the True One’s qi within the elixir field—*\n*thus it is called* **qi within qi**.\n\n*Humanity knows the essence of the five grains,*\n*but not the True One’s original essence—*\n*thus it is called* **essence within essence**.\n\nThe **Lao Master** says:\n*\"Within essence is essence,*\n*within qi is qi,*\n*within spirit is spirit—*\n*this is my Dao/Way of Nature.\"*\n\nThe **Lao Mother** teaches:\n*\"Humanity knows the spirits of

      "translated_text": "Li Chong said:\n**\"Troops\" is not a term for martial arts.** The Great Dao is true, one, and supreme. The most august Emperor Yuan Shi, the sovereign of all beings, taught the Dao through scriptures and names—turning away from external forms and focusing inward—thus employing tenfold the troops. **Threefold reversals** occur in day and night, employing ten-thousandfold the troops.\n\nZhun said: **\"Threefold reversals\"** refer to *shen-qi-jing* (spirit-qi-essence). When *shen* returns to *qi*, the heart commands the spirit, and the spirit commands the heart. When *qi* returns to *jing*, it is the essence-fire; fire descends below, and water ascends to surge. Having reached *ji* (completion), the reverse occurs—when applied, it surpasses limits.\n\nThe **Tail Gate** (尾闾) connects the brain’s posterior, the spinal column, and the kidney meridian, ascending through *jiā jǐ* (夹脊), *shuāng guān* (双关), *fēng fǔ* (风府), *ní wán* (泥丸), and the *bǎi huì* (百会) acupoint, then flowing through the *míng táng* (明堂), *dòng fáng* (洞房), and nasal ridge, entering the *dān tiān* (丹田). It then returns through the **Divine Perilous Gate** (神巍), flowing endlessly—blood transforming into marrow. This is where the **immortal’s method** directs *jing-qi* into the *ní wán*—thus employing ten-thousandfold the troops.\n\nThe **Adrift-and-Soaring Master** said:\n*\"Each full cycle lifted, paired with the immortals as companions.\"*\n\nThe **Bright Master** said:\n*\"If one masters the nine *ní* (泥) orifices, why bother refining the Great Elixir?\"*\n\nIt is further said:\n*\"From *jiā jǐ* (夹脊) and *shuāng guān* (双关) to the crown, this is the path of cultivation’s root.\"*\n\nThe *Sutra of Upper Birth* states:\n*\"Its water surging upward, drifting between the beams and rafters—this is it.\"*\n\nThe heart arises from things and perishes in them; its mechanism lies in the eyes.\n**The mechanism lies in the eyes**—Yuan Shu’s True Person said:\n*\"The heart is the source of desire; the eyes are the root of color. The eyes govern seeing; the heart governs knowing. If the heart does not know, the eyes cannot discern—thus the saying.\"*\n\nZhun said:\n*\"When the eyes see one thing, without cause they move.\nWhen the heart fixates on one thing, it follows without restraint.\nThe true heart does not wither; the vital organism falls ill.\nDispersing the true essence—this is not perishing in things.\"*\n\n**The mechanism lies in the eyes**—if the eyes are flawed, black and white are indistinct, and the divine light is dimmed, such a person has death but no life. **To perish in things** is to be one who attains the Dao. If the eyes govern seeing while the heart remains unmoved, and *shen-qi* circulates without *jing* leaking, such a person has life but no death. **The mechanism lies in the eyes**—if black and white are clearly distinguished, the essence is untainted, and the divine light shines naturally—this is the mechanism of the eyes.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Living mercury nourishes the dead; dead mercury nourishes the living.\"*\n**Mercury** in humans governs the essence.\n\nThe *Medical Texts* state:\n*\"The heart weighs twelve *liǎng*; its stored essence is three *hé*.\"*\n\nThus, the vital organism resides in the heart. If the essence dies and mercury dries, the scriptures say *perishing in things*. Hence:\n*\"Dead mercury nourishes the living*—this is the True Person;\n*Living mercury nourishes the dead*—the cultivator’s essence and *qi* cannot congeal, and mercury cannot dry—this is the dead.\"*\n\nThus, living mercury means the person dies.\n\nAll who refine for immortality are human. Heaven, though without favor, gives birth to great benevolence. Heaven does not originally bestow grace, yet at the appointed time, it moves—true *qi* ascends and surges, and all things arise. All things receive Heaven’s great grace and endure.\n\nSwift thunder and fierce winds move all things sluggishly. Yin and yang release, and Heaven and Earth’s *qi* exchange; the utmost essence acts naturally, producing sound, and all things move sluggishly to life.\n\nHuman cultivation is no different: at the *zi-wu* hours, yin and yang coalesce to form essence. *Kàn-lǐ* (坎离) *qi* exchanges; water and fire are completed—naturally producing sound, like swift thunder and fierce winds. The utmost essence releases and makes its sound; yin dissipates, yang purifies, and one soars through the cloudy heavens—is this not immortality?\n\nAll taking and using align with yin and yang; all are the work of the utmost essence.\n\nThe **Venerable Mother** said:\n*\"When humans refine yin-yang *qi* in a misty haze, like wind in motion, like thunder’s voice, they flow harmoniously, purifying and removing impurities, generating fluids for the five viscera, and harmonizing the hundred bones. Thus, the Dao of True One is preserved.\"*\n\n**Supreme joy leaves no residue**; supreme stillness is **uprightness**.\n**Supreme joy leaves no residue**—this is joy in Heaven’s Dao.\nStillness is returning to the root.\nThus, it is said: *\"Stillness is uprightness—the Dao.\"*\nJoy is Heaven’s nature, extending to life.\nThe **Venerable Mother** said:\n*\"Seeking nothing externally, doubting nothing internally—this is the Dao of supreme joy.\"*\nSupreme joy is the utmost joy; innate nature leaves no residue. Common nature attains true stillness—this is having residue.\n\nCommon people take delight in the joy of descendants and entertainment—this is not the sage’s joy.\n\nNeither mountains are inherently still, nor markets inherently noisy. The sage, awakening to nature, takes nourishing life as stillness; attaining the One is uprightness.\n\n*The Book of Kang Cang* says:\n*\"Nobility brings verbal harmony; wealth brings bodily harmony; poverty brings mental harmony; stillness brings spiritual harmony—these are the four harmonies.\"*\n\nHeaven’s utmost privacy is used with utmost publicness.\nHeaven’s subtle formation of all things hides mechanisms within.\nThus, it is said: *\"Utmost privacy used with utmost publicness\"*—generating all classes, each attaining its Dao—this is called utmost fairness, using fairness to govern all things.\n\n**The nature of birds lies in *qi*.**\nThe sage likens soaring birds to feathered immortals—birds ride the *qi* to ascend to the azure heavens; humans cannot match this.\n\nThough humans are the most intelligent of all things, they cannot subdue the *qi* of virtue and morality. Thus, they cultivate in poverty to nourish life. If one skillfully uses the *qi* of virtue and morality, like a dragon shedding its bones, a serpent sloughing its skin, or a cicada casting its shell, humans refine and transform, entering the Great Luo, ascending to the celestial river—is this not difficult?\n\nEven at the ninth heaven above, all are those who have entered sainthood from the mundane.\n\n*The Sacred Words of the Jade Emperor* say:\n*\"Thus, the high officials of the nine heavens, the True Lords of Destiny, embrace pure essence and obtain the *hun yuan* (混元) *qi*—only then can they transcend the mundane and enter sainthood.\"*\n\nThe cultivator, if refining the *hun yuan* *qi* into pure essence, fully becoming an extreme-yang body, becomes an immortal—how could this be difficult?",

      "translated_text": "The mundane and the learned alike—if they do not see what they study—are like standing beyond a mountain of ten thousand *li*, great or small, the same.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of the sages lies in subduing the source of **virtue/power** and seizing the creative function of Heaven and Earth.\n\nSuppose water reaches the winter cold and congeals into ice—this is not the extreme of cold, but it meets the **shuò fēng** (朔风) and then congeals.\n**Shuò fēng** (朔风) is the **north wind**.\n\nIn the summer months, it does not fear the heat, but fears the **south wind** that can dissolve its ice, later returning it to water.\nThus, the true essence of humanity, when congealed into **elixir**, relies on the **north wind**—the **qi** of the kidneys.\n\nWhen the essence congeals into **elixir**, it must transform into the **true unity** (真一) essence.\nThe **south wind**—the **heart fire**—converts essence into **qi**, suffusing the Four Great Elements (四大), with pure yang flowing forth, and humanity knows no death or life.\n\n**Lǎo Mǔ** (老母) says:\n*\"Even winged creatures that traverse the void of Dao/Way rely on their **qi**—how much more so for humans, the most refined of all beings! Those who cultivate and refine themselves can become entirely pure yang in form, their **qi** then able to penetrate metals and stones without obstruction, to move with the sun and moon without trace—how could they not transform their form and attain **fruit** (证果), ride the **qi** and wander the **mystic** (玄)?\"*\n\nLife is the root of death;\nDeath is the root of life.\n\nThe heart clings to fame and profit, lavishly nourishing one’s family;\nIt indulges in lust and desire for color, hoarding wealth and goods—\nOthers see this as the **Dao/Way of life**,\nI see it as the root of death.\n\nDeath is also the root of life.\nIf one does not covet what is not profit,\nKnowing one’s proper measure and what is fitting,\nHonors and decay await one’s destiny,\nGuarding the mind with single resolve,\nEver holding to the conduct of the **gentleman** (君子),\nSkilled in peril and salvation,\nNot harming the life of any being,\nMastering oneself and dwelling in **ren** (仁),\nAccumulating essence and preserving spirit—\nThen death is the root of life.\n\nLife is the root of death.\nWhen the root of death dies, life arises;\nLife and death depend on the root.\nThe **root** is the heart and the kidneys.\nThe heart’s life is death,\nThe heart’s death is life.\nThe heart is the root of the **spirit** (神),\nThe kidneys are the root of the **qi**—\nThe heart’s death brings stillness to nature,\nThe kidneys’ death preserves the vital breath;\nThe heart’s activity breeds nature’s greed,\nThe kidneys’ activity causes essence to leak.\nThus, the key lies in firmly guarding the root—\nOnly then can one attain **long life** and **enduring vision**.\n\n**Virtue/power** arises from harm,\nHarm arises from **virtue/power**.\n\nHeaven and Earth, through the **yin** and **yang** **qi**, give **virtue/power** and harm to all beings,\nYet all beings, in their emotions and nature, **steal** (反盗) Heaven and Earth’s **qi**—\nHence it is said: **virtue/power** arises from harm.\n\nHeaven bestows both **virtue/power** and harm—\nAutumn’s killing and spring’s birthing—\nHence it is said: harm arises from **virtue/power**.\n\nGreat and small alike, no distinction between inner and outer.\nThe **Dao/Way** is the origin of both **virtue/power** and harm.\nCultivate it, and life will be prolonged;\nNeglect it, and life will be shortened.\n\nThe foolish see Heaven and Earth’s patterns as superior—\nI see the patterns of time and things as profound.\n\nThe foolish see Heaven and Earth’s patterns as superior—\nAll observe the stars and constellations,\nUsing their patterns to discern auspiciousness and inauspiciousness,\nCalamity and fortune, survival and loss—\nHence they are called patterns.\n\nThe sages know nothing of their own life and death—\nThese are the foolish.\n\nI see the patterns of time and things as profound—\nFor I observe a single thing and know its flourishing and decline,\nSee a single thing and grasp its life and death,\nAll in the power of discernment.\nMy life is in my own hands—\nI reverse my gaze upon a single thing and perceive the Great **Dao/Way**,\nExamine a single thing and discern auspiciousness and inauspiciousness—\nThus life and death are in my grasp.\nMy life is in my own hands—\nI return to youth from age,\nArise from death to life—\nHence I see the patterns of time and things as profound.\"\n\n**Chún** (淳) says:\n*\"I have briefly expounded this **sutra** (经) through its minor details,\nYet I do not establish rigid chapters or phrases—\nI merely clarify its meaning and illuminate its words.\"*\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor’s** *Obscure **Yin** **Sutra*** (阴符经) concludes here.",
