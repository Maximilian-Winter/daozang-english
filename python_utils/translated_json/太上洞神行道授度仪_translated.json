If the ritual texts are to be exposed and wind or rain arises, the transmission may be conducted indoors.\n\nFor the seat of the Heavenly Sovereign, use eighteen bolts of black silk. For the Earthly Sovereign, eighteen bolts of white silk. For the Human Sovereign, eighteen bolts of blue silk. The silk for the adept’s life-destiny shall correspond to their years: the Son of Heaven shall use bolts, nobles shall use *zhang*, and commoners shall use *chi*. The Son of Heaven shall use purple damask; others shall use plain silk, its color varying by direction, all placed upon the table of the Human Sovereign. Three golden dragons shall be used; commoners may substitute rings. Three blue silk banners, each three *chi* in length, shall be inscribed with the inner texts of the Three Sovereigns in vermilion, fashioned according to banner custom.

The disciple shall prostrate again, while the master kneels to read the covenant text. Together, they sip the cinnabar water and jointly inscribe a vermilion mark beneath the covenant. The disciple shall then hold the offering and prostrate. The master, holding the scripture and kneeling, shall strike the teeth twenty-four times, visualizing within the Three Palaces a true person each, like an infant, unclothed, their mouths emitting purple *qi* to suffuse the scripture. Slowly, the master shall recite the incantation:\n\n*\"The celestial texts of the Supreme,\nTransmitted since the dawn of heaven and earth,\nProclaimed by the Sovereigns as the profound decree,\nAre the scriptures of the utmost perfection.\nNow received by the worthy,\nWith the aspiration to ascend to the Great Void.\"*\n\nUpon completion, the disciple shall bow twice and place the offering beneath the table. The transmission of the scriptures concluded, both shall bow twice again. Then, chant the three *Yang Songs*, circling the altar once.\n\n**Yang Song of the Clear Horn**\nThe *Yang* chant, like a drifting *fàn*,\nResonates through the ten directions.\nA myriad verdant blossoms gleam,\nBearing me to the ninefold heights.\nThe western string ascends in tune,\nAwakening the Lord of the Eastern Marchmount.\nThe Primordial Cavern inaugurates the course,\nAs the first *yang* sprouts ten thousand buds.\nThe harmonious wind stirs the jade branches,\nThe lofty groves gleam with cloudy veils.\n*Gou Mang* urges the farmer’s toil,\nSun and moon illumine the eastern expanse.\nImmortal sages wander the Mystic Garden,\nSoaring *fàn* arise with the cry of pipes.\nGrasping the light within the chambers of the grand auroras,\nWe align our wheels with the nine heavens’ courts.\nThe host of immortals lifts their flying *fàn*,\nThe *Yang* song resounds in its season.\nWere one not of the spirit’s myriad,\nHow could one uphold the rites of transformation’s purity?\n\nNext, return to the Heavenly Palace, face north, bow twice, kneel, and strike the teeth thirty-six times.

Open three gates: the Gate of the Heavenly Sovereign in the *zi* (north) direction, the Gate of the Earthly Sovereign in the *shen* (southwest) direction, and the Gate of the Human Sovereign in the *yin* (northeast) direction, each marked with an inscribed placard. The size may also be adjusted according to the number of participants. Encircle the altar with railings and lamps, arranged as deemed appropriate. Entry and exit shall be made through the Gate of the Human Sovereign. If the ritual texts are to be exposed and wind or rain arises, the transmission may be conducted indoors.\n\nFor the seat of the Heavenly Sovereign, use eighteen bolts of black silk. For the Earthly Sovereign, eighteen bolts of white silk. For the Human Sovereign, eighteen bolts of blue silk. The silk for the adept’s life-destiny shall correspond to their years: the Son of Heaven shall use bolts, nobles shall use *zhang*, and commoners shall use *chi*. The Son of Heaven shall use purple damask; others shall use plain silk, its color varying by direction, all placed upon the table of the Human Sovereign. Three golden dragons shall be used; commoners may substitute rings. Three blue silk banners, each three *chi* in length, shall be inscribed with the inner texts of the Three Sovereigns in vermilion, fashioned according to banner custom. Bamboo poles, ten *chi* in length, shall suspend them at the positions of the Three Sovereigns. Three sets of tables, incense, and lamps shall be arranged to hold the dragons, silks, and other items, as well as the scriptures of the Three Sovereigns.\n\nThe aforementioned altar and its furnishings shall be employed for all rites conducted for the state and the people, for averting great disasters and severe calamities, for seeking grace and invoking blessings, for performing the Dao and transmitting the registers. The recipient of the scriptures shall offer four hundred *chi* of white silk; the poor shall offer forty *chi*. Upon completion of the ritual, master and disciple shall exit the altar, strike the teeth twenty-four times, and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Maiden of the incense smoke, ascend and report to the August Lord. The humble Daoist adept [Name], purified in fast and free of worldly dust, awaits the numinous union of the Five Perfections. May my highest aspirations be fulfilled, calamities extinguished, blessings born, and may I ascend with the Three Heavens.\"*\n\nThen, facing north, bow twice and invoke:\n*\"Primordial Void of the Three Mysteries, Celestial Stem *Jia-Zi*, Founding Heavenly Sovereign of the Supreme Flourishing Prosperity, Supreme Radiance of the Congealed Yin of the Grand Brilliance.\"*\n\nNext, facing southwest, bow twice and invoke:\n*\"Three Primordials of the Pure Void, Jade Heaven of the Celestial Stem *Jia-Shen*, Founding Earthly Sovereign of the Southern Harmony and Grand Non-Flourishing.\"*\n\nThen, facing northeast, bow twice and invoke:\n*\"Seven Subtleties of the Vast Expanse, Void Heaven of the Celestial Stem *Jia-Yin*, Founding Human Sovereign of the Supreme Non-Flourishing Prosperity of the Southern Elixir.\"*\n\nNext, unfurl the first two *chi* of the received scripture and the covenant text upon the table, and bow twice together. The disciple shall prostrate facing south, while the master kneels facing north. The humble Daoist adept [Name] respectfully addresses the Supreme Primordial Lady, the Great Divinities of the Immortal Capital, and the Three Sovereigns:\n\n*\"I now seek to transmit the precious texts of the Three Sovereigns to [Name] of [Commandery, County, Village]. I await your decree to know if this may proceed.\"*\n\nThen prostrate for a time. When the wind ceases, rise and bow twice. The disciple shall prostrate again, while the master kneels to read the covenant text. Together, they sip the cinnabar water and jointly inscribe a vermilion mark beneath the covenant. The disciple shall then hold the offering and prostrate. The master, holding the scripture and kneeling, shall strike the teeth twenty-four times, visualizing within the Three Palaces a true person each, like an infant, unclothed, their mouths emitting purple *qi* to suffuse the scripture. Slowly, the master shall recite the incantation:\n\n*\"The celestial texts of the Supreme,\nTransmitted since the dawn of heaven and earth,\nProclaimed by the Sovereigns as the profound decree,\nAre the scriptures of the utmost perfection.\nNow received by the worthy,\nWith the aspiration to ascend to the Great Void.\"*\n\nUpon completion, the disciple shall bow twice and place the offering beneath the table. The transmission of the scriptures concluded, both shall bow twice again. Then, chant the three *Yang Songs*, circling the altar once.\n\n**Yang Song of the Clear Horn**\nThe *Yang* chant, like a drifting *fàn*,\nResonates through the ten directions.\nA myriad verdant blossoms gleam,\nBearing me to the ninefold heights.\nThe western string ascends in tune,\nAwakening the Lord of the Eastern Marchmount.\nThe Primordial Cavern inaugurates the course,\nAs the first *yang* sprouts ten thousand buds.\nThe harmonious wind stirs the jade branches,\nThe lofty groves gleam with cloudy veils.\n*Gou Mang* urges the farmer’s toil,\nSun and moon illumine the eastern expanse.\nImmortal sages wander the Mystic Garden,\nSoaring *fàn* arise with the cry of pipes.\nGrasping the light within the chambers of the grand auroras,\nWe align our wheels with the nine heavens’ courts.\nThe host of immortals lifts their flying *fàn*,\nThe *Yang* song resounds in its season.\nWere one not of the spirit’s myriad,\nHow could one uphold the rites of transformation’s purity?\n\nNext, return to the Heavenly Palace, face north, bow twice, kneel, and strike the teeth thirty-six times.
