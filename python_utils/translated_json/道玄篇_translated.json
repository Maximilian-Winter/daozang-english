  "full_translation": "**Dao Xuan Section**\n\n**Title:** *Dao Xuan* (The Mysterious Dao)\n**Author:** *Yuan Wang Dao Yuan* (Master Yuan of the Daoist Way)\n**Volume:** One\n**Source:** *The Zhengheng Daozang* (Canon of the Orthodox Daoist Treasury), *Tai Xuan* (Great Mysteries) Division\n\n---\n\n**Chapter One: The Great Dao**\nThe Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, thus it can give birth to Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth encompass all things, thus they can nourish all things.\nAll things are diverse and manifold—none without the Dao.\nThe Dao is formless and void, yet it gives rise to things to establish the Dao’s own form.\nThe *xing* (form/shape) is the Dao’s dwelling, the *shen* (spirit/soul) is the Dao’s mechanism.\nAll things possess their own *Tai Ji* (Supreme Polarity), their movement and stillness in harmony with the Dao yet never departing from it.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: The Mysterious Extremes**\nThe boundless is called the Dao, the Supreme Polarity is called the *shen* (body).\nThe body contains its own body, hence it is called *tianxin* (Heavenly Heart).\nThe Heavenly Heart abides in tranquility and centrality, its spirit mechanism sovereign yet void and luminous.\nIts responses are ever pure, all transformations return to truth.\nIts spirit follows the obscured nature of things, yet all transformations arise spontaneously.\nIs it not that the Dao is distant from humanity, but rather that humanity itself distances itself from the Dao?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three: The Allocation of Fate**\nNo human is born without fate.\nNo fate is bestowed without inherent *xing* (nature).\nThis *xing* is the *shen* (spirit), this fate is the *qi* (vital breath).\nThe spirit governs the body, the *qi* sustains the body.\nThe spirit remains unlost in its guardianship, the *qi* unlost in its regulation.\nWhen spirit and *qi* merge as one, the Dao flows unobstructed and never decays.\nThus one may attain longevity and enduring vision, transcending the dust and clamor of the mundane.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four: Illuminating Principles**\nThe Dao does not stand alone, thus it gives rise to things to establish its form.\nThe Dao does not act in vain, thus it gives rise to humanity to enact its will.\nTherefore, if one can illuminate Heaven and Earth’s eternal laws,\nknow the interplay of *yin* and *yang* (polarities),\ngrasp the methods of creation and transformation,\none may hold the fundamental threads of all things.\n\nWho else but the *sheng ren* (Sage) could forge such principles?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Five: Marvelous Applications**\nHeaven and Earth are the physical manifestations of *yin* and *yang*’s polarities,\nwhile *yin* and *yang* are the transformative mechanisms of Heaven and Earth.\nThe *yang* is odd, the *yin* is even;\n*yin* is the substance, *yang* the nourishment.\nOne ascends, one descends—both never depart.\nThus all things have their pairings, each following its kind in propagation.\nHence, when the male moves and the female stirs not,\nthe harmony of Heaven and Earth may be discerned.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Six: The Nature of Humanity and Things**\nHumans receive *qi* fully, things receive *qi* partially.\nThe spirit’s unity in fate is granted to each by Heaven.\nIn humans, this nature has both good and evil;\nin things, this nature also has good and evil.\nWhy so? It is the differing *qi*’s inherent disposition,\nnot the nature’s original essence.\nThus all things selfishly cling to the Dao,\nnot the Dao clinging to all things.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Dao’s Indwelling in Form**\nThere is no thing beneath Heaven without principle, no land without the Dao’s presence.\nWhere there is a thing’s form, there is its nature;\nwhere there is its nature, there is its disposition;\nwhere there is its disposition, there is its Dao.\nThe Dao’s presence in things relies on form to manifest its transformations in the world.\nThus nothing can resist transformation, nothing can escape its embrace.\nEven the *long* (dragon) and *hu* (tiger) in their changes—\nI forget their mechanisms, yet they submit of their own accord.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Dragon and the Tiger**\nThe dragon’s song, the tiger’s roar.\nThe dragon attains the Dao of *yang* (vitality), the tiger the omen of *yin* (passivity).\n*Yang* in the dragon, *yin* in the tiger—each has its own subtlety.\nThus the dragon sings and clouds follow, the tiger roars and winds arise.\nWinds and clouds transform, thunder and lightning crash.\nYet in their blind unity, they breathe as one—\nnot the Great Transformation’s own sentience.\nTherefore, when the Sage acts, divine transformations are unfathomable,\nand all things gather in silent reverence.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine: Rectifying Position**\nHeaven covers above, Earth bears below—all things arise between them.\nThe Sage rectifies his position to bring peace to all.\nHe who dwells in greatness fulfills greatness,\nhe who dwells in smallness fulfills smallness.\nThe people are my kin, yet I treat them as children.\nThus when I forget, the people forget;\nwhen I rejoice, the people rejoice;\nwhen I am at ease, the people are at ease.\nHence, when *Yao* ruled as sovereign,\nhe governed Heaven and Earth for fifty years yet claimed no merit—\nthis was his way.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Ten: The Virtue of Humility**\nThe Sage in his exalted position does not exalt himself,\ndoes not regard himself as noble,\ndoes not claim his own brilliance,\ndoes not boast of his own merits—\nthis is how he empties himself to await others.\nThus he does not exalt himself, to follow the multitude of Heaven and Earth.\nHe does not regard himself as noble, to measure the worth of the world’s worthy.\nHe does not claim his own brilliance, to exhaust the world’s perspectives.\nHe does not boast of his own merits, to reward the world’s deeds.\nThis is how he cultivates humility in himself,\nand only then does his virtue extend to benefit all.\nThus the people of Heaven and Earth cannot but revere him.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eleven: Sovereign and Minister**\nA sovereign without ministers cannot rise, a minister without a sovereign cannot act.\nWhen sovereign and minister share one heart, none can take Heaven and Earth.\nThe sovereign views the people as his children, the people view the sovereign as their mother.\nChild and mother in mutual affection—none can speak against it.\nMy relationship to the Dao:\nI nurture it as a mother, guard it as a child.\nChild and mother in mutual protection—\nlongevity and immortality are attained.\nI do not seek to differ from others,\nyet those who would depart cannot remain.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Dao and Virtue**\nThe Dao is the ultimate of goodness, *de* (virtue/power) is the foundation of goodness.\nThe highest goodness is not claimed as goodness—its Dao is naturally goodness.\nThe highest virtue is not claimed as virtue—its Dao is naturally virtue.\nWhat virtue can be obtained? None but that from the heart,\nilluminated by principle, to fulfill all things’ natures.\nNature is void yet loves to give birth—\nthus all things share in Dao and virtue.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: The Mandate of Heaven**\nThe mandate was first passed to Yi, then to the Son.\nYet the people sang no praises to Yi, but only to the Son—\nthus Heaven favored the Son, and the mandate was passed to him.\nAfter this, father and son succeeded one another,\nbut only when worthy could they be entrusted with the realm,\nand only then could they receive the mandate.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: Preservation and Guardianship**\nTo fear Heaven’s command preserves the self.\nTo fear the words of the Sage guards the law.\nPreserve the self and you endure long;\nguard the law and you achieve greatness.\nEndure long and your family and state face no peril;\nachieve greatness and your descendants face no ruin.\nWithout peril or ruin, you may preserve yourself and avoid harm.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Clarity and Emptiness**\nA mirror, when empty, is clear—\nit naturally reveals the beauty and ugliness of all.\nThe heart, when empty, is clear—\nit naturally knows the goodness and evil of all.\nEmptiness gathers form,\nclarity discerns color.\nBut form and color are mere illusions,\nnot the true essence.\nThus, the Sage holds emptiness supreme.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Preserving the Form**\nHow can people, born to life,\nfail to fear death?\nClimbing steep paths of the Dao,\nthey lose their true nature.\nWhy does the wild horse run without reins,\ngalloping without direction,\ngoing forth yet never returning?\nEver light and reckless, indulging in wild greed,\nthey hoard life yet bring ruin upon themselves—\nI have seen many such people.\nThus, the Sage always fears Heaven’s command,\nguards his station with reverence,\npreserves his *qi*,\nand nurtures his nature.\nTherefore, all things under Heaven\nharmonize with me in divine correspondence.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Rites and Music**\nIn daily life, rites and music must not be neglected.\nWith rites, the heart attends to reverence;\nwith music, the body attends to harmony.\nWhen the heart attends to reverence,\nall affairs are orderly.\nWhen the body attends to harmony,\nall spirits are at ease.\nWhen spirits are at ease,\n*qi* fills the void of the *chong* [conception vessel].\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Spirit and *Qi***\nThose who nurture the spirit well\nrestore their radiance day and night.\nThose who gather *qi* well\nmerge their essence with each breath.\nThe spirit dwells within *qi*,\n*qi* dwells within the spirit’s chamber.\nWhen spirit and *qi* unite in truth,\nthey ascend to the Supreme Clarity.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Perfect Clarity**\nTo focus inward is to forget the outer;\nto focus outward is to forget the inner.\nThis is not the Dao!\nHow can one nature be perfectly clear,\nwhen it is neither inner nor outer?\nIts existence has no form,\nits application leaves no trace.\nThus, the Sage’s Way is but turning a sphere—\nnothing more.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Insufficiency**\nThe good lack, the unvirtuous also lack.\nThe good lack because of insufficient learning;\nthe unvirtuous lack because of insatiable greed.\nTo seek learning’s insufficiency is to attain clarity;\nto seek greed’s insufficiency is to fall into darkness.\nClarity leads to sainthood,\ndarkness ends in folly.\nClarity and darkness differ by a hair’s breadth—\nhow can one not be cautious?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Ceasing Learning**\nStudy the learning of the masses,\nselect the good to learn from it.\nExhaust the principles of all things,\nilluminate what is unclear.\nTo abandon all learning is to have no worries;\nto exhaust all principles is to return to the root.\nWithout worries, one fulfills all things’ natures;\nwith the root, one attains the Dao of all things.\nNature and the Heavenly Way\nare in perfect accord.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Middle Path**\nOnly the Sage can walk the Middle Way;\neven the virtuous cannot follow.\nHow much less the foolish!\nThe Sage makes it round—\nthe virtuous make it square.\nThe round turns without clinging;\nthe square clings without turning.\nThus the Sage says:\nThe virtuous exceed it,\nthe foolish fall short.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Dignity and Comportment**\nThe Sage’s heart is deep, unfathomable,\nvast and transforming, without limit.\nHis bearing is awe-inspiring,\nhis virtue radiant and resplendent.\nHis virtue flows in cycles of three and five,\nemptying himself to align the four seasons\nas the standard for all under Heaven.\nWhen he sets the standard for all under Heaven,\nall things come into harmony.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Transformation and Motion**\nThe Dao is vast and boundless,\nmoving through the *tuo* [mysterious vessel].\nThe Dao, as a thing, is dim and indistinct,\nfathomless and unfathomable.\nYou cannot see its edges,\nyou cannot pierce its depths.\nGreat, it encompasses Earth and Heaven;\nsmall, it leaves no thing untouched.\nI too am in this—\nbefore the Nameless.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Penetrating the Mysterious**\nWho is the master when the tongue speaks?\nWho leads when the hand forms a fist?\nTo grasp this principle\nis to penetrate the Mysterious.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Essence of the Dao**\nThe Dao’s essence lies hidden in its orifices.\nPreserve the essence and life-*qi* is born;\npreserve *qi* and spirit is born;\npreserve the spirit and divine mystery is attained.\nThese three must not be lost—\nlose one, and the other two are lost as well.\nWhat then remains of the Dao?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Gain and Loss**\nDo not rejoice at a single gain,\nnor grieve at a single loss.\nGain without knowing when to stop—\nwhat you gain, you will surely lose.\nLose while knowing what to guard—\nwhat you lose, you will surely regain.\nThus, those who gain lose,\nand those who lose gain.\nOnly those who grasp the Dao’s essence\ncan truly know gain and loss.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Calming the Heart**\nGrass and trees take root in the earth to grow.\nHumans take root in the heart to establish life and fate.\nFertile soil makes branches and leaves flourish;\nan empty heart makes virtue and power permeate.\nYet people do not know their roots—\nthey steal from things with their hearts,\nonly to be stolen from by things in return;\nthey enslave their emotions to form,\nonly to be enslaved by form in return.\nThus, the one who gains loses,\nand the one who loses gains.\nTherefore, the Daoist takes nothing.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Forgetting Artifice**\nWhen humans forget artifice,\nbirds do not doubt.\nWhen humans’ artifice stirs,\nbirds take flight far away.\nWhy?\nForm may be deceived, but spirit cannot.\nWhen my spirit stirs slightly,\ntheir spirit knows it instantly.\nThis is the manifest Heavenly Principle\nthat cannot be concealed.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The True Void**\nThe True Void gives rise to the manifestation of form,\nand when form is held, it clings to the True Void.\nThe True Void is not form itself,\nand when it is held, it clings to form.\nClinging to form and clinging to the True Void—\nthose who do not recognize the essence of the Dao.\nThus, the form that is not form is the true form;\nthe void that is not void is the true void.\nTrue form and true void merge with all things.\nTo apply this and transcend its application—\nits transformations are boundless.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: The Doctrine of Having and Not-Having**\nNot-having while appearing to have is the superior;\nhaving while appearing not to have is the inferior.\nThus, the virtuous scholar broadens learning and knowledge,\nnot-having while truly possessing.\nThe petty scholar restricts learning and knowledge,\nnot-possessing while assuming it is.\nTherefore, I do not dare to lead the world—\nthis is what Laozi meant.\nIf it were about virtue and benevolence,\nhow could I dare?—\nthis is what Confucius meant.\nHaving as if not-having, being real as if void—\nthis is what Yanzi meant.\nThus, the one with humility in virtue is superior,\nthe one with thin virtue is inferior.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Weight of the Dao**\nThose who weigh heavily upon others are weighed heavily by others;\nthose who treat others lightly are treated lightly by others.\nEven things should not be treated lightly—\nhow much more so for humans?\nThus, the Sage governs the people as a tender infant,\nhonors the worthy and values virtue.\nTherefore, he does not dare to treat the world lightly,\nand the world’s people are at ease—\nhow could he not be weighed heavily?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Five Methods of Governance**\nThere are five methods by which the world is governed in accordance with the Dao:\nTo spread benevolence (*rén*) across the world, the people are at peace;\nTo impose righteousness (*yì*) upon the world, the people submit;\nTo teach propriety (*lǐ*) to the world, the people show respect;\nTo discern wisdom (*zhì*) across the world, the people are steadfast;\nTo cultivate trust (*xìn*) with the world, the people stand firm.\nThese five methods arise from the same source but differ in name.\nThus, the Sage embodies the Dao as if it were void,\nyet applies it with abundance.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: Observing the Dao**\nObserving the Dao is like observing the plum blossom.\nThe sea dwells in lowliness,\nyet it can contain the flow of all rivers.\nIts gathering is deep,\nits waves rise high,\nand dragons, fish, shrimp, and turtles all find joy in their nature.\nThus, the Sage’s heart is also like the sea,\nand it can contain the filth of all nations.\nThe more it stores the heart,\nthe more void and deep it becomes;\nthe more it acts in the world,\nthe more abundant and present it is.\nRulers and commoners alike\nfind joy in their own place.\nThis is why the Dao is present in the world,\nand the lowly become the exalted.\nThe Void of the True Void.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: The True Void**\nThe True Void gives rise to form,\nand form returns to the True Void.\nThe True Void is the heart and spirit;\nform is the body and *qi*.\nWhen the heart is void,\nthe spirit is at ease,\nand the body and *qi* are abundant.\nWhen the heart is clouded,\nthe spirit is obstructed,\nand the body and *qi* self-destruct.\nThus, the Sage always maintains a void heart,\nand is skilled in nurturing spirit and *qi*.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Constant Heart**\nThose who possess a constant heart have a constant Dao;\nthose who lack a constant heart lack a constant Dao.\nA constant heart does not falter,\na constant Dao does not alter;\na constant heart is not absent,\na constant Dao is not exhausted.\nTherefore, the virtuous scholar always abides in a tranquil heart,\nand examines himself from within.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Loyalty and Filial Piety**\nThose who are good at loyalty must be good at filial piety,\nand those who are good at filial piety must be good at loyalty.\nAt home, one transfers loyalty and filial piety to one’s parents,\nand the way of the son is complete.\nAbroad, one transfers loyalty and filial piety to one’s lord,\nand the way of the subject is complete.\nThus, lord and parents are one;\nloyalty and filial piety are also one.\nThose who excel in both loyalty and filial piety\nembody the Dao of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: Rectifying Nature**\nConfucius would not drink from the stolen well,\nand Zengzi turned his carriage around to avoid passing by his mother’s village.\nEven the ancients, upon hearing an unrighteous name,\navoided it themselves—\nhow much more so for the Dao they practice?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Holding the Middle**\nThe Sage’s Dao is simply to hold the middle.\nTo bear the world’s responsibilities,\nto walk the world’s Dao—\nwhether high or low,\nall are treated with equal balance.\nWhat benefits is diminished,\nwhat diminishes is benefited.\nBenefiting the lowly,\nthe humble rise upward;\ndimishing the exalted,\nthe high fall to the low.\nThis is why, in diminishing excess and benefiting deficiency,\nthe high and low are in harmony,\nand all affairs in the world are balanced.\n\n**Chapter Forty: Essence and Application**\nEmbody the Dao with sincerity,\nand the Dao will find its own ease.\nApply the Dao in due season,\nand the Dao will find its own benefit.\nThus, one who is at ease within\nhas a spirit that is never discordant.\nOne who benefits without\nhas a spirit that is never obstructed.\nTo observe the Dao in stillness,\nthe Dao is never still;\nto observe the Dao in motion,\nthe Dao is never in motion.\nMotion and stillness merge with the Dao—\nonly sincerity can achieve this.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Spirit’s Void**\nHuman spirit is the void essence of Heaven and Earth.\nThe nature of spirit\ncannot be pondered,\ncannot be perceived,\ncannot be spoken of,\ncannot be sought.\nWhy?\nTo ponder it makes it not spirit,\nto perceive it makes it not sincere,\nto speak of it makes it not pure,\nto seek it makes it not true.\nThus, it hides the small body,\nand encompasses the Great Void;\nit reveals the great body,\nand pervades the dust of the world;\nit enters water and does not drown,\nit enters fire and is not burned;\nit pierces metal and penetrates stone,\nit emerges from darkness and reaches the depths.\nThose who understand this principle\ncan command the spirits and deities.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: Unobstructed Understanding**\nThe heart must not be held fast,\naffairs must not be rigidly adhered to.\nWhen the heart is held fast,\nnature does not reach its fullness;\nwhen affairs are rigidly adhered to,\nprinciple does not flow freely.\nA void heart aligns with Heaven,\nand nature is fully realized.\nWalking the Dao aligns with righteousness,\nand principle flows freely.\nThus, the Sage conceals his heart within the four directions,\nand his affairs are never rigidly held.\nThe Auspicious Effect.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: The Auspicious and the Inauspicious**\nThe auspicious person purifies himself to serve Heaven,\nthe inauspicious person defiles his conduct to seek sustenance.\nThe Dao of serving Heaven\nlies in frugality and restraint.\nThe Dao of seeking sustenance\nlies in coveting abundance.\nThus, the frugal are necessarily virtuous and abundant in power,\nand Heaven’s Dao always aids the auspicious;\nthe covetous are necessarily lost in abundance,\nand the spirits’ Dao often confuses the inauspicious.\nTherefore, the pursuit of food\nis the root of all disorder in nature.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The Knowing of Stopping**\nFish swim in deep streams, beasts rely on lofty heights.\nEach creature knows where to cease—\nwhy does man lose his heart,\nyet fail to know his home?\n\nThus, the heart is the sovereign of the body.\nTo possess it brings flourishing,\nto lose it brings ruin.\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Attending to the Root**\nThe movement of the Dao splits into two functions.\nTherefore, creation and transformation mutually support,\ngood and evil interdependently arise,\nlife and death follow in tandem,\nthe strong exploit the weak,\nand kindness and harm lean upon each other.\nThose who fail to recognize the root\nwhile chasing after superficial ends—\nthese are the deluded of mankind.\n\nHence, those who skillfully wield the Dao\npreserve its essence,\nfollow its applications,\nrestrain movement to return to stillness,\nand restore feeling to its original nature.\nWhen nature is empty and aligned with truth,\nthey enjoy the Way’s command with tranquil ease.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: The Natural**\nThe spider weaves its web,\nthe dung beetle rolls its ball—\nwithout instruction yet mastering their arts,\nthis is the natural work of Heaven’s inherent nature.\n\nThus, the Sage also embodies the Dao’s natural spontaneity,\never teaching the people to hold fast to simplicity and sincerity:\nto drink from dug wells,\nto eat from tilled fields,\nwithout revealing their knowing,\nwithout letting them grasp their doing.\nIn their mutual exchanges without harm,\nthe people reach old age and die without litigation,\nrejoicing in the harmonious concord of *Yongxi*’s [1] peace.\n\nEven with governance and decrees—\nwhat need is there for their enforcement?\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven: The Response**\n\nThe Dao’s manifestation in the divine and hidden—\nits virtue and power are evident.\n\nThe dragon’s transformations, the tiger’s shifts—\nthe flow of *qi* is harmonized.\n\nThe Sage acts in accordance with Heaven’s time,\nand human hearts respond.\n\nThus, the divine changes of the Sage—\nghostly apparitions are beyond measure.\nThe transformations of dragon and tiger—\ninsects and beasts are beyond measure.\nThe Sage’s changes—\nthe masses are beyond measure.\nIf the divine can be measured,\nit is not divine.\nIf dragon and tiger can be measured,\nthey are no different from common creatures.\nIf the Sage can be measured,\nthe world will not revere Him.\n\nTherefore, those who dwell in the great—\never maintain their solemn authority,\never uphold their divine essence.\nWith the Dao transforming the world,\nthe world returns to His embrace.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight: Self-Reliance**\n\nThose who rely on wealth and noble status\nmust grow arrogant in themselves.\nThose who rely on achievements and renown\nmust grow restless in themselves.\nThose who rely on learning and letters\nmust grow contemptuous in themselves.\nThose who rely on favor and affection\nmust bring shame upon themselves.\n\nThese four forms of reliance—\nthey are the afflictions of man.\nThus, arrogance brings no longevity,\nrestlessness brings no endurance,\ncontempt brings no illumination,\nshame brings no fortune.\n\nTherefore, the virtuous man in wealth and noble status\ndoes not grow self-important,\nin success and renown\ndoes not claim them as his own,\nin extensive learning\ndoes not boast of his knowledge,\nin favor and affection\ndoes not flaunt his standing.\n\nGuard against the slightest beginnings,\ncheck the growth of evil,\nbalance action and stillness with the Dao,\nand remain serene and unassuming.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: Attaining Harmony**\n\nWhen Heaven’s Dao loses harmony,\nthe sun and moon grow dim in their brilliance.\nWhen Earth’s Dao loses harmony,\nmountains and stones crumble and topple.\nWhen Man’s Dao loses harmony,\nhis vital *qi* scatters and dissipates.\nWhen the Four Seasons lose harmony,\nall things do not flourish.\n\nYet how does Heaven attain harmony and so radiate purity?\nThe sun and moon shine naturally.\nHow does Earth attain harmony and so bring lasting peace?\nMountains and stones stand firm of their own accord.\nHow does Man attain harmony and so become spiritually attuned?\nHis vital *qi* condenses naturally.\nHow do the Four Seasons attain harmony and so move in their course?\nAll things flourish naturally.\n\nTherefore, those who follow this Dao\nadapt to the transformations of yin and yang.\nThose who return to this Dao\nmay tread upon the void.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty: The Creative Transformation**\n\nHeaven has day and night,\nthe coming and going of one *qi*.\nMan has life and death,\nthe gathering and scattering of one *qi*.\nDay and night, life and death—\nthey share the same Creative Transformation.\n\nThus, there must be night when there is day,\ndeath when there is life,\nreturn when there is departure,\ndispersion when there is gathering—\nthese are the necessary principles.\n\nOnly the divine in Heaven and Earth\nilluminates the void without form,\nneither born nor dying,\nneither gathering nor scattering.\nThus, it knows without words,\nreaches without movement,\nacquires without thought,\nand achieves without action.\n\nHe who comprehends this\nmay transcend life and death,\nescape Heaven and Earth.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One: Borrowed Speech**\n\nThe Sage employs borrowed speech to reveal the Dao—\nhis words have no fixed form.\nThe worthy man seizes upon speech to discuss the Dao—\nhis words bear concrete symbols.\n\nThus, speech without fixed form\nholds meaning before the image is drawn.\nSpeech with concrete symbols\nholds meaning after the image is drawn.\nIf the worthy man could abandon form and discard wisdom,\npreserve the divine and embrace the center,\ndwelling in speech with symbols yet not clinging—\nhe would also be a Sage.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: Non-Contentiousness**\n\nThe Dao is without contention,\nyet those who contend are not of the Dao.\nThe Dao is without attachment,\nyet those who cling are not of the Dao.\n\nThus, those who love contention\npossess discriminating wisdom,\nthose who love attachment\nknow distinctions of self and other.\nThey are the ones who see,\nyet abandon the Dao,\nand lose its virtue.\n\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse garments to conceal his brilliance,\nholds jade within his breast,\ndwelling among the people without contention,\nwithout attachment,\npreserving and uniting the *qi* of Great Harmony,\nand aligning with Heaven and Earth in the Four Seasons.\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: Dao’s Transformation**\n\nThe Dao transforms *qi*,\n*qi* forms blood,\nblood shapes the body,\nthe body gives rise to things,\nthings transform into myriad forms.\n\nIts transformations are not singular,\nyet its divine essence is one.\n\nWhen *qi* transforms into turbidity,\nits divine essence is malevolent.\nWhen *qi* transforms into clarity,\nits divine essence is luminous.\n\nThe lifeless becoming sentient,\nthe sentient becoming lifeless—\nthey are the same *qi* in division,\nall things diverse in form yet unified in essence.\n\nObserve the beginning of Great Transformation,\nwhere there is neither form nor name.\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: Public Heart**\n\nAs a minister of the Sage,\none who aids the ruler with the Dao\nmust purify himself to serve the public good.\n\nIf the ruler does not restrict his benevolence,\nthe virtue of the ruler will descend.\nIf the minister does not restrict his words,\nthe sentiments of the people will ascend.\nWhen ruler and minister are in harmony,\nthe Dao of the state will always flourish.\n\nIf one gains favor from above,\nsecretly wields power,\nand seeks personal gain through authority—\nhe will surely invite disaster.\nIs this not a truth?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: Public Heart**\n\nThe upright Sage and the virtuous gentleman,\ncalm and open in their hearts.\nWhen employed, they expound the Dao in court and hall;\nwhen not employed, they retreat into the woods, humble and unassuming.\nIn wealth and honor, they do not grow arrogant;\nin poverty and lowliness, they do not fawn.\nAdvancing and withdrawing, they measure the proper course;\nin action and repose, they conform to what is fitting.\nThey always follow the Way of Heaven without deceit in their hearts—\nthus they may be called the upright Sage and the virtuous gentleman.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Rectified Person**\n\nThe *Dao Xuan* [Mysterious Dao] section concludes.",

It is the differing *qi*’s inherent disposition,\nnot the nature’s original essence.\nThus all things selfishly cling to the Dao,\nnot the Dao clinging to all things.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Dao’s Indwelling in Form**\nThere is no thing beneath Heaven without principle, no land without the Dao’s presence.\nWhere there is a thing’s form, there is its nature;\nwhere there is its nature, there is its disposition;\nwhere there is its disposition, there is its Dao.\nThe Dao’s presence in things relies on form to manifest its transformations in the world.\nThus nothing can resist transformation, nothing can escape its embrace.\nEven the *long* (dragon) and *hu* (tiger) in their changes—\nI forget their mechanisms, yet they submit of their own accord.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Dragon and the Tiger**\nThe dragon’s song, the tiger’s roar.\nThe dragon attains the Dao of *yang* (vitality), the tiger the omen of *yin* (passivity).\n*Yang* in the dragon, *yin* in the tiger—each has its own subtlety.\nThus the dragon sings and clouds follow, the tiger roars and winds arise.\nWinds and clouds transform, thunder and lightning crash.\nYet in their blind unity, they breathe as one—\nnot the Great Transformation’s own sentience.\nTherefore, when the Sage acts, divine transformations are unfathomable,\nand all things gather in silent reverence.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine: Rectifying Position**\nHeaven covers above, Earth bears below—all things arise between them.\nThe Sage rectifies his position to bring peace to all.\nHe who dwells in greatness fulfills greatness,\nhe who dwells in smallness fulfills smallness.\nThe people are my kin, yet I treat them as children.\nThus when I forget, the people forget;\nwhen I rejoice, the people rejoice;\nwhen I am at ease, the people are at ease.\nHence, when *Yao* ruled as sovereign,\nhe governed Heaven and Earth for fifty years yet claimed no merit—\nthis was his way.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Ten: The Virtue of Humility**\nThe Sage in his exalted position does not exalt himself,\ndoes not regard himself as noble,\ndoes not claim his own brilliance,\ndoes not boast of his own merits—\nthis is how he empties himself to await others.\nThus he does not exalt himself, to follow the multitude of Heaven and Earth.\nHe does not regard himself as noble, to measure the worth of the world’s worthy.\nHe does not claim his own brilliance, to exhaust the world’s perspectives.\nHe does not boast of his own merits, to reward the world’s deeds.\nThis is how he cultivates humility in himself,\nand only then does his virtue extend to benefit all.\nThus the people of Heaven and Earth cannot but revere him.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eleven: Sovereign and Minister**\nA sovereign without ministers cannot rise, a minister without a sovereign cannot act.\nWhen sovereign and minister share one heart, none can take Heaven and Earth.\nThe sovereign views the people as his children, the people view the sovereign as their mother.\nChild and mother in mutual affection—none can speak against it.\nMy relationship to the Dao:\nI nurture it as a mother, guard it as a child.\nChild and mother in mutual protection—\nlongevity and immortality are attained.\nI do not seek to differ from others,\nyet those who would depart cannot remain.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Dao and Virtue**\nThe Dao is the ultimate of goodness, *de* (virtue/power) is the foundation of goodness.\nThe highest goodness is not claimed as goodness—its Dao is naturally goodness.\nThe highest virtue is not claimed as virtue—its Dao is naturally virtue.\nWhat virtue can be obtained? None but that from the heart,\nilluminated by principle, to fulfill all things’ natures.\nNature is void yet loves to give birth—\nthus all things share in Dao and virtue.",

favored the Son, and the mandate was passed to him.\nAfter this, father and son succeeded one another,\nbut only when worthy could they be entrusted with the realm,\nand only then could they receive the mandate.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: Preservation and Guardianship**\nTo fear Heaven’s command preserves the self.\nTo fear the words of the Sage guards the law.\nPreserve the self and you endure long;\nguard the law and you achieve greatness.\nEndure long and your family and state face no peril;\nachieve greatness and your descendants face no ruin.\nWithout peril or ruin, you may preserve yourself and avoid harm.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Clarity and Emptiness**\nA mirror, when empty, is clear—\nit naturally reveals the beauty and ugliness of all.\nThe heart, when empty, is clear—\nit naturally knows the goodness and evil of all.\nEmptiness gathers form,\nclarity discerns color.\nBut form and color are mere illusions,\nnot the true essence.\nThus, the Sage holds emptiness supreme.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Preserving the Form**\nHow can people, born to life,\nfail to fear death?\nClimbing steep paths of the Dao,\nthey lose their true nature.\nWhy does the wild horse run without reins,\ngalloping without direction,\ngoing forth yet never returning?\nEver light and reckless, indulging in wild greed,\nthey hoard life yet bring ruin upon themselves—\nI have seen many such people.\nThus, the Sage always fears Heaven’s command,\nguards his station with reverence,\npreserves his *qi*,\nand nurtures his nature.\nTherefore, all things under Heaven\nharmonize with me in divine correspondence.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Rites and Music**\nIn daily life, rites and music must not be neglected.\nWith rites, the heart attends to reverence;\nwith music, the body attends to harmony.\nWhen the heart attends to reverence,\nall affairs are orderly.\nWhen the body attends to harmony,\nall spirits are at ease.\nWhen spirits are at ease,\n*qi* fills the void of the *chong* [conception vessel].\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Spirit and *Qi***\nThose who nurture the spirit well\nrestore their radiance day and night.\nThose who gather *qi* well\nmerge their essence with each breath.\nThe spirit dwells within *qi*,\n*qi* dwells within the spirit’s chamber.\nWhen spirit and *qi* unite in truth,\nthey ascend to the Supreme Clarity.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Perfect Clarity**\nTo focus inward is to forget the outer;\nto focus outward is to forget the inner.\nThis is not the Dao!\nHow can one nature be perfectly clear,\nwhen it is neither inner nor outer?\nIts existence has no form,\nits application leaves no trace.\nThus, the Sage’s Way is but turning a sphere—\nnothing more.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Insufficiency**\nThe good lack, the unvirtuous also lack.\nThe good lack because of insufficient learning;\nthe unvirtuous lack because of insatiable greed.\nTo seek learning’s insufficiency is to attain clarity;\nto seek greed’s insufficiency is to fall into darkness.\nClarity leads to sainthood,\ndarkness ends in folly.\nClarity and darkness differ by a hair’s breadth—\nhow can one not be cautious?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Ceasing Learning**\nStudy the learning of the masses,\nselect the good to learn from it.\nExhaust the principles of all things,\nilluminate what is unclear.\nTo abandon all learning is to have no worries;\nto exhaust all principles is to return to the root.\nWithout worries, one fulfills all things’ natures;\nwith the root, one attains the Dao of all things.\nNature and the Heavenly Way\nare in perfect accord.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Middle Path**\nOnly the Sage can walk the Middle Way;\neven the virtuous cannot follow.\nHow much less the foolish!\nThe Sage makes it round—\nthe virtuous make it square.\nThe round turns without clinging;\nthe square clings without turning.\nThus the Sage says:\nThe virtuous exceed it,\nthe foolish fall short.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Dignity and Comportment**\nThe Sage’s heart is deep, unfathomable,\nvast and transforming, without limit.\nHis bearing is awe-inspiring,\nhis virtue radiant and resplendent.\nHis virtue flows in cycles of three and five,\nemptying himself to align the four seasons\nas the standard for all under Heaven.\nWhen he sets the standard for all under Heaven,\nall things come into harmony.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Transformation and Motion**\nThe Dao is vast and boundless,\nmoving through the *tuo* [mysterious vessel].\nThe Dao, as a thing, is dim and indistinct,\nfathomless and unfathomable.\nYou cannot see its edges,\nyou cannot pierce its depths.\nGreat, it encompasses Earth and Heaven;\nsmall, it leaves no thing untouched.\nI too am in this—\nbefore the Nameless.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Penetrating the Mysterious**\nWho is the master when the tongue speaks?\nWho leads when the hand forms a fist?\nTo grasp this principle\nis to penetrate the Mysterious.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Essence of the Dao**\nThe Dao’s essence lies hidden in its orifices.\nPreserve the essence and life-*qi* is born;\npreserve *qi* and spirit is born;\npreserve the spirit and divine mystery is attained.\nThese three must not be lost—\nlose one, and the other two are lost as well.\nWhat then remains of the Dao?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Gain and Loss**\nDo not rejoice at a single gain,\nnor grieve at a single loss.\nGain without knowing when to stop—\nwhat you gain, you will surely lose.\nLose while knowing what to guard—\nwhat you lose, you will surely regain.\nThus, those who gain lose,\nand those who lose gain.\nOnly those who grasp the Dao’s essence\ncan truly know gain and loss.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Calming the Heart**\nGrass and trees take root in the earth to grow.\nHumans take root in the heart to establish life and fate.\nFertile soil makes branches and leaves flourish;\nan empty heart makes virtue and power permeate.\nYet people do not know their roots—\nthey steal from things with their hearts,\nonly to be stolen from by things in return;\nthey enslave their emotions to form,\nonly to be enslaved by form in return.\nThus, the one who gains loses,\nand the one who loses gains.\nTherefore, the Daoist takes nothing.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Forgetting Artifice**\nWhen humans forget artifice,\nbirds do not doubt.\nWhen humans’ artifice stirs,\nbirds take flight far

form itself,\nand when it is held, it clings to form.\nClinging to form and clinging to the True Void—\nthose who do not recognize the essence of the Dao.\nThus, the form that is not form is the true form;\nthe void that is not void is the true void.\nTrue form and true void merge with all things.\nTo apply this and transcend its application—\nits transformations are boundless.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: The Doctrine of Having and Not-Having**\nNot-having while appearing to have is the superior;\nhaving while appearing not to have is the inferior.\nThus, the virtuous scholar broadens learning and knowledge,\nnot-having while truly possessing.\nThe petty scholar restricts learning and knowledge,\nnot-possessing while assuming it is.\nTherefore, I do not dare to lead the world—\nthis is what Laozi meant.\nIf it were about virtue and benevolence,\nhow could I dare?—\nthis is what Confucius meant.\nHaving as if not-having, being real as if void—\nthis is what Yanzi meant.\nThus, the one with humility in virtue is superior,\nthe one with thin virtue is inferior.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Weight of the Dao**\nThose who weigh heavily upon others are weighed heavily by others;\nthose who treat others lightly are treated lightly by others.\nEven things should not be treated lightly—\nhow much more so for humans?\nThus, the Sage governs the people as a tender infant,\nhonors the worthy and values virtue.\nTherefore, he does not dare to treat the world lightly,\nand the world’s people are at ease—\nhow could he not be weighed heavily?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Five Methods of Governance**\nThere are five methods by which the world is governed in accordance with the Dao:\nTo spread benevolence (*rén*) across the world, the people are at peace;\nTo impose righteousness (*yì*) upon the world, the people submit;\nTo teach propriety (*lǐ*) to the world, the people show respect;\nTo discern wisdom (*zhì*) across the world, the people are steadfast;\nTo cultivate trust (*xìn*) with the world, the people stand firm.\nThese five methods arise from the same source but differ in name.\nThus, the Sage embodies the Dao as if it were void,\nyet applies it with abundance.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: Observing the Dao**\nObserving the Dao is like observing the plum blossom.\nThe sea dwells in lowliness,\nyet it can contain the flow of all rivers.\nIts gathering is deep,\nits waves rise high,\nand dragons, fish, shrimp, and turtles all find joy in their nature.\nThus, the Sage’s heart is also like the sea,\nand it can contain the filth of all nations.\nThe more it stores the heart,\nthe more void and deep it becomes;\nthe more it acts in the world,\nthe more abundant and present it is.\nRulers and commoners alike\nfind joy in their own place.\nThis is why the Dao is present in the world,\nand the lowly become the exalted.\nThe Void of the True Void.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: The True Void**\nThe True Void gives rise to form,\nand form returns to the True Void.\nThe True Void is the heart and spirit;\nform is the body and *qi*.\nWhen the heart is void,\nthe spirit is at ease,\nand the body and *qi* are abundant.\nWhen the heart is clouded,\nthe spirit is obstructed,\nand the body and *qi* self-destruct.\nThus, the Sage always maintains a void heart,\nand is skilled in nurturing spirit and *qi*.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Constant Heart**\nThose who possess a constant heart have a constant Dao;\nthose who lack a constant heart lack a constant Dao.\nA constant heart does not falter,\na constant Dao does not alter;\na constant heart is not absent,\na constant Dao is not exhausted.\nTherefore, the virtuous scholar always abides in a tranquil heart,\nand examines himself from within.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Loyalty and Filial Piety**\nThose who are good at loyalty must be good at filial piety,\nand those who are good at filial piety must be good at loyalty.\nAt home, one transfers loyalty and filial piety to one’s parents,\nand the way of the son is complete.\nAbroad, one transfers loyalty and filial piety to one’s lord,\nand the way of the subject is complete.\nThus, lord and parents are one;\nloyalty and filial piety are also one.\nThose who excel in both loyalty and filial piety\nembody the Dao of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: Rectifying Nature**\nConfucius would not drink from the stolen well,\nand Zengzi turned his carriage around to avoid passing by his mother’s village.\nEven the ancients, upon hearing an unrighteous name,\navoided it themselves—\nhow much more so for the Dao they practice?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Holding the Middle**\nThe Sage’s Dao is simply to hold the middle.\nTo bear the world’s responsibilities,\nto walk the world’s Dao—\nwhether high or low,\nall are treated with equal balance.\nWhat benefits is diminished,\nwhat diminishes is benefited.\nBenefiting the lowly,\nthe humble rise upward;\ndimishing the exalted,\nthe high fall to the low.\nThis is why, in diminishing excess and benefiting deficiency,\nthe high and low are in harmony,\nand all affairs in the world are balanced.\n\n**Chapter Forty: Essence and Application**\nEmbody the Dao with sincerity,\nand the Dao will find its own ease.\nApply the Dao in due season,\nand the Dao will find its own benefit.\nThus, one who is at ease within\nhas a spirit that is never discordant.\nOne who benefits without\nhas a spirit that is never obstructed.\nTo observe the Dao in stillness,\nthe Dao is never still;\nto observe the Dao in motion,\nthe Dao is never in motion.\nMotion and stillness merge with the Dao—\nonly sincerity can achieve this.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Spirit’s Void**\nHuman spirit is the void essence of Heaven and Earth.\nThe nature of spirit\ncannot be pondered,\ncannot be perceived,\ncannot be spoken of,\ncannot be sought.\nWhy?\nTo ponder it makes it not spirit,\nto perceive it makes it not sincere,\nto speak of it makes it not pure,\nto seek it makes it not true.\nThus, it hides the small body,\nand encompasses the Great Void;\nit reveals the great body,\nand pervades the dust of the world;\nit enters water and does not drown,\nit enters fire and is not burned;\nit pierces metal and penetrates stone,\nit emerges from darkness and reaches the depths.\nThose who understand this principle\ncan command the spirits and deities.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: Unobstructed Understanding**\nThe heart must not be held fast,\naffairs must not be rigidly adhered to.\nWhen the heart is held fast,\nnature does not reach its fullness;\nwhen affairs are rigidly adhered to,\nprinciple does not flow freely.\nA void heart aligns with Heaven,\nand nature is fully realized.\nWalking the Dao aligns with righteousness,\nand principle flows freely.\nThus, the Sage conceals his heart within the four directions,\nand his affairs are never rigidly held.\nThe Auspicious Effect.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: The Auspicious and the Inauspicious**\nThe auspicious person purifies himself to serve Heaven,\nthe inauspicious person defiles his conduct to seek sustenance.\nThe Dao of serving Heaven\nlies in frugality and restraint.\nThe Dao of seeking sustenance\nlies in coveting abundance.\nThus, the frugal are necessarily virtuous and abundant in power,\nand Heaven’s Dao always aids the auspicious;\nthe covetous are necessarily lost in abundance,\nand the spirits’ Dao often confuses the inauspicious.\nTherefore, the pursuit of food\nis the root of all disorder in nature.",

on wealth and noble status\nmust grow arrogant in themselves.\nThose who rely on achievements and renown\nmust grow restless in themselves.\nThose who rely on learning and letters\nmust grow contemptuous in themselves.\nThose who rely on favor and affection\nmust bring shame upon themselves.\n\nThese four forms of reliance—\nthey are the afflictions of man.\nThus, arrogance brings no

speech to discuss the Dao—\nhis words bear concrete symbols.\n\nThus, speech without fixed form\nholds meaning before the image is drawn.\nSpeech with concrete symbols\nholds meaning after the image
