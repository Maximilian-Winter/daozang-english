of Numinous Aid,\npervading the Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens to form a canopy of treasures,\noffered to the luminously manifest and universally aiding Venerable Lord of Vast Grace.\n\nMay this fragrant smoke\nbe offered to the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace of the Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens,\nand to the true immortals and sacred hosts of the Palace of Numinous Aid.\n\nWe devote our bodies and lives,\nreverently relying on the True Lords and sacred hosts.\nThrough the merit of this pinch of incense,\nwe pray for the August Emperor,\nhumbly wishing him ten thousand years of longevity,\nhis brightness equaling the Two Luminaries,\nunified in culture and governance,\nwith chariots and writings extending to the eight directions.\nMay he be sagely and divine,\nwith rites and music flourishing through a thousand ages.\nMay the weapons of the four frontiers be stilled,\nmay the myriad regions enjoy abundant harvests.\nMay blessings protect the Crown Prince,\nextending his sagely years for a thousand autumns.\nMay the imperial destiny be exalted,\nits great foundation enduring for ten thousand generations.\nMay we, your servants, assist in the harmony and prosperity,\nas all within the borders receive auspicious favor.\nMay the three seasons bring no harm,\nmay the four seas remain eternally clear.\n\nNow, therefore, we kindle incense,\nreturning body and life to the virtue of the Perfected Saints and the Great Sagely Host,\nwho, having attained the Dao,\npreserve heaven’s enduring existence,\nharmonizing: in unity with the Dao and the True.\n\nWith clarity and brightness at dawn,\nwe face and ascend to heaven,\nmorning radiance illuminating the courtly ranks,\nsunlight unfolding within night’s ravines.\nOn this day of devotion,\nwe ascend the altar and perform the Dao,\noffering these three pinches of incense,\nharmonizing: may the incense reach the Palace of Numinous Aid,\npervading the nine celestial palaces as clouds form a canopy,\nto make offering to the Perfected Immortals and Sagely Host of the Palace of Numinous Aid.\nMay this fragrant smoke\nmake offering to the August Emperor of the Golden Gates of the Nine Heavens,\nthe August Emperor of the Jade Gates of the Nine Heavens,\nand the Perfected Immortals and Sagely Host within the Palace of Numinous Aid.\n\nWe, your servants, return body and life,\nreverently relying upon the Perfected Lords and Sagely Host.\nMay the merit of this incense offering\nflow to the Crown Prince, the imperial screens,\nthe chief ministers and officials,\nthe

kindle incense,\nreturning body and life to the virtue of the Perfected Saints and the Great Sagely Host,\nwho, having attained the Dao,\nforever preserve eternal life,\nharmonizing: in unity with the Dao and the True.\n\n*Invocation of the Directions*\n*Repentance of the Directions*\n\n**Triple Invocation Hymn, Triple Reverence, Reaffirmation of the Sacred Titles**\n\nWe, your humble servants, [Name] and the assembled officiants of this altar, with utmost sincerity, reverently invoke the sacred ranks once more.\n\nWe have heard that to assist the myriad immortals is to flourish in profound subtlety, and to perform a single good deed is to summon blessings as swiftly as echo follows sound. The radiance of the Dao’s transformative power shines resplendent; the descent of the divine spirits’ gaze overflows with majesty. What is felt is met with response; no plea goes unanswered.\n\nBy the sacred decree, we reverently conduct the Golden Register rites, manifesting gratitude for the gods’ mighty works. We, your servants, humbly measure the purity of our long-held devotion and look up to repay the sustaining power of the Dao. Like the great luminous tree of dawn, we scatter the morning court’s rising sun; like the pine blossoms’ offering, we waft fragrant winds across the altar’s expanse.\n\nOur reverent devotion in sacrifice burns fervently; our awe arises from the depths of sincerity. Arrayed before the imperial throne, we wondrously unfold the immortal teachings. The three karmas and six senses remain uncleansed of lifetimes’ transgressions; the nine luminaries and ten poles merely reflect the radiance of the host of sages. We but seek absolution for our faults and hope that grace may flow abundantly.\n\nAbove, we pray for the empire’s enduring stability and the sovereign’s boundless longevity. May the myriad lands sing of prosperous fortune, and the four seas rejoice in governance without strife. May weapons of war be stilled, and the harvests overflow. Thus may all beings—whether moving or still, great or small, high or low—equally bathe in the nurturing growth of heaven and earth, all relying on creation’s power for their existence.\n\nMay those who wear starry crowns and jade hairpins delight in their forest and stream retreats; may those who till fields and dig wells rejoice in the songs of crossroads and fields. May the teachings flourish and the scriptures spread, so that above, the true lords’ great compassion is made manifest, and below, your servants’ devotion in submission is fulfilled.\n\nWe humbly present this invocation. Our vows are made.\n\nMay the Fragrance Burner, the Envoys of the Incense Bureau, the Divine Lords of Left and Right, and all attendant spirit-officials of the incense cause golden elixir, cinnabar, and azure mushroom blossoms to spontaneously arise in the place of this morning’s audience. May the hundred numinous spirits and assembled perfected ones gather here before this incense burner. May our sincere devotion ascend on high, bringing peace to household and state. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the rising incense smoke, conveying the words we have just presented, swiftly and directly to the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, before the August Presence of the Vast Grace Perfected Lord, the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, before the August Presence of the Vast Grace Perfected Lord. May the Vast Grace Numinous Aid Perfected Lord naturally complete the ritual of the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "**Triple Invocation Hymn, Triple Reverence, Reaffirmation of the Sacred Titles**\n\nWe, your humble servants, [Name] and the assembled officiants of this altar, with utmost sincerity, reverently invoke the sacred ranks once more.\n\nWe have heard that to assist the myriad immortals is to flourish in profound subtlety, and to perform a single good deed is to summon blessings as swiftly as echo follows sound. The radiance of the Dao’s transformative power shines resplendent; the descent of the divine spirits’ gaze overflows with majesty. What is felt is met with response; no plea goes unanswered.\n\nBy the sacred decree, we reverently conduct the Golden Register rites, manifesting gratitude for the gods’ mighty works. We, your servants, humbly measure the purity of our long-held devotion and look up to repay the sustaining power of the Dao. Like the great luminous tree of dawn, we scatter the morning court’s rising sun; like the pine blossoms’ offering, we waft fragrant winds across the altar’s expanse.\n\nOur reverent devotion in sacrifice burns fervently; our awe arises from the depths of sincerity. Arrayed before the imperial throne, we wondrously unfold the immortal teachings. The three karmas and six senses remain uncleansed of lifetimes’ transgressions; the nine luminaries and ten poles merely reflect the radiance of the host of sages. We but seek absolution for our faults and hope that grace may flow abundantly.\n\nAbove, we pray for the empire’s enduring stability and the sovereign’s boundless longevity. May the myriad lands sing of prosperous fortune, and the four seas rejoice in governance without strife. May weapons of war be stilled, and the harvests overflow. Thus may all beings—whether moving or still, great or small, high or low—equally bathe in the nurturing growth of heaven and earth, all relying on creation’s power for their existence.\n\nMay those who wear starry crowns and jade hairpins delight in their forest and stream retreats; may those who till fields and dig wells rejoice in the songs of crossroads and fields. May the teachings flourish and the scriptures spread, so that above, the true lords’ great compassion is made manifest, and below, your servants’ devotion in submission is fulfilled.\n\nWe humbly present this invocation. Our vows are made.",
