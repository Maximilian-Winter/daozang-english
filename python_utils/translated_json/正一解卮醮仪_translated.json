Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. One fascicle. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, *Weiyi* category.\n\n**Zhengyi Ritual for Resolving Calamities**\nFor those whose years, fate, or destiny are afflicted by calamities—whether by the baleful influence of the *yuanchen* (primary destiny), the inauspicious *siji* (death taboos), the exhaustion of the *Five Luos* calculations, the *yang-nine* and *yin-eight* cycles, theft, slander, illness, official misfortune, financial loss, or any encounter with disaster and sorrow—one may, in accordance with this method, perform a ritual of petition and offering to resolve them, thereby transforming misfortune into fortune, yielding great auspiciousness.\n\nIt is fitting to conduct this rite on the day of the *Tai Sui* (Great Year-Star), one’s *benming* (natal destiny), the *jiazi* (first day of the sexagenary cycle), the *gengshen* (57th day), or other propitious days, making offerings to beseech the *Siming* (Controller of Destinies) and the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper to deliver one from calamity.\n\nThe required items may be adjusted according to one’s means, whether rich or modest. Below is a provisional enumeration:\n\n**Permanent Ritual Implements (may be borrowed for repeated use):**\n- Six clean mats\n- One small table\n- Six incense burners\n- Twenty-four lacquered trays (with lids)\n- Forty-nine oil lamps, with forty-nine lamp stands (each three *chi* and five *cun* in length, used at night only)\n- Five segments of colored silk (each eight *chi* or longer)\n- Five segments of blue silk (each eight *chi* or longer; cloth or silk may be used as needed, or twenty-four sheets of paper)\n- Two small brooms\n- Twelve altar ropes (each one *zhang* and two *chi* long)\n- Twenty-four *zhang* of red thread for the altar railings (used by day only)\n- One bronze hand-bell\n- One large tray\n\n**Consumable Offerings (to be fully distributed upon completion of the rite):**\n- Forty-eight dried jujubes\n- Forty-eight chestnuts\n- Forty-eight seasonal fruits (of varied types)\n- Forty-eight *nian tou* (twisted dough offerings)\n- Forty-eight *butuo* (steamed buns)\n- Forty-eight assorted pastries (of varied types)\n- Three *dou* of glutinous millet, with rice mixed in (forty-eight portions of varied types)\n- One *liang* of incense\n- Half a *dou* of salt\n- One *dou* of fermented beans\n- Oil for forty-nine lamps, with wicks (used at night only)\n\n- One bowl of pure water\n\n**Adjustable Offerings (to be determined at the time of the rite, then distributed):**\n- A hand towel (three *chi* and five *cun* in length; cloth may be used)\n- Silk or cloth (color determined by the *nayin* [sound-element] of one’s natal destiny)\n- One thousand two hundred *wen* of \"stabilizing coins\"\n- One *shi* and two *dou* of \"destiny rice\"\n- One *chi* of silk per year of age, plus one extra\n\nPurple silk is the finest; otherwise, the color should correspond to the *nayin* of one’s natal destiny.\n\n**Ritual Method:**\nThe rite may be performed in a courtyard, a quiet place, or within a chamber. Construct an altar platform (*tanchang*) measuring two *zhang* and four *chi* on each side, with four cardinal gates, each four *chi* wide. Erect three layers of railings, inscribing the gates as follows:\n- East: *Qingyang* (Azure Yang) Gate\n- South: *Zhuming* (Vermilion Brightness) Gate\n- West: *Haoyin* (White Yin) Gate\n- North: *Xuanying* (Mysterious Prosperity) Gate\n\nWithin, arrange mats according to the five directions.\n\n**Alternative Method:**\nOmit the railings and instead encircle the altar with three-colored silk.\n\nPlace one mat five *chi* outside the southern gate.\n\n**Seating Arrangements:**\n- The officiant’s seat: one incense table, draped with a cloth. Alternatively, five incense tables may be placed in the five directions.\n- On the altar:\n  - East mat: Five Emperors, five trays, five portions\n  - South mat: Three Spirits, three trays, three portions\n  - West mat: Three Terraces, three trays, three portions\n  - North mat: Six *Jia* (celestial stems), six trays, six portions\n  - Central mat: Seven Stars, seven trays, seven portions\n\nPlace salt to the left and fermented beans to the right. Set the pure water on a small table, and arrange the rice and silk on the incense tables. The seating for the deities descends in rank according to their stations. Spread silk mats as seats for the gods, with purple as the highest, followed by red, green, blue, yellow, and white.\n\nBefore the silk, lay out blue cloth as a dining mat, upon which the trays are stacked. Gold and silver vessels are finest, followed by bronze, lacquered, and miscellaneous vessels.\n\nPlace twelve lamps around the altar (one per *chi* of its perimeter), each three *chi* and five *cun* high. One lamp before the officiant’s table, two *chi* and one *cun* high. The officiant and assistants enter and exit through the eastern gate. First, arrange the stabilizing objects; then burn incense; then present the food trays. If performing the incense procession, begin at the western end of the central mat, proceeding in order to the east, south, west, and north.\n\nThe disciple stands to the east of the altar, while the officiant faces north and strikes the bell thirty-six times. Stand evenly, calm the mind, and maintain silence, ceasing all noise and clamor. Visualize the Four Celestial Animals and the Jade Boys and Jade Maidens standing in attendance to left and right.\n\nThen, knock the teeth three times and invoke:\n*\"Great Supreme, Mysterious Origin, Five Numinous Venerable Lords, summon the Merit-Officials and Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Incense-Bearing Messengers, the Three Black Orthodox Deities. Urgently ascend to report to the Three Heavens’ Great Supreme, Mysterious Origin Dao Lord: Your servant now burns incense and establishes this offering, beseeching the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper and the Lords of the Five Emperors to dispel calamity and entreat fortune. May the vital *qi* of the Eight Directions’ true perfected ones enter my body. Let this petition swiftly ascend to the presence of the Great Supreme Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven.\"*\n\nNext, kneel and invoke the deities:\n*\"On this day of the [reign title] year, month, and [sexagenary] day, your servant [Name] bows his head and prostrates himself, reverently inviting:*\n*The First Star of the Northern Dipper, the Star of Greed-Wolf;*\n*The Second Star, the Star of Great Gate;*\n*The Third Star, the Star of Wealth-Store;*\n*The Fourth Star, the Star of Literary Brilliance;*\n*The Fifth Star, the Star of Integrity-Chastity;*\n*The Sixth Star, the Star of Martial Brilliance;*\n*The Seventh Star, the Star of Army-Destruction—*\n*May the Seven Stars’ True Lords, each leading their retinues, descend to the central mat and partake of this offering.*\n\n*Reverently inviting the Upper Cauldron Lords of the Three Terraces and Six Stars, each leading their retinues, to descend to the western mat and partake of this offering.*\n\n*Reverently inviting the Nine-*qi *Lord of the Azure Emperor of the East;*\n*The Three-*qi *Lord of the Vermilion Emperor of the South;*\n*The Seven-*qi *Lord of the White Emperor of the West;*\n*The Five-*qi *Lord of the Black Emperor of the North;*\n*The One-*qi *Lord of the Yellow Emperor of the Center—*\n*May the Five Directional Emperors, each leading their retinues, descend to the eastern mat and partake of this offering.*\n\n*Reverently inviting the Venerable Deities of the Southern Office—Controller of Destinies, Recorder of Deeds, Prolonger of Lifespan, Bestower of Longevity, and Deliverer from Calamity—each leading their retinues, to descend to the southern mat and partake of this offering.\"*\n\nReverently inviting the Six Jia and Six Xun Kings, Wang Wenqing and the sixty yin-yang deities, along with their attendant officials, generals, clerks, jade maidens, and all spirits, to descend to the northern mat and partake of this offering.\n\nThe master prostrates to meditate upon the deities, then rises from his seat and bows twice again.\n\nNext, incense is offered.\nTea is presented.\nThe initial offering is made.\n\nSupplicating the Seven Stars, the Five Emperors, the Three Terraces, the Deities of Destiny, the Six Jia, and all gods: may they deign to descend and partake of this offering.\n\nNow, for the prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, the official rank, name, age, birth month, and natal *jiazi* of the petitioner—this deity, Wang Wenqing, accompanied by eighteen attending officials, belongs to the First Star of the Northern Dipper, Greedy Wolf, styled \"Dew Spirit Child,\" born in the mortal realm, whose many deeds have often transgressed, lacking the fortune to avert calamity. Thus, he has prolonged his sorrows, his every movement filled with dread, his heart restless and uneasy. He fears that this year and this very month, he may be beset by all manner of misfortunes—converging deaths, encroaching punishments, the entanglement of the Eight Difficulties, the afflictions of the Seven Harms, malevolent spirits plotting disaster, and venomous ghosts stirring misfortune. Should he suffer even a single day of such woes, there would be no means of deliverance. His plea is earnest, his distress profound, and his plight truly pitiable.\n\nOn this auspicious and propitious day, at this place, the petition is humbly presented in the central courtyard, following the rites with utmost reverence. With purified grain, colored silk, offering coins, ritual objects, and incense, a memorial is respectfully submitted beneath the Northern Dipper, before the assembled spirits, in devotion to the stellar officials. His heart laid bare before the celestial courts, he presents this modest offering, his sincerity as deep as the cinnabar hue of devotion. May the true deities descend to this rite, bestow grace, and accept his life’s entreaty.\n\nShould there be many petitioners, their names, ages, and zodiac signs are respectfully listed as follows.\n\nThe disciple bows twice again.\n\nNext, incense is offered.\nThe second offering is made.\n\nAgain invoking the assembled Perfected Ones, he humbly beseeches with earnest devotion, imploring their numinous protection. May they deign to dissolve for him all calamities of body and fate in this year and the next.\n\nMay the green pestilence and green disasters of the East be dispelled—the trials of the Wood phase in the three months of spring.\nMay the red pestilence and red disasters of the South be dispelled—the trials of the Fire phase in the three months of summer.\nMay the white pestilence and white disasters of the West be dispelled—the trials of the Metal phase in the three months of autumn.\nMay the black pestilence and black disasters of the North be dispelled—the trials of the Water phase in the three months of winter.\nMay the yellow pestilence and yellow disasters of the Center be dispelled—the trials of the Earth phase in the intercalary months of the four seasons.\nMay the afflictions of his fate-year, natal palace, and the clashes of the Five Phases with sun and moon in the Nine Palaces be dispelled.\nMay the misfortunes of all karmic retributions, the Three Punishments of Jupiter, the Six Harms, and the Five Nets of destiny be dispelled.\nMay the calamities of ill-fated journeys—encounters with disaster and misfortune, unfulfilled desires, thwarted endeavors, meager harvests, and silkworms that fail to thrive—be dispelled.\nMay the perils of bandits, raiders, and violent plunder—loss of wealth and ruinous extortion—be dispelled.\nMay the entanglements of official and private disputes, imprisonment, shackles, and the snares of law and decree be dispelled.\nMay the scourges of seasonal epidemics—malaria, wind-stroke, a thousand illnesses, ten thousand pains, and mortal peril—be dispelled.\nMay the dangers of warfare, blade and arrow, treacherous mountains and rivers, and drowning be dispelled.\nMay the malevolent influences of the newly dead and long-departed in all directions and hours—hostile spirits, piercing arrows, and destructive forces—be dispelled.\nMay the threats of tigers, wolves, venomous snakes, dragons, wasps, scorpions, and poisonous stings be dispelled.\nMay all misfortunes be utterly dissolved.\n\nShould the snares of Heaven’s Net press down, the coils of Earth’s Web entangle, the Six Spirits turn malevolent, the Nine Inauspicious omens bring disaster, or baneful forces strike—should clashes, ruptures, or collisions arise, should the year’s fate be exhausted and its tally spent, and the weight of calamity be profound—then may the Celestial Officials reverse their boundless decree, bestow the grace of cloud and rain, and in their mercy, gaze upon his crimson sincerity. May they swiftly dissolve his misfortunes, melt his woes like ice, so that withered trees may flourish anew and decayed bones be moistened with life. May all receive the radiant protection of the sagely and luminous, the profound shelter of their grace.\n\nIf presenting a memorial, he then declares: *\"Your servant now humbly offers this petition, one document, to be heard by the Celestial Bureaus. May the attending Merit-Officer and messengers swiftly convey it. Humbly beseeching the august deities to regard and attend to it.\"*\n\nThe disciple bows twice again and respectfully submits.\n\nNext, the libations are scattered, the offerings are shared, and the officials are dismissed.\nThe memorial is concluded.\nAgain, incense is offered.\n\n**Final Offering**\n\nAgain, the disciple reverently invokes the radiant stars of the Northern Dipper, the Three Terraces, the Five Emperors, the Deities of Destiny and Records, the Six Jia spirits, and all gods: with utmost sincerity, he humbly entreats the luminous and sagely ones. Though the ritual mat is tainted and the offerings meager, he dares to trouble the august deities, beseeching them to descend in their cloud-borne chariots, bestow grace with compassionate regard, and extend their boundless blessings to all living beings. In particular, he implores that the profound waves of their mercy wash over him, dissolving his thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults, rectifying his dreams and visions, eradicating calamities and misfortunes. May the Northern Dipper avert death, the Southern Palace inscribe life, the true numina of the Five Emperors lend their protection, and the divine officers of the Six Jia ever uphold and sustain him.\n\nMay all obstacles dissolve, all endeavors prosper:\n- For those in office: may ranks ascend, positions elevate, governance spread like wind, authority command awe like frost, celestial emoluments endure, and imperial favor abide. May crimson and purple robes exude fragrance, and humble achievements shine forth.\n- For those at home: may dwellings be serene, households safe, halls filled with gold and jade, wealth flow in harmony, the Five Dragons guard, the Six Wastages cease, sons and daughters be virtuous and wise, and gates flourish in prosperity.\n- For those on the Dao: may the Six Penetrations reach afar, the Four Attainments attain perfection, wisdom and practice support one another, and numinous power be unobstructed. May names be inscribed on jade registers and golden tablets, and all beings revere and honor them, as humans and heavens alike pay homage.\n- For the afflicted: may suffering swiftly ease, the five viscera harmonize, the hundred passages flow freely, ghosts vanish, poisons disperse, cold fade, heat subside, the Four Great Elements restore balance, and the Six Bowels attain clarity.\n\nThus, the disciple humbly declares: *\"Overwhelmed by the boundless wisdom and power of the luminous deities, I beseech your vast shelter and receive your great grace.\"* He bows twice and respectfully submits.\n\n**Proclamation of the Petition**\n**Sending Forth the Deities**\n\nAs the gods descend in revered procession, responding to devotion in but a moment, the rites of gratitude are complete, the incense offerings concluded. Gods rejoice, the disciple is joyful, their lingering presence graces the entire feast. Yet the cloud chariots prepare their reins, the feathered carriages hesitate—time passes swiftly, and none dare delay. The celestial officials of the upper realms ascend their palatial thrones; the earthly deities below return to their posts. All that has been prayed and petitioned is faithfully transcribed within the memorial. May the deities deign to accept and heed these supplications. As they mount their chariots, may their benevolence abide. The disciple and his companions bow twice and reverently send forth the divine procession.\n\n**Replenishing the Incense Burner**\n\nThe Incense Officer and the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Attendant Incense Bearers—may they cause the ritual altar to naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar essence, and sacred mushrooms, their fragrant vapors wafting forth. May the hundred spirits gather before the incense burner, so that after this rite, the disciple’s disasters dissolve, his misfortunes pass, and he receive blessings and grace. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions guard the incense smoke, conveying his petition directly to the august presence of the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven.\n\n**Conclusion of the Rite**\n\nWhen the proceedings are complete, the master of ceremonies takes his natal star chart, bows twice, and consumes the remaining auspicious offerings. The lower offering tray is designated for the Earth God; one tray may also be placed outside the altar.\n\nThe Rite of the Orthodox Unity Tradition for Dissolving Misfortune is now concluded.",

Thus, he has prolonged his sorrows, his every movement filled with dread, his heart restless and uneasy. He fears that this year and this very month, he may be beset by all manner of misfortunes—converging deaths, encroaching punishments, the entanglement of the Eight Difficulties, the afflictions of the Seven Harms, malevolent spirits plotting disaster, and venomous ghosts stirring misfortune. Should he suffer even a single day of such woes, there would be no means of deliverance. His plea is earnest, his distress profound, and his plight truly pitiable.\n\nOn this auspicious and propitious day, at this place, the petition is humbly presented in the central courtyard, following the rites with utmost reverence. With purified grain, colored silk, offering coins, ritual objects, and incense, a memorial is respectfully submitted beneath the Northern Dipper, before the assembled spirits, in devotion to the stellar officials. His heart laid bare before the celestial courts, he presents this modest offering, his sincerity as deep as the cinnabar hue of devotion. May the true deities descend to this rite, bestow grace, and accept his life’s entreaty.\n\nShould there be many petitioners, their names, ages, and zodiac signs are respectfully listed as follows.\n\nThe disciple bows twice again.\n\nNext, incense is offered.\nThe second offering is made.",

      "translated_text": "**Final Offering**\n\nAgain, the disciple reverently invokes the radiant stars of the Northern Dipper, the Three Terraces, the Five Emperors, the Deities of Destiny and Records, the Six Jia spirits, and all gods: with utmost sincerity, he humbly entreats the luminous and sagely ones. Though the ritual mat is tainted and the offerings meager, he dares to trouble the august deities, beseeching them to descend in their cloud-borne chariots, bestow grace with compassionate regard, and extend their boundless blessings to all living beings. In particular, he implores that the profound waves of their mercy wash over him, dissolving his thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults, rectifying his dreams and visions, eradicating calamities and misfortunes. May the Northern Dipper avert death, the Southern Palace inscribe life, the true numina of the Five Emperors lend their protection, and the divine officers of the Six Jia ever uphold and sustain him.\n\nMay all obstacles dissolve, all endeavors prosper:\n- For those in office: may ranks ascend, positions elevate, governance spread like wind, authority command awe like frost, celestial emoluments endure, and imperial favor abide. May crimson and purple robes exude fragrance, and humble achievements shine forth.\n- For those at home: may dwellings be serene, households safe, halls filled with gold and jade, wealth flow in harmony, the Five Dragons guard, the Six Wastages cease, sons and daughters be virtuous and wise, and gates flourish in prosperity.\n- For those on the Dao: may the Six Penetrations reach afar, the Four Attainments attain perfection, wisdom and practice support one another, and numinous power be unobstructed. May names be inscribed on jade registers and golden tablets, and all beings revere and honor them, as humans and heavens alike pay homage.\n- For the afflicted: may suffering swiftly ease, the five viscera harmonize, the hundred passages flow freely, ghosts vanish, poisons disperse, cold fade, heat subside, the Four Great Elements restore balance, and the Six Bowels attain clarity.\n\nThus, the disciple humbly declares: *\"Overwhelmed by the boundless wisdom and power of the luminous deities, I beseech your vast shelter and receive your great grace.\"* He bows twice and respectfully submits.\n\n**Proclamation of the Petition**\n**Sending Forth the Deities**\n\nAs the gods descend in revered procession, responding to devotion in but a moment, the rites of gratitude are complete, the incense offerings concluded. Gods rejoice, the disciple is joyful, their lingering presence graces the entire feast. Yet the cloud chariots prepare their reins, the feathered carriages hesitate—time passes swiftly, and none dare delay. The celestial officials of the upper realms ascend their palatial thrones; the earthly deities below return to their posts. All that has been prayed and petitioned is faithfully transcribed within the memorial. May the deities deign to accept and heed these supplications. As they mount their chariots, may their benevolence abide. The disciple and his companions bow twice and reverently send forth the divine procession.\n\n**Replenishing the Incense Burner**\n\nThe Incense Officer and the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Attendant Incense Bearers—may they cause the ritual altar to naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar essence, and sacred mushrooms, their fragrant vapors wafting forth. May the hundred spirits gather before the incense burner, so that after this rite, the disciple’s disasters dissolve, his misfortunes pass, and he receive blessings and grace. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions guard the incense smoke, conveying his petition directly to the august presence of the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven.\n\n**Conclusion of the Rite**\n\nWhen the proceedings are complete, the master of ceremonies takes his natal star chart, bows twice, and consumes the remaining auspicious offerings. The lower offering tray is designated for the Earth God; one tray may also be placed outside the altar.\n\nThe Rite of the Orthodox Unity Tradition for Dissolving Misfortune is now concluded.",
