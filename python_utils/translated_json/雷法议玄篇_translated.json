  "full_translation": "**\"The Mysterious Treatise on Thunder Method**\n*Composed by Master Yuan Lu, the True Teacher of the Ten Thousand Schools*\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Mysterious Treatise on Thunder Method*\n*Composed by Master Yuan Lu and others of the Song Dynasty*\n*One scroll*\n*Source text: The Orthodox Daoist Canon (正统道藏), Canon One (正一部)*\n\nIn days past, I encountered my Master upon the Dragon Mountain heights, by the banks of the Fragrant Stream. There, I heard the teachings of the **Hun Yuan Tai Yi Dao**—the sacred texts of the Five Thunders to subdue malevolence. These were compiled into twenty-four sections, divided into three volumes—upper, middle, and lower. Within them were over two hundred chapters of talismans, diagrams, seals, incantations, and ritual formulas. The swift ascents, the footing of the cosmic dance, the structuring of seals and inscriptions—how could one enumerate their full scope?\n\nAfter repeated study, I told my Master: *\"This is the very source of the Dao’s boundless sea!\"*\n\nI had heard that the **Dao supreme is unencumbered**, and the **Law most concise**. Though these sacred texts are vast, even a balding scholar like me could not transcribe them fully.\n\nThe Master said: *\"You may swear by Heaven before I impart the swift and wondrous method.\"*\n\nThe disciple replied: *\"If Your Benevolence grants me the profound mysteries of the Primordial Mysterious, I would cut flesh as incense and sever my hair as an oath—what fear could I have?\"*\n\nThen, from his hidden satchel, the Master produced a small volume and, swearing by Heaven, transmitted it to me. The talismans, seals, incantations, and formulas—no more than thirty chapters—were all to be committed to heart by memory.\n\nThe Master said: *\"The most profound is the most simple; its wonder lies in these words.\"*\n\nAnd further: *\"Have you heard of the Thirty-Six Celestial Powers?\"*\n\nSpeaking of the **Dao supreme**, the **Qian Yuan Zhen Yi**—*Qian* being Yang, the **Dan Ling Zhen Yi qi**—when **Yuan Shi** first manifested his transformation, the **Pi Luo** condensed into boundless vastness. It took form as pavilions, as gates, as palaces, as halls—**thirty-six qi** coalescing into Heaven. Heaven is the progenitor of all things; thus, it takes form from Heaven, and its visage from the Dao.\n\nHow much more so for those who cultivate the True Way, seeking immortality and longevity, to align with Heaven’s years! Without mastering the **Thirty-Six Qi’s mysteries**, how could one harmonize with the Dao, ride the dragons, and wield the lightning?\n\nUpon hearing this, I understood how the Dao’s creation and the Law’s orchestration converge in singular principle.\n\nAs for the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, arrayed in the Four Directions, they are the **True Sovereign’s Great Emperor’s** grand deployment. The **Yellow Court’s Inner Palace**, with its **six times six**—the **Central Dipper’s Great Marshal** overseeing all spirits—assists the Celestial Sovereign’s transformations, governs cosmic cycles, and wields supreme authority. Within, the **Spiritual Officers and Ministers** hold their ranks, heeding the True Sovereign’s commands.\n\nTake, for instance: the **Ji Star** commands the wind, the **Bi Star** the rain, the **Mao Star** the clear skies, the **Xu and Wei Stars** the snow. The **Wo Constellation** governs the thunder. The winds, rains, snows, hail, lightning, and thunderclaps—each has its master.\n\nThe **Wei Star’s radiance**, the **Mighty Generals’ poisoned thunders**—all reside within the **Thirty-Six Vajra Qi**, beneath the **One Hundred Seventy-Nine Stars**, which are the **Chief Stars** overseeing all. The **Great Vajra’s authority** is foremost; what deity could resist?\n\nThough the **Thunder God** is fierce, all obey his command. Alongside the **Celestial Stars’ brilliance**, the **Swift Generals and Mighty Spirits**, they move with the qi in ceaseless rotation, day and night.\n\nFor their movements have measure, their halts have order. Without knowing these measures, how could one achieve response?\n\nOnly those who penetrate the **darkest mysteries**, who grasp the **Dao’s most hidden mechanisms**, could comprehend the **Wei Star’s radiance** and its movements.\n\nFor instance, on **Jia-Yi days at Wu-hour**, when praying for rain—where does the **Bi Star** reside? Even if one knows its precise location, how would one **command and subdue** it?\n\nThus, the military treatise *The Theory of Elusive Armies* states: *\"First, clarify the True Numbers of Tai Yi, to observe the stars’ auspicious and inauspicious omens. In battle, one must open the **Gate of Rest and Life** to secure the Dao’s path.\"*\n\nFor example, on **Bing-Ding days at Wei-hour**, where are the **Gate of Rest and Life**? Those who grasp this decide victories a thousand *li* away; those who falter cannot move a single step.\n\nAs for **Yin-Yang Wind-Water** masters selecting years and months for construction—sages who discern auspiciousness avoid calamity, while those who perceive the **auspicious stars** bring blessings and prosperity.\n\nThis is the **secret knowledge of stellar mechanisms**, the **divine application of mysteries**—all distilled into one grasp. How could it be in vain display or verbose ritual?\n\nThus, my Master, **Lord Wang Gong**, who served at the **Divine Court’s side**, once moved the **wind and rain at the Emperor’s command**. This was no mere trick of the hand—what else could it be?\n\nTruly, its efficacy was proven time and again.\n\nThe practitioners of Dao must first comprehend the **Yin-Yang stellar killings**, the **convergence and collision of qi**, and delve into the **intimate mechanisms of the Supreme Sovereign** and the **Primordial Emperor’s jade decrees** before any efficacy can be achieved.\n\nThus, the **thunderous mechanisms of transformation** surpass all ancient and modern arts. The **exiled immortals** of past dynasties merely passed this knowledge by word of mouth, unable to record it in writing.\n\nTherefore, the **Supreme Secret Precepts** state:\n*\"Loosen the hair, tread the *Gang* lines to seek the killing qi,\nBrandish the sword’s tip to ignite the fire and reveal the **True Scripture**.\"*\nThis is called the **True Scripture**.\n\nIt was when the **True King of the Sovereign** existed before the **Ming Hun** had yet to divide, in the **Flying Mysterious Realm** above, that he spread the **Buddha-qi** across the **Azure Sky and Purple Milky Way**, forming **Dragon Script and Phoenix Seals**, their radiance illuminating the **Four Directions**, shaking the **Six Extremes**. Then, he commanded the **Celestial Sovereign True Person** to follow the pattern and write the **Scripture**.\n\nThe **Primordial Emperor** at the **Dragon Yang Bright Palace** bestowed it upon the True King, while the rest was sealed and stored in the **Dragon Palace’s Ocean Treasury**, eternally governing the world. The **Law’s decrees** are countless in stages, but **Thunder** is the swiftest among them.\n\nYet, later disciples—with lofty hearts and sharp qi, but shallow practice and frivolous words—though they encounter a true master, who among them can truly fathom its mysteries? Thus, they have never heard of the **palm’s essential strategies**, nor have they ever seen the **True Scripture** on the blade. Their efforts yield little, their responses are ineffectual, and they abandon the path midway, blaming the Dao and their teachers. This is the fault of those who misdeliver the method, harming later disciples.\n\nHow could they not realize that without penetrating the **Law’s source**, they merely receive the **true teacher’s transmission**? Those who possess the **worldly-transmitted Fire-True Form** and **Thunder Lord’s True Aspect** only compound errors in myriad ways, confusing the **Primordial Truth**. Not only do they fail to achieve results in their own time, but they also invite ridicule from both humans and spirits.\n\nAs for the **Great Incantation of the Woodly Lord**, even those who fully possess it still find it wondrous. Even if they do, how could they craft the **secret essence of the Talisman’s transformation**? Moreover, they do not understand the **first phrase of the mechanism**: *\"The Heavenly Luster shines over the Jade Pool in the East.\"* This phrase is inscribed between the **Thunder Lord’s crown and soles**; how could one arrange the seal upon it?\n\nAs for the **Thunder Lord’s Sacred Image**, the **Sudden Fire True Form**, straddling a dragon below, holding a mallet in hand—each word is a transformation, each character clear and structured. The rest of the talismans are largely like this.\n\nFor instance, when establishing an altar to pray for rain, if the **Dragon Pool** is a hundred *li* away from the altar, one must use the **Inverted Sea Talisman** and personally deliver it. Even if there is efficacy, it is already the **second mechanism**.\n\nBut my true master was not so. First, on the **Mysterious Altar**, he summoned the **Functionary Official** with a talisman. When the official arrived, he presented a talisman to summon the **Thunder Lord** of a certain place. When the Thunder Lord arrived, he held a talisman to summon the **Dragon Spirit** of a certain place. When the Dragon Spirit arrived, the winds arose, clouds gathered, lightning flashed, and thunder roared—all according to the method. With a single command, rain fell immediately. This method is said to be **most wondrous**, yet my master still considered it **verbose ritual**, not the most immediate response.\n\nWhen I encountered a plea for rain, I merely inscribed a talisman on an **iron strip**, struck it, and cast it toward the **Bi Constellation**. According to the precept, it flew and presented itself—with a single command, rain fell. This is truly **most profound and wondrous**.\n\nAs for the method of **striking and subduing evil shrines**, the response should be immediate. My master’s precepts state:\n*\"When calamities plague life and death, and the crime warrants destruction, first locate the **Golden Tiger Great Killing** and the **Fiery Malevolent Star** among the **Twenty-Four Positions**. Determine where they fall today, this month, and this hour. Once the direction is fixed, use the **Thunder-Fire Talisman** to incite it. That star belongs to **Metal**, this talisman to **Fire**—Metal and Fire counteract each other, and the evil shrine is immediately destroyed.\"*\n\nAh! The **Heavenly Treasures and Mysterious Decrees**—jewel-like and secret. If one does not encounter a **strange adept** who personally transmits the **true master’s oral precepts**, one will spend a lifetime in vain pursuit.\n\nEven ordinary practitioners who summon thunder must first report to the **Supreme Sovereign**, then seek retribution, and only then act. Generally, **driving away evil, curing diseases, dispelling poison, and subduing demons** is like **rescuing a burning head**. If one waits for the **Supreme Sovereign’s command**, how is it like **harmonizing sounds for aid**, taking slow steps to extinguish flames? How could one wait so long?\n\nThus, the **True King’s teachings** say:\n*\"The **Thunderous Jade Treasury** is the domain of the **Five Thunder Departments**, which, under the **Supreme Sovereign’s command**, reward the good and punish the evil, acting with **convenient authority**.\"*\n\nTherefore, my master, **Lord Wang Tai-Su**, obtained the **True King’s principle of convenient authority**. Only those with **numinous bones** could encounter him, and only those of **ferocious loyalty and filial piety** could uphold it. Moreover, mastering even one aspect of the **Law** is the swiftest path to **perfecting the Dao**. Without **divine completeness**, how could one command ghosts and spirits to save the critically ill?\n\nThus, the **Ancestral Master**, with the **Primordial One’s true qi**, transformed into the **Countless Great Generals**, annihilating the **Six Heavenly Demons**, accumulating merit and virtue, and ascending to the **Golden Gate of the Celestial Court**.\n\nTherefore, those who practice the Dao must not **create false forms that return to ruin**, must not **accumulate negative merit and fail to reach the Mysterious Realm**, must not **refine essence and spirit without purity and joy**, and must not **save the suffering without achieving Daoist fruition**.\n\nAll who seek immortality and the Dao must **serve the nation and save the people, promote benefits and eliminate harm, be upright and intelligent, diligent in incense and offerings, atone for the sins of the Nine Mysterious and Seven Ancestral Teachers, and absolve the offenses of a thousand kalpas and a hundred ages**. If fortunate enough to encounter teachers and friends, do not betray their trust—**ascension awaits**. If one violates the **Mysterious Laws**, one will sink into the **Sea of Suffering**. Devote oneself wholeheartedly, and the responses will come like echoes. Later disciples, do not neglect this.\n\nThe **Thunder Method’s profound ocean** is now fully expounded.\n\nIn ancient times, practitioners of the Dao **moved things with their hearts** and **governed evil with righteousness**. A righteous heart made all spirits responsive, and a pure body drove away all evils. As time passed, the **original teachings degenerated**, and thus **doctrines and methods were established to subdue ghosts**, using **talismans and techniques to summon spirits**.\n\nThe **Thunder**—this phenomenon—is indeed the **Heavenly Command**, the convergence of the **Yin-Yang dual qi**. When still, it rests; when stirred, it roars. Born in the **Zhen Constellation**, arising from the **Xun Gate**, it does not strike unless its time comes, with **Divine Agents** overseeing it.\n\nYet among those who follow the **Dao**, some **invoke Thunder by law**, others **borrow Thunder by law**—truly, their claims may well be seen as **earthshaking and world-upsetting**. Now, as for the **True Performance Method**—where did its doctrine originate? Ah, I know it well.\n\nWith **upright heart and sincere intent**, one aligns with **Heaven’s Way**, its depths unfathomable, vast as the sea. It unfurls the **True Dao** endlessly. Yet this alone does not reach the **Mystic Primordial’s subtlety** or grasp the **profound mechanisms**—it is insufficient to speak of this.\n\nNow, there are those who, through long practice of the **Supreme Law**, universally benefit the common folk. When they encounter a **Guiding Master** and receive the **rightful principles**, they act as **Heaven’s emissaries**, spreading the **True Teaching’s wind**. They grasp the **ancients’ intent** of **upright heart and divine resonance**, and with **Flying Gang and Treading Dou**, sealing seals and inscribing talismans—\n\nWhen the **heart’s incense burns**, when the **heart’s talisman glows**, their **commands resound**, and **ten thousand spirits obey**. They pinpoint the **Thunder Constellation’s alignment**, master the **Rain Master’s control**, and with a single **summons**, Thunder crashes; with a single **shout**, Rain arrives—**this calls, that responds**, as echoes do.\n\nYet those who **casually invoke Thunder**, failing to fathom its **maneuvering subtleties** or grasp its **summoning origins**, often cling to the **ancients’ husks**, recklessly discussing the **Dao’s profound depths**. Their **words contradict their deeds**, their **heart drifts with things**, eyes bulging, mouths gaping—**hollow shouts in panic**, yet **no response comes**. The gap between them and true mastery is **ten thousand leagues**.\n\nAs for the **Fire Master Wang Ruogu**, he **acted with True Sovereign authority**, barking commands that **Thunder and Lightning obeyed**, issuing decrees that **winds and rains answered**. He **preserved the Supreme Primordial’s essence**, **maintained the Pure and Substantial**, served **Heaven with fasting and purity**, and with **utter sincerity** moved **ghosts and spirits**. His **commands were precise**, his **rewards and punishments unerring**, his **demeanor reverent and harmonious**—**silently attuned to the Dao**, he **assisted Heaven in its transformations**, **aided the nation in its salvation**. Truly, who could say he fell short?\n\nNow, to **unfold the True Performance’s transformation**, one must first **transmit its authentic texts**. This is not merely for **superficial display**, but to **set a model for later disciples**. I dare not hoard it, thus I **engrave and print** this work to **broaden its dissemination**. May all **kindred spirits** not **neglect it with idle ears**.\n\nIn the **Song Dynasty’s Chunyou Eighth Year, Second Month, on the True Primordial Festival**, Ruogu of the **Hidden Valley** composed *On Invoking Thunder by Law*—the world praised it, yet few truly **grasped its mysteries**.\n\nFor the **True Performance’s work** is not for the **shallow-minded** to comprehend. Not only must one **speak of it**, but one must **wield it**—thus I do not withhold it.\n\n「Indeed, this is a great supplement for the future—no small benefit.\n\nWhen the Great Primordial (*Dàpò*) had not yet dispersed, **Yin** and **Yang** began to sprout.\nOnce the Two Principles (*Liǎngyí*) were established, the Eight Trigrams (*Bāguà*) were formed.\n**Thunder (Zhèn)** and **Wind (Xuān)** govern the winds and the peals.\nThrough **Water (shuǐ)** it transforms, by **Fire (huǒ)** it clarifies.\nIn **self-return (zìfù)**, it grows mighty—granting honor to the withered.\nAbove, it drives the **Celestial Mandate (tiān hào)**, below, it shapes the **physical forms (wù xíng)**.\nWho commands this power, to **summon at the proper time (yù)?\nIt emerges from the **Earth’s Gate (dì hù)**, reaching the **Imperial Court (dì tíng)**.\nThe **Pivot Hall (shū tái)** holds dominion, the **Daoist Essence (fán qì)** coalesces.\nOne, nine, yet three—its **numerical origin (shù zhào)** stems from **Jade Purity (Yùqīng)**.\nAll belong to the **Divine Tao’s Realm (Shénxiāo)**, fully recorded in the **Yü’s Classic (Yǔ Jīng)**.\nBy **Law (fǎ)**, it moves—none of its actions are trivial.\n\nIndeed, in ancient times, the teachings were passed down until the present.\nOnly the **most profound words (cí zhì xuān)** can restore the depths of obscurity.\nAs the world declined into vulgarity and thinness (*shì jiàng sú bó*), false and private doctrines arose.\nThey claim to be the **orthodox lineage (zōng tán)**, yet presumptuously **seize the Daoist ranks (xiān qīng)**.\nAsk of their practices—none match their empty names.\nThrough **erroneous transmission (wú)**, they receive more errors, **summoning disasters (jiā) and conscripting spirits (yì bīng)**.\nWhat they call **subtle and mysterious (wēimiào)**, is like the deaf hearing sounds—\nEven if some claim to know, their minds are **distracted and restless (tā xīn yíng yíng)**.\nThe **Heaven fears this Dao (tiān kǒng sī dào)** may be lost to oblivion,\nThus it entrusts its continuation to the **Pure White Field Master (Chúnbái Tián Jūn)**,\nAnd to the **Silent Cultivator of the Yellow Court (hē xiū Huáng Tíng)**.\nThe **forebearers of enlightenment (xiān jué zhī tú)** and the **heroes of later generations (hòu jìn zhī yīng)**,\nWith the **Purple Sovereign’s secret keys (Zǐhuáng mì jué)**, may **walk the straight path (zhí xíng)**.\nThey **delve into the primordial source (dòng jiū yuán běn)**, never **yielding to fame or gain (fú xún lì míng)**.\nOut of **compassion for the common folk (jiù sú wéi niàn)**, they **preserve and refine their practices (chí xí yán jīng)**.\nGazing downward at the **Five Directions (wǔ fāng)**, upward at the **celestial constellations (liè xīng)**,\nThey **grasp the essential threads (hóng lǐng yào kuò)** and **guide transformations without pause (wǔ xuán bù tíng)**.\nPraying for **clear skies (qí qíng)**, they receive **immediate response (xiàng yìng)**;\nTesting **cures (kǎo zhì)**, they bring **peace to ailments (huàn níng)**.\nThey do not seek **private virtue (dú shàn)**, but **guide and nurture allies (yòu yè tóng méng)**.\nThe *True Performance’s* writings **reveal the path to spiritual awakening (dá líng)**—\nThe **Law of Invoking Thunder (yùn léi zhī fǎ)** **unveils the ignorant and blind (huò kāi yū máng)**.\nIt should be **ranked with the Kings and Xue (Wáng Xuē)**, **listed among the Jade Capital’s worthies (Yáo Jīng)**.\nThose who **seek its true intent (néng qiú zhǐ qù)**, the **empty will be filled (xū zhě bì yíng)**.\n\nI observed its text and **uttered three sighs of astonishment (sān tàn shèn jīng)**.\nIts **thoroughness and clarity (shū qí bàn qià)**—how could praise be **too excessive (yù cí zhì qíng)**?\nA great supplement for the future, its fragrance will endure for **a hundred generations (bǎi shì fāng xīn)**.\nIt flows with the **Law (fǎ)**, like **cinnabar (dān)** and **emerald (qīng)**.\nWords cannot fully express its meaning—thus I **compose this eulogy (zàn ér lè míng)**.\n\n**Ode to Jade Purity (Yùqīng yín zēng shí àn xiānshēng):**\nWho among the Jade Purity lineage truly understands?\nThe **Primordial Mechanism’s hidden depths (yuán jī yǐn ào)** are hard to trace.\nHow few stages remain of its **heart-transmitted marvelous Law (miào fǎ xīn chuán cún)**—\nEven the **Eight Vehicles’ scholars (Bāshèng xuéshì)** know little of its resonance.\n\nThe **Thunder King’s true form (Chìtiān Dūléi shèng xiàng)** belongs to the **True Sovereign (Zhēn Wáng)**,\nThe **Sudden Fire Marshal (Hūhuǒ Dàjiàng)** resides in the **Hall of the Immortal (shè fáng)**.\nThe **Second and Third Heavens (chǒu wèi èr gōng)** hold **some minor mysteries (xiē’ér miào)**,\nThe **Second and Third Marshals (wèi niú èr jiàng)** serve the **Master beside (shì shī bàng)**.\nThis Law is **rarely known in the world (liú chuán shì hǎn zhī)**—\nHeaven fears this Dao may **soon collapse (jiāng qīng cuī)**.\nThe **Jade Treasury’s exiled immortal (Yù fǔ zhé xiān)**—Master Éng (Éng Zhēnshì),\n**Personally entrusted (qīn fù)** the **transformation’s mechanism (zào huà jī)** to **Master Hé (Hé Jūn)**.\nMaster Hé, having **mastered the Great Law (dà fǎ)**,\nNever strays from the **Ten Revolutions of the Circulating Heaven (Zhōutiān yī shí bā)**.\nHe **summons rain and clears skies by voice (qí qíng dǎo yǔ yìng shēng shēng)**,\n**Gathers and dispatches them back to feast beneath the moon (shōu shí guī lái fàn míng yuè)**.\nHe **commands the chamber to radiate brilliance (zuò lìng mǎn shì guāng huī shēng)**,\nThe **Primordial Pearl pierces straight through the Kunlun Mountains (yuán zhū zhí tòu gōng Kūnlún)**.\nWithin, a **babe holds the divine transformation (yīng’ér wò shén huà)**,\n**Riding a Fire Dragon to pay homage to the Celestial Master (jià gè huǒ lóng yè Dì Jūn)**.\n\n**Detailed Exposition on the Sudden Fire True Form:**\nThe **Venerable Master (Zōngshī)** of the *Discourse on the Mysterious (Yì Xuán Piān)* states:\nThe **traditionally transmitted Sudden Fire True Form (qīn huǒ zhēn xíng)**,\nThe **Thunder King’s talismans (Léi Gōng dān zhuàn)**,\nAre indeed **utterly erroneous and manifold in deception (shí wéi kuí wú wàn zhuàng)**,\n**Excessively chaotic with no order (fán luàn wú guī)**.\nNot only are they **ineffective in the present (wú xiào yú qiánmiàn)**,\nBut they **invite mockery from the spirits (shēn yǒu qǔ xiào yú shén guǐ)**.\nFor instance, the **Great Incantation of the Wood Marshal (Mù Láng Dà zhòu)**—\nEven if a **Daoist adept (fǎ jiā)** obtains its entirety, it is still wondrous yet flawed.\nEven if one **acquires its fullness (zòng dé qí bèi)**,\nHow could this incantation **serve as a means of transformation (zào huà)**?\nIts first line reads: *“The Heavenly Crystal flows radiance in the Eastern Pool of Jade (Qián jīng liú huī yù chí dōng).”*\nThis single line, **between the Thunder King’s crown and heel (tīng zuǎn jiān)**,\nIs **written with a stroke to generate its form (xià bǐ shēng chéng)**.\nWhat is the **Thunder King’s sacred visage (shèng xiàng)**?\nWhat is the **Sudden Fire True Form (huǒ zhēn xíng)**?\nBy **invoking its essence (dān zhuàn)**,\nIt **manifests beneath the Dragon Seat (kuà lóng zuò xià)**,\n**Wielding the Hammer in hand (zhí chuí shǒu zhōng)**.\nEach line **clearly delineates the path of transformation (zào huà fēn míng)**,\nEach character **forms with deliberate structure (zì zì shēng chéng yǒu gé)**—\nOther **authentic talismans and grand methods (zhēn zhuàn dà kuò)** are like this, as well.\n\nSince my youth (*crown year, guān nián*), after **studying the profound theories of the *Discourse on the Mysterious* (Yì Xuán Piān zhī ào lùn)**,\nI **diligently sought and inquired (zì zì cān fǎng, kǔ zhì xún qiú)**,\nThough I **repeatedly received guidance from teachers and peers (suī lèi méng shī yǒu zhǐ jiào)**,\nI **never aligned with the ancients’ intent (zhōng wèi hé xiān xiān zhī zōng zhǐ)**.\nIn the **year *Gěngchǒu* (gěngchǒu)**, while **dwelling in Jinling (Jīnlíng)**,\nI **suddenly encountered a marvel (yǒu yì yù)**—\nThe **secret canon (mì diǎn)** of Master Zēng (Zēngshī) from the **Yuanfēng era (Yuánfēng nián jiàn)**.\n\nHis family **treasured it across three generations (sān shì)**,\nDaring not to **disturb it recklessly (màng dòng)**—\nEven a **mistaken brush against its dust (wù shì fú qí chén)** would **bring calamity (zāi bàn suí zhì)**,\nFor it **awaits a destined one (yǒu suǒ dài ér rán)**.\nWhen I **received it (shòu zhī)**, I **burned incense and opened the scroll (fén xiāng kāi juàn)**,\nIts opening words: *“The Sudden Fire True Form, the Thunder King’s sacred visage—\nThe **method of generating and transforming divine power (shēngchéng biànhuà zhī dào)**,”*\nDispelled all **lifelong doubts (píngshēng suǒ yí, dùnrán bīng xiè)**—\n**Practicing it indeed bore strange and wondrous results (xíng zhī guǒ yǒu qí yàn)**.\nLater, I **taught a few successors (shì fǎ)**—\nYet none **truly grasped it (dé rén)**.\nNow, as I **approach old age (jiāng lǎo)**,\nIf I **do not transmit it (bù chuán)**, the **Heavenly Dao may be lost (mì tiān dào)**;\nIf I **transmit it (chuán zhī)**, it is **difficult to choose a worthy recipient (nán yú zé rén)**.\nSince the **expository treatise (xiáng lùn zhī shū)** is complete,\nI also **reveal a few genuine keys (lù zhēn jī yī èr)**,\nTo **guide those who follow (shì jiāng lái)**—\nThus they may **trace the source from its stream (xún liú zhī yuán)**,\nAnd **avoid being lost in obscurity (miǎn yān chén yú mì diǎn)**.\n\nIn **practicing and upholding (fán xíng chí)**,\nFirst, **one must cultivate the Primordial Ancestral Essence (xiān tiān zǔ qì)**,\nAnd **refine the Qi of one’s mortal body (diǎn huà yī shēn fán tāi zhī qì)**.\nThis **Primordial Ancestral Essence (xiān tiān zǔ qì)**,\nIs the **root of the Great Dao of Chaos (Hóngméng dà dào zhī běn)**—\nIt must be **sought before the division of the undifferentiated (hùn duàn wèi fēn yǐ qián)**,\nFor all **ten thousand Laws and myriad gates (wàn fǎ qiān mén)** begin here.\nIt is **not the turbid and impure Qi (huì zhuó zhī qì)** produced after **Parental union (fù mǔ gōng jīng yǐ hòu)**—\nThis was **detailed in the previous exposition (qián piān xiáng lùn zhī)**.\n\nOnce **the Ancestral Essence is obtained and infused into the body (dé zǔ qì rù shēn diǎn huà fán zhuó)**,\nThen **one may practice and uphold (rán hòu kě yǐ xíng chí)**.\nIn **inscribing talismans and casting spells (fán shū fū)**,\nFirst, **one must calculate the auspicious time (shēng wàng)**,\nThen, **enter the Chamber of Calmness (jìng shì)** to **summon Thunder and Peals (lèng chào léi tíng)**.\nTen thousand spirits **assemble and abide (lián zhù)**, filling the cosmos—\n**Naturally, the heavens darken and the earth’s Qi churns (tiān hūn dì qì)**.\nAs **the two Essences rise and fall (èr qì shēng jiàng)**,\nOnly then does **the form conceal and the body transform (zàng xíng biàn tǐ)**.\nThe **Five Essences interact (wǔ qì xiāng shēng)**—\nOne **generates from one (yī shēng yī)**, and the **sacred embryo forms (shèng tāi jié jiù)**.\nPractice the **Ten Revolutions of the Returning Soul’s supreme path (shàng dào)**,\nUniting the **Nine Heavens’ divine mechanism (xiān jī shēng shén huán jī)**,\nNext, **deploy the Ancestral Essence within the Three Scenes and the Great Void (sān jǐng tài kōng zhī zhōng)**,\n**Generate the Mysterious Female (Xuán pǐ)** at the **Primordial Soil’s position (xiān tiān zhēn tǔ zhī wèi)**,\n**Circulate the Primordial Essence of the Yellow Performance (yuán xiān yī huáng yǎn zhī qì)** ninefold,\n**Enfolding its vital thread

      "translated_text": "**\"The Mysterious Treatise on Thunder Method**\n*Composed by Master Yuan Lu, the True Teacher of the Ten Thousand Schools*\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Mysterious Treatise on Thunder Method*\n*Composed by Master Yuan Lu and others of the Song Dynasty*\n*One scroll*\n*Source text: The Orthodox Daoist Canon (正统道藏), Canon One (正一部)*\n\nIn days past, I encountered my Master upon the Dragon Mountain heights, by the banks of the Fragrant Stream. There, I heard the teachings of the **Hun Yuan Tai Yi Dao**—the sacred texts of the Five Thunders to subdue malevolence. These were compiled into twenty-four sections, divided into three volumes—upper, middle, and lower. Within them were over two hundred chapters of talismans, diagrams, seals, incantations, and ritual formulas. The swift ascents, the footing of the cosmic dance, the structuring of seals and inscriptions—how could one enumerate their full scope?\n\nAfter repeated study, I told my Master: *\"This is the very source of the Dao’s boundless sea!\"*\n\nI had heard that the **Dao supreme is unencumbered**, and the **Law most concise**. Though these sacred texts are vast, even a balding scholar like me could not transcribe them fully.\n\nThe Master said: *\"You may swear by Heaven before I impart the swift and wondrous method.\"*\n\nThe disciple replied: *\"If Your Benevolence grants me the profound mysteries of the Primordial Mysterious, I would cut flesh as incense and sever my hair as an oath—what fear could I have?\"*\n\nThen, from his hidden satchel, the Master produced a small volume and, swearing by Heaven, transmitted it to me. The talismans, seals, incantations, and formulas—no more than thirty chapters—were all to be committed to heart by memory.\n\nThe Master said: *\"The most profound is the most simple; its wonder lies in these words.\"*\n\nAnd further: *\"Have you heard of the Thirty-Six Celestial Powers?\"*\n\nSpeaking of the **Dao supreme**, the **Qian Yuan Zhen Yi**—*Qian* being Yang, the **Dan Ling Zhen Yi qi**—when **Yuan Shi** first manifested his transformation, the **Pi Luo** condensed into boundless vastness. It took form as pavilions, as gates, as palaces, as halls—**thirty-six qi** coalescing into Heaven. Heaven is the progenitor of all things; thus, it takes form from Heaven, and its visage from the Dao.\n\nHow much more so for those who cultivate the True Way, seeking immortality and longevity, to align with Heaven’s years! Without mastering the **Thirty-Six Qi’s mysteries**, how could one harmonize with the Dao, ride the dragons, and wield the lightning?\n\nUpon hearing this, I understood how the Dao’s creation and the Law’s orchestration converge in singular principle.\n\nAs for the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, arrayed in the Four Directions, they are the **True Sovereign’s Great Emperor’s** grand deployment. The **Yellow Court’s Inner Palace**, with its **six times six**—the **Central Dipper’s Great Marshal** overseeing all spirits—assists the Celestial Sovereign’s transformations, governs cosmic cycles, and wields supreme authority. Within, the **Spiritual Officers and Ministers** hold their ranks, heeding the True Sovereign’s commands.\n\nTake, for instance: the **Ji Star** commands the wind, the **Bi Star** the rain, the **Mao Star** the clear skies, the **Xu and Wei Stars** the snow. The **Wo Constellation** governs the thunder. The winds, rains, snows, hail, lightning, and thunderclaps—each has its master.\n\nThe **Wei Star’s radiance**, the **Mighty Generals’ poisoned thunders**—all reside within the **Thirty-Six Vajra Qi**, beneath the **One Hundred Seventy-Nine Stars**, which are the **Chief Stars** overseeing all. The **Great Vajra’s authority** is foremost; what deity could resist?\n\nThough the **Thunder God** is fierce, all obey his command. Alongside the **Celestial Stars’ brilliance**, the **Swift Generals and Mighty Spirits**, they move with the qi in ceaseless rotation, day and night.\n\nFor their movements have measure, their halts have order. Without knowing these measures, how could one achieve response?\n\nOnly those who penetrate the **darkest mysteries**, who grasp the **Dao’s most hidden mechanisms**, could comprehend the **Wei Star’s radiance** and its movements.\n\nFor instance, on **Jia-Yi days at Wu-hour**, when praying for rain—where does the **Bi Star** reside? Even if one knows its precise location, how would one **command and subdue** it?\n\nThus, the military treatise *The Theory of Elusive Armies* states: *\"First, clarify the True Numbers of Tai Yi, to observe the stars’ auspicious and inauspicious omens. In battle, one must open the **Gate of Rest and Life** to secure the Dao’s path.\"*\n\nFor example, on **Bing-Ding days at Wei-hour**, where are the **Gate of Rest and Life**? Those who grasp this decide victories a thousand *li* away; those who falter cannot move a single step.\n\nAs for **Yin-Yang Wind-Water** masters selecting years and months for construction—sages who discern auspiciousness avoid calamity, while those who perceive the **auspicious stars** bring blessings and prosperity.\n\nThis is the **secret knowledge of stellar mechanisms**, the **divine application of mysteries**—all distilled into one grasp. How could it be in vain display or verbose ritual?\n\nThus, my Master, **Lord Wang Gong**, who served at the **Divine Court’s side**, once moved the **wind and rain at the Emperor’s command**. This was no mere trick of the hand—what else could it be?\n\nTruly, its efficacy was proven time and again.",

      "translated_text": "The practitioners of Dao must first comprehend the **Yin-Yang stellar killings**, the **convergence and collision of qi**, and delve into the **intimate mechanisms of the Supreme Sovereign** and the **Primordial Emperor’s jade decrees** before any efficacy can be achieved.\n\nThus, the **thunderous mechanisms of transformation** surpass all ancient and modern arts. The **exiled immortals** of past dynasties merely passed this knowledge by word of mouth, unable to record it in writing.\n\nTherefore, the **Supreme Secret Precepts** state:\n*\"Loosen the hair, tread the *Gang* lines to seek the killing qi,\nBrandish the sword’s tip to ignite the fire and reveal the **True Scripture**.\"*\nThis is called the **True Scripture**.\n\nIt was when the **True King of the Sovereign** existed before the **Ming Hun** had yet to divide, in the **Flying Mysterious Realm** above, that he spread the **Buddha-qi** across the **Azure Sky and Purple Milky Way**, forming **Dragon Script and Phoenix Seals**, their radiance illuminating the **Four Directions**, shaking the **Six Extremes**. Then, he commanded the **Celestial Sovereign True Person** to follow the pattern and write the **Scripture**.\n\nThe **Primordial Emperor** at the **Dragon Yang Bright Palace** bestowed it upon the True King, while the rest was sealed and stored in the **Dragon Palace’s Ocean Treasury**, eternally governing the world. The **Law’s decrees** are countless in stages, but **Thunder** is the swiftest among them.\n\nYet, later disciples—with lofty hearts and sharp qi, but shallow practice and frivolous words—though they encounter a true master, who among them can truly fathom its mysteries? Thus, they have never heard of the **palm’s essential strategies**, nor have they ever seen the **True Scripture** on the blade. Their efforts yield little, their responses are ineffectual, and they abandon the path midway, blaming the Dao and their teachers. This is the fault of those who misdeliver the method, harming later disciples.\n\nHow could they not realize that without penetrating the **Law’s source**, they merely receive the **true teacher’s transmission**? Those who possess the **worldly-transmitted Fire-True Form** and **Thunder Lord’s True Aspect** only compound errors in myriad ways, confusing the **Primordial Truth**. Not only do they fail to achieve results in their own time, but they also invite ridicule from both humans and spirits.\n\nAs for the **Great Incantation of the Woodly Lord**, even those who fully possess it still find it wondrous. Even if they do, how could they craft the **secret essence of the Talisman’s transformation**? Moreover, they do not understand the **first phrase of the mechanism**: *\"The Heavenly Luster shines over the Jade Pool in the East.\"* This phrase is inscribed between the **Thunder Lord’s crown and soles**; how could one arrange the seal upon it?\n\nAs for the **Thunder Lord’s Sacred Image**, the **Sudden Fire True Form**, straddling a dragon below, holding a mallet in hand—each word is a transformation, each character clear and structured. The rest of the talismans are largely like this.\n\nFor instance, when establishing an altar to pray for rain, if the **Dragon Pool** is a hundred *li* away from the altar, one must use the **Inverted Sea Talisman** and personally deliver it. Even if there is efficacy, it is already the **second mechanism**.\n\nBut my true master was not so. First, on the **Mysterious Altar**, he summoned the **Functionary Official** with a talisman. When the official arrived, he presented a talisman to summon the **Thunder Lord** of a certain place. When the Thunder Lord arrived, he held a talisman to summon the **Dragon Spirit** of a certain place. When the Dragon Spirit arrived, the winds arose, clouds gathered, lightning flashed, and thunder roared—all according to the method. With a single command, rain fell immediately. This method is said to be **most wondrous**, yet my master still considered it **verbose ritual**, not the most immediate response.\n\nWhen I encountered a plea for rain, I merely inscribed a talisman on an **iron strip**, struck it, and cast it toward the **Bi Constellation**. According to the precept, it flew and presented itself—with a single command, rain fell. This is truly **most profound and wondrous**.\n\nAs for the method of **striking and subduing evil shrines**, the response should be immediate. My master’s precepts state:\n*\"When calamities plague life and death, and the crime warrants destruction, first locate the **Golden Tiger Great Killing** and the **Fiery Malevolent Star** among the **Twenty-Four Positions**. Determine where they fall today, this month, and this hour. Once the direction is fixed, use the **Thunder-Fire Talisman** to incite it. That star belongs to **Metal**, this talisman to **Fire**—Metal and Fire counteract each other, and the evil shrine is immediately destroyed.\"*\n\nAh! The **Heavenly Treasures and Mysterious Decrees**—jewel-like and secret. If one does not encounter a **strange adept** who personally transmits the **true master’s oral precepts**, one will spend a lifetime in vain pursuit.\n\nEven ordinary practitioners who summon thunder must first report to the **Supreme Sovereign**, then seek retribution, and only then act. Generally, **driving away evil, curing diseases, dispelling poison, and subduing demons** is like **rescuing a burning head**. If one waits for the **Supreme Sovereign’s command**, how is it like **harmonizing sounds for aid**, taking slow steps to extinguish flames? How could one wait so long?\n\nThus, the **True King’s teachings** say:\n*\"The **Thunderous Jade Treasury** is the domain of the **Five Thunder Departments**, which, under the **Supreme Sovereign’s command**, reward the good and punish the evil, acting with **convenient authority**.\"*\n\nTherefore, my master, **Lord Wang Tai-Su**, obtained the **True King’s principle of convenient authority**. Only those with **numinous bones** could encounter him, and only those of **ferocious loyalty and filial piety** could uphold it. Moreover, mastering even one aspect of the **Law** is the swiftest path to **perfecting the Dao**. Without **divine completeness**, how could one command ghosts and spirits to save the critically ill?\n\nThus, the **Ancestral Master**, with the **Primordial One’s true qi**, transformed into the **Countless Great Generals**, annihilating the **Six Heavenly Demons**, accumulating merit and virtue, and ascending to the **Golden Gate of the Celestial Court**.\n\nTherefore, those who practice the Dao must not **create false forms that return to ruin**, must not **accumulate negative merit and fail to reach the Mysterious Realm**, must not **refine essence and spirit without purity and joy**, and must not **save the suffering without achieving Daoist fruition**.\n\nAll who seek immortality and the Dao must **serve the nation and save the people, promote benefits and eliminate harm, be upright and intelligent, diligent in incense and offerings, atone for the sins of the Nine Mysterious and Seven Ancestral Teachers, and absolve the offenses of a thousand kalpas and a hundred ages**. If fortunate enough to encounter teachers and friends, do not betray their trust—**ascension awaits**. If one violates the **Mysterious Laws**, one will sink into the **Sea of Suffering**. Devote oneself wholeheartedly, and the responses will come like echoes. Later disciples, do not neglect this.\n\nThe **Thunder Method’s profound ocean** is now fully expounded.\n\nIn ancient times, practitioners of the Dao **moved things with their hearts** and **governed evil with righteousness**. A righteous heart made all spirits responsive, and a pure body drove away all evils. As time passed, the **original teachings degenerated**, and thus **doctrines and methods were established to subdue ghosts**, using **talismans and techniques to summon spirits**.",
