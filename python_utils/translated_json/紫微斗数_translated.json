Proceed accordingly.\n\n**Method for Locating Celestial Punishment**\nTo locate Celestial Punishment:\nBegin at *You* with the first month, count forward to the birth month to place Celestial Punishment.\n\n**Method for Locating Celestial Lament**\nTo locate Celestial Lament:\nAlign it with the palace that harmonizes with the birth year.\n*Example*: For one born in the year of *Zi*, which harmonizes with *Chou*, place the Lament at *Chou*.\n\n**Method for Locating Destiny**\nFrom the Staff Star, count forward to the native’s birth hour. If the birth hour is the Seal hour, begin at *Zi* with *Shen*, count forward to *Wei* to meet *Mao*—this is the Destiny Palace.\n\n**Method for Locating the Body**\nFrom the Staff, count in retrograde—one palace per two and a half days, two palaces per five days—until reaching the birth day to fix the Body, regardless of gender.\n*Example*: For the third, thirteenth, or twenty-third day, or the eighth, eighteenth, or twenty-eighth day, if the hour is *Wu*, it does not pass the palace; if *Wei*, it does.\n\n**Method for Locating the Major Limit**\nFor yang males and yin females, count forward from the Destiny Palace, one palace per decade.\nFor yin males and yang females, count in retrograde from the *Shen* Palace, one palace per decade.\n\n**Method for Locating the Minor Cycle**\nFor yang males and yin females, count in retrograde from the *Shen* Palace, one palace per year.\nFor yin males and yang females, count forward from the Destiny or Body Palace, one palace per year.\n\n**Yin and Yang of the Ten Celestial Stems**\n*Jia*, *Bing*, *Wu*, *Geng*, and *Ren* are yang; *Yi*, *Ding*, *Ji*, *Xin*, and *Gui* are yin.\n\n**On Major and Minor Limits**\nWhen the limit traverses a perilous or fallen palace, and baleful stars converge, calamity arrives.\nFurther reckon the flow year and month—even if death does not come, talent is impaired.\n\n**Sequential Arrangement of Flow Years (Repeated)**\nFirst: Grand Year Star\nSecond: Grand Yang\nThird: Gate of Mourning\nFourth: Grand Yin\nFifth: Official Talisman\nSixth: Death Talisman\nSeventh: Year Breaker\nEighth: Dragon Virtue\nNinth: White Tiger\nTenth: Fortune Star\nEleventh: Hanging Guest\nTwelfth: Sickness Talisman\n\n**Formula for Determining Life and Death**\nThe stars govern regions where fortune and misfortune may be discerned; predicting life and death is most difficult.\nFor adults, first observe Celestial Lament, then note where Celestial Void resides and which palaces the Body and Destiny occupy.\nIf Celestial Lament directly occupies the Body or Destiny Palace, and Celestial Void shares the same position, with benevolent stars lacking strength, the native will die within three to five years—some within two days.\nIf the two stars appear in the Destiny but not the Body, or the Body but not the Destiny, death comes within a few years.\nIf the Body or Destiny receives aid from benevolent stars, death occurs only when the limit is exhausted.\nFurther observe if Punishment or Blade oppose or align—if so, death is violent and without good end.\nThe same applies to limit traversal; the judgment is unerring.\n*Example*: If the Destiny is in Leo, and the limit reaches the palace where Celestial Lament resides in Aquarius, opposing the limit year *Wei*, death may be predicted. It must wait until the subsequent cycle reaches the *Zi* Palace to confirm.\nIf Celestial Lament is in Sagittarius’ *Yin* Palace, and the limit also reaches Sagittarius’ *Yin* Palace, death may be predicted—or perhaps a rebirth.\nIf the flow year converges with the Destiny Palace, and auspicious stars lend support, it is favorable.\nFor matters of fulfillment, judge only by the Lament Star; when the limit reaches Celestial Void, death may be predicted. The rest follows accordingly.\nCelestial Void governs mourning; if benevolent stars intervene, the misfortune may be averted.\nCelestial Lament, even with auspicious stars, cannot escape the fate of death when the limit is exhausted.\nIf it dwells with baleful stars, death comes as soon as the limit is entered.\nOnly Celestial Longevity, when present, can extend life.\nYet even with the aid of hidden virtue, its power to prolong life does not exceed the nine yang numbers.\n\nOne account of baleful limits states: if the Celestial Blade star is absent, and the limit reaches a palace where it is enshrined or at peak power, a family member will surely shed tears. The same holds when Celestial Void arrives at its limit. Celestial Staff, regardless of whether it resides in a temple or radiant palace, also brings mourning garb. Should the Celestial Wanderer or Weeping Star ascend to the throne, death may likewise be predicted.\n\nAn ancient verse says:\nA guest arrives, and zither and books are set aside;\nEven a child might sketch this scene.\nWhen power and influence are forgotten, righteousness weighs heavy;\nGolden bonds of friendship are forged in shared purpose.\nAmid osmanthus fragrance, the scholar toils;\nBefore the jeweled-tree hall, the traveler’s carriage halts.\nNow Guan and Liu are met again,\nTheir names fragrant for a thousand years, spread through the countryside.\n\nYet when carbuncles and ulcers fester and burst, the great fate follows—meeting with overturned wheels, yet still lost in confusion.\n\nThe Nine Yang Stars determine the weight of fortune and misfortune:\nPurple Wood, Literary Wood, Fortune Earth, Emolument Wood, Seal Earth, Longevity Earth, Staff Wood, Treasury Earth, and Yao Wood.\nWhen in yang palaces, fortune is heavy and calamity light;\nWhen in yin palaces, fortune is light and calamity heavy.\n\nThe Nine Yin Stars likewise divide the weight of misfortune and fortune:\nNoble Earth, Crimson Metal, Strange Earth, Hair Water, Void Water, Thread Earth, Punishment Fire, Blade Metal, and Weeping Metal.\nWhen in yin palaces, fortune is heavy and calamity light;\nWhen in yang palaces, calamity is heavy and fortune light.\nHow could one not examine this with care?\nYet if they reside in temples or flourish in prosperous palaces, one need not be bound by yin and yang.\n\nThe Three Terraces Entering the Seat\nThese two stars are the *qi* of the Purple Spirit, wielding the authority of the Northern Dipper. They govern the pure and noble constellations of celestial mechanisms, presiding over literary success, official advancement, and auspicious blessings. When one’s fate aligns with solitary numbers, they become the deities of Left Auxiliary and Right Assistant, known as the Three Harmonies and Eight Seats.\n\nIf they illuminate the Wife Palace, it portends separation or harm; the same applies to the Heavenly Palace. When these two stars shine upon a person’s life or fate, or upon the limit, it is most auspicious—a sign of great nobility and unimpeded success.\n\nFor the Three Terraces star:\nFor men and women, begin at the *xu* (11th) position, count forward from the first month to the month of birth, then count from one to the day of birth.\n\nFor the Eight Seats star:\nFor men and women, begin at the *chen* (5th) position, count forward from the first month to the month of birth, then count from one to the day of birth.\n\nDragon Pond and Phoenix Pavilion\nThese two stars are the celestial overseers of literary brilliance, remnants of the Metal Star, governing literary honors and scholarly success. When present in a person’s fate, they bestow refinement, cleverness, elegance, and gentle goodness. For men and women alike, they bring the chance to ride dragons and attach to phoenixes, achieving illustrious rank, abundant wealth, and ample emolument. For women, they confer exceptional beauty, versatile talents, and a heart unmoved by wanton desires. If in a weak palace, their influence is slight; if in a strong palace, their fortune is profound.\n\nFor Dragon Pond:\nFor men and women, begin at the *chen* (5th) position, count forward from the *zi* (1st) hour to the hour of birth.\n\nFor Phoenix Pavilion:\nFor men and women, begin at the *xu* (11th) position, count backward from the *zi* (1st) hour to the hour of birth.\n\nThese eighteen stars have their own configurations, and beyond them lie greater patterns, now selected as follows:\n\nIf a person’s Life and Destiny Palaces reside in *hai* (12th) or *zi* (1st), and the stars do not enter their temples, it is called the \"Body Drowned in Rivers and Lakes\" pattern.\nFor men and women in *xu* (11th), *hai* (12th), *chen* (5th), or *si* (6th), it is called the \"Child’s Head Enmeshed in a Net\" pattern.\nIf the Life Palace is in *si* (6th), it is called the \"Body Entering the Poor Folk\" pattern, portending the loss of a spouse.\nIf the Destiny rests upon the Blade, it is called the \"Grinding Candle as Destiny\" pattern, marked by frequent success and failure.\nWhen Celestial Blade and Celestial Void reside in *mao* (4th), it is called the \"Destiny Seated at the Gate of Wealth\" pattern.\nAs for baleful influences that do not prove baleful, there are always auspicious matters to mitigate them.\n\nIf a person is born in the *mao* (4th) hour with their Destiny seated in the *mao* (4th) palace, it is called \"Serpent Entering the Dragon’s Palace\"—regardless of the time, all born with their Destiny in *mao* (4th) are auspicious.\n\nThe Seven Strong Palaces\nWhen auspicious stars descend and reside, the Fortune Palace becomes a palace of blessing. The fields and dwellings, wife and concubines, and official emolument palaces are of the highest strength; for men and women, the Virtue Palace is next in strength, followed by the Talent and Wealth Palace as nearly strong.\n\nThe Five Strong Palaces\nAppearance and servants are of ill weakness; if further debilitated, the Brothers Palace is half-debased, also called the \"Idle Palace.\" Illness and misfortune, migration and movement are of secondary weakness; baleful stars residing in temples are considered extraordinary.\n\nThe Nine Auspicious Stars Entering Temples (Example)\nPurple, Literary, Crimson, Noble, Fortune, Green, Seal, Longevity, and Treasury—if just three to five of these shine upon a strong palace, they bestow honor and nobility.\nLiterary Brilliance and Celestial Nobility govern scholarly fame and literary distinction, mastery of classics and canons.\nCelestial Punishment delighting in the Heavenly Treasury, residing in the Life Palace and illuminating the body, along with four strong palaces, must indicate a person of true talent and solid virtue, one who rises above the crowd.\n\nThe Nine Baleful Stars Entering Temples (Example)\nPunishment, Strange, Blade, Staff, Void, Weeping, Hair, and Yao.\nWhen baleful stars reside in temples and flourish, illuminating the body and fate, they bring fortune. If they do not reside in temples or flourish, they bring misfortune.\nCelestial Punishment residing in a temple transforms into a star of literary elegance, governing talent and learning.\nCelestial Blade entering a temple governs the accumulation of grain and may also govern avarice, vanity, and the depletion of talent and wealth. One’s fate and limit should not encounter Punishment and Blade.\nWhen Void and Weeping illuminate the Life and Destiny Palaces, they harm the wives and concubines of men and women. If they enter temples and flourish, scholars may die before their time.\nHair Head and Void Depletion are taboo when illuminating the Talent and Wealth or Wife and Concubines Palaces, as they bring harm to wives and great loss of talent and wealth. When baleful stars bring misfortune, one must weigh whether the baleful outweighs the auspicious.\n\nLimit Verse for Refined Judgment\nHeaven hangs its images, earth forms its shapes;\nWho can fathom the rise and fall of human affairs?\nFirst examine the limits for passage or blockage,\nThen observe the stars for withering or flourishing.\nThe Life Palace and Official Emolument are strongest;\nFor men and women, migration and harmony align with the Three Harmonies.\nParents should be exalted, flanked by wives and concubines;\nNearly strong are wealth and talent, illness and fortune.\n\nHexagram Statement\nThe Three Palaces of Brothers are called \"Idle Extremes\";\nIll weakness must still be borne by servants.\n\nShould one’s appearance be ill-favored or weak, take careful note—\nthe rest need not be pondered with painful deliberation.\n\n**Verse on Judging the Limit Cycles**\nThe limit cycles and years bear their own ebb and flow;\nwhen the limit flows freely, the self is naturally auspicious.\nEven if the year’s stars turn baleful,\nwhat care for minor calamities and misfortunes?\n\n**Hexagram Statement**\nConjoined with Blade and Punishment stars, one must suffer the machinations of punishment.\nWhen Void Wailing and Residual Dew stars arise, songs of lament follow.\nWhen the great limit nears its end,\nVoid Wailing in the natal palace reveals the Blade’s presence.\nThough auspicious stars may shine upon the year,\ntrust only in ten deaths for every single life.\n\n**Life Palace**\nFavorable are the stars of fortune and emolument;\nif they align with one’s later years, old age brings ease, bounty, and freedom from illness.\nWith the aid of auspicious stars, they govern three destinies:\nfirst, wealth;

Alas, what can be done?\n\n**Fourth: The Palace of Fields and Dwellings**\nFavor **Pass** and **Treasury** when stars are in exaltation or vigor;\n**Heavenly Anomaly** is inauspicious—parents die young.\nIf **Treasury** and **Heavenly Intent** shine together,\nFirst ruin, then success—this is a fate of self-reliance.\n\n**Purple, Nobility, Seal, Ancestral Fruit**—abundant.\n**Fortune, Treasury, Talent**—if above flourish, much evil harms the father.\n\n**Pass** with **Talent**—avoid clashes and ruptures.\n\n**Longevity**—level.\n\n**Red**—fields and dwellings flourish; **Literary Prosperity, Emolument**—abundant grain.\n\n**Void, Staff, Blade**—first enjoy blessings.\n\n**Anomaly**—breaks ancestral ties.\n\n**Mao**—often breaks, often succeeds.\n\n**Yao**—breaks ancestral ties.\n\n**Punishment**—self-destruction, self-achievement.\n\n**Weeping** combined with **Treasury** or **Pass**—first ruin, then success; if in exaltation or vigor, property surpasses ancestral fields.\n\n**Void**—self-achievement, self-reliance.\n\nFields and dwellings meeting **Mao, Void, Anomaly**—\nAncestral property and talent vanish like dust.\nIf **Treasury** or **Pass** shine upon the self,\nFirst ruin, then success—one establishes anew.\n\n**Fortune, Emolument, Seal, Longevity**—many fields and dwellings.\n**Yao, Mao, Punishment, Anomaly**—parents’ burdens weigh heavy.\nFirst ruin, then success—**Seal** breaking is auspicious.\n**Heavenly Void**—fields and dwellings come to naught.\n\n**Fifth: The Palace of Sons and Daughters**\nThe poem says: In the five positions, life abounds,\nChildren and grandchildren fill the eye.\nYet male and female stars should not shine here,\nFor they bring misfortune—**Weeping, Void** too cause early death, many do not survive.\n\n**Three Days’ Office**—in high and strong positions, good for generating **Fortune** and **Emolument**.\n\nThe body traverses degrees—twins;\nThe moon in inauspicious traversal—two share the breast.\n\n**Purple**—one or two children, first daughter, then son;\nIn exaltation or vigor, children and grandchildren are noble and flourishing;\nIn prosperous places, four or five children form a line.\n\n**Nobility**—two or three children, glory for posterity.\n\n**Void**—in old age, no children, or none survive;\nOtherwise, drifting in foreign lands.\nOnly adopted children bring joy.\nIf not, children suffer illness.\n\n**Treasury, Longevity, Seal, Pass**—children bring honor to the family.\n\n**Red**—many daughters, few sons survive.\n\n**Fortune, Literary Prosperity**—three to five children, wealth and nobility;\nAvoid clashes and ruptures.\n\n**Emolument**—brings glory, children who change the family’s reputation.\n\n**Staff**—children do not survive, or barely do.\n\n**Weeping**—harm and loss; one or two may see one through to the end.\n\n**Anomaly**—estranged nurturing; children are hard to come by;\nOne may be raised by a relative, or else an adopted child.\n\n**Mao**—male and female children cause ancestral violence and violent death;\nIf favorably placed, children bring blessings.\n\n**Blade**—children suffer illness, break the family estate;\nAvoid harm and loss—adopted children are the exception.\n\n**Yao**—male and female children are of little help, drifting;\nSons are unruly, daughters impure.\n\n**Punishment**—children are as if absent, unfilial.\nIf auspicious stars share the palace,\nOne in three children may see one through to the end.\nIf the three harmonies meet with evil stars, none are born;\nMale and female children are adopted.\nWomen suffer birth calamities.\n\n**Pass**—two or three children survive.\n\nThe poem says:\n\n**Mao**—must not reside over sons and daughters;\nChildren and daughters-in-law are born like raging tigers.\nIf encountering Celestial Nobility or Red Phoenix,\nDescendants will naturally rise in glory.\n\n**Mao** with Punishment and Blade is fiercely violent;\nIf Void and Weeping converge, it bodes ill fate.\nShould both palaces be graced by auspicious stars,\nServants and descendants will know joy and ease.\n\n**Four Malefics** with Punishment and Flesh—within the womb, deformity is certain.\n**Anomaly**—anomalous star governs anomalous births;\nIf it falls upon progeny, discord follows.\nMiscarriages and stepchildren are but trifling matters—\nEven a wife’s elder brother may bring them forth.\n\n**Three Punishments** clash with life—before birth, the mother’s body is surely harmed.\n**Literary Brilliance** yields many children, though Purple and Red are sparse;\nThe eldest son is hard to come by, and the staff is but an empty token.\n**Seal** and **Longevity** stars beget two sons;\n**Fortune** star’s sons and daughters are also worthy of esteem.\n\n**Sixth Palace of Servants**\nMust not see **Literary Brilliance**—such a one is less wise than their servants.\n**Celestial Blade** and **Celestial Staff** govern strong servants.\nIf **Weeping** and **Void** appear, banditry is no concern.\n**Purple** is difficult to manage.\n**Staff**, **Blade**, **Longevity**, **Fortune**, **Weeping**, **Pass**, **Red**, and **Emolument**—servants stand in awe.\n**Literary** and **Void**—intelligence cannot distinguish servants.\n**Nobility** and **Seal** must not secretly advance or flee.\n**Mao** and **Punishment**—servants are fierce and malicious by nature.\n**Yao** and **Anomaly**—maidservants prove capable.\nIf the **Servant Palace** is weak, they follow their mother upon marriage;\nAt the time of betrothal, they must be exchanged or held by the father.\n**Purple** and **Literary** are ill-suited for servants;\n**Void** star’s wisdom is inferior to that of servants.\nIf encountering **Staff** and **Blade**, they prove capable;\n**Celestial Punishment** and **Mao**—servants are absent.\n**Yao** and **Anomaly**—maidservants are dependable;\n**Storehouse** and **Emolument** attract many able servants.\n\n**Seventh Palace of Wives and Concubines**\nShould **Red Phoenix** and **Celestial Nobility** shine upon it,\nOne gains a beautiful and noble wife, along with servants and maids.\nMust not see **Celestial Anomaly**—it foretells separation,\nOr caution against loss, leading to remarriage.\n**Purple** in the court brings a wife of noble appearance.\nIf debilitated, she is wanton and dissolute.\nA woman who marries peacefully is often one who cultivates the Dao,\nPractices virtue, and reaps good karma.\nBoth men and women possess decisiveness.\n**Void** governs loss and harm—delay marriage to avoid misfortune.\nIt may also mean no wife, or many encounters with monks and Daoists.\n**Nobility** brings a wife of beauty and purity.\n**Seal** gains wealth through his wife; with **Staff**, they do not age together.\n**Longevity** suits elderly couples.\n**Void** and **Wood** are auspicious.\n**Red** brings a wife of lovely countenance.\n**Storehouse** gains wives and concubines, though not in old age.\n**Emolument** brings a noble wife, but shuns inauspicious stars in opposition.\n**Literary** brings a wife of wit and cleverness;\nIf **Hanging** and the three directions are afflicted by malefics, caution is needed.\n**Pass** governs a wife of improper conduct for men,\nAnd a husband of poor character for women.\nIn the positions of **Si**, **Wu**, **Jia**, and **Hai**, there is no sorrow—\nIt also signifies a wife of talent.\n**Fortune** brings a virtuous and kind wife,\nBut if afflicted by **Anomaly** or **Punishment**, it is inauspicious.\n**Staff** brings solitary or sickly spouses.\n**Mao** harms and clashes with a strong-willed wife.\n**Anomaly** harms two or three, and discord prevails—\nOtherwise, it portends separation.\nIt may also indicate remarriage, which is ill for both men and women.\n**Blade**—men are harmed by wine and lust, women face peril in childbirth.\nIt also brings hardship, neglect, and frequent harm.\n**Punishment** brings harm and loss—delaying may avert it.\n**Celestial Staff**—couples suffer many illnesses and worries, and must guard against favored concubines.\n**Yao** with remarriage also brings harmony.\nBut if **Staff**, **Anomaly**, and malefics converge, it foretells separation in life or death.\nIf in an exalted position or encountered in favorable years, it adds longevity,\nAnd harmonious affairs bring contentment.\n**Weeping** often brings punishment and calamity.\n\nThe poem says:\nIn the seventh palace, free of malefics,\nLute and zither harmonize in song.\nIf husband and wife part ways, their paths diverge—\nYet if Red Phoenix and Nobility favor them,\nA virtuous wife and noble sons bring stability;\nWeeping stars here bring only sorrow.\nNobility, Seal, and Longevity make for good spouses;\nVoid, Blade, Mao, and Punishment bring harm.\nIf the three directions meet with malefics,\nRemarriage two or three times is likely.\nPunishment, Void, Mao, and Blade bring multiple wives—\nOnly Red Phoenix grants a wife of rare beauty.\nNobility, Yao, Storehouse, and Emolument bring wives of talent;\nCelestial Anomaly foretells separation or estrangement.\n\n**Eighth Palace of Illness and Calamity**\nMust not see **Yao** or **Anomaly** stars—\nThey bring hunchbacks, stooped backs, and severe foot ailments.\n○ **Purple**, **Void**, **Nobility**, **Longevity**, **Yao**, **Mao**, **Void**\n**Anomaly**—chronic illness, afflictions of the eyes, hands, and feet,\nLung congestion, wheezing, and constant coughing.\n○ **Seal**, **Red**, **Storehouse**, **Pass**, **Literary**, **Blade**—**Fortune** and **Emolument**\n○ **Yao** and **Weeping**—internal organs are unsettled,\nBringing hunchbacks and lame feet.\nIf the **Palace of Illness and Calamity** at birth aligns with **Human** and **Horse**,\nOr shares the same region as the **Ghost Gate**,\nAnd is debilitated or afflicted by **Blade**, **Anomaly**, or **Punishment**,\nThe harm extends to the **Wings**, leading to muteness.\n**Blade** and **Punishment** in the **Palace of Illness and Calamity** are feared—\nThe five organs rebel, and treatment is ineffective.\nLame feet, hunchbacks, and stooped backs,\nYear after year, weeping and illness are inevitable.\nWhere does the **Body Star** fall into debility?\nIf it meets malefics, it is most inauspicious.\nIf the **Eight Malefics** converge and shine upon it,\nOne knows the essence and vitality will surely be harmed.\nThe **Palace of Illness and Calamity** must not see **Celestial Yao**—\n**Anomaly** star brings strange and perplexing troubles.\n**Punishment** and **Blade** bring frequent illness;\n**Celestial Nobility** and **Literary Brilliance** may mitigate them.\n**Yao**, **Anomaly**, **Mao**, and **Punishment** bring chronic ailments;\nRelying on minor **Fortune** and **Longevity** averts disaster.\nAuspicious and inauspicious stars intermingle—examine closely;\nIf malefics approach, misfortune follows.\n\n**Ninth Palace of Migration**\nMust not see **Mao**, **Punishment**, or **Blade** shining upon it—\nTraveling abroad brings risks of bandits and violent perils,\nIn severe cases, even death; observe whether benevolent stars offer salvation.\n**Purple**—traveling and residing abroad brings proximity to nobility.\n**Void**—leaving one’s homeland enhances talent.\n**Seal**—abroad, one gains talent and emolument.\n**Nobility**—traveling and residing abroad brings the aid of noble persons.\n**Longevity**—traveling abroad is auspicious.\n**Storehouse** and **Pass**—abroad, one gains talent and good fortune.\n**Red**—abroad, one enjoys talent and joyous occasions;\nMeeting the **Three Harmonies** brings auspicious talent—\nThis pertains to the nine schools of Confucianism and the various arts.\n**Literary**—traveling and residing abroad brings proximity to nobility and good fortune.\n**Fortune**—migration brings success;\nMeeting the **Three Harmonies** with auspicious stars, one travels as they please.\n**Emolument**—often encounters high nobility.\n**Staff**—traveling and residing abroad are inauspicious.\n**Mao**—on the road, one encounters bandits, harm, and violent misfortune,\nAnd may also face water-related calamities.\n**Anomaly**—one finds no peace or tranquility.\n**Yao**—traveling and residing abroad bring harmony with others.\n**Blade**—distant journeys attract bandits.\n**Punishment**—distant journeys are inauspicious;\nIf **Celestial Weeping** is encountered, bandits and violent misfortunes follow.\n\nWeeping—distant journeys and travel bring much quarreling, slander, and strife.\nVoid—all affairs come to naught.\n\n**Song:**\nWhen moving or traveling, if Punishment and Blade meet Mao,\nOne must encounter thieves and robbers on the road.\nIf no auspicious stars come to the rescue of an unnatural death,\nOnly without malevolent stars need one have no worry.\n\nWhen Celestial Nobility wanders and travels, one frequently meets the noble;\nSeal, Vegetation, Fortune, and Emolument may draw near.\nThough Mao, Punishment, and Blade guard in vain against thieves,\nOne may yet become a wandering ghost in a foreign land.\n\n**Palace of the Ten Officials and Emolument**\nIt is auspicious to see Seal, Ribbon, and Literary Brilliance—\nOne attains scholarly rank at the imperial examination.\nIf in a temple or at its peak, one holds high office and is promoted.\nIf Void Star appears, one’s life lacks emolument.\n\nWhen Purple Name returns to the Golden Bowl and enters the temple,\nOne’s fame reaches the imperial ear, and life flows without cease,\nUnentangled in strife.\nIf meeting Phoenix in youth, one passes the examination;\nIf broken by opposition, one does not attain nobility.\n\nVoid brings an empty reputation—\nA strange person whose power is naturally indecisive.\nNobility—when meeting affairs, one fears nothing;\nWithout malevolence, one’s life is peaceful and secure.\n\nSeal—one can govern the household,\nFurther gains land, and with mutual resonance of Celestial Nobility,\nOne is destined to be a general, enfeoffed as a marquis—\nA life of great nobility.\nIf in youth one passes the examination, one early wields banners;\nIf a commoner does not gain land, one still lives in tranquility.\n\nLongevity entering the temple—\nIn youth, one passes the imperial examination,\nCompassionate toward the multitude, seeing affairs from afar.\nEmolument is as above.\n\nRed possesses benevolence and righteousness—\nOne gains felicity, delights in propriety, and avoids recklessness.\nTreasury—good at planning, talent, and calculation;\nEntering the temple, one’s name spreads among Chinese and barbarians.\n\nLinked—throughout life, one is kind and decisive;\nIf broken, it is inauspicious.\nMao—undaunted by affairs, one is not afraid of being slighted.\n\nWeeping removes literary grace.\nLiterary entering the temple—\nIn youth, one attains scholarly rank, holds a banner and staff,\nA gentleman of pure office, or a monk or Daoist of purity;\nA commoner draws near to the noble.\n\nYao—easily provoked to evil, one must guard one’s words;\nMany affairs, many words.\n\n**Poem:**\nWhen in the Palace of Celestial Emolument, Punishment and Staff shine,\nExile and penal servitude are not worth mentioning.\nIf Celestial Weeping further strikes in opposition,\nOne dies in penal servitude, wounded or perished—misfortune visits itself.\n\nOf official emolument, Punishment and Blade cannot be spoken;\nImprisonment and litigation entangle, calamities connect.\nIf Celestial Seal and Literary Brilliance reside in this place,\nIn youth, one gains high promotion in an unexpected land.\n\nOfficial emolument must meet Seal and Noble Star;\nStaff, Micro, Red, and Longevity are all mediocre.\nCelestial Void, Punishment, and Blade bring no substantial achievement;\nOnly if meeting Literary Brilliance does one’s great name spread.\n\n**Palace of the Eleven Fortunes and Virtues**\nIt is auspicious to see Fortune, Longevity, and Seal—auspicious stars;\nFurther auspicious if in a temple or at its peak.\nIf common Void Star shines and breaks it, one’s life lacks fortune,\nOr falls into ruin.\n\nIf Punishment and Blade approach,\nOne must suffer deafness, blindness, goiter, or tumors.\nPurple, Longevity, and Red—throughout life, clothing and food are secure and peaceful.\nNobility and Literary—clothing and emolument are pure and abundant.\n\nSeal spreads one’s name.\nTreasury—wealth and emolument.\nLinked—unconventional talent.\nFortune—firm and steadfast.\nEmolument—official emolument.\n\nStaff and Anomaly—laborious, toiling, advancing and retreating.\nMao, Yao, Blade, and Weeping—one’s fortune is meager and inauspicious.\nVoid—throughout life, one lacks wealth,\nOne’s person is in a ruined place;\nIf further met by Punishment and Blade,\nOne must suffer illnesses of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, arms, or feet.\n\nPunishment—labor of the heart, resentment, calamity, and penal servitude.\nIf Void and Weeping further strike, one is wounded or perishes;\nIf meeting auspicious stars, half is saved.\nYao—one’s body is disordered, one’s heart is busy.\n\n**Song:**\n\nFortune and virtue unseen—where Heaven’s Void prevails,\nThe blessed alone remain untouched by bale.\nIf Punishment and Anomaly cast their baleful light,\nEven without illness, one lives in dread and plight.\n\nWhen the Body Palace stands pure and auspicious, fret not over fate;\nFortune and virtue, steadfast and lofty, transcend all debate.\nThe Palace of Fortune and Virtue must host propitious stars,\nFor youth to enjoy ease and honor, free from scars.\n\nShould malevolent luminaries meet the Seal without grace,\nEarly loss befalls wife, servants, and brothers in their place.\n\nTwelfth: The Palace of Appearance\nFitting to encounter Void and Weeping—through life, few woes.\nIll-suited for Body and Destiny—if Mao and Heavenly Weeping align,\nDisfigurement follows; meeting Nobility brings great fortune benign.\nPurple—lone qi.\nNobility—crimson, literary, fair of face.\nSeal—authority and might.\nLongevity—ancient visage.\nTreasury—talent revealed.\nLinked—sudden rise.\nVoid—illness and calamity shun its clash.\nFortune and emolument in exalted palaces—from nothing, glory and wealth amass.\n\nStaff—later affliction and distress.\nYao—fair and refined.\nMao—ugly visage.\nWeeping—appearance marred by illness.\nAnomaly, Blade, Punishment—disfigurement, affliction, and distress.\n\n**Song:**\nThe Palace of Appearance must not meet Weeping’s sorrow,\nLest wounds mar the face, a limp shoulder follow.\nIf this palace encounters such baleful rays,\nIllness and misfortune surely blight one’s days.\n\n**Song:**\nThe Palace of Appearance must not meet Anomaly’s star,\nNor Punishment and Blade draw near from afar.\nIf Body and Destiny these luminaries behold,\nHidden illness and strange calamities unfold.\n\n**Song:**\nThe Palace of Appearance with Literary Brilliance is not ideal,\nBut Fortune and Longevity bestow long years, serene and real.\nIf inauspicious stars assail, ancestral ties may break,\nRed Phoenix and Heavenly Weeping—examine for truth’s sake.\n\nIn the Zi, Shen, Si, and You palaces, Purple Qi stands high and strong,\nFor priests and shamans, a share in lofty destinies belong.\n○ Star name: Purple Tenuity, dwelling in Zi’s domain.\nFor men—halls of learning, academies; for women—embroidery and silk’s artful gain.\nWithout Mao’s touch, men don crowns and reap emolument’s store;\nWithout Blade’s reach, women grace noble chambers evermore.\nIf in Si’s palace, or You and Hai’s course it flows,\nFortune and emolument overflow, and fame bestows.\n\nThe Purple Qi’s star, when lone, makes monks, nuns, or wanderers of the way,\nOr those who follow after, in its solitary sway.\n\n**Song:**\nThis star in decline—through life, a scholar old,\nYet if in Zi’s palace Purple Tenuity takes hold,\nWealth, nobility, and renown spread far and wide,\nPunishment and Anomaly absent—harmony abides.\n\n**Song:**\nPurple Qi returns to its proper sphere,\nMaster of letters, peerless and clear.\nIn Hai, You, Zi, and Si’s embrace,\nRiches, longevity, talent, and virtue grace.\nClad in purple, girded with gold—none compare,\nWhat fear of rank unadorned or honor rare?\n\n**Song:**\nPurple Qi meets Purple Qi—celestial splendor bright,\nAuspicious stars conjoin to double its light.\nLone Constellation and Heavenly Opposition idle in their station,\nDestined for Daoist or Buddhist vocation.\nBody and Destiny meet it—longevity assured,\nPurple Qi in glory—bliss is secured.\nNobility and prominence in the imperial court reside,\nWith Heavenly Blade as aide, a minister’s rank applied.\n\n**Song:**\nPurple Qi—artists of

yin men and yang women proceed in reverse.\nStart from the palace of one’s birth and life.\n\nUse the Purple Forbidden, Luan, Literary, Noble, Void, Seal, Longevity, Fortune, Emolument, Storehouse, and Link stars to arrange the remaining external stars, along with the Greater and Lesser Weeping Stars.\nReverse the annual Tai Sui to the previous palace, proceeding counterclockwise before the Purple Forbidden and Void.\nObserve the Staff, Divergent, Tiger, Fur, Serpent, Blade, and Boar stars—all proceed counterclockwise from Wu.\nWhen encountering Punishment at You, Maiden at Chou, or the same in reverse, proceed in harmony with the Tai Sui’s conjunction.\nThe Lesser Weeping Star’s position is one palace before Shen as the auxiliary; one palace behind the body holds three days.\nFor life and fate, there are two palaces of decline and three of destiny.\nThe two declines are at Wei; when encountering the first Rooster, second Serpent, third Horse, fourth Goat, fifth Tiger, sixth Rabbit, seventh Dragon, eighth Pig, ninth Dog, tenth Goat, eleventh Monkey, or twelfth Rat, fortune and misfortune must be carefully examined.\n\nIf one’s three-day period includes an auspicious star, it signifies encounters with noble patrons, advancement, and wealth—most favorable in the Migration Palace.\n\n*End of the First Scroll of the Purple Forbidden Astrology*\n\n**Tai Yi Golden Well: On the Profound Principles of Yin and Yang**\n*Beginning of the Second Scroll of the Purple Forbidden Astrology*\n\nA person is endowed with the qi of Heaven and Earth, receiving the essence of yin and yang to give rise to their body and fate. Above, they belong to the Five Stars; below, to the Five Phases. If the timing is correct, their body and fate will be exalted, and their future bright and prosperous. If the timing is incorrect, their fate will be base and their body lowly, sinking into obscurity and drift.\n\nGenerally, one’s life must find the stars in their proper positions, with favorable fortune and strength aligning to bring success. Moreover, if one delights in prosperity without affliction, and auspicious stars reside in strong palaces, they are a person of profound fortune. This is predestined, governed by the stars.\n\nIn examining fate, first determine the Body Palace, for the body is linked above to the spirit of Tai Yi. If beneficent stars meet with prosperous fortune in their proper positions, forming celestial harmony, this is a life of purity and nobility. Only then should one assess the Fate Palace and the hour, for if these are shallow or unstable, they lack strength. Even with powerful stars, their blessings will be slight. Only when timing is correct and positions proper can one attain glory, virtue, fields and dwellings, official rank, and emolument.\n\nThe six palaces’ good and ill determine survival and demise; nobility and baseness fix fortune and misfortune, yielding accurate predictions. Whenever stars reside in palaces of honor or places of joy and prosperity, one must also consider the yin and yang divisions of the palaces. As the classic states: “Yang stars favor goodness; yin stars favor destruction.”\n\nIn the two palaces of stars and fate, when the division of hours and quarters yields more yang than yin—such as being born in the first, second, third, or fourth quarter of the hour—one’s fortune will be abundant, life long, parents blessed, siblings harmonious, wife virtuous, and children outstanding. If one’s body and fate further reside in palaces of honor and prosperity, this is a life of the highest rank.\n\nMen born under yang stars are noble births. Those born in the first four quarters will be resolute and blessed. Women born under yin stars are honorable births. Those born from the fifth to the eighth quarter will excel in wifely virtue, enjoy support from maternal kin, harmony with sisters-in-law, a marriage of mutual respect, and children who are both talented and numerous.\n\nOne must calculate the hour precisely to gauge fortune and misfortune, determine the harmony of flesh and bone, discern the presence of affliction or conflict, and distinguish between wealth and poverty, wisdom and folly.\n\nYang stars govern civil matters and thrive in their palaces of honor and prosperity. Occupying the six yang palaces, they produce scholars of refined literary grace. Yin stars govern martial matters and flourish in places of joy and prosperity. Occupying the six yin domains, they produce warriors of courage and resolve.\n\nWhenever stars reside in yang within yang or in yin within yin, each following its kind, this is called “finding its proper position.” The opposite—yin and yang intermingled—is called “not finding its proper position.” The qi one receives may be turbid: within a single day, from *mao* to *shen* (5 a.m. to 5 p.m.) are the six yang hours of daylight; from *you* to *yin* (5 p.m. to 5 a.m.) are the six yin hours of night.\n\nThose born in yin palaces should avoid daytime births; those born in yang palaces should avoid nighttime births. Both positions are unfavorable at the same hour. Further, births occurring at the cusp of day and night, or when the hour straddles upper and lower quarters, require careful assessment of fortune and lifespan. If yin and yang are mixed, the quarters uneven, and the pairing inauspicious, this—beyond mere honor or prosperity—portends a life of meager fortune and short span.\n\nMoreover, one must observe the transiting limits where beneficent or malefic stars enter the moments of body and fate, for this precisely determines fortune and misfortune, all of which will be verified.\n\n**The Three Divisions of Flesh and Bone: A Rhymed Exposition**\nOf old, the profound principle was called the Purple Forbidden, uniquely holding the wonders of a single school. It became the marvel of the Three Divisions, exploring the roots of stars’ good and ill, thoroughly seeking the inner mysteries, and fixing the noble and base positions of the palaces. By careful examination, survival and demise are discerned.\n\nWhen the Supreme Ultimate first divided, the Three Powers were complete. Yet why do some grow poor and die young? Why do others grow rich and live long? The reasons lie in fate’s rise and fall, in the purity or impurity of one’s nature, and in the alternation of calamity and fortune.\n\nTracing back to ancient texts, blessings and emoluments shine together in the Purple Forbidden’s position. All stars’ conditions, hours, and quarters are detailed below.\n\n*Mao* transmission belongs to yang:\nPurple Wood, Literary Wood, Fortune Earth, Emolument Wood, Seal Earth, Longevity Earth, Staff Wood, Storehouse Earth, Yao Water, Noble Earth, Crimson Metal, Strangeness Earth, Hair Water, Emptiness Water, Noble Earth, Punishment Fire, Blade Metal, Wailing Metal.\n\n*Chen* hour, yang:\nLiterary, Fortune, Auspiciousness, Seal, Longevity, Staff, Storehouse.\n\n**Yao** transmission, *Zi* (Purple), *Hong* (Crimson), *Yi* (Strangeness), *Mao* (Hair), *Xu* (Emptiness), *Guan* (Piercing),\n**Punishment**, **Blade**, **Wailing**, **Noble**.\n*Si* hour, yang:\nLiterary, Fortune, Emolument, Seal, Longevity, Staff, Storehouse,\n**Yao**, **Zi**, **Yi**, **Mao**, **Xu**, **Guan**, **Punishment**,\n**Blade**, **Wailing**, **Noble**, **Hong**.\n\n*Wu* hour, yang:\nEmolument, Seal, Longevity, Staff, Storehouse, **Yao**, **Zi**,\nLiterary, Fortune, **Mao**, **Xu**, **Guan**, **Punishment**, **Blade**,\n**Wailing**, **Noble**, **Hong**, **Yi**.\n\n*Wei* hour, yang:\nSeal, Longevity, Staff, Storehouse, **Hong**, **Zi**, Literary,\nFortune, **Lü** (Green), **Xu**, **Guan**, **Punishment**, **Blade**, **Wailing**,\n**Noble**, **Hong**, **Yi**, **Mao**.\n\n*Shen* hour, yang:\nLongevity, Staff, Storehouse, **Yao**, **Zi**, Literary, Fortune,\nEmolument, Seal, **Guan**, **Punishment**, **Blade**, **Wailing**, **Noble**,\n**Hong**, **Yi**, **Mao**, **Xu**.\n\n*You* hour, yin:\nStaff, Storehouse, **Yao**, **Zi**, Literary, **De** (Virtue), Emolument,\nSeal, Longevity, **Punishment**, **Blade**, **Wailing**, **Noble**, **Hong**,\n**Yi**, **Mao**, **Xu**, **Guan**.\n\n*Xu* hour, yin:\nStorehouse, **Yao**, **Zi**, Literary, Fortune, Emolument, Seal,\nLongevity, Staff, **Blade**, **Wailing**, **Noble**, **Hong**, **Yi**,\n**Mao**, **Xu**, **Guan**, **Punishment**.\n\n*Hai* hour, yin:\n**Yao**, **Zi**, Literary, Fortune, Emolument, Seal, Longevity,\nStaff, Storehouse, **Wailing**, **Noble**, **Hong**, **Yi**, **Mao**,\n**Xu**, **Guan**, **Punishment**, **Blade**.\n\n*Zi* hour, yin:\n**Zi**, Literary, **Xing** (Ape), Emolument, Seal, Longevity, Staff,\nStorehouse, **Yao**, **Noble**, **Xian** (Fiber), **Yi**, **Mao**, **Xu**,\n**Guan**, **Punishment**, **Blade**, **Wailing**.\n\n*Chou* hour, yin.\n\n**Yin** hour of *Yin*:\nLiterary, Fortune, Emolument, Seal, Longevity, Staff, Storehouse,\n**Yao**, **Zi**, **Hong**, **Yi**, **Mao**, **Xu**, **Guan**,\n**Punishment**, **Blade**, **Wailing**, **Noble**.\n\nFortune, Emolument, Seal, Longevity, Staff, Storehouse, **Yao**,\n**Zi**, Literary, **Yi**, **Mao**, **Xu**, **Guan**, **Punishment**,\n**Blade**, **Wailing**, **Noble**, **Hong**. ○ Poverty divides, thunderous **Noble** impoverishes the stable.\n**Wenchang** governs nobility.\n**Tianxu** governs poverty.\n**Tianyao** governs baseness.\n**Tianfu** governs wealth.\n**Tianren** governs punishment.\n**Tianlu** governs emolument.\n**Tiangui** governs emolument.\n**Tianku** governs punishment.\n**Maotou** governs depletion.\n**Tianzhang** punishes the father.\n**Tianshou** governs longevity.\n**Tianxing** governs punishment. ○\n\nIn the upper configuration, a noble fate—three days after the life and destiny palaces, the four auxiliary palaces are all auspicious.\nThe Old Man Star in conjunction portends parents of advanced age, attaining ministerial rank.\nIf the life and destiny palaces encounter the *Yifeng*, it is auspicious.\nThe **Difu** and Old Man in conjunction portend the mother’s longevity and elevation to ministerial or grandee status.\nWhen the **Luanwei**, Seal, Longevity, and other stars align with the day’s hour and moment, and further encounter beneficent stars in their celestial seats—three parts beneficence to one part exalted brilliance—this is the fate of the highest nobility.\nThe twelve hours divide into one hundred moments;

If the fortune star resides in its exalted palace, harmoniously aspecting the opposite palace, and the auxiliary star alone stands high over the life and destiny palaces, even a single star in its proper or exalted position shines brightly in a position of strength. Alternatively, if within the three-day palace and the eight *ke*, one occupies the domain of the six yin palaces, with the **Luan** star unaspected by the **Celestial Staff**, the mother enjoys long life, and if further exalted, this denotes a mid-chart noble destiny, a life of wealth and prominence.\n\n**Lower-Chart Noble Destiny:**\nWhen the **Taifu** star alone stands high over the life and destiny palaces, and the three-day palace is fully aspected by three auspicious stars in triple conjunction, this constitutes a lower-chart noble destiny. If the fortune star is exalted and strong while auspicious stars are weak and debilitated, it signifies a lesser noble destiny. Such is the interplay of yin and yang, the harmony of time and moment.\n\n**Common Destiny Outside the Chart:**\nWhen auspicious and inauspicious stars jointly aspect the life palace, and the **Taifu** star is not in its proper position, this denotes the destiny of a wealthy commoner. If the **Taifu** star is weak and debilitated, yet **Hongluan** aspects directly without affliction, and the **Red Luan** forms a harmonious aspect, this signifies a person of immense wealth.\n\n**Destitute and Lowly Destiny:**\nWhen the fortune star is debilitated in **Tianyao**, aspecting both the life and destiny palaces, with the **Xu** star in opposition, this marks the most destitute and lowly destiny—parents lost in early years, siblings few or nonexistent, wives and children harmed. Even if one encounters a favorable period with auspicious stars, wealth does not accumulate, for the root is shallow and weak. Though one may possess literary talent and official emolument, this does not constitute a destiny within the chart.\n\n**Foolish Destiny:**\nThe **Wenchang** star must not be debilitated, for the six auspicious stars, when in positions of strength, become inauspicious. If they do not reside in their proper palaces, how much more dire the misfortune? Generally, when stars enter the chart, one need not consider official emolument. For scholars, one must examine **Wenchang**; for commoners, one may simply observe **Tianlu** and **Tianzhang** to determine the measure of longevity and prosperity.\n\n**Determining the Aspects of Palace Conjunctions:**\nWhen fortune and longevity jointly aspect **Hongluan**, how can one not be intelligent? When **Xu** and **Yi** together attend **Maotou**, how can one not be dull-witted? If positioned in **Tianyin**, it governs migration and authority; if in **Wenchang**, it lacks the conduct of fortune and emolument. In the **Fields and Estates** palace, granaries overflow with grain; in the **Wealth and Silk** palace, coffers brim with gold and jade. When **Noble Emolument** aspects the **Children** palace, descendants bring glory; when **Storehouse** and **Guan** aspect the **Life and Destiny** palace, one’s future is ever secure, and honor flourishes. If **Yao** and **Yi** entangle the body, longevity is denied; if **Blade** and **Wailing** afflict destiny, **Tianxu** and **Tianren** bring only calamity. **Tianxing** and **Tianzhang**—who could find joy in their presence? When they meet wives and concubines, widowhood is often auspicious; when they enter the **Official Emolument** palace, poverty and illness abound. To encounter these stars in one’s fate is to face imminent peril; to pass beyond their influence is to escape disaster. Thus, destiny knows prosperity and adversity, but not permanence. The successful occupy positions of strength, while the struggling dwell in desolation. Honor, prosperity, and longevity arise from the conjunction of auspicious stars; violence, misfortune, and early death stem from the convergence of inauspicious ones. Without the stars, how could one examine the details? Without fate, how could one know the essentials? With keen focus and deep reflection, one may unlock the mysteries of this text. By discussing the present and exploring the past, one comes to recognize the excellence of this work.\n\n**Life and Death, Poverty and Wealth:**\nIf not predestined, how could one know? **Nobility and lowliness, prosperity and decay**—these are not matters of chance. The art of divination is both precise and subtle. By studying the classics, one may revisit them thrice and come to understand. To grasp this profound art requires more than a single day. The teachings of the **Four Lords and Three Origins** are as unchanging as true gold; the discourse on the **Five Stars and Six Luminaries** is as invaluable as fine jade. By silently observing the principles of the **Eighteen Stars** and mastering the essentials of the **Twelve Palaces**, one may discern poverty and wealth, nobility and lowliness—none can escape the scrutiny of the fortune stars.\n\n**Man receives the qi of Heaven and Earth, forming the Three Powers.**\nThose complete in Heaven, Earth, and Man are called *cheng ren* (perfected persons), and when their fate aligns with prosperity, their wealth endures without limit. Those incomplete in Heaven, Earth, and Man are called *bu cheng ren* (imperfect persons), and when their fate arrives, their wealth collapses without recourse. Generally, those unaspected by **Xu**, **Wailing**, **Punishment**, or **Blade** are complete; those afflicted by them are incomplete. When fate enters a yang palace and encounters a yang star, or enters a yin palace and encounters a yin star, each receives the harmony of Heaven’s timing. To meet the **Wailing** star in a year of avoidance is to see immediate consequences.\n\n**At birth, if the Zi and Hong noble stars reside in the life and destiny palaces,**\nthe early years bring honor and nobility, with emolument flourishing and expanding. If **Wenchang** and other stars aspect directly or reside in their proper or exalted palaces, auspicious events and joy follow. When **Tianxu** enters one’s fate, wealth and silk dissipate; wherever it aspects, misfortune and strangeness arise. When **Tianyin** enters one’s fate and occupies a position of strength in its proper palace, it brings the joy of wealth and authority. Even if not within the chart, it heralds auspicious events. To encounter **Hongluan** in one’s fate is to wed a woman of beauty or for a woman to marry a man of talent. When the **Xu** star aspects one’s fate, it brings false alarms. **Yao** and **Blade** govern water disasters; **Mao** and **Yi** govern fire calamities, exile, or forced name changes. If one’s fate encounters **Storehouse** and **Guan**, it brings sudden wealth, lifting the poor to riches. For the rest, inauspicious stars follow the guidance of the **Wenchang** star—examining the stars’ positions in their palaces provides the standard, without the slightest error.\n\nShould there be those who die at the very onset of a fate-period, or perish as it draws near, one must rely on the stars of life and death for precise judgment. If the **Tianku** star shines directly upon one’s fate and destiny, it is called the **Yellow Springs star**. If it shines directly upon the fate-period while also opposing it, this is termed the **Raging Waves fate-period**, presaging death and layer upon layer of mourning. In yang palaces, it brings much sorrow; in yin palaces, it may bring some joy. Even if it resides in its proper temple as a fortune star, one cannot escape external bereavement or the wearing of mourning for kin.\n\nThe **Raging Waves fate-period**, in another account, is said to be the **Staff, Cangue, and Wailing**—these three stars. The judgment states:\n\n*Gain and loss, poverty and prosperity are not easily fathomed,*\n*For all depend upon the palace of fate and destiny.*\n*When auspicious stars descend here, blessings abound;*\n*When baleful stars align, one meets a grim end.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*When both **Yao** and **Yi** stars shine upon one’s fate,*\n*This baleful pair portends inevitable misfortune.*\n*Breaking from one’s roots and leaving home, given to wine and lust,*\n*The man becomes a lecher, the woman a harlot.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*The **Tianku** star is most inauspicious;*\n*If it appears at the great fate-period, danger and death follow.*\n*Say not that ancestral estates will be worn away—*\n*Fear rather that one’s span of years will not be long.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*When the **Xu** and **Blade** stars aspect one’s fate,*\n*Only in forests and wilds may one find peace.*\n*For the common man who offends them, a thousand leagues of travel*\n*Will bring disaster upon disaster, one after another.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*When baleful stars afflict one amid illness,*\n*The five viscera fall into disorder, beyond boasting.*\n*Crooked back, hunched waist, and bent spine—*\n*Even if one’s years are long, fortune will not be kind.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*Of the four cardinal palaces, strength is most vital;*\n*When beneficent stars shine upon them, joy is extraordinary.*\n*But if the **Wailing** and **Blade** stars stand overhead,*\n*Bone and flesh suffer harm, and mourning knows no end.*\n*In fields and dwellings, ancestral estates are broken;*\n*For wives and concubines, injury is certain.*\n*In office and emolument, matters arise without cause;*\n*In the palace of fate, discord and strangeness prevail.*\n*From beginning to end, fortune and misfortune are foreordained—*\n*Trace them step by step, and scrutinize with care.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*The **Tianku** star is most inauspicious;*\n*Should it appear, calamity is sure to follow.*\n*Though ancestral estates may be worn away to nothing,*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, one’s years will not be long.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*Baleful stars bring wailing, the greatest of disasters;*\n*Troubles upon troubles enter the household.*\n*If the yearly fate-period encounters this baleful star,*\n*The family will witness wailing and times of decline.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*When **Punishment** and **Wailing** meet, matters are not light;*\n*If the year’s fate encounters them, false alarms arise.*\n*When fortune and emolument are at their peak, guard against childbirth calamity;*\n*People scatter, wealth disperses, and peace is lost.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*The **Tianren** star is the **Sevenfold Harm**;*\n*When it clashes with the yearly fate-period, injury and death are certain.*\n*Unless one relies on the power of hidden virtue,*\n*Disaster and heavy mourning will surely befall.*\n\n**Judgment of the Eighteen Subtle Stars**\n\nThe **Ziwei** star, also called **Purple Qi**, **Great Yang**, **Jade Hall**, or **Lesser Yang**, is close to the noble and honored. The *Jin Treatise* states: This star dwells at the center of the imperial enclosure, most exalted and noble. Auspicious stars can restrain it. When it shines with wisdom and kindness, it presides over long life and wealth. In judging its configuration:\n\nStanding alone above the gate of heaven is called **Bowing to the North Star**, presaging nobility. Residing alone in the *mao* position is called the **Emerging from Chen Configuration**, presaging great nobility. When it shines upon the body and meets with auspicious stars in attendance, this is called the **Pure Radiance Configuration**. When it is at ease in its temple, joyful in its prosperity, or in the *ji-you* temple, this is the **Temple Configuration**; in the *shen-hai* palace, joyful in *zi* prosperity, this is the **Intersecting Palace Configuration**. When one’s fate or destiny encounters it, it bestows a love of the Dao, much talent and knowledge, purple robes and golden belts, honor and esteem, with petty men kept at a distance. If one cultivates kindness and studies the Dao, one may attain the destiny of an immortal.\n\nWhen it shines upon the palace of the body, it grants emolument, a pure and upright office, literary talent, and great wisdom. Dwelling in this palace, it bestows a life of kindness and good fortune. If it does not reside in its temple or prosperity, it becomes a solitary spirit, favoring monks and Daoists who observe fasts and precepts. If it aligns with the **Blade** star, it makes one a recluse among mountains, springs, and rocks. If it meets with dark stars, it inclines one toward lust, a harsh nature, and estrangement from kin. For women, it harms the husband and children. But if it meets with auspicious spirits, it brings honor to the husband and prosperity to the children, with titles and nobility. If it loses its position, it declines and weakens, though even in peril there is deliverance, making one a person of the nine schools.\n\nIn all palace divisions, when it appears in the palace of office and emolument, it bestows high rank, a love of goodness, the planting of virtue, and unwavering adherence to propriety and righteousness. When encountered in the fate-period, it presages an audience with the ruler. This star governing one’s fate bestows an ancient countenance, a plump and full figure, a lean and tall frame, a hunched back, a dull and murky complexion with purple or crimson hues, or a yellowish-white tone. In children, it manifests as a clear, lean, and sallow appearance.\n\nThe verse says:\n\nAt *zi*:\nCourteous in manner, one becomes a guest of honor,\nRevering the worthy and despising the unkind.\nMaster of civil arts and martial strategy,\nPure and noble, one serves as a court minister.\n\nThe verse says:\n\nAt *chou*:\nIn the *chou* position, humble yet solitary,\nKin and marriage bonds seem as if nonexistent.\nWith virtue and righteousness put into practice,\nThe grand thoroughfare lies smooth and open.\n\nThe verse says:\n\nAt *yin*:\nIn the *yin* position, styled the True Person,\nYet along the way, no close companions.\nOnce aspirations lay beyond the minister’s rank,\nYet the body too has served the lord.\n\nThe verse says:\n\nAt *mao*:\nIn the *mao* position, styled the Pivot of Harmony,\nAll due to alternating cycles of solitude.\nFirst hardship, then ease,\nIn later years, the path is abundant.\n\nThe verse says:\n\nAt *chen*:\nAt *chen*, the Celestial Void,\nFame is achieved, and times are prosperous.\nMarriage and kinship are not my portion,\nWith doubled fists, one strives alone.\n\nThe verse says:\n\nAt *si*:\nAt *si*, grace is received from the world,\nFame is made in the great capital.\nBasking in the radiance of the sun’s pure light,\nHow could extraordinary merit not arise?\n\nThe verse says:\n\nAt *wu*:\nHeaven’s grace enters solitude and emptiness,\nWhere perilous winds are met.\nThough the source remains, it does not dry too soon,\nWith effort, one ascends the celestial thoroughfare.\n\nThe verse says:\n\nAt *wei*:\nPurple enters the Celestial Abyss,\nBy nature good, discerning foolish from wise.\nLofty aspirations bring midway hardship,\nYet in later years, the path shines brightly.\n\nThe verse says:\n\nAt *shen*:\nBy nature especially gentle and kind,\nWith a noble heart and far-reaching ambitions.\nMaster of civil arts and martial strategy,\nOne holds authority, guarding the frontier.\n\nThe verse says:\n\nAt *you*:\nAbove *you* shines the Purple Tenuity Star,\nDignity and bearing draw near the Most Honored.\nOne’s name stands above the master’s,\nReputation and worth mirror heaven and earth.\n\nThe verse says:\n\nAt *xu*:\nHeaven’s joy arrives at the White Ram,\nThe osmanthus of the moon sprays autumn’s fragrance.\nSuccess and failure are often experienced,\nYet in later years, the scene is surely fine.\n\nThe verse says:\n\nAt *hai*:\n*Purple* reaches the Gate of Heaven,\nA solitary self floats like a cloud.\nWorry not for one’s own affairs,\nFor one of keen insight must draw near the sovereign.\n\nThe Star of Celestial Emptiness, also called the Star of No Substance.\nWhere it shines, *kongwang* brings mourning garb, the Black Spring Road, and the Celestial End within the celestial wall—a star of ruin and loss.\nWhere it illuminates, good fortune turns ill, and misfortune brings poverty. It governs recklessness and mourning garb.\nWhen it resides in its temple and flourishes in the *chou* position of the body and fate palace, it bestows cleverness but meager fortune.\nWhere the star of falsehood and deception shines, it brings anxiety and the dissipation of wealth and silk.\nWhen conjoined with malevolent stars, it also shortens life.\nIf in its temple and flourishing with auspicious stars, as if gaining ground, one attains the rank of *yuanwailang*; if losing ground, one becomes reckless, and life is cut short.\nWhen meeting auspicious stars in the same palace, it still brings empty fame and hollow profit.\nWhen conjoined with stars of staff and blade, it governs death by law.\nWith punishment, it brings violent death; with blade, early demise; with staff, greed and cruelty; with *mao*, ruin and loss; with *yao*, licentiousness and elopement; with *ku*, solitude; with *yi*, a fondness for cunning schemes.\nIf in the palace of the body, it governs dual surnames in one lifetime and early loss of the father; for women, its appearance is inauspicious.\nIn the palace of official emolument, it brings empty fame.\nIn the palace of appearance, it averts disaster.\nIn the palace of servants, one’s wisdom is surpassed by that of a slave.\nWhen encountered in the limits of fate, matters multiply.\nWhen meeting punishment and killing stars, and the limit arrives, it becomes the Three Mounds and Five Graves—all good things in life turn to naught, and all affairs come to nothing in the end.\nIf the star of the body is afflicted by the blade of emptiness and punishment, the mother is lost early.\n\nThe verse says:\nAwakening to the Three Thousand and the Great Thousand...\n\nIn life, never be ensnared by profit or fame.\n\n**Zi (子):**\nIn the Zi position, named Celestial Emptiness,\nSchemes and plans dissolve like dreams.\nThe household foundation must be self-built,\nLivelihood drifts like tumbleweed.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Chou (丑) position, within the Dipper-Ox Palace,\nHow could the solitary Dao ever be exhausted?\nWith clarity to discern black from white,\nOne’s body abides in the path of office.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Yin (寅) position, if the Void Star resides,\nBrilliance and Dao are not one’s own.\nTo glorify ancestors,\nOne cares for oneself, not others.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Mao (卯) position, Celestial Exhaustion nears the spring,\nPeaceful dwelling is not natural.\nTempered through winter’s end,\nThe spirit grows ever more steadfast.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Chen (辰) position, granaries enter Celestial Emptiness,\nHalf a lifetime is clearly solitary.\nThough emolument is never lacking,\nOne remains bound to the road of service.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Si (巳) position, named Supreme Unity of Void and Waste,\nDetours are not born of arrogance.\nHalf a life spent in haste,\nFortune arrives only in middle age.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Wu (午) position, how could the Void Mansion flee?\nLoyal words reach the sage’s mechanism.\nWind and waves strike mid-course,\nYet in later years, all is left to action.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Wei (未) position, Jade Hall hosts Celestial Solitude,\nHow could restraints not exist?\nMarriage and kinship are not one’s own,\nFoundations and plans must be self-made.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Shen (申) position, Celestial Emptiness is called the Solitary Mansion,\nSeeking the Dao brings abundant robes and emolument.\nIf paired with the Strange,\nOne bears two surnames in a single life.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the You (酉) position, meeting the Void—do not fear toil,\nEven vast wealth may wear away.\nOnly through self-reliance does one become accomplished,\nAnd in later years, rise high.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Xu (戌) position, if auspicious stars align,\nAncestral legacy must be renewed.\nThis life’s affairs of fame and profit,\nAre pursued in two separate realms.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Hai (亥) position, one becomes a solitary child,\nSuccess and failure often wane.\nAncestral legacy exists as if it does not,\nOne must rely on self-devised measures.\n\nThe Celestial Noble Star, also called the Heavenly Unity of Primordial Peace.\nThe *Sui History* states: This star is the gate of the Purple Tenuity Palace, the spirit of Supreme Unity. It governs battle, discerns human fortune and misfortune, wields the power of authority and blessing, and restrains the stars of good and evil. It presides over nobility, literary brilliance, and erudition.\n\nWhen in its temple or prosperous palace (Chen as temple, Yin as joy, Hai as prosperity), and in the Palace of Life and Destiny, it bestows extraordinary achievements, surpassing the crowd, easy resolution of difficulties, favor from the eminent, and distance from the base. It brings renown. In this palace, it grants superior wisdom, a mind full of literature, love for the Dao, honor, and official rank with distinction.\n\nIt is also said: In youth, through strange dreams, one gains advantage. When in its temple or prosperity, with authority and the three directions in harmony, a lifetime of glory ensues. Even in the presence of killing stars, they retreat. Though hardship may arise, one is always near the noble.\n\nWhen meeting malevolent stars—Mao Head, Seal, Staff, or paired with Yao (lewdness), Ku (mourning), or Ru (blade)—or when evil aligns with punishment in the same palace, it breeds a thousand cunning schemes. If afflicted by inauspicious stars or the blade of punishment, parents meet an untimely end, and kinship lacks strength.\n\nFor women, if auspicious stars appear, they attain nobility, titles, golden crowns, and purple seals. If meeting malevolent stars, they are unkind and unjust, harming husbands and children, becoming base and vile.\n\nIn the Palace of Official Emolument, it makes one stand out, unafraid of trouble, without ill intent. When fate’s limits encounter it, there is joy and celebration.\n\nWhen the Celestial Noble guards destiny, it bestows a dignified form, a fair and round face, a broad and generous demeanor, a tall and stout frame, a square and white complexion, red lips, white teeth, a harmonious heart, and a virtuous nature—qualities befitting an official. With auspicious stars, one relies on close kin, and sibling bonds are enduring.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Zi (子) position, a star of fine literature,\nA pure heart and an even purer nature.\n\nThose who achieve fame and position do so without toil,\nTheir reputation resounds throughout the court.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Chou (丑) position, the Celestial Aid reaches Dipper and Ox,\nA pure name spreads to the four quarters.\nNo need to inherit ancestral legacy—\nMerit and profit come naturally.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Yin (寅) position, the star of nobility flourishes,\nFoundations strong and spirit vigorous.\nThough one may not ascend the lunar palace,\nTheir renown still stirs the hearts of men.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Mao (卯) position, the palace of halls and chambers,\nA nature wise and wholly righteous.\nEarly years may not bring success—\nOne must wait for late-life nobility.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Chen (辰) position, the Celestial Noble thrives in the Metal Palace,\nMind clear and nature keen.\nNot only oneself attains nobility—\nGenerations enjoy abundant rank.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Si (巳) position, the Purple Tenuity Palace,\nGlory and splendor endure from beginning to end.\nOne ascends to a position of importance,\nWith brothers and descendants excelling in learning.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Wu (午) position, the Celestial Noble stands between Kan and Li,\nMarital and familial ties fraught with peril.\nIn middle age, one illuminates ancestral legacy,\nAnd their name spreads ever farther.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Wei (未) position, imperial examinations enter the palace,\nHow could one surpass without restraint?\nBetween Kan and Li, no thorns obstruct—\nA lofty person recommends their merit.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Shen (申) position, the Celestial Noble guards Yin and Yang,\nResolute in purpose, upholding principles.\nEarly years may not bring prosperity—\nIn later years, their name resounds.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the You (酉) position, the Noble rides the Golden Ox,\nA person of refined strangeness.\nWhy fear meager clothing or emolument?\nTheir reputation echoes through the court.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Xu (戌) position, known as the Celestial Physician,\nTheir name is surely fitting.\nIn establishing oneself, one seeks noble encounters,\nGradually rising—no need for doubt.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Hai (亥) position, the Celestial Gate brims with flourishing qi,\nNeither rank nor emolument is trifling.\nSurely one becomes an extraordinary person,\nBenevolent and truly greatly noble.\n\nThe Celestial Seal Star, also called the Imperial Talisman, governs the image of commanding troops and wielding martial authority. When enshrined in the Zi (子) position, flourishing in Chen (辰), rejoicing in Mao (卯), or residing in the Life Palace, it bestows abundant power and fortune. Dwelling in this palace, one commands awe and wields heavy authority. If the Celestial Staff is present, one holds the imperial seal. When meeting auspicious stars, one may attain the destiny of an immortal—or at least ascend to the highest ministerial rank. When meeting malevolent stars, one delights in official posts. With additional anomalies, one may be born of a concubine or lose both parents early. With the Staff and Hair, one holds power. With Punishment, one is cruel and harsh. With Yao, one is licentious. With the Blade, one is orphaned. With Lamentation, one is solitary. When in its proper place, one inherits ancestral legacy; when not, there is no inheritance. When fate’s limits encounter it, one may be swiftly promoted. For women, it grants a sharp appearance and a virtuous nature. In the Palace of Official Emolument, others respect and submit. In the Palace of Wives and Concubines, one’s wife brings wealth. When fate’s flow aligns with its presence, one attains promotion to a prominent position. When the yearly limit meets it, one gains renown, with a person of refined and intelligent appearance, a medium build, and a clear, fair complexion.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Zi (子) position, enshrined, it bestows authority,\nA benevolent and magnanimous aura.\n\nThe course of action and concealment is ultimately predestined; observe its dwelling in days to come.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Chou (丑) position, the Seal Star approaches the Dipper constellation—\nFame and profit may initially prove difficult.\nIn middle age, one must plan far ahead,\nFor even unto death, honor cannot be attained.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Yin (寅) position, the Seal resides in the Human-and-Horse wall—\nEncountering it, the aura is magnanimous.\nOne’s foundation must rely on ancestors,\nYet good opportunities arise of their own accord.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Mao (卯) position, Mao approaches the Mao office—\nTemperament and nature are gentle and kind.\nOne’s livelihood should not depend on ancestors;\nOnly through self-reliance does brilliance begin to shine.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Chen (辰) position, the Seal falls into the Chen palace—\nThough perilous, it does not reach misfortune.\nThe foundation must stand alone,\nAnd in old age, the household flourishes.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Si (巳) position, this star lies in the realm of severance—\nFamily fortunes begin in solitude and poverty.\nWithout the support of marriage or kin,\nOnly in later years does spring arrive.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Wu (午) position, the Seal Star inclines toward Wu—\nUpright yet beset by many disputes.\nAction and concealment must find peace,\nYet affairs sought come but slowly.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Wei (未) position, the Seal’s origin favors relocation—\nAs if not confined to a chessboard’s bounds.\nOpportunities may yet fail,\nAnd only in late life does all become fitting.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Shen (申) position, one delves into the mysteries of yin and yang—\nIn middle age, strength is surely attained.\nThrough one’s own efforts, profit and renown arise,\nAnd in old age, fragrance endures.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the You (酉) position, the Seal enters the Metal Ox office—\nGains and losses drift like distant clouds.\nKnowing fate, one guards with care,\nAnd only then may the path of poverty be planned.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Xu (戌) position, the Celestial Seal enters the White Ram—\nThe heart’s terrain expands broadly.\nTo honor oneself, one must stand alone,\nAnd not treat this as commonplace.\n\n*Verse:*\nIn the Hai (亥) position, the Celestial Auspice appears—\nBrilliant and clear, the Dao and righteousness flourish.\nBreaking through the osmanthus of the moon,\nOne becomes a pillar of the court.\n\nThe Star of Longevity, also called the Old Man or Venerable Father.\nWhen this star resides in the south, it is the Old Man Star; when guarding the wall formation, it governs long life.\nIn the Hai palace, it is at its temple; in You, at its peak; in Yin, at ease—within the life palace, it bestows high fortune and extended years, a love of goodness and hidden virtue, with blessings in old age.\nDwelling in this palace, one gains fortune through longevity; when in temple or at peak, it is especially noble.\nIf residing in You, one is free from disaster from youth.\nWith the Staff, one holds authority; with the Fur, one breaks from ancestors; with Punishment, one governs the punishment palace.\nIn a fallen palace, early death; when guarding the Void, Separation, or Lamentation, it is inauspicious.\nWhen the main star aligns with its influence, one may die within three days.\nWhen the Longevity Star meets Lamentation or Void, it is called \"fallen and weak,\" and longevity is never attained.\nFor women, it brings good fortune.\nThe four stars—Void, Separation, Blade, and Lamentation—govern early death, as well as harm to flesh and blood, adoption, or marrying into another family.\nIn the Palace of Official Emolument, one acts with foresight and compassion.\nWhen the yearly limit is free from inauspicious stars’ interference or entanglement, it brings double honor in fortune and nobility.\nThe person is tall, with a composed appearance, an ancient and steadfast character, selfless in action, patient\n\nAt Wu, one is called \"Elegant and Solitary Listener,\" with a lofty name that admits no decline.\nShould one inquire when official rank and fame will be achieved, look to the time when the hair turns white.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nAt Wei, one does not enter the village of Wei to seek fame and profit, for such pursuits are slow to unfold.\nOnly after enduring trials and tempering does one’s name become fragrant in later years.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nAt Shen, the aged see the Kun Palace, where achievements in career and enterprise are hard to accomplish.\nFlowers bloom and wither again, yet the roots remain abundant in old age.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nAt You, longevity enters the You Palace, and one may ultimately reach the celestial thoroughfare.\nOfficial rank and fame must be attained independently; promotion need not be sought.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nAt Xu, the White Sheep and Fish Stars rest securely, and one’s life and fate are certain to gain office.\nWith both fame and profit, why fear the many difficulties of affairs?\n\n**Tuan says:**\nAt Hai, the flourishing palace of the Morning Court, the talented and outstanding are composed in nature.\nTheir writings crown the world, and by middle age, their positions are exalted.\n\nThe Red Bird Star, also known as the Great Yin, Heavenly Surprise, Auspicious Phoenix, and Crying Phoenix.\nWhen this star is propitious, it is the Red Bird; when enraged, it becomes Ketu.\nAs a star near the imperial court, it governs official emolument.\nIn terms of structural patterns: when positioned at Hai, it forms the \"Moon Illuminating the Celestial Gate\" pattern, indicating nobility.\nWhen the Red Bird enters its temple, and the Emolument Origin shines upon the life and fate palaces, it forms the \"Dragon Gate High Promotion\" pattern, signifying nobility.\nWhen the temple is joyful and the star flourishes in the official palace, or when in the Chou temple it meets the \"Entering Temple\" pattern and shines upon the life and fate palaces, it governs a gentle nature, clear dignity, a love for fine clothing, indulgence in wine and sensual pleasures, fondness for friends, and much support from yin persons, as well as attracting a wealthy wife.\nResiding in this palace, one is gentle in nature, with a refined and courteous appearance, beautiful and elegant, composed in action, and fond of fine delicacies.\nIf met by malevolent stars and afflicted by the Rod, one is fierce in nature and holds authority.\nIf afflicted by the Hair, one is lewd and lustful.\nIf afflicted by the Blade, one brings disgrace upon others.\nIf afflicted by the Strange, one abandons ancestors, and women may become unchaste or turn to prostitution.\nIf afflicted by Yao, one becomes a jealous wife; if not expanding, one suffers hardship or becomes a concubine.\nMen afflicted by Punishment face peril in achieving fame, but early loss of attendants and reliance on flesh and blood may lead to punishment.\nIf all stars are favorably positioned, one’s talents stand out, capable of governing the realm for the state, with learning surpassing others and the ability to manage enterprises.\nIf the stars are unfavorably positioned, one may enter the empty gate (monastic life) and endure hardship.\nIf afflicted by Yao and Hair, one indulges in wine and sensual pleasures.\nIf in decline, one achieves nothing.\nWomen are beautiful but hot-tempered, with yin toxicity, and may receive titles.\nWhen the temple is joyful and the star flourishes, one is perceptive, discerning, and skilled in household management, with a cheerful nature.\nIf met by auspicious stars, one is noble; if met by malevolent stars, one is unvirtuous.\nWhen entering the temple, one is born following an extraordinary dream.\nIn the Palace of Official Emolument, one delights in rites, music, benevolence, and righteousness, acting not recklessly and holding authority.\nWhen seen in the Palace of Brothers, one’s sons and nephews achieve success.\nWhen encountered in the cycles of fortune and yearly limits, extraordinary blessings arise.\nOne is handsome and elegant, intelligent and clever, graceful and amiable.\nOf the three—romance, wine, and gambling—one is certain to indulge in at least one.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nWhen the Red Bird guards the life palace, the face is square, the brows and eyes distinct, a handsome gentleman.\nWith red lips and white teeth, one’s life is gentle yet firm.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nWomen most favor the Great Yin Star, with intelligence, resourcefulness, and a clear nature.\nTheir moods are unpredictable and hard to provoke; they can attract noble sons and bring honor to their husbands.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nAt Zi, the Auspicious Phoenix brings scholarly honor, holding power with a certain reputation.\nThroughout life, one faces no peril, leaping over the three layers of Yu’s waves.\n\n**Chou**\nThough one’s appearance be plain, nobility knows no peer—wealth and rank both have their causes.\nFret not the dangers ahead; you shall stride smoothly into the radiance of a wise lord.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Yin**\nIn Yin, one excels in dignity, with a nature that soars by heaven’s design.\nFriends delight in wine and beauty; elegance and refinement are freely bestowed.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Mao**\nIn Mao, the Red Bird brings joy—mind clear, courage bold, and ambition soaring.\nThough not inheriting ancestral literary grace, one rises to exalted rank with solemn grandeur.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Chen**\nIn Chen, the golden chessboard awaits—proudly stands the true man.\nStillness is not mere stillness; in quiet seclusion, one delights in boundless freedom.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Si**\nIn Si, the position is called Celestial Fullness—a solitary jade, ruled by the moon’s light.\nYet mark how loyalty and integrity endure; in twilight years, glory shall at last unfold.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Wu**\nThe Red Bird claims the Wu position—women ever find their wishes fulfilled.\nMen proceed in steady course; by middle age, honor and nobility arrive.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Wei**\nThe Bird enters the realm of the Great Crab—solitary, yet two daughters attend.\nHouseholds stand divided; yet in old age, splendor redoubles.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Shen**\nThe Bird does not enter Shen’s domain—renown remains unproclaimed.\nWives are hindered, children thwarted; kin part early as stars of Shen and Shang.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**You**\nIn You, the Red Bird appears—yet joy remains incomplete.\nHousehold fortunes rise and fall; good fortune only then finds its circle.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Xu**\nThe Bird enters the White Ram’s home—fond of wine, fond of flowers.\nThough midlife brings blessings, late years shine even more resplendent.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Hai**\nIn Hai, all accords with human desire—climbing high into the forest of feathered scholars.\nNature knows no bias; in later years, prosperity advances swiftly.\n\nThe Star of the Celestial Treasury, also called the Auspicious Star of Heavenly Wealth.\nThe *Book* states: It is assisted by the Right Assistant, known otherwise as the Handle of the Northern Dipper’s Ladle, or the Auspicious Treasury of Heaven.\nLocated at the left corner of Lou, it serves as the armory’s repository.\nDwelling within the Purple Tenuity, it is the divine treasury of the Jade Palace.\nAll treasures, weapons, and reparations depend upon it.\nExalted in Wu, prosperous in Hai, joyous in Ji, delighting in Mao and Wei—when it resides in the Palaces of Life or Destiny, it bestows wealth, nobility, riches, and abundant fields and estates.\nIf one’s life or destiny aligns with it, nobility may reach the highest councils.\nAs an official, it governs wealth, yet harms others to benefit oneself.\nWhen conjoined with auspicious stars of staff and seal, it confers nobility.\nWith few seals of authority, it brings wealth and rank; it delights in the Star of Heavenly Punishment to generate fortune.\nWhen paired with punishment and staff, it grants power; with the Star of Hair, it severs ancestral ties.\nConjoined with solitary stars, it scatters gatherings—such a one may be called a virtuous idler.\nWith the Star of Strangeness, it indicates a child of a concubine who alters lineage, or one who marries into a peculiar family.\nWith the Star of Weeping and Punishment, it harms parents, and siblings become as distant as Chu and Qin.\nWith the Star of Yao, it breeds lust.\nWith the Star of the Blade, it brings violent death—unless countered by a pressing illness or a protective shell, one may drown in waves.\nFor women, its presence ensures grace, abundant fortune, and mastery of inner chambers’ decorum.\nWith the Star of Yao, it portends secret affairs.\nIn the Palace of Official Emolument, it governs talent, calculation, and wisdom.\nWhen transits illuminate it, wealth arrives—if poor, sudden riches; one’s physique becomes robust.\nWomen afflicted by the Stars of Hair or Strangeness face peril in childbirth.\nFor both men and women, it governs the lung meridian, leading to wheezing and fullness—wealth may invite disaster.\nAll else follows accordingly.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n\nThough the Celestial Treasury is called the Solitary Spirit,\nWhen auspicious stars converge, fame arises.\nMost joyous is deliverance in peril—\nA life of leisure, a man of ease.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Zi:** The Celestial Treasury faces the Treasure Vase,\nWandering with false alarms.\nYet when appearance shifts, one stands alone;\nAll schemes and plans shall surely prosper.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Chou:** The Treasury enters Chou, solitary and estranged—\nBeware the child and wife.\nMidway, all turns naturally peaceful;\nIn later years, fortune arrives in season.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Yin:** The Celestial Treasury is named the Star of Wealth,\nYet solitude and harm must not be heeded.\nThe foundation was never good—\nOnly through striving does honor come.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Mao:** Shadowed solitude, the heart grows hollow,\nYet windfall wealth abounds.\nPlans must be laid by one’s own hand;\nIn the end, one dwells in the abyss.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Chen:** The Celestial Treasury fares well in Chen,\nThough glory remains obscure.\nLike duckweed, one drifts through lands—\nOnly in late years does prosperity flourish.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Si:** The Treasury enters Si, strong and firm,\nIts roots and shell enduring.\nWith benevolence and no deceit,\nOne’s name naturally shines.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Wu:** The Celestial Treasury arrives in Li,\nIts form and manner upright and gentle.\nWith magnanimity and no selfishness,\nGlory, splendor, and abundant fortune follow.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Wei:** When it descends upon Wei in life and fate,\nBenevolence crowns all others.\nOnly in middle age does strength arise;\nIn old age, one shall serve the lord.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Shen:** In Shen, the Celestial Treasury meets the Star of Radiance,\nYet wandering brings no ease.\nOne roams the world—\nOnly upon return does age bring maturity.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**You:** The Treasury Star resides in You,\nIts depths obscure—yet how could there be no achievement?\nSuccess does not come from ancestors;\nWhen the time comes, one stands in clarity.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Xu:** The Celestial Treasury enters the White Ram,\nThe household’s fortunes must transform.\nWith kindness and no greed or cruelty,\nOne’s reputation spreads far and wide.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Hai:** The Treasury Star descends upon Hai,\nOne establishes the family’s renown.\nA name above the multitude—\nWhat fear of failing to achieve great deeds?\n\n*Purple Star Astrology, Scroll Two Concludes*\n*Purple Star Astrology, Scroll Three*\n\n**Chain Lock Star**, also called the **Treasure Vault**, is the deity of the linked rope. Its alternate names include: **Sudden Wealth**, **Entangling Snare**, **Long Cord**, **Celestial Pardon**, **Celestial Net**, and **Ketu**. This star bears eight names and resides before the Northern Dipper, governing law and restraining violence. When its gate opens, it brings litigation and imprisonment; when it bestows grace, it heralds sudden joy and favorable configurations. The **Entangling Star** presides over penal bonds. If it conjoins the **Body** or **Destiny Palace**, it forms the **Linked-Rope Body-Penalty Configuration**, inviting idle troubles and disputes. When exalted in **Wei**, at peak strength in **Ji**, or joyous in **Hai**, **Mao**, or **Wu**, it bestows abundant wealth upon the Body or Destiny Palace. If it illuminates the Body, Destiny, or annual luck periods, it ensures ample resources, yet one remains entangled in worldly concerns, unable to find peace.\n\nWhenever this star aligns with the **Celestial Treasury** in any palace, and auspicious stars converge, misfortune deepens—yet sudden pardons may dissolve calamities like water. If it meets the **Luan Penalty**, wealth flourishes; if it encounters malevolent stars, litigation multiplies. When afflicted by **Blade** or **Violence**, it portends unnatural death, lewdness, or dissipation. If **Weeping** or **Staff** stars join, early demise follows. Under the influence of evil stars, it brings hanging, suspension, lightning strikes, beast attacks, drifting corpses, maimed limbs, or shattered bodies—leading to a life of toil, devoid of transcendence, marked by pettiness and stinginess.\n\nIn the **Official Fortune Palace**, when aligned with the **Celestial Treasury** and embraced by luck periods, it ensures sudden prosperity. If malevolent stars intervene, separation and disputes arise. For women, the same applies—beware of death in childbirth or ruin through lust, though they may excel in household management.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nThough the Celestial Treasury is called a solitary spirit,\nWhen auspicious stars converge, fame arises.\nMost fortunate is deliverance from peril—\nA life of refined leisure, serene and untroubled.\n\n**Zi:** Earth excess brings rise and fall—\nBlack Paths breed sorrow, resentment, and venomous husbands,\nYet they hoard every trifling gain, accumulating surplus.\n\n**Chou:** Self-made success—\nYet loneliness and hardship prevail, severing ties with kin,\nLike a chicken’s beak, ever grasping, heedless of windfalls.\n\n**Yin:** Sudden demise—\nCurses and malice abound, lacking kindness or filial duty,\nSeeing profit, they forget old pacts, betraying virtue for gain.\n\n**Mao:** Wealthy yet afflicted—\nLame limbs, wind-borne ailments, devoid of warmth or propriety,\nLacking human decency, their conduct befits beasts, without the depth of water or wood.\n\n**Chen:** First ruin, then success—\nMourning and misfortune at the door, thunderous shocks from tigers.\nProceed with utmost care—only cautious alliances ensure strength,\nUnsought blessings arrive late, like a caged bird.\n\n**Si:** Established amidst peril—\nThe power of seals and emoluments, the image of official rank,\nJoy in the Taiyi Palace: tigers retreat, halls stand secure,\nThe lord’s favor brings the minister’s peace, their virtue renowned in the court.\n\n**Wu:** The Star flourishes in Wu—\nWealth and emoluments remain unscathed, yet wife and children become illusions.\nEvil conjunctions invite calamity; auspicious rays meet obstruction,\nThey chase trifles, unaware of impending betrayal.\n\n**Wei:** Solitary and scattered, yet gathering—\nPenal bonds and solitude sever ties with kin,\nWithout malevolent stars, fortune prevails—yet the heart strays from the law,\nThe body pursues profit, lost in its path.\n\n**Shen:** Aligned with the Killing Palace—\nSchemes and poisons lurk in shadows, harming without loss of fortune,\nSelf-inflicted ruin, tainting the good with filth.\n\n**You:** Self-made in You—\nWhen the Chain Lock enters the Earth Palace, wives and concubines grow estranged,\nMothers are doomed, mourning arrives—\nFortune and misfortune diverge, their fates mournful.\n\n**Xu:** Hardship in Xu—\nThe Celestial Right Star nears nobility, bestowing robes and emoluments,\nYet evil may lead to self-strangulation—\nHow different is this from burglary? What separates it from robbery?\n\n**Hai:** Pure and noble in Hai—\nA wandering official’s fortune, the blessings of solitude and emptiness,\nIn the realm of the Double Fish, when Body and Destiny converge,\nAffairs of the Golden Horse and Jade Hall unfold.\n\n**Literary Star**, also called the **Terrace Assistant**, governs imperial examinations, scholarly brilliance, and literary grace. Known as **Tiankui**, **Three Terraces**, **Phoenix Pavilion**, **Celestial Marvel**, **Wenqu**, and the **Six Officers of the Southern Dipper**, it presides over nobility, learning, and celestial emoluments. In configurations, when **Wenqu** is exalted or at peak strength, it forms the **Laurel and Kui Ascendancy**. When joyous in **Wu** or **Xu** within the Body or Destiny Palace, it bestows later literary excellence, high ranks, and the path to generalship or ministerial office. When exalted and illuminating any palace, it grants eloquence and literary talent, ensuring success in imperial examinations. In exaltation, it bestows extraordinary intellect, mastery of classical texts, and the potential for generalship or ministerial roles. Wherever it resides, affairs are conducted with elegance. When meeting auspicious stars, it heralds great nobility and literary fame. If malevolent stars intervene, early ambitions falter, and one may be born of a concubine. Afflicted by **Blade** or **Penalty**, it breeds arrogance and cruelty. Under **Blade**, it brings malice, harm to parents, discord among siblings, and a life of emptiness. With **Mao Tou**, it severs ancestral ties. Under **Penalty**, it fosters ruthlessness, inviting disaster. With **Weeping**, it brings harm and loss. With **Yao Yi**, it leads to licentiousness. Even when conjoined with other stars, it is called a solitary spirit. In its place of strength, it bestows unmatched purity and nobility, benevolence, integrity, and unwavering trust. Out of its element, it breeds arrogance, aloofness, reclusion, and solitude. For women, it incites lust. With **Mao** or **Yao Yi**, it marks a base and vulgar person; with **Penalty** or **Blade**, cruelty ensues.\n\nIn the **Official Fortune Palace**, it fosters propriety and blessings, avoiding idle matters. In the **Servants Palace**, intelligence falls short of the servants’. In the **Children Palace**, meeting celestial nobility ensures descendants’ prominence. When illuminating luck periods or annual cycles, all is auspicious.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Zi:** Solitary in Zi, marriage delayed—\nIf the wife arrives early, long life is forfeit.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Chou:** In Chou, fame shines—\nEven if not noble, wealth is assured.\nIn later years,\nGreat talents come to fruition.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Yin:** Wenqu sits in Yin—\nWho can match its brilliance?\nWith auspicious stars converging,\nFortune unfolds naturally.\n\n**Mao:** In Mao, the **Academy Star** resides—\nVain and perilous, fame remains unseen.\nTalent blooms like a dream,\nOnly in old age does affection arise.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n\n**Chen:** In Chen, emotions run fierce and proud,\nSolitary and lofty, reputation soars.\nIf the **Four Cardinal Stars** align,\nGreed and cruelty shall not endure.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n\n**Si:** A refined and literary star,\nBody solitary, nature pure.\nShould it fall into noble hands,\nMarriage drifts like duckweed on water.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n\n**Wu:** In Wu, ascending to **Celestial Terrace**,\nMeeting others brings wealth.\nName fragrant as osmanthus,\nGolden seal gleams beneath the **Three Sophoras**.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n\n**Wei:** In Wei, known for solitude,\nThough lofty, the heart remains carefree.\nStrange branches yet bear fruit,\nMonks and Daoists find purity and fortune.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n\n**Shen:** In Shen, the **Solitary Star** dwells,\nA bright mind ensures honor.\nCultivating literature brings wealth,\nEven in old age, prosperity endures.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n\n**You:** In You, the fate is kind,\nUpholding goodness with auspicious stars.\nOtherwise, as monk or Daoist,\nRobes of purple bring glory.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n\n**Xu:** The **White Ram** finds its place,\nReputation spreads far and wide.\nEntering the court, three ranks await,\nExiting, military command beckons.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n\n**Hai:** The **Literary Star** stands strong,\nEven misfortune cannot harm.\nPity the heavy bones,\nFor late in life, foundations flourish.\n\nThe **Celestial Fortune Star**, named **Shanxiang**, is the **Imperial Decree’s Auspicious Spirit**. This star, among the three lodges of **Fang** and **Xu**, aligns with the northern and southern **Dipper**. It governs **imperial carriages**, **public affairs**, **sacrificial rites**, and the offices of **Minister** and **Attendant**. It signifies **lofty brilliance** and **profound fortune**. When exalted in **Mao**, flourishing in **Yin**, or joyous in **Shen** within the **Life Palace**, it grants **longevity**, **minimal illness**, **success in endeavors**, and **ninefold contentment**, with **yin forces** aiding. In **high and strong palaces**, it ensures **late-life blessings**, **fulfillment of desires**, and **sevenfold abilities**, enabling **benevolence toward others** and **benefit to all things**. Even with malevolent stars in the same palace, danger brings no peril. Meeting **Mao Yi** suggests **adoption**, **bedchamber inheritance**, or **two families cohabiting**. With **Yao**, fortune mingles with lewdness; with **Mao**, wandering; with **Blade**, cruelty and poison; with **Punishment**, venomous disputes; with **Staff**, frequent beatings; with **Weeping**, orphanhood, **lightning strikes**, **drowning in waves**, **financial ruin**, **beastly harm**, or **loss of ground and power**. For women, its presence is auspicious, but with **Yao**, **Yi**, **Mao**, or **Blade**, it marks **base and corrupt individuals**, leading to **disasters from lust** or **hanging in childbirth**. Beware. In the **Official Fortune Palace**, it ensures **orderly governance**, not recklessness. In the **Migration Palace**, it brings **fulfillment in travel**. When illuminating luck periods or annual cycles, it heralds **smooth success**.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Zi:** Fortune dwells in the **Precious Vase**,\nLivelihood awaits its time.\nAmidst danger, danger yet remains—\nPity the hollow name and profit.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Chou:** In Chou, the **Fortune Star** descends,\nYouth often brings calamity.\nThe household must stand on its own,\nClassics and histories all arranged.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Mao:** **Celestial Fortune** enters **Yin Palace**,\nWith **Staff** and **Blade**, nobility nears.\nYouthful ambitions may falter,\nBut late in life, all shall align.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Yin:** Fortune befits the **Mao** and **Yin**,\nConcealment or display, as one pleases.\nWhy fear obscurity in office?\nOld age shall bring wonders.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Chen:** Dwelling in Chen, it brings **rain and moisture**,\nYet fears malevolent stars.\nFame without greed or cruelty,\nA heart ever bound to **Dao** and **virtue**.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Si:** Fortune enters the **Golden Enclosure**,\nIntelligent, nature broad and kind.\nCompassionate, loving all things,\nIn youth, it commands the court.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Wu:** An old tree blooms late,\nEarly years bring no renown.\nWith **Prosperity** and **Seal** in place,\nWhy fear unfulfilled desires?\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Wei:** The **Fortune Star** comes to Wei,\nWhen shall swift advancement arrive?\nWithout malevolent stars,\nWhite-haired strength endures.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Shen:** **Celestial Fortune** enters **flourishing life**,\nWhy fear lack of emolument?\nFame and profit come not by chance,\nHigh authority sees waters clear.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**You:** In You, the **Fortune Star** adds,\nLike a flower in the ravine.\nIf **Punishment** or **Yi** assist,\nGrinding flour becomes livelihood.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Xu:** The **White Ram Palace** excels,\nHousehold rich with fields and cattle.\nGreat enterprises flourish,\nLongevity leads to **ducal rank**.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Hai:** In Hai, the **Fortune Star** blazes,\nEmpty glory, no true attainment.\nBuilding a family has its share,\nYet good fortune remains distant.\n\nThe **Celestial Emolument Star**, called the **Three Terraces**, assists the **Celestial Kitchen**, **Celestial Wealth**, **Celestial Treasury**, and **Father’s Treasure**. Its star, in the northeast as the **Axe Bird**, is named **Lu Yuan**, governing **prosperous affairs**. Within the **enclosure**, it is the **root of fortune** and the **source of life**, signifying **official emolument** and **auspiciousness**. In **form**, when **Punishment**, **Clash**, **Breaking**, or **Disconnection** occur, or when **Lu** is **exalted in Si**, **templed in Shen**, or **active in Mao**, with **Life Palace in Shen or Mao**, it denotes **benevolence and moderation**. Residing here, **official emolument** arrives unbidden, **wealth and silk** abound. **Enclosing** the **Life Palace** with **nobility**, and free from malevolent stars, it heralds **great nobility**. If ill stars align, one becomes **mediocre**. Meeting **virtuous stars** and **literary stars**, it brings **refined office**. With **Mao**, **civil and military talent**, yet **wealth dissipates**; with **Xu**, **empty fame** and **empty examinations**; with **Yi**, **solitude**; with **Blade**, **slaughter**; with **Yao**, **lewdness**, **quick temper**, and **venom**; in **temple**, **favored concubines**; with **Punishment**, **shouting fortune**, **straightforward nature inciting resentment**, **half-lost limbs**, **estranged siblings**, and **wife meeting misfortune**. For women, it brings **husband’s honor**, **children’s nobility**, and **wealthy ease**. With **Mao** and **Yi**, **multiple marriages**; with **Yao**, **captivity**; with **Staff** or **Blade**, **early death**; with **Weeping**, **hanging**, **self-strangulation**, or **childbirth calamity**; with **Fortune** and **Purple Phoenix**, **profound fortune**, **titles**, and **honors for sons and daughters**. In the **Official Fortune Palace**, it is most auspicious, ensuring **wealth** and **thriving enterprise**. When illuminating luck periods or annual cycles, it brings **unexpected fortune**.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Celestial Emolument** graces the body—no difficulty,\nHigh halls and grand mansions enjoy tranquility.\n\nWhen suddenly obscured by dark stars, one spends years in toil and obscurity.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Zi (Rat):** By nature refined, scholarly, and praiseworthy.\nThough not greatly wealthy, late years bring glory and splendor.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Chou (Ox):** Fortune arrives in the Metal Ox—yet fame and profit languish.\nAfter others’ years pass, hardship governs all schemes.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Yin (Tiger):** Fortune resides in the Human Horse—heroic and elegant.\nWealth flows ceaselessly; late years bring esteem.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Mao (Rabbit):** A person of fair renown, honored, wealthy, and pure.\nFate brings many encounters—what worry remains unmet?\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Chen (Dragon):** Fortune comes to the Dragon’s treasury, with achievements ever-growing.\nMarriage and kin are not my portion; a man must stand strong alone.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Si (Snake):** The Snake’s position grants dignity; glory comes in later years.\nLife flows without obstruction—cast the line by the fishing rock.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Wu (Horse):** Fortune does not leave the Southern Fire; seek fame and await the hour.\nLate years bring livelihood settled—most have good foundations.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Wei (Goat):** Fortune’s origin lies in the Goat—empty praise yet high promotion.\nEver seeking kindred spirits, eyes strain for their arrival.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Shen (Monkey):** Fortune in the Monkey’s position stands firm; glory and wealth rise higher.\nMidlife brings career success; prayers bring long, serene life.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**You (Rooster):** Fortune’s path tilts and falters—its course remains uncertain.\nIf met by auspicious stars, there will be times of contentment.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Xu (Dog):** Fortune enters the White Sheep’s land—lofty heart, solitary body.\nOnly when rank is attained does satisfaction come, a fleeting comfort in old age.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Hai (Pig):** Fortune’s origin dwells in the Pig’s position—temperament most serene.\nKin drift like duckweed; late years bring harmony and joy.\n\nThe **Celestial Staff Star**, called **Litigation**, governs penal affairs, attended by **Xuan Shu** (the Dark Warrior), presiding over nets, punishments, and imprisonment. In structural analysis, if the **Celestial Staff** stands alone in the **Official Fortune Palace**, it forms the **Official’s Staff Constellation**, bringing frequent humiliation, disaster, and misfortune. When exalted in **Zi (Rat)**, **Shen (Monkey)**, or **Hai (Pig)**, or in its own palace of **Wei (Goat)**, it brings entanglement in legal nets and punishments—unless rescued by benevolent stars. If afflicted by **Execution** or malignant stars in the same palace, it brings death by beating, or else violent ends: mauling, tiger attack, lightning strike, drowning, or wolf-inflicted wounds. In this palace with **Blade**, it brings violent death; the person is reckless, defiant, and brutally strong-willed. Even when exalted in noble positions, it brings harsh punishments and failure to attain rank. When conjoined with malevolent stars, it brings bloodshed and harm; the person is quick to anger and often beaten. If met by the **Celestial Seal** in the same palace, it grants authority and eminence. With **Purple Fortune**, it brings nobility and longevity, wielding benevolent power and high esteem. When in its **Treasury** and well-placed, it brings wealth and authority. With **Noble Person** in exaltation, it brings fortune and long life. With **Luan**, it brings refined elegance. With **Literary Star**, it brings solitude. With malevolent stars and **Punishment**, it harms parents and maims limbs. With **Quarrel**, it brings strife with spouse and heirs; kin offer little support, bonds lack affection—so too for men and women. With **Yao**, it brings lust; with **Deception**, cunning; with **Weeping**, a fractious nature. With **Blade**, it brings legal execution. For women, it brings a stern, forthright nature, capable in affairs. With auspicious stars, it turns ominous; with **Mao** or **Yi**, it brings remarriage. For men, it brings departure from ancestral home to stand alone. With **Punishment**, it brings misfortune, inciting lawsuits and inviting trouble. When transits or annual cycles align with it, if well-placed, it grants authority; if ill-placed, it brings litigation—its effects are divinely precise.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Zi (Rat):** Zi embodies celestial might, endowed with towering dignity.\nWithout inauspicious stars, one strides the heavenly steps.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Chou (Ox):** Chou is celestial thunder, fame resounding far.\nWith cautious diligence, even monks and Daoists thrive.\n\n**Yin (Tiger):** When the **Rod** enters Yin, the heart and nature are keen and bright. With auspicious stars, fortune follows; through toil, skill is achieved.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Mao (Rabbit):** Mao’s position is one of human clash, yet with **Seal**, great prosperity flows. In its subtle, far-reaching applications, success comes only after hardship.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Chen (Dragon):** Dwelling in Chen, the **Rod** brings misfortune; through labor alone is success achieved. On the post road, life flourishes, and official matters surely prosper.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Si (Snake):** Si’s position is not to be boasted of—though lofty, the self remains unadorned. Near success, failure often follows; one’s livelihood is tangled as hemp.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Wu (Horse):** The **Celestial Tiger** enters Wu, bound by toil and hardship. The foundation must be renewed; in old age, it may yet be mended.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Wei (Goat):** The **Great Fullness** enters Wei’s palace, with a romantic, discerning nature. Early years bring disorder; in later life, one ascends to prosperity.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Shen (Monkey):** In Shen, there is an **Excess Star**; with **Seal**, longevity and fortune at last flourish. With a calm heart, obstacles yield; in court and hall, one appears composed.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**You (Rooster):** You brings calamity; only with auspicious stars does strength arise. Whether in right or wrong, success or failure, one drifts like duckweed to foreign lands.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Xu (Dog):** Xu is called the **Distressed Wanderer**; to meet it is to invite chaos. What is built is also broken; only in old age does one begin anew.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Hai (Pig):** The **Supply Star** enters Hai’s palace, its qi and tuan entirely at ease. In its subtle, far-reaching applications, fame is won and great merit achieved.\n\n---\n\nThe **Celestial Anomaly Star** is also named **Separation, Ruin, Foundation-Breaker, Controller of Strange Omens, Celestial Solitude, Anomalous Womb, Earthly Plunder, Iron Axe, Controller of Strange Portents**. It governs the aberrations and disorders of heaven and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, as well as the monstrous births of birds, beasts, grasses, and trees. Those born in the southern ruins often study strange and uncanny matters, their fortunes rising and falling unpredictably. It delights in the Chen, Chou, Wei, and Mao palaces of the **Body** and **Destiny**—here, it severs ancestral ties and severs one from home. When its double influence shines upon a palace, it brings separation and change of surname. If it aligns with benevolent stars in a flourishing or exalted position, fortune follows. But if it shares a palace with malevolent stars in a debilitated position, it breeds deceit, poor judgment of others, and lack of respect. Yet in flourishing positions, it remains auspicious, indicating a fate of illegitimate birth. With malevolent stars, it brings great upheaval; with auspicious stars, unexpected joy. When it enters a flourishing position, it bestows nobility. If it directly illuminates, one may still gain a wife’s wealth. With auspicious constellations, it tightens the bonds of rank, spreading fame across the land. When it meets **Nobility** in a strong position, one’s name blazes with glory, though often accompanied by licentiousness. With **Wenchang**, it brings reputation, but early setbacks. With **Luan**, it brings charm; with **Fortune and Emolument**, enjoyment; with **Seal and Longevity**, power, fortune, and cunning. With **Treasury and Wealth**, sudden rise and swift pursuit; with malevolent stars and **Emptiness**, treachery, deceit, and shamelessness. With **Yao** and the **Nine Punishments**, cruelty and harm befall parents, siblings become like enemies, spouses part, children are lost—like gold in sand, so too for men and women. For women, it brings elopement. In the **Official Career** palace, it brings unusual wealth, but affairs are ever-changing. It should not appear in the **Spouse** palace, where it brings separation and loss, harming the three palaces, leaving one as if nonexistent, beset by illness. With **Yao**, it brings strange ailments. In the **Fields and Estates** palace, it destroys ancestral property. In the **Wealth** palace, it dissipates resources. When encountered in annual cycles or transits, it brings shocking anomalies, misfortune, and financial loss.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nWhen the **Rod** and **Anomaly** align to illuminate the **Destiny** palace, one changes name and surname, finding joy in shared fate. If not an adopted child or born of a concubine, one may yet see parents twice over.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nWhen the **Celestial Anomaly** resides in a flourishing position, all ventures prosper. Plans and undertakings succeed as wished; one must surely innovate and transform the family gate.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Zi (Rat):** Abandoning ancestors, it is called the **Jade Pool Star**—nature is clever and bright, gaining emolument from the northwest. If it meets malevolent stars, disaster and illness follow. For Daoists and monks, it brings long life; it severs ancestral ties.\n\n**Chou (Ox):** One goes forth to meet noble admiration, with literary fame. If malevolent stars clash or illuminate, it brings disaster, illness, and harm—sons are unfilial, daughters unvirtuous.\n\n**Yin (Tiger):** It governs song, music, and exquisite dance. If malevolent stars clash, one toils in hardship; with auspicious stars, peace follows.\n\n**Mao (Rabbit):** Born of a concubine, nature is cunning yet unfulfilled. With **Mourning** and **Punishment**, kin are left solitary, and one remains poor and lowly.\n\n**Chen (Dragon):** It brings greed for wealth and grain, inviting right and wrong. If no malevolent stars break the three directions, one becomes a renowned scholar, yet severs ancestral ties.\n\n**Si (Snake):** It governs the heroic and talented, with artful literature. The **Jade Maiden** is most favorable; with **Punishment**, men and women gain official rank, and women wear the cap. Often meeting **Treasury and Wealth**, with **Purple** and auspicious stars, fortune follows.\n\n**Wu (Horse):** This palace is not noble; men are clever but fear **Celestial Yao**, with many failures and few successes. Solitary and short-lived, even auspicious stars bring only mediocrity.\n\n**Wei (Goat):** One suffers oppression, with clever schemes and a fair countenance. Ancestral foundations are ruined; with auspicious illumination, one gains a profession. Yet meeting **Longevity** and **Thigh** brings harm to parents, though poverty holds hidden fortune.\n\n**Shen (Monkey):** Fortune and emolument are both complete. Entering the **Purple Forbidden** star, glory and descendants follow; sons gain wives, wealth flourishes, and the household is warm and prosperous.\n\n**You (Rooster):** Following a woman’s whims, one strays high—men leave home, women remarry, and through dissipation, ruin comes.\n\n**Xu (Dog):** It brings harm, punishment, and short life; prison cannot be avoided. Solitary, it severs the six relations; the self remains mediocre.\n\n**Hai (Pig):** Fortune and emolument illuminate the ancestral pivot, governing the court and palace. In the **Fortune and Virtue** direction, fame spreads; meeting **Treasury, Luan, and Purple**, one attains wealth and nobility.\n\n---\n\nThe **Mao-Head Star**, also called the **Celestial Broom**, **Interloper**, or **Sweeping Comet**, is a star of ominous portent. When it guards a palace, it brings two years of disaster and famine. Wherever it shines, misfortune follows.\n\nIt also portends violent disaster and death. When in **Zi (Rat)** or **Mao (Rabbit)**, it is at its peak; when in **Wei (Goat)** or **Xu (Dog)**, it delights in **Yin (Tiger)** or the **Life Palace**, making one’s nature fierce and violent, rebellious and fond of killing, daring and strong. Wherever it shines upon a palace, misfortune follows. If encountered, the household will lack four walls. When meeting auspicious stars, one gains authority. If conjoined with malevolent stars, it brings calamity. Dwelling in this palace, one must break from ancestors, though affairs proceed swiftly. When in its temple or at peak strength, it governs military authority, surely raising banners, standards, and battle-axes. Meeting auspicious stars with nobility in its temple, one attains official emolument and illustrious glory. Conjoined with **Fortune and Virtue**, one breaks from ancestors to establish a household. Conjoined with **Seal and Longevity**, one gains glory and long life. Conjoined with **Wenchang**, one remains pure and solitary. Conjoined with **Treasury**, one is truly wealthy and prosperous. Meeting malevolent stars with **Punishment and Blade**, one harms parents, siblings, wife, and children. It also portends early death in one’s prime. Conjoined with **Punishment**, one is fond of killing; with **Void**, one suffers poverty, cold, and many disasters; with **Weeping**, one becomes a shaman, physician, or one of the nine humble trades, and dies away from home. Conjoined with **Void and Weeping**, one suffers epidemics. When **Three Stars**, **Void Star**, or malevolent stars reside in the **Life Palace** with **Mao**, it foretells a violent and early death. It also portends greed, lewdness, and lust. Meeting **Treasury**, one establishes oneself independently, often staying abroad—if a monk or Daoist, one dies in a foreign land.\n\nIn the **Official Emolument Palace**, one fears nothing, sets firm resolve, and makes decisions without doubt. In the **Migration and Fortune Palaces**, one avoids peril and hardship. When transiting or annual stars shine upon it without auspicious stars, one suffers official disasters, water calamities, and extraordinary misfortunes. For women, it is the same, portending childbirth difficulties and weakness in the lungs. If meeting auspicious stars to assist, one may gain or lose fortune through licentiousness, inviting disaster. Conjoined with **Weeping and Blade**, the six relations grow cold and distant.\n\n**Verse:**\nIn **Zi**, with intent and courage to uphold,\nBorn at night with auspicious stars, one suffers a fierce wife and many concubines.\nA concubine meeting **Celestial Fortune** gains **Purple Tenuity** and wealth.\nIn **Chou**, with **Fortune and Virtue**, misfortune turns to blessing.\nMeeting **Changing Emolument**, one achieves fame and wealth through words and writing—auspicious when in temple or at peak strength.\nIn **Yin**, one holds authority, granaries overflow, outwardly full but inwardly empty.\nMeeting auspicious stars, one is skilled and wealthy, with doubled fortune and nobility.\nIn **Mao**, one holds heavy office, a scholar of the imperial academy.\nMeeting auspicious stars, one gains wealth and nobility; conjoined with malevolent stars to clash and break, one suffers poverty.\nIn **Chen**, one abandons ancestors, harms others, invites strange misfortunes without punishment, and accomplishes nothing.\nMeeting malevolent stars, one suffers punishment and poverty.\nIn **Si**, one is fickle and inconstant, lonely and suffering, without stability, hesitating between advance and retreat, and the six relations offer no support.\nIn **Wu**, meeting auspicious stars, one gains noble patronage; conjoined with malevolent stars, one fails more than succeeds, and one’s endeavors are futile.\nIn **Wei**, one often lacks kinship ties and must leave ancestors to succeed.\nMeeting **Celestial Fortune**, **Treasury**, or **Luan**, one gains wealth; if malevolent stars clash, it is inauspicious.\nIn **Shen**, one is seductive and skilled in poisonous arts.\nMeeting malevolent stars, one suffers lifelong poverty, breaks from ancestors, and leaves home; meeting auspicious stars, one gains emolument and longevity.\nIn **You**, one breaks from ancestors and labors in worry.\nMeeting malevolent stars, one dies young and meets no good end; meeting auspicious stars, one may avoid misfortune and find good fortune.\nIn **Xu**, one breaks from ancestors but turns misfortune to good, gaining much wealth in later years.\nMeeting auspicious stars, one ascends as if by cloud ladder; meeting malevolent stars, it is inauspicious.\nIn **Hai**, one is beset by doubt, fear, and alarm.\nMeeting malevolent stars, one’s fortunes fluctuate, gains and losses are uncertain; meeting good stars, it is auspicious.\n\n---\n\nThe **Celestial Blade Star**, also called **Hanging Needle of Bloodshed**, is a star of metal, another name for the **Seven Killings** deity. In the **Purple Tenuity Enclosure**, it governs matters of yin virtue but also brings harm and injury. In structural analysis, when it resides in the **Life Palace** of men or women alongside **Blade** and **Treasury**, forming the **Zi Blade Purple Configuration**, it surely destroys the household. When in its temple in **Si (Snake)** or **Shen (Monkey)**, at peak strength in **Wu (Horse)**, or delighting in **Yin (Tiger)** or the **Life Palace**, one’s nature is cruel and wolfish, fond of killing and slaughter, often dying by the blade in battle. Wherever it shines upon a palace, it governs the authority of war and punishment. Meeting malevolent stars, one suffers injury and ruin; meeting auspicious stars, one harms others in silence but can resolve matters favorably. When in its temple and conjoined with auspicious stars, one holds military authority but cannot avoid falling in battle, suffering blood diseases, or being exiled, surely enduring flogging, humiliation, and penal servitude. Meeting auspicious stars with **Purple Tenuity**, misfortune is half reduced. Conjoined with **Treasury** or **Luan**, one has wealth but often dies by hanging, drowning, or beast-inflicted injury. Conjoined with **Seal** or **Longevity**, one may have illness but survive; otherwise, one dies young. Conjoined with **Wenchang**, one holds authority but remains solitary. Conjoined with **Luan**, one is harmed by lust. Conjoined with **Nobility**, one holds authority but meets no good end. Conjoined with **Fortune and Emolument**, one’s fortune is incomplete. Conjoined with **Punishment**, one dies violently. Conjoined with **Mao**, one dies young. Conjoined with **Yao**, one is lewd and dies young. Conjoined with **Void**, one is insubstantial and deceitful; with **Weeping**, one is solitary and harms others. For women, it portends difficult childbirth, strange postpartum illnesses, and weakness in the lungs. In the **Official Emolument Palace**, one’s nature is fierce and violent, not harming others. In the **Migration Palace**, it is inauspicious to encounter; when transiting or in annual stars, it brings sudden disasters and misfortunes—only families that accumulate goodness may avoid them. If conjoined with **Yao** and strange stars, one dies lewdly and young, establishing a separate lineage, and one’s offspring are of a different kind. Neither men nor women should have this star in their **Life Palace**.\n\n**Verse:**\nIn **Zi**, one indulges in lust, has beautiful women, suffers strange moans and toil, and wanders to the end—yet it is not entirely bad.\nIn **Chou**, one is drawn to the uncanny, fond of shamans and sorcerers, with flourishing wealth and fields.\nMeeting auspicious stars, misfortune is reduced; meeting malevolent stars, one dies by the uncanny.\nOne practices incantations, writes talismans, and is shamelessly content.\nIn **Yin**, one dies for lust; women perish from lewdness.\nMen are often foolish and dull, mere commoners, with conduct as chaotic as beasts.\nIn **Mao**, one harms the six relations, suffers from madness and illness, punishes one’s wife, and harms one’s children.\nMeeting malevolent stars, one dies young and suffers poverty; even with auspicious stars, it is often mediocre.\nIn **Chen**, one has ample celestial emolument, but in middle age, one wanders and toils.\n\nA life spent in vain busyness, with wealth and emolument uncertain in abundance.\n\nIn **Si**, wealth and emolument dissipate; one dies abroad, leaving descendants orphaned and suffering. Meeting auspicious stars may resolve this, but encountering malevolent stars brings certain harm—the blessings are faint, the misfortunes grave.\n\nIn **Wu**, one is solitary and estranged, fond of lust. In the wife’s palace, one consorts with outsiders, yet observes propriety and ritual; still, one harms and severs the six relations, with mourning imminent, visible before one’s eyes.\n\nIn **Wei**, the six relations bring harm, and affairs succeed or fail unpredictably. Meeting auspicious stars brings improvement, but if malevolent stars appear, one cannot preserve what one has—all is show without substance.\n\nIn **Shen**, evil companions bring harm, though some good may yet arise. Even with auspicious stars overhead, they cannot avert disaster. When the fortune star arrives, misfortune manifests outwardly.\n\nIn **You**, one lacks steadfast nature, and actions are often reversed. One’s temperament is unstable, bringing harm and cruel punishments.\n\nIn **Xu**, celestial misfortune and fire stars bring abundant wealth and emolument, yet one fears malevolent stars. When the limit meets evil stars, one harms and severs parents, spouse, and children, whose lives are cut short, bringing disaster and illness.\n\nIn **Hai**, harm is inevitable in the Hai palace, but emolument and position come through influential women. Those of high rank gain favor and office, their chambers and walls pure in loyalty. The celestial punishment star is called by ten names: Celestial Cannon, Fire Star, Death Talisman, Beginning Strike, Ketu, Void, Fire Virtue, Celestial Dog, Celestial Authority, and Celestial Harm. These are alternate names for Ketu, which opposes Rahu and is also called the Celestial Tail Star, governing military and penal affairs. When the Purple Tenuity faces south, it becomes the constellation of chariot and cavalry generals. Meeting it brings noble fortune, authority, and honor, with loyalty shining like the sun and integrity as unyielding as frost. It governs official disasters in structural fate, and when the execution star resides in the brothers’ palace, it forms the Broken Goose pattern. Together with Void and positioned in Mao, it is called the Sitting Thunder Gate pattern. When in its temple in Yin, flourishing in Chen, joyful in You, or in the Wu palace of the body and life palaces, it governs temperament, often redressing others’ injustices. If it illuminates this palace, it brings violent death; even with benevolent stars to mitigate, one may still face exile. If aligned with the Red Thread, flourishing in its temple, one avoids the calamity of imprisonment. In Xu, all is connected; if it loses its position, legal death is certain, and one will surely suffer from lameness, hunchback, or ailments of the waist, legs, or back. If it gains a favorable position, misfortune is lightened. When meeting auspicious stars and the Purple Tenuity in its proper place, one’s reputation and status are noble and weighty. If it loses its position, one still suffers illness, disaster, and injury. When aligned with nobility, one achieves prominence; with Literary Brilliance, one is in its temple and becomes solitary; with Treasury or Thread, one gains fame through wealth; with Seal and Longevity, one holds power; with Phoenix, one possesses civil and martial talent; with Fortune and Emolument, one is not entirely complete; with Hair, one is disfigured and fond of martial arts; with Staff, one holds authority. If in Void, one is poor and thin, yet must have a reputation, though it is more hollow than substantial. With the Strange star, one is adopted or becomes a son-in-law; with Blade, one faces exile or penal servitude; with Hair and Blade, one dies prematurely. For women, it brings harm to husbands and children, the decline of the maternal family, and the perils of childbirth and weakness. With the Yao star, one is wanton and elopes; with the Strange star, one remarries; with Phoenix, one brings fortune and emolument to her husband and receives honors; with Longevity, one enjoys a long life. If the official emolument palace meets auspicious stars, the migration palace faces dangers of water, fire, bandits, and thieves. When the flow of fortune and the year’s limit encounter it, one suffers disasters and losses.\n\nIn **Zi**, the Zi palace brings sorrow; meeting malevolent stars brings punishment and harm, poison and obstruction, short life, severed six relations, and persistent illness.\n\nIn **Chou**, the Chou palace brings much harm, greed for wealth, and ruin. Malevolent limits sever both parents, and early success leads to later ruin.\n\nIn **Yin**, the martial Yin, dwelling as the Tiger’s Might, resides in the temple of seals and emoluments. As a favored minister, one lives in ease; as a wild goose tower, one surely attains the Secretariat. If struck by malevolent stars, men harm their wives and children, while women become stern and widowed, with few children before thirty and youthful afflictions of thick blood.\n\nIn **Mao**, one suffers from waist and eye ailments, punishment, and harm, unable to find peace. Monks and Daoists may fare well, but one’s life is solitary and lonely.\n\nIn **Chen**, the Chen palace harbors a treacherous heart; when granted office, one encounters the terror of tigers and snakes. Punishment and misfortune bring injury and death—only meeting auspicious stars like the Rabbit brings relief.\n\nIn **Si**, the Si palace harms wives and children; the unyielding Luo and Gang stars bring extraordinary harm. Success and failure have no fixed time, and one is born with a hasty and rigid temperament.\n\nIn **Wu**, one dies abroad, meeting an early end, cursed by malevolent and wicked people. One harms wives and children, severs the six relations, and should blame oneself more than others.\n\nIn **Wei**, the Wei palace mixes good and ill fortune, with wives and children changing two or three times. The six relations suffer harm, one must break from ancestors, and leaving home to become a monk or Daoist may bring long life.\n\nIn **Shen**, the Shen palace brings yin poison and punishment, severing parents in early years. Without the aid of auspicious stars, disasters and dangers are anything but ordinary.\n\nIn **You**, the You palace surely brings punishment and harm; in civil or martial pursuits, one’s wives and children are doomed. In youth, one loses parents and suffers illness, meeting an early end.\n\nIn **Xu**, when pacifying the frontier in times of war, the Xu palace’s emolument star belongs to the three auspicious directions. If one’s name must be achieved alone, success comes without scheming.\n\nIn **Hai**, the Hai palace brings solitude and hollow emolument, yet literary talent severs worldly ties. Stirring heaven and moving earth, celestial emolument naturally arrives.\n\nThe Celestial Yao star is called the Celestial Debauchery and Mysterious Harlot, governing music, peach blossoms, and the collision of hairpins, a constellation of wind, flow, seduction, and absurdity. When this star resides in the palace enclosure, it specializes in lewd and filthy affairs. In structural fate, when positioned in Zi, it forms the Flower Essence Treasure King pattern, governing lewdness and chaos. Flourishing in Mao, Xu, and Chen, joyful in Hai, and in the body and life palaces, it governs a yin-poisoned temperament, chaotic and suspicious, with a fondness for beauty but shallow fortune. If in its eight temples and flourishing, one is wealthy and noble, with many servants. In Hai, it is called the Ascending Clarity Palace, possessing talent that surpasses the age.\n\nWhen encountering auspicious stars, one indulges in flowers and wine. When meeting malevolent stars, one ruins family and career, suffers punishment or death due to lust. In the Six Harmonies, one dies young. If residing in the Life Palace in decline, marriage occurs without deliberation, hand-in-hand unions form; meeting auspicious stars adds longevity, with long life; in the Treasury, wealth; in the Purple Palace, hardness and softness balance, with charm; in the Noble Palace, many delusions and concubines; in the Phoenix, lewdness; meeting inauspicious stars brings misfortune; in the Punishment Blade Palace, harm to parents and wife and children; in the Sibling Palace, disorder like crows in flight; with the Staff, fondness for beauty; near nobility, often reduced to servitude, scribes and clerks; with the Strange, ancestral lewdness and lowly solitude; with the Hair, ancestral ruin through lewdness, or heedless of others’ words; with the Weeping, cruelty and poison; in the Official Salary Palace, much emptiness and little substance, ensnaring others; in the Illness and Misfortune Palace, not to be seen, governing strange illnesses and violent harm, bodily damage from lust and wine. In fate and fortune, all are inauspicious. Residing in its temple brings fortune, with beautiful appearance and elegant bearing, charming and cunning, full of schemes, often inciting disputes, indulging in wine, lust, extravagance, and gambling—this is the foremost trait. Men under its influence are all thus. Women with the Weeping and Hair stars suffer hanging or death in childbirth.\n\n**Judgment:**\n**Zi:** The Zi Palace’s Mourning Guest governs cunning and intrigue, scheming and early death, leaving one orphaned. Women become lowly prostitutes, harming children and husbands.\n**Chou:** The Weeping star in the Chou Palace brings awe-inspiring severity, literary and martial nobility with authority. Meeting malevolent stars brings high rank; in the nine schools, medical skill excels. This star, when used in civil or military roles, makes one a prime minister or feudal lord—if not struck by malevolent stars, one becomes a master of the nine schools.\n**Yin:** The Yin Palace invites crime and punishment, imprisonment and official calamity. When inauspicious stars clash, one suffers orphanhood and poverty, unable to amass wealth. This star early harms parents, shortens life with severe illness; in the Life Palace, it is inauspicious. If aided by auspicious stars, fortune and prosperity flourish.\n**Mao:** Fierce and lustful, with auspicious stars it reverses to fortune. Wealth and salary flourish, but malevolent stars bring ruin.\n**Chen:** The Breaking Army’s fierce and robust image—if the three directions meet malevolent stars, one harms parents, lives as an illegitimate child dependent on relatives.\n**Si:** The Si Palace brings blade wounds and poison harm to life. Meeting Heavenly Fortune or Heavenly Staff reduces harm by half; women become widows. Meeting the Red Phoenix, one is harmed by lust and dies in a foreign land.\n**Wu:** Literary talent with a reputation, meeting opportunity brings noble rank, official prominence, and fine robes. Inauspicious turns auspicious; the Star of the Hanging Net governs shamans, physicians, monks, and Daoists.\n**Wei:** Governs charm, blood illness, and death; if the Official Salary Palace aids, one still dies young. Meeting the Red Phoenix star reduces harm by half.\n**Shen:** Defies norms, disrupts family order, first ruins then rebuilds. Meeting malevolence brings severe illness, death, and loss of literary grace.\n**You:** One’s name is recorded in history, salary and rank rise high. The You Palace’s Arrow Star brings harm from blades and arrows. With malevolent stars, punishment harms the six relations, causing parental death, ruin, orphanhood, and family decline.\n**Xu:** Loses position through ferocity; malevolent stars bring official calamity and violence. This palace governs orphanhood, poverty, and misfortune, with evil befalling the body.\n**Hai:** The Hai Palace in yin evil dissipates family wealth. Malevolent stars bring official calamity and many deaths in childbirth. If malevolent stars strike, men suffer official misfortune; women endure difficult births. The star’s transit through fate determines fortune or misfortune.\n\nWhen the Purple Tenuity star guards fate, it brings honor, promotion, and joyous events; commoners’ enterprises prosper, scholars gain reputation, nobles advance in rank, monks and Daoists enjoy pure blessings, and women strengthen their husbands’ families. The three directions of Hai and Mao meeting auspicious stars bring imperial audience and honor; commoners rise in the world.\n\n**Heavenly Void:**\nThe Heavenly Void is named for emptiness; when its star guards fate, it brings hollow fame, financial loss, and peril, with sudden wealth elusive. There are false alarms, empty joys, mourning for women and children, funerary clothes, and financial ruin. When Punishment, Weeping, Yao, and Blade stars converge, one suffers from swelling and poisoning. Void meeting Punishment and Killing stars in fate brings hidden family misfortune, long-term official restraint, and inauspiciousness in all matters, leading to consumptive weakness. It also governs poverty, orphanhood, and suffering, with life’s good things turning to nothing, all affairs ending in vain—like a dream.\n\n**Heavenly Nobility:**\nWhen the Heavenly Nobility star guards fate, joy is extraordinary, disasters vanish, and fortune prevails. Scholars pass imperial examinations, officials and nobles ascend in rank, commoners prosper in wealth, and monks and Daoists see their robes and alms bowls filled. Women who encounter this star will bring honor to their husbands and amass riches, even receiving titles.\n*Verse:*\nThe Noble star enters fate with boundless joy,\nThough trials may come, all turns to good.\nScholars who meet it shall pass the exams,\nOfficials and nobles ascend the court’s hall.\n\n**Heavenly Seal:**\nWhen the Heavenly Seal star guards fate, nobles swiftly rise to prominence, while commoners establish thriving enterprises. Those of high rank wield the power of three seals, holding life and death in their grasp. If positioned in a flourishing and exalted palace, they command armies and govern the people, wielding military authority. Even ordinary folk who encounter nobility, or monks and Daoists, attain esteemed positions. If not in a dominant configuration but residing in a weak or afflicted palace, they still gain wealth through proximity to the powerful.\n*Verse:*\nWhen fate aligns with the Heavenly Seal,\nPromotions and honors swiftly reveal.\nOne office holds seals in layered might,\nHigh rank and fame shine ever bright.\n\n**Heavenly Longevity:**\nWhen the Heavenly Longevity star guards fate, all affairs turn auspicious. Meeting further auspicious stars brings glory, prosperity, and enduring longevity, with disasters dissolved. If the Four Breaks are unopposed, abundant blessings follow.\n*Red Phoenix:*\nWhen the Red Phoenix star guards fate, it brings fortune in wealth and rank. Men gain beautiful wives, and women wed worthy husbands. If it meets Wealth and Nobility stars, glory and prosperity abound. If not in its proper palace and further afflicted by celestial anomalies, it brings public and private losses, mourning, unrest, theft, and unexpected calamities.\n\n**Heavenly Treasury:**\nWhen the Heavenly Treasury star guards fate, it brings wealth. If positioned in a flourishing palace, families swiftly grow rich, businesses thrive, and even commoners prosper. Without afflicting stars, those who have long prospered become the era’s Marches of Chen, their fortunes so vast they anchor entire districts, their names synonymous with sudden wealth.\n*Verse:*\nWithin the Heavenly Treasury’s domain,\nA decade’s wealth flows without strain.\nIf outer stars align in grace,\nOne stands before the royal place.\n\n**Linked Chain:**\nWhen the Linked Chain star guards fate, it brings advancement in wealth and rank. If in the Life Palace, flourishing and meeting the Earthly Lord or Heavenly Treasury, it brings windfall gains. Meeting the Red Phoenix, it brings prosperous fortune and encounters with noble patrons. Triadic alignment with auspicious stars also brings blessings. If triadic alignment involves Literary and Punishment stars, it brings legal disputes and misfortune. If met by auspicious stars, one is released by imperial pardon. If afflicted by malevolent stars, it brings separation, death, lawsuits, family ruin, financial loss, theft, fire, and the scattering of wealth across the four directions, ensnaring resources from all six realms.\n*Verse:*\nThe Linked Chain star governs wealth alone,\nWith auspicious stars, fortune is shown.\nWhen fate and years align just right,\nTreasuries open in full sight.\n*Another Verse:*\nThe Linked Wealth star, a gem so rare,\nBorn with coffers rich and fair.\nWhen fate and years in union meet,\nWealth fills the gates with joy complete.\n\n**Literary Brilliance:**\nWhen the Literary Brilliance, the Heavenly Fortune star, guards fate, nobles gain imperial audience, officials expand their posts, and commoners acquire fields and estates, their halls radiant and homes renewed. When fate reaches the Hai-Mao-Wei palace, sudden wealth and prosperity arise; monks and Daoists attain purity, while ordinary folk rise swiftly. Women who encounter this star enjoy harmonious husbands and fine children, their silkworms and granaries flourishing. Meeting Nobility and Wealth stars brings titles and honors.\n*Verse:*\n\n**Literary Brilliance (Wenchang):**\nThe auspicious star known as Literary Brilliance shines—\nScholars and officials meet it to see their names ascend.\nCommoners who encounter it expand their lands and halls,\nWhile women, monks, and Daoists find it brings good fortune’s call.\n\n**Heavenly Fortune (Tianfu):**\nWhen the Heavenly Fortune star guards fate,\nNobles gain imperial audience, officials rise in state.\nCommoners acquire new fields and homes,\nTheir gates auspicious, their fortunes bright as domes.\nThe virtuous see promotions, double joys, and wealth untold,\nWith blessings and prosperity in streams of green and gold.\nKings and nobles, common folk, monks and Daoists too,\nAll find their fortunes swelling, their blessings ever new.\nWomen who meet this star enjoy both fortune and long life,\nSupporting husbands, nurturing children, free from strife.\n\n*Verse:*\nWhen fate aligns with Heavenly Fortune’s grace,\nThe household thrives, its fortunes interlace.\nWealth flows in, new lives begin,\nFields and homes expand—blessings enter in.\n\n**Heavenly Emolument (Tianlu):**\nWhen Heavenly Emolument shines upon one’s fate,\nOld wishes and new schemes all meet success of late.\nExiles and prisoners soon find reprieve,\nWhile officials receive promotions they long to achieve.\nMerchants uncover hidden paths to gain,\nAnd scholars and warriors wield dual domains of reign.\nAll who encounter this star rejoice and celebrate,\nFor ventures succeed beyond their former state.\n\n*Verse:*\nWithin the Heavenly Emolument’s embrace,\nDesires for office meet with fortune’s grace.\nWith Red Phoenix in flow and years aligned,\nA decade’s rise leaves peers far behind.\n\n**Heavenly Rod (Tianzhang):**\nWhen the Heavenly Rod star guards fate,\nIllnesses arise—consumption, wheezing, foot and heart’s weight,\nChills and fevers, vomiting, falls, and blows,\nOfficial troubles, disquiet, and woes.\nMourning robes, disputes, and strife may follow,\nOr confinement in chains, a life hollow.\nIf the Execution Blade aligns near,\nSudden calamity brings death or fear.\nElse, wind-stroke or cold may strike with force,\nLeaving breath labored, the body’s course.\nIf in the Palace of Sickness it resides,\nStrange ailments afflict, and suffering abides.\nAll it touches brings harm, not gain,\nWith sores, pus, and blood, and endless pain.\n\n**Heavenly Anomaly (Tianyi):**\nWhen the Heavenly Anomaly star guards fate,\nEstates disperse, mourning robes accumulate.\nGreat and small face punishment’s sting,\nWith strange disasters beneath the home’s eaves clinging.\nIf joined by Heavenly Maiden, expect moves and loss,\nLawsuits, debts, and disputes—no gain, only cost.\nWith malevolent stars, life may end,\nOr official ruin descend.\nIf in its temple it resides,\nMisfortune lingers, woes abide.\nBut if three auspicious stars align,\nIts harm is checked, its sting benign.\n\n**Hairy Head (Maotou):**\nWhen Hairy Head shines upon one’s fate,\nIllness, punishment, and moves await,\nWith fires, floods, and theft to mar the way,\nAnd restless nights that never stay.\nIf Void and Wailing stars converge,\nPlagues, sores, and burns may surge—\nFire’s wrath or scalding water’s sting,\nOr wounds from blades that death may bring.\nIf Execution stars align in force,\nFew blessings come, but ruin’s course.\nMourning robes and deaths may follow near,\nWith losses vast and woes severe.\nYet if in its temple it stands tall,\nWith kind stars joining, fortunes call—\nNobility, campaigns, or blades of war,\nOr civil ranks to rise once more.\nIf not in temple, strength, or height,\nDisaster strikes with all its might.\nBut if three auspicious stars appear,\nIts harm is checked, its threats disappear.\n\n*Verse:*\nThe Comet’s Hairy Head brings woe untold,\nWith plagues and sickness, bodies weak and cold.\nIf year on year its shadow looms,\nSeek prayers and rites to dispel the gloom.\n\n**Heavenly Punishment (Tianxing):**\nWhen Heavenly Punishment guards fate,\nUnforeseen official disasters await,\nWith legal troubles, losses dire,\nAnd water’s perils, drowning’s ire.\nParents may suffer, siblings part,\nWith broken bonds and heavy heart.\nIf Maiden or Anomaly align,\nEyes and ears grow dim with pain,\nOr bloodshed’s curse may mark the way.\nWith Wailing stars, fear holds sway—\nIllness, terror, partings grim,\nWith wealth and kin lost on a whim.\nIf Heavenly Rod joins near,\nOfficial woes bring grief severe.\nWith malevolent stars in force,\nThe body bends, its course perverse—\nHunched backs, twisted limbs, and pain,\nOr organs failing, breath in vain.\nIf kind stars share its place,\nEvil turns to blessings’ grace.\nBut with Execution, Wailing, Void,\nLife’s thread is cut, fate destroyed.\n\n**Heavenly Blade (Tianren):**\nWhen Heavenly Blade shines bright,\nDisaster strikes, wealth takes flight.\nParents and spouse and children too\nMay face misfortune’s bitter dew.\nIllness, punishment, and wounds appear,\nWith sores, blood, and strange afflictions near.\nWomen face childbirth’s cruel test,\nWith abscesses and poisons manifest.\nStay still, avoid ambition’s call,\nLest harm befall and fortunes fall.\nFamilies may see members lost,\nWith mourning robes and lives exhaust.\nIf directly or opposingly it glows,\nMisfortune follows where it goes.\nWith Execution stars aligned,\nCalamity leaves none behind.\nIf in the year’s fate it combines,\nWith malevolent stars in dark designs,\nSeven of eight in a household may fall,\nIts truth as certain as fate’s call.\n\n**Heavenly Maiden (Tianyao):**\nWhen Heavenly Maiden shines upon one’s fate,\nWater’s perils bring ruin and weight.\nIf joined by Anomaly, expect strife—\nLost wealth, strange woes, and women’s knife,\nWith entanglements and slander’s sting,\nAnd troubles that no peace may bring.\nIf in its temple it resides,\nEvil turns to blessings’ tides.\nBut with malevolent stars aligned,\nLife’s thread is cut, fate maligned.\n\n*Verse:*\nWhen Heavenly Maiden meets your fate,\nWith Red Phoenix in years of late,\nUnbidden, joy with women flows,\nWith shared delight in all that grows.\n\n**Heavenly Wailing (Tianku):**\nWhen Heavenly Wailing shines upon one’s fate,\nAnd malevolent stars align in hate,\nNo escape from fate’s decree remains.\nIf three directions join its chains,\nExile awaits beyond the door;\nWith mourning robes, death comes for sure.\nIf three oppose, the waves will rise;\nIn life’s palace, the Yellow Springs lies.\nIf three directions guard one’s fate,\nThe waves of woe will seal one’s state.\n\n*Verse:*\nWaves and tides through ten years’ span,\nEven nobles dare not meet this ban.\nDirect or slant, its gaze brings dread,\nWith punishment, life’s thread is shed.\nThis star’s direct or slanting light\nBrings peril, woe, and endless night.\nWith Wailing and Void in dark array,\nPlagues, punishment, and death hold sway.\nIf Execution and Blade align,\nLife’s end is swift, fate’s design.\nWith Wailing, Anomaly, Maiden near,\nMoves, losses, lawsuits bring despair.\nIf Wailing, Anomaly, Maiden meet,\nLost wealth and sudden woes repeat.\n\nThe gravest cases bring only misfortune and calamity.\n\n*End of Scroll Three of Purple Star Astrology*\n\n*[Note: 占 originally

Difficult for the six relations, clothing and emolument insufficient, brothers without affection.\n\n**Celestial Link**\n- *Zi* hour, middle four *ke*: No clashes or breaks.\n  Actions rise and fall, later years content. Fate attracts livestock and fields, brothers without affection, a life with little support.\n\n- *Zi* hour, last four *ke*: First harms the father.\n  Brothers unreliable, children late in coming, a life of toil. Actions have beginnings but no ends; only suitable for leaving the ancestral home. A life with no support from the six relations.\n\n**Red Phoenix Palace**\n- *Chou* hour, first four *ke*: No clashes or breaks.\n  Clothing and emolument sufficient, ancestral property acquired. Proficient in civil and martial arts, close to the noble. Children may suffer misfortune; few harmonious relations with brothers and the six relations. A life of estrangement and coldness.\n\n- *Chou* hour, middle four *ke*: First harms the father.\n  Clothing and food insufficient, ancestral property hard to acquire. Success comes late; a person without strength, prone to sorrow and resentment, fond of stirring trouble. Kind-hearted but blunt, unable to conceal matters. Brothers and the six relations like ice and charcoal, self-reliant and independent. Later years auspicious, but children difficult to raise; better late than never.\n\n- *Chou* hour, last four *ke*: First harms the mother.\n  The six relations offer little support, brothers also without affection. Kind-hearted and upright, clothing and emolument near the noble. Skilled in arts, a life with few children.\n\n**Celestial Void Star**\n- *Yin* hour, first four *ke*: First harms the father.\n  Little support from the six relations, early years toilsome. Self-reliant, clothing and food insufficient, much worry. Later years bring prosperity, ancestral property rarely acquired.\n\n- *Yin* hour, middle four *ke*: No clashes or breaks.\n  A person with success and failure, wielding authority. Clothing and emolument sufficient, wealthy and noble. Temperament hasty, light, loyal, and upright. Little support from the six relations, brothers somewhat affectionate but distant. Few children, a life of peach blossoms and bamboo.\n\n- *Yin* hour, last four *ke*: First harms the mother.\n  Little support from the six relations, a monastic or Daoist life. A toilsome body; if leaving the ancestral home, the heart is never content. Little support from brothers, children late in coming. A life of rising fortune in middle and later years.\n\n**Celestial Longevity Palace**\n- *Mao* hour, first four *ke*: First harms the father.\n  Brothers somewhat without affection, the six relations indifferent. Early years wandering, ancestral property rising and falling. Actions rise and fall, children initially lacking but later substantial.",

      "translated_text": "One account of baleful limits states: if the Celestial Blade star is absent, and the limit reaches a palace where it is enshrined or at peak power, a family member will surely shed tears. The same holds when Celestial Void arrives at its limit. Celestial Staff, regardless of whether it resides in a temple or radiant palace, also brings mourning garb. Should the Celestial Wanderer or Weeping Star ascend to the throne, death may likewise be predicted.\n\nAn ancient verse says:\nA guest arrives, and zither and books are set aside;\nEven a child might sketch this scene.\nWhen power and influence are forgotten, righteousness weighs heavy;\nGolden bonds of friendship are forged in shared purpose.\nAmid osmanthus fragrance, the scholar toils;\nBefore the jeweled-tree hall, the traveler’s carriage halts.\nNow Guan and Liu are met again,\nTheir names fragrant for a thousand years, spread through the countryside.\n\nYet when carbuncles and ulcers fester and burst, the great fate follows—meeting with overturned wheels, yet still lost in confusion.\n\nThe Nine Yang Stars determine the weight of fortune and misfortune:\nPurple Wood, Literary Wood, Fortune Earth, Emolument Wood, Seal Earth, Longevity Earth, Staff Wood, Treasury Earth, and Yao Wood.\nWhen in yang palaces, fortune is heavy and calamity light;\nWhen in yin palaces, fortune is light and calamity heavy.\n\nThe Nine Yin Stars likewise divide the weight of misfortune and fortune:\nNoble Earth, Crimson Metal, Strange Earth, Hair Water, Void Water, Thread Earth, Punishment Fire, Blade Metal, and Weeping Metal.\nWhen in yin palaces, fortune is heavy and calamity light;\nWhen in yang palaces, calamity is heavy and fortune light.\nHow could one not examine this with care?\nYet if they reside in temples or flourish in prosperous palaces, one need not be bound by yin and yang.\n\nThe Three Terraces Entering the Seat\nThese two stars are the *qi* of the Purple Spirit, wielding the authority of the Northern Dipper. They govern the pure and noble constellations of celestial mechanisms, presiding over literary success, official advancement, and auspicious blessings. When one’s fate aligns with solitary numbers, they become the deities of Left Auxiliary and Right Assistant, known as the Three Harmonies and Eight Seats.\n\nIf they illuminate the Wife Palace, it portends separation or harm; the same applies to the Heavenly Palace. When these two stars shine upon a person’s life or fate, or upon the limit, it is most auspicious—a sign of great nobility and unimpeded success.\n\nFor the Three Terraces star:\nFor men and women, begin at the *xu* (11th) position, count forward from the first month to the month of birth, then count from one to the day of birth.\n\nFor the Eight Seats star:\nFor men and women, begin at the *chen* (5th) position, count forward from the first month to the month of birth, then count from one to the day of birth.\n\nDragon Pond and Phoenix Pavilion\nThese two stars are the celestial overseers of literary brilliance, remnants of the Metal Star, governing literary honors and scholarly success. When present in a person’s fate, they bestow refinement, cleverness, elegance, and gentle goodness. For men and women alike, they bring the chance to ride dragons and attach to phoenixes, achieving illustrious rank, abundant wealth, and ample emolument. For women, they confer exceptional beauty, versatile talents, and a heart unmoved by wanton desires. If in a weak palace, their influence is slight; if in a strong palace, their fortune is profound.\n\nFor Dragon Pond:\nFor men and women, begin at the *chen* (5th) position, count forward from the *zi* (1st) hour to the hour of birth.\n\nFor Phoenix Pavilion:\nFor men and women, begin at the *xu* (11th) position, count backward from the *zi* (1st) hour to the hour of birth.\n\nThese eighteen stars have their own configurations, and beyond them lie greater patterns, now selected as follows:\n\nIf a person’s Life and Destiny Palaces reside in *hai* (12th) or *zi* (1st), and the stars do not enter their temples, it is called the \"Body Drowned in Rivers and Lakes\" pattern.\nFor men and women in *xu* (11th), *hai* (12th), *chen* (5th), or *si* (6th), it is called the \"Child’s Head Enmeshed in a Net\" pattern.\nIf the Life Palace is in *si* (6th), it is called the \"Body Entering the Poor Folk\" pattern, portending the loss of a spouse.\nIf the Destiny rests upon the Blade, it is called the \"Grinding Candle as Destiny\" pattern, marked by frequent success and failure.\nWhen Celestial Blade and Celestial Void reside in *mao* (4th), it is called the \"Destiny Seated at the Gate of Wealth\" pattern.\nAs for baleful influences that do not prove baleful, there are always auspicious matters to mitigate them.\n\nIf a person is born in the *mao* (4th) hour with their Destiny seated in the *mao* (4th) palace, it is called \"Serpent Entering the Dragon’s Palace\"—regardless of the time, all born with their Destiny in *mao* (4th) are auspicious.\n\nThe Seven Strong Palaces\nWhen auspicious stars descend and reside, the Fortune Palace becomes a palace of blessing. The fields and dwellings, wife and concubines, and official emolument palaces are of the highest strength; for men and women, the Virtue Palace is next in strength, followed by the Talent and Wealth Palace as nearly strong.\n\nThe Five Strong Palaces\nAppearance and servants are of ill weakness; if further debilitated, the Brothers Palace is half-debased, also called the \"Idle Palace.\" Illness and misfortune, migration and movement are of secondary weakness; baleful stars residing in temples are considered extraordinary.\n\nThe Nine Auspicious Stars Entering Temples (Example)\nPurple, Literary, Crimson, Noble, Fortune, Green, Seal, Longevity, and Treasury—if just three to five of these shine upon a strong palace, they bestow honor and nobility.\nLiterary Brilliance and Celestial Nobility govern scholarly fame and literary distinction, mastery of classics and canons.\nCelestial Punishment delighting in the Heavenly Treasury, residing in the Life Palace and illuminating the body, along with four strong palaces, must indicate a person of true talent and solid virtue, one who rises above the crowd.\n\nThe Nine Baleful Stars Entering Temples (Example)\nPunishment, Strange, Blade, Staff, Void, Weeping, Hair, and Yao.\nWhen baleful stars reside in temples and flourish, illuminating the body and fate, they bring fortune. If they do not reside in temples or flourish, they bring misfortune.\nCelestial Punishment residing in a temple transforms into a star of literary elegance, governing talent and learning.\nCelestial Blade entering a temple governs the accumulation of grain and may also govern avarice, vanity, and the depletion of talent and wealth. One’s fate and limit should not encounter Punishment and Blade.\nWhen Void and Weeping illuminate the Life and Destiny Palaces, they harm the wives and concubines of men and women. If they enter temples and flourish, scholars may die before their time.\nHair Head and Void Depletion are taboo when illuminating the Talent and Wealth or Wife and Concubines Palaces, as they bring harm to wives and great loss of talent and wealth. When baleful stars bring misfortune, one must weigh whether the baleful outweighs the auspicious.\n\nLimit Verse for Refined Judgment\nHeaven hangs its images, earth forms its shapes;\nWho can fathom the rise and fall of human affairs?\nFirst examine the limits for passage or blockage,\nThen observe the stars for withering or flourishing.\nThe Life Palace and Official Emolument are strongest;\nFor men and women, migration and harmony align with the Three Harmonies.\nParents should be exalted, flanked by wives and concubines;\nNearly strong are wealth and talent, illness and fortune.\n\nHexagram Statement\nThe Three Palaces of Brothers are called \"Idle Extremes\";\nIll weakness must still be borne by servants.",

      "translated_text": "A person is endowed with the qi of Heaven and Earth, receiving the essence of yin and yang to give rise to their body and fate. Above, they belong to the Five Stars; below, to the Five Phases. If the timing is correct, their body and fate will be exalted, and their future bright and prosperous. If the timing is incorrect, their fate will be base and their body lowly, sinking into obscurity and drift.\n\nGenerally, one’s life must find the stars in their proper positions, with favorable fortune and strength aligning to bring success. Moreover, if one delights in prosperity without affliction, and auspicious stars reside in strong palaces, they are a person of profound fortune. This is predestined, governed by the stars.\n\nIn examining fate, first determine the Body Palace, for the body is linked above to the spirit of Tai Yi. If beneficent stars meet with prosperous fortune in their proper positions, forming celestial harmony, this is a life of purity and nobility. Only then should one assess the Fate Palace and the hour, for if these are shallow or unstable, they lack strength. Even with powerful stars, their blessings will be slight. Only when timing is correct and positions proper can one attain glory, virtue, fields and dwellings, official rank, and emolument.\n\nThe six palaces’ good and ill determine survival and demise; nobility and baseness fix fortune and misfortune, yielding accurate predictions. Whenever stars reside in palaces of honor or places of joy and prosperity, one must also consider the yin and yang divisions of the palaces. As the classic states: “Yang stars favor goodness; yin stars favor destruction.”\n\nIn the two palaces of stars and fate, when the division of hours and quarters yields more yang than yin—such as being born in the first, second, third, or fourth quarter of the hour—one’s fortune will be abundant, life long, parents blessed, siblings harmonious, wife virtuous, and children outstanding. If one’s body and fate further reside in palaces of honor and prosperity, this is a life of the highest rank.\n\nMen born under yang stars are noble births. Those born in the first four quarters will be resolute and blessed. Women born under yin stars are honorable births. Those born from the fifth to the eighth quarter will excel in wifely virtue, enjoy support from maternal kin, harmony with sisters-in-law, a marriage of mutual respect, and children who are both talented and numerous.\n\nOne must calculate the hour precisely to gauge fortune and misfortune, determine the harmony of flesh and bone, discern the presence of affliction or conflict, and distinguish between wealth and poverty, wisdom and folly.\n\nYang stars govern civil matters and thrive in their palaces of honor and prosperity. Occupying the six yang palaces, they produce scholars of refined literary grace. Yin stars govern martial matters and flourish in places of joy and prosperity. Occupying the six yin domains, they produce warriors of courage and resolve.\n\nWhenever stars reside in yang within yang or in yin within yin, each following its kind, this is called “finding its proper position.” The opposite—yin and yang intermingled—is called “not finding its proper position.” The qi one receives may be turbid: within a single day, from *mao* to *shen* (5 a.m. to 5 p.m.) are the six yang hours of daylight; from *you* to *yin* (5 p.m. to 5 a.m.) are the six yin hours of night.\n\nThose born in yin palaces should avoid daytime births; those born in yang palaces should avoid nighttime births. Both positions are unfavorable at the same hour. Further, births occurring at the cusp of day and night, or when the hour straddles upper and lower quarters, require careful assessment of fortune and lifespan. If yin and yang are mixed, the quarters uneven, and the pairing inauspicious, this—beyond mere honor or prosperity—portends a life of meager fortune and short span.\n\nMoreover, one must observe the transiting limits where beneficent or malefic stars enter the moments of body and fate, for this precisely determines fortune and misfortune, all of which will be verified.\n\n**The Three Divisions of Flesh and Bone: A Rhymed Exposition**\nOf old, the profound principle was called the Purple Forbidden, uniquely holding the wonders of a single school. It became the marvel of the Three Divisions, exploring the roots of stars’ good and ill, thoroughly seeking the inner mysteries, and fixing the noble and base positions of the palaces. By careful examination, survival and demise are discerned.\n\nWhen the Supreme Ultimate first divided, the Three Powers were complete. Yet why do some grow poor and die young? Why do others grow rich and live long? The reasons lie in fate’s rise and fall, in the purity or impurity of one’s nature, and in the alternation of calamity and fortune.\n\nTracing back to ancient texts, blessings and emoluments shine together in the Purple Forbidden’s position. All stars’ conditions, hours, and quarters are detailed below.\n\n*Mao* transmission belongs to yang:\nPurple Wood, Literary Wood, Fortune Earth, Emolument Wood, Seal Earth, Longevity Earth, Staff Wood, Storehouse Earth, Yao Water, Noble Earth, Crimson Metal, Strangeness Earth, Hair Water, Emptiness Water, Noble Earth, Punishment Fire, Blade Metal, Wailing Metal.\n\n*Chen* hour, yang:\nLiterary, Fortune, Auspiciousness, Seal, Longevity, Staff, Storehouse.",

      "translated_text": "**Hour of *Shen* (Yang):**\nLiterary, Fortune, Emolument, Seal, Longevity, Staff, Storehouse,\n**Yao**, **Zi**, **Hong**, **Yi**, **Mao**, **Xu**, **Guan**,\nPunishment, Blade, Wailing, **Noble**\n\nFortune, Emolument, Seal, Longevity, Staff, Storehouse, **Yao**,\n**Zi**, Literary, **Yi**, **Mao**, **Xu**, **Guan**-Punishment,\nBlade, Punishment, **Noble**, **Hong**\n\n**Mid-Chart Noble Destiny:**\nWhen auspicious stars stand high and inauspicious stars lie low, with the life and destiny palaces graced by propitious constellations—**Wenchang** in attendance, auxiliary and seal stars arrayed in the four directions or forming a triple conjunction with fortune-bringing stars, stationed in their proper or exalted palaces—then the auxiliary and seal stars govern eight *ke* of the proper hour, while the nine luminaries occupy positions of strength. If the fortune star resides in its exalted palace, harmoniously aspecting the opposite palace, and the auxiliary star alone stands high over the life and destiny palaces, even a single star in its proper or exalted position shines brightly in a position of strength. Alternatively, if within the three-day palace and the eight *ke*, one occupies the domain of the six yin palaces, with the **Luan** star unaspected by the **Celestial Staff**, the mother enjoys long life, and if further exalted, this denotes a mid-chart noble destiny, a life of wealth and prominence.\n\n**Lower-Chart Noble Destiny:**\nWhen the **Taifu** star alone stands high over the life and destiny palaces, and the three-day palace is fully aspected by three auspicious stars in triple conjunction, this constitutes a lower-chart noble destiny. If the fortune star is exalted and strong while auspicious stars are weak and debilitated, it signifies a lesser noble destiny. Such is the interplay of yin and yang, the harmony of time and moment.\n\n**Common Destiny Outside the Chart:**\nWhen auspicious and inauspicious stars jointly aspect the life palace, and the **Taifu** star is not in its proper position, this denotes the destiny of a wealthy commoner. If the **Taifu** star is weak and debilitated, yet **Hongluan** aspects directly without affliction, and the **Red Luan** forms a harmonious aspect, this signifies a person of immense wealth.\n\n**Destitute and Lowly Destiny:**\nWhen the fortune star is debilitated in **Tianyao**, aspecting both the life and destiny palaces, with the **Xu** star in opposition, this marks the most destitute and lowly destiny—parents lost in early years, siblings few or nonexistent, wives and children harmed. Even if one encounters a favorable period with auspicious stars, wealth does not accumulate, for the root is shallow and weak. Though one may possess literary talent and official emolument, this does not constitute a destiny within the chart.\n\n**Foolish Destiny:**\nThe **Wenchang** star must not be debilitated, for the six auspicious stars, when in positions of strength, become inauspicious. If they do not reside in their proper palaces, how much more dire the misfortune? Generally, when stars enter the chart, one need not consider official emolument. For scholars, one must examine **Wenchang**; for commoners, one may simply observe **Tianlu** and **Tianzhang** to determine the measure of longevity and prosperity.\n\n**Determining the Aspects of Palace Conjunctions:**\nWhen fortune and longevity jointly aspect **Hongluan**, how can one not be intelligent? When **Xu** and **Yi** together attend **Maotou**, how can one not be dull-witted? If positioned in **Tianyin**, it governs migration and authority; if in **Wenchang**, it lacks the conduct of fortune and emolument. In the **Fields and Estates** palace, granaries overflow with grain; in the **Wealth and Silk** palace, coffers brim with gold and jade. When **Noble Emolument** aspects the **Children** palace, descendants bring glory; when **Storehouse** and **Guan** aspect the **Life and Destiny** palace, one’s future is ever secure, and honor flourishes. If **Yao** and **Yi** entangle the body, longevity is denied; if **Blade** and **Wailing** afflict destiny, **Tianxu** and **Tianren** bring only calamity. **Tianxing** and **Tianzhang**—who could find joy in their presence? When they meet wives and concubines, widowhood is often auspicious; when they enter the **Official Emolument** palace, poverty and illness abound. To encounter these stars in one’s fate is to face imminent peril; to pass beyond their influence is to escape disaster. Thus, destiny knows prosperity and adversity, but not permanence. The successful occupy positions of strength, while the struggling dwell in desolation. Honor, prosperity, and longevity arise from the conjunction of auspicious stars; violence, misfortune, and early death stem from the convergence of inauspicious ones. Without the stars, how could one examine the details? Without fate, how could one know the essentials? With keen focus and deep reflection, one may unlock the mysteries of this text. By discussing the present and exploring the past, one comes to recognize the excellence of this work.\n\n**Life and Death, Poverty and Wealth:**\nIf not predestined, how could one know? **Nobility and lowliness, prosperity and decay**—these are not matters of chance. The art of divination is both precise and subtle. By studying the classics, one may revisit them thrice and come to understand. To grasp this profound art requires more than a single day. The teachings of the **Four Lords and Three Origins** are as unchanging as true gold; the discourse on the **Five Stars and Six Luminaries** is as invaluable as fine jade. By silently observing the principles of the **Eighteen Stars** and mastering the essentials of the **Twelve Palaces**, one may discern poverty and wealth, nobility and lowliness—none can escape the scrutiny of the fortune stars.\n\n**Man receives the qi of Heaven and Earth, forming the Three Powers.**\nThose complete in Heaven, Earth, and Man are called *cheng ren* (perfected persons), and when their fate aligns with prosperity, their wealth endures without limit. Those incomplete in Heaven, Earth, and Man are called *bu cheng ren* (imperfect persons), and when their fate arrives, their wealth collapses without recourse. Generally, those unaspected by **Xu**, **Wailing**, **Punishment**, or **Blade** are complete; those afflicted by them are incomplete. When fate enters a yang palace and encounters a yang star, or enters a yin palace and encounters a yin star, each receives the harmony of Heaven’s timing. To meet the **Wailing** star in a year of avoidance is to see immediate consequences.\n\n**At birth, if the Zi and Hong noble stars reside in the life and destiny palaces,**\nthe early years bring honor and nobility, with emolument flourishing and expanding. If **Wenchang** and other stars aspect directly or reside in their proper or exalted palaces, auspicious events and joy follow. When **Tianxu** enters one’s fate, wealth and silk dissipate; wherever it aspects, misfortune and strangeness arise. When **Tianyin** enters one’s fate and occupies a position of strength in its proper palace, it brings the joy of wealth and authority. Even if not within the chart, it heralds auspicious events. To encounter **Hongluan** in one’s fate is to wed a woman of beauty or for a woman to marry a man of talent. When the **Xu** star aspects one’s fate, it brings false alarms. **Yao** and **Blade** govern water disasters; **Mao** and **Yi** govern fire calamities, exile, or forced name changes. If one’s fate encounters **Storehouse** and **Guan**, it brings sudden wealth, lifting the poor to riches. For the rest, inauspicious stars follow the guidance of the **Wenchang** star—examining the stars’ positions in their palaces provides the standard, without the slightest error.",

      "translated_text": "Should there be those who die at the very onset of a fate-period, or perish as it draws near, one must rely on the stars of life and death for precise judgment. If the **Tianku** star shines directly upon one’s fate and destiny, it is called the **Yellow Springs star**. If it shines directly upon the fate-period while also opposing it, this is termed the **Raging Waves fate-period**, presaging death and layer upon layer of mourning. In yang palaces, it brings much sorrow; in yin palaces, it may bring some joy. Even if it resides in its proper temple as a fortune star, one cannot escape external bereavement or the wearing of mourning for kin.\n\nThe **Raging Waves fate-period**, in another account, is said to be the **Staff, Cangue, and Wailing**—these three stars. The judgment states:\n\n*Gain and loss, poverty and prosperity are not easily fathomed,*\n*For all depend upon the palace of fate and destiny.*\n*When auspicious stars descend here, blessings abound;*\n*When baleful stars align, one meets a grim end.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*When both **Yao** and **Yi** stars shine upon one’s fate,*\n*This baleful pair portends inevitable misfortune.*\n*Breaking from one’s roots and leaving home, given to wine and lust,*\n*The man becomes a lecher, the woman a harlot.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*The **Tianku** star is most inauspicious;*\n*If it appears at the great fate-period, danger and death follow.*\n*Say not that ancestral estates will be worn away—*\n*Fear rather that one’s span of years will not be long.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*When the **Xu** and **Blade** stars aspect one’s fate,*\n*Only in forests and wilds may one find peace.*\n*For the common man who offends them, a thousand leagues of travel*\n*Will bring disaster upon disaster, one after another.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*When baleful stars afflict one amid illness,*\n*The five viscera fall into disorder, beyond boasting.*\n*Crooked back, hunched waist, and bent spine—*\n*Even if one’s years are long, fortune will not be kind.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*Of the four cardinal palaces, strength is most vital;*\n*When beneficent stars shine upon them, joy is extraordinary.*\n*But if the **Wailing** and **Blade** stars stand overhead,*\n*Bone and flesh suffer harm, and mourning knows no end.*\n*In fields and dwellings, ancestral estates are broken;*\n*For wives and concubines, injury is certain.*\n*In office and emolument, matters arise without cause;*\n*In the palace of fate, discord and strangeness prevail.*\n*From beginning to end, fortune and misfortune are foreordained—*\n*Trace them step by step, and scrutinize with care.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*The **Tianku** star is most inauspicious;*\n*Should it appear, calamity is sure to follow.*\n*Though ancestral estates may be worn away to nothing,*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, one’s years will not be long.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*Baleful stars bring wailing, the greatest of disasters;*\n*Troubles upon troubles enter the household.*\n*If the yearly fate-period encounters this baleful star,*\n*The family will witness wailing and times of decline.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*When **Punishment** and **Wailing** meet, matters are not light;*\n*If the year’s fate encounters them, false alarms arise.*\n*When fortune and emolument are at their peak, guard against childbirth calamity;*\n*People scatter, wealth disperses, and peace is lost.*\n\nThe verse says:\n*The **Tianren** star is the **Sevenfold Harm**;*\n*When it clashes with the yearly fate-period, injury and death are certain.*\n*Unless one relies on the power of hidden virtue,*\n*Disaster and heavy mourning will surely befall.*\n\n**Judgment of the Eighteen Subtle Stars**\n\nThe **Ziwei** star, also called **Purple Qi**, **Great Yang**, **Jade Hall**, or **Lesser Yang**, is close to the noble and honored. The *Jin Treatise* states: This star dwells at the center of the imperial enclosure, most exalted and noble. Auspicious stars can restrain it. When it shines with wisdom and kindness, it presides over long life and wealth. In judging its configuration:\n\nStanding alone above the gate of heaven is called **Bowing to the North Star**, presaging nobility. Residing alone in the *mao* position is called the **Emerging from Chen Configuration**, presaging great nobility. When it shines upon the body and meets with auspicious stars in attendance, this is called the **Pure Radiance Configuration**. When it is at ease in its temple, joyful in its prosperity, or in the *ji-you* temple, this is the **Temple Configuration**; in the *shen-hai* palace, joyful in *zi* prosperity, this is the **Intersecting Palace Configuration**. When one’s fate or destiny encounters it, it bestows a love of the Dao, much talent and knowledge, purple robes and golden belts, honor and esteem, with petty men kept at a distance. If one cultivates kindness and studies the Dao, one may attain the destiny of an immortal.\n\nWhen it shines upon the palace of the body, it grants emolument, a pure and upright office, literary talent, and great wisdom. Dwelling in this palace, it bestows a life of kindness and good fortune. If it does not reside in its temple or prosperity, it becomes a solitary spirit, favoring monks and Daoists who observe fasts and precepts. If it aligns with the **Blade** star, it makes one a recluse among mountains, springs, and rocks. If it meets with dark stars, it inclines one toward lust, a harsh nature, and estrangement from kin. For women, it harms the husband and children. But if it meets with auspicious spirits, it brings honor to the husband and prosperity to the children, with titles and nobility. If it loses its position, it declines and weakens, though even in peril there is deliverance, making one a person of the nine schools.\n\nIn all palace divisions, when it appears in the palace of office and emolument, it bestows high rank, a love of goodness, the planting of virtue, and unwavering adherence to propriety and righteousness. When encountered in the fate-period, it presages an audience with the ruler. This star governing one’s fate bestows an ancient countenance, a plump and full figure, a lean and tall frame, a hunched back, a dull and murky complexion with purple or crimson hues, or a yellowish-white tone. In children, it manifests as a clear, lean, and sallow appearance.\n\nThe verse says:",

      "translated_text": "**Chain Lock Star**, also called the **Treasure Vault**, is the deity of the linked rope. Its alternate names include: **Sudden Wealth**, **Entangling Snare**, **Long Cord**, **Celestial Pardon**, **Celestial Net**, and **Ketu**. This star bears eight names and resides before the Northern Dipper, governing law and restraining violence. When its gate opens, it brings litigation and imprisonment; when it bestows grace, it heralds sudden joy and favorable configurations. The **Entangling Star** presides over penal bonds. If it conjoins the **Body** or **Destiny Palace**, it forms the **Linked-Rope Body-Penalty Configuration**, inviting idle troubles and disputes. When exalted in **Wei**, at peak strength in **Ji**, or joyous in **Hai**, **Mao**, or **Wu**, it bestows abundant wealth upon the Body or Destiny Palace. If it illuminates the Body, Destiny, or annual luck periods, it ensures ample resources, yet one remains entangled in worldly concerns, unable to find peace.\n\nWhenever this star aligns with the **Celestial Treasury** in any palace, and auspicious stars converge, misfortune deepens—yet sudden pardons may dissolve calamities like water. If it meets the **Luan Penalty**, wealth flourishes; if it encounters malevolent stars, litigation multiplies. When afflicted by **Blade** or **Violence**, it portends unnatural death, lewdness, or dissipation. If **Weeping** or **Staff** stars join, early demise follows. Under the influence of evil stars, it brings hanging, suspension, lightning strikes, beast attacks, drifting corpses, maimed limbs, or shattered bodies—leading to a life of toil, devoid of transcendence, marked by pettiness and stinginess.\n\nIn the **Official Fortune Palace**, when aligned with the **Celestial Treasury** and embraced by luck periods, it ensures sudden prosperity. If malevolent stars intervene, separation and disputes arise. For women, the same applies—beware of death in childbirth or ruin through lust, though they may excel in household management.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nThough the Celestial Treasury is called a solitary spirit,\nWhen auspicious stars converge, fame arises.\nMost fortunate is deliverance from peril—\nA life of refined leisure, serene and untroubled.\n\n**Zi:** Earth excess brings rise and fall—\nBlack Paths breed sorrow, resentment, and venomous husbands,\nYet they hoard every trifling gain, accumulating surplus.\n\n**Chou:** Self-made success—\nYet loneliness and hardship prevail, severing ties with kin,\nLike a chicken’s beak, ever grasping, heedless of windfalls.\n\n**Yin:** Sudden demise—\nCurses and malice abound, lacking kindness or filial duty,\nSeeing profit, they forget old pacts, betraying virtue for gain.\n\n**Mao:** Wealthy yet afflicted—\nLame limbs, wind-borne ailments, devoid of warmth or propriety,\nLacking human decency, their conduct befits beasts, without the depth of water or wood.\n\n**Chen:** First ruin, then success—\nMourning and misfortune at the door, thunderous shocks from tigers.\nProceed with utmost care—only cautious alliances ensure strength,\nUnsought blessings arrive late, like a caged bird.\n\n**Si:** Established amidst peril—\nThe power of seals and emoluments, the image of official rank,\nJoy in the Taiyi Palace: tigers retreat, halls stand secure,\nThe lord’s favor brings the minister’s peace, their virtue renowned in the court.\n\n**Wu:** The Star flourishes in Wu—\nWealth and emoluments remain unscathed, yet wife and children become illusions.\nEvil conjunctions invite calamity; auspicious rays meet obstruction,\nThey chase trifles, unaware of impending betrayal.\n\n**Wei:** Solitary and scattered, yet gathering—\nPenal bonds and solitude sever ties with kin,\nWithout malevolent stars, fortune prevails—yet the heart strays from the law,\nThe body pursues profit, lost in its path.\n\n**Shen:** Aligned with the Killing Palace—\nSchemes and poisons lurk in shadows, harming without loss of fortune,\nSelf-inflicted ruin, tainting the good with filth.\n\n**You:** Self-made in You—\nWhen the Chain Lock enters the Earth Palace, wives and concubines grow estranged,\nMothers are doomed, mourning arrives—\nFortune and misfortune diverge, their fates mournful.\n\n**Xu:** Hardship in Xu—\nThe Celestial Right Star nears nobility, bestowing robes and emoluments,\nYet evil may lead to self-strangulation—\nHow different is this from burglary? What separates it from robbery?\n\n**Hai:** Pure and noble in Hai—\nA wandering official’s fortune, the blessings of solitude and emptiness,\nIn the realm of the Double Fish, when Body and Destiny converge,\nAffairs of the Golden Horse and Jade Hall unfold.\n\n**Literary Star**, also called the **Terrace Assistant**, governs imperial examinations, scholarly brilliance, and literary grace. Known as **Tiankui**, **Three Terraces**, **Phoenix Pavilion**, **Celestial Marvel**, **Wenqu**, and the **Six Officers of the Southern Dipper**, it presides over nobility, learning, and celestial emoluments. In configurations, when **Wenqu** is exalted or at peak strength, it forms the **Laurel and Kui Ascendancy**. When joyous in **Wu** or **Xu** within the Body or Destiny Palace, it bestows later literary excellence, high ranks, and the path to generalship or ministerial office. When exalted and illuminating any palace, it grants eloquence and literary talent, ensuring success in imperial examinations. In exaltation, it bestows extraordinary intellect, mastery of classical texts, and the potential for generalship or ministerial roles. Wherever it resides, affairs are conducted with elegance. When meeting auspicious stars, it heralds great nobility and literary fame. If malevolent stars intervene, early ambitions falter, and one may be born of a concubine. Afflicted by **Blade** or **Penalty**, it breeds arrogance and cruelty. Under **Blade**, it brings malice, harm to parents, discord among siblings, and a life of emptiness. With **Mao Tou**, it severs ancestral ties. Under **Penalty**, it fosters ruthlessness, inviting disaster. With **Weeping**, it brings harm and loss. With **Yao Yi**, it leads to licentiousness. Even when conjoined with other stars, it is called a solitary spirit. In its place of strength, it bestows unmatched purity and nobility, benevolence, integrity, and unwavering trust. Out of its element, it breeds arrogance, aloofness, reclusion, and solitude. For women, it incites lust. With **Mao** or **Yao Yi**, it marks a base and vulgar person; with **Penalty** or **Blade**, cruelty ensues.\n\nIn the **Official Fortune Palace**, it fosters propriety and blessings, avoiding idle matters.

When exalted in **Zi (Rat)**, **Shen (Monkey)**, or **Hai (Pig)**, or in its own palace of **Wei (Goat)**, it brings entanglement in legal nets and punishments—unless rescued by benevolent stars. If afflicted by **Execution** or malignant stars in the same palace, it brings death by beating, or else violent ends: mauling, tiger attack, lightning strike, drowning, or wolf-inflicted wounds. In this palace with **Blade**, it brings violent death; the person is reckless, defiant, and brutally strong-willed. Even when exalted in noble positions, it brings harsh punishments and failure to attain rank. When conjoined with malevolent stars, it brings bloodshed and harm; the person is quick to anger and often beaten. If met by the **Celestial Seal** in the same palace, it grants authority and eminence. With **Purple Fortune**, it brings nobility and longevity, wielding benevolent power and high esteem. When in its **Treasury** and well-placed, it brings wealth and authority. With **Noble Person** in exaltation, it brings fortune and long life. With **Luan**, it brings refined elegance. With **Literary Star**, it brings solitude. With malevolent stars and **Punishment**, it harms parents and maims limbs. With **Quarrel**, it brings strife with spouse and heirs; kin offer little support, bonds lack affection—so too for men and women. With **Yao**, it brings lust; with **Deception**, cunning; with **Weeping**, a fractious nature. With **Blade**, it brings legal execution. For women, it brings a stern, forthright nature, capable in affairs. With auspicious stars, it turns ominous; with **Mao** or **Yi**, it brings remarriage. For men, it brings departure from ancestral home to stand alone. With **Punishment**, it brings misfortune, inciting lawsuits and inviting trouble.

With a calm heart, obstacles yield; in court and hall, one appears composed.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**You (Rooster):** You brings calamity; only with auspicious stars does strength arise. Whether in right or wrong, success or failure, one drifts like duckweed to foreign lands.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Xu (Dog):** Xu is called the **Distressed Wanderer**; to meet it is to invite chaos. What is built is also broken; only in old age does one begin anew.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Hai (Pig):** The **Supply Star** enters Hai’s palace, its qi and tuan entirely at ease. In its subtle, far-reaching applications, fame is won and great merit achieved.\n\n---\n\nThe **Celestial Anomaly Star** is also named **Separation, Ruin, Foundation-Breaker, Controller of Strange Omens, Celestial Solitude, Anomalous Womb, Earthly Plunder, Iron Axe, Controller of Strange Portents**. It governs the aberrations and disorders of heaven and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, as well as the monstrous births of birds, beasts, grasses, and trees. Those born in the southern ruins often study strange and uncanny matters, their fortunes rising and falling unpredictably. It delights in the Chen, Chou, Wei, and Mao palaces of the **Body** and **Destiny**—here, it severs ancestral ties and severs one from home. When its double influence shines upon a palace, it brings separation and change of surname. If it aligns with benevolent stars in a flourishing or exalted position, fortune follows. But if it shares a palace with malevolent stars in a debilitated position, it breeds deceit, poor judgment of others, and lack of respect. Yet in flourishing positions, it remains auspicious, indicating a fate of illegitimate birth. With malevolent stars, it brings great upheaval; with auspicious stars, unexpected joy. When it enters a flourishing position, it bestows nobility. If it directly illuminates, one may still gain a wife’s wealth. With auspicious constellations, it tightens the bonds of rank, spreading fame across the land. When it meets **Nobility** in a strong position, one’s name blazes with glory, though often accompanied by licentiousness. With **Wenchang**, it brings reputation, but early setbacks. With **Luan**, it brings charm; with **Fortune and Emolument**, enjoyment; with **Seal and Longevity**, power, fortune, and cunning. With **Treasury and Wealth**, sudden rise and swift pursuit; with malevolent stars and **Emptiness**, treachery, deceit, and shamelessness. With **Yao** and the **Nine Punishments**, cruelty and harm befall parents, siblings become like enemies, spouses part, children are lost—like gold in sand, so too for men and women. For women, it brings elopement. In the **Official Career** palace, it brings unusual wealth, but affairs are ever-changing. It should not appear in the **Spouse** palace, where it brings separation and loss, harming the three palaces, leaving one as if nonexistent, beset by illness. With **Yao**, it brings strange ailments. In the **Fields and Estates** palace, it destroys ancestral property. In the **Wealth** palace, it dissipates resources. When encountered in annual cycles or transits, it brings shocking anomalies, misfortune, and financial loss.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nWhen the **Rod** and **Anomaly** align to illuminate the **Destiny** palace, one changes name and surname, finding joy in shared fate. If not an adopted child or born of a concubine, one may yet see parents twice over.\n\n**Tuan says:**\nWhen the **Celestial Anomaly** resides in a flourishing position, all ventures prosper. Plans and undertakings succeed as wished; one must surely innovate and transform the family gate.\n\n**Tuan says:**\n**Zi (Rat):** Abandoning ancestors, it is called the **Jade Pool Star**—nature is clever and bright, gaining emolument from the northwest. If it meets malevolent stars, disaster and illness follow. For Daoists and monks, it brings long life; it severs ancestral ties.\n\n**Chou (Ox):** One goes forth to meet noble admiration, with literary fame. If malevolent stars clash or illuminate, it brings disaster, illness, and harm—sons are unfilial, daughters unvirtuous.\n\n**Yin (Tiger):** It governs song, music, and exquisite dance. If malevolent stars clash, one toils in hardship; with auspicious stars, peace follows.\n\n**Mao (Rabbit):** Born of a concubine, nature is cunning yet unfulfilled. With **Mourning** and **Punishment**, kin are left solitary, and one remains poor and lowly.\n\n**Chen (Dragon):** It brings greed for wealth and grain, inviting right and wrong. If no malevolent stars break the three directions, one becomes a renowned scholar, yet severs ancestral ties.\n\n**Si (Snake):** It governs the heroic and talented, with artful literature. The **Jade Maiden** is most favorable; with **Punishment**, men and women gain official rank, and women wear the cap. Often meeting **Treasury and Wealth**, with **Purple** and auspicious stars, fortune follows.\n\n**Wu (Horse):** This palace is not noble; men are clever but fear **Celestial Yao**, with many failures and few successes. Solitary and short-lived, even auspicious stars bring only mediocrity.\n\n**Wei (Goat):** One suffers oppression, with clever schemes and a fair countenance. Ancestral foundations are ruined; with auspicious illumination, one gains a profession. Yet meeting **Longevity** and **Thigh** brings harm to parents, though poverty holds hidden fortune.\n\n**Shen (Monkey):** Fortune and emolument are both complete. Entering the **Purple Forbidden** star, glory and descendants follow; sons gain wives, wealth flourishes, and the household is warm and prosperous.\n\n**You (Rooster):** Following a woman’s whims, one strays high—men leave home, women remarry, and through dissipation, ruin comes.\n\n**Xu (Dog):** It brings harm, punishment, and short life; prison cannot be avoided. Solitary, it severs the six relations; the self remains mediocre.\n\n**Hai (Pig):** Fortune and emolument illuminate the ancestral pivot, governing the court and palace. In the **Fortune and Virtue** direction, fame spreads; meeting **Treasury, Luan, and Purple**, one attains wealth and nobility.\n\n---\n\nThe **Mao-Head Star**, also called the **Celestial Broom**, **Interloper**, or **Sweeping Comet**, is a star of ominous portent. When it guards a palace, it brings two years of disaster and famine. Wherever it shines, misfortune follows.",

      "translated_text": "It also portends violent disaster and death. When in **Zi (Rat)** or **Mao (Rabbit)**, it is at its peak; when in **Wei (Goat)** or **Xu (Dog)**, it delights in **Yin (Tiger)** or the **Life Palace**, making one’s nature fierce and violent, rebellious and fond of killing, daring and strong. Wherever it shines upon a palace, misfortune follows. If encountered, the household will lack four walls. When meeting auspicious stars, one gains authority. If conjoined with malevolent stars, it brings calamity. Dwelling in this palace, one must break from ancestors, though affairs proceed swiftly. When in its temple or at peak strength, it governs military authority, surely raising banners, standards, and battle-axes. Meeting auspicious stars with nobility in its temple, one attains official emolument and illustrious glory. Conjoined with **Fortune and Virtue**, one breaks from ancestors to establish a household. Conjoined with **Seal and Longevity**, one gains glory and long life. Conjoined with **Wenchang**, one remains pure and solitary. Conjoined with **Treasury**, one is truly wealthy and prosperous. Meeting malevolent stars with **Punishment and Blade**, one harms parents, siblings, wife, and children. It also portends early death in one’s prime. Conjoined with **Punishment**, one is fond of killing; with **Void**, one suffers poverty, cold, and many disasters; with **Weeping**, one becomes a shaman, physician, or one of the nine humble trades, and dies away from home. Conjoined with **Void and Weeping**, one suffers epidemics. When **Three Stars**, **Void Star**, or malevolent stars reside in the **Life Palace** with **Mao**, it foretells a violent and early death. It also portends greed, lewdness, and lust. Meeting **Treasury**, one establishes oneself independently, often staying abroad—if a monk or Daoist, one dies in a foreign land.\n\nIn the **Official Emolument Palace**, one fears nothing, sets firm resolve, and makes decisions without doubt. In the **Migration and Fortune Palaces**, one avoids peril and hardship. When transiting or annual stars shine upon it without auspicious stars, one suffers official disasters, water calamities, and extraordinary misfortunes. For women, it is the same, portending childbirth difficulties and weakness in the lungs. If meeting auspicious stars to assist, one may gain or lose fortune through licentiousness, inviting disaster.

In the **Purple Tenuity Enclosure**, it governs matters of yin virtue but also brings harm and injury. In structural analysis, when it resides in the **Life Palace** of men or women alongside **Blade** and **Treasury**, forming the **Zi Blade Purple Configuration**, it surely destroys the household. When in its temple in **Si (Snake)** or **Shen (Monkey)**, at peak strength in **Wu (Horse)**, or delighting in **Yin (Tiger)** or the **Life Palace**, one’s nature is cruel and wolfish, fond of killing and slaughter, often dying by the blade in battle. Wherever it shines upon a palace, it governs the authority of war and punishment. Meeting malevolent stars, one suffers injury and ruin; meeting auspicious stars, one harms others in silence but can resolve matters favorably. When in its temple and conjoined with auspicious stars, one holds military authority but cannot avoid falling in battle, suffering blood diseases, or being exiled, surely enduring flogging, humiliation, and penal servitude. Meeting auspicious stars with **Purple Tenuity**, misfortune is half reduced. Conjoined with **Treasury** or **Luan**, one has wealth but often dies by hanging, drowning, or beast-inflicted injury. Conjoined with **Seal** or **Longevity**, one may have illness but survive; otherwise, one dies young. Conjoined with **Wenchang**, one holds authority but remains solitary. Conjoined with **Luan**, one is harmed by lust. Conjoined with **Nobility**, one holds authority but meets no good end. Conjoined with **Fortune and Emolument**, one’s fortune is incomplete. Conjoined with **Punishment**, one dies violently. Conjoined with **Mao**, one dies young. Conjoined with **Yao**, one is lewd and dies young. Conjoined with **Void**, one is insubstantial and deceitful; with **Weeping**, one is solitary and harms others. For women, it portends difficult childbirth, strange postpartum illnesses, and weakness in the lungs. In the **Official Emolument Palace**, one’s nature is fierce and violent, not harming others. In the **Migration Palace**, it is inauspicious to encounter; when transiting or in annual stars, it brings sudden disasters and misfortunes—only families that accumulate goodness may avoid them. If conjoined with **Yao** and strange stars, one dies lewdly and young, establishing a separate lineage, and one’s offspring are of a different kind. Neither men nor women should have this star in their **Life Palace**.\n\n**Verse:**\nIn **Zi**, one indulges in lust, has beautiful women, suffers strange moans and toil, and wanders to the end—yet it is not entirely bad.\nIn **Chou**, one is drawn to the uncanny, fond of shamans and sorcerers, with flourishing wealth and fields.\nMeeting auspicious stars, misfortune is reduced; meeting malevolent stars, one dies by the uncanny.\nOne practices incantations, writes talismans, and is shamelessly content.\nIn **Yin**, one dies for lust; women perish from lewdness.\nMen are often foolish and dull, mere commoners, with conduct as chaotic as beasts.\nIn **Mao**, one harms the six relations, suffers from madness and illness, punishes one’s wife, and harms one’s children.\nMeeting malevolent stars, one dies young and suffers poverty; even with auspicious stars, it is often mediocre.\nIn **Chen**, one has ample celestial emolument, but in middle age, one wanders and toils.",

      "translated_text": "A life spent in vain busyness, with wealth and emolument uncertain in abundance.\n\nIn **Si**, wealth and emolument dissipate; one dies abroad, leaving descendants orphaned and suffering. Meeting auspicious stars may resolve this, but encountering malevolent stars brings certain harm—the blessings are faint, the misfortunes grave.\n\nIn **Wu**, one is solitary and estranged, fond of lust. In the wife’s palace, one consorts with outsiders, yet observes propriety and ritual; still, one harms and severs the six relations, with mourning imminent, visible before one’s eyes.\n\nIn **Wei**, the six relations bring harm, and affairs succeed or fail unpredictably. Meeting auspicious stars brings improvement, but if malevolent stars appear, one cannot preserve what one has—all is show without substance.\n\nIn **Shen**, evil companions bring harm, though some good may yet arise. Even with auspicious stars overhead, they cannot avert disaster. When the fortune star arrives, misfortune manifests outwardly.\n\nIn **You**, one lacks steadfast nature, and actions are often reversed. One’s temperament is unstable, bringing harm and cruel punishments.\n\nIn **Xu**, celestial misfortune and fire stars bring abundant wealth and emolument, yet one fears malevolent stars. When the limit meets evil stars, one harms and severs parents, spouse, and children, whose lives are cut short, bringing disaster and illness.\n\nIn **Hai**, harm is inevitable in the Hai palace, but emolument and position come through influential women. Those of high rank gain favor and office, their chambers and walls pure in loyalty. The celestial punishment star is called by ten names: Celestial Cannon, Fire Star, Death Talisman, Beginning Strike, Ketu, Void, Fire Virtue, Celestial Dog, Celestial Authority, and Celestial Harm. These are alternate names for Ketu, which opposes Rahu and is also called the Celestial Tail Star, governing military and penal affairs. When the Purple Tenuity faces south, it becomes the constellation of chariot and cavalry generals. Meeting it brings noble fortune, authority, and honor, with loyalty shining like the sun and integrity as unyielding as frost. It governs official disasters in structural fate, and when the execution star resides in the brothers’ palace, it forms the Broken Goose pattern. Together with Void and positioned in Mao, it is called the Sitting Thunder Gate pattern. When in its temple in Yin, flourishing in Chen, joyful in You, or in the Wu palace of the body and life palaces, it governs temperament, often redressing others’ injustices. If it illuminates this palace, it brings violent death; even with benevolent stars to mitigate, one may still face exile. If aligned with the Red Thread, flourishing in its temple, one avoids the calamity of imprisonment. In Xu, all is connected; if it loses its position, legal death is certain, and one will surely suffer from lameness, hunchback, or ailments of the waist, legs, or back. If it gains a favorable position, misfortune is lightened. When meeting auspicious stars and the Purple Tenuity in its proper place, one’s reputation and status are noble and weighty. If it loses its position, one still suffers illness, disaster, and injury. When aligned with nobility, one achieves prominence; with Literary Brilliance, one is in its temple and becomes solitary; with Treasury or Thread, one gains fame through wealth; with Seal and Longevity, one holds power; with Phoenix, one possesses civil and martial talent; with Fortune and Emolument, one is not entirely complete; with Hair, one is disfigured and fond of martial arts; with Staff, one holds authority. If in Void, one is poor and thin, yet must have a reputation, though it is more hollow than substantial. With the Strange star, one is adopted or becomes a son-in-law; with Blade, one faces exile or penal servitude; with Hair and Blade, one dies prematurely. For women, it brings harm to husbands and children, the decline of the maternal family, and the perils of childbirth and weakness. With the Yao star, one is wanton and elopes; with the Strange star, one remarries; with Phoenix, one brings fortune and emolument to her husband and receives honors; with Longevity, one enjoys a long life. If the official emolument palace meets auspicious stars, the migration palace faces dangers of water, fire, bandits, and thieves. When the flow of fortune and the year’s limit encounter it, one suffers disasters and losses.\n\nIn **Zi**, the Zi palace brings sorrow; meeting malevolent stars brings punishment and harm, poison and obstruction, short life, severed six relations, and persistent illness.\n\nIn **Chou**, the Chou palace brings much harm, greed for wealth, and ruin. Malevolent limits sever both parents, and early success leads to later ruin.\n\nIn **Yin**, the martial Yin, dwelling as the Tiger’s Might, resides in the temple of seals and emoluments. As a favored minister, one lives in ease; as a wild goose tower, one surely attains the Secretariat. If struck by malevolent stars, men harm their wives and children, while women become stern and widowed, with few children before thirty and youthful afflictions of thick blood.\n\nIn **Mao**, one suffers from waist and eye ailments, punishment, and harm, unable to find peace. Monks and Daoists may fare well, but one’s life is solitary and lonely.\n\nIn **Chen**, the Chen palace harbors a treacherous heart; when granted office, one encounters the terror of tigers and snakes. Punishment and misfortune bring injury and death—only meeting auspicious stars like the Rabbit brings relief.\n\nIn **Si**, the Si palace harms wives and children; the unyielding Luo and Gang stars bring extraordinary harm. Success and failure have no fixed time, and one is born with a hasty and rigid temperament.\n\nIn **Wu**, one dies abroad, meeting an early end, cursed by malevolent and wicked people. One harms wives and children, severs the six relations, and should blame oneself more than others.\n\nIn **Wei**, the Wei palace mixes good and ill fortune, with wives and children changing two or three times. The six relations suffer harm, one must break from ancestors, and leaving home to become a monk or Daoist may bring long life.\n\nIn **Shen**, the Shen palace brings yin poison and punishment, severing parents in early years. Without the aid of auspicious stars, disasters and dangers are anything but ordinary.\n\nIn **You**, the You palace surely brings punishment and harm; in civil or martial pursuits, one’s wives and children are doomed. In youth, one loses parents and suffers illness, meeting an early end.\n\nIn **Xu**, when pacifying the frontier in times of war, the Xu palace’s emolument star belongs to the three auspicious directions. If one’s name must be achieved alone, success comes without scheming.\n\nIn **Hai**, the Hai palace brings solitude and hollow emolument, yet literary talent severs worldly ties. Stirring heaven and moving earth, celestial emolument naturally arrives.\n\nThe Celestial Yao star is called the Celestial Debauchery and Mysterious Harlot, governing music, peach blossoms, and the collision of hairpins, a constellation of wind, flow, seduction, and absurdity. When this star resides in the palace enclosure, it specializes in lewd and filthy affairs. In structural fate, when positioned in Zi, it forms the Flower Essence Treasure King pattern, governing lewdness and chaos. Flourishing in Mao, Xu, and Chen, joyful in Hai, and in the body and life palaces, it governs a yin-poisoned temperament, chaotic and suspicious, with a fondness for beauty but shallow fortune. If in its eight temples and flourishing, one is wealthy and noble, with many servants. In Hai, it is called the Ascending Clarity Palace, possessing talent that surpasses the age.",

      "translated_text": "When encountering auspicious stars, one indulges in flowers and wine. When meeting malevolent stars, one ruins family and career, suffers punishment or death due to lust. In the Six Harmonies, one dies young. If residing in the Life Palace in decline, marriage occurs without deliberation, hand-in-hand unions form; meeting auspicious stars adds longevity, with long life; in the Treasury, wealth; in the Purple Palace, hardness and softness balance, with charm; in the Noble Palace, many delusions and concubines; in the Phoenix, lewdness; meeting inauspicious stars brings misfortune; in the Punishment Blade Palace, harm to parents and wife and children; in the Sibling Palace, disorder like crows in flight; with the Staff, fondness for beauty; near nobility, often reduced to servitude, scribes and clerks; with the Strange, ancestral lewdness and lowly solitude; with the Hair, ancestral ruin through lewdness, or heedless of others’ words; with the Weeping, cruelty and poison; in the Official Salary Palace, much emptiness and little substance, ensnaring others; in the Illness and Misfortune Palace, not to be seen, governing strange illnesses and violent harm, bodily damage from lust and wine. In fate and fortune, all are inauspicious. Residing in its temple brings fortune, with beautiful appearance and elegant bearing, charming and cunning, full of schemes, often inciting disputes, indulging in wine, lust, extravagance, and gambling—this is the foremost trait. Men under its influence are all thus. Women with the Weeping and Hair stars suffer hanging or death in childbirth.\n\n**Judgment:**\n**Zi:** The Zi Palace’s Mourning Guest governs cunning and intrigue, scheming and early death, leaving one orphaned. Women become lowly prostitutes, harming children and husbands.\n**Chou:** The Weeping star in the Chou Palace brings awe-inspiring severity, literary and martial nobility with authority. Meeting malevolent stars brings high rank; in the nine schools, medical skill excels. This star, when used in civil or military roles, makes one a prime minister or feudal lord—if not struck by malevolent stars, one becomes a master of the nine schools.\n**Yin:** The Yin Palace invites crime and punishment, imprisonment and official calamity. When inauspicious stars clash, one suffers orphanhood and poverty, unable to amass wealth. This star early harms parents, shortens life with severe illness; in the Life Palace, it is inauspicious. If aided by auspicious stars, fortune and prosperity flourish.\n**Mao:** Fierce and lustful, with auspicious stars it reverses to fortune. Wealth and salary flourish, but malevolent stars bring ruin.\n**Chen:** The Breaking Army’s fierce and robust image—if the three directions meet malevolent stars, one harms parents, lives as an illegitimate child dependent on relatives.\n**Si:** The Si Palace brings blade wounds and poison harm to life. Meeting Heavenly Fortune or Heavenly Staff reduces harm by half; women become widows. Meeting the Red Phoenix, one is harmed by lust and dies in a foreign land.\n**Wu:** Literary talent with a reputation, meeting opportunity brings noble rank, official prominence, and fine robes. Inauspicious turns auspicious; the Star of the Hanging Net governs shamans, physicians, monks, and Daoists.\n**Wei:** Governs charm, blood illness, and death; if the Official Salary Palace aids, one still dies young. Meeting the Red Phoenix star reduces harm by half.\n**Shen:** Defies norms, disrupts family order, first ruins then rebuilds. Meeting malevolence brings severe illness, death, and loss of literary grace.\n**You:** One’s name is recorded in history, salary and rank rise high. The You Palace’s Arrow Star brings harm from blades and arrows. With malevolent stars, punishment harms the six relations, causing parental death, ruin, orphanhood, and family decline.\n**Xu:** Loses position through ferocity; malevolent stars bring official calamity and violence. This palace governs orphanhood, poverty, and misfortune, with evil befalling the body.\n**Hai:** The Hai Palace in yin evil dissipates family wealth. Malevolent stars bring official calamity and many deaths in childbirth. If malevolent stars strike, men suffer official misfortune; women endure difficult births. The star’s transit through fate determines fortune or misfortune.\n\nWhen the Purple Tenuity star guards fate, it brings honor, promotion, and joyous events; commoners’ enterprises prosper, scholars gain reputation, nobles advance in rank, monks and Daoists enjoy pure blessings, and women strengthen their husbands’ families. The three directions of Hai and Mao meeting auspicious stars bring imperial audience and honor; commoners rise in the world.\n\n**Heavenly Void:**\nThe Heavenly Void is named for emptiness; when its star guards fate, it brings hollow fame, financial loss, and peril, with sudden wealth elusive. There are false alarms, empty joys, mourning for women and children, funerary clothes, and financial ruin. When Punishment, Weeping, Yao, and Blade stars converge, one suffers from swelling and poisoning. Void meeting Punishment and Killing stars in fate brings hidden family misfortune, long-term official restraint, and inauspiciousness in all matters, leading to consumptive weakness. It also governs poverty, orphanhood, and suffering, with life’s good things turning to nothing, all affairs ending in vain—like a dream.",

Those of high rank wield the power of three seals, holding life and death in their grasp. If positioned in a flourishing and exalted palace, they command armies and govern the people, wielding military authority. Even ordinary folk who encounter nobility, or monks and Daoists, attain esteemed positions.
