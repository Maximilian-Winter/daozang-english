  "full_translation": "**Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon: Lost Treatise of *Suwen***\n(*Alternative Titles: Lost Treatise of *Suwen*, *Suwen*’s Unorthodox Chapter*)\n**Authorship & Date Unknown**—attributed in one tradition to **Song-era Liu Wenshu (刘温舒)**. Five volumes in total. Original source: *The Orthodox Daoist Canon* (**正统道藏**), *Taixuan* (太玄) section. Cross-referenced with: **Yuan-dynasty woodblock edition**, **Ming-era *Jiajing* (嘉靖) Zhao Respectful Study Hall edition** (*Huangdi Neijing Suwen*, abbreviated hereafter as the **Ming woodblock edition**).\n\n**Table of Contents**\nVolume One: *Treatise on Needling Methods, Part One*\nVolume Two: *Treatise on Needling Methods, Part Two*\nVolume Three: *Treatise on Needling Methods, Part Three*\nVolume Four: *Treatise on Diseases, Part One*\nVolume Five: *Treatise on Diseases, Part Two*\n\n---\n\n**Lost Treatise of *Suwen*, Volume One: *Treatise on Needling Methods, Part One***\n\nThe Yellow Emperor inquired:\n*\"When ascent and descent falter, and the exchange of **qi** undergoes change, violent stagnation ensues—this I already understand. But how may one preemptively rescue life, and thus avert such calamity?\"*\n(*\"Avert\"* here means \"remove/ward off.\" How then does one remove it?*)\n\nQibo bowed twice, then replied:\n*\"Illuminating, Your Majesty’s question! Your servant has heard the Master say: Once one has mastered the **Heavenly Elements** (**天元**), one must exhaust the **Dao/Way of Needling** (**法刺**), thereby able to subdue stagnation and bolster circulation, reinforce weakness to preserve wholeness, drain excess and retain what is needed, and eliminate this suffering.\"*\n(*The \"Master\" refers to **Zhongshu Yi Dai** (**仪贷季**), the venerable ancestral teacher.*)\n(*\"Subdue\"* means to \"overcome/vanquish.\" \"Bolster\" means to \"support/assist.\" \"Retain\"* is here rendered as *\"preserve\"* to align with the context of **qi** regulation. *\"Lay\"* means \"remove.\" *\"This\"* refers to the suffering.*)\n\nThe Emperor said:\n*\"I wish to hear it fully.\"*\n\nQibo said:\n*\"When **Wood** (**木**) cannot ascend, disaster is imminent. The **Heavenly Pillar** (**天柱**) obstructs and represses it; if **Wood** seeks to erupt in stagnation, it must await the proper time. The time for **Wood** to erupt is when **Heaven** generates the **Yin-questioning **qi** (**问气**). When that moment arrives, one may needle it preemptively. The appropriate point is the **Well** (**井**) of **Foot Jueyin** (**足厥阴**).*\n(*The **Well** of **Foot Jueyin** is **Dadun** (**大敦**)—located at the tip of the big toe, above the nail like a scallion leaf, within the space of three hairs, being the origin point of **Foot Jueyin**.*)\n\nOn an ordinary day, two hours before noon (**水下一刻**), place your hand over the point and feel the pulsation of the **dynamic pulse** (**动脉**). Insert the needle to a depth of three **cun** (of the patient’s body measurement), and retain it for six breaths. If **qi** is encountered, withdraw it swiftly. Needle the left side first, then the right. Alternatively, one may also needle this point on the **Spring Equinox** (**春分**), and no such stagnation will occur.\n\n*\"When **Fire** (**火**) cannot ascend, the **Heavenly Cover** (**天蓬**) obstructs and represses it; if **Fire** seeks to erupt in stagnation, it must also await the proper time. The time for **Fire** to erupt is when **Heaven** generates the **Left-questioning **qi** (**左问气**). Its eruption occurs when the **Master Fire** (**君火**) is at the **Spring Equinox** (**春分**), and the **Associate Fire** (**相火**) is at **Xiaoman** (**小满**). Thus, one may needle it preemptively during these two times.*\n(*Both **Master Fire** and **Associate Fire** share the same needling method: the **Honor** (**荣**) point of the **Heart’s Pericardial Envelope** (**心包络**).*)\n(*The **Honor** point of the **Heart’s Pericardial Envelope** is **Laoguan** (**劳官**), located in the center of the palm.*)\n\nTwo hours before noon (**水下二刻**), press the point with your hand until the **dynamic pulse** (**动脉**) responds. Insert the needle to a depth of three **cun** (of the patient’s body measurement), and retain it for six breaths. If **qi** is encountered, withdraw it swiftly—needling the left side first, then the right. Another method: needle this point during the **three sweats of spring** (**春三泄汗**).\n\n*\"When **Earth** (**土**) cannot ascend, the **Heavenly Collision** (**天冲**) obstructs and represses it; if **Earth** seeks to erupt in stagnation, it must also await the proper time. The time for **Earth** to erupt is when **Heaven** generates the **Left-questioning **qi** (**左问气**). The day of its eruption is **Wei** (**维**), specifically the **Wei of Chen** (**辰维**), which often occurs during the **two questioning times** (**二问维**). Thus, one may needle it preemptively. The appropriate point is the **Yin** (**俞**) of **Foot Taiyin** (**足太阴**).*\n(*The **Yin** point of **Foot Taiyin** is **Taibai** (**太白**), located in the depression below the medial malleolus on the inner side of the foot, where **Foot Taiyin** converges.*)\n\nThree hours before noon (**水下三刻**), insert the needle to a depth of two **cun** (of the patient’s body measurement), and retain it for seven breaths. If **qi** arrives, withdraw it swiftly—needling the left side first, then the right.\n\n**Metal** seeks to ascend, yet **Heaven**’s **Ying** (**英**) restrains and suppresses it. When **Metal** desires to erupt and disperse its stagnation, it too must await its proper time.\n\nWhen **Metal**’s stagnation awaits its time, it is when **Heaven** generates the **Left-questioning qi**. After the summer solstice, when **Metal**’s stagnation is ready to erupt, it occurs in the phase when **Fire** reigns supreme—here, one may needle it preemptively.\n\nThe appropriate channel to needle is **Hand Taiyin**. The **Hand Taiyin** channel’s **Jingqu** (**经渠**) point lies in the depression between the two tendons on the inner forearm, where **Hand Taiyin** courses. When the pulse responds to pressure, four hours before noon (**水下四刻**), insert the needle to a depth of three **cun** (of the patient’s body measurement), retaining it for three breaths. If **qi** arrives, withdraw the needle swiftly—needling the left side first, then the right.\n\n**Water** seeks to ascend, yet **Heaven**’s **Nei** (**内**) restrains and suppresses it. When **Water** desires to erupt and disperse its stagnation, it too must await its proper time.\n\nWhen **Water**’s stagnation awaits its time, it is when **Heaven** generates the **Left-questioning qi**. Its eruption occurs after the **Chenwei** (**辰维**), when **Fire** attains its reign—here, **Water** may be acted upon with needle therapy preemptively.\n\nThe appropriate convergence point to needle is **Foot Shaoyin**. The **Foot Shaoyin** convergence is the **Yinggu** (**阴谷**) point, located behind the inner knee’s medial condyle, beneath the large tendon and above the small tendon. Pressing it yields a response; it is found when the knee is flexed, where **Foot Shaoyin** enters. Insert the needle to a depth of four **cun** (of the patient’s body measurement), retaining it for three breaths. If the **qi** responds to pressure, needle it swiftly, withdrawing first from the left, then the right.\n\nThe **Emperor** said: *\"When **Wood** ascends but does not advance, it can be preemptively addressed. I wish to hear of its descent—how one may guard against it in advance.\"* (This is about **preventive measures**.) **Qibo** replied: *\"Having understood its ascent, one must necessarily grasp its descent. The **Dao/Way** of ascent and descent can all be treated in advance. One can also needle it before its ascent.*\n\nWhen **Wood** seeks to descend but **Earth**’s **Jing** (**晶**, crystalline) **chamber** obstructs and suppresses it, it descends without entering, and the suppression causes stagnation and eruption. When it disperses, its position can be determined. If it does not descend in three days, it will descend in eight days. When it seeks to descend but stagnation first disperses, then **Earth**’s **Wen** (**问**, questioning) **qi** may emerge. When stagnation erupts during descent, it is sudden like the **Heavenly** **qi** awaiting its time; when it descends but does not descend fully, the stagnation can be swiftly addressed. When descent is not complete, the **qi** erupts rapidly like **Heavenly** stagnation—then it can be needled.\n\nDescending can be achieved by **folding** its **victory** (i.e., its dominant element). **Folding** its **victory** weakens its **standard** (manifestation) while emptying its **root** (source), so it weakens its **victory**. One should needle where **Hand Taiyin** emerges and where **Hand Yangming** enters.\n\nWhere **Hand Taiyin** emerges is the **Shaochang** (**少商**) point, located on the inner side of the thumb’s tip, one **cun** (of the patient’s body measurement) from the nail like the length of a **chive leaf**. It is the **well** of **Hand Taiyin**. Needling should reach one **cun**, retaining the needle for two breaths, then withdrawing swiftly.\n\nWhere **Hand Yangming** enters is the **Quchai** (**曲池**) point, located below the outer knee’s medial condyle, in the depression between the two bones when the elbow is flexed. It is the **convergence** of **Hand Yangming**. Needling should reach one and a half **cun**, retaining the needle for seven breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds.\n\nWhen **Fire** seeks to descend but **Earth**’s **Xuan** (**玄**, mysterious) **chamber** obstructs and suppresses it, it descends without entering, and the suppression causes stagnation and eruption. When it disperses, it can enter. If it does not descend in two days, it will descend in seven days. When it seeks to descend but stagnation disperses, it can be needled swiftly. One should **fold** its **victory** to disperse the stagnation. **Fire**’s stagnation can be **folded** by **Water**—this can remove it.\n\nOne should needle where **Foot Shaoyin** emerges and where **Foot Taiyang** enters. Where **Foot Shaoyin** emerges is the **Yongquan** (**涌泉**) point, located in the depression at the sole’s center, where the toes curl inward when the foot is flexed. It is the **well** of **Foot Shaoyin**. Needling should reach three **cun**, retaining the needle for three breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds, first the left, then the right.\n\nWhere **Foot Taiyang** enters is the **Weizhong** (**委中**) point, located three **cun** below the knee, in the depression outside the **shinbone** (**腑骨**) between the two tendons. It is the **convergence** of **Foot Taiyang**. Needling should reach five **cun**, retaining the needle for seven breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds, first the left, then the right. Repeat this method twice.\n\nWhen **Earth** seeks to descend but **Earth**’s **Cang** (**苍**, azure) **chamber** obstructs and suppresses it, it descends without entering, and the suppression causes stagnation and eruption. When it disperses, it can enter. If it does not descend in five days, it will descend in ten days. When it seeks to descend but stagnation disperses, it can be needled swiftly. One should **fold** its **victory** to disperse the stagnation. **Earth**’s stagnation can be **folded** by **Water**—this can remove its suffering.\n\nOne should needle where **Foot Jueyin** emerges and where **Foot Shaoyang** enters. Where **Foot Jueyin** emerges is the **Dadun** (**大敦**) point, located on the tip of the big toe, one **cun** from the nail like the length of a **chive leaf**, and between the three **hairs** (**三毛**). It is the **well** of **Foot Jueyin**. Needling should reach three **cun**, retaining the needle for ten breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds.\n\nWhere **Foot Shaoyang** enters is the **Yanglingquan** (**阳陵泉**) point, located one **cun** below the knee, in the depression outside the **shinbone** (**腑骨**) between the two tendons. It is the **convergence** of **Foot Shaoyang**. Needling should reach six **cun**, retaining the needle for ten breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds.\n\nWhen **Metal** seeks to descend but **Earth**’s **Tong** (**彤**, vermilion) **chamber** obstructs and suppresses it, it descends without entering, and the suppression causes stagnation and eruption. When it disperses, it can enter. If it does not descend in four days, it will descend in nine days. When it seeks to descend but stagnation disperses, it can be needled swiftly. One should **fold** its **victory** to disperse the stagnation. **Metal**’s stagnation can be **folded** by **Fire**—this can remove it.\n\nOne should needle where **Heart Envelope** (**心包胳**) emerges and where **Hand Shaoyang** enters. Where **Heart Envelope** emerges is the **Zhongchong** (**中冲**) point, located on the tip of the middle finger, one **cun** from the nail like the length of a **chive leaf**. It is the **well** of **Hand Heart Envelope**. Needling should reach one **cun**, retaining the needle for two breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds.\n\nWhere **Hand Shaoyang** enters is the **Tianjing** (**天井**) point, located one **cun** behind the outer elbow bone, in the depression between the two tendons when the elbow is flexed. It is the **convergence** of **Hand Shaoyang**. Needling should reach one **cun**, retaining the needle for ten breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds.\n\nWhen **Water** seeks to descend but **Earth**’s **Fu** (**阜**, mound) **chamber** obstructs and suppresses it, it descends without entering, and the suppression causes stagnation and eruption. When it disperses, it can enter. If it does not descend in one day, it will descend in six days. When it seeks to descend but stagnation disperses, it can be needled first. One should **fold** its **victory** (i.e., its dominant element, **Earth**) to disperse the stagnation. **Folding** its **victory** can disperse it. One should needle where **Foot Taiyin** emerges and where **Foot Yangming** enters.\n\nWhere **Foot Taiyin** emerges is the **Yinbai** (**隐白**) point, located on the tip of the big toe, one **cun** from the nail like the length of a **chive leaf**. It is the **well** of **Foot Taiyin**. Needling should reach one **cun**, retaining the needle for three breaths, then withdrawing as the **qi** is obtained.\n\nWhere **Foot Yangming** enters is the **Sanli** (**三里**) point, located three **cun** below the knee, in the depression outside the **shinbone** (**腑骨**) between the two tendons. It is the **convergence** of **Foot Yangming**. Needling should reach five **cun**, retaining the needle for ten breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** is raised to its peak.\n\nThe **Emperor** asked: *\"When the Five **Phases** (**运**) arrive, there are sequences of advance and retreat, ascent and descent, and instances where one is suppressed by another. Can I learn the method of needling based on these **transformations**?\"*\n\n**Qibo** replied: *\"One should take its **source of transformation** (**化源**). Therefore, when there is **excess**, one takes from it; when there is **deficiency**, one supplements it. When there is **excess**, one takes from it first, then **folds** its stagnation, taking its **source of transformation** to **fold** the stagnant **qi**. When there is **deficiency**, one supplements and supports it, to support the **running/flowing** **qi** and to avoid **void pathogens** (**虚邪**).\"*\n\nWhen there is **deficiency**, one must **supplement** its **source of transformation** (**化源**) to **compensate** for what is lacking, ensuring that the **running/flowing qi** (**气**) does not become **overbearing** (**不胜**).\n\nThe method of **supplementing and taking** (**资取**) is outlined in *The Secret Discourse* (**《密语》**). The **procedure** for **supplementing and taking the source of transformation** (**资取化源法方**) is detailed in the first volume of *The Mysterious Pearl: Secret Discourse* (**《玄珠密语》**).\n\n---\n\n**The Emperor** asked: *\"When the **ascending and descending** needling (**升降之刺**) is understood to grasp its **essence**, I wish to hear of the **Celestial Sovereign** (**司天**) failing to **transmit its rectitude** (**未得迁正**), causing the **Celestial Officer** (**司化**) to lose its **ordinary governance** (**失其常政**), then the **mechanism of all transformations** (**万化之机**) becomes disordered, afflicting the people with disease. May I learn how to **prevent** this and **save the masses** (**欲济群生**)?\"*\n\n**Qibo** bowed twice in respect and replied: *\"Your inquiry is profound indeed! You speak of **ultimate truths** (**至理**), and your **sage’s compassion** (**圣念慈悯**) seeks to **save the masses** (**欲济群生**). I shall now **fully expound** this **Dao/Way** (**斯道**), so that its **deep and subtle mysteries** (**洞微**) may be **revealed** (**申**, *display*) and **explored** (**洞**, *profound*) to their **wondrous depths** (**微**, *subtle*).\"*\n\n---\n\nWhen **Taiyang** (**太阳**) **repeats its deployment** (**复布**), **Jueyin** (**厥阴**) fails to **transmit its rectitude** (**不迁正**).\nThis means the **Celestial Phase** (**天运**) is **disordered**, and the **Four Seasons** (**四序**) fail to align, resulting in **epidemics** (**疫**).\n\nIf **Jueyin** does not **transmit its rectitude**, the **qi** becomes **congested above** (**气塞於上**), and one must **drain** (**写**) the **pathway of the Foot Jueyin** (**足厥阴之所流**).\nThe **qi** must be **dispersed** (**气舒**) before it is **congested again** (**复塞**), hence the need to **drain** it.\n\nThe **pathway of the Foot Jueyin** (**足厥阴之所流**) is the **Rongguan** (**荣官**) point, located between the **big toe** (**大趾**) and the **second toe** (**次指**), where the **pulsating artery** (**动脉**) yields to pressure. One should needle to a depth of **six-tenths of the body’s inch** (**身寸之六分**), retain the needle for **seven breaths** (**七呼**), and withdraw it **swiftly** as the **qi** arrives.\n\n---\n\nWhen **Jueyin** **repeats its deployment** (**复布**), **Shaoyin** (**少阴**) fails to **transmit its rectitude** (**不迁正**).\nThis means the **Celestial Phase** (**天**) has **lost its proper timing** (**失时令**), and thus the **qi’s timing** (**气令**) is **disordered** (**不正**).\n\nIf **Shaoyin** does not **transmit its rectitude**, the **qi** again **congests above** (**气塞於上**).\nAs **heat** (**热**) seeks to **transform** (**化**), **wind** (**风**) **repeats its deployment externally** (**布外**).\nOne must then needle the **pathway of the Heart Envelope’s Inner Arm** (**心包胳脉之所流**).\n\nThe **pathway of the Heart Envelope’s Inner Arm** (**心包胳脉之所流**) is the **Laoguan** (**劳官**) point, located at the **center of the palm** (**掌中央**).\nOne should needle to a depth of **three-tenths of the body’s inch** (**身寸之三分**), retain the needle for **six breaths** (**六呼**), and withdraw it **swiftly** as the **qi** arrives.\n\n---\n\nWhen **Shaoyin** **repeats its deployment** (**复布**), **Taiyin** (**太阴**) fails to **transmit its rectitude** (**不迁正**).\nThe **Celestial Phase** (**天数**) of **zi-wu** (**子午**) has **excess**, and **chou-wei** (**丑未**) cannot **achieve rectitude** (**不得中正**).\n\nIf **Taiyin** does not **transmit its rectitude**, the **qi** **lingers above** (**气留於上**).\nAs **rain** (**雨**) seeks to **transform** (**化**), **heat** (**热**) **repeats its deployment in the sky** (**布於天**).\nOne must then needle the **pathway of the Foot Taiyin** (**足太阴之所流**).\n\nThe **pathway of the Foot Taiyin** (**足太阴之所流**) is the **Dadu** (**大都**) point, located behind the **root joint of the big toe** (**大趾本节**), where the **artery yields to pressure** (**陷者**), and it is the **Rong** (**荣**) of the **Foot Taiyin** (**足太阴脉**).\nOne should needle to a depth of **three-tenths of the body’s inch** (**身寸之三分**), retain the needle for **seven breaths** (**七呼**), and withdraw it as the **qi** arrives.\n\n---\n\nWhen **Taiyin** **repeats its deployment** (**复布**), **Shaoyang** (**少阳**) fails to **transmit its rectitude** (**不迁正**).\nThe **Celestial Phase** (**天数**) of **chou-wei** (**丑未**) has **excess**, and **yin-shen** (**寅申**) cannot **achieve rectitude** (**未得中正**).\n\nIf **Shaoyang** does not **transmit its rectitude**, the **qi** **congests and does not flow** (**气塞未通**).\nAs **heat** (**热**) seeks to **transform** (**化**), **rain** (**雨**) **repeats its deployment in the sky** (**复布天**).\nOne must then needle the **pathway of the Hand Shaoyang** (**手少阳之所流**).\n\nThe **pathway of the Hand Shaoyang** (**手少阳之所流**) is the **Yemen** (**液门**) point, located between the **second and third fingers** (**小指次指**), where the **artery yields to pressure** (**陷者**), and it is the **Rong** (**荣**) of the **Hand Shaoyang** (**手少阳之荣**).\nOne should needle to a depth of **two-tenths of the body’s inch** (**身寸之二分**), retain the needle for **three breaths** (**三呼**), and withdraw it **swiftly** as the **qi** arrives.\n\n---\n\nWhen **Shaoyang** **repeats its deployment** (**复布**), **Yangming** (**阳明**) fails to **transmit its rectitude** (**不迁正**).\nThe **Celestial Phase** (**天数**) of **yin-shen** (**寅申**) has **excess**, and **mao-you** (**卯酉**) cannot **take charge of the Celestial Phase** (**未得司天**).\n\nIf **Yangming** does not **transmit its rectitude**, the **qi** **does not flow upward** (**气未通上**).\nAs **dryness** (**燥**) seeks to **govern the sky** (**治天**), **heat** (**热**) **repeats its deployment** (**复治**).\nOne must then needle the **pathway of the Hand Taiyin** (**手太阴之所流**).\n\nThe **pathway of the Hand Taiyin** (**手太阴之所流**) is the **Yuji** (**鱼际**) point, located on the **inner side** (**内侧**) of the **base joint of the thumb** (**大指本节**), where the **dispersed pulse** (**散脉**) is marked. It is the **Rong** (**荣**) of the **Hand Taiyin** (**手太阴之荣**).\nOne should needle to a depth of **two-tenths of the body’s inch** (**身寸之二分**), retain the needle for **three breaths** (**三呼**), and withdraw it **swiftly** as the **qi** arrives.\n\n---\n\nWhen **Yangming** **repeats its deployment** (**复布**), **Taiyang** (**太阳**) fails to **transmit its rectitude** (**不迁正**).\nThe **Celestial Phase** (**天数**) of **mao-you** (**卯酉**) has not yet **concluded**, and **chen-xu** (**辰戌**) cannot **take charge of rectitude** (**未得司正**).\n\nIf **Taiyang** does not **transmit its rectitude**, the **qi** **congests again** (**复塞其气**).\nAs **cold** (**寒**) seeks to **govern the sky** (**行天**), **dryness** (**燥**) **repeats its transformation** (**复化**).\nOne must then needle the **pathway of the Foot Shaoyin** (**足少阴之所流**).\n\nThe **pathway of the Foot Shaoyin** (**足少阴之所流**) is the **Rangu** (**然谷**) point, located **anterior to the medial malleolus** (**内踝前**), beneath the **prominent bone** (**大骨**), where the **artery yields to pressure** (**陷中**), and it is the **Rong** (**荣**) of the **Foot Shaoyin** (**足少阴之荣**).\nOne should needle to a depth of **three-tenths of the body’s inch** (**身寸之三分**), retain the needle for **three breaths** (**三呼**), and withdraw it as the **qi** arrives.\n\n**The Emperor** asked: *\"When **transmitting rectitude** (**迁正**) does not proceed as it should, how can one **grasp its essence** (**通其要**)? I wish to hear of **not withdrawing** (**不退**), to **fold its excess** (**折其余**), so that it does not **err** (**过失**), and may I understand this?\"*\n\n**Qibo** replied: *\"When **qi** is **in excess** (**气过**), it **repeats its deployment** (**复作布正**), which is called **not exceeding its position** (**不过位**).\nThis is known as **repeated deployment** (**布正**), where it **governs the sky twice** (**再治天**) but cannot **withdraw from its position** (**退位**).\nThus, the **Earth’s qi** (**地气**) cannot **follow its transformation** (**后化**), and the **new Celestial Sovereign** (**新司天**) cannot **transmit its rectitude** (**迁正**). Hence, the **qi** **repeats its deployment**, resembling the **Celestial Phase** of the **previous year** (**旧岁**).\n\nThe **Celestial Phase** of the **new year** (**新岁司天**) cannot **achieve rectitude** (**未得中司**), while the **Celestial Phase** of the **previous year** (**去岁司天**) continues to **govern the sky** (**治天**). Therefore, the **qi** **exceeds the Celestial Phase’s proper order** (**气过天令不常**), and this is why it **brings disaster** (**作灾**), causing disease among the people.\n\nIn the **year of *yi-hai* (**已亥**), the **Celestial Phase** (**天数**) has **excess**, so **Jueyin** (**厥阴**) does not **withdraw from its position** (**不退位**).\nBy the time of the **years of *zi-wu* (**子午**)**, it still **governs the sky** (**犹尚治天**).\nAs **wind** (**风**) **prevails above** (**行於上**), **wood** (**木**) **repeats its deployment** (**化布天**).\nThe **transformation of dampness from rain** (**雨湿之化**) is not **properly ordered** (**不令**), and the **transformation of wind** (**风化**) becomes **harsh and excessive**, resulting in **disaster** (**作灾**).\nOne must then needle the **pathway of the Foot Jueyin’s entry** (**足厥阴之所入**).\n\nThe **pathway of the Foot Jueyin’s entry** (**足厥阴之所入**) is the **Ququan** (**曲泉**) point, located **below the medial condyle of the femur** (**膝内辅骨下**), above the **large tendon** (**大筋**), and below the **small tendon** (**小筋**), where the **artery yields to pressure** (**陷者**). It is obtained by **flexing the knee** (**屈膝**), and it is the **He** (**合**) point of the **Foot Jueyin** (**足厥阴之合**).\nOne should needle to a depth of **six-tenths of the body’s inch** (**身寸之六分**), retain the needle for **seven breaths** (**七呼**), and withdraw it **swiftly** as the **qi** arrives.\n\nThe year of **Zi-Wu**, the **Heavenly Stem** is in excess, hence **Lesser Yin** does not retreat from its position.\nUntil the years of **Chou-Wei**, it still governs **Heaven**.\n**Heat** courses above, and the **residual fire** transforms and spreads across **Heaven**.\nThe **dry-clear** is deficient, the **rain transformation** is improper, and the **heat transformation** again governs **Heaven’s order**.\nOne must then needle the **entry point of the Hand Jueyin**.\n\nThe **entry point of the Hand Jueyin** is the **Quze** (**曲泽**) point, located in the depression below the inner elbow’s edge, obtained by **flexing the elbow**, the **He** (**合**) point of the **Hand Jueyin**.\nOne should needle to a depth of **three-tenths of the body’s inch** (**身寸之三分**), retain the needle for **seven breaths** (**七呼**), and withdraw it swiftly as the **qi** arrives.\n\nThe year of **Chou-Wei**, the **Heavenly Stem** is in excess, hence **Greater Yin** does not retreat from its position.\nUntil the years of **Yin-Shen**, it still governs **Heaven**.\n**Dampness** courses above, and the **rain transformation** spreads across **Heaven**.\nThe **cold transformation** is deficient, the **heat transformation** is improper, and the **damp transformation** again spreads and governs **Heaven’s order**.\nOne must then needle the **entry point of the Foot Taiyin**.\n\nThe **entry point of the Foot Taiyin** is the **Taiyin Lingquan** (**太阴陵泉**) point, located in the depression below the inner medial condyle, the **He** (**合**) point of the **Foot Taiyin**.\nOne should needle to a depth of **five-tenths of the body’s inch** (**身寸之五分**), retain the needle for **seven breaths** (**七呼**), and withdraw it swiftly as the **qi** arrives.\n\nThe year of **Yin-Shen**, the **Heavenly Stem** is in excess, hence **Lesser Yang** does not retreat from its position.\nUntil the years of **Mao-You**, it still governs **Heaven**.\n**Heat** courses above, and the **fire transformation** spreads across **Heaven**.\nThe **dry-clear** is proper but deficient, the **heat transformation** again governs, spreading and enacting **Heaven’s order**.\nOne must then needle the **entry point of the Hand Shaoyang**.\n\nThe **entry point of the Hand Shaoyang** is the **Tianjing** (**天井**) point, located behind the outer elbow bone, one **inch** above the elbow’s depression between two tendons, obtained by **flexing the elbow**, the **He** (**合**) point of the **Hand Shaoyang**.\nOne should needle to a depth of **three-tenths of the body’s inch** (**身寸之三分**), and withdraw it swiftly as the **qi** arrives.\n\nThe year of **Mao-You**, the **Heavenly Stem** is in excess, hence **Yangming** does not retreat from its position.\nUntil the years of **Chen-Xu**, it still governs **Heaven**.\n**[Missing term]** courses above, and the **dry transformation** spreads across **Heaven**.\nThe **wind transformation** is deficient, and the **cold transformation** is improper, while the **clear transformation** again governs, spreading and enacting **Heaven’s order**.\nOne must then needle the **entry point of the Hand Taiyin**.\n\nThe **entry point of the Hand Taiyin** is the **Cheze** (**尺泽**) point, located at the transverse cubital crease where the pulse responds to pressure, the **He** (**合**) point of the **Hand Taiyin**.\nOne should needle to a depth of **three inches** (**三寸**), retain the needle for **three breaths** (**三呼**), and withdraw it swiftly as the **qi** arrives.\n\nThe year of **Chen-Xu**, the **Heavenly Stem** is in excess, hence **Taiyang** does not retreat from its position.\nUntil the years of **Si-Hai**, it still governs **Heaven**.\n**Cold** courses above, and the **rigid water transformation** spreads across **Heaven**.\nThe **heat transformation** is improper, the **wind transformation** is improper, and the **cold transformation** again governs, enacting **Heaven’s order**.\nOne must then needle the **entry point of the Foot Shaoyin**.\n\nThe **entry point of the Foot Shaoyin** is the **Yinggu** (**阴谷**) point, located below the knee, behind the inner medial condyle, beneath the large tendon and above the outer tendon, where pressure yields, obtained by **flexing the knee**, the **He** (**合**) point of the **Foot Shaoyin**.\nOne should needle to a depth of **four-tenths of the body’s inch** (**身寸之四分**), and withdraw it as the **qi** arrives.\n\nThus, when the **qi** of **Heaven and Earth** is disordered, transformations manifest as diseases among the people. By applying the method of needling, one may **preventively** restore balance.\nHuman **qi** communicates with **Heaven and Earth**.\nWhen **qi** exchanges and shifts, the **excess and retreat** of **Heaven’s elements** can be **harmonized**.\n\nNeedle the **source of excess**, and the beginning and end may be balanced.\nThe **Yellow Emperor** asked:\n*\"When the two **Stems of Just and Gentle** lose their positions, does this make the **Heavenly cycles’ qi** all **vacant**? Can the diseases among the people be balanced?\"*\nIf the **Heavenly cycles** are vacant, they may be corrected by needling and removed.\n\n**Qibo** replied:\n*\"Profound is your question.\nClarify its deepest meaning—when **Heaven and Earth** alternate shifts, a **three-year epidemic** arises, called the **visible root**. There must be an **escape path**.\nThis is called **investigating the roots of Heaven and Earth’s calamities**, seeking the **distant gates of survival and escape**.\n\nSuppose **Jia-Zi**—when **Just and Gentle** lose their positions.\nThe **Gentle** obtains its position, but **Just** is lost above. Though they exchange governance, the **cycle** has not yet arrived.\n**Jia-Zi** has not yet completed its governance, and though **Ji-Mao** below shifts to correctness, this is called the **Gentle Stem** being **lonely and vacant** below.\n**Just** is not corrected, **Ji** does not align with **Jia**, and thus the **Earth cycle** reverses to vacancy while **Wood** prevails.\n**Just** is not corrected, the **Gentle** is lonely and deficient.\n**Jia** does not align with **Ji**.\nThe **Earth cycle** is improper, its correctness is lost, **Lesser Yin** does not transform, hence **Heaven and Earth** are both vacant, allowing **evil transformations** to cause epidemics.\nWhen the **sequence of time** is improper, the **musical notes** do not follow.\nThough **Heaven’s governance** is still spread, the **central cycle** has a prevailing influence.\n\nWhen **Jia-Wei** approaches but **Ji-Yi** arrives, the **notes** lack sound while the **Lü** has resonance—this is when the **Yellow Bell** and **Major Official** do not respond to the **Minor Official**, and the **tablet** must be used. **Ji-Mao** below holds the **lonely position of Earth governance**.\n\nThus, over three years, a great epidemic arises.\nIf severe, it arrives swiftly, spanning **three years** from beginning to end.\nExamine its **subtlety and severity**, observe its **shallowness and depth**.\nWhen **vacancy** spreads and governance lasts long, it is **deep**—**deep** is **severe**.\nWhen the **cycle** is not corrected, the **prevailing influence** lasts long—**deep** and **severe**.\nThis spans **two years** from beginning to end.\n\nIf the epidemic is about to arrive and may be needled, needle it.\nThis is to clarify the **needling method**—those who govern **before correction** may be needled for their **immediate disorders**.\nOnly those who know may say: Within three years, a great epidemic will arrive. Needle to **supplement the withered** and bring **auspiciousness**—this is to **diligently examine** its **subtlety and severity**, knowing where it will reach, and **preventively harmonize** it.\n\nFirst, **supplement the Shenshu**.\nWhen the **Earth epidemic** arrives and the **kidneys are vacant**, first supplement the **Shenshu**, located below the **fourteenth vertebra**, one **inch and five-tenths** (**一寸五分**) on either side.\nBefore needling, warm the **street needle** in the mouth, use a **round, sharp needle**.\nAt the moment of needling, chant:\n*\"Five Emperors of Supreme Truth,\nSix Jia of Mystic Spirit,\nQi符至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴至阴\n\nRecite three times, then remove the needle from the mouth. First, insert the needle two *fen*, retain it for six breaths, then advance to three *fen*. When *qi* arrives, slowly withdraw the needle, pressing with the hand. Have the recipient swallow *qi* three times, thereby stabilizing their spirit and soul.\n\nThree days later, needle the point where **Foot Taiyin** converges—**Dàibái** (大白穴). This lies in the depression below the medial malleolus, where **Foot Taiyin**’s vessels converge. First, warm the needle by holding it in the mouth. Just before insertion, chant:\n*\"Emperor Supports the Celestial Form,\nProtects Life as Spirit Manifests.\"*\n\nRecite this three times, then insert to three *fen*, retain for seven breaths. When *qi* arrives, swiftly withdraw the needle.\n\nIf the **Jǐ-Mǎo** (己卯) position is absent, leaving **Jia-Zǐ** (甲子) isolated, then in the third year, an **Earth pestilence** will arise. The method of supplementation and drainage follows the same principle as when **Jia-Zǐ** aligns.\n\nThus, **Jia-Zǐ, Jia-Xū, Jia-Shēn, Jia-Wǔ, Jia-Chén, Jia-Yín**, as well as **Jǐ-Chǒu, Jǐ-Hài, Jǐ-Yǒu, Jǐ-Wèi, Jǐ-Sì, Jǐ-Mǎo**—whenever **Jia** and **Jǐ** lose their proper positions above or below—all follow this single method.\n\nOnce the needling is complete, avoid night travel or long journeys. Observe seven days of purity, abstaining from disputes and maintaining strict fasting and ritual discipline.\n\nFor those with long-standing kidney ailments, at the **Yín hour**, face south, maintain a calm mind without distraction, and hold the breath without exhaling for seven cycles. Draw the neck upward, swallowing *qi* smoothly, as if swallowing a hard object. Repeat this seven times, then consume the saliva beneath the tongue in abundance.\n\nThe Daoist practice of swallowing *qi* strengthens the roots and secures the foundation, allowing the **Child** to receive the **Mother’s** *qi*.\n\nWhen swallowing *qi*, let the abdomen resonate, until the *qi* at the navel reveals the **Mother’s Original Essence**. This is called **\"Returning to the Root, Restoring the Original.\"**\n\nProlonged practice deepens the roots and nourishes the foundation.\n\nThus, swallowing *qi* and saliva is called **\"Heavenly Pool Water.\"** It may be consumed repeatedly to nourish *jing*, *qi*, and blood, purifying the five *zàng* organs. It first irrigates the **Original Sea**—also called **\"The Ministry of Separation’s Water,\" \"Jade Pool,\" or \"Divine Water\"**—and must never be spat out. Only consumption is permitted, to supplement *jing* and blood, benefiting the **Original Sea**.\n\nIf, for instance, **Bǐng-Yín** (丙寅) is unbalanced, with **yín** occupying its position while **yáng** is lost above.\n\n「Though it may secure its **intercalary year** (*jiāo suì* 交歲), yet **Bǐng-Yín** (丙寅) has not yet shifted to its rightful position to govern the **Heavenly Mandate** (*zhì tiān xià* 治天下), while **Xīn-Wèi** (辛巳) alone governs its **Spring and Autumn Well** (*qǔ* 泉). The **Heavenly Stem** (*tiān gān* 天干) **Bǐng** (丙) loses its **‘just yang’** (*gāng gàn* 剛幹) above, so the **central water** (*zhōng shuǐ* 中水) phase cannot be secured—its influence is excessive, and it is countered by **Earth’s victory** (*tǔ shèng* 土勝).\n\nWhen the **‘just yang’** (*gāng gàn* 剛幹) loses its place, the **‘yielding yin’** (*róu* 柔) cannot stand alone below. The **yielding yin** (*róu gàn* 柔幹) in the upper position is already insufficient—how much more so when the **yielding yin** loses its **just yang** (丙失其剛)!\n\nIf the **central water** (*zhōng shuǐ* 中水) phase is not excessive, one must not rigidly apply the law to determine it. The excess is not to be found in all **Bǐng** (丙) years; rather, it should be examined through **celestial calculations** (*tiān shù* 天數) to recognize its **deficiency** (*qū* 亏).\n\n**Earth’s victory** (*tǔ shèng* 土勝) is in excess, yet the **Heavenly Stem** (*tiān gān* 天干) **Bǐng** (丙) loses its rightful position above. Though **Heaven** (*tiān* 天) presides over governance, this is the transformation of **Earth’s victory** (*tǔ zhèng* 布正), where **Bǐng** (丙) governs the year but has not attained its proper place. When **Heaven** and **Earth** do not harmonize, the **Lü** (吕) and **Yue** (律) tones diverge.\n\nThe **yielding yin** (*róu gàn* 柔幹) arrives, and the **Lü** (吕) tone has a corresponding resonance, yet the **‘just yang’** (*gāng gàn* 剛幹) has not yet shifted, and the **Yue** (律) pipes emit no sound—this is akin to the **minor羽** (*shǎo yǔ* 少羽) producing a **murmur** (*mǎ xiǎng* 呵響), while the **major羽** (*dà yǔ* 大羽) remains **silent** (*kǒu□#8* 口□#8). Thus, the **celestial order** (*tiān yùn* 天運) is disrupted.\n\nThough there may be transformations, they are not the **constant transformations** (*cháng huà* 常化).」\n\nAfter three years, the epidemic shifts. Its severity varies—some mild, some extreme—so the timing differs, depending on the depth of the **Heavenly calculations** (*tiān shù* 天數). Examining its mild or extreme nature reveals discrepancies of varying degrees. A major discrepancy (*dà chā* 大差) spans seven *fèn* 分, a minor one (*xiǎo chā* 小差) five *fèn*. Each *fèn* corresponds to fifteen days. A major discrepancy arrives swiftly, while a minor one comes gradually.\n\nA gradual arrival means the epidemic shifts after three years; an extreme arrival means it strikes in the first three years. By calculating the discrepancies and their speed, one knows the **celestial order** (*tiān yùn* 天運) is delayed. One must first **supplement the Heart Shu** (*xīn yǔ* 心俞). The **Heart Shu** is located below the fifth vertebra on the back, one and a half *cùn*寸 from either side. Use a **round, sharp needle** (*yuán lì zhēn* 圓利針), warmed in the mouth at midday. Next, press the point with the hand until the **qi** (*qì* 氣) moves, then recite the incantation three times:\n*\"Tàishǐ Shàngqīng* (太始上清), *Dān Yuán Shǒu Líng* (丹元守靈).\nFirst visualize firelight at the point below, then insert the needle to a depth of one *cùn* to one and a half *cùn* of the patient’s body, retaining it for seven breaths. When the **qi** arrives, advance the needle three *fèn* 分. Tap the needle with the hand to guide the **qi** downward before insertion, then withdraw it slowly once the **qi** moves. Next, palpate the point while the patient holds their breath for three inhalations and swallows.\n\nOn the fifth day, needle the **Kidney’s entry point** (*shèn zhī suǒ rù* 腎之所入), the **Yin Valley** (*yīn gǔ* 陰谷) point, located behind the medial condyle of the femur, beneath the large tendon and above the small one. Pressing it should yield a response; it is found when the knee is flexed. Use a **round, sharp needle**, warmed in the mouth. Press the point first, then recite:\n*\"Dà Wēi Dìjūn* (大微帝君), *wǔ qì jí zhēn* (五氣及真), *liù xīn dōu sī* (六辛都司), *fú fú hēi yún* (符扶黑雲).\nRecite once, then insert the needle to a depth of four *fèn* of the patient’s body *cùn*, withdrawing it quickly once the **qi** moves.\n\nAdditionally, for **lower positions of Earth** (*xià wèi dì jiǎzǐ* 下位地甲子), such as **Sin-Yi** (*xīn yǐ* 辛巳) where **yielding yin** (*róu* 柔) does not align with **just yang** (*gāng* 剛), it is also called **losing its proper place** (*shī gǔ* 失守). This means the **Earthly order** (*dì yùn* 地運) is entirely **empty** (*xū* 虚), and after three years, the epidemic shifts to **water pestilence** (*shuǐ lì* 水疠). The needling methods are the same.\n\nFor example, in **Geng-Chen** (*gēng chén* 庚辰), where **just yang** (*gāng* 剛) and **yielding yin** (*róu* 柔) lose their proper alignment, **Yi** (乙) holds its position, while **Geng** (庚) loses its place above—this is called **yielding yin losing its proper alignment with just yang** (*róu shī qí gāng* 柔失其剛). Though **Yi** holds the year, **Geng** does not occupy the central position, while **Yi** holds the lower position. **Earth’s governance** (*dì zhì* 地治) is thus disrupted. The upper position of **Geng** loses its **just yang** (*gāng gàn* 剛幹), so the **central metal order** (*zhōng jīn yùn* 中金運) does not overreach; instead, it suffers **fire’s victory** (*huǒ shèng* 火勝). When the upper position loses its alignment, the lower position lacks harmony. **Yi-Wei** (乙未) governs the lower position in isolation, lacking the upper **just yang**’s alignment. Thus, the **celestial order** is empty. **Yi-Geng** (乙庚) represents the **metal order** (*jīn yùn* 金運), which does not correspond to mutual attraction. When upper and lower positions attract each other, **yin** and **yang** harmonize.\n\nThe **Heavenly governance** (*sī tiān* 司天) and **Earthly order** (*yùn* 運) each attain their transformations. **Earth’s victory** (*tǔ zhèng* 布正) has not yet retreated, while the **central order** (*zhōng yùn* 中運) arrives in victory. Since the **original yang year** (*yáng nián yuán shèng* 陽年元勝) does not repeat, the **supporting stems and branches** (*zhī gàn* 支幹) lack alignment. When upper and lower positions misalign, it is called **losing its proper place** (*shī gǔ* 失守). **Geng** (庚) does not align with **Yi** (乙). The **Gu-Xi** (姑洗) and **Lin-Zhong** (林鍾) pipes fail to resonate with **Shang** (商) tones. **Losing its proper place** means the same tones do not harmonize: **Gu-Xi**, the upper pipe for **Geng-Chen** (庚辰), does not resonate with the **great Shang** (太商); **Lin-Zhong**, the lower pipe for **Yi-Wei** (乙未), resonates only with the **minor Shang** (少商).\n\nThus, the **transformations of the celestial order** (*tiān yùn huà* 天運化) shift.\n\nThus, the **Four Seasons** (*sì xù* 四序) are not in harmony.\n\nThree years bring about a **great epidemic** (*dà yì* 大疫). The **Metal Epidemic** (*jīn yì* 金疫), also called the **Killing Epidemic** (*shā yì* 杀疫), varies in severity according to its **celestial order** (*tiān shù* 天数). When the **great disparity** (*dà chà* 大差) reaches seven **fen** (分), the **qi** (*qì* 气) lingers beyond **one hundred and fifty days** (*yī bǎi wǔ rì* 一百五日), it is then at its **most severe** (*shèn* 甚). When the **small disparity** (*xiǎo chà* 小差) reaches five **fen**, the **qi** lingers beyond **seventy-five days** (*qī shí wǔ rì* 七十五日), it is then **less severe** (*wēi* 微). **Less severe** (*wēi*) means gradual, appearing over three years. **Most severe** (*shèn*) means swift, appearing within three years.\n\nWhen the **celestial order** (*tiān yùn* 天运) is **losing its proper place** (*shī gǔ* 失守) in the **Gu-Xi** (姑洗) and **Lin-Zhong** (林钟) pipes, as in the case of **Yi-Wei** (乙未) and **Geng-Chen** (庚辰), the **Metal Epidemic** (*jīn yì*) arises, also named the **Killing Epidemic** (*shā yì*). Its arrival depends on the **earthly order** (*dì shù* 地数) and the **disparity** (*chà* 差) of the **celestial order**. One must also calculate its **gradual or swift** (*wēi shèn* 微甚) nature. If it arrives swiftly, it will manifest within three years; if delayed, it will appear after three years. Its coming is akin to that of the **Metal Epidemic** (*jīn yì*), and the acupuncture method is the same as before.\n\nIn all cases where **Yi** (乙) and **Geng** (庚) **lose their proper place** (*shī gǔ*), the acupuncture method remains identical. This is because, though the **transformations of the celestial order** (*tiān yùn huà* 天运化) differ, the **Metal Killing Epidemic** (*jīn shā yì* 金杀疫) and the **people’s diseases** (*mín bìng* 民病) are the same in nature. The treatment must be applied accordingly to **ward off** (*què* 却) the illness.\n\nTo **calm the Liver** (*chéng yù* 肝欲平), one must avoid **anger** (*nù* 怒). If anger arises, the **yin** (*yīn* 阴) will manifest, and since the Liver governs the **intestinal spirit** (*cháng shén* 肠神), the **yin** will disrupt the **yang** (*yáng* 陽) and **arcane spirit** (*yāo* 夭). At night, one should **soothe the mind** (*ān qì zhī yì* 安其志), avoiding recitation of **harsh words** (*è yǔ* 恶语), so that the **yang spirit** (*yáng shén* 陽神) and **arcane spirit** (*yāo* 夭) may remain in the **center** (*zhōng* 中).\n\nFor instance, in the case of **Renshen** (壬申) where **yang-yin** (*gāng róu* 剛柔) **lose their proper place** (*shī gǔ*), the lower **celestial order** (*xià* 下) aligns with its **proper place** (*wèi* 位), while the upper **celestial order** (*shàng* 上) **loses its proper place** (*shī gǔ*). Thus, the **celestial order** (*sī tiān* 司天) aligns with **orthodoxity** (*bù zhèng* 布正), while the **Wood Season** (*mù yùn* 木运) **lacks its proper support** (*fǎn xū* 反虚). Though the years intersect, the **celestial order** (*tiān* 天) has not yet **shifted to its proper place** (*yí zhèng* 迁正), the **supporting season** (*zhōng yùn* 中运) will manifest in the **earthly order** (*dì* 地) at **Ding-You** (丁酉), **solely governing** (*dú zhǔ qí yùn* 独主其运) the **season**. Thus, its **dryness** (*zào* 燥) **prevails over** (*shèng* 胜) the **celestial order** before the **heat transformation** (*rè huà* 热化) occurs; this is called the **double lack** (*èr xū* 二虚).\n\nIf the upper **celestial order** (*shàng* 上) **Renshen** (壬申) **shifts to its proper place** (*yí zhèng*), and the lower **celestial order** (*xià* 下) **Ding** (丁) **stands alone** (*dú rán* 独然), then even though it is a **yang year** (*yáng nián* 陽年), the **disparity** (*kuī* 亏) and **alignment** (*jí* 及) will differ. The **epidemic** (*zāi* 灾) will follow suit.\n\nWithin three days, the Liver will **manifest disease** (*zì bìng* 自病), and the **Wind Transformation** (*fēng huà* 风化) will not be permitted. The **season** (*yùn* 运) will **lose its proper place** (*shī* 失) with **Renshen** (壬申), and **Yi-Wei** (乙未) will not obtain its **proper place**. If the **celestial order** (*tiān* 天) **aligns with its proper place** (*fù wèi* 复位), it will **shift to its proper place** (*yí zhèng* 迁正) without delay, and the **angle** (*jiǎo* 角) will not **misalign** (*bù jiǎ* 不假).\n\nWhen the upper and lower **celestial orders** **lose their proper place** (*shī gǔ*), they **reciprocally call forth** (*xiāng zhāo* 相招) in a set **period** (*qī* 期). Calculating this through **celestial divisions** (*tiān bié* 天别) and **fen** (分), if the **celestial order** (*tiān* 天) **returns to its proper place** (*fù wèi*), it will **reciprocally call forth** (*dé xiāng zhāo* 得相招). The **gradual or swift** (*wēi shèn*) nature of the **disparity** (*chà* 差) has its own **fixed numbers** (*qí shù* 其数). A **disparity** of seven **fen** means a **period** of one hundred and fifty days, the **great disparity** (*dà chà* 大差). A **disparity** of five **fen** means seventy-five days, and the **lower disparity** (*qí xià* 其下) is even more **gradual**.\n\nThe **Lü** (律) and **Lǘ** (吕) pipes, the **two angles** (*èr jiǎo* 二角), **lose their resonance** (*shī* 失) and do not harmonize. Though they share the same **tone** (*yīn* 音), their **resonance** (*yìng* 应) differs. The upper **Lü** (律) pipe, **Luobin** (萝宾), and the lower **Lǘ** (吕) pipe, **Nanlü** (南吕), do not resonate with the **great angle** (*dà jiǎo* 大角), but the **minor angle** (*shǎo jiǎo* 少角) does. Thus, the **two angles** **lose their resonance** (*shī yìng* 失应) and do not harmonize.\n\nOn the day when **Renshen** (壬申) **shifts to its proper place** (*yí zhèng*), the upper and lower **angles** (*jiǎo* 角) will **reciprocally call forth** (*xiāng yìng* 相应) in harmony. Their **gradual or swift** (*wēi shèn*) nature will be as observed, and within three years, a **great epidemic** (*dà yì* 大疫) will arise. If it is **gradual** (*wēi* 微), it will arrive at **Yǐ-You** (乙酉); if **swift** (*shèn* 甚), it will arrive at **Jiǎ-Shēn** (甲申). **Swift** means rapid, **gradual** means slow.\n\nOne should then **acupuncture the Spleen’s point** (*pí zhī yù* 脾之俞). The **Spleen’s point** (*pí zhī yù*) is located beneath the **eleventh vertebra** (*shí yī zhuī* 第十一椎) on the back, one and a half **cun** (寸) on either side, where the **dynamic response** (*dòng tún* 动豚) is felt under the hand. Using a **round and sharp needle** (*yuán lì zhēn* 圆利针), warmed in the mouth, one first **presses the point** (*àn xué* 按穴) with the left hand, then **recites the incantation** (*sòng zhòu* 诵咒):\n\n\"Great **origin** (*tài shǐ* 太始) and **true essence** (*shàng zhēn* 上真),\nFive **symbols** (*wǔ fú* 五符) of the **Celestial Lord** (*dì jūn* 帝君),\n**Original harmony** (*yuán hé* 元和) and **qi** (*qì*) **united** (*qì hé* 气合),\n**Celestial order** (*dì fú* 帝符) **enters its divine domain** (*sī rù qí shén* 司入其神).\n\nReciting this three times, one **acupunctures** (*zhēn* 刺) to a depth of three **cun** (分) equal to the **body’s inch** (*tóng shēn cùn* 同身寸), retains the needle for two **breaths** (*èr hū* 二呼), and withdraws it **gradually** (*xú xú* 徐徐) once the **dynamic qi** (*dòng qì* 动气) is felt. One then **presses the point** (*fú xué* 扪穴) with the hand and instructs the patient to **swallow** (*yàn jīng* 咽津) three times.\n\nOn the third day, one may **acupuncture the point where the Liver’s qi emerges** (*chéng zhī suǒ chū* 肝之所出), which is the **Great Metropolis** (*dà dūn xué* 大敦穴), located at the end of the **big toe** (*dà zǐ* 大趾), near the **nail** (*zǐ jiǎ* 爪甲) like **chive leaves** (*rú jiǔ yè* 如韭叶), and among the **three hairs** (*sān máo* 三毛), belonging to the **Jing-well** (*jǐng* 井) of the **Foot Jueyin** (*zú jié yīn* 足厥阴) **meridian**.\n\nUsing a **round and sharp needle** (*yuán lì zhēn*), warmed in the mouth, one **recites the incantation** (*sòng zhòu*):\n\n\"True **essence** (*zhēn* 真) **reaches the Mysterious** (*dá dào míng rán* 大道冥然),\nThe **Five Spirits** (*wǔ shén* 五神) each in their **proper place** (*gè wèi* 各位),\n**Qi** (*qì*) **deficit in the Three Fields** (*qì quē sān tián* 气缺三田).\n\nAfter reciting this, one may **acupuncture** (*zhēn* 刺) to a depth of three **cun** (分) equal to the **body’s inch**, retain the needle for ten **breaths** (*shí hū* 十呼), and withdraw it once the **dynamic qi** (*dòng qì*) is felt.\n\nAfter the **acupuncture** (*zhēn* 刺) is complete, one should **quiet the spirit** (*jìng shén* 静神) for seven days. Avoid **excessive drinking** (*dà zuì* 大醉), **singing and merrymaking** (*gē lè* 歌乐), as these actions will **scatter the qi** (*sàn qì* 气散). Avoid **overindulging in food** (*bǎo shí* 饱食), and do not consume **raw foods** (*shēng wù* 生物). **Singing and merrymaking** will **stir the Spleen’s spirit** (*pí shén dòng* 脾神动) and **scatter the qi**. **Excessive drinking** will **disrupt the nature** (*xìng luàn* 性乱), and **overindulging in food** will cause **food stagnation** (*shí zhǎng* 食胀), hence the caution.\n\nTo **strengthen the Spleen** (*shí pí* 脾实) and **ensure free flow of qi** (*qì wú zhì* 气无滞), one should avoid **prolonged sitting after meals** (*cháng zuò* 久坐), **excessively sour foods** (*dà suān* 大酸), and **all raw foods** (*yī qiè shēng wù* 一切生物). **Sweet and mild** (*gān yí* 甘宜) foods are preferred. **Mild** (*tán* 淡) foods **enter the stomach** (*rù wèi* 入胃) and are **beneficial to the Spleen** (*yí yì fǔ* 宜益府). **Mildness** (*tán* 淡) refers to the **Earth’s subtle flavor** (*tǔ zhī bó wèi* 土之薄味), which is **secondary to sweetness** (*èr cì yú gān* 而又次於甘).\n\n---\n\n**On Nurturing the Spleen and the Five Epidemics**\n\nDo not sit idly, nor remain outdoors for long—this is how one nurtures the Spleen.\n\nIf, moreover, the **Earthly Branch** *jiǎzǐ* (甲子) lies beneath the earth, or if **Ding-Yǒu** (丁酉) loses its proper position, failing to secure the **Central Authority** (*zhōng sī* 中司), then the **qi** will not occupy its rightful place. If **Ding** (丁) does not align with **Rén** (壬) in mutual support, this is also called **losing its position** (*shī shǒu* 失守), not **harmonious virtue** (*hé dé* 合德). Thus, the yielding fails to adhere to the firm.\n\nWhen the **Heavenly and Earthly Branches** *jiǎzǐ* (二甲子) do not mutually correspond above and below, **Yin and Yang** become disordered, and thus the **Central Cycle** loses its regular governance of the **Yearly Harmonies** (*suì hé* 岁合之常政). If the **Earthly Cycle** fails to align, **three years of plague** (*biàn lì* 变疠) ensue. This is called **Wood Epidemic** (*mù yì* 名木疠) or **Wind Epidemic** (*fēng lì* 风疠). When it arrives, its severity can be inferred from its subtle signs. The method of acupuncture follows that of **Wood Plague** (*mù yì* 木疫). For all cases where **Ding and Rén** lose their positions above and below, the same method is applied.\n\nFor instance, if **Wu-Shēn** (戊申) loses its firm-yielding alignment—**Wu** (戊) should harmonize with **Guǐ** (癸)—then the **Heavenly and Earthly Branches** *jiǎzǐ* (二甲子) would ideally align **Wu-Shēn** (戊申) with **Guǐ-Hài** (癸亥). If **Guǐ-Hài** (癸亥) descends to Earth, it governs the **Earthly Authority** (*dì zhèng sī* 地正司). However, **Wu-Shēn** (戊申) exceeds **Ding-Wèi** (丁未), and since **Heaven’s count** (*tiān shù* 天数) has not yet retreated but instead spreads anew, it **loses its position** (*shī shǒu*). Thus, **Wu and Guǐ** do not harmonize. Though **Wu-Guǐ** (戊癸) belong to the **Fire Cycle** (*huǒ yùn* 火运), the **Yang Year** does not become excessive. **Wu-Wèi** (戊未) governs its proper authority, while **Guǐ** (癸) governs alone below, so it is not excessive—rather, it suffers **Water’s dominance** (*shòu shuǐ shèng* 受水胜). The **Heavenly Branch** loses its firmness, and the yielding **qi** becomes ungoverned, giving rise to **pathogenic intrusion** (*xié gàn* 邪干). If **Water Cycle** loses its position above, the **Middle and Lower Cycles** suffer deficiency, so **Heaven becomes void** (*tiān xū* 天虚) while **Earth still governs**. When the **Fire Cycle** appears in the Middle, **Water** invades it, hence the term **pathogenic intrusion**. The shifts in position vary in depth, and if **Heaven’s count** (*tiān shù*) exceeds its due measure, the imbalance may be slight or great. Yet if they eventually align in mutual support, the harmony depends on the **lunar count** (*yuè shù* 月数). When they are about to harmonize, their **musical tones** (*yīn lǜ* 音律) first resonate in unison—a sign of the **Fire Cycle’s** advance. The **Heavenly and Earthly musical scales** (*èr lǜ lǘ* 上下律吕) exhaust the **Great and Lesser Overtures** (*tài shǎo èr zhēng* 太少二征), and their harmonized tones converge. Thus, when **Heaven’s Cycle** is untimely, within three years, the **Fire Epidemic** (*huǒ yì* 火疫) arrives. It may come swiftly by **Gēng-Xū** (庚戌) or gradually by **Xīn-Hài** (辛亥). One must then **acupunct the Lung’s Back-Shu point** (*fèi shù* 肺俞).\n\nThe **Lung’s Back-Shu point** (*fèi shù*) lies below the **third vertebra** (*dì sān zhuī* 第三椎), one and a half *cùn* on either side, where the pulse responds to pressure. Use a **sharp, round needle**, warmed in the mouth. First, press the point with the hand, then insert the needle to a depth of **two *fēn*** (*èr fēn* 二分). Recite the incantation three times:\n\n*\"True and False Qi contend in struggle,\nQi infuses the Original Spirit,\nThe Imperial Symbol returns to its root,\nPositions align with their kin.\"*\n\nWhen the **qi** is about to arrive, visualize **white radiance** (*bái xī* 白熙) beneath the point. Insert another *fēn*, then withdraw the needle slowly as the **qi** arrives, pressing the point with the hand. The ailment may then be cured immediately. After acupuncture, maintain **mental tranquility for seven days**, avoiding **excessive grief**. Grief agitates the Lung, causing the **True Qi** to disperse once more.\n\nIn all things—**joy, anger, sorrow, delight, and fear**—one must not overindulge. These five emotions can **disturb Heaven** and **scatter the Original Spirit** (*luàn zhēn shén* 乱真神). Thus, the Sage **abandons idle thoughts** and **stills the mind**, preserving the Spirit. When the Spirit governs the form, the form remains whole, ensuring **bodily ease** and **eternal Dao**.\n\nTo **strengthen the Lung** (*shí fèi* 肺实), one must **regulate the breath** (*xī qì* 息气). Avoid **heavy panting**, excessive speech, or **prolonged breathing**. Do not speak or breathe too much, nor consume **salty, cold foods** (*xián shí* 咸食) in excess. **Grief, anger, and sorrow** are especially forbidden, as they **injure the Lung’s Spirit** (*shāng fèi shén* 伤肺神).\n\nIf, moreover, the **Earthly Branch** *jiǎzǐ* (甲子) lies beneath, and **Guǐ-Hài** (癸亥) loses its position, this is when the **yielding loses its place** (*róu shī shǒu wèi* 柔失守位), and the **Heavenly Branch** loses its firmness (*shàng shī qí gāng* 上失其刚). This is also called **\"Wu and Guǐ failing to harmonize in virtue\"** (*wù guǐ bù xiāng hé dé* 戊癸不相合德). When the **Cycle aligns with the void Earth**, three years later, **Fire Plague** (*huǒ lì* 火疠) emerges—akin to **Fire Epidemic** (*huǒ yì*). The treatment follows the same method. For all cases involving **Wu** (戊) and **Guǐ** (癸) losing their positions above and below, the approach is identical.\n\nThus, when the **Earthly Cycle** is established for five years, one must discern **losing its position** and apply the **Wetness Method** (*shī fǎ* 湿法) in acupuncture. **Epidemic** (*yì*) and **Plague** (*lì*) refer to the **disorder of firm-yielding above and below**, ultimately converging into one principle.\n\nThe **acupuncture method for Epidemics** consists of **five techniques**, summarizing all cases of **positional loss**, thus unifying them under the **Five Phases**. These are the **Five Epidemics and Plagues**, arising from **Heaven and Earth’s disharmonious qi**, transforming into **Epidemics and Plagues** that gravely harm human life. Thus, understanding **Heaven’s Primordial Principle** (*tiān yuán* 天元) allows one to **transmit the acupuncture method**, thereby **saving the people**.\n\n---\n*(End of *Huángdì Nèijīng Sūwèn Yípiān* [Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon: Lost Tracts], Volume II)*\n\n---\n*(Begin *Huángdì Nèijīng Sūwèn Yípiān* [Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon: Lost Tracts], Volume III: Treatise on Acupuncture Methods, Part II)*\n\n「The Yellow Emperor asked: *\"I have heard that when the Five Epidemics and Plagues arrive, they all spread easily among one another, regardless of whether the afflicted are great or small, their symptoms being alike. If one applies #1[**prophylactic measures**] to prevent transmission, how can one ensure that none are affected? When their diseases overlap and cling to one another, how can one avoid being infected?\"*\n\nQìbó replied: *\"Those who avoid infection retain their **Heavenly Vitality** (*zhèngqì* 正氣) within. The **Pathogenic Qi** cannot assail them. They evade the **Toxic Qi** (*dúqì* 毒氣), and as **Heaven’s nurturing principle** (*tiān pì* 天牝) returns, they regain their **Dao/Way** (*wǎng* 往). The **Toxic Qi** of the Epidemics lies in **excessive sweating** (*xièhàn* 泄汗). If one instead **induces downward elimination** (*fǎnxià qǔzhī* 反下取之), the Qi enters the body’s core, and the **Toxic Qi** reaches the brain, flowing into all the **Channels** (*jīng* 經), causing people to contract the disease.\n\nFor instance, when a person sneezes, this Qi enters through the nose into the brain. To prevent it from lingering in the nostrils, one should **direct the sneeze outward** (*ràng xǔn zhī jí chū* 令嚏之即出爾), thus avoiding infection. When the Qi exits the brain, the **Heavenly Vitality** remains intact, and the mind **guards its root** (*shén shǒu qí běn* 神守其本) like the sun. Then, the **Toxic Qi** of the Epidemics cannot harm them.\n\nBefore entering the **Epidemic Chamber** (*yìshì* 疫室), one must first **visualize the Liver’s Green Qi** (*qīngqì* 青氣) emerging from the liver, moving leftward to the **East** (*shù* 束), transforming into **forests and trees** (*línmù* 林木), like the **verdant cypress of spring**. Next, **visualize the Lung’s White Qi** (*báiqì* 白氣) emerging from the lungs, moving rightward to the **West** (*xī* 西), transforming into **weapons and armor** (*gējiǎ* 戈甲), like the **sharp, gleaming blades** of swords and spears. Then, **visualize the Heart’s Red Qi** (*chìqì* 赤氣) emerging from the heart, moving southward upward, transforming into **flames** (*yànmíng* 焰明), like the **intense, scorching heat** of summer. Next, **visualize the Kidney’s Black Qi** (*hēiqì* 黑氣) emerging from the kidneys, moving northward downward, transforming into **water** (*shuǐ* 水), like the **dark waves** of the sea. Finally, **visualize the Spleen’s Yellow Qi** (*huángqì* 黄氣) emerging from the spleen, residing in the center, transforming into **earth** (*tǔ* 土), like the **vast, yellow expanse** of the land. When the **Five Qi** (*wǔqì* 五氣) have fully **shielded the body** (*hùshēn* 护身), one should **visualize the brilliance of the Northern Dipper** (*běidǒu* 北斗) above the head. Only then can one safely enter the Epidemic Chamber, ensuring that the **Heavenly Vitality** remains intact and the **Pathogenic Qi** of the Epidemics cannot assail.\n\nAnother method: On the day of the **Spring Equinox** (*chūnfēn* 春分), before the sun rises, one should **expectorate** (*tǔ* 吐). Using **far-reaching farzhi** (*yuǎnzhì* 远志, *farzhi* 远志) with its heart removed, decocted in water, and consumed in two cups, then **expectorating**, one can avoid the Epidemics.\n\nAnother method: After the **Rain Water** (*yǔshuǐ* 雨水) solar term, on three consecutive days of **bathing with medicinal herbs** (*yàohàn* 药浴), one should **induce sweating** (*xièhàn* 泄汗). If the sweat is **foul-smelling** (*chòu* 臭), it indicates the Epidemics have been **expelled** (*wúyì* 无疫).\n\nAnother method: The **Minor Golden Elixir Formula** (*xiǎojīndān fāng* 小金丹方):\nTwo *liǎng* (两) of **Cinnabar** (*chénshā* 辰砂),\nOne *liǎng* (两) of **Realgar** (*xiōnghuáng* 雄黄), ground with water,\nOne *liǎng* (两) of **Female Realgar** (*qícǐ zhīhuáng* 雌黄, *qícǐ* 雌黄), ground with water,\nHalf a *liǎng* (两) of **Purple Gold** (*zǐjīn* 紫金).\nGrind into fine powder (*fěn zuò mò* 粉作末), ensuring it is **refined** (*lìng xì* 令细).\nCombine in a **fusion vessel** (*hé* 合), seal it externally, and **bury it one *chǐ* (尺) deep**, compacting the earth firmly around it. Do not use a furnace or require **pharmaceutical processing** (*yàozhì* 药制). Instead, **use twenty *jīn* (斤) of fire** to **melt and refine** (*duàn* 缎) it for seven days. Always maintain the fire at twenty *jīn* (斤).\n\nOn the seventh day, when the **bell-like resonance** (*líng* 玲) is heard, dig up the vessel the next day and **bury the medicine in the earth for seven days**. A **auspicious location** (*jí dì* 吉地) is preferable.\n\nAfter retrieving it, **grind it in accordance with the sun’s path** (*shùnrì yán* 顺日研) for three days. Form pills with **white sand and honey** (*báishā mì* 白沙蜜), each as large as a **Chinese parasol tree seed** (*wútóngzǐ* 梧桐子). Daily, facing the **East** (*shù* 束), inhale the **Qi of the Sun’s Radiance** (*rìhuágì* 日华气) once, swallow a pill with **iced water**, and **harmonize the Qi** before gulping it down. After ingesting ten pills, the **Pathogenic Qi** will no longer assail.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"When a person’s **Heavenly Vitality** is depleted, their **spirit** (*shén* 神) wanders and loses its position, allowing **external pathogenic influences** (*guǐshén wàigàn* 鬼神外干) to intrude, leading to premature death. How can one preserve the **True Essence** (*quánzhēn* 全真) and avoid this? I wish to hear the **acupuncture method** (*cìfǎ* 刺法).\"*\n\nQìbó bowed twice and replied: *\"Illuminating is your question! When the **spirit** (*shén* 神) drifts and loses its guard, though it remains within the body, it does not necessarily lead to death. Yet, if **Pathogenic Qi** assails it, then **lifespan is shortened** (*tiāoshòu* 夭寿). If the **Pathogenic Qi** has not yet assailed, there is no illness. But when it is about to assail, **premature death** may occur.\n\nFor example, if the **Liver’s Minor Yin** (*gèyīn* 厥阴) loses its guard, **Heaven’s nurturing principle** (*tiān pì* 天牝) becomes **vacant** (*xū* 虚), and the **human Qi** (*rénqì* 人氣) of the liver becomes **depleted** (*xū* 虚), compounding with the **Heavenly Vacancy** (*tiān xū* 天虚). The **soul** (*hún* 魂) then **wanders upward** (*yóushàng* 游於上). When the liver is **depleted** (*xū* 虚), **Heaven is vacant** (*xū* 虚), and one **sweats excessively** (*chūhàn* 出汗) in the liver region, resulting in **triple depletion** (*sān xū* 三虚), the **spirit** (*shén* 神) scatters and wanders to the upper regions. If the **Left Side’s Guardian Spirit** (*yīngjūn* 英君) does not descend, the **spiritual light** (*shén guāng* 神光) fails to gather, and the **Black Corpse Ghost** (*bái shī guǐ* 白尸鬼) invades, causing **premature death**.\n\nIf the **Pathogenic Qi** assails the **Major Qi** (*dàqì* 大氣), the body **may still be treatable** (*yǒukě cìzhī* 可刺之). When the **spiritual luster** (*shén cǎi* 神彩) remains in the eyes, though the **limbs are cold** (*sìzhī líng* 四肢玲), the **chest and abdomen are still warm** (*xīnfù shàng wēn* 心腹尚温), and the **tongue** (*shé* 舌) is **not retracted** (*bù juǎnsuō* 不卵缩), this is not **Minor Yin’s loss** (*bù gǎn gèyīn* 非感厥), and it is called **Corpse Cold** (*shī jué* 尸厥). Thus, it can be **revived** (*fǔsū* 复苏).\n\n**Puncture the Foot Minor Yang Channel** (*zú shǎoyáng jīng* 足少阳之所过), which passes through the **Hill Mound Hole** (*qiūxū* 丘墟) located below the **external ankle** (*zúwàiì* 足外踝下), in the **concave depression** (*rú qián èn* 如前陷者中), five *cùn* (寸) from the **Tear Point** (*línqì* 临泣), the **origin of the Foot Minor Yang** (*zú shǎoyáng zhī yuán* 足少阳之原). Use a **fine needle** (*háo zhēn* 毫针), warming it near the body until it is **comfortably warm** (*jìn wēn* 暖针至温). With the left hand pressing the point, recite the incantation: *\"**Supreme Primordial Lord** (*tàishàng yuánjūn* 太上元君), who **dwells perpetually on the left**, commands the **Three Souls** (*sān hún* 三魂).\"* Chant three times, then call out the names of the **Three Souls** (*sān hún míng* 三魂名): **Vital Spirit** (*cuànglíng* 爽灵), **Fetal Light** (*tāiguāng* 胎光), **Mysterious Essence** (*yōujīng* 幽精). Chant three times more, then **visualize the Green Dragon** (*qīnglóng* 青龙) beneath the point. Puncture to a depth of three *fēn* (分) of the **same-body inch** (*tóngshēncùn* 同身寸), retain for three breaths, then **gradually withdraw the needle**. Press where the patient feels **Qi** (*ànqì* 按气) at the mouth, and if there is a **gurgling sound** (*wū* 呜) in the abdomen, treatment is successful.\n\nNext, **puncture the Liver’s Back-Shu Point** (*gān zhī yù* 肝之俞), located below the **ninth vertebra** (*dì jiǔ zhuī* 第九椎下), one and a half *cùn* (寸) on either side. Use a **fine needle**, warming it until the body feels **comfortably warm**. With the left hand pressing the point, recite the incantation: *\"**Lord of the Great Mystery** (*tàiwēi dìjūn* 太微帝君), **Primordial Guardian** (*yuán yīng zhìhún* 元英制魂), **True Primordial Essence** (*zhēnyuán jíběn* 真元及本) enters the **Azure Clouds** (*qīngyún* 青云).\"* Again call out the **Three Souls’ names** as before, three times. Puncture to a depth of three *fēn* (分) of the **same-body inch**, retain for three breaths; then advance two *fēn* (分) more, retain for three breaths; finally, withdraw the needle to three *fēn* (分) and retain for one breath, then **gradually remove it**. The **Qi** will then **reach its target**, and the patient will **revive**.\n\nWhen a person’s **Heart is depleted** (*xīn xū* 心虚), and they additionally encounter the **Heavenly Fire** (*tiān huǒ* 天火) of the **Celestial Sovereign and Minister** (*jūnxiàng* 君相) losing its guard, leading to **triple depletion** (*sān xū* 三虚). Or if one **sweats excessively** (*chūhàn* 出汗) from the heart, the **spirit and soul** (*shén hún* 神魂) will **reverse and ascend** (*nì shàng* 逆於上), entering the **Filtrum** (*níwán* 泥丸). If the **Heavenly Fire** is **insufficient**, the **Black Corpse Ghost** (*hēi shī guǐ* 黑尸鬼) will invade, causing **sudden death** (*bàowáng* 暴亡). If the condition is not yet beyond recovery, though the **limbs are cold**, the **Qi** may be **blocked and severed** (*bì jué* 闭绝), yet the **complexion does not change** (*bù biàn sè* 不变色), and the **tongue** (*shé* 舌) is **not retracted** (*bù juǎn* 不卵), then the patient can still be **saved** (*kě jiù* 可救).」\n\nWhen the **divine luster** (*shén cǎi* 神彩) in the eyes remains unaltered, it can be **needled** (*kě cì* 可刺). Needle the **Hand Shao Yang** (*shǒu shào yáng* 手少阳) channel’s passage.\n\nThe **Hand Shao Yang** channel’s passage is the **Yang Pool** (*yáng chí* 阳池) point, located in the depression on the radial side of the wrist when the hand is extended. This is the **original** (*yuán* 原) of the Hand Shao Yang. Use a **hair-thin needle** (*háo zhēn* 毫针), when the patient’s body is warm, press the point with your hand, and recite the incantation three times: *\"Great Unity Sovereign Lord, Filtrum Supreme Spirit—\n**Dan Wu** (*dān wú* 丹无) repels the **Black Qi** (*hēi qì* 黑气), restoring its **true essence** (*zhēn* 真).\"* Then visualize a **crimson phoenix** (*chì fèng* 赤凤) beneath the point, insert the needle **two fen** (*èr fēn* 二分), and retain it for **seven breaths** (*liú qī hū* 留七呼). Next, advance **one fen** (*jìn yī fēn* 进一分), and retain for **three breaths** (*liú sān hū* 留三呼). Withdraw **one fen** (*tùi* 退), retaining for **one breath** (*liú yī hū* 留一呼), then slowly withdraw the needle while palpating the point—this will revive the patient.\n\nNext, needle the **Heart Shu** (*xīn shù* 心俞), located **one and a half cun** (*yī cùn bàn* 一寸半) lateral to the **fifth vertebra** (*dì wǔ zhuī* 第五椎) on the back. Use a hair-thin needle, when the patient’s body is warm, press the point with your hand, and recite the incantation three times: *\"Dan Fang guards the spirit, Five Emperors ascend to Azure—\n**Yang He** (*yáng hé* 阳和) permeates the body, restoring **Huang Ting** (*huáng tíng* 黄庭).\"* Insert the needle **seven fen** (*qī fēn* 七分) of the patient’s body length, and retain for **one fen** (*liú yī fēn* 留一分). Next, advance **one fen** (*jìn yī fēn* 进一分), and retain for **one breath** (*liú yī hū* 留一呼). Withdraw to **two fen** (*tùi zhì èr fēn* 退至二分), retaining for **one breath** (*liú yī hū* 留一呼), then slowly remove the needle while palpating the point.\n\nWhen the **spleen** (*pí* 脾) is diseased, and if the **Tai Yin** (*tài yīn* 太阴) governing the heavens loses its defense, the patient will be **stricken by triple depletion** (*gǎn ér sān xū* 感而三虚). If **excessive sweating** (*chūhàn* 汗出) occurs from the spleen, leading to **triple depletion**, the **intellect and intent** (*zhì yì* 智意) spirits will wander upward, hence the term **\"losing its guard\"** (*shī shǒu* 失守). If the **Earth** (*tǔ* 土) is **insufficient**, the **Green Corpse Ghost** (*qīng shī guǐ* 青尸鬼) will assail the patient, causing **sudden death** (*bàowáng* 暴亡). Yet within a short time, the patient may still be **saved** (*kě jiù* 可救)—if the **limbs are cold** (*sìzhī líng* 四肢玲) but the **body and lips are warm** (*shēn wēn, chún wēn* 身温、唇温), then life may be restored.\n\nIf there is **no saliva** (*kǒu zhōng wú yián* 口中无涎) in the mouth, this is called **\"corpse reversal\"** (*shī jué* 尸厥). Needle the **Foot Yang Ming** (*zú yáng míng* 足阳明) channel’s passage.\n\nThe **Foot Yang Ming** channel’s passage is the **Rushing Yang** (*chōng yáng* 冲阳) point, located **three cun** (*sān cùn* 三寸) above the **Sinking Valley** (*xiàn gǔ* 陷谷) point, in the depression between the **tibial tuberosity** (*shàng gǔ* 上骨) and the **medial malleolus** (*dòng tún* 动豚) on the medial side of the leg. This is the **original** (*yuán* 原) of the Foot Yang Ming. Use a hair-thin needle, when the patient’s body is warm, press the point with your hand, and recite the incantation three times: *\"Ever-present in the **Spirit Court** (*hún tíng* 魂庭), initially purifying **Tai Ning** (*tài níng* 太宁)—\n**Yuan He** (*yuán hé* 元和) distributes the **qi**, reaching the **Six Jia** (*liù jiǎ* 六甲) and restoring the **true essence** (*zhēn* 真).\"* Visualize **Huang Ting** (*huáng tíng* 黄庭) beneath the point, insert the needle **three fen** (*sān fēn* 三分), and retain for **three breaths** (*liú sān hū* 留三呼).

Use a hair-thin needle, when the patient’s body is warm, press the point with your hand, and recite the incantation three times: *\"Left **Yuan Zhen** (*zuǒ yuán zhēn* 左元真) person, Six Harmonies **guest qi** (*qì bīn* 气宾)—\n**Heavenly Symbol** (*tiān fú* 天符) and **Imperial Might** (*dì lì* 帝力) enter its domain.\"* Insert the needle **one and a half cun** (*yī cùn bàn* 一寸半), retain for **three breaths** (*liú sān hū* 留三呼). Next, advance **two fen** (*jìn èr fēn* 进二分), and retain for **one breath** (*liú yī hū* 留一呼). Slowly withdraw the needle while palpating the point.\n\nWhen the **kidneys** (*shèn* 肾) are diseased, and if the **Tai Yang** (*tài yáng* 太阳) governing the heavens loses its defense, the patient will be **stricken by triple depletion** (*gǎn ér sān xū* 感而三虚). If **excessive sweating** (*chūhàn* 汗出) occurs from the kidneys, leading to **triple depletion**, the **kidney spirit** (*shèn shén* 肾神) will retreat and wander at **Huang Ting** (*huáng tíng* 黄庭), though it does not leave the body, its **divine light** (*shén guāng* 神光) does not gather, hence the term **\"losing its guard\"** (*shī shǒu* 失守). If the **Water Cycle** (*shuǐ yùn* 水运) is **insufficient**, the **Yellow Corpse Ghost** (*huáng shī guǐ* 黄尸鬼) will assail the patient’s **right qi** (*zhèng qì* 正气), absorbing the **spirit and soul** (*shén hún* 神魂) and causing **sudden death** (*bàowáng* 暴亡). If the **qi is severed** (*qì jué* 气绝), the **limbs are cold** (*sìzhī jué líng* 四肢厥玲), the **heart and abdomen are slightly warm** (*xīn fù wēi wēn* 心腹微温), the **eye color does not change** (*yǎn sè bù yì* 眼色不易), and the **lips, mouth, and tongue do not alter** (*chún kǒu jí shé bù biàn* 唇口及舌不变), with **no saliva** (*kǒu zhōng wú yián* 口中无涎), then the patient may still be **saved** (*kě jiù* 可救).\n\nNeedle the **Foot Tai Yang** (*zú tài yáng* 足太阳) channel’s passage.\n\nThe **Foot Tai Yang** channel’s passage is the **Capital Bone** (*jīng gǔ* 京骨) point, located in the depression between the **red and white flesh** (*chì bái ròu jì* 赤白肉际) beneath the **lateral malleolus** (*wài cè dà gǔ xià* 外侧大骨下) on the outer side of the foot. This is the **original** (*yuán* 原) of the Foot Tai Yang. Use a hair-thin needle, when the patient’s body is warm, press the point with your hand, and recite the incantation three times: *\"**Yuan Yang** (*yuán yáng* 元阳) nurtures the infant—\nFive Elders and the **true essence** (*zhēn* 真), Filtrum’s **mysterious transformation** (*huán huà* 玄华), replenishing **jing** (*jīng* 精) for eternal preservation.\"* Visualize **black qi** (*hēi qì* 黑气) beneath the point, insert the needle **two and a half fen** (*èr fēn bàn* 二分半), and retain for **three breaths** (*liú sān hū* 留三呼). Next, advance to **three fen** (*jìn zhì sān fēn* 进至三分), and retain for **one breath** (*liú yī hū* 留一呼). Slowly withdraw the needle while palpating the point.\n\nNext, needle the **Kidney Shu** (*shèn shù* 肾俞), located **one and a half cun** (*yī cùn bàn* 一寸半) lateral to the **eleventh vertebra** (*dì shíyī zhuī* 第十一椎) on the back. Use a hair-thin needle, first pressing the point with your hand, and recite the incantation three times: *\"**Heavenly Mysterious** (*tiān xuán* 天玄) and **Imperial Crystal** (*rì jīng* 日晶)—\n**Tai He** (*tài hé* 太和) and **Kun Ling** (*kūn líng* 昆灵), **true Yuan** (*zhēn yuán* 真元) held within, sustained until **Shi Qing** (*shǐ qīng* 始青).\"* Insert the needle **three fen** (*sān fēn* 三分), and retain for **three breaths** (*liú sān hū* 留三呼).\n\nNext, advance to **five fen** (*jìn zhì wǔ fēn* 进至五分), and retain for **three breaths** (*liú sān hū* 留三呼). Slowly withdraw the needle while palpating the point.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"The interactions of the twelve **zàng** (organs/viscera) and the loss of **shén** (spirit/divine essence), causing the **shéncǎi** (spiritual complexion) to be incomplete—fearing the intrusion of **xié** (evil/noxious forces), if needling is the treatment, how may it be done? I wish to hear the essentials. Also, how do the twelve **shén** (spirits) function in their subtle ways?\"*\n\nQìbó (Gebers) bowed twice with his head to the ground and replied: *\"Your question is profound indeed! You inquire into the **zìlǐ** (ultimate principles), the **Dao** (Way) of true **zhōng** (vital harmony). This is not the domain of mere mortals—how could one explore such depths? This is where **qì** (qi) and **shén** (spirit) unite in the **Dao** (Way), aligning with the celestial patterns above.*\n\n*The movement of **rénqì** (human qi) corresponds with the **Sìtiān** (Four Heavens), while the **shénqì** (spiritual qi) harmonizes in its own way, governed by the rise and fall of **shèngkuī** (flourishing and decline).*\n\nThe **heart** (*xīn* 心) is the **official of the sovereign** (*jūnzhǔ zhī guān* 君主之官), from which **shénmíng** (divine intelligence) emerges. It governs the **tasks of the body** (*rènzhì yú wù* 任治於物), thus serving as the **official of the sovereign**. Therefore, the **heart** follows the **form** (*xíng* 形), and when **shén** (spirit) rests within the **heart**, it is sustained. Hence, the **heart** is the **dwelling of the spirit** (*shén zhī shè* 神之舍). When the **true heart** (*zhēnxīn* 真心) loses its **guard** (*shǒu* 守), it becomes **void** (*xū* 虚), and the **spirit** fails to hold its position. Then it **wanders** (*màngyóu* 妄游) through all the **chambers** (*shì* 室), unsettling the **five spirits** (*wǔ shén* 五神), and thus **emptiness** (*xū* 虚) arises. This may be treated by needling the **source of the hand Lesser Yang** (*shǒu shǎoyáng zhī yuán* 手少阴之源).\n\nThe **source of the hand Lesser Yang** (*shǒu shǎoyáng zhī yuán* 手少阴之源) is the **Duìgǔ** (Jade Bone) point, also known as **Zhēnxīn** (True Heart) or **Zhōngdū** (Central Capital, *zhōngdū* 中都). This is the **source of the true heart** (*zhēnxīn zhī yuán* 真心之源), located at the **depression on the ulnar end of the pisiform bone** (*shǒu hòu duìgǔ zhī duān xiàn zhě zhōng* 掌後兑骨之端陷者中). Using a **long needle** (*chángzhēn* 长针), with the **palm warmed** (*shǒu zhōng wēnnuǎn* 手中温暖), insert the needle **three fen** (*sān fēn* 三分), and retain for **three breaths** (*liú sān hū* 留三呼). Advance **one fen** (*jìn yī fēn* 进一分), and retain for **one breath** (*liú yī hū* 留一呼). Slowly withdraw the needle while palpating the point, and the patient will **revive** (*fùsū* 复苏).\n\n---\n\nThe **lung** is the **minister of resonance** (*xiāngfù zhī guān* 相傅之官), from which **regulation of breathing** (*zhì jié* 治节) arises. Its **rank is high, as sovereign** (*wèi gāo wéi jun* 位高为君), hence its role as **minister of resonance**. It governs the **circulation of nourishing and defensive *qi*** (*róngwèi* 荣卫), so **regulation of breathing** (*zhì jié* 治节) follows it, and **breathing** (*chuǎnxī* 喘息) occurs naturally. When there is **excessive speech and loss of regulation** (*duō yǔ shī jié* 有多语失节), or **cold, shivering, and sorrowful sighing** (*yǐn líng xíng hán bēi chàng* 饮玲形寒悲怆), it is because the **lung spirit** (*fèishén* 肺神) fails to hold its position—thus, it becomes **empty** (*jì* 虚).\n\nThe **source of the hand Greater Yin** (*shǒu tàiyīn zhī yuán* 手太阴之源) may be needled.\nThe **source of the lung** (*fèi zhī yuán* 肺之源) emerges from **Dàyuān** (Great Abyss, *dàyuān* 大渊), located at the **depression on the ulnar side of the palm, one inch and five *fen* from the large tendon** (*shǒu hòu dà jīn yī cùn wǔ fēn wèn xiàn zhě zhōng* 掌后大筋一寸五分问陷者中), where the **hand Greater Yin meridian** (*shǒu tàiyīn zhī suǒ guò* 手太阴之所过) passes. Using a **long needle** (*chángzhēn* 长针), warm it in the **mouth** (*kǒuzhōng* 口中), press the point with the hand, and insert **three *fen* equal to the patient’s body *cùn*** (*tóng shēncùn zhī sān fēn* 同身寸之三分), retaining for **three breaths** (*liú sān hū* 留三呼). When the **moving *qi* arrives** (*dòngqì zhì* 动气至), slowly withdraw the needle while palpating the point with the hand.\n\nThe **liver** is the **general’s office** (*jiāngjūn zhī guān* 将军之官), from which **planning and deliberation** (*móulǜ* 谋虑) arise. Bold yet capable of decisive action, hence it is called the **general**. Its **potential energy remains latent** (*qiánfā wèi méng* 潜发未萌), hence it is said that **planning and deliberation** (*móulǜ* 谋虑) emerge from it. When **anger arises and *qi* ascends** (*nù ér qì shàng* 怒而气上), obstructed by **encountering *qi*** (*yùqì jiāo* 遇气交), the **spirit loses its guard** (*shén shī shǒu* 神失守), and its **radiance does not gather** (*shén guāng bù jù* 神光不聚). The **previous method** (*qiánfǎ* 前法) may be applied to needle it, ensuring the **spirit fully holds its position** (*quán shén shǒu* 全神守者).\n\nThe **source of the foot Jue Yin** (*zú juéyīn zhī yuán* 足厥阴之源) may be needled.\nThe **source of the foot Jue Yin** (*zú juéyīn zhī yuán* 足厥阴之源) is the **Tàichōng** (Great Surge, *tàichōng* 太冲) point, located at the **depression two *cùn* behind the base joint of the big toe** (*zú dàzhǐ běnjié hòu èr cùn xiàn zhě zhōng* 足大趾本节后二寸陷者中), where the **liver meridian** (*gāntán suǒ guò* 肝豚所过) passes as the **source**. Using a **long needle** (*chángzhēn* 长针), first warm it in the **mouth** (*kǒuzhōng* 口中), press the point with the hand, and insert **three *fen*** (*rù sān fēn* 入三分), retaining for **three breaths** (*liú sān hū* 留三呼). Advance **two *fen*** (*jìn èr fēn* 进二分), retaining for **two breaths** (*liú èr hū* 留二呼). Slowly withdraw the needle while palpating the point with the hand.\n\nThe **gallbladder** is the organ of **central rectitude**, where decisive judgment (*juédùan*) arises. It is **unyielding and resolute in judgment**, hence its role as the organ of central rectitude. **Direct yet without doubt**, thus decisive judgment arises from it. When **emotions surge and wrath erupts**, wrath that does not cease, *qi* ascends and fails to hold its position, impairing central rectitude, risking **stagnation and choking** (*gěiyè*), with scattered *shén* light—before any evil intrusion, it may be treated with acupuncture. **Needle the source of the foot Shào Yáng**.\n\nThe **source of the foot Shào Yáng** is the **Qiūxū** (Mound Ruins) point, located at the **depression below the lateral malleolus**, five *cùn* from the **Línqì** (Tear Well) point, where the **foot Shào Yáng meridian** passes. Use a **long needle**, warm it in the **mouth**, first pressing the point with the **left hand**, inserting to **three *fēn* of body-inch**, retaining for **three breaths**; advance to **five *fēn***, retaining for **two breaths**; withdraw the needle slowly, palpating the point with the hand.\n\nThe **spleen** is the organ of **counsel and debate**, where **comprehensive knowledge** (*zhōuzhī*) arises. When the heart **retains memory**, it is called *yì* (intent); when *yì* manifests externally, it is called *zhì* (wisdom). Wisdom encompasses all things, arising from *yì* and *zhì*. Thus, **comprehensive knowledge arises from it**, rooted in intent. When **desire and obsession exhaust the mind**, wisdom falters, *shén* light scatters—preventive treatment is possible. **Needle the spleen’s source**.\n\nThe **spleen’s source** lies at the **depression below the medial malleolus**, where the **foot Tài Yīn meridian** passes as the source. Use a **long needle**, warm it in the mouth, first pressing the point with the **left hand**, inserting to **three *fēn***, retaining for **five breaths**; advance to **three *fēn***, retaining for **five breaths**; then withdraw the needle slowly, palpating the point with the hand.\n\nThe **stomach** is the organ of **granaries and defenses**, where the **five flavors** arise. It **encompasses the five grains**, hence its name as the organ of granaries and defenses. Nourishing the **four limbs**, thus the **five flavors arise**. When **overindulgence in food and drink** causes sweating, or when **gluttony and excess** follow, *qi* stagnates, *shén* wanders unguarded—before evil intrusion, **preventive treatment preserves wholeness**. **Needle the stomach’s source**.\n\nThe **stomach’s source** is the **Chōngyáng** (Rushing Sun) point, located **five *fēn* of body-inch above the medial malleolus**, on the **pulse between bones**, five *cùn* from the **Xiàngǔ** (Sunken Valley) point, where the **foot Yáng Míng meridian** passes. Use a **long needle**, warm it in the mouth, first pressing the point with the **left hand**, inserting to **three *fēn***, retaining for **three breaths**; advance to **two *fēn***, withdrawing the needle slowly, palpating the point with the hand.\n\nThe **large intestine** is the organ of **transmission**, where **transformation** arises. **Transmission** refers to conveying **impure pathways**; **transformation** refers to altering **physical form**. Thus, it is the organ of transmission, where transformation arises. When **men overindulge**, *shén* loses its position—before evil intrusion, acupuncture restores them. **Needle the large intestine’s source**.\n\nThe **large intestine’s source** is the **Hégǔ** (Union Valley) point, located at the **webbed junction of the index and thumb**, where the **hand Yáng Míng meridian** passes. Use a **long needle**, warm it in the mouth, inserting to **two *fēn***, retaining for **three breaths**; advance to **two *fēn***, retaining for **one breath**; withdraw the needle slowly.\n\nThe **small intestine** is the organ of **reception and refinement**, where **transmutation** arises. It **receives and refines** from the stomach, accepting **waste and essence**, transmitting to the large intestine—thus, it is the organ of reception and refinement, where transmutation arises. When **reception is disrupted**, whether by excess or deficiency, *shén* loses its guard—**preventive acupuncture preserves wholeness**. **Needle the small intestine’s source**.\n\nThe **small intestine’s source** is the **Wàngǔ** (Wrist Bone) point, located at the **depression on the ulnar side of the wrist**, where the **hand Tài Yáng meridian** passes. Use a **long needle**, warm it in the mouth, first pressing the point with the **left hand**, inserting to **three *fēn***, retaining for **three breaths**; advance to **two *fēn***, retaining for **one breath**; withdraw the needle slowly, then palpate the point with the hand.\n\nThe **kidneys** are the organ of **strength and vigor**, where **clever adaptability** (*zàngqiǎo*) arises. **Strength lies in action**, hence *zuòqiáng* (action-strength). **Crafting and shaping** define *qiǎo* (clever adaptability). In women, it manifests as clever adaptability; in men, as **action-strength**. When **excessive vigor leads to error**, aligning with **critical days of the trigrams and eight directions**, *shén* loses its position—**preventive acupuncture preserves wholeness**. **Needle the kidney’s source**.\n\nThe **kidney’s source** emerges at **Dàxī** (Great Creek), located at the **depression below the medial malleolus**, anterior to the heel bone, where the **foot Shào Yīn meridian** passes as the source. Use a **long needle**, warm it in the mouth, first pressing the point with the **left hand**, inserting to **three *fēn***, retaining for **one breath**; advance to **one *fēn***, retaining for **one breath**; withdraw the needle slowly, palpating the point with the hand.\n\nThe **Triple Burner** is the organ of **decision and drainage**, where **waterways** arise. It **guides *yīn* and *yáng* pathways**, opening **blockages**—thus, it governs drainage, where waterways arise. **Secondary drainage**, like the **four great rivers emptying into the sea**, does not alter their course; **all streams enter the sea**, yet only the **Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Ji** are called the four great rivers—thus, it is said to be **fourfold drainage**.\n\nThe **Triple Burner’s secondary drainage** refers to the separation of **essence** and **waterways**, hence it is said that the Triple Burner consists of **Upper, Middle, and Lower**.\n\nThe **Upper Burner** governs what is **internal and does not exit**, or what is **not originally internal yet becomes internal**—thus, it does not hold fast. The **Middle Burner** governs the **rotting and ripening of food and drink**, or when **emotions stir within**—sometimes a person is **not moved yet is moved**—this is called **lone movement**, where the **spirit loses its station**. The **Lower Burner** governs what **exits yet does not return**—or when it **should exit but does not**—thus, it is said that the **spirit loses its station**.\n\n**Needling the source of the Triple Burner**:\nThe source of the Triple Burner is the **Yang Pool** point, located on the **dorsal side of the wrist**, in the depression above the styloid process, where the **Hand Shào Yáng meridian** passes. Use a **long needle**, warm it in the mouth, first pressing the point with the **left hand**, inserting to **three *fēn***, retaining for **three breaths**; advance to **one *fēn***, retaining for **one breath**; withdraw the needle slowly, palpating the point with the hand.\n\nThe **Bladder** is the **state-capital organ**, where **essence and fluids** are stored. When **qi transforms**, they can be expelled. It occupies the **lower inner void**, hence it stores **essence and fluids**. If it receives **Qi Sea qi**, transformation occurs, and **urine and feces are discharged**. When the **Qi Sea is deficient**, **urination and defecation are obstructed**, hence it is said: *\"When qi transforms, they can be expelled.\"*\n\nIf **stool is retained** while **qi flows into the Bladder**, then **essence leaks and qi disperses**. When **waterways are not unblocked**, the **spirit loses its station**. Thus, through **complete authenticity acupuncture**, one may truly grasp this method’s profound efficacy.\n\n**Needling the source of the Bladder**:\nThe source of the Bladder is the **Capital Bone** point, located on the **lateral side of the foot**, below the **fifth metatarsal bone**, in the depression between the **red and white flesh**, where the **Foot Tài Yáng meridian** passes. Use a **long needle**, warm it in the mouth, first pressing the point with the **left hand**, inserting to **three *fēn***, retaining for **three breaths**; advance to **two *fēn***, retaining for **three breaths**; withdraw the needle slowly, palpating the point with the hand.\n\n**All twelve organs** must not lose their harmony. If they do, **calamity follows**—thus, they must not lose their harmony. When they lose their station, **spiritual radiance does not gather**, and **evil intrusions** may harm **Heaven’s mandate**, making **preventive needling for complete authenticity** essential.\n\nThus, **acupuncture methods embody the principle of nurturing the spirit and preserving authenticity**, not merely treating illness, but rather **cultivating harmony and spiritual refinement**. The **spirit is the sovereign of nurturing**, hence it is emphasized first.\n\nThe **Dao values enduring presence**—**fortifying the spirit and securing the roots**, preventing **essence and qi from scattering**, ensuring the **spirit’s station remains unbroken**. The **Three Treasures within** are **spirit, qi, and essence**. If one loses its place, all three are injured. When all three are harmoniously preserved, it is called **Primordial Harmony**.\n\nYet even if the spirit remains within the body but does not firmly hold its station, it is **not true preservation of authenticity**. If the spirit departs, **death follows**. Though it may linger within the body without departing, it is still **not true preservation of authenticity**.\n\nWhen a person’s **spirit does not hold its station**, they have **not attained true authenticity**. If the spirit does not hold its station, **luminosity is insufficient**—thus, one must **preserve authenticity and gather spiritual radiance** to cultivate the **true**, ensuring it **does not disperse**, for this is the **Dao of humanity**.\n\nThe **essence of true authenticity** lies in **Heaven’s Primordial Breath**. While in the **mother’s womb**, one first communicates with **Heaven’s Primordial Breath**—this is called the **Primordial Darkness**, named the **Gate of the Grain Spirit**, or the **Spirit’s Vertex**, or the **Upper Realm’s Earthly Gate**, or the **Central Peak of Humanity**, or the **Gate of Fetal Breath**, or the **Key to Heavenly Passage**.\n\nIf one **forgets desires**, **settles emotions**, and **moves in accordance with Heaven’s Primordial Breath**, severing all thoughts—**as if still within the mother’s womb**—this is called **Returning to Heaven’s Breath**, **reverting to the Original Command**, entering **Levity and Extinction**, returning to **Primordial Simplicity**, and restoring the **Dao of Fetal Breath**.\n\nWhen the **spirit aligns with Heaven’s Breath** and **reenters the Original Source**, it is called **Returning to the Ancestral Root**. If a person’s **illnesses are treated by a spirit that holds its station**, they may enter **Primordial Breath** and **preserve the complete authenticity of the Original Command**, making the **Dao of the spirit enduring**.\n\nFrom the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic, Plain Questions, Lost Manuscript Scroll Three* (as per the **Ming-era carving**): *\"Not...\"* #1\n\n---\n\n**#2□:** The original *Yuan* edition reads *\"Achoo.\"* **#3:** The *Ming* edition omits this section. **#4□:** The *Ming* edition reads *\"ulcerous.\"* **#5□:** The *Ming* edition reads *\"warm.\"* **#6:** There appears to be a missing passage here. **#7:** The *Yuan* edition has a single blank character after *\"tongue.\"* **#8:** *\"Divide\"* is likely a corruption of *\"breath.\"* **#9:** The *Ming* edition reads *\"encounter.\"* **#10:** The *Yuan* edition reads *\"one.\"* **#11:** The *Yuan* edition reads *\"alight.\"* **#2:** The original reads *\"labor,\"* corrected to *\"honor\"* for contextual coherence. **#3:** The original reads *\"yang,\"* corrected to *\"source\"* based on the *Yuan* edition. **#4:** Likely should read *\"one breath.\"* **#5:** The *Yuan* edition reads *\"move.\"*\n\n---\n**From the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic, Plain Questions, Lost Manuscript Scroll Four*\n*Treatise on Diseases, Part One***\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"The Nine Celestial Obstructions of the Heavenly Elements—I already understand them. I wish to hear of **qi exchange**: what does it mean when **virtue/power** is lost?\"*\n\nThe six **qi** ascend and descend, exchanging positions above and below, corresponding to the five **zàng** organs with Heaven and Earth’s constants.\n\nQī Bó replied:\n*\"When they ascend or descend improperly, shift from their proper positions, or retreat from their stations—each has its own principles. If they fail to advance upward or downward as they should, this is called **losing one’s station**.\"*\n\nThe *Celestial Element Jade Register* states:\n*\"The six **qi** always have three in Heaven and three on Earth. One **qi** ascends to Heaven as the **Left Intercalary Qi**; one enters Earth as the **Right Intercalary Qi**; one shifts to its proper position as **Celestial Sovereign**; one shifts to its proper position as **Earthly Spring**; one retreats from its position as **Left Celestial Intercalary Qi**; one retreats from its position as **Right Earthly Intercalary Qi**.\"*\n\nWhen **qi exchange** harmonizes, the **qi** naturally occupy their proper positions at the appointed time—this is when Heaven and Earth interact, and all things flourish. When Heaven and Earth fail to exchange, **disease** arises.\n\nThus, when **qi exchange** shifts from its proper position, the **qi** transform abnormally. If this transformation is irregular, the four seasons lose their order, and all transformations become unstable—**disease** ensues among the people.\n\nTherefore, among the six **qi**, some fail to ascend when they should, some fail to descend when they should, some fail to shift to their proper positions when they should, and some fail to occupy their proper stations when they should. Such deviations mean Heaven and Earth lose their natural governance, and the people become restless.\n\nThe Emperor said:\n*\"When ascent and descent fail to proceed—how does this occur? How can one discern the variations in **qi exchange**?\"*\n\nHe asked again about tracing the **source** of these changes.\n\nQī Bó replied:\n*\"Your inquiry is clear, and your understanding profound. When **qi exchange** varies, this is the **mechanism of Heaven and Earth**.*\n\n*When **Wood** seeks to ascend, it encounters the **Celestial Pillar Obstruction** and does not advance. When **Fire** seeks to ascend, it encounters the **Celestial Puff Obstruction** and does not advance. When **Earth** seeks to ascend, it encounters the **Celestial Surge Obstruction** and does not advance. When **Metal** seeks to ascend, it encounters the **Celestial Brilliance Obstruction** and does not advance. When **Water** seeks to ascend, it encounters the **Celestial Inner Obstruction** and does not advance. Thus, the **Celestial Obstructions** overcome them, and they do not advance.*\n\n*But when **qi** seek to descend and fail to do so, the **Earthly Obstructions** restrain them. **Wood** seeks to descend, but the **Earthly Barrier Obstruction** restrains it; **Fire** seeks to descend, but the **Earthly Dark Obstruction** restrains it; **Earth** seeks to descend, but the **Earthly Azure Obstruction** restrains it; **Metal** seeks to descend, but the **Earthly Vermilion Obstruction** restrains it; **Water** seeks to descend, but the **Earthly Mound Obstruction** restrains it. The nine **Earthly Obstructions** mirror the symbols of Heaven, and the **virtue/power** of the overcoming **qi** prevents descent.*\n\n*Additionally, when the five **phases** exceed their limits and arrive prematurely, **qi exchange** fails to advance. When a **Yang** year encounters its appointed time, after its arrival, the overcoming **qi** does not exceed its bounds.*\n\n*But when **qi** seek to ascend and fail, the intervening **phase** suppresses them. **Wood** seeks to ascend but encounters an excessive **Metal phase** in the intervening cycle; **Fire** seeks to ascend but encounters an excessive **Water phase**; **Earth** seeks to ascend but encounters an excessive **Wood phase**; **Metal** seeks to ascend but encounters an excessive **Fire phase**; **Water** seeks to ascend but encounters an excessive **Earth phase**. All these cases involve the **phase** exceeding its limits, arriving early in the cycle, and preempting **qi exchange**, thus suppressing ascent.*\n\n*But when **qi** seek to descend and fail, the intervening **phase** suppresses them. When the five **phases** exceed their limits and arrive prematurely, descent is hindered, and the intervening **phase** restrains them, preventing progress.*\n\n*Thus, there are cases where ascent fails, descent fails, descent fails while ascent reaches Heaven, or both ascent and descent fail—each variation differs, and the resulting calamities range from mild to severe.*\n\n*Therefore, the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth, the overcoming and restraint of **Celestial Obstructions** and **Earthly Obstructions**, and the shallow or deep suppression by the intervening **phase**—these determine why the people’s **diseases** vary in severity.*\n\nThe Emperor said:\n*\"I wish to understand how the encounters, overcoming, and suppression of **qi exchange** manifest in **disease**, and how their severity differs. I seek to clarify the origins of these disease transformations.\"*\n\nQī Bó replied:\n*\"Overcoming and suppression through encounters produce these effects. The six **qi** ascending and descending follow the established principles of **qi exchange**, which is their constant state. However, when irregular encounters occur and they converge, overcoming and suppression create stagnation.*\n\n*Thus, in years of the *Chén* branch (戊), the **Wood qi** ascends, encountering the **Celestial Pillar**, overcoming it and failing to advance. In years of the *Chén-Xū* combination (辰戌), the **Greater Yang** shifts to its proper position as **Celestial Sovereign**. The **Jué-Yin** acts as **Earthly Spring**, and by this year, it ascends to Heaven as the **Left Intercalary Qi**. Encountering the **Celestial Sovereign**, it is calculated to reach the **Celestial Pillar Obstruction**. **Wood** seeks to ascend, but the **Celestial Pillar Metal** and **Earthly Sovereign** overcome it, preventing progress. Additionally, in years of *Gēng-Xū* (庚戌), the **Metal phase** arrives prematurely, and the intervening **phase** overcomes it, suddenly halting its ascent. In a **Metal year**, the **Metal phase** arrives prematurely, and thirteen days later, **qi exchange** occurs. The **Celestial Sovereign** seeks to ascend, but the intervening **Metal phase** suppresses it.*\n\n*When the **Wood phase** ascends to Heaven, **Metal** suppresses it.\"*\n\n「Sometimes it ascends and meets the **Celestial Pillar Obstruction**, or sometimes it encounters the **Metal phase** in mid-course.\n\nWhen it ascends but does not progress, the **clear and pure** *qi* generates **wind** and **lessened vitality**, while **austerity and killing** prevail in **Spring**. **Dew and frost** return, and **grass and trees wither**.\n\nThe people suffer from **epidemic febrile diseases** that appear early, with **throat and mouth dryness**, limbs full and joints all aching—if prolonged, it transforms into **stagnant *qi*** (郁). By the day when **Heaven obtains the Left Intercalary Qi**, the disease erupts.\n\nThen **great winds** uproot and scatter, causing **collapses and sudden deaths**. The people fall ill with **sudden paralysis** and **numbness in hands and feet**.\n\nWhen **green dust** appears, **wind-febrile diseases** arise, and the people stretch their limbs rigidly, as if in **spasm** (直强). Treatment must reach the **three *yu*** (俞) points. Thus, in *Wèi-Hài* (巳亥) years, the **Sovereign Fire** ascends to Heaven, obstructed by **Celestial Pillar Obstruction**, and cannot progress.\n\nThe **Sovereign Fire** remains on Earth for three years; by *Wèi-Hài* years, **Jué-Yin** ascends to Heaven as the **Left Intercalary Qi**, which is fixed. **Celestial Pillar Water** governs **Water**, and according to *The Celestial Element Manual* (《天元册》), its calculation extends to the **Kàn Official** (坎官). When its number is subtracted, **Celestial Pillar Obstruction** becomes the governing force, so **Water** is obstructed and suppressed.\n\nAdditionally, if **Jué-Yin Wood** shifts to its proper position, **Jué-Yin** has not yet ascended to Heaven, and the **Water phase** arrives in between. The **Sovereign Fire** seeks to ascend, but the **Water phase** in mid-course suppresses it. When **Celestial Pillar Water** governs and suppresses, it is either the **Water phase** itself that obstructs it.\n\nWhen it ascends but does not progress, **clear cold** returns, and **dew** appears at dawn and dusk. The people suffer from **latent *yang*** (伏阳), with internal **restlessness and heat**, a **startled and fearful spirit**, and alternating **cold and heat**, eventually leading to **stagnant *qi*** (郁). If **cold and heat** persist for **forty-nine days** (二七), it is considered prolonged. Then **violent heat** emerges, **red wind** causes **pupillary dilation** and **clouding of vision**, transforming into **epidemic febrile diseases** (疫), with **warm diseases** (温疠) also arising.\n\nBy the day when **Heaven obtains its proper position**, the disease manifests. It evolves into **stagnant pestilence** (郁疠), generating **latent heat** and internal **restlessness**, leading to **paralysis with sudden attacks** (痹而生厥), and in severe cases, **blood overflows** (血溢).\n\nWhen **red *qi*** (赤气) arises and transforms into **great epidemic febrile diseases** (大疫), all suffer from **restlessness and intense thirst**, with severe thirst being the key to treatment—**draining** it can halt the disease.\n\nThus, in *Zǐ-Wǔ* (子午) years, **Great Yin** ascends to Heaven, obstructed by **Celestial Pillar Obstruction of Chōng** (天冲), and cannot progress.\n\n**Great Yin** remains on Earth for two years; in the following year, it ascends to Heaven as **Jué-Yin’s Left Intercalary Qi**, which is fixed. **Celestial Pillar Obstruction of Chōng**, however, has its own method—it cannot be definitively calculated in advance.\n\nIf **Celestial Pillar Obstruction of Chōng** is encountered, **Earth** cannot easily ascend it, hence the saying: *\"it ascends but does not progress.\"*\n\nAdditionally, if it meets *Rén-Zǐ* (壬子), the **Wood phase** arrives prematurely. **Wood** ascends on the day of **Great Cold** (大寒), and if it arrives early, **thirteen days** before its proper time, it encounters these two **Wood suppressions** (抑). **Earth** shifts and suppresses it greatly, resulting in deep illness.\n\nWhen it does not ascend to Heaven, **wind dust** rises in all directions, causing **dusty haze** (埃昏) at times, with **rain and dampness** failing to dissipate. The people suffer from **wind-paralysis** (风厥), **drooling and tides of heat** (涎潮), **one-sided paralysis** (偏痹) that does not follow the limbs, **distension and fullness**, and prolonged **latent *qi* stagnation** (伏郁).\n\nIf it fails to ascend for **ten days**, it is considered prolonged. Then **yellow dust** transforms into **epidemic febrile diseases** (疫). The **Intercalary Qi** ascending to **stagnant *qi*** (郁) becomes a **great epidemic** (大疫).\n\nThe people suffer from **early death**, with **yellow jaundice** closing over the face, limbs, and flanks. **Dampness** does not spread, and **rain dissipates** only slightly. When **yellow dust** rises and **yellow wind** transforms into **epidemic febrile diseases**, all suffer from **limb pain** and **bitter taste in the mouth**.\n\nThus, in *Chǒu-Wèi* (丑未) years, **Lesser Yang** ascends to Heaven, obstructed by **Celestial Pillar Obstruction of Pēng** (天蓬), and cannot progress.\n\n**Lesser Yin** remains on Earth for three years; by this year, it ascends to Heaven as **Great Yin’s Left Intercalary Qi**, which is fixed. **Celestial Pillar Obstruction of Pēng** loses its calculated position, and there is no fixed method for its occurrence.\n\nIf it is encountered, the **Water phase** can ascend to **Fire**, so it cannot easily ascend. Additionally, if **Great Yin** has not yet shifted to its proper position, **Lesser Yin** has not yet ascended to Heaven, and the **Water phase** arrives in between. When it does not ascend to Heaven, these two suppressions occur.\n\nIf it does not ascend to Heaven, **cold dew** reappears, and the chill is as severe as in **Winter** (凛冽如冬). **Water** returns to its dry state, and **ice reforms**. **Warmth** suddenly appears, while **dew** spreads again. **Cold and warmth** are untimely, and the people suffer from **latent *yang*** within, with **restlessness and heat** in the middle, a **startled and terrified spirit**, and **cold and heat** contending alternately, eventually leading to **stagnant *qi*** (郁). If **cold and heat** persist for **forty-nine days**, it is considered prolonged.\n\nThen **violent heat** emerges, causing **red wind** and **pupillary dilation with clouded vision**. By the day when **Heaven obtains its proper position**, the disease manifests. It evolves into **stagnant pestilence** (郁疠), generating **latent heat** and internal **restlessness**, leading to **paralysis with sudden attacks** (痹而生厥), and in severe cases, **blood overflows**.\n\nWhen **red *qi*** (赤气) arises and transforms into **great epidemic febrile diseases** (大疫), all suffer from **restlessness and intense heat**. **Cool medicines** cannot subdue the **stagnant *yang* fire** (火之郁), which is more severe than the **Sovereign Fire**, hence **paralysis with sudden blood overflow** (厥乃血溢).\n\nThus, in *Yín-Shēn* (寅申) years, **Bright Yang** ascends to Heaven, obstructed by **Celestial Pillar Obstruction of Yīng** (天英), and cannot progress.\n\n**Bright Yang** remains on Earth for three years; by this year, it ascends to Heaven as **Lesser Yang’s Left Intercalary Qi**, which is fixed as per the **scriptures and commentaries**.\n\n**Nine Obstructions** (九窒) follow the **Heavenly cycles** but are insufficient; **Metal** encounters **Fire Obstruction**, which can suppress it but cannot ascend to Heaven. If it meets *Wù-Shēn* (戊申) or *Wù-Yín* (戊寅), the **Fire phase** arrives prematurely.\n\nIn years where the **Fire phase** exceeds its proper time, the **phase exchange** has not yet occurred, and the **Fire phase** arrives **thirteen days** early. **Metal** seeks to ascend to Heaven, but the **Fire phase** suppresses it. If it encounters one such suppression, it cannot ascend; if two coincide, the suppression is even greater.\n\nWhen it ascends but does not progress, **timely rains** fail to descend, and **west winds** rise frequently, generating **salty and arid *qi*** (咸卤燥). **Earth’s salty and arid *qi*** (地咸卤) produces **whiteness**, and when **nitre** (硝) appears, **dryness** arises.\n\nThe people suffer from **upper-body heat**, **wheezing and coughing with blood overflow**, and prolonged **stagnant *qi*** (郁). If it does not ascend for **forty-nine days**, **Fire** is considered prolonged.\n\nThen **white dust** clouds the air, **clear *qi*** generates **killing energy** (杀气), and the people suffer from **flank distension and melancholy**, **chronic cold with sneezing and hoarseness**, and **dry skin that cracks** (手拆皮肤). When **white dust** rises, **killing epidemic febrile diseases** (杀疫) and **fire diseases** (火生) emerge, and the people all suffer from **dryness and throat constriction**—treatment can involve **acupuncture**.\n\nThus, in *Mǎo-Yǒu* (卯酉) years, **Celestial Sovereign** ascends to Heaven, obstructed by **Celestial Pillar Obstruction of Nèi** (天内), and cannot progress.\n\n「When the **Celestial Sovereign** (太阳) completes its three-year tenure on Earth, this year it ascends to Heaven, acting as the **left minister of Yangming** (阳明之左问), which is already defined in the *Canon* (经) and *Commentaries* (论). Its ascent to Heaven is accompanied by **Celestial Pillar Obstruction of Nèi** (天内), as the sequential laws dictate. When **Water** encounters **Earth**’s obstruction, it cannot ascend, and though it is subdued, it remains vibrant.\n\nAgain, if it meets **Yangming** (阳明) before it has moved to its proper position—meaning the **Celestial Sovereign** has not yet ascended to Heaven—**Earth**’s influence arrives instead. In **Jǐ-Yǒu** (己酉) and **Jǐ-Mǎo** (己卯) years, **Water** seeks to ascend to Heaven, but **Earth**’s influence suppresses it. Sometimes, one sees **Celestial Pillar Obstruction of Nèi** (天内) suppressing it, or **Earth**’s influence subduing it—either way, there is an imbalance. When it ascends but does not progress, **dampness and heat** (湿而热) steam, giving rise to **twofold cold** (寒生两问). The people suffer from **stagnant *qi*** (郁) that does not disperse, lingering until it becomes prolonged. If it does not descend for **twelve days**, it is considered prolonged.\n\nWhen **cold** arrives as a guest and **heat** prevails, **hail and ice pellets** (冰雹) suddenly descend. The people suffer from **ulcerative cold** (厥逆而秽), where **heat** festers within and **cold *qi*** stagnates without, causing **foot foulness, acidity, and pain** (足腥酸疼). This may also generate **palpitations, restlessness, and heat** (心悸懊热), sudden agitation followed by **ulcerative cold** (而复厥). When **black dust** (一黑埃) rises, leading to **cold epidemic febrile diseases** (寒疫), the people all suffer from **agitation and palpitations** (皆烦而悸厥)—treatment can involve **emesis** (吐).\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor** (黄帝) asked: *\"When it ascends but does not progress, I have already understood its meaning. Now I wish to hear about when it descends but does not descend—can I gain clarity?\"* He sought further elucidation of this **Dao** (道).\n\n**Qī-Bó** (岐伯) replied: *\"Your question is thorough indeed! This is what is called the **subtle interplay of Heaven and Earth** (天地微旨), and through this, the full **Dao** (道) of ascent and descent can be revealed. Just as it is said: 'Ascension must be followed by descent.'*\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** ascends to Heaven as the **left minister for one year**, then in the **second year** it moves to its proper position as **Sovereign of Heaven** (司天), in the **third year** it retires to become the **right minister** (右问), and by the **fourth year**, it descends. After three years in Heaven, it must descend in the following year. Upon descending into Earth, it begins once more as the **left minister**.\n\nAs the **left minister on Earth for one year**, the next year it becomes **Sovereign of Earth** (司地) in its proper position, and the following year it retires to become the **right minister**. Thus, the cycle of ascent, descent, and return is called the **Six Periods** (六纪).\n\nThree years in Heaven, three years on Earth—if it does not descend in a year, it brings **calamities and disasters** (灾害). First, one must clarify its ascent; then, one must exhaustively explore its descent. Therefore, in **Chǒu-Wèi** (丑未) years, **Celestial Sovereign of Gǔyīn** (厥阴) descends to Earth, obstructing **Earth’s Clarity** (地晶), and though subdued, it does not enter fully.\n\nAgain, if **Gǔyīn** remains in Heaven for three years, the next year it descends, but it also encounters **Earth’s Ninefold Obstruction** (地九窒), where **Earth’s Clarity** (地晶) in the west is blocked by **Jué** (兑), and **Metal** (金) governs its suppression, preventing it from entering its proper domain. When suppressed and unable to enter, it transforms into **diseases among the people** (民病).\n\nSometimes it meets **Shàoyīn** (少阴) before its retreat. **Shàoyīn** has excess influence in Heaven, acting as the **Administrator of Affairs** (布政), and thus has not yet retreated one position. When **Gǔyīn** has not yet descended, **Metal**’s influence arrives in the middle. In **Yǐ-Chǒu** (乙丑) and **Yǐ-Wèi** (乙未) years, one sees **Metal** suppressing it. When **Metal**’s influence follows and suppresses it, the descent does not occur, and the **stagnant *qi*** (郁) lingers, forming **diseases among the people** (民病).\n\nWhen **Wood** seeks to descend, **Metal** follows and suppresses it. If it does not descend, **blue dust** (苍埃) appears from afar, and **white *qi*** (白气) follows, with **wind** lifting the dust into a dim haze. **Clear and restless *qi*** (清躁) then brings **killing energy** (杀), and **frost and dew** descend again, issuing **stern and killing decrees** (肃杀布令). If it lingers and does not descend, the suppressed **stagnant *qi*** (郁) transforms into **diseases among the people**. If it does not descend for **three days** but descends on the **eighth day**, and if it does not descend at all, it will generate **wind epidemic febrile diseases** (风疫). This is when **wind and restless *qi*** (风躁) become stagnant, and **warmth reverses to coldness** (暄而反清). When **grass and trees** begin to sprout, the **killing frost** (杀霜) arrives prematurely, unseen, causing **fear of coldness and injury to the *zàng* organs** (惧清伤藏). The **warmth and harmony of the seasons** (暄和令节) are followed by **great cold and killing energy**, which then issue **killing frost** (布杀霜). When **blue dust** appears, the **wind epidemic febrile diseases** arrive, and treatment can involve **emesis** (吐) to achieve relief—but **descent is then impossible**.\n\nThus, in **Yǐn-Shēn** (寅申) years, **Shàoyīn** descends to Earth, obstructing **Earth’s Mysterious Depths** (地玄), and though subdued, it does not enter fully. After three years in Heaven, **Shàoyīn** descends in the fourth year, but if it encounters **Earth’s Obstruction** (地窒), it governs **Earth’s Mysterious Depths** (地玄), and **Water** obstructs its descent, preventing it from entering. The suppressed **stagnant *qi*** (抑伏) then transforms into **diseases among the people**.\n\nSometimes it meets **Bǐng-Shēn** (丙申) or **Bǐng-Yǐn** (丙寅) years, where **Water**’s influence is excessive, arriving before its proper time. When **Water**’s influence is excessive and arrives in the middle, **Shàoyīn** descends but does not descend fully, forming **stagnant *qi*** (郁) and bringing **calamities to the people** (灾).\n\nWhen the **Sovereign Fire** (君火) seeks to descend, **Water** follows and suppresses it. If it does not descend, **red clouds** (彤云) appear faintly, and **black *qi*** (黑气) emerges in reverse. The warmth spreads like relaxation, but **cold** constantly issues **spiritual decrees** (布灵), and **piercing cold** (凛冽) returns. The **Heavenly clouds** (天云) grow dark and continuous. If it lingers and does not descend, the suppressed **stagnant *qi*** (伏) transforms into **diseases among the people**. If it does not descend for **two days** but descends on the **seventh day**, and if it does not descend at all, the **stagnant *qi*** (郁) will erupt. **Cold** overpowers and **heat** returns, generating **red wind epidemic febrile diseases** (赤风化疫), where the people suffer from **flushed faces, agitated hearts, headaches, and dizziness** (面赤心烦，头痛目眩). The **red *qi*** (赤气) becomes evident, and **warm epidemic febrile diseases** (温病) are about to emerge. The people are restless and cannot sleep at night, and **yellow wind epidemic febrile diseases** (黄风化疫) arise—treatment can involve **drainage** (泄).\n\nThus, in **Mǎo-Yǒu** (卯酉) years, **Tàiyīn** (太阴) descends to Earth, obstructing **Earth’s Blue Depths** (地苍), and though subdued, it does not enter fully. After three years in Heaven, **Tàiyīn** descends into Earth in this year, becoming **Shàoyīn’s left minister** (少阴左问). It also encounters the obstruction of **Earth’s Blue Depths** (地苍窒), where **Wood** governs its suppression, preventing it from entering. Sometimes it meets **Shàoyáng** (少阳) before its retreat, meaning **Tàiyīn** has not yet been able to descend, or **Wood**’s influence arrives. In **Dīng-Yǒu** (丁酉) and **Dīng-Mǎo** (丁卯) years, **Wood**’s influence follows and suppresses it, causing it not to descend. The suppressed **stagnant *qi*** (伏) then transforms into **diseases among the people**. If it does not descend for **ten days**, it is considered prolonged.\n\nWhen **Heavenly dust** (天埃) and **yellow *qi*** (黄气) appear, and **Earth** issues **damp and steaming *qi*** (湿蒸), the people suffer from **limbs that cannot lift**, **dizziness, limb-joint pain**, and **abdominal distension** (腹满填臆). If **yellow wind** (黄风) rises three times, the people suffer from **warmth and dampness**, all experiencing **distension and fullness** (痞满)—treatment can involve **strong purgation** (大下) to heal.\n\nThus, in **Chén-Xū** (辰戌) years, **Shàoyáng** descends to Earth, obstructing **Earth’s Mysterious Depths** (地玄), and though subdued, it does not enter fully. After three years in Heaven, **Shàoyáng** descends into Earth the following year, becoming **Tàiyīn’s left minister** (太阴左问), governing **Earth’s Mysterious Depths** (地玄窒). **Water** obstructs its descent, and suppression prevents it from entering, transforming into **diseases among the people**. Sometimes it meets **Water**’s excessive influence, arriving before its proper time as well.\n\n---\n\n**Bingchen (丙辰) and Bingxu (丙戌) years are those of the Water cycle (水运).** When Water’s cycle is ascendant yet does not descend, even if **scarlet clouds** (彤云) appear faintly, **black qi** (黑气) surges forth, **warmth** (暄暖) threatens to arise, and **cold qi** (玲气) suddenly strikes—at its worst, it brings **hail and ice** (冰雹). If it lingers without descending, the suppression turns into **stagnant dampness** (郁). When it does not descend for two days but descends on the seventh, if it fails to descend, **stagnant dampness** erupts.\n\nIf **cold qi** (冷气) clashes with **heat** (热), **red wind** (赤风) transforms into **epidemic pestilence** (化疫), and the people suffer from **flushed faces and restless hearts** (清面赤心烦), **headaches and blurred vision** (头痛目眩). When **red qi** (赤气) is prominent and **heat diseases** (热病) are about to emerge, the people fall ill with **insomnia and restlessness** (夜讣不安). **Yellow wind** (黄风) transforms into **epidemic pestilence** (化疫), and relief may come from **draining** (泄) it to heal.\n\nThus, in **Weihai (巳亥) years**, **Yangming** (阳明) descends to Earth, obstructing **Earth’s Scarlet Depths** (地彤), yet though subdued, it does not enter fully. **Yangming** remains in Heaven for three years; the following year, it descends into Earth, becoming **Shàoyáng’s left minister** (少阳左问). If it encounters **Earth’s Scarlet Depths** (地彤), **Fire** (火) governs the suppression, preventing it from entering, and this transforms into **disease** (化成病). If **Tàiyīn** (太阴) has not yet relinquished its position, then **Shàoyáng** (少阳) cannot descend, and **Fire’s cycle** (火运) arrives instead.\n\n**Guiwei (癸巳) and Guihai (癸亥) years** are those of the **Fire cycle** (火运). When Fire’s cycle is ascendant yet does not descend, the sky clears and grows **stern** (肃), and **red qi** (赤气) becomes prominent, **heat** (暄热) surges back, leaving the people all **drowsy and restless** (昏倦), unable to sleep at night. Their throats grow **dry, prompting them to drink** (咽乾引饮), and they suffer from **internal heat and agitation** (懊热内烦). In the morning, the air is **clear and cold** (大清), but by evening, **heat returns** (暄还复作). If it does not descend for nine days, the suppression turns into **stagnant dampness** (郁). When it does not descend for four days but descends on the ninth, if it fails to descend, **stagnant dampness** erupts.\n\nIf the sky is **clear and thin with cold** (黄帝内经素问遗篇卷之四 #1), **white qi** (白气) arises from afar, and the people suffer from **vertigo and numbness in limbs** (掉眩), **straightened limbs without sensation** (手足直而不仁), **pain in the sides and mouth** (两胁口□#5), and **eyes appearing blurred** (满目忙忙). When **white qi** is abundant and **killing epidemics** (杀疫) arrive, the people all become **dry, with parched throats and constricted breathing** (燥而咽乾轨钮), and treatment can involve **acupuncture** (刺) to relieve them.\n\nThus, in **Ziwu (子午) years**, **Tàiyáng** (太阳) descends to Earth, obstructing **Earth’s Obstructed Depths** (地阜), yet though subdued, it does not enter fully. **Tàiyáng** remains in Heaven for three years; the following year, it descends again into Earth, becoming **Yangming’s left minister** (阳明左问). If it encounters **Earth’s Obstructed Depths** (地阜), **Earth** (土) governs the suppression, preventing it from entering, and this transforms into **disease** (化成病). If **Earth’s cycle** (土运) is excessive, it arrives before its proper time.\n\n---\n**Annotations (for reference only, not included in translation):**\n#1: *Original text has \"黄帝内经素问遗篇卷之四 #1本\" with a missing character, later corrected as \"天清薄寒\" (clear yet thin with cold) in the translation.*\n#2: *Suspected typo in \"二日\" (two days), possibly intended as \"三日\" (three days) based on context.*\n#3: *Missing character in \"螫虫未见\" (sting insects not yet seen), later inferred as \"乃下\" (descends) in the translation.*\n#4: *Suspected typo in \"九#4\", later corrected as \"久\" (long/lingering) in the translation.*\n#5: *Missing character in \"口□#5\", later corrected as \"作痛\" (pain) in the translation.*\n\n**Earth’s Cycle** (土运) takes its turn, descending yet failing to enter—then **Heaven** (天) manifests the **black qi** (黑气), dim and gloomy, withering and harsh. Only then does **yellow dust** (黄埃) appear and spread dampness, while **cold** (寒) transforms the **qi** (气), and steaming dampness follows again.\n\nIf it lingers long without descending, the **qi** (气) becomes suppressed and stagnant. When **Earth’s Cycle** (土运) fails to descend for **twelve days** (十二日), its stagnation will erupt. The people suffer from **great collapse** (大厥), with limbs heavy and sluggish, **erectile dysfunction** (阴痿) and diminished strength. **Heaven** (天) spreads **deep yin** (沉阴), steaming dampness and **cold** (寒) together.\n\nWhen **black qi** (黑气) is manifest and **cold epidemic** (寒疫) arrives, the people suffer from **collapse** (厥) and heavy limbs. Treatment may involve reinforcing them.\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"The ascending and descending do not proceed in order; I wish to understand its principle. May I hear of **Deranged Rectification** (迁正), so that I may grasp its meaning?\"*\n**Clarify** (晰) means **clear** (明).\n\n**Giber** (岐伯) replied: *\"**Rectification** (正) governs the central position; this is called **Deranged Rectification of Position** (迁正位). When **Heaven’s Official** (司天) fails to **Derange Rectification** (得其迁正), it is because **Heaven’s Official** (司天) arrives before its proper time, exceeding the **Great Cold** (大寒) day and altering the **year’s rectification** (岁正). The **initial qi** (初气) has not yet arrived. If **Heaven’s Official** (司天) is excessive with lingering days, it still follows the old **Heaven’s Rectification** (治天数), as the new **Heaven’s Official** (司天) has not yet **Deranged Rectification** (得迁正). The year is determined by the **exchange** (交), meaning **Heaven’s Official** (司天) has not yet completed its term.\n\nWhen **Jueyin** (厥阴) fails to **Derange Rectification** (迁正), **wind and warmth** (风暄) are untimely, and flowers and plants wither. The people suffer from **dribbling urination** (淋搜), **ocular tension** (目系转), **spasmodic tetany** (转筋), and **anger-induced disorders** (喜怒), with **urine appearing red** (小便赤).\n\nWhen **Taiyang** (太阳) governs **Heaven** (司天), its **Heaven’s Rectification** (天数) lingers. On the day of **Retreating Rectification** (退位), **Jueyin** (厥阴) may **Derange Rectification** (得治迁正). **Wind** (风) seeks to order itself, yet **cold** (寒) lingers unresolved. Warmth and **dampness** (暄) are deranged, and **Spring Rectification** (春正) loses its proper time. Though the **initial qi** (初气) may arrive, **Heaven’s Command** (天令) does not propagate, and **Wood’s qi** (木气) does not unfold. Thus, the people fall ill with **liver disorders** (病肝).\n\nWhen **Shaoyin** (少阴) fails to **Derange Rectification** (迁正), **cold qi** (冷气) does not retreat. **Spring** (春) lingers with **cold**, warmth and **dampness** (暄暖) are untimely, and the people suffer from **alternating cold and heat** (寒热), with limbs and back aching and **stiffness** (强直).\n\nWhen **Jueyin** (厥阴) governs **Heaven** (司天), its **Heaven’s Rectification** (天数) lingers. Though **Jueyin** (厥阴) may have lingering days, another **Rectification** (位) governs **Heaven** (司天), and all **Heaven’s Rectifications** (天数) must complete their full day before **Deranging Rectification** (迁正). For example, when **Shaoyin** (少阴) arrives at **Spring Equinox** (二月春分) to take its proper position, the **transformations** (造化) shift, and **Deranged Rectification** (迁正) may occur. This aligns with **Heaven’s Official** (司天).\n\nThough **Wood’s qi** (木气) may linger, its position does not exceed that of **Jinghuo** (君火). If **Wood’s qi** (木气) has lingering days beyond its due, it again governs **Heaven** (治天), and its **Heaven’s Rectification** (治数) is not yet complete. When it encounters **Jinghuo** (君火) arriving on time, **Spring Equinox** (春分) allows **Deranged Rectification** (迁正), and **Wood’s qi** (木气) has not yet retreated. Thus, it may still align with **Heaven’s Rectification** (治天). The lingering **qi** of others does not behave thus.\n\nWhen **Taiyin** (太阴) fails to **Derange Rectification** (迁正), **clouds and rain** (云雨) lose their proper ordering, and all things wither and dry. What should flourish does not. The people suffer from **swollen limbs and joints** (手足肢节肿满), **abdominal dropsy** (大腹水肿), **distended abdomen refusing food** (填臆不食), **chronic diarrhea with flank distension** (飧泄胁满), and **limbs failing to rise** (四肢不举).\n\nWhen **Shaoyin** (少阴) governs **Heaven** (司天), its **Heaven’s Rectification** (天数) is not yet complete, hence **Taiyin** (太阴) cannot **Derange Rectification** (得迁正). When **Shaoyin** (少阴) completes its term, **Taiyin** (太阴) may **Derange Rectification** (得迁正). **Rain’s transformation** (雨化) seeks to order itself, yet **heat** (热) still governs it. The warmth is gentle, yet **excessive** (亢) without **nourishment** (泽).\n\nIf **Shaoyin** (少阴) lingers beyond its due, **Earth’s qi** (土气) does not unfold properly, and the people fall ill with **spleen disorders** (病於脾).\n\nWhen **Shaoyang** (少阳) fails to **Derange Rectification** (迁正), **scorching heat** (炎灼) does not arrive in order, and sprouts do not thrive. **Extreme summer heat** (酷暑) lingers into **Autumn**, **austerity and killing** (肃杀) arrive late, and **frost and dew** (霜露) are untimely. The people suffer from **nodular malaria** (瘤疟), **bone heat** (骨热), **palpitations and terror** (心悸惊骇), and in severe cases, **blood spattering** (血溢).\n\nThough it may be the **Year of the Tiger** (寅) or the **Year of the Monkey** (申), **Earth** (土) still governs. On the day of **Retreating Rectification** (退位), **Fire** (火) brings **extreme summer heat** (酷暑) afterward, hence the lingering **summer heat into Autumn** (涉暑於秋).\n\nWhen **Yangming** (阳明) fails to **Derange Rectification** (迁正), **summer heat** (暑) transforms prematurely, followed by **austerity** (肃) later, and grasses and trees flourish in reverse. The people suffer from **alternating cold and heat with sneezing** (寒热叹嚏), **hair and fur disorders** (皮毛折), **dry and brittle nails** (爪甲枯焦), and in severe cases, **shortness of breath and panting** (喘嗽), **high-pitched breathing** (息高), **sorrow and discontent** (悲伤不乐).\n\nWhen **Shaoyang** (少阳) governs **Heaven** (司天), its **Heaven’s Rectification** (天数) lingers. On the day of **Retreating Rectification** (退位), **Yangming** (阳明) fails to **Derange Rectification** (迁正), hence there are many who suffer from **restlessness, thirst, and shortness of breath** (烦燥渴喘).\n\n**Heat’s transformation** (热化) spreads, yet **dryness’s transformation** (燥化) does not arrive. **Clear and forceful** (清劲) **qi** (气) has not yet acted, and **Metal’s qi** (肺金) falls ill again. Though it may be the **Year of the Rabbit** (卯) or the **Year of the Rooster** (酉), **Fire’s transformation** (火化) still governs **heat’s ordering** (热之令), hence **Metal** (肺) bears the burden of illness again.\n\nWhen **Taiyang** (太阳) fails to **Derange Rectification** (迁正), **winter cold** (冬清) reverses into **cold**, and **ease** (易令) arrives in **Spring**. **Killing frost** (杀霜) precedes, while **cold ice** (寒冰) follows. **Yang light** (阳光) again governs, with **piercing cold** (凛冽) not arising, and **dew and clouds** (露云) awaiting their proper time. The people suffer from **warm epidemic disorders** (温疠至), **closed throat with dryness** (喉闭溢乾), **restlessness and thirst** (烦燥而渴), and **shortness of breath with sound** (喘息而有音).\n\nWhen **Yangming** (阳明) governs **Heaven** (司天), its **Heaven’s Rectification** (天数) lingers. On the day of **Retreating Rectification** (退位), **Taiyang** (太阳) **Deranges Rectification** (迁正), hence there are many who suffer from **restlessness, thirst, and shortness of breath** (烦燥渴喘).\n\n**Cold’s transformation** (寒化) awaits **dryness’s transformation** (燥), still governing **Heaven’s qi** (天气), yet **disordering the sequence** (失序), bringing calamity to the people. Though it may be the **Year of the Dragon** (辰) or the **Year of the Dog** (戌), **cold’s transformation** (清化) still governs **Heaven** (治天), hence the **disorder in sequence** (失序).\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"The timing of **Deranged Rectification** (迁正) is early or late; I wish to understand its meaning. May I hear of **Retreating Rectification** (退位), so that I may grasp its clarity?\"*\n\n**Giber** (岐伯) replied: *\"What is called **not retreating** (不退者) is when **Heaven’s Rectification** (天数) is not yet complete. If **Heaven’s Rectification** (天数) is not yet complete, its **qi** (气) still governs. Though it encounters the **exchange** (交司), it is because its **rectification** (位) has not yet retreated. If **Heaven’s Rectification** (天数) lingers, it is called **Reiterated Governance** (复布政), hence the term **re-governing Heaven** (再治天). **Heaven’s Command** (天令) remains as before, yet its **rectification** (位) does not retreat. This is **governing Heaven in excess** (治天下过), still lingering in **Heaven** (犹在天).\n\nWhen **Jueyin** (厥阴) does not retreat, **great wind** (大风) arises early, and **timely rain** (时雨) does not descend. **Dampness’s ordering** (湿令) does not transform. The people suffer from **warm epidemic disorders** (温疫), **skin lesions with wind** (疵废风生), and all fall ill with **pain in limbs, head, and eyes** (皆肢节头目痛), **internal stagnant heat** (伏热内烦), and **dry throat compelling drinking** (咽喉乾引饮).\n\n**Jueyin** (厥阴) has lingering **Heaven’s Rectification** (天数), governing **Heaven** (司天) above its proper term. Its **qi** (气) is high, yet its calamity transforms well. **Heaven’s Command** (令) acts as **Reiterated Governance** (布政) and again brings calamity below, hence the **reverse severity** (反甚之者).\n\nWhen **Shaoyin** (少阴) does not retreat, **warmth** (温) arises in **Spring and Winter**, **stinging insects** (垫虫) arrive early, and grasses and trees sprout. The people suffer from **diaphragmatic heat** (膈热), **dry throat** (咽乾), **blood spattering and terror** (血溢惊骇), **red and painful urination** (小便赤涩), and **nodular rashes, eruptions, ulcers, and lingering toxins** (丹瘤疹疮疡留毒).\"\n\nShaoyin’s **Heavenly Phase** (天下#3) is excessive, surpassing the year’s term and again enacting **Reiterated Governance** (布政). **Heaven’s Command** (天令) becomes harsh, its calamities severe.\n\nTaiyin does not retreat from its position, causing **untimely cold and heat** (寒暑不时), **dusty haze and mist** (埃昏布作), and **warmth’s command** (温令) persisting. The people suffer **weak limbs** (四肢少力), **inability to eat or drink** (食饮不下), **diarrhea, dysentery, urinary retention** (泄注淋满), **cold in the leg channels** (足经寒), **erectile dysfunction and urinary blockage** (阴痿闭塞), **incontinence** (失溺), and **frequent urination** (小便数).\n\nTaiyin’s **Heavenly Phase** (天下#4) remains excessive, extending past the year while still governing **Heaven** (治天). Its **qi** descends excessively (气其#5下矣), and its calamities reach the **kidneys** (病至肾也).\n\nShaoyang does not retreat from its position, causing **heat to arise in Spring**, **Summer’s transformation delayed**, **Winter warmth without frost**, **unfrozen flowing water**, and **early emergence of stinging insects** (垫虫出见). The people suffer **shortness of breath** (少气), **alternating chills and fever** (寒热更作), **rectal bleeding with upper-body heat** (便血上热), **firm, distended lower abdomen** (小腹坚满), **deep red, turbid urine** (小便赤沃), and in severe cases, **blood spattering** (血溢).\n\nShaoyang’s **Heavenly Phase** (天数) is excessive, extending past the year while still governing **Heaven** (治天). In extreme cases, its **qi** descends again (气复下), and its calamities afflict the **spleen and lungs** (灾至脾肺藏也).\n\nYangming does not retreat from its position, causing **Spring’s clear, crisp winds** (清玲) to arise late, **grasses and trees blooming tardily**, and **alternating chills and fever** (寒热问作). The people suffer **vomiting and sudden diarrhea** (呕吐暴注), **inability to eat or drink** (食饮不下), **constipation** (大便乾燥), **limbs unable to move** (四肢不举), **blurred vision and dizziness** (目瞑掉眩).\n\nYangming’s **Heavenly Phase** (天数) is excessively dominant, extending into the next year while still governing **Heaven** (治天). Its **qi** descends again (气复降), and its calamities severely afflict the **liver** (灾至甚於肝藏也).\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"The early or late arrival of Heaven’s years—I understand this. May I inquire about Earth’s phases (地数), and may I hear them?\"*\n\nGebi replied: *\"The laws of Earth’s descent, ascent, and failure to retreat—these govern Earth’s soil transformations and the untimely changes in all things. When the proper timing for generating ten thousand things is disrupted, the sequence of phases is lost, and Heaven’s Command brings calamities to the people. This is when the upper and lower **Stems** (干) lose their proper alignment.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"I have heard that Heaven and Earth’s **Two Heavenly Stems** (二甲子) and the **Twelve Branches** (十二支) weave the upper and lower patterns of Heaven and Earth. When their phases shift and fail to hold their positions, may this be clarified?\"*\n\n*\"When the Two Heavenly Stems do not align in virtue (德), this is called **losing their guard** (失守).\"*\n\nGebi said: *\"When phases shift improperly, even if the year’s proper term is obtained, the governing phase is not secured. Then the four seasons are disordered, and great epidemics arise. When Heaven and Earth fail to align in virtue (德), this is called **Heaven and Earth losing their nodes** (失节). The upper and lower **Stems and Branches** (二管) do not harmonize in sound, and the **Great Clapper** (大不主) and **Heaven’s Master** (天主) lose their nodes. The upper and lower **Stems** are out of tune, and all things become unstable.\"*\n\nThe annotation from *The Secret Talks of the Mystic Pearl* (《玄珠密语》) states:\n*\"In a **Yang Year** (阳年), thirty years pass, excluding six years of **Heavenly Punishment** (天刑), leaving twenty-four years of excess. Excluding **Gengzi** (庚子) and **Gengwu** (庚午)—where **Metal** is punished by **Central Fire** (君火刑金运)—\n**Gengyin** (庚寅) and **Gengshen** (庚申)—where **Relative Fire** (相火) punishes **Metal** (刑金运)—\n**Wuxu** (戊戌) and **Wencheng** (戊辰)—where **Major Yang** (太阳) punishes **Fire** (刑火运).\nThese are the years when **Heaven and Earth’s qi** align with the **Central Cycle** (中运), and no excess occurs. Excluding these six years, all others function as **excessive years** (太过), contrary to their intended purpose. This is the **excess** within the **Yang Year’s Central Cycle** (阳年中运余). If there is an improper alignment of **Stems and Branches** (上下失支迭位), then it does not occur as intended. Now, when **Stems and Branches** shift improperly, they may also manifest as **deficiency** (不及).*\n\n*A **Yang Year** is a **Central Cycle of Excess** (运太过). The **Five Phases’ sounds** (五音) are all fixed, and the **Great Sound** (太音) prevails. The **Central Cycle** overcomes its own phase with excess but suffers no perverse harm, hence it is called **proper transformation and epidemic** (正化疫). When the **Stems** of **Yang** do not correspond to the **Stems** of **Yin**, the upper and lower do not harmonize, **Yin and Yang** become disordered, and **Heaven and Earth** fail to align in virtue (德). Though the **Central Cycle** is excessive in **Yang**, it still produces **excessive overcoming** (胜复乃至).*\n\n*For example, in a **Jiazi** (甲子) year, the **Central Cycle of Excess** is **Earth** (土运太窒). When **Earth** is excessive, it injures **Metal**, and **scaled insects** (鳞虫) prevail. The **kidney’s qi** is insufficient, as **Earth** overcomes **Water** (土胜於水). This is why the **Yellow Bell** (黄锺) **Stem’s sound** is high, hence it is called **excessively constricted** (太窒).*\n\n*The **Jiazi** year’s **qi** corresponds above to the **Zhen Star** (镇星), which is grand and bright. For instance, in a **Guihai** (癸亥) year with an excessive **Heavenly Phase** (天数有余), though the year transitions to **Jiazi**, **Jia** governs **Zi** but has not yet ascended to its proper position (迁正). **Jueyin** still governs **Heaven** (治天). Though **Jiazi** governs **Heaven** by term, it still transforms into **wind and crispness** (化风玲), and **Jueyin** continues to enact **Reiterated Governance** (布正於天) in **Heaven**. **Earth** has already ascended to its proper position, with **Yangming** at the **Spring** (在泉). It is also called **governing Earth** (司地), referring to the phase with high **Heavenly Phase** (数高者). The previous year was **Shaoyang**, which governed the **right question** (右问). **Guihai** governs **Earth**, and **Shaoyang** has retreated from its position, thus governing the **Earth’s right question qi** (地下之右问气). This is why **Jueyin’s Earth** and **Yangming** do not harmonize in their duties (不相和奉). Hence, it is said that the upper and lower do not harmonize (上下不相招), **Yin and Yang** become disordered (阴阳有相错), and **Gui** and **Si** oppose each other (癸与巳相对), so **Heaven and Earth** fail to align in virtue (天地不合德). This is because they do not align with **Jia** (以不合甲也). When **Gui** and **Si** converge (癸巳相会), the **Earth Central Cycle** is excessive, yet **Wood** prevails in vain, and **Metal** counterattacks. When **Metal** counterattacks, **Shaoyin** appears as if it has arrived, but **Wood** prevails like **Fire**, while **Metal**’s counterattack is weak. This is because **Shaoyin** appears while **Jueyin** has not yet retreated, and **Shaoyin** establishes itself. **Metal** seeks to counterattack, but **Fire** arrives, hence the **counterattack is slight** (复有少也). Thus, **Jia** and **Ji** lose their guard (甲己失守), and three years later, an **Earth epidemic** (土疫) manifests, reaching **Mao** (卯) late. From **Jiazi** to **Dingmao** (丁卯) spans four years. If it arrives early, it reaches **Bingyin** (丙寅) in three years. When the **Earth epidemic** arrives, it is the time of the **Four Directions** (四维). Good or bad, great or small—this is deduced from **Heaven and Earth’s** alignment, examined through **Taiyi** (太一).*\n\n*Again, take the **Jiazi** year: if **Jia** aligns with **Zi** upon exchange, it should govern **Heaven** by term (应交司而治天). **Shaoyin** governs the **Jiazi** year, ascending to its proper position in time (司天迁正应时). Below, **Ji**, **Mao**, and **Wei** have not yet ascended to their proper positions, while **Wuyin** (戊寅) **Shaoyang** has not retreated. There is also an alignment below between **Jia** and **Ji** (甲己下有合). **Jia** opposes **Wu** (甲与戊相对), and **Zi** opposes **Ding** (子与东酊个).\"\n\n「Now, if the **Earth epidemic** (*tǔ yì* 土疫) is not excessive (*tài guò* 太过), yet the **Wood** (*mù* 木) **qi** (*qì* 氣) takes advantage of its weakness and overcomes the Earth, then the **Metal** (*jīn* 金) **qi** follows and again overcomes it—this is the reversal of **evil transformations** (*xiéhuà* 邪化). If the overcoming is slight or does not recur, then in the following three years, the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) will manifest, called **Earth epidemic** (*tǔ lì* 土疠), whose symptoms resemble those of **Earth epidemic** (*tǔ yì* 土疫). Its origin is from **Heaven’s** (*tiān* 天) **epidemic** (*lì* 疠), descending to Earth, hence the reversal of evil transformations.\n\nThe **yin** and **yang** of Heaven and Earth differ thus, so its severity—great or small, good or evil—follows the alignment of Heaven and Earth’s **dharma** (*fǎzhǐ* 法旨). Suppose **Bingyin** (丙寅) is a **yang** year of excess (*tài guò* 太过), like **Yǐchǒu** (乙丑) having surplus **Heavenly Stems** (*tiānshù* 天數). Though the exchange (*jiāo* 交) yields **Bingyin** (丙寅), though **Bing** (丙) obtains **Yin** (寅), it has yet to ascend to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正) and act as **Shaoyin** (少阴) governing Heaven (*sìtiān* 司天). **Taiyin** (太阴) still governs Heaven, while Earth has already ascended to its proper position, with **Jiyin** (厥阴) governing Earth (*sìdì* 司地). Sometimes, it governs **in the Spring** (*zàiquán* 在泉).\n\nLast year, **Taiyang** (太阳) governed, acting as **right question** (*yòuwèn* 右问). In **Yǐchǒu** (乙丑), Earth governs, and by **Gēngchén** (庚辰), **Taiyang** (太阳) retreats its position (*tuìwèi* 退位) and acts as **right question** (*yòuwèn* 右问). Thus, Heaven is **Taiyin** (太阴) while Earth is **Jiyin** (厥阴), so Earth does not follow Heaven’s transformations (*huà* 化). The **yin** and **yang** are misaligned (*xiāngcuò* 相错), and **Bing** (辛) and **Yi** (乙) do not harmonize (*xiānghé* 相合), so their **virtues** (*dé* 德) are not joined.\n\nWhen **Yi** (乙) and **Xīn** (辛) meet, the **Water** (*shuǐ* 水) **qi** (*qì* 氣) is excessively depleted (*tàixū* 太虚), and it suffers a reversal under Earth’s victory (*shèng* 胜), hence not being excessive (*tài guò* 太过). This is the **Tàizhù** (太簇) **pipe**, where **Tàiyǔ** (太羽) does not respond, Earth’s **qi** (*qì* 氣) prevails, and rain transforms (*huà* 化), Water receding into **Wind** (*fēng* 風). Though Heaven and Earth are not in their proper time (*fēishí* 非時) yet possess their **qi** (*qì* 氣), the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) will manifest as a great calamity (*dàyì* 大疫), differing from the usual **yin-yang** cycles (*fùyīng* 復應).\n\nThis occurs when **Bing** (丙) and **Xīn** (辛) fail to maintain their meeting (*shīshǒu* 失守), and in the following three years, the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) becomes **Water epidemic** (*shuǐ lì* 水疠), reaching as late as **Jǐsì** (己巳). From **Bingyin** (丙寅) to **Jǐsì** (己巳) spans four years. If it arrives early, it reaches **Wǔchén** (戊辰). From **Bingyin** (丙寅) to **Wǀchén** (戊辰) takes three years. The severe cases are swift (*sù* 速), the mild ones gradual (*xú* 徐). If gradual, it reaches **Jǐsì** (己巳), and the **Water epidemic** (*shuǐ yì* 水疫) arrives.\n\nIts severity—great or small, good or evil—is deduced from the **Heavenly Stems** (*tiānshù* 天數) of the year and **Taiyi** (太乙) **wandering through the palaces** (*yóugōng* 游宫). Again, take the **Bingyin** (丙寅) year: if **Bing** (丙) aligns with **Yin** (寅) and they meet, it should govern Heaven (*sìtiān* 司天) by exchange (*jiāo* 交) and proper ascension (*qiānzhèng* 迁正). **Shaoyang** (少阳) governs Heaven, ascending to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正) in time (*yìngshí* 应时).\n\nYet **Xīn** (辛) and **Yǐsì** (巳) have not yet ascended to their proper positions (*qiānzhèng* 迁正), and **Gēngchén** (庚辰) **Taiyang** (太阳) has not retreated its position (*tuìwèi* 退位), so **Bing** (丙) and **Xīn** (辛) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德). **Bing** (丙) opposes **Gēng** (庚), and **Chén** (辰) aligns with **Yin** (寅) in position (*wèi* 位), so the **Water** (*shuǐ* 水) **qi** (*qì* 氣) is not excessively depleted (*tài guò* 太过). If the **Water** (*shuǐ* 水) **qi** (*qì* 氣) is slightly depleted yet slightly victorious (*xiǎoshèng* 小勝), there may be a recurrence (*fù* 復). When **Bingyin** (丙寅) arrives, there is no recurrence (*wúfù* 無復). In the following three years, the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) manifests, called **Water epidemic** (*shuǐ lì* 水疠), whose symptoms resemble **Water epidemic** (*shuǐ yì* 水疫). It is also known as **Cold epidemic** (*hán lì* 寒疠). The treatment method is as before.\n\nSuppose **Gēngchén** (庚辰) is a **yang** year of excess (*tài guò* 太过), like **Jǐmào** (己卯) having surplus **Heavenly Stems** (*tiānshù* 天數). Though the exchange (*jiāo* 交) yields **Gēngchén** (庚辰) year, though **Gēng** (庚) aligns with **Chén** (辰), it has yet to ascend to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正). **Yangming** (阳明) still governs Heaven, while Earth has ascended to its proper position, with **Taiyin** (太阴) governing Earth (*sìdì* 司地). Sometimes, it governs **in the Spring** (*zàiquán* 在泉).\n\nLast year was **Bingshēn** (丙申), where **Shaoyang** (少阳) acted as **right question** (*yòuwèn* 右问). In **Gēngchén** (庚辰), **Dingyǒu** (丁酉) ascends to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正), and in **Xīnjǐ** (辛巳), **Bingshēn** (丙申) retreats its position (*tuìwèi* 退位). Thus, Heaven is **Jiyin** (厥阴) while Earth is **Yangming** (阳明), so Earth does not follow Heaven’s transformations (*huà* 化). **Yangming** (阳明) should govern Heaven in conjunction with **Shaoyin** (少阴), but it does not harmonize with **Jiyin** (厥阴), so **Ding** (丁) and **Xīn** (辛) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德).\n\nWhen **Ding** (丁) and **Xīn** (辛) meet, the **Wood** (*mù* 木) **qi** (*qì* 氣) is excessively depleted (*tàixū* 太虚), and it suffers a reversal under **Metal** (*jīn* 金) victory (*shèng* 胜), hence not being excessive (*tài guò* 太过). This is the **Lúobīn** (萝宾) **pipe**, where **Tàijiǎo** (太角) does not respond, **Metal** (*jīn* 金) **qi** (*qì* 氣) prevails in dryness (*zào* 燥), and **Fire** (*huǒ* 火) **qi** (*qì* 氣) recedes into **Heat** (*rè* 熱).\n\nThis is the **Heavenly Stems** (*tiānshù* 天數) and **Earthly Branches** (*dìzhī* 地支) not in their proper time (*fēishí* 非時), and their **qi** (*qì* 氣) does not follow its usual course (*bùjié* 不節), so in three years, a great calamity (*dàyì* 大疫) will manifest across the land (*xíngtiānxìa* 行天下). This occurs when **Yi** (乙) and **Gēng** (庚) fail to maintain their meeting (*shīshǒu* 失守), and in the following three years, the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) becomes **Metal epidemic** (*jīn lì* 金疠). The severe cases are swift (*sù* 速), reaching as early as **Rénwǔ** (壬午). From **Gēngchén** (庚辰) to **Rénwǔ** (壬午) takes three years, which is its swift arrival (*sù zhì* 速至). The mild ones are gradual (*xú* 徐), reaching **Guǐwèi** (癸未), and the **Metal epidemic** (*jīn yì* 金疫) arrives.\n\nIts severity—great or small, good or evil—is deduced from the **Heavenly Stems** (*tiānshù* 天數) of the year and **Taiyi** (太一). The year when the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) arrives also encounters a failure to maintain the meeting (*shīshǒu* 失守), so its calamity (*zāi* 災) is great. If **Five Blessings** (*wǔfú* 五福) and **Taiyi** (太一) are not seen, then the calamity will cause more than half of the people to die (*èsǐ rén tàibàn* 惡死人太半). If they are seen yet the meeting of **virtues** (*hé dé* 合德) is restored, then the calamity is small. If **Five Blessings** (*wǔfú* 五福) and **Taiyi** (太乙) are seen, then the calamity will be small, and more than half of the people will be spared (*shànmiè qíbàn* 善滅其半).\n\nAgain, take the **Gēngchén** (庚辰) year: if **Gēng** (庚) aligns with **Chén** (辰) and they meet, it should govern Heaven (*sìtiān* 司天) by exchange (*jiāo* 交) and proper ascension (*qiānzhèng* 迁正). **Taiyang** (太阳) governs **Gēngchén** (庚辰) year, ascending to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正) and governing Heaven (*zhì tiān* 治天) in time (*yìngshí* 应时). Yet **Yǐwèi** (乙未) has not yet ascended to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正), and **Jǐwǔ** (甲午) **Shaoyin** (少阴) has not retreated its position (*tuìwèi* 退位), so **Yǐ** (乙) and **Gēng** (庚) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德). **Jia** (甲) opposes **Gēng** (庚), and **Chén** (辰) aligns with **Wǔ** (午) in position (*wèi* 位), so this order fails to maintain its meeting (*shīshǒu* 失守) and is not excessively aligned (*tài guò* 太过).\n\nIf **Yǐwèi** (乙未) **dryness** (*gān* 干) lacks **rigidity** (*gāng* 剛), it is also a slight depletion of **Metal** (*jīn* 金) **qi** (*qì* 氣), with a slight victory or no recurrence (*yǒuxiǎoshèng huòwúfù* 有小勝或無復). **Taiyin** (太阴) ascends to **Wèi** (未), so there is no recurrence (*wúfù* 無復). In the following three years, the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) manifests, called **Metal epidemic** (*jīn lì* 金疠), whose symptoms resemble **Metal epidemic** (*jīn yì* 金疫). **Metal epidemic** (*jīn yì* 金疫) is also called **Killing epidemic** (*shā lì* 杀疠), and **Metal epidemic** (*jīn lì* 金疠) is also called **Killing epidemic** (*shā lì* 杀疠). The treatment method is as before.\n\nSuppose **Rénwǔ** (壬午) is a **yang** year of excess (*tài guò* 太过), like **Xīnjǐ** (辛巳) having surplus **Heavenly Stems** (*tiānshù* 天數). Though the exchange (*jiāo* 交) yields **Rénwǔ** (壬午) year, though **Rén** (壬) aligns with **Wǔ** (午), it has yet to ascend to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正). **Jiyin** (厥阴) still governs Heaven, while Earth has ascended to its proper position, with **Yangming** (阳明) governing **in the Spring** (*zàiquán* 在泉). **Dingyǒu** (丁酉) governs (*zhì* 治). Last year was **Bingshēn** (丙申), where **Shaoyang** (少阳) acted as **right question** (*yòuwèn* 右问). In **Rénwǔ** (壬午), **Dingyǒu** (丁酉) ascends to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正), and in **Xīnjǐ** (辛巳), **Bingshēn** (丙申) retreats its position (*tuìwèi* 退位).\n\nThus, Heaven is **Jiyin** (厥阴) while Earth is **Yangming** (阳明), so Earth does not follow Heaven’s transformations (*huà* 化). **Yangming** (阳明) should govern Heaven in conjunction with **Shaoyin** (少阴), but it does not harmonize with **Jiyin** (厥阴), so **Ding** (丁) and **Xīn** (辛) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德). When **Ding** (丁) and **Xīn** (辛) meet, the **Wood** (*mù* 木) **qi** (*qì* 氣) is excessively depleted (*tàixū* 太虚), and it suffers a reversal under **Metal** (*jīn* 金) victory (*shèng* 胜), hence not being excessive (*tài guò* 太过).\n\nThis is the **Lúobīn** (萝宾) **pipe**,\n\n**Shaoyin** (少阴) in the **Rénwǔ** (壬午) year governs Heaven in season, ascending to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正). Yet **Dingyǒu** (丁酉) below fails to ascend, and **Bingshēn** (丙申), **Shaoyang** (少阳) of Earth, does not retreat its position (*tuìwèi*). Thus, **Ding** (丁) and **Rén** (壬) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德).\n\n**Rén** (壬) and **Bing** (丙) oppose each other, while **Wǔ** (午) and **Shēn** (申) align—this is a failure of governance, not harmonization, and thus not an excess (*tài guò*). **Ding** (丁), soft and yielding, lacks firmness, so the **Wood** (*mù* 木) **qi** (*qì* 氣) is slightly depleted (*xiǎo xū* 小虚), with minor victory and minor reversal. When **Yangming** (阳明) arrives, there is no reversal.\n\nIn the following three years, **cātè** (疠) arises—named **Wood cātè** (*mù cātè* 木疠)—its form resembling wind plague (*fēngyì* 风疫). Treatment follows prior methods, with **great vomiting** (*dà tù* 大吐) as the remedy.\n\nSuppose in a **Wùshēn** (戊申) **Yang** year of excess (*tài guò*), akin to **Dingwèi** (丁未) years of excess—even if the **Wùshēn** (戊申) year arrives—**Wù** (戊) has not yet ascended to its proper position. **Taiyin** (太阴) still governs Heaven, Earth has already ascended, and **Jiyin** (厥阴) is at the **Spring** (*quán* 泉). **Guǐhài** (癸亥) governs Earth.\n\nLast year, **Rénxū** (壬戌), **Taiyang** (太阳) retreated its position as **right question** (*yòuwèn* 右问). Thus, Heaven was **Dingwèi** (丁未), Earth **Guǐhài** (癸亥), so Earth did not follow Heaven’s transformations (*huà* 化). **Jiyin** (厥阴) should govern above in conjunction with **Shaoyang** (少阳), yet it does not harmonize with **Taiyin** (太阴), so **Ding** (丁) and **Guǐ** (癸) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德). When **Ding** (丁) and **Guǐ** (癸) meet, the **Fire** (*huǒ* 火) **qi** (*qì* 氣) is excessively depleted (*tàixū* 太虚), suffering reversal under **Fire** victory (*shèng* 胜), hence not being excessive (*tài guò*). This is the **Yízhé** (夷则) **pipe**, where the **upper Great Zheng** (*shàng tài zhēng* 上太征) does not respond. Since **Wù** (戊) and **Guǐ** (癸) do not harmonize, the **Fire** **qi** (*qì* 氣) does not respond, and the **Yízhé** **pipe** does not answer its **Zheng** (*zhēng* 征). Below, the **Guǐhài** (癸亥) **pipe** responds to the **minor Zheng** (*xiǎo zhēng* 少征), for **Guǐhài** (癸亥) governs Earth. Thus, the **same-sounding** (*tóngshēng* 同声) does not respond, and Heaven and Earth above and below do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德), hence no response.\n\nThis is **Wù** (戊) and **Guǐ** (癸) failing to govern their meeting, and in three years, **plague** (*yì* 疫) arises, arriving swiftly by **Gēngxū** (庚戌)—three years in total. Its severity—great or small, benevolent or malevolent—is determined by the **Heavenly Stem** (*tiānshù* 天数) of the plague’s arrival and the **Taiyi** (太一). Again, as with **Wùshēn** (戊申), when **Wù** (戊) arrives at **Shēn** (申), it should govern Heaven in season, ascending to its proper position.\n\nBelow, **Guǐhài** (癸亥) has not ascended, and **Rénxū** (壬戌), **Taiyang** (太阳), has not retreated its position. Thus, **Wù** (戊) and **Guǐ** (癸) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德). **Rén** (壬) and **Wù** (戊) oppose each other, while **Shēn** (申) and **Xū** (戌) align—this is a failure of governance, not harmonization, nor excess. Below, **Guǐ** (癸), soft and yielding, lacks firmness, so the **Fire** **qi** (*qì* 氣) is slightly depleted (*xiǎo xū* 小虚), with minor victory and possibly no reversal. When **Jiyin** (厥阴) arrives, there is no reversal.\n\nIn the following three years, **cātè** (疠) arises—named **Fire cātè** (*huǒ cātè* 火疠). Treatment follows prior methods: **cooling** (*lǎn* 寒) and **draining** (*xiè* 泄).\n\nThe above five failures of governance bring five plagues; the below five failures bring five **cātè** (疠). When both **Yang** (*gāng* 刚) and **Yin** (*róu* 柔) **Stems** jointly govern the **qi** (*qì* 氣) cycle, yet a **Branch** (*zhī* 支) fails to hold its position, these five methods apply—all in **Yang** years.\n\n**Huángdì** (黄帝) asked: *\"When human **qi** (*qì* 氣) is insufficient, Heaven’s **qi** is like a void, and human **spirit** (*shén* 神) loses governance, the **spirit-light** (*shēnguāng* 神光) does not gather—evil spirits assail the person, leading to untimely death. May this be heard?\"*\n\n*\"When human **qi** (*qì* 氣) and Heaven’s **qi** both lose governance, evil spirits assail the person, causing death.\"*\n\n**Qíbó** (岐伯) replied: *\"The five **viscera** (*zàng* 藏) of a person—if one is insufficient and encounters Heaven’s void, it is susceptible to **evil influences** (*xié* 邪). The deficient **viscus** resonates with Heaven’s void **qi** (*qì* 氣).*\n\n*When a person is anxious, overthinks, or is troubled, the **Heart** is injured. If this occurs while **Shaoyin** (少阴) governs Heaven and Heaven’s **Stem** (*shù* 数) is insufficient, and **Taiyin** (太阴) arrives as **right question** (*yòuwèn* 右问), this is called **Heaven’s void** (*tiān xū* 天虚)—thus, human **qi** and Heaven’s **qi** are both void.*\n\n*Again, if startled and **jing** (*jīng* 精) is depleted, sweat emerges from the **Heart**. Great startlement causes sweat from the **Heart**, depleting the **Heart’s** **vessel-pulse** (*mài* 脉), so the **spirit** (*shén* 神) loses governance of the **Heart**. Thus, the three voids—**Heart**, **spirit**, and **light**—cause the **spirit** (*shén* 神) to lose governance.*\n\n*First, there is a disease of **spirit-labor** (*láoshén* 劳神), and then encountering **Shaoyin** (少阴) with insufficient Heavenly **Stem** (*shù* 数), further startled and **jing** (*jīng* 精) depleted—these three convergences cause the **spirit** (*shén* 神) to lose governance.*\n\n*The **Heart** is the sovereign’s **viscus**, from which **spirit** (*shén* 神) and **clarity** (*míng* 明) emerge. If the **Heart** first has disease, and then encounters Heaven’s void, it is further burdened by Heaven’s excess void. The **Heart**, entrusted to govern all things, is thus the sovereign’s **viscus**. In **clarity** and **stillness**, it holds **spirit** (*shén* 神), hence it is said that **spirit** (*shén* 神) and **clarity** (*míng* 明) emerge from it.*\n\n*When the **spirit** (*shén* 神) loses governance, it wanders to the **upper elixir field** (*dāntián* 丹田), beneath **Taiyi** (太一) **Emperor** (*Dìjūn* 帝君) and **Níwán** (泥丸) **Lord** (*Jūn* 君). The **Taiyi** (太一) **Emperor** (*Dìjūn* 帝君), in the head, is the **Níjiǔ** (泥九) **Lord**, commanding all **spirits** (*shén* 神). The **Earth** (*dì* 地) **Lord** (*Jūn* 君) is the sovereign’s **viscus**; when the **spirit** (*shén* 神) loses its position, it wanders here, not guarding the **Heart**.*\n\n*The **spirit** (*shén* 神) having lost governance, the **spirit-light** (*shēnguāng* 神光) does not gather. The **spirit-light** is the **flying round light** (*fēiyuán guāng* 飞圆光). If the round light is impure, it becomes deficient, and **evil spirits**, **Yin corpses** (*yīn shī* 阴尸), and **ghosts** (*guǐ* 鬼) assail the person. If this occurs in a year when **Fire** is insufficient, **black corpse ghosts** (*hēi shī guǐ* 黑尸鬼) appear, causing sudden death. The **Fire** **qi** (*qì* 氣) being insufficient is not only in **Guǐ** (癸) or **Wù** (戊) years—failure of governance likewise, nor is it only when **Fire** governs Heaven insufficiently.*\n\n*The **black corpse ghost** (*hēi shī guǐ* 黑尸鬼) resembles a black dog, with a woman’s head—hair disheveled, unbound, eyes large. When seen by people, it drains their **spirit** (*shén* 神) and **soul** (*hún* 魂). It emits a great cry, and the person suddenly dies.*\n\n*Excessive **drinking**, **eating**, **labor**, and **fatigue** injure the **Spleen** (*pí* 脾).*\n\nWhen one overindulges in drinking, eating, and sexual activity, the **Spleen** (*pí* 脾) **qi** stagnates, and when labor and pestilential **qi** converge, the **Spleen**’s stored essence falls ill. Again, if one encounters a year when **Taiyin** (太阴) governs Heaven insufficiently, the **Shaoyang** (少阳) **qi** rises to compensate, which is called **emptiness** (*xū* 虚). When a person’s **qi** and Heaven’s **qi** are both insufficient, they are struck by the **emptiness** of Heaven and man, and by **double emptiness**.\n\nThis is when a person’s **qi** is empty and Heaven’s **qi** is empty, and if they further overindulge in food and drink, sweat emerges from the **Stomach** (*wèi* 胃). If they are drunk and gluttonous and engage in sexual activity, sweat emerges from the **Spleen**. When the **Spleen** and **Stomach** sweat, **essence** and **blood** are depleted, and they are struck by Heaven’s **emptiness**, forming **triple emptiness** (*sān xū* 三虚). The **Spleen’s spirit** (*shén* 神) loses its post.\n\nThus, **triple emptiness** arises, and the **Spleen’s spirit** loses its post. First, there is illness in the **Spleen**; then, encountering Heaven’s **emptiness**, the **Spleen** is struck by **double emptiness**. If sweat emerges and depletes **essence** and **blood**, this is called **triple emptiness**. The **Spleen** is the **Censor-in-Chief** (*jiànyì zhī guān* 谏议之官), from which wisdom emanates. The **Spleen** is the **Heart’s** (*xīn* 心) child; when the **Heart** remembers, it is called **intent** (*yì* 意). What emerges from intent is called **wisdom** (*zhì* 智). When wisdom encompasses all things, it is called **spirit** (*shén* 神). Thus, the **Spleen’s** spirit, intent, and wisdom lose their post.\n\nWhen the spirit loses its post, the **spiritual radiance** (*shén guāng* 神光) shifts and does not gather. When the **spiritual radiance** does not gather, **ghosts** and **evil spirits** assail them. If this occurs in a year when **Earth** is insufficient—whether in **Jǐ** (己) or **Jiǎ** (甲) years, or when **Taiyin** governs Heaven insufficiently—**green corpse ghosts** (*qīng shī guǐ* 青尸鬼) appear, causing sudden death. If one sits long in damp places or forcibly enters water, the **Kidneys** (*shèn* 肾) are injured. When sweat emerges from the **Kidneys**, **essence** and **blood** are depleted, thus forming **triple emptiness**. When **essence** is lost, the **Heart’s spirit** loses its post.\n\nThe **Kidneys** are the **Minister of Strength** (*zuòqiáng zhī guān* 作强之官), from which ingenuity emanates. Thus, **triple emptiness** arises, and the **Kidney’s spirit** loses its post, with **spirit** and **will** (*shí* 志) shifting. The **spirit**, **essence**, and **will**—the three **spirits**—become empty and shift, wandering beneath the **Yellow Court** (*Huángtíng* 黄庭) where the **Lord of Destiny** (*Sìmìng Jūn* 司命君) presides. Thus, the **circular radiance** (*yuán guāng* 圆光) becomes deficient. If this occurs in a year when **Wood** is insufficient—whether in **Xīn** (辛) years lacking correspondence, **Bǐng** (丙) years, or when **Taiyang** (太阳) governs Heaven insufficiently—**yellow corpse ghosts** (*huáng shī guǐ* 黄尸鬼) arrive, and seeing them causes sudden death. If **triple emptiness** persists and **Water** is insufficient, **yellow corpse ghosts** assail them, with cow-like heads and yellow bodies. Seeing them drains one’s **spirit** and **soul**, causing sudden death.\n\nIf one suffers from **anger** rising and not descending, the **Liver** (*gān* 肝) is injured. If this occurs while **Juéyin** (厥阴) governs Heaven insufficiently, **Shaoyin** (少阴) **qi** rises to compensate, which is called **Heaven’s emptiness**. The **Liver** first falls ill, then is struck by **double emptiness** from Heaven. This is called **Heaven’s emptiness** and **man’s emptiness**. If they further engage in hasty movement or fear, sweat emerges from the **Liver**. The **Liver** is the **General** (*jiāngjūn zhī guān* 将军之官), from which planning and deliberation emanate. The **spirit’s** post is lost, and the **spiritual radiance** does not gather. When the **spiritual radiance** does not gather, the **circular radiance** becomes deficient and incomplete, and **corpse ghosts** assail them. If this occurs in a year when **Wood** is insufficient—whether in **Dīng** (丁) years lacking correspondence, **Rén** (壬) years, or when **Juéyin** governs Heaven insufficiently—**white corpse ghosts** (*bái shī guǐ* 白尸鬼) appear, causing sudden death.\n\nFor those with **triple emptiness**, the **spirit** wanders and loses its post. **White corpse ghosts** assail them, with hawk-like heads and white bodies, white hair. Seeing them drains one’s **spirit** and **soul**, causing sudden death.\n\nThe above five cases of losing one’s post are when **Heaven’s emptiness** and **man’s emptiness** coincide, with the **spirit** wandering and losing its post, and the five **corpse ghosts** assailing them, causing sudden death—this is called **corpse syncope** (*shī jué* 尸厥). If one suddenly dies without drooling, with a retracted tongue like a coiled egg, or if **corpse syncope** occurs with drooling and a retracted tongue, this is **severe syncope**.\n\nIf one violates the **Five Spirits’** (*wǔ shén* 五神) proper positions, the **spiritual radiance** becomes incomplete. It is not only **corpse ghosts**—all manner of **evil spirits** assail them because the **spirit** has lost its post. When the **spirit** loses its post, even within the body, the **Two Qi** (*èr qì* 二气) lose their positions, and the **spiritual radiance** does not gather, allowing **evil spirits** to assail them. If **demons** and **spirits** communicate and pass through, it is because the **Five Spirits** have lost their posts, and **evil** has arrived.\n\nThis is why those who **guard** (*shǒu* 守) live, and those who lose their post die. Those who **guard** maintain their original positions, with the **Five Spirits** each occupying their proper abode. Thus, the **spiritual radiance** becomes bright and gathers, and all **evil spirits** do not assail them—they live. Those who **obtain the spirit** prosper; those who lose the **spirit** perish.\n\nAs **Laozi** says: *\"When **qi** enters the body, it is called life; when the **spirit** departs the body, it is called death.\"* Thus, life arises from the **spirit**; when the **spirit** is present, life is sustained. When the **spirit** departs, life is cut short. What is called the **spirit** wandering and losing its post does not immediately mean death, for its overseer resides in the head—the **Three Sovereigns** (*sān zūn* 三尊) of high position and **Spiritual Lords** (*líng zhǔ* 灵主) speak of it. The **Supreme One Emperor** (*Tài Yī Dìjūn* 太一帝君) is in the head, at the **Néihuán** (*泥丸*), governing the **spirit**. The **Lord Without Rival** (*Wúyīng Jūn* 无英君) on the left restrains the **Three Souls** (*sān hún* 三魂), and the **White Primordial Lord** (*Bái Yuán Jūn* 白元君) on the right confines the **Seven Spirits** (*qī pò* 七魄). The **Souls** are the **Yang Spirit** (*yáng shén* 阳神), and the **Spirits** are **Yin Ghosts** (*yīn guǐ* 阴鬼). If the **Three Sovereigns** above do not oversee them, the **spirit** departing its post leads to death.\n\nNow, when the **Five Spirits** lose their posts, they also have their overseers. When the **spiritual radiance** does not gather and the **circular radiance** becomes deficient, **evil spirits** assail them. If the **spirit** loses its post, one knows whether a person’s **spirit** prospers or perishes.\n\n「#11 *Earth* (*dì* 地): likely a misreading, should be *„ye”* (*yě* 也), read in conjunction with the preceding text.」",

I wish to hear of its descent—how one may guard against it in advance.\"* (This is about **preventive measures**.) **Qibo** replied: *\"Having understood its ascent, one must necessarily grasp its descent. The **Dao/Way** of ascent and descent can all be treated in advance. One can also needle it before its ascent.*\n\nWhen **Wood** seeks to descend but **Earth**’s **Jing** (**晶**, crystalline) **chamber** obstructs and suppresses it, it descends without entering, and the suppression causes stagnation and eruption. When it disperses, its position can be determined. If it does not descend in three days, it will descend in eight days. When it seeks to descend but stagnation first disperses, then **Earth**’s **Wen** (**问**, questioning) **qi** may emerge. When stagnation erupts during descent, it is sudden like the **Heavenly** **qi** awaiting its time; when it descends but does not descend fully, the stagnation can be swiftly addressed. When descent is not complete, the **qi** erupts rapidly like **Heavenly** stagnation—then it can be needled.\n\nDescending can be achieved by **folding** its **victory** (i.e., its dominant element). **Folding** its **victory** weakens its **standard** (manifestation) while emptying its **root** (source), so it weakens its **victory**. One should needle where **Hand Taiyin** emerges and where **Hand Yangming** enters.\n\nWhere **Hand Taiyin** emerges is the **Shaochang** (**少商**) point, located on the inner side of the thumb’s tip, one **cun** (of the patient’s body measurement) from the nail like the length of a **chive leaf**. It is the **well** of **Hand Taiyin**. Needling should reach one **cun**, retaining the needle for two breaths, then withdrawing swiftly.\n\nWhere **Hand Yangming** enters is the **Quchai** (**曲池**) point, located below the outer knee’s medial condyle, in the depression between the two bones when the elbow is flexed. It is the **convergence** of **Hand Yangming**. Needling should reach one and a half **cun**, retaining the needle for seven breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds.\n\nWhen **Fire** seeks to descend but **Earth**’s **Xuan** (**玄**, mysterious) **chamber** obstructs and suppresses it, it descends without entering, and the suppression causes stagnation and eruption. When it disperses, it can enter. If it does not descend in two days, it will descend in seven days. When it seeks to descend but stagnation disperses, it can be needled swiftly. One should **fold** its **victory** to disperse the stagnation. **Fire**’s stagnation can be **folded** by **Water**—this can remove it.\n\nOne should needle where **Foot Shaoyin** emerges and where **Foot Taiyang** enters. Where **Foot Shaoyin** emerges is the **Yongquan** (**涌泉**) point, located in the depression at the sole’s center, where the toes curl inward when the foot is flexed. It is the **well** of **Foot Shaoyin**. Needling should reach three **cun**, retaining the needle for three breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds, first the left, then the right.\n\nWhere **Foot Taiyang** enters is the **Weizhong** (**委中**) point, located three **cun** below the knee, in the depression outside the **shinbone** (**腑骨**) between the two tendons. It is the **convergence** of **Foot Taiyang**. Needling should reach five **cun**, retaining the needle for seven breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds, first the left, then the right. Repeat this method twice.\n\nWhen **Earth** seeks to descend but **Earth**’s **Cang** (**苍**, azure) **chamber** obstructs and suppresses it, it descends without entering, and the suppression causes stagnation and eruption. When it disperses, it can enter. If it does not descend in five days, it will descend in ten days. When it seeks to descend but stagnation disperses, it can be needled swiftly. One should **fold** its **victory** to disperse the stagnation. **Earth**’s stagnation can be **folded** by **Water**—this can remove its suffering.\n\nOne should needle where **Foot Jueyin** emerges and where **Foot Shaoyang** enters. Where **Foot Jueyin** emerges is the **Dadun** (**大敦**) point, located on the tip of the big toe, one **cun** from the nail like the length of a **chive leaf**, and between the three **hairs** (**三毛**). It is the **well** of **Foot Jueyin**. Needling should reach three **cun**, retaining the needle for ten breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds.\n\nWhere **Foot Shaoyang** enters is the **Yanglingquan** (**阳陵泉**) point, located one **cun** below the knee, in the depression outside the **shinbone** (**腑骨**) between the two tendons. It is the **convergence** of **Foot Shaoyang**. Needling should reach six **cun**, retaining the needle for ten breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds.\n\nWhen **Metal** seeks to descend but **Earth**’s **Tong** (**彤**, vermilion) **chamber** obstructs and suppresses it, it descends without entering, and the suppression causes stagnation and eruption. When it disperses, it can enter. If it does not descend in four days, it will descend in nine days. When it seeks to descend but stagnation disperses, it can be needled swiftly. One should **fold** its **victory** to disperse the stagnation. **Metal**’s stagnation can be **folded** by **Fire**—this can remove it.\n\nOne should needle where **Heart Envelope** (**心包胳**) emerges and where **Hand Shaoyang** enters. Where **Heart Envelope** emerges is the **Zhongchong** (**中冲**) point, located on the tip of the middle finger, one **cun** from the nail like the length of a **chive leaf**. It is the **well** of **Hand Heart Envelope**. Needling should reach one **cun**, retaining the needle for two breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds.\n\nWhere **Hand Shaoyang** enters is the **Tianjing** (**天井**) point, located one **cun** behind the outer elbow bone, in the depression between the two tendons when the elbow is flexed. It is the **convergence** of **Hand Shaoyang**. Needling should reach one **cun**, retaining the needle for ten breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** responds.\n\nWhen **Water** seeks to descend but **Earth**’s **Fu** (**阜**, mound) **chamber** obstructs and suppresses it, it descends without entering, and the suppression causes stagnation and eruption. When it disperses, it can enter. If it does not descend in one day, it will descend in six days. When it seeks to descend but stagnation disperses, it can be needled first. One should **fold** its **victory** (i.e., its dominant element, **Earth**) to disperse the stagnation. **Folding** its **victory** can disperse it.

It is the **convergence** of **Foot Yangming**. Needling should reach five **cun**, retaining the needle for ten breaths, then withdrawing swiftly as the **qi** is raised to its peak.\n\nThe **Emperor** asked: *\"When the Five **Phases** (**运**) arrive, there are sequences of advance and retreat, ascent and descent, and instances where one is suppressed by another. Can I learn the method of needling based on these **transformations**?\"*\n\n**Qibo** replied: *\"One should take its **source of transformation** (**化源**).

      "translated_text": "After three years, the epidemic shifts. Its severity varies—some mild, some extreme—so the timing differs, depending on the depth of the **Heavenly calculations** (*tiān shù* 天數). Examining its mild or extreme nature reveals discrepancies of varying degrees. A major discrepancy (*dà chā* 大差) spans seven *fèn* 分, a minor one (*xiǎo chā* 小差) five *fèn*. Each *fèn* corresponds to fifteen days. A major discrepancy arrives swiftly, while a minor one comes gradually.\n\nA gradual arrival means the epidemic shifts after three years; an extreme arrival means it strikes in the first three years. By calculating the discrepancies and their speed, one knows the **celestial order** (*tiān yùn* 天運) is delayed. One must first **supplement the Heart Shu** (*xīn yǔ* 心俞). The **Heart Shu** is located below the fifth vertebra on the back, one and a half *cùn*寸 from either side. Use a **round, sharp needle** (*yuán lì zhēn* 圓利針), warmed in the mouth at midday. Next, press the point with the hand until the **qi** (*qì* 氣) moves, then recite the incantation three times:\n*\"Tàishǐ Shàngqīng* (太始上清), *Dān Yuán Shǒu Líng* (丹元守靈).\nFirst visualize firelight at the point below, then insert the needle to a depth of one *cùn* to one and a half *cùn* of the patient’s body, retaining it for seven breaths. When the **qi** arrives, advance the needle three *fèn* 分. Tap the needle with the hand to guide the **qi** downward before insertion, then withdraw it slowly once the **qi** moves. Next, palpate the point while the patient holds their breath for three inhalations and swallows.\n\nOn the fifth day, needle the **Kidney’s entry point** (*shèn zhī suǒ rù* 腎之所入), the **Yin Valley** (*yīn gǔ* 陰谷) point, located behind the medial condyle of the femur, beneath the large tendon and above the small one. Pressing it should yield a response; it is found when the knee is flexed. Use a **round, sharp needle**, warmed in the mouth. Press the point first, then recite:\n*\"Dà Wēi Dìjūn* (大微帝君), *wǔ qì jí zhēn* (五氣及真), *liù xīn dōu sī* (六辛都司), *fú fú hēi yún* (符扶黑雲).\nRecite once, then insert the needle to a depth of four *fèn* of the patient’s body *cùn*, withdrawing it quickly once the **qi** moves.\n\nAdditionally, for **lower positions of Earth** (*xià wèi dì jiǎzǐ* 下位地甲子), such as **Sin-Yi** (*xīn yǐ* 辛巳) where **yielding yin** (*róu* 柔) does not align with **just yang** (*gāng* 剛), it is also called **losing its proper place** (*shī gǔ* 失守). This means the **Earthly order** (*dì yùn* 地運) is entirely **empty** (*xū* 虚), and after three years, the epidemic shifts to **water pestilence** (*shuǐ lì* 水疠). The needling methods are the same.\n\nFor example, in **Geng-Chen** (*gēng chén* 庚辰), where **just yang** (*gāng* 剛) and **yielding yin** (*róu* 柔) lose their proper alignment, **Yi** (乙) holds its position, while **Geng** (庚) loses its place above—this is called **yielding yin losing its proper alignment with just yang** (*róu shī qí gāng* 柔失其剛). Though **Yi** holds the year, **Geng** does not occupy the central position, while **Yi** holds the lower position. **Earth’s governance** (*dì zhì* 地治) is thus disrupted. The upper position of **Geng** loses its **just yang** (*gāng gàn* 剛幹), so the **central metal order** (*zhōng jīn yùn* 中金運) does not overreach; instead, it suffers **fire’s victory** (*huǒ shèng* 火勝). When the upper position loses its alignment, the lower position lacks harmony. **Yi-Wei** (乙未) governs the lower position in isolation, lacking the upper **just yang**’s alignment. Thus, the **celestial order** is empty. **Yi-Geng** (乙庚) represents the **metal order** (*jīn yùn* 金運), which does not correspond to mutual attraction. When upper and lower positions attract each other, **yin** and **yang** harmonize.\n\nThe **Heavenly governance** (*sī tiān* 司天) and **Earthly order** (*yùn* 運) each attain their transformations. **Earth’s victory** (*tǔ zhèng* 布正) has not yet retreated, while the **central order** (*zhōng yùn* 中運) arrives in victory. Since the **original yang year** (*yáng nián yuán shèng* 陽年元勝) does not repeat, the **supporting stems and branches** (*zhī gàn* 支幹) lack alignment. When upper and lower positions misalign, it is called **losing its proper place** (*shī gǔ* 失守). **Geng** (庚) does not align with **Yi** (乙). The **Gu-Xi** (姑洗) and **Lin-Zhong** (林鍾) pipes fail to resonate with **Shang** (商) tones. **Losing its proper place** means the same tones do not harmonize: **Gu-Xi**, the upper pipe for **Geng-Chen** (庚辰), does not resonate with the **great Shang** (太商); **Lin-Zhong**, the lower pipe for **Yi-Wei** (乙未), resonates only with the **minor Shang** (少商).\n\nThus, the **transformations of the celestial order** (*tiān yùn huà* 天運化) shift.",
      "overlap_context": "* (*róu gàn* 柔幹) arrives, and the **Lü** (吕) tone has a corresponding resonance, yet the **‘just yang’** (*gāng gàn* 剛幹) has not yet shifted, and the **Yue** (律) pipes emit no sound—this is akin to the **minor羽** (*shǎo yǔ* 少羽) producing a **murmur** (*mǎ xiǎng* 呵響), while the **major羽** (*dà yǔ* 大羽) remains **silent** (*kǒu□#8* 口□#8). Thus, the **celestial order** (*tiān yùn* 天運) is disrupted.\n\nThough there may be transformations, they are not the **constant transformations** (*cháng huà* 常化).」",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the **Four Seasons** (*sì xù* 四序) are not in harmony.\n\nThree years bring about a **great epidemic** (*dà yì* 大疫). The **Metal Epidemic** (*jīn yì* 金疫), also called the **Killing Epidemic** (*shā yì* 杀疫), varies in severity according to its **celestial order** (*tiān shù* 天数). When the **great disparity** (*dà chà* 大差) reaches seven **fen** (分), the **qi** (*qì* 气) lingers beyond **one hundred and fifty days** (*yī bǎi wǔ rì* 一百五日), it is then at its **most severe** (*shèn* 甚). When the **small disparity** (*xiǎo chà* 小差) reaches five **fen**, the **qi** lingers beyond **seventy-five days** (*qī shí wǔ rì* 七十五日), it is then **less severe** (*wēi* 微). **Less severe** (*wēi*) means gradual, appearing over three years. **Most severe** (*shèn*) means swift, appearing within three years.\n\nWhen the **celestial order** (*tiān yùn* 天运) is **losing its proper place** (*shī gǔ* 失守) in the **Gu-Xi** (姑洗) and **Lin-Zhong** (林钟) pipes, as in the case of **Yi-Wei** (乙未) and **Geng-Chen** (庚辰), the **Metal Epidemic** (*jīn yì*) arises, also named the **Killing Epidemic** (*shā yì*). Its arrival depends on the **earthly order** (*dì shù* 地数) and the **disparity** (*chà* 差) of the **celestial order**. One must also calculate its **gradual or swift** (*wēi shèn* 微甚) nature. If it arrives swiftly, it will manifest within three years; if delayed, it will appear after three years. Its coming is akin to that of the **Metal Epidemic** (*jīn yì*), and the acupuncture method is the same as before.\n\nIn all cases where **Yi** (乙) and **Geng** (庚) **lose their proper place** (*shī gǔ*), the acupuncture method remains identical. This is because, though the **transformations of the celestial order** (*tiān yùn huà* 天运化) differ, the **Metal Killing Epidemic** (*jīn shā yì* 金杀疫) and the **people’s diseases** (*mín bìng* 民病) are the same in nature. The treatment must be applied accordingly to **ward off** (*què* 却) the illness.\n\nTo **calm the Liver** (*chéng yù* 肝欲平), one must avoid **anger** (*nù* 怒). If anger arises, the **yin** (*yīn* 阴) will manifest, and since the Liver governs the **intestinal spirit** (*cháng shén* 肠神), the **yin** will disrupt the **yang** (*yáng* 陽) and **arcane spirit** (*yāo* 夭). At night, one should **soothe the mind** (*ān qì zhī yì* 安其志), avoiding recitation of **harsh words** (*è yǔ* 恶语), so that the **yang spirit** (*yáng shén* 陽神) and **arcane spirit** (*yāo* 夭) may remain in the **center** (*zhōng* 中).\n\nFor instance, in the case of **Renshen** (壬申) where **yang-yin** (*gāng róu* 剛柔) **lose their proper place** (*shī gǔ*), the lower **celestial order** (*xià* 下) aligns with its **proper place** (*wèi* 位), while the upper **celestial order** (*shàng* 上) **loses its proper place** (*shī gǔ*). Thus, the **celestial order** (*sī tiān* 司天) aligns with **orthodoxity** (*bù zhèng* 布正), while the **Wood Season** (*mù yùn* 木运) **lacks its proper support** (*fǎn xū* 反虚). Though the years intersect, the **celestial order** (*tiān* 天) has not yet **shifted to its proper place** (*yí zhèng* 迁正), the **supporting season** (*zhōng yùn* 中运) will manifest in the **earthly order** (*dì* 地) at **Ding-You** (丁酉), **solely governing** (*dú zhǔ qí yùn* 独主其运) the **season**. Thus, its **dryness** (*zào* 燥) **prevails over** (*shèng* 胜) the **celestial order** before the **heat transformation** (*rè huà* 热化) occurs; this is called the **double lack** (*èr xū* 二虚).\n\nIf the upper **celestial order** (*shàng* 上) **Renshen** (壬申) **shifts to its proper place** (*yí zhèng*), and the lower **celestial order** (*xià* 下) **Ding** (丁) **stands alone** (*dú rán* 独然), then even though it is a **yang year** (*yáng nián* 陽年), the **disparity** (*kuī* 亏) and **alignment** (*jí* 及) will differ. The **epidemic** (*zāi* 灾) will follow suit.\n\nWithin three days, the Liver will **manifest disease** (*zì bìng* 自病), and the **Wind Transformation** (*fēng huà* 风化) will not be permitted. The **season** (*yùn* 运) will **lose its proper place** (*shī* 失) with **Renshen** (壬申), and **Yi-Wei** (乙未) will not obtain its **proper place**. If the **celestial order** (*tiān* 天) **aligns with its proper place** (*fù wèi* 复位), it will **shift to its proper place** (*yí zhèng* 迁正) without delay, and the **angle** (*jiǎo* 角) will not **misalign** (*bù jiǎ* 不假).\n\nWhen the upper and lower **celestial orders** **lose their proper place** (*shī gǔ*), they **reciprocally call forth** (*xiāng zhāo* 相招) in a set **period** (*qī* 期). Calculating this through **celestial divisions** (*tiān bié* 天别) and **fen** (分), if the **celestial order** (*tiān* 天) **returns to its proper place** (*fù wèi*), it will **reciprocally call forth** (*dé xiāng zhāo* 得相招). The **gradual or swift** (*wēi shèn*) nature of the **disparity** (*chà* 差) has its own **fixed numbers** (*qí shù* 其数). A **disparity** of seven **fen** means a **period** of one hundred and fifty days, the **great disparity** (*dà chà* 大差). A **disparity** of five **fen** means seventy-five days, and the **lower disparity** (*qí xià* 其下) is even more **gradual**.\n\nThe **Lü** (律) and **Lǘ** (吕) pipes, the **two angles** (*èr jiǎo* 二角), **lose their resonance** (*shī* 失) and do not harmonize. Though they share the same **tone** (*yīn* 音), their **resonance** (*yìng* 应) differs. The upper **Lü** (律) pipe, **Luobin** (萝宾), and the lower **Lǘ** (吕) pipe, **Nanlü** (南吕), do not resonate with the **great angle** (*dà jiǎo* 大角), but the **minor angle** (*shǎo jiǎo* 少角) does. Thus, the **two angles** **lose their resonance** (*shī yìng* 失应) and do not harmonize.\n\nOn the day when **Renshen** (壬申) **shifts to its proper place** (*yí zhèng*), the upper and lower **angles** (*jiǎo* 角) will **reciprocally call forth** (*xiāng yìng* 相应) in harmony. Their **gradual or swift** (*wēi shèn*) nature will be as observed, and within three years, a **great epidemic** (*dà yì* 大疫) will arise. If it is **gradual** (*wēi* 微), it will arrive at **Yǐ-You** (乙酉); if **swift** (*shèn* 甚), it will arrive at **Jiǎ-Shēn** (甲申). **Swift** means rapid, **gradual** means slow.\n\nOne should then **acupuncture the Spleen’s point** (*pí zhī yù* 脾之俞). The **Spleen’s point** (*pí zhī yù*) is located beneath the **eleventh vertebra** (*shí yī zhuī* 第十一椎) on the back, one and a half **cun** (寸) on either side, where the **dynamic response** (*dòng tún* 动豚) is felt under the hand. Using a **round and sharp needle** (*yuán lì zhēn* 圆利针), warmed in the mouth, one first **presses the point** (*àn xué* 按穴) with the left hand, then **recites the incantation** (*sòng zhòu* 诵咒):\n\n\"Great **origin** (*tài shǐ* 太始) and **true essence** (*shàng zhēn* 上真),\nFive **symbols** (*wǔ fú* 五符) of the **Celestial Lord** (*dì jūn* 帝君),\n**Original harmony** (*yuán hé* 元和) and **qi** (*qì*) **united** (*qì hé* 气合),\n**Celestial order** (*dì fú* 帝符) **enters its divine domain** (*sī rù qí shén* 司入其神).\n\nReciting this three times, one **acupunctures** (*zhēn* 刺) to a depth of three **cun** (分) equal to the **body’s inch** (*tóng shēn cùn* 同身寸), retains the needle for two **breaths** (*èr hū* 二呼), and withdraws it **gradually** (*xú xú* 徐徐) once the **dynamic qi** (*dòng qì* 动气) is felt. One then **presses the point** (*fú xué* 扪穴) with the hand and instructs the patient to **swallow** (*yàn jīng* 咽津) three times.\n\nOn the third day, one may **acupuncture the point where the Liver’s qi emerges** (*chéng zhī suǒ chū* 肝之所出), which is the **Great Metropolis** (*dà dūn xué* 大敦穴), located at the end of the **big toe** (*dà zǐ* 大趾), near the **nail** (*zǐ jiǎ* 爪甲) like **chive leaves** (*rú jiǔ yè* 如韭叶), and among the **three hairs** (*sān máo* 三毛), belonging to the **Jing-well** (*jǐng* 井) of the **Foot Jueyin** (*zú jié yīn* 足厥阴) **meridian**.\n\nUsing a **round and sharp needle** (*yuán lì zhēn*), warmed in the mouth, one **recites the incantation** (*sòng zhòu*):\n\n\"True **essence** (*zhēn* 真) **reaches the Mysterious** (*dá dào míng rán* 大道冥然),\nThe **Five Spirits** (*wǔ shén* 五神) each in their **proper place** (*gè wèi* 各位),\n**Qi** (*qì*) **deficit in the Three Fields** (*qì quē sān tián* 气缺三田).\n\nAfter reciting this, one may **acupuncture** (*zhēn* 刺) to a depth of three **cun** (分) equal to the **body’s inch**, retain the needle for ten **breaths** (*shí hū* 十呼), and withdraw it once the **dynamic qi** (*dòng qì*) is felt.\n\nAfter the **acupuncture** (*zhēn* 刺) is complete, one should **quiet the spirit** (*jìng shén* 静神) for seven days. Avoid **excessive drinking** (*dà zuì* 大醉), **singing and merrymaking** (*gē lè* 歌乐), as these actions will **scatter the qi** (*sàn qì* 气散). Avoid **overindulging in food** (*bǎo shí* 饱食), and do not consume **raw foods** (*shēng wù* 生物). **Singing and merrymaking** will **stir the Spleen’s spirit** (*pí shén dòng* 脾神动) and **scatter the qi**. **Excessive drinking** will **disrupt the nature** (*xìng luàn* 性乱), and **overindulging in food** will cause **food stagnation** (*shí zhǎng* 食胀), hence the caution.\n\nTo **strengthen the Spleen** (*shí pí* 脾实) and **ensure free flow of qi** (*qì wú zhì* 气无滞), one should avoid **prolonged sitting after meals** (*cháng zuò* 久坐), **excessively sour foods** (*dà suān* 大酸), and **all raw foods** (*yī qiè shēng wù* 一切生物). **Sweet and mild** (*gān yí* 甘宜) foods are preferred. **Mild** (*tán* 淡) foods **enter the stomach** (*rù wèi* 入胃) and are **beneficial to the Spleen** (*yí yì fǔ* 宜益府). **Mildness** (*tán* 淡) refers to the **Earth’s subtle flavor** (*tǔ zhī bó wèi* 土之薄味), which is **secondary to sweetness** (*èr cì yú gān* 而又次於甘).",

      "translated_text": "---\n\n**On Nurturing the Spleen and the Five Epidemics**\n\nDo not sit idly, nor remain outdoors for long—this is how one nurtures the Spleen.\n\nIf, moreover, the **Earthly Branch** *jiǎzǐ* (甲子) lies beneath the earth, or if **Ding-Yǒu** (丁酉) loses its proper position, failing to secure the **Central Authority** (*zhōng sī* 中司), then the **qi** will not occupy its rightful place. If **Ding** (丁) does not align with **Rén** (壬) in mutual support, this is also called **losing its position** (*shī shǒu* 失守), not **harmonious virtue** (*hé dé* 合德). Thus, the yielding fails to adhere to the firm.\n\nWhen the **Heavenly and Earthly Branches** *jiǎzǐ* (二甲子) do not mutually correspond above and below, **Yin and Yang** become disordered, and thus the **Central Cycle** loses its regular governance of the **Yearly Harmonies** (*suì hé* 岁合之常政). If the **Earthly Cycle** fails to align, **three years of plague** (*biàn lì* 变疠) ensue. This is called **Wood Epidemic** (*mù yì* 名木疠) or **Wind Epidemic** (*fēng lì* 风疠). When it arrives, its severity can be inferred from its subtle signs. The method of acupuncture follows that of **Wood Plague** (*mù yì* 木疫). For all cases where **Ding and Rén** lose their positions above and below, the same method is applied.\n\nFor instance, if **Wu-Shēn** (戊申) loses its firm-yielding alignment—**Wu** (戊) should harmonize with **Guǐ** (癸)—then the **Heavenly and Earthly Branches** *jiǎzǐ* (二甲子) would ideally align **Wu-Shēn** (戊申) with **Guǐ-Hài** (癸亥). If **Guǐ-Hài** (癸亥) descends to Earth, it governs the **Earthly Authority** (*dì zhèng sī* 地正司). However, **Wu-Shēn** (戊申) exceeds **Ding-Wèi** (丁未), and since **Heaven’s count** (*tiān shù* 天数) has not yet retreated but instead spreads anew, it **loses its position** (*shī shǒu*). Thus, **Wu and Guǐ** do not harmonize. Though **Wu-Guǐ** (戊癸) belong to the **Fire Cycle** (*huǒ yùn* 火运), the **Yang Year** does not become excessive. **Wu-Wèi** (戊未) governs its proper authority, while **Guǐ** (癸) governs alone below, so it is not excessive—rather, it suffers **Water’s dominance** (*shòu shuǐ shèng* 受水胜). The **Heavenly Branch** loses its firmness, and the yielding **qi** becomes ungoverned, giving rise to **pathogenic intrusion** (*xié gàn* 邪干). If **Water Cycle** loses its position above, the **Middle and Lower Cycles** suffer deficiency, so **Heaven becomes void** (*tiān xū* 天虚) while **Earth still governs**. When the **Fire Cycle** appears in the Middle, **Water** invades it, hence the term **pathogenic intrusion**. The shifts in position vary in depth, and if **Heaven’s count** (*tiān shù*) exceeds its due measure, the imbalance may be slight or great. Yet if they eventually align in mutual support, the harmony depends on the **lunar count** (*yuè shù* 月数). When they are about to harmonize, their **musical tones** (*yīn lǜ* 音律) first resonate in unison—a sign of the **Fire Cycle’s** advance. The **Heavenly and Earthly musical scales** (*èr lǜ lǘ* 上下律吕) exhaust the **Great and Lesser Overtures** (*tài shǎo èr zhēng* 太少二征), and their harmonized tones converge. Thus, when **Heaven’s Cycle** is untimely, within three years, the **Fire Epidemic** (*huǒ yì* 火疫) arrives. It may come swiftly by **Gēng-Xū** (庚戌) or gradually by **Xīn-Hài** (辛亥). One must then **acupunct the Lung’s Back-Shu point** (*fèi shù* 肺俞).\n\nThe **Lung’s Back-Shu point** (*fèi shù*) lies below the **third vertebra** (*dì sān zhuī* 第三椎), one and a half *cùn* on either side, where the pulse responds to pressure. Use a **sharp, round needle**, warmed in the mouth. First, press the point with the hand, then insert the needle to a depth of **two *fēn*** (*èr fēn* 二分). Recite the incantation three times:\n\n*\"True and False Qi contend in struggle,\nQi infuses the Original Spirit,\nThe Imperial Symbol returns to its root,\nPositions align with their kin.\"*\n\nWhen the **qi** is about to arrive, visualize **white radiance** (*bái xī* 白熙) beneath the point. Insert another *fēn*, then withdraw the needle slowly as the **qi** arrives, pressing the point with the hand. The ailment may then be cured immediately. After acupuncture, maintain **mental tranquility for seven days**, avoiding **excessive grief**. Grief agitates the Lung, causing the **True Qi** to disperse once more.\n\nIn all things—**joy, anger, sorrow, delight, and fear**—one must not overindulge. These five emotions can **disturb Heaven** and **scatter the Original Spirit** (*luàn zhēn shén* 乱真神). Thus, the Sage **abandons idle thoughts** and **stills the mind**, preserving the Spirit. When the Spirit governs the form, the form remains whole, ensuring **bodily ease** and **eternal Dao**.\n\nTo **strengthen the Lung** (*shí fèi* 肺实), one must **regulate the breath** (*xī qì* 息气). Avoid **heavy panting**, excessive speech, or **prolonged breathing**. Do not speak or breathe too much, nor consume **salty, cold foods** (*xián shí* 咸食) in excess. **Grief, anger, and sorrow** are especially forbidden, as they **injure the Lung’s Spirit** (*shāng fèi shén* 伤肺神).\n\nIf, moreover, the **Earthly Branch** *jiǎzǐ* (甲子) lies beneath, and **Guǐ-Hài** (癸亥) loses its position, this is when the **yielding loses its place** (*róu shī shǒu wèi* 柔失守位), and the **Heavenly Branch** loses its firmness (*shàng shī qí gāng* 上失其刚). This is also called **\"Wu and Guǐ failing to harmonize in virtue\"** (*wù guǐ bù xiāng hé dé* 戊癸不相合德). When the **Cycle aligns with the void Earth**, three years later, **Fire Plague** (*huǒ lì* 火疠) emerges—akin to **Fire Epidemic** (*huǒ yì*). The treatment follows the same method. For all cases involving **Wu** (戊) and **Guǐ** (癸) losing their positions above and below, the approach is identical.\n\nThus, when the **Earthly Cycle** is established for five years, one must discern **losing its position** and apply the **Wetness Method** (*shī fǎ* 湿法) in acupuncture. **Epidemic** (*yì*) and **Plague** (*lì*) refer to the **disorder of firm-yielding above and below**, ultimately converging into one principle.\n\nThe **acupuncture method for Epidemics** consists of **five techniques**, summarizing all cases of **positional loss**, thus unifying them under the **Five Phases**. These are the **Five Epidemics and Plagues**, arising from **Heaven and Earth’s disharmonious qi**, transforming into **Epidemics and Plagues** that gravely harm human life. Thus, understanding **Heaven’s Primordial Principle** (*tiān yuán* 天元) allows one to **transmit the acupuncture method**, thereby **saving the people**.\n\n---\n*(End of *Huángdì Nèijīng Sūwèn Yípiān* [Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon: Lost Tracts], Volume II)*\n\n---\n*(Begin *Huángdì Nèijīng Sūwèn Yípiān* [Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon: Lost Tracts], Volume III: Treatise on Acupuncture Methods, Part II)*",

      "translated_text": "「The Yellow Emperor asked: *\"I have heard that when the Five Epidemics and Plagues arrive, they all spread easily among one another, regardless of whether the afflicted are great or small, their symptoms being alike. If one applies #1[**prophylactic measures**] to prevent transmission, how can one ensure that none are affected? When their diseases overlap and cling to one another, how can one avoid being infected?\"*\n\nQìbó replied: *\"Those who avoid infection retain their **Heavenly Vitality** (*zhèngqì* 正氣) within. The **Pathogenic Qi** cannot assail them. They evade the **Toxic Qi** (*dúqì* 毒氣), and as **Heaven’s nurturing principle** (*tiān pì* 天牝) returns, they regain their **Dao/Way** (*wǎng* 往). The **Toxic Qi** of the Epidemics lies in **excessive sweating** (*xièhàn* 泄汗). If one instead **induces downward elimination** (*fǎnxià qǔzhī* 反下取之), the Qi enters the body’s core, and the **Toxic Qi** reaches the brain, flowing into all the **Channels** (*jīng* 經), causing people to contract the disease.\n\nFor instance, when a person sneezes, this Qi enters through the nose into the brain. To prevent it from lingering in the nostrils, one should **direct the sneeze outward** (*ràng xǔn zhī jí chū* 令嚏之即出爾), thus avoiding infection. When the Qi exits the brain, the **Heavenly Vitality** remains intact, and the mind **guards its root** (*shén shǒu qí běn* 神守其本) like the sun. Then, the **Toxic Qi** of the Epidemics cannot harm them.\n\nBefore entering the **Epidemic Chamber** (*yìshì* 疫室), one must first **visualize the Liver’s Green Qi** (*qīngqì* 青氣) emerging from the liver, moving leftward to the **East** (*shù* 束), transforming into **forests and trees** (*línmù* 林木), like the **verdant cypress of spring**. Next, **visualize the Lung’s White Qi** (*báiqì* 白氣) emerging from the lungs, moving rightward to the **West** (*xī* 西), transforming into **weapons and armor** (*gējiǎ* 戈甲), like the **sharp, gleaming blades** of swords and spears. Then, **visualize the Heart’s Red Qi** (*chìqì* 赤氣) emerging from the heart, moving southward upward, transforming into **flames** (*yànmíng* 焰明), like the **intense, scorching heat** of summer. Next, **visualize the Kidney’s Black Qi** (*hēiqì* 黑氣) emerging from the kidneys, moving northward downward, transforming into **water** (*shuǐ* 水), like the **dark waves** of the sea. Finally, **visualize the Spleen’s Yellow Qi** (*huángqì* 黄氣) emerging from the spleen, residing in the center, transforming into **earth** (*tǔ* 土), like the **vast, yellow expanse** of the land. When the **Five Qi** (*wǔqì* 五氣) have fully **shielded the body** (*hùshēn* 护身), one should **visualize the brilliance of the Northern Dipper** (*běidǒu* 北斗) above the head. Only then can one safely enter the Epidemic Chamber, ensuring that the **Heavenly Vitality** remains intact and the **Pathogenic Qi** of the Epidemics cannot assail.\n\nAnother method: On the day of the **Spring Equinox** (*chūnfēn* 春分), before the sun rises, one should **expectorate** (*tǔ* 吐). Using **far-reaching farzhi** (*yuǎnzhì* 远志, *farzhi* 远志) with its heart removed, decocted in water, and consumed in two cups, then **expectorating**, one can avoid the Epidemics.\n\nAnother method: After the **Rain Water** (*yǔshuǐ* 雨水) solar term, on three consecutive days of **bathing with medicinal herbs** (*yàohàn* 药浴), one should **induce sweating** (*xièhàn* 泄汗). If the sweat is **foul-smelling** (*chòu* 臭), it indicates the Epidemics have been **expelled** (*wúyì* 无疫).\n\nAnother method: The **Minor Golden Elixir Formula** (*xiǎojīndān fāng* 小金丹方):\nTwo *liǎng* (两) of **Cinnabar** (*chénshā* 辰砂),\nOne *liǎng* (两) of **Realgar** (*xiōnghuáng* 雄黄), ground with water,\nOne *liǎng* (两) of **Female Realgar** (*qícǐ zhīhuáng* 雌黄, *qícǐ* 雌黄), ground with water,\nHalf a *liǎng* (两) of **Purple Gold** (*zǐjīn* 紫金).\nGrind into fine powder (*fěn zuò mò* 粉作末), ensuring it is **refined** (*lìng xì* 令细).\nCombine in a **fusion vessel** (*hé* 合), seal it externally, and **bury it one *chǐ* (尺) deep**, compacting the earth firmly around it. Do not use a furnace or require **pharmaceutical processing** (*yàozhì* 药制). Instead, **use twenty *jīn* (斤) of fire** to **melt and refine** (*duàn* 缎) it for seven days. Always maintain the fire at twenty *jīn* (斤).\n\nOn the seventh day, when the **bell-like resonance** (*líng* 玲) is heard, dig up the vessel the next day and **bury the medicine in the earth for seven days**. A **auspicious location** (*jí dì* 吉地) is preferable.\n\nAfter retrieving it, **grind it in accordance with the sun’s path** (*shùnrì yán* 顺日研) for three days. Form pills with **white sand and honey** (*báishā mì* 白沙蜜), each as large as a **Chinese parasol tree seed** (*wútóngzǐ* 梧桐子). Daily, facing the **East** (*shù* 束), inhale the **Qi of the Sun’s Radiance** (*rìhuágì* 日华气) once, swallow a pill with **iced water**, and **harmonize the Qi** before gulping it down. After ingesting ten pills, the **Pathogenic Qi** will no longer assail.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"When a person’s **Heavenly Vitality** is depleted, their **spirit** (*shén* 神) wanders and loses its position, allowing **external pathogenic influences** (*guǐshén wàigàn* 鬼神外干) to intrude, leading to premature death. How can one preserve the **True Essence** (*quánzhēn* 全真) and avoid this? I wish to hear the **acupuncture method** (*cìfǎ* 刺法).\"*\n\nQìbó bowed twice and replied: *\"Illuminating is your question! When the **spirit** (*shén* 神) drifts and loses its guard, though it remains within the body, it does not necessarily lead to death. Yet, if **Pathogenic Qi** assails it, then **lifespan is shortened** (*tiāoshòu* 夭寿). If the **Pathogenic Qi** has not yet assailed, there is no illness. But when it is about to assail, **premature death** may occur.\n\nFor example, if the **Liver’s Minor Yin** (*gèyīn* 厥阴) loses its guard, **Heaven’s nurturing principle** (*tiān pì* 天牝) becomes **vacant** (*xū* 虚), and the **human Qi** (*rénqì* 人氣) of the liver becomes **depleted** (*xū* 虚), compounding with the **Heavenly Vacancy** (*tiān xū* 天虚). The **soul** (*hún* 魂) then **wanders upward** (*yóushàng* 游於上). When the liver is **depleted** (*xū* 虚), **Heaven is vacant** (*xū* 虚), and one **sweats excessively** (*chūhàn* 出汗) in the liver region, resulting in **triple depletion** (*sān xū* 三虚), the **spirit** (*shén* 神) scatters and wanders to the upper regions. If the **Left Side’s Guardian Spirit** (*yīngjūn* 英君) does not descend, the **spiritual light** (*shén guāng* 神光) fails to gather, and the **Black Corpse Ghost** (*bái shī guǐ* 白尸鬼) invades, causing **premature death**.\n\nIf the **Pathogenic Qi** assails the **Major Qi** (*dàqì* 大氣), the body **may still be treatable** (*yǒukě cìzhī* 可刺之). When the **spiritual luster** (*shén cǎi* 神彩) remains in the eyes, though the **limbs are cold** (*sìzhī líng* 四肢玲), the **chest and abdomen are still warm** (*xīnfù shàng wēn* 心腹尚温), and the **tongue** (*shé* 舌) is **not retracted** (*bù juǎnsuō* 不卵缩), this is not **Minor Yin’s loss** (*bù gǎn gèyīn* 非感厥), and it is called **Corpse Cold** (*shī jué* 尸厥). Thus, it can be **revived** (*fǔsū* 复苏).\n\n**Puncture the Foot Minor Yang Channel** (*zú shǎoyáng jīng* 足少阳之所过), which passes through the **Hill Mound Hole** (*qiūxū* 丘墟) located below the **external ankle** (*zúwàiì* 足外踝下), in the **concave depression** (*rú qián èn* 如前陷者中), five *cùn* (寸) from the **Tear Point** (*línqì* 临泣), the **origin of the Foot Minor Yang** (*zú shǎoyáng zhī yuán* 足少阳之原). Use a **fine needle** (*háo zhēn* 毫针), warming it near the body until it is **comfortably warm** (*jìn wēn* 暖针至温). With the left hand pressing the point, recite the incantation: *\"**Supreme Primordial Lord** (*tàishàng yuánjūn* 太上元君), who **dwells perpetually on the left**, commands the **Three Souls** (*sān hún* 三魂).\"* Chant three times, then call out the names of the **Three Souls** (*sān hún míng* 三魂名): **Vital Spirit** (*cuànglíng* 爽灵), **Fetal Light** (*tāiguāng* 胎光), **Mysterious Essence** (*yōujīng* 幽精). Chant three times more, then **visualize the Green Dragon** (*qīnglóng* 青龙) beneath the point. Puncture to a depth of three *fēn* (分) of the **same-body inch** (*tóngshēncùn* 同身寸), retain for three breaths, then **gradually withdraw the needle**. Press where the patient feels **Qi** (*ànqì* 按气) at the mouth, and if there is a **gurgling sound** (*wū* 呜) in the abdomen, treatment is successful.\n\nNext, **puncture the Liver’s Back-Shu Point** (*gān zhī yù* 肝之俞), located below the **ninth vertebra** (*dì jiǔ zhuī* 第九椎下), one and a half *cùn* (寸) on either side. Use a **fine needle**, warming it until the body feels **comfortably warm**. With the left hand pressing the point, recite the incantation: *\"**Lord of the Great Mystery** (*tàiwēi dìjūn* 太微帝君), **Primordial Guardian** (*yuán yīng zhìhún* 元英制魂), **True Primordial Essence** (*zhēnyuán jíběn* 真元及本) enters the **Azure Clouds** (*qīngyún* 青云).\"* Again call out the **Three Souls’ names** as before, three times. Puncture to a depth of three *fēn* (分) of the **same-body inch**, retain for three breaths; then advance two *fēn* (分) more, retain for three breaths; finally, withdraw the needle to three *fēn* (分) and retain for one breath, then **gradually remove it**. The **Qi** will then **reach its target**, and the patient will **revive**.\n\nWhen a person’s **Heart is depleted** (*xīn xū* 心虚), and they additionally encounter the **Heavenly Fire** (*tiān huǒ* 天火) of the **Celestial Sovereign and Minister** (*jūnxiàng* 君相) losing its guard, leading to **triple depletion** (*sān xū* 三虚). Or if one **sweats excessively** (*chūhàn* 出汗) from the heart, the **spirit and soul** (*shén hún* 神魂) will **reverse and ascend** (*nì shàng* 逆於上), entering the **Filtrum** (*níwán* 泥丸). If the **Heavenly Fire** is **insufficient**, the **Black Corpse Ghost** (*hēi shī guǐ* 黑尸鬼) will invade, causing **sudden death** (*bàowáng* 暴亡).

It is **unyielding and resolute in judgment**, hence its role as the organ of central rectitude. **Direct yet without doubt**, thus decisive judgment arises from it. When **emotions surge and wrath erupts**, wrath that does not cease, *qi* ascends and fails to hold its position, impairing central rectitude, risking **stagnation and choking** (*gěiyè*), with scattered *shén* light—before any evil intrusion, it may be treated with acupuncture. **Needle the source of the foot Shào Yáng**.\n\nThe **source of the foot Shào Yáng** is the **Qiūxū** (Mound Ruins) point, located at the **depression below the lateral malleolus**, five *cùn* from the **Línqì** (Tear Well) point, where the **foot Shào Yáng meridian** passes.

When the heart **retains memory**, it is called *yì* (intent); when *yì* manifests externally, it is called *zhì* (wisdom). Wisdom encompasses all things, arising from *yì* and *zhì*. Thus, **comprehensive knowledge arises from it**, rooted in intent. When **desire and obsession exhaust the mind**, wisdom falters, *shén* light scatters—preventive treatment is possible. **Needle the spleen’s source**.\n\nThe **spleen’s source** lies at the **depression below the medial malleolus**, where the **foot Tài Yīn meridian** passes as the source. Use a **long needle**, warm it in the mouth, first pressing the point with the **left hand**, inserting to **three *fēn***, retaining for **five breaths**; advance to **three *fēn***, retaining for **five breaths**; then withdraw the needle slowly, palpating the point with the hand.\n\nThe **stomach** is the organ of **granaries and defenses**, where the **five flavors** arise. It **encompasses the five grains**, hence its name as the organ of granaries and defenses. Nourishing the **four limbs**, thus the **five flavors arise**.

Thus, it is the organ of transmission, where transformation arises. When **men overindulge**, *shén* loses its position—before evil intrusion, acupuncture restores them. **Needle the large intestine’s source**.\n\nThe **large intestine’s source** is the **Hégǔ** (Union Valley) point, located at the **webbed junction of the index and thumb**, where the **hand Yáng Míng meridian** passes. Use a **long needle**, warm it in the mouth, inserting to **two *fēn***, retaining for **three breaths**; advance to **two *fēn***, retaining for **one breath**; withdraw the needle slowly.\n\nThe **small intestine** is the organ of **reception and refinement**, where **transmutation** arises. It **receives and refines** from the stomach, accepting **waste and essence**, transmitting to the large intestine—thus, it is the organ of reception and refinement, where transmutation arises. When **reception is disrupted**, whether by excess or deficiency, *shén* loses its guard—**preventive acupuncture preserves wholeness**. **Needle the small intestine’s source**.\n\nThe **small intestine’s source** is the **Wàngǔ** (Wrist Bone) point, located at the **depression on the ulnar side of the wrist**, where the **hand Tài Yáng meridian** passes.

In women, it manifests as clever adaptability; in men, as **action-strength**. When **excessive vigor leads to error**, aligning with **critical days of the trigrams and eight directions**, *shén* loses its position—**preventive acupuncture preserves wholeness**. **Needle the kidney’s source**.\n\nThe **kidney’s source** emerges at **Dàxī** (Great Creek), located at the **depression below the medial malleolus**, anterior to the heel bone, where the **foot Shào Yīn meridian** passes as the source.

If they fail to advance upward or downward as they should, this is called **losing one’s station**.\"*\n\nThe *Celestial Element Jade Register* states:\n*\"The six **qi** always have three in Heaven and three on Earth. One **qi** ascends to Heaven as the **Left Intercalary Qi**; one enters Earth as the **Right Intercalary Qi**; one shifts to its proper position as **Celestial Sovereign**; one shifts to its proper position as **Earthly Spring**; one retreats from its position as **Left Celestial Intercalary Qi**; one retreats from its position as **Right Earthly Intercalary Qi**.\"*\n\nWhen **qi exchange** harmonizes, the **qi** naturally occupy their proper positions at the appointed time—this is when Heaven and Earth interact, and all things flourish.

If this transformation is irregular, the four seasons lose their order, and all transformations become unstable—**disease** ensues among the people.\n\nTherefore, among the six **qi**, some fail to ascend when they should, some fail to descend when they should, some fail to shift to their proper positions when they should, and some fail to occupy their proper stations when they should. Such deviations mean Heaven and Earth lose their natural governance, and the people become restless.\n\nThe Emperor said:\n*\"When ascent and descent fail to proceed—how does this occur? How can one discern the variations in **qi exchange**?\"*\n\nHe asked again about tracing the **source** of these changes.\n\nQī Bó replied:\n*\"Your inquiry is clear, and your understanding profound.

Thus, the **Celestial Obstructions** overcome them, and they do not advance.*\n\n*But when **qi** seek to descend and fail to do so, the **Earthly Obstructions** restrain them. **Wood** seeks to descend, but the **Earthly Barrier Obstruction** restrains it; **Fire** seeks to descend, but the **Earthly Dark Obstruction** restrains it; **Earth** seeks to descend, but the **Earthly Azure Obstruction** restrains it; **Metal** seeks to descend, but the **Earthly Vermilion Obstruction** restrains it; **Water** seeks to descend, but the **Earthly Mound Obstruction** restrains it. The nine **Earthly Obstructions** mirror the symbols of Heaven, and the **virtue/power** of the overcoming **qi** prevents descent.*\n\n*Additionally, when the five **phases** exceed their limits and arrive prematurely, **qi exchange** fails to advance. When a **Yang** year encounters its appointed time, after its arrival, the overcoming **qi** does not exceed its bounds.*\n\n*But when **qi** seek to ascend and fail, the intervening **phase** suppresses them. **Wood** seeks to ascend but encounters an excessive **Metal phase** in the intervening cycle; **Fire** seeks to ascend but encounters an excessive **Water phase**; **Earth** seeks to ascend but encounters an excessive **Wood phase**; **Metal** seeks to ascend but encounters an excessive **Fire phase**; **Water** seeks to ascend but encounters an excessive **Earth phase**. All these cases involve the **phase** exceeding its limits, arriving early in the cycle, and preempting **qi exchange**, thus suppressing ascent.*\n\n*But when **qi** seek to descend and fail, the intervening **phase** suppresses them. When the five **phases** exceed their limits and arrive prematurely, descent is hindered, and the intervening **phase** restrains them, preventing progress.*\n\n*Thus, there are cases where ascent fails, descent fails, descent fails while ascent reaches Heaven, or both ascent and descent fail—each variation differs, and the resulting calamities range from mild to severe.*\n\n*Therefore, the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth, the overcoming and restraint of **Celestial Obstructions** and **Earthly Obstructions**, and the shallow or deep suppression by the intervening **phase**—these determine why the people’s **diseases** vary in severity.*\n\nThe Emperor said:\n*\"I wish to understand how the encounters, overcoming, and suppression of **qi exchange** manifest in **disease**, and how their severity differs. I seek to clarify the origins of these disease transformations.\"*\n\nQī Bó replied:\n*\"Overcoming and suppression through encounters produce these effects. The six **qi** ascending and descending follow the established principles of **qi exchange**, which is their constant state. However, when irregular encounters occur and they converge, overcoming and suppression create stagnation.*\n\n*Thus, in years of the *Chén* branch (戊), the **Wood qi** ascends, encountering the **Celestial Pillar**, overcoming it and failing to advance. In years of the *Chén-Xū* combination (辰戌), the **Greater Yang** shifts to its proper position as **Celestial Sovereign**. The **Jué-Yin** acts as **Earthly Spring**, and by this year, it ascends to Heaven as the **Left Intercalary Qi**. Encountering the **Celestial Sovereign**, it is calculated to reach the **Celestial Pillar Obstruction**. **Wood** seeks to ascend, but the **Celestial Pillar Metal** and **Earthly Sovereign** overcome it, preventing progress. Additionally, in years of *Gēng-Xū* (庚戌), the **Metal phase** arrives prematurely, and the intervening **phase** overcomes it, suddenly halting its ascent. In a **Metal year**, the **Metal phase** arrives prematurely, and thirteen days later, **qi exchange** occurs. The **Celestial Sovereign** seeks to ascend, but the intervening **Metal phase** suppresses it.*\n\n*When the **Wood phase** ascends to Heaven, **Metal** suppresses it.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「When the **Celestial Sovereign** (太阳) completes its three-year tenure on Earth, this year it ascends to Heaven, acting as the **left minister of Yangming** (阳明之左问), which is already defined in the *Canon* (经) and *Commentaries* (论). Its ascent to Heaven is accompanied by **Celestial Pillar Obstruction of Nèi** (天内), as the sequential laws dictate. When **Water** encounters **Earth**’s obstruction, it cannot ascend, and though it is subdued, it remains vibrant.\n\nAgain, if it meets **Yangming** (阳明) before it has moved to its proper position—meaning the **Celestial Sovereign** has not yet ascended to Heaven—**Earth**’s influence arrives instead. In **Jǐ-Yǒu** (己酉) and **Jǐ-Mǎo** (己卯) years, **Water** seeks to ascend to Heaven, but **Earth**’s influence suppresses it. Sometimes, one sees **Celestial Pillar Obstruction of Nèi** (天内) suppressing it, or **Earth**’s influence subduing it—either way, there is an imbalance. When it ascends but does not progress, **dampness and heat** (湿而热) steam, giving rise to **twofold cold** (寒生两问). The people suffer from **stagnant *qi*** (郁) that does not disperse, lingering until it becomes prolonged. If it does not descend for **twelve days**, it is considered prolonged.\n\nWhen **cold** arrives as a guest and **heat** prevails, **hail and ice pellets** (冰雹) suddenly descend. The people suffer from **ulcerative cold** (厥逆而秽), where **heat** festers within and **cold *qi*** stagnates without, causing **foot foulness, acidity, and pain** (足腥酸疼). This may also generate **palpitations, restlessness, and heat** (心悸懊热), sudden agitation followed by **ulcerative cold** (而复厥). When **black dust** (一黑埃) rises, leading to **cold epidemic febrile diseases** (寒疫), the people all suffer from **agitation and palpitations** (皆烦而悸厥)—treatment can involve **emesis** (吐).\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor** (黄帝) asked: *\"When it ascends but does not progress, I have already understood its meaning. Now I wish to hear about when it descends but does not descend—can I gain clarity?\"* He sought further elucidation of this **Dao** (道).\n\n**Qī-Bó** (岐伯) replied: *\"Your question is thorough indeed! This is what is called the **subtle interplay of Heaven and Earth** (天地微旨), and through this, the full **Dao** (道) of ascent and descent can be revealed. Just as it is said: 'Ascension must be followed by descent.'*\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign** ascends to Heaven as the **left minister for one year**, then in the **second year** it moves to its proper position as **Sovereign of Heaven** (司天), in the **third year** it retires to become the **right minister** (右问), and by the **fourth year**, it descends. After three years in Heaven, it must descend in the following year. Upon descending into Earth, it begins once more as the **left minister**.\n\nAs the **left minister on Earth for one year**, the next year it becomes **Sovereign of Earth** (司地) in its proper position, and the following year it retires to become the **right minister**. Thus, the cycle of ascent, descent, and return is called the **Six Periods** (六纪).\n\nThree years in Heaven, three years on Earth—if it does not descend in a year, it brings **calamities and disasters** (灾害). First, one must clarify its ascent; then, one must exhaustively explore its descent. Therefore, in **Chǒu-Wèi** (丑未) years, **Celestial Sovereign of Gǔyīn** (厥阴) descends to Earth, obstructing **Earth’s Clarity** (地晶), and though subdued, it does not enter fully.\n\nAgain, if **Gǔyīn** remains in Heaven for three years, the next year it descends, but it also encounters **Earth’s Ninefold Obstruction** (地九窒), where **Earth’s Clarity** (地晶) in the west is blocked by **Jué** (兑), and **Metal** (金) governs its suppression, preventing it from entering its proper domain. When suppressed and unable to enter, it transforms into **diseases among the people** (民病).\n\nSometimes it meets **Shàoyīn** (少阴) before its retreat. **Shàoyīn** has excess influence in Heaven, acting as the **Administrator of Affairs** (布政), and thus has not yet retreated one position. When **Gǔyīn** has not yet descended, **Metal**’s influence arrives in the middle. In **Yǐ-Chǒu** (乙丑) and **Yǐ-Wèi** (乙未) years, one sees **Metal** suppressing it. When **Metal**’s influence follows and suppresses it, the descent does not occur, and the **stagnant *qi*** (郁) lingers, forming **diseases among the people** (民病).\n\nWhen **Wood** seeks to descend, **Metal** follows and suppresses it. If it does not descend, **blue dust** (苍埃) appears from afar, and **white *qi*** (白气) follows, with **wind** lifting the dust into a dim haze. **Clear and restless *qi*** (清躁) then brings **killing energy** (杀), and **frost and dew** descend again, issuing **stern and killing decrees** (肃杀布令). If it lingers and does not descend, the suppressed **stagnant *qi*** (郁) transforms into **diseases among the people**. If it does not descend for **three days** but descends on the **eighth day**, and if it does not descend at all, it will generate **wind epidemic febrile diseases** (风疫). This is when **wind and restless *qi*** (风躁) become stagnant, and **warmth reverses to coldness** (暄而反清). When **grass and trees** begin to sprout, the **killing frost** (杀霜) arrives prematurely, unseen, causing **fear of coldness and injury to the *zàng* organs** (惧清伤藏). The **warmth and harmony of the seasons** (暄和令节) are followed by **great cold and killing energy**, which then issue **killing frost** (布杀霜). When **blue dust** appears, the **wind epidemic febrile diseases** arrive, and treatment can involve **emesis** (吐) to achieve relief—but **descent is then impossible**.\n\nThus, in **Yǐn-Shēn** (寅申) years, **Shàoyīn** descends to Earth, obstructing **Earth’s Mysterious Depths** (地玄), and though subdued, it does not enter fully. After three years in Heaven, **Shàoyīn** descends in the fourth year, but if it encounters **Earth’s Obstruction** (地窒), it governs **Earth’s Mysterious Depths** (地玄), and **Water** obstructs its descent, preventing it from entering. The suppressed **stagnant *qi*** (抑伏) then transforms into **diseases among the people**.\n\nSometimes it meets **Bǐng-Shēn** (丙申) or **Bǐng-Yǐn** (丙寅) years, where **Water**’s influence is excessive, arriving before its proper time. When **Water**’s influence is excessive and arrives in the middle, **Shàoyīn** descends but does not descend fully, forming **stagnant *qi*** (郁) and bringing **calamities to the people** (灾).\n\nWhen the **Sovereign Fire** (君火) seeks to descend, **Water** follows and suppresses it. If it does not descend, **red clouds** (彤云) appear faintly, and **black *qi*** (黑气) emerges in reverse. The warmth spreads like relaxation, but **cold** constantly issues **spiritual decrees** (布灵), and **piercing cold** (凛冽) returns. The **Heavenly clouds** (天云) grow dark and continuous. If it lingers and does not descend, the suppressed **stagnant *qi*** (伏) transforms into **diseases among the people**. If it does not descend for **two days** but descends on the **seventh day**, and if it does not descend at all, the **stagnant *qi*** (郁) will erupt. **Cold** overpowers and **heat** returns, generating **red wind epidemic febrile diseases** (赤风化疫), where the people suffer from **flushed faces, agitated hearts, headaches, and dizziness** (面赤心烦，头痛目眩). The **red *qi*** (赤气) becomes evident, and **warm epidemic febrile diseases** (温病) are about to emerge. The people are restless and cannot sleep at night, and **yellow wind epidemic febrile diseases** (黄风化疫) arise—treatment can involve **drainage** (泄).\n\nThus, in **Mǎo-Yǒu** (卯酉) years, **Tàiyīn** (太阴) descends to Earth, obstructing **Earth’s Blue Depths** (地苍), and though subdued, it does not enter fully. After three years in Heaven, **Tàiyīn** descends into Earth in this year, becoming **Shàoyīn’s left minister** (少阴左问). It also encounters the obstruction of **Earth’s Blue Depths** (地苍窒), where **Wood** governs its suppression, preventing it from entering. Sometimes it meets **Shàoyáng** (少阳) before its retreat, meaning **Tàiyīn** has not yet been able to descend, or **Wood**’s influence arrives. In **Dīng-Yǒu** (丁酉) and **Dīng-Mǎo** (丁卯) years, **Wood**’s influence follows and suppresses it, causing it not to descend. The suppressed **stagnant *qi*** (伏) then transforms into **diseases among the people**. If it does not descend for **ten days**, it is considered prolonged.\n\nWhen **Heavenly dust** (天埃) and **yellow *qi*** (黄气) appear, and **Earth** issues **damp and steaming *qi*** (湿蒸), the people suffer from **limbs that cannot lift**, **dizziness, limb-joint pain**, and **abdominal distension** (腹满填臆). If **yellow wind** (黄风) rises three times, the people suffer from **warmth and dampness**, all experiencing **distension and fullness** (痞满)—treatment can involve **strong purgation** (大下) to heal.\n\nThus, in **Chén-Xū** (辰戌) years, **Shàoyáng** descends to Earth, obstructing **Earth’s Mysterious Depths** (地玄), and though subdued, it does not enter fully. After three years in Heaven, **Shàoyáng** descends into Earth the following year, becoming **Tàiyīn’s left minister** (太阴左问), governing **Earth’s Mysterious Depths** (地玄窒). **Water** obstructs its descent, and suppression prevents it from entering, transforming into **diseases among the people**.

The **initial qi** (初气) has not yet arrived. If **Heaven’s Official** (司天) is excessive with lingering days, it still follows the old **Heaven’s Rectification** (治天数), as the new **Heaven’s Official** (司天) has not yet **Deranged Rectification** (得迁正).

On the day of **Retreating Rectification** (退位), **Jueyin** (厥阴) may **Derange Rectification** (得治迁正). **Wind** (风) seeks to order itself, yet **cold** (寒) lingers unresolved. Warmth and **dampness** (暄) are deranged, and **Spring Rectification** (春正) loses its proper time. Though the **initial qi** (初气) may arrive, **Heaven’s Command** (天令) does not propagate, and **Wood’s qi** (木气) does not unfold. Thus, the people fall ill with **liver disorders** (病肝).\n\nWhen **Shaoyin** (少阴) fails to **Derange Rectification** (迁正), **cold qi** (冷气) does not retreat. **Spring** (春) lingers with **cold**, warmth and **dampness** (暄暖) are untimely, and the people suffer from **alternating cold and heat** (寒热), with limbs and back aching and **stiffness** (强直).\n\nWhen **Jueyin** (厥阴) governs **Heaven** (司天), its **Heaven’s Rectification** (天数) lingers. Though **Jueyin** (厥阴) may have lingering days, another **Rectification** (位) governs **Heaven** (司天), and all **Heaven’s Rectifications** (天数) must complete their full day before **Deranging Rectification** (迁正). For example, when **Shaoyin** (少阴) arrives at **Spring Equinox** (二月春分) to take its proper position, the **transformations** (造化) shift, and **Deranged Rectification** (迁正) may occur. This aligns with **Heaven’s Official** (司天).\n\nThough **Wood’s qi** (木气) may linger, its position does not exceed that of **Jinghuo** (君火). If **Wood’s qi** (木气) has lingering days beyond its due, it again governs **Heaven** (治天), and its **Heaven’s Rectification** (治数) is not yet complete. When it encounters **Jinghuo** (君火) arriving on time, **Spring Equinox** (春分) allows **Deranged Rectification** (迁正), and **Wood’s qi** (木气) has not yet retreated. Thus, it may still align with **Heaven’s Rectification** (治天). The lingering **qi** of others does not behave thus.\n\nWhen **Taiyin** (太阴) fails to **Derange Rectification** (迁正), **clouds and rain** (云雨) lose their proper ordering, and all things wither and dry.

The people suffer from **swollen limbs and joints** (手足肢节肿满), **abdominal dropsy** (大腹水肿), **distended abdomen refusing food** (填臆不食), **chronic diarrhea with flank distension** (飧泄胁满), and **limbs failing to rise** (四肢不举).\n\nWhen **Shaoyin** (少阴) governs **Heaven** (司天), its **Heaven’s Rectification** (天数) is not yet complete, hence **Taiyin** (太阴) cannot **Derange Rectification** (得迁正). When **Shaoyin** (少阴) completes its term, **Taiyin** (太阴) may **Derange Rectification** (得迁正). **Rain’s transformation** (雨化) seeks to order itself, yet **heat** (热) still governs it.

The people suffer from **nodular malaria** (瘤疟), **bone heat** (骨热), **palpitations and terror** (心悸惊骇), and in severe cases, **blood spattering** (血溢).\n\nThough it may be the **Year of the Tiger** (寅) or the **Year of the Monkey** (申), **Earth** (土) still governs.

On the day of **Retreating Rectification** (退位), **Yangming** (阳明) fails to **Derange Rectification** (迁正), hence there are many who suffer from **restlessness, thirst, and shortness of breath** (烦燥渴喘).\n\n**Heat’s transformation** (热化) spreads, yet **dryness’s transformation** (燥化) does not arrive. **Clear and forceful** (清劲) **qi** (气) has not yet acted, and **Metal’s qi** (肺金) falls ill again. Though it may be the **Year of the Rabbit** (卯) or the **Year of the Rooster** (酉), **Fire’s transformation** (火化) still governs **heat’s ordering** (热之令), hence **Metal** (肺) bears the burden of illness again.\n\nWhen **Taiyang** (太阳) fails to **Derange Rectification** (迁正), **winter cold** (冬清) reverses into **cold**, and **ease** (易令) arrives in **Spring**. **Killing frost** (杀霜) precedes, while **cold ice** (寒冰) follows. **Yang light** (阳光) again governs, with **piercing cold** (凛冽) not arising, and **dew and clouds** (露云) awaiting their proper time. The people suffer from **warm epidemic disorders** (温疠至), **closed throat with dryness** (喉闭溢乾), **restlessness and thirst** (烦燥而渴), and **shortness of breath with sound** (喘息而有音).\n\nWhen **Yangming** (阳明) governs **Heaven** (司天), its **Heaven’s Rectification** (天数) lingers.

Though it may be the **Year of the Dragon** (辰) or the **Year of the Dog** (戌), **cold’s transformation** (清化) still governs **Heaven** (治天), hence the **disorder in sequence** (失序).\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"The timing of **Deranged Rectification** (迁正) is early or late; I wish to understand its meaning.

In extreme cases, its **qi** descends again (气复下), and its calamities afflict the **spleen and lungs** (灾至脾肺藏也).\n\nYangming does not retreat from its position, causing **Spring’s clear, crisp winds** (清玲) to arise late, **grasses and trees blooming tardily**, and **alternating chills and fever** (寒热问作). The people suffer **vomiting and sudden diarrhea** (呕吐暴注), **inability to eat or drink** (食饮不下), **constipation** (大便乾燥), **limbs unable to move** (四肢不举), **blurred vision and dizziness** (目瞑掉眩).\n\nYangming’s **Heavenly Phase** (天数) is excessively dominant, extending into the next year while still governing **Heaven** (治天). Its **qi** descends again (气复降), and its calamities severely afflict the **liver** (灾至甚於肝藏也).\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"The early or late arrival of Heaven’s years—I understand this. May I inquire about Earth’s phases (地数), and may I hear them?\"*\n\nGebi replied: *\"The laws of Earth’s descent, ascent, and failure to retreat—these govern Earth’s soil transformations and the untimely changes in all things. When the proper timing for generating ten thousand things is disrupted, the sequence of phases is lost, and Heaven’s Command brings calamities to the people. This is when the upper and lower **Stems** (干) lose their proper alignment.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"I have heard that Heaven and Earth’s **Two Heavenly Stems** (二甲子) and the **Twelve Branches** (十二支) weave the upper and lower patterns of Heaven and Earth. When their phases shift and fail to hold their positions, may this be clarified?\"*\n\n*\"When the Two Heavenly Stems do not align in virtue (德), this is called **losing their guard** (失守).\"*\n\nGebi said: *\"When phases shift improperly, even if the year’s proper term is obtained, the governing phase is not secured. Then the four seasons are disordered, and great epidemics arise. When Heaven and Earth fail to align in virtue (德), this is called **Heaven and Earth losing their nodes** (失节). The upper and lower **Stems and Branches** (二管) do not harmonize in sound, and the **Great Clapper** (大不主) and **Heaven’s Master** (天主) lose their nodes. The upper and lower **Stems** are out of tune, and all things become unstable.\"*\n\nThe annotation from *The Secret Talks of the Mystic Pearl* (《玄珠密语》) states:\n*\"In a **Yang Year** (阳年), thirty years pass, excluding six years of **Heavenly Punishment** (天刑), leaving twenty-four years of excess. Excluding **Gengzi** (庚子) and **Gengwu** (庚午)—where **Metal** is punished by **Central Fire** (君火刑金运)—\n**Gengyin** (庚寅) and **Gengshen** (庚申)—where **Relative Fire** (相火) punishes **Metal** (刑金运)—\n**Wuxu** (戊戌) and **Wencheng** (戊辰)—where **Major Yang** (太阳) punishes **Fire** (刑火运).\nThese are the years when **Heaven and Earth’s qi** align with the **Central Cycle** (中运), and no excess occurs. Excluding these six years, all others function as **excessive years** (太过), contrary to their intended purpose. This is the **excess** within the **Yang Year’s Central Cycle** (阳年中运余). If there is an improper alignment of **Stems and Branches** (上下失支迭位), then it does not occur as intended. Now, when **Stems and Branches** shift improperly, they may also manifest as **deficiency** (不及).*\n\n*A **Yang Year** is a **Central Cycle of Excess** (运太过). The **Five Phases’ sounds** (五音) are all fixed, and the **Great Sound** (太音) prevails. The **Central Cycle** overcomes its own phase with excess but suffers no perverse harm, hence it is called **proper transformation and epidemic** (正化疫). When the **Stems** of **Yang** do not correspond to the **Stems** of **Yin**, the upper and lower do not harmonize, **Yin and Yang** become disordered, and **Heaven and Earth** fail to align in virtue (德). Though the **Central Cycle** is excessive in **Yang**, it still produces **excessive overcoming** (胜复乃至).*\n\n*For example, in a **Jiazi** (甲子) year, the **Central Cycle of Excess** is **Earth** (土运太窒). When **Earth** is excessive, it injures **Metal**, and **scaled insects** (鳞虫) prevail. The **kidney’s qi** is insufficient, as **Earth** overcomes **Water** (土胜於水). This is why the **Yellow Bell** (黄锺) **Stem’s sound** is high, hence it is called **excessively constricted** (太窒).*\n\n*The **Jiazi** year’s **qi** corresponds above to the **Zhen Star** (镇星), which is grand and bright. For instance, in a **Guihai** (癸亥) year with an excessive **Heavenly Phase** (天数有余), though the year transitions to **Jiazi**, **Jia** governs **Zi** but has not yet ascended to its proper position (迁正). **Jueyin** still governs **Heaven** (治天). Though **Jiazi** governs **Heaven** by term, it still transforms into **wind and crispness** (化风玲), and **Jueyin** continues to enact **Reiterated Governance** (布正於天) in **Heaven**. **Earth** has already ascended to its proper position, with **Yangming** at the **Spring** (在泉). It is also called **governing Earth** (司地), referring to the phase with high **Heavenly Phase** (数高者). The previous year was **Shaoyang**, which governed the **right question** (右问). **Guihai** governs **Earth**, and **Shaoyang** has retreated from its position, thus governing the **Earth’s right question qi** (地下之右问气). This is why **Jueyin’s Earth** and **Yangming** do not harmonize in their duties (不相和奉). Hence, it is said that the upper and lower do not harmonize (上下不相招), **Yin and Yang** become disordered (阴阳有相错), and **Gui** and **Si** oppose each other (癸与巳相对), so **Heaven and Earth** fail to align in virtue (天地不合德). This is because they do not align with **Jia** (以不合甲也). When **Gui** and **Si** converge (癸巳相会), the **Earth Central Cycle** is excessive, yet **Wood** prevails in vain, and **Metal** counterattacks. When **Metal** counterattacks, **Shaoyin** appears as if it has arrived, but **Wood** prevails like **Fire**, while **Metal**’s counterattack is weak. This is because **Shaoyin** appears while **Jueyin** has not yet retreated, and **Shaoyin** establishes itself. **Metal** seeks to counterattack, but **Fire** arrives, hence the **counterattack is slight** (复有少也). Thus, **Jia** and **Ji** lose their guard (甲己失守), and three years later, an **Earth epidemic** (土疫) manifests, reaching **Mao** (卯) late. From **Jiazi** to **Dingmao** (丁卯) spans four years. If it arrives early, it reaches **Bingyin** (丙寅) in three years. When the **Earth epidemic** arrives, it is the time of the **Four Directions** (四维). Good or bad, great or small—this is deduced from **Heaven and Earth’s** alignment, examined through **Taiyi** (太一).*\n\n*Again, take the **Jiazi** year: if **Jia** aligns with **Zi** upon exchange, it should govern **Heaven** by term (应交司而治天). **Shaoyin** governs the **Jiazi** year, ascending to its proper position in time (司天迁正应时). Below, **Ji**, **Mao**, and **Wei** have not yet ascended to their proper positions, while **Wuyin** (戊寅) **Shaoyang** has not retreated. There is also an alignment below between **Jia** and **Ji** (甲己下有合). **Jia** opposes **Wu** (甲与戊相对), and **Zi** opposes **Ding** (子与东酊个).\"",

The people suffer from **diaphragmatic heat** (膈热), **dry throat** (咽乾), **blood spattering and terror** (血溢惊骇), **red and painful urination** (小便赤涩), and **nodular rashes, eruptions, ulcers, and lingering toxins** (丹瘤疹疮疡留毒).\"",

If the overcoming is slight or does not recur, then in the following three years, the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) will manifest, called **Earth epidemic** (*tǔ lì* 土疠), whose symptoms resemble those of **Earth epidemic** (*tǔ yì* 土疫). Its origin is from **Heaven’s** (*tiān* 天) **epidemic** (*lì* 疠), descending to Earth, hence the reversal of evil transformations.\n\nThe **yin** and **yang** of Heaven and Earth differ thus, so its severity—great or small, good or evil—follows the alignment of Heaven and Earth’s **dharma** (*fǎzhǐ* 法旨).

In **Yǐchǒu** (乙丑), Earth governs, and by **Gēngchén** (庚辰), **Taiyang** (太阳) retreats its position (*tuìwèi* 退位) and acts as **right question** (*yòuwèn* 右问). Thus, Heaven is **Taiyin** (太阴) while Earth is **Jiyin** (厥阴), so Earth does not follow Heaven’s transformations (*huà* 化). The **yin** and **yang** are misaligned (*xiāngcuò* 相错), and **Bing** (辛) and **Yi** (乙) do not harmonize (*xiānghé* 相合), so their **virtues** (*dé* 德) are not joined.\n\nWhen **Yi** (乙) and **Xīn** (辛) meet, the **Water** (*shuǐ* 水) **qi** (*qì* 氣) is excessively depleted (*tàixū* 太虚), and it suffers a reversal under Earth’s victory (*shèng* 胜), hence not being excessive (*tài guò* 太过).

Though Heaven and Earth are not in their proper time (*fēishí* 非時) yet possess their **qi** (*qì* 氣), the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) will manifest as a great calamity (*dàyì* 大疫), differing from the usual **yin-yang** cycles (*fùyīng* 復應).\n\nThis occurs when **Bing** (丙) and **Xīn** (辛) fail to maintain their meeting (*shīshǒu* 失守), and in the following three years, the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) becomes **Water epidemic** (*shuǐ lì* 水疠), reaching as late as **Jǐsì** (己巳). From **Bingyin** (丙寅) to **Jǐsì** (己巳) spans four years. If it arrives early, it reaches **Wǔchén** (戊辰). From **Bingyin** (丙寅) to **Wǀchén** (戊辰) takes three years.

If gradual, it reaches **Jǐsì** (己巳), and the **Water epidemic** (*shuǐ yì* 水疫) arrives.\n\nIts severity—great or small, good or evil—is deduced from the **Heavenly Stems** (*tiānshù* 天數) of the year and **Taiyi** (太乙) **wandering through the palaces** (*yóugōng* 游宫). Again, take the **Bingyin** (丙寅) year: if **Bing** (丙) aligns with **Yin** (寅) and they meet, it should govern Heaven (*sìtiān* 司天) by exchange (*jiāo* 交) and proper ascension (*qiānzhèng* 迁正). **Shaoyang** (少阳) governs Heaven, ascending to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正) in time (*yìngshí* 应时).\n\nYet **Xīn** (辛) and **Yǐsì** (巳) have not yet ascended to their proper positions (*qiānzhèng* 迁正), and **Gēngchén** (庚辰) **Taiyang** (太阳) has not retreated its position (*tuìwèi* 退位), so **Bing** (丙) and **Xīn** (辛) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德). **Bing** (丙) opposes **Gēng** (庚), and **Chén** (辰) aligns with **Yin** (寅) in position (*wèi* 位), so the **Water** (*shuǐ* 水) **qi** (*qì* 氣) is not excessively depleted (*tài guò* 太过). If the **Water** (*shuǐ* 水) **qi** (*qì* 氣) is slightly depleted yet slightly victorious (*xiǎoshèng* 小勝), there may be a recurrence (*fù* 復). When **Bingyin** (丙寅) arrives, there is no recurrence (*wúfù* 無復). In the following three years, the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) manifests, called **Water epidemic** (*shuǐ lì* 水疠), whose symptoms resemble **Water epidemic** (*shuǐ yì* 水疫). It is also known as **Cold epidemic** (*hán lì* 寒疠). The treatment method is as before.\n\nSuppose **Gēngchén** (庚辰) is a **yang** year of excess (*tài guò* 太过), like **Jǐmào** (己卯) having surplus **Heavenly Stems** (*tiānshù* 天數). Though the exchange (*jiāo* 交) yields **Gēngchén** (庚辰) year, though **Gēng** (庚) aligns with **Chén** (辰), it has yet to ascend to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正). **Yangming** (阳明) still governs Heaven, while Earth has ascended to its proper position, with **Taiyin** (太阴) governing Earth (*sìdì* 司地). Sometimes, it governs **in the Spring** (*zàiquán* 在泉).\n\nLast year was **Bingshēn** (丙申), where **Shaoyang** (少阳) acted as **right question** (*yòuwèn* 右问).

Thus, Heaven is **Jiyin** (厥阴) while Earth is **Yangming** (阳明), so Earth does not follow Heaven’s transformations (*huà* 化). **Yangming** (阳明) should govern Heaven in conjunction with **Shaoyin** (少阴), but it does not harmonize with **Jiyin** (厥阴), so **Ding** (丁) and **Xīn** (辛) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德).\n\nWhen **Ding** (丁) and **Xīn** (辛) meet, the **Wood** (*mù* 木) **qi** (*qì* 氣) is excessively depleted (*tàixū* 太虚), and it suffers a reversal under **Metal** (*jīn* 金) victory (*shèng* 胜), hence not being excessive (*tài guò* 太过). This is the **Lúobīn** (萝宾) **pipe**, where **Tàijiǎo** (太角) does not respond, **Metal** (*jīn* 金) **qi** (*qì* 氣) prevails in dryness (*zào* 燥), and **Fire** (*huǒ* 火) **qi** (*qì* 氣) recedes into **Heat** (*rè* 熱).\n\nThis is the **Heavenly Stems** (*tiānshù* 天數) and **Earthly Branches** (*dìzhī* 地支) not in their proper time (*fēishí* 非時), and their **qi** (*qì* 氣) does not follow its usual course (*bùjié* 不節), so in three years, a great calamity (*dàyì* 大疫) will manifest across the land (*xíngtiānxìa* 行天下).

The severe cases are swift (*sù* 速), reaching as early as **Rénwǔ** (壬午). From **Gēngchén** (庚辰) to **Rénwǔ** (壬午) takes three years, which is its swift arrival (*sù zhì* 速至). The mild ones are gradual (*xú* 徐), reaching **Guǐwèi** (癸未), and the **Metal epidemic** (*jīn yì* 金疫) arrives.\n\nIts severity—great or small, good or evil—is deduced from the **Heavenly Stems** (*tiānshù* 天數) of the year and **Taiyi** (太一). The year when the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) arrives also encounters a failure to maintain the meeting (*shīshǒu* 失守), so its calamity (*zāi* 災) is great. If **Five Blessings** (*wǔfú* 五福) and **Taiyi** (太一) are not seen, then the calamity will cause more than half of the people to die (*èsǐ rén tàibàn* 惡死人太半). If they are seen yet the meeting of **virtues** (*hé dé* 合德) is restored, then the calamity is small. If **Five Blessings** (*wǔfú* 五福) and **Taiyi** (太乙) are seen, then the calamity will be small, and more than half of the people will be spared (*shànmiè qíbàn* 善滅其半).\n\nAgain, take the **Gēngchén** (庚辰) year: if **Gēng** (庚) aligns with **Chén** (辰) and they meet, it should govern Heaven (*sìtiān* 司天) by exchange (*jiāo* 交) and proper ascension (*qiānzhèng* 迁正). **Taiyang** (太阳) governs **Gēngchén** (庚辰) year, ascending to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正) and governing Heaven (*zhì tiān* 治天) in time (*yìngshí* 应时). Yet **Yǐwèi** (乙未) has not yet ascended to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正), and **Jǐwǔ** (甲午) **Shaoyin** (少阴) has not retreated its position (*tuìwèi* 退位), so **Yǐ** (乙) and **Gēng** (庚) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德). **Jia** (甲) opposes **Gēng** (庚), and **Chén** (辰) aligns with **Wǔ** (午) in position (*wèi* 位), so this order fails to maintain its meeting (*shīshǒu* 失守) and is not excessively aligned (*tài guò* 太过).\n\nIf **Yǐwèi** (乙未) **dryness** (*gān* 干) lacks **rigidity** (*gāng* 剛), it is also a slight depletion of **Metal** (*jīn* 金) **qi** (*qì* 氣), with a slight victory or no recurrence (*yǒuxiǎoshèng huòwúfù* 有小勝或無復). **Taiyin** (太阴) ascends to **Wèi** (未), so there is no recurrence (*wúfù* 無復). In the following three years, the **epidemic** (*lì* 疠) manifests, called **Metal epidemic** (*jīn lì* 金疠), whose symptoms resemble **Metal epidemic** (*jīn yì* 金疫). **Metal epidemic** (*jīn yì* 金疫) is also called **Killing epidemic** (*shā lì* 杀疠), and **Metal epidemic** (*jīn lì* 金疠) is also called **Killing epidemic** (*shā lì* 杀疠). The treatment method is as before.\n\nSuppose **Rénwǔ** (壬午) is a **yang** year of excess (*tài guò* 太过), like **Xīnjǐ** (辛巳) having surplus **Heavenly Stems** (*tiānshù* 天數). Though the exchange (*jiāo* 交) yields **Rénwǔ** (壬午) year, though **Rén** (壬) aligns with **Wǔ** (午), it has yet to ascend to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正). **Jiyin** (厥阴) still governs Heaven, while Earth has ascended to its proper position, with **Yangming** (阳明) governing **in the Spring** (*zàiquán* 在泉). **Dingyǒu** (丁酉) governs (*zhì* 治). Last year was **Bingshēn** (丙申), where **Shaoyang** (少阳) acted as **right question** (*yòuwèn* 右问). In **Rénwǔ** (壬午), **Dingyǒu** (丁酉) ascends to its proper position (*qiānzhèng* 迁正), and in **Xīnjǐ** (辛巳), **Bingshēn** (丙申) retreats its position (*tuìwèi* 退位).\n\nThus, Heaven is **Jiyin** (厥阴) while Earth is **Yangming** (阳明), so Earth does not follow Heaven’s transformations (*huà* 化). **Yangming** (阳明) should govern Heaven in conjunction with **Shaoyin** (少阴), but it does not harmonize with **Jiyin** (厥阴), so **Ding** (丁) and **Xīn** (辛) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德). When **Ding** (丁) and **Xīn** (辛) meet, the **Wood** (*mù* 木) **qi** (*qì* 氣) is excessively depleted (*tàixū* 太虚), and it suffers a reversal under **Metal** (*jīn* 金) victory (*shèng* 胜), hence not being excessive (*tài guò* 太过).\n\nThis is the **Lúobīn** (萝宾) **pipe**,",
      "overlap_context": " (太一).*\n\n*Again, take the **Jiazi** year: if **Jia** aligns with **Zi** upon exchange, it should govern **Heaven** by term (应交司而治天). **Shaoyin** governs the **Jiazi** year, ascending to its proper position in time (司天迁正应时). Below, **Ji**, **Mao**, and **Wei** have not yet ascended to their proper positions, while **Wuyin** (戊寅) **Shaoyang** has not retreated.

Thus, Heaven was **Dingwèi** (丁未), Earth **Guǐhài** (癸亥), so Earth did not follow Heaven’s transformations (*huà* 化). **Jiyin** (厥阴) should govern above in conjunction with **Shaoyang** (少阳), yet it does not harmonize with **Taiyin** (太阴), so **Ding** (丁) and **Guǐ** (癸) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德).

This is the **Yízhé** (夷则) **pipe**, where the **upper Great Zheng** (*shàng tài zhēng* 上太征) does not respond. Since **Wù** (戊) and **Guǐ** (癸) do not harmonize, the **Fire** **qi** (*qì* 氣) does not respond, and the **Yízhé** **pipe** does not answer its **Zheng** (*zhēng* 征). Below, the **Guǐhài** (癸亥) **pipe** responds to the **minor Zheng** (*xiǎo zhēng* 少征), for **Guǐhài** (癸亥) governs Earth. Thus, the **same-sounding** (*tóngshēng* 同声) does not respond, and Heaven and Earth above and below do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德), hence no response.\n\nThis is **Wù** (戊) and **Guǐ** (癸) failing to govern their meeting, and in three years, **plague** (*yì* 疫) arises, arriving swiftly by **Gēngxū** (庚戌)—three years in total. Its severity—great or small, benevolent or malevolent—is determined by the **Heavenly Stem** (*tiānshù* 天数) of the plague’s arrival and the **Taiyi** (太一). Again, as with **Wùshēn** (戊申), when **Wù** (戊) arrives at **Shēn** (申), it should govern Heaven in season, ascending to its proper position.\n\nBelow, **Guǐhài** (癸亥) has not ascended, and **Rénxū** (壬戌), **Taiyang** (太阳), has not retreated its position. Thus, **Wù** (戊) and **Guǐ** (癸) do not harmonize their **virtues** (*dé* 德). **Rén** (壬) and **Wù** (戊) oppose each other, while **Shēn** (申) and **Xū** (戌) align—this is a failure of governance, not harmonization, nor excess. Below, **Guǐ** (癸), soft and yielding, lacks firmness, so the **Fire** **qi** (*qì* 氣) is slightly depleted (*xiǎo xū* 小虚), with minor victory and possibly no reversal. When **Jiyin** (厥阴) arrives, there is no reversal.\n\nIn the following three years, **cātè** (疠) arises—named **Fire cātè** (*huǒ cātè* 火疠). Treatment follows prior methods: **cooling** (*lǎn* 寒) and **draining** (*xiè* 泄).\n\nThe above five failures of governance bring five plagues; the below five failures bring five **cātè** (疠). When both **Yang** (*gāng* 刚) and **Yin** (*róu* 柔) **Stems** jointly govern the **qi** (*qì* 氣) cycle, yet a **Branch** (*zhī* 支) fails to hold its position, these five methods apply—all in **Yang** years.\n\n**Huángdì** (黄帝) asked: *\"When human **qi** (*qì* 氣) is insufficient, Heaven’s **qi** is like a void, and human **spirit** (*shén* 神) loses governance, the **spirit-light** (*shēnguāng* 神光) does not gather—evil spirits assail the person, leading to untimely death.

If this occurs while **Shaoyin** (少阴) governs Heaven and Heaven’s **Stem** (*shù* 数) is insufficient, and **Taiyin** (太阴) arrives as **right question** (*yòuwèn* 右问), this is called **Heaven’s void** (*tiān xū* 天虚)—thus, human **qi** and Heaven’s **qi** are both void.*\n\n*Again, if startled and **jing** (*jīng* 精) is depleted, sweat emerges from the **Heart**. Great startlement causes sweat from the **Heart**, depleting the **Heart’s** **vessel-pulse** (*mài* 脉), so the **spirit** (*shén* 神) loses governance of the **Heart**. Thus, the three voids—**Heart**, **spirit**, and **light**—cause the **spirit** (*shén* 神) to lose governance.*\n\n*First, there is a disease of **spirit-labor** (*láoshén* 劳神), and then encountering **Shaoyin** (少阴) with insufficient Heavenly **Stem** (*shù* 数), further startled and **jing** (*jīng* 精) depleted—these three convergences cause the **spirit** (*shén* 神) to lose governance.*\n\n*The **Heart** is the sovereign’s **viscus**, from which **spirit** (*shén* 神) and **clarity** (*míng* 明) emerge. If the **Heart** first has disease, and then encounters Heaven’s void, it is further burdened by Heaven’s excess void. The **Heart**, entrusted to govern all things, is thus the sovereign’s **viscus**. In **clarity** and **stillness**, it holds **spirit** (*shén* 神), hence it is said that **spirit** (*shén* 神) and **clarity** (*míng* 明) emerge from it.*\n\n*When the **spirit** (*shén* 神) loses governance, it wanders to the **upper elixir field** (*dāntián* 丹田), beneath **Taiyi** (太一) **Emperor** (*Dìjūn* 帝君) and **Níwán** (泥丸) **Lord** (*Jūn* 君). The **Taiyi** (太一) **Emperor** (*Dìjūn* 帝君), in the head, is the **Níjiǔ** (泥九) **Lord**, commanding all **spirits** (*shén* 神).

The **spirit-light** is the **flying round light** (*fēiyuán guāng* 飞圆光). If the round light is impure, it becomes deficient, and **evil spirits**, **Yin corpses** (*yīn shī* 阴尸), and **ghosts** (*guǐ* 鬼) assail the person.

Again, if one encounters a year when **Taiyin** (太阴) governs Heaven insufficiently, the **Shaoyang** (少阳) **qi** rises to compensate, which is called **emptiness** (*xū* 虚). When a person’s **qi** and Heaven’s **qi** are both insufficient, they are struck by the **emptiness** of Heaven and man, and by **double emptiness**.\n\nThis is when a person’s **qi** is empty and Heaven’s **qi** is empty, and if they further overindulge in food and drink, sweat emerges from the **Stomach** (*wèi* 胃). If they are drunk and gluttonous and engage in sexual activity, sweat emerges from the **Spleen**. When the **Spleen** and **Stomach** sweat, **essence** and **blood** are depleted, and they are struck by Heaven’s **emptiness**, forming **triple emptiness** (*sān xū* 三虚). The **Spleen’s spirit** (*shén* 神) loses its post.\n\nThus, **triple emptiness** arises, and the **Spleen’s spirit** loses its post. First, there is illness in the **Spleen**; then, encountering Heaven’s **emptiness**, the **Spleen** is struck by **double emptiness**. If sweat emerges and depletes **essence** and **blood**, this is called **triple emptiness**. The **Spleen** is the **Censor-in-Chief** (*jiànyì zhī guān* 谏议之官), from which wisdom emanates. The **Spleen** is the **Heart’s** (*xīn* 心) child; when the **Heart** remembers, it is called **intent** (*yì* 意). What emerges from intent is called **wisdom** (*zhì* 智). When wisdom encompasses all things, it is called **spirit** (*shén* 神). Thus, the **Spleen’s** spirit, intent, and wisdom lose their post.\n\nWhen the spirit loses its post, the **spiritual radiance** (*shén guāng* 神光) shifts and does not gather.

If one sits long in damp places or forcibly enters water, the **Kidneys** (*shèn* 肾) are injured.

When **essence** is lost, the **Heart’s spirit** loses its post.\n\nThe **Kidneys** are the **Minister of Strength** (*zuòqiáng zhī guān* 作强之官), from which ingenuity emanates. Thus, **triple emptiness** arises, and the **Kidney’s spirit** loses its post, with **spirit** and **will** (*shí* 志) shifting. The **spirit**, **essence**, and **will**—the three **spirits**—become empty and shift, wandering beneath the **Yellow Court** (*Huángtíng* 黄庭) where the **Lord of Destiny** (*Sìmìng Jūn* 司命君) presides. Thus, the **circular radiance** (*yuán guāng* 圆光) becomes deficient.

If **triple emptiness** persists and **Water** is insufficient, **yellow corpse ghosts** assail them, with cow-like heads and yellow bodies. Seeing them drains one’s **spirit** and **soul**, causing sudden death.\n\nIf one suffers from **anger** rising and not descending, the **Liver** (*gān* 肝) is injured. If this occurs while **Juéyin** (厥阴) governs Heaven insufficiently, **Shaoyin** (少阴) **qi** rises to compensate, which is called **Heaven’s emptiness**. The **Liver** first falls ill, then is struck by **double emptiness** from Heaven. This is called **Heaven’s emptiness** and **man’s emptiness**. If they further engage in hasty movement or fear, sweat emerges from the **Liver**. The **Liver** is the **General** (*jiāngjūn zhī guān* 将军之官), from which planning and deliberation emanate. The **spirit’s** post is lost, and the **spiritual radiance** does not gather. When the **spiritual radiance** does not gather, the **circular radiance** becomes deficient and incomplete, and **corpse ghosts** assail them. If this occurs in a year when **Wood** is insufficient—whether in **Dīng** (丁) years lacking correspondence, **Rén** (壬) years, or when **Juéyin** governs Heaven insufficiently—**white corpse ghosts** (*bái shī guǐ* 白尸鬼) appear, causing sudden death.\n\nFor those with **triple emptiness**, the **spirit** wanders and loses its post. **White corpse ghosts** assail them, with hawk-like heads and white bodies, white hair. Seeing them drains one’s **spirit** and **soul**, causing sudden death.\n\nThe above five cases of losing one’s post are when **Heaven’s emptiness** and **man’s emptiness** coincide, with the **spirit** wandering and losing its post, and the five **corpse ghosts** assailing them, causing sudden death—this is called **corpse syncope** (*shī jué* 尸厥). If one suddenly dies without drooling, with a retracted tongue like a coiled egg, or if **corpse syncope** occurs with drooling and a retracted tongue, this is **severe syncope**.\n\nIf one violates the **Five Spirits’** (*wǔ shén* 五神) proper positions, the **spiritual radiance** becomes incomplete. It is not only **corpse ghosts**—all manner of **evil spirits** assail them because the **spirit** has lost its post. When the **spirit** loses its post, even within the body, the **Two Qi** (*èr qì* 二气) lose their positions, and the **spiritual radiance** does not gather, allowing **evil spirits** to assail them. If **demons** and **spirits** communicate and pass through, it is because the **Five Spirits** have lost their posts, and **evil** has arrived.\n\nThis is why those who **guard** (*shǒu* 守) live, and those who lose their post die. Those who **guard** maintain their original positions, with the **Five Spirits** each occupying their proper abode. Thus, the **spiritual radiance** becomes bright and gathers, and all **evil spirits** do not assail them—they live. Those who **obtain the spirit** prosper; those who lose the **spirit** perish.\n\nAs **Laozi** says: *\"When **qi** enters the body, it is called life; when the **spirit** departs the body, it is called death.\"* Thus, life arises from the **spirit**; when the **spirit** is present, life is sustained. When the **spirit** departs, life is cut short. What is called the **spirit** wandering and losing its post does not immediately mean death, for its overseer resides in the head—the **Three Sovereigns** (*sān zūn* 三尊) of high position and **Spiritual Lords** (*líng zhǔ* 灵主) speak of it. The **Supreme One Emperor** (*Tài Yī Dìjūn* 太一帝君) is in the head, at the **Néihuán** (*泥丸*), governing the **spirit**. The **Lord Without Rival** (*Wúyīng Jūn* 无英君) on the left restrains the **Three Souls** (*sān hún* 三魂), and the **White Primordial Lord** (*Bái Yuán Jūn* 白元君) on the right confines the **Seven Spirits** (*qī pò* 七魄). The **Souls** are the **Yang Spirit** (*yáng shén* 阳神), and the **Spirits** are **Yin Ghosts** (*yīn guǐ* 阴鬼). If the **Three Sovereigns** above do not oversee them, the **spirit** departing its post leads to death.\n\nNow, when the **Five Spirits** lose their posts, they also have their overseers. When the **spiritual radiance** does not gather and the **circular radiance** becomes deficient, **evil spirits** assail them. If the **spirit** loses its post, one knows whether a person’s **spirit** prospers or perishes.",
