  "full_translation": "**The Gushen Chapter**\n\n**Title:** *The Gushen Chapter*. Two fascicles. Originally attributed to Lin Yuan Shenfeng Mi of the Five Fortunes Mystic Nest, dating to the Yuan dynasty. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, Methods category.\n\n**Preface to the Gushen Chapter**\n\nThe ancient sage-kings who governed the world as public office first transmitted the Dao of immortals in silent succession. Those who governed the world as private inheritance did not pass on this Way. Thus, it ended with Yu, and afterward dispersed among recluses beyond the world, all transmitting it orally, without establishing written texts. By the Zhou dynasty, the Old Master set forth five thousand words—his language profoundly ancient, his meaning profoundly subtle. Who but a spirit or sage could fathom it? Liezi and Zhuang Zhou regarded it as emptiness and nothingness; Gai Gong and Cao Can saw it as purity and stillness. Though not the orthodox interpretation, they did not stray far from the Dao.\n\nYet among its misfortunes, there were three: First, the followers of Shen Buhai and Han Fei twisted it into cruelty and mercilessness, distorting it with the fallacies of penal laws. Second, Kou Qianzhi of the Northern Wei, having compiled Daoist scriptures, found them insufficient in number and thus merged them with techniques of prescriptions, talismanic water, alchemical elixirs, divination, and apocryphal texts, confounding them into one. Third, before the coming of the Buddhist Dharma, the teachings beyond the world were of two kinds: one called immortality, the other called the Daoist school. Immortality pertains to life, the yang; the Dao pertains to nature, the yin. Though the division of these two schools in the bibliographic treatises of various histories may not be entirely precise, their distinction is nonetheless clear.\n\nYet those of limited insight, constrained by their teachings, could not discern the difference. Foolishly taking the solitary yin within the body, they pointed to the heart and kidneys as Kan and Li, lead and mercury, engaging in the intercourse of the golden elixir. They deceived the foolish with their clamor, the blind leading the blind.\n\nAlas, how can one not sigh in lament! For over twenty years, I have harbored this indignation, yet found no one with whom to speak.\n\nOf late, I have encountered Master Lin of Xuáncháo, a hermit of the Three Mountains, and at a single word, our minds met as if needle to magnet—a once-in-a-millennium fortune for which I cannot but rejoice. The Master then presented me with his *Three Mysteries Treatise*. Reverently taking it in hand, I read with awe, my heart astounded and my eyes turned anew. I long to carve and disseminate it, that it may broadly benefit scholars, yet my coffers are ever empty, and the means to do so elusive. Thus, I earnestly beseech the renowned and the well-disposed to join in this noble endeavor, that its radiance may illuminate posterity—not without purpose.\n\nOf old, the Perfected Lord of Jǐngyáng foretold in his *Mysterious Record* that a thousand years hence, in the region of the Five Mounds, eight hundred earthbound immortals would emerge. Now, the time is nigh! This book shall awaken faith and insight in all who encounter it, awaiting the true transmission. Those who attain the Great Elixir of Dragon and Tiger shall ascend directly to the ranks of immortals, fulfilling the prophecy, and enter the gate of longevity and enduring vision—how could this not be the path of the great man?\n\nLet none among us abandon themselves. Written in the sixth month of summer, in the yǐ-mǎo year of the Yányán reign, by Zhào Sīxuán Cóngshàn of Zhàozhōu, at the Háo River in Línchuān.\n\nI have heard that through cultivating the Dao one attains immortality, through practicing Chan one becomes a Buddha, and through Confucian study one advances in office. These three pursuits are the great endeavors of extraordinary men, yet few achieve them. The Dao operates by principle, medicine by principle, and governance by principle. Without the character *lǐ* (principle), to what could the Dao cling to justify its name?\n\nMankind is born into this life, yet none can escape old age and death. Those who speak of cultivating the Dao speak of cultivating the body; those who speak of refining the elixir speak of refining the form. The wise may seek benefit thereby, while the foolish only invite harm. Why is this so?\n\nMan’s body is received from his parents, a single spark of primordial yang coalescing into the physical frame, growing into a six-foot form. The origin of this body is not a fabrication of willful imagination or something conjured from nothing. At the age of fifteen, one’s years resemble the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, the great abundance of lead and mercury complete within the crucible and cauldron. Beyond this point, gradual decline sets in. Moreover, with the tumult of emotions and desires, essence and qi inevitably wane and dissipate. Before middle age, many already show weariness in their faces and loss upon their heads—a lamentable sight indeed!\n\nThus, the immortals of antiquity clearly pointed to the two qi of life and body as the root of the medicine. The teaching urges one to infer and augment, to compare qi with lead to prolong life. There is no other meaning here—this is the principle of sealing the furnace and mending the altar. Such is the Way of loss and gain.\n\nYet there are foolish men, shallow in fortune, who know not the preciousness of their bodies or the value of their lives. They fail to preserve the original destiny of their innate celestial alignment, instead praying for longevity before wooden idols and clay effigies—thus do they remain ignorant of the Dao. In vain do they exert effort in anger, donning coarse garments and eating bark, enduring hunger and cold. Seeking the formless Dao, they exhaust their bodies in rigid sitting, clenching their fists to cultivate qi—yet gain nothing.\n\nMoreover, some engage in debating empty doctrines, vying in verbal sparring, composing literary responses, and deeming such pursuits their life’s work. They merely strive to outwit others in conversation, yet even in old age remain utterly lost—all for lack of seeking true awakening. Worse still, they mutilate their forms and extinguish their natures, growing ever more deluded. They sit idly as the world’s clamor swirls around them, yet none can escape the consequences of their folly.\n\nSome arbitrarily fabricate perverse theories, claiming that since man possesses a body, all sensory dusts defile it, and thus all existence is illusory. Others spin endless discourses on life and death, asserting that since birth must end in extinction, seeking life is mere survival, and true bliss lies only in quiescent annihilation. They say that in death, the yin soul reveals one’s original face—neither born nor destroyed, neither increasing nor diminishing. Or they claim that the luminous spirit abides eternally in the void, yet where does it suddenly depart? Those who stitch together such hollow arguments later regret that the body is the root of suffering, yet cannot abandon it. Some burn their crowns, sever their arms, or mutilate their limbs; others cast themselves into water or fire, deluded into believing such acts are mere illusion.\n\nThere are those who sit passively awaiting old age to exhaust their allotted years, only to be mocked for their senility. How can they know that in death, the hun and po wander the gloomy paths, buffeted by wind and rain, suffering according to their karma? Have they not heard of those who perish in war? Though their forms are gone, their spirits still crave blood offerings to soothe their souls. Those who die of starvation, though their mouths are no more, still yearn for grains and cakes to ease their hunger. Those who perish naked, though their bodies are no more, still seek silks and coins to cover their shame. Those who drown, though their blessings are no more, still long for glutinous rice dumplings to honor their memory. Those who succumb to ulcers, though their backs are no more, still require straw effigies to bind their pain. Those who die in childbirth, though their blood is no more, still demand orchid basins to cleanse their filth. And what of those who hang themselves, drown unjustly, perish in prison, or die on the road? Their souls are seized and replaced, yet they cannot escape the bitter realms. Let the wise ponder this: where is the bliss in quiescent annihilation?\n\nMan possesses a body—while alive for a single day, he gains a day’s joy; delaying death by a year, he adds a year’s wisdom. With deep wisdom and far-reaching insight, he may commune with the divine. Thus the common saying goes: foxes that live long learn human speech; pythons that endure the ages summon wind and rain; sandalwood and cypress, with time, develop fragrance; clams and oysters, sealing their essence, nurture pearls. How much more, then, should man—the most numinous of beings—pursue the Dao to seek life? With the body as the pivot of the numinous, should he not refine his form to attain immortality?\n\nThe Dao is no esoteric mystery—it is found in daily speech and mundane affairs. Its principles are exquisitely subtle, its mechanisms attuned to movement and stillness. Yet it is often illustrated through familiar analogies, and without a sincere and earnest approach to learning, few can truly grasp it. Is this Dao something my noble peers may hear—or not? As the *Immortals’ Classic* states: \"The Way of fleeting laughter is not worth discussing with lesser minds. Only those of superior wisdom and strength can uphold it.\"\n\nI am a man of the Lin clan from Min’s homeland. In my youth, I suffered through warfare, family strife, and mutual betrayal, scattering my kin. I wished to pursue the scholarly path, but circumstances prevented it; I considered taking refuge in the Buddha’s gate, but feared leaving no legacy. Adrift like tumbleweed, I endured countless trials, knowing hardship and poverty, mastering humble tasks. Upon reading the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon*, I felt as though I had long understood its truths. Thus, I devoted my heart to the Dao, exhausting my body and squandering my years, wandering lakes and seas, enduring hunger, cold, and toil, accepting all things as they came.\n\nFortunately, I met a perfected one who took pity on me and instructed me in the essentials of cultivating truth—for preserving the body is the foremost art. I then pored over countless scriptures, consulted diverse teachings, and realized: to seek long life, one must return to one’s origin; to see the Tathāgata, one must investigate the fundamental. That origin is the primordial qi; the fundamental is essence and blood. Knowing the root, one’s efforts are not wasted—like the starving finding food, the sick receiving medicine. Awakening to the true and constant, one solidifies the path to the Dao.\n\nYet some cling to empty words and perverse views, claiming to accumulate karmic causes for future lives or cultivate blessings for the next, while treating their present body and mind as useless vessels. Without cultivation, there is no attainment—ultimately, all is emptiness. Examining the alchemical classics and texts on the Elixir, I see that the most crucial method lies in the divine water of the Flower Pool, the foundation of all elixirs and the ancestor of the Great Dao. Preserved, it is called the Precious Pearl; conjoined, it is called the Golden Elixir. Though a thousand schools share this principle, their verses and songs each express their intent. Through diligent practice, my words flow smoothly, and my speech resonates with the divine—though I am ashamed of my inadequacy.\n\nAs for the fire phases and the weights of the ingredients, these have already been expounded by past sages; I dare not add superfluous details. Reflecting on my shallow grasp of the supreme Dao, I hesitate to speak further. Yet fearing the waste of years, I plan to retreat to a secluded island, dwelling in mountain caves to make my final rest. Often I think of old friends scattered like stars across the Wu and Chu regions, at the ends of the earth—unable to bid them all farewell, I have no choice but to gather these crude words, like curdled milk, and send them to like-minded souls as a parting message.\n\nThus I compose this work, titling it *Valley Spirit*, for it concerns nothing more than nurturing the primordial qi. Though its language is coarse and its words unrefined, it preserves the workings of creation. If any discerning gentlemen chance upon it, may they read with understanding, silently resonating with its truths and subtly aligning with the Dao’s mysteries. Should they find passages awkward or poorly crafted, I would be grateful for their corrections.\n\nI received this transmission from a teacher, tracing back through the lineage of Han Xiaoyao, and am a disciple in the line of Master Lu’an Yu.\n\nAs for his person—ordinary and sage blended as one, hidden and manifest beyond measure. Moreover, I, in my lowly station, have long studied despite chronic illness, ever fearful that my meager blessings and shallow destiny may yet bind me to worldly dust, leaving me unworthy of self or teacher. Thus I dare not inscribe his name. This is meant only for those who would emulate the learned.\n\nComposed on the day of *yiyang laifu* in the *jiachen* year of the eighth *Dade* reign, by Lin Yuan Shenfeng of the Five Blessings Mystic

ill, still sought physicians.\nPity us fools who probe the wordless,\nHow many heroes are led astray by ghosts!\n\nHearing the Dao, without a teacher doubts remain,\nHard to seek the divine water to enter the Flower Pool.\nUnversed in the Moon Grotto’s capture of lead and mercury,\nDo not speak of *kan* and *li* before others.\nFireflies arise from rotting grass—easy to perish,\nWaiting by the tree for hares—slow to awaken.\nBefore the returning cinnabar is refined, the head turns white,\nHands idle, hearts grieving, awaiting death’s hour.\n\nHarmonize lead and mercury to lay the elixir’s foundation,\nEncompass the armillary sphere, bind it to the west.\nGrasp the interval between wood and metal,\nSeek the parity of *geng* and *jia*.\nThe Metal Lord marries as the Azure Dragon’s son-in-law,\nThe Crone’s daughter weds as the White Tiger’s wife.\nFollowing the Yellow Matron’s matchmaking,\nIn the depths of mystery, the *daogui* is born.\n\nHaving found the true path to the Mysterious Pass,\nI teach you to easily refine the returning cinnabar.\nSplit open chaos to divide pure and turbid,\nWash away the dust’s clamor to reveal saint and mortal.\nNurtured naturally, the golden liquid warms,\nRefined swiftly, mercury dries.\nClearly, a single vibration of the Western advent,\nDragon and tiger are but two names for the same.\n\nReceiving the immortal elder’s wish-fulfilling gourd,\nDiligently draw water to cultivate the spirit-sprout.\nWarm springs bathe the evening cave of shrimps,\nThe bright moon ever fills the Magpie Bridge.\nThe Wood Maiden hides

the two poles, birth the child,\nMercury and lead, the two *qi*, merge into returning cinnabar.\nI urge you to earnestly seek the Mysterious Female,\nSeeking outside the body is all heterodoxy.\n\nFather’s essence, mother’s blood—roots of mercury and lead,\nIn substance, the Mysterious contains the Primordial Honored One.\nDistinguish the wondrous medicine to know returning cinnabar,\nDiscern the great Dao from its byways.\nMilk is the blood’s dwelling—drink it when fitting,\n*Qi* is the essence’s temple—swallow it swiftly.\nEmbrace the One, further cultivate the Dharma of Peace,\nWhat worry then for life’s impermanence?\n\nStealing the workings of transformation, plant and eat the peach of immortality,\nYour rosy complexion ever like spring’s intoxication.\nUnfurl the Ghost Valley’s soul-ensnaring net,\nEnter the Tushita’s Palace of Ultimate Bliss.\nDeeply fear the axe’s theft—guard in secret,\nIn old age, pluck the fruit, hoping for boundlessness.\nFlowers bloom and fall—do not grasp,\nGaze afar as they scatter in riotous red.\n\nThe initial aim of cultivation was to prolong life,\nBut lacking transmission, one drifts into Chan.\nMistaking the eye’s light for constant vigilance,\nOne scorns the body’s sack as frail.\nDissolving the soul into *po* makes one a ghost,\nRefining *po* to return to *hun* makes one an immortal.\nThrough the ages, masters share one principle:\nTeach people to seek lead in the water’s realm.\n\nWealth and poverty in cultivation depend on past causes,\nThe poor cultivate *qi*, the rich cultivate the body.\n*Qi* departing the body becomes a yin ghost,\nThe body firmly preserved is called the Valley Spirit.\nWithout lead, life’s completion cannot sustain wealth,\nMeeting immortals and knowing the medicine turns sorrow to poverty.\nCultivation has its categories—seek the proper match,\nCultivating *qi* without residue is vainly proclaimed.\n\nLearning immortality, one shuns death,\nSetting up the cauldron and furnace is the great plan.\nFirmly grasp the alms bowl to subdue the Water Mother,\nNo need for lamps or urns to continue the barren mounds.\nNine years embracing the Dao, three thousand days,\nTwelve autumns refining the elixir.\nVying with skeletons for the breath of hunger,\nDefiantly refusing to eat earthen steamed buns.\n\nDry Chan, bound by precepts—matters obscure,\nWithout *li* and *kan*, no inversion is possible.\nTo preserve life, seek mercury within cinnabar,\nTo refine form, rely on lead in water.\nGuarding the elixir, the *qi*’s signs are ever like drunkenness,\nThe work of firing delights most in sleep.\nIf you cling to sitting in stillness to complete the Dao,\nYou’ll emerge from the prison of death as an immortal.\n\nMount Sumeru rolls

Great Unity enfolds the numinous, transmuting into jade perfection,\nThe dancing robe remains unstained by worldly dust.\nThe lead-flower immortal maidens trail their radiance,\nThe Golden Grain Tathāgata reveals his wondrous form.\n\nBenefiting beings with merit is called supreme goodness,\nRefining form to merge with the Dao slays the life-spirit.\nWhy blame bamboo and silk for their dim

souls.\nBalanced reversal and restraint serve the elixir’s work,\nOnce attained, fullness sustains life’s length.\n\nSipping from Rāhu’s throat, swallowing jade instructions,\nTending the Moon’s

withdrawal and addition fills the jade flask.\n\nThe Great Elixir is unknown to the world,\nPerusing divine formulas exhausts secret injunctions.\nSearching the Flowery Pond for the Red Child,\nEmbracing him to present to the Primordial Lord.\n\nThe belly first receives qi, guard against dietary leakage,\nThe brain gradually congeals spirit, beware of sneezes dividing it.\nAll endless mysteries are revealed,\nExhorting people to cultivate the Dao through diligence alone.\n\nHow many refine the true yet fail to preserve it?\nThose with intention but no resolve are fools.\nKnowing well that a foot of jade is not one’s treasure,\nRefining yellow gold may yet ruin the self.\n\nBribes to seek marriage, filling the ranks of nieces and sisters,\nCarved saddles and prancing steeds outshine qilin.\nEasily courting death through arrogance and ease,\nTo learn the Dao, one must be utterly impoverished to the bone.\n\nDaoist and Buddhist scriptures are weighed scruple by scruple,\nThe wish-fulfilling mani pearl, the jade-black jewel.\nXiao Liang’s resentment and blockage yield no gain,\nHan Wu’s extravagance cannot be pursued.\n\nMaitreya’s staff-head

granaries,\nMorning requires golden liquor, evening jade nectar.\nWashing and clarifying the numinous essence like autumn waters,\nCongealing the primordial spirit surpasses dawn frost.\n\nGhost-fire burns open the flying rat’s cave,\nBarbarian thunder splits the sleeping dragon’s ridge.\nEver since the Great Treasury’s Yellow Court path,\nOne often rides the goat-cart into the emerald chamber.\n\nIn old age retreating to the mountains to learn immortality,\nRefining elixirs and burning medicines to preserve one’s remaining years.\nThe two bows of Gen and Dui wrestle lead and mercury,\nThe six unions of Qian and Kun bear the mysterious feminine.\n\nThe earth ghost subdues the female to form the poisonous egg,\nThe metal lord conceals the worm, nurturing frog’s saliva.\nA hundred mornings of bathing, busy moving the tripod,\nFrom white to yellow, ten months complete.\n\nCinnabar and jade slips pair harmoniously,\nDry mercury embraces wet mercury.\nWatering golden flowers to grow the treasure tree,\nBoiling jade liquor to cast the jasper tower.\n\nThe great thousand transformations abound in numinous sages,\nAttaining the One makes all things complete.\nIf the mind for profit and fame is not yet sated,\nOne returns again to seek within the red.\n\nYin at its extreme, yang arises, the six pulses fill,\nEarth thunder shakes the floating elixir pearl palace.\nWhen the first line moves, all lines move,\nOne method mastered, all methods are mastered.\n\nThe golden tripod bathes lead in weak waters,\nThe jade furnace advances fire, shunning the black wind.\nDifferent names emerge from the same source, none recognize it,\nAll lies within the mysterious pass’s sacred key.\n\nWithout encountering true explanation, why rush?\nFirst ensure sweet and savory nourish the skin-sack.\nMorning combing, night pillowing, follow heaven’s principle,\nSummer linen, winter furs, observe the world’s ways.\n\nMeat nourishes spirit, aiding healing,\nThe human body’s illusory form is precious to preserve.\nBlood, essence, tears, and saliva—though yin substances,\nWith the right instructions and cultivation, they too prolong life.\n\nSeeking arts at the world’s edge, planting peaches of immortality,\nPassing through Yunmeng and Yangping several times.\nPlucking thunder to take home and plant,\nAgain wrapping stars to sift them out.\n\nTemporarily employing the method of *na jia* to nourish dry bones,\nLoathing the *gou geng* method that speaks of thatched huts.\nIf the Yellow Way is not cultivated but the Black Way is,\nThe vast heavenly net may be hard to escape.\n\nTo seek the Dao, first seek the formless,\nDo not confuse dragon and tiger with careless explanations.\nThe killing mechanism reverses in bedroom arts,\nDesire’s sinking delusion is well-bottom Chan.\n\nThe birth cave welcomes the red snake entwined in blood,\nThe tongue’s tip sends forth the white wild fox’s saliva.\nPrecious gold and silk transmit deviant ways,\nWaiting for how many mutton coins?\n\nThe Three Clarities’ examinations select great scholars,\nFrauds fill the ranks, the Dao is not upheld.\nThe heavenly eye’s perfect benevolence discerns good and evil,\nWorldly affairs shift wisdom to touch both worthy and foolish.\n\nThe old immortal’s raw material for immortality,\nTransmitted to men of great resolve.\nA fine steed needs no fine whip’s shadow,\nThe mysterious pass swiftly entered—does it come or not?\n\nImmortals are humans refined—who cannot do this?\nLater, following advice is like wood following the plumb line.\nThe mother labors across the sea to search for divine medicines,\nEasily, facing the wind, mending the life-lamp.\n\nSeeking the Dao in the southwest, the transmission is wondrous,\nLosing friends in the northeast—what was truly gained?\nHeavenly truth, pure and mixed, is finely pared,\nA cup of dark wine, bending the arm to rest.\n\n*Principle of the One Truth*\nThe Dao’s namelessness is established through the One;\nThe formless of things arises through the One.\nThe Dao divides the source of inherent nature,\nThe One binds the stem of life’s tether.\n\nDelighting in the Dao yet forgetting the One obtains its common name;\nGuarding the One while practicing the Dao embraces its fine essence.\nThus the One is the beginning of all numbers,\nThe One is the omen of all things,\nThe One is the mother of all characters.\nTherefore, the Dao and One together bear the load,\nSubstance and function both illuminated—\nThe One as substance, the Dao as function,\nNature is unborn, yet life is born.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Qian is Heaven! Kun is Earth! Valleys are marshes! Things take form!\" Yet the *Daoist Classic* counters: \"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; valleys attain the One and become full; the myriad things attain the One and come to life.\" Man, too, is a thing—attaining the One, he lives; losing the One, he dies. Not a single day can pass without the One.\n\nThus we know: Heaven’s One, Earth’s One, the valley’s One—these three cycle endlessly, ascending and descending, mutually generating, alternating as end and beginning. Though things possess the One, they abandon it and thus cannot retain it.\n\nIn ancient times, Fuxi first drew the Eight Trigrams, beginning with a single line to form Qian, declaring it \"firm and unceasing,\" yet it must reach its end. He then added another line to pair with it, and thus two Qians became Kun. Some say he softened Qian’s hardness to create Kun, so that hardness and softness complemented each other, movement and stillness harmonized, and stability was achieved. Qian and Kun are the keys, giving rise to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the male and female of Qian and Kun. When Kan and Li transform below, they generate Dui and Gen, which are the male and female of Kan and Li. Male and female unite to become husband and wife; husband and wife conceive and become parents; parents age and become elders. Herein lies the principle of the Prior and Posterior Heavens, cycling endlessly in mutual generation.\n\nThose who cultivate the body rely on a single art or skill to sustain themselves; those who refine life embrace the One of yin and yang to preserve their spirit; those who govern a household return to one wife and one concubine to secure their home. All these are called \"attaining the One,\" and thus body and mind find stability.\n\nLaozi embraced the One to discourse on the Dao, his five thousand words distilling the essence of the Dao into wondrous efficacy, while virtue aligns with hidden yin. Of virtues easier to transmit, Yan Yuan did not stray from benevolence for three months—benevolence is righteousness, is virtue, and thus his virtue could be passed on. Of the Dao harder to transmit, the *Hong Fan* lists five blessings: the first is wealth—wealth is property, is fortune, and thus one may receive the Dao.\n\nBorn between Heaven and Earth, some uphold benevolence and perfect virtue, some guard wealth and achieve fortune—Heaven’s endowment is not equal. Wealth relies on divination to reveal its efficacy; righteousness listens to lawsuits to settle disputes. Yet the Dao does not value teachers, nor virtue rely on resources. How then can the pursuit of righteousness achieve completion, surpassing the study of wealth?\n\nThus rare treasures must be firmly grasped, while easily heard matters often fade away. Offering coins to sacrifice to the altars of soil and grain is no different from tribute; privately setting up shrines to conceal spirits is no different from accepting bribes. As the ancients said: \"The Dao is not idly transmitted, just as worldly sentiments drive alchemists to seek arts in vain.\" At their extreme, they hide certain texts or secretly imitate their forms. Those who seek masters and inquire of the Dao, yet go a lifetime without transmission—when no trace remains to guess, they blame only themselves; what cause for resentment?\n\nSome say: \"The Dao is not untransmitted, nor must it be transmitted through wealth. Even humble and esteemed gentlemen may scorn the Dao upon hearing it.\" The Dao branches into many schools, but lest this Way vanish from the world, if one finds a worthy recipient, the Dao burdens the person. Those who casually copy scriptures dare not append their words; those who falsely claim to possess gold cannot entrust them with their treasures.\n\nFormerly, officials hastened to attain the Dao, and many courtesans once achieved immortality. Thus they discerned favor and disgrace, understood skill and clumsiness, excelled in listening yet suddenly awakened, and though deceived, were not deluded.\n\nNow, worldly learning forgets the root to chase the branch, loses the Dao to cultivate virtue, regards ten thousand as the most noble of numbers, and the One as the basest. Hearing of non-being, they mock; hearing of being, they sneer. The Dao shelters under the One’s protection, while the One is the Dao’s taboo. Though many scholars clamor about embracing the One, guarding the One, uniting the One, attaining the One—mere names truly bear no weight, like seeing a square and not valuing the medicine.\n\nThus the One cannot be easily described in form or words. When words are insufficient, one chants and sings; when that is insufficient, one sighs in lament—still insufficient.\n\nTo study the Dao yet lose the One’s substance and function is like a thousand gold pieces easily obtained, yet a drop of water hard to dispel. The ancients who attained the Dao attained the One. Those who cultivated the great perfection of the supreme vehicle roamed the mysterious realm, entered the gate of all wonders, refined the Great Mystery’s One, and widely spread the celestial black writ, the primordial talismanic water, to save the dying world. Some say they \"took from excess to supplement deficiency\"; others say they \"harmonized mercury and lead, sparing both sides harm.\"\n\nOnly foolish men and women corrupt the Dao and disrupt truth, wantonly harming one another. Filial sons who lose the Dao cut their flesh to save their parents, only to cause both parent and child to perish! Do they not know the One cannot be sacrificed?\n\nThe scriptures say: \"The Dao has three thousand six hundred gates; attaining one, all matters are complete.\" Thus the One is the master key of the mysterious pass, the central lamp of the awakened instant—no lock remains unopened, no depth remains unilluminated.\n\nIn my middle years, I groped for the mystery with empty hands and awakened to the Dao, painfully reflecting on the many hardships of piercing through. Fortunate to have gained it from the four directions, not through mere effort but through no loss, I record this for universal salvation.\n\n*Quatrains on Fire Timing and Practice*\n\nLong life has a secret, yet no work is done,\nWaiting for impermanence, feet tread on emptiness.\nTelling of mercury and lead, they only laugh—\nHow can they recognize the master’s breath?\n\nGold essence and wood liquid lie east and west apart,\nDrawn back and moved into the earthen crucible.\nWhen the five phases return to the One’s nature,\nWho can match the alchemical work of elixir refinement?\n\nThe numinous sprout grows the root of the Dao,\nWhen the flower blooms, the moon becomes full.\nThis is the true black descending from the five directions,\nCalled true mercury, also named lead.\n\nWithin the sun is the crow, yin gold red;\nWithin the moon is the hare, yang fire white.\nWhen crow essence and hare blood merge into the elixir,\nOrdinary mercury and lead cannot be refined.\n\n**The Sun’s Essence and Moon’s Spirit**\n\nThe sun’s essence gathers in *mao*, where *mao* belongs to the hare;\nThe moon’s spirit dwells in *you*, where *you* belongs to the fowl.\nTo refine the elixir, return to the root and establish the foundation—\nSimply shift the fowl and hare back to east and west.\n\nThe hexagram *Ren*’s Crone descends from the jade terrace,\nTransforming into the turning jade and

into a numinous substance—the sacred silver embryo.\nWith mercury and lead as this empty chamber,\nThe body’s successor generates the dragon, bones and qi made true.\n\nThe fire-timing of the

stream, the peach of immortality ripens;\nOn Xuanshan’s slopes, the fire-jujube glows red.\nWait for the black mist and slanderous rain to pass,\nThen pluck them to offer the aged immortal.\n\nEvery person has a flask of mercury,\nYet young and old take different paths—how could it be absent?\nAlas, they cast it aside without a thought,\nScattering the pearl of eternal countenance as common dust.\n\nTo still the heart is easy; to subdue the kidneys is hard—\nA hundred days of preserving essence is already a feat.\nWhen the night is full and the sky cold, one fears nocturnal emission;\nHasten to seek the great medicine to transmute cinnabar.\n\nTo accumulate essence and retain qi is no idle matter—\nPrimordial qi nourishes the body, harmonizing the hundred vessels.\nHow many fools lack the fortune to preserve it,\nDaring to sigh over moxa burned at the navel?\n\nThe arts of the bedchamber must never be practiced;\nDo not speak of the \"Gate of Death\" as a path to life.\nWithin the Cauldron of Lesser Yin lies boundless treasure—\nNot all heroes with ambition can contend for it.\n\nThe Xian Pool’s grotto is the Water Immortal’s abode,\nWhere a single peach tree blooms a thousand times.\nHow many have lost their lives plucking its flowers,\nMistaking their concubines’ mourning robes for truth?\n\nThe old man clings to the flowery brothel in search of youth—\nHow can the heart for the Dao compare to the heart for desire?\nMarching the ghostly path is ever perilous;\nThe frail, bare-chested elder embraces the tiger in sleep.\n\nAs the ancients said, \"To love virtue is like loving beauty\"—\nYet from dawn to dusk, one remains deluded.\nThe rich vie to learn the arts of yin absorption,\nBoasting of what they cannot practice.\n\nWu maidens and Yue

nailing peach charms above the door.\n\nTo master spirit union without bodily union,\nThe empty blossoms of yang’s allure will fall away of themselves.\nOnly then can one take up the alms bowl to subdue dragons and tigers—\nTo invite them upon oneself is to have no escape.\n\nA single drop of Meng Spring is the medicine’s material;\nThe mortal embryo, bathed in it, becomes a numinous embryo.\nTo return to the root and revive life is to know the crucial gate—\nTo revert to the origin and return to the source is to be reborn.\n\nIn later years, one probes the mysteries half-drunk, half-sober,\nUnable to fully grasp the *Yin Fu* or the *Dao and Its Virtue*.\nOnce the stew is seasoned, the host must be the basin—\nLife’s mandate first follows the Northern Dipper’s script.\n\nThe Dao is founded upon the Mysterious Female to establish the elixir’s base;\nWithin the *Wu-Ji* Palace, *Kan* and *Li* are forged.\nWithout true lead to restrain true mercury,\nWho can nurture the

sits in Dao until his hair turns white,\nShattering the monstrous bag—yet not a drop remains.\n\nThe *Kui* and *E* move from *Kan* to seek *Li*;\nReversing yin and yang is the proper time.\nAwaken the

can be glimpsed.\nHeaven is not old, for it constantly revolves;\nMan’s will is fickle, discoursing for but a moment.\n\nA man severs white to transform essence into blood;\nA woman severs red to transform blood into essence.\nThough not yet immortals of Penglai,\nThey are called the Infant Brother and the Marvelous Maiden.\n\nTo revive life and return to the origin, the Dao’s darkness abides;\nThe unbroken divine water moistens the numinous root.\nEven in old age, one clings to the bedchamber’s treasures—\nYet at a hundred years, one may still beget descendants.\n\nAt thirty, blood and qi are strong;\nOne laughs at those who speak of the Dao and elixir formulas.\nWith rice in the kitchen, morning cooking is easy;\nWithout oil in the lamp, the night’s work is frantic.\n\nAt fifty, to refine the elixir is already too late—\nQi declines, the body remains, called a \"walking corpse.\"\nHow many now resolve to seek the furnace and cauldron,\nOnly to raise children in the

not yet sufficient cultivation.\nIf one can extinguish desire and return to ultimate bliss,\nEven the skull must sigh with Zhuang Zhou.\n\nClinging to stubborn emptiness is a grievous error—\nSoul scattered, spirit dispersed, all ends in death.\nWho in this world lacks dragons and tigers within?\nYet they say the body is refined over countless kalpas.\n\nThe affairs of rebirth and death are a labyrinth;\nBuddhas transform sentient beings by accumulating good causes.\nPointing to the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss,\nThey speak of attaining human form in myriad ways.\n\nAsk the crucial ford between the Gate of Death and the Gate of Life—\nBuddhas speak of extinction; the Dao speaks of ascent.\nEmpty talk seems near, yet profound discourse is distant—\nThus the world reveres monks.\n\nSeeking months within years, hours within days,\nLong abiding by the furnace, yet still unaware.\nOn cold nights, they clamor to sit with alms bowls,\nOnly to guard against essence leakage while singing verses.\n\nWith a penchant for solitude and weary of broad learning,\nHow can one know that guarding the One is still a side door?\nMistaking one’s own body for a stinking skin-bag,\nInsisting on long life is but idle talk.\n\nReciting sutras to avert calamity, performing exorcisms—\nThe ultimate meaning is clear; do not waver in doubt.\n\nThose who guard the Dao and seal themselves in retreat practice water and fire,\nYet whence come tiger-wolves and willow rods?\nThe Five Immortals cultivate the Dao by different methods—\nWhen the celestial cycles turn, what befalls you?\n\nWhen the power of Water virtue waxes, yin affairs prevail,\nThough the Mystery Gate is expounded, ghostly works abound.\nThe Dao teaches the Three Vehicles: gods, ghosts, and immortals,\nSitting in death or standing in liberation—yet life leaves no trace.\n\nA corpse left upon the earth is still called death—\nHmph! What profundity lies in their mutterings?\nJade nectar congeals thickly, golden elixir grows dense,\nSealed behind closed doors, refining in solitude, leaving no human trace.\n\nGuard the spirit carelessly, and essence will leak;\nDreaming of summons and omens, delusion breeds misfortune.\nPrimal talismanic water, primal lamp—\nThese are the dark essences of the Prior Heaven.\n\nSince you pledged to refine the elixir,\nNone in this world can now practice it.\nIn mountain forests dwell foolish men,\nWho gladly forsake fame and profit, never seeking them.\n\nIf all the myriad things are quiescent extinction,\nHow can one laugh and wait for their nonexistence?\nNobles and ministers, scholars and worthies,\nCherish essence, preserve life—do not beg Heaven.\n\nHuman life’s essence and marrow are not bestowed by Heaven;\nIn vain do they burn incense to pray for long years.\nSun and moon soar high into the Purple Court—\nEven amid bustling work, the practice may yet be pursued.\n\nHolding office while guarding the Dao presents no obstacle,\nYet I fear their conduct may not be pure.\nGolden elixir reverses aging, restores youth,\nSeeking the mysterious in the life-gate, the nature-school is fulfilled.\n\nIf boots are torn and not patched with leather,\nFine silks cannot mend them.\nWithin every person lies cinnabar—\nOrdinary mercury, common lead—nothing more may be added.\n\nHow can the unlearned perceive this?\nThey burn miscellaneous stones, calling them \"yellow sprouts.\"\nGuard the One with single-minded devotion—even death is rest;\nHaste is like quenching thirst, yet satiety is hard to attain.\n\nTo congeal the immortal embryo, one must gather the Pāramitā,\nSeize the queen bee and place her within.\nWhen Heavenly Gui and Heavenly Ren are fully recognized,\nOne is destined to become an immortal.\n\nLet the Purple Mansion bear no name—\nIn the end, I alone can refine mercury and lead.\n\n*Valley Spirit*, Scroll the Upper—Concluded\n*Valley Spirit*, Scroll the Lower\n\n**Five Blessings: The Mysterious Nest**\n*By Lin Yuan, the Divine Phoenix*\n\n**The Art of the Pitch-Pot, Illustrated**\nA golden vase casts wooden arrows—\nQi’s cavity draws the spirit home.\nWith heart upright and form aligned,\nThe mechanism nurtures and unfolds its power.\n\nLu Lüzi said: *\"To honor Buddhism is to depart from office and guard the abiding; to study the Dao is to seek the mysterious in the Water Palace.\"*\nThis saying is most apt!\n\n**The Diagram of Embracing Primal Simplicity**\n*On the Empty Fame of Stillness Practice*\n\nIn cultivating the Dao, there are five stages, each a step toward immortality. Let us examine them:\n\nTo refine destiny (*ming*), one must preserve perception and presence, taking the body as the elixir chamber, qi as lead and mercury. Following the movements of yang’s work, supplemented by medicinal tonics, one cures illness and is called a *Human Immortal*.\n\nFurther, by safeguarding the spirit with the Jade Token and embracing a weighty, pure, and unadulterated nature, one grasps the image while forgetting words, achieving longevity in the world—this is an *Earth Immortal*.\n\nWithdrawing behind walls to sever worldly ties, concealing one’s traces to evade summons, and refining the form with Golden Fluid until both form and spirit attain subtlety—this is a *Divine Immortal*.\n\nMastering the pivot of creation’s mechanism, aligning with Heaven’s Dao, enduring great trials, observing the mysterious precepts and prohibitions, forgetting speech and action while broadly cultivating benevolence, silently accumulating merit—one awaits the fulfillment of qi and the perfection of spirit. Then, transcending into a body of pure, light, harmonious qi, one returns to the Grotto-Heavens, attaining the rank of *Heavenly Immortal*.\n\nThese four ranks, though distinct in grade, follow the gradual progression of destiny-refinement. Thus, their principles yield inevitable fruition.\n\nAs for refining one’s nature (*xing*), one must trust in the void, taking qi as the master and the body as a temporary abode. Embracing yin qi to guard stillness, one unites the myriad threads, stills the hundred thoughts. Though eating and drinking do not burden the heart, the Four Great Elements remain inert, the Five Viscera idle. Through prolonged seated practice, the body becomes free of chronic illness, and toil goes unnoticed.\n\nWith diligent effort, one gradually attains stillness and stability. When essence (*jing*) ceases to leak, both nature-water and spirit become limpid. Inwardly observing, the heart is absent; outwardly observing, form vanishes; gazing afar, things dissolve. One enters true stillness.\n\nYang’s *hun* gradually wanes, yin’s *po* gradually prevails. The essence of *po* and the water of nature both grow luminous. In stillness, one forgets—this is called *entering samādhi*. Only then does one sense the body within light; in vagueness, the body disappears. Nature expands freely—this is called *attaining nature*.\n\nWith a pure and expansive heart, the center is empty yet responsive. Profoundly, one foresees the fortunes and misfortunes of human affairs, discerns past and future, yet remains unaware of one’s own afflictions. Some, in yin’s collapse, grow fearful, dreading the legions of demons. Exertion dulls wisdom; in dullness, serpents and tigers appear before them.\n\nWithout cause, yin spirits attach to their nature, perverse influences enter their bodies, ghosts and spirits rush to serve them—yet they merely endure the labor. The verification of stillness practice, compared to embracing the One, is also said: *\"If one can remain constantly clear and still, Heaven and Earth all return to them.\"*\n\nWhen yin essence flourishes, corpse-demons flourish. Unaware, one plunges into deep abysses—yet all can emerge of their own accord. As the saying goes: *\"The Dao rises a foot, the demon rises ten.\"*\n\nSome abandon the body to tread peril, indulge in empty thoughts to forget hunger and cold, or with fierce qi eat without excreting. Forgetting form, they feel no pain; in corpse-like trance, they harm themselves without injury. Facing execution, they remain unscathed; in suspended breath, smoke fails to dry them. When nature perishes, they wholly forsake sleep.\n\nAll such \"benefits\" arise from clinging to life and shunning death, free of fear—yet they only astonish and delude. Far from the Dao, they are but fleeting illusions, ultimately inescapable from death.\n\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme and suddenly stirs—not by host or guest, but by thieving perversity—movement becomes uncontrollable. Essence scatters, and one speaks in verses, displays teachings, manifests forms to transform the vulgar, or abandons being for emptiness. Some slander the true wind—this is the loss of the heart, where the desire to prevail lingers, not the Dao’s doing. Though called \"attaining the Dao,\" in truth, nothing is attained.\n\nBorn between Heaven and Earth, one holds the eternal golden celestial drop of spirit-water, the embryo complete with both male and female. Thus, when nature stabilizes, water clarifies; when clear, it reflects things. A pool’s water, when limpid, breeds fish and turtles; a mountain with springs harbors spirits—when contained, it breeds demons.\n\nThe vulgar hear of sorcery: entering a home, one gazes into the water in a bowl to perform theft—how much more so with the yin talisman of nature-water! For the cultivator who enters the realm of empty samādhi, if endowed with innate spiritual bones and an unwavering heart, they may awaken to the turning light and returning illumination, restoring life to its root. Sealing the mouth to sacrifice to the turtle, closing the eyes to cross the bridge—some can transfer the spirit upward, exit the corpse and re-enter the shell, coming and going without obstruction. Truly attaining the Dao of *Ghost Immortals*, realizing the fruit of the *Empty King*—one in ten thousand achieves this, a rare feat.\n\nYet though called \"accomplished,\" can one feed hunger with porridge made of no rice? If, swayed by external things, heterodoxies arise, and one mistakes the demon’s chatter for one’s own ability—alas! The calamity of loss is near. Who would say one dies without resentment?\n\nAlas! How lamentable!\n\nHeaven’s Dao constantly cherishes all things, leaving none abandoned. Ghosts and spirits have no fixed disposition; when the Dao declines, they are lost. Some say the ghostly path is easy—how much more so for disaster?\n\nConsider the Ghost Immortal’s attainment: unable to roam the light and pure, nor retain form in the heavy and dense, they dwell in the dim and distant, their thoughts alone—what is it like? Observing Heaven and Earth’s myriad things: first yin, then yang; from nothing to being; first emptiness, then fullness; abandoning delusion to seek truth; first ghosts, then spirits; laying down arms to cultivate culture; first merit, then skill; from coarse to refined.\n\nAll things, once existent, gradually decay, collapse, disperse, and perish, returning to formlessness.\n\nAll beings, human and otherwise, follow the flowing course of qi’s movement. Agitation overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat; weakness overcomes strength; thought overcomes fear.\n\nHeaven’s Dao: yin ever prevails over yang. Human Dao: stillness ever prevails over motion. Humans are endowed with excessive yin substance, hence the three *hun* and seven *po*.\n\nThe path of immortality often begins auspiciously; the ghostly path often begins inauspiciously. The *Yijing*’s transformations likewise state: one aligns with ghosts and spirits in fortune and misfortune. Yet in worldly affairs and literary principles, a hundred things are empty for every one that is real.\n\nTo abide in motion is also the Dao—when motion reaches its extreme, stillness emerges, and in stillness, spirit congeals. To abide in stillness is also the Dao—when stillness reaches its extreme, motion returns, and in motion, qi scatters.\n\nObserve the hen brooding her eggs: when water is poured over them, those that float and stir hold life; those that sink and remain still hold none. No life means no spirit—this is a principle as clear as day.\n\nThe sage, observing the cycle, laments the ruin of things, sighing: “Better there were no things at all, so one would not witness their decay.”\n\nDivination texts state: Heaven and Earth, years, months, days, and hours each have their moments of emptiness—how much more so for humans? Ordinary people’s deaths and burials last no more than three years. But for physicians, shamans, diviners, sages, loyal ministers, and righteous scholars who establish merit, benefit the world, and leave behind a name—those whose virtuous deeds extend their grace to later generations—are praised by the people. Thus, their names endure in the spirit realm, and their sacrifices are offered. Though loyal, serene, righteous, and brave, their spirits manifest in the yin realm.\n\nOthers, who merely admire lofty purity or reckless simplicity and have temples named after them, possess only empty reputations. In office, they share the same emoluments; in death, they share the same vulgar fate. Though they may have temples, they receive no offerings. Their deaths return to impermanence—no different from those who, in solitary yin, cling to stillness.\n\n---\n\n**Water Tune Prelude**\n\nThunder lies buried in the earth,\nSprings well forth beneath the mountain’s base.\nThe pivot’s mechanism aligns—\nOnly the noble man can fathom its workings.\n\nThe first nine: “The hidden dragon—do not act.”\nThe top nine: “The exalted dragon has regrets.”\nThe dark ford gathers in the Yellow Palace.\nGreat Accumulation brings advantage—\nExcellently succeeding, nurturing the primal male.\n\nDismantling the primordial chaos,\nSeeking the cauldron’s essence,\nCrafting the *Cantong Qi*.\nWith sincerity filling the jar,\nThe Dao flows abundantly, vast and bountiful.\n\nRepaying intoxication with golden grains from the valley,\nEmbracing decay in a cracked urn,\nRetiring to dine in public service.\nReceiving restraint through doors and windows,\nIts Dao endures without end.\n\n---\n\nAwakening to the celestial immortal’s secret,\nPenetrating the patriarch’s barrier.\nInverting *kan* and *li*,\nReturning to the root and reviving destiny—\nA matter of moments.\n\nNeither fasting nor precepts,\nNeither action nor silence,\nNor seated meditation in perfection.\nWhy then do fellow disciples\nForgo sleep and forget meals?\n\nSeek the yellow sprout,\nCapture one’s own mercury,\nBind the returning elixir.\nWorldly affairs are burdensome,\nYet none touch the Dao.\n\nNeither abandon wife nor chase concubines,\nNeither cast off children nor forsake office.\nSimply drink the Great Mystery’s wine—\nEach one may ride the phoenix.\n\n---\n\nThe great medicine, the golden elixir’s ancestor,\nExists before the division of mixed essence.\nHard and soft split apart—\nDifferent names, yet both emerge from mercury and lead.\n\nGrasping the Dao’s reversal of things,\nRefining this divine water of the Flowery Pond,\nExtending the pattern to unite with the mystery.\nThe double eight is the crucial juncture—\nHusband and wife reunite.\n\nNoon arrives at *shen*,\n*Yin* rises at *zi*,\nCirculating the celestial orbit.\nThe hexagrams align in *Jiji*—\nYin must await yang’s extremity to assume power.\n\nThree and five: *geng* gives birth, *jia* reaches fullness.\nGradually, *Zhongfu* conceives—\nIn ten months, the sacred embryo is complete.\nInside and out, radiant and crimson,\nThe great creation corresponds to pure *qian*.\n\n---\n\nForm and appearance nurture the *Kundulun*,\nFully attaining the *Pratyekabuddha*.\nThe great thousandfold world of self and others—\nAll named the immeasurable *asamkhya*.\n\nMen dwell in Jetavana’s almshouse,\nWomen in the Sea of Awakening’s gate—\nLove and desire are the roots of suffering.\nIf one delights in the *Lana* path,\nThe reward of blessings still exceeds the term.\n\n---\n\nCharity like Sudhana’s,\nTreasure like Prabhūta’s,\nBroadly seeking teachers through karmic excellence.\nSuddenly transcending the other shore,\nScooping from Cao Creek.\n\nThe Buddha spoke of the *Srotāpanna* fruit,\nI attained the *Arhat* path—\nThus realizing bodhi.\nThe first *pāramitā*:\nListen carefully and contemplate.\n\n---\n\nTrees, though old, may be grafted;\nCan humans, though old, be left to wither?\nThe Mysterious Origin feeds on the mother—\nThe returning elixir entering the mouth is the true plan.\n\nBegging the western neighbor’s red brew,\nSeeking the eastern neighbor’s white wine—\nTwo into one gourd.\nBoiled in my cauldron,\nThe jade hare and golden crow dance.\n\nRescuing decline,\nReviving the old woman,\nRestoring youth like a fledgling.\nEssence fills the marrow,\nBody and mind ever robust.\n\nCommon sayings claim immortals renounce desire,\nIdly speak of true persons having no thoughts—\nEven heaven’s husband is moved by mechanisms.\nI say: this is no ordinary Dao,\nIt does not bind itself in solitude.\n\n---\n\nCreation’s game is fleeting and false,\nHeaven’s net spreads wide as mugwort.\nLifting the veil of life and death—\nThe hinge’s turn reveals King Yama’s presence.\n\nThe six paths’ wheel devours and consumes,\nA single qi’s circulation governs high and low.\nExamining the orifices to bestow life—\nOnly then may one avoid being cast into the skin’s hub,\nYet even then, meeting good parents is rare.\n\nFriends are many, but those who listen are few.\nDeception and entanglement arise from haste.\nHeaven and hell—\nBelieve in Shen and Lü,\nInvestigate Han’s constancy.\n\nPlowing hunger, few regrets,\nThe Dao’s valley doubts and lacks—\nYet actions skillfully align.\nTo escape yin and yang’s construction,\nRefine lead frost in the golden crucible.\n\n---\n\n**Diagram of Wood and Metal’s Separation in Function**\n**Diagram of Primordial Qi’s Generation**\n**Discourse on Primordial Qi**\n\nAt the inception of primordial qi, it is but a single millet grain, a dewdrop, a water bead. From the boundless kalpas of beginningless time, within the obscuring haze of coalescing dust, it harbors and congeals a single droplet of water’s essence. Nurtured within, like a basket bearing an egg, it germinates from the base—thus it comes to be! Forcibly named the Dao, the Numinous Treasure, born of yin yet sustaining it, white within and black without, its dark essence establishes the martial, the warp of the Northern Dipper. Thus, the inner white transforms the po-soul, paradoxically belonging to yin; the outer black alters the hun-soul, paradoxically belonging to yang—this is yin’s containment and yang’s embrace.\n\nThe inner yin, stirred by yang’s movement, follows and emerges, becoming misty vapors. The outer yang, awaiting yin’s stillness, steps inward, initiating the swirling of nascent qi. As yin first emerges, it is unseen—termed \"elusive and indistinct,\" akin to cold mist rising. As yang first enters, it is unheard—termed \"profound and obscure,\" suddenly like the formless, generating warmth. Once conjoined, they blend in undifferentiated substance, accumulating from small to great, neither pure yin within nor pure yang without.\n\nMoreover, yin qi as disposition favors expansion, leisurely dispersion, desiring full emergence. Yet as it gradually emerges, it does not forsake its offspring, forming embryonic radiance—appearing like mist generating dampness. Yang qi as nature favors nurturance, harmonious fusion, desiring full inwardness. Yet as it gradually enters, it cannot depart its mother, forming portents of dawn—warmth flickering in union and separation, generating heat. The outer yin increasingly coalesces; the inner yang increasingly congeals, binding into chaos. Its form returns to the origin, establishing celestial patterns—this is the dark enveloping the yellow.\n\nNow, the dark pertains to water, the utmost essence of primordial qi, accumulating to fullness. The yellow pertains to fire, the generative spirit of residual qi, blazing within its bounds. Thus, within this chaos, only a single gleam of sunlight sinks into the water! Yin qi lies beyond the heavens, thus unable to rest, ever fluttering like a mother soothing a sleeping child. Yang qi resides within the fluid, thus unable to move, ever stirring like a chick awaiting the hen’s nourishment. Through prolonged nurturance, dryness arises within the yellow. Once dryness is born, the dark essence erodes and desiccates; water dries and qi empties—from this emptiness, wind is born. When dryness reaches its extreme within, thunder resounds!\n\nThus, within the heavens’ womb, the Four Symbols reside. Within, wind strives to rise yet cannot stir; water strives to flow yet cannot; fire strives to flame yet cannot ascend; thunder strives to surge yet cannot erupt. Gradually, they clash and contend, even to the point of war. Wind aids water’s force, creating surging waves; thunder aids fire’s force, adding vehemence. Until, through fierce collision, it shatters! Shattering is division—this is the opening of heaven. Thus, thunder quakes and resounds; wind lifts the vast expanse; fire’s qi ascends and descends; water’s fluid flows and pours. The ancients who governed transformation secretly designated wind and thunder as Pan Gu’s names, that later generations might not lightly fathom creation’s workings.\n\nOnce heaven divides, primordial qi transforms. The lighter qi ascends from below, congealing into the celestial abode. The heavy residue of primordial qi’s accumulated fluid follows the base it bears—this is true water. Tracing back to the time since heaven first took form, until chaos had not yet shattered, its vastness spanned but a hundred li. Generally, a person today may traverse a hundred li in a day—thus thunder resides within it. Only by firmly nurturing the sound of a hundred li can one shake the fury of ten li, for fire is its mother. Fire’s conflagration in a day does not exceed a hundred li before subsiding—thus we know thunder and fire’s command are constrained. Water may flow ten thousand li in a day, and wind likewise—thus we know water and wind’s governance are unbounded! Therefore, thunder’s strike scorches objects; wind’s breath dampens garments—each bears the imprint of its mother qi’s endowment.\n\nOnce the hundred-li heaven divides, it becomes a thousand li, gradually extending to ten thousand li. Wind expands according to direction; thunder surges according to position. The outer residual qi spreads and arranges; the inner primordial qi’s portents circulate and enclose. Through kalpas of response and transformation, it becomes impossible to fathom its myriad li! Some ask: wind and thunder share the same cavern—why can wind blow ten thousand li while thunder only shakes a hundred? It is said: wind, stirred by cold qi, blows water—this is primordial qi’s surplus, called yin qi, malign qi, perverse qi, easy to accumulate yet hard to disperse. The yin spirit governs the world with frequent recklessness. Thunder, borrowing dryness to shake fire, is residual qi’s selflessness, called yang qi, wrathful qi, righteous qi, hard to arouse yet easy to calm. The yang spirit governs the world with constant fidelity. Thus, when thunder unfolds, its sound weakens; when it surges, its fury abates.\n\nWater, fire, wind, and thunder are the Four Symbols. Wind is but spirit; thunder is but resonance; fire is but light; water alone possesses substance. The sun is but fire’s light. Within the celestial vault, only water possesses the potential to manifest substance. Water’s upward correspondence gives rise to the Northern Asterism, and thereafter, water’s qi, the sun’s reflection, through transformation, generates the moon. Yet water is the mother of both prior and posterior heaven.\n\nWater begets wind; wind in turn stirs water, raising waves into foam. Thunder shakes water, churning it into floating duckweed. The sun bakes water, congealing sediment into brine. The moon illuminates water, settling the chamber into mud. Mud accumulates and gives birth; worms and insects transform together—thus earth is formed.\n\nWind scatters and stirs dust; the sun scorches and hardens sand. When heavy dew descends and water nourishes the earth, moss and lichen first arise. Then come creeping weeds, followed by tender shoots, their fleeting growth and decay gradually thickening the soil. Grasses transform into bamboo, branches flourish into trees; over time, grasses bear ears, trees grow trunks, and herbs yield fruit. Spring’s flourishing and autumn’s shedding all rot and return to the earth, which grows ever richer until the land takes shape.\n\nAs tree roots intertwine with earth and piled soil solidifies, over time they harden into stone. Thus, within the bounds of heaven and earth, all that possesses form and image reduces to but two things: wood and stone. Ancient trees, infused with the qi of heaven, earth, clouds, and mist, develop essence and sap; over time, they transform into birds and dragons, into demons and men. Endowed with spirit and vitality, when shaped by karmic conditions, the limbs, hair, and body of humankind derive from wood—thus enabling leaping, drumming, grasping, bending, and stretching, all expressions of its nature. Red stone, nurtured by water and earth, refined by the sun and moon, develops blood and milk; over time, it transforms into toads and tigers, into sheep and women. With mechanisms transparent and fluid, when driven by thunder, the skull, abdomen, and bones of the human body derive from stone—thus enabling sitting, crouching, dwelling, and embracing stillness, all expressions of its essence. Wood as male and stone as female, once united, conceive and bear sons and daughters, completing the human form.\n\nWith the emergence of humankind, transformation and nurturance diverge. Even without mating, insects and creatures arise from wombs and embryos; young and old depend on one another, preserving offspring. Species differentiate, and myriad forms take shape. Those that forage in the wilds and fields develop natures suited to flight and movement; those that gather near hearths and settlements gain wit and discernment, beauty and ugliness. Tracing the origin of men and women born of wood and stone reveals the shift from insentience to sentience. The moist nature of stone gives humans their molars; the withering nature of wood brings death. All living forms are partial and contingent, yet the human body is most refined, endowed with the fullness of yin and yang’s primordial qi.\n\nHeavenly spirits and earthly deities are all governed by humankind. It is further said: Since the opening of heaven and earth, their form resembles an overturned vessel. Within it, primordial qi generates and transforms; various qi ascend, congealing and accumulating at the vessel’s rim, forming the vaulted expanse like soot settled at the bottom of a cauldron. Depending on the thickness of the ascending qi below, over time it hangs suspended, forming layers and masses. Nurtured by the qi of the sun, moon, cold, and heat, it is smelted and refined into ore, its core harboring the essence of metals and jade. When defiled by turbid qi, it falls as hills, mounds, and caves. Nüwa’s smelting of stone to mend the heavens drew upon its primordial qi, leaving its raw substance in the world—these are the five metals and treasures. Those yet unrefined remain as cinnabar, lead, alum, saltpeter, and the like.\n\nAs the vaulted expanse accumulates qi over time, the weight of its raw substance gradually sinks. Above it, the hollow emptiness of Kongtong arises. All things, day and night, exhale qi that ascends, borne aloft by the blazing tips of these vapors. The scorching, shadowless qi penetrates the empty expanse, condensing into the sun’s spirit. The liquid qi of all things mingles below, forming the numinous essence of stars and sun. The qi of transformation manifests as lesser stars, hence called \"lodgings,\" for they retain light for a single night. Observing the Dao of heaven, one sees that in its beginning, it possessed no numen—it contained the reflections of all images, its inner radiance serving as its spirit. It had no deity; the blazing brilliance of the qi enveloping all things became its god. Without external form or inner shadow, even the sagest cannot behold its face, though the worthy may align their hearts with it.\n\nSome say the destruction of heaven and earth arises from no other cause: the excessive generation of the two qi weakens water’s power and hollows the earth. Primordial qi is water; residual qi is earth. Water flows day and night, scouring rivers and marshes, so river sources shift their courses and riverbanks lack fixed shores. Thus, the topography of Yu’s era reflects the prosperity and decline of north and south; the sands of Qiantang respond to the gathering and dispersal of east and west. As days pass and months return, the world follows the transformation of ridges and valleys. When water’s flow reaches its limit, its force weakens. Moreover, the earth’s overabundant generation of life hollows the soil, rendering it unable to sustain itself. Minor collapses occur in low-lying areas; major ones cause total subsidence. When strength is exhausted and destiny fulfilled, even in collapse, there is a bottom. Yet the light of the sun and moon, scattered by the shock of collapse, vanishes.\n\nWhen the earth first subsides, life’s qi ceases and cold qi prevails. Heaven, left unsupported, becomes perilous. Within its darkness, all beings perish, returning to earth without residue. Three hundred and sixty years pass in the human world. When yin’s stillness reaches its extreme, yang stirs again; cold qi transforms into warmth, and warmth and cold interact, generating dampness. Once damp qi arises, it steams and spreads in all directions. The vaulted expanse, vast and desolate, becomes drenched and sodden, its vastness dissolving and collapsing. Another three hundred and sixty years pass, as it endures dampness and crumbles.\n\nExamining the structure of hills and ridges—layers of stone beneath layers of soil, piled and interwoven—reveals that the decay and destruction of heaven and earth have long existed. The rest and renewal of heaven and earth are the cessation of creation’s force to nurture qi, the Dao of yin and yang’s union, the principle of returning to the root and restoring life. Though called destruction, it is merely the generation of residual qi, accumulating to form a posterior heaven above and a hollow earth below, where substance settles and returns to soil. The prior heaven, however, knows no destruction, for its primordial qi endures, returning to regenerate. When damp qi flourishes and heat’s signs appear, extreme heat gives way to dryness, and yang qi arrives!\n\nThe pure and turbid divide! Radiance emerges, and all things draw upon their origin—another eighty-one years have passed in nine cycles of nine. Thus, heaven and earth’s single rest spans eight hundred years.\n\nI have heard elders say: eighteen thousand and eighty years after the opening of heaven, earth then came to be. Reasoning thus, heaven’s accumulated qi endures for ten thousand years, resting for eight hundred! In sum, it becomes evident that Qian descends to form Kun.\n\nFor heaven, one day contains twelve hours; in the human body, twelve meridians. A person’s weariness and awakening hinge on a single hour, aligning with the reckoning of rest. When heaven and earth collapse, their spirit does not perish. Thus the scripture states: the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Floating Radiance and the Primordial Heavenly Worthy are separated by countless kalpas—this is no falsehood. After their collapse, heaven rises higher and grows more distant; earth sinks lower and thickens; mountains accumulate and tower ever more loftily, like stones revealed as waters recede.\n\nIf heaven and earth did not rest, there would be no means for them to unfold; if an infant did not sleep, there would be no way for it to grow and transform.\n\nSomeone asked: How can the primordial heaven endure and attain long life?\nThe answer: Observe the image of heaven—it is like a covered vessel. Externally, there is no vast emptiness; peripherally, no leaking apertures. Though dark passes and earthen barriers lie within, they reside in its inner realms of brightness and obscurity, stillness and movement. The circulation of its primordial qi, along with its rest, occurs solely within it—thus it endures. Heaven envelops the myriad things, stealing their qi to nourish itself, and by this means attains long life.\n\nNow, heaven’s theft of the qi of things: there is no second heaven—it steals only from what is born within itself. Thus, the myriad things suffer no loss or violation; this is the natural theft it rightfully claims. Humans, too, can do this. Moreover, since humans share the same body, if they can steal from what they themselves possess, how much more can they steal from other things!\n\nYet in the human body, beyond the five viscera and six bowels, nothing else abides. Though every sip and bite enters from without, to seek long life solely from self-generation is difficult. Thus, the Yellow Emperor practiced the art of controlling women and lived to one thousand two hundred years. Qian Keng mastered the method of nurturing infants and enjoyed a lifespan of eight hundred. Looking back: grafting peach onto apricot, grafting mulberry onto elm; consuming the velvet of deer, eating the flesh of young animals; wearing furs, demanding bloody sustenance—all because their qi can supplement qi, their essence can stir essence. Though things differ, their primordial qi is the same.\n\nThe ancient sages said: draw near from the self, draw far from things. The world recites these words, yet few truly savor their meaning. In cultivating the Dao, one seeks attainment—through seeking attainment, it is called \"theft.\" Eating grain is theft; eating meat is theft. To become a thief who feeds the spirit, though theft it may be, no theft compares. If one can steal primordial qi from oneself and return it, then the realm of long life is easily attained! How then could one plot further, becoming a thief of unkindness?\n\nFurthermore, what is the primordial qi of humans? In its beginning, it is a single dewdrop of life within the qi of the beginningless. It gives birth to heaven, gives birth to earth, and through wood and stone, gives birth to humans. Extending to ancestors, it is the parents who give life to the body. What now resides within the human body is the single point of spirit-qi between the two kidneys—bestowed by the parents.\n\nNow, the union of yin and yang in heaven and earth, the coupling of the myriad things: it is the coupling of essence. Misrepresented, it is said to be blood. Once parents infuse their spirit into the Gate of Origin and the Cavern of Nurturing Yang, it is the root of the beginningless mystery, the original dewdrop—this is called primordial qi. Its form is indistinct, its image obscure, concealed within the essence-fluid—this is the water-body.\n\nIt governs the kidneys, containing and nurturing the yang soul, transforming to generate heart-qi. Heart-qi generates the pupils of the two eyes, dividing into clear and turbid. The clear qi of the right eye transforms into spirit-water, returning to the heart as fluid. The heart’s fluid transforms into blood, returning to the left kidney as essence. Essence transforms into qi, guarding the spirit as nature.\n\nThe turbid qi of the left eye ascends to generate brain marrow, forming the skull. Once complete, it descends to generate the spine, then the right kidney, pairing with the left kidney as the Gate of Life—or in women, the uterine palace—uniting hun and po souls. The hun generates the liver, heart, tongue, gallbladder, pericardium, small intestine, bladder, and penis. The po generates the lungs, throat, stomach, spleen, colon, large intestine, anus, and the constructive and defensive qi, combining to form the Triple Burner.\n\nThe hun governs the movement of blood and constructs the sinews, ligaments, and channels. The po transforms qi to move the defensive, generating flesh, bones, hair, and skin, completing the body, and thereafter the four limbs. In women, all is reversed, for they face north to receive the embryo. (This pertains to the mother’s pulse diagnosis.) Yet though male and female differ, both rely on the cubit pulse to determine life and death, equally decisive for fate.\n\nThe operation of primordial qi: it resides in the kidneys, passes through the heart, responds in the eyes—three palaces ascending and descending, a single qi circulating. Thus, the kidneys pair with the bladder, the heart with the small intestine, the eyes with the brain. These pairings are their gathering places. Knowing these pairings—this union, this return—one understands the qi’s egress and ingress: its intervals, its waxing and waning, its clarity and turbidity. This is the sign of illuminating the heart and perceiving nature.\n\nThe transformations of primordial qi divide into two forms: qi and fluid. Qi is called life; spirit is true mercury. Following movement and external contact, when awake, the spirit roams in the eyes; when eyes close, it returns to the heart; in sleep, it retreats to the kidneys; in silence, it gathers at the brows—this is the ascent and descent of qi.\n\nFluid is called nature; essence is true lead. In tranquil cultivation and internal return: in the kidneys, it is essence; reaching the liver, it becomes hun; reaching the heart, it becomes blood; reaching the spleen, it becomes rich marrow; reaching the pericardium, it becomes constructive vessels; reaching the lungs, it becomes po; reaching the Triple Burner, it becomes defensive qi; reaching the interstices, it becomes moving qi; reaching the brain, it becomes spirit-spring; descending to the nose, it becomes jade nectar; reaching the throat and tongue, it becomes numinous fluid. Entering the stomach, it gathers in the heart’s domain.\n\nThe constructive and defensive qi, once circulating the body, return to the heart, joining with the fluids of grain in the large intestine. At the colon, they separate the clear and turbid: the clear qi enters the small intestine, seeps through the kidneys to the bladder. The bladder returns to the original sea, the original sea regenerates qi—endless day and night.\n\nAt this moment, it is called the spirit returning to qi, qi reuniting with fluid. The noble person guards their solitude, attaining this as the minor return. When male and female dwell together in the chamber, one thing divides into two names: within yin lies hidden yang, called the Yellow Sprout; within yang lies the image of yin, named the White Snow Divine Talisman. Together, they are called the Knife-Point Elixir.\n\nThe method of cultivation: at the *zi* hour of yang within the human body, nourish with extraordinary water and advance with natural fire—\"natural\" here means following the proper timing. In but a moment’s effort, something arises from nothing, forming the sacred embryo. This is called \"seizing the workings of creation.\"\n\nIf one does not seek the oral instructions and further loses the company of those of the same kind, even the Jade Fluid will be absent—how then could the Golden Fluid exist? Merely abiding in contemplation and non-action, hoping for the union that forms the elixir, is truly delusion.\n\nWhen a person lacks root and foundation, the body lies in partial decay. Qi cannot linger, fluids have no place to return. As the years advance, qi ages, the form withers, fluids dry up. Failing to complete the Dao, illness becomes their worry, hunger and thirst their burden, old age and death their sorrow—how much more so when seized by the killing mechanisms of yin and yang?\n\nSomeone asks: What is meant by \"seizing\"?\n\nWhen it is the time of cold and heat, they harm the blood and vessels, weakening the spleen and stomach. When it is the time of thunder and lightning, they snatch the hun and po, startling the spirit from the body. When it is the time of yin rain, they extinguish the spirit’s vitality, causing dreams of swallowing yin qi. When it is the time of frost and snow, they pare away the flesh, inducing dreams of peril and seminal loss. When it is the time of famine, they wither the qi and constitution, dulling the senses and breeding foulness. When it is the time of pestilence, they rot the life, bringing maggots, blood, and premature death. When it is the time of war and weapons, they destroy the form and will, bringing great pain and separation.\n\nUnaware, people lose their rosy complexions to unseen withering—all these are the seizing of the killing mechanisms.\n\nSome say Heaven loves life and hates killing—could Heaven not be compassionate? Yet Heaven’s love of life is rooted in earthly qi: it nurtures the living qi of beings and corrupts their dead qi, just as the human abdomen cannot tolerate putrefaction.\n\nIf one can regulate and ingest original qi, it must rely on stomach qi as its foundation. Forsaking the coarse and rough, one offers the refined and pure; rejecting untimely foods, one partakes of the fresh. Casting off the stale and spoiled, one takes in the sweet and nourishing, filling the stomach qi so that original qi overflows.\n\nConfucius said: \"When sacrificing for the lord, do not keep the meat overnight.\" When a traveler slaughters a sheep, he must first sharpen the blade and stab. Some say to eat living flesh and discard dead blood—what was once hearsay is now proven true. This is cherishing the body and valuing life, knowing what harms and what benefits, and thus drawing near to the Dao.\n\nIf one mourns in houses of misfortune or illness, enters places of childbirth or taboo corpses, hears the lamentations of prisoners or sits in slaughterhouses awash with blood, or even binds oneself in unlawful fetters, all these scatter the spirit in terror.\n\nLittle do they know that original qi lodges in the human body like mist in the grass. Even the most careful guardian has no master for a hundred years. Nurture it, and it remains; disturb it, and it scatters. Scattered, it causes dizziness; severely so, one collapses.\n\nThose who courageously nurture original qi possess bodies and minds of penetrating clarity, hearts filled with solid sincerity. They have thoughts and compassion, resolve and fortitude. Even when tasting great bitterness, severing an arm, or cutting off a foot, their original qi hides in concealment, their countenance unchanged—suddenly, they die. Or in a single joy or anger, they perish. Yet if they live, their spirit remains undispersed. Those who cannot nurture it are vulgar, shallow, and ignorant, clinging to delusions and retreating from insight. Full of taboos and easily deceived, their qi has no steadfast abode, their spirit no silent dwelling. Some, through sorrow or rage, even take their own lives—how utterly foolish!\n\nNow, the essentials of original qi: that which is guarded within is called *upright qi*, *Grain Spirit*, *nature and life*. The remaining qi that responds externally is called *vast qi*, *responsive spirit*, *voice and appearance*.\n\nThus, the *Wang Shuhe Pulse Classic* states: \"If the responsive spirit moves, the hun and po rest within, and the life-giving pulse does not cease—this is the movement of the responsive spirit’s point. As long as the life pulse remains, one does not die.\"\n\nTherefore, Laozi said: \"Nature and life are ever-present.\" The Buddha said: \"Voice and appearance are all empty.\" The one speaks of the internal, the other of the external.\n\nYet deluded followers, failing to fathom profound principles, mistakenly point to the Buddha’s teachings, seeking the bliss of extinction. How could they know the words from the *Analects*: \"When the bird is about to die, its song is mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are kind\"—how lamentable! Alas!\n\nThe sages and worthies of old spoke of the Dao’s boundlessness, expounded the *Yi Jing*’s Supreme Polarity, discoursed on astronomy and geography, mastered the arts of archery, calligraphy, and mathematics, or traced the waxing and waning of the myriad things—yet most did not ground their teachings in primordial qi. When it came to exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, the very point where true work begins, they merely floated in vague talk of the constant Dao, refusing to take responsibility. What use are such hollow words, like disjointed bones and sinews, loosely bound together, all offering no benefit to self-cultivation?\n\nThus, Mencius spoke only of \"nurturing the vast and flowing qi,\" while Zhuangzi contented himself with \"delighting in the responsive and manifest spirit,\" as if utterly unaware of primordial qi’s truth—could this truly be called knowing the Dao?\n\nThose who speak directly of primordial qi affirm the One. This One is what the Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, Man) share in common, the foundation of life itself. There is substance, there is form—this is the original face of self and other, the root to which the ten thousand methods return. Returning to the source to recover life is but the One in its manifold expressions. Beginning with the One, all cycles of advance and retreat remain the One—how could it bear a second name? Hence the teaching of pointing to the One and returning to primordial qi.\n\nInheriting the master’s oral instructions, moved by the fivefold harmony of the western rhyme:\n\n*The Secret of Golden Fluid and Returned Elixir*:\nWithin the void, a child is nurtured.\nOnce the master’s touch awakens,\nThrice sigh the world’s unknowing.\nGuard and return—spirit comes home to me,\nJoined with Qian in daily use.\nMeet no one to ask of the Way,\nBut taste the single dose of the knife’s edge.\n\nForging the sword of pure Yang,\nGeng-metal’s hardness serves its purpose.\nYielding yet opposing mercury,\nUnbending must add lead.\nCrossing the sea, sinking or not,\nPassing the pass—profound, again profound.\nThe immortal fears no restraint,\nHanging his girdle, he ascends to heaven.\n\nDaoist lineages divide into pure and turbid,\nErroneous transmissions corrupt the principle.\nInquire of herbs: old or tender?\nFurnace and cauldron: Yin or Yang?\nDragon and tiger know their birthplace,\nHusband and wife easily lose heart.\nTwelve years to refine the cinnabar,\nThe great medicine weighs a catty of gold.\n\nAt chaos’ first division, the birth,\nHeaven and Earth’s qi began green.\nRejoice—not a minor path,\nYet pity those who revile its form.\nThe two luminaries revolve around the crucible,\nThe five sprouts house the ten thousand spirits.\nThe yearly elixir is named here,\nThe scriptures and secrets recorded in the *Huangting*.\n\nTo complete life, one needs the golden crucible,\nWithout spirit, there is still spirit.\nYi meets Geng at Xin’s port,\nNa Jia flirts with Xin.\nOuter medicine easily disorders nature,\nInner elixir rarely rescues poverty.\nFrom afar, I hear of Tang’s Lü,\nWho vowed to deliver a thousand souls.\n\n*The Valley Spirit* concludes its third scroll.",

      "translated_text": "**The Gushen Chapter**\n\n**Title:** *The Gushen Chapter*. Two fascicles. Originally attributed to Lin Yuan Shenfeng Mi of the Five Fortunes Mystic Nest, dating to the Yuan dynasty. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, Methods category.\n\n**Preface to the Gushen Chapter**\n\nThe ancient sage-kings who governed the world as public office first transmitted the Dao of immortals in silent succession. Those who governed the world as private inheritance did not pass on this Way. Thus, it ended with Yu, and afterward dispersed among recluses beyond the world, all transmitting it orally, without establishing written texts. By the Zhou dynasty, the Old Master set forth five thousand words—his language profoundly ancient, his meaning profoundly subtle. Who but a spirit or sage could fathom it? Liezi and Zhuang Zhou regarded it as emptiness and nothingness; Gai Gong and Cao Can saw it as purity and stillness. Though not the orthodox interpretation, they did not stray far from the Dao.\n\nYet among its misfortunes, there were three: First, the followers of Shen Buhai and Han Fei twisted it into cruelty and mercilessness, distorting it with the fallacies of penal laws. Second, Kou Qianzhi of the Northern Wei, having compiled Daoist scriptures, found them insufficient in number and thus merged them with techniques of prescriptions, talismanic water, alchemical elixirs, divination, and apocryphal texts, confounding them into one. Third, before the coming of the Buddhist Dharma, the teachings beyond the world were of two kinds: one called immortality, the other called the Daoist school. Immortality pertains to life, the yang; the Dao pertains to nature, the yin. Though the division of these two schools in the bibliographic treatises of various histories may not be entirely precise, their distinction is nonetheless clear.\n\nYet those of limited insight, constrained by their teachings, could not discern the difference. Foolishly taking the solitary yin within the body, they pointed to the heart and kidneys as Kan and Li, lead and mercury, engaging in the intercourse of the golden elixir. They deceived the foolish with their clamor, the blind leading the blind.\n\nAlas, how can one not sigh in lament!

      "translated_text": "Of late, I have encountered Master Lin of Xuáncháo, a hermit of the Three Mountains, and at a single word, our minds met as if needle to magnet—a once-in-a-millennium fortune for which I cannot but rejoice. The Master then presented me with his *Three Mysteries Treatise*. Reverently taking it in hand, I read with awe, my heart astounded and my eyes turned anew. I long to carve and disseminate it, that it may broadly benefit scholars, yet my coffers are ever empty, and the means to do so elusive. Thus, I earnestly beseech the renowned and the well-disposed to join in this noble endeavor, that its radiance may illuminate posterity—not without purpose.\n\nOf old, the Perfected Lord of Jǐngyáng foretold in his *Mysterious Record* that a thousand years hence, in the region of the Five Mounds, eight hundred earthbound immortals would emerge. Now, the time is nigh! This book shall awaken faith and insight in all who encounter it, awaiting the true transmission. Those who attain the Great Elixir of Dragon and Tiger shall ascend directly to the ranks of immortals, fulfilling the prophecy, and enter the gate of longevity and enduring vision—how could this not be the path of the great man?\n\nLet none among us abandon themselves. Written in the sixth month of summer, in the yǐ-mǎo year of the Yányán reign, by Zhào Sīxuán Cóngshàn of Zhàozhōu, at the Háo River in Línchuān.\n\nI have heard that through cultivating the Dao one attains immortality, through practicing Chan one becomes a Buddha, and through Confucian study one advances in office. These three pursuits are the great endeavors of extraordinary men, yet few achieve them. The Dao operates by principle, medicine by principle, and governance by principle. Without the character *lǐ* (principle), to what could the Dao cling to justify its name?\n\nMankind is born into this life, yet none can escape old age and death. Those who speak of cultivating the Dao speak of cultivating the body; those who speak of refining the elixir speak of refining the form. The wise may seek benefit thereby, while the foolish only invite harm. Why is this so?\n\nMan’s body is received from his parents, a single spark of primordial yang coalescing into the physical frame, growing into a six-foot form. The origin of this body is not a fabrication of willful imagination or something conjured from nothing. At the age of fifteen, one’s years resemble the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, the great abundance of lead and mercury complete within the crucible and cauldron. Beyond this point, gradual decline sets in. Moreover, with the tumult of emotions and desires, essence and qi inevitably wane and dissipate. Before middle age, many already show weariness in their faces and loss upon their heads—a lamentable sight indeed!\n\nThus, the immortals of antiquity clearly pointed to the two qi of life and body as the root of the medicine. The teaching urges one to infer and augment, to compare qi with lead to prolong life. There is no other meaning here—this is the principle of sealing the furnace and mending the altar. Such is the Way of loss and gain.\n\nYet there are foolish men, shallow in fortune, who know not the preciousness of their bodies or the value of their lives. They fail to preserve the original destiny of their innate celestial alignment, instead praying for longevity before wooden idols and clay effigies—thus do they remain ignorant of the Dao. In vain do they exert effort in anger, donning coarse garments and eating bark, enduring hunger and cold. Seeking the formless Dao, they exhaust their bodies in rigid sitting, clenching their fists to cultivate qi—yet gain nothing.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, some engage in debating empty doctrines, vying in verbal sparring, composing literary responses, and deeming such pursuits their life’s work. They merely strive to outwit others in conversation, yet even in old age remain utterly lost—all for lack of seeking true awakening. Worse still, they mutilate their forms and extinguish their natures, growing ever more deluded. They sit idly as the world’s clamor swirls around them, yet none can escape the consequences of their folly.\n\nSome arbitrarily fabricate perverse theories, claiming that since man possesses a body, all sensory dusts defile it, and thus all existence is illusory. Others spin endless discourses on life and death, asserting that since birth must end in extinction, seeking life is mere survival, and true bliss lies only in quiescent annihilation. They say that in death, the yin soul reveals one’s original face—neither born nor destroyed, neither increasing nor diminishing. Or they claim that the luminous spirit abides eternally in the void, yet where does it suddenly depart? Those who stitch together such hollow arguments later regret that the body is the root of suffering, yet cannot abandon it. Some burn their crowns, sever their arms, or mutilate their limbs; others cast themselves into water or fire, deluded into believing such acts are mere illusion.\n\nThere are those who sit passively awaiting old age to exhaust their allotted years, only to be mocked for their senility. How can they know that in death, the hun and po wander the gloomy paths, buffeted by wind and rain, suffering according to their karma? Have they not heard of those who perish in war? Though their forms are gone, their spirits still crave blood offerings to soothe their souls. Those who die of starvation, though their mouths are no more, still yearn for grains and cakes to ease their hunger. Those who perish naked, though their bodies are no more, still seek silks and coins to cover their shame. Those who drown, though their blessings are no more, still long for glutinous rice dumplings to honor their memory. Those who succumb to ulcers, though their backs are no more, still require straw effigies to bind their pain. Those who die in childbirth, though their blood is no more, still demand orchid basins to cleanse their filth. And what of those who hang themselves, drown unjustly, perish in prison, or die on the road? Their souls are seized and replaced, yet they cannot escape the bitter realms. Let the wise ponder this: where is the bliss in quiescent annihilation?\n\nMan possesses a body—while alive for a single day, he gains a day’s joy; delaying death by a year, he adds a year’s wisdom. With deep wisdom and far-reaching insight, he may commune with the divine. Thus the common saying goes: foxes that live long learn human speech; pythons that endure the ages summon wind and rain; sandalwood and cypress, with time, develop fragrance; clams and oysters, sealing their essence, nurture pearls. How much more, then, should man—the most numinous of beings—pursue the Dao to seek life? With the body as the pivot of the numinous, should he not refine his form to attain immortality?\n\nThe Dao is no esoteric mystery—it is found in daily speech and mundane affairs. Its principles are exquisitely subtle, its mechanisms attuned to movement and stillness. Yet it is often illustrated through familiar analogies, and without a sincere and earnest approach to learning, few can truly grasp it. Is this Dao something my noble peers may hear—or not? As the *Immortals’ Classic* states: \"The Way of fleeting laughter is not worth discussing with lesser minds. Only those of superior wisdom and strength can uphold it.\"\n\nI am a man of the Lin clan from Min’s homeland. In my youth, I suffered through warfare, family strife, and mutual betrayal, scattering my kin. I wished to pursue the scholarly path, but circumstances prevented it; I considered taking refuge in the Buddha’s gate, but feared leaving no legacy. Adrift like tumbleweed, I endured countless trials, knowing hardship and poverty, mastering humble tasks. Upon reading the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon*, I felt as though I had long understood its truths. Thus, I devoted my heart to the Dao, exhausting my body and squandering my years, wandering lakes and seas, enduring hunger, cold, and toil, accepting all things as they came.\n\nFortunately, I met a perfected one who took pity on me and instructed me in the essentials of cultivating truth—for preserving the body is the foremost art. I then pored over countless scriptures, consulted diverse teachings, and realized: to seek long life, one must return to one’s origin; to see the Tathāgata, one must investigate the fundamental. That origin is the primordial qi; the fundamental is essence and blood. Knowing the root, one’s efforts are not wasted—like the starving finding food, the sick receiving medicine. Awakening to the true and constant, one solidifies the path to the Dao.\n\nYet some cling to empty words and perverse views, claiming to accumulate karmic causes for future lives or cultivate blessings for the next, while treating their present body and mind as useless vessels. Without cultivation, there is no attainment—ultimately, all is emptiness. Examining the alchemical classics and texts on the Elixir, I see that the most crucial method lies in the divine water of the Flower Pool, the foundation of all elixirs and the ancestor of the Great Dao. Preserved, it is called the Precious Pearl; conjoined, it is called the Golden Elixir. Though a thousand schools share this principle, their verses and songs each express their intent. Through diligent practice, my words flow smoothly, and my speech resonates with the divine—though I am ashamed of my inadequacy.\n\nAs for the fire phases and the weights of the ingredients, these have already been expounded by past sages; I dare not add superfluous details. Reflecting on my shallow grasp of the supreme Dao, I hesitate to speak further. Yet fearing the waste of years, I plan to retreat to a secluded island, dwelling in mountain caves to make my final rest. Often I think of old friends scattered like stars across the Wu and Chu regions, at the ends of the earth—unable to bid them all farewell, I have no choice but to gather these crude words, like curdled milk, and send them to like-minded souls as a parting message.\n\nThus I compose this work, titling it *Valley Spirit*, for it concerns nothing more than nurturing the primordial qi. Though its language is coarse and its words unrefined, it preserves the workings of creation. If any discerning gentlemen chance upon it, may they read with understanding, silently resonating with its truths and subtly aligning with the Dao’s mysteries. Should they find passages awkward or poorly crafted, I would be grateful for their corrections.\n\nI received this transmission from a teacher, tracing back through the lineage of Han Xiaoyao, and am a disciple in the line of Master Lu’an Yu.",
      "overlap_context": "une, who know not the preciousness of their bodies or the value of their lives. They fail to preserve the original destiny of their innate celestial alignment, instead praying for longevity before wooden idols and clay effigies—thus do they remain ignorant of the Dao. In vain do they exert effort in anger, donning coarse garments and eating bark, enduring hunger and cold. Seeking the formless Dao, they exhaust their bodies in rigid sitting, clenching their fists to cultivate qi—yet gain nothing.",

      "translated_text": "The *Book of Changes* states: \"Qian is Heaven! Kun is Earth! Valleys are marshes! Things take form!\" Yet the *Daoist Classic* counters: \"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; valleys attain the One and become full; the myriad things attain the One and come to life.\" Man, too, is a thing—attaining the One, he lives; losing the One, he dies. Not a single day can pass without the One.\n\nThus we know: Heaven’s One, Earth’s One, the valley’s One—these three cycle endlessly, ascending and descending, mutually generating, alternating as end and beginning. Though things possess the One, they abandon it and thus cannot retain it.\n\nIn ancient times, Fuxi first drew the Eight Trigrams, beginning with a single line to form Qian, declaring it \"firm and unceasing,\" yet it must reach its end. He then added another line to pair with it, and thus two Qians became Kun. Some say he softened Qian’s hardness to create Kun, so that hardness and softness complemented each other, movement and stillness harmonized, and stability was achieved. Qian and Kun are the keys, giving rise to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the male and female of Qian and Kun. When Kan and Li transform below, they generate Dui and Gen, which are the male and female of Kan and Li. Male and female unite to become husband and wife; husband and wife conceive and become parents; parents age and become elders. Herein lies the principle of the Prior and Posterior Heavens, cycling endlessly in mutual generation.\n\nThose who cultivate the body rely on a single art or skill to sustain themselves; those who refine life embrace the One of yin and yang to preserve their spirit; those who govern a household return to one wife and one concubine to secure their home. All these are called \"attaining the One,\" and thus body and mind find stability.\n\nLaozi embraced the One to discourse on the Dao, his five thousand words distilling the essence of the Dao into wondrous efficacy, while virtue aligns with hidden yin. Of virtues easier to transmit, Yan Yuan did not stray from benevolence for three months—benevolence is righteousness, is virtue, and thus his virtue could be passed on. Of the Dao harder to transmit, the *Hong Fan* lists five blessings: the first is wealth—wealth is property, is fortune, and thus one may receive the Dao.\n\nBorn between Heaven and Earth, some uphold benevolence and perfect virtue, some guard wealth and achieve fortune—Heaven’s endowment is not equal. Wealth relies on divination to reveal its efficacy; righteousness listens to lawsuits to settle disputes. Yet the Dao does not value teachers, nor virtue rely on resources. How then can the pursuit of righteousness achieve completion, surpassing the study of wealth?\n\nThus rare treasures must be firmly grasped, while easily heard matters often fade away. Offering coins to sacrifice to the altars of soil and grain is no different from tribute; privately setting up shrines to conceal spirits is no different from accepting bribes. As the ancients said: \"The Dao is not idly transmitted, just as worldly sentiments drive alchemists to seek arts in vain.\" At their extreme, they hide certain texts or secretly imitate their forms. Those who seek masters and inquire of the Dao, yet go a lifetime without transmission—when no trace remains to guess, they blame only themselves; what cause for resentment?\n\nSome say: \"The Dao is not untransmitted, nor must it be transmitted through wealth. Even humble and esteemed gentlemen may scorn the Dao upon hearing it.\" The Dao branches into many schools, but lest this Way vanish from the world, if one finds a worthy recipient, the Dao burdens the person. Those who casually copy scriptures dare not append their words; those who falsely claim to possess gold cannot entrust them with their treasures.\n\nFormerly, officials hastened to attain the Dao, and many courtesans once achieved immortality. Thus they discerned favor and disgrace, understood skill and clumsiness, excelled in listening yet suddenly awakened, and though deceived, were not deluded.\n\nNow, worldly learning forgets the root to chase the branch, loses the Dao to cultivate virtue, regards ten thousand as the most noble of numbers, and the One as the basest. Hearing of non-being, they mock; hearing of being, they sneer. The Dao shelters under the One’s protection, while the One is the Dao’s taboo. Though many scholars clamor about embracing the One, guarding the One, uniting the One, attaining the One—mere names truly bear no weight, like seeing a square and not valuing the medicine.\n\nThus the One cannot be easily described in form or words. When words are insufficient, one chants and sings; when that is insufficient, one sighs in lament—still insufficient.\n\nTo study the Dao yet lose the One’s substance and function is like a thousand gold pieces easily obtained, yet a drop of water hard to dispel. The ancients who attained the Dao attained the One. Those who cultivated the great perfection of the supreme vehicle roamed the mysterious realm, entered the gate of all wonders, refined the Great Mystery’s One, and widely spread the celestial black writ, the primordial talismanic water, to save the dying world. Some say they \"took from excess to supplement deficiency\"; others say they \"harmonized mercury and lead, sparing both sides harm.\"\n\nOnly foolish men and women corrupt the Dao and disrupt truth, wantonly harming one another. Filial sons who lose the Dao cut their flesh to save their parents, only to cause both parent and child to perish! Do they not know the One cannot be sacrificed?\n\nThe scriptures say: \"The Dao has three thousand six hundred gates; attaining one, all matters are complete.\" Thus the One is the master key of the mysterious pass, the central lamp of the awakened instant—no lock remains unopened, no depth remains unilluminated.\n\nIn my middle years, I groped for the mystery with empty hands and awakened to the Dao, painfully reflecting on the many hardships of piercing through. Fortunate to have gained it from the four directions, not through mere effort but through no loss, I record this for universal salvation.\n\n*Quatrains on Fire Timing and Practice*\n\nLong life has a secret, yet no work is done,\nWaiting for impermanence, feet tread on emptiness.\nTelling of mercury and lead, they only laugh—\nHow can they recognize the master’s breath?\n\nGold essence and wood liquid lie east and west apart,\nDrawn back and moved into the earthen crucible.\nWhen the five phases return to the One’s nature,\nWho can match the alchemical work of elixir refinement?\n\nThe numinous sprout grows the root of the Dao,\nWhen the flower blooms, the moon becomes full.\nThis is the true black descending from the five directions,\nCalled true mercury, also named lead.\n\nWithin the sun is the crow, yin gold red;\nWithin the moon is the hare, yang fire white.\nWhen crow essence and hare blood merge into the elixir,\nOrdinary mercury and lead cannot be refined.",

practice.\n\nWu maidens and Yue beauties are sought in abundance,\nBut who understands the *Spring and Autumn*’s warning of patricide?\nWhen the navel’s gate suddenly opens, the bronze Buddha laughs—\nAll the relics in the bag vanish in an instant.\n\nBedchamber arts, if known, are better left unknown;\nWidows and chaste wives often outlive their husbands.\nBanish the ghost that clings to

the temples, red hangs from the crown.\nLeisurely gazing into the mirror,\nOne finds one’s appearance no longer ordinary.\n\nThe river chariot’s conveyance of qi is inexhaustible—\nA single revolution equals nine years of work.\nTo embrace the Dao and sustain the body leaves no trace;\nLearners vainly crave swift success.\n\nThe sun, moon, and stars move in their ordered course—\nDiscern the subtle

      "translated_text": "**Five Blessings: The Mysterious Nest**\n*By Lin Yuan, the Divine Phoenix*\n\n**The Art of the Pitch-Pot, Illustrated**\nA golden vase casts wooden arrows—\nQi’s cavity draws the spirit home.\nWith heart upright and form aligned,\nThe mechanism nurtures and unfolds its power.\n\nLu Lüzi said: *\"To honor Buddhism is to depart from office and guard the abiding; to study the Dao is to seek the mysterious in the Water Palace.\"*\nThis saying is most apt!\n\n**The Diagram of Embracing Primal Simplicity**\n*On the Empty Fame of Stillness Practice*\n\nIn cultivating the Dao, there are five stages, each a step toward immortality. Let us examine them:\n\nTo refine destiny (*ming*), one must preserve perception and presence, taking the body as the elixir chamber, qi as lead and mercury. Following the movements of yang’s work, supplemented by medicinal tonics, one cures illness and is called a *Human Immortal*.\n\nFurther, by safeguarding the spirit with the Jade Token and embracing a weighty, pure, and unadulterated nature, one grasps the image while forgetting words, achieving longevity in the world—this is an *Earth Immortal*.\n\nWithdrawing behind walls to sever worldly ties, concealing one’s traces to evade summons, and refining the form with Golden Fluid until both form and spirit attain subtlety—this is a *Divine Immortal*.\n\nMastering the pivot of creation’s mechanism, aligning with Heaven’s Dao, enduring great trials, observing the mysterious precepts and prohibitions, forgetting speech and action while broadly cultivating benevolence, silently accumulating merit—one awaits the fulfillment of qi and the perfection of spirit. Then, transcending into a body of pure, light, harmonious qi, one returns to the Grotto-Heavens, attaining the rank of *Heavenly Immortal*.\n\nThese four ranks, though distinct in grade, follow the gradual progression of destiny-refinement. Thus, their principles yield inevitable fruition.\n\nAs for refining one’s nature (*xing*), one must trust in the void, taking qi as the master and the body as a temporary abode. Embracing yin qi to guard stillness, one unites the myriad threads, stills the hundred thoughts. Though eating and drinking do not burden the heart, the Four Great Elements remain inert, the Five Viscera idle. Through prolonged seated practice, the body becomes free of chronic illness, and toil goes unnoticed.\n\nWith diligent effort, one gradually attains stillness and stability. When essence (*jing*) ceases to leak, both nature-water and spirit become limpid. Inwardly observing, the heart is absent; outwardly observing, form vanishes; gazing afar, things dissolve. One enters true stillness.\n\nYang’s *hun* gradually wanes, yin’s *po* gradually prevails. The essence of *po* and the water of nature both grow luminous. In stillness, one forgets—this is called *entering samādhi*. Only then does one sense the body within light; in vagueness, the body disappears. Nature expands freely—this is called *attaining nature*.\n\nWith a pure and expansive heart, the center is empty yet responsive. Profoundly, one foresees the fortunes and misfortunes of human affairs, discerns past and future, yet remains unaware of one’s own afflictions. Some, in yin’s collapse, grow fearful, dreading the legions of demons. Exertion dulls wisdom; in dullness, serpents and tigers appear before them.\n\nWithout cause, yin spirits attach to their nature, perverse influences enter their bodies, ghosts and spirits rush to serve them—yet they merely endure the labor. The verification of stillness practice, compared to embracing the One, is also said: *\"If one can remain constantly clear and still, Heaven and Earth all return to them.\"*\n\nWhen yin essence flourishes, corpse-demons flourish. Unaware, one plunges into deep abysses—yet all can emerge of their own accord. As the saying goes: *\"The Dao rises a foot, the demon rises ten.\"*\n\nSome abandon the body to tread peril, indulge in empty thoughts to forget hunger and cold, or with fierce qi eat without excreting. Forgetting form, they feel no pain; in corpse-like trance, they harm themselves without injury. Facing execution, they remain unscathed; in suspended breath, smoke fails to dry them. When nature perishes, they wholly forsake sleep.\n\nAll such \"benefits\" arise from clinging to life and shunning death, free of fear—yet they only astonish and delude. Far from the Dao, they are but fleeting illusions, ultimately inescapable from death.\n\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme and suddenly stirs—not by host or guest, but by thieving perversity—movement becomes uncontrollable. Essence scatters, and one speaks in verses, displays teachings, manifests forms to transform the vulgar, or abandons being for emptiness. Some slander the true wind—this is the loss of the heart, where the desire to prevail lingers, not the Dao’s doing. Though called \"attaining the Dao,\" in truth, nothing is attained.\n\nBorn between Heaven and Earth, one holds the eternal golden celestial drop of spirit-water, the embryo complete with both male and female. Thus, when nature stabilizes, water clarifies; when clear, it reflects things. A pool’s water, when limpid, breeds fish and turtles; a mountain with springs harbors spirits—when contained, it breeds demons.\n\nThe vulgar hear of sorcery: entering a home, one gazes into the water in a bowl to perform theft—how much more so with the yin talisman of nature-water! For the cultivator who enters the realm of empty samādhi, if endowed with innate spiritual bones and an unwavering heart, they may awaken to the turning light and returning illumination, restoring life to its root. Sealing the mouth to sacrifice to the turtle, closing the eyes to cross the bridge—some can transfer the spirit upward, exit the corpse and re-enter the shell, coming and going without obstruction. Truly attaining the Dao of *Ghost Immortals*, realizing the fruit of the *Empty King*—one in ten thousand achieves this, a rare feat.\n\nYet though called \"accomplished,\" can one feed hunger with porridge made of no rice? If, swayed by external things, heterodoxies arise, and one mistakes the demon’s chatter for one’s own ability—alas! The calamity of loss is near. Who would say one dies without resentment?\n\nAlas! How lamentable!\n\nHeaven’s Dao constantly cherishes all things, leaving none abandoned. Ghosts and spirits have no fixed disposition; when the Dao declines, they are lost. Some say the ghostly path is easy—how much more so for disaster?\n\nConsider the Ghost Immortal’s attainment: unable to roam the light and pure, nor retain form in the heavy and dense, they dwell in the dim and distant, their thoughts alone—what is it like? Observing Heaven and Earth’s myriad things: first yin, then yang; from nothing to being; first emptiness, then fullness; abandoning delusion to seek truth; first ghosts, then spirits; laying down arms to cultivate culture; first merit, then skill; from coarse to refined.\n\nAll things, once existent, gradually decay, collapse, disperse, and perish, returning to formlessness.",

Agitation overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat; weakness overcomes strength; thought overcomes fear.\n\nHeaven’s Dao: yin ever prevails over yang. Human Dao: stillness ever prevails over motion. Humans are endowed with excessive yin substance, hence the three *hun* and seven *po*.\n\nThe path of immortality often begins auspiciously; the ghostly path often begins inauspiciously. The *Yijing*’s transformations likewise state: one aligns with ghosts and spirits in fortune and misfortune. Yet in worldly affairs and literary principles, a hundred things are empty for every one that is real.\n\nTo abide in motion is also the Dao—when motion reaches its extreme, stillness emerges, and in stillness, spirit congeals. To abide in stillness is also the Dao—when stillness reaches its extreme, motion returns, and in motion, qi scatters.\n\nObserve the hen brooding her eggs: when water is poured over them, those that float and stir hold life; those that sink and remain still hold none. No life means no spirit—this is a principle as clear as day.\n\nThe sage, observing the cycle, laments the ruin of things, sighing: “Better there were no things at all, so one would not witness their decay.”\n\nDivination texts state: Heaven and Earth, years, months, days, and hours each have their moments of emptiness—how much more so for humans? Ordinary people’s deaths and burials last no more than three years. But for physicians, shamans, diviners, sages, loyal ministers, and righteous scholars who establish merit, benefit the world, and leave behind a name—those whose virtuous deeds extend their grace to later generations—are praised by the people. Thus, their names endure in the spirit realm, and their sacrifices are offered. Though loyal, serene, righteous, and brave, their spirits manifest in the yin realm.\n\nOthers, who merely admire lofty purity or reckless simplicity and have temples named after them, possess only empty reputations. In office, they share the same emoluments; in death, they share the same vulgar fate. Though they may have temples, they receive no offerings. Their deaths return to impermanence—no different from those who, in solitary yin, cling to stillness.\n\n---\n\n**Water Tune Prelude**\n\nThunder lies buried in the earth,\nSprings well forth beneath the mountain’s base.\nThe pivot’s mechanism aligns—\nOnly the noble man can fathom its workings.\n\nThe first nine: “The hidden dragon—do not act.”\nThe top nine: “The exalted dragon has regrets.”\nThe dark ford gathers in the Yellow Palace.\nGreat Accumulation brings advantage—\nExcellently succeeding, nurturing the primal male.\n\nDismantling the primordial chaos,\nSeeking the cauldron’s essence,\nCrafting the *Cantong Qi*.\nWith sincerity filling the jar,\nThe Dao flows abundantly, vast and bountiful.\n\nRepaying intoxication with golden grains from the valley,\nEmbracing decay in a cracked urn,\nRetiring to dine in public service.\nReceiving restraint through doors and windows,\nIts Dao endures without end.\n\n---\n\nAwakening to the celestial immortal’s secret,\nPenetrating the patriarch’s barrier.\nInverting *kan* and *li*,\nReturning to the root and reviving destiny—\nA matter of moments.\n\nNeither fasting nor precepts,\nNeither action nor silence,\nNor seated meditation in perfection.\nWhy then do fellow disciples\nForgo sleep and forget meals?\n\nSeek the yellow sprout,\nCapture one’s own mercury,\nBind the returning elixir.\nWorldly affairs are burdensome,\nYet none touch the Dao.\n\nNeither abandon wife nor chase concubines,\nNeither cast off children nor forsake office.\nSimply drink the Great Mystery’s wine—\nEach one may ride the phoenix.\n\n---\n\nThe great medicine, the golden elixir’s ancestor,\nExists before the division of mixed essence.\nHard and soft split apart—\nDifferent names, yet both emerge from mercury and lead.\n\nGrasping the Dao’s reversal of things,\nRefining this divine water of the Flowery Pond,\nExtending the pattern to unite with the mystery.\nThe double eight is the crucial juncture—\nHusband and wife reunite.\n\nNoon arrives at *shen*,\n*Yin* rises at *zi*,\nCirculating the celestial orbit.\nThe hexagrams align in *Jiji*—\nYin must await yang’s extremity to assume power.\n\nThree and five: *geng* gives birth, *jia* reaches fullness.\nGradually, *Zhongfu* conceives—\nIn ten months, the sacred embryo is complete.\nInside and out, radiant and crimson,\nThe great creation corresponds to pure *qian*.\n\n---\n\nForm and appearance nurture the *Kundulun*,\nFully attaining the *Pratyekabuddha*.\nThe great thousandfold world of self and others—\nAll named the immeasurable *asamkhya*.\n\nMen dwell in Jetavana’s almshouse,\nWomen in the Sea of Awakening’s gate—\nLove and desire are the roots of suffering.\nIf one delights in the *Lana* path,\nThe reward of blessings still exceeds the term.\n\n---\n\nCharity like Sudhana’s,\nTreasure like Prabhūta’s,\nBroadly seeking teachers through karmic excellence.\nSuddenly transcending the other shore,\nScooping from Cao Creek.\n\nThe Buddha spoke of the *Srotāpanna* fruit,\nI attained the *Arhat* path—\nThus realizing bodhi.\nThe first *pāramitā*:\nListen carefully and contemplate.\n\n---\n\nTrees, though old, may be grafted;\nCan humans, though old, be left to wither?\nThe Mysterious Origin feeds on the mother—\nThe returning elixir entering the mouth is the true plan.\n\nBegging the western neighbor’s red brew,\nSeeking the eastern neighbor’s white wine—\nTwo into one gourd.\nBoiled in my cauldron,\nThe jade hare and golden crow dance.\n\nRescuing decline,\nReviving the old woman,\nRestoring youth like a fledgling.\nEssence fills the marrow,\nBody and mind ever robust.\n\nCommon sayings claim immortals renounce desire,\nIdly speak of true persons having no thoughts—\nEven heaven’s husband is moved by mechanisms.\nI say: this is no ordinary Dao,\nIt does not bind itself in solitude.\n\n---\n\nCreation’s game is fleeting and false,\nHeaven’s net spreads wide as mugwort.\nLifting the veil of life and death—\nThe hinge’s turn reveals King Yama’s presence.\n\nThe six paths’ wheel devours and consumes,\nA single qi’s circulation governs high and low.\nExamining the orifices to bestow life—\nOnly then may one avoid being cast into the skin’s hub,\nYet even then, meeting good parents is rare.\n\nFriends are many, but those who listen are few.\nDeception and entanglement arise from haste.\nHeaven and hell—\nBelieve in Shen and Lü,\nInvestigate Han’s constancy.\n\nPlowing hunger, few regrets,\nThe Dao’s valley doubts and lacks—\nYet actions skillfully align.\nTo escape yin and yang’s construction,\nRefine lead frost in the golden crucible.\n\n---\n\n**Diagram of Wood and Metal’s Separation in Function**\n**Diagram of Primordial Qi’s Generation**\n**Discourse on Primordial Qi**",

      "translated_text": "At the inception of primordial qi, it is but a single millet grain, a dewdrop, a water bead. From the boundless kalpas of beginningless time, within the obscuring haze of coalescing dust, it harbors and congeals a single droplet of water’s essence. Nurtured within, like a basket bearing an egg, it germinates from the base—thus it comes to be! Forcibly named the Dao, the Numinous Treasure, born of yin yet sustaining it, white within and black without, its dark essence establishes the martial, the warp of the Northern Dipper. Thus, the inner white transforms the po-soul, paradoxically belonging to yin; the outer black alters the hun-soul, paradoxically belonging to yang—this is yin’s containment and yang’s embrace.\n\nThe inner yin, stirred by yang’s movement, follows and emerges, becoming misty vapors. The outer yang, awaiting yin’s stillness, steps inward, initiating the swirling of nascent qi. As yin first emerges, it is unseen—termed \"elusive and indistinct,\" akin to cold mist rising. As yang first enters, it is unheard—termed \"profound and obscure,\" suddenly like the formless, generating warmth. Once conjoined, they blend in undifferentiated substance, accumulating from small to great, neither pure yin within nor pure yang without.\n\nMoreover, yin qi as disposition favors expansion, leisurely dispersion, desiring full emergence. Yet as it gradually emerges, it does not forsake its offspring, forming embryonic radiance—appearing like mist generating dampness. Yang qi as nature favors nurturance, harmonious fusion, desiring full inwardness. Yet as it gradually enters, it cannot depart its mother, forming portents of dawn—warmth flickering in union and separation, generating heat. The outer yin increasingly coalesces; the inner yang increasingly congeals, binding into chaos. Its form returns to the origin, establishing celestial patterns—this is the dark enveloping the yellow.\n\nNow, the dark pertains to water, the utmost essence of primordial qi, accumulating to fullness. The yellow pertains to fire, the generative spirit of residual qi, blazing within its bounds. Thus, within this chaos, only a single gleam of sunlight sinks into the water! Yin qi lies beyond the heavens, thus unable to rest, ever fluttering like a mother soothing a sleeping child. Yang qi resides within the fluid, thus unable to move, ever stirring like a chick awaiting the hen’s nourishment. Through prolonged nurturance, dryness arises within the yellow. Once dryness is born, the dark essence erodes and desiccates; water dries and qi empties—from this emptiness, wind is born. When dryness reaches its extreme within, thunder resounds!\n\nThus, within the heavens’ womb, the Four Symbols reside. Within, wind strives to rise yet cannot stir; water strives to flow yet cannot; fire strives to flame yet cannot ascend; thunder strives to surge yet cannot erupt. Gradually, they clash and contend, even to the point of war. Wind aids water’s force, creating surging waves; thunder aids fire’s force, adding vehemence. Until, through fierce collision, it shatters! Shattering is division—this is the opening of heaven. Thus, thunder quakes and resounds; wind lifts the vast expanse; fire’s qi ascends and descends; water’s fluid flows and pours. The ancients who governed transformation secretly designated wind and thunder as Pan Gu’s names, that later generations might not lightly fathom creation’s workings.\n\nOnce heaven divides, primordial qi transforms. The lighter qi ascends from below, congealing into the celestial abode. The heavy residue of primordial qi’s accumulated fluid follows the base it bears—this is true water. Tracing back to the time since heaven first took form, until chaos had not yet shattered, its vastness spanned but a hundred li. Generally, a person today may traverse a hundred li in a day—thus thunder resides within it. Only by firmly nurturing the sound of a hundred li can one shake the fury of ten li, for fire is its mother. Fire’s conflagration in a day does not exceed a hundred li before subsiding—thus we know thunder and fire’s command are constrained. Water may flow ten thousand li in a day, and wind likewise—thus we know water and wind’s governance are unbounded! Therefore, thunder’s strike scorches objects; wind’s breath dampens garments—each bears the imprint of its mother qi’s endowment.\n\nOnce the hundred-li heaven divides, it becomes a thousand li, gradually extending to ten thousand li. Wind expands according to direction; thunder surges according to position. The outer residual qi spreads and arranges; the inner primordial qi’s portents circulate and enclose. Through kalpas of response and transformation, it becomes impossible to fathom its myriad li! Some ask: wind and thunder share the same cavern—why can wind blow ten thousand li while thunder only shakes a hundred? It is said: wind, stirred by cold qi, blows water—this is primordial qi’s surplus, called yin qi, malign qi, perverse qi, easy to accumulate yet hard to disperse. The yin spirit governs the world with frequent recklessness. Thunder, borrowing dryness to shake fire, is residual qi’s selflessness, called yang qi, wrathful qi, righteous qi, hard to arouse yet easy to calm. The yang spirit governs the world with constant fidelity. Thus, when thunder unfolds, its sound weakens; when it surges, its fury abates.\n\nWater, fire, wind, and thunder are the Four Symbols. Wind is but spirit; thunder is but resonance; fire is but light; water alone possesses substance. The sun is but fire’s light. Within the celestial vault, only water possesses the potential to manifest substance. Water’s upward correspondence gives rise to the Northern Asterism, and thereafter, water’s qi, the sun’s reflection, through transformation, generates the moon. Yet water is the mother of both prior and posterior heaven.\n\nWater begets wind; wind in turn stirs water, raising waves into foam. Thunder shakes water, churning it into floating duckweed. The sun bakes water, congealing sediment into brine. The moon illuminates water, settling the chamber into mud. Mud accumulates and gives birth; worms and insects transform together—thus earth is formed.",

      "translated_text": "Wind scatters and stirs dust; the sun scorches and hardens sand. When heavy dew descends and water nourishes the earth, moss and lichen first arise. Then come creeping weeds, followed by tender shoots, their fleeting growth and decay gradually thickening the soil. Grasses transform into bamboo, branches flourish into trees; over time, grasses bear ears, trees grow trunks, and herbs yield fruit. Spring’s flourishing and autumn’s shedding all rot and return to the earth, which grows ever richer until the land takes shape.\n\nAs tree roots intertwine with earth and piled soil solidifies, over time they harden into stone. Thus, within the bounds of heaven and earth, all that possesses form and image reduces to but two things: wood and stone. Ancient trees, infused with the qi of heaven, earth, clouds, and mist, develop essence and sap; over time, they transform into birds and dragons, into demons and men. Endowed with spirit and vitality, when shaped by karmic conditions, the limbs, hair, and body of humankind derive from wood—thus enabling leaping, drumming, grasping, bending, and stretching, all expressions of its nature. Red stone, nurtured by water and earth, refined by the sun and moon, develops blood and milk; over time, it transforms into toads and tigers, into sheep and women. With mechanisms transparent and fluid, when driven by thunder, the skull, abdomen, and bones of the human body derive from stone—thus enabling sitting, crouching, dwelling, and embracing stillness, all expressions of its essence. Wood as male and stone as female, once united, conceive and bear sons and daughters, completing the human form.\n\nWith the emergence of humankind, transformation and nurturance diverge. Even without mating, insects and creatures arise from wombs and embryos; young and old depend on one another, preserving offspring. Species differentiate, and myriad forms take shape. Those that forage in the wilds and fields develop natures suited to flight and movement; those that gather near hearths and settlements gain wit and discernment, beauty and ugliness. Tracing the origin of men and women born of wood and stone reveals the shift from insentience to sentience. The moist nature of stone gives humans their molars; the withering nature of wood brings death. All living forms are partial and contingent, yet the human body is most refined, endowed with the fullness of yin and yang’s primordial qi.\n\nHeavenly spirits and earthly deities are all governed by humankind. It is further said: Since the opening of heaven and earth, their form resembles an overturned vessel. Within it, primordial qi generates and transforms; various qi ascend, congealing and accumulating at the vessel’s rim, forming the vaulted expanse like soot settled at the bottom of a cauldron. Depending on the thickness of the ascending qi below, over time it hangs suspended, forming layers and masses. Nurtured by the qi of the sun, moon, cold, and heat, it is smelted and refined into ore, its core harboring the essence of metals and jade. When defiled by turbid qi, it falls as hills, mounds, and caves. Nüwa’s smelting of stone to mend the heavens drew upon its primordial qi, leaving its raw substance in the world—these are the five metals and treasures. Those yet unrefined remain as cinnabar, lead, alum, saltpeter, and the like.\n\nAs the vaulted expanse accumulates qi over time, the weight of its raw substance gradually sinks. Above it, the hollow emptiness of Kongtong arises. All things, day and night, exhale qi that ascends, borne aloft by the blazing tips of these vapors. The scorching, shadowless qi penetrates the empty expanse, condensing into the sun’s spirit. The liquid qi of all things mingles below, forming the numinous essence of stars and sun. The qi of transformation manifests as lesser stars, hence called \"lodgings,\" for they retain light for a single night. Observing the Dao of heaven, one sees that in its beginning, it possessed no numen—it contained the reflections of all images, its inner radiance serving as its spirit. It had no deity; the blazing brilliance of the qi enveloping all things became its god. Without external form or inner shadow, even the sagest cannot behold its face, though the worthy may align their hearts with it.\n\nSome say the destruction of heaven and earth arises from no other cause: the excessive generation of the two qi weakens water’s power and hollows the earth. Primordial qi is water; residual qi is earth. Water flows day and night, scouring rivers and marshes, so river sources shift their courses and riverbanks lack fixed shores. Thus, the topography of Yu’s era reflects the prosperity and decline of north and south; the sands of Qiantang respond to the gathering and dispersal of east and west. As days pass and months return, the world follows the transformation of ridges and valleys. When water’s flow reaches its limit, its force weakens. Moreover, the earth’s overabundant generation of life hollows the soil, rendering it unable to sustain itself. Minor collapses occur in low-lying areas; major ones cause total subsidence. When strength is exhausted and destiny fulfilled, even in collapse, there is a bottom. Yet the light of the sun and moon, scattered by the shock of collapse, vanishes.\n\nWhen the earth first subsides, life’s qi ceases and cold qi prevails. Heaven, left unsupported, becomes perilous. Within its darkness, all beings perish, returning to earth without residue. Three hundred and sixty years pass in the human world. When yin’s stillness reaches its extreme, yang stirs again; cold qi transforms into warmth, and warmth and cold interact, generating dampness. Once damp qi arises, it steams and spreads in all directions. The vaulted expanse, vast and desolate, becomes drenched and sodden, its vastness dissolving and collapsing. Another three hundred and sixty years pass, as it endures dampness and crumbles.\n\nExamining the structure of hills and ridges—layers of stone beneath layers of soil, piled and interwoven—reveals that the decay and destruction of heaven and earth have long existed. The rest and renewal of heaven and earth are the cessation of creation’s force to nurture qi, the Dao of yin and yang’s union, the principle of returning to the root and restoring life. Though called destruction, it is merely the generation of residual qi, accumulating to form a posterior heaven above and a hollow earth below, where substance settles and returns to soil. The prior heaven, however, knows no destruction, for its primordial qi endures, returning to regenerate. When damp qi flourishes and heat’s signs appear, extreme heat gives way to dryness, and yang qi arrives!",

Though dark passes and earthen barriers lie within, they reside in its inner realms of brightness and obscurity, stillness and movement. The circulation of its primordial qi, along with its rest, occurs solely within it—thus it endures. Heaven envelops the myriad things, stealing their qi to nourish itself, and by this means attains long life.\n\nNow, heaven’s theft of the qi of things: there is no second heaven—it steals only from what is born within itself. Thus, the myriad things suffer no loss or violation; this is the natural theft it rightfully claims. Humans, too, can do this. Moreover, since humans share the same body, if they can steal from what they themselves possess, how much more can they steal from other things!\n\nYet in the human body, beyond the five viscera and six bowels, nothing else abides. Though every sip and bite enters from without, to seek long life solely from self-generation is difficult. Thus, the Yellow Emperor practiced the art of controlling women and lived to one thousand two hundred years. Qian Keng mastered the method of nurturing infants and enjoyed a lifespan of eight hundred. Looking back: grafting peach onto apricot, grafting mulberry onto elm; consuming the velvet of deer, eating the flesh of young animals; wearing furs, demanding bloody sustenance—all because their qi can supplement qi, their essence can stir essence. Though things differ, their primordial qi is the same.\n\nThe ancient sages said: draw near from the self, draw far from things. The world recites these words, yet few truly savor their meaning. In cultivating the Dao, one seeks attainment—through seeking attainment, it is called \"theft.\" Eating grain is theft; eating meat is theft. To become a thief who feeds the spirit, though theft it may be, no theft compares. If one can steal primordial qi from oneself and return it, then the realm of long life is easily attained! How then could one plot further, becoming a thief of unkindness?\n\nFurthermore, what is the primordial qi of humans? In its beginning, it is a single dewdrop of life within the qi of the beginningless. It gives birth to heaven, gives birth to earth, and through wood and stone, gives birth to humans. Extending to ancestors, it is the parents who give life to the body. What now resides within the human body is the single point of spirit-qi between the two kidneys—bestowed by the parents.\n\nNow, the union of yin and yang in heaven and earth, the coupling of the myriad things: it is the coupling of essence. Misrepresented, it is said to be blood. Once parents infuse their spirit into the Gate of Origin and the Cavern of Nurturing Yang, it is the root of the beginningless mystery, the original dewdrop—this is called primordial qi. Its form is indistinct, its image obscure, concealed within the essence-fluid—this is the water-body.\n\nIt governs the kidneys, containing and nurturing the yang soul, transforming to generate heart-qi. Heart-qi generates the pupils of the two eyes, dividing into clear and turbid. The clear qi of the right eye transforms into spirit-water, returning to the heart as fluid. The heart’s fluid transforms into blood, returning to the left kidney as essence. Essence transforms into qi, guarding the spirit as nature.\n\nThe turbid qi of the left eye ascends to generate brain marrow, forming the skull. Once complete, it descends to generate the spine, then the right kidney, pairing with the left kidney as the Gate of Life—or in women, the uterine palace—uniting hun and po souls. The hun generates the liver, heart, tongue, gallbladder, pericardium, small intestine, bladder, and penis. The po generates the lungs, throat, stomach, spleen, colon, large intestine, anus, and the constructive and defensive qi, combining to form the Triple Burner.\n\nThe hun governs the movement of blood and constructs the sinews, ligaments, and channels. The po transforms qi to move the defensive, generating flesh, bones, hair, and skin, completing the body, and thereafter the four limbs. In women, all is reversed, for they face north to receive the embryo. (This pertains to the mother’s pulse diagnosis.) Yet though male and female differ, both rely on the cubit pulse to determine life and death, equally decisive for fate.\n\nThe operation of primordial qi: it resides in the kidneys, passes through the heart, responds in the eyes—three palaces ascending and descending, a single qi circulating. Thus, the kidneys pair with the bladder, the heart with the small intestine, the eyes with the brain. These pairings are their gathering places. Knowing these pairings—this union, this return—one understands the qi’s egress and ingress: its intervals, its waxing and waning, its clarity and turbidity. This is the sign of illuminating the heart and perceiving nature.\n\nThe transformations of primordial qi divide into two forms: qi and fluid. Qi is called life; spirit is true mercury. Following movement and external contact, when awake, the spirit roams in the eyes; when eyes close, it returns to the heart; in sleep, it retreats to the kidneys; in silence, it gathers at the brows—this is the ascent and descent of qi.\n\nFluid is called nature; essence is true lead. In tranquil cultivation and internal return: in the kidneys, it is essence; reaching the liver, it becomes hun; reaching the heart, it becomes blood; reaching the spleen, it becomes rich marrow; reaching the pericardium, it becomes constructive vessels; reaching the lungs, it becomes po; reaching the Triple Burner, it becomes defensive qi; reaching the interstices, it becomes moving qi; reaching the brain, it becomes spirit-spring; descending to the nose, it becomes jade nectar; reaching the throat and tongue, it becomes numinous fluid. Entering the stomach, it gathers in the heart’s domain.\n\nThe constructive and defensive qi, once circulating the body, return to the heart, joining with the fluids of grain in the large intestine. At the colon, they separate the clear and turbid: the clear qi enters the small intestine, seeps through the kidneys to the bladder. The bladder returns to the original sea, the original sea regenerates qi—endless day and night.\n\nAt this moment, it is called the spirit returning to qi, qi reuniting with fluid. The noble person guards their solitude, attaining this as the minor return. When male and female dwell together in the chamber, one thing divides into two names: within yin lies hidden yang, called the Yellow Sprout; within yang lies the image of yin, named the White Snow Divine Talisman. Together, they are called the Knife-Point Elixir.",

After their collapse, heaven rises higher and grows more distant; earth sinks lower and thickens; mountains accumulate and tower ever more loftily, like stones revealed as waters recede.\n\nIf heaven and earth did not rest, there would be no means for them to unfold; if an infant did not sleep, there would be no way for it to grow and transform.",

      "translated_text": "The method of cultivation: at the *zi* hour of yang within the human body, nourish with extraordinary water and advance with natural fire—\"natural\" here means following the proper timing. In but a moment’s effort, something arises from nothing, forming the sacred embryo. This is called \"seizing the workings of creation.\"\n\nIf one does not seek the oral instructions and further loses the company of those of the same kind, even the Jade Fluid will be absent—how then could the Golden Fluid exist? Merely abiding in contemplation and non-action, hoping for the union that forms the elixir, is truly delusion.\n\nWhen a person lacks root and foundation, the body lies in partial decay. Qi cannot linger, fluids have no place to return. As the years advance, qi ages, the form withers, fluids dry up. Failing to complete the Dao, illness becomes their worry, hunger and thirst their burden, old age and death their sorrow—how much more so when seized by the killing mechanisms of yin and yang?\n\nSomeone asks: What is meant by \"seizing\"?\n\nWhen it is the time of cold and heat, they harm the blood and vessels, weakening the spleen and stomach. When it is the time of thunder and lightning, they snatch the hun and po, startling the spirit from the body. When it is the time of yin rain, they extinguish the spirit’s vitality, causing dreams of swallowing yin qi. When it is the time of frost and snow, they pare away the flesh, inducing dreams of peril and seminal loss. When it is the time of famine, they wither the qi and constitution, dulling the senses and breeding foulness. When it is the time of pestilence, they rot the life, bringing maggots, blood, and premature death. When it is the time of war and weapons, they destroy the form and will, bringing great pain and separation.\n\nUnaware, people lose their rosy complexions to unseen withering—all these are the seizing of the killing mechanisms.\n\nSome say Heaven loves life and hates killing—could Heaven not be compassionate? Yet Heaven’s love of life is rooted in earthly qi: it nurtures the living qi of beings and corrupts their dead qi, just as the human abdomen cannot tolerate putrefaction.\n\nIf one can regulate and ingest original qi, it must rely on stomach qi as its foundation. Forsaking the coarse and rough, one offers the refined and pure; rejecting untimely foods, one partakes of the fresh. Casting off the stale and spoiled, one takes in the sweet and nourishing, filling the stomach qi so that original qi overflows.\n\nConfucius said: \"When sacrificing for the lord, do not keep the meat overnight.\" When a traveler slaughters a sheep, he must first sharpen the blade and stab. Some say to eat living flesh and discard dead blood—what was once hearsay is now proven true. This is cherishing the body and valuing life, knowing what harms and what benefits, and thus drawing near to the Dao.\n\nIf one mourns in houses of misfortune or illness, enters places of childbirth or taboo corpses, hears the lamentations of prisoners or sits in slaughterhouses awash with blood, or even binds oneself in unlawful fetters, all these scatter the spirit in terror.\n\nLittle do they know that original qi lodges in the human body like mist in the grass. Even the most careful guardian has no master for a hundred years. Nurture it, and it remains; disturb it, and it scatters. Scattered, it causes dizziness; severely so, one collapses.\n\nThose who courageously nurture original qi possess bodies and minds of penetrating clarity, hearts filled with solid sincerity. They have thoughts and compassion, resolve and fortitude. Even when tasting great bitterness, severing an arm, or cutting off a foot, their original qi hides in concealment, their countenance unchanged—suddenly, they die. Or in a single joy or anger, they perish. Yet if they live, their spirit remains undispersed. Those who cannot nurture it are vulgar, shallow, and ignorant, clinging to delusions and retreating from insight. Full of taboos and easily deceived, their qi has no steadfast abode, their spirit no silent dwelling. Some, through sorrow or rage, even take their own lives—how utterly foolish!\n\nNow, the essentials of original qi: that which is guarded within is called *upright qi*, *Grain Spirit*, *nature and life*. The remaining qi that responds externally is called *vast qi*, *responsive spirit*, *voice and appearance*.\n\nThus, the *Wang Shuhe Pulse Classic* states: \"If the responsive spirit moves, the hun and po rest within, and the life-giving pulse does not cease—this is the movement of the responsive spirit’s point. As long as the life pulse remains, one does not die.\"\n\nTherefore, Laozi said: \"Nature and life are ever-present.\" The Buddha said: \"Voice and appearance are all empty.\" The one speaks of the internal, the other of the external.\n\nYet deluded followers, failing to fathom profound principles, mistakenly point to the Buddha’s teachings, seeking the bliss of extinction. How could they know the words from the *Analects*: \"When the bird is about to die, its song is mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are kind\"—how lamentable! Alas!",

When it came to exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, the very point where true work begins, they merely floated in vague talk of the constant Dao, refusing to take responsibility.
