  "full_translation": "**The Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture of the Peacock Radiant King, Spoken by the August Mother of the Jade Emperor, the Queen of Precious Moonlight**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture of the Peacock Radiant King, Spoken by the August Mother of the Jade Emperor, the Queen of Precious Moonlight*\n*Compiler unknown; collated and printed by Zhang Guoxiang of the Ming Dynasty. Three fascicles.*\n\n**Source of Base Text:** *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*\n\n---\n\n**The Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture of the Peacock Radiant King, Spoken by the August Mother of the Jade Emperor, the Queen of Precious Moonlight, Fascicle One**\n\nThe Dao speaks: At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy resided in the Heaven of Great Purity, within the Palace of Pure Tenuity in the Land of Floating Radiance, upon the Jeweled Terrace of Jade Nets, emanating nine-colored auspicious lights. Upon a nine-petaled lotus throne, phoenixes sang and simurghs cried, lions and white cranes encircled, while the Thunder Generals of the Four Directions and all the heavens gathered round.\n\nFormerly, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the fourth year of the Dragon Han era, the Earth Officials convened to deliberate the methods of the Southern Numinous Nether Calculations and the texts for delivering and rescuing beings. Before the Dao, the assembly expounded: the Great Emperor Ancestor of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder, the Great Emperor of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Spirits, the Four Brahmā Heavenly Kings, the Five Elders and Six Masters with the Four Sages, the True Lords of the Five Sacred Mountains, the Sage Emperors of the Five Marchmounts, the Source Kings of the Four Watercourses, the True Lords of the Five Celestial Granaries, the Eleven Great Luminaries, the Four Pillars of Destiny, the Four Directions’ Winding Deliverances, the Three Realms and Four Offices, the Heavenly Capital and Earthly Prisons, the Water Realms and Yang Ministries, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Three Officials and Great Emperors, the Four Ranks of Fire Officials, the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors, the Three Origins and Three Hundred Sixty-Five Degrees, the City Gods and Village Altars, the Plague Bureaus of the Judiciary, the Five Lakes and Four Seas of the world, the Nine Rivers and Eight Waters, the Twelve River Sources, the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, the Three Hundred Sixty Famous Mountains, the Eighteen Prisons of the Earthly Offices, the Twenty-Four Prisons of Fengdu, the Thirty-Six Prisons of Lady Qing, the Central Universal Torment, the Eighty-Four Thousand Layers of Ghostly Dungeons, the Great and Lesser Iron Enclosures, the Mountains of Swords and Lakes of Blood, the Gorges of Stone and Avīci Hell, the Ten Kings of the Nether Offices, the Two Hundred Twenty-Six Heavenly Kings, the Seventy Rakṣasī Women, the Twelve Jade Maidens of Incense Attendance, the Twenty-One Dragon Maidens, the Sixty-Four Māyā Women, the One Hundred Thirty Dragon Kings—each and all arrived to assemble. Bowing their heads in reverence, they paid homage, arrayed themselves in order, and stood in ranks to hear the proclamation of the scripture’s meaning.\n\nSuddenly, a Heavenly Mother arrived, riding a peacock. In the Buddhist teachings, she is the Peacock Tathāgata; in the Dao, she is the August Mother of the Jade Emperor, the Queen of Precious Moonlight. She gathered all the great benevolent deities of the Peacock Scripture to come and attend the Dharma-sound, take refuge in the Great Dao, and once more expound the numinous text of the Peacock’s virtue and power. She wished that within the Dao, she might resolve the calamities and hardships of all beings in the world.\n\nAt that time, the Peacock Radiant King circled thrice before the Heavenly Worthy and addressed him, saying: “We, the women of the two gates, today are fortunate to hear and behold your compassionate countenance expounding the scripture and Dharma. We beseech your deliverance and salvation. Whatever the ten entanglements, the karmic debts of three lifetimes, chronic illnesses and prolonged misfortunes, demonic specters and malevolent spirits, rebellious stars and constellations, curses and hexes, or all manner of disasters and misfortunes that afflict men and women in the world—if they but sincerely and reverently invite the good Dao, establish the scripture and Dharma in their homes, and perform the rites, all shall be dissolved. If their qi has not yet departed, they shall be spared from crossing over. Once the grievances of their karmic foes are resolved, they shall recover within three days. With pure body and mind, and fresh garments, they shall open the gates and announce to all the spirit shrines, specially summoning the soul and hastening the fate of so-and-so. They shall petition the Thunder Generals, receiving the talismanic commands of the Jade Purity and the august decrees of the Jade Emperor. Earnestly inviting Orthodox Unity Daoists—or three, five, or seven Daoist adepts—whether at home or in a Daoist abbey, they shall request the recitation of scriptures and repentances, light lamps, and perform the ritual circumambulation. Following the liturgical protocols in devotion, none shall fail to receive response. These are the wondrous words of the Heavenly Sovereign; all above shall act accordingly.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy proclaimed the commands to the Thunder Lords of the Five Directions, the Thunder Kings of the Five Directions, the Cloud and Thunder Envoys of the Eight Directions, the Marshal Generals of the Thunder Department, and the Investigative Envoys of the Nine Heavens. Each issued orders and decrees, bowed their heads in reverence, took refuge, and pledged to obey.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy spoke *The Scripture of the Peacock Radiant King, Spoken by the August Mother of the Jade Emperor, the Queen of Precious Moonlight*.\n\nThis scripture, in truth, is the marrow of the Great Cavern Scriptures, the transformative work within the scriptures, the application within the scriptures. For this reason, it was widely transmitted to the world below. Those who receive this Dharma-sound bow their heads to listen to the Dao.\n\nThen, the great assembly again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “From of old, the Primordial Worthy bestowed it upon the August Mother of Precious Moonlight; the August Mother bestowed it upon the August Earth Queen, the Earthly Thearch; the Earthly Thearch bestowed it upon the Three Officials, Four Sages, and Five Elders of the Lofty Perfected; the Five Elders bestowed it upon the Five Masters; the Heavenly Master in turn bestowed it upon the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Great Compassionate and Great Ultimate Universal Assembly, the Azure Net Savior from Suffering and Universal Savior Perfected One, Lord Xu. It was transmitted down through the generations. At one time, the Perfected of Fixed Radiance propagated the wondrous canon, proclaimed the teachings and Dharma, and universally saved all men and women in the world. Should calamities arise, with sincere heart they may burn incense, present memorials and petitions, recite scriptures and perform repentances, submit sincerity and pledge devotion, offer fresh fruits of the season, invite the Dao and welcome the Perfected. With earnest devotion, they shall recite *The Venerable Scripture of the Peacock Great Radiant King*, and reverently pray. In a basin of water, they shall burn the petition for resolving calamities, dispatching it to the Controller of Destinies, sweeping away demonic influences, and receiving the response of blessings. There is none that shall not be spiritually efficacious. To save a single life in the world is to accumulate ten kinds of merit. Together, they shall amass hidden merit and jointly realize the non-action.”\n\nThis is the arcane and wondrous liturgy, the secret transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas. If there are men and women in the world who, with sincere intent, proclaim and recite it to save beings, their fortune and longevity shall be boundless.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke a gāthā, saying:\n\n*All voices chant in succession...*\n\nThe Sovereign of the Golden Portal and Mystic Vault,\nThe Most High Jade Emperor Supreme.\nHis wondrous form crowns all heavens,\nHis compassionate radiance illumines the Three Realms.\nTrue Sage, Marvelous Dao, Merciful One,\nTeacher upon whom gods and humans rely.\nThe Great Vehicle bestows the Dharma-word,\nThe Orthodox Unity points the lost to the Way.\nHis merit vast as empty space,\nPraise of him knows no end.\nAll voices chant in unison.\n\nThereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy again addressed the hosts of heaven and earth, the Five Elders and Three Officials, the Four Sages and Ten Thousand Spirits, the Divine Mothers of the Perfected, and the sacred multitudes of Heavenly Mothers. According to the ritual, he transmitted the Five Directions’ Mandates, the True Writs and Divine Mantras, and the names of the Heavenly Kings, each to be recited in joint praise. May they ever grant protection, dispel calamity, and prolong life. May they propagate the Marvelous Dao and expound the numinous texts.\n\nRecite.\n\nThis Jade Emperor’s Mandate is bestowed upon the Nine Qi Heavenly Kings of the East, commanding them to lead the Azure Emperor of their direction, the august and exalted Perfected Immortals and sacred hosts, to descend to the scripture altar and guard the Eastern Quarter. They shall patrol the evil destinies, deliver and protect all beings, and specially grant so-and-so prolonged fortune, dispelled calamity, and augmented longevity. For me, they shall provide protection and witness the merit of scripture recitation. May life span reach a hundred years, peace and joy extend with blessings. May calamity be dispelled, life prolonged, and great auspiciousness descend.\n\nRecite one verse of the Golden Four Lines:\n\nGreat Heavenly King of the Nine Qi of the East,\nGreat Heavenly King of the Azure Heaven of the First Sovereign,\nGreat Heavenly King of Verdant Radiance Layered,\nGreat Heavenly King of the Elder Within,\nGreat Heavenly King Who Oversees the Charts and Registers,\nGreat Heavenly King Who Gathers Qi and Raises Immortals,\nGreat Heavenly King Who Assists the Liver as Year-Star,\nGreat Heavenly King of Cloud Radiance Layered,\nGreat Heavenly King of Horn Wood Jiao,\nGreat Heavenly King of Neck Metal Long,\nGreat Heavenly King of Root Earth Ge,\nGreat Heavenly King of Chamber Sun Rabbit,\nGreat Heavenly King of Heart Moon Fox,\nGreat Heavenly King of Tail Fire Tiger,\nGreat Heavenly King of the Four Seasons’ Revolutions,\nGreat Heavenly King Who Governs the Seven Stars of Winnowing Basket,\nGreat Heavenly King of the True Dipper’s Bright Wheel,\nGreat Heavenly King Who Receives Qi and Captures Wrong,\nGreat Heavenly King Who Sweeps Away Inauspiciousness,\nGreat Heavenly King of the Eastern Mountain’s Divine Mantra,\nGreat Heavenly King Who Summons the Nine Heavens,\nGreat Heavenly King of the Red Writ’s Mandate,\nGreat Heavenly King Who Restrains and Assembles Fengdu Mountain,\nGreat Heavenly King Who Sends Demons and Ghosts,\nGreat Heavenly King Whose Executions Are Unerring,\nGreat Heavenly King Who All Proceed to the Wooden Palace,\nGreat Heavenly King Who Arrests and Delays,\nGreat Heavenly King Who Governs the Eastern River,\nGreat Heavenly King of the Qi Sea’s Water Spirit,\nGreat Heavenly King of the Great Kalpa’s Flood Disaster,\nGreat Heavenly King Whose Body Is Borne by Flood Dragons,\nGreat Heavenly King Who Opens the Water Palace’s Path,\nGreat Heavenly King of a Hundred Thousand Passages,\nGreat Heavenly King of the Celestial Red Writ,\nGreat Heavenly King of Wind and Fire Unheard,\nGreat Heavenly King of the Golden Wheel’s Blazing Glory,\nGreat Heavenly King of Rooftop Moon Swallow,\nGreat Heavenly King of Star Sun Horse,\nGreat Heavenly King of Spread Moon Deer,\nGreat Heavenly King of Wing Fire Snake,\nGreat Heavenly King of Chariot Water Worm,\nGreat Heavenly King of Willow Earth Spread.\n\nInvoke and invite the forty-two Heavenly Kings of the East to ever grant protection.

Radiant King, the gateway of the Supreme Orthodox Unity, the primordial unity of the Nine Heavens’ inception—mysterious beyond mystery. The Most High Lord of the Dao broadly opens the gate of expedient means; the Dao possesses myriad subtle thresholds. Those who refuse to take refuge inevitably invite peril and misfortune. All fear death and devise countless schemes: some seek heterodox paths, slaughtering living beings; they shake bells to offer sustenance, ransoming souls and bargaining for life. Only when recovery remains incomplete do they finally take refuge—practicing the profound teachings of the scriptures, praising the Dipper and kindling lamps, performing rites of repentance and submitting memorials, reciting with sincere devotion. Within the Peacock Radiant Mother’s sutra reside the ten thousand spirits of the Four Palaces. Through single-minded devotion and cultivation, one may attain its response. Whatever is sought in teaching and transformation shall be granted, and gratitude for blessings received shall be duly offered.\n\nShould any seek to enter this Daoist gate, first let them cultivate impartiality, free from stray thoughts. Arrange their ranks and temper their sharpness, then proceed to the Threefold Purity: first, purify the body from contention; second, purify the speech from contention; third, purify the mind. Further, eliminate the three karmic actions and six sensory roots—thus may one follow the laws of the Three Caverns. For aeons without end, they shall dwell in heaven, ever receiving the Five Fortunes, guarded by the hundred spirits.\n\nWhen encountering the Three Primes, Five Offerings, four seasons, or eight solar terms—on one’s natal day or birth hour—within a purified chamber, burn incense and sit in silent meditation. Face the long-stemmed candle, bow deeply, and click the teeth. Recite this scripture, and longevity shall be attained. To preserve life and transcend calamity, the Middle Way Incantation for Prolonging Life and Longevity is spoken:\n\n*Recite, and the earth transforms into blossoms.*\n*The profound True Unity embodies the scripture, unfolding the texts of the Nine Heavens.*\n*Soaring through the hosts of Tai Luo, the golden terrace’s courtier approaches the Sovereign.*\n*Beyond suffering’s root, years endure like the sacred tree.*\n*The hundred limbs radiate as jade flowers; devoutly I thank the White Prime Lord.*\n*The Golden Terrace’s youths inscribe the cloud-mountain gate of true preservation.*\n*Virtue and fortune renew with each day; the body’s light illumines the Three Heavens.*\n*Purple canopies veil a thousand palaces; the heart takes refuge in the Supreme Honored One.*\n*The Five Fortunes ever flow; the adept of the Mysterious is secretly shielded.*\n*Demons are driven beyond the Eastern Sea, bearing the Great Radiance of the Void Emperor.*\n*No refuge remains in the world—save the gates of hell.*\n*Eternally free from ghostly karmic grubs, those who hear not the wondrous Dharma scriptures*\n*How may they attain liberation? The Prime Lord commands the ghosts:*\n*Suffer them not to harass living beings. Should they disobey my teaching,*\n*Their heads shall shatter into seven fragments, never to know pardon.*\n*For ten thousand kalpas, they shall not transcend rebirth. But those who take refuge in the Dao*\n*Shall ascend to heaven, exhausting its blessings.*\n*After five kalpas of cyclic transformation, good men and good women*\n*Together shall receive a thousand springs of fortune.*\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and decrees.*\n*All [omitted character].*\n\nThe Dao speaks: All that is uttered at the conclusion of this scripture emanates from the myriad Celestial Emperors of Heaven. All kings and lands, all divine kings of heaven, and the divine healers of illness—all rejoice in boundless, everlasting fortune, attaining peace and bliss. Longevity flourishes, the teachings spread far and wide, and celestial blossoms scatter in profusion.\n\nAt that time, the great assembly, having heard this scripture, was filled with immense joy.

Venerable again addressed the attendant perfected ones on his left and right, saying: \"Now I expound the *Venerable Peacock Sutra*, which responds to all without fail. This sutra is exalted and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. For you and all others, I expound the causes of eliminating transgressions and extinguishing sins in the hells.\"\n\nThen the Savior-from-Suffering Celestial Venerable arrived and assembled in great compassion, dissolving all karmic offenses in the hells for sentient beings and rescuing those sunk in suffering. If there are beings who broadly cultivate good causes and make various offerings, they may first deliver their nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages, ascending to heaven, transforming into human rebirth, and only then can they save others from calamities. Liberated from suffering and ascending, they broadly establish merit, opening vast fields of blessings.\n\nSummoning the eight divisions of devas and dragons, the ten generations of earth deities, the Four Brahma Heavenly Kings, the asura celestial kings, King Yama, the officials of Mount Tai—Minister of Destiny, Recorder, Merit Officer, Executioner—the Five Paths Great Spirits, the lords of hell, the underworld officials and scribes, the bureaucrats, clerks, and ghostly soldiers of the Northern Darkness Fengdu, all reverently prostrate, bow their heads, and address the Celestial Venerable, saying: \"The karmic retributions endured by sentient beings in the world are all governed by the great demonic obstructions of sin. In the Jambudvīpa realm, those who commit the ten evils and five rebellions, who are unfilial to parents, who break fasts and violate precepts, who slaughter and cook sheep, cattle, horses, the six livestock, flying birds, and running beasts—after death, they all enter the nine dark hells. Day and night they suffer without release. Without broadly cultivating merit, establishing fasts, and making offerings, even if they accumulate merit through torture and confinement in dark prisons, none will ascend to heaven.\"\n\nThen the Celestial Venerable, day and night contemplating sentient beings, said: \"You should heed my words. When any sinful person dies, or when men, women, parents, or kin pass away in the world, you should establish a Daoist altar, perform rituals, scatter flowers, and broadly offer resources. Conduct repentance fasts, and the underworld will measure their deeds. Those with merit will have their transgressions dissolved by blessings; those without merit will endure karmic retribution. Ten thousand taels of gold cannot be taken with you. Only a few scrolls of true scripture, unbound and unrestrained, can be relied upon. Though gold is precious, it cannot secure your future. Those who recite this sutra will all attain liberation. Though this sutra is subtle, it can save the living and the dead.\"\n\nThen all prostrated and bowed, entreating the Celestial Venerable to expound and leave behind the names of the Ten Courts of Hell and their officials, broadly making them known. He then proclaimed the sacred titles:\n\n*Begin the \"Plucking Tea Leaves Song.\"*\nInvoke the First Court of Hell: Supreme Wondrous Vast Perfected Lord.\n*Venerable Peacock Bright King Sutra*, dissolve disasters, extend life, and preserve peace.\n\nInvoke the Second Court of Hell: Yin Virtue Settled Joy Perfected Lord.\n*Venerable Peacock Bright King Sutra*, dissolve disasters, extend life, and preserve peace.\n\nInvoke the Third Court of Hell: Cavern Illuminating Universal Stillness Perfected Lord.\n*Venerable Peacock Bright King Sutra*, dissolve disasters, extend life, and preserve peace.\n\nInvoke the Fourth Court of Hell: Mysterious Virtue Five Spirits Perfected Lord.\n*Venerable Peacock Bright King Sutra*, dissolve disasters, extend life, and preserve peace.\n\nInvoke the Fifth Court of Hell: Most Victorious Radiant Spirit Perfected Lord.\n*Venerable Peacock Bright King Sutra*, dissolve disasters, extend life, and preserve peace.\n\nInvoke the Sixth Court of Hell: Treasure Constellation Shining Completion Perfected Lord.\n*Venerable Peacock Bright King Sutra*, dissolve disasters, extend life, and preserve peace.\n\nInvoke the Seventh Court of Hell: Equal Contemplation Illuminating Principle Perfected Lord.\n*Venerable Peacock Bright King Sutra*, dissolve disasters, extend life, and preserve peace.\n\nInvoke the Eighth Court of Hell: Supreme Right Liberation Perfected Lord.\n*Venerable Peacock Bright King Sutra*, dissolve disasters, extend life, and preserve peace.\n\nInvoke the Ninth Court of Hell: Flying Demons Expounding Celebration Perfected Lord.\n*Venerable Peacock Bright King Sutra*, dissolve disasters, extend life, and preserve peace.\n\nInvoke the Tenth Court of Hell: Five Transformations Majestic Spirit Perfected Lord.\n*Venerable Peacock Bright King Sutra*, dissolve disasters, extend life, and preserve peace.\n*All* [respond].\n\nAugust Emperor of Eastern Peak Mount Tai, Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Sage Great Thearch.\nAugust Emperor of Northern Darkness Fengdu, Authority of the Scales.\nOfficials of the eighteen layers of hell.\nRulers of the twenty-four prisons of Fengdu.\nAssistant Ministers of the Three Offices of Hell.\nGrand Preceptor of the Four Twilight Offices of Hell.\nOx-Head and Horse-Face Hell Guards and Divine Kings.\nInnumerable Great Power Demon Kings of Hell.\nOfficials who measure sin and merit in hell.\nAll underworld clerks, lords, and masters of the dark yin.\n\nAll [respond].\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Venerable, for the sake of all those in the underworld subjected to interrogation and torture, and for the people who, after death, sink into hell—when the Dark Bureau’s virtuous assemblies govern their deliverance, the hells become naturally unobstructed and empty. Their transgressions are extinguished, and they do not pass through hell. Suffering and bitterness are entirely without hindrance.\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable issued a decree, commanding the Left Bureau’s Yang Officials and the Right Bureau’s Yin Officials to weigh merits and virtues. The interrogating officials of Fengdu’s twenty-four prisons released all suffering ghosts and wandering souls, who then ascended the Fire-Refining Pool. Each assumed a transformed body, holding the cinnabar talismans of the numinous realm to protect their rebirth. Once more, they emerged into the world, attaining human existence. They took refuge in the Daoist and Buddhist teachings, revered the Three Treasures, and served their lords with loyalty and filial piety. They gained carefree freedom, abiding with the Dao in perpetuity.\n\nThus, the Heavenly Venerable universally delivered all sentient beings and suffering sinners, enabling their transcendence. All you sentient beings, listen carefully. I shall now proclaim for you the incantation for extinguishing sins and ascending as immortals:\n\n*\"Fengdu’s night stands firm,\nsuddenly radiant light shines.\nIlluminating the hidden souls,\nthey ride the fragrant porridge’s steam.\nNuminous talismans refine in fire,\na hundred bones take flight.\nWitnessing the Dharma assembly,\nimmortal maidens know the way home.\"*\n\nAnother verse is recited:\n\n*\"A chance in ten thousand kalpas,\nthe immortal affinity is revered.\nOpening the hidden path’s secrets,\nall relies on the true wind.\nBoundless salvation and grace,\nthought by thought, karma arises.\nRiding the light through the sky,\nthe deceased are delivered.\nNine generations ascend to heaven,\nthree lineages escape suffering.\nSeven ancestors rise,\ndisciples and all kin.\nThe household thrives in peace,\nprayers answered by the divine.\nForm and origin are reborn,\nfood and drink reveal their savor.\nDisasters dissolve, calamities avert,\nlifespan extends.\nThe whole family shines in glory,\nkinfolk live in harmony.\nProtected and at peace,\nthe stars move in accord.\nFortune and emolument grow,\nfive virtues bring celestial blessings.\nThe four luminaries rise in splendor,\nGreat Yin and Great Yang.\nVictory and felicity flourish,\nthe twenty-eight constellations.\nLong blessings dispel misfortune,\nmalevolent stars retreat.\nFortune and longevity shine in glory—\nhasten to report to Mysterious Heaven!\nAvert calamity and distress,\nboth the living and dead benefit.\nMisfortune departs, fortune arrives.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees!\"*\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable addressed the Most High Lord Lao: \"The sentient beings of the Three Realms drift in the sea of suffering, without liberation. How can you bear this? You must diligently uphold the secret instructions to universally deliver them all.\"\n\nThe Most High diligently upholds the decreed mandate, daring not conceal any truth. If there are sentient beings afflicted by calamity, distress, or illness, they should recite this scripture, invoking the sacred names of the Peacock Radiant King, the Holy Mother Heavenly Venerable, the Heavenly Kings, Dragon Kings, Jade Maidens, Rakṣasas, Dragon Maidens, and Māyā and their hosts. Together, they should entreat the Great Compassionate, Great Merciful, Great Benevolent Perfected Ones, and the Perfected Ones Who Save from Suffering. Thereupon, they shall depart from suffering and attain lasting liberation, forever freed from entanglements, gaining longevity and extended life. Their lifespan shall be prolonged, and all calamities and hardships shall be extinguished.\n\nAt that time, the Most High Dao Lord spoke in verse:\nThe Two Perfected Ones of Great Compassion\nCan save the suffering of the Three Realms.\nThey radiate light to illuminate the world,\nCausing hells to cease and desist.\nBlade mountains stand towering,\nCauldrons of boiling oil blaze fiercely.\nWith sincere hearts, invoke the Perfected Ones—\nSinful souls shall be freed from imprisonment and grievance.\nIllness and manifold suffering,\nCalamities beyond description,\nWounding the viscera and the five spirits,\nMove the Perfected Ones to pity and sorrow.\nDevout faithful men and women,\nReturning to the Dao, must set their hearts sincerely.\nEver mindful of the host of divine beings,\nThey shall depart from suffering and escape sinking sorrow.\nSwiftly dispel grave afflictions,\nEvil demons dare not encroach.\nDay and night, let the heart not stray—\nLiberation shall wholly preserve your body.\nWith courage and resolve, dedicate the merit,\nTogether returning to the Forest of Seven Treasures.\nThus do I take refuge,\nWith wholehearted reverence.\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One Yin Xi respectfully addressed the throne, saying: \"Now, in the lower realms, among sentient beings—men and women—whose three lifetimes of karmic debts and ten great sins may be dissolved and dispersed, some may be renewed, their fortune and longevity increased. Through great compassion and great mercy, they may be spared from entanglements and harm.\"\n\nTheir misfortunes shall befall their descendants,\nExtending to nine generations of ancestors.\nLong sunk in eternal night,\nThey universally hope for pardon and liberation.\nMen and women, cycling through human form,\nNever severing the root—ever dwelling in the human realm.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"This scripture is the sacred utterance of the Three Heavens, the words of all Perfected and Sages. Thus, among the beings of the lower worlds, if there are men or women within great nations who commit many evil deeds—disrespecting Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the king, the land and waters, their parents who gave them life; cursing wind and rain, engaging in all manner of wicked causes—\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and honest,\nTheir hearts upright, their natures gentle.\nThey bore no envy or malice,\nCultivated good thoughts,\nAnd widely practiced kindness.\nThus they attained long life,\nAll dwelling in peace.\n\nNow, in the latter age, people speak falsely of luck,\nTheir hearts cunning and deceitful.\nThey cultivate no good conduct,\nOnly amassing cruelty.\nThey do not honor the Great Dao,\nBut rely on perverse spirits.\nThey perform spells and curses,\nDeliberately harming lives.\"\n\nAt that moment, the Perfected One bowed twice and addressed the throne:\nThe Dao spoke: \"With compassion, I think of the living,\nSunken and lost as lower ghosts,\nTheir souls tormented and seized,\nTheir hun and po without refuge.\nI wish for a method of liberation,\nThat all beings may be spared unjust suffering.\"\n\nThe Dao said: \"Listen carefully to what I now proclaim.\nI have also observed the people of the middle age,\nWho specialized in dark sorcery.\nThey would go to the shrines of perverse demons in heaven and earth,\nWhere punishment and harm occur.\nRecording names and birth signs,\nThey secretly uttered vows,\nSprinkled water,\nTrampled with their feet,\nGlaring with bulging eyes and gaping mouths,\nAssuming all manner of postures.\nUtterly devoid of Dao-mind,\nThey wantonly harmed the good.\nWhether they acted themselves,\nOr instructed others to do so;\nWhether they suffered themselves,\nOr caused others to suffer in return.\"\n\n\"If there are virtuous men or women who have been afflicted by the curses or dark sorcery of evil persons, they should bathe in fragrant waters and establish a Daoist ritual arena. They must invite the Dao and welcome the perfected, prostrating before the Dao’s image. To the Great Compassionate Perfected Ones, the Peacock Radiant Kings, and all the hosts of perfected sages—devote your hearts to reciting this *Sutra of the Venerable Mother Peacock Radiant King*. The merit of this sutra is beyond conception. This sutra can dissolve the Iron Enclosure. This sutra can rescue those afflicted by illness. This sutra can distance one from evil persons. This sutra can dispel all malevolent demons. This sutra can dissolve curses and wicked karma. This sutra can repel all perverse paths. This sutra can avert all disasters of water and fire. This sutra can shatter the great hells. This sutra can protect the land and all weapons of war. This sutra can eradicate locusts and safeguard the virtuous. The virtues of this sutra are inexpressible, beyond full description. Wherever this sutra resides, the Five Emperors of the Five Directions, each leading a million soldiers, stand guard. Wherever this sutra is with its disciples, in the four directions, the eight quarters, above and below, and the central realm, all inauspicious omens are severed. Dark sorcery and wooden specters are universally dispelled.\n\nNow the incantation for dark sorcery and gu poison is proclaimed:\n\nThe great Dharma stands majestic,\nHeaven is round, earth is square.\nHeaven has nine pillars,\nEarth has nine beams.\nThose who cast curses or sorcery\nBring calamity upon themselves.\nSix pillars and three beams—\nDark sorcery and gu perish.\nThree beams and six pillars—\nThey return to their originator.\nSix Jia and six Yi—\nDark sorcery and gu lose their way.\nSix Bing and six Ding—\nDark sorcery and gu take no form.\nSix Wu and six Ji—\nDark sorcery and gu do not arise.\nSix Geng and six Xin—\nDark sorcery and gu are unreal.\nSix Ren and six Gui—\nDark sorcery and gu fall into slumber.\nCurses swiftly dissolve,\nGrudges and karma flee afar.\nWhoever dares defy this decree\nShall be seized and sent to the Thunder Prison,\nTheir hearts carved out, lungs torn,\nTheir bodies rent and bloodied.\nThose who follow my incantation\nShall attain long life.\nHasten, hasten, as the law commands!\"\n\n\"Invoking the Three-Five Generals, the Envoys of the Eight Winds, the Community Decrees of the Nine Provinces, with ten thousand generals and warriors, a hundred thousand myriad hosts, to pursue and seize dark sorcery and gu. The Envoys of the Five Tones shall capture and bring forth those who cast dark sorcery and gu. The three hun and seven po shall all be bound in the forbidden prison, never to depart. Those who utter curses upon the wicked—let their essence and spirit scatter, their minds and wills run wild. Their heads shall bear a mountain of fire, fiercely ablaze. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall suffer without respite, day or night.\n\nShould they instead follow the teachings of the Peacock Radiant King Sutra, their bonds shall be loosened and dispersed, and their wronged spirits shall ascend to heaven. The exorcism of grievances and curses, the methods of dark sorcery and demonic forces—I now proclaim. If any good man or woman hears this sutra, great expedient means shall unfold. They shall heal the afflicted, deliver sentient beings, secure peace for their lives, and strengthen their bodies. Their fortune and longevity shall extend, free from all calamities and obstacles. Creditors and adversaries shall swiftly depart and dissolve. Gu poisons shall be released, the Three Corpses expelled, and the Dao attained, becoming perfected.\n\nThen the Most High Lord Lao declared this incantation:\n*I once wandered the Middle Kingdom,\nAscended to the Supreme Heaven.\nNow I come to the Middle Kingdom,\nTo teach and transform all beings.\nNinety-six kinds there are,\nEach with its own karmic ties.\nThose who revere and believe,\nShall transmit it in turn.\nWith unwavering diligence,\nThey shall ascend to the Supreme Heaven.\nWhere this sutra is recited,\nThat person’s lifespan shall extend.\nA hundred spirits come to guard,\nTen thousand illnesses all healed.\nIn this life, joy shall be theirs,\nTheir bodies firm as gold and stone.\nThe supreme and perfect Dao,\nDissolves misfortune, blessings arise.\nIf they follow my teachings,\nDemons below shall turn to dust.\nThus by this scripture’s power,\nEnemies shall scatter of themselves.\nThose who uphold the true Way\nShall attain long life,\nForever at peace.\nHasten, hasten, as the law commands!*\"\n\nThe assembly of the faithful, with sincere devotion and focused minds, extol and recite the demon-quelling sacred incantation:\n\n\"As wished, as wished—Chumeng, Chumeng.\nHeaven’s wheel turns, Heaven’s wheel turns—Falín, Falín.\nJuecen, Juecen—Fáduō, Fáduō.\nAsuras auspicious, Asuras auspicious.\nTurning, turning auspicious—accomplished, accomplished auspicious.\nAscending, ascending auspicious—Bayuan, Bayuan.\nChoubo, Choubo—Danliu, Danliu.\nBearing Heaven, bearing Heaven—shouldering stone, shouldering stone.\nJiongkai, Jiongkai—Tuoluo, Tuoluo.\nMoho, Moho—Yuansu Daoli Wang.\nJianchou Huoluo Spirit, Liemu Duhuang Wang.\nWestern Heaven Gualuo Spirit, Longyuan Zhutuo Wang.\nJiangtai Duoluo Spirit, Jiangyin Hebo Wang.\nMountain marsh and abyssal pool spirits, Ninefold Qi Heavenly Demons.\nTen Heavenly Emperors, Supreme Subtlety’s Five Spirits.\nFour Watercourses and river sources, Radiant King Heavenly Worthy.\nHasten, hasten, as the law commands!\nPure River leads the way.\"\n\nAt that time, the Most High Lord Lao, since the Primordial Beginning first expounded the scriptures, had instructed the host of immortals and sages to deliver and save all beings, thereby securing peace and tranquility. Calamities were averted, blessings stored; pine trees dispelled malevolent ghosts. Curses were dissolved, inauspicious omens scattered and destroyed. Auspicious signs arrived in abundance, upholding the sagely Dao and ensuring the transmission of scriptural teachings.\n\nThen, the great assembly rejoiced and leapt with joy, their reverence unbounded. They vowed to receive and uphold the teachings, bowing their heads in homage and taking refuge, then withdrew with respectful farewells.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThe Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s *Scripture of the Venerable Peacock Radiant King, Sacred Mother and August Empress of Precious Moonlight* concludes within this fascicle.\n\n**The Three Refuges**\nWe take refuge in

cause,\nWith sincere hearts we recite the name of the Great Heavenly Worthy, the Peacock Radiant King.\nAll respond: Inconceivable merit and virtue.\n\n**Fascicle the Lower of the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s *Scripture of the Venerable Peacock Radiant King, Sacred Mother and August Empress of Precious Moonlight***\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was in the Heaven of Floating Blackness, radiating great light.\nHe expounded the supreme, most true, and wondrous Dharma,\nUnfolding the numinous script of the Peacock.\nAgain, he summoned the Three Realms and Four Bureaus,\nThe Five Marchmounts and Four Streams,\nThe Five Lakes and Four Seas,\nThe Nine Rivers and Eight Waters,\nThe Twelve River Sources,\nThe named mountains and grotto-heavens,\nThe Earth Prison

Great Luminaries,\nThe Four Pillars of Destiny,\nThe true immortals of the ten directions,\nAnd the innumerable hosts—\nAll came to bow their heads,\nListening to the teachings of the *Peacock Radiant King Sutra*,\nTo deliver beings from the sufferings of the world.\n\nThen, the Peacock Radiant King,\nRiding the Peacock Host,\nLed the Heavenly Kings, Rākṣasas, Jade Maidens, Māyā, Dragon Kings, and their retinues,\nApproaching from afar.\nHe addressed the assembly, saying:\n“I am the Teaching Master of the Heaven of Release,\nThe Tathāgata’s manifested form.\nIn the Dao, I am called the Sacred Mother and August Empress of Precious Moonlight.\nThe gates of Dao and Release share a single source of qi.\nThrough kalpas of cultivation, I have attained the true Dao.\nI vow that all beings in the world—\nWhether men or women, from life to death, or from death to life—\nMust resolve the Three Calamities and Eight Vows,\nDeliver from the nine misfortunes of adversity,\nAnd augment blessings and longevity.\nErase the names of the dead,\nInscribe them in the register of the living,\nIn the ledger of the Ten Fields of Blessing.\nStrike out their names from the Azure Scroll of Evil,\nAnd inscribe them in the Golden Tablet of Agelessness.\nShould any recite this scripture,\nTheir names shall be recorded in the immortal registers,\nNever to revolve in the wheel of rebirth,\nBut to enjoy all pleasures.\nShould one wish to deliver the nine ancestors and seven generations,\nTo free them from suffering,\nAscend directly to heaven,\nAnd together attain the fruits of blessedness—\nIf any dare to disrespect or slight this scripture,\nThe statutes and laws of the Dark Capital shall punish them,\nBringing disaster and subjecting them to penal judgment.”\n\nThereupon, the Peacock Radiant King bowed to the Heavenly Worthy,\nListening to the recitation of the *Venerable Peacock Radiant King Sutra*,\nWhich resolved the matter of the Dragon King of the Deep Pool descending into the scripture.\nHe vowed to rely on the merit of the scripture\nTo dispel misfortune without difficulty,\nAnd constantly receive protection and blessings.\nHe only wished that the Dragon King\nWould descend with great auspiciousness.\n\n**Determined Offering**\nGazing eastward to the Great Dragon King of Fusang,\nThe Great Dragon King of Jupiter’s Wood Virtue,\nThe Great Dragon King of Venus’s

virtue.\n\nThis scripture, in its origin, was discovered within the Wudang Great Peak.\nLi, the superintendent of the Purple Cloud Palace of Supreme Harmony, found a lost scripture of eighty-five scrolls within a cave behind the Cliff of Self-Abandonment. Appended to it was this Daoist Peacock Scripture in three scrolls.\nRetrieved from the cave’s depths and returned to the palace, it was revealed to be a convergence of Daoist and Buddhist teachings.\nThough some may doubt, I have preserved it within the palace. Unbeknownst, the scripture’s inherent power could not be concealed, and thus it is fitting to transmit it to the world.\nNow, copying the ancient text, we distribute it to all directions.\nShould Daoist priests recognize its sounds, chant, and recite it, their blessings shall be immeasurable.\nAbove, it repays the sovereign; below, it aids the three realms.\nThe nation prospers, the people are at peace, winds are harmonious, and rains are timely.\nAll people delight in their livelihoods, and everywhere reigns tranquility.\n\nIn the auspicious first full moon of the dingwei year, the thirty-fifth of the Wanli reign of the Great Ming (1607), the Orthodox Unity Lineage’s Successor-in-Doctrine, the Profoundly Sincere, Dao-Revealing, Teaching-Expounding, Great Perfected One—Zhang Guoxiang, who oversees all Daoist affairs under Heaven—was commanded by imperial decree to collate and print this scripture.\n\nHere ends *The Venerable Scripture of the Holy Mother Peacock Radiant King*.",

Three fascicles.*\n\n**Source of Base Text:** *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*\n\n---\n\n**The Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture of the Peacock Radiant King, Spoken by the August Mother of the Jade Emperor, the Queen of Precious Moonlight, Fascicle One**\n\nThe Dao speaks: At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy resided in the Heaven of Great Purity, within the Palace of Pure Tenuity in the Land of Floating Radiance, upon the Jeweled Terrace of Jade Nets, emanating nine-colored auspicious lights. Upon a nine-petaled lotus throne, phoenixes sang and simurghs cried, lions and white cranes encircled, while the Thunder Generals of the Four Directions and all the heavens gathered round.\n\nFormerly, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the fourth year of the Dragon Han era, the Earth Officials convened to deliberate the methods of the Southern Numinous Nether Calculations and the texts for delivering and rescuing beings. Before the Dao, the assembly expounded: the Great Emperor Ancestor of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder, the Great Emperor of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Spirits, the Four Brahmā Heavenly Kings, the Five Elders and Six Masters with the Four Sages, the True Lords of the Five Sacred Mountains, the Sage Emperors of the Five Marchmounts, the Source Kings of the Four Watercourses, the True Lords of the Five Celestial Granaries, the Eleven Great Luminaries, the Four Pillars of Destiny, the Four Directions’ Winding Deliverances, the Three Realms and Four Offices, the Heavenly Capital and Earthly Prisons, the Water Realms and Yang Ministries, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Three Officials and Great Emperors, the Four Ranks of Fire Officials, the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors, the Three Origins and Three Hundred Sixty-Five Degrees, the City Gods and Village Altars, the Plague Bureaus of the Judiciary, the Five Lakes and Four Seas of the world, the Nine Rivers and Eight Waters, the Twelve River Sources, the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, the Three Hundred Sixty Famous Mountains, the Eighteen Prisons of the Earthly Offices, the Twenty-Four Prisons of Fengdu, the Thirty-Six Prisons of Lady Qing, the Central Universal Torment, the Eighty-Four Thousand Layers of Ghostly Dungeons, the Great and Lesser Iron Enclosures, the Mountains of Swords and Lakes of Blood, the Gorges of Stone and Avīci Hell, the Ten Kings of the Nether Offices, the Two Hundred Twenty-Six Heavenly Kings, the Seventy Rakṣasī Women, the Twelve Jade Maidens of Incense Attendance, the Twenty-One Dragon Maidens, the Sixty-Four Māyā Women, the One Hundred Thirty Dragon Kings—each and all arrived to assemble. Bowing their heads in reverence, they paid homage, arrayed themselves in order, and stood in ranks to hear the proclamation of the scripture’s meaning.\n\nSuddenly, a Heavenly Mother arrived, riding a peacock. In the Buddhist teachings, she is the Peacock Tathāgata; in the Dao, she is the August Mother of the Jade Emperor, the Queen of Precious Moonlight. She gathered all the great benevolent deities of the Peacock Scripture to come and attend the Dharma-sound, take refuge in the Great Dao, and once more expound the numinous text of the Peacock’s virtue and power. She wished that within the Dao, she might resolve the calamities and hardships of all beings in the world.\n\nAt that time, the Peacock Radiant King circled thrice before the Heavenly Worthy and addressed him, saying: “We, the women of the two gates, today are fortunate to hear and behold your compassionate countenance expounding the scripture and Dharma. We beseech your deliverance and salvation. Whatever the ten entanglements, the karmic debts of three lifetimes, chronic illnesses and prolonged misfortunes, demonic specters and malevolent spirits, rebellious stars and constellations, curses and hexes, or all manner of disasters and misfortunes that afflict men and women in the world—if they but sincerely and reverently invite the good Dao, establish the scripture and Dharma in their homes, and perform the rites, all shall be dissolved. If their qi has not yet departed, they shall be spared from crossing over. Once the grievances of their karmic foes are resolved, they shall recover within three days. With pure body and mind, and fresh garments, they shall open the gates and announce to all the spirit shrines, specially summoning the soul and hastening the fate of so-and-so. They shall petition the Thunder Generals, receiving the talismanic commands of the Jade Purity and the august decrees of the Jade Emperor. Earnestly inviting Orthodox Unity Daoists—or three, five, or seven Daoist adepts—whether at home or in a Daoist abbey, they shall request the recitation of scriptures and repentances, light lamps, and perform the ritual circumambulation. Following the liturgical protocols in devotion, none shall fail to receive response. These are the wondrous words of the Heavenly Sovereign; all above shall act accordingly.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy proclaimed the commands to the Thunder Lords of the Five Directions, the Thunder Kings of the Five Directions, the Cloud and Thunder Envoys of the Eight Directions, the Marshal Generals of the Thunder Department, and the Investigative Envoys of the Nine Heavens. Each issued orders and decrees, bowed their heads in reverence, took refuge, and pledged to obey.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy spoke *The Scripture of the Peacock Radiant King, Spoken by the August Mother of the Jade Emperor, the Queen of Precious Moonlight*.\n\nThis scripture, in truth, is the marrow of the Great Cavern Scriptures, the transformative work within the scriptures, the application within the scriptures. For this reason, it was widely transmitted to the world below. Those who receive this Dharma-sound bow their heads to listen to the Dao.\n\nThen, the great assembly again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “From of old, the Primordial Worthy bestowed it upon the August Mother of Precious Moonlight; the August Mother bestowed it upon the August Earth Queen, the Earthly Thearch; the Earthly Thearch bestowed it upon the Three Officials, Four Sages, and Five Elders of the Lofty Perfected; the Five Elders bestowed it upon the Five Masters; the Heavenly Master in turn bestowed it upon the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Great Compassionate and Great Ultimate Universal Assembly, the Azure Net Savior from Suffering and Universal Savior Perfected One, Lord Xu. It was transmitted down through the generations. At one time, the Perfected of Fixed Radiance propagated the wondrous canon, proclaimed the teachings and Dharma, and universally saved all men and women in the world. Should calamities arise, with sincere heart they may burn incense, present memorials and petitions, recite scriptures and perform repentances, submit sincerity and pledge devotion, offer fresh fruits of the season, invite the Dao and welcome the Perfected. With earnest devotion, they shall recite *The Venerable Scripture of the Peacock Great Radiant King*, and reverently pray. In a basin of water, they shall burn the petition for resolving calamities, dispatching it to the Controller of Destinies, sweeping away demonic influences, and receiving the response of blessings. There is none that shall not be spiritually efficacious. To save a single life in the world is to accumulate ten kinds of merit. Together, they shall amass hidden merit and jointly realize the non-action.”\n\nThis is the arcane and wondrous liturgy, the secret transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas. If there are men and women in the world who, with sincere intent, proclaim and recite it to save beings, their fortune and longevity shall be boundless.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke a gāthā, saying:\n\n*All voices chant in succession...*",

This sutra is exalted and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. For you and all others, I expound the causes of eliminating transgressions and extinguishing sins in the hells.\"\n\nThen the Savior-from-Suffering Celestial Venerable arrived and assembled in great compassion, dissolving all karmic offenses in the hells for sentient beings and rescuing those sunk in suffering. If there are beings who broadly cultivate good causes and make various offerings, they may first deliver their nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages, ascending to heaven, transforming into human rebirth, and only then can they save others from calamities. Liberated from suffering and ascending, they broadly establish merit, opening vast fields of blessings.\n\nSummoning the eight divisions of devas and dragons, the ten generations of earth deities, the Four Brahma Heavenly Kings, the asura celestial kings, King Yama, the officials of Mount Tai—Minister of Destiny, Recorder, Merit Officer, Executioner—the Five Paths Great Spirits, the lords of hell, the underworld officials and scribes, the bureaucrats, clerks, and ghostly soldiers of the Northern Darkness Fengdu, all reverently prostrate, bow their heads, and address the Celestial Venerable, saying: \"The karmic retributions endured by sentient beings in the world are all governed by the great demonic obstructions of sin. In the Jambudvīpa realm, those who commit the ten evils and five rebellions, who are unfilial to parents, who break fasts and violate precepts, who slaughter and cook sheep, cattle, horses, the six livestock, flying birds, and running beasts—after death, they all enter the nine dark hells. Day and night they suffer without release. Without broadly cultivating merit, establishing fasts, and making offerings, even if they accumulate merit through torture and confinement in dark prisons, none will ascend to heaven.\"\n\nThen the Celestial Venerable, day and night contemplating sentient beings, said: \"You should heed my words. When any sinful person dies, or when men, women, parents, or kin pass away in the world, you should establish a Daoist altar, perform rituals, scatter flowers, and broadly offer resources. Conduct repentance fasts, and the underworld will measure their deeds. Those with merit will have their transgressions dissolved by blessings; those without merit will endure karmic retribution. Ten thousand taels of gold cannot be taken with you. Only a few scrolls of true scripture, unbound and unrestrained, can be relied upon. Though gold is precious, it cannot secure your future. Those who recite this sutra will all attain liberation. Though this sutra is subtle, it can save the living and the dead.\"\n\nThen all prostrated and bowed, entreating the Celestial Venerable to expound and leave behind the names of the Ten Courts of Hell and their officials, broadly making them known.

      "translated_text": "All [respond].\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Venerable, for the sake of all those in the underworld subjected to interrogation and torture, and for the people who, after death, sink into hell—when the Dark Bureau’s virtuous assemblies govern their deliverance, the hells become naturally unobstructed and empty. Their transgressions are extinguished, and they do not pass through hell. Suffering and bitterness are entirely without hindrance.\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable issued a decree, commanding the Left Bureau’s Yang Officials and the Right Bureau’s Yin Officials to weigh merits and virtues. The interrogating officials of Fengdu’s twenty-four prisons released all suffering ghosts and wandering souls, who then ascended the Fire-Refining Pool. Each assumed a transformed body, holding the cinnabar talismans of the numinous realm to protect their rebirth. Once more, they emerged into the world, attaining human existence. They took refuge in the Daoist and Buddhist teachings, revered the Three Treasures, and served their lords with loyalty and filial piety. They gained carefree freedom, abiding with the Dao in perpetuity.\n\nThus, the Heavenly Venerable universally delivered all sentient beings and suffering sinners, enabling their transcendence. All you sentient beings, listen carefully. I shall now proclaim for you the incantation for extinguishing sins and ascending as immortals:\n\n*\"Fengdu’s night stands firm,\nsuddenly radiant light shines.\nIlluminating the hidden souls,\nthey ride the fragrant porridge’s steam.\nNuminous talismans refine in fire,\na hundred bones take flight.\nWitnessing the Dharma assembly,\nimmortal maidens know the way home.\"*\n\nAnother verse is recited:\n\n*\"A chance in ten thousand kalpas,\nthe immortal affinity is revered.\nOpening the hidden path’s secrets,\nall relies on the true wind.\nBoundless salvation and grace,\nthought by thought, karma arises.\nRiding the light through the sky,\nthe deceased are delivered.\nNine generations ascend to heaven,\nthree lineages escape suffering.\nSeven ancestors rise,\ndisciples and all kin.\nThe household thrives in peace,\nprayers answered by the divine.\nForm and origin are reborn,\nfood and drink reveal their savor.\nDisasters dissolve, calamities avert,\nlifespan extends.\nThe whole family shines in glory,\nkinfolk live in harmony.\nProtected and at peace,\nthe stars move in accord.\nFortune and emolument grow,\nfive virtues bring celestial blessings.\nThe four luminaries rise in splendor,\nGreat Yin and Great Yang.\nVictory and felicity flourish,\nthe twenty-eight constellations.\nLong blessings dispel misfortune,\nmalevolent stars retreat.\nFortune and longevity shine in glory—\nhasten to report to Mysterious Heaven!\nAvert calamity and distress,\nboth the living and dead benefit.\nMisfortune departs, fortune arrives.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees!\"*\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable addressed the Most High Lord Lao: \"The sentient beings of the Three Realms drift in the sea of suffering, without liberation. How can you bear this? You must diligently uphold the secret instructions to universally deliver them all.\"",

the Peacock Host,\nLed the Heavenly Kings, Rākṣasas, Jade Maidens, Māyā, Dragon Kings, and their retinues,\nApproaching from afar.\nHe addressed the assembly, saying:\n“I am the Teaching Master of the Heaven of Release,\nThe Tathāgata’s manifested form.\nIn the Dao, I am called the Sacred Mother and August Empress of Precious Moonlight.\nThe gates of Dao and Release share a single source of qi.\nThrough kalpas of cultivation, I have attained the true Dao.\nI vow that all beings in the world—\nWhether men or women, from life to death, or from death to life—\nMust resolve the Three Calamities and Eight Vows,\nDeliver from the nine misfortunes of adversity,\nAnd augment blessings and longevity.\nErase the names of the dead,\nInscribe them in the register of the living,\nIn the ledger of the Ten Fields of Blessing.\nStrike out their names from the Azure Scroll of Evil,\nAnd inscribe them in the Golden Tablet of Agelessness.\nShould any recite this scripture,\nTheir names shall be recorded in the immortal registers,\nNever to revolve in the wheel of rebirth,\nBut to enjoy all pleasures.\nShould one wish to deliver the nine ancestors and seven generations,\nTo free them from suffering,\nAscend directly to heaven,\nAnd together attain the fruits of blessedness—\nIf any dare to disrespect or slight this scripture,\nThe statutes and laws of the Dark Capital shall punish them,\nBringing disaster and subjecting them to penal judgment.”\n\nThereupon, the Peacock Radiant King bowed to the Heavenly Worthy,\nListening to the recitation of the *Venerable Peacock Radiant King Sutra*,\nWhich resolved the matter of the Dragon King of the Deep Pool descending into the scripture.\nHe vowed to rely on the merit of the scripture\nTo dispel misfortune without difficulty,\nAnd constantly receive protection and blessings.\nHe only wished that the Dragon King\nWould descend with great auspiciousness.\n\n**Determined Offering**\nGazing eastward to the Great
