  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture of Internal Alchemy**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture of Internal Alchemy*. One scroll. Author unknown. Based on the Ming Dynasty *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Section of Divine Writings*, category of original texts.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said: Those who seek the Dao of longevity, enduring vision, and immortality must first cultivate the heart and rectify conduct before refining qi. The Dao consists of three grades: the highest is the Returned Elixir and Golden Fluid, the middle is the Divine Water and Flowery Pond, and the lowest is the Five Metals and Eight Minerals. Defense also has three grades: the highest is the Immortal Embracing the One, the middle is Enriching the Nation and Pacifying the People, and the lowest is Strengthening the Army and Securing Victory. Attaining even one of these suffices for all matters!\n\nThe Immortal Embracing the One: the Jade Crucible blazes, the Maiden is dignified, the Infant is tender, the root is deep and the stem firm, the Five Phases harmonize, and the Eight Trigrams interconnect—this is the highest.\n\nEnriching the Nation and Pacifying the People: the Dragon coils around the Golden Tripod, the Tiger encircles the Cinnabar Field, true black-and-white gold, the treasures of Lead and Mercury, Water and Fire in mutual completion, the Sun and Moon radiating brilliance, a single wheel of fire, the Nine-Year Elixir Tortoise—this is the middle.\n\nStrengthening the Army and Securing Victory: a grand hall expands, three peaks verdant, manifesting the hearts and intentions of husband and wife, releasing the Dragon and Tiger to come and go, the two Mysterious Gates and the Mud Pill Palace as one—this is the lowest.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said: Those who refine the Great Elixir must diligently practice virtue and purify body and mind. Secluded in the profound stone caves of remote mountains, cut off from birds and dogs, severing right and wrong, neither seeing external things nor hearing external sounds, guard the heart within and seek nothing without. In cultivating the Dao, one must first cultivate the heart. To cultivate the heart is to still it. When the heart is stilled, inner visions do not arise, and outer visions do not enter; within and without are tranquil, the spirit settles and qi harmonizes, and primordial qi naturally descends—this is the true Dao of immortals.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said: The sage takes the body as the nation and the heart as its ruler. When the heart is upright, all dharmas follow; when the heart is chaotic, all dharmas are abandoned. Furthermore, take essence and qi as the people: when the people are at peace, the nation thrives; when the people scatter, the nation declines.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said: The method of nurturing life and the Dao of preserving the body lie in stabilizing qi to secure essence, and nourishing spirit with essence. When spirit does not leave the body, the body remains ever healthy. In cultivating the Great Dao, one benefits the nature of living beings, awakens human wisdom, enables people to attain the Dao, and receives the qi of celestial emptiness.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said: When the heart harbors love, do not love excessively. When the heart harbors hatred, do not hate excessively. If you sense bias, correct it immediately. Those in wealth should not assume it will last forever; those in poverty should not assume it will never end. Amidst wealth and poverty, one should always uphold the Dao. The Dao is not in complexity; the heart must not be chaotic. Do not think of clothing and food, do not think of desires, do not think of fame and profit, do not think of honor and disgrace. Embrace the One and guard the center—this is the natural Dao.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said: Those who refine the Great Elixir must firmly guard the furnace and tripod, reverse aging to regain youth. When merit is complete and conduct perfected, qi transforms into blood, blood into essence, and essence into marrow. In one year, qi is replenished; in two years, essence is replenished; in three years, the vessels are replenished; in four years, the flesh is replenished; in five years, the marrow is replenished; in six years, the sinews are replenished; in seven years, the hair is replenished; in eight years, the bones are replenished; in nine years, form and spirit are transformed. Within the body reside thirty-six thousand spirits of radiant essence, dwelling without dispersion. The body becomes immortal: clouds arise beneath the feet, cranes dance atop the head—this is called longevity. With unceasing cultivation, the joints connect, the five viscera become firm, inner qi does not leak, outer qi does not enter, cold and heat cannot invade, blades cannot harm. Ascending and transforming, one’s lifespan equals heaven and earth. Jade maidens attend, jade lads follow; above, one assists the Jade Emperor; below, one delivers the common people—this is called a Perfected One.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said: Within the Mysterious lies the Mysterious—this is my life. Within life lies life—this is my form. Within form lies form—this is my essence. Within essence lies essence—this is my qi. Within qi lies qi—this is my spirit. Within spirit lies spirit—this is my natural Dao.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said: The body of longevity and the gate of enduring vision lie in purifying the heart and rectifying conduct, thereby attaining true perfection. Thus, eliminate delusive thoughts and transform things; strive to master the six senses. Demonic influences will depart afar, and all illnesses will have no cause. Penetrating the obscure and manifesting the sacred, nothing will fail to become real. One must understand the indistinct and subtle, aided by the Imperial Lords.\n\nThe Supreme One said: Why gaze upward to the Three Pure Ones when they reside within? Why seek the Supreme Lord Lao without when he is within? Knowing this and cultivating it—this is called a sage.\n\nHere ends *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture of Internal Alchemy*.",
