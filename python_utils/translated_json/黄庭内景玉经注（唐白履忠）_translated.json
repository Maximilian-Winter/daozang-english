Reciting it harmonizes the Six Palaces (六府), calms the mind and spirit, and grants immortality.\n\nIt is also called the *Dadi Jin Shu* (大帝金书), the sacred scripture recited in the palace of the Great Emperor of Fuxiang (扶桑大帝君), inscribed on golden tablets—hence *\"Jin Hui\"* (金会).\n\nIt is also called the *Shuhua Yupan* (束华玉篇). Donghua (东华) refers to the palaces of the Eastern realm, where the Qingtongjun (青童君) of the Eastern Sea resides. The immortal maidens and sages there recite and practice it, inscribing it on jade—thus *\"Yupan\"* (玉篇).\n\nOne must observe strict purity for ninety days, reciting the text ten thousand times, to harmonize the Three Souls (三魂), refine the Seven Spirits (七魄), eliminate the Three Corpses (三尸), and balance the Six Palaces (六府). The Five Viscera (五藏) will flourish with vitality, the complexion will revert to youth, and no ailment or calamity shall harm the body. Upon completion, one will naturally perceive the spirits of ghosts and gods, internally observe the intestines and stomach, and behold the Five Viscera.\n\nAt this time, the Yellow Court True Person (黄庭真人) and the Jade Maiden of Shuhua (束华玉女) will appear to instruct the adept. This is the Way of Immortality. If you possess the marks of the Dao, you have obtained this sacred text.\n\nThis scripture maps the divine chambers of the body’s singular form—the abode of the embryonic spirit (胎神). Those who recite it constantly will illuminate the divine chambers, secure the embryonic spirit, circulate the celestial fluids (灵液), harmonize the hundred passages (百关), fill the blood and marrow, balance the intestines and stomach, and cause the Five Viscera to bloom with vitality. Hearing and sight will sharpen, gray hair will darken, and decayed teeth will regrow.\n\nThus, it repels the chaotic onset of illness, for one has mastered the six arrays of soul and essence (魂精六纬). With the body filled and the spirit at ease, death becomes unattainable—hence the name *Neijing Huangting* (内景黄庭).\n\nThe recipient must observe purity for nine days, seven days, or three days before receiving the text. The instructor is the teacher; the recipient must revere them.\n\n「To form a pact and take an oath, one must pledge not to divulge it. In ancient times, oaths were sealed with a black cloud brocade of ninety *chi* in length, a golden tablet with phoenix script wrapped in a silk cloth of forty *chi*, and nine pairs of golden buttons—these replaced the solemn vow of cutting hair and drawing enemy blood without betrayal. Such materials were sacred fabrics from the divine realm (*shénxiāng*), not common goods of the mortal world (*chìxiàn*).\n\nNow, the brocade may be substituted with white gauze (*báishāng*), the silk cloth with blue cloth (*qīngbù*), and the buttons with gold-plated ones (*jīnduàn*), which are still sufficient to bind the oath to the Nine Heavens and to admonish the Three Officials. All must revere the teacher who possesses the scripture; if the oath is broken, the Seven Ancestors will be summoned to the *Tānggǔ* River’s source for judgment, and one’s body will be tormented by the *Fēngdāo* (Wind Blade) as a ghost.\n\nThe *Tānggǔ* is the oral transmission of the Middle Mountain King. One who receives the scripture may pass it on to nine others. They must carefully examine the recipient’s *form* and *qi*—only those who are benevolent, loyal, and sincere, and who dwell in Dao/Way and embody truth (*zhuànxuán zhùzhēn*), may be taught without corrupting the true transmission. They should respect and delight in the Immortal Way. Only then may they be entrusted with it. If they lack such virtue, it is a risk of leakage; thus, selecting a worthy recipient is both prudent and difficult.\n\nMoreover, one should first seek signs of resonance and verify the recipient’s purity and subtlety (*xūlíng*) before transmission. When the recipient is deemed worthy, the teacher may also reveal it through dreams, and the timing of the transmission will be intuitively understood.\n\nThe penalties for divulgence are severe; those who pass it on must be cautious indeed—how could one with the *Neijing Huangting* scripture not be vigilant?\n\nThe *Qīngxū Zhēnkǒu Mìjìng* (Oral Transmission of the Pure and Empty Immortal) states: The *Neijing Huangting* scripture is the golden text of the Great Emperor of the *Dàsāng* (Morning Sun), a secret teaching for refining the True Self (*liànzhēn*). Those who read the *Neijing Huangting Jing* should do so in a secluded chamber, burning incense and purifying their vessels (*jìngshèng*), before taking up the text. All who possess this scripture are protected from a hundred evils (*bǎi xié*).\n\nIf one enters mountains, forests, or shadowy places and feels shaken with dread, they should steady their mind, face north, and recite the *Neijing Jing* once. Their spirit will then quiet, and their intent will level—even as if journeying with a thousand others, the fear will cease. If one recites it ten thousand times (*wàn guò*), they will personally perceive the Five Viscera, intestines, and stomach, as well as all ghosts and spirits of the world, subject to their command.\n\nFor those afflicted with illness, if they hold the text in mind, even at the brink of death, they will be cured. Generally, one must avoid consuming the Six Livestock (*liùchù*), violent fish (*yúzào*), the Five Pungent herbs (*wǔxīn*), and acts of covering filth (*yǎnwū*). If one has stepped barefoot (*tuōlǚ*), they must bathe, rinse their mouth, burn incense on either side, and recite the scripture once—all maladies will then be dispelled.\n\nThe words of the Small Lord (*Xiǎojūn*) say: Before retiring at night, one should first recite the *Huangting Jing* once, then sleep. This allows the soul and spirit (*húnpò*) to self-regulate and refine, achieving three or four recitations (*guò*) being ideal.\n\nThe myriad teachings (*wànfǎ*) depend on humanity as their foundation, and humanity relies on the heart as its core. Without humanity, teachings cannot arise; without the heart, the body cannot stand. The heart’s teachings are many, and their application varies; they encompass both existence and nonexistence (*yǒuwú èr tǐ*), responding to circumstances and seizing opportunities.\n\nThus, there are distinctions between the mundane and the sage, shallow and profound, foolish and wise, true and false—none differ without the discernment of heart and spirit, nor without their proper application. Yet, all teachings of the world, though their paths vary, converge in their destination; all thoughts, though diverse, align in their purpose. From coarse to refined, from expedient to absolute, there are two stages; from falsehood to truth, from error to clarity, they ultimately harmonize in one vision.\n\nThose who hold the *Neijing Huangting Jing* are the guardians of the sacred Dao/Way (*shùhuá*). It is indeed the essential secret for learning the Immortal Way and the foundation for achieving *yùhuà* (transformation into a feathered immortal). Though my practice is still incomplete, my contemplation is coarse, I have yet glimpsed the myriad subtle essences and modeled a singular form.\n\nThere are four doctrines (*sì zōng*), and seven key characters (*qìzì*) to grasp; they point to phenomena and elucidate meanings, speaking of both inner and outer realms (*nèiwài liǎng yán*). In the midst of sharp hearing and angry body, during moments of inhaling and exhaling through the throat, or when licking the brush and grinding ink, I will often leave behind the original divinations (*yuánshuài*).»\n\nThe Yellow is the color of the central realm. The *Tíng* is the center of the four directions. Externally, it points to affairs: the celestial center, the human center, and the terrestrial center. Internally, it points to affairs: the center of the brain, the center of the heart, and the center of the spleen. Hence, it is called *Huángtíng*.\n\nThe Inner is the heart. The *Jǐng* is the form. Externally, the form refers to the phenomena of the sun, moon, stars, clouds, and mists. Internally, the form refers to the phenomena of blood, flesh, sinews, bones, and the viscera. The heart resides within the body, preserving the unity of form and color in observation, hence it is called *Nèijǐng* (Inner Form).\n\n**Chapter One of the Upper Clarity (Shàngqīng Zhāng)**\n\nBefore the *Zǐxué Xūhuáng* (Purple Vapor Emperor) of the Upper Clarity, within the realm of the *Sānqīng* (Three Clarities)—comprising *Yùqīng* (Jade Clarity), *Shàngqīng* (Upper Clarity), and *Tàiqīng* (Supreme Clarity)—this is where all the great sages dwell. According to the *Yùwéi Jīng* (Jade Canopy Scripture), the Upper Clarity is governed by the *Xūhuáng Dàdào Jūn* (Emperor of the Great Dao of the Purple Vapor), the domain of the Great Dao that encompasses the Three Clarities. He also presides over the daily rituals in the southwest direction, where the *Tàilíng Xūhuáng Tiānzūn* (Supreme Numinous Purple Vapor Celestial Venerable), known as the original title of *Yuánshǐ* (Primordial Beginning), resides.\n\nThe Dao Emperor wished to clarify the seven-word incantation (*qìzì*), thus beginning with the *Zǐxué guān* (Purple Vapor Office), also called the *Zǐqióng guān* (Purple Crystal Office) or the *Zǐchén guān* (Purple Dawn Office). The *Tàishàng Dàdào Yùchén Jūn* (Jade Dawn Lord of the Supreme Dao) is another title for the Supreme Venerable. According to the *Běnxíng Jīng* (Scripture of Original Conduct), this is also the title of the five senior lords of *Yuánshǐ* (Primordial Beginning). The Jade Dawn Lord is one of the titles for the *Huánglǎo* (Imperial Old One).\n\nIn leisure, the Dao Emperor resides within the *Yàozhū* (Pill Palace) and delivers the seven-word incantation. The *Bìyào Jīng* (Secret Essentials Scripture) states: Within the immortal court, there is the *Liáoyáng* (Luminous Yang) Hall, the *Yàozhū* (Pill Palace) Gate, and the Seven Reflections Chamber. The Dao Emperor dwells within and teaches the scripture. The human body possesses all these.\n\n**Dispersing and Transforming Five Forms to Change Myriad Gods**\nThis refers to gathering the limbs, abandoning sharpness and clarity, departing from form and discarding wisdom, aligning with the Great Unity, and progressing from the original to the refined—hence, assuming the guise of gods to manifest their applications.\n\nThe gods are those that respond to sensation, thus their number is manifold—how could it be limited to myriad? This is the *Huángtíng Rìnèi Piān* (Yellow Court Inner Form Scripture), deriving its name from the central realm.\n\n**Plucking the Heart in Three Layers, Dancing the Embryo to Achieve the Sage**\nPlucking (*qín*) is harmony; layers (*dié*) are accumulation. Preserving the three *dāntián* (elixir fields), making them harmonize and accumulate as one, allows the embryo sage (*tāixiān*) to be attained.\n\nThe embryo sage (*tāixiān*) is the sage of embryonic breathing (*tāixī*), akin to the embryo in the womb having breath but no respiration.\n\n**Nine Qi Manifesting and Illuminating, Emerging from the Celestial Questions**\nWithin the three elixir fields, there are nine radiant *qì* (vital energies). None are without illumination. The *Dàdòng Jīng* (Great Cavern Scripture) states: The three elixir fields, combined with the three *yuán* (primordial essences) and the three *dòngfáng* (cavern chambers), total nine offices (*guān*). Within these offices, the celestial sovereign’s nine *pò* (souls) transform into the nine *yángmò* (yang paths) and become the nine *qì* (vital energies), which further manifest as the nine gods (*shén*).\n\n**The Godly Essence Appears as a Child, Generating Purple Mist**\nThrough observation and contemplation, the mind assumes the task, borrowing the eyes to perceive.\n\n---\n\nThe following text speaks of the eyebrows as a *huágài* (flowery canopy) sheltering the bright pearl (the eyes).\nThe *huágài* is the **Godly Canopy**, referring to the eyebrows.\nThe **Bright Pearl** is the **Eye Child** (innocent eye).\nThe **Purple Mist** is the refined *qi* (vital essence) of the eyes.\nThis is where the **Jade Scriptures** may be meticulously studied.\nThe text begins with broad principles, yet focus yields mastery.\nA thousand praises ascend to the Three Heavens,\nWhen the essence is complete and the spirit full, one attains the **Three Pure Ones** (上三清).\nA thousand calamities vanish, a hundred ailments heal—\nWhen the spirit is perfected and the essence is whole, calamities and diseases dissolve naturally.\nNo fear of the ferocity of tigers and wolves,\nFor the **Primordial Essence** is unharmed and the years of age are repelled.\nThis entire chapter expounds the **Dao of the Yellow Court**.\n\n**Chapter Two: The Upper Soul and Lower Guan**\nAbove is the **Upper Soul** (上魂), the celestial division.\nBelow is the **Lower Guan** (下关), the earthly division.\nThe **Soul and Spirit** (魂灵) cannot be shaped by human laws; they are formed by Heaven and Earth.\nThe **Left** is **Minor Yang** (少阳), the **Right** is **Major Yin** (太阴).\nThe **Left** is bound, the **Right** is extinguished.\nThe **Mao** (卯, 4–6 AM) generates, the **You** (酉, 4–6 PM) kills.\n\nBehind is the **Secret Aperture** (密户), before is the **Life Gate** (生门).\nThe **Life Gate** faces south, the **Secret Aperture** faces north.\nThe **Secret Aperture** is the rear two orifices, speaking of concealment.\nThe **Life Gate** is the front seven orifices, speaking of their role in life.\nTogether, they form the **Nine Orifices** (九窍).\n\n**Breathing with the Sun and Moon, Preserving the Essence**\nThe **Sun** and **Moon** are the essences of **Yin** and **Yang**.\n**Left** is exhalation, **Right** is inhalation—\nThe body holds the *qi* of **Yin** and **Yang**.\nBetween breaths, the mind must be preserved.\nThe *Shàngqīng Zǐwén* (Upper Clarity Purple Text) says:\nPreserve the mind with the **Sun** and **Moon**—\nWhether sitting or standing, this is the way.\nThe **Primordial Qi** (元气) converges with the **Lunar Lodges** (列宿), dividing them.\nThe **Primordial Qi** is singular—\nUniting the mind with the **Dao/Way**.\nPreserve the radiance of the **Sun**, **Moon**, stars, and constellations,\nIlluminating and arranging them—\nThe body becomes distinct, merging with Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Purple Mist Ascending and Descending: The Three Subtle Clouds**\nThe **Purple Mist** is the *qi* of the eyes.\nWithin the **Three Elixir Fields** (三丹田), above and below, white *qi* flows,\nWhite *qi* circulating as one body.\nFurther, it is said:\nThe **Eye Light** has three colors—**Purple**, **Azure**, and **Black**—\nThese are the **Three Subtle Clouds** (三素云).\nThe **Daoist Scriptures** state:\nThe **Cloud Forest Lady**’s incantation:\n*\"Eye Child of the Three Clouds, True Lords of the Two Eyes!\"*\nIrrigate the **Five Palaces** (五华) to cultivate the **Spirit Root** (灵根).\nThe **Subtle Clouds’** *qi*, when stored in the throat, becomes **Jade Fluid** (玉液).\nThe **Five Palaces** are the refined essences of the five **Zang Organs** (五脏).\nThe **Spirit Root** is the **Life Root**, planted and growing.\nThe **Seven Fluids** (七液) flow through the orifices,\nCirculating above and below—\nThe **Day of Surge** (冲日) flows upward, the **Day of Return** (回日) flows downward.\nThe **Lú** (庐, forehead) is within the **Bright Hall** (明堂).\nThe **Returning Purple Mist** embraces the **Yellow** and enters the **Elixir Fields**—\nAn inner symbol, as revealed.\n\nThe **Spleen’s** *qi* is **Yellow**, the **Eye’s** *qi* is **Purple**,\nThe **Seven Fluids** circulate in unison—\n**Embracing Yellow** and **Returning Purple**, inhaling and exhaling,\nAll converge into the **Elixir Fields**.\nThe **Elixir Fields** have three abodes—\nThe **Root of Life and Spirit**.\n\nAccording to the *Great Cavern Scripture* (《大洞经》):\nOne *cùn* behind the **brow** is the **Bright Hall Palace** (明堂官),\nLeft: **True Lord of the Bright Boy** (明童真君),\nRight: **True Official of the Bright Girl** (明女真官),\nCenter: **True Lord of the Mirror** (明镜神君).\n\nTwo *cùn* behind the **brow** is the **Cavern Chamber** (洞房),\nLeft: **True Lord of the Primordial Hero** (元英君),\nRight: **True Lord of the White Primordial** (白元君),\nCenter: **Soul of the Yellow Elder** (黄老魂).\n\nThree *cùn* behind the **brow** is the **Elixir Palace** (丹田官), also called the **Mud Pill Palace** (泥丸官),\nLeft: **True Lord of the Upper Primordial Red Boy** (上元赤子君),\nRight: **True Lord of the Imperial Official** (帝卿君).\n\nFour *cùn* deeper is the **Flowing Pearl Palace** (流珠官),\nWhere the **True Spirit of the Flowing Pearl** (流珠真神) resides.\n\nFive *cùn* deeper is the **Jade Emperor Palace** (玉帝官),\nWhere the **Jade Pure Spirit Mother** (玉清神母) resides.\n\nOne *cùn* above the **Bright Hall** is the **Celestial Court Palace** (天庭官),\nWhere the **Upper Pure Spirit Maiden** (上清神女) resides.\n\nOne *cùn* above the **Cavern Chamber** is the **Supreme Truth Palace** (极真官),\nWhere the **Supreme Emperor Consort** (太极帝妃) resides.\n\nOne *cùn* above the **Elixir Palace** is the **Elixir Mystery Palace** (丹玄官),\nWhere the **Central Yellow Supreme Unity Lord** (中黄太一君) resides.\n\nOne *cùn* above the **Flowing Pearl Palace** is the **Supreme Sovereign Palace** (太皇官),\nWhere the **Supreme Lord** (太上君) resides.\nThe **Hun** (雄一) is for males, the **Yin** (雌一) is for females;\nThe **Hun-Yin** (雄雌) two spirits—\nBoth males and females may cultivate them together.\n\nThe **Dark Chamber** illuminates the **Bright Hall’s** **Yang Gate** (阳门).\nThe **Hidden Chamber** holds self-reflection—\nThe **Mind and Eye** as clear mirrors,\nBurning like the **Sun and Moon**.\n\nThe **Spirit** is boundless—\nThe **Mind’s** perception knows no limits;\nWhen stored, it exists; when abandoned, it vanishes.\n\nThe **Mouth**—**Third Palace of the Jade Pool, Great Harmony** (玉池太和官)\n\nThe **saliva within the mouth** is the **Jade Elixir** (玉液), also called **Lingquan** (醴泉) or **Jade Nectar** (玉浆).\nIt stores water as a **pool**, softening the hundred joints,\nharmonizing the five viscera—\nall governed by the **Mouth Palace** (官主).\n\n*One text reads* **Great Harmony Palace** (太和官), but this disrupts the rhyme.\n\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* (大洞经) states:\n*\"Within the heart, at the stomach’s mouth, there stands a maiden,*\n*resembling a young brother, clad in no garments,*\n*upright in the stomach’s passage,*\n*her mouth open, receiving the soul’s elixir,*\n*inhaling the five breaths upward.*\n*When the mouth is rinsed full—both inner and outer saliva—*\n*swallow it whole; it descends straight into the **Mysterious Lady’s River** (玄女江).*\n\n*After five rinses, strike the teeth three times,*\n*and softly chant:*\n*'Jade Purity, Most High—*\n*nine heavens, nine spirits,*\n*transformed in the Mysterious Lady,*\n*descend into the Stomach’s Clarity.*\n\n*Gold harmonizes with Jade, reflected—*\n*the heart opens, the spirit brightens,*\n*consuming daily essence,*\n*Gold’s brilliance overflows.*\n\n*Rinsing and swallowing the elixir—*\n*disasters cannot touch it.*\n*The elixir’s true *qi*—*\n*evil cannot invade the upright.*\n\n*The body emits luminous *qi*, fragrant as orchids,*\n*abstaining from the five grains,*\n*free of filth and dross.*\n\n*Dispelling a hundred evils, Jade refines the face—*\n*skin like frost and snow,*\n*graceful as a maiden.*\n*Those who diligently practice ascend to **Broad Cold** (广寒).*\n\n*Broad Cold*—a name for the **Northern Celestial Palace** (北方仙官),\n*also a mountain name, or **Shiguangxia** (尸广霞).*\n\nThe *Cavern of the True Scripture* (洞真经) says:\n*\"On the Winter Solstice,*\n*the Moon hides in the **Broad Cold Palace** (广寒之官),*\n*when it nurtures the Moon’s essence in the **Broad Cold Pool** (广寒之池).*\n*Heavenly beings pluck the **Green Flower’s** (青华) branches,*\n*to wipe away the Sun and Moon’s light.\"*\n\n*Day and night without sleep—true perfection.*\n*Diligently cultivate stillness and clarity,*\n*and you become a **True Person** (真人).*\n\n*The thunder roars, lightning strikes—*\n*the spirit dissolves into stillness.*\n*[Note: *Dímín* (泯泯) reads with level tone.]*\n\n*Adjust the spirit, regulate the *qi*—*\n*essence and soul serene and joyous.*\n*Even amid thunderous claps, no fear takes hold.*\n\n*It is also said:*\n*The thunder’s roar and lightning’s strike—*\n*this is the **striking of teeth** (叩齿).*\n*Striking the teeth while storing thought—*\n*this is the **spirit’s function** (神用);*\n*do not call it *dímín*.*\n\n---\n**Yellow Court Chapter Fourth**\n*The Yellow Court’s Inner Person wears **Brocade Robes** (锦衣).*\n*The Yellow Court’s Inner Person*—this refers to the **Dao Mother** (道母),\n*The Yellow Court True Person*—this refers to the **Dao Father** (道父),\n*both inherent within the human body.*\n\n*The Brocade Robes are complete with five colors—*\n*the true *qi* of the five viscera,*\n*all present within the three courts.*\n\n*The Purple Flower’s flying skirt—*\n*cloud-like *qi* entwined,*\n*as the *Ten Directions Scripture* (十方经) says:*\n*\"The Most High Jade Emperor’s robes are adorned with luminous, flying clouds—*\n*the attire of the immortals.\"*\n\n*The cinnabar-green branches, emerald sprigs—*\n*five colors of *qi* intertwined,*\n*forming branches and tendrils,*\n*the adornments of immortal garments.\"*\n\n**Yellow Court Chapter Fifth**\n*The Seven-Luo Jade Key seals the twin gates*—\nan external symbol, a teaching.\n\n*The seven orifices open and close by the Dao,*\nlest they be opened recklessly.\n*Luo*—the adornment of the key.\n\n*Store the spirit, cross the arms, and close the eyes,*\nthus called *\"sealing the twin gates.\"*\n\n*The double gates, the golden pass, the hidden pivot.*\n*Gold*—taken for its firmness and rigidity.\n\n*Laozi says:*\n*\"The skilled at sealing shut the primal pass,*\n*and it cannot be opened*—\n*those who cultivate life guard the spirit well,*\n*lest it leak away.\"*\n\n*The dark spring, the hidden gate, lofty and towering,*\n*The dark spring*—the saliva in the mouth,\nalso called *Liquor of Jade*, or *Jade Dew*,\nlike a thick drink—\none name *Jade Spring*, one name *Jade Stream*,\none name *Jade Nectar*.\n\n*The space between the brows is the gate courtyard,*\n*the space between the kidneys is the hidden gate.*\nLike the left and right of a door,\nsymbolizing the *Wei* center’s gate—\n*the Dao.*\n\n*The kidneys lie deep within the body,*\nthus called the *hidden gate.*\nThough the kidneys are beneath the five viscera,\nwhen spoken of as *high*—\nthe form is submerged, the spirit stored,\nright above the *elixir field*,\nhence *high.*\n\n*Within the Three Fields, the vital essence is subtle.*\nAn inner reference to practice.\n\n*Within the elixir field,*\nthe spirit-*qi* transforms and responds,\nsensing as the heart directs—\nneither existence nor nonexistence,\nindescribable in form or image.\n\n*From coarse to subtle,*\ncrossing into mystery—\nits ties are bound.\nThus speaking of *qi*,\n*qi* takes the heart as master,\nestablishing its form.\nMost refined, most subtle—\nbeyond counting or seeking.\n\n*The Dao Machine Scripture says:*\n*\"Heaven has three luminaries—sun, moon, stars—\nman has three treasures, three elixir fields.*\n*Within the three elixir fields, the qi*\n*—left green, right yellow,*\n*above white, below black.\"*\n\n*A graceful maiden, slender and veiled,*\n*her radiance dimming the celestial glow.*\n*The True Revelations say:*\n*\"Graceful maiden\"*—the name of the ear spirit,\nspeaking of keen hearing, piercing clarity,\nveiling the dark luminosity.\n\n*The double hall shines brightly,*\nilluminating the eight *Wei*.\n*The double hall*—the throat’s name,\nalso called *double tower*, *double ring*.\nThis scripture says:\n*\"The Vermilion Palace’s double tower,*\n*twelve tiers high.\"*\n*The Vermilion Palace*—the heart.\nThe throat lies above the heart,\nthus called *double hall*.\nThe throat—\nthe path of saliva,\nflowing freely above and below,\nnourishing the whole body,\nbrilliant in all eight directions.\nThe eight trigrams’ spirits are the *eight Wei*.\n\n*The celestial court, the earthly pass,*\nranked like axes and hatchets,*\n\nTwo brows idle as the Celestial Court.\nThe Lady of *Zǐwēi* blesses:\n*\"Open the Celestial Court,\ngrant me eternal life.\"*\n\n*\"Listed axes and hatchets\"*—speaking of valor and strength.\n\nThe *Lingtai* firm and unwaning.\nThe heart as *Lingtai*, saying the divine spirit dwells therein.\nWhen still, it guards the One;\nwhen moving, it preserves the spirit.\nThe spirit settled and secure,\nnever exhausted.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Central Pool**\nWithin the Central Pool, the spirit wears a crimson pearl.\nThe gallbladder is the Central Pool,\nthe tongue-root the Flower Pool,\nthe lower abdomen’s sac the Jade Pool—\nalso the common name for the three pools.\n\nThe gallbladder’s region:\n*\"Dragon flag spreads across the sky,\ncasting fire-bells.\"*\nThe crimson pearl—\nthe fire-bell’s garment.\n\nScarlet brocade cloud-robes, bearing tiger talismans,\nscarlet brocade embracing—\nthe hues of heart and lungs.\nAbove the gallbladder, thus called cloud-robes.\nThe talisman—\nthe talisman of fate.\nThe *Jiǔzhēn Sutra* says:\n*\"The

**store in the heart** a **Stomach’s** **maiden**, in the **form of an infant**, clad in **primordial robes**, standing upright within the **Stomach’s conduit**, **opening her mouth** to **receive the spirit’s fluid**, **inhaling the Five Qi**—when **saliva fills the mouth**, **swallow it internally and externally**, **sending it into the Mystic Woman’s** **mouth**. After the **Five Offenses** are **complete**, **knock the teeth three times**, **swallowing the saliva ninefold**.\n\n**Thus reaching the state of no-death**, the **Three Worms vanish**—\nThe *Cavern Spirit’s Decision* says: The **Upper Worm** is **white and green**, the **Middle Worm** is **white and yellow**, the **Lower Worm** is **white and black**.\nWhen **humans die**, the **Three Worms exit** as **corpse ghosts**, **each transforming** into **things**, **bringing harm to the form**—**striking and breaking them**. The remaining **myriad worms** all **perish with the corpse**.\nHence, **those who study immortality** must **deplete their essence**, **guard against the Five Emotions’** **qi**, then **consume

is **Peng Zhi**, making **people covet wealth and treasures**, **fond of anger and wrath**;\nThe **Lower Corpse** is **Peng Jiao**, making **people love fine clothing**, **indulging in young women’s** **charms**.\nAlso named the **Three Poisons**.\n\nThe mind and intent ever harmonious, flourishing in joy—\nThe **Dao** flows unimpeded.\n\nThe **qi** of the Five Peaks rises as **Peng** and **Heng**,\nThe **qi** of the Five **Zang** organs becomes the Five Peaks’ clouds.\n**Peng** and **Heng**—this is the flowing circulation of **Yuan** and **Yong** **qi**.\n\nNurture and irrigate the **Jade Hall** to repay oneself,\nThe **Jade Hall**, the **Nose Hall**—when the Three Worms are gone,\nTrue **qi** harmonized, entering and exiting the **Mysterious Female**,\nEndlessly unbroken, hence it is said to repay oneself.\n\nThe Five Forms complete and firm, free from calamity.\nThe Five **Forms** and Five **Zang** organs naturally correspond.\n\n**Upper Contemplation**, Chapter Sixteen:\n**Upper Contemplation**—the Three **Yuan** like strung pearls,\nThe Three **Yuan** refers to the **Yuan** of the Three Lights—Sun, Moon, and Stars—\nNot the Three **Yuan** of upper, middle, and lower.\n\nTheir radiance descends, illuminating the nine quarters,\nThe Three Lights above, illuminating below to the nine directions.\nThe nine quarters, the nine regions—\nEver preserving the

unchecked.\n\nThe **Three Spirits** return **jing**—old becomes young again,\nReturning **qi** and **shen** to the **Three Fields**—thus longevity is prolonged.\n**Hun** and **po** guard within, uncompetitive.\n\n*Hun* is **yang**, *po* is **yin**—each attaining its own,\nThus the *Yijing* says: *\"One yin, one yang—this is the Dao.\"*\n\nThe **Divine Pearl** is born within the belly, clasped in place,\nThe belly’s heart illuminated, pearls and jade emitted from the mouth.\nAccording to the *Five Spirits’ Ritual Decisions*:\n*\"Two brows’ midpoint, straight in one inch—this is the **Jade

lower—each a separate realm,\neach a square inch in circumference, hence *\"three inches.\"*\nEven now, people still call the heart *\"the square inch\"*—one place.\n\nAsk of the **Gatekeepers**, the **Ying-Wei**—high and profound.\nThe **Three Fields** each have their **Gatekeepers**,\n**Ying** and **Wei** divided—most exalted, most mysterious.\nThe heart must receive and store the thought.\n\nThe **Cavern Chamber’s Purple Extremes**—**Lingming’s Gate**,\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* says:\n*\"Two brows’ midpoint, straight up three *fen*—this guards the **Double Fields of the

Pure Worthies of the Jade Chamber**—\nSymbolizing the skeletal frame.\n\n**Lady of the Näihuan** stands at the center,\nThe *Scripture* says: *\"Within the Cavern Chamber are Father and

**Scripture** says: *\"Inch-fields, foot-estates.\"*\nThe **sixteen-foot-estate** refers to the face.\nIf one **decides to spill the sea** with reckless excess—\n**Chamber indulgence**, unaware of

states:\n*\"Close the Chamber, refine the fluids—\nspeak not much, spit not far.*\nTo do otherwise is to perish.\n\n**Exclusively closing** to **ward off the scene** brings eternal

chanting these sixteen characters,\n**close the eyes, grip firmly**,\nand **visualize the five-colored flowing clouds** approaching to envelop the body.\nThus, the **sunlight and clouds** enter the

saliva nine times**.\n\n**Preserve my **Dantian’s** three wondrous spirits**—\nthe **Dantian**, the **Upper Dantian**.\n\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* says:\n*\"When the Three Primordials conceal

with the five characters of **Midday**: *\"珠景照韬绿映回霞赤童玄炎\"*—the **Sun-Spirit’s** radiant light illuminates the **Scarlet City**, casting emerald reflections and crimson clouds, the **Six Dragons** soaring.\n\nAfter completing the incantation, close your eyes and hold firm, nurturing the **Five Colored Flows** and **Crimson Clouds** to merge with your body. Then, swallow the sunlight and crimson clouds into your mouth, calling it the **\"Sunlight Flying to the Root, the Jade Embryo.\"** The **Jade Embryo** is the **Water Mother**. Swallow the **Crimson Clouds** forty-five times, then also pass saliva nine times through the throat.\n\n---\n\n**Preserve my *Níwán* (泥丸) and the *Three Strange Spirits* (三奇灵).**\nThe *Níwán* is the **Upper Elixir Field** (上丹田). The *Da Dòng Jīng* (《大洞经》) states: *\"When the Three Primordials (三元) refine in seclusion, they become the Three Officials (三官).\"*\n\nThe **Three Strange Spirits** (三奇灵) are:\n1. The **Spirits of the Three Pure Ones** (太清之中三君),\n2. The **Deities of the Three Elixir Fields** (三丹田之神),\n3. The **Divine Records’ Spirits** (符籍之神).\n\n**Calmly and quietly, close your eyes to inner illumination**—\nthis refers to **meditating on the Three Elixir Fields** as previously described.\n\n**Things do not disturb the *Tài* (泰) and remain balanced;**\n**practice the true Dao without deviation,**\n**and malevolent influences will not intrude.**\n\n**Replete with vitality, no longer old yet youthful again,**\n**wild beasts dare not approach,**\n**and ravenous crows dare not swoop.**\nThe **old become strong, the sick regain vigor.**\n\n**Replete with vitality (殷矣), yet not engaging in worldly affairs (匪事),**\n**the body remains firm and resilient (老复丁).**\n\n**Refine the *Yùshū* (玉书) into the **Upper Pure Realm** (上清).**\n**Concentrate on the inner landscape,**\n**and you shall gain the **Way of the Immortal** (仙道).\n\n**Always recite the *Second Twenty-Two* (章第二十二) and**\n**meditate on the **Three Chambers** (三房) to achieve mutual penetration.**\nThe **Three Chambers** are the **Chambers of the Hall of Light (明堂), the Cave Chamber (洞房), and the Elixir Field (丹田).**\nThey connect with the **Flowing Pearl (流珠), Jade Emperor (玉帝), Celestial Court (天庭), Supreme Truth (极真), Mystic Elixir (玄丹), Níwán (泥丸), and the Great Sovereign (太皇)**—\n**all harmonize above, below, left, and right.**\n\n**Understanding the vision sees no distinction between inner and outer;**\n**meditating on the Elixir Field (丹田),**\n**three times three makes nine (三三如九),**\n**uniting into one (合为一),**\n**illuminating and penetrating with clarity—**\n**no longer any inner or outer.**\n\n**Rinsing and storing the **Five Teeth’s qi** (五牙) prevents hunger and thirst.**\nThe *Língbǎo* (《灵宝》) contains a method of **serving and refining the Five Teeth’s qi.**\nThe **Five Teeth’s qi** are the **vital breaths of the Five Phases (五行),**\n**aligned with the **original essences of the Zang** (五脏元精).\nThe **classic** states:\n*\"On the day of the **Spring Equinox** (立春), when the geese’s cry resounds,*\n**enter your chamber facing east, bow nine times,*\n**sit upright, and strike your teeth nine times.**\n**Meditate on the **Nine Thousand Million Celestial Officials** (九千万人) of **Bùfāng Ānbǎohuálín Qīnglíng Shǐlǎo Dìjūn** (束方安宝华林青灵始老帝君),*\n**descending into your room in dense clouds,*\n**covering your body as if with mist,*\n**entering through your mouth and

qi.**\n\n**The **Divine Light** (神华) holds the **Six Ding** (六丁) in reverence.**\nThe **Divine Light** (神华), as the *Yù Lì Jīng* (《玉历经》) states,\n**is the **Jade Maiden of the Great Yin’s Mystic Light** (太阴玄光玉女),**\n**the **Mother of the Dao** (道之母).\n**She wears a **Five-Colored Vermilion Robe** (五色朱衣),**\n**above the **spleen** (脾腑), beneath the **Yellow Cloud Canopy** (黄云华盖).**\n\nThe **Six Ding** (六丁) are the **Six Ding Yin Spirits of the Jade Maiden** (六丁阴神玉女).\nThe *Lǎojūn Liùjiǎ Fú Tú* (《老君六甲符图》) states:\n**The *Dingmǎo* (丁卯) Spirit oversees **Mǎ Qīng** (马卿) and the Jade Maiden, who **controls the sun’s movement** (足日之).**\n**The *Dīngchǒu* (丁丑) Spirit oversees **Zhào Zǐ** (赵子) and the Jade Maiden, who **harmonizes the breath** (顺气).**\n**The *Dīnghài* (丁亥) Spirit

**Six Ding Spirits** (六丁之神).**\n\n**Vigilantly guard the **Chamber of Essence** (精室),**\n**never leaking recklessly.**\n\nThe **Chamber of Essence** (精室) refers to the **Three Elixir Fields** (三丹田).\nAbove and below, they are **interconnected yet unbroken** (上下资连而不绝),\nand their governance lies in the **heart** (心).\nThe **heart** (心) is the **Middle Elixir Field** (中丹田),\nthe source of **urgency and calm** (缓急之所由),\nand the **root of true and false** (真妄之根本).\nTo **seal and treasure it** (闭而宝之) is to **prolong life** (可长活).\nIt is the consequence of **accumulating essence** (积精之所致).\nInitially, it arises from within the **form** (形) without broadness (初不阔),\n**refining the heart to regulate the qi** (调心使气),\nsubtle and formless (微妙无形).\nThe **Three Palaces** (三宫) lie close within the **easy-to-conceal grasp** (易隐括).\nThat is, the **Three Elixir Fields’ true officials** (三丹田真官) are near the body,\n**concealing and gathering essence-qi** (隐括精气),\never maintaining the **heart as sovereign ruler** (常以心为君主).\n\nThe **void and stillness of the Primordial Origin** (虚元寂寂) dwells in the **emptiness of the heavens** (空中素#19),\nan **external analogy** (外指事).\n\"**Void**\" (素) has two interpretations:\nTo **prevent the form from being soiled** (使形如是不当污),\nor to **keep the form light and cool** (使形轻冷),\nas though **hanging unadorned silk in the sky** (如悬缣素於空中).\nIt is also said: **within the body, emptiness and stillness are natural** (身中空虚),\nmaking it like **a vessel’s lacquered void** (虚静当然，如器之漆素).\n**Soiling** (污) means **having any affairs** (谓有其事).\n\nThe **Nine Chambers’ upright void** (九室正虚) is the **abode of the Spirit of Clarity** (神明舍).\nThe **Nine Chambers** (九室) refer to the **Nine Officials’ Chambers within the head** (头中九官之室)\nand the **Nine Orifices of the body** (人之九窍).\nTo **honor the upper officials** (使上官荣华)\nand **upright the Nine Passages** (九康真正) is to **unite all spirits** (则众神之所止合).\n\nThe *Tóngshén Jīng* (洞神经) states:\n**\"Heaven has Nine Stars** (天有九星), two hidden, hence called Nine Heavens (故称九天).\n**Earth has Nine Officials** (地有九官), hence called Nine Earths (故称九地).\n**Man has Nine Orifices** (人有九窍), hence called Nine Births (故称九生),\nspeaking of the **origins through which man is born** (言人所由而生).\"\n\n**Cultivate and reflect on the hundred thoughts** (存思百念),\n**observing the nodes and measures** (视节度):\nTo **cultivate and reflect within the body on the hundred spirits** (存念身中百神),\n**inhale and exhale above and below** (呼吸上下),\njust as the methods prescribe (一如科法).\nThe text says: **\"Thousands upon thousands, hundreds upon hundreds like layered mountains** (千千百百似重山),\nall are **spirit-forms** (皆神象).\"\n\n**Refine the Six Palaces** (六府修治) and **do not let them remain stagnant** (勿令故).\nAccording to the *Tóngshén Jīng* (洞神经):\nThe **Six Palaces** (六府) are:\nThe **lung as the Jade Hall Official, Minister of State** (肺为玉堂官尚书府),\nthe **heart as the Vermilion Official, Palace of Original Yang** (心为绛官元阳府),\nthe **liver as the Cool and Pure Official, Blue Gallery Palace** (肝为清泠官兰台府),\nthe **gallbladder as the Purple Darkness Official, Palace of the Boundless** (胆为紫微官无极府),\nthe **kidneys as the Profound Bright Official, Palace of Great Harmony** (肾为幽昌官太和府),\nand the **spleen as the Central Yellow Official, Palace of Great Purity** (脾为中黄官太素府),\n**distinct from the common Six Palaces** (异於常六府).\n\nThen **ascend in soaring flight along the Heavenly Path** (行自翱翔入天路).\nThat is, **to transcend and become immortal** (谓升仙羽化).\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Third: Nurturing Life**\nThe Dao/Way of nurturing life is simple and unburdened—\n**effortless and pure**, **frugal yet steadfast in will**.\nOnly cultivate the *Dòngxuān* and the *Yùpiān*—\nThe *Dòngxuān* refers to the *Dòngxuān Língbǎo* (洞玄灵宝).\nThe *Yùpiān* is the **True Scripture**, that is, the **#20 *Huángtíng*** (黄庭).\n\n**Simultaneously practice the Eight Celestial Sceneries within the form** (兼行形中八景神),\nas the *Yùhuì Jīng* (玉讳经) states:\nThe **five viscera house the Eight Trigrams’ Heavenly Deities and Celestial Guards** (五脏有八卦天神宿卫).\n**The Eight Celestial Envoys** (太一八使者) govern the **Eight Solar Nodes** (八节日).\nThe **Eight Trigrams united with the Celestial Sovereign form the Nine Officials** (八卦合太一为九官).\nBeyond the Eight Trigrams lie the **Twelve Towers** (八卦外有十二楼), which are the **throats** (楼谓喉咙也).\n\nThe **umbilicus is the Celestial Sovereign’s Lord** (脐中为太一君), presiding over **one’s vital mandate** (主人之命也);\nit is also called the **#21 *Tàijí*** (太极), **#21 *Tàiyuān*** (太渊), **#21 *Kūnlún*** (昆仑), and **#22 *Chíqū*** (持躯),\ngoverning the **twelve thousand deities within the body** (主身中万二千神也).\nThe **Twenty-Four True Ones emerge naturally** (二十四真出自然),\nfor **Heaven possesses the Twenty-Four True Qi** (天有二#23十四真气), and so too does the human body.\nMoreover, the **Three Fields of Elixir** (三丹田) each contain **three groups of Eight, totaling Twenty-Four True Persons** (三八二十四真人),\nall manifestations of **the flourishing of the Dao/Way of Nature** (皆自然之道熙也).\n\n**Lofty and effortless, the spirit-soul rests in peace** (高拱无为魂魄安),\npracticing **standing forgetfulness and sitting forgetfulness** (行忘坐忘),\n**detaching from form and abandoning wisdom** (离形去智).\nWhen **pure and still, the spirit manifests and speaks with me** (清静神见与我言),\nthen **one can be pure and still, and the heart-spirit naturally manifests** (能清能静，则心神自见).\nThe **Celestial Sovereign’s True Scripture** (几览无外而与己言) is called the **#21 *Huángtíng Zhēnrén*** (黄庭真人).\nIt dwells **within the

the Two Complementaries are Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth generate all things, and all things ultimately return to the One.\nThe One is without duality—all things arise from it, and thus it is said they return to Unity.\n\n**The Triple-Five Convergence:** Three threes combine to form nine nines.\n*The Miao Zhen Jing* says:\nThe Three—heavenly as Sun, Moon, and Stars (the Three Lights); earthly as Pearl, Jade, and Gold (the Three Treasures); human as Ear, Nose, and Mouth (the Three Orifices)—are the essence of life.\nHeaven, Earth, and Man each encompass the Five, hence the Triple-Five, their eternal refinement.\nTheir convergence governs the Nine Officials.\nThe Triple-Five harmonizes all beings, regulates yin-yang transformation, sustains Heaven and Earth, illuminates the Four Seas, commands wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, and governs the seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer, cold, heat, warmth, and chill, as well as the clear and turbid *qi*. No living thing can exist without the Triple-Five.\nThus it is said: *\"The Dao of Heaven is near; the Triple-Five returns in cycles.\"*\n\nThe Triple-Five are the pivotal axis of Heaven and Earth, the crucial convergence of the Six Extremes, and the rhythmic *qi* of the Nine Officials—eighty-one nines forming a complete cycle.\n\n**Hidden Earth Returning to the Eight Arts:**\nWithin the Nine Officials lies the method of hidden retreat and transformation—*The Taishang Baxu Benchen Yin Shu* is called the *Eight Branches*.\n*The Taimi Baxu Yan* states:\nWithin the *Taimi* are the Three Lords: the First, the *Taihuang Jun*; the Second, the *Tianhuang Jun*; the Third, the *Huanglao Jun*.\nThe Three Primordial *qi* coalesce into refined essence, entering and exiting the Upper Purity *Taosu* Palace. By cultivating contemplation (*cunsi*), one attains longevity.\n\n**The Hidden Pass of the Ox and the Mysterious Gate:**\nThe *Funu* is the symbol of the kidneys.\nThe kidneys are the Hidden Gate.\n*The Zhonghuang Jing* says:\nThe left kidney is the *Xuanzuo Jun*, the right kidney is the *Xuanyuan Jun*.\nThe *Luopin Lie* appears through contemplation.\n\n**The Three Clarities Emerge at the Threshold of Life and Death:**\nThe Three Clarities of Heaven are Sun, Moon, and Stars;\nThe Three Clarities of Man are Ear, Eye, and Mouth;\nThe Three Clarities of Earth are Text, Patterns, and Splendor—\nThese mark the threshold of life and death.\n*Jie* means \"node.\"\n\n**The Soul’s Chamber and the Celestial Symbols of the Dipper:**\nContemplate the Three Lights within the Soul’s Chamber.\nThe Soul’s Chamber and the *Ming Tang* have been explained above.\n\n**The Father is the *Nihuan*, the Mother is the *Ci Yi*:**\nWithin the *Ming Tang* are Lord and Subject; within the Soul’s Chamber are Husband and Wife; within the *Dantian* are Father and Mother.\n*Nihuan* is the name of the brain spirit.\n*The Laozi* says: *\"Know the male, hold fast to the female.\"*\nThe female is the *wuwei* One.\n\n**The Three Clarities Illuminating the Chamber of the One:**\n\nThe Three Lights radiantly enter the Chamber of the One.\nThe Four Clarities spread in all directions.\nOne who can preserve the Mysterious True Self shall attain all things—\n*The Zhuangzi* says: *\"Unified in the One, all things are accomplished.\"*¹\n\nThe vital essence of the single body must never be lost.\nEver keep it in mind, not for a single moment.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: High Flight**\n\nHigh Flight follows the Sun and Moon—my Dao/Way ascends.\nI, the Dao/Way, am the Celestial Sovereign.\n*The Upper Clarity Purple Text: Method of Swallowing Solar Qi*, also called *The Scripture of the Golden Essence, Azure Elixir, and the Stone’s Mirror of the Mother’s Jade Embryo*.²\n\nIts method is: at dawn, facing east, strike teeth nine times to awaken.\nWhen done, softly chant the names of the Solar Spirit and the Five Emperors within the Sun:\n*\"Solar Spirit—Jewel, Mirror, Illumination, Concealment, Verdant, Echoing, Crimson, Infant, Mysterious Flame, Fleeting Symbol.\"*\nHaving chanted these sixteen characters, close eyes and grasp firmly,\nPreserving the five-colored flowing light to envelop the body—\nThus the Sun’s light and the flowing light together enter the mouth.\n\nAgain, *The Upper Clarity Purple Text* contains the method of Swallowing Lunar Essence:\nAt moonrise, facing west, strike teeth ten times,\nSoftly chant the names of the Lunar Spirit and the Five Ladies within the Moon:\n*\"Lunar Spirit—Warmth, Gentle Breeze, Fragrance, Luster, Veiled, Graceful, Mysterious, Resplendent, Lingering, Pure, Golden, Clear, Radiant, Jade, Embryo, Azure, Congealed, Court’s Inner Mirror.\"*\n³ Having chanted these twenty-four characters, close eyes and grasp firmly,\nPreserving the five-colored essence-light of the Moon to enter the mouth—\nAnd within the light, there is a yellow qi, vast as a child’s head,\nCalled *Flying Yellow*—the essence of the Moon’s Jade Embryo.\n\nOne who practices this Dao/Way shall High Flight with the Sun and Moon and become a transcendent.\n\n**Idyllic Compliance and Auspicious Binding Preserve the Form:**\nIdyllic Compliance is the High Flight of the Sun.\nAuspicious Binding is the High Flight of the Moon.\nLike sounds resonate, like qi seeks—\nThus the two transcendents come to preserve and uphold.\n\nThen one beholds the Venerable of Azure Clarity and the Void Primordial,\nAscending to the Three Clarities’ summit, merging with the Dao/Way.\n\nThis can restore youth and replenish the brain’s vitality.\nThe spirit and shadow return to infancy—\nOne attains the True Person.\n\n**Mouth Holding the Sacred Flame and the Five Sovereigns,**\nThe mouth emits five-colored clouds of light,\nRadiant in all directions,\nAnd plays with the Five Sovereigns’ Venerable Lord across the Six Extremes.⁴\n\n**Waist Belted with the Tiger’s Scroll and Golden Pendant,**\nThe attire of the transcendent.\n*The Nine True Scripture* says:\nThe Yellow Sovereign of the Central Peak wears the Dragon’s Mysterious Spirit Tiger’s Scroll,\nA waist belt with golden bells,\nHolds the purple-haired banner,\nAnd bears the talisman and scroll.\n\n**Riding the Swift to Attend the Birth Feast and Bind the Yellow Cloud.**\nSwift, meaning \"sudden efficacy\"—\nTo ride the wind-qi and depart in an instant.⁵\n\n「Some say: *Xióngxiào* (倏效) is the name of a dragon.\n*Shùméng* (束蒙) refers to the mountain realm of the *Shùhǎi* (束海) Immortals.\nThe method of *Jiēshēng* (接生) aligns with the vital *qi* of birth—\nOne attains serene ease and wanders there.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Refining the Spirit and Shadow of the Primordial Void**\nRefining the spirit and shadow of the Primordial Void,\nOne uses the refining to attain the One,\nThe One refined to merge with the One.\nThe One as a phenomenon is beyond mortal sight—\nThe One is the designation of the undivided.\nWith a tranquil mind, one attains it,\nKnowing it attained yet unseen.\n\nOnly when reaching the utmost truth does one look back upon the world,\nFulfilling the resolve of the True One,\nThe One returns to its own.\nMost forbidden is the *qi* of death and all filth,\nSuch as gathering *fēidān* (飞丹) elixirs, practicing *shǔqì* (吞霞) inhalation, or engaging in *shìqì* (食气) breathwork—\nAll these are forbidden from exposure to the dead or unclean burial rites,\nA shared taboo among those who uphold *wèishēng* (卫生) health.\n\nYet the highest Dao is boundless and empty,\nFundamentally free from cold and filth.\nBefore attaining the True Way,\nCold and filth differ greatly.\nUnequal yet distinct,\nThen contradictions arise within,\nLife and death manifest externally—\nThus, the cold and pure are the birth of vitality,\nThe turbid and impure are the birth of death.\nHence, these are the things forbidden in nurturing life.\n\nThe Six Spirits converge in the Void for a feast of ease.\nThe Six *Jiǎ* (甲), Six *Dīng* (丁), and Six *Fǔ* (府) deities dwell within the body,\nAnd when the body’s void is tranquil, one attains serene ease and comfort,\nOtherwise, sorrow and distress arise.\n\n**Cultivating the Pearl to Nourish the Spirit’s Root**\nThe Pearl is formed—\nSaliva gathered in succession like beads of jade.\nConserve the essence—\nDo not wastefully emit.\nThe Spirit’s Root is the physical form itself.\nAs the spirit relates to the body,\nSo the sovereign relates to the state and its people.\nThe people rely on the sovereign for life,\nThe sovereign relies on the people as foundation,\nMutually sustaining each other as the vital principle of existence and cultivation.\n\n**Jade Barriers and Golden Keys Ever Complete and Firm**\nAs *Lǎozǐ* (老子) says:\n*\"The adept at sealing is unopened even by the mightiest force.\"*\nKeys are the locks of sealing.\nSome say, *\"Smile\"* is also a key.\nBending the tongue to consume *tāijīn* (胎津),\nGuiding saliva to nourish the *tāixiān* (胎仙) embryo,\nHence called *tāijīn*—\nThis enables me to complete the refining and attain *fēixiān* (飞仙) transcendence.\nThe result of diligent practice and sincere devotion.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Immortal’s Way**\nThe Immortal’s Daoist path is not inherently divine—\nIt is attained through cultivation and study.\nAccumulating essence and amassing *qi* to forge the True.\n\n*\"With foundation, or without\"*—this phrase is omitted in the following.\n\n**The Yellow Boy’s Marvelous Sound is Hard to Hear**\nThe Yellow Boy (黄童), the Yellow Court Sage (黄庭真人), also called the Red City Boy (赤城童子),\nWhose marvelous sound refers to the Yellow Court Dao’s (黄庭道) exquisite resonance.\nThe *Jade Scripture with Crimson Slips* bears the text of the Red Elixir.\n\nThe *Yellow Court Scripture* (《黄庭经》), also called *The Golden Scripture of the Supreme Emperor* (《太帝金书》) or *The Jade Chapters of Bundled Splendor* (《束华玉篇》),\nHas the inscription: *\"True Person’s Perk\"* (真人巾) and *\"Golden Perk\"* (金巾).\nThe True Person is the Yellow Boy.\nGolden is white, located in the West, governing the lungs.\nThe lungs are white, residing above the heart, hence called *perk* (巾).\nThe *Nine True Scripture* (《九真经》) states:\nThe Green Sovereign wears robes of green jade brocade,\nA flying skirt of azure clouds,\nA crown of *Fúzhī* (扶芝) elixir,\nAnd a *perk* of golden white (金巾).\nAgain, the *Primordial Yang Sage* (元阳子) says:\nThe True Person leans upon *Wǔ* (午), the *Jū* (倨) child,\nSteps upon *Mǎo* (卯), wears *Yǒu* (酉).\n*Yǒu* is gold.\nCarrying armor and holding talismans to open the Seven Gates,\nThe *Lǎozǐ’s Six Jiǎ Threefold Talismans* (《老子六甲三部符》) say:\n*Jiǎzǐ* (甲子) deity—*Shénwáng* (神王) Wénqīng (文卿),\n*Jiǎxū* (甲戌) deity—*Shénchén* (神辰) Zǐjiāng (子江),\n*Jiǎshēn* (甲申) deity—*Shénhù* (神扈) Wéncháng (文长),\n*Jiǎwǔ* (甲午) deity—*Shénwèi* (神卫) Shàngqīng (上卿),\n*Jiǎchén* (甲辰) deity—*Shénmèng* (神孟) Fēiqīng (非卿),\n*Jiǎyín* (甲寅) deity—*Shénmíng* (神明) Wénzhāng (文章).\nPreserving the names of the Six *Jiǎ* deities,\nThe Seven Orifices open freely,\nDispelling all illnesses.\n\nThe talismans and diagrams of the Fire Soldiers guard the Spirit Gates.\nThe *Red Chapter* (《赤章》) and *Severing Heresy Scroll* (《斩邪录》)\nBoth command the Fire Soldiers of the Three Heavens and Five Phases.\nAgain, the *Spirit of the Luminous Guard Incantation* (《卫灵神咒》) says:\nThe Southern Red Heaven (南方丹天), where the Three *Xī* (熙) radiate light,\nThe *Yíngxīng* (荧星) revolve like torches,\nPiercingly illuminating the Great Sun (太阳);\nAbove, the *Chìjīng* (赤精) *Kāimíng* (开明) *Língtóng* (灵童) presides,\nCommanding the Fire Soldiers,\nGuarding the Three Officials (三官).\nThis refers to the Fire Soldiers of the Three Heavens and Five Phases.\n\nTalismans are those that display:\nThe Eight Pure Ones and Six Spirits,\nYang Essence and Jade Embryo,\nRefined Immortal Yin Essence,\nAscending *Fēijǐng* (飞景) Yellow Brilliance,\nInner Transformation of the Central Brilliance,\nPiercing Spirit to *Jiànqián* (鉴乾) inspect the Heavenly Stem.\n\nDiagrams include:\n*The Three Heavens and Five Phases Mixed Unity Diagram of the Supreme One* (《太一混合三五图》),\n*The Upper and Lower Yin-Yang Six Jiǎ Diagrams* (《六甲上下阴阳图》),\n*The Six Jiǎ Jade Maiden Communicating with Spirits Diagram* (《六甲玉女通灵图》),\n*The Supreme One True Person Diagram* (《太一真人图》),\n*The Bundled Well Bathing Diagram* (《束井沐浴图》),\n*The Inner Vision of Lǎozǐ Diagram* (《老子内视图》),\n*The Eight Histories of Western Ascension Diagram* (《西升八史图》),\n*The Nine Transformations Embracing the Brilliance Diagram* (《九变含景图》),\n*The Red Realm* (《赤界》), etc.,\nAll of which can guard and secure the Spirit Gates.\n\n**The Spirit Gates: Forefront Elevated, Hindmost Lowered, High and Low Displayed**\nThe arrangement of their stations.\nWielding a sword a hundred *zhàng* (丈) long, dancing with the Spirit Banner,\nThe form of the Spirit Soldiers’ banners and swords.\nThe Ten Absolute Ones hover in the void, brandishing swirling chaos,\nForming *qi* in the emptiness, majestic and resplendent.\nThe Fire Bells crown the celestial ranks, descending like mist,\nThe Golden Essence and Fire Bells,\nAscending to pierce the heavens.\nThe ranks and formations resemble the gathering of mist and clouds.\nWhere does one find the Yellow Gate between the brows?\nMeditating upon the Fire Soldiers’ *qi* and forms,\nAll reside in the *Tiāntíng* (天庭).\nThe *Tiāntíng* is also called the Yellow Gate (黄阙),\nBetween the brows it is.\nThis is not a superficial matter—\nIt is the root of Daoist cultivation.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Purple Clear Emperor’s Grand Dao**\nThe Purple Clear Emperor (紫清上皇), the Grand Daoist Sovereign (大道君),\nAlso known as the Jade Dawn Sovereign (玉晨君).\nThe titles *Tàixuán* (太玄) and *Tàihé* (太和)*,\nThe noble designations of the True Immortals.\nTransforming to generate all things, making me an Immortal—\nThe merit of Daoist *qi*.\nAscending in ten days to the Ten Heavens, riding the Jade Axis.\nSwiftly departing by the *qi* of sudden efficacy.\nDay and night, for seven days, meditate without sleep—\nSincerity will evoke the response.\nIf you can practice this, you may endure eternally,\nExtending years through the Immortal’s Dao.\nAccumulating merit to complete the refining is not innate—\nThe Way is achieved through cultivation.\nThis stems from sincerity and also from focus,\nGuarding the One as at the beginning,\nLeaving ample attainment of the Dao.\nInternally guarding the firm and true—\nNot losing the rhythm of discipline.\n\nThe Void within, serene and undisturbed, naturally attains the Spirit.\nThe Spirit receives through the Void.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The Hundred Grains**\nThe fruits of the hundred grains are the essence of the land.\nGrass fruits are called grains; they belong to the category of *yin*.\nThe five flavors, though externally alluring, are the temptations of demons and foulness—\nNot the pure *qi* of the True Way.\nRank odors disrupt the clarity of the Spirit and dissipate the *tàiqì* (胎气).\nThe *tàiqì* refers to the flavor of no-flavor, the natural *zhèngqì* (正气).\nThere are methods of *shòuqì* (服气) that cultivate the *tàixī* (胎息).\nDissipate means to lose.\n\nHow then can one reverse aging and return to infancy?\nIt is not by making the hair turn from white to black or regrowing fallen teeth.\nThis line should follow *Zìcún Shén* (自存神), for what follows is of a different kind.\n\nThe Three Souls (*sānhún*) flutter in agitation, the Corporeal Soul (*pò*) decays and crumbles!\nFluttering means not maintaining serenity.\nDecay and crumble mean ruin and decline.\n\nWhy not nourish yourself with the *Tàihé* (太和) essence and *qi*?\nAdvancing the method of refining and ingestion.\nThus, one may attain immortality and enter *Huángníng* (黄宁).\n*Huángníng* is the fulfillment of the *Huángtíng* (黄庭) Dao.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: The Heart Canon**\nThe Heart Canon—one body, five viscera as sovereigns.\nThe Spirit receives through the Void; the Heart is the pivot of the Spirit’s dwelling, hence its sovereignty.\nThe moral *Dao* of movement and stillness lies in contemplation.\nThis refers to contemplating the *Dānyuán Tóngzǐ* (丹元童子).\nThought is existence; forgetfulness is non-existence.\nThought stirs the Heart before speech, while forgetfulness extinguishes the Heart and preserves the Spirit—thus the moral *Dao* is realized.\nPure and virtuous *qi* naturally radiates clarity.\nThis arises from constant contemplation.\nWhether seated or rising, we are all pillars of the same structure—\nThe body is the Spirit’s dwelling, hence the saying of shared pillars.\n*Wú* (吾) refers to the *Dānyuán Zǐ* (丹元子).\nBy day, the sun’s brilliance; at dusk, concealment and retreat.\nAs *Zhuāngzi* says: When awake, the form expands; when asleep, the Souls converge.\nConverge means to close.\n\nHarmonizing the *huá jīng* (华精) smooths *yin* and *yang*.\nThis refers to the Heart’s Spirit gathering with the moon’s correspondence.\n*Huá jīng* is the essence of the eyes.\nWhen the Heart opens, the eyes open; when the Heart closes, the eyes close.\nDay is *yang*, evening is *yin*—thus *yin* and *yang* are harmonized.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Circulation of the Six Extremes**\nCirculating through the Six Extremes—concealing at *mǎo* (卯), emerging at *yǒu* (酉).\nThe use of the Heart’s gathering governs *yin* and *yang*.\nDay is circulation; dusk is concealment.\nThe Six Extremes are the heavens and earth, the four directions within.\n*Yǒu* belongs to the north, the realm of concealment and darkness.\nThe two Kidneys’ Spirits govern longevity.\nThe Kidney Spirit is *Xuánmíng* (玄冥), with the epithet *Yùyīng* (育婴).\nAssociated with the north, it governs night—if one can preserve *jīng* (精), longevity follows.\n*Héshànggōng* (河上公) says: The Kidneys store *jīng*.\nDescending to *Dǒu* (斗), aligning with the initial *jiǔ* (九).\nNine is the *yang* number.\n*Dǒu* is the North Star, which governs *yin*—this is the *yang* descending to unite with *yin*.\nThe *Yì* says: *Bu* (乾, Heaven) attains *jī* (吉, auspiciousness) through concealment.\nConcealment is the meaning of *jiǔ*.\nKnowing the male and guarding the female prevents aging.\nGuarding the female means adhering to the principle of *jiǔ*.\nSeeing white and knowing black—urgently sit and guard.\nAs *Lǎozǐ* says: Know the male, guard the female; know the white, guard the black.\nAll are the meaning of *jiǔ*.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Liver’s Qi**\nThe Liver’s *qi* is suppressed yet surging, clear and enduring.\nThe Liver occupies the east, the realm of wood, the origin of vital *qi*.\nClear and enduring are the manifestations of its *qi*.\nArranged in the Six Palaces, it generates the Three Lights.\nVisualizing vital *qi* illuminates the five viscera and six bowels,\nLike the radiance of the sun, moon, and stars.\nWith focused intent, the inner Spirit remains unshaken—\nThis is the power of the One.\nAbove, it unites with the Three Burners; below, it becomes the Jade Nectar.\nThe Liver’s *qi* ascending unites with the Three Burners’ *qi*; descending, it becomes the saliva in the mouth.\nJust as *yin* ascending becomes clouds, descending becomes rain,\nRain nourishes all things; the Jade Nectar nourishes the hundred bones and nine orifices.\nThe Mysterious Fluid (*Xuányè*) flows, dispelling foul odors and emitting fragrance.\nTrue *qi* circulating eliminates disease.\nIt cleanses the teeth, refines the five viscera.\nClouds move, rain descends—nothing is blocked.\nThe five viscera are refined.\nDrawing the *jīn* (津) from the *Xuán yīng* (玄膺) into the *Míngtáng* (明堂),\nThe method of swallowing saliva descends from the *Xuán yīng* to the throat.\nThe throat is also called *Chónglóu* (重楼).\nBelow *Chónglóu* is the *Míngtáng*; below *Míngtáng* is the *Dòngfáng* (洞房); below *Dòngfáng* is the *Dāntián*.\nThis is the middle region.\nDescending to irrigate the throat, the Spirit becomes luminous.\nLife depends on *jīnqì* (津气).\n\nSeated beneath the *Huágài* (华盖), wandering the *Guìjīng* (贵京),\n*Huágài* is the Lung; the Liver lies beneath it.\n*Guìjīng* is the *Dāntián*.\nFloating and dancing upon the Three Emperors’ platform, pure and cold,\nThe Three Emperors are the *Sāndān* (三丹)—the Daoist Lords of the *Dāntián*, also called True Persons.\nThe Liver’s *qi* drifts, circulating through the Three *Dāntián*.\nThe Liver’s *qi* is the essence of the eyes, hence the cold, clear platform.\nFive-colored clouds swirl in verdant splendor.\nThe Liver’s *qi* mingles with the five viscera, ascending as five-colored clouds.\nClosing the eyes, internally gazing—self-reflection reveals them.\nCommand the Heart’s Spirits to return and mutually revere one another.\nThe *Chéngchéng Tóngzǐ* (赤城童子) and the five viscera’s True Persons merge in harmony and mutual respect.\nThe Seven Mysterious Flowers bloom, opening the *Mìngmén* (命门).\nThe seven orifices flow freely, with no obstruction.\nHarmonizing the Heavenly Way preserves the Mysterious Root.\nThe body is the foundation of life.\nEven at one hundred and twenty years, one may still return.\nHurry to cultivate—time must not be wasted.\nBeyond this, guarding the Dao in sincerity becomes truly difficult.\nDeath draws near.\nOnly await the *Jiǔ Zhuàn Bā Qiōng Dān* (九转八琼丹),\nThe Nine-Turned Elixir of Eight Precious Stones—white, ascending to Heaven by day.\nAs *Bàopúzǐ* says in *Jiǔ Dān Lùn* (九丹论):\n*\"Examining the books on nurturing life and collecting methods for longevity,\nI have perused thousands of volumes, yet all emphasize the elixir of gold and liquid as the essence.\nAgain, the *Huángdì Jiǔ Dǐng Shéndān Jīng* (黄帝九鼎神丹经) states:\nThe Emperor took it and ascended to immortality, aligning with Heaven and Earth,\nRiding clouds and dragons, entering and exiting *Tàiqīng* (太清).\"*\nThe Eight Precious Stones are cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, malachite, sulfur, mica, saltpeter, and salt.\n\nTo restore vitality, one must carefully cultivate the Seven Elements—\nEven with elixirs of divine potency, one must also practice the *Huángtíng* Dao.\n\nThe Seven Elements refer to the seven stars and the true spirits of the seven orifices.\nMoreover, the Five Sovereigns’ Elemental Lords and the White Elemental Lord, the Elemental Lord of Splendor, are also the Seven Elemental Dao Lords.\n\n*The Dòngfáng Mèi* states:\n*\"To cultivate the Seven Elements, the incantation is:\n*'Return the Elements to concealment, dispel the seven luminaries.'*\nThis is the Seven Elements.\"*\n\nThe radiance of the sun and moon rescues aging decay—\nThe left eye governs the sun, the right eye governs the moon.\nThe eyes govern the liver, corresponding to the east’s wood phase.\nWood belongs to spring, spring is the breath of life—thus it rescues aging decay.\nThe liver’s *qi* circulates endlessly without cessation.\n\nAs *Zhuāngzǐ* says:\n*\"When the finger’s fire burns out, the flame passes to the kindling—\nLife endures through nourishment, and thus the breath continues.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four on the Lungs**\nThe lungs’ *qi* originates from the Triple Burner.\n*The Zhōnghuáng Jīng* states:\n*\"The lungs’ apex governs the Triple Burner.\"*\nThe lungs’ *qi* refers to *qìsòu* (气嗽), which arises from the Triple Burner—\nThus it is said the Triple Burner gives rise to it.\n\nMany explanations of the Triple Burner lack precision;\nNow it is understood as the five viscera’s upper conduits.\n\n*\"Jiao\"* means heat—\nSpeaking of the liver, heart, and lungs’ apexes, it conveys the sense of scorching heat.\n\nTo perceive the unseen, listen to the child within—\nThe child is the heart-spirit, the one in *Chìchéng* (赤城).\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four on the Lungs** (continued)\n\n**Elemental Yangzi** says:\n*\"Observe the separation and preserve the child within—\nThe child is the *mùtóng* (目童, 'eyeball child').*\nTo know of life and death,\none must press the hand’s fingers against the eye’s outer corner—\nwait for its glow.\nIf light appears, life remains;\nif no light, death is near.*\n\n*Nurture the five *huá* (华, *qi of the viscera*) to let essence flourish in the teeth,*\n*The Five Huá* are the *qi* of the five viscera.\n*The Immortal Scriptures* say:\n*\"Hair should be combed often,\nteeth should be struck often.\"*\n\n*Thirty-six gulps of saliva into the Jade Pool,*\n*The mouth is the Jade Pool, also called the Huá Pool (华池).*\n*The gallbladder is the Central Pool.*\n*The uterus is the Jade Spring (玉泉).*\n*The Huá Pool’s saliva descends into the Elixir Field,*\n*thus watering the sacred root.*\n\n*Begin by unblocking the hundred vessels of blood and vital fluids.*\n*The body’s blood and vital fluids originate from the mouth as their source.*\n\n*Complexion radiates with golden, jade-like luster—\nall joints unblocked.*\n*Teeth remain firm, hair black as if unaware of whitening,*\n*reverting to youth from old age.*\n*Preserve this true spirit without letting it scatter,*\n*concentrate sincerity and it will not fall.*\n*Remember this palace has its seat and resting place,*\n*This palace refers to the Lung Organ.*\n*The seat and resting place are where the spirit dwells.*\n*The Zhōnghuáng Jīng* states:\n*\"The lungs’ apex governs the Triple Burner,\nwhere the Lord of Mysterious Age (玄老君) resides.\"*\n\n*The myriad spirits gather and transform, seeking one another,*\n*The myriad true essences converge,\nyet fear the intrusion of malevolent *qì*.\"*\n\n「Begin with the hidden *羽盖* [feathered canopy] gazing upon the celestial abode—\nthis illuminates the affairs of the **Spleen Organ**.\n\nThe Spleen is the **Dan Tian** [Elixir Field] and **Huang Ting** [Yellow Court],\nthe central **Wù-Jǐ** [pentagon hexagram],\nthe realm of Earth’s cycle.\nAbove, it oversees the Liver and Lungs,\nlike a canopy and dwelling.\n\nMorning reverence to the **Tai Yang** [Great Yang] Lord, joyously summoning the spirits—\nthis refers to the **hun** [ethereal soul] and spirits gathering with the myriad Daoists.\nThe *Sù Líng Jīng* [Scripture of the Primordial Soul] states:\n*\"The Supreme Daoists possess the Tai Yang Lord, Shao Yang Lord, Tai Xu Lord, and Hao Su Lord—\nthe myriad sages follow the Dao’s joyous harmony.\"*\n\nThe **Ming Shen** [Illuminated Spirit] employs the **Eight Threats** to repel malevolence,\nthe **Eight Threats** being the Eight **Ling Shen** [Spiritual Essences].\nThe *Zhēn Yǔ* [True Speech] states:\n*\"The Northern Emperor’s Ghost-Slaying Incantation reads:\nSeven Rectitudes, Eight Spirits, Supreme Celestial, Radiant and Malevolent, Long Lu, and the Great Numbers—\nhandling the Emperor’s Bell, the Primordial *Sù* [unrefined essence],

while preserving the **male**, tilting toward the **Three Lights** [Sun, Moon, and Stars]—\nthe Spleen’s spirit is named **Cháng Zài** [Constant Presence],\nits character **Hun Tíng** [Soul’s Rest].\nThe Spleen grinds and dissolves food,\nwhile the Stomach, as the *Lǎo Zǐ* [Old Master] says:\n*\"Know its male, guard its female.\nThe female pertains to household matters.\"*\nThe *Zhōnghuáng Jīng* [Scripture of the Central Yellow] states:\n*\"The Stomach is the Great Female;\nit is soft and yielding.\"*\nThe **Three Lights** are Sun, Moon, and Stars.\n\nThe **Tai Cāng** [Great Granary]—\nthe Spleen’s **府** [storehouse]—\nhas the **external square and internal round** [form], with spirit dwelling within.\nNurture the **Ling Gēn** [Spiritual Root] without letting it wither—\nthe **external square and internal round** are the symbols of the **Ming Tang** [Illuminated Hall].\nThe Spleen is the **Huang Ting** [Yellow Court],\nthe foundation of human life.\nIf the **Heart** concentrates in nourishing it,\nthe blood vessels will flow unimpeded,\nthe Five **Zàng** [solid organs] will flourish,\nand longevity as a Daoist Immortal will be attained.\n\nSeal the **Ming Men** [Life Gate], preserving the **Yu Du** [Jade Metropolis]—\nthe **Yuan Yang Zi** [Primordial Yang Master] says:\n*\"The Ming Men is the lower Dan Tian,\nwhere refined essence and qi enter the spirit.\"*\nNurture the **Tóng** [child] below, protecting its master—\nthe **master** refers to the **body**.」\n\nThe body is the **Jade Metropolis**, where the spirit gathers—\nlike a capital city.\nThe myriad spirits reward longevity with abundance,\nfor the myriad spirits repay with nourishment—\nthus, life is prolonged.\n\nThis is called the **Spleen established in the Central Palace**.\nThe Spleen, as **Middle Official** [#11], embodies **Earth virtue**.\nThe Five **Zàng** [solid organs] and Six **Fǔ** [hollow organs], divine and sovereign,\ntake the Spleen as their master.\n\nAbove, it aligns with the **Heavenly Gate** to enter the **Ming Tang** [Illuminated Hall],\npreserving the **qi** of the Five **Zàng** and Six **Fǔ**—\nthe **Heavenly Gate** lies between the brows, that is, the **Heavenly Court**.\nOne inch inward from the **brow junction** is the **Ming Tang**.\n\nGuard the **feminine**, preserve the **masculine**, and incline the **Three Lights** [Sun, Moon, Stars].\nAs *Laozi* says: *\"Know the masculine, guard the feminine.\"*\n**Feminine**—the **vulnerable** [yīn];\n**gently yielding** also.\nThe **Three Lights**—the Sun, Moon, and Stars.\n**External square and internal round**, with spirit dwelling within.\n**External square and internal round**—the symbols of the **Ming Tang**.\nUnimpeded flow of blood vessels and flourishing of the Five **Zàng**,\nwith spirit serene and heart tranquil.\n\nBones turn **verdant**, sinews **crimson**, marrow like frost—\nthe **hundred vessels** and **nine orifices** are all truly

**yáng** in order.\nThe Sun is **yáng**, the Moon is **yīn**—\nthe Sun is male, the Moon is female.\nThe two spirits unite, transforming into **Jade Nectar**—\nmale and female **yīn-yáng**, the natural **essence-fluid**.\n\nFaint and flavorless, the root of **Heaven and Man**,\nthough spirits unite, one must savor the **flavorless**.\n\nThe **True Person of the Child Dan** advances **refined qi**—\n**Child Dan**—the **True Person** advances the **true qi** of the **Dan Tian**.\nThe Spleen, as **Central Yellow**, grinds and digests food.\nThus, it is called **Ling Gāo** [Luminous Paste] and **Yù Shuāng** [Jade Frost]—\nthe colors of **essence-fluid** and refined **qi**.\n\nThe **Taoist Sovereign** conceals the **Eight Pure** [substances] in the **Encircled Pearl**—\nreferring to the

**essence**.\n\nHidden in the **Great Yīn** [Chamber of Mystery], I behold its form—\n**Great Yīn**, the **Cavern Chamber**—\nwitnessing the form of the **Jade Fluids**.\n\nThe **Wind of Exaltation** stirs the **Three Mysteries**, emerging as **Emerald**.\n**Emerald Wind**—transformed by sensation.\n**Yīn** and **yáng** **qi**, along with the **Harmonious Qi**, make three—\nthree gives birth to the myriad things, the subtle origin of life—\nthus, it is said the **Three Mysteries** emerge as **Emerald**.\nSpeaking of all things born in **verdant** hue.\n\n*The Taiping Jing* says: *\"Accumulating essence yields verdancy.\"*\n\nIn a fleeting moment, it reaches **purity and clarity**—\nthe **yīn-yáng** vital breath, most subtle and wondrous.\n\nAt the **Playground Terrace**, I

are the **Inner Chí**, hence \"Eluding Chí.\"\n**Clouded Lingying**—the **Spleen’s** **Jīn-yè** fluids.\nThey can satiate hunger, commanding all spirits.\n\nAbove, the **Mysterious-Mysterious** canopy; below, the **Tiger Seal**,\nThe **apparel of immortals**.\n*The Yuanlu Scripture* says: Immortals have the **Mysterious Feathered Umbrella** and the **Divine Tiger Jade

meat.\n**Pungent**—the five **spicy** aromas.\n\nEntering the chamber, binding oneself toward reciting the **Jade Texts**,\nFor the **Supreme Emperor** resides in the East.\n\nStrictly observing ten thousand repetitions, its meaning becomes fresh—\nWithout leaving the body.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six (continued): Bathing in Ritual Purity**\n\n**Loosening the Hair Without Desire for Longevity**\nLoosening the hair, free of **desire**, to prolong existence.\n*The Scripture of the Immortals* states: \"Before taking the **Nine Clouds of the Lingying Bell***, one must loose the hair.\"\n\nAgain, the **Fetal Breathing Method** instructs:\nLie on your back, loosen the hair, and raise your pillow two and a half inches.\nCurl both hands, gripping the **Great Mother Finger** (thumb) firmly,\nClose your eyes, extend both arms five inches from the body,\nThen **gargle** and fill your mouth.\nHold the **Middle Saliva** (saliva collected in the mouth) and swallow it three times.\nSlowly draw in **qi** through the nose,\nInhale **five to six breaths** before exhaling.\nOne exhalation and one inhalation constitute one **breath**.\nWhen you reach ten exhalations, you may reduce the frequency.\nUpon completion, repeat the process.\nFilling four times nine (36 times) marks one **session** complete.\n\nUpon examining the text’s meaning,\nThis \"loosening the hair\" is not exclusive to this **Dao** alone.\nIt embodies the **Way** of **wuwei** (non-action), attaining effortless **virtue** through naturalness—\nFree from external **emotional desires**.\n\nAll five **flavors** return to **Zheng-qi** (pure/true **qi**), merging into one.\nThis is the **Dao** of nature.\n\nCalm the **heart**, still the **mind**—do not disturb the **Yuan** (source).\n**Question**—serenity.\nSilent and tranquil stillness.\n*The Dao Scripture* says: \"Its governance is **questioning**, its people are **pure**.\"\n\nHaving counted the repetitions, the **body’s** **shen** (spirit) and **jing** (essence) are refined,\nFocusing the **jing** where it is directed.\n\nThe Yellow Flowered Jade Maiden reveals the **Zi’s** (child’s) **emotion**,\nThe **Dan-tian** (Elixir Field) **yin** (dark) **shen** (spirit) speaks to oneself.\n\nWhen the **Zhen-ren** (True Person) arrives, he summons the Six **Ding** (heavenly officials),\nThe **Zhen-ren** refers to the scholar’s **body**.\n**Arrival** means **jing** (essence) has reached its peak.\nThe Six **Ding** are as previously described.\n\nThen he imparts the *Great Scripture of the Hidden Immortality*—\nThe **Hidden Immortality** refers to the recluse.\nHe likens the **sage** to the **Zhi-ying** (herb/plant’s flower).\n\nAfter ten recitations and four bows to the **Taoist Sovereign**,\nThe *Jade Essence True Scripture* states:\n*\"The Eastern Jade Scripture\"* is to be read aloud ten times and bowed to four times.\nThe **Jade Scripture** refers to this text.\n\nFirst, one pays homage to the **Taoist Emperor**,\nThen faces north—\nThe **Taoist Emperor** resides in the **Shu** (constellation), and the **Seven Yuan** (primordial stars) dwell in the north.\n\nThe *Yellow Court Inner Scripture* and **Jade Book** are now freely expounded.\nThe **Dao** of the **sage** is thus perfected.\n\nThe instructor’s words are solemn, the recipient’s oath is binding—\nThis text must be revered, hence the vow.\n*\"Cloud brocade, phoenix-patterned robes, and golden clasps\"* are tokens of faith,\nUsed in place of cutting the hair or drawing blood to pledge sincerity.\n\nWith clasped hands, ascending the mountain to oppose the **Ye** (darkness) **liquid** (elixir),\nOne who receives and practices the **Yellow Court Dao** must renew the oath before instruction.\n\nOnly then may the **Golden Book** and **Jade Scripture** be revealed.\nTrust is established before transmission.\n\nUpon attaining it, one may pass it to the **Three Officials**—\nThe **Three Officials**, namely Heaven, Earth, and Water.\nBut let not the **Seven Ancestors** suffer **Ming** (dark/obscure) **hui** (calamity),\nFor transmission to the unworthy brings misfortune upon one’s forebears.\n\n**息**—read as *huan* (return/restore).\nThe **Supreme Dao’s** subtle words lead to immortality—\nWorthy of reverence, worthy of esteem.\nThis is the true text of the **Way of Non-Death**.\n\nWith a single heart, hold it in respect and practice accordingly.\n\n---\n**Yellow Court Inner Vision Jade Scripture (Volume 2, lower scroll) #3**\n*(Original: \"二\" [two]; corrected

Reciting it harmonizes the Six Palaces (六府), calms the mind and spirit, and grants immortality.\n\nIt is also called the *Dadi Jin Shu* (大帝金书), the sacred scripture recited in the palace of the Great Emperor of Fuxiang (扶桑大帝君), inscribed on golden tablets—hence *\"Jin Hui\"* (金会).\n\nIt is also called the *Shuhua Yupan* (束华玉篇). Donghua (东华) refers to the palaces of the Eastern realm, where the Qingtongjun (青童君) of the Eastern Sea resides. The immortal maidens and sages there recite and practice it, inscribing it on jade—thus *\"Yupan\"* (玉篇).\n\nOne must observe strict purity for ninety days, reciting the text ten thousand times, to harmonize the Three Souls (三魂), refine the Seven Spirits (七魄), eliminate the Three Corpses (三尸), and balance the Six Palaces (六府). The Five Viscera (五藏) will flourish with vitality, the complexion will revert to youth, and no ailment or calamity shall harm the body. Upon completion, one will naturally perceive the spirits of ghosts and gods, internally observe the intestines and stomach, and behold the Five Viscera.\n\nAt this time, the Yellow Court True Person (黄庭真人) and the Jade Maiden of Shuhua (束华玉女) will appear to instruct the adept. This is the Way of Immortality. If you possess the marks of the Dao, you have obtained this sacred text.\n\nThis scripture maps the divine chambers of the body’s singular form—the abode of the embryonic spirit (胎神). Those who recite it constantly will illuminate the divine chambers, secure the embryonic spirit, circulate the celestial fluids (灵液), harmonize the hundred passages (百关), fill the blood and marrow, balance the intestines and stomach, and cause the Five Viscera to bloom with vitality. Hearing and sight will sharpen, gray hair will darken, and decayed teeth will regrow.\n\nThus, it repels the chaotic onset of illness, for one has mastered the six arrays of soul and essence (魂精六纬). With the body filled and the spirit at ease, death becomes unattainable—hence the name *Neijing Huangting* (内景黄庭).\n\nThe recipient must observe purity for nine days, seven days, or three days before receiving the text. The instructor is the teacher; the recipient must revere them.",

      "translated_text": "「To form a pact and take an oath, one must pledge not to divulge it. In ancient times, oaths were sealed with a black cloud brocade of ninety *chi* in length, a golden tablet with phoenix script wrapped in a silk cloth of forty *chi*, and nine pairs of golden buttons—these replaced the solemn vow of cutting hair and drawing enemy blood without betrayal. Such materials were sacred fabrics from the divine realm (*shénxiāng*), not common goods of the mortal world (*chìxiàn*).\n\nNow, the brocade may be substituted with white gauze (*báishāng*), the silk cloth with blue cloth (*qīngbù*), and the buttons with gold-plated ones (*jīnduàn*), which are still sufficient to bind the oath to the Nine Heavens and to admonish the Three Officials. All must revere the teacher who possesses the scripture; if the oath is broken, the Seven Ancestors will be summoned to the *Tānggǔ* River’s source for judgment, and one’s body will be tormented by the *Fēngdāo* (Wind Blade) as a ghost.\n\nThe *Tānggǔ* is the oral transmission of the Middle Mountain King. One who receives the scripture may pass it on to nine others. They must carefully examine the recipient’s *form* and *qi*—only those who are benevolent, loyal, and sincere, and who dwell in Dao/Way and embody truth (*zhuànxuán zhùzhēn*), may be taught without corrupting the true transmission. They should respect and delight in the Immortal Way. Only then may they be entrusted with it. If they lack such virtue, it is a risk of leakage; thus, selecting a worthy recipient is both prudent and difficult.\n\nMoreover, one should first seek signs of resonance and verify the recipient’s purity and subtlety (*xūlíng*) before transmission. When the recipient is deemed worthy, the teacher may also reveal it through dreams, and the timing of the transmission will be intuitively understood.\n\nThe penalties for divulgence are severe; those who pass it on must be cautious indeed—how could one with the *Neijing Huangting* scripture not be vigilant?\n\nThe *Qīngxū Zhēnkǒu Mìjìng* (Oral Transmission of the Pure and Empty Immortal) states: The *Neijing Huangting* scripture is the golden text of the Great Emperor of the *Dàsāng* (Morning Sun), a secret teaching for refining the True Self (*liànzhēn*). Those who read the *Neijing Huangting Jing* should do so in a secluded chamber, burning incense and purifying their vessels (*jìngshèng*), before taking up the text. All who possess this scripture are protected from a hundred evils (*bǎi xié*).\n\nIf one enters mountains, forests, or shadowy places and feels shaken with dread, they should steady their mind, face north, and recite the *Neijing Jing* once. Their spirit will then quiet, and their intent will level—even as if journeying with a thousand others, the fear will cease. If one recites it ten thousand times (*wàn guò*), they will personally perceive the Five Viscera, intestines, and stomach, as well as all ghosts and spirits of the world, subject to their command.\n\nFor those afflicted with illness, if they hold the text in mind, even at the brink of death, they will be cured. Generally, one must avoid consuming the Six Livestock (*liùchù*), violent fish (*yúzào*), the Five Pungent herbs (*wǔxīn*), and acts of covering filth (*yǎnwū*). If one has stepped barefoot (*tuōlǚ*), they must bathe, rinse their mouth, burn incense on either side, and recite the scripture once—all maladies will then be dispelled.\n\nThe words of the Small Lord (*Xiǎojūn*) say: Before retiring at night, one should first recite the *Huangting Jing* once, then sleep. This allows the soul and spirit (*húnpò*) to self-regulate and refine, achieving three or four recitations (*guò*) being ideal.\n\nThe myriad teachings (*wànfǎ*) depend on humanity as their foundation, and humanity relies on the heart as its core. Without humanity, teachings cannot arise; without the heart, the body cannot stand. The heart’s teachings are many, and their application varies; they encompass both existence and nonexistence (*yǒuwú èr tǐ*), responding to circumstances and seizing opportunities.\n\nThus, there are distinctions between the mundane and the sage, shallow and profound, foolish and wise, true and false—none differ without the discernment of heart and spirit, nor without their proper application. Yet, all teachings of the world, though their paths vary, converge in their destination; all thoughts, though diverse, align in their purpose. From coarse to refined, from expedient to absolute, there are two stages; from falsehood to truth, from error to clarity, they ultimately harmonize in one vision.\n\nThose who hold the *Neijing Huangting Jing* are the guardians of the sacred Dao/Way (*shùhuá*). It is indeed the essential secret for learning the Immortal Way and the foundation for achieving *yùhuà* (transformation into a feathered immortal). Though my practice is still incomplete, my contemplation is coarse, I have yet glimpsed the myriad subtle essences and modeled a singular form.\n\nThere are four doctrines (*sì zōng*), and seven key characters (*qìzì*) to grasp; they point to phenomena and elucidate meanings, speaking of both inner and outer realms (*nèiwài liǎng yán*). In the midst of sharp hearing and angry body, during moments of inhaling and exhaling through the throat, or when licking the brush and grinding ink, I will often leave behind the original divinations (*yuánshuài*).»",

      "translated_text": "The Yellow is the color of the central realm. The *Tíng* is the center of the four directions. Externally, it points to affairs: the celestial center, the human center, and the terrestrial center. Internally, it points to affairs: the center of the brain, the center of the heart, and the center of the spleen. Hence, it is called *Huángtíng*.\n\nThe Inner is the heart. The *Jǐng* is the form. Externally, the form refers to the phenomena of the sun, moon, stars, clouds, and mists. Internally, the form refers to the phenomena of blood, flesh, sinews, bones, and the viscera. The heart resides within the body, preserving the unity of form and color in observation, hence it is called *Nèijǐng* (Inner Form).\n\n**Chapter One of the Upper Clarity (Shàngqīng Zhāng)**\n\nBefore the *Zǐxué Xūhuáng* (Purple Vapor Emperor) of the Upper Clarity, within the realm of the *Sānqīng* (Three Clarities)—comprising *Yùqīng* (Jade Clarity), *Shàngqīng* (Upper Clarity), and *Tàiqīng* (Supreme Clarity)—this is where all the great sages dwell. According to the *Yùwéi Jīng* (Jade Canopy Scripture), the Upper Clarity is governed by the *Xūhuáng Dàdào Jūn* (Emperor of the Great Dao of the Purple Vapor), the domain of the Great Dao that encompasses the Three Clarities. He also presides over the daily rituals in the southwest direction, where the *Tàilíng Xūhuáng Tiānzūn* (Supreme Numinous Purple Vapor Celestial Venerable), known as the original title of *Yuánshǐ* (Primordial Beginning), resides.\n\nThe Dao Emperor wished to clarify the seven-word incantation (*qìzì*), thus beginning with the *Zǐxué guān* (Purple Vapor Office), also called the *Zǐqióng guān* (Purple Crystal Office) or the *Zǐchén guān* (Purple Dawn Office). The *Tàishàng Dàdào Yùchén Jūn* (Jade Dawn Lord of the Supreme Dao) is another title for the Supreme Venerable. According to the *Běnxíng Jīng* (Scripture of Original Conduct), this is also the title of the five senior lords of *Yuánshǐ* (Primordial Beginning). The Jade Dawn Lord is one of the titles for the *Huánglǎo* (Imperial Old One).\n\nIn leisure, the Dao Emperor resides within the *Yàozhū* (Pill Palace) and delivers the seven-word incantation. The *Bìyào Jīng* (Secret Essentials Scripture) states: Within the immortal court, there is the *Liáoyáng* (Luminous Yang) Hall, the *Yàozhū* (Pill Palace) Gate, and the Seven Reflections Chamber. The Dao Emperor dwells within and teaches the scripture. The human body possesses all these.\n\n**Dispersing and Transforming Five Forms to Change Myriad Gods**\nThis refers to gathering the limbs, abandoning sharpness and clarity, departing from form and discarding wisdom, aligning with the Great Unity, and progressing from the original to the refined—hence, assuming the guise of gods to manifest their applications.\n\nThe gods are those that respond to sensation, thus their number is manifold—how could it be limited to myriad? This is the *Huángtíng Rìnèi Piān* (Yellow Court Inner Form Scripture), deriving its name from the central realm.\n\n**Plucking the Heart in Three Layers, Dancing the Embryo to Achieve the Sage**\nPlucking (*qín*) is harmony; layers (*dié*) are accumulation. Preserving the three *dāntián* (elixir fields), making them harmonize and accumulate as one, allows the embryo sage (*tāixiān*) to be attained.\n\nThe embryo sage (*tāixiān*) is the sage of embryonic breathing (*tāixī*), akin to the embryo in the womb having breath but no respiration.\n\n**Nine Qi Manifesting and Illuminating, Emerging from the Celestial Questions**\nWithin the three elixir fields, there are nine radiant *qì* (vital energies). None are without illumination. The *Dàdòng Jīng* (Great Cavern Scripture) states: The three elixir fields, combined with the three *yuán* (primordial essences) and the three *dòngfáng* (cavern chambers), total nine offices (*guān*). Within these offices, the celestial sovereign’s nine *pò* (souls) transform into the nine *yángmò* (yang paths) and become the nine *qì* (vital energies), which further manifest as the nine gods (*shén*).\n\n**The Godly Essence Appears as a Child, Generating Purple Mist**\nThrough observation and contemplation, the mind assumes the task, borrowing the eyes to perceive.",
