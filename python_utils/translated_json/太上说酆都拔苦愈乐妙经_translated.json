The compiler is unknown, though it likely emerged between the Tang and Song dynasties. It purports to record the scripture preached by the Heavenly Worthy of Deliverance from Suffering and Attainment of Bliss for the salvation of all beings.

Within the thirty-eight thousand hells and twenty-seven thousand dark prisons of Fengdu, he beheld boundless suffering beings—ascending and descending the mountains of knives, turning ten thousand times and circling a thousand, fainting in despair and wailing in grief. All plunged into cauldrons of searing coals and boiling broth, endlessly revolving in the wheel of rebirth, ceaseless day and night, dying ten thousand deaths without respite.\n\nThus, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by boundless compassion, took pity on all beings and expounded for them *The Wondrous Sutra of Universal Salvation in Fengdu*. By its power, the destitute souls burdened with sins shall attain rebirth in the Vermilion Mound, ascend to the immortal realms, and be transformed into celestial beings. May the mountains of knives become jeweled thrones, the forests of swords blossom into flowering groves. May the Six Paths and Three Wretched Realms dissolve into ashes, and all boundless grave offenses be reduced to dust. Across kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, may the imperial grace grant absolution. Turn your hearts to the true Dao, and ascend in ethereal splendor to the Purple Tenuity.\n\n**Here ends *The Supreme Venerable Sovereign’s Sutra of Deliverance from Suffering and Attainment of Bliss in Fengdu*.**",
