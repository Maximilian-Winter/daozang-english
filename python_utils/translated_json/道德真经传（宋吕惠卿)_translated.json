  "full_translation": "**Preface to the *Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***\n\nYour subject Huiqing respectfully states: I have heard that when Cook Ding presented his blade, he attained the art of nurturing life before Lord Wenhui; when Wheelwright Bian laid down his chisel, he debated the reading of books before Duke Huan of Qi. If one’s aspiration remains undivided, the Dao may yet be found.\n\nWith utmost reverence and trepidation, I bow my head again and again.\n\nI humbly observe that the great system has scattered amid the falsity of cleverness, and all living beings have lost their original nature and emotions. Thus arose the True Person, who illuminated the supreme teaching, tracing its origin solely to the Dao and its virtue, and venerating the ancient canons. Hence, when Zhuang Zhou spoke of the age when \"chickens and dogs could be heard\" in one another’s villages, he referred to the time of Shennong and before; when the *Classic of Master Lie* declared the \"Valley Spirit never dies,\" it attributed the work to the Yellow Emperor. Probing its subtle words, one finds wondrous things within. Vague and indistinct, they elude sight and hearing; neither ancient nor modern, their beginning and end defy comprehension. To lose them is to drift ever farther, like the supreme treasure hidden on Mount Ke, unknown to all; to grasp them is to have them come unbidden, like the Dark Pearl sought through *Xiangwang* and thus obtained.\n\nThe land of Huaxu visited by the Yellow Emperor, the Mount Gushe of Tang Yao—both mark the utmost journeys, leading to perfect tranquility. The intent of this book differs not from such attainments. When Cao Can studied under Master Gai and governed Qi, when Emperor Wen of Han transmitted the teachings of the *Heshang* and founded his dynasty, they grasped but the surface, yet still approached peace and prosperity.\n\nAlas, vulgar learning fails to recognize the truth of the Dao. It sees only that the text differs from the traces of the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, unaware that its meaning is the very foundation of emperors and kings. Thus, when it hears \"not exalting the worthy,\" it assumes they are abandoned in the wild; when it reads \"not prizing goods,\" it thinks they are cast aside unused. It takes \"abolishing learning\" to mean ignorance like that of beasts and calves, and \"abolishing sageliness\" to mean lawlessness like that of primordial chaos. It does not know that within the numinous chamber, even gold dust, if left to accumulate, will dim the radiance of the spirit. Therefore, the book casts aside both good and evil to reach the ultimate unity of emptiness and tranquility. Such depths are hard to fathom, and rightly so—it befuddles the wise.\n\nThus, these trustworthy words of the sagely one have been ranked among the treasured teachings of the Hundred Schools. To expound this subtle learning should be the task of the most divine.\n\nI prostrate myself before Your Imperial Majesty, who, possessing the essence of a perfected transcendent, has emerged to serve as sovereign and teacher, and whose overflowing marvelous root has taken form in great undertakings. You have rectified governance so that all affairs flourish, and reformed the age so that the Four Quarters place their trust in you. Now, you will align heart and form, shedding the burdens of governing things and nurturing the self; you will deepen the root and strengthen the stem to enter the gate of long life and enduring vision. You will unite the world with the land of Huaxu and behold the divine person on Mount Gushe. To reach the utmost of this attainment is most fitting for this time.\n\nYour subject, by nature dull and ignorant, was born to endure hardship. Ever aspiring to the clarity of dawn, I sought to dispel the obstinacy of Heaven. Casting my gaze widely, I examined its scattered and disparate aspects, then pared them away to seek their underlying unity. Time has been insufficient, and years have passed thus. Only lately, in these writings, have I suddenly felt as though I had gained something. Moving toward stillness, the myriad things return to their root; from turbidity to clarity, the dark center reveals the dawn. Thus, I have expressed my understanding in words. Though I call this self-contentment, I know not if it is fitting.\n\nI humbly regard the tranquil insight of the perfected person as the primal mirror for scholars. Daring to presume upon your attention, I offer this to discern its worth. Like the dragon’s scattered chapters, it is difficult to know its ascent to Heaven; yet, as the horse’s focused intelligence may grasp the Dao through debate, if even a single word proves of use, I would not shrink from ten thousand deaths.\n\nThe work I have composed, *Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, comprises four fascicles. With utmost reverence, I present this memorial and submit it for your consideration.\n\nYour subject Huiqing, with utmost reverence and trepidation, bows his head again and again and respectfully speaks.\n\nFirst month of the first year of the Yuanfeng reign,\n*Zizhengdian* Academician, *Tong*...\n\n**Memorial of the Scholar Brü Incense (Lü Huiqing) on the *True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***\n\n**Title of the Work:** *Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*\n**Author:** *Zizhengdian* Academician and *Tong* Official Lü Huiqing\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (The Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue)**\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\n\nThe Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\n\nEver without desire, one beholds its subtlety;\nEver with desire, one beholds its penetration.\n\nThese two, though issuing from the same source, bear different names—\nboth are called the Mysterious.\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—\nthe gateway through which all subtleties emerge.\n\nThe Commentary states:\nOf all the Dao in the world that can be spoken,\nnone is not the Dao—\nyet when it is spoken, it is perilous;\nthus it is the *non-eternal* Dao.\n\nOf all the names in the world that can be named,\nnone is not the *order*—\nyet when it is named, it is abandoned;\nthus it is the *non-eternal* Name.\n\nAll things flourish in their profusion,\neach returning to its root—\nyet they do not know it as *stillness*.\nStillness is called *returning to the primal command*;\nreturning to the primal command is called *constancy*.\n\nWhen one attains the Dao to *constancy*,\nthe mind congeals, the form dissolves,\nand self and objects are both forgotten—\nwho then knows the Dao that can be spoken\nor the Name that can be named?\n\nThus, the eternal Dao is indeed unspeakable,\nand so it is said:\n*\"The Dao endures long,\nand those who cling to it perish not.\"*\n\nThe eternal Name is indeed unnameable,\nand so it is said:\n*\"From ancient times to today,\nits Name does not fade.\"*\n\nNeither perishing nor fading—\nthis is called the eternal Dao.\n\nThe eternal Dao is without Name,\nand the Nameless is the Dao—\nthe origin from which Heaven and Earth first arose.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nAt the *Great Beginning*, there was the *Non-Being of Being*,\nand there was the *Nameless*.\nThe *Non-Being of Being* cannot be obtained,\nyet the *Nameless* is where the One arises—\nthe One before form took shape.\n\nOnce called the *One*,\nthough formless, it already bore a Name.\nThe Name is *One*,\nyet the one who names is *Two*—\nTwo and One make *Three*,\nand from this, all things proliferate.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The Named is the mother of all things.\"*\n\nTo know *constancy* is to be enlightened—\nenlightenment means seeing all things.\nThus, only *constancy* can be observed.\n\nWhen without desire,\nthe mind is pure, the vision profound, and flawless—\nhere one beholds its subtlety,\nand so it is said:\n*\"Ever without desire,\none may name its smallness.\"*\n\nWhen with desire,\nall things arise in profusion—\nhere one beholds its penetration,\nand so it is said:\n*\"All things return to it,\nyet they know no master—\none may name its greatness.\"*\n\nOnly through the small does one perceive its subtlety,\nonly through the great does one perceive its penetration.\n\nThese two, though issuing from the same source,\ndiffer only in name.\nTheir names differ,\nyet their essence does not truly differ.\nIf their essence does not truly differ,\nthen seeking their source—\ndesire and non-desire—\nboth cannot be obtained.\n\nIf they cannot be obtained,\nthen their source is the same—\nthus they are called the Mysterious.\n\nThe Mysterious as black aligns with red in unity;\nHeaven’s hue is Mysterious—\nyin and yang are one in unity.\nNames arise from the Mysterious—\ndesire and non-desire are one in unity.\n\nUnity is indeed subtle,\nyet subtle in unity is not yet subtle in multiplicity,\nsubtle in self is not yet subtle in things.\n\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—\nthen even the same cannot be obtained.\nIf the same cannot be obtained,\nthen One and Many, Self and Things—\nall are subtly manifest.\n\nThe subtlety of all things arises from this alone,\nand so it is said:\n*\"The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—\nthe gateway through which all subtleties emerge.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: \"When the World Knows Beauty\"**\n\nWhen the world knows beauty as beauty,\nthen ugliness already exists;\nwhen it knows goodness as goodness,\nthen wickedness already exists.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\ndifficulty and ease complete each other,\nlong and short define each other,\nhigh and low balance each other,\nharmony and discord resonate together,\nbefore and after follow each other.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without action,\nteaches without speech.\nAll things arise without resistance,\nare born without possession,\nare shaped without reliance,\nand when the work is done, takes no credit.\nOnly because they do not take credit\ndoes it not depart from them.\n\nThe Commentary states:\nWhen the world knows beauty as beauty and desires it,\nknows ugliness and wickedness as such and rejects them—\nyet speaking of them apart from the Dao,\neven beauty and goodness are distant from the Dao.\nSpeaking of them arising from the Dao,\neven ugliness and wickedness are not outside the Dao.\n\nThus observed,\nbeauty becomes ugliness,\ngoodness becomes wickedness—\nis this not true?\n\nTherefore, all things in the world arise from *being*,\nand *being* arises from *non-being*—\nthis is called the *interdependence of being and non-being*.\n\nDifficult tasks arise from ease,\nyet ease also arises from difficulty—\nthus there is no difficulty,\nand this is called the *completion of ease and difficulty*.\n\nWhen one knows the crane’s long stride,\nonly then does one know the hare’s short step;\nwhen one knows the hare’s short step,\nonly then does one know the crane’s long stride—\nthis is called the *definition of long and short*.\n\nIf high is taken as correct,\nthen all valleys are the source of rivers—\nhighness has what to lean upon low,\nand if low is taken as correct,\nthen rivers are the destination of all valleys—\nlow has what to lean upon high—\nthis is called the *balance of high and low*.\n\nThe yellow bell as master harmonizes the other tones,\nthe other tones as master harmonize the yellow bell—\nthis is called the *resonance of sounds*.\n\nFrom autumn and winter, one looks to spring and summer—\nthen spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow;\nfrom spring and summer, one looks to autumn and winter—\nthen autumn and winter come first, spring and summer follow—\nthis is called the *sequence of before and after*.\n\nAll these six pairs,\nwhen in their proper time and place,\nthe world calls them *beautiful* and *good*;\nwhen out of time and place,\nthe world calls them *ugly* and *wicked*.\n\nNow, who knows what is called *ultimate beauty* and *ultimate virtue*?\n\nFor beauty and ugliness, virtue and vice,\nthey merely alternate in their rise and fall—\nhow could they be constant?\n\nThus, the Sage, knowing this to be so,\nacts through the *Dao* in all things,\nyet his actions arise from *wuwei* [non-action].\nHe teaches through conventional names,\nyet his teaching arises from *non-speech*.\n\nWhen actions arise from *wuwei*,\nhe works all day yet never acts;\nwhen teaching arises from *non-speech*,\nhe speaks all day yet never speaks.\n\nThen beauty and ugliness, virtue and vice—\nwhy should I fix my heart upon them?\n\nIf this is so,\nthen wherever he goes, it is *wondrous*.\n\nIf wherever he goes is *wondrous*,\nthen the arising of all things—\nI do not see their arising or who makes them arise,\nI do not see their birth or who gives them birth,\nI do not see their making or who makes them.\n\nThus, though they arise or do not arise,\nthough they are born or not born,\nthough they are made or not made—\nwhat need have I for words, for possession, for reliance?\n\nThis is how *achievement is completed yet not dwelled upon*.\n\nIf one dwells upon it, then one must abandon it;\nif one does not dwell upon it within oneself,\nthen where could one abandon it?\n\n**Chapter Three: Not Esteeming the Virtuous**\nDo not esteem the virtuous, and the people will not contend;\ndo not prize hard-to-obtain goods, and the people will not steal;\ndo not display what is desirable, and the hearts of the people will not be disordered.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nempties their minds, fills their bellies,\nweakens their resolve, strengthens their bones.\nEver makes the people return to simplicity, to natural desires—\nso that the wise dare not act.\n\nIf one acts through *wuwei*,\nthen nothing will remain ungoverned.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nThe Sage knows that beauty is ugliness, virtue is vice,\nand I do not fix my heart upon them.\nThus, though I discard the world’s highest honors,\nI simply fulfill my duty—\nand the virtuous are not what I esteem.\nThough I gather the world’s wealth,\nI nourish virtue—\nand hard-to-obtain goods are not what I prize.\n\nThe people’s contentions\nalways arise from competing for virtue;\nknowing that virtue is not what the ruler esteems,\nthey will not contend.\nHence it is said: *\"To promote the virtuous is to make the people jostle.\"*\n\nThe people’s theft\nalways arises from desire for profit;\nknowing that wealth is not what the ruler prizes,\nthey will not steal.\nHence it is said: *\"If the child does not desire it,\nthough you reward him, he will not steal.\"*\n\nWhat the noble seeks is virtue;\nwhat the petty seeks is wealth.\nIf I do not show what is desirable,\nthen their hearts will not be disordered.\n\nYet this is not to abandon the virtuous in the wilds and not use them,\nnor to discard hard-to-obtain goods and leave them on the ground.\nIt is simply that internally, I do not harbor them in my heart,\nand externally, I do not leave their traces behind.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nempties their minds, fills their bellies,\nweakens their resolve, strengthens their bones.\nThe mind houses the *shen* [spirit], and the belly is the mind’s dwelling—\nif the mind is emptied, the *shen* is undiminished and the belly is filled.\nThe kidneys house the will, and the bones are the kidneys’ remnant—\nif the will is weakened, the *jing* [essence] is unshaken and the bones are strong.\n\nIf the mind is emptied while the belly is filled,\nthen the people are ever kept in simplicity.\nIf the will is weakened while the bones are strengthened,\nthen the people are ever kept without desire.\n\nThe wise, knowing that virtue is not what the ruler esteems\nand that wealth is not what the ruler prizes,\nwill not act for what is not profitable—\nthus they dare not act.\n\nOnly in this way\ndoes *wuwei* prevail,\nand governance is naturally achieved.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Effortlessness**\nThe Dao is effortless yet effective;\nblunting its sharpness, it is never full.\n\nDeep, it seems the origin of all things.\nBlunting its sharpness, resolving its entanglements,\nsoftening its brilliance, blending with dust—\nserene, it seems as if it might exist.\n\nI do not know whose child it is—\nit precedes the *Imperial Sovereign*.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nAll things carry *yin* while embracing *yang*,\nand the interplay of *qi* brings harmony.\nThus, the *effortless*—\nthis is the harmony of *yin* and *yang*.\n\n*Yin* is emptiness, *yang* is fullness;\nthe essence of the Dao is effortless,\nyet its application may not be full.\n\nIts essence is effortless,\nso having or lacking desire is called *mystery*.\n\nIts application is not full,\nso the mind is emptied and the will weakened,\never keeping the people without knowledge or desire.\n\nOnly in this way\ndoes it seem the origin of all things,\nyet seeking what makes it the origin—\nit is fundamentally unattainable;\nonly its semblance remains.\n\nThen how does one attain this Dao?\nBy blunting its sharpness, resolving its entanglements,\nsoftening its brilliance, blending with dust.\n\nWhen the mind exits and enters things, that is sharpness—\nblunt its sharpness and do not act.\nWhen things arrive and engage the mind, that is entanglement—\nresolve its entanglements and do not disturb.\n\nWhen sharpness is blunted and entanglements resolved,\nthe clarity of the constant shines forth from Heaven’s light.\n\nLight is beyond dust;\ndwelling in light without obscurity,\nit is harmonized yet not distinguished.\nDust is within light;\ndwelling in dust without dimness,\nit is blended yet not differentiated.\n\nOnly in this way\ndoes that which is called the origin\nseem as if it might exist.\n\n*Deep*—this speaks of its profundity.\n*Serene*—this speaks of its clarity.\n*Not full*—this is not a fixed emptiness.\n*Seems to exist*—this is not a fixed existence.\n\nEmptiness, fullness, existence, nonexistence—\nI do not fix my heart upon them,\nso how could I know their source of origin?\n\nI only see their birth from the Heavenly *shen* and the *Imperial Sovereign*—\nthus it is said: *I do not know whose child it is; it precedes the Imperial Sovereign.*\n\nIf there is *I*, *knowing*, *who*—\nthen the Dao is hidden.\nIf I do not know *who*,\nthen I also do not know *myself*—\nthis is the origin from which the true Dao emerges.\n\nIt precedes the Heavenly with its form,\nit precedes the *Imperial Sovereign* with its beginning—\nthus its status as prior to all form and instrument is clear.\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent;\nthey treat all things as *chúgǒu* [sacrificial dogs].\nThe Sage is not benevolent;\nhe treats the people as *chúgǒu*.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nis it not like discarding a broken key?\n\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever producing.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion;\nbetter to hold to the central way.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nThe Dao is obscure before the *Imperial Sovereign’s* form,\nand one does not know from whom it originates.\nThus, those who embody this Dao—\nhow could *benevolence* suffice to name them?\n\n**Chapter Five (continued): The Nature of Benevolence**\n\nBenevolence is but the human heart.\n\nHeaven and Earth embody this Dao—\nthey do not act from benevolence,\ntreating all things as *chúgǒu*.\nThe Sage embodies this Dao—\nthey do not act from benevolence,\ntreating the people as *chúgǒu*.\n\nThe *chúgǒu* is but an object\nthat is kept without benevolence.\n\nAll things are of the same body as Heaven and Earth.\nThe people are of the same body as the Sage.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth regard themselves as *chúgǒu*,\nthen their regard for all things and the people is no different.\nThus, to nurture and raise them—\nwhat need is there for benevolence?\n\nOnly the non-benevolent\ncan be called the Great Benevolence.\n\nThus, it is clear that between Heaven and Earth,\nit is indeed like discarding a broken key.\n\nFor the discarded key—\nits emptiness yet unyielding,\nits motion yet ever producing—\nis how it moves and yet endures.\n\nThus, the person who embodies this Dao\nspeaks from the unsaid alone.\n\nTo speak without speaking\nis to know *wuwei* [non-action].\n\nWhen sound manifests, it becomes speech;\nwhen action manifests, it becomes deed.\nTo speak or act—\nin essence, they are one.\n\nWhy?\nSpeech and deed share the same body—\nsuch is their nature.\n\nIf one does not know this,\nthen speech does not arise from the unsaid.\nSpeech not arising from the unsaid\ndeviates from the empty motion of the discarded key—\nthus, its excess and exhaustion are inevitable.\n\nConfucius said:\nWho among today’s singers understands this?\nTo know this is to know that speech arises from the unsaid.\n\nSpeech arises from the unsaid—\nno one escapes this truth.\nYet those who cannot grasp it\nfail to align their hearts\nwith the *You* [having] rather than the *Wu* [non-being],\nwith the *Qu* [taking] rather than the *Shi* [gathering].\nThey cannot harmonize with the Dao.\n\nTo neither have nor not have,\nto neither take nor gather,\nyet to harmonize with the Dao—\nthis is called *holding to the central way*.\n\nTo hold to the central way without ceasing\nis to know the purpose of speech.\nThus, much speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to make *holding to the central way* one’s duty.\n\nHence it is said:\nThe human heart is ever perilous,\nthe Dao-heart ever subtle.\nOnly the precise and singular\ncan steadfastly grasp the central way.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**\n\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the *Xuàn Dàn* [Mysterious Feminine].\nThe *Xuàn Dàn’s* gate—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nEndless, as if it exists,\nyet its use is effortless.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nThe *Gǔ* [Valley] is the formed—\nby obtaining *One*, it is empty yet full.\nThe *Shén* [Spirit] is the formless—\nby obtaining *One*, it is still yet responsive.\n\nThe person who can hold to the central way and obtain *One*\ncan make the formed body as empty as the *Gǔ*,\nthe formless heart as still as the *Shén*—\nthen the formed and formless unite, and death does not come.\n\nThe ancients aligned body with heart,\nheart with *qi*,\n*qi* with Spirit,\nSpirit with the *Wu* [Non-being].\nTheir teaching is this:\n\nTo unite is to not die;\nto not die is to not be born;\nthe unborn can give birth to all things—\nthis is called the *Xuàn Dàn*.\n\nThe *Xuàn* is the union of *You* and *Wu*.\nThe *Dàn* is the giver of life.\nThus it is said:\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the *Xuàn Dàn*.\n\nThe Dao generates Heaven and Earth from this—\nthus it is called the *Xuàn Dàn’s* gate,\nthe root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf one says it does not exist,\nit is endless yet never ceases.\nIf one says it exists,\nhow could one see its presence?\n\nIf it exists yet is not seen,\nif it does not exist yet is not absent—\nthen my use and preservation of it\nneed no deliberation—\nit is simply gathered, with no effort.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven Long, Earth Enduring**\n\nHeaven is long, Earth enduring.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure long because\nthey do not generate themselves—\nthus they can generate eternally.\n\nTherefore, the Sage places his body last,\nyet his body is first;\nsets his body aside,\nyet his body is preserved.\n\nIs it not because he has no selfishness?\nThus he fulfills his selfishness.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nLength and shortness are form;\nduration and nearness are time.\nHeaven moves with time,\nyet fears its form is insufficient—\nthus it is called \"long.\"\nEarth moves with form,\nyet fears its time is insufficient—\nthus it is called \"enduring.\"\n\nThe root of Heaven and Earth emerges from the *Xuàn Dàn*,\nthe substance of the *Xuàn Dàn* stands upon the undying *Gǔ* Spirit.\nTo not die is to not be born;\nthe unborn can give birth to all things—\nthus the Earth can endure long.\n\nThe Sage does not consider his body a burden.\nWhen forced by necessity, yet none can stop him—\nthus it is said: \"Place his body last, yet his body is first.\"\nEstablished in the *Wu Hé Yǒu* [Non-Existent],\nyet none can harm him—\nthus it is said: \"Set his body aside, yet his body is preserved.\"\n\nThe body is his private concern.\nTo place it last, to set it aside—\nis to be public and without selfishness.\nWithout selfishness,\none can fulfill their selfishness.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good Is Like Water**\n\nThe supreme good is like water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend;\nit dwells where others disdain—\nthus it approaches the Dao.\n\nTo dwell is to choose good ground;\nto be still is to have a deep heart;\nto act is to be benevolent;\nto speak is to be trustworthy;\nto govern is to be orderly;\nto act is to be capable;\nto move is to be timely.\n\nOnly because it does not contend\ndoes it incur no blame.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nOne *yin* and one *yang*—this is the Dao.\nTo follow it is good.\nTo call it \"following\" is already to depart from the Dao,\nno longer its true body.\n\nThe supreme good is the Dao’s true good—\nnot what the world knows as good.\nThus, it is like water.\n\nFor water benefits all things yet does not contend,\ndwells where others disdain—\nand so the supreme good is likewise.\nThough not perfect,\nit nearly approaches the Dao.\n\nThe rivers and seas reign over all valleys\nbecause they are low—\nthus, to dwell is to choose good ground.\nThe stillness of a pool is deep,\nthe stillness of flowing water is deep—\nthus, to be still is to have a deep heart.\n\nThe *Commentary* says:\nTo receive and not be full,\nto draw and not be exhausted—\nthus, in giving, it is supremely good.\n\nTo act boldly yet remain trustworthy—\nthus, in speech, it is supremely trustworthy.\n\nIts branches become rivers and valleys,\nits gathering becomes the seas—\nthus, in governance, it is supremely effective.\n\nNothing is softer or weaker than water,\nyet in overcoming strength, none can surpass it—\nthus, in action, it is supremely capable.\n\nIts source flows ceaselessly,\nday and night without pause,\nfilling the basin before advancing—\nthus, in movement, it is supremely timely.\n\nIn essence, it arises from non-contention,\nand takes dwelling in good ground as its root—\nthus it is said:\nOnly by not contending\ndoes one ensure none can contend with it,\nand so there is no blame.\n\n---\n**Chapter Nine: \"Holding Fullness\"**\nTo hold fullness to the brim,\nis not as good as ceasing before it.\nTo sharpen to a point,\ncannot be long preserved.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nyet none can guard them;\nwealth and honor bring arrogance,\nand one invites calamity.\n\nWhen achievement is complete,\nreputation fulfilled,\nwithdraw—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\n\nThe *Commentary* says:\nTo hold is to prevent overflow,\nbut to fill to the brim is to risk it.\nIf one wishes to avoid overflow,\none must avoid filling to the brim—\nthus, *\"to hold fullness to the brim,\nis not as good as ceasing before it.\"*\n\nTo measure is to fear loss,\nbut to sharpen to a point is to risk it.\nIf one wishes to avoid loss,\none must avoid sharpening to a point—\nthus, *\"to sharpen to a point,\ncannot be long preserved.\"*\n\nTo be full yet not overflow\nis how one long preserves wealth;\nbut to hold fullness to the brim\nmeans gold and jade fill the hall,\nyet none can guard them.\n\nTo be high yet not precarious\nis how one long preserves nobility;\nbut to sharpen to a point\nbrings arrogance in wealth and honor,\nand one invites retribution.\n\nThen how does one escape this ruin?\nOnly by following the Way of Heaven.\n\nIndeed, when achievement is complete,\nreputation fulfilled,\nwithdraw—\nthis is the Way of Heaven,\nthe means by which the private is accomplished without selfishness.\n\nDid the Keeper of Seals tell Yao to retreat,\nthus embodying the Way of Heaven?\n\n---\n**Chapter Ten: \"Nurturing the Vital Essence\"**\nTo bear the vital essence and embrace unity,\ncan one remain undivided?\n\nTo focus the *qi* and attain softness,\ncan one be like an infant?\n\nTo purify and observe the subtle,\ncan one be without flaw?\n\nTo love the people and govern the state,\ncan one act without doing?\n\nTo open and close the heavenly gate,\ncan one be receptive like the female?\n\nTo be clear and all-pervading,\ncan one be without knowing?\n\nTo nurture and cherish life,\nto give birth yet not possess,\nto act yet not rely,\nto grow yet not dominate—\nthis is called *Xuan* Virtue.\n\nThe *Commentary* says:\nFor one to have their body for long,\nyet retreat to embody the Way of Heaven\nwithout being burdened by achievement and reputation—\nis this not difficult?\n\nYet there is a method.\n\nWhen life first transforms, it is called *po* (vital breath).\nWhen *po* and *jing* (essence) unite,\nit is still and complete.\n\nOnce *po* is born, the male aspect is *hun* (ethereal soul).\nWhen *hun* and spirit interact,\nand *po* scatters with essence entering and exiting,\nthen *po* is scattered and does not embrace unity,\ndivided and not held.\n\nTo *load* is to complete and begin anew;\nto *nurture* is to encircle without gap.\n\nThough one has already become human,\nif one bears the vital essence, embraces unity,\nand remains tranquil and non-acting,\nlike the beginning of life’s transformation,\nthen one can remain undivided.\n\nTo remain undivided\nis to focus the *qi* without division,\nto attain softness without resistance,\nand thus be like an infant.\n\nTo be like an infant\nis to purge regret and stinginess,\nto observe subtlety and marvel at the profound,\nto perceive the slightest movement—\nI must know it and be without flaw.\n\nThus, in nurturing the inner self,\none can love the people and govern the state\nwithout being burdened by affairs,\nand act without doing.\n\nWithin, to purify and observe the subtle without flaw,\nwithout, to love the people and govern the state without doing—\nthen the heavenly gate opens and closes,\nconstantly within me,\nand I can be receptive like the female.\n\nNot advancing, not resisting,\nresponding yet not hoarding—\nthen one is clear and all-pervading,\nand can be without knowing.\n\nWhen the Way reaches non-knowing,\nthat is true knowing—\nthis is how one appears human yet is Heavenly.\nWhat need for the burden of achievement and reputation?\n\nTo nurture and cherish life,\nto give birth yet not possess,\nto act yet not rely,\nto grow yet not dominate—\nthis is how one aligns with Heaven.\n\n*Xuan* Virtue has no other source—\nit is the Virtue of Heaven.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eleven: \"Thirty Spokes Converging at the Hub\"**\nThirty spokes converge at one hub;\nits utility lies in its emptiness—\nthus, the carriage serves.\n\nClay is shaped into vessels;\nits utility lies in its emptiness—\nthus, the vessel serves.\n\nDoors and windows are carved for rooms;\nits utility lies in its emptiness—\nthus, the room serves.\n\nTherefore, having is for advantage,\nemptiness is for use.\n\nThe *Commentary* says:\nThirty spokes converge at one hub;\nits utility lies in its emptiness—\nthe carriage is what I ride.\n\nClay is shaped into vessels;\nits utility lies in its emptiness—\nthe vessel is what I use.\n\nDoors and windows are carved for rooms;\nits utility lies in its emptiness—\nthe room is where I dwell.\n\nWhen riding, I observe the carriage;\nwhen using, I observe the vessel;\nwhen dwelling, I observe the room—\ntheir use is never absent,\nyet their emptiness is never distant.\n\nAs for the body,\nwhy do I not know what I use it for?\n\nThus, having is for advantage,\nemptiness is for use.\n\nIf having is for advantage,\nand emptiness is not for use,\nthen what is called advantage\nis also discarded and unused.\n\nIf emptiness is for use,\nand having is not for advantage,\nthen what is called use\nis also harmful and not advantageous.\n\nTherefore, the Sage enters without possessing anything—\nthis is how emptiness serves as use.\n\nExits without lacking anything—\nthis is how having serves as advantage.\n\nThus it is said:\nTo refine essence and enter the divine\nis to achieve use;\nto benefit use and secure the body\nis to elevate virtue.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twelve: \"The Five Colors\"**\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deafen the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the palate,\nhunting and chasing drive the mind to madness,\nrare treasures lead to erratic conduct.\n\nTherefore, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—\nthus, he discards the latter and takes the former.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: \"The Chapter on Honor and Humiliation\"**\nIt is said: The reason the eye is an eye is that it perceives colors yet is not itself a color. When it is bound to the five colors, it loses its true nature as an eye and becomes no different from blindness. The reason the ear is an ear is that it perceives sounds yet is not itself a sound. When it is bound to the five tones, it loses its true nature as an ear and becomes no different from deafness. The reason the mouth is a mouth is that it perceives flavors yet is not itself a flavor. When it is bound to the five flavors, it loses its true nature as a mouth and becomes no different from dullness.\n\nWhen nothing in the ten thousand things can perturb it, the mind remains still and attains sageliness. To chase after externals is to lose all thought and fall into madness—this applies to all things, but hunting and chasing are especially so. Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace; knowing when to stop brings no peril. To act in accordance with this is to preserve oneself. To seek beyond is to invite disgrace and peril, to obstruct one’s path—this applies to all things, but rare treasures are especially so.\n\nThe belly knows nothing, the eyes see much—thus the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes. Therefore, he discards the pursuit of what is seen and desired, and takes instead the emptiness and stillness of what knows nothing and desires nothing.\n\nHonor and humiliation are like sudden shocks;\ngreat calamity is like a threat to one’s body.\n\nWhat is meant by \"honor and humiliation as sudden shocks\"?\nHonor is a lower path—when one obtains it, it is like a shock; when one loses it, it is like a shock. This is called \"honor and humiliation as sudden shocks.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"valuing great calamity as one’s body\"?\nThe reason I have great calamity is that I have a body.\nWhen I have no body, what calamity can I have?\nThus, to value the body as the world is as if one could entrust the world to it;\nto love the body as the world is as if one could commit the world to it.\n\nIt is said: Honor is what is kept by others—it is the lower path. If one clings to one’s honor, then humiliation follows. The reason I have humiliation is that I have shock—before obtaining it, I am shocked by obtaining it; after obtaining it, I am shocked by losing it. If I had no shock, what humiliation could I have? Thus, the humiliation that comes with honor is no more than this.\n\nNobility is what keeps others—it is the higher path. If one clings to one’s nobility, then great calamity follows. The reason I have great calamity is that I have a body, so both joy and misfortune rest upon me. If I had no body, what joy could I have? Thus, the great calamity that comes with nobility is no more than this.\n\nTo speak of the body is to know shock as the mind;\nto speak of shock is to know the body as a burden.\nWithout mind, there is no shock;\nwithout shock, there is no humiliation;\nwithout body, there is no burden;\nwithout burden, there is no calamity.\n\nIn ancient times, Shun, as a commoner, befriended the Son of Heaven—this was indeed honor. Yet if he had clung to it, what humiliation could there be? The vastness of ruling the world was indeed nobility, yet if he had not taken ownership of it, what great joy could there be?\n\nThus, to value the body as the world is as if one could entrust the world to it.\nIf one invites humiliation through honor, then one degrades one’s body—this is not one who can entrust the world to it.\nTo love the body as the world is as if one could commit the world to it.\nIf one incurs calamity through nobility, then one endangers one’s body—this is not one who can commit the world to it.\n\nOnly he who does not cling to his honor or his nobility—like Shun—is truly one who can entrust and commit the world to him.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: \"The Chapter on the Unseen\"**\nThat which is unseen when viewed is called *yí* (uniform);\nthat which is unheard when listened to is called *xī* (rare);\nthat which cannot be grasped is called *wēi* (subtle).\n\nThese three cannot be forced or questioned,\nso they merge into one.\n\nIts upper aspect is not bright,\nits lower aspect is not dark.\n\nIt is boundless yet cannot be named—\nit returns to nothingness.\n\nThis is called the form of formlessness,\nthe image of no-thing—\nthis is called *hūhuǎng* (dim and vague).\n\nApproach it and you see no head;\nfollow it and you see no tail.\n\nHold fast to the ancient Dao\nto govern the present.\n\nTo know the ancient beginning is to hold the thread of the Way.\n\nIt is said: Vision is non-being, so it is unseen.\nThough unseen, it can manifest as dark or yellow—\nit cannot be named as having no color,\nso it is called *yí* alone.\n\nHearing is non-being, so it is unheard.\nThough unheard, it can manifest as *gōng* or *shāng*—\nit cannot be named as having no sound,\nso it is called *xī* alone.\n\nGrasp is non-being, so it cannot be grasped.\nThough not grasped, it can manifest as yin or yang,\nas soft or hard,\nas short or long,\nas round or square,\nas life or death,\nas heat or cold,\nas floating or sinking,\nas emerging or vanishing,\nas sweet or bitter,\nas rank or fragrant—\nit cannot be named as having no form,\nso it is called *wēi* alone.\n\nSome things may be sought and obtained through force,\nbut these three cannot be forced.\nIf they cannot be forced,\nthen one’s ears and eyes are confused,\none’s form and wisdom depart,\nand yet I attain them—\nthen vision, hearing, and grasp merge into one.\n\nVision is through the eyes,\nhearing is through the ears,\ngrasp is through the mind.\nWhen they merge into one,\nthe ears become like eyes,\nthe eyes become like ears,\nthe mind becomes like eyes and ears.\n\nThose who lose the Way see light above and mud below—\nI have attained it, yet its upper aspect is not light,\nso it is not bright;\nits lower aspect is not mud,\nso it is not dark.\n\nBoundless yet true and trustworthy,\nthough it can be trusted,\nit cannot be named—\nthus it returns to nothingness alone.\n\nThough it is nothingness,\nit is called the form of formlessness,\nthe image of no-thing—\nyet it is never truly nothingness.\n\nThis is called *hūhuǎng*—\nnot bright, so it seems to doubt nothingness,\nyet it is not nothingness;\ndim, so it seems to doubt somethingness,\nyet it is not somethingness.\n\nIts beginning has no front, so when you meet it, you cannot see its head;\nits end has no tail, so when you follow it, you cannot see its rear.\nWith neither front nor rear, it is neither ancient nor modern.\nThough neither ancient nor modern, it is never truly without ancient and modern—\nthus it endures beyond the ancient past without growing old.\nI have attained it and call it *use*—\nso it is said: grasp the Dao of the ancient to govern the present’s existence.\n\nWhat is called the ancient is not different from the present—\nit is to know the ancient’s origin.\nWhat is called the present is not different from the ancient—\nit is to know the present’s source.\n\nIf one truly knows the ancient’s origin,\nthen one knows the present’s source.\n\nThe origin has no source,\nthe coming has no origin—\nthis is called the beginningless beginning.\nThe beginningless beginning is the Dao’s measure.\nThe Dao cannot be grasped,\nyet attaining this, one can grasp it as virtue—\ngrasp virtue, this is called measure.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Master of the Way**\n\nThe ancient master of the Way was subtle, mysterious, and profound—\nso deep it could not be known.\nBecause it could not be known,\nhe forced himself to assume outward forms:\nCautious as one crossing a river in winter,\nfearful as if wary of neighbors,\nsolemn as a guest,\nmelting like ice about to thaw,\nsolid as uncarved wood,\nvast as a valley,\nmuddy as turbid water.\n\nWho can make turbid water still and gradually clear?\nWho can make the settled move and gradually give birth?\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\nBecause they do not desire fullness,\nthey can endure wear without renewal.\n\nIt is said: The ancient master of the Way\nwould perfect the Sage and exhaust the spirit.\nThough not yet reaching Sagehood or spirit,\nhis method to perfect the Sage and exhaust the spirit\nwas already fully heard.\n\nSubtle, then mysterious;\nmysterious, then profound;\nprofound, then penetrating—\nthus it is too deep to be known.\nBecause it cannot be known,\nhow could its outward form be compared or discussed?\nHe only forced himself to assume these forms.\n\nCautious as one crossing a river in winter—\nurged, then he moves;\nforced, then he rises.\n\nFearful as if wary of neighbors—\nkeeping evil at bay while preserving sincerity,\nnot held by things, so his mind does not stray.\n\nSolemn as a guest—\nnot the host.\n\nMelting like ice about to thaw—\nabout to complete with mind concentrated and form released,\nbones and flesh both dissolving.\n\nSolid as uncarved wood—\nreturning to its origin.\n\nVast as a valley—\nresponding without hoarding.\n\nMuddy as turbid water—\nno entanglement in *this* and *that*, *me* and *you*.\n\nAll men are bright and clear—\nwho can make turbid water still and gradually clear?\nGradually clear, then nothing escapes its illumination.\n\nAll men seek precedence—\nwho can make the settled move and gradually give birth?\nGradually give birth, then nothing escapes its emergence.\n\nTo desire stillness, one must level the breath;\nto desire spirit, one must follow the heart.\nIf one acts yet seeks correctness,\nit is forced beyond necessity.\nLeveling the breath, following the heart—\nthis is how one gradually clears.\nForced beyond necessity—\nthis is how one gradually gives birth.\nThis is how the master of the Way\ncan perfect the Sage and exhaust the spirit.\n\nThe Dao’s essence is *chong*—\n*chong* is the harmony of yin and yang,\nthe preservation of fullness and emptiness.\nYet those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness—\nthus it is emptiness alone.\nYet it is not called emptiness,\nbut always *not full*—\nlest people be burdened by emptiness.\nBurdened by emptiness, it is no longer emptiness—\nso it is said: *sometimes not full*, but simply not desiring fullness.\n\nAll things under heaven have newness, then wear,\nwear, then ruin—\nfew can avoid wear.\nOnly by not desiring fullness\ndoes newness, wear, ruin, and formation\nfind no place in the heart—\nthus though worn, it is not worn,\nand though not worn, it is neither new nor formed.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Extremes of Emptiness**\n\nAttain the extremes of emptiness,\nguard stillness with sincerity.\nWhen all things arise together,\nI observe their return.\n\nThings teem and flourish,\neach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nstillness is called restoring the Mandate.\nRestoring the Mandate is called constancy;\nknowing constancy is called clarity.\nNot knowing constancy leads to reckless action—disaster.\nKnowing constancy is tolerance;\ntolerance is impartiality;\nimpartiality is kingship;\nkingship is Heaven;\nHeaven is the Dao;\nthe Dao is enduring—\ndying without peril.\n\nIt is said: Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness,\nyet their governance is empty yet not extreme,\ntheir stillness is guarded yet not rigid—\nthis is not the utmost of *not full*.\n\nCommon men, when exhausted, see things return;\nwhen decayed, see things return to their roots.\nBut I, with utmost emptiness and stillness,\nsee how all things arise and why they teem—\nin me, not in them.\nTheir arising is their returning.\nWhen they teem, it is their returning to roots.\n\nThus, observing their arising together,\nI see their returning—\nwhen they teem, each returning to its root.\n\nThen what is called emptiness?\nNot emptied by emptiness,\nbut simply not filled—\nthus it is emptiness.\n\nWhat is called stillness?\nNot stilled by stillness—\nthings teem, each returning to its root, yet unaware,\nand nothing can disturb the mind—\nthus it is stillness.\nThus returning to the root is called stillness.\n\nThe Mandate is what I receive to live.\nOnly in stillness does one restore what gives life,\nand can command things—\nthus stillness is called restoring the Mandate.\n\nWhen the Dao reaches commanding things,\nit is constant and does not depart—\nthus restoring the Mandate is called constancy.\n\nObserving from constancy,\nfortune and misfortune, regret and blame\nare seen in the subtlest movements—\nwhat more clarity is needed?\nThus knowing constancy is called clarity.\n\nThose who do not know constancy act in opposition—\ntheir actions cannot escape recklessness.\n\nIf one knows constancy and embodies it,\nall things and I become one—\nthus knowing constancy is tolerance.\n\nWhen all things and I are one,\nthen there is no self-seeking within the body—\nthus tolerance becomes public virtue.\n\nWhen all things and I are one,\nand there is no selfishness—\nthis is greatness, and greatness is sagehood.\nInner sagehood, outer kingship—\nthus public virtue becomes kingship.\n\nSagehood then reaches the divine—\nthus kingship becomes Heaven.\nHeaven is divine—\nthe Dao is what perfects sagehood and fulfills the divine—\nthus Heaven is the Dao.\n\nTo practice the Dao until reaching constancy\nis to exhaust it—\nthus the Dao is enduring, and one’s life is secure.\nWhen enduring reaches the point where one’s life is secure,\nthis is called constancy.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sage**\nThe Supreme Sage knows existence is real;\nthe next knows it through affection and praise;\nthe next knows it through fear and contempt.\n\nWhen trust is insufficient, there is distrust—\nthus words are precious.\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nthe people say, *\"It was natural.\"*\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Hold fast to the Great Image—\nthe world follows.\nBecause the world is about to release me and forget me,\nhow can my traces be seen?\"*\nThus, the next knows existence is real.\n\nThose who know existence is real\ncannot be surpassed—\nthus they are called Supreme Sage.\nThose who are praised and honored are next,\nand those feared and scorned are next—\nthis is clear.\n\nHow can this be explained?\nNow, the love and reverence between father and son\nrequires no words to understand.\nBut in guest-host relations or friendships,\nto convey the intent of reverence,\none must adorn it with words before it is understood.\nWhy?\nBecause trust is sufficient or insufficient.\n\nThus, praise and affection arise from insufficient trust and distrust—\nhow much more so for fear and contempt?\n\nIf one wishes to make trust insufficient and distrustful,\nhow should they proceed?\nMake words precious,\nand return to the Dao.\n\nTo make words precious\nis to practice the teaching of non-action.\nTo practice the teaching of non-action\nis to engage in affairs of non-doing.\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nthe people say, *\"It was natural,\"*\nand none know who did it—\nwho then can praise or honor them?\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Decayed**\nWhen the Great Dao decays, there is benevolence and righteousness;\nwhen wisdom arises, there is great deceit;\nwhen familial bonds fracture, there is filial piety and kindness;\nwhen states are chaotic, there are loyal ministers.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The Dao cannot be named—\nto name it the Dao\nis already not the Dao.*\nThus, it is divided into benevolence and righteousness—\nhow can this be the whole of the Dao?\n\nThe greatest thief is when virtue has a mind and the mind has eyes,\nand when eyes turn inward—\ninward vision leads to ruin.\nThus, when wisdom arises, there is great deceit.\nDeceit is the reversal of virtue.\n\nWhen benevolence and righteousness exist,\ntheir flaws lead to fractured familial bonds and filial piety.\nWhen great deceit exists,\nits flaws lead to chaotic states and loyal ministers.\n\nThus, there are the stubbornness of the blind and the arrogance of the crippled,\nand only then does there arise Shun.\nThere are the tyrannies of Jie and Zhou,\nand only then do there arise Longfeng and Bi Gan.\nThis is no other reason—\nthe farther one strays from the root.\n\n**End of Volume One of the *True Transmission of the Dao and Its Virtue***\n**Volume Two of the *True Transmission of the Dao and Its Virtue***\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Abandoning Wisdom**\n\nTo discard the Sage and abandon wisdom,\nthe people’s benefit is a hundredfold.\nTo discard benevolence and abandon righteousness,\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nTo discard cleverness and abandon profit,\nthieves and robbers vanish.\n\nThese three things—\nthough insufficient as adornment—\nare thus made to have their proper place.\n\nTo manifest simplicity and embrace purity,\nto reduce selfishness and diminish desires.\n\nThe transmission says:\nThe Sage knows that the world’s chaos\nbegins with confusion of the root and loss of nature.\nOnly the nameless purity can settle it.\nTo discard the Sage and abandon wisdom,\nto discard benevolence and abandon righteousness,\nto discard cleverness and abandon profit—\nthis is how we restore our nameless purity and settle it.\n\nTo discard the Sage and abandon wisdom,\nto discard benevolence and abandon righteousness,\nthen the mind is not burdened by beauty and goodness.\nTo discard cleverness and abandon profit,\nthen the mind is not burdened by evil and wrongdoing.\nWithin, the mind is not burdened,\nwithout, no trace is left behind—\nthus the people’s benefit is a hundredfold,\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness,\nand thieves and robbers vanish—\nthis is their natural course.\n\nIndeed, to discard the Sage and abandon wisdom,\nto discard benevolence and abandon righteousness,\nis not merely to cease honoring the worthy—\nto discard and abandon them means more than mere cessation.\nTo discard cleverness and abandon profit,\nis not merely to cease valuing rare goods—\nto discard and abandon them means more than mere disdain.\n\nHuman life—\nall things are already complete within us—\nthus there is the utmost abundance of wealth.\nTo discard the Sage and abandon wisdom and return to the origin,\nthen its benefit is a hundredfold.\nThe people return to filial piety and kindness,\nand the six relations are harmonious,\nyet they do not know what filial piety is.\nThieves and robbers vanish,\nand the state governs well,\nyet they do not know what loyal ministers are.\nTo cease honoring the worthy,\nso the people do not contend—\nthe people’s benefit is a hundredfold,\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness—\nthis is more than mere non-contention.\nTo cease valuing rare goods,\nso the people do not steal—\nthieves and robbers vanish—\nthis is more than mere non-theft.\n\nThe Sage’s wisdom, benevolence and righteousness,\ncleverness and profit—\nthese three things are adornment, not substance,\ninsufficient and incomplete.\nThus they are discarded and abandoned,\nso that their proper place may be restored.\n\nTo manifest simplicity and embrace purity,\nto reduce selfishness and diminish desires—\nthis is their proper place.\nTo manifest simplicity means to know it is unmixed and not adorned,\nto embrace purity means to know it is undispersed and not insufficient.\nSimple yet unmixed, pure yet undispersed—\nthen nature is restored,\nand external things cannot confuse,\nwhile selfishness is reduced and desires diminished.\nOnly then can one speak of the ultimate Dao of discarding learning.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Discarding Learning Brings No Worry**\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Sage’s Virtue and Form**\n\n*\"Yes\" and \"No\"—how far apart are they?\nGood and evil—how distant are they?\nWhat people fear, one must not fail to fear.\nAh, boundless—its endlessness!\n\nThe crowd rejoices, feasting on grand sacrifices,\nascending spring platforms.\nI alone am timid, yet unformed—\nlike an infant before speech,\nwandering, as if nowhere to return.\n\nThe crowd all have abundance,\nwhile I alone seem forsaken.\nOh, my foolish heart—so pure!\nThe common man is bright and clear,\nwhile I alone seem dim;\nthe common man is sharp and discerning,\nwhile I alone am muddled.\nObscured as if in darkness,\nsilent, as if without end.\nThe crowd all have their ways,\nwhile I alone seem dull and coarse.\nI alone differ from others,\nvaluing the Mother-Nourisher.\n\nThe Classic says:\nAbove, abandon the Sage’s wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness—\nbelow, abandon cleverness and profit—\nso as not to burden the mind,\nand thus attain *Discarding Learning*.\nDiscarding Learning means *Non-Action*;\n*Non-Action* means *Spirit*;\n*Spirit* is the movement of all things\nwithout sharing the Sage’s worries.\nThus it is said: *Discarding Learning brings no worry.*\n\n*\"Yes\" and \"No\"* arise from a single sound—\nhow far apart are they?\nGood and evil separate from the One Dao—\nhow distant are they?\nThis is why even the Sage abandons them,\nso as not to burden the mind.\n\nRegret and fear arise from rigidity;\ncalm without blame arises from repentance—\nthus what people fear, one must not fail to fear.\n\nAh, boundless—its endlessness!\nEndlessness speaks of its vastness without limit,\nand not merely fearing what others fear.\n\nThe noble one, cautious and mindful,\nfears what is right and follows the Great,\naligns with Heaven and the Dao.\n\nWhat people fear, one must not fail to fear—\nthis is to align with humanity.\nAh, boundless—its endlessness!\nThis is to align with Heaven.\n\nThe crowd rejoices, yet they do not close their senses,\nnor shut their gates.\nFeasting on grand sacrifices,\nthey do not know the simplicity of true flavor.\nAscending spring platforms,\nthey do not know the insufficiency of what is seen.\nI alone am timid, yet unformed—\nlike an infant before speech—\nthus I close my senses,\nshut my gates,\nand find no taste to crave,\nno sight to delight in.\nWandering, as if nowhere to return—\nspeaking of how all things ride upon it,\nyet in me there is no dwelling.\n\nThe crowd feast on grand sacrifices,\nascend spring platforms—\nthus they all have abundance.\nI alone am timid, yet unformed—\nlike an infant before speech—\nthus I alone seem forsaken.\nAll this speaks of abandoning things and departing from form.\n\nOh, my foolish heart—\nspeaking of its original knowing.\nPure—speaking of its unmixed nature.\nThe common man is bright and clear,\nwhile I alone seem dim—\nthus I differ from the common man’s brightness.\nThe common man is sharp and discerning,\nwhile I alone am muddled—\nthus I differ from the common man’s sharpness.\nObscured as if in darkness—\ndarkness means seeing nothing at all.\nSeeing nothing at all—\nnot merely dim and muddled—\nin motion, wandering as if nowhere to return;\nin stillness, silent as if without end.\nThe common man is bright and clear,\nthe common man is sharp and discerning—\nthus they all have their ways.\nI alone seem dim, I alone seem muddled—\nthus I seem dull and coarse.\nAll this speaks of departing from wisdom and forgetting the mind.\n\nSight, hearing, thought, and deliberation—\nthese arise from the Dao.\nThus the Dao is their Mother,\nwhile they are its children.\nYet the crowd chase after things,\nenslaving their wisdom,\nto nourish their sight, hearing, thought, and deliberation—\nthus they only nourish their children.\nBut I abandon and depart from them,\nfor I value nourishing the Mother.\nThus it is said: *I alone differ from others, valuing the Mother-Nourisher.*\n\nThe Old Master was divine—\nwhat did He cultivate to nourish?\nOnly that He differed from the common and vulgar,\nto teach those who seek the Dao\nthat this is how one may attain it.\nThus the great intent of *Discarding Learning* is known.\n\nYet the earlier scholars said:\n*\"If a man does not learn, though worry-free like a beast,\nhow little they know of the meaning of Discarding Learning to bring no worry!\"*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Sage’s Virtue and Form**\nThe Sage’s virtue follows only the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing—\nonly vague, only hazy.\nHazy and vague—\nwithin it, there are forms;\nVague and hazy—\nwithin it, there are things.\nDeep and dark—\nwithin it, there is essence,\nits essence most true,\nwithin it, there is faithfulness.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nits name does not fade,\nto observe all things.\n\nHow do I know all things are thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe Classic says:\nWhen abandoning things and departing from form\nuntil one seems forsaken,\nwhen departing from wisdom and forgetting the mind\nuntil one seems coarse—\nthen one’s virtue is at its peak.\n\nFrom what shall one follow?\nOnly the Dao.\n\nAs a thing—\nonly vague, only hazy.\nWhen hazy and vague,\nvague then is not confused—\nnot confused, then clear—\nclear, then doubts there are things—\nyet within it, there are forms.\nForms—\ndoubting there are things yet not things—\nthus it is said: *\"The form of the formless,\"*\nand again: *\"The Great Form has no shape.\"*\n\nWhen vague and hazy,\nhazy then is not bright—\nnot bright, then dark—\ndark, then doubts there are no things—\nyet within it, there are things.\nThings—\ndoubting there are no things yet there are—\nthus it is said: *\"The state of the stateless,\"*\nand again: *\"Things in confusion take form.\"*\n\nVague and hazy—then unfathomable;\nunfathomable—then divine.\nDeep and dark—\nthe divine beyond the divine.\nThe divine beyond the divine yet able to refine—\nthus it is said: *Deep and dark—within it, there is essence.*\nEssence—\nobtaining the Dao’s One without mixture.\nUnder Heaven, all things are true yet not false,\nfaithful yet not forceful,\nconstant yet unchanging—\nnothing surpasses this.\nAnd the beginning of all things,\nI observe it here—\nthus it is said: *Its essence is most true, within it, there is faithfulness.*\nFrom ancient times to now,\nits name does not fade,\nto observe all things.\n\nThus, those who cultivate the Dao do not seek clarity nor obscurity,\nbut preserve its hazy vagueness.\nThey neither see nor hear,\nbut govern its profound darkness.\nWhen there is form, there are things;\nwhen there are things, there is essence;\nwhen there is essence, there is faithfulness.\nWhen cultivating the Dao reaches faithfulness,\nit aligns with my heart and all things are attained.\n\nTo know how Heaven, Earth, and all things become what they are—\nnone do not begin here.\nThus it is said: *How do I know all things are thus?*\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter 22: \"Curving Completes\"**\nCurving completes, bending makes straight,\nhollow fills, worn renews,\nfewness gains, excess confuses.\nThus the Sage embraces the One as the model for all under Heaven.\n\nNot self-illuminating, hence clarity;\nnot self-affirming, hence manifest;\nnot self-praising, hence merit;\nnot self-exalting, hence longevity.\nOnly by not contending does one surpass all contention.\nWas the ancient saying *\"Curving completes\"* mere empty words?\nTruly complete, and thus it returns.\n\nThe Classic says: *To know all things as they are, then one can embrace the One and align with gentleness.*\nTo embrace the One and govern gentleness,\nthen one can curve, can bend,\ncan hollow, can wear.\nCurving is the natural way of curving;\nbending is the forced way of curving.\nOf all things under Heaven, only water approaches the Dao.\nFlowing west, then east—nothing can harm it: *this is curving completing.*\nAvoiding obstacles, yet always eastward: *this is bending straightening.*\nDescending well, all valleys flow to it: *this is hollow filling.*\nReceiving all filth, yet never unclean: *this is worn renewing.*\nOnly those who obtain the One suffice for this,\nthus it is said: *fewness gains.*\nCommon people cannot do this because they lack unity,\nthus it is said: *excess confuses.*\n\nIn managing wealth, there must be a model;\nin passing on land and timber, there must be a model.\nWhat is held is few, yet what is responded to is broad.\nThe Sage embraces the One as the model for all under Heaven—\nthus can one curve, can one bend,\ncan one hollow, can one wear.\nNowhere is there anything but the One,\nthus following what all under Heaven sees and seeing it,\nyet not self-illuminating—\nthen all that is seen is examined without flaw,\nthus it is said: *not self-illuminating, hence clarity.*\nFollowing what all under Heaven affirms and affirming it,\nyet not self-affirming—\nthen all that is affirmed cannot be concealed,\nthus it is said: *not self-affirming, hence manifest.*\nReturning all under Heaven’s merit to oneself,\nyet not self-praising—\nthen merit is attained,\nthus it is said: *not self-praising, hence merit.*\nEntrusting all things with ability,\nyet not self-exalting—\nthen longevity is attained,\nthus it is said: *not self-exalting, hence longevity.*\nSuch is no other—\nobtaining the One means no self,\nno self means no contention.\nOnly by not contending does no one under Heaven contend with them.\n\nThe ancient saying *\"Curving completes\"*—\nits essence is as such.\nKnowing how to curve and complete,\nthen one knows how to bend and straighten,\nhollow and fill,\nwear and renew.\nNot self-illuminating, hence clarity;\nnot self-affirming, hence manifest;\nnot self-praising, hence merit;\nnot self-exalting, hence longevity—\nall arise from this.\nIs this not what is meant by *complete and thus it returns*?\n\n**Chapter 23: \"Sparse Speech, Natural\"**\nA gusting wind does not last a morning,\na sudden rain does not last a day.\nWho makes this? Only Heaven and Earth.\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot endure long—\nhow much less can mortals?\n\nThus those who follow the Dao:\nthose aligned with the Dao are aligned with the Dao;\nthose aligned with virtue are aligned with virtue;\nthose aligned with loss are aligned with loss.\nAligned with the Dao, the Dao is obtained;\naligned with virtue, virtue is obtained;\naligned with loss, loss is obtained.\nFaith is insufficient, hence there is doubt.\n\nThe Classic says: *Listening yet not hearing is called sparse speech,*\nyet knowing why one speaks,\nthen speech arises from non-speech,\nand listening yet not hearing is attained—\nthus it is said: *sparse speech.*\nSparse speech is speaking in accordance with the Dao,\nthus it is said: *natural.*\n\nGusting winds and sudden rains—\ntheir completion is violent and abrupt,\nnot arising from the usual order,\nthus even Heaven and Earth cannot endure a morning or a day.\nHuman speech not arising from naturalness—\nthen much and frequent exhaustion is inevitable.\nOnly those who follow the Dao can truly have no self.\n\nNo self, then the Dao, virtue, and loss—\nI do not see how they differ,\nthus those aligned with the Dao are aligned with the Dao,\nthose aligned with virtue are aligned with virtue,\nthose aligned with loss are aligned with loss,\nand all convolutions merge into one.\n\nOnly by not seeing how they differ and aligning with them,\nthen even if they differ from me,\nthey never depart from me—\nthus it is said: *aligned with the Dao, the Dao is obtained;\naligned with virtue, virtue is obtained;\naligned with loss, loss is obtained.*\nOnly when faith is insufficient\ndo Dao, virtue, and loss differ—\nthus it is said: *faith is insufficient, hence there is doubt.*\n\n**Chapter 24: \"The Limping Do Not Stand\"**\nThe limping do not stand,\nthe straddling do not walk.\nSelf-illuminating is not clarity,\nself-affirming is not manifest,\nself-praising is without merit,\nself-exalting is not longevity.\nIn regard to the Dao, they are surplus food and encumbering steps—\nthings may detest them,\nthus those with the Dao do not dwell among them.\n\nThe Classic says: *The limping as standing is not the usual way of standing,*\nthe straddling as walking is not the usual way of walking—\nthus it cannot endure,\nso though standing, they do not stand,\nthough walking, they do not walk.\nThe Dao is inherently without self,\nwithout self means no contention,\nthen self-illuminating, self-affirming, self-exalting—\nthese are not their usual ways,\nthus in regard to the Dao, they are surplus food and encumbering steps.\n\nCommon people all crave them,\nyet I take them as well—\nthis is surplus food.\nNature is inherently without them, yet they are extravagantly indulged—\nthis is encumbering steps.\n\nExcess nourishment and burdensome actions are detested by things,\nthus those with the Dao rightly do not dwell among them.\n\nThe Dao abides where common people detest,\nyet it is said that things may detest it—\nthus why do those with the Dao not dwell there?\nIt is because the lowly, humble, yielding, and weak\nare what common people detest and abandon—\nthus those with the Dao dwell among them.\nThose who boast and vaunt themselves\nare what common people detest and contend against—\nthus they are not dwelled among.\n\nSo whether dwelling or not dwelling,\ntheir essence is the same: non-contention.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Indistinctly Formed Thing**\n\nThere is a thing indistinctly formed,\nborn before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent and boundless,\nit stands alone yet does not change,\ncirculates endlessly yet does not weary—\nit may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.\n\nI do not know its name,\nso I call it the Dao.\nForcing a name upon it, I call it Great.\n\nGreat means passing,\npassing means distant,\ndistant means returning.\nThus the Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nand the Sage-King is also Great.\n\nWithin the Four Seas, there are four Greats,\nand the Sage-King occupies one of them.\n\nHumans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nand the Dao follows the Natural Way.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThere is *qi*, there is form, there is substance—\nthus the positions of Heaven, Earth, and humans\nmay be heard, seen, and grasped,\nand the ears, eyes, and mind distinguish these things—\nyet *qi*, form, and substance have not yet been seen.\n*Qi*, form, and substance are indistinctly mingled and not yet separated,\nso when viewed, they are invisible;\nwhen listened to, they are inaudible;\nwhen grasped, they cannot be held—\nthus their form cannot be seen.\nI do not know its name,\nso I name it according to its meaning—\nthus I call it the Dao.\n\nNot knowing its name, I grasp it with the mind.\nI name it the Dao, speaking of it by its meaning.\n\nThe Dao as a thing—\nwhen used, it fills the six voids,\nbut when abandoned, its whereabouts are unknown—\nhow could \"Great\" suffice to name it?\nIt is merely a forced name.\n\nGreat means it circulates universally without exclusion,\nnot confined to my body alone—\nthus Great is called Passing.\nPassing means it moves far without resistance—\nthus Passing is called Distant.\nDistant without resistance means\nseeking its boundary yields nothing—\nreturning to its root, it never truly leaves my body—\nthus Distant is called Returning.\n\nThe Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nand the Sage-King is also Great—\noutside the Four Seas, \"Great\" is insufficient to describe it.\nThe so-called four Greats exist within the realm.\n\nThe Sage-King is the fulfillment of human Dao.\nKnowing constancy, he embraces it,\nand embracing it, he becomes public—\npublic, he becomes the Sage-King—\nthus within the realm, there are four Greats,\nand the Sage-King occupies one.\n\nThe Sage-King is the consummate expression of human Dao.\n\nHumans, with their form, align with the formless—\nEarth does the same—\nthus where Earth reaches, humans also reach—\nhence, \"Humans follow Earth.\"\nWhere Heaven reaches, Earth also reaches—\nhence, \"Earth follows Heaven.\"\nWhere the Dao reaches, Heaven also reaches—\nhence, \"Heaven follows the Dao.\"\nThe Dao is self-rooted, self-originating,\nexisting before Heaven and Earth,\neternally present since antiquity,\nand takes the Natural Way as its law.\nThe Natural Way is lawlessness—\nthus, \"The Dao follows the Natural Way.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as Light Root, the Still as Restless Sovereign**\n\nThe heavy is the root of the light,\nthe still is the sovereign of the restless.\nThus the virtuous person, though traveling all day,\nnever departs from his baggage.\nThough adorned with splendor,\nhis repose is serene and detached.\n\nHow can one who rules a thousand chariots\nlighten himself against the world?\nLightness leads to losing ministers,\nrestlessness leads to losing sovereignty.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe light is first to be moved,\nthe heavy is last to respond—\nresponse arises from being moved—\nthus the heavy is the root of the light.\nThe still commands things,\nthe restless is commanded by things—\nrestlessness is always the servant of stillness—\nthus stillness is the sovereign of the restless.\n\nTherefore, even within a day’s journey,\nthe virtuous person’s actions are measured and restrained—\nyet still, he does not depart from his baggage,\nfor lightness cannot exist without weight.\nThough adorned with splendor may suffice for comfort,\nthere is also serene repose—\nthus restlessness cannot exist without stillness.\n\nIf even daily travel and splendor require this,\nhow much more so for the ruler of a thousand chariots,\nbearing heavy burdens and distant paths,\nobserving all under Heaven—\nhow could he not be still and heavy?\n\nForced into motion, responding only when moved,\nacting only when unavoidable—\nthis is heaviness.\nDoing nothing—\nthis is stillness.\n\nIf his actions are always within his own power,\nyet he cannot refrain from doing—\nthen he lightens himself against the world without weight,\nand without weight, he is restless and not still.\n\nThus it is said:\nAbove, there is non-action,\nbelow, there is also non-action—\nthis makes below and above share the same virtue,\nand below and above sharing virtue means no submission.\nBelow has action,\nabove also has action—\nthis makes above and below share the same Dao,\nand above and below sharing the Dao means no sovereignty.\n\nFor the light takes on the labor of ministers and substitutes for them—\nif ministers do nothing and share the Dao with above,\nthey are not ministers—\nnot ministers means losing ministers.\n\nThe restless forgets the ruler’s ease and serves the world—\nif the ruler also acts, and above and below share the Dao,\nhe is not sovereign—\nnot sovereign means losing sovereignty.\n\nThus it is said:\nLightness leads to losing ministers,\nrestlessness leads to losing sovereignty.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Good Way**\n\nThe good way leaves no tracks,\ngood speech leaves no flaws,\ngood calculation does not use reckoning,\ngood closure requires no locks yet cannot be opened,\ngood binding requires no cords yet cannot be undone.\n\nThus the Sage always rescues people,\nso there are none abandoned;\nalways rescues things,\nso there are none discarded—\nthis is called following clarity.\n\nThus the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous,\nthe unvirtuous are the resources of the good.\nNot valuing one’s teacher,\nnot cherishing one’s resources—\nthough one may know, it is utter confusion—\nthis is called the essential mystery.\n\nThe Classic says:\nA chariot’s passage leaves tracks,\nA pedestrian’s steps leave footprints—\nThus movement cannot truly lack traces.\n\nKnowing how movement moves,\nMovement arises from non-movement,\nHence it is said: *Good movement leaves no tracks.*\n\nThe wise do not speak,\nThose who speak are not wise—\nThus speech cannot truly lack flaws.\n\nKnowing how speech speaks,\nSpeech arises from non-speech,\nHence it is said: *Good speech leaves no flaws.*\n\nOne and speech make two,\nTwo and one make three—\nFrom this onward, even clever reckoning cannot tally,\nOnly he who attains unity and forgets speech\nCan truly bring numbers to completion.\n\nWhen numbers are complete,\nTheir calculation cannot be exhausted,\nHence it is said: *Good calculation does not use reckoning.*\n\nThe Celestial Gate has no barrier—\nIts opening and closing lie within me.\nIf I do not open it,\nWho can force it ajar?\nHence it is said: *Good closure requires no locks yet cannot be opened.*\n\nThe world has its natural order—\nIt is bound not by cords or ropes,\nBut by following its natural state,\nHence it is said: *Good binding requires no cords yet cannot be undone.*\n\nThus, if movement does not follow this,\nMovement cannot lack traces;\nIf speech does not follow this,\nSpeech cannot lack flaws;\nIf calculation, closure, or binding do not follow this,\nThough reckoning is used, it brings chaos,\nThough locks are set, they are opened,\nThough cords are tied, they are undone—\nWhat remains within oneself\nCannot avoid decay.\nHow then can there be time to rescue people or things?\n\nOnly the Sage understands the Dao\nAnd masters these five arts,\nThus always rescues people and leaves none abandoned,\nAlways rescues things and leaves none discarded.\n\nHow so?\nThese five are the inherent principles of nature and life,\nShared by all.\nOnly the Sage, with his clarity of knowing the constant,\nRescues at the point where all share it—\nThough movement, speech, calculation, closure, and binding occur,\nNone know how it is done,\nFor his clarity is subtle and unseen,\nHence it is called *following clarity.*\n\nOnly because he excels in rescue\nIs the good person the teacher of the unvirtuous,\nAnd the unvirtuous the resources of the good.\nHow could one abandon what is unvirtuous?\nYet still—\nThose who seek the Dao forget the mind,\nThough the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous,\nI do not value my teacher,\nThough the unvirtuous are the resources of the good,\nI do not cherish my resources.\nNot valuing one’s teacher,\nNot cherishing one’s resources—\nThough wise, one remains utterly lost—\nThis is called the *essential mystery.*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic**\n\nKnow the heroic,\nHold to the receptive—\nThus you become the world’s valley.\n\nAs the world’s valley,\nYour virtue remains unchanging,\nReturning to the infant.\n\nKnow the bright,\nHold to the dark—\nThus you become the world’s model.\n\nAs the world’s model,\nYour virtue does not err,\nReturning to the boundless.\n\nKnow the honored,\nHold to the humbled—\nThus you become the world’s source.\n\nAs the world’s source,\nYour virtue is complete,\nReturning to the uncarved.\n\nThe uncarved scatters to become vessels,\nThe Sage uses it to become officials—\nThus great governance does not cut.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe heroic stirs while the receptive is still,\nThe heroic is firm while the receptive is yielding,\nThe heroic leads while the receptive responds.\n\nKnow the heroic,\nHold to the receptive—\nThus you attain deep stillness and yield,\nResponding without leading,\nHence you become the world’s valley.\n\nThe valley, as a thing,\nReceives from the mountains and flows to the seas—\nReceiving without resistance,\nFlowing without accumulation—\nA thing that communicates without obstruction,\nThus virtue remains unchanging.\n\nMan’s life,\nVirtue is internally complete,\nUnconnected to things—\nYet when swayed by things,\nDaily it grows more distant.\n\nOnly by attaining deep stillness,\nYielding and responding without leading,\nDoes virtue remain unchanging,\nReturning to the infant.\n\nBrightness in color is receiving hues,\nIn things is clarity,\nIn action is metal,\nIn numbers is four.\nDarkness in color is resisting stain,\nIn things is obscurity,\nIn action is water,\nIn numbers is one.\n\nKnow the bright,\nHold to the dark—\nNot receiving the stains of ten thousand things,\nLike obscurity, like water,\nEnding in embracing unity.\n\nEmbrace unity,\nYou can bend, you can yield,\nYou can hollow, you can decay—\nThus you can become the world’s model.\n\nAs the world’s model,\nWithout bending yet not straying from one,\nYour virtue does not err.\n\nNot straying means\nNot straying from its original place,\nYet not necessarily avoiding force—\nAvoiding force means not differing.\nThe infant, as a thing,\nFocuses qi and attains yielding,\nNever losing its one,\nIts body in harmony.\nReturning to the boundless,\nEven the infant is insufficient to describe it.\n\nGrass and trees flourish as honored,\nWither as humbled—\nMan’s honored and humbled,\nAlso such it is.\n\nKnow the honored,\nHold to the humbled,\nDiscarding ornament to return to root—\nThough covered by what the world most despises,\nIt cannot burden you,\nHence you become the world’s source.\n\nThe source, as a thing,\nEmpty yet can be filled,\nResponsive yet does not hoard—\nThe origin from which rivers and seas arise.\nTo become the world’s source,\nIs to return to its origin,\nThus virtue is complete—\nNot merely avoiding force.\n\nReturning to the uncarved,\nThe uncarved is the whole of truth,\nThe mingled origin of things—\nOnly because it is mingled and not yet shaped\nCan it be great and small,\nBend and straight,\nShort and long,\nRound and square—\nNothing it cannot become,\nThus the boundless is insufficient to describe it.\n\nYet if holding to the receptive,\nHolding to the dark,\nHolding to the humbled is enough—\nWhy bother knowing the heroic, the bright, or the honored?\nFor holding is the mother,\nKnowing is the child—\n\nThe Dao/Way as the principle,\nKnowledge as its application.\n\nWhen the uncarved scatters, it becomes things—\nThings, as objects,\nCan be great yet cannot be small,\nCan bend yet cannot straighten,\nCan shorten yet cannot lengthen,\nCan round yet cannot square—\nThus the Sage employs them only as officials and ministers,\nNot as the means to attain public virtue or kingship.\n\nIf one embraces the uncarved to govern the world,\nTheir view of the world’s order\nIs like the butcher Ding’s view of the ox—\nThey never see the whole ox,\nActing only where there is no work to be done,\nAmple indeed in their ease, with room to spare for the blade—\nWhat need is there for cutting?\n\nHence it is said: *\"The greatest governance does not cut.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Those Who Would Take the World**\nThose who would seize the world to rule it,\nI see their failure is inevitable.\n\nThe world is a divine vessel,\nNot to be forced.\n\nTo force it is to ruin it,\nTo grasp it is to lose it.\n\nThus things move or follow,\nAre offered or rejected,\nAre strong or weak,\nAre raised or toppled.\n\nTherefore the Sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids excessiveness.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe Sage embraces the uncarved to govern the world,\nThus the greatest governance does not cut—\nTheir way of taking the world is simply to do nothing.\n\nTo take is to win the world’s heart,\nTo keep it from departing.\n\nThus those who would seize the world to rule it\nAre not the way to take the world.\n\nTo take what should not be taken is why I see their failure.\n\nThat which is above form is called the Dao/Way,\nThat which is below form is called things.\n\nThe world as things is a divine vessel.\nOnly the divine Dao can govern divine things.\n\nThe Dao has no scheming,\nNo doing—\nYet if one acts for it,\nThat is not its way.\nThus it cannot be forced.\n\nTo force is to seek completion,\nYet completion only brings ruin.\nTo grasp is to seek possession,\nYet possession only brings loss.\n\nEmperor Yao did not claim superiority,\nNor did he see others as inferior.\nMajestic indeed were Shun and Yu’s rule over the world,\nYet they did not take credit—\nThis is the true way to take the world,\nNot by forcing and grasping.\n\nThus all things have movement and follow,\nHave compliance and resistance,\nHave strength and weakness,\nHave elevation and collapse—\nThe natural course of affairs cannot be otherwise.\nHow then can one force and grasp them?\n\nTherefore the Sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids excessiveness,\nSimply aiding the natural unfolding of all things—\nHow dare they interfere?\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao/Way**\nTo assist the sovereign with the Dao/Way\nIs not to use force to dominate the world—\nTheir affairs return like a boomerang.\n\nWhere the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great campaigns, there are years of famine.\nThus the virtuous act decisively yet do not boast,\nDo not vaunt their achievements,\nDo not grow arrogant,\nAct only when unavoidable,\nAnd do not seek force.\n\nThings grow strong then age—\nThis is called not the Dao.\nNot the Dao, it perishes early.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe sovereign is one of non-action.\nThe assistant is one of action.\nTo take the world cannot be without consequence,\nYet if one acts without restraint,\nTheir ruin comes from using force—\nThough the assistant acts, if not in accord with the Dao,\nHow much more so the sovereign’s non-action?\n\nThis is why their affairs return like a boomerang.\nIf one subdues the world with the Dao,\nThe world dare not refuse.\nBut if one subdues the world with force,\nThey will resist and oppose you.\n\nWhat you send out returns to you.\nWhere the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great campaigns, there are years of famine.\nThe army’s harm to the world is thus—\nThus the skilled warrior acts decisively yet does no more.\n\nDecisive means conquering the enemy.\nTo conquer the enemy—\nWhen the enemy’s attack is like a wailing wind,\nWhen their defense is like a towering rampart—\nThis is decisive.\n\nActing only when unavoidable,\nNot relying on force to dominate.\nDecisive yet not proud of ability,\nDecisive yet not boasting of victory,\nDecisive yet not arrogant in power—\nTheir decisiveness always arises from necessity—\nThis is the way of decisiveness without force.\n\nIf one is decisive yet proud of ability,\nDecisive yet boasts of victory,\nDecisive yet arrogant in power—\nThen this is decisiveness in force,\nNot decisiveness from necessity.\n\nAll things grow young then strong,\nStrong then age—\nThis is their nature.\nThe Dao values guarding softness as strength,\nThus it endures without peril.\n\nIf one uses force to dominate the world,\nThis is to abandon softness and employ strength—\nStrength must age,\nThen it is merely a thing—\nHow can this be the Dao’s way of transforming things?\n\nHence it is said:\nThings grow strong then age—\nThis is called not the Dao.\nNot the Dao, it perishes early.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: On Fine Arms**\nFine arms are an inauspicious instrument,\nThings detest and abhor them—\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\n\nThe gentleman at home values the left,\nIn war values the right.\n\nArms are an inauspicious instrument,\nNot the instrument of the gentleman—\nUsed only when unavoidable,\nWith calmness as the highest virtue.\n\nTo win yet not rejoice in it,\nYet to rejoice is to delight in killing.\n\nThose who delight in killing\nCannot achieve their desires in the world.\n\nAuspicious matters favor the left,\nInauspicious matters favor the right.\nThe left general commands the left,\nThe right general commands the right—\nSpeaking of treating war as a funeral rite.\n\nWhen many are killed, mourn with sorrowful weeping.\nWhen victorious, treat it as a funeral rite.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe cultured observe and the martial conceal—\nThis is the way of Heaven and Earth,\nThe principle of yin and yang.\n\nTo praise arms is to dwell upon the inauspicious,\nTo dwell upon what things abhor—\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\n\nTherefore the gentleman at home values the left,\nIn war values the right—\nTheir priorities differ from ordinary times,\nFor they dwell upon an inauspicious instrument,\nNot the instrument of the gentleman.\n\nIt is not that one delights in it—only when necessity compels does one employ it. Serenity and simplicity are supreme, hence victory is not glorified.\n\nIt is not that one delights in it—Heaven will save it, shielding it with benevolence. Benevolence is what Heaven delights to promote without wearying of. Then, those who kill—how could they not delight in it? Yet to glorify it is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their desires in the world.\n\nThus auspicious matters favor the left,\nInauspicious matters favor the right.\nThe left general commands the left,\nThe right general commands the right—\nSpeaking of treating war as a funeral rite.\nWhen many are killed, mourn with sorrowful weeping.\nWhen victorious, treat it as a funeral rite.\n\nIf war is treated as a funeral rite, then it is clear that this is an inauspicious instrument and not glorified.\nIf one mourns with sorrowful weeping, then it is clear that one does not delight in killing.\n\nThe Master’s understanding of ritual learning is thus, yet those who say the Master abolished ritual learning—do they truly know his intent in abolishing it?\n\n**Chapter 32: The Dao Ever Nameless**\nThe Dao ever nameless—though simple, the world dares not submit to it.\nIf lords and kings could guard it, all things would come as guests.\nHeaven and Earth unite, descending sweet dew—\nNone commands it, yet all is balanced.\nWhen naming first arose, names were established.\nThen one must know when to stop—\nKnowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.\n\nThe Dao in the world is like valleys to rivers and seas.\nThe Classic says:\n\"The Dao ever nameless—\nTo name it *the* Dao is to contradict it.\nWhen it is nameless, nothing yet exists.\nIts simplicity is truly small,\nYet the world dares not submit to it—why?\nHeaven and Earth rely on it to begin,\nAll things depend on it to live—\nWho in the world would dare to submit to their own origin and their own life?\nThis is called the True Sovereign.\nAll things have their True Sovereign—this is the meaning.\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nThey would rule all things as True Sovereigns—\nWho would have their True Sovereign and not submit?\nThus it is said:\nThe Sage acts, and all things observe.\nExtreme yin is solemn, extreme yang is radiant—\nSolemn arises from Heaven, radiant issues from Earth.\nThe two interact, forming harmony, and thus things are born.\nSome record it, yet its form is unseen.\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite to descend sweet dew,\nThis is the peak of their interaction and harmony.\nLords and kings grasp the Dao’s record, and all things submit to them—\nYet who can see its form?\nThus none commands it, yet all is balanced.\n\nThe nameless simplicity—no thought, no action.\nWhen the artisan acts, naming first arises, and names are established.\nAt this time, one must know when to stop—\nThen it is easy to hold, unmanifested is easy to plan,\nFragile is easy to shatter, subtle is easy to disperse.\nAct before it exists, govern before it is disordered—\nThen what beginning will there be?\nThis is the way lords and kings guard it.\n\nThe Dao in the world is like valleys to rivers and seas—\nCould there be anything that does not return to it?\n\n**Chapter 33: Knowing Others is Wisdom**\nKnowing others is wisdom,\nSelf-knowledge is clarity.\nOvercoming others requires strength,\nOvercoming oneself is power.\nContentment brings wealth,\nPersistent action fulfills ambition.\nNot losing what one holds ensures longevity,\nDying without perishing ensures true life.\n\nThe Classic says:\nKnowing others is wisdom, self-knowledge is clarity—\nOnly by knowing oneself can one know others,\nThus clarity is the source of wisdom.\nOvercoming others requires strength, overcoming oneself is power—\nOnly by overcoming oneself can one overcome others,\nThus power is the source of strength.\nReturning to the constant is called \"command,\"\nAnd knowing the constant is called \"clarity.\"\nUnable to know oneself, one cannot know the constant—\nThus knowing the constant is the way to know oneself.\nWhen clarity reaches self-knowledge,\nWhat more is there to knowing others?\n\nGuarding softness is strength—\nEngaging others in contention, daily battling with the heart,\nThis is not how to guard softness.\nThus guarding softness is the way to overcome oneself.\nWhen power reaches overcoming oneself,\nWhat more is there to the Sage?\n\nWith self-knowledge’s clarity,\nOne knows all things are complete within oneself,\nRequiring no external emulation—\nThus it is said: Contentment brings wealth.\nWith overcoming oneself’s power,\nOne only strives diligently in the Dao,\nSeeking nothing from others—\nThus it is said: Persistent action fulfills ambition.\nKnowing sufficiency within oneself and striving persistently,\nOne can preserve what must be preserved,\nAnd not be swayed by external things—\nThus it is said: Not losing what one holds ensures longevity.\nPreserving what must be preserved,\nEven in death, one does not perish—\nThus it is said: Dying without perishing ensures true life.\n\n**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows**\nThe Great Dao flows—\nIt can be turned left or right.\nAll things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse.\nWhen the work is done, it does not dwell upon it.\nIt clothes all things yet does not claim lordship.\nEver without desire, it may be called small;\nAll things return to it, yet it does not know lordship—\nIt may be called great.\nThus the Sage never claims greatness,\nAnd so achieves true greatness.\n\nThe Classic says:\nIt can be turned left, yet not right,\nIt can be turned right, yet not left—\nIn things, one-sidedness is not the Great Dao.\nThe Great Dao is present everywhere,\nThus it flows—it can be turned left or right.\nWhatever is great cannot be called small,\nSmall cannot be called great.\nThis Dao, because it can be turned left or right,\nThus all things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse.\nWhen the work is done, it does not dwell upon it,\nIt clothes all things yet does not claim lordship.\nOnly because it does not dwell, does not claim lordship,\nIs it ever without desire.\nEver without desire is the pinnacle of subtlety,\nThus it may be called small.\n\nAll things return to it yet know no lord—\nThus it is the utmost in receptivity,\nAnd so may be called great.\n\nThough great, it may still be called small,\nYet if small, it may still be called great—\nNeither great nor small,\nThis is why the Dao hides in the Nameless.\n\nYet truly, the Dao’s greatness lies not in being great.\nThe Sage embodies the Dao,\nAnd so his ability to achieve greatness\nDoes not come from himself.\n\n**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**\n\nGrasp the Great Symbol, and all under heaven will come.\nCome, yet cause no harm—\nPeace, security, and ease prevail.\nDelight in bait, and travelers will stop.\n\nThe Dao spoken of is insipid, without taste.\nLook upon it, and it cannot be seen;\nListen to it, and it cannot be heard;\nUse it, and it cannot be exhausted.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the seas—\nAll things return to it yet know no lord,\nThis is formlessness.\nFormlessness is the Great Symbol—\nWho then could preserve themselves and not follow?\n\nThus it is said: Grasp the Great Symbol, and all under heaven will come.\nIf one loses the Dao and all under heaven comes,\nThen depart—\nYet even then, their coming will cause harm.\nIf one holds to the Dao and all under heaven comes,\nThough they forget themselves in its unfolding,\nThey will never truly separate—\nThus they come without harm, in peace, security, and ease.\n\nPeace is the utmost of security,\nEase is the utmost of peace.\nIf there is delight to be delighted in,\nIf there is bait to be craved,\nThen those who stop are but passing travelers.\n\nThe Dao spoken of is insipid, its essence pure—\nNot bait to be craved;\nLook upon it, and it cannot be seen;\nListen to it, and it cannot be heard—\nNot delight to be delighted in.\nIf such is the case, how could it be exhausted?\nTravelers stop, yet it is but a thatched hut for them—\nNot something to be endured long.\nThat it cannot be exhausted is why the people use it daily without knowing,\nAnd peace, security, and ease arise from it—\nHow much more than mere travelers stopping?\n\n**Chapter 36: The Chapter of Welcoming and Withdrawing**\n\nTo those who would gather, first spread wide;\nTo those who would weaken, first strengthen;\nTo those who would destroy, first nurture;\nTo those who would take, first give.\n\nThis is called subtle clarity.\nThe soft overcomes the hard—\nFish cannot escape the depths,\nAnd the sharpest tools of a state\nMust not be shown to others.\n\nThe Classic says:\nTo those who would gather, first spread wide;\nTo those who would weaken, first strengthen;\nTo those who would destroy, first nurture;\nTo those who would take, first give.\n\nThe Way of Heaven, the nature of things,\nThe affairs of humankind—\nTheir momentum has never been otherwise.\nFrom strength, know withdrawal;\nFrom hardness, know softness;\nFrom flourishing, know decay;\nFrom giving, know taking.\nWho but the wise in omens could comprehend this?\n\nThus it is said: This is called subtle clarity.\nYet those who can gather, spread, weaken, strengthen,\nDestroy, nurture, take, and give—\nAre formless and soft.\nWhat they gather, spread, weaken, strengthen,\nDestroy, nurture, take, and give—\nAre formed and hard.\nThus the victory of soft over hard is clear.\n\nHumans cannot depart from softness,\nJust as fish cannot escape the depths.\nFish escaping the depths are caught—\nHumans departing from softness are but doomed to death.\n\nThe utmost softness in the world\nRanges over the utmost hardness,\nYet nothing enters the unquestioned.\nRanging over the utmost hardness while entering the unquestioned—\nThis is the sharpest of tools.\nTo wield sharp tools in governing the world and states,\nOne’s schemes must always lie in the formless realm—\nHow could one make others know their origin?\n\nThus it is said: The sharpest tools of a state\nMust not be shown to others.\n\n**Chapter 37: The Dao Ever Uncarved**\n\nThe Dao ever does without doing, yet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nAll things would transform of themselves.\nWhen transformation stirs to act,\nI will restrain it with the Uncarved Primordial.\n\nThe Uncarved Primordial will then desire nothing.\nDesiring nothing, it remains still—\nAll under heaven will align of itself.\n\nThe Classic says:\nAll things have names,\nYet the Dao is ever nameless—\nThus named things are all its guests.\nHence it is said: All things will align as guests,\nAnd this is spoken of through the Nameless.\n\nStill, this is but knowing non-action.\nNon-action yet nothing remains undone—\nThen there is no true non-action.\nThus all things transform of themselves.\nWhen they transform, I and all things are none but the Dao—\nWho knows the guests and their hosting?\n\nThus when they align as guests,\nNames are first established.\nNames once established,\nThey will know when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop,\nThey return to the Uncarved Primordial.\n\nWhen they transform and stir to act,\nI will restrain them with the Uncarved Primordial—\nYet the Uncarved Primordial itself will desire nothing.\nThe Uncarved Primordial desires nothing—\nThis is not merely non-action,\nNor has there ever been true non-action.\n\nAll movement under heaven\nIs but the rectification of the One.\nIf lords and kings guard the Dao to this extent,\nThey may be said to desire nothing and remain still—\nHow could all under heaven fail to align?\n\nThe Old Master was truly a sage,\nYet why did he not tirelessly attend to all things under heaven,\nBut instead exhort lords and kings with such earnestness?\nThe Dao, when cultivated for oneself, is true;\nWhen cultivated for all under heaven, it is universal.\nIf lords and kings know and guard it,\nThen cultivating for all under heaven is truly universal.\n\nTo proclaim the Dao without sound\nYet wish to harmonize with all under heaven—this is benevolence.\nTo wish to harmonize with all under heaven\nYet first instruct lords and kings—this is righteousness.\n\nYet scholars, seeing his words as utterly rejecting and abandoning propriety and righteousness, say, *\"The Old Master tramples upon and belittles my benevolence and righteousness—I do not accept this.\"* Alas, they do not perceive the intent behind his rejection, so it is fitting that they reject it.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: On the Virtue of the Highest Virtue Not Being Virtue**\n\nThe highest virtue does not act as virtue,\nAnd thus it truly is virtue.\nThe lower virtue clings to virtue,\nAnd thus it is not virtue.\n\nThe highest virtue acts without contrivance,\nAnd yet there is nothing to contrive.\nThe lower virtue acts with contrivance,\nAnd thus there is much to contrive.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts without contrivance,\nAnd yet there is nothing to contrive.\nThe highest righteousness acts with contrivance,\nAnd thus there is much to contrive.\n\nThe highest ritual acts with contrivance,\nYet none respond—\nThen it raises its arm and forces compliance.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises.\n\nRitual is but the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\nPrescience is but the flower of the Dao,\nAnd the start of folly.\n\nTherefore, the true sage abides in the thick, not the thin,\nIn the real, not the superficial—\nThus he discards the latter and embraces the former.\n\nThe transmission says:\n*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao—*\nThen how could the common man possess it?\n\nThe highest virtue, by having no gain, attains gain.\nOnly because it has no gain\nIs it able to attain gain—\nThus it is said: *The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus it truly is virtue.*\n\nThe lower virtue, by not losing virtue, attains gain.\nOnly because it does not lose virtue\nDoes it, though gaining, lack true virtue—\nThus it is said: *The lower virtue clings to virtue, and thus it is not virtue.*\n\nThe highest virtue acts without contrivance,\nNot because it deliberately avoids action,\nBut because virtue’s own nature spontaneously requires nothing.\n\nThe lower virtue does not understand this,\nAnd thus must contrive—\nHence, it cannot avoid contrivance.\n\nVirtue, by requiring nothing, is sufficient.\nYet if benevolence is added,\nThen it is contrived.\n\nBut the highest benevolence, in its benevolence,\nRequires no transformation—\nThus it acts without contrivance.\n\nBenevolence cannot stand alone,\nAnd thus righteousness must be present.\nEven the highest righteousness cannot avoid action—\nThus it acts with contrivance.\n\nBenevolence is merely giving,\nBut righteousness chooses what is fitting to give,\nWithout demanding reciprocity.\n\nRitual demands reciprocity—\nTo receive without giving is not ritual,\nTo give without receiving is also not ritual.\nThis is the principle of ritual.\n\nThe highest ritual acts with contrivance,\nYet none respond—\nThen it raises its arm and forces compliance,\nFor though they do not respond,\nIt still does not abandon ritual to enforce ritual—\nSuch is the natural order.\n\nThe highest benevolence, highest righteousness, and highest ritual are thus—\nThen what of their lesser counterparts? It is self-evident.\n\nFrom this, we see:\nWhen the Dao is lost, virtue arises;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises—\nIs this not the truth?\n\nRitual’s demands for reciprocity are so great\nThat loyalty and trust grow thin,\nAnd contention begins—\nThus, though ritual is meant to govern chaos,\nIt is also the source of chaos.\n\nPrescience, though it employs wisdom,\nIs the beginning of folly.\n\nWhy is this?\nHuman governance arises from substance,\nSubstance is nature,\nThinness is artifice—\nTo abandon nature for artifice\nIs to invite chaos.\n\nHuman self-awareness lies in clarity,\nClarity reveals the real,\nWisdom is but its flower—\nTo abandon the real for the superficial\nIs to invite folly.\n\nThus, the true sage abides in the thick, not the thin,\nIn the real, not the superficial—\nAnd so he forgets benevolence and righteousness,\nDiscards ritual and learning,\nAbandons wisdom,\nAnd aspires to the complete Dao of virtue—\nThis is called discarding the latter and embracing the former.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: On the Ancient Possession of the One**\n\nThose who in ancient times possessed the One—\nThe heavens, by possessing the One, were clear;\nThe earth, by possessing the One, was tranquil;\nThe spirit, by possessing the One, was numinous;\nThe valleys, by possessing the One, were full;\nAll things, by possessing the One, lived;\nLords and kings, by possessing the One, were steadfast for all under heaven.\n\nIf the heavens did not possess the One, they would crack;\nIf the earth did not possess the One, it would erupt;\nIf the spirit did not possess the One, it would perish;\nIf the valleys did not possess the One, they would dry;\nIf all things did not possess the One, they would die;\nIf lords and kings did not possess the One, their nobility would falter.\n\nThus, nobility relies on humility as its root,\nAnd height relies on lowliness as its foundation.\nHence, lords and kings call themselves *\"lonely, few, and unworthy\"*—\nIs this not taking humility as root?\n\nIs it not so?\n\nThus, true honor comes without praise,\nAnd one does not desire to be polished like jade\nOr rough like stone.\n\nThe transmission says:\n*The Dao is singular—*\nYet to possess it is to separate from it,\nAnd thus it is no longer one.\n\nOnly by possessing it without possessing it\nIs it called possessing the One.\n\nThose who in ancient times possessed the One\nWere all thus.\n\nTo look upward, the heavens—\nBy possessing the One, they were clear,\nAnd thus they cover all without tipping.\n\nTo look downward, the earth—\nBy possessing the One, they were tranquil,\nAnd thus they bear all without sinking.\n\nThe spirit is formless and utterly still—\nBy possessing the One, it is wondrously alive and numinous.\n\nThe valleys are form-filled yet utterly empty—\nBy possessing the One, they respond to stimuli and are full.\n\nAll things, in their multitude—\nBy possessing the One, they live without end.\n\nThe most exalted, the lords and kings—\nBy possessing the One, they govern all movement under heaven and remain steadfast.\n\nThus, the One is what the heavens rely upon to be clear,\nWhat the earth relies upon to be tranquil,\nWhat stillness relies upon to be numinous,\nWhat emptiness relies upon to be full,\nWhat all things rely upon to live,\nAnd what lords and kings rely upon to be steadfast for all under heaven.\n\nIf the heavens did not possess the One, they would crack;\nIf the earth did not possess the One, it would erupt;\nIf the spirit did not possess the One, it would perish;\nIf the valleys did not possess the One, they would dry;\nIf all things did not possess the One, they would die;\nAnd if lords and kings did not possess the One,\nYet only valued nobility and height—\nDo they not know that this would lead to ruin?\n\nThus, the noble relies on the lowly as its foundation,\nYet without this foundation, there is no nobility—\nFor this is how nobility establishes itself.\n\nThe lofty relies on the low as its base,\nYet without this base, there is no height—\nFor this is how height arises.\n\nThen, if one is noble yet lacks true nobility,\nOr lofty yet lacks true height—\nIs this not how lords and kings remain steadfast for all under heaven without ruin?\n\nThus, the solitary, the orphaned, the childless—\nThough detested and held in contempt by people,\nThose who claim nobility and height do so\nBecause their foundation lies here.\n\nTherefore, when one attains the utmost and exhausts it,\nReaching the One,\nThen nobility does not differ from lowliness,\nAnd lowliness does not depart from height—\nAnd praise arises from the absence of praise.\n\nWhen praise lacks distinction, then slander lacks distinction.\nWhen praise lacks distinction, it cannot be attained as nobility;\nWhen slander lacks distinction, it cannot be attained as lowliness.\nJade is valued, so it is polished green;\nStone is despised, so it is cast aside.\nYet if one does not polish it green like jade,\nOr cast it aside like stone—\nThen nobility and lowliness cannot be distinguished.\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Movement of Dao in Reversal**\nThe movement of Dao lies in reversal;\nIts use lies in weakness.\n\nAll things under heaven are born of *You* (having),\nAnd *You* is born of *Wu* (non-being).\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Dao circulates through all things, not ceasing to move,\nYet its motion ever lies in reversal—\nThis is called the pivot finding its central pivot,\nResponding to the boundless.\"*\n\nIt moves through heaven and earth, not without strength,\nYet its use ever lies in weakness—\nThis is called the utmost softness traversing the utmost firmness,\nWith nothing entering the unyielding.\n\nThus, all things under heaven are born of *You*,\nAnd *You* is born of *Wu*.\nOnly *You* can give birth to all things under heaven,\nAnd *Wu* can give birth to all *You*—\nTherefore, the movement of Dao lies in reversal,\nAnd its use lies in weakness—this is now clear.\n\nThus, to reverse and to weaken is no other thing\nThan to attain the One and exhaust it in *Wu*.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Man Hears the Dao**\n\nThe superior man hears the Dao and diligently practices it;\nThe middle man hears the Dao and holds it as if it were there, as if it were not;\nThe inferior man hears the Dao and laughs greatly—\nFor if he did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.\n\nThe ancient sayings state:\n*\"The bright Dao seems obscure,\nAdvancing in the Dao seems like retreating,\nLeveling in the Dao seems like disorder,\nThe highest virtue seems like a valley,\nThe greatest whiteness seems like a stain,\nThe broadest virtue seems insufficient,\nEstablishing virtue seems like theft,\nTrue simplicity seems corrupted,\nThe greatest square has no corners,\nThe greatest vessel is fashioned late,\nThe greatest sound is faint,\nThe greatest form is shapeless,\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless.\"*\n\nOnly the Dao is good at lending and completing.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Confucius said: If one hears the Dao in the morning,\nOne may die in the evening—it is enough.\"*\n\nThus, for those who hear the Dao, life and death cannot weigh upon their hearts—\nHow could they merely know it superficially?\n\nThe superior man hears the Dao—\nTruly hearing it, he has no further doubt,\nOnly moving and acting upon it.\n\nHow does the Dao move and act?\nBy daily observing the heart to align with what is heard—\nThis is called diligent practice.\n\nThe middle man hears the Dao—\nHe hears it yet does not fully grasp it,\nThus, it seems present, then absent.\nIf it seems present, then absent,\nHe cannot diligently practice it—\nHe merely emerges and withdraws.\n\nThe inferior man hears the Dao—\nHe hears it yet does not believe it,\nThus, he laughs greatly.\nHe laughs greatly because he seeks it with his emotions and finds nothing.\nIf the Dao could be sought with emotions, he would not laugh—\nThus, it is said: *\"If he does not laugh, it is not the Dao.\"*\n\nAs the ancients said,\nAll these cannot be sought with emotions—\nIn the murky depths, one alone sees clarity,\nIn the silence, one alone hears harmony—\nThis is called *\"the bright Dao seems obscure.\"*\n\nHarmonizing with right and wrong,\nResting in the balance of heaven,\nNothing is contrary, nothing is impossible—\nThis is called *\"leveling in the Dao seems like disorder.\"*\n\nPracticing the Dao daily,\nDiminishing, diminishing again,\nUntil reaching *Wuwei* (non-action)—\nThis is called *\"advancing in the Dao seems like retreating.\"*\n\nThe highest virtue is *Wuwei* yet without striving—\nYet its response is swift, like an echo—\nIs this not like a valley?\n\nThe greatest whiteness is pure, without blemish—\nYet it receives all the filth of the world—\nIs this not like a stain?\n\nThe broadest virtue encompasses all without limit—\nYet it never boasts, never asserts itself—\nIs this not like insufficiency?\n\nThe one who well establishes virtue does not uproot—\nYet establishes it with the constant *Wu* (non-being),\nNot with fixed certainty—\nThus, it is said: *\"Establishing virtue seems like theft.\"*\n\nEmbodying nature, embracing spirit,\nMoving through the world’s concerns without being startled—\nThus, it is said: *\"True simplicity seems corrupted.\"*\n\nThe greatest square has no fixed orientation—\nSouth and north dissolve, boundaries vanish,\nSinking into the unfathomable,\nEast and west begin in the primordial darkness,\nReturning to the great openness—\nThis is the *\"great square having no corners.\"*\n\nThe greatest vessel seems incomplete—\nYet daily calculations find it lacking,\nAnnual calculations find it abundant—\nThis is the *\"great vessel fashioned late.\"*\n\nThe greatest sound is inaudible when heard—\nThus, it is faint in voice.\nThe greatest form is invisible when seen—\nThus, it is shapeless.\n\nAll these are the Dao.\nYet calling it bright seems obscure,\nCalling it level seems like disorder,\nCalling it advancing seems like retreating—\nDown to the sound being faint, the form being shapeless—\nName and reality are ever as opposites,\nThus, the Dao is hidden in the nameless,\nAnd when named, it is ever as opposites.\n\nOnly the Dao can be thus—\nTherefore, it is good at lending and completing.\nIt gives to others, yet the more it gives, the more it possesses;\nIt nurtures and rears, lengthens and matures, completes and ripens, nourishes and shelters—\nAll this is the Dao.\nThus, it is said: *\"Only the Dao is good at lending and completing.\"*\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: Dao Gives Birth to the One**\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: The Supreme Softness of the Dao**\n\nThe Dao gives birth to One,\nOne gives birth to Two,\nTwo gives birth to Three,\nThree gives birth to the myriad things.\n\nThe myriad things bear yin upon their backs and embrace yang within,\nTheir harmony comes from the interplay of *chong* and *qi*.\nWhat people detest—\nThe solitary, the childless, the barren—\nAre the titles of kings and lords.\n\nThus, things sometimes benefit by loss,\nAnd are harmed by gain.\nWhat people teach,\nIs also what I teach as *yi*.\nThe strong and violent\nShall not meet their end.\nI shall take this as my teacher.\n\nThe Classic says:\nIn the world, there is none that can pair with the Dao,\nAnd if none can pair with it, then it is One alone.\nThus, it is said: *The Dao gives birth to One.*\nOnce called One,\nThen the naming and the named become Two—\nThus, it is said: *One gives birth to Two.*\nWhen there is One and Two,\nThen there is Three—\nThus, it is said: *Two gives birth to Three.*\nTherefore, only the nameless is complete;\nIf named as One,\nThen it reaches as far as Three,\nAnd Three established, the myriad things are born—\nThus, it is said: *Three gives birth to the myriad things.*\n\nThe hidden and unfathomable—\nThis is yin.\nThe bright and visible—\nThis is yang.\nAll that is born\nTurns its back to the hidden, unfathomable yin,\nAnd faces the bright, visible yang—\nThus, it is said: *The myriad things bear yin upon their backs and embrace yang within.*\nTo bear is to turn away,\nTo embrace is to face.\n\nYet, it must be the interplay of *chong* and *qi* to bring harmony.\nFor yin and yang are Two,\nAnd *chong* and *qi* are One—\nWithout this One, nothing could be born.\nThus, what people desire—\nAre carriages, caps, wealth, and nobility—\nYet what they detest—\nAre solitude, childlessness, and barrenness.\nWhen carriages and caps adorn the body,\nThey are not one’s nature and life,\nBut things that come and go like transient guests—\nYet if one clings to them as if they were permanent,\nThen one clings to yang and forgets to return to yin,\nThe most extreme case.\n\nThe ancients established names,\nUsing what people detest as the titles of kings and lords,\nSo that the noble would not forget the lowly,\nThe high would not forget the low,\nThat one would know what to bear and what to embrace,\nWhat to face and what to return to—\nAll to avoid losing the harmony of *chong* and One.\n\nThus, things sometimes benefit by loss,\nAnd are harmed by gain.\nFullness invites ruin,\nHumility invites increase—\nThis is the Way of Heaven.\n\nWhat people teach,\nIs also what I teach as *yi*.\nWhat I teach is the Dao—\nTo teach without *yi* is not the Dao.\n\nOnly those who align with the Dao attain One,\nAttain One, and there is no self.\nNo self, no striving.\nOnly those who do not strive\nCannot be contended with by the world—\nThe opposite leads only to death.\n\nThe noble’s teaching of others,\nThough sometimes differing,\nYet all return to One and no self—\nThis is where teaching originates.\nThus, it is said: *The strong and violent shall not meet their end.*\nI shall take this as my teacher.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The Supreme Softness in the World**\n\nThe supreme softness in the world\nDrives and conquers the supreme firmness in the world.\nThere is nothing that cannot enter where there is no gap—\nThus, I know the benefits of *wuwei*.\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid,\nThe benefits of *wuwei*—\nFew in the world can attain them.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe supreme softness in the world\nDrives and conquers the supreme firmness in the world—\nObserving things, water is such.\nThere is nothing that cannot enter where there is no gap—\nObserving things, *qi* is such.\n\nWater, through its softness and weakness,\nApproaches the Dao,\nYet it cannot be without form—\nStill, it can attack the firm and strong,\nAnd none can surpass it.\n\n*Qi*, through its lack of substance,\nAligns with the spirit,\nYet it cannot be without *qi*—\nStill, it can enter where there is no gap.\nHow much more so the supreme softness,\nThe *Taiyi* before *qi* took form—\nWith this, it drives and conquers the supreme firmness,\nAnd enters where there is no gap—\nWho would not be moved?\nAnd who would not find their own way?\n\nThus, it is said: *I know the benefits of wuwei.*\nYet the teaching of the unsaid,\nThe benefits of *wuwei*—\nFew in the world can attain them,\nFor they do not know how to return to their origin.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: The Great Fullness as if Deficient**\n\nThe great fullness seems as if deficient,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nThe great excess seems as if empty,\nYet its use is unending.\nThe greatest straightness seems as if bent,\nThe greatest skill seems as if clumsy,\nThe greatest eloquence seems as if tongue-tied.\n\nThe restless overcomes cold,\nThe tranquil overcomes heat,\nThe clear and tranquil are the rectification of the world.\n\nThe Classic says:\nAll things begin here and end here—\nThis is the great fullness.\nYet it begins with no beginning,\nEnds with no end,\nThus, it seems as if deficient.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: The Great Fullness as if Deficient (Continued)**\n\nIt is because of its apparent deficiency that its use renews daily without exhaustion.\nAll things draw from it yet are never depleted—this is the great fullness.\nYet when added to, it does not grow more abundant, hence its emptiness.\nIt is because of its emptiness that its use is ever-sufficient without end.\n\nThe greatest straightness bends to preserve itself,\nAnd what is bent is made straight—\nThus, it seems as if crooked.\nThe greatest skill carves myriad forms yet does not flaunt its art—\nThus, it seems as if clumsy.\nThe greatest eloquence speaks without words—\nThus, it seems as if tongue-tied.\nSo it is—no other reason—\nFor all things have their root.\n\nWhat is this root?\nNow, cold and heat are what Heaven and Earth produce,\nWhat all things cannot escape,\nYet a single surge of agitation can overcome cold,\nAnd a single moment of stillness can overcome heat.\nIf such fleeting agitation and tranquility\nCan prevail over Heaven and Earth’s workings,\nThen how much more so\nThe body’s natural stillness and clarity,\nWhich rectify the world—\nWhere would it not triumph?\n\nThus, when speaking of its completion,\nIt seems deficient yet never exhausted;\nWhen speaking of its fullness,\nIt seems empty yet never depleted.\nIts straightness bends yet extends,\nIts skill seems clumsy yet is refined,\nIts eloquence seems stammering yet is clear—\nThis is called having root.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: The World in Harmony**\n\nWhen the Way prevails in the world,\nWarhorses are driven back to manure.\nWhen the Way is lost in the world,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo crime is greater than desiring what is desirable,\nNo calamity greater than not knowing sufficiency,\nNo fault greater than seeking to obtain.\nThus, he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\nThe Classic says:\nWhen the Way prevails in the world,\nThe people’s wisdom and skill are confined to tilling and eating,\nWhile theft and strife vanish in the absence of desire—\nAnd their deaths are as natural as shedding old skin.\nThus, it is said: *\"Warhorses are driven back to manure.\"*\n\nWhen the Way is lost in the world,\nDesire for what is desirable becomes the root of warfare,\nAnd even borders cannot secure peace—\nThus, it is said: *\"Warhorses breed in the suburbs.\"*\n\nThen whence do crimes arise?\nFrom desiring what is desirable—\nHence, *\"No crime is greater than desiring what is desirable.\"*\n\nBecause of desiring what is desirable,\nOne does not know sufficiency,\nAnd though there is abundance, one does not cease—\nModeration brings blessing, excess brings ruin.\nHence, *\"No calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency.\"*\n\nBecause of not knowing sufficiency,\nOne seeks to obtain,\nAnd when desire is fulfilled,\nResentment and blame are invited,\nAnd war never ends—\nHence, *\"No fault is greater than seeking to obtain.\"*\n\nThus, the one who does not know sufficiency,\nThough abundant, is never satisfied—\nBut he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven: The Unseen Knowing**\n\nWithout stepping outside,\nOne knows the world;\nWithout peering through windows,\nOne sees the Way of Heaven.\n\nThe farther one goes,\nThe less one knows.\nThus, the Sage acts without moving yet knows,\nSees without looking yet names,\nAccomplishes without doing.\n\nThe Classic says:\nWhat is it that makes the world the world?\nTo know how the world becomes the world,\nOne need not step outside to know it.\nWhat is it that makes the Way of Heaven the Way of Heaven?\nTo see how the Way of Heaven becomes the Way of Heaven,\nOne need not peer through windows to see it.\n\nNow, the world is vast and boundless—\nIf one waits to go out before knowing it,\nHow few will be the places one’s strength can reach,\nAnd how little will one truly know?\nThe Way of Heaven is distant and unfathomable—\nIf one waits to peer before seeing it,\nHow few will be the sights one’s eyes can grasp,\nAnd how little will one truly see?\n\nThus, it is said:\n*The farther one goes, the less one knows.*\n\nTherefore, the Sage knows how the world becomes the world,\nAnd so acts without moving yet knows;\nSees how the Way of Heaven becomes the Way of Heaven,\nAnd so names without looking.\nWhy?\nBecause it is already complete within.\n\nTo know what cannot be traveled,\nTo name what cannot be seen,\nIs to accomplish without doing.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight: The Learning of the Way**\n\nLearning increases daily,\nThe Way decreases daily.\nDecrease it again and again,\nUntil one reaches *wuwei*—\nAnd in *wuwei*, nothing remains undone.\n\nThus, to take the world is always through non-action,\nYet when action arises,\nIt is insufficient to take the world.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe learner has not yet heard the Way,\nAnd in seeking it, cannot avoid striving—\nHence, *\"increase.\"*\nThe one who practices the Way has already heard it,\nAnd in practicing, aims only at *wuwei*—\nHence, *\"decrease.\"*\n\nYet even in decreasing, one is not free of action,\nSo decrease the very act of decreasing,\nAnd only then does one reach *wuwei*.\n*Wuwei* is simply being without contrivance.\nTo do without doing is to transcend all lack—\nThis is called *\"abandoning learning, free of care.\"*\n\nFree of care is called *shen*—\n*Shen* is that which nurtures all things yet is not a thing—\nThen what need has it of the world?\nFrom this perspective,\nTo take the world is always through non-action,\nYet when action arises,\nIt is insufficient to take the world.\n\nObserve how Zhuang Zhou responded to emperors and kings,\nAnd through deep inquiry, this may be understood.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage’s Heart**\n\nThe Sage has no fixed heart,\nTaking the hearts of the people as his own.\nThe good, I treat as good;\nThe ungood, I also treat as good—\nThus, virtue is good.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nThus, virtue is trust.\n\nThe Sage in the world\nMurmurs softly, blending the hearts of the people.\nAll the people turn their ears and eyes toward him,\nAnd the Sage treats them as children.\n\nThe Classic says:\nIs the human heart so divine?\nHold it, and it exists;\nRelease it, and it vanishes.\nIt enters and exits without measure,\nAnd none can trace its path.\nTo hold it is to preserve it,\nTo release it is to lose it—\nThus, it has no fixed form to measure.\nIt enters and exits without time,\nAnd cannot be sought in past or future—\nThus, it cannot be confined to a place.\nIf the heart is so,\nThen the human heart is likewise.\n\nThe Sage first attains the exhaustion of my heart,\nThus he has no fixed heart,\nBut takes the hearts of the people as his own—\nLike a mirror with no fixed form,\nYet taking the forms of all it reflects as its own.\n\nThus, when the Sage views his own heart,\nHe views the hearts of the people in the same way—\nThen how could there be any fixed distinction\nBetween good and ungood, trust and untrust?\n\nTherefore, the good I treat as good,\nThe ungood I also treat as good—\nKnowing that their hearts’ good and ungood are without constancy,\nYet acting with virtue as good.\n\nThe trustworthy I trust,\nThe untrustworthy I also trust—\nKnowing that their hearts’ trust and untrust are without constancy,\nYet acting with virtue as trust.\n\nWhen things attain the power to generate life, it is called *virtue*;\nWhen form and body preserve the spirit, each abiding by its proper measure, it is called *nature*.\n\nWhen *nature* is cultivated and returns to *virtue*,\nAnd *virtue* reaches the state of its origin,\nThen *virtue* is what *nature* itself produces—\nThus, the absence of ungood and untrust is clearly evident.\n\nThe Sage in the world\nFlutters ceaselessly, blending the hearts of the people.\nTo blend their hearts means\nTo let the trustworthy and good not regard themselves as different,\nAnd to let the ungood and untrustworthy not abandon themselves.\n\nAll the people turn their ears and eyes toward him,\nFollowing only the Sage’s vision and hearing,\nAnd the Sage treats them as children.\n\nTo treat them as children means\nTo meet them with kindness,\nTo regard them with generosity—\nEven if they are ungood and untrustworthy,\nYet still treating them as good and trustworthy,\nKnowing that their hearts are without constancy, just as his own.\n\n**Chapter Fifty: The Chapter of Birth and Death**\nBirth and death—\nThere are thirteen aspects of birth,\nAnd thirteen aspects of death.\nHuman life is but a movement toward death.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause life’s abundance is the cause of death.\n\nIt is said that those skilled in nurturing life\nWalk upon land yet meet no rhinoceros or tiger,\nEnter battle yet are not struck by weapons.\n\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nThe tiger no place to strike with its claws,\nWeapons no place to lodge their blades.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no place of death for them.\n\nThe transmission says:\nThose who live are but companions of death,\nThose who die are the beginning of life—\nThus life and death are but interdependent, entering and exiting one another.\n\nThe thirteen aspects of life’s companionship\nCome from life yielding life—\nNot a matter of fortunate birth.\n\nThe thirteen aspects of death’s companionship\nCome from death yielding death—\nNot a matter of unfortunate demise.\n\nWhen people move toward death’s thirteen aspects,\nThe leopard nourishes within while the tiger devours without,\nThe strong nourish without while illness assaults within—\nNot because they do not value life,\nBut because they fail to grasp the Dao,\nAnd thus move toward death’s domain.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause their life is too abundant.\n\nThose who obtain life through life,\nAnd death through death—\nThis need not be discussed.\nBut those who cling to life\nAnd yet fall into death’s domain—\nTheir error lies here.\n\nIt is said that those skilled in nurturing life\nWalk upon land yet meet no rhinoceros or tiger,\nEnter battle yet are not struck by weapons.\n\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nThe tiger no place to strike with its claws,\nWeapons no place to lodge their blades.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no place of death for them.\n\nLaozi’s words on this matter are profound yet seem paradoxical,\nSpoken to provoke doubt, heard to question—\nWhy so?\n\nIs this what Zhuangzi called \"weighty words\"?\n\nLet us examine it:\n\nThe reason people encounter tigers and rhinoceroses,\nOr are struck by weapons,\nAnd why tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons can harm—\nIs because of the self.\n\nNow, if I examine my heart and find no fixed abode,\nThen my heart is unattainable.\nIf my heart is unattainable,\nThen my body and the world are also unattainable.\nWithin, I see no self;\nWithout, I see no things—\nThen who or what is the place of death?\n\nWho or what are the tiger, rhinoceros, and weapons\nTo thrust their horns, strike with claws, or lodge their blades?\n\nThen, if one is skilled in nurturing life—\nWhat more could be added to this?\n\n**Chapter Fifty: \"The Dao Gives Birth\"**\n\nThe Dao gives birth to it,\nVirtue nurtures it,\nThings shape it,\nCircumstances complete it—\nThus all things do not fail to honor the Dao and hold virtue dear.\n\nThe Dao’s honor, virtue’s nobility—\nNone bestow them, yet they abide naturally.\n\nThus the Dao gives birth, nurtures, rears, completes, matures, and shelters.\nIt gives birth yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely,\nNurtures yet does not dominate—\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nThe Classic says:\nAll things’ birth stems from the Nameless,\nYet their nurturing abides in the One, still unformed,\nAt the moment when things gain life.\nThe Nameless is the Dao.\nThe One, still unformed, yet giving life—this is virtue.\n\nWhen they become things, they are merely shaped,\nNot the source of their birth and nurturing.\nOnce formed, the naked must remain naked,\nThe scaly, the shelled, the feathered, the furred—\nEach must be scaly, shelled, feathered, or furred,\nAnd from youth to old age and death—\nAll this is the inevitable unfolding of circumstances.\nThus it is said:\n*The Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures, things shape, circumstances complete.*\n\nYet circumstances arise from form,\nForm from virtue,\nVirtue from the Dao.\nThe Dao and virtue are the root;\nForm and circumstances are the branches.\nThe root is honored, the branches lowly;\nThe root is noble, the branches base—\nThus all things do not fail to honor the Dao and hold virtue dear.\n\nThe Dao’s honor, virtue’s nobility—\nNone bestow them, yet they abide naturally.\nThis is how the uncarved block’s softness and weakness\nCan overcome the rigidity and strength of form and circumstances—\nThus kings and lords transform the world\nNot through this, but through that.\n\nThough it is said:\n*The Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures, things shape, circumstances complete,*\nWhen speaking of the root,\nTo give birth, to nurture, to rear, to complete, to mature, to shelter—\nAll are the Dao.\nYet the Dao remains nameless,\nThus it is said:\n*It gives birth yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely,\nNurtures yet does not dominate—\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: \"The Origin of the World\"**\n\nThe world has its origin,\nWhich becomes the world’s mother.\nHaving obtained its mother,\nOne knows its children;\nHaving known its children,\nOne returns to guard its mother—\nAnd thus the body perishes not.\n\nClose the senses’ openings,\nShut the gates—\nAnd one’s life is never weary.\nOpen the senses’ openings,\nPursue affairs—\nAnd one’s life is never saved.\n\nTo see what is small is called clarity;\nTo hold fast to softness is called strength.\nUsing its radiance,\nThen returning to its clarity—\nNo calamity befalls the body—\nThis is called *Clinging to the Constant.*\n\nThe Classic says:\n*The world has its origin, which becomes the world’s mother—*\nThis is what the Classic calls *\"The Dao, whose name I do not know.\"*\n\nThe Nameless is the origin of heaven and earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nYet the Dao, though nameless, is the world’s mother—\nWhy?\nBecause the Named is merely the mother of all things,\nBut not the mother of the world.\nThe Nameless is the origin of heaven and earth,\nAnd all beneath heaven spring from it—\nThus it is said:\n*The world has its origin, which becomes the world’s mother.*\n\nTo hear the Dao is easy;\nTo obtain the Dao is difficult.\nTo obtain the Dao is easy;\nTo guard the Dao is difficult.\n\nNow that I have obtained its mother\nAnd aligned it with my heart—\nNot merely heard—\nI know all things beneath heaven are my own emergence.\nKnowing all things beneath heaven are my own emergence,\nAnd yet I guard it without loss—\nWho beneath heaven could harm what emerges from itself?\nThis is how one serves the body without peril.\n\nClose the senses’ openings,\nShut the gates—\nAnd one’s life is never weary—\nThis is guarding its mother.\nWhen the heart stirs within and I indulge it—\nThis is called *having openings.*\nWith openings, the heart departs and engages things;\nI close the openings and do not pass through—\nNot passing through, the heart does not depart.\nWhen things draw me outward and I receive them—\nThis is called *having gates.*\nWith gates, things enter and disturb the heart;\nI shut the gates and do not receive—\nNot receiving, things do not enter.\nWithin, nothing departs;\nWithout, nothing enters—\nThough myriad transformations teem before me,\nEach returns to its root, unknown—\nWhat weariness is there?\n\nThe ancients could abandon the heart and employ the form—\nThrough this Dao.\n\nIf one opens the openings and does not close them,\nPursues affairs and does not cease—\nThen the heart becomes a mere lodging for things,\nWith nowhere to guard itself—\nWhat reliance could prevent ruin?\nThis is why one’s life is never saved.\n\nOnly those who guard its mother\nPerceive the heart’s stirrings in their subtlest motion\nAnd remain still, unmoved.\nStill and unmoved, yet responsive—\nThus the world’s patterns flow through them—\nHence it is said:\n*To see what is small is called clarity.*\nTo hold fast to the formless ultimate softness—\nNo thing can overcome it—\nHence it is said:\n*To hold fast to softness is called strength.*\nHaving used its radiance to illuminate its stirrings,\nThen returning to its clarity to revert to stillness—\nNever opening the openings, never pursuing affairs—\nHow could calamity befall?\nThus one clings to the harmony of knowing,\nDeep yet unseen—\nHence it is said:\n*Using its radiance, returning to its clarity—\nNo calamity befalls the body—\nThis is called Clinging to the Constant.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: \"If I Were to Be Rigid\"**\n\nIf I were rigidly knowing,\nWalking the Great Dao,\nI would fear only *action.*\n\nThe Great Dao is most level,\nYet people love shortcuts.\nMorning halls are swept clean,\nFields grow overgrown,\nGranaries lie empty—\nFine silks adorn the body,\nSharp swords gird the waist,\nFeasts glut the palate,\nWealth overflows—\nThis is called *robber’s splendor,*\nNot the Dao.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe gentleman’s approach to the Dao\nCannot be without earnestness.\nThe heart, restrained with no excess,\nThough myriad changes array themselves—\nThey cannot disturb my stillness—\nWhat is there to fear in action?\n\nIf I cannot restrain my heart,\nYet rigidly knowing walk the Great Dao,\nI would fear only *action,*\nSeeking to traverse it safely—\nThis is impossible,\nMuch less for those who open the openings\nAnd pursue affairs.\n\nThe essence of the Great Dao lies in its nature—\nto know without knowing,\nand thus attain the utmost levelness.\nYet people seek it with deliberate knowledge,\nloving shortcuts while unaware of the path.\n\nLife’s foundation is food,\nand food must come from the fields.\nWhen fields are tended, granaries are full;\nwhen granaries are full, food suffices;\nwhen food suffices, wealth abounds;\nwhen wealth abounds, the court is orderly—\nfor this is how one knows the source of all things.\n\nBut if one pursues the Great Dao with rigid, deliberate knowing,\nthey lose its origin,\nand without the origin, its manifestations are not their own.\nTo take what is not theirs—\nit is like sweeping one’s courtyard clean,\nneglecting the fields,\nemptying the granaries,\nyet adorning oneself in fine silks,\ngirding sharp swords,\nindulging in feasts,\nand hoarding wealth—\nthis is not their own, yet they take it.\nWithout robbery and ostentation, how could it be?\nHow could this be the Dao?\n\n**Chapter 54: The Unshaken Foundation**\nThose who build well do not uproot;\nthose who embrace well do not slip.\nTheir descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.\n\nCultivate within oneself, and virtue becomes true;\ncultivate within the family, and virtue overflows;\ncultivate within the village, and virtue endures;\ncultivate within the state, and virtue flourishes;\ncultivate within the world, and virtue is universal.\nThus, observe the self to understand the self,\nobserve the family to understand the family,\nobserve the village to understand the village,\nobserve the state to understand the state,\nobserve the world to understand the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe Classic says:\nAll things that are built to stand\nwill inevitably be uprooted.\nOnly those who follow the Dao,\nbuilding with the constant and formless,\nbuild well without contrivance.\n\nAll things that are grasped to hold fast\nwill inevitably slip away.\nOnly those who follow the Dao,\nembracing *qi* with stillness,\ngrasp well without losing hold.\n\nIf what is built and embraced is thus,\nthen its transmission knows no end—\nthis is why descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.\n\nWhat the world calls \"cultivating virtue\"\nsometimes cultivates it in states and nations\nwithout knowing its true origin lies within oneself—\nthus it is said: *Cultivate within the self, and virtue becomes true.*\nOr it is cultivated in the self\nbut cannot extend to states and nations—\nthus it is said: *Cultivate within the family, and virtue overflows,*\n*Cultivate within the village, and virtue endures,*\n*Cultivate within the state, and virtue flourishes,*\n*Cultivate within the world, and virtue is universal.*\n\nZhuangzi held that the true Dao governs the self,\nits remnants benefit the state,\nits remnants’ remnants govern the world—\nhis teaching stems from this.\n\nThen how does one observe and cultivate the self?\nBy observing the self with the self alone.\n\nWhat does it mean to observe the self with the self?\nNow, when I observe what my self possesses—\nI know the source from which my self has come.\nAgain, when I observe what allows me to observe—\nI know the source from which my observing arises.\nHaving known the source of my self’s possession,\nand the source of my observing,\nthen what is needed to cultivate the self is complete,\nrequiring no external aid.\n\nTo observe the family with the family,\nthe state with the state,\nthe world with the world—\nit is the same in principle.\n\nThe ancients hid the world within the world\nby this very Dao.\n\n**Chapter 55: The Depth of Contained Virtue**\nThe depth of contained virtue\nis like that of an infant.\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nferocious beasts do not attack,\ngrasping crows do not peck.\nBones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm;\nthey do not know the union of male and female yet rise erect—\nthis is the peak of *qi*.\nThey wail all day yet their throat does not grow hoarse—\nthis is the peak of harmony.\n\nTo know harmony is to know constancy;\nto know constancy is to know clarity;\nto increase life is to bring auspiciousness;\nto let the heart direct *qi* is to strengthen.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they decline—\nthis is called *not the Dao*.\nNot the Dao brings early decay.\n\nThe Classic says:\nWhen humans are first born,\ntheir innate virtue is most profound.\nAs they grow, their ears and eyes turn outward,\ntheir mind and perception turn inward,\nand with each passing day, their excesses multiply—\nthus their depth diminishes.\n\nThose who follow the Dao reduce what brings excess,\nrefining nature to restore virtue,\nuntil virtue returns to its original state—\nhence it is said: *The depth of contained virtue is like that of an infant.*\n\nFor the infant as a being,\nit is merely that it receives the pure *qi* of the cosmos,\nundispersed, yet poisonous insects do not sting,\nferocious beasts do not attack,\ngrasping crows do not peck.\nHow much more so for one who is fully pure and unguarded,\nharmonized with all things in their creation,\nwhose harmony is vast and universal—\nwho could harm them?\n\nThis is what Wei Wenhou asked of Bo Shuang.\n\nIt is only the pure that can achieve harmony—\nhow do I know this?\nNow, the infant grasps firmly without knowing what it grasps,\nrises erect without knowing what it embraces—\nthis is purity.\nIf the infant had deliberate knowledge of grasping and embracing,\nit would be coarse and inconsistent—\nhow could it remain thus?\nThus it is said: *Bones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm;\nthey do not know the union of male and female yet rise erect—\nthis is the peak of qi.*\n\nWithout worry or anger,\neven if they wail all day, their voice does not grow hoarse—\nthis is harmony.\nIf the infant had worries or anger,\ntheir *qi* would become disordered and unharmonized—\nhow could they remain thus?\nThus it is said: *They wail all day yet their throat does not grow hoarse—\nthis is the peak of harmony.*\n\nWhen form is complete and *qi* is restored,\none aligns with the cosmos.\nRefining and refining again,\nreturning to align with Heaven.\n\nWhen refinement reaches aligning with Heaven,\nthe pure *qi* of the cosmos becomes vast and universal—\nhow could it differ from all things?\n\nThus, the ultimate of governance\nreturns to restoring one’s original nature—\nrestoring one’s original nature is called constancy.\nThe depth of contained virtue\nreaches knowing harmony—\nknowing harmony is also called constancy.\n\nThough virtue and the Dao may differ,\nwhen they converge in constancy,\nthey are one.\n\nTo know constancy,\none follows it naturally without excess,\nacting without knowing what to do,\nmoving without knowing where to go—\nthe body like a withered tree’s branch,\nthe heart like dead ashes—\nhow could the heart direct *qi* then?\n\nThus, excess leads to what is called *auspiciousness*.\nMisfortune and fortune have no fixed form—\nthen there are no human calamities or *auspiciousness*.\nMisfortune and fortune manifest here,\nand human disasters follow in their wake.\n\nWhen the heart directs *qi*, it is called *strength*.\nThose who *strengthen* the *yang* are doomed.\n\nTo attain emptiness and uphold softness—\nthis is the Dao.\nThe Dao endures, lasting long,\nand one’s life remains unperilled.\n\nTo attain fullness and *strength*—\nthen one is but an object among things.\nWhen things flourish, they grow old—\nthis is their Dao.\nThus it is said:\n*\"When things flourish, they grow old—*\nthis is called *not-Dao*,\nand *not-Dao* perishes early.\"\n\n**Chapter 56: The Wise Do Not Speak**\nThe wise do not *nurture* (the artificial),\nthose who speak do not know (the true).\nStop its *joyousness*,\nclose its gates,\ndull its sharpness,\nuntangle its confusion,\nsoften its brilliance,\nblend with the dust—\nthis is called *mysterious unity*.\n\nIt cannot be approached as near,\nnor rejected as distant;\nit cannot be seized as advantageous,\nnor avoided as harmful;\nit cannot be exalted as noble,\nnor debased as lowly.\nThus it is most noble under Heaven.\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"To know constancy is the utmost of knowing.*\nWhen knowing reaches its utmost,\none acts silently and achieves it,\nand nothing remains ungoverned—\nwhat need is there for the heart to intervene?\n\nIf one cannot refrain from speech,\none cannot refrain from self—\nthough one may know, it is not true knowing.\nThus it is said:\n*The wise do not speak,\nthose who speak do not know.*\n\nStop its *joyousness*,\nclose its gates,\ndull its sharpness,\nuntangle its confusion,\nsoften its brilliance,\nblend with the dust—\nthis is the Dao of silent achievement.\n\nIf such is the case,\nall things become a single repository,\nlife and death share the same form—\nnothing is excessively close,\nnothing is excessively distant.\nThus it cannot be approached as near,\nnor rejected as distant.\n\nIt does not pursue advantage,\nnor shun harm—\nthus it cannot be seized as advantageous,\nnor avoided as harmful.\n\nIt neither boasts of prominence,\nnor wallows in obscurity—\nthus it cannot be exalted as noble,\nnor debased as lowly.\n\nIf one can be approached as near or distant,\nadvantaged or harmful,\nnoble or lowly—\nthen nobility lies in things,\nand things can debase it.\n\nIf one cannot be approached as near or distant,\nadvantaged or harmful,\nnoble or lowly—\nthen nobility lies within oneself,\nand things cannot debase it.\n\nThus its nobility under Heaven is most fitting.\n\nYet if one speaks of the Dao with speech,\nthen speech is not the Dao,\nand those who know use speech as knowing—\nthis is knowing *knowing*.\nThus speech must emerge,\nfor though it emerges from non-speech,\neven in speech, it remains unsaid.\nHow could the Dao be merely silent?\n\n**Chapter 57: Governing with Rectitude**\nGovern with rectitude,\nemploy the *unconventional* in warfare,\nand take the world with non-action.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBecause of this.\n\n**Chapter 58: The Politics of Obscurity**\n\nWhen the world abounds in taboos,\nthe people grow ever poorer.\nWhen men multiply clever devices,\nthe state grows ever more confused.\nWhen men multiply arts and cunning,\nstrange things proliferate.\nWhen laws and decrees proliferate,\nthieves and robbers abound.\n\nThus the Sage says:\n*\"I act without action, and the people transform themselves.\nI take no action, and the people grow rich.\nI love stillness, and the people align themselves.\nI desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The military does not enter the state,\nthe state does not enter the military—\nthis distinction has endured long,\nand thus the methods of governing and waging war differ fundamentally.\"*\n\nTo govern a state,\none must not rely on fleeting or transient measures—\nthus, one governs with rectitude, not with the unconventional.\nRectitude is what endures and persists.\nWarfare is an inauspicious instrument,\nnot the tool of the virtuous—\nthus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it.\nIf warfare persists and endures,\nthen one has indeed dwelled upon it—\nthus, one employs the unconventional, not rectitude.\nThe unconventional is what responds to the exigencies of the moment.\n\nBecause of this, one cannot avoid using rectitude in governance,\nand thus it is said:\n*\"Do not govern with cleverness—\nthis is the blessing of the state.*\nTo govern without relying on cleverness,\nit is clear that one cannot take the world with action.\nThus it is said:\n*'Govern with rectitude,\nemploy the unconventional in warfare,\nand take the world with non-action.'*\n\nHow do I know that non-action suffices to take the world?\nBecause action does not suffice to take the world,\nand thus I know it.\n\nOnly when one departs from non-action\nand arrives at action,\ndoes the world abound in taboos—\nmen avoid what they fear,\nand thus the unemployed multiply while the people grow ever poorer.\nMen multiply clever devices to pursue their desires,\nand thus the lower orders become difficult to govern,\nwhile the state grows ever more confused.\nThe people grow ever poorer and more cunning,\nthe state grows ever more confused and strange things proliferate—\nthis is why laws and decrees proliferate,\nand thieves and robbers abound.\n\nLaws are enforced where they are applied,\nbut cannot be enforced where they are not.\nDecrees are obeyed where they are heard,\nbut cannot be obeyed where they are not.\nWhen the people are poor and cunning,\nthere will be places where decrees are not obeyed.\nWhen the state is confused and strange things proliferate,\nthere will be places where laws are not applied—\nthis is why they proliferate and thieves and robbers abound.\n\nIf this is so,\nthen all the faults of taking the world with action are evident.\nThus the Sage says:\n*\"I act without action, and the people transform themselves.\nI love stillness, and the people align themselves.\nI take no action, and the people grow rich.\nI desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\nThis is the constant proof that the world is taken with non-action.\n\nFor if one acts without action,\nthe people transform themselves,\nand if one loves stillness,\nthe people align themselves—\nthen the people will not multiply cunning,\nstrange things will not proliferate,\nlaws and decrees will not proliferate,\nand thieves and robbers will not abound.\nIf one takes no action,\nthe people grow rich,\nand if one desires nothing,\nthe people return to simplicity—\nthen the world will not abound in taboos,\nand the people will not grow poorer,\nnor will men multiply clever devices\nand the state grow confused.\n\nThis is why,\nwhen one departs from non-action,\nthe world abounds in taboos and the people grow poorer,\nmen multiply clever devices and the state grows confused.\nOnly thus do the people multiply cunning,\nstrange things proliferate,\nlaws and decrees proliferate,\nand thieves and robbers abound.\n\nTo reverse this,\none must return to non-action and love stillness—\nthrough non-action, the people transform themselves,\nand abandon cunning, discard profit,\nso that strange things do not arise.\nThrough loving stillness, the people align themselves,\nand thieves and robbers disappear.\nFrom non-action and loving stillness,\none arrives at non-action and no desire.\nThrough non-action, the people grow rich\nand are free from the poverty of taboos.\nThrough no desire, the people return to simplicity\nand are free from the confusion of clever devices.\n\nSuch is the order of things.\n\n**Chapter 58: The Politics of Obscurity**\nWhen governance is obscure,\nthe people are pure.\nWhen governance is scrutinizing,\nthe people are artful.\n\nCalamity, oh calamity—\nit leans upon fortune.\nFortune, oh fortune—\nit harbors calamity within.\nWho knows their ultimate end?\nIs there no rectitude at all?\nRectitude becomes the unconventional,\nthe good becomes the ominous.\nThe people’s confusion has endured long.\n\nThus the Sage is square without sharp edges,\nsharp without severity,\nstraight without arrogance,\nbright without dazzling.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Govern with rectitude,\ntake the world with non-action—\nthen governance is obscure.\nObscure governance means one does not take scrutiny as pleasure,\nand thus the people are pure.\nPure means they are not corrupted by superficiality.\nTo govern with cleverness,\nto take the world with action—\nthen governance is scrutinizing.\nScrutinizing is the opposite of obscure,\nand thus the people are artful.\nArtful means they are not complete in simplicity.\n\nPure, they rest in virtue and nature,\nand are not swayed by calamity, fortune, the unconventional, the good, or the ominous—\nthis is not being corrupted by superficiality.\nArtful, they avoid calamity but are not necessarily free from it,\nseek fortune but are not necessarily rewarded—\nwhat they take as rectitude may sometimes be the unconventional,\nwhat they take as good may sometimes be the ominous.\nCalamity, fortune, the unconventional, the good, the ominous—\ntheir ultimate end is unknown,\nand cleverness only multiplies difficulties in governance—\nthis is not being complete in simplicity.\n\nWhy is this?\nTime has beginnings and ends,\nthe world undergoes change—\ncalamity and fortune, obscure and pure,\nsometimes clash, sometimes align.\nWhat clashes is what the world calls calamity,\nbut what aligns is what fortune leans upon.\nWhat aligns is what the world calls fortune,\nbut what clashes is what calamity harbors within.\nThen who knows their ultimate end\nand how to avoid or embrace them?\nMen have followed their own faces,\nsome things are correct, some are erroneous—\nthus what is called rectitude may not truly be known.\n\nNow, what is taken as rectitude\nmay later become the unconventional,\nand what is taken as the unconventional\nmay later become rectitude—\nthe good and the ominous are the same.\nThus the calamity, fortune, rectitude, unconventional, good, and ominous of the world\nare ultimately indeterminable.\n\nSince men first knew,\nthey have been confused and clung to these distinctions—\ntheir error has endured long.\nHow can one add to it with scrutinizing governance\nand prevent them from returning to simplicity and wholeness?\"\n\nThus the Sage is square yet does not cut,\nand so does not use one man’s measure to govern all under Heaven.\nHe is tranquil yet does not harm,\nand so overcomes all things without injury.\nHe is upright yet not rigid,\nand so can preserve the crooked and straighten the bent.\nHe is luminous yet not dazzling,\nand so employs his light while returning to his clarity.\n\nThis is no other thing—\nit is to take this *mèn-mèn* and discard that *cháchá*,\nto abandon scrutiny and return to simplicity.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing Men and Serving Heaven**\n\nTo govern men and serve Heaven,\nnothing surpasses *jǐn* (frugality).\nFor only *jǐn* is called *zǎo fù* (early restoration).\n*Early restoration* is called *chóng jī dé* (profoundly accumulating virtue),\nand profoundly accumulating virtue conquers all.\nWhen all is conquered, none can fathom its limit—\nwhen none can fathom its limit,\nthen one may possess a realm.\nThe mother of possessing a realm,\nthis is the Dao of deep roots, firm foundations,\nand enduring life with lasting vision.\n\nThe Classic says:\nTo govern men without using what makes them *men* to govern them,\nthen men cannot truly be governed.\nTo serve Heaven without using what makes it *Heaven* to serve it,\nthen Heaven cannot truly be served.\nWhen spirit pervades and flows in all directions without limit,\nnurturing all things,\nits name is *tóngdì* (the Sovereign of All),\nfor this is what makes men *men* and Heaven *Heaven*.\nThe pure, unadorned Dao—\nonly the divine preserves it.\nPreserve it without loss,\nand unite with the divine—\nthen how could men not be governed,\nhow could Heaven not be served?\n\nThus it is said:\nTo govern men and serve Heaven,\nnothing surpasses *yīn* (music/sound).\nFor only *jǐn* preserves the spirit without exertion—\nthis is *early restoration*.\nIf one is not *jǐn* but dissipates it,\nuntil spirit is exhausted and essence worn,\neven if one wished to restore the spirit,\nthere would be no way to enter—\nhow could this not be late?\nThus it is said:\nOnly *yīn* is called *early restoration*.\n\nMan’s life is inherently sufficient in virtue.\nIf truly able to practice *jǐn* and restore early,\nthen virtue grows daily—\nthus it is called *early restoration* as *profoundly accumulating virtue*.\nProfoundly accumulating virtue—\nthis is the utmost of virtue.\nThe utmost virtue:\nfire cannot burn it,\nwater cannot drown it,\ncold and heat cannot harm it,\nand beasts cannot assail it—\nthen where could it not conquer?\nThus it is said:\nProfoundly accumulating virtue conquers all.\nIf there is what it cannot conquer,\nthen its Dao has a limit.\nIf all is conquered,\nwho can know its limit?\nThus it is said:\nWhen all is conquered, none can fathom its limit.\n\nHe who holds the land holds great things.\nHe who holds great things\ndoes not use things to govern things,\nand because he does not govern things,\nhe can govern all things.\nNone can fathom its limit—\nthis is to not govern yet govern all things.\nThough he holds the land, he bears no burden—\nthus it is said:\nWhen none can fathom its limit,\none may possess a realm.\nHaving obtained its mother,\none knows its child.\nHaving known its child,\none returns to guard its mother.\nThus the body is unharmed—\nhence it is said:\nThe mother of possessing a realm\ncan endure forever.\n\nThus the Dao of *yīn*\nis called the Dao of deep roots, firm foundations,\nand enduring life with lasting vision.\nSpirit is the root of life—\npreserve and store it,\nand the root deepens while life grows.\nEnduring life is the foundation of vision—\nguard and protect it,\nand the foundation is firm while vision endures.\n\n*End of Volume Three of the Transmission of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic*\n*Volume Four of the Transmission of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic*\n\n**Volume Four of the Transmission of the Dao/Way and Virtue Classic**\n\n**Chapter Sixty: Governing a Great Realm**\n\nTo govern a great realm is like poaching a small fish.\nTo rule the world with the Dao,\nits spirits are not numinous.\nNot that its spirits are not numinous—\nbut because they are not numinous, they do not harm the people.\nAnd because they do not harm the people,\nthe Sage does not harm the people.\nThus, when neither harms the other,\nvirtue and power return to each other.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Having obtained the mother of possessing a realm to govern the realm,\neven the greatest task is without difficulty.\"*\n\nOne does not overcook a fish when poaching,\nand when poaching a small fish,\none must preserve it whole, not cutting it.\nSo too with governing a great realm—\nif one cooks and cuts it, harm will come.\nTo rule the world with the Dao is called the Great Measure—\nit is simply to refrain from cutting and harming.\n\nWhen it reaches its utmost,\nits spirits are not numinous—\nthis is simply the result of not harming.\nHow so?\nThe spirits, by the Dao,\nare not without numinosity—\nwhen they mingle and contend with humanity,\ntheir numinosity appears,\nand they cannot but harm people.\nYet why are they not numinous?\nBecause the Sage can rule the world with the Dao,\npreventing people from indulging their nature,\nfrom straying in their virtue,\nfrom extreme joy or anger that disrupts the harmony of yin and yang—\nthose who dwell in the undifferentiated void,\nin harmony with the age, attaining tranquility—\nthus, the Sage does not harm people.\nOnly the Sage can refrain from harming people,\nso yin and yang remain harmonious and still,\nspirits and gods do not disturb,\nall things are unharmed,\nand life does not perish early—\nthus, their numinosity does not harm people.\nWhen their numinosity does not harm people,\nthere is no need for their manifestations to appear as numinous.\nFrom this, it is seen:\nTheir spirits are not numinous,\nnot because their spirits are not numinous—\nbut because their numinosity does not harm people,\nthey are not numinous.\nNot because their numinosity does not harm people—\nbut because the Sage does not harm people,\ntheir numinosity does not harm people.\nIf the Sage, in relation to the people,\ncannot preserve their primal purity and harms them,\nand people lose their nature,\nso that the seasons do not arrive,\nthe balance of cold and heat is not achieved,\nand the ways in which people harm spirits multiply—\nthen how could the spirits not harm people?\nOnly when spirits do not harm people\ndo they return virtue to humanity,\nand when spirits do not harm people,\npeople in turn return virtue to the spirits—\nthus it is said:\n*\"When neither harms the other,\nvirtue and power return to each other.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One: The Great Realm as the Lowly Stream**\n\nThe great realm is the lowly stream of the world,\nthe world’s exchange, the world’s exchange as the receptive.\nThe receptive always overcomes the active through stillness,\nand stillness is the lowly.\nThus, when the great realm yields to the small realm,\nit takes the small realm;\nwhen the small realm yields to the great realm,\nit takes the great realm.\nThus, sometimes yielding to take,\nsometimes yielding and taking.\nThe great realm seeks only to nurture people,\nthe small realm seeks only to serve the great.\nBoth obtain what they desire,\nso the greater should yield.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Knowing how to govern one’s realm with the Dao,\none certainly does not harm its people—\nyet if one does not know how to exchange with the world,\nthen even if one does not harm people,\nthere will still be those who harm them.\"*\n\nThe great realm as the lowly stream,\nthe world’s exchange, the world’s exchange as the receptive—\nthe receptive always overcomes the active through stillness,\nand stillness is the lowly.\nThis is the way to exchange with the world\nand preserve its people.\nIndeed, the world’s exchange is the receptive,\nand the receptive always overcomes the active through stillness—\nand the reason it overcomes is because it yields through stillness.\n\nIf the great realm truly dwells in the lowly stream\nto achieve the world’s exchange,\nthen the receptive’s stillness as the lowly\nis the way to overcome the active—\nthus, when the great yields to the small,\nit takes the small—\nthis is what is meant by *\"yielding to take.\"*\nYielding to take means:\nThough the great, in relation to the small,\nseems as if it could avoid yielding,\nit yields to take in winter.\nWhen the small yields to the great,\nit takes the great—\nthis is what is meant by *\"yielding and taking.\"*\nYielding and taking means:\nThough the small, in relation to the great,\ncannot but yield to take.\nIndeed, the great seeks only to nurture people,\nwhile the small seeks only to serve the great.\nNow, the great yields to the small,\nand the small yields to the great—\nboth obtain what they desire,\nso who would not take?\nTaking means:\nTo win their hearts and not lose them.\n\nThen why does it say only the great should yield?\nBecause if the small cannot yield to the great,\nit not only fails to take the great realm\nbut also invites calamity upon itself—\nthus, it is not merely inappropriate,\nhence it is said: *\"The great should yield.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Innermost Essence of All Things**\n\nThe Dao is the innermost essence of all things,\nthe treasure of the virtuous,\nthe refuge of the unvirtuous.\nBeautiful words can be sold,\nnoble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\nWhat is there to abandon in humanity’s unvirtue?\nThus, when establishing the Son of Heaven\nand appointing the Three Ministers,\neven if one offers a jade tablet before four horses,\nit is not as good as presenting this Dao.\n\nThe ancients valued this Dao so highly—\nwhy not seek it daily to obtain it,\nand use it to avert guilt?\nThus, it is the most precious for the world.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"All things bear yin within and embrace yang without,\nand through the interplay of the void and qi achieve harmony—\nthus, there is not a single thing that is not complete within the Dao.\"*\n\nA house has its innermost chamber,\ndeep and secluded, where the honored dwell.\nAll things have their deep, secluded, and honored places—\nthis is the Dao.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The Dao is the innermost essence of all things.\"*\nBecause of this,\nit is the treasure of the virtuous\nand the refuge of the unvirtuous.\nHow so?\nThe virtuous know where their virtue originates,\nand thus, obtaining it, they possess boundless, inexhaustible wealth—\nis this not their treasure?\nThe unvirtuous, knowing their unvirtue,\nwhen they reach this point of profound unity,\neven with ten thousand evils,\nthey dissolve and release—\nis this not their refuge?\n\nThe beauty of speech can be traded,\nthe nobility of action can be bestowed upon others—\nyet all people, whether good or evil,\nknow what is truly beautiful and what is truly noble.\n\nThose who embody the Dao toward others,\nare like Heaven and Earth:\nHeaven covers all without exception,\nEarth bears all without exception—\nfar surpassing the comparison of beautiful speech and noble actions.\nThus, how could there be any evil in people that should be discarded?\n\nTherefore, when establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers,\neven if one offers a jade tablet before swift horses\nto honor the sovereign,\nit is only the reverence of ritual and the weight of the gift.\nYet this cannot compare to sitting and presenting this Dao—\nfor the Dao is the most precious treasure for all under Heaven.\nEven if presented while seated,\nit surpasses the reverence of ritual and the weight of gifts.\n\nThe Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers\ngather to discuss nothing but this.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao in such high regard?\nWas it merely to seek and obtain,\nor to have crimes pardoned?\n\nTo hold it as the most precious for all under Heaven,\nto seek and obtain it—\nthis is the treasure of the virtuous.\nTo have crimes pardoned through it—\nthis is the refuge of the unvirtuous.\nBecause of this,\nit is the most precious for all under Heaven,\nand thus the ancients could not help but honor it.\n\n**Chapter 63: On Non-Action**\nTo act without acting,\nto manage without managing,\nto savor without savoring—\ngreat or small, much or little,\nto repay resentment with virtue.\n\nTo plan for difficulty in its ease,\nto achieve greatness in its triviality.\nThe most difficult tasks under Heaven\nmust begin with what is easy;\nthe greatest undertakings under Heaven\nmust begin with what is small.\nThus, the Sage never strives for greatness,\nand so achieves true greatness.\n\nLight promises bring few fulfillments,\nmany trivialities bring many difficulties.\nTherefore, the Sage anticipates difficulty,\nand so never faces it.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThose who embody the Dao\nact by doing nothing,\nand so practice non-action.\nTo act without acting,\nto manage without managing,\nto savor without savoring—\nhow so?\nWhen we are in the midst of doing,\nwe seek the doer and find none—\nthis is to act by doing nothing.\nIf there is action, there is managing;\nto act without acting means managing without managing.\nNot only is there no managing,\nbut even savoring it yields no taste.\nTo savor is to repeatedly examine and ponder it.\nThe Dao, as a thing,\ncannot be seen when looked at,\ncannot be heard when listened to,\ncannot be grasped when seized—\neven when repeatedly examined and pondered,\nit returns to nothingness.\nBecause of this,\nit can be great, can be small,\ncan be much, can be little.\nMuch and little depend on oneself,\nand those called \"resentful\" have no fixed hearts—\nthus, even the unvirtuous I treat with virtue,\nand virtue repays virtue.\nThe untrustworthy I treat with trust,\nand trust repays trust,\nand all are repaid with virtue.\n\nWhat people find hardest to forget is resentment,\nyet to repay it with virtue,\nnothing burdens the heart.\nThis is not mere talk—\nto plan for difficulty in its ease,\nto achieve greatness in its triviality,\nto ensure that all difficult tasks under Heaven\nbegin with what is easy,\nand all great undertakings under Heaven\nbegin with what is small—\nwhile I myself remain ever non-acting.\nIf there is any action,\nit must be seen in what is easy and small,\nand this is what is meant by \"knowing the subtle omens.\"\nIf one attains this in the heart,\nthen extending it to all under Heaven and the state\nis without difficulty.\n\nThus, the Sage never strives for greatness,\nand so achieves true greatness—\nfor greatness lies in what is small,\nnot in what is already great.\n\nA promise is easy to make,\nbut difficult to fulfill.\nIf one is not cautious at the moment of promising,\nfulfillment becomes difficult.\nWhat is easy to plan when easy becomes difficult when difficult—\nif one does not plan at the beginning when it is easy,\nbut waits until it is difficult,\nthen it becomes difficult—\nthis is why common people are few in trust and often face difficulties.\n\nTherefore, the Sage anticipates difficulty,\nand so never faces it—\nby anticipating difficulty when it is easy,\nand not waiting until it is difficult.\n\n**Chapter 64: On Ease and Simplicity**\nWhat is stable is easy to hold,\nwhat is not yet manifest is easy to plan,\nwhat is fragile is easy to break,\nwhat is subtle is easy to disperse.\nAct before it exists,\ngovern before it is disordered.\n\nA tree thick enough to embrace\ngrows from a sprout;\na nine-tiered tower\nbegins with a clod of earth;\na thousand-li journey\nstarts beneath one’s feet.\n\nTo act when it already exists\nleads to ruin;\nto grasp when it is already formed\nleads to loss.\nThus, the Sage acts without acting and so knows no ruin,\nholds without grasping and so knows no loss.\n\nThe people’s undertakings\noften fail when nearly complete.\nTo be as careful at the end as at the beginning,\nthere will be no failed endeavors.\n\nThus, the Sage desires what others do not desire,\ndoes not prize what is difficult to obtain;\nlearns what others have not learned,\ncorrects what others have erred in,\nand aids the natural unfolding of all things\nwithout daring to act.\n\nThe Classic says:\nWhat is stable is easy to hold—\nif it is already precarious and then held,\nit becomes difficult.\nWhat is not yet manifest is easy to plan—\nif it is already in motion and then planned,\nit becomes difficult.\nWhat is fragile is easy to break—\ndo not let it reach solidity.\nWhat is subtle is easy to disperse—\ndo not let it take form.\nAll things are thus,\nbut the heart is the most so.\nExtending this to the heart,\nthere is no difficulty in all under Heaven and the state.\n\nStability, not yet manifest—\nthis is to act before it exists.\nFragility, subtlety—\nthis is to govern before it is disordered.\nA tree thick enough to embrace grows from a sprout—\nit grows from small beginnings.\nA nine-tiered tower begins with a clod of earth—\nheight arises from the low.\nA thousand-li journey starts beneath one’s feet—\ndistance begins with nearness.\nThus, to act before it exists,\nto govern before it is disordered—\nthe beginning and end are always thus.\n\nTo act before it exists\nis to achieve by doing nothing.\nTo govern before it is disordered\nis to order by not ordering.\nIf it already exists and then acted upon,\naction seeks completion but instead brings ruin.\nIf it is already disordered and then governed,\ngrasping seeks stability but instead brings loss.\n\nThus, the Sage acts before it exists,\nyet remains in non-action—\nso there is no ruin.\nHe governs before it is disordered,\nyet holds no grasp—\nso there is no loss.\n\nThe people act only after things already exist,\nso they reach near-completion only to fail—\nfor they do not know its origin.\n\nIf they knew that greatness arises from smallness,\nheight from lowliness,\ndistance from nearness,\nand treated the end with the care of the beginning,\nthen there would be no failed undertakings.\n\nTherefore, the Sage desires without desiring,\nvalues not the hard-to-obtain treasures,\nso that his desires may glide beyond the common,\nand his thoughts may seek to attain clarity—\nyet this is not what is truly known.\n\nHe learns without learning,\ncorrecting the errors of the multitude,\nassisting the natural unfolding of all things,\nyet daring not to act—\nthus refining his nature amidst the common,\nwhile the common learn to return to their origins—\nyet this too is not what is truly known.\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Ancient Masters of the Dao**\n\nThe ancient masters of the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people,\nbut rather to make them simple.\nFor the people are difficult to govern because they are too clever.\n\nThus, to govern a state with cleverness is to ruin it;\nto govern without cleverness is to bless it.\nTo know these two principles is to grasp the standard.\n\nTo always know the standard is called *Xuan Virtue*.\n*Xuan Virtue* is profound and distant,\ncontrary to things—\nand only then does it reach the greatest harmony.\n\nThe saying goes:\n*\"While others are bright and clear,\nI alone seem dim;\nWhile others are sharp and discerning,\nI alone am muddled—\nthis is the heart of the simple.\"*\n\nThe ancient masters of the Dao,\nif such was their nature within themselves,\nthen when applied to the people,\nwas not to enlighten them,\nbut to make them simple.\n\nBright and clear—this is called enlightenment.\nDim and muddled—this is called simplicity.\n\nThe people lose their nature,\ndwelling in ornament while abandoning substance,\nso their cleverness multiplies and they become hard to govern.\n\nIf one truly wishes to govern them,\nthen remove their cleverness and their artifices,\nand steady them with the nameless simplicity—\nthen they will transform of their own accord.\nBut if one governs them with cleverness,\nit is only to further confuse them.\n\nIf one does not recognize, does not know,\nand follows the natural patterns,\nthen to harm those patterns is to be a thief.\nTo govern a state with cleverness\nis to harm its natural patterns—\nthus it is said: *\"To govern a state with cleverness is to ruin it.\"*\n\nTo govern a state without cleverness\nis to have no obtrusive knowledge,\nits way is smooth and unforced,\nand there is no blessing of life—\nyet it has the mother of the state,\nwhich can endure forever.\nThus, to govern a state without cleverness is to bless it.\n\nTo know these two principles\nis not only the standard for governing a state,\nbut also for oneself—\nnever straying from it.\n\nIf one knows the child but guards the mother,\nthen the body remains unharmed—\nthis is to govern without cleverness, and it brings blessing.\n\nIf one opens the *Jue* (receptivity) and aids its affairs,\nyet the end is never reached—\nthis is to govern with cleverness, and it brings ruin.\n\nThus, whether to govern with or without cleverness—\nis this not also my standard?\n\nIf one truly knows the standard and does not stray from virtue,\nthen it may be called *Xuan*.\nWhen virtue reaches *Xuan*,\nit is deep and unfathomable,\ndistant and immeasurable—\nobserved through emotion, it cannot be grasped by the heart,\nyet when it arrives,\nit returns to the root of things,\nand nothing opposes it.\nThus it is said:\n*\"To always know the standard is to possess Xuan Virtue.\"*\n\n*Xuan Virtue* is profound and distant,\ncontrary to things—\nand only then does it reach the greatest harmony.\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-Six: The River and Sea as King of the Valleys**\n\nThe river and sea become king of the valleys\nbecause they excel in yielding.\nThus, the Sage who wishes to be above others\nspeaks in a way that is below them;\nwho wishes to lead others\nplaces himself behind them.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven: The Way of Non-Contention**\n\nThus, though one is placed above others, they are not resented;\nthough one is placed before others, they are not harmed.\nTherefore, the world willingly promotes them without exhaustion.\nBecause they do not contend, none under heaven can contend with them.\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"The river and sea become king of the valleys because they excel in yielding—\nthus, he who can be king over the world also excels in yielding.\nTherefore, *Xuan Virtue* is the Way by which one yields to those below.\"*\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"If one dwells below through this Way,\nthen it is the Way of the *Xuan Sage* and the *Unadorned King*—\nand when Shun was below, he said, 'My *Xuan Virtue* ascends in renown.'\nThus, *Xuan Virtue* is indeed the Way by which the Sage dwells below.\nTo dwell below through this Way while occupying a position above others—\nthis is how one yields to them.\"*\n\nThe Sage, though ruling the world,\nin terms of his station, certainly desires to be above others—\nyet he calls himself *\"the lonely, the orphaned, the destitute\"* and accepts the filth and misfortune of the state,\nfor he speaks in a way that is below them.\nIn terms of his order, he certainly desires to lead others—\nyet he is pressed before he moves, responds only when moved,\nand acts only when compelled—\nfor he places himself behind them.\n\nIf one speaks in a way that is below others,\nthen though placed above, they do not resent him—\nand if they do not resent him, they will bear him lightly.\nIf one places himself behind others,\nthen though placed before them, they do not harm him—\nand if they do not harm him, they will follow him as beneficial.\n\nNot resented, not harmed—\nthis is why the world willingly promotes him without exhaustion.\nHe who speaks in a way that is below others\nand places himself behind others—\nthis is the one who does not contend.\nWhen the world willingly promotes him without exhaustion,\nnone under heaven can contend with him.\nUnless one embodies *Xuan Virtue*,\nhow could it be so?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Only because he does not contend,\nnone under heaven can contend with him.\"*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The World’s Misunderstanding**\n\nThe world all say my Dao is great, yet it seems unworthy.\nOnly because it is great does it seem unworthy.\nIf it were worthy for long, it would be trifling indeed.\n\nI have three treasures; I hold and preserve them:\nFirst, *compassion*;\nSecond, *frugality*;\nThird, *not daring to act first under heaven.*\n\n*Compassion*, thus one can be courageous;\n*Frugality*, thus one can be expansive;\n*Not daring to act first under heaven*, thus one can become a vessel and leader.\n\nNow, if one abandons *compassion* and courage,\nabandons *frugality* and expansiveness,\nabandons *following* and acts first—\nthen death is deserved.\n\n*Compassion*, in war brings victory;\nin defense, it makes firm.\nHeaven, when it would save, guards with *compassion*.\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"The world sees only my Dao’s greatness\nand says it seems unworthy,\nyet they do not know\nwhy it is great—\nit is because it seems unworthy.\nHow so?\nThe Great Dao is vast and unrestricted,\nleft and right, nowhere it is not present.\nThey see it is nowhere not present,\nyet nothing to compare to—\nthey call it unworthy,\nyet they do not know\nthat because it is nowhere not present,\nit seems unworthy—\nthis is how the Dao’s greatness manifests.\nTruly, all things are not apart from the Dao—\nthen the Dao has nothing outside it.\nIf the Dao has nothing outside it,\nthen there is nothing to which it resembles—\nthis is why it is great.\nIf there were something to which it resembled,\nthen the Dao would have something outside it.\nIf the Dao has something outside it,\nthen the Dao is not everywhere present—\nhow could it still be great?\nThus it is said:\n*The world all say my Dao is great, yet it seems unworthy.\nOnly because it is great does it seem unworthy.\nIf it were worthy for long, it would be trifling indeed.*\n\nTruly, my Dao is so great\nbecause I have no self and do not contend.\nOnly because I have no self and do not contend\ncan I hold what others find difficult to hold.\nI have three treasures; I hold and preserve them:\nFirst, *compassion*;\nSecond, *frugality*;\nThird, *not daring to act first under heaven.*\nThese are all what others find difficult to hold.\nHow so?\nPeople cannot have no self and not contend,\nso though courageous, they cannot be compassionate;\nthough expansive, they cannot be frugal;\nthough they act first, they cannot follow—\nonly by having no self and not contending\ncan one preserve these three treasures and hold them.\n\nUnder heaven, there is a beginning—\ncalled the Mother of the world—\nand I guard it,\nalways broad and accommodating toward things,\nnever diminishing others.\nIs this not *compassion*?\nIn conducting oneself,\nslow and unexhausted,\ntaking *moderation* as principle—\nis this not *frugality*?\nNever acting first, always following others—\nwhile others all take the lead,\none alone takes the rear—\nis this not *not daring to act first under heaven*?\n\n*Compassion* is soft and weak,\nyet it overcomes the strong and rigid—\nthis is courage.\n*Frugality* is not wasteful,\nyet its use is inexhaustible—\nthis is expansiveness.\n*Not daring to act first under heaven* is to be last,\nyet the Sage uses this to become an official and leader—\nall follow me—\nthis is to become a vessel and leader.\n\nNow, if one abandons *compassion* and courage,\nabandons *frugality* and expansiveness,\nabandons *following* and acts first—\nthen they are merely the rigid and strong,\nand death is indeed deserved.\n\nFrom the perspective of affairs,\nmilitary campaigns love to display their might,\nand if their victories are complete and without flaw,\nthen *compassion* seems to have no place.\nYet from the perspective of the root,\nwhat establishes their might is *compassion* alone.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Compassion*, in war brings victory;\nin defense, it makes firm.\"\n\n*Compassion* is the origin of the three treasures—\nfrugality and not daring to act first under heaven.\nIf one abandons *compassion*, death follows;\nif one preserves *compassion*, life follows—\nthus *compassion* is what guards my life.\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"Heaven, when it would save, guards with compassion.\"*\nWhen *compassion* is established, the three treasures arise.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Virtue of the Gentle Scholar**\n\nThe virtuous scholar does not rely on force;\nthe virtuous warrior does not grow angry;\nthe one who best defeats enemies does not contend;\nthe one who best uses people places himself below them.\n\nThis is called the *virtue of non-contention*,\nthis is called the *power of using people*,\nthis is called the *harmony of ancient times with Heaven*.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Doctrine of the Gentle Scholar (Continued)**\n\nThe Classics say: *\"The term 'scholar' (士) refers to one who serves the Dao and takes upon himself the responsibility of guiding others.\"* To serve the Dao is to triumph through non-contention; to guide others is to employ the *power of using people*. If this is so, then what need is there for force? Hence it is said: *\"The virtuous scholar does not rely on force.\"* For a scholar who has no need of force, then the one skilled in battle does not grow angry, the one who best defeats enemies does not contend, and the one who best uses people places himself below them—this is only proper.\n\nWhy is this? Those who embody the Dao do not contend; when they do not contend, none under heaven can contend with them. Thus, the virtuous scholar does not rely on force, the skilled warrior does not grow angry, and the one who best defeats enemies does not contend—this is called the *virtue of non-contention*. Those who embody the Dao can place themselves below others; those who place themselves below others take joy in being used and do not seek self-use. Thus, the one who best uses people places himself below them—this is called the *power of using people*.\n\nIn *virtue*, there is no contention; in *power*, one employs others. Even in the dangers of warfare, I remain without action—how much more so in all else? To act without acting is the *virtue of Heaven*; when one reaches the state of non-action, one aligns with Heaven and cannot be surpassed. Hence it is said: *\"This is called the harmony of ancient times with Heaven.\"*\n\n**Chapter Seventy: The Art of Warfare**\n\nThe art of warfare has this saying: *\"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"* This is called *moving without moving*, *pushing without arms*, *conquering without opposition*, *holding without weapons*. No greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy; to underestimate the enemy risks losing my treasures. Hence, when armies clash, the compassionate shall prevail.\n\nThe Classics say: *\"The Dao’s movement always arises from being pressed yet triumphing through non-contention. When applied to warfare, it should seem as though there is no action.\"* Yet those who wage war say: *\"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"* Thus, even in war, one moves only when pressed, yet triumphs through non-contention—how much more so in all else?\n\nWhy is this? The aggressor is reversed, the defender prevails; the aggressor labors, the defender rests; advancing is arrogant, retreating is humble; advancing is hasty, retreating is composed. To meet reversal with compliance, to meet labor with rest, to meet arrogance with humility, to meet haste with composure—these are not to be opposed. This is so because the Dao’s constant principle arises from non-action; thus its movement always arises from being pressed, and its victory always comes through non-contention—even in warfare, it is no different.\n\nIf one truly knows that action arises from non-action, then my conduct is always without conduct, my pushing is always without arms, my opposition is always without resistance, my grasp is always without weapons—where then can I not triumph? If one cannot act from non-action, knowing only the aggressor but not the defender, knowing only advance but not retreat, this is called underestimating the enemy. To underestimate the enemy risks losing what I hold dear—my treasures. Hence it is said: *\"No greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy; to underestimate the enemy risks losing my treasures.\"* Only those who triumph through non-contention cannot be defeated; hence it is said: *\"When armies clash, the compassionate shall prevail.\"*\n\n**Chapter Seventy: The Dao’s Simplicity**\n\nMy words are very easy to know, very easy to act upon.\nYet none under heaven can know them, none can act upon them.\nWords have a root; affairs have a lord.\nIt is only because of ignorance that they do not know me.\nFew know me, and thus I am held in high regard.\nTherefore the Sage appears in humble garb while treasuring virtue.\n\nThe Classics say: *\"The Dao follows natural law; its words are rare yet natural.\"* Naturalness means non-action; thus to know and act upon it is not difficult. Yet none under heaven can know or act—why is this? Because words have a root, and affairs have a lord, yet none under heaven knows their root or lord, and thus they do not know me.\n\nWhat is the root? Non-action yet naturalness—that is the root of words. From this root, though words may differ, they are but branches and descendants—how can there be those who do not know? What is the lord? Non-action yet naturalness—that is the lord of affairs. To grasp the lord and govern it, though affairs may differ, they are but servants—how can there be those who cannot act?\n\nIt is only because they do not know the root and the lord that they do not know me. The Dao’s reason for being held in high regard by all under heaven is that it cannot be known by knowing, cannot be recognized by recognition—thus it is held in high regard. If the Dao could be known by knowing and recognized by recognition, what would be its worth? Hence it is said: *\"Few know me, and thus I am held in high regard.\"* Therefore the Sage appears with the guise of humiliation and folly, yet within holds great virtue and splendor—this is called *\"wearing coarse cloth while treasuring jade.\"*\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**\n\nKnowing the unknown—this is the highest.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One (continued): Knowing the Unknown**\n\nNot knowing the known—this is illness.\nOnly by being ill of illness does one not fall ill.\nThe Sage does not fall ill because he is ill of illness, and thus does not fall ill.\nThe Classic says: *\"The Dao in its essence is that which is unknown yet knows.\"*\n\nTo know one’s own ignorance and yet act as if knowing—this is the pinnacle of knowing.\nThus it is said: *Not knowing the known is illness.*\n\nEven if one knows one’s ignorance yet acts as if knowing, will not one’s mind be mediocre and at ease?\nThus it is said: *Not knowing the known is illness.*\n\nOnly by being ill of the illness of knowing does one turn back to non-knowing, and then knowing is no longer sufficient to make one ill.\nThus it is said: *Only by being ill of illness does one not fall ill.*\n\nThe Sage does not fall ill—this is all.\nThus it is said: *Because he is ill of illness, he does not fall ill.*\n\nSouthward Child Qi said:\n*\"I pity those who lose themselves.\nI also pity those who pity those who lose themselves.\nI also pity those who pity those who pity those who lose themselves—\nand so it recedes day by day.\nIf one such as Child Tai, can he be called one who is ill of illness?\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear Authority**\n\nThe people do not fear authority—then great authority arrives.\nDo not constrain their dwelling, do not exhaust their livelihood.\nOnly because one does not exhaust it, is it not exhausted.\nThus the Sage knows himself yet does not reveal himself,\nloves himself yet does not exalt himself—\nand so he discards that to take this.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The people are not blind to the Dao,\nyet they only esteem knowledge and recognition,\nand thus life flourishes thickly.\nLife flourishes thickly,\nso death is held lightly.\nDeath is held lightly,\nso authority is not feared.\nWhen the people reach the point of not fearing authority,\nthey will do whatever they please—\nthis is how Heaven itself makes its authority manifest\nand greatly unleashes its punishments.\nThus it is said: The people do not fear authority—then great authority arrives.\"*\n\nOnly those who govern by the Dao know\nthat it fills Heaven and Earth, embraces the six extremes,\nand all that is granted by Heaven shares this same dwelling—\ndo not constrain it, that is all.\nQi and spirit flow freely in all directions, reaching everywhere—\nall that is granted by Heaven shares this same life—\ndo not exhaust it, that is all.\n\nThe people are not constant; it depends on me alone.\nOnly because I do not exhaust it, the people also do not exhaust it—\nthen why should they not fear authority?\n\nThus the Sage knows himself with constancy\nyet does not reveal himself through external display,\nknows constancy yet transcends his own body—\nthis is how he does not constrain their dwelling.\nHe loves himself with moderation\nyet does not exalt himself to forfeit his life—\nloving sound yet forfeiting his life—\nthis is how he does not exhaust their livelihood.\n\nThus he discards the illness of knowledge\nand takes this non-recognition, non-knowing non-illness.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Three: Courage in Not-Daring**\n\nCourage in daring leads to death;\ncourage in not-daring leads to life.\nKnowing these two—sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful.\nWhat Heaven abhors—who can know its reason?\n\nThus the Sage finds it difficult.\nThe Way of Heaven does not contend yet wins well,\ndoes not speak yet responds well,\ndoes not summon yet comes of its own accord,\nopen yet plans well.\n\nThe net of Heaven is vast, sparse yet nothing is lost.\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Those who are rigid and clash with external things—\nthese are the daring, and they are doomed to death.\nThus it is said: Courage in daring leads to death.\nThose who are yielding and have no fixed course—\nthese are the not-daring, and they are doomed to life.\nThus it is said: Courage in not-daring leads to life.*\n\nCourage in daring is seen as beneficial by people,\nyet harm may lie within it.\nCourage in not-daring is seen as harmful by people,\nyet benefit may lie within it.\nThus Heaven’s abhorrence—\nperhaps it cannot be known by knowing and recognized by recognition.\nThus it is said: These two—sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful—\nHeaven’s abhorrence, who knows its reason?\n\nThus when the Sage acts,\nhe proceeds cautiously as if crossing a river in winter,\nhe fears his neighbors as if they were enemies—\nhe finds it difficult to this extent,\nbecause Heaven’s abhorrence is unknowable.\nOnly because it is unknowable,\ndoes non-recognition and non-knowing\nbecome the way to follow Heaven’s pattern.\n\nHeaven in creating things\nnurtures them according to their nature—\nsupporting the upright, overturning the tilted—\nyet it never contends with things,\nand yet nothing can defy it.\nThus it is said: *It does not contend yet wins well.*\n\nWhat does Heaven speak of?\nThe four seasons proceed in it,\na hundred creatures live in it—\ntheir proceeding, their living,\nnever deviates.\nThus it is said: *It does not speak yet responds well.*\n\nThat which no one does yet is done—this is Heaven.\nThat which no one summons yet arrives—this is Fate.\nThus it is said: *It does not summon yet comes of its own accord.*\n\nThe easy is easy to know,\nyet its Way of fullness and emptiness\nrises and falls with the times—\nnever deviating.\nThus it is said: *Open yet plans well.*\n\nHeaven’s wisdom and clarity come from the people’s wisdom and clarity,\nHeaven’s manifest authority comes from the people’s manifest authority—\nyet its wisdom and authority are never self-applied,\nand blessings and calamities follow like echoes—\nthus it is said: *The net of Heaven is vast, sparse yet nothing is lost.*\n\nOnly because Heaven’s Way is thus unknowable,\ndoes the Sage dare in not-daring,\nnot recognizing, not knowing—\nand thus knows how to follow it.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Four: The People Do Not Normally Fear Death**\n\nThe people do not normally fear death—\nwhy use death to frighten them?\nIf one were to make people always fear death\nand act strangely because of it,\nI could seize and kill them—who would dare?\n\nThere are always those who execute killings,\nand those who replace them in killing—\nthis is like a substitute carpenter wielding the axe.\nA substitute carpenter wielding the axe—\nfew escape uninjured.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The people’s Way is naturally one of not fearing death.\nOnly by not constraining their dwelling,\nnot exhausting their livelihood,\ncan one make them fear authority and hold death in reverence—\nwhy use death to frighten them and wish them to fear death?\nHow do I know this is so?\"*\n\nIf one forces the people to always fear death and act recklessly,\nthen I could seize and kill them—who would dare not fear death and act recklessly?\n\nYet if one seizes them but cannot overpower them,\nand kills them but the killings do not cease,\nthen it is clear that the people do not fear death\nand cannot be made to fear it through death.\n\nThen, if one governs the world through the Dao,\nhow should one proceed?\n\nLet there always be those who execute killings,\nand do not substitute for them—that is all.\n\nWhat does \"let there always be those who execute killings\" mean?\nThe Heavenly Net is vast and all-encompassing,\nyet its mesh is wide and it does not lose a single thread.\nHeaven punishes the guilty with the Five Punishments and Five Uses—\nthese are the ones who execute killings, spoken of as Heaven itself.\n\nIf punishments and executions arise from personal likes and dislikes\nrather than being applied according to Heaven’s retribution,\nthen this is substituting for those who execute killings.\n\nTo substitute for those who execute killings\nis like a substitute carpenter wielding the axe.\nA substitute carpenter wielding the axe—\nfew escape uninjured.\nThus, the harm of substituting for those who execute killings is evident.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-Five: The People’s Hunger**\n\nThe people’s hunger arises from their rulers taking too much in taxes.\nThus, they hunger.\nThe people are difficult to govern because their rulers act excessively.\nThus, they are difficult to govern.\nPeople grow careless about death because their sustenance is abundant.\nThus, they grow careless about death.\nOnly those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"If one man’s labor is enough to feed several households,\nwhy should there be hunger at all?\nYet hunger arises—is it not because their rulers take too much in taxes?\nThey weave to clothe themselves and till to feed themselves—\nthis is called harmony of virtue (*tóngdé*).\nWhy should they be difficult to govern?\nYet they become difficult to govern—is it not because their rulers act excessively?\nIf their food is sweet, their clothing fine, their customs settled,\nand their dwellings pleasant,\nwhy should they grow careless about death?\nYet they grow careless about death—is it not because their sustenance is abundant,\nand thus they grow careless about death?\"*\n\nTherefore, the Sage does nothing and the people grow rich,\ndesires nothing and the people return to simplicity.\nThus, there is no hunger from excessive taxation.\nWith no action, the people transform themselves;\nwith a love of stillness, the people align themselves.\nThus, there is no difficulty in governance from excessive action.\nSelf-enrichment, self-simplicity, self-transformation, self-alignment—\nwhen these exist, there is no hunger or difficulty in governance,\nand thus no carelessness about death from abundant sustenance.\n\nIt is because of their grasping for knowledge, their scheming for gain,\nand their insatiable striving that people reach such abundance\nand grow careless about death.\nIf one does not cling to life,\nit is clear that this is wiser than prizing life.\n\nThus, the Sage does not flaunt himself nor does he burden himself with responsibility,\nknowing only that one must not cling to life.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-Six: On Human Life**\n\nHuman life is soft and weak,\nbut death is hard and strong.\nGrass and trees are soft and brittle when alive,\nbut dry and withered when dead.\nThus, the hard and strong belong to death,\nwhile the soft and weak belong to life.\nTherefore, strong armies do not conquer,\nand rigid trees are easily felled.\nThe hard and strong dwell below,\nwhile the soft and weak dwell above.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The Dao, as a thing, is formless yet does not contend—\nHeaven’s ultimate softness and weakness,\nyet no one comprehends it.\nThus, I use things with form to illustrate it.*\n\nHuman life is soft and weak,\nbut death is hard and strong.\nGrass and trees are soft and brittle when alive,\nbut dry and withered when dead—\neven things with form die hard and strong,\nand live soft and weak.\nHow much more so the Dao, which is formless,\nif it does not maintain its softness and weakness?\nIs this possible?\n\nThus, strong armies rely on their strength and grow arrogant,\nbecoming the target of enemy schemes.\nIf I am arrogant and the enemy schemes,\nthen this is why I do not conquer.\nRigid trees are felled—\nthis is why they are easily uprooted and carried away.\nIt is not without reason.\n\nYet speaking in terms of position:\nHeaven’s *qi* dwells above, while Earth’s form dwells below.\n*Qi* is soft and weak, while form is hard and strong.\nThe minister acts through deeds for the ruler,\nwhile the ruler governs through non-action to nurture the people.\nAction is hard and strong, while non-action is soft and weak.\nThe hard and strong dwell below, the soft and weak dwell above—\nthis is the natural order of things.\nThus, it is clear that the soft and weak can overcome the hard and strong.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven: The Dao of Heaven**\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Dao of Heaven**\n\nThe Dao of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nThe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,\nBut the Dao of humanity does otherwise—\nIt diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho then can use their excess to nourish the world?\nOnly the one in accord with the Dao.\n\nThus, the Sage acts but does not rely upon it,\nCompletes the deed but does not dwell upon it—\nWhy does he not wish to be seen as virtuous?\nThe Classic says: *The Dao of Heaven is simply non-action.*\nNon-action means no partiality,\nNo partiality means balance—\nJust as with drawing a bow:\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nThe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented,\nAnd all is brought to balance.\n\nNow, the Dao of Heaven does not deliberately lower the high or raise the low;\nIt simply follows non-action, letting things take their natural course.\nThus, the high become excessive and must be diminished,\nThe low become deficient and must be supplemented.\nFullness invites diminishment, humility invites increase—\nThis is the working of Heaven’s Dao.\n\nHumanity cannot practice non-action,\nCannot practice non-action, then cannot avoid partiality,\nCannot avoid partiality, then it comes to diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive—\nWhich is no different.\n\nOnly the one in accord with the Dao\nKnows that before anything arises, all deeds and names are my own excess,\nWhile the world’s deficiencies struggle and contend.\nThus, he diminishes his excess to nourish the world without claiming it,\nAnd it is said: *Only the one in accord with the Dao can diminish his excess to nourish the world.*\nThe Sage is the one in accord with the Dao,\nAnd so he acts but does not rely upon it,\nCompletes the deed but does not dwell upon it—\nNot because he does not wish to be seen as virtuous,\nBut simply because he follows the Dao of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Soft and Weak of the World**\n\nNothing in the world is as soft and weak as water,\nYet nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong.\nHeaven uses this to transform it.\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong—\nAll know this, yet none can practice it.\n\nTherefore, the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the world’s impurities is to be called the master of the state and soil;\nTo bear the world’s misfortunes is to be called the king of the world.\"*\nThis is *straight speech as if reversed.*\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Of all things in the world, only water can\nFollow the contours of the crooked and straight, the round and square—\nThus, nothing is as soft and weak as water.\nYet it flows past great objects,\nTurns great stones,\nPierces hills and valleys,\nFloats and bears the weight of Heaven and Earth—\nOnly water can do this,\nThus, nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong.\nThis is so because, though it bends and twists in myriad ways,\nIt never loses its essence as water—\nAnd so there is nothing that can alter it.\"*\n\nThough water is soft and weak,\nAnd though all know that the soft and weak can overcome the hard and strong,\nLaozi repeatedly emphasizes this—why?\nBecause though all know it, none can practice it.\n\nThe clever and insightful may presume to govern,\nYet their flaw lies not in lacking strength,\nBut in their inability to diminish their excess to nourish the world,\nTo hold fast to the soft and weak,\nAnd to avoid being burdened by names, titles, wisdom, and the schemes of ministers and officials.\nThus, when Laozi concludes his discourse on *Dao* and *virtue*,\nHe repeatedly returns to this teaching,\nAnd cites the Sage’s words to affirm it:\n*\"To bear the world’s impurities is to be called the master of the state and soil;\nTo bear the world’s misfortunes is to be called the king of the world.\"*\nThis makes clear that the way to serve the world lies here, not there.\n\nNow, the kings of the Three Dynasties first sought fame,\nYet they said: *\"To bear the world’s impurities and misfortunes—\nThis is to be the master of the state and soil, the king of the world.\"*\nWhy?\nBecause those who seek fame before its time\nAre neither excessive in their words nor deficient—\nTo bear the world’s impurities and misfortunes\nIs to exceed the bounds of fame,\nFor fame cannot encompass it.\nDeficient speech responds to circumstances,\nCircumstantial speech varies with events.\nExcessive speech embodies the Dao,\nDao-embodying speech is true.\nThus, *straight speech as if reversed*—\nThe words of Tang and Wu say:\n*\"All under Heaven has guilt, resting upon me alone.\"*\nThis is the one who knows how to bear the world’s impurities and misfortunes.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine: Harmonizing Great Grievances**\n\nTo harmonize great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances—\nHow then can this be called good?\nThus, the Sage holds the left contract but does not demand repayment from others.\nTherefore, the virtuous oversee the contract,\nThe unvirtuous oversee the execution.\nHeaven’s Dao has no favorites—\nIt always sides with the good.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"One who seeks vengeance does not break the ancestral tablet,\nThough harboring resentment, they do not blame the falling tiles.\"*\nThus, the world is balanced.\n\nWithout this Dao, grievances arise,\nAnd though people seek to harmonize them, the entanglements cannot be undone—\nHence, *to harmonize great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances.*\nThe unvirtuous, I also treat with virtue—\nThis is how virtue is cultivated.\nYet to harmonize great grievances while still leaving lingering ones—\nHow can this be called good?\n\nThus, the Sage holds the left contract but does not demand repayment from others—\nThis ensures that those seeking vengeance do not break the ancestral tablet,\nThough harboring resentment, they do not blame the falling tiles,\nAnd the world is balanced in this way.\n\nIn ancient times, when presenting chariots and horses,\nThe right contract was held—\nThe right contract was for taking,\nThe left contract was for giving—\nThus, the left contract was always given to others and never kept.\nThe Sage acts but does not rely upon it,\nCompletes the deed but does not dwell upon it,\nAlways using his excess to nourish the world,\nYet when it comes to killing, he lets the proper officials execute it\nAnd never takes the blame himself—\nThis is holding the left contract to give to others\nWithout claiming ownership,\nAnd so there is no grievance and no demand for repayment.\n\nIs this because he takes pleasure in harmonizing?\nThus, the virtuous oversee the contract—\nThey simply do not demand repayment from others.\n\nWithout virtue to oversee the contracts, those who merely facilitate transactions are its agents.\n\nThe Dao/Way has no favorites—\nIt always aligns with the virtuous.\nWithout favoritism, it bestows upon the virtuous alone—\nThis too is holding the left contract without demanding repayment from others.\n\n**Chapter Eighty of *Small States, Few People***\n\nIn small states with few people,\nLet there be tenfold or hundredfold implements yet unused,\nLet the people hold life dear and not wander far.\nThough there be boats and carriages,\nThey shall have no use for them;\nThough there be armor and weapons,\nThey shall have no place to deploy them.\nLet the people return to knotted cords for record-keeping.\nLet their food be simple, their garments plain,\nTheir dwellings secure, their customs joyful.\nNeighboring states, though visible, hear only the sounds of roosters and dogs,\nAnd the people live out their days to old age without crossing borders.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nFrom the Three Dynasties onward until the decline of Zhou,\nIts culture grew ever more decadent,\nAnd the people lost their natural way of life.\nThus Laozi’s words restore simplicity#1,\nTo return to the governance of primordial antiquity.\n\nIn small states with few people,\nLet there be tenfold or hundredfold implements yet unused,\nLet the people hold life dear and not wander far.\nThough there be boats and carriages,\nThey shall have no use for them;\nThough there be armor and weapons,\nThey shall have no place to deploy them.\n\nThis is the restoration of simplicity to return to the Dao of primordial antiquity.\n\nZhuang Zhou spoke of the age of supreme virtue, saying:\n\nIn the time of Rongcheng Shi, Datingshi, Boyuangshi, Zhongyangshi, Lülùshi, Lixushi, Xuanyuanshi, Hèxūshi, Zūnlúshi, Zhùróngshi, Fúxi Shi, and Shennong Shi—\nat that time, the people used knotted cords for record-keeping,\nfound their food sweet, their garments fine,\ntook joy in their customs, and dwelled securely.\nNeighboring states, though visible, heard only the sounds of roosters and dogs,\nand the people lived out their days to old age without crossing borders.\n\nThus, what was spoken of was not merely Laozi’s words alone—\nancient times already held this Dao.\n\nYet the *Shijing* and *Shujing* speak only of Yao, Shun, and the Three Dynasties,\nwhile Laozi sought to return to the governance of primordial antiquity—why so?\n\nIt is said: The Dao and the world have long been mutually lost.\nOnly the Great Dao can restore humanity to its natural way.\nTo speak of the Dao without reference to its age is insufficient to know\nthat the Great Dao has been tested.\nThis is why he again turns to the governance of primordial antiquity.\n\nYet if the world has long departed from antiquity,\ncan it be fully restored?\n\nIt is said: Not yet possible.\nThen what is the purpose of his words?\n\nThe rites reached their fullest expression in the harmonization of the Three Sovereigns,\nand music attained its completeness in the perfection of the Six Dynasties.\nYet though their forms were perfected,\nthe rites did not place *xuanshui* and *dajeng* above *lizhou* and harmonized soups,\nnor did music elevate the *zhui* flute’s pure tones above the *zhusheng*’s resonant strings—\nfor this was to make people understand\nthat the intent of rites and music lay in what they could not avoid,\nwhile their true aim was to return to origins and begin anew.\n\nAt that very time,\nConfucius sought to restore and continue the fallen traditions of Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou,\nwhile Laozi expounded his Dao and its relation to the world in this very way—\nhis intent was no different.\n\nIt is like the moon reaching the *Wei* stem while Fire’s reign begins,\nyet the *jin* qi has already arisen within—\nthis is how the Five Phases succeed one another without interruption.\n\nThus, when one hears of ancient governance,\nthough there were ten or a hundred implements, they were not used,\nthough there were boats and carriages, they were not ridden,\nthough there were armor and weapons, they were not displayed—\nyet when great matters arose and great multitudes were gathered,\nit was only because there was no alternative.\n\nWhen one hears that the people used knotted cords for records,\nand neighboring states were within sight and hearing,\nyet grew old and died without crossing borders—\nthen the burdensome laws and exhaustive decrees,\nthe relentless inspections and urgent summonses,\nthe roads stretching to the borders of neighboring states,\nthe chariot tracks extending a thousand miles—\nthese were not by choice, but necessity.\n\nThus, what was unavoidable was always here,\nwhile what was sung of was always there—\nso why would one trouble oneself with excessive governance to correct the people’s faults?\n\nYet if one seeks to prevent the world from attaining peace and prosperity,\nit cannot be done.\n\nIf one cuts off the discussion, it is as if one were removing *xuanshui* and discarding *shuyue*—\nwho would then know the true intent of rites in their simplicity,\nor that music’s moderation was meant to return to origins and begin anew?\n\nThe words of the Sage—\nhow could they be mere trifling corrections?\n\n---\n**Chapter Eighty-One: Trustworthy Speech**\n\nTrustworthy speech is not ornate,\nornate speech is not trustworthy.\nThe virtuous do not argue,\nthose who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not learned,\nthe learned are not wise.\nThe Sage has no accumulation—\nwhen he gives to others, he grows ever more abundant,\nwhen he shares with others, he grows ever more plentiful.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming,\nthe Dao of the Sage acts without contending.\nIt is said:\n*The Dao as a thing—*\nyou cannot see it, cannot hear it, cannot grasp it,\nyet it can be silently understood—\nnot through reasoning, but through direct attunement.\n\nThus, trustworthy speech is trust in this alone—\nwhy bother with ornate speech?\nOrnate speech is skill in this alone—\nwhy bother with argumentation?\nWise speech is knowledge of this alone—\nwhy bother with breadth?\n\nFrom this perspective,\nit is clear that ornate speech is untrustworthy,\nargumentation is unvirtuous,\nand breadth is unwise—\nfor they do not align with the Dao.\n\nThe Dao as a thing\nhas never been a thing at all.\nThe Sage, in harmony with the Dao,\nhow could he have any accumulation?\nOnly because he has no accumulation\ndoes he become one with all things.\nWhen all things become one with him,\nhe is supremely rich—\nthus, when he gives to others, he grows ever more abundant,\nwhen he shares with others, he grows ever more plentiful.\n\nIf he had accumulation,\nits use would have limits—\nhow could he grow ever more abundant and ever more plentiful?\n\nLaozi’s words—\nobserving inwardly into the heart,\nobserving outwardly into things,\ngazing upward to Heaven,\ngazing downward to Earth—\nnothing escapes his attunement—\nthis is trustworthiness.\n\nYet the lesser scholar hears and scoffs,\nthe world deems him unworthy—\nthis is unornate speech.\nHis words are closest yet point farthest—\nthis is virtue.\nYet he does not speak for pleasure—\nthis is non-argumentation.\nHis wisdom reaches the state of no-wisdom—\nthis is wisdom.\nYet his simplicity never strays from the heart—\nthis is not breadth.\n\nBut scholars seek it through ornate speech, argumentation, and breadth—\nthey stray far.\n\nThe Dao of Laozi\nconsiders accumulation insufficient—\neven the Sage abandons and rejects it—\nthis is non-accumulation,\nthus, in utter emptiness, he fulfills all things’ demands—\nthis is growing ever more abundant and ever more plentiful.\n\nYet scholars, unable to focus their hearts upon this,\ncannot attain it.\n\nAll things have what benefits them and what does not—\nwhat does not benefit them cannot but bring harm.\nOnly the Dao of Heaven,\nhaving nothing that benefits, has nothing that does not benefit—\nhaving nothing that does not benefit, it benefits without harm.\n\nAll things that act\ninevitably have self—\nhaving self, they contend.\nOnly the Dao of the Sage,\nthough acting, does nothing—\ndoing nothing, it has no self—\nhaving no self, it does not contend—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven alone.\n\n---\n**End of Volume Four of the *Daodejing* Transmission**\n---\n*#1* \"Rescue with sincerity\" [疑作『救之以质』]\n*#2* \"Why bother with

      "translated_text": "**Preface to the *Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***\n\nYour subject Huiqing respectfully states: I have heard that when Cook Ding presented his blade, he attained the art of nurturing life before Lord Wenhui; when Wheelwright Bian laid down his chisel, he debated the reading of books before Duke Huan of Qi. If one’s aspiration remains undivided, the Dao may yet be found.\n\nWith utmost reverence and trepidation, I bow my head again and again.\n\nI humbly observe that the great system has scattered amid the falsity of cleverness, and all living beings have lost their original nature and emotions. Thus arose the True Person, who illuminated the supreme teaching, tracing its origin solely to the Dao and its virtue, and venerating the ancient canons. Hence, when Zhuang Zhou spoke of the age when \"chickens and dogs could be heard\" in one another’s villages, he referred to the time of Shennong and before; when the *Classic of Master Lie* declared the \"Valley Spirit never dies,\" it attributed the work to the Yellow Emperor. Probing its subtle words, one finds wondrous things within. Vague and indistinct, they elude sight and hearing; neither ancient nor modern, their beginning and end defy comprehension. To lose them is to drift ever farther, like the supreme treasure hidden on Mount Ke, unknown to all; to grasp them is to have them come unbidden, like the Dark Pearl sought through *Xiangwang* and thus obtained.\n\nThe land of Huaxu visited by the Yellow Emperor, the Mount Gushe of Tang Yao—both mark the utmost journeys, leading to perfect tranquility. The intent of this book differs not from such attainments. When Cao Can studied under Master Gai and governed Qi, when Emperor Wen of Han transmitted the teachings of the *Heshang* and founded his dynasty, they grasped but the surface, yet still approached peace and prosperity.\n\nAlas, vulgar learning fails to recognize the truth of the Dao. It sees only that the text differs from the traces of the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, unaware that its meaning is the very foundation of emperors and kings. Thus, when it hears \"not exalting the worthy,\" it assumes they are abandoned in the wild; when it reads \"not prizing goods,\" it thinks they are cast aside unused. It takes \"abolishing learning\" to mean ignorance like that of beasts and calves, and \"abolishing sageliness\" to mean lawlessness like that of primordial chaos. It does not know that within the numinous chamber, even gold dust, if left to accumulate, will dim the radiance of the spirit. Therefore, the book casts aside both good and evil to reach the ultimate unity of emptiness and tranquility. Such depths are hard to fathom, and rightly so—it befuddles the wise.\n\nThus, these trustworthy words of the sagely one have been ranked among the treasured teachings of the Hundred Schools. To expound this subtle learning should be the task of the most divine.\n\nI prostrate myself before Your Imperial Majesty, who, possessing the essence of a perfected transcendent, has emerged to serve as sovereign and teacher, and whose overflowing marvelous root has taken form in great undertakings. You have rectified governance so that all affairs flourish, and reformed the age so that the Four Quarters place their trust in you. Now, you will align heart and form, shedding the burdens of governing things and nurturing the self; you will deepen the root and strengthen the stem to enter the gate of long life and enduring vision. You will unite the world with the land of Huaxu and behold the divine person on Mount Gushe. To reach the utmost of this attainment is most fitting for this time.\n\nYour subject, by nature dull and ignorant, was born to endure hardship. Ever aspiring to the clarity of dawn, I sought to dispel the obstinacy of Heaven. Casting my gaze widely, I examined its scattered and disparate aspects, then pared them away to seek their underlying unity. Time has been insufficient, and years have passed thus. Only lately, in these writings, have I suddenly felt as though I had gained something. Moving toward stillness, the myriad things return to their root; from turbidity to clarity, the dark center reveals the dawn. Thus, I have expressed my understanding in words. Though I call this self-contentment, I know not if it is fitting.\n\nI humbly regard the tranquil insight of the perfected person as the primal mirror for scholars. Daring to presume upon your attention, I offer this to discern its worth. Like the dragon’s scattered chapters, it is difficult to know its ascent to Heaven; yet, as the horse’s focused intelligence may grasp the Dao through debate, if even a single word proves of use, I would not shrink from ten thousand deaths.\n\nThe work I have composed, *Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, comprises four fascicles. With utmost reverence, I present this memorial and submit it for your consideration.\n\nYour subject Huiqing, with utmost reverence and trepidation, bows his head again and again and respectfully speaks.\n\nFirst month of the first year of the Yuanfeng reign,\n*Zizhengdian* Academician, *Tong*...",

\"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\n\nThe Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\n\nEver without desire, one beholds its subtlety;\nEver with desire, one beholds its penetration.\n\nThese two, though issuing from the same source, bear different names—\nboth are called the Mysterious.\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—\nthe gateway through which all subtleties emerge.\n\nThe Commentary states:\nOf all the Dao in the world that can be spoken,\nnone is not the Dao—\nyet when it is spoken, it is perilous;\nthus it is the *non-eternal* Dao.\n\nOf all the names in the world that can be named,\nnone is not the *order*—\nyet when it is named, it is abandoned;\nthus it is the *non-eternal* Name.\n\nAll things flourish in their profusion,\neach returning to its root—\nyet they do not know it as *stillness*.\nStillness is called *returning to the primal command*;\nreturning to the primal command is called *constancy*.\n\nWhen one attains the Dao to *constancy*,\nthe mind congeals, the form dissolves,\nand self and objects are both forgotten—\nwho then knows the Dao that can be spoken\nor the Name that can be named?\n\nThus, the eternal Dao is indeed unspeakable,\nand so it is said:\n*\"The Dao endures long,\nand those who cling to it perish not.\"*\n\nThe eternal Name is indeed unnameable,\nand so it is said:\n*\"From ancient times to today,\nits Name does not fade.\"*\n\nNeither perishing nor fading—\nthis is called the eternal Dao.\n\nThe eternal Dao is without Name,\nand the Nameless is the Dao—\nthe origin from which Heaven and Earth first arose.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nAt the *Great Beginning*, there was the *Non-Being of Being*,\nand there was the *Nameless*.\nThe *Non-Being of Being* cannot be obtained,\nyet the *Nameless* is where the One arises—\nthe One before form took shape.\n\nOnce called the *One*,\nthough formless, it already bore a Name.\nThe Name is *One*,\nyet the one who names is *Two*—\nTwo and One make *Three*,\nand from this, all things proliferate.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The Named is the mother of all things.\"*\n\nTo know *constancy* is to be enlightened—\nenlightenment means seeing all things.\nThus, only *constancy* can be observed.\n\nWhen without desire,\nthe mind is pure, the vision profound, and flawless—\nhere one beholds its subtlety,\nand so it is said:\n*\"Ever without desire,\none may name its smallness.\"*\n\nWhen with desire,\nall things arise in profusion—\nhere one beholds its penetration,\nand so it is said:\n*\"All things return to it,\nyet they know no master—\none may name its greatness.\"*\n\nOnly through the small does one perceive its subtlety,\nonly through the great does one perceive its penetration.\n\nThese two, though issuing from the same source,\ndiffer only in name.\nTheir names differ,\nyet their essence does not truly differ.\nIf their essence does not truly differ,\nthen seeking their source—\ndesire and non-desire—\nboth cannot be obtained.\n\nIf they cannot be obtained,\nthen their source is the same—\nthus they are called the Mysterious.\n\nThe Mysterious as black aligns with red in unity;\nHeaven’s hue is Mysterious—\nyin and yang are one in unity.\nNames arise from the Mysterious—\ndesire and non-desire are one in unity.\n\nUnity is indeed subtle,\nyet subtle in unity is not yet subtle in multiplicity,\nsubtle in self is not yet subtle in things.\n\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—\nthen even the same cannot be obtained.\nIf the same cannot be obtained,\nthen One and Many, Self and Things—\nall are subtly manifest.\n\nThe subtlety of all things arises from this alone,\nand so it is said:\n*\"The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—\nthe gateway through which all subtleties emerge.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: \"When the World Knows Beauty\"**\n\nWhen the world knows beauty as beauty,\nthen ugliness already exists;\nwhen it knows goodness as goodness,\nthen wickedness already exists.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\ndifficulty and ease complete each other,\nlong and short define each other,\nhigh and low balance each other,\nharmony and discord resonate together,\nbefore and after follow each other.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without action,\nteaches without speech.\nAll things arise without resistance,\nare born without possession,\nare shaped without reliance,\nand when the work is done, takes no credit.\nOnly because they do not take credit\ndoes it not depart from them.\n\nThe Commentary states:\nWhen the world knows beauty as beauty and desires it,\nknows ugliness and wickedness as such and rejects them—\nyet speaking of them apart from the Dao,\neven beauty and goodness are distant from the Dao.\nSpeaking of them arising from the Dao,\neven ugliness and wickedness are not outside the Dao.\n\nThus observed,\nbeauty becomes ugliness,\ngoodness becomes wickedness—\nis this not true?\n\nTherefore, all things in the world arise from *being*,\nand *being* arises from *non-being*—\nthis is called the *interdependence of being and non-being*.\n\nDifficult tasks arise from ease,\nyet ease also arises from difficulty—\nthus there is no difficulty,\nand this is called the *completion of ease and difficulty*.\n\nWhen one knows the crane’s long stride,\nonly then does one know the hare’s short step;\nwhen one knows the hare’s short step,\nonly then does one know the crane’s long stride—\nthis is called the *definition of long and short*.\n\nIf high is taken as correct,\nthen all valleys are the source of rivers—\nhighness has what to lean upon low,\nand if low is taken as correct,\nthen rivers are the destination of all valleys—\nlow has what to lean upon high—\nthis is called the *balance of high and low*.\n\nThe yellow bell as master harmonizes the other tones,\nthe other tones as master harmonize the yellow bell—\nthis is called the *resonance of sounds*.\n\nFrom autumn and winter, one looks to spring and summer—\nthen spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow;\nfrom spring and summer, one looks to autumn and winter—\nthen autumn and winter come first, spring and summer follow—\nthis is called the *sequence of before and after*.\n\nAll these six pairs,\nwhen in their proper time and place,\nthe world calls them *beautiful* and *good*;\nwhen out of time and place,\nthe world calls them *ugly* and *wicked*.",

      "translated_text": "Now, who knows what is called *ultimate beauty* and *ultimate virtue*?\n\nFor beauty and ugliness, virtue and vice,\nthey merely alternate in their rise and fall—\nhow could they be constant?\n\nThus, the Sage, knowing this to be so,\nacts through the *Dao* in all things,\nyet his actions arise from *wuwei* [non-action].\nHe teaches through conventional names,\nyet his teaching arises from *non-speech*.\n\nWhen actions arise from *wuwei*,\nhe works all day yet never acts;\nwhen teaching arises from *non-speech*,\nhe speaks all day yet never speaks.\n\nThen beauty and ugliness, virtue and vice—\nwhy should I fix my heart upon them?\n\nIf this is so,\nthen wherever he goes, it is *wondrous*.\n\nIf wherever he goes is *wondrous*,\nthen the arising of all things—\nI do not see their arising or who makes them arise,\nI do not see their birth or who gives them birth,\nI do not see their making or who makes them.\n\nThus, though they arise or do not arise,\nthough they are born or not born,\nthough they are made or not made—\nwhat need have I for words, for possession, for reliance?\n\nThis is how *achievement is completed yet not dwelled upon*.\n\nIf one dwells upon it, then one must abandon it;\nif one does not dwell upon it within oneself,\nthen where could one abandon it?\n\n**Chapter Three: Not Esteeming the Virtuous**\nDo not esteem the virtuous, and the people will not contend;\ndo not prize hard-to-obtain goods, and the people will not steal;\ndo not display what is desirable, and the hearts of the people will not be disordered.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nempties their minds, fills their bellies,\nweakens their resolve, strengthens their bones.\nEver makes the people return to simplicity, to natural desires—\nso that the wise dare not act.\n\nIf one acts through *wuwei*,\nthen nothing will remain ungoverned.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nThe Sage knows that beauty is ugliness, virtue is vice,\nand I do not fix my heart upon them.\nThus, though I discard the world’s highest honors,\nI simply fulfill my duty—\nand the virtuous are not what I esteem.\nThough I gather the world’s wealth,\nI nourish virtue—\nand hard-to-obtain goods are not what I prize.\n\nThe people’s contentions\nalways arise from competing for virtue;\nknowing that virtue is not what the ruler esteems,\nthey will not contend.\nHence it is said: *\"To promote the virtuous is to make the people jostle.\"*\n\nThe people’s theft\nalways arises from desire for profit;\nknowing that wealth is not what the ruler prizes,\nthey will not steal.\nHence it is said: *\"If the child does not desire it,\nthough you reward him, he will not steal.\"*\n\nWhat the noble seeks is virtue;\nwhat the petty seeks is wealth.\nIf I do not show what is desirable,\nthen their hearts will not be disordered.\n\nYet this is not to abandon the virtuous in the wilds and not use them,\nnor to discard hard-to-obtain goods and leave them on the ground.\nIt is simply that internally, I do not harbor them in my heart,\nand externally, I do not leave their traces behind.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nempties their minds, fills their bellies,\nweakens their resolve, strengthens their bones.\nThe mind houses the *shen* [spirit], and the belly is the mind’s dwelling—\nif the mind is emptied, the *shen* is undiminished and the belly is filled.\nThe kidneys house the will, and the bones are the kidneys’ remnant—\nif the will is weakened, the *jing* [essence] is unshaken and the bones are strong.\n\nIf the mind is emptied while the belly is filled,\nthen the people are ever kept in simplicity.\nIf the will is weakened while the bones are strengthened,\nthen the people are ever kept without desire.\n\nThe wise, knowing that virtue is not what the ruler esteems\nand that wealth is not what the ruler prizes,\nwill not act for what is not profitable—\nthus they dare not act.\n\nOnly in this way\ndoes *wuwei* prevail,\nand governance is naturally achieved.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Effortlessness**\nThe Dao is effortless yet effective;\nblunting its sharpness, it is never full.\n\nDeep, it seems the origin of all things.\nBlunting its sharpness, resolving its entanglements,\nsoftening its brilliance, blending with dust—\nserene, it seems as if it might exist.\n\nI do not know whose child it is—\nit precedes the *Imperial Sovereign*.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nAll things carry *yin* while embracing *yang*,\nand the interplay of *qi* brings harmony.\nThus, the *effortless*—\nthis is the harmony of *yin* and *yang*.\n\n*Yin* is emptiness, *yang* is fullness;\nthe essence of the Dao is effortless,\nyet its application may not be full.\n\nIts essence is effortless,\nso having or lacking desire is called *mystery*.\n\nIts application is not full,\nso the mind is emptied and the will weakened,\never keeping the people without knowledge or desire.\n\nOnly in this way\ndoes it seem the origin of all things,\nyet seeking what makes it the origin—\nit is fundamentally unattainable;\nonly its semblance remains.\n\nThen how does one attain this Dao?\nBy blunting its sharpness, resolving its entanglements,\nsoftening its brilliance, blending with dust.\n\nWhen the mind exits and enters things, that is sharpness—\nblunt its sharpness and do not act.\nWhen things arrive and engage the mind, that is entanglement—\nresolve its entanglements and do not disturb.\n\nWhen sharpness is blunted and entanglements resolved,\nthe clarity of the constant shines forth from Heaven’s light.\n\nLight is beyond dust;\ndwelling in light without obscurity,\nit is harmonized yet not distinguished.\nDust is within light;\ndwelling in dust without dimness,\nit is blended yet not differentiated.\n\nOnly in this way\ndoes that which is called the origin\nseem as if it might exist.\n\n*Deep*—this speaks of its profundity.\n*Serene*—this speaks of its clarity.\n*Not full*—this is not a fixed emptiness.\n*Seems to exist*—this is not a fixed existence.\n\nEmptiness, fullness, existence, nonexistence—\nI do not fix my heart upon them,\nso how could I know their source of origin?\n\nI only see their birth from the Heavenly *shen* and the *Imperial Sovereign*—\nthus it is said: *I do not know whose child it is; it precedes the Imperial Sovereign.*\n\nIf there is *I*, *knowing*, *who*—\nthen the Dao is hidden.\nIf I do not know *who*,\nthen I also do not know *myself*—\nthis is the origin from which the true Dao emerges.\n\nIt precedes the Heavenly with its form,\nit precedes the *Imperial Sovereign* with its beginning—\nthus its status as prior to all form and instrument is clear.\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent;\nthey treat all things as *chúgǒu* [sacrificial dogs].\nThe Sage is not benevolent;\nhe treats the people as *chúgǒu*.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nis it not like discarding a broken key?\n\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever producing.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion;\nbetter to hold to the central way.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nThe Dao is obscure before the *Imperial Sovereign’s* form,\nand one does not know from whom it originates.\nThus, those who embody this Dao—\nhow could *benevolence* suffice to name them?",

benevolence,\ntreating all things as *chúgǒu*.\nThe Sage embodies this Dao—\nthey do not act from benevolence,\ntreating the people as *chúgǒu*.\n\nThe *chúgǒu* is but an object\nthat is kept without benevolence.\n\nAll things are of the same body as Heaven and Earth.\nThe people are of the same body as the Sage.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth regard themselves as *chúgǒu*,\nthen their regard for all things and the people is no different.\nThus, to nurture and raise them—\nwhat need is there for benevolence?\n\nOnly the non-benevolent\ncan be called the Great Benevolence.\n\nThus, it is clear that between Heaven and Earth,\nit is indeed like discarding a broken key.\n\nFor the discarded key—\nits emptiness yet unyielding,\nits motion yet ever producing—\nis how it moves and yet endures.\n\nThus, the person who embodies this Dao\nspeaks from the unsaid alone.\n\nTo speak without speaking\nis to know *wuwei* [non-action].\n\nWhen sound manifests, it becomes speech;\nwhen action manifests, it becomes deed.\nTo speak or act—\nin essence, they are one.\n\nWhy?\nSpeech and deed share the same body—\nsuch is their nature.\n\nIf one does not know this,\nthen speech does not arise from the unsaid.\nSpeech not arising from the unsaid\ndeviates from the empty motion of the discarded key—\nthus, its excess and exhaustion are inevitable.\n\nConfucius said:\nWho among today’s singers understands this?\nTo know this is to know that speech arises from the unsaid.\n\nSpeech arises from the unsaid—\nno one escapes this truth.\nYet those who cannot grasp it\nfail to align their hearts\nwith the *You* [having] rather than the *Wu* [non-being],\nwith the *Qu* [taking] rather than the *Shi* [gathering].\nThey cannot harmonize with the Dao.\n\nTo neither have nor not have,\nto neither take nor gather,\nyet to harmonize with the Dao—\nthis is called *holding to the central way*.\n\nTo hold to the central way without ceasing\nis to know the purpose of speech.\nThus, much speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to make *holding to the central way* one’s duty.\n\nHence it is said:\nThe human heart is ever perilous,\nthe Dao-heart ever subtle.\nOnly the precise and singular\ncan steadfastly grasp the central way.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**\n\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the *Xuàn Dàn* [Mysterious Feminine].\nThe *Xuàn Dàn’s* gate—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nEndless, as if it exists,\nyet its use is effortless.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nThe *Gǔ* [Valley] is the formed—\nby obtaining *One*, it is empty yet full.\nThe *Shén* [Spirit] is the formless—\nby obtaining *One*, it is still yet responsive.\n\nThe person who can hold to the central way and obtain *One*\ncan make the formed body as empty as the *Gǔ*,\nthe formless heart as still as the *Shén*—\nthen the formed and formless unite, and death does not come.\n\nThe ancients aligned body with heart,\nheart with *qi*,\n*qi* with Spirit,\nSpirit with the *Wu* [Non-being].\nTheir teaching is this:\n\nTo unite is to not die;\nto not die is to not be born;\nthe unborn can give birth to all things—\nthis is called the *Xuàn Dàn*.\n\nThe *Xuàn* is the union of *You* and *Wu*.\nThe *Dàn* is the giver of life.\nThus it is said:\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the *Xuàn Dàn*.\n\nThe Dao generates Heaven and Earth from this—\nthus it is called the *Xuàn Dàn’s* gate,\nthe root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf one says it does not exist,\nit is endless yet never ceases.\nIf one says it exists,\nhow could one see its presence?\n\nIf it exists yet is not seen,\nif it does not exist yet is not absent—\nthen my use and preservation of it\nneed no deliberation—\nit is simply gathered, with no effort.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven Long, Earth Enduring**\n\nHeaven is long, Earth enduring.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure long because\nthey do not generate themselves—\nthus they can generate eternally.\n\nTherefore, the Sage places his body last,\nyet his body is first;\nsets his body aside,\nyet his body is preserved.\n\nIs it not because he has no selfishness?\nThus he fulfills his selfishness.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nLength and shortness are form;\nduration and nearness are time.\nHeaven moves with time,\nyet fears its form is insufficient—\nthus it is called \"long.\"\nEarth moves with form,\nyet fears its time is insufficient—\nthus it is called \"enduring.\"\n\nThe root of Heaven and Earth emerges from the *Xuàn Dàn*,\nthe substance of the *Xuàn Dàn* stands upon the undying *Gǔ* Spirit.\nTo not die is to not be born;\nthe unborn can give birth to all things—\nthus the Earth can endure long.\n\nThe Sage does not consider his body a burden.\nWhen forced by necessity, yet none can stop him—\nthus it is said: \"Place his body last, yet his body is first.\"\nEstablished in the *Wu Hé Yǒu* [Non-Existent],\nyet none can harm him—\nthus it is said: \"Set his body aside, yet his body is preserved.\"\n\nThe body is his private concern.\nTo place it last, to set it aside—\nis to be public and without selfishness.\nWithout selfishness,\none can fulfill their selfishness.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good Is Like Water**\n\nThe supreme good is like water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend;\nit dwells where others disdain—\nthus it approaches the Dao.\n\nTo dwell is to choose good ground;\nto be still is to have a deep heart;\nto act is to be benevolent;\nto speak is to be trustworthy;\nto govern is to be orderly;\nto act is to be capable;\nto move is to be timely.\n\nOnly because it does not contend\ndoes it incur no blame.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\nOne *yin* and one *yang*—this is the Dao.\nTo follow it is good.\nTo call it \"following\" is already to depart from the Dao,\nno longer its true body.\n\nThe supreme good is the Dao’s true good—\nnot what the world knows as good.\nThus, it is like water.\n\nFor water benefits all things yet does not contend,\ndwells where others disdain—\nand so the supreme good is likewise.\nThough not perfect,\nit nearly approaches the Dao.\n\nThe rivers and seas reign over all valleys\nbecause they are low—\nthus, to dwell is to choose good ground.\nThe stillness of a pool is deep,\nthe stillness of flowing water is deep—\nthus, to be still is to have a deep heart.",

When it is bound to the five flavors, it loses its true nature as a mouth and becomes no different from dullness.\n\nWhen nothing in the ten thousand things can perturb it, the mind remains still and attains sageliness. To chase after externals is to lose all thought and fall into madness—this applies to all things, but hunting and chasing are especially so. Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace; knowing when to stop brings no peril. To act in accordance with this is to preserve oneself. To seek beyond is to invite disgrace and peril, to obstruct one’s path—this applies to all things, but rare treasures are especially so.\n\nThe belly knows nothing, the eyes see much—thus the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes. Therefore, he discards the pursuit of what is seen and desired, and takes instead the emptiness and stillness of what knows nothing and desires nothing.\n\nHonor and humiliation are like sudden shocks;\ngreat calamity is like a threat to one’s body.\n\nWhat is meant by \"honor and humiliation as sudden shocks\"?\nHonor is a lower path—when one obtains it, it is like a shock; when one loses it, it is like a shock. This is called \"honor and humiliation as sudden shocks.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"valuing great calamity as one’s body\"?\nThe reason I have great calamity is that I have a body.\nWhen I have no body, what calamity can I have?\nThus, to value the body as the world is as if one could entrust the world to it;\nto love the body as the world is as if one could commit the world to it.\n\nIt is said: Honor is what is kept by others—it is the lower path. If one clings to one’s honor, then humiliation follows. The reason I have humiliation is that I have shock—before obtaining it, I am shocked by obtaining it; after obtaining it, I am shocked by losing it. If I had no shock, what humiliation could I have? Thus, the humiliation that comes with honor is no more than this.\n\nNobility is what keeps others—it is the higher path. If one clings to one’s nobility, then great calamity follows. The reason I have great calamity is that I have a body, so both joy and misfortune rest upon me. If I had no body, what joy could I have? Thus, the great calamity that comes with nobility is no more than this.\n\nTo speak of the body is to know shock as the mind;\nto speak of shock is to know the body as a burden.\nWithout mind, there is no shock;\nwithout shock, there is no humiliation;\nwithout body, there is no burden;\nwithout burden, there is no calamity.\n\nIn ancient times, Shun, as a commoner, befriended the Son of Heaven—this was indeed honor. Yet if he had clung to it, what humiliation could there be? The vastness of ruling the world was indeed nobility, yet if he had not taken ownership of it, what great joy could there be?\n\nThus, to value the body as the world is as if one could entrust the world to it.\nIf one invites humiliation through honor, then one degrades one’s body—this is not one who can entrust the world to it.\nTo love the body as the world is as if one could commit the world to it.\nIf one incurs calamity through nobility, then one endangers one’s body—this is not one who can commit the world to it.\n\nOnly he who does not cling to his honor or his nobility—like Shun—is truly one who can entrust and commit the world to him.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: \"The Chapter on the Unseen\"**\nThat which is unseen when viewed is called *yí* (uniform);\nthat which is unheard when listened to is called *xī* (rare);\nthat which cannot be grasped is called *wēi* (subtle).\n\nThese three cannot be forced or questioned,\nso they merge into one.\n\nIts upper aspect is not bright,\nits lower aspect is not dark.\n\nIt is boundless yet cannot be named—\nit returns to nothingness.\n\nThis is called the form of formlessness,\nthe image of no-thing—\nthis is called *hūhuǎng* (dim and vague).\n\nApproach it and you see no head;\nfollow it and you see no tail.\n\nHold fast to the ancient Dao\nto govern the present.\n\nTo know the ancient beginning is to hold the thread of the Way.\n\nIt is said: Vision is non-being, so it is unseen.\nThough unseen, it can manifest as dark or yellow—\nit cannot be named as having no color,\nso it is called *yí* alone.\n\nHearing is non-being, so it is unheard.\nThough unheard, it can manifest as *gōng* or *shāng*—\nit cannot be named as having no sound,\nso it is called *xī* alone.\n\nGrasp is non-being, so it cannot be grasped.\nThough not grasped, it can manifest as yin or yang,\nas soft or hard,\nas short or long,\nas round or square,\nas life or death,\nas heat or cold,\nas floating or sinking,\nas emerging or vanishing,\nas sweet or bitter,\nas rank or fragrant—\nit cannot be named as having no form,\nso it is called *wēi* alone.\n\nSome things may be sought and obtained through force,\nbut these three cannot be forced.\nIf they cannot be forced,\nthen one’s ears and eyes are confused,\none’s form and wisdom depart,\nand yet I attain them—\nthen vision, hearing, and grasp merge into one.\n\nVision is through the eyes,\nhearing is through the ears,\ngrasp is through the mind.\nWhen they merge into one,\nthe ears become like eyes,\nthe eyes become like ears,\nthe mind becomes like eyes and ears.\n\nThose who lose the Way see light above and mud below—\nI have attained it, yet its upper aspect is not light,\nso it is not bright;\nits lower aspect is not mud,\nso it is not dark.\n\nBoundless yet true and trustworthy,\nthough it can be trusted,\nit cannot be named—\nthus it returns to nothingness alone.\n\nThough it is nothingness,\nit is called the form of formlessness,\nthe image of no-thing—\nyet it is never truly nothingness.\n\nThis is called *hūhuǎng*—\nnot bright, so it seems to doubt nothingness,\nyet it is not nothingness;\ndim, so it seems to doubt somethingness,\nyet it is not somethingness.",

the Dao dwell among them.\nThose who boast and vaunt themselves\nare what common people detest and contend against—\nthus they are not dwelled among.\n\nSo whether dwelling or not dwelling,\ntheir essence is the same: non-contention.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Indistinctly Formed Thing**\n\nThere is a thing indistinctly formed,\nborn before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent and boundless,\nit stands alone yet does not change,\ncirculates endlessly yet does not weary—\nit may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.\n\nI do not know its name,\nso I call it the Dao.\nForcing a name upon it, I call it Great.\n\nGreat means passing,\npassing means distant,\ndistant means returning.\nThus the Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nand the Sage-King is also Great.\n\nWithin the Four Seas, there are four Greats,\nand the Sage-King occupies one of them.\n\nHumans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nand the Dao follows the Natural Way.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThere is *qi*, there is form, there is substance—\nthus the positions of Heaven, Earth, and humans\nmay be heard, seen, and grasped,\nand the ears, eyes, and mind distinguish these things—\nyet *qi*, form, and substance have not yet been seen.\n*Qi*, form, and substance are indistinctly mingled and not yet separated,\nso when viewed, they are invisible;\nwhen listened to, they are inaudible;\nwhen grasped, they cannot be held—\nthus their form cannot be seen.\nI do not know its name,\nso I name it according to its meaning—\nthus I call it the Dao.\n\nNot knowing its name, I grasp it with the mind.\nI name it the Dao, speaking of it by its meaning.\n\nThe Dao as a thing—\nwhen used, it fills the six voids,\nbut when abandoned, its whereabouts are unknown—\nhow could \"Great\" suffice to name it?\nIt is merely a forced name.\n\nGreat means it circulates universally without exclusion,\nnot confined to my body alone—\nthus Great is called Passing.\nPassing means it moves far without resistance—\nthus Passing is called Distant.\nDistant without resistance means\nseeking its boundary yields nothing—\nreturning to its root, it never truly leaves my body—\nthus Distant is called Returning.\n\nThe Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nand the Sage-King is also Great—\noutside the Four Seas, \"Great\" is insufficient to describe it.\nThe so-called four Greats exist within the realm.\n\nThe Sage-King is the fulfillment of human Dao.\nKnowing constancy, he embraces it,\nand embracing it, he becomes public—\npublic, he becomes the Sage-King—\nthus within the realm, there are four Greats,\nand the Sage-King occupies one.\n\nThe Sage-King is the consummate expression of human Dao.\n\nHumans, with their form, align with the formless—\nEarth does the same—\nthus where Earth reaches, humans also reach—\nhence, \"Humans follow Earth.\"\nWhere Heaven reaches, Earth also reaches—\nhence, \"Earth follows Heaven.\"\nWhere the Dao reaches, Heaven also reaches—\nhence, \"Heaven follows the Dao.\"\nThe Dao is self-rooted, self-originating,\nexisting before Heaven and Earth,\neternally present since antiquity,\nand takes the Natural Way as its law.\nThe Natural Way is lawlessness—\nthus, \"The Dao follows the Natural Way.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as Light Root, the Still as Restless Sovereign**\n\nThe heavy is the root of the light,\nthe still is the sovereign of the restless.\nThus the virtuous person, though traveling all day,\nnever departs from his baggage.\nThough adorned with splendor,\nhis repose is serene and detached.\n\nHow can one who rules a thousand chariots\nlighten himself against the world?\nLightness leads to losing ministers,\nrestlessness leads to losing sovereignty.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe light is first to be moved,\nthe heavy is last to respond—\nresponse arises from being moved—\nthus the heavy is the root of the light.\nThe still commands things,\nthe restless is commanded by things—\nrestlessness is always the servant of stillness—\nthus stillness is the sovereign of the restless.\n\nTherefore, even within a day’s journey,\nthe virtuous person’s actions are measured and restrained—\nyet still, he does not depart from his baggage,\nfor lightness cannot exist without weight.\nThough adorned with splendor may suffice for comfort,\nthere is also serene repose—\nthus restlessness cannot exist without stillness.\n\nIf even daily travel and splendor require this,\nhow much more so for the ruler of a thousand chariots,\nbearing heavy burdens and distant paths,\nobserving all under Heaven—\nhow could he not be still and heavy?\n\nForced into motion, responding only when moved,\nacting only when unavoidable—\nthis is heaviness.\nDoing nothing—\nthis is stillness.\n\nIf his actions are always within his own power,\nyet he cannot refrain from doing—\nthen he lightens himself against the world without weight,\nand without weight, he is restless and not still.\n\nThus it is said:\nAbove, there is non-action,\nbelow, there is also non-action—\nthis makes below and above share the same virtue,\nand below and above sharing virtue means no submission.\nBelow has action,\nabove also has action—\nthis makes above and below share the same Dao,\nand above and below sharing the Dao means no sovereignty.\n\nFor the light takes on the labor of ministers and substitutes for them—\nif ministers do nothing and share the Dao with above,\nthey are not ministers—\nnot ministers means losing ministers.\n\nThe restless forgets the ruler’s ease and serves the world—\nif the ruler also acts, and above and below share the Dao,\nhe is not sovereign—\nnot sovereign means losing sovereignty.\n\nThus it is said:\nLightness leads to losing ministers,\nrestlessness leads to losing sovereignty.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Good Way**\n\nThe good way leaves no tracks,\ngood speech leaves no flaws,\ngood calculation does not use reckoning,\ngood closure requires no locks yet cannot be opened,\ngood binding requires no cords yet cannot be undone.\n\nThus the Sage always rescues people,\nso there are none abandoned;\nalways rescues things,\nso there are none discarded—\nthis is called following clarity.\n\nThus the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous,\nthe unvirtuous are the resources of the good.\nNot valuing

flaws.\n\nKnowing how speech speaks,\nSpeech arises from non-speech,\nHence it is said: *Good speech leaves no flaws.*\n\nOne and speech make two,\nTwo and one make three—\nFrom this onward, even clever reckoning cannot tally,\nOnly he who attains unity and forgets speech\nCan truly bring numbers to completion.\n\nWhen numbers are complete,\nTheir calculation cannot be exhausted,\nHence it is

closure requires no locks yet cannot be opened.*\n\nThe world has its natural order—\nIt is bound not by cords or ropes,\nBut by following its natural state,\nHence it is said: *Good binding requires no cords yet cannot be undone.*\n\nThus, if movement does not follow this,\nMovement cannot lack traces;\nIf speech does not follow this,\nSpeech cannot lack flaws;\nIf calculation, closure, or

where all share it—\nThough movement, speech, calculation, closure, and binding occur,\nNone know how it is done,\nFor his clarity is subtle and unseen,\nHence it is called *following clarity.*\n\nOnly because he excels in rescue\nIs the good person the teacher of the unvirtuous,\nAnd the unvirtuous the resources of the good.\nHow could one abandon what is unvirtuous?\nYet still—\nThose who seek the Dao forget the mind,\nThough the good person is the teacher of the unvirtuous,\nI do not value my teacher,\nThough the unvirtuous are the resources of the good,\nI do not

strength and weakness,\nHave elevation and collapse—\nThe natural course of affairs cannot be otherwise.\nHow then can one force and grasp them?\n\nTherefore the Sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids excessiveness,\nSimply aiding the natural unfolding of all things—\nHow dare they interfere?\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao/Way**\nTo assist the sovereign with the Dao/Way\nIs not to use force to dominate the world—\nTheir affairs return like a boomerang.\n\nWhere the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great campaigns, there are years of famine.\nThus the virtuous act decisively yet do not boast,\nDo not vaunt their achievements,\nDo not grow arrogant,\nAct only when unavoidable,\nAnd do not seek force.\n\nThings grow strong then age—\nThis is called not the Dao.\nNot the Dao, it perishes early.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe sovereign is one of non-action.\nThe assistant is one of action.\nTo take the world cannot be without consequence,\nYet if one acts without restraint,\nTheir ruin comes from using force—\nThough the assistant acts, if not in accord with the Dao,\nHow much more so the sovereign’s non-action?\n\nThis is why their affairs return like a boomerang.\nIf one subdues the world with the Dao,\nThe world dare not refuse.\nBut if one subdues the world with force,\nThey will resist and oppose you.\n\nWhat you send out returns to you.\nWhere the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great campaigns, there are years of famine.\nThe army’s harm to the world is thus—\nThus the skilled warrior acts decisively yet does no more.\n\nDecisive means conquering the enemy.\nTo conquer the enemy—\nWhen the enemy’s attack is like a wailing wind,\nWhen their defense is like a towering rampart—\nThis is decisive.\n\nActing only when unavoidable,\nNot relying on force to dominate.\nDecisive yet not proud of ability,\nDecisive yet not boasting of victory,\nDecisive yet not arrogant in power—\nTheir decisiveness always arises from necessity—\nThis is the way of decisiveness without force.\n\nIf one is decisive yet proud of ability,\nDecisive yet boasts of victory,\nDecisive yet arrogant in power—\nThen this is decisiveness in force,\nNot decisiveness from necessity.\n\nAll things grow young then strong,\nStrong then age—\nThis is their nature.\nThe Dao values guarding softness as strength,\nThus it endures without peril.\n\nIf one uses force to dominate the world,\nThis is to abandon softness and employ strength—\nStrength must age,\nThen it is merely a thing—\nHow can this be the Dao’s way of transforming things?\n\nHence it is said:\nThings grow strong then age—\nThis is called not the Dao.\nNot the Dao, it perishes early.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: On Fine Arms**\nFine arms are an inauspicious instrument,\nThings detest and abhor them—\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\n\nThe gentleman at home values the left,\nIn war values the right.\n\nArms are an inauspicious instrument,\nNot the instrument of the gentleman—\nUsed only when unavoidable,\nWith calmness as the highest virtue.\n\nTo win yet not rejoice in it,\nYet to rejoice is to delight in killing.\n\nThose who delight in killing\nCannot achieve their desires in the world.\n\nAuspicious matters favor the left,\nInauspicious matters favor the right.\nThe left general commands the left,\nThe right general commands the right—\nSpeaking of treating war as a funeral rite.\n\nWhen many are killed, mourn with sorrowful weeping.\nWhen victorious, treat it as a funeral rite.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe cultured observe and the martial conceal—\nThis is the way of Heaven and Earth,\nThe principle of yin and yang.\n\nTo praise arms is to dwell upon the inauspicious,\nTo dwell upon what things abhor—\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\n\nTherefore the gentleman at home values the left,\nIn war values the right—\nTheir priorities differ from ordinary times,\nFor they dwell upon an inauspicious instrument,\nNot the instrument of the gentleman.",

Serenity and simplicity are supreme, hence victory is not glorified.\n\nIt is not that one delights in it—Heaven will save it, shielding it with benevolence. Benevolence is what Heaven delights to promote without wearying of. Then, those who kill—how could they not delight in it? Yet to glorify it is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their desires in the world.\n\nThus auspicious matters favor the left,\nInauspicious matters favor the right.\nThe left general commands the left,\nThe right general commands the right—\nSpeaking of treating war as a funeral rite.\nWhen many are killed, mourn with sorrowful weeping.\nWhen victorious, treat it as a funeral rite.\n\nIf war is treated

strength, overcoming oneself is power—\nOnly by overcoming oneself can one overcome others,\nThus power is the source of strength.\nReturning to the constant is called \"command,\"\nAnd knowing the constant is called \"clarity.\"\nUnable to know oneself, one cannot know the constant—\nThus knowing the constant is the way to know oneself.\nWhen clarity reaches self-knowledge,\nWhat more is there to knowing others?\n\nGuarding softness is strength—\nEngaging others in contention, daily battling with the heart,\nThis is not how to guard softness.\nThus guarding softness is the way to overcome oneself.\nWhen power reaches overcoming oneself,\nWhat more is there to the Sage?\n\nWith self-knowledge’s clarity,\nOne knows all things are complete within oneself,\nRequiring no external emulation—\nThus it is said: Contentment brings wealth.\nWith overcoming oneself’s power,\nOne only strives diligently in the Dao,\nSeeking nothing from others—\nThus it is said: Persistent action fulfills ambition.\nKnowing sufficiency within oneself and striving persistently,\nOne can preserve what must be preserved,\nAnd not be swayed by external things—\nThus it is said: Not losing what one holds ensures longevity.\nPreserving what must be preserved,\nEven in death, one does not perish—\nThus it is said: Dying without perishing ensures true life.\n\n**Chapter 34: The Great Dao

lords and kings remain steadfast for all under heaven without ruin?\n\nThus, the solitary, the orphaned, the childless—\nThough detested and held in contempt by people,\nThose who claim nobility and height do so\nBecause their foundation lies here.\n\nTherefore, when one attains the utmost and exhausts it,\nReaching the One,\nThen nobility does not differ from lowliness,\nAnd lowliness does not depart from height—\nAnd praise arises from the absence of praise.\n\nWhen praise lacks distinction, then slander lacks distinction.\nWhen praise lacks distinction, it cannot be attained as

*Wu*.\nOnly *You* can give birth to all things under heaven,\nAnd *Wu* can give birth to all *You*—\nTherefore, the movement of Dao lies in reversal,\nAnd its use lies in weakness—this is now

and diligently practices it;\nThe middle man hears the Dao and holds it as if it were there, as if it were not;\nThe inferior man hears the Dao and laughs greatly—\nFor if he did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.\n\nThe ancient sayings state:\n*\"The bright Dao seems obscure,\nAdvancing in the Dao seems like retreating,\nLeveling in the Dao seems like disorder,\nThe highest virtue seems like a

it,\nThus, he laughs greatly.\nHe laughs greatly because he seeks it with his emotions and finds nothing.\nIf the Dao could be sought with emotions, he would not laugh—\nThus, it is said: *\"If he

of the world—\nIs this not like a stain?\n\nThe broadest virtue encompasses all without limit—\nYet it never boasts, never asserts itself—\nIs this not like insufficiency?\n\nThe one who well establishes virtue does not uproot—\nYet establishes it with the constant *Wu* (non-being),\nNot with fixed certainty—\nThus, it is said: *\"Establishing virtue seems like theft.\"*\n\nEmbodying

it level seems like disorder,\nCalling it advancing seems like retreating—\nDown to the sound being faint, the form being shapeless—\nName and reality are ever as opposites,\nThus, the Dao is hidden in the nameless,\nAnd when named, it is ever as opposites.\n\nOnly the Dao can be thus—\nTherefore, it is good at lending and completing.\nIt gives to others, yet the more it gives, the more it possesses;\nIt nurtures and rears, lengthens and matures, completes and ripens, nourishes and shelters—\nAll this is the Dao.\nThus, it is said: *\"Only the Dao is good at lending and

*Three gives birth to the myriad things.*\n\nThe hidden and unfathomable—\nThis is yin.\nThe bright and visible—\nThis is yang.\nAll that is born\nTurns its back to the hidden, unfathomable yin,\nAnd faces the bright, visible yang—\nThus, it is said: *The myriad things bear yin upon their backs and embrace yang within.*\nTo bear is to turn away,\nTo embrace is to face.\n\nYet, it must be the interplay of *chong* and *qi* to bring harmony.\nFor yin and yang are Two,\nAnd *chong* and *qi* are One—\nWithout this One, nothing could be born.\nThus, what people desire—\nAre carriages, caps, wealth, and nobility—\nYet what they detest—\nAre solitude, childlessness, and barrenness.\nWhen carriages and caps adorn the body,\nThey are not one’s nature and life,\nBut things that come and go like transient guests—\nYet if one clings to them as if they were permanent,\nThen one clings to yang and forgets to return to yin,\nThe most extreme case.\n\nThe ancients established names,\nUsing what people detest as the titles of kings and lords,\nSo that the noble would not forget the lowly,\nThe high would not forget the low,\nThat one would know what to bear and what to embrace,\nWhat to face and what to return to—\nAll to avoid losing the harmony of *chong* and One.\n\nThus, things sometimes benefit by loss,\nAnd are harmed by gain.\nFullness invites ruin,\nHumility invites increase—\nThis is the Way of Heaven.\n\nWhat people teach,\nIs also what I teach as *yi*.\nWhat I teach is the Dao—\nTo teach without *yi* is not the Dao.\n\nOnly those who align with the Dao attain One,\nAttain One, and there is no self.\nNo self, no striving.\nOnly those who do not strive\nCannot be contended with by the world—\nThe opposite leads only to death.\n\nThe noble’s teaching of others,\nThough sometimes differing,\nYet all return to One and no self—\nThis is where teaching originates.\nThus, it is said: *The strong and violent shall not meet their end.*\nI shall take this as my teacher.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The Supreme Softness in the World**\n\nThe supreme softness in the world\nDrives and conquers the supreme firmness in the world.\nThere is nothing that cannot enter where there is no gap—\nThus, I know the benefits of *wuwei*.\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid,\nThe benefits of *wuwei*—\nFew in the world can attain them.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe supreme softness in the world\nDrives and conquers the supreme firmness in the world—\nObserving things, water is such.\nThere is nothing that cannot enter where there is no gap—\nObserving things, *qi* is such.\n\nWater, through its softness and weakness,\nApproaches the Dao,\nYet it cannot be without form—\nStill, it can attack the firm and strong,\nAnd none can surpass it.\n\n*Qi*, through its lack of substance,\nAligns with the spirit,\nYet it cannot be without *qi*—\nStill, it can enter where there is no gap.\nHow much more so the supreme softness,\nThe *Taiyi* before *qi* took form—\nWith this, it drives and conquers the supreme firmness,\nAnd enters where there is no gap—\nWho would not be moved?\nAnd who would not find their own way?\n\nThus, it is said: *I know the benefits of wuwei.*\nYet the teaching of the unsaid,\nThe benefits of *wuwei*—\nFew in the world can attain them,\nFor they do not know how to return to their origin.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: The Great Fullness as if Deficient**\n\nThe great fullness seems as if deficient,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nThe great excess seems as if empty,\nYet its use is unending.\nThe greatest straightness seems as if bent,\nThe greatest skill seems as if clumsy,\nThe greatest eloquence seems as if tongue-tied.\n\nThe restless overcomes cold,\nThe tranquil overcomes heat,\nThe clear and tranquil are the rectification of the world.\n\nThe Classic says:\nAll things begin here and end here—\nThis is the great fullness.\nYet it begins with no beginning,\nEnds with no end,\nThus, it seems as if

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Forty-Six: The Great Fullness as if Deficient (Continued)**\n\nIt is because of its apparent deficiency that its use renews daily without exhaustion.\nAll things draw from it yet are never depleted—this is the great fullness.\nYet when added to, it does not grow more abundant, hence its emptiness.\nIt is because of its emptiness that its use is ever-sufficient without end.\n\nThe greatest straightness bends to preserve itself,\nAnd what is bent is made straight—\nThus, it seems as if crooked.\nThe greatest skill carves myriad forms yet does not flaunt its art—\nThus, it seems as if clumsy.\nThe greatest eloquence speaks without words—\nThus, it seems as if tongue-tied.\nSo it is—no other reason—\nFor all things have their root.\n\nWhat is this root?\nNow, cold and heat are what Heaven and Earth produce,\nWhat all things cannot escape,\nYet a single surge of agitation can overcome cold,\nAnd a single moment of stillness can overcome heat.\nIf such fleeting agitation and tranquility\nCan prevail over Heaven and Earth’s workings,\nThen how much more so\nThe body’s natural stillness and clarity,\nWhich rectify the world—\nWhere would it not triumph?\n\nThus, when speaking of its completion,\nIt seems deficient yet never exhausted;\nWhen speaking of its fullness,\nIt seems empty yet never depleted.\nIts straightness bends yet extends,\nIts skill seems clumsy yet is refined,\nIts eloquence seems stammering yet is clear—\nThis is called having root.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: The World in Harmony**\n\nWhen the Way prevails in the world,\nWarhorses are driven back to manure.\nWhen the Way is lost in the world,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo crime is greater than desiring what is desirable,\nNo calamity greater than not knowing sufficiency,\nNo fault greater than seeking to obtain.\nThus, he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\nThe Classic says:\nWhen the Way prevails in the world,\nThe people’s wisdom and skill are confined to tilling and eating,\nWhile theft and strife vanish in the absence of desire—\nAnd their deaths are as natural as shedding old skin.\nThus, it is said: *\"Warhorses are driven back to manure.\"*\n\nWhen the Way is lost in the world,\nDesire for what is desirable becomes the root of warfare,\nAnd even borders cannot secure peace—\nThus, it is said: *\"Warhorses breed in the suburbs.\"*\n\nThen whence do crimes arise?\nFrom desiring what is desirable—\nHence, *\"No crime is greater than desiring what is desirable.\"*\n\nBecause of desiring what is desirable,\nOne does not know sufficiency,\nAnd though there is abundance, one does not cease—\nModeration brings blessing, excess brings ruin.\nHence, *\"No calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency.\"*\n\nBecause of not knowing sufficiency,\nOne seeks to obtain,\nAnd when desire is fulfilled,\nResentment and blame are invited,\nAnd war never ends—\nHence, *\"No fault is greater than seeking to obtain.\"*\n\nThus, the one who does not know sufficiency,\nThough abundant, is never satisfied—\nBut he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven: The Unseen Knowing**\n\nWithout stepping outside,\nOne knows the world;\nWithout peering through windows,\nOne sees the Way of Heaven.\n\nThe farther one goes,\nThe less one knows.\nThus, the Sage acts without moving yet knows,\nSees without looking yet names,\nAccomplishes without doing.\n\nThe Classic says:\nWhat is it that makes the world the world?\nTo know how the world becomes the world,\nOne need not step outside to know it.\nWhat is it that makes the Way of Heaven the Way of Heaven?\nTo see how the Way of Heaven becomes the Way of Heaven,\nOne need not peer through windows to see it.\n\nNow, the world is vast and boundless—\nIf one waits to go out before knowing it,\nHow few will be the places one’s strength can reach,\nAnd how little will one truly know?\nThe Way of Heaven is distant and unfathomable—\nIf one waits to peer before seeing it,\nHow few will be the sights one’s eyes can grasp,\nAnd how little will one truly see?\n\nThus, it is said:\n*The farther one goes, the less one knows.*\n\nTherefore, the Sage knows how the world becomes the world,\nAnd so acts without moving yet knows;\nSees how the Way of Heaven becomes the Way of Heaven,\nAnd so names without looking.\nWhy?\nBecause it is already complete within.\n\nTo know what cannot be traveled,\nTo name what cannot be seen,\nIs to accomplish without doing.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight: The Learning of the Way**\n\nLearning increases daily,\nThe Way decreases daily.\nDecrease it again and again,\nUntil one reaches *wuwei*—\nAnd in *wuwei*, nothing remains undone.\n\nThus, to take the world is always through non-action,\nYet when action arises,\nIt is insufficient to take the world.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe learner has not yet heard the Way,\nAnd in seeking it, cannot avoid striving—\nHence, *\"increase.\"*\nThe one who practices the Way has already heard it,\nAnd in practicing, aims only at *wuwei*—\nHence, *\"decrease.\"*\n\nYet even in decreasing, one is not free of action,\nSo decrease the very act of decreasing,\nAnd only then does one reach *wuwei*.\n*Wuwei* is simply being without contrivance.\nTo do without doing is to transcend all lack—\nThis is called *\"abandoning learning, free of care.\"*\n\nFree of care is called *shen*—\n*Shen* is that which nurtures all things yet is not a thing—\nThen what need has it of the world?\nFrom this perspective,\nTo take the world is always through non-action,\nYet when action arises,\nIt is insufficient to take the world.\n\nObserve how Zhuang Zhou responded to emperors and kings,\nAnd through deep inquiry, this may be understood.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage’s Heart**\n\nThe Sage has no fixed heart,\nTaking the hearts of the people as his own.\nThe good, I treat as good;\nThe ungood, I also treat as good—\nThus, virtue is good.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nThus, virtue is trust.\n\nThe Sage in the world\nMurmurs softly, blending the hearts of the people.\nAll the people turn their ears and eyes toward him,\nAnd the Sage treats them as children.\n\nThe Classic says:\nIs the human heart so divine?\nHold it, and it exists;\nRelease it, and it vanishes.\nIt enters and exits without measure,\nAnd none can trace its path.\nTo hold it is to preserve it,\nTo release it is to lose it—\nThus, it has no fixed form to measure.\nIt enters and exits without time,\nAnd cannot be sought in past or future—\nThus, it cannot be confined to a place.\nIf the heart is so,\nThen the human heart is likewise.",

honor the Dao and hold virtue dear.\n\nThe Dao’s honor, virtue’s nobility—\nNone bestow them, yet they abide naturally.\n\nThus the Dao gives birth, nurtures, rears, completes, matures, and shelters.\nIt gives birth yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely,\nNurtures yet does not dominate—\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nThe Classic says:\nAll things’ birth stems from the Nameless,\nYet their nurturing abides in the One, still unformed,\nAt the moment when things gain life.\nThe Nameless is the Dao.\nThe One, still unformed, yet giving life—this is virtue.\n\nWhen they become things, they are merely shaped,\nNot the source of their birth and nurturing.\nOnce formed, the naked must remain naked,\nThe scaly, the shelled, the feathered, the furred—\nEach must be scaly, shelled, feathered, or furred,\nAnd from youth to old age and death—\nAll this is the inevitable unfolding of circumstances.\nThus it is said:\n*The Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures, things shape, circumstances complete.*\n\nYet circumstances arise from form,\nForm from virtue,\nVirtue from the Dao.\nThe Dao and virtue are the root;\nForm and circumstances are the branches.\nThe root is honored, the branches lowly;\nThe root is noble, the branches base—\nThus all things do not fail to honor the Dao and hold virtue dear.\n\nThe Dao’s honor, virtue’s nobility—\nNone bestow them, yet they abide naturally.\nThis is how the uncarved block’s softness and weakness\nCan overcome the rigidity and strength of form and circumstances—\nThus kings and lords transform the world\nNot through this, but through that.\n\nThough it is said:\n*The Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures, things shape, circumstances complete,*\nWhen speaking of the root,\nTo give birth, to nurture, to rear, to complete, to mature, to shelter—\nAll are the Dao.\nYet the Dao remains nameless,\nThus it is said:\n*It gives birth yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely,\nNurtures yet does not dominate—\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: \"The Origin of the World\"**\n\nThe world has its origin,\nWhich becomes the world’s mother.\nHaving obtained its mother,\nOne knows its children;\nHaving known its children,\nOne returns to guard its mother—\nAnd thus the body perishes not.\n\nClose the senses’ openings,\nShut the gates—\nAnd one’s life is never weary.\nOpen the senses’ openings,\nPursue affairs—\nAnd one’s life is never saved.\n\nTo see what is small is called clarity;\nTo hold fast to softness is called strength.\nUsing its radiance,\nThen returning to its clarity—\nNo calamity befalls the body—\nThis is called *Clinging to the Constant.*\n\nThe Classic says:\n*The world has its origin, which becomes the world’s mother—*\nThis is what the Classic calls *\"The Dao, whose name I do not know.\"*\n\nThe Nameless is the origin of heaven and earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nYet the Dao, though nameless, is the world’s mother—\nWhy?\nBecause the Named is merely the mother of all things,\nBut not the mother of the world.\nThe Nameless is the origin of heaven and earth,\nAnd all beneath heaven spring from it—\nThus it is said:\n*The world has its origin, which becomes the world’s mother.*\n\nTo hear the Dao is easy;\nTo obtain the Dao is difficult.\nTo obtain the Dao is easy;\nTo guard the Dao is difficult.\n\nNow that I have obtained its mother\nAnd aligned it with my heart—\nNot merely heard—\nI know all things beneath heaven are my own emergence.\nKnowing all things beneath heaven are my own emergence,\nAnd yet I guard it without loss—\nWho beneath heaven could harm what emerges from itself?\nThis is how one serves the body without peril.\n\nClose the senses’ openings,\nShut the gates—\nAnd one’s life is never weary—\nThis is guarding its mother.\nWhen the heart stirs within and I indulge it—\nThis is called *having openings.*\nWith openings, the heart departs and engages things;\nI close the openings and do not pass through—\nNot passing through, the heart does not depart.\nWhen things draw me outward and I receive them—\nThis is called *having gates.*\nWith gates, things enter and disturb the heart;\nI shut the gates and do not receive—\nNot receiving, things do not enter.\nWithin, nothing departs;\nWithout, nothing enters—\nThough myriad transformations teem before me,\nEach returns to its root, unknown—\nWhat weariness is there?\n\nThe ancients could abandon the heart and employ the form—\nThrough this Dao.\n\nIf one opens the openings and does not close them,\nPursues affairs and does not cease—\nThen the heart becomes a mere lodging for things,\nWith nowhere to guard itself—\nWhat reliance could prevent ruin?\nThis is why one’s life is never saved.\n\nOnly those who guard its mother\nPerceive the heart’s stirrings in their subtlest motion\nAnd remain still, unmoved.\nStill and unmoved, yet responsive—\nThus the world’s patterns flow through them—\nHence it is said:\n*To see what is small is called clarity.*\nTo hold fast to the formless ultimate softness—\nNo thing can overcome it—\nHence it is said:\n*To hold fast to softness is called strength.*\nHaving used its radiance to illuminate its stirrings,\nThen returning to its clarity to revert to stillness—\nNever opening the openings, never pursuing affairs—\nHow could calamity befall?\nThus one clings to the harmony of knowing,\nDeep yet unseen—\nHence it is said:\n*Using its radiance, returning to its clarity—\nNo calamity befalls the body—\nThis is called Clinging to the Constant.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: \"If I Were to Be Rigid\"**\n\nIf I were rigidly knowing,\nWalking the Great Dao,\nI would fear only *action.*\n\nThe Great Dao is most level,\nYet people love shortcuts.\nMorning halls are swept clean,\nFields grow overgrown,\nGranaries lie empty—\nFine silks adorn the body,\nSharp swords gird the waist,\nFeasts glut the palate,\nWealth overflows—\nThis is called *robber’s splendor,*\nNot the Dao.\n\nThe Classic says:\nThe gentleman’s approach to the Dao\nCannot be without earnestness.\nThe heart, restrained with no excess,\nThough myriad changes array themselves—\nThey cannot disturb my stillness—\nWhat is there to fear in action?\n\nIf I cannot restrain my heart,\nYet rigidly knowing walk the Great Dao,\nI would fear only *action,*\nSeeking to traverse it safely—\nThis is impossible,\nMuch less for those who open the openings\nAnd pursue affairs.",

suffices, wealth abounds;\nwhen wealth abounds, the court is orderly—\nfor this is how one knows the source of all things.\n\nBut if one pursues the Great Dao with rigid, deliberate knowing,\nthey lose its origin,\nand without the origin, its manifestations are not their own.\nTo take what is not theirs—\nit is like sweeping one’s courtyard clean,\nneglecting the fields,\nemptying the granaries,\nyet adorning oneself in fine silks,\ngirding sharp swords,\nindulging in feasts,\nand hoarding wealth—\nthis is not their own, yet they take it.\nWithout robbery and ostentation, how could it be?\nHow could this be the Dao?\n\n**Chapter 54: The Unshaken Foundation**\nThose who build well do not uproot;\nthose who embrace well do not slip.\nTheir descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.\n\nCultivate within oneself, and virtue becomes true;\ncultivate within the family, and virtue overflows;\ncultivate within the village, and virtue endures;\ncultivate within the state, and virtue flourishes;\ncultivate within the world, and virtue is universal.\nThus, observe the self to understand the self,\nobserve the family to understand the family,\nobserve the village to understand the village,\nobserve the state to understand the state,\nobserve the world to understand the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe Classic says:\nAll things that are

fast\nwill inevitably slip away.\nOnly those who follow the Dao,\nembracing *qi* with stillness,\ngrasp well without losing hold.\n\nIf what is built and embraced is thus,\nthen its transmission knows no end—\nthis is why descendants continue sacrifices without ceasing.\n\nWhat the world calls \"cultivating virtue\"\nsometimes cultivates it in states and nations\nwithout knowing its true origin lies within oneself—\nthus it is said: *Cultivate within the self, and virtue becomes true.*\nOr it is cultivated in the self\nbut cannot extend to states and nations—\nthus it is said: *Cultivate within the family, and virtue overflows,*\n*Cultivate within the village, and virtue endures,*\n*Cultivate within the state, and virtue flourishes,*\n*Cultivate within the world, and virtue is

and cultivate the self?\nBy observing the self with the self alone.\n\nWhat does it mean to observe the self with the self?\nNow, when I observe what my self possesses—\nI know the source from which my self has come.\nAgain, when I observe what allows me to observe—\nI know the source from which my observing arises.\nHaving known the source of my self’s possession,\nand the source of my observing,\nthen what is needed to cultivate the self is complete,\nrequiring no external aid.\n\nTo observe the family with the family,\nthe state with the state,\nthe world with the world—\nit is

to know clarity;\nto increase life is to bring auspiciousness;\nto let the heart direct *qi* is to strengthen.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they decline—\nthis is called *not the Dao*.\nNot the Dao brings early decay.\n\nThe Classic says:\nWhen humans are first born,\ntheir innate virtue is most profound.\nAs they grow, their ears and eyes turn outward,\ntheir mind and perception turn inward,\nand with each passing day, their excesses multiply—\nthus their depth diminishes.\n\nThose who follow the Dao reduce what brings excess,\nrefining nature to restore virtue,\nuntil virtue returns to its original state—\nhence it is said: *The depth of contained virtue is like that of an infant.*\n\nFor the infant as a being,\nit is merely that it receives the pure *qi* of the cosmos,\nundispersed, yet poisonous insects do not sting,\nferocious beasts do not attack,\ngrasping crows do not peck.\nHow much more so for one who is fully pure and unguarded,\nharmonized with all things in their creation,\nwhose harmony is vast and universal—\nwho could harm them?\n\nThis is what Wei Wenhou asked of Bo Shuang.\n\nIt is only the pure that can achieve harmony—\nhow do I know this?\nNow, the infant grasps firmly without knowing what it grasps,\nrises erect without knowing what it embraces—\nthis is purity.\nIf the infant had deliberate knowledge of grasping and embracing,\nit would be coarse and inconsistent—\nhow could it remain thus?\nThus it is said: *Bones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm;\nthey do not know the union of male and female yet

says:\n*\"The military does not enter the state,\nthe state does not enter the military—\nthis distinction has endured long,\nand thus the methods of governing and waging war differ fundamentally.\"*\n\nTo govern a state,\none must not rely on fleeting or transient measures—\nthus, one governs with rectitude, not with the unconventional.\nRectitude is what endures and persists.\nWarfare is an inauspicious instrument,\nnot the tool of the virtuous—\nthus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it.\nIf warfare persists and endures,\nthen one has indeed dwelled upon it—\nthus, one employs the unconventional, not rectitude.\nThe unconventional is what responds to the exigencies of the moment.\n\nBecause of this, one cannot avoid using rectitude in governance,\nand thus it is said:\n*\"Do not govern with cleverness—\nthis is the blessing of the state.*\nTo govern without relying on cleverness,\nit is clear that one cannot take the world with action.\nThus it is said:\n*'Govern with rectitude,\nemploy the unconventional in warfare,\nand take the world with non-action.'*\n\nHow do I know that non-action suffices to take the world?\nBecause action does not suffice to take the world,\nand thus I know it.\n\nOnly when one departs from non-action\nand arrives at action,\ndoes the world abound in taboos—\nmen avoid what they fear,\nand thus the unemployed multiply while the people grow ever poorer.\nMen multiply clever devices to pursue their desires,\nand thus the lower orders become difficult to govern,\nwhile the state grows ever more confused.\nThe people grow ever poorer and more cunning,\nthe state grows ever more confused and strange things proliferate—\nthis is why laws and decrees proliferate,\nand thieves and robbers abound.\n\nLaws are enforced where they are applied,\nbut cannot be enforced where they are not.\nDecrees are obeyed where they are heard,\nbut cannot be obeyed where they are not.\nWhen the people are poor and cunning,\nthere will be places where decrees are not obeyed.\nWhen the state is confused and strange things proliferate,\nthere will be places where laws are not applied—\nthis is why they proliferate and thieves and robbers abound.\n\nIf this is so,\nthen all the faults of taking the world with action are evident.\nThus the Sage says:\n*\"I act without action, and the people transform themselves.\nI love stillness, and the people align themselves.\nI take no action, and the people grow rich.\nI desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\nThis is the constant proof that the world is taken with non-action.\n\nFor if one acts without action,\nthe people transform themselves,\nand if one loves stillness,\nthe people align themselves—\nthen the people will not multiply cunning,\nstrange things will not proliferate,\nlaws and decrees will not proliferate,\nand thieves and robbers will not abound.\nIf one takes no action,\nthe people grow rich,\nand if one desires nothing,\nthe people return to simplicity—\nthen the world will not abound in taboos,\nand the people will not grow poorer,\nnor will men multiply clever devices\nand the state grow

people multiply cunning,\nstrange things proliferate,\nlaws and decrees proliferate,\nand thieves and robbers abound.\n\nTo reverse this,\none must return to non-action and love stillness—\nthrough non-action, the people transform themselves,\nand abandon cunning, discard profit,\nso that strange things do not arise.\nThrough loving stillness, the people align themselves,\nand thieves and robbers disappear.\nFrom non-action and loving stillness,\none arrives at non-action and no desire.\nThrough non-action, the people grow rich\nand are free from the poverty of taboos.\nThrough no

fish.\nTo rule the world with the Dao,\nits spirits are not numinous.\nNot that its spirits are not numinous—\nbut because they are not numinous, they do not harm the people.\nAnd because they do not harm the people,\nthe Sage does not harm the people.\nThus, when neither harms the other,\nvirtue and power return to each other.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Having obtained the mother of possessing a realm to govern the realm,\neven the greatest task is without difficulty.\"*\n\nOne does not overcook a fish when poaching,\nand when poaching a small fish,\none must preserve it whole, not cutting it.\nSo too with governing a great realm—\nif one cooks and cuts it, harm will come.\nTo rule the world with the Dao is called the Great Measure—\nit is simply to refrain from cutting and harming.\n\nWhen it reaches its utmost,\nits spirits are not numinous—\nthis is simply the result of not harming.\nHow so?\nThe spirits, by the Dao,\nare not without numinosity—\nwhen they mingle and contend with humanity,\ntheir numinosity appears,\nand they cannot but harm people.\nYet why are they not numinous?\nBecause the Sage can rule the world with the Dao,\npreventing people from indulging their nature,\nfrom straying in their virtue,\nfrom extreme joy or anger that disrupts the harmony of yin and yang—\nthose who dwell in the undifferentiated void,\nin harmony with the age, attaining tranquility—\nthus, the Sage does not harm people.\nOnly the Sage can refrain from harming people,\nso yin and yang remain harmonious and still,\nspirits and gods do not disturb,\nall things are unharmed,\nand life does not perish early—\nthus, their numinosity does not harm people.\nWhen their numinosity does not harm people,\nthere is no need for their manifestations to appear as numinous.\nFrom this, it is seen:\nTheir spirits are not numinous,\nnot because their spirits are not numinous—\nbut because their numinosity does not harm people,\nthey are not numinous.\nNot because their numinosity does not harm people—\nbut because the Sage does not harm people,\ntheir numinosity does not harm people.\nIf the Sage, in relation to the people,\ncannot preserve their primal purity and harms them,\nand people lose their nature,\nso that the seasons do not arrive,\nthe balance of cold and heat is not achieved,\nand the ways in which people harm spirits multiply—\nthen how could the spirits not harm people?\nOnly when spirits do not harm people\ndo they return virtue to humanity,\nand when spirits do not harm people,\npeople in turn return virtue to the spirits—\nthus it is said:\n*\"When neither harms the other,\nvirtue and power return to each other.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One: The Great Realm as the Lowly Stream**\n\nThe great realm is the lowly stream of the world,\nthe world’s exchange, the world’s exchange as the receptive.\nThe receptive always overcomes the active through stillness,\nand stillness is the lowly.\nThus, when the great realm yields to the small realm,\nit takes the small realm;\nwhen the small realm yields to the great realm,\nit takes the great realm.\nThus, sometimes yielding to take,\nsometimes yielding and taking.\nThe great realm seeks only to nurture people,\nthe small realm seeks only to serve the great.\nBoth obtain what they desire,\nso the greater should yield.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Knowing how to govern one’s realm with the Dao,\none certainly does not harm its people—\nyet if one does not know how to exchange with the world,\nthen even if one does not harm people,\nthere will still be those who harm them.\"*\n\nThe great realm as the lowly stream,\nthe world’s exchange, the world’s exchange as the receptive—\nthe receptive always overcomes the active through stillness,\nand stillness is the lowly.\nThis is the way to exchange with the world\nand preserve its people.\nIndeed, the world’s exchange is the receptive,\nand the receptive always overcomes the active through stillness—\nand the reason it overcomes is because it yields through stillness.\n\nIf the great realm truly dwells in the lowly stream\nto achieve the world’s exchange,\nthen the receptive’s stillness as the lowly\nis the way to overcome the active—\nthus, when the great yields to the small,\nit takes the small—\nthis is what is meant by *\"yielding to take.\"*\nYielding to take means:\nThough the great, in relation to the small,\nseems as if it could avoid yielding,\nit yields to take in winter.\nWhen the small yields to the great,\nit takes the great—\nthis is what is meant by *\"yielding and taking.\"*\nYielding and taking means:\nThough the small, in relation to the great,\ncannot but yield to take.\nIndeed, the great seeks only to nurture people,\nwhile the small seeks only to serve the great.\nNow, the great yields to the small,\nand the small yields to the great—\nboth obtain what they desire,\nso who would not take?\nTaking means:\nTo win their hearts and not lose them.\n\nThen why does it say only the great should yield?\nBecause if the small cannot yield to the great,\nit not only fails to take the great realm\nbut also invites calamity upon itself—\nthus, it is not merely inappropriate,\nhence it is said: *\"The great should yield.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Innermost Essence of All Things**\n\nThe Dao is the innermost essence of all things,\nthe treasure of the virtuous,\nthe refuge of the unvirtuous.\nBeautiful words can be sold,\nnoble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\nWhat is there to abandon in humanity’s unvirtue?\nThus, when establishing the Son of Heaven\nand appointing the Three Ministers,\neven if one offers a jade tablet before four horses,\nit is not as good as presenting this Dao.\n\nThe ancients valued this Dao so highly—\nwhy not seek it daily to obtain it,\nand use it to avert guilt?\nThus, it is the most precious for the world.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"All things bear yin within and embrace yang without,\nand through the interplay of the void and qi achieve harmony—\nthus, there is not a single thing that is not complete within the Dao.\"*\n\nA house has its innermost chamber,\ndeep and secluded, where the honored dwell.\nAll things have their deep, secluded, and honored places—\nthis is the Dao.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The Dao is the innermost essence of all things.\"*\nBecause of this,\nit is the treasure of the virtuous\nand the refuge of the unvirtuous.\nHow so?\nThe virtuous know where their virtue originates,\nand thus, obtaining it, they possess boundless, inexhaustible wealth—\nis this not their treasure?\nThe unvirtuous, knowing their unvirtue,\nwhen they reach this point of profound unity,\neven with ten thousand evils,\nthey dissolve and release—\nis this not their refuge?",

taste.\nTo savor is to repeatedly examine and ponder it.\nThe Dao, as a thing,\ncannot be seen when looked at,\ncannot be heard when listened to,\ncannot be grasped when seized—\neven when repeatedly examined and pondered,\nit returns to nothingness.\nBecause of this,\nit can be great, can be small,\ncan be much, can be little.\nMuch and little depend on oneself,\nand those called \"resentful\"

all under Heaven and the state\nis without difficulty.\n\nThus, the Sage never strives for greatness,\nand so achieves true greatness—\nfor greatness lies in what is small,\nnot in what is already

when difficult—\nif one does not plan at the beginning when it is easy,\nbut waits until it is difficult,\nthen it becomes difficult—\nthis is why common people are few in trust and often face

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Doctrine of the Gentle Scholar (Continued)**\n\nThe Classics say: *\"The term 'scholar' (士) refers to one who serves the Dao and takes upon himself the responsibility of guiding others.\"* To serve the Dao is to triumph through non-contention; to guide others is to employ the *power of using people*. If this is so, then what need is there for force? Hence it is said: *\"The virtuous scholar does not rely on force.\"* For a scholar who has no need of force, then the one skilled in battle does not grow angry, the one who best defeats enemies does not contend, and the one who best uses people places himself below them—this is only proper.\n\nWhy is this? Those who embody the Dao do not contend; when they do not contend, none under heaven can contend with them. Thus, the virtuous scholar does not rely on force, the skilled warrior does not grow angry, and the one who best defeats enemies does not contend—this is called the *virtue of non-contention*. Those who embody the Dao can place themselves below others; those who place themselves below others take joy in being used and do not seek self-use. Thus, the one who best uses people places himself below them—this is called the *power of using people*.\n\nIn *virtue*, there is no contention; in *power*, one employs others. Even in the dangers of warfare, I remain without action—how much more so in all else? To act without acting is the *virtue of Heaven*; when one reaches the state of non-action, one aligns with Heaven and cannot be surpassed. Hence it is said: *\"This is called the harmony of ancient times with Heaven.\"*\n\n**Chapter Seventy: The Art of Warfare**\n\nThe art of warfare has this saying: *\"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"* This is called *moving without moving*, *pushing without arms*, *conquering without opposition*, *holding without weapons*. No greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy; to underestimate the enemy risks losing my treasures. Hence, when armies clash, the compassionate shall prevail.\n\nThe Classics say: *\"The Dao’s movement always arises from being pressed yet triumphing through non-contention. When applied to warfare, it should seem as though there is no action.\"* Yet those who wage war say: *\"I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender; I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"* Thus, even in war, one moves only when pressed, yet triumphs through non-contention—how much more so in all else?\n\nWhy is this? The aggressor is reversed, the defender prevails; the aggressor labors, the defender rests; advancing is arrogant, retreating is humble; advancing is hasty, retreating is composed. To meet reversal with compliance, to meet labor with rest, to meet arrogance with humility, to meet haste with composure—these are not to be opposed. This is so because the Dao’s constant principle arises from non-action; thus its movement always arises from being pressed, and its victory always comes through non-contention—even in warfare, it is no different.\n\nIf one truly knows that action arises from non-action, then my conduct is always without conduct, my pushing is always without arms, my opposition is always without resistance, my grasp is always without weapons—where then can I not triumph? If one cannot act from non-action, knowing only the aggressor but not the defender, knowing only advance but not retreat, this is called underestimating the enemy. To underestimate the enemy risks losing what I hold dear—my treasures. Hence it is said: *\"No greater calamity exists than underestimating the enemy; to underestimate the enemy risks losing my treasures.\"* Only those who triumph through non-contention cannot be defeated; hence it is said: *\"When armies clash, the compassionate shall prevail.\"*\n\n**Chapter Seventy: The Dao’s Simplicity**\n\nMy words are very easy to know, very easy to act upon.\nYet none under heaven can know them, none can act upon them.\nWords have a root; affairs have a lord.\nIt is only because of ignorance that they do not know me.\nFew know me, and thus I am held in high regard.\nTherefore the Sage appears in humble garb while treasuring virtue.\n\nThe Classics say: *\"The Dao follows natural law; its words are rare yet natural.\"* Naturalness means non-action; thus to know and act upon it is not difficult. Yet none under heaven can know or act—why is this? Because words have a root, and affairs have a lord, yet none under heaven knows their root or lord, and thus they do not know me.\n\nWhat is the root? Non-action yet naturalness—that is the root of words. From this root, though words may differ, they are but branches and descendants—how can there be those who do not know? What is the lord? Non-action yet naturalness—that is the lord of affairs. To grasp the lord and govern it, though affairs may differ, they are but servants—how can there be those who cannot act?\n\nIt is only because they do not know the root and the lord that they do not know me. The Dao’s reason for being held in high regard by all under heaven is that it cannot be known by knowing, cannot be recognized by recognition—thus it is held in high regard. If the Dao could be known by knowing and recognized by recognition, what would be its worth? Hence it is said: *\"Few know me, and thus I am held in high regard.\"* Therefore the Sage appears with the guise of humiliation and folly, yet within holds great virtue and splendor—this is called *\"wearing coarse cloth while treasuring jade.\"*\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**\n\nKnowing the unknown—this is the highest.",

deficient are supplemented.\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,\nBut the Dao of humanity does otherwise—\nIt diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho then can use their excess to nourish the world?\nOnly the one in accord with the Dao.\n\nThus, the Sage acts but does not rely upon it,\nCompletes the deed but does not dwell upon it—\nWhy does he not wish to be seen as virtuous?\nThe Classic says: *The Dao of Heaven is simply non-action.*\nNon-action means no partiality,\nNo partiality means balance—\nJust as with drawing a bow:\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nThe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented,\nAnd all is brought to balance.\n\nNow, the Dao of Heaven does not deliberately lower the high or raise the low;\nIt simply follows non-action, letting things take their natural course.\nThus, the high become excessive and must be diminished,\nThe low become deficient and must be supplemented.\nFullness invites diminishment, humility invites increase—\nThis is the working of Heaven’s Dao.\n\nHumanity cannot practice non-action,\nCannot practice non-action, then cannot avoid partiality,\nCannot avoid partiality, then it comes to diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive—\nWhich is no different.\n\nOnly the one in accord with the Dao\nKnows that before anything arises, all deeds and names are my own excess,\nWhile the world’s deficiencies struggle and contend.\nThus, he diminishes his excess to nourish the world without claiming it,\nAnd it is said: *Only the one in accord with the Dao can diminish his excess to nourish the world.*\nThe Sage is the one in accord with the Dao,\nAnd so he acts but does not rely upon it,\nCompletes the deed but does not dwell upon it—\nNot because he does not wish to be seen as virtuous,\nBut simply because he follows the Dao of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Soft and Weak of the World**\n\nNothing in the world is as soft and weak as water,\nYet nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong.\nHeaven uses this to transform it.\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong—\nAll know this, yet none can practice it.\n\nTherefore, the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the world’s impurities is to be called the master of the state and soil;\nTo bear the world’s misfortunes is to be called the king of the world.\"*\nThis is *straight speech as if reversed.*\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Of all things in the world, only water can\nFollow the contours of the crooked and straight, the round and square—\nThus, nothing is as soft and weak as water.\nYet it flows past great objects,\nTurns great stones,\nPierces hills and valleys,\nFloats and bears the weight of Heaven and Earth—\nOnly water can do this,\nThus, nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong.\nThis is so because, though it bends and twists in myriad ways,\nIt never loses its essence as water—\nAnd so there is nothing that can alter it.\"*\n\nThough water is soft and weak,\nAnd though all know that the soft and weak can overcome the hard and strong,\nLaozi repeatedly emphasizes this—why?\nBecause though all know it, none can practice it.\n\nThe clever and insightful may presume to govern,\nYet their flaw lies not in lacking strength,\nBut in their inability to diminish their excess to nourish the world,\nTo hold fast to the soft and weak,\nAnd to avoid being burdened by names, titles, wisdom, and the schemes of ministers and officials.\nThus, when Laozi concludes his discourse on *Dao* and *virtue*,\nHe repeatedly returns to this teaching,\nAnd cites the Sage’s words to affirm it:\n*\"To bear the world’s impurities is to be called the master of the state and soil;\nTo bear the world’s misfortunes is to be called the king of the world.\"*\nThis makes clear that the way to serve the world lies here, not there.\n\nNow, the kings of the Three Dynasties first sought fame,\nYet they said: *\"To bear the world’s impurities and misfortunes—\nThis is to be the master of the state and soil, the king of the world.\"*\nWhy?\nBecause those who seek fame before its time\nAre neither excessive in their words nor deficient—\nTo bear the world’s impurities and misfortunes\nIs to exceed the bounds of fame,\nFor fame cannot encompass it.\nDeficient speech responds to circumstances,\nCircumstantial speech varies with events.\nExcessive speech embodies the Dao,\nDao-embodying speech is true.\nThus, *straight speech as if reversed*—\nThe words of Tang and Wu say:\n*\"All under Heaven has guilt, resting upon me alone.\"*\nThis is the one who knows how to bear the world’s impurities and misfortunes.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine: Harmonizing Great Grievances**\n\nTo harmonize great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances—\nHow then can this be called good?\nThus, the Sage holds the left contract but does not demand repayment from others.\nTherefore, the virtuous oversee the contract,\nThe unvirtuous oversee the execution.\nHeaven’s Dao has no favorites—\nIt always sides with the good.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"One who seeks vengeance does not break the ancestral tablet,\nThough harboring resentment, they do not blame the falling tiles.\"*\nThus, the world is balanced.\n\nWithout this Dao, grievances arise,\nAnd though people seek to harmonize them, the entanglements cannot be undone—\nHence, *to harmonize great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances.*\nThe unvirtuous, I also treat with virtue—\nThis is how virtue is cultivated.\nYet to harmonize great grievances while still leaving lingering ones—\nHow can this be called good?\n\nThus, the Sage holds the left contract but does not demand repayment from others—\nThis ensures that those seeking vengeance do not break the ancestral tablet,\nThough harboring resentment, they do not blame the falling tiles,\nAnd the world is balanced in this way.\n\nIn ancient times, when presenting chariots and horses,\nThe right contract was held—\nThe right contract was for taking,\nThe left contract was for giving—\nThus, the left contract was always given to others and never kept.\nThe Sage acts but does not rely upon it,\nCompletes the deed but does not dwell upon it,\nAlways using his excess to nourish the world,\nYet when it comes to killing, he lets the proper officials execute it\nAnd never takes the blame himself—\nThis is holding the left contract to give to others\nWithout claiming ownership,\nAnd so there is no grievance and no demand for repayment.\n\nIs this because he takes pleasure in harmonizing?\nThus, the virtuous oversee the contract—\nThey simply do not demand repayment from others.",

      "translated_text": "The rites reached their fullest expression in the harmonization of the Three Sovereigns,\nand music attained its completeness in the perfection of the Six Dynasties.\nYet though their forms were perfected,\nthe rites did not place *xuanshui* and *dajeng* above *lizhou* and harmonized soups,\nnor did music elevate the *zhui* flute’s pure tones above the *zhusheng*’s resonant strings—\nfor this was to make people understand\nthat the intent of rites and music lay in what they could not avoid,\nwhile their true aim was to return to origins and begin anew.\n\nAt that very time,\nConfucius sought to restore and continue the fallen traditions of Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou,\nwhile Laozi expounded his Dao and its relation to the world in this very way—\nhis intent was no different.\n\nIt is like the moon reaching the *Wei* stem while Fire’s reign begins,\nyet the *jin* qi has already arisen within—\nthis is how the Five Phases succeed one another without interruption.\n\nThus, when one hears of ancient governance,\nthough there were ten or a hundred implements, they were not used,\nthough there were boats and carriages, they were not ridden,\nthough there were armor and weapons, they were not displayed—\nyet when great matters arose and great multitudes were gathered,\nit was only because there was no alternative.\n\nWhen one hears that the people used knotted cords for records,\nand neighboring states were within sight and hearing,\nyet grew old and died without crossing borders—\nthen the burdensome laws and exhaustive decrees,\nthe relentless inspections and urgent summonses,\nthe roads stretching to the borders of neighboring states,\nthe chariot tracks extending a thousand miles—\nthese were not by choice, but necessity.\n\nThus, what was unavoidable was always here,\nwhile what was sung of was always there—\nso why would one trouble oneself with excessive governance to correct the people’s faults?\n\nYet if one seeks to prevent the world from attaining peace and prosperity,\nit cannot be done.\n\nIf one cuts off the discussion, it is as if one were removing *xuanshui* and discarding *shuyue*—\nwho would then know the true intent of rites in their simplicity,\nor that music’s moderation was meant to return to origins and begin anew?\n\nThe words of the Sage—\nhow could they be mere trifling corrections?\n\n---\n**Chapter Eighty-One: Trustworthy Speech**\n\nTrustworthy speech is not ornate,\nornate speech is not trustworthy.\nThe virtuous do not argue,\nthose who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not learned,\nthe learned are not wise.\nThe Sage has no accumulation—\nwhen he gives to others, he grows ever more abundant,\nwhen he shares with others, he grows ever more plentiful.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming,\nthe Dao of the Sage acts without contending.\nIt is said:\n*The Dao as a thing—*\nyou cannot see it, cannot hear it, cannot grasp it,\nyet it can be silently understood—\nnot through reasoning, but through direct attunement.\n\nThus, trustworthy speech is trust in this alone—\nwhy bother with ornate speech?\nOrnate speech is skill in this alone—\nwhy bother with argumentation?\nWise speech is knowledge of this alone—\nwhy bother with breadth?\n\nFrom this perspective,\nit is clear that ornate speech is untrustworthy,\nargumentation is unvirtuous,\nand breadth is unwise—\nfor they do not align with the Dao.\n\nThe Dao as a thing\nhas never been a thing at all.\nThe Sage, in harmony with the Dao,\nhow could he have any accumulation?\nOnly because he has no accumulation\ndoes he become one with all things.\nWhen all things become one with him,\nhe is supremely rich—\nthus, when he gives to others, he grows ever more abundant,\nwhen he shares with others, he grows ever more plentiful.\n\nIf he had accumulation,\nits use would have limits—\nhow could he grow ever more abundant and ever more plentiful?\n\nLaozi’s words—\nobserving inwardly into the heart,\nobserving outwardly into things,\ngazing upward to Heaven,\ngazing downward to Earth—\nnothing escapes his attunement—\nthis is trustworthiness.\n\nYet the lesser scholar hears and scoffs,\nthe world deems him unworthy—\nthis is unornate speech.\nHis words are closest yet point farthest—\nthis is virtue.\nYet he does not speak for pleasure—\nthis is non-argumentation.\nHis wisdom reaches the state of no-wisdom—\nthis is wisdom.\nYet his simplicity never strays from the heart—\nthis is not breadth.\n\nBut scholars seek it through ornate speech, argumentation, and breadth—\nthey stray far.\n\nThe Dao of Laozi\nconsiders accumulation insufficient—\neven the Sage abandons and rejects it—\nthis is non-accumulation,\nthus, in utter emptiness, he fulfills all things’ demands—\nthis is growing ever more abundant and ever more plentiful.\n\nYet scholars, unable to focus their hearts upon this,\ncannot attain it.\n\nAll things have what benefits them and what does not—\nwhat does not benefit them cannot but bring harm.\nOnly the Dao of Heaven,\nhaving nothing that benefits, has nothing that does not benefit—\nhaving nothing that does not benefit, it benefits without harm.\n\nAll things that act\ninevitably have self—\nhaving self, they contend.\nOnly the Dao of the Sage,\nthough acting, does nothing—\ndoing nothing, it has no self—\nhaving no self, it does not contend—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven alone.\n\n---\n**End of Volume Four of the *Daodejing* Transmission**\n---\n*#1* \"Rescue with sincerity\" [疑作『救之以质』]\n*#2* \"Why
